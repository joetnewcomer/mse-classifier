0,Alternative Almost Complex Structures,Alternative Almost Complex Structures,,"Let $V$ be a real vector space. An almost complex structure on $V$ is a map $J : V \to V$ such that $J^2 = -\mathrm{id}_V$ . An almost complex structure gives $V$ the structure of a complex vector space by defining $(a+bi)v = av + bJ(v)$ . The idea behind this definition is that $J$ represents multiplication by $i$ . What if you instead consider multiplication by other complex numbers? Let $n > 2$ be a fixed positive integer and let $J : V \to V$ be such that $J^n = -\mathrm{id}_V$ which I will refer to as an alternative almost complex structure . One can regard $J$ as trying to capture multiplication by $\zeta = \exp\left(\frac{\pi i}{n}\right)$ . In particular, as $\{1, \zeta\}$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$ , it is a basis for $\mathbb{C}$ as a real vector space. One can then endow $V$ with a complex structure by defining $(a + b\zeta)v = av + bJ(v)$ . Do alternative almost complex structures give rise to the same results as the standard almost complex structures? In particular, in the case where we extend them to bundle endomorphisms of the tangent bundle of a manifold. If not, what fails? If so, is dealing with almost complex structures easier than dealing with alternative almost complex structures?","Let be a real vector space. An almost complex structure on is a map such that .

12,Vector Component Transformation Matrix in Shilov's Linear Algebra,Vector Component Transformation Matrix in Shilov's Linear Algebra,,"I am working through Georgi Shilov's Linear Algebra, and I am having trouble understanding the vector component transformation matrix definition he gives in section 5.31. I will describe this definition below. Let $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n$ and $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n$ be two bases in a vector field of dimension $n$ such that for some quantities $p^{(j)}_i$ we have $$f_j = p^{(j)}_1 e_1 + p^{(j)}_2 e_2 + \dots + p^{(j)}_n e_n$$ Shilov now defines the matrix of the transformation from basis $\{e\}$ to basis $\{f\}$ as $$P =  \begin{bmatrix}  p^{(1)}_1 & p^{(2)}_1 & \dots & p^{(n)}_1 \\ p^{(1)}_2 & p^{(2)}_2 & \dots & p^{(n)}_2 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ p^{(1)}_n & p^{(2)}_n & \dots & p^{(n)}_b \end{bmatrix} $$ So, $P$ is the matrix with components of $f_i$ in terms of the basis ${e}$ as columns. Now, suppose we have some vector $x = \xi_1 e_1 + \xi_2 e_2 + \dots + \xi_n e_n = \eta_1 f_1 + \dots + \eta_n f_n$ . Then, the author claims that the matrix describing the transformation from the components $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n$ to the components $\eta_1, \dots , \eta_n$ is $$S = (P^{-1})^T$$ In my understanding, the ""matrix describing the transformation from the components $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_n$ to the components $\eta_1, \dots , \eta_n$ "" means that $$S\begin{bmatrix} \xi_1 \\ \xi_2 \\ \vdots \\ \xi_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \eta_1 \\ \eta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \eta_n \end{bmatrix}$$ However, that doesn't seem to be the case.

26,Is it important to understand Linear algebra geometrically?,Is it important to understand Linear algebra geometrically?,,"I am currently self studying linear algebra, using Axler's text. And I always find myself trying to picture every theorem and proposition by considering some low dimensional cases, in order to understand why the theorems make sense. As I get to the chapter for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, things are getting a bit abstract. Specifically, he proved that every linear operator over an odd dimensional real vector space must have an eigenvalue by using induction, he considered the case where $U$ is a $2$ dimensional invariant subspace of $V$, set $W$ such that $U\oplus W=V$. Then consider the projection of $T\vec w$ onto $W$ along $U$ as an operator in $L(W)$, which must have an eigenvalue $\lambda$ by induction hypothesis. In the end, he showed that $T-\lambda I$ is not injective, thus $\lambda$ is also an eigenvalue of $T$. I understand everything he's written, but failed to grasp the bigger picture as I can only imagine vector space up to $3$ dimensions (in which case $W$ is only one dimensional). The construction is remarkable for me, as two different linear operators have the same eigenvalue, which I have no idea what the picture would look like (e.g. where does the eigenvector lie on) in higher dimensional spaces. So my question: Is understanding linear algebra through picture important? In some sense, I feel like it helps me understand more why some theorems would be true, but the proofs/constructions do not rely on picture at all as they mostly involve algebraic manipulations.","I am currently self studying linear algebra, using Axler's text.

Suppose there is a function $f : \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that it satisfies the following 2 properties: $f(A\cdot B) = f(A)\cdot f(B),\ \forall A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} $ $f(\text{diag}(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}a_i$ , for any diagonal matrix $\text{diag}(a_1,a_2,...,a_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ whose diagonal entries (from top-left to bottom-right) are $a_1, ... ,a_n$ . Show that $f(A) = det(A) \text{ (determinant of A)} \; \forall A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , i.e., show that the above two properties characterize the determinant function for real square matrices. My solution : Suppose $A$ is not invertible. Then, we can find invertible matrices $P$ and $Q$ such that $Q^{-1} A P = A' $ is diagonal with ones or zeros on its diagonal. As $A$ is not invertible, $A'$ must have atleast one zero in the diagonal. Hence, $f(Q^{-1})f(A)f(P) = f(A') = 0$ , as $A'$ is diagonal with a zero in the diagonal. But, for any invertible matrix $C,$ $\ 1 = f(I) = f(CC^{-1}) = f(C)f(C^{-1}) \Rightarrow f(C) \neq 0$ . So, $f(Q^{-1})\neq 0$ and $f(P) \neq 0$ . Hence $f(A) = 0 = det(A)$ for any non-invertible $A$ . Next, we know that any invertible matrix $X$ can be written as a product of elementary matrices $X=E_1 ... E_n$ , so if we can show that for an elementary matrix $E$ , $f(E) = det(E)$ , then $f(X) = f(E_1)...f(E_n) = det(E_1)...det(E_n) = det(E_1...E_n) = det(X)$ , and hence we would be done. Hence, it suffices to prove that for an elementary matrix $E$ , $f(E) = det(E)$ . [One useful observation : Suppose $Y$ is a diagonalizable matrix, then $\ \exists$ invertible matrix $M$ such that $D = M^{-1} Y M$ is diagonal. Clearly, $f(D) = det(D) = $ product of diagonal entries, for any diagonal matrix $D$ . So, $det(Y) = det(D) = f(D) = f(M^{-1})f(Y)f(M) = f(Y)f(M^{-1}M) = f(Y)f(I) = f(Y)$ . So, $f(Y) = det(Y)$ for any diagonalizable $Y$ .] If $E$ is an elementary matrix corresponding to multiplication of a row by a non-zero constant $c$ , then $E$ would be diagonal with one diagonal entry $c$ and all other diagonal entries being $1$ , and hence $f(E) = c = det(E)$ . If $E$ is an elementary matrix corresponding to swapping row $i$ and row $j$ ( $i\neq j$ ), then E is symmetric, hence diagonalizable by the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices. Hence, $f(E) = det(E)$ , by above observation. If $E$ is an elementary matrix corresponding to adding $c$ times the ith row to the jth row ( $i\neq j$ ), then it is the square of the matrix $E'$ which corresponds to adding $c/2$ times the ith row to the jth row. So, $f(E) = f(E')^2$ . By taking $Z$ as the matrix which swaps row i and j (which is its own inverse), it can be shown that $Z^{-1} E Z$ = $E^T$ , so $f(E) = f(E^T)$ . As $EE^T$ is symmetric, by the spectral theorem for real symmetric matrices, it is diagonalizable, hence $f(EE^T) = det(EE^T)\Rightarrow f(E)^2 = det(E)^2 = 1^2 = 1.$ As $E'$ as defined before is an elementary matrix of the same type as $E$ , $f(E')^2 = 1$ as well. So, $f(E) = f(E')^2 = 1 = det(E)$ . This finishes the proof for real square matrices. Note that in the above proof, I never used the fact that the field is the field of real numbers, except for the part where I used the spectral theorem to conclude that a real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. But this is not true in every field ( Is symmetric matrix over a field F always diagonalizable? ).

Renfro's comments on this question.","I am a high school student and my formal Linear Algebra education consisted merely of the definition of matrices as a list of numbers and then some random properties. While reading the BetterExplained article on Linear Algebra and some of 3Blue1Brown's videos on the same did help, I still often face difficulties while solving problems and when I look up the solutions, all I'm thinking is ""Wait. You're allowed to do that to matrices too?"" So my question is - what can we do to these list of numbers that we can do to individual real and complex numbers? To clarify, I do know that we can add matrices by adding their individual elements together and multiply matrices in a row-column order and stuff like that. My doubts are along the lines of the ones listed below: Does imply that ? (where A, B, C and D are 4 non-singular matrices of appropriate orders) Is valid? (where A is a matrix and n is a natural number) Is multiplication of matrices commutative only when a matrix is being multiplied by a null matrix or unit matrix of appropriate order? Is the inverse of the matrix the same as the inverse of multiplied times to itself? I am not asking for proofs of the problems listed above - instead, I would greatly appreciate it if someone who has noticed some ""patterns"" in the doubts listed above would point me to some resource that I can study to clear all such doubts in my conceptual understanding.

I believe the answer to be no, but if the answer is yes, then these matrices form a counterexample to something (to be described below) I've been trying to prove recently in my PhD project. Let me give some context to my question by first indicating what I've tried and found out so far, and then giving some motivation and background after that. What I've tried: Both matrices have characteristic polynomial $${t}^{10}-2\,{t}^{9}-{t}^{8}-{t}^{7}+2\,{t}^{6}+6\,{t}^{5}-{t}^{3}-4\,{ t}^{2}-2\,t+1,$$ and they both have the same Frobenius/Rational canonical form, this being just the companion matrix of said polynomial: $$ F = \left[ \begin {array}{cccccccccc} 0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&-1 \\ 1&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&2\\ 0&1&0&0&0 &0&0&0&0&4\\ 0&0&1&0&0&0&0&0&0&1 \\ 0&0&0&1&0&0&0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0&1 &0&0&0&0&-6\\ 0&0&0&0&0&1&0&0&0&-2 \\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&1&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0&0 &0&0&1&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0&1&2\end {array}  \right] $$ So we know that $A$ and $B$ are similar over $\mathbb{Q}$ (as they are both similar to $F$ ). I have actually been able to show that $A$ is similar to $F$ also over $\mathbb{Z}$ . This was done using a ""lucky"" computer search: I ran through all size $10$ vectors $\vec v$ with entries in $\{-1,0,1\}$ and checked whether the matrix with columns $\vec v$ , $A \vec v$ , $\ldots$ , $A^9 \vec v$ had determinant $\pm 1$ . This was the case for a handful of $\vec v$ 's, so these matrices witness the integral similarity of $A$ and $F$ . The same search for $B$ did not yield any positive results though. I would like to try a search on a larger set of vectors, but this would require more computing power than I posess currently (being home for the summer holidays). If the matrices are not similar, this method will of course never give the answer though... From the above we nevertheless have the following equivalent question: Are the matrices $B$ and $F$ above similar over $\mathbb{Z}$ ? Another idea: Another idea I've had is to consider the matrices $A$ and $B$ (or $F$ and $B$ ) as matrices over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ for various choices of the prime $p$ . As this can be decided using the Frobenius form or Smith normal form. If there is a $p$ for which the matrices are not similar over $\mathbb{F}_p$ , then they are not similar over $\mathbb{Z}$ either.  So that would settle it. However, if for some large $p$ , $A$ and $B$ are similar over $\mathbb{F}_p$ , I hope that a the transformation matrix witnessing this similarity also could work over $\mathbb{Z}$ , because the $p$ is so large. This is just speculation though. My problem is that I'm not sure which software I could use to perform these finite field calculations effeciently. Any feedback on this is greatly appreciated! Motivation: This part will be a bit brief/cryptic, in order to keep it short, so please just let me know if I should give more details on something. This question has come out of my recent attempts to prove that shift equivalence implies flow equivalence for (certain) non-negative integral matrices and their associated shifts of finite type. The dynamical systems called shifts of finite type , which are associated to a non-negative integer matrix, are described in the introductory textbook ""An Introduction to Symbolic Dynamics and Coding"" by Douglas Lind and Brian Marcus. Shift equivalence of matrices and flow equivalence of shifts of finite type are also explained in the book (starting on pages 233 and 453). For non-negative integer matrices which are irreducible (meaning that for each $i,j$ $A^n(i,j) > 0$ for some $n$ ), it is known that shift equivalence implies flow equivalence. This is because in the irreducible case there is a complete algebraic invariant in terms of the defining matrix which determines flow equivalence. And it is not hard to see that shift equivalence over $\mathbb{Z}$ (which is weaker than mere shift equivalence) preserves the invariant. For reducible matrices, however, the invariant is a lot more complicated. So in this case it is an open problem whether shift equivalence (over $\mathbb{Z}$ ) implies flow equivalence. It is not clear at all whether shift equivalence preserves the invariant. There is a recent paper in another field which hints at this potentially being true, so that is why I've spent some time trying to prove it. After failing to prove it I started searching for counterexamples instead. There are counterexamples if one allows the matrices to have ""cyclic components"", meaning that one irreducible component is essentially a permutaton matrix, but this makes the shifts of finite type a bit ""degenerate"" in some sense, so I want to avoid that. The way shift equivalence over $\mathbb{Z}$ connects with similarity over $\mathbb{Z}$ is that this is actually equivalent, for matrices with determinant $\pm 1$ (i.e. those which are invertible over $\mathbb{Z}$ ). This is the case for $A$ and $B$ . The matrices $A$ and $B$ are constructed to not be flow equivalent. They both have a similar block structure which is a by-product of the construction (edit: see the comments for the block structure), but I have chosen to not get into that. Edit: Just to be clear, what I ""hope for"" is that the matrices are similar . For that would settle my underlying research question. If they turn out to not be similar (or if we cannot tell), then what I would like is to either try to construct some other matrices that might be similar (while still not being flow equivalent) based on the feedback here, or to try find some ""underlying reason"" why they can never be similar.

Well, though I never though about verifying it for any pathological case, I believe that the map $\det: M_n(K) \to K$ is surjective. That would mean that the quotient $M_n(K)/\mathcal{R}$ is at least the same cardinality as $K$ (because similar matrices have the same determinant, but I'm not sure about the converse. If it is true, matrix with the same determinant are similar, then cardinality equality would follow). I'm not sure how the operations can be extended. Maybe the quotient can be seen as a vector space over $K$ as well: scalar multiplication is surely well defined, but I'm not sure about the sum. If I restrict myself to some subset of $M_n(K)$, like the general linear group or the special linear group, could I get something more? And the interpretation or mathematical application is exactly what I long for.",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices', 'determinant', 'invariance']"

However, we could also define a different kind of ""matrix exponentiation"", which I'll write $e^{\circ A}$, where $(e^{\circ A})_{ij} = e^{A_{ij}}$, i.e. we just apply the exponential function to each element independently. After writing this question I guessed that the name of this operation would be ""Hadamard exponential."" An internet search revealed that it's mentioned by this name in a few textbooks and research papers, but in general I can find very little written about its properties from a linear algebra point of view. (I've edited this post to use what seems to be standard notation for the Hadamard exponential.) One obvious thing is that it inherits all the usual properties of exponentiation, as long as we use the Hadamrd product $(\circ)$ (i.e. per-element multiplication) instead of the usual matrix product. Then we can immediately apply results like the Schur product theorem to conclude that if $e^{\circ A}$ and $e^{\circ B}$ are both positive definite then so is $e^{\circ (A+B)}$. Another obvious property is that for real matrices, the elements of $e^{\circ A}$ are all positive, and hence the Perron-Frobenius theorem applies. However, what I would particularly like to know is whether anything can be said about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $e^{\circ A}$ in terms of the eigendecomposition of $A$.

First it defines External direct sum using a $+$ inside a $\square$ of a finite number of vector spaces over the same field (I understand ""external"" might mean ""not considering them as subspaces of something"") $V=V_1+...+V_n$ is defined component wise (as vectors themselves) This is fine, I am happy with this. Direct product next and we have a family $\funky{F}=\{v_i|i\in K\}$ the direct product is: $\Pi_{i\in K}V_i=\{f:k\rightarrow\cup_{i\in K}V_i|f(i)\in V_i\}$ At first this seems horrible but really it's not too bad, $f$ is acting as a projection to coordinates really. This is a vector space itself and thinking about it I ask myself ""How is that not the external direct sum (provided the family is finite)"" This is not what I was taught for sum take the plane $x=0$ and the plane $y=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, their union is just an extruded $+$ shape but what I was taught was the sum becomes all of $\mathbb{R}^3$ because the sum was defined as $\{u+v|u\in V_1 v \in V_2\}$ But anyway, that's direct product. External direct sum This time it is denoted not by a $+$ in a square but by a + in a circle with ""ext"" in superscript, due to lack of knowledge of the name of this symbol I must describe it to you. Anyway this sum is (on a family as above) $\{f:K\rightarrow\cup_{i\in K}V_i|f(i)\in V_i, f\text{ has finite support}\}$ finite support means $f(i)=0$ for all but a finite number of $i$ I dare not come up with examples because it's not finite. Lastly Internal direct sums This is written as a + with a circle around it, and it requires the following hold: The join of the family is V, that is: $V=\sum_{i\in K}S_i$ which is the more conventional sum I assume, and independence of the family, that is: $S_i\cap(\sum_{j\ne i}S_j)=\{0\}$ It notes that this second condition is stronger than pairwise disjoint, I cannot think of an example which shows this distinction and I'd like one. That's all the book does on these, unless they are used far later. What is going on here?

First it defines External direct sum using a $+$ inside a $\square$ of a finite number of vector spaces over the same field (I understand ""external"" might mean ""not considering them as subspaces of something"") $V=V_1+...+V_n$ is defined component wise (as vectors themselves) This is fine, I am happy with this. Direct product next and we have a family $\funky{F}=\{v_i|i\in K\}$ the direct product is: $\Pi_{i\in K}V_i=\{f:k\rightarrow\cup_{i\in K}V_i|f(i)\in V_i\}$ At first this seems horrible but really it's not too bad, $f$ is acting as a projection to coordinates really. This is a vector space itself and thinking about it I ask myself ""How is that not the external direct sum (provided the family is finite)"" This is not what I was taught for sum take the plane $x=0$ and the plane $y=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, their union is just an extruded $+$ shape but what I was taught was the sum becomes all of $\mathbb{R}^3$ because the sum was defined as $\{u+v|u\in V_1 v \in V_2\}$ But anyway, that's direct product. External direct sum This time it is denoted not by a $+$ in a square but by a + in a circle with ""ext"" in superscript, due to lack of knowledge of the name of this symbol I must describe it to you. Anyway this sum is (on a family as above) $\{f:K\rightarrow\cup_{i\in K}V_i|f(i)\in V_i, f\text{ has finite support}\}$ finite support means $f(i)=0$ for all but a finite number of $i$ I dare not come up with examples because it's not finite. Lastly Internal direct sums This is written as a + with a circle around it, and it requires the following hold: The join of the family is V, that is: $V=\sum_{i\in K}S_i$ which is the more conventional sum I assume, and independence of the family, that is: $S_i\cap(\sum_{j\ne i}S_j)=\{0\}$ It notes that this second condition is stronger than pairwise disjoint, I cannot think of an example which shows this distinction and I'd like one. That's all the book does on these, unless they are used far later. What is going on here? Also what do ""internal"" and ""external"" mean, I can't think of an example but I think it refers to a style of definition, I've come across and gotten used to similar things before.

I need to do this in a systematic manner so that each rotation has ""same probability"". In the $n=2$ case this is relatively easy, since any 2-dimensional rotational matrix can be written as: \begin{pmatrix} cos(\phi) & sin(-\phi) \\  sin(\phi) &  cos(\phi) \end{pmatrix} The rotation is characterized by a single number $\phi$ so I can sample the $\phi$ uniformly (equidistantly) on $[-\pi; \pi]$. In the $n=3$ case things get more difficult. There are 3 axes by which I can rotate, but the composition of these rotations is not commutative. So I could get biased results when I sample these 3 rotations uniformly. I was thinking about using the Euler's rotation theorem : in 3D space, any two Cartesian coordinate systems with a common origin   are related by a rotation about some fixed axis This means that the rotations in 3d are characterized by an axis and an angle. So, I could sample all possible axes of some fixed length and all possible rotations around such axis. But this approach is very nontrivial to generalize to arbitrary dimensions .
