(or, is there an obvious search term in OEIS that I'm missing?)

Here is the simplest way I can explain it: We have $N$ people Each person can be not chosen chosen once chosen twice Then we take all of the people who are chosen once or twice and order them in an ordered set. The question is: How many unique ordered sets $S$ (of any length $0\le|S|\le2N$ )  can we make as a function of $N$ ? For example, suppose there are $4$ people named $\{1,2,3,4\}$ Suppose: $1$ is chosen once $2$ is not chosen $3$ is chosen twice $4$ is not chosen Then one unique set might then be the ordered set $\{3,3,1\}$ . Another is $\{3,1,3\}$ . It seems clear that there are $3^N$ unique unordered sets, as for each person we have 3 options (not chosen, chosen once, or chosen twice). The part I find challenging is that a person can be chosen twice , and switching order with oneself in the ordered set does not lead to a different unique ordered set. Can anyone suggest the solution?

This problem can be though of by simplifying it to the fact there will always be 40 total moves, 20 of which will be down and 20 of which will be right to reach a valid end point. The solution involves using the algorithm for combinations, i.e. 40C20. Reading the responses it has been stated that order does not matter and as such this is a combination. However, traditionally I would think this would call for a permutation because although starting as (0,0) and going Right-Down or Down-Right both gets you to (1,1) they do so using different paths and I would think would need to be counted as unique.

Step 1: Show this identity is true for a specific choice of $N=K$ LHS: $$\sum_{{m=K}}^{N} C(m,k) = \sum_{{m=k}}^{k} C(m,k) = C(k,k) = 1$$ RHS: $$C(N+1, k+1)$$ $$\text{Substitute } N=k $$ $$C(k+1, k+1) = C(K+1, K+1) = 1$$ Step 2: Assume this identity is true for any $N$ Step 3: Prove this identity is true for $N=N+1$ : LHS: $$\sum_{{m=k}}^{N} C(m,k)$$ $$\text{Substitute } N=N+1 $$ $$ \sum_{{m=k}}^{N+1} C(m,k)$$ RHS: $$C(N+1, K+1)$$ $$\text{Substitute } N=N+1 $$ $$C(N+1+1, k+1) = C(N+2, K+1)$$ Now, prove that LHS=RHS, i.e. $$\sum_{{m=k}}^{N+1} C(m,k) = C(N+1+1, k+1) = C(N+2, K+1)$$ We start by showing: $$\sum_{{m=k}}^{N+1} C(m,K) = \color{red}{\sum_{{m=k}}^{N} C(m,k)} + \sum_{{m=N+1}}^{N+1} C(m,k) = \color{red}{C(N+1, k+1)} + C(N+1, k)$$ Note that $\color{red}{\sum_{{m=k}}^{N} C(m,k)} = \color{red}{C(N+1, k+1)}$ is assumed to be true because of Step 2. Next, we continue the proof to show: $${C(N+1, k+1)} + C(N+1, k)$$ $$ = \frac{(N+1)!}{(K+1)!(N-K)!} + \frac{(N+1)!}{(K)!(N+1-K)!}$$ Using the idea that in general, $n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$ , we write: $$\frac{(N+1)!}{(K+1)!K!(N-k)!} + \frac{(N+1)!}{K!(N-k)!(N+1-k)}$$ Looking for common terms, we write: $$\frac{(N+1)!}{K!(N-k)!} \left[ \frac{1}{(K+1)} + \frac{1}{(N+1-k)} \right]$$ $$= \frac{(N+1)!}{K!(N-K)!} \left[ \frac{N+1-K + K+1}{(K+1)(N+1-k)} \right]$$ $$=\frac{(N+1)!}{K!(N-K)!} \left[ \frac{N+2}{(K+1)(N+1-k)} \right]$$ Now, using the following identities based on $n! = n \cdot (n-1)!$ : $$(N+1)! (N+2) = (N+2)!$$ $$K!(K+1) = (K+1)!$$ $$(N-k)!(N+1-K) = (N+1-k)!$$ We can now write: $$\frac{(N+1)!}{K!(N-K)!} \left[ \frac{N+2}{(K+1)(N+1-k)} \right] = \frac{(N+2)!}{(K+1)!(N+1-k)!} = C(N+2, K+1)$$ And this is exactly what we were trying to show in Step 3: $$\text{Original Identity: }  $$ $$\sum_{{m=k}}^{N} C(m,k) = C(N+1, k+1)$$ $$\text{Substitute } N=N+1 $$ $$\sum_{{m=k}}^{N+1} C(m,k) = C(N+1+1, k+1) = C(N+2, K+1)$$ Thus, this concludes the proof. Note that Step 3 was not possible to prove without the assumption in Step 2 being a valid assumption (i.e. Step 3 serves to validate the assumption taken in Step 2). Now, here is where my question begins: My prof told me that my work looks correct (the prof didn't do a full review, but looked at it quickly), but I personally don't agree with this proof. In general, I am confused how mathematical induction proofs work in general. Here is my attempt to justify this proof: In Step 1, we proved that this identity true for a specific choice of $N=K$ , e.g. $N=1$ In Step 2, we assumed that this identity is true for any $N$ . The way I see it as that suppose we took the case of $N=5$ , we use $N=1$ as stepping stones to reach $N=5$ But I am confused about Step 3. It seems the main argument is that Step 3 can only be true if our assumption about Step 2 is true. But isn't the $N+1$ case contained within the $N$ case? If we assume this identity is true for the general $N$ case (as we did in Step 2), are we not forced to accept it must also be true for the $N+1$ case? When we say any $N$ , isn't $N+1$ also ""any $N$ ""? Is $N+1$ a general case?

92,Number of binary strings with $k$ ones or $k$ zeros and no three consecutive ones,Number of binary strings with  ones or  zeros and no three consecutive ones,k k,"I have been trying to find a way to count the number of binary strings of length $n$ such that it has no three consecutive $1$ 's, but also either has exactly $k$ $1$ 's or exactly $k$ $0$ 's. For example, if $n = 4$ and $k = 3$ , then there are six valid such binary strings: $0001$ , $0010$ , $0100$ , $1000$ , $1011$ , and $1101$ . Similar to this post , we can model the problem with a recurrence relation. My first attempt is to define the recurrence relation $F(n,p,q)$ denoting the number of binary strings of length $n$ with no three consecutive $1$ 's with exactly $p$ $1$ 's and $q$ $0$ 's. Here, I have $F(n,p,q) = F(n-3,p-2,q-1) + F(n-2,p-1,q-1) + F(n-1,p,q-1)$ for $n \geq 4, p \geq 2, q \geq 1$ , with the following initial conditions: $$ F(n,p,q) = \begin{cases}     0 & \text{if } n = 0, \text{ or } p + q \neq n\\     1 & \text{if } p = 0, q = n\\     n & \text{if } p = 1, q = n - 1 \text{ or } n = p = 2, q = 0\\     3 & \text{if } (n,p,q) = (3,1,2) \text{ or } (n,p,q)=(3,2,1) \end{cases} $$ Essentially, the recurrence relation is derived from how such binary strings of length $n$ can be formed by strings of the form $s011$ , $s01$ , or $s0$ , where $s$ is again a binary string with no three consecutive ones of length $n-3$ , $n-2$ , or $n-1$ , respectively. The string $s011$ adds two extras $1$ 's and one extra $0$ to $s$ . The string $s01$ adds one extra $0$ and one extra $1$ to $s$ . Lastly, the string $s0$ adds an extra $0$ to $s$ . Notice that to get the answer to our original problem, we can define a function $\tilde{F}(n,k)$ representing the number of binary strings of length $n$ with no three consecutive ones consisting of either $k$ ones or $k$ zeros as $$ \tilde{F}(n,k) =  \begin{cases}     F(n,n/2,n/2), \text{ if $n$ is even and $k = n/2$} \\     F(n,k,n-k) + F(n,n-k+k), \text{ otherwise} \end{cases} $$ Using the idea from this post , we can use generating functions to count the exact formula for the recurrence relation $F(n,p,q)$ . After doing some calculations (you can see the detail here if interested), this is the generating function I found we can use for $F(n,p,q)$ : $$ G(x,y,z) = \sum_{n \geq 0, p \geq 0, q \geq 0} F(n,p,q) x^n y^p z^q = \frac{2x^3y^2z - x^2y^2 - x^2yz - xy - xz}{x^3y^2z + x^2yz + xz - 1} $$ Now, the question is how do we compute the coefficient $[x^ny^pz^q] \left( \frac{2x^3y^2z - x^2y^2 - x^2yz - xy - xz}{x^3y^2z + x^2yz + xz - 1} \right)$ ? I am really new to generating functions and have been struggling because of how the denominator cannot be factorized, hence we cannot do any useful partial fractions on it. Also, I have not been very successful in finding a common series similar to the one we are investigating. Any ideas or sources that might be helpful to solve this? Is it even possible? If it is impossible, can we at least get the asymptotic upper bound for such a recurrence relation? I conjectured that the upper bound for $F(n,p,q)$ is exponential in terms of $n$ , $p$ , and $q$ , but I do not know how to prove it. Thanks in advance. Update : As suggested by @VTand, we can redefine $F$ in terms of only $p$ and $q$ as $n$ is a redundant variable. Then, we have $F(p,q) = F(p-2,q-1) + F(p-1,q-1) + F(p,q-1)$ for $p \geq 2, q \geq 1$ with these initial conditions: $$ F(p,q) = \begin{cases}   0 & \text{if $q = 0, p > 2$}\\   1 & \text{if $p = 0$ or $(p,q) = (2,0)$}\\   q + 1 & \text{if $p = 1$} \end{cases} $$ Apparently, the generating function we can work with now is much simpler (you can see the calculation here if interested), that is: $$ G(x,y) = \sum_{p \geq 0,q \geq 0} F(p,q) x^p y^q = \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{1 - y(x^2 + x + 1)} $$ To calculate for $F(p,q)$ , we can use the value $[x^py^q] \left( \dfrac{x^2 + x + 1}{1 - y(x^2 + x + 1)} \right)$ , i.e. the coefficient of $x^py^q$ of the power series $G(x,y)$ .
