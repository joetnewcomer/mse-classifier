Does this mean that it won't converge to zero on a computer?","This question already has an answer here : Convergence of the fixed point iteration for sin(x) (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago . Is it mathematically correct to say that $\sin(x)$ converges to zero as $x$ approaches $0$? If the $\sin(x)$ iteration is done starting at $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ in Java, for $10^9$ iterations, the result is $5.4772255370828254\times 10^{-5}$. Even with the range of the integer data type exhausted, the result is not displaying $0$.
