0,Why is $V(x)\cup(\mathbb{A}^2\setminus V(y))$ not quasi-affine?,Why is  not quasi-affine?,V(x)\cup(\mathbb{A}^2\setminus V(y)),"I'm having trouble understanding the following situation. Apparently it's not difficult to see the union $V(x)\cup(\mathbb{A}^2\setminus V(y))$ is not a quasi-affine set. Everything is being done over an algebraically closed field, and the $V(-)$ are the closed sets. So I think I have $$ V(x)=\{(a_1,a_2)\in\mathbb{A}^2:f(a_1,a_2)=0\} $$ where $f(x,y)=x$. So $V(x)=\{(0,b)\in\mathbb{A}^2\}$, the $y$-axis. Likewise $V(y)$ is the $x$-axis. So I think $V(x)\cup(\mathbb{A}^2\setminus V(y))$ is geometrically the plane with the $x$-axis removed, except for the origin. Is it somehow clear this is not quasi-affine? If this could be expressed as the set theoretic difference of closed sets, I believe it would have to be something like $\mathbb{A}^2\setminus Z$ where $Z$ is the $x$-axis except for the origin. It doesn't seem likely that there is a family of functions vanishing only there, is there a nice way to see it more rigourously?","I'm having trouble understanding the following situation.

By a theorem, we have the unique writing $W = \displaystyle\bigcup_{i=0}^{n} w_i$ where the $w_i$ are disjoint and irreducible.

It's clear that their union is $V$ and that they are mutually disjoint, but I have no idea how to prove they are irreducible. I have tried assuming there are algebraic sets such that $A\cup B = V \cap w_i$ for fixed $i$, and hoping to contradict the irreducibility of $w_i$ with some set algebra, but I didn't get very far.

I would appreciate your opinion (is it true?) The critical points $\{c_k\}$ are the zeros of the leading coefficients as well as the zeros of the discriminant of the polynomial above, which I'll denote by $P(w,z)$ from now on. Since the leading coefficient $a_0(z)=1$ is non-vanishing, the critical points can only occur as zeros of the discriminant of $P(w,z)$ (which is the resultant of $P$ and $P_w)$. According to my calculations (i.e. obtaining the resultant by a sequence of polynomial divisions, starting with $P$ divided by $P_w$)  the discriminant is $3z^4-3z$ . It has zeros whenever $z_0=0$ or $z_k=\exp(2\pi ik/3)$ for $k \in \{1,2,3\}$. According to the analysis on page 304, all points $\{z_k \}_{k=0}^3$ are ordinary algebraic singularities. We are left with examining the point $z=\infty$. Unfortunately, the book only finds a bound on the degree of the pole at infinity. Moreover, it is not even guarantee that it is a pole (apparently, it could also be an ordinary point).

I would very much appreciate a hint to move me past the point at which I'm stuck. Here is my work so far: The setting is that $X$ is an affine algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ and $U$ is an open affine subvariety.  At first I thought that $k[U]$ would necessarily be a localization of $k[X]$ and then it would automatically be flat. Then I learned (e.g. see Hailong Dao's example here ) that this doesn't have to be so because a function on $k[U]$ could be locally a quotient of functions in $k[X]$ at every point of $U$ without being a quotient globally on all of $U$. However, flatness is a very local property, so this shouldn't be a terminal problem. At each point of $U$, $k[U]$ is a localization of $k[X]$. Here's what came out when I tried to make this thought precise: $k[U]$ is flat over $k[X]$ if $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ for all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ of $k[X]$. Now if $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponds to a point $p$ of $X$ that is in $U$, then $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}=k[X]_\mathfrak{m}=\mathcal{O}_{X,p}$. Since any ring is flat over itself, for $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponding to $p\in U$, we have what we need. This also seems to be the argument given by James Milne in his notes (see p. 146, footnote 1). However, I am unsatisfied.  To apply the theorem that flatness is local, I need to localize at every maximal ideal of the base ring, which in this case is $k[X]$.  I localized at all $\mathfrak{m}$ corresponding to $p\in U$; but what about the maximal ideals of $k[X]$ corresponding to points outside $U$? Is it obvious that $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ in these cases? I have gotten as far as trying to describe the rings $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ and $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ to myself in these cases. $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is functions regular on $U$ divided by functions nonzero at $p\notin U$. $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ is functions regular on all of $X$ divided by functions nonzero at $p$. This can now be a smaller ring, so it is no longer any more clear to me that $k[U]_\mathfrak{m}$ is flat over $k[X]_\mathfrak{m}$ than it was that $k[U]$ was flat over $k[X]$ in the first place. This is where I'm stuck. Further thoughts: although I haven't seen so far how to make this local proof work, the basic logic of working locally seems inescapable to me: after all, $k[U]$ consists of quotients of functions from $k[X]$. Shouldn't it be flat for ""essentially the same reason"" that localizations are flat? At any rate, a hint to push me past this stuck point would be much appreciated.

I'm creating an AI for this game that needs to compute the trajectory its bullet should have in order for the bullet orbit the planet and eventually hit its enemy. If we assume that the velocity of the bullet and space ship are constant, the problem is very simple, there are tons of pages out there on how to lead a target, and I have implemented that target-leading algorithm in my game, but the bullet moves slow enough that by the time it reaches where the enemy space ship would have been, both the bullet and spaceships' velocity have changed due to gravity. My first idea was that the ship and bullet would be moving in an ellipse. I decided to look up the parametric equation for an ellipse, setting the X and Y functions equal to themselves, where the left side has the constants for the bullet's ellipse, and the right side has constants for the enemy's ellipse, and solving each equation for T, but I got lost there, and that won't cover parabolas and hyperbolas if the bullet or enemy reaches escape velocity. So, my question: Assuming the planet is centered at the origin and doesn't move, given my spaceship's position/velocity, the enemy spaceship's position/velocity, the mass of the bullet, and the speed that the bullet will be launched from my ship (not including the velocity of the ship itself), how do I calculate a normalized vector representing the direction my ship should fire so that it hits the enemy? It's ok if there are certain situations where it's impossible to hit the enemy - in those situations my ship can either not fire, or revert to the ""constant velocity"" formula. I'm sure there will be multiple (potentially infinite) solutions, i'm interested in the solution that will occur soonest. It's ok to ignore the possibility that the bullet hits the planet when computing which direction to fire in - once the direction is computed, i just need a way to check if the bullet's trajectory hits the planet before it hits the enemy. If it does, my ship just won't fire.

I decided to look up the parametric equation for an ellipse, setting the X and Y functions equal to themselves, where the left side has the constants for the bullet's ellipse, and the right side has constants for the enemy's ellipse, and solving each equation for T, but I got lost there, and that won't cover parabolas and hyperbolas if the bullet or enemy reaches escape velocity. So, my question: Assuming the planet is centered at the origin and doesn't move, given my spaceship's position/velocity, the enemy spaceship's position/velocity, the mass of the bullet, and the speed that the bullet will be launched from my ship (not including the velocity of the ship itself), how do I calculate a normalized vector representing the direction my ship should fire so that it hits the enemy? It's ok if there are certain situations where it's impossible to hit the enemy - in those situations my ship can either not fire, or revert to the ""constant velocity"" formula. I'm sure there will be multiple (potentially infinite) solutions, i'm interested in the solution that will occur soonest. It's ok to ignore the possibility that the bullet hits the planet when computing which direction to fire in - once the direction is computed, i just need a way to check if the bullet's trajectory hits the planet before it hits the enemy. If it does, my ship just won't fire. If it's very simple to find multiple solutions that's a possibility, but it's not at all a priority.",,"['geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'conic-sections', 'celestial-mechanics']"
