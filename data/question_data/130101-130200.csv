1,Learning how to determine the centralizers of semisimple elements of finite groups of Lie type?,Learning how to determine the centralizers of semisimple elements of finite groups of Lie type?,,"Suppose that $s$ is a semisimple element of a finite classical group of Lie type $G=G(q)$ such that $\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_n$ are eigenvalues of $s$ (counting multiplicities).

W. Carter : Centralizers of semisimple elements in finite classical groups. As I skimmed the paper, the method mentioned there needs to know the theory of linear algebraic groups and so on.

2,Why are these definitions of groups of central type equivalent?,Why are these definitions of groups of central type equivalent?,,"Let $G$ be a finite group.

(In other sources, the quotient $G/Z(G)$ is called to be of central type, where $G$ satisfies above property). For each 2-cocycle $f \in Z^2(G, \mathbb{C}^*)$, a complex twisted group algebra, denoted by $\mathbb{C}^fG$, is defined by extending the multiplication $g_1.g_2:=f(g_1, g_2)g_1g_2$, $\forall g_1, g_2 \in G$, to all linear combinations of elements of $G$ with coeffecients in $\mathbb{C}$.

To see this, note that if $n \sqrt{2} =360 k$ for some $n,k \in \mathbb Z \setminus \{0\}$ then $$ 2n^2 = 360^2 k^2$$ which is equivalent to $$ \left({n \over k}\right)^2 = {360^2 \over 2}$$ ${360^2 \over 2}$ is an integer which implies $k=1$ . So we have $$ n^2 = {360^2 \over 2} = 64800$$ Now note that $254^2=64516$ < 64800 < 255^2=65025$$ This concludes the proof.

32,Proof that solvable permutation group whose fixed point set is restricted contains regular normal subgroup or Frobenius group on orbits,Proof that solvable permutation group whose fixed point set is restricted contains regular normal subgroup or Frobenius group on orbits,,"Let $p$ be a prime. Let $G$ be a solvable, non-regular, transitive permutation group such that some element fixes no point, and each element fixing some point fixes exactly $p$ points. Suppose that for $g \notin N_G(G_{\alpha})$ we have   $$  G_{\alpha}^g \cap G_{\alpha} = 1 $$   and that $p$ does not divide the order of $G_{\alpha}$. Then $G$ has a regular normal subgroup $R$ or $G$ has an intransitive normal subgroup $F$ of index $p$ which acts as a Frobenius group on its $p$ orbits. Proof: Let $G$ be a counter-example of minimal order. Let $N$ be an elementary abelian normal subgroup of $G$. As $N_{\alpha} \le G_{\alpha}$, but $p$ does not divide the order of $G_{\alpha}$ we have $N_{\alpha} = 1$, i.e. $N$ acts semi-regularly on $\Omega$. Since $G$ is a counter-example, $N$ is not transitive. Let $\Sigma$ be the orbits of $N$, and let $\Delta$ be the orbit containing $\alpha$. Then $G/N$ acts on the set $\Sigma$ and $G_{\alpha}N / N$ is the stabilizer of $\Delta$.  Let $\overline \alpha$ be the set of fixed points of $G_{\alpha}$. Since $G$ acts transitive, the size of each block divides the order of $G$, and hence $\overline \alpha$ is a minimal $G$-block. Also since the orbits of $N$ are $G$-blocks, we have that either $\Delta \cap \overline \alpha = \overline \alpha$ or $\Delta \cap \overline \alpha = \{\alpha\}$. Let $g \in G_{\alpha}$ and assume that $g$ fixes an orbits $\Delta'$ of $N$, i.e. $\langle g \rangle$ opertes on $\Delta'$. If $g$ would have no fixed point, then we would have by an orbit decomposition that $|\Delta'| = k\cdot o(g)$ for some $k$. But $|\Delta'| = |N|$, which is a $p$-group, and $o(g)$ does not divide $p$, so $g$ must have a fixed point in $\Delta'$ (which must come from $\overline a$). Hence if $\overline \alpha \subseteq \Delta$, $G / N$ acts as a Frobenious group on $\Delta$ and the action of $G/N$ on $\Sigma$ is faithful. I do not understand why $G/N$ acts as a Frobenious group, i.e. that it is non-regular and each $gN$ fixes at most one point. If $gN$ fixes some point, then this is equivalent to the statement that $g$ fixes some orbit $\Delta'$ of $N$, but in general we do not have $g \in G_{\alpha}$, so I do not see how the previous comments apply? Let $R / N$ be the Frobenious kernel. Then $R$ acts regularly on $\Omega$, which is impossible. If $r \in R, r \ne 1$ would fix some $\beta^r = \beta$ and $\Delta'$ denotes the orbit of $N$ containing $\beta$, then as this is a block we would have $(\Delta')^r = \Delta'$, i.e. $rN$ fixes a point, which is not possible by definition of the kernel. So this is clear to me. Therefore each of the orbits of $N$ contains at most one of the points of $\overline \alpha$ and $G / N$ acts in such a way that some element fixes no point, and each element fixing some point fixes exactly $p$ points. Here I do not understand why $G/N$ acts in that way? If $|\Sigma| = p$ then $G$ would not be a counter-example. What condition is precisely violated so that this is not a counter-example? Hence $|\Sigma| > p$ and $G/N$ acts faithfully on $\Sigma$. Therefore the assertion holds for $G/N$. I do not see why the point stabilizers are not divisible by $p$ and the intersection of different conjugates of the point stabilizers is trivial? Again, if $R/N$ acts regularly on $\Sigma$ then $R$ acts regularly on $\Sigma$, which is impossible. Thus $G/N$ has an intransitive normal subgroup $F/N$ of index $p$ acting as a Frobenious group on its $p$ orbits. Each of the $p$ orbits of $F$ on $\Sigma$ contains exactly one of the points of $\overline \alpha$. Hence $F$ acts as a Frobenious group on $\Omega$, and we have a contradiction, proving the assertion. $\square$ I have some difficulty following the arguments in the proof. I have marked the parts I am unsure about. Maybe some additional remark, by saying $\overline \alpha$ is the set of fixed points of $G_{\alpha}$ we used the fact that each element from the point stabilizer has the same set of $p$ fixed points, i.e. the set $\overline \alpha$. This uses the assumption that different point stabilizers intersect trivial, I can supply a proof of this fact if wanted!","Let $p$ be a prime.

(2) $G$'s action on $A$ is faithful by construction; is its action on $\hat A$ faithful? (3) If its action on $A\setminus\{0\}$ is transitive, is its action on $\hat A\setminus\{0\}$ transitive? My intuition says yes to all 3 questions, but I really do not see the argument so I have no idea whether to trust it. I think it is based on the fact that (a) $A$ and $\hat A$ are isomorphic (though not canonically), and (b) $A$ is canonically isomorphic to $\hat{\hat{A}}$, and the canonical isomorphism commutes with the action of $G$. But logically these don't imply anything. I can't extract any info from (a) unless one of the isomorphisms $A\rightarrow\hat A$ commutes with the action of $G$ on each, but usually none of them do. And (b) has nothing direct to say about $\hat A$ or $G$'s action on it. It would be enough to conclude (1), (2) and (3) if I could guarantee that there is an isomorphism $A\rightarrow\hat A$ that commutes with the action of $G$ up to twisting $G$ by some automorphism . This seems potentially plausible to me but I don't see the argument; it's true in the one case I've worked out by hand ($A=C_7$, $G=C_6 = \operatorname{Aut} A$), but there are lots of special reasons why it should be true in that case.","Let $A$ be a finite abelian group and let $G\subset \operatorname{Aut}A$, with $G$ acting from the left. $G$ acts in a natural way (on the left) on $A$'s character group $\hat A$ by $g\chi = \chi\circ g^{-1}$.

Since $e_\lambda^p$ is not necessarily a standard Young Tableaux, while it is an idempotent (since it is equivalent to an idempotent), the left ideal generated by it should be coincided with one of those generated by a standard Young Tableaux?

Apologizing for my ignorance, but I have two questions that I cannot figure out straightforwardly following the derivations and arguments provided in the textbook: (1) It can be shown (Theorem 5.5) that any permutation on a Young Tableaux gives an equivalent representation, so that $e_\lambda^p \equiv p e_\lambda p^{-1}$ is equivalent to $e_\lambda$. Since $e_\lambda^p$ is not necessarily a standard Young Tableaux, while it is an idempotent (since it is equivalent to an idempotent), the left ideal generated by it should be coincided with one of those generated by a standard Young Tableaux? (2) Essentially primitive idempotent is defined (with more derivations given in the appendix IV of the textbook) as $e_\lambda \equiv s_\lambda a_\lambda$. I am wondering, by employing similar arguments used in the appendix (to be specific, one exchanges the line with column, symmetrizer with anti-symmetrizer in the arguments), it occurs to me that $\tilde{e}_\lambda \equiv a_\lambda s_\lambda$ is also essentially primitive idempotent . If I am wrong, which important piece I have missed, if not, will its corresponding left ideal be also coincided with some standard Young Tableaux ? If I stray too far away from the right track, please delete this question. Many thanks.",,"['group-theory', 'permutations', 'symmetric-groups', 'young-tableaux']"

The only reason I can think of is that the bias is a relic of a time before the reals were understood well enough for mathematicians to be comfortable dividing by irrationals, but I have been unable to find a source to corroborate or contradict this guess.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'soft-question', 'fractions']"

Then the explorers    reflected on the way in which Earth's number system developed, and found   evidence that the Martian system had a similar history. How many fingers would    you say the Martians had? $(a)\;10$ $(b)\;13$ $(c)\;40$ $(d)\;25$ P.S. This is not a home work. It's a question asked in an interview.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'puzzle', 'number-systems']"
96,A new imaginary number? $x^c = -x$,A new imaginary number?,x^c = -x,"Being young, I don't have much experience with imaginary numbers outside of the basic usages of $i$. As I was sitting in my high school math class doing logs, I had an idea of something that would allow solving for logs with negative bases or with negative arguments. Taking a similar idea to i, this number, when used as an exponent, would result in a negative number. In other words, as the title says, $x^c = -x$. For starters, I just quickly mentally ran through simple examples of how it could be used in these cases, (ex. $\log(-100) = 2c$) but I soon began to wonder if it could have other applications and or just if it could be anything else. I'm also not 100% sure what to tag it, so I kinda guessed.","Being young, I don't have much experience with imaginary numbers outside of the basic usages of $i$.

We're factoring polynomials and had the same thought at the same time: when will we use this? I feel a bit silly because it always bugged me when people asked that in grade school.  However, we're both working professionals (I'm a programmer, she's a photographer) and I can't recall ever considering polynomial factoring as a solution to the problem I was solving. Are there real world applications where factoring polynomials leads to  solutions? or is it a stepping-stone math that will open my mind to more elaborate solutions that I actually will use? Thanks for taking the time!","The wife and I are sitting here on a Saturday night doing some algebra homework.

99,What Is Exponentiation?,What Is Exponentiation?,,"Is there an intuitive definition of exponentiation? In elementary school, we learned that $$ a^b = a \cdot a \cdot a \cdot a \cdots (b\ \textrm{ times}) $$ where $b$ is an integer. Then later on this was expanded to include rational exponents, so that $$ a^{\frac{b}{c}} = \sqrt[c]{a^b} $$ From there we could evaluate decimal exponents like $4^{3.24}$ by first converting to a fraction. However, even after learning Euler's Identity, I feel as though there is no discussion on what exponentiation really means . The definitions I found are either overly simplistic or unhelpfully complex. Once we stray from the land of rational powers into real powers in general, is there an intuitive definition or explanation of exponentiation? I am thinking along the lines of, for example, $2^\pi$ or $3^{\sqrt2}$ (or any other irrational power, really). What does this mean? Or, is there no real-world relationship? To draw a parallel to multiplication: If we consider the expression $e\cdot \sqrt5$, I could tell you that this represents the area of a rectangle with side lengths $e$ cm and $\sqrt5$ cm. Or maybe $e \cdot \pi$ is the cost of $\pi$ kg of material that costs $e$ dollars per kg. Of course these quantities would not be exact, but the underlying intuition does not break down. The idea of repeated addition still holds, just that fractional parts of terms, rather than the entire number, are being added. So does such an intuition for exponentiation exist? Or is this one of the many things we must accept with proof but not understanding? This question stems from trying to understand complex exponents including Euler's identity and $2^i$, but I realized that we must first understand reals before moving on the complex numbers.","Is there an intuitive definition of exponentiation?
