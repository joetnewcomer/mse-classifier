For linear recurrences with constant coefficients we get rational functions. Suppose that we are limited to real partial fractions. We have rational function $$\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}.$$ We have following cases: Denominator has distinct linear factors (we do not consider complex numbers). Here it is easy to calculate $n$ th derivative or simply get geometric series. Denominator has distinct irreducible quadratic factors. Here we know that \begin{align*}\operatorname{OGF}\left (\sin \left (\frac{\pi}{2}n\right )\right ) & =\frac{x}{1+x^2}, \\ \operatorname{OGF}\left (\cos \left (\frac{\pi}{2}n\right )\right ) & =\frac{1}{1+x^2}. \end{align*} But in this case we have following fractions: $$\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+px+q}.$$ Can we conclude something if we complete the square in the denominator? Is there shift property like in Laplace transform? Denominator has repeated factors (linear of irreducible quadratics). Here we have that $$\operatorname{OGF}(f*g)=F(x)G(x),$$ but convolution is given by sum instead of an integral $$(f*g)(n)=\sum \limits _{k=0}^nf(k)g(n-k).$$ Maybe this question help me. What is $\operatorname{OGF}(a^n\cos (\omega n+\theta ))$ or $\operatorname{OGF}(a^n\sin (\omega n+\theta ))$ ? I think that one of these is enough. Is it necessary to play with complex numbers to get this $\operatorname{OGF}$ ?

1,Finding a simpler form for a sum involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients,Finding a simpler form for a sum involving harmonic numbers and binomial coefficients,,"I was trying to simplify the expression $\displaystyle \sum_{j=k}^n j(j-1) {n \brack j} {j \brace k}$ for $0 \leq k \leq n$ , where ${n \brack j}$ and ${j \brace k}$ denote the Stirling number of the first and second kind respectively. I ended up with the following equation, where $H_n$ denotes the n-th harmonic number: $$2 \cdot \Biggl[ \frac{n!}{(k-2)!} \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{n-k+1} H_j \frac{(-1)^{j+1}}{j+1} \binom{n+1}{k+j} + \frac{n!}{(k-1)!} \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{n-k} H_j \frac{(-1)^{j+1}}{j+1} \binom{n}{k+j} \Biggr] $$ Next up, I wanted to simplify the sums. After shifting the index by $k$ , $$ \displaystyle \sum_{j=k+1}^{n}  (-1)^{j-k+1} \binom{n}{j} \frac{H_{j-k}}{j-k+1} $$ it looks a lot like the following equation, where $H_n^{(2)} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{j^2}$ : $$\sum_{j=k+1}^n(-1)^{j-1}{n\choose j} \frac{H_j}{j}=H_n^{(2)} - H_k^{(2)}.$$ which can be proven according to the second answer in A finite sum involving the binomial coefficients and the harmonic numbers . But of course, some terms are shifted, while the binomial coefficient stays the same. I tried solving it similarly to the equation above using the binomila formula, but wasn't able to find a solution due to the shifted terms. At this point I'm not sure whether there is an easier form, but I thought someone might recognize it from somewehere or know a way to prove it. I will keep on trying to simplify it and update the question if I find a way. The reason the expression is interesting is that it can be used to calculate the Variance of the Lah-distribution, which is defined in Definition 1.1 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11365 . Although the authors do calculate a formula for the second moment in Corollary 3.6, I have used a different method to arrive at the above mentioned formula and am therefore interested whether you can find a nicer form for the second moment than Corollary 3.6 gives.

If $k$ is sufficiently large, then there exists a $k$ -uniform family $\mathcal{F}$ such that $|\mathcal{F}|\leq k^22^k$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is not $2$ -colorable. Proof: Set $r=[k^2/2]$ . Let $\mathbf{A}_1,\mathbf{A}_2,\dots$ be independent random members of $\binom{[r]}{k}$ , that is, $\mathbf{A}_i$ ranges over the set of all $A\subseteq \{1,\dots,r\}$ with $|A|=k$ , and $\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i=A]=\binom{r}{k}^{-1}$ . Consider the family $\mathcal{F}=\{\mathbf{A}_1,\dots,\mathbf{A}_b\}$ , where $b$ is a parameter to be specified later. Let $\chi$ be a coloring of $\{1,\dots,r\}$ in red and blue, with $a$ red points and $r-a$ blue points. Using Jensen's inequality, for any such coloring and any $i$ , we have $$\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i \ \text{is  monochromatic}]=\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i \ \text{is  red}]+\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i \ \text{is  blue}]=$$ $$=\dfrac{\binom{a}{k}+\binom{r-a}{k}}{\binom{r}{k}}\geq  \frac{2\binom{r/2}{k}}{\binom{r}{k}}:=p,$$ where, by the asymptotic formula $(1.9)$ for the binomial coefficients, $p$ is about $e^{-1}2^{1-k}$ . Since the members $\mathbf{A}_i$ of $\mathcal{F}$ are independent, the probability that a given coloring $\chi$ is legal for $\mathcal{F}$ equals $$\prod_{i=1}^b(1-\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i\  \text{is monochromatic}])\leq (1-p)^b.$$ Hence, the probability that at least one of all $2^r$ possible colorings will be legat for $\mathcal{F}$ does not exceed $2^r(1-p)^b<e^{r\ln 2-pb}$ , which is less than $1$ for $b=(r\ln 2)/p=(1+o(1))k^22^{k-2}e\ln 2$ . But this means that there must be at least one realization of the random family $\mathcal{F}$ , which has only $b$ sets and which cannot be colored legally. This is an excerpt from Jukna's ""Extremal combinatorics"" and I guess that there are some technical flaws in the reasoning, however, I understood the underlying idea of the proof. So let me ask my questions. Am I right that the author considers the finite probability space $(\Omega,\text{Pr})$ , where $\Omega=\{A\subset [r]: |A|=k\}$ , i.e. $|\Omega|=\binom{r}{k}$ with uniform distribution, i.e. $\text{Pr}[\omega]=\frac{1}{|\Omega|}$ for each $\omega\in \Omega$ ? I was able to show that for each coloring $\chi$ we have $$\text{Pr}[\{A\in \Omega: A \ \text{is monochromatic under coloring}\  \chi\}]=\binom{r}{k}^{-1}\left[\binom{a}{k}+\binom{r-a}{k} \right].$$ But I am really confused what does the author mean by $\text{Pr}[\mathbf{A}_i \ \text{is monochromatic}]$ . Can anyone explain what does this event mean?","Let be a family of subsets of some finite set.

A sequence member $s_{ijk}$ can be defined with $s_{ijk} \equiv s_0^{\beta^i\gamma^j\delta^k}\bmod N$ based at a starting value $s_0$ and three exponents $\beta,\gamma,\delta$ with their related exponents $i,j,k$ (one for each direction). Together they can describe a set of unique $B \times C \times D$ sequence members for well chosen parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta,N,s_0$ . ( $B$ would be the sequence length of $x \mapsto x^\beta \bmod N$ and $C$ of $x \mapsto x^\gamma \bmod N$ and $D$ of $x \mapsto x^\delta \bmod N$ and $x \mapsto x^\alpha \mod N$ would have length $B\cdot C\cdot D$ ) Given now a member $s_{ijk}$ I'm looking for the (computationally) fastest way to determine the indices $i,j,k$ . The difficulty seems to be related to chosen parameter. For some parameter a member $s_{ijk}$ can be projected to $3$ sequence with length $B,C$ and $D$ which makes solving the discrete logarithm with baby-step-giant-step-algorithm much easier. For some parameter it can not (Question: Or can it?) We pick a number $N = P\cdot Q\cdot R$ with $P,Q,R$ primes $$P = 2\cdot p+1$$ $$Q = 2\cdot q+1$$ $$R = 2\cdot r+1$$ with $p,q,r$ different primes and $\phi(\cdot)$ containing 4 primes each: $$p = 2\cdot p_1\cdot p_2\cdot p_3 +1$$ $$q = 2\cdot q_1\cdot q_2\cdot q_3 +1$$ $$r = 2\cdot r_1\cdot r_2\cdot r_3 +1$$ All odd prime factors are unique. (*) To get a sequence of length $L_{all}=(p_1p_2p_3)\cdot (q_1q_2q_3)\cdot (r_1r_2r_3)$ we set $\alpha=16$ . The sequence $x \mapsto x^\alpha \bmod N$ will have that many unique members for a starting value $x_0 \equiv s_0 \equiv n^\alpha \bmod N, n\in [2,N-1]$ (with some exceptions we won't focus here). Depending on starting value it can be part of one out of 8 disjoint sequences with that length (or some special case). To get a structure $B\times C \times D$ which is cyclic in 3 directions we can set the exponents $\beta, \gamma, \delta$ to different powers of $\alpha$ . For those powers we can use the prime factors of $L_{all}$ . If we set them to $$\beta_{easy} \equiv \alpha^{q_1 q_2 q_3 r_1 r_2 r_3} \mod \phi(N)$$ $$\gamma_{easy} \equiv \alpha^{p_1 p_2 p_3 r_1 r_2 r_3} \mod \phi(N)$$ $$\delta_{easy} \equiv \alpha^{p_1 p_2 p_3 q_1 q_2 q_3} \mod \phi(N)$$ we would get a structure $(B_{easy}=p_1p_2p_3) \times (C_{easy}=q_1q_2q_3) \times (D_{easy}=q_1q_2q_3)$ . All members $m_{easy}$ of this structure can be projected to a member of 3 much shorter sequences with $$|\{\forall m_{easy}: m_{easy}^p \bmod N\}|=B$$ $$|\{\forall m_{easy}: m_{easy}^q \bmod N\}|=C$$ $$|\{\forall m_{easy}: m_{easy}^r \bmod N\}|=D$$ This would make finding $ijk$ much easier. But if we mix those prime factors e.g.: $$\beta \equiv \alpha^{p_2 p_3 q_2 q_3 r_2 r_3} \mod \phi(N)$$ $$\gamma \equiv \alpha^{p_1 p_3 q_1 q_3 r_1 r_3} \mod \phi(N)$$ $$\delta \equiv \alpha^{p_1 p_2 q_1 q_2 r_1 r_2} \mod \phi(N)$$ We would get a structure $(B=p_1q_1r_1) \times (C=p_2q_2r_2) \times (D=p_3q_3r_3)$ . Given a member $m$ of that structure with $$m = s_{ijk} \equiv s_0^{\beta^i\gamma^j\delta^k}\mod N$$ there is no exponent $\xi$ which is able to project such member to a one-directional sequence of size $B,C$ or $D$ . $$\not\exists \text{ }  \xi \text{ with: } \text{ } |\{\forall m: m^\xi \bmod N\}| \in \{B,C,D\}$$ Or at least I found none in some tests (no proof here). Question : Given such a member $m = s_{ijk}$ and a starting value $s_0$ , the exponents $\beta, \gamma, \delta$ , the mod value $N$ , the structure size $B,C,D$ with their prime factors. Which would be the (computationally) fastest way to determine $i,j,k$ in $$m = s_{ijk} \equiv s_0^{\beta^i\gamma^j\delta^k}\mod N$$ or in other words is there some simplification for that problem which makes it (much more) faster solvable than the (advanced) naive way: surface around $s_0$ with $s_0^{\beta^i\gamma^j}\bmod N$ line starting at $m$ with $m^{\delta^k} \bmod N$ until match in between them This would take $O(B\cdot C + D)$ steps of calculation (we assume constant time for power/multiplication and other base operations in between values $<N$ ). Can it done faster/better? Some more details: Besides the exponents $\beta, \gamma, \delta$ their inverses $\beta^{-1}, \gamma^{-1}, \delta^{-1}$ are also known. So $(m^\beta)^{\beta^{-1}} = m \mod N$ . But we can assume the prime factorization of $N$ and with this $\phi(N)$ is not known. For simplification left out above but the true prime factors of $N$ will have an additional big factor like $P = 2 \cdot p \cdot p_{big} +1$ and with this $\alpha$ will be $\alpha = 16 \cdot p_{big} \cdot q_{big} \cdot r_{big}$ . (while factors $p,q,r$ will be relatively small - that't the indented purpose, big factors $2\cdot 3\cdot g+1$ with $g$ some big safe prime - Is there a better way?) Dimensions $B,C,D$ can be assumed to be (almost) the same size. Related to (*): The condition of all odd prime factors from $p,q,r$ being unique is not complete. Some test cases did not work out. Hints about this would be nice too. We can not reduce it to single series of length $B,C,D$ but we can project it to a smaller sub-structure, e.g.: $$\{\forall m: m^p \bmod N\} \equiv (q_1r_1) \times (q_2r_2) \times (q_3r_3)$$ $$\{\forall m: m^{p\cdot q} \bmod N\} \equiv (r_1) \times (r_2) \times (r_3)$$ But can this be reverted to help finding $i,j,k$ ? Alternative way of solving: Besides projecting the member to 3 shorter sequences we could also project it to a single sequence with length $L_{all}$ . We can use the exponent $\lambda = \beta\cdot \gamma\cdot \delta$ and find a solution for $m \equiv s_0^{\lambda^y} \bmod N$ . For $i,j,k$ we use $i = y \bmod B$ and $j = y \bmod C$ , $k = y \bmod D$ . If we know $\phi(N)$ this should take $O(\sqrt{L_{all}})$ steps of computation with baby-step-giant-step-algorithm. Or could we also use something similar to the Pohlig–Hellman algorithm here? However if we use some additional factors $p_{big}, q_{big}, r_{big}$ as described above we only know some factors of $\phi(N)$ . Without knowing it $\lambda^y$ with $y\approx \sqrt{L_{all}}$ can get very big. Would knowing $\alpha$ help here? Is there any alternative faster way than $O(\sqrt{L_{all}})$ ?

Color both connected components with $4$ colors and combine them to a coloring of $G$ . Now, if we manage to prove that there is a vertex $v \in V(G)$ with $\deg(v) \leq 3$ then we are done. Hence, suppose to the contrary that $\deg(v) \geq 4$ for all $v \in V(G)$ .

23,Discrete Dirichlet problem has a unique solution,Discrete Dirichlet problem has a unique solution,,"I am studying Artin's Algebra . In Chapter 1 Exercise M11, he asks to show that every discrete Dirichlet problem on a finite discrete set in plane has a unique solution. This is essentially the question: Let $R$ be a finite subset of $\mathbb{ Z\times Z}$ . Let $\partial R$ be the set of all the points, not in $R$ , which are unit distance away from some point in $R$ . Let $\beta$ be a function on $\partial R$ . Then we need to show that there exists a unique function $f$ on $R\cup \partial R$ such that $f(u, v) = \beta_{u, v}$ for all $(u, v)\in\partial R$ and that $f$ satisfies the discrete Laplace equation $^1$ for all points in $R$ . The full question can be found here . My attempt at solving this: After arbitrarily ordering $R$ , we get a linear system $LX = B$ to solve for $X$ where $B$ contains combinations of $\beta_{u, v}$ 's. We just need to show that any such $L$ is invertible, or equivalently, has a nonzero determinant. I abstracted out the following properties that any coefficient matrix $L$ must satisfy (possibly after a rearrangement of equations, provided that we write the equations as mentioned in the footnote): The diagonal entries are all $4$ . Nondiagonal entries can be either $0$ or $-1$ . Any row can have at most four $-1$ entries (since any point in $R$ can have at most four points in $\partial R$ that are a unit distance away from it). Any column in $L$ can also have a maximum of four $-1$ entries (since any point in $R$ can be a unit distance away from at most four points in $R$ ). Now I consider an arbitrary matrix $A$ satisfying the above properties. I rearrange the columns and rows (by elementary row and column operations) to get the following matrix: $$ \begin{bmatrix} B & \ast\\ \ast & B' \end{bmatrix}. $$ Here $B$ and $B'$ are matrices satisfying the above properties, with the additional condition on $B'$ : its first column is entirely nonzero, and contains all the $-1$ 's of the first column of the original $A$ . Thus $b'$ has size at most $5\times 5$ and at least $1\times 1$ . By induction, we can row reduce $B'$ to $I$ , and thus we can row reduce $A$ to $$ \begin{bmatrix} B' & 0\\ \ast & I \end{bmatrix}. $$ Now all I need to show is that $B'$ is also invertible. The brute force method contains $2^{20}$ cases with the general matrix to be analyzed for invertibility being $$ \begin{bmatrix} 4 & &\ast\\ &\ddots&\\ \ast&&4 \end{bmatrix}_{5\times 5} $$ with the nondiagonal entries being $-1$ or $0$ .

98,Structure of a periodic bijection on the set of bitstrings,Structure of a periodic bijection on the set of bitstrings,,"Let $S$ be the set of bitstrings of length $n$ i.e. strings of zeroes and ones. Let these bitstrings be ordered according to Hamming weight (i.e. number of ones in a string) and then by lexicographic order. Let $x\in S$ , let $W(x)=w$ be the Hamming weight of $x$ and we now define a $f:S\to S$ to be such that $f(x)=y$ where $y$ is $\delta=\lfloor\frac{2^n}{n}\rfloor \text{ (mod }2^n)$ places to the right of $x$ in the ordering described above. This defines a bijection on $S$ to itself. I am trying to find the structure of this bijection. Given $n$ and $w$ i.e. all those $x\in S$ s.t. $W(x)=w$ , I am trying to find how many of these bitstrings $x$ are mapped to which weight classes under $f$ . Would the analysis be easier if we choose another $\delta$ ? I am allowed to change $\delta$ with the constraint that it needs to grow exponentially and be $o(2^n)$ where $o(\cdot)$ stands for little-O. So we can choose $\delta=\lfloor\frac{2^n}{n^2}\rfloor$ or something like that if it makes analysis easy. My attempt: Let's say I want to look at the weight classes that bitstrings of $w=1$ are mapped to. Take the first $x$ , in the ordering, s.t. $W(x)=1$ . There are $\binom{n}{w}$ bitstrings for each $w$ . To find $y$ s.t. $f(x)=y$ is complicated because I would need to find $k$ s.t. $$\sum_{i=1}^k \binom{n}{i}<\frac{2^n}{n}<\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \binom{n}{i}$$ because that would mean $W(y)=k+1$ . But as we know there are known upper bounds for $\sum_{i=1}^k \binom{n}{i}$ and not a precise equality which makes finding such $k$ hard. Any ideas? EDIT: Explicit example of $f$ : Let $n=4$ . If we order the strings first according to weight and then by lexicographic order, then we get this order: $$0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,9,10,12,7,11,13,14,15$$ where the above numbers are decimal values of bitstrings.
