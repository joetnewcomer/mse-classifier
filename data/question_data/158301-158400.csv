10,Check perfect squareness by modulo division against multiple bases,Check perfect squareness by modulo division against multiple bases,,"I am interested in a quick test to see if a number is a perfect square.

Imagine that a friend ask me for a reasoning to get examples of irrational numbers of the form $$r^{\sqrt{2}},$$ when the real number $r$ runs on the set $0<r<1$. What is the reasoning that I should be tell my friend? If we want to create simple examples of irrational number of the form $r^{\sqrt{2}}$,     what are simple requirements/conditions that need to be met those real numbers $0<r<1$? Of course if you need theorems of the kind of Gelfond-Schneider's theorem, or a different approach you can combine with these statements in your discussion to get some examples using a mathematical reasoning. If you know literature you can reference it. Thanks in advance.",,['number-theory']

My attempt of understanding proof Let $f\in\mathbb{Q}_{p}[x]$ be the minimal polynomial of $\zeta$ over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. Question $(1)$. Is $f$ a polynomial with coefficientes actually in $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$? Why? If the above is true, then the polynomial $\overline{f}$obtained by reducing coeficients modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is monic and vanishes at the image $\overline{\zeta}$ of the element $\zeta$ by the canonical homomorphism $\mathcal{O}\to\mathcal{O}/\beta$, where $\mathcal{O}$ (resp. $\beta$) is the valuation ring (resp. maximal ideal) of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta)$. By the way, no doubt that $\zeta\in\mathcal{O}$. If we show that $\overline{f}$ is irreducible, then it is the minimal polynomial of $\overline{\zeta}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$. We know that $f$ is a primitive polynomial (since it is monic) and hence we can use Hensel's Lemma as a tool for that. Namely, if $\overline{f}$ is a product of coprime polynomials $\overline{g}$, $\overline{h}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$, each of degree $>1$, then $f$ would be a product of polynomials $g$, $h\in\mathbb{Z}_{p}[x]$, each of degree >1, a contradiction. However, we still need to prove that $\overline{f}$ is not a product of noncoprime polynomials. Neukirch says that since $\overline{f}$ divides the coefficient-reduced modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ separable polynomial $x^{n}-\overline{1}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$, this case cannot happen, but I don't understand this. Question $(2)$. Why is $x^{n}-\overline{1}\in\mathbb{F}_{p}[x]$ a separable polynomial? Question $(3)$. If $\overline{f}$ is separable, then can't it be a product of noncoprime polynomials? If the above is cleared, then we actually confirmed that $\overline{f}$ is the minimal polynomial of $\overline{\zeta}$. In particular, being irreducible gives us that $\operatorname{deg}(f)=\operatorname{deg}(\overline{f})$, which means \begin{equation} [\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta)\colon\mathbb{Q}_{p}]=\operatorname{deg}(f)=\operatorname{deg}(\overline{f})=[\mathbb{F}_{p}(\overline{\zeta})\colon\mathbb{F}_{p}]. \end{equation} On the other hand, we have that \begin{equation} [\mathbb{Q}_{p}(\zeta)\colon\mathbb{Q}_{p}]\geq [\beta\colon\mathbb{F}_{p}] \end{equation} Putting these two together gives $\mathbb{F}_{p}(\overline{\zeta})=\beta$ and hence the extension is unramified.

36,The existential theory is undecidable,The existential theory is undecidable,,"Lemma 1. For any $x$ in the ring $F[t,t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$), $x$ is a power of $t$ if and only if $x$ divides $1$ and $t-1$ divides $x-1$ (the divisibilities are meant, of course, in $F[t, t^{-1}]$). Lemma 2. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then for any $n$ in the ring $F[t, t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$), $n$ is a nonzero integer if and only if $n$ divides $1$ and either $n-1$ divides $1$ or $n+1$ divides $1$, and there is a power $x$ of $t$, so that $(x-1)/(t-1)  \equiv n \pmod {t-1}$. THEOREM. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is undecidable. PROOF. By Lemma 1, we can express the fact that an element $x$ in $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is a power of $t$ by an existential formula $\phi(x)$. By this and Lemma 2, we can express the fact that an element $n$ of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is an integer by the existential formula $$(\exists x)(\exists y) [\phi (x) \wedge x-1 = (t-1)n+y(t-1)^2] \wedge (\exists z)(\exists w) (nz =1 \wedge  ((n+1)w=1 \text{ or } (n-1)w=1)$$  Call the last formula $\psi(n)$. Assume for the sake of contradiction, that the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is decidable. Then we can algorithmically examine the solvability of a diophantine equation in the rational integers in the following way: if $P(X_1, \dots , X_n)=0$ is a given diophantine equation, we consider the existential formula $$(\exists x_1) \dots (\exists x_n) P(x_1, \dots , x_n)=0 \wedge \psi(x_1) \wedge \dots \psi(x_n)$$ Clearly, the equation of whether this sentence is true in $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is equivalent to the question of whether $P=0$ has integral solutions.

Could you explain to me the reduction to Hilbert's Tenth Probelm? I haven't really understood it... $$$$ $$$$ EDIT: Can we change the theorem and its proof as follows? THEOREM. We suppose that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then the positive existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is undecidable. Proof. We want to show that there is no algorithm, that given a positive existential sentence $\gamma$, it answers if $\gamma$ is true in the ring $F[t, t^{-1}$ or not.  According to Matijasevic, there is no algorithm that with input a polynomial $P(x_1, \dots , x_n)$ with integer coefficients, always decides if the equation $P(X-1, \dots , x_n)=0$ has an integer solution.  According to Lemma $1$, an element $x \in F[t, t^{-1}]$ is a power of $t$ iff $$x \mid 1 \ \ \land \ \ t-1 \mid x-1$$  So we can express the fact that an element $x \in F[t, t^{-1}]$ is a power of $t$ with the positive existential formula $$\phi (x) \ \ : \ \  \exists y \exists z ((xy=1) \land (x-1=(t-1)z))$$  According to Lemma $3$, $n$ is a nonzero integer iff $n \mid 1 \ \ : \ \ (\exists z)(nz=1)$ $n-1 \mid 1 \lor n+1 \mid 1 \ \ : \ \ (\exists w)((n+1)w=1 \text{ or } (n-1)w=1)$ there is a power $x$ of $t$ $\ \ : \ \ (\exists x) \phi (x)$ $(x-1)/(t-1) \equiv n \pmod {t-1} \ \ : \ \ (\exists y)((x-1)/(t-1)-n =y(t-1)) \Rightarrow (\exists y)(x-1-n(t-1)=y(t-1)^2) \Rightarrow (\exists y)(x-1=n(t-1)+y(t-1)^2)$ So we can express the fact that an element $n \in F[t, t^{-1}]$ is an integer with the positive existential formula $$\psi (n) \ \ : \ \ (\exists x)(\exists y)[\phi(x) \land x-1=(t-1)n+y(t-1)^2] \land (\exists z)(\exists w)(nz=1 \land ((n+1)w=1 \text{ or } (n-1)w=1)$$  We suppose that the positive existential formula of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is decidable, so there is an algorithm that decides if a positive existential sentence is true in $F[t, t^{-1}]$.  Then the problem if a diophantine equation has an integer solution is decidable:  the diphantine equation $P(x_1, \dots , x_n)=0$ has an integer solution iff the positive existential sentence $$(\exists x_1) \dots (\exists x_n) ((\psi (x_1) \land \dots \land \psi (x_n)) \land P(x_1, \dots , x_n)=0)$$ is true in $F[t, t^{-1}]$.

This led me to consider $S_n= (p_n-1)/\phi(p_n-1)$ . $S_n$ is the reciprocal of the primitive root fraction, chosen because ""unbounded"" is easier to think about than ""not bounded away from zero"". And since number theory isn't my forte, I decided to investigate numerically. For a lower bound, numerics suggest $\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}S_n = 2$ . I can easily show this follows from the conjecture that there are infinitely safe primes, but I'm not sure about whether the converse is true. More interesting to me is the upper bound. There seems to be no upper bound to $S_n$ , but it grows very slowly.

For instance, that $$a \bmod b = a - b\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor .$$ There are several ways to do it by (ab)using various functions like ceiling, max, abs, and the like. However, I realized yesterday that $$a \bmod 2 = \frac{1-(-1)^a}{2}.$$ I find this interesting as I consider basic exponentiation to be a purer operation in some sense than something like floor, perhaps in that it doesn't have a built-in sense of conditionality or knowledge of fractional parts. Furthermore, you can use substitution to reach arbitrarily high powers of $2$ , as in $$a \bmod 4 = \frac{1-(-1)^a}{2}+1-(-1)^{\frac{a-\frac{1-(-1)^a}{2}}{2}},$$ which amounts to right-shifting $a$ by one spot and repeating the process to get the second bit you need for the $\bmod 4$ . I realize that's not pretty, but I'm interested that it's possible. The motivation here is identifying situations where formulae may implicitly support a richness of computational complexity one wouldn't expect, which parity detection and manipulation goes a long way towards.
