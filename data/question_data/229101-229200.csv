Let $(X,\succsim)$ be a preordered set, and define $\mathcal{L}(\succsim)$ as the set of all complete preorders that extend $\succsim$. Define $\dim(X,\succsim)$ as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\succsim = R_1 \cap \cdots \cap R_k$ for some $R_i \in \mathcal{L}(\succsim)$, with $i=1,\cdots,k$. Show that $\dim(X,\succsim)\leq|X^2|$. In order to attack the problem, first of all I took a look at $\dim(X,X^2)$ and $\dim(X,\Delta_X)$, where $\Delta_X$ is the diagonal relation. In this question I got a feedback on my conclusions: indeed $\dim(X,X^2)=1$ and $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$. The interesting case is $\dim(X,\Delta_X)$, because this is the one that gave me a bit of intuition on how to attack the problem that I present now. Given a $\Delta_X$, we have that $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$, because we can imagine all the elements of the diagonal relation (let's call them $x_1,\cdots,x_n$) separated. I literally imagine $n$ loops, one for each element, that are all unrelated. This is a preorder. In order to make it a complete preorder we start to connect them. Now, we can have in the family of complete preorders that extend the original preorder two complete preorders: - one in which all the arrows move from $x_1$ to $x_n$, - and another in which the arrows move in the opposite direction. Here, the direction of the arrows is not such a big problem, so it is without loss of generality. Interestingly, if we intersect those two complete preorders we come up with the original preorder. Thus, $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$. Focusing now on the original problem of $\dim(X,\succsim)\leq|X^2|$, I think that I have two problems: 1) I am not sure what the question is really about. Indeed, I think that - stricly speaking - the question is all about proving the (probably) trivial result that in principle $\dim(X,\succsim)$ cannot be bigger than $|X^2|$. So we should prove it by contradiction, coming up with the fact that $|X^2|$ represents the biggest possible numbers of connection we can have on a finite set. [Not sure, if I expressed this idea properly, so feel free to correct me] However, another possible way of looking as this problem is that what we really have to prove is that $|X^2|$ is the upper bound of $\dim(X,\succsim)$. And here, part of my problems get serious... 2) ...because I cannot see how it can be that $\dim(X,\succsim)>2$. This is the case even if I found myself downloading most of the papers written on the topic during the last fifty years (yep, I am kinda perfectionist, so when I do not understand, I find myself trying to read every possible paper on a topic... this is the case also because I am basically self-taught). So, the point here is that I cannot see how $\dim(X,\succsim)>2$, because I can apply the procedure I used to come up with $\dim(X,\Delta_X)=2$ basically always. In other words, I can always find a relation that completes another with some arrows, and another that completes the very same relation with arrows of the opposite direction, coming up with the intersection of the two complete relation equal to the original incomplete relation. In the end, sorry for this long post, for a probably easy question. I guess that some of my problems can be related to my idea of extension of a preorder or a poset. Anyway, I am positive about the fact that with your help I will find what my problems are all about. Looking forward to any feedback. Thanks in advance. PS: I add the tag of ""Graph Theory"", because I tried to use a lot of that kind of intuition to figure out what the problem is all about, and I am sure that having a feedback from that point of view on this issue can be really helpful (both from a pedagogical and theoretical perspective). Edit: I added the following picture in order to show what is the problem I still have, beyond kind and comprehensive Brian M.Scott's answer. Let's say this is an Hasse diagram of a poset, so let's try to focus on the dimension of posets instead of preorders, like in my original problem. In order to make this poset complete (so, to come up with a linear extension of it) I can add a connection that moves from $b$ to $c$ ($bRc$) and another from $a$ to $c$ ($aRc$). Let's call this linear extension $R_1$. Now, let's come up with a new linear extension that moves from the same Hasse diagram, but that has connections that move in the opposite directions (which means that we have $cRa$ and $cRb$). Let's call this new linear extension $R_2$. If we intersect the two linear extension we built up, the result is the original poset.

58,Is mathematics done in an arbitrary model of ZFC?,Is mathematics done in an arbitrary model of ZFC?,,"Following up a previous thread I posted, I have tried to refine my questions. I would be happy with answers simply confirming that I have understood matters correctly, but of course I would also be happy to read longer and more elaborate answers! Suppose I want ZFC (as formulated in first-order logic) to be my foundations of mathematics, i.e. I want it to be possible to formalise all of my reasoning about for example number theory as consequences in first-order logic of the ZFC axioms. These are my questions: When I consider a ""set"", for example $\mathbb{N}$, when doing mathematics, is it reasonable to view $\mathbb{N}$ as living in a fixed model of ZFC? So if I wanted to be very pedantic, I would refer to $\mathbb{N}$ as $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is my fixed model of ZFC? Suppose I am doing mathematics and discussing properties of $\mathbb{N}$ with a friend of mine. Can any ""problems"" arise from me (implicitly) thinking of $\mathbb{N}$ as being $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ living in my ZFC-model $\mathcal{A}$, while my friend thinks of $\mathbb{N}$ as being  $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{B}$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is his ZFC-model? I suppose since all assumptions we have made about $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is that they are ZFC-models, no ""substantial"" problems can arise, so my friend and I can therefore safely agree to ease notation by referring to $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{B}$ as simply $\mathbb{N}$? Given that my understanding of the above questions is correct, it seems reasonable to view mathematics in a ""semantic"" way as ""being done in an arbitrary model of ZFC""? Alternatively, if I insist on first-order logic ZFC to be my foundations, I could view doing mathematics as a sort of informal natural deduction, i.e. I could have a ""syntactic"" view on mathematics. The soundness and completeness theorems ensure that the ""semantic"" and ""syntactic"" views in some sense are the same, but perhaps one of the approaches has some philosophical advantages? I obviously find the semantic view more pleasing, since the semantic view is ""consistent"" with my view of a sets as living in models of ZFC... Thanks in advance! Edit: I realise that perhaps ""the standard model of ZFC"" might be relevant to my questions. That is, I should perhaps view $\mathbb{N}$ as always referring specifically to $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{S}$ where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the standard model of ZFC? Similarly, I should perhaps also view mathematics as being done specifically in the standard model of ZFC. If we disregard problems with even defining which model of ZFC is the standard one, this view also seems to give us problems with translating our informal mathematical proofs to natural deduction: If mathematics is done in a very specific model of ZFC, we can no longer rely on completeness of first-order logic to guarantee existence of a derivation in natural deduction. To summarise my edit: If the standard model of ZFC is relevant to my questions, please illuminate how. I do not think the standard model is relevant for my questions in any other way than being an ""intuitive model"" when thinking of ZFC.","Following up a previous thread I posted, I have tried to refine my questions.

So if I wanted to be very pedantic, I would refer to $\mathbb{N}$ as $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is my fixed model of ZFC? Suppose I am doing mathematics and discussing properties of $\mathbb{N}$ with a friend of mine. Can any ""problems"" arise from me (implicitly) thinking of $\mathbb{N}$ as being $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ living in my ZFC-model $\mathcal{A}$, while my friend thinks of $\mathbb{N}$ as being  $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{B}$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is his ZFC-model? I suppose since all assumptions we have made about $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is that they are ZFC-models, no ""substantial"" problems can arise, so my friend and I can therefore safely agree to ease notation by referring to $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{B}$ as simply $\mathbb{N}$? Given that my understanding of the above questions is correct, it seems reasonable to view mathematics in a ""semantic"" way as ""being done in an arbitrary model of ZFC""? Alternatively, if I insist on first-order logic ZFC to be my foundations, I could view doing mathematics as a sort of informal natural deduction, i.e. I could have a ""syntactic"" view on mathematics. The soundness and completeness theorems ensure that the ""semantic"" and ""syntactic"" views in some sense are the same, but perhaps one of the approaches has some philosophical advantages? I obviously find the semantic view more pleasing, since the semantic view is ""consistent"" with my view of a sets as living in models of ZFC... Thanks in advance! Edit: I realise that perhaps ""the standard model of ZFC"" might be relevant to my questions. That is, I should perhaps view $\mathbb{N}$ as always referring specifically to $\mathbb{N}^\mathcal{S}$ where $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the standard model of ZFC? Similarly, I should perhaps also view mathematics as being done specifically in the standard model of ZFC. If we disregard problems with even defining which model of ZFC is the standard one, this view also seems to give us problems with translating our informal mathematical proofs to natural deduction: If mathematics is done in a very specific model of ZFC, we can no longer rely on completeness of first-order logic to guarantee existence of a derivation in natural deduction. To summarise my edit: If the standard model of ZFC is relevant to my questions, please illuminate how. I do not think the standard model is relevant for my questions in any other way than being an ""intuitive model"" when thinking of ZFC.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'philosophy', 'foundations']"

EDIT: I have reformulated my question as largely a request for people to comment on or critique my attempt at ""a more fleshed out inductive proof."" Since the proof is by induction, I'll try to outline my thoughts according to the typical way an induction proof works. Any comments as to where I am going wrong or what needs to be fixed would be greatly appreciated. Proof attempt: Base case: The procedure gives a single value to $a_0$ , namely $c$ . My understanding is that we basically assume a natural number $c$ exists due to Assumption 2.6, and we simply make the definition $a_0\colon=c$ . None of the other definitions $a_{n++}\colon=f_n(a_n)$ will redefine the value of $a_0$ because the way in which a natural number $a_n$ is assigned to another natural number $n$ is by the assignment $a_{n++}\colon=f_n(a_n)$ which involves the successor, and Axiom 2.3 tells us that $n++\neq0$ for every natural number $n$ . Hence, it's impossible to define (again) $a_0$ once the procedure has begun. Inductive step: Suppose inductively that the procedure gives a single value to $a_n$ . We want to show that a single value is then given to $a_{n++}$ , namely $a_{n++}\colon=f_n(a_n)$ . We should first note that $a_n$ being single-valued is critical because $a_{n++}$ is going to be defined to be $a_{n++}\colon=f_n(a_n)$ , and it would not be sensible to start thinking about $a_{n++}$ being single-valued if $a_{n++}$ were defined in terms of a function whose argument was multi-valued (i.e., if $a_n$ were multi-valued, then we could reasonably expect $f_n(a_n)$ to return multiple distinct values as well). It may seem as though we can now safely rely on $a_{n++}$ being single-valued, but there is a concern we must address, namely the possibility that for a later natural number $m$ the corresponding definition $a_{m++}\colon=f_m(a_m)$ could somehow cause $a_{n++}$ to be multi-valued. How? If we came across an $m$ for which $n++=m++$ but $f_n(a_n)\neq f_m(a_m)$ , then we would have an issue  because $n++=m++$ implies that $a_{n++}=a_{m++}$ . Why would this be a problem? Well, with $a_{n++}\colon= f_n(a_n)$ and $a_{m++}\colon= f_m(a_m)$ , we would have $a_{n++}=f_n(a_n),f_m(a_m)$ even though $f_n(a_n)\neq f_m(a_m)$ , indicating that $a_{++}$ would not have a single value assigned to it, as desired. How do we resolve this potential issue? Suppose that later in the process we came across an $m$ corresponding to the definition $a_{m++}\colon= f_m(a_m)$ , where we also had $n++=m++$ . Since $n++=m++$ , it must be the case that $n=m$ by Axiom 2.4. Hence, we must also have $f_n(a_n)=f_m(a_m)$ , thus showing that none of the other definitions $a_{m++}\colon= f_m(a_m)$ will redefine the value of $a_{n++}$ , and hence only a single value is assigned to $a_{n++}$ . This completes the induction, and so $a_n$ is defined for each natural number $n$ , with a single value assigned to each $a_n$ . Content by Tao: Axiom 2.1. $0$ is a natural number. Axiom 2.2. If $n$ is a natural number, then $n{++}$ is also a natural number. Axiom 2.3. $0$ is not the successor of any natural number ; i.e., we have $n{++} \ne 0$ for every natural number $n$ . Axiom 2.4.

Let me give the build-up to the exercise and the exercise itself. I transpose the commutative diagrams to symbolic expressions due to the apparently limited nature of MathJax in expressing them. Lawvere defines a part of a set to be a monomap with codomain equal to the set. He also defines $f \in i$ for map f and part i with common codomain to mean there exists another map $k$ such that $f = ik$. Given an arbitrary map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ and an arbitrary part $V \xrightarrow{j} Y$ of the codomain, there is a part $U \xrightarrow{i} X$ of the domain such that (0) for all $T \xrightarrow{x} X$ $$x \in i \Leftrightarrow fx \in j.$$ This implies (1) there is a commutative square $j\bar{f} = fi$, moreover (2) whenever $fx = j\bar{y}$ is another commutative square, for some $T \xrightarrow{x} X$ and $T \xrightarrow{\bar{y}} V$, there is an $T \xrightarrow{\bar{x}} U$ such that $x = i\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y} = \bar{f}\bar{x}$, and lastly (3) $\bar{x}$ is unique (because we have assumed $i$ is a monomapping).

(0) $\Rightarrow$ (2): Consider such $x, \bar{y}$. Then $fx \in j$, implying by $(0)$ that $x \in i$, which means there is an $\bar{x}$ such that $x = i\bar{x}$. The original commutative square states $fi = j\bar{f}$, implying $j\bar{f}\bar{x} = fi\bar{x} = fx = j\bar{y}$. Since $j$ is mono we find $\bar{y} = \bar{f}\bar{x}$. (0) $\Rightarrow$ (3): Consider $\bar{x}'$, then $i\bar{x} = x = i\bar{x}'$. We have $\bar{x} = \bar{x}'$ since $i$ is mono. I've also ""solved"" c, but without requiring (3) as an assumption. So my question is 'where's the flaw?', since I doubt that (1) and (2) imply (3). Here's my argument: Consider an arbitrary $T \xrightarrow{x} X$.

97,The recursion principle.,The recursion principle.,,"In the book that I read there is a exercise where we need to prove the recursion principle that is written in the next fashion. Proposition : Let $f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function and $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, there exist a unique function $ a: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that: $a(0):=c\: $ and  $\:a(n^{+}):=f(n,a(n))$; (where $n^{+}:=n \cup \left\{n \right\} $). The book give us a hint: Show that for each natural number there exist a n-function $ a_{n}: n^{+}\rightarrow \mathbb{N} $ such that $a_{n}(0):=c\: $ and for each $ i \in n$, $\:a_{n}(i^{+}):=f(i,a(i))$. And here is what I have at this moment: Claim 1 : For each natural number there exist a n-function. Proof of Claim 1: Let  ""$\varphi (x)$"" be the following: $ \forall x \forall y \forall y' ( \langle x,y\rangle  \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y'\rangle  \in a_{n} \rightarrow y=y' ) \wedge Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} \wedge a_{n} (0)= c \,\wedge \,  \forall i (i \in n \rightarrow a_{n} (i^{+}) = f(\,i,a_{n} (i))\,). $ Now we can apply the separation axiom and form a set which we define as: $ S : = \left\{n \in \mathbb{N}: \exists a_{n} \varphi (x) \right\} $ For n=0, we require a function with domain $ 0^{+} $. And as the only element of the domain is $ 0 $, we can form the ordered pair $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\}. $ Which is a function, its domain is in fact $n^{+}$ and the last statement of the formula is vacously true. Then $ 0 \in S$. Suppose $ n\in S $ that means $ a_{n} $ exist. Then, we define  $ a_{n^{+}} $ as follows: $ a_{n^{+}}: = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$. So, only we need to show that  $ a_{n^{+}} $ is a n+1- function. i) $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n^{+}} \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in  a_{n} \vee  \langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ As $ a_{n}$ is a function by our inductive hypothesis, only we need to show that $ \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} $ is a functional relation: $\langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \rightarrow y = f(n,a_{n} (n) = y'$. It follows because f is indeed a function. ii) $ Dom (a_{n^{+}}) = Dom(a_{n}) \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} $.  By hypothesis we know that $ Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} $. Hence  $  n^{+} \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} = n^{++}$. iii) As $a_{n}\subset a_{n ^ {+}} $, and by hypothesis we know that $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n} $. Then  $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} $. iv) $\forall i \in n^{+}. \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} \leftrightarrow \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} \vee \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}  $. If $ \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} $ by hypothesis we know that  $ c = f(i, a_{n}(i)) $ as desired. On the other hand if $\langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ it follows by construction. Then $ n^{+} \in S $, and we conclude by induction that, there exist a n-function for every natural number. Claim 2 : For each natural number this function is unique. Proof of claim 2:  For n = 0, the only 0-function is $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\} $. If we assume that holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. Let $ a_n = a'_n $, for construction of n-functions we know that: $ a_{n^{+}} = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a'_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n^{+}} $. Therefore all the n-functions are uniques. At this point  I'm not sure how could I derive exactly the  function    a, I think that maybe using the union of all the families  $ a_{n} $.   But I'm not really sure, somebody knows? I'm not sure here, but if we use the replacement axiom for each n-function we have: Let ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" be the formula: $  ( x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = \,x-function ) \vee (\neg x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = 0 ) $. For the claim 2 there exist a unique n-function for each n, therefore ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" is functional. And we can apply replacement to derive: $\left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$. And (maybe) define the function $a$  to be: $a: = \bigcup \left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$ Here is my attempt: By the union axiom and the replacement schema axiom $a$ defined as above is a set. So, only we need to show that indeed is a function and that all property that we wish really holds. Claim 3 : The relation a is a functional relation. Proof of Claim  3: To $a$ be a functional relation we need to show $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a \wedge  \langle x,y' \rangle \in a \rightarrow y = y'.$ if $\langle x,y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} $ at the same way $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists m \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m}. $ And as $ m \in n \vee n\in m  \vee n = m$. (1) If $n = m$, by claim 2 we have that $ a_{n} = a_{m}$ and as $ a_{n} $ is functional. We're done, that means $ y = y'$ because  $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow y = y'$. (2) If  $ m \in n\, (m < n)$  by construction we know that $ a_{m} \subset a_{n}$. Then $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} \rightarrow \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $  and as $a_{n}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. (3) At the same way if  $ n \in m\, (n < m),\, a_{n} \subset a_{m}$. Then $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} $  and as $a_{m}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. Then $a$ is a functional relation. Claim 4 : The functional relation a, is a function such that $ a(0) = c \wedge a (i^{+}) = f(i, a(i))$. Proof of claim 4: (1) As definition all the n-function evaluated at 0 are c, therefore the union of all of them is c, $ \langle 0,c \rangle \in a $ as desired. (2) If  $i^{+} \in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n\in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a_{n}. $ By construction of all the n-function that means $ y = f(i, a_{n} (i))$. So, only we need to show that $ a_{n} (i) = a (i) $. But since $ a_{n} $ is the restriction of $a$ at n, that follows inmediately. What do you think? Is it correct? The other exercise the book says this: Show using the last proposition there exist only one version of the natural numbers in set theory. My attempt: Let $ \mathbb{N'}$ be a set such that the Peano's axioms hold. Let f be a function, $f : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N'} \rightarrow  \mathbb{N'} $, such that $ \langle n,n' \rangle \mapsto n'^{+}$. And, $ a: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N'}$ such that, $a(0) = 0'$ and $ a(n^{+}) = f(n, a(n)) = n'^{+} =(a(n))^{+} $. By the last proposition the function exist and it is unique. Injective part: For $n = 0$ we have $ a (0) = a(0^{*}) = 0'$, so we need to show that $0 = 0^{*}$. By the sake of the contradiction suppose $0 \neq 0^{*}$. Therefore $ 0^{*} = k^{+} $ for some $k \in \mathbb{N},\, a(0^{*})=a(k^{+}) = k'^{+}$. And as the Peano's Axiom hold in $\mathbb{N'}, k'^{+} \neq 0'$, a contradiction. Then, $ 0=0^{*} $. Suppose that our assumption holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. If $ n'^{+}=a (n^{+}) = a (n^{*+})=n'^{*+}$. By the Peano's axioms we have $ n'^{+} = n'^{*+} \rightarrow  n'= n'^{*}$. As $a(n)=n' = a(n^{*})=n'^{*},\; a(n) = a(n^{*}) \rightarrow n = n^{*} $ (by the inductive hypothesis). Hence $ n^{+} = n^{*+}$. That closed the induction. Surjective part: By definition we know that $0' = a (0)$, so there exist a $0 \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that our assumption holds for n', that means $ n' = a(n)$ there exist a $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So, $ n' ^{+}=(n')^{+} = (a(n))^{+} = a(n^{+})$. That closed the induction. Hence exist a bijection between them.

Proof of Claim 1: Let  ""$\varphi (x)$"" be the following: $ \forall x \forall y \forall y' ( \langle x,y\rangle  \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y'\rangle  \in a_{n} \rightarrow y=y' ) \wedge Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} \wedge a_{n} (0)= c \,\wedge \,  \forall i (i \in n \rightarrow a_{n} (i^{+}) = f(\,i,a_{n} (i))\,). $ Now we can apply the separation axiom and form a set which we define as: $ S : = \left\{n \in \mathbb{N}: \exists a_{n} \varphi (x) \right\} $ For n=0, we require a function with domain $ 0^{+} $. And as the only element of the domain is $ 0 $, we can form the ordered pair $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\}. $ Which is a function, its domain is in fact $n^{+}$ and the last statement of the formula is vacously true. Then $ 0 \in S$. Suppose $ n\in S $ that means $ a_{n} $ exist. Then, we define  $ a_{n^{+}} $ as follows: $ a_{n^{+}}: = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$. So, only we need to show that  $ a_{n^{+}} $ is a n+1- function. i) $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n^{+}} \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in  a_{n} \vee  \langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ As $ a_{n}$ is a function by our inductive hypothesis, only we need to show that $ \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} $ is a functional relation: $\langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \rightarrow y = f(n,a_{n} (n) = y'$. It follows because f is indeed a function. ii) $ Dom (a_{n^{+}}) = Dom(a_{n}) \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} $.  By hypothesis we know that $ Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} $. Hence  $  n^{+} \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} = n^{++}$. iii) As $a_{n}\subset a_{n ^ {+}} $, and by hypothesis we know that $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n} $. Then  $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} $. iv) $\forall i \in n^{+}. \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} \leftrightarrow \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} \vee \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}  $. If $ \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} $ by hypothesis we know that  $ c = f(i, a_{n}(i)) $ as desired. On the other hand if $\langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ it follows by construction. Then $ n^{+} \in S $, and we conclude by induction that, there exist a n-function for every natural number. Claim 2 : For each natural number this function is unique. Proof of claim 2:  For n = 0, the only 0-function is $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\} $. If we assume that holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. Let $ a_n = a'_n $, for construction of n-functions we know that: $ a_{n^{+}} = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a'_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n^{+}} $. Therefore all the n-functions are uniques. At this point  I'm not sure how could I derive exactly the  function    a, I think that maybe using the union of all the families  $ a_{n} $.   But I'm not really sure, somebody knows? I'm not sure here, but if we use the replacement axiom for each n-function we have: Let ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" be the formula: $  ( x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = \,x-function ) \vee (\neg x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = 0 ) $. For the claim 2 there exist a unique n-function for each n, therefore ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" is functional. And we can apply replacement to derive: $\left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$. And (maybe) define the function $a$  to be: $a: = \bigcup \left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$ Here is my attempt: By the union axiom and the replacement schema axiom $a$ defined as above is a set. So, only we need to show that indeed is a function and that all property that we wish really holds. Claim 3 : The relation a is a functional relation. Proof of Claim  3: To $a$ be a functional relation we need to show $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a \wedge  \langle x,y' \rangle \in a \rightarrow y = y'.$ if $\langle x,y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} $ at the same way $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists m \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m}. $ And as $ m \in n \vee n\in m  \vee n = m$. (1) If $n = m$, by claim 2 we have that $ a_{n} = a_{m}$ and as $ a_{n} $ is functional. We're done, that means $ y = y'$ because  $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow y = y'$. (2) If  $ m \in n\, (m < n)$  by construction we know that $ a_{m} \subset a_{n}$. Then $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} \rightarrow \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $  and as $a_{n}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. (3) At the same way if  $ n \in m\, (n < m),\, a_{n} \subset a_{m}$. Then $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} $  and as $a_{m}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. Then $a$ is a functional relation. Claim 4 : The functional relation a, is a function such that $ a(0) = c \wedge a (i^{+}) = f(i, a(i))$. Proof of claim 4: (1) As definition all the n-function evaluated at 0 are c, therefore the union of all of them is c, $ \langle 0,c \rangle \in a $ as desired. (2) If  $i^{+} \in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n\in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a_{n}. $ By construction of all the n-function that means $ y = f(i, a_{n} (i))$. So, only we need to show that $ a_{n} (i) = a (i) $. But since $ a_{n} $ is the restriction of $a$ at n, that follows inmediately. What do you think? Is it correct? The other exercise the book says this: Show using the last proposition there exist only one version of the natural numbers in set theory. My attempt: Let $ \mathbb{N'}$ be a set such that the Peano's axioms hold. Let f be a function, $f : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N'} \rightarrow  \mathbb{N'} $, such that $ \langle n,n' \rangle \mapsto n'^{+}$. And, $ a: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N'}$ such that, $a(0) = 0'$ and $ a(n^{+}) = f(n, a(n)) = n'^{+} =(a(n))^{+} $. By the last proposition the function exist and it is unique. Injective part: For $n = 0$ we have $ a (0) = a(0^{*}) = 0'$, so we need to show that $0 = 0^{*}$. By the sake of the contradiction suppose $0 \neq 0^{*}$. Therefore $ 0^{*} = k^{+} $ for some $k \in \mathbb{N},\, a(0^{*})=a(k^{+}) = k'^{+}$. And as the Peano's Axiom hold in $\mathbb{N'}, k'^{+} \neq 0'$, a contradiction. Then, $ 0=0^{*} $. Suppose that our assumption holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. If $ n'^{+}=a (n^{+}) = a (n^{*+})=n'^{*+}$. By the Peano's axioms we have $ n'^{+} = n'^{*+} \rightarrow  n'= n'^{*}$. As $a(n)=n' = a(n^{*})=n'^{*},\; a(n) = a(n^{*}) \rightarrow n = n^{*} $ (by the inductive hypothesis). Hence $ n^{+} = n^{*+}$. That closed the induction. Surjective part: By definition we know that $0' = a (0)$, so there exist a $0 \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that our assumption holds for n', that means $ n' = a(n)$ there exist a $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So, $ n' ^{+}=(n')^{+} = (a(n))^{+} = a(n^{+})$. That closed the induction. Hence exist a bijection between them. Any suggestion about all of these exercises....",,['elementary-set-theory']
