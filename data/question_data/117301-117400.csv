9,Why not define lines in a metric space using a locus?,Why not define lines in a metric space using a locus?,,"If we want to talk about geometry in a metric space, we go through the following procedure to define geodesics. We define the length of a path in the (complete) space as the length given by integrating over infinitesimal distances on the path. The intrinsic metric of the space is then given by the infimum of the lengths of all paths between two points. If the intrinsic metric agrees with the metric we call the space a 'length space'; If furthermore there is a unique path between any two points whose length is the same as the distance between the points, we call that path the geodesic between the two points. We can from here go on and talk about geometry. The above definition uses that property of straight lines in the euclidean plane, that they are the shortest paths between two points, to generalize to abitrary metric spaces. This is fine and also nicely connects with the usual definition of geodesics in Riemannian geometry, however it's only applicable in a restricted class of metric spaces (length spaces with unique geodesics), and seems to rely on further analytic properties instead of propeties related only to the metric itself.

16,The Velocities of the Contact Points of Two Rolling Curves are Equal at the Instant of Contact,The Velocities of the Contact Points of Two Rolling Curves are Equal at the Instant of Contact,,"Consider two 2-Dimensional rigid bodies surrounded by two planar smooth curves. Suppose that the two bodies are in the same plane and in contact with each other such that they are rolling with respect to each other. To demonstrate the meaning of rolling , suppose that the points $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the figure below are the contact points at the present time and the points $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the points that will be in contact after some time. Then the rolling condition is defined as $s_1=s_2$. So our definition of rolling is Definition . Two smooth curves are said to be rolling with respect to each other if the length of their contacted portions during a time interval is equal. Now, the main question is to prove the following theorem Theorem . Two smooth curves are rolling with respect to each other if and only if the velocity vectors of the contact points are equal to each other at the instant of contact. So the theorem is expressing an equivalent condition for rolling . Simple versions of the theorem are rolling of a circle over a straight line , inclined line, another circle, ellipse or parabola (See the animation below). Taking a look at the links will help you to visualize better. Without loss of generality you can assume that curve $2$ is still and curve $1$ is rolling on it. This is a well-known theorem that is taught to mechanical engineering students in a Machine Dynamics course without a proof! I was not able to find the proof anywhere in the engineering, physical or mathematical texts. I would be happy to see a full detailed answer but I do not expect one. Also, I have not defined the problem rigorously so if you see flaws you can modify it as you wish. But I think you can imagine what I mean by the examples and links I provided.

Show that if the two flag poles are of different heights he will march in a circle. To celebrate the King's birthday a third flagpole is added. Soldiers are then assigned to each of the three different pairs of flagpoles and are told to march in such a way that they always keep the tops of their two assigned flagpoles at equal angles of elevation to one another. Show that, if the three flagpoles have different heights $h_1, h_2$ and $h_3$ and the circles in which the soldiers march have centres at $(x_{ij},y_{ij})$ (for the flagpoles of height $h_i$ and $h_j$ ) relative to Cartesian coordinates fixed in the parade ground, then $x_{ij}$ satisfy $$h_3^2(h_1^2-h_2^2)x_{12}+h_1^2(h_2^2-h_3^2)x_{23}+h_2^2(h_3^2-h_1^2)x_{31}=0.$$ Deduce that the three centres lie in a straight line.

Let the line joining $F, J$ meet $AD$ at $K$. We will prove that $K$ is the midpoint of $DA$. Joining $KG, GF, FE, EK$, it quickly becomes clear that the above is only true if $KGFE$ is a parallelogram, which in turn, is only true if $EJ = JG, KJ = JF$. Proving the first equality is easy. In $\Delta ABC, EH || BC, 2\cdot EH = BC$. Likewise, in $\Delta DBC, IG || BC, 2\cdot IG = BC$. Therefore, $IG||EH, IG=EH$. Therefore, $EHGI$ is a parallelogram and $EJ = JG$. Even after numerous efforts I wasn't able to prove the second equality. I noticed that this was because I was not utilizing the fact that $F$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and that $FK$ is the straight line. So, to utilize those facts, I considered $\Delta HKJ, \Delta JFI$. Proving these are congruent will prove our conjecture. Now, we can use the fact that $FK$ is a straight line by saying, that $\angle HJK = \angle IJF$. Also, since $EHGI$ is a parallelogram, $HJ = JI$. Now we need only one more equivalence to prove congruency. I wasn't able to find this. A way to utilize the fact that $F$ is the midpoint of $BC$ is by noticing that $EHCF, IGFC, AHFE, FIDG$ are all parallelograms. I have, however, no idea how to use these in the proof.

It seems pretty obvious to me that this should always be possible, but how would one prove it? This question came up while I was cutting slices of garlic bread with a knife.  I cut two pieces at a time to speed up the process.  I have to cut the pieces almost exactly in half so my kids won't argue about who got the most.  :-)",,['geometry']

If I'm adding up solid angles $A$ and $B$ , I can't just draw the second angle $B$ so that it starts from the endpoint of $A$ , as I could if it was in 2 Dimensions, because solid angles don't have a single endpoint. So, how would I be able to picture 2 adjacent solid angles? Or 3 adjacent solid angles? Or does the idea of adjacency just not exist when we're considering solid angles? The reason I'm asking is because I'm working on a proof that involves n arbitrary shape with a point somewhere within it.

93,On the translation between a morphism of schemes and its geometric description,On the translation between a morphism of schemes and its geometric description,,"Within the theory of schemes, rather than formally defining a morphism of schemes (saying which prime goes to which, and what the pullback map looks like), we often give the geometric intuition behind it. I am having difficulties translating between these two perspectives. Easier example. Let's work in $\mathbb{R}$. I want to formalize what 'the projection of the parabola $y = x^2$ to the $y$-axis' means. Within the world of schemes, I guess that means you want a morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,y] / (y - x^2)$ to $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[y]$. Which one? It suffices to pick the right ring map $\mathbb{R}[y] \to \mathbb{R}[x,y] / (y-x^2)$. The obvious choice would be the inclusion map, so that's going to be what you want. To be honest the only reason I 'get' this is because this is the only reasonable choice. Harder example. Consider the circle of radius $1$ around the origin. We want to find rational points on this circle. One of them is the point $p = (1,0)$. If $q$ is another rational point, consider the line going through $p$ and $q$, and compute the slope of this line. We end up with a map taking the coordinates $q = (x,y)$ and sending it to the slope $y/(x-1)$. Somehow this should yield a rational map from the circle to the affine line, i.e. a map $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Q}[x,y] / (x^2 + y^2 - 1) \dashrightarrow \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}^1$. Which rational map should it be? It beats me. Intuitively I understand what the map should do. I also understand that the formula we described gives the behaviour on closed points. But I'm not able to translate the intuition to a full fledged rational map. Question. What should the map be in the harder example? What I tried. The problem that I'm facing is that we are looking for a rational map, and not a morphism, so we cannot consider a corresponding map of rings. In this case, we're lucky that the birational 'inverse' of this map is an actual morphism, and this morphism should correspond to a ring map $\mathbb{Q}[x,y] / (x^2 + y^2 - 1) \to \mathbb{Q}[z]$. I can't think of a reasonable choice. One might also try and define the desired rational map on small affines and patch them together but this seems more tedious, and I end up getting stuck with the same problem. Follow-up question. What is the general procedure for going from a geometric description to an actual morphism, and how do we know when   it suffices to describe the behaviour on the closed points? Edit. I would also be very happy with a reference. Unfortunately no book I know of seems to refer to this 'bridge'. Vakil formally defines morphisms of schemes but then proceeds to give 'examples' of morphisms of schemes by just providing coordinate maps.* Hartshorne and Mumford give examples in the world of varieties (where coordinate maps are fine because you only have the closed points to deal with) but forget about them when moving to schemes.

I quote: ""Suppose you are looking for rational points on the circle $C$ given by $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. One rational point is $p = (1,0)$. If $q$ is another rational point, then $pq$ is a line of rational (non-infinite) slope.

"" But he doesn't say what this 'something subtle' is supposed to be, and that's precisely the detail that I've been desperately looking for for a long time. What is it?","Within the theory of schemes, rather than formally defining a morphism of schemes (saying which prime goes to which, and what the pullback map looks like), we often give the geometric intuition behind it. I am having difficulties translating between these two perspectives. Easier example. Let's work in $\mathbb{R}$. I want to formalize what 'the projection of the parabola $y = x^2$ to the $y$-axis' means. Within the world of schemes, I guess that means you want a morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,y] / (y - x^2)$ to $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[y]$. Which one? It suffices to pick the right ring map $\mathbb{R}[y] \to \mathbb{R}[x,y] / (y-x^2)$. The obvious choice would be the inclusion map, so that's going to be what you want. To be honest the only reason I 'get' this is because this is the only reasonable choice. Harder example. Consider the circle of radius $1$ around the origin. We want to find rational points on this circle. One of them is the point $p = (1,0)$. If $q$ is another rational point, consider the line going through $p$ and $q$, and compute the slope of this line. We end up with a map taking the coordinates $q = (x,y)$ and sending it to the slope $y/(x-1)$. Somehow this should yield a rational map from the circle to the affine line, i.e. a map $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Q}[x,y] / (x^2 + y^2 - 1) \dashrightarrow \mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}^1$. Which rational map should it be? It beats me. Intuitively I understand what the map should do. I also understand that the formula we described gives the behaviour on closed points. But I'm not able to translate the intuition to a full fledged rational map. Question. What should the map be in the harder example? What I tried. The problem that I'm facing is that we are looking for a rational map, and not a morphism, so we cannot consider a corresponding map of rings. In this case, we're lucky that the birational 'inverse' of this map is an actual morphism, and this morphism should correspond to a ring map $\mathbb{Q}[x,y] / (x^2 + y^2 - 1) \to \mathbb{Q}[z]$. I can't think of a reasonable choice. One might also try and define the desired rational map on small affines and patch them together but this seems more tedious, and I end up getting stuck with the same problem. Follow-up question. What is the general procedure for going from a geometric description to an actual morphism, and how do we know when   it suffices to describe the behaviour on the closed points? Edit. I would also be very happy with a reference. Unfortunately no book I know of seems to refer to this 'bridge'. Vakil formally defines morphisms of schemes but then proceeds to give 'examples' of morphisms of schemes by just providing coordinate maps.* Hartshorne and Mumford give examples in the world of varieties (where coordinate maps are fine because you only have the closed points to deal with) but forget about them when moving to schemes.
