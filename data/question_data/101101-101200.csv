1,uncountable number of Penrose tiling,uncountable number of Penrose tiling,,"I am interested in Penrose tiling, though I am not an expert, so I apologize in advance. It is known that that the number of different Penrose tilings is uncountable. This may be implied from de Bruijn method, of inducing these tilings from a cross section of a regular (cubic) tiling in 5 dimensions (But maybe I am mixing here between the two areas, since it is not clear for me from de Bruijn method if the size of the tiles themselves vary for each cross-section). However, in Martin Gardner's book “ Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor ciphers ” (or PDF of first two chpters ), the author describes a way of Conway to prove – in another way – that the number of different Penrose tilings is uncountable. However, this method is completely unclear for me. Here is the description of Gardner for Conway's method: Conway's proof of the uncountability of Penrose patterns (Penrose had earlier proved it in a different way) can be outlined as follows. On the kite label one side of the axis of symmetry $L$ , the other $R$ (for left and right). Do the same on the dart, using $l$ and $r$ . Now pick a random point on the tiling. Record the letter that gives its location on the tile. Inflate the pattern one step, note the location of the same point in a second-generation tile and again record the letter. Continuing through higher inflations, you generate an infinite sequence of symbols that is a unique labeling of the original pattern seen, so to speak, from the selected point. […] Not all possible sequences of the four symbols can be produced this way, but those that label different patterns can be shown to corespond in number with the number of points on a line. How does this method induce a bijective function to the points on the line?","I am interested in Penrose tiling, though I am not an expert, so I apologize in advance.

3,Geometrical objects whose volumes are fractional powers of their sizes,Geometrical objects whose volumes are fractional powers of their sizes,,"While studying properties of foams (imagine bubbly soap or microscopical grids/networks), I started wondering on the relationship between the volume occupied by the matter $V_s$ itself and the overall volume $V_a$ of a given foam sample (matter+voids). Two lengths characterize these objects: the size of each pore $l_a$ and the thickness $l_s$ of the matter that encloses such a pore. You can picture a foam like a stack of cubes (the pores). When you suppose that each pore is fully closed by walls of matter, you obtain $V_s/V_a\propto l_s/l_a$. When you suppose that each pore is fully open, such that filaments are joined to each other and forming a sort of network, you obtain $V_s/V_a\propto (l_s/l_a)^2$. This is easy to picture, and comes naturally from the fact that basic geometrical shapes have a volume proportional to the powers of typical distances. Now, many foams exhibit $V_s/V_a\propto (l_s/l_a)^k$, where $k$ is fractional, between 1 and 2. This means that the volumes are not proportional to integer powers of the characteristic sizes in the problem. How is that possible? Is there a visual example of this situation?

6,What Is the Hardest Shape To Roll?,What Is the Hardest Shape To Roll?,,"I was having a discussion with a friend about rolling various shapes, in particular what shape is the worst at rolling.  I thought that a triangular wheel might be particularly bad at rolling while he suggested a thin rectangular wheel, approaching a plate, might be even worse as a wheel. We discussed this rather informally for a while, but we wanted to back it up with some maths, however we couldn't really think of a measure that captures the idea of ""How easily an wheel roll"".  So I thought I would ask some people that are better at maths.  What measure might be used to express the idea of being easy or hard to roll?  Is there any literature on rolling/wheel construction? To get it started a bit I'll cover all the ideas discussed between my friend and myself.  If these are unhelpful or off topic tell me and I'd be happy to edit them out. The only way we could think to measure how easy it is too roll was to put a shaped wheel on a flat surface with a very high coefficient of friction and tilt it until the wheel begins to roll. We would then take the angle as the measurement of roll-ability.  This seems pretty nice because it can be verified to some degree of accuracy empirically (however it seems quite difficult to get the conditions pristine enough that the shapes will roll rather than slide).  In addition circular wheels will begin to roll pretty much at angle 0, and everything will roll by the time the surface is vertical, this is pretty nice because it gives a finite range allowed.  The problem we saw with this is that it only measures the difficulty required to get the shape to begin to roll. For example in the plate idea suggested by my colleague takes quite a deal of effort to start up but once it begins to roll it will roll a half rotation quite easily because the thin edge is very unstable,  at the same time the triangular shape will probably take significantly less effort to start rolling, but once it moves it will only roll a 3rd of a rotation before returning to the start. An additional discussion we had was on what should be kept constant when comparing two shapes.  Our initial thought was to keep the cross sectional are of the wheels constant when comparing them, however as we thought about it more we thought it might be a good idea to compare shapes with equal perimeter , because shapes with larger perimeter tend to roll farther.  My friend pointed out however that concave shapes have perimeter that does not contribute to how far it rolls, we perhaps distance rolled per rotation would be a better measure.","I was having a discussion with a friend about rolling various shapes, in particular what shape is the worst at rolling.

8,The case of Captain America's shield: a variation of Alhazen's Billard problem,The case of Captain America's shield: a variation of Alhazen's Billard problem,,"I'm sure a lot of you are acquainted with Alhazen's Billiard problem, which involves finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a cue ball at a given point must be aimed in order to canon off the edge of the table and hit another ball at a second given point. While reading on this math problem, I thought of my favorite Marvel superhero, Captain America (Cap'). You may also know that Cap' has a special ability in which he is able to throw his shield in way so that it will ricochet off certain objects and return to him. Let's examine a scenario that places him in the context of the Billiard problem: Cap' is standing at point C in an empty circular room. ( Point C is not at the centre of the room , because if so he'd be able to throw the shield in any direction and have it bounce off the wall and return to him, since any trajectory would be the normal to the tangent at the point where the shield hits the wall. C is also not on the edge of the circle because that would lead to a trajectory based on inscribed polygons.) At point C , to have the shield return to him with 1 richochet, all Cap' needs to do is similarly throw the shield along the line of symmetry of the room that passes through C , so we'll constrain his aim to a point not on that line of symmetry, which means we'll be looking for 2 ricochets or more. These are the scenarios I'd like you all to consider: Where should Cap' aim to have the shield return to him in: 2 ricochets 3 ricochets 4 ricochets n ricochets? Edit : From the answers I've read and my own working, I believe there is a pattern for trajectories with either odd or even bounces. It would be nice if someone could algebraically find a generalized way to compute the coordinate of the ricochet point given the number of times we want the shield to bounce off the wall before returning. Note: For sake of mathematical analysis, let's assume the shield (a point mass) always moves in a straight line, does not lose kinetic energy and obeys the Law of reflection ( angle of incidence = angle of reflection. )","I'm sure a lot of you are acquainted with Alhazen's Billiard problem, which involves finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a cue ball at a given point must be aimed in order to canon off the edge of the table and hit another ball at a second given point.

28,Did Euclid really prove the existence of irrational numbers?,Did Euclid really prove the existence of irrational numbers?,,"In Proposition 10.10 of Euclid's Elements, Euclid tries to construct a line segment which is incommensurable with a given line segment.  (Two line segments are incommensurable if there exists no common line segment that both are integer multiples of, or equivalently, if the ratio of their lengths does not equal a ratio of natural numbers.) Here's what he says: Let A be the assigned straight line.  It is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with A. Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers , and let it be contrived that B is to C as the square on A is to the square on D, for we have learned how to do this.  Therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square on D.  And, since B does not have to C the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on A to the square on D the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore A is incommensurable in length with D. This proof relies on Euclid's Proposition 10.9 , which states in part that ""squares which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length either"".  So what Euclid does is he chooses two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers.  And then he constructs two squares whose areas are in the ratio of B to C.  And finally he uses Proposition 10.9 to show that the sides of the two squares are incommensurable. But my question is, where does Euclid get the fact that there exists two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers?  Euclid just says ""Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers"". For those who don't know, two natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are called similar plane numbers if there exist natural numbers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ such that $m=pq$, $n=rs$, and the ratio of $p$ to $q$ is equal to the ratio of $r$ to $s$, or equivalently the ratio of $p$ to $r$ is equal to the ratio of $q$ to $s$.  Now using Euclid's Proposition 8.18 and Proposition 8.11 , it's easy to prove that the ratio of similar plane numbers is equal to the ratio of square numbers.  But did Euclid ever prove the converse of that statement, i.e. that if two numbers are not similar plane numbers then their ratio is not equal to the ratio of square numbers? Because if Euclid didn't prove that, then he didn't really do the hard number theory work needed to prove that irrational numbers exist. EDIT: I just found out that Euclid stated the result I want him to prove in a Lemma after Proposition 10.9: It has been proved in the arithmetical books that similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and that, if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers. The translator says that the justification of this is ""VIII.26 and converse"".  Here is what Proposition 8.26 : Similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number. But where does Euclid prove the converse, namely that ""if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers""?  That's the hard thing to prove.  Euclid claims ""it has been proved in the arithmetical books"", i.e. in Books 7-9, but I can't seem to find such a proof.","In Proposition 10.10 of Euclid's Elements, Euclid tries to construct a line segment which is incommensurable with a given line segment.  (Two line segments are incommensurable if there exists no common line segment that both are integer multiples of, or equivalently, if the ratio of their lengths does not equal a ratio of natural numbers.) Here's what he says: Let A be the assigned straight line.  It is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with A. Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers , and let it be contrived that B is to C as the square on A is to the square on D, for we have learned how to do this.  Therefore the square on A is commensurable with the square on D.  And, since B does not have to C the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on A to the square on D the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore A is incommensurable in length with D. This proof relies on Euclid's Proposition 10.9 , which states in part that ""squares which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number also do not have their sides commensurable in length either"".  So what Euclid does is he chooses two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers.  And then he constructs two squares whose areas are in the ratio of B to C.  And finally he uses Proposition 10.9 to show that the sides of the two squares are incommensurable. But my question is, where does Euclid get the fact that there exists two natural numbers B and C such that the ratio of B to C is not equal to a ratio of square numbers?  Euclid just says ""Set out two numbers B and C which do not have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers"". For those who don't know, two natural numbers $m$ and $n$ are called similar plane numbers if there exist natural numbers $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ such that $m=pq$, $n=rs$, and the ratio of $p$ to $q$ is equal to the ratio of $r$ to $s$, or equivalently the ratio of $p$ to $r$ is equal to the ratio of $q$ to $s$.  Now using Euclid's Proposition 8.18 and Proposition 8.11 , it's easy to prove that the ratio of similar plane numbers is equal to the ratio of square numbers.  But did Euclid ever prove the converse of that statement, i.e. that if two numbers are not similar plane numbers then their ratio is not equal to the ratio of square numbers? Because if Euclid didn't prove that, then he didn't really do the hard number theory work needed to prove that irrational numbers exist. EDIT: I just found out that Euclid stated the result I want him to prove in a Lemma after Proposition 10.9: It has been proved in the arithmetical books that similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and that, if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, then they are similar plane numbers.

35,Navigating though the surface of a hypersphere in a computer game,Navigating though the surface of a hypersphere in a computer game,,"People in StackOverflow seems not so into this theme, so I thought I could have better luck in here. I had the idea of an spaceship game where the world is confined in the surface of an 4-D hypersphere (also called a 3-sphere). Thus, in seeing it from inside, it would look like a 3-D world, but by navigating in every direction, I would never leave the limited volume of the 3-sphere. To represent the 3-shpere as a ""flat"" 3-D space, I use a stereographic projection, which is very simple to implement, just need to divide the point in the 3-sphere by one minus its w coordinate. To represent the vertices of the objects I am using normalized 4D vectors, such that $x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2=1$, thus keeping them inside the 3-sphere. The first problem to solve was rotation. But I soon figured out that ordinary 3D rotation matrices would suffice to rotate the world around the viewer in the 3D projection, since it does not mess up with the $w$ coordinate (pretty much like rotating a sphere around the z-axis would also rotate its stereographic projection). Then I figured out that any rotation that included the $w$ coordinate would be equivalent of translation inside the 3D projection (just not commutative, as ordinary 3D translations on ""flat"" spaces), then I could translate along the axis by using a simple around axis rotation matrix $(x', y') = (x \ cos a - y  \sin a, x \sin a + y \cos a)$, but varying $w$ along with another axis. This is so far where I got, and I could not figure out how to navigate forward, based on the position the viewer is facing from the projection. I can apply the inverse transform to derive the normalized 4-D vector (called F) the viewer is facing in the hypersphere coordinates, but I don't know how to navigate in that direction by using a $4\times4$ matrix (what is optimal in OpenGL). I could think on a hackish solution: for every vertex $V$, $d V' = \text{normalize}(dF + V)$, where $d$ is the distance moved forward (in some strange unit I can not exactly precise). This way only works for small values of d, there is no direct correlation between d and the angle variation.

Moreover, we note that by definition, the best center should minimize circularity (i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum radius, as referenced from the best center, should be a minimized when this location is truly ""best""). The following plot shows the best center at 0.25, where circularity is indeed minimized. This best center of $y=0.25$ makes intuitive sense, as this is the location that bisects the vertical deformation in the circular shape. The following plot shows the best center of this circular shape, for various number of measurement samples taken at equally spaced angles around the shape.

This produces the following plots, for $R_{base}=1.0$ , $\sigma=\frac{\pi}{6}$ , and $A=0.65644$ . This yielded $K=2.74$ , and shows that the optimal $K$ value is dependent on the circular deformity. I then decided to try a more realistic scenario. Specifically, this whole problem was prompted from a real world application of measuring the circularity of large generator rotors.

The following plots represent the empirical analysis for a 30 foot diameter rotor with a 500 mil (i.e. 500 thousandths of an inch, or half the air gap) deformity. In this case, the parameters of the Gaussian are $R_{base}=180000$ mils, $\sigma=\frac{\pi}{8}$ , and $A=492.2$ . These last plots make sense, as the deformity is 500 mils, and the circularity reduces to the circularity with respect to the origin at $K=0$ , which should yield a circularity of 500 mils.

It can be compactified by adding an $\RP^1$ at its ""boundary"".  If you like, you can think of the hyperbolic plane as being modeled on the open complex upper half-plane, with $\RP^1$ added in at the real axis and at complex infinity.  This compactification has the pleasant property that isometries of the hyperbolic plane agree with isometries of $\RP^1$: an isometry of the hyperbolic plane extends to give an isometry of the boundary, and an isometry of the boundary fills in to give an isometry of the hyperbolic plane. In light of the ""complex upper half-plane"" model, there is a second natural way one might arrive at this object: $\RP^1$ has a natural embedding into $\CP^1$ as the fixed points of the action of $\Gal(\C/R)$.  The other points in $\CP^1$ appear in Galois-conjugate pairs which, without any loss of generality, can be identified with the half of the pair that happens to lie in the upper half-plane.  This makes it clear that automorphisms of $\RP^1$ extend to automorphisms of $\CP^1$: these are exactly the automorphisms of $\CP^1$ (i.e., the Möbius transformations, or linear fractional transformations) which fix $\RP^1$ (i.e., which have real coefficients). What's not obvious from the second presentation is how to start doing plane geometry with $(\CP^1 \setminus \RP^1) \; //\; \Gal(\C/\R)$.  The original presentation of the hyperbolic plane comes equipped with a definition of a line: these are the geodesics for the metric, and one computes that these are given by circles in the complex half-plane with center lying on the real axis.  Explicitly, these are solution sets of equations like $$z \bar z - b (z + \bar z) + c = 0$$ where $b$ and $c$ are real and the solution set is nonempty.  This expression is evidently Galois-invariant, but I can't guess where it would come from in the Galois version of the story. Question: Is there a purely Galois perspective on why this equation deserves to be called anything like a ""line"" in $\CP^1\;//\;\Gal(\C/\R)$? It seems likely to me that this question, if answerable, is a little tricky. For instance, I imagine that it rests on $[\C:\R] = 2$ — one of life's happy accidents, but something obscuring in a question like this.

If you're willing to set up shop and start giving coordinates to the end that draws the ellipse (letting $a$ be the length of the rod, $b$ the distance from interior anchor to free end), it's not too hard to see that \begin{align*} x &= a \cos \theta \\ y &= b\sin \theta, \end{align*} and so in turn $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,$$ verifying the motion is indeed elliptical.

The graphene quasicrystal can be spatially mapped onto a quasicrystal lattice model constructed by dodecagonal compound tessellations (see Figs. 1D-E and Figs. S3D-E in (*supplemental information))) (23-26). Squares, rhombuses, equilateral triangles with different orientations can fill the entire space with a 12-fold rotationally symmetric pattern without translational symmetry. Since the Stampfli tiles have a fractal structure with self-similarity, the same pattern emerges at a larger scale with an irrational scaling factor. For the graphene quasicrystal, the Stampfli tiles have the scaling factor of $\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}$ (Figs. 1D-E and Fig. S3 in SI) 23 . ( note: maybe it's supposed to be S7? ) As shown in the atomic model (Figs. 1C-D), the graphene quasicrystal results in Stampfli tiles such as equilateral triangles and rhombuses. In the false colored TEM image of the graphene quasicrystal transferred from a SiC wafer to a TEM grid (Fig. 1F and Fig. S3D in SI), the Stampfli tiles including squares (blue), rhombuses (red), equilateral triangles (green) with different orientations were obviously observed. The LEED pattern and TEM image clearly support that the twisted bilayer graphene with a rotational angle of 30 ̊ has a quasicrystalline order with 12-fold rotational symmetry. We note that, for TEM experiments, the graphene quasicrystal grown on a SiC wafer should be transferred on other substrates and should be robust to chemical treatments in air. The successful TEM experiments support that graphene quasicrystal can be isolated from a substrate and are chemically and structurally stable at room temperature in air. We expect that the robustness of graphene quasicrystal can lead to further studies on the physical properties and applications.

All of this is from the paper Ahn et al. (2018) Dirac electrons in a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal Science 361, (6404) pp.782-786 (also in arXiv ). The text refers to figures in the paper's supplemental information or ""SI"" as well. The graphene quasicrystal can be spatially mapped onto a quasicrystal lattice model constructed by dodecagonal compound tessellations (see Figs. 1D-E and Figs. S3D-E in (*supplemental information))) (23-26). Squares, rhombuses, equilateral triangles with different orientations can fill the entire space with a 12-fold rotationally symmetric pattern without translational symmetry. Since the Stampfli tiles have a fractal structure with self-similarity, the same pattern emerges at a larger scale with an irrational scaling factor. For the graphene quasicrystal, the Stampfli tiles have the scaling factor of (Figs. 1D-E and Fig. S3 in SI) 23 . ( note: maybe it's supposed to be S7? ) As shown in the atomic model (Figs. 1C-D), the graphene quasicrystal results in Stampfli tiles such as equilateral triangles and rhombuses. In the false colored TEM image of the graphene quasicrystal transferred from a SiC wafer to a TEM grid (Fig. 1F and Fig. S3D in SI), the Stampfli tiles including squares (blue), rhombuses (red), equilateral triangles (green) with different orientations were obviously observed. The LEED pattern and TEM image clearly support that the twisted bilayer graphene with a rotational angle of 30 ̊ has a quasicrystalline order with 12-fold rotational symmetry. We note that, for TEM experiments, the graphene quasicrystal grown on a SiC wafer should be transferred on other substrates and should be robust to chemical treatments in air. The successful TEM experiments support that graphene quasicrystal can be isolated from a substrate and are chemically and structurally stable at room temperature in air. We expect that the robustness of graphene quasicrystal can lead to further studies on the physical properties and applications. Having established quasicrystalline order in our sample , now we discuss its characteristic electronic structures... 23 P. Stampfli, A dodecagonal quasi-periodic lattice in 2 dimensions. Helv. Phys.

73,What makes a geometric construction more or less stable?,What makes a geometric construction more or less stable?,,"As anyone who's actually done geometric construction of n-gons knows, not all construction methods are made equal. Some are very stable (the shape you get is always close to ideal even if you're not absolutely precise, like the construction of a square or octagon), some are very unstable (the notorious construction of the regular 17-gon) and will fail to even produce the correct number of sides if you're not incredibly precise. What's more, different constructions for the same polygon often have differing stability. What exactly makes a construction more or less stable? The number of steps is obviously important, but it seems more complicated than that. For example, it's fairly easy to construct even large power-of-two-gons (16-gon, 32-gon, etc), accurately because all you need to do is bisect. The pentagon though has as few as nine steps to mark all vertices (maybe less, that's the shortest construction I know), but is fairly difficult to construct accurately (they often come out visibly irregular). Has anyone studied or written about this? I'm particularly interested in scale-invariant phenomena (physically bigger constructions are obviously easier).

75,What's the average distance between two discs in the plane?,What's the average distance between two discs in the plane?,,"Consider two discs in the plane of radius $r$ and $s$, with centers separated by a distance $l$.  If we choose a point uniformly at random from each disc, what is the expected distance between the two points?  (This is a generalization of this question .) Is there a simple closed-form solution?  Experimentally (via monte carlo), the answer is something like $2/3 \sqrt{r^2+s^2+(3l/2)^2}$. This has the right limiting properties, e.g. when $r,s \to 0$ or $l \to \infty$, we get simply $l$; and when $s=l=0$ we get $2r/3$, the average distance from the center of the disc, but is only approximately right when $r=s$, $l=0$, where we estimate $2\sqrt{2}/3 r \simeq 0.94 r$ compared to the exact result of $128r/45\pi \simeq 0.91 r$ for the average distance between two points in a single disc. Aside: Writing the experimental result as $\sqrt{(2r/3)^2+(2s/3)^2 + l^2}$ suggests a nice geometric motivation for it, in which we represent each disc as a ring with 2/3 the radius (so each ring has the same average distance from its center as the original disc).  Then we rotate each ring about its center and out of the plane to be perpendicular to the line connecting them (approximately preserving average distance between them).  Now estimate the average distance between the rings by taking a point on each with a phase difference equal to the expected average, namely $\pi/2$.  i.e. WLOG take one ring centered at the origin in the $yz$ plane, and the other centered at $(l,0,0)$, and approximate the average distance between them as the distance between the point $(0,2r/3,0)$ and $(l,0,2s/3)$, which yields the experimental result. Aside 2:  We can improve the approximation by considering the three error sources in the experimental formula: (1) rotating the discs out of the plane, (2) replacing the discs with rings, and (3) approximating the inter-ring distance by two points $\pi/2$ out of phase.  The second error underestimates, since the average self-distance in a unit disc is $128/45\pi \simeq 0.91$ whereas the average self-distance in our 2/3 ring is $8/3\pi \simeq 0.84$.  The third over-estimates, since the average self-distance in the unit ring is $4/\pi \simeq 1.27$ compared to the $\pi/2$ phase difference estimate of $\sqrt{2} \simeq 1.41$.  The product of these two leaves our estimate slightly high (ignoring the first error), so we can introduce a ""phase correction"" and instead estimate as $\sqrt{(2/3)^2(r^2+s^2-2rs \cos \phi) + l^2}$, choosing $\phi$ to make the $r=s$, $l=0$ case correct, namely $\cos \phi = 1 - (64/15\pi)^2/2 \simeq 0.0778$ or $\phi \simeq 0.95 \pi/2$.","Consider two discs in the plane of radius $r$ and $s$, with centers separated by a distance $l$.
