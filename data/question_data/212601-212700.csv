2,Is $\tan(\pi/2)$ undefined or infinity?,Is  undefined or infinity?,\tan(\pi/2),"The way I have understood, $0/0$ is undefined or indeterminate because, if $c=0/0$ then $c\cdot 0=0$, where $c$ can be any finite number including $0$ itself.

As a limiting case of both $\,\sin\,$ and $\,\tan,\,$ $\,f(x)=k_1x\,$ is also a solution, and the simplest. I am looking only for non-zero solutions that have a formal power series expansion. That is, $$ f(x) = a_1 \frac{x^1}{1!} + a_3 \frac{x^3}{3!}  + a_5 \frac{x^5}{5!} + a_7 \frac{x^7}{7!}+ \cdots \tag{2}$$ is the exponential generating function for the sequence $\,(0,a_1,0,a_3,0,a_5,0,\dots).\,$ For a solution of the above functional equation, if $\,a_1=0\,$ then $\,f(x)\equiv 0.\,$ Otherwise, $\,a_1\ne 0\,$ and $\,a_3,a_5\,$ can be arbitrary while the rest of the coefficients are determined uniquely. I used Mathematica to compute the first few coefficients. I found, for example, $$ a_7 \!=\! \frac{11 a_1 a_3 a_5\!-\!10 a_3^3}{a_1^2}, \;\;a_9 \!=\! \frac{21 a_1^2 a_5^2 \!+\!60 a_1 a_3^2 a_5 \!-\!80 a_3^4}{a_1^3},\;\;\dots. \tag{3}$$ I know of $18$ similar identities for $\,\sin\,$ and $\,\tan\,$ (including this one) in three or more variables. They have some common features as follows. Each is an irreducible homogeneous polynomial equated to zero where each monomial term in the polynomial is a product of factors each of which is of the form $\,f(x)\,$ where $\,x\,$ is a variable or an integer linear combination of variables. I also require that $\,f(x) = k_1x\,$ is a solution in which case the functional equation is a homogeneous algebraic identity. As a non-example , the similar looking non-homogeneous functional equation $$ f(a\!-\!b)\!+\!f(b\!-\!c)\!+\!f(c\!-\!a)\!-\! f(a\!-\!b)f(b\!-\!c)f(c\!-\!a)\!=\!0 \tag{4}$$ has only the non-zero solutions $\,f(x) = \tan(k_2x),\; k_2\ne0 \,$ and thus, does not qualify. I am interested in those which are satisfied by both $f=\sin$ and $f=\tan$ . In all but one of the identities of this kind that I know of, they are also satisfied by the familfy of functions $\,f(x)=k_1\text{sn}(k_2\,x|m),\,$ where sn is a Jacobi elliptic function as well as two other related elliptic function sc, sd. The one exception is for an identity with Jacobi Zeta and Epsilon function solutions. This leads to two natural questions. 1. Do identities exist with solutions aside from the Jacobi functions mentioned? 2. Do identities exist with only sine and tangent solutions?

I used Mathematica to compute the first few coefficients. I found, for example, I know of similar identities for and (including this one) in three or more variables.

Each is an irreducible homogeneous polynomial equated to zero where each monomial term in the polynomial is a product of factors each of which is of the form where is a variable or an integer linear combination of variables. I also require that is a solution in which case the functional equation is a homogeneous algebraic identity.

27,How to find the approximate basic period or GCD of a list of numbers?,How to find the approximate basic period or GCD of a list of numbers?,,"I want to tell the number which act as the best approximate basic period (or wavelenght as pointed out by Eric) of a list of real numbers: e.g for { 14, 21, 35 } we should obtain 7 as the basic period, the same as for { 17, 24, 38 }(same numbers with an offset) or for  { 14.5, 21.3, 34.4 }(same numbers with some error), etc. It is a kind of approximate GCD algorithm which ignores any offset. The original use case was that of determining the rate of a heartbeat received from a computer, where beats are randomly skipped, based on their timestamps. I've come to a possible solution which I'm stuck with: the solutions will minimize the variance of the remainder of the division of the values in the list by the chosen factor $T$ (that's the solution), and I have reached the following formula: being $v$ the list $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ , $\operatorname{mean}_{\sin}(v, T)$ $= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\sin(2\pi v_i/T)$ $\operatorname{mean}_{\cos}(v, T)$ $= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\cos(2\pi v_i/T)$ $\operatorname{period}_{appeal}(v, T)$ $= \sqrt{\operatorname{mean}_{\sin}(v, T)^2 + \operatorname{mean}_{\cos}(v, T)^2} = \frac{1}{n}\sqrt{n + 2\sum_{i\lt j}^n{\cos{\frac{2\pi(v_i-v_j)}{T}}}}$ $\Rightarrow v \approx T·x + \frac{T}{2\pi}\operatorname{atan2}(\operatorname{mean}_{\sin}, \operatorname{mean}_{\cos}), x \in \mathbb{Z}$ Note that $\operatorname{period}_{appeal}$ , as it is (rather obscurely) only dependent on the differences between the elements in the list, ignores a constant offset, that is, $\operatorname{period}_{appeal}(v, T)$ $= \operatorname{period}_{appeal}(w, T)$ where $w_i = v_i + k \ \forall{i}\forall{k}$ which is great for my original use case. However, we can tune the formula to find the approximate GCD instead, which assumes no offset is present, $\operatorname{gcd}_{appeal}(v, T)$ = $1 - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\operatorname{mean}_{\sin}(v, T)^2 + (\operatorname{mean}_{\cos}(v, T) - 1)^2}$ $\Rightarrow v \approx T·x, x \in \mathbb{Z}$ This is what they look like for $v = [14, 21, 35]$ , period in blue, gcd in green they both offer maximum appeal at 7, 7/2, 7/3,...,7/z, including at the $\infty$ limits (7/0), as $v_i$ are perfect multiples of 7 (and thus of 7/z).

Since they are both equal to the same integral, they must be equal as well (and we can easily prove that by doing some simple calculation). But what makes it interesting is, a lot of common mathematics software cannot do this kind of simplification (I tried SageMath and WolframAlpha, they both did nothing).

As you can see, the key step here is the factorization $10\sqrt2+23i=\left(2\sqrt2+i\right)^3$ . This is a factorization in $\mathbb Z[\sqrt2,i]$ , which might be difficult even for computers (I'm not sure). What's more, normally there's not just $\sqrt2$ that appears, e.g. $$\arctan\frac{\sqrt5-77\sqrt2}{7+11\sqrt{10}}=3\arctan\sqrt5+5\arctan\sqrt2-3\pi.$$ So here is my question: Is there an algorithmic way to do this kind of simplification? Let me explain a little where this problem comes from. I got an integral, for $a>0$ : $$\int_0^\infty e^{-at}\left(\operatorname{erf}\sqrt t\right)^3\,dt=\frac{4}{\pi}\frac1{a\sqrt{a+1}}\arctan\frac{1-b}{1+b},$$ where $b=\frac{a}{a+4}\sqrt{\frac{a+3}{a+1}}$ . I wanted to simplify this expression but failed. The example mentioned before is just the case $a=1$ . I'd be glad if anyone can simplify this expression for any $a>0$ , and I'll take it as an acceptable answer since I think this expression is already complicated enough. I added my answer to the integral problem only. $$\int_0^\infty e^{-at}\left(\operatorname{erf}\sqrt t\right)^3\,dt=\frac{12}{\pi}\frac1{a\sqrt{a+1}}\left(\arctan\sqrt{\frac{a+3}{a+1}}-\frac\pi4\right).$$ And it didn't give us a general method to deal with all cases.","This is a problem I encountered in another (unrelated) question .

45,What makes radians superior to turns/revolutions?,What makes radians superior to turns/revolutions?,,"1. THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM This question came to me when I was exploring complex exponents. The key identity to computing expressions with complex exponents is the Euler's identity: $$e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta$$ This enables us to compute, for example what $2^i$ is by some algebraic manipulation. The computation is as follows: $$2^i=e^{\ln2^i}=e^{i\ln2}=\cos\ln2+i\sin\ln2\;\approx\;0.769+0.639i$$ 2. THE PROBLEM A question arises in my head. We compute sines and cosines with radian values. And since $\ln2\approx0.693$ then $\sin\ln 2$ will be the $y$ coordinate of the unit circle when the angle is $0.693$ radians . But if we use turns instead of radians, then $\sin\ln 2$ will be the $y$ coordinate of the unit circle when the angle is $0.693$ turns . So the value of sine when using turns or radians is different. Similarly, the value of cosine is different. But that creates a problem. When using radians , $2^i$ computes to about $0.769+0.639i$. But when using turns , $2^i$ computes to about $0.994+0.110i$. 3. POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS The problem above illustrates that $2^i$ and any expression with complex exponent is a generalisation that directly depends on what units we use for angles. There are only two possibilities of ""the state of truth"" that this fact implies. Either complex exponents are a concept completely made up by humans which would mean that expressions like these are really undefined to the code of the universe (we only make it defined because we think that radians are the true angle units), or there must be a unit that is the truest unit for measuring angles, whether that would be radians or something else. If the first statement is true, then this would mean that we can accept $2^i$ to be $0.769+0.639i$. After all, this concept would be defined by radians only because we defined it like this. However, if the second statement is true, then there are even more questions to be asked. If there is a ""truest"" unit for measuring angles then what is it? Perhaps radians are really the truest unit, meaning that $2^i$ is unambiguously $0.769+0.639i$, but if so, what justifies this fact? What makes radians truer than turns?","1.

As you can see from the diagram, the vertical minor axis for the ellipse becomes slanted, making the top of the ellipse ""longer"" than the bottom of the ellipse - which follows the stretching of the enclosing space. But the ellipse should still touch the top and bottom of the slanted minor axis, as well as touching the left-hand end of the center green curve, which is the transformed major axis for the ellipse.
