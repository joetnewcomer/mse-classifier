44,Understanding $n\choose k$ in terms of sum and product rules,Understanding  in terms of sum and product rules,n\choose k,"This is a follow up on my earlier question. To put some values and context, let me say I am trying to justify the number of possibilities of choosing 2 chapters out of 10 in a book i,e $10 \choose 2$. At this point this is just notation. One way to enumerate the possibilities: $$\underbrace{\underbrace{(1,2),(1,3)\cdots,(1,10)}_{9}\underbrace{(2,1),(2,3)\cdots,(2,10)}_{9}\cdots\underbrace{(10,1),(10,2)\cdots,(10,9)}_{9}}_{10}$$ So we have $10\cdot 9$ possibilities but we've double counted pairs such as $(n,m)$ and $(m,n)$ so we have $\frac{10\cdot 9}{2}$. Now I try to reason with the sum and product rules I've learnt and once again Im confused, which might become detrimental if I go further. Say I select chapter $1$. I can select chapter $2$ OR $3$ etc. Once I have selected one chapter, the selection of the other chapter is independent w.r.t one another,  so using the sum rule I can make total $9$ possible selections once I have selected the first chapter. But then, I can make $10$ different choices of the first chapter. Now it is clear in my mind that each one of these ten possible selections come bundled with 9 possibilities, so multiply the two. But when I read the definition many times and try to bring in a ""product-rule argument"" and I just cannot. It should come as easily as the thought that I should multiply it, so I've only understood the product rule in words. Please enlighten me. Another thing I noticed, was that this could be achieved using a purely sum rule argument. Consider the enumeration scheme where we avoid repetition altogether $$\underbrace{(1,2),(1,3),\cdots,(1,10)}_{9},\underbrace{(2,3),(2,4),\cdots,(2,10)}_{8}\underbrace{(3,4),(3,5),\cdots,(3,10)}_{7},\cdots\underbrace{(9,10)}_1$$ $$=9+8+\cdots+1=\frac{10\cdot 9}{2}$$ Only the sum rule has been used in this argument. And it is much easier for me to understand. So, a parenthetical query: can a purely product rule argument be used for selections? It does not seem so for me. It appears the sum rule is fundamental and product rule is a special case of it. Which might seem like saying that multiplication is a special case of addition in discrete case. Once again, this last paragraph is just a parenthetical query and not my immediate concern at the moment.","This is a follow up on my earlier question.

I managed to derive a nice reason for why: which is because the determinant is equivalent to the polynomial: (Try it! It works :) - Incidentally, would this be a common result in some textbook?) But then, I playfully decided to just make a single (non-diagonal) matrix entry equal to zero, keeping all the others still at , and stumbled upon this other pattern: (The above works regardless of which non-diagonal entry you choose to make zero, of course.) Can anyone help me understand why? Might this be related to MacMahon's Master Theorem? Or is there some more obvious way to think about this result?","\mathbf{SETUP} n \times n
