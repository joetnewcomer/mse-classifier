Thanks a million.","I ran across a series that is rather challenging.  For kicks I ran it through Maple and it gave me a conglomeration involving digamma. Mathematica gave a solution in terms of Lerch Transcendent, which was worse yet.  Perhaps residues would be a better method?. But, it is $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}(k+1)}{(2k+1)^{2}-a^{2}}.$$ The answer Maple spit out was: $$\frac{a+1}{16a}\left[\psi\left(\frac{3}{4}-\frac{a}{4}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{-a}{4}+\frac{1}{4}\right)\right]+\frac{a-1}{16a}\left[\psi\left(\frac{3}{4}+\frac{a}{4}\right)-\psi\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{a}{4}\right)\right]+\frac{1}{a^{2}-1}.$$ Is it possible to actually get to something like this by using $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+a}\right]=\gamma+\psi(a+1)?$ I tried, but to no avail.  But, then again, maybe it is too cumbersome. i.e. I tried expanding it into $\frac{k+1}{(2k+1)^{2}-a^{2}}=\frac{-1}{4(a-2k-1)(2k+1)}-\frac{1}{4(a-2k-1)}+\frac{1}{4(a+2k+1)(2k+1)}+\frac{1}{4(a+2k+1)}$ then using $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{a}{4}}\right]=\psi\left(\frac{3}{4}-\frac{a}{4}\right)$ and so on, but it did not appear to be anywhere close to the given series. On another point, can it be done using residues?. By using $$\frac{\pi csc(\pi z)(z+1)}{(2z+1)^{2}-a^{2}}.$$ This gave me a residue at $\frac{a-1}{2} and  \frac{-(a+1)}{2}$ of $\frac{-\pi}{a-1}sec(a\pi/2)$ and $\frac{\pi}{a+1}sec(\pi a/2)$ Taking the negative sum of the residues, it is $\frac{2\pi}{(a-1)(a+1)}sec(a\pi/2)$ By subbing in k=0 into the series, it gives $\frac{-1}{a^{2}-1}$. I try adding them up and finding the sum, but it does not appear to work out. Any suggestions?.  Perhaps there is another method I am not trying?.  There probably is.

So far I know how to use and prove Cauchy's, D'Alambert's and the integral criterion, so I'd like a hint on either using those or a new idea. The book suggests that for $1$, I show that $$\sum\limits_{k = N}^n {{a_k} \leq  \frac{{{a_N}{b_N}}}{r}} $$ and for $2$, to prove that $\displaystyle\sum a_n$ dominates $\displaystyle\sum \dfrac{1}{b_n}$ I'd like to prove this with previous theory on series convergence (Cauchy's and/or D'Alambert's preferrably, comparison test) since it is what precedes the problem, and would appreaciate great HINTS rather than answers. I can't seem to understand the inequalities. I mean, Cauchy's and D'Alambert's criteria reveal that the proof relies on the fact that a geometric series of with ratio $|r| < 1$ converges, but I can't understand the motivation in this proof.

Please guide how to solve this problem . Thanks.","Question : Find the sum to n terms of the series $\frac{1}{1.2.3}+\frac{3}{2.3.4}+\frac{5}{3.4.5}+\frac{7}{4.5.6}+\cdots$ What I have done : nth term of numerator and denominator is $2r-1$ and $r(r+1)(r+2)$ respectively. Therefore the nth term of given series is : $\frac{2r-1}{r(r+1)(r+2)} =\frac{A}{r}+\frac{B}{r+1}+\frac{C}{r+2}$ .....(1) By using partial fraction : and solving for A,B and C we get A = 1/2, B = -1, C =1/2 Putting the values of A,B and C in (1) we get : $\frac{1}{2r}-\frac{1}{r+1}+\frac{1}{2(r+2)}$ But by putting $r =1,2,3, \cdots$  I am not getting the answer.

94,Let $g(k)$ be the greatest odd divisor of $k$ show that $ 0< \sum_{k=1}^n \frac {g(k)}{k} - \frac {2n}{3} \lt \frac 23$,Let  be the greatest odd divisor of  show that,g(k) k  0< \sum_{k=1}^n \frac {g(k)}{k} - \frac {2n}{3} \lt \frac 23,"Prove that for all positive intergers $n$ , $$ 0< \sum_{k=1}^n  \frac {g(k)}{k} - \frac {2n}{3} < \frac {2}{3}$$ Where $g(k)$ denotes the greatest odd divisor of $k$ . Here's my try: All numbers $k$ can be written as $k= 2^ts$ , for nonnegative $t$ and odd $s$ , therefore if $k= 2^ts$ , then $\frac {g(k)}{k} = \frac {1}{2^k}$ i.e $\frac {g(k)}{k}$ is equal to $1$ divided by the highest power of $2$ dividing $k$ . I first thought of proving the inequality for $k= 2^n (n>1)$ . Let $Q= \sum_{k=1}^{2^n}  \frac {g(k)}{k}$ , then: $$Q = \frac {1}{2}q_1 +\frac {1}{2^2}q_2 + \cdots + \frac {1}{2^{n -1}} q_{2^{n -1}}+  \frac {1}{2^n} q_{2^n}+ 2^{n-1} $$ . $q_i$ is the number of times $\frac {1}{2^i}$ is added in the summation. It's easy to notice that $q_{2^n} =1$ . $q_i$ for $0< i < 2^n$ would be equal to $2^{n-1-i}$ (comes from this $(2^i)(2(2^{n-1-i})-1)$ ). Then: $$Q= 2^{n-1}+ \frac {1}{2^n} + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}  \frac{1}{2^i} \cdot 2^{n-1-i}  $$ $$Q = 2^{n-1}+ \frac {1}{2^n} + 2^{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}  (\frac{1}{4})^i  $$ EDITED With some algebra we get that: $$Q - \frac {2}{3} \cdot 2^n= - \frac {4}{3} \cdot 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1}+ \frac {1}{2^n} + 2^{n-1} \cdot \frac {4^{n-1}-1}{4^{n-1}} \cdot \frac {1}{3} <  \frac {1}{2^n} < \frac {2}{3} $$ Also: $$ Q - \frac {2}{3} \cdot 2^n = \frac {1}{2^n} - \frac {2^{n-1}}{4^{n-1}} \cdot \frac {1}{3}= \frac {1}{2^n} - \frac {1}{2^{n-1}} \cdot \frac {1}{3}> \frac {1}{2^n} - \frac {1}{2^{n-1}} \cdot \frac {1}{2}= 0$$ Then I would get: $$ 0< Q - \frac {2}{3} \cdot 2^n < \frac {2}{3}$$ Well, I thought proving the inequality for $k=2^n$ because I had some idea about how many times the powers of $2$ appeared. I then thought that I could go backwards with induction but I'm stuck. I would like to see some other approaches but I would also like to know if it's possible to solve the problem from the point where I am.
