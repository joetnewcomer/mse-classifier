50,"(existence of) not Lipschitz function for every bound closed interval in $[0,1]$ with real values",(existence of) not Lipschitz function for every bound closed interval in  with real values,"[0,1]","Background: this question was asked in the course ""Introduction to topology and metric spaces"" Prove that there exists a continuous function $f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ such that that for every $0 \leq r < s \leq 1$, $f$ is not Lipschitz on $[s,t]$. Since the question was not asked in calculus or any kind of analytical course, I'm pretty sure that they don't expect a constructive proof. Since all continuous functions $f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ are bound, then it follows that the metric space of these functions (with the supremum metric function) is a complete metric space. So far my main direction was using Cantor's intersection theorem to find the desired function in the intersection of a series of closed sets. The main problem is that the set of all such functions which are not Lipschitz on a specific $[s,t]$ is not a closed set. Another problem would be ordering these sets so that they are well-ordered and contained in one another. Both these problems make me think that even if Cantor's theorem is the right tool, I'm going about it the wrong way.","Background: this question was asked in the course ""Introduction to topology and metric spaces"" Prove that there exists a continuous function $f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ such that that for every $0 \leq r < s \leq 1$, $f$ is not Lipschitz on $[s,t]$. Since the question was not asked in calculus or any kind of analytical course, I'm pretty sure that they don't expect a constructive proof. Since all continuous functions $f\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ are bound, then it follows that the metric space of these functions (with the supremum metric function) is a complete metric space. So far my main direction was using Cantor's intersection theorem to find the desired function in the intersection of a series of closed sets.

Can you check my proof? I never used that $A$ is open. Lemma 1. If $U,V$ are subsets of a metric space, then $\overline{U\cup V}=\overline{U}\cup\overline{V}$ . Lemma 2. If $U$ is a subset of a metric space, then $$\overline{U^c}=(U^\circ)^c\mbox{ and }(U^c)^\circ=(\overline{U})^c$$ My proof (of the excercise): Since $D=A\cup (A^c)^\circ$ , by part 2 of Lemma 2 we have $D=A\cup(\overline{A})^c$ . Then, by Lemma 1, $\overline{D}=\overline{A}\cup\overline{(\overline{A})^c}$ . Now, from part 1 of Lemma 2, we have $D=\overline{A}\cup((\overline{A})^\circ)^c...(1)$ Now, since $(\overline{A})^\circ\subseteq\overline{A}$ , then $(\overline{A})^c\subseteq((\overline{A})^\circ)^c$ , so, taking union with $\overline{A}$ on both sides we have $X=\overline{A}\cup(\overline{A})^c\subseteq\overline{A}\cup((\overline{A})^\circ)^c$ . But the right hand side of the last inclusion is, by (1), $\overline{D}$ , so $X\subseteq\overline{D}$ and done.

66,Infinite and non-abelian fundamental group,Infinite and non-abelian fundamental group,,"$\require{AMScd}$ I ran into trouble while trying to answer this question. I am trying to prove the following: Suppose $U_1,U_2$ and $U_3 := U_1 \cap U_2$ are open, path-connected subsets of $X = U_1 \cup U_2$ .

Using van Kampen, we get the following commutative diagram: \begin{CD} \mathbb{Z}/2 @>\varphi_1>> \mathbb{Z}/3\\ @V\varphi_2VV  @VV\psi_1V  \\ \mathbb{Z}/4 @>\psi_2>> \pi_1(X)  \end{CD} Here, $\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\psi_1,\psi_2$ are the homomorphisms induced by the canonical inclusions $U_3 \hookrightarrow U_1$ , $U_3 \hookrightarrow U_2$ , $U_1 \hookrightarrow X$ and $U_2 \hookrightarrow X$ respectively. Now, since $$ \# \text{Hom}_\mathbb{Z}(\mathbb{Z}/2,\mathbb{Z}/3) = \gcd(2,3) = 1, $$ we must have that $\varphi_1 = 0$ is the zero map.

So now we prove the following statements: any zero-set is closed and any conul set is open and moreover the sets $\varnothing$ and $X$ are respectively zero-set and cozero-set; the finite union and the finite intersection of zero-sets or cozero-sets is respectively zero-set or cozero-set; a $T_1$ space $X$ is completely regular iff for any $x\in X$ the collection of cozero-set neighborhoods of $x$ is a local basis for $x$ ; if $X$ is completely regular then the collection of cozero open sets is a basis. Proof . Since in the above definition $f$ is a continuous function and since $\{0\}$ is closed in the euclidean topology -indeed $(\Bbb{R},\mathcal{T}_e)$ is a $T_1$ space- it result that $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ is closed and so a zero-set is closed and thus a cozero-set is open. Then since the costant function $f:X\owns x\rightarrow 0\in\Bbb{R}$ is trivially continuous and since $f^{-1}(\{0\})=X$ it result that $X$ is zero-set and $\varnothing$ is cozero-set. So we proved 1. Now we suppose that $X$ a comletely regular space and so let be $x\in U$ a open neighborhood of $x$ : since $X$ is a Tychonoff space we can claim that there exist a continuous function $f:X\rightarrow[0,1]$ such that $f(X\setminus U)=\{0\}$ and so this means that every open sets are cozero-set and so the local basis of open neighborhood of $x$ is a local basis of cozero-sets. Therefore now we suppose that $X$ is a $T_1$ space such that any its point have a cozero-set local basis and so let be $F$ a closed set and $x\notin F$ : since $X\setminus F$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ there exist a cozero-set neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such $x\in U\subseteq X\setminus F$ , from which it result $F\subseteq X\setminus U$ ; and since $U$ is cozero-set there exist a coutinuous function $f:X\rightarrow\Bbb{R}$ such that $(X\setminus U)=f^{-1}(\{0\})$ and so it is clear that $f(F)=(\{0\})$ and $f(x)\neq 0$ and so for what I proved here -is it correct?- we can claim that $X$ is a completely regular space.
