2,find the number of ways to distribute six handouts,find the number of ways to distribute six handouts,,"Fifteen freshmen are sitting in a circle around a table, but the course assistant (who remains standing) has made only six copies of today's handout. No freshman should get more than one handout, and any freshmen who doesn't get one should be able to read a neighbor's. If the freshmen are distinguishable but the handouts are not, how many ways are there to distribute the six handouts subject to the above conditions? I think the answer is 750, and my reasoning is shown below. We consider the sequences of 6 gap sizes between consecutive students. By the problem conditions, each sequence must consist only of the numbers 0,1,2 and sum to 9. The only possibilities up to ordering are $1,1,1,2,2,2$ and $2,2,2,2,0,1,2$ . Distinct sequences are not cyclic shifts of each other because they involve at least two different numbers. Each sequence corresponds to 15 possibilities, which are the cyclic shifts of the sequences (since the freshmen are distinct while the handouts are not and cyclic shifts are distinct). So we have $\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} + \dfrac{6! }{4!} = 50$ sequences, giving $50\cdot 15 = 750$ possibilities.

8,find all n so that eventually all lamps will be turned off,find all n so that eventually all lamps will be turned off,,"We have $n\ge 2$ lamps $L_1,\cdots, L_n$ in a row, each of them being either on or off. Every second we simultaneously modify the state of each lamp as follows: If the lamp $L_i$ and its neighbours (only one neighbour for $i=1$ or $i=n$ , two neighbours for other $i$ are in the same state, $L_i$ is switched off; Otherwise, $L_i$ is switched on. Initially, all the lamps are off except the leftmost one. For example, if we take $n=4$ and let the binary sequence $b_1\cdots b_n$ represent the current configuration, where $b_i=1$ if lamp $L_i$ is on and $0$ otherwise, then we initially have the consecutive configurations $1000, 1100, 0110, 1111, 0000.$ Find all $n\ge 2$ so that eventually all lamps will be turned off. Note that no odd value of n will work, as the proof below shows. Indeed, one can prove by induction on the number of steps (after the first step, when the sequence consists of $2$ ones followed by $n-2$ zeroes) that the sequence always has a form consisting of blocks of ones of even length where consecutive blocks are separated by blocks of zeroes of even length ( $\ge 2$ ). All entries between the second and second last entries of any block will become 0's in the next step. Then the first and last entries will be ones. So each block of zeroes will have its first and last entries replaced by 1's and hence remain even in length while each block of ones will have all but two entries replaced with zeroes. But the two entries that remain at one, assuming the block of ones is preceded and followed by blocks of zeroes, form two groups of two with the closest element in the neighbouring block of zeroes. In the special case when the block includes the first position, the first position becomes zero. If the block of ones includes the last position, the last position becomes zero. And so if the block of ones includes the first and last positions, it becomes zero in the next move. Otherwise, assume WLOG that a block of zeroes of even length follows the block and the block includes the first position. Then the block is replaced by a block of two ones, one following the block and one in the last position of the block. This shows that after one step the described form is maintained. So in particular, the above proof shows that there will always be a block of ones of even, positive length, assuming one never obtains a full block of ones of even length. Hence no odd value of n will allow all lamps to eventually be turned off. Also the next proof shows that any power of two will work: For notational purposes, let for a digit $ x, x^{(i)}$ denote the digit $x$ repeated $i$ times in a sequence. We can prove by induction that for $n = 2^k,$ we can get a sequence ending in $1^{(2^k)}$ after $2^k - 1$ steps. For $n = 2^{k+1},$ by the inductive hypothesis, we can get the block $1^{(2^{k})}0^{(2^k)}$ because the last one after the mth step is at position m + 1 (and all other entries are zeroes, so they can effectively be ignored). This takes $2^k - 1$ steps by the inductive hypothesis. Then we can get $0^{(2^k-1)} 11 0^{(2^k-1)}$ after one step. Then one can prove that after $2^{i-1}$ steps, starting with a block of size $2^i$ in the center, we can get a block of size $2^{i+1}$ in the center. In the base case where $i = 1,$ we get $0^{(2^k-2)}11110^{(2^k-2)}$ after one more step. Assuming the claim holds for i, starting with a block of ones size $2^(i+1)$ in the center, after the first step, we get the sequence $110^{(2^(i+1) - 2)} 11$ in the center. Then after the mth step, we replace the first and last zeroes in the center with 1's and we replace the zeroes right before and after the sequence with ones, assuming there are still zeroes. So after each step we reduce the length of the zero block in the center by 2 (except for the first one, in which case the length of the zero block becomes $2^{i+1}-2$ for the first time). Hence after $2^i$ steps the zero block in the center becomes a one block of size $2^{i+1}$ and $2^{i+1}$ ones are added to the sides, forming a block of size $2^{i+2}$ . Hence we take $2^k - 1 + 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1}-2$ steps to get to the all ones block of size $2^{k+1}$ . One last step brings us to $2^(k+1)- 1$ steps in total and we get the all zeroes block. But what about other even values of $n$ ? Obviously once a configuration repeats, the sequence of configurations represented in binary will be periodic from that point on. $n=6$ is impossible: we have the sequence of configurations $100000, 110000, 011000, 111100, 000110, 001111, 011000, 111100,$ which is periodic with period 4. Note that the sequence is also symmetric; if one starts with the reverse of a sequence and the terms of the original sequence are $B_1,B_2,\cdots $ , one gets the mirror image back at each step. That is if the new sequence is $A_1,A_2,\cdots $ , then $A_i$ is the reverse of $B_i$ for all $i$ . To prove this, we do it by induction on the number of steps, with the proof for the step being the following: consider a configuration represented in binary, say $B_i.$ Write $B_i = b_1\cdots b_n$ . Note that for $2\leq i \leq n-1,$ lamp $L_i$ is switched on or off iff lamp $L_{n+1 - i}'$ is switched on/off, where $L_{k}'$ is the kth lamp represented by the configuration $A_i$ . For instance, if $L_i$ is switched off, then $L_i$ had the same state as its neighbours $L_{i-1}$ and $L_{i+1}$ . So $L_{n+1 - (i-1)}$ and $L_{n-(i+1)}$ have the same state as $L_{n+1 - i}$ by induction, and hence $L_{n+1 - i}$ is switched off. The other cases are similar. And the case where $i=1$ or $n$ is also similar. For $n=10,$ we get $1000000000, 1100000000, 0110000000, 1111000000, 0001100000, 0011110000, 0110011000, 1111111100, 0000000110$ , and this is also impossible.","We have lamps in a row, each of them being either on or off.

We can prove by induction that for we can get a sequence ending in after steps. For by the inductive hypothesis, we can get the block because the last one after the mth step is at position m + 1 (and all other entries are zeroes, so they can effectively be ignored). This takes steps by the inductive hypothesis. Then we can get after one step. Then one can prove that after steps, starting with a block of size in the center, we can get a block of size in the center. In the base case where we get after one more step. Assuming the claim holds for i, starting with a block of ones size in the center, after the first step, we get the sequence in the center. Then after the mth step, we replace the first and last zeroes in the center with 1's and we replace the zeroes right before and after the sequence with ones, assuming there are still zeroes. So after each step we reduce the length of the zero block in the center by 2 (except for the first one, in which case the length of the zero block becomes for the first time). Hence after steps the zero block in the center becomes a one block of size and ones are added to the sides, forming a block of size . Hence we take steps to get to the all ones block of size . One last step brings us to steps in total and we get the all zeroes block. But what about other even values of ? Obviously once a configuration repeats, the sequence of configurations represented in binary will be periodic from that point on. is impossible: we have the sequence of configurations which is periodic with period 4. Note that the sequence is also symmetric; if one starts with the reverse of a sequence and the terms of the original sequence are , one gets the mirror image back at each step. That is if the new sequence is , then is the reverse of for all . To prove this, we do it by induction on the number of steps, with the proof for the step being the following: consider a configuration represented in binary, say Write . Note that for lamp is switched on or off iff lamp is switched on/off, where is the kth lamp represented by the configuration . For instance, if is switched off, then had the same state as its neighbours and . So and have the same state as by induction, and hence is switched off. The other cases are similar. And the case where or is also similar. For we get , and this is also impossible.","n\ge 2 L_1,\cdots, L_n L_i i=1 i=n i L_i L_i n=4 b_1\cdots b_n b_i=1 L_i 0 1000, 1100, 0110, 1111, 0000. n\ge 2 2 n-2 \ge 2  x, x^{(i)} x i n = 2^k, 1^{(2^k)} 2^k - 1 n = 2^{k+1}, 1^{(2^{k})}0^{(2^k)} 2^k - 1 0^{(2^k-1)} 11 0^{(2^k-1)} 2^{i-1} 2^i 2^{i+1} i = 1, 0^{(2^k-2)}11110^{(2^k-2)} 2^(i+1) 110^{(2^(i+1) - 2)} 11 2^{i+1}-2 2^i 2^{i+1} 2^{i+1} 2^{i+2} 2^k - 1 + 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+1}-2 2^{k+1} 2^(k+1)- 1 n n=6 100000, 110000, 011000, 111100, 000110, 001111, 011000, 111100, B_1,B_2,\cdots  A_1,A_2,\cdots  A_i B_i i B_i.

Every great circle divides $S$ into two parts. A hemisphere is the union of the great circle and one of these two parts. Show that if five points are placed arbitrarily on $S$ , then there is a hemisphere that contains four of them. $\bf{My\,answer}$ : Let $A=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_5\}$ be a set of arbitrarily placed points on the sphere $S$ . Since 3 points are sufficient to define a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , we can construct a plane $P$ by taking any two elements of $A$ and the center $c$ of $S$ .

Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are on a great circle of $S$ , both hemispheres $H_1$ and $H_2$ contain $p_1$ and $p_2$ . Now, let's look at the remaining points $p_3,p_4$ and $p_5$ . Notice that for $k\in\{3,4,5\}$ , it follows that $p_k\in H_1$ or $p_k\in H_2$ .

Let us assume that claim holds for $K_{n}$ and that $n \geq 1$ , Prove that claim holds for $n+1$ Let us have $K_{n+1}$ and remove a vertex $v\in V(K_{n+1})$ , therefore we get that $|V(K_{n+1})|-v = n (K_{n})$ , which holds by the $IH$ . Let us add back vertex v, we need to make sure graph still remains as a complete graph, therefore, while adding the $n+1$ 'th vertex (v), we need to have $deg(v) = n$ , so number of edges will be $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+\frac{2n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ , which means claim holds for $K_{n+1}$ as well.

35,Understanding a proof regarding the relationship between rational generating functions and linear recurrence relations,Understanding a proof regarding the relationship between rational generating functions and linear recurrence relations,,"I'm trying to understand this lemma from my course notes: It's my understanding that a linear recurrence relation is one of the form $x_n = p(n, x_{n - 1}, \dots, x_{n - k}) = q(n) + b_1 x_{n - 1} + b_2 x_{n - 2} + \dots + b_k x_{n - k}$ for $n \geq k$ . This recurrence relation is homogeneous if $q = 0$ . I find the above proof very terse, so below I give my understanding along with comments/questions where I don't understand things. First part: Rational generating function defines a homogeneous linear recurrence relation Start with $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$ where $g(x) = b_l x^l + \dots + b_0$ and $h(x) = c_k x^k + \dots + c_0$ . Bring the denominator over to the left so you get $(c_k x^k + \dots + c_i x_i) (a_0 + a_1 x + \dots ) = b_l x^l + \dots + b_0$ . We want to set up something like $a_j = \alpha_1 a_{j - 1} + \dots + \alpha_n a_{j - n}$ . Because we are trying to set up a linear homogeneous recurrence relation, we clearly need to set up something that will work for all $j > \text{[something]}$ , but it's not clear at this stage what that something should be. Clearly based on the product $(c_k x^k + \dots + c_i x_i) (a_0 + a_1 x + \dots )$ we are going to get products of $a$ coefficients with $c$ coefficients. This suggests that we might have to divide an expression involving $a_j c_{\text{something}}$ by $c_{\text{something}}$ in order to isolate $a_j$ . The only two $c_{\text{something}}$ s that we know are not equal to zero are $c_i$ and $c_k$ (which may or may not be distinct). If we try to work with $c_k$ then we would be looking at the coefficient for the $x^{k + j}$ term, which would be something like $c_k a_j + c_{k - 1} a_{j + 1} + \dots + c_i a_{j + (k - i + 1)}$ . This doesn't look like the type of expression we're looking for ( $a_j = \alpha_1 a_{j - 1} + \dots + \alpha_n a_{j - n}$ ) so we'll try using $c_i$ . If we use $c_i$ then we are looking at the coefficient for the $x^{i + j}$ term, which would be something like $c_i a_j + c_{i + 1} a_{j - 1} + \dots + c_k a_{j - (k - i)}$ . Comparing both sides of $(c_k x^k + \dots + c_i x_i) (a_0 + a_1 x + \dots ) = b_l x^l + \dots + b_0$ , we see that $c_i a_j + c_{i + 1} a_{j - 1} + \dots + c_k a_{j - (k - i)} = b_{i + j}$ . We want $b_{i + j} = 0$ so that we can just divide by $c_i$ and move terms over and get our desired recurrence relation. This implies a restriction $i + j > l$ . We also see that we need $j - (k - i) \geq 0$ , so our restrictions on $j$ are that $j > l - i$ and $j \geq k - i$ . Given this, we can divide both sides of $c_i a_j + c_{i + 1} a_{j - 1} + \dots + c_k a_{j - (k - i)} = 0$ by $c_i$ and we get that $a_j = - \frac{1}{c_i} ( c_{i + 1} a_{j - 1} + \dots + c_k a_{j - (k - i)})$ , which is our desired recurrence relation. Why is my bound for $j$ different from that given in the proof ( $j > \max \{ k, l \}$ )? Second part: linear recurrence relation (having function $q(n)$ that has its own rational generating function) has a rational generating function This part doesn't make much sense to me at all. I see that $q$ essentially defines a sequence starting at index $k$ , as opposed to zero, so I can see that $q$ could have an associated generating function. However the generating function $g(x)$ given for $q$ is not even a polynomial, much less rational. Is the assumption that $g(x)$ can be expressed in a rational form? I guess $f(x)$ is supposed to be the generating function for the linear recurrence relation? I suppose a linear recurrence relation defines a sequence so there is guaranteed to be an associated generating function. We define the function $h$ in such a way that all its coefficients beyond $k - 1$ are zero. Since $g(x)$ is presumed to be rational, we can write $g(x) = \frac{r(x)}{s(x)}$ where $r$ and $s$ are polynomials, therefore to be more thorough we can write $f(x) = \frac{h(x)s(x) + r(x)}{s(x)(1 - b_1 x - b_2 x^2 - \dots - b_k x^k)}$ . Does what I'm saying about this second part make sense? I am trying to talk myself through it. What is the intuition behind the definition of $h(x)$ ? I guess we're trying to make some kind of finite polynomial and that is the definition that works? I appreciate any help.","I'm trying to understand this lemma from my course notes: It's my understanding that a linear recurrence relation is one of the form for .

I have never heard of a question being directly copied from another Olympiad so this was a first for me. Anyways, first, I looked at the case $y=0$ . This quickly gave me one solution, viz $(x,y,z)=(3,0,3)$ Next, I considered $x,y,z>0$ We know $2^x + 3^y \equiv (-1)^x+0 \bmod 3$ and that perfect squares are $\equiv 0,1 \bmod 3$ . It is easy to see that the only combination that works is $x$ be even and $z=3m+1$ type $\Rightarrow z$ is odd Also, we know that odd perfect squares are $\equiv 1 \bmod 4$ . Further, $3^y\equiv (-1)^y \bmod 4$ and since $x$ is even it implies that $x≥2$ thus $2^x$ is divisible by $4$ . This further implies that $(-1)^y \equiv 1 \bmod 4 \Rightarrow y$ is also even. Let $x=2k$ . Then our original expression becomes $$3^y=(z+2^k)(z-2^k)$$ We have two possibilities: first is that $(z-2^k)=1$ and $(z+2^k)=3^y$ and second is $(z-2^k)=3^{y-a}$ and $(z+2^k)=3^a$ . But since we previously established that $z=3k±1$ and as $2^k \equiv (-1)^y \bmod 3$ , we can quickly discard the second possibility. So we finally have, $$(z-2^k)=1$$ $$(z+2^k)=3^y$$ Here I got woefully stuck. Another thing I got was that $k$ is also even (which means $x$ is itself a multiple of $4$ ). One more thing is that since $y$ is even $3^y$ is divisible by $9$ . I don't know how we can use this fact right now but I thought it could be worth mentioning.

39,How many groups of pentagonal flower bouquets can be formed?,How many groups of pentagonal flower bouquets can be formed?,,"A florist has three types of flowers: tulips, roses, and daisies. There are 4 tulips, 5 roses, and 6 daisies. These 15 flowers are to be arranged into three bouquets of 5 flowers each. Assume that the order of the three bouquets is irrelevant, flowers of the same type are indistinguishable. How many groups of pentagonal bouquets can the florist bundle? Attempt Let us denote tulips, roses, and daisies with T, R, and D, respectively. If we form all 15-letter strings and add dashes after every five letters, we can obtain all possible groups of bouquets. For instance, one possibility would be $$\mathrm{TRRTR-TRDDD-DDTRD}.\tag{ex. 1}$$ There are $\dfrac{15!}{4!\ 5!\ 6!}$ such strings. While, of course, all groups of bouquets can be obtained this way, we are overcounting. For strings, $\mathrm{TRDDD-TRRTR-DDTRD}$ is different from the example above, yet it makes no difference for the group of bouquets since order was assumed to be irrelevant. It might be tempting to divide the number of strings by $3!$ but this would also be incorrect. As an example, $\mathrm{TDDDT-TDDDT-RRRRR}\tag{ex. 2}$ is a valid group of three bouquets that should instead be divided by $\dfrac{3!}{2!} = 3$ . So, one way to proceed is to divide all groups of bouquets into two non-intersecting classes. First those for which all groups of three bouquets are pairwise different, and then those with exactly two matching bouquets out of three. Note that forming groups with three identical bouquets is impossible because 4 tulips cannot be shared equally among three bouquets. Once partitioned in this manner, we may divide the first kind of partition with $3!$ , and the second with $3$ . However, such partitioning seems overly tedious, and is further complicated by the following aspect. We still have to consider that whenever there are at least two different kinds of flowers in a single bouquet, there is a further overcounting with the string-approach. Namely, e.g., the bouquets $$\mathrm{TRDDD\equiv DTRDD\equiv DDTRD\equiv DDDTR\equiv RDDDT}\tag{ex. 3}$$ are all equivalent since they can be transformed into one another by a rotation in space. (So a division with $5$ might additionally be in order for such bouquets). The 'further complication' is then the fact that groups of bouquets which initially seem to warrant division by $3!$ , actually require division with $3$ , as is the case for our first example. Indeed, by ex. 3 we have $\mathrm{TRDDD\equiv DDTRD}$ and so $$\mathrm{TRRTR-TRDDD-DDTRD\equiv TRRTR-TRDDD-TRDDD}$$ which should by divided by $3$ . Clarification from comments : bouquets which can be transformed into one another by reflection are not equivalent, and should be counted as different bouquets. Question The above discussion seems to lead into various subcases where mistakes could be easy to make, and is tedious to generalise. Is there cleaner approach? Regardless, an answer which carefully carries the above scheme to completion has value, too. For the record, the answer I obtain with the above method is $898$ . Edit: I have now also ""confirmed"" the answer $898$ with an independent Python program. Trying to find partitions of the multiset $\{\mathrm{T}:4, \mathrm{N}:5, \mathrm{D}:6\}$ into classes of size five is something that I admittedly have not thought much about, but on the face of it would lead to undercounting, since, for instance, the multiset $\{\mathrm{D, D, R, R, T}\}$ would not differentiate between non-equivalent bouquets $\mathrm{DDRRT}$ and $\mathrm{DTDRR}$ .
