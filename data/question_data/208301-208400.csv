Problem: Consider the the numbers $S=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ . Given $2\le d \le n$ what is the maximal number of permutations $p(d)$ of $S$ you can choose such that the following holds: Whenever   you compare two chosen permutations, they differ in at least $d$ spots? Note that we always have $2\le d\le n$ since two permutations cannot differ in exactly one spot. Note also that $n\le p(d)\le n!$ for all $d:$ $p$ is non-increasing and for $d=n$ one can choose the natural order first and proceed cyclically by writing \begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & \ldots & n-1 & n \\ 2 & 3 & \ldots & n   & 1 \\ \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots \\ n & 1 & \ldots & n-2 & n-1 \\ \end{matrix} so that $p(n) \ge n.$ Actually $p(n)=n$ since when writing the $n$ permutations differing in $n$ spots in pairwise comparisons into the rows of a matrix, the first column will contain all $n$ numbers.

I basically don't understand the way the proof is given in my text as well as some references online. They basically do the same thing. THEOREM : Let $m,x$ be positive integers such that $\gcd(m, x) = 1$ . Then $x$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $m$ , and it is unique, $\mod m $ . Now,  this is a sufficient and  necessary condition, but  let's just look  at the  proof  that it is the sufficient condition which is given in my texts. Proof : Consider the sequence of m numbers $0,x,2x,...,(m−1)x$ . We claim that these are all distinct, $\mod m$ . Since there are only $m$ distinct values modulo $m$ , it must then be the case that $ax = 1 \mod m$ ,  for exactly one $a (\mod m)$ . This a is the unique multiplicative inverse. To verify the above claim, suppose that $ax = bx \mod m$ for two distinct values $a,b$ in the range $0 ≤ a,b ≤ m−1$ . Then we would have $(a−b)x = 0 \mod m$ , or equivalently, $(a−b)x = km$ for some integer $k$ (possibly zero or negative). But since $x$ and $m$ are relatively prime, it follows that $a−b$ must be an integer multiple of $m$ . This is not possible since $a,b$ are distinct non-negative integers less than $m$ . What I don't see particularly in this proof is the connection betweent the $\gcd$ being one and the existence of the multiplicative  inverse. What I do  see instead is that the proof that the multiplicative inverse is  unique.

Question : Each user on a computer system has a password, which is six to eight characters long, where each character is an uppercase letter or digit. Each password must contain at least one digit. How many possible passwords are there? His solution : Let $P$ be the total number of possible passwords, and let $p_6, p_7$ and $p_8$ denote the number of possible passwords of length 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

Case $2$: The last digit is equal to $3$ We have $9$ options for the second last digit. I don't know how to complete this step...

Or else correct me if there was something else in my computation so far that is not correct or could be done easier. Thanks in advance!!!","For my combinatorics course, I have to answer the following question: How many natural numbers smaller than or equal to $10^{23}$ do not contain the pattern $13$? (We consider $0$ as a natural number). I tried to solve this using a recurrence relation: Call $f_n$ the amount of natural numbers smaller than or equal to $10^n$ that do not contain $13$. I considered $2$ cases: Case $1$: The last digit is not equal to $3$ We have $9$ options for chosing this last digit, so $9 \cdot f_{n - 1}$ combinations. Case $2$: The last digit is equal to $3$ We have $9$ options for the second last digit. I don't know how to complete this step... So by now, I know that the recurrence relation is of this form: $f_{n} = 9 \cdot f_{n - 1} + ... + 1$. I added the 1 because $10^n$ is also one of the options. I'm really stuck here, so could you please help me complete case 2 and find the recurrence relation? Or else correct me if there was something else in my computation so far that is not correct or could be done easier. Thanks in advance!!!",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
