37,About the category $\mathrm{Set}(G)$,About the category,\mathrm{Set}(G),"I'm not good with categories. I've attempted several times to understand what a natural transformation is, and so far I've failed. But I'm trying to learn algebraic topology now, and it seems that I have to give it a try. In particular, I need to understand the category of left $G$-sets for a group $G$ because of the classification theorem for covering maps. Of course I know what a $G$-set is, and I know some examples. I know that any set can be made a $G$-set for any group $G$ by defining $$gx=x$$ for all $g\in G$ and $x\in X$. When $X$ and $Y$ are sets of different cardinalities, such $G$-sets are not isomorphic, which means that the isomorphism classes of objects in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ don't form a set. So I'm guessing a classification could be impossible. But I'm wondering if the important examples of $G$-sets are somehow special (maybe definable) in this category. By important examples I mean expecially these: the left coset spaces of subgroups of $G$ (in particular, the homomorphic images of $G$) acted on by multiplication; the normal subgroups of $G$ acted on by conjugation; the power set of $G$ acted on by multiplication. If I haven't put something important on this list, I would like to learn about it too. I would like to know if there's something that characterizes these examples up to isomorphism in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ and whether perhaps there is some (maybe partial) classification or characterization of $G$-sets using these examples.

I've attempted several times to understand what a natural transformation is, and so far I've failed. But I'm trying to learn algebraic topology now, and it seems that I have to give it a try. In particular, I need to understand the category of left $G$-sets for a group $G$ because of the classification theorem for covering maps. Of course I know what a $G$-set is, and I know some examples. I know that any set can be made a $G$-set for any group $G$ by defining $$gx=x$$ for all $g\in G$ and $x\in X$. When $X$ and $Y$ are sets of different cardinalities, such $G$-sets are not isomorphic, which means that the isomorphism classes of objects in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ don't form a set. So I'm guessing a classification could be impossible. But I'm wondering if the important examples of $G$-sets are somehow special (maybe definable) in this category. By important examples I mean expecially these: the left coset spaces of subgroups of $G$ (in particular, the homomorphic images of $G$) acted on by multiplication; the normal subgroups of $G$ acted on by conjugation; the power set of $G$ acted on by multiplication. If I haven't put something important on this list, I would like to learn about it too. I would like to know if there's something that characterizes these examples up to isomorphism in $\mathrm{Set}(G)$ and whether perhaps there is some (maybe partial) classification or characterization of $G$-sets using these examples. For example, something like this would be good: every $G$-set is isomorphic to a left coset space of some subgroup of $G$. This is clearly false, but this is the kind of thing I have in mind.

Care to generalize? The first part of the problem is simple for me; I'm interested in the generalization. For a finite direct product, we can prove that $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} G_{i}$ is isomorphic to the direct product $G_{1} \times \cdots \times  G_{n}$ (with parentheses placed arbitrarily. Suggestions are welcome for formalizing the notation) by induction. But what about the case of $\prod_{i \in I} G_{i}$ , where $I$ is an infinite index set, and $G_{i_{1}} \times \cdots$ (also indexed by $I$ , and with a (possibly) infinite number of arbitrarily placed parentheses)?

The cartesian (or unrestricted direct ) product , $$C=\underset{\lambda\in\Lambda}{{\rm Cr}}\, G_\lambda,$$ is the group whose underlying set is the set product of the $G_\lambda$ s [. . .] and whose group operation is multiplication of components: thus $$(g_\lambda)(h_\lambda)=(g_\lambda h_\lambda),$$ $g_\lambda, h_\lambda\in G_\lambda$ .

On page 56, ibid. , Let $F$ be a free group on a countably infinite set $\{x_1,x_2,\dots\}$ and let $W$ be a nonempty subset of $F$ . If $w=x_{i_1}^{l_1}\dots x_{i_r}^{l_r}\in W$ and $g_1,\dots, g_r$ are elements of a group $G$ , we define the value of the word $w$ at $(g_1,\dots,g_r)$ to be $w(g_1,\dots,g_r)=g_1^{l_1}\dots g_{r}^{l_r}$ . The subgroup of $G$ generated by all values in $G$ of words in $W$ is called the verbal subgroup of $G$ determined by $W$ , $$W(G)=\langle w(g_1,g_2,\dots) \mid g_i\in G, w\in W\rangle.$$ On page 57, ibid. , If $W$ is a set of words in $x_1, x_2, \dots$ and $G$ is any group, a normal subgroup $N$ is said to be $W$ -marginal in $G$ if $$w(g_1,\dots, g_{i-1}, g_ia, g_{i+1},\dots, g_r)=w(g_1,\dots, g_{i-1}, g_i, g_{i+1},\dots, g_r)$$ for all $g_i\in G, a\in N$ and all $w(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_r)$ in $W$ . This is equivalent to the requirement: $g_i\equiv h_i \mod N, (1\le i\le r)$ , always implies that $w(g_1,\dots, g_r)=w(h_1,\dots, h_r)$ . [The] $W$ -marginal subgroups of $G$ generate a normal subgroup which is also $W$ -marginal. This is called the $W$ -marginal of $G$ and is written $$W^*(G).$$ On page 57, ibid. , A [. . .] class of groups $\mathfrak{X}$ is a class - not a set - whose members are groups and which enjoys the following properties: (i) $\mathfrak{X}$ contains a group of order $1$ ; and (ii) $G_1\cong G\in\mathfrak{X}$ always implies $G_1\in\mathfrak{X}$ . [. . .] A group in a class $\mathfrak X$ is called an $\mathfrak X$ -group. On page 58, ibid. , If $W$ is a set of words in $x_1, x_2, \dots $ , the class of all groups $G$ such that $W(G)=1$ , or equivalently $W^*(G)=G$ , is called the variety $\mathfrak{B}(W)$ determined by $W$ . The Question: If $\mathfrak X$ is any class of groups, define ${\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X$ to be the intersection of all varieties that contain $\mathfrak X$ . Prove that ${\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X$ [. . .] consists of all images of subgroups of cartesian products of $\mathfrak X$ -groups. Thoughts: By the first part of the exercise , ${\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X$ is a variety; by the earlier exercise , then, ${\rm Var}\,\mathfrak{X}$ is closed with respect to forming subgroups, images, and subcartesian products; so - I guess - we can conclude $$\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{P}(\mathfrak X)))\subseteq {\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X,\tag{1}$$ where: $\mathbf{H}(\mathfrak{Y})$ means ""homomorphic images of the groups in the class $\mathfrak{Y}$ of groups""; $\mathbf{S}(\mathfrak{Y})$ means ""subgroups of the groups in the class $\mathfrak{Y}$ of groups""; and $\mathbf{P}(\mathfrak{Y})$ means ""products of the groups in the class $\mathfrak{Y}$ of groups"". This notation, I gather, is from universal-algebra . One problem I have here is in ensuring that $\mathbf{K}(\mathfrak Y)$ is a variety for each (relevant) $\mathfrak Y$ and for each (relevant) $\mathbf{K}$ ; another problem is that, wouldn't it be $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{P}({\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X)))\subseteq {\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X$ ? To prove the reverse inclusion of $(1)$ , I guess I could proceed as I would with a set theoretic inclusion: by supposing $G\in {\rm Var}\,\mathfrak X$ with the aim of proving $G\in \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{P}(\mathfrak X)))$ . Nothing springs out at me regarding how to do this, although I suppose I'd have to find a homomorphism $\varphi: G\to S$ (or is it $\psi: S\to G$ ?) for some subgroup $S$ of a product $P$ of $\mathfrak X$ -groups.

Thoughts: By the first part of the exercise , is a variety; by the earlier exercise , then, is closed with respect to forming subgroups, images, and subcartesian products; so - I guess - we can conclude where: means ""homomorphic images of the groups in the class of groups""; means ""subgroups of the groups in the class of groups""; and means ""products of the groups in the class of groups"". This notation, I gather, is from universal-algebra . One problem I have here is in ensuring that is a variety for each (relevant) and for each (relevant) ; another problem is that, wouldn't it be ? To prove the reverse inclusion of , I guess I could proceed as I would with a set theoretic inclusion: by supposing with the aim of proving . Nothing springs out at me regarding how to do this, although I suppose I'd have to find a homomorphism (or is it ?) for some subgroup of a product of -groups.

Idea : Since $G$ is abelian we can rewrite the product $\prod_{a\in G}a = a_1\cdot a_2 \cdot \ldots$ by placing any $a_i$ next to its inverse and they'll cancel out. Then we are only left with all selfinverse elements $u$ . Further I know that there must be an odd number of those elements $u$ , because: the number of elements with order greater than $2$ is even there is one neutral element the order of $G$ is even, because of Lagrange's theorem Question: I'd like to get a hint on how to solve this. Is my progress until now correct or leading to the solution?
