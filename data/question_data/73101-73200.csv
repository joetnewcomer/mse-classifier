1,The real projective space $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ is the adjunction space $D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1}$.,The real projective space  is the adjunction space .,\mathbb{R}P^{2} D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1},"I would like to show that the 2-dimensional real projective space $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ is homeomorphic to the adjunction space $D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1}$ where $f : S^{1} \longrightarrow S^{1}$ is the function given by $f(z) = z^{2}$ (considering $S^{1}$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{C}$ ). I know this question has already been asked here , but no one gave a complete answer for it. This is a quite important fact for calculating the homology groups of $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ so I would like to have a rigorous proof of it. My attempt: 1) Considering $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ as the quotient space $D^{2}/\sim$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary $S^{1}$ of $D^{2}$ , I tried to construct first a function from the disjoint union $D^{2} \amalg S^{1}$ into $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ by defining two continuous functions $g : D^{2} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ and $ h : S^{1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ given by $g(z) = [ z^{2} ]$ and $h(z) = [z]$ (where the brackets [ ] denote the equivalence class of an element of $D^{2}$ in the quotient space $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ ). 2) Then, it's easy to see that the continuous function $F : D^{2}\amalg S^{1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ given by $F(x) = g(x)$ for $x$ in the copy of $D^{2}$ in the disjoint union $D^{2}\amalg S^{1}$ and $F(x) = h(x)$ for $x$ in the copy of $S^{1}$ in the disjoint union $D^{2}\amalg S^{1}$ is constant on the fibers of the quotient map $p : D^{2}\amalg S^{1} \longrightarrow D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1}$ , so we obtain a continuous function $G : D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ such that $G \circ p = F$ . 3)Since $D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1}$ is compact and $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ is Hausdorff, $G$ would be the desired homeomoprhism if it was bijective, but if we take two antipodal points $x$ and $-x$ in the copy of $S^{1}$ in the disjoint union $D^{2} \amalg S^{1}$ , then these two points are not equivalent in the adjunction space $D^{2} \cup_{f} S^{1}$ , so that $p(x) \neq p(-x)$ , but, by definition of the relation $\sim$ on $D^{2}$ used to obtain $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ , we have that $G(p(x)) = F(x) = h(x) = [x] = [-x] = h(-x) = F(-x) = G(p(-x))$ , showing that $G$ is not injective. I tried to modify my original functions $g : D^{2} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ and $ h : S^{1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}P^{2}$ to fix this issue without any success. Am I in the right direction or should I try something different? By the way, I can use any of the equivalent definitions of $\mathbb{R}P^{2}$ (by identifying lines through the origin in $R^{3} \setminus \{0\}$ , antipodal points in $S^{2}$ or antipodal points in the boundary of $D^{2}$ as I did in my attempt).

But I do not see how that works, by taking complements in the statement of Theorem 5.6, I can only have that Theorem 5.6 is equivalent to the statement: If X is a complete metric space, $\{A_i\}$ is a countable collection of nowhere dense closed subsets of X, then int$(\cup A_i)=\emptyset$.(3) (Or see corollary to baire category theorem ) Of course, (3) or (1) implies (2), but I don't know how to prove that (2) implies (1) or (3). I also know that Theorem 5.6 is equivalent to the statement: If X is a complete metric space, then every non empty open subset of X is of second category.(4) (See About the equivalence of definitions of a Baire Space ) But I do not see this would be helpful.

95,Complement of a Component is Connected,Complement of a Component is Connected,,"Given: $X$ is locally connected, $C \subseteq X$ is closed and connected, $U$ is a component of $X \backslash C$. I want to show that $X \backslash U$ is connected. Here's what I know: $C$ is closed $\implies X \backslash C$ is open $\implies U$ is open since $X$ is locally connected $\implies X \backslash U$ is closed. If I suppose that $X \backslash U$ is disconnected, then there are disjoint closed sets $V,W$ so that $X \backslash U \subseteq V \cup W$. Since $U$ is merely one component of $X \backslash C$, we have $X \backslash C = U \cup \bigcup U_\alpha$ where each $U_\alpha$ is a component of $X \backslash C$. Then $X \backslash U = C \cup \bigcup U_\alpha$. I would just like some direction on where to go from here to arrive at a contradiction.","Given: $X$ is locally connected, $C \subseteq X$ is closed and connected, $U$ is a component of $X \backslash C$.

I see it claimed without proof in many places that $O_n$ is a maximal compact subgroup.
