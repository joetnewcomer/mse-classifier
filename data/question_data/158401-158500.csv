How to solve this? I couldn't find official solution, only couple of posts on AoPS with no complete solution, such as aops1 and aops2 . Some examples of $(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$ found there are $$ (2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35),\\ (2,3,4,6,7,9,12,14,21,36,45,60),\\ (2,3,4,5,8,10,15,20,24,30,40,60,120) $$ Since $\sum_{i=3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i^2}<\frac{1}{2}$ , we know $\frac{1}{2^2}$ will be always in the sum. Also multiplying out $(1)$ to get rid of fractions and inspecting modulo $x_i^2$ , we see $2(x_1\cdots x_{i-1}x_{i+1}\cdots x_n)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{x_i^2}$ , so divisors of each of $x_i$ must ""split"" among other $x_j$ 's (and $2$ ), but I don't think that helps much. Edit: As noted by WhatsUp in comments, there is relevant problem in Project Euler. There is actually also one that is almost identical, but with limited search range, specifically https://projecteuler.net/problem=152 . So it might help to think about this problem in similar manner, letting $x_n \leq M$ and then characterize solutions with these constrains. Caution, the following spoils the above mentioned Project Euler problem. We can convert this to more computationally manageable diophantine equation by multiplying $(1)$ by $2\text{lcm}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)^2$ instead of $2(x_1x_2\cdots x_n)^2$ . For example considering $\text{lcm}(2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35)=420$ , first example can be written as $$420^2=2(210^2+140^2+105^2+84^2+60^2+35^2+28^2+21^2+15^2+12^2).$$ Then by the construction, all the squares on the right are divisors of the square on the left. Also, square on the left is just square of one of divisors of $\text{lcm} (2,3,\dots,M)$ , if we have $M \geq 35$ . This leads to following reformulation of the problem: Find all sequences $y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n$ of distinct positive integers such that $$m^2=2(y_1^2+y_2^2+\dots+y_n^2)\tag{2},$$ where $m=\text{lcm}(y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n)$ . So in principle, for fixed $M$ and $x_i \leq M$ , we can find $\text{lcm}(2,3,\dots,M)$ , and then enumerate its divisors effectively using prime factorization (using that its prime factors will be $p \leq M$ ). Then additionally, we can notice that not all primes $p$ can be present in these numbers. Indeed, if we have $p> M/2$ , then by earlier observation, it would have to divide at least two $x_i$ 's. Smallest of them can be $x_i=p$ , with next smallest $x_j=2p>M$ , impossible. In similar way, lots of other primes can be ruled out for $M=80$ , by realizing they would require to be split among at least $3$ of $x_i$ 's (try $37$ ).

6,Find Harmonic Numbers for Imaginary and Complex Values,Find Harmonic Numbers for Imaginary and Complex Values,,"The Normal definition of Harmonic numbers with $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ is $$ H_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k} \tag{1}\label{eq1A} $$ This can be expanded to $ n \in \mathbb{C} $ $$ H_n = \psi_0(n+1) + \gamma \tag{2}\label{eq2A}$$ Where $\psi_0(n)$ is the $0$ th degree Polygamma function, which is defined for complex values of n, and $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. So my question is there a general solution to $H_{ji}$ where $j \in \mathbb{N}  $ and $i$ is the imaginary unit? I considered in using the series formula of the Polygamma which is $$ \psi_0(z+1) = -\gamma + \sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+z}) \tag{3}\label{eq3A}$$ Simplify the $(2)$ with $(3)$ we get $$ H_{ji} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+ji}) \tag{4}\label{eq4A}$$ But I don't know how to simplify this series. I tried to use the function above and Wolfram Alpha just simplifies it back to $\psi_0(x+1) + \gamma $ so this type of method seems to just be dead end. Another method I have considered is the integral representation of $\psi_0(z)$ which is $$ \psi_0(z) = \int_0^\infty (e^{-t}-\frac{1}{(1+t)^z})\frac{dt}{t} \tag{5}\label{eq5A}$$ Which transforms our $(2)$ into $$ H_{ji} = \int_0^\infty (e^{-t}-{(1+t)^{-ji+1}})\frac{dt}{t} + \gamma \tag{6}\label{eq6A}$$ Expanding the integral int $(6)$ we get $$ H_{ji} = \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t}}{t}dt - \int_0^\infty \frac{(1+t)^{-ji+1}}{t}dt + \gamma \tag{7}\label{e71A}$$ Which is just $$ H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_0^\infty \frac{(1+t)^{-ji+1}}{t}dt +\gamma \tag{8}\label{eq8A}$$ Where $ \Gamma(z) $ is the Gamma function . Seeing that $ \lim_{z\to 0} \Gamma(z) \rightarrow \infty $ and that the second integral doesn't converge there has to be some type of manipulation for $\Gamma(0)$ and the second integral to get a value of $H_{ji}$ . You can also use the identity of $ \psi(z+1) = \psi(z)+\frac{1}{z} $ to obtain for the previous function as $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(1+t)^{ji}t}dt - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma\tag{9}\label{eq9A}$$ Letting $ 1+t = u $ we can see our $(9)$ will change to $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u^{ji}(u-1)}du - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma \tag{10}\label{eq10A}$$ Doing partial fraction decomposition of $ \frac{1}{u^{ji}(u-1)} = \frac{A}{u^{ji}}+\frac{B}{u-1} $ we see that $$ A = -1 \\  B = 1^{1-ji} \tag{11}\label{eq11A}$$ Expanding our $(10)$ with $(11)$ we get $$H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty (\frac{1^{1-ji}}{u-1} - \frac{1}{u^{ji}})du - \frac{i}{j} +\gamma \tag{12}\label{eq12A}$$ Constructing $(12)$ into two integrals and simpifying we see find $$ H_{ji} = \Gamma(0) - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u-1} du - \int_1^\infty \frac{1}{u^{ji}} du - \frac{i}{j} + \gamma \tag{13}\label{eq13A}$$ But it is obvious that these two integrals don't converge to any value, so it seems that the partial fraction decomposition is also a dead end. Thanks to @AliShather, they noticed that the integral in $(8)$ is very closly related to the Beta function , where the beta function is $$ B(x,y) = \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{x-1}}{(1+t)^{x+y}}dt = \frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)} \Re\{x,y\}>0 \tag{14}\label{eq14A}$$ Comparing this to the integral in $(8)$ we can see that $\Re\{x,y\} \ngtr 0$ , but very close!

I first came across this topic when reading the book $\textit{Fermat's Last Theorem. A Genetic Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory}$ . After a brief search for details of Lamé's proof, I found in What was Lame's proof? the steps he followed, but, even in its fault, it does not work if $n=3$ , as the author himself claimed, in $x^n+y^n=z^n$ , the equation in Fermat's Last Theorem statement. I found that the result for $n=3$ was already proven to be true at the time, thanks only to the factorization of the left member of the equation, so Lamé did not actually needed to prove it. However, in many other sources, it is stated that there is a different proof which exploits the infinite descent method, like the one Lamé employed, but no one gives details about that. The closest I came was in some notes related to a course of algebraic number theory. They stated that, working in $\mathbb{Z}[j]$ , where $ j=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{3} $ is a 3rd-root of the unity in the complex field, $x^3 + y^3 = z^3$ can be rewritten as follows: $$ \left( \frac{x}{z} \right)^3 -1 = - \left( \frac{y}{z} \right)^3. \tag{1} \label{1} $$ So, by using $$X^3-1 = (X - 1)(X^2 + X + 1) = (X - 1)(X - j)(X - j^2),$$ and multiplyng by $z^3$ in $(\ref{1})$ , it ensues that: $$ (x - z)(x - jz)(x -j^2z) = -y^3. $$ Unfortunately, the notes ended by claiming that, from this identity, Lamé concluded by infinite descent using the additional fact that, if the product of three coprime integers is a cube, then each of the factor can be written as a cube. Here, the three coprime elements should be $ (x - z)$ , $(x - jz)$ and $(x -j^2z)$ .

-1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \end{array} \right), $$  or x^4 + (-w + (-y - z))*x^3 + (w^2 + (-3*y + 2*z)*w + (y^2 + 2*z*y + z^2))*x^2 + (-w^3 + (2*y + 2*z)*w^2 + (2*y^2 - z*y - 3*z^2)*w + (-y^3 - 3*z*y^2 +

==================","My last question on this was a bit of a dud. I would, at least, like confirmation that the polynomial $f$ below does, in fact, integrally represent all primes $p \equiv 1 \pmod 5,$ along with all squared primes $q^2$ when prime $q \equiv 4 \pmod 5.$ It is easy to show that the polynomial represents the product of any two numbers it represents. It is not hard to show that, for any represented number, we can adjust the quadruple $(w,x,y,z)$ so that $w,x,y,z \geq 0.$ If possible, confirm that all represented numbers (with $\gcd(w,x,y,z) = 1$  ) are the product of such primes (including $5$ itself) and such squares. Let me find some jpegs... In this $f$ I am going to demand $\gcd(w,x,y,z) = 1.$ $$ f(w,x,y,z) = \det( w I + x A + y A^2 + z A^3),  $$ where $$ A = \left( \begin{array}{rrrr} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\

After we sieve the number $2$, the sequence becomes: $$1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1...$$ We can easily see a pattern here: it's just $1, 0$ repeated ad infinitum. The pattern's length is $2$. After we sieve the number $3$, the sequence becomes: $$2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0...$$ It's clear that we just repeat $2,0,1,1,1,0$, a pattern whose length is $6$.

It however expands for $7, 8, 9$ and again it doesn't for $10$.

After we sieve the number $2$, the sequence becomes: $$1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1...$$ We can easily see a pattern here: it's just $1, 0$ repeated ad infinitum. The pattern's length is $2$. After we sieve the number $3$, the sequence becomes: $$2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0...$$ It's clear that we just repeat $2,0,1,1,1,0$, a pattern whose length is $6$.

A natural number $n$ has nilpotent factorization if $\ell\not\equiv1$ mod $q$ for any two prime powers $\ell$ and $q$ dividing $n$. We know that a natural is nilpotent if and only if it has nilpotent factorization. Based on the folklore ""almost all finite groups are $2$-groups"" (which in particular means they are $p$-groups, which in particular means they are nilpotent), we might expect that nilpotent numbers have arithmetic density $1$, since otherwise nonnilpotent groups would have positive arithmetic density contrary to established belief. A little bit of data agrees with this idea. Yet even if the ""nilpotent number counting function"" $N(x)$ satisfies $N(x)\sim x$, it wouldn't automatically mean ""almost all finite groups are nilpotent,"" since we would also have to bound the number of ways that $p$-groups can be put together other than direct products for nonnilpotent $n$, and so we might reasonably expect $N(x)\sim x$ to be easier to prove than ""almost all finite groups are nilpotent,"" and it seems like it would be amenable to pure number theory.
