This is because I already know the basic concepts of set theory and high school calculus.

My problem is how to define trigonometric functions before I even start the study of derivatives, integrals or power series. In this I'm thinking of a definition analytically, meaning without appealing to geometry other than intuitively. The reason I'm trying to do this is because in the study of derivatives or integrals they use a lot of examples including real functions without they being previously defined, which makes me feel a little uncomfortable. One way to get around this is probably by just thinking of those functions axiomatically, meaning they will be defined at some point later and meanwhile they have certain properties that I can use to find derivatives and integrals, but still I wanted to know the elementary way to accomplish this.","Let's say I want to study real analysis in a self-contained fashion by starting with the axioms of the real numbers.

The black half circles are actually a target, so there are multiple rings nested inside each other. Also, I initially posted this question on stackoverflow as a programming issue. Feel free to read it for more information about the code behind my imfindcircles() solution and my attempted alternative. However, there are quite a few votes to close it. I'm guessing that is because it is really more of a math problem than a programming problem. My Solution I have written a short tutorial about how I solved the problem and posted all my code to github. See the tutorial and code. The tutorial was written in the projects README.md file so it should appear when you view the github page and scroll down a bit. I used the math @vadim123 suggested.",,"['trigonometry', 'circles', 'image-processing']"

After a few attempts, I successfully came up with a solution as follows: $$\tan^2a - 2 \tan^2b = 1$$ $$(\sec^2a - 1) - 2(\sec^2b - 1) = 1$$ $$\sec^2a - 2sec^2b = 0$$ $$\frac{1}{\cos^2a} - \frac{2}{\cos^2b} = 0$$ $$\cos^2b - 2\cos^2a= 0$$ $$(1-\sin^2b) - (1 - \sin^2a) - \cos^2a = 0$$ $$\sin^2a - \cos^2a + \sin^2b = 0$$ $$\cos2a + \sin^2b = 0$$ And the proof is finished. However, before I found this solution, I came up with something like this: $$\tan^2a - 2 \tan^2b = 1$$ $$\frac{\sin^2a}{\cos^2a} - 2\frac{\sin^2b}{\cos^2b} = 1$$ $$\sin^2a\cos^2b - 2\sin^2b\cos^2a - \cos^2a\cos^2b = 0$$ I wanted to extract the $\cos2a $ here.  So I do the following $$(\sin^2a - \cos^2a) \cos^2b - 2\sin^2b\cos^2a = 0$$ $$\cos2a + \frac{2\sin^2b\cos^2a}{\cos^2b} = 0$$ It suffices to show that $$\frac{2\sin^2b\cos^2a}{\cos^2b} = \sin^2b$$ which is equalvalent as saying $$\frac{\cos^2a}{\cos^2b} = \frac{1}{2}$$ Therefore, I looked at the original equation and proved that it is true like this: $$\tan^2a - 2 \tan^2b = 1$$ $$(\sec^2a - 1) - 2(\sec^2b - 1) = 1$$ $$\sec^2a = 2sec^2b$$ $$\frac{\cos^2a}{\cos^2b} = \frac{1}{2}$$ My confusion is the reason why I need to look at the orginal equation again to finish the proof. $\tan^2a - 2 \tan^2b = 1$ is identical to $\cos2a + \sin^2b = 0$ . And I didn't lose information during my proof. Shouldn't I be able to finish the proof directly like my first proof? It may sounds like a strange question.

87,Solve trigonometric equation $ \cos x - x \sin x=0 $,Solve trigonometric equation, \cos x - x \sin x=0 ,"I've been studying trigonometric functions lately and there's one problem I didn't manage to solve. It states that f is a function defined as following: $$ f : \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R $$ $$     x  \mapsto x\cos x $$ I'm supposed to find the smallest extremum of that function, therefore I calculated the derivative which is: $$ f'(x) = \cos x - x\sin x $$ So, in order to find the extremum, we know that we should solve for x the equation f'(x)=0 the thing that I was unable to do. In an attempt to simplify that equation, I obtained $ \cos x= \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} $ which just got the things more complicated. Using a graph calculator, I found out that the point I'm looking for had the coordinates (0.8603, 0.6522) but I still didn't know which path is to be taken in order to get to that result. Can you please help me? And it would be awesome if you give me a general method of solving these kinds of equations.","I've been studying trigonometric functions lately and there's one problem I didn't manage to solve.
