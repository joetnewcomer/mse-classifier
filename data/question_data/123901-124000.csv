Recall that abelian group theory consists of two primitive symbols: $\cdot$ which is a binary function symbol, and $e$ which is a constant. The axioms are: ( $G_1$ ) $\forall x \forall y \forall z \ \ x\cdot (y\cdot z)=(x\cdot y)\cdot z$ ( $G_2$ ) $\forall x \ \ x\cdot e=x$ ( $G_3$ ) $\forall x \exists y \ \ x\cdot y=e$ ( $G_4$ ) $\forall x \forall y \ \ x\cdot y =y \cdot x$ A set of axioms $\Phi$ is independent if for every $\varphi\in \Phi$ there exists an interpretation $\mathcal{I}$ such that $\mathcal{I} \models \Phi\setminus \{\varphi\}$ and $\mathcal{I}\not\models \varphi$ . In non-formal logic language, $\mathcal{I}\models \Phi$ means: exhibit a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ and an element $e\in G$ such that all axioms in $\Phi$ are satisfied (taking the variables as belonging to $G$ ). So, to prove that the above axioms are independent is to exhibit, for every $i=1,\dots,4$ , a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ and an element $e\in G$ such that $(G_j)$ holds for every $j\not=i$ , and $(G_i)$ does not hold. Thusly you prove that you can't prove $(G_i)$ from $\{(G_j), j\not=i\}$ . A cute and fun problem in Ebbinghaus, Mathematical Logic (exercise 4.14, p. 39) asks us to prove that the group theory axioms, i.e. $\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3)\}$ is an independent set of axioms. This is fun to do. But then the natural follow-up question that occurred to me is: is $\{(G_1), (G_2), (G_3) ,(G_4)\}$ an independent set of axioms?

But for $i=1$ I'm having a really hard time. I tried a lot of examples, neither of which works. To sum up, I'm trying to prove that: There exists a set $G$ with a binary operation $\cdot$ such that: $\cdot$ is not associative, $\cdot$ is commutative, there is an identity element $e$ , and every element has an inverse with respect to $e$ . The best I could do was the following. Take $G=\mathbb{R}^2$ , with $(a,b)\cdot (c,d)=(ac+bd,0)$ . It is commutative, not associative, the inverse with respect to $(0,0)$ is $(b,-a)$ , but $(a,b)\cdot (0,0)=(0,0)$ , not $(a,b)$ , whence $(0,0)$ is not an identity element.

For example, $\Bbb Z_1$ , $\Bbb Z_2$ , and $S_3$ are the automorphism groups of the complete graphs $K_1, K_2$ , $K_3$ , respectively, $\Bbb Z_2 \times \Bbb Z_2$ is the automorphism group of , $\Bbb Z_3$ is the automorphism group of the $9$ -vertex graph , $\Bbb Z_4$ and $\Bbb Z_5$ are respectively the automorphism groups of the $12$ - and $15$ -vertex analogues of that graph given (informally) by replacing the central triangle with a square or pentagon, $\Bbb Z_6$ is the automorphism group of the $12$ -vertex graph , and $\Bbb Z_7$ , $\Bbb Z_8$ , and $\Bbb Z_9$ are the respectively the automorphism groups of the $14$ -, $16$ -, and $18$ -vertex analogues of that graph given by replacing the hexagons with heptagons, octagons, and nonagons.

One can modify without much fuss the above examples to produce graphs with automorphism groups the abelian groups in this list, but it is not so clear (to me) to see how to construct a reasonably small graph with automorphism group $Q_8$ : What is the minimal number of vertices of a graph $\Gamma$ for which $\text{Aut}(\Gamma) \cong Q_8$ ? What is an example of such a graph that achieves this minimum? Among such graphs, which has (have) the minimal number of edges?

(I expect that $16$ is also the minimum achievable.) One can attempt to solve this by exploiting a constructive proof of Frucht's Theorem: Roughly, one starts with a Cayley graph of $G$ (which is directed and colored according to generator), which has automorphism group (of directed, colored graphs) $G$ . Then, one replaces each edge with a suitable (undirected) graph, choosing a different replacement graph for each generator, to avoid introducing new symmetries. It is not clear, however, that this approach can produce a graph with $\leq 16$ vertices and automorphism group $Q_8$ . The simplest Cayley graph of $Q_8$ is , but this already has $16$ edges, and it's hard to see how one could suitably replace them without added more than $8$ new vertices in total. This answer , by the way, gives a graph with $32$ vertices with automorphism group $Q_8$ (acting with $4$ orbits on the graph): . Incidentally, one can use the above approach to improve upon this result, i.e., construct a graph $\Gamma$ with $< 32$ vertices and automorphism group $Q_8$ : Let $S(p, q)$ denote the graph with three vertices $a, b, c$ , $p$ edges between $a$ and $b$ , and $q$ edges between $b$ and $c$ .

My problem is showing that $G$ is abelian, and I would be glad if someone could show me how.

First: The center $Z(G)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ so by Lagrange's theorem, if $Z(G)$ has anything other than the identity, it's size is either $p$ or $p^2$ . If $p^2$ then $Z(G)=G$ and we are done.

I wanted to find counter-examples, e.g. a simple group of order something like 2^4 3^2 11^5 13^9 but it seems like they do not exist (unless it slipped past me!).

Recall some basic facts: If $p$ is a prime number, then any group $G$ of order $p^2$ is abelian. Sketch of proof: Fix a prime $p$ and such a group $G$ .  The center $Z(G)$ of $G$ must be nontrivial by the class equation, and hence have order $p$ or $p^2$ .  So $G/Z(G)$ has order $p$ or $1$ .  So $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic.  So $G$ is abelian. If $p < q$ are prime numbers, then there is a nonabelian group of order $pq$ if and only if $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ , and in this case there is only one such nonabelian group (up to isomorphism). Sketch of proof: Fix primes $p < q$ and a group $G$ of order $pq$ .  Use Sylow theory to conclude that $G$ has a unique (and hence normal) subgroup $H_q$ of order $q$ , and a subgroup $H_p$ of order $p$ , and use elementary observations to verify that $H_q \cap H_p = \{1\}$ and $G = H_q H_p$ so that $G$ is some semidirect product $H_q \rtimes H_p$ .  Since $H_q$ is cyclic, $|\operatorname{Aut}(H_q)| = q-1$ , and so when $q \not\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ , Lagrange's theorem shows that there are no nontrivial homomorphisms $H_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(H_q)$ , implying that $G$ is abelian in this case.  When $q = 1 \pmod{p}$ , the existence of a nontrivial homomorphisms $H_p \to \operatorname{Aut}(H_q)$ and the independence of the structure of the resulting semidirect product on the choice of nontrivial homomorphism are discussed in this math.SE post . Together, these facts imply: There are no nonabelian groups of odd order less than $21$ .

(One can think of this as a form of ""nonlinear Morita equivalence"".) What can be said about $G$ and $H$? I suspect that $G$ and $H$ have to be isomorphic, but I can't prove it. If this is too hard in general, I'm also interested in the case that $G$ and $H$ are assumed to be finite. Here are some things I've tried: Since $G$-modules are the abelian group objects in $G\textrm{-}\mathbf{Set}$, we get a Morita equivalence between $\Bbb{Z}[G]$ and $\Bbb{Z}[H]$. So if we tensor with any field $k$, we get a Morita equivalence between $k[G]$ and $k[H]$. Assume for a moment that $G$ and $H$ are finite. If we take $k = \Bbb{C}$, then this means that $G$ and $H$ have the same number of irreducible representations, so the same number of conjugacy classes. If we take $k=\Bbb{R}, \Bbb{Q}, \overline{\Bbb{F}_p}$, we also get the same number of real, rational and $p$-regular conjugacy classes. While this approach gives some common properties between $G$ and $H$, it's not possible to conclude that $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, because there are known examples of non-isomorphic finite groups with isomorphic integral group algebras.

67,How big must the union of a group's Sylow p-subgroups be?,How big must the union of a group's Sylow p-subgroups be?,,"For various orders $n$ it's a common exercise to prove that a finite group $G$ of order $n$ can't be simple by using the Sylow theorems to show that there is some prime $p \mid n$ such that the number $n_p$ of Sylow $p$ -subgroups equals $1$ , so the unique Sylow $p$ -subgroup is normal. One way these proofs can go is that you show that if $n_p$ isn't equal to $1$ , then because $n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p$ it must be very large, so large that there isn't enough room in $G$ for all of its Sylow $p$ -subgroups together plus the other Sylow subgroups. I know how to run this argument if the exponent $a$ of $p$ in $n$ is $1$ and we can show that $n_p = \frac{n}{p}$ ; in this case the Sylow $p$ -subgroups are cyclic, so intersect only in the identity, which means that $G$ has at least $\frac{n}{p}(p - 1)$ elements of order $p$ , and hence only room for $\frac{n}{p}$ elements of other orders. However, I don't know how to run this argument if $a \ge 2$ ; this came up when I was trying to answer this question and specifically trying to show that a group of order $|G| = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2 = 735$ can't be simple. The Sylow theorems give that if $n_7 \neq 1$ then $n_7 = 15$ , so $G$ has the maximum possible number of Sylow $7$ -subgroups. The specific question this gave rise to is: Specific question: What is the sharpest lower bound on the size of the union of these $15$ Sylow $7$ -subgroups? I wanted to use the Bonferroni inequalities to address this question, using the fact that any two Sylow $7$ -subgroups intersect in at most $7$ elements, but something very funny happened: if I apply Bonferroni to all $15$ subgroups I get a lower bound of $$15 \cdot 49 - {15 \choose 2} \cdot 7 = 0.$$ The problem is that there are too many pairwise intersections between $15$ subgroups. If I instead apply Bonferroni with only $k$ of the $15$ subgroups I get a lower bound of $$49k - 7 {k \choose 2}$$ which turns out to be maximized when $k = 8$ , giving a lower bound of $210$ . Is it possible to do better than this? I'm ignoring $7$ of the Sylows! So the general question is: General question: What is the sharpest lower bound on the size of the union of the Sylow $p$ -subgroups of a finite group $G$ which can be written as a function of the size $p^a$ of such a subgroup and the number $n_p$ of such subgroups? What if $G$ is assumed to be simple? When $a = 1$ the union has size exactly $(p - 1) n_p + 1$ . In general any two Sylows intersect in at most $p^{a-1}$ elements, so Bonferroni with $k$ of the Sylows gives a lower bound of $$k p^a - {k \choose 2} p^{a-1} = k p^{a-1} \left( p - \frac{k-1}{2} \right)$$ which is maximized when $k \approx p$ as above (or $k = n_p$ , if $p$ is more than a little larger than $n_p$ ). But the smaller $p$ is compared to $n_p$ the less helpful of a bound this will be.","For various orders it's a common exercise to prove that a finite group of order can't be simple by using the Sylow theorems to show that there is some prime such that the number of Sylow -subgroups equals , so the unique Sylow -subgroup is normal.

Theorem A. If $L$ is a locally cyclic group with no element of order $2$ , then $L$ cannot be expressed as an automorphism group. But how about $(\mathbb{R},+)$ ? I think the answer might be no , and the proof proceeds by showing that if $\mathrm{Aut}(G) \simeq \mathbb{R}$ , then some subgroup or quotient $H$ of $G$ will satisfy $\mathrm{Aut}(G) \simeq \mathbb{Q}$ , which contradicts Theorem A. So how can we construct this $H$ ? Assuming the axiom of choice, we can say $\mathbb{R} = \mathbb{Q}\oplus B$ for some additive subgroup $B$ of $\mathbb{R}$ (just by picking a $\mathbb{Q}$ -basis for $\mathbb{R}$ ).

79,Elementary problems with group theoretic solutions,Elementary problems with group theoretic solutions,,"I am helping a friend develop a course in abstract algebra that is designed for high school students who have no knowledge of abstract algebra or any real exposure to formally rigorous mathematics. To motivate the study, we are seeking problems whose statement will be immediately accessible to the students, but whose solution is aided by basic tools of group theory. So my question is this: What are some interesting problems, whose statements are comprehensible to an average 9th or 10th grade high school student, but whose solutions are greatly aided by group theory? Here is the best type of example I have thought of so far for what we are looking for: How many distinct ways are there to 2-color the 8 vertices of a cube, with colorings only considered distinct up to rotation? The problem is very tricky by direct enumeration (how do you know when you're done?) but submits to a double-counting method based on the orbit-stabilizer theorem. This is perfect because the question is natural and kids could get started by direct enumeration; but the group theory really adds a lot of power. Also, the type of group theory needed is at the right level: Lagrange's theorem and its corollary the orbit-stabilizer theorem. These are significant pieces of theory but are realistic to get to in this setting.

Thanks again.","I am helping a friend develop a course in abstract algebra that is designed for high school students who have no knowledge of abstract algebra or any real exposure to formally rigorous mathematics. To motivate the study, we are seeking problems whose statement will be immediately accessible to the students, but whose solution is aided by basic tools of group theory. So my question is this: What are some interesting problems, whose statements are comprehensible to an average 9th or 10th grade high school student, but whose solutions are greatly aided by group theory? Here is the best type of example I have thought of so far for what we are looking for: How many distinct ways are there to 2-color the 8 vertices of a cube, with colorings only considered distinct up to rotation? The problem is very tricky by direct enumeration (how do you know when you're done?) but submits to a double-counting method based on the orbit-stabilizer theorem. This is perfect because the question is natural and kids could get started by direct enumeration; but the group theory really adds a lot of power. Also, the type of group theory needed is at the right level: Lagrange's theorem and its corollary the orbit-stabilizer theorem. These are significant pieces of theory but are realistic to get to in this setting.
