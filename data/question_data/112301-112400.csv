I have trouble seeing why the proof (as explained below) settles the uniqueness part. The proof (as I understand it) goes as follows: First we show existence of the subgroup $H$, given any choice of a divisor $d$ of $n$. So suppose $n = dm$. Obviously, one can construct a surjective homomorphism $f : \mathbb{Z} \to G$, and it is also clear that $f(m\mathbb{Z}) \subset G$ is a subgroup of $G$. The resulting isomorphism $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \cong G/f(m\mathbb{Z})$ leads us to conclude that the index of $f(m\mathbb{Z})$ in $G$ is $m$ and so the order of $f(m\mathbb{Z})$ must be $d$. Ok, so we have shown that a subgroup having order $d$ exists. The second part is then to show uniqueness - and here is where I am lost as I don't understand why the following argument serves this end: Suppose $H$ is any subgroup of order $d$. Looking at the inverse image of $f^{-1}(H)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ we know it must be of the form $k\mathbb{Z}$ for some positive integer $k$ (since all non - trivial subgroups in $\mathbb{Z}$ can be written in this form). Now $H = f(k\mathbb{Z})$ has order $d$, and $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z} \cong G/H$, where the group on the right hand side has order $n/d = m$. From this isomorphism we can therefore conclude that $k = m$. Here Lang ends by saying "".. and H is uniquely determined"". But why is this ? Does he mean uniquely determined up to isomorphism ? Because, what I think I have shown is that any subgroup of order $d$ must be isomorphic to $m\mathbb{Z}$ - yet this gives me uniqueness only up to isomorphism.. what am I missing ?

Let $G$ be a group of order $72$ ; $o(G) = 2^{3}3^{2}$ . How many $3$ -Sylow subgroups can there be in $G$ ? If this number is $t$ , then, according to Theorem $2.12.3$ , $t = 1 + 3k$ . According to Lemma $2.12.5$ , $t \mid 72$ , and since $t$ is prime to $3$ , we must have $t \mid 8$ . The only factors of $8$ of the form $1 + 3k$ are $1$ and $4$ ; hence $t = 1$ or $t = 4$ are the only possibilities. In other words $G$ has either one $3$ -Sylow subgroup or $4$ such. $\;$ If $G$ has only one $3$ -Sylow subgroup, since all $3$ -Sylow subgroups are conjugate, this $3$ -Sylow subgroup must be normal in $G$ . In this case $G$ would certainly contain a nontrivial normal subgroup. On the other hand if the number of $3$ -Sylow subgroups of $G$ is $4$ , by Lemma $2.12.5$ the index of $N$ in $G$ is $4$ , where $N$ is the normalizer of a $3$ -Sylow subgroup.

I recently encountered a problem in which I had to prove that for any natural number $n$ bigger or equal than $3$ , there exists a finite non-abelian group with an exponent equal to $n$ . The first rule I discovered was that if two groups the have exponents, say, $a_1$ and $a_2$ ,then the direct product of these groups has an exponent of $\operatorname{lcm}(a_1,a_2)$ (least common multiple), meaning that if $a_1$ and $a_2$ belong to our list of numbers then so does $\operatorname{lcm}(a_1,a_2)$ ; $(1)$ The second thing I did was prove that if $n$ is an odd prime number, then there exists a finite non-abelian group with exponent $n$ . The proof is by example: I took all upper triangular 3x3 matrices with numbers from $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (the residue class modulo $p$ ) with only $1$ 's on the diagonal. I then proved that any such matrix raised to the power $p$ is equal to the identity $I_3$ . Since $p$ is prime, $p$ is the smallest power for which this is true, and therefore $p$ is the exponent of the group; $(2)$ The third thing I did was to use $(1)$ and $(2)$ to prove that it works for any square-free odd integer. I then realized that if you take the direct product of an abelian and a non-abelian group, then the result is non-abelian.

(Check my work please),\mathbb{Z},"I am just starting out with semi-direct products. I would like to list and describe the semi-direct products of $\mathbb{Z}$ with itself. I first need to find the automorphisms $\varphi$ from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ . These automorphisms are determined by $\varphi(1)$ by the additive property of such morphisms : $\varphi(n+m)=\varphi(n)+\varphi(m).$ Therefore, I only need to determine the possible values of $\varphi(1)$ . But I know that an automorphism must send generators on generators, and the generators of $\mathbb{Z}$ are $\pm1$ , so there are at most two automorphisms : $Id:x \mapsto x$ and $-Id:x \mapsto -x$ (and they are automorphisms, so these are the only ones). Therefore, a semi-direct product $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{\psi}\mathbb{Z}$ is given by a morphism $\psi:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow Aut({\mathbb{Z}}) \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . The only possibilites, if I didn't make any mistakes, are $\psi:n \rightarrow Id$ (constant morphism) and $\psi:n\rightarrow (-1)^nId$ ( $\psi$ is determined by $\psi(1)$ which is either $Id$ yielding the constant morphism or $-Id$ which yields the second one.) So there are only two semi-direct products possible, one of which is the direct product (I guess?). $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow id}\mathbb{Z}\cong\mathbb{Z}^2$ and $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow (-1)^nId} \mathbb{Z}$ Did I miss any of them, and is there anything to say about this last semi-direct product? Is $\mathbb{Z} \rtimes_{n \rightarrow (-1)^nId} \mathbb{Z}$ isomorphic to any known groups?
