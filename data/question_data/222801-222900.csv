I am trying to calculate the fibres of this morphism over closed points, and show that these are proper but that $f|_U:U\rightarrow \A^1_\C$ is not proper. Via some tensor product calculations, and by knowing that $U$ is the distinguished open corresponding to $t-1$ , I can calculate the fibres to be: $$f|_U^{-1}(z)=\begin{cases} V(t^2-z)\cong \Spec \C\times \C&\text{if }z\neq 1,0\\ V(t^2)\cong \Spec \C[t]/\langle t^2\rangle&\text{if }z=0\\ V(t+1)\cong \Spec \C&\text{if }z=1 \end{cases}$$ which follow because $\C[t]\otimes_{\C[t]}\otimes \C\cong \C[t]/\langle t^2-z\rangle$ , so the fibre of $f$ over $z$ is just $V(t^2-z)$ , and so the fibre of $f|_U$ is just $U_{t-1}\cap V(t^2-z)$ .

With $z=1$ , we have that $V(t^2-1)$ is not completely contained in $U_{t-1}$ , so $V(t^2-1)=V'(t^2-1)$ , where $V'(t^2-1)$ is the vanishing locus of the ideal $\langle t^2-1\rangle\subset \C[t]_{t-1}$ . Since $t-1$ is invertible, this is the vanishing locus of $V(t+1)$ in $\Spec C[t]_{t-1}$ , and the so this is isomorphic to $\Spec \C$ . I guess these are also proper because if we write $g_z$ as $f|_U$ restricted to the fibre over $z$ then these are all closed embeddings, and closed embeddings are proper. What I am confused about is how to prove that $f|_U:U\rightarrow \A^1$ is not proper.

Indeed taking ... to be ""line bundles"" shows that it is not even a Zariski sheaf: The stalks of the presheaf are all trivial, but there can exist non-trivial sections. I think I know what this means, but I'm relying on two guesses (which I'm charitably calling ""intuition"" in my attempt below). If someone could please verify them, and provide any other insight you think might be valuable, I would really appreciate it! Write $\mathsf{Aff}$ for the opposite of the category of finitely presented rings. Let's call this functor $\mathcal{L} : \mathsf{Aff}^\text{op} \to \mathsf{Set}$ , so it's a presheaf on $\mathsf{Aff}$ . We want to show that it's not a sheaf for the (big) Zariski topology. We'll do that by showing that each stalk is trivial there are nontrivial sections After all, if each stalk is trivial, then by uniqueness of gluing for sheaves, we should only get trivial sections. So if (1) and (2) are both satisfied, we'll show that $\mathcal{L}$ isn't a sheaf. Let's start with (2), which is easier. A section of $\mathcal{L}$ is just $\mathcal{L}(\text{Spec} S)$ for your favorite (finitely presented) ring $S$ . Of course, there are plenty of rings admitting nontrivial line bundles (said another way, there are plenty of rings $S$ with nontrivial picard group) so that nontrivial sections of $\mathcal{L}$ are abundant. Next up is (1). According to this MO question, points of $\mathcal{E} = \mathsf{Sh}(\mathsf{Aff}, \text{Zar})$ are local rings $R$ . Indeed, the inverse image part of the point (read: geometric morphism) $\mathsf{Set} \to \mathcal{E}$ will be given by $R^* : \mathcal{E} \to \mathsf{Set}$ , the kan extension of $\text{Hom}(\text{Spec}(R),-) : \mathsf{Aff} \to \mathsf{Set}$ along the (yoneda) embedding $y : \mathsf{Aff} \to \mathcal{E}$ . The good news is that we only need to understand $R^*$ , since the stalk of $\mathcal{L}$ at $R$ is exactly $R^* \mathcal{L}$ . The bad news is that I'm inexperienced with making these calculations... Intuition says that $R$ is a colimit of its finitely presented subrings, each of which is an object of $\mathsf{Aff}$ . So each finitely presented subring is like an ""open set containing $R$ "", and we should be able to compute the stalk of $\mathcal{L}$ at $R$ as $\text{colim } \mathcal{L}(\text{Spec} R_i)$ , where the $R_i$ are the finitely presented subrings of $R$ ... Much weaker intuition says that this should be the same thing as invertible sheaves on $R$ . This gives the expected answer since we know the picard group for local rings is trivial (remember $R$ was local). So indeed, if the above is correct, each stalk is trivial, showing (1), and we're done.

29,Two Projective closures of $\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$ which are not isomorphic as varieties.,Two Projective closures of  which are not isomorphic as varieties.,\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\},"I am doing some sample problems for my upcoming Algebraic Geometry exam, and one of the questions is: Is it true that all projective closures of an affine variety $X$ are   isomorphic as varieties? The problem gives the hint to consider various projective closures of $X=\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$. Here a projective closure of an affine variety $X$ is a closed subvariety $Y\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ for some $n$, together with an isomorphism $X\to U$ where $U\subset Y$ is open and dense. Discussion I started by considering the natural projective closure of $X=\mathbb{A}^1\setminus\{0\}$: We consider the identification of $\mathbb{A}^1$ with $D(x_0)\subset \mathbb{P}^1$, i.e. the map  $$\phi:\mathbb{A}^1\to D(x_0), \enspace p\mapsto [1:p]\in \mathbb{P}^1$$ Since $X$ is an open dense subset of $\mathbb{A}^1$, $\phi(X)$ is open and dense in $\mathbb{P}^1.$ Therefore $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a projective closure of $X$. The aim now is to find another projective closure of $X$ which is not isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a variety. For this I decided to view $X$ as $Y:=\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{A}^2:xy=1\}=Z(xy-1)$.

For example then  $$\varphi(Y)=D(z)\cap V(xy-z^2)$$  and so $V(xy-z^2)$ is a projective closure for of $Y$ and thus $X$- here I have used $V(f)$ to denote the zero set of a homogeneous poly $f$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$.

Shafarevich gives this construction: Replacing the elements of $G$ by their pullbacks, $G$ becomes a group of automorphisms of the coordinate ring $k[X]$.  Then the ring of invariants, $k[X]^G$, is a finitely generated $k$-algebra (we know this from the theory of invariants), and it contains no nilpotents because it is a subring of $k[X]$. Therefore, it is the coordinate ring of some closed $Y\subset\mathbb{A}^n$. Define $X/G=Y$. The quotient map $f:X\rightarrow Y=X/G$ is characterized by having the inclusion $k[Y]=k[X]^G\hookrightarrow k[X]$ as a pullback. Shafarevich convinced me that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ with  $x_1,x_2\in X$ if and only if $\exists g\in G$ such that $gx_1=x_2$. This shows that $\operatorname{im}f$ parametrizes the orbits of $X$ under the $G$-action. The question I still have, though, is why it should be that $\operatorname{im}f$ exhausts $Y$. Since $k[X]^G\hookrightarrow k[X]$ is an injection, it is clear why $\operatorname{im}f$ needs to be dense in $Y$; but in order for this notion of quotient to coincide with my more familiar topological notion, I would like to be sure that it actually exhausts it. So, How can we be sure that $\operatorname{im}f=Y$? Here is an equivalent form of the same question, which I am finding it easier to think about. The points of $X,Y$ can be identified with maximal ideals of $k[X],k[Y]$. If I am thinking about this correctly, then for any regular map $g:X\rightarrow Y$, $g(x_0)=y_0$ if and only if $\mathfrak{x_0}$ contains $g^*(\mathfrak{y_0})$, where $\mathfrak{x_0},\mathfrak{y_0}$ are the maximal ideals of $k[X],k[Y]$ corresponding to $x_0\in X,y_0\in Y$. Thus $y_0\in \operatorname{im}g$ if and only if $g^*(\mathfrak{y_0})$ is contained in some maximal ideal of $k[X]$, i.e. it does not generate the unit ideal in $k[X]$. So the above question can be restated: How can we be sure that $k[X]^G$ does not have any maximal ideals that generate the unit ideal of $k[X]$? Is it because if a unit of $k[X]$ is $G$-invariant, then its inverse is also $G$-invariant? Note: I am fairly new to algebraic geometry, so please do not answer in the language of schemes if possible. I am conversant with commutative algebra at the level of Atiyah-Macdonald. EDIT : As often happens to me on this website, as I wrote out my question I got some new ideas. I now think I can prove what I want if the characteristic of the ground field $k$ does not divide the group order $|G|$. But I hope the surjectivity of $f:X\rightarrow X/G$ doesn't depend on this, so I still very much want to hear your answers. My argument is this: Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be any ideal of $k[X]^G$. Suppose that $\mathfrak{a}$ generates the unit ideal in $k[X]$. Then there is some equation $$1=u_1a_1+\dots+u_ma_m$$ where $a_1,\dots,a_m\in \mathfrak{a}\subset k[X]^G$ and $u_1,\dots,u_m\in k[X]$. If $\operatorname{char} k \nmid |G|$, then $|G|$ is a nonzero element of $k$, so we can average the above equation across $G$, to obtain $$1=u_1'a_1+\dots+u_m'a_m$$ where $u_j'=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} gu_j$, since $1$ and all the $a_j$'s are fixed under action of $G$. But then $u_1',\dots,u_m'\in k[X]^G$, so that actually $\mathfrak{a}$ must already have been the unit ideal of $k[X]^G$. How can the reliance on the condition $\operatorname{char}k\nmid |G|$ be removed? Is a totally different argument needed?","I have just read the construction of the quotient of a closed subset $X$ of affine space by a finite group $G$ of automorphisms of $X$, in Shafarevich, Basic Algebraic Geometry I .

Note: I am fairly new to algebraic geometry, so please do not answer in the language of schemes if possible. I am conversant with commutative algebra at the level of Atiyah-Macdonald. EDIT : As often happens to me on this website, as I wrote out my question I got some new ideas. I now think I can prove what I want if the characteristic of the ground field $k$ does not divide the group order $|G|$. But I hope the surjectivity of $f:X\rightarrow X/G$ doesn't depend on this, so I still very much want to hear your answers. My argument is this: Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be any ideal of $k[X]^G$. Suppose that $\mathfrak{a}$ generates the unit ideal in $k[X]$. Then there is some equation $$1=u_1a_1+\dots+u_ma_m$$ where $a_1,\dots,a_m\in \mathfrak{a}\subset k[X]^G$ and $u_1,\dots,u_m\in k[X]$. If $\operatorname{char} k \nmid |G|$, then $|G|$ is a nonzero element of $k$, so we can average the above equation across $G$, to obtain $$1=u_1'a_1+\dots+u_m'a_m$$ where $u_j'=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} gu_j$, since $1$ and all the $a_j$'s are fixed under action of $G$. But then $u_1',\dots,u_m'\in k[X]^G$, so that actually $\mathfrak{a}$ must already have been the unit ideal of $k[X]^G$. How can the reliance on the condition $\operatorname{char}k\nmid |G|$ be removed? Is a totally different argument needed?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'invariant-theory']"

By localizing at $\mathfrak{m}$, we may assume that $B \otimes_A C$ is local, and the composition $$A \to B \to B \otimes_A C$$ is faithfully flat (flat + local homomorphism implies faithfully flat).

Now tensor with $B$ to get $$ K \otimes_A (C \otimes_A B) = 0$$ and conclude that $K= 0$ by faithful flatness. My question is: A necessary condition for (**) to be true is that the product $B \otimes_A C$ is not zero. How can I get this just from the fact that there is a map $C \to A$?

If we let $\mathcal{F}$ be the sheaf, then it's clear that $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset)$ is the trivial group and that we have a commutative diagram of restrictions from $\mathcal{F}(\{0\})$ to $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset)$ , from $\mathcal{F}(\{1\})$ to $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset)$ , from $\mathcal{F}(\{0,1\})$ to $\mathcal{F}(\{0\})$ , and from $\mathcal{F}(\{0,1\})$ to $\mathcal{F}(\emptyset)$ . By the sheaf axiom, it seems like for any $s\in\mathcal{F}(\{0\})$ and $t\in\mathcal{F}({\{1\}})$ , $s$ and $t$ restricted to the intersection, $\emptyset$ , must be the same, so there is some unique section in $\mathcal{F}(\{0,1\})$ that restricts to $s$ and $t$ . What does this say about $\mathcal{F}(\{0,1\})$ ? I'm guessing it's related to the fiber product, but I'm not particularly well-versed in category theory. Also, how does this generalize to sheaves over different categories?","I'm working through the Geometry of Schemes and wanted some clarification for an exercise.

It is exercise 2.3 in Algebraic Geometry I: Schemes, with examples and exercises Ulrich Görtz and Torsten Wedhorn. In what follows below $A$ is a commutative ring with unit. The problem statement reads: Show that the nilradical of $A$ is equal to the Jacobson radical of $A$ if and only if every open subset of $\text{Spec}A$ contains a closed point of $\text{Spec} A.$ My attempted proof of the forward direction: Proof. We first parse the definitions in the problem statement. We recall that the nilradical of $A,$ denoted $\mathfrak N,$ is the ideal containing all nilpotent elements of $A,$ or equivalently the intersection of all the prime ideals of $A. $ The Jacobson radical of $A,$ denoted $\mathfrak R$ is defined as the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A.$ By definition 2.2. in GW, open sets of $\text{Spec} A$ are of the form  $$\text{Spec} A \smallsetminus V(\mathfrak a) := \left\{\mathfrak p \in \text{Spec} A; \mathfrak a \not\subset \mathfrak p\right\}$$ for some ideal $\mathfrak a$ of $A.$ Finally we recall that by example 2.9 in GW, a closed point $\mathfrak m$ of $\text{Spec} A$ is precisely a maximal ideal of $A.$ With these definitions in mind, we need to show that $\mathfrak N = \mathfrak R$ if and only if for every ideal $\mathfrak a$ of $A$ there is a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ of $A$ so that $\mathfrak a \not\subset \mathfrak m.$ For the forward direction, we proceed by contrapositive. Let $\mathfrak a \subset A$ be an ideal and suppose it is contained in every maximal ideal of $A.$ In particular this implies that $\mathfrak a \neq (1).$ But then $V(\mathfrak a) \neq \emptyset$ which in turn implies that $\text{Spec} A \smallsetminus V(\mathfrak a) \neq \text{Spec} A.$ This can only be true if there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $A$ that does not contain $\mathfrak a.$ In other words, $\mathfrak a \subseteq \mathfrak R$ but $\mathfrak a \not\subset \mathfrak N,$ i.e., $\mathfrak R \neq \mathfrak N.\\$ I believe that one of the conditions in the problem statement cannot be met. Indeed, for any commutative ring $A,$ the open set $U:=\text{Spec}A \smallsetminus V(\mathfrak R),$ where $\mathfrak R$ is the Jacobson radical of $A,$ by definition could never include a closed point. Is there a typo in the problem statement? It seems like the problem would make sense if all open sets except $U$ were considered. On the other hand, I am quite new to Algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, so there is a good chance I have bungled the meaning of the problem statement. I would also appreciate any hints for the reverse direction of the proof (please do not write out a whole proof, I am just looking for hints).
