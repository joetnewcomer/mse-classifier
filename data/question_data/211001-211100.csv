4,How to use pigeonhole principle to demonstrate lower bound in this problem is $\frac{k(n+1)}{2}$?,How to use pigeonhole principle to demonstrate lower bound in this problem is ?,\frac{k(n+1)}{2},"Background This is not a homework problem, but I am reading through a discrete mathematics book since I am trying to formalize my background in computer science. I came across the following. Problem Suppose the integers from $1$ to $n$ are arranged in some order around a circle, and let $k$ be an integer with $1 ≤ k ≤ n$. Show that there must exist a sequence of k adjacent numbers in the arrangement whose sum is at least $$ \frac{k(n+1)}{2} $$ Pseudo proof Based on the formula of an arithmetic series, let us consider any k such that, at least initially our choice for $k < n$. Thus, we can enumerate through the first $k - 1$ objects and select $n$ to make sure we have $k$ adjacent numbers. In other words, this particular choices gives us $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = n$ so that we have $$ S_n = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2} = \frac{k(n+1)}{2}$$. I contend that we know this is at least the above since I chose all $ k - 1 $ consecutive numbers below $ k $ and the maximum in the set $ n$. I can choose whatever I want, so it stands to reason that larger numbers will be larger than the sum above and thus represents a lower bound. This concludes my pseudo proof. Issue Just one. How could I prove this with the pigeonhole principle? I have some beef with my above logic. First, the chapter in my book is about the pigeonhole principle. Which is easy to understand, but I am not quite sure how to apply that property to solve the above problem. The second is the proof is a little handwavy by appealing to intuition. I think this would suffice on a napkin during cocktails, ahem , but not stand up to rigorous standards.","Background This is not a homework problem, but I am reading through a discrete mathematics book since I am trying to formalize my background in computer science.

Prove that $M_k(G)$ is a matroid for all $k \geq 0$. My partial solution: $M_0(G) = (E, S), F \in S$ if and only if $F$ forest. $\{\emptyset\}$ is in $S$. No cycles, therefore a forest. Downward closed : $S$ is downward closed, as every subgraph of a forest is also a forest and therefore also independent (i.e in $S$). The exchange property : Let $F_1, F_2 \in S$ be forests where $|F_1| = |F_2| + 1$. The number of vertices is given by $|V| = |F_1| + k_1 = |F_2| + k_2$, where $k_i$ is the number of trees in the forest. Therefore, $k_1 = k_2 - 1$, which means that there must exist an edge $F_1 \setminus F_2$ which connects two trees in $F_1$. Does axiom still hold for $k > 0$?

Let $B$ be the set of all size $m$ subsets of $A$.  $B=\left\{{B_1,B_2, \ldots , B_{\binom{n}{m}} } \right\}$, $  |B_i|=m$ then we want to find $k$ subsets of $A$, each of size $r$, (let call them  $C=\left\{{C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k}\right\}$, $|C_i|=r$ ), so that for any $B_i$, there exists at least one $C_j$ in $C$ so that the intersection of $B_i$ and $C_j$ is empty. Example,  if $n=7$, $m=3$, $r=2$,  then with $k=7$ subsets we can build $C$ as follows: $C=\left\{ {\left\{ {1, 2}\right\}, \left\{ {2, 3}\right\}, \left\{ {3, 4}\right\}, \left\{ {4, 5}\right\}, \left\{ {5, 6}\right\}, \left\{ {6, 7}\right\}, \left\{ {7, 1}\right\}}\right\}$ which has the property that for any subset of $A$ of size $m=3$, denoted by $B_i=\left\{{b1,b2,b3}\right\}$,  there is at least one $C_j$ in $C$, that has no intersection with $B_i$.

If there are any internal vertices in $T$ at levels less than $h — 1$ that do not have two children, take a leaf at level $h$ and move it to be such a missing child. This only lowers the average depth of a leaf in this tree, and since we are trying to prove a lower bound on the average depth, it suffices to prove the bound for the resulting tree. Repeat this process until there are no more internal vertices of this type. As a result, all the leaves are now at levels $h — 1$ and $h$. Now delete all vertices at level $h$. This changes the number of vertices by at most (one more than) a factor of two and so has no effect on a big-Omega estimate (it changes $\log n$ by at most 1). Now the tree is complete, and it has $2^{h-1}$ leaves, all at depth $h — 1$, where now $n = 2^{h-1}$. The desired estimate follows.
