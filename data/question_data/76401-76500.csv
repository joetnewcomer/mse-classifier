1,A Technicality for an Arbitrary Cartesian Product Intersection Identity,A Technicality for an Arbitrary Cartesian Product Intersection Identity,,"I'm going through Munkre's Topology book. To set the stage, we want to be able to define a cartesian product for arbitrary index sets. He employs the following definition: Let $\{A_{\alpha} \}_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of sets; let $X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}A_{\alpha}$ . The cartesian product of this indexed family, denoted by $\prod_{\alpha \in J}A_{\alpha}$ is defined to be the set of all J-tuples of elements of $X$ . That is, the set of all functions \begin{equation} x: J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}A_{\alpha} \end{equation} such that $x(\alpha) \in A_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha \in J$ . Alright, this is all well and good. My goal is to show the following identity: Let $\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ and $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in J}$ be two indexed family of sets. Then, \begin{equation}      \prod_{\alpha \in J}(U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha}) = \prod_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha} \cap \prod_{\alpha \in J} V_{\alpha} \end{equation} Going in one of these directions isn't difficult to do but I've been having trouble with the reverse direction due to a subtlety. I am having difficulty showing that $f \in \prod_{\alpha \in J}(U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha})$ implies $f \in \prod_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha} \cap \prod_{\alpha \in J} V_{\alpha}$ . I'll now walk through my attempt until the point where I got stuck: Suppose that $f \in \prod_{\alpha \in J}(U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha})$ , then $f: J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}(U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha})$ such that $f(\alpha) \in U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha}$ for each $\alpha \in J$ . Therefore, $f(\alpha) \in U_{\alpha}$ and $f(\alpha) \in V_{\alpha}$ . Trivial so far, no issues. Our goal is to simultaneously show that we can write $f: J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha}$ and $f: J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}V_{\alpha}$ . Here is where it gets nuanced for me. For us to be able to do this requires that $\bigcup_{\alpha \in J}V_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}(U_{\alpha} \cap V_{\alpha})$ . Part of what defines a function is its codomain, so these sets must be equivalent for us to proceed with the result, but it seems like there is no reason why these sets should be equal. I will say that it's trivial to construct functions \begin{equation}      f': J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha}, \qquad f'': J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}V_{\alpha} \end{equation} such that $f'(\alpha) = f(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha \in J$ and $f''(\alpha) = f(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha \in J$ . However, $f \neq f' \neq f''$ because the codomains are all different. I was wondering whether I'm missing something or if the notion of a cartesian product requires an amendment, namely something like ""...that it is the set of all surjective functions $x: J \to A$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}A_{\alpha}$ and $x_{\alpha} \in A_{\alpha}$ for all $\alpha \in J$ "".","I'm going through Munkre's Topology book.

19,The set is meager if it has a cover of clopen meager sets,The set is meager if it has a cover of clopen meager sets,,"Let $X$ be a topological space such that there exists a collection of meager clopen sets $(C_i)_{i \in I}$ such that $X = \bigcup_{i \in I} C_i$ . I want to prove that $X$ is then meager itself. As each $C_i$ is meager there is a sequence of nowhere dense sets $(N_{i,n})^\infty_{n=1}$ such that $C_i = \bigcup^\infty_{n=1} N_{i,n}$ . For natural $n$ define set $M_n = \bigcup_{i\in I} N_{i,n}$ . Then by basic set theory $$ X = \bigcup_{i \in I} C_i = \bigcup_{i \in I} \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty N_{i,n} =   \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i \in I} N_{i,n} = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty  M_n. $$ So, we need to show that each $M_n$ is meager and we are done. Initaly I thought that it may be possible to use clopennes to write something like $$ \mathrm{int}\;\mathrm{cl}\;M_n = \mathrm{int}\;\mathrm{cl}\;\bigcup_{i \in I} N_{i,n} = \bigcup_{i \in I} \mathrm{int}\;\mathrm{cl}\; N_{i,n} = \bigcup_{i \in I} \emptyset =\emptyset, $$ where $\mathrm{int}$ and $\mathrm{cl}$ stand for interior and closure operations respectively, so $M_n$ is nowhere dense. But this works only if $(C_i)_{i \in I}$ are disjoint. This won't work in general, for example take $(C_i)_{i \in I}$ to be a collection of all clopen sets in $X=\mathbb{Q}$ , and choose $N_{i,n}$ to be a collection of singletons so each $M_n = \mathbb{Q}$ . I know that in this example sets $X$ is meager, but I wanted to show that argument above may fail in general. My first idea was to transform $(C_i)_{i\in I}$ into a different disjoint clopen cover $(C'_j)_{j \in J}$ , such that for each $j\in J$ there is $i\in I$ with $C'_j\subset C_i$ . But how to do so? In case $X$ is locally connected one can just take its connected components, but this won't work in general. I thought that a transfinite induction may also work.

In section II.1.4 he proves that the algebraic closure, $\mathbb{Q}_p^a$ , of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is not complete by showing it's not a Baire space. The proof goes as follows: Let us define the sequence of subsets $$X_n= \{x\in\mathbb{Q}_p^a\mid [\mathbb{Q}_p(x):\mathbb{Q}_p]=n\},\quad n\geq 1\quad(1)$$ so that $\mathbb{Q}_p^a=\bigcup X_n$ . It is also obvious that $\lambda X_n\subset X_n$ ( $\lambda\in\mathbb{Q}_p$ ), $X_m+X_n\subset X_{mn}$ , and in particular $$X_n+X_n\subset X_{n^2}.\quad (2)$$ $\quad$ (a) These subsets are closed. If $x\neq 0$ is in the closure of $X_n$ , say $x=\lim x_i$ with a sequence $(x_i)$ in $X_n$ , then for each $x_i$ , let $f_i(X)\in\mathbb{Q}_p[X]$ be a polynomial of least degree with $x_i$ as a root and coefficients scaled so they lie in $\mathbb{Z}$ and at least one of them is in $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ . Extracting if necessary a subsequence of $(f_i)$ , we can assume that it converges (in norm, coefficient-wise), say $f_i\to f$ , so $f\in\mathbb{Z}_p[X]$ has degree less than or equal to $n$ and at least one coefficient in $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ , so $f(X)\neq 0$ . By the ultrametric property, the convergence $f_i\to f$ is uniform on all bounded sets of $\mathbb{Q}_p^a$ . Since the convergent sequence $(x_i)$ is bounded, we have $$f(x)-f_i(x_i)=\underbrace{f(x)-f(x_i)}_{\to 0}+\underbrace{f(x_i)-f_i(x_i)}_{\to 0}\to 0.$$ This implies $f(x)=\lim f_i(x_i)=0$ and $x\in X_n.\,\,(3)$ $\quad$ (b) The subset $X_n$ have no interior point. Since for any closed ball $B$ of positive radius in $\mathbb{Q}_p^a$ we have $\mathbb{Q}_p^a=\mathbb{Q}_p\cdot B$ $(4)$ , such ball cannot be contained in a subset $X_n$ , and no translates can be contained in $X_n$ . It seems like the definition in $(1)$ should be $X_n =\{x\in\mathbb{Q}_p^a\mid [\mathbb{Q}_p(x):\mathbb{Q}_p]\leq n\}$ so the equality in $(2)$ holds. Otherwise for $x\in X_n$ , $2x\in X_n+X_n$ but is not in $X_{n^2}$ since the degree of $x$ and $2x$ will be the same. Moreover, in $(3)$ Robert claims $x\in X_n$ since $f(x)=0$ and $\deg f\leq n$ , which only works if $X_n$ is the set of all elements of degree at most $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ . The problem with defining $X_n$ in this way is that it no longer has an empty interior since $\mathbb{Q}_p\subset X_n$ . So I am not sure what am I missing here.

( $\Rightarrow$ ). If $f$ is continuous, then for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$ we have that for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x\in X$ with $\left|x-a\right|<\delta$ this is going to imply that $\left|f(x)-f(a)\right|<\varepsilon$ . Take an open set $A\subset f[\mathbb{R}]\subset \mathbb{R}$ ( I'm not sure if it's necessary to take it as subset of $f[\mathbb{R}]$ ). For any $f(a)\in A$ , because $f$ is continuous, we can choose any $\varepsilon>0$ , so we do it by choosing $\varepsilon_{f(a)}>0$ such that $(f(a)-\varepsilon,f(a)+\varepsilon)\subset A$ , and this is possible because $A$ is open by hypothesis. As $f$ is continuous, this $\varepsilon_{f(a)}>0$ will gives us a $\delta_{a}>0$ such that all $x\in \mathbb{R}$ that are within a distance $\delta_a$ from $a$ will have their image $f(x)$ within a distance $\varepsilon_{f(a)}$ from $f(a)$ . That is, we are going to have an open interval $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)$ , and because all of the $x\in\mathbb{R}$ inside of this interval have their image $f(x)\in A$ , this interval $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)$ is a subset of $f^{-1}(A)$ . If we follow this for all $f(a)\in A$ , we are going to end up with an open interval with center $a$ and radius $\delta_a$ for each $a\in f^{-1}(A)$ , so $f^{-1}(A)$ is open. ( $\Leftarrow$ ). We have that for every open set $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ we have $f^{-1}(A)$ open in $\mathbb{R}$ .

So we can obtain an $a\in f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]$ . And because $f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]\subset f^{-1}(A)$ and $f^{-1}(A)$ is open, we choose a $\delta_a>0$ such that $(a-\delta_a,a+\delta_a)\subset f^{-1}[(f(a)-\varepsilon_{f(a)},f(a)+\varepsilon_{f(a)})]$ .

50,"Continuous functions from $\Bbb{N}$ to $\Bbb{N}$ in the ""co-small"" topology","Continuous functions from  to  in the ""co-small"" topology",\Bbb{N} \Bbb{N},"In a related post, I asked about the ""co-small"" topology on $\Bbb{N}$ . One of the questions was about characterizing the continuous functions from $\Bbb{N}$ to itself in this topology. Some examples of continuous functions include $f(n) = an + b$ , $f(n) = \lfloor n^p \rfloor$ for $0 < p \leq 1$ , the prime counting function $f(n) = \pi(n)$ ; some functions that are not continuous would be $f(n) = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1$ , $f(n) = p_n$ (the $n$ th prime), $f(n) = \lfloor e^{\sqrt{\ln n}} \rfloor$ . Other users have given partial results. Ben shows that if $f: \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}$ is continuous and $f(A)$ is small for any large set $A$ , then $f$ is constant. Greg Martin shows that if $f: \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}$ satisfies $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(n)/n = \infty$ on any large set $A$ , then $f$ must map some large subset of $A$ to a small set, and therefore cannot be continuous in this topology. I think I'm prepared to give a characterization of how quickly or slowly a non-constant continuous function $f: \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}$ can grow: (Proposed) Theorem. A function $f$ from $\Bbb{N}$ to itself is continuous in the co-small topology iff only if there exist positive constants $M, p$ such that: $f(n) \leq Mn$ for all but a small set of positive integers $n$ ; $f(n) \geq n^p$ for all but a small set of positive integers $n$ . Greg Martin's answer dispatches of (1), and Ben's answer implies that $f(n) \to \infty$ except possibly on a small set of positive integers $n$ (finite sets are small, so the preimage of any finite set under a continuous function cannot be large). My answer for the last part is based on thinking about, e.g. $f(n) = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$ vs. $f(n) = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1$ . For $f(n) = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$ , for any integer $k$ , $$\sum_{n \in f^{-1}(k)} \frac{1}{n} \approx \frac{2}{k},$$ and so the preimage of any large set is also large.

Some examples of continuous functions include , for , the prime counting function ; some functions that are not continuous would be , (the th prime), . Other users have given partial results. Ben shows that if is continuous and is small for any large set , then is constant. Greg Martin shows that if satisfies on any large set , then must map some large subset of to a small set, and therefore cannot be continuous in this topology. I think I'm prepared to give a characterization of how quickly or slowly a non-constant continuous function can grow: (Proposed) Theorem. A function from to itself is continuous in the co-small topology iff only if there exist positive constants such that: for all but a small set of positive integers ; for all but a small set of positive integers . Greg Martin's answer dispatches of (1), and Ben's answer implies that except possibly on a small set of positive integers (finite sets are small, so the preimage of any finite set under a continuous function cannot be large).

52,Continuity of retraction on $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$,Continuity of retraction on,r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B,"I'm reading Milnor's Morse Theory and I have difficulty verifying some claim (which is easy according to Milnor) on page $88$ ,  section $\S 16$ in the book. Here's the setup for my question. In the end, I only ask about how to show that a certain map between metric spaces is continuous. Let $\Omega= \Omega(M;p,q)$ be the set of piecewise smooth path $\omega : [0,1]\to M$ from $p$ to $q$ in the connected, complete Riemannian manifold $M$ . This set equipped with metric function $d : \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $$ d(\omega,\omega') = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega(t), \omega'(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\omega}(t)\| - \|\dot{\omega}'(t)\| \Big)^2 dt }, $$ where $\rho : M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$ is the topological metric of $M$ coming from its Riemannian metric. I already showed that the Energy function $E : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ , $E(\omega) = \int_0^1 \|\dot{\omega}\|^2 dt $ is continuous. So for some $c>0$ we have open subset $\text{Int }\Omega^c :=  E^{-1}([0,c))$ . For a subdivision $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_k=1$ ,  let $\Omega(t_0,\dots,t_k)$ be a subspace of $\Omega$ consisting of paths $\omega : [0,1] \to M$ such that segment $\omega|[t_{i-1},t_i]$ is a geodesic for each $i=1,\dots,k$ . Finally we have subspace $$ B := \text{Int }\Omega^c \, \cap \, \Omega(t_0,\dots,t_k).  $$ It is shown in the text that we can define a map $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$ such that each piecewise-smooth curve $\omega \in \text{Int }\Omega^c = E^{-1}([0,c))$ maped to unique broken geodesic $r(\omega) \in B$ formed by joining the end points $\omega(t_{i-1})$ to $\omega(t_i)$ by minimal geodesic. The detail as follows : for each $i=1,\dots,k$ , the couple $\omega(t_{i-1}),\omega(t_i)$ contained in a neighbourhood $W_i$ of a point $x_i \in M$ such that $W_i \times W_i \subset F(U' \times B_{\delta}(0))$ , where $F : U' \times B_{\delta}(0) \to M \times M$ is the map $F(x,v)=(x,\text{exp}_x(v))$ which map $U'\times B_{\delta}(0)$ diffeomorphic onto its image. Therefore the couple $\omega(t_{i-1}),\omega(t_i)$ contained in the image $F(U'\times B_{\delta}(0))$ which means that there is a unique minimal geodesic from $\omega(t_{i-1})$ to $\omega(t_i)$ . Therefore broken geodesic $r(\omega)$ uniquely determined. $\color{blue}{(\star)}$ Question : How to show that the map $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$ is continuous? I decided to show this by sequence criteria for continuous function. That is if $\omega_n \to \omega$ as $n \to \infty$ then $\gamma_n=r(\omega_n) \to \gamma=r(\omega)$ as $n \to \infty$ . Here is my thought so far: The sequence $\omega_n \to \omega$ says that I can make the distance $$ d(\omega_n,\omega) = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega_n(t), \omega(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\omega}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\omega}(t)\| \Big)^2 dt }, \qquad (1) $$ as small  as i like by letting $n$ large enough. Let $\epsilon>0$ be the challenge, i have to show that for $n$ large enough, the distance $$ d(\gamma_n,\gamma) = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \gamma_n(t), \gamma(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| \Big)^2 dt }, \qquad (2) $$ will be small than $\epsilon$ . I think I can show that $ \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \gamma_n(t), \gamma(t)\big) $ can be made small as I like since I can control the term $\max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega_n(t), \omega(t)\big)$ . My problem is to control the integral term in $(2)$ . I know that the $\gamma$ 's are broken geodesics, so on each segement $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ , the integrand $\Big( \|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| \Big)^2$ on the integral term in $(2)$ , is constant. So if i can show that on each segment that $\|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| \to \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| $ as $n \to \infty$ for some fix $t \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$ , then the whole integral goes to zero. To show this, i plan to use the continuity of exponential map $(q,v) \to \text{exp}(p,v)$ that define each geodesic segment $\gamma_n$ and $\gamma$ . Am I on the right track ? Any help will be appreciated. Thank you. Update Here is the detail of my idea in the paragraph above this: lets concentrate on a particular segment $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ . Since i already showed that $\max_{t \in [0,1]} \rho\big( \gamma_n(t),\gamma(t) \big) \to 0$ we have $$ \rho\big( \gamma_n(t_{i-1}),\gamma(t_{i-1}) \big) \to 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \rho\big( \gamma_n(t_{i}),\gamma(t_{i}) \big) \to 0. $$ Therefore if $W_i$ is the neighbourhood of a point $x_i \in M$ such that $\omega(t_{i-1}) = \gamma(t_{i-1})$ and $\omega(t_i) = \gamma(t_i)$ both contained in $W_i$ (as described in $\color{blue}{(\star)}$ above), then for $n$ large enough the end points $\gamma_n(t_{i-1})$ and $\gamma_n(t_i)$ also contained in $W_i$ . Since $W_i \times W_i \subset F(U'\times B_{\delta}(0))$ with $F(x,v):=(x,\text{exp}_x(v))$ and $F$ diffeomorphic to its image, then $$ F(\gamma_n(t_{i-1}),v_n) = (\gamma_n(t_{i-1}), \gamma_n(t_i)), \quad \text{and} \quad F(\gamma(t_{i-1}),v) = (\gamma(t_{i-1}), \gamma(t_i)) $$ for some tangent vectors $v_n$ and $v $ at the starting points. But since the curves $\text{exp}_{\gamma(t_{i-1})}(tv_n)$ with domain $[0,1]$ is just reparametrization of geodesic segment $\gamma_n|[t_{i-1},t_i]$ , then the initial velocities related by a constant as $v_n = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}_n\|$ . Similarly for $\gamma$ we have $ v = \lambda \| \dot{\gamma} \|$ . Since $F$ diffeomorphism (onto its image) we can write $$ (\gamma_n(t_{i-1}),v_n) = F^{-1}(\gamma_n(t_{i-1}), \gamma_n(t_i)), \quad \text{and} \quad (\gamma(t_{i-1}),v) = F^{-1}(\gamma(t_{i-1}), \gamma(t_i)). $$ Now by continuity of $F^{-1}$ , the convergence $\gamma_n(t_{i-1}) \to \gamma(t_{i-1})$ and $\gamma_n(t_i) \to \gamma(t_i)$ implies $v_n = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}_n\| \to v = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}\| $ .

My Attempt: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f \colon X \rightarrow Y$ be a continuous map. Case 1. Suppose that $X$ is Lindelof. Let $\mathscr{A}$ be an open covering of $f(X)$ regarded as a subspace of $Y$ . For each $V \in \mathscr{A}$ , we can find an open set $V^\prime$ of $Y$ such that $$ V = f(X) \cap V^\prime. \tag{0} $$ Let $\mathscr{A}^\prime$ be the open covering of $Y$ given by $$ \mathscr{A}^\prime \colon= \left\{ \, V^\prime \, \colon \, V^\prime \mbox{ is open in $Y$ and } f(X) \cap V^\prime \in \mathscr{A} \, \right\}. \tag{Definition 0} $$ [Please refer to (0) above.] Let $V \in \mathscr{A}$ and $V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime$ for which (0) above holds.

We note that \begin{align}  f(X) &= \bigcup_{V \in \mathscr{A}} V \\  &= \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} \left( f(X)\cap V^\prime \right) \\  &= f(X) \cap \left( \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} V^\prime \right) \\  &\subset \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} V^\prime, \end{align} which implies that $$ f(X) \subset \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} V^\prime. $$ Now since $$ \bigcup_{V \in \mathscr{A}} V = f(X) \subset \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} V^\prime, $$ therefore we obtain \begin{align}  f^{-1} \left( \bigcup_{V \in \mathscr{A}} V  \right) &= f^{-1}\big( f(X) \big) \\  &\subset f^{-1} \left( \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime} V^\prime \right) \\  &\subset X,  \end{align} [Of course all the inverse images are subsets of the domain.] which simplifies to $$ \bigcup_{V \in \mathscr{A}} f^{-1} \left( V  \right) = X = \bigcup_{V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime}  f^{-1} \left( V^\prime \right). \tag{2}  $$ Thus the collection $$  \mathscr{A}_X \colon= \left\{ \, f^{-1} (V) \, \colon \, V \in \mathscr{A} \, \right\} = \left\{ \, f^{-1} \left(V^\prime \right) \, \colon \, V^\prime \in \mathscr{A}^\prime \, \right\} $$ is an open covering of the Lindelof space $X$ , and therefore some countable subcollection of $\mathscr{A}_X$ also covers $X$ ; let one such countable subcollection be $$ \left\{\, f^{-1} \left( V_n \right) \, \colon \, n \in \mathbb{N} \, \right\} = \left\{\, f^{-1} \left( V_n^\prime \right) \, \colon \, n \in \mathbb{N} \, \right\}. $$ [Please refer to (1) above.] Finally since $$  X = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N} } f^{-1} \left( V_n \right), $$ therefore we obtain \begin{align}  f(X) &= f \left( \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N} } f^{-1} \left( V_n \right) \right) \\  &= \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N} } f \left(  f^{-1} \left( V_n \right) \right) \\  &\subset \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} V_n \\  &\subset f(X), \end{align} [The last inclusion follwos from the fact that the sets $V_n$ are in the covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $f(X)$ .] and hence $$ \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N} } V_n = f(X).  $$ Thus the collection $$ \left\{ \, V_n \, \colon \, n \in \mathbb{N} \, \right\} $$ is a countable subcollection of $\mathscr{A}$ that also covers $f(X)$ . This shows that every open covering $\mathscr{A}$ of $f(X)$ has a countable subcollection also covering $f(X)$ .

Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of $X$ . Then $D \subset X$ such that $\overline{D} = X$ , and since $f \colon X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous, therefore by Theorem 18.1 (2) in Munkres we obtain $$ f(X) = f\left( \overline{D} \right) \subset \overline{ f(D) }, $$ and hence by Theorem 17.4 in Munkres $$ \left(\overline{f(D)}\right)_{\mbox{in } f(X)} = f(X) \cap \overline{f(D)} = f(X), $$ that is, $$ \left(\overline{f(D)}\right)_{\mbox{in } f(X)} = f(X). \tag{3}  $$ Here $\overline{f(D)}$ denotes the closure of $f(D)$ in the topological space $Y$ . Moreover, as $D$ is a countable subset of $X$ and as $f \colon X \rightarrow Y$ is a single-valued map, so we can conclude that $f(D)$ is also a countable subset of $f(X)$ . From (3) above and what has been stated in the preceding paragraphs, we can conclude that $f(X)$ has a countable dense subset $f(D)$ whenever $X$ has a countable dense subset $D$ .

Now, since $I$ is locally compact Hausdorff, by the exponential law the endofunctor $$- \times I : \mathsf{Top} \to \mathsf{Top}$$ is left adjoint to $\mathsf{Top}(I,-)  :\mathsf{Top} \to \mathsf{Top}$ . Hence the former preserves colimits and so $M_f \times I$ is the pushout of $X \times I \xrightarrow{i_0 \times 1} (X \times I) \times I$ and $X \times I \xrightarrow{f \times 1} Y \times I$ . Thus, the map $J$ corresponds to a certain selection of maps $\tilde{H} : (X \times I) \times I \to W$ and $\tilde{g} : Y \times I \to W$ so that $$\tilde{g}(f(x),t) = \tilde{H}(x,0,t).$$ My intuition here is to leave the 'initial data' $g$ fixed on $Y$ , and at each instant $s$ to have a function from $X \times I$ that behaves like $H_0$ in the bottom face and coinides with $H_s$ at the top face. This would make $J$ an extension of the original homotopy. Hence I wanted to define $$ \tilde{H}(x,s,t) = H(x,ts) \text{ and } \tilde{g}(y,t) =g_Y(y). $$ However, for these to induce a map from $M_f$ we should have that $g([(x,0)]) = g([(x,1)])$ for all $x \in X$ . But moreover, for the induced map to preserve the initial data, one should have $g = Ji_0$ and $H = J(i \times 1_I)$ which amounts to proving $$ g([(x,t)]) = g([(x,0)]) \quad (\forall t \in I). $$ It is not evident to me that this is the case. What's missing here? Are my choices for $\tilde{H}$ and $\tilde{g}$ incorrect? Any help is much appreciated.","I'm trying to prove that given a continuous map , the inclusion is a cofibration.

Now, this is the exercise: \begin{array} { l } { \text { Let } \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } \text { be the subset of } \mathbb { R } ^ { \omega } \text { consisting of all sequences that are ""eventually zero,"" } } \\ { \text { that is, all sequences } \left( x _ { 1 } , x _ { 2 } , \ldots \right) \text { such that } x _ { i } \neq 0 \text { for only finitely many values } } \\ { \text { of } i . \text { What is the closure of } \mathbb { R } ^ { \infty } \text { in } \mathbb { R } ^ { \omega } \text { in the box and product topologies? Justify } } \\ { \text { your answer. } } \end{array} I will first show that $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{\infty}} = \mathbb{R^\omega}$ in the product topology. Indeed, take any $x \in \mathbb{R^\omega}$ and let $U$ be an open set of $\mathbb{R^\omega}$ such that $x \in U$ . Then $U$ contains a basis element $B$ of the product topology such that: $$x \in B = \displaystyle{\prod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_{n}} \subset U $$ and $U_n = \mathbb{R} \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}\setminus F$ where $F$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ . Now, the sequence $(y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ defined by: $$\begin{align*} &y_n = \pi_n(x)  \ \forall n \in F \\ &y_n = 0 \ \forall n \notin F\end{align*}$$ is an element of $B$ , by construction. It follows that $(y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in B \subset U$ , and also by construction we have that $(y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ . Then: $$U \bigcap \mathbb{R}^\infty \neq \emptyset$$ and therefore $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{\infty}} = \mathbb{R^\omega}$ . $\\$ Now I will show that $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{\infty}} = \mathbb{R^\infty}$ in the box topology. For this, it suffices to show that any $x \notin \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ is not in $\overline{\mathbb{R}^{\infty}}$ , and this can be done by showing that there exists an open set $U \ni x$ in the product topology such that $U \bigcap \mathbb{R}^{\infty} = \emptyset$ . Indeed, by definition if $x = (x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \notin \mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ , then there exists an infinite set $I \subset \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_i \neq 0 \ \forall i \in I$ .  Now, for: $$U = \displaystyle{\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}} U_{i} }$$ where $U_i = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \forall i \in I$ and $U_i = \mathbb{R}$ otherwise. As desired, it's clear that $x \in U$ and $U \bigcap \mathbb{R}^{\infty} = \emptyset$ and we're done. Have I made any unnecessary or not entirely correct steps here? Is there anything I should make clearer? EDIT: As I thought, there were some things that could be (and indeed were) improved. Thanks a lot, Brevan and Henno! This kind of thinking is very important and I will always try to bear it in mind so that my proofs are always as clean and clear as possible.","I want  to rid myself of any misunderstandings I have, so feel free to nitpick my attempt all you want so that in the end it's as clear as possible! Now, this is the exercise: I will first show that in the product topology. Indeed, take any and let be an open set of such that . Then contains a basis element of the product topology such that: and where is a finite subset of . Now, the sequence defined by: is an element of , by construction. It follows that , and also by construction we have that . Then: and therefore . Now I will show that in the box topology. For this, it suffices to show that any is not in , and this can be done by showing that there exists an open set in the product topology such that . Indeed, by definition if , then there exists an infinite set such that .  Now, for: where and otherwise. As desired, it's clear that and and we're done.
