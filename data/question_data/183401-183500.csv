Edit Inspired by the contribution made by Mikhail Katz: $\textbf{Proof Sketch 2:}$ Fix $x_0\in X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ . Consider the closed ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ centred in $x_0$ with radius 1: $$B=B[x_0,1]=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:\|x-x_0\|\leq1\}$$ Every closed ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is compact so $B$ is compact and so closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Consider the adherence (closure) of $X$ , this is $\overline{X}$ . Define $L=\overline{X}\cap B=\{x\in \overline{X}:\|x-x_0\|\leq1\}$ . Since $L\subseteq B$ then $L$ is bounded. Since $\overline{X}$ and $B$ are closed and intersection of closed sets is always closed then $L$ is closed. So, by Heine-Borel's Theorem $L$ is compact in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Define $S=X\cap B=\{x\in X:\|x-x_0\|\leq1\}\subseteq X$ . Therefore $S\subseteq L$ and $\overline{S}=L$ ; so $S$ is dense in $L$ . By hypothesis $f$ is continuous in $X\times K$ ; particularly $f$ is continuous in $S\times K$ . Since $S$ is dense in $L$ then $S\times K$ is dense in $L\times K$ . Therefore exist a continuous extension of $f$ from $S\times K$ to $L\times K$ , say $g$ . The set $L\times K$ is a Cartesian product of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ so it's compact in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ . Since $g$ is continuous in $L\times K$ then $g$ is uniformly continuous. For every $\varepsilon>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that if $\|(x_1,\alpha_1)-(x_2,\alpha_2)\|<\delta$ then $\|g(x_1,\alpha_1)-g(x_2,\alpha_2)\|<\varepsilon$ for all $(x_1,\alpha_1),(x_2,\alpha_2)\in L\times K$ . In particular, for $x_1=x\in S$ , $x_2=x_0\in S$ and $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha\in K$ . Suppose: $$\|(x,\alpha)-(x_0,\alpha)\|=\|(x-x_0,\bar{0})\|=\|x-x_0\|<\delta$$ Since $g$ is an extension of $f$ and $x,x_0\in S$ then: $$\|g(x,\alpha)-g(x_0,\alpha)\|=\|f(x,\alpha)-f(x_0,\alpha)\|<\varepsilon$$ for all $\alpha\in K$ . $\textbf{Observation:}$ To guarantee the existence of $g$ it's sufficient that the set $S\times X$ be closed. If not, the statement may not be true. I don't know if this condition is satisfied or not in this context because $X$ is given as a nonempty set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and nothing more about itself. For example, if we had in the hypotheses that $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed then $X=\overline{X}$ and so $L=S$ ; the proof is complete and would be even simpler.","I have the following proposition.

35,"Interpretation of ""Noise"" in Function Optimization","Interpretation of ""Noise"" in Function Optimization",,"I am trying to better understand the meaning of ""noise"" with regards to function optimization - specifically, why ""Noisy"" functions are more difficult to optimize compared to ""Non-Noisy"" functions. Up until now, I always thought of ""noise"" from a signal processing standpoint: for example - how to remove and filter out the noise component from some signal: I also generally think of this in the context of Time Series Analysis, where a time series is separated into non-random components (e.g. seasonal) and random components (e.g. noise): In both of these above cases, ""Noise"" is viewed as something with inherent ""negative connotations"", as something undesirable which is either hindering or further complicating the end goal of (usually) a forecasting or engineering project. However, I am interested in ""noise"" from more of a Machine Learning and Optimization perspective. For instance, (I am not sure if this is correct) I have heard that since the ""loss functions"" of Machine Learning algorithms are always modelling a random variable - thus, any ""loss function"" of a Machine Learning algorithm is always considered to be a ""noisy function"": My Question: Why are ""Noisy"" Functions difficult to optimize compared to ""Non-Noisy"" Functions? I can understand that ""Noisy"" Functions contain ""random noise"" (as the name implies) which alters their ""fidelity"" with regards to the concept they are attempting to represent (i.e. an additional source of ""difficulty"" when attempting to use them for some applied purpose) - but are ""Noisy"" Functions inherent more ""computationally expensive"" to evaluate (e.g. their derivatives) compared to ""Non-Noisy"" and ""Lesser-Noisy"" Functions of similar complexity? How exactly does the ""Noisiness"" of a function contribute to its computational complexity (to the extent that gradient-free methods are often used on ""Noisy"" Functions in order to reduce their ""computational costs"")?

Up until now, I always thought of ""noise"" from a signal processing standpoint: for example - how to remove and filter out the noise component from some signal: I also generally think of this in the context of Time Series Analysis, where a time series is separated into non-random components (e.g. seasonal) and random components (e.g. noise): In both of these above cases, ""Noise"" is viewed as something with inherent ""negative connotations"", as something undesirable which is either hindering or further complicating the end goal of (usually) a forecasting or engineering project. However, I am interested in ""noise"" from more of a Machine Learning and Optimization perspective. For instance, (I am not sure if this is correct) I have heard that since the ""loss functions"" of Machine Learning algorithms are always modelling a random variable - thus, any ""loss function"" of a Machine Learning algorithm is always considered to be a ""noisy function"": My Question: Why are ""Noisy"" Functions difficult to optimize compared to ""Non-Noisy"" Functions? I can understand that ""Noisy"" Functions contain ""random noise"" (as the name implies) which alters their ""fidelity"" with regards to the concept they are attempting to represent (i.e. an additional source of ""difficulty"" when attempting to use them for some applied purpose) - but are ""Noisy"" Functions inherent more ""computationally expensive"" to evaluate (e.g. their derivatives) compared to ""Non-Noisy"" and ""Lesser-Noisy"" Functions of similar complexity?

Let $y = f(x)$ be curve such that at a point $(a,b)$ lying on it, the slope of the tangent kissing that point is $f'(x)$ Now, the equation of the tangent passing through $(a,b)$ is found using the point-slope equation: $$y - b = f'(x)(x-a)$$ But this would be the same equation I would get if I were asked to substitute the point and slope to find the equation of the curve. Now, I know that the point slope form is for straight lines but I think this should be extendable to any curve because all curves just have variable slopes. Maybe this is stupid and may not work. Could someone tell me why this is so? Here's a demonstration of the point slope not yielding back the curve: $$y=2(x−5)^2 +5 \stackrel{\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx}\text{ing}}{\implies} y' = 4(x-5)$$ It can clearly be seen that the point $(5,5)$ satisfies the given curve.

For any positive $\alpha$ we have a linear solution given by $f(x) = kx,$ with $$k=-\frac12 + \frac{\sqrt{1+4\alpha}}2>0.$$ Suppose there is another solution $g(x)$ such that, for some $a_0>0$ , $g(a_0) < ka_0$ , i.e., $g(a_0) = (k-\varepsilon_0) a_0,$ with $0 < \varepsilon_0 < k$ .

Prove that there is a function $g$ such that $f \circ g = I$ I think I do understand this question and how to solve it, but I'm struggling to find a way to express my solution in a mathematically rigorous way, particularly when $f$ is not injective. Here's my idea: First of all, if $f$ is injective, then it's trivial. Let $g(x) = a$ , where $x = f(a)$ for any $a \in \text{domain}(f)$ Since $f$ is injective, by definition there is only one value of $a$ that satisfies $x = f(a)$ for each $x$ , which means $g$ is well defined. And $\text{domain}(g) = \text{image}(f)$ (by definition of $g$ ), which from the supposition in the question is $\mathbb{R}$ . Also, $\text{domain}(f) = \text{image}(g)$ , since $f$ and $g$ are injective (but that fact is not important). So $f(g(x))$ is defined for all $x ∈ \mathbb{R}$ . Finally, $f(g(x))$ = $f(a)$ , where $x = f(a)$ for $x ∈ \mathbb{R} \to f(g(x)) = I(x)$ . But now if $f$ is not injective, it gets more complicated. If I keep my original definition of $g$ , being "" $g(x) = a$ , where $x = f(a)$ for any $a \in \text{domain}(f)$ "", then that doesn't work because $g$ is no longer a function. Because since $f$ is not injective, there exists atleast 2 numbers $z$ and $w$ such that $z \neq w$ but $f(z) = f(w)$ , which means there exists $x$ such that: $g(x) = z = w$ . I think the idea is to simply redefine $g$ to simply ""choose"" either $z$ or $w$ , and assign it to $x$ . For example it could choose the smaller of the two. The only difference this would make is now $\text{domain}(f) \subset \text{image}(g)$ , instead of $\text{domain}(f) = \text{image}(g)$ . But since that fact wasn't important before, the conclusion in the question still holds. Here's my question. How do I explicitly write down a definition of $g$ that ""chooses"" the smaller of $z$ or $w$ ? Furthermore, recall there exists at least 2 numbers z and w. There could be arbitrarily more numbers such that $f(z) = f(w) = f(m) = f(n)$ and so on. And that's just one of the arbitrary branches the common values $f$ could take.

72,Problem with Ordered Triples,Problem with Ordered Triples,,"I have been doing set theory for a while, and for a long time I have understood Kuratowski's inductive definition for ordered $n$-tuples: $(x_1,x_2) := \{\{x_1\},\{x_1,x_2\}\}$ $(x_1,x_2,...,x_{k+1}) := ((x_1,x_2,...,x_k),x_{k+1})$ Pretty quickly I understood and accepted the beautiful result that $(x_1,...,x_n) = (y_1,...,y_n)$ if and only if $x_i = y_i$ for all $i \in \{1,...,n\}$, so I moved on and accepted this definition, thinking about ordered n-tuples as abstract objects again - happy that the set theory under the hood was working as it was supposed to. But today I noticed a problem with this definition that I didn't see, and it is to do with ordered triples (or ordered $n$-tuples for $n \geq 3$ to be honest). Given two arbitrary sets $a$ and $b$, the ordered triple $(a,a,b)$ is defined as $((a,a),b) = \{\{\color{blue}{(a,a)}\},\{\color{blue}{(a,a)},b\}\} = \{\{\color{blue}{\{\{a\}\}}\},\{\color{blue}{\{\{a\}\}},b\}\}$. In other words $(a,a,b) = (\{\{a\}\},b)$, and this holds for all sets. Now usually we don't have a domain which includes both $a$ and $\{\{a\}\}$ (or it is clear if we are talking about ordered pairs vs ordered triples), so the distinction is usually clear. But in abstract mathematics that is certainly not always the case. For example take the set $X = \{ \{\},\{\{\}\},\{\{\{\}\}\},...\}$. Then we can imagine the set of arbitrarily long $n$-tuples of $X$, the set $Y = \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}(\prod_{i=1}^k X)$. Then because of the above situation, many very simple and intuitive functions just straight up can't be defined. Take the function $P_3 \colon Y \to X \cup \{*\}$ given by $P_3(x_1,...,x_k) = \begin{cases} x_3 &\mbox{if } k \geq 3 \\  * & \mbox{if } k < 3 \end{cases}$ where the set $*$ is some set not contained in $X$. Straight away we run into problems as $P_3(\{\},\{\},\{\}) = \{\}$ and $P_3(\{\{\{\}\}\},\{\}) = *$, which gives us $P_3(\{\},\{\},\{\}) \neq P_3(\{\{\{\}\}\},\{\})$. This is a problem because under Kuratowski's definition of ordered $n$-tuples, we have that $(\{\},\{\},\{\}) = (\{\{\{\}\}\},\{\})$. I know that there are alternative definitions for ordered $n$-tuples, for example a definition such as: $(\color{red}{x_1},\color{blue}{x_2},\color{green}{x_3},...,x_k) := \{\color{red}{\{x_1\}},\color{blue}{\{x_2,\{x_2\}\}},\color{green}{\{x_3,\{x_3\},\{\{x_3\}\}\}},...\}$ where the $i$th entry nests $i-1$ times would solve this problem (at least when the axiom of regularity holds), but since Kuratowski's definition is so widely accepted there must be something I am overlooking. I would love to know why this is not an issue in general mathematics. EDIT: As (somewhat) pointed out in the comments, an even better definition for ordered $n$-tuples would be: $(x_1,...,x_n) := \{\{n\}, \{n, (x_1,...,x_n)_K\}\}$, where $(x_1,...,x_n)_K$ is Kuratowski's definition of ordered $n$-tuples as this solves the problem and holds even in the absence of the axiom of regularity . And even though it has been mentioned that this definition seems to depend on a prior construction of the natural numbers (i.e. the axiom of infinity ), I would disagree as this is an inductive definition - allowing you to define each $n$ sequentially at each inductive step, and does not require the set $\mathbb{N}$ to exist.","I have been doing set theory for a while, and for a long time I have understood Kuratowski's inductive definition for ordered $n$-tuples: $(x_1,x_2) := \{\{x_1\},\{x_1,x_2\}\}$ $(x_1,x_2,...,x_{k+1}) := ((x_1,x_2,...,x_k),x_{k+1})$ Pretty quickly I understood and accepted the beautiful result that $(x_1,...,x_n) = (y_1,...,y_n)$ if and only if $x_i = y_i$ for all $i \in \{1,...,n\}$, so I moved on and accepted this definition, thinking about ordered n-tuples as abstract objects again - happy that the set theory under the hood was working as it was supposed to.

Proof by contradiction: If $f: A→B$ and $n(A) < n(B)$, $f$ is onto. Since, by definition of a function, $a∈A$ cannot be mapped to more than one value $b∈B$. This means that $f$ is not onto since $n(A)$ cannot be less than $n(B)$, which violates the contradiction. To me, this explanation seems simple yet complete enough to constitute a proof to the theorem. But the given solution to this problem is as follows: If we assume that $f$ is onto, then the range is $f(A) = B$ so $n(f(A)) = n(B)$. Knowing that $n(A) ≥ n(f(A))$, yields the expression: $n(A) ≥ n(f(A)) = n(B)$. However this is a contradiction to the fact that $n(A) < n(B)$, so $f$ is not onto.
