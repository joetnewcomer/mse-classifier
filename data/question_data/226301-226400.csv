Moreover, $\dim V_i = \dim k[X_1, \dots, X_n]/\mathfrak p$ for all $i$. Conversely let $W$ be an irreducible algebraic set in $\bar k^n$. Then the $G$-orbit $\{\sigma(W)\colon \sigma \in G\}$ is finite. Let $V = \bigcup_{\sigma\in G} \sigma(W)$. Then there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $k[X_1, \dots, X_n]$ such that $V$ is the algebraic set defined by $\mathfrak p$.",,['algebraic-geometry']

The ideal generated by $S$ is $\langle S\rangle_R:=\bigcap\{J; S\subseteq J\unlhd R\}$, i.e. the intersection of all ideals of $R$ that contain $S$. If $R'\subseteq R$ are commutative rings and $S\subseteq R'$, then clearly $\langle S\rangle_{R'}\subseteq\langle S\rangle_R$. We also have $\langle S\rangle_R\!=\!\langle S'\rangle_R\Leftrightarrow S\!\subseteq\!\langle S'\rangle_R, S'\!\subseteq\!\langle S\rangle_R$, a useful criterium when checking concrete cases. An easy exercise shows that $\langle S\rangle_R\!=\!\sum RS$, i.e. the set of all finite sums of elements of the form $rs$, where $r\!\in\!R, s\!\in\!S$. In particular, $\langle s_1,\ldots,s_k\rangle_R\!=\!Rs_1+\ldots+Rs_k$. The radical of $I$ is $\sqrt{I}:=\{r\in R; \;\exists n\!\in\!\mathbb{N}: r^n\!\in\!I\}\unlhd R$. Clearly $I\subseteq\sqrt{I}$ and $I\subseteq J\Rightarrow \sqrt{I}\subseteq\sqrt{J}$. The colon ideal is $I:S:=\{r\!\in\!R;\; rS\!\subseteq\!I\}\unlhd R$. Clearly $I:S=I:\langle S\rangle_R$.

I think the actual question might want to restrict to finite Laurent series, but I don't think it matters: I'm pretty sure what I want to do is figure out what each homogeneous component is allowed to look like.  Moreover, I'm pretty sure that by plugging in $h=k=1$ I get that all the coefficients in nonnegative degrees need to be integral, so the first place to look is in degree $-1$. So suppose we have \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 u}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 v}. \end{equation*}  Then \begin{equation*}f(ht,kt)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 ht}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 kt} = \frac{a_1 b_2 k+b_1 a_2 h}{a_2b_2hkt};\end{equation*} for this to lie in $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm},1/h,1/k]$ we need $a_2b_2|a_1b_2k+b_1a_2 h$.  I believe it's a basic fact that since this has to be true for all nonzero $h$ and $k$, we need that $a_2b_2|gcd(a_1b_2,b_1a_2)$.  This implies that $a_2b_2|a_1b_2 \Rightarrow a_2|a_1$ and similarly $b_2|b_1$.  But assuming we started with our fractions in reduced form, this implies that $a_2=b_2=1$; that is, $f(u,v)_{-1}\in \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm}]$. Since I don't think I gained much insight from that calculation, I just tried to find restrictions on \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-2}=\frac{a_1}{a_2u^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2uv}+\frac{c_1}{c_2v^2}. \end{equation*}  Now we have \begin{equation*} f(ht,kt)_{-2} = \frac{a_1}{a_2 h^2t^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 hkt^2} + \frac{c_1}{c_2 k^2t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2hkc_2k^2 + b_1a_2h^2c_2k^2 + c_1a_2h^2 b_2hk}{a_2b_2c_2h^3k^3t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2c_2k^2 + b_1a_2c_2hk + c_1a_2b_2h^2}{a_2b_2c_2h^2k^2t^2},\end{equation*} and what we need is for $a_2b_2c_2|a_1b_2c_2k^2+b_1a_2c_2hk+c_1a_2b_2h^2$ (for all $h$ and $k$, of course).  This is where I'm stuck.  Reducing mod $a_2$ and recalling that $gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$ we should get that $a_2|b_2c_2k^2$, and similarly $b_2|a_2c_2hk$ and $c_2|a_2b_2h^2$.  Putting $h=k=1$ this means that $a_2|b_2c_2$, $b_2|a_2c_2$, and $c_2|a_2b_2$.  I tried breaking down these conditions into conditions on the prime factorizations but didn't get very far.  And in any case, numbers that satisfy these need not satisfy the original relation.  Help please???? Motivation: In case you're still reading and you're wondering why I care about this specific calculation, it's because it's closely related to the ""$K$-theoretic homology of $K$-theory""; precisely, it's the image of $K_*K\rightarrow K_*K\otimes \mathbb{Q}$.  This is important because for any (co)homology theory $E$, the $E$-cohomology of $E$ (written $E^*E$) is exactly the algebra of stable cohomology operations, and with some additional assumtions on $E$ (which are satisfied by $K$-theory), the $E$-homology of $E$ is the coalgebra of stable homology cooperations.

So suppose we have \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 u}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 v}. \end{equation*}  Then \begin{equation*}f(ht,kt)_{-1}=\frac{a_1}{a_2 ht}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 kt} = \frac{a_1 b_2 k+b_1 a_2 h}{a_2b_2hkt};\end{equation*} for this to lie in $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm},1/h,1/k]$ we need $a_2b_2|a_1b_2k+b_1a_2 h$.  I believe it's a basic fact that since this has to be true for all nonzero $h$ and $k$, we need that $a_2b_2|gcd(a_1b_2,b_1a_2)$.  This implies that $a_2b_2|a_1b_2 \Rightarrow a_2|a_1$ and similarly $b_2|b_1$.  But assuming we started with our fractions in reduced form, this implies that $a_2=b_2=1$; that is, $f(u,v)_{-1}\in \mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm}]$. Since I don't think I gained much insight from that calculation, I just tried to find restrictions on \begin{equation*} f(u,v)_{-2}=\frac{a_1}{a_2u^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2uv}+\frac{c_1}{c_2v^2}. \end{equation*}  Now we have \begin{equation*} f(ht,kt)_{-2} = \frac{a_1}{a_2 h^2t^2}+\frac{b_1}{b_2 hkt^2} + \frac{c_1}{c_2 k^2t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2hkc_2k^2 + b_1a_2h^2c_2k^2 + c_1a_2h^2 b_2hk}{a_2b_2c_2h^3k^3t^2} \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} = \frac{a_1b_2c_2k^2 + b_1a_2c_2hk + c_1a_2b_2h^2}{a_2b_2c_2h^2k^2t^2},\end{equation*} and what we need is for $a_2b_2c_2|a_1b_2c_2k^2+b_1a_2c_2hk+c_1a_2b_2h^2$ (for all $h$ and $k$, of course).  This is where I'm stuck.  Reducing mod $a_2$ and recalling that $gcd(a_1,a_2)=1$ we should get that $a_2|b_2c_2k^2$, and similarly $b_2|a_2c_2hk$ and $c_2|a_2b_2h^2$.  Putting $h=k=1$ this means that $a_2|b_2c_2$, $b_2|a_2c_2$, and $c_2|a_2b_2$.  I tried breaking down these conditions into conditions on the prime factorizations but didn't get very far.  And in any case, numbers that satisfy these need not satisfy the original relation.  Help please???? Motivation: In case you're still reading and you're wondering why I care about this specific calculation, it's because it's closely related to the ""$K$-theoretic homology of $K$-theory""; precisely, it's the image of $K_*K\rightarrow K_*K\otimes \mathbb{Q}$.  This is important because for any (co)homology theory $E$, the $E$-cohomology of $E$ (written $E^*E$) is exactly the algebra of stable cohomology operations, and with some additional assumtions on $E$ (which are satisfied by $K$-theory), the $E$-homology of $E$ is the coalgebra of stable homology cooperations.  Furthermore, the $e$-invariant is a homomorphism from the stable homotopy groups of spheres to a subquotient of $K_*K$!",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology']"

(ii) I use the map in part (i) to prove this part. Let $\pi_Y$ is the projection from $X \times Y \to Y$ , it is not hard to see that $\pi_Y \circ \varphi$ is the identity over $Y$ . Then $(\pi_Y \circ \varphi)^*=\varphi^* \circ \pi_Y^*$ is also the identity over $\mathcal{O}_Y(Y)$ , which tells that $\varphi^*$ is an isomorphism having the inverse $\pi_Y^*$ , and thus an isomorphism between the two $k$ -algebras mentioned in the statement.

68,Finite covers of $X$ and continuous profinite group actions,Finite covers of  and continuous profinite group actions,X,"I have a question that is related to the one here , but I found the answer there unsatisfactory and kind of confusing. For context, we are considering the action of the fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$ on the fiber $p^{-1}(x)$ of some finite connected cover $p:Y\rightarrow X$ . The proof is from Corollary 2.3.9 of Szamuely's book, showing an equivalence of categories of finite covers of $X$ with the category of finite continuous left $\hat{\pi}_1(X,x)$ -sets, where $\hat{\pi}_1(X,x)$ is the profinite completion of $\pi_1(X,x)$ . Here's the result from the text: For a finite connected cover $p\colon Y\rightarrow X$ the action of $\pi_1 (X,x)$ on $p^{-1}(x)$ factors through a finite quotient, so we obtain an action of $\hat{\pi}_1 (X,x)$ as well. The stabilizer of each point $y\in Y$ [ $y\in p^{-1}(x)$ ] is a subgroup of finite index, and hence contains a normal subgroup of finite index by the lemma. Therefore the stabilizer of $y$ under the action of $\hat{\pi}_1 (X,x)$ is an open subgroup in the profinite topology (being a union of cosets of an open normal subgroup), which means that the action is continuous. Conversely, a continuous action of $\hat{\pi}_1(X,x)$ on a finite set factors through a finite quotient which is also a quotient of $\pi_1(X,x)$ , and as such gives rise to a finite cover $Y\rightarrow X$ .

The answer I linked above says that we can see that the projection $\hat{\pi}_1(X,x)\rightarrow \hat{\pi}_1(X,x)/N$ is continuous where the image has the discrete topology, but it seems to me that the argument then implies that any normal $N$ with finite index in a profinite group would be open, which I don't think is true.

Here I have some problems thinking about how should look maximal ideals in R. Also I have another idea that probably works, this is to use the fact that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal ideals in and points in .

The Zariski tangent space $T_xZ$ is (almost by definition) the kernel of $J_x$ , meaning that $$T_xZ = \bigcap_{i=1}^m\ker f_i'(x)\ ,$$ while the tangent cone $C_x(Z)$ is defined to be the common zero locus of all initial terms of polynomials in $\mathcal{I}(Z)$ : for all $f\in \mathcal{I}(Z)$ , denote by $f^\ast_x$ the first non-zero term in the Taylor expansion of $f$ at $x$ ( $f^\ast_x$ is therefore a symmetric $r$ -linear form on $k^n$ ) and define $$C_x(Z) = \lbrace h\in k^n\ |\ f^\ast_x(h,\ldots,h)=0\rbrace.$$ Since $f'_i(x)$ is the initial term of $f_i$ for all $i\in\lbrace 1,\ldots,m\rbrace$ , we always have $C_x(Z)\subset T_xZ$ .

Since the linear forms $(f_1'(x),\ldots,f_m'(x))$ are linearly independent, the linear term of $f$ at $x$ is $0$ if and only if $a_i(x)=0$ for all $i \in\lbrace 1,\ldots,m \rbrace$ . Can we use this to say something about the initial term of $f$ at $x$ ? Is this initial term necessarily $0$ on $(h,\ldots,h)$ if $h\in\ker J_x$ ? Notes Maybe using the Taylor expansion in place of changing the coordinates in order to be able to assume that $x=0$ makes things more complicated: if we do change coordinates and assume that $x=0$ , then we can just think of the Taylor expansion as the decomposition of $f$ into homogeneous components and the initial term is just the non-zero homogeneous component of lowest degree.

I've solved it in a half, but have stuck on the next question: how to find an ideal $I(V)$ of an variety $V$ ? Mainly, in the exercise there is an affine variety $$ V = \mathbf{V}(y^2-xz, z-x^2), $$ which I'm particularly interested in. I've already seen the pages on M.SE with similar question, e.g. this one , but I don't really understand why we just assume that the field is algebraically closed and then use Nullstellensatz. In the exercise there's nothing on this, and it seems it's assumed to be solved without Nullstellensatz. So how can one find an ideal of variety? Earlier in the book, D. Cox solves a similar exercise (p. 33). There, D. Cox wants to show that $$ I(V) = I(\mathbf{V}(y-x^2, z-x^3)) = \left<y-x^2, z-x^3\right>. $$ In order to do this, he factors $f \in I(V)$ by the generators, so $$ f = h_1(y-x^2) + h_2(z-x^3) + r, $$ such that $r$ is actually from $k[x]$ .

If $\omega$ is any non-zero differential form of $K$ , then we know that its degree is $2g_K-2$ . Such a form can be written as $ydx$ , with $x,y\in K$ . We can also view $x,y$ as elements of $E$ ; we can compute the degree in $E$ , and compare it with that in $K$ to the formula, as follows. Let $P$ be a point of $K$ , and let $t$ be a local parameter at $P$ , that is an element of order $1$ at $P$ in $K$ . If $u$ is a local parameter at $Q$ , then $$t=u^ev,$$ where $v$ is a unit at $Q$ . Furthermore, $dt=u^edv+eu^{e-1}vdu$ .

I don't see why, since: $$\sum_Q\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=\sum_Q e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+\sum_Q(e_Q-1)$$ Hence, in order to finish the prove we need that $\sum_Q\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=2g_E-2$ and $\sum_Q e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)=n(2g_K-2)$ , but none of this formulas seems trivial to me.

(As a extra, if someone can write the whole proof with all the details I will be very grateful.)","k K k E K n g_E g_K E K P K Q E P e_Q k 2g_E-2=n(2g_K-2)+\sum_Q (e_Q-1). \omega K 2g_K-2 ydx x,y\in K x,y E E K P K t P 1 P K u Q t=u^ev, v Q dt=u^edv+eu^{e-1}vdu \operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=e_Q\cdot\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+(e_Q-1).

99,Question about tensor product of algebras,Question about tensor product of algebras,,"Take two ring homomorphism, $a:R\to A$ and $ b:R\to B$ . In general, there is not a field $F$ such that $A,B\hookrightarrow F$ , and such that $R\to A \hookrightarrow F$ and $R\to B \hookrightarrow F$ are the same (as ring homomorphisms). However I don't understand why such a field doesn't always exist: if I consider the tensor product of algebras $A\otimes_RB$ , and take its quotient by a maximal ideal, isn't the result a field containing a copy of $A$ and $B$ , with the inclusions equalizing $a$ and $b$ ? Thanks for any clarify","Take two ring homomorphism, and . In general, there is not a field such that , and such that and are the same (as ring homomorphisms).
