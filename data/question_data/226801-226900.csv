16,proof: projecting a projective variety onto the first component remains a projective variety,proof: projecting a projective variety onto the first component remains a projective variety,,"I have recently begun studying algebraic geometry and have decided to start with Harris' classic, supplementing it with these online notes from a lecture, based on his book, given by Harris himself at Harvard in 2016. These lecture notes have turned out to be incredibly helpful in filling in the details, often missing in Harris' book. Currently, I am working on the $11$ th lecture of the course at Harvard (which, in turn, becomes lecture $3$ in the book), and have a question regarding the proof of Lemma $11.6$ of the lecture notes linked above. The claim reads: Suppose $X \subset Y \times \mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety and $\pi : Y \times \mathbb{P}^n \to Y$ . Then, $\pi(X) \subset Y$ is a projective variety. I reproduce the proof included in the lecture notes: Proof. The idea is to use induction on $n$ . The base case is Lemma $11.5$ [The statement for $n=1$ has already been shown]. We will choose a point $p \in \mathbb{P}^n$ and a hyperplane $H \cong \mathbb{P}^{n−1} \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ . We consider the projection map $$\eta:= \text{id}\times\pi_p  :Y\times (\mathbb{P}^n\setminus\{p\})\to Y\times \mathbb{P}^{n−1}$$ So, by induction, it suffices to show the following lemma. Lemma 11.7. With notation as above, $\eta(X) \subset Y \times \mathbb{P}^{n−1}$ is a projective variety. Proof. We’d like to just say the image of a projective variety is a projective variety. The only problem is that the variety can’t contain the point. However, it may be that the cross section $p$ intersects the variety $X$ . This works away from the locus of points in $Y$ where $p$ intersects the fiber of $X$ . That is, define $$V = \{q \in Y : (q, p) \in X\}$$ This is a closed subvariety of $X$ . We just restrict the equations defining $X$ to $Y × {p}$ . Note that $\pi(X)\cap Y\setminus V$ is closed in $Y\setminus V$ and $V\subset \pi(X)$ .

Yet in our setting, it is $\eta = id \times \pi_p$ we are dealing with, so Lemma $11.1$ cannot be applied directly. I tried adapting its proof to this case, but the Zariski topolgy on the product $Y\times \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ coming from Segre's embedding makes it too difficult.

Let $A=k[X_1,\dotsc,X_n,X_1^{-1},\dotsc,X_n^{-1}]$ be the algebra of Laurent polynomials in the variables $X_1,\dotsc,X_n$ over $k$ . Let $B=A/I$ where $I$ is an ideal of $A$ . Is there necessarily a subring $B_0$ of $B$ such that $B$ is integral over $B_0$ , and $B_0$ is isomorphic to $k[Y_1,\dotsc,Y_t,Y_1^{-1},\dotsc,Y_t^{-1}]$ for some $t\geq 0$ ? In other words, I am looking for something like the Noether normalization theorem, but for Laurent polynomial algebras rather than polynomial algeras. Edit (possible strategies): Since $A/I$ is a finitely generated $k$ -algebra, Noether normalization says that $A/I$ is integral over a subring isomorphic to a polynomial algebra over $k$ in $d$ variables. I can prove that $A$ has Krull dimension $n$ , and so $d \leq n$ . Not sure if that helps because I don't see how to extend the polynomial algebra to a Laurent polynomia algebra, and I see no reason for this to be possible in general. Maybe we can consider the subring $A'=k[X_1,\dotsc,X_n]$ of $A$ , and the ideal $I\cap A'$ of $A'$ . Then $B'=A'/I\cap A'$ is integral over a polynomial subalgebra $B'_0$ . We can view $B'$ as a subalgebra of $B$ , and now my idea is to localize by inverting $X_1,\dotsc,X_n$ , but that doesn't seem to bring us to the desired conclusion. Maybe we can imitate the proof of Noether normalization? Say assuming that $k$ is infinite because then the proof is simpler and a linear change of variables works to prove Noether normalization. The proof is inductive, adding on generator of the polynomial algebra at a time. But this is unlikely to work, because a ""generic"" Laurent polynomial is not invertible, while the usual proof of Noether normalization works by showing that a generic element works as the next generator of the polynomia subalgebra. Maybe a geometric intuition would work? Say $k=\mathbb{C}$ (I know that algebraic geometry is more general, but I don't understand it well yet). Well, in that case, $A$ corresponds to the subset $V$ of $\mathbb{A}^n$ of points where no coordinate is $0$ . Now, $A/I$ corresponds to a subset of $V$ . A subring of $A/I$ isomorphic to an algebra of Laurent polynomials will correspond to a map onto an algebraic set similar to $V$ (but possibly of a lower dimension) with finite fibers (finite fibers is not enough for integrality, but I'm just gaining intuition). So I can start with ordinary noether normalization to obtain an integral map to $\mathbb{A}^d$ for some $d$ , and then hopefully tweak things such that no point with a zero coordinate is in the image.","Let be a field and .

21,Why pullback of ideal sheaf should be the conormal sheaf?,Why pullback of ideal sheaf should be the conormal sheaf?,,"I'm sorry that this isn't really a math question, but this gap between my intuition and the truth bothers me. For closed subvariety (for simplicity) with ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}$ , the pullback $i^*(\mathcal{I}/\mathcal{I}^2)$ is equal to $i^*(\mathcal{I})$ and this is a conormal sheaf. However, my interpretation of an ideal sheaf was 'functions vanishing at the subvariety', for example, it corresponds to just $I$ when the subvariety is $V(I)$ in the affine case. Therefore I thought it would be more reasonable for the pullback to be either zero (as $I$ vanishes on subvariety) or just $I$ itself (which formally doesn't make sense). In other words, it feels 'very lucky' to me that pullback suddenly sees only 'first-order terms'.

27,Is galois cohomology invariant under inner forms and not just pure inner forms?,Is galois cohomology invariant under inner forms and not just pure inner forms?,,"Let $G, G'$ be smooth algebraic groups over $k$ (absolute Galois group $\Gamma$ ) which are etale inner forms of each other, that is, there exists an isomorphism $G_{k_s} \cong G'_{k_s}$ and the associated torsor for the automorphism group is in the image of the natural map $H^1(k, G/Z_G) \to H^1(k, \operatorname{Aut}_G)$ . My question is about the truth of the following proposition: Proposition: Each inner isomorphism $G_{k_s} \cong G'_{k_s}$ induces a bijection $H^1(k, G) \xrightarrow{\sim} H^1(k, G')$ . Is this true as stated, or only for pure inner forms? Does it follow if we make any further assumptions on $G$ (affine, reductive, semisimple . . .)? This is asserted a few places, e.g. the answer here . However, the linked proof here (as in Serre's Cohomologie Galoisienne ), only works for pure inner forms, i.e. those corresponding to cocycles that factor through $H^1(k, G) \to H^1(k, G/Z_G) \to H^1(k, \operatorname{Aut}_G)$ . Proof for pure inner forms The argument, as I understand it, goes as follows. Proof for pure inner forms: Let $s \in \Gamma \mapsto g_s \in G(k_s)$ be a Galois cocycle in $H^1(k, G)$ , with associated cocycle valued in $\operatorname{Aut}_G$ given by conjugation, $s \mapsto \left(h \mapsto g_s h g_s^{-1}\right)$ . Let $G'$ be the pure inner form of $G$ defined by this latter cocycle. In particular, $G'(k_s) = G(k_s)$ , and the two galois actions are related by $s \cdot'(g) = g_s(s \cdot g) g_s^{-1}$ . We define a map $H^1(k, G) \to H^1(k, G')$ on cocycles now as follows: given $s \mapsto a_s \in G(k_s) = G'(k_s)$ a cocycle for the $G$ -Galois action, we can define a cocycle for the $G'$ -Galois action by $s \mapsto b_s := a_s g_s^{-1}$ . This is indeed a cocycle: $$ b_{s} s \cdot'(b_t) = a_s g_s^{-1} g_s(s \cdot(a_t g_t^{-1})) g_s^{-1} = a_s s \cdot(a_t) \; g_{st}^{-1} = a_{st} g_{st}^{-1}, $$ easily seen to descend to $H^1(k, G)$ , and has inverse given by right multiplication by $g_s$ instead. QED. My Thoughts In the proof above, if $s \mapsto g_s \in (G/Z_G)(k_s) = G(k_s)/Z_G(k_s)$ is valued in the inner automorphism group, then the expression $s \mapsto b_s = a_s g_s^{-1}$ is only well-defined up to an element of the center, and the failure of the identity $g_s s(g_t) = g_{st}$ at the level of $G$ (which was used in checking $b_s$ was a cocycle) is measured by a 2-cocycle valued in $Z_G$ . If this 2-cocycle is not a coboundary, we should not expect to be able to choose a cocycle lifting the $g_s$ to $G(k_s)$ . In other words, we should run into the difficulty that the map $H^1(k, G) \to H^1(k, G/Z_G)$ is rarely surjective, fitting into the LES $$ H^1(k, Z_G) \longrightarrow H^1(k, G) \longrightarrow H^1(k, G/Z_G) \longrightarrow H^2(k, Z_G). $$ For $\operatorname{GL}_n$ , for example, $Z_G = \mathbb{G}_m$ , and so the Brauer group provides an obstruction to lifting cocycles from $\operatorname{PGL}_n$ to $\operatorname{GL}_n$ . I haven't been able to construct a counterexample among the forms of $\operatorname{GL}_n$ , however.","Let be smooth algebraic groups over (absolute Galois group ) which are etale inner forms of each other, that is, there exists an isomorphism and the associated torsor for the automorphism group is in the image of the natural map .

49,Intersection of subspace of cyclical rotations with orthant,Intersection of subspace of cyclical rotations with orthant,,"In an $N$ -dimensional real Euclidian space, let an orthant be specified by a vector $\underline{x}_0 = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\}$ where the components $x_k$ are binary in  the sense that $x_k = \pm 1$ . Now let $\underline{x}_j$ be cyclical rotations of  that vector $\underline{x}_0$ , such that the components are $x_{k+j}$ where the indices are understood modulo $N$ .  Span a space of vectors $V = {\rm span} \{ \underline{x}_1, \underline{x}_2, \dots, \underline{x}_d \} $ . What is the minimum number of $d$ such that $V$ intersects the original orthant indicated by $\underline{x}_0$ ? This question can either be understood when notion of the original $\underline{x}_0$ is available, or in an average sense over randomly picked $\underline{x}_0$ where $N$ is large. In the latter case, it is reasonable to make the vector $\underline{x}_0$ almost mean-free, i.e. by imposing $|\sum_{k=1}^N x_k| \le 1$ . Also, conditions on $N$ may be useful, i.e. demanding that $N$ is prime. Background 1 : If the vectors $ \{ \underline{x}_1, \underline{x}_2, \dots, \underline{x}_d \} $ were randomly picked and in general position, it is known that, as $N$ turns large, the probability of the span intersecting any particular orthant approaches 1 as $d \ge 0.50 N$ (Thomas Cover, Geometrical and Statistical Properties of Systems of Linear Threshold Devices, 1964). In the present non-random but cyclical case, although the vectors could still be assumed in general position, the probability of the span intersecting the original orthant is, by large scale simulations, known to approach 1 as $d \ge 0.59 N$ , i.e. the subspace dimensionality $d$ must be ca. 18 % larger.  (M. Schröder, W. Kinzel and I. Kanter: Training a perceptron by a bit sequence: storage capacity, J. Phys. A 29 7965-7972, 1996). To my knowledge, there is no explanation for this published. Background 2 : One could demand a stronger condition, namely that $\underline{x}_0 = \sum_{j=1}^d w_j \underline{x}_j$ holds, with freely chosen $w_j$ . However, it can be shown by Discrete Fourier Transformation that this condition can be met only in very special cases, and when $N$ is prime and $\underline{x}_0$ is almost mean-free, it is impossible to achieve. The argument is the following: Let $\bf{W}$ be a circulant matrix where the generating vector is composed from the components $w_j$ , and otherwise zero. Then the condition is equivalent to $\bf{W} \cdot \underline{x}_0 = \underline{x}_0 $ . Let $\bf{I}$ be the unit matrix and $\underline{0}$ be a vector of zeros, then equivalently $(\bf{W} - \bf{I})\cdot \underline{x}_0  = \underline{0}$ . So $\bf{V}  = \bf{W} - \bf{I}$ is also a circulant and we have $\bf{V} \cdot \underline{x}_0  = \underline{0}$ . Taking DFTs, $ \underline{\hat x} = {\rm{DFT}}(\underline{x}_0 )$ and $\bf{\Lambda}$ is the diagonal (since $\bf{V} $ is circulant) matrix of eigenvalues of $\bf{V} $ . So, after taking DFT, we have $\bf{\Lambda} \cdot \underline{\hat x}= \underline{0}$ . In components, we have that $\lambda_j {\hat x}_j = 0$ . Now if $N$ is prime, all DFT components ${\hat x}_j $ are nonzero (for a proof see here ), which means that it is required that all $\lambda_j = 0$ . This is only possible if all $v_j =0$ , in other words, $w_0 = 1$ and all other $w_j = 0$ . However, the task has it that $w_0 = 0$ , so this condition cannot be met. If $N$ is not prime, it is still possible that (almost) all DFT components ${\hat x}_j $ are nonzero, so a similar argument holds. Background 3 : Following the discussion above, the span $V$ intersects the original orthant indicated by $\underline{x}_0$ if we define a diagonal matrix $\bf{A}$ with positive elements only, and $(\bf{W} - \bf{A})\cdot \underline{x}_0  = \underline{0}$ . So $\bf{V}  = \bf{W} - \bf{A}$ is a ""circulant plus diagonal"", which is disturbing the argument in Background 2.  This may be a handle to augment the discussion in Background 2 with a perturbation treatment.","In an -dimensional real Euclidian space, let an orthant be specified by a vector where the components are binary in  the sense that . Now let be cyclical rotations of  that vector , such that the components are where the indices are understood modulo .  Span a space of vectors . What is the minimum number of such that intersects the original orthant indicated by ? This question can either be understood when notion of the original is available, or in an average sense over randomly picked where is large. In the latter case, it is reasonable to make the vector almost mean-free, i.e. by imposing . Also, conditions on may be useful, i.e. demanding that is prime. Background 1 : If the vectors were randomly picked and in general position, it is known that, as turns large, the probability of the span intersecting any particular orthant approaches 1 as (Thomas Cover, Geometrical and Statistical Properties of Systems of Linear Threshold Devices, 1964). In the present non-random but cyclical case, although the vectors could still be assumed in general position, the probability of the span intersecting the original orthant is, by large scale simulations, known to approach 1 as , i.e. the subspace dimensionality must be ca. 18 % larger.  (M. Schröder, W. Kinzel and I. Kanter: Training a perceptron by a bit sequence: storage capacity, J. Phys. A 29 7965-7972, 1996). To my knowledge, there is no explanation for this published. Background 2 : One could demand a stronger condition, namely that holds, with freely chosen . However, it can be shown by Discrete Fourier Transformation that this condition can be met only in very special cases, and when is prime and is almost mean-free, it is impossible to achieve. The argument is the following: Let be a circulant matrix where the generating vector is composed from the components , and otherwise zero. Then the condition is equivalent to . Let be the unit matrix and be a vector of zeros, then equivalently . So is also a circulant and we have . Taking DFTs, and is the diagonal (since is circulant) matrix of eigenvalues of .

The manifold $M_{8}$ is eight-dimensional and complex, and constructed as a two-sphere bundle over a six-dimensional (Kahler) base space $B_{6}$ . I want to think of this bundle as the total space of the anti-canonical line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ of $B_{6}$ , together with a point added at infinity in each $\mathbb{C}$ fibre to make them into spheres. In practice, from here , I believe this means I can think of $M_{8}$ as the total space of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{L})$ , where $\mathbb{P}$ indicates the projectivisation and $\mathcal{O}$ is the trivial line bundle over $B_{6}$ . I then want to compute the total Chern class of $M_{8}$ in terms of the data of $B_{6}$ . As a start, following this , I have that, taking $V=\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{L}$ and $\pi\colon\mathbb{P} V\to B_{6}$ , $$ c(T_{\mathcal{M}_{8}})=c(\pi^{*}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{L})\otimes\gamma^{*})c(\pi^{*}T_{B_{6}}), $$ where $\gamma$ is the tautological line bundle over $\mathbb{P} V=\mathcal{M}_{8}$ . Since $\mathcal{L}$ is the anti-canonical bundle of $B_{6}$ , I also know that $c_{1}(\mathcal{L})=c_{1}(T_{B_{6}})$ . The Whitney sum formula, etc., then gives \begin{align*} c(T_{\mathcal{M}_{8}}) & =c(\pi^{*}\mathcal{O}\otimes\gamma^{*})c(\pi^{*}\mathcal{L}\otimes\gamma^{*})c(\pi^{*}T_{B_{6}})\\  & =\left(1+\pi^{*}c_{1}(\mathcal{O})+c_{1}(\gamma^{*})\right)\left(1+\pi^{*}c_{1}(T_{B_{6}})+c_{1}(\gamma^{*})\right)\pi^{*}c(T_{B_{6}}), \end{align*} which I can expand out to read off the Chern classes. At this point, my geometry runs out. I have two questions: Naively, I'd say that $\gamma^{*}=\pi^{*}\mathcal{O}(1)$ and would then need to know $\mathcal{L}$ in terms of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ in order to make progress. Does that sound correct, or is that too quick? From this , it seems that it might be more complicated... In fact, the end goal is to compute the Pontryagin classes for $\mathcal{M}_{8}$ . In particular, is it obvious that $p_{1}^{2}$ and $p_{2}$ are always trivial, since $\mathcal{M}_{8}$ is constructed as a bundle? (Since everything reduces to classes $B_{6}$ , there are no non-trivial eight-form classes constructed from the Chern classes?) Thank you in advance, and sorry if I've said something imprecise.

55,Definition of a non-split root subgroup,Definition of a non-split root subgroup,,"I've been reading through Tits's Corvallis survey ""Reductive groups over a local field"" and something that surprised me that was taken for granted about the definition of root subgroups. Let $G$ be a reductive group over a local field $K$ with $K$ -split maximal torus $S$ . Given a relative root $\alpha \in \Phi(G,S)$ , we of course have a root subgroup $U_\alpha$ . However, none of the possible definitions of root subgroups I am aware of are adequate in general, in particular if both $\alpha$ and $2\alpha$ are relative roots. The thing that surprised me most initially is the implication that always $U_{2 \alpha} \subset U_\alpha$ , which is something I don't see how to justify in general. So the main question I'm asking is, how is $U_\alpha$ defined? To illustrate the issue, consider the simplest case possible: Let $G$ be the quasi-split form of $\mathrm{SU} _3$ for a quadratic, separable extension $L/K$ . Then $G$ consists of the $L$ -linear transformations of $L^3$ preserving the hermitian form $h(v_1, v_2, v_3) = v_1 \bar v_3 + v_2 \bar v_2 + v_3 \bar v_1$ , where $\bar v$ is the Galois conjugate of $v \in L$ . In terms of matrices, we have $g \in G$ if $g \in \mathrm{Res} _ {L/K} (\mathrm{SL} _3)$ and $g^\dagger J g = J$ where $g^\dagger$ is the transpose-Galois conjugate of $g$ and $$ J = \begin{bmatrix} 0&0&1\\ 0&1&0\\ 1&0&0 \end{bmatrix}. $$ One maximal $K$ -split torus $S$ consists of the matrices of the form $$ \begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1/a \end{bmatrix}, \qquad a \in K. $$ Then $\Phi(G, S)$ is of type $BC_1$ : there are $4$ relative roots of $(G, S)$ , and the two positive roots differ by a scalar multiple of $2$ . Denote the non-divisible positive root $\alpha$ the divisible one $2\alpha$ , where $B$ is taken as the upper triangular matrices in $G$ . In $\mathfrak g$ , the Lie algebra of $G$ , the root subalgebra $\mathfrak g_\alpha$ consists of matrices of the form $$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\bar c & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & c \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad c \in L, $$ and $\mathfrak g_{2\alpha}$ consists of matrices of the form $$ \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & d \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad d \in L \text{ such that } d + \bar d = 0. $$ There are 3 ways I'm aware of to define $U_\alpha$ : one using the exponentials of the Lie algebra, one using root homomorphisms, and one using the semisimple subgroup $G_\alpha$ given as the derived subgroup of a certain Levi (but this last one is certainly not correct for non-reduced root systems). From what I've seen, the exponential definition gets closest, but I'm still not happy with it. I would like to define $U_\alpha$ as $\exp{(\mathfrak g_\alpha)}$ in general for a relative root $\alpha$ . This would always lead to $U_\alpha \cap U_{2\alpha} = \{1\}$ , as $\mathfrak g_\alpha \cap \mathfrak g_{2\alpha} = 0$ . However, working through the example above, one can see that $\exp{(\mathfrak g_\alpha)}$ is not a subgroup of $\mathrm{SU} _3$ for the non-divisible $\alpha$ . So the next guess would be to define $U_\alpha$ as the subgroup of $G$ generated by $\exp{(\mathfrak g_\alpha)}$ . If this is the correct definition, why is it always true that $U_{2\alpha} \subset U_\alpha$ ? Although that's true in this case, it seems totally plausible that for a non-divisible root $\alpha$ , sometimes $\exp{(\mathfrak g_\alpha)}$ might be closed under group multiplication. It's also a bit unsatisfying because the exponential map is not defined in general in positive characteristic, and in particular if $\mathrm{char}(K) = 2$ , then it's not defined for $\mathfrak g_{\alpha}$ above. The next definition involves root homomorophisms. If one can find a define an injective homomorphism $u_\alpha: \mathbb G_a^n \to G$ such that $t u_\alpha(x) t^{-1} = u_\alpha(\alpha(t)\cdot x)$ for all $t \in S$ and $x \in \mathbb G_a^n$ , then the image of $u_\alpha$ would seem to be a pretty good candidate for $U_\alpha$ . However, in $\mathrm{SU} _3$ , this is not possible for the non-divisible root $\alpha$ . I think in general there's a scheme map from the additive group on $\mathfrak g_\alpha$ to $G$ that coincides with the exponential (or the closest thing possible given $K$ ), but since $\exp{(\mathfrak g_\alpha)}$ isn't necessarily a subgroup, this map is not a homomorphism. The root homomorphism Tits uses for $\mathrm{SU} _3$ is $$ u_1(c, d) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\bar c & d \\ 0 & 1 & c \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad c, d \in L \text{ such that } c\bar c + d + \bar d = 0, $$ which has the property that $t u_1(c, d) t^{-1} = u_1(\alpha(t) \cdot c, 2\alpha(t) \cdot d)$ . This is clearly almost as good as the property I defined above and is consistent with $U_{2\alpha} \subset U_\alpha$ . However, it seems to take this subset property for granted, and doesn't seem ideal for a definition of a root homomorphism for a non-divisible root—it seems more like a consequence of a different definition like exponentiation. So what is the correct definition? Should I start with a root homomorphism or the Lie algebra, and either way, how can I make sure my definition always works?","I've been reading through Tits's Corvallis survey ""Reductive groups over a local field"" and something that surprised me that was taken for granted about the definition of root subgroups.

(I've studied some scheme theory and homological algebra before, including derived categories, and also ventured a little bit more deeply in the categorical world, but never dealt professionally with these topics and will have to recall a lot before being sufficiently at ease with them.) In this context, what I'm looking for is a double list of topics, one from algebraic geometry and the other from category theory, both ordered by degrees of complexity, designed to be studied in a parallel manner, showing the highest possible level of correspondence since the very beginning, and if possible accompanied with the most up-to-date literature available for this purpose. I'd be very grateful if someone would spend some time thinking about this and writing a nice answer.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'homological-algebra', 'schemes', 'higher-category-theory', 'derived-categories']"
68,Why are Jacobian varieties important?,Why are Jacobian varieties important?,,"I've recently met Jacobian varieties, in the context of elliptic curves and modular curves. I'm still very new to them and not super comfortable with the machinery, so please forgive me any mistakes here. One convenient thing to do is to let $\varphi: X_0(N) \to E$ be a modular parameterization. Then letting $J(\cdot)$ stand for taking the Jacobian, $\varphi$ ought to transfer to a map $\varphi_*: J(X_0(N)) \to J(E)$ which is both a morphism of varieties and a group homomorphism, right? The group structure of the Jacobian lets you do things that aren't really possible to do directly with $\varphi$ on $X_0(N)$ and since $E \cong J(E)$ by $P \mapsto [P-O]$ , it's easy to move from $J(E)$ to $E$ itself. One question is about what this induced map ought to look like. Given $D = \sum a_i P_i$ a degree- $0$ divisor, is $\varphi_* D = \sum a_i \varphi(P_i)$ (which is again degree $0$ )? (And you have to check this makes sense when modding out the principal divisors.) I'm a bit unsure of what's going on because don't you usually induce maps on divisors going the other way? Furthermore, in the case of $\varphi:X_0(N) \to E$ , what's the relationship between ""summing up points in divisors"" and ""summing up points according to the group law on $E$ ""? I do know there is a lemma (from Silverman's Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves) that says a divisor on $E$ is principal if and only if it is degree $0$ and the points in it sum to $O$ under $E$ 's group law. One other fact I know is that in the case of curves over $\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. Riemann surfaces), there is a very concrete description of the Jacobian, as periods modulo homology, giving a $g$ -dimensional torus. Most of my exposure to Jacobians is through Diamond and Shurman's ""A First Course in Modular Forms."" I apologize for a question that's a bit all over the place, but what's the ""main thing"" I should take away from Jacobian varieties?

I guess this question leads into the more general question of ""how do incidence varieties work?"" For context, this is the statement of Bertini's theorem in Vakil (Theorem 13.4.2, December 31, 2022 Draft): Suppose $X$ is a smooth subvariety of $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ of (pure) dimension $d$ . Then there is a nonempty (= dense) open subset of dual projective space ${\mathbb{P}_k^n}^\vee$ such that for every point $p = [H] \in U$ , $H$ doesn't contain any component of $X$ , and the scheme $H \cap X$ is smooth over $\kappa(p)$ of (pure) dimension $d - 1$ . (1) What is $H \cap X$ for a point $p = [H] \in {\mathbb{P}_k^n}^\vee$ , and why is it a scheme over $\kappa(p)$ (in particular, how do we make sense of this if $k$ is not algebraically closed and $p$ is not a closed point)? How do we make rigorous (in a scheme-theoretic sense) the notion of "" $H$ containing a component of $X$ ? The best I could do in interpreting this is the follows: Let $I \subseteq X \times {\mathbb{P}_k^n}^\vee$ be the ""incidence variety"" (introduced in a paragraph above the statement of the theorem) cut out by the equation $a_0x_0 + \cdots + a_nx_n = 0$ , where $x_0, \ldots, x_n$ are homogeneous coordinates for $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ and $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ are homogeneous coordinates for ${\mathbb{P}_k^n}^\vee$ . Let $p = [H] \in {\mathbb{P}_k^n}^\vee$ , and take the fiber of $p$ in $I$ , then project it down to $X$ . But this is merely a set-theoretic description and fails to give it a scheme structure; furthermore, even if I used the scheme-theoretic closure, it fails to interpret it as a scheme over $\kappa(p)$ .

Bertini's Theorem. If $X$ is any quasi-projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$ , $f: X \to \mathbb{P}^n$ a regular map, $H \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ a general hyperplane, and $Y = f^{-1}(H)$ , then $$Y_{\text{sing}}= X_{\text{sing}} \cap Y. $$ where $X_{\text{sing}}=X- X_{\text{sm}}$ is the singular locus. The essence of the proof is to analyze the incidence correspondence $$ \Gamma = \{(p,H) \ \vert f(p) \in H \} \subset X \times (\mathbb{P}^n)^*  $$ If $X$ is $k$ -dimensional, $\Gamma$ will have dimension $k + n - 1$ . Now, let $p \in X$ be any smooth point and $H \subset \mathbb{P}^n$ a hyperplane containing $f(p)$ ; then it's easy to see that $$  \dim(T_{(p,H)}(\Gamma))= \dim(T_{(p,H)}(X \times (\mathbb{P}^n)^*))-1  $$ in particular, the singular locus of $\Gamma$ is exactly the inverse image $\pi_1(X_{\text{sing}}$ of the singular locus of $X$ under $\pi_1: X \times (\mathbb{P}^n)^* \to X$ . Now look at the restricted map $\tilde{\pi}_2 : \Gamma_{\text{sm}} \to (\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ . Bertini's theorem follows from applying Proposition 14.4 to $\tilde{\pi}_2$ ; or, more directly, by Exercise 14.6 the locus $U \subset (\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ of hyperplanes $H$ such that the fiber $\tilde{\pi}^{-1}_2(H) = X_{\text{sm}} \cap H$ is smooth is either contained in a proper subvariety of $(\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ or contains an open subset of $(\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ , and we can simply apply Sard's theorem to $\tilde{\pi}_2$ deduce that the former must be the case. Question: I would like to understand better the last part of the proof. Harris offers in the last sentence alongside to the crystal clear argument applying Proposition 14.4 another ""more directly"" argument by means of Exercise 14.6 which I not understand. This exercise asserts: Exercise 14.6. Let $f: X \to Y$ be any regular map of affine varieties. Then the dimension of the kernel of the differential $df_p: T_pX \to T_{f(p)}Y$ is an upper-semicontinuous function of $p$ . In other words $$X_{\ge k} :=\{p \in X \ \vert \ \dim \text{ Ker} (df_p)) \ge k\} \subset X$$ is closed for every $k \ge 0$ . This implies also that every subset $X_k:= \{p \in X \ \vert \ \dim \text{ Ker} (df_p) = k\}$ is locally closed or constructible and therefore $f(X_k)$ is constructible too, since images of constructible sets are constructible. Note that this statement does not imply that the locus of smooth points of fibers of $f$ - that is, the locus of $p \in X$ such that the fiber $X_{f(p)} = f^{-1} (f(p))$ is smooth at $p$ - is open or constructible in $X$ , or that the dimension of $T_p(X_{f(p)})$ is an upper-semicontinuous function of $p$ , since the Zariski tangent space to $X_{f(p)}$ may be smaller than $\text{Ker}(df_p)$ . And that's exactly the central problem. We know that the subsets $(\Gamma_{\text{sm}})_k$ and therefore their images under $\tilde{\pi}_2$ are locally closed / constructible. This implies that these have this mentioned property that they are either contained in a proper subvariety of $(\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ or contain an open subset . But we know by means of this exercise 14.6 not enough about the set $U \subset (\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ of those hyperplanes $H$ whose fibers $\tilde{\pi}^{-1}_2(H) \cong X_{\text{sm}} \cap H$ are smooth, ie those $H$ such that for every $(p, H) \in \Gamma_{\text{sm}}$ (equivalently $p \in H \cap X_{\text{sm}}$ ) the dimension of the tangent space of $\tilde{\pi}^{-1}_2(H)$ at $(p,H)$ equals $\dim H \cap X_{\text{sm}} =k-1$ . We only know that on the domain side there is an inclusion $$  \{(p,H) \in \Gamma_{\text{sm}} \ \vert \ \dim \text{Ker} (T_{(p,H)} \tilde{\pi}_2)= k-1\} \subset \{(p,H) \ \vert \ \tilde{\pi}^{-1}_2(H) \text{ smooth at } (p,H) \}$$ because obviously $T_{(p,H)}\tilde{\pi}^{-1}_2(H) \subset \text{Ker} (T_{(p,H)} \tilde{\pi}_2)$ . Therefore we conclude that the set on the right hand side is dense in $\Gamma_{\text{sm}}$ , because $(\Gamma_{\text{sm}})_{k-1}$ is open in $\Gamma_{\text{sm}}$ . But clearly it could happen that $\tilde{\pi}_2((\Gamma_{\text{sm}})_{\ge k})= (\mathbb{P}^n)^*$ , and so we would lose any control at the codomain side.

81,Do these two definitions of ring of regular functions coincide?,Do these two definitions of ring of regular functions coincide?,,"I'm following Gathmann's notes (from 2021) and I got to the section on regular functions (on affine varieties). He gives the following definition, which I believe is pretty standard: Definition 1. Let $X$ be an affine variety (not necessarily irreducible), and let $U$ be an open subset of $X$ . A regular function on $U$ is a map $\varphi\colon U \to K$ with the following property: for every $a\in U$ there are polynomial functions $f,g\in k[X]$ with $f(x)\neq 0$ and $\varphi(x) = \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}$ for all $x$ in an open subset $U_a$ with $a\in U_a\subseteq U$ . The set of all regular function on $U$ will be denoted $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ . However, I don't find this definition very intuitive, specially when compared to other texts. For instance, an older version of the notes (from 2002), or Mukai's book, give an alternative one, which I think is more natural: Definition 2. Let $X$ be an irreducible affine variety. As its coordinate ring is an integral domain, it has a well defined field of fractions, called the set of rational functions on $X$ , which we denote as $k(X) := \mathrm{Quot}(k[X])$ . Given a point $P\in X$ , the set of rational functions on $X$ defined at $P$ is $$\mathcal{O}_{X,P} := \left\{\frac{f}{g}\in k(X)\colon g(P) \neq 0 \right\}.$$ Given an open set $U\subseteq X$ , the set of rational functions of $X$ defined on $U$ is the set $$\mathcal{O}_X(U) := \bigcap_{P\in U} \mathcal{O}_{X,P}$$ .

The thing is I'm failing to catch the local aspect of the second definition: Q2. How is the second definition local? In particular, I'm struggling to understand the meaning of this example: Example.

90,Motivating Zariski topology,Motivating Zariski topology,,"I always find it difficult to motivate Zariski topology on $\text{Spec}(k[X_1,...,X_n])$ , both the underlying set and the topology. As far as I understand, Zariski topology isn't really that essential for proving many classical theorems like Bezout's (for example Fischer doesn't mention Zariski topology once in his Plane Algebraic Curves ); applications of Zariski topology where it does play an essential role are probably too advanced for me (although counterexamples are much appreciated). Then I wonder if I can at least motivate Zariski topology intrinsically. I can somehow agree with the naturalness of Zariski topology on $k^n$ : points should be closed and polynomials should be continuous; this is a bit like weak topology in functional analysis. But why do we want to consider prime ideals, i.e., to put points and irreducible varieties on the same footing? A usual answer is that preimage of maximal ideal is in general not maximal, but it is maximal in the case of finitely generated $k$ -algebras, which seems good enough (and why is it so important to take preimage?). Also, why should we think of the zero ideal as the ""generic point""? For me it's hard to relate that to those classical generic point arguments. But now I think I finally found a way to motivate Zariski topology. Please help me check if the math is correct. Let $K\supseteq k$ be a larger algrabraically closed field of infinite transcendence degree, e.g., if $k=Q^{\text{alg}}$ then we may take $K=\mathbb{C}$ . For each $a=(a_1,...,a_n)\in K^n$ , define $\pi(a)=\{f\in k[X_1,...,X_n]: f(a)=0\}$ . This is a prime ideal. We claim that $\pi:K^n\rightarrow\text{Spec}(k[X_1,...,X_n])$ is surjective. For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ , the image of $X_1,...,X_n$ in $k[X_1,...,X_n]/\mathfrak{p}$ is a tuple that satisfies exactly those polynomials in $\mathfrak{p}$ . The algebraic closure of $k[X_1,...,X_n]/\mathfrak{p}$ has transcendence degree at most $n$ over $k$ , and hence embeds into $K$ . We claim that with both $K^n$ and $\text{Spec}(k[X_1,...,X_n])$ endowed with Zariski topology, $\pi$ is a closed map, hence a quotient map. If $f(a)=0$ then $\pi(a)\ni f$ ; conversely if $\mathfrak{p}\ni f$ , choose any $a$ that maps to $\mathfrak{p}$ , and we must have $f(a)=0$ . This shows the image of a basic closed set in $K^n$ is a basic closed set in $\text{Spec}(k[X_1,...,X_n])$ ; the general case is similar. So the Zariski topology on $\text{Spec}(k[X_1,...,X_n])$ is just the quotient of the (in my opinion) more intuitive topology on $K^n$ . As for generic point, if $\pi(a)=\mathfrak{p}$ then the tuple $a$ satisfies those polynomials in $\mathfrak{p}$ and nothing else, as with ""most"" $K$ -points on the variety determined by $\mathfrak{p}$ ; in particular $\pi(a)=(0)$ iff $a=(a_1,...,a_n)$ are algebraically independent. This makes more sense to me than "" $(0)$ is a point that lies everywhere"". As for the reason of going to a larger field $K$ : truly generic point doesn't exist if we only look at $k$ . All algebraically closed fields (of a fixed characteristic) are more or less the same, so the structure of varieties don't really change when we move to a larger field.

This map is useful because if $k$ is algebraically closed and its characteristic is zero, the Killing form is non degenerate iff $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple. On the other hand, given a field extension of finite degree $K/k$ , one defines the trace map $K \rightarrow k$ which sends $x\in K$ to $tr(r_x)$ , where $r_x \in End_k(K)$ is the multiplication by $x$ .

99,Is the natural map composited by direct image functor and inverse image functor a natural isomorphism?,Is the natural map composited by direct image functor and inverse image functor a natural isomorphism?,,"Assume $\pi: \mathrm{X}\to \mathrm{Y}$ is a continuous map of topological space, then for sheaves respectively on them, the direct image functor is defined as: $\pi_*\mathscr{F}(\mathrm{V})=\mathscr{F}(\pi^{-1}(\mathrm{V}))$ for $\mathrm{V}\subset\mathrm{Y}$ ; The inverse image functor is defined as: $\pi^{-1}\mathscr{G}(\mathrm{U})=(\underrightarrow{\lim}_{\mathrm{V}\supset\pi(\mathrm{U})}\mathscr{G}(\mathrm{V}))^{\mathrm{sh}}$ for $\mathrm{U}\subset\mathrm{X}$ . The two functors are adjoint ( $\pi^{-1}$ is left-adjoint, $\pi_*$ is right-adjoint). Now question is: whether the unit $\epsilon: \pi^{-1}\pi_*\to\mathrm{id}$ is natural isomorphism or not? The question comes from the book The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, page 92 and page 136. Page 92: Note that we then get canonical maps $\pi^{-1}\pi_*\mathscr{F}\to\mathscr{F}$ (associated to the identity in $\mathrm{Mor_Y}(\pi_*\mathscr{F},\pi_*\mathscr{F})$ ) and $\mathscr{G}\to\pi_*\pi^{-1}\mathscr{G}$ (associated to the identity in $\mathrm{Mor_X}(\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F},\pi^{-1}\mathscr{F})$ ). I didn't know what this means, so I skipped. But later I met the other sentence (Page 136): ...more precisely, is an isomorphism $\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{Y}\to \pi_*\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}$ of sheaves on $\mathrm{Y}$ , or equivalently by adjointness, $ \pi^{-1}\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{Y}\to\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}$ of sheaves on $\mathrm{X}$ . Why here says ""equivalently""? Is the latter map the composition $\pi^{-1}\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{Y}\to\pi^{-1}\pi_*\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}\to\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}$ of sheaves on $\mathrm{X}$ ? If the former is an isomorphism is equivalent to the latter is, whether this means that $\pi^{-1}\pi_*\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}\to\mathscr{O}_\mathrm{X}$ is an isomorphism? Associated with the sentence I didn't understand on page 92 showed above, then I come up with the question (I guess maybe that sentence can help, so I show it here). If the answer is not, then what the author really means here? Thank you for helping me! Through the example given by the first comment, I thought of a further question, which is also more closer to the context of the book: If the map $\pi$ is a homeomorphism, then whether the unit $\epsilon: \pi^{-1}\pi_*\to\mathrm{id}$ is natural isomorphism or not? The last question's answer is Yes, as the second comment said. Now my doubts about this are all solved. Thanks again for helping me!","Assume is a continuous map of topological space, then for sheaves respectively on them, the direct image functor is defined as: for ; The inverse image functor is defined as: for .
