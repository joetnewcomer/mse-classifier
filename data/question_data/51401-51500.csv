1,Interchanging limit and integration when bounds of integration depend on a parameter,Interchanging limit and integration when bounds of integration depend on a parameter,,"This is yet another question on when it is permissible to interchange limits and integrals. I am interested in the situation when bounds of integration depend on some parameter, and then the limit is taken with respect to that parameter. Suppose one has a function $f(x,t)$ where $t$ is some parameter. Functions $a(t)$ and $b(t)$ give the bounds of integration. Let $a(t) \to a$ and $b(t) \to b$ as $t \to T$. I am interested in sufficient conditions that justify claiming that $$ \lim_{t \to T} \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(x, t) \, \mathrm{d}x= \int_a^b f(x,T) \, \mathrm{d} x. $$ Well-known versions of the recipes for interchanging limit and integral (Monotone Convergence and Dominated Convergence Theorems) seem to assume that the region of integration is constant, i.e. $a(t) = a$ and $b(t) = b$ for all $t$.","This is yet another question on when it is permissible to interchange limits and integrals.

I have a question about the derivation of the entropy inequality for the convex scalar conservation law $$ u_t+f(u)_x=0\tag{1} $$ which allows us to select unique weak solutions. I am sure that my question has been answered somewhere on stack exchange, but I haven't been able to express the mathematical verbiage that would allow me to find it. Background Let $\eta(u)$ be our ""entropy"" function which satisfies a conservation law of the form $$ \eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=0 $$ where $\psi(u)$ is some ""entropy flux"" function. Assume that both $\eta(u)$ and $\psi(u)$ are convex. Multiplying (1) by $\eta'(u)$ , we have $$ \eta'(u)u_t+\eta'(u)f'(u)u_x=0 $$ from which we infer $\psi'(u)=\eta'(u)f'(u)$ . Since we care about weak solutions admitting initial data with discontinuities in $u$ , we consider the viscous equation for (1) as $\epsilon \to 0$ . $$ u_t+f(u)_x=\epsilon u_{xx} $$ From which we can write $$ \eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=\epsilon\eta'(u)u_{xx} $$ Manipulating the right-hand side, we have $$ \eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x=\epsilon(\eta'(u)u_x)_x-\epsilon \eta''(u)u_x^2 $$ Now, consider a rectangle $[x_1,x_2] \times [t_1,t_2]$ where $u(x,t)$ has some discontinuity in the limiting solution as $\epsilon \to 0$ . $$ \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \eta(u)_t+\psi(u)_x dxdt = \epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} (\eta'(u)u_x)_x dxdt -\epsilon \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \eta''(u)u_x^2 dxdt $$ LeVeque writes As $\epsilon \to 0$ , the first term on the right hand side vanishes. (This is clearly true if $u$ is smooth at $x_1$ and $x_2$ , and can be shown more generally.) The other term, however, involves integrating $u_x^2$ over $[x_1,x_2] \times [t_1,t_2]$ .

60,Elliptic Integral along complex path,Elliptic Integral along complex path,,"I am interested in the following integral \begin{align} \int \frac{dt}{t\sqrt{(t-e_1)(t-e_2)(t-e_3)}} \end{align} where $e_1=\bar{e}_3$ and $e_2\in\mathbb{R}$ is negativ. Assume that the branch cut of the square root goes to minus infinity. Also assume that the real part of $e_1$ , and hence of $e_3$ , is greater than zero. I want to perform the integration along the straight vertical path from $e_1$ to $e_3$ and rewrite it in terms of elliptic integrals of first, second or third kind. A suitable reference is of course the book Handbook of elliptic functions by Byrd, Friedman and on page 89 they the consider this integral by integrating along the real line. For example, integrating  from $e_2$ to minus infinity the integral takes a particular easy form (see page 94, eq. 245.06 and page 216, eq. 361.60 with $f_1=0$ ). I feel like the form for integrating from $e_1$ to $e_3$ should be similar since we are still integrating between the branch points. Maybe someone can help me or post a reference for similar problems? Edit: The case I mentioned above is \begin{align}   \int_{-\infty}^{e_2}\frac{dt}{t\sqrt{(t-e_1)(t-e_2)(t-e_3)}}=c\int_{0}^{u_1}\frac{1-cnu}{1+\alpha\, cn u} \end{align} for some constants $c,\alpha$ depending on the $e_i$ and $cn u_1=-1$ . The right hand side can be simplified to \begin{align}   \frac{1}{\alpha}(-2K(m)+\frac{2}{1-\alpha}\Pi(\frac{\alpha^2}{\alpha^2-1},m)) \end{align} where $K$ and $\Pi$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and third kind, respectively. Edit2: I kind of found the solution by myself but this will probably not work in the general case because I have some additional information. Nevertheless, maybe the edit will help someone else. The following calculation should be right modulo signs. Assume that the imaginary part of $e_1$ is greater than zero (which is no restriction since we can just exchange $e_1$ and $e_3$ ). The additional information I have is that I know the imaginary part of the integral \begin{align*}   \int_{e_1}^{e_2}\frac{dt}{t\sqrt{(t-e_1)(t-e_2)(t-e_3)}}. \end{align*} Denote the imaginary part of this integral by $v$ . Since $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ is completely imaginary and $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}+\int_{e_3}^{\infty}+\int_{\infty}^{e_1}=0$ by the residue theorem we get $\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ . On the other hand $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}+\int_{e_2}^{e_3}+\int_{e_3}^{e_1}=2\pi i$ and hence $\int_{e_3}^{e_1}=2\pi i - 2 i v$ (as the imaginary part of $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}$ and $\int_{e_2}^{e_3}$ are the same). Therefore \begin{align*}   \textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\pi  - v. \end{align*} By holomorphicity $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}=\int_{e_1}^{-\infty}+\int_{-\infty}^{e_2}$ (above the branch cut). However, we also have $\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{-\infty}$ we and hence \begin{align*}    \textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=v-\textrm{Im}\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}. \end{align*} The integral $\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}$ is purely imaginary. Putting these equations together we can express the integral $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ in terms of some constants and the formula for $\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}$ in my first edit. Again, I did not take care of the signs in the integrations at all so be careful there. Remark: For the general case I tried to identify $\wp=x$ and then use the relations of Weierstrass elliptic functions for rhombic tori, i.e. $\wp(z)=e_2+H_2\frac{1+cn(z';m)}{1-cn(z';m)}$ (see Abramowitz/Stegun p. 649 for the notation).  We can integrate the Jacobi ellitpic functions (eq. 361.60 from Handbook of ellitpic functions ) and for the elliptic integral of the third kind I tried using the identities of the book Elliptic functions and applications, Lawden on page 76.

Let $f$ be a Borel measurable function which is Riemann integrable over every compact interval. Then $f$ is Lebesgue integrable over $\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^{n}|f(x)|dx $ exist in $\mathbb{R}$ . In this case $\int f =\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^{n}f(x)dx $ . Using this with $f(x)=e^{-x^2}$ and applying the change of variable rule from calculus I get $$\sqrt{\pi}=\int e^{-x^2} =\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^{n}e^{-x^2}dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-\sqrt{2}n}^{\sqrt{2}n}e^{-x^2/2}dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^{n}e^{-x^2/2}dx$$ which shows, by the previous proposition, that $\int e^{-x^2/2} $ exists and equals $\sqrt{2\pi}$ . The converse implication is similar. This reasoning made use of the fact that $e^{-x^2}$ is a non-negative function because in general the convergence of $\int_{-n}^{n}f(x)dx$ does not imply Lebesgue integrability. How shoud I proceed when $f$ can be both positive and negative? Can this approach still work? Here is an example: consider the Lebesgue integral $\int_{0}^{\infty} xe^{-x^2}=1/2$ . From symmetry it should be clear that the integral $\int_{-\infty}^{0} xe^{-x^2}$ exists and its value ought to be $-1/2$ . Indeed the proposition gives $$ \int_{0}^{\infty} xe^{-x^2}=\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{0}^{n} xe^{-x^2} dx=-\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{-n}^{0} xe^{-x^2}dx$$ which shows that $\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{-n}^{0} xe^{-x^2}dx$ exists and equals $-1/2$ . But the existence of this limit of Riemann integrals does not imply the existence of the Lebesgue integral $\int_{-\infty}^{0} xe^{-x^2}$ . Existence must be confirmed separately by checking that $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{-n}^{0} |x|e^{-x^2}dx=\lim_{n\to \infty} \int_{0}^{n} xe^{-x^2}dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} xe^{-x^2}=1/2$$ This example is trivial but for more complicated cases the problem is the same.","In my book it is shown how to compute the following Lebesgue integral: I want to show that this result is equivalent to Up to now we haven't proven any change of variable formula, but we have proven the following: Proposition.

My challenge is to strictly weighted-ly cover all the rational numbers between $A$ and $B$ with open intervals. By weighted-ly cover means each paticular rational number lies in a particular interval. However, each interval has a weight $a_i$ . The challenge here is that weighted sum must be less than $k'$ . Before we proceed let's return to normal measure theory where $a_i=1$ for all weights. Then we have $k' = \int_{A}^B dx= B-A$ . Now, let us look at limit of a sum as Riemann integral: $$ {\displaystyle \Delta x={\frac {B-A}{n}}}$$ $$  A + r \Delta x \to x$$ OR $$ r \to \frac{x -A}{\Delta x}$$ Note: $r$ is a dummy variable. Now, in the limit $\Delta x \to 0$ $$ \int_A^B f(x) dx = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\Delta x\left[f(a+\Delta x)+f(a+2\,\Delta x)+\cdots +f(b-\Delta x)\right]= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\sum_{r=1}^n f(a+ r \Delta x) \Delta x$$ So what will $k$ be in the case where all $a_i$ aren't the same? Let's put this question in light of the answer : Claim: If $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log^2(n)}{n}\sum_{r=1}^n |b_r| = 0$ and $f$ is smooth, then $$\lim_{k \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{r=1}^n a_rf\left(\frac{kr}{n}\right)\frac{k}{n} = \left(\lim_{s \to 1} \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\sum_{r=1}^\infty \frac{a_s}{r^s}\right)\int_0^\infty f(x)dx.$$ where $a_r = \sum_{e|r} b_e$ All we now do is add the notation: $$ \int_{A}^B a_{\frac{x-A}{dx} } f(x) dx= \lim_{k \to B-A} \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{r=1}^n a_rf\left(A+\frac{kr}{n}\right)\frac{k}{n}$$ In fact using the co-ordinate transformation $dy = f(x) dx$ with a function. We also define a coordinate transformation or mapping $ g(x) = y$ . Hence, $$  r \to \frac{x-A}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx}= f(x) \frac{x-A}{dy} = f(g^{-1} (y))  \Big( \frac{g^{-1} (y)- A}{dy} \Big) $$ This enables us to talk about coordinate transformations.

However, I think it's very nice, because it highlights the properties of logarithms, including the $x \to 1/x$ antisymmetry, and again, converges fast. Due to the fact that it's alternating, we can also use a better approximation with the truncated sum: $$\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2} \left(\frac{\log x}{x-1}+\frac{x+1}{2x} \right)  \approx \\ \approx  \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \frac{(-1)^n}{1-4 n^2} \binom{2n}{n} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^n}{2^{4n}}+\frac{(-1)^N}{2(1-4 N^2)} \binom{2N}{N} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^N}{2^{4N}}$$ What's really interesting (to me at least) is how I obtained this series. I didn't even think about hyperbolic functions. I started with a Frullani integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{t} \left(\frac{1}{1+t}-\frac{1}{1+xt} \right)= \log x$$ Then I used the inverse function identity: $$y= f(t)=\frac{1}{t} \left(\frac{1}{1+t}-\frac{1}{1+xt} \right)$$ $$\log x= \int_{y(\infty)}^{y(0)} f^{-1} (y) dy$$ We can get the inverse function explicitly: $$y t (1+t) (1+x t)=(x-1) t$$ $$t^2+\frac{x+1}{x} t+\frac{y-x+1}{x y}=0$$ Solving this simple quadratic and taking the positive root, we obtain: $$t(y)=\frac{1}{2x} \left( \sqrt{\frac{x-1}{y}} \sqrt{(x-1) y+4x}-(x+1) \right)$$ $$\log x= \int_0^{x-1} t(y) dy$$ Substituting: $$y=(x-1) z^2$$ We have: $$t(z)=\frac{1}{2x} \left( \frac{1}{z} \sqrt{(x-1)^2 z^2+4x}-(x+1) \right)$$ $$\log x=\frac{x-1}{x} \int_0^1 \left( \sqrt{(x-1)^2 z^2+4x}-(x+1)z \right) dz$$ Simple rearrangement and expanding the square root immediately leads to (1), including the condition for convergence. I wonder if other, even more interesting series for the logarithm can be obtained by this method, using the general integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{F(t)-F(x t)}{t} dt=(F(0)-F(\infty)) \log x$$ * Update, more information about convergence rate: If we denote: $$f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2} \left(\frac{\log x}{x-1}+\frac{x+1}{2x} \right)$$ $$S(x)=\sum_{n=0}^N \frac{(-1)^n}{1-4 n^2} \binom{2n}{n} \frac{\left(x+ \frac{1}{x}-2 \right)^n}{2^{4n}}$$ $$G(x)=\sqrt{x} \left(\frac{1}{x-1} \sum_{k=0}^N \frac{1}{2k+1}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)^{2k+1}+\frac{x+1}{4x} \right) $$ Then it's clear that for a very small number of terms $N \leq 10$ and for $x$ close to $1$ , $S(x)$ performs better than $G(x)$ , but for larger number of terms it's not as good. There's another series I found for the logarithm, but it has even slower convergence: $$\log x= \frac{x^2-1}{2x} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1) \binom{2n}{n}} \frac{(x-1)^{2n}}{x^n}$$","Have you seen this series referenced anywhere?
