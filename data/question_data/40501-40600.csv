More precisly. By $G_1$ and $G_2$ we denote two finite groups. Let $\mathbb{Z} ( G_1 )$ and $\mathbb{Z} ( G_2 )$ be group algebras.

Number of elements of  order $3$ in $S_5$ (they are actually in $A_5$) are $\frac{5.4.3}{3}=20$ Now, each element of order $3$ has to be in some sylow $3$ subgroup.As there are $20$ non identity elements of order $3$ and each sylow subgroup affords only $2$ non identity elements there should be $10$ sylow $3$ subgroups ($10\times 2=20$) So, now we have $n_5(A_5)=6,n_3(A_5)=10$ Suppose $n_2(A_5)=3$ we would have (assuming no two sylow subgroups intersect non trivially) $3\times 3=9$ non identity elements and adding up with above collection of non identity elements we would get $(3\times 3=9)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=53$ which is a contradiction as there are $59$ non identity elements in $A_5$ So, Possibilities are  $n_2(A_5)=5\text { or }15$ and there are two chances : there are $5$ sylow $2$ subgroups with no two sylow subgroup intersecting non trivially adds upto $5\times 3=15$ non identity elements and with above calculation we have $(5\times 3=15)+(10\times 2=20)+(6\times 4=24)=59$ so we do not have any problem with this. there are $15$ sylow $2$ subgroups  such that for any two  distinct sylow $2$ subgroups we have $|P_2\cap P_2'|=2$ then each sylow $2$ subgroup contribute only one non identity element which is not there in any other sylow $2$ subgroup adding upto $15\times 1=15$ non identity elements.

Now consider the subfield $K(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n)$ generated over $K$ by the elementary symmetric polynomials.

My doubt is about this isomorphism; I do see how we need edges in $T-G$ in order to generate loops based at a point, since $T$ is acyclic (so that if $G=T$, the group is trivial). But I do not see how the group is isomorphic to the free group generated by edges in $T-G$. This is what I have so far: let $f_i$ denote a free edge, i.e., an edge in $T-G$. We can assume there is just one path joining any two edges in $T$ (otherwise, $T$ would contain a cycle) Given $g$ fixed in $G$ (assume WOLG $g$ in $T$), I think every closed loop based at $g$ can be realized as the concatenation of a path within $T$, and an edge $f_i$ (aka, a path in $G-T$), and then a(the) path from an endpoint of $f_i$ to $g$ again. Then, for any edge $f_i$, there is a (class) of loops based at $g$. Question: is the above the sketch of a proof for the fact that $\Pi_1(G)$ is the free group generated by all the edges in $G-T$? Sorry, I did not know how to make the question any more concise; I hope I don't get any Courics for writing too-long of a question.

Find the minimal polynomial of $\alpha=\sqrt{2+\sqrt[3]{3}}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . My attempt First, I tried to find the polynomial with rational(integer) coefficients having $\alpha$ as a root, and $f(x)=x^6-6x^4+12x^2-11$ is a polynomial such that $f(\alpha)=0$ . Unfortunately, $6$ and $12$ is not divided by $11$ , so I could not use the Eisenstein's criterion. Instead of directly showing that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ , I tried to show that $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]=6$ . Since $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}]=[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)][\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2):\mathbb{Q}]$ and $\alpha^2=2+\sqrt[3]{3}$ , we know that $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2):\mathbb{Q}]=3$ . Thus if we succeed to show that $[\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}(\alpha^2)]=2$ , then the proof is over. However, I could not do it.

69,Algebraic Functors and Left Adjoints,Algebraic Functors and Left Adjoints,,"I'm currently taking a class on Categorical Logic, and we're just finishing our section on Lawvere Duality for algebraic theories. As a quick remark, our profesor mentioned that every algebraic functor admits a left adjoint, and gave an example which feels wrong to me. Definitions and the example are below: Recall a Lawvere Algebraic Theory $\mathbb{A}$ is a finite product category with objects $A^n$ for $n \in \omega$ . $A = A^1$ is called the generator or universal model of $\mathbb{A}$ . The category of (set-valued) $\mathbb{A}$ -models is $\mathsf{Mod}(\mathbb{A}) =  \mathsf{FP}(\mathbb{A}, \mathsf{Set})$ , the finite product preserving functors into Set. Then a (finite product) functor $F : \mathbb{A} \to \mathbb{B}$ induces a functor $F^* : \mathsf{Mod}(\mathbb{B}) \to \mathsf{Mod}(\mathbb{A})$ . That is, an $\mathbb{A}$ -model in the (syntax) category $\mathbb{B}$ induces a (semantic) map from $\mathbb{B}$ -models to $\mathbb{A}$ -models. Such a functor $F^*$ is called Algebraic . One can prove (though I have not seen the proof) that algebraic functors have left adjoints. As an example of this phenomenon, my professor said the following: If $\mathbb{G}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are the syntactic categories of groups and rings, respectively, then we have the map $F : \mathbb{G} \to \mathbb{R}$ which sends the generator to the generator. This map induces $F^* : \mathsf{Ring} \to \mathsf{Group}$ , the functor taking a ring to its underlying abelian group. He then remarked the guaranteed left adjoint $G : \mathsf{Group} \to \mathsf{Ring}$ is the group ring functor (I assume over $\mathbb{Z}$ ), however this doesn't sit well with me. The ""group ring"" functor is left adjoint to the ""group of units"" functor, but adjoints are unique and so something must be wrong. Perhaps there is some alternative notion of group ring that makes this go through? The questions, then, are: Am I correct in thinking that the group ring functor cannot be left adjoint to the underlying group functor? If so, then what is the guaranteed left adjoint? I cannot come up with a good candidate, and Google seems to be of little help in the matter. Are there references which will discuss these results?

99,Is every finite subgroup of $C^*=$ set of all non-zero complex numbers cyclic?,Is every finite subgroup of  set of all non-zero complex numbers cyclic?,C^*=,Is every finite subgroup  of $C^*=$ set of all non-zero complex numbers cyclic? I see that the set $A_n=\{z:z^n=1\}$ is a subgroup of $C^{*}$. Any element of $A_n$ is a solution of $z^n=1$.Now the solutions of $z^n=1$ for any $n\in \Bbb N$ are $e^{\frac{{2ki\pi}}{{n}}};1\le k\le n$ and hence the subgroup $A_n$ is generated by $a=e^{\frac{{2ki\pi}}{{n}}}$ and hence cyclic. But is it the case that any finite subgroup of $C^{*}$ is of the form $A_n$ for some $n$? I am having problems to answer this question.If it is true then it answers the original question.
