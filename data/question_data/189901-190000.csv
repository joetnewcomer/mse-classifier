0,How do properties of a function change as you move away from its derivatives?,How do properties of a function change as you move away from its derivatives?,,"I have the following question on how the properties of a function change as you move away from points where its derivative are 0. To give some context to my question, I will break it into 3 parts. Part 1: Suppose we take the Poisson Probability Distribution: \begin{equation} P(X=k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \end{equation} We can define the likelihood function as: \begin{equation} L(\lambda; x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i=k_i;\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda^{k_i} e^{-\lambda}}{k_i!} \end{equation} \begin{equation} l(\lambda; x) = \ln L(\lambda; x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [k_i \ln \lambda - \lambda - \ln (k_i!)] \end{equation} To find the MLE, we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $\lambda$ , set it to zero, and solve for $\lambda$ : \begin{equation} \frac{dl}{d\lambda} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [ \frac{k_i}{\lambda} - 1] = 0 \end{equation} \begin{equation} \hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i \end{equation} Part 2: After having derived the MLE of the Poisson Distribution, we can apply the ""useful"" properties of MLE theory to this MLE (e.g. https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/Bayes/likprinc_lect2.pdf ). This includes properties such as: Consistency : The sample value of the MLE estimator approaches the true value as the sample size approaches infinity Asymptotic Normality: The distribution of the MLE estimator approaches a Normal Distribution as the sample size approaches infinity Efficiency (via Cramer-Rao Lower Bound) : The variance of the MLE estimator is lowest possible variance out of all similar estimators Invariance: If $\hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}}$ is the MLE estimator of $\lambda$ , then $g(\hat{\lambda}_{\text{MLE}})$ is the MLE estimator of $g(\lambda)$ Part 3: In the above example ( Part 1 ), the MLE had a closed-form analytical solution. But in real world problems, the likelihood function can be multi-dimensional and the derivatives need to be numerically approximated. This means that there is always a risk that the numerically approximated solution to the MLE will not be the exact MLE. And the ""useful theoretical properties"" ( Part 2 ) might not fully apply to the numerically approximated solution. My Question: But to what extent do these theoretical properties apply to the numerically approximated MLE solution .... as the numerically approximated solution moves further away from the true MLE solution? Using the R programming language, I simulated 100 points from a Poisson Distribution with $\lambda$ = 5. I then calculated the log-likelihood function and the MLE estimated for $\lambda$ based on these 100 simulated points. I then plotted the log-likelihood function alongside the true MLE solution (i.e. $\lambda = 5$ ) , the MLE estimate and two random candidate solutions: # Set seed for reproducibility set.seed(123)  # Simulate 100 points from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 5 data <- rpois(100, 5)  # Estimate lambda using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) lambda_mle <- mean(data)  # Define the log-likelihood function log_likelihood <- function(lambda) {     sum(dpois(data, lambda, log = TRUE)) }  # Create a sequence of lambda values lambda_values <- seq(5, 5.5, by = 0.01)  # Calculate the log-likelihood for each lambda value (plotting code has been omitted for brevity, I can post this as well if necessary) log_likelihood_values <- sapply(lambda_values, log_likelihood) In the above graph, since Candidate Solution #1 is closer to the true MLE solution compared to Candidate Solution #2 -  would the theoretical properties of MLE be more applicable to Candidate Solution #1 compared to Candidate Solution #2 ? And how much more applicable? In the above graph it might be obvious, but I am not sure how this concept generalizes to higher dimensional problems. Is there some mathematical proof which can show that certain theoretical properties known at the true solution .... are more applicable to candidate (numerical) solutions that are closer to the true solution compared to candidate solutions that are further away from the true solution? Thanks! Note: I am wondering if there some mathematical framework here, e.g. draw a ball of radius ""r"" around the likelihood function at its true MLE solution. Perhaps, there might be some mathematical proof that shows ALL solutions located exactly ""r"" units away from the true solution are just as good (so long as they are valid solutions, e.g. certain MLE parameters have constraints, e.g. variance estimates are non-negative)? Using the same logic, if $r_1$ > $r_2$ , then .... the set of all solutions located exactly $r_2$ units away from the true MLE are ""better"" than the set of all solutions located exactly $r_1$ units away from the true MLE?","I have the following question on how the properties of a function change as you move away from points where its derivative are 0.

4,"If $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$ are injections, then there's a bijection $h:A\to B$.","If  and  are injections, then there's a bijection .",f:A\to B g:B\to A h:A\to B,"Is this proof valid? I'm pretty sure the idea is correct but not sure if ive written it correctly. Theorem. If $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow A$ are injections, then there's a bijection $h:A\rightarrow B$ . Proof. So we have injections $f:A\rightarrow B$ and $g:B\rightarrow A$ . Assume that $B\setminus \text{ran}(f)$ is not empty, i.e. $f$ is not surjective. For any $\displaystyle b\notin ran( f)$ , let its sequence of distinct $\displaystyle a$ 's be defined by: $$a_{1} =g(b)$$ $$a_{n+1} =g( f( a_{n}))$$ To see why they are distinct, consider $\displaystyle a_{i}$ and $\displaystyle a_{j}$ for $\displaystyle i< j$ . Then since $\displaystyle f$ and $\displaystyle g$ are injective, the equality $\displaystyle a_{i} =a_{j}$ can be reduced to $\displaystyle b=g( f( a_{j-i}))$ , which is not possible since $\displaystyle b\notin ran( f)$ . As an example, consider $\displaystyle a_{3} =g( f( g( f( g( f( b))))))$ and $\displaystyle a_{5} =g( f( g( f( g( f( g( f( g( f( b))))))))))$ . Then $\displaystyle a_{3} =a_{5}$ is same as saying $\displaystyle b=g( f( g( f( b))))$ . Each $a \in A$ is either in exactly one sequence or in none of them. Define $h:A\rightarrow B$ by $$ h(a) =  \begin{cases}  g^{-1}(a) & \text{if $a$ in some sequence} \\ f(a) & \text{else} \end{cases} $$ To prove that $h$ is injective, we prove that we can't have $h(a_1) = h(a_2)$ with $h(a_1) = g^{-1}(a_1)$ and $h(a_2) = f(a_2)$ . Let $g^{-1}(a_1) = b_1$ . Now $a_1$ is an element of a sequence, so either $b_1 \notin \text{ran}(f)$ or $b_1 \in \text{ran}(f)$ . Case 1. $b_1 \notin \text{ran}(f)$ Then $b_1$ i.e. $g^{-1}(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ . Case 2. $b_1 \in \text{ran}(f)$ Then $f^{-1}(b_1) = a'_{1}$ . Now $a'_{1} \neq a_{2}$ , since $a'_{1}$ is in a sequence but $a_{2}$ is not. That implies $f(a'_{1}) \neq f(a_{2})$ , which means $b_1$ i.e. $g^{-1}(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$ . To see that $h$ is surjective, take $b \in B$ and let $a = g(b)$ . If $a$ is in a sequence, then $h(a) = g^{-1}(a) = b$ . Otherwise $a$ is not in a sequence, so it must be that $b \in \text{ran}(f)$ . Then $f^{-1}(b) = a'$ is not in a sequence either, so $h(a') = f(a') = b$ .","Is this proof valid?

The set ${\mathbb P}[0,1]$ can be made into a complete metric space by defining the distance function $d,$ where $d(E,F) = {\lambda^{*} (E \Delta F)}.$ the graph of $f$ is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ using the Lebesgue measure, the expected value of $f$ is computable Simplified Version of the Main Question: In the main question , a non-perfect dense set in the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ is “topologically large” in the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ , where the main question translates to the following: Does there exist a explicit, bijective and measurable function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ such that: the graph of $f$ is dense in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ the range of $f$ is $[0,1]$ the pre-image of most subsets of the range of $f$ under $f$ are measurable in the sense of Caratheodory the graph of $f$ is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ using the uniform probability measure , the expected value of $f$ is computable? Motivation: I wanted to define an explicit and bijective function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ where the graph of $f$ is somewhat but not too evenly distributed (i.e. with complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ , such that using the uniform probability measure , we want a subset $X\subseteq[0,1]$ , where (when function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ is restricted to $f:X\to[0,1]$ ) the expected value of $f$ is undefined so we can find an unique extension of the expected value of $f$ which gives a finite value instead . Question on motivation: If the function from the main question exists, does it satisfy the motivation? Attempt to Solve Both Questions: I can't prove an explicit example exists but here is my attempt from this and this question ( note in both links, neither answers gave what I wanted, e.g. in this answer , the function wasn't very explicit and in this answer , the function was extremely “non-uniform”): In case one wants to read here, here's the attempt: Suppose the base- $3$ expansion of real numbers, in interval $[0,1]$ , have infinite decimals that approach $x\in[0,1]$ from the right side so when $0\le x_1,x_2\le 1$ (and $x_1=x_2$ ) we get $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ . Furthermore, for $\mathbb{N}\cup\left\{0\right\}=\mathbb{N}_{0}$ , if $r\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and $\text{digit}_{3}:\mathbb{R}\times  \mathbb{Z}\to\left\{0,1,2\right\}$ is a function where $\text{digit}_{3}(x,r)$ takes the digit in the $3^{r}$ -th decimal fraction of the base- $3$ expansion of $x$ (e.g. $\text{digit}_{3}(1.789,2)=\text{digit}_{3}({1.210022{\cdot\cdot\cdot}}_{3},2)=1$ ), then $\left\{{g_r}^{\prime}\right\}_{r\in\mathbb{N}_{0}}$ is a sequence of functions (and $\left[\cdot\right]$ is the nearest integer function) such that ${g_r}^{\prime}:\mathbb{N}_0\to\mathbb{N}_0$ is defined to be: \begin{equation}   g_r^{\prime}(x)=\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin(rx)+\frac{10}{3}\right]  \end{equation} then for some function $k:\mathbb{N}_{0}\to\mathbb{N}_{0}$ , where $k$ is strictly increasing and $k(0)$ is a positive number, we want the the intermediate function (before $f$ ) or $f_{1}:[0,1]\to[0,10]$ to satisfy the main question (such that, in criteria 3. the range of $f_1$ is $[0,10]$ ). \begin{alignat}{2} & f_{1}(x)  =  &&\left|\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty} g_{r+1}^{\prime}\!\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\!\!\bigg/3^{r}\right)-10\right|=  \label{eq:025} \\ & && \left|\left(\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin\left(\left(r+1\right)\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\right)+\frac{10}{3}\right]\right)\!\!\bigg  /3^{r}\right)-10\right| \nonumber \end{alignat} (One example of $k(r)$ that may satisfy main question, when with criteria 3. the range of $f_1$ is $[0,10]$ instead of $[0,1]$ , is $k(r)=10r+20$ ) What we’re doing with $f_1$ is we are converting every digit of the base- $3$ expansion of $x$ into a pseudo-random number that is non-equally likely to be an integer, including and in-between, $0$ and $20/3$ . Furthermore, we attempt to make the function dense in $[0,1]\times[0,10]$ by adding the $3^{r}$ -th decimal fraction with the next $3^k$ -th decimal fractions; however, we also want to control the end-points of $[0,10]$ , such that $f_1$ is dense in $\left[0,1\right]\times\left[0,1\right]$ by manipulating $f_1$ to get: \begin{alignat}{2} & f(x)  = && 1-\frac{1}{10}f_1(x)\label{eq:109}\\  & &&   1-\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)\left|\left(\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin\left(\left(r+1\right)\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\right)+\frac{10}{3}\right]\right)\!\!\bigg/3^{r}\right)-10\right|  \nonumber \end{alignat} (e.g. where $k(r)=10r+20$ ).

A function $f\in G(\mathbb R^0)$ is trivial: $f()=0$ . A function $f\in G(\mathbb R^1)$ is $f(x)=\tfrac12f(1)(|x|+x)+\tfrac12f(-1)(|x|-x)$ . Hence $f\in F_1(\mathbb R^1)$ . A function $f\in G(\mathbb R^2)$ is sharp (i.e. non-differentiable) along some rays meeting at $(0,0)$ , and is smooth on the sectors between those rays. If all sectors are half-planes or larger, then $f\in F_1(\mathbb R^2)$ . If any sector is less than a half-plane, then there's some function $g\in F_2(\mathbb R^2)$ with three sharp rays that agrees with $f$ around the two sharp rays bounding that sector, so that $f-g$ has one less sharp ray than $f$ ; the original two rays are cancelled and a third ray is added. (The prototypical functions for this are $g(x,y)=\max(|x|,y)=\tfrac12(|x|+y+\big||x|-y\big|)$ and $g(x,y)=\min(|x|,y)=\tfrac12(|x|+y-\big||x|-y\big|)$ ; apply linear transformations to these.) Inducting on the number of sharp rays, we find $f=\sum g\in F_2(\mathbb R^2)$ . We also have $|x|=\max(x,-x)$ , and $-\max(x,y)=\min(-x,-y)$ , so anything in $F_k$ can be expressed in terms of $\max$ and $\min$ . Furthermore, addition distributes over $\max$ and $\min$ , and $\max$ and $\min$ distribute over each other: $$x+\max(y,z)=\max(x+y,x+z)$$ $$\max(x,\min(y,z))=\min(\max(x,y),\max(x,z))$$ It follows that anything in $F_k$ can be expressed in the form $$\min(\max(f_{11},f_{12},\cdots),\max(f_{21},f_{22},\cdots),\max(f_{31},f_{32},\cdots),\cdots)$$ for some linear functions $f_{ij}\in F_0$ . If we can find some universal bound $k$ on the nesting depth of $\max$ , i.e. if $\max\in F_k(\mathbb R^n)$ for all $n$ , then the same bound applies to $\min$ , and any function has a nesting depth at most $2k$ .","Construct a sequence of function spaces as follows: is the space of linear forms . is the span of functions in and their absolute values.

68,Munkres Lemma 2.1,Munkres Lemma 2.1,,"I'm trying to make sure that I have correctly proved Munkres' Lemma 2.1, which is left to the reader. The lemma states: Let $f: A \to B$ . If there are functions $g: B \to A$ and $h: B \to A$ such that $g(f(a)) = a$ for every $a$ in $A$ and $f(h(b)) = b$ for every $b$ in $B$ , then $f$ is bijective and $g = h = f^{-1}$ . Here is my attempted proof. We will show that $f$ is bijective by showing that it is both surjective and injective. Fix $b \in B$ . Then $h(b) = a$ for some $a \in A$ . Applying $f$ , we obtain $f(a) = f(h(b)) = b$ , so $f$ is surjective. Now, suppose $f(a) = f(a')$ for some $a,a' \in A$ . Applying $g$ , we obtain $g(f(a)) = g(f(a'))$ and hence $a = a'$ , so $f$ is injective and hence bijective. Now, it suffices to demonstrate that $g = h$ . We have $$g \circ \mathrm{id}_B = g \circ (f \circ h) = (g \circ f) \circ h = \mathrm{id}_A \circ h = h.$$ Therefore, we have $f \circ g =  f \circ h = \mathrm{id}_B$ and $g \circ f = h \circ f = \mathrm{id}_B$ , so $g = h = f^{-1}$ , as required. The thing I'm most concerned about is whether I've shown that $g = h = f^{-1}$ . This requires showing two things, I believe: (1) that $g$ and $h$ are equal and (2) that they both operate as both left and right inverses. By showing that $g$ is also a right inverse, I've shown it is a two-sided inverse, and similarly by showing that $h$ is also a left inverse. I haven't shown that any two-sided inverse is necessarily equal to both $g$ and $h$ , so the equality to $f^{-1}$ is not immediately clear to me, which suggests I should also prove (3) any other inverse is necessarily equal to $g$ and $h$ .","I'm trying to make sure that I have correctly proved Munkres' Lemma 2.1, which is left to the reader.

71,Number of Inflection Points for Compositions of Exponential Functions,Number of Inflection Points for Compositions of Exponential Functions,,"Lately I've been studying some functions of the form $f_1(f_2(\cdots(f_n(x))\cdots))$ where each $f_i(x) = a_i^x$ for some positive, nonunity, real numbers $a_i$ . So for example, if $a_1 = 2$ and $a_2 = 0.3$ the function would be $2^{0.3^x}$ . A more elaborate example would be the function, $0.9^{e^{1.01^{0.5^x}}}$ . I'm not studying any one particular function, but rather a whole family of them together. Something I've noticed is that they all seem to have at most only one inflection point (alternatively their derivatives have at most one relative extremum). But I cannot seem to prove this result, so it remains an observation. The problem for me has been that the derivatives, even in the small $n=3$ cases are a little too unwieldy. For anyone who is curious, if we denote $F_m^n(x) = f_m(f_{m+1}(\cdots (f_n(x))\cdots))$ (and trivially let $F_{i+1}^i(x) = x$ ) then $$\big(F_m^n\big)^{\prime}(x) = \prod\limits_{i=m}^n F_i^n(x)\ln(a_i)$$ and $$\big(F_m^n\big)^{\prime\prime}(x) = \big(F_m^n\big)^{\prime}(x)\times\bigg(\sum\limits_{i=m}^n\ln(a_i)\Big(F_{i+1}^n\Big)^{\prime}(x)\bigg)$$ Setting the latter factor (the one with the sum) in the second derivative equal to $0$ hasn't given me much success. My suspicion is that there is some argument to be made where you could group the factors of $\big(F_m^n\big)^{\prime}(x)$ by whether they are increasing or decreasing functions (it isn't hard to see that a composition of some number of exponential functions will be either always increasing or always decreasing), like so: $$\big(F_m^n\big)^{\prime}(x) = \Big(\prod\limits_{i=m}^n\ln(a_i)\Big)\times\Big(\prod\limits_{\text{increasing ones}}F_i^n(x)\Big)\times\Big(\prod\limits_{\text{decreasing ones}}F_i^n(x)\Big)$$ and then argue that as $x$ increases from $-\infty$ one of the two latter factors will dominate the other (causing, for example, the whole derivative to increase), and then there will be a point where it switches and the other factor becomes more dominant (causing then an overall decreasing trend). But of course, I could be completely off base on this. I was wondering if anyone knew of some resources to check out for these kinds of functions, maybe knew a counterexample, or perhaps even knew of an actual proof that each of these kinds of functions have at most one inflection point.","Lately I've been studying some functions of the form where each for some positive, nonunity, real numbers .

Proof. The idea is to notice that $J(m,n)$ can also be expressed equivalently as $$ J(m,n)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{m+n}i\right)+m \tag{1} $$ To prove injectivity, suppose $J(m_1,n_1)=J(m_2,n_2)$ . We'll prove $m_1=m_2$ (the fact that $n_1=n_2$ should follow immediately after). For this, suppose that $m_1+n_1<m_2+n_2$ , then using the (1) formulation of $J$ , we have $$\sum_{i=1}^{m_1+n_1}i+ \ m_1=\sum_{i=1}^{m_2+n_2}i+ \ m_2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad m_1=\sum_{i=m_1+n_1+1}^{m_2+n_2}i+ \ m_2$$ which is a contradiction (to see why, subtract $m_1$ from both sides). With similar reasoning we can prove that $m_1+n_1>m_2+n_2$ is impossible as well. Thus we conclude that $m_1+n_1=m_2+n_2$ . Using the original formulation of $J$ we get: $$ [(m_1+n_1)^2+3m_1+n_1]=[(m_2+n_2)^2+3m_2+n_2]. $$ With the fact that $m_1+n_1=m_2+n_2$ , this reduces to $2m_1=2m_2$ , thus $m_1=m_2$ .

Can there exist a class of Bell-Shaped functions that depends on more than three parameters? First of all I shall provide my definition of Bell-Shaped function: Definition : $f: R \rightarrow R$ is said to be a Bell-Shaped function iff: $f \in C^{+ \infty}(\Bbb R)$ ( $f$ is smooth) $\lim_{x \to +\infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = 0$ $f^{(n)}$ has exactly n zeros (let them be denoted in ascending order by $\{z_n^i\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ ) MY ATTEMPT : I have tried using vector spaces, but I immediately realized that a class of same-form Bell-Shaped functions at most constitute an affine subspace (and I am not completely sure of that). Then I started finding necessary conditions for $f$ to be a Bell-Shaped function, e.g.: $\lim_{x \to +\infty} f^{(n)}(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} f^{(n)}(x) = 0$ $z_n^i$ is an inversion point for $f^{(n)}$ However, even this time i didn't find anything useful in order to solve the problem. Finally, I begun playing with the functions given as examples and i noticed that the parameters seemed to control specific elements of the graphs: $A$ defines the maximum height (in absolute value) reached by $f$ $B$ defines the width of the central Bell $C$ defines the position of the point of maximum height Therefore, I am now inclined to think that 3 is actually the maximum number of parameters, but I have no idea on how to prove that, or on how to rigorously define $A,B,C$ .
