11,Area of a circle as it changes to an ellipse when viewing at different angles,Area of a circle as it changes to an ellipse when viewing at different angles,,"Sorry for the long paragraph, I'm not too good at describing things: Firstly, to explain the situation, I need to know how the area of a circle can change as you view it from different angles. For example, if you were viewing a circle at a 0 degree angle, it would look like a circle and it's area would be $\pi r^2$. However, as the angle of observation increases or decreases, one side of the circle will ""collapse"" inwards, and become smaller. It would create an ellipse, where the variable 'a' (longest distance from centre to side) stays the same, and where variable 'b' (the smallest distance from centre to side) decreases. I want to know the best way to find the area, based on the angle theta. For clarification, theta refers to the angle from a line perpendicular to the circle. The best way to approach the issue seemed to be the diagram in the link. In the diagram, the 2 cm long line, is the circle. Therefore, the radius is 1 cm. The best approach I could find, was by using a cos ratio in the triangle highlighted in red as whenever I try any trig rules, it always gets too complicated with multiple variables. The angle closest to the centre of the circle would have to be 90-theta and, if the triangle is right angle (which it was made to be this way), the opposite angle must be theta. Hence by using $\cos \theta = a/h$, where h is the 1cm line, 'a' (which refers to adjacent not the other longer 'a') must be cos theta. This only works if the entire line is 2a. But if it's not and either side is different, then I have a problem. So, I wanted to know, am I right with the above working, or am I wrong. And if I'm wrong, how should I approach this problem differently. Thanks.","Sorry for the long paragraph, I'm not too good at describing things: Firstly, to explain the situation, I need to know how the area of a circle can change as you view it from different angles.

It would create an ellipse, where the variable 'a' (longest distance from centre to side) stays the same, and where variable 'b' (the smallest distance from centre to side) decreases. I want to know the best way to find the area, based on the angle theta. For clarification, theta refers to the angle from a line perpendicular to the circle. The best way to approach the issue seemed to be the diagram in the link. In the diagram, the 2 cm long line, is the circle. Therefore, the radius is 1 cm. The best approach I could find, was by using a cos ratio in the triangle highlighted in red as whenever I try any trig rules, it always gets too complicated with multiple variables. The angle closest to the centre of the circle would have to be 90-theta and, if the triangle is right angle (which it was made to be this way), the opposite angle must be theta. Hence by using $\cos \theta = a/h$, where h is the 1cm line, 'a' (which refers to adjacent not the other longer 'a') must be cos theta. This only works if the entire line is 2a. But if it's not and either side is different, then I have a problem. So, I wanted to know, am I right with the above working, or am I wrong. And if I'm wrong, how should I approach this problem differently. Thanks.",,['trigonometry']

My formulas ONLY work if you fill in the camera's angles (so then the point is in the centre of your screen), but it doesn't work when I add an offset to the angles (like: cos(camera_angle.x+OFFSET), then the point's position isn't right anymore at all. If for example the camera is looking in front towards the horizon, the altitude angle is 0°. when looking down towards the ground, it's -90° (or 270°). When looking up it's +90°. The azimuth angle has a range from 0-360°.  I need to get the right combination of multiplying sin and cos together in order to get the new coordinate on the sphere. But my formulas give me the wrong location of the point. Please help and ask me more details if you need them.",,"['trigonometry', 'spherical-coordinates']"

Consider the parametric equations: $$\begin{align} x &= \sec(\theta) + \tan(\theta) \\ y &= \csc(\theta) + \cot(\theta) \end{align}$$ I would like to express them in Cartesian form. To check my answer, I have used the Desmos Graphing Calculator to draw the graph of the parametric equations ($-\pi<\theta<\pi$): Firstly I find: $$\begin{align} x+\frac{1}{x} &= 2\sec(\theta) \\[4pt] y+\frac{1}{y} &= 2\csc(\theta) \end{align}$$ Dividing the first equation by the second: $$\frac{x+\dfrac{1}{x}}{y+\dfrac{1}{y}}=\tan(\theta)$$ Using both the original parametric equation for $x$ and the one found allows me to simplify to: $$y+\frac{1}{y} = \frac{2\left(x+\dfrac{1}{x}\right)}{x-\dfrac{1}{x}}$$ At that point, I decide to check with Desmos again: This graph seems to include the one found from the parametric equations, but with an extra negative reciprocal curve. At this point, I check the mark scheme for the question, and find that it simplifies to: $$\begin{align} \cos(\theta)&=\frac{2x}{x^2+1} \\[4pt] \sin(\theta)&=\frac{2y}{y^2+1} \end{align}$$ It then uses the identity: $\sin^2A+\cos^2A=1$ to form the following Cartesian equation: $$\frac{4y^2}{(y^2+1)^2}+\frac{4x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}=1$$ Plugging that into Desmos returns: This graph once again includes the original one, but with even more extra reciprocal curves. I think this is because of the squares in the identity used. I then decide to muck around with various reciprocal equations until I find one that matches the first graph. I find: $$y=\frac{2}{x-1}+1$$ At this point, I am very confused. How (if it is possible) can I get from my parametric equations to that final Cartesian equation? Where (if I am going wrong) am I (and the mark scheme) going wrong with the first two attempts?

Only having a correct answer is not sufficient to comb home 5/5 points on a problem like this. Thoughts on improvements on stringency? Is there any logical fallacy or ambiguity? Any input is very welcome! Solution: The domain for $\arctan{x}$ is $\mathbb{R},$ thus the function $\sin{(\arctan{x})}$ is defined over the entire $\mathbb{R}$. However, the restricting factor comes from the fact that the domain for $\arcsin{x}$ is $[-1,1]$ which implies that the domain for $\tan{(\arcsin{x})}$ is $[-\arctan{1},\arctan{1}]=[-\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\pi}{4}].$ We can thus conclude that if there exists a solution $x$ to the above equation, then $x\in[-\frac{\pi}{4},\frac{\pi}{4}]$. First I note that $$\sin{b}=\pm\frac{\tan{b}}{\sqrt{\tan^2{b}+1}}\Rightarrow\sin^2{(\arctan{x})}=\left(\pm\frac{\tan{(\arctan{x})}}{\sqrt{\tan^2{(\arctan{x})}+1}}\right)^2=\frac{x^2}{x^2+1}.$$ Secondly; $$\tan{c}=\pm\frac{\sin{c}}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2{c}}}\Rightarrow \tan^2{\arcsin{x}}=\left(\pm\frac{\sin{(\arcsin{x})}}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2{(\arcsin{x})}}}\right)^2=\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}.$$ So the equation becomes $$\frac{x^2+1-1+x^2}{x^2}=\frac{2x^2}{x^2} =4x^2\Longleftrightarrow x=\pm\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.$$ What's left to do now is to show that these $x:$s both lie in the desired interval. So it boils down to showing that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\leq\frac{\pi}{4}$. This can be done by multiplying the inequality by $\sqrt{2}/\sqrt{2}$: $$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\leq \frac{\pi}{4}\Longleftrightarrow \sqrt{2}\leq \pi,$$ which clearly is true.","I just need help to finetune this solution.
