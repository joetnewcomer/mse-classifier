A general strategy to show this, is to take two functions, say $y=\phi(x)$ and $y=\psi(x)$ such that $\lim_{x\to 0}\phi(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}\psi(x)=0$ and show that $\lim_{x\to 0} f(x,\phi(x))\neq \lim_{x\to 0} f(x,\psi(x))$ (, also we note that, as $x\to 0$ we have, $(x,y)=(x,\phi(x))\to(0,0)$ and $(x,y)=(x,\phi(x))\to (0,0)$ ). We let $y=\phi(x)=x$ and $y=\psi(x)=x^2.$ We have, $$f(x,y)=\begin{cases} \cfrac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}, & x\neq 0 \\ 0,&x=0 \end{cases}$$ and so, if $L=\lim_{(x,y)\to (0,0)} f(x,y)$ exists then, $L=\lim_{x\to 0}f(x,\phi(x))=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^3}{x^4+x^2}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x}{x^2+1}=0$ . Again, $L=\lim_{x\to 0}f(x,\psi(x))=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{x^4}{x^4+x^4}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{2}=\frac 12.$ This is what we've wanted to show and $L=\frac 12$ gives us a contradiction as $\frac 12\neq 0.$ So, $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist. This proves that at $(0,0)$ the function is discontinuous if $\beta=0.$ On second thought, I tried to prove the same thing using the ""approach of polar  coordinates' as follows: Just like the previous approach, we try to show that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)$ does not exist but this time using polar coordinates.
