32,An IMO training problem: Living in an overpopulated apartment,An IMO training problem: Living in an overpopulated apartment,,"Here is a problem from the book 102 Combinatorial Problems: From the Training of the USA IMO Team by Titu Andreescu and Zuming Feng : Original problem: A total of $119$ residents live in a building with $120$ apartments. We call an apartment overpopulated if there are at least $15$ people living there. Every day the inhabitants of an overpopulated apartment have a quarrel and each goes off to a different apartment in the building (so they can avoid each other). Is it true that this process will necessarily be completed someday? Extension (Self-made): If after $n$ days the process is completed, what is the maximum value of $n$ ? Solution from the book Let $p_1,p_2,\cdots,p_{120}$ denote the $120$ apartments, and let $a_i$ denote the number of residents in apartment $p_i$ . We consider the quantity $$\color{red}{\textrm{S=$\frac{a_1(a_1-1)}{2}+\frac{a_2(a_2-1)}{2}+\cdots+\frac{a_{120}(a_{120}-1)}{2}$}}$$ ( Assume that all the residents in an apartment shake hand with each other at the beginning of the day, then quantity $S$ denotes the number of the handshakes in that day .) If all $a_i < 15$ , then the process is completed and we are done.

33,How many rectangles can be found in this shape?,How many rectangles can be found in this shape?,,"Question : How many rectangles can be found in the following shape? My first solution: Let $a_n$ be the number of rectangles in such a shape with side length $n$ . Then, the number of the newly added $1 \times k$ rectangles while expanding the shape with side length $n-1$ to the shape with side length $n$ is, $n^2$ . Similarly, the number of the newly added $2 \times k$ rectangles while expanding is, $(n-2)^2$ , the number of the $3 \times k$ ones is $(n-4)^2$ , and so on. So, we have, $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 1^2+3^2+\ldots +n^2$$ or, $$a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^2+4^2+\ldots +n^2$$ depending on the parity of $n$ . In either case, we have $$a_n=a_{n-2}+1^2+2^2+ \ldots n^2$$ So, $a_{n+1} = a_{n-1} + 1^2+2^2+ \ldots (n+1)^2$ . Subtracting both sides, we have, $a_{n+1}-a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} + (n+1)^2$ . Repeating the same method, we obtain $$a_{n+1}-4a_n+5a_{n-1} = 5a_{n-3} - 4a_{n-4}+a_{n-5}$$ This recurrence relation has characteristic equation $r^6-4r^5+5r^4-5r^2+4r-1=0 \iff (r-1)^5 \cdot (r+1) = 0$ . So, using the usual ways to solve recurrence relations, we can obtain $a_n=\frac{n^4}{24} + \frac{n^3}{4} + \frac{11n^2}{24} + \frac{n}{4} = \binom{n+3}{4}$ . However, since the answer is so simple, I tried to solve it with a method which can give the result in a more 'direct' way: Let us find these rectangles by choosing 2 rows and 2 columns and looking at their intersection. If we choose the right most column, we have $n$ choices for the other column and only $1$ choice for the rows. If we choose column which is the second from right, we have $n-1$ choices for the other column (in order not to over count), and, $\binom{2+2-1}{2}$ (number of ways to choose 2 rows out of 2 rows including repetitions) choices for the row. Using this argument, we can obtain, $$a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n-k) \cdot \binom{(k+1)+2-1}{2} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n-k) \cdot \binom{k+2}{2}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-k) \cdot (k+2) \cdot (k+1)}{2}$$ After some computation, we can see from here that $a_n=\binom{n+3}{4}$ . However, I think this solution is also overcomplicated and I think that there is a really elegant and/or 'direct' solution for this problem. So, my question is, how can this problem be solved with a 'direct' method (for example, a combinatorial method which immediately gives the number as $\binom{n+3}{4}$ )?

34,Relation between Pascal's Triangle and Euler's Number,Relation between Pascal's Triangle and Euler's Number,,"My friends and myself were discussing Pascal's Triangle, specifically the following property of it. First, consider the Pascal's Triangle - $$1\\ 1\ 1\\ 1\ 2\ 1\\ 1\ 3\ 3\ 1\\ 1\ 4\ 6\ 4\ 1\\ 1\ 5\ 10\ 10\ 5\ 1\\ 1\ 6\ 15\ 20\ 15\ 6\ 1\\ ..................\\ .....................$$ Now, one interesting observation that can be easily spotted is that initial rows of the Pascal's Triangle follow the form $11^n$ and then a few of the following rows follow $101^n$ and so on. Now, if we deform the above argument as the following: The zeroth row is of form $(1.1)^0$ The first row is of the form $(1.1)^1$ Similarly the second row as $(1.1)^2$ the following one as $(1.1)^3$ and then the fourth row as $(1.1)^4$ Now for the immediate next row if we follow the pattern shown above we get overflow due to digits being carried forward and hence we represent the fifth row as $(1.01)^5$ yielding $1.0510100501$ . Now again we keep on proceeding with the introduction of more zeroes after the decimal point for preventing overflow and preserving the form of the Pascal's Triangle. Consider the following idea, the $n^\text{th}$ row can be represented as following $(1.\overbrace{000.....0}^{n}1)^n$ . Now I grossly miscalculated this, previously. As $n \to \infty$ this value becomes equal to $1$ . Due to the fatal error above, as pointed out in the answers, I rephrase the initial question as: Is there any way to make this series converge to e with the adding of zeroes suitably as needed? Also, later on studying the Pascal's Triangle further I found another interesting relation. Consider, $f(n)$ to be the product of all digits in the $n^\text{th}$ row of the Pascal's Triangle. Also, consider the beginning to be the zeroth row. Then, with algebraic manipulation we obtain: $$\frac{f(n)}{f(n-1)} = \frac{n^{(n-1)}}{(n-1)!}$$ from which we can further deduce that $\frac{f(n+1) \times f(n-1)}{f(n)^2}$ converges to $e$ as $n \to \infty$ i.e., $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n+1) \times f(n-1)}{f(n)^2} = e$$ Since, I have updated the problem statement, I am not very sure if the following questions hold . can we connect the initial observation with above observation? is there some correlation between the number $e$ and the product of its digits?

This seems to be more natural to me considering the geometric realization (we don't take point-sets twice), and the notion of the interior and closure of a simplex is much more natural. However, this approach seems to be quite rare in the literature. Is there a good reason to consider closed simplices and do both theories coincide?","a_0,...,a_k \mathbb{R}^N N\ge k k \sigma \sigma=\{\sum_{i=1}^kt_ia_i|t_0+...+t_k=1, t_i\ge 0\} K \mathbb{R}^n K \sigma\in K \sigma=\{\sum_{i=1}^kt_ia_i|t_0+...t_k=1, t_i > 0\}","['combinatorics', 'general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'geometric-topology']"

My Attempt : Each integer in domain has $4$ choices and therefore the total number of functions is $f$ is $4^{1999}.$ Since there are an equal number of functions that yield odd or even result, we can directly write that the number of functions satisfying the above condition to be $2*4^{1998}.$ I am unsure about this last claim and would like to prove it (if it is true.)Also is the answer to this problem correct? Edit $1$: I tried to proceed further in the following manner: For a given mapping $f$ let the number of integers assigned to $2000,2001,2002$ amd $2003$ be $p,q,r$ and $s$ respectively, where $p,q,r,s\in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

99,Estimate the coefficients of a polynomial against its maximum,Estimate the coefficients of a polynomial against its maximum,,"For $d, m \in\mathbb{N}$ fixed, let $P\equiv P(x) := \sum_{|\alpha|\leq m} c_\alpha\cdot x^\alpha$ be a real polynomial in $d$ variables of (total) degree $m$ . (I.e., the above sum ranges over all multiindices $\alpha=(i_1, \ldots, i_d)\in\mathbb{N}_0^{\times d}$ of length $|\alpha|\equiv i_1+\ldots + i_d$ less than $m$ .) I was wondering if it is somehow possible to estimate the maximum coefficient $\|c_\alpha\|_\infty := \max_{|\alpha|\leq m}|c_\alpha|$ of $P$ against its uniform norm $\|P\|_{\infty;K}:= \sup_{x\in K}|P(x)|$ , for $K$ some compact set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (ideally something like the closed unit ball, but whatever compact set works). That is, does there exist a constant $\kappa \equiv \kappa(m,d,K)>0$ such that $$\tag{1}\|c_\alpha\|_\infty \ \leq \ \kappa\cdot \|P\|_{\infty; K} \qquad \text{ for each } \ P \ \text{ as above}?$$ Any references are welcome.","For fixed, let be a real polynomial in variables of (total) degree .
