3,How to evaluate $\int\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{2\sin(x)- x(1+\cos(x))}\right)^2dx$?,How to evaluate ?,\int\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{2\sin(x)- x(1+\cos(x))}\right)^2dx,"I saw this problem: $$\int\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{2\sin(x)- x(1+\cos(x))}\right)^2dx$$ I tried to solve this problem and I found a strange and unsatisfactory solution using differential equations. Let $$I:=\int\left(\frac{\sin(x)}{2\sin(x)- x(1+\cos(x))}\right)^2dx$$ and let $x=2t$ . Then $$I=\frac{1}{2}\int\left(\frac{\sin(t)\cos(t)}{\sin(t)\cos(t)- t\cos^2(t)}\right)^2dt=\frac{1}{2}\int\left(\frac{\sin(t)}{\sin(t)- t\cos(t)}\right)^2dt$$ Since $\frac{d}{dt}\frac{v}{u} = \frac{uv'-vu'}{u^2}$ and the integral is in the form $\frac{uv'-vu'}{u^2}$ , such that $u =\sin(t)- t\cos(t)$ and $u' =t\sin(t)$ , we need to find a function $v(t)$ such that $v'(t)(\sin(t)- t\cos(t)) -v(t)(t \sin(t)) =\sin^2(t)$ or $$-t(  \sin(t)v(t) +\cos(t) v'(t) ) + v'(t) \sin(t) =\sin^2(t)$$ Since $\sin^2(t)$ is not a multiple of $t$ , we can assume that $\sin(t)v(t) +\cos(t) v'(t)=0$ , i.e., $v(t) =- \cos(t)$ , and then $v'(t) \sin(t)=\sin^2(t)$ will solve this differential equation.

If  then the set Y where p(x) = 0 is dense,"p p(x) \ge 0, x \in [a, b] \int_{a}^{b} p(x)dx = 0,","I'm studying for a Master's admission exam and I came across this question: Let $p : [a, b] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ integrable, with $p(x) \ge 0,$ for every $x \in [a, b]$ . If $\int_{a}^{b} p(x)dx = 0,$ then the set $Y = \{x \mid p(x) = 0\}$ is dense in $[a, b]$ . I saw that you already asked about this question here (I can't put the link) and they talked about using measurement theory. I could not understand the solutions presented, so I would like to try to present a solution. I don't have any knowledge about Measure Theory. Suppose that $Y$ is not dense in $[a, b]$ . Then there exists a point $\alpha \in [a, b]$ and $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $$(\alpha - \varepsilon, \alpha + \varepsilon) \ \cap \ Y = \emptyset.$$ Let $[\beta_1, \beta_2] \subset (\alpha - \varepsilon, \alpha + \varepsilon) \subset [a, b].$ Then $$ [\beta_1, \beta_2]\ \cap \ Y = \emptyset.$$ We say that $f$ is Riemann-integrable iff the set of points of discontinuities of f has measure zero. Since $p$ is integrable and $[a, b]$ don't have measure zero, $p$ it must be continuous at at least one point $x \in [a, b]$ . Again, let's assume that $p$ is discontinuous at all points in the interval $(\alpha - \varepsilon, \alpha + \varepsilon)$ . Then $p$ is discontinuous in $[\beta_1, \beta_2]$ . But $p$ is integrable in $[\beta_1, \beta_2]$ and $[\beta_1, \beta_2]$ has non-zero measure, wich is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be some point $y \in $ $[\beta_1, \beta_2]$ where $p$ is continuous. Note that $p(y) > 0$ . Soon $$\int_{\beta_1}^{\beta_2} p(x)dx > 0.$$ Following that $$\int_{a}^{b} p(x)dx = \int_{a}^{\beta_1} p(x)dx + \int_{\beta_1}^{\beta_2} p(x)dx + \int_{\beta_2}^{b} p(x)dx$$ $$\Rightarrow 0 = \int_{a}^{\beta_1} p(x)dx + \int_{\beta_1}^{\beta_2} p(x)dx + \int_{\beta_2}^{b} p(x)dx$$ which again is a contradiction, since $\int_{a}^{\beta_1} p(x)dx, \int_{\beta_2}^{b} p(x)dx \geq 0 $ .

So we cannot just write $$\int_{M} 1 \,\mathrm{d}m = \operatorname{vol}(M)$$ since we would be getting different, coordinate-dependent volumes for the same figures. The solution, as given in most differential geometry books, is to induce the measure from the tangent spaces via the anti-symmetric covariant tensor fields, aka differential n-norms, which give you a ""signed length meter to each 1-dimensional subspace of each tangent space in a coordinate independent way"". In other words, we get stuff like ""the integral of the covector field $\omega$ over a curve $\gamma$ "": $$\int_{\gamma} \omega = \int_{[a,b]} \gamma^*\omega$$ or integrate the covector field $\omega$ over $U$ (well-definedly using coordinate charts) $$\int_{U} \omega = \int_{\varphi(U)} (\varphi^{-1})^* \omega$$ QUESTION At this point, I lost the connection between the original problem and the proposed solution. Our problem was that we cannot measure volumes because of the coordinate dependency. Is my understanding correct that we replace sets (whose volumes we want to measure) by expressing these sets as images of $\mathbb{R}^k$ -valued functions and accordingly integrating $k$ -forms over them? If that is so, is there an intuitive, non-rigorous way to explain why a real number that we get in the end for the integral is not coordinate-dependent?

27,Why do we need surface and line integrals when we already have the Lebesgue integral?,Why do we need surface and line integrals when we already have the Lebesgue integral?,,"I really don't understand why we need surface and line integrals when we can already integrate on Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$ . Aren't surfaces and curves Lebesgue measurable sets? I will write here exactly how surface integrals and line integrals were defined to me because I suspect that my lecturer doesn't take the canonical approach (see this other question of mine about the notation for an inner product that I am going to use and that he uses). A (space) curve $\gamma$ is a $C^1$ class function defined on some compact set $[a, b]\subset \mathbb{R}$ that takes values in $\mathbb{R}^3$ , i.e. $\gamma:[a, b]\to \mathbb{R}^3$ is a $C^1$ class function putting words into notation. We say that a function $F:\gamma([a, b])\to \mathbb{R}^3$ is integrable on $\gamma$ if the function $(F\circ \gamma | \gamma')_{\mathbb{R}^3}:[a, b]\to \mathbb{R}$ is $\lambda_1$ -integrable on [a, b], where $\lambda_1$ is the Lebesgue measure on $[a, b]$ (so the one dimensional Lebesgue measure, hence the $1$ ). In this case, we define $$\int_{\gamma}(F|dl)_{\mathbb{R}^3}=\int_{[a,b]}(F\circ \gamma | \gamma')d\lambda_1.$$ Similarly, a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is a $C^1$ class function $\sigma:[a_1, b_1]\times [a_2, b_2]\to \mathbb{R}^3$ and we say that a function $F:\sigma([a_1, b_1]\times[a_2, b_2])\to \mathbb{R}^3$ is integrable on $\sigma$ if $(F\circ \sigma | \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}\times \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial v}):[a_1, b_1]\times [a_2, b_2]\to \mathbb{R}$ is $\lambda_2$ -integrable on $[a_1, b_1]\times[a_2, b_2]$ (here $\lambda_2$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$ ). In this case, we define $$\int_{\sigma}(F|ds)_{\mathbb{R}^3}=\int_{\sigma}\left(F\circ \sigma | \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial u}\times \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial v}\right)_\mathbb{R}^3 d\lambda_2.$$ What I don't get is why we need these definitions to integrate on, say, $\gamma$ . Basically, won't $\gamma([a, b])\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be Lebesgue measurable because it is a compact set (it is the continuous image of a compact set)? Don't I just know already how to integrate on $\gamma([a, b])$ since I know how to do Lebesgue integrals? The definition given by my professor actually looks like some kind of change of variable to me, i.e. I believe that we can in fact write $\displaystyle \int_{\gamma([a, b])}F(x, y, z) dxdydz$ without any further ado and he just makes the change of variable $(x, y, z)=\gamma(t)$ , giving him that this equals $\displaystyle \int_{[a,b]}(F\circ \gamma | \gamma')d\lambda_1$ , and he just decides to call this the definition of the integral on $\gamma$ purely for computational convenience, even though the notion is allready well defined. Am I correct? This is purely intuitive, I haven't learned the change of variable for the Lebesgue integral. I don't really see any other point in calling this a definition if we are using the Lebesgue measure and our curves and surfaces are $C^1$ so that we can make different changes of variable. If we were to use Riemann integrals instead of Lebesgue integrals, I think that we indeed need to define what it means to integrate on some curve $\gamma$ or some surface $\sigma$ simply because compact sets are not necessarily Jordan measurable (and as far as I am concerned we can't really do Riemann integrals on sets that are not Jordan mesurable even if they are bounded - this is simply because we will end up with some continuous functions not being integrable and this is definitely not something we want). So yeah, in that case we would be integrating on some ""new"" sets, but in my setting I don't really see the point. EDIT: I should also say that I am basically assuming some regularity on $F$ , i.e. that it is Lebesgue integrable, but this feels natural.","I really don't understand why we need surface and line integrals when we can already integrate on Lebesgue measurable subsets of .

I've tried to come up with a dyadic decomposition strategy that yields this bound but something appears to be alluding me. What dyadic decomposition strategy might yield this bound? Below is the approach my intuition suggests, which might guide your answer, but if there is an obvious approach that I am missing, there is no need to read the approach below: If we define $\beta_0(x)$ to be a smooth function equal to $1$ on $[-1,1]$ and vanishing outside of $[-2,2]$ , and then define $\beta_n(x) = \beta_0(x/2^n) - \beta_0(x/2^{n-1})$ , then for each $x \in \mathbf{R}$ , $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \beta_n(x) = 1$ .

I want to isolate the behaviour of the integral when $|x| \lesssim \lambda^{-1/2}$ , where the phase is stationary, so I might want to decompose the integral as $$ \int a(x) e^{\lambda i x^2} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \int a(x) \beta_n(x \cdot \lambda^{1/2}) e^{\lambda i x^2}. $$ However, for $n \geq 1$ , I am unable to obtain any better bound than $$ \left| \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \int \beta_n(x \cdot \lambda^{1/2}) e^{\lambda i x^2} \right| \lesssim \lambda^{-1/2}. $$ Even if I was able to obtain a bound $O(\lambda^{-N})$ for this term, it seems unclear how we might reintroduce the amplitude $a$ to obtain a bound on $$ \left| \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \int a(x) \beta_n(x \cdot \lambda^{1/2}) e^{\lambda i x^2} \right|. $$ We can certainly sum up to $n \lesssim \log(\lambda^{1/2})$ , where $\beta_n(x \cdot \lambda^{1/2}) a(x) = \beta_n(x \cdot \lambda^{1/2})$ , but for $n \gtrsim \log(\lambda^{1/2})$ we obtain problems because $a$ modifies the behaviour of $\beta_n$ .","In Terence Tao's notes on oscillatory integrals, Tao mentions that if is a smooth, compactly supported phase, with in a neighborhood of the origin, then for any , He mentions that this bound can be proven by 'a dyadic decomposition'.

[duplicate],\int_C\frac{dz}{z}=2\pi i,"This question already has answers here : Cauchy's Theorem on Path Integrals (3 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I was thinking that I don't really understand why $$\int_{|z|=1}\frac{dz}{z}=2\pi i$$ I do understand how to calculate it and it's importance for residues, Cauchy etc... The question is that, if $f(z)=z^{-1}$ , then $f(z)=\overline{z}$ when $|z|=1$ , somehow there must be an asymmetry in $f(z)$ along $|z|=1$ in order for the integral to be $2\pi$ units up in the imaginary axis. If $C$ is the unit circle traversed in the natural (anticlockwise) direction at ""1 m/s speed""(i.e. $e^{i\theta}$ for $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$ ) then $f(C)$ is again the unit circle traversed at ""1 m/s"" speed but in a clockwise manner. Then again, I don't see any asymmetry: you will pass both by $z$ and $-z$ and those should cancel giving $0$ as the value of the integral. I tried to think of the line integral in terms of area: $ie^{i\theta}$ is the tangent vector to the curve at $z=e^{i\theta}$ and an infinitesimal triangle (or circle sector) should have area $\frac{1}{2}ie^{i\theta}e^{i\theta}$ . Couldn't get any further because what meaning does ""complex number value area"" mean? Is there some interpretation? I am not convinced that the $\gamma'(t)$ factor appearing in the calculations really makes the difference (or how it would). Just to add to my controversy, the function $f(z)=z^{-2}$ takes the unit circle into the unit circle but ""changes speeds"" by which I mean that it gives somehow ""more weight"" to some points (it stretches the upper semicircle into the whole circle) Maybe the question sounds stupid and I hope it does have a simple explanation.

71,A question about union of non-overlapping intervals and its relation to Arzelà's theorem,A question about union of non-overlapping intervals and its relation to Arzelà's theorem,,"While trying to answer this question I initially tried to argue via contradiction and was led to the following result: Unproved Theorem : For each positive integer $n$ let $J_n$ be a union of finite number of non-overlapping (closed) sub-intervals of $[a, b] $ . And further let the combined length of sub-intervals in $J_n$ be greater than or equal to $\delta>0$ for all $n$ . Then there is at least one point $c\in[a, b] $ which lies in infinitely many $J_n$ . Two intervals are non-overlapping if their interiors are disjoint. Unfortunately I was unable to prove the theorem and I need some help here. Also approaches without the use of measure theory are desired as I was able to answer the linked question using measure theory. The relation between the above theorem and the linked question is based on the fact that if a Riemann integral is positive then the function being integrated is positive on some union like $J_n$ . More formally Apostol proves the following theorem in an exercise (see Exercise 7.35, page 180, Mathematical Analysis ): Theorem : Let $f:[a, b] \to\mathbb {R} $ be a non-negative Riemann integrable function such that $I=\int_{a} ^{b} f(x) \, dx>0$ . Let $M$ be a positive bound for $f$ and $\delta=\dfrac{I} {2(M+b-a)}$ . Then the set $A=\{x\mid f(x) \geq \delta\} $ contains a finite number of non-overlapping intervals whose combined length is at least $\delta$ . Here is one approach which sounds promising but there are certain doubts. Let's assume on the contrary that no such point $c$ exists. Then for each $x\in[a, b] $ there is a positive integer $n_x$ such that $x\notin J_n$ for all $n\geq n_x$ . Since $J_n$ is closed it follows that there is a neighborhood $I_x$ such that $I_x\cap J_n=\emptyset $ for all $n\geq n_x$ . By Heine Borel we can choose a finite number of such neighborhoods say $I_{x_1},\dots,I_{x_p}$ which cover $[a, b] $ . Let $N$ be the maximum of $n_{x_1},\dots,n_{x_p}$ . Then $[a, b] \cap J_n=\emptyset $ for $n\geq N$ and this is a contradiction. The problem with above proof is that the value $\delta$ is used nowhere. That part of hypotheses seems crucial. The problem with the above proof is found and the wrong inference is striked out. I will let the above wrong proof be there so that readers can avoid it. Update : On further investigation as well as looking at this answer of the linked question, it appears that the unproved theorem mentioned above is equivalent to the theorem of Arzelà: Arzelà's Theorem : Let $\{f_n\} $ be a sequence of functions $f_n:[a, b] \to\mathbb {R} $ such that each $f_n$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b] $ and let $|f_n(x)|\leq M$ for all positive integers $n$ and all $x\in[a, b] $ . Further let $f_n$ converge point wise to a Riemann integrable function $f$ on $[a, b] $ . Then $\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx\to\int_{a} ^{b} f(x) \, dx$ . By considering the functions $f_n-f$ the above theorem is reduced to the special case when $f(x) =0$ for all $x\in[a, b] $ . Thus let $f_n(x) \to 0$ for all $x\in[a, b] $ and $|f_n(x)| \leq M$ for all $x\in[a, b] $ and all $n\in\mathbb {N} $ . Also since $|\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx|\leq \int_{a} ^{b} |f_n(x) |\, dx$ the theorem is reduced to the case when each $f_n$ is non-negative. Thus Arzelà's theorem is reduced to the equivalent simpler formulation: Arzelà's Theorem (Simplified) : Let $\{f_n\} $ be a sequence of non-negative Riemann integrable functions $f_n:[a, b] \to\mathbb{R} $ which converges to $0$ point wise on $[a, b] $ and let $f_n(x) \leq M$ for all $x\in[a, b] $ and all $n\in\mathbb {N} $ . Then $\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx$ converges to $0$ . Arguing by contradiction let us suppose that $\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx$ does not converge to $0$ . Then there is an $\epsilon>0$ and a subsequence $f_{n_k} $ such that $\int_{a} ^{b} f_{n_k} (x) \, dx\geq \epsilon$ . Without any loss of generality we can assume the subsequence $f_{n_k} $ to be the entire sequence $f_n$ . Thus we have $\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx\geq \epsilon $ . And by the theorem from Apostol's exercise this means that if $\delta=\dfrac{\epsilon} {2(M+b-a)}$ then the set $A_n=\{x\mid f_n(x) \geq\delta\} $ contains a union $J_n$ of non-overlapping subintervals of $[a, b] $ whose combined length is not less than $\delta$ . By the theorem stated at the beginning of this post there is a point $c\in[a, b] $ which lies in infinitely many $J_n$ and hence $f_n(c) \geq \delta$ for infinitely many $n$ . This contradicts the hypotheses that $f_n$ converges to $0$ point wise on $[a, b] $ . This completes the proof of Arzelà's theorem. Assuming the truth of Arzelà's theorem one can prove the theorem mentioned in the beginning of this post. Let's just take $f_n$ to be the indicator function of $J_n$ . If every $x\in[a, b] $ lies only in a finite number of $J_n$ then $f_n$ converges point wise to $0$ on $[a, b] $ . It can be checked that all hypotheses of Arzelà's theorem are satisfied and hence the integrals $\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx$ converge to $0$ . But these integrals represent the length of $J_n$ which is at least $\delta$ and thus we reach a contradiction. In this manner we see that the theorem mentioned in beginning of the post is equivalent to the theorem of Arzelà.","While trying to answer this question I initially tried to argue via contradiction and was led to the following result: Unproved Theorem : For each positive integer let be a union of finite number of non-overlapping (closed) sub-intervals of .

Update : On further investigation as well as looking at this answer of the linked question, it appears that the unproved theorem mentioned above is equivalent to the theorem of Arzelà: Arzelà's Theorem : Let be a sequence of functions such that each is Riemann integrable on and let for all positive integers and all . Further let converge point wise to a Riemann integrable function on . Then . By considering the functions the above theorem is reduced to the special case when for all . Thus let for all and for all and all . Also since the theorem is reduced to the case when each is non-negative. Thus Arzelà's theorem is reduced to the equivalent simpler formulation: Arzelà's Theorem (Simplified) : Let be a sequence of non-negative Riemann integrable functions which converges to point wise on and let for all and all . Then converges to . Arguing by contradiction let us suppose that does not converge to . Then there is an and a subsequence such that . Without any loss of generality we can assume the subsequence to be the entire sequence . Thus we have . And by the theorem from Apostol's exercise this means that if then the set contains a union of non-overlapping subintervals of whose combined length is not less than . By the theorem stated at the beginning of this post there is a point which lies in infinitely many and hence for infinitely many . This contradicts the hypotheses that converges to point wise on . This completes the proof of Arzelà's theorem. Assuming the truth of Arzelà's theorem one can prove the theorem mentioned in the beginning of this post. Let's just take to be the indicator function of . If every lies only in a finite number of then converges point wise to on . It can be checked that all hypotheses of Arzelà's theorem are satisfied and hence the integrals converge to . But these integrals represent the length of which is at least and thus we reach a contradiction. In this manner we see that the theorem mentioned in beginning of the post is equivalent to the theorem of Arzelà.","n J_n [a, b]  J_n \delta>0 n c\in[a, b]  J_n J_n f:[a, b] \to\mathbb {R}  I=\int_{a} ^{b} f(x) \, dx>0 M f \delta=\dfrac{I} {2(M+b-a)} A=\{x\mid f(x) \geq \delta\}  \delta c x\in[a, b]  n_x x\notin J_n n\geq n_x J_n I_x I_x\cap J_n=\emptyset  n\geq n_x I_{x_1},\dots,I_{x_p} [a, b]  N n_{x_1},\dots,n_{x_p} [a, b] \cap J_n=\emptyset  n\geq N \delta \{f_n\}  f_n:[a, b] \to\mathbb {R}  f_n [a, b]  |f_n(x)|\leq M n x\in[a, b]  f_n f [a, b]  \int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx\to\int_{a} ^{b} f(x) \, dx f_n-f f(x) =0 x\in[a, b]  f_n(x) \to 0 x\in[a, b]  |f_n(x)| \leq M x\in[a, b]  n\in\mathbb {N}  |\int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx|\leq \int_{a} ^{b} |f_n(x) |\, dx f_n \{f_n\}  f_n:[a, b] \to\mathbb{R}  0 [a, b]  f_n(x) \leq M x\in[a, b]  n\in\mathbb {N}  \int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx 0 \int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx 0 \epsilon>0 f_{n_k}  \int_{a} ^{b} f_{n_k} (x) \, dx\geq \epsilon f_{n_k}  f_n \int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx\geq \epsilon  \delta=\dfrac{\epsilon} {2(M+b-a)} A_n=\{x\mid f_n(x) \geq\delta\}  J_n [a, b]  \delta c\in[a, b]  J_n f_n(c) \geq \delta n f_n 0 [a, b]  f_n J_n x\in[a, b]  J_n f_n 0 [a, b]  \int_{a} ^{b} f_n(x) \, dx 0 J_n \delta","['real-analysis', 'integration']"

78,How to evaluate this Riemann integral using this definition?,How to evaluate this Riemann integral using this definition?,,"First of all, here are Definitions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: Definition 6.1: Let $[a, b]$ be a given interval. By a partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ we mean a finite set of points $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$, where    $$ a = x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_{n-1} \leq x_n = b.$$   We write    $$ \Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1} \qquad (i = 1, \ldots, n). $$    Now suppose $f$ is a bounded real function defined on $[a, b]$. Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ we put   $$ \begin{align}  M_i &= \sup f(x) \qquad (x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i), \\ m_i &= \inf f(x) \qquad (x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i), \\ U(P, f) &= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta x_i, \\ L(P, f) &= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta x_i, \end{align}  $$   and finally    $$  \begin{align} \tag{1} \overline{\int}_a^b f dx &= \inf U(P, f), \\ \tag{2} \underline{\int}_a^b f dx &= \sup L(P, f), \end{align} $$   where the $\inf$ and the $\sup$ are taken over all partitions $P$ of $[a, b]$. The left members of (1) and (2) are called the upper and lower Riemann integrals of $f$ over $[a, b]$, respectively. If the upper and lower integrals are equal, we say that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$, we write $f \in \mathscr{R}$ (that is, $\mathscr{R}$ denotes the set of Riemann-integrable functions), and we denote the common value of (1) and (2) by    $$ \tag{3} \int_a^b f dx, $$   or by    $$ \tag{4} \int_a^b f(x) dx. $$   This is the Riemann integral of $f$ over $[a, b]$. Since $f$ is bounded, there exist two numbers, $m$ and $M$, such that    $$ m \leq f(x) \leq M \qquad (a \leq x \leq b). $$   Hence, for every $P$,    $$ m(b-a) \leq L(P, f) \leq U(P, f) \leq M (b-a), $$   so that the numbers $L(P, f)$ and $U(P, f)$ form a bounded set. This shows that the upper and lower integrals are defined for every bounded function $f$. . . . Definition 6.2: Let $\alpha$ be a monotonically increasing function on $[a, b]$ (since $\alpha(a)$ and $\alpha(b)$ are finite, it follows that $\alpha$ is bounded on $[a, b]$). Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we write    $$ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha \left( x_i \right) -  \alpha \left( x_{i-1} \right). $$   It is clear that $\Delta \alpha_i \geq 0$. For any real function $f$ which is bounded on $[a, b]$ we put    $$  \begin{align} U(P, f, \alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta \alpha_i, \\ L(P, f, \alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta \alpha_i,  \end{align} $$   where $M_i$, $m_i$ have the same meaning as in Definition 6.1, and we define    $$ \begin{align} \tag{5} \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha = \inf U(P, f, \alpha), \\ \tag{6} \underline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha = \sup L(P, f, \alpha),  \end{align} $$   the $\inf$ and $\sup$ again being taken over all partitions. If the left members of (5) and (6) are equal, we denote their common value by    $$ \tag{7} \int_a^b f d \alpha $$   or sometimes by    $$ \tag{8} \int_a^b f(x) d \alpha(x). $$   This is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral (or simply the Stieltjes integral ) of $f$ with respect to $\alpha$, over $[a, b]$. If (7) exists, i.e., if (5) and (6) are equal, we say that $f$ is integrable with respect to $\alpha$, in the Riemann sense, and write $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$. By taking $\alpha(x) = x$, the Riemann integral is seen to be a special case of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. . . . Definition 6.3: We say that the partition $P^*$ is a refinement of [a partition] $P$ if $P^* \supset P$ (that is, if every point of $P$ is also a point of $P^*$). Given two partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$, we say that $P^*$ is their common refinement if $P^* = P_1 \cup P_2$. Now using this machinery how can we evaluate the integral  $$ \int_0^1 x^2 \ \mathrm{d} x? $$ Next, here are Theorems 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9: Theorem 6.4: If $P^*$ is a refinement of $P$, then    $$ \tag{9} L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) $$   and    $$ \tag{10} U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$ And, so we have  $$ L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$ Theorem 6.6: $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ such that    $$ U(P, f, \alpha ) - L( P, f, \alpha ) < \varepsilon. $$ Theorem 6.8: If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$. Theorem 6.9: If $f$ is monotonic on $[a, b]$ and $\alpha$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$. (We still assume, of course, that $\alpha$ is monotonic.) The function $f(x) = x^2$ is of course continuous as well as monotonic on the interval $[0, 1]$. Thus by either Theorem 6.8 or Theorem 6.9, our integral exists of course. My Attempt: Let $$P = \left\{ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n \right\}, $$   where    $$ 0 = x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_{n-1} < x_n, $$   be a partition of $[0, 1]$. Then as our function $f$ is sttictly increasing on $[0, 1]$, so we find that, for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we have    $$ m_i = f \left( x_{i-1} \right) = x_{i-1}^2 \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad M_i = f \left( x_i \right) = x_i^2. $$   [Refer to Definition 6.1 above for notation.]  Therefore   $$ L(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i-1}^2 \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right) \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad U(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}^2 \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right).  $$ Now from these two formulas, can we compute the quantities in (1) and (2) in Definition 6.1 above? I have no idea of how we can. However, we can do the following trick: Let us put    $$ h \colon= \min \left\{ \ \Delta x_1, \ldots, \Delta x_n \ \right\}. $$   Then of course this $h$ satisfies    $$ 0 < h \leq 1, $$   from which we obtain    $$ \frac{1}{h} \geq 1. $$   Now let us put   $$ k = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{h} \right\rfloor + 1. $$   This $k$ is of course a natural number, and  we also have the inequality   $$ k-1 \leq \frac{1}{h} < k.$$   Now let $P^\prime$ be the partition of $[0, 1]$ given by   $$ P^\prime \colon= \left\{ \ 0, \frac{1}{k}, \ldots, \frac{k-1}{k}, 1 \ \right\}, $$   and let    $$ P^* \colon= P \cup P^\prime. $$   Then by Theorem 6.4  in Baby Rudin, we have the following two sets of inequalities:   $$ L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$   And,    $$ L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U\left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right). $$ Now for the partition $P^\prime$, we compute    $$ L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0 }^{n-1} \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 = \frac{ (k-1) (2k-1 ) }{6k^2} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) \left( 2 - \frac{1}{k} \right), $$   and    $$ U \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1 }^n \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{ (k+1) (2k + 1 ) }{6k^2} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{k} \right) \left( 2 + \frac{1}{k} \right). $$   And, the supremum of all the lower sums $L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right)$ and the infimum of all the upper sums $U \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right)$ obtained in this manner each equals $1/3$. How to prove from here (or using some other device) that  $$ \int_0^1 x^2 \ \mathrm{d} x = \frac{1}{3}?$$","First of all, here are Definitions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 in Baby Rudin, 3rd edition: Definition 6.1: Let $[a, b]$ be a given interval. By a partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ we mean a finite set of points $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n$, where    $$ a = x_0 \leq x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_{n-1} \leq x_n = b.$$   We write    $$ \Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1} \qquad (i = 1, \ldots, n). $$    Now suppose $f$ is a bounded real function defined on $[a, b]$. Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a, b]$ we put   $$ \begin{align}  M_i &= \sup f(x) \qquad (x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i), \\ m_i &= \inf f(x) \qquad (x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i), \\ U(P, f) &= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta x_i, \\ L(P, f) &= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta x_i, \end{align}  $$   and finally    $$  \begin{align} \tag{1} \overline{\int}_a^b f dx &= \inf U(P, f), \\ \tag{2} \underline{\int}_a^b f dx &= \sup L(P, f), \end{align} $$   where the $\inf$ and the $\sup$ are taken over all partitions $P$ of $[a, b]$. The left members of (1) and (2) are called the upper and lower Riemann integrals of $f$ over $[a, b]$, respectively. If the upper and lower integrals are equal, we say that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$, we write $f \in \mathscr{R}$ (that is, $\mathscr{R}$ denotes the set of Riemann-integrable functions), and we denote the common value of (1) and (2) by    $$ \tag{3} \int_a^b f dx, $$   or by    $$ \tag{4} \int_a^b f(x) dx. $$   This is the Riemann integral of $f$ over $[a, b]$. Since $f$ is bounded, there exist two numbers, $m$ and $M$, such that    $$ m \leq f(x) \leq M \qquad (a \leq x \leq b). $$   Hence, for every $P$,    $$ m(b-a) \leq L(P, f) \leq U(P, f) \leq M (b-a), $$   so that the numbers $L(P, f)$ and $U(P, f)$ form a bounded set. This shows that the upper and lower integrals are defined for every bounded function $f$. . . . Definition 6.2: Let $\alpha$ be a monotonically increasing function on $[a, b]$ (since $\alpha(a)$ and $\alpha(b)$ are finite, it follows that $\alpha$ is bounded on $[a, b]$). Corresponding to each partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we write    $$ \Delta \alpha_i = \alpha \left( x_i \right) -  \alpha \left( x_{i-1} \right). $$   It is clear that $\Delta \alpha_i \geq 0$. For any real function $f$ which is bounded on $[a, b]$ we put    $$  \begin{align} U(P, f, \alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \Delta \alpha_i, \\ L(P, f, \alpha) &= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \Delta \alpha_i,  \end{align} $$   where $M_i$, $m_i$ have the same meaning as in Definition 6.1, and we define    $$ \begin{align} \tag{5} \overline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha = \inf U(P, f, \alpha), \\ \tag{6} \underline{\int}_a^b f d \alpha = \sup L(P, f, \alpha),  \end{align} $$   the $\inf$ and $\sup$ again being taken over all partitions. If the left members of (5) and (6) are equal, we denote their common value by    $$ \tag{7} \int_a^b f d \alpha $$   or sometimes by    $$ \tag{8} \int_a^b f(x) d \alpha(x). $$   This is the Riemann-Stieltjes integral (or simply the Stieltjes integral ) of $f$ with respect to $\alpha$, over $[a, b]$. If (7) exists, i.e., if (5) and (6) are equal, we say that $f$ is integrable with respect to $\alpha$, in the Riemann sense, and write $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$. By taking $\alpha(x) = x$, the Riemann integral is seen to be a special case of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. . . . Definition 6.3: We say that the partition $P^*$ is a refinement of [a partition] $P$ if $P^* \supset P$ (that is, if every point of $P$ is also a point of $P^*$). Given two partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$, we say that $P^*$ is their common refinement if $P^* = P_1 \cup P_2$. Now using this machinery how can we evaluate the integral  $$ \int_0^1 x^2 \ \mathrm{d} x? $$ Next, here are Theorems 6.4, 6.8, and 6.9: Theorem 6.4: If $P^*$ is a refinement of $P$, then    $$ \tag{9} L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) $$   and    $$ \tag{10} U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$ And, so we have  $$ L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$ Theorem 6.6: $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$ if and only if for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ such that    $$ U(P, f, \alpha ) - L( P, f, \alpha ) < \varepsilon. $$ Theorem 6.8: If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$ on $[a, b]$. Theorem 6.9: If $f$ is monotonic on $[a, b]$ and $\alpha$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $f \in \mathscr{R}(\alpha)$. (We still assume, of course, that $\alpha$ is monotonic.) The function $f(x) = x^2$ is of course continuous as well as monotonic on the interval $[0, 1]$. Thus by either Theorem 6.8 or Theorem 6.9, our integral exists of course. My Attempt: Let $$P = \left\{ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n \right\}, $$   where    $$ 0 = x_0 < x_1 < \ldots < x_{n-1} < x_n, $$   be a partition of $[0, 1]$. Then as our function $f$ is sttictly increasing on $[0, 1]$, so we find that, for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we have    $$ m_i = f \left( x_{i-1} \right) = x_{i-1}^2 \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad M_i = f \left( x_i \right) = x_i^2. $$   [Refer to Definition 6.1 above for notation.]  Therefore   $$ L(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i-1}^2 \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right) \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad U(P, f) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}^2 \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right).  $$ Now from these two formulas, can we compute the quantities in (1) and (2) in Definition 6.1 above? I have no idea of how we can. However, we can do the following trick: Let us put    $$ h \colon= \min \left\{ \ \Delta x_1, \ldots, \Delta x_n \ \right\}. $$   Then of course this $h$ satisfies    $$ 0 < h \leq 1, $$   from which we obtain    $$ \frac{1}{h} \geq 1. $$   Now let us put   $$ k = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{h} \right\rfloor + 1. $$   This $k$ is of course a natural number, and  we also have the inequality   $$ k-1 \leq \frac{1}{h} < k.$$   Now let $P^\prime$ be the partition of $[0, 1]$ given by   $$ P^\prime \colon= \left\{ \ 0, \frac{1}{k}, \ldots, \frac{k-1}{k}, 1 \ \right\}, $$   and let    $$ P^* \colon= P \cup P^\prime. $$   Then by Theorem 6.4  in Baby Rudin, we have the following two sets of inequalities:   $$ L(P, f, \alpha) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U( P, f, \alpha). $$   And,    $$ L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) \leq L \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U \left( P^*, f, \alpha \right) \leq U\left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right). $$ Now for the partition $P^\prime$, we compute    $$ L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0 }^{n-1} \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 = \frac{ (k-1) (2k-1 ) }{6k^2} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) \left( 2 - \frac{1}{k} \right), $$   and    $$ U \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right) =  \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1 }^n \left( \frac{i}{k} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{k^3} \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{ (k+1) (2k + 1 ) }{6k^2} = \frac{1}{6} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{k} \right) \left( 2 + \frac{1}{k} \right). $$   And, the supremum of all the lower sums $L \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right)$ and the infimum of all the upper sums $U \left( P^\prime, f, \alpha \right)$ obtained in this manner each equals $1/3$.
