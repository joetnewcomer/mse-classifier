0,Normal closure is minimal normal subgroup,Normal closure is minimal normal subgroup,,"The following problem is from the book ""Finite Group Theory"" by Martin Isaacs. (2.A.7) Let $S \lhd \lhd G$ (S is subnormal in G), where $S$ is nonabelian and simple and $G$ is finite. Show that $S^{G}$ , the normal closure of $G$ is minimal normal subgroup in $G$ HINT : Work by induction on $|G|$ to conclude that $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(H)$ whenever $S \subseteq H$ . Deduce that each conjugate of $S$ in $G$ is a minimal normal subgroup of $S^{G}$ . Then apply the previous problem to the group $S^{G}$ , where $X$ is the set of all $G$ -conjugates of S. I've been strugling with the first part of the hint. I tried to prove the claim, as said by author, but I have troubles with the inductive step. For $|G| = 1$ the claim is obviously true. Now assume it holds for any $H$ , s.t. $|H| < |G|$ . Now if $S = G$ , then the claim follows from the simplicity of $S$ . If $S < G$ then for any proper subgroup $H$ of $G$ , s.t. $S \le H$ we have $S = S \cap H \lhd \lhd G \cap H = H$ , so by the inductive hypothesis $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(H)$ But I can't do the inductive step, i.e. $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ . We know that $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) \unlhd S$ , so from the simplicity of $S$ we have that $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) = \{e\}$ or $S \cap \text{Soc}(G) = S$ . It's easy to deal with the second case, as it immediately follows that $S \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ . But I can't do anything about the first case. It seems that we need to use the fact that $S$ is nonabelian, as if $S$ is a noncentral involution in $G=D_8$ we get that $S$ is subnormal in $G$ and simple, but $S \not \subseteq \text{Soc}(G) = Z(G)$ . The only way I can see how to use the fact that $S$ is nonabelian is by proving that $S$ is contained in a center of a subgroup and hence derive a contradiction, but I couldn't achieve any progress in this direction. Also I don't see how we can use the inductive hypothesis for this part, as $\text{Soc}(H) \subseteq \text{Soc}(G)$ is not necessarily true in general. Much of the problem seems to revolve around the mentioned previous problem, which I have proven. The claim is that if $X$ is a collection of minimal normal subgroups of $G$ , then $N = \Pi \ X$ is a direct product of some members of $X$ and moreover a direct product of simple groups. Further more it says that any normal and nonabelian subgroup of $G$ contained in $N$ contains a member of $X$ . Unfortunately I don't see how we can use this problem until the last stage of the proof.","The following problem is from the book ""Finite Group Theory"" by Martin Isaacs.

1,Question in proof about subgroups of cyclic groups,Question in proof about subgroups of cyclic groups,,"I'm studying the proof of the theorem that says: A subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic The proof goes as follows. Let $G = \langle g \rangle$ be a cyclic group. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. For $H = \{e\}$, the statement is trivial. So suppose $H \neq \{e\}$ en let $g^k \in H$ with $k$ minimal in $\mathbb{N_0}$ (so $k$ is the first non zero natural number such that $g^k \in H$). We now show that $H = \langle g^k \rangle$, from which the result follows. Let $g^n \in H$. Write $n = qk+r$ with $0 \leq r <k$. Then, $g^r = g^{n-qk} = g^n(g^k)^{-q} \in H$, from which must follow that $r = 0$ (because we took $k$ minimal and $r < k$). So $g^n \in \langle g^k \rangle$, hence $H = \langle g^k \rangle$. Now, I'm wondering why the proof doesn't work if $H = \{e\}$ if I would not treat the case $H = \{e\}$ separately. I think it is because the proof would fail if $G$ is generated by an element of infinite order, so we cannot take $g^k \in H$ with $k$ minimal. Can someone verify whether this is correct?

I want to know if my reasoning is correct in each case. For me, $A$ is always a commutative ring with $1 \ne 0$. In the first answer this proposition was given: Let $f_1,\dots,f_t\in A[X]$ be nonzero. If there is $0 \ne g\in A[X]$ such that $gf_1=\cdots=gf_t=0$, then there is $0 \ne a\in A$ such that $af_1=\cdots=af_t=0$. Assuming the case $t = 1$ which is McCoy's theorem, I think I can prove this as follows: Proof: Let $\displaystyle F := \sum_{i=1}^t f_i X^{\sum_{j < i} (1 + \deg f_j)}$. Then $gf_1 = \ldots = gf_t = 0 \implies gF = 0 \implies aF = 0$ for some $0 \ne a \in A \implies af_1 = \ldots = af_t = 0$.

So my second question is: Question 2: Is (*) true? If not, what is a counterexample?

We will try to show that $p(x)$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. suppose $p(x)=r(x)q(x)$. If $p(X)$ is not irreducible, none of $r$ and $q$ has degree $0$. None can have degree $1$ since none of the roots is in $\mathbb{Q}$. So we are left with the case when each has degree 2. Suppose $r(x)=x^2+ax+b$.

33,Determining the presentation matrix for a module,Determining the presentation matrix for a module,,"I am trying to study some module theory using the book ""Algebra"" by Michael Artin (2nd Edition, to be precise), and I can't really fathom what is written in Section 14.5. Left multiplication by an $m \times n$ matrix defines a homomorphism   of $R$-modules $A: R^n \rightarrow R^m$. Its image consists of all   linear combinations of the columns of $A$ with coefficients in the   ring, and we may denote the image by $AR^n$. We say that the quotient   module $V=R^m/AR^n$ is presented by the matrix $A$. More generally,   we call any isomorphism $\sigma: R^m/AR^n \rightarrow V$ a presentation of a module $V$, and we say that the matrix $A$ is a presentation matrix for $V$ if there is such an isomorphism. For example, the cyclic group $C_5$ of order $5$ is presented as a   $\mathbb{Z}-$module by the $1\times 1$ integer matrix $[5]$, because   $C_5$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$. The above two paragraphs seem to be clear. We use the canonical map $\pi: R^m \rightarrow V=R^m/AR^n$ to   interpret the quotient module $V=R^m/AR^n$, as follows: Proposition 14.5.1 (a) $V$ is generated by a set of elements B $=(v_1, \cdots, v_m)$, the images of the standard basis elements of $R^m$. (b) If $Y=(y_1, \cdots, y_m)^t$ is a column vector in $R^m$, the element B $Y=v_1y_1+\cdots + v_my_m$ of $V$ is zero if and only if   $Y$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$, with coefficients   in $R$ - if and only if there exists a column vector $X$ with entries   in $R$ such that $Y=AX$. Proof . The images of the standard basis generate $V$ because the map $\pi$ is surjective. Its kernel is the submodule $AR^n$. This   submodule consists precisely of the linear combinations of the columns   of $A$. First, could you expound on the proof please? The proposition is obvious when applied to the above example with $R^m=R^n=\mathbb{Z}$, $V=C_5$, and $A=[5]$; but it doesn't help me to carry out more detailed proof. If a module $V$ is generated by a set B $=(v_1, \cdots, v_m)$, we   call an element $Y$ of $R^m$ such that B $Y=0$ a relation   vector , or simply a relation among the generators. We may also   refer to the equation $v_1y_1+\cdots+v_my_m=0$ as a relation, meaning   that the left side yields $0$ when it is evaluated in $V$. A set $S$   of relations is a complete set if every relation is a linear   combination of $S$ with coefficients in the ring. Example 14.5.2 The $\mathbb{Z}-$module or an abelian group $V$ that is generated by three elements $v_1, v_2, v_3$ with the compete   set of relations $$ 3v_1+2v_2+v_3=0\\ 8v_1+4v_2+2v_3=0\\ 7v_1+6v_2+2v_3=0\\  9v_1+6v_2+v_3=0 $$ is presented by the matrix $$          A=\begin{bmatrix}          3 & 8 & 7 & 9 \\          2 & 4 & 6 & 6 \\          1 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\           \end{bmatrix}. $$ Its columns are the coefficients of the (above) relations: $(v_1, v_2,  v_3)A=(0, 0, 0, 0)$. Here comes the second question. How did he find out immediately what matrix presents the group $V$? Artin gives an algorithm for determining the presentation matrix below this example, but since this example precedes it, the reader should be able to determine this matrix without the algorithm.

In this case, we write $X \sim Y$ . An action is said to be transitive if it has only one orbit. Given an action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ , the stabilizer , $G_x$ , of $x$ is defined by $$ G_x = \{ g \in G : gx = x \}; $$ and the orbit , $Gx$ , of $x$ is defined by $$ Gx = \{ gx : g \in G \}. $$ Properties: (i) $Gx \subset X$ and $G_x \le G$ ; (ii) there exists a bijection from $Gx$ to the coset space $G/G_x$ ; and (iii) if $G$ is finite, then $|Gx|=|G/G_x|$ . The Statement of the Problem: Prove the following: (a) For each subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ , the action $G$ by left translation on the left coset space $G/H$ is transitive.

But knowing that the answer is ""yes"" for groups makes me less confident.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'modules', 'noncommutative-algebra']"
