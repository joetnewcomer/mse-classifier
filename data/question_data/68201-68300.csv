4,Differential forms on fuzzy manifolds,Differential forms on fuzzy manifolds,,"This post will take a bit to set up properly, but it is an easy read (and most likely easy to answer); in any event, please bear with me. Question In the usual setting of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, differential forms are defined as follows: Definition 1 - Given an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a smooth differential $p$-form on $U$ is a smooth function $\omega : U \mapsto \bigwedge^p(\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ such that $\omega = \sum_I{f_Ie_{i_1}^* \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}^*}$ for the smooth function $f_I$ on $U$ and the dual basis $\{e_{1}^*,\ldots,e_{n}^*\}$ of the basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ where $I = \{i_1,\ldots,i_p\} \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $i_1 < \cdots < i_p$.  The vector space of all $p$-forms on $U$ is denoted $\Omega^p(U)$.  The vector space $\Omega^*(U) = \bigoplus_{p \geq 0}{\Omega^p(U)}$ is the set of all differential forms on $U$. which can be lifted up to differential manifolds Definition 2 - Let $M$ be a smooth manifold.  The set $\Omega^p(M)$ of smooth differential $p$-forms on $M$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge^pT^*M$ and the set $\Omega^*(M)$ of all smooth differential forms on $M$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge T^*M$. Definition 2 is all well and good when one is dealing with ""standard"" differential manifolds $M$, i.e., $M$ is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, is it possible to define differential forms, along with other related concepts, on manifolds that are not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but rather homeomorphic to a more abstract topological vector space?  More specifically, can this be done on fuzzy topological vector spaces (see the background section/papers below for clarification) and hence on fuzzy differential manifolds?  If so, how? ""Answer"" My intuition is that differential forms can be defined for fuzzy differential manifolds and hence fuzzy topological vector spaces.  In fact, it looks like it, along with the supporting notions of sections, fiber bundles, and alternating multilinear maps, can be defined without explicitly worrying much about the ""fuzzy baggage"" associated with fuzzy manifolds/fuzzy spaces. Definition 3 - Let $X$ be a differentiable fuzzy manifold (see definition 17 below), $TX = \bigsqcup_{x\in X}T_xX$ the associated tangent bundle (see definition 18 below for the tangent space), and $T^*X$ the dual bundle to $TX$.  The set $\Omega^p(X)$ of smooth differential $p$-forms on $X$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge^pT^*X$. The same appears to be true for the local representation of a $p$-form Definition 4 - Let $X$ be a differentiable fuzzy manifold $(A,\phi)$ and fuzzy chart of $X$ at $x$ (see definition 16 below), where $x$ lies in the support of the fuzzy set $A$.  A $p$-form $\omega$ can be expressed in terms of its coordinate functions with respect to the basis $\{e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}\}$ of $T^*X$, $i_1 < \cdots < i_p$, as $\omega = \sum_I{f_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}e_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}}$, where $f_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}$ is a function on $A$. Background In the paper ""$C^1$ fuzzy manifolds"", Fuzzy Sets and Systems , vol. 54, pp. 99-106, 1993 (PDF link) , Ferraro and Foster introduced one possible realization of a ""fuzzy"" manifold: a differentiable manifold that is locally homeomorphic to open fuzzy sets living in a certain kind of fuzzy topological vector space.  More formally, Fuzzy Topological Space Definition 5 - Let $X$ be a set and $I$ the unit interval $[0,1]$.  A fuzzy set $A$ is characterized by a membership function $\mu_A$ which associates each point $x \in X$ with a membership grade $\mu_A(x) \in I$. Definition 6 - Let $k_c$ be the fuzzy set in $X$ with the membership function $\mu_{k_c}(x) = c$, $c \in I$, $x \in X$.  The fuzzy set $k_1$ corresponds to the set $X$ and the fuzzy set $k_0$ to the empty set. Definition 7 - Let $X$ be a set.  A fuzzy topology on $X$ is a family $\mathscr{F}$ of fuzzy sets in $X$ which satisfy the following conditions: (i) $k_0,k_1 \in \mathscr{F}$, (ii) if $A,B \in \mathscr{F}$ then $A \cap B \in \mathscr{F}$, (iii) if $A_j \in \mathscr{F}$ then $\bigcup_j{A_j} = \sup_j \mu_{A_j}(x) \in \mathscr{F}$, for finite $j$ and $x \in X$; we call $(X,\mathscr{F})$ a fuzzy topological space. Definition 8 - An open fuzzy set $A \in X$ is one in $\mathscr{F}$.  A closed fuzzy set is one whose compliment, i.e., $\mu_{A^c}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)$, $\forall x \in X$, is in $\mathscr{F}$. Fuzzy Topological Vector Space Definition 9 - A fuzzy point in $X$ is a fuzzy set with membership function $\mu_{y_\lambda}(x)$, $x \in X$, such that $\mu_{y_\lambda}(x) = \lambda$ for $x = y$ and $0$ otherwise. Definition 10 - Let $(X_1,\mathscr{F}_1)$ and $(X_2,\mathscr{F}_2)$ be two fuzzy topological spaces.  A mapping $f$ of $(X_1,\mathscr{F}_1)$ onto $(X_2,\mathscr{F}_2)$ is said to be fuzzy continuous if for each open fuzzy set $B \in \mathscr{F}_2$ the inverse image $f^{-1}(B)$ is in $\mathscr{F}_1$.  Conversely, $f$ is fuzzy open if for each $A \in \mathscr{F}_1$ the image $f(A)$ is in $\mathscr{F}_2$.  If $f$ is a bijective mapping that is both fuzzy continuous and fuzzy open, it is called a fuzzy homeomorphism. Definition 11 - Let $\{A_j\}$ be a finite family of fuzzy sets in a vector space $E$ over the field $K$ of real numbers.  The sum $A = \sum_j A_j$ of the family $\{A_j\}$ is the fuzzy set in $E$ that has membership function $\mu_A(x) = \sup_{\sum_j A_j}\min_j \mu_{A_j}(x_j)$, $x \in E$.  The scalar product $\alpha A$ of $\alpha \in K$ and $A \in E$ is the fuzzy set in $E$ with membership function $\mu_{\alpha A}(x)$, $x \in E$, given by: $\mu_{\alpha A}(x) = \mu_{A}(x/\alpha)$ for $\alpha \neq 0$ and $\mu_{\alpha A}(x) = \mu_{0_\lambda}(x)$ for $\alpha = 0$ where $0_\lambda$ is a fuzzy point at $0$ in $E$ with $\lambda = \sup_{y \in E}\mu_A(y)$. Definition 12 - A fuzzy topological vector space is a vector space $E$ over the field $K$ of real numbers, $E$ equipped with the fuzzy topology $\mathscr{F}$ and $K$ with the usual topology $\mathscr{H}$, such that the two mappings: (i) $(x,y) \mapsto x+y$ of $(E,\mathscr{F}) \times (E,\mathscr{F})$ into $(E,\mathscr{F})$ and (ii) $(\alpha,x) \mapsto \alpha x$ of $(K,\mathscr{H}) \times (E,\mathscr{F})$ into $(E,\mathscr{F})$ are fuzzy continuous. Fuzzy Manifold and Tangent Space Definition 13 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces.  Let $o(t)$ denote a function of a real variable $t$ such that $\lim_{t\to 0}o(t)/t = 0$.  A mapping $\beta$ is said to be tangent to 0 if given a neighborhood $W$ of $0_\delta$ (a fuzzy point), $0 < \delta \leq 1$, in $\mathscr{E}_1$ there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $0_\lambda$ (a fuzzy point), for every $\lambda$, $0 < \lambda < \delta$, in $\mathscr{E}_2$ such that $\beta(tV) \subset o(t)W$. Definition 14 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces endowed with a $T_1$ fuzzy topology (a $T_1$ fuzzy topological space is one where every fuzzy point is a closed fuzzy set).  Let $f : \mathscr{E}_1 \mapsto \mathscr{E}_2$ be a fuzzy continuous mapping.  $f$ is said to be fuzzy differentiable at a point $x \in \mathscr{E}_1$ if there exists a linear fuzzy continuous mapping $u$ of $\mathscr{E}_1$ into $\mathscr{E}_2$ such that $f(x+y) = f(x)+u(y)+\beta(y)$, $y \in \mathscr{E}_1$ where $\beta$ is tangent to $0$.  The mapping $u$ is called the fuzzy derivative $f$ at $x$ and $f$ is called fuzzy differentiable if it is fuzzy differentiable at every point of $\mathscr{E}_1$. Comment 1 - One can also define the fuzzy partial derivative in a manner analogous to Lang in $\S I.3$ of: S. Lang, Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds, New York City, NY, USA: Springer, 2002; a definition of fuzzy integration also follows from $\S I.4$, ibid. Definition 15 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces.  A bijection $f$ of $\mathscr{E}_1$ into $\mathscr{E}_2$ is said to be a fuzzy diffeomorphism of class $C^1$ if it and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are fuzzy differentiable and $f'$ and $(f^{-1})'$ are fuzzy continuous. Definition 16 - Let $X$ be a set.  A fuzzy atlas of class $C^1$ on $X$ is a collection of pairs $(A_j,\phi_j)$ which satisfies the following conditions: (i) each $A_j$ is a fuzzy set on $X$ and $\sup_j \mu_{A_j}(x)$, $\forall x \in X$ (ii) each $\phi_j$ is a bijection defined on the support of $A_j$, i.e.,  $\{x \in X,\mu_{A_j}(x) > 0\}$, that maps $A_j$ onto an open fuzzy set $\phi_j(A_j)$ in some fuzzy vector space $\mathscr{E}_j$ and for each $l$ in the index set $\phi_j(A_j \cap A_l)$ is an open fuzzy set $\mathscr{E}_j$ (iii) the mapping $\phi_l \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ which maps $\phi_j(A_j \cap A_l)$ onto $\phi_l(A_j \cap A_l)$ is a $C^1$ fuzzy diffeomorphism for each pair of indices $j,l$. Definition 17 - Let $(X,\mathscr{F})$ be a fuzzy topological space.  Suppose there exists an open fuzzy set $A$ on $X$ and a fuzzy continuous mapping $\phi$ defined on the support of $A$, mapping $A$ onto an open fuzzy set $V$ in a fuzzy topological vector space $\mathscr{E}$.  $(A,\phi)$ is said to be compatible with the fuzzy atlas $\{(A_j,\phi_j)\}$ if each mapping $\phi_j \circ \phi^{-1}$ of $\phi(A \cap A_j)$ into $\phi_j(A \cap A_j)$ is a fuzzy diffeomorphism of class $C^1$.  Two fuzzy $C^1$ atlases are compatible if each fuzzy chart in one atlas is compatible with each fuzzy chart of another atlas; this relation of compatibility between $C^1$ fuzzy atlases is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of $C^1$ fuzzy atlases on $X$ is said to define a $C^1$ fuzzy manifold on $X$. Comment 2 - As an aside, it appears one can modify Hirsch's arguments in Lemma 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 (M. W. Hirsch, Differential Topology, New York City, NY, USA: Springer, 1976) to show that every $C^1$ fuzzy manifold is $C^1$ fuzzy diffeomorphic to a $C^\infty$ fuzzy manifold. Definition 18 - Let $X$ be a fuzzy manifold.  Consider the triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ and $(A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$; here $(A_1,\phi_1)$ is a fuzzy chart at $x$ in $X$ with $v_\lambda$ being a fuzzy point of the fuzzy vector space in which $\phi(A_1)$ lies and $(A_2,\phi_2)$ and $w_\lambda$ are defined similarly.  These pair of triples are related, denoted by $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$, if the fuzzy derivative of $\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1}$ maps $v_\lambda$ into $w_\lambda$, i.e., $(\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1})'(\phi_1(x))v_\lambda = w_\lambda$; this relation $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$ is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ is called a tangent vector of the fuzzy manifold $X$ at $x$ and the tangent space $T_x(X)$ at $x$ is the set of all tangent vectors at $x$. Comment 3 - As usual, $T_x(X)$ can be given the structure of a vector space. For further discussion about the above terms, e.g., fuzzy derivatives, it is advisable to consult: M. Ferraro and D. Foster ""Differentiation of fuzzy continuous mappings on fuzzy topological vector spaces"", Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications , vol. 121, pp. 589-601, 1987 (PDF link) .","This post will take a bit to set up properly, but it is an easy read (and most likely easy to answer); in any event, please bear with me.

Suppose there exists an open fuzzy set $A$ on $X$ and a fuzzy continuous mapping $\phi$ defined on the support of $A$, mapping $A$ onto an open fuzzy set $V$ in a fuzzy topological vector space $\mathscr{E}$.  $(A,\phi)$ is said to be compatible with the fuzzy atlas $\{(A_j,\phi_j)\}$ if each mapping $\phi_j \circ \phi^{-1}$ of $\phi(A \cap A_j)$ into $\phi_j(A \cap A_j)$ is a fuzzy diffeomorphism of class $C^1$.  Two fuzzy $C^1$ atlases are compatible if each fuzzy chart in one atlas is compatible with each fuzzy chart of another atlas; this relation of compatibility between $C^1$ fuzzy atlases is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of $C^1$ fuzzy atlases on $X$ is said to define a $C^1$ fuzzy manifold on $X$. Comment 2 - As an aside, it appears one can modify Hirsch's arguments in Lemma 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 (M. W. Hirsch, Differential Topology, New York City, NY, USA: Springer, 1976) to show that every $C^1$ fuzzy manifold is $C^1$ fuzzy diffeomorphic to a $C^\infty$ fuzzy manifold. Definition 18 - Let $X$ be a fuzzy manifold.  Consider the triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ and $(A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$; here $(A_1,\phi_1)$ is a fuzzy chart at $x$ in $X$ with $v_\lambda$ being a fuzzy point of the fuzzy vector space in which $\phi(A_1)$ lies and $(A_2,\phi_2)$ and $w_\lambda$ are defined similarly.  These pair of triples are related, denoted by $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$, if the fuzzy derivative of $\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1}$ maps $v_\lambda$ into $w_\lambda$, i.e., $(\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1})'(\phi_1(x))v_\lambda = w_\lambda$; this relation $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$ is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ is called a tangent vector of the fuzzy manifold $X$ at $x$ and the tangent space $T_x(X)$ at $x$ is the set of all tangent vectors at $x$. Comment 3 - As usual, $T_x(X)$ can be given the structure of a vector space. For further discussion about the above terms, e.g., fuzzy derivatives, it is advisable to consult: M. Ferraro and D.

14,Are commutative C*-algebras really dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces?,Are commutative C*-algebras really dual to locally compact Hausdorff spaces?,,"Several online sources (e.g. Wikipedia , the nLab ) assert that the Gelfand representation defines a contravariant equivalence from the category of (non-unital) commutative $C^{\ast}$-algebras to the category of locally compact Hausdorff (LCH) spaces. This seems wrong to me. The naive choice is to take all continuous maps between LCH spaces. This doesn't work. For example, the constant map $\mathbb{R} \to \bullet$ does not come from a morphism $\mathbb{C} \to C_0(\mathbb{R})$, the problem being that composing with the map $\bullet \to \mathbb{C}$ sending $\bullet$ to $1$ gives a function on $\mathbb{R}$ which doesn't vanish at infinity.

28,Is there anyone among us who can identify a certain SUS space?,Is there anyone among us who can identify a certain SUS space?,,"The property US (""Unique Sequential limits"") is a classic example of property implied by $T_2$ and implying $T_1$ . In fact, it's the weakest assumption out of a chain of several distinct properties studied in the literature: $T_2$ $k_1$ -Hausdorff KC Weakly Hausdorff $k_2$ -Hausdorff (or $k_2H$ ) US $T_1$ During a recent meeting of the Carolinas topology seminar, some comments of Alan Dow got me to thinking about another intermediate property. We say that a long sequence is a continuous function $f:\kappa\to X$ for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$ , and it has a limit $x\in X$ provided for every neighborhood of $x$ , the neighborhood contains $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]$ for some $\alpha<\kappa$ . Then let's call a space SUS (""strongly US"") if whenever a long sequence has a limit, this limit is unique. It's immediate that all SUS spaces are US. Furthermore, every $k_2H$ space $X$ is SUS: let $x,y$ be limits of a sequence $f:\kappa\to X$ . Then consider the compact Hausdorff space $K=(\kappa+1)\times\{0,1\}$ and the continuous function $g:K\to X$ defined by $g(\alpha,i)=f(\alpha)$ , $g(\kappa,0)=x$ , and $g(\kappa,1)=y$ . Note that there do not exist open neighborhoods $U,V$ of $(\kappa,0),(\kappa,1)$ with $f[U],f[V]$ disjoint, so it follows that $f(\kappa,0)=f(\kappa,1)$ and $x=y$ . The standard example of a US-not- $k_2H$ space is $\omega_1+1$ with the endpoint doubled : it's US as only trivial $\omega$ -length sequences converge to $\omega_1$ , but it fails to be SUS as the identity on $\omega_1$ is a long sequence with two distinct limits at the doubled endpoint. So, is it possible to construct a SUS space that's not $k_2H$ ? Let's call such a space an imposter . EMERGENCY MEETING: This space seems pretty SUS: $X=[0,1]\cup\{\infty\}$ where points of $[0,1]$ have their usual neighborhoods, and neighborhoods of $\infty$ must contain an open dense subset of $[0,1]$ . Of course its open subspace $[0,1]$ is definitely SUS: it's metrizable and thus Hausdorff. So it's sufficient to show that if $x\in[0,1]$ is a limit of a long sequence, $\infty$ is not a limit of that sequence. Let $x\in[0,1]$ be the limit of a long sequence given by $f:\kappa\to X$ . Then for each $n<\omega$ , there exists $\alpha_n<\kappa$ such that $B(x,1/2^n)$ contains $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha_n]$ . Suppose $\sup_{n<\omega}\alpha_n=\alpha<\kappa$ . Then $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]=\{x\}$ , and $X\setminus\{x\}$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ missing $f[\kappa\setminus\alpha]$ . Suppose $\sup_{n<\omega}\alpha_n=\kappa$ . Then $f\upharpoonright\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a countable sequence converging to $x$ in $[0,1]$ . Then $\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a nowhere dense subset of $[0,1]$ , so $X\setminus\{\alpha_n:n<\omega\}$ is a neighborhood of $\infty$ that fails to contain a final subsequence of $f$ . However, while I can tell that this space is not weakly Hausdorff (it contains a non-closed copy of the compact Hausdorff space $[0,1]$ ), it's not clear to me whether or not it is $k_2H$ (and therefore whether or not it is an imposter). Update: This space is not an imposter. Whoops. Here's why it's $k_2H$ . Let $K$ be compact Hausdorff, let $f:K\to X$ be continuous, and let $f(l)\not=f(k)$ . To check the $k_2H$ criterion, we need only consider the case where $f(l)=\infty$ as pairs of points in $[0,1]$ are separated by open sets in $X$ . Let $V$ be an open neighborhood of $l$ whose closure is contained in $f^\leftarrow[X\setminus\{f(k)\}]$ ; in particular, so $f(k)\not\in f[cl(V)]$ . It follows that $cl(V)$ is compact and thus $f[cl(V)]$ is compact. We claim it is closed in $X$ , so let $x$ be a limit point. If $x=\infty$ , $x=f(l)$ and we're done. Otherwise, pick $x_n\in B(x,1/2^n)\cap f[cl(V)]$ for each $n<\omega$ . Then the open collection $\{X\setminus\{x_n:N\leq n<\omega\}:n<\omega\}$ covers $X\setminus\{x\}$ but has no finite subcover for $\{x_n:n<\omega\}$ . It follows it cannot be a cover of $f[cl(V)]$ , showing $x\in f[cl(V)]$ . Since $f(k)\not\in f[cl(V)]$ , let $U=f^\leftarrow[X\setminus f[cl(V)]]$ . We have now obtained open neighborhoods $U,V$ for $k,l$ such that $f[U]\cap f[V]\subseteq (X\setminus f[cl(V)])\cap f[cl(V)]=\emptyset$ . Sidenote: after presenting related work to the Pitt topology seminar earlier today, Paul Gartside pointed out that perhaps a more natural definition for a ""strong US"" property would involve something like continuous functions from arbitrary Hausdorff spaces, rather than ordinals, and then consider unique limits (where a limit must have neighborhoods with co-compact intersection with the image). If we called this SUS', then we'd have $k_2H$ implies SUS' implies SUS.

In other words, what did I gain by adding the subsets $\{c\}$ and $\{b\}$ to $\tau_2$? More over what can I do with $\tau_2$ I can't do with $\tau_1$?",,['general-topology']

But if we remove two arbitrary points $p$ and $q$ , the resulting $S^1 \setminus \{p,q\}$ is disconnected. Let $X$ be a topological space. Let's call $X$ to be $n$ -flimsy if removing fewer then $n$ arbitrary points leaves the space connected and removing any $n$ arbitrary (distinct) points disconnects the space.

69,Why is the Hilbert Cube homogeneous?,Why is the Hilbert Cube homogeneous?,,"The Hilbert Cube $H$ is defined to be $[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$, i.e., a countable product of unit intervals, topologized with the product topology. Now, I've read that the Hilbert Cube is homogeneous.  That is, given two points $p, q\in H$, there is a homeomorphism $f:H\rightarrow H$ with $f(p)=q$. What's confusing to me is that it seems like there seems to be a stratification of points.  That is, there are Points contained in $(0,1)^{\mathbb{N}}$ Points which have precisely $n$ coordinate a $0$ or $1$ for n a fixed natural number. Point which have countably many coordinates equaling $0$ or $1$ and countably many not and Points which have n many coordinates NOT equal to $0$ or $1$. Now, for fixed $p$ and $q$ both in class $1$ or $3$ (or fix an n and use class $2$ or $4$), it's clear to me that there is a homeomorphism taking $p$ to $q$, simply by swapping around factors and using the fact that $(0,1)$ is clearly homogeneous. But what are the homeomorphisms which mix the classes?  In particular, what homemorphism takes $(0,0,0,\ldots )$ to $(1/2, 1/2,1/2,\ldots )$? Said another way, for any natural number $n>1$, $[0,1]^n$ is NOT homogeneous, precisely because of these boundary points.

Edit In the off chance that someone stumbles across this question, I just wanted to provide a rough idea of the answer, as garnered from the link Pete provided in his answer. If one has a point of the form $(1,p)$ in $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, then there is a self homeomorphism of $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ taking $(1,p)$ to $(q,1)$ with $q\neq 0, 1$.  For example, one can use a ""square rotation"".  From here, the idea is simple:  given a point in $H$ of the form $(1, p_2, p_3, p_4,\ldots )$, apply the square rotation on the first two factors to get a new point of the form $(q_1, 1, p_2, p_3,\ldots )$.  Now, apply the square rotation on the second two factors to get a new point of the form $(q_1, q_2, 1, p_3,\ldots )$.  The point is that after $k$ iterations, the first $k$ coordinates are all in the interior. Now one proves a techinical lemma that states that the infinite composition of these homeomorphisms is a well defined homeomorphism.  The infinite composition maps the point $(1, p_2, \ldots )$ to a point of the form $(q_1, q_2,\ldots )$ which lies on the ""interior"" of $H$.

Then $d(\phi_1,\phi_2)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{-n}|\phi_1(x_n)-\phi_2(x_n)|$ is a metric which induces the weak*-topology of $\mathcal{B}^*$. I was wondering about the converse: Question 1 . Suppose that the weak*-topology of $\mathcal{B}^*$ is metrizable. Is $X$ (norm-)separable? My thought was: By Banach-Alaoglu $\mathcal{B}^*$ is weak*-compact. If it is also metrizable, then it is (weak*-)separable, and it follows easily that $X^*=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty\mathcal{B}^*$ is also weak*-separable. The problem is that this does not imply that $X$ is separable ($\ell_\infty$ is a counterexample - weak$^*$-separability of $l_\infty^*$. ) My second idea was to try to compare a metric which induces the weak*-topology of $\mathcal{B}^*$ with some metric as in the proof of the theorem above, but I did not succeed.

94,Homeomorphic to the disk implies existence of fixed point common to all isometries?,Homeomorphic to the disk implies existence of fixed point common to all isometries?,,"A fellow grad student was working on this seemingly simple problem which appears to have us both stuck. (The problem naturally came up in his work so isn't from the literature as far as we know). Let $M$ be a metric space homeomorphic to the closed unit disk $D^n\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We call such a metric space an $n$-cell . Let $\mbox{Isom}(M)$ be the group of bijective isometries $M\rightarrow M$. If $M$ is an $n$-cell, does there exist a point $p\in M$ such that $\varphi(p)=p$ for all $\varphi\in \mbox{Isom}(M)$? Clearly such a $p$ need not be unique. So far, the best attempt has been to consider a set which is invariant under isometries, as follows. Let $\partial M$ be the boundary of $M$ and define a function $f\colon M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=\sup_{y\in\partial M}\{d(x,y)\}$ which is continuous, and as $M$ is compact must attain its minimum say $m$. Then, let $$A=\{p\in M\mid f(p)=m\}.$$ That is, $A$ is the (non-empty) set of points in $M$ which minimise the maximum distance to the boundary of $M$. It should be clear that if $\varphi$ is an isometry on $M$, then $\varphi(A)=A$, and one would hope that $A$ is in fact a single point (or at least fixed pointwise instead of just setwise). However, proving this is not clear. There is obviously something else missing here as the topology on the $n$-cell is crucial. For instance an annulus has no such fixed point and the set $A$ would be the inner boundary circle. It's possible the above set up isn't the right way to tackle the problem. It's also possible that there exists a counterexample and there is some $M$ with no fixed point. Any help is appreciated.","A fellow grad student was working on this seemingly simple problem which appears to have us both stuck. (The problem naturally came up in his work so isn't from the literature as far as we know). Let $M$ be a metric space homeomorphic to the closed unit disk $D^n\subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We call such a metric space an $n$-cell . Let $\mbox{Isom}(M)$ be the group of bijective isometries $M\rightarrow M$. If $M$ is an $n$-cell, does there exist a point $p\in M$ such that $\varphi(p)=p$ for all $\varphi\in \mbox{Isom}(M)$? Clearly such a $p$ need not be unique. So far, the best attempt has been to consider a set which is invariant under isometries, as follows. Let $\partial M$ be the boundary of $M$ and define a function $f\colon M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x)=\sup_{y\in\partial M}\{d(x,y)\}$ which is continuous, and as $M$ is compact must attain its minimum say $m$. Then, let $$A=\{p\in M\mid f(p)=m\}.$$ That is, $A$ is the (non-empty) set of points in $M$ which minimise the maximum distance to the boundary of $M$. It should be clear that if $\varphi$ is an isometry on $M$, then $\varphi(A)=A$, and one would hope that $A$ is in fact a single point (or at least fixed pointwise instead of just setwise).
