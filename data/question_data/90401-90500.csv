I was able to prove this direction by myself bounded $\implies$ continuous. $A$ bounded $\iff$ $||Ax|| \leq ||A|| ||x||$ where $||A|| = sup \frac{|Ax|}{||x||}$ for $x \neq 0$ . My thoughts were $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists \delta >0 : ||x - x_0|| \implies ||Ax - Ax_0|| < \epsilon$ . So I have to find the $\delta$ . Thus I used $||Ax - Ax_0|| = ||A(x - x_0)|| \leq ||A|| ||x - x_0|| < ||A|| \delta$ . And now I recalled that I want to find the $\delta$ , so I looked what fits my needs and chose $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{||A||}$ for $||A|| \neq 0$ . Choosing $\epsilon$ and $x_{0}$ arbitrary shows continuity for the case $||A|| \neq 0$ . Now, the case $||A|| = 0$ is trivial.

I've been looking at this problem and studying orthogonal complements and the direct sum theorem for a few days now, to no avail, so I suspect there's something very fundamental I don't understand here.

Proof given by W. Zhan Note that adjoint of a bounded operator always exists by Riesz Represenation Theorem. So we have $$ \langle Tx,x \rangle = \langle x, T^*x \rangle  \ge ||x||^2$$ So $T^*$ is injective. We also have $im T^\perp =  \ker T^*$ . Hence, $im T = H$ . I'm not sure what I'm not understanding. I do understand So $T^*$ is injective. and also We also have $im T^\perp =  \ker T^*$ but not how those two facts yield the conclusion. Here's a couple starts I've had on my own Proof (alternate start 1) Let $Tx = 0$ , then $$0 = \langle Tx, x\rangle \geq \|x\|^2 \geq 0$$ so $\|x \| = 0$ , but by definition of the norm, only if $x = 0$ . So $Tx = 0 \iff x = 0$ , therefore $T$ is injective. This means $T$ has an inverse linear operator $T^{-1}$ . Now, let $y \in \overline{TH}$ . By definition, $y$ is a limit point of $TH$ , so there exists a sequence $(x_n)$ in $H$ such that $(Tx_n) \longrightarrow y$ . However, $x_n = T^{-1}Tx_n$ , which implies $$\lim_{n\to \infty}x_n = \lim_{n\to \infty} T^{-1}Tx_n  = T^{-1}\lim_{n \to \infty}Tx_n = T^{-1}y$$ ... here I think I'm in trouble because I don't know if I can actually show $T^{-1}y$ exits, which I think is equivalent to showint $T^{-1}$ is bounded. Proof (alternate start 2) Here, as W. Zhan pointed out, it's easy to see that $(TH)^\perp = \{0\}$ , which implies that $TH$ is dense in $H$ . In other words, $\overline{TH} = H$ . So all that remains is to show that $TH$ is closed. But this is similar to the argument in my first attempt. Discussion I understand that $T^*$ is injective—because it is a linear operator and $Tx = 0 \implies x = 0$ . In fact $T$ is as well. So I believe another option is to show surjectivity of $T$ , but I can see how to do that.

29,Mean Value Inequality in Banach Space without Hahn-Banach or Integrals,Mean Value Inequality in Banach Space without Hahn-Banach or Integrals,,"If $f : E \to F$ is a continuous map of Banach spaces, with bounded Fréchet derivative. Then $x_0,x_1 \in E\Rightarrow \|f(x_1) − f(x_0)\| ≤ M\|x_1 − x_0\|$ where $M = \sup \|f'(x)\|.$ The most efficient way to prove this, as far as I know, is to apply Hahn-Banach. Alternatively, one starts with $g(t)= f(x_0 + t(x_1 − x_0));\ 0\le t\le 1$ and reduces the problem to the real case. But, of course, the Hahn-Banach theorem is a (relatively) big gun, and to do the integral if one uses $g$ , then integration in Banach spaces must be dealt with (via regulated functions, for example.) The only elementary proof I have seen uses the dot product (Apostol, Rudin), but then of course, one must assume an inner product. Below I sketch a very basic proof, but it required more effort than I expected, so my question is: can one get it cheaper, using only elementary means (very basic facts about normed spaces and the definition of derivative)? Assume for convenience that $x_0=f(x_0)=0$ and consider the segment $\{tx_1:\ 0\le t\le 1\}.$ We have $\|f(x)\|\le M\|x\|+\|r(x)\|\cdot\|x\|$ where $\frac{\|r(x)\|}{\|x\|}\to 0$ as $x\to 0.$ So, if $\epsilon>0,$ we can choose $\delta>0$ such that $t\le \min \left(1,\frac{\delta}{\|x_1\|}\right)\Rightarrow \|f(tx_1)\| ≤ (M + \epsilon)t\|x_1\|$ . To prove the claim, it will suffice to prove that $t=1$ satisfies this last inequality, so to that end, let $\tau=\sup\{r>0:\|f(tx_1)\| ≤ (M + \epsilon)t\|x_1\|\text{for all}\ t\in [0,r]\}$ , so that $\tau\le 1$ and $\tau\in \{r>0:\|f(tx_1)\| ≤ (M + \epsilon)t\|x_1\|\text{for all}\ t\in [0,r]\}$ (because $f$ is continuous.) Now, toward a contradiction, suppose that $\tau<1$ and choose $c>0$ and small enough so that $(\tau+c)x_1$ is on the segment. Now, there is a $\delta' > 0$ such that $\|f(x) − f(\tau x_1)\| \le (M + \epsilon)||x − \tau x_1\|<\epsilon$ whenever $\|x − \tau x_1\| <\delta'.$ So, since $\|(\tau + c)x_1 − \tau x_1\| = c\|x_1\|<\delta' $ if $c$ is small enough, we have, with $x=(\tau + c)x_1$ , $\|f((\tau+c) x_1)-f(\tau x_1)\| \le (M+\epsilon)\|(\tau+c)x_1-\tau x_1\|=(M+\epsilon)\|cx_1\|$ and so finally, $f((\tau+c)x_1)\le (M+\epsilon)\|cx_1\|+\|f(\tau x_1)\|\le $ $(M+\epsilon)\|cx_1\|+ (M+\epsilon)\|\tau x_1\|=(M+\epsilon)(c+\tau)\|x_1\|$ , which contradicts the fact that $\tau$ is a supremum.","If is a continuous map of Banach spaces, with bounded Fréchet derivative.

Claim: $$A\int_S f(s)\,d\mu(s) = \int_S Af(s)\,d\mu(s).$$ Proof: Observe that by the answer to ""Point-wise"" value of Bochner integral of $L^2$ functions , the above is true if $A$ were a bounded linear map $X\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$. Let $\{v_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a Hilbert basis for $Y$ and $p_i$ be the bounded linear functional $\langle\,\cdot\,,v_i\rangle$ for each $i\in I$. Then applying the previous observation to $p_i\circ A:X\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ and $p_i:Y\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ gives $$p_i\circ A\int_S f(s)\,d\mu(s) = \int_S p_i\circ Af(s)\,d\mu(s) = p_i\int_S Af(s)\,d\mu(s)$$ for all $i\in I$. The claim follows by non-degeneracy of the inner product on $Y$.",,"['integration', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'measure-theory', 'hilbert-spaces']"

99,Pointwise convergence in Holder space,Pointwise convergence in Holder space,,"Throughout, we denote $C^\alpha$ for $\alpha \in (0,1]$ is the collection of real functions on the domain $[0,1]$ with Holder continuity of $\alpha$, i.e. if $f\in C^\alpha$, we have its norm  $$|f|_\alpha = \sup_{[0,1]} |f| + \sup_{x\neq y \in [0,1]} \frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x- y|^\alpha}$$  I want to know if the following claim is true, if not, a counter-example is desirable. [Claim 1] Let $|f_n|_\alpha <1$, and $\lim_n f_n(x) = 0$ for all $x\in [0,1]$. Then $f_n\to 0$ in $C^\alpha$. The following weaker result seems correct, please check.
