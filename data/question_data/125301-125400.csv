1,Meaning of Fundamental group of a graph,Meaning of Fundamental group of a graph,,"I am a computer science student working in graph algorithms. I am unable to understand what the fundamental group of a graph means. I have some intuition regarding the fundamental group of a topological space and homotopy equivalence (capturing smooth transformation of closed paths, and ""holes"" in the space). But in the case of a graph, what exactly is the topology (open sets) defined on it to talk about fundamental groups and homotopy? Or am I wrongly mixing up very different notions with the same name? Also, could someone provide elementary references on this with examples? The references I found are all too rigorous with algebraic topology machinery, and unsuitable for big picture intuition and quick learning through examples, which is what I want to start with for now. If that is not possible, do suggest a linear sequence of topics I need to be familiar with so that I can get a working knowledge of fundamental groups of graphs (I noticed mentions of covering spaces, but I digressed with that and am not sure how to proceed). I am interested in its relationship with Cayley graphs and the Ihara zeta function, which I hope to get into once I clear up the fundamentals.

I've been stuck on this exercise for quite some time now, and really can't find a satisfactory solution for this. The section on applications of Sylow theorems in my book is kind of concise, and maybe there is some trivial fact I'm missing. If $G$ is a group of order 60 that has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup, prove that $G$ also has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Attempts: I'll denote the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups by $S_p$ and the given normal Sylow 3-subgroup by $N$. By Sylow Theorems, we know that $|S_5| = 1$ or $6$. In the first case, Sylow 5-subgroup must be normal, so I've tried to assume that $|S_5| = 6$ and somehow derive a contradiction. Since $N$ is normal in $G$, quotient group $G/N$ exists, and must have order 20. Function $f: G \rightarrow G/N$ is then our homomorphism between $G$ and it's quotient group. By inspection and ordinary counting arguments we can see that $|S_5| = 1$ in $G/N$, so there are only four elements (cosets) of order 5 in $G/N$. Assuming that $|S_5| = 6$, then we have 24 elements of order 5 in $G$. Then $f$ should map these to a coset which s order is dividing the order of 5, but that is only 1 or 5. Because index of $N$ in $G$ is 20, we get that there are 3 elements in each coset. Then we would have space for at most 15 elements in the cosets of order 1 or 5 in $G/N$, yet by assumption $G$ has 24 elements of order 5. Am I on the right way? Is there a trivial way to prove this? I've had no bigger problems with other exercises surrounding this one, so I guess there might be a trivial way of proving this. Attempt 2: If $N$ is the normal Sylow 3-subgroup, then $G/N$ exists and we established there exists a normal Sylow 5-subgroup $T$ of $G/N$. By Correspondence theorem $T$ is on the form $H/N$, where $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ containing $N$. Since $|H| = |H/N||N|$, I deduce $|H|=15$. Since $H/N$ is normal, quotient $(G/N)/(H/N)$ exists and is by third isomorphism theorem isomorphic to $G/H$. So if $G/H$ exists, then $H$ must be normal of $G$. We see, since $|H| = 15$, that it contains a single normal Sylow 5-subgroup. Now since the Sylow 5-subgroup I'm looking for is contained in the normal subgroup $H$, the number of Sylow 5-subgroups of $H$ must be same as in $G$ because of the Second Sylow Theorem and normality of $H$. I this the correct solution? edit: Actually I think I've made a mistake in the italic part. $(G/N)/(H/N)$ certainly exists, but does not need to be isomorphic to $G/H$ (?).

49,Composing outer automorphisms with group representations,Composing outer automorphisms with group representations,,"In J.P. Serre's Linear Representations of Finite Groups, two representations $(\rho, V)$ and $(\rho', V')$ of a finite group $G$ are called isomorphic if there exists a linear transformation $T: V \to V'$ such that $T \cdot \rho = \rho' \cdot T$. In the case where $V = V'$, we would call these representations isomorphic if $\rho' = T \cdot \rho \cdot T^{-1} = c_T\circ \rho$, where $c_T$ is conjugation by $T$. Conceptually this makes sense to me because if we identify these two vector spaces using any choice of bases, then this definition essentially says that a change of basis, i.e. how we write the same transformations shouldn't change the representation. However, if we consider $k$-vector spaces where $GL_n(k)$ has non-trivial outer automorphisms, i.e. automorphisms which are not conjugation by some element, we could call two representations $\rho, \rho':G \to GL_n(k)$ isomorphic if $\rho = \phi\circ \rho'$ for any $GL_n(k)$ automorphism $\phi$. This seems similar and a good candidate because in this case too we can always recover a representation from any isomorphic copies, if we know what the isomorphism is, and because the actions of the group elements maintain their relations under such an isomorphism. An example of this sort of outer automorphism is complex conjugation in $GL_2 (\mathbb{C})$; this is not inner because for any matrix with a non-real determinant, the determinant changes, whereas inner automorphisms must preserve determinants. I can see that we don't actually define isomorphisms in this fashion because if we did we would lose the uniqueness of the characters up to isomorphism (at the very least). My questions are the following: If two representations are related in this fashion (i.e. $\rho = \phi \circ \rho'$), what can we say about them? If one is irreducible, is the other irreducible too? If so, how exactly do outer automorphisms act on the set of irreducible representations of a fixed dimension? Can we calculate the decomposition of one representation using the decomposition of the other? Is there any nice correspondence? What does the action of outer automorphisms do at the level of characters? Can this action be described intrinsically on the vector space of class functions? I think that there are a lot of other questions one could ask in this set-up; any remarks about this situation would be welcome. If there are better answers for similar cases (wherever the question makes sense), for instance locally compact or reductive groups, they would be welcome too.","In J.P.

But it was associated with a grave weakness, in that the substitutions   thus performed were always of this very special kind, with the   particular feature that no letter could ever be enciphered into   itself. This passage suggests that any encoding that performs swappings, and is thus self-inverse, must have the property that no letter is ""enciphered into itself"". However this isn't the case, is it? Isn't this only a property of ""swappings"" in which all letters are swapped for a different letter. That is, doesn't he mean to say that the Enigma substitutions ""would always be swappings of every letter for a different one "" so that the non-substitution of the same letter is enforced by the specific swappings preformed by the machine? If so, how is the property of ""non-self-substitution"" achieved by the machine as a whole? I can see that at the reflector is physically constrained to have this property, but the plugboard clearly lacks it, as does at least one rotor (Rotor III substitutes N for N). And in any case, it isn't clear to me how self-substituted in guaranteed to be avoided in all possible configurations and rotor positions. What specific properties of the components and configuration of the Enigma machine ensure that no letter is substituted for itself? Does it follow from some basic property of permutations, or is it the result of specific wiring configurations, deliberately made to avoid self-substitution?",,"['group-theory', 'permutations', 'cryptography']"

Then \begin{equation}G\cong\Bbb Z^r\times\Bbb Z_{n_1}\times \Bbb Z_{n_2}\times\dots\times\Bbb Z_{n_s},\tag1\end{equation} For some integers $r,n_1,n_2,\dots,n_s$ satisfying the following conditions: $r\ge 0$ and $n_j\ge 2$ for all $j$ , and $n_{i+1}\mid n_i$ for $1\le i\le s-1$ The expression in $(1)$ is unique: if $G\cong\Bbb Z^t\times\Bbb Z_{m_1}\times \Bbb Z_{m_2}\times\dots\times\Bbb Z_{m_u}$ , where $t$ and $m_1,m_2,\dots,m_u$ satisfy 1. and 2. (i.e., $t\ge 0$ , $m_j\ge 2$ for all $j$ and $m_{i+1}\mid m_i$ for $1\le i\le u-1$ ), then $t=r$ , $u=s$ and $m_i=n_i$ for all $i$ . This gives us an effective way of listing all finite abelian groups of a given order.  Namely, to find (up to isomorphism) all abelian groups of a given order $n$ one must find all finite sequences of integers $n_1, n_2,\dots,n_s$ such that $n_j\ge 2$ for all $j\in\{1,2,\dots,s\}$ , $n_{i+1}\mid n_i$ , $1\le i\le s-1$ , and $n_1 n_2\dots n_s=n$ We can also note that every prime divisior of $n$ must divide the first invariant factor $n_1$ .  In particular, if $n$ is the product of distinct primes, which are all to the first power, which is called squarefree, we see that $n|n_1$ , hence $n=n_1$ .  This proves that if $n$ is squarefree, there is only one possible list of invariant factors for an abelian group of order $n$ .  The factorization of $n$ into prime powers is the first step in determining all possible lists of invariant factors for abelian groups of order $n$ . This means that we can break 8 $8$ down into its prime factors which would give us the following: $$88=2\cdot 44=2\cdot 2\cdot 22=2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 11$$ So if we say that $n=88=2^3\cdot 11$ , as we have stated above we must have that $2×11|n_1$ , so possible values of $n_1$ are as follows: $$n_1=2^3\cdot 11~\lor~n_1=2^2\cdot 11~\lor~n_1=2\cdot 11$$ For each of these we need to work out the possible $n_2$ ’s.  For each resulting pair $n_1,n_2$ we need to then work out the possible $n_3$ ’s and then continue in this manner until all lists satisfying 1. and 3. are obtained. Therefore $88$ can be written as $2^3\cdot 11$ .  Which would give us the following: Order $p^\beta$ : Partitions of $\beta$ Abelian Groups $$2^3:~3,~\Bbb Z_8;~~~2,1,~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_2;~~~1,1,1,~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2$$ $$11^1:~1,~\Bbb Z_{11}$$ We can obtain the abelian groups of order $88$ by taking one abelian group from each of the two lists above and taking their direct product.  Doing this in all possible ways gives all isomorphism types: $$\Bbb Z_{88},~\Bbb Z_8\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{22},~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_{22},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{44}$$ When we have completed this we will have $12$ groups.  By the Fundamental Theorems above, this is a complete list of all abelian groups of order $88$ , every abelian group of this order is isomorphic to precisely one of the groups above and no two of the groups in this list are isomorphic. We can then define abelian and non-abelian groups.  Abelian groups or commutative groups are groups in which the results of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written, in other words these groups are are groups that following the axiom of commutativity. Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.  Non-abelian groups, also known as non-commutative groups are groups $(G,*)$ in which there exists at least one pair of elements $a$ and $b$ of $G$ , such that $a*b\ne b*a$ . Of these $12$ groups $3$ of them are abelian and the other $9$ are non-abelian groups. The three abelian groups are $\Bbb Z_{88}$ , $\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_{22}$ , and $\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{22}$ .","Classify the groups of order up to isomorphism. Here is what I have so far (I'm aware that there are groups, but I don't know which ones I'm missing as well as why the groups are abelian and the other are non-abelian.) We are asked to classify the groups of order up to isomorphism.  To prove that any group of order is abelian.  So if , then we can construct all abelian groups of order by using the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian groups.  We can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups wich  states the following: Let is a finitely generated abelian group. Then For some integers satisfying the following conditions: and for all , and for The expression in is unique: if , where and satisfy 1. and 2. (i.e., , for all and for ), then , and for all .

This proves that if is squarefree, there is only one possible list of invariant factors for an abelian group of order .  The factorization of into prime powers is the first step in determining all possible lists of invariant factors for abelian groups of order . This means that we can break 8 down into its prime factors which would give us the following: So if we say that , as we have stated above we must have that , so possible values of are as follows: For each of these we need to work out the possible ’s.  For each resulting pair we need to then work out the possible ’s and then continue in this manner until all lists satisfying 1. and 3. are obtained. Therefore can be written as .

In any case, I'm almost certain it's not what I'm supposed to learn from this exercise. Is there a simpler method or an obvious group isomorphism between the groups that's I'm not seeing?",,['group-theory']
