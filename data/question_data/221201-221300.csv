To start, one has that $X$ without its singularities has Euler characteristic $-176$ by a couple adjunctions. Then one can find the singularities fairly easily, and we have 32 nodes (orbit of $(1:1:1:1:1:1)$ under the symmetries of the curve) and 12 type $(2,2,4,4)$ singularities (orbit of $(1:i:0:0:0:0)$ under the same symmetries).

This explains the first equation completely. Now taking a small resolution of $X$ at each of the nodes simply adds one to the Euler characteristic, for each node, as a $\mathbb{P}^1$ adds two, and removing the node itself subtracts one. Now we take a small resolution of each $(2,2,4,4)$ singularity, so as before, the Milnor number of each singularity is 9, and we add an exceptional $\mathbb{P}^1$ in place of each node, so... this gives $12(2-9) = -84...$ of a change to the Euler characteristic?

30,What does it mean geometrically for a graded ring to be generated in degree $1$?,What does it mean geometrically for a graded ring to be generated in degree ?,1,"This is a rather basic question that I have never really thought about until now, when I was forced to think about a sheafy version. This condition is needed for example to define the relative Proj construction, and I don't understand what exactly about it is making something 'projective.' Here's an example result who's proof I understand algebraically, but not geometrically. I would like to explain geometrically what this proof is about. Consider the well-known result that if $f: Z \to X$ is a projective, birational map between quasiprojective varieties, there is a coherent sheaf of ideals $\mathscr{I}$ on $X$ so that $Z \simeq \tilde{X}$ , the blow up with respect to $I$ . This is proven in Hartshorne and the proof sketch is as follows. Since $f$ is projective we have a map $i: Z \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_X$ and an invertible sheaf $\mathscr{L} = i^\ast \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ on $Z$ . We define $\mathscr{S} = \bigoplus_{d \geq 0} \mathscr{L}^d$ . Since $\mathscr{L}$ is coherent, each power is and the sum is quasicoherent. The condition to make $Z$ the Proj of something is that $\mathscr{S}$ needs to be generated in degree $1$ . This isn't the case, so we work affinely and find a related algebra corresponding to a degree $D$ Veronese embedding so that after composing $i$ above with the Veronese embedding, the condition holds. Some more technicalities follow in this argument concerning whether or not we have a coherent sheaf of ideals, and arranging this to be the case, but the primary issue has already arisen. What is this Veronese embedding doing, geometrically? I understand how it takes degree $D$ things to hyperplanes - this isn't quite what I'm looking for and is a little bit on-the-nose. Stated another way, what is composing with this embedding fixing about this object in projective space that is detected about being generated in degree $1$ , that isn't there in general?

74,Characterization of Horizontal Irreducible Divisors,Characterization of Horizontal Irreducible Divisors,,"I´m asking for a proof of a fact used by Arakelov in his paper: Intersection Theory of Divisors on an Arithmetic Surface (page 1169 row 16). He gives no references or explanations for this fact. The setup is the following, $X$ is a smooth complete curve over a number field $K$ with ring of integers $\Lambda$. $V$ is a regular complete model of $X$ over $Spec(\Lambda)$, i.e. a regular fibered arithmetic surface with a proper morphism $f:V \rightarrow Spec(\Lambda)$ such that the fiber over the generic point is the original curve $X$. $D$ is an irreducible horizontal divisor on $V$, i.e. a prime divisor in Hartshorne´s notations such that $f(D)=Spec(\Lambda)$. The claim is the following. There exists a finite field extension $L/K$ with ring of integers $\Gamma$, and a $Spec(\Lambda)$-morphism $\epsilon: Spec(\Gamma) \rightarrow V$ such that $\epsilon(Spec(\Gamma))=D$. And this is my work. My idea was to prove some finiteness condition on the map $f|_D$ in order to use the fact, stated for example in Matsumura´s Commutative Ring Theory, that an extension of rings $A \subset B$ is integral if and only if every element of $B$ is contained in a finitely generated $A$-module. Proceeding in that direction I proved that $f|_D$ is of finite type (clear because $f$ is proper), it is generically finite (because by irreducibility of $D$ its preimage on the generic point is a single closed point of $X$) and it is dominant (because $D$ is  horizontal). Using Exercise 3.7. of Hartshorne we get that there exists an open dense subset $W\subseteq Spec(\Lambda)$ such that $f|_D:f|_D^{-1}(W) \rightarrow W$ is finite, moreover the function field $K(D)$ of $D$ is a finite field extension of $K$ (so my guess is $L=K(D)$, also because I don´t see any other possible candidate). Unfortunately I have no idea on how to proceed further. There any suggestions? (or complete proves... :) ) Thank you in advance! Edit 1: According to the excellent answer of Matt there is only one point that still bother me. In order to use the Valuative Criterion we need $\Gamma$ to be a Valuation Ring , but to be the ring of integers of a number field is clearly not enough. For example $\mathbb{Z}$ is not a Valuation Ring. So, how can we prove that $\Gamma$ is a Valuation Ring? Edit 2: This is the answer to the question in Edit 1. The proof was sketched by Matt E in a comment to his own answer, I have just expanded it with details (and maybe errors!). I write it here because it could be useful and because I hope that, if my checkings are wrong, someone could point it out! We have a map $\varphi: Spec(L) \rightarrow V$ and we want extend it to a map $Spec(\Gamma) \rightarrow V$. Since $f$ is proper it is of finite type and the point $P$ has a neighborhood of the form $Spec(A)$ such that $A$ is a finitely generated $\Lambda$-algebra. Moreover by integrality of $V$ the fraction field of $A$ is (at least) a subfield of $L$. In specific there is an extension of algebras $A \rightarrow \Lambda[l_1,...,l_n]$ where $l_1,...,l_n \in L$. Define $\lambda$ to be the common denominator of the $l_i$, $\lambda \in \Gamma$. Then the map $A \rightarrow L$ factorizes through $Spec(\Gamma[\frac{1}{\lambda}])$ and we have a natural extension of $\varphi$ to $\hat{\varphi}:Spec(\Gamma[\frac{1}{\lambda}]) \rightarrow Spec(A) \subset V$.

The proposition is as follows: Let $f : X \ra Y$ be a morphism of schemes, where $X$ is noetherian and $Y = \text{Spec} A$ is affine. Then for any $ \F \in \QCoh(X)$ and $i \geq 0$ there exists a canonical isomorphism of sheaves of modules on $Y$ natural in $\F$ $$ \beta : R^if_* \F \longrightarrow \widetilde{H^i(X, \F)}.$$ The proof goes as follows (I've denoted my questions with "" Q: ""): $R^if_* \F$ has a canonical $\oh_Y$ -module structure and $H^i(X, \F)$ has a canonical $\Gamma(X, \F)$ -module structure, and since $\Gamma(X, \F)$ has the structure of an $A$ -module, $H^i(X, \F)$ has an $A$ -module structure. Also, $X$ noetherian implies that $f_* \F \in \QCoh(Y)$ . Therefore, we have a canonical isomorphism of sheaves $$ f_* \F \cong \widetilde{\Gamma(X, \F)}. $$ Q: I'm not sure why we have this. I know that if in general $\F$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on $X$ , then for $U_i$ opens of a particular cover of $X$ , we have $\F|_{U_i} \cong \widetilde{F(U_i)}$ . But I'm not sure as to how we derive the above? I've tried $$ f_* \F|_{U_i} = \F(f^{-1}(-))|_{U_i} $$ but this doesn't really get me anywhere. Proceeding with the proof, we have for $i=0$ a canonical isomorphism natural in $\F$ $$ \mu^0 : R^0f_* \F \cong f_* \F \cong \widetilde{\Gamma(X, \F)} = \widetilde{H^0(X, \F)} \quad \checkmark $$ Now, since the tilde functor $\widetilde{-}: A \Mod \ra \oh_Y \Mod$ is exact, we have two cohomological $\delta$ -functors $\{ R^i f_*(-) \}_{i \geq 0}$ and $\{ \widetilde{H^i(X, -)} \}_{i \geq 0}$ between $\QCoh(X)$ and $\oh_Y \Mod$ . Q: Why does this follow from exactness of the tilde functor? Apologies; this may be obvious (I'm not too brushed up on my $\delta$ -functor knowledge). Quasi-coherent sheaves may be embedded into flasque quasi-coherent sheaves. Hence, both functors are effaceable for $i>0$ . Q: Why does the $\delta$ -functors being effaceable follow from this? Effaceable means (in this case) that for any object $\F \in \QCoh(X)$ there exists a monomorphism $u : \F \ra \mathcal{G}$ such that $\{ R^i f_*(u) \}_{i \geq 0} = 0$ and $\{\widetilde{H^i(X, u)} \}_{i \geq 0}=0$ , some $\mathcal{G}$ . I think that this is because we can say $u$ is the embedding into a flasque quasi-coherent sheaf, and since sheaf cohomology vanishes for flasque sheaves and higher direct images, we get the result.

For surfaces, I suspect that homeomorphism should be given by an algebraic map but I'm not able to prove it.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'zariski-topology']"

My first thought is to just take $\mathcal L=\widetilde{\mathfrak a}$, but this doesn't seem to be locally trivial.

The latter condition is equivalent to there existing some $n\ge0$ such that $\alpha_i^n\in\mathfrak a$.

I think one can try to reduce this problem to the affine case, but I am not really firm with working with schemes, and the whole algebraic geometry does not really suit me.

Determine the algebraic dimension of the following manifolds: $\mathbb{P}^1$, $\mathbb{P}^n$, and the complex torus $\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+i\mathbb{Z})$. For the latter, you might need to recall some basic facts on the Weierstrass $\wp$-function. How big is the function field of $\mathbb{C}$? The algebraic dimension of $X$ is defined to be the transcendence degree of the function field $K(X)$, the field of meromorphic functions on $X$. And there is a propostion 2.1.9 (Siegel) states that the algebraic dimension of a compact connected manifold is not greater than the geometric (complex) dimension. My attempt: For $\mathbb{P}^1$ this is trivial: the algebraic dimension is $1$ since there are non-trivial meromorphic functions (e.g. the identity map is holomorphic) on the Riemann sphere, so the dimension is greater than $0$. The function field of $\mathbb{C}$ should have an infinite algebraic dimension since the functions $f(z)=z^k, k=1, 2, \cdots$ are holomorphic.
