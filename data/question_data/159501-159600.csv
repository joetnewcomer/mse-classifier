I just cannot get my head around the solution posted. Can someone explain further? Challenge Find a rational number (a fraction of two integers) that satisfies the following conditions: 1)Its denominator is five digits long and all of them are different. 2)In the infinite decimal representation, every digit occurs an equal number of times in the digits from one billion to two billion places to the right of the decimal point (inclusive), except for the last digit in the denominator, which occurs twice as often as the other nine digits. 3)Its numerator contains as few different digits as possible. Update 6/4: To clarify the problem, here is an example: 5/17 = 0.294117647058823529411764705882... and in the 11 digit in the places 20-30 after the decimal point the digit 7 (the last digit of the demonimator) appears twice as many times as the digit 4, but not twice as many as the digit 9 (which does not appear there at all). Solution The way to have one digit appear twice as many times as the other nine is to set a period of 11 digits. To do that, we need the fraction to be X/99999999999. Factoring the denominator leads us to 21649 as the denominator, and looking at the possible numerators we find that 639/21649 solves the first two conditions.  To get fewer number of distinct digits, 646/21649 may seem to be the best solution (there are only two different digits), but using improper fractions, we can get the best solution: 333333/21649.","This was the challenge in last month's 'IBM Reseach Ponder This'.

However for positions 9 and 10 - such randomization was not achieved yet within first 62 sets ...(though looking outside of presented so far 62 sets data and relying on the known observation that eventually the average digit value in the decimal expansion of Pi comes practically to 4.5), I could ""speculate"" in advance that it will come to 4.5 eventually and for positions 9 and 10 too ... - but it looks like that positions 9 and 10 are ""randomizing"" at much slowly rate than the other 8 positions ... and that might be (or might not be) interesting. I am not sure  how many more sets (beyond 62, which I presented here) are needed to get arithmetic averages for ""ninth"" and ""tenth"" digit positions (within the set) to reach the same proximity of 4.5 for average value, as it is achieved already by first 8 positions within those 62 sets ... . It is also notable that if to average positions 9 and 10 together, the average between those two, within available so far 62 sets, will be close to 4.5. Conclusion and questions There appears to be that those first 62 sets listed above have a slight hint of retaining some loose organizational order between predecessor sets and successor sets. But I presume that further ""down the road"", beyond the first 62 sets, one will see that  gradually the level of randomness in sets digits composition order is increasing and adjacent sets become more more disconnected from each other. What I am trying to say that in case of digits Pi (after applied above discussed reordering) it appears that there exists some sort of transition from initial order (within first 620 digits) to total randomness ... I used Maximal information-based nonparametric exploration statistical analysis program (MINE) by ""David Reshef at al "". Being applied (by me ) ""pairwise"" to the first 62 terms, MINE shows high values (up to 1) of the  maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is a measure of two-variable dependence designed specifically for rapid exploration of many-dimensional data sets. The links (thanks to LVK for the upload) to the excel spreadsheet, turned into the comma separated value file (.csv),  with the data (62 sets of reordered Pi digits) and the MINE generated output .csv file, which was produced (at my home PC Windows based computer) upon executing java -jar MINE.jar PiReordered.csv -allPairs  cv=1.0 correspondingly are https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv and https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv%2Callpairs%2Ccv%3D1.0%2CB%3Dn%5E0.6%2CResults.csv Does such concept of transition from order to randomness exist ? Could this above observation be statistically confirmed or disproved ? If ""yes"" -  what specific tools / methods of statistical analysis could be applied ? I also received suggestion that in order to test whether this discussed above feature is only characteristic to (some initial digits of) Pi, the same reordering should be applied to the some significant number of randomly generated very long strings of decimal digits  - to see if there the same pattern behavior will appear or not - is it useful ? Thanks, Best Regards, Alexander R. Povolotsky PS - in response to LVK's answer and his comment, which I am quotting here ""The nth line of your table consists of the digits written in the order of their nth appearance in π. This could be in principle read off the graph by crossing it with the horizontal line y=n and reading off the intersection points from left to right. (In practice this is not convenient due to the low resolution and overlap between the curves.) ..... I don't think there is any statistical method for analysis of the data organized in this way. You'll probably need to devise one yourself. ..... – LVK Sep 10 at 16:02"" LVK - thanks for your thoughts and valuable contribution ! I think though that the frequency chart somewhat hides away the positional dependency between the unique digits of the {1,2,...,9,0} set. The table presentation with the columns representing the particular combination of (all) digits (from 1 to 0 in above mentioned set) for each consecutive ten digit collection is, in my opinion, more revealing in that regard. My questions still remain to be in place: 1) is there some ""other"" (I would call it ""transitional"") non-randomness exists for some few hundreds ""initial"" digits of Pi (beyond the order imposed by the re-arrangement itself), which is getting revealed by this re-arrangement ? 2) what (other than MINE) quantative statistical methods/tools could be used in analysis of this situation - PPS I am trying to rework first 3 columns  in already posted MINE results csv file (where first two columns are ""textually enumerated"" names of the 10 digitt sets, like for example ""18thSet"", and the 3rd column is MIC value for the two sets identified in the first two columns at the same row) into three (3)-dimensional ""surface"" chart with each column, mentioned above, be correspondingly x,y and z values ... Doing it manually via converting into table -- by keeping the first column in tact, transposing the second column into up-most row  and filling the table's body by the MIC values from the 3rd column is very laborious. I found discussion at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7083044/mathematica-csv-to-multidimensional-charts how to do it with Mathematica, but I don't have it ... Could some one (who has Mathematica) be kind enough to do it (and post) ?","First let me try to describe in more details below the approach of ""reordering"" digits of Pi, which is used in OEIS A096566 https://oeis.org/A096566 and what I have done analyzing it so far.

However for positions 9 and 10 - such randomization was not achieved yet within first 62 sets ...(though looking outside of presented so far 62 sets data and relying on the known observation that eventually the average digit value in the decimal expansion of Pi comes practically to 4.5), I could ""speculate"" in advance that it will come to 4.5 eventually and for positions 9 and 10 too ... - but it looks like that positions 9 and 10 are ""randomizing"" at much slowly rate than the other 8 positions ... and that might be (or might not be) interesting. I am not sure  how many more sets (beyond 62, which I presented here) are needed to get arithmetic averages for ""ninth"" and ""tenth"" digit positions (within the set) to reach the same proximity of 4.5 for average value, as it is achieved already by first 8 positions within those 62 sets ... . It is also notable that if to average positions 9 and 10 together, the average between those two, within available so far 62 sets, will be close to 4.5. Conclusion and questions There appears to be that those first 62 sets listed above have a slight hint of retaining some loose organizational order between predecessor sets and successor sets. But I presume that further ""down the road"", beyond the first 62 sets, one will see that  gradually the level of randomness in sets digits composition order is increasing and adjacent sets become more more disconnected from each other. What I am trying to say that in case of digits Pi (after applied above discussed reordering) it appears that there exists some sort of transition from initial order (within first 620 digits) to total randomness ... I used Maximal information-based nonparametric exploration statistical analysis program (MINE) by ""David Reshef at al "". Being applied (by me ) ""pairwise"" to the first 62 terms, MINE shows high values (up to 1) of the  maximal information coefficient (MIC), which is a measure of two-variable dependence designed specifically for rapid exploration of many-dimensional data sets. The links (thanks to LVK for the upload) to the excel spreadsheet, turned into the comma separated value file (.csv),  with the data (62 sets of reordered Pi digits) and the MINE generated output .csv file, which was produced (at my home PC Windows based computer) upon executing java -jar MINE.jar PiReordered.csv -allPairs  cv=1.0 correspondingly are https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv and https://dl.dropbox.com/u/29863189/PiReordered.csv%2Callpairs%2Ccv%3D1.0%2CB%3Dn%5E0.6%2CResults.csv Does such concept of transition from order to randomness exist ? Could this above observation be statistically confirmed or disproved ? If ""yes"" -  what specific tools / methods of statistical analysis could be applied ? I also received suggestion that in order to test whether this discussed above feature is only characteristic to (some initial digits of) Pi, the same reordering should be applied to the some significant number of randomly generated very long strings of decimal digits  - to see if there the same pattern behavior will appear or not - is it useful ? Thanks, Best Regards, Alexander R. Povolotsky PS - in response to LVK's answer and his comment, which I am quotting here ""The nth line of your table consists of the digits written in the order of their nth appearance in π. This could be in principle read off the graph by crossing it with the horizontal line y=n and reading off the intersection points from left to right. (In practice this is not convenient due to the low resolution and overlap between the curves.) ..... I don't think there is any statistical method for analysis of the data organized in this way. You'll probably need to devise one yourself. ..... – LVK Sep 10 at 16:02"" LVK - thanks for your thoughts and valuable contribution ! I think though that the frequency chart somewhat hides away the positional dependency between the unique digits of the {1,2,...,9,0} set. The table presentation with the columns representing the particular combination of (all) digits (from 1 to 0 in above mentioned set) for each consecutive ten digit collection is, in my opinion, more revealing in that regard. My questions still remain to be in place: 1) is there some ""other"" (I would call it ""transitional"") non-randomness exists for some few hundreds ""initial"" digits of Pi (beyond the order imposed by the re-arrangement itself), which is getting revealed by this re-arrangement ? 2) what (other than MINE) quantative statistical methods/tools could be used in analysis of this situation - PPS I am trying to rework first 3 columns  in already posted MINE results csv file (where first two columns are ""textually enumerated"" names of the 10 digitt sets, like for example ""18thSet"", and the 3rd column is MIC value for the two sets identified in the first two columns at the same row) into three (3)-dimensional ""surface"" chart with each column, mentioned above, be correspondingly x,y and z values ... Doing it manually via converting into table -- by keeping the first column in tact, transposing the second column into up-most row  and filling the table's body by the MIC values from the 3rd column is very laborious. I found discussion at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7083044/mathematica-csv-to-multidimensional-charts how to do it with Mathematica, but I don't have it ... Could some one (who has Mathematica) be kind enough to do it (and post) ?",,"['number-theory', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'analytic-number-theory', 'random']"

Following Milne (""Etale Cohomology"", Chapter I, Paragraph 5, example e)), $Spec(K)$ is the algebraic analogue of a punctured disc in the plane. The cited example is about the calculation of the tame fundamental group (in the Grothendieck sense) of that disc. Milne, citing Serre (""Corps Locaux"", Chapter IV), says that every tamely ramified extension of $K$ (so every tamely ramified covering of $Spec(K)$) is a Kummer extension of $K$. Unfortunately the book of Serre seems to explain only the restrictive case: $K=\mathbb{C}((z))$. Why this is true in general? In specific the problems seem to arise when the characteristic of the residue field of $A$ is not zero anymore. I thought also to have problems, related to this question, regarding the possible non algebraic closure of the residue field of $A$. But, since we are looking only for tamely ramified extensions, the strict Henselianity of $A$ is enough to avoid those problems. Moreover I'm interested in the more general case of $A$ being the strict Henselianization of the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ of a sheaf on a point $x$ of a scheme $X$, so $A$ being strictly Henselian but not a discrete valuation ring anymore.

Any help in writing a complete and correct proof : To show that there are only finitely many pairs of positive integers $(n, m)$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ , where $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$ , we need to compare the growth rates of $d(m!)$ and $n!$ . Understanding the Growth of $d(m!)$ The number of divisors of $m!$ , denoted $d(m!)$ , depends on the prime factorization of $m!$ . If $m!$ is expressed as $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ , where $p_i$ are primes and $e_i$ are their respective exponents, then: The number of divisors $d(m!)$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$ . The exponents $e_i$ for each prime $p_i$ can be approximated as: $e_i$ is roughly the sum of the integer divisions $\left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{p_i^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots$ .

Comparing Growth Rates Let's approximate the growth rate of $d(m!)$ : The number of prime numbers less than or equal to $m$ is approximately $\frac{m}{\log m}$ by the Prime Number Theorem. Each $e_i$ is roughly $\frac{m}{p_i}$ , and the product $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$ grows very rapidly. Growth of $n!$ : Stirling's approximation for $n!$ provides a way to understand its growth: $n!$ grows roughly as $\sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n$ . Comparing $d(m!)$ and $n!$ To compare $d(m!)$ and $n!$ : $d(m!)$ grows super-exponentially with $m$ , much faster than the factorial function $n!$ grows with $n$ . For large $m$ , $d(m!)$ becomes significantly larger than any $n!$ . This means that for sufficiently large $m$ , there cannot be an $n$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ . Since $d(m!)$ grows much faster than $n!$ as $m$ and $n$ increase, there can only be finitely many pairs $(n, m)$ such that $d(m!) = n!$ .

Ellipse Given the general equation, $$a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (c + m)^3$$ Let, \begin{align} c &= (n + 1)(a - m) + n b\\ a &= p + q + m + 4 m n + 3 m n^2\\  b &= p - q + 2 m n + 3 m n^2 \end{align} and after removing a trivial factor, it becomes the simple ellipse centered at the origin, $$p^2 + 3 q^2 = d$$ where $d = 3m^2 n(n+1) (3 n^2 + 3n + 1).$ For example, the ellipse $p^2+3q^2-7=0$ . Choose some desired $d$ with integer $(p,q)$ . Thus we need to solve for $m$ , $$m = d\,\sqrt{\frac1{3d n(n+1) (3 n^2 + 3n + 1)}}$$ and find rational $n$ such that $m$ is also rational. Assume prime $d=1\,(\text{mod}\,6)$ , or Euler's Theorem , say $d=p^2+3q^2=7$ so $(p,q) = (2,1)$ . Then one solution is $n = 1/3,\, m = 3/2$ . Substituting $(p,q,m,n)$ into the expressions for $(a,b,c)$ , we find, $$\left(\frac{42}{6}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{15}{6}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{49}{6}\right)^3=\left(\frac{49}{6}+\frac{3}{2}\right)^3$$ II.

We wish to show that $\overline{\rho}_{E,5}$ is modular. This follows immediately from the following lemma from the DDT notes: Lemma 3.49 : There is a semistable elliptic curve $A/\mathbb Q$ such that $A[5] \simeq E[5]$ as $G_\mathbb Q$ -modules. $A[3]$ is an irreducible $G_\mathbb Q$ -module. Proof: Let $Y'(5)$ be the $\mathbb Q$ -curve classifying elliptic curves $A$ together with an isomorphism $E[5] \simeq A[5]$ compatible with Weil pairings. Elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$ satisfying 1) correspond to points in $Y'(5)(\mathbb Q)$ . Adjoining finitely many points to $Y'(5)$ gives its compactification $X'(5)$ which is a twist of $X(5)$ . We know that $X(5)$ has genus $0$ as a $\mathbb C$ -curve. Since $X'(5)$ has a point $x_0$ over $\mathbb Q$ corresponding to $E$ , it is isomorphic to $\mathbb P^1$ over $\mathbb Q$ . The rational points of $Y'(5)$ therefore give a large supply of elliptic curves satisfying 1). Consider the curve $Y'(5,3)$ classifying elliptic curves $A$ satisfying 1) and equipped with a subgroup of order 3. One quickly checks that its compactification $X'(5,3)$ has genus $> 1$ and hence has only finitely many rational points by Faltings' Theorem. Hence only finitely many points in $Y'(5)(\mathbb Q)$ are in the image of $Y'(5,3)(\mathbb Q)$ under the natural map $Y'(5,3) \to Y'(5)$ . Hence for all but finitely many $x \in Y'(5)(\mathbb Q)$ , the corresponding $A$ satisfies 2) since it has no rational subgroup of order 3. Choose $x$ arbitrarily close in the 5-adic topology to $x_0$ to find an elliptic curve $A$ (associated to $x$ ) which is semistable and satisfying 1) and 2). Hence the Lemma. I fail to understand the last line of the proof: why does choosing $x$ 5-adically close to $x_0$ give us a semistable elliptic curve $A$ with the desired properties? What does the 5-adic topology have to do with anything? Correct me if I am wrong here: it seems we have established a) and b) in the preceding lines of the proof, so it seems to me that this 5-adic topology argument must be being used to establish semistability.

MOTIVATION Denote the classical sum of divisors of the positive integer $x$ by $\sigma(x)=\sigma_1(x)$ . (Note that the divisor sum $\sigma$ is a multiplicative function .) A number $P$ is said to be perfect if $\sigma(P)=2P$ .  If a perfect number $N$ is odd , then $N$ is called an odd perfect number .  Euler proved that a hypothetical odd perfect number $N$ must have the form $$N = q^k n^2$$ where $q$ is the special prime satisfying $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $\gcd(q,n)=1$ . It is known that $$i(q)=\gcd(n^2,\sigma(n^2))=\frac{n^2}{\sigma(q^k)/2}=\frac{\sigma(n^2)}{q^k},$$ where $i(q)=\sigma(N/{q^k})/{q^k}$ is the index of $N$ at the (special) prime $q$ , as initially defined by Broughan, Delbourgo, and Zhou , and whose results were eventually improved upon by Chen and Chen . In a recent preprint , Dris proves that the following implication holds: $$i(q) \text{ is squarefree } \implies \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{2} \text{ is not squarefree.} \tag{1}$$ We likewise obtain the biconditional $$i(q) \text{ is a square } \iff \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{2} \text{ is a square.}$$ This implies that we have the chain of implications $$i(q) \text{ is a square } \implies \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{2} \text{ is a square } \implies \frac{\sigma(q^k)}{2} \text{ is not squarefree.} \tag{2}$$ This MSE answer proves the following Conjecture: If $q^k n^2$ is an odd perfect number with special prime $q$ and $q = k$ , then $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is not squarefree . These findings highly suggest that $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is not squarefree . My question is as follows: Do you see a way of proving that $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is not squarefree ? MY ATTEMPT Suppose to the contrary that $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree.  Since $$i(q) = \frac{n^2}{\sigma(q^k)/2}$$ and $i(q)$ is an (odd) integer, then $\sigma(q^k)/2 \mid n^2$ .  Now, the assumption that $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree would imply that $\sigma(q^k)/2 \mid n$ . But we can rewrite $$\frac{n^2}{\sigma(q^k)/2}=\frac{\sigma(n^2)}{q^k}$$ as $$\frac{\sigma(n^2)}{n}=\frac{q^k n}{\sigma(q^k)/2}$$ which means that $\sigma(q^k)/2 \mid n$ is equivalent to $n \mid \sigma(n^2)$ , since $q^k$ and $\sigma(q^k)/2$ are coprime. Now, let $$G = \gcd(\sigma(q^k),\sigma(n^2)) = \sigma(q^k)/2$$ $$H = i(q) = \gcd(n^2,\sigma(n^2)) = \frac{n^2}{\sigma(q^k)/2}$$ $$I = \gcd(n,\sigma(n^2)) = n$$ $$J = \frac{n}{\gcd(\sigma(q^k)/2,n)} = \frac{n}{\sigma(q^k)/2}$$ Since $$H = G \times J^2$$ and because of the following (which hold under the assumption that $G=\sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree): (1) $J = 1$ if and only if $H$ is squarefree.  (Note that, under the assumption that $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree, we get that $H$ is not squarefree.  Therefore, $\sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree implies that $J > 1$ .) (2) $G = 1$ if and only if $H$ is a square.  (Note that $G = \sigma(q^k)/2 \geq \frac{q^k + 1}{2} \geq 3$ , so that $H$ is not a square , if $G = \sigma(q^k)/2$ is squarefree.  This confirms the findings in this MO answer to a closely related question.) (3) The remaining case is when $G>1$ and $J>1$ . But $G$ is squarefree, together with the following identity $$G \times H = I^2$$ implies that $$G \mid I.$$ Throughout this paper , we implicitly rely on the simple equality $$\sigma(n^2) = \frac{2q^k n^2}{\sigma(q^k)}. \tag{3}$$ Unfortunately, this seems to introduce fractions.  To avoid that, we can use prime factorizations, as follows.  Write the prime factorization of $n$ as $$n = {p_1}^{a_1} \cdots {p_m}^{a_m},$$ for some unique odd primes $3 \leq p_1 < \ldots < p_m$ , and for some positive integer exponents $a_1, \ldots, a_m$ .  Since both sides of $(3)$ are integers, and since $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ with $q$ prime, we know that $$\sigma(q^k) = 2 {p_1}^{b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{b_m}$$ for some nonnegative integers $0 \leq b_i \leq 2a_i$ .  Thus, we have $$\sigma(n^2) = q^k {p_1}^{2a_1 - b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m - b_m}.$$ With this information, we immediately see that $$G := \gcd\left(\sigma(q^k),\sigma(n^2)\right) = \gcd\left(2 {p_1}^{b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{b_m},q^k {p_1}^{2a_1 - b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m - b_m}\right)$$ $$= {p_1}^{\min(b_1,2a_1 - b_1)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min(b_m,2a_m - b_m)},$$ $$H := \gcd\left(n^2,\sigma(n^2)\right) = \gcd\left({p_1}^{2a_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m}, q^k {p_1}^{2a_1 - b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m - b_m}\right)$$ $$= {p_1}^{2a_1 - b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m - b_m},$$ and $$I := \gcd\left(n,\sigma(n^2)\right) = \gcd\left({p_1}^{a_1} \cdots {p_m}^{a_m}, q^k {p_1}^{2a_1 - b_1} \cdots {p_m}^{2a_m - b_m}\right)$$ $$= {p_1}^{\min(a_1,2a_1 - b_1)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min(a_m,2a_m - b_m)}.$$ Lastly, I know that $$\gcd(G,J)={p_1}^{\min\left(\min(b_1,2a_1 - b_1),2a_1 - b_1 - \min(a_1,2a_1 - b_1)\right)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min\left(\min(b_m,2a_m - b_m),2a_m - b_m - \min(a_m,2a_m - b_m)\right)}$$ $$={p_1}^{\min\left(2a_1 - b_1,b_1,2a_1 - b_1 - \min(a_1,2a_1 - b_1)\right)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min\left(2a_m - b_m,b_m,2a_m - b_m - \min(a_m,2a_m - b_m)\right)}$$ $$={p_1}^{\min\left(b_1,\min(2a_1 - b_1,2a_1 - b_1 - \min(a_1,2a_1 - b_1))\right)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min\left(b_m,\min(2a_m - b_m,2a_m - b_m - \min(a_m,2a_m - b_m))\right)}$$ $$={p_1}^{\min\left(b_1,2a_1 - b_1 - \min(a_1,2a_1 - b_1)\right)} \cdots {p_m}^{\min\left(b_m,2a_m - b_m - \min(a_m,2a_m - b_m)\right)}.$$ Alas, this is where I get stuck!

The exercise is about the sign of the Gauss sum $g = \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \left(\frac{j}{p}\right)\zeta^j$ , where $p$ is a fixed prime and $\zeta = e^{2\pi i/p}$ . In the chapter this problem is reduced to showing that $\varepsilon = 1$ makes the following polynomial equality hold and $\varepsilon = -1$ doesn't (those are the only values $\varepsilon$ can take and we know one of them works). $$\sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{j}{p}\right)(1+t)^j-\varepsilon\prod_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}((1+t)^{2k-1}-(1+t)^{p-(2k-1)})=((1+t)^p-1)h(t)$$ Here $h(t)\in\mathbb{Z}[t]$ is some polynomial we're not interested in. Following the book's approach I looked at the coefficients of $t^{(p-1)/2}$ in both sides. On the left-hand side we have $$\sum_{j=(p-1)/2}^{p-1}\left(\frac{j}{p}\right)\binom{j}{(p-1)/2}-\varepsilon\prod_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}(4k-p-2)$$ and on the right-hand side we have a multiple of p, so equating mod $p$ and multiplying by $((p-1)/2)!$ yields $$\sum_{j=(p-1)/2}^{p-1}\left(\frac{j}{p}\right)j(j-1)...(j-(p-1)/2+1) \equiv \varepsilon((p-1)/2)!\prod_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}(4k-2) \equiv -\varepsilon \ (\textrm{mod}\ p).$$ The second congruence is not hard to justify. However, I have no idea how to show the first expression is -1. I've tried to interpret it as the polynomial $$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{p-1}\left(\frac{j}{p}\right)(x+j)(x+j-1)...(x+j-(p-1)/2+1)$$ evaluated at $x=0$ . I've expanded it for small primes and got that $f(x)$ is identically congruent to -1, but I don't know how to prove that in general.

74,Explicit Local Fundamental Class,Explicit Local Fundamental Class,,"Let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of local fields of degree $n:=[L:K]<\infty$ with Galois group $G:=\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)$ . In short, my question is as follows. Is there an explicit computation of the fundamental class $u_{L/K}\in H^2\left(G,L^\times\right)$ ? Here, the fundamental class is the generator of $H^2\left(G,L^\times\right)$ found by pulling back the generator $\frac1n\in\frac1n\mathbb Z/\mathbb Z$ along the invariant map $\operatorname{inv}_{L/K}:H^2\left(G,L^\times\right)\to\frac1n\mathbb Z/\mathbb Z$ . I record some thoughts below. In the case where $L/K$ is unramified with Galois group $G:=\operatorname{Gal}(L/K)=\langle\operatorname{Frob}_{L/K}\rangle$ , we have an explicit construction of the (local) invariant map $\operatorname{inv}_{L/K}:H^2\left(G,L^\times\right)\to\frac1n\mathbb Z/\mathbb Z$ by $$H^2\left(G,L^\times\right)\stackrel{\operatorname{ord}_L}\to H^2(G,\mathbb Z)\stackrel\delta\leftarrow H^1(G,\mathbb Q/\mathbb Z)\simeq\operatorname{Hom}_\mathbb Z(G,\mathbb Q/\mathbb Z)\stackrel{f\mapsto f(\operatorname{Frob}_{L/K})}\to\frac1n\mathbb Z/\mathbb Z,$$ and then we can pull the (more or less canonical) generator $\frac1n$ back to the (canonical) generator $u_{L/K}\in H^2(G,L^\times),$ which is called the fundamental class. All of this computation can be made explicit (see, for example the discussion preceding Proposition III.1.9 of Milne's notes ); for completeness, we record that the computation gives $$u_{L/K}\left(1,\operatorname{Frob}_{L/K}^k,\operatorname{Frob}_{L/K}^{k+\ell}\right)=\begin{cases} \varpi & k+\ell\ge n, \\ 1 & k+\ell<n, \end{cases}$$ where $\varpi$ is a uniformizer of $L.$ In the general case (i.e., dropping the assumption that $L/K$ is unramified), the invariant map is not so explicit. Looking the proofs I've found around, the most explicit construction comes from writing the exact sequence $$0\to H^2\left(\operatorname{Gal}(L/K),L^\times\right)\to H^2\left(\operatorname{Gal}(K^{\text{unr}}/K),K^{\text{unr}\times}\right)\to H^2\left(\operatorname{Gal}(L^{\text{unr}}/L),L^{\text{unr}\times}\right)$$ (It takes some amount of work to define the maps and check that this is in fact a short exact sequence; it is essentially Lemma III.2.2 in Milne's notes .)

Except that we obtain every power of two and only some powers of three. Whereas for the Collatz sums the reverse is true. The identity arises due to each triangle in Pascal's triangle mod 2 being followed by two 'child' triangles of equal size. Hence the sum of the first 2^n rows has 3^n '1's.

The apparent solution at first sight is $3$ , but I doubt if more solutions exist.

The addends are prime when $p = 7$ as well, but the sum is composite. $p = 11$ is invalid as the sum will be divisible by $11$ . Thus when $p$ is $13$ , the sum and the addends are prime again. Based in this observation, we can conjecture that primes of the form $10x + 3$ satisfy the conditions, but $23$ is a contradiction as one of the addends will turn composite.

I am a number theory researcher, but not within analytic number theory. One challenge I have faced is not having good intuition for what the answers should be (unless I see clearly a proof, which then creates a vicious circle!). Here is the question asked in its most basic form. Recall that $\omega(n)$ is used to denote the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$ . Let me call an integer $n$ good if for all primes $p \mid n$ , we have $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{8}$ . What is the asymptotic behavior of $\displaystyle D(t) = \sum_{\substack{n\leq t\\\text{$n$ good}}} 2^{\omega(n)}?$ What I seem to be able to see right now is that $D(t) = ct + o(t^{3/4})$ where $c = \frac{2\sqrt{2}\log(1+\sqrt{2})}{\pi^2}$ (see below). The issue is that the error term seems grossly overestimated. So, I am turning to you all to ask what better trained people can say about the sum $D(t)$ . Now I explain where this arises and what I know. The sum $D(t)$ arises from counting a certain set of ideals in the algebraic integer ring $\mathbf Z[\sqrt 2]$ . Namely, $D(t)$ counts the number of pairs of ideals $I,J \subseteq \mathbf Z[\sqrt 2]$ such that $N(I) = N(J)$ and $\gcd(I,J) = 1$ . Here $N(I)$ is the ideal norm (if $I$ is generated by $a+b\sqrt{2}$ then $N(I) = |a^2-2b^2|$ ). Second, I know just enough technique from analytic number theory to consider the Dirichlet series $$ F(s) = \sum_{\substack{n\geq 1\\ \text{$n$ is good}}} \frac{2^{\omega(n)}}{n^s}. $$ This factors nicely into $$ F(s) = \zeta(s)G(s), $$ where $$ G(s) = \prod_{p\equiv \pm 1 \pmod{8}} (1 + p^{-s}) \times \prod_{p\not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod{8}} (1-p^{-s}) = \frac{1-2^{-s}}{1-2^{-2s}}\frac{L(s,\chi_8)}{\zeta(2s)}. $$ Here, $\chi_8$ is the Dirichet character modulo $8$ that sends $1,7 \mapsto 1$ and $3,5 \mapsto -1$ . I guess I should say $\zeta(s)$ is Riemann's zeta function. (Without the restriction to $n$ being good, the series $F(s)$ would have factored into $\zeta(s)^2/\zeta(2s)$ .) If I understand correctly, the Dirichlet series $G(s)$ converges on $\mathrm{Re}(s) \geq 1/2$ (the tricky part is that $1/\zeta(s)$ converges at $s = 1$ , which is related to the prime number theorem) and so $G(s) = \sum b_n/n^s$ has partial sums that satisfy $\sum_{n\leq t} b_n = o(\sqrt{t})$ . Then, using $F(s) = \zeta(s)G(s)$ , I used the hyperbola principle (my most advanced trick, to be honest) to see that $$ D(t) = G(1) t + o(t^{3/4}). $$ (If I haven't made any mistake, which is a big iff...). The value of $G(1)$ can be calculated to be $\frac{2\sqrt{2}\log(1+\sqrt{2})}{\pi^2}$ using the famous formula for $\zeta(2)$ and the evaluation of $L(1,\chi_8)$ either by the class number formula or just doing it by hand. For what it's worth, I plotted $D(t) - ct$ for $t \leq 20000$ (first plot) and $t \leq 100,000$ (second plot) and, well, the difference looks small, way better than just $o(t^{3/4})$ but not as small as $O(1)$ ...

The question is as follows: A positive integer number N is divisible by 2020. All its digits are different and if any two of them are swapped, the resulting number is not divisible by 2020. How many digits can such a number N have? Sergey Tokarev My attempt Let $n$ be the number of digits of $N$ . I initially noticed that $4 \leq n \leq 10$ , since for all digits of $N$ to be distinct we can have at most $10$ digits. This gave me the impression that this problem could be solved by investigating each of these cases. Let us first write $N$ as $2020k = 2000k + 20k$ . Let $2k$ have digits $d_1d_2\cdots d_m$ , then $N = (d_1d_2\cdots d_m)000 + (d_1d_2\cdots d_m)0$ . Case n = 4: Then $2k = d_1$ and $N = d_1000 + d_10 = d_10d_10$ , so $N$ must have a repeating digit. Case n = 5: Then $2k = d_1d_2$ and $N =d_1d_1000 + d_1d_20 = d_1d_2d_1d_20$ , so $N$ must have a repeating digit. Case n = 6: Then $2k = d_1d_2d_3$ and $N = d_1d_2d_3000 + d_1d_2d_30 = d_1d_2(d_3 + d_1)d_2d_30$ , so $N$ must have a repeating digit. This argument no longer works for $n \geq 7$ . But we do know that $d_m \in \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$ since $2k = d_1d_2\cdots d_m$ , and $N$ must end in $0$ . I used this to find numbers for $n = 7, 8, 9$ and $10$ with all distinct digits that are also divisible by $2020$ because they satisfy the observations listed above. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  n & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\ \\ \hline  N & 4981320 & 64975320 & 869753420 & 2537618940 \\ \hline \end{array} Claim: If $N$ is a multiple of $2020$ and has all distinct digits, then swapping any two digits results in a number $N'$ where $2020 \not \mid N'$ . proof . Let $N = a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_j\cdots a_i\cdots a_1$ and $N' = a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_i\cdots a_j\cdots a_1$ for any $i < j$ . If $2020 \mid (N' - N)$ then $2020 \mid N'$ . Suppose, WLOG, that $a_i > a_j$ so that $N' > N$ , then $$N' - N = 10^{j - 1}(a_i - a_j) - 10^{i - 1}(a_i - a_j) = (a_i - a_j)(10^{j - 1} - 10^{i - 1})$$ So $N' - N$ must be a multiple of $10$ . Therefore, for the claim to hold, $N'$ must not be a multiple of $4$ or $101$ , since $2020 = 2^2 \times 5 \times 101$ . We know that $1 \leq a_i - a_j \leq 9$ , thus we can safely conclude that $N' - N$ is never a multiple of $101$ . Therefore, $2020 \not \mid (N' - N)$ . Therefore, $N$ can have $7, 8, 9$ or $10$ digits and we are done. I think my solution is correct, but I don't like that I had to manually find $N$ 's for $7 \leq n \leq 10$ .

88,Cyclotomic units modulo $p$-th powers in the cyclotomic tower,Cyclotomic units modulo -th powers in the cyclotomic tower,p,"Let $E$ be the unit group of the cyclotomic field $L_n=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{p^n})$ where $\zeta_{p^n}$ is a primitive $p^n$ -th root of unity. Let $G=Gal(L_n/\mathbb{Q})$ and let $\Delta=Gal(L_1/\mathbb{Q})$ . If we let $\omega: (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{\times} \to \mu_{p-1}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ be the Teichmuller character (which we may also regard as a character to $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$ by reducing modulo $p^n$ ), then we may embed $\Delta$ into $G$ by sending $\sigma_a \mapsto \sigma_{\omega(a)}$ . In this way, $E$ is a $\Delta$ -module and $E/E^p$ is a $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[\Delta]$ -module. Define the usual idempotents for $i=0,\dots,p-2$ \begin{align*} \theta_i=-\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}a^i\sigma_{\omega(a)}^{-1} \end{align*} and decompose $E/E^p$ as a direct sum of its eigenspaces in the usual way. Now if we further suppose that $p$ is regular, then $p$ does not divide the index of the cyclotomic units in the full unit group so we may take cyclotomic units as generators for each of the subspaces. It is shown in Washington's book that when $n=1$ , $\theta_i(E/E^p)=0$ for odd $i \neq 1$ , $\theta_1(E/E^p)=\langle \zeta_p \rangle$ , $\theta_0(E/E^p)=0$ and $\theta_i(E/E^p)\cong \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ for even $i\neq 0$ . In addition, if $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ , we have that \begin{align*} E_i=\prod_{a=1}^{p-1}\Big(\zeta^{(1-g)/2}\frac{1-\zeta^g}{1-\zeta}\Big)^{a^i\sigma_a^{-1}} \end{align*} are generators for $\theta_i(E/E^p)$ and even $i$ . When $n>1$ , things are not so simple. The odd components are the same since every unit in $L_n$ is a product of a root of unity and a real unit and the odd components of real units vanish. What I am having trouble with is determining the even components. For the $n=1$ case, there was a simple, perhaps naive, guess that turned out to be true: If $E_{+}$ is the group of real units, then $E_{+}/E_{+}^p\cong (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{(p-3)/2}$ by the Dirichlet unit theorem, the $0$ -th component vanishes since $\theta_0$ is just the inverse of the norm, so the obvious guess is that the remaining $(p-3)/2$ even eigenspaces  are all cyclic of order $p$ . For $n>1$ , the $0$ -th component doesn't necessarily vanish since it isn't a norm to $\mathbb{Q}$ but a norm to the subfield of degree $p^{n-1}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ . Also, $E_{+}/E_{+}^p \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^{p^{n-1}(p-1)/2-1}$ so unless I'm completely overlooking something it doesn't seem obvious how the sizes of the components should be distributed. What I do have is a set of generators for $E_{+}/E_{+}^p$ : If $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p^n$ then \begin{align*} \zeta_{p^n}^{(1-g)/2}\frac{1-\zeta_{p^n}^g}{1-\zeta_{p^n}} \end{align*} generates the  real cyclotomic units modulo $\{\pm 1\}$ over $\mathbb{Z}[G]$ so hitting all Galois conjugates of these elements with the idempotents $\theta_i$ will give us a set of generators for the components but it will be redundant.

93,An example of $p$-divisible group from the book of Demazure.,An example of -divisible group from the book of Demazure.,p,"I have some questions when I read the book ""Lectures on $p$ -divisible groups"". Precisely, my questions are in (page 76) chapter IV, section 3: The $F$ -spaces $E^{\lambda}, \lambda\geq 0$ . the problems in summary contain computations of kernel of maps of group schemes, invariants related with $p$ -divisible groups: Dieudonné modules, Hopf algebras, height, dimension... I put the questions as follows (should be classical ones as it is just quickly mentioned in the book) with some of my attempts (please correct the mistakes I possibly made): Question 1. In page 76, $\overline{M}^{\lambda}:=\mathbb{Z}_p[F]/(F^{r-s}-V^s)$ is defined, which I am already confused with: 1.1 Maybe $\overline{M}^{\lambda}:=\mathbb{Z}_p[F, V]/(F^{r-s}-V^s, FV=p, VF=p)$ ? But this module have elements of the form, say $V^n$ with $2\leq n\leq s-1$ , which not seems not expected in the original expression. 1.2 Or maybe for some reasons we can just put $V:=pF^{-1}$ and somehow it makes sense in $\mathbb{Z}_p[F]$ ? 1.3 Remark that $\mathbb{Q}_p\otimes \overline{M}^{\lambda}$ makes ""more sense"" for me. I can look at $\mathbb{Q}_p\otimes M^{\lambda}=E^{\lambda}=\mathbb{Q}_p[T]/(T^r-p^s)$ : as $p^{-1}$ exists, hence $T^{-1}$ exists. Hence change $T$ by $F$ we can rewrite the module as \begin{align*} \mathbb{Q}_p[F]/(F^r-p^s)&=\mathbb{Q}_p[F]/(F^{-s}(F^r-p^s))\\ &=\mathbb{Q}_p[F]/(F^{r-s}-(pF^{-1})^s)\\ &=\mathbb{Q}_p[F]/(F^{r-s}-V^s) \end{align*} where $V:=pF^{-1}$ . This computation some how ""convince"" me with the statement in the book that "" $\overline{M}^{\lambda}$ is a lattice in $E^{\lambda}$ "", but still question 1 have to be answered. Question 2 (main question). In the same paragraph as question 1, it is claimed that $\overline{M}^{\lambda}$ is a Dieudonné module, precisely it is the associated Dieudonné module of the following constructed $p$ -divisible group: Let $G^{\lambda}$ be the $p$ -divisible group over $\mathbb{F}_p$ defined by the exact sequence $$ 0\to G^{\lambda} \to W(p) \xrightarrow{F^r-V^s} W(p)  $$ where $W(p)=\varinjlim(\mathbf{Ker}p^n: W_{\mathbb{F}_p}\to W_{\mathbb{F}_p})$ . In other words, the statement is: $M(G^{\lambda})=\overline{M}^{\lambda}$ (the Dieudonné module) and $E(G^{\lambda})=E^{\lambda}$ (the $F$ -space). 2.1 How to look at $W(p)=\varinjlim(\mathbf{Ker}p^n: W_{\mathbb{F}_p}\to W_{\mathbb{F}_p})$ ? Is it a $p$ -divisible group? (seems not: as I computed below, it looks not like a direct limit of finite group schemes, at least.) 2.1.1 How should I describe the group scheme $\mathbf{Ker}p^n: W_{\mathbb{F}_p}\to W_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ ? Can I describe in the following way: For $W_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ , as group scheme I may write $W_{\mathbb{F}_p}=\prod_{n\geq 0}\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{F}_p}=\mathbf{Spec}  \mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]$ . Remark that we are working in characteristic $p$ case and hence we have $p^n: W_{\mathbb{F}_p}(R)\to W_{\mathbb{F}_p}(R)$ for some $\mathbb{F}_p$ -algebra $R$ is of the form $(x_0, x_1, \cdots)\mapsto (0, \cdots, 0, x_0^{p^n}, x_1^{p^n}, \cdots)$ where $x_0^{p^n}$ is in the $n+1$ -th position. (From this, by mimic the situation in algebraic geometry, the morphism on the coordinate ring should be $f: \mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]\to \mathbb{F}_p[Y_0, Y_1, \cdots]: f(X_0)=\cdots =f(X_{n-1})=0, f(X_n)=Y_0^{p^n}$ , $f(X_{n+1})=Y_1^{p^n}\cdots$ ) hence the kernel of $p^n$ described by should be $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} \mathbf{Ker}p^n @>{}>> W_{\mathbb{F}_p}\\ @VVV @VVp^nV\\ \mathbf{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p @>{}>> W_{\mathbb{F}_p} \end{CD} which corresponds to $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}  \mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]\otimes \frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{I}  @<{}<<  \mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots] \\ @AAA @AAp^nA\\ \mathbb{F}_p @<{}<< \mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots] \end{CD} with $I=(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)$ . Hence the kernel of $p^n$ is like $W_n(p)=\mathbf{Spec}\frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)} $ and the limit is finally again $\mathbf{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]$ or maybe $\mathbf{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p[\![X_0, X_1, \cdots]\!]$ or else? 2.1.1.1 As this is not finite group, what is $\varinjlim \mathbf{Spec}\frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)}$ ? (Is it $\mathbf{Spec} \varprojlim\frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)}$ ? This may not be as in the formal group case, where the Hopf algebra is the inverse limite of the Hopf algebra of the finite group schemes. What is $\varprojlim\frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)}$ ? Can I relate $\mathbf{Spec} (1+\mathbb{F}_p[\![t]\!])$ with $W_{\mathbb{F}_p}$ using Artin-Hasse exponential?) 2.2 How could I compute the Dieudonné module of $G^{\lambda}$ ? 2.2.1 How could I compute the Dieudonné module of $W(p)$ ? Since I may try to compute it by the exact sequence $$ M(W(p))\xrightarrow{V^r-F^s} M(W(p))\to M(G^{\lambda})\to 0$$ 2.2.2 How to calculate $M_n(W(p))$ ? As $M_n(W(p))\simeq M(W_n(p))$ , hence how to compute $M(W_n(p))$ ? (Having $W_n(p)=\mathbf{Spec}\frac{\mathbb{F}_p[X_0, X_1, \cdots]}{(X_0^{p^n}, \cdots, X_m^{p^n}, \cdots)}$ , it is not clear how can I have the claimed Dieudonné module.) 2.3 Finally, with the correct Dieudonné module we can see the correct height (which is the rank of the Dieudonné module) and correct dimension (which is the dimension of as formal group). How to see the dimension is $s$ as claimed?

97,A Rational Parameterization of Multiple Simple Expressions (Or the intersection of two rational parameterizations),A Rational Parameterization of Multiple Simple Expressions (Or the intersection of two rational parameterizations),,"Context I am interested specifically in all rational values of $x$ for which $\sqrt{1-x}$ and $\sqrt{1+x}$ are rational. In general; however, I am curious if there is a method for taking any number of expressions in the form $\sqrt{n_i \pm x}$ and finding all rational values for x that ensure all of the expressions are rational. What I have tried I have tried a few different methods: Method 1 I have tried calculating rational parameterizations of both expressions individually by taking the rational point $(0,1)$ and finding the intersection between a line with a rational slope through that point and the graphs individually. For $y=\sqrt{1-x}$ I used the line $x=t(y-1)$ Plugging this into $y=\sqrt{1-x}$ I get $y=\sqrt{1-t(y-1)}$ By solving this for $y$ (and ultimate $x$ ) in terms of $t$ , I get $x=-t^2-2t$ Similarly for $y=\sqrt{1+x}$ with this method I get $x=t^2+2t$ But I have not been able to parameterize the intersection of these two parameterizations. Method 2 I have tried calculating rational parameterizations of both expressions together by combining them into the system: $$y=\sqrt{1-x}$$ $$z=\sqrt{1+x}$$ and taking the rational point $(0,1,1)$ and finding the intersection between a line with a rational slope through that point and the surface $(x,\sqrt{1-x},\sqrt{1+x})$ . By this method I get a long and messy formula that does not guarantee rational coordinates. Method 3 I have tried using the same techniques to rationally parameterize $y=\sqrt{1-x}+\sqrt{1+x}$ with a similarly messy result. Method 4 Since $x$ is rational, $x=\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are co-prime integers, the expressions above can be rewritten as: $$\sqrt{1-x}=\sqrt{1-\frac{a}{b}}=\sqrt{\frac{b-a}{b}}$$ $$\sqrt{1+x}=\sqrt{1+\frac{a}{b}}=\sqrt{\frac{b+a}{b}}$$ For these to be rational either $a$ must contain $b$ as a factor (which is impossible because $a$ and $b$ are defined co-prime) or $b$ must be a square integer $b=c^2$ . I performed a search for all positive integers in certain range that where $\sqrt{c^2-a}$ and $\sqrt{c^2+a}$ are integers to attempt to identify a pattern. The first few fully reduced fractions (where $a \neq 0$ ) that I found are: $$\frac{24}{25},\frac{120}{169},\frac{240}{289},\frac{336}{625},\frac{840}{841},\frac{840}{1369},\frac{720}{1681},\frac{2520}{2809},\frac{1320}{3721},\frac{2016}{4225},\frac{3696}{4225},\frac{5280}{5329},\frac{2184}{7225},\frac{5544}{7225},\frac{6240}{7921},...$$ The denominators (the value of $c$ , not $c^2$ ) seem to correspond directly to the ""Ordered hypotenuses (with multiplicity) of primitive Pythagorean triangles"" OEIS A020882 and the numerators to ""Common differences in triples of squares in arithmetic progression, that are not a multiples of other triples in (A $198384$ , A $198385$ , A $198386$ )"" OEIS A198438 .

Here $\varphi(n)$ is the Euler totient function. We know that there is always a prime between $n-O(n^\theta)$ and $n$ , where $\theta$ can be $0.525$ ( Wiki: Prime gap ). Under Riemann hypothesis, one can improve this bound to $O(\sqrt n\log^2n)$ . But on the other hand, there are infinite many $n$ such that $\phi(n)\geq n-C\sqrt n$ for some constant $C$ (just choose $n=p(p+k)$ where $p$ and $p+k$ are both prime; for some $k$ these $p$ are infinite). So these upper bound for prime gap don't help. So can we prove this propsition, or give a counterexample? (or give a evidence to explan why is this hard to prove, maybe?)
