(I already know the identity that $\Gamma(s)\zeta(s)=\int^{\infty}_0\frac{x^{s-1}}{\exp(x)-1}\text{ d}x$ ) I let $$f(z)=\frac{z^n}{e^z-1}$$ noting that there is a removable singularity at $0$ , and poles every $z=2\pi im$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}, m\neq0$ . As a result, I set up the following contour $\mathcal{C}$ shown below, where I would take the limit as $R\rightarrow+\infty$ and $\epsilon\rightarrow+0$ . By the Residue theorem, $$\oint_{\mathcal{C}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int_{\text{Right}}+\int_{\text{Top}}+\int_{\text{Left}}+\int_{\text{Bottom}}+\int_rf(z)\text{ d}z=0$$ Parameterizing the integrals yields $$\int^{2\pi}_0\frac{(R+iy)^n}{e^R e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y + \int^{\epsilon}_{R}\frac{(2\pi i+x)^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^x-1}\text{ d}x + \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y + \int^{R}_0\frac{x^n}{e^x-1}\text{ d}x + \int^{-\frac\pi 2}_{0}\frac{(2\pi i+\epsilon e^{i\theta})^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}-1}i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\text{ d}\theta=0$$ Since $f(z)$ approaches $0$ as $\Re(z)$ becomes large, $\int_{\text{Right}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{2\pi}_0\frac{(R+iy)^n}{e^r e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y$ should go to $0$ . More rigorously, I moved the limit as $R\rightarrow +\infty$ inside (the function should uniformly converge I think so this is legal?) and indeed it would go to $0$ . $\int_{\text{Bottom}}f(z)\text{ d}z=I$ so we can ignore that for now. I'm thinking that we possibly could use a Laurent series for $\int_rf(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{-\frac\pi 2}_{0}\frac{(2\pi i+\epsilon e^{i\theta})^n}{e^{2\pi i}e^{\epsilon e^{i\theta}}-1}i\epsilon e^{i\theta}\text{ d}\theta$ since we're taking the limit $\epsilon\rightarrow +0$ but honestly I'm not sure how. If I directly take the limit $\epsilon\rightarrow +0$ of the integrand, Wolfram Alpha tells me it's equal to $(2\pi i)^n$ , which would mean the entire integral is equal to $2^{n-1}(i\pi)^{n+1}$ , but since it's such a complicated function I'm not sure if it uniformly converges on those bounds and thus if it is legal or not... I also tried using the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality on $\int_{\text{Left}}f(z)\text{ d}z=\int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y$ where $$\left|\int^{0}_{2\pi}\frac{(iy)^n}{e^{iy}-1}i\text{ d}y\right|\le \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{\left|i^n\right|\left|y^n\right|}{\left|e^{iy}-1\right|}|i|\text{ d}y = \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{y^n}{\left|e^{iy}-1\right|}\text{ d}y\le \int^{0}_{2\pi-\epsilon}\frac{y^n}{\left|\left|e^{iy}\right|-\left|1\right|\right|}\text{ d}y$$ where the last part follows from $\frac{1}{|a-b|}\le\frac{1}{||a|-|b||}$ but this makes the denominator $0$ which is illegal so I probably did something wrong here.

Justify that there are no other analytic bijections besides those you found.,f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C},"This is a question from a previous complex analysis qualifying exam. I'm working problems to study for my own upcoming qual. I'd like to know if my solution below is correct and complete or not. Thanks! Problem: Find all analytic bijections $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ . Justify that there are no other analytic bijections besides those you found. Attempted Solution: (1) Since we're looking for analytic functions on the whole complex plane, we are considering only functions which are entire. (2) A constant function is neither injective nor surjective, so clearly it is not a bijection. By Liouville's Theorem, any bounded entire function is constant. Thus, such a bijection must have a singularity at infinity since it is analytic everywhere else. (3) The singularity at infinity must be either a pole or an essential singularity. If there is an essential singularity at infinity, then by the Great Picard theorem, in any neighborhood of infinity, the function attains every value in $C$ (with at most one exception), so these functions would be ""infinity-to-1"". Thus, not bijections. (4) Finally, we are left with entire functions that have a pole at infinity. Any such function is a polynomial (since it can be written as a power series), but polynomials of degree $n$ are $n$ -to-1 functions. Thus, the only functions that are 1-to-1 are 1st degree polynomials or linear functions of the form $f(z) = \alpha z + \beta$ with $\alpha \neq 0$ . Update to include suggestion by @Greg Martin: (5) We have shown that if an entire function is a bijection, then it is linear. It remains only to show that if a function is linear, then it is an analytic bijection. We know that any polynomial is analytic. We have that a function $f(z)=\alpha z + \beta, \; \alpha\neq 0$ is injective if $f(z)=f(w) \implies z=w$ . This is straightforward as $$ \alpha z + \beta = \alpha w + \beta \implies z = w $$ by simply subtracting off $\beta$ and dividing both sides by $\alpha \neq 0$ . Then we have that $f$ is surjective if, for every $w \in \mathbb{C}$ , there exists a $z \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $f(z)=w$ . One can see that $$\alpha z + \beta = w \quad \implies z = \frac{w-\beta}{\alpha}, \; \alpha\neq 0. $$ Thus, for any $w$ there exists such a $z$ , and $f(z)$ is an analytic bijection.","This is a question from a previous complex analysis qualifying exam.

15,Conditions and correct interpretation of Borel summation,Conditions and correct interpretation of Borel summation,,"Hello to the community. In my line of research (theoretical particle physics) it is customary to apply the strategy of Borel summation to infinite power series in order to find closed forms and/or numerical estimates. However, I have the feeling things are often not done very rigurously, so I want to see if the mathematicians here can help me understand how it works. I have a power series $R(x)\equiv\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}r_nx^n$ that I rewritte using the integral definition of the gamma function as $$R(x)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{r_{n+1}}{n!}x^{n+1}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}t^n.$$ So far so good, but now people do two things. The sum and the integral cannot be in general interchanged, so they define the Borel sum of the series as $$ R_B(x)\equiv\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{r_{n+1}}{n!}x^{n+1}t^n. $$ They are only interested in $x>0$ , so they define $u\equiv xt$ and rewrite $R_B$ as (the integration limits remain unaltered) $$ R_B(x)\equiv\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-u/x}\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{r_{n+1}}{n!}u^n. $$ The series in the integrand is referred to as the Borel transform of the original series and denoted as $B[R(x)](u)$ . In my field, this strategy is tipically used for series where $r_n$ diverges factorially for large $n$ . Since the series is (or is related to) a physical magnitude, we assume that, despite divergent, the series must constitute an asymptotic expansion of some unknown function. We perform the Borel transform of the series, sum the result up, and then perform the integral, and the result is interpreted as an estimate of the said unknown function. My questions are: When is $R_B(x)$ equal to $R(x)$ ? This is, when can the sum and the integral be interchanged? If $B[R(x)](u)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{r_{n+1}}{n!}u^n$ converges for $|u|<r<\infty$ can we still integrate the result from $u=0$ to $\infty$ ? If the original series has a finite convergence radius, how is $R_B(x)$ going to carry that information? There is an example in wikipedia on how Borel summation is applied to the geometric series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n$ . The original series is converges to $1/(1-x)$ for $|x|<1$ , and the integral returns the same expression but under the weaker condition $\mathrm{Re}(x)<1$ . It says then that Borel summation provides ""an analytical contnuation of the known result "" $1/(1-x)$ "". What does this mean exactly? Thanks in advance!","Hello to the community.

The sum and the integral cannot be in general interchanged, so they define the Borel sum of the series as They are only interested in , so they define and rewrite as (the integration limits remain unaltered) The series in the integrand is referred to as the Borel transform of the original series and denoted as . In my field, this strategy is tipically used for series where diverges factorially for large . Since the series is (or is related to) a physical magnitude, we assume that, despite divergent, the series must constitute an asymptotic expansion of some unknown function. We perform the Borel transform of the series, sum the result up, and then perform the integral, and the result is interpreted as an estimate of the said unknown function. My questions are: When is equal to ? This is, when can the sum and the integral be interchanged? If converges for can we still integrate the result from to ? If the original series has a finite convergence radius, how is going to carry that information? There is an example in wikipedia on how Borel summation is applied to the geometric series . The original series is converges to for , and the integral returns the same expression but under the weaker condition . It says then that Borel summation provides ""an analytical contnuation of the known result "" "". What does this mean exactly?

16,Maximizing an absolute value of some complex polynomial.,Maximizing an absolute value of some complex polynomial.,,"Let $ \lambda \in \mathbb{C} $ be any complex number, $ R > 0 $ some positive real. I want to find maxima of absolute value of some polynomial on the circle: $$ \max (|x-1| |x-\lambda|) = \max| x^2 - (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda | = \max|P(x)|, $$ where $ |x| = R\ $ and $\ P(x) = x^2 - (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda $ . It is not hard to find maximal value for concrete values of $R$ , but I want it as function of $R$ and $\lambda$ . I tried two things. Firstly, polar coordinates: $ x = R e^{i \phi} $ , $\lambda = L e^{i\psi} $ . After some calculations I got the following equation: $$ (L^2 + R^2) \sin(\phi) + L(1 + R^2) \sin(\phi - \psi) - 2LR\sin(2\phi - \psi) = 0. $$ We have to solve it for $\phi$ . I don't know, how to do it (neither does Wolframalpha). Secondly, I notice that if $x_m$ is the point of maxima on the circle, then $$ Arg \frac{P(x_m)}{P'(x_m)} = Arg (x_m). $$ The reason is that in other way we could step a little inside the cirle and increase the $ |P(x)| $ (it is almost obvious if you draw the picture). But that would be contrary to the maximum modulus principle ( $ P(x) $ is holomorphic). That gives us folowing: $$ \frac{x_m^2 - (\lambda+1)x_m + \lambda}{2x_m^2 - (\lambda+1)x_m} \in \mathbb{R}_+. $$ And again, I do not know, what can you do next.

30,Infinite series identity via integrating doubly connected domain,Infinite series identity via integrating doubly connected domain,,"I am having some trouble obtaining the correct answer to the following problem.  I would appreciate it if someone could point out where I went wrong in my computations. This problem occurs as exercise 1020 in A Collection of Problems On Complex Analysis by  L. I. Volkovyskiĭ, et. al. Problem: Prove that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{(n^2-3)\sqrt{4n^2-3}} = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{x\cot(\pi x)}{(3-x^2)\sqrt{3-4x^2}}\mathrm{d}x+\frac{1}{6}\cot(\pi(2-\sqrt{3}))$$ Hint:  Use the integral \begin{equation}     \int_C\frac{z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z \end{equation} over the contour $C$ bounding the doubly connected domain given in figure where the small circular arcs are centered around $z=\pm\sqrt{3}/2$ and the large circular arc is of radius $n/2$ centered at the origin.  (The book doesn't actually specify the orientation of the contours.) Attempt at a Solution: First of all, I don't believe the book's suggested radius of the outer circle is correct if you take $n$ to be an arbitrary integer, as $\cot(\pi z)$ is not bounded on $\vert{z}\vert=k$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ .  I'm also not sure why they write $\cot(\pi(2-\sqrt{3}))$ instead of $-\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})$ . The answer I obtain is close but off by a factor of $\pi$ for the last term and $2\pi$ for the integral term.  In particular, I get \begin{equation}  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}  = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{t\cot(\pi t)}{(3-t^2)\sqrt{3-4t^2}}\mathrm{d}t - \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) \end{equation} The factor of pi arises because the residues of $\cot(\pi z)$ at the integers is $1/\pi$ while the factor of two on the integral comes from the fact that integrating over the dog bone contour results in two integrals from $-\sqrt{3}/2$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ , one each from the bottom and top segments, and these simplify to a single integral over $0$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ multiplied by 4, due to the integrand being an even function. I would love to know where I went wrong! Proof: Diverging from the hint slightly, we consider the integral \begin{equation}     \int_C\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z \end{equation} over the contour bounding the doubly connected domain.  To integrate over the doubly connected domain we will use the following fact. Proposition: If $D$ is a doubly connected domain with boundary curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ oriented in the same direction and if f is analytic in a domain containing $D$ and its boundary, then \begin{equation}     \int_{C_1}f(z)\mathrm{d}z = \int_{C_2}f(z)\mathrm{d}z \end{equation} Before beginning with integration, we need to select a branch of $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ which is analytic in the complex plane slit from $-\sqrt{3}/2$ to $\sqrt{3}/2$ .  To do this we may factor the polynomial in the square root and choose a branch for each of the square roots of linear factors.  We define the branch of $\sqrt{2z-\sqrt{3}}$ to be such that $-\pi<\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}\leq \pi$ and the branch of $\sqrt{2z+\sqrt{3}}$ to be such that $-\pi<\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})}\leq \pi$ . Recall that the complex logarithm $\log(z)$ is defined as \begin{equation}     \log(z)=\log(\vert{z}\vert)+i\arg(z) \end{equation} Thus the complex square root function is given by \begin{equation}     \sqrt{z}=e^{\frac{1}{2}(\log(\vert{z}\vert)+i\arg(z))}=\sqrt{\vert{z}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}\arg(z)} \end{equation} This shows that \begin{equation}     \sqrt{4z^2-3} = \sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})} \end{equation} where $-2\pi < \arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})} \leq 2\pi$ .  We would like to show that $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is continuous across the branch cut below $z=-\sqrt{3}/2$ .  To do this let $z = -t$ where $t>\sqrt{3}/2$ and consider the points $-t+i\varepsilon$ and $-t-i\varepsilon$ above and below the real axis for $\varepsilon$ real and tending to $0$ .  For the point above we see that \begin{align}     \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{4(-t+i\varepsilon)^2-3} &= \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-t+i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-t+i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-t+i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} \\     &= \sqrt{4t^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+\pi)} \\     &= -\sqrt{4t^2-3} \end{align} For the point below we have \begin{align}     \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{4(-t-i\varepsilon)^2-3} &= \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-t-i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-t-i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-t-i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})} \\     &= \sqrt{4t^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(-\pi-\pi)} \\     &= -\sqrt{4t^2-3} \end{align} Thus $\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is in fact continuous across the branch cut.  To show that $1/\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is holomorphic in $D$ we integrate along any circle in $D$ , splitting it in half along the real line.  By continuity the integrals along the segments on the branch cut annihilate each other, and since the integrals along the half circles are 0 the integral along the whole circle vanishes as well.  Thus, by Morera's Theorem $1/\sqrt{4z^2-3}$ is holomorphic in $D$ . Let us denote the circular contour of radius $N+1/2$ as $C_N$ and denote the interior dog bone contour by $D$ .  The the above proposition shows that \begin{equation}     \int_{C_N}f(z)\mathrm{d}z = \int_{D}f(z)\mathrm{d}z \end{equation} if we traverse each contour in the counterclockwise direction.  Beginning with the circular contour, by parameterizing we see that \begin{equation}     \int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = \pi i(N+1/2)^2\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{2it}\cot(\pi (N+1/2)e^{it})}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}\mathrm{d}t \end{equation} Taking the absolute value of both sides we have \begin{align}     \bigg\vert{\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z}\bigg\vert &\leq \pi (n+1/2)^2\bigg\vert{\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{e^{2it}\cot(\pi (N+1/2)e^{it})}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}\mathrm{d}t}\bigg\vert \\     &\leq \pi(n+1/2)^2\coth^2(\pi/2)\int_{0}^{2\pi}\bigg\vert{\frac{1}{((N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3)\sqrt{4(N+1/2)^2e^{2it}-3}}}\bigg\vert\mathrm{d}t \\     &\leq  \frac{\pi^2\coth^2(\pi/2)}{n+1/2} \end{align} Thus \begin{equation}     \lim_{N\to\infty}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = 0 \end{equation} On the other hand the contour encloses the poles at $z=\pm \sqrt{3}$ as well as the poles of cotangent at $z\in \mathbb{Z}$ except for $z = 0$ .  Therefore the residue theorem shows that \begin{equation}     \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = \sum_{k=-N}^{N}\underset{{z=k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) + \underset{{z=\pm \sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) \end{equation} With this in mind we first evaluate the residues at $\pm \sqrt{3}$ , finding that \begin{align}     \underset{{z=\sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) &= \lim_{z\to\sqrt{3}}(z-\sqrt{3})\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}} \\     &= \lim_{z\to\sqrt{3}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z+\sqrt{3})\sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})}} \\     &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(3\sqrt{3})})}} \\     &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(0+0)}} \\     &= \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) \end{align} Likewise the residue at $z=-\sqrt{3}$ is given by \begin{align}     \underset{{z=-\sqrt{3}}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) &= \lim_{z\to-\sqrt{3}}(z+\sqrt{3})\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}} \\     &= \lim_{z\to-\sqrt{3}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z-\sqrt{3})\sqrt{\vert{4z^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2z-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2z+\sqrt{3})})}} \\     &= \frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(-\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(-3\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(-\sqrt{3})})}} \\     &= -\frac{\pi}{6}\frac{\cot(\pi\sqrt{3})}{e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+\pi)}} \\     &= \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) \end{align} Similarly evaluating the residues at $z = \pm k$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ we find that \begin{equation}     \underset{{z=k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) = \frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} \end{equation} and \begin{equation}     \underset{{z=-k}}{\mathrm{res}}\left(\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\right) = \frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} \end{equation} Therefore, we find that \begin{equation}     \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_N}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = 2\sum_{k=1}^{N}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} + \frac{\pi}{3}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) \end{equation} Taking the limit as $N\to \infty$ and using Cauchy's Theorem for multiply connected domains gives \begin{equation}  2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}} + \frac{\pi}{3}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) = \int_{D}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z \end{equation} Next we break up the dog bone contour into four parts \begin{equation}     \int_{D}=\int_{C_{\varepsilon}^{-}}+\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}}+\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}}+\int_{C_{\varepsilon}^{+}} \end{equation} Where $C_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $C_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ denotes the circular arcs of radius $\varepsilon$ traversed in the counter clockwise direction and centered at $-\sqrt{3}/2$ and $\sqrt{3}/2$ respectively, and $\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ are the lines a distance of $\varepsilon$ below and above the real line respectively. It is not difficult to show that the integrals along the small circular arcs $C_{\varepsilon}^{-}$ and $C_{\varepsilon}^{+}$ vanish as $\varepsilon \to 0$ .  On the other hand the integrals along the lines above and below the real axis can be evaluated as \begin{align}     \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{+}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z &=  \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\sqrt{3}/2}^{-\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi (t+i\varepsilon)\cot(\pi (t+i\varepsilon))}{((t+i\varepsilon)^2-3)\sqrt{4(t+i\varepsilon)^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \\     &= -2i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \end{align} and \begin{align}     \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{\Gamma_{\varepsilon}^{-}}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z &=  \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\int_{-\sqrt{3}/2}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi (t-i\varepsilon)\cot(\pi (t-i\varepsilon))}{((t-i\varepsilon)^2-3)\sqrt{4(t-i\varepsilon)^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \\     &= -2i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \end{align} Where we have used the fact that for $-\sqrt{3}/2<x<\sqrt{3}/2$ we have on the line above the real axis \begin{align}      \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-x+i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-x+i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-x+i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})}      &= \sqrt{4x^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\pi+0)} \\     &= i\sqrt{4x^2-3} \end{align} Likewise below the real axis we find that \begin{align}      \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\sqrt{\vert{4(-x-i\varepsilon)^2-3}\vert}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(\arg{(2(-x-i\varepsilon)-\sqrt{3})}+\arg{(2(-x-i\varepsilon)+\sqrt{3})})}      &= \sqrt{4x^2-3}e^{i\frac{1}{2}(-\pi+0)} \\     &= -i\sqrt{4x^2-3} \end{align} Putting this all together the integral over the contour $D$ becomes \begin{align}     \int_{D}\frac{\pi z\cot(\pi z)}{(z^2-3)\sqrt{4z^2-3}}\mathrm{d}z = -4i\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(t^2-3)\sqrt{4t^2-3}}\mathrm{d}t \end{align} giving in the end \begin{equation}  \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{k}{(k^2-3)\sqrt{4k^2-3}}  = 2\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{\pi t\cot(\pi t)}{(3-t^2)\sqrt{3-4t^2}}\mathrm{d}t - \frac{\pi}{6}\cot(\pi\sqrt{3}) \end{equation}","I am having some trouble obtaining the correct answer to the following problem.  I would appreciate it if someone could point out where I went wrong in my computations. This problem occurs as exercise 1020 in A Collection of Problems On Complex Analysis by  L. I. Volkovyskiĭ, et. al. Problem: Prove that Hint:  Use the integral over the contour bounding the doubly connected domain given in figure where the small circular arcs are centered around and the large circular arc is of radius centered at the origin.  (The book doesn't actually specify the orientation of the contours.) Attempt at a Solution: First of all, I don't believe the book's suggested radius of the outer circle is correct if you take to be an arbitrary integer, as is not bounded on for .  I'm also not sure why they write instead of . The answer I obtain is close but off by a factor of for the last term and for the integral term.  In particular, I get The factor of pi arises because the residues of at the integers is while the factor of two on the integral comes from the fact that integrating over the dog bone contour results in two integrals from to , one each from the bottom and top segments, and these simplify to a single integral over to multiplied by 4, due to the integrand being an even function. I would love to know where I went wrong! Proof: Diverging from the hint slightly, we consider the integral over the contour bounding the doubly connected domain.  To integrate over the doubly connected domain we will use the following fact. Proposition: If is a doubly connected domain with boundary curves and oriented in the same direction and if f is analytic in a domain containing and its boundary, then Before beginning with integration, we need to select a branch of which is analytic in the complex plane slit from to .  To do this we may factor the polynomial in the square root and choose a branch for each of the square roots of linear factors.  We define the branch of to be such that and the branch of to be such that . Recall that the complex logarithm is defined as Thus the complex square root function is given by This shows that where .  We would like to show that is continuous across the branch cut below .  To do this let where and consider the points and above and below the real axis for real and tending to .  For the point above we see that For the point below we have Thus is in fact continuous across the branch cut.  To show that is holomorphic in we integrate along any circle in , splitting it in half along the real line.  By continuity the integrals along the segments on the branch cut annihilate each other, and since the integrals along the half circles are 0 the integral along the whole circle vanishes as well.  Thus, by Morera's Theorem is holomorphic in . Let us denote the circular contour of radius as and denote the interior dog bone contour by .  The the above proposition shows that if we traverse each contour in the counterclockwise direction.  Beginning with the circular contour, by parameterizing we see that Taking the absolute value of both sides we have Thus On the other hand the contour encloses the poles at as well as the poles of cotangent at except for .  Therefore the residue theorem shows that With this in mind we first evaluate the residues at , finding that Likewise the residue at is given by Similarly evaluating the residues at for we find that and Therefore, we find that Taking the limit as and using Cauchy's Theorem for multiply connected domains gives Next we break up the dog bone contour into four parts Where and denotes the circular arcs of radius traversed in the counter clockwise direction and centered at and respectively, and and are the lines a distance of below and above the real line respectively. It is not difficult to show that the integrals along the small circular arcs and vanish as .  On the other hand the integrals along the lines above and below the real axis can be evaluated as and Where we have used the fact that for we have on the line above the real axis Likewise below the real axis we find that Putting this all together the integral over the contour becomes giving in the end","\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{(n^2-3)\sqrt{4n^2-3}} = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}/2}\frac{x\cot(\pi x)}{(3-x^2)\sqrt{3-4x^2}}\mathrm{d}x+\frac{1}{6}\cot(\pi(2-\sqrt{3})) \begin{equation}

40,Question about pinch singularities,Question about pinch singularities,,"I am reading the book ""Analytic S-matrix"" by Eden,Landshoff, Olive and Polkinghorne. In Sec.2, they discuss the different kinds of singularities of a function $f(z)$ defined as an integral of an analytic function $g(z,\omega)$ in the complex $\omega-$ plane along some closed contour $\mathcal{C}$ , i.e. $$ f(z) = \int_\mathcal{C}\, d\omega\, g(z,\omega)\,. $$ It is assumed that we know the singularities of $g(z,\omega)$ . They discuss the case of pinch singularities, i.e. those singularities that approach the contour from the opposite sides and eventually coincide. As an example, they consider $$ f(z) = \int_0^1 \frac{d\omega}{(\omega-z)(\omega-a)} $$ where the contour is not really specified. This is already strange... shouldn't they specify the contour? Their result is $$ f(z) = \frac{1}{z-a}\log{\left[\frac{a(1-z)}{(1-a)z}\right]}\,,\qquad(a>1) $$ To perform this integral, I was thinking to take the parameterization $\omega(t) = \sqrt{t} e^{i \arccos{\sqrt{t}}}$ where $t\in [0,1]$ . This parameterization actually selects the path of a semi-cicle in the upper-half complex $\omega-$ plane, running from $\omega=0$ to $\omega=1$ . The integral then can be computed as $$ f(z) = \int_0^1 dt \frac{d\omega(t)}{dt}\frac{1}{(\omega(t)-z)(\omega(t)-a)} $$ If $z=a>1$ or $z=a<0$ , the singularities of the integrand lie outside my integration path, and the integral is perfectly convergent. Under Eq.(2.1.5) of their book, the authors write the singularity at $z=a$ is only encountered on encircling one of the logarithmic singularities, so that now $\log{1}$ is $\pm 2\pi i$ instead of zero and no longer cancels the pole.

41,Writing the Real Part of Complex Integrand,Writing the Real Part of Complex Integrand,,"I'm having a hard time to understand how's Eq. $(6.73)$ become Eq. $(6.75)$ . It's taken from Numerical Methods for Laplace Transform Inversion by Cohen. Here's the problem: [...]. The basis of their formulation is, like Talbot, that the inverse transform is given by $$f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}e^{st}\bar f(s)ds.\tag{6.71}$$ The contour is deformed by means of the path $$s(\theta)=r\theta(\cot\theta+i),\quad-\pi<\theta<\pi,\tag{6.72}$$ where $r$ is a parameter. This path only involves one parameter whereas Talbot's consisted of two. Integration over the deformed path yields $$f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{ts(\theta)}\bar f(s(\theta))s'(\theta)d\theta.\tag{6.73}$$ Differentiating (6.72) we have $s'(\theta)=ir(1+i\sigma(\theta))$ , where $$\sigma(\theta)=\theta+(\theta\cot\theta-1)\cot\theta.\tag{6.74}$$ We find $$f(t)=\frac{r}{\pi}\int_0^\pi\Re\Bigl[e^{ts(\theta)}\bar f(s(\theta))(1+i\sigma(\theta))\Bigr]d\theta.\tag{6.75}$$ As you can see there, i'm confused about where the $\Re$ got from. And i have 2 speculations about this. Speculation 1 (The idea is originated from my friend, so let me rewrite what he said) Regarding the integral: $s(\theta)$ on $(-\pi,\,\pi)$ is symmetric about $\theta=0$ (i don't understand this part). So we can integrate on $\theta\in (0,\pi)$ and multiply by $2$ in the denominator of the constant (outside the integral). The factor $ir$ in $s'(\theta)$ cancels the $i$ in the constant and gives it $r$ in the numerator. Assuming $f(t)$ is a real-valued function, $f(t)=\Re f(t)$ . For Riemann integrable functions $g(z)$ , we have $\Re \int g(z)\Bbb dz = \int \Re g(z) \Bbb dz$ . Hence, since $f(t)$ is equal to an integral, we can take $\Re$ on both sides and move the real part symbol inside the integral. Speculation 2 (This is my own idea) By letting the whole integrand with $\Lambda$ for simplification purpose (i'm not performing change of variable here, just for a simplification). Then we can consider: $$\begin{align} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda &= \int_{-\pi}^{0} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda + \int_{0}^{\pi} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda\\ &= -\int_{0}^{-\pi} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda + \int_{0}^{\pi} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda\\ &= \int_{0}^{\pi} \overline{\Lambda}\,\Bbb d\overline{\Lambda} + \int_{0}^{\pi} \Lambda\,\Bbb d\Lambda\\ &= 2\int_{0}^{\pi}\Re \Lambda\,\Bbb d \Lambda \end{align}$$ The last expression is considering this property : $z + \overline{z} = 2\Re z$ , where $\overline{z}$ is the conjugate of $z$ . But i'm not really sure if i can consider the third line is valid about the conjugate? And by the way.

I did that. Shortly thereafter the function $\mathrm{sn}( \alpha \cdot z)$ is considered, where $\alpha$ is such that $\mathrm{sn}(\alpha \cdot K) = 1$ . Then, it claims that with this condition on $\alpha$ , the function $\mathrm{sn}(\alpha \cdot z)$ maps Figure $36$ a onto the upper half-plane. I can't see why this statement is true. I had some ideas but none with success, if someone could give me a light, I would be grateful. Idea $1$ : Since the function $\mathrm{sn}(z)$ is analytical, in particular, continuous, then it maps boundary to boundary, and connected set to connected set. Thus, it is enough to show that the boundary of the interior of the rectangle is mapped to the real axis, but I couldn't do it.

I came across it after some preliminary reading on uncertainty principles and harmonic analysis. Edit : I originally labelled this post ""An uncertainty type principle for entire functions"". Although it doesn't appear to imply anything about the concentration of a function near a point, there is a similar theme in the sense of establishing a relationship between the growth/decay rates of a (entire) function and its Fourier transform. It should also be mentioned that as $p \rightarrow \infty$ , $\widehat{f}$ becomes compactly supported and this result implies $f$ has growth order $q \rightarrow 1^+$ , which is one direction of the Paley-Weiner theorem. Work thus far : If we define $$f_n(z) = \int_{-n}^n \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2 \pi i z \xi} d \xi$$ then $f_n$ is holomorphic for all $n$ and the rapid decay rate of $\widehat{f}$ immediately gives us that $f_n(z)$ converges uniformly to $f(z) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \widehat{f}(\xi)e^{2 \pi i z \xi} d \xi $ , making $f$ entire.

The following plot shows these three functions with $ \gamma(x) = \mathrm{sech} \pi x $ and $a=1.5$ .

I've obtained the correct answer of $I=\sqrt{2}\pi$ below, but I would appreciate if someone could verify my proof. Let $\displaystyle f(z) = \frac{z^2+3}{z^4+1}$ ; and let $C$ be the semicircle with boundary diameter on the real line (say from $-R$ to $R$ ) in the upper half plane. Now, $f(z)$ has four simple poles at $z = \pm i^{\frac{1}{2}}, \pm i^{\frac{3}{2}}$ . The two poles at $z =  i^{\frac{1}{2}},  i^{\frac{3}{2}}$ lie on the upper half plane, and the sum of the residues of $f$ at these poles is $-\sqrt{2}i$ . So $$\displaystyle \oint_C f(z)\,dz=\int_{-R}^{R} f(z) \, dz +\int_{\text{Arc}} f(z)\, {dz} $$ So by the Residue theorem $$-i\sqrt{2}\cdot 2i\pi=\int_{-R}^{R} f(z) \, dz +\int_{\text{Arc}} f(z)\, {dz} $$ Thus $$2\sqrt{2}\pi=\int_{-R}^{R} f(z) \, dz +\int_{\text{Arc}} f(z)\, {dz} $$ I tried to show that the arc integral goes to $0$ as follows $$\bigg|\int_{\text{Arc}} f(z)\, {dz} \bigg| \le  \int_{\text{Arc}} |f(z)|\, {dz} \le \frac{R^2-3}{R^4-1} \cdot \pi R \to 0,  ~\text{as} ~ R \to \infty $$ Because $|z|^4=\left|z^4\right| = \left|z^4+1-1\right| \le \left|z^4+1\right|+1  $ So $\displaystyle |{z^4+1}| \le |z|^4-1 = R^4-1 $ , similarly $|z|^2 = |z^2+3-3| \le |z^2+3|+3 \implies |z^2+3|\le |z|^2-3 = R^2-3 $ And the length of the arc is $\pi R$ combining altogether we get $$\displaystyle \bigg|\int_{\text{arc}}\frac{z^2+3}{z^4+1} \,d{z}\bigg|  \le \frac{(R^2-3)\cdot \pi R }{R^4-1}$$ Which goes to zero as $R \to \infty$ . So the arc integral goes to $0$ as $R \to 0$ . Therefore $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{z^2+3}{z^4+1}\,{dz} = 2\sqrt{2}\pi $ so that $I = \sqrt{2}\pi$ since the integrand is even.

Therefore the limit $\lim\limits_{r\to\infty}M(r)$ exists. It is also clear that if $M(r)\to c<\infty$ then (Liouville's theorem) $f$ must be a constant.It follows that $M(r)\to \infty.$ In fact, for polynomials it is each to check that $M(r)\approx r^n$ as $r\to \infty.$ Moreover, if $\frac{M(r)}{r^n}\to c<\infty$ then using Cauchy's estimate we can show that $f$ must be a polynomial. If $f$ is non-polynomial entire function then it is clear that $M(r)/r^n\to \infty$ for every $n\ge 0.$ My question is can we strengthen it furthre? For example can we say that for a non-polynomial entire function $f,$ we must have $M(r)\approx e^{r}$ or $M(r)\geq Ce^{r^{1-\epsilon}}$ for every $\epsilon>0?$ Now coming to $m_0(r)$ and $m(r).$ We note that $m_0(r)$ is decresing and hence the limit exists, but it is not very interesting. If $f$ has any zero in the plane then $m_0(r)=0$ for all $r$ sufficiently large and therefore the limit will be zero. On the other hand, if $f$ does not have any zero and $f$ is non-constant then $f$ must go arbitrary close to $0$ by picard's theorem. It follows that $m_0(r)\to 0.$ In other words, $m_0(r)\to c<\infty,$ and $c\neq 0$ if and only if $f$ is a constant. The most interesting one is $m(r).$ Let us start with a simple case. If $f$ is a polynomial (of degree $n\ge 1$ ) then $m(r)\approx r^n$ for suffiently large $r.$ Therefore, the limit $m(r)\to \infty.$ Moreover, $\frac{m(r)}{r^n}\to c\neq 0.$ If $f$ is not a polynomial and $f$ does not have a zero then it is very similar to $m_0(r)$ and $m(r)\to 0.$ In general, for a non-polynomial entire function $f,$ we know that the infinity is an essential singularity. In particular, there exists a sequence $z_n\to \infty$ such that $|f(z_n)|\to 0.$ This tells us that $m(|z_n|)\to 0.$ In particular, if $\lim m(r)$ exists, then it must be $0.$ But, I am not able to establish the existence of limit of $m(r).$ Does the limit $\lim\limits_{r\to \infty}m(r)$ always exist? Can we make a more refined statement about the behavior of $m(r)?$ For example, if $f$ has $n$ zeroes in the complex plane can we say that $m(r)\to 0$ like $r^{-n}?$ (I am not hoping this statement to be true, it is just for the illustration of the kind of statement I want to make about $m(r).$ )","Let be an entire function and define Similarly, also define I was thinking about what we can say about the functions and as For example, by the maximum modulus principle, we know that is actually increasing.

If a particular square contains points not in $R$ , we delete these points. Such partial squares will occur at the boundary (see Figure 2.7.1). We can refine this mesh by dividing each square in half again and again and redefine partial squares as above. We do this until the length of the diagonal of each square is sufficiently small.

In the derivation of the radial equation one finds that the solutions can have the following asymptotic behavior: \begin{align} \lim_{r \rightarrow 0} P(r) &= \begin{cases} r^{-l} \\ r^{l+1} \end{cases} \\ \lim_{r\rightarrow \infty} P(r) &= \begin{cases} e^{\lambda r} \\ e^{-\lambda r} \end{cases}, \lambda = \sqrt{-2E} = \frac{1}{n} \end{align} Question: To find the physical (regular) solution, which is normalizable, one usually proceeds with the ansatz $P(r) = r^{l+1} e^{-\lambda r} F(r)$ , $\lambda = \sqrt{-2E} = \frac{1}{n}$ . This leads to a Kummer differential equation for F(z): \begin{align} &z F''(z) + (c-z)F'(z) - a F(z) = 0\\ &a = (l+1)-n, c = 2(l+1), z=\frac{2}{n} r   \end{align} Solutions to this equation are called confluent hypergeometric functions or Kummer functions of the first M(a,c,z) and second kind U(a,c,z) (which is sometimes also referred to as Tricomi's functions). I am concerned with the irregular solution, which should not be normalizable at it diverges at the origin (and for large r). However, the chosen ansatz leads to negative or zero parameter $a$ . From my understanding, for example the irregular solution corresponding to the 1s-orbital $(n=1, l=0)$ should be expressible as $Q(r) := r  e^{-r}  U(0, 2, 2r)$ . But $U(0, 2, 2r)  = 1$ . Hence, this is not a linearly independent solution to $X(r) = r e^{-r} M(0,2,2r) = r e^{-r}$ . How can one construct the second linear independent solution to this parameters of the Kummer equation? I thought the choice of the ansatz, using the asymptotic behaviour, should be arbitrary (despite a particular choice might be advantageous) as in the end there is a second order ode which has two solutions. Other choices lead to equally problematic (?!) parameters, except the choice $P(r) = r^{l+1} e^{-\lambda r} F(r)$ , for which one gets $a=n+l+1$ , $b=2(l+1)$ and $z = -\frac{2}{n}r$ . For this choice I found a irregular solution, however, the negative argument is kind of problematic. Despite not being implemented in a lot of numerical packages to evaluate the U function, consulting Wolfram Alpha or for example the mpmath package in python the U function is imaginary in the regime of interest (1s: $U(2,2,-2) \approx  -0.3 + i 1.155$ ). I consulted Morse & Feshbach [1] for an expression, but the derivation of a formula for integer $c$ starts with formula (5.3.59) under the restriction $0<\phi<\pi$ which I interpreted as being defined as $z=|z| e^{i\phi}$ and, hence, the exclusion of negative arugments (?!). The formula in the end leads to something similar to DLMF 13.2.9. where I can not find such restrictions. What is the right expression for irregular function U(a,c,z) in this parameter regime of the Kummer equation?

Then it is straightforward to calculate $$ \frac{d}{dz}\theta_A(z) = \frac 1{(cz+d)^2}.  $$ Problem: Find a complex-analytic proof using $\frac{d}{dz}\theta_A(z)$ to show $\theta_A : \mathbb H^2 \to \mathbb H^2$ is an isometry. I have the following argument in real Cartesian coordinates: $\theta_A$ becomes $\theta_A(x,y) = \big( u(x,y),\: v(x,y)\big)$ , where $$ u(x,y) = \frac{(ax+b)(cx+d)+acy^2}{(cx+d)^2+c^2y^2},\qquad v(x,y) = \frac y{(cx+d)^2+c^2y^2} $$ Since $\theta_A : \mathbb H^2 \to \mathbb H^2$ is a holomorphic function, $u$ and $v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, so the differential of the map $\theta_A : \mathbb H^2 \to \mathbb H^2$ (considering $\mathbb H^2 \subset \mathbb R^2$ ) satisfies: \begin{align*} d(\theta_A)_z &= \left(\begin{array}{cc} u_x & u_y \\ v_x & v_y \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} v_y & -v_x \\ v_x & v_y \end{array}\right) \\ &= \frac 1{\left((cx+d)^2+c^2y^2\right)^2}\left(\begin{array}{cc} (cx+d)^2-c^2y^2 & 2cy(cx+d) \\ -2cy(cx+d) & (cx+d)^2 - c^2 y^2 \end{array}\right)  \end{align*} Therefore if we let $\left\{ \partial_x, \partial_y\right\}$ denote the standard coordinate frame induced by the identity coordinates $\mathbb H^2 \hookrightarrow \mathbb R^2$ , it's a starightforward calculation to show $$ \theta_A^*\breve g(\partial_x, \partial y) = 0, \qquad \theta_A^* \breve g(\partial_x, \partial_x) = \theta_A^* \breve g(\partial_y, \partial_y) = \frac 1{y^2}, $$ whence it follows that $\theta_A^* \breve{g} = \breve{g}$ , so $\theta_A$ is a Riemannian isometry.

In particular, it is not hard to see that $H^q(X, \mathbb{Z}(1))$ can be canonically identified with $H^{q-1}(X, \mathcal{O}^{\times}_X)$ . The group $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}(2))_D$ is identified with the group of holomorphic rank $1$ bundles with holomorphic connection (group structure is given by tensor product) The $\cup$ -multiplication gives us a map $$ H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}(1))_D \otimes H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}(1))_D = H^0(X, \mathcal{O}^{\times}_X) \otimes H^0(X, \mathcal{O}^{\times}_X) \to H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}(2))_D $$ In other words, given two nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions $f$ and $g$ on $X$ we obtain a holomorphic line bundle with holomorphic connection on $X$ . Though in [1] the explicit formula for this in terms of Čhech cocycles is given, I am looking for another description of the same operation. First of all, observe that each pair of functions $f, g \in H^0(X, \mathcal{O}^{\times}_X)$ define a holomorphic map $F_{f,g} \colon X \to (\mathbb{C}^{\times})^2$ . Following Esnault and Viehweg,  denote the resulting line bundle with holomorphic connection $f \cup g$ by $r(f, g)$ . Then it seems clear from functoriality reasons that $$r(f, g) = F_{f,g}^*r(z,w),$$ where $z$ and $w$ are coordinate functions on $\mathbb{C}^{\times}\times \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ . Thus, I'd be happy to understand, what $r(z, w)$ is. Since $(\mathbb{C}^{\times})^2$ is a product of two Stein manifolds, there are no non-trivial holomorphic line bundles. Therefore, the only ''interesting'' part of $r(z,w)$ is the holomorphic connection. Any holomorphic connection on trivial bundle is given by $\nabla = d + \eta$ , where $\eta$ is a holomorphic $1$ -form. So my questions are: What is this $1$ -form $\eta$ on $\mathbb{C}^{\times} \times \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ ? It seems to me, that $\frac{dz}{z} - \frac{dw}{w}$ would be nice (at least, if this is the case, it satisfies the properties of $r(f, g)$ given in [1]), however I'm not able do deduce this explicitly form Esnault-Viehweg formulas.
