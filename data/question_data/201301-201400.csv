0,Prove that a surface of revolution is regular surface.,Prove that a surface of revolution is regular surface.,,"Considering the following definitions extracted of do Carmo's book Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, prove that a surface of revolution is regular surface . Def. 1: A parametrized differentiable curve is a differentiable ($C^\infty$) map $\alpha:I\to\mathbb R^3$ of an open interval $I$ of $\mathbb R$ into $\mathbb R^3$. $\alpha$ is said to be regular if $\alpha'(t)\neq 0$ for all $t\in I$. Def. 2: A subset $S\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a regular surface if, for each $p\in S$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a map $\mathbf{x}: U\to V\cap S$ of an open set $U\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ onto $V\cap S\subset \mathbb R^3$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ is differentiable; $\mathbf{x}$ is a homeomorphism; For each $q\in U$, the differential $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^3$ is one-to-one. Def. 3: A surface of revolution is a set $S\subset \mathbb R^3$ obtained by rotating a regular  connected plane curve $C$ about an axis in the plane which does not meet the curve. do Carmo's considerations: Considering the $xz$ plane as the plane of the curve and $z$ axis as the rotation axis, let $$ x=f(v), z=g(v), a<v<b, f(v)>0,$$ be a parametrization for $C$ and denote by $u$ the rotation angle about the $z$ axis. Thus, we obtain a map $$\mathbf x(u,v)=(f(v)\cos u, f(v)\sin u, g(v))$$ from the open set $U=\{(u,v)\in\mathbb R^2; 0<u<2\pi, a<v<b\}$ into $S$. To show that $\mathbf x$ is a parametrization of $S$ we must check conditions 1, 2 and 3 of Def. 2. My attempt solution: Since $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbf x(U)=S$, then for all $p\in S$ there exist $q\in U$ such that $\mathbf x(q)=p.$ $\mathbf x$ is differentiable because is differentiable each coordinate function of $\mathbf x$, for all $q\in U$; $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q$ is one-to-one because $$\mathrm d\mathbf x_q=\begin{bmatrix} -f(v)\sin u & f'(v)\cos u\\  f(v)\cos u &f'(v)\sin u \\  0 & g'(v) \end{bmatrix},$$ so $$\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}=-f'(v)f(v)$$ and $$\frac{\partial(y,z)}{\partial(u,v)}=g'(v)\cos u.$$ Therefore $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q$ is one-to-one, because $C$ is regular [$(f'(v))^2+(g'(v))^2\neq 0$] . $\mathbf x$ is continuous  because the coordinates functions are continuous. To show injectivity, let $(u,v),(z,w)\in U$ be such that $\mathbf x(u,v)=\mathbf x(z,w)$. Then $$\begin{cases}f(v)\cos u=f(w)\cos z\\ f(v)\sin u=f(w)\sin z\\ g(v)=g(w)\end{cases}.$$ So we have $(f(v))^2=(f(w))^2$, that implies $f(v)=f(w)$ since $f(v), f(w)>0$. Therefore $$\begin{cases}\cos u=\cos z\\ \sin u=\sin z\end{cases}\implies u=z.$$ But I can't show that $v=w$. I got stuck here.

In particular I would like to understand how any given holomorphic function $\mathcal{F}$ will naturally give a special Kahler manifold. In the following I will try my best to summarize his Remark 1 (page 11). Let $V$ be a real symplectic vector space with coordinates $\{x_1,...,x_{2n}\}$ and a symplectic form $\omega = \sum_{i = 1}^n dx_{i} \wedge dx_{n+i}$. Consider $V \times V$, let's denote a coordinates on the second factor by $\{\xi_1,...,\xi_{2n}\}$ then we introduce a complex structure $I$ on $V\times V$ by  \begin{equation} I\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_{n+i}}, \qquad I\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n+i}}. \end{equation} So we can define a holomorphic complex coordinates $\{v_i = x_i + i\xi_{n+i}, w_i = \xi_i + ix_{n+i}|i = 1,...,n\}$ and the canonical complex symplectic form $\omega^c = \sum_{i = 1}^n dv_i \wedge dw_i = \omega_1 + i\omega_2$ where \begin{equation} \omega_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^{2n}dx_i\wedge d\xi_i, \qquad \omega_2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (dx_i \wedge dx_{n+i} - d\xi_i \wedge d\xi_{n+i}). \end{equation} The claim is that given any holomorphic function $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}(w_1,...,w_n)$ a complex Lagrangian submanifold $M = \{z_i = \partial\mathcal{F}/\partial w_i\} \subset V\times V$ is special   Kahler with complex structure $I|_M$. According to the paper this follows since $\omega^c|_M = 0 \implies \omega_i|_M = 0, i = 1,2$ hence $M$ is bi-Lagrangian, then ""From Theorem 2 this is all we need for a special Kahler manifold"" (page 12). I'm having a difficult time understanding this because Theorem 2 (page 7) also required that $M\subset V\times V$ is transversal to two projections onto $V$ in addition to the bi-Lagrangian condition. I interpreted the transversal condition as the two projections of $M$ are surjective to $V$, which seems to be quite an important part in proving Theorem 2. However I don't see why \begin{equation}  M = \Big\{v_i = \frac{\partial \mathcal{F}}{\partial w_i}\Big\} = \Big\{x_i = \frac{\partial \Re \mathcal{F}}{\partial \xi_i} = \frac{\partial \Im \mathcal{F}}{\partial x_{n+i}},\ \xi_{n+i} = \frac{\partial \Im \mathcal{F}}{\partial \xi_i} = -\frac{\partial \Re \mathcal{F}}{\partial x_{n+i}}\Big\} \end{equation} would satisfies such condition for an arbitrary $\mathcal{F}$. For example I could take $\mathcal{F} = 0$ then obviously $x_i$ and $\xi_{n+i}$ would be fixed and transversality condition would failed.

Or, if not every holomorphic functions $\mathcal{F}$ would yield a special Kahler Lagrangian then what is a criterion to determine which $\mathcal{F}$ would works?

A symplectic manifold is a (real) manifold equipped with a closed non-degenerate 2-form, or equivalently an integrable $\text{Sp}(2n, \mathbb{R})$-structure.

For $(m,n) \in M \times N$ and $V \in T_mM$, $W \in T_nN$ we have (remember $T(M\times N) \simeq TM \times TN$): $$ df_{(m,n)}(V,W) = df_{(m,n)}(V,0)+df_{(m,n)}(0,W) \\ = d\left( f \mid_{M \times \{n\}} \right)(W,0)+d\left( f \mid_{\{m\} \times N} \right)(0,W). $$ In the case of $Ad$: $$\frac{d}{dt} Ad (\gamma(t)) V(t) \\ = d Ad_{(\gamma(t),V(t))} (\gamma \times V)'(t) \\ = d Ad_{(\gamma(t),V(t))} (\gamma \times const)'(t) + d Ad_{(\gamma(t),V(t))} (const \times V)'(t) \\ = \frac{d}{ds} \mid_{s=t} Ad (\gamma (s)) V(t) + \frac{d}{ds} \mid_{s=t} Ad (\gamma (t)) V(s) \\ = \frac{d}{ds} \mid_{s=t} Ad (\gamma (s)) V(t) + Ad (\gamma(t))V'(t). $$ But why is $\frac{d}{ds} \mid_{s=t} Ad (\gamma (s)) V(t)=ad (dL_{\gamma^{-1}(t)} \gamma'(t)) V(t)$?

What did I do wrong? $\large\textbf{The following was added to the original question following levap's answer.}$ We have $$\omega_{12}=\langle\nabla_{e_{1}}e_{1},e_{2}\rangle e^{1}+\langle\nabla_{e_{2}}e_{1},e_{2}\rangle e^{2}$$ and $$\nabla_{e_{1}}e_{1}=\Gamma_{11}^{1}e_{1}+\Gamma_{11}^{2}e_{2},\quad\nabla_{e_{2}}e_{1}=\Gamma_{12}^{1}e_{1}+\Gamma_{12}^{2}e_{2}.$$ We have $$\begin{gather*}\Gamma_{11}^{1}=\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}+\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}\bigg)+\frac{1}{2}g^{12}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}+\frac{\partial g_{21}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{2}}\bigg)\\ \Gamma_{11}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}g^{21}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}+\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{1}}\bigg)+\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}+\frac{\partial g_{21}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{2}}\bigg)\\ \Gamma_{12}^{1}=\frac{1}{2}g^{11}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}\bigg)+\frac{1}{2}g^{12}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial g_{22}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{2}}\bigg)\\ \Gamma_{12}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}g^{21}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{11}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{1}}\bigg)+\frac{1}{2}g^{22}\bigg(\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial g_{22}}{\partial x^{1}}-\frac{\partial g_{12}}{\partial x^{2}}\bigg)\end{gather*}$$ and $$g=\begin{pmatrix}1&\cos(\alpha(x,y))\\ \cos(\alpha(x,y))&1\end{pmatrix},\quad g^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{1-\cos^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}&\frac{-\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{1-\cos^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}\\\frac{-\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{1-\cos^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}&\frac{1}{1-\cos^{2}(\alpha(x,y))} \end{pmatrix}.$$ The Christoffel symbols turn out to be $$\Gamma_{11}^{1}=\frac{\cos(\alpha(x,y))\alpha_{x}}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))},\quad\Gamma_{11}^{2}=\frac{-\alpha_{x}}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))},\quad\Gamma_{12}^{1}=0,\quad\Gamma_{12}^{2}=0.$$ So I got $$\nabla_{e_{1}}e_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}\bigg(\frac{\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))}+\frac{\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{\sin^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}\bigg)\alpha_{x}\\\frac{-\alpha_{x}}{\sin^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}\end{pmatrix},\quad\nabla_{e_{2}}e_{1}=0$$ and $\displaystyle\omega_{12}=\bigg\langle\begin{pmatrix}\bigg(\frac{\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))}+\frac{\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{\sin^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}\bigg)\alpha_{x}\\\frac{-\alpha_{x}}{\sin^{2}(\alpha(x,y))}\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}\frac{-\cos(\alpha(x,y))}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))}\\\frac{1}{\sin(\alpha(x,y))}\end{pmatrix}\bigg\rangle(dx+\cos(\alpha(x,y))dy)=\frac{-\alpha_{x}}{\sin(\alpha)}dx-\frac{\alpha_{x}\cos(\alpha)}{\sin(\alpha)}dy.$ By taking exterior derivative, I got $$d\omega_{12}=\frac{1}{\sin^{2}(\alpha)}\bigg(\alpha_{xy}\sin(\alpha)-\alpha_{x}\alpha_{y}\cos(\alpha)-\alpha_{xx}\cos(\alpha)\sin(\alpha)+\alpha_{x}^{2}\sin^{2}(\alpha)-\alpha_{x}^{2}\cos^{2}(\alpha)\bigg)dx\wedge dy$$ but $Ke^{1}\wedge e^{2}=K\sin(\alpha)dx\wedge dy$, so I don't get $\displaystyle K=\frac{-\alpha_{xy}}{\sin\alpha}$.

Here is what I get ($A^i_{\,;l}$ denoting covariant derivative): $$A^i_{\,;l} = \frac{\partial A^i}{\partial x^l}+\Gamma^i_{\,kl}A^k =  \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^l}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{'m}} \left(A^{'n} \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'n}} \right) + \Gamma^i_{\,kl} A^{'n}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial x^{'n}} =\\ =\frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^l}  \frac{\partial A^{'n}}{\partial x^{'m}} \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'n}}+ \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^l}A^{'n} \frac{\partial^2 x^i}{\partial x^{'n}\partial x^{'m}} + \Gamma^i_{\,kl} A^{'n}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial x^{'n}} $$ On the other hand, $$ A^i_{\,;l} = A^{'m}_{\enspace;n}\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{l}} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{l}} \frac{\partial A^{'m}}{\partial x^{'n}} + \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{l}} \Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace nk} A^{'k}$$ From here I get, as far as $A^{'n}$ can be any vector, $$\frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^l}A^{'n} \frac{\partial^2 x^i}{\partial x^{'n}\partial x^{'m}} + \Gamma^i_{\,kl} A^{'n}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial x^{'n}} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{l}} \Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace nk} A^{'k} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'k}}{\partial x^{l}} \Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace kn} A^{'n} \\ \Gamma^i_{\,kl} \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial x^{'n}} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial x^{'k}}{\partial x^{l}} \Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace kn} - \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^l} \frac{\partial^2 x^i}{\partial x^{'n}\partial x^{'m}} \\ \Gamma^{i}_{\,kl} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}} \frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{k}} \frac{\partial x^{'k}}{\partial x^{l}}\Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace,nk} - \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial^2 x^{'m}}{\partial x^{k}\partial x^{l}}$$ Meanwhile, if I express $A^{'m}_{\enspace;n}$ through $A^{i}_{\,;l}$ I get a different result: $$ A^{'m}_{\enspace;n} = \frac{\partial A^{'m}}{\partial x^n}+\Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace nk} A^{'k} = ...  =\frac{\partial x^{r}}{\partial x^{'n}}  \frac{\partial A^{i}}{\partial x^{r}} \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^{i}}+ A^{i}\frac{\partial x^{r}}{\partial x^{'n}} \frac{\partial^2 x^{'m}}{\partial x^{i}\partial x^{r}} + \Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace nk}A^{i} \frac{\partial x^{'k}}{\partial x^{i}}  \\   A^{'m}_{\enspace;n} = A^{i}_{\,;l}\frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^{i}}\frac{\partial x^{l}}{\partial x^{'n}} = \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^{i}}\frac{\partial x^{l}}{\partial x^{'n}} \frac{\partial A^{i}}{\partial x^{l}} + \frac{\partial x^{'m}}{\partial x^{p}}\frac{\partial x^{l}}{\partial x^{'n}} \Gamma^{p}_{\enspace li} A^{i} \\  \Gamma^{i}_{\,kl} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}} \frac{\partial x^{'n}}{\partial x^{k}} \frac{\partial x^{'k}}{\partial x^{l}}\Gamma^{'m}_{\enspace,nk} + \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^{'m}}\frac{\partial^2 x^{'m}}{\partial x^{k}\partial x^{l}}$$ I know that the correct formula is the second one.

This definition turns out (after some calculations) to be  \begin{equation} {\rm div}_M(f(x))  = (\nabla_M f(x)) \cdot 1_M = {\rm div}(f(x)) - \frac{\mu}{||\mu||} \cdot \left( (\nabla_x f(x)) \frac{\mu}{||\mu||} \right) \end{equation} Is this the correct definition of the divergence on a manifold? This idea is for me geometrically intuitive but from a physical point of view I don't like it since singular points (wells and sinks) on the manifold for which the original divergence vanishes may not be identified as singular points on the manifold. I am aware that playing on a manifold of a bigger space inevitably will be blind to information orthogonal to it, but such a loss of information somehow troubles me.",,"['differential-geometry', 'manifolds']"

So the basis of $T_eG$ acts on $C^\infty(G)$ by   $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\right)_e(f) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{\varphi(e)} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\bigg|_{(2\pi,0,0)}$$   where $f\in C^\infty(M)$. Questions: Is the above right? How can I continue from here (after making any corrections from question 1.).",,"['differential-geometry', 'lie-groups', 'lie-algebras', 'smooth-manifolds']"

(b) Another is by Penrose that $\alpha-$plane is a two-complex-dimensional locus of points in $CM$ which is incident to $Z$ and also it's self-dual. I am confused if the two versions are different. (1) Are the two definitions mean the same thing? i.e., every point of the projective complex plane in (a) is incident to $Z$ as defined in (b)? (2) Is the definition by Penrose in (b) a subset of the former in (a), so that only a subset of the points of the $\alpha-$plane in (a) is self-dual? Since according to (a), the $\alpha-$plane is a PROJECTIVE complex plane for any point $Z \in PT$.
