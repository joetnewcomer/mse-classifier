For the second function a limit does exist. As x approaches very small negative values the term $\frac{1}{x}$ approaches negative infinity. So it follows that $\lim_{x \to 0^-}e^{\frac{1}{x}} = e^{-\infty} = 0.$ However all of these statements are based on intuition and are not formal.

However I don't know if this is even the right approach in this case. For the second function I get stuck at the same point. Is it suggestive to even use the epsilon-delta proof for these kind of functions or is there some completely different solution path that is more suitable.","I have been given the following task: Determine whether a limit exists and if so determine it. I need to analyze the following two functions. I know for a fact that a limit for the first function does not exist because for very small positiv values the term approaches infinity. For the second function a limit does exist. As x approaches very small negative values the term approaches negative infinity. So it follows that However all of these statements are based on intuition and are not formal.  I tried to use the epsilon-delta proof in order to show a limit does or doesn't exist. For the first function I tried using a contradiction in order to show a limit does not exist. So suppose a limit does exist and . If than there exists a , so that with . But I don't know how to continue from here. Because normally in an epsilon-delta proof I would now try to find a starting with the term and by using equivalent transformation getting to the term . However I don't know if this is even the right approach in this case. For the second function I get stuck at the same point.

But when I tried to prove it, I used a different approach. Can someone please verify my work? Thank you and any critic is highly appreciated! It's a proven fact that $X$ is a countable set if and only if $\exists f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ surjective. Therefore if $X$ is not a countable set then $\nexists f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ . Since $X$ is infinite, it can be a (1) countable infinite set of an (2) uncountable infinite set. (1) is trivial, since $X \subset X$ , the theorem is proved for this case. (2) $X$ is an uncountable infinite set. We can conclude by our previous statement that $\nexists f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ surjective. Therefore, for every function that maps $\mathbb{N}$ to $X$ there'll be elements of $X$ that is not image of any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let's define a set of those elements: $$ S:= \{x \in X | f(n) \neq x \text{ } \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \} $$ Now we can build a surjective function: $$ F:=f|_{f^{-1}(X\setminus S)} : f^{-1}(X \setminus S) \subset \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow X \setminus S $$ And by axiom of choice we can change the domain of $F$ by selecting for every $x \in X \setminus S$ only one element of $f^{-1}(X \setminus S)$ . That'll make $F$ a bijective function. Let $\overline{F}$ be that modified version of $F$ and $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ be the modified version $f^{-1}(X \setminus S)$ . Now we have: $$ \overline{\mathbb{N}} \subset f^{-1}(X \setminus S) \subset \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{N} \\ \overline{F} : \overline{\mathbb{N}} \longrightarrow X \setminus S $$ It's also a proven fact that every subset of a countable set is countable. Since $\mathbb{N}$ is countable, then $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ is countable. By definition of countable set, we know that $\exists g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{N}}$ bijective. Finally we can create a composition of functions to make a map from $\mathbb{N}$ to $X \setminus S$ : $$ h := \overline{F} \circ g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X \setminus S $$ Since the composition of bijective functions is bijective, $h$ is also bijective and therefore $X\setminus S \subset X$ is countable.","I've seen a constructive proof based on induction that is awesome.

The number of components never changes when we change the basis of a finite-dimensional vector space. Why does the number of components change here?",,"['linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'functions', 'change-of-basis']"
99,Domain of square root of a fraction with variables in the denominator and numerator,Domain of square root of a fraction with variables in the denominator and numerator,,"I've been playing around with function $$f(x)=\sqrt{\frac{x+2}{x+1}}$$ I tried to find its domain, and I did so with finding the interval in which this applies $${({x\geq-2}\wedge{x\gt-1})}\vee{({x\leq-2}\wedge{x\lt-1})}$$ which in turn gave this domain $$D(f)\in{(-\infty;-2>\cup{(-1;\infty)}}$$ (I am using standard Czech notation which differs from anglosaxon, in intervals we use <,> instead of [,]) Now all is well and fine, however, I thought to myself: ""I should be able to apply this identity $\sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}=\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}$ and the domain should not change."" Now when I solved for the domain of $f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{x+2}}{\sqrt{x+1}}$, the domain turned out to be only $$D(f)\in(-1;\infty)$$ which I know is wrong. Upon further investigation I was able to get the other interval with $f(x)=\frac{\sqrt{-(x+2)}}{\sqrt{-(x+1)}}$ and get $$D(f)\in{(-\infty;-2>}$$ Now comes the question, had I not known the first way which i referenced of finding the domain and only used the identity with distributed square roots and then not checked the result. How would I have known that that was not the complete solution  and that I should have also used the equation with negative polynomials under the square roots. Is there some rule that I am missing or something?
