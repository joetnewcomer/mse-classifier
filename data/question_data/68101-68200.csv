My solution goes like this: First, we observe, that a pair can have gcd $d=2$ if both the numbers are even. It is easy to see that, any two even numbers paired up, has $d=2$ (We consider the gcd to be $d$ ), except the pair, $(4,8)$ which has $d=4.$ Now, the odd numbers in the given set are $\{3,5,7,9\}$ and the even numbers in the given set are $\{2,4,6,8\}.$ Now, if we choose any two odd numbers to form a pair, it is possible as all the conditions are satisfied. Now, the thing is, if we want to have all the pairs constituted of only odd numbers, now,this is absurd as, we have only $4$ odd numbers and the maximum possible pairs that can be made with them is $2.$ Now, if we have these maximum number of odd pairs,i.e $2$ odd pairs then, we have to build another two pairs with only the even numbers.

Thus, having $2$ odd pairs, is not feasible. Thus, we can have, atmost one odd pair. So now we have two cases: Case 1: There are no odd pairs in the 4 pairs and Case 2: One odd pair is there. In the former case, we can build the pairs,  either with an odd and even number i.e $(odd,even)$ and  we might take the pair $(4,8)$ as one of the 4 pairs. Here, we have, two subcases. Subcase 1: We have all the 4 pairs of the form $(odd,even).$ The number of ways, this can be done is: We first, choose an odd number and an even number and then continue the process with the remaining numbers i.e $\frac{\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}\binom{1}{1}}{4!}$ ways. Next, subcase is the case, when some pairs are of the form $(odd,even)$ and we have $(4,8)$ as one pair. Thus, we need to choose 3 pairs, of the form $(odd,even)$ . This case is not possible as we won't have  any even number left, to create the 4th pair. Now, this completes case 1. For case 2, we have two subcases as well. Subcase 1: Out of the to be chosen 3 pairs, all are of the form $(odd,even)$ and Subcase 2: We have $(4,8)$ as one pair decided and the rest are of the form $(odd,even).$ Now, Subcase 1, is not possible, since, we dont have any odd number left to form 4th pair. As for subcase 2, we have to choose 2 pairs. This can be done in $\frac{\binom{2}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}\binom{1}{1}}{2!}$ ways. Thus, the total number of ways is : $\frac{\binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{3}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}\binom{1}{1}}{4!}$$+\frac{\binom{2}{1}\binom{2}{1}\binom{1}{1}\binom{1}{1}}{2!}.$ Is the above solution correct?

It is easy to see that, any two even numbers paired up, has (We consider the gcd to be ), except the pair, which has Now, the odd numbers in the given set are and the even numbers in the given set are Now, if we choose any two odd numbers to form a pair, it is possible as all the conditions are satisfied. Now, the thing is, if we want to have all the pairs constituted of only odd numbers, now,this is absurd as, we have only odd numbers and the maximum possible pairs that can be made with them is Now, if we have these maximum number of odd pairs,i.e odd pairs then, we have to build another two pairs with only the even numbers.

64,Is there a bijection of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with itself such that the forward map is connected but the inverse is not?,Is there a bijection of  with itself such that the forward map is connected but the inverse is not?,\mathbb{R}^n,"Let $(X,\tau), (Y,\sigma)$ be two topological spaces. We say that a map $f: \mathcal{P}(X)\to \mathcal{P}(Y)$ between their power sets is connected if for every $S\subset X$ connected, $f(S)\subset Y$ is connected. Question : Assume $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bijection, where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is equipped with the standard topology. Does the connectedness of (the induced power set map) $f$ imply that of $f^{-1}$ ? Full disclosure: I've now crossposted the question on MO . Various remarks If we remove the bijection requirement then the answer is clearly ""no"". For example, $f(x) = \sin(x)$ when $n = 1$ is a map whose forward map preserves connectedness but the inverse map does not. With the bijection, it holds true in $n = 1$ . But this is using the order structure of $\mathbb{R}$ : a bijection that preserves connectedness on $\mathbb{R}$ must be monotone. As a result of the invariance of domain theorem if either $f$ or $f^{-1}$ is continuous, we must have that $f$ is a homeomorphism, which would imply that both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ must be connected. (See Is bijection mapping connected sets to connected homeomorphism? which inspired this question for more about this.) Invariance of domain, in fact, asserts a positive answer to the following question which is very similar in shape and spirit to the one I asked above: Assume $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bijection, where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is equipped with the standard topology. Does the fact that $f$ is an open map imply that $f^{-1}$ is open? Some properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$ must factor in heavily in the answer. If we replace the question and consider, instead of self-maps of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard topology to itself, self-maps of some arbitrary topological space, it is easy to make the answer go either way. For example, if the topological space $(X,\tau)$ is such that there are only finitely many connected subsets of $X$ (which would be the case if $X$ itself is a finite set), then by the cardinality argument we have that the answer is yes, $f^{-1}$ must also be connected. On the other hand, one can easily cook up examples where the answer is no; a large number of examples can be constructed as variants of the following: let $X = \mathbb{Z}$ be equipped with the topology generated by: $$ \{\mathbb{N}\} \cup \{ \{k\} \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \mathbb{N} \} $$ Then the map $k \mapsto k+\ell$ for any $\ell > 0$ maps connected sets to connected sets, but its inverse $k\mapsto k-\ell$ can map connected sets to disconnected ones. Working a bit harder one can construct in similar vein examples which are Hausdorff.","Let be two topological spaces.

Invariance of domain, in fact, asserts a positive answer to the following question which is very similar in shape and spirit to the one I asked above: Assume is a bijection, where is equipped with the standard topology. Does the fact that is an open map imply that is open? Some properties of must factor in heavily in the answer. If we replace the question and consider, instead of self-maps of with the standard topology to itself, self-maps of some arbitrary topological space, it is easy to make the answer go either way. For example, if the topological space is such that there are only finitely many connected subsets of (which would be the case if itself is a finite set), then by the cardinality argument we have that the answer is yes, must also be connected. On the other hand, one can easily cook up examples where the answer is no; a large number of examples can be constructed as variants of the following: let be equipped with the topology generated by: Then the map for any maps connected sets to connected sets, but its inverse can map connected sets to disconnected ones.

Whether that is true or not, it's my favourite theorem (so far) and I'd love to see some applications that confirm its neatness and/or power. Here's the theorem (with proof) and two applications: (Baire) A non-empty complete metric space $X$ is not a countable union of nowhere dense sets. Proof: Let $X = \bigcup U_i$ where $\mathring{\overline{U_i}} = \varnothing$. We construct a Cauchy sequence as follows: Let $x_1$ be any point in $(\overline{U_1})^c$. We can find such a point because $(\overline{U_1})^c \subset X$ and $X$ contains at least one non-empty open set (if nothing else, itself) but $\mathring{\overline{U_1}} = \varnothing$ which is the same as saying that $\overline{U_1}$ does not contain any open sets hence the open set contained in $X$ is contained in $\overline{U_1}^c$. Hence we can pick $x_1$ and $\varepsilon_1 > 0$ such that $B(x_1, \varepsilon_1) \subset (\overline{U_1})^c \subset U_1^c$. Next we make a similar observation about $U_2$ so that we can find $x_2$ and $\varepsilon_2 > 0$ such that $B(x_2, \varepsilon_2) \subset \overline{U_2}^c \cap B(x_1, \frac{\varepsilon_1}{2})$. We repeat this process to get a sequence of balls such that $B_{k+1} \subset B_k$ and a sequence $(x_k)$ that is Cauchy. By completeness of $X$, $\lim x_k =: x$ is in $X$. But $x$ is in $B_k$ for every $k$ hence not in any of the $U_i$ and hence not in $\bigcup U_i = X$. Contradiction. $\Box$ Here is one application (taken from here ): Claim: $[0,1]$ contains uncountably many elements. Proof: Assume that it contains countably many. Then $[0,1] = \bigcup_{x \in (0,1)} \{x\}$ and since $\{x\}$ are nowhere dense sets, $X$ is a countable union of nowhere dense sets. But $[0,1]$ is complete, so we have a contradiction. Hence $X$ has to be uncountable. And here is another one (taken from here ): Claim: The linear space of all polynomials in one variable is not a Banach space in any norm.

In $\mathbb{R}^n$ the compact sets are those that are closed and bounded, however the guy who answered this question and had his answer accepted says that compactness is some analogue of finiteness .  In my intuitive view of finiteness, only boundedness would suffice to say that a certain subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is in some sense ""finite"". On the other hand there's the other definition of compactness (in terms of covers) which is the one I really need to work with and I cannot see how that definition implies this intuition on finiteness. To prove a set is compact I know they must show that for every open cover there's a finite subcover; the problem is that I can't see intuitively how one could show this for every cover . Also when trying to disprove compactness the books I've read start presenting strange covers that I would have never thought about.

In the compact sets are those that are closed and bounded, however the guy who answered this question and had his answer accepted says that compactness is some analogue of finiteness .  In my intuitive view of finiteness, only boundedness would suffice to say that a certain subset of is in some sense ""finite"". On the other hand there's the other definition of compactness (in terms of covers) which is the one I really need to work with and I cannot see how that definition implies this intuition on finiteness. To prove a set is compact I know they must show that for every open cover there's a finite subcover; the problem is that I can't see intuitively how one could show this for every cover . Also when trying to disprove compactness the books I've read start presenting strange covers that I would have never thought about. I think my real problem is that I didn't yet get the intuition on compactness. So, what intuition should we have about compact sets in general and how should we really put this definition to use?

75,What concept does an open set axiomatise?,What concept does an open set axiomatise?,,"In the context of metric (and in general first-countable) topologies, it's reasonably clear what a closed set is: a set $F$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence of points in $F$ converges to a point also in $F$. This naturally generalises to the definition of a closed set in an arbitrary topological space using the concept of limit points... but limit points are defined in terms of open sets, which are, to me, somewhat more mysterious than closed sets. I was once told that ultrafilters axiomatise the concept of (sets of) big sets. I'm hoping here to find a similar conceptual picture of topologies defined by systems of open sets, preferably without reference to closed sets. One such explanation I've seen is that open set axiomatise the concept of nearness, which, I suppose, is fair enough at least for metric topologies. Indeed, if something is ""happening"" at points near $x \in X$, then it's usually the case that every open neighbourhood $U \subseteq X$ of $x$ contains an open subset $V \subseteq U$, $x \in V$, such that the something ""happens"" at all points in $V$. But what about non-metrisable topologies, particularly the coarse ones where there are no ""small"" open sets? Consider, for example, the Zariski topology on affine $n$-space $\mathbb{A}^n$. $\mathbb{A}^n$ is irreducible, so every non-empty open set is dense. It seems reasonable to interpret this to mean that every non-empty open set is ""large"". Indeed, if we work over the complex numbers, then in the usual metric geometry, Zariski-open sets are unbounded and have full measure, so are very large indeed, so I don't think it's fair to say that open sets are capturing the notion of nearness here. I'm also curious about the history of point set topology. When were the axioms first written down? What were the first ""non-geometric"" examples of topological spaces — ""non-geometric"" here referring to either non-metrisable topologies or topologies on sets other than sets of points of some intuitively geometric object — and were they part of the motivations for creating point set topology?","In the context of metric (and in general first-countable) topologies, it's reasonably clear what a closed set is: a set $F$ is closed if and only if every convergent sequence of points in $F$ converges to a point also in $F$.

They're available at my personal website with a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. This is a math education question that I've been thinking of when taking and teaching topology. For a few years now I've had an idea for a board game that could help teach students topology. However, I've had trouble working out the specifics, and wondered if the community would be able to help. Of course, this may be closed for being off topic, but if so, I'll post a link where we could continue the conversation elsewhere for those interested. Setup: Basically like battleship. The playing board would be squares of transparent paper (or chessboards, go boards, etc.). Players secretly place markers (which are circles) indicating where gardens are (or mines, etc.) on their paper, hidden from the other player. A card is then flipped over selecting a topology. Players then send five agents to the other player's board; the agents are points. If the points are placed directly in the garden, the player gets his opponents garden. If not, each agent has the option of moving (in a topological path) or of setting off a bomb. Bombs explode to form an open set; any agents or gardens caught in the bomb perish (so you may have to sacrifice your agents). Players describe the shape of the bomb, and their opponent tells them if they've hit the hidden gardens. At the end of the round, players gain one point for each garden they possess and lose two points for each agent lost. Possible topologies include: -Discrete topology: Bombs can take any shape, but agents cannot move. -Indiscrete topology: Agents can move anywhere, but the only possible bomb is a total nuke. -Finite complement topology: Agents can still move anywhere, but bombs can miss the agents. -Dictionary order: Most interesting if agents aren't allowed to move through each other. -Product topology: Each direction is one of discrete/indiscrete/finite complement/standard -Metric topology: In metric topology, we require bombs to be formed of metric balls. Then we have the standard metric, the square metric, etc. -Torus topology: Identify opposing edges (could do other surfaces, use orientation perhaps) -Subspace topology: Players place an overlay on their boards marking out a subset (like  topologist's sine curve, etc.) and then flip over another topology to combine with the overlay. Now, I think this could be made more interesting. Possible variants could include that agents don't find gardens when placed in them until they do a ""search"" which means they can detect gardens in a compact connected set containing them (but the test only detects if there is at least one garden, so if the only compact set in the whole space is the space itself, the test is always positive). I'm sure you all could think of many improvements and better rules. I think this could really help people learning topology for the first time.

81,Does this property characterize a space as Hausdorff?,Does this property characterize a space as Hausdorff?,,"As a result of this question , I've been thinking about the following condition on a topological space $Y$: For every topological space $X$, $E\subseteq X$, and continuous maps $f,g\colon X\to Y$, if $E$ is dense in $X$, and $f$ and $g$ agree on $E$ (that is, $f(e)=g(e)$ for all $e\in E$), then $f=g$. If $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $Y$ satisfies this condition. The question is whether the converse holds: if $Y$ satisfies the above condition, will it necessarily be Hausdorff?

Then both $f$ and $g$ are continuous, agree on the dense subset $E$, but are distinct. My attempt at a proof of the converse assumes the Axiom of Choice and proceeded as follows: assume $Y$ is $T_1$ but not $T_2$; let $u$ and $v$ be witnesses to the fact that $Y$ is not $T_2$, let $\mathcal{U}\_s$ and $\mathcal{V}\_t$ be the collection of all open nbds of $s$ that do not contain $t$, and all open nbds of $t$ that do not contain $s$, respectively.

Give $X$ the induced topology; let $f\colon X\to Y$ be the inclusion map, and let $g\colon X\to Y$ be the map that maps $E$ to itself identically, but maps $s$ to $t$.

But that's it. Can I explain it to someone with my own words ? Break it down? Absolutely not. That is why I am here to ask someone who fully understands these ideas to do exactly that for me: break it down. Go in slow motion. Show me the moves and codes behind it. Here's the definition I have for homotopy A homotopy between maps $f,g:X \rightarrow Y$ is a map $h: X \times I \rightarrow Y$ such that $$h(x,0)=f(x), h(x,1)=g(x) \in Y$$ where $x \in X$ and $I=[0,1]$ . We say maps $f,g$ are homotopic. It adds that, A homotopy deforms the map $f$ continuously to $g$ . So, I am given two sets $X,Y$ whatever they are and two maps $f,g$ that takes an element of $X$ to an element of $Y$ . I don't know if $f,g$ are bijective, only injective or surjective or whatever. No information on that. Just maps. And this ""homotopy"" is a ... ""map between maps""? And even if so, what exactly is it doing? All the explanation seems to be done with this single line $$h(x,0)=f(x), h(x,1)=g(x) \in Y$$ but no, I don't get what's happening. So $X$ has a bunch of elements $x$ , and the product space $X \times I$ gives me elements of the form $\{x,t\} \in X \times I$ . Okay. But this map $h$ qualifies as a homotopy as long as the above holds? Then why not just always define $h$ as $h(x,t)=f(x)$ for any $t \neq 1$ and $h(x,t)=g(x)$ for $t=1$ , just as how we might define a piecewise function? Then I can define this ""homotopy"" on any maps. Sure, it adds ""deforms $f$ CONTINUOUSLY to $g$ "" but how is that stated in the definition itself? I see it nowhere. Here is an example in my notes which didn't help me understand the definition, Take $X=\{x\}$ the space with a single element $x$ . Then a map $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is the same as and element $f(x) \in Y$ . A homotopy $h: f \simeq g: X \rightarrow Y $ is the same as a path $h: I \rightarrow Y$ with initial point $h(0)=f(x)$ and terminal point $h(1)=g(x) \in Y$ . A homotopy $h: f \simeq f: X \rightarrow Y$ is the same as a closed path $h: I \rightarrow Y$ . Well, first off what is a ""path""? Intuition also doesn't make sense because when mapping one element to another, how can there be different ""paths""? $x$ goes to $y$ . Done. It's not like going from England to Singapore via either Amsterdam or Frankfurt (thus different paths) is it? Unless it's a map $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ and telling me that $x \in X$ goes to $z_1 \in Z$ then to $y \in Y$ or $z_2 \in Z$ and then to $y \in Y$ , that might be different paths from $x$ to $y$ . But here, it is talking about $X$ and $Y$ only. And why is this ignoring $x$ ? It says $h: I \rightarrow Y$ ? The problem I also have is, this is labelled ""example"" but it's not specific at all. "" $h(0)=f(x)$ and $h(1)=g(x)$ "" over. So? What is this $h$ and how has it been defined? As a map, as a function of some sort? Maybe there are multiple homotopy thinkable, but then what are one or two of them? It's like saying $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=4$ . Done. Well, to a newbie, maybe secondary school kids, it might be nice to give them an example be it linear $f(x)=ax+b$ or $f(x)=x^2$ . To the eyes of the experienced, it might make perfect sense, a specific homotopy might pop out in their minds like popcorns but not in mine. It's an utter nightmare. I know this is ""abstract"" math but can not some more specific-ness be put into it? Pictures and diagrams perhaps? This is only the tip of the massive massive confusion and dumb-foundedness I am experiencing in this area of study. Maybe once it ""clicks"" it all goes down like an avalanche but so far it's nothing but counter-intuitive. Can someone please make this possible for me to digest?

86,"What's going on with ""compact implies sequentially compact""?","What's going on with ""compact implies sequentially compact""?",,"I've seen both counterexamples and proofs to ""compact implies sequentially compact"", and I'm not sure what's going on. Apparently there are compact spaces which are not sequentially compact; quick googling and wikipedia checks will turn up examples floating around; they tend to be variants of $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ with the product topology.  Here's a demonstration(?): $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ is compact by Tychonoff's theorem.  So, we demonstrate failure of sequential compactness. Choose a unique binary representation for each $x\in [0,1]$ . For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , let $f_n : [0,1]\to[0,1]$ (an element of $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ ) be the function which maps each $x$ to its $n$ -th place digit in its binary expansion. Let $f_{n_k}$ be a subsequence of this sequence. Let $x'\in [0,1]$ be such that the $n_{2m}$ -th digit is $0$ and the $n_{2m+1}$ -th digit is $1$ , for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ . Then $f_{n_k} (x')$ does not converge (it alternates between $0$ and $1$ ), and hence $f_{n_k}$ cannot converge. Thus we have found a sequence in $[0,1]^{[0,1]}$ without any convergent subsequence and so it is not sequentially compact. (Aside: this is apparently based off of an example in Steen's Counterexamples in Topology, according to http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sequentially+compact+space ) Nevertheless, there's also some proofs(?) floating around that compactness of a space implies sequential compactness, along these lines (this proof(?) is of the contrapositive): Suppose $X$ is not sequentially compact. By definition, this means there is some sequence $(x_n)$ over $X$ with no convergent subsequence. If any $x\in X$ had for each of its neighborhood $U$ infinitely many $n$ for which $x_n \in U$ , then we could define a convergent subsequence of $(x_n)$ , contradicting our assumption.  (Presumably this is done by choosing for each neighborhood a sufficiently-large-indexed term in that neighborhood.) Thus, for each $x \in X$ we can select an open set $U_x$ such that $x\in U_x$ but with $x_n \in U_x$ for only finitely many $n$ . The collection $\mathcal{U}=\{U_x : x\in X\}$ is clearly an open cover of $X$ . If $\mathcal{U}$ had a finite subcover $\{U_1, \dots, U_k\}$ then the union $U_1 \cup \cdots \cup U_k$ would contain all of $X$ but only contain $x_n$ for finitely many $n$ , which is impossible. Thus $X$ is not compact, since we have found an open cover without a finite subcover. (Aside: this proof is essentially the same as the proof appearing in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis for Thm 2.37 that infinite subsets of compact spaces have limit points.) So, what's going on here?  It can't be that what both the counterexample and the proof are telling us is correct.
