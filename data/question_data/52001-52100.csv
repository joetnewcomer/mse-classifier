If someone could help, or identify the problem (I know it's a pretty famous one) Thank you","I try to express : $\displaystyle 1+2\sum _{ k=1 }^n \cos(2k\theta ) $ as : $\dfrac { \sin\left( \theta +2\theta n \right) }{ \sin\left( \theta  \right) } $ I tried to use the exponential function : $$I=\sum _{ k=1 }^n \cos(2k\theta )  ;\quad J=\sum _{ k=1 }^n \sin(2k\theta) $$ $I+i\cdot J=\displaystyle\sum _{ k=1 }^n e^{ 2ki\theta }$ and then get only the real part, but without success. I also tried multiplying by $\dfrac {\sin(p)}{\sin(p)}$ (with $p$ an unknown variable I would determine later), but still, no success.

98,integral from 0 to $2\pi$ of $|\cos x|\operatorname{d}x$ not integrating as I'd expect,integral from 0 to  of  not integrating as I'd expect,2\pi |\cos x|\operatorname{d}x,"I drew a rough sketch of $|\cos x|$ and would guess the correct answer to this integral is $4$ because I know the area under the curve of $\cos x$ from $0$ to $\pi/2$ is $1$, and there are $4$ such areas under $|\cos x|$ between $0$ and $2\pi$. So if I rewrite the integral as ($4$ $\times$ integral from $0$ to $\pi/2$ $|\cos x|\operatorname{d}x$) I get the answer I expect. What I don't understand is why this evaluates correctly when the original form does not. Does it have something to do with the antiderivative of an absolute trig function? I've been saying it's $|\sin x|$ in this case - is this actually incorrect? What is it that I need to look out for in cases like this?","I drew a rough sketch of $|\cos x|$ and would guess the correct answer to this integral is $4$ because I know the area under the curve of $\cos x$ from $0$ to $\pi/2$ is $1$, and there are $4$ such areas under $|\cos x|$ between $0$ and $2\pi$.

99,Order of solving definite integrals,Order of solving definite integrals,,"I've been coming across several definite integrals in my homework where the solving order is flipped, and am unsure why.  Currently, I'm working on calculating the area between both intersecting and non-intersecting graphs. According to the book, the formula for finding the area bounded by two graphs is $$A=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)-g(x) \mathrm dx$$ For example, given $f(x)=x^3-3x^2+3x$ and $g(x)=x^2$ , you can see that the intersections  are $x={0, 1, 3}$ by factoring.  So, at first glance, it looks as if the problem is solved via $$\int_0^1f(x)-g(x)\mathrm dx+\int_1^3f(x)-g(x)\mathrm dx$$ However, when I solved using those integrals, the answer didn't match the book answer, so I took another look at the work.  According to the book, the actual integral formulas are $$\int_0^1f(x)-g(x)\mathrm dx+\int_1^3g(x)-f(x)\mathrm dx$$ I was a little curious about that, so I put the formulas in a grapher and it turns out that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ flip values at the intersection $x=1.$ So how can I determine which order to place the $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ integration order without using a graphing utility?  Is it dependent on the intersection values?","I've been coming across several definite integrals in my homework where the solving order is flipped, and am unsure why.
