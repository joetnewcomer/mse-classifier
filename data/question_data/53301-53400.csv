4,How many positive numbers need to be added together to ensure that the sum is infinite?,How many positive numbers need to be added together to ensure that the sum is infinite?,,"The question in the title is naively stated, so let be make it more precise: Let $\sum_{n\in\alpha}a_n$ be an ordinal-indexed sequence of real numbers such that $a_n>0$ for each $n\in\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number. What is the smallest $\alpha$ which guarantees that $\sum_{n\in\alpha}a_n$ diverges? Since bijections correspond to rearrangements of the sum, and since the $a_n$ are positive, the sum is either absolutely convergent or diverges to $+\infty$ regardless of the order, so it follows that $\alpha$ is a cardinal number. My intuition tells me that $\alpha=\omega_1$, but I can only prove that $\alpha\le\frak{c}^+$, as follows: Let $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n$ be a sum of positive reals with $\frak{c}^+$ terms, and let $s_\beta=\sum_{n\in \beta}a_n$ be the sequence of partial sums, so that $s_{\beta+1}=s_\beta+a_\beta$. Then if $\beta<\gamma$, $s_\beta<s_\beta+a_\beta=s_{\beta+1}\le s_\gamma$, so in particular, the $\{s_\beta\}$ are all distinct, and $|\{s_\beta\}|=\frak{c}^+$. If $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n=A$ is finite, then every partial sum is less than $A$, so $\{s_\beta\}\subseteq [0,A]\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, so $\frak{c}^+=|\{s_\beta\}|\le|\mathbb{R}|=\frak{c}$, a contradiction. Thus $\sum_{n\in\frak{c}^+}a_n$ is not finite. As indicated above, $\alpha\ge\omega_1$ is obvious because $\alpha$ is a cardinal, and $\sum_{n\in\omega}2^{-n}=2$ is finite, so $\alpha>\omega$. Can anyone prove that $\alpha\le\frak{c}$ or that $\alpha=\frak{c}^+$? I can't imagine any set of positive numbers indexed by reals whose sum could possibly be finite, so I lean strongly toward $\alpha\le\frak{c}$, but I don't know how to prove it.","The question in the title is naively stated, so let be make it more precise: Let $\sum_{n\in\alpha}a_n$ be an ordinal-indexed sequence of real numbers such that $a_n>0$ for each $n\in\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number.

I hope they are more than just curiosities, but I cannot really tell where, in the mathematical world, they fit, or where I could go to learn anything about them. What I know: (possibly a red herring, or running before crawling) To exclude sequences like $x \mapsto x + k \pmod p$ that are obviously periodic, the interesting examples I've seen so far have terms that are Laurent polynomials in the first two terms $a_1 = x$ and $a_2 = y$. This is even called the Laurent Phenomenon (I personally know very little about Laurent polynomials). Based on my research (primarily Fomin and Reading's notes Root Systems and Generalized Associahedra and web searches), there are certain structures called cluster algebras (or, evidently, Laurent phenomenon algebras ) that seem to have been created with these recurrence relations in mind, or as a motivation, or create them as a natural byproduct (I don't know).

17,A possible way to prove non-cyclicity of eventual counterexamples of the Collatz conjecture?,A possible way to prove non-cyclicity of eventual counterexamples of the Collatz conjecture?,,"I've been recreatively working on the Collatz conjecture for a few months now, and I think I may have found something that could potentially prove at least half of the conjecture, which is the non-existence of non-trivial cycles. $\textbf{If you want to tl;dr}$ , just check the framed equations. The first one is my conjecture, and the second one is a corollary which shows that if the conjecture is correct with all the conditions and everything, it would contradict the existence of non-trivial cyclic patterns. $\textbf{This is supposed to lead to a proof by contradiction}$ and so far, it seems to work. Otherwise, you could what I've done to get to this conjecture idea (because I'm narrating it chronologically so you can sort of get my process). I've not seen any peer-reviewed proof of their inexistence, so I guess it's still an open problem by itself. The fact is, I really think this conjecture is manageable, I just think I don't have the level required to tackle this kind of thing. Anyway, first things first, I didn't use the usual $$a_0\in\mathbb N,~a_{n+1}=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}(3a_n+1)/2&a_n~\rm odd\\a_n/2&\rm otherwise\end{array}\right.$$ but a more dynamical subsequence, which I randomly called $(e_n)$ , defined with $$e_0=\frac{a_0}{2^{\nu_2(a_0)}},~e_{n+1}=\frac{3e_n+1}{2^{\nu_2(3e_n+1)}}$$ where $\nu_2$ is the 2-adic valuation. This basically chops off all the even numbers and basically keeps the core dynamics of the sequences. First off, I had to prove by induction that $$\begin{array}{ccccc} e_{n+1}&=&3^n\left(3e_0+1+\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac1{3^k}\prod\limits_{\ell=0}^{k-1}2^{\nu_2(3e_\ell+1)}\right)\prod\limits_{k=0}^n\frac1{2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}}&n\ge1&(1)\\ &=&3^n\left(3e_0+\left(\sum\limits_{k=0}^n\frac1{3^k}\prod\limits_{\ell=k}^n\frac1{2^{\nu_2(3e_\ell+1)}}\right)\prod\limits_{k=0}^n{2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}}\right)\prod\limits_{k=0}^n\frac1{2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}}&n\ge0&(2) \end{array}$$ However, $\nu_2(3e_k+1)$ has a very chaotic behaviour for $k\in\mathbb N$ , so I had to bound it in some way or another. First obvious bound is that $\nu_2(3e_k+1)\ge1$ , since from how the sequence is defined, $3e_k+1$ is even. Hence, I deduced that $$e_{n+1}\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}\le3^{n+1}e_0+\frac{3^n}{2^{n+1}}\left(\sum_{k=0}^n\left(\frac23\right)^k\right)\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}$$ Since $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n\left(\frac23\right)^k<3$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$ , I found out that $$e_{n+1}\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}<3^{n+1}e_0+\frac{3^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}}\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}\\ \iff\frac1{e_0}\left(e_{n+1}-\left(\frac32\right)^{n+1}\right)\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}<3^{n+1}$$ Now, I need to use a bit of a trick here. I'll assume $e_0$ to be minimal. In fact, for all $(e_n)$ which doesn't get to the trivial sequence, it can be shown that there are infinitely many $k\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n\ge k$ , $e_k\le e_n$ , so this trick can describe literally any counterexample of the Collatz conjecture. Therefore, we get $$\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}<\frac{3^{n+1}}{1-\frac1{e_0}\left(\frac32\right)^{n+1}}$$ if and only if $n+1 < \log_{3/2}e_0$ . Since we know that for all $e_0\le87\times2^{60}$ , $(e_n)$ is not a counterexample, we have $$\prod_{k=0}^n2^{\nu_2(3e_k+1)}<\frac{3^{n+1}}{1-\frac1{87\times2^{60}}\left(\frac32\right)^{n+1}}$$ for all $n+1 < \log_{3/2}(87\times2^{60})\approx113.58\ldots$ Hence, we got that $$\sum_{k=0}^n\nu_2(3e_k+1)<(n+1)\log_23-\log_2\left(1-\frac1{87\times2^{60}}\left(\frac32\right)^{113}\right)$$ for $n\le112$ . So, to sum it up, we just bounded $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n\nu_2(3e_k+1)$ is bounded from above by $(n+1)\log_23+c$ for some constant $c$ . Yet, we can also derive that for all $n\le107$ , $$\sum_{k=0}^n\nu_2(3e_k+1)<(n+1)\log_23$$ (NB : The $107$ is here because $\left\lfloor(n+1)\log_23\right\rfloor=\left\lfloor(n+1)\log_23-\log_2\left(1-\frac1{87\times2^{60}}\left(\frac32\right)^{n+1}\right)\right\rfloor$ for all natural $n\le107$ ). Anyway, basically, here is my conjecture : If $(e_n)$ doesn't converge to 1 and that for all $n\in\mathbb N$ we have $e_0\le e_n$ , then for all $n\in\mathbb N$ , $$\begin{array}{|c|}\hline\sum\limits_{k=0}^n\nu_2(3e_k+1)<(n+1)\log_23\\\hline\end{array}$$ I even have some numerical evidence supporting it. With a little algorithm which basically computes, for any $e_0$ , the sum $\sum\limits_{k=0}^n\nu_2(3e_k+1)$ and checks whether or not it's below $(n+1)\log_23$ for as long as for all $k\le n$ , we have $e_0\le e_k$ . Checked all odd $e_0$ from $3$ to $29\;322\;479$ and it worked, so I'm pretty confident with that ! Now, how is this even related to the non-existence of cyclic sequences ? Well, if we assume this conjecture and using formula $(2)$ , we'd have for minimal $e_0$ and $n\ge1$ $$\begin{array}{|c|}\hline e_{n+1}\ge 3^{n+1}\left(e_0+1/3+2/9\right)\frac1{3^{n+1}}=e_0+5/9>e_0\\\hline\end{array}$$ But this means that we could only reach $e_0$ once, which is a contradiction to cyclicity if it works for all minimal $e_0$ . So basically, if my upper bound turns out to be correct for all minimal $e_0$ and $n\ge0$ (or $n\ge1$ to be cautious but anyway), this would essentially imply that there is no non-trivial cycle ! I'm putting this here so people could eventually work out a way to prove it. Obviously tried by myself, but I figured out I might not be good enough for this !","I've been recreatively working on the Collatz conjecture for a few months now, and I think I may have found something that could potentially prove at least half of the conjecture, which is the non-existence of non-trivial cycles. , just check the framed equations. The first one is my conjecture, and the second one is a corollary which shows that if the conjecture is correct with all the conditions and everything, it would contradict the existence of non-trivial cyclic patterns. and so far, it seems to work. Otherwise, you could what I've done to get to this conjecture idea (because I'm narrating it chronologically so you can sort of get my process). I've not seen any peer-reviewed proof of their inexistence, so I guess it's still an open problem by itself. The fact is, I really think this conjecture is manageable, I just think I don't have the level required to tackle this kind of thing. Anyway, first things first, I didn't use the usual but a more dynamical subsequence, which I randomly called , defined with where is the 2-adic valuation. This basically chops off all the even numbers and basically keeps the core dynamics of the sequences. First off, I had to prove by induction that However, has a very chaotic behaviour for , so I had to bound it in some way or another. First obvious bound is that , since from how the sequence is defined, is even. Hence, I deduced that Since for all , I found out that Now, I need to use a bit of a trick here. I'll assume to be minimal. In fact, for all which doesn't get to the trivial sequence, it can be shown that there are infinitely many such that for all , , so this trick can describe literally any counterexample of the Collatz conjecture. Therefore, we get if and only if . Since we know that for all , is not a counterexample, we have for all Hence, we got that for . So, to sum it up, we just bounded is bounded from above by for some constant . Yet, we can also derive that for all , (NB : The is here because for all natural ). Anyway, basically, here is my conjecture : If doesn't converge to 1 and that for all we have , then for all , I even have some numerical evidence supporting it. With a little algorithm which basically computes, for any , the sum and checks whether or not it's below for as long as for all , we have . Checked all odd from to and it worked, so I'm pretty confident with that ! Now, how is this even related to the non-existence of cyclic sequences ? Well, if we assume this conjecture and using formula , we'd have for minimal and But this means that we could only reach once, which is a contradiction to cyclicity if it works for all minimal .

20,What is $\mathcal{R}$?,What is ?,\mathcal{R},"First of all, I am asking this question entirely out of curiosity. It basically randomly popped out of my mind. So I am asking for the value of an infinite series. Let's call it, $\mathcal{R}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathcal{R}_n$ Now I will try to explain what are these $\mathcal{R}_i$ 's Let's take a 1-ball of unit length (1-volume). It's radius will be $r_1=\frac{1}{2}$ So the first term of my series is $\mathcal{R}_1=1$ Now I will turn the length of this line into the circumference of a circle or a $2$ -ball. It's radius will be $r_2$ , you can just do a little calculation and $r_2=\frac{1}{2\pi}$ And the area of this circle would be, $\pi r_2^2=\frac{1}{4\pi}$ This will be $\mathcal{R}_2=\frac{1}{4\pi}$ Now let's turn the area of this circle into the surface area of a sphere or a $3$ -ball, It's radius would be $r_3$ Again, $r_3=\frac{1}{4\pi}$ And the volume of this sphere will be, $\frac{4}{3}\pi r_3^3=\frac{1}{48\pi^2}$ This will be, $\mathcal{R}_3=\frac{1}{48\pi^2}$ In general we take an $n$ -ball whose radius is $r_n$ , then we turn the $n$ -volume of this ball into the $n$ -surface area of an $n+1$ -ball whose radius is $r_{n+1}$ . And $\mathcal{R}$ is the sum over the $n$ -volumes of these $n$ -balls with radius $r_n$ . So we can write, $\mathcal{R}=\textstyle\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}V_n(r_n)$ From this we can deduce the formula for $r_n$ Agian in general, we take an $n$ -ball with radius $r_n$ . Then we set it's $n$ -volume to equal the $n$ -surface area of an $n+1$ -ball. And we define the $n+1$ -ball's radius to be $r_{n+1}$ . From this we can calculate a recurrence relation for $r_n$ , $V_n(r_n)=S_n(r_{n+1})$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{\frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}r_n^n=\frac{2\sqrt{\pi}\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}r_{n+1}^n}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{r_{n+1}=r_n\sqrt[n]{\frac{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{2\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(\frac{n+2}{2})}}}$ with the initial condition of $r_1=\frac{1}{2}$ If we keep expanding $r_n$ using the formula then we get, $\textstyle\displaystyle{r_n=r_1\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\sqrt[k]{\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{2\sqrt{\pi}\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{r_n=\frac{1}{2(2\sqrt{\pi})^{H_{n-1}}}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\sqrt[k]{\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}}}$ So finally, $\textstyle\displaystyle{V_n(r_n)=\frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma(\frac{n}{2}+1)}r_n^n}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{\begin{align}\mathcal{R}_n=&\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{n(1-H_{n-1})}}{2^{n(1+H_{n-1})}\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{n}{k}\end{align}}$ So, $\textstyle\displaystyle{\mathcal{R}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{n(1-H_{n-1})}}{2^{n(1+H_{n-1})}\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{n}{k}}$ Here $H_0=0$ $\mathcal{R}\approx 1.0817135\dots$ $\underline{\text{My Question}:-}$ Is there a closed form for $\mathcal{R}$ ? Or maybe we can write $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of some advance function? Are there some interesting properties of $\mathcal{R}$ ? A list of the first few terms of $\mathcal{R}$ :- $\{\mathcal{R}_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ $=\{$ $\mathcal{R}_1$ , $\mathcal{R}_2$ , $\mathcal{R}_3$ , $\mathcal{R}_4$ , $\mathcal{R}_5$ , $\mathcal{R}_6$ , $\mathcal{R}_7$ , $\mathcal{R}_8$ , $\mathcal{R}_9$ , $\mathcal{R}_{10}$ , $\dots$$\}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\left\{1, \frac{1}{2^2\pi}, \frac{1}{2^43\pi^2}, \frac{1}{2^\frac{23}{3}3^\frac{4}{3}\pi^\frac{10}{3}}, \frac{1}{2^\frac{31}{3}3^\frac{17}{12}5\pi^\frac{14}{3}}, \frac{1}{2^\frac{72}{5}3^\frac{27}{10}5^\frac{6}{5}\pi^\frac{31}{5}}, \frac{1}{2^\frac{163}{10}3^\frac{179}{60}5^\frac{37}{30}7\pi^\frac{116}{15}}, \cdots\right\}}$ You can yourself find more terms by just plugging the formula in Wolfram alpha. Notice the terms at the denominator have a very weird property, they are all prime numbers to the power of some rational numbers which is really weird. The more peculiar part is that they are not random prime numbers, but the first $n$ prime numbers. So there will definitely be some involvement of prime numbers in the evaluation of $\mathcal{R}$ . Observing some patterns:- Notice that every $n^\text{th}$ $2$ terms namely the ${2n-1}^\text{st}$ and ${2n}^\text{th}$ terms have the first $n$ primes in their denominator. Also notice that when the $n^\text{th}$ prime first appears at the ${2n-1}^\text{st}$ term it is being raised to the first power and at the ${2n}^\text{th}$ term it is being raised to the power of $\frac{p_n+1}{p_n}$ . (If we say that the $n^\text{th}$ prime is $p_n$ ). I can't prove these observations, but if they are true to infinity then we can write- $\textstyle\displaystyle{\mathcal{R}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{p_n\pi^{q_{2n-1}}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}p_k^{r_{k,2n-1}}}+\frac{1}{p_n^{\frac{p_n+1}{p_n}}\pi^{q_{2n}}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}p_k^{r_{k,2n}}}\right)}$ For some rational sequence $q_n$ and $r_{m,n}$ It seems like $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, q_{n+1}>q_n$ And the greatest common divisor of the denominators of $r_{m,n}$ and $q_n$ is not $1$ , namely If $\textstyle\displaystyle{r_{m,n}=\frac{s_{m,n}}{t_{m,n}}}$ and $\textstyle\displaystyle{q_n=\frac{a_n}{b_n}}$ such that $\operatorname{gcd}(s_{m,n},t_{m,n},)=\operatorname{gcd}(a_n,b_n)=1$ Then, $\operatorname{gcd}(t_{1,n},\dots,t_{m,n},b_n)\neq 1$ for $n\gt 3$ I don't know if my observation are true to infinity or not, do they even simplify $\mathcal{R}$ , I don't know. But it increases my hope for getting a closed form for $\mathcal{R}$ . If I am able to spot more patterns then I will add it to the post. Working with the formula itself:- I hadn't really worked with the formula yet. I spent the last 2 days trying to find more patterns, I think I may have found another one but I need work on that a little bit more before I add that to the question. I am sure is the following progress or regress, but whatever. $\textstyle\displaystyle{\mathcal{R}_n=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{n(1-H_{n-1})}}{2^{n(1+H_{n-1})}\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{n}{k}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{n(1-H_{n})}}{2^{n\left(\frac{1}{2}+H_{n-1}\right)}(n-1)!!}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{n}{k}}$ Now I am going to break $\mathcal{R}$ into two infinite sums as following $\mathcal{R}=E+O$ Where, $\textstyle\displaystyle{E=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\pi^{n(1-H_{2n})}}{2^{n(1-2H_{2n-1})}(2n-1)!!}\prod_{k=1}^{2n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2n}{k}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(n-1)!\pi^{n(1-H_{2n})}}{4^{nH_{2n}}(2n-1)!}\prod_{k=1}^{2n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2n}{k}}$ Here i replaced every $n$ with $2n$ And, $\textstyle\displaystyle{O=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{2n(1-H_{2n})+H_{2n-1}}}{2^{(2n-1)\left(\frac{1}{2}+H_{2n-2}\right)}(2n-2)!}\prod_{k=1}^{2n-1}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2n-1}{k}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}^{2n(1-H_{2n})+H_{2n-1}}}{2^{(2n-1)(1-H_{2n-1})}(n-1)!}\prod_{k=1}^{2n-1}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2n-1}{k}}$ Here i replaced every $n$ with $2n-1$ . Before I do anything with these $E$ and $O$ . I want to first take care of the product inside both of them. Let, $\textstyle\displaystyle{P_{n}=\prod_{k=1}^{2n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2}{k}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{2k+1}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{2k+2}{2})}\right)^\frac{2}{2k}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(\frac{2k}{2})}{\Gamma(\frac{2k+1}{2})}\right)^\frac{2}{2k-1}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\Gamma(k+\frac{1}{2})}{k!}\right)^\frac{1}{k}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{(k-1)!}{\Gamma(k+\frac{1}{2})}\right)^\frac{2}{2k-1}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{(2k)!\sqrt{\pi}}{4^kk!^2}\right)^\frac{1}{k}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{4^kk!(k-1)!}{(2k)!\sqrt{\pi}}\right)^\frac{2}{2k-1}}$ $\textstyle\displaystyle{=\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4^k}\right)^\frac{1}{k}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{4^k}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)^\frac{2}{2k-1}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{(2k)!}{k!^2}\right)^\frac{1}{k}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\left(\frac{k!(k-1)!}{(2k)!}\right)^\frac{2}{2k-1}}$ Since, $\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{2k-1}=H_{2n}-\frac{1}{2}H_n$ And by Wolfram Alpha we have, $\prod_{k=1}^{n}16^\frac{k}{2k-1}=2^{2n+\psi(n+\frac{1}{2})-\psi(\frac{1}{2})}$ Also notice, $\frac{k!(k-1)!}{(2k)!}=B(k,k+1)$ and, $\frac{(2k)!}{k!^2}=\frac{1}{kB(k,k+1)}$ And finally again from Wolfram Alpha , $\prod_{k=1}^{n}k^{-\frac{1}{k}}=e^{\gamma_{1}(n+1)-\gamma_1}$ We have- $\textstyle\displaystyle{P_{n}^n=2^{n(\psi(n+\frac{1}{2})-2+\gamma+\ln(4))}\pi^{n(H_n-H_{2n})}e^{n(\gamma_1(n+1)-\gamma_1)}\prod_{k=1}^{n}B(k,k+1)^\frac{n}{k(2k-1)}}$ So, $\textstyle\displaystyle{E=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(n-1)!}{(2n-1)!}\pi^{n(1+H_n-2H_{2n})}e^{n(\gamma_1(n+1)-\gamma_1)}2^{n(\psi(n+\frac{1}{2})-2(n+1)H_{2n}+\gamma+\ln(4)-2)}\prod_{k=1}^{n}B(k,k+1)^\frac{n}{k(2k-1)}}$ Now replacing $n$ with $n-\frac{1}{2}$ should give us $P_{2n-1}$ which corresponds to the product inside $O$ .

So I am asking for the value of an infinite series. Let's call it, Now I will try to explain what are these 's Let's take a 1-ball of unit length (1-volume). It's radius will be So the first term of my series is Now I will turn the length of this line into the circumference of a circle or a -ball. It's radius will be , you can just do a little calculation and And the area of this circle would be, This will be Now let's turn the area of this circle into the surface area of a sphere or a -ball, It's radius would be Again, And the volume of this sphere will be, This will be, In general we take an -ball whose radius is , then we turn the -volume of this ball into the -surface area of an -ball whose radius is . And is the sum over the -volumes of these -balls with radius . So we can write, From this we can deduce the formula for Agian in general, we take an -ball with radius . Then we set it's -volume to equal the -surface area of an -ball. And we define the -ball's radius to be . From this we can calculate a recurrence relation for , with the initial condition of If we keep expanding using the formula then we get, So finally, So, Here Is there a closed form for ? Or maybe we can write in terms of some advance function? Are there some interesting properties of ? A list of the first few terms of :- , , , , , , , , , , You can yourself find more terms by just plugging the formula in Wolfram alpha. Notice the terms at the denominator have a very weird property, they are all prime numbers to the power of some rational numbers which is really weird. The more peculiar part is that they are not random prime numbers, but the first prime numbers. So there will definitely be some involvement of prime numbers in the evaluation of . Observing some patterns:- Notice that every terms namely the and terms have the first primes in their denominator. Also notice that when the prime first appears at the term it is being raised to the first power and at the term it is being raised to the power of . (If we say that the prime is ). I can't prove these observations, but if they are true to infinity then we can write- For some rational sequence and It seems like And the greatest common divisor of the denominators of and is not , namely If and such that Then, for I don't know if my observation are true to infinity or not, do they even simplify , I don't know. But it increases my hope for getting a closed form for . If I am able to spot more patterns then I will add it to the post. Working with the formula itself:- I hadn't really worked with the formula yet. I spent the last 2 days trying to find more patterns, I think I may have found another one but I need work on that a little bit more before I add that to the question. I am sure is the following progress or regress, but whatever. Now I am going to break into two infinite sums as following Where, Here i replaced every with And, Here i replaced every with . Before I do anything with these and . I want to first take care of the product inside both of them. Let, Since, And by Wolfram Alpha we have, Also notice, and, And finally again from Wolfram Alpha , We have- So, Now replacing with should give us which corresponds to the product inside . I am not sure would it work or not because won't be an integer anymore. And I don't know what means when . So let's leave that idea and re do the process again. Let, We have- So, So finally, The real thing is that was this really a simplification or a complexification.

Where do you end up walking? It's very easy to see that you end up walking on the perimeter of the same square, with side equal to $1$ step (every $4$ steps you are back at the point where you started), if you are walking on a plane . But what happens if you walk on the surface of a sphere? The answer obviously depends on how long is your step in relationship to the sphere's radius $R$. If your step length is $\pi R$, for example, you end up walking back and forth over the same lune, formed by two half circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. If your step length is $\pi R/2$, you end up walking on a triangle, formed by quarter circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. I believe one can prove the following: a) For any $x\geq 0$ and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, there is a step length $y\in(x,x+\epsilon)$ such that the process above takes you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps. b) No step length that brings you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps is a rational multiple of the length of the circumference, $2\pi R$, except for integer multiples of $\pi R/2$ (which keep you cycling over the same $1$,$2$, or $3$ points). c) Any step length that does not bring you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps eventually brings you all over the surface of the sphere, in the sense that for any point $P$ on the sphere's surface and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$. In fact, for any point $P$ and any angle $\alpha$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$ and with an angle between $\alpha$ and $\alpha+\epsilon$ of your starting direction (measured as the angle between the respective great circles)! Can you prove any or all of the above? Note that a proof of b) would automatically yield an answer to this related question .","Take $1$ step forward, turn $90$ degrees to the left, take $1$ step forward, turn $90$ degrees to the left ... and keep going, alternating a step forward and a $90$-degree turn to the left.

It's very easy to see that you end up walking on the perimeter of the same square, with side equal to $1$ step (every $4$ steps you are back at the point where you started), if you are walking on a plane . But what happens if you walk on the surface of a sphere? The answer obviously depends on how long is your step in relationship to the sphere's radius $R$. If your step length is $\pi R$, for example, you end up walking back and forth over the same lune, formed by two half circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. If your step length is $\pi R/2$, you end up walking on a triangle, formed by quarter circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. I believe one can prove the following: a) For any $x\geq 0$ and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, there is a step length $y\in(x,x+\epsilon)$ such that the process above takes you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps. b) No step length that brings you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps is a rational multiple of the length of the circumference, $2\pi R$, except for integer multiples of $\pi R/2$ (which keep you cycling over the same $1$,$2$, or $3$ points). c) Any step length that does not bring you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps eventually brings you all over the surface of the sphere, in the sense that for any point $P$ on the sphere's surface and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$. In fact, for any point $P$ and any angle $\alpha$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$ and with an angle between $\alpha$ and $\alpha+\epsilon$ of your starting direction (measured as the angle between the respective great circles)! Can you prove any or all of the above?

We must apply sophisticated techniques like limits to evaluate these sums. So $ 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + ... $ only makes sense when $|r| < 1$. So going back to the Fibonacci proof above. We are applying normal addition rules for an infinite summation and also the result $\displaystyle  F = \frac{1}{1-x-x^2} $ doesn't make sense for any value of $x$.

It would be absurd to use it as basis for other proofs. Please shed some light on this.

I want to focus on the rearrangement of terms in an infinite series . This is no different from results like $ 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1$. The usual answer given is that we cannot treat an infinite summation like this like real numbers and apply normal addition and subtraction rules . We must apply sophisticated techniques like limits to evaluate these sums. So $ 1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + ... $ only makes sense when $|r| < 1$. So going back to the Fibonacci proof above.

78,The divergent sum of alternating factorials,The divergent sum of alternating factorials,,"So I came across this exposition of a paper by Euler 1 where Euler is trying to sum the divergent sum: $$s = 1 - 1 + 2! - 3! + 4! \dots = \sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^k k!.$$ There are a couple of questions at the end. However, I would like to go through some exposition first: This sum is certainly divergent but this of course does not stop Euler. He goes through various manipulations and always ends up at the same value of $s \sim 0.5963$ . Briefly, the various methods are as follows: Let $s = \sum_{k\geq 1}(-1)^ka_k$ with $a_k > 0$ . He defines: $$b_l = \sum_{0\leq k\leq l}(-1)^{l-k}\binom{l}{k}a_{k+1}$$ and then shows that: $$s = \sum_{l\geq 1}\frac{b_l}{2^l}.$$ We can apply this to our $s$ repeatedly and find an approximate value. It is mentioned that he finds diverging series for $1/A$ and $\log A$ and using similar methods finds the same approximate value. He also manages to find continued fraction expansions for $A$ and $1/A$ and approximates them to the same value. Finally, the linked paper goes through the following fascination derivation. Define: $$s(x) = \sum_{k\geq 0}(-1)^kk!x^{k+1}.$$ Then: $$\frac{ds}{dx} = \frac{x-s}{x^2}$$ and Euler solves this differential equation to get the integral representation: $$s(x) = e^{1/x}\int_0^x\frac{e^{-1/t}}{t}dt$$ and evaluating at $x=1$ ends up with the same approximation. Questions: There are a few obvious questions here. There seems to be a strong internal consistency to this series. Why?

Link on Internet Archive","So I came across this exposition of a paper by Euler 1 where Euler is trying to sum the divergent sum: There are a couple of questions at the end. However, I would like to go through some exposition first: This sum is certainly divergent but this of course does not stop Euler. He goes through various manipulations and always ends up at the same value of . Briefly, the various methods are as follows: Let with . He defines: and then shows that: We can apply this to our repeatedly and find an approximate value. It is mentioned that he finds diverging series for and and using similar methods finds the same approximate value. He also manages to find continued fraction expansions for and and approximates them to the same value. Finally, the linked paper goes through the following fascination derivation. Define: Then: and Euler solves this differential equation to get the integral representation: and evaluating at ends up with the same approximation. Questions: There are a few obvious questions here. There seems to be a strong internal consistency to this series. Why? Usually, I would suspect that there is some analytic continuation lurking in the background. Is this true?

The $T$-iterates of $x$ (when they exist) are then $x, Tx, T^2x, T^3x,...$ Terminology :  Given an infinite sequence $x$, a run in $x$ is any subsequence of $x$ comprising one or more contiguous equal elements. A run is called maximal if it is not adjacent to an element equal to those in the run. If a run has finitely many elements, then their number is called the length of the run; otherwise, the length of the run is said to be infinite. Question : Is there any $x \in S$ having infinitely-many distinct $T$-iterates? If ""no"", how to prove? If ""yes"", how to construct an example? I suspect that no $x\in S$ has infinitely-many distinct iterates, and that every $T$-trajectory either terminates at some iterate not in $S$, or eventually enters a cycle (as in the following examples). Each point in $S$ has exactly two immediate $T$-predecessors, and these are mutual ""complements""; i.e., for any $x\in S$, there exist exactly two points in $S$, say $w$ and $\overline{w}$, such that $Tw = T \ \overline{w} = x$, where $\overline{w}$ is the result of replacing (in  $w$) each $1$ by $2$ and vice versa. (Consequently, in the above picture, it must be the case that $y=\overline{z}$ and $q=\overline{t}$. This applies to the numerical examples given below in $1b$.) The question can be formally restated by partitioning $S$ as follows: $$S = (A_{1a} \cup A_{1b}) \cup A_2$$ where (with $i,j,k$ restricted to nonnegative integers) $$\begin{align} A_{1a} & = \{x \in S : \exists i (T^i x \notin S)  \}\\ A_{1b} & = \{x \in S : \forall i (T^i x \in S) \ \mathrm{and} \  \exists\ j\ne k \ (T^jx = T^kx)  \}\\ A_2 & = \{x \in S : \forall i (T^i x \in S) \ \mathrm{and} \  \forall\ j\ne k \ (T^jx \ne T^kx)  \}. \end{align} $$ In other words, for any infinite sequence $x\in S$, iterating $T$ repeatedly must result in exactly one of the following cases: $x$ has only finitely-many distinct iterates in $S$. 1a.

This works because even positions have $0$ and odd positions have $1$ . However, this question is part of a homework and modulus has not been discussed (or part of the syllabus or even a prerequisite). And so I am hesitant to use it.
