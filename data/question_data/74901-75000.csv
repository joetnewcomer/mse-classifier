0,Can isomorphic groups act on a topological space in different ways?,Can isomorphic groups act on a topological space in different ways?,,The question arises from the fact that each topological manifold $X$ is homeomorphic to its universal cover $X_0$ quotiented by the action of the fundamental group $\pi_1(X)$ . It is natural to ask wether two spaces with the same universal covering and with isomorphic fundamental group are homeomorphic. The answer is affirmative in the case of compact surfaces. In general we ask wether two isomorphic groups $G$ and $G'$ can act properly discontinously and freely on a simply connected space $X$ in two different ways i.e. the corresponding quotient spaces $X/G$ and $X/G'$ are not homeomorphic.,The question arises from the fact that each topological manifold is homeomorphic to its universal cover quotiented by the action of the fundamental group .

6,Why is the Stone space of a Boolean algebra compact?,Why is the Stone space of a Boolean algebra compact?,,"Quick introduction:  I left mathematics about $30$ years ago to begin law school and pursue a career as a lawyer.  I've reacquired the itch, and I've been very slowly going through Set Theory:  An Introduction to Independence Proofs by Kenneth Kunen ( $1980$ edition). After about $18$ months, I'm working my way through Chapter $2$ and I've reached the discussion of Martin's Axiom.  I'm looking specifically at Theorem $3.4$ , which asserts a number of equivalent conditions to Martin's Axiom. Kunen sets up the proof by using the Stone space of a complete Boolean algebra $\mathscr B$ .  The Stone space is a new concept for me.  I think the definition Kunen states is standard -- the points of the space are the algebra's ultrafilters, and a basis for the topology is $\{ U_p \mid p \in \mathscr B \setminus \{ \mathbb 0 \} \}$ , where $U_p$ is the set of all ultrafilters containing $p \in \mathscr B$ . I see why this set is a basis for a topology.  Kunen asserts that it's a compact, totally disconnected Hausdorff space.  I see why it's Hausdorff and that each set in the basis is clopen.  I'm having trouble seeing why the Stone space is compact.  (Kunen asserts that we don't need the algebra to be complete but I'm willing to use the fact if it helps.) I'm trying to prove that a collection of closed sets with the finite intersection property has non-empty intersection.  I think that any closed set turns out to be an arbitrary intersection of basic open sets, so we can assume without loss of generality that the closed sets in our collection are in fact basic open sets, $U_{p_\alpha}$ .  Therefore, if the collection has the f.i.p., the various $p_\alpha$ must be pairwise compatible.

Then, there is a (unique) compactification $X^*$ where $X^*-X=\{w\}$, with $w$ a point of $X^*$. (For now, I'm not interested in proving uniqueness, only existence). As far as I understand, we can define compactification as follows: Definition: Let $X$ be a nonempty set. If $Y$ is a compact space,$X$ is a subset of $Y$ and $X$ is dense in $Y$, then we say that $Y$ is a compactification of $X$. Question 1: Is this the most general definition? So, I must find a set $X^*=X\cup \{w\}$ such that $X^*=\overline{X}$. Question 2: How exactly can I go about it? EDIT: I know that the chosen topology for $X^*$ is of the form  $$ \tau^*=\tau \cup \{X^*-C : C\text{ is compact and } C\subseteq X \} $$ and I want to know how can I motivate this topology. (This can replace my second question). What I thought: $\{w\}$ can't be open in $X^*$ since $X^*$ is the closure of $X$, and if $\{w\}$ is open there is one point of $X^*$ which has a neighborhood with no points of $X$ (contradiction). $X$ must have the subspace topology. Hence, given an open set $U$ of $X$, it must be $U=X\cap U^*$ for some open set $U^*$ of $X^*$. One way this can happen is if $U$ is open in $X^*$. The other one is if $U\cup \{w\}$ is open in $X^*$. So, for each open set $U$ of $X$, either $U$ is open in $X^*$ or $U\cup \{w\}$ is (or both). I'm not seeing how one excludes these second ones, and also how one uses the compactness of $X^*$ to motivate the $\{X^*-C : C\text{ is compact and } C\subseteq X \}$ part of the topology.","I've been trying to prove the following proposition: Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. Then, there is a (unique) compactification $X^*$ where $X^*-X=\{w\}$, with $w$ a point of $X^*$. (For now, I'm not interested in proving uniqueness, only existence). As far as I understand, we can define compactification as follows: Definition: Let $X$ be a nonempty set. If $Y$ is a compact space,$X$ is a subset of $Y$ and $X$ is dense in $Y$, then we say that $Y$ is a compactification of $X$. Question 1: Is this the most general definition? So, I must find a set $X^*=X\cup \{w\}$ such that $X^*=\overline{X}$. Question 2: How exactly can I go about it? EDIT: I know that the chosen topology for $X^*$ is of the form  $$ \tau^*=\tau \cup \{X^*-C : C\text{ is compact and } C\subseteq X \} $$ and I want to know how can I motivate this topology. (This can replace my second question). What I thought: $\{w\}$ can't be open in $X^*$ since $X^*$ is the closure of $X$, and if $\{w\}$ is open there is one point of $X^*$ which has a neighborhood with no points of $X$ (contradiction). $X$ must have the subspace topology. Hence, given an open set $U$ of $X$, it must be $U=X\cap U^*$ for some open set $U^*$ of $X^*$. One way this can happen is if $U$ is open in $X^*$. The other one is if $U\cup \{w\}$ is open in $X^*$.

51,What is the purpose of this axiom in the definition of a uniform space?,What is the purpose of this axiom in the definition of a uniform space?,,"I started reading about uniform spaces the other day, and in an attempt to familiarize myself with the notion I attempted to work through some examples based on the entourage definition of a uniformity. I was able to understand and verify the uniformity on a metric space in which $\{\{(x,\ y)\ |\ d(x,\ y)<a\}\ |\ a\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\}$ is a fundamental system of entourages. However, something still doesn't sit well with me, and that's the 4th axiom wikipedia gives: If $U\in\Phi$, then there is some $V\in\Phi$ for which $(x,\ y)\in V$ and $(y,\ z)\in V$ implies $(x,\ z)\in U$. I recognize that this implies that for all $U\in\Phi$, there is $V\in\Phi$ for which $V\circ V\subseteq U$ where $\circ$ is the binary relation composition operator. My question is: why? Why is it necessary to include this in the definition of a uniform space? As far as I've read, it appears to me uniform spaces were invented to generalize the notion of uniform continuity between spaces: a map between uniform spaces is uniformly continuous if the image of an entourage in the domain space is an entourage in the codomain space. This also allows us to generalize the notion of Cauchy sequences to Cauchy nets. I understand that a net $(x_\alpha)$ is a Cauchy net if for every entourage $U$ there is $\lambda$ such that whenever $\alpha,\ \beta > \lambda$, $(x_\alpha,\ x_\beta)\in U$. Now, I can understand how the notion of a Cauchy net generalizes the notion of a Cauchy sequence (under the condition that an entourage is taken to be a binary relation of ""closeness""), but I haven't worked through the details of why the above definition of a uniformly continuous map preserves Cauchy nets (though it doesn't sound too far off from the usual proof that uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}$ preserve Cauchy sequences). I read in this answer that the 4th axiom is essentially inspired by the triangle inequality, but that doesn't quite make sense to me either. I suppose it could be that axiom 4 is meant to generalize the notion of a metric space, in which uniform continuity can be defined (and in fact, the notion of a metric is required in the usual definition of uniform continuity), but I still don't quite see how omitting the 4th axiom would break the definition of uniform continuity.

If you have a rectifiable Jordan curve, can any two points in its interior be connected by a path in the interior made up of a finite number of directed line segments? Here's my heuristic for believing it's true: let $f(t), t \in [a, b]$ be a parametrization of the curve $J$. Place a mesh $(x_i)_{1 \le i \le n}$ on $[a, b]$ and construct a polygonal curve $P$ approximating $J$ by connecting $f(x_j)$ to $f(x_{j+1})$ with a directed line segment (connecting $f(x_n)$ to $f(x_1)$) and traversing the line segments in order. My guess is that as the mesh gets finer, eventually $P$ will lie in the interior of $J$ and will not cross $J$ anywhere.

Here are my questions: But the order $φ(t)$ depends continuously on $t$, since $f(z)$ is a continuous function of $z$. Hence we shall have a contradiction, for the function $φ(t)$ can assume only integral values and therefore cannot pass continuously from the value $0$ to the value $n$. I don't get this part. What is it trying to say? I know that $f(z)$ is a continuous function, and that $φ(t)$ changes 'smoothly' with $t$ (in my mind I have a picture of a closed curve shrinking 'smoothly' when the circle that $z$ traces also shrinks in the same way, hence, at every value of $t$, there exists a unique order. However, I also know that the order must have integral values, because there can't be $3.14$ turns.) But is this correct? I think I'm getting these concepts in a muddle. I also can't see how this contradiction serves to show that our initial assumption about $f(z)$ not having a root is absurd. Since the expression on the left is the distance between the two points $z^n$ and $f(z)$, while the last expression on the right is the distance of the point $z^n$ from the origin, we see that the straight line segment joining the two points $f(z)$ and $z^n$ cannot pass through the origin so long as z is on the circle of radius $t$ about the origin. What does this really imply? In my mind I think that whenever z traces out a circle with a radius $t$ $\neq$ $0$, the rest of the terms in $f(z)$ will never be $0$. But how does this help with proving that when t is large,  $f(z)$ behaves like $z^n$? This being so, we may continuously deform the curve traced out by $f(z)$ into the curve traced out by $z^n$ without ever passing through the origin, simply by pushing each point $f(z)$ along the segment joining it to $z^n$. Since the order of the origin will vary continuously and can assume only integral values during this deformation, it must be the same for both curves. Since the order for $z^n$ is $n$, the order for $f(z)$ must also be $n$. What does ""deforming $f(z)$ into $z^n$ mean, and why do we want to do this?

We will show that if $S\in \mathcal{O} \implies S\in \mathcal{G}$. Suppose $S$ is open, $S\subset A$. Then $\forall x\in S, \exists \epsilon > 0$ s/t $N_{\epsilon}(x)\subset S$. By definition of $int(A)$, $int(A) = \cup_{O\in \mathcal{O}} O$, so in particular $S\subset int(A)$. But then $N_{\epsilon}(x)\subset S$ still holds so $S$ is open in $int(A)$, and therefore if $O\in \mathcal{O} \implies O\in \mathcal{G}$. Then the union of all $O$ in $\mathcal{O}$ is in the union of all $G\in \mathcal{G}$, so that $int(A) \subset int(int(A))$ Going the other way, if $S\subset int(A)$ and $S$ is open, then $\forall x\in S, \exists \epsilon > 0$ s/t $N_{\epsilon}(x)\subset S$. Since $int(A) \subset A$, $S\subset A$ and so $N_{\epsilon}(x)\subset S$ still holds, so $S$ is open in $A$, then $G\in \mathcal{G} \implies G\in \mathcal{O}$, so the union of all $G\in \mathcal{G}$ is in the union of all $O\in \mathcal{O}$, so $int(int(A))\subset int(A)$, and each is a subset of the other so they are equal. Any help would be great. Thanks!",,['general-topology']
