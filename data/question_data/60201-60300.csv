2,Number of ways to connect sets of $k$ dots in a perfect $n$-gon,Number of ways to connect sets of  dots in a perfect -gon,k n,"Let $Q(n,k)$ be the number of ways in which we can connect sets of $k$ vertices in a given perfect $n$ -gon such that no two lines intersect at the interior of the $n$ -gon and no vertex remains isolated. Intersection of the lines outside the $n$ -gon is acceptable. Obviously, $k|n$ , and $n$ can't be prime because otherwise there will be dots left unconnected. The $n$ -gon itself is an acceptable solution to a connection of $n$ vertices, and in the case of $k>2$ , these aren't lines, but a set of connected lines, a sort of a network formed by connected planar graphs with straight edges with $k$ vertices, which are required to be vertices of the $n$ -gon itself. There must always be $S =\frac nk$ sets of lines. For $k=2$ , there are exactly $\frac nk$ lines, and for $k>2$ , there are exactly $\frac nk$ , not lines but sets of such connected planar graphs. Take for example $Q(6,2)$ . We have a perfect hexagon. By brute-forcing with pencil and paper, I found that there are 5 ways to connect sets of 2 vertices (dots) such that no two lines intersect inside the hexagon. Hence, $Q(6,2) = 5$ . The following image depicts the case of $Q(6,2)$ : I know for sure that an elegant solution exists for $k=2$ , but I can't figure it out. For generality I ask about any amount of $k$ dots. It's also extremely important to note we're not dividing the $n$ -gon into $k$ -gons, but connecting paths between $k$ nodes/vertices/dots. Now let's move one step further: Let $U(n,k)$ be the number of unique ways to connect sets of $k$ dots in a perfect $n$ -gon, such that no two lines intersect, and rotational symmetry is neglected, i.e, every possible arrangement is unique and can't be formed by rotating or flipping another arrangement in any way. $U(6,2)=2$ . Note that $U(6,2)=2$ because the arrangements of the first line in the image are not unique, and can be formed by rotating one another. The same happens for the second line of arrangements. This results in only 1 unique arrangement for each line. Hence $U(6,2)=2$ . I'm pretty clueless about both functions $U$ and $Q$ , and I couldn't derive an algorithm or formula to any of them. Hence I'm posting this here. I'm pretty sure there's a pure combinatorial approach to this problem, perhaps involving Polya's Enumeration Theorem (PET). Is there an elegant solution to these functions? Can they even be solved for $k>2$ ? Any light shed on any of the functions will be very much appreciable, as I haven't been successful in deriving a formula for any of them. EDIT - Temporary Solutions + Relevant questions AND progress $$Q(n,2) = C_{n \over 2}\quad\text{where}\quad C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n\choose n}$$ And $C_n$ denotes the $n$ 'th Catalan number. Now let us denote $W(n) = U(n,2)$ . Can you find a formula for $W(n)$ ? Perhaps a connection between $Q(n,2)$ and $W(n)$ ?

Now moving to $U(n,k)$ Now it only remains to find a formula or an algorithm for $U(n,k)$ . Personally I think it has to do with Polya's Enumeration Theorem and Burnside's lemma , combined with the cycle-index of the symmetric group , $Z(S_n)$ . I've touched upon something related to that, and thus I think it's related. I'm not 100% sure but my instincts tell me it's related. EDIT 6 In order to make it clear, I'm hereby adding a picture to describe the case of $U(6,3)$ and by that to clarify better what $U(n,k)$ means. $U(6,3)=4$ , as shown in the picture above (@ Marko Riedel has pointed out an additional arrangement which I had previously missed). There are four unique arrangements to connect sets of 3 vertices such that no vertice remains isolated, no lines intersect at the interior of the hexagon, and each arrangement is unique and can't be formed by rotating or flipping any other arrangement. There are two unique path-types , one that is introduced by connecting 3 adjacent vertices ( $p_1$ ), and another that connects 2 vertices with a little ""jump"", and the third vertice is then adjacent ( $p_2$ ). Hope it makes things a bit clearer.. EDIT 7 As provided by @ Marko Riedel's algorithm, $U(n,3)$ sequence starts as follows: $$1, 4, 22, 201, 2244, 29096, 404064, 5915838,\ldots$$ Computation was very rough, and calculation times were long.

4,How many colors are necessary for a rectangle to never cover a color more than once?,How many colors are necessary for a rectangle to never cover a color more than once?,,"If we have an infinite grid, and we color each cell, how many colors do we need so that a $m \times n$ rectangle always covers at most 1 of each color no matter how it is placed? (Rotation of the rectangle is allowed.) It must be at least $mn$ , but it seems $mn$ is not always enough. Know results: For $m \times 1$ , the answer is $m$ . For $m \times m$ it is $m^2$ . Here is data from a computer program. Note that my program only considers periodic colorings with fundamental region the same area as the number of colors. So it is possible that colorings with less colors are possible if they are not arranged in this way. The table below shows $k - mn$ , where $k$ is the number of colors needed. The pattern seems obvious now (although a proof is still needed). A few conjectures: For all cases in the table, if $mn$ is not enough, then it looks like $mn + m$ is for $m < n$ . ( False. turns out this is not true; $6 \times 4$ seems to require 32 colors. I updated the table above.) From my constructions it looks like $mn$ may be sufficient once $m$ is large enough for fixed $n$ (and vice versa). This is consistent with how rectangular tilings work. ( Seems False. ) From  Gregory J. Puleo's comment: If $m$ divides $n$ , it is plausible that $mn$ is enough. (If $m$ divides $n$ , we can consider the rectangle a bar of larger squares, so by combining 1. and 2. from above we may be able to prove this.) ( True. See his answer.) For $m \times (m + 1)$ , the program finds colorings using $m(m + 2)$ colors. The fundemental region can be described by a parallelogram with two adjacent sides $(m(m + 2), 0)$ and $(m + 1, 1)$ . These squares are marked yellow in the first table. Edit: In fact, for rectangles represented by a white cell it seems that for $m \times (m + k)$ we need $m(m + 2k)$ colors. It looks like for $m \times n$ where $n = jm, jm - 1, jm - 2, \cdots, \lfloor\frac{m + 2}{2}\rfloor$ and all $j$ , we need $jm^2$ colors. These squares are marked green in the first table.

Background While trying to find all the fault-free tilings of the P-pentomino , I noticed that we can prove that the P-pentomino does not tile any $5 \times n$ rectangle for odd $n$ , because such a rectangle does not fit $n$ $2 \times 2$ squares, and therefor can also not fit $n$ P-pentominoes. This made me wonder how close we can generally come to tiling a rectangle with an arbitrary given rectangle.

6,What's the minimum number of $2$s needed to write a positive integer?,What's the minimum number of s needed to write a positive integer?,2,"This is just for fun and inspired by Estimating pi, using only 2s . For a positive integer $n$ , let $f(n)$ denote the minimum number of $2$ s needed to express $n$ using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, together with the ability to concatenate $2$ s, so for example $2 \times 22^2 + \frac{222}{2}$ is a valid expression. Other variants involving different sets of allowed operations are possible, of course. This function is very far from monotonic, so to smooth it out let's also consider $$g(n) = \text{max}_{1 \le m \le n} f(m).$$ For example, $f(1) = 2$ ( $1 = \frac 22$ ) $f(11) = 3$ ( $11 = \frac{22}{2}$ ) Question: What can you say about $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ ? Can you give exact values for small values of $n$ ? Can you give (asymptotic or exact) upper bounds? Lower bounds? As a simple example we can write any positive integer $n$ in the form $2^k + n'$ where $n' < 2^k$ ( $2^k$ is just the leading digit in the binary expansion of $n$ ), which gives $f(n) \le f(k) + 1 + f(n')$ . If we write $\ell(n) = \lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ then iterating this gives something like $$g(n) \le \sum_{k=1}^{\ell(n)} \left( g(k) + 1 \right).$$ This gives an upper bound growing something like $\ell(n) \ell^2(n) \ell^3(n) \dots$ which I think is pessimistic. For example, in my answer to the linked question I show that $$f(14885392687) \le 36$$ and $\ell(14885392687) = 33$ so maybe we can expect something as good as $g(n) = O(\log n)$ for an upper bound.

This I found to be a very fascinating result. Then I began to notice some sequences, such as particular sequences of zeroes and ones appearing in various rows. An observation I made is that as Pascal's triangle is symmetric by way of $\binom{n}{m}= \binom{n}{n-m}$, the reverse of any sequence of 0s and 1s that appears in this version of Pascal's triangle will also appear. Looking at various sequences, the shortest sequences to not seem to appear were $1101$ and its reverse, $1011$. I attempted to then prove two things. First, I wanted to prove that these sequences would never appear in the 'parity Pascal triangle'. I can see intuitively why they would never appear- if we divide the Sierpinski triangle into stages of itself, we see that the $101$ sequence only appears in the middle row of the second stage of the fractal, and as the $nth$ stage of the fractal only appears as part of the $n+1$th stage of the fractal, this sequence will always be followed by the center of $0$s of another stage of the fractal. Similarly, any sequence $100...11$ can appear, but $1011,100011, 1000000011$, and so on with the number of 0s being of form $2^n-1$ cannot appear. As I said, intuitively this is because $2^n-1$ 0s bookended by two 1s appears at places where either one of the two 1s is on the edge of the fractal and the other at the edge of the central triangle of 0s in some stage of the fractal.

We start by investigating the lower cases , suppose we have only two variables $a_1,a_2$ with $a_1+a_2=k$ then $$\displaystyle \sum_{a_1+a_2=k}(a_1 a_2) =\sum_{N=1}^{k-1} N(k-N)=\frac{k(k-1)(k+1)}{3!}=\binom{k+1}{3}$$ Now if we take the case of $3$ variables where $a_1+a_2+a_3=k$ , we can achieve the sum as : $$ \displaystyle \sum_{a_1+a_2+a_3=k} a_1 a_2 a_3 = \sum_{N=1}^{k-2} N\binom{k+1-N}{3}= \frac{k(k-1)(k+1)(k-2)(k+2)}{5!}$$ Similarly for $4$ variables it turns out to be , $$ \displaystyle \sum_{a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4=k}a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 = \frac{k(k-1)(k+1)(k-2)(k+2)(k-3)(k+3)}{7!} $$ I believe for the same reason that that , $$ \displaystyle \sum_{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n=k}a_1 a_2\cdots a_n = \frac{k}{(2n-1)!}\prod_{m=1}^{n-1}(k-m)(k+m)$$ This is indeed tough to prove by induction , but I guess it can be proved due to the great symmetry and pattern this sequence follows. I haven't tried but will try to update a proof on this asap, but till then it's reasonable to conjecture this. Lastly we have that , $$\displaystyle \begin{align} S &= \sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \left(\frac{k}{(2n-1)!}\prod_{m=1}^{n-1}(k-m)(k+m)\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{(2n-1)!}\sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{1}{k.k!} (k)_n (k)^n \\ &= \frac{1}{(2n-1)!}\sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{1}{k.k!} \left(\sum_{r=1}^{n}s(n,r)k^r\right) \left(\sum_{t=1}^n {n\brack t}k^t\right) \\ &= \frac{1}{(2n-1)!}\sum_{r,t=1}^n (-1)^{n+r} {n\brack r}{n\brack t}\left(\sum_{k=n}^\infty \frac{k^{r+t-1}}{k!}\right) \end{align}$$ Now using Dobinski's Formula we have finally, $$\displaystyle \sum_{a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n=1}^\infty \frac{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}{(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n)!}\\ = \frac{1}{(2n-1)!}\sum_{r=1}^n\sum_{t=1}^n (-1)^{n+r} {n\brack r}{n\brack t} \left[eB_{r+t-1}-\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}\frac{m^{r+t-1}}{m!}\right] $$ where $B_n$ is the n-th Bell Number. Edit: After some investigation it was clear that the constant term in the final closed form which always disappeared whenever you calculate the sum for a specific $n$ and you are left with a rational multiple of $e$ was no magic but some logic.

Firstly, if we separate the answer into two parts and take the constant term which doesn't have $e$ , we get $$\displaystyle \sum_{r=1}^n \sum_{t=1}^n \sum_{m=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{n-r}{n\brack r}{n\brack t}\frac{m^{r+t-1}}{m!} $$ A little modification and interchange of sums will give the result in terms of the Pochammer symbol. $$ \displaystyle \sum_{m=1}^{n-1} \frac{(m)_n m^{t-1}}{m!} =0$$ This sum is eventually equal to zero and is easy to prove by induction. Thus the answer is  : $$\displaystyle \sum_{a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n=1}^\infty \frac{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}{(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n)!}\\ = e\left[\frac{1}{(2n-1)!}\sum_{r=1}^n\sum_{t=1}^n (-1)^{n+r} {n\brack r}{n\brack t} B_{r+t-1}\right]$$","It is tagged as an open problem in the book Fractional parts,series and integrals.

32,Graceful graphs with Valence $k$,Graceful graphs with Valence,k,"For a graceful graph ( code ), vertices are labeled with values from 0 to $e$ so that the $e$ edge differences are all values from 1 to $e$ .

graph ( code ), vertices are labeled with values from 0 to so that the edge differences are all values from 1 to . The below is now OEIS sequence A308722 . is the minimal valence 2 graph with . is the minimal valence 3 graph with . is the minimal valence 4 graph with . The minimal graceful graph with valence 5 has . The minimal graceful graph with valence 6 has . The minimal graceful graph for valence 7 has . It is unique. What are minimal graceful graphs with valence 8 and up? These are heavily related to sparse rulers .  My guess for future behavior is: e=48 with 12 vertices of valence 8. (verified this one) e=63 with 14 vertices of valence 9. Verified.  The graph complement of the following is graceful. Or in the more normal form e=75 with 15 vertices of valence 10.  Verified. There are 37 such graphs.  The graph complement of the following is graceful. e=99 with 18 vertices of valence 11. (e=88 proved impossible). Verified. e=108 with 18 vertices of valence 12.  Verified. The graph complement of the following is graceful. e=130 with 20 vertices of valence 13. Verified. e=147 with 21 vertices of valence 14. e=180 with 24 vertices of valence 15. e=192 with 24 vertices of valence 16. e=221 with 26 vertices of valence 17. e=243 with 27 vertices of valence 18. e=285 with 30 vertices of valence 19. e=320 with 32 vertices of valence 20. e=336 with 32 vertices of valence 21. Many of these graceful graphs are based on data obtained for the Sparse Ruler Conjecture .  That page lists sample sparse rulers to length 600.

33,Math puzzle: 10 digit strings generations,Math puzzle: 10 digit strings generations,,"There was a question in a math competition that I attended last year. At the end of competition, I realized that my answer was wrong for the question below and I have never been able to figure out how to solve it. Here is the question: You are asked to generate 10 digit strings using digits from 0 to 9 once each. Any four-digit substring used in a string cannot be used again. What is the highest number of unique strings you can generate using these rules? (and I need the list of them) Example: If you use a string 0243697518 in your list, you can not generate strings contain 0243, 2436, 4369, 3697, 6975, 9751 and 7518 To solve the problem, I have written a c++ program, simply it scans all permutation of ""0123456789"" and add them into a solution list if 4 digit sub-strings of the code has not been used before. But the problem of my algorithm is that the size of solution list varies by depending on your starting point that you add into the list first. If I start adding into list from ""0123456789"", list ends up with 504 entries which is not the maximum asked. I really wonder how to solve this question, any help highly appreciated. I'm open to hear your mathematical solution or any algorithm suggestions to generate the list asked. Histogram of random approach as suggested by Peter (min: 575, max: 606): Above algorithm tries to generate list asked by scanning all possible 10 digit strings in a random sequence. Histogram generated over 100K trials. Because all possible 10 digits strings needed to be scanned for each iterations are 10! = 3.6 million, each iterations takes 10 seconds on my pc to complete. I could try optimizing my algorithm more if I believed that there was really no deterministic solution for the question.","There was a question in a math competition that I attended last year.

52,Expanding and understanding the poison pills riddle,Expanding and understanding the poison pills riddle,,"You might have heard of the riddle that asks you to identify one fake pill (poisoned) among 12 pills of identical appearance, with the fake pill being either lighter or heavier than the others. You have a pair of comparative scales at your disposal, but must only use it three times. (To increase suspense, the lives of your friends depend on your correct and timely solution of this problem.) I would like to discuss the underlying principles of information theory and use the results of that discussion to expand the riddle. As I have found out, it is also possible to solve this riddle if you have 13 pills, one of them poisoned. Edit : This only works if you do not have to know whether the poisoned pill is heavier or lighter than the others (however it can be unknown). The key theme in solving this riddle is to arrange the scalings such that you get as much information as possible in the worst case scenario . Consider the idea to scale 6 pills against 6 other pills. If they have the same weight, you can be 100% certain that the 13th pill is the fake one (best case scenario), but if their weight differs, you have learnt almost nothing (namely, that the 13$^{th}$ pill is not poisoned, and that 6 specific pills are heavier than 6 others.) The information content of an event is inversely related to its likelihood, so as it is very likely (12:1) that the 13$^{th}$ pill is not the fake one, the worst case information content is low. As there are three possible outcomes in a scaling process (left is heavier, right is heavier, and same weight) you should start by putting about a third of the pills away in the first weighting process. Furthermore, you have to make sure to get as much information as possible from each weighting process. For starters, that means you should not do the same weighting twice (obvious, isn’t it?). Instead, rearrange the pills in a systematic way to allow for the result of the weighing to reflect different possible scenarios. I.e, if you have identified a group of 4 pills as “light” after the first weighing, put one aside, substitute one with a “heavy”, one with a “safely unpoisoned” and leave one one the same scale pan as it was before, and observe what change this causes. Following these rules, it will be quite easy to figure out the solution to this riddle, at least it is by far easier than trying out all possible combinations of weighings and wondering whether that gave you enough information to identify the fake pill or not. Question 1: These “rules” seem intuitive to me, but I wonder if there is some more solid information theory behind them? Also, since a more complex riddle is a better riddle, I wonder how many pills could be tested for one fake pill, if you had 4 weighings? (Question 2). There is an obvious minimum number, for which a solution can be easily found: 25. The easy solution is: Put 13 pills aside and weigh 6 against 6. If they have equal weight, proceed with the 13 remaining pills as above. If they have different weight, proceed with the 12 pills as above. However, this wastes a lot of information, so I guess it should be possible with a much higher number of pills, although I do not know how to find that number. My third question is to what degree would complexity of this problem rise if there were 2 poisoned fake pills (either of same or of potentially different weight) ? Best wishes, Martin","You might have heard of the riddle that asks you to identify one fake pill (poisoned) among 12 pills of identical appearance, with the fake pill being either lighter or heavier than the others. You have a pair of comparative scales at your disposal, but must only use it three times. (To increase suspense, the lives of your friends depend on your correct and timely solution of this problem.) I would like to discuss the underlying principles of information theory and use the results of that discussion to expand the riddle. As I have found out, it is also possible to solve this riddle if you have 13 pills, one of them poisoned. Edit : This only works if you do not have to know whether the poisoned pill is heavier or lighter than the others (however it can be unknown). The key theme in solving this riddle is to arrange the scalings such that you get as much information as possible in the worst case scenario . Consider the idea to scale 6 pills against 6 other pills. If they have the same weight, you can be 100% certain that the 13th pill is the fake one (best case scenario), but if their weight differs, you have learnt almost nothing (namely, that the 13$^{th}$ pill is not poisoned, and that 6 specific pills are heavier than 6 others.) The information content of an event is inversely related to its likelihood, so as it is very likely (12:1) that the 13$^{th}$ pill is not the fake one, the worst case information content is low. As there are three possible outcomes in a scaling process (left is heavier, right is heavier, and same weight) you should start by putting about a third of the pills away in the first weighting process. Furthermore, you have to make sure to get as much information as possible from each weighting process. For starters, that means you should not do the same weighting twice (obvious, isn’t it?). Instead, rearrange the pills in a systematic way to allow for the result of the weighing to reflect different possible scenarios. I.e, if you have identified a group of 4 pills as “light” after the first weighing, put one aside, substitute one with a “heavy”, one with a “safely unpoisoned” and leave one one the same scale pan as it was before, and observe what change this causes. Following these rules, it will be quite easy to figure out the solution to this riddle, at least it is by far easier than trying out all possible combinations of weighings and wondering whether that gave you enough information to identify the fake pill or not.

58,Counting binary sequences with no more than $2$ equal consecutive numbers,Counting binary sequences with no more than  equal consecutive numbers,2,"I invented the following problem, but I can't solve it. There are $n$ $1$'s and $n$ $0$'s and my question is what is the number of ways to arrange them avoiding $3$ equal consecutive numbers. So for instance, $n=3$ gives 001011, 001101, 010011, 010101, 010110, 011001, 011010, and the same sequences that start with $1$, that's $14$ in total. The first values are: $2,6,14,34,84,208$. (starting with $n=1$) It seems to be almost an exponential function. I started defining the function $N(a,b)$ which gives all possible sequences with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones such that no $3$ consecutive numbers are equal, and that begin with a $0$. The same for $E(a,b)$ which gives all possible sequences with $a$ zeroes and $b$ ones such that no $3$ consecutive numbers are equal, and that begin with a $1$. It's not hard to see that $N(a,b)=E(b,a)$. I found a kind of recursive formula for $N(a,b)$. Such a sequence can start with $00$. The rest of it is a sequence that starts with a $1$, that gives $E(a-2,b)=N(b,a-2)$ possibilities. If it starts with $01$, every tail is possible unless those that start with $11$. The question is what this number of sequences is that start with $11$. But because after these two $1$'s comes a $0$, it's simply $N(a-1,b-3)$. Adding everything up gives $$N(a,b)=N(a-1,b-1)+N(b-1,a-1)+N(b,a-2)-N(a-1,b-3).$$ This is another approach of mine: Every sequence consists a certain number of series of $1$'s and of $0$'s. Let $n$ be divisible by $2$ (The other case is almost the same.) The number of series is at least $n/2$ and at most $n$. The number of $0$-series can be equal to or one more then the number of $1$-series.

This spurred me on to investigating the Maths behind generating such a pack of cards, starting with much more basic examples with only 2 symbols on each card and gradually working my way up to 8 . This has been explored extensively in the linked question "" What is the Math behind the game Spot it "". What has been established is that if the number of symbols on each card is N, then the maximum number of different symbols throughout the pack is C , the maximum number of cards in a pack is also C, the number of times any given symbol is repeated throughout the pack is N, and N and C are related as follows : C = N^2 - N + 1    [ N squared minus N plus one ] But I still do not understand the algorithm for generating the cards from a given symbol set .

Even for a simple matrix with N=3 and C=7, I know what the matrix should look like , but can't seem to understand his descriptive syntax .  For example in column 2, row 4, his formula suggests the symbol is the one numbered 3N-1 in the sequence of 7 symbols, but 3N-1= 8 , so which symbol should I use? Is he making an assumption that we just wrap around (subtract 7) and start counting again from the beginning of the sequence ? But this still generates the wrong symbol . I know from looking at the pattern that it should be either symbol no 4 or symbol no 5, but just can't see how this arises from his formula .  If we take the 7 symbols as being the letters ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"" and ""F"", then the matrix should be as follows below : A B C A D E A F G B D F B E G C D G C E F Can anyone help me?

What is remarkable ( mathematically ) is that any two cards chosen at random from the pack will have one and only one matching symbol . This spurred me on to investigating the Maths behind generating such a pack of cards, starting with much more basic examples with only 2 symbols on each card and gradually working my way up to 8 . This has been explored extensively in the linked question "" What is the Math behind the game Spot it "". What has been established is that if the number of symbols on each card is N, then the maximum number of different symbols throughout the pack is C , the maximum number of cards in a pack is also C, the number of times any given symbol is repeated throughout the pack is N, and N and C are related as follows : C = N^2 - N + 1    [ N squared minus N plus one ] But I still do not understand the algorithm for generating the cards from a given symbol set . I am trying to follow the matrix generated by Don Simborg , but I just can't quite follow his formula . Even for a simple matrix with N=3 and C=7, I know what the matrix should look like , but can't seem to understand his descriptive syntax .  For example in column 2, row 4, his formula suggests the symbol is the one numbered 3N-1 in the sequence of 7 symbols, but 3N-1= 8 , so which symbol should I use? Is he making an assumption that we just wrap around (subtract 7) and start counting again from the beginning of the sequence ? But this still generates the wrong symbol . I know from looking at the pattern that it should be either symbol no 4 or symbol no 5, but just can't see how this arises from his formula .  If we take the 7 symbols as being the letters ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"" and ""F"", then the matrix should be as follows below : A B C A D E A F G B D F B E G C D G C E F Can anyone help me?

89,"Given a set of digits, what is the biggest number we can make using exponentiation - numberphile noodle quiz","Given a set of digits, what is the biggest number we can make using exponentiation - numberphile noodle quiz",,"The question is motivated by a question on a can of number noodles. Each item is a digit between $0$ and $9$ . Clearly, if you form a string and consider it to represent a base $10$ integer, then you'll get the biggest number if you start with the high digits $999...$ and end with the zeros $...1111000000000$ . In this youtube video, username numberphile (who does enthusiastic number theory videos for the layman) presents the digis of his can and brings forward the following generalized question: Given a set of digits from my noodle can, what's the biggest number you can make using only (a) addition, (b) multiplication and (c) exponentiation? So here my thoughts: Generally, I'm given a multiset of digits and I can use up any of these together two form numbers greater than $9$ . And each of the three operations is binary, i.e. $(a,b)\mapsto a+b,\ \ \ \ \ \ $ $(a,b)\mapsto a\cdot b,\ \ \ \ \ \ $ $(a,b)\mapsto a^b,$ and only the last one isn't commutative and associative. The question seems to imply we can use bracketing as we like, so I won't bother about these. I can decide the first two tasks simply by checking if the concatenation of digits is better than binary operation for accieving big numbers: Given $n+1$ digits $(d_0,d_1,d_2,...,d_n)$ , their concatenation $\text{con}:(d_n,d_{n-1},d_{n-2},\dots,d_1,d_0) \mapsto \sum_{k=0}^n d_k 10^k$ gives us summands involving higher and higher powers of $10$ . Since for $d_{n}\ne 0$ we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k 10^k < 10^{n+1},$ we find $d_{n+1}\cdot\text{con}(d_n,\dots) =d_{n+1}\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k 10^k < d_{n+1}10^{n+1} < \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} d_k 10^k = \text{con}(d_{n+1},d_n,\dots).$ i.e. $\text{con}$ is stronger than multiplication for any free digit. However, checking some pairs of digits for the third operation $$2^3<3^2<23<32,$$ $$34<43<4^3<3^4$$ or $$5^2=25<2^5<52$$ I can see no obvious pattern! The algorithm to construct the biggest number will depend on the values of the symbols. So my first question is this (the question in the video): (c) Using concatenation and exponentiation, what is the biggest number you can make? How can you show that it is really is the maximum? I guess that proof should be done in general, but here are the specific digits of the problem: I'm just going to assume no available computer will be able to compute that absurd power, but I'd be interested in some of its characteristics nevertheless. Further thoughts: Now if there are $N$ digits in total, which are free to use in concatenation, you can use number sets of up to size $N$ for the binary operaton. E.g. If there were only three digits $\{0,3,7\}$ , the number sets of size $N=2$ would be $\{\{0,37\},  \{0,73\},\{3,70\},\{7,30\}\}$ . Side note: There is an obvious additional rule regarding zero, namely that you can't have strings starting with $0$ . For each number $N$ , there are a fixed number of possible bracketings, like e.g. $(a,((b,c),d))$ , which determine the result, $a^{(b^c)^d}$ here. I guess the bracketing is a simple (downwards) tree graph where each node has eighter none or two (downwards) offspings. One should be able to count these.

Each item is a digit between and . Clearly, if you form a string and consider it to represent a base integer, then you'll get the biggest number if you start with the high digits and end with the zeros . In this youtube video, username numberphile (who does enthusiastic number theory videos for the layman) presents the digis of his can and brings forward the following generalized question: Given a set of digits from my noodle can, what's the biggest number you can make using only (a) addition, (b) multiplication and (c) exponentiation? So here my thoughts: Generally, I'm given a multiset of digits and I can use up any of these together two form numbers greater than . And each of the three operations is binary, i.e. and only the last one isn't commutative and associative. The question seems to imply we can use bracketing as we like, so I won't bother about these. I can decide the first two tasks simply by checking if the concatenation of digits is better than binary operation for accieving big numbers: Given digits , their concatenation gives us summands involving higher and higher powers of . Since for we have we find i.e. is stronger than multiplication for any free digit. However, checking some pairs of digits for the third operation or I can see no obvious pattern! The algorithm to construct the biggest number will depend on the values of the symbols. So my first question is this (the question in the video): (c) Using concatenation and exponentiation, what is the biggest number you can make? How can you show that it is really is the maximum? I guess that proof should be done in general, but here are the specific digits of the problem: I'm just going to assume no available computer will be able to compute that absurd power, but I'd be interested in some of its characteristics nevertheless. Further thoughts: Now if there are digits in total, which are free to use in concatenation, you can use number sets of up to size for the binary operaton. E.g. If there were only three digits , the number sets of size would be . Side note: There is an obvious additional rule regarding zero, namely that you can't have strings starting with . For each number , there are a fixed number of possible bracketings, like e.g. , which determine the result, here. I guess the bracketing is a simple (downwards) tree graph where each node has eighter none or two (downwards) offspings. One should be able to count these.

Let $p$ a prime and suppose $p = \binom{n}{k}$. If $n$ is prime, then $n$ must be equals $p$, because $n\mid \binom{n}{k}$. But, in this case, $n\mid\mid \binom{n}{k}$, so $k=1$. (This would work to prime powers too.) If $n$ is composed, note that $\binom{n}{k} = p$ implies, a fortiori , that $p\mid \binom{n}{k}$ and consequently $p\leqslant n$. But under our conditions, $\binom{n}{k} > n$, contradiction. $\square$ Also, I've already saw in Proofs from THE BOOK the problem ""Binomial coefficients are (almost) never powers"", and although it is highly related, it doesn't provide much insight towards this problem (at least as far as I understood). EDIT: Prime powers aren't binomiables too! Let's state three results first: Lemma. Let $p$ a prime. If $p\mid n$ and $0<k<p$, then $p\mid \binom{n}{k}$. Proof. Let $n= pm$ and assume $0<k<p$. Consider the Vandermonde's identity: $$\binom{pm}{k} = \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{p}{j}\binom{p(m-1)}{k-j}.$$ It follows that $\binom{pm}{k}\equiv \binom{p(m-1)}{k} \mod{p}$ (the term $j=0$ in the sum). Repeating it $m$ times, we conclude $\binom{pm}{k}\equiv \binom{p}{k} \mod{p}$, and from $p\mid     \binom{p}{k}$ follows our statement. $\square$ Bertrand's postulate. If $n\geqslant 2k$, then the binomial $\binom{n}{k}$ has a prime factor $q > k$. Theorem. [Erdös] The binomial $\binom{n}{k}$ is never a perfect power for $4\leqslant k\leqslant n-4$. (This is the paragraph I mentioned in Proofs from THE BOOK .) So there is only two cases to analyse, $k=2$ and $k=3$. In both cases we can assume $n \geqslant 6$. CLAIM 2. Prime powers aren't ""binomiables"". Proof. Let $p$ a prime, $m>1$, and suppose $p^m = \binom{n}{k}$. If $k=2$, then $p^m = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. By Bertrand's postulate, $p\neq 2$. Now observe that $\gcd(n, n-1) = 1$, so   $$ p^m \mid n\quad \text{xor}\quad p^m\mid n-1. $$   Then:   $$2 =\frac{n(n-1)}{p^m} \geqslant n-1 \implies n \leqslant 3,$$   that contradicts $n\geqslant 6$. If $k=3$, then $p^m = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$. Bertrand's postulate allows us to take $p\neq 2,3$. Hence, similarly to the previous case, we can deduce:   $$p^m \mid n \quad \text{xor}\quad p^m\mid n-1 \quad \text{xor} \quad p^m\mid n-2.$$   But then:   $$ 6 = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{p^m} \geqslant (n-1)(n-2) \implies n \leqslant 4,$$   a contradiction. $\square$ EDIT 2: I've just realized that I didn't use the Lemma at all.
