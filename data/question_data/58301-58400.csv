74,How to Find the Function of a Given Power Series?,How to Find the Function of a Given Power Series?,,"(Please see edit below; I originally asked how to find a power series expansion of a given function, but I now wanted to know how to do the reverse case.) Can someone please explain how to find the power series expansion of the function in the title? Also, how would you do it in the reverse case? That is, given the power series expansion, how can you deduce the function $\frac{x}{1-x-x^3}$? I've also rewritten the function as $$\frac{x}{1-x-x^3} = x \cdot \frac{1}{1-x(1-x^2)}$$ which is of the form of the Maclaurin series $\frac{1}{1-x} = 1+x+x^2+x^3+\ldots$ So the series expansion would then be $$x \cdot (1+(x-x^3)+(x-x^3)^2+(x-x^3)^3+\ldots)$$ However, expanding this to find the simplified power series expansion becomes complicated. According to WolframAlpha (link: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=power+series+of+x%2F%281-x-x%5E3%29 ) it eventually works out to $$x+x^2+x^3+2x^4+3x^5+4x^6+6x^7+9x^8+13x^9+19x^{10} +\ldots$$ which is a function defined recursively by $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-3}$ for all $n\gt 3$ with the initial condition that $f_1=f_2=f_3=1$ Appreciate any and all help!

96,How to prove $a_{n} < 2$ if $\displaystyle a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+\frac{a_{n}}{3^n}$,How to prove  if,a_{n} < 2 \displaystyle a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+\frac{a_{n}}{3^n},"Let $(a_{n})_{n \geq1}$ be a real sequence such that $a_{1}=a_{2}=1$ and $\displaystyle a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+\frac{a_{n}}{3^n}, n\geq 1$. Prove that $a_{n} < 2, \forall n \geq 1.$ I write $$\sum a_{k+2}-a_{k+1}=\sum \frac{a_{k}}{3}$$  and I obtained : $$3a_{n+2}=a_{1}+\ldots+a_{n}+3$$ or $$a_{n}=\frac{a_{1}+\ldots+a_{n-2}+3}{3} < 2$$ And what remains to prove it is : $$a_{1}+\ldots +a_{n-2} < 3,$$ but from this point I don't know how I have to do. I need a proof without derivatives. Thanks :)","Let $(a_{n})_{n \geq1}$ be a real sequence such that $a_{1}=a_{2}=1$ and $\displaystyle a_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+\frac{a_{n}}{3^n}, n\geq 1$.

99,About the convergence of $f_n:=\sin{\sqrt{t+4n^2\pi^2}}$,About the convergence of,f_n:=\sin{\sqrt{t+4n^2\pi^2}},"Let $f_n \in C([0,+\infty))$ be defined by   $f_n(t):=\sin{\sqrt{t+4n^2\pi^2}}$, for $n \in \mathbb N$ and $t \ge 0$. Prove that $f_n$ converges pointwise to $f \in C([0,+\infty))$ and determine $f$; study the uniform convergence of the sequence on bounded intervals and on $[0;+\infty)$. Well, I've got some problems and I need your kind help. First of all, I've noted that $f_n(0)=0$ for every $n \in \mathbb N$. My guess is that the pointwise limit is $f \equiv 0$. But how can I prove it rigorously? I think that one should note that $4n^2\pi^2=(2n\pi)^2$ so there must be something related to periodicity of the function $\sin(\cdot)$... Thanks in advance.","Let $f_n \in C([0,+\infty))$ be defined by   $f_n(t):=\sin{\sqrt{t+4n^2\pi^2}}$, for $n \in \mathbb N$ and $t \ge 0$.
