I intend to prove that it must be integrable on $[a, b]$. Is my proof below correct? My Answer (Is it correct?): Since $f(x)$ has only a finite number of discontinuous points, call these points $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$.  Now let $r$ be some number greater than $0$ such that for all $\epsilon > 0$, $2r < \frac{\epsilon}{4M}$.  Now let $M_i =$ sup$_{x \in [p_i - r, p_i +r]}f(x)$ and $m_i =$ inf$_{x \in [p_i - r, p_i +r]}f(x)$. Then $M_i - m_i \leq 2M$. Now then $f$ must be continuous on each interval $[a, p_1 - r], [p_1 + r, p_2 - r], ...,[p_n + r, b]$ and thus $f$ must be integrable on each one of these intervals.

Thank you?","If $f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ is an integrable function on a real interval, then $$\left| \int_a^b f \right | \le \int_a^b |f| $$ There's a proof of this in Ahlfors' Complex Analysis book which really cool: you just rotate things so that the integral is real by multiplying by $e^{i\theta}$, then apply the similar result for real-valued functions. Qeustion: Can this also be done by something like applying the discrete triangle equality to Riemann sums for partitions and passing through the limit? If so, is there a good reference for it?

90,Value of $n$ for which an improper integral is convergent.,Value of  for which an improper integral is convergent.,n,"A question from the Calculus book that I'm self-studying is asking me to determine the value of $n$ for which the improper integral below is convergent: $$\int_1^{+\infty}\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2 + n} \right ) dx$$ My attempt is below: Using the definition of improper integral: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \int_1^{b}\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2 + n} \right ) dx$$ I will first solve the indefinite integral: $$\int\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2+n} \right )dx = \int \frac{n}{x+1}dx-\int \frac{3x}{2x^2+n}dx$$ For the first integral, $\int \frac{n}{x+1}dx=n\ln (x+1) + \text{constant}$. For the second integral, substituting $u = 2x^2+n$ (and therefore $dx=\frac{du}{4x}$), $\int \frac{3x}{2x^2+n}dx=\frac{3}{4}\int \frac{1}{u}du=\frac{3}{4}\ln(2x^2+n) + \text{constant}$. So, the result for the whole integral is: $$\int\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2+n} \right )dx = n\ln(x+1) - \frac{3}{4}\ln(2x^2+n) + \text{constant} = \ln\left(\frac{(x+1)^n}{(2x^2+n)^{3/4}}\right) + \text{constant}$$ Thus, the value of the definite integral from $x = 1$ to $x = b$ is: $$\ln\left(\frac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{(2)^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$$ Thus, the value of the improper integral is: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)\right]$$ For this limit to exist, it only depends on the limit of the term $\ln\left(\dfrac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$, because the term $\ln\left(\frac{2^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$ is a constant. To calculate the limit of $\ln\left(\dfrac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$ as $b\to +\infty$, I suppose we can neglect the terms $1$ in $(b+1)^n$ and $n$ in $(2b^2+n)^{3/4}$, because they become negligible as $b$ gets larger. Thus we get, for the limit of this term: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\frac{(b)^n}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right)$$ For the above limit to exist, it seems that $n = 3/2$ is the only possible value, because $\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{(b)^{3/2}}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{b^{3/2}}{2^{3/4}b^{3/2}}\right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{1}{2^{3/4}}\right)$. If any different value for $n$ were chosen, the logarithm would approach $-\infty$ or $+\infty$, and therefore the limit would not exist. For $n = 3/2$, the value of the limit is: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{(b)^{3/2}}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^{3/2}}{(2+3/2)^{3/4}}\right)\right]=\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{1}{2^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^{3/2}}{(7/2)^{3/4}}\right)\right]=\frac{3}{4}\ln\frac{7}{16}$$ This is equal to the answer given by the book. So, this informal argument of neglecting the terms $1$ and $n$ worked. But I would like to ask if the reasoning above is correct, and if this informal way of finding the value of $n$ is good. Is there a more formal way? Edit : A more formal way of showing that $n$ should be $3/2$ is suggested by David Mitra in the comments to this question below: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln \left( {(b+1)^n\over (2b^2+n)^{3/4} } \right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln \left( {b^n\over b^{3/2}} \cdot {\bigl(1+{1\over b}\bigr)^n\over \bigl(2 +{n\over b^2}\bigr)^{3/4}} \right)$$ It is clear from above that $n$ should equal $3/2$.

96,Change of variables,Change of variables,,How can I convert the integral $\int_0^{2\pi} (a^2 \cos^2 t +b^2\sin^2 t)^{-1} dt$ into an integral $\oint_\gamma z^{-1} dz$ where $z\in \mathbb C$ and $\gamma: {x^2\over a^2}+{y^2\over b^2}=1$? I can see that $|z|^2 = a^2 \cos^2 t +b^2\sin^2 t$ but the Jacobian seems very messy and I can't get the desired form.

97,Is how I treat $dx^2$ how you do it?,Is how I treat  how you do it?,dx^2,"Sometimes I come up with an integral with a $dx^2$ term.  Whenever I have this, I omit the integral with the $dx^2$ with the idea that it's negligible relative to other integrals with only a $dx$ term, the same way I would when I'm using Newton's method for approximations.  I've never read that this is what should be done, but when I do it I get the correct answer.  here's an example: I've been trying to figure out how to find the centre of mass of a lamina.  This is what I worked out for the vertical pivot line.  If the line is $X_c$ and the total mass is M, then: $$X_c = \frac{1}{M}\int_a^b f(x)\;dx\left(x+\frac{dx}{2}\right)$$ $$=\frac{1}{M}\int_a^b f(x)x\;dx + \frac{1}{2}\int_a^b f(x)\;dx^2$$ If I then omit the 2nd term I get the answer that I see in textbooks: $$=\frac{1}{M}\int_a^b f(x)x\;dx$$ This is the way I've figured out on my own and it seems to work but it doesn't seem legit.  What happens to that 2nd term really?  It may be negligible but it still exists, so...how do you deal with it?","Sometimes I come up with an integral with a $dx^2$ term.
