Then the number of abelian subgroups of $G$ of index $p$ is either $1$ or $p+1$; in the latter case the center of $G$ has index $p^2$. (b) A nilpotent group of class $3$ and order $16$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup of index $2$. I've made some progress towards (a) and tried to use (a) to show (b). But despite thinking about this for a few days I'm missing something and I can't quite finish off my argument. Here is an outline of the main results that I have managed to show; essentially, I think I've shown that for part (a), if there is more than one than there must be at least $p+1$. Assume that there is more than one abelian subgroup of index $p$. Let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. Then they are both maximal and hence normal in $G$, and then $G=HK$. Then I was able to show that $H \cap K \leq Z(G)$, and then it follows that $Z(G)$ has index $p^2$ (as $G$ is non-abelian). So now I want to show that there are exactly $p+1$ abelian subgroups of index $p$. Suppose $L$ is a subgroup of $G$ of index $p$ containing $H \cap K$. Then $L \lhd G$. Since $H \cap K \lhd G$ and it has index $p^2$, then $L/(H \cap K)$ is cyclic of order $p$. From this I was able to show that $L$ is abelian. Now consider $G/(H \cap K)$, which has order $p^2$; however it can't be cyclic since it has two subgroups of order $p$, namely $H/(H \cap K)$ and $K/(H \cap K)$. So $G/(H \cap K) \cong C_p \times C_p$, and it follows that it has $p+1$ subgroups of order $p$. This gives $p+1$ subgroups of $G$ of index $p$. By the above, each of these is abelian. Now I need to show that there can't be more than $p+1$ such subgroups... but I'm a bit stuck here. As for part (b), I thought I might be able to use (a) for this, if I can show that there does exist an abelian group of order 8 and it's cyclic.

Then the number of abelian subgroups of $G$ of index $p$ is either $1$ or $p+1$; in the latter case the center of $G$ has index $p^2$. (b) A nilpotent group of class $3$ and order $16$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup of index $2$. I've made some progress towards (a) and tried to use (a) to show (b). But despite thinking about this for a few days I'm missing something and I can't quite finish off my argument.

Assume that there is more than one abelian subgroup of index $p$. Let $H$ and $K$ be two of them. Then they are both maximal and hence normal in $G$, and then $G=HK$. Then I was able to show that $H \cap K \leq Z(G)$, and then it follows that $Z(G)$ has index $p^2$ (as $G$ is non-abelian).

For completeness, I may as well show the direction I said was straight forward, though this is not necessarily important to my question, Let $\gamma_M\in\Gamma(M)$ and $\gamma_N\in\Gamma(N)$ be given by $$ \gamma_M = \begin{pmatrix} a & b\\ c & d \end{pmatrix},$$ $$ \gamma_N = \begin{pmatrix} e & f\\ g & h \end{pmatrix}.$$ We can compute their product, $$ \gamma_M\gamma_N = \begin{pmatrix} ae + bg & af + bh\\ ce + dg & cf + dh \end{pmatrix},$$ and notice that by the restrictions of $a,b,c,d$ modulo $M$ and $e,f,g,h$ modulo $N$ we know, letting $G = \gcd(M,N)$, $$ ae + bg \equiv 1(\bmod\ G)$$ $$ af + bh \equiv 0(\bmod\ G)$$ $$ ce + dg \equiv 0(\bmod\ G)$$ $$ cf + dh \equiv 1(\bmod\ G)$$ and so $\gamma_M\gamma_N\in\Gamma(G)$. This shows $\Gamma(M)\Gamma(N)\subset \Gamma(G)$.",,"['group-theory', 'modular-forms']"

31,Proving that a group acting freely on a tree is a free group,Proving that a group acting freely on a tree is a free group,,"I want to prove that a group that acts freely on a tree is a free group. The proof I saw used weird things (in particular it considered edges as line segments, and used ""half-edges"") and I didn't like it so i tried to come up with my own proof, and the one I found seems much simpler, and therefore it seems suspicious (why go with a weird complicated proof when there is a simple, natural one ?).  Here goes :  I first prove the result assuming the action is transitive : let $G$ be a group acting freely and transitively on the (nonempty) tree $T= (V,E)$. Let $v$ be any vertex in $V$ and for $x$ a vertex, we let $N(x)$ be the set of neighbours of $x$. I also let $N := N(v)$ for simplicity. For all $n\in N$, there is $g\in G$ with $g\cdot v = n$, because the action is transitive and since the action is free, this $g$ is unique : we denote it by $g_n$. Then we put $S= \{g_n\mid n\in N\}$ and $S'\subset S$ such that for all $n\in N$, either $g_n$ or $g_n^{-1}$ belongs to $S'$, these options being mutually exclusive. I want to show that $S'$ is a free generating set for $G$. First of all, it is a generating set : let $g\in G$ and let $x_0 = v, x_1,..., x_m, x_{m+1} = g\cdot v$ be a path from $v$ to $g\cdot v$ in $T$. Since the action is transitive, we can find $g_i$ with $g_i \cdot v = x_i$. Since $\{x_i, x_{i+1}\}\in E$, it follows that $g_{i+1}^{-1}g_i\in S$ and thus, since $g_1\in S$, we get that $g\in \langle S\rangle = \langle S'\rangle$, which is what I wanted to prove. I now have to prove that $S'$ is a free generating set. But to any reduced word on $S'\cup S'^{-1}$ one can associate a path, and if, when computing the word in $G$ one gets $e$ (the unit of $G$), then we have a cycle in $T$, which is a contradiction with the fact that $T$ is a tree. Therefore $G$ has a free generating set : $G$ is a free group. Now if the action of $G$ isn't transitive, we make it transitive : let $G$ act freely on the tree $T=(V,E)$. Let $v$ be any vertex in $V$ and $V' := G\cdot v$ (the orbit of $v$). $g\cdot v$ and $h\cdot v$ are connected in an edge in $T' = (V', E')$ if and only if either they are connected in an edge in $T$, of if all paths from one to the other in $T$ don't intersect $G\cdot v$. Then $T'$ has no cycle because $T$ is a subdivision of $T'$, and $T$ has no cycles. Moreover, by construction, $T'$ is connected : $T'$ is a tree. The obvious action of $G$ on $T'$ is then free and transitive so we can use the previois result : $G$ acts freely and transitively on a tree, so it is a free group. In conclusion, if $G$ acts freely on a tree, it is free. My doubts about this proof are about the point where I prove that $S'$ is a free generating set. They come from this fact : it seems that $\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$ acts freely on the tree with two vertices. The action is obvious, and $1$ has no fixed point, so the action is indeed free. But $\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$ is not a free group. And when looking at how my ""proof"" goes wheb $G=\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$ and $T$ is the tree with two vertices, the point where it stops working is precisely the point where I claim that $S'$ is a free generating set.  While writing this, I see that my mistake is when I claim that I can define $S'$ : for $\Bbb{Z}/2\Bbb{Z}$, since $1= -1$, I cannot define $S'$ as I say.  But I know that the theorem is true : what am I not seeing ? EDIT: I'm adding this because according to another post on math.SE, it seems that the theorem that I'm mentioning (or at least one of its consequences: the Nielsen-Schreier theorem, which states that a subgroup of a free group is itself free) implies the axiom of choice for finite sets.

Group isomorphism $h_b:(\mathbb R,+)\to (\mathbb R^+,\times)$ can be given by the exponential function: $h_b(r)=b^r$ , where $b$ is a positive real number and is not $1$ . Moreover, after we define the group automorphism $A_x:(\mathbb R^+,\times)\to (\mathbb R,+)(r\mapsto xr)$ , the set of all exponential functions(with positive base) are related by $h_k(r) = h_bA_rh_b^{-1}(k)$ , with $A_r$ the automorphism defined above.

96,Find the conjugacy classes of $A_5$,Find the conjugacy classes of,A_5,"I was trying to find the conjugacy classes of $A_5$. So I started by writing out all the conjugacy classes of $S_5$ in the hope that I could just restrict the set of them. The conjugacy class representatives of $S_5$ are $$e,(12),(123),(1234),(12345),(12)(34),(12)(345)$$ So I restricted this set to even permutations to get $$e,(123),(12345),(12)(34)$$ but apparently $(12345)^2$ represents a conjugacy class as well. So I then computed it as $(13524)$. I cannot see why this would be conjugacy class as well. As far as I was aware conjugacy classes in $S_5$ are determined by cycle type, so I thought have thought this holds for the restriction to $A_5$. Now how would I have known a priori that $(12345)^2$ represents another conjugacy class or that I was missing a conjugacy class (assuming we dont know the number of irreducible representations). Is there a better way to approach this question?","I was trying to find the conjugacy classes of $A_5$.
