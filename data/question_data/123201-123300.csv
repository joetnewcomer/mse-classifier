The side-lengths would have a least common denominator, call it $d$ . Then we can say the legs are $\frac{m}{d}$ , $\frac{n}{d}$ , and the hypotenuse is $\frac{p}{d}$ , for some positive integers $m, n$ , and $p$ . Pythagoras gives: $\frac{m^2}{d^2}+\frac{n^2}{d^2}=\frac{p^2}{d^2}$ , or just $m^2+n^2=p^2$ . The area condition gives $\frac12\cdot\frac{m}{d}\cdot\frac{n}{d}=1$ , or equivalently $mn=2d^2$ . This is my first dead end. Try as I might to do manipulations, I can't see how the above implies the existence of integers $a, b, c$ satisfying $a^3+b^3=c^3$ . So I thought I'd try in reverse, and start by assuming some non-zero integers satisfy $a^3+b^3=c^3$ . One thought is to factor the sum of cubes on the LHS, to get $(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)=c^3$ . Then, thinking of Pythagoras, I can rearrange to isolate $a^2+b^2$ , which looks like $a^2+b^2=\frac{c^3}{a+b}+ab$ . However here is where I am stuck again. I don't really have a good idea of what to do with the right side. I'd appreciate help connecting the dots.

What is the ratio of area $\dfrac{\triangle PQR}{\triangle PGE}$ ? My attempt: Let's put this in $X$ - $Y$ coordinates with $C$ as origin and line $PQ$ being parallel to the $X$ -axis and $EC$ being the $Y$ -axis ( $C$ is the center of the incircle and radius $r$ ). $\angle APQ = \angle PER = \alpha = 60^0$ ; Say, $PG = EG = PE = 1$ unit Coordinates of points: $E(0,-r), P(-1,-r), C(0,0)$ . The equation of the line $PR$ : $y + r = m(x+1)$ As line $PR$ is tangent to the circle, the perpendicular from center $C$ will be equal to the radius. $r = \dfrac{r - m}{\sqrt{m^2+1}}$ or, $m = \dfrac{2r}{1-r^2}$ So, the equation of the line $PR$ : $y + r = \dfrac{2r}{1-r^2} (x+1)$ ...(1) Equation of line $ER$ : $y + r = -x \tan\alpha$ ...(2) Equating (1) and (2), we get the intersection point $R (x_0,y_0)$ [ $\dfrac{-2r}{2r+(1-r^2)\tan \alpha}, \dfrac{2r\tan \alpha}{2r+(1-r^2)\tan \alpha} - r$ ], where $\tan \alpha = \tan 60^0 = \sqrt3$ Equation of line $QR$ : $y - y_0 = m_0 (x - x_0)$ Again equating perpendicular distance from the center and the radius $r = \dfrac{m_0x_0 - y_0}{\sqrt{m_0^2+1}}$ or, $(x_0^2-r^2)m_0^2 - 2x_0y_0m_0 + (y_0^2 - r^2) = 0$ As there are two lines passing through $(x_0,y_0)$ that are tangent to the circle ( $PR$ and $QR$ ), the quadratic equation will give us two values of $m_0$ , one of them being $m_0 = \dfrac{2r}{1-r^2}$ as we have established before.

39,I'm having trouble identifying a 4-polytope from its system of inequalities,I'm having trouble identifying a 4-polytope from its system of inequalities,,"In the euclidean space, the points $(x,y,z)$ belonging to a regular octahedron are those that satisfy the inequalities $$ \pm x\pm y \pm z \leq a $$ where $a \geq 0$ . These eight inequalities can be divided into two groups of four according to the number (even or odd) of negative signs they contain. For example, the inequalities \begin{align} x-y+z\leq a\\ -x+y+z \leq a\\ x+y-z\leq a\\ -x-y-z\leq a \end{align} all have one or three negative signs and the points satisfying these form a tetrahedron. The other four inequalities correspond to the dual tetrahedron of the first, which shows that the intersection of two regular dual tetrahedra form a regular octahedron. Moreover, the vertices of the two tetrahedra can be seen as the eight vertices of a cube. I am wondering if there exists a similar relationship between regular polytopes in four dimensions. As it is another case of a regular cross-polytope, the hexadecachoron (or 16-cell) is defined by the sixteen inequalities $$ \pm x\pm y \pm z \pm w \leq a. $$ If one were to take the eight inequalities containing an odd number of negative signs, say \begin{align} x-y-z-w\leq a\\ -x+y-z-w\leq a\\ -x-y+z-w \leq a\\ -x-y-z+w\leq a\\ x+y+z-w \leq a\\ x+y-z+w \leq a\\ x-y+z+w \leq a\\ -x+y+z+w \leq a\\ \end{align} which 4-polytope would be obtained ? I doubt it would be a regular 5-cell, since (obviously) the number of cells and the number of hyperplanes don't add up. Besides, the intersection of the two 4-polytopes corresponding to the two sets of eight inequalities should technically correspond to the 16-cell. The tesseract, having eight cells, could be a candidate, but I have been unable to show that these eight inequalities define one (or any other 4-polytope). Any ideas ? Edit : I've discovered just now that 16-cells are four dimensional demihypercubes (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demihypercube ), and so they are analogous to tetrahedra in that two of them can be combined to obtain the 16 vertices of a tesseract. I am still interested to know what type of polytope corresponds to the eight inequalities above, however.","In the euclidean space, the points belonging to a regular octahedron are those that satisfy the inequalities where .

As it is another case of a regular cross-polytope, the hexadecachoron (or 16-cell) is defined by the sixteen inequalities If one were to take the eight inequalities containing an odd number of negative signs, say which 4-polytope would be obtained ? I doubt it would be a regular 5-cell, since (obviously) the number of cells and the number of hyperplanes don't add up. Besides, the intersection of the two 4-polytopes corresponding to the two sets of eight inequalities should technically correspond to the 16-cell. The tesseract, having eight cells, could be a candidate, but I have been unable to show that these eight inequalities define one (or any other 4-polytope). Any ideas ? Edit : I've discovered just now that 16-cells are four dimensional demihypercubes (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demihypercube ), and so they are analogous to tetrahedra in that two of them can be combined to obtain the 16 vertices of a tesseract. I am still interested to know what type of polytope corresponds to the eight inequalities above, however.","(x,y,z)

(When I say ""uniform grid"", think checkerboard...can be oriented any angle, but all elements must be squares) Part II Under what conditions is Part I true or false?

The grid has to be generated such that every marble coincides with a vertex of the checkboard. The boundaries do not bound the grid (they're only there to contain the marbles) Initially I was thinking that you have to relate it to the distance between the points. In which case, I would think that all distances would have to be a multiple of the smallest. Then I was thinking, what if the distances were primes? I don't think anything would work. Then I was thinking that the only possible case which would work for all, would be if the smallest distance was the diameter of the point. But then what is the diameter of a point if its just a point...therefore, the only possible grid would be the plane itself. I don't know if that would ""qualify"" as a grid, but I think you get my point. So we have some potential worst case and best case scenarios...I'm looking for more rigorous theorems or proofs which help answer these questions.

My thoughts/questions which follow are not meant to be rigorous...just trying to help convey what I'm looking for. Part I Given a set of unique points arbitrarily distributed over the domain , there exists a uniform grid in which all points coincide with a vertex of the grid. (When I say ""uniform grid"", think checkerboard...can be oriented any angle, but all elements must be squares) Part II Under what conditions is Part I true or false? (Maybe it's always true or always false) Part III If Part I is true, how does the edge length of the square element relate to the distribution of the points? Again, the specific questions aren't meant to be answered... I'm trying to find references to research further. EDIT The set of points would be finite. Imagine dumping a bucket of marbles on the floor of an empty room. Where the marbles stop, those are your points. The grid has to be generated such that every marble coincides with a vertex of the checkboard. The boundaries do not bound the grid (they're only there to contain the marbles) Initially I was thinking that you have to relate it to the distance between the points. In which case, I would think that all distances would have to be a multiple of the smallest. Then I was thinking, what if the distances were primes? I don't think anything would work. Then I was thinking that the only possible case which would work for all, would be if the smallest distance was the diameter of the point. But then what is the diameter of a point if its just a point...therefore, the only possible grid would be the plane itself. I don't know if that would ""qualify"" as a grid, but I think you get my point. So we have some potential worst case and best case scenarios...I'm looking for more rigorous theorems or proofs which help answer these questions. I just assumed they exist as the question is not that abstract.",\mathbb{R}^2,"['geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'optimization', 'finite-differences']"
65,Justification for expression for Convex Hull,Justification for expression for Convex Hull,,"I am new to convex hulls and I have encountered the following statement: Given a set of n points in a vector space $\{x_1 ... x_n \}$ , every point $x_0$ in the convex hull they form is obtained from the expression: $$ x_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i x_i$$ where $\alpha_i\geq0$ and $\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i=1$ , with different coefficients $\alpha_i$ giving different points, always within the convex hull. I have seen in this other answer a very clear example in $\mathbb R^2$ with only three points, for which the convex hull is just the convex combination of those three points, and corresponds to the points within the triangle formed by them. In $\mathbb R^2$ , but for $n$ points, the convex hull is just the set of all points inside the polygon formed by the ""outer"" points of the set - enclosing the rest of ""inner"" points.

Why would such inner points be included in the sums? Are perhaps their coefficients zero (i.e. $\alpha_i=0$ precisely for those ""inner"" points)?

97,Is this shape a fair D-24?,Is this shape a fair D-24?,,"I've been looking at polyhedra, incuding Platonic solids as well as Archimedean and Catalan solids. Catalan solids are face-transitive, which I believe implies that they are ""fair dice"", in the sense that each face is equally likely to land on top if the solid is ""rolled"" in some suitably non-biased fashion. There is a solid called a pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron, and it is not a Catalan solid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-deltoidal_icositetrahedron . It has the interesting property of being ""monohedral"" but not face-transitive. In other words, each face is the same polygon, but the symmetry group induces more than one orbit on the faces. In fact, there are two types of faces, symmetry-wise: polar faces (8) and equatorial faces (16). I'm wondering whether this shape is, nevertheless, a fair die. There are two Catalan solids having 24 faces (the deltoidal icosidetrahedron and the tetrakis hexahedron), so it is possible to make a fair D-24 from either of those. I'm just curious whether this is a third option. Note: I'm aware that this question comes up in the answers of a question on SO: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46684/fair-but-irregular-polyhedral-dice .

Catalan solids are face-transitive, which I believe implies that they are ""fair dice"", in the sense that each face is equally likely to land on top if the solid is ""rolled"" in some suitably non-biased fashion. There is a solid called a pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron, and it is not a Catalan solid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-deltoidal_icositetrahedron . It has the interesting property of being ""monohedral"" but not face-transitive. In other words, each face is the same polygon, but the symmetry group induces more than one orbit on the faces. In fact, there are two types of faces, symmetry-wise: polar faces (8) and equatorial faces (16). I'm wondering whether this shape is, nevertheless, a fair die. There are two Catalan solids having 24 faces (the deltoidal icosidetrahedron and the tetrakis hexahedron), so it is possible to make a fair D-24 from either of those. I'm just curious whether this is a third option. Note: I'm aware that this question comes up in the answers of a question on SO: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46684/fair-but-irregular-polyhedral-dice .
