1,Functional Derivative with Discrete Variable,Functional Derivative with Discrete Variable,,"Problem $$\text{Find}\quad\frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G} \quad \text{given} \quad F_k=\left(\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{ikr}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dt \ e^{i\omega t} G(r,t)\right)^{-1}$$ noting that $k$ and $r$ are discrete while $\omega$ and $t$ are continuous. Background I am trying to show that $F_k[G(r,t)]$ is very sensitive to perturbations in $G(r,t)$ . By numerical work I know this is (often) the case. Ultimately I'd like to argue that constructing $F_k$ by measuring $G(r,t)$ won't work well when the measurement is noisy. I figured a good way to show that was to compute the functional derivative and show it gets large (or perhaps diverges) in some places. However, I am doing something wrong. Attempt By the definition here : $$\frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G}:\int dt \frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G}\eta(t)=\left[\frac{d}{d\epsilon}\left(\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{ikr}\int dt \ e^{i\omega t} G(r,t)+\epsilon\eta(t)\right)^{-1}\right]_{\epsilon=0}$$ Using the chain rule, $\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{ikr}=N\delta_{k,0}$ i.e. the Kronecker delta, and the definition $G(k,\omega)\equiv\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{ikr}\int dt \ e^{i\omega t} G(r,t)$ transforms the above to $$\frac{-\int dt\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{i(kr+\omega t)}\eta(t)}{\left(\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} e^{ikr}\int dt \ e^{i\omega t} G(r,t)\right)^{2}}=\int dt\frac{-\delta_{k,0} \ e^{i\omega t}}{G(k,\omega)^2}\eta(t)\to \frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G(r,t)}=\frac{-\delta_{k,0} \ e^{i\omega t}}{G(k,\omega)^2}$$ I know this is wrong because this numerics show this isn't $0$ for all $k\neq 0$ . I suspect the problem has something to do with $\eta$ only depending on $t$ and not $r$ , but I'm not sure how to account for a discrete variable like $r$ . Resolution? I think my understanding of the definition above is likely wrong, and probably needs a test function that depends on both $r$ and $t$ ? I'd be pretty jazzed if the right way to do it looked something like $$\frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G}:\sum_{r=0}^{N-1}\int dt \frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G}\eta(r,t)=\left[\frac{d}{d\epsilon}F_k\left[G(r,t)+\epsilon\eta(r,t)\right]\right]_{\epsilon=0}$$ but my math is too weak to assert this is the right way, even though it looks like it makes some sense (to me). I really have no idea how to handle the fact that $r$ is discrete. If the above is correct, this would give $$ \frac{\delta F_k}{\delta G(r,t)}=\frac{-e^{i(\omega t+kr)}}{G(k,\omega)^2} $$ which is what I was hoping to show since $G(k,\omega)=0$ for at least one $\omega$ at every $k$ .

One of the problems in the book says as follows What is the value of $1 -\omega^h + \omega^{2h} -...+(-1)^{n-1} \omega^{(n-1)h}$ ? where $h$ is some integer and $ \omega = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{n}\right)$ , for some fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , is one of the $n$ -th roots of unity. The first thing I noticed is that I could write the series in terms of $-\omega^h$ as $$ 1 +\left(-\omega^h\right) + \left(-\omega^h\right)^2 +...+\left(-\omega^h\right)^{n-1} $$ Inspired by this, I separated the problem into 2 cases If $h$ is an integer of the form $ h = \frac{n(2k+1)}{2}$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ , then I get the following $$ -\omega^h = -\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}h\right) - i \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{n}h\right)= -\cos\left(\pi + 2\pi k\right) - i \sin \left(\pi + 2\pi k\right) = 1 $$ which means the sum evaluates to $\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 1 = n$ . If $-\omega^h \neq 1$ , then using the fact that the sum in question is a sum of the first $n$ terms in a geometric series, I can write $$ 1 -\omega^h + \omega^{2h} -...+(-1)^n \omega^{(n-1)h} = \frac{1 - \left(-\omega^h\right)^n}{1 - \left(-\omega^h\right)} = \frac{1 - (-1)^n\omega^{nh}}{1 +\omega^h}  $$ and since $h$ is an integer, I see that $$ \omega^{nh} = \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}nh\right) + i \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi}{n}nh\right) = \cos\left(2\pi h\right) + i \sin \left(2\pi h\right) = 1 $$ which means the sum simplifies to $\frac{1 - (-1)^n}{1 +\omega^h}$ .

What is the maximum of $u_x(0)$ ? My solution: first we assume that $U\supset\overline{D}$ is an open ball and $u:U\rightarrow[0,1]$ is harmonic on $U$ , then there exists an analytic function $f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ such that $\text{Re }f=u$ on $U$ . The Schwartz integral formula says $$f(z)=\int_0^{2\pi}u(\xi)\frac{\xi+z}{\xi-z}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}+iK$$ if $z\in D$ , where $\xi=e^{i\theta}$ and $K\in\mathbb{R}$ is a constant. We differentiate this with respect to $z$ , $$f'(z)=\int_0^{2\pi}u(\xi)\frac{2\xi}{(\xi-z)^2}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}.$$ Take $z=0$ , we have $$f'(0)=\int_0^{2\pi}u(\xi)\frac{2}{\xi}\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}.$$ Hence $$u_x(0)=\int_0^{2\pi}u(e^{i\theta})\cos\theta\,\frac{d\theta}{\pi}.$$ Since $u(e^{i\theta})\in[0,1]$ , the maximum of this integral is $\frac{2}{\pi}$ . If instead $u$ is a harmonic function from $D$ to $[0,1]$ , then what we have shown implies that for any $r\in(0,1),$ we have $ru_x(0)\leq\frac{2}{\pi}$ , therefore, $u_x(0)\leq\frac{2}{\pi}$ . This maximum can be attained: simply stipulate that $u(e^{i\theta})=1$ if $\theta\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$ and $u(e^{i\theta})=0$ if $\theta\in(\pi/2,3\pi/2)$ , then use the Poisson's formula with this boundary condition to find such $u$ .

42,Derivative of Contour Integral Representation of Step Function,Derivative of Contour Integral Representation of Step Function,,"The following is Problem 11.9 in ""Mathematical Physics: A Modern Introduction to Its Foundations, Second Edition"" by Sadri Hassani. Given the following representation of the step function: $$\theta(x) = \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{i t x}}{t-i\epsilon} \, dt, $$ show that $\theta'(x) = \delta(x)$ . This was a homework problem for an undergraduate physics class, but I (the grad student TA) am having trouble solving it rigorously. The derivative is clearly $$\theta'(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{t e^{itx}}{t-i\epsilon} \, dt,$$ which is essentially the usual Fourier representation of the Dirac delta function $$\delta(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{itx} \, dt.$$ However, the textbook has not introduced the Fourier transform yet, so this problem should be doable without using this representation. It is easy to show that $\theta'(x) = 0$ for $x>0$ and $x<0$ by coverting the integral over $t$ into a contour integral with a semicircular portion in the UHP for $x>0$ and LHP in the $x<0$ . One can also see that $\theta'(0)$ is infinite. Lastly, one can show that $\theta'(x)$ integrates to 1 over any region containing the origin. This is the answer that I will accept from the students. However, I would like to have a more rigorous derivation involving a test function. Here is my attempt. Let $$\theta_\epsilon(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{i t x}}{t-i\epsilon} \, dt $$ We wish to show $\displaystyle{\lim_{\epsilon\to 0} \theta_{\epsilon}'(x) = \delta(x)}$ . The derivative is: $$\theta_\epsilon'(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{it e^{itx}}{t-i\epsilon} \, dt $$ Let $g(x) \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})$ be a smooth test function (Schwartz function). We wish to show that $$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} A_\epsilon = g(0),$$ where $$ A_\epsilon \equiv \int_{-\infty}^\infty \theta_\epsilon'(x) g(x) \, dx.$$ We integrate and convert one of the integrals into a contour integral: \begin{align*} A_\epsilon &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{g(x) t e^{itx}}{t-i\epsilon} \, dt \, dx \\ & = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \underbrace{\int_{R} \frac{g(x)z e^{ixz}}{z-i\epsilon} \ dz}_{I_R} \, dx \end{align*} where $R$ is the contour of real numbers in $\mathbb{C}$ . By Jordan's lemma, the contour integral $I_R$ is: $$I_R = \left\{\begin{matrix} g(x) \cdot 2\pi i \cdot  i\epsilon e^{-\epsilon x} & x>0 \\ 0 & x<0 \end{matrix}\right.,$$ where we have closed the contour in the UHP or LHP for $x>0$ and $x<0$ , respectively. Thus: $$A_\epsilon = -\epsilon \int_0^\infty g(x) e^{-\epsilon x} \ dx $$ Integrating by parts: \begin{align*} A_\epsilon  &= -\epsilon \left[ -\frac{1}{\epsilon} e^{-\epsilon x} g(x)\Big|_0^\infty  + \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{0}^\infty e^{-\epsilon x} g'(x) dx \right] \\ & = -g(0) - \int_0^\infty e^{-\epsilon x} g'(x) \ dx \\ \end{align*} where we used the fact that $g\to 0$ as $x \to\infty$ . Examining the second term, we see that since $e^{-\epsilon x} g'(x)$ is dominated by $g'(x)$ on $[0,\infty)$ , we can use the Dominated Convergence Theorem to bring the $\epsilon \to 0$ limit inside the integral and find $$\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} A_\epsilon = -g(0) - \int_0^\infty g'(x) \, dx = -g(0) - g(x)\Big\vert_0^\infty = g(0) - g(0) = 0.$$ This is clearly not the desired result. I don't see anything wrong with the manipulations after the contour integral, so that step must be wrong. I guess splitting up the integral for $x>0$ and $x<0$ somehow misses the $x=0$ piece, which at the end of the day is the only piece that matters?

Does anyone know how to prove this? Thanks. Appendix: Proof of the forward direction (amp-to-phase). Referring to the contour below. By minimum phase, the transfer function $H$ has no zero at the lower half $\omega$ -plane, and thus $\ln{H(\omega)}$ is analytic there. Then by Cauchy integral theorem, we have $$\int_{C_P+C_R+C_0}\frac{\ln{H(\omega)}}{\omega^2-\Omega^2}d\omega=0$$ Integration along $C_0$ vanishes as the radius goes to infinity, because the denominator is second order.

This demands that the Lie derivative of $g$ be $$\mathfrak{L}_Xg=\alpha g.$$ Now, in components this is $$\nabla_\mu X_\nu+\nabla_\nu X_\mu=\alpha g_{\mu\nu}.$$ Now suppose that $D = 2$ and $g_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}$ . The resulting equations are the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $$\partial_1 X_2 = -\partial_2 X_1,\quad \partial_1 X_1 = \partial_2 X_2. \tag{1}$$ This I can understand. The problem is that one usually takes a big leap from here and says: That $\phi : M\to M$ must be a holomorphic or anti-holomorphic function; If we introduce complex coordinates on $M$ , $(z,\bar{z}) : U\subset M\to \mathbb{C}^2$ this means $\phi$ is either a function only of $z$ or only of $\bar{z}$ . That the algebra of the generators of conformal isometries is generated by $$\ell_n=-z^{n-1}\partial_z,\quad \bar{\ell}_n=-\bar{z}^{n-1}\partial_\bar{z}.$$ Now I fail to see how do we get from Eq. (1) to the two conclusions. All I know is that if the function $f : \mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ written $f(x,y) = u(x,y)+i v(x,y)$ has $u,v$ satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then $f$ is holomorphic . It is not the case here. What satisfies the Cauchy Riemann equations are the components of vector fields generators of conformal isometries , not the maps $\phi : M\to M$ themselves. Also, I fail to see why $\ell_n,\bar{\ell}_n$ are the generators. So how do we get from the vector fields satisfying the Cauchy Riemann equations to the conclusion that the finite diffeomorphisms are holomorphic/anti-holomorphic and that such vector fields are spanned by the $\ell_n,\bar{\ell}_n$ ?","I'm studying Conformal Field Theory via Paul Ginsparg's lecture notes and have a doubt regarding the Witt algebra.

My proof is as follows: The result is easy to verify for $n=2$ . (This part is solved in the textbook). We proceed by induction and assume the result for $n-1$ . If $z_n=0$ we are done anyway so we suppose $z_n\ne 0$ . Let $z_{i_1},\dots,z_{i_k}$ be all the nonzero complex numbers amongst $z_1,\dots,z_{n-1}$ . There must be at least one such nonzero number for otherwise the proof is trivial. Further let $z^*=z_{i_1}+\dots+z_{i_k}$ . Now suppose equality prevails in (1). Then, $$|z_{i_1}|+\dots+|z_{i_k}|+|z_n|=|z^*+z_n|\le |z^*|+|z_n|$$ following which $|z^*|\ge |z_{i_1}|+\dots+|z_{i_k}|.\tag 2$ Also by the triangle inequality we have $|z^*|\le |z_{i_1}|+\dots+|z_{i_k}|.\tag 3$ From (2),(3) we see that $$|z^*|=|z_{i_1}|+\dots+|z_{i_k}|.$$ This shows that $z_k/z_l\ge 0$ for any integers $k,l$ where $1\le k,l\le n-1$ for which $z_l\ne 0$ . Note that $z^*\ne 0$ for otherwise $z_{i_1}=\dots=z_{i_k}=0$ . Fix any $j$ , $1\le j\le k$ . By the induction hypothesis we now have $c_m=z_{i_m}/z_{i_j}>0$ where $1\le m\le k$ . Since $|z^*+z_n|=|z^*|+|z_n|$ so, by the case $n=2$ of the result we have $z_n=tz^*$ for some $t>0$ . Dividing both sides by $z_{i_j}$ we see that $$z_n/z_{i_j}=t(c_1+\dots+c_{j-1}+1+c_{j+1}+\dots+c_k)>0$$ following which $z_{i_j}/z_n>0$ . This completes one direction of the proof. Now suppose that for any $1\le p,q\le k$ we have $z_{i_p}/z_{i_q},z_{i_p}/z_n>0$ . Then $\frac{z_{i_1}+\dots+z_{i_k}}{z_n}>0$ and so both $z^*/z_n,z+n/z^*>0$ . Again, by the case $n=2$ this implies that $|z_n+z^*|=|z_n|+|z^*|$ . Hence, \begin{align*} |z_1+\dots+z_n|&=|z_{i_1}+\dots+z_{i_k}|+|z_n|\\ &=|z_{i_1}|+\dots+|z_{i_k}|+|z_n|\mbox{ (by the induction hypothesis)}\\ &=|z_1|+\dots+|z_n| \end{align*} which completes the proof.

Consider the space $\Omega^1(\mathbb H)$ of smooth complex $1$ -forms on $\mathbb H$ .  These consist of all smooth sections of $\mathbb H$ into the complexified tangent bundle of $\mathbb H$ , written formally as $$\omega = f(x,y)dx + g(x,y)dy$$ for $f, g$ smooth complex valued functions on $\mathbb H$ .  In particular, we have the holomorphic differential forms, given by $h(x,y)dz$ , where $dz = dx + i dy$ , and $h$ holomorphic on $\mathbb H$ . Since $\gamma$ induces a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb H$ to itself, it induces a diffeomorphism on the tangent bundle of $\mathbb H$ to itself, and therefore an automorphism of $\Omega^1(\mathbb H)$ . We can compute the effect of $\gamma$ on the form $dz$ .  I have seen the following done: $$\gamma.(dz) = d(\gamma(z)) = d( \frac{az+b}{cz+d}) = (\frac{az+b}{cz+d})'  = \frac{1}{(cz+d)^2}dz \tag{1}$$ I don't really understand what is going on here formally with differential forms.  How do we formally justify what is happening in (1)?  I did compute the action of $\gamma$ on $dz$ and got the same answer in another way: Another way : Let's consider the map $d \gamma$ on the tangent bundle.  With our chart, we can do this by computing the Jacobian of $\gamma$ .  Writing $\gamma(x,y) = u + iv$ , and using the fact that $\gamma$ is holomorphic and $v(z) = v(x+iy) = \frac{y}{|cz+d|^2}$ , we have by the Cauchy-Riemann equations that $$d \gamma = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix}  $$ The dual map on the contangent bundle is then given by the tranpose: $$\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \\ -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix}   \tag{2} $$ with $$\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = |cz+d|^{-3}(-4c^2x-4ycd)$$ $$\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = \frac{|cz+d|^2-2y^2c^2}{|cz+d|^4} $$ Now by (2), $d \gamma$ sends $dx$ to $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} dx - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}dy$ , and it sends $dy$ to $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} dy$ .  Therefore, $d \gamma$ sends $dz = dx + i dy$ to $$(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} dx - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}dy) + i(-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} dy) = (\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x})dz $$ This last expression, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ , is equal to $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u+iv) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\gamma(z)) = \gamma'(z)$ . This shows that $\gamma$ induces an automorphism on holomorphic $1$ -forms which sends $dz$ to $$dz \mapsto \gamma'(z)dz = \frac{1}{(cz+d)^2}dz$$ exactly as in (1).

Even complex multiplication is easier, a simple formula for that using only , and other basic operations, can be written like this: And for complex exponentiation it's a bit more complicated and complex (literally):",z = a+bi w = c+di s = z+w s \arg(s) |s| \arg(s) |s| z w \arg(s) \arg(z) \arg(w) |s| |z| |w| \arg(z) |z| |x| Arg(x) zw = |z||w|e^{(Arg(z)+Arg(w))i} z^w = \frac{|z|^{Re(w)}}{e^{Arg(z)Im(w)}}e^{(Arg(z)Re(w)+ln(|z|)Im(w))i},[]

We first recall that $f(w)=w^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is not continuous when $w<0$ . Using this, we can conclude that $PV(z-1)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is not continuous when $z<1$ and $PV(z+1)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is not continuous when $z<-1$ . Hence, $k(z)$ is not continuous when $z<1$ . Is this sufficient to determine that $k(z)$ is not differentiable on the interval $(-\infty, 1)$ , as $k(z)$ is not continuous for $z<1$ and not differentiable at $z=1$ (by inspection)?","Consider the function ( denotes the principal value ) Find where is continuous and differentiable, giving reasons.
