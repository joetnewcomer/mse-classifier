Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 10 years ago . Improve this question On a practice final exam for my Discrete Math class, I've been asked to prove that the sum of two positive integers is positive. I've been pulling my hair out over how to prove this, as it seems so obvious. I even asked some of my friends taking proof-based calculus, and they said that this was the type of thing that is just assumed to be true. Anyone have an idea of how to prove this? Any help is appreciated.",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing']"
22,Equivalence relation question with functions,Equivalence relation question with functions,,"We'll define on the set: $A=\Bbb R^{[0,1]}$ the relation $R$ by $fRg$ if $f(0)=g(0)$. Make sure it's an equivilence relation. What is $[\cos x]$  ? Describe all the equivalence classes and the quotient group $A/R$. Describe a subset of $A$, in it only one element exactly from each equivalence class (a system of representatives for the quotient group). Well, first of all to make sure I understand the notation, $A=\Bbb R^{[0,1]}$ means the set of all the functions from the section $[0,1]$ to the reals right ? And the relation is when two functions are equal when $x=0$. If it was from the reals to the section then some of these functions would be the trig functions, but the other way around I don't think it would be any elementary function. In order to prove this is an equivalence relation we need to check reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity, so for reflexivity I suppose it's enough to say that $f(0)=f(0)$, symmetry: $f(0)=g(0) \rightarrow g(0)=f(0)$ and transitivity:  $f(0)=g(0) \ , \ g(0)=h(0) \Rightarrow f(0)=h(0)$. What is $[\cos x]$ ? I'm not sure I understand the notation here... I suppose the equivalence classes are functions that equal $i\in \Bbb R$ when $X=0$ so there are $i$ equivalence classes. I have no idea how to describe $A/R$. That's basically every function because there can always be $fRf$. Please share your thoughts on what I did and how to solve this. Thanks.","We'll define on the set: $A=\Bbb R^{[0,1]}$ the relation $R$ by $fRg$ if $f(0)=g(0)$. Make sure it's an equivilence relation. What is $[\cos x]$  ?

Here is my proof so far: ${m,n\over \gcd(m,n)}$ is a common multiple of m and n . I am assuming that $q_m$ and $q_n$ are coprime. If $m = q_m \gcd(m,n)$ & $n = q_n \gcd(m,n)$, then ${m,n\over \gcd(m,n)}$ becomes ${q_m \gcd(m,n)q_n \gcd(m,n)\over \gcd(m,n)}$ which equals $q_m q_n \gcd(m,n)$.

Let there be a binary relation $R$ defined on a set $A$ . Now we suppose that $R$ be reflexive, symmetric and transitive. So we have for $a,b,c \in A$ $a R a$ (by the reflexive property of R) if $a R b$ then $b R a$ (by the symmetric property of R) if $a R b$ and $b R c$ then $aRc$ (by the transitive property of R) Intuitively we can satisfy ourselves with the fact that the above are the necessary conditions for $R$ to be equivalent. So ""if $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then $R$ is an equivalence relation"" Now working our intuition for equivalence relation $\sim$ we note the following. Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a set A, then for $a,b,c \in A$ we have, $a \sim a$ (by the intuitive knowledge of what $\sim$ means) if $a\sim b$ then $b \sim a$ (by the intuitive knowledge of what $\sim$ means) if $a\sim b$ and $b \sim c$ then $a\sim c$ (by the intuitive knowledge of what $\sim$ means) Now we see that (1) implies $\sim$ is reflexive, (2) implies that $\sim$ is symmetric and (3) implies that $\sim$ is transitive.

This definition makes quite sense unlike the book definition which says that if $R$ fails to be either reflexive or symmetric or transitive then $R$ may or may not be an equivalence relation, which after all gives a weird feeling.

One can ignore the last sentence, it's basically saying that in 6 people, there are either 3 mutual friends or 3 mutual enemies, which I completely understand already.
