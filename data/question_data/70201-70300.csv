2,How come the Euclidian distance for n-space involves only squares?,How come the Euclidian distance for n-space involves only squares?,,"I'm just beginning to learn topology, and there's something that I realize has been nagging at me since roughly the eight grade.

In 3-space, I visualize it like this: you want to find the distance $\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z$ so you: let $a = \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}$, $a$ is the distance along the $x, y$ plane the total distance is $\sqrt{a^2 + \Delta z^2}$ the above expands to $\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2}$ To generalize, faced with $n$ dimensions, you pick two, find the distance along those two dimensions, plop a point down there, and repeat (until you have only one dimension left, at which point you're done.)

The set of sets defined by $ \mathcal{W}=\{U_x\cap A \} $ for all $ x\in A $ is an open covering of $ A $. Since $ A $ is a closed set in a Lindelöf space, $ A $ is Lindelöf as well by the previous problem and there exists a countable subcollection $ \mathcal{A} $ of $ \mathcal{W} $ that covers $ A $. Let $ U_0 $ be the intersection of all sets of $ \mathcal{A} $ and let $ V_0 $ be the intersection of all $ V_x $ corresponding to the sets of $ \mathcal{A} $. Since $ U_x\cap V_x=\emptyset $ for all $ x\in A $, it is clear that $ U_0\cap V_0=\emptyset $. Also, since a countable intersection of open sets is open, $ U_0 $ and $ V_0 $ are both open. Since $ V\subseteq V_x $ for each $ x\in A $, $ V\subseteq V_0 $ as well. In summary, $ U_0 $ and $ V_0 $ are disjoint open sets containing $ A $ and $ B $, respectively, and hence $ X $ is normal. Question: Is my proof correct? I think it has a couple of mistakes. Can I be sure that every set in $\mathcal{W}$ is open in $A$? And it is simply wrong that a countable intersection of open sets is open, right? How can I correct my proof, and is there a different and better proof?",,"['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory', 'separation-axioms']"

What does it mean? I agree that all element of $\mathcal T$ are in $\mathscr B$, and also all element of  $$\{Y\mid \exists U\in\mathcal T: Y=X\backslash U\}$$ by definition of a $\sigma-$algebra, but I know that there is a lot of other set, for exemple, let take the measurable set $(\mathbb R,\mathscr M,m)$ where $m$ is the Lebesgue measure and $\mathbb R$ provide with it's usual topology. Why $[1,2[$ is in the Borel set ? 2) A consequence of the first question, how to prove in general that a set is in the Borel set (excepted if it's an open or a close set, it's clearly obvious) ? 3) What is the fantastic side of this set ? Evry body talks about the Borel set like something gorgeous, where is the genius there ? 4) Does the Borel set of $(X,\mathscr M,\mu)$ depend of $\mu$ ? Or only of the Lebesgue measure ?

Then I saw the following Quora link and Qiaochu's illustrative answer . It was great to see the motivation behind the concept of manifold. Then I looked at the definition of manifold that I have at my disposal which is the following: A topological space $M$ is an $n$-dimensional real manifold if there is a family of subsets $U_\alpha$, $\alpha \in A$, of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and a quotient map $f \colon \coprod_\alpha U_\alpha \to M$ such that $f|_{U_\alpha}$ is a homeomorphism onto the image for all $\alpha$. I understand that we are trying to conceptualize about a bigger space which when looked at a very small region looks like something else (a euclidean space) thereby giving a possibly incorrect bigger picture about the shape. Now what was the reason behind introducing disjoint union in this definition. Can someone help me to get in terms with this idea? I went through this related question and Samuel's brilliant answer to it. Leaving aside the points about Haussdorff and second countable spaces I could draw that homeomorphism is the concept that we use to convey the similarity between two spaces. I can loosely convince myself that the existence of homeomorphism between two spaces means the similarity in the pattern of open sets in the two spaces. (I might not be expressing what I feel about it.) But still then can anyone make it a bit more elaborate as to why we use homeomorphism here? If we divided this bigger surface, let's say earth into smaller circles, then I can see that we wouldn't have gotten the local shape same everywhere, somewhere it would have been a circle and some other points it would have been an area in between four circles or maybe something else. But are these local shapes homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$? What are other shapes which wouldn't have been homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$? I guess "" What happens when two spaces are homeomorphic ?"" would be a good way to start the discussion.","I was going thorough the definition of a manifold and needless to say it wasn't something that I could digest at one go.
