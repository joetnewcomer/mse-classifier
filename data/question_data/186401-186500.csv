Let $a,b \in X$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$ but $a \not =b$. Now since this is a finite set mapping to itself then there are not enough elements in $X$ to map to $X$ since two elements were used to map to one element, thus the function can't be surjective.

This plot is usually represented by a line, e.g. $f(x)=x$ is represented by a straight line. Now consider a section of this line, e.g. $f(x)=x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 10$. Measuring the length of this line is trivial by using the Pythagorean Theorem or the Distance Formula, etc. Now consider a graph of a semicircle.

I can think of no direct way to find the length of this line for some interval on $x$. Is there a way? I can propose a way, which, to me, seems intuitively related to Riemann Integration.

Similarly, one ought to be able to find the length of a line on some interval by fitting arbitrarily many right-angled triangles with equal width on the curve: this way, we can partition a curve into arbitrarily many lines that are approximately straight, which we can measure by finding the hypotenuses of our triangles. Then to find the length of the curve, we just sum those hypotenuses.

Clearly, as we let the size of the triangle base $a$ become arbitrarily small, our approximation of the length of the curve will become more accurate.

One solution, though messy, is to use the following derivation: We work backwards. Let $f = f_e + f_0$ , where $f_e$ is even and $f_0$ odd. Then $f(x) = f_e (x) + f_0 (x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ . But then $$ f(-x) = f_e (-x) + f_0 (-x) = f_e (x) - f_0 (x). $$ Adding, we eliminate $f_0 (x)$ : $$  f(x) + f(-x) = 2f_e (x), $$ so $$ f_e (x) = \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2}. $$ Now, $f_0 = f(x) - f_e$ . Then: $$  f_0 (x) = f(x) - \frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2} = \frac{2f(x) - f(x) - f(-x)}{2} = \frac{f(x) -f(-x)}{2}. $$ One easily checks that $f_e$ is even and $f_0$ odd. Using this derivation, I get: \begin{align*} \frac{1-x}{1+x} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x} + \frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1-x}{1+x} - \frac{1+x}{1-x}  \right). \end{align*} Assuming I haven't made an algebra mistake, this seems to work, but it's not elegant.

First, I'll just present it. \begin{align*} \frac{1-x}{1+x} & = \frac{1-x}{1+x} \cdot \frac{1-x}{1-x} \\ & = \frac{1 - 2x + x^2}{1 - x^2} \\ & = \frac{x^2 + 1}{1 - x^2} + \frac{2x}{1 - x^2}. \end{align*} One then checks that the first function is even and the second is odd. My problem with this solution is that it is not valid for every $x$ in the domain of $f$ . By definition, the domain of $f$ is $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{-1\}$ . But this solution, in multiplying by $\frac{1-x}{1-x}$ , presupposes that $x \neq 1$ , which does not seem to me to be allowed. I'm back at square one, then, because the solution I found does not seem in any way elegant or natural, and I'm assuming there is some kind of a trick that I am missing.
