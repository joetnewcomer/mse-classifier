21,"Does there exist an infinite sequence of complex numbers $\{a_i\}$, all of whose powers sum to zero?","Does there exist an infinite sequence of complex numbers , all of whose powers sum to zero?",\{a_i\},"Does there exist an infinite sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots \in \mathbb{C}$ such that for all integers $k \ge 1$ , we have $$\sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} a_i^k = 0?$$ The statement is true if the $a's$ are absolutely convergent, but this question is about if we relax absolute convergence and only have conditional. If we instead take a finite sequence and sufficiently many powers are zero, then indeed they are all zero, but this method can't work in the infinite case. [If you truncate the series at $a_1\dots a_n$ and only have $n$ equations, there is no guarantee the RHS will be small, and even if there was, there is no guarantee that the coefficients $e_i$ of the polynomial will be small, and even if there was, a polynomial with small coefficients can still have large roots that do not approach zero (eg. $x^n - 1/2^n$ has roots $x = 1/2$ .)] In the style of this excellent video, you could ask if the set of vectors $v_2 = (a_2^1, a_2^2, \dots), v_3 = (a_3^1, a_3^2, \dots)$ , each of which is in $l_2$ , can be linearly combined to produce $v_1 = (-a_1^1, -a_1^2, \dots)$ . Per the video the answer is indeed yes! - but this does not guarantee that the linear combination will be of equal weights $v_1 = 1\cdot v_2 + 1\cdot v_3 + \dots$ . [Actually, an equal weight sum of vectors in $l_2$ is not necessarily even in $l_2$ itself - eg., if $v_i$ is the vector of all zeros except for position $i$ which is 1, then $v$ is a vector of all 1s, which is not in $l_2$ .] To try to use complex analysis, it's pretty clear that for any analytic (on the unit disc?) function $f(z) = \sum_{j = 1}^{\infty} c_j z^j$ for which $f(0) = 0$ , then $\sum_i^{\infty} f(a_i) = 0$ . Or, if you want to remove the $f(0) = 0$ condition, for all analytic functions $g$ , we have $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a_i g(a_i) = 0$ . This works for ANY g! Surely at this point it should be obvious that the $a_i$ s must be zero, but alas I can't see it. The same would hold if $a_i$ was replaced with $\overline{a_i}$ , so that $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\overline{a_i} g(\overline{a_i}) = 0$ . But I don't think this gets us anywhere, since we already know that $a_i$ converges to zero, so we can't use some trick to show that for some $s$ , then $g(s) = 0$ for all $s$ , contradiction, so all $a_i$ are zero. And we have a fixed set of $a_i$ , so we can't move them around to such an $s$ and obtain that $g(s) = 0$ . And we have to use analytic functions - the Unit Disc Stone Weierstrass theorem says that $f(z)$ can be approximated by a polynomial $p(z, \overline{z})$ , a polynomial in two variables $z, \overline{z}$ . This makes things hard - because we don't have any information on the magnitudes of $a_i$ other than that (WLOG) they are less than 1. Actually, if the $a_i$ s were real numbers (and we eschew the trivial inequality to finish our proof immediately, haha), the  usual Stone Weierstrass would almost give a slick proof, but not quite. If we use the same polynomial $p$ to approximate an arbitrary continuous function $f$ , so that $|p(x)-f(x)| \le \epsilon$ for all $x$ , we'd have the same absolute error bound but an infinite number of terms, so the infinite sum $0 = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} p(a_i)$ would not be close to $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(a_i)$ as is true in the finite case. If we ignore this issue anyway and assume that $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f(a_i)$ is small, then we can construct a neighborhood $[-\epsilon, \epsilon]$ around zero which contains all but a finite nonzero number of the $a_i$ at the beginning of the sequence; then we can construct a continuous function which is zero on this neighborhood but equal to one everywhere else, and we'd obtain a contradiction (the sum would be strictly positive and more than one, vs close to 0), showing that no such interval exists, and thus all the $a_i$ have to be equal, and then it follows that $a_i = 0$ for all $i$ . I wonder if there is a nonzero solution where the $a_i$ are only conditionally convergent but not absolutely. On the other hand, from the vectors idea above, I think a nonzero solution is impossible because we have a uniform summation of the powers of $a_i$ , which would prevent the resulting sum from lying in $l_2$ like $v_1 = (-a_1^1, -a_1^2, \dots)$ does.","Does there exist an infinite sequence such that for all integers , we have The statement is true if the are absolutely convergent, but this question is about if we relax absolute convergence and only have conditional.

27,Prime one heap Nim,Prime one heap Nim,,"I have been working on an interesting problem my lecturer mentioned recently. Prime Nim is a variant of the Nim game where you have a single pile with an arbitrary number $n\in \Bbb N+\{0\}$ of elements and players can take away a prime count of elements every round. Now I want to find a way to decide whether we can ensure victory in a given position (and the winning strategy, of course). What I did so far: $0$ and $1$ are clearly lost positions. On the contrary, any prime $n$ and $n+1$ are winning positions. For all other $n$ we can say that if there is no prime $p<n$ such that $n-p \notin \{n'|n'<n \land n' \text{ is lost}\}$ , then $n$ is a losing position. The set of losing positions can be more formally expressed recursively based on previous such sets for smaller $n$ . (In other words, this is an application of the very basic idea that a position form which we can make no move to a losing position is a losing position). All other positions are winning positions. Very simple and general. Losing positions can be described as a sequence - http://oeis.org/A025043 (quite interestingly a subsequence of http://oeis.org/A093513 ). This uses the recursive nature of the problem. An algorithm starting from the recursion edge case ( $0$ ) and building up the sequence progressively can give us both the answer and the prospective winning strategy generated as a side-product in polynomial time. My lecturer said the strategy-finding algorithm is probably optimal, but he also suggested there might be a simple formula to decide whether a given position can be won using an optimal strategy. And I am stuck on it now. I guess the formula can't possibly be that simple, since it has to, in my opinion, include at least primality testing. I tried to determine a simple way to decide whether a number is in the sequence of losing positions, but I had no success so far. Basically, I always encounter the impenetrable problem of generating $n$ th prime.

I already showed that: $p$ is well defined in $l_\infty$ $p(\alpha x)=\alpha p(x)$, for all $x\in l_\infty$ and $\alpha >0$ $p$ is subadditive, i.e $p(x+y)\leq p(x)+p(y)$, for all $x,y\in l_\infty$ This part I'm not sure that it's the best way to do it: To obtain a functional as the problem states, I defined first another functional $g:c\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ ($c$={space of convergent sequences}), given by: $$ g((x_n)_n) = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} x_n $$ It was not difficult to show that: $g$ is linear $g(x)\leq p(x)$, for all $x\in c$.

My Difficulties: (2) I managed to demonstrate this one, but I'm not sure I'm correct, this is my solution: For every $x\in l_\infty$ we have $$ f(x) \leq p(x) = \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} $$ So we have \begin{align} -f(x) = f(-x) \leq p(x) &= \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k (-x_{n+i_j})\right) \right\}\\ &= \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\}\\ &= \inf\left\{-\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\}\\ &= -\sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} \end{align} From which we get $$ f(x) \geq \sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} $$ And clearly if $x_n\geq 0$ for all $n$, then $$ f(x) \geq \sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} \geq 0 $$ Is this correct? (3) This is my biggest problem, I have little clue on how to show this, it is clear that in $c$ it is valid.

(Actually we'll have $g(x)=p(x)$) $g((1,1,1,\ldots))=1$ Now, the Hahn Banach Extension Theorem states that there is a functional $f:l_\infty\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that: $f(x)=g(x)$, for all $x\in c$ $f(x)\leq p(x)$, for all $x\in l_\infty$ Now I just have to show that $f$ satisfies the conditions given by the problem, which are: $f(x)=1$ if $x_n= 1$ for all $n$ $f(x)\geq 0$ if $x_n\geq 0$ for all $n$ $f((x_2,x_3,\ldots))=f((x_1,x_2,\ldots))$ (1) is straightforward, since the condition is valid for $g$. My Difficulties: (2) I managed to demonstrate this one, but I'm not sure I'm correct, this is my solution: For every $x\in l_\infty$ we have $$ f(x) \leq p(x) = \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} $$ So we have \begin{align} -f(x) = f(-x) \leq p(x) &= \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k (-x_{n+i_j})\right) \right\}\\ &= \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\}\\ &= \inf\left\{-\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\}\\ &= -\sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} \end{align} From which we get $$ f(x) \geq \sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} $$ And clearly if $x_n\geq 0$ for all $n$, then $$ f(x) \geq \sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} \geq 0 $$ Is this correct? (3) This is my biggest problem, I have little clue on how to show this, it is clear that in $c$ it is valid. I have the feeling that using the following inequality I can get somewhere: $$ \sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} \leq f(x) \leq \inf\left\{\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\} $$ but I haven't been able to do much. If we define  $$q(x)=\sup\left\{\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\left(\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k x_{n+i_j}\right) \right\}$$ I have no trouble in noticing that: \begin{align} p((x_2,x_3,\ldots))=p((x_1,x_2,\ldots))\\ q((x_2,x_3,\ldots))=q((x_1,x_2,\ldots)) \end{align} If we had $p(x)=q(x)$ then it would be done, but I think this is not the case.

Fo example I assume a function $f(x)$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle \exp(x) =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ $\qquad \qquad$ (where the circle-notation means iteration, and $f^{\circ 0}=x, f^{\circ 1}(x)=f(x)$) and first I ask: what does this function $f(x)$ look like? What I'm doing is this substitution: $$ \small \begin{array} {lrll} 1.& \exp(x) & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\ 2.& \exp(f(x))&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\   \\  \\ 3.& {\exp(f(x))\over \exp(x) } & = & \frac 1x \\ \\ & \exp(f(x)) & = & &{ \exp(x) \over x} \\ \\ \\  4. & f(x)&=& x & - \log(x) \end{array} $$ $ \qquad \qquad $ (From 1. and 4. I know, that x is now restricted to $x \gt 0$) As some comments point out, the construction of the function $f(x)$ is underdetermined; so in step $3.$ numerator and denominator can have a common factor $c$ such that we'll have $$ \small \begin{array} {lrll} 1a.& \exp(x)\cdot c & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\ 2a.& \exp(f(x)) \cdot c&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots   \end{array} $$ If I do now the computation with some example $x$ by  $$ y =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots $$ I get for all tested $x>0$ the result $$ y = \exp(x) / \exp(1)  $$ such that indeed a cofactor $c$ occurs and that it is precisely $1 / \exp(1)$ Q1: Where does this additional factor in the empirical evaluation come from? Where have the above analytical steps missed some crucial information? The question can made more precise: Q2: How does the empiricial computation determine, that the cofactor $c$ is just $1/\exp(1)$ ? (The comments of @Eric Wong adress this questions, but I've not yet made it explicite) In reviewing my own question, a generalization is possible in that I can use any base $b$ with $\log(b)\ge 1$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle {b^x \over b} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ and the constant $c$ comes always out to equal $1/b$ such that we might as well  write $ \qquad \displaystyle b^{x-1} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ Q3: Can Eric's comment made be more explicite such that it shall work for all that bases? I observe, that for $\eta < \log(b) <1$ with $\eta \lt 0.39996 $ the sequence of iterates of the functions $f_b(x)$ either approach $1$ alternating from below and above or don't approach $1$ at all but approach distinct accumulation-points...

Fo example I assume a function $f(x)$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle \exp(x) =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ $\qquad \qquad$ (where the circle-notation means iteration, and $f^{\circ 0}=x, f^{\circ 1}(x)=f(x)$) and first I ask: what does this function $f(x)$ look like? What I'm doing is this substitution: $$ \small \begin{array} {lrll} 1.& \exp(x) & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\ 2.& \exp(f(x))&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\   \\  \\ 3.& {\exp(f(x))\over \exp(x) } & = & \frac 1x \\ \\ & \exp(f(x)) & = & &{ \exp(x) \over x} \\ \\ \\  4. & f(x)&=& x & - \log(x) \end{array} $$ $ \qquad \qquad $ (From 1. and 4. I know, that x is now restricted to $x \gt 0$) As some comments point out, the construction of the function $f(x)$ is underdetermined; so in step $3.$ numerator and denominator can have a common factor $c$ such that we'll have $$ \small \begin{array} {lrll} 1a.& \exp(x)\cdot c & = &x & \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots  \\ 2a.& \exp(f(x)) \cdot c&= && f^{\circ 1}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 2}(x) & \cdot f^{\circ 3}(x) & \cdots   \end{array} $$ If I do now the computation with some example $x$ by  $$ y =  x \cdot f^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots $$ I get for all tested $x>0$ the result $$ y = \exp(x) / \exp(1)  $$ such that indeed a cofactor $c$ occurs and that it is precisely $1 / \exp(1)$ Q1: Where does this additional factor in the empirical evaluation come from? Where have the above analytical steps missed some crucial information? The question can made more precise: Q2: How does the empiricial computation determine, that the cofactor $c$ is just $1/\exp(1)$ ? (The comments of @Eric Wong adress this questions, but I've not yet made it explicite) In reviewing my own question, a generalization is possible in that I can use any base $b$ with $\log(b)\ge 1$ such that $ \qquad \displaystyle {b^x \over b} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ and the constant $c$ comes always out to equal $1/b$ such that we might as well  write $ \qquad \displaystyle b^{x-1} =  x \cdot f_b^{\circ 1}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 2}(x)\cdot f_b^{\circ 3}(x)\cdots   $ Q3: Can Eric's comment made be more explicite such that it shall work for all that bases? I observe, that for $\eta < \log(b) <1$ with $\eta \lt 0.39996 $ the sequence of iterates of the functions $f_b(x)$ either approach $1$ alternating from below and above or don't approach $1$ at all but approach distinct accumulation-points...

48,Split up $n \in \mathbb{N}$ into sum of naturals with maximum LCM,Split up  into sum of naturals with maximum LCM,n \in \mathbb{N},"Question : Given some natural number, we can of course split it up into various sums of other naturals (e.g. $7 = 6 + 1 = 1 + 4 + 2 = \ldots$) More precisely, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we can a find distribution sequence (or partition ) $s_0,\ldots,s_u \in \mathbb{N}$ with $$\sum_{i=0}^{u}s_i = n$$ Now how can I find the partition $s$ for which the overall least common multiple of all elements is maximal. Or differently formulated the maximum product of distinct prime factors of all elements. Example: $$ 7 \mapsto (3, 4); \Pi_{lcm} = 12 $$ $$ 7 \mapsto (1, 2, 4); \Pi_{lcm} = 4$$  $$ \ldots $$ Here, the first solution is the desired one. Background: The background of my question is: How can I split up a sequence/string into contiguous subsequences that, when repeated and zipped together , will yield the longest possible resulting sequence. For the above example, I could split up a string of length $7$ in the following way: 7: abcdefg 7:  abcdefg      I              II 1: aaaa    3: abcabcabcabc 2: bcbc    4: defgdefgdefg 4: defg Of course, using the second distribution, the resulting sequence has a much greater period. So: What algorithm/approach can I use to solve this problem and maximize the product? Is this some known problem and how complex would calculating a solution be? It's not NP, I hope?! Edit: Partial solution As @KennyTM pointed out in the comments, Landau's function $g$ describes the maximum LCM, i.e. $g(7) = 12$. So this actually becomes: How to actually produce the partition?

It seems that this property holds for any starting integer values $(u_1,u_2)$ . Does anyone see how to prove it? Proof of the equivalence. If $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u_{n+1}}{u_{n}}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=\phi$ and since we have $\frac{n}{u_{n-1}}\rightarrow0$ then we get $$\frac{1+\frac{u_{n-2}}{u_{n-1}}+\frac{n}{u_{n-1}}}{\gcd\left(u_{n-1},u_{n-2},n\right)}	\sim\frac{1}{\gcd\left(u_{n-1},u_{n-2},n\right)}\left(1+\frac{1}{\varPhi}\right)\sim\varPhi\ \left(n\rightarrow\infty\right)$$ and necessarily we have $\gcd\left(u_{n-1},u_{n-2},n\right)\rightarrow1$ . Since it is an integer value it must be $1$ for $n$ large enough. In the other way if $\gcd\left(u_{n-1},u_{n-2},n\right)=1$ for $n>n_{0}$ then we have for $n>n_{0}$ $$u_{n}=u_{n-1}+u_{n-2}+n$$ and $u_{n}=a\varPhi^{n}+b\varPhi^{-n}+cn+d$ for some constants $(a,b,c,d)$ with $a>0$ . I add that if we replace $n$ with a function $f(n)$ sufficiently regular like $f(n)=n^2$ i.e. $u_{n}=\frac{u_{n-1}+u_{n-2}+f(n)}{\gcd\left(u_{n-1},u_{n-2},f(n)\right)}$ the property seems to persist.

50,Proof verification: $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}=\frac{\pi}{4}$,Proof verification:,\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}=\frac{\pi}{4},"While exploring the various applications of integral reduction formulae, I stumbled into what I believe to be a beautiful elementary proof of the equality $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}=\frac{\pi}{4}$$ I'd greatly appreciate it if someone took the time to review it! To arrive at the desired result, we'll need to establish the following: Lemma : For all $n\geq 1$ , $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n}(x)dx=(-1)^n\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)$$ We use mathematical induction to do this. The base case $n=1$ can be proven as follows: \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^2(x)\text{ }dx &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left[\sec^2(x)-1\right]dx\\ &= \left[\tan(x)-x\right]_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\\ &= 1-\frac{\pi}{4}\\ &= -\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-1\right)\\ &= (-1)^1\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{0}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= (-1)^1\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{1-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right) \end{align*} Thus, the equality holds for $n=1$ . If it holds for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ , then it follows that \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2(m+1)}(x)\text{ }dx &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m+2}(x)\text{ }dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m}(x)\tan^2(x)\text{ }dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m}(x)\left[\sec^2(x)-1\right]dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left[\tan^{2m}(x)\sec^2(x)-\tan^{2m}(x)\right]dx\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m}(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-(-1)^m\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right) \end{align*} Here, we make the substitution $u=\tan(x)$ . This gives \begin{align*} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2m}(x)\sec^2(x)\text{ }dx-(-1)^m\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right) &= \int_{0}^{1}u^{2m}\text{ }du-(-1)^m\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= \frac{1}{2m+1}-(-1)^m\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= \frac{(-1)^m(-1)^m}{2m+1}-(-1)^m\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= (-1)^m\left(\frac{(-1)^m}{2m+1}-\frac{\pi}{4}+\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= (-1)^m\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}+\sum_{k=0}^{m}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\\ &= (-1)^{m+1}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{(m+1)-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right) \end{align*} This shows that the equality is true for $n=m+1$ . Thus, mathematical induction implies that it is true for all $n\geq 1$ . With that settled, notice that \begin{align*} \left|\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right| &= \left|(-1)^n\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)\right|\\ &= \left|\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n}(x)\text{ }dx\right|\\ &= \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n}(x)\text{ }dx \end{align*} because $\tan^{2n}(x)\geq 0$ . We now obtain an upper bound for the integral $\int_{0}^{\pi/4}\tan^{2n}(x)dx$ . Making the substitution $x=\tan^{-1}(u)$ gives $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\tan^{2n}(x)\text{ }dx=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{u^{2n}}{1+u^2}du$$ It's clear that $u^{2n}/(1+u^2)< u^{2n}$ except when $u=0$ , so $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{u^{2n}}{1+u^2}du< \int_{0}^{1}u^{2n}\text{ }du=\frac{1}{2n+1}$$ Thus, we have that $$\left|\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right|<\frac{1}{2n+1}$$ and since $1/(2n+1)\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ , it immediately follows from the squeeze theorem that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\right)=0$$ which is equivalent to $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n+1}=\frac{\pi}{4}$ . $\blacksquare$ Let me know what you think! Edit : This is harmless, but should still be addressed: the inequality $u^{2n}/(1+u^2)<u^{2n}$ should have been $u^{2n}/(1+u^2)\leq u^{2n}$ , since $u^{2n}/(1+u^2)$ and $u^{2n}$ are equal if and only if $u=0$ . The inequality of integrals is still strict, though.","While exploring the various applications of integral reduction formulae, I stumbled into what I believe to be a beautiful elementary proof of the equality I'd greatly appreciate it if someone took the time to review it!

56,Number of distinct angles that can be formed on a square grid,Number of distinct angles that can be formed on a square grid,,"Given a set of grid points arranged in an $n$ by $n$ square (in 2 dimensions): How many distinct proper (acute or obtuse) angles can be formed having a vertex on one grid point and line segments ending on two other grid points? For example, on a $2 \times 2$ grid you can form only $2$ distinct angles,  with cosines equal to $0$ (for example $\angle (0,0)(0,1)(1,1)$)  and $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. (I find it convenient to classify the angles by their cosines, because the law of cosines lets you easily get the cosine of each angle of a triangle on the grid.) On a $3 \times 3$ grid, by adding that layer of 5 more points, you can form an additional $8$ distinct angles, with  $$\cos \alpha \in \{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}},\frac{3}{5},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}, \frac{4}{5}, - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}   \}  $$ Here I have arranged these values in an order that came from the following reasoning:  To make a new angle, you must make a triangle with two vertices more that $n-1$ apart in either the horizontal or the vertical direction (or both.  So I start with one point at the upper left grid point, slide a second point along the opposite edge, and work my way through all combinations of on point on each of two opposite edges.  For each  such combination, the third point can in principle be on any of the remaining grid points. A very crude upper limit can be estimated  by saying there are $\binom{n^2}{3}$ possible triangles, thus   $3 \binom{n^2}{3}\approx \frac{n^6}{2}$ angles; but of course most of those angles will duplicate each other. By considering the ordering described above, one eliminates a number of angles that are just translations, flips, or $90^\circ$ rotations of others already counted. Here, the naive upper limit for the added angles would be $3$ for the angles in a triangle, times $\binom{n+1}{2}$ for the ways to choose the two edge vertices, divided by $2$ to account for flips about the horizontal center of the square, times $(n^2-2)$ internal points.  That gives a naive upper limit of about $\frac{3n^4}{4}$ points added when the square side increases from $n-1$ to $n$, thus a naive upper limit of  $$ \Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{3n^5}{20} $$ But that is also much too large.  Some triangles are duplicates because of: Much of the time, one or two of the angles in a new large triangle overlays an angle that can fit in a smaller grid. Any time the third vertex of the triangle lies below the first vertex, the whole triangle can be translated upward such that the first vertex lies on a corner. Symmetry that we have not yet discounted for (for example, some triangles are isosceles [although noe will be equilateral]). A side of a triangle passes through a grid point, allowing an angle to have been created on a smaller grid even though the triangle at hand is large.  The counting of these cases involves the totient function. A triangle is similar to some other smaller triangle in some obvious way involving $45^\circ$ rotations. When a side that is neither horizontal nor vertical happens to have integer length due to Pythagorean relationships, angles involving that side are usually duplicated in other triangles with a horizontal or vertical side of that length. There are some numerical ""coincidences"" that cannot be anticipated by accounting for those other effects. This is fundamentally a number theory problem. Although I originally suspected that the number of distinct angles grows like $n^4$, I have not been able to show this, nor get a handle on what the coefficient would be.  I do know that for modest values of $n$, the growth  appears to be much slower than this, perhaps as slow as $n^3$. $\Bbb{A}(4)$ Appears to be $2 + 8 + 18 = 28$. I'm pretty sure that pattern breaks down  by $\Bbb{A}(5)$. Any progress or solution on this would be appreciated. Added after a few days: I have tightened the upper limit:  Since any triangle touching the right and left sides can be translated and possibly flipped so that it has one vertex on the upper left corner and one on the right side, and since among those triangles the ones with the third vertex above the line joining the sides replicate triangles with the third vertex below that line, the upper limit, ignoring symmetries, coincidences, and so forth, is just $\frac{3n^2}{16}$ new angles for layer $n$. Thus  $$ \Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{3n^4}{16} $$ I did an automated computation of $\Bbb{A}(n)$ for $n \leq 100$ and observe that  $$ \Bbb{A}(n) \leq \frac{n^4}{8} $$ and that it appears to approach that limit. The numbers in the sequence for $n = 2$ through $10$ are $$ \begin{array}{ll} 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 10 \\ 4 & 28 \\ 5 & 66 \\ 6 & 154 \\ 7 & 269 \\ 8 & 473 \\ 9 & 781 \\ 10 & 1156 \end{array} $$ I want to submit this as a new sequence in OEIS, but I won't until somebody else has confirmed my results by their own calculation, at least for ten more values of $n$.  To be confident that this is a confirmation, I am not displaying the number of angles for  all further values of $n$, but I will say that $\Bbb{A}(21) = 23640$,  $\Bbb{A}(50) = 759308$, and $\Bbb{A}(100) = 12335703$,. To increase the chances of somebody providing the verification I need,, I am offering a bounty for even the values of $\Bbb{A}(n)$ from $10 < n < 21$. Agreement in those ten numbers will tell me that my program was correct, and I will submit this to the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences. Of course, any substantial theoretical work toward an actual understanding of the sequece would also earn the bounty!","Given a set of grid points arranged in an $n$ by $n$ square (in 2 dimensions): How many distinct proper (acute or obtuse) angles can be formed having a vertex on one grid point and line segments ending on two other grid points?

The numbers in the sequence for $n = 2$ through $10$ are $$ \begin{array}{ll} 2 & 2 \\ 3 & 10 \\ 4 & 28 \\ 5 & 66 \\ 6 & 154 \\ 7 & 269 \\ 8 & 473 \\ 9 & 781 \\ 10 & 1156 \end{array} $$ I want to submit this as a new sequence in OEIS, but I won't until somebody else has confirmed my results by their own calculation, at least for ten more values of $n$.  To be confident that this is a confirmation, I am not displaying the number of angles for  all further values of $n$, but I will say that $\Bbb{A}(21) = 23640$,  $\Bbb{A}(50) = 759308$, and $\Bbb{A}(100) = 12335703$,. To increase the chances of somebody providing the verification I need,, I am offering a bounty for even the values of $\Bbb{A}(n)$ from $10 < n < 21$. Agreement in those ten numbers will tell me that my program was correct, and I will submit this to the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences. Of course, any substantial theoretical work toward an actual understanding of the sequece would also earn the bounty!",,"['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics', 'number-theory']"

61,Does an iterated exponential $z^{z^{z^{...}}}$ always have a finite period,Does an iterated exponential  always have a finite period,z^{z^{z^{...}}},"Let $z \in \mathbb{C}.$ Let $t = W(-\ln z)$ where $W$ is the Lambert W Function.  Define the sequence $a_n$ by $a_0 = z$ and $a_{n+1} = z^{a_n}$ for $n \geq 1$ , that is to say $a_n$ is the sequence $z, z^z, z^{z^z} ...$ This is sometimes called the iterated exponential with base $z$ . Here I am trying to prove (or disprove) $2$ things: For every $x \in \mathbb{R}$ there is $y^\star \in [0,\infty)$ such that for any $y \in \mathbb{R}$ with $|y| > y^\star$ the iterated exponential with base $z = x+ yi$ converges to a set of $3$ periodic accumulation points.  As $|y| \to \infty$ the $3$ points approach the orbit $\lbrace 0, 1, z \rbrace$ Let $E = (e^{1/e} , \infty) \cup \lbrace s \in \mathbb{C}:|t| = |W(-\ln s)| = 1 $ and $t^n \ne 1$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N} \rbrace$ If $z \in \mathbb{C} \setminus E$ , the iterated exponential is bounded and there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the iterated exponential converges to a set of $k$ periodic accumulation points. I have been studying Daniel Geisler's tetration map ; my first question is essentially a formalization of some observations I have made.  My second question has proven to be more problematic.  I have been experimenting numerically for several years, and I have observed that an iterated exponential sometimes gets ""slingshot"" to a neighborhood of $\infty$ .  When this happens it can be very difficult to tell what the next terms will be. The main thing I have tried in these situations is a kind of asymptotic analysis.  The next term $a_{n+1}$ is considered as the product $z^{\Re(a_n)}(z^i)^{\Im(a_n)}$ .  There are $36$ possibilities determined by the signs of $\Re(a_n), \Im(a_n)$ and whether $|z|, |z^i|$ are greater than, less than, or equal to $1$ .  Typically, though each factor is either $0, \infty,$ or else it just keeps going around the unit circle and doesn't approach any fixed value.  So there are really only $3$ possibilities: $0, \infty, 0\cdot\infty$ . If I'm ""lucky"" enough to get $a_{n+1} \sim 0$ , I can easily see that the ""slingshot to $\infty$ "" is followed by (approximately) $\lbrace 0, 1, z, z^z, \ldots \rbrace$ Otherwise I get stuck in limbo: it may be that the entire sequence is diverging to $\infty$ . However, I have never been able to find specific examples of this, other than $(e^{1/e} , \infty)$ .  If I get $a_{n+1}\sim \infty$ this basically puts me back at square one; I can ask the same question about $a_{n+2}$ , namely, is it $0, \infty$ , or something else.  So, in most (if not all) cases, I feel I have to explicitly calculate the next terms; otherwise I have no way of knowing if the whole sequence diverges to $\infty$ , or if some subsequent term is very close to $0$ . Another major problem is that the next term often is so big that it causes an overflow error on my calculator.  I have tried calculating the natural logs of the terms, using the iteration $b_0 = \ln z, b_{n+1} = e^{b_n}\ln z$ , but sometimes it doesn't help, because I still get overflow errors.  An example of this is $z = -2.5.$ After just 6 terms $a_n$ is on the order of $10^{26649}$ and $b_n$ has an almost identical value after 7 terms. Note : all of my work so far assumes the use of the principal branches of the natural log and the Lambert W function.","Let Let where is the Lambert W Function.

Given smooth periodic data $\{y_j\}$ , I would like to find an analytical approximation to the periodic array $\{x_j\}$ . My thoughts: In general, this seems hard, but despite the relatively complex nature of (1), surprisingly some simulations give me hope that something could be said about approximating an inverse formula, in specific cases and for large $L$ . For example, when $y_j=y$ , for all $j$ , as shown here , we have $$ y\simeq \frac12\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{x}}\hspace{2mm}\Leftrightarrow\hspace{2mm} x\simeq\frac{\pi}{4}y^{-2}\tag{2} $$ where, necessarily, $x=x_j$ for all $j$ . Interestingly enough, this simple approximation works reasonably well for non-constant and smooth $y_j\in[0,50]$ , as the following plots show Here, we first plotted an initial sequence $\{x_j\}$ of 400 points, given by $x_j=10^{-4}x e^{\sin x}$ , followed by its transformation via (1) and a second transformation on the obtained $y_j$ by (2), to recover an estimation for $x_j$ . Comparing the first and third plots suggests that a transformation simply given by (2), on data $\{y_j\}$ , could be enough to capture the unknown $\{x_j\}$ . Indeed, by overlapping the two sets, we have While we obtain a relatively similar function for $x_j$ , estimate (2) drastically fails when the scale of $y_j$ changes. For example, if we take $x_j$ corresponding to $5y_j$ , we get which produces not only a significantly worse estimate for $x_j$ , but also for $y_j$ , as seen in the second plot, compared to the previous one Nonetheless, I would anticipate that the scaling issue could be potentially fixed by amplifying the behavior of $x_j$ , perhaps through some transformation based on its second derivative (and/or a sigmoidal function of it?). I trust there could be a way to improve the estimate from equation (2) to be applied to large-scale $y_j$ , but I am struggling to understand the main mechanism through which that could be achieved. Any ideas? Edit 1 (some observations): Let $R(\{x_j\}) := y_j$ as defined in (1). A somewhat naive way of inverting (1) is to take $x_j=R(\{y_j\})$ or, more generally, $x_j=R(\{f(y_j)\})$ for some function $f$ . Interestingly, when $f(y)=y^2$ , $R(\{y_j^2\})$ becomes very similar to the approximation given by (2), as seen in the following plots Still far from the desired function but, despite being relatively surprising, I believe this is simply a consequence of the fact that, when $y_j$ is large, $R(\{y_j\})\simeq 1/y_j$ , but there might be room for further conclusions. Perhaps defining $f$ accordingly could give us a better inverse? Edit 2 (numerical approaches): While the analytical approach is the main question here, gradient descent and BFGS algorithms are being attempted here , which might hint at overall dynamics that could potentially motivate the theoretical exercise. Through gradient descent, a relatively fast estimate can be found here , for some sample data, but it yields non-negative values in $\{x_j\}$ . For example, gradient descent yields the following $\{x_j\}$ distribution convergence, where blue is the initial guess Ideally, I would like to guarantee $x_j>0, \forall j$ , but I would be more than happy if the transform seen here could be, at least locally, achieved, as the overall monotonicity seems preserved and it ""suggests"" some relatively simple rescaling mechanism.

When I first watched numberphile's 1+2+3+... = $\frac{-1}{12}$ I thought the sum actually equalled $\frac{-1}{12}$ without really understanding it. Recently I read some wolframalpha pages and watched some videos and now I understand (I think), that $\frac{-1}{12}$ is just an associative value to the sum of all natural numbers when you analytically continue the riemann-zeta function. 3Blue1Brown's video really helped. What I don't really understand is why it gives the value $\frac{-1}{12}$ specifically. The value $\frac{-1}{12}$ seems arbitrary to me and I don't see any connection to the sum of all natural numbers. Is there any intuition behind why you get $\frac{-1}{12}$ when analytically continue the zeta function at $\zeta(-1)$? EDIT (just to make my question a little clearer): I'll use an example here. Suppose you somehow didn't know about radians and never associated trig functions like sine to $\pi$ but you knew about maclaurin expansion. By plugging in x=$\pi$ to the series expansion of sine, you would get sine($\pi$) = 0. You might have understood the process in which you get the value 0, the maclaurin expansion, but you wouldn't really know the intuition behind this connection between $\pi$ and trig functions, namely the unit circle, which is essential in almost every branch of number theory. Back to this question, I understand the analytic continuation of the zeta function and its continued form for $s < 0$ $$\zeta(s)=2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\frac{\pi s}2\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s)$$ and how when you plug in s = -1, things simplify down to $\frac{-1}{12}$ but I don't see any connection between the fraction and the infinite sum. I'm sure there is a beautiful connection between them, like the one between trig functions and $\pi$, but couldn't find any useful resources on the internet.

99,Convergence of $\frac{\sqrt{a_{n}}}{n}$ [duplicate],Convergence of  [duplicate],\frac{\sqrt{a_{n}}}{n},"This question already has answers here : If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges, then so does $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {a_n}{n}$ (6 answers) Closed 3 years ago . Can anyone help me with the following question. If $a_{n} \geq 0$ and $\sum a_{n}$ converges then how to prove $\sum \frac{\sqrt{a_{n}}}{n}$ converges. Any idea where to start. My idea was to try using comparison test since $\sqrt{a_{n}} \leq a_{n}$ but it appears that it wouldn't work if $0 \leq a_{n} <1$.","This question already has answers here : If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges, then so does $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {a_n}{n}$ (6 answers) Closed 3 years ago .
