1,Count the number of n-bit strings with an even number of zeros.,Count the number of n-bit strings with an even number of zeros.,,"I am currently self-studying introductory combinatorics by reading Introduction to combinatorial mathematics. I am currently in the first chapter, and I have a question regarding one of the examples. The question was asking to count the number of n-bit strings with an even number of zeros. The answer is of course $2^{n-1}$. The author gave 2 solutions. I however didn't completely understand what I think is the straightforward one. The solution I got was that he took out 1 bit, leaving $(n-1)$ bits, if the number of zeros is even in the $(n-1)$-bit number, then he will just append a 1, if not then he will append a zero. So in the end we just needed to count the number of $(n-1)$-bit strings. The other solution (the straightforward one) that I didn't understand examined the symmetry that half of the $2^n$ must have an even number of zeros, and the other half will have an odd number of zeros. I just don't get why this property must hold. I can understand that half of the $2^n$ numbers will have even parity, but I can't see how it holds for the parity of the number of zero or one bits. If anyone can show me how that property holds, I'd be very grateful. I'd also be interested to see different explanations and proofs if possible. Thank you.","I am currently self-studying introductory combinatorics by reading Introduction to combinatorial mathematics.

51,Computing how many distinct digital products are below $10^n$,Computing how many distinct digital products are below,10^n,"Given a number $n$ , its digital product is the product of its digit. So the digital product of $15$ is $1\times 5=5$ , and the digital product of $760$ is $0$ , etc. I recently saw a nice video on Numberphile where they discussed persistence, namely how many iterations of digital product do you need in order to reach a single digit (e.g. $75\to 35\to 15\to 5$ has persistence of $3$ ). Playing a bit with the idea, it occurred to me that an efficient way of writing a code to check for this would include having a dictionary. This is because if I know that $35$ requires two steps, I don't need to iterate three steps from $75$ , I can just notice that it's one more than $35$ . Of course, you don't want to store this information for every number, because then you'd be wasting a lot of memory when testing this with very large numbers. So my first quest was to wonder what would be the maximal size of a dictionary we need. Well, If we test all the way to $10^n$ , the largest digital product would be $10^n-1$ , which is $9^n$ . This is great, since $\frac{9^n}{10^n}\to 0$ , so you're being relatively efficient. But in the real world, this is still a massive size of memory allocation on a personal computer. The next step, therefore, is to ask, how many distinct values can we get from a digital product ? I tested this up to $10^8$ , and the answer may surprise you. It turns out that there are only $2026$ values that you get from digital products below $10^8$ . About half of those are actually $0$ , since the longer the number the harder it is to avoid $0$ , but we are still talking about $43000000$ numbers whose product is non-zero. Here is a basic state of the results: $$\begin{array}{c|l} \text{Below} & \text{Distinct digital products}\\\hline 10^0 & 1\\ 10^1 & 10\\ 10^2 & 37\\ 10^3 & 101\\  10^4 & 226\\ 10^5 & 442\\ 10^6 & 785\\ 10^7 & 1297\\ 10^8 & 2026 \end{array}$$ This is quite a slow growth rate, and again, it makes sense. The longer your numbers are, the more likely they are to have $0$ inside, and if not a $0$ , then at least $1$ which can then be omitted and not change the value of the product. Obviously, the first question is whether or not there are only finitely many digital products. Of course not. $10^n-1$ has a digital product of $9^{n-1}$ , which would provide us with infinitely many distinct values. Is there a relatively straightforward to recursively compute how many distinct digital products are there below $10^n$ ? Or at least a reasonable upper bound? (Note that there is some intuition as to why this can be done recursively. For example, if $k$ has small digits ( $1$ to $4$ , then $10k+2$ has the same digital product as $2k$ , so if $2$ appears in a number of length $n$ , and all the digits are small, it does not add a new value. There are a lot of cases to test, and , which is why I hope someone more talented than me when it comes to finite combinatorics can see through them.)","Given a number , its digital product is the product of its digit. So the digital product of is , and the digital product of is , etc. I recently saw a nice video on Numberphile where they discussed persistence, namely how many iterations of digital product do you need in order to reach a single digit (e.g. has persistence of ). Playing a bit with the idea, it occurred to me that an efficient way of writing a code to check for this would include having a dictionary. This is because if I know that requires two steps, I don't need to iterate three steps from , I can just notice that it's one more than . Of course, you don't want to store this information for every number, because then you'd be wasting a lot of memory when testing this with very large numbers. So my first quest was to wonder what would be the maximal size of a dictionary we need. Well, If we test all the way to , the largest digital product would be , which is . This is great, since , so you're being relatively efficient. But in the real world, this is still a massive size of memory allocation on a personal computer. The next step, therefore, is to ask, how many distinct values can we get from a digital product ? I tested this up to , and the answer may surprise you. It turns out that there are only values that you get from digital products below . About half of those are actually , since the longer the number the harder it is to avoid , but we are still talking about numbers whose product is non-zero.

66,Colored areas in a triangle that don't share a line,Colored areas in a triangle that don't share a line,,"A friend and I came up with this puzzle and I'm looking for a proof. Given an equilateral triangle of area 1, color parts of the triangle red,   blue, and green such that Each color makes exactly one connected region strictly inside the triangle There is no line parallel to one of the sides that contains points of multiple colors Let $X$ be the minimum area of the red, blue, and green regions. Find   the maximum value of $X$ over all possible colorings. I suspect the maximum occurs in the following arrangement of teardrop-shaped figures, which each have an area of $\frac{4}{45}$ (new bound found by Daniel Mathias). This is an awfully strange number for what seems like a nice problem, so I'm not sure if it's correct. If you consider the triangle formed by the three points closest to the center and call $x$ the side length, $\frac{4}{45}$ can be reached when $x=\frac{4}{5\cdot 3^{3/4}}$ . If $s$ is the side length of the original triangle, each region has area $x\left(\frac{s}{3}-\frac{5x\sqrt{3}}{12}\right)$ . Maximizing this gives $\frac{4}{45}$ . Does anybody have an idea of a proof (or a counterexample) that this indeed gives the maximum? If it is valid, is there any intuition behind the value $\frac{4}{45}$ that makes it so special? Also, we can look at the discrete case of this puzzle on a triangular grid with $n$ vertices on each side where we color vertices three colors. Asymptotically, this should have the same behavior as the original problem. I couldn't see a very nice pattern with small values—does anybody have a solution to this modified problem? We tried to look for problems similar to this one; it seems like it should be well known! However, we couldn't find anything.

67,Why does this intuition for combinations with repetition fail?,Why does this intuition for combinations with repetition fail?,,"When you are learning the difference between combinations and permutations without repetition. The logic for each of them is: 1) Permutation without repetition: Selecting 4 objects from 10, gives $10*9*8*7$ choices. 2) Combinations without repetition: Selecting 4 objects from 10, gives $10*9*8*7/(4*3*2*1)$. Here you always divide by the number of times you can arrange 4 objects since each of those combinations are the same, order doesn't matter. 3) Permutations with repetition: selecting 4 objects from 10, is $10*10*10*10$ 4) Combinations with repetition Now trying to apply this to combinations with repetition, my reasoning is this. Its similar to how one goes from permutations to combinations in the case of no repetition. There are 10 objects to choose from and you want to select 4. Each selection doesn't diminish the number of choices you have since its replacable. So for each possible selection you have 10 choices, selecting 4 then gives $10^4 / 4!$ since you need to divide by the number of ways 4 objects can be arranged to not overcount. I know this is wrong, I've seen solutions to this using stars and bars. But my question is basically, for the case of no repetition, combinations can be treated as permutations only if you divide by the number of ways you can arrange your selection, and that makes intuitive sense to me. When it comes to repetitions, permutations make sense to me. Selecting k objects from n choices is just $n^k$. So why cant I use the same reasoning here and say that the number of combinations is $n^k / k!$?","When you are learning the difference between combinations and permutations without repetition.

70,How to count matrices with rows and columns with an odd number of ones?,How to count matrices with rows and columns with an odd number of ones?,,"I proved that $\displaystyle \left(\sum_{k\, \rm odd}\binom{m}{k}\right)^{n-1}=\left(\sum_{k\;{\rm odd}}\binom{n}{k}\right)^{m-1}$ by counting matrices of size $n\times m$ with entries in $\{0,1\}$ such that the sum of columns and rows is odd. One can show that this can only happen if $m,n$ share the same parity. What are other ways of counting such matrices? By Davids observation, this is just $2^{(m-1)\times (n-1)}$, which suggests a better counting argument might be produced. Maybe something in the lines of my argument, but completing the $n-1\times m-1$ matrix freely with $1$s and $0$s, and showing its final rows and column may be completed so that it is a solution. I'll think about it. Proof From $\sum_i a_{ij}=1\mod 2,\sum_j a_{ij}=1\mod 2$, we get $$\sum_i\sum_j a_{ij}=m\equiv n=\sum_j\sum_i a_{ij}\mod 2$$ so that $m,n$ have the same parity. It follows in particular that if a matrix with uneven columns and rows has all rows with an odd number of ones, there exists at least one column with an even number of $1$s. To prove the formula, we can produce an even number of ones in a bitstring of length $m$ in $\sum_{k\;\rm odd}\binom{m}{k}$ ways. Take the first $n-1$ rows and complete so that each has an odd number of ones. I claim the last row may be completed so that every column also has an odd number of ones. Since the matrix built so far is $n-1\times m$; the first observation says there is a column with an even number of ones, for $m,n-1$ have opposite parity. Put a $1$, to obtain an $n-1\times m-1$ matrix, call it $M$. If $M$ has all columns with an odd number of $1$s, we're done, else there is some column with an even number of $1$s. Insert a $1$ in the corresponding place in the $n$-th row. Then we obtain an $n-1\times m-2$ matrix $M'$ with an odd number of $1$ in the rows (because we deleted $2$ columns, and our original rows had an odd number of ones), so there must exist a column with an even number of $1$s, thus we insert another $1$. Continuing, we see the algorithm stops at an odd numbers of $1$ always, and the proof is complete. The argument is of course symmetric in $m$ and $n$, since the method provides with any matrix of your liking, so the equation follows.","I proved that $\displaystyle \left(\sum_{k\, \rm odd}\binom{m}{k}\right)^{n-1}=\left(\sum_{k\;{\rm odd}}\binom{n}{k}\right)^{m-1}$ by counting matrices of size $n\times m$ with entries in $\{0,1\}$ such that the sum of columns and rows is odd.

I have grouped the inputs together into different counts using a pattern I discovered about the inputs and came up with a triangle. I'm hoping someone can cast a bit of light on what is happening! When I turn the inputs into a binary string, I get these groupings that correspond to elements in the triangle. It seems that these groups grow a certain way, but I'm not a mathematician and so are not good and generalising patterns.

I have been puzzling over this for a while now and cant figure out how the sequence works. I have put it half the triangle up to n = 14 so the whole thing should look like: 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 ... etc... so notice that the numbers contained within the brackets add up to the right number for the triangle, for n = 4, (2 4) add to 6 and so on. I'm hoping that someone might know where this sequence comes from or how to generalize this solution so that I can calculate the numbers in the triangle for every n. Thanks!

96,Another coins weighing puzzle,Another coins weighing puzzle,,"In a bank safe deposit box 80 identical coins can be found, of which 2 or 3 are fake. Jason knows that there are 3 fake coins and has also identified them. He is challenged to prove it to his friends Christian and Mary, who both know that the fake coins are 2 or 3 and, in addition, know that each fake coins weigh 1 gram less than the genuine ones. Jason can use a balance scale to perform as many weighings as he likes, but without giving away the identity (fake/genuine) of any coin, at any stage in the process. Which are the optimum number of weighings that Jason must do so as to prove to his friends that the fake coins are exactly 3? No tricks are allowed :) To clarify, there is no limitation in the number of weighings; Jason can do as many as he wants (we are not necessarily looking for the minimum number). Below are my thoughts: Jason randomly picks 64 coins and weighs 32 against the other 32. We have the following cases: The scale balances, so we have either 0+0 (all are genuine) or 1+1. In this case, we again split them into two groups 16+16 and weight one against the other. If they balance, we are in the case of 0+0. Otherwise we have 1+1. So we know we have at least 2 fake coins. Then we need to prove that in the remaining 16 coins there is 1 more fake. The scale does not balance. We either have 0+1, or 0+2 or 0+3 or 1+2 (in any order). We take the lighter group and split them into 16+16. If the scale balances, we are in one of the first 3 cases. We then know that the second group contains from 1 to 3 fake. Then we take the 2nd group and split it into 16+16. Again we have the following cases: 1-0, 1+1, 2+0, 3+0, 1+2. If the scale balances, we know we have 1+1.  Then we need to prove that in the remaining 16 coins there is 1 more fake. If it does not, we take the heavier and split it into 8+8. If the scale balances, we know we have 0+0 fake so we are in one of the cases 1+0, 2+0 or 3+0. We then take the lighter (for which we know it contains 1 or 2 or 3 fake) and split it into 8+8. We again have 5 cases: 1-0, 1+1, 2+0, 3+0, 1+2. If the scale does not balance, we have 1+2 (so we know for sure we have >2 fake). We continue with the remaining cases and then do the same with the 16 coins. Will this work?
