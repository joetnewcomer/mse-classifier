The question I have is that, given the imaginary quadratic field $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$, I want to find; (1) all irreducible elements of it, (2) show that it is a Euclidean domain, and (3) show that for an odd prime number $p,\; \exists \;x,y\; \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $p = x^2+2y^2$ iff $p=1,3(\textrm{mod}\; 8)$. I have been reading and have books but there are some things I am not getting. (a) My attempt at finding the units (I read that there are only ${}^{\pm}1$ for this integral domain (ID)); A unit is an element with an inverse, so for an element $p_1 \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$, there is another element $p_1'$ s.t. $p_1\,p_1' = p_1'\,p_1 = 1$ (it is integral domain, not just domain). Let $p_1 := a+b\sqrt{-2}$ and $p_1':=x+y\sqrt{-2}$ and so $p_1\,p_1' = 1$ becomes $(a+b\sqrt{-2})(x+y\sqrt{-2}) = 1  = 1+0\sqrt{-2}$ and into the two equations, $1=ax-2by$ and $0=ay+bx$. Solving these leads to $x=\frac{a}{a^2+2b^2}$, $y=\frac{-b}{a^2+2b^2}$ and $p_1'=\frac{a}{a^2+2b^2} + \left( \frac{-b}{a^2+2b^2} \right)\sqrt{-2}$, which can only belong to $\mathbb{Z}$ if $b=0,\;a={}^{\pm}1$. Is there a better way of determing the units of an ID ? I read that the units, $\epsilon$, of a quadratic ID of the general form $R[\sqrt{d}]$, where $d$ was square-free, were determined by $Norm(\epsilon) = {}^{\pm}1$ Is this general ? Is this for any $d$ that is square-free (though I see little difference between $d=d$ and $d=z*d$, as $z\in \mathbb{Z}$) ? (1) I know, procedurally, how to do this for a given element, but I do not know of a better way to do it in general. Here is my attempt: I read that: An element $p$ of an ID is irreducible in R if it satisfies: (i) $p \neq 0$ and $p$ is not a unit, (ii) if $p=ab$ in R, then $a$ or $b$ is a unit in R. (maybe because I know the units in this ID I can say that all other non-zero elements are irreducible ? ) So if $p = ab$, with $a = m+n\sqrt{-2}$, then using the as-of-yet-unproved-homomorphism-norm-map, $N(ab) = N(a)\,N(b)$, $N(p=x+y\sqrt{-2}) = x^2+2y^2 = N(a)\,N(b) = (m^2+2n^2)\,N(b)$. Now if I had a specific element, to determine if it was irreducible, I could then determine what values of $N(a)$ and $N(b)$ were valid so that their product equaled $N(p) = N(x+y\sqrt{-2})$, which this latter term would be an integer ($N: \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}] \mapsto \mathbb{Z}$).

I am nearly certain that, for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , the answer to this question is no, and I suspect there is probably a solution to this using Dedekind's theorem or some similar tool.

To get the ball rolling, I have written up an elementary proof for the case $n=2$ below. Other proofs for specific values of $n$ are very welcome as well. Theorem: Let $f_1,\dots,f_k\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be polynomials of degree at most $2$ . Then there exists a prime $p$ such that each $f_i$ is either reducible or of degree $\leqslant 1$ , mod $p$ . Proof: Suppose that $f_i=a_ix^2+b_ix+c_i$ for each $i$ . By the quadratic formula, if $a_i$ does not vanish mod $p$ , then $f_i$ will have a root mod $p$ ( $p>2$ ) if and only if $b_i^2-4a_ic_i$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ . Thus let $\delta_i=b_i^2-4a_ic_i$ for each $i$ . It will suffice to find a prime $p$ such that $\delta_i$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ , for every $i$ . Let $p_1,\dots,p_l$ be all of the odd prime divisors of each $\delta_i$ , and consider the system of congruences \begin{align} p\equiv 1&\mod 4 \\ p\equiv 1&\mod p_1 \\ p\equiv 1&\mod p_2 \\ &\vdots \\ p\equiv 1&\mod p_l. \end{align} The collection $\{4,p_1,\dots,p_l\}$ is pairwise coprime by construction, so Sun Zi's theorem tells us that the above system of congruences is equivalent to $p\equiv m\text{ }(\operatorname{mod} 4p_1\dots p_l)$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$ . Now, $m$ is certainly coprime with $4p_1\dots p_l$ , since $m$ is congruent to $1$ mod $4$ and $1$ mod $p_i$ , for each $i$ . Thus, by Dirichlet's theorem , there exists some $\lambda\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $m+\lambda\cdot 4p_1\dots p_l$ is prime; let $p=m+\lambda\cdot 4p_1\dots p_l$ . By construction, $p$ is congruent to $1$ mod $4$ and $1$ mod $p_i$ , for each $i$ . In particular, $p$ is a quadratic residue mod $2$ and mod each $p_i$ , so, by quadratic reciprocity , $2$ and each $p_i$ are all quadratic residues mod $p$ . Similarly, since $p$ is equivalent to $1$ mod $4$ , we have that $-1$ is also a quadratic residue mod $p$ . By construction, every $\delta_i$ is plus-or-minus a product of powers of $\{2,p_1,\dots,p_l\}$ , and so – since products of quadratic residues are quadratic residues – every $\delta_i$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$ . This means that each $\overline f_i$ is either linear or reducible, mod $p$ , as desired.","In the comments section of this question , the original poster raised an interesting variation on the problem, which I will state as follows: Let .

For each natural number $n$, there is a ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together with a distinguished ring homomorphism $$\pi_n:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}.$$ For any given integer $k$, we can think of $\pi_n(k)$ as the remainder when $k$ is divided by $p^n$. Now clearly, $\pi_n$ will never be injective. If we wanted to get around this, we could trying bundling up all the $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together as a direct product. So define: $$\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z} = \prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$$ There is, of course, a unique ring homomorphism $\pi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}.$ In fact, it can be computed pointwise: $$(\pi(k))_{n} = \pi_n(k)$$ In some sense, we might say that $\pi(k)$ is the sequence of remainders obtained by attempting to divide $k$ by increasingly large powers of $p$.

Perhaps there are situations where we're working away in $\mathbb{Z}$ but we find that there aren't ""enough"" integers to do what we're trying to do; if so, one idea would be to look in $\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}$ for an appropriate choice of $p.$ Suppose $p$ is a prime number. Then to compute the number of copies of $p$ in the prime factorization of an integer $k$, we can simply count the number of $0$'s in the sequence $\pi(k)$. Furthermore, these $0$'s will always occur as an initial segment. Question. Is $\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}$ widely studied, is it associated with a standard name or notation, and where can I learn more about it?","Fix a positive integer $p$, possibly prime. For each natural number $n$, there is a ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together with a distinguished ring homomorphism $$\pi_n:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}.$$ For any given integer $k$, we can think of $\pi_n(k)$ as the remainder when $k$ is divided by $p^n$. Now clearly, $\pi_n$ will never be injective. If we wanted to get around this, we could trying bundling up all the $\mathbb{Z}/p^n \mathbb{Z}$ together as a direct product. So define: $$\mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z} = \prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$$ There is, of course, a unique ring homomorphism $\pi : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^\mathbb{N} \mathbb{Z}.$ In fact, it can be computed pointwise: $$(\pi(k))_{n} = \pi_n(k)$$ In some sense, we might say that $\pi(k)$ is the sequence of remainders obtained by attempting to divide $k$ by increasingly large powers of $p$. The cool thing about this is that: I'm pretty sure that $\pi$ is always injective; hence, we've included the integers in a bigger number system.

It's easy to see it attains it's maximum (0.5) on Fermat primes (those of form $2^n + 1$), and you can calculate a little bit to see what kind of primes correspond to some fractions, but that's not really interesting. Do we know is there a limit of that sequence? Does it get arbitrarily close to zero? Is there a way we can speak of mean value of that sequence?",,['number-theory']
