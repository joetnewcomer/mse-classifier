But shortly before this happens, more or less obvious and intricate patterns shortly show up, and I'd like to understand them. The numbers are arranged by these formulas with $\hat k = \frac{\sqrt{k}}{2}$ $$x_\alpha(k) = -\hat k\cos(\alpha\cdot 2 \pi\cdot \hat k)$$ $$y_\alpha(k) = -\hat k\sin(\alpha\cdot 2 \pi\cdot \hat k)$$ – the distance between consecutive numbers along the spiral being controlled by the parameter $\alpha$ .

(""For $\alpha=1$ there is a cross with a 8-fold   rotational symmetry, because ...."") Note that for $\alpha=1$ the square numbers are aligned along the horizontal axis: One final remark: The observed patterns come as a surprise (somehow) because ""from the distance"" the spiral looks almost like a set of concentric circles thus having seemingly total rotational symmetry. But in fact the spiral has no rotational symmetry at all (only for 360°). And the ever changing patterns are due to this fact: the concentric circles do show only patterns reflecting the density of numbers along them. In this example the density is $10$ per $2\pi$ . Note how the triangle numbers (compared to the square numbers in the case of the spiral) are arranged along the horizontal line. Let $\triangle(k) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ take the values $0,1,3,6,10,15,\dots$ We observe along the horizontal line $n(k) = 10\triangle(k) + 1$ (to the right) and $m(k) = n(k) + 5k$ (to the left): To see how the spiral patterns continue here for $\alpha = 4\sqrt{2}, 8, 8\sqrt{2}$ : There's a little Youtube video where you can see the number spiral continuously change for $\alpha$ going from 1 to 4.","Distributing the natural numbers as circles evenly along the Archimedean spiral yields surprising patterns when changing the radius of the circles: they cover more and more of the plane, finally covering it completely.

6,Connection/Consistency Between Different Definitions of Polyhedron? And How Does This Proof Apply to This Definition?,Connection/Consistency Between Different Definitions of Polyhedron? And How Does This Proof Apply to This Definition?,,"My textbook gives the following definition of a polyhedron: A polyhedron is defined as the solution set of a finite number of linear equalities and inequalities: $$\mathcal{P} = \{ x \mid a^T_j x \le b_j, \ j = 1, \dots , m, \ c_j^T x = d_j, \ j = 1, \dots , p \}$$ A polyhedron is thus the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces and hyperplanes.  Affine set (e.g., subspaces, hyperplanes, lines), rays, line segments, and halfspaces are all polyhedra. It is easily shown that polyhedra are convex set. I was trying to find a proof of the fact that polyhedra are convex sets, and so I came across this : Let $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}$ be a vector and let $b$ a scalar. Suppose that $\mathrm{\mathbf{x}}$ and $\mathrm{\mathbf{y}}$ satisfy $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}' \mathrm{\mathbf{x}} \ge b$ and $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}' \mathrm{\mathbf{y}} \ge b$ , respectively, and therefore belong to the same halfspace. Let $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ . Then, $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}'(\lambda \mathrm{\mathbf{x}} + (1 - \lambda)\mathrm{\mathbf{y}}) \ge \lambda b+ (1 - \lambda)b = b$ , which proves that $\lambda \mathrm{\mathbf{x}} +(1 - \lambda) \mathrm{\mathbf{y}}$ also belongs to the same halfspace. Therefore a halfspace is convex. Since a polyhedron is the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces, the result follows from part (a). The author provides a proof of this fact in his own question. However, after trying to understand this proof, a number of questions arose: The proof starts by supposing that $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}' \mathrm{\mathbf{x}} \ge b$ and $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}' \mathrm{\mathbf{y}} \ge b$ . But, in the above definition of a polyhedron, it is said that $\mathcal{P} = \{ x \mid a^T_j x \le b_j, \ j = 1, \dots , m, \ c_j^T x = d_j, \ j = 1, \dots , p \}$ ; in other words, we have that $a^T_j x \le b_j, \ j = 1, \dots , m$ , instead of $a^T_j x \ge b_j$ , which it seems is what the proof has? The above definition also has the set condition $c_j^T x = d_j, \ j = 1, \dots , p$ . Is this equivalent to $\mathrm{\mathbf{a}}'(\lambda \mathrm{\mathbf{x}} + (1 - \lambda)\mathrm{\mathbf{y}}) \ge \lambda b+ (1 - \lambda)b = b$ in the proof? The proof says that ""Since a polyhedron is the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces, ..."". What about the hyperplanes? I see no mention of them in the proof.

Any very clear and rigorous methods to prove this?","I'm trying to prove that if a point is outside a triangle, then there is a line through that point that does not intersect the triangle. This fact seems obvious, but I couldn't come up with a satisfying proof. I tried going by contradiction (that if any line intersects the triangle,then the point is surrounded by points contained on the triangle's sides, so the point is inside the triangle) but I do not find it satisfying, mainly because a line could intersect the triangle ""in the backside""(this would only be a problem if the point were to lie on one of the triangle's sides though), but it still doesn't feel rigorous enough. Another idea would be to consider parallels to the sides, but I couldn't finish this proof well enough. Any very clear and rigorous methods to prove this?",,['geometry']
27,Geometric intuition of composition of hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic trig functions,Geometric intuition of composition of hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic trig functions,,"We can evaluate $\cos(\arcsin x)$ with simple geometric intuition. Write $y = \cos(\arcsin x)$. Letting $\theta = \arcsin x$, $y = \cos \theta$ corresponds to a right triangle with angle $\theta$, adjacent side length $y$, and hypotenuse $1$. Pythagoras gives that the opposite side has length $\sqrt{1-y^2}$. Then $\sin \theta = \sqrt{1-y^2}/1 = \sqrt{1-y^2}$. Now $\sin \theta = \sin(\arcsin x) = x$ with appropriate bounds, so $x = \sqrt{1 - y^2}$ with appropriate bounds, so $y = \cos (\arcsin x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ with appropriate bounds. It can be shown that $\cosh (\mathrm{arcsinh} \ x) = \sqrt{1+x^2}$. Can we derive this using a similar intuitive geometric construction, perhaps on a hyperbola?

I tried using geometric probability, and I got a region that looks like what you would get if you put one vertex of a unit cube at the origin (and orient the edges such that they line up with the positive axes), and move the corner at the origin from (0,0,0) to (9,9,9) (is this region correct?). I calculated the volume by finding the area of the one of the faces of the cube (which is 1), and multiplying it by the distance it moved (which is 9). Since there are three of these squares, the volume is 27. I then add this to the volume of the cube, which results in 28. The total volume is 10^3 = 1000, so the probability is 28/1000 = 7/250.

Claim: Every triangulation of an $n$-sided polygon has $n-2$ triangles. Base Case ($n=3$): Trivial. We let $P$ be a polygon with $n$ edges.

Polygon $a$ has $k+1$ edges ($k$ edges of $P$ plus the diagonal), where $k$ is between $2$ and $n-2$. Then, polygon $b$ has $n-k+1$ edges ($n-k$ edges of $P$ plus the diagonal). If we apply the induction hypothesis to polygon $a$, then polygon $a$ can be broken up into $k-1$ triangles. Likewise, by applying the induction hypothesis to polygon $b$, polygon $b$ can be broken up into $n-k-1$ triangles. Putting polygons $a$ and $b$ together, we get $n-2$ triangles. $(k-1)+(n-k-1) = n-2$ triangles. I think my confusion arises when considering that we didn't use the induction hypothesis for $n+1$ sides. Instead, we used the induction hypothesis separately on two sub polygons of $P$. Here's the proof I'm referencing: https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~ungor/courses/fall08/polytri.pdf","I am having trouble understanding a certain proof. Claim: Every triangulation of an $n$-sided polygon has $n-2$ triangles. Base Case ($n=3$): Trivial. We let $P$ be a polygon with $n$ edges. A diagonal is drawn between two vertices of $P$, splitting $P$ up into two smaller polygons $a$ and $b$. Polygon $a$ has $k+1$ edges ($k$ edges of $P$ plus the diagonal), where $k$ is between $2$ and $n-2$. Then, polygon $b$ has $n-k+1$ edges ($n-k$ edges of $P$ plus the diagonal). If we apply the induction hypothesis to polygon $a$, then polygon $a$ can be broken up into $k-1$ triangles. Likewise, by applying the induction hypothesis to polygon $b$, polygon $b$ can be broken up into $n-k-1$ triangles.
