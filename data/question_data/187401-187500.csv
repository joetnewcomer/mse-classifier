0,What is tangent to a curve or function?,What is tangent to a curve or function?,,"When I read my textbooks or even type ""what is a tangent?"" on google, I have always got an answer similar to these lines: ""A straight line or plane that touches a curve or curved surface at a point, but if extended does not cross it at that point."" Now when I am thinking about graph of $\sin x$ or $\cos x$, it is very hard for me to believe this definition because if we draw a line touching any point on such curves then either it will cut at some point or touch at (infinitely) many points. So therefore it is very hard for me to believe this concept (or definitions). Please correct me if I am wrong at any point suggest a better definition in good mathematical framework.

A CDF $F(x):\mathbb{R} \mapsto [0,1]$ of some random variable is raised to the n-th power. The function is continuous all over its domain and has the typical characteristics of CDFs (monotonic ascending etc.). What happens when I consider the following? $$\lim_{n\to+\infty}F^n(x)$$ I plotted some stuff and as the power increases, I get an interesting situation. In some cases, it seems like the function tends to a dirac delta, but in other circumstances, I get different evidence. For example, using the Gaussian distribution I have the following: Looks like the function approaches to a delta. In the picture this is not evident sorry, but as $n$ increases, the function looks like converging to a vertical line on the right. If I use an exponent like $n=10000$ I get a diagram with a rect vertical line on the right. But if I use the exponential CDF: Here no matter the exponent, The curve seems translating to the right. So my question is are there conditions for which the following: $$\lim_{n\to+\infty}F^n(x) = \delta_t(x)$$ holds? Where $t$ is the delta translation coefficient.",,"['probability', 'limits', 'functions', 'probability-limit-theorems']"
