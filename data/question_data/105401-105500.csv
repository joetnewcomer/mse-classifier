2,Exchange of volume between spheres until they no longer intersect,Exchange of volume between spheres until they no longer intersect,,"Let's say we have two spheres (named $1$ & $2$) whose sizes are stored as radii ($r_1$ and $r_2$) with centres being $d$ distance apart. Now when the two spheres intersect (id est, $d < r_1 + r_2$) I want to 'drain' the volume of one sphere into the other precisely such that there is no intersect, yet no gap either (thus $d = r'_1 + r'_2$). The larger sphere will siphon from the smaller sphere. Let $1$ be larger; $v_1 > v_2$. My thought coming into this was that it would be simple, I'm just making one smaller, and one larger, but the larger one would have grown 'slower' because of it already being larger (probably due to the relationship between volume and radius, $v = \frac{4\pi r^3}{3}$). But I'm having trouble deducing the volume, $\Delta v$, that would be needed to shift between the spheres (which won't move during the instantaneous exchange) to influence the radii correctly. Given that the volume is 'traded' between the two ($v'_1 = v_1 + \Delta v$, $v'_2 = v_2 - \Delta v$), the sum volume of the two spheres will be conserved ($v_1 + v_2 = v'_1 + v'_2$). I'm writing the program such that the mathematical expression won't need to be robust enough to accept a lot of corner cases, so we can assume some things (like the centre of the smaller sphere will not be inside the larger sphere's bounds) if it helps. One of the things we tried (when we couldn't solve the cube-root-containing simultaneous equations we came up with) was finding the volume of the intersection , and just using that as $\Delta v$ (the resultant spheres still had radii that overlapped).","Let's say we have two spheres (named $1$ & $2$) whose sizes are stored as radii ($r_1$ and $r_2$) with centres being $d$ distance apart.

24,Question about proof regarding a triangle and a line.,Question about proof regarding a triangle and a line.,,"RFC: I am wondering if my reasoning below works. Prove: In a plane, if a line intersects a triangle at a point not a vertex, then it must intersect at least one other side of the triangle. Let us assume a line intersecting one side of a triangle does not intersect any other side of the triangle. Let there be a (triangle)ABC and a line L that intersects the triangle at point P. Let P be between (segment)AB. The points A and B separate a plane into two half planes H1 and H2. From the definition of a triangle, one point is non-collinear with the other two points that make the triangle. Thus, point C will lie in either H1 or H2. Since A-P-B (P is between A and B) with P on L, there is at least one point of L in the interior of (triangle)ABC. From the definition of a triangle, the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the length of its sides. Since a perimeter can not be infinite it must be finite and subsequently the length of the sides must be finite. A line has no finite length by definition as that would be a segment. Therefore line L may have a segment from point P longer than the sum of the legs of the triangle. Placing this segment on the same half plane as point C of the triangle, the endpoint opposite P will not lie in the interior of the triangle ABC. With one side of the segment lying in the interior of triangle ABC and the other outside the interior we contradict our assertion that the line L does not intersect another leg of the triangle ABC.

The derivation begins like this: We define a hyperbola as the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the plane such that the absolute value of the difference  of the distances between the foci and $(x, y)$ is a fixed value $d$. Consider a hyperbola centered at the origin, whose foci lie on the $x$-axis at $(c,0)$ and $(-c,0)$, with $c>0$. The vertices fall at $(a,0)$ and $(-a,0)$, with $a>0$. The assumption that $a<c$ is reflected in the diagram (below), and is used explicitly later on. Since we're building from the definition, rather than observing hyperbolas ""in the wild"", I'd like to know how we know this is in fact the case. I tried to prove it explicitly by considering the case where $a>c$, but didn't have much success: Because $a>c>0$, $A$ is closer to $C_2$ than it is to $C_1$. So $\left| \overline{C_1A}\right| > \left| \overline{C_2A}\right|$, which means $\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|>0$. Therefore, $\left|\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|\right|=\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|$. Making use of the definition, we see that $\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|=d$. We can calculate the above difference in distances in terms of $a$ and $c$, remembering that $a>c$ (and $a>-c$). $$(a-(-c))-(a-c)=d\\ (a+c)-(a-c)=d\\ 2c=d$$ I don't know if that's of any use, though I think it would suggest there's only one hyperbola for any two particular foci, which is certainly not true (though I wouldn't want to have to prove it). I haven't figured anything out for the case where $a=c$, but I supect my time would be better spent asking for clarification than to continue trying to push forward my own. Any help? Slight update: I see now (thanks for the help coffeemath!) that if $a>c$, then the difference in distances equals the gap between the two foci, $2c$, and that's true for every value of $a$ along the $x$-axis. So if we wanted to construct such a hyperbola using the above definition, we'd have to use $2c$ for our fixed value $d$. Though I still can't nail it down analytically, it looks like the closest you could get would the limit as $a\to c^-$. I played around with some graphs to see what happens as $a\to c^-$, and it's cool to see the hyperbola actually approach rays along the $x$-axis. I graphed a series of hyperbolas to see this: $\left(\frac{x^2}{.5}-\frac{y^2}{.5}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.75}-\frac{y^2}{.25}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.9}-\frac{y^2}{.1}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.99}-\frac{y^2}{.01}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.999}-\frac{y^2}{.001}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.9999}-\frac{y^2}{.0001}=1\right)$.

Now, given those and taking the known angle of 60 o , we substitute the director numbers of $2x-2y+z+6-0:[A'=2,B'=-2,C'=1]$ and the angle in the last formula, giving us: $$\cos{60^\circ} = \pm \frac{A(2)-B(-2)+C(1)}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2} \sqrt{(2)^2+(-2)^2+(1)^2}}$$ Simplifying, we get(positive because $\theta$ is acute): $$\frac{1}{2}=\frac{2A-2B+C}{3 \sqrt{A^2+B^2+C^2}}$$ Another simplification finally for: $$3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$$ Now, we have 3 equations: $A-C+D=0$ $2A+2C+D=0$ $3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$ If we take 1) and 2) and write them as $D(A,C)$ we get: $D=C-A$ $D=-2A-2C$ From which we can obtain A in terms of C $$-2A-2C=C-A$$ $$A=-3C$$ Now we substitute back in 1): $$(-3C)-C+D=0$$ $$C=\frac{1}{4}D$$ Since I want every director number in terms of D we substitute again but in A since A was in function of C. $$A=-3C$$ $$A=-3(\frac{1}{4}D)$$ $$A=\frac{-3}{4}D$$ Now, we have found $A(D)$, $C(D)$ we have yet to find $B(D)$ I'll explain why I think and want everything in terms of D, if we take the general form of a planes equation $Ax+By+Cz+D=0$ and substitute $A$ and $C$ with our known values we get: $$(\frac{-3}{4}D)x+By+(\frac{1}{4}D)z+D=0$$ if we divide by $D \neq 0$ and then multiply by 4 to eliminate fractions: $$\frac{-3}{4}x+\frac{B}{D}y+\frac{1}{4}z+1=0$$ $$-3x+\frac{4B}{D}y+z+4=0$$ From here it's clear that if we find B in terms of D and B is linear we have the planes equation, so, in 3) $3(A^2+B^2+C^2)=(4A-4B+2C)^2$ we substitute A and C: $$3((\frac{-3}{4}D)^2+B^2+(\frac{1}{4}D)^2)=(4(\frac{-3}{4})-4B+2(\frac{1}{4}D))^2$$ $$\vdots$$ $$104B^2+80DB+35D^2=0$$ Here is were I get stuck, I get imaginary parts, since I have to use the quadratic formula, so any help is really appreciated, the problem states that there are two solutions, but this is what I have thought of if anyone can supply any solution I'll be very grateful.

94,Modeling Nanotubes Geometry,Modeling Nanotubes Geometry,,"In various references, we see the construction of unit cells of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from chiral and translational vectors. The chiral vector is given as: $$\vec C_h = n\vec a_1 + m\vec a_2$$ While the translational vector is given by: $$\vec T = t_1\vec a_1 + t_2\vec a_2$$ Clearly, $\vec C_h$ and $\vec T$ must be orthogonal, hence $\vec C_h \cdot \vec T = 0$ . In the literature, it always appears that $t_1 = \displaystyle\frac{2m+n}{d_R}$ and $t_2 = -\displaystyle\frac{2n+m}{d_R}$ , where $d_R=\mathrm{gcd}(2m+n,2n+m)$ . My questions are, how to deduce this? And how does this relate to the fact that the translational vector can determine the size of the unit cell? I managed to replicate this idea for a hexagonal lattice, similar to graphene.

95,Angle between tangential line and centerline of eccentrically spinning circles,Angle between tangential line and centerline of eccentrically spinning circles,,"Pictured in Figure 1, there are two equally sized, eccentrically mounted circles with radius r=25 , turning around centerpoints with distance a=100 with eccentricity e=10 .

The circles spin around their centers with a phase difference of 180°, meaning the lines connecting the circles' centers to the centers of rotation are always parallel, but point in opposite directions. There are (objectively poorly drawn) angles α and β , with α being the angle between the horizontal and tangential line. I'm now trying to find an equation for α as a function of β .

98,Can such a pair of functions exist?,Can such a pair of functions exist?,,"Let $p\colon \mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ and $q\colon \mathbb{Z}^n\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ , such that: $\forall x,y,z\in \mathbb{Z^n}\colon q(x, p(y)) \leq q(x, p(z)) \iff d(x,y) \leq d(x,z)$ $\forall x\in \mathbb{Z^n}\colon q(x,\cdot)$ is monotone, where $d$ denotes the Euclidean distance. Can such $p$ and $q$ exist? It's clear that $p$ cannot be something as simple as $\|x\|_2$ , since for example in case of $n=2$ both $\|(1,0)\|_2 = \|(-1, 0)\| = 1$ , but if $x = (2,0)$ then $(-1,0)$ is twice as far from it as $(1,0)$ . This makes me think, that $p$ somehow must encode the position in an invertible way. An idea I had is that for a fixed $x\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ we could define $p$ using the following: Since all the points are grid points, we could cover them with a countable number of circles (spheres). The sequence of radii is the square root of the integers that are expressable as the sum of $n$ squares. For $n\geq 4$ , all the natural numbers form the sequence of radii, due to Lagrange's four-square theorem. The complicated part is the number of lattice points on these spheres, this is related to the sum of squares function . But it's easy to see, that from the perspective of an $x\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ if we order the points first by the index of the sphere and then by the index on the sphere (which for $n>2$ can be also tricky) then the $$C_{1,1}, C_{1,2}, C_{1,3}, C_{1,4}, C_{2,1}, C_{2,2}, C_{2,3}, C_{2,4}, C_{3,1}, C_{3,2} \dots$$ sequence can define $p(y)$ as we need. For every point $y$ assign its index in this ""C-sequence"" as $p(y)$ . So for example $p(C_{1,1}) = p((0,1)) = 1$ , $p(C_{2,2}) = p((-1,-1)) = 6$ , etc. The problem is that this whole construct is for a fixed $x$ as we use it as the center of the spheres. Let for $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}^n: c_x(y)$ denote the index of $y$ in this ""C-sequence"" if the center is $x$ (instead of $\underline{0}$ as in the example). It's easy to see that these $c_x$ functions are invertible. Let's define $p$ as $p(x) = c_{\underline{0}}(x)$ . Since they are invertible, we can define $q$ as a function that transforms the ""C-sequence"" from the perspective of $\underline{0}$ to the perspective of $x$ : $$q(x, p_y) = c_x(c_{\underline{0}}^{-1}(p_y))$$ Due to this strongly hacky definition it's true that if $p_y = p(y)$ , $p_z = p(z)$ and $q(x,p_y) \leq q(x,p_z)$ then $d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)$ since $q(x,p_y) = c_x(c_{\underline{0}}^{-1}(p_y)) = c_x(y)$ is the order of $y$ in the ""C-sequence"" from the perspective of $x$ , which is equivalent to the distance of $y$ from $x$ . So this satisfies my first condition. There is only one problem left, $q(x,\cdot)$ is clearly not monotone. It's easy to craft a counter-example for $n=2$ . Since $q(x,\cdot)$ is essentially the transformation taking $c_0$ into $c_x$ , it's enough the find points $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $c_{\underline{0}}(a)\leq c_{\underline{0}}(b)\leq c_{\underline{0}}(c)$ but neither $c_x(a) \leq c_x(b) \leq c_x(c)$ nor $c_x(a) \geq c_x(b) \geq c_x(c)$ holds. The following is a counter-example: $$c_{(0,0)}((0,1)) = 1 \leq c_{(0,0)}((1,0)) = 2 \leq c_{(0,0)}((1,2)) = 13$$ but $$c_{(2,1)}((0,1)) = 12 \geq c_{(2,1)}((1,0)) = 3 \leq c_{(2,1)}((1,2)) = 8$$ This was a kind of ""intuitive"" way of defining $p$ and $q$ but it didn't work out, so I'm wondering if it's really possible. It actually feels a little unnatural to have such functions, so maybe I should focus on proving their non-existence.","Let and , such that: is monotone, where denotes the Euclidean distance.
