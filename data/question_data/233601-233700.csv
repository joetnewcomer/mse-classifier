0,Proving these sets are well-ordered with the order inherited from $\mathbb{R}$.,Proving these sets are well-ordered with the order inherited from .,\mathbb{R},"These questions arise in my Set Theory module but I don't understand how to go about deciding if the following sets, with order inherited from the reals, are well-ordered or not. $\textbf{I would only like a hint or some intuition to help me along.}$ $A=\{\frac{1}{m}- \frac{1}{n} : n,m \in\mathbb{N}\}$ $B=\{-2^{-m}-3^{-n} : n,m \in\mathbb{N}\}$ I argue that $A$ is not well-ordered.  The generic element of $A$ , $\frac{1}{m}- \frac{1}{n}$ for some $n,m \in\mathbb{N}$ . We obtain that $-1 < \frac{1}{m}- \frac{1}{n} < 1$ . In particular, since the value of this element will ""converge"" to -1 as m tends to infinity, we cannot pick a smallest element of this set. Hence we cannot pick a smallest element for every subset of it, and so it cannot be well-ordered. For $B$ , I am stuck: The whole set has a least element. However this does not tell us about the least element of any subset of it, so this does not help us. We could check if there is an infinite strictly decreasing sequence in this set. I tried taking the subsequence of the even or odd terms in this, but this leads to increasing sequences. I need some help with this one.

Let be $(X,\le)$ a totally ordered set and we prove by induction that any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ has a minimum element. Since $X$ is a totally ordered set, previously we observe that any its subset $Y$ (finite or infinite) is a chain. Obviously any subset $A$ of one element $a$ has trivially a minimum. So we suppose that any subset of $n$ elements has a minimum element and then  we consider a subset $A$ of $n+1$ elements: since $A$ is finite there exists a bijection $\phi$ from $A$ onto some natural number $m$ , that is the successor of $n$ , and so we can organize the elements of $A$ in a finite succession, that is $A=\{a_1,...,a_{n+1}\}$ . Now we consider the subset $B=\{a_h\in A:h\le n\}$ : obviously $X$ is a subset of $A$ that has $n$ element and so it has a minimum element $b$ ; so since $A=B\cup\{a_{n+1}\}$ and since $A$ is a chain (remember what before we observed), it must be or $a_{n+1}\le b$ or $b<a_{n+1}$ and so for the transitivity property of the order relation $\le$ in any case $A$ has a minimum element. So now we only have to prove that any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ has a maximum element. So we consider the inverse relation $\preccurlyeq$ defined as $x\preccurlyeq y\iff y\le x$ for any $x,y\in X$ : clearly $\preccurlyeq$ is a total order, since indeed $\le$ is a total order, and any minimum in $\preccurlyeq$ is a maximum in $\le$ and so since any not empty finite subset $A$ has a minimum in $\preccurlyeq$ it follows that any not empty finite subset in $\le$ has a maximum element.

Then the Cartesian product is finite and it holds $$ \vert A \times B\vert = \vert A \vert \cdot \vert B \vert .$$ My proof: As $A$ und $B$ are finite we have two bijections $f: A \to [m]$ and $g:B\to [n]$ , where $[m], [n]$ are the intervalls $[1, ..., m]$ and $[1, ..., n]$ in $\mathbb{N}$ , respectively. I define the following function $h: A\times B \to [m\cdot n]$ , $$h(a,b) = f(a)+(g(b)-1)m$$ The function $h$ is injective because it's simply a composition of injective functions (note that $m>0$ ). Let $y \in [m\cdot n]$ then there exists a $k \in [n]$ such that $(k-1)m < y \leq km$ . Also, $y-(k-1)m \in [m]$ . So there exist two elements $a \in A $ with $f(a) = y-(k-1)m$ and $b \in B$ with $g(b) = k$ . Pluggin them into $h$ yields: $h(a,b) = f(a)+(g(b)-1)m=y-(k-1)m+m(k-1)=y$ . As $y$ was arbitrarily chosen, every element of $[m\cdot n]$ has a preimage. Hence, $h$ is bijective so that $A \times B$ is finite and has a cardinality of $\vert A \times B\vert =mn=\vert A \vert \cdot \vert B \vert$ . Is this correct?

I believe I've proved it, but I would prefer to simply cite it since the proof is unrelated to the rest of the paper and distracts from the main focus of the section.  I can find a lot of references to the fact that an infinite product of well-orderings is not necessarily a well-ordering, but finding this fact seems more difficult. As a secondary matter, here's my proof: Suppose $$\mathcal{S}:=\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} (s_1^\alpha, s_2^\alpha,\ldots)$$ is any nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ , with $(t_1,t_2,\ldots)$ an upper bound of $\mathcal{S}$ .  Note that $(t_1+1,0,\ldots)$ is also an upper bound of $\mathcal{S}$ . Thus the set $\mathcal{T}_1$ of upper bounds of $\mathcal{S}$ that are zero after the first coordinate is nonempty. Similarly we define $\mathcal{T}_k$ to be the set of upper bounds of $\mathcal{S}$ that are zero after the $k$ th coordinate.  As $\mathcal{T}_k\supseteq \mathcal{T}_j$ whenever $k>j$ , we then have $\mathcal{T}_k\not = \varnothing$ for all $k\geq 1$ . Beginning with any element of $\mathcal{T}_k$ , there are only finitely many elements in $\mathcal{T}_k$ lexicographically below it.  Thus each $\mathcal{T}_k$ has a minimal element $(t_1^k, t_2^k, \ldots)$ . Note that $(t_1^k,t_2^k,\ldots)$ is identical to $(t_1^{k+1},t_2^{k+1},\ldots)$ in the first $k-1$ coordinates, since $(t_1^{k+1},t_2^{k+1},\ldots, t_k^{k+1}+1,0,\ldots)$ is an element of $\mathcal{T}_k$ , which can't be lower than $(t_1^k,t_2^k,\ldots)$ .  Similarly $(t_1^k,t_2^k,\ldots)$ is also an element of $\mathcal{T}_{k+1}$ and so can't be lower than $(t_1^{k+1},t_2^{k+1},\ldots)$ .  So let $r_j:=t_j^{j+1}$ be the eventual value in the $j$ th coordinate. We will now show $(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ is the least upper bound for $\mathcal{S}$ . If $(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ was not an upper bound for $\mathcal{S}$ , then there is $\alpha\in A$ with $(s_1^\alpha,s_2^\alpha,\ldots) > (r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ .  Suppose $m$ is the first index at which $s_m^\alpha\not = r_m$ , in which case $s_m^\alpha>r_m$ by definition of lexicographic order.  But then $$(s_1^\alpha,s_2^\alpha,\ldots)> (r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_m,t_{m+1}^{m+1},0,\ldots) = (t_1^{m+1},t_2^{m+1},\ldots),$$ contradicting that the latter was an upper bound for $\mathcal{S}$ .  So $(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ is an upper bound for $\mathcal{S}$ . On the other hand, if there were $(q_1,q_2,\ldots) <(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ with $(q_1,q_2,\ldots)$ also an upper bound for $\mathcal{S}$ , then let $m$ again be the first index where $(q_1,q_2,\ldots)$ and $(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ differ, so that $q_m<r_m$ .  Then $(q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_m,q_{m+1}+1,0,\ldots)\in \mathcal{T}_{m+1}$ , which means we would have chosen $r_m \leq q_m$ .  So $(r_1,r_2,\ldots)$ is the supremum of $\mathcal{S}$ .  As $\mathcal{S}\not = \varnothing$ was arbitrary, the lexicographic ordering on $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ has the least upper bound property.","I need to use this statement in a paper.

Well, my previous post lead to some discussion about ambiguously worded probability problems. That specific question could be interpreted at least a few linguistically natural ways, and the conclusion was that we should avoid posing such questions that are ambiguous. Anyway, I've been thinking about the ambiguity of such questions. In the case of the question above, the author gave the answer of the probability being $1/3$ , which aligns with a natural interpretation of the question: the two coins land, we cannot see them, we only know that one of them is heads. That eliminates $TT$ from our remaining possible event set, and $HH$ is $1$ of the three events remaining. I have no disagreement about that. But, rereading the section today I came to what I hope is a legitimate realization: every event is the elements that satisfy that event connected with OR statements, i.e. the union of those elements . Consider the above question posed slightly differently: we imagine the same scenario (and interpretation) but now we wonder what is probability of getting a heads and a tails? This question can be more precisely (and boringly) posed as: what is the probability that $HT$ OR $TH$ occurs given that there is one $H$ in the event ? Here, it's clear the answer is 2/3. Notice that the only challenging part of this question was the line ""...what is probability of getting a heads and a tails?"" . This has to (1) be translated in our minds to an appropriate subset (event) of the sample space, and at the same time we have to account for the $HT \neq TH$ relative to our sample space but that $HT$ = $TH$ , relative to the event . We consider $HT$ and $TH$ unique in the sample space but the same for the event. Sorry if that seemed superfluous. What I'm asking is: am I correct to view an event as the elements that comprise it—their union? Second, I'm curious on the notation at the top, and third, I'm curious to any methods of thinking you might have on these (or more general) probability questions that are useful in avoiding confusion.

And if it is true, Is my proof is correct? And another thing, I am not fully able to intuitively comprehend why (4) implies (3) , I.e. Why if for some predicate $P(n)$ it is true that $\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$, Then it must be the case that $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ ? In words it means that, If we know that for any infinite subset of the natural numbers we take, There exists an element in the subset for which $P(n)$ is satisfied, Then it must be the case that there is some $N$ from which all of the $n$’s that are greater than this $N$ will satisfy $P(n)$ ? Let $P:\mathbb{N}\to\{True,False\}$ be some predicate, Prove that the following two statements are logically equivalent: (1) $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ (2) $\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, P(n)$ And use this logical equivalence to prove that the following two statements are logically equivalent too: (3) $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ (4) $\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$ Note: $\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$ denotes the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that have cardinallty of $\aleph_0$, I.e. $\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}):=\{A\in\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})| |A|=\aleph_0\}$. Proof that (1) implies (2) : Let’s define $A:=\{n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n)\}$, It is clear that $A\in\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and that $\forall n\in A, P(n)$, Therefore it is just left for us to show that $|A|=\aleph_0$ to accomplish the proof: Suppose by contradiction that $|A|\neq \aleph_0$, Then we get that it must be the case that $A$ is finite, And thus $|A|\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, Now there are two cases: $|A|\in\{0\}$ or $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$ If $|A|\in\{0\}$, We conclude that $|A|=0$, And thus $A=\emptyset$, Now because of (1) , We get that in particular for $N:=1$ we have $\exists N\lt n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$, And thus $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is natural number for which the statement $P(n)$ is satisfied, And we conclude by the way we defined the set $A$ that $n\in A$ which contradicts the fact that $A=\emptyset$. If $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$, Then $A$ is a non-empty finite set of natural numbers, And thus its maximum $\max(A)$ exists and is an element in $A$, Now let’s define $N:=\max(A)$, Then we get that $N\in A$, And thus $N\in \mathbb{N}$, And we can conclude by (1) that $\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N},P(n)$, And thus by the way we defined the set $A$, We conclude that $n\in A$, Which implies that it must be the case that $n\leq \max(A)$, But since $N=\max(A)$, We conclude that $n\leq N$, But this contradicts the fact that $N<n$. Thus we see that wether $|A|\in\{0\}$ or $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$, We always reach a contradiction, And thus it must be the case that $|A|=\aleph_0$, And we conclude that $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$ as was to be shown. Proof that (2) implies (1) : Suppose by contradiction that it is not true that $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$, I.e. suppose that (#) $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot P(n)$, We’ll show that (##) $\forall n\in A, n\leq N$: Suppose by contradiction that $\exists n\in A, n>N$, Then since $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ (Because  $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$), We conclude that $N<n\in\mathbb{N}$, And thus by (#) we conclude that $\lnot P(n)$, I.e. $P(n)$ is not satisfied, Also, Since $n\in A$, We get by (2) that it is also the case that $P(n)$ is satisfied, Therefore we got that $P(n)$ is not satisfied and $P(n)$ is satisfied at the same time, And thus we’ve reached a contradiction and it must be the case that $\forall n\in A, n\leq N$ as was to be shown. Now let’s define $B:=\{i\in\mathbb{N}|i\leq N\}$, We’ll show that $A\subseteq B$: Let $n\in A$, Then by the fact that $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, We get that $n\in\mathbb{N}$, Also by (##) we get that $n\leq N$, And thus we can conclude that $n\in B$ as was to be shown. Now since $|B|=N\in\mathbb{N}$, We conclude that $B$ is finite, And since $A\subseteq B$, We conclude that it must be the case that $A$ is also finite, But this contradicts the fact that $|A|=\aleph_0$ (as  $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$)) and we’ve reached a contradiction. Therefore it must be the case that $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ as was to be shown. Proof that (3) and (4) are logically equivalent: Let’s define a new predicate $Q(n)\equiv \lnot P(n)$, Then by what we’ve just shown, We conclude that: $$\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)$$ But this implies that: $$\lnot\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv\lnot\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)$$ Now since: $$\lnot\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv \\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot\lnot P(n)\equiv\\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$$ And since: $$\lnot\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, \lnot Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv \forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A,\lnot\lnot P(n)\equiv\\\equiv \forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$$ We conclude that: $$\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)\equiv\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$$ as was to be shown. Note: One example of using this proposition is in the context of limits of sequence: Let $\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be some sequence of real numbers, Inorder to show that $\lim_\limits{n\to\infty}a_n\neq L$, We have to show that $\exists\epsilon\in (0,\infty),\forall N\in\mathbb{N}, \exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, a_n\notin (L-\epsilon, L+\epsilon)$ (Here $P(n)\equiv a_n\notin (L-\epsilon,L+\epsilon)$) By the proposition we get that this is equivalent to show that: $\exists\epsilon\in (0,\infty),\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, a_n\notin (L-\epsilon,L+\epsilon)$ I.e. It is enough to show that $a_n\notin (L-\epsilon,L+\epsilon)$ for an infinite number of $n$’s.

And if it is true, Is my proof is correct? And another thing, I am not fully able to intuitively comprehend why (4) implies (3) , I.e. Why if for some predicate $P(n)$ it is true that $\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$, Then it must be the case that $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ ? In words it means that, If we know that for any infinite subset of the natural numbers we take, There exists an element in the subset for which $P(n)$ is satisfied, Then it must be the case that there is some $N$ from which all of the $n$’s that are greater than this $N$ will satisfy $P(n)$ ? Let $P:\mathbb{N}\to\{True,False\}$ be some predicate, Prove that the following two statements are logically equivalent: (1) $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ (2) $\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, P(n)$ And use this logical equivalence to prove that the following two statements are logically equivalent too: (3) $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ (4) $\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$ Note: $\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$ denotes the set of all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ that have cardinallty of $\aleph_0$, I.e. $\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}):=\{A\in\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})| |A|=\aleph_0\}$. Proof that (1) implies (2) : Let’s define $A:=\{n\in\mathbb{N}|P(n)\}$, It is clear that $A\in\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N})$ and that $\forall n\in A, P(n)$, Therefore it is just left for us to show that $|A|=\aleph_0$ to accomplish the proof: Suppose by contradiction that $|A|\neq \aleph_0$, Then we get that it must be the case that $A$ is finite, And thus $|A|\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, Now there are two cases: $|A|\in\{0\}$ or $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$ If $|A|\in\{0\}$, We conclude that $|A|=0$, And thus $A=\emptyset$, Now because of (1) , We get that in particular for $N:=1$ we have $\exists N\lt n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$, And thus $n\in\mathbb{N}$ is natural number for which the statement $P(n)$ is satisfied, And we conclude by the way we defined the set $A$ that $n\in A$ which contradicts the fact that $A=\emptyset$. If $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$, Then $A$ is a non-empty finite set of natural numbers, And thus its maximum $\max(A)$ exists and is an element in $A$, Now let’s define $N:=\max(A)$, Then we get that $N\in A$, And thus $N\in \mathbb{N}$, And we can conclude by (1) that $\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N},P(n)$, And thus by the way we defined the set $A$, We conclude that $n\in A$, Which implies that it must be the case that $n\leq \max(A)$, But since $N=\max(A)$, We conclude that $n\leq N$, But this contradicts the fact that $N<n$. Thus we see that wether $|A|\in\{0\}$ or $|A|\in\mathbb{N}$, We always reach a contradiction, And thus it must be the case that $|A|=\aleph_0$, And we conclude that $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$ as was to be shown. Proof that (2) implies (1) : Suppose by contradiction that it is not true that $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$, I.e. suppose that (#) $\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot P(n)$, We’ll show that (##) $\forall n\in A, n\leq N$: Suppose by contradiction that $\exists n\in A, n>N$, Then since $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ (Because  $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$), We conclude that $N<n\in\mathbb{N}$, And thus by (#) we conclude that $\lnot P(n)$, I.e. $P(n)$ is not satisfied, Also, Since $n\in A$, We get by (2) that it is also the case that $P(n)$ is satisfied, Therefore we got that $P(n)$ is not satisfied and $P(n)$ is satisfied at the same time, And thus we’ve reached a contradiction and it must be the case that $\forall n\in A, n\leq N$ as was to be shown. Now let’s define $B:=\{i\in\mathbb{N}|i\leq N\}$, We’ll show that $A\subseteq B$: Let $n\in A$, Then by the fact that $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, We get that $n\in\mathbb{N}$, Also by (##) we get that $n\leq N$, And thus we can conclude that $n\in B$ as was to be shown. Now since $|B|=N\in\mathbb{N}$, We conclude that $B$ is finite, And since $A\subseteq B$, We conclude that it must be the case that $A$ is also finite, But this contradicts the fact that $|A|=\aleph_0$ (as  $A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N})$)) and we’ve reached a contradiction. Therefore it must be the case that $\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$ as was to be shown. Proof that (3) and (4) are logically equivalent: Let’s define a new predicate $Q(n)\equiv \lnot P(n)$, Then by what we’ve just shown, We conclude that: $$\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)$$ But this implies that: $$\lnot\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv\lnot\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)$$ Now since: $$\lnot\forall N\in\mathbb{N},\exists N<n\in\mathbb{N}, Q(n)\equiv \\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, \lnot\lnot P(n)\equiv\\\equiv\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)$$ And since: $$\lnot\exists A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\forall n\in A, Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, \lnot Q(n)\equiv\\\equiv \forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A,\lnot\lnot P(n)\equiv\\\equiv \forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$$ We conclude that: $$\exists N\in\mathbb{N},\forall N<n\in\mathbb{N}, P(n)\equiv\forall A\in\mathscr{P}_{\aleph_0}(\mathbb{N}),\exists n\in A, P(n)$$ as was to be shown.

80,Constructing the reals using almost homomorphisms,Constructing the reals using almost homomorphisms,,"I'm learning set theory at the moment and there are a lost of gaps in my knowledge right now. I'm struggling to understand how the real numbers are constructed from equivalence classes of the set of almost homomorphisms on $\mathbb Z$. First of all, I feel like I should have a problem with equivalence classes even existing in ZFC. My main problem is that I don't really understand what an almost homomorphism is, and what it represents. As I currently understand, an almost homomorphism is a function such that $f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)$ is finite, so when we construct the reals we set each real number to be an equivalence class of the set of all those functions. I guess I'm having a hard time because I haven't seen any examples of almost homomorphisms and I just can't believe that there would be so many functions that are almost homomorphisms.

I'm struggling to understand how the real numbers are constructed from equivalence classes of the set of almost homomorphisms on $\mathbb Z$. First of all, I feel like I should have a problem with equivalence classes even existing in ZFC. My main problem is that I don't really understand what an almost homomorphism is, and what it represents. As I currently understand, an almost homomorphism is a function such that $f(x+y)-f(x)-f(y)$ is finite, so when we construct the reals we set each real number to be an equivalence class of the set of all those functions. I guess I'm having a hard time because I haven't seen any examples of almost homomorphisms and I just can't believe that there would be so many functions that are almost homomorphisms.

After proving that ${n\choose k}={n!\over k!(n-k)!}$ he tried to find extension to this formula His Question He tried to find a formula for ${(n)\choose (k)}$ $${(n)\choose (k)}=\text{number of sets of subsets of $n$ elements set such that the combined size of the }\\\text{subsets is $k$ and the subsets in each set has   no repeating elements}$$ For example: For $(4)\choose(3)$ we construct the following set: $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ I search how many sets of subsets of $A$, let's call the subsets $B_i$, there is such that the sum of $B_i$ in each set is equal $3$ and there is no repeated element from $A$. In this example we have the following sets: $$\{\{1,2,3\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{2,3\}\},\\\{\{2\},\{1,3\}\},\\\{\{3\},\{1,2\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}\},\\ \{\{1,2,4\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{2,4\}\},\\\{\{2\},\{1,4\}\},\\\{\{4\},\{1,2\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{2\},\{4\}\},\\\{\{1,3,4\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{3,4\}\},\\\{\{3\},\{1,4\}\},\\\{\{4\},\{1,3\}\},\\\{\{1\},\{3\},\{4\}\},\\\{\{1,2,3\}\},\\\{\{2\},\{3,4\}\},\\\{\{3\},\{2,4\}\},\\\{\{4\},\{2,3\}\},\\\{\{2\},\{3\},\{4\}\}$$Overall there is exactly $20$ sets, so we say ${(4)\choose(3)}=20$ What he tried ${(n)\choose(k)}={n\choose k}\times {(k)\choose(k)}$ Proof: The number of sets of $k$ unique elements from a set with $n$ unique elements is by definition $n\choose k$, and by definition for each such set we have exactly ${(k)\choose(k)}$ ways to create it using subsets of the set, thus ${(n)\choose(k)}={n\choose k}\times {(k)\choose(k)}$ What I tried Here he came to me, asking if I know a way to calculate ${(k)\choose(k)}$, I thought about some kind of recurrence relation: $${(k)\choose(k)}=1+\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac k2\rfloor}\left({k\choose i}\left[{(k-i)\choose(k-i)}-a_i^{(k)}\right]+b_i^{(k)}\right)$$ Where $a_i^{(k)}$ is the number duplicates I get from a single case of ${k\choose i}{(k-i)\choose(k-i)}$, I know it is not so clear, so here is an example: With $k=4,i=2$ I have ${4\choose2}(=6)$ ways to create a set with $2$ elements, and I have ${(4-2)\choose(4-2)}(=2)$ ways to complete it to have $4$ elements. Here is the list of cases: $$\overbrace{\{1,2\}\begin{cases}\{1,2\},\{3,4\}\\\{1,2\},\{3\},\{4\}\end{cases}}^{{4\choose2}\times{(4-2)\choose(4-2)}=12}\\\{1,3\}\begin{cases}\{1,3\},\{2,4\}\\\{1,3\},\{2\},\{4\}\end{cases}\\\{1,4\}\begin{cases}\{1,4\},\{2,3\}\\\{1,4\},\{2\},\{3\}\end{cases}\\\{2,3\}\begin{cases}\{2,3\},\{1,4\}\\\{2,3\},\{1\},\{4\}\end{cases}\\\{2,4\}\begin{cases}\{2,4\},\{1,3\}\\\{2,4\},\{1\},\{3\}\end{cases}\\\{3,4\}\begin{cases}\{3,4\},\{1,2\}\\\{3,4\},\{1\},\{2\}\end{cases}$$We can see that in each case we have exactly one case that appear in other case, hence $a_2^{(4)}=1$. And $b_i^{(k)}$ is the number of duplicates, in the example above we have exactly $3$ elements that appear more than once: $\{\{3,4\},\{1,2\}\},\{\{2,3\},\{1,4\}\},\{\{2,4\},\{1,3\}\}$, hence $b_2^{(4)}=3$ But this doesn't work because when we look on other $i$ we will find more duplicates, for example for $k=4,i=1$ I have the case of $\{1\},\{2,4\},\{3\}$, this is duplicate of the third from last case from when $k=4,i=2$. Here we both are stuck, can someone please help us? Thanks Edit: @saulspatz point out that ${(k)\choose (k)}=B(k)$, where $B(k)$ is bell number of $k$. From Wikipedia I found that $B(k)=\sum_{j=0}^k\left\{{k\atop j}\right\}$, where $\left\{{k\atop j}\right\}$ is Stirling numbers of second kind$=S(k,j)$. With this I get that $$\boxed{{(n)\choose (k)}={n\choose k}{(k)\choose (k)}={n\choose k}B(k)={n\choose k}\sum_{j=0}^k\left(\left\{{k\atop j}\right\}\right)={n\choose k}\sum_{j=0}^k\left(\frac1{j!}\sum_{i=0}^j\left((-1)^{j-i}{j\choose i}i^k\right)\right)}$$","My little brother asked me a question that I cannot answer and I would love to get some help with it.
