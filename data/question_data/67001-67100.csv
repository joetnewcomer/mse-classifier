The wizard has $2n$ cards; for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$, there are two cards labelled $i$. Initially, the wizard places all cards face down in a row, in unknown order. You may repeatedly make moves of the following form: you point to any $k$ of the cards. The wizard then turns those cards face up. If any two of the cards match, the game is over and you win. Otherwise, you must look away, while the wizard arbitrarily permutes the $k$ chosen cards and then turns them back face-down. Then, it is your turn again.

Beginning from the trigonometric identities $$ \eqalign{ \cos(a+b) &= \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b \cr \sin(a+b) &= \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b \cr } $$ and in order to ease calculation, I considered the following BNF grammar: $$ \eqalign{ 0 &\rightarrow 00 - 11 \cr 1 &\rightarrow 10 + 01 \cr } $$ where $0$ is assumed to represent a $\cos$ and $1$ a $\sin$. I got this way : $$ \eqalign{ \cos (a+b+c) &= \cos((a+b)+c) \cr &= (00-11)0-(10+01)1 \cr &= 000 - 110 - 101 - 011 \cr & which\ is\ interpreted \cr &::\ \cos a \cos b \cos c - \sin a \sin b \cos c - \sin a \cos b \sin c - \cos a \sin b \sin c \cr } $$ Observing that from the set ${000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111}$ we take the elements with odd number of zeroes(cosines) $k$ and sign $(-)^{3-k}$. Continuing with $\cos (a+b+c+d)$ I got : $$ \eqalign{ \cos (a+b+c+d) &= \cos((a+b)+(c+d)) \cr &= (00-11)(00-11) -(10+01)(10+01) \cr &= 0000 - 0011 - 1100 + 1111 - 1010 -1001 - 0110 -0101 \cr &::\ even\ number\ of\ 0's(cosines)=k,\ sign\ (-)^{k \over 2} \cr } $$",,"['calculus', 'combinatorics', 'trigonometry']"

12,What am I counting wrong?,What am I counting wrong?,,"EDIT: I made a mistake in the beginning, the second condition has changed. Sorry for this. I'm asked to count the number of sets of 4 elements that satisfy the two following conditions: 1) Each element of the set is a two-digit number (from 10 to 99). 2) There are no repeated digits in the set. What I've done is separate the sets in two disjoint cases. The ones that have an element with the digit 0 and the ones that don't. The sets from the first case have three elements that don't have a $0$ and one that does.

Applying the same reasoning to the rest there are $2C(5,2)$ and $2C(3,2)$ possible elements. Order doesn't matter in a set, so I divide by $4!$.

That is $a^{n-1}b^k$ for $k=0,1,\ldots,n$ Now, my textbook states the following Each term of the form $a^{n-k}b^k$ arises by choosing the variable $b$   from $k$ of the pairs of brackets on the right hand side of the   equation and the variable $a$ from the remaining $n-k$ pairs of   brackets. My question is now, why? There is no proof given for this, and I am struggling to understand why the above holds.For a very simple expansion, where $k=1$ and $n=2$, we have 2 terms of the form $ab$, here its pretty easy to see from $ (a+b)(a+b) = a(a+b) + b(a+b) = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab $ why the statement in the book holds for this case. But, for bigger ones, such as $(a+b)^3$ i can't see it. I can see that there is 3 ways of choosing one $b$ and two $a$, for the term $a^2b$ when looking at $(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)$, but I cant relate it to the expansion of them, if that makes sense?",,"['combinatorics', 'binomial-theorem']"

98,Combinatorics Arrangement Problem,Combinatorics Arrangement Problem,,"This is a combinatorics question: Imagine you have an $8\times8$ empty chessboard. You have $10$ identical pawns. How many different ways can you place those $10$ pawns on the chessboard such that each pawn is at least (Euclidean) distance $X$ away from any of the other pawns? This is just an example, but what I would like is a function where I can give it the dimensions of the chessboard, the number of pawns that must be on the chessboard, and the minimum distance each pawn must be from any of the other pawns, and then the function returns the number of possible arrangements. If you don't know how to solve this problem, could you please let me know what subfield of combinatorics that I can learn to solve this problem? For example, is there a clever way of using inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem? Lastly, if the above problem is too hard, how would you do this if instead of a chessboard that is $8\times 8$, you had a long board that was $64\times 1$?
