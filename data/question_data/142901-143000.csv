So below I state the definitions as I understand them, and I hope that someone can tell me whether or not the definitions I have given are correct, specifically if what I have identified as the difference between them is correct. The limit $L$ of a function $f$ exists at a point $p$ if and only if: $\forall\epsilon>0$ , $\exists\delta>0$ such that if $x$ is in the punctured $\delta$ -neighbourhood of $p$ , then $f(x)$ must be in the given $\epsilon$ -neighbourhood of $L$ (because $x$ is never equal to $p$ , it doesn't matter if the $\epsilon$ -neighbourhood does or does not contain $L$ , nor what the value of $L$ is, aslong as it is a real number).

For example, if $f(x)$ is a constant function.. or if $f(x)$ is constant in a neighbourhood around $L$ .. or if we have something like the case of $\lim_{x\to0}x\sin(\frac{1}{x})=0$ where $f(x)$ hits $L$ at an ever-increasing frequency as $x$ approaches $0$ . Essentially, in any situation where we can have $f(x)=L$ for $x$ -values inside the punctured $\delta$ -neighbourhood, the limit definition as I have described it breaks down and doesn't work as it should; the definition would say that the limit doesn't exist when it clearly does. Thus it is not true that ""it doesn't matter if the $\epsilon$ -neighbourhood does or does not contain $L$ "".. there are many cases in which it does matter, and so we should specify that, in general, the $\epsilon$ -neighbourhood must be unpunctured, so that we account for such cases in our definition. And of course when we have $f(x)\ne L$ for all $x$ in any punctured $\delta$ -neighbourhood of $p$ we can create, then the fact that there is an $L$ sitting in every $\epsilon$ -neighbourhood given has no bearing on the limit statement; it does no harm.","I am trying to make sure I understand the definition of limit existence at a point, the definition of continuity at a point, and the exact difference between the two definitions.

Prove: $\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}f(ch)=\displaystyle \lim_{ch \to 0}f(ch)$ for $c\neq 0$ , which is equivalent to: If $c\neq 0$ and $\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}f(ch)=L$ , then $\displaystyle \lim_{ch \to 0}f(ch)=L$ $\quad$ and $\quad$ If $c\neq 0$ and $\displaystyle \lim_{ch \to 0}f(ch)=L$ , then $\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}f(ch)=L$ We will only prove the first implication (the converse is completed similarly): By assumption: $\displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}f(ch)=L \iff \forall \varepsilon \gt 0 \ \exists \delta \gt 0 \  \forall h \in \mathbb R \left [ 0 \lt |h| \lt \delta \rightarrow |f(ch)-L| \lt \varepsilon \right ]$ We want to show that for an arbitrary $\varepsilon$ , we can construct a $\delta$ such that $\color{red}{\forall ch} \in \mathbb R \left [ 0 \lt |ch| \lt \delta \rightarrow |f(ch)-L| \lt \varepsilon \right]$ For $\varepsilon$ , we know by assumption that there is a $\delta_{\varepsilon}$ such that: $\forall h \in \mathbb R \left [ 0 \lt |h| \lt \delta_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow |f(ch)-L| \lt \varepsilon \right ]$ Now, consider a $\delta ^* = \min\left(\delta_{\varepsilon},\frac{\delta_{\varepsilon}}{|c|}\right)$ . If $0 \lt |h| \lt \delta^* \leq \delta_{\varepsilon}$ , by assumption we have: $|f(ch)-L| \lt \varepsilon$ . Further, if $0 \lt |h| \lt \delta^* \leq \frac{\delta_{\varepsilon}}{|c|}$ , then $0 \lt |ch| \lt |c|\delta^*$ . Therefore, let our desired $\delta$ be defined as $\delta = |c|\delta^*$ . As long as $0\lt|ch| \lt \delta$ , all of our criteria is met. In the above proof, I made use of the following statement: $\color{red}{\forall ch} \in \mathbb R \left [ 0 \lt |ch| \lt \delta \rightarrow |f(ch)-L| \lt \varepsilon \right]$ Through my brief experience in maths, the universally quantified object $ch$ is atypical. I suspect the proper way to denote this is by establishing a function of the form: $g(h)=ch$ and then defining a single symbol as representing its output. i.e. something like $s_h :=g(h)$ . More specifically, we should write $g$ formally as: $g: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ where $h \mapsto ch$ . We would then rewrite the statement as: $\color{red}{\forall s_h} \in \mathbb R \left [ 0 \lt |s_h| \lt \delta \rightarrow |f(s_h)-L| \lt \varepsilon \right]$ This seems to emulate the more familiar notation of a universal quantifier, where only one symbol follows the quantifier. I do not really know the deep theory behind first-order logic, but I suspect the reason this proof ""works out"" is because my new symbol $s_h$ has the capacity of sweeping through all objects within $\mathbb R$ . Said differently, the previously defined function $g$ can be shown to be surjective with respect to $\mathbb R$ .

55,Does being well approximated by a polynomial characterize higher differentiability?,Does being well approximated by a polynomial characterize higher differentiability?,,"Suppose $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ admits a polynomial $\sum_{k=0}^n\lambda_k(x-a)^k$ of degree $\leq n$ satisfying $f(x)-\sum_{k=0}^n\lambda_k(x-a)^k\in \mathrm o(|x-a|^n)$ as $x\to a$ . Then dividing by powers of $(x-a)$ shows $$\begin{aligned}\lambda_0 & =\lim_{x\to a}fx, \\ \lambda_1 & =\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{fx-\lambda_0}{x-a}, \\ \lambda _2 & =\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{fx-fa-\lambda_1(x-a)}{(x-a)^2}=\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{\tfrac{fx-fa}{x-a}-\lambda_1}{x-a}, \\  & \vdots \\ \lambda_n & = \lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{fx-\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\lambda_k(x-a)^k}{(x-a)^n}. \end{aligned}$$ Thus the asymptotic condition determines the polynomial, so it is unique when it exists. If $f$ is furthermore continuous at $x=a$ then $\lambda_0=fa$ whence $\lambda_1=f^\prime(a)$ . If $f$ is $n$ -times differentiable at $x=a$ then Peano's form of Taylor's theorem tells us $R^n_af\in \mathrm o(|x-a|^n)$ as $x\to a$ . Here $R^n_af(x)=f(x)-j^n_af(x)$ and $$j^n_af(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\tfrac 1{k!}f^{(k)}(a)(x-a)^k$$ is the $n^\text{th}$ order Taylor series of $f$ about $x=a$ . By uniqueness we therefore have $\lambda_k=\tfrac 1{k!}f^{(k)}(a)$ . For instance taking $k=0,1,2$ gives $$\tfrac 12f^{(2)}(a)=\lambda _2  =\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{fx-fa-f^\prime(a)(x-a)}{(x-a)^2}=\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{\tfrac{fx-fa}{x-a}-f^\prime(a)}{x-a}.$$ I am interested in the converse: are continuous maps which are well approximated by a polynomial of degree $\leq n$ necessarily $n$ -times differentiable?

Does it follow that $f$ is $n$ -times differentiable at $x=a$ , with $\lambda_k=\tfrac 1{k!}f^{(k)}(a)$ ? Already for $k=2$ this amounts to the assertion $$\tfrac 12f^{(2)}(a)=\lambda _2  =\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{fx-fa-f^\prime(a)(x-a)}{(x-a)^2}=\lim_{x\to a}\tfrac{\tfrac{fx-fa}{x-a}-f^\prime(a)}{x-a}.$$ This is not obvious at all to me.","Suppose admits a polynomial of degree satisfying as .

I think the title is about as good as I could get in terms of description.

My proof was as follows: Our goal is to find an $N$ that satisfies the inequality: $|\sqrt{x_n|} - \sqrt{x}| \lt \epsilon$ with epsilon being arbitrary.

Then allow $\epsilon > 0$ to be arbitrary and choose an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ satisfying: $|x_n - x| \lt \epsilon^2 + 2 \epsilon \sqrt{x}$ For $n \ge N$ we find after some algebra (to save typing the above backwards) $|\sqrt{x_n|} - \sqrt{x}| \lt \epsilon$ Which shows that given the limit we can choose an $N$ for any given $\epsilon$ and find that all $n \ge N$ will be inside the $\epsilon$ -neighborhood of $\sqrt{x}$ .

Problem: We say that a sequence $x_{n}\; , n = 1, 2,\cdots ,$ Cesaro converges to $a,$    if   $$ \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}=a. $$   A function    $f$    is Cesaro continuous at    $a$    if    $x_{n}\to a$ (in Cesaro mean)    implies    $f(x_{n})\to a$ (in Cesaro mean).    Prove that, if   $f : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$    is Cesaro continuous at    $0$    and    $f(0) = 0,$ then $f$ is linear.",,"['real-analysis', 'analysis', 'limits', 'cesaro-summable']"
