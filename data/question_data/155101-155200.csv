It was suggested I ask it here. My son was jotting down some multiplications for school and asked me if there were many numbers that, when multiplied by their mirror image, resulted in a palindromic number (e.g. 221 x 122 = 26962). I made a quick Python script to test this and found the results rather surprising. For 3-digit numbers, there are 11 results. For 4-digit number, there are 23. The number of positive results doubles approximately with each addition of a digit, reaching 642 results with 9-digit numbers and 1118 results with 10-digit numbers. As you can see from the table below, the ratio of 2 seems to decrease with every iteration after the 6th. This is the longest number we could test because calculating time increases exponentially by a factor of approximately 10, reaching 3 hours for the last example. What I find interesting is that in all of the above results, with no exception, the factors are invariably composed of zeros, ones and twos. There's never anything else. For example: 2100110011 x 1100110012 = 2310352049402530132. I asked a mathematician friend — not remotely involved with number theory or arithmetic – and he said it might be related to ""carry digits"" messing things up. It's true that for 1-digit numbers, excluding the trivial zero, there are only 3 possible examples (1, 2 and 3) before the symmetry breaks (4 x 4 is 16 which isn't palindromic). But when multiplying huge 10-digit numbers you get tons of ""carry digits"" as can clearly be seen from the results: these can include any digit as seen in the example above. It does seem to have some impact, though. For a test for n digits, all the multiplication results have the exact same number of digits, which is always 2n-1. e.g. 4-digit numbers always give 7-digit results. I am sure there must be a deep reason for never seeing digits above 2 in the factors, but for the life of me I can't understand what it is.

Assume for a contradiction that there are only finitely many primes, which we can list as $p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, form the product  \begin{align*} N = \mathop{\Pi}\limits_{i=1}^m p_i + 1. \end{align*} From here there are several ways to proceed. But, this is where I find myself getting confused. Since $\mathbb{Z}$ is closed under multiplication and addition, $N \in \mathbb{Z}$, and since $N > p_i, \forall i$, $N$ is not a prime. So, there exists some $p_i$ such that $p_i \mid N$, so $\exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, a \cdot p_i = N$, i.e., $a \cdot p_i = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot p_3 \cdots p_m + 1$.

From here, perhaps we could subtract the product of $m - 1$ terms, clearly an integer by closure under multiplication, from $a$, also an integer.

My attempt: The square-root of a non-negative integer can either be a rational number or an irrational number. When it is a rational number it has to be an integer. It cannot be anything else (I do not exactly know why but my mind says so). So by this logic, if $\sqrt{2017+n^2},n\in N$ is a rational number , it has to be a positive integer.

54,Requirements for an integer root of cubic equation,Requirements for an integer root of cubic equation,,"If we have the quadratic equation $$a x^2 + b x + c = 0$$ with $a,b,c$ integers, then a requirement for $x$ to have an integer solution is for $b^2 - 4ac$ to be a square integer. This condition is necessary, but not sufficient. However it is simple enough to sometimes be useful when solving Diophantine equations. Furthermore, note that this does not come from Vieta's formulas . While those are useful for other purposes, they do not yield a restrictive form in the integers like the condition on $b^2 - 4ac$ extracted from the general solution. So with that introduction out of the way: I would like to know if there are similar conditions for the cubic equation $$a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0.$$ In the quadratic case, if one root is integer, the other is at least rational. But in the cubic case, one root could be integer, with the others irrational or imaginary. So it looks like it would be harder to extract such a condition from the general solution ( vanderbilt.edu , wikipedia ). In particular, just like in casus irreducibilis where imaginary values will invariably show up during calculation of the roots even when all the roots are real, it seems inevitable that we could have irrationals  like $\sqrt{n}$ show up only to cancel later in the calculation of an integer root. So how can we extract from the general cubic solution some useful conditions on $a,b,c,d$ for an integer solution?  Particularly nice, in analogy to the quadratic case, is if there is some term that is required to be a perfect cube.","If we have the quadratic equation with integers, then a requirement for to have an integer solution is for to be a square integer.

56,"GEB: How to write ""b is a MIU-number"" in TNT notation","GEB: How to write ""b is a MIU-number"" in TNT notation",,"( NB: This question requires access to, and familiarity with, the book Gödel, Escher, Bach , by Douglas Hofstadter.  Unfortunately, I am not able to make the question entirely self-contained.  In any case, for a description of the MIU system, see here , and for one of TNT, see here .) This question refers to p. 263 of the latest American edition of Gödel, Escher, Bach . In that page, Hofstadter writes (my emphasis): ...I pointed out in Chapter VIII that even such a simple arithmetical predicate as "" b is a power of 10"" is very tricky to code into TNT-notation—and the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" is a lot more complicated than that! Still it can be found , ... I emphasized the last sentence above because, in my opinion, the book's entire rendition of Gödel's proof (arguably its centerpiece) rests squarely on it .  If that assertion must be taken on faith, then the book's entire proof must be taken on faith. It's terribly disappointing that in a book of this size, one that makes such demands of its readers, and one that is filled with massive illustrations (such as the full sequence of a viral genome, on p. 176), the author chose not to provide explicitly such a crucial exhibit in the argument.  Yes, I know that the resulting TNT string would be huge (even before substituting SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS0 for every occurrence of b ), and basically incomprehensible (though I doubt it would be any more so than the genome alluded to earlier), but it is such an important bit of evidence that to have to take its existence on faith is, as I said, terribly disappointing. Therefore, as this question title says, I am looking for the translation of the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" to TNT notation. I have searched online for this translation without success. As I already alluded to, I realize that the translation of this predicate to TNT notation could result in an enormous string, perhaps unmanageably so. In that case, the next best thing would be a scaffold written in a formal language L more expressive (hence more succinct) than TNT, but from which one could translate into TNT through a straightforward process of expansion (i.e. replacement of succinct L expressions by full-blown TNT expressions). For example, such a language L may include a symbol $\leq$ that could be translated to ""lax TNT"" by applying the following substitution: $$a\leq b \to \exists c:(a+c)=b$$ ...or to ""austere TNT"": $$a\leq a^\prime \to \exists a^{\prime\prime}:(a+a^{\prime\prime})=a^\prime$$ Likewise, L could include a symbol $\lt$, that could be translated to TNT with the substitution: $$a \lt b \to \mathbf{S}a \le b \;,$$ or $$a \lt a^\prime \to \mathbf{S}a \le a^\prime\;.$$ The point here is that the LHSs above are considerably more succinct than the corresponding RHSs, and an expression containing the former can be translated ""mechanically"" to one consisting only of valid TNT symbols through relatively straightforward substitutions.  Therefore, L may be thought of as TNT augmented with a finite set of ""abbreviations"", like those exemplified by $\le$ and $\lt$ above. It's not hard to see that, with enough ""abbreviations"" of this sort, one may be able to translate the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" to an L-string of manageable length, even if the corresponding TNT string is a couple of orders of magnitude larger. For what it's worth, I know that the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" is equivalent to the following predicate: b is a number consisting of $3$ followed by $0$'s and $1$'s, where the number $n_1$ of $1$'s satisfies $n_1 \not \equiv 0 \pmod 3$. (See this answer by Eric Wofsey for a nice proof of this equivalence.) Therefore, to answer this question, it would suffice to translate this alternative, but equivalent, predicate to TNT notation. UPDATE Below are two versions of my rendition of "" b is a MIU-number"" (wrapped at 100-characters per line) using my interpretation of Y. Forman's answer. (The purpose of these print outs is only to get a sense of the actual size and composition of these strings.  It's not meant to be illuminating in any other way.) The first version (length = 1,497, including two occurrences of b ) deviates from austere TNT notation in two ways: Instead of, e.g., SSSSSSSSSS0 , I write 10 . Instead of primes ( ' ), I use numerical suffixes to generate variable names; thus, instead of a''''''''' , I use a9 .

This question requires access to, and familiarity with, the book Gödel, Escher, Bach , by Douglas Hofstadter.  Unfortunately, I am not able to make the question entirely self-contained.  In any case, for a description of the MIU system, see here , and for one of TNT, see here .) This question refers to p. 263 of the latest American edition of Gödel, Escher, Bach . In that page, Hofstadter writes (my emphasis): ...I pointed out in Chapter VIII that even such a simple arithmetical predicate as "" b is a power of 10"" is very tricky to code into TNT-notation—and the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" is a lot more complicated than that! Still it can be found , ... I emphasized the last sentence above because, in my opinion, the book's entire rendition of Gödel's proof (arguably its centerpiece) rests squarely on it .  If that assertion must be taken on faith, then the book's entire proof must be taken on faith. It's terribly disappointing that in a book of this size, one that makes such demands of its readers, and one that is filled with massive illustrations (such as the full sequence of a viral genome, on p. 176), the author chose not to provide explicitly such a crucial exhibit in the argument.  Yes, I know that the resulting TNT string would be huge (even before substituting SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS0 for every occurrence of b ), and basically incomprehensible (though I doubt it would be any more so than the genome alluded to earlier), but it is such an important bit of evidence that to have to take its existence on faith is, as I said, terribly disappointing. Therefore, as this question title says, I am looking for the translation of the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" to TNT notation. I have searched online for this translation without success. As I already alluded to, I realize that the translation of this predicate to TNT notation could result in an enormous string, perhaps unmanageably so. In that case, the next best thing would be a scaffold written in a formal language L more expressive (hence more succinct) than TNT, but from which one could translate into TNT through a straightforward process of expansion (i.e. replacement of succinct L expressions by full-blown TNT expressions). For example, such a language L may include a symbol $\leq$ that could be translated to ""lax TNT"" by applying the following substitution: $$a\leq b \to \exists c:(a+c)=b$$ ...or to ""austere TNT"": $$a\leq a^\prime \to \exists a^{\prime\prime}:(a+a^{\prime\prime})=a^\prime$$ Likewise, L could include a symbol $\lt$, that could be translated to TNT with the substitution: $$a \lt b \to \mathbf{S}a \le b \;,$$ or $$a \lt a^\prime \to \mathbf{S}a \le a^\prime\;.$$ The point here is that the LHSs above are considerably more succinct than the corresponding RHSs, and an expression containing the former can be translated ""mechanically"" to one consisting only of valid TNT symbols through relatively straightforward substitutions.  Therefore, L may be thought of as TNT augmented with a finite set of ""abbreviations"", like those exemplified by $\le$ and $\lt$ above. It's not hard to see that, with enough ""abbreviations"" of this sort, one may be able to translate the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" to an L-string of manageable length, even if the corresponding TNT string is a couple of orders of magnitude larger. For what it's worth, I know that the predicate "" b is a MIU-number"" is equivalent to the following predicate: b is a number consisting of $3$ followed by $0$'s and $1$'s, where the number $n_1$ of $1$'s satisfies $n_1 \not \equiv 0 \pmod 3$. (See this answer by Eric Wofsey for a nice proof of this equivalence.) Therefore, to answer this question, it would suffice to translate this alternative, but equivalent, predicate to TNT notation. UPDATE Below are two versions of my rendition of "" b is a MIU-number"" (wrapped at 100-characters per line) using my interpretation of Y. Forman's answer. (The purpose of these print outs is only to get a sense of the actual size and composition of these strings.  It's not meant to be illuminating in any other way.) The first version (length = 1,497, including two occurrences of b ) deviates from austere TNT notation in two ways: Instead of, e.g., SSSSSSSSSS0 , I write 10 . Instead of primes ( ' ), I use numerical suffixes to generate variable names; thus, instead of a''''''''' , I use a9 .

It can be proved that for any prime $p$ and integer $n$ such that $p\mid f(n)$ we have either $p=3$ or $p\equiv\pm1\pmod 9$ (see below). Indeed, suppose that for prime number $p$ and integer $n$ we have $p\mid n^3-3n+1$ . Firstly, note that if $x=t+\frac{1}{t}$ , then $$ f(x)=t^3+\frac{1}{t^3}+1=\frac{t^6+t^3+1}{t^3}. $$ Now we will consider two cases: Case 1. In $\mathbb{F}_p\backslash\{0\}$ there is a $a$ such that $n\equiv a+\frac{1}{a}\pmod p$ . Then, we have $$ a^6+a^3+1\equiv 0\pmod p, $$ so $a^9\equiv 1\pmod p$ . Moreover, $x^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod p$ . Thus, the order $d$ of $a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p^{\times}$ must divide $\gcd(p-1,9)$ . If $d\in\{1,3\}$ , then $a^3\equiv 1\pmod p$ , so $p=3$ . Otherwise, $d=9$ and $9\mid p-1$ , as desired. Case 2. There is no $a\in\mathbb{F}_p$ such that $n\equiv a+\frac{1}{a}$ . Then, we can consider the extension $\mathbb{F}_p(a)$ , where $a$ is a root of the polynomial $x^2-nx+1=0$ (which is irreducible in $\mathbb{F}_p$ due to our assumption). Note that $|\mathbb{F}_p(a)|=p^2$ since the degree of this extension is 2. Similarly, as in the first case we deduce that in $\mathbb{F}_p(a)$ $$ a^6+a^3+1=0,~\text{so}~a^9=1. $$ If $d$ is the order of $a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p(a)^{\times}$ , then $d\mid\gcd(p^2-1,9)$ . As in the first case, if $d\in\{1,3\}$ , then $a^3=1$ in $\mathbb{F}_p(a)$ and $p=3$ . Otherwise, $d=9$ , so $9\mid p^2-1$ . Therefore, $p\equiv\pm 1\pmod 9$ , as desired.

Let $Q,R$ be two integer quadratic forms: Does $V(Q) = V(R)$ imply $Q \sim R$?   If it's true how would it be proved? If false when does it fail? I'm not assuming that the QFs have the same discriminant or are positive definite.",,"['number-theory', 'quadratic-forms']"

Consider a prime $q$ that is a factor of $n$ and   let $q^k\ ||\ n$ . Then $q^k$ does not divide $n \choose q$ and is coprime to $a^{n−q}$ and hence the coefficient of $X^q$ is not zero $(\mod n\ )$. Thus $((X + a)^n − (X^n + a))$ is not identically zero over $Z^n$. I am very new to number theory and it is not mentioned anywhere in the paper what $\|$ denotes.

96,Arithmetic Derivatives: Arithmetic Logarithmic Derivative Problem,Arithmetic Derivatives: Arithmetic Logarithmic Derivative Problem,,"In Calculus, whenever we see a constant and want to take the derivative of it, it always is 0. However in Number Theory, we have something called the arithmetic derivative in which we can differentiate to get some nonzero term.  So we can denote the arithmetic derivative the same way as in calculus, say for some $x$, we can say $x'$ to be the arithmetic derivative. Some properties of arithmetic derivatives are that: For all primes, the arithmetic derivative is $1$. Product Rule: $(xy)'=x'y+xy'$ $0'=1'=0$ Now, there is also some lesser-known sub-part to the arithmetic derivative called the Arithmetic Logarithmic Derivative, $L(n)$, which is equal to $\frac{n'}{n}$. My question is that less than $100$, how many pairs of distinct positive integers (call them $a$ and $b$) does $L(a)=L(b)$?","In Calculus, whenever we see a constant and want to take the derivative of it, it always is 0.
