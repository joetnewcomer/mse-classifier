If $\delta_P=1$ , then $P$ tiles the plane: having arbitrarily good packings implies that $P$ can cover arbitrarily large $N\times N$ squares, and from there the result follows via a compactness argument. We can then ask: among polyominoes on $n\ge 7$ cells that do not tile the plane, which one achieves the highest density? Call this maximal value $\Delta_n$ . For each $n$ , $\Delta_n<1$ , though of course in the limit for large $n$ it approaches $1$ . As a simple lower bound, we always have $\Delta_n\ge n/(n+1)$ , as exhibited by the polyomino given by taking all but the first square in a spiral of length $n+1$ around the origin; once we plug the hole, it tiles the plane without gaps, but the hole cannot be filled. For instance, with $n=7$ : In contrast, putting remotely nontrivial upper bounds on $\Delta_n$ in general should be exceedingly difficult or impossible, since any computable upper bound less than 1 would yield an algorithm to decide the tiling problem for polyominoes, which is suspected not to exist.

Some questions: Is the sequence $\Delta_7,\Delta_8,\ldots$ monotonically increasing? I suspect not. When does $\Delta_n$ first exceed $n/(n+1)$ ? I don't actually know that it does, but I strongly suspect so for reasons described above. When $n=7$ I have not found any packings of density greater than $7/8$ , although only for one of the four non-tiling heptominoes (the one pictured above) have I proven this is optimal.

36,Can every polyomino of even size be tiled by $L$-trominoes when scaled up by a factor of $3$?,Can every polyomino of even size be tiled by -trominoes when scaled up by a factor of ?,L 3,"The $L$ -tromino does not tile a $3\times 3$ square. However, it can tile $3\times3$ squares glued together in various ways: I am interested in the polyominoes $P$ for which the $L$ -tromino can tile a copy of $P$ scaled up by a factor of $3$ along both axes. It is easy to see that some $P$ will fail, such as any $1\times k$ rectangle for odd $k$ . However, it appears that every polyomino $P$ with an even number of cells can be tiled by $L$ shapes when it is scaled up by $3$ . This holds for all polyominoes $P$ with $2, 4, 6, \ldots, 12$ cells. One might be tempted to argue from induction: given a polyomino $P$ of size $2k$ , subtract a $3\times 6$ domino from $P$ (which can be tiled), and tile the remaining size- $(2k-2)$ polyomino with $L$ s by the inductive hypothesis. The problem with this is that there are arbitrarily large polyominoes for which it is not possible to remove a domino and leave a single connected polyomino behind; in fact, there are polyominoes that cannot be split into any collection of smaller polyominoes of even size. ( This is one example.)

However, it can tile squares glued together in various ways: I am interested in the polyominoes for which the -tromino can tile a copy of scaled up by a factor of along both axes. It is easy to see that some will fail, such as any rectangle for odd . However, it appears that every polyomino with an even number of cells can be tiled by shapes when it is scaled up by . This holds for all polyominoes with cells. One might be tempted to argue from induction: given a polyomino of size , subtract a domino from (which can be tiled), and tile the remaining size- polyomino with s by the inductive hypothesis. The problem with this is that there are arbitrarily large polyominoes for which it is not possible to remove a domino and leave a single connected polyomino behind; in fact, there are polyominoes that cannot be split into any collection of smaller polyominoes of even size.

Here is an example with $n=8$ . Let $P(a,n)=\text{product of lengths of the line segments}$ . What is $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(e,n)$ ? ( $e$ is Euler's constant) Why I chose $a=e$ Here are plots of $P(a,n)$ against $n$ with $a=0.99e$ , $\space a=e$ and $\space a=1.01e$ . It seems that if $a<e$ then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(a,n)=\infty$ , and if $a>e$ then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(a,n)=0$ . So $a=e$ seems to be a critical value.

What makes this difficult What makes my question difficult for me, is that I cannot find exact expressions for the lengths. For example, with $a=e$ and $n=8$ , the length of the shortest line segments is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{e}}\sin \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$ where $x-\sin x=\frac{\pi}{4}$ .

Here is the crux of the question, for a circle, I am confident that the edge point lies on the circumference of the circle if $|\theta - \phi| < \text{threshold}$.

75,Maximal area covered by two triangles in unit circle,Maximal area covered by two triangles in unit circle,,"What is the maximal area covered by two triangles in a unit circle? There are no restrictions other than that. They can overlap, touch the circle, not touch the circle etc. So far I have shown In an optimal solution all six vertices have to lie on the unit circle. If the two triangles are not overlapping, the optimal solution has area $2$ . Using two equilateral triangles, the maximal area is $\sqrt 3\approx 1.7320508$ . Explanations AD 1: This is true since any triangle with not all vertices touching the unit circle will be entirely contained in a larger triangle where all three vertices lie on the unit circle. AD 2: The optimal non-overlapping solution is a square formed by two triangles meeting in a diameter of the circle. This can be derived from a few simple principles: (a) Given a triangle with all vertices on the unit circle we can always increase the area by fixing two vertices using their distance as base and then move the third vertex to the middle of the circular segment between the other two to maximize the height with out changing the base. This makes optimal non-overlapping solutions consist of isosceles triangles. (b) Any non-overlapping triangle contained within one half  of the circle can be enlarged by a parallel displacement of one side until it either meets the diameter of the circle or a side of the other triangle. This effectively makes the two triangles share one side so they form a 4-gon. (c) The optimal 4-gon with vertices on a circle is a square which can be obtained by applying principle (a) four times namely to each of the triangles formed by dividing the 4-gon by a diagonal. So the optimal non-overlapping solution will be an inscribed square of area $2$ . AD 3: I wrote a ""dirty"" equation for the area as a function of the radian distance between a vertex from each triangle and found that the area was maximized when the six vertices where evenly spread out forming a hexagram (star of David). Remark I suspect the optimal solution is actually $2$ so that the triangles do not need to overlap. In other words, we gain nothing from allowing the triangles to overlap, if I am right. I hope someone can provide a nice and clear way to either prove or disprove this conjecture.","What is the maximal area covered by two triangles in a unit circle?

Tu. From Definition 8.1 and Remark 8.2 (and definitions from Section 2. see below), we have that A. $T_pM = T_pU$ B. and $C_p^{\infty}M = C_p^{\infty}U$ , where (B) implies (A). I believe both equalities are really equalities are not isomorphisms (see this question , my previous question and my other previous question ). This question says the differential of inclusion map of smooth manifolds is an inclusion map of tangent spaces. Question 1. If A and B are indeed equalities, then is it really that $T_pS \subseteq T_pM$ (this may or may not be vector subspace, but I think it is) for $S \subseteq M$ a regular/embedded submanifold and not merely that $T_pS$ is (vector space) isomorphic to a vector subspace of $T_pM$ (so $T_pS$ is embedded, in the vector space sense , but probably equivalent to the manifold sense , in $T_pM$ )? Question 2. If A and B are indeed equalities and the answer to (1) is yes, then, then how do we see this from Definition 8.1 and Remark 8.2 with $C_p^\infty S$ and $C_p^{\infty} M$ ? I think I can kind of see this geometrically with $S=S^1$ , $M=\mathbb R^2$ and $p=(1,0)$ with $T_pS^1$ , as the vertical line isomorphic to $\mathbb R$ with $p$ as origin, being a vector subspace of $T_p\mathbb R^2$ , as the plane isomorphic to $\mathbb R^2$ with $p$ as origin but I don't quite see how a map $D:C_p^{\infty}S \to \mathbb R$ is also a map $D:C_p^{\infty}M \to \mathbb R$ . I think we somehow do some kind of smooth extensions, but most of the smooth extensions I've encountered are from open submanifolds or open subsets are not arbitrary regular submanifolds. Maybe $C_p^{\infty} S \supseteq C_p^\infty M$ or something. Question 3. If (A) is merely an isomorphism and not equality, then why exactly? Is it actually that (B) is also merely an isomorphism and not equality, and if so, then why exactly? Note: Other definitions of tangent space of submanifold seem to be explicit in being subsets of tangent spaces (at the same point) of the original manifold.

This question says the differential of inclusion map of smooth manifolds is an inclusion map of tangent spaces. Question 1. If A and B are indeed equalities, then is it really that (this may or may not be vector subspace, but I think it is) for a regular/embedded submanifold and not merely that is (vector space) isomorphic to a vector subspace of (so is embedded, in the vector space sense , but probably equivalent to the manifold sense , in )?

Based on the Euler characteristic, $v-e+f=2$, we know that $v-e+6=2$, or $v+4=e$. Let $n_i$ be the number of edges on the $i$th face. Then $\sum n_i=2e$. Each face has at least $3$ edges, so each $n_i \geq 3$. No face can have more than $5$ edges (because if there were a hexagonal face, it would have to meet $6$ other distinct faces, causing there to be more than $6$ total faces). So each $n_i \leq 5$. We know there are at least $5$ vertices, since the only convex polyhedron with $4$ vertices is the tetrahedron. Since no face has more than $5$ edges, no face has more than $5$ vertices. So there are at most $5 \cdot 6 = 30$ vertices, but this over counts. Each vertex is incident to at least $3$ faces, so is counted at least $3$ times. Thus we get the upper bound $v \leq 30/3=10$. Thus $5 \leq v \leq 10$ and using the Euler characteristic we get $9 \leq e \leq 14$, so $18 \leq 2e = \sum n_i \leq 28$.

Three or more pentagons also will not work (we considered different ways that three pentagons could all touch one another, and there are just too many edges to fill in the rest of the polyhedron with only three more faces).

The arguments we used (which I have not written rigorously here) rely on a lot of case analysis.",,"['geometry', 'polyhedra', 'convex-geometry', 'combinatorial-geometry']"
99,History of the power of a point with respect to a circle,History of the power of a point with respect to a circle,,"There is a concept of a ""power of a point with respect to a circle"". If one has a point which is distance $d$ away from the centre of some circle and that circle has radius $r$ then the power of this point is said to be $d^2-r^2$. I am unable to find much about the history of this concept except that it originated somewhere in mid $19$th century. Does anybody know why this concept was useful and why it developed?","There is a concept of a ""power of a point with respect to a circle"".
