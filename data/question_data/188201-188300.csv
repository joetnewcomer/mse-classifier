I wanted to verify my approach for the problem. It goes like this: My Approach: There can be two cases: Let $n$ be even. Now it is evident that $2|n$ , $2|n+2$ and $2|n+4$ This means that $2^3|n(n+2)(n+4)$ Since we have $3$ consecutive even numbers. It is evident that either $4|(n+2)$ , or $4|n$ and $4|n+4$ Suppose $4|(n+2)$ , this means that there would be one more factor of $2$ than the initial number dividing the number, thus $2^4|n(n+2)(n+4)$ It is also evident that $3|n(n+2)(n+4)$ So now $n(n+2)(n+4)=2^4\cdot 3\cdot p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ This means that $\tau (n(n+2)(n+4))=5\times 2\times (a_1+1)\times (a_2+1)\times \cdots \times (a_r+1)$ . Observe that if any of the $a_i\geq 1$ , then $\tau (n(n+2)(n+4))\geq 5\times 2\times 2>15$ . $\therefore $ All $a_i=0$ . Thus $n(n+2)(n+4)=2^4\times 3=48=2\times 4\times 6$ , which means that $\boxed{n=2}$ Suppose $4|n$ and $4|n+4$ , and since we have two consecutive factors of 4, one of them must be divisible by $8$ . Thus there are $3$ additional factors of $2$ in $n(n+2)(n+4)$ . So $n(n+2)(n+4)=2^6\cdot 3\cdot p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ Now using the same argument as used in the previous case, we know that $a_i=0$ for all $i$ . $\therefore n(n+2)(n+4)=2^6\times 3=4\times 6\times 8$ which means that $\boxed{n=4}$ . Let $n$ be odd. Now $3|n(n+2)(n+4)$ . Also any two of them taken in pair are relatively prime. Let $n(n+2)(n+4)=(3\times k)\cdot p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_r^{a_r}\cdot q_1^{b_1}\cdot q_2^{b_2}\cdots q_s^{b_s}$ Now $k$ can be from the set $\{1, 3, 5,\ldots\}$ . Suppose $\tau (3k)\geq 4$ , then $\tau (n(n+2)(n+4))\geq 4(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots (a_r+1)(b_1+1)(b_2+1)\cdots (b_s+1)$ We need $4(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots (a_r+1)(b_1+1)(b_2+1)\cdots (b_s+1)\leq 15$ or $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots (a_r+1)(b_1+1)(b_2+1)\cdots (b_s+1)\leq 3$ . But there would be at least one $a_i>1$ and $b_i>1$ because the numbers not divisible by three are greater than 1. Thus $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\ldots (a_r+1)(b_1+1)(b_2+1)\cdots (b_s+1)\geq 4$ which is contradictory. $\therefore \tau (3k)\leq 3$ . Now if $3\not | k$ and $k\neq 1$ , then it is evident that $\tau (3k)\geq 4$ which doesn't satisfy our conditions. $\therefore 3|k$ . Since $\tau(3k)\leq 3$ , the only possible values for $k$ are ${1,3}$ or $3k=3$ or $3k=9$ . Which means the triplets can be $(1,3,5), (3,5,7), (5,7,9), (7,9,11)$ and $(9,11,13)$ . This means that $\boxed{n=1,3,5,7,9}$ Considering both the cases together, we get $\boxed{n=1,2,3,4,5,7,9}$ Please check my approach for any mistakes.

97,For which type of input does this operation repeat the outcome eventually and run forever?,For which type of input does this operation repeat the outcome eventually and run forever?,,"This problem is a part of another (programming) problem on which I am working, the start of which requires us to identify a certain pattern, I believe. We are given a pair of positive integers x and y. We are going to perform an operation on this pair repeatedly to obtain a pair with equal values. We could as well say that this operation tries to balance this pair of integers so as to make them equal. The balancing operation is as follows: If the pair has unequal values, take the minimum, add it to the smaller integer and subtract it from the larger one. If the pair still has unequal values, repeat this operation on the new values. The task is to find whether this operation will run forever or eventually stop(making the values equal)? Can this be determined by seeing the initial input itself? Hint for remembering the operation easily : The smaller one gets doubled, the larger one diminishes by value equal to the smaller one. See examples below. Example: Start with (1, 4). We see that (1, 4) --> (2, 3) --> (4, 1) --> (3, 2) --> (1, 4). At this point it is clear that this operation will not give equal values for the pair(1, 4).
