Proof for theorem : By the above lemma, we can write $$\left(\begin{matrix}         I_2  \\         I_3 \\         I_4  \\         \end{matrix} \right)=\left(\begin{matrix}         -\frac{1}{24} & \frac{3}{16} & 0 \\         -\frac{1}{64} & \frac{9}{64} & -\frac{93}{128} \\         -\frac{1}{160} & \frac{3}{32} & -\frac{45}{64} \\         \end{matrix} \right)\left(\begin{matrix}         \log 2  \\         {\zeta (3)}/{{\pi}^2} \\         {\zeta(5)}/{{\pi}^4}  \\         \end{matrix} \right)$$ Hence, we get $$\frac{\zeta(3)}{{\pi}^2}=-\frac 13(1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2),$$ $$\frac{\zeta(5)}{{\pi}^4}=-\frac 13(120I_4-112I_3+24I_2).$$ Hence, since $\zeta(2)={{\pi}^2}/{6}$, we get $$\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}=6\frac{{\zeta(5)}/{{\pi}^4}}{{\zeta(3)}/{{\pi}^2}}=6\frac{120I_4-112I_3+24I_2}{1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2}.$$ Now if $\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}$ is a rational number, then there exist natural numbers $r,s$ such that  $$\frac{120I_4-112I_3+24I_2}{1240I_4-1200I_3+264I_2}=\frac sr.$$ Hence, we get $$(120r-1240s)I_4-(112r-1200s)I_3+(24r-264s)I_2=0$$ $$\Rightarrow 120r-1240s=112r-1200s=24r-264s=0$$ $$\Rightarrow 3r=31s,\ 7r=75s,\ r=11s.$$ However, there don't exist such $r,s$. Hence, we know that $\frac{\zeta(5)}{\zeta(2)\zeta(3)}$ is an irrational number. Now the proof for theorem is completed. Update : I crossposted to MO .",,['integration']

My attempt My first idea was to integrate by parts using $f=\tan^{-1}{x}$ and $dg=\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{e^{ax}-1}$, with the hope that the resulting integral would be amenable to solution by differentiating under the integral sign.

When $n=1,$ we have $$I(1)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This can be easily shown to be zero by performing the substitution $x=1/y,$ which will yield $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=-\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ Thus, $I(1)=0.$ Clearly, this can be generalized to all odd integers, and $I(2n+1)=0.$ In the case of $n=2$, first observe through the same substitution as above that $$\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_1^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This implies that $$I(2)=2\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,$$ which is an easier integral to work with. Performing the substitution $x=e^{-y}$ yields $$I(2)=2\int_0^\infty y^2\left(e^{-y}-e^{-3y}+e^{-5y}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)\,\mathrm{d}y.$$ Using the identity $$\int_0^\infty x^2 e^{-ax}=\frac{2}{a^3},$$ we obtain $$I(2)=4\left(\frac{1}{1^3}-\frac{1}{3^3}+\frac{1}{5^3}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)=4\cdot\frac{\pi^3}{32}=\frac{\pi^3}{8}.$$ I'm not sure how this infinite series is evaluated, but I found this result in a book. I used Mathematica to check a few more values, and I found that $I(4)=5\pi/32,\,I(6)=61\pi/128,\,$ and $I(8)=1385\pi/512.$ Clearly the pattern is $$I(2n)=A_{2n}\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2n+1},$$ where $A_{2n}$ is some constant. It turns out that these constants are the Euler numbers, which are the coefficients $E_k$ corresponding to the series $$\operatorname{sech}x=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{E_k}{k!}x^k.$$ All Euler numbers corresponding to odd $n$ are zero, and the first few even Euler numbers are $E_0=1,\, E_2=-1,\, E_4=5, \,E_6=-61,\,$ and $E_8=1385.$ Thus, I have conjectured that $$I(2n)=(-1)^n E_{2n} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{2n+1}$$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+.$ I suppose this could be extended to $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ thusly: $$I(n)=i^n E_n \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{n+1},$$ since $E_n=0$ for odd $n.$ So the question, of course, is how to prove this. I tried generalizing the method I used for $I(2),$ and I found that $$\int_0^\infty x^n e^{-ax}=\frac{n!}{a^{n+1}},\,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}.$$ Using this, I obtained $$I(2n)=n!\left(\frac{1}{1^{n+1}}-\frac{1}{3^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{5^{n+1}}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)=n!\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^{n+1}}.$$ Mathematica wasn't able to evaluate this sum, even for the case of $n=2.$ It gives some expression involving multiple zeta functions, with which I have no experience. Even if we can't prove this, I would be interested to know why the Euler numbers might appear here. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Edit : As Claude Leibovici helped point out, there final series expression should be $$I(2n)=2(2n)!\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)^{2n+1}}=\frac{(2n)!}{2^{4n+1}}\left[\zeta\left(2n+1, \frac{1}{4}\right)-\zeta\left(2n+1, \frac{3}{4}\right)\right].$$","I have been playing around a bit with integrals of the form $$I(n)=\int_0^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^n}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,\,\,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,$$ and I am trying to obtain a closed form solution for $I(n).$ I believe the special cases $I(1)$ and $I(2)$ are somewhat well-known, but I will go over them. When $n=1,$ we have $$I(1)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x+\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This can be easily shown to be zero by performing the substitution $x=1/y,$ which will yield $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=-\int_1^\infty \frac{\log{x}}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ Thus, $I(1)=0.$ Clearly, this can be generalized to all odd integers, and $I(2n+1)=0.$ In the case of $n=2$, first observe through the same substitution as above that $$\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_1^\infty \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x.$$ This implies that $$I(2)=2\int_0^1 \frac{(\log{x})^2}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x,$$ which is an easier integral to work with. Performing the substitution $x=e^{-y}$ yields $$I(2)=2\int_0^\infty y^2\left(e^{-y}-e^{-3y}+e^{-5y}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)\,\mathrm{d}y.$$ Using the identity $$\int_0^\infty x^2 e^{-ax}=\frac{2}{a^3},$$ we obtain $$I(2)=4\left(\frac{1}{1^3}-\frac{1}{3^3}+\frac{1}{5^3}-\cdot\cdot\cdot\right)=4\cdot\frac{\pi^3}{32}=\frac{\pi^3}{8}.$$ I'm not sure how this infinite series is evaluated, but I found this result in a book.

Introduction: For a more general discussion the representation of the Meijer G-functions through their generalizations - the Fox H - Functions - Mathai are needed: \begin{align*} \mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}\, = \mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}\, =  H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( \tag{2}\label{eq:2}1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_1,A_1\right) ,\left(a_2,A_2\right) ,\left(a_3,A_3\right) \\  \left(b_1,B_1\right) ,\left(b_2,B_2\right) ,\left(b_3,B_3\right) \end{array}\right. \right)  \,\text{and}\qquad  \end{align*} \begin{align*} \mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}\, = \mathcal{G_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}\, =  H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_1,A_1\right) ,\left(a_2,A_2\right) ,\left(a_3,A_3\right) \\  \left(b_1,B_1\right) ,\left(b_2,B_2\right) ,\left(b_3 + 1,B_3\right) \end{array}\right. \right)\text{,} \end{align*} where we used the following coefficients and indices: \begin{align*} \left(a_1,A_1\right) = \left(\frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2},\mathscr{n}\right),\, \left(a_n,A_n\right) = \left(a_2,A_2\right) = \left(0,1\right) \end{align*} \begin{align*} \left(a_p,A_p\right) = \left(a_{n+1},A_{n+1}\right) = \left(a_ 3,A_3\right) = \left(1,1\right) \end{align*} \begin{align*} \left(b_1,B_1\right) = \left(0,1\right),\, \left(b_2,B_2\right) = \left(0,1\right) \end{align*} \begin{align*} \left(b_q,B_q\right) = \left(b_m,B_m\right) = \left(b_3,B_3\right) = \left(a_1,A_1\right)  = \left(\frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2},\mathscr{n}\right) \end{align*} \begin{align*} m = 3,\, n = 2,\, p = 3,\, q = 3 \end{align*} Motivation: The identity is a special case of a more general solution of the integral Vladimir Reshetnikov \begin{align} \int_{0}^\infty\operatorname{sech}(x)\operatorname{sech}(a\, x)\ dx\,=\,\left( 1-\frac{1}{\mathscr{n}}\right)\,\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{a})}\,+\, \frac{2}{\mathscr{n}}\,\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{a})}\tag{3}\label{eq:3}\\ \end{align} \begin{align*} =\left( 1-\frac{1}{\mathscr{n}}\right)\,H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_1,A_1\right) ,\left(a_2,A_2\right) ,\left(a_3,A_3\right) \\  \left(b_1,B_1\right) ,\left(b_2,B_2\right) ,\left(b_3,B_3\right) \end{array}\right. \right)\,+ \end{align*} \begin{align*} +\,\frac{2}{\mathscr{n}}\, H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_1,A_1\right) ,\left(a_2,A_2\right) ,\left(a_3,A_3\right) \\  \left(b_1,B_1\right) ,\left(b_2,B_2\right) ,\left(b_3 + 1,B_3\right) \end{array}\right. \right) \end{align*} Besides of the identity \eqref{eq:1}, which is subject of this post, other interesting unknown identities arise from the discussion in stocha and especially the interesting answer Somos . An asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ may also give more insight in the approximations of Claude Leibovici . Moreover the study of the Mellin transformation of $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ is a valuable replenishment to the paper ""Evaluation of a class of definite integrals"" by M.L. Glasser (Univ. Beograd. Publ. Elektrotehn. Fak. Ser. Mat. Fiz.76,498-No.541(1975), 49-50.) Since the argument of the Fox H-functions are equal to 1, we can use Mathai and write $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in different forms: \begin{align*} \mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert \tag{4}\label{eq:4} \begin{array}{c} \left(a_p,A_p\right)  \\  \left(b_q,B_q\right) \end{array}\right. \right) = H_{3,3}^{2,3}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(1-b_q,B_q\right)  \\  \left(1-a_p,A_p\right) \end{array}\right. \right) = \frac{1}{k} \,H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_p,\frac{A_p}{k}\right)  \\  \left(b_q,\frac{B_q}{k}\right) \end{array}\right. \right)\,\text{and}\qquad  \end{align*} \begin{align*} \mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})} = H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_p,A_p\right)  \\  \left(b_q + 1,B_q\right) \end{array}\right. \right) = H_{3,3}^{2,3}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(1-b_q + 1,B_q\right)  \\  \left(1-a_p,A_p\right) \end{array}\right. \right) \end{align*} \begin{align*} = \frac{1}{k} \,H_{3,3}^{3,2}\left( 1\left\vert  \begin{array}{c} \left(a_p,\frac{A_p}{k}\right)  \\  \left(b_q + 1,\frac{B_q}{k}\right) \end{array}\right. \right) \end{align*} where $k > 0$ Attempt at a solution: For the prove we followed two ways: The first way is to express the Fox H - Functions $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ and $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in serial representation Mathai , take advantage of the fact, that the poles of $\Gamma \left(1-a_j+s A_j\right)$ at least for $\mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})}$ are simple and receive an infinite sum: \begin{align} \mathcal{H_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = (-1)^{\frac{\mathscr{n}}{2}} \,\pi \,\log\left(2\right) + \frac{1}{\mathscr{n}}\,\sum _{\nu =0}^{\infty } (-1)^{\nu } \,\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{\mathscr{n} - 2\,\nu -1}{2\,\mathscr{n} }\right) \Gamma\left(1 + \nu\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{1 + \mathscr{n} + 2\,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)^2}{\nu ! \,\Gamma\left(\frac{1 + 3 \,\mathscr{n} + 2 \,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)}  \tag{5}\label{eq:5}  \end{align} \begin{align*} = (-1)^{\frac{\mathscr{n}}{2}} \,\pi \,\log\left(2\right) + 2 \pi \, \sum _{\nu =0}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^{\nu }\, \sec\left(\pi\,\frac{1+2\,\nu }{2\, \mathscr{n} }\right)}{1 + \mathscr{n} + 2 \,\nu }  \end{align*} It turned out, that the equivalent sum for $\mathcal{H_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ in contrast do not converge. Therefore we use the series representations of the Meijer G function Mathematical Functions Site , which do converge: \begin{align} \mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = \sum _{k=1}^{\mathscr{n}+1} \frac{\left(\left(\prod _{j=1,j\neq k}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \Gamma \left(a_k-a_j\right)\right) \prod _{j=1}^{\mathscr{n}+2} \Gamma\left(1+b_j-a_k\right)\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+a_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right)}\,_{\mathscr{n}+2}F_{\mathscr{n}+1}(\left\{1+b_{1}-a_k,\ldots ,1+b_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right\},  \tag{6}\label{eq:6} \end{align} \begin{align*} \left\{1+a_1-a_k,\ldots ,1+a_{k-1}-a_k,1+a_{k+1}-a_k,\ldots,1+a_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right\},-1)\\ \end{align*} Note that $b_{1} = b_{2}=0$ , $a_{\mathscr{n}+1} = 0$ , $a_{\mathscr{n}+2} = 1$ , $a_j = b_{j+2},\,j = 1,\ldots,n$ and \begin{align} \frac{{\Gamma\left(1-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)}^2}{\Gamma\left(2-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)} = \frac{\Gamma\left(2-a_{\mathscr{n}+1}\right)}{{\left(a_{\mathscr{n}+1}-1\right)}^2}\tag{7}\label{eq:7}\\ \end{align} \begin{align} \mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} =  \sum _{k=1}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \left(\left(\prod _{j=1,j\neq k}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \Gamma \left(a_k-a_j\right)\right) \prod _{j=1}^{\mathscr{n}} \Gamma\left(1+a_j-a_k\right)\right)\frac{\Gamma\left(2-a_{k}\right)}{{\left(a_{k}-1\right)}^2} \tag{8}\label{eq:8}\\ \end{align} \begin{align*}  \,_{\mathscr{n}+2}F_{\mathscr{n}+1}(\left\{1-a_k,1-a_k,1+a_{1}-a_k,\ldots ,1+a_{\mathscr{n}}-a_k\right\}, \end{align*} \begin{align*}  \left\{1+a_1-a_k,\ldots ,1+a_{k-1}-a_k,1+a_{k+1}-a_k,\ldots,1+a_{\mathscr{n}+2}-a_k\right\},-1)\\ \end{align*} \begin{align} \mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = \sum _{k=1}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \left(\left(\prod _{j=1,j\neq k}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \Gamma \left(a_k-a_j\right)\right) \prod _{j=1}^{\mathscr{n}} \Gamma\left(1+a_j-a_k\right)\right)\frac{\Gamma\left(2-a_{k}\right)}{{\left(a_{k}-1\right)}^2} \tag{9}\label{eq:9} \end{align} \begin{align*}  \,_{3}F_{2}(\left\{1,1-a_k,1-a_k\right\},\left\{1-a_k,2-a_k\right\},-1)\\ \end{align*} \begin{align} \mathcal{G_\texttt{1}(\mathscr{n})} = \frac{1}{2}\,\sum _{k=1}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \left(\left(\prod _{j=1,j\neq k}^{\mathscr{n}+1}  \Gamma \left(a_k-a_j\right)\right) \prod _{j=1}^{\mathscr{n}} \Gamma\left(1+a_j-a_k\right)\right)\frac{\Gamma\left(2-a_{k}\right)}{\left(a_{k}-1\right)}\,\left(\psi\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{a_k}{2}\right)-\psi\left(1-\frac{a_k}{2}\right)\right) \tag{10}\label{eq:10}\\ \end{align} Note that $a_{\mathscr{n}+1} = 0$ . For further simplifications we have to express the coefficients $a_k$ and $a_j$ as function of $\mathscr{n}$ \begin{align} a_j\left(\mathscr{n}\right) = \frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2 \mathscr{n}}+\frac{j-1}{\mathscr{n}}\quad a_k\left(\mathscr{n}\right) = \frac{1-\mathscr{n}}{2 \mathscr{n}}+\frac{k-1}{\mathscr{n}} \tag{11}\label{eq:11} \end{align} The second product in \eqref{eq:6} is done with the duplication formula Wikipedia \begin{align} \prod _{j=1}^\mathscr{n} \Gamma\left(1+a_j-a_k\right)=\prod_{j=0}^{\mathscr{n}-1} \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{k-1}{\mathscr{n}} + \frac{j}{\mathscr{n}}\right)=(2 \pi )^{\frac{\mathscr{n}-1}{2}}\mathscr{n}^{\frac{1}{2}-(\mathscr{n}-(k-1))} \,\Gamma\left(\mathscr{n}-(k-1)\right) \tag{12}\label{eq:12} \end{align} The simplification of the first product in \eqref{eq:6} seems to be very difficult, since the sign in the gamma function for some coefficients is negative.  The same derivations have to be done similar for $\mathcal{G_\texttt{2}(\mathscr{n})}$ . We find a definite sum over $\mathscr{n}$ as expected, but make no progress at this point at all.

60,Rigorous treatment of integration by parts in a Calculus 1 course,Rigorous treatment of integration by parts in a Calculus 1 course,,"I will be teaching Calculus 1 soon and I am trying to find some justifications for fishy arguments that are widespread out there. In a standard Calculus 1 course, the following concepts are presented to students. Antiderivative: A function $F$ is called an antiderivative of a function $f$ in an interval if $F'=f$ in that interval. Indefinite integral: the family of all the antiderivatives of a function $f$ is called indefinite integral of $f$ and is denoted by $\int f(x)dx$ . Having shown that the difference of any two antiderivatives of the same function is constant, if $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ , then we write $\int f(x)dx=F(x)+C$ , where $C$ is a constant. The problem I see is that some textbooks define the differential in a very vague manner and then foster the use of the equality $dy=y'dx$ without justification. For example, when presenting the integration by parts all starts fine with the product rule of two differentiable functions $u$ and $v$ : $$(uv)'=u'v+uv'\implies uv'=(uv)'-u'v$$ which implies that $$\int u(x)v'(x)dx=u(x)v(x)-\int u'(x)v(x)dx\quad\quad\quad (A)$$ The problem starts with the manipulation of the dummy symbols in the notation of the indefinite integral by the substitutions $dv=v'(x)dx$ and $du=u'(x)dx$ resulting in the popular formula: $$\int udv=uv-\int vdu\quad\quad\quad (B)$$ When I look at the definition of indefinite integral, equality (A) is well-defined but (B) is not. Into practice: Calculate $\int 2x\cos(x)dx$ . A student using (A) will write: let $u(x)=2x$ and $v'(x)=\cos(x)$ . Then $u'(x)=2$ and $v(x)=\int cos(x)dx=\sin(x)$ (here undertanding that we just need 1 (any) antiderivative) Then by (A) we have: $\int 2x\cos(x)dx=2x\sin(x)-\int 2\sin(x)dx=2x\sin(x)+2\cos(x)+C$ . When using (B) students use $u=2x$ and $dv=\cos(x)dx$ . Then compute $du=2dx$ and $v=\sin(x)$ , and finally replace the pieces into (B) as if they were TeX processors. I mean, the method relies on the syntax of (B), not in the definition of indefinite integral. Question: what is the mathematical justification to accept the use of (B)? The justification should be at the level of students taking Calculus 1. Remark: Note that substitutions of the type $dy=y'dx$ are not necessary for the substitution techniques of integration in a Calculus 1 course. Indeed, if $F'=f$ , then the chain rule shows: $$(F\circ g)'(x)=f(g(x))g'(x)$$ so by the definition of indefinite integral $$\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx=F(g(x))+C,$$ or equivalently, $$\int f(g(x))g'(x)dx=\left.\int f(u)du\right|_{u=g(x)}.$$ Update: Thanks to the answers posted, I realized that my concern was justified: (B) is (apparently) only justified after considering contents that are not part of a calculus 1 course, say, through Stieltjes integrals or differentials. Thank you for the well-presented answers and for the comments and resources presented in the comment sections. I am well aware that it would not be good to hide (B) from my students since as it was pointed out in the comments, students will face it sooner or later and they should be prepared for it. That is why I posted this question. I think I will present and mostly use (A) during the course. I will mention (B) stating that is true but we do not have the tools to prove it and that for now it can be used as a notation-wise shortcut for (A), so they have a way to justify steps that appear in many calculus textbooks, steps that are layout without a proper justification (and you wonder why people do not understand mathematics).","I will be teaching Calculus 1 soon and I am trying to find some justifications for fishy arguments that are widespread out there.

84,Why Mathematicians and Physicists Approach Integration on Manifolds Differently?,Why Mathematicians and Physicists Approach Integration on Manifolds Differently?,,"I have been attempting to find an answer to this for a few weeks, and decided to finally ask. I'll ask the questions at the beginning and then give the necessary background below: (1) Are volume forms $dx^1\wedge\ldots\wedge dx^n$ $n$ -forms and tensors? (2) How do I integrate on Lorentzian manifolds? (3) Is some pull-back on a manifold related to the metric of that manifold? I'm a novice to general relativity, and I am teaching myself through Sean Carroll's An Introduction to General Relativity: Spacetime and Geometry (see here for essentially a pre-print version). Simultaneously, I am looking at Jon Pierre Fortney's A Visual Introduction to Differential Forms and Calculus on Manifolds in order to try to understand the mathematical infrastructure of GR in a somewhat visual way. I am very much confused by how the two authors handle integration on manifolds. I understand that Fortney is trying to deal with somewhat more primitive analysis using $\mathbb{R}^n$ manifolds, while Carroll tries to deal more specifically with Lorentzian manifolds, but there is no indication in the text of either that the formulas derived for integration are not general. Carroll (in 89-90 of his book; or page 53-54 of the linked pre-print) argues that volume forms $d^n x=dx^0\wedge\ldots\wedge dx^{n-1}$ are not tensors, i.e. they are not an $n$ -forms. He then goes through to sort of prove that the proper, coordinate-invariant method of integration of a scalar function $\phi$ on a (Lorentzian??) manifold is given by: $I=\int \phi(x) \sqrt{|g|}d^nx$ , where $|g|$ is the determinate of the metric on the manifold. Fortney (in chapter 3 and Appendix A) indicates that forms such as $dx^i \wedge dx^j$ are $n$ -forms and are a subset of all tensors on a manifold (specifically, the set of skew-symmetric ( $n$ ,0) tensors). In Chapter 7, he derives the integration formula for integration under coordinate change $\theta: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ as: $\int_R f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) dx^1\wedge \ldots \wedge dx^n = \int_{\phi(R)} f\circ\theta^{-1}(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n)T^*\theta^{-1}\cdot(dx^1 \wedge\ldots \wedge dx^n)$ , where $[\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n]$ are the transformed coordinates and $T^*\theta^{-1}$ is the pullback induced by $\theta$ on $T^*$ . I realize, in a very real sense, these expressions are addressing two different aspects of integration. In particular, Fortney is specifically interested in change in coordinates while Carroll is interested in a coordinate-invariant expression for integration. However, I can't help but think these ideas should be related. In particular, it seems like the pull-back of some transformation is related to the metric on the manifold. I'm particularly concerned by the discrepancy between Carrol and Fortney. Carroll argues volume forms are not tensors, while Fortney argues they are. Either one of them is wrong or I'm misunderstanding the objects they are talking about.","I have been attempting to find an answer to this for a few weeks, and decided to finally ask.

Simultaneously, I am looking at Jon Pierre Fortney's A Visual Introduction to Differential Forms and Calculus on Manifolds in order to try to understand the mathematical infrastructure of GR in a somewhat visual way. I am very much confused by how the two authors handle integration on manifolds. I understand that Fortney is trying to deal with somewhat more primitive analysis using manifolds, while Carroll tries to deal more specifically with Lorentzian manifolds, but there is no indication in the text of either that the formulas derived for integration are not general. Carroll (in 89-90 of his book; or page 53-54 of the linked pre-print) argues that volume forms are not tensors, i.e. they are not an -forms. He then goes through to sort of prove that the proper, coordinate-invariant method of integration of a scalar function on a (Lorentzian??) manifold is given by: , where is the determinate of the metric on the manifold. Fortney (in chapter 3 and Appendix A) indicates that forms such as are -forms and are a subset of all tensors on a manifold (specifically, the set of skew-symmetric ( ,0) tensors). In Chapter 7, he derives the integration formula for integration under coordinate change as: , where are the transformed coordinates and is the pullback induced by on . I realize, in a very real sense, these expressions are addressing two different aspects of integration. In particular, Fortney is specifically interested in change in coordinates while Carroll is interested in a coordinate-invariant expression for integration. However, I can't help but think these ideas should be related. In particular, it seems like the pull-back of some transformation is related to the metric on the manifold. I'm particularly concerned by the discrepancy between Carrol and Fortney. Carroll argues volume forms are not tensors, while Fortney argues they are. Either one of them is wrong or I'm misunderstanding the objects they are talking about.","dx^1\wedge\ldots\wedge dx^n n \mathbb{R}^n d^n x=dx^0\wedge\ldots\wedge dx^{n-1} n \phi I=\int \phi(x) \sqrt{|g|}d^nx |g| dx^i \wedge dx^j n n \theta: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \int_R f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) dx^1\wedge \ldots \wedge dx^n = \int_{\phi(R)} f\circ\theta^{-1}(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n)T^*\theta^{-1}\cdot(dx^1 \wedge\ldots \wedge dx^n) [\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n] T^*\theta^{-1} \theta T^*","['integration', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'general-relativity']"
85,Nontrivial trivial integrals,Nontrivial trivial integrals,,"Consider two propositions in geometry: Circumscribe a right circular cylinder about a sphere.  The surface area of the cylinder between any two planes orthogonal to the cylinder's axis equals the surface area of the sphere between those two planes.  (Archimedes showed this.) Let a curve running from the south pole to the north pole on a perfectly spherical earth meet every meridian of longitude at the same angle $\gamma$.  Then the length of the curve is proportional to $\sec\gamma$.  (In particular, it's infinite if $\gamma$ is a right angle, and one could even go beyond a right angle and consider it an oriented length, so that the oriented length is negative if the curve goes from the north pole to the south pole.  In that case, the infinite length would be the $\infty$ that's at both ends of the real line rather than $+\infty$ or $-\infty$, so the length depends continuously on $\gamma$.) Both propositions admit the same kind of proof: For the first, consider what happens when the distance between the two planes is infinitesimal; then show that if it works then, then it also works for larger-than-infinitesimal distances.  For the second, show that the length of an infinitesimal increment of the curve is $\sec\gamma$ times the latitude-component of the distance, just by drawing an infinitesimal right triangle. You might think that in both cases one is finding an integral, but it's an integral of a constant: just the constant itself times the length of the interval over which one integrates.  So it's as if you don't need to know about integrals and you certainly don't need to find any antiderivatives, but the method of proof doesn't work for larger-than-infinitesimal quantities. One would like to say things like ""energy is force times distance; it is only when the force is not constant that one must use integrals and multiply the force at an instant by the infinitesimal distance and then integrate"".  But if proving the force is constant itself requires an infinitesimal viewpoint, then despite the triviality of computing the integral by multiplying two numbers, it seems necessary to the logic of the argument to view it as an integral. So: What other instances besides these two are known?  (I suspect there are many in geometry.)
