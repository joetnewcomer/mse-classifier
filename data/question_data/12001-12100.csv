4,Are functions still continuous even with removable discontinuities?,Are functions still continuous even with removable discontinuities?,,"If we define a continuous function as a function that is continuous at all points in its domain, then would a removable discontinuity not impact this? For example consider the function $f(x) = x$. It is clearly continuous at every point in its domain, which is all real numbers.

The domain is now something like $(-\infty, 2) \cup (2, \infty)$. Continuity at a point usually means the limits exist and they equal the function's value at that point. The number $2$ is not in the domain so we only have to consider numbers to the left and to the right of $2$, and no matter what number we pick, they will be defined and have limits equaling those values.

If we can prove that is monotonic, then we are done. Let $b_n = a_n/n$ . Then, we have $$ \dfrac{b_{n+1} }{b_n} = \dfrac{n}{n+1} \cdot \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} > \dfrac{n}{n+1} $$ Which leads nowhere.

Let $$I(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(e^x-1)^n} -\frac {1}{\left(\frac {x}{1!}+\frac {x^2}{2!}+\frac {x^3}{3!}+\cdots +\frac {x^n}{n!}\right)^n}\right) $$ Evaluate $I(n)$ in terms of $n$ . Now I tried a lot of messing ups with this monster.  Tried L'Hospital,  Squeeze theorem, Stolz-Cesaro,  Binomial theorem and Multinomial theorem,  etc.  But couldn't reach the general form. On writing out few terms using Wolfy I get $I(1)=\frac {-1}{2}$ , $I(2)=\frac {-1}{3}$ , $I(3)=\frac {-1}{8}$ , $I(4)=\frac {-1}{30}$ and so on On spending some time on these observations I could conjecture that $$I(n)=\frac {-n}{(n+1)!}$$ and tried this formula to check whether it was consistent with other values of $n$ and it indeed was.  So Now I have the general form but no proof to it. And something which is quite interesting in this question is that the first fraction has a denominator with a function raised to power $n$ while the denominator of second fraction is nothing but the Maclaurin expansion of that function with finite terms (here $n$ terms)  raised to power of $n$ . So I tried to test it with some other functions and the results impressed me a lot. 1) $$J(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(\ln (1+x))^n} -\frac {1}{\left(x-\frac {x^2}{2}+\frac {x^3}{3}-\cdots +\frac {(-1)^{n+1} x^n}{n}\right)^n}\right) =\frac {(-1)^{n+1}n}{n+1}$$ 2) $$G(n)=\lim_{x\to 0} \left(\frac {1}{(\arccos x-\frac {\pi}{2})^n} -\frac {1}{\left(\underbrace{\frac {x}{1}+\frac {x^3}{6}+\frac {3x^5}{40}+\frac {5x^7}{112}+\cdots}_{\text {n terms}}\right)^n}\right) $$ Now this limit is more interesting because it equals $0$ for all even natural $n$ and it doesn't exist for any odd natural $n$ Now what I actually want is a proper method to solve such problems.

65,Prove that $\arctan x$ cannot be expressed as a rational function,Prove that  cannot be expressed as a rational function,\arctan x,"In my Calculus class the teacher proposed as an exercise to prove that $\arctan(x)$ cannot be expressed as a rational function (fraction of polynomials) in any closed interval $[a,b]$ . I've been thinking on the problem and I haven't been able to prove it by ""analysis"" arguments but using some concepts of an abstract algebra course I took last semester. I've done it this way: Suppose there exist $p(x),q(x)$ such that $\arctan(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ in the interval $[a,b]$ , where $\gcd(p,q)=1$ . Thus, $\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)' = \frac{1}{1+x^2}$ . If we expand the expression of the derivative of a quotient and manipulate the equality, we end up with: $$(1+x^2)(p'(x)q(x)-p(x)q'(x))=q^2(x)$$ Thus, $1+x^2$ divides $q^2(x)$ and as $1+x^2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb R[x]$ , $1+x^2$ divides $q(x)$ . Let $q(x)$ have the prime factor $1+x^2$ ""n"" times. From the equation above, we know that $q^2(x)$ has the factor $(1+x^2)$ ""2n"" times; hence $(p'(x)q(x)-p(x)q'(x))$ has the factor $1+x^2$ exactly ""2n-1"" times. Note that for $n\geq 1$ , $2n-1 \geq n$ . Hence, the factor $(1+x^2)^n$ must divide $(p'(x)q(x)-p(x)q'(x))$ and it also divides $q(x)$ ; thus $(1+x^2)^n$ must divide $p(x)q'(x)$ . Suppose that $1+x^2$ is not a factor of $p(x)$ . Thus, $(1+x^2)^n$ must divide $q'(x)$ . However, note that: $$ q'(x) = ((x^2+1)^n \cdot r(x))' = 2nx(x^2 + 1)^{n-1} r(x) + (x^2+1)^n r'(x),\  \gcd(r,1+x^2)=1 $$ Therefore, $(x^2+1)^n$ divides $q'(x)$ if and only if $(x^2+1)^n$ divides $n(x^2+1)^{n-1} r(x)$ . Then, $x^2 + 1$ must divide $r(x)$ which is a contradiction. Hence, $x^2 +1$ must also be a factor of $p(x)$ . However, by hypothesis $\gcd(p,q)=1$ while $x^2+1$ divides both $p,q$ . This is a contradiction, hence there do not exist such polynomials. First of all, I would appreciate if anyone could tell me if this proof has any error. Moreover, I would appreciate any other approach which uses theorems of elementary one-variable calculus instead of divisibility. NOTE: In the case of $\mathbb R$ , this problem is (almost) trivial. As the arctangent has a horizontal asymptote in both $\pm \infty$ , it follows that if $\arctan(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$ for certain $p,q$ , they must verify that $deg(p) = deg (q)$ . Moreover, $x=0$ is a unique real root of $p(x)$ with multiplicity 1 as $\arctan(0) = p(0)/q(0) = 0$ and $\arctan(0)' = 1/(1+0^2) = 1 \not = 0$ . Thus, $deg(p)$ must be odd. However, all the roots of $q(x)$ are complex as $\arctan(x)$ must be continuous on $\mathbb R$ . As complex roots on a real polynomial come in conjugate pairs, it follows that $deg(q)$ must be even. Then $deg(p) \not = deg(q)$ which is a contradiction. Conclusions: I have already proposed a solution to my Calculus professor based on some arguments given in this page and adding some details: Suppose there exist $p,q$ such that $\arctan(x) = p(x)/q(x)$ and $gcd(p,q)=1$ in the interval $[a,b]$ . Therefore, they must have the same derivative, hence: $$ (1+x^2)(p'q-pq') = q^2, \forall x \in [a,b]$$ As an equality of polynomials in an interval $[a,b], a<b$ must hold also in $\mathbb R$ , then if $q(x) /not = 0$ , the equality above holds. We are going to prove that q(x) has no real roots hence $p(x)/q(x)$ is continuous in $\mathbb R$ . Suppose $\alpha \in \mathbb R$ is a root of $q$ . As there are finitely many roots of $q(x)$ as is a non-zero polynomial, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for any point in $[\alpha - \delta,\alpha + \delta]$ except for $x= \alpha$ , the equality $(\arctan x)' - (\frac{p}{q})' = 0$ holds. Thus, there exists a constant $c \in \mathbb R$ such that $\frac{p}{q} = \arctan + c$ . Thus, $$ \lim_{x \to \alpha} \frac{p}{q} = \lim_{x \to \alpha} (\arctan (x) + c) = arctan(\alpha) + c $$ As arctan is a continuous function. Thus, $\alpha$ must be a root also of $p(x)$ (if not, $\lim_{x \to \alpha} \frac{p}{q} = \infty$ ). But as we suppose that $p,q$ are prime polynomials, this is a contradiction. Hence, there cannot exists any root of q(x). Hence, $p(x)/q(x)$ is continuous in $\mathbb R$ and the equality $(\arctan x)' = (\frac{p}{q})'$ holds in $\mathbb R$ . Therefore, in $\mathbb R$ , $\frac{p}{q} = \arctan x + c$ and in $[a,b]$ , $\arctan = \frac{p}{q}$ . Thus $c = 0$ , and we get that $\forall x \in \mathbb, \arctan = \frac{p}{q}$ . But we have already proved that this is a contradiction, as desired. Further Questions: The same procedure can be used to prove that $log x$ cannot be expressed as a rational function. Moreover, I have come up with two questions I would try to solve: Can the argument applied here be generalised to an arbitrary function under certain hypothesis ( $f$ continuous and $f'$ a rational function, for example)? Can we find a similar argument to prove that $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ cannot be expressed in any interval as a rational function?
