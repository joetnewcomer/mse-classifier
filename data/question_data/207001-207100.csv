Since 7 balls must immediately go to Lucky, there are 23 balls left to distribute. There are 3 'bars', so the total number of possible combinations is $\binom{26}{3}$. Because this number accounts for the situations where Alice and Eve have $ \geq 21$ balls, I must subtract those out. (Here is where I think I messed something up).

If we assume that the middle field not are allowed to have the same colour as the top or bottom field, how many colours do we at least need to be sure that we can ensure that all $250$ countries have different flags. My attempt at a solution: If the number of colours are $f$, then the top field can consist of $f$ different colours, the middle field $f-1$ and the bottom field $f-1$. Hence, in total $f(f-1)^2$ colours.  We have that  $f(f-1)^2 > (f-1)^3$ and because $5^3 < 250 < 6^3$ we can be sure if $f -1 = 6$, i.e. $f=7$.",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I want to show that there are at least $2$ nodes $x,y \in V$ such that $G, G-x$ and $G-y$ have the same number of connected components. Now, since $G$ is in itself a connected graph, it has exactly $1$ connected component. So if the statement is true, it must be that $G-x$ and $G-y$ also have only one connected component, so they are connected. But I'm having trouble proving it, and also it seems to defy logic. If it really does turn out that in ANY connected graph there are $2$ nodes that I can remove and still get a connected graph, I would be very surprised.",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory']"

Let n > 2 be а positive integer. How many bit strings of length n are there with exactly two zeroes? Work: Part A is relatively simple. Since a bit consists of either the number 1 or 0, there are only two ways that the first slot can be filled or ${2^n}$ ways. Since there are eight bits, the answer would be ${2^8}$ or 256 . Part B is also relatively simple. There are a number of ways to solve this one. One way is to realize that is that you can fill up seven slots with two zeros, then 6 and so on (7 + 6 + 5....+ n-1). The end result is 28 . Part C to me is a little bit tricky. Part C is almost the same as part B but it's asking about ${n}$ strings. So what I could do is expand my work from part B. The symbol ${n}$ represents the length of the bit string. So for example, if we have a 3 bit string, we have 3 slots to fill and 3! ways to fill each slot. 2! of those slots have to be filled with a zero.

So the problem is the same as asking how many ways can pass out 6 pencils to 5 people? Or am I looking at this wrong?",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'permutations']"
99,Euler's theorem: [3]^2014^2014 mod 98,Euler's theorem: [3]^2014^2014 mod 98,,"Calculate without a calculator: $$\left [ 3 \right ]^{2014^{2014}}\mod 98$$ I know I have to use Euler's Theorem. As a hint it says I might need to use the Chinese Remainder theorem too. I know how both of these work theoretically. For example I can calculate $5^{256} \mod 13$ with Euler's Theorem. But these large numbers throw me off, especially the double power of 2014. I started of like this for the Chinese Remainder: $$98 = 2*7^{2}\\ \left [3  \right ]^{2014^{2014}} \mod 2 \\ \left [3  \right ]^{2014^{2014}} \mod 49 \\$$ Now calculate both: $$\left [3  \right ]^{2014^{2014}\mod \phi_{(2)} = 2} \equiv  \left [3  \right ]^{0} \equiv 1  \mod 2$$ That was lucky. I fail at mod 49. Applying Euler's Theorem on 2014^2014 (since ([3]^2014)^2014 seems even more impossible) gives the following: $$\phi _{(49)} = 42\\ 2014 = 47*42+40\\ 2014^{2014} = 2014^{42^{47}}*2014^{40}\equiv 2014^{40} \mod 49$$ (That doesn't really work without a calculator either.) And what now, applying Euler's Theorem again doesn't work, and I can't do it in my head either. Is my approach right? Did I do something wrong? Please point me in the right direction. I'm also open to entirely different solutions.","Calculate without a calculator: $$\left [ 3 \right ]^{2014^{2014}}\mod 98$$ I know I have to use Euler's Theorem.
