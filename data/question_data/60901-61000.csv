After some thinking, I came to this: Hypothesis .

We could assume it's zero for more simplicity. Let us denote $s(a,b,\cdots,c)=(a+b+\cdots+c)^n-(a^n+b^n+\cdots+c^n).$ I have two examples: $$xy=\frac{s(x,y)}{2} \tag{$n=2$}$$ $$xyz=\frac{s(x,y,z)-\big(s(x,y)+s(y,z)+s(z,x)\big)}{6} \tag{$n=3$}$$ My scratchwork was getting tedious so I didn't finish the $n=4$ case.

51,"Potential solution to Sloane's ""Powers of 2"" problem?","Potential solution to Sloane's ""Powers of 2"" problem?",,"Neil Sloane gave a problem in a recent Numberphile video here . It seems like there's a solution. But Sloane said it's unsolved and very hard so maybe not. But I'll try to outline the idea for the solution and I'm hoping to know: would an approach along these lines work? The problem is to find four distinct integers, $a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that as many pair-wise sums as possible are powers of two. For instance $a,b,c,d=-1,3,5,11$ gives four such pair-wise sums $$-1+3=2\quad 3+5=8\quad -1+5=4\quad 5+11=16 $$ out of a possible six (the powers of two themselves don't need to be distinct). Sloane said four sums is the best if $a,b,c,d$ are bounded but that five sums (though highly suspected impossible) was not disproven for the unbounded case. Here's an approach that would seem to be capable of proving five sums impossible. Firstly, five sums would imply that some three of $a,b,c,d$ give powers of two for all pair-wise sums (since a graph on 4 elements with 5 distinct edges has at least one 3-clique). Without loss of generality we can suppose $$a+b=2^p\quad a+c=2^q\quad b+c=2^r$$ for non-negative integers $p,q,r\in\mathbb{N}$ . But this also gives us linear expressions for $a,b,$ and $c$ in terms of powers of two: $$2^p+2^q-2^r=2a\quad 2^p-2^q+2^r=2b\quad -2^p+2^q+2^r=2c$$ And we can divide through by $2$ getting $a,b,$ and $c$ alone $$a=2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}-2^{r-1}\quad b=2^{p-1}-2^{q-1}+2^{r-1}\quad c=-2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}+2^{r-1}$$ Any distinct choice of $p,q,r$ gives us three of the five desired pair-wise sums. To achieve five, we need $d$ to sum to a power of 2 with two of $a,b,$ and $c$ . Without loss of generality, say with $a$ and $b$ : $$a+d=2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}-2^{r-1}+d=2^m$$ $$b+d=2^{p-1}-2^{q-1}+2^{r-1}+d=2^n$$ And rearranging to get $d$ alone, we get an equality of powers of two: $$d=2^m-2^{p-1}-2^{q-1}+2^{r-1}=2^n-2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}-2^{r-1}$$ Cancelling terms (like $-2^{p-1}$ ) and rearranging again, we get $$2^m+2^r=2^n+2^q$$ This, of course, implies that $\{m,r\}=\{n,q\}$ . This is probably the jump in logic where this approach fails. The intuition is that we can think of a sum of powers of two like a binary number, with the exponents indicating the indices of the $1$ 's in the binary digit expansion of the number. So the aforementioned equation could be read as ""we have two equal binary numbers with two $1$ 's in each binary digit expansion"" -- wouldn't it follow that the $1$ 's have to be in the same positions in both such numbers? The analogy fails a bit if $m=r$ . But in that case, wouldn't it still be apt to determine the LHS as a binary number with a single $1$ digit? But even in that case $n=q=m=r$ is the only solution and we still have $\{m,r\}=\{n,q\}$ . Anyways, there are two ways to realize $\{m,r\}=\{n,q\}$ . Case 1 is that $m=n$ and $r=q$ . In this case, $a=b=2^{p-1}$ and thus our $a,b,c,d$ are not distinct. Case 2 is that $m=q$ and $r=n$ . In this case $d=-2^{p-1}+2^{q-1}+2^{r-1}=c$ and again our $a,b,c,d$ are not distinct. Thus the assumption that there exist distinct $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that five of their pairwise sums are powers of two was incorrect. Am I missing something? There's no way something Neil Sloane calls ""very hard"" has a solution this straight-forward right? He did talk about extending the problem to more than four integers; perhaps he meant they don't know the optimal in general? EDIT: Looks like I wasn't the first to think of this. Someone named T. Ranha suggested the same approach in a comment on the video: ""... Bringing 2^B to the other side we get: 2^C+2^D=2^E+2^B. Now lets look at the problem in binary.

The other passengers either know some of the others or they do not. There is an 11th person though, who doesn’t know the singer. In order to determine who he (she) is, he asks one particular passenger, say, Aaron, if he knows some other passenger, say Jenny and Aaron must reply by yes or no. What is the maximum number of such questions the 11th person must ask so as to determine the singer? Let’s assume that the 11th person does not know whether the singer is male or female and that the relationships are not mutual (i.e. if Aaron knows Jenny, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Jenny knows Aaron).

The other passengers either know some of the others or they do not. There is an 11th person though, who doesn’t know the singer. In order to determine who he (she) is, he asks one particular passenger, say, Aaron, if he knows some other passenger, say Jenny and Aaron must reply by yes or no. What is the maximum number of such questions the 11th person must ask so as to determine the singer?

70,How to win Matt Parker's jackpot - finding the median of the following distribution,How to win Matt Parker's jackpot - finding the median of the following distribution,,"In a recent video the legendary Matt Parker claimed he kept flipping a two-sided (fair) coin untill he scored a sequence of ten consecutive 'switch flips', i.e. letting $T$ denote a tail and $H$ a head, then a sequence of ten switch flips is defined to be either $THTHTHTHTH$ or $HTHTHTHTHT$. He set up a contest and allowed each viewer to guess once at the exact amount of flips he needed to obtain such a sequence. The ten viewers with the ten closest answers would be awarded a prize. The contest is over, so there is no incentive to keep a solution to the following problem to yourself. What is the best number to bet? Of course this somehow depends on how other viewers answer: you are more likely to win if your bet is not close to many other bets, so if a large number of viewers is mathematically inclined and bets the same number - say 1023 - then it no longer is the best (profit maximizing) bet. I've therefore simplified to the following question: let $X$ be the stochastic variable representing the number of flips needed untill a sequence of ten consecutive switch flips if obtained, then for which number $a \in \mathbb{N}$ does the expected value of the (absolute value of the) error $$ \mathbb{E}[\vert X - a \vert] $$ reach its minimal value? It is well-known that $a$ is the median of the (distribution of) $X$, but how can one compute it? Numerical approximations are welcome, theoretical (generalizable) results are preferred. I found a way to compute the expected value of $X$ itself for general $n$ (i.e. the total number of coin flips needed to get a sequence of the form $THTHTHTH...$ or $HTHTHTHT...$ of length $n$). Let $\mathbb{E}_i$ denote the expected number of coin flips needed to get a desired sequence of length $n$, assuming we already have a sequence of length $i \in \mathbb{N}$. We immediately find $$ \mathbb{E}_0 = 1 + \mathbb{E}_1 $$ since we are certain to have a sequence of length $1$ after one flip. Furthermore, for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ $$ \mathbb{E}_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbb{E}_1 + 1\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbb{E}_{i+1} + 1\right) $$ since, given a sequence of $i$ flips which ends, say, on a tail, we have a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance to increase this to a sequence of $i+1$ flips (if we get, say, a head) and a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance to get back where we started, at $1$ flip. Using that $\mathbb{E}_n = 0$ the above gives us system of $n$ equations in the $n$ variables $\mathbb{E}_0, \ldots, \mathbb{E}_{n-1}$. One can easily check that the unique solution is given by $$ \mathbb{E}_i = 2^{n} - 2^{i} \quad 0 \leq i \leq n $$ Since Matt Parker started at $0$ and wanted to get $10$ flips, the expected value of the number of flips needed is $2^{10} - 1 = 1023$ and this should be a reasonable bet. Does anyone know how to find the distribution of $X$ (or directly the median of $X$)? Like I said, analytical solutions are of course preferred, but any kind of method - even requiring numerical computations, but preferably not Monte Carlo simulations - would be interesting to me. EDIT: I found out that the problem can be reduced to a combinatorial problem. Indeed, we have that $$ P(X \leq k) = \frac{\# \lbrace \text{sequences of length $k$ which contain a desired subsequence of length $n$}\rbrace}{2^k} $$ where $2^k$ is the total number of sequences of length $k$, since every sequence of length $k$ is equally likely to occur.

We have a map $$ f: S_k \to S_{k-1} $$ where, for any sequence $s \in S_k$, the $i$th element of $f(s)$ is $1$ if $s(i) \neq s(i+1)$ and $0$ is $s(i) = s(i+1)$. This map makes the desired sequences in $S_k$ correspond bijectively with the sequences in $S_{k-1}$ which contain $n-1$ zeroes in a row.

The idea is that if a partition contains a single large block, the expected number of blocks must fall. For my purposes, smaller values of $m$ are superior, but I would be interested to see anything. The following reasoning led me to believe $m = \lceil n / A_n \rceil$ would be big enough. The average size of a block in a partition of $[n]$ is at most $\lceil n / A_n \rceil$.

86,Minimum Size of Word Search Containing All Strings of Length $l$,Minimum Size of Word Search Containing All Strings of Length,l,"The following is a problem I came up with and have been thinking through for the last several days, making little progress. The problem statement is deceptively simple, and (unless I'm missing something), the problem itself proves to be fairly difficult. Consider a $m * n$ grid, with $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Each element in this grid can contain one of $k$ letters. We will denote such a construction a word search. What is the minimum size of a word search that contains all strings of length $l$? Size here is defined as area, or $m*n$. Furthermore, you can find a string looking left, right, up, down, or diagonally, and strings can overlap. My progress: We first note that there are $k^l$ possible strings of length $l$. Therefore, we could take the trivial construction of a $k^l * l$ grid, each row containing one unique string of length $l$. However, this is inefficient in several ways. First, noting that we can read strings backwards as well as forwards, we can immediately cut the number of rows by almost a half (strings which are palindromes can't be cut). Also, this doesn't even begin to account for the number of ways we can look at strings vertically (both upwards and downwards), and diagonally. I also noted that the optimal construction will probably be a square, or close to it. My reasoning for this is because if we have a $m * n$ grid, assuming WLOG that $m < n$, note that adding one row will increase the net number of strings present by more than adding another column. One possible idea is to use a greedy algorithm that operates as follows: 1) Construct a set of all $k^l$ strings. We will use this to track progress - every time we add a new string to our search, we will remove it from the set, and our goal is to empty the set. 2) Create an empty $l * l$ grid. 3) Consider all possible ways to populate that grid with each of the $k$ letters in each element, and choose the population that minimizes the size of the set (ie removes the most number of strings from the set). 4) Recursive step: let the size of the grid be $n * n$ currently. Consider all possible additions of $2n+1$ letters, adding $n$ letters below the last row, $n$ the the right of the last column, and the remaining $1$ to fill in the square. Whichever one decreases the set size the most is chosen. Repeat this until we're done. This algorithm is clearly not perfect, as it requires the right choice of a kernel, and also could be very inefficient towards the end. We can also use this same algorithm, but instead of adding the L shape at the bottom right, we can surround the entire thing with a square. This may yield more accurate results. I'd appreciate any ideas, from establishing an upper/lower bound on the size combinatorically, to finding an algorithm, or any sort of geometric/algebraic approach. I'm not sure if probabilistic method would be helpful here, but after reading into it I think it may be. All progress will be really helpful!

96,Players tournament,Players tournament,,"In the final phase of a television game show, the $N$ finalists competed exactly once with each other, receiving $10$ points for each win, $5$ points for each draw, and no points for losses. At the final ranking, the total number of points won by each of the players in positions $1$ to $N-10,$ were received as follows: $50\%$ from games played against the players in positions $N-9$ to $N$ and the rest of them in games with all others. Similarly, $50\%$ of points won by each of the players in positions $N-9$ to $N,$ were received from games against the players that were ranked in positions $1$ to $N-10.$ Find the number of players. My humble attempt: All games played were $N(N-1)/2.$ Assuming there were $W$ wins, there were equally $L$ losses and $W=L,$ so there were $N(N-1)/2-2W$ draws. The total points won by all players were $10W+5(N(N-1)/2-2W) = 5(N(N-1)/2).$ Total points won by each of the players in positions $1$ to $N-10:$ Each player played $N-1$ games, of which $10$ were with the players in the last $10$ positions (clearly different players from them). So he gained $50\%$ of his points from $N-1-10$ games and $50\%$ of his points from $10$ games... and this is where I am stuck!
