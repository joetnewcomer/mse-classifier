Knuth's book, Surreal Numbers , and I've been struggling for days now with one little step in a single proof. Specifically, I'm trying to work through the proof that every surreal number is bounded by the elements of its left and right sets. That is, for a surreal number $x = \{ X_L \,|\, X_R \}$ , prove that $x_L \le x$ and that $x \le x_R$ for all numbers $x_L \in X_L$ and $x_R \in X_R$ . The proof starts by way of contradiction, assuming that there exists some number $x_l \in X_L$ such that $x_L \not\le x$ . From this statement, the second axiom of surreal numbers gives us two possible cases; either there exists a number $x_{LL} \in X_{LL}$ (where $X_{LL}$ is $x_L$ 's left set), with $x_{LL} \ge x$ , or else there exists a number $x_R \in X_R$ with $x_L \ge x_R$ . This second case is an obvious contradiction of the first axiom of surreal numbers, so we go on checking the sole remaining case with $x_{LL} \ge x$ . The proof then seems to try to chain this relation and another together with the transitive rule, eventually producing a contradiction. The transitive rule has been proved prior to this point in the book for the $\ge$ relation, so we just need a second relation to use it. And this is where I hit my wall. The proof goes on to say that $x_{LL} \le x_L$ , and I cannot for the life of me figure out the justification. Here's the wording for that statement in the book (Just after Ch 5 begins): B. (continuing from above proof) ...But what can we do with $x_{LL}$ ? I don't like double subscripts. A. Well, $x_{LL}$ is an element of the left set of $x_L$ .

My Approach: Let us select subset $A$ first which would mean that the selection of subset $B$ depends on $A$ . Let $n(A)$ denote the number of elements in subset $A$ . Suppose $n(A)=k$ , then the subset $B$ has control over the selection of remaining $(n-k)$ elements which means that the number of such possible pairs $=\binom{n}{k}2^{n-k}$ $$\therefore \text {Total unordered pairs} =\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}2^{n-k}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{n-k}2^{n-k}$$ $$=(1+2)^n=3^n$$ I just want to verify my solution.

Currently, I've gotten through the first and second forms. Mainly: (1) For any relation $R$ , there is a function $H \subseteq R$ with dom $H$ = dom $R$ (2) For any set $I$ and any function $H$ with domain $I$ , if $H(i) \neq \varnothing$ for all $i \in I$ , then $\prod_{i \in I} H_i \neq \varnothing$ .

I have a vague notion right now in my head, and I think an alternative explanation of the same concept my give me a deeper understanding. Now, onto the proof. Proof Suppose the first form is true. Define a relation $R$ as follows: $$R = I \times \bigcup_{i \in I} H(i).$$ By the first form of the axiom of choice, we can construct a function $f \subseteq R$ with dom $f$ = dom $R$ $= I$ . This means that $f(i) = R(i)$ for all $i \in I$ and by definition of $R$ , $f(i) \in H(i)$ . Hence, $f \in \prod_{i \in I} H_i$ . Now for the converse, suppose the second form is true. Then  for a relation $R$ , let $I =$ dom $R$ . Define a function $H: I \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(\text{ran } R)$ where $H(i) := \{x \in \text{ran } R \mid iRx \}$ . By the axiom of choice, $\prod_{i \in I} H_i \neq \varnothing$ , so there exists a function $f$ with $\text{dom }f = I$ such that $(\forall i \in I) f(i) \in H(i)$ . That means $(\forall i \in I) iRf(i)$ . So $f \in R$ and $\text{dom } f = \text{dom } R$ . Thus, the two forms are equivalent. Q.E.D.

I should stress that I find important point 2 to be the starting point of this construction. I'm going to outline it: Let's assume that we have already defined ordinals. We know that every successor of an ordinal is still an ordinal. Starting from $0 = \emptyset$ , which is the smallest ordinal, we can construct some ordinals by finding iteratively (but finitely) the successor ordinal of the previous one. That is $$0 = \emptyset\\ 1 = \{\emptyset\}\\ 2 = \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\\ 3 = \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\}\\\dots\\ n = \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\},\dots\}\\\dots$$ we know that these ordinals exist, right?. What we don't know is if there exist a set containing them. We define the class of finite ordinals with the following formula: $$FON(x) = ON(x)\wedge\forall y[(y \le x) \wedge (y \neq 0) \Rightarrow \exists z\{y = z \cup \{z\}\}]$$ So finite ordinals are those successor ordinals whose elements are all successor ordinals. We have that each ordinals $n$ we constructed above satisy this formula. Here is the first question: can we say the converse? Can we say that every $x$ such that $FON(x)$ is explicitely definable (with a finite iteration) as for $n$ ? However our new objective is to identify natural numbers and finite ordinals, and we want to prove that the class finite ordinals is a set $\omega$ (which we will eventually identify with $\mathbb{N}$ ). We introduce the axiom of infinity: $$\exists I(\emptyset \in I \wedge \forall x \in I((x \cup \{x\}) \in I))$$ and we'll call $I$ an inductive set. We want to show that every finite ordinal belongs to every inductive set. If the equivalence, conjectured in the previuos point, between finite ordinals and ordinals iteratively constructed from $\emptyset$ were to be true, then this would follow easly. Now, thanks to the axiom scheme of specification, we can extract from $I$ the subset of all the elements of $I$ that are finite ordinals. So we define $$\omega = \{x \in I : FON(x)\}$$ We then have that, since every finite ordinal belongs to every inductive set, $$FON(x) \Rightarrow x \in I \Rightarrow x \in \omega$$ on the other hand we have $$x \in \omega \Rightarrow FON(x)$$ by the definition of $\omega$ .

So if you have another set $D = \{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$ , there is no surjective function from $C$ to $D$ because $C$ has two elements and $D$ has six, even though $C$ consists of elements that, as their own creatures, so to speak, contain three elements each? I know this question is painfully dumb, so here's a question that's hopefully a little more interesting and clarifies why this is an issue: When you consider the set $C$ , can a function, correspondence, or relation to or from $C$ ever meaningfully reference the elements contained inside $A$ and $B$ ?

I wrote a proof, but I don't know if it's rigourous enough or even correct, and I would be grateful for pointing out mistakes and guiding to how to do it better. The proof is: $\triangleleft$ In $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$, for every ordered pair $\langle x, y\rangle $ (including the pairs of type $\langle x, n\rangle $) there exists a subset of ordered pairs that have the same first coordinate and lesser second coordinate: $\{\langle x, y-1\rangle , \langle x, y-2\rangle , \langle x, y-3\rangle , \dots\}$.

The cardinality of this set is $n-1$, where $n$ is a natural (and, therefore, finite) number. Since isomorphism preserves the order, if sets $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic, then their subsets $\dot A \subset A$ and $\dot B \subset B$ constructed by the same rule should also be isomorphic. However, in our construction even cardinalities don't match: one is infinite, another one is not. The Cartesian products in question are not isomorphic, therefore.  $\triangleright$ I did search through the stackexchange and clicked the proposed links while writing this question, but, unfortunately, found nothing. Thank you a lot! Here's a new proof (note: in the proof above, $0$ was not considered a natural number; in the proof below, it is): $\triangleleft$ The ordering: the major index is the second coordinate. Assume the contrary:  $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ is isomorphic to  $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Then, $\langle 0, 0\rangle $ from $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ is mapped to some $\langle a, b\rangle $  in $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. With both $\langle 0, 0\rangle $ and $\langle a, b\rangle $ there is associated a subset of either $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ comprised of lesser elements: $\{\dots, \langle -z, 0\rangle , \dots, \langle -2, 0\rangle , \langle -1, 0\rangle \}$ $\subset$ $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ for $\langle 0, 0\rangle $, $\{\dots, \langle x, b-1\rangle , \dots, \langle a-2, b\rangle , \langle a-1, b\rangle \}$ $\subset$ $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ for $\langle a, b\rangle $. Since isomorphism preserves the order, $\langle a-1, b\rangle  \mapsto \langle -1, 0\rangle , $ $\langle a-2, b\rangle  \mapsto \langle -2, 0\rangle $ and so on. Now, where would we map $\langle x, b-1\rangle $? We would have to map it to some element given by formula $\langle -z, 0\rangle $ (it's the only available option). However, between $\langle -z, 0\rangle $ and, say, $\langle -2, 0\rangle $ there is a finite amount of pairs, and between $\langle x, b-1\rangle $ and $\langle a-2, b\rangle $ there is an infinite one.

Since isomorphism preserves the order, if sets $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic, then their subsets $\dot A \subset A$ and $\dot B \subset B$ constructed by the same rule should also be isomorphic. However, in our construction even cardinalities don't match: one is infinite, another one is not. The Cartesian products in question are not isomorphic, therefore.  $\triangleright$ I did search through the stackexchange and clicked the proposed links while writing this question, but, unfortunately, found nothing. Thank you a lot! Here's a new proof (note: in the proof above, $0$ was not considered a natural number; in the proof below, it is): $\triangleleft$ The ordering: the major index is the second coordinate. Assume the contrary:  $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ is isomorphic to  $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Then, $\langle 0, 0\rangle $ from $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ is mapped to some $\langle a, b\rangle $  in $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. With both $\langle 0, 0\rangle $ and $\langle a, b\rangle $ there is associated a subset of either $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ comprised of lesser elements: $\{\dots, \langle -z, 0\rangle , \dots, \langle -2, 0\rangle , \langle -1, 0\rangle \}$ $\subset$ $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$ for $\langle 0, 0\rangle $, $\{\dots, \langle x, b-1\rangle , \dots, \langle a-2, b\rangle , \langle a-1, b\rangle \}$ $\subset$ $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ for $\langle a, b\rangle $. Since isomorphism preserves the order, $\langle a-1, b\rangle  \mapsto \langle -1, 0\rangle , $ $\langle a-2, b\rangle  \mapsto \langle -2, 0\rangle $ and so on. Now, where would we map $\langle x, b-1\rangle $? We would have to map it to some element given by formula $\langle -z, 0\rangle $ (it's the only available option). However, between $\langle -z, 0\rangle $ and, say, $\langle -2, 0\rangle $ there is a finite amount of pairs, and between $\langle x, b-1\rangle $ and $\langle a-2, b\rangle $ there is an infinite one. But for isomorphism to exist, these amounts must be equal. Contradiction. $\triangleright$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

So then for defining when a formula $\varphi$ is a logical consequence of a structure $\mathfrak A$ (written as: $\mathfrak A \models \varphi$ ), I've seen texts start out with something like: Given that $t_1 , ... , t_n$ are terms and tha $P$ is a predicate symbol of arity $n$ : $\mathfrak A$ $\models $ P( $t_1$ ,..., $t_n$ ) iff ( $d_1$ ,..., $d_n$ ) $\in$ $I(P)$ , where $d_i$ = || $t_i$ || where || $t_i$ || is the notation used for the denotation of term $t_i$ .

If my understanding is correct, then a 0-ary predicate $P$ is a logical consequence iff $\emptyset \in I(P)$ . Depending on our interpretation, $I(P)$ will be either the set $\{ \emptyset \}$ or the set $\emptyset$ . If under our interpretation, $P$ is mapped to the set $\emptyset$ , then $\mathfrak A$ $\models P$ does not hold as $\emptyset \notin \emptyset$ . Hence why we associate false with $\emptyset$ .

99,Definition of the rank of an abelian group,Definition of the rank of an abelian group,,"According to wikipedia , the rank of an abelian group $G$ is the size of the largest free abelian group contained in $G$. So, is the rank of $G$ equal to: $$\sup \{|F|\mid {F\text{ is a subgroup of }G\text{, }F\text{ is a free abelian group} }\}$$ ? here, $|F|$ is the cardinality of $F$. I'm looking for a symbolic definition in general case.
