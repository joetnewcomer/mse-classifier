2,Topology of the Segre product vs. the product topology,Topology of the Segre product vs. the product topology,,"In general, the product topology on two (quasiprojective) varieties is not the same as the topology of the product variety given by the Segre embedding.  This is something I've often seen asserted is true, but I'm having difficulties writing down a complete proof of this fact.  What I want to prove is Let $V \subseteq \mathbb{P}^m$, $W \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n$ be varieties with the Zariski topology.  Then the product topology on $V \times W$ is not the same as the topology of the Segre product $\sigma(V \times W)$, unless one of the varieties is simply a finite set of points. This is an early exercise in Harris' Algebraic geometry - a first course (Exer. 2.22) and in Smith's An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry (Exer. 5.3.4).  This is likely a standard fact, but regardless I indicate the kind of partial progress I've made below (possibly red herrings) - feel free to skip the walls of text below. Firstly, this fact is easily ""proved"" when explicit varieties $V, W$ are given.  For example, if $V = W = \mathbb{P}^1$, one can simply use the diagonal in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ as an example of a Zariski-closed set in $\sigma(\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1)$ that is not closed in the product topology.  From this and other examples, I believe that in the cases that the topologies differ, the topology on $\sigma(V \times W)$ is finer than the product topology. Next, if neither $V$ nor $W$ is a finite set of points, then $\dim V, \dim W > 0$, so one may assume by restricting to a subvariety that $V$ and $W$ are actually one-dimensional irreducible varieties.  In this case, the closed sets of $V \times W$ are well-known: the closed sets in $V$ and $W$ are the empty set, the whole set, or a finite number of points, and so the closed sets in $V \times W$ are the arbitrary intersections of finite unions of the products of such sets. At this point, I see several different avenues that may lead to a proof.  The first is more of an geometric approach.  We want to find a set that is closed in $\sigma(X \times Y)$ but not $X \times Y$; might not some ""tilted"" hyperplane section do the trick?  Or perhaps we can mimick the example with $V = W = \mathbb{P}^1$.  The diagonal may not make sense in general, but if we have a nonconstant morphism $V \to W$ or $W \to V$, then we can use the graph of this morphism in place of the diagonal to conclude.  We also know that the closed sets in $\sigma(V \times W)$ are the zero locus of bihomogeneous polynomials. Another approach is to work in the (homogeneous) coordinate rings.  That is, we wish to find a proper (prime) ideal containing $I(\sigma(V \times W))$ where we do not simply add in ""products"" of polynomials in $k[V]$ and $k[W]$.  The fact that we are working with one-dimensional irreducible varieties means that the transcendence degree of $k[\sigma(V \times W)]$ is two, so one simply needs to quotient out by one transcendental element that does not correspond to a closed set already in the product topology $V \times W$.  Finally, one may exploit the fact that the Segre product is the categorical product in the category of varieties and the topological product is the categorical product in the category of spaces.  If the Segre product is the categorical product in the category of spaces too and the projection maps are the same in this category, then the ""unique"" morphism from $X \times Y$ to $\sigma(X \times Y)$ is $\sigma$ on the level of sets, so one simply needs to show that $\sigma$ is not continuous. Unfortunately, I am unable to turn any of these vague ideas into a complete proof.  Since this result is so basic, I fear that I am overlooking something simple, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could tell me what it is I'm missing.","In general, the product topology on two (quasiprojective) varieties is not the same as the topology of the product variety given by the Segre embedding.

We further said that each of these surfaces (with different number of holes) is ""topologically different"" because one would need to ""rip"" or ""tear"" the surface to get another, but in this ""game"" we only allow ""stretching"" or ""twisting"" as the means of deformation.

I'd like to show $f$ is an open map. Now I was wondering what will happen if this last statement will be true except for a single point, i.e. exists a $u_0$ such that for each $u\in U$ if $u\neq u_0$ then there exists a neighbourhood $V_u$ in $U$ such that $f\uparrow_{V_u}$ is one-to-one. Is it still true to say that $f$ is an open map? Or perhaps I need to add another assumption to make it correct? I tried proving it by taking any open set $V\subseteq U$, and writing it as a union of open sets $\{V_i\}_{i\in I}$ (a solution suggested by @Joe Manlove ), by taking  $ \hat V_v $ to be a neighborhood with $ f\uparrow_{\hat{V}_v}$ that is $1:1$, for every $v\in V $, and then taking $ V_v := \hat V_v \cap V $, so that $V_v\subseteq V$, thus making their union be exactly $V$. Then I can use Invariance of Domain Theorem on each $V_i$, thus getting that $f(V)$ is a union of open sets, thus open as well.  But the problem now is that I might not be able to find such cover, because of the possibility of $a$ being in $V$. What I tried to do was to take the union for all the other $V_v$ where $v\neq a$, and then proving that $a$ must be in this union, because $U$ is an open set. But then again I'm not so sure this is correct, and I thought perhaps there's another assumption (possibly a small one) I need to make before being able to prove this? Other than this case, I was wondering, if this is correct, does it mean I can have more than a single ""bad"" point, i.e. $u_0,...,u_n$ and $f$ will still be an open set?

Now I was wondering what will happen if this last statement will be true except for a single point, i.e. exists a $u_0$ such that for each $u\in U$ if $u\neq u_0$ then there exists a neighbourhood $V_u$ in $U$ such that $f\uparrow_{V_u}$ is one-to-one. Is it still true to say that $f$ is an open map? Or perhaps I need to add another assumption to make it correct? I tried proving it by taking any open set $V\subseteq U$, and writing it as a union of open sets $\{V_i\}_{i\in I}$ (a solution suggested by @Joe Manlove ), by taking  $ \hat V_v $ to be a neighborhood with $ f\uparrow_{\hat{V}_v}$ that is $1:1$, for every $v\in V $, and then taking $ V_v := \hat V_v \cap V $, so that $V_v\subseteq V$, thus making their union be exactly $V$. Then I can use Invariance of Domain Theorem on each $V_i$, thus getting that $f(V)$ is a union of open sets, thus open as well.  But the problem now is that I might not be able to find such cover, because of the possibility of $a$ being in $V$. What I tried to do was to take the union for all the other $V_v$ where $v\neq a$, and then proving that $a$ must be in this union, because $U$ is an open set. But then again I'm not so sure this is correct, and I thought perhaps there's another assumption (possibly a small one) I need to make before being able to prove this? Other than this case, I was wondering, if this is correct, does it mean I can have more than a single ""bad"" point, i.e. $u_0,...,u_n$ and $f$ will still be an open set?

14,Verifying continuity of the deformation retraction of the mapping cylinder,Verifying continuity of the deformation retraction of the mapping cylinder,,"Given $f : X \rightarrow Y$ I have the mapping cylinder $M_f = (X \times I) \sqcup Y / \sim$ where $I = [0,1]$ and $(x,0)_1$ is glued to $f(x)_2$ (I'd like to be pedantic for this verification so I'm adding subscripts resulting from the disjoint union). It is usually said that the mapping cylinder deformation retracts to the subspace $Y$; again being pedantic what must be meant is that $M_f$ deformation retracts to the subspace consisting of the points $\{y_2\}$ for $y \in Y-f(X)$ and $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$ for $x \in X$, I'll call this subspace $C = \{\{y_2\}, \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \: | \: y \in Y - f(X), x \in X\}$. My first question is that do we not have to be pedantic here because I assume that we could only loosely say $Y$ instead of this subspace if these two spaces were homeomorphic and for the obvious map between them to be a homeomoprhism in general we would require that $f$ be an injection? Secondly, I'd like to verify that the expected deformation retraction is indeed one. $M_f$ consists of three types of points, $\{y_2\}$'s, $\{(x,s)_1\}$'s and $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$'s; and the relevant map $M_f \times I \rightarrow M_f$ is $$\left(\{y_2\}, t\right) \mapsto \{y_2\} \:\:\: \forall y \in Y - f(X), t \in I,$$ $$\left(\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\},t\right) \mapsto \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, t \in I,$$ $$\left(\{(x,s)_1\},t\right) \mapsto \{(x,(1-t)s)_1\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, s \in (0,1], t \in [0,1),$$ $$\left(\{(x,s)_1\},1\right) \mapsto \{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \:\:\: \forall x \in X, s \in (0,1].$$ That the map $M_f \rightarrow M_f$ retrieved by setting $t = 0$ is the identity map is clear, and so is that the map retrieved by setting $t = 1$ maps all of $M_f$ onto $C$ and finally that each map for a fixed $t$ restricted to $C$ is the identity map. The only concern is continuity. I was able to show that each map for a fixed $t$ is continuous (in a manner similar to how I attempted this problem), but not this map from $M_f \times I \rightarrow M_f$ that we have here. My attempt is as follows: Let $U$ be any open subset of $M_f$; $U$ consists of points $\{y_2\}$ for $y$ in some $B \subseteq Y$, of points $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$ for $x$ in some $A \subseteq X$ and of points $\{(x,s)_1\}$ for $(x,s)$ in some $Q \subseteq X \times (0,1]$. Using the definitions of the quotient and disjoint union topologies this tells us that $B \cup f(A)$ is open in $Y$ and that $A \times \{0\} \cup Q$ is open in $X \times I$. The preimage of $U$ under our map above is the union of the following $$\{\{y_2\} \: | \: y \in B\} \times I,$$ (where the $\{y_2\}$'s come from) $$\{\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\} \: | \: x \in A\} \times I,$$ $$\{\{(x,s)_1\} \: | \: x \in A, s \in (0,1]\} \times \{1\},$$ (where the $\{(x,0)_1,f(x)_2\}$'s come from), and $$\{(\{(x,s)_1\},t) \: | \: (x,s,t) \in \varphi^{-1}[Q]\}$$ (where the $\{(x,s)_1\}$'s come from) where $\varphi : X \times (0,1] \times [0,1) \rightarrow X \times I : (x,s,t) \mapsto (x,(1-t)s)$. In the cases of the maps for each fixed $t$, the preimages worked out to be similar but simpler and openness wasn't too difficult to establish. Here all I have been able to say is that because $A \times \{0\} \cup Q$ is open in $X \times I$, its preimage under $\varphi$, which is in fact just $\varphi^{-1}[Q]$ because the second coordinate of any image point cannot be zero, is open in $X \times (0,1] \times [0,1)$ and as a result in $X \times [0,1] \times [0,1]$, this then implies that our final set $\{(\{(x,s)_1\},t) \: | \: (x,s,t) \in \varphi^{-1}[Q]\}$ is open in $M_f \times I$. From here however I haven't been able to get further. I've tried picking points in one of the four sets and then trying to combine subsets of the four sets in various ways to find an open set containing the point within our four sets and I've noted some small things like the first two of our four sets may be considered together in the form $E \cup I$ with $E \subseteq M_f$ and the pullback across the quotient projection map and then the disjoint union inclusion map of $E$ gives $B \cup f(A)$ in $Y$ which is known to be open but we get $A \times \{0\}$ in $X \times I$.

17,What is a good category of tame topological spaces?,What is a good category of tame topological spaces?,,"While the definition of a topological space nicely encapsulates the notion of points being close to each other, it doesn't seem to be a good notion of space.

There are many distinct notions of manifolds and other spaces patched up local models (like CW-complexes ). Often the definitions don't even seem to be standardized (see for example my question on closed neighborhood deformation retracts or find the ""right"" definition of locally compact space ). Those variations are necessary, as there are many pathological counterexamples (like for example the topologist's sine curve , the Warsaw circle or the Hawaiian earring in the context of connectivity).

22,Is simple connectedness of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ detected by winding numbers?,Is simple connectedness of subsets of  detected by winding numbers?,\mathbb{R}^2,"If $X\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a connected open subset which is not simply connected, then there exists some point $p\in\mathbb{R}^2\setminus X$ such that the inclusion map $X\to\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{p\}$ induces a nontrivial map on $\pi_1$ .  In other words, if a connected open subset of the plane is not simply connected, this is always because it contains a loop which winds around some point in its complement.  More strongly, in fact, there is some point $p\in\mathbb{R}^2\setminus X$ such that $X$ contains a simple closed curve that has $p$ in its interior.  (See here for one way to prove this.) My question is whether this is still true for arbitrary (not necessarily open) subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ .  More precisely: Suppose $X\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is path-connected but not simply connected.  Must there exist some point $p\in\mathbb{R}^2\setminus X$ such that the inclusion map $X\to\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \{p\}$ induces a nontrivial map on $\pi_1$ ?  More strongly, must there exist such $p$ such that $X$ contains a simple closed curve that has $p$ in its interior, or at least a curve with winding number $1$ around $p$ (so the map on $\pi_1$ is surjective)? I suspect the answer is yes, since I've heard of various results saying that arbitrary subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are homotopically ""tame"" in various ways (for instance, unlike in higher dimensions, they cannot have nontrivial $H_k$ for $k\geq 2$ ).  The closest result to my question that I know of is the result from this answer that if $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ then any nontrivial element in $\pi_1(X)$ remains nontrivial in $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus F)$ for some finite set $F\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2\setminus X$ .  This is very close to my question: it is weaker since it involves a finite set $F$ rather than a single point, but stronger since it applies to an arbitrary nontrivial element of $\pi_1(X)$ rather than just saying there exists an element of $\pi_1(X)$ that remains nontrivial.  I would guess you can prove an affirmative answer to my question either from that result or using ideas similar to its proof, but I don't see an obvious way to do so.  (Note that the finite set $F$ in that result cannot be reduced to a single point, since your element of $\pi_1(X)$ could be a commutator of loops around different points.) (Alternatively, by the argument I linked above in the case of open subsets, it would suffice to show that there exists a nontrivial loop in $X$ with only finitely many self-intersections, since then you can use that to reduce to a nontrivial simple loop and then invoke the Jordan curve theorem.)","If is a connected open subset which is not simply connected, then there exists some point such that the inclusion map induces a nontrivial map on .

In other words, what should the function $k(r)$ be so that, no matter where the $m$ sites are placed, we can always find a disk of radius $r$ containing $k(r)$ of them? I would hope it is simply $m$ times the fraction of the surface area of the sphere covered by a disk. After all, if the average density of sites on the sphere is $m/A$, there must be some disk whose density is at least the average, right? This would be easily proved if you could tile the sphere with disks with no overlap, but you can't, so I'm not sure. If it turns out to depend on the packing density of disks on a sphere, I'll be happy with a reasonable lower bound. If you replace the unit sphere and the disks with unit ball and smaller balls of radius $r < 1$ in $\mathbb R^3$, and the area ratio with the volume ratio, then the naive guess doesn't work.

Now given a topological space $X$ , we could define: $$ S_{\infty}(X):=\{\sigma:\Delta_{\infty}\to X : \ \sigma \ \text{is continous}\} $$ Normally the boundary operator is defined as: $$\partial \sigma=\sigma\circ d_0 -\sigma\circ d_1+...(-)^n\sigma\circ d_n$$ Where $d_i$ embeds the $n-1$ -simplex into the $n$ -simplex by adding a $0$ in $i$ -th coordinate. If the simplex is infinite dimensional, adding a zero simply embeds $\Delta_{\infty}$ in itself. So maybe(given a ring $R$ ) we could define a boundary operator $\partial_{\infty}$ : $$ 0 \to RS_{\infty}(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_{\infty}} RS_{\infty}(X) \xrightarrow{\partial_{\infty}} RS_{\infty}(X)  \to 0$$ Such that $\partial_{\infty}\circ \partial_{\infty}=0$ .

The fixed point degree at a point can loosely be thought of as the multiplicity of the map at that point. We define the Lefschetz Zeta function by $$\zeta_{f}(z)=\exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Lambda_{f^n}\frac{z^n}{n}\right)$$ and we see using the Lefschetz Hopf theorem that $$\zeta_{f}(z)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\det(1-zf_{\ast}\vert H_{i}(X,\mathbb{C}))^{(-1)^{i+1}}$$ Now this is all very well and good, but as far as I can tell there is nothing new to be gained from $\zeta_{f}(z)$.

When would I actually learn anything by constructing this function?","Given a compact, triangulable space $X$ and a continuous function $f: X\rightarrow X$, then we define the Lefschetz number $\Lambda_{f}$ by $$\Lambda_{f} = \sum_{k\geq0}(-1)^{k}Tr(f_{\ast}\vert H_{k}(X,\mathbb{C}))$$ If $f$ has only finitely many fixed points, then  by the Lefschetz-Hopf theorem $$\Lambda_{f}=\sum_{x=f(x)}i(f,x)$$ where $i(f,x)$ is the fixed point degree of the fixed point $x$. The fixed point degree at a point can loosely be thought of as the multiplicity of the map at that point. We define the Lefschetz Zeta function by $$\zeta_{f}(z)=\exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Lambda_{f^n}\frac{z^n}{n}\right)$$ and we see using the Lefschetz Hopf theorem that $$\zeta_{f}(z)=\prod_{i=0}^{n}\det(1-zf_{\ast}\vert H_{i}(X,\mathbb{C}))^{(-1)^{i+1}}$$ Now this is all very well and good, but as far as I can tell there is nothing new to be gained from $\zeta_{f}(z)$.

44,Questions related to intersections of open sets and Baire spaces,Questions related to intersections of open sets and Baire spaces,,"EDIT: I have reposted this question on MathOverflow. (The version posted there is more concise, with some details omitted. I have also added a question about pseudobases with similar property.) MO copy: Intersections of open sets and $\alpha$ -favorable spaces I was curious a little about the classes of topological spaces described below. For each of them I want to ask whether they have been studied and whether they have some interesting properties. (Although I do not think that they are going to be particularly useful, since all these properties seem to be more natural if the intersections of open sets in the definitions below are replaced by intersections of their closures.) For the purpose of this post I have made up some names for these classes of spaces. I know that my question is a little vague - I am basically asking whether these classes were studied somewhere, what are they called (if they have a name) and whether they have some interesting properties; although it is rather subjective what can be considered interesting. Below I will try to write down what I was able to find out by myself and I will also try to give some motivation for the question. Question 1. What is name/characterization of spaces such that $\bigcap \mathcal F\ne\emptyset$ for every open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ . Let us call such spaces u.i.-spaces . (Where ""u.i."" stands for ultrafilter intersection). 1 Question 2 . What is name/characterization of spaces such that $\bigcap \mathcal F\ne\emptyset$ for every open filter $\mathcal F$ . Let us call such spaces f.i.-spaces . (Where ""f.i."" stands for filter intersection). I will try to show below that the conditions f.i. and u.i. are in fact equivalent. And I will also give a reformulation, which is more similar to the conditions in the following two questions. (I hope I have not made a mistake in the proof below.) But the above formulation is closer to the result from [HM], which motivated me to ask about these spaces, so I have kept this formulation. I was able to find some papers, where this class of spaces is mentioned. Question 3 . What about the spaces with this property: For any countable system of non-empty open sets $\{U_n; n=1,2,3,\dots\}$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2\supseteq U_3\supseteq \dots$ , the intersection $\bigcap U_n\ne\emptyset$ . Let us call such spaces c.o.i. spaces . (Where ""c.o.i."" stands for countable open intersection). Question 4 . What is name/characterization of topological spaces with this property: $X$ has a base $\mathcal B$ such that for any countable system of sets $U_n\in\mathcal B$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2\supseteq U_3\supseteq \dots$ , the intersection $\bigcap U_n\ne\emptyset$ . Let us call such spaces c.b.i. spaces . (Where ""c.b.i."" stands for countable basic intersection). All these classes seem to be related to Baire spaces somehow. The reason why I wondered what can be said about these classes of spaces was the result that u.i. spaces are Baire spaces, which I mention below. Some basic observations Reformulation using closed covers. It is clear that in the definition of c.o.i. space we can replace decreasing countable family of non-empty open sets by a countable family of open sets with finite intersection property. By a standard argument we see that this is equivalent to: Every countable cover of $X$ by closed sets has a finite subcover. Equivalence of f.i. and u.i. Similar condition for all closed covers (not only countable ones) was discussed a little in one of the answers to this question: Terminologies related to ""compact?"" It seems that some authors call such spaces strongly S-closed spaces . In [D, Theorem 3.3] it is shown that an equivalent characterization is that there exists a finite dense subset in this space. Again, using the standard argument (taking complements, similarly as for compact spaces) we get that this condition is equivalent to: Every system of open sets which has finite intersection property has non-empty intersection. I'll try to show that the following three conditions are equivalent: (a) Every system of open subsets of $X$ which has finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection. (b) Every open filter on $X$ has a non-empty intersection. (c) Every open ultrafilter on $X$ has a non-empty intersection. By definition, an open filter has f.i.p. Hence (a) $\Rightarrow$ (b). It is clear that (b) $\Rightarrow$ (c). $\boxed{\text{(c)}\Rightarrow\text{(a)}}$ If $\mathscr S$ is a system of open sets with f.i.p. then (by Zorn lemma) there exists an open ultrafilter $\mathscr F\supseteq\mathscr S$ . Since $\mathscr F$ has non-empty intersection, so does $\mathscr S$ . So we get that the notions of u.i. spaces and f.i. spaces are equivalent to the notion of strongly S-closed spaces. (Which basically answers my first two questions. But I am still keeping these two questions in my post - it is still possible that I have made a mistake in my proof, and also it is still possible that this class of spaces was studied under a different name or someone will be able to contribute some other interesting facts about such spaces.) As pointed out in a (now deleted) comment by Niels Diepeveen , $T_1$ -spaces have this property if and only if they are finite. (Closed cover by singletons has to have a finite subcover.) c.o.i. and c.b.i. are not equivalent conditions. As an example we can take an infinite discrete space. The base consisting of all singletons has the property described above. So far we see that f.i $\Leftrightarrow$ u.i. $\Rightarrow$ c.o.i $\Rightarrow$ c.b.i. Background, motivation, related notions u.i.-spaces are Baire spaces. These classes of spaces caught my attention after I have seen the following result 2 , which says that every u.i.-space is Baire: Proposition. If there are no free open ultrafilters on a space $X$ , then $X$ is a Baire space . After seeing this result I asked myself what the spaces where this condition is fulfilled look like. (It seems a reasonable question to ask about spaces fulfilling the assumptions of a result you see published somewhere.) c.b.i. spaces are $\alpha$ -favorable. The classes of c.o.i. and c.b.i. are also related to Baire spaces. It can be shown that in c.b.i. the second player has a winning tactic for Choquet game. Choquet game can be used to characterize Baire spaces, they are precisely the spaces where the first player does not have a winning strategy 3 (or, equivalently, the first player does not have a winning tactic 4 ). It is relatively easy to see that every c.b.i. space is $\alpha$ -favorable. (And every $\alpha$ -favorable space is a Baire space.) The tactic (stationary strategy) for the second player in Choquet game is easily obtained using the base with the c.b.i. property. If the first player plays some non-empty open sets $V_i$ , the second player can choose a non-empty basic sets $U_i\subseteq V_i$ . The property of the base $\mathcal B$ formulated in the definition of c.b.i. space implies that second player always wins, if he plays in this way. Some other related properties. Some similar properties are studied if we require non-empty intersection of closures of the open sets from a filter/countable decreasing system. The spaces such that $\bigcap_{U\in\mathscr F} \overline U\ne\emptyset$ for each open filter $\mathscr F$ are called generalized absolutely closed spaces or almost compact spaces . If we add $T_2$ , we get precisely H-minimal spaces. A space which is quasi-regular has a base $\mathcal B$ such that $\bigcap_{U\in\mathcal U} \overline U\ne\emptyset$ for any countable system $\mathcal U\subseteq\mathcal B$ with finite intersection property is called countably base compact . (Although this property does not seem to appear too often , more references can be found for base compact spaces , where the countability condition is omitted.) The extension $sX$ . One of the spaces studied in [HM, Section IV.2] is the space called $sX$ , which is constructed from $X$ as follows: We add to $X$ as new points the set $F$ of all open ultrafilters, that are generated by countable systems of open sets $\{U_n; n=1,2,\dots\}$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2 \supseteq \dots$ and $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i=\emptyset$ . We take the topology given by the base consisting of sets $U^*=U\cup\{\mathfrak F\in F; U\in\mathfrak F\}$ . It is shown that $sX$ is a Baire space which contains $X$ as a dense subspace and also some other results about this space are mentioned there. Clearly a space $X$ is an c.o.i. space if and only if $sX=X$ . (But this is more of a reformulation than a characterization.) The reasons I am mentioning $sX$ is that it is an example of a c.b.i. space. (And so are some other extensions mentioned in that chapter.) Suppose we have basic sets $U_1^*\supseteq U_2^* \supseteq U_3 \supseteq \dots$ . We can assume that $U_1\supseteq U_2 \supseteq U_3 \supseteq \dots$ . (If not, we simply take $U_n' = \bigcap_{k=1}^n U_k$ . This does not change the decreasing system of basic sets, since $(U\cap V)^*=U^*\cap V^*$ and the same is true for any finite intersection.) Then there are two possibilities. If $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i\ne\emptyset$ , then also the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i^*$ is non-empty. On the other hand, if $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i=\emptyset$ , then the filter $\mathfrak F$ generated by $\{U_i; i=1,2,\dots\}$ is a point of $sX$ which belongs to $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i^*$ .

The problem, as Brian explains, is that a connected linearly ordered space with endpoints is compact, so the continuous image of such a space is also compact and connected. This is a problem, because: No compact, connected subset of the topologist’s sine curve contains the origin and at least one other point of the curve, and There exist countably infinite connected Hausdorff spaces, and there are no paths between distinct points in such a space; because if such a path existed, its image would be a compact countably infinite connected Hausdorff space with at least two points, and no such space exist.

Moreover, for any non-T1 space isn't there a quotient map to a T1 space, just using the equivalence relation ""two points are equivalent if they are topologically equivalent, ie share the same neighborhood system""? (This might even be a homeomorphism?) Why isn't T1 the fourth topological axiom? In fact, I believe I saw one author use it as such. In any case I don't see any motivation to consider spaces which don't satisfy the axiom. Am I correct in this? EDIT: Uh-oh. I thought that Kolmogorov/T0 was the same thing as T1 (i.e. I forgot that there exists something in between Hausdorff and ""all points topologically indistinguishable""). Should I vote to close this question since it was based on a false premise? I am interested in the reasons for studying T0 and not T1 spaces, so on one hand I do want to leave it open. On the other hand, what I was really confused about is why we shouldn't reduce all non-T0 spaces to T0 spaces using the above mentioned equivalence relation, and thus why anyone would study non-T0 spaces?

But I have never heard of any non-T1 (not Kolmogorov, points may not be closed) space which is useful. Moreover, for any non-T1 space isn't there a quotient map to a T1 space, just using the equivalence relation ""two points are equivalent if they are topologically equivalent, ie share the same neighborhood system""? (This might even be a homeomorphism?) Why isn't T1 the fourth topological axiom? In fact, I believe I saw one author use it as such. In any case I don't see any motivation to consider spaces which don't satisfy the axiom. Am I correct in this? EDIT: Uh-oh. I thought that Kolmogorov/T0 was the same thing as T1 (i.e. I forgot that there exists something in between Hausdorff and ""all points topologically indistinguishable""). Should I vote to close this question since it was based on a false premise? I am interested in the reasons for studying T0 and not T1 spaces, so on one hand I do want to leave it open.
