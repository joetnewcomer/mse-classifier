1,$S^3$ as union of 2 solid tori,as union of 2 solid tori,S^3,"I am working through Hatcher's Algebraic Topology and don't get what he means by ""standard decomposition of $S^3$ into two solid tori"", $$S^3= S^1 \times D^2 \cup D^2 \times S^1$$ Can someone explain (or visualize) what the union looks like? First, I thought it looked like a genus- $2$ -torus: but I guess that's not what he means, actually... I have basic knowledge in algebraic topology and I am not familiar with Heegaard Splittings. To obtain an embedding of $X$ in $S^3-K$ as a deformation retract we will use the standard decomposition of $S^3$ into two solid tori $S^1\times D^2$ and $D^2\times S^1$ , the results of regarding $S^2$ as $\delta D^4=\delta(D^2\times D^2)=\delta D^2\times D^2\cup D^2\times\delta D^2$ . Geometrically, the first solid torus $S^1\times D^2$ can be identified with the compact region in $\Bbb R^3$ bounded by the standard torus $S^1\times S^1$ containing $K$ , and the second solid torus $D^2\times S^1$ is then the closure of the complement of the first solid torus, together with the compactification point at infinity. Notice that meridional circles in $S^1\times S^1$ bound disks in the first solid torus, while it is longitudinal circles that bound disks in the second solid torus.

43,Curvature and the Arrow Pratt Absolute Risk Coefficient,Curvature and the Arrow Pratt Absolute Risk Coefficient,,"So I'm in my first year of grad school, and I'm taking a decision analysis course. One of the topics we're covering is risk aversion, and with that comes discussion of the Arrow Pratt Absolute Risk Aversion coefficient. I know that this coefficient is supposed to be a measure of the curvature of an individual's utility function; however, using the little bit I remember from differential geometry, the Arrow Pratt coefficient definitely is not equal to the standard geometric definition of curvature. My question is: how are the two definitions related? function definitions $u(x)$: this functions takes in a vector $x \in R^{n}$ and spits out a value $u(x) \in R$ $r(x)= \frac{-u''(x)}{u'(x)}$  (risk coefficient) $k(x) = \frac{|u'(x)|}{(1+(u'(x))^{2})^{3/2}}$ In class, we've been using utility functions that have a constant absolute risk version coefficient. So, I used the one given in class when toying around in Matlab. This function is: $u(x)=(\frac 4 3)(1-(1/2)^{x/50})$ Thus, $u'(x)= \frac {-(2*(1/2)^{x/50}\ln(1/2))}{75}$ $u''(x)= \frac{-((1/2)^{x/50}log(1/2)^2}{1875}$ And we have: $r(x) = \frac{-\ln(1/2)}{50}$ However, curvature is: $k(x) = \frac{1}{((4(\frac12)^{x/25}\frac{log(1/2)^2}{5625} + 1)^{3/2}} = \frac{1}{(.00034166(\frac12)^{x/50}+1)^{3/2}}$ So, clearly this line does not have constant curvature by the geometric definition. This is also obvious when looking at a graph of $u(x)$. So, I'm struggling to relate the two measures. Is Arrow-Pratt discussing the relationship between slope and curvature?

If this is always true, I assume that this a know fact [otherwise I have my first theorem! :-) erm conjecture, since I can't prove it :-(  ]. What's the theorem called?
