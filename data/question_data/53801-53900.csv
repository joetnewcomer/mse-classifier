2,Using residues to evaluate a sum involving the square of $\text{csch}$,Using residues to evaluate a sum involving the square of,\text{csch},"I have been trying to evaluate the following sum using residues: $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sinh^{2}(\pi  n)}=\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{2\pi}$$ I am mainly interested in using residues to do this.  I can do it using real methods. I tried using $\displaystyle \oint\frac{\pi\cot(\pi z)}{\sinh^{2}(\pi z)}dz$ The residue at $z=0$ is $\frac{-2}{3}$ The residue at $\displaystyle z=n, \;\ (n=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, ....)$ is $\displaystyle \lim_{z\to n}\frac{(z-n)\cos(\pi z)}{\sin(\pi z)\sinh^{2}(\pi z)}=\frac{1}{\sinh^{2}(\pi n)}$ The residue at $\displaystyle z=ni, \;\ (\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, .....)$ is $\displaystyle \lim_{z\to ni}\frac{(z-ni)\pi\cot(\pi z)}{\sinh^{2}(\pi z)}=\frac{1}{\sinh^{2}(\pi n)}$ So, by the residue theorem: $\displaystyle \oint\frac{\pi \cot(\pi z)}{\sinh^{2}(\pi z)}dz=\frac{-2}{3}+4\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{\sinh^{2}(\pi n)}$ As $N\to \infty$, the left side goes to 0, then solve for the sum at hand. It would appear the 1/6 is in there, but I have failed to arrive at the correct solution. Where does the $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ come into play?. No doubt, I am doing it incorrectly. Can someone point me in the right direction?

7,The rational function $\tan\left(n\arctan x\right)$,The rational function,\tan\left(n\arctan x\right),"While messing around with the formula $$\arctan x+\arctan y=\arctan\frac{x+y}{1-xy},\tag1$$ I decided to iteratively find expressions for $n\arctan x$ by applying the formula $(1)$ $n$ times. I was able to reach $n=9$ before it got too annoying.

There are clearly some patterns going on here. Taking $R_n(x)=\tan(n\arctan x)=p_n(x)/q_n(x),$ we can explore some of them. Firstly, it is easy to see that $$\arctan R_{n+1}(x)=(n+1)\arctan x=n\arctan x +\arctan x\\ =\arctan R_n(x)+\arctan x=\arctan\frac{x+R_n(x)}{1-xR_n(x)},$$ so that $$R_{n+1}(x)=\frac{x+R_n(x)}{1-xR_n(x)}=\frac{xq_n(x)+p_n(x)}{q_n(x)-xp_n(x)}.$$ From this, it is clear to see that $x|p_n(x)$ for all $n\ge1$ , as $$x|p_n(x)\Rightarrow x|(xq_n(x)-p_n(x))\Rightarrow x|p_{n+1}(x).$$ Furthermore, the relation $p_n(1/x)=(-1)^{\tfrac{n-1}{2}}x^{-n}q_n(x)$ is satisfied by the cases $n=3,5,7,9$ . Similarly, the relations $p_n(1/x)=(-1)^{\tfrac{n}2-1}x^{-n}p_n(x)$ and $q_n(1/x)=(-1)^{n/2}q_n(x)$ are satisfied by $n=2,4,6,8$ . Put more simply, $$\begin{align} R_2(1/x)&=-R_2(x), &R_3(1/x)&=1/R_3(x),\\ R_4(1/x)&=-R_4(x), &R_5(1/x)&=1/R_5(x),\\ R_6(1/x)&=-R_6(x), &R_7(1/x)&=1/R_7(x),\\ R_8(1/x)&=-R_8(x), &R_9(1/x)&=1/R_9(x).\\ \end{align}$$ Indeed, this pattern can be shown to continue. Specifically, if we suppose that $R_{2k}(1/x)=-R_{2k}(x)$ for some $k\ge1$ , then $$R_{2k+1}(\tfrac1x)=\frac{\tfrac1x+R_{2k}(\tfrac1x)}{1-\tfrac1x R_{2k}(\tfrac1x)}=\frac{\tfrac1x-R_{2k}(x)}{1+\tfrac1x R_{2k}(x)}=\frac{1-xR_{2k}(x)}{x+R_{2k}(x)}=\frac{1}{R_{2k+1}(x)}.$$ Similarly, if $R_{2k-1}(1/x)=1/R_{2k-1}(x)$ for some $k\ge1$ , we get $$R_{2k}(\tfrac1x)=\frac{\tfrac1x+R_{2k-1}(\tfrac1x)}{1-\tfrac1xR_{2k-1}(\tfrac1x)}=\frac{\tfrac1x+\tfrac1{R_{2k-1}(x)}}{1-\tfrac1{xR_{2k-1}(x)}}=\frac{R_{2k-1}(x)+x}{xR_{2k-1}(x)-1}=-R_{2k}(x).$$ Another thing we may notice is the following. Here I will abbreviate $R_s(x)$ as $R_s$ for simplicity. $$\arctan R_{n+m}=(n+m)\arctan x=n\arctan x+m\arctan x=\arctan R_n+\arctan R_m=\arctan\frac{R_n+R_m}{1-R_nR_m}.$$ That is $$R_{n+m}(x)=\frac{R_n(x)+R_m(x)}{1-R_n(x)R_m(x)},$$ and consequentially $$\frac{p_{n+m}(x)}{q_{n+m}(x)}=\frac{p_n(x)q_m(x)+p_m(x)q_n(x)}{q_n(x)q_m(x)-p_n(x)p_m(x)}.$$ These are some pretty remarkable identities, so I can't possibly be the only person to consider these rational functions. Do they have a name? A generating function? A general closed form (other than $\tan(n\arctan x)$ and similar)?

Here the sign as well as order of summands matters. Also by convention we set $r_{2}(0) = 1$. Bruce C. Berndt and George E. Andrews mention the following surprising result of Ramanujan related to $r_{2}(n)$ in their book ""Ramanujan's Lost Notebook Vol 4"" (page 10): $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{r_{2}(n)}{\sqrt{n + a}}e^{-2\pi\sqrt{(n + a)b}} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{r_{2}(n)}{\sqrt{n + b}}e^{-2\pi\sqrt{(n + b)a}}\tag{1}$$ where $a, b$ are positive real numbers. It is further mentioned that this formula was referred in a paper (""On the expression of a number as the sum of two squares"", Quart. J. Math. (Oxford)46(1915), 263–283.) by G. H. Hardy and was not seen anywhere in any of Ramanujan's published/unpublished work. Like Ramanujan Berndt / Andrews also don't provide the proof in their book. The only detail I know about $r_{2}(n)$ is its generating function $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}r_{2}(n)q^{n} = \vartheta_{3}^{2}(q) = \left(\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}q^{n^{2}}\right)^{2} = 1 + 4\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{q^{n}}{1 + q^{2n}}\tag{2}$$ (see this post ) from which it is possible to find a direct formula for $r_{2}(n)$ based on count of divisors of $n$ of type $(4m + 1)$ and of type $(4m + 3)$. On the other hand the formula $(1)$ seems to based on some formula related to the sum $$\sum r_{2}(n)e^{-2\pi\sqrt{(n + a)b}}$$ and then taking its derivative with respect to $a$ to get $$-b\pi\sum \frac{r_{2}(n)}{\sqrt{(n + a)b}}e^{-2\pi\sqrt{(n + a)b}}$$ But when I try to integrate RHS of $(1)$ with respect to $a$ it leads to nowhere.

With containing I mean that the run of digits of the base-10 representation of $x$ is present in the base-10 representation of $F_n$. For example: for $x = 32$, the first Fibonacci number containing $32$ is the $30^{th}$: $832040$. The question is, is there a solution for any $x$?",,"['sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

30,A formula of Ramanujan for $\cot\sqrt {w\alpha} \coth\sqrt{w\beta} $,A formula of Ramanujan for,\cot\sqrt {w\alpha} \coth\sqrt{w\beta} ,"While trying to answer this question I stumbled on a paper by Bruce C. Berndt which contains the following formula by Ramanujan $$\frac{\pi}{2}\cot\sqrt{w\alpha}\coth\sqrt{w\beta}=\frac{1}{2w}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{m\alpha\coth m\alpha} {w+m^2\alpha} +\frac{m\beta\coth m\beta} {w-m^2\beta} \right) \tag{1}$$ which is supposed to hold for all positive numbers $\alpha, \beta$ with $\alpha\beta=\pi^2$ . Berndt mentions that this formula is wrong and missing a term. The corrected version stands as $$\frac{\pi}{2}\cot\sqrt{w\alpha}\coth\sqrt{w\beta}=\frac{1}{2w}+\frac{1}{2}\log\frac{\beta}{\alpha}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{m\alpha\coth m\alpha} {w+m^2\alpha} +\frac{m\beta\coth m\beta} {w-m^2\beta} \right) \tag{2}$$ for $\alpha>0<\beta,\alpha\beta=\pi^2$ . Bruce gives some references which contain a proof of the above formula or its equivalents. Bruce himself derives the above identity by using a change of variables in the following identity established by R. Sitaramchandrarao $$\pi^2xy\cot (\pi x) \coth (\pi y) =1+\frac{\pi^2}{3}(y^2-x^2)-2\pi xy\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{y^2\coth (\pi n x/y)} {n(n^2+y^2)}-\frac{x^2\coth(\pi n y/x)}{n(n^2-x^2)}\right) \tag{3}$$ Ramanujan gave a similar (but wrong) formula and Sitaramachandrarao fixed it to arrive at $(3)$ . The derivation of $(2)$ from $(3)$ is not that difficult. The RHS of $(3)$ is modified using the identities $$\frac{y^2} {n(n^2+y^2)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{n}{n^2+y^2},\frac{x^2}{n(n^2-x^2)}=\frac{n}{n^2-x^2}-\frac{1}{n}$$ and $$\coth z =1+\frac{2}{e^{2z}-1}$$ The derivation also involves a transformation formula for logarithm of Dedekind eta function. However the proof of $(3)$ is omitted in Berndt's paper. Unfortunately I have not been able to find those references online which contain a proof for $(2)$ or $(3)$ . It is also mentioned that the formula could be proved using Mittag-Leffler expansion but I am barely a novice in complex analysis.

Maybe it is relevant to point out that $$ \color{green}{\sum_{m\geq 1}\frac{H_{m}^{(2)}}{(2m+1)^2}} = -\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\text{Li}_2(z^2)}{1-z^2}\log(z)\,dz.\tag{D}$$ Do you see a way to tackle the last series, or the original one through a different approach?

This is always defined; if ever $z_{n+1}=-1$ , then $$-(1+\sqrt{z_n}^2)=2\sqrt{z_n}$$ $$0=(1+\sqrt{z_n})^2$$ which implies $\sqrt{z_n}=-1$ , a contradiction. So $z_n\neq-1$ for any $n$ .

But of course if $z_n=0$ exactly, then $z_{n+1}=0$ and it converges trivially.

I tried to turn it into a differential equation, but I don't know if I've done it correctly, and how the solution to the ODE relates to the original problem: $$x_{n+1}-x_n=-\frac{a}{3^{2n+1}x_n}$$ $$\frac{df(t)}{dt}=-\frac{b}{3^{2t} f(t)}$$ $$\frac{1}{2} f^2=\frac{b}{2\ln 3} 3^{-2t}+C$$ $$f(t)=\sqrt{\frac{a}{3\ln 3} 3^{-2t}+C}$$ If I set: $$x_n=\sqrt{\frac{a}{3\ln 3} 3^{-2n}+C}$$ I get: $$C=x_0^2-\frac{a}{3\ln 3}$$ $$\lim_{n \to \infty}x_n=\sqrt{C}=\sqrt{x_0^2-\frac{a}{3\ln 3}}$$ But that's not correct. Does this work only with linear recurrences? I have also inverted the recurrence: $$x_n=\frac{1}{2} \left(x_{n+1}+\sqrt{x_{n+1}^2+\frac{4a}{3^{2n+1}}} \right)$$ This works correctly, but I'm not sure how it may help.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'recurrence-relations', 'asymptotics']"

Now, I claim that there must be a $n$ such that $$x+1-a_n(x)<\epsilon$$, and if that is true then $$a_n(x)>x+1-\epsilon=l(x)$$ which is a contradiction since $$l(x)=\sup_{n}a_n(x)$$ and then it implies that $$l(x)=x+1$$ To prove my claim it requires $$x+1-a_n(x) <  \epsilon$$ Now, \begin{align} x+1-a_n(x) = & x+1-\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} \\ \ =& \frac{(x+1)^2-({1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)})}{x+1+\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} } \\ \ =& x\frac{(x+1)+1-a_{n-1}(x+1)}{x+1+\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} } \\ \ <& \frac{x}{x+2}((x+1)+1-a_{n-1}(x+1))\\ \ <& \frac{x}{x+2}\cdot\frac{x+1}{x+3}((x+2)+1-a_{n-2}(x+2))\\ \ <& \frac{x}{x+n-1}\cdot \frac{x+1}{x+n} ((x+n-1)+1-a_{1}(x+n-1))\\ \ <& \frac{x}{x+n-1}\cdot \frac{x+1}{x+n}(x+n-\sqrt{x+n})\\ \ <& \frac{x(x+1)}{x+n-1} \end{align} Now, if one is able to find $n$ such that $$\frac{x(x+1)}{x+n-1}<\epsilon \Rightarrow x< \frac{-(1-\epsilon)+\sqrt{(1-\epsilon)^2+4\epsilon(n-1)}}{2}$$ then we're done.

Then $T=\sum\limits_{n=2}^\infty f(n)=\sum\limits_{n=2}^\infty \frac{2}{n^2-1}=\frac32$ by telescoping.

So the sum of squares of reciprocals of the green numbers is between $0$ and $\left(\frac{67}{84}\right)^2\approx 0.6361961451$ .

Our equation can be rewritten as $$ f(x)=\epsilon,\qquad \text{ where }\qquad f(x)\equiv\frac{1-x^3}{x}, $$ and the unperturbed equation reads $f(1)=0$; then $$\boxed{ x(\epsilon)= 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{g_n}{n!}\epsilon^n } $$ and the coefficients are given by  $$\begin{aligned} g_n &= \lim_{x\to 1}\left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1}\left(\frac{x-1}{f(x)}\right)^n\\ &=(-1)^n \left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^{n-1} \left(\frac{x}{1+x+x^2}\right)^n_{x=1}\\ &=(-1)^n \left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1} \left(\frac{t+1}{3+3t+t^2}\right)^n_{t=0}. \end{aligned}$$ To calculate these derivatives, let us expand the functions appearing on the right-hand side as follows using the geometric series expansion for small $t$ and Newton's binomial formula: $$\begin{aligned} \left(\frac{t+1}{3+3t+t^2}\right)^n &=\frac{(t+1)^n}{3^n}\frac{1}{\left[1+\left(t+\dfrac{t^2}{3}\right)\right]^n}\\ &=\frac{(t+1)^n}{3^n}\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \binom{n-1+k}{k} \left(t+\frac{t^2}{3}\right)^k\\ &=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \sum_{i=0}^k \sum_{j=0}^n \frac{(-1)^k}{3^{n+i}}\binom{n+k-1}{k}\binom{k}{i}\binom{n}{j}t^{k+i+j}. \end{aligned}$$ Now the differentiation is easy: $$ \left(\frac{d}{dt}\right)^{n-1}t^{k+i+j}\bigg|_{t=0}=\frac{(k+i+j)!}{(k+i+j-n+1)!}\delta_{k+i+j,n-1}. $$ We can use the Kronecker delta to get rid of the summation over $j$: we set $j=n-1-i-k$ as long as this value falls within the summation range $$ 0\le n-1-i-k \le n $$ which in turn imposes $i\le n-1-k$ and $k\le n-1$. After a few algebraic simplifications,  $$\boxed{ g_n=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-k}(n-1+k)!\sum_{i=0}^{\min(k,n-1-k)}\binom{n}{1+k+i}\frac{1}{3^{n+i}i!(k-i)!}. } $$ Is there a way to compute the radius of convergence of the above series? A rough estimate is given by plugging $k,i\mapsto n/2$ which radius $\rho=2$, but surely a more refined analysis is possible. Numerical evaluations of $1/\lim |g_n/n!|^{1/n}$ suggest that the convergence radius should be strictly less than $2$.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'recurrence-relations', 'roots', 'perturbation-theory']"

Sum Parameters: -If 1 is reached at an exact given point, the sum stops and thus making the sum finite. -The sum must be $\le $ 1 -All terms must be the reciprocal of composite numbers. -To find the next term in the list, you must find the largest reciprocal (that fits standards) that makes the sum $\le$ 1, and NOT the term that best fits the sum. For example, if you were to need to add $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{y}$ to make the sum exactly 1, but $\frac{1}{a}$ was the largest and still fit the rest of the parameters, then you would have to stick with with $\frac{1}{a}$. (Even if $\frac{1}{a}$ was a really ugly term to add at that point) Questions: 1) With these rules in place will the sum be a finite or infinite sum? If this is an infinite sum than the terms will always get closer and closer to 1, but never actually get there with a finite number of terms.

What I call double sequence is a function from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ . By opposition to this, I call simple sequence (just a regular sequence), a function $\mathbb{N}  \to \mathbb{R}$ . Recursion relation I learnt that for a simple sequence , there are methods for solving recursion definitions of a sequence. For example, the simple function $u(n)$ defined as $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, u(n+1)= u(n)+ u(n-1)$ , we solve the characteristic polynomial associated with this recursion relation, and we find that the space of solution $S$ is the span of the Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ and Lucas numbers $L_n$ : $S\in Span(F_n,L_n)=Vect(F_n,L_n)$ . My problem However, I have some interests in double sequences $u(i,j)$ defined by a recursion relation so that $\forall (i,j)\in \mathbb{N}^2,u(i,j) = f_1(i,j) \cdot u(i,j-1) + f_2(i,j) \cdot u(i-1,j-1)$ , with the first term $u(0,0)$ being equal to a real constant, let's say $u(0,0) = \alpha$ ; and that $\forall (i,j)\in \mathbb{Z}^2, (i<0 \vee j<0),u(i,j) = 0$ so the terms with negative index in the recursion relation cancels out nicely. A change of variable? Someone suggested me to perform a change of variable so that we get a double sequence $v(i,j)$ with the form $\forall (i,j)\in \mathbb{N}^2,v(i,j) = g_1(i,j) \cdot v(i,j-1) + g_2(i,j) \cdot v(i-1,j)$ .

Is there a matrix representation of this system that could be used to compute this? Edit due to Yuval Filmus' comment Edit: The comment turned out to be a little bit helpful with the user named Yuval Filmus telling me about generating functions and linking this book . Basically the idea of this clue is to replace the study of $u(i,j)$ by the study of $\sum \sum u(i,j) x^i y^j$ ; then, you replace the terms with partial derivatives as described on the book, and you turn your recursion problem in a PDE problem . However, I the problem is that the functions $g_1$ and $g_2$ are polynomials of order 2, and I don't know how to make it appear. So I would like to know if someone could explicitly turn my problem in a PDE problem then solve it? Then, once the function $\sum \sum u(i,j) x^i y^j$ has been found, you just do the do product with the family of functions $x^i$ and $y^j$ to get $u(i,j)$ .

If it's been solved, I'd love to see the paper. There is a method by Paulhus for packing infinite fractional squares into a rectangle. We can start with a rectangle with an area slightly greater than all the fractional squares.  $$\sum\limits_{a=2}^\infty \frac{1}{a^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}-1 \approx 0.644934067 \approx 0.644934069 \approx \frac{545}{467} \times \frac{21}{38}$$ His coding method seems to work very well, as seen below.

95,Number of directional orders for $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$?,Number of directional orders for  points in ?,n \mathbb{R}^d,"Imagine there is some set $X$ of $n$ points (different) in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The number of (linear) orders we could define for them is just $n!\approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n$. Some of these orders can be defined alongside some direction: by projection on some unitary vector $v$: we take scalar products $(v\cdot x^i)_{i=1..n}$ for all these points and use the natural order for these real numbers. It defines an interesting equivalence relation on the sphere of directions: $v\sim_X u$ iff they define the same order in $X$. Such regions should be connected (and ""convex""?). Let's discard their boundaries, which are generic situations: take only directions for which projections of all points are pairwise different. The question is what is the number of such directional orders e.g. for a $d$-dimensional cube? Upper bound? Probability distribution for points of random positions? If all points are in one line, there are just 2 different directional orders  (the regions are two half-spheres). So the main question is upper bound - denote the maximal number of directional orders as $M_{n,d}$. Some obvious values are $M_{n,1}=2$, or for $d\geq n-1$ we have simplex: $M_{n,d}=n!$. Is there a general formula for $M_{n,d}$? Recurrence? Update: just made some numerics in Mathematica for $M_{n,d}$, (e.g.:  ""MatrixForm[Table[x = RandomReal[1, {n, d}];   CountDistinct[Table[v = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, d]; Ordering[x.v], {i, 100000}]], {n,10}, {d, 10}]]""). For $d=2$ and $n=1,\ldots,10$, we get looking certain: 1,2,6 , 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90 ... which can be guessed: $M_{n,2}=n(n-1)$ with exception of $M_{1,2}=1$. This formula suggests that we can choose e.g. first two vertices and the rest follow, but it's more complicated. For $d=3$ we get: 1,2,6,24 , 72, 172?, 352?, 642?, 1072?, 1690? (the last ones may be still increased - tested 10 sets for million directions) - the first four are factorials, but I don't see a formula for the following? For $d=4$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120 , 480, ~1404, ~3488, ~7516, ~14374. For $d=5$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720 ,3600, ~10500, ~29000, ~62000. For $d=6$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720,5040 , 30240?, ~70000, ~260000. Numerics suggest that the number varies among different sets of points with random positions, leading to further questions e.g. of characterization of sets of points maximizing the number of directional orders? Update: Searching just below diagonal might be helpful, e.g. ""adding one point to simplex"": $M_{n,n-2}=(n-1)!\cdot(n-2) $ checked for $n=3,4,5,6,7$ ... (?) Update: For cubes ($n=2^d$) and dimensions 1,2,3,4, the number of directional orders is correspondingly: 1, 8, 96, 5376. Update: We can tell a lot about boundaries of the regions. E.g. generic $d$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ form unique hyperplane, and its $\pm$normal directions are two vertices of the boundary between $d!$ regions of equivalence of $\sim_X$ relation: with infinitesimal perturbation we can choose any order among these $d$ points. Analogously $d-1$ points define lines at the boundary - between $(d-1)!$ regions. For such boundary as CW-complex , we would like to apply general Euler formula : $$1-(-1)^d=\chi=k_0-k_1+k_2-\ldots-(-1)^d k_{d-1}$$ where $k_0$ is the number of vertices, $k_1$ edges and so on, finally allowing to calculate the number of our regions/orders as $k_{d-1}$.

For $k_1$ we choose $d-1$ vertices in ${n\choose d-1}$ ways - plane going through them defines 1D circle on the sphere. Projecting on two dimensional space orthogonal to such plane, these $d-1$ points become one point there, getting situation with $n-d+2$ points in 2D. Hence, the total number of arcs seems $k_1={n\choose d-1}M_{n-d+2,2}$ (?). Analogously $k_i={n\choose d-i} M_{n-d+1+i,1+i}$ (?), what also agrees for $k_0$, and allows to get recurrence thanks to Euler formula: $$M_{n,d}=^?(-1)^d \left((-1)^d-1 +\sum_{i=0}^{d-2} (-1)^i {n\choose d-i} M_{n-d+1+i,1+i}  \right) $$ Unverified - I will probably go back to it in a few days.","Imagine there is some set $X$ of $n$ points (different) in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The number of (linear) orders we could define for them is just $n!\approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n$. Some of these orders can be defined alongside some direction: by projection on some unitary vector $v$: we take scalar products $(v\cdot x^i)_{i=1..n}$ for all these points and use the natural order for these real numbers. It defines an interesting equivalence relation on the sphere of directions: $v\sim_X u$ iff they define the same order in $X$. Such regions should be connected (and ""convex""?). Let's discard their boundaries, which are generic situations: take only directions for which projections of all points are pairwise different. The question is what is the number of such directional orders e.g. for a $d$-dimensional cube? Upper bound? Probability distribution for points of random positions? If all points are in one line, there are just 2 different directional orders  (the regions are two half-spheres). So the main question is upper bound - denote the maximal number of directional orders as $M_{n,d}$. Some obvious values are $M_{n,1}=2$, or for $d\geq n-1$ we have simplex: $M_{n,d}=n!$. Is there a general formula for $M_{n,d}$? Recurrence? Update: just made some numerics in Mathematica for $M_{n,d}$, (e.g.:  ""MatrixForm[Table[x = RandomReal[1, {n, d}];   CountDistinct[Table[v = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, d]; Ordering[x.v], {i, 100000}]], {n,10}, {d, 10}]]""). For $d=2$ and $n=1,\ldots,10$, we get looking certain: 1,2,6 , 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90 ... which can be guessed: $M_{n,2}=n(n-1)$ with exception of $M_{1,2}=1$. This formula suggests that we can choose e.g. first two vertices and the rest follow, but it's more complicated. For $d=3$ we get: 1,2,6,24 , 72, 172?, 352?, 642?, 1072?, 1690? (the last ones may be still increased - tested 10 sets for million directions) - the first four are factorials, but I don't see a formula for the following? For $d=4$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120 , 480, ~1404, ~3488, ~7516, ~14374. For $d=5$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720 ,3600, ~10500, ~29000, ~62000. For $d=6$ we get: 1,2,6,24,120,720,5040 , 30240?, ~70000, ~260000. Numerics suggest that the number varies among different sets of points with random positions, leading to further questions e.g. of characterization of sets of points maximizing the number of directional orders? Update: Searching just below diagonal might be helpful, e.g. ""adding one point to simplex"": $M_{n,n-2}=(n-1)!\cdot(n-2) $ checked for $n=3,4,5,6,7$ ... (?) Update: For cubes ($n=2^d$) and dimensions 1,2,3,4, the number of directional orders is correspondingly: 1, 8, 96, 5376. Update: We can tell a lot about boundaries of the regions. E.g. generic $d$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ form unique hyperplane, and its $\pm$normal directions are two vertices of the boundary between $d!$ regions of equivalence of $\sim_X$ relation: with infinitesimal perturbation we can choose any order among these $d$ points.
