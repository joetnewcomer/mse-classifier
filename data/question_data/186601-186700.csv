1,Monotonicity of function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2}-\sqrt[3]{x^2}$,Monotonicity of function,f(x)=\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2}-\sqrt[3]{x^2},"I'm examining the properties of the function $$f(x)=\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2}-\sqrt[3]{x^2}$$ and I'm stuck at monotonicity. I know that monotonicity depends from first derivative (if first derivative is grater, equal or lower than zero). So I found the first derivative and got $$f'(x)=\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}\right)$$  and I know it's correct. Now I need the zeroes of the derivative so I can see important points where monotonicty potentially changes. When I try to find zeroes I get: $$\frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}\right)=0$$ $$\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}=0$$ $$\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x+1}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}$$ $$x+1=x$$ which makes no sense...

To this end, we first count the number of sets $B \subseteq A$, with $|B| = n$, and multiply this by the number of onto functions $f \colon A \to B$. This results in the following formula: $$\binom{m}{n}n!{m\brace n}\;.$$ We can now write the following identity: $$m^m = \sum_{n=1}^{m}\binom{m}{n}n!{m\brace n}\;,$$ where $m^m$ is the total number of functions $f \colon A \to A$. Motivation: Let $A$ be a set of size $m$. Pick a random function $g$ from the set $F = \{f \colon A \to A\}$. Let $X_m = \frac{|\text{range}(g)|}{m}$. What is $E[X_m]$? Example: Let $A = \{a,b\}$.

How does one resolve this?","This question already has answers here : It's in my hands to have a surjective function (3 answers) Closed 11 years ago . A function is a type of relation.  That is, a function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ is a subset of $X \times Y$  where for each $x \in X$, there is exactly one $y \in Y$ such that $(x, y) \in f$.  Suppose $Y \subsetneq Y'$ and $g: X \to Y'$ is defined by $g(x) = f(x)$.  Since functions are sets, and sets are completely determined by there elements $f = g$.  However, $f$ can be surjective while $g$ is not, and in that case, $f \ne g$. How does one resolve this?",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

Sorry for the confusion.","What is the domain of ? Is it all real numbers, or are negative numbers still excluded, even after the square? Edit: What I'm really wondering is whether is defined.
