(b) $G$ is said to be a Frobenius group if it has a nontrivial proper subgroup $H$ such that $N_G(H)=H$ and whenever $H^{g_1}, H^{g_2}$ are distinct conjugates of $H$ in $G$ (with $g_1, g_2\in G$), $H^{g_1}\cap H^{g_2}=1$. Any such subgroup is called a Frobenius complement in $G$. Prove the following statements: (i) $G$ has a Frobenius action on some set if and only if $G$ is a Frobenius group. (ii) If $G$ is a Frobenius group and $H$ is a Frobenius complement in $G$ then $|G:H|\equiv 1 \mod |H|$. (iii) If $G$ is a Frobenius group then $Z(G)=1$.

Then $D_{2n}$ is a Frobenius group if and only if $n$ is odd. For the first question, I think I need to use the following fact: let $X$ be a transitive $G$-space, $Y$ a transitive $H$-space. If $(G,X)\cong (H,Y)$ then for any $x\in X, y\in Y$, $\operatorname{Stab}_G(x)\cong \operatorname{Stab}_H(y)$.

From there I think I need to show that $g_1\cdot x\neq g_2\cdot x$, so that the stabilisers intersect trivially and therefore $H^{g_1}\cap H^{g_2}=1$. For the normaliser, we always have that $H\subseteq N_G(H)$, if $n\in N_G(H)$ then $nhn^{-1}\in H$ for every $h\in H$. Now, $nhn^{-1}\in \operatorname{Stab}_G(n\cdot x)$.

The claim is that if $N$ is normal in $G$, then $D^i(G/N) = (ND^i(G)/N)$. I know we should proceed by induction, and we do thus: For the base case, $i=0$, we have:          $$ D^0(G/N) = G/N \mbox{ and } (ND^0G)/N = (NG)/N$$         But from the second isomorphism theorem, $(NG)/N \cong G/(G\cap N) = G/N$, and we have equality. Now, assume that the claim holds for the $k$th term, and we will consider the $k+1$st term: $\begin{eqnarray*} 	D^{k+1}(G/N) &=& \left[ G/N, D^k(G/N) \right] \\ 	&=& [G/N, (ND^kG)/N] \\ 	&=& \langle [x, y] \mid x \in G/N, y \in (ND^kG)/N \rangle \\ 	&=& \langle xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \mid x \in G/N, y\in (ND^kG)/N \rangle \\ 	&=& \langle xyx^{-1}y^{-1}N \mid x \in G, y\in ND^kG \rangle \\ 	&=& \langle [x,y]N \mid x \in G, y\in ND^kG \rangle \\ 	&=& [G, D^kG]N \\ 	&\subseteq& (ND^{k+1}G)/N  \end{eqnarray*}$ This gives one direction of inclusion. The other direction seems similar. Is this the right approach? I feel like I've bungled the chain of equalities. In particular, I'm pretty sure I just pulled the $ND^{k+1}G$ (necessary so that so that $N$ is normal in $ND^{k+1}G$) product out of thin air. Tips, advice, corrections?

77,Cancellation of elements in the Gromov boundary of a finitely generated free group,Cancellation of elements in the Gromov boundary of a finitely generated free group,,"This question is inspired by this post from MO Let $A$ be a finite set of free generators and their inverses and $F$ the free group generated by elements in $A$ (some call $A$ the alphabet of $F$ ). For each $g\in F$ , use $\vert\,g\,\vert$ to denote the length of $g$ . The Gromov boundary of $F$ , denoted by $\partial F$ , can be viewed as the set of words that consists of letters from $A$ and has infinite length starting from the left. For instance, $a_1 a_2 \cdots $ is the general form of elements in $\partial F$ where $a_i\in A$ and $a_i a_{i+1}\neq e$ for each $i\in\mathbb{N}$ . Set $\overline{F} = F\cup\partial F$ . Given $x, y\in\overline{F}$ , if $x\neq y$ , let $x\wedge y$ denote the common part between $x$ and $y$ starting from the left. For instance: $ (a_1 \cdots a_n )\wedge (a_1 \cdots a_n b_{n+1} b_{n+2} \cdots) = a_1 \cdots a_n$ . Define a function $d: \overline{F}\times\overline{F}\rightarrow(0, 1)$ as follows: $d(x, y)=0$ if $x=y$ and $d(x, y)= \operatorname{exp}(-\vert\,x\wedge\,y\,\vert)$ . One can check $(\overline{F}, d)$ is a compact metric space and $d$ is an ultrametric. From now on, we assume $\overline{F}$ is equipped with the $d$ -metric topology. An action of $F$ on $\partial F$ can be defined as follows: given $g\in F$ and $x\in\partial F$ , $g\cdot x = gx$ (after cancellation). Given $\gamma\in\partial F$ , for each $i\in\mathbb{N}$ , let $\gamma_i$ denote the $i$ -th letter of $\gamma$ and define $[\gamma]_i = \gamma_1 \cdots \gamma_i$ . Obviously, for each $\gamma\in\partial F$ , we have $\gamma = \lim_i [\gamma]_i$ . From now on we only consider $\gamma\in\partial F$ such that $\gamma \neq \lim_n gh^n$ for any $g, h\in F$ .

After some searching, I find Wofsey's answer to be helpful, but I'm stuck at some point: (We may assume $n=p^k$ for some prime $p$ if necessary.) Since every cyclic subgroup of order $n$ of such $A$ is a direct summand, by transfinite induction, we may find a subgroup $B\subseteq A$ such that $B$ is the direct sum of copies $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and that every element of $A\backslash B$ has order less than $n$ . The author claims that $B$ is a direct summand of $A$ , but I can't find out why it holds. I think it suffices to show the following statement, but I can't go any further. Statement Let $A$ be an abelian group, and let $\{B_m\}$ , $\{C_m\}$ , $\{C_m'\}$ be subgroups  of $A$ with $m\geq 1$ , such that $B_1\oplus C_1=A$ , $C_m = C_{m+1}\oplus C_{m+1}'$ for $m\geq 1$ , $B_{m+1}=B_m\oplus C_{m+1}'$ for $m\geq 1$ . Then $\bigcup_m B_m$ is a direct summand of $A$ . Any help is appreciated. P.S. This IS my homework assignment, but I've already submitted my answer. So grade is not relevant. Edit 1: Previous statement is wrong. If we take $A=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{Z}$ , $B_m=\mathbb{Z}\times\dotsb\times\mathbb{Z}\times 0\times 0\times\dotsb$ ( $m$ copies of $\mathbb{Z}$ ), $C_m=0\times\dotsb\times 0\times\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\times\dotsb$ ( $m$ copies of $0$ ), $C_m'=0\times\dotsb\times 0\times\mathbb{Z}\times 0\times 0\times\dotsb$ ( $\mathbb{Z}$ appears as the $m$ -th term), then $\bigcup B_m=\bigoplus_{n=1}^\infty\mathbb{Z}$ is not a direct summand of $A$ according to this post .","I'm working on the part (b) of the exercise at P.67 of Brown's Cohomology of Groups, which is stated as follows: Let . Show that is an injective -module. Deduce: (a) If is an abelian group such that , and is a cyclic subgroup of order , then is a direct summand of . (b) If is as in (a), then is a direct sum of cyclic groups. There are some proofs of (b) which is irrelevant to (a), i.e. in chapter 10 of ""Fundamentals of the Theory of Groups"" by Mikhail Ivanovich Kargapolov and Ju. I. Merzljakov, though I think these are not the type of proofs that Brown wants us to provide.
