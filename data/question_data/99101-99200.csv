0,What's wrong with this reasoning? (Cauchy integral theorem),What's wrong with this reasoning? (Cauchy integral theorem),,"Asumme that $f$ is analytic and for $z\in \overline{B(x,r)}$: $$|f(z)|\leq d$$ Then for $z\in B(x,r)$: $$|f'(z)|=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left|\oint_{|\alpha-x|=r}\frac{f(\alpha)}{(\alpha-z)^2}d\alpha\right|\leq \frac{d}{2\pi}\left|\oint_{|\alpha-x|=r}\frac{1}{(\alpha-z)^2}d\alpha\right|=0$$ Where in the first equality I use the Cauchy integral theorem. In the inequality I use that $|f(z)|<d$ over the integration curve. And in the last equality I use that $$     \oint_{|\alpha-x|=r}\frac{1}{(\alpha-z)^n}d\alpha=  \begin{cases}     2\pi i,& \text{if } n=-1\\     0,              & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ However this result cannot be correct, because it does not even require $d$ to be small.

31,Is this correct reasoning about Taylor series?,Is this correct reasoning about Taylor series?,,"Is the following correct reasoning about the Taylor series? I'm just trying to build some intuition but just want to make sure it's correct. If a function $f(x)$ has a power series representation it will be of the form: $$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+ \text{ ... } \;\;\;\; \text{(1)}$$ Now we have written the coefficients as $a_k$, but we could also just as well write them as:  $$ a_k=\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} $$ Of course to get this we need to know that $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable. Since we found $a_0$ by letting $x=0$ therefore giving $f(0)=a_0$; similarly for $a_2$, we let $x=0$ for the derivative of $f(x)$, or $f'(x)=a_1$; and so on. Now according to this , if $f(x)$ has a power series representation then it must be of the form (I've just centred it around $0$): $$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n \;\;\;\;\; \text{(2)}$$ Since effectively - assuming the function is infinitely differentiable - we've just re-written the general coefficients $a_k$ into an equally general form, but just in terms of the functions derivative. Thus if a function is infinitely differentiable then (2) is completely equivalent to (1). It's just written in this way so we have a mechanism for finding the coefficients (though it could also be done by setting $x=0$ and considering the various derivatives of $f(x)$ to find the coefficients manually).

And since if there's a power series expansion for $\sin(x)$ it must be of this form; and I would expect there to exist such a power series that could equal the sine function (given enough terms).

I'm just trying to build some intuition but just want to make sure it's correct. If a function $f(x)$ has a power series representation it will be of the form: $$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^n=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+ \text{ ... } \;\;\;\; \text{(1)}$$ Now we have written the coefficients as $a_k$, but we could also just as well write them as:  $$ a_k=\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} $$ Of course to get this we need to know that $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable. Since we found $a_0$ by letting $x=0$ therefore giving $f(0)=a_0$; similarly for $a_2$, we let $x=0$ for the derivative of $f(x)$, or $f'(x)=a_1$; and so on. Now according to this , if $f(x)$ has a power series representation then it must be of the form (I've just centred it around $0$): $$ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n \;\;\;\;\; \text{(2)}$$ Since effectively - assuming the function is infinitely differentiable - we've just re-written the general coefficients $a_k$ into an equally general form, but just in terms of the functions derivative.

Even more importantly, could someone explain what's going on with this example that makes the path integral not be zero. Thanks a lot.",,['complex-analysis']
98,Let $P_N(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^N\frac{z^n}{n!}$. Calculate $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\int_{|z|=2}\frac{1}{P^3(z) - 1}dz$.,Let .

Also, if I could show $P^3(z) - 1$ has only one root once $N$ is so big, then it is easy.  Any suggestions?  Thanks Also, clearly $P_N(z)$ tends toward $e^z$","Let $P_N(z) = \displaystyle\sum_{n = 0}^N\frac{z^n}{n!}$.  Calculate $\displaystyle\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\int_{|z|=2}\frac{1}{P^3(z) - 1}dz$.
