51,Smoothest car trip,Smoothest car trip,,"I was thinking about the trajectory of a car over time from a point $A$ to $B$ and what would be the motion that would feel most smooth for a passenger. If we consider the position as a function of time to be $$\vec{s}(t) = \vec{s_0}+f(t/T) \Delta\vec{s}$$ Where $\vec{s_0}$ is the initial position, $T$ the total travel time and $\Delta\vec{s}$ the difference between the final position and initial position. Then, $f(x)$ will be a function that dictates how ""smooth"" the car trip will be. But to more rigorously define it, its properties should be (in the interval $[0,1]$ ): $f(x)$ is infinitely differentiable $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$ $\frac{d^{n}f}{dx^{n}}=0$ for all $n \geq 1$ at $x=0$ and $x=1$ (The car is absolutely at rest in the beginning and at the end) $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing $f(x+1/2)-1/2$ is an odd function (it is ""symmetric"" with respect to the midpoint of the interval $x=1/2$ ) The maximum value of $|\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}|$ is minimized (minimize the acceleration felt by the passenger) It is ""easy"" to find a function that satisfies the first 5 properties. This video , for example, offers this function: $$f(x) = \frac{e^{-1/x}}{e^{-1/x}+e^{-1/(1-x)}}$$ However, can there be a function with a smaller maximum acceleration/2nd derivative? For this particular function above, the maximum value is quite high, at $9.841$ when $x=0.218$ , and, on a side note, it would provide a very bad car trip! For a 60km trip that takes 60 minutes, it would take more than 6 minutes just to reach 1km/h! Edit: After seeing @Alex K answer, I noticed that the 1st derivative is very similar to a triangle. In fact, it seems to me to be the case that if it is indeed a triangle, the maximum 2nd derivative would be minimized and be equal to 4. So, the 2nd derivative would be 4 from 0 to 1/2 and then -4 from 1/2 to 1.

Either $x=n+1$ so that any $z\in S$ yields $g(z)=f(n+1)=y$ , 2.) or $x<n+1$ and because of $y< n+1$ we know that $x\notin S$ which yields $g(x)=f(x)=y$ .

Also $n+1\neq f(n+1)$ by assumption and $g(x)\neq n+1$ for all $x\in\{1,\dots,n\}$ because $g$ maps to $\{1,\dots,n\}$ . Bearing this in mind we check for injectivity of $f$ .

If $f(x)$ is aperiodic, is the maximum range $[-1, 3]$ and can this be proven? Can the possible range be proven to be more narrow in certain circumstances and how would this be proven?","I'm new to these kinds of functions but I'm interested in mathematical proofs.  Take this function: I assume this can often have no period, so how do you find the maximum and minimum possible values? For example, if , then the range of possible values is , and if , then the range is .  Unless both equal zero, then . So the maximum possible range for is .  But I think with certain values of and that this range can be more narrow, just like with or . If is aperiodic, is the maximum range and can this be proven?

97,$C^{k}_{a}(X) = a \forall X \in \mathbb{N}^{k}$ explanation.,explanation.,C^{k}_{a}(X) = a \forall X \in \mathbb{N}^{k},"I was reading about functions in ""Discrete Mathematics and its Applications"", and in the ""Recursive Functions"" section I came across initial functions. One of which is the idea of a constant function. Now I understand the idea of a constant function. A constant function is a kind of function which no matter the domain, will always give the same output. For example the following is a constant function :- $$f(x) = 9, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$$ But the definition provided in the example in this book, that I could not understand. The definition is as follows :- $$ \text{ For each } k \geq 0 \text{ and each } a \geq 0 \text{ ,the constant function } C^{k}_{a}:\mathbb{N}^{k} \to \mathbb{N} \text{ is defined by the formula } \\ C^{k}_{a}(X) = a \forall X \in \mathbb{N}^{k} $$ Apart from the definition itself, I don't understand the notations $C^{k}_{a}$ and $\mathbb{N}^{k}$ . Any help would be highly appreciated.","I was reading about functions in ""Discrete Mathematics and its Applications"", and in the ""Recursive Functions"" section I came across initial functions.

Thus $f(x)$ is surjective. Suppose $f(a)=f(b)$ for some $a, b$ . Then $P(x, a)$ and $P(x, b)$ give $$f(f(x)+a)=2x+f(f(f(a))-x)=2x+f(f(f(b))-x)=f(f(x)+b)$$ Since $f(x)$ is surjective, $f(x+a)=f(x+b) \, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Now using the above equation and $P(a, y), P(b, y)$ give \begin{align} 2a=f(f(a)+y)-f(f(f(y))-a) & =f(f(a)+y)-f(f(f(y))-(a+b)+b) \\ &=f(f(a)+y)-f(f(f(y))-(a+b)+a) \\ & =f(f(b)+y)-f(f(f(y))-b) \\ & =2b \end{align} Thus $f(x)$ is also injective.
