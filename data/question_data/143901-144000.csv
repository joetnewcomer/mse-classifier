This question is specifically about properly identifying what those theorems are. Firstly, I see that $\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}$ is an upper sum representation of an $n$ -subinterval uniform partition $P_n$ on the closed interval $[0,1]$ . As such, given that $e^x$ is integrable on this interval, the $\inf$ of the set of all $U(e^x,P)$ exists (where this notation refers to the upper sum of $e^x$ on all partitions defined on $[0,1]$ ). Next, I know from previous work ( If $S$ is set of lower sums for partitions having $n$-equal subintervals, does $\sup S$ equal the $\sup$ of the set of lower sums for all partitions. ) that the infimum of the set of all uniform partitions of $[0,1]$ is equal to the infimum of the set of all partitions of $[0,1]$ . It seems to me, then, that all I need to do is show that: $\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}=\inf\{U(e^x,P_n):\text{$U$ is an upper sum of $e^x$ and $P_n$ is a uniform partition of $[0,1]$}\}$ . If I can prove this, then we are good to go because: \begin{align}e-1=\int_0^1 e^x dx &=\inf\{U(e^x,P):\text{$U$ is an upper sum of $e^x$ and $P$ is a partition of $[0,1]$}\}\\ &=\inf\{U(e^x,P_n):\text{$U$ is an upper sum of $e^x$ and $P_n$ is a uniform partition of $[0,1]$}\}\\ &=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}\end{align} So how exactly do I prove that: $$\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}=\inf\{U(e^x,P_n):\text{$U$ is an upper sum of $e^x$ and $P_n$ is a uniform partition of $[0,1]$}\}$$ Through basic partition arguments, I know that: $U(f,P_{a^0}) \geq U(f,P_{a^1}) \geq U(f,P_{a^2}) \geq \cdots\geq U(f, P_{a^m}) \geq\cdots$ for some $a \in \mathbb N$ . but I also know that just because a subsequence is non-increasing does not, in general, mean that the parent sequence is non-increasing. Calculating the upper sums of uniform partitions for the piece-wise function $f=\begin{cases} 0 \quad &\text{ if $x \in [0,1/3]$}\\1 \quad &\text{ if $x \in (1/3,2/3)$}\\0 \quad &\text{ if $x \in [2/3,1]$}\end{cases}$ is a good example of this. So although, for example, the subsequence $U(e^x,P_1),U(e^x,P_2),U(e^x,P_4), \cdots, U(e^x, P_{2^m}), \cdots$ is non-increasing, I am unsure if $U(e^x,P_1),U(e^x,P_2),U(e^x,P_3),U(e^x,P_4),U(e^x,P_5),\cdots,U(e^x,P_m),\cdots$ is non-increasing, as well (if I could confirm this, then we are good to  go). While I could show that: $$\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n} \geq \frac{\sqrt[n+1]{e^1}+\sqrt[n+1]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n+1]{e^{n+1}}}{n+1} $$ I feel like there must be a more general theorem unrelated to the particular choice of $e^x$ as my function...perhaps if $f$ is continuous then we can say something useful? Edit To flesh out some additional details offered by peek-a-boo , Chapter 13's appendix has the following theorem: Suppose that $f$ is Darboux integrable on $[a,b]$ . Then for every $\varepsilon \gt 0$ there is some $\delta \gt 0$ such that, if $P=\{t_0=a,t_1,\cdots,t_{n-1},t_n=b\}$ is any partition of $[a,b]$ with all lengths $t_i-t_{i-1} \lt \delta$ , then: \begin{align} \left| \sum_{i=1}^nf(x_i)(t_i-t_{i-1})-\int_a^b f(x)dx\right| \lt \varepsilon\end{align} As indicated by peak-a-boo (and others), $\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}$ is a Riemann sum of $e^x$ on the closed interval $[0,1]$ where $x_i=\frac{i}{n}$ . By the aforementioned theorem, we know that for an arbitrary $\varepsilon$ : $$\left| \frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots+\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}-\int_0^1 e^xdx\right| \lt \varepsilon$$ where $\frac{1}{n} \lt \delta$ . However, this theorem also tells us that $$\left| \frac{\sqrt[n+j]{e^1}+\sqrt[n+j]{e^2}+\cdots+\sqrt[n+j]{e^{n+j}}}{n+j}-\int_0^1 e^xdx\right| \lt \varepsilon$$ for any $j \in \mathbb N$ because if $1/n \lt \delta$ , then $1/(n+j) \lt \delta$ . As such, for any $\varepsilon$ , we have found an element ( $N=n-1$ ) such that if $m \gt N: \left| \frac{\sqrt[m]{e^1}+\sqrt[m]{e^2}+\cdots+\sqrt[m]{e^{m}}}{m}-\int_0^1 e^xdx\right| \lt \varepsilon$ , meaning that $\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sqrt[n]{e^1}+\sqrt[n]{e^2}+\cdots+\sqrt[n]{e^n}}{n}=\int_0^1 e^xdx$","Problem 9(i) of Spivak's Calculus (Chpt 22) asks for the following limit: The terse solution manual's argument reads as follows: Note: My book has not yet covered infinite series I understand what this argument aims to illustrate, but it seems to me there are several implicit theorems being used here that I do not believe the book has previously addressed (or, at least, not that I am aware of/cannot properly identify).
