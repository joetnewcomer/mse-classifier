1,"Using the complex logarithm as a conformal mapping,","Using the complex logarithm as a conformal mapping,",,"I want to map the upper half plane, y>0, conformally onto the semi-infinite strip u>0, $-\pi < v < \pi$ in the w-plane. I then studied the complex logarithm, and noticed that the principal branch, Log(z), maps every point z in $C - R^- \bigcup {0}$ to w = ln|z| + iArg(z), where Arg(z) ranges from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. So, the images of the whole plane, minus the negative real axis (and 0), have positive real part and imaginary part between $-\pi$ to $\pi$. Is my work done?

3,"Does this product over the primes converge, and if so, to what?","Does this product over the primes converge, and if so, to what?",,"I've been trying to play around with the product: $$\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-(-p)^{-1.5}}$$ Where the product runs over all the prime numbers. The product is similar in appearance to the famous Euler product for the zeta function, evaluated at $1.5$: $$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1.5}}=\zeta(1.5)$$ However, the sign of $p$ is switched, so instead of staying in the reals, as the zeta function does, this new product enters the complex numbers. I have tried approaching it in an interesting way, however my results seem to differ greatly from numerical data, so I would like to know where the issue is and if an answer is known. My work is very largely based off the derivation of Euler's product formula: We begin by defining: $$\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+(-3)^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+\ldots$$ Now, if we multiply by $(-2)^{-s}$, we get: $$ (-2)^{-s}\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+6^{-s}+4^{-s}+2^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+(-4)^{-s}+(-6)^{-s}+\ldots$$ $$=  \ldots+(-6)^{-s}+(-4)^{-s}+(-2)^{-s}+2^{-s}+4^{-s}+6^{-s}+\ldots$$ And by subtracting, we get: $$ \left( 1-(-2)^{-s} \right)\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=\ldots+(-5)^{-s}+(-3)^{-s}+(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}+3^{-s}+5^{-s}+\ldots$$ Similarly, by multiplying by $\left(1-(-p)^{-s} \right)$, we remove all the multiples of $p$, so by multiplying by $\left(1-(-p)^{-s} \right)$ for all prime numbers, we get rid of everything except for $(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}$. Thus we have: $$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left( 1-(-p)^{-s} \right) \cdot \zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)=(-1)^{-s}+1^{-s}=(-1)^{-s}+1$$ Thus, whenever $(-1)^{-s}+1$ is not equal to zero, we can say: $$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-s} }\right)=\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}$$ Now, on the other hand, by definition, we have: $$ \zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-n)^{-s}} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}+(-1)^{-s}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}$$ $$ =\left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{n^{-s}}=\left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\zeta(s)$$ Therefore we have: $$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-s} }\right)=\zeta_{\mathbb{Z}}(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}= \left( 1+(-1)^{-s} \right)\zeta(s)\cdot \frac{1}{(-1)^{-s}+1}=\zeta(s)$$ By plugging in $s=1.5$, we get: $$\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-1.5} }\right)=\zeta(1.5)$$ The reason I don't believe this result is because it is an entirely real number, and also WolframAlpha tells me that the product over the first $50,000$ primes is approximately $0.62+0.68i$. My question also extends to values of $s$ other than $1.5$. When $s$ is an even integer, the product formula is identical to the Euler product formula, so it is clear that the product is equal to the zeta function. When $s$ is an odd integer, my technique of analysis does not apply because $(-1)^{-s}+1$ does equal zero in this case, and in fact the product certainly is not equal to the zeta function. For example (according to WolframAlpha): $$ \prod_{p \text{ prime}}\left(\frac{1}{ 1-(-p)^{-3} }\right) = \frac{\pi^6}{945 \zeta(3)}\neq \zeta(3) $$ My question is, what about all the non-integer values (for example $1.5$)? I cannot find an issue with my work, however much of it is informal and I have never actually taken a course in complex analysis (which I assume would help).

He states the following theorem: Theorem 1 ( Jost Theorem 2.6.2 ) Let $S$ and $\Sigma$ be Riemann Surfaces, assume that $\Sigma$ is hyperbolic and complete with respect to the hyperbolic metric. Then any bounded holomorphic map $f: S\backslash\{p\}\to \Sigma$ extends to a holomorphic map $\overline{f}: S \to \Sigma$. Now, the definition of hyperbolic that Jost is using is not the standard definition, he defines the hyperbolic metric $d_H$ on $\Sigma$ to be $d_H(p,q) := \inf \{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^n d(z_i,w_i): n \in \mathbb{N},\ p_0,\ p_1,\dots,\ p_n \in \Sigma,\ p_0 = p,\ p_n = q,$ $\phantom{spacespacespace} f_i: D \to \Sigma \ \text{holomorphic}, \ f_i(z_i) = p_{i-1},\ f_i(w_i) = p_i   \}$.

Now, if we consider a coordinate chart $\psi_1$ on $S$ in a neighborhood of $\{p\}$, with $\psi_1(p) = 0$, and an atlas $\{(\phi_n,U_n)\}$ on $\Sigma$, we can write $\phi_i \circ f \circ \psi_1^{-1}: D\backslash \{0\} \to D$. On immediately seeing the statement of the theorem, I want to claim that this map is bounded. Is this true? And, if so, can we not simply apply Theorem 2 to obtain Theorem 1? My complex analysis intuition says this should be trivial, but Jost produces a much more complicated proof, which lacks intuition.","Next week I will be giving a lecture, based on Chapter 2.6 from Jost's book Compact Riemann Surfaces . He states the following theorem: Theorem 1 ( Jost Theorem 2.6.2 ) Let $S$ and $\Sigma$ be Riemann Surfaces, assume that $\Sigma$ is hyperbolic and complete with respect to the hyperbolic metric. Then any bounded holomorphic map $f: S\backslash\{p\}\to \Sigma$ extends to a holomorphic map $\overline{f}: S \to \Sigma$. Now, the definition of hyperbolic that Jost is using is not the standard definition, he defines the hyperbolic metric $d_H$ on $\Sigma$ to be $d_H(p,q) := \inf \{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^n d(z_i,w_i): n \in \mathbb{N},\ p_0,\ p_1,\dots,\ p_n \in \Sigma,\ p_0 = p,\ p_n = q,$ $\phantom{spacespacespace} f_i: D \to \Sigma \ \text{holomorphic}, \ f_i(z_i) = p_{i-1},\ f_i(w_i) = p_i   \}$. For reference purposes this is apparently a special case of the ""Kobayashi metric"". Let $D$ be the unit disk in the complex plane. From complex analysis, we have the following theorem (I paraphrase from Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis ): Theorem 2 Suppose $f: D\backslash \{0\} \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic and bounded. Then $f$ has a removable singularity at $0$.

85,Can someone explain the math behind tessellation?,Can someone explain the math behind tessellation?,,"Tessellation is fascinating to me, and I've always been amazed by the drawings of M.C.Escher, particularly interesting to me, is how he would've gone about calculating tessellating shapes. In my spare time, I'm playing a lot with a series of patterns which use a hexagonal grid, and a tessellating design I saw on a chair in my dentist's surgery. Here's some examples of patterns I've worked up... Because I don't really understand the math, I've had to create the basic unit shape by hand, I can see the 60/120 degree angles well enough, but I really want to figure out the proportions of the shape, which appear (from just looking) to be tightly interrelated. A few observations I've made during this process (aside from it being a bit more tricky than I first imagined.) There appears to be a equilateral triangle which contains the key dimensions, and of course the regular hexagon is important, since this essentially forms 2 interwoven hexagonal grids. Beyond this I'm unable to express mathematically what is going on. Key things I'd like to learn are... How to calculate the relative positions of each shape to build the grid programmatically. How to construct the shape unit mathematically. I know that this doesn't help too much in understanding less rigid tessellation designs, such as Escher's reptiles, which I assume MCE made intuitively (I read that he wasn't a mathematician, which I was surprised by.) Anyway, I hope this question isn't too sprawling, and thank you for looking. Additional notes on the origin of this pattern. Previously I'd said, (I believe the pattern is pretty old and of Chinese origin.) . However, this statement was pure speculation based on the appearance of similar patterns in Chinese art, also using the p31m wallpaper tiling method, this one below for example..

I can add controls like sliders and text inputs that affect dimensions. For example, I create a slider t (tolerance) and can then apply t to the radius of my tolerance circles, which I use subsequently to construct the line segments which make up the adjusted shape, these all stay in sync with the slider value.

(These are mostly for my reference, I'm summarising, but please feel free to correct me where I've gone wrong, it would be a big help.) In addition to the p31m symmetry, there's an interesting relationship within the shape dimensions. The struts are of course all of equal width, and obviously all the angles are multiples of $60^\circ$ . I've noted before, that the strut width is one quarter of the construction radius ( $w = \frac{r}{4}$ or as shown below, $2u$ .) To calculate all required measurements we need to use the base unit $u = \frac{r}{8}$ . The distance between the centres of each shape is $9u$ . The length of a edge of the exterior arrow head (and of course it's corresponding interior edge) is $5u$ . The remaining dimensions are the interior  lengths of the arrow head, which are both $2u$ (of course, these interlock with each other.)

I also took a photo of the chair in my dentists surgery, which began this little study of mine.","Tessellation is fascinating to me, and I've always been amazed by the drawings of M.C.Escher, particularly interesting to me, is how he would've gone about calculating tessellating shapes. In my spare time, I'm playing a lot with a series of patterns which use a hexagonal grid, and a tessellating design I saw on a chair in my dentist's surgery. Here's some examples of patterns I've worked up... Because I don't really understand the math, I've had to create the basic unit shape by hand, I can see the 60/120 degree angles well enough, but I really want to figure out the proportions of the shape, which appear (from just looking) to be tightly interrelated. A few observations I've made during this process (aside from it being a bit more tricky than I first imagined.) There appears to be a equilateral triangle which contains the key dimensions, and of course the regular hexagon is important, since this essentially forms 2 interwoven hexagonal grids. Beyond this I'm unable to express mathematically what is going on. Key things I'd like to learn are... How to calculate the relative positions of each shape to build the grid programmatically. How to construct the shape unit mathematically. I know that this doesn't help too much in understanding less rigid tessellation designs, such as Escher's reptiles, which I assume MCE made intuitively (I read that he wasn't a mathematician, which I was surprised by.) Anyway, I hope this question isn't too sprawling, and thank you for looking. Additional notes on the origin of this pattern. Previously I'd said, (I believe the pattern is pretty old and of Chinese origin.) . However, this statement was pure speculation based on the appearance of similar patterns in Chinese art, also using the p31m wallpaper tiling method, this one below for example..

95,Can you make a sphere out of a plane?,Can you make a sphere out of a plane?,,"I had this idea to build a model of Earth in Minecraft. In this game, everything is built on a 2D plane of infinite length and width. But, I wanted to make a world such that someone exploring it could think that they could possibly be walking on a very large sphere. (Stretching or shrinking of different places is OK.) What I first thought about doing was building a finite rectangular model of the world as like a mercator projection, and tessellating this model infinitely throughout the plane. Someone starting in the US could swim eastwards in a straight line across the Atlantic, walk across Africa and Asia, continue through the Pacific and return to the US. This would certainly create a sense of 3D-ness. However, if you travel north from the North Pole, you would wind up immediately at the South Pole. That wouldn't be right. After thinking about it, I hypothesized that an explorer of this model might conclude that they were walking on a donut-shaped world, since that would be the shape of a map where the left was looped around to the right (making a cylinder), and then the top was looped to the bottom. For some reason, by simply tessellating the map, I was creating a hole in the world. Anyway, to solve this issue, I thought about where one ends up after travelling north from various parts of the world. Going north from Canada, and continuing to go in that direction, you end up in Russia and you face south. The opposite is true as well: going north from Russia, you end up in Canada pointing south. Thus, I started to modify the tessellation to properly connect opposing parts of Earth at the poles. When going north of a map of Earth, the next (duplicate) map would have to be rotated 180 degrees to reflect the fact that one facing south after traversing the north pole. This was OK. However, to properly connect everything, the map also had to be flipped about the vertical axis. On a globe, if Alice starts east of Bob and they together walk North and cross the North Pole, Alice still remains east of Bob. So, going north from a map, the next map must be flipped to preserve the east/west directions that would have been otherwise rotated into the wrong direction. Now the situation is hopeless. After an explorer walks across the North Pole in this Minecraft world, he finds himself in a mirrored world. If the world were completely flat, it would feel as if walking North will take you from the outside of a 3D object to its inside. Although I now think that it is impossible to trick an explorer walking on infinite plane into thinking he is on a sphere-like world, a part of me remains unconvinced. Is it really impossible? Also, how come a naive tessellation introduces a hole? And finally, if an explorer were to roam the world where crossing a pole flips everything, what would he conclude the shape of the world to be?","I had this idea to build a model of Earth in Minecraft. In this game, everything is built on a 2D plane of infinite length and width. But, I wanted to make a world such that someone exploring it could think that they could possibly be walking on a very large sphere. (Stretching or shrinking of different places is OK.) What I first thought about doing was building a finite rectangular model of the world as like a mercator projection, and tessellating this model infinitely throughout the plane. Someone starting in the US could swim eastwards in a straight line across the Atlantic, walk across Africa and Asia, continue through the Pacific and return to the US. This would certainly create a sense of 3D-ness. However, if you travel north from the North Pole, you would wind up immediately at the South Pole. That wouldn't be right. After thinking about it, I hypothesized that an explorer of this model might conclude that they were walking on a donut-shaped world, since that would be the shape of a map where the left was looped around to the right (making a cylinder), and then the top was looped to the bottom. For some reason, by simply tessellating the map, I was creating a hole in the world. Anyway, to solve this issue, I thought about where one ends up after travelling north from various parts of the world. Going north from Canada, and continuing to go in that direction, you end up in Russia and you face south. The opposite is true as well: going north from Russia, you end up in Canada pointing south. Thus, I started to modify the tessellation to properly connect opposing parts of Earth at the poles. When going north of a map of Earth, the next (duplicate) map would have to be rotated 180 degrees to reflect the fact that one facing south after traversing the north pole. This was OK. However, to properly connect everything, the map also had to be flipped about the vertical axis. On a globe, if Alice starts east of Bob and they together walk North and cross the North Pole, Alice still remains east of Bob. So, going north from a map, the next map must be flipped to preserve the east/west directions that would have been otherwise rotated into the wrong direction. Now the situation is hopeless. After an explorer walks across the North Pole in this Minecraft world, he finds himself in a mirrored world. If the world were completely flat, it would feel as if walking North will take you from the outside of a 3D object to its inside. Although I now think that it is impossible to trick an explorer walking on infinite plane into thinking he is on a sphere-like world, a part of me remains unconvinced. Is it really impossible? Also, how come a naive tessellation introduces a hole?

96,A goat tied to a corner of a rectangle,A goat tied to a corner of a rectangle,,"A goat is tied to an external corner of a rectangular shed measuring 4 m by 6 m.  If the goat’s rope is 8 m long, what is the total area, in square meters, in which the goat can graze? Well, it seems like the goat can turn a full circle of radius 8 m, and a rectangular shed's diagonal is less than 8m (actually √52), and so shouldn't it be just 6 x 4 = 24 sq metre? The answer says it is 53 pi, and I have no clue why it is so or why my way of solving doesn't work. Updated: Oh, and the only area given is that of the shed's.

97,"Modelling the ""Moving Sofa""","Modelling the ""Moving Sofa""",,"I believe that many of you know about the moving sofa problem; if not you can find the description of the problem here . In this question I am going to rotate the L shaped hall instead of moving a sofa around the corner. By rotating the hall $180^{\circ}$ what remains between the walls will give the shape of the sofa. Like this: The points on the hall have the following properties: \begin{eqnarray} A & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } ,t\sin { \alpha  }  \right)  \\ { A }' & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } +\sqrt { 2 } \cos { \left( \frac { \pi  }{ 4 } +\frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  } ,t\sin { \alpha  } +\sqrt { 2 } \sin { \left( \frac { \pi  }{ 4 } +\frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  }  \right)  \\ { B } & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } -\frac { t\sin { \alpha  }  }{ \tan { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  }  } ,0 \right)  \\ { B }' & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } -\frac { t\sin { \alpha  }  }{ \tan { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  }  } -\frac { 1 }{ \sin { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  }  } ,0 \right)  \\ C & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } +t\sin { \alpha  } \tan { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  } ,0 \right)  \\ { C }' & = & \left( r\cos { \alpha  } +t\sin { \alpha  } \tan { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  } +\frac { 1 }{ \cos { \left( \frac { \alpha  }{ 2 }  \right)  }  } ,0 \right)  \end{eqnarray} Attention: $\alpha$ is not the angle of $AOC$, it is some angle $ADC$ where $D$ changes location on $x$ axis for $r\neq t$. I am saying this because images can create confusion. Anyways I will change them as soon as possible. I could consider $r=f(\alpha)$ and $t=g(\alpha)$ but for this question I am going to take $r$ and $t$ as constants. If they were functions of $\alpha$ there would appear some interesting shapes. I experimented for different functions however the areas are more difficult to calculate, that's why I am not going to share. Maybe in the future. We rotate the hall for $r=t$ in the example above: In this case: point A moves on a semicircle The envelope of lines between A' and C' is a circular arc. One has to prove this but I assume that it is true for $r=t$. If my second assumption is correct the area of sofa is $A= 2r-\frac { \pi r^{ 2 } }{ 2 } +\frac { \pi  }{ 2 } $. The maximum area is reached when $r = 2/\pi$ and it's value is: $$A = 2/\pi+\pi/2 = 2,207416099$$ which matches with Hammersley's sofa. The shape is also similar or same: Now I am going to increase $t$ with respect to $r$. For $r=2/\pi$ and $t=0.77$: Well, this looks like Gerver's sofa . I believe thearea can be maximized by finding the equations of envelopes above and below the sofa. Look at this question where @Aretino has computed the area below $ABC$. I don't know enough to find equations for envelopes. I am afraid that I will make mistakes. I considered to calculate area by counting number of pixels in it, but this is not a good idea because for optimizing the area I have to create many images. I will give a bounty of 200 for whom calculates the maximum area. As I said the most difficult part of the problem is to find equations of envelopes. @Aretino did it. PLUS: Could following be the longest sofa where $(r,t)=((\sqrt 5+1)/2,1)$ ? If you want to investigate further or use animation for educational purposes here is the Geogebra file: http://ggbm.at/vemEtGyj Ok, I had some free time and I count number of pixels in the sofa and I am sure that I have something bigger than Hammersley's constant. First, I made a simulation for Hammersley's sofa where $r=t=2/\pi$ and exported the image to png in 300 dpi (6484x3342 pixels) and using Gimp counted number of pixels which have exactly same value. For Hammersley I got $3039086$ pixels. For the second case $r=0.59$ and $t=0.66$ and I got $3052780$ pixels. To calculate area for this case: $$\frac{3052780}{3039086}(2/\pi + \pi/2)=2.217362628$$ which is slightly less than Gerver's constant which is $2.2195$.
