Hence the slope of line passing through points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ will be positive. From observation $(ii)$ , which says that if $(x,y)\in X$ , then $a_1\leq x\leq a_2$ and $b_1\leq y\leq b_2$ , it can be inferred that the subset $S$ denotes a rectangle in $R^2$ with vertices $(a_i,b_i),\space i,j=1$ or $2$ . (suppose this) From observation $(iii)$ , the point can be written as $(\lambda(x_1-x_2)+x_2,\space \lambda(y_1-y_2)+y_2)$ . It can be observed that this point satisfies the equation $y-y_2=\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}(x-x_2)$ . Thus any such point will lie on the line joining $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ .

Thus this point will always lie on line segment joining the points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ . Using these observations, we can say that $(\lambda(a_1-a_2)+a_2,\lambda(b_1-b_2)+b_2)$ or $(λa_1+(1−λ)a_2,λb_1+(1−λ)b_2)$ will lie on line segment joining $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_2,b_2)$ .

Let $A$ be a finite set. Then any function $f: A \to A$ that is injective is also surjective. Proof. Let $f: A \to A$ be injective, where $A$ is a finite set. Define $C = \text{Im}(f)$ , where by definition $C \subset A$ . It suffices to show that $C = A$ . For every $c \in C$ , define $$g_c = f^{-1} (\{c\}),$$ the inverse image of the element $c$ under the map $f$ . Clearly, there exists a bijection $\alpha: \{g_c\} \to C$ given by $g_c \mapsto c$ . Furthermore, since $f$ is injective, for any $c$ , $|f^{-1} (\{c\})| = 1$ . Since $f$ is a total function on $A$ , for every $a \in A$ , there exists a unique $c \in C$ such that $f(a) = c$ . Hence, the preimage of every $c \in C$ must exhaust the domain of $A$ , so $$\bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) = A.$$ Set equality implies equality in cardinality, so $$\left \lvert \bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) \right \rvert = |A|.$$ As each of these sets $f^{-1} (\{c\})$ are disjoint (by injectivity of $f$ ), we can invoke finite additivity to write $$\left \lvert \bigcup\limits_{c \in C} f^{-1} (\{c\}) \right \rvert = \sum\limits_{c \in C} |f^{-1} (\{c\})| = |A|.$$ Since we deduced earlier that the set $\{g_c\}$ are in bijective correspondence with $|C|$ , we have $$\sum\limits_{c \in C} |f^{-1} (\{c\})| = \sum\limits_{c \in C} 1 = |C| \cdot 1 = |C|.$$ Hence, $$|C| = |A|.$$ Since $A$ and $C$ are finite sets, this implies that $C = A$ .

Now, we have to prove that: $(U-B) \subset (U-A) \implies (A \subset B)$ Let $x$ be an object such that $x \in A$ . Then, $x \in U$ , since $A \subset U$ . Hence, $\lnot{(x \in U-A)}$ is true. This implies that $\lnot{(x \in U-B)}$ is true as well as this is just the contrapositive of the hypothesis. This just means that $x \in U-B$ must be false. Since we know that $x \in U$ is true, it follows that $\lnot{(x \in B)}$ must be false and, hence, $x \in B$ must be true. This proves that $A \subset B$ .

I was wondering if it was a correct proof because I really like it and want to know if it has any logical pitfalls. Let us consider the expansion of $$(1+x)^n= \binom{n}{0} x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1}x^{1} + \binom{n}{n}x^0$$ Clearly, this contains every power of $x$ from $0$ to $n$ .  Now this can be seen as the set containing $n$ elements being partitioned into subsets if all sizes from size $0$ to $n$ . For the purposes of this paper we are not concerned with the elements in the subsets only the size. The coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ in the expansion of $(1+x)^n$ are the number of subsets with $k$ elements if we group them only by size.  Now, the rest of the proof follows simply, we know that, $$(x+1)^n= \binom{n}{0} x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1}x^{1} + \binom{n}{n}x^0$$ Putting, $x=1$ in this equation, we get, $$(2)^n= \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ Or, $$2^n = \sum^{i=n} _{i=0} \binom{n}{i}$$ Also, putting $x=-1$ we get, $$0= \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \ldots - \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ Or, $$0= \sum^{i=n} _{i=0} (-1)^i\binom{n}{i}$$ Now adding the two equations, we get, $$2^n = 2\cdot \sum^{i=n} _{i=0,i\neq 2k+1 \forall k =(0,1\ldots \lfloor {\frac{n-1}{2}}\rfloor)} \binom{n}{i}$$ That is the sum of the even coefficients is $2^{n-1}$ which is the same as saying that the sum of all the subsets having an even number of elements (total number of subsets having an even number of elements) is $2^{n-1}$ and now putting this back into the first equation, $$0= \binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \ldots - \binom{n}{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}$$ We get, the sum of the odd coefficients, or total number of subsets with odd number of elements is also $2^{n-1}$","So for this, I wrote a different proof than the one given in the textbook I'm studying discrete math from.

This property can be reformulated in terms of limit points. A point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is said to be a limit point of the set $\Omega$ if there exists a sequence of points $z_n \in \Omega$ such that $z_n \not= z$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z$ . The reader can now check that a set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points. I want to prove the following: A set is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points. Proof 1: I begin by assuming that the set $\Omega$ contains all of its limit points. $$\therefore \Omega = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : (z_n \not = z) \cap (\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z) \},$$ where $z_n \in \Omega$ is a sequence of points. And so we have that $$\begin{align} \Omega^c &= \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : (z_n = z) \cup (\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n \not= z) \} \\ &= \{ z \in \mathbb{C} \} - \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : (z_n \not= z) \cap (\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = z) \} \\ &= \mathbb{C} - \Omega \end{align}$$ Proof 2: Assume that the set $\Omega$ is closed. Therefore, $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is open, since a set is closed if its complement $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega$ is open. A set is open if every point in that set is an interior point. Therefore, every point $z \in \Omega^c$ is an interior point. Therefore, every point in the set $(\Omega^c)^c = \Omega$ is not an interior point. This is where I'm unsure of how to proceed.

Finally, a set $\Omega$ is open if every point in that set is an interior point of $\Omega$ .

The textbook later gives an equivalent theorem in terms of limit points, and I will attempt to prove this one later. My proof proceeds as follows: We begin by assuming that $\Omega^c = \mathbb{C} - \Omega = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : z \not\in \Omega \}$ is an open set. A set is open if every point in that set is an interior point. Therefore, if $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ , there exists $r > 0$ such that $$D_r (z_0) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| < r \} = \Omega^c$$ This is the open set. Now here's where I get confused. Next, I take the complement of the set $\Omega^c$ . As I understand it, the complement is the negation, and so when we take the complement of a set, we take the negation of the set condition: $$(\Omega^c)^c = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| \ge r \} = \Omega$$ This should be a closed set, but it isn't. A closed set is defined as $$\bar{D}_r (z_0) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| \le 0 \}$$ But the negation of $<$ is $\ge$ , which is why I have $\Omega = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| \ge r \}$ I would greatly appreciate it if people could please tell me what I'm misunderstanding and how this should be done. EDIT: The closed disc $\bar{D}_r(z_0)$ of radius $r$ centred at $z_0$ is defined by $$\bar{D}_r(z_0) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| \le r \}$$ and the boundary of either the open or closed disc is the circle $$C_r(z_0) = \{ z \in \mathbb{C} : |z - z_0| = r \}$$ Given a set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}$ , a point $z_0$ is an interior point of $\Omega$ if there exists $r > 0$ such that $$D_r(z_0) \subset \Omega$$ Finally, a set $\Omega$ is open if every point in that set is an interior point of $\Omega$ .","I am trying to prove the following theorem in the context of complex analysis: A set is closed if its complement is open. Preceding this theorem, the textbook does define open/closed sets and interior points, but it is only after this theorem that the textbook defines limit points . Therefore, I'm guessing that this should be provable without limit points (using the information conveyed up till this point in the textbook). The textbook later gives an equivalent theorem in terms of limit points, and I will attempt to prove this one later. My proof proceeds as follows: We begin by assuming that is an open set. A set is open if every point in that set is an interior point. Therefore, if , there exists such that This is the open set. Now here's where I get confused. Next, I take the complement of the set . As I understand it, the complement is the negation, and so when we take the complement of a set, we take the negation of the set condition: This should be a closed set, but it isn't. A closed set is defined as But the negation of is , which is why I have I would greatly appreciate it if people could please tell me what I'm misunderstanding and how this should be done.
