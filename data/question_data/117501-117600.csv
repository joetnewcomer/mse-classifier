2,Stefan-Boltzmann Constant and Stefan's Law,Stefan-Boltzmann Constant and Stefan's Law,,"The following argument is from my textbook, An Introduction to Thermal Physics by Daniel Schroeder. If you are familiar with the derivation of Stefan's Law from the energy density of a photon gas, you can scroll down to the bottom where I state my question. I am looking for a more simple explanation for the result of the following derivation. Using Bose-Einstein statistics, we have derived that the energy density of a photon gas is  $$\frac{U}{V} = \frac{8\pi^5}{15} \frac{(kT)^4}{(hc)^3}$$ We would like to now understand how photons are emitted from an idealized black body. Consider a box filled with a photon gas with a hole of area $A$ on one side. We are concerned with computing the amount of energy that escapes per unit time. The photons that escape the hole during a time interval $dt$ were once pointed at the hole from somewhere within a hemispherical shell centered at the hole. Say the shell has radius $R$. The thickness of the shell is $c$ $dt$. Below is a diagram of a cross-section of the described situation. The shaded chunk of the shell has volume $$\text{volume of chunk} = R \, d\theta \times r \sin \theta \, d\phi \times c \, dt$$ where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle not shown (it ranges from $0$ to $2 \pi$, and can be thought of revolving the semi-circle around its central axis). Assuming a uniform density of photons in the box, the energy in the chunk is just the energy density above times the volume of this chunk: $$\text{energy in chunk} = \frac{U}{V} c dt R^2 \sin \theta d\theta d\phi$$ However, not all of the energy in this chunk will escape through the hole. Assume the photons in the chunk are have random directions. The probability of any single photon escaping through the hole is equal to the apparent area of the hole (as viewed from the chunk's location) divided by the total area of a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the chunk (i.e. the total area of the places the photon could end up). $$\text{probability of escape} = \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi R^2}$$ Therefore, the energy that escapes from this chunk is $$\text{energy escaping from chunk} = \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi} \frac{U}{V} c dt \sin \theta d\theta d\phi$$ We can find the total energy escaping by integrating over all hemispherical angles $$\text{total energy escaping} = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{A \cos \theta}{4 \pi} \frac{U}{V} c \sin \theta d\theta = \frac{A}{4} \frac{U}{V} c dt$$ This final result gives us Stefan's law: $$\text{power per unit area} = \frac{c}{4} \frac{U}{V} = \frac{2 \pi^5}{15} \frac{(kT)^4}{h^3 c^2} = \sigma T^4$$ We went through all of this trouble just to find that the power emitted per unit area is equal to the energy density times the speed of light, divided by four. The factor $c$ makes sense: the photons (which are carrying the energy) are traveling at that speed, so the rate of energy emission should be proportional to $c$ times the energy density. So, the only non-obvious thing the geometric derivation provided is the factor $\frac{1}{4}$. My question is... ..is there a simpler explanation for this factor of $\frac{1}{4}$? Is there some sort of symmetry argument? Or do you have to deal with integrating over all these angles?","The following argument is from my textbook, An Introduction to Thermal Physics by Daniel Schroeder.

Therefore the time to the center is the same as the time it takes one turtle to walk across a side of the square.

18,How to count polyhedral rotations?,How to count polyhedral rotations?,,"Suppose I have a regular polytope $P$ which I'm representing as a graph $G_P$ with vertices and edges.  I can already put this data into a computer program to find a list of symmetries of $P$ ---they're just the graph isomorphisms from $G_P$ to itself. But as I understand it, half(?) of these isomorphisms will be orientation-preserving and the other half will be orientation-flipping. How can I make a list of the graph isomorphisms that are orientation-preserving?  Does the adjacency data from the graph (which is abstract and not embedded in any geometric space) already determine which isomorphisms preserve/flip orientation, or is it necessary to supply some additional structure such as an embedding of the graph, a directed traversal of the edges, or a list of the vertices of a face in clockwise order?  Given whatever additional data, what should the algorithm be? Edit: I'm wondering if I can find the orientation-preserving symmetries using algebra: I believe the square of any symmetry is a rotation. So there's a subgroup generated by the squares, and they're all rotations. Is this all the rotations (I'd generally doubt it), or how might we get the rest? Maybe there's only a few groups that satisfy the properties that (1) they contain exactly half the members of the symmetry group (2) they contain all the perfect squares.  In that case, it might be that any one of those groups could be the rotation group given an appropriate embedding --- i.e. each one is isomorphic to the rotation group. In that case I'd wonder if we need any additional constraints to guarantee that all the subgroups that satisfy these constraints are (isomorphic to) the group of rotations. Edit #2: I can prove that the sign of a group automorphism is independent of choice of embedding, but I am still searching for a constructive method to compute it from the graph without using coordinates as an intermediate. The proof that the sign is independent of the choice of embedding is as follows: Let $P$ be a regular polytope, fix $S\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ as points for $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , let $G$ be the abstract graph of $P$ and let $V$ be its vertices. A graph automorphism is any bijection $\rho:V\rightarrow V$ that preserves and reflects the adjacency relationships of the graph $G$ . A choice of coordinates for $G$ is a map $\chi: V\cong S\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ .  Let's fix one such coordinate choice as our canonical coordinates: $\chi :V\cong S$ . Every other choice of coordinates factors uniquely through $\chi$ : if $\chi^\prime$ is any other choice of coordinates, then $\chi^\prime = \sigma\circ \chi$ for some unique isometry $\sigma:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ . Given a choice of coordinates $\chi$ , every graph automorphism $\rho:V\rightarrow V$ corresponds to a unique isometry of Euclidean space $\sigma_\rho :\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , such that $\sigma_\rho \circ \chi = \chi \circ \rho$ (""the isometry after embedding is equivalent to the automorphism before embedding"") Let $\rho:V\rightarrow V$ be any graph automorphism, and let $\chi, \chi^\prime : V\cong S \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be two embeddings of the graph. We'll show that, under the two embeddings $\chi,\chi^\prime$ , the automorphism $\rho$ induces two isometries $\sigma,\sigma^\prime$ with the same sign. This shows that the isometry induced by $\rho$ has the same sign under any choice of coordinates, which means that $\rho$ 's sign is determined independent of any embedding. By (5), we can find the unique isometries $\sigma$ and $\sigma^\prime$ such that $$\sigma\circ \chi = \chi \circ \rho$$ and $$\sigma^\prime \circ \chi^\prime = \chi^\prime \circ \rho.$$ By (4), we can factor $\chi^\prime = \tau\circ \chi$ for some unique isometry $\tau$ . Factoring $\tau$ out of the second equation above gives: $$\sigma^\prime \circ \tau \circ \chi = \tau \circ \chi \circ \rho$$ Composing $\tau$ on the left of the first equation gives: $$\tau \circ \sigma \circ \chi = \tau \circ \chi \circ \rho $$ The right hand sides of these two equations are equal; hence their left hand sides must be equal as well: $$\sigma^\prime \circ \tau \circ \chi = \tau \circ \sigma \circ \chi$$ The choice of coordinates is injective, so we can drop it, leaving just a commutative square: $\sigma^\prime \circ \tau = \tau \circ \sigma$ . Now every term in this equation is an isometry $\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ , meaning it has a determinant whose value is $\pm 1$ . $$\det(\sigma^\prime \circ \tau) = \det(\tau \circ \sigma)$$ $$\det(\sigma^\prime)\cdot \det(\tau) = \det(\tau) \cdot \det(\sigma)$$ $$\det(\sigma^\prime) = \det(\sigma)$$ Hence the two isometries induced by the two choices of coordinates for the graph automorphism $\rho$ have the same sign, QED.","Suppose I have a regular polytope which I'm representing as a graph with vertices and edges.

The main focus of this question is to obtain this locus. So far I know the following: Suppose you start from the surface of the Earth of radius $R$ at latitude/longitude $(\varphi_1,\lambda_1)$ and walk a ( rhumb line , not geodesic) distance $d$ at a constant bearing $\theta$ . Then it can be shown that the latitude $\varphi_2$ and longitude $\lambda_2$ after walking this distance is (normalize to $\varphi_{1,2}\in [-\pi/2,\pi/2]$ and $\lambda_{1,2}\in [-\pi,\pi)$ if necessary) $$\varphi_2=\varphi_1+\frac{d}{R}\cos(\theta),$$ $$\lambda_2=\lambda_1+\frac{d}{R}\cdot \frac{\sin(\theta)}{q},$$ where $$q:=\begin{cases} \frac{\varphi_2-\varphi_1}{\ln(\tan(\varphi_2/2+\pi/4)/\tan(\varphi_1/2+\pi/4))},&\mathrm{if}~\theta\not\in \{\pi/2,3\pi/2\}, \\ \cos(\varphi_1),&\mathrm{otherwise}. \end{cases}$$ Hence, we are asking for fixed points of the function $f_{z,\gamma}\circ f_{y,\beta}\circ f_{x,\alpha}$ where $f_{d,\theta}$ is defined as $$f_{d,\theta}(\varphi_1,\lambda_1)=(\varphi_2,\lambda_2)$$ where $\varphi_2$ and $\lambda_2$ are as above. The problem is that I do not think it is easy to solve for the fixed points. I also thought about solving such an equation numerically.

As far as I know, this is still open even in the case of polyominoes: we do not know if there is a single polyomino that forces an aperiodic tiling of the plane. I am curious about the case where we treat the polyominoes as fixed , i.e., when we consider rotated/reflected copies of a tile as distinct, and only permit translations. In this situation, we do know that more than one tile is needed; as shown in this paper , a single fixed polyomino tiles the plane periodically if it forms any tessellation at all. (In fact, we can ensure the tiling is isohedral!) Conversely, there exist finite sets of fixed polyominoes which tile the plane, but not in a periodic manner. If we use Wang tiles to generate polyominoes, we can obtain a solution with $11$ tiles (which is minimal), but there are smaller solutions. For instance, consider Matthew Cook's set of three polyominoes which force an aperiodic tiling (with rotations and reflections allowed): We observe that the tiling only makes use of $4$ orientations each of two of the tiles, and a single orientation of the third tile, so only $9$ fixed polyominoes are needed in total. The answer is therefore somewhere between $2$ and $9$ inclusive; I am interested in learning of any improvements to either the upper or lower bounds, or pointers to discussion of this problem in the literature. One potential avenue for a smaller upper bound is the aperiodic set of polyominoes described at this Wolfram MathWorld page as being announced by Roger Penrose in 1994, but it gives no further details, and I have been unable to track down a reference.","A longstanding open problem asks whether there is a single connected tile that only tiles the plane aperiodically.

25,Why are there exactly eight convex polygons that can appear in a Penrose tiling?,Why are there exactly eight convex polygons that can appear in a Penrose tiling?,,"Problem Suppose that we have a P $3$ Penrose tiling , using rhombi of smallest angles $36^\circ$ and $72^\circ$ : Which convex shapes can be found as a union of rhombi in this tiling? The answer appears to be $8$ , as shown below: The regular decagon here can be formed in another way, but both have the same union so I am counting them once. (As a remark, these eight convex polygons must show up in any Penrose tiling, because all Penrose tilings contain every legal finite patch infinitely often within them.) Note that there are many convex polygons that could be formed from the Penrose rhombs, but it seems that only those pictured above can be extended to a tiling that respects the matching rules. Classification We can represent any convex polygon formed from Penrose rhombs by describing its side lengths along each of ten possible directions ( $0^\circ, 36^\circ, \ldots, 324^\circ$ ), since there are only $5$ orientations of undirected edges in a Penrose tiling. It is also easy to see (by considering what happens when we repeatedly cross from one edge of a rhombus to the opposite parallel edge) that opposite edges in such a polygon must be of the same length. Subject to these restrictions, it appears that the permissible cyclic orders of sides in such a polygon fall into one of two classes, if we normalize the rhombs to have unit edge length: All side lengths are either $0$ or $1$ (i.e. we have some kind of unit equilateral quadrilateral, hexagon, octagon, or decagon). All side lengths are either $1$ or $2$ , and no two sides of length $2$ touch. The above two categories exactly describe the eight convex polygons I have found. However, it is not apparent to me why this should be the case; why can't we have a polygon with sides in cyclic order $(2,1,2,0,0,2,1,2,0,0)$ , for instance? Many such polygons can be tiled with the rhombi, just in ways that turn out to be incompatible with the Penrose matching rules. Proof strategies It seems straightforward, if tedious, to classify all possible ways that one can legally arrange tiles along the border of a convex curve and discard those which prove incompatible with the P $3$ matching rules until all cases have been exhausted. However, I am hopeful that a more enlightening proof exists, given all the nice properties that Penrose tilings are known to have and the apparent simplicity of the resulting classification. One avenue of attack might be to show several local rules about Penrose tiles that together imply this classification. For instance (I believe both of these are in fact true): Three parallel edges cannot meet end-to-end (so a polygon cannot have edges of length $\ge3$ ). No vertex in the tiling is the endpoint of two different ""spokes"" of two end-to-end parallel edges (so edges of length $2$ cannot be adjacent). Some other properties? Put together, these might be able to show that no polygons other than the ones pictured are possible, but this sort of approach alone would not show existence for the cases that are possible; given that these configurations are inevitable in any tiling, it would be nice to see a natural proof that they must appear which does not manually construct each one and show that it fits into a valid Penrose tiling.","Problem Suppose that we have a P Penrose tiling , using rhombi of smallest angles and : Which convex shapes can be found as a union of rhombi in this tiling?

We then add (integrate) all errors of all the small volumes of all the pieces that we generated. This result is the value that we want to minimize. The question is, what’s the best approach to cut the sphere (apple) in order to minimize the error function (in order to be more palatable)?",,"['geometry', 'algorithms', 'numerical-methods']"

54,Proof Strategy for a Dynamical System of Points on the Plane,Proof Strategy for a Dynamical System of Points on the Plane,,"I have a rather simple-looking system which exhibits a particular behaviour in simulation, and I would now like to attempt to prove this formally. The problem is, I don't really know where to start, and would very much appreciate some suggestions on different ways that I could try out. System Description I will try to describe the system as concisely as I can (but I'm happy to add details as comments on request). There are $n$ points on a plane, which are initially randomly distributed. Each point has a position, $(x,y)$, and an orientation, $\theta$, and projects a line of sight (LOS) along this orientation. Every point moves in one of two ways, depending on whether its LOS intersects at least one circle of radius $r$ centered around another point ($r$ being a fixed parameter). If there is an intersection, the point turns clockwise on the spot (i.e. $\dot{\theta}=\omega$, $\omega$ being a fixed parameter). Otherwise, it moves backwards (i.e. with the LOS pointing opposite the direction of motion) along a circular trajectory of radius $R$ ($R$ being a fixed parameter). Emergent Behaviour For the right values of $R$ and $\omega$ (which I have found through simulation), the points will aggregate into one 'cluster' (one can define a metric, e.g., by saying that every point is at a distance of at most $d$ from at least one other point). I want to prove that this aggregation happens from any given set of initial positions and orientations. What I Have Tried So Far Two approaches come to my mind. One can either attack the problem using geometry, or represent it in state space and try to analyse the resultant system of ODEs. Using geometry, I have made the assumption that only one point moves at a time (this would not be a complete proof, but is acceptable for me). I have rather easily proven that one moving point will approach one static point, but I have no idea how to generalize this.

It says, roughly, that the if you intersect lines $ax + by + c$ with a smooth, closed, convex curve, then the area of the curve that the line cuts off cannot be expressed as an algebraic function of $a, b$ and $c$. My question is regarding Newton's proof. There are a couple versions out there, but I'll summarize the one on Wikipedia. Fix a point $P$ inside the curve, and fix a line $L$ through $P$. Construct a spiral, $f$ as follows: draw another line $M$ through $P$, and let $\theta$ be the angle this makes with $L$. Thus $L$ and $M$ close off a sector of the curve, with some area $A(\theta)$.

Thus the spiral cannot be algebraic, for if it were then there would be infinitely many solutions to a polynomial. Fine.

I am self-studying the wonderful book, Elementary Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint . In chapter 1, problem 18 it says: Postulate M-6 (which says 1 not equal to 0 ) may seem superfluous. Is it? Can it be proved, on the basis of the other postulates, that there is any number at all other than 0? The ""other postulates"" include the commutativity, associativity, identity, and distributive laws for addition and multiplication. I don't see how to show that without the postulate 1 not equal to 0 it cannot be shown that there is any number other than 0. Would you help please?",,"['geometry', 'axioms']"

72,Maximum number of circles tangent to two concentric circles,Maximum number of circles tangent to two concentric circles,,"In a recent math contest, the following question arose: Two concentric circles of radii 1 and 9 make a ring. In the interior of this ring $n$ circles are drawn without overlapping, each being tangent to both of the circles of the ring. What is the largest possible value for $n$? I solved it like this: The radius of each of the small circles must be $(9-1)/2=4$. I connected the centres of two of the small circles together, and also to the centre of the large circle. Let the central angle be $\theta$. The triangle formed has side lengths $4+1=5$, $4+1=5$, and $4+4=8$. This can be split in two to get two 3-4-5 triangles. Since these triangles are right, we can solve for $\theta$: $$ \begin{align} \sin\frac{\theta}{2}&=\frac{4}{5}\\ \frac{\theta}{2}&=\arcsin{\frac{4}{5}}\\ \theta&=2\arcsin\frac{4}{5}. \end{align} $$ Now the answer to the question is simply $\left\lfloor\frac{2\pi}{\theta}\right\rfloor=3$.

I don't even know how to try to solve it. It goes like this: 6 points are given in a room. These points are pairwise differently distant from each over. However no 3 points may lie on a straight line. Observe all triangles whose corners are the aforementioned points. Now prove that there is always one triangle whose shortest side is the longest side of another triangle.,I have received this question and am having great difficulties.

The teacher says that the volume of a cube is the greatest among rectangular-faced shapes of the same perimeter and asks his students to prove this proposition. I considered the relationship between the length of the sides of a cube and the lengths of the sides of rectangular-faced shapes in different situation. But when the calculations came down to polynomials, I couldn't proceed due to the uncertainty of the variables in the polynomials. Can anyone please find a good way to prove the above proposition?
