E.g. $$ \forall a \forall b[\forall x(x\in a\wedge x\in b)\rightarrow a=b] $$ I am aware that conjunction and the biconditional are not logically equivalent since their truth tables differ in the case where both argument propositions are false. So it seems that these two forms should differ in the case where an element of the domain is neither in a nor b. Using the conjunction form, this case makes the main conditional of the axiom  vacuously true ($False\rightarrow True$). Using the biconditional form, this case makes the main conditional of the form $True\rightarrow True$. Either way, the main conditional is true.

If all sets could be described as elements that satisfy some condition (or open sentence) wouldn't that mean sets are the solution sets of open sentences?

For example, one can take the sequence of finite initial segments of the decimal expansion of $a$ , being careful when $a$ is a base-10 rational to pick one of the two decimal expansions explicitly. But what if we are given a set of Cauchy sequences of rationals, all converging to the same real. The set might not contain all the Cauchy sequences for that real. How hard is it to pick a ""canonical"" representative from the sequences that are in the set? To make this question precise: consider a family of sets $C$ so that each $X \in C$ is a set of Cauchy sequences of rationals that all converge to the same real $a(X)$ . Note that $X$ is not required to have the entire set of Cauchy sequences for $a(X)$ . Does ZF prove the existence of a choice function for each family $C$ of this kind? There are two aspects of Cauchy sequences that make this problem interesting. First, every infinite subsequence of a Cauchy sequence is again a Cauchy sequence converging to the same real. So we cannot hope for a ""minimal"" sequence. Also, we may prepend any finite sequence to a Cauchy sequence to yield a new Cauchy sequence converging to the same real. So we cannot hope for a ""maximal"" sequence. Cauchy sequences are very slippery in this way.
