1,Furstenberg's topological proof of infinitude of primes,Furstenberg's topological proof of infinitude of primes,,"There's fairly well-known proof of infinitude of prime numbers by using topology by Furstenberg. ( Here is K.Conrad's note about the proof). As we can see in the last section, Furstenberg's topological proof is actually not topological, but only uses the terminology. In fact, it is almost same as Euclid's famous argument. So I have some questions about this proof, especially some possible generalizations. 1) How far can we generalize this to an arbitrary (infinite) ring? I think we can prove that there are infinitely many irreducible elements in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ , a ring of integer of some number field $K$ , by using the same argument with suitable modification. Also, it seems possible to prove that any $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ has infinitely many prime ideals, at least if it has finitely many units (like totally imaginary fields). 2) Can we really prove something related to topology by using a similar argument? For example, by defining a suitable topology on some set $X$ , can we prove that there are infinitely many irreducible subsets, or elements in $X$ , where irreducible may depend on context? For example, can we prove that there are infinitely many prime geodesics on a hyperbolic surface by defining some suitable topology on it?

8,"Must a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ intersect the curves $\eta + \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n}$ ($n \geqslant 1$)?",Must a curve  intersect the curves  ()?,"\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2 \eta + \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n} n \geqslant 1","Must a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ intersect   the curves $\eta + \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n}$ ( $n \geqslant 1$ )? This is the fourth - and with any luck, the last! - in a series of distinct but related questions.  I believe that the three previous questions have all been answered satisfactorily.  At any rate, this is indisputably true of the most recent one (which was also asked by me). It summarises the history of the problem so far, and it makes a general conjecture, which was found to be too general: If $\gamma\colon[a,b]\to\mathbb{C}$ is continuous and $\gamma(b)=-\gamma(a)$ , must the curves $\gamma$ and $e^{ic}\gamma$ intersect for all real $c$ ? . The present question is trivial for $n = 1$ .  That its answer is positive for $n = 2$ is almost a consequence of the two detailed answers [also, for all I know, of the third, less detailed answer] to the second question in the series: A continuous curve intersects its 90 degrees rotated copy? . The similar proposition for $\mathbb{R}^k$ ( $k \ne 2$ ) is trivially true if $k = 1$ , and (almost as trivially) false if $k > 2$ and $n > 1$ . For example, if $k = 3$ , any polygonal path whose vertices are $(0, 0, 0)$ , $(1, 0, 0)$ , $(1, 1, 0)$ and $(1, 1, 1)$ , in that order, does not intersect its image under translation via the vector $\left(\frac1n, \frac1n, \frac1n\right)$ . For $\mathbb{R}^2$ , if there is any counterexample [it seems entirely possible to me that there is one - but my judgement has been almost infallibly wrong, so far!], then there exists a counterexample that is piecewise linear, i.e. a polygonal path. Proof For all $z \in \mathbb{R}^2$ [I'll use $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}$ almost interchangeably, whenever the use of the complex number system seems advantageous, but no serious complex analysis is ever involved - only the basic properties of the complex exponential function], and $\delta > 0$ , let $N(z, \delta)$ denote the open disc with centre $z$ and radius $\delta$ . For all $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ , write $N(S, \delta) = \bigcup_{z \in S} N(z, \delta)$ . $N(S, \delta)$ is open, for all $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ . If $S$ is connected, then so is $N(S, \delta)$ . A connected, open subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is path-connected.  Indeed (as is well-known, easily proved, and important for the argument here), any two of its points can be joined by a polygonal path. (The edges of this path can even be chosen to be all parallel to one or other of the axes, but we'll not need this result.) For any curve [by which term of course I mean a continuous function] $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ , denote its image $\eta([a, b])$ by $[\eta]$ : this is a connected, compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . For $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ , define the curve $\eta + v \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ by $(\eta + v)(t) = \eta(t) + v$ ( $a \leqslant t \leqslant b$ ). Clearly $[\eta + v] = [\eta] + v$ , where $S + v = \{z + v : z \in S\}$ ( $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ ). If $[\eta] \cap [\eta + v] = \emptyset$ , then, by compactness, there exist $z^* \in [\eta]$ , $w^* \in [\eta + v]$ such that $|z - w| \geqslant |z^* - w^*|$ for all $z \in [\eta]$ , $w \in [\eta + v]$ . Let $|z^* - w^*| = 2\delta$ . Then $\delta > 0$ , and $N([\eta], \delta) \cap N([\eta + v], \delta) = \emptyset$ . Let $\eta^*$ be a polygonal path joining $\eta(a)$ to $\eta(b)$ in $N([\eta], \delta)$ . Then $\eta^* + v$ is a polygonal path joining $\eta(a) + v$ to $\eta(b) + v$ in $N([\eta + v], \delta)$ , whence $[\eta^*] \cap [\eta^* + v] = \emptyset$ . If $\eta$ is a counterexample to the conjecture, then $[\eta] \cap [\eta + v] = \emptyset$ , where $$ v = \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{n} = \frac{\eta^*(b) - \eta^*(a)}{n}, $$ for any polygonal path $\eta^*$ joining $\eta(a)$ to $\eta(b)$ . It has just been shown that there exists such an $\eta^*$ satisfying $[\eta^*] \cap [\eta^* + v] = \emptyset$ , i.e. $\eta^*$ is also a counterexample. $\square$ A conjecture only slightly weaker than the present one is: If $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ is continuous and $\gamma(b) = -\gamma(a)$ , then the curves $\gamma$ and $e^{i\pi/n}\gamma$ intersect for every positive integer $n$ . Proof The proposition concerning $\gamma$ is trivial if $0 \in [\gamma]$ , so we assume $0 \notin [\gamma]$ . In that case, there exists a branch $\eta$ of $\operatorname{Log}\gamma$ on $[a, b]$ . [My answer , to the second question in this series of four, quotes passages from an elementary treatment of the existence of branches of $\operatorname{Arg}\gamma$ , of which this is a simple consequence.] Conversely, given any curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ , we can define $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ by $\gamma(t) = \exp(\eta(t)) \ne 0$ ( $a \leqslant t \leqslant b$ ); and then $\eta$ is a branch of $\operatorname{Log}\gamma$ on $[a, b]$ . For any two curves $\gamma, \eta$ that are related in the way just defined, we have: $$ \gamma(b) = -\gamma(a) \text{ if and only if, for some } m \in \mathbb{Z}, \, \eta(b) - \eta(a) = (2m + 1){\pi}i. $$ Suppose that the main conjecture of the present question is true; and that we are given a curve $\gamma \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{C}$ . Let $\eta$ be as just defined in terms of $\gamma$ .  Then, for every positive integer $n$ , $[\eta]$ intersects $[\eta + v]$ , where $$ v = \frac{\eta(b) - \eta(a)}{(2m + 1)n} = \frac{i\pi}{n}. $$ But $[\gamma] = \exp([\eta])$ , and $[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big] = \exp([\eta] + v) = \exp([\eta + v])$ ; therefore $[\gamma]$ intersects $[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big]$ , as required. There is also a partial converse.  Suppose now that the ""slightly weaker"" conjecture is true; and that we are given a curve $\eta \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}^2$ . If $\eta(b) = \eta(a)$ , there is nothing to prove, so from now on we suppose that $\eta(b) \ne \eta(a)$ . The truth-value of the proposition concerning $\eta$ is unaffected by translation, rotation, and scaling, so we can assume without loss of generality that $\eta(a) = 0$ and $\eta(b) = i\pi$ . Now let $\gamma$ be defined in terms of $\eta$ as above.  Because $\gamma(a) = 1$ and $\gamma(b) = -1$ , we can apply the given conjecture, concluding that $[\gamma] \cap \big[e^{i\pi/n}\gamma\big] \ne 0$ . Unfortunately, all we can deduce from this is that for every positive integer $n$ , there exists an integer $m$ such that $\eta$ intersects $\eta + \left(2m + \frac1n\right)(\eta(b) - \eta(a))$ . If there is an argument that enables us to recover the full conjecture from this unsatisfactory result, I haven't thought of it yet.  This explains, I hope, what I meant by saying that the second conjecture is ""slightly weaker"" than the main one; also, why I said at the outset that the answers to the second question in the series ""almost"" prove this question's main conjecture in the case $n = 2$ . $\square$ Experiments by several users drawing polygonal paths in GeoGebra [other programs are available!] have so far failed to produce a counterexample to the conjecture (expressed in the ""weaker"" form).

18,Where can I find out more about the nature of holes in plane regions?,Where can I find out more about the nature of holes in plane regions?,,"Over the last few months I have been studying tilings of regions by polyominoes (mostly dominoes). I have been putting my findings together, mostly in the form of proving various things about polyomino regions and their tilings. But a few times now I had to gloss over some details, all which seem to me related. These seem obvious, but I would like to have a list of properties / facts that I can rely on to reason more confidently. Here are some examples of the types of things I am interested in: Distinguishing the outside border from the borders of holes. If we have polyomino region that can be extended arbitrarily at specified edges on the outside border, without any new cells neighboring cells of the original region except at the specified cells, then the extensions can connect with each other only on specific ways without overlap (for example, if we have four extendable edges 0, 1, 2, 3 in clockwise order, and the extensions at 0 and 2 connect somewhere outside the original region, then the extensions at 1, and 3 cannot also connect outside the figure) if extensions connect up in a certain way, it forces some holes to form. Holes are simply-connected. One hole cannot surround another in a connected region (or overlap). Part of it has to do with choosing a suitable definition of polyomino, and then a suitable definition of hole.

I have been putting my findings together, mostly in the form of proving various things about polyomino regions and their tilings. But a few times now I had to gloss over some details, all which seem to me related. These seem obvious, but I would like to have a list of properties / facts that I can rely on to reason more confidently. Here are some examples of the types of things I am interested in: Distinguishing the outside border from the borders of holes. If we have polyomino region that can be extended arbitrarily at specified edges on the outside border, without any new cells neighboring cells of the original region except at the specified cells, then the extensions can connect with each other only on specific ways without overlap (for example, if we have four extendable edges 0, 1, 2, 3 in clockwise order, and the extensions at 0 and 2 connect somewhere outside the original region, then the extensions at 1, and 3 cannot also connect outside the figure) if extensions connect up in a certain way, it forces some holes to form. Holes are simply-connected. One hole cannot surround another in a connected region (or overlap). Part of it has to do with choosing a suitable definition of polyomino, and then a suitable definition of hole.

19,Operator characterizations of continuity and “co-continuity”,Operator characterizations of continuity and “co-continuity”,,"$\let \op \operatorname$There are several characterizations of continuity of a map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces of the form $f^•[\op{op} A] \diamond \op{op} f^•[A]$ for every $A ⊆ X$ or $Y$ where $f^• ∈ \{f, f^{-1}, f^∀\}$ denotes image, preimage, and dual image ($f^∀[A] := Y \setminus f[X \setminus A]$), $\op{op} ∈ \{\op{cl}, \op{int}\}$ denotes the closure or interior operator, and $\diamond ∈ \{⊆, ⊇\}$ denotes the inclusion in either direction. This gives $3 × 2 × 2 = 12$ combinations. By using some symmetries and dualities, it is easy to show that some conditions are equivalent. Namely, the following conditions correspond to continuity, i.e. $f^{-1}[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ Y$, or equivalently $f^{-1}[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ Y$: $f[\op{cl}(A)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{int}(A)] ⊇ \op{int}(f^∀[A])$, $f^{-1}[\op{cl}(B)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f^{-1}[B])$, $f^{-1}[\op{int}(B)] ⊆ \op{int}(f^{-1}[B])$. The following conditions correspond to closedness, i.e. $f[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ X$: $f[\op{cl}(A)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{int}(A)] ⊆ \op{int}(f^∀[A])$. The following conditions correspond to openness, i.e. $f[U]$ is open for every open $U ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[F]$ is closed for every closed $F ⊆ X$: $f[\op{int}(A)] ⊆ \op{int}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{cl}(A)] ⊇ \op{cl}(f^∀[A])$, $f^{-1}[\op{int}(B)] ⊇ \op{int}(f^{-1}[B])$, $f^{-1}[\op{cl}(B)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f^{-1}[B])$. The remaining two conditions are also equivalent and correspond to what I call “co-continuity” here: $f[\op{int}(A)] ⊇ \op{int}(f[A])$, $f^∀[\op{cl}(A)] ⊆ \op{cl}(f^∀[A])$. The question: Is this co-continuity condition present somewhere in the literature? Does it have some nice properties? Or is there a reason why it is not interesting? For now, I have made the following observations: Co-continuous maps are stable under compositions, and similarly to continuity, it is easier to achieve if the domain topology is finer and if the co-domain topology is coarser. The map $f: X \to Y$ is co-continuous if for every open (in $Y$) $U ⊆ f[X]$ and every $f$-section $s: U \to X$ (i.e. $f ∘ s = \op{id}_U$) the set $s[U]$ is also open. In particular, if $f$ is co-continous, then $f^{-1}(y)$ is open discrete for every isolated point $y ∈ Y$. If $f$ is co-continuous then $f^{-1}[U]$ is open for every open (in $Y$) $U ⊆ f[X]$, so for surjective maps, co-continuity implies continuity. On the other hand, for injective maps, continuity implies co-continuity. $f$ is co-continuous with respect to the topology $τ$ on $Y$ if and only if it is co-continuous with respect to $τ' := \{U ∈ τ: U ⊆ f[X]\} ∪ \{Y\}$. And $τ'$-co-continuity implies $τ'$-continuity. (Similarly, $τ$-continuity is equivalent to $τ''$-continuity where $τ''$ makes $f[X]$ open and every $y ∈ Y \setminus f[X]$ isolated. Also, $τ''$-co-continuity implies $τ''$-continuity.) In general, if $f[X]$ is open, then co-continuity implies continuity. On the other hand, if $f[X]$ has empty interior, then co-continuity is trivial. If $f$ is co-continuous, then $f[C]$ is co-dense for every co-dense $C ⊆ X$, or equivalently $f^∀[D]$ is dense for every dense $D ⊆ X$.","$\let \op \operatorname$There are several characterizations of continuity of a map $f: X \to Y$ between topological spaces of the form $f^•[\op{op} A] \diamond \op{op} f^•[A]$ for every $A ⊆ X$ or $Y$ where $f^• ∈ \{f, f^{-1}, f^∀\}$ denotes image, preimage, and dual image ($f^∀[A] := Y \setminus f[X \setminus A]$), $\op{op} ∈ \{\op{cl}, \op{int}\}$ denotes the closure or interior operator, and $\diamond ∈ \{⊆, ⊇\}$ denotes the inclusion in either direction.

Question 6 : I think with my topological space definition it follows that a closed operator is uniquely defined by its values on a core provided that the spaces are first countable and Hausdorff. Proof: Relies on the following results A convergent sequence in Hausdorff space has a unique limit. If a space is first countable, $C$ is closed and $D$ is dense in $C$ then any point  in $C$ is the limit of a convergent sequence of points in $D$. The product topology of two first-countable spaces is first-countable Firstly assert that if $f :D(f) \subset X \to Y$ and $G $ is a dense subset of $G(f) =  \{(x, f(x)): x \in D(f)\}$ in the product topology then $\overline G = G(f)$. This follows since $X \times Y$ is first countable so any $(x, f(x))$ is the limit of a sequence $(x_n, f(x_n))$ in $G$ and being Hausdorff this limit is unique. Then let $f,g$ be two closed functions $f:D(f) \subset X \to Y$ and $g:D(g) \subset X \to Y$ with $D$ a core for both and $f = g$ on $D$. Then $G =  \{x, f(x): x \in D\} =  \{x, g(x): x \in D\}$ is dense in $G(f)$ and $G(g)$ So  $G(f) = G(g) = \overline G \implies f = g$ on $D(f) = D(g)$.","I first saw a reference to the core of an unbounded linear operator in the context of Hilbert space and subsequently in the more general context of Banach space. The definition here https://math.stackexchange.com/q/716486 ..... ""For $D \subseteq D(T)$ to be a core for $T$, what you want is $\{(x,Tx): x \in D\}$ to be dense in the graph $\{(x,Tx): x \in D(T)\}$ of $T$ (as subsets of ${\mathscr H} \times {\mathscr H}$, with the norm topology)."" .....  is in the context of Hilbert space, but only refers to the norm, so presumably applies equally in Banach space. Question 1 : In some references I can find it is required that $D$ is a subspace while others just identify it as a subset ? Question 2 :  I think I could adapt the definition given to a purely topological context and say ""For first-countable Hausdorff topological spaces $(X, \mathscr T)$ and $(Y, \mathscr S)$ and a partially defined function $f: D(f) \subset X \to Y$ then $D \subset D(f)$ is a core for $f$ if $G(f|_D) = \{x, f(x): x \in D\}$ is dense in $G(f) =  \{x, f(x): x \in D(f)\}$ with the product topology on $(X \times Y)$"" I think this reduces to the Banach space definition since the norm topology on ${\mathscr H} \times {\mathscr H}$ is just the product space topology, but I   can't find any reference to confirm or contradict this and would appreciate feedback. Question 3 : taking the Banach space definition, it seems that if $D$ is a core for $T$ then $D$ is a dense in $D(T)$ but the converse doesn't necessarily hold  - correct ? Question 4 : I think I get the same result $D$ is a core for $f \implies D$ is a dense in $D(f)$ with my topological definition - correct ? Proof: Let $x \in D(T)$ so that $(x, f(x)) \in G(f)$ If $O_X$ is any open set containing $x$ and $O_Y$ is any open set containing $f(x)$ then $O_X \times O_Y $ is an open set in the product topology and contains some point $(x_D, f(x_D))$ with $x_D \in O_X \implies D$ is dense in $D(f)$.

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ consisting of all sequences $x$ such that $\sum x_i^2$ converges. Then the formula    $$ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( x_i - y_i \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} $$   defines a metric on $X$. . . . On $X$ we have the three topologies it inherits from the box, uniform, and product topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. We have also the topology given by the metric $d$, which we call the $\ell^2$-topology. . . . (a) Show that on $X$, we have the inclusions    $$ \mbox{ box topology } \supset \ell^2\mbox{-topology } \supset \mbox{ uniform topology}. \tag{0} $$ This I've managed to do. (b) The set $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ of all sequences that are eventually zero is contained in $X$. Show that the four topologies that $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ inherits as a subspace of $X$ are all distinct. My Attempt: The set $\prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right)$, for example, is open in the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$; so the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[  \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3 , 1/k^3 \right) \right]$ is open in the corresponding subspace topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$; the zero sequence $\mathbb{0} \colon= (0, 0, 0, \ldots)$ is in this set, but for any $\delta > 0$, we note that if $n$ is any natural number such that $n > 2/\delta$, then the element $$\mathbf{x} \colon= \left(\underbrace{ 1/n^3,  \ldots, 1/n^3 }_{n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots  \right)$$    is in $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, \delta) \colon=  \left\{ \ \mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$   because    $$ d ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n 1/n^3 } = 1/n < \delta/2 < \delta, $$   but $\mathbf{x} \not\in \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right),$   because    $ 1/n^3 \not\in \left( -1/n^3, 1/n^3 \right)$,    and hence    $\mathbf{x} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$. Thus although $\mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$, no $d$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""box topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is not open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". From part (a), we can conclude that the corresponding subspace topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ also satisfy these very inclusion relations as in (0) above. So we can conclude that on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, the ""box topology"" is strictly finer than the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". Is what I have done so far correct? The set    $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ) = \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < 1 \ \right\}$$    is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and contains the point $\mathbf{0}$. However, for any real number $\delta > 0$, if we take a natural number $n > 4/\delta^2$, then the point    $$ \mathbf{p} \colon= \left( \underbrace{ \delta/2, \ldots, \delta/2}_{ n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots \right) $$    is in    $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{ \bar{\rho} } ( \mathbf{0}, \delta ) \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$   because    $$ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) \leq \delta/2 < \delta, $$   but    $$ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) =  \frac{\delta}{2} \sqrt{ n} > 1,$$   and so    $$ \mathbf{p} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ).$$ Thus, although the point $\mathbf{0}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 )$, no $\bar{\rho}$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, is not open in the ""$\bar{\rho}$-topology""; therefore the former topology is strictly finer than the latter one. Is this portion of my proof correct? The product topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is the same as the topology induced by the metric $D$ on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ given by the formula   $$ D ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) = \sup \left\{ \ \frac{ \min \left\{ \ \left\lvert x_n -y_n \right\rvert, \ 1 \ \right\} }{ n } \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}. $$ Now the set $$\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}}  ( \mathbf{0}, 1/2 )  \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < 1/2 \ \right\}$$   is open in the ""uniform topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and contains the point $\mathbf{0}$. However, for any real number $\delta > 0$, if we take $n$ to be any natural number such that $n > 1/\delta$, then the point    $$ \mathbf{p} \colon= \left( \underbrace{ 0, \ldots, 0}_{ n-1 \mbox{ terms } }, 1, 0, 0, \ldots \right)$$    is in the set    $$\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_D ( \mathbf{0}, \delta) \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ D( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$   because    $$ D( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) = \frac{1}{n} < \delta,  $$   but    $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) = 1 > \frac{1}{2} $$   so that    $$ \mathbf{p} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0}, 1/2 ),$$   thus showing that, although the point $\mathbf{0}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$, for no $\delta > 0$ is the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_D ( \mathbf{0}, \delta)$ contained in     $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$. Thus the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{\bar{\rho}} (\mathbf{0} , 1/2 )$, which is open in the ""unifrom topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, is not open in the ""product topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$. Since the uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is (strictly) finer than the product topology (i.e. the $D$-metric topology) on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, so the subspace topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ corresponding to the former topology is finer than the subspace topology corresponding to the latter, and, on the basis of what we have shown in the last few paragraphs, the ""unifrom topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is strictly finer than the ""product topology"". Is this part of my proof correct? Therefore, we have shown that all the four topologies in question are distinct. Is my proof accurate? If so, is my presentation clear enough too?","Here is Prob. 8, Sec. 20, in the book Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be the subset of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ consisting of all sequences $x$ such that $\sum x_i^2$ converges. Then the formula    $$ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left( x_i - y_i \right)^2 \right]^{1/2} $$   defines a metric on $X$. . . . On $X$ we have the three topologies it inherits from the box, uniform, and product topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. We have also the topology given by the metric $d$, which we call the $\ell^2$-topology. . . . (a) Show that on $X$, we have the inclusions    $$ \mbox{ box topology } \supset \ell^2\mbox{-topology } \supset \mbox{ uniform topology}. \tag{0} $$ This I've managed to do. (b) The set $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ of all sequences that are eventually zero is contained in $X$. Show that the four topologies that $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ inherits as a subspace of $X$ are all distinct. My Attempt: The set $\prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right)$, for example, is open in the box topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$; so the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[  \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3 , 1/k^3 \right) \right]$ is open in the corresponding subspace topology on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$; the zero sequence $\mathbb{0} \colon= (0, 0, 0, \ldots)$ is in this set, but for any $\delta > 0$, we note that if $n$ is any natural number such that $n > 2/\delta$, then the element $$\mathbf{x} \colon= \left(\underbrace{ 1/n^3,  \ldots, 1/n^3 }_{n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots  \right)$$    is in $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, \delta) \colon=  \left\{ \ \mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$   because    $$ d ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n 1/n^3 } = 1/n < \delta/2 < \delta, $$   but $\mathbf{x} \not\in \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/k^3 \right),$   because    $ 1/n^3 \not\in \left( -1/n^3, 1/n^3 \right)$,    and hence    $\mathbf{x} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$. Thus although $\mathbf{0} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap \left[ \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( -1/k^3, 1/K^3 \right) \right]$, no $d$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""box topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ is not open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". From part (a), we can conclude that the corresponding subspace topologies on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ also satisfy these very inclusion relations as in (0) above. So we can conclude that on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, the ""box topology"" is strictly finer than the ""$\ell^2$-topology"". Is what I have done so far correct? The set    $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ) = \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ d( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < 1 \ \right\}$$    is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and contains the point $\mathbf{0}$. However, for any real number $\delta > 0$, if we take a natural number $n > 4/\delta^2$, then the point    $$ \mathbf{p} \colon= \left( \underbrace{ \delta/2, \ldots, \delta/2}_{ n \mbox{ terms } }, 0, 0, 0, \ldots \right) $$    is in    $$ \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B_{ \bar{\rho} } ( \mathbf{0}, \delta ) \colon= \left\{ \ \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^\infty \ \colon \ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{0} ) < \delta \ \right\}, $$   because    $$ \bar{\rho} ( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) \leq \delta/2 < \delta, $$   but    $$ d( \mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0} ) =  \frac{\delta}{2} \sqrt{ n} > 1,$$   and so    $$ \mathbf{p} \not\in \mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 ).$$ Thus, although the point $\mathbf{0}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\infty \cap B ( \mathbf{0}, 1 )$, no $\bar{\rho}$-metric open ball in $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ about $\mathbf{0}$ is contained in this set, showing that this set, which is open in the ""$\ell^2$-topology"" on $\mathbb{R}^\infty$, is not open in the ""$\bar{\rho}$-topology""; therefore the former topology is strictly finer than the latter one.

The Alaoglu's Theorem: Let $X$ be a normed space. Then ball $X^*$ is weak-star compact. Proof:Let $D_x=\{\alpha\in\mathbb{F}:|\alpha|\leqslant1\}$ for each $x\in$ ball $X$. Let $$D=\prod\{D_x:x\in\textrm{ball } X\}.$$ Since $D_x$ is compact, by Tychonoff's Theorem, $D$ is compact. For each $x\in$ ball $X$, define $\tau:\textrm{ball } X^*\rightarrow D$ by $\tau(x^*)(x)=\langle x,x^*\rangle$. That is, $\tau(x^*)$ is the element of the product space $D$ whose $x$ coordinate is $\langle x,x^*\rangle$. Let $x^*\in \textrm{ball } X^*$ and let $(x_i^*)$ be a net in ball $X^*$ with $x_i^*\rightarrow x^*$. Then for each $x\in$ ball $X$, $$\tau(x_i^*)(x)=\langle x,x_i^*\rangle\rightarrow\langle x,x^*\rangle=\tau(x^*)(x).$$ That is, each coordinate of $\{\tau(x_i^*)\}$ converges to $\tau(x^*)$. Hence, $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)$ in $D$. Therefore, $\tau:\textrm{ball } X^*\rightarrow D$ is continuous. Let $\tau(x_1^*)=\tau(x_2^*)$ for $x_1^*,x_2^*\in \textrm{ball } X^*$. Then $\langle x,x_1^*\rangle=\langle x,x_2^*\rangle$ for each $x\in$ ball $X$, and thus $x_1^*=x_2^*$. Hence, $\tau$ is injective. It implies that $\tau^{-1}$ exists. Let $\tau(x^*)\in D$ and let $\tau(x_i^*)$ be a net in $D$ with $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)$. Then for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$, $\tau(x_i^*)(x)\rightarrow\tau(x^*)(x)$. Thus $\langle x,x_i^*\rangle\rightarrow\langle x,x^*\rangle$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$. Hence, $x_i^*\rightarrow x^*$ in ball $X^*$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$. Therefore, $\tau^{-1}:D\rightarrow\textrm{ball } X^*$ is continuous. Since the map from $\textrm{ball } X^*$ to $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is bijective, $\tau$ is a homeomorphism from $\textrm{ball } X^*$ onto $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$. Let $f\in D$ and let $(x_i^*)$ be a net in ball $X^*$ such that $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow f$ in $D$. Then $f(x)=\lim\langle x,x_i^*\rangle$ exists for every $x\in$ ball $X$. Now we extend $f$ to $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{F}$. Let $\alpha>0$ be such that $\|\alpha x\|\leqslant1$ for all $x\in X$. Then define $F(x)=\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x)$. If also $\beta>0$ such that $\|\beta x\| \leqslant1$ for all $x\in X$, then $$\alpha^{-1}f(\alpha x) = \alpha^{-1} \lim \langle\alpha x, x_i^*\rangle=\beta^{-1}\lim\langle\beta x, x_i^*\rangle = \beta^{-1}f(\beta x).$$ Hence, $F(x)$ is well defined.

Since $f\in D$, $f(x)\in D_x$ for all $x\in$ ball $X$. Thus $|f(x)|\leqslant1$ for all $x\in \textrm{ball } X$.  Now let $\alpha=\frac{1}{\|x\|}$ for $x\in X-\{0\}$. Then $F(x)=\|x\|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})$. Since $\frac{x}{\|x\|}\in \textrm{ball } X$, $|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})|\leqslant1$. Thus $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for $x\in X-\{0\}$. If $x=0$, $F(x)=0$. Hence, $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for all $x\in X$. It implies that $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{F}$ is a linear bounded functional and $\|F\|\leqslant1$; that is, $F\in\textrm{ball } X^*$. For any $x\in \textrm{ball } X$, we have $\tau(F)(x)=\langle x,F\rangle=f(x)$. It follows that $f\in \tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$. Since $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow f$, $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is closed in $D$. Thus $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is compact.

Then $F(x)=\|x\|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})$. Since $\frac{x}{\|x\|}\in \textrm{ball } X$, $|f(\frac{x}{\|x\|})|\leqslant1$. Thus $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for $x\in X-\{0\}$. If $x=0$, $F(x)=0$. Hence, $\|F(x)\|\leqslant\|x\|$ for all $x\in X$. It implies that $F:X\rightarrow\mathbb{F}$ is a linear bounded functional and $\|F\|\leqslant1$; that is, $F\in\textrm{ball } X^*$. For any $x\in \textrm{ball } X$, we have $\tau(F)(x)=\langle x,F\rangle=f(x)$. It follows that $f\in \tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$. Since $\tau(x_i^*)\rightarrow f$, $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is closed in $D$. Thus $\tau(\textrm{ball } X^*)$ is compact. Therefore, ball $X^*$ is weak-star compact.",,"['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'normed-spaces']"

Thus $q(\mathcal{B})$ is indeed a basis for $\tau_q$. $\blacksquare$ Edit: I just realized this certainly does not solve for the general case, derp. It still seems quite useful to not appear though. For instance, the typical question of the quotient of $\mathbb{R}^2$ by $(x,y)\sim(a,b)\Leftrightarrow x^2+y^2=a^2+b^2$ can be seen to be an open map, since every 'open box' in $\mathbb{R}^2$ maps to open intervals in $[0,\infty)$, so the intervals $[0, x)$ and $(a, b)$ with $a$ positive form a basis.","I was studying some basic topology and was wondering about the basis for a quotient topology.

($\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) Theorem: All norms on $X$ are equivalent. Proof: $a_k$s and $c_k$s will refer to elements of $\mathbb{F}$. Let $(e_k)_{k=0}^{n-1}$ be a basis of $X$. Define $\lVert \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k e_k \rVert_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |c_k|$. Evidently $\lVert \cdot \rVert_1$ is a norm. Let $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ be another norm on $X$. Then if we define $c_0 = 1/\max(\lVert e_k \rVert)_{k=0}^{n-1}$, for $x = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k e_k$, $$ c_0\lVert x \rVert = c_0\left\lVert \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k e_k \right\rVert \leq c_0 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |a_k| \lVert e_k \rVert \leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |a_k| = \lVert x \rVert_1 $$ Conversely, observe that if $c_1 > 0$ so that $\lVert x \rVert_1 \leq c_1 \lVert x \rVert$, (We may assume that $\lVert x \rVert_1 \neq 0$ by the identity of indiscernibles) $$ 1 = \frac{\lVert x \rVert_1}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \leq \frac{c}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \lVert x \rVert = c_1\left\lVert \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \right\rVert $$ so it suffices to show that $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ is bounded below on the unit sphere $S =\{x \in X\mid \lVert x \rVert_1 = 1\}$. However, this is the part I'm having trouble with. Obviously if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$, I can use the fact that every bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is totally bounded, and thus show the compactness of $S$.(which implies every sequence of norms on $S$ has a convergent subsequence) But what if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$?

($\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) Theorem: All norms on $X$ are equivalent. Proof: $a_k$s and $c_k$s will refer to elements of $\mathbb{F}$. Let $(e_k)_{k=0}^{n-1}$ be a basis of $X$. Define $\lVert \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k e_k \rVert_1 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |c_k|$. Evidently $\lVert \cdot \rVert_1$ is a norm. Let $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ be another norm on $X$. Then if we define $c_0 = 1/\max(\lVert e_k \rVert)_{k=0}^{n-1}$, for $x = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k e_k$, $$ c_0\lVert x \rVert = c_0\left\lVert \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k e_k \right\rVert \leq c_0 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |a_k| \lVert e_k \rVert \leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |a_k| = \lVert x \rVert_1 $$ Conversely, observe that if $c_1 > 0$ so that $\lVert x \rVert_1 \leq c_1 \lVert x \rVert$, (We may assume that $\lVert x \rVert_1 \neq 0$ by the identity of indiscernibles) $$ 1 = \frac{\lVert x \rVert_1}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \leq \frac{c}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \lVert x \rVert = c_1\left\lVert \frac{x}{\lVert x \rVert_1} \right\rVert $$ so it suffices to show that $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ is bounded below on the unit sphere $S =\{x \in X\mid \lVert x \rVert_1 = 1\}$. However, this is the part I'm having trouble with. Obviously if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$, I can use the fact that every bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is totally bounded, and thus show the compactness of $S$.(which implies every sequence of norms on $S$ has a convergent subsequence) But what if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$? How does the argument work here? Also, the sequence of norms mentioned earlier converges iff $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ is continuous, which is what I'm trying to show.",,"['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'equivalent-metrics']"

First observation , if $K$ is a subset of some $\mathbb{R}^n$ , then setting $j$ as the inclusion, we retrieve the definition of a retract, i.e exists a retraction which leaves $K=K'$ untouched. And now the my reasoning. According to my understandings, any retract $K$ of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ seems to be an ENR according to def. 2. Then noticing that any open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is trivially ENR, we can apply the following result [tom Dieck Proposition 18.4.3] Proposition 18.4.3 Let $X$ be an ENR.

So to recap, I drew these conclusions: 1) In the case $X \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ , ENR if an only if Deformation retract (up to restriction of the open nbd) 2) In the general case, if the nbd of $X$ is ENR on its own, then (up to restriction)the two notions are equivalent.
