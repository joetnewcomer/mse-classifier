2,A doubt in the proof of Frucht's theorem,A doubt in the proof of Frucht's theorem,,"I am trying to understand the proof of Frucht's theorem which is: Every finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of some   simple graph. The proof (which I am reading from this book) begins as follows: Let $\Gamma=\{g_1,\cdots, g_n\}$ be a group. Consider a directed graph $\hat{G_0}$ with $V(\hat{G_0})=\Gamma$ and a directed edge between $g_i$ and $g_j$ colored $k$ where $g_ig_j^{-1}=g_k$. Next it goes on to show that $Aut(\hat{G_0})\approx\Gamma$. Next, a graph $G$ is constructed: Whenever $g_i$ has a directed edge leading into $g_j$ of color $k$, then that edge is replaced by a (non-directed) path of length $k+2$. In this $k+2$-path there are paths of length $1$ attached to each inner point except for the inner point next to $g_j$ where we attach a path of length $2$. Then the following is established: Each automorphism of $\hat{G_0}$ induces a unique automorphism of $G$. If $\alpha$ is an automorphism of $G$, then $\alpha$ is induced by some automorphism of $\hat{G_0}$. This finishes the proof. What I don't understand is as the last two points presumably only establish that $Aut(\hat{G_0})$ and $Aut(G)$ have the same cardinality. It doesn't establish that they are isomorphic as groups which is essential for the final conclusion that $Aut(G)\approx \Gamma$. Update: There is no proof of (1) provided in the book. Instead it just says that the proof is clear! I assume what is meant is this: For any automorphism $f$ of $\hat{G_0}$, we construct an automorphism of $G$ by first permuting $V(G_0)$ as per $f$, then rearranging the paths appropriately (the path joining $g_i$ and $g_j$ is send to the path joining $f(g_i)$ and $f(g_j)$. The structure of the paths is such that there is no permutation possible within a particular path.).","I am trying to understand the proof of Frucht's theorem which is: Every finite group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of some   simple graph.

3,Basis of $SL_q(2)$,Basis of,SL_q(2),"While trying to show that $SL_q(2)$ is noncocommutative, I needed to prove the following fact: Show that the set $\{a^ib^jc^k\}_{i,j,k\geq 0}\cup\{b^ic^jd^k\}_{i,j\geq 0,k>0}$ is a basis of $SL_q(2)$. I was stuck with proving the above fact. (Incidentally, the above is exercise IV.9.7 in Kassel's book on Quantum Groups.) I have tried to search for a similar proof in the book, and found that Lemma IV.4.5 is rather similar ($\{a^ib^jc^kd^l\}_{i,j,k,l\geq 0}$ is a basis of $M_q(2)$).

10,Extensions of Height-Preserving Isomorphisms in Ulm's Theorem,Extensions of Height-Preserving Isomorphisms in Ulm's Theorem,,"I am working through the proof of Ulm's Theorem in Kaplansky's book ``Infinite Abelian Groups."" Ulm's theorem states that two countable reduced abelian $p$ -groups $G,H$ with the same Ulm invariants are isomorphic. Kaplansky's particular proof of Ulm's theorem is important because it is often used, word-for-word, to prove similar classification theorems for other kinds of structures. The key step in this proof is to extend a given height-preserving isomorphism to another height-preserving isomorphism. The part I'm confused about has nothing to do with the Ulm invariants or the fact that these groups are reduced, so please excuse me if I don't define these notions. However, central to the proof is the notion of height. We can define, inductively, $G_0 = G$ , $G_{\alpha + 1} = pG_{\alpha}$ , and $G_{\alpha}$ for limit $\alpha$ is defined in the obvious way by taking intersections. For $x \in G$ , we define the height of $x$ , denoted $h(x)$ , to be $\infty$ if $x=0$ and $\alpha$ if $x \in G_{\alpha}$ but not $G_{\alpha + 1}$ . It can be easily shown that if $h(x) \neq h(y)$ then $h(x+y) =$ min $(h(x),h(y))$ and  if $h(x) = h(y)$ then $h(x+y) \geq h(x)$ . The proof proceeds in stages. At stage $n$ , we start with a height-preserving isomorphism $V:S \rightarrow T$ between finite subgroups $S,T$ of $G,H$ respectively. We then take an arbitrary element $x$ of $G$ and extend $V$ to include $x$ in its domain. We are allowed to assume that i) $x \not \in S$ but $px \in S$ , ii) $x$ is proper with respect to $S$ , meaning that $h(x) \geq h(x+s)$ for all $s \in S$ , and iii) $h(px) \geq h(p(x+s))$ for all $s \in S$ . We then find an element $w \in H$ such that $w \not \in T$ , $pw = V(px)$ , $h(w) = h(x)$ , and $w$ is proper with respect to $T$ . Extending $V$ in the obvious way we get a map $V': \langle S,x \rangle \rightarrow \langle T,w \rangle$ , which should still be an isomorphism and height-preserving. My question is: Why is $V'$ height-preserving? Note that all heights are supposed to be calculated with respect to the larger groups $G,H$ . Now, an arbitrary element of $\langle S,x \rangle$ is of the form $s \pm nx$ . Since for any $x$ , $h(x) = h(-x)$ , it suffices to show that $V'$ preserves the height of an element of the form $s+nx$ . Moreover since $px \in S$ we may assume $n < p$ . That is, we want to show that $$ h(nx+s) = h(nw + V(s)).$$ So far, I have only been able to show that $h(x+s) = h(w+V(s))$ , which follows since $h(x+s) =$ min $(h(x), h(s))$ by the fact that $x$ is proper with respect to $S$ . There is also a proof of Ulm's theorem in Fuchs' ``Infinite Abelian Groups"", which seems to claim that this fact is enough to conclude that $V'$ is height-preserving. I don't understand this at all; there doesn't seem to be any clear connection between $h(nx+s)$ and $h(x+s)$ .  Even ignoring this advice, I am pretty stuck since height does not seem to be well-behaved with respect to addition.","I am working through the proof of Ulm's Theorem in Kaplansky's book ``Infinite Abelian Groups.""

For all $g,h \in G$ : $gh \in N \iff hg \in N$ . Assume the contrary that there exist $n\in N$ and $g \in G$ such that $gng^{-1} \notin N$ . Then $g^{-1} (gn) = n\notin N$ by (a). This is a contradiction. For all $g \in G$ : $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N$ . Substituting $g$ for $g^{-1}$ in $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N$ , we get $g^{-1}  N g\subseteq N$ . Substituting $N$ for $g^{-1} N g$ in $gNg^{-1} \subseteq N$ , we get $N \subseteq g^{-1} N g$ . As a result, $g^{-1} N g = N$ . Substituting $g$ for $g^{-1}$ in $g^{-1} N g = N$ , we get the desired result. For all $g \in G$ : $gNg^{-1} = N$ . It follows from (c) that $gN= Ng$ . The result then follows. The sets of left and right cosets of $N$ in $G$ coincide. Because of (d) and the fact that $h \in hN \cap Nh$ , we have $hN=Nh$ . It follows from $x \in gN$ and $y \in hN$ that $x = gn_1$ and $y = hn_2$ for some $n_1,n_2 \in N$ . Then $xy = gn_1 hn_2$ . Because $Nh = hN$ , $n_1 h = h n_3$ for some $n_3 \in N$ . Then $xy = g h n_3 n_2 = (gh) (n_3 n_2) \in (gh) N$ . For all $x,y,g,h \in G$ : $x \in gN$ and $y \in hN \implies xy \in (gh)N$ . We have $n^{-1} g^{-1} n \in n^{-1} g^{-1} N$ and $g \in gN$ . Then by (e), we have $n^{-1} g^{-1} n g \in (n^{-1} g^{-1} g)N = n^{-1} N = N$ . For all $n \in N, g \in G$ : $n^{-1} g^{-1} n g \in N$ . Substituting $g$ for $g^{-1}$ in $n^{-1} g^{-1} n g \in N$ , we get $n^{-1} g n g^{-1}  \in N$ . Because $n^{-1} \in N$ , we have $g n g^{-1}  \in N$ . For all $n \in N, g \in G$ : $g n g^{-1} \in N$ . It follows from (g) that $\operatorname{Cl}(n) \subseteq N$ for all $n \in N$ . Then $\bigcup_{n \in N} \operatorname{Cl}(n) \subseteq N$ . On the other hand, $n \in \operatorname{Cl}(n)$ and thus $N \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in N} \operatorname{Cl}(n)$ . The result the follows. $N = \bigcup_{n \in N} \operatorname{Cl}(n)$ where $\operatorname{Cl}(n) := \{gng^{-1} \mid g \in G\}$ . It follows from (h) that $\operatorname{Cl}(n) \subseteq N$ for all $n \in N$ .  As a result, for all $g \in G, n \in N$ , we have $g n g^{-1} = n'$ for some $n' \in N$ . Hence $gn=n'g$ for some $n' \in N$ . Thus $gN \subseteq Ng$ . By symmetry, we also have $Ng \subseteq gN$ . The result then follows. For all $g \in G$ : $gN = Ng$ . Let $G/N := \{gN \mid g \in G\}$ . We define a binary operation $G/N \times G/N \to G/N$ by $(gN) (hN) \mapsto (gh)N$ . Let's prove that it's well-defined, i.e. $gN = aN$ and $hN = bN$ implies $(gh) N = (ab) N$ . We have $gN= aN$ implies $g=an_1$ for some $n_1 \in N$ . Similarly, $h=bn_2$ for some $n_2 \in N$ . Then $gh = an_1bn_2$ . It follows from (i) that $Nb=bN$ and thus $n_1b=bn_3$ for some $n_3 \in N$ . Hence $gh =abn_3n_2$ . Because $n_2,n_3 \in N$ , we have $n_3n_2 \in N$ and thus $(n_3n_2)N =N$ . As a result, $(gh)N = (abn_3n_2)N = (ab)(n_3n_2)N = (ab)N$ . It's then straightforward to verify that $G/N$ together with above operation is group. Now we define a map $\phi: G \to G/N, g \mapsto gN$ . It's easy to verify that $\phi$ is in fact a group homomorphism such that $\operatorname{ker} \phi = \{g \in G \mid gN = 1N =N\} =N$ . There exists a group homomorphism whose domain is $G$ and kernel is $N$ . Let $\phi: G \to K$ be such a group homomorphism that $\operatorname{ker} \phi = N$ . If $gh \in N$ then $\phi (gh) = \phi(g) \phi (h) = 1$ . This means $\phi(g) = (\phi(h))^{-1}$ . As a result, $\phi (hg) = \phi(h) \phi (g) = \phi(h) (\phi(h))^{-1} = 1$ and thus $hg \in N$ . By symmetry, we have $hg \in N \implies gh \in N$ . This completes the proof. For all $g,h \in G$ : $gh \in N \iff hg \in N$ .","I've found various equivalent definitions of normal subgroup from this Wikipedia page . I've just finished proving their equivalence.

27,"""Factoring Behavior"" of a cubic polynomial mod $p$","""Factoring Behavior"" of a cubic polynomial mod",p,"Given an irreducible polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients, I want to characterize all the primes $p$ based on how $f(x)$ factors $\mod p$ . For quadratic polynomials, it follows directly from the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity. Specifically, if $f(x)$ has discriminant $D$ , then $f(x)$ splits completely $\mod p$ ( $p>2$ ) precisely when $D$ is a square $\mod p$ and remains irreducible otherwise. I want to generalize this as much as I can for the case where $f(x)$ is a cubic polynomial. Specifically, I want to determine for which primes, $f$ splits, remains irreducible, or factors as a product of a linear and quadratic polynomial. Any hints, full or partial solutions, or references to papers or textbooks with ideas that could help me would be greatly appreciated! Here's what I've done so far: Let $f(x)$ be an irreducible cubic polynomial with integer coefficients. Let $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ be the roots and $D = (\alpha-\beta)^2(\beta-\gamma)^2(\alpha-\gamma)^2$ its discriminant. Let $p$ be a prime. For simplicity, I'm assuming $p>3$ and that $p \nmid D$ . Let $K/\mathbb{Q}$ be its splitting field and $G$ its Galois group. Let $K_p/\mathbb{F}_p$ be the splitting field of $f$ over the finite field with $p$ elements. Case 1: $D = d^2$ for some integer $d$ . In this case, $G$ is cyclic of order 3. This implies that $\beta$ and $\gamma$ can be written as polynomials in $\alpha$ , so we have either $f$ splits completely $\mod p$ , or $f$ remains irreducible. I'm conjecturing that $K \subset \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_d)$ ( $\zeta_d$ is a primitive $d$ -th root of unity) and from there I can obtain congruence conditions for which the polynomial splits. I imagine that this can be proven easily using Class Field Theory, but I'm still in the process of learning it. My main idea so far has been to use Gaussian periods corresponding to index 3 subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z})^\times$ . It worked for all the explicit examples I've checked, but I have no idea how to prove it works in general. Case 2: $D$ is not a square. If $\left(\frac{D}{p}\right) = -1$ , then I'm able to show that $f$ has exactly one root in $\mathbb{F}_p$ as then $\mathbb{F}_p(\sqrt{D})$ is a quadratic subextension of $K_p$ , which implies $K_p$ is itself a quadratic extension. I have no idea how to show the converse statement or if it is even true. If $\left(\frac{D}{p}\right) = 1$ , things get a lot more complicated and this where I'm having the most trouble. In the case $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ , we have that $D = -3\cdot6^2$ . Thus, $$\left(\frac{D}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{-3\cdot6^2}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{-3}{p}\right) = 1 \iff p \equiv 1\mod 3.$$ In this case, I know that there exists integers $A,B$ such that $p = A^2 + 3B^2$ and that $f$ splits $\mod p$ iff $3 | B$ . These congruence conditions were derived from the Law of Cubic Reciprocity, which heavily relies on the Eisenstein integers and $p = A^2 + 3B^2$ being possible because the Eisenstein integers are a UFD. Back to the general case, my first guess has been to write $$kp = A^2 - DB^2$$ for some appropriate $k$ , and then hopefully be able to derive some congruence conditions for $A$ and $B$ . I imagine that this might involve deriving some kind of analogue for Cubic Reciprocity, but the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ would replace the Eisenstein integers. My next idea (which might be more fruitful), is to use modular (or automorphic) forms. Admittedly, I don't know much about them, just a few basic facts like how they form a finite dimensional $\mathbb{C}$ -vector space etc. If I try this, my approach would be to first try to use modular forms (after learning more about them) to try solving the case $f(x) = x^3 - 2$ , replacing $x^2 + 3y^2$ with $$\theta = \sum_{i,j \in \mathbb{Z}} q^{x^2+3y^2}$$ and see if this sheds any light on the general problem.

In this case, the extension is purely inseparable too. I was wondering the following: Is it possible to construct a finite extension of fields $K/F$ which is not simple and such that the purely inseparable closure of $F$ in $K$ is simple? The purely inseparable closure of $F$ in $K$ , denoted $I$ , is defined to be the set of all $\alpha \in K$ that are purely inseparable over $F$ . Similarly, the separable closure of $F$ in $K$ is denoted $S$ and is defined to be the set of all $\alpha \in K$ that are separable over $F$ . One can show that $I$ and $S$ are subfields of $K$ containing $F$ . Can anyone give me a hint on how to construct, or even search for, such an extension? I know that we cannot have $SI = K$ , because we can show from the hypotheses that $SI$ is a simple extension of $F$ . In particular, $K$ cannot be normal over $F$ (see Proposition V.6.11 in Lang's Algebra , page 251, third edition). Moreover, $F$ cannot be perfect because every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable (see Corollary V.6.12 in Lang's Algebra , page 252, third edition), so in particular $F$ cannot be a finite field or have characteristic $0$ . Moreover, this answer by @KConrad on MathOverflow shows that every finite extension of $\Bbb{F}_p(x)$ is simple, so these are also ruled out as candidates for $F$ . I haven't been able to make any progress beyond this, though. I've tried fiddling around with the above standard example of $k(x,y)/k(x^p,y^p)$ , but no matter how I make $K/F$ non-simple I end up with a non-simple purely inseparable closure. Maybe it's because the only example I know of a non-simple extension is the one mentioned at the beginning that I don't know how to create new examples. I spent a bit of time trying to prove that no such extension could exist, but could not make any progress there either. Any help is appreciated.

In particular, cannot be normal over (see Proposition V.6.11 in Lang's Algebra , page 251, third edition). Moreover, cannot be perfect because every algebraic extension of a perfect field is separable (see Corollary V.6.12 in Lang's Algebra , page 252, third edition), so in particular cannot be a finite field or have characteristic . Moreover, this answer by @KConrad on MathOverflow shows that every finite extension of is simple, so these are also ruled out as candidates for . I haven't been able to make any progress beyond this, though. I've tried fiddling around with the above standard example of , but no matter how I make non-simple I end up with a non-simple purely inseparable closure. Maybe it's because the only example I know of a non-simple extension is the one mentioned at the beginning that I don't know how to create new examples. I spent a bit of time trying to prove that no such extension could exist, but could not make any progress there either. Any help is appreciated. This question is inspired by the problem asked here: A finite extension is simple iff the purely inseparable closure is simple? . Any such example of extension fields would provide a counter-example to the claim in the title of the linked question.","k p > 0 k(x,y) k(x^p,y^p) K/F F K F K I \alpha \in K F F K S \alpha \in K F I S K F SI = K SI F K F F F 0 \Bbb{F}_p(x) F k(x,y)/k(x^p,y^p) K/F K/F","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

And $\textit{finally}$, show that the unipotent radical $$U_n = \Bigg\{ \begin{pmatrix} I_1 & B_{12} \ldots & B_{1r} \\                                  0 & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\                                 \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & B_{r-1r} \\                                   0     & \ldots & 0    & I_r \end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}$$ where $$I_i = Id_{GL_{n}}, \, 1\leq i \leq r, B_{ij}\in \text{Mat}(n_{i} \times n_{j}, K) \, 1\leq i < j \leq r $$ is a normal subgroup in $P_n$.

What I tried is to rewrite each vector $x \in K^n$ for all $V_i$ where $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ to $$ x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ x_n\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_{V_i} \\ x'_{V_i} \end{pmatrix}$$ where $$ x \in V_i \Leftrightarrow x'_{V_i} = 0$$ Put informally, I think I 'see' that if I left-multiply some vector $x \in V_i \subset F_n$ with some matrix $p \in P_n$, then I should still get some vector $x^* \in V_i \subset F_n$. But how to write that down in a correct way? Also, for illustration purposes I tried to left-multiply the vector $$ x = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with the given matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & B_{12} \ldots & B_{1r} \\                                  0 & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\                                 \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & B_{r-1r} \\                                   0     & \ldots & 0    & A_r \end{pmatrix}$$ in order to show that this really affects the resulting vector $x^*$ only in the first 3 coordinates, i.e. that it still lies in the subspace $V_i \in F_n$ it was before. But I got in some trouble regarding how to actually multiply it with the given block matrices. For example, $A_1$ would be in $GL_{n_1}(K)$, but how would I know what $n_1$ is? With regard to the third part, I know what a normal subgroup is and how to check it, i.e. $xVx^{-1} \subset V \, \forall x \in P_n$. I already did that with triangular matrices and the triangular matrices where $1$s are on the diagonal. However, here are entire matrices within other matrices, so I assume this complicates things. Hence, what's the idea?","For my abstract algebra class I have to do some exercises concerning group actions of $GL_n(K)$ on the set of flags $$F_n = \{0 \subseteq V_1 \subseteq V_2 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq V_r = K^n \,\vert\, \text{dim}_K V_i = n_1 + \ldots + n_i\}$$ where $n_1 + \ldots + n_r = n$. Although I got to know the basic things such as orbit and stabilizer, I don't have any practice on how to apply these concepts and, concretely, for these exercise I don't know how to proceed. The question is threefold and as follows. $\textit{First}$, show that the parabolic subgroup  $$P_n = \Bigg\{ \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & B_{12} \ldots & B_{1r} \\                                  0 & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\                                 \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & B_{r-1r} \\                                   0     & \ldots & 0    & A_r \end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}$$ where $$A_i \in GL_{n_i}, \, 1\leq i \leq r, B_{ij}\in \text{Mat}(n_{i} \times n_{j}, K) \, 1\leq i < j \leq r $$ is a subgroup of $GL_{n}$ by using the group action of $GL_n(K)$ on $F_n$. $\textit{Secondly}$, with the help of this result, show that the corresponding Levi subgroup $$M_n = \Bigg\{ \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & 0 \ldots & 0 \\                                  0 & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\                                 \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\                                   0     & \ldots & 0    & A_r \end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}$$ where $$A_i \in GL_{n_i}$$ is in turn a subgroup of $P_n$. And $\textit{finally}$, show that the unipotent radical $$U_n = \Bigg\{ \begin{pmatrix} I_1 & B_{12} \ldots & B_{1r} \\                                  0 & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\                                 \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & B_{r-1r} \\                                   0     & \ldots & 0    & I_r \end{pmatrix}\Bigg\}$$ where $$I_i = Id_{GL_{n}}, \, 1\leq i \leq r, B_{ij}\in \text{Mat}(n_{i} \times n_{j}, K) \, 1\leq i < j \leq r $$ is a normal subgroup in $P_n$. With that, also prove that $P_n/U_n \cong M_n$ What I know is that the stabilizer for a group G and a set M is the set $G_x = \{g \in G\vert g\cdot x = x\}$ with $x \in M$ and a subgroup of $G$. I would merely guess that in the first or second part I would have to show that along these lines. In short, I do not have a clear conceptual picture and, most of all, I wouldn't know how to write it down properly even in case I had it.

Equivalently, this is a monoid in the monoidal category $(\mathsf{Set}_*,\wedge)$. By a $\pm$-monoid I mean a pointed monoid $M$ together with a decomposition $M = M^+ \cup M^-$ such that $M^+ \cap M^- = \{0\}$, $1 \in M^+$ and $M^{\pm} \cdot M^{\pm} \subseteq M^+$, $M^{\pm} \cdot M^{\mp} \subseteq M^-$. You can imagine $M^+$ as the set of elements $\geq 0$ and $M^-$ as the set of elements $\leq 0$, even though $M$ doesn't have to be ordered in the usual sense. As a class of examples, take the multiplicative structure of an ordered (semi)ring, for example $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$. These have the $\pm$-submonoids $\{0,1\},\{0,-1\},\{0,1,-1\}$. The ""generic"" example in terms of representation theory is the following: Take any monoid $G$ and consider $E = E^+ \vee_{0} E^-$, where $EM^+$ is the set of endomorphisms of $G$ and $E^-$ is the set of anti-endomorphisms of $G$. Let $0$ be the trivial endomorphism, and $1$ be the identity. The multiplication in $M$ is the composition of functions. Then $E$ is a $\pm$-monoid, which may be called $\mathrm{End}^{\pm}(G)$. A module over a $\pm$-monoid $M$ is a monoid $G$ together with a morphism $M \to \mathrm{End}^{\pm}(G)$ of $\pm$-monoids. Question. Have these $\pm$-monoids and their modules already been studied in the literature? Or do they have another common name? What is known about them (classification, properties, etc)?","By a pointed monoid I mean a monoid $M$ together with an absorbing element $0 \in M$ (i.e. $0x=x0=0$). Equivalently, this is a monoid in the monoidal category $(\mathsf{Set}_*,\wedge)$. By a $\pm$-monoid I mean a pointed monoid $M$ together with a decomposition $M = M^+ \cup M^-$ such that $M^+ \cap M^- = \{0\}$, $1 \in M^+$ and $M^{\pm} \cdot M^{\pm} \subseteq M^+$, $M^{\pm} \cdot M^{\mp} \subseteq M^-$. You can imagine $M^+$ as the set of elements $\geq 0$ and $M^-$ as the set of elements $\leq 0$, even though $M$ doesn't have to be ordered in the usual sense. As a class of examples, take the multiplicative structure of an ordered (semi)ring, for example $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$. These have the $\pm$-submonoids $\{0,1\},\{0,-1\},\{0,1,-1\}$. The ""generic"" example in terms of representation theory is the following: Take any monoid $G$ and consider $E = E^+ \vee_{0} E^-$, where $EM^+$ is the set of endomorphisms of $G$ and $E^-$ is the set of anti-endomorphisms of $G$. Let $0$ be the trivial endomorphism, and $1$ be the identity. The multiplication in $M$ is the composition of functions. Then $E$ is a $\pm$-monoid, which may be called $\mathrm{End}^{\pm}(G)$.

63,Natural Euclidean Function Not Satisfying the $d$-inequality,Natural Euclidean Function Not Satisfying the -inequality,d,"Let me provide some background before I begin (although I feel as though it's hardly needed): Let $R$ be an integral domain. I call a function $d:R\setminus \{0\}\to\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$ a Euclidean function if for every $a,b\in R$ , $a\ne0$ , there exists $q,r\in R$ with $b=aq+r$ and    either $r=0$ or $d(r)<d(a)$ . I say that a Euclidean function satisfies the $d$ -inequality if $x\mid y$ implies $d(x)\leqslant d(y)$ . It is often assumed that Euclidean functions for example, in the context of Euclidean domains, always satisfy the $d$ -inequality since given a Euclidean function $d$ the function $\displaystyle \widetilde{d}(x)=\min_{y\ne 0}d(xy)$ is a Euclidean function satisfying the $d$ -inequality. Thus, Euclidean domains (i.e. rings for which there exists a Euclidean function on) are precisely the same as the rings that admit Euclidean functions satisfying the $d$ -inequality. Now, while, as I said above, the study of such rings (where the only key is the existence of such functions) is no different, practically it's much nicer to have Euclidean functions satisfying the $d$ -inequality since they enjoy such benefits as $a\in R^\times$ if and only if $d(a)=d(1)$ . The strange thing is, most naturally occurring Euclidean functions satisfy the $d$ -inequality (e.g. the degree function on $F[x]$ , field norms, etc.) And, for the life of me, I can't think of a non-contrived example of a Euclidean function that does not satisfy the $d$ -inequality. So, what are some? Moreover, there will undoubtedly be some trivial, common one that I've overlooked, then I would still love to hear more obscure ones that arise naturally in more advanced contexts.

Definitions: A pair $(G, +)$ where $G$ is a set and $+: G \times G \rightarrow G$ is called a commutative group if it has all of the following three characteristics: (associativity): $\forall x,y,z \in G: (x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$ (identity element): $\exists e \in G \forall x \in G: e + x = x = x +e$ (inverse elements): $\forall x \in G \exists x^{-1} \in G: x^{-1} + x = e = x + x^{-1}$ (commutativity): $\forall x,y \in G: x+y=y+x$. A triple $(\mathbb{K}, +, \cdot)$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is a set and $+: \mathbb{K} \times \mathbb{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ $\cdot: \mathbb{K} \times \mathbb{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{K}$ is called a field if it has all of the following three characteristics: $(\mathbb{K}, +)$ is a commutative group $(\mathbb{K} \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)$ is a commutative group distributive properties : $\forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{K}: x \cdot (y+z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)$ and $\forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{K}: (y+z) \cdot x = (y \cdot x) + (z \cdot x)$ $\mathbb{N^+} := 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...$ (all positive integers) $\mathbb{N}_0 := \{0\} \cup \mathbb{N}$ (the natural numbers with zero) $\mathbb{N}$ can be both: $\mathbb{N^+}$ or $\mathbb{N}_0$.

98,What is an extension field? Covered differently in math & in cryptography.,What is an extension field? Covered differently in math & in cryptography.,,"In his book on Cryptography, Paar has this theorem Theorem 4.3.1 A field with order m only exists if m is a prime power, i.e., m = p^n, for some positive integer n and prime integer p. p is called the characteristic of the finite field. So here he says that the order has to be a prime power - He also has this as examples This theorem implies that there are, for instance, finite fields with 11 elements, or with 81 elements (since 81 = 3^4) or with 256 elements (since 256 = 2^8, and 2 is a prime). So he explicitly says that you can have a field with 256 elements - the order of a finite field needs to be a prime power & not necessarily a prime itself. He then goes on to talk about extension fields - he says that if the order of the field is not a prime then it's called as an extension field. In AES the finite field contains 256 elements and is denoted as GF(2^8). This field was chosen because each of the field elements can be represented by one byte. For the S-Box and MixColumn transforms, AES treats every byte of the internal data path as an element of the field GF(2^8) and manipulates the data by performing arithmetic in this finite field. However, if the order of a finite field is not prime, and 2^8 is clearly not a prime, the addition and multiplication operation cannot be represented by addition and multiplication of integers modulo 2^8. Such fields with m > 1 are called extension fields. So as per this, I get the definition of an extension field as this - an extension field is any finite field where the order of the field is a prime power but not a prime itself. However, when I look at books on abstract algebra, I see a totally different definition of extension fields which seem to be unconnected with what Paar says. For e.g. from ""Topics in Algebra"" by Hernstein: Let F be a field; a field K is said to be an extension of F if K contains F. Equivalently, K is an extension of F if F is a subfield of K. So are Extension fields described in Cryptography different from those described in Algebra? But is Paar's description wrong? Or are the 2 definitions equivalent in some way?","In his book on Cryptography, Paar has this theorem Theorem 4.3.1 A field with order m only exists if m is a prime power, i.e., m = p^n, for some positive integer n and prime integer p. p is called the characteristic of the finite field. So here he says that the order has to be a prime power - He also has this as examples This theorem implies that there are, for instance, finite fields with 11 elements, or with 81 elements (since 81 = 3^4) or with 256 elements (since 256 = 2^8, and 2 is a prime). So he explicitly says that you can have a field with 256 elements - the order of a finite field needs to be a prime power & not necessarily a prime itself. He then goes on to talk about extension fields - he says that if the order of the field is not a prime then it's called as an extension field. In AES the finite field contains 256 elements and is denoted as GF(2^8). This field was chosen because each of the field elements can be represented by one byte. For the S-Box and MixColumn transforms, AES treats every byte of the internal data path as an element of the field GF(2^8) and manipulates the data by performing arithmetic in this finite field. However, if the order of a finite field is not prime, and 2^8 is clearly not a prime, the addition and multiplication operation cannot be represented by addition and multiplication of integers modulo 2^8. Such fields with m > 1 are called extension fields.
