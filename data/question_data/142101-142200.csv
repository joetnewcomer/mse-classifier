I have been asked to evaluate $$\lim_{n \to +\infty}\int_0^1 (n + 1)x^{n}(1 - x^3)^{1/5}\,dx.$$ I did this problem in a hurried manner, but here's what I think. Since $x^n$ is decreasing in $n$ for fixed $x$ in the closed unit interval, it seems like the integrand, which we may denote by $f_n$, converges pointwise to zero. If I can show that the integrand in fact converges uniformly to zero, by showing $$M_n = \sup_{x\in[0,1]}|f_n(x)|\rightarrow 0,$$ then the question is simply a matter of commuting the limit with the integral. Now, $f_n(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on $[0 , 1]$, so it achieves its supremum, which can be found by differentiating and finding the critical points. I found this critical point to be $x=(\frac{5n}{5n+3})^{1/3}$. The denominator exceeds the numerator in this expression for all $n$, so the critical point is between 0 and 1. It also seems clear to me that this is a local maximum. At this point, $f_n$ achieves the value $$M_n =  (n+1)(\frac{5n}{5n+3})^{n/3}(1 - \frac{5n}{5n+3})^{1/5}$$ which goes to infinity. So, my intuition failed me at some point. What is the proper solution to this limit?
