1,The rotation of dice on a grid,The rotation of dice on a grid,,"Imagine you have a plane, flat surface with a square grid drawn on it. You have a standard cubic die  which is placed flat on the surface. Its length is the same as the length of side of each grid square. The only way to move the die to an adjacent square is by tipping the die into the square. So obviously the die cannot move diagonally. Since this grid is infinitely large, there are infinite round trips that can be made with the die. Some of these round-trips can cause a rotation of the die. The set of all round trips can be categorized into equivalence sets, where each class represents a particular rotation following a round-trip. These rotations naturally constitute a group. Can anyone list out all possible rotations in this configuration? Also, when moving the die around, I noticed that it was impossible for a round-trip to produce a 90 degree rotation about the the axis perpendicular to the surface. Can anyone give me a simple proof of this? It seems to be an easy proof, but I am unable to show it. Also, if we generalize this to a n-sided die, what are the impossible rotations? If anyone could provide a related paper or reference as well, I would really appreciate it.","Imagine you have a plane, flat surface with a square grid drawn on it.

I don't understand how the first answer works and I have doubt about that answer. The second answer uses character theory which I don't intend to use since I am practicing for my qualifying exam. This problem showed up in our last exam. None of my classmates can solve this problem and the professors in our department just provided us with some hints saying look the homomorphism and do induction which helped a little but didn't lead me to an answer. Now I list the two approaches I have tried and the reasons why they don't work. The first approach I tried is the following: Suppose $G$ is finite abelian. Let $|G|=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$ and $|H|=p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2}\cdots p_k^{\beta_k}$ . By the elementary divisor decomposition, we have $G\cong G_1\times G_2\times\cdots\times G_k$ and $H\cong H_1\times H_2\times\cdots\times H_k$ where $G_i$ is a Sylow subgroup of $G$ and $H_i$ is a Sylow subgroup of $H$ for all $i=1,2,...,k$ . Hence $G/H\cong(G_1/H_1)\times(G_2/H_2)\times\cdots\times(G_k/H_k)$ . So it suffices to show the result when $G$ is a $p$ -group. Suppose $|G|=p^n$ . Now by the invariant factor decomposition, $G\cong\mathbb{Z}_{p^{a_1}}\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^{a_2}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^{a_t}}$ with $a_1\geq a_2\geq\cdots\geq a_t$ and $a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_t=n$ . For $i=1,...,t$ , let $e_i=(...,0,1,0,...)$ . Then $G/H=\left<e_1H,...,e_tH\right>$ . WLOG, let $\{e_1H,e_2H,...,e_sH\}$ , $s\leq t$ , be a smallest set of generators for $G/H$ . Claim: $G/H\cong\left<e_1H\right>\times\cdots\times\left<e_sH\right>$ . So $G/H\cong\mathbb{Z}_{p^{b_1}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^{b_s}}$ with $b_i\leq a_i$ for all $i=1,...,s$ . (This is due to the canonical projection $G\mapsto G/H$ and thus $|e_iH|\mid |e_i|$ for all $i=1,...,s$ .) Therefore, $G/H$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$ . This looks promising, but the claim is false. A counterexample is this: Let $G=\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_4$ . Then $G/\left<(2,2)\right>\cong\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ , but $(0,1)+\left<(2,2)\right>$ and $(1,0)+\left<(2,2)\right>$ both have order 4. The second aprroach I tried is the following: Suppose $G$ is finite abelian and $H\leq G$ . Let $|G|=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_k^{\alpha_k}$ and $|H|=p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2}\cdots p_k^{\beta_k}$ where $p_1,...,p_k$ are distinct primes. By the elementary divisor decomposition, we have $G\cong G_1\times G_2\times\cdots\times G_k$ and $H\cong H_1\times H_2\times\cdots\times H_k$ where $G_i$ is a Sylow $p_i$ -subgroup of $G$ and $H_i$ is a Sylow $p_i$ -subgroup of $H$ for all $i=1,2,...,k$ . Since $H_i\unlhd G_i$ for all $i=1,...,k$ , $G/H\cong(G_1/H_1)\times(G_2/H_2)\times\cdots\times(G_k/H_k)$ . So it suffices to show the result when $G$ is an abelian $p$ -group. We proceed by induction. If $|G|=p$ , then $H=1$ or $G$ , so $G/H\cong1$ or $G$ . Suppose the result holds for all abelian $p$ -groups of order less than $|G|$ . Now by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, $G=\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_1}}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^{\alpha_n}}=\left<x_1\right>\times\cdots\times\left<x_n\right>$ . Consider $\varphi:G\to G$ such that $x\mapsto x^p$ . Since $G$ is abelian, $\varphi$ is a group homomorphism with $\ker\varphi=\left<x_1^{p^{\alpha_1-1}}\right>\times\cdots\left<x_n^{p^{\alpha_n-1}}\right>$ . By Cauchy's theorem, $H':=\ker\varphi\cap H\neq1$ and it is elementary abelian. So WLOG, $H'\cong\left<x_1^{p^{\alpha_1-1}}\right>\times\cdots\left<x_m^{p^{\alpha_m-1}}\right>$ where $m\leq n$ . It follows that $G/H'$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$ . By the third isomorphism theorem, we have $G/H\cong(G/H')/(H/H')$ . Since $|G/H'|<|G|$ , by the induction hypothesis, $(G/H')/(H/H')$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G/H'$ and thus it is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$ . Therefore, $G/H$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $G$ . Now in this proof I assume that if $B$ and $C$ are isomorphic subgroups of a finite abelian group $A$ , then $A/B\cong A/C$ which is not true. A counterexample is $A=\mathbb{Z}_4\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ , $B=\left<(2,0)\right>$ and $C=\left<(0,1)\right>$ . Here $A/B\cong\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\not\cong\mathbb{Z}_4\cong A/C$ .

None of my classmates can solve this problem and the professors in our department just provided us with some hints saying look the homomorphism and do induction which helped a little but didn't lead me to an answer. Now I list the two approaches I have tried and the reasons why they don't work. The first approach I tried is the following: Suppose is finite abelian. Let and . By the elementary divisor decomposition, we have and where is a Sylow subgroup of and is a Sylow subgroup of for all . Hence . So it suffices to show the result when is a -group. Suppose . Now by the invariant factor decomposition, with and . For , let . Then . WLOG, let , , be a smallest set of generators for . Claim: . So with for all . (This is due to the canonical projection and thus for all .) Therefore, is isomorphic to a subgroup of . This looks promising, but the claim is false. A counterexample is this: Let . Then , but and both have order 4. The second aprroach I tried is the following: Suppose is finite abelian and . Let and where are distinct primes. By the elementary divisor decomposition, we have and where is a Sylow -subgroup of and is a Sylow -subgroup of for all . Since for all , . So it suffices to show the result when is an abelian -group. We proceed by induction. If , then or , so or . Suppose the result holds for all abelian -groups of order less than . Now by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, . Consider such that . Since is abelian, is a group homomorphism with . By Cauchy's theorem, and it is elementary abelian. So WLOG, where . It follows that is isomorphic to a subgroup of . By the third isomorphism theorem, we have . Since , by the induction hypothesis, is isomorphic to a subgroup of and thus it is isomorphic to a subgroup of . Therefore, is isomorphic to a subgroup of . Now in this proof I assume that if and are isomorphic subgroups of a finite abelian group , then which is not true. A counterexample is , and . Here . Now my question is does anyone know how to fix either of the problems in my two attempts above to make it work? Or have a better explanation for the first answer in the post Is every quotient of a finite abelian group $G$ isomorphic to some subgroup of $G$? ? This problem have haunted me for months.

If the proof is incorrect, please limit answers to pointing out the errors. If the proof is correct, then thoughts on improving it would be appreciated. Prove that $\Bbb Q$ is not the direct product of two non-trivial groups. —Aluffi exercise II.3.5. My proof Suppose that $\Bbb Q = G \times H$ , neither $G$ nor $H$ trivial. First note that $0_G$ is the only element of $G$ with finite order: If $m\ne 0$ and $m\cdot g=0_G$ , then $m\cdot(g,0_H)=0_{G\times H}$ , contradicting the fact that $\Bbb Q$ has no non-zero elements of finite order. Suppose that for some $m\ne 0$ and some $n\ne 0$ , $\pi_G(m/n)=0_G$ . Then $0_G=n\cdot\pi_G\left(\frac m n\right)=\pi_G\left(n\cdot\frac m n\right)=\pi_G(m)=m\cdot\pi_G(1)$ . Since $\pi_G(1)$ has finite order, we conclude that $\pi_G(1)=0$ . Since $\Bbb Z=\langle 1\rangle$ , $\pi_G$ maps every integer to $0_G$ . Now let $a$ and $b$ be non-zero integers. Then $b\cdot\pi_G\left(\frac a b\right)=\pi_G\left(b\cdot \frac a b\right)=\pi_G(a)=0_G$ . As above, this shows that $\pi_G\left(\frac a b\right)=0_G$ . Thus if $\pi_G$ is not an injective function, then it must map everything to $0_G$ , so $G$ will be a trivial group. The same result holds for $\pi_H$ . Since by assumption, $G$ and $H$ are non-trivial, $\pi_G$ and $\pi_H$ are both injective functions, which is of course impossible.","I know this has been asked before, in a bunch of places, so I expect it to be closed as a duplicate at some point, but I'd like to know if my own proof works.

I'm currently writing a project on the braid groups and their analogues on closed surfaces. It's an easy exercise to show that if $B_n$ is Artin's classical braid group on $n$ strings, then $B_n$ can be embedded in $B_{n+1}$ (the homomorphism is given by 'adding a string' on to the end of any braid in $B_n$ and this can be shown to be a monomorphism). A similar statement can be proved for the pure braid group $P_n$. Let $P\mathcal{S}_n$ be the pure $n$-string braid group on the sphere $S^2$. Fox's definition of this group is the fundamental group of the configuration space $F_{n}S^2=\prod_n S^2\setminus\{(x_1,\ldots,x_n)|\exists i\neq j, x_i=x_j\}$ with basepoint $\hat{x}=(\hat{x}_1,\ldots,\hat{x}_n)$. The full braid group $\mathcal{S}_n$ is then the fundamental group of the configuration space $B_nS^2=F_nS^2/\sim$ where $x \sim y$ if the coordinates of $y$ are a permutation of the coordinates of $x$. It follows that $\mathcal{S}_n/P\mathcal{S}_n=\Sigma_n$ where $\Sigma_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ elements. It's well known that for $n\geq 3$, $P\mathcal{S}_n$ (and so $\mathcal{S}_n$) has torsion elements (given by the solution to the Dirac string problem for instance). With that framework now built up, my question is, can $\mathcal{S}_n$ be embedded in to $\mathcal{S}_{n+1}$ for $n\geq 3$ (and similarly for their pure counter parts)? The naive 'add a string on the end' map will not work because, for instance, the following trivial braid $\gamma$ here (see image below) becomes non-trivial when a string is added on the end, and so any such map would not respect the equivalence class of isotopic braids. I would think that the answer is no, but a proof eludes me. I've not been able to find any answer in the extensive literature which leads me to believe that the question is difficult.

What I note was that subtracting the function by a constant, changing the sign in one entry, and permuting the entries preserve the isometric property. So we can assume $f(0,\ldots,0)=(0,\ldots,0)$. For any vector $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, $\|f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)-(0,\ldots,0)\|=\|(a_1,\ldots,a_n)-(0,\ldots,0)\|$, so $\|f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\|=\max|a_i|$.

This confuses me; there seems to be a type error. An element of $\operatorname{Aut} G$ is a function $\phi: G \rightarrow G$.

The only finite index subgroups I can think of take are of the form Gal(F/K) where K is a finite extension of Q , but of course these are by definition all closed. So I guess I've stuffed up somewhere, and I'd be really grateful for any help?!

I began by counting the number of elements of each cycle type in S5 so that I could deduce the conjugacy classes and class equation for S5. Next I checked centralizers to determine which were conjugacy classes in A5 and I got the class equation for $A_5$ as $60 = 1 + 12 + 12 + 15 + 20$. Using the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we can deduce from the order of the last conjugacy class that there is a subgroup of order $3$, namely the centralizer of any element in this conjugacy class, for example $C((12345))={e, (12345), (15432)}$. It is easy to then find a subgroup of order $2$ such as $<(12)(34)>= {e, (12)(34)}$. Since the intersection of these two groups is ${e}$, my hope was that $<(12)(34)>(12345)$ would be a subgroup of order $6$, unfortunately not all the elements commute (If the elements of two subgroups $H$,$K$ commute and their intersection is ${e}$ then $HK$ is a subgroup with order equal to the product of the orders) so I'm left at a dead end.","I am trying to figure out if $A_5$ has a subgroup of order $6$.

86,Center of the categories $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$.,Center of the categories  and .,\mathbf{Grp} \mathbf{Ab},"This is Exercise II.5.8 from Mac Lane, Categories for the Working Mathematician . For the identity functor $I_C$ of any category, the natural transformations $\alpha:I_C\dot{\to}I_C$ form a commutative monoid. Find this monoid in the cases $C=\mathbf{Grp}$, $\mathbf{Ab}$ and $\mathbf{Set}$. I found out that this monoid is called the center of the category $C$, and I'm going to call is $Z(C)$. My  problem was to find a nice characterization of the centers of $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$. Here's my work so far: Notice that $\alpha:I_C\dot{\to} I_C$ is natural iff $\alpha_c$ commutes with every arrows $f:c\to c$ for every $c$ (in other words, iff $\alpha_c$ is in the center of the monoid $\hom_C(c,c)$). In symbols: $$Z(C)=\left\{\alpha:I_C\dot{\to}I_C \mid \forall c\in C, \forall f\in\hom_C(c,c), \alpha_c f=f\alpha_c\right\}\qquad (*)$$ This implies directly that the center of $\mathbf{Set}$ is trivial (that is, it contains only the unit natural transformation). However, this will not work in $\mathbf{Grp}$ and $\mathbf{Ab}$, since the monoid of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative. However, not every two endomorphisms of arbitrary groups commute: Let $G=F_2$, the free group with two generators $a$ and $b$.

That said, the best description of $Z(C)$, for $C=\mathbf{Grp}$ or $\mathbf{Ab}$, I can give at the moment is ($*$) as above.

Let me give you a quick overview: If $\mu:G\times G\to G$ denotes the multiplication morphism and $\Bbbk[G]=\Bbbk[f_1,\ldots,f_n]$ then we may assume that the $f_i$ span a $G$-invariant subspace $V\subseteq\Bbbk[G]$. One can show that the comorphism $\mu^\sharp:\Bbbk[G]\to\Bbbk[G]\otimes\Bbbk[G]$ maps $V$ into $\Bbbk[G]\otimes V$ and thus, $$ \mu^\sharp(f_i) = \sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes f_j $$ for certain $\psi_{ij}\in\Bbbk[G]$. One then maps $g$ to the matrix $\Psi_g$ with entries $\psi_{ij}(g)$. Now my question is: Why is this a homomorphism of groups? I can tell you what I have done so far. One may consider the triple multiplication morphism $\nu:G\times G\times G\to G$ which is just $\nu:=\mu\circ(\mathrm{id}\times\mu)$, so we get $$\begin{align*} \nu^\sharp(f_i) &= (\mathrm{id}\times\mu)^\sharp\left(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes f_j\right) =  \sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \mu^\sharp(f_j) \\ &= \sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \sum_{k=1}^n \psi_{jk} \otimes f_k = \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \psi_{jk}\right) \otimes  f_k  \end{align*}$$ so $f_i(abc) =  \sum_{k=1}^n (\Psi_a\Psi_b)_{ik} \cdot f_k(c)$.

Observe that $\sigma_i^2 = \mathrm{Id}\implies \phi(\sigma_i)^2=\mathrm{Id}$ and that $\phi(\sigma_i)^5 = \mathrm{Id}$, since the target group is $C_5$. Therefore, the order of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ must be 1 for all $i$. Hence there is only one homomorphism, namely $\phi\equiv \mathrm{Id}$.",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'permutations']"
95,Proving that the free group on two generators is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$,Proving that the free group on two generators is the coproduct  in,\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z} \textbf{Grp},"I want to show that the free group on two elements $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$. The idea is to use the universal property of free groups to prove that $F(\{x,y\})$ satisfies the universal property of coproducts in  $\textbf{Grp}$. Below is my attempt to prove this. Is this correct? and also I am having trouble extending this result to the free group on $n$ elements. Any help/comments will be appreciated. Thanks Let $G$ be any group. Define $\gamma:\{x,y\}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ to be the set map which send $x$ to the generator $1$ and $y$ to the identity. For the means of set up, let $J:\{x,y\}\rightarrow F(\{x,y\})$ be the set map native to the free group. Next denote $\iota:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow F(\{x,y\})$ to be the inclusion map, which sends $1$ to the generator $x$. Now consider what we've established thus far Now suppose that we have a group homomorphism $f:\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow G$, then $f\circ \gamma$ is a set map from $\{x,y\}$ and thus by the universal property of free groups there exists a unique group homomorphism $\phi:F(\{x,y\})\rightarrow G$ such that commutes. Now to show that $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$, we must show that $f=\phi\circ\iota$, that is the following diagram commutes I claim that indeed it does. From the commutativity of the second diagram, we have that $f\circ\gamma=\phi\circ j$. It follows that  $$f\circ\gamma(x)=f(1)=\phi(x)=\phi\circ j(x) \text{ and } f\circ\phi(y)=f(0)=\phi(y)=\phi\circ j(y)=e_G $$ Notice that $\phi\circ\iota(1)=\phi(x)=f(1)$, which shows that the homomorphism $\phi\circ\iota$ and $f$ agree for the generator of $\mathbb{Z}$ and so $\phi\circ\iota=f$  The commutativity of the third diagram is confirmed, proving that $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ (we already have existence $\phi$ from the universal property of free groups, but not the uniqueness in this scenario?).","I want to show that the free group on two elements $F(\{x,y\})$ is the coproduct $\mathbb{Z}*\mathbb{Z}$ in $\textbf{Grp}$.
