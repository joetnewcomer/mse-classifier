2,Prove $f$ entire and with a pole at infinity to be polynomial,Prove  entire and with a pole at infinity to be polynomial,f,"The question has been asked before, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it.

15,Show bounded harmonic function on $\mathbb{C}$ is constant.,Show bounded harmonic function on  is constant.,\mathbb{C},"There is another post with this exact same prompt which got several down-votes for not showing  their work.  So I'll show what work I've got.  I know being a harmonic function implies satisfying the Mean Value Property, thus what I thought I'd do is consider two arbitrary points in $\mathbb{C}$ and prove that: $$|u(z) - u(w)|=|\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}u(z - re^{i\theta})d\theta - \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}u(w - te^{i\theta})d\theta| $$ $$= |\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}u(z - re^{i\theta}) - u(w - te^{i\theta})d\theta|$$ Now what I wan't to do is take r and t to infinity and prove this integral goes to zero, but I can't figure out how to do that.  I've used the fact that my harmonic function u is defined on all of $\mathbb{C}$ in taking t and r to infinity but I still need to use the fact that it's bounded. I also read through the proof of Liouville's Theorem, given as an answer in that other post, which seems intuitively correct but rather un-rigorous.  It actually says that the value in the center of a ball is equal to the average over the ball's volume.  I imagine this can be proven from the average over the boundary since the average over the boundary will not change as you continuously shrink the boundary down to its center. This however would require the difference of two surface integrals, or is there a simpler way? I was also considering using the Maximum Modulus Principle somehow but I haven't found a way yet.  I've probably made this way more complicated than it has to be, hopefully someone can help me, thanks! =]. Edit: Ok after thinking some more about the accepted answer in that other post, I've decided what I need to do is look at the canonical holomorphic function whose real part is my harmonic function u, and prove that holomorphic function is bounded.  From there I can prove that since it's entire and bounded that it's constant, and from there prove that then its real part must be constant.

16,How did Gauss sum Eisenstein series?,How did Gauss sum Eisenstein series?,,"Entry 61 in Gauss's diary states (this is a translation from latin): From the integer powers of $$\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^4}}$$ depends $$\sum_{m,n}(\frac{m^4 - 6m^2n^2 +n^4}{(m^2+n^2)^4})^k$$ . The expression inside the summation is: $\frac{m^4 - 6m^2n^2 +n^4}{(m^2+n^2)^4} = \frac{1}{(m+n\sqrt{-1})^4}+\frac{1}{(m-n\sqrt{-1})^4} $ , so this entry apparently connects Eisenstein series with integral powers of half the ""lemniscate constant"" $\varpi = 2\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^4}}$ . Note also of the analogy with ""Basel problem""; here the summation of the fourth powers of inverse ""Gaussian integers"" rationally depends on the fourth power not of $\pi = 2\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$ but rather on the fourth power of its lemniscatic analogue. Felix klein and Ludwig Schlesinger, the mathematicians who commented on this diary entry, interpreted Gauss's entry as the statement that the sum of Eisenstein series of weight $4k$ is a rational number times $\varpi^{4k}$ . I also found additional verification of the conjecture that Gauss apparently summed up Eisenstein series in several other sources (mentioned below). Schlesinger and Klein offer a reconstruction of the way Gauss arrived at the statement in entry 61 in p. 516 of volume 10.1 of his works. They say he began with the infinite product expansion of $\mathbb{sinlemn}(z) = \frac{M(z)}{N(z)}$ , and then arrived somehow at an infinite series for the logarithm of the numerator $M(z)$ and the denominator $N(z)$ . The numerator $M(z)$ has zeros at Gaussian integers multiples of $\varpi$ (that is: $M((m+ni)\varpi) = 0$ , where $m,n$ are integers), while $N(z)$ has zeros at Gaussian half-integers multiples of $\varpi$ , and therefore: $$M(z) = z\cdot \prod_{(m,n)\ne (0,0)}(1-\frac{z}{(m+ni)\varpi})$$ $$N(z) = \prod (1-\frac{z}{((m+\frac{1}{2})+(n+\frac{1}{2})i)\varpi})$$ Since the logarithm of an infinite product equals an infinite sum of logarithms, one gets: $$(*)\mathbb{log}M(z) = \mathbb{log}(z)+\sum_{(m,n)\ne (0,0)}\mathbb{log}(1-\frac{z}{(m+ni)\varpi})$$ $$(**)\mathbb{log}N(z) = \sum \mathbb{log}(1-\frac{z}{((m+\frac{1}{2})+(n+\frac{1}{2})i)\varpi})$$ . In addition, on p.159 of volume 10.1 in Gauss's werke, Gauss somehow gives the following infinite series: $$(***)\mathbb{log}M(z) = \mathbb{log}(z) - \frac{1}{60}z^4 - \frac{1}{4200}z^8 -\frac{1}{321750}z^{12} - ...$$ $$(****)\mathbb{log}N(z) =\frac{1}{12}z^4 - \frac{1}{280}z^8 +\frac{1}{4950}z^{12} - ...$$ . Comparing the coefficients of the series for $\mathbb{log}M(z)$ with the coefficients that result from (*) apparently enabled Gauss to sum particular cases of Eisenstein series, and to come up with the statement in his diary entry. Now, I have two misunderstandings concerning this conjecture: The sum $$\sum_{m,n} (\frac{1}{(m+n\sqrt{-1})^4}+\frac{1}{(m-n\sqrt{-1})^4})^k $$ is not exactly   the canonical form of an Eisenstein series because of the second fraction inside the basis of the $k$ power. Therefore, how to show the equivalence of the two sums? I don't understand how the evaluation of the logarithm of the numerator $\mathbb{log}M(z)$ amounts to summation of Eisenstein series. I simply need to see the algebra written more clearly. So can someone explain to me how this reasoning amounts to summing Eisenstein series? Update (13 February, 2022) An additional point of interest that I noted now is that Gauss's series for $\mathbb{log}N(z)$ corresponds to a kind of ""generalized Eisenstein series"" in which the lattice is shifted by $(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}i)\varpi$ . Since  such shifted lattice cannot be generated by some action of the modular group on the lattice of Gaussian integers (if it was, one could use the modularity of the Eisenstein series and deduce the series for $\mathbb{log}N(z)$ from that of $\mathbb{log}M(z)$ ), I wondered what tools enable to sum such series and what was Gauss's original method in this case.

To place this question let me define with what I mean with 3 dimensions in the following. When we first explore the complex numbers we start by looking at roots of negative numbers where we define (in order to solve equations with negative roots):$$i=\sqrt{-1}.$$ Using this imaginary unit we can define a complex number as $$z=a+ib,\text{ with } z_1z_2=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2)+i(a_1b_2+a_2b_1),$$ or written as a 2-tupel:$$z=(a,b),\text{ with } z_1z_2=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2,a_1b_2+a_2b_1).$$The complex number has one real variable and one imaginary variable, so it can be represented as in a 2-dimensional plane.

Now I was wondering if there might exist some kind of complex number with only 2 imaginary units $i$ and $j$ which might be represented as a number in the 3 dimensional plane ?  If i look at the way the quaternions are constructed I think the answer is maybe, the reasoning I have for this is that given 2 imaginary numbers $i$ and $j$ we could construct it analogous and state that $$i^2=j^2=-1,$$ but what to do with the product $ij$? The product should square to one so it should be minus one or one:$$ij=-1\quad\text{ or }\quad ij=1.$$If it squared to minus 1 it would be a new complex number, and then we would get that one of the numbers $i$ or $j$ is redundant (unless we itroduce a third one of course), so we continue with the demand that the second relation holds.

33,What is the Galois group of sinus?,What is the Galois group of sinus?,,"I am trying to define the Galois group of complex functions. For example for sinus we have the product representation: $$\sin(x) = x \prod_{k=1}^\infty \left( 1-\frac{x^2}{k^2\pi^2} \right)$$ The roots of $\sin$ are $0,\pm k \pi$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$. It is known that $\pi$ is transcendent, hence the field $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ is isomorphic as fields to $\mathbb{Q}(x)$. If we define $\sigma(\pi)=-\pi$ and extend it to a $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)/\mathbb{Q}$ automorphism, then the Galois Group of $\sin$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ should be $C_2$ the cyclic group. 1) Any suggestions how to define a Galois group of a complex function as a group of permutations of the roots of these functions? 2) Do you know of any other function where the ""Galois group"" as defined below gives a non trivial group other than $C_2$? For instance: What is the group defined below, for the Ramanujan theta function at $b=1$ ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_product#Product_representations_of_functions ) : $$f(a,1) = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1+a^{n+1})(1+a^n)(1-a^{n+1})$$ It seems that it has something to do with roots of unity. Preliminary definition: Let $\Lambda := \{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f(z) = 0 \}$. Let $\mathbb{Q}(\Lambda)$ be the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ which contains $\Lambda$. Define the Galois group of $f$ to be $$ Gal(f/\mathbb{Q}) := \{ \sigma \in Aut(\mathbb{Q}(\Lambda)/\mathbb{Q})| z \in \Lambda \rightarrow \sigma(z) \in \Lambda \text{ and } \sigma^{-1}(z) \in \Lambda\}$$ Notice that for polynomials, the last property is automatically fullfilled, as automorphisms commute with the polynomial in the following sense: $ \sigma(p(z)) = p(\sigma(z))$. The above example for $\sin$ shows that $C_2$ is a subgroup of the Galois group. Is it possible to prove given the above definition that $C_2$ equals the Galois group? Edit : By the comments below, we should only consider the automorphisms of the field extension which leave $\mathbb{Q}$ unchanged and permute the roots of the function. In the example above we have for any root $ z = k\pi, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ that: $$ 0 = \sigma(0) = \sigma(\sin(z)) = \sin(z) = \sin(-z) = \sin(\sigma(z))$$  Hence $\sigma$ maps roots to roots and is an automorphism of $\mathbb{Q(\pi)}$ which leaves $\mathbb{Q}$ unchanged. I don't think one needs the continuity here. Or did I miss something? I think in general ( for $z \in \mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ ) we do not have $\sigma(\sin(z)) = \sin(\sigma(z))$, so @Micah is right with his argument. Don't know if this still gives something interesting or not. Anyway, it is not clear how $\sigma(\sin(z))$ should be defined, as it might be the case that $\sin(z)$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ although $z$ is. (For example $\sin(\pi/4) = 1/\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$, so in general it does not make sense to define $\sigma$ on such elements.)","I am trying to define the Galois group of complex functions.

For instance: What is the group defined below, for the Ramanujan theta function at $b=1$ ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_product#Product_representations_of_functions ) : $$f(a,1) = \prod_{n=0}^\infty (1+a^{n+1})(1+a^n)(1-a^{n+1})$$ It seems that it has something to do with roots of unity. Preliminary definition: Let $\Lambda := \{ z \in \mathbb{C} | f(z) = 0 \}$. Let $\mathbb{Q}(\Lambda)$ be the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ which contains $\Lambda$. Define the Galois group of $f$ to be $$ Gal(f/\mathbb{Q}) := \{ \sigma \in Aut(\mathbb{Q}(\Lambda)/\mathbb{Q})| z \in \Lambda \rightarrow \sigma(z) \in \Lambda \text{ and } \sigma^{-1}(z) \in \Lambda\}$$ Notice that for polynomials, the last property is automatically fullfilled, as automorphisms commute with the polynomial in the following sense: $ \sigma(p(z)) = p(\sigma(z))$. The above example for $\sin$ shows that $C_2$ is a subgroup of the Galois group. Is it possible to prove given the above definition that $C_2$ equals the Galois group? Edit : By the comments below, we should only consider the automorphisms of the field extension which leave $\mathbb{Q}$ unchanged and permute the roots of the function. In the example above we have for any root $ z = k\pi, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ that: $$ 0 = \sigma(0) = \sigma(\sin(z)) = \sin(z) = \sin(-z) = \sin(\sigma(z))$$  Hence $\sigma$ maps roots to roots and is an automorphism of $\mathbb{Q(\pi)}$ which leaves $\mathbb{Q}$ unchanged. I don't think one needs the continuity here. Or did I miss something? I think in general ( for $z \in \mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ ) we do not have $\sigma(\sin(z)) = \sin(\sigma(z))$, so @Micah is right with his argument. Don't know if this still gives something interesting or not. Anyway, it is not clear how $\sigma(\sin(z))$ should be defined, as it might be the case that $\sin(z)$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$ although $z$ is. (For example $\sin(\pi/4) = 1/\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Q}(\pi)$, so in general it does not make sense to define $\sigma$ on such elements.)",,['complex-analysis']

Specifically, $$ {\overline r}=\frac{2a}{\pi}~\text{K}(-A)\\ s=b~\text{E}(-A)\\ A=\frac{a^2-b^2}{b^2} $$ where $a,b$ are the semi-major and -minor axes. We wondered if the there is a curve whose arc length is given by the elliptic integral of the first kind.

This is a single-parameter family of sigmoidal curves for $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ that can form closed curves when continued into the remaining quadrants. The arc length of the sigmoidal curve is $s=2\text{K}(-a^2)$. This result has been verified numerically, as well. Some example closed curves are shown below. The top figure shows random solutions for $a<\sqrt{2}$ and $a>\sqrt{2}$ on the left and right respectively. Those on the left overlap, those on the right do not. The lower figure demonstrates that these curves tessellate. So finally, the outstanding questions are: (1) The solution for $z$ seems to be intractable; it is important to simplify it if we are to have any chance of finding the area under the curve or its centroid. These will allow us to get at the bodies of revolution, as well. The problem is here is that these depend on the product $z^*\dot z$. The centroid of the curve itself is probably at its center point due to its symmetry. (2) A proper formula for extending the equation all the way around to a closed form is needed, in much the same way as the following equation describes a complete ellipse. $$z=a\cos\theta~\text{sign}(\cos\theta)+b\sin\theta~\text{sign}(\sin\theta),\quad \theta\in[0,2\pi]$$ (3) The significance of $a=\sqrt{2}$, which, by the way, is empirical, and may only be approximate.

I've made some progress so far, but I still have a step missing. Here is where I'm at: Suppose $f$ has finitely many zeros, namely $z=a_1,\,...\,,a_n \neq 0$ and possibly $z=0$ . Since $e^z$ and $P(z)$ are entire functions with orders of growth $1$ and $0$ respectively, then $f$ has order of growth $1$ .

If $m+n\geq 1$ , $R$ has at least one root, while $e^{z}$ has none (absurd), so $m+n=0\Rightarrow m=n=0\Rightarrow f$ has no zeros. Conclusion: either $f$ has infinitely many zeros or none at all.

97,Understanding branch cuts for functions with multiple branch points,Understanding branch cuts for functions with multiple branch points,,"My question was poorly worded and thus confusing. I'm going to edit it to make it clearer, and then I'm going to give a brief answer. Take, for example, the function $$f(z) = \sqrt{1-z^{2}}= \sqrt{(1+z)(1-z)} = \sqrt{|1+z|e^{i \arg(1+z)} |1-z|e^{i \arg(1-z)}}.$$ If we restrict $\arg(1+z)$ to $-\pi < \arg(1+z) \le \pi$, then the half-line $[-\infty,-1]$ needs to be omitted. But if we restrict $\arg(1-z)$ to $0 < \arg(1-z) \le 2 \pi$, why does the half-line $(-\infty, 1]$ need to be omitted and not the half-line $[1, \infty)$? And if we define $f(z)$ in such a way, how do we show that $f(z)$ is continuous across $(-\infty,-1)$? $ $ The answer to the first question is $(1-z)$ is real and positive for $z \in (-\infty,1)$. And with regard to the second question, to the left of $z=x=-1$ and just above the real axis, $$f(x) = \sqrt{(-1-x)e^{i (\pi)} (1-x)e^{i (2 \pi)}} = e^{3 \pi i /2} \sqrt{x^{2}-1} = -i \sqrt{x^{2}-1} .$$ While to the left of $z=x=-1$ and just below the real axis, $$f(x) = \sqrt{(-1-x)e^{i (-\pi)} (1-x)e^{i (0)}} = e^{-i \pi /2} \sqrt{x^{2}-1} = -i \sqrt{x^{2}-1} .$$","My question was poorly worded and thus confusing.

98,Can any harmonic function on $\{z:0<|z|<1\}$ be extended to $z=0$? [duplicate],Can any harmonic function on  be extended to ? [duplicate],\{z:0<|z|<1\} z=0,"This question already has an answer here : If $u$ is harmonic and bounded in $0 < |z| < \rho$, show that the origin is a removable singularity (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago . After looking at this question for quite some time, I've asked a couple of other students, and they also couldn't seem to come up with an answer.  This is from an old qualifying exam at our university. Let $u$ be a harmonic function bounded on the set $\{z:0 < |z| < 1\}$.  Can it always be defined at the point $ z= 0$ to become harmonic on the whole unit disk? The standard argument with the logarithm doesn't work here, as it must be bounded on the punctured disk, and the logarithm blows up at $0$.   Also, we can't use any kind of harmonic conjugate argument because our domain is not simply connected.  Thus, I think it's probably true, but I haven't been able to come up with a proof. Thanks in advance for any help!","This question already has an answer here : If $u$ is harmonic and bounded in $0 < |z| < \rho$, show that the origin is a removable singularity (1 answer) Closed 9 years ago .
