Since $M$ is constant, I know that the geodesic curve $\gamma:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^2$ is a straight line. Thus,  $$\dfrac{d\gamma}{ds}\equiv C,$$ where $C$ is a constant real value.

Then $M^{a}$ is diffeomorphic to $M^{b}$, where $M^{a}=f^{-1}(-\infty,a]$ ed $M^{b}=f^{-1}(-\infty,b]$ Now I'll write the proof I found in the book: Choose a Riemannian metric M; and let $<X,Y>$ denote the inner product of two tangent vectors, as determined by this metric. The gradient of f is the vector field $grad f$ on M which is characterized by the identity $<X,grad f>=X(f)$ for any vector field X.

This question is similar to my previous question concerning a circular room, but I want to focus on the harder part of regular polygons. This is like a single point inside of a regular polygon, say a triangle, being the endpoint of a ray.  The ray goes away from the point in a random direction and reflects off the sides of the triangle (staying inside the triangle).  Will it ever return to its original point?  If so, will it return infinitely or definitely?  Will it return to the original point in the original direction? When looking at my previous question, the answers were seemingly simple only because it was a circle.  However, I imagine a regular polygon scenario is much harder, but still possible to solve.","Suppose we have the following scenario: You are standing in a room that is in the shape of a regular n sided polygon with mirrors for walls.  You shine a light, a single ray of light, in a random direction.  Will the light ever return to its original position (the single point where the light originated from)?

89,How can a blind pixelated 2d mason chip away the entirety of a pixelated 2d rock,How can a blind pixelated 2d mason chip away the entirety of a pixelated 2d rock,,"So the mason is a single pixel and next to him there is a continuous pixelated rock in this 2d pixel space.

However, if he does this, there is a chance he could get lost (say if the rock is thin somewhere), or he could pitch or part of the rock and be left with more rocks, which would make this harder.

90,"The projective special linear group $PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ acts equivalent on $\mathbb F^2$ and $\mathbb F_{\infty} = \mathbb F \cup \{\infty\}$",The projective special linear group  acts equivalent on  and,"PSL(2,\mathbb F) \mathbb F^2 \mathbb F_{\infty} = \mathbb F \cup \{\infty\}","This question is closely related to this one. Again consider the group $G := PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ over some field $\mathbb F$. Then as written in the other post, there are two natural actions associated with $G$, one is by considering the points $\mathbb F^2$ and look at the induced action of $SL(2,\mathbb F)$ (as $PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ is just a quotient of $SL(2, \mathbb F)$), another by viewing $G$ as consisting of ""Möbius""-like maps of the form $$  x \mapsto \frac{ax + bc}{cx + d} $$ where $ad - bc = 1$ (remark: you get the same set of mappings by just asserting that $ad - bc$ must be a square) and let them act on $\mathbb F_{\infty} = \mathbb F \cup \{\infty\}$ (the extended field, or the projective line). Now I want to show that both actions are equivalent, i.e. we have essentially the same actions by identifiying the points $\mathbb F^2$ with the projective line $\mathbb F_{\infty}$. I started to give such an indentification, and then started to compute if the actions are equivalent, I give all these computations. In case iv) and v) I got stuck. So I am asking if anybody could help me resolving these points? Now the computations: Given two actions of $G := PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ on two sets, $\Omega := \mathbb F^2$ and $\Gamma := \mathbb F_{\infty}$. Then an operation of a group $G$ on two sets $\Omega, \Gamma$ is called equivalent if there exists a bijection $\lambda : \Omega \to \Gamma$ such that $$  \lambda(\alpha^g) = \lambda(\alpha)^g $$ for all $g \in G$. The bijection is $\lambda((x,y)^T) = x/y$ if $y \ne 1$ and $\lambda((x,0)^T) := \infty$ otherwise. An element of $g \in PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ is represented by four numbers $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb F$ such that $ad - bc = 1$. This could be viewed as a matrix modulo $\{I, -I\}$, or as a mapping as written at the beginning. So if $(x,y)^T \in \mathbb F^2$ we define the action by matrix multiplication, and for $x \in \mathbb F_{\infty}$ by applying the mapping. Now let $g \in PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ and let $a,b,c,d$ the corresponding numbers (up to a common constant). i) $y \ne 0, cx + dy \ne 0$ Then \begin{align*}  \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right)   & = \lambda\left( \begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{pmatrix} \right)  = \frac{ax + by}{cx + dy}  = \frac{a(x/y) + b}{c(x/y) + d} = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g. \end{align*} ii) $y = 0, cx + dy \ne 0$. Then $x \ne 0$ and $c \ne 0$ is implied. \begin{align*}  \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right)   & = \lambda\left( \begin{pmatrix} ax \\ cx  \end{pmatrix} \right)  = \frac{ax}{cx}  = \frac{a}{c}  = \infty^g  = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g. \end{align*} iii) $y = 0, cx + dy = 0, c = 0$.  \begin{align*}  \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right)  = \infty  = \infty^g  = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g \end{align*} iv) $y = 0, cx + dy = 0, c \ne 0$ Then we must have $x = 0$. Hence $\lambda((0,0)^g) = \lambda((0,0))$ and this should equal $\lambda((0,0))^g$, hence $\lambda((0,0))^g$ must be a fixed point of each $g$ with the above conditions. But I do not see what this fixed point should be? The only reasonable choice would be $\lambda((0,0)) = \infty$, but that does not works out as for $c \ne 0$ we have $\infty^g = a/c$. v) $y \ne 0, cx + dy = 0$. \begin{align*}  \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right) = \infty  \end{align*} Here $\lambda((x,y)) = x/y$ and $(x/y)^g = (a(x/y) + b)/(c(x/y) + d)$, and this must equal $\infty$, but it does only if $y = 0$ (as then $\lambda((x,y)) = \infty)$ or $(-d/c)^g = \infty$ is also another value that gives $\infty$, but in general we do not have $x = -d, y = c$ in this situation. So how to go on? EDIT : With Derek's answer I am able to resolve my issues: iv) As this gives $x = 0, y = 0$ the argument does not desribe a line, therefore this case is excluded. v) Here $cx + dy = 0$ implies $\langle (x,y)^T \rangle = \langle (-d, c)^T \rangle$ if $(-d, c) \ne (0,0)$ (note $(-d,c) = (0,0)$ is not possible anyway). Now  $$ \lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle^g) = \lambda(\langle (ax + by,0)^T \rangle) = \infty. $$ On the other side we have $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle) = \lambda(\langle (-d, c)^T \rangle) = -d/c$ if $c \ne 0$, and $\lambda(\langle (-d, c)^T\rangle) = \infty$ if $c = 0$. An now by convention $(-d/c)^g = \infty$ for $c \ne 0$ and $\infty^g = \infty$ (see wikipedia:Möbius transformation ). So that the equality asserted for equivalent actions holds. Now suppose $c = 0$, then by $ad - bc = 1$ we must have $d \ne 0$ and by convention $\infty^g = \infty$ then. Further as  above $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle^g) = \infty$ and $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle) = \infty = \infty^g$ the equation for equivalent actions hold. If $d = 0$, then $c \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$, and $y \ne 0$ together with $cx + dy = 0$ implies $x = 0$. This gives $$  \lambda(\langle (0,y)^T \rangle^g)  = \lambda(\langle (by, dy)^T \rangle)  = \lambda(\langle (b, 0)^T \rangle)  = \infty. $$ On the other side $\lambda(\langle (0,y) \rangle) = 0$, so we must have $0^g = \infty$ if $d = 0$ and the argument ist $0$? I guess this would be natural convention by looking at the mapping side, as then $g$ would be the mapping $$  \frac{ax + b}{cx} $$ and for $x = 0$ setting the value of this ""division by zero"" to $\infty$ might be a natural definition (anyway, the convention $0^g = \infty$ for $d = 0$ is included in $(-d/c)^g = \infty$).","This question is closely related to this one.

In one part of the maths/logic, I have to derive, then apply a transform between two cartesian coordinate systems using a rotate, uniform-scale, translate, and an optional flip operation. The resulting transformation will preserve angles as well as the aspect-ratio (due to the uniform-scale). Is there a specific mathematical name for this combined transform? I want to make sure I get the terminology in the code as correct (and succinct) as possible.","I'm working on software that involves transforming between different mapping coordinate systems.

I also don't know how to prove they are parallel without real numbers, because those variables could represent any plane (right?).
