Prove that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable. Background A family $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable if given $\epsilon>0$, there exists $M$ such that $$\int_{\{x: |f_n(x)|>M\}} |f_n(x) d\mu<\epsilon$$ for each $n$. Along with the usual limit theorems (Monotone Convergence, LDCT, Fatou's Lemma), the following is also known: Theorem (Vitali): Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure. If $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e., and $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable, then $\int |f_n -f| \rightarrow 0.$ On the other hand, if $f_n \rightarrow f$ a.e., each $f_n$ is integrable, $f$ is integrable, and $\int |f_n-f| \rightarrow 0$, then $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable. Attempt Let $E=\{x: |f_n|\geq 1\}$ and $m\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{m}<\epsilon$.  Then $|f_n|^{1+1/n}\leq |f_n|^{1+\epsilon}$ for all $x \in E$ and $k\geq M$. Consequently, \begin{align*} \int_E |f_n|^{1+1/k} \ d\mu &\leq \int_E |f_n|^{1+\epsilon} \ d\mu \\ &\leq \sup_n \int_E |f_n|^{1+\epsilon}\\ &<\infty. \end{align*} Thus, since $|f_n|^{1+1/k} \rightarrow |f_n|$ on $E$ we see by the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem that $\int_E |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_E|f_n|\ d\mu.$ Furthermore, on $E^c,$  $$|f_n|^{1+1/n}\leq |f_n|< 1$$ so by the monotone convergence theorem we have $\int_{E^c} |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_{E^c}|f_n| \ d\mu$. Combining these two facts we see that $$\int |f_n|^{1+1/n}\ d\mu \rightarrow \int_{E^c}|f_n| \ d\mu$$ and by the theorem above, $\{|f_n|^{1+1/k}\}$ is uniformly integrable. Since $\{|f_n|\}\subset \{|f_n|^{1+1/k}\}$, we have the result.

In Chapter 2, Exercise 19, Folland asks for sequences of functions $f_n \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ with $f_n \to f$ uniformly, but such that one of the conclusions $f \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ or $\int f_n \to \int f$ fails.  I can find examples of each conclusion failing, but cannot seem to find a single example where both conclusions fail in the following way: What is an example of a sequence of functions $f_n \in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ with $f_n \to f$ uniformly, but such that $\int f = \pm \infty$ (by which I mean that exactly one of $\int f^+$ or $\int f^-$ is $+\infty$) and also $\int f_n \not \to \int f$? My examples: (1) $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{x}\chi_{(1,n)}(x)$.  The uniform limit $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\chi_{(1,\infty)}(x)$ has $\int f = +\infty$.  However, we also have $\int f_n = \log(n) \to \infty = \int f$. (2) $f_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}\chi_{(0,n)}(x)$.  We have $\int f_n = 1 \not \to \int f = 0$, but now $\int f = 0 \neq \pm \infty$.

Here are two examples I did that I do not think are justified. Example 1: Show that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^\infty ne^{-nx}\sin(1/x) \ dx$$ exists and determine its value. Solution: Let $u=nx$. Then we may rewrite the integral as $$\int_0^\infty e^{-u}\sin\left(\frac{n}{u}\right) \ du.$$ Note that $$\bigg\lvert e^{-u}\sin\left(\frac{n}{u}\right)\bigg\rvert\leq e^{-u},$$ and since $e^{-u}$ is integrable, the LDCT applies. The limit is then $0$. Example 2: Let $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be integrable and let $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be bounded, measurable, and continuous at $1$. prove that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^nf\left(1+\frac{x}{n^2}\right)g(x) \ dx$$ exists and determine its value.

Here are two examples I did that I do not think are justified. Example 1: Show that $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^\infty ne^{-nx}\sin(1/x) \ dx$$ exists and determine its value. Solution: Let $u=nx$. Then we may rewrite the integral as $$\int_0^\infty e^{-u}\sin\left(\frac{n}{u}\right) \ du.$$ Note that $$\bigg\lvert e^{-u}\sin\left(\frac{n}{u}\right)\bigg\rvert\leq e^{-u},$$ and since $e^{-u}$ is integrable, the LDCT applies. The limit is then $0$. Example 2: Let $g:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be integrable and let $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be bounded, measurable, and continuous at $1$. prove that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{-n}^nf\left(1+\frac{x}{n^2}\right)g(x) \ dx$$ exists and determine its value.

But I can not proceed any further, partially due to the fact that since $f$ is not invertible, it is very difficult to make the measure thus constructed really invariant globally. I was told that the following theorem should be used. A set of probability Borel measures on X, $\Gamma$, is called tight, if for any $\varepsilon$, there is some compact subset $K$ such that $\mu(K)>1-\varepsilon$ for any $\mu\in \Gamma$. The theorem asserts that if $\Gamma$ is tight, then any sequence of measures $\mu_n$ in $\Gamma$ admits some convergent subsequence, with respect the weak$^*$ topology. So what we need is to find a sequence of measures which are ""quasi invariant"", and then to take the limit to make things work. But I am still stuck here. Could anyone help me with this?

99,Sufficient condition for Uniform integrability,Sufficient condition for Uniform integrability,,"The following is a problem that I've been struggling hard to prove. Any help would be appreciated. Suppose $\mu$ is a finite measure and for some $\gamma>0$ $$ \sup_n \int |f_n|^{1+\gamma} \ d\mu < \infty $$ Prove that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly integrable, i.e given an $\epsilon>0$ there exists $M$ such that $\displaystyle \sup_{n} \int_{\{x:|f_n(x)|> M \}} |f_n(x)|\  d\mu < \epsilon$ My attempt to solve: I wrote $\int |f_n|^{1+\gamma} \ d\mu = \int_{\{x:|f_n(x)|> M \}} |f_n|^{1+\gamma} \ d\mu + \int_{\{x:|f_n(x)|\leq M \}} |f_n|^{1+\gamma} \ d\mu$. How do I get rid of $1+\gamma\ ?$","The following is a problem that I've been struggling hard to prove. Any help would be appreciated.
