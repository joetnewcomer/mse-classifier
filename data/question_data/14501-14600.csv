98,Evaluate $\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^2e^{\arctan x}}{\sqrt{{1+x^2}}}\ \mathrm{d}x$,Evaluate,\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^2e^{\arctan x}}{\sqrt{{1+x^2}}}\ \mathrm{d}x,"$$\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^2e^{\arctan x}}{\sqrt{{1+x^2}}}\ \mathrm{d}x$$ My try: I tried substituting $x= \tan\theta$ and got, $\displaystyle\int e^\theta \tan^2\theta \sec\theta\ \mathrm{d}\theta$ and cannot move forward. so I thought of finding two integrals( $I$ and $J$ )one of which is required and the other is taken such that $I+J, I-J$ are easy to find.but couldn't find such $J$ $\left(I=\displaystyle\int\frac{x^2e^{\arctan x}}{1+x^2}\ \mathrm{d}x\right)$ Also, I don't think I could make use of definite integral properties. WolframAlpha result for the integral is $\frac{(x-1)\sqrt{1+x^2}e^{arctanx}}{2}+C$ I also want to know how you got the idea for the solution.","My try: I tried substituting and got, and cannot move forward. so I thought of finding two integrals( and )one of which is required and the other is taken such that are easy to find.but couldn't find such Also, I don't think I could make use of definite integral properties.
