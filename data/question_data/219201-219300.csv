0,What geometrical obstructions to $M$ being flat do elements which map to 0 in $M \otimes I$ represent?,What geometrical obstructions to  being flat do elements which map to 0 in  represent?,M M \otimes I,"I'm trying to get geometric intuition for the notion of a flat module over a ring, and am running into some problems with my intuition. I am comfortable with flat modules and tensor products from the commutative side, so when I ask what an object ""is"", I mean how can I translate the commutative algebra into geometric reasoning. Consider $M=\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xz-y)$ as an $R=\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ module. As was explained very well by many users here: Why isn't $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/(xz-y)$ a flat $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$-module , the reason that $M$ is not flat as an $R$-module is because if we consider the ideal $I=(x,y)$, then $M \otimes I$ contains the non-zero element $1 \otimes y-z \otimes x$, which is 0 if considered as an element of $M$ (it happens to have x-torsion). We also know that the geometric reason for the failure of flatness is that a whole line is mapped to $(0,0)$ when we map the variety corresponding to $M$ to the plane (the variety corresponding to $R$). My question is what geometric ""object"" exactly is $1 \otimes y-z \otimes x$, which maps to $0$ when we consider multiplication but happens to be non-zero when we consider some other random bilinear form, and how does this object correspond to a non-constant dimensional fiber if we consider it geometrically? If the object is in fact just something we can apply bilinear forms to, then I would like to know if the general bilinear forms on $M \times I$ are possibly ""geometrical"" in some sense (i.e. products of nth derivatives of functions, which could correspond to nth order behavior around a specific point). On a related note, I'm not sure what the ""functions"" in $M \otimes \kappa(P)$ actually correspond to (here $\kappa$ mean residue class field); I would really appreciate if anyone could clear this up (specifically, what exactly do these functions ""act on"", and where do they ""live""). Thank you, Rofler Edit: I thought understanding $M \otimes \kappa(P)$ would shed some light on $M \otimes P$, but actually the former is actually easy to understand, since none of the elements in the tensor products are non-elementary, and we've really just inverted a few functions, and set a few others to be $0$. $M \otimes P$ on the other hand...","I'm trying to get geometric intuition for the notion of a flat module over a ring, and am running into some problems with my intuition.

If I want to motivate their definition, I sort of naturally go through the following implications in my head: to study a problem over the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ (or more generally, the ring of integers of a number field) the strategy is to localise the problem at a prime $p$ , as to focus around it and worry about the problem ' one point at a time ', so-to-speak; we (literally, now) localise at the prime $p$ , just as one would do with the ring of regular functions on a variety, and replace $\mathbb{Z}$ with the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)} := \{ \frac{x}{y} \in \mathbb{Q} \mid p\nmid y \}$ ; we can then complete at the maximal ideal $(p) \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ to obtain the $p$ -adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , with the benefit that now there's access to approximation techniques such as Hensel's lemma, and the newly obtained ring has pretty much all the same algebraic properties as $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ because of its identical valuation theory.

26,Geometric meaning of primary decomposition,Geometric meaning of primary decomposition,,"In the book "" Commutative Algebra with a view toward Algebraic Geometry "" of David Eisenbud, he wrote about the Geometric interpretation of primary decomposition. I summarize as follows : Let $I=\cap_{j}I_{j}$ be a minimal primary decomposition of $I$ , where $I$ is an ideal in $k[x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}]$ . Then $Z(I)=\cup_{j}Z(I_{j})$ . So, if $I$ is a radical ideal then each of $I_{j}$ is a prime ideal minimal over $I$ , and the primary decomposition give us the decomposition of $Z(I)$ as the union of irreducible variety $Z(I_{j})$ . My thinking is follows: If $I=\cap_{j}I_{j}$ is a primary decomposition of $I$ then each $I_j$ is a primary ideal then its radical $radI_{j}$ is a prime ideal $p_j$ . Then $Z(I_{j})=Z(p_{i})$ and because $p_j$ are prime ideals, $Z(p_{j})$ are irreducible varieties. Thus, $Z(I)=\cup_{j}Z(I_{j})$ is a decomposition of $Z(I)$ into irreducible components.

Question: in my RS surface course the genus for a compact RS was defined as the number of holes, formally half of the dimension of the first de rham cohomology group (or singular with coefficients in some field of characteristic zero). Now i encountered the algebraic definition: the dimension of the first cohomology group of the structure sheaf. I expect them to be the same, but did not find a quick proof. Can anyone show me how this works? I learned that de rham cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$ corresponds to sheaf cohomology of the constant sheaf $\mathbb{C}$. However i'm not sure, can someone either confirm this or tell me why it's not true? If it is true, i find it hard to work with, since up till now i've been basically using Serre duality and Riemann Roch for bundles to reduce computing homology to computing spaces of global sections, however since the constant sheaf is not locally free i cannot apply this trick (or can i?). Also, the constant sheaf makes sense both algebraically and analytically, so which one should i take in the de rham <-> constant sheaf correspondence? Or do both work?

Am i limiting myself unnecessarily by using Riemann Roch and Serre duality just for bundles, i.e. can i use them for all sheaves? Lastly, when answering my questions, it would be immensely appreciated if you could elaborate a little on how to use GAGA in general. Hope this makes sense, i suspect them to be silly questions once i understand them, but right now it's a fuzz to me..

Clearly it induces a split monomorphism, and it is an isomorphism iff the two sections $i_0,i_1 : X \to X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ induce the same homomorphism on Picard groups, i.e. $i_0^* \mathcal{L} \cong i_1^* \mathcal{L}$ for every line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$. There are various special cases where this is true: 1) When $X$ is noetherian, separated, integral and locally factorial, it follows from Prop. 6.6 (homotopy invariance of the class group à la Weil) and Corollary 6.16 (isomorphism between the class group and the Picard group) in Hartshorne's book. I wonder if there is a more direct proof which doesn't take the detour with Weil divisors, but this is not my main question here. 2) It is also true when $X$ is affine and factorial (not necessarily noetherian), since one can check directly that the Picard group of a factorial domain vanishes. It then also follows when $X$ is covered by affine factorial schemes. 3) If $X$ is integral projective over an algebraically closed field  with $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)=0$, it is a special case of Ex.

Clearly it induces a split monomorphism, and it is an isomorphism iff the two sections $i_0,i_1 : X \to X \times \mathbb{A}^1$ induce the same homomorphism on Picard groups, i.e. $i_0^* \mathcal{L} \cong i_1^* \mathcal{L}$ for every line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X \times \mathbb{A}^1$. There are various special cases where this is true: 1) When $X$ is noetherian, separated, integral and locally factorial, it follows from Prop. 6.6 (homotopy invariance of the class group à la Weil) and Corollary 6.16 (isomorphism between the class group and the Picard group) in Hartshorne's book. I wonder if there is a more direct proof which doesn't take the detour with Weil divisors, but this is not my main question here. 2) It is also true when $X$ is affine and factorial (not necessarily noetherian), since one can check directly that the Picard group of a factorial domain vanishes. It then also follows when $X$ is covered by affine factorial schemes. 3) If $X$ is integral projective over an algebraically closed field  with $H^1(X,\mathcal{O}_X)=0$, it is a special case of Ex.

47,Why are period integrals naïve periods?,Why are period integrals naïve periods?,,"Apologies for the long question. I recall the definition of a (naïve) period according to Kontsevitch and Zagier [KS] : A (naïve) period is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are absolutely convergent integrals of rational functions with rational coefficients on domains of $\mathbb R^d$ bounded by polynomial inequalities with rational coefficients. For example, $$\pi = \iint_{x^2+y^2 \leq 1} dx dy$$ is a period, whereas $e$ is conjecturally not a period. As [KS] point out, the following definition is equivalent: A period is a complex number which is an absolutely convergent integral of an algebraic function defined over $\mathbb Q$, on a domains of $\mathbb R^d$ bounded by polynomial inequalities with real algebraic coefficients. To illustrate, remark that for $\lambda>1 \in \mathbb Q$, $$2\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}}$$ is a period according to the second definition, but not obviously to the first one. But it can be rewritten as $$\iint_{0 \leq x \leq 1, y^2 \leq x(x-1)(x-\lambda)} dx dy,$$ and so it is a period also according to the first definition. Kontsevitch and Zagier point out that the periods of algebraic varieties in the classical sense are naïve periods. Let $X/\mathbb Q$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb Q$ of dimension $d$, and $\omega \in H^0(X, \Omega^d_{X/\mathbb Q})$ a global algebraic differential form of top degree on $X$. Being of top degree, the form $\omega$ is automatically closed, and gives rise to a de Rham cohomology class $[\omega] \in H^d_{dR}(X/\mathbb C)$ in the middle cohomology of the variety $X(\mathbb C)$, which has real dimension $2d$. Now let $D$ be a divisor on $X$ with normal crossings, and let $[\sigma] \in H_d(X(\mathbb C), D(\mathbb C), \mathbb Q)$ be a homology class relative to $D$, represented by a $d$-chain whose boundary lies on $D$. Then the integral $$\int_\sigma \omega|_{\sigma}$$ depends only on the relative homology class of $\sigma$ and on the cohomology class of $\omega$. Claim : the integral $\int_\sigma \omega|_{\sigma}$ is a period. Kontsevitch and Zagier seem to treat this as an obvious fact. It seems to me like a fairly difficult theorem. Am I overlooking a simple proof? To illustrate, let $X$ is the elliptic curve $y^2z=x(x-z)(x-\lambda z)$,  $\omega = dx/y$ is the invariant differential on $X$, and $D$ is the empty divisor,  then the periods of $\omega$ in this sense are precisely the linear combinations of the classical period integrals $$2\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}}, 2\int_\lambda^\infty \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}},$$ which shows that the statement is true as both of these integrals are naïve periods. In order to get these integral formulas, we treat $X$ as a degree $2$ ramified covering of $\mathbb P^1$ via $(x,y) \mapsto x$; then $y$ becomes a multi-valued function on $\mathbb A^1$ with branch points at $\lambda = 0,1,\lambda, \infty$. The first homology of $X(\mathbb C)$ is generated by two cycles whose image in $\mathbb P^1(\mathbb C)$ circle the branch cuts $[0,1]$ and $[\lambda, \infty] \subseteq \mathbb P^1(\mathbb R)$ clockwise.  Thus it suffices to see that the integrals of $\omega$ along these cycles are periods. Consider a $1$-cycle $\sigma$ which circles the branch cut $[0,1]$ clockwise on the branch of $y$ which is positive for real $x$ large enough. This cycle is homologous to the cycle which goes from $0$ to $1$ along the positive branch of $y$, then goes back to $1$ along the negative branch. Thus $$\int_\sigma \omega = \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}} - \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{-\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}} = 2 \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}}.$$ Very good. But what about a variety of dimension $d>1$? I am happy with supposing that the divisor $D$ is empty, so that $[\sigma]$ is the homology class of a $d$-cycle. Here is how I thought one might prove that the integral $\int_\sigma \omega$ is a period. Let $U$ be an affine open subvariety of $X$ such that $U(\mathbb C)$ contains the image of the $d$-cycle $\sigma$. By the Noether normalization lemma, there is a finite map $U \to \mathbb A^d$, and an open $V\subseteq \mathbb A^d$ such that the restriction $U' \to V$ is finite étale of some degree $n$. Let us suppose still that $U'(\mathbb C)$ contains the image of $\sigma$.  Locally in the complex topology of $V(\mathbb C)$, the morphism $U' \to V$ has $n$ sections along which we can pull back the differential $\omega$, to get a multivalued differential $\omega$ on $V$. Let  $\sigma'$ denote the $d$-cycle on $V(\mathbb C)$ obtained by composing $\sigma$ with $U'(\mathbb C) \to V(\mathbb C)$; the integral $$\int_{\sigma'}\omega$$ has $n$ possible values, depending on the branch of $\omega$ which is chosen (and then analytically continued along $\sigma'$). It should therefore be proven that the integrals $\int_{\sigma'} \omega$ are periods. The problem is that the cycle $\sigma$ is only differentiable. For instance, in the example above, if we re-parametrize the integral $$\int_0^1 \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}}$$ by a diffeomorphism $t \mapsto x(t)$ of the interval, preserving the boundary, then we get $$\int_0^1 \frac{x'(t) dt }{\sqrt{x(t)(x(t)-1)(x(t)-\lambda)}}$$ which is not recognizable as a period anymore. Hence, it appears crucial that the homology class of a path $\sigma$ circling the branch cut $[0,1]$ can be represented also by a path which is piecewise-linear , namely the path which goes from $0$ to $1$ in constant time on the top sheet and goes back to $0$ in constant time on the bottom sheet. It appears to me that the statement that $\int_{\sigma'} \omega$ is a period depends on the fact that any $d$-cycle $\sigma$ on $V(\mathbb C) \subseteq \mathbb A^d(\mathbb C)$ is homologous to one which is piecewise-linear, or even piecewise-polynomial, with algebraic coefficients. It seems to me that this is true, although it is probably a fairly difficult theorem of algebraic topology. Is my way of approaching this problem correct, or am I overlooking something much simpler?

I recall the definition of a (naïve) period according to Kontsevitch and Zagier [KS] : A (naïve) period is a complex number whose real and imaginary parts are absolutely convergent integrals of rational functions with rational coefficients on domains of $\mathbb R^d$ bounded by polynomial inequalities with rational coefficients. For example, $$\pi = \iint_{x^2+y^2 \leq 1} dx dy$$ is a period, whereas $e$ is conjecturally not a period.

Is there an easy-to-test necessary and sufficient condition on $f$ such that $f$ is in the ideal of $R$ generated by its partial derivatives $\partial_if$ ? Geometrically, $f\in \left(\partial_1 f,\dots, \partial_n f\right)$ is the statement that the map $f:\mathbb{A}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{A}^1$ is a submersion anywhere it is nonzero. ( Edit per a comment of @Evangelion045: this isn't quite true. $f\in(\partial_1f,\dots,\partial_n f)$ implies that $f$ is a submersion everywhere it's nonzero, but in the opposite direction, $f$ being  a sumbersion everywhere it's nonzero only implies $f$ is in the radical of the ideal generated by its partials.) A sufficient condition is if $f$ is homogeneous of degree $d$ , due to Euler's formula $$ d\cdot f = \sum_i x_i\partial_i f$$ I was led to the question by the surprise discovery that the statement is also true if $f$ happens to be the resolvent cubic of a monic quartic polynomial $x^4 - \sigma_1x^3 +\sigma_2x^2 - \sigma_3x +\sigma_4$ , which is an inhomogeneous polynomial of degree three in the four coefficients $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_4$ plus an auxiliary variable $\Lambda$ . But the resolvent cubic is, to be sure, weighted homogeneous (with weight $i$ for $\sigma_i$ and weight $2$ for $\Lambda$ ). And sure enough, the proof for Euler's formula generalizes to this case. We have $$ d\cdot f = \sum_i d_ix_i\partial_if$$ where $d_i$ is the weight of $x_i$ and $d$ is the weighted degree of $f$ . Thus the existence of a set of weights making $f$ weighted homogeneous is also a sufficient criterion. (A google search revealed an analytic generalization in a book of Arnol'd , citing Saito.) However, it's not quite necessary: any (nonconstant) linear function also trivially has $f\in \left(\partial_1 f,\dots,\partial_n f\right)$ since the latter is the unit ideal, while if its constant term is nonzero then it is not homogeneous with respect to any set of (positive integer) weights.

Let $L=k(X_1,\ldots,X_r)$ and $L_s$ the separable closure of $L$ is $K(X)$. Then we proove that for all $b\in K(X)\setminus L_s$ such that $b^p\in L_s$, $L_s[b]$ is a finite separable extension of an (other) purely transcental extension $k(Y_1,\ldots,Y_q)$: I'm ok with that. My problem and question come with the conclusion: ""This imply the proposition by decomposing $K(X)/L_s$ into a sequence of purely inseparable extensions of degree $p = \operatorname{char}(k)$."" I don't understand that. I see that $K(X)=L_s[b_1,\ldots,b_m]$ so $L_s[b]$ would be a first step for induction? But for that I need that all the $b_i$ verifiy $b_i^p\in L_s$ and I don't see how to make that (but I know that $K(X)$ is purely inseparable over $L_s$ but it doesn't help me.) Then I would need to continue with $L_s[b_1,b_2]$ but how to construct a purely transcendal extension $k(Z_1,\ldots,Z_q)$ over that $L_s[b_1,b_2]$ is finite separable?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'field-theory', 'arithmetic-geometry']"

93,Algebraic versus topological line bundles,Algebraic versus topological line bundles,,"Let $X$ be a CW complex. The (isomorphism classes of) complex line bundles on $X$ are classified by the homotopy classes of maps $X \to \mathbb{CP}^\infty$, that is by the elements of $H^2(X, \mathbb{Z})$.  It is also true that the tensor product of line bundles corresponds to adding cohomology classes. It follows that if $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then the line bundles of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are generated by the tensor powers of the tautological line bundle, or, equivalently, by the tensor powers of the sheaf typically denoted  $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in algebraic geometry (because the dual of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ is the tautological bundle). It is also true that the isomorphism classes of algebraic line bundles on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ forms  a group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$, given by the powers of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, as one can see by studying the Weil class group. It follows that the isomorphism classes of line bundles are the same in both the algebraic and the topological category. The above observation is also true for affine $n$-space, because the topological line bundles are trivial ($\mathbb{C}^n$ being contractible), and the algebraic ones are as well (the polynomial ring being a UFD). To what extent is this true in general?","Let $X$ be a CW complex.
