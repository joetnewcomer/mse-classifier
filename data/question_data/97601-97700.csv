0,Coefficients of this Taylor series are bounded,Coefficients of this Taylor series are bounded,,"Let $f(z)$ be a function that's analytic in the open unit disk, and also in a region containing the closed unit disk with the exception of a few simple poles (i.e. the poles have degree 1) that lie outside the open unit disk. Show that the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of f(z) at 0 (we know its radius is at least the unit disk) are bounded. I could use help with this. What I've tried: we can multiply $f(z)$ by $(z-c_1)(z-c_2)...$ where $c_1,...$ are the singularities to get an analytic function, and then express the series of $(z-c_1)(z-c_2)...f(z)$ in terms of $f(z)$'s series to get a constraint on the coefficients (since the analytic function's coefficients will go to 0). But this is tedious and the constraint doesn't seem good enough to show boundedness. Update: Sorry, it looks like I confused a few people (as seen by the hints below). To clarify, $f$ is analytic in the open unit disk. We're not given analyticity in the closed unit disk. I should also emphasize that the poles are of degree 1 at the most. This isn't a homework question (just an exercise from a textbook), so feel free to post either hints or whole answers.","Let $f(z)$ be a function that's analytic in the open unit disk, and also in a region containing the closed unit disk with the exception of a few simple poles (i.e. the poles have degree 1) that lie outside the open unit disk.

28,Antiholomorphic (Co)Tangent Space/Bundle,Antiholomorphic (Co)Tangent Space/Bundle,,"So, I have a question concerning $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ (defined below) when $X$ is a Riemann Surface. Let me give a little bit of background to whet your appetite (for question answering!) Background So, we are dealing with a Riemann Surface $X$ (a connected complex manifold of dimension one). Given a point $x\in X$ we can form the holomorphic cotangent bundle at $x$ , denoted $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ for me, as follows: start by considering holomorphic function elements $(f,U)$ at $x$ --namely, $U$ is some neighborhood of $x$ , and $f\in\mathcal{O}(U)$ (holomorphic functions on $U$ ). We denote the set of all such function elements at $x$ by $\mathcal{H}_x$ . We can then define an equivalence relation on $\mathcal{H}_x$ by declaring that $(f,U)\sim(g,V)$ if $f\mid_W=g\mid_W$ for some open neighborhood $W\subseteq U\cap V$ of $x$ . The set of equivalence classes of $\mathcal{H}_x/\sim$ will be denoted $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ --called the holomorphic germs at $x$ . We then define an equivalence relation on the germs, by saying that two germs $f$ and $g$ at $x$ (domains are unimportant) are equivalent if $(f\circ z^{-1})'(z(x))=(g\circ z^{-1})'(z(x))$ for some chart $(z,U)$ at $x$ . We denote the quotient of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ by this equivalence relation as $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ and call it, as I've already said, the holomorphic cotangent bundle at $x$ . We denote the equivalence class of $f$ in $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ as $df(x)$ . $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ carries a well-defined vector space structure which is defined (and it is well-defined!) by $df(x)+\lambda dg(x)=d(f+\lambda g)(x)$ . We can then glue all of the holomorphic cotangent spaces together to get the holomorphic cotangent bundle $T_X^{\ast1,0}$ which is a holomorphic line bundle with local trivilizations $\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbb{C}:cdz(x)\mapsto (x,c)$ (where, as usual, $(z,U)$ is a chart on $X$ -- $\{dz(x)\}$ forms a basis of $T_{X,x}^{\ast1,0}$ so this makes sense) and transition functions $t_{\alpha\beta}=(z_\beta\circ z_\alpha^{-1})')\circ z_\alpha$ . Ok, so that's all fine. It makes one-hundred percent sense to me--both symbolically and intuitively. The issue then comes in with defining $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . I understand it symbolically, it's just the tangent bundle one gets by conjugating the holomorphic cotangent bundles transition functions. The issue is with the intuition. The holomorphic tangent and cotangent bundle were defined so concretely, it would be nice to have a concrete description of $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . After a little bit of thought, it seems that there is a very natural/concrete way to define $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ . Namely, perform almost the exact same procedure one did with the holomorphic cotangent bundle except one replaces holomorphic germs with antiholomorphic germs (i.e. replace normal holomorphic functions $f:X\to\mathbb{C}$ with functions whose conjugate is holomorphic) and replace all the derivatives with respect to $z$ , to derivatives with respect to $\bar{z}$ . Now, I'm fairly convinced that this is all kosher, but it begs two questions: a) why isn't this the definition, why is the definition via just transition functions favorable and b) $T_{X,x}^{\ast0,1}$ is not a holomorphic line bundle, but it's damn close--it's some kind of ""antiholomorphic line bundle""--does this idea hold any significance?

Then by the Cauchy's Integral Formula: $$\int_{|z|=1} (2\pm(z + z^{-1}))\frac{f(z)}{z}\mathbb dz =\int_{|z|=1} \frac{h(z)}{z^{2}} \mathbb dz = 2\pi i \frac{h'(0)}{1!}$$ But $h'(0) = 2f(0) \pm f'(0)$.",,['complex-analysis']

An Introduction"" motivates the titular object in mainly two different ways. First, there is the idea of succesively lifting solutions modulo prime powers formalised by Hensel's Lemma and, second, there is something he dubs Hensel's Analogy . Let me expand on the latter (which is more or less the table on page $1$ here ). Recall that any positive integer $n$ can be expanded into powers of any fixed prime number $p$ defining its $p$ -adic expansion. More explicitly, there are non-negative integers $a_k$ for $k=0,\dots,m$ so that $0\le a_i<p$ and $$ n=\sum_{k=0}^m a_kp^k\,. $$ Put differently, any positive integer is expressible as a polynomial in $p$ with coefficients between $0$ and $p-1$ . It then seems natural to ask whether this can be extended to all (positive) rational numbers by somewhat simplifying the resulting fraction of polynomials. Drawing from complex analysis we know that for polynomials $P(z),Q(z)\in\mathbb C[z]$ we can expand $$ \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} =\sum_{k=-m}^\infty a_k(z-\alpha)^k $$ for, say, $\alpha$ a root of $Q(z)$ . This is the Laurent series of the rational function. Jumping ahead, the $p$ -adic numbers $\mathbb Q_p$ give a way of making sense of such infinite series in powers of the fixed prime $p$ corresponding to the ""local"" study at $p$ . The crucial technical part here is to introduce a sensible notion of convergence to allow infinite power series in place of mere polynomials. We arrive then at $\mathbb Q_p$ having as elements $$ \sum_{k=-m}^\infty a_kp^k $$ with integers $0\le a_k<p$ . This naturally extends the $p$ -adic expansions we are used to while simultaneously introducing a very useful and powerful number theoretic tool. However, I was wondering: Is there more to Hensel's Analogy then formal similarities? Conceptually, studying the local fields $\mathbb Q_p$ is a way of focusing on the prime $p$ . For example, any number field $K/\mathbb Q$ has a corresponding local extensions $K_{\mathfrak p}/\mathbb Q_p$ with $\mathfrak p\mid p$ in which we can more easily study the, say, ramification behavior of $K/\mathbb Q$ at $p$ . So the $p$ -adic numbers provide a framework for the ""local"" study near $p$ similar to what a Laurent series expansion does for a rational function (which is also an idea close to algebraic geometry). Hence the analogy seems to hold some truth. But how much truth does Hensel's Analogy really hold? That is, what non-trivial techniques or results (if any) can be carried over from complex analysis to number theory?

74,Proof verification: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx\ =\ \pi\ln\left(2\right)$.,Proof verification: .,\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx\ =\ \pi\ln\left(2\right),"This is more of a post I wanted to share. I have decided to tackle the following integral via contour integration: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx.$$ Proof. Let that integral equal $I$ . Let $$f(z) = \frac{\text{Log}{(z+i)}}{z^2+1},$$ where Log represents the principal logarithm. We shall traverse, in a counterclockwise direction, a path $C$ defined by $$C = \left[-R,R\right] \cup \Gamma,$$ which is a large semicircle of radius R above the real axis. We can express the contour integral over $C$ as $$\oint_Cf(z)dz = \int_{-R}^{R}f(z)dz + \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz$$ Notice the only singularity that resides in $C$ is $i$ . Taking the residue at that pole yields $$\oint_Cf(z)dz = 2\pi i\text{Res}{(f(z),i)} = 2\pi i \lim_{z \to i}f(z) = \pi\ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2},$$ after evaluating the limit and doing some algebra. By transitivity and taking the limit as R goes to infinity, we see that $$\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{-R}^{R}f(z)dz + \lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz = \pi\ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2}.$$ Let's call the first and second integrals $I_1$ and $I_2$ , respectively. Rewriting $I_1$ gives us $$\eqalign{\int_{-R}^{R} \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz    &= \int_{-R}^0 \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz + \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz \cr   &= \int_{R}^0 \frac{\text{Log}(-y+i)}{(-y)^2+1}d(-y) + \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}(z+i)}{z^2+1}dz \cr   &= \int_{0}^R \frac{\text{Log}((i-y)(i+y))}{y^2+1}dy \cr &= i\frac{\pi^2}{2} + \int_0^R \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy\cr}$$ after doing some basic manipulations and integration. Note if $|z| = R$ , then $z$ is on $R$ . Dealing with $I_2$ as $R$ approaches infinity, consider the following inequalities: $$|\text{Log}(z+i)| = |\ln|z+i| + i\text{Arg}(z+i)| \leq ||z+i| + i\pi| \leq R+1+\pi;$$ $$\left|z^2+1\right| \geq \left|\left|z^2\right|-1\right| = R^2 - 1.$$ By applying the ML-Inequality and Squeeze Theorem, we get $$0 \leq \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq |f(z)|\left(\frac{2\pi R}{2}\right) \leq \frac{R+1+\pi}{R^2-1}$$ $$\lim_{R \to \infty} 0 \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \frac{R+1+\pi}{R^2-1}$$ $$0 \leq \lim_{R \to \infty} \left|\int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz\right| \leq 0.$$ This implies that $$\lim_{R \to \infty} \int_{\Gamma}f(z)dz = 0.$$ Going back and taking R to infinity, we see that $$\eqalign{ \pi \ln{(2)} + i\frac{\pi^2}{2}    &= i\frac{\pi^2}{2} + \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy + 0 \cr   \pi \ln{(2)} &= \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy. \cr }$$ Letting $y = \sinh{(x)}$ , we get $$ \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\ln{(1+y^2)}}{1+y^2}dy = \int_0^{\infty}\frac{\ln{(\sinh^2{(x)}+1)}\cosh{(x)}}{\sinh^2{(x)}+1}dx = 2\int_0^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx. $$ Since $\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)$ is an even function, we see that $$2\int_0^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx.$$ Therefore, $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\operatorname{sech}\left(x\right)\ln\left(\cosh\left(x\right)\right)dx\ =\ \pi\ln\left(2\right).$$ Q.E.D.

95,Is a Lattice always uniformly discrete in $\mathbb{C}$?,Is a Lattice always uniformly discrete in ?,\mathbb{C},"The following definition of discreteness and uniform discreteness comes from Wikipedia. A subset $S$ of a metric space $(Y,d)$ is said to be discrete in $Y$ , if for all $x\in S$ , there exists some $\delta=\delta(x)>0$ such that $d(x,y)>\delta$ for all $y\in S\setminus\{x\}.$ A subset $S$ of a metric space $(Y,d)$ is said to be uniformly discrete in $S$ , if there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for any $x,y\in S$ , either $x=y$ or $d(x,y)>\delta$ . Now, Rick Miranda's Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces has the following construction. Consider the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ , and let $w_{1}, w_{2}\in\mathbb{C}$ be linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$ , and we fix this pair $w_{1}, w_{2}$ . Define the Lattice by $$L:=\mathbb{Z}w_{1}+\mathbb{Z}w_{2}=\{a_{1}w_{1}+a_{2}w_{2}:a_{1},a_{2}\in\mathbb{Z}\}.$$ Then, the books said: The lattice $L$ is a discrete subset of $\mathbb{C}$ , so there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $|w|>2\epsilon$ for every non-zero $w\in L$ . Fix such an $\epsilon$ , and.....(not relevant stuff starts). Given the context of his sentence, it seems that he is claiming that $L$ is in fact uniformly discrete in $\mathbb{C}$ . (Otherwise he cannot fix such $\epsilon$ , without fixing the choice of point from the Lattice, and the later proof seems assuming this $\epsilon$ works for everyone) Is this true? I looked it up online, but did not find any convincing reference. I tried to prove it. So, we write $w_{1}=x_{1}+iy_{1}$ and $w_{2}=x_{2}+iy_{2}$ , and we let $x,y\in L$ so that $x=w_{1}a_{1}+w_{2}a_{2}$ and $y=w_{1}b_{1}+w_{2}b_{2}$ , where $a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2}\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Then, the (complex norm) distance between $x$ and $y$ is \begin{align*} |x-y|^{2}&=|a_{1}w_{1}+a_{2}w_{2}-b_{1}w_{1}-b_{2}w_{2}|^{2}\\ &=|a_{1}x_{1}+ia_{1}y_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+ia_{2}y_{2}-b_{1}x_{1}-ib_{1}y_{1}-b_{2}x_{2}-ib_{2}y_{2}|^{2}\\ &=(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}-b_{1}x_{1}-b_{2}x_{2})^{2}+(a_{1}y_{1}+a_{2}y_{2}-b_{1}y_{1}-b_{2}y_{2})^{2}\\ &=\Bigg[x_{1}(a_{1}-b_{1})+x_{2}(a_{2}-b_{2})\Bigg]^{2}+\Bigg[y_{1}(a_{1}-b_{1})+y_{2}(a_{2}-b_{2})\Bigg]^{2}\\ &=\Bigg[x_{1}^{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+2x_{1}x_{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})+x_{2}^{2}(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}\Bigg]\\ &\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ +\Bigg[y_{1}^{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+2y_{1}y_{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})+y_{2}^{2}(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}\Bigg]\\ &\geq 2x_{1}x_{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})+2y_{1}y_{2}(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})\\ &=2(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})(y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}). \end{align*} What can I do further  I get a lower bound of this expression that does not depend on $a_{1},a_{2}$ and $b_{1},b_{2}$ ? (so does not depend on $x$ and $y$ ). For now, I have not utilized the fact that $a_{i},b_{i}\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Well, if we have a perfect scenario that $a_{1}>b_{1}\geq 0$ and $a_{2}>b_{2}\geq 0$ , then $$2(a_{1}-b_{1})(a_{2}-b_{2})(y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{2})>2\cdot 1\cdot 1(y_{1}y_{2}+x_{1}x_{2}),$$ is the desired bound. But I am not sure what to do if we are not in this kind of scenario (so I guess this gives us some sort of a counter-example?) Thank you! Edit 1: Okay, I think Rick Miranda actually means discrete. I will explain in the answer I will post on my own. Also, I will also point a proof of why $L$ is discrete, as my above proof cannot be used to prove this either.","The following definition of discreteness and uniform discreteness comes from Wikipedia.
