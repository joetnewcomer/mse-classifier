15,"$n$ points in the plane can be connected with $n-1$ clockwise, non-intersecting line segments from any starting point","points in the plane can be connected with  clockwise, non-intersecting line segments from any starting point",n n-1,"This conjecture is based on a mobile game that I've published. The object of the game is: Given $n ≥ 3$ points in the Cartesian plane in general position (no $3$ of those points are a straight line): Connect all the points with $n - 1$ line segments, drawn continuously (without lifting pencil from paper). Drawing lines in this way forms a permutation of the set of $n$ points, with each line segment being defined by the $n-1$ subsequences of $2$ consecutive points in that permutation. (No line segment is drawn between the first and last points in the permutation.) Every subsequence of $3$ consecutively connected points must be clockwise oriented in the order that they were connected. No two of the line segments may intersect. Equations that precisely define clockwise orientation and line intersection are provided under the ""Insights"" section of this post. I've already proven that every instance of this game is solvable if the player gets to choose the point at which they start: Start at a point on the convex hull of the set of points, then continue making connections in a clockwise spiral to minimize each successive angle between line segments until every point has been reached. Example solution: However, I conjecture that the game is also solvable by using any arbitrary point as the starting point, even if it's not on the convex hull of all the points. I have not yet manually created a counterexample to this conjecture, and I've also searched millions of possible levels using a computer program without finding a counterexample. However, I have yet to formally prove the conjecture. Clarification: Here's another wording of the problem: Given a set of $n ≥ 3$ points $\{P_1, P_2, ..., P_n\}$ in general position, and given an arbitrary point $Q$ from that set, does there always exist a permutation of that set satisfying the following conditions: The first element of the permutation is $Q$ None of the following line segments intersect with each other: $\overline{P_i P_{i+1}}$ for each $i \in [1, n-1]$ Referring to $P_i$ , $P_{i+1}$ , and $P_{i+2}$ as $(A_x, A_y)$ , $(B_x, B_y)$ , and $(C_x, C_y)$ for each $i \in [1, n-2]$ , the following condition is always satisfied: $\begin{vmatrix}(B_x - A_x)&(B_y - A_y)\\(C_x - A_x)&(C_y - A_y)\end{vmatrix}<0$ Alternative strategy: If an alternative conjecture can be proven where $Q$ is the last element of the permutation instead of the first element, then the original conjecture also holds. Reasoning: If the original conjecture holds for a set of points $S$ , then the alternative conjecture holds for $S'$ , where $S'$ has the points from $S$ reflected across a given arbitrary line (such as the y-axis). Insights: Whether two line segments intersect depends upon whether trios of their points are clockwise-oriented. This correspondence may be usable to generalize the problem, though I am not yet sure how. Let $c(A, B, C)$ be true iff A, B, and C are clockwise-oriented and false otherwise. Let $i(A, B, C, D)$ be true iff $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ intersect with each other and false otherwise. Then: $c(A, B, C) = (\begin{vmatrix}(B_x - A_x)&(B_y - A_y)\\(C_x - A_x)&(C_y - A_y)\end{vmatrix}<0)$ $i(A, B, C, D) = (c(A, B, C) \oplus c(A, B, D)) \land (c(C, D, A) \oplus c(C, D, B))$ The following identities hold on the function $c$ : $c(A, B, C) = c(B, C, A) = c(C, A, B)$ $c(A, B, C) \oplus c(C, B, A)$ always evaluates to true The function $f(N)$ that gives the number of sets of N points that are distinct (defined below) is given by A000930 , where $f(N)$ is the Nth element of that sequence. (Obviously, $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ are meaningless in the context of this problem.) For example, there is only one distinct set of $3$ points — they form a triangle. For $4$ points, there are $2$ distinct sets — one with a convex hull of 4 points and one with a single point within a convex hull of 3 other points. Distinctness for the purpose of this result is defined by: the number of times the convex hull of the set of points can be removed before no points remain (i.e. the number of nested convex hulls in the initial set of points), and the numbers of points on each of the nested convex hulls. I believe, but have not yet formally proven, that the solution for any set of points $S$ is generalizable to any other set of points $T$ if $S$ and $T$ are not distinct by the above definition. Insights from answers: Carlyle proved that for a set of points $S$ , a solution can always be found if the initial point is in $T$ or $U$ , where $T$ is the convex hull of $S$ , and $U$ is the convex hull of $(S - T)$ . It follows that a solution can be found for any initial point in a set of $6$ or fewer points. Insights from comments: Thank you so much to everyone who's left comments! Here is a summary of the ideas and insights derived from my and others' comments. There have been misconceptions about the meaning of ""clockwise"". This term is precisely defined in the ""clarification"" and ""insights"" sections of my question. Observe the manner in which the following set of points is connected according to the rules in the problem statement: https://i.sstatic.net/gOMgp.png . The above set of points does not generalize to all sets of points with 3 convex hulls within each other (e.g. 3 convex hulls inscribed within concentric circles). Why does this not generalize? Consider the case of 4 convex hulls inscribed within concentric circles. Here is the general solution (with an arbitrarily large number of points on each). Here is a specific case, with a different solution than the general case.

However, I have yet to formally prove the conjecture. Clarification: Here's another wording of the problem: Given a set of points in general position, and given an arbitrary point from that set, does there always exist a permutation of that set satisfying the following conditions: The first element of the permutation is None of the following line segments intersect with each other: for each Referring to , , and as , , and for each , the following condition is always satisfied: Alternative strategy: If an alternative conjecture can be proven where is the last element of the permutation instead of the first element, then the original conjecture also holds. Reasoning: If the original conjecture holds for a set of points , then the alternative conjecture holds for , where has the points from reflected across a given arbitrary line (such as the y-axis). Insights: Whether two line segments intersect depends upon whether trios of their points are clockwise-oriented. This correspondence may be usable to generalize the problem, though I am not yet sure how. Let be true iff A, B, and C are clockwise-oriented and false otherwise. Let be true iff and intersect with each other and false otherwise. Then: The following identities hold on the function : always evaluates to true The function that gives the number of sets of N points that are distinct (defined below) is given by A000930 , where is the Nth element of that sequence. (Obviously, and are meaningless in the context of this problem.) For example, there is only one distinct set of points — they form a triangle. For points, there are distinct sets — one with a convex hull of 4 points and one with a single point within a convex hull of 3 other points. Distinctness for the purpose of this result is defined by: the number of times the convex hull of the set of points can be removed before no points remain (i.e. the number of nested convex hulls in the initial set of points), and the numbers of points on each of the nested convex hulls. I believe, but have not yet formally proven, that the solution for any set of points is generalizable to any other set of points if and are not distinct by the above definition. Insights from answers: Carlyle proved that for a set of points , a solution can always be found if the initial point is in or , where is the convex hull of , and is the convex hull of . It follows that a solution can be found for any initial point in a set of or fewer points. Insights from comments: Thank you so much to everyone who's left comments! Here is a summary of the ideas and insights derived from my and others' comments. There have been misconceptions about the meaning of ""clockwise"". This term is precisely defined in the ""clarification"" and ""insights"" sections of my question. Observe the manner in which the following set of points is connected according to the rules in the problem statement: https://i.sstatic.net/gOMgp.png . The above set of points does not generalize to all sets of points with 3 convex hulls within each other (e.g. 3 convex hulls inscribed within concentric circles). Why does this not generalize? Consider the case of 4 convex hulls inscribed within concentric circles. Here is the general solution (with an arbitrarily large number of points on each). Here is a specific case, with a different solution than the general case.

A more picturesque way of putting it is that if one wants to travel from one point of a (spherical) globe to the antipodal point (say, from the North Pole to the South Pole) in a fixed direction, the path one would be taking on the globe would be a loxodrome. For a unit sphere, the loxodrome that cuts the meridians at an angle $\varphi\in\left(0,90^\circ\right]$ is given by $$\begin{align*}x&=\mathrm{sech}(t\cot\;\varphi)\cos\;t\\y&=\mathrm{sech}(t\cot\;\varphi)\sin\;t\\z&=\tanh(t\cot\;\varphi)\end{align*}$$ While playing around with loxodromes, I noted that for certain values of $\varphi$, one can orient two identical loxodromes such that they do not intersect (that is, one can position two ships such that if both take similar loxodromic paths, they can never collide). Here for instance are two loxodromes whose constant angle $\varphi$ is $60^\circ$, oriented such that they do not cross each other: On the other hand, for the (extreme!) case of $\varphi=90^{\circ}$, the two loxodromes degenerate to great circles, and it is well known that two great circles must always intersect (at two antipodal points). Less extreme, but seemingly difficult, would be the problem of positioning two 80° loxodromes such that they do not intersect: This brings me to my first question: 1) For what values of $\varphi$ does it become impossible to orient two loxodromes such that they do not cross each other? For simplicity, one can of course fix one of the two loxodromes to go from the North Pole to the South Pole, and try to orient the other loxodrome so that it does not cross the fixed loxodrome. That's the simpler version of my actual problem. Some experimentation seems to indicate that it is not possible to orient three loxodromes such that they do not cross each other. So... 2) Is it true that for all (admissible) values of $\varphi$, one cannot position three loxodromes such that none of them cross each other?

25,Quickest general strategy for village meeting,Quickest general strategy for village meeting,,"Here is a problem, which neither I nor my friends (very experienced in solving things like this) can't solve. But it was used for a competition several years ago and one guy solved it there, as far as I know. Unfortunately the solution (and the guy) is lost. You have a village. It is shaped as a square 1 by 1. The headman lives at the exact center of the square. Other houses are spread throughout the area of the village, and there is only one person per house. There are finite number of houses, they all have size 0 and everyone is aware of their placement. The headman needs to organise a meeting, which collects all villagers. To do this, he goes to some other house and tells about the meeting, then go to the another, etc. Each villager is of course is guaranteed to be found in his house; once informed, he can either participate in the gathering or go to the meeting place at the headman house. They all travel at the speed of 1 and it takes 0 time to inform someone, once you've reached his(-er) house. You need to find the minimum time $T_{\text{MinMax}}$ in which all villagers (including headman) can be collected at the centre of village, regardless of their number and initial placement. The answer should come together with proof, i.e. you need to: a) provide a strategy (who goes where) and prove that it will work for any village in time $t \le T_{\text{MinMax}}$ b) prove that for all other strategies there must a village, which will be ""collected"" in time $t \ge T_{\text{MinMax}}$. Can anyone here solve it? You can be sure, that $T_{\text{MinMax}} < \infty$. For example, the following strategy works in $T_{\text{Max}} < 3\sqrt{5}+3\sqrt{2}/2$: 1) The village area is divided into 4 square subareas 0.5 by 0.5. 2) The headman goes to a closest house in one subarea and assings its host to be a subheadman and asks him to do the same strategy in his subarea. 3) Then the headman goes to another, neighboring subarea and does the same. And repeats this with the rest of 2 subareas. 4) The headman comes back to the centre of village. 5) If some subarea has no houses inside the headman just skips it. Let's say that in the worst case scenario it will take time $X$. Then for subheadmen it will take time $X/2$. The first subheadman is assigned in at most $\sqrt{2}/2$ time, the next in $\sqrt{2}/2+\sqrt{5}/2$ and the last in $\sqrt{2}/2+3\sqrt{5}/2$. Then at time $\sqrt{2}/2+3\sqrt{5}/2+X/2$ the last subarea is collected it its center and in $\sqrt{2}/4$ time it can be at village center. Which means $X < \sqrt{2}/2+3\sqrt{5}/2+X/2+\sqrt{2}/4$. So $T_{Max} = X < 3\sqrt{5}+3\sqrt{2}/2$. It is easy to prove that $T_{\text{MinMax}} \ge 2+\sqrt{2}$ (consider a village with 4 houses in the corners), and I am almost sure that $T_{\text{MinMax}} = 2+\sqrt{2}$, it was the result of that guy from the competition.","Here is a problem, which neither I nor my friends (very experienced in solving things like this) can't solve.

The above problem has two methods. Pure geometry . A bit of angle chasing and standard results from circles help us arrive at the desired result - ∆MNP is equilateral. I'll put up a picture of the angle chasing part here (I hope someone edits it, and puts up a picture using GeoGebra or some similar software - I'm sorry I'm not good at editing) I joined BP and CN for angle chasing purposes. (Note that if M is the midpoint of arc BC, then the figure so formed is a star, with 8 equilateral triangles) This can be solved beautifully using complex numbers . The vertices of the ∆ can be assumed to be 1,W,W 2 on a unit circle centered at origin. We need to prove that the new equilateral triangle is essentially a rotation of the original one, about an axis passing through center of its circumcircle perpendicular to its plane.

38,"How many ""prime"" rectangle tilings are there?","How many ""prime"" rectangle tilings are there?",,"Given two tilings of a rectangle by other rectangles, say that they are equivalent if there is a bijection from the edges, vertices, and faces of the tilings which preserves inclusion.

53,How to simplify the calculations of reflecting a ray about an ellipse,How to simplify the calculations of reflecting a ray about an ellipse,,"I wrote the script that made these images several days ago, the segments each depict a ray of light, as the light hits the boundary of the ellipse, it is reflected by the ellipse according to the laws of reflection, and the reflected ray of light is again reflected by the ellipse, and the reflection of the reflection is again reflected by the ellipse... The light keeps bouncing back and forth, over and over again, until the light has been reflected certain number of times. Step by step on how I made these images. First, you make an ellipse. $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ The above equation describes the points on the ellipse, it is also the boundary of the ellipse. (Assume the ellipse is horizontal). Construct a right triangle from one semi-minor axis and one semi-major axis, let the acute angle adjacent to the semi-major axis be $\alpha$ , then the relationship between a, b and $\alpha$ can be written as: $b = a \cdot tan(\alpha)$ Rewrite the equation of the ellipse: $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2 \cdot tan(\alpha)^2} = 1$ Pick a random point inside the ellipse, for all points inside by the ellipse, simply use this equation: $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} <= 1$ Then the random point is given as: $(a \cdot cos(\alpha) \cdot m, b \cdot sin(\alpha) \cdot n)$ Where $\alpha$ is in range $[0, 2\pi]$ , and m, n are in range $[0, 1]$ . Then pick a random angle $\beta$ , to construct a line passes the chosen point at angle $\beta$ with the x-axis. I use the slope-intercept form of line equation ( $y = k \cdot x + c$ ): Let the chosen point be $(x_0, y_0)$ , then the equation of the incident ray is: $y = tan(\beta) \cdot x + y_0 - x_0 \cdot tan(\beta)$ But if $\beta$ is a multiple of $\frac{\pi} {2}$ things get complicated, because tan(0) = 0 and $tan(\frac{\pi} {2})$ is undefined. So I use $y = y_0$ if the line is parallel to x-axis and $x = x_0$ if the line is perpendicular to x-axis. Now to calculate the intersections between the incident ray and ellipse. If: $c^2 < a^2 \cdot k^2 + b^2$ Then there can be two intersections $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ . $$\begin{align} n_1 &= a^2 \cdot k^2 + b^2 \\ n_2 &= 2 \cdot a^2 \cdot k \cdot c \\ n_3 &= a^2 \cdot (c^2 - b^2) \\ n_4 &= \sqrt{(n_2^2 - 4 \cdot n_1 \cdot n_3)} \\ x_0 &= \frac{(-n_2 + n_4)} {(2 \cdot n_1)} \\ x_1 &= \frac{(-n_2 - n_4)} {(2 \cdot n_1)} \\ y_0 &= k \cdot x_0 + c \\ y_1 &= k \cdot x_1 + c \end{align}$$ For lines like $x = x_0$ and $y = y_0$ however: First set: If $abs(x_0) <= a$ $y_0 = \sqrt{b^2 - x_0^2 \cdot \frac{b^2} {a^2}}$ Intersections are $(x_0, +y_0)$ and $(x_0, -y_0)$ . Second set: If $abs(y_0) <= b$ $x_0 = \sqrt{a^2 - y_0^2 \cdot \frac{a^2} {b^2}}$ Intersections are $(+x_0, y_0)$ and $(-x_0, y_0)$ Then choose the intersection to do further calculations, for $\beta$ in range $[0, \frac{\pi} {2}]$ and $[\frac{3 \pi} {2}, 2 \pi]$ I choose the right intersection, else I choose the left one. Then I calculate the tangent of the ellipse at the intersection. For a point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the ellipse given by a, b, the slope k of the line tangent to the ellipse at that point must satisfy: $k = \frac{-x_0 \cdot b^2} {a^2 \cdot y_0}$ Then for almost all lines, the equation of the tangential line is: $y = k \cdot x + \frac{b^2} {y_0}$ But if arctan(k) is a multiple of $\frac{\pi} {2}$ the above relationship breaks down and I instead fall back to constant form. Then I calculate the normal (line perpendicular to that tangent passing through that intersection): $y = \frac{-x} {k} + y_0 - \frac{-x_0} {k}$ Where $(x_0, y_0)$ is the intersection, and k is the slope of the normal. But again the above relationship breaks down if the line is special. I won't show how I deal with exceptions here, I already have shown too many equations, you can see all the calculations in the code. Then I calculate the signed angle formed by the incident ray and the normal: Let $k_1$ be the slope of the incident ray, let $k_2$ be the slope of the normal: $$\begin{align} \alpha_1 &= atan(k_1) \\ \alpha_2 &= atan(k_2) \\ \alpha_\delta &= \alpha_2 - \alpha_1 \\ \alpha_\delta &= (\alpha_\delta + \pi) \bmod 2 \pi - \pi \end{align}$$ Again, the above doesn't work if either of these lines are special, other calculations are required. Then I calculate the reflected ray, simply by rotate the normal line about the intersection by $\alpha_\delta$ (assuming the previous calculations succeeded): $$\begin{align} \alpha_3 &= \alpha_2 + \alpha_\delta \\ y &= tan(\alpha_3) \cdot x + y_0 - tan(\alpha_3) \cdot x_0 \end{align}$$ Then I calculated the intersections between the reflected ray and the ellipse, there will be two intersections, this time the intersection needed is the other intersection from the current one. Then all above calculations are repeated recursively, until a certain number of iteration is reached. How to simplify all calculations involved, and calculate the reflected ray in as few steps as possible, including all the edge cases? I want it that way: given the coordinate of a point and an angle, calculate the intersection of the ray with the ellipse, and then calculate the tangent of the ellipse at that intersection, then calculate the reflected ray, all of these in as few steps as possible, using one set of equations without exceptions. Preferably the number of equations involved should be less than or equal to six.","I wrote the script that made these images several days ago, the segments each depict a ray of light, as the light hits the boundary of the ellipse, it is reflected by the ellipse according to the laws of reflection, and the reflected ray of light is again reflected by the ellipse, and the reflection of the reflection is again reflected by the ellipse... The light keeps bouncing back and forth, over and over again, until the light has been reflected certain number of times. Step by step on how I made these images. First, you make an ellipse. The above equation describes the points on the ellipse, it is also the boundary of the ellipse. (Assume the ellipse is horizontal). Construct a right triangle from one semi-minor axis and one semi-major axis, let the acute angle adjacent to the semi-major axis be , then the relationship between a, b and can be written as: Rewrite the equation of the ellipse: Pick a random point inside the ellipse, for all points inside by the ellipse, simply use this equation: Then the random point is given as: Where is in range , and m, n are in range . Then pick a random angle , to construct a line passes the chosen point at angle with the x-axis. I use the slope-intercept form of line equation ( ): Let the chosen point be , then the equation of the incident ray is: But if is a multiple of things get complicated, because tan(0) = 0 and is undefined. So I use if the line is parallel to x-axis and if the line is perpendicular to x-axis. Now to calculate the intersections between the incident ray and ellipse. If: Then there can be two intersections and . For lines like and however: First set: If Intersections are and . Second set: If Intersections are and Then choose the intersection to do further calculations, for in range and I choose the right intersection, else I choose the left one.

I have been thinking about this problem for some time when in the kitchen without making any real progress: How does one cut onions in a mathematically efficient way? For simplicity, let's assume that an onion is perfectly spherical with radius $r$, consisting of $n$ layers of thickness $d = \frac{r}{n}$. Each cut consists of a plane $p_i$ orthogonal to the $xy$-plane (the cutting board) intersecting some (or all) parts of the onion, arranged in some way, dividing them. The goal is to, with a sequence of cuts $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$, get the onion to consist of a set of pieces (most likely irregular in shape) so that they all have diameter at most $M$. By diameter of a piece, we mean the longest possible distance between two points on the piece. How should the cuts $p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$ of the onion be made so that this criterion is fulfilled (all the pieces are small enough) and $N$ is as small as possible? In other words, we don't consider time to be an issue, just the smallest number of cuts. You may rearrange the pieces in any which way between cuts as long as you specify which part goes where. I think it's fair to assume $d < M$, because otherwise the pieces need to be very small and one would just use a blender. Of course, the model isn't perfect , since we have an infinitely long knife on an infinitely large cutting board, but since I never seem to run out of room on it, I think that's OK. Yes, this question is just as ""serious"" as it sounds, but I would very much appreciate your thoughts on this. I welcome everything from ideas on how to approach the problem and sketches of an optimal strategy (I'm a Master student in computational science) to a full-blown perfect algorithm.

The problem goes as follow : in a barn, there is a 1 meter cubic box against a wall and a 4 meter ladder is leaning against the wall, touching the box at its corner. Here is a picture : So, the big triangle has a hypotenuse $FE$ of $4$, the square $ABDC$ has sides of length 1 and is basically ""insquared"" at the right angle, i.e. $D\in \overline{FE}$. The question is ""what is the length of the biggest cathetus"", here $AF$. So far, no problem. Now here are my solutions: By Thales' intercept theorem, $\frac{FB}{FA}=\frac{BD}{AE}$, by hypothesis, $FB=FA-1$ and $BD=1$. Now by Pythagoras, $FA^2+AE^2=FE^2$; by hypothesis, $FE=4$, so we end up with a system of equations, letting $h=FA, d=AE$: $$ \begin{align} &\frac{h-1}{h}=\frac{1}{d} \\ &h^2+d^2=4^2  \end{align} $$ Which solves (removing 3 non-relevant solutions) into $d \cong 1.3622$ and $h \cong 3.76091$. Now, if I consider the ""function"" of the line : $f(x)=\frac{-h}{d}x+h$, I know that $f(1)=1$ and I end up with Pythagoras with the system :$$ \begin{align} &\frac{-h}{d}+h=1 \\ &h^2+d^2=4^2  \end{align} $$ it solves again into the same, again removing 3 non-relevant solutions Okay, this means that using Pythagoras is no good since it ends up giving a quartic equation (4 answers of which 3 are ""non-relevant""). Now if I consider the length of the arc $f(x)$ between $0$ and $d$ it has to be $4$ and again $f(1)=1$ I end up with the system: $$ \begin{align} &\frac{-h}{d}+h=1 \\ &\int_0^d \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} dx =\int_0^d \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{-h}{d}\right)^2} dx = d \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{-h}{d}\right)^2}   \end{align} $$ Which solves again into the same answers, but this time removing only 2 non-relevant solutions (i.e. it gives a cubic equation instead of a quartic). I tried also using the areas and the smaller trangles $FAD$ and $AED$ for example : $\frac{h \cdot d}{2} = \frac{h\cdot 1}{2}+\frac{d\cdot 1}{2}$ Yet I wasn't able to get to any ""hand solvable"" solution : if I were able to bring it down to some quadratic equation, that would be nice, since it is a common assumption, here, that everybody has seen the ""general formula for solving quadratic equations"" in school and so would be able to solve this, I may then see how it is seen as a funny riddle in the newspaper. My best trial, with ""just"" a cubic equation, is way too complicated for the normal readers of this newspaper, so it's bugging me. What am I missing? Some basic properties maybe?

Problem 262: Prove that the middle perpendiculars [i.e., the perpendicular bisectors] to the line segments joining the intersection points of the altitudes [i.e., the orthocentres] to the centres of the circumscribed circles of the four triangles formed by four arbitrary straight lines in the plane intersect at one point ( Herwey’s point ). Точка Эрвея Problem 282: An arc $AB$ of a circle is divided into three equal parts by the points $C$ and $D$ ($C$ is nearest to $A$). When rotated about the point $A$ through an angle of $\pi/3$, the points $B$, $C$ and $D$ go into points $B_1$, $C_1$ and $D_1$; $F$ is the point of intersection of the straight lines $AB_1$ and $DC_1$; $E$ is a point on the bisector of the angle $B_1 B A$ such that $|BD| = |DE|$.

88,A geometric reason why the square of the focal length of a hyperbola is equal to the sum of the squares of the axes?,A geometric reason why the square of the focal length of a hyperbola is equal to the sum of the squares of the axes?,,"When I teach conics, I give a simple geometric argument for the Pythagorean relation for ellipses. (By ""Pythagorean relation"" I mean the fact that the square of the focal length $c$ is the difference of the squares of the semimajor and semiminor axes, i.e. $c^2=|a^2-b^2|$ for the ellipse defined by $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$.) The picture argument goes as follows: just draw the obvious isosceles triangle from the two foci to one of the two points at the end of the minor axis. We see two right triangles; in each, one leg is the focal length $c$ and the other leg is the semiminor axis, while the hypotenuse is the semimajor axis. The result follows from the Pythagorean theorem applied to this right triangle. But when it comes to the Pythagorean relation for hyperbolas, I can't think of an equally convincing picture to draw. Instead I have to give a rather inelegant algebraic argument for the relation $c^2=a^2+b^2$ (for the hyperbola defined by $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, with focal length $c$), directly from the definition of the hyperbola. The messy details are below.* Now, obviously there is an asymmetry between the argument for the ellipse and the argument for the hyperbola: the ellipse argument is almost trivial and doesn't involve working straight from the locus definition, but the hyperbola argument is tedious and does require working straight from the definition. So, my question: Is there an equally persuasive picture I could draw to convince high   school students of the Pythagorean relation for hyperbolas -- without having to get technical with points at infinity, say? The natural triangle to draw is the right triangle with legs from the center to a vertex and from that vertex to an asymptote, which has legs of length $a$ and $b$; but then the problem becomes why the length along the asymptote should be equal to $c$. I doubt there is a purely (Euclidean) geometrical reason because this triangle lies on the asymptote, not on the hyperbola itself; I suspect some sort of limiting procedure will be required. [*] The tedious algebraic details: The foci lie at $(\pm c,0)$.   Say $a>b$. Then hyperbola is the locus of points $(x,y)$ such that $$\left|\sqrt{(x+c)^2+y^2}-\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}\right|=2a$$ Assume for simplicity the expression between the absolute value bars   is positive. (The algebra is even more tedious if we don't make such a   simplifying assumption.) Then moving the right root to the other side   and squaring gives $$(x+c)^2+y^2=4a^2+(x-c)^2+y^2+4a\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}$$ Simplifying gives $$xc-a^2=a\sqrt{(x-c)^2+y^2}$$ and upon squaring again we have $$x^2c^2-2xca^2+a^4=a^2(x^2-2xc+c^2+y^2)=a^2x^2-2xca^2+c^2a^2+a^2y^2$$ which reduces to $$x^2(c^2-a^2)-y^2a^2=a^2(c^2-a^2)$$ Defining $b^2:=c^2-a^2$ brings the equation into the form   $x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1$, and the Pythagorean relation follows from the   definition of $b$.","When I teach conics, I give a simple geometric argument for the Pythagorean relation for ellipses.

For example, imagine a cylinder that you curve into the shape of the letter $C$. The body that you get isn't convex, but if you imagine how it's silhouette would look you could completely describe it. Ok, so to give another point of view and hopefully better describe what I mean, imagine this. You have a block of clay. In front of the clay is a surface. On the surface, there's a projection of the body under some rotation. What you do is, from the current point of view, cut out all the clay that's ""not in the silhouette"", cookie cutter style.

How should we arrange the surrounding circles, in order to minimize the middle circle's radius $R$ ? Take $n=10$ for example. On the left, going anticlockwise the radii are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10$ , and $R\approx 10.77$ . On the right, going anticlockwise the radii are $10, 2, 9, 4, 7, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3$ and $R\approx 9.98$ . How should the circles be arranged to minimize $R$ ? Here is a desmos graph where you can try different arrangements for the case $n=10$ . My attempt For general $n$ , call the radii of the surrounding circles going anti-clockwise, $r_1, r_2, r_3, ..., r_n$ . Draw line segments from the centre of the middle circle to the centre of each surrounding circle. So we have $n$ angles at the centre of the middle circle. Each of these angles can be expressed in terms of $R, r_k, r_{k+1}$ , using the law of cosines . The sum of the $n$ angles is $2π$ . So we have: $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \arccos{\left(\frac{(R+r_k)^2+(R+r_{k+1})^2-(r_k+r_{k+1})^2}{2(R+r_k)(R+r_{k+1})}\right)}=2\pi \text{ (where }r_{n+1}=r_1)$$ This simplifies to: $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \arccos{\left(1-\frac{2r_k r_{k+1}}{(R+r_k)(R+r_{k+1})}\right)}=2\pi$$ We want to assign each $r$ a unique value among $1, 2, 3, ..., n$ so that $R$ is minimized. But how? Is there a general pattern? Conjectured answer I think the following general procedure will make the middle circle as small as possible. Take $n=10$ for example. We ignore the $1$ at first; it will be placed last. First put down the numbers $10, 9, 8, 7, 6$ in pyramid-fashion, from top to down and from left to right, like the red numbers below. Then put down the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5$ in pyramid-fashion also, but between the previous rows, like the blue numbers below. This gives the order of radii going around the circle: $7, 4, 9, 2, 10, 3, 8, 5, 6$ . Then put the circle with radius $1$ anywhere you like, as long as it fits without disturbing other circles. For larger values of $n$ , there may be multiple small circles that can fit between other circles without disturbing them. Put those last. Intuitively, this procedure minimizes the tendency of the large surrounding circles to take up space around the middle circle. You can see this in the diagrams above with $n=10$ , looking specifically at the two largest surrounding circles in each case. Anyway, it's just a conjecture for now. Notice that this conjecture implies that, for $n=10$ , the arrangement I showed above on the right, yields the minimum radius of the middle circle.

97,Is it possible to explain geometrically why $\arctan (1/2) +\arctan (1/3) = 45$ degrees?,Is it possible to explain geometrically why  degrees?,\arctan (1/2) +\arctan (1/3) = 45,"$\arctan(1/2)$ seems to be some strange, irrational angle, and the same goes for $\arctan(1/3)$ , but those two angles seem to sum up to $45$ degrees. This seems like a mystery to me even though I can derive the result algebraically as follows, by using the summation formula for the tangent function. $\tan\big(\arctan(1/2)+\arctan (1/3)\big)=\dfrac{5/6}{1 - 1/6}=1\,.$ Can someone come up with a geometric explanation?

98,What is the flaw in this proof that all triangles are isosceles?,What is the flaw in this proof that all triangles are isosceles?,,"What is the flaw in this ""proof"" that all triangles are isosceles? From the linked page: One well-known illustration of the logical fallacies to which Euclid's methods are vulnerable (or at least would be vulnerable if we didn't ""cheat"" by allowing ourselves to be guided by accurately drawn figures) is the ""proof"" that all triangles are isosceles. Given an arbitrary triangle ABC, draw the angle bisector of the interior angle at A, and draw the perpendicular bisector of segment BC at D, as shown below: If the angle bisector at A and the perpendicular bisector of BC are parallel, then ABC is isosceles. On the other hand, if they are not parallel, they intersect at a point, which we call P, and we can draw the perpendiculars from P to AB at E, and to AC at F. Now, the two triangles labeled ""alpha"" in this figure have equal angles and share a common side, so they are totally equal. Therefore, PE = PF. Also, since D is the midpoint of BC, it's clear that the triangles labeled ""gamma"" are equal right triangles, and so PB = PC. From this it follows that the triangles labeled ""beta"" are similar and equal to each other, so we have BE+EA = CF+FA, meaning the triangle ABC is isosceles. All theorems from Euclidean geometry used in the argument are correct. I know this statement is false but I was wondering if anyone knew what the problem was. I'm very confused about solving this question.","What is the flaw in this ""proof"" that all triangles are isosceles?

99,Do ellipsoids cast ellipsoidal shadows?,Do ellipsoids cast ellipsoidal shadows?,,"Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , is any orthogonal projection of it to a subspace also an ellipsoid? Here, an ellipsoid is defined as $$\Delta_{A, c}=\{x\in \Bbb R^n\,:\, x^TAx\le c\}$$ where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite n by n matrix, and $c > 0$ . I'm just thinking about this because it gives a nice visual way to think about least-norm regression. I note that SVD proves immediately that any linear image (not just an orthogonal projection) of an ellipsoid is also an ellipsoid, however there might be a more geometrically clever proof when the linear map is an orthogonal projection.","Given an n-dimensional ellipsoid in , is any orthogonal projection of it to a subspace also an ellipsoid?
