Let X be a random variable who's value is the number of BLUE balls  with a RED ball on either side of it.     A. Find E[X]     B.

The problem is: We have $n(n+1)/2$ stones in $k$ piles.

Show that regardless of the initial configuration, we always end up with n piles, having $1, 2, 3, \dots, n$ stones each.

Then, because for each number of stones (not necessary of the form $n(n+1)/2$ ) the number of possible configurations is finite we will always end up in a cycle that will repeat itself forever. I noticed from the Python script i wrote that for each initial number of stones regardless of the initial configuration we always end up in the same cycle and i wanted to prove it by induction thus completing the proof, with the induction base: for $p = 1$ stones we only have one cycle $1\to 1 \to 1\to \dots$ and the induction step: if $p > 1$ has more then one different cycle then p-1 has more then one different cycle too. If we don’t have a pile with only one stone for any combination in our cycle then we can just remove a stone from the pile with the maximum amount of stones for every configuration of the cycle thus giving us a cycle for $p-1$ stones.

My ""Solution"": I started by noticing that if we denote our transformation from one configuration of stones to the other than has only one solution . Then, because for each number of stones (not necessary of the form ) the number of possible configurations is finite we will always end up in a cycle that will repeat itself forever. I noticed from the Python script i wrote that for each initial number of stones regardless of the initial configuration we always end up in the same cycle and i wanted to prove it by induction thus completing the proof, with the induction base: for stones we only have one cycle and the induction step: if has more then one different cycle then p-1 has more then one different cycle too. If we don’t have a pile with only one stone for any combination in our cycle then we can just remove a stone from the pile with the maximum amount of stones for every configuration of the cycle thus giving us a cycle for stones. I’m stuck on the case when we have a pile with only one stone in a configuration of the cycle. Is there a simpler solution? Is there some core idea that i didn’t notice? can my proof be completed? I would greatly appreciate any help.","n(n+1)/2 k 1, 2, 3, \dots, n f(x) = y f(x) = x x = 1, 2, 3, \dots, n n(n+1)/2 p = 1 1\to 1 \to 1\to \dots p > 1 p-1","['combinatorics', 'induction', 'contest-math']"

How many $k$ -letter words of this alphabet are there such that two certain letters (say A and B) are not next to each other? A word may contain the same letter multiple times. My thoughts: There are $n^k$ words with length $k$ over the alphabet. We need to find and subtract away the number of words where A and B are next to each other. I modeled any such word as one with the string AB or BA at an index $i$ : $$x_1x_2x_3\cdots x_{i-1}ABx_{i+2}\cdots x_k$$ The $x_j$ here are all letters of the alphabet. We can think of the above word as an $(i-1)$ -letter word, followed by AB, followed by a $(k-i-2)$ -letter word. Thus, there are $n^i \cdot n^{k-i-2} = n^{k-2}$ words where AB or BA is at an arbitrary index $i$ .
