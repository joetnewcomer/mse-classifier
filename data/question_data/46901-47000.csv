I know that a lot of users on this site (e.g. Cleo, Jack D'Aurizio, and so on) are really good at figuring out crafty ways of solving recreational definite integrals, like $$\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \frac{x\sin(x)}{5-4\cos(x)} \, dx$$ or $$\int_0^\infty \bigg(\frac{x-1}{\ln^2(x)}-\frac{1}{\ln(x)}\bigg)\frac{dx}{x^2+1}$$ When questions like this pop up on MSE, the OP provides an integral to evaluate, and the answerers can evaluate it using awesome tricks including (but certainly not limited to): Clever substitution Exploitation of symmetry in the integrand Integration by parts Expanding the integrand as a series Differentiating a well-know integral-defined function, like the Gamma or Beta functions Taking Laplace and Inverse Laplace transforms But when I play around with integrals on my own, I don't always have a particular problem to work on.

Cheers!","I begin this post with a plea: please don't be too harsh with this post for being off topic or vague. It's a question about something I find myself doing as a mathematician, and wonder whether others do it as well. It is a soft question about recreational mathematics - in reality, I'm shooting for more of a conversation. I know that a lot of users on this site (e.g. Cleo, Jack D'Aurizio, and so on) are really good at figuring out crafty ways of solving recreational definite integrals, like $$\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} \frac{x\sin(x)}{5-4\cos(x)} \, dx$$ or $$\int_0^\infty \bigg(\frac{x-1}{\ln^2(x)}-\frac{1}{\ln(x)}\bigg)\frac{dx}{x^2+1}$$ When questions like this pop up on MSE, the OP provides an integral to evaluate, and the answerers can evaluate it using awesome tricks including (but certainly not limited to): Clever substitution Exploitation of symmetry in the integrand Integration by parts Expanding the integrand as a series Differentiating a well-know integral-defined function, like the Gamma or Beta functions Taking Laplace and Inverse Laplace transforms But when I play around with integrals on my own, I don't always have a particular problem to work on. Instead, I start with a known integral, like $$\int_0^\pi \cos(mx)\cos(nx) \, dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\delta_{mn},\space\space \forall m,n\in \mathbb Z^+$$ and ""milk"" it, for lack of a better word, to see how many other obscure, rare, or aesthetically pleasing integrals I can derive from it using some of the above techniques.

37,Is this continuous analogue to the AM–GM inequality true?,Is this continuous analogue to the AM–GM inequality true?,,"First let us remind ourselves of the statement of the AM–GM inequality: Theorem: ( AM–GM Inequality ) For any sequence $(x_n)$ of $N\geqslant 1$ non-negative real numbers, we have $$\frac1N\sum_k x_k \geqslant \left(\prod_k x_k\right)^{\frac1N}$$ It is well known that the sum operator ∑ can be generalised so that it operates on continuous functions rather than on discrete sequences. This generalisation is the integral operator ∫. Likewise, we can generalise the product operator to operate on continuous functions. We begin with the following property of the discrete product: $$\log\prod_k A_k=\sum_k \log A_k$$ (assuming that $A_k>0$). Using this we can define the continuous product (also known as the geometric integral according to Wikipedia ) as follows: $$\prod_a^b f(x)\ dx := \exp\int_a^b\log f(x)\ dx.$$ assuming that the integral converges. From these definitions we can seek to generalise the AM–GM inequality to continuous functions: Proposition: ( Continuous AM–GM Inequality ) For any suitably well-behaved non-negative function $f$ defined on $[a,b]$ with $a<b$, we have: $$\frac1{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)\ dx \geqslant \left(\prod_a^b f(x)\ dx\right)^\frac1{b-a}$$ or in traditional notation: $$\frac1{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)\ dx \geqslant \exp\left(\frac1{b-a} \int_a^b \log f(x)\ dx\right)$$ As a simple illustration, consider the function $f(x)=1+\sin x$ and fix the lower bound $a=0$. On the following graph the $x$-axis represents the upper bound of integration $b$, and on the $y$-axis are represented the the arithmetic mean (blue) and the geometric mean (red) of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$ where $a=0$ and $b=x$. Clearly the claimed inequality seems to hold, and is in fact quite tight when $b\approx0$. This inequality is of interest not least because it is readily abe to produce a number of non-trivial numerical inequalities pertaining to known constants. For instance, again with the example $f(x)=1+\sin x$, set $b=\pi/2$. Then assuming the proposition holds, we have $$\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi/2} 1 + \sin x\ dx \geqslant \exp \left( \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \log(1+\sin x)\ dx \right)$$ Evaluating these integrals and rearranging, we obtain: $$G \leqslant \frac\pi4\log\left(2+\frac2\pi\right) \approx 0.9313$$ where $G\approx 0.9159$ is Catalan's constant. Anyway I would like to ask, firstly: Is the claimed inequality true, and if so what is the proof and on what class of functions is it applicable?

In this question, I will use things that I know from Calculus, but I emphasize that I have not taken the course, so please bear with me. This will be long. Among other Geometric formulas that I have learned recently, I am currently trying to prove that the surface area of a sphere is $4\pi r^2$. Intuitively, this seems fairly straightforward for me, since I have already proven the volume of a sphere using integration to be $\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$, and that the integral of the circumference of a circle is its area. Using these two facts together, it makes sense that the integral of the surface area of a sphere should be its volume, leading me to believe the formula for surface area stated above. However, this is a very weak argument, since I make the connection between circumference to area and area to volume without much proof. As an alternative, I made a proof involving infinite sums of the lateral areas of cylinders squeezed into a sphere. One can use this method of infinite cylinders to prove the volume of a sphere, but when I tried almost the exact same thing for surface area, I found that the value of pi is 4 . I have only heard of one other strange proof that leads to this result, and it can be found here: Is value of $\pi = 4$ . It was promptly disproved in numerous ways, some of them here: How to convince a layman that the π=4 proof is wrong? As far as I know, there's nothing wrong with my math -- I most likely simply set up the problem incorrectly. Here's what I did: Consider a sphere of radius $r$, aligned with the coordinate plane in a way that its center is the origin. To approximate the surface area (or volume) of this sphere, we can imagine fitting $n$ stacked cylinders into it, each with a center on the line $x = 0$. Each cylinder has a height $h$, or $\Delta y$. Since the height of the sphere is $2r$, $h = \frac{2r}{n}$ Looking at a cross-section of this sphere, the radius of each cylinder must satisfy the equation: $r_i^2 + y^2 = r^2$ where $r_i$ is the radius of the cylinder with index $i$, and the radius of the sphere is $r$. Now, we sum the lateral areas of the cylinders to get an approximation for the surface area of the sphere. As $n \rightarrow \infty$, our approximation gets better, so $A = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sum_{i=1}^n{2\pi r_i (\frac{2r}{n})}} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\sum_{i=1}^n{2\pi r_i \Delta y}}$ In other words: $\int_{-r}^r{2\pi r_i   dy}$ And as we already know, $r_i = \sqrt{r^2-y_i^2}$ So we substitute and take out constants: $2\pi \int_{-r}^r{\sqrt{r^2-y^2} dy}$ From here, we have two options: 1) Take the integral and find something very messy; 2) Recognize that the expression inside the integral is just a semicircle, and that a semicircle has half the area of a circle. Choosing option 2), I end up with: $2\pi \frac{\pi r^2}{2} = \pi^2 r^2$ Which is clearly not the surface area of a sphere, but I can't figure out why. Strangely, another ""proof"" I did also led to this result. Take the semicircle $y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ with arclength $\pi r$ and rotate it about the x axis $2\pi$ radians. We now have a sphere, with surface area $2\pi^2 r^2$. Something is clearly wrong here, but it gets stranger.

I'm not looking for a better proof or someone to convince me that Archimedes is right, as I fully accept the textbook formula and have used other proofs to show it.

69,How to change variables in a surface integral without parametrizing,How to change variables in a surface integral without parametrizing,,"This is a doubt that I carry since my PDE classes. Some background (skippable): In the multivariable calculus course at my university we made all sorts of standard calculations involving surface and volume integrals in $R^3$ , jacobians and the generalizations of the fundamental theorem of calculus. In order to make those calculations we had to parametrize domains and calculate differentials. A couple of years later I took a PDE course. We worked with Evans' Partial differential equations book. This was my first experience with calculus in $\mathbb R^n$ and manipulations like $$\text{average}\int_{B(x,r)}f(y)\,dy= \text{average}\int_{B(0,1)}f(x+rz)\,dz.$$ This was an ordinary change of variables. $y=x+rz,\,\,dy=r^n\,dz$ and the mystery was solved. Like in that case, I was able to justify most of these formal manipulations after disentangling definitions. That aside, I found these quick formal calculations to be very powerful. However, I realized that I wasn't able to justify this: $$\text{average} \int_{\partial B(x,r)}f(y)dS(y)= \text{average}\int_{\partial B(0,1)}f(x+rz)\,dS(z).$$ I have some vague idea of what's happening: the same substitution as before, but this time the jacobian is $r^{n-1}$ because the transformation is actually happening between regions which ""lack one dimension"". Also, I see some kind of pattern: a piece of arc-length in the plane is $r\,d\theta$ , a piece of sphere-area is $r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \,d\theta$ , ""and so on"". Maybe some measure-theoretic argument can help me: I know, roughly speaking, that for any measure $\mu$ , $$\int_\Omega f\circ \phi \,d\mu=\int_{\phi(\Omega)} f \, d(\mu\circ\phi^{-1}).$$ I'd say $\phi(z)=(z-x)/r$ and $\phi^{-1}(y)=ry+x$ , but I actually don't know how $dS(y)$ looks like ""as a measure"" (It's not a product measure or a restriction of one, but it somehow relates to Lebesgue's in $\mathbb R^n$ ...). Why would I conclude that $dS(y)\circ \phi^{-1}=r^{n-1}dS(z)$ ? I have an intuition, but either I lack the mathematical concepts and definitions to express it or I'm just too confused. Is there some theory that I could learn in order to understand? Maybe something about the measure $dS$ . Is it expressible in terms of the Lebesgue measure in some way? Or set-theoretically, maybe, without having to resort to $n-1$ parameters and complicated relations? Maybe all of this would not have been a problem if I had ever mastered n-dimensional spherical coordinates. But even so, more generally, is there a way of changing variables when I'm integrating over a subregion of ""dimension $<n$ "" without necessarily parametrizing ? Sorry for the vagueness, but I don't really know what to ask for exactly. Note: I saw some of the answers to this post , but none of them were deep enough in the direction I intend. Note II: If there are no general methods or theories, maybe restricting to linear transformations, to Lebesgue measure exclusively, or to subregions defined by simple expressions like $g(x)=C$ or $g(|x|)=C$ could get me somewhere.

80,Why does Monte-Carlo integration work better than naive numerical integration in high dimensions?,Why does Monte-Carlo integration work better than naive numerical integration in high dimensions?,,"Can anyone explain simply why Monte-Carlo works better than naive Riemann integration in high dimensions? I do not understand how chosing randomly the points on which you evaluate the function can yield a more precise result than distributing these points evenly on the domain. More precisely: Let $f:[0,1]^d \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous bounded integrable function, with $d\geq3$. I want to compute $A=\int_{[0,1]^d} f(x)dx$ using $n$ points. Compare 2 simple methods. The first method is the Riemann approach. Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be $n$ regularly spaced points in $[0,1]^d$ and $A_r=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)$. I have that $A_r \to A$ as $n\to\infty$. The error will be of order $O(\frac{1}{n^{1/d}})$. The second method is the Monte-Carlo approach. Let $u_1, \dots, u_n$ be $n$ points chosen randomly but uniformly over $[0,1]^d$. Let $A_{mc}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(u_i)$. The central limit theorem tells me that $A_{mc} \to A$ as $n\to \infty$ and that $A_{mc}-A$ will be in the limit a gaussian random variable centered on $0$ with variance $O(\frac{1}{n})$. So with a high probability the error will be smaller than $\frac{C}{\sqrt{n}}$ where $C$ does not depend (much?) on $d$. An obvious problem with the Riemann approach is that if I want to increase the number of points while keeping a regular grid I have to go from $n=k^d$ to $n=(k+1)^d$ which adds a lots of points. I do not have this problem with Monte-Carlo. But if the number of points is fixed at $n$, does Monte-Carlo really yield better results than Riemann? It seems true in most cases.

But I have a real question, too, which I will ask at the end of this post, so please stay tuned. Consider the unit circle $C_1$ in $\mathbb{C}$ with $n$ equally distributed numbers $z_k = e^{i2\pi k/n}$ . Draw from each $z_k$ an arrow to $z_k + f(z_k)$ for $f(z) = z$ resp. $f(z) = 1/z$ . To make the connection between $z$ and $1/z$ more comprehensible I plot the graphs $f_p(z) = pz + (1-p)/z$ for some values of $0 \leq p \leq 1$ . Note that $f_1(z) = z$ and $f_0(z) = 1/z$ . [click image to enlarge] Note that these plots are essentially stream plots a) restricted to the unit circle and b) displaying not only the direction of the vector field but also its magnitude. Note that by $f_p(-z) = -f_p(z)$ we have $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f_p(z_k) = 0$ for all $p$ which can more easily be seen when drawing $f_p(z)$ from the origin: Note the difference in color between $f_1(z) = z$ and $f_0(z) = 1/z$ which is due to different phases $\varphi = 2\pi k/n$ of the arguments. Now let's consider the factor $d_nz$ , which is the secant (for $n\rightarrow \infty$ the tangent) vector of the circle at point $z$ . Multiplying $f(z)$ by $d_nz$ shrinks and rotates $f(z)$ . Because $|d_nz|\rightarrow 0$ for $n\rightarrow\infty$ , we would have $|f(z)d_nz| \rightarrow 0$ , too, so to keep the vector $f(z)d_nz$ visible, we normalize $d_nz$ by division by $|d_nz| = 2\pi/n$ . So, only the rotation of $f(z)$ is in the focus: Now we are already done: For $f(z) = f_1(z) = z$ the vectors $f(z_k)dz$ still sum up to $0$ , while for $f(z) = f_0(z) = 1/z$ we have $n$ vectors of length $1$ all pointing into the same direction (up), so there sum is just $n\cdot i$ . Multiplying by the normalization factor $2\pi/n$ we get the desired result: $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f_0(z_k)d_nz = 2\pi i$$ which holds for arbitrary $n$ . Put algebraically, one finds with $\zeta_k = e^{i2\pi k/n}$ the $n$ -th roots of unity, $d_k = \zeta_k e^{i\pi / 2}$ , and $1/\zeta_k = \overline{\zeta_k}$ : $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_k d_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_k^2 e^{i\pi / 2} = i \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_k^2 = i \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\zeta_k = 0$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\overline{\zeta_k} d_k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\overline{\zeta_k}\zeta_k e^{i\pi / 2} = i \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1 = i \cdot n$$ Again, to see this more clearly, we can draw $f(z)d_nz$ from the origin: Note that the single point for $p=0$ , i.e. $f_0(z) = 1/z$ , represents in fact $n$ points, all at the same position. The proof sketched here was somehow ""synthetic"" or geometrical. It's interesting to compare it with the analytic proof: $$\oint_{C_1} dz/z = \int _0 ^{2 \pi} \dfrac{i e^{i z}}{e^{i z}} dz = \int _0 ^{2 \pi}i dz = 2 \pi i $$ and the proof by Cauchy's residue theorem $$\oint_{C_1} dz/z = 2\pi i \operatorname{I}(C_1,0)\operatorname{Res}(1/z,0)= 2 \pi i$$ with $\operatorname{I}(C_1,0) = 1$ the winding number of $C_1$ around $0$ and $\operatorname{Res}(1/z,0) = 1$ the residue of $f(z)=1/z$ at $0$ . What I don't see in the pictures above is, what the value of the integral has to do with the existence of a pole at $0$ , so my question is: By which kind of ""long-range interaction"" does the singularity at $0$ ""force"" the vectors $dz/z$ to rotate exactly the way   they do, summing up to $2\pi i$ ? Addendum 2 Dirk asked for pictures for $f(z) = 1/z^2$ . Here they are for $z \rightarrow z + f(z)$ , $z \rightarrow z + f(z)d_nz$ , , $0 \rightarrow f(z)d_nz$ : For the sake of comparison here are the plots for $f(z) = z^k$ , $k = 1,2,3,4$ (upper rows) and $f(z) = 1/z^k$ (lower rows): Note the special character of the bottom left plot in the second picture which is the one that relates to the residue of $z^{-1}$ at $z=0$ being $1$ . All other residues of $z^{\pm k}$ at $z=0$ are $0$ . Note also how derivation acts as rotation. Addendum 1 For the sake of comparison: The same visual proof works – even though not so easy to see at a glance – for other closed curves, e.g. a cardioid $\gamma$ . In the first table you'll see $z \rightarrow z + f(z)$ , in the second $z \rightarrow z + f(z)d_nz$ , in the third $0 \rightarrow f(z)d_nz$ .

Of course, I did not derive this directly, so I have no hard proof. 2) Asymptotically, the integrand behaves as $$\frac{\sin{(r-1) u}}{\sqrt{r} u} e^{-t u^2}$$ This is very interesting, and somewhat expected.  While this is a solution in a 2D, radially-symmetric geometry, the solution of the analogous problem in 1D has an integrand of the form $(\sin{(x u)}/u)\, e^{-t u^2}$. 3) The integral produces a function resembling an error function. Anyway, any analytical evaluation of the integral that results in a faster evaluation of the result than my using numerical integration will get my appreciation.",,"['integration', 'special-functions', 'error-function']"

93,Integral $\int_1^\infty\frac{dx}{1+2^x+3^x}$,Integral,\int_1^\infty\frac{dx}{1+2^x+3^x},"Can the integral $$\int_1^\infty\dfrac{dx}{1+2^x+3^x}$$ be given in closed form? This question arises naturally when I considered doing integrals. What makes an integral hard? Well, the integrand, of course. So why is it hard to integrate some integrands? For starters, I need to say that there are definite and indefinite integrals and that might affect the difficulty of the integral, but in both cases the situation seems the same. Let's say $f(x)$ is the (elementary) integrand. For starters, consider short expressions for $f(x)$. That makes sense, because logically long expressions are harder to integrate on average. So, we consider elementary functions $f(x)$ with a short expression. If $f(x)$ is mainly a product of simple functions, in other words, if $f(x)$ contains more products then sums then by using integration by parts it is clear that the integral of $f(x)$ is more likely to be 'solvable'. Similarly, if $f(x)$ contains more products than compositions, it is easier in general. So, in order of difficulty: $$ \text{products}<\text{compositions}<\text{sums} $$ The argument: there is only one formula for sums when it comes to integrals or derivatives and that is the trivial $\int a(x) + b(x) dx = \int a(x) dx + \int b(x) dx$ or $(a(x)+b(x))' = (a(x))' + (b(x))'$. However, the formula for products and compositions are more powerful and lead more to success. As an example, I will give three integrals of about the same notational length. They are similar but the argument above seems to make a point. Which of the functions below do you consider easier to integrate? $$\color{Red}{\sin(x) (e^x + \cos(x))},\,\,  \color{Blue}{e^{\sin(x)} \cos(x)}\,  \text{or}\color{Green}{\dfrac{1+\cos(x)}{e^x+\sin(x)}}?$$ Or maybe some examples from MSE itself? Consider the list of integrals below. $$\int_1^\infty\dfrac{\operatorname{arccot}\left(1+\frac{2\pi}{\operatorname{arcoth}x-\operatorname{arccsc}x}\right)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\,dx$$ This value is known to agree with a closed form for the first $9000$ digits, yet no satisfactory proof has been given. All the following integrals, though, have closed forms: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1x\sqrt{\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}}\ln\left(\frac{2\,x^2+2\,x+1}{2\,x^2-2\,x+1}\right) \, dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{\ln\left(x+\sqrt2\right)}{\sqrt{2-x}\,\sqrt{1-x}\,\sqrt{\vphantom{1}x}}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\log\log\left(\dfrac{1}{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}-1}\right)\, dx$$ $$\int_0^\infty\dfrac{\ln\left(1+x+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x}\right)\,\ln\left(1+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x+2}\right)}{x^2+2x+1}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x}\ \sqrt[4]x\ \sqrt[4]{2-x\,\sqrt3}}$$ $$\int_0^{\frac{\ln^22}4}\,\dfrac{\arccos\frac{\exp\sqrt x}{\sqrt2}}{1-\exp\sqrt{4\,x}}\,dx$$ So, why is the first one so much more difficult or impossible?

This question arises naturally when I considered doing integrals. What makes an integral hard? Well, the integrand, of course. So why is it hard to integrate some integrands? For starters, I need to say that there are definite and indefinite integrals and that might affect the difficulty of the integral, but in both cases the situation seems the same. Let's say $f(x)$ is the (elementary) integrand. For starters, consider short expressions for $f(x)$. That makes sense, because logically long expressions are harder to integrate on average. So, we consider elementary functions $f(x)$ with a short expression. If $f(x)$ is mainly a product of simple functions, in other words, if $f(x)$ contains more products then sums then by using integration by parts it is clear that the integral of $f(x)$ is more likely to be 'solvable'. Similarly, if $f(x)$ contains more products than compositions, it is easier in general. So, in order of difficulty: $$ \text{products}<\text{compositions}<\text{sums} $$ The argument: there is only one formula for sums when it comes to integrals or derivatives and that is the trivial $\int a(x) + b(x) dx = \int a(x) dx + \int b(x) dx$ or $(a(x)+b(x))' = (a(x))' + (b(x))'$. However, the formula for products and compositions are more powerful and lead more to success. As an example, I will give three integrals of about the same notational length. They are similar but the argument above seems to make a point. Which of the functions below do you consider easier to integrate? $$\color{Red}{\sin(x) (e^x + \cos(x))},\,\,  \color{Blue}{e^{\sin(x)} \cos(x)}\,  \text{or}\color{Green}{\dfrac{1+\cos(x)}{e^x+\sin(x)}}?$$ Or maybe some examples from MSE itself? Consider the list of integrals below. $$\int_1^\infty\dfrac{\operatorname{arccot}\left(1+\frac{2\pi}{\operatorname{arcoth}x-\operatorname{arccsc}x}\right)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\,dx$$ This value is known to agree with a closed form for the first $9000$ digits, yet no satisfactory proof has been given. All the following integrals, though, have closed forms: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1x\sqrt{\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}}\ln\left(\frac{2\,x^2+2\,x+1}{2\,x^2-2\,x+1}\right) \, dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{\ln\left(x+\sqrt2\right)}{\sqrt{2-x}\,\sqrt{1-x}\,\sqrt{\vphantom{1}x}}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\log\log\left(\dfrac{1}{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}-1}\right)\, dx$$ $$\int_0^\infty\dfrac{\ln\left(1+x+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x}\right)\,\ln\left(1+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x+2}\right)}{x^2+2x+1}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x}\ \sqrt[4]x\ \sqrt[4]{2-x\,\sqrt3}}$$ $$\int_0^{\frac{\ln^22}4}\,\dfrac{\arccos\frac{\exp\sqrt x}{\sqrt2}}{1-\exp\sqrt{4\,x}}\,dx$$ So, why is the first one so much more difficult or impossible? Note that the first integral contains more additions while the others have more compositions and products. Those compositions and products lead to possible ways to attack the problem with substitutions, pattern recognitions, integration by parts and rewritting them as (not too complicated) infinite sums.
