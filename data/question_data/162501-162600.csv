I suspect the answer is yes, but I'm far removed from my measure-theory classes and I'm getting tripped up in dealing with the interaction between the projection involved in the definition of $E$ and how measurability works with projections. Most of the references I've been reading about subanalytic sets (Bierstone/Milman, Denkowska, etc) don't talk about whether they are measurable, so I'm not sure whether this is easy and I should be kicking myself or whether it's moderately difficult and I found an interesting question to ask.

Explanations are greatly appreciated.","Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ be open and suppose we have a measurable vector field $F : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^d$ (we consider both the domain $\Omega$ and range $\mathbb{R}^d$ with Lebesgue measure). Is there a widely used notion of an $L^2$ norm for this vector field $F$? I know that, if the range is just $\mathbb{R}$ instead of $\mathbb{R}^d$, then of course the $L^2$ norm is simply $$\left( \int_{\Omega} |F|^2 dm \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.$$ This question has come up for me because I'm reading over a paper that keeps using the notation $||F||_{(L^2(\Omega))^d}$ where $F$ is $C^\infty$ from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$. But I'm not sure what this norm is exactly. Could it just be that the that we are integrating $|F|^2$ again? Only this time, we would need $|\cdot|$ to be the Euclidean norm on $\mathbb{R}^d$ instead of the absolute value function. Explanations are greatly appreciated.",,"['measure-theory', 'notation']"

93,Outer measure defined on sets of $\mathbb R$ - help with showing if outer measure or not,Outer measure defined on sets of  - help with showing if outer measure or not,\mathbb R,"I have a long list of definitions of outer measures that I am trying to (a) show IF they are outer measures, and (b) if it is, determine its outer measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$. My books requirements for an outer measure are: $ \mu^{\ast}(\varnothing) = 0$, if $A \subset B \subset X$, then $\mu^{\ast}(A) \leq \mu^{\ast}(B)$, and if $\{A_n\}$ is an infinite sequence of subsets of $X$, then $\mu^{\ast}\left(\bigcup_n\,A_n\right) \leq \sum_n \, \mu^{\ast}(A_n),$ For instance, two of them, defined on the power set of $\mathbb{R}$, are (from Cohn's book by the way): $\mu_3^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is bounded, and  $1$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_4^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is empty, $1$ if $A$ is non-empty and bounded, and $+\infty$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_5^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is countable, $b$ if $A$ is uncountable, where $b$ can equal a finite number or $+\infty$. First, I am only 90% sure the authors means the reals and no the affinely extended reals: $\mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty\} \cup \{+\infty\}$?? Now for $\mu_3^{\ast}$ , (1) I am assuming the empty set $\varnothing$ is bounded, or else the first criteria of an outer measure fails (and besides I have read different ideas in different place - most seem to think it is both bounded and unbounded?). (2) Then for $A \subset B$ (does the author mean proper, as in not $A \subseteq B$??), I can say that the monotonocity inequality is satisfied if they are both the same, bounded or unbounded, and that, since a bounded set (at least on $\mathbb{R}$) cannot contain an unbounded set, the only remaining possibility is if $A$ is bounded and $B$ is unbounded, in which case the inequality is satisfied. (3) Lastly, it is certain the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ contains bounded sets, but also it contains $\mathbb{R}$ itself, which is unbounded, so the countably infinite union of elements of the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ is 1 (the left-hand side of the inequality). Since there is only one unbounded (a set missing at least one of either left or right boundaries) subset of $\mathbb{R}$(??) then the right-hand side of the inequality is 1. For $\mu_4^{\ast}$ , (1) same as above (2) Bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are of the form $(a,b)$, $[a,b]$, $(a,b]$, or $[a,b)$. So case by case, respecting $A \subset B$ (proper) shows this criteria for outer measure is satisfied: $\hspace{2cm}$ both bounded: $1 \leq 1$ $\hspace{2cm}$ both unbounded: $+\infty \leq +\infty$, as in $\mu^{\ast}((a,+\infty)) \leq \mu^{\ast}(\mathbb{R})$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A = \varnothing$ and $B$ is bounded and $B \neq \varnothing$ implies $0 \leq 1$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A = \varnothing$ and $B$ is unbounded implies $0 \leq +\infty$ $\hspace{2cm}$ $A$ is bounded and $B$ is unbounded implies $1 \leq +\infty$ (3) So for the left hand side of the inequality, $\mu^{\ast}(T:=\cup_n\,A_n)$, I know that $T$ is at least as `big' as $\mathbb{R}$, because $\mathbb{R} \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$.

Therefore, the cardinality is the problem I don't understand here(??). For $\mu_5^{\ast}$ I haven't yet figured out the gist of this with respect to countability, but I do know that countability (not finite) is where there is a bijection between a subset of the naturals ($\aleph_0$), and that the power set of the naturals has cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$. If this is the case (??) then maybe any help with the above can help this problem too. Thank you all for looking at this homework problem - I felt that the only way to accurately describe my questions was in the context of the problem, or else I am afraid there would be a lot of confusion!","I have a long list of definitions of outer measures that I am trying to (a) show IF they are outer measures, and (b) if it is, determine its outer measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}$. My books requirements for an outer measure are: $ \mu^{\ast}(\varnothing) = 0$, if $A \subset B \subset X$, then $\mu^{\ast}(A) \leq \mu^{\ast}(B)$, and if $\{A_n\}$ is an infinite sequence of subsets of $X$, then $\mu^{\ast}\left(\bigcup_n\,A_n\right) \leq \sum_n \, \mu^{\ast}(A_n),$ For instance, two of them, defined on the power set of $\mathbb{R}$, are (from Cohn's book by the way): $\mu_3^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is bounded, and  $1$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_4^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is empty, $1$ if $A$ is non-empty and bounded, and $+\infty$ if $A$ is unbounded. $\mu_5^{\ast}(A) = 0$ if $A$ is countable, $b$ if $A$ is uncountable, where $b$ can equal a finite number or $+\infty$. First, I am only 90% sure the authors means the reals and no the affinely extended reals: $\mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty\} \cup \{+\infty\}$?? Now for $\mu_3^{\ast}$ , (1) I am assuming the empty set $\varnothing$ is bounded, or else the first criteria of an outer measure fails (and besides I have read different ideas in different place - most seem to think it is both bounded and unbounded?). (2) Then for $A \subset B$ (does the author mean proper, as in not $A \subseteq B$??), I can say that the monotonocity inequality is satisfied if they are both the same, bounded or unbounded, and that, since a bounded set (at least on $\mathbb{R}$) cannot contain an unbounded set, the only remaining possibility is if $A$ is bounded and $B$ is unbounded, in which case the inequality is satisfied. (3) Lastly, it is certain the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ contains bounded sets, but also it contains $\mathbb{R}$ itself, which is unbounded, so the countably infinite union of elements of the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ is 1 (the left-hand side of the inequality). Since there is only one unbounded (a set missing at least one of either left or right boundaries) subset of $\mathbb{R}$(??) then the right-hand side of the inequality is 1. For $\mu_4^{\ast}$ , (1) same as above (2) Bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are of the form $(a,b)$, $[a,b]$, $(a,b]$, or $[a,b)$.
