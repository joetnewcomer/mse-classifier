In Miranda's book $$H^1(D)= \tau [D](X)/\operatorname {Im}(\alpha_D),$$ where $\tau[D](X)$ is the group of Laurent tail divisors on $X$ corresponding to the Divisor $D$ and $\alpha_D$ is the truncation map which removes all terms of order $-D(p)$ or higher from the Laurent series of a meromorphic function. I.e. $H^1(D)$ measures the failure of being able to solve Mittag-Leffler problems on $X$ of finding a meromorphic function with a given tail.

Show that $I(Y)\subset k[x,y,z]=A$ is a prime ideal of height 2 which cannot be generated by two elements. Firstly, my question is that how can I check whether $Y$ is Zariski closed or not. Is it always the case that, a subset given by $x=f(t), y=g(t), z=h(t); f,g,h \in k[t]$ is always Zariski closed ? My attempt was to prove that $A/I(Y) \cong k[t^3,t^4,t^5]$ to show $I(Y)$ is prime.

33,On the functorial point of view in algebraic geometry.,On the functorial point of view in algebraic geometry.,,"Here's a question I've been thinking about lately. I hope it's not too vague - I apologize in advance if this should be the case. Suppose you want to do algebraic geometry using the $\textit{functorial}$ point of view. I'm thinking of questions like $\textit{moduli problems}$ . It seems to me that the functorial point of view should be very natural in this context - given that a moduli space is a representing object of a moduli functor by the very definition. Now I always thought when doing moduli theory, one way to trying to study the moduli problem is by studying the $\textit{geometry}$ of the moduli space of the problem (assuming it exists etc...). One way to study the geometry of a moduli space $\mathcal M$ is by studying its $S$ -valued points $S \to \mathcal M$ . This feels like a very natural approach when it comes to moduli spaces, as one knows the set of morphisms $S \to \mathcal M$ . However, I feel like I'd be interested in morphisms having special properties, like (open/closed) embeddings, smooth morphisms etc. Given that the construction of moduli schemes seems to be rather complicated most of the time I'd rather not like to go through the explicit construction when it comes to checking that a given morphism $S \to \mathcal M$ satisfies a certain property. So ideally, I should be able to tell whether $S \to \mathcal M$ has certain properties $\textit{purely}$ from the $\textit{functorial point of view}$ . One example: Often one is able to compute the tangent space of a scheme $X$ as the set of $k[\epsilon]$ -valued points of $X$ - something that one can understand rather explicitly for moduli spaces. I think this is actually used to deduce that the tangent space of Hilbert schemes is given as certain first-order deformations. And that through computing these deformations one can really prove interesting results on the moduli problem ""classified"" by Hilbert schemes (i.e. by knowing the dimension of the tangent space etc). So to summarize: Is there a (rather?) complete dictionary translating properties of morphisms of schemes into properties of their corresponding natural transformations? I know that there are translation for open/closed embeddings. I'm not so sure about proper/smooth/unramified and other important properties though.

Any comment on that would also be quite helpful).","This is probably a silly question, but I'm a bit confused. Regarding exercises 6.11 and 6.12 of Chapter II of Hartshorne: Let $X$ be a nonsingular projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X$ with rank $r$ (at the generic point). Part 11(c) says there is a divisor $D$ and a short exact sequence: $0 \rightarrow O_X(D)^{\oplus r} \rightarrow \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{J} \rightarrow 0$ where $\mathcal{J}$ is a torsion sheaf. But $X$ is defined over a field, doesn't that imply that $\mathcal{J} = 0$? (Since $H^0(X,\mathcal{J}) = \bigoplus_{P \in X} \mathcal{J}_P$, and $H^0(X,\mathcal{J}) = 0$ being a torsion $k$-module, hence all the stalks of $\mathcal{J}$ are $0$). That would mean all coherent sheaves on $X$ of rank $r$ are locally free, I don't quite believe that. (Side note: What I was trying to think about originally is whether such a sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ has global sections or not by considering the degree of the divisor $D$. Any comment on that would also be quite helpful).",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'projective-schemes', 'coherent-sheaves']"

This is because we know that if $Z_i$ is an irreducible subset of $Y$, then $\overline{Z_i}$ is irreducible in $Y$ and thus it is also irreducible in $\overline{Y}$. Thus we have that dim$Y$ $\leq$ dim$\overline{Y}$. Now dim$\overline{Y}$ is finite as $Y$ is a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space, so that it is irreducible and dense, yielding $\overline{Y}$ is an affine variety. Thus we can choose a maximal chain of distinct closed irreducible subsets of $Y$, $Z_0 \subset ... \subset Z_n$, with dim$Y=n$. Now $\overline{Z_0} \subset ... \subset \overline{Z_n}$ is a maximal chain of closed irreducible subsets of $\overline{Y}$, this is through a contradiction argument that uses the fact that a non-empty open subset of an irreducible space is irreducible and dense. I omit it here as my proof goes into too much detail. Now from here Hartshorne goes to prove the dimension is $n$ by converting these to prime ideals and finding a maximum chain of those. I understand his proof and it is correct, but is it not correct to say that $\overline{Y}$ is an affine variety whose dimension is given by the supremum of all integers $n$ such that there exists a chain $A_0 \subset ... \subset A_n$ of distinct irreducible closed subsets of $\overline{Y}$? We proved that $\overline{Z_0} \subset ... \subset \overline{Z_n}$ was maximal so that by definition dim$\overline{Y}$ = $n$ = dim$Y$. I am having trouble seeing a flaw in my proof and do not understand why it is necessary to go to a chain of prime ideals in order to argue the dimension of $\overline{Y}$ is in fact $n$.

If $X,Y$ are projective varieties such that the corresponding ""bigraded"" cohomology rings are isomorphic, do we then have $X \cong Y$? If this is false, what about the special case $Y=\mathbb{P}^d$ (here the cohomology ring is quite simple).","Let $X$ be a projective variety with ample sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Then $H^*(\oplus_n \mathcal{O}_X(n))$ is a graded algebra via the cup product: $H^i(\mathcal{O}(n)) \otimes H^j(\mathcal{O}(m)) \to H^{i+j}(\mathcal{O}(n) \otimes \mathcal{O}(m)) \cong H^{i+j}(\mathcal{O}(n+m))$. Remark that each individual homogeneous component is a graded abelian group (via $n$). Does this ""bigraded"" cohomology ring have a name, and is it studied in the literature?

99,A Definition in Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra,A Definition in Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra,,"In Eisenbud's commutative algebra book, he defines a Weil divisor to be an element of the free abelian group generated by codimension 1 prime ideals of a ring $R$. He then goes on to define a Cartier divisor as an element of the group of invertible ideals. (p. 261) The relationship between his definition of Weil divisor here and the usual definition seems fairly straightforward. However, I'm having trouble seeing any sort of relationship between what he calls a Cartier divisor and the usual definition. This is the only place I've seen this group called the group of Cartier divisors. Any help would be appreciated.","In Eisenbud's commutative algebra book, he defines a Weil divisor to be an element of the free abelian group generated by codimension 1 prime ideals of a ring $R$.
