Of course, this would not be a manifold (indeed, in computer science, discrete ""manifolds"", e.g. meshes or point sets, that do this are called ""non-manifold""), but perhaps there is a generalized notion that admits this and analysis? The most obvious issue is local coordinates are obviously integral in nature. But is there no way to parameterize fractals locally (which are of fractional dimension)? Related questions: Can a fractal be a manifold? If so, will its boundary (if it exists) be strictly one dimension lower? Can a fractal be a manifold?

27,Why does Milnor need to move to the Riemann sphere to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra?,Why does Milnor need to move to the Riemann sphere to prove the fundamental theorem of algebra?,,"On pages 8 and 9 of Topology from the differentiable viewpoint , Milnor proves the fundamental theorem of algebra. He does so by first turning our polynomial $P:\mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ into a function $f:\hat{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ on the Riemann sphere. But, I don't see why moving to $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is necessary. Here's the argument: Next observe that $f$ has only a finite number of critical points; for $P$   fails to be a local diffeomorphism only at the zeros of the derivative   polynomial $P$ and there are only finitely many   zeros since $P'$ is not identically zero. The set of regular values of $f$, being a sphere with finitely many points removed, is therefore connected. Hence the locally constant function $\#f^{-1}(y)$ must actually be constant   on this set.

If a coffee cup and a donut are given to me, I can realize from their shapes that they are homeomorphic. If $f:X\to Y$ be an isometry, then one can coincide the semi-riemannian manifold $X$ to the semi-riemannian manifold $Y$, it is sufficient for me to visualize the equivalence in this case. Question 1: Is the above statement true? Question 2: I have no idea to visualize the equivalence in the Manifold theory case, diffeomorphism. Can someone help me? Can I judge about the equivalence of the two manifolds from their shapes in this case? Thanks.",,"['general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'visualization']"

I intend to show that such map doesn't exist using topological covering/lifting theory.

Then I tried to consider a path $\gamma:[0,1] \to S^2$ with property $\gamma(0)= -\gamma(1)$, therefore $\gamma(0), \gamma(1)$ are antipodal. And therefore (by property of $f$) also holds $f(\gamma(0)) = f(-\gamma(1)) = -f(\gamma(1))$. I guess that considering this property one can deduce a contradiction by considering a lift $\widetilde{\omega}:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ of the path $\omega:= f \circ \gamma$. Can anybody explain what here goes wrong/ how to get the desired contradiction?

If no such integer exists, we write $LS(X) = \infty$. It should be noted that some references (e.g. Wikipedia ) use a different normalisation which differs from the above by one. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category is a homotopy invariant which enjoys has several nice properties, making it an interesting invariant to study. I wonder, however, whether there is any difference between using an open cover by sets where the inclusions are nullhomotopic (sets which are sometimes called 'contractible in $X$') and using an open cover by contractible sets. Define the alternative Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a topological space $X$ to be the smallest integer $k$ (if it exists) such that there is an open cover $\{U_0, \dots, U_k\}$ of $X$ such that each $U_i$ is contractible; we denote this by $LS'(X) = k$.

Its restriction to $\gamma_1\times\gamma_2$ is now $\Psi$. The degree of $\overline{\Psi}$ restricted to $\partial N$ is now zero. So we get  $$\text{deg}\biggl(\overline{\Psi}\biggm| {\gamma_1\times \gamma_2}\biggr) + \text{deg}\biggl(\overline{\Psi}\biggm|{\bigcup_{m\in M\cap \gamma_2}  \mathcal{S}(m,\epsilon)}    \biggr) =0 \text{.} $$ The first term gives the linking number defined by degree. How do I see that the second term gives the intersection number? I know this has to do with the orientations, but I don't have enough feeling for this yet, to write this down rigorously. I really hope that someone could explain how this works or at least give me hint. Thanks in advance.",,"['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'knot-theory', 'knot-invariants']"

92,Confusion about topology on space of maps,Confusion about topology on space of maps,,"In this set of notes on compactly generated spaces by Charles Rezk, the author states the following result: Proposition 8.6. If $X$ and $Y$ are k-spaces and $Z$ is any space, then a function $f: X \times^k Y \to Z$ is continuous if and only if its adjoint $\widetilde{f}: X \to \mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is defined and continuous. Here, $X \times^k Y$ denotes the compactly generated product, that is, the $k$ -ification of the usual cartesian product of topological spaces, and the topology on the set of maps $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is defined as follows: a subset $U \subseteq \mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is open if and only if, for every compact Hausdorff space $K$ and every map $t: K \times Y \to Z$ , the set $\widetilde{t}(U)$ is open in $K$ , where $\widetilde{t}: K \to \mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is the adjoint function of $t$ . I have a question about the forward direction of the statement. The proof is as follows: The adjoint $\widetilde{f}$ really takes values in $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ , because $\widetilde{f}(x): Y \to Z$ can be written as the composition $f \circ i_x$ , where $i_x: Y \to X \times^k Y$ is the map defined as $i_x(y)= (x,y)$ for every $y \in Y$ . Notice that $i_x$ is continuous when considering $X \times^k Y$ as the codomain because it can be regarded as the map induced by the constant map $Y \to X$ sending every point to $x$ and the identity $\mathrm{id}_Y: Y \to Y$ . Here we are using the fact that $\times^k$ is the categorical product in the category $\mathsf{CG}$ of compactly generated spaces and continuous maps, so it is clear that both $X$ and $Y$ need to be compactly generated. If $U \subseteq \mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is open, and $t: K \to X$ is a map, with $K$ compact and Hausdorff, then we have the equality $t^{-1}(\widetilde{f}^{-1}(U)) = \widetilde{g}^{-1}(U)$ , where $g = f \circ (t \times \mathrm{id}_Y)$ . This is essentially the naturality of the exponential adjunction. $t \times \mathrm{id}_Y$ can be seen as a map of type $K \times Y \to X \times^k Y$ because the usual cartesian product $K \times Y$ is already compactly generated. This means that $g$ is a map of type $K \times Y \to Z$ , so $\widetilde{g}^{-1}(U)$ is open in $K$ by the definition of the topology on $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ . This shows that $\widetilde{f}^{-1}(U)$ is compactly open in $X$ , but since $X$ is compactly generated by  hypothesis, it follows that $\widetilde{f}^{-1}(U)$ is open. My question is: doesn't a similar argument work if we suppose only $X$ is compactly generated, but suppose instead that $f$ is of type $X \times Y \to Z$ ? Under these hypothesis, the ""tricky"" parts in the proof above become automatic: $\widetilde{f}$ takes values in $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ by standard properties of the cartesian product, and $t \times \mathrm{id}_Y$ is a map of type $K \times Y \to X \times Y$ automatically, no need to mess with the compactly generated product $X \times^k Y$ . Is this correct? I think it is, but since this is the only reference I found where a topology is defined directly on $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ instead of $k$ -ifying the test-open topology or the space of $k$ -continuous maps, I'm a little uncertain. Moreover, this alternative result implies another one which feels wrong to me. Corollary. For any spaces $X$ and $Y$ , the space $\mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ is compactly generated. Proof. Let $A \subseteq \mathrm{Map}(Y,Z)$ be a compactly open subset.

(Notice that neither Wikipedia nor nlab seem  to answer this question.) Specifically: Let $X$ be a set. A net in $X$ is defined as a function $P \to X$ from a directed partial order $P$ to $X$ . Let $\to$ be a relation from nets in $X$ to elements of $X$ , thought of as net convergence. Now let us call $A \subseteq X$ closed if it is closed under net convergence: $$(x_p)_{p\in P} \to x ~ \wedge~ \forall p \in P (x_p \in A) \implies x \in A.$$ Question. What are axioms for $\to$ which guarantee that this is a topology on $X$ such that the notion of net convergence from the topology is exaclty $\to$ ? If I am not mistaken, we just need that $\to$ is compatible with subnets: A subnet of $P \to X$ is a composition $Q \to P \to X$ for some cofinal map of partial orders $Q \to P$ . We need to require that if a net converges to some element, then every subnet convergences to that element as well. Then all the axioms of a topology are satisfied: $\emptyset$ is closed since there is no net with values in $\emptyset$ (remember that directed sets are non-empty by definition). The intersection of closed subsets is closed for trivial reasons. Now if $ A,B$ are closed and a net $(x_p)_{p \in P}$ with entries in $A \cup B$ converges to some element $x \in X \setminus A$ , then it has a subnet with entries in $B$ , thus $x \in B$ .

I would appreciate references to the literature. It seems to be a very basic question. But when I look for these kind of characterizations, the texts seem to focus on filters instead. Answer.

The intersection of closed subsets is closed for trivial reasons. Now if are closed and a net with entries in converges to some element , then it has a subnet with entries in , thus . This means that we just need one axiom, which is a bit weird. What I am missing? In particular, I don't see directly how to deduce that a constant net converges to . I would appreciate references to the literature. It seems to be a very basic question. But when I look for these kind of characterizations, the texts seem to focus on filters instead. Answer. The question is answered by Theorem 9 on p. 74 in Kelley's book General topology . Thanks Chris Custer for pointing this out.","X X P \to X P X \to X X A \subseteq X (x_p)_{p\in P} \to x ~ \wedge~ \forall p \in P (x_p \in A) \implies x \in A. \to X \to \to P \to X Q \to P \to X Q \to P \emptyset \emptyset  A,B (x_p)_{p \in P} A \cup B x \in X \setminus A B x \in B (x)_{p \in P} x","['general-topology', 'reference-request', 'nets']"
