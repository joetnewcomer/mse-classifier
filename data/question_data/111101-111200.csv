Now suppose we have subgroups $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n$ , each of which is normal, and such that $\displaystyle \bigcap_{H_j} = \{e\}$ .

33,Establishing that a function is a well-defined homomorphism,Establishing that a function is a well-defined homomorphism,,"I am working with the group homomorphism $f: G \to \text{Aut (G)}$ , $g \mapsto f_g = ghg^{-1}$ , and am trying to prove that $f$ is a well-defined homomorphism. To show that $f$ is well-defined, we must establish three facts: (1) that $f_g$ is a well-defined function; (2) that $f_g$ is in fact an element of $\text{Aut ($G$)}$ , so $f$ actually sends an element $g \in G$ to an element of the codomain of $f$ and (3) if $g = h$ , then then $f(g) = f(h)$ . Proof of (1):  Suppose $x = y$ . It suffices to show that for a fixed $g \in G$ , we have $gxg^{-1} = gyg^{-1}$ . By cancellation, we have \begin{align*} gxg^{-1} = gyg^{-1} \iff gx = gy \iff x = y. \end{align*} This verifies (1). Proof of (2): We need to show first that $f_g$ is a bijection, for which it suffices to exhibit an inverse, $f_{g^{-1}}$ , such that \begin{align*} f_g = f_{g^{-1}} = f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_g = \text{id}_G. \end{align*} Define $f_{g^{-1}} = g^{-1} x g$ . Then, for an arbitrary $h \in H$ , we have: \begin{align*} (f_g \circ f_{g^{-1}}) (h) & = f_g (f_{g^{-1}} (h)) \\ & = f_g (g^{-1} hg) \\ & = g(g^{-1} hg)g^{-1} \\ & = (gg^{-1})h(gg^{-1}) \\ & = e_G he_G \\ & = h \end{align*} Since $h$ was arbitrary, we have $f_g \circ f_{g^{-1}}$ . For the reverse direction, for arbitrary $x \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*} (f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_g)(h) & = f_{g^{-1}} (f_g (h)) \\ & = f_{g^{-1}} (ghg^{-1}) \\ & = g^{-1} (ghg^{-1})g \\ & = (g^{-1} g) h (g^{-1} g) \\ & = e_G h e_G h \\ & = h \end{align*} Since $h$ was arbitrary, $f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_G = \text{id}_G$ , so we have exhibited a proper inverse for $f_g$ . Hence, $f_g$ is a bijection. It suffices to establish that $f_g$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to $G$ . It suffices to demonstrate that $f_g$ satisfies the homomorphism property. For any $x, y \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*} f_g (xy) & = g(xy)g^{-1} \\ & = (gx)(yg^{-1}) \\ & = (gx)e_G (yg^{-1}) \\ & = (gx)(g^{-1} g)(yg^{-1}) \\ & = (gxg^{-1}) (gyg^{-1}) \\ & = f_g (x) f_G (y). \end{align*} Hence, $f_g \in \text{Aut ($G$)}$ . This verifies (2). Proof of (3). Let $x, y \in G$ , and suppose $x = y$ . It suffices to show that the resulting automorphism, $f_x (h) = xhx^{-1}$ and $f_y (h) = ygy^{-1}$ , represent the same mapping. Since $f_x (h)$ and $f_y (y)$ have the same domain, $G$ , it suffices to show that $f_x (h) = f_y (h)$ for all $h \in H$ . That is, $xhx^{-1} = yhy^{-1}$ . We have: \begin{align*} x = y \iff xh = yh \iff xhx^{-1} = yhy^{-1}. \end{align*} This verifies (3). These prove that $f$ is well-defined. It suffices to establish that it obeys the homomorphism property. Let $x, y \in G$ . We must show that $f(xy) = f(x) f(y)$ . For arbitrary $h \in G$ , we have: \begin{align*} f(xy) (h) & = f_{xy} (h) \\ & = (xy)h(xy)^{-1} \\ & = (xy)h(y^{-1} x^{-1}) \\ & = x(yhy^{-1})x^{-1} \\ & = (f_x \circ f_y)(h) \\ & = f(x)f(y)(h) \end{align*} This establishes that $f$ is a homomorphism.","I am working with the group homomorphism , , and am trying to prove that is a well-defined homomorphism.
