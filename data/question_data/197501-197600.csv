1,$TS^1$ is Diffeomorphic to $S^1\times \mathbf R$.,is Diffeomorphic to .,TS^1 S^1\times \mathbf R,"I know this is a very basic question. But I am unable to get every detail right.

My problem with this is that: $\left(p_2 \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}\right|_{p}-p_1\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\right|_p \right)$ is not really a member of $T_pS_1$. It lies in $di_p(T_pS^1)\subseteq T_p\mathbf R^2$, where $i:S^1\to \mathbf R^2$ is the inclusion map. (Reason: The manifold structure of $S_1$ is governed by the fact that $i:S^1\to \mathbf R^2$ is a smooth embedding, and thus, a tangent vector $X_p\in T_p\mathbf R^2$ is in $di_p(T_pS^1)$ if an only if $X_p\xi=0$ for all $\xi\in \mathcal C^\infty(\mathbf R^2)$ with $\xi|S^1\equiv 0$.)

3,Hopf's theorem on CMC surfaces,Hopf's theorem on CMC surfaces,,"I got stuck reading the proof of the following theorem: Theorem (Heinz Hopf) Let $X: S^2\to \mathbb R^3$ be a constant mean curvature immersion. Then $X(S^2)$ is a round sphere. Proof: Let $g_{S^3}$ denote the round metric on $S^2$ (such that the area is $4\pi$). By the uniformization theorem there exists a map $\phi: S^2 \to S^2$ such that $(X\circ \phi)^\ast g_{\mathbb R^3}$ is conformal to $g_{S^2}$. Hence we may assume that $X$ is a conformal map $(S^2, g_{S^2}) \to (\mathbb R^3, g_{\mathbb R^3})$. Let $\pi: (\mathbb R^2, g_{\mathbb R^2})\to (S^2\setminus \{pt\}, g_{S^2})$ be stereographic projection. Let $Y = X\circ \pi$. Then $Y$ is a conformal immersion from $\mathbb R^2$ to $\mathbb R^3$. If $\nu = \nu^\alpha e_\alpha$ denotes the unit normal vector field along this immersion, then $\Delta \nu^\alpha + |h|^2 \nu^\alpha = 0$, where $\Delta = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial u^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial v^2}$ is the usual Laplacian and where $|h|^2$ is the length of the second fundamental form tensor along the immersion. Edit: Here is the remainder of the proof (from memory). In particular, this shows that $\Delta \nu$ is parallel to $\nu$. Identifying $\mathbb R^2\cong \mathbb C$ and using complex notation ${\partial_z} = \frac 12 \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial u} - i\frac{\partial}{\partial v}\right)$, $\overline{\partial_z} = \frac 12 \left(\frac{\partial }{\partial u} + i\frac{\partial}{\partial v}\right)$, we have $\Delta \nu = 4 \partial_z\overline{\partial_z}\nu$. Note that $\partial_z\nu \perp \nu$, whence $\partial_z\nu \perp \Delta \nu$. It follows that  $$\overline{\partial_z} (\partial_z\nu)^2 = 2 \partial_z \nu \cdot \partial_z\overline{\partial_z}\nu = \frac 12 \partial_z \nu \cdot \Delta \nu = 0.$$ This implies that the complex-valued function $z\mapsto (\partial_z\nu)^2$ is holomorphic. Here $$(\partial_z \nu )^2 = (\partial_u\nu - i \partial_v \nu)^2 = (|\partial_u\nu|^2 - |\partial_v\nu|^2) - 2i \partial_u \nu \cdot \partial_v\nu.$$ It now follows from the conformal invariance of the Dirichlet energy $E(u) = \int_M |\nabla u|^2 \, \mathrm{dvol_g}$ that $\int_{\mathbb R^2} |(\partial_z \nu)^2| \, < \infty$. Indeed, the Dirichlet energy of $\nu$ over $\mathbb R^2$ (with respect to the Euclidean metric), bounds $\int_{\mathbb R^2} |(\partial_z \nu)^2|$. Now $\nu$ can be pulled-back to a vector field on the sphere via stereographic projection (which is conformal), and the Dirichlet energy can be calculated there (with respect to the round metric). But the pull-back of $\nu$ extends to a smooth vector field on all of $S^2$, and $S^2$ is compact. Therefore its Dirichlet energy must be finite. It follows from $\int_{\mathbb R^2}|(\partial_z \nu)^2|<\infty$, that the (holomorphic) function $(\partial_z\nu)^2$ is identically $0$. This is equivalent to $|\partial_u \nu| = |\partial_v\nu|$ and $\partial_u \nu \cdot \partial_v \nu = 0$. Write $\partial_u \nu = h^u_u \partial_u Y + h^v_u \partial_v Y$, $\partial_v \nu = h^u_v \partial_u Y + h_v^v\partial_v Y$. It follows from the conformality of $Y$ together with the above, that $h^u_v H = h^u_v (h^u_u + h^v_v) = 0$, $|h^u_u| = |h^v_v|$. This is only possible if $h^u_u = h^v_v = H/2$ and $h^u_v = 0$. But then $\partial_u \nu = H/2 \partial_u Y$ and $\partial_v \nu = H/2\partial_v Y$, imply that $Y = c + 2/H \nu$ for some constant vector $c$. This shows that $Y$, and by continuity also $X$, map into a sphere. $X$ is onto, because it is open (being an immersion) and closed (being continuous, mapping from a compact set).

Relative to such adapted coordinates, the mapping $C$ takes the form $C: (x,\dot{x},u)\mapsto (x,\dot{x},u,-\Gamma_x(\dot{x},u))$ , where $\Gamma_x:\Bbb{R}^n\times\Bbb{R}^p\to\Bbb{R}^p$ is bilinear (the minus sign is merely convention to make things match up with the usual Christoffel symbols). Question. Suppose we are given two vector bundles $E,F$ over $M$ , with respective linear connections $C_E,C_F$ . How can I define abstractly (i.e without any references to coordinates) a connection $C_{\text{Hom}(E,F)}$ in the bundle $\text{Hom}(E,F)$ ? I have already managed to define it in coordinates, meaning I figured out how, given local coordinates, to define the $\Gamma$ for $\text{Hom}(E,F)$ in terms of $\Gamma$ for $E$ and $F$ . Then, I used the appropriate transformation laws for $\Gamma$ 's to check that everything works out so that we do indeed obtain a globally well-defined mapping $\text{C}_{\text{Hom}(E,F)}$ . I will include this local definition if anyone requests it; but the notation is a little heavy so I suppress it for now. The reason I ask this question is because defining things locally and then verifying the compatibility conditions is a little tedious, especially since $\Gamma$ has a somewhat complicated transformation behavior. By the way, I have already determined how to define connections on $E\oplus F$ and $E\otimes F$ , in an abstract manner (and also locally). Also, I'm aware that $\text{Hom}(E,F)\cong E^*\otimes F$ , so if someone can provide an abstract definition for $C_{E^*}$ in terms of $C_E$ that is also sufficient. Thank you.

Computing the differential of a vector field ( $\vec{r}=x^i\vec{e}_i$ , in this case) feels strange, as in differential geometry differentials are usually considered to be alternating $k$ -forms, so it would only make sense to talk about the differential of a scalar field (aka its exterior derivative).

14,(Proof verification) Extension Lemma for Functions on Submanifolds,(Proof verification) Extension Lemma for Functions on Submanifolds,,"There is a similar question about this lemma in Lee's book , but I wasn't really satisfied with the detail in the proposed solution. In particular, the OP of the linked question doesn't describe how to get the smooth maps which I am calling $f_p$ below. I am hoping someone can give critical feedback on this proof and point out where, if anywhere, I have erred. Lemma 5.34 (Extension Lemma for Functions on Submanifolds). Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifold, $S\subset M$ is a smooth submanifold,   and $f\in C^\infty(S)$ . If $S$ is embedded, then there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$ and a smooth function $\widetilde f\in C^\infty(U)$ such that $\widetilde f|_S = f$ . If $S$ is properly embedded, then the neighborhood $U$ in part (a) can be taken to be all of $M$ . Proof of 1: Let $n = \dim S$ and $m = \dim M$ . Since $S$ is embedded, each $p\in S$ is in the domain of a slice chart $(U_p,\varphi_p)$ in $M$ such that $S\cap U_p$ is a single slice in $U$ . Since $f$ is smooth, at each $p\in S$ we can find a slice chart so that $\mathbf{f}_p:= f\circ\varphi_p^{-1}\colon \varphi_p(S\cap U_p)\to\Bbb R$ is smooth. Since $\varphi_p(S\cap U_p) = \{(x^1,\dots,x^n,0,\dots,0)\in \varphi_p(U_p)\}$ , and $\mathbf{f}_p$ is smooth on this set, there is a smooth extension $\widehat f_p\colon V_p\subset\Bbb R^m\to \Bbb R$ of $\mathbf{f}_p$ , where $V_p$ is an open set in $\Bbb R^m$ containing $\varphi(p)$ . (Here is where I see a potential ""bug"" in this proof. By the definition of a smooth map on $S$ , the map $\mathbf{f}_p$ is ""smooth."" However, since $\mathbf{f}_p$ is defined on a set that is not an open subset of $\Bbb R^n$ , I believe, and please do address this point, ""smooth"" means that there is the extension I am calling $\widehat f_p$ .) The restriction of $\widehat f_p$ to the open set $W_p := \varphi_p(U_p)\cap V_p $ is still smooth and gives us a map $f_p\colon \varphi_p^{-1}(W_p)\to\Bbb R$ defined by $f_p(x) = \big(\widehat f_p|_{W_p}\big)\circ\varphi_p(x)$ . The collection of open sets $\varphi_p^{-1}(W_p)$ is an open cover of $S$ , so let $(\psi_p)_{p\in S}$ be a partition of unity subordinate to this cover. For any $x\in U:=\bigcup_{p\in S}\varphi^{-1}(W_p)$ , define $\widetilde f(x) = \sum_{p\in S}\psi_p(x)f_p(x)$ . If $x\in S$ , then $$ \widetilde f(x) = \sum_{p\in S}\psi_p(x) f(x) = f(x). $$ Hence $\widetilde f$ is an extension of $f$ . Since the collection of supports of the $\psi_p$ is locally finite, each point in $U$ has a neighborhood in which the sum is finite, so this defines a smooth map since every point has a neighborhood such that $\widetilde f$ restricted to that neighborhood is smooth. Hence $\widetilde f\in C^\infty(U)$ is the desired extension. $\square$ Proof of 2: In this case, the only thing that changes is that $S$ is actually closed in $M$ by a lemma in Lee's book. By appending $M\smallsetminus S$ to the collection $\{\varphi_p^{-1}(W_p)\}$ and taking a partition of unity $\{\psi_p: p\in S\}\cup\{\psi_0\}$ subordinate to this open cover of $M$ with $\operatorname{supp}\psi_0\subset M\smallsetminus S$ ,  define $\widetilde f(x) = \psi_0(x) + \sum_{p\in S}\psi_p(x)f_p(x)$ , where $f_p$ is defined in the first part. $\square$","There is a similar question about this lemma in Lee's book , but I wasn't really satisfied with the detail in the proposed solution.

Intuitively, we should have $\bar{X} = X + X^\perp$, where $X^\perp$ is normal to $X$. The choice of $X^\perp$ should be arbitrary. Thus $B(X,Y)$ will not be unique.

39,Notational Ambiguity: Covariant Derivative,Notational Ambiguity: Covariant Derivative,,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection. Now, I am a bit puzzled by a serious notational ambiguity, namely for the second covariant derivative. To explain myself, let us consider a vector field $v\in\Gamma(TM)$ . Then, the notation $\nabla_{a}\nabla_{b}$ can mean two things: Some authors use the notation $\nabla_{a}:=\nabla_{\partial_{a}}$ . In this case, $\nabla_{\partial_{b}}v\in\Gamma(TM)$ and $\nabla_{\partial_{a}}(\nabla_{\partial_{b}}v)\in\Gamma(TM)$ . In local coordinates, we get $$\nabla_{\partial_{a}}\nabla_{\partial_{b}}v=(\partial_{a}(\partial_{b}v^{c}+\Gamma_{db}^{c}v^{d})+\Gamma_{ad}^{c}(\partial_{b}v^{d}+\Gamma_{eb}^{d}v^{e}))\partial_{c}$$ Some authors, especially in the physics literature (but for example also in Wald's book on GR), write expressions like $\nabla_{a}\nabla_{b}v^{c}$ to indicate the coefficients of the $(1,2)$ tensor obtained by applying $\nabla$ twice. In other words, $\nabla_{a}$ is acting on the $(1,1)$ tensor with coefficients $\nabla_{b}v^{c}=\partial_{b}v^{c}-\Gamma_{bd}^{c}v^{d}$ , i.e. $$\nabla_{a}\nabla_{b}v^{c}=\partial_{a}(\partial_{b}v^{c}+\Gamma_{db}^{c}v^{d})+\Gamma_{ad}^{c}(\partial_{b}v^{d}+\Gamma_{eb}^{d}v^{e})\color{red}{-\Gamma_{ab}^{d}(\partial_{d}v^{c}+\Gamma_{de}^{c}v^{e})}\quad (=:v^{c}_{;a;b})$$ So, the difference is basically the red term. This is actually well-known: Usually, one defines the second covariant derivative globally as the operator $$\nabla^{2}_{X,Y}v:=\nabla_{X}\nabla_{Y}v\color{red}{-\nabla_{\nabla_{X}Y}v}$$ where the second piece essentially corresponds to the red stuff appearing in 2. In other words, the construction in (1.) is the piece $\nabla_{\partial_{a}}\nabla_{\partial_{b}}v$ , while the construction in (2.) corresponds to the full second covariant derivative $\nabla_{\partial_{a},\partial_{b}}v$ . Now, my problem is, since some authors unfortunately use the notation $\nabla_{a}\nabla_{b}$ for $\nabla_{\partial_{a}}\nabla_{\partial_{b}}$ , how can I know which one of the above someone is using? As an explicit example: Consider a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ . Then, one can find in many books that the linearization of the Ricci tensor takes the form $$\mathrm{Ric}(g)_{ab}\xrightarrow{g=g_{0}+\lambda h+\mathcal{O}(\lambda^{2})}-\frac{1}{2}g_{0}^{cd}\nabla_{c}\nabla_{d} h_{ab}+\frac{1}{2}(2\nabla_{c}\nabla_{(a}h^{c}_{b)}-\nabla_{a}\nabla_{b}\mathrm{tr}_{g_{0}}(h))$$ where all the covariant derivatives are with respect to the background metric $g_{0}$ . Now, in this formula, is $g_{0}^{cd}\nabla_{c}\nabla_{d}$ as in my point (2.) above (=the connection Laplacian ) or as in my point (1.), i.e. $g_{0}^{cd}\nabla_{\partial_{c}}\nabla_{\partial_{d}}$ ?

Consider the function $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x)=\text{dist}_M^2(p,x)$ , and $p \in M$ is fixed. Show that $\text{grad}(f)=-2\exp^{-1}_x(p)$ as vectors in $T_xM$ . (Assuming that $\exp^{-1}$ exists and is smooth etc.) My attempt at a proof: We must show that $\langle -2\exp^{-1}_x(p), \cdot \rangle_x = df(\cdot)$ as 1-forms at $x$ . Let $e_1,\dots,e_n$ be an orthonormal basis of $T_pM$ and introduce normal coordinates at $p$ : $x=(x^1,\dots,x^n) \leftrightarrow x=\exp_p(x^i e_i)$ . If $q=\exp_p(v)$ then $\text{dist}_M (p,q)=||v||_p$ and so $f(x)=||x^i e_i||^2_p=\sum (x^i)^2$ , where the second equality follows from the fact that the metric is the identity at $p$ (in these coordinates). So $df=\sum 2x^i dx^i$ . $(*)$ On the other hand, the geodesic ""from x to p"" is the same as the geodesic ""from p to x"", except that the direction is reversed. It should therefore be true that $p=\exp_x(-S_{p \rightarrow x}x^i e_i )=\exp_x(-x^i S_{p \rightarrow x} e_i)$ where $S_{p \rightarrow x}$ is the parallel transport from $p$ to $x$ .

Is it true that $\omega$ is invariant under the antipodal map? i.e let $f(x)=-x$ , does $f^*\omega=\omega$ hold? The assumption implies that for any hemisphere $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^2$ , we have $$ \int_{A}\omega=\int_{f(A)}\omega=\int_{A}f^*\omega=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \omega. \tag{1}$$ Edit: Lemma 1: $\omega$ satisfies $(1)$ if and only if $\int_{A}L_X\omega=0$ for every  Killing field $X$ and hemisphere $A$ . Proof: $\Rightarrow$ Suppose $\omega$ satisfies $(1)$ : Let $\phi_t$ be the flow of a Killing field $X$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$ , and let $A$ be a hemisphere. Since all the $\phi_t(A)$ are hemispheres we get $$ \int_{\phi_t(A)}\omega=\int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\text{const},$$ so $$ 0=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}L_X\omega.$$ $\Leftarrow$ Suppose $\omega$ satisfies $\int_{A}L_X\omega=0$ for every  Killing field $X$ and hemisphere $A$ : Let $A$ be a hemisphere. We want to show $ \int_{A}\omega=\int_{-A}\omega$ . There exist a Killing field $X$ s.t its flow takes $A$ to $-A$ at some time $t=t_0$ . (i.e if $\phi_t$ is the flow, $\phi_{t_0}(A)=-A$ ). Now, $$ \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=s} \int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=s}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\phi_s^*L_X\omega=\int_{\phi_s(A)}L_X\omega=0,$$ where the last equality is exactly the assumption. Since $s$ was arbitrary, this implies $\int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{\phi_t(A)}\omega$ is independent of $t$ , so in particular $$\int_{A}\omega=\int_{\phi_0(A)}\omega=\int_{\phi_{t_0}(A)}\omega=\int_{-A}\omega,$$ as required. Lemma 2: The conditions in lemma 1 are equivalent to $\int_{C} i_X\omega=0$ for any great circle $C$ and Killing field $X$ . Proof: Let $C$ be a great circle. $C$ bounds a hemisphere $A$ .

Discussion: Let $\tilde \omega$ be the standard round volume. Let $\omega=h\tilde \omega$ be an arbitrary form. $\omega$ is invariant iff $h(x)=h(-x)$ . By looking at a great circle $C$ , we see that the condition in lemma 2 is equivalent to $$ \int_C   h|_{C}(\theta)\sin \theta=0,  \int_C   h|_{C}(\theta)\cos \theta=0.$$ This is because the space of Killing fields on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is $3$ -dimensional, and one non-trivial Killing field always fixes the two hemispheres bounded by $C$ , so we are effectively left with two equations.

Context: Today I saw in class the definition of sectional curvature and I thought that I might check as a self-posed exercise that the Gaussian curvature of a non-degenerate surface in Minkowski space is really given by the ""determinant"" $$K = \frac{\langle {\rm II}(X,X), {\rm II}(Y,Y) \rangle - \langle {\rm II}(X,Y), {\rm II}(Y,X)\rangle }{\langle X,X\rangle\langle Y,Y \rangle - \langle X,Y \rangle^2},$$as in page $118$ of Kühnel's Curves, Surfaces, Manifolds book, where ${\rm II}$ is the vector-valued second fundamental form and $X$ and $Y$ form a basis of the tangent plane to the surface. This always bothered me, so let's get on to it.

(i) The Principal normal is orthogonal to a fixed direction (ii) $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = c$ where $\kappa$ is the curvature, $\omega$ is the torsion, and $c$ is a constant. Now for (i) we prove the necessary condition. If my space curve is a helix, it has parametric equations $x = a \cos \theta$, $y = a \sin \theta$, $z = b\theta$. Assume without loss of generality that $a = 1$ and $b=1$. Then performing calculations I find that the principal normal $\overrightarrow{n} = \langle -\cos \theta, -\sin \theta, 0 \rangle$ which is orthogonal to any vector of the form $\langle 0, 0, a \rangle$, $a$ some constant. For the sufficient condition, suppose $\overrightarrow{n} \cdot \overrightarrow{a} = 0$, $\overrightarrow{a}$ some vector with fixed direction. Then by the frenet- serret formulas, $\frac{d \overrightarrow{T}}{ds} = \kappa \overrightarrow{n}$, and hence taking the dot product with $\overrightarrow{a}$ on both sides gives the equation $\frac{d \overrightarrow{T}}{ds} \cdot \overrightarrow{a} = 0$. $(*)$ Now here's the logic. If $T'(s)$ is perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{a}$, where $T$ is my unit tangent vector, then since $T$ is perpendicular to $T'(s)$ it follows that $T$ itself makes a constant angle with $\overrightarrow{a}$. Is this bit of logic right?? Now for part (ii), the bit on necessity is easy as I just use the same helix and get that $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = 1$. It is just the bit on sufficiency that is difficult. I have no idea how to go from $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = c$ to the fact the tangent vector makes a constant angle to a fixed direction. Please do not give me any full answers for the last bit, but instead pose me some questions that my motivate my understanding of the problem. Edit: Proof of the neccesary condition for (i).

There are parts of the hypothesis and proof that have nothing to do with where I'm stuck, so in the interests of brevity, I'll give only the part I'm having trouble with. We are given $M$ , an immersed submanifold with or without boundary in $\mathbb{R}^n$ , and $D$ , a smooth rank- $k$ subbundle of $T\mathbb{R}^n|_M$ . The proof begins as follows: Let $p\in M$ be arbitrary, and let $(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ be a smooth local frame for $D$ over some neighborhood $V$ of $p$ in $M$ . Because immersed submanifolds are locally embedded, by shrinking $V$ if necessary, we may assume that it is a single slice in some coordinate ball or half-ball $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ . Since $V$ is closed in $U$ , Proposition 8.11(c) shows that we can complete $(X_1,\dots,X_k)$ to a smooth local frame $(\tilde{X}_1,\dots,\tilde{X}_n)$ for $T\mathbb{R}^n$ over $U$ , ... My problem lies wholly within the above three sentences. The first sentence is fine. The second sentence starts out fine, but I don't think there is such a thing as a coordinate half-ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$ since $\mathbb{R}^n$ has empty boundary. (Please correct me if I'm wrong here.) So I am going to assume that Professor Lee meant to say ""assume that it is a single slice or half-slice of some coordinate ball $U\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ ."" With that change (which doesn't solve my problem), I am OK with the second sentence and with $V$ being closed in $U$ . Now Proposition 8.11(c) applies to smooth vector fields along a closed subset $V\subseteq U$ . For my question, I only need to talk about one of the $X_i$ , so let me just call it $X$ . I have no problem composing $X$ with smooth maps and restricting codomains so that, I can consider $X$ to be a smooth vector field $X\colon V\to TU$ over $V$ . Recall that $V$ is a neighborhood in $M$ and as such has a smooth structure of manifold with (possibly empty) boundary derived from that of $M$ . Now let me quote the definition of a smooth vector field along a subset (I've changed the names of the variables to match the present situation): If $U$ is a smooth manifold with or without boundary and $V\subseteq U$ is an arbitrary subset, a vector field along $V$ is a continuous map $X\colon V\to TU$ satisfying $\pi\circ X=\mathrm{Id}_V$ . We call it a smooth vector field along $V$ if for each $q\in V$ , there is a neighborhood $W$ of $q$ in $U$ and a smooth vector field $\tilde{X}$ on $W$ that agrees with $X$ on $W\cap V$ . My problem is that given $q\in V$ , I haven't been able to find a neighborhood $W$ of $q$ in $U$ and an associated smooth vector field $\tilde{X}$ on $W$ such that $X|_{W\cap V}=\tilde{X}|_{W\cap V}$ . I've got $(U,\phi)$ , a smooth chart centered at $p$ for $\mathbb{R}^n$ , with $\phi(U)$ being the open cube of side $r$ centered at $0_{\mathbb{R}^n}$ and with $\phi(V)=\phi(U)\cap(Z^m\times\{0_{\mathbb{R}^{n-m}}\})$ where $m=\mathrm{dim}\,M$ , and $Z=\mathbb{H}$ if $p\in\partial M$ and $Z=\mathbb{R}$ otherwise. I think I can make things work if $p$ is not a boundary point of $M$ as follows: Let $F\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be defined by $$F(x_1,\dots,x_m,x_{m+1},\dots,x_n)=(x_1,\dots,x_m,0,\dots,0).$$ Then $F$ is smooth, and when applying $F$ to $\phi(U)$ , it produces $\phi(U)\cap(\mathbb{R}^m\times\{0_{\mathbb{R}^{n-m}}\})=\phi(V)$ . Thus $\tilde{X}=X\circ\phi^{-1}\circ F\circ\phi\colon U\to TU$ is smooth and equals $X$ on $V$ . [EDIT: As pointed out by Tob Ernack, this may be smooth, and may be an extension, but it is not a section and therefore not a solution for the empty boundary case. So I retract the statement that I know how to make it work at an interior point.] But this won't work when $p\in\partial M$ since then $Z=\mathbb{H}$ and $F(\phi(U))=\phi(U)\cap(\mathbb{R}^m\times\{0_{\mathbb{R}^{n-m}}\})$ which is not equal to $\phi(V)=\phi(U)\cap(\mathbb{H}^m\times\{0_{\mathbb{R}^{n-m}}\})$ and therefore cannot be composed with $X\circ\phi^{-1}$ .

81,How is the sheafy De Rham cohomology functorial?,How is the sheafy De Rham cohomology functorial?,,"$\newcommand{\T}{\mathscr{T}}\newcommand{\C}{\mathscr{C}^\infty}$ I've been enjoying Iversen's book on sheaf cohomology. He briefly mentions De Rham cohomology and a sheafy perspective on it but he doesn't mention if the canonical isomorphism is functorial; everyone says that it is, but with the sheaf perspective I'm not so sure. It's not been clear to me or people I've talked to how to even define sheafy De Rham cohomology as a functor. To explain the problem I need to explain his definition first. Let ""smooth manifold"" mean the usual but emphasise second-countable, Hausdorff and being without boundary (the latter for convenience and the first two because we need our manifolds to be $\sigma$ -compact). All sheaves and sheaf morphisms considered will be of $\Bbb R$ -sheaves. For a smooth manifold $X$ , let $\C_X$ denote the sheaf of smooth $\Bbb R$ -valued functions. Let $\T_X$ denote the tangential sheaf; this is the sheaf with sections $\T_X(U)$ the vector space of all sheaf morphisms $\phi:\C_X|_U\to\C_X|_U$ with the property that for all open $V\subseteq U$ , $\phi_V:\C_X(V)\to\C_X(V)$ is a derivation of $\Bbb R$ -algebras. The sheaf action is defined by obvious restriction, and it is obviously a true sheaf. Now for $p\ge0$ let $\Omega_X^p$ denote the De Rham sheaf, the ""sheafy"" notion of differential forms. This is the sheaf on $X$ with sections $\Omega^p_X(U)$ defined as the vector space of alternating morphisms of $\C_X|_U$ -modules: $$\omega:\T_X|_U\otimes_{\C_X|_U}\T_X|_U\otimes_{\C_X|_U}\cdots\otimes_{\C_X|_U}\T_X|_U\to\C_X|_U$$ Where $p$ sheaf tensor products are taken. The exterior derivative may be defined in the usual way and we have a complex of sheaves $\Omega^\bullet_X$ and an obvious injection $\underline{\Bbb R}\to\Omega^\bullet_X$ . It can be argued with a local bump function perspective that this is a complex of soft sheaves, and since $X$ is $\sigma$ -compact and LCH this means soft sheaves are acyclic for cohomology (as well as compactly supported cohomology). Then standard arguments involving finding a basis for forms on $\Bbb R^n$ and getting antiderivatives find that $\Omega^\bullet_X$ is a resolution of $\underline{\Bbb R}$ (exact iff. exact on stalks). By abstract nonsense we conclude $H^\bullet(X;\Bbb R)\cong H^\bullet_{dR}(X)$ and $H^\bullet_C(X;\Bbb R)\cong H^\bullet_{dR,C}(X)$ . Now my question is: with this sheafy perspective on $H^\bullet_{dR}$ , how is it a functor ? Because I would obviously want the sheaf theory to produce a natural isomorphism between the two theories. I know this should be possible since the high and mighty speak of this e.g. Clausen refers to (some similar variant of) sheafy De Rham cohomology as a functor, but doesn't explain how that actually works. I don't know if Iversen's formulation (the presentation of which I've also slightly tweaked) is standard or not. Classically if I have a smooth $f:X\to Y$ it's very easy to define the derivative $df$ ""pointwise"". If you have a derivation $D:\C(f^{-1}(W))\to\Bbb R$ you promote it to one $\C(W)\to\Bbb R$ just by assigning $g\mapsto D(g\circ f)$ , for any open subset $W$ of $Y$ . However Iversen's formulation is founded on vector fields, rather than tangent vectors. Looking around, we can't generally perform a similar construction for pushing forward vector fields; if I have a section $\phi$ of $\T_X(f^{-1}(W))$ , I can define a derivation $\C(W)\to\C(f^{-1}(W))$ by precomposition again but I can't push that to something $\C(W)\to\C(W)$ . Ideally I should have a sheafy derivative $df:f_\ast\T_X\to\T_Y$ , or $\T_X\to f^\ast\T_Y$ or $\T_Y\to f_\ast\T_X$ or whatever the correct variance should be, but I'm struggling to get anything. And then of course if I don't have a derivative I don't have a hope of defining a pullback-of-forms map $\Omega_Y^p\to f_\ast\Omega_X^p$ . And that's what I really need; it can be shown that $f^\ast:H^\bullet(Y;\Bbb R)\to H^\bullet(X;\Bbb R)$ would be computable by (the global sections of) any chain map $F:\Omega^\bullet_Y\to f_\ast\Omega_X^\bullet$ which, in degree zero, equals the precomposition map $f^\ast:\C_Y\to f_\ast\C_X$ .

93,Poincaré hyperbolic geodesics in half-plane and disc models including outer branch,Poincaré hyperbolic geodesics in half-plane and disc models including outer branch,,"The objective of this post is to state that: 1) the Poincaré  hyperbolic metric results in a solution of complete geodesic circles in both half-plane and disk models. 2) the choice of one or other is quite arbitrary. 3) while for the half plane model negative side arbitrariness provides no new solution or insight, the disc model hyperbolic geodesic proposed outside the horizon/boundary can be validated in full. EDIT1: The derivation of geodesics of the two models follows in a straightforward  manner from the metric. For the half-plane we have in Cartesian coordinates $$ ds^2 = (dx^2 + dy^2)/y^2  \tag{1} $$ Employing Euler-Lagrange (from calculus of variations approach )(primes wrt x) $$ s = \int \dfrac{\sqrt{ 1 + y^{'2}}}{ y } dx,\,\tag{2}  $$ the functional is $$ F =\dfrac{\sqrt{ 1 + y^{'2}}} { y } \tag{3}$$ $$ F - y^{'}\dfrac {\partial F }{ \partial y^{'} }  = 1/c  \tag{4}  $$ where c is an arbitrary constant leading  to (since $ y^{'}= \tan\phi,$ $\phi =$ inclination to x-axis), $$ \cos \phi = \frac{y}{c} \tag{5}  $$ $$ \frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{\sqrt{c^2-y^2}}{y} \tag 6 $$ Let $ y^2= v,\, 2y dy = dv $ Integrating $$-2 \sqrt{c^2-v} = 2x-2h \tag7$$ where $2h$ is an integration constant. $$ (x-h)^2 + y^2 = c^2 \tag8 $$ which are all all full circles centered on x-axis and lying on either side of x-axis. Argument about distances. Whether we approach from below the x-axis or from above, x-axis is at an infinite distance so lower symmetric half part may have been excluded (by Poincaré). Distance to points on x-axis is infinite whether we take the upper half or the lower, it appears to be entirely arbitrary. I.e, either of them could serve as a valid geodesic model. But **the disc model has no such direct reflective symmetry, but possesses definitely an ""inversion symmetry"" arising from same metric  **. Similarly for the disc in Polar coordinates (primes with respect to $\theta $ ) we land into a situation for an arbitrarily forced choice of range. $$ s = \int \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } d\theta,\, \tag{9} $$ Where $T$ is a more convenient symbol for the radius of fundamental circle than unity as we shall see.. $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } - \dfrac{ r{'}}  {( T^2- r^2)  }  \cdot \dfrac{r^{'}}  {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}} = C_1 \tag{10} $$ and after error indicated by $A.\Gamma.$ corrected it leads to $$ \frac{r^2}{T^2-r^2}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+r'^2}}=C_1.\tag{11} $$ Using substitutions of (12) and (14) we get Equation (15) that is an ODE of product of segments constant property for an entire circle . At tangential point $T$ where $\psi =0,  \pi $ we have the horizon/boundary circle $r=T.$ which  are orthogonal red trajectories to unit ""horizon"" circles obtained by integrating this ODE. However they are these orthogonal hyperbolic geodesic circles on either side of the horizon or boundary. It is well known that the half plane model is a special case of disc model where unit disc radius tends to $ \infty$ . Why Poincaré had deemed the portion of the red circle lying  outside the horizon as not belonging to $ \mathbb H^2 $ .. is to me not clear, so the question here. EDIT 2: ( .. In response to (since deleted) workaholic's request for showing the above to be hyperbolic geodesics by integration) Instead of integrating an eccentric circle in polar coordinates (8) can be differentiated to directly obtain pure formula of curvature in polar coordinates in $\mathbb R^2$ . $$ \kappa_g = \dfrac{r^2 + 2 r^{'2 }- r r ^{''}}{{(r^2 +  r^{'2}})^{3/2}} = 2 C_1 $$ Direct integration is needlessly cumbersome and when direct methods are yielding the result readily. A second way is the following. In the diagram above let $$ OT =1=T, K=-1/T^2, MCB =\psi, OA =r, BC =a ,..$$ $$ AM = MB = a \sin \psi, C_1 = 1/(2 a)\tag{12}$$ where $a$ is another convenient arbitrary constant. Note that the central circle has a radius $=T$ which is tangent to all arbitrary circles of radius $a$ . If inversion circle/mirroring circle has radius $T,$ the inner hyperbolic geodesics are inversions of outer geodesic circles (and vice-versa)  now brought into picture. $$ \dfrac{r}{T^2-r^2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 + u^2 }} = \dfrac{1}{2 a} \tag{13} $$ where by geometry of differential right triangle $$ u = \cot \psi = \dfrac{dr} {r d \theta }\tag{14} $$ $$ 2 a r \sin \psi = T^2 - r^2 $$ $$ r ( r+ 2 a \sin \psi) = T^2 \tag{15}$$ $$ OA \cdot OB = OT^2 = T^2 \tag{16}$$ which relation is readily recognized as the Circle property that product $T^2$ of the two cutting segments on circle is square of tangent $T$ or its power . Alternately in a third method we can get the above into Liouville's form for $2D$ curvature by differentiation with respect to arc and simplifying: $$ \psi^{'} + \dfrac{\sin \psi}{r} = \dfrac{1}{a}  \tag{17} $$ Yet a fourth way to compute geodesics from Poincaré metric (9) is to take the object function for geodesic $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } \,\tag{18}$$ and apply Euler-Lagrange theorem of calculus of variations $$ \dfrac{\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{ (T^2-r^2) } - \dfrac{ r{'}}  {( T^2- r^2)  }  \cdot \dfrac{r^{'}}  {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}} = 1/2a \tag{19}  $$ where wlog the constant is taken as reciprocal of diameter $2a.$ Simplifying, $$ \dfrac{r}{ (T^2-r^2) } =\dfrac {\sqrt{ r^2 + r^{'2}}}{2a} \tag {20}$$ Since in differential form we can plug in from (14) $$ \cot \psi= \dfrac {r^{'}}{r} \tag {21} $$ (20) simplifies to an eccentric circle radius $a$ and power $T$ which is the arbitrary hyperbolic geodesic: $$ \dfrac{\sin \psi}{r}= \dfrac{1}{2a}\cdot \dfrac{r^2-T^2}{r^2} \tag {22} $$ BTW, the name geodesic has been introduced by Liouville. External geodesics mentioned here are inversions of internal geodesics with respect the boundary of unit radius horizon circle as mirror of inversion. $$ r_{outer geodesic} \rightarrow T^2/ r_{inner geodesic} \tag {23} $$ Thus we have circles of arbitrary radius $a$ orthogonally cutting $T$ radius  as valid Poincaré disk model in $ \mathbb H^2 $ on either side of the boundary circle which is hence no truncated geodesic arc in this sense, considered  from Poincaré's defining metric. Either side/segment is equally valid. All points outside the horizon are at an infinite distance to the horizon along the given external geodesics $TQB$ as well.

If it helps, I can assume that I have a framing of the normal bundles of $N_i$ in $M$.",,"['differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

97,What is the intuition behind the Lie derivative of a vector field.,What is the intuition behind the Lie derivative of a vector field.,,"We have the following two formula about the Lie derivative of a vector field: $$ \left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}T\varphi_{-t}\cdot Y_{\varphi_t(p)}=[X,Y]_p = (\mathcal{L}_XY)(p) $$ where $\varphi=\varphi^X(t,p)$ is the flow along the vector field $X$, and equivalently, $$ \mathcal{L}_XY=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}(\varphi_t^{-X})^*Y $$ where $(\varphi_t^{-X})^*$ is the pull-back of $\varphi_t^{-X}$.

98,Variational field on $S^n$,Variational field on,S^n,"This is my first post/question here, so I hope that I do everything right... I'm currently preparing for an exam and therefore trying to solve this exercise: Let $p\in S^n$ and $v \in T_p S^n$. Compute the geodesic through $p$ with initial direction $v$. Write down variations of it and compute the corresponding variational field. Conclude that $S^n $ has constant sectional curvature $1$. I tried the following: The geodesic is given by $$\gamma (t)= \exp_p tv.$$ A variation of this geodesic could look something like this: $$f(s,t) = \exp_p t v(s),$$ where $v(0)=v$, $v'(0)=w$ and $|v|=1$. The variational field is: $$V(t)=\frac{\partial f }{\partial s}(0,t)=(d\exp_p)_{tv}(tw).$$ For calculating the sectional curvature I tried to use the formula for the second variation $$\frac{1}{2}E''(0)=0=-\int_0^\pi \left\langle V, \frac{D^2V}{dt^2}+R(\gamma',V)\gamma '\right\rangle ~dt,$$ where the left side is zero because $f(s,t)$ is a geodesic for all $s$. I then tried to show, that $\left\langle V, \frac{D^2V}{dt^2}\right\rangle=-1$ (i.e. $\frac{D^2V}{dt^2}=-V$) because then i would get $\langle V,R(\gamma',V)\gamma\rangle =1$ . But I didn't manage to do this... (I did it for $S^2$ using the Christoffel symbols and got the desired result) Is everything I did up to this point correct? And if so, how can I continue from here?
