0,Hilbert polynomial of the graph and boundedness of Hom scheme?,Hilbert polynomial of the graph and boundedness of Hom scheme?,,"Let $X,Y$ be two projective variety over an algebraically closed field, then we know $Hom(X,Y)$ has a scheme structure by considering the embedding as a open subscheme of $Hilb(X\times Y)$ using the graph.

Let $I\subset\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ be the ideal defined by $$I:=(p).$$ My approach is to show that $$\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/I,$$ is an integral domain and, hence, $I$ prime ideal or equivalently here, $p$ is irreducible. Let us consider a ring homomorphism $$\varphi:\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]\to\mathbb{C}[t_1,t_2]$$ $$\begin{cases}x\mapsto t_1^2t_2 \\ y\mapsto t_1^2 \\ z \mapsto t_2^2. \end{cases}$$ Notice that, since $\varphi$ is a ring homomorphism, $$\varphi(p)=\varphi(x^2-y^2z)=\varphi(x^2)-\varphi(y^2)\varphi(z)=t_1^4t_2^2-t_1^4t_2^2=0.$$ Here is a claim, which I think is true (it atleast feels like it), but I don't know how to prove it. My argument relies on this: Claim: Any polynomial $f\in\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ can be written as $$f(x,y,z)=f_0(y,z)+xf_1(y,z)+(x^2-y^2z)g(x,y,z).$$ I read on another link that, for any $f(x,y)\in \mathbb{C}[x,y]$ , we can write $$f(x,y)=f_0(x)+yf_1(x)+(x^3-y^2)g(x,y).$$ My approach is inspired by the above identity. $$\text{ }$$ It feels like my claim should be true, since $f_0(y,z)$ takes care of all expressions of the form $\sum_{k=0}^m\sum_{j=0}^nx^0y^jz^k$ and $xf_1(y,z)$ takes care of everything of the form $\sum_{k=0}^m\sum_{j=0}^nx^1y^jz^k$ . Lastly, we have $x^2g(x,y,z)$ which feels like it should take care of any polynomial $$\sum_{k=0}^m\sum_{j=0}^n\sum_{l=2}^o x^ly^jz^k\quad (o \text{ was quite ugly to use in the summation, but anyway)},$$ so I don't really understand what's so special  with the $$-y^2zg(x,y,z)-\text{part},$$ it feels like it doesn't really contribute, or restrict, the polynomial $f$ in any way. So it feels like you could do a similar construction for any polynomial. But probably not. $\text{ }$ My questions now is: Is my claim true? If it is, could you please tell me why? Continuing on the actual problem: Thus, applying $\varphi$ on $f\in\ker\varphi$ gives us $$\varphi(f)=\varphi(f_0)+\varphi(x)\varphi(f_1)+\varphi(x^2-y^2z)\varphi(g)$$ $$=f_0(t_1^2,t_2^2)+t_1^2t_2f_1(t_1^2,t_2^2)=0$$ $$\Rightarrow f_0=f_1=0,$$ Where the last implication holds since $f_0(t_1^2,t_2^2)$ is of even degree while $t_1^2t_2f_1(t_1^2,t_2^2)$ is of odd degree. Hence the only case the sum can be $0$ is if $f_0$ and $f_1$ are identically $0$ . This shows us that $\ker\varphi=I$ . By the first isomorphism theorem, we have $$\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/I\cong \operatorname{im}(\varphi).$$ But this shows us that $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]/I$ is a subring of the integral domain $\mathbb{C}[t_1,t_2]$ .

EDIT -- For context, this is exercise 2.8 in Algebraic Geomtery I: Schemes, with examples and exercises by Ulrich Görtz and Torsten Wedhorn Update : I believe that I have come up with a correct proof that I am posting below for future users to reference. Please let me know if there are errors that I haven't caught. Proof. Let $Z$ be a nonempty (this condition is necessary, as the $\emptyset = X \cap \emptyset$ clearly doesn't contain any generic points) locally closed irreducible subset of $X.$ As $Z$ is locally closed, it is the intersection of an open subsetset $V(\mathfrak a)^c$ and a closed subsetset $V(\mathfrak b)$ of $X.$ Since $Z$ is nonempty, we have that $\mathfrak a \not\subseteq \mathfrak b.$ Hence it suffices to show that $\mathfrak b$ is prime.This would clearly make $x_\mathfrak b \in Z$ the unique generic point. To this end we note that those subsets $V$ of $Z$ which  are of the form $F\cap V(\mathfrak a)^c,$ where $F\subseteq V(\mathfrak b)$ is closed are closed in $Z.$ That $Z$ is irreducible implies $V(\mathfrak b)$ is as well. As $V(\mathfrak b)$ is closed by assumption, we conclude that $\mathfrak b$ is prime.","Here $A$ is a commutative ring. I am confused about the problem statement. I believe that the question is referring to a generic point of $Z.$ This would correspond to a minimal prime ideal of $A$ contained in $Z.$ However, since $Z$ is irreducible, it is of the form $Z = V(\mathfrak p) :=\left\{x \in X: \mathfrak p \subseteq \mathfrak p_x \subseteq A\right\}$ for a prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $A.$ It seems that $\mathfrak p$ would be the unique generic point of $Z.$ My concern is that I haven't used the locally closed condition anywhere, so I suspect there is an error in my reasoning. I believe that I am somehow misunderstanding the problem statement. Could anyone shed some light on this?

Can  be extended to a morphism ?,f:X\dashrightarrow Y f f:X\to Y,"I use the following definition for a variety: Let $k$ be a fixed field (not necessarily algebraically closed), then a scheme $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is called a variety if $X$ is integral, and the structure morphism $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is separated and of finite type. We say that a variety $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is projective if we can consider $X$ as a closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ for some $n$, i.e. if we can factor $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ as $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}_k^n\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ for some $n$. Now, my intuition about rational maps is that they fail to be ordinary maps when they have some sort of ""singularity"", and intuitively, this isn't the case when the target scheme is projective. This is my (incomplete) work so far: Let $U\subseteq X$ be some nonempty open and let $f:U\to Y$ be a morphism of varieties. Now, if we can extend $U\to Y\to\mathbb{P}^n$ to some morphism $g:X\to\mathbb{P}^n$, then since $g(U)\subseteq Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$, then $$g(X) = g(\overline{U})\subseteq \overline{g(U)} = \overline{Y} = Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$$ so that we can factor $g$ through $Y$, and therefore we may replace $Y$ with $\mathbb{P}^n$. Now, given a map $f:U\to\mathbb{P}^n$ with $U\subseteq X$, then it suffices to show that if $X$ is affine, then $f$ can be uniquely extended to $X$, because in that case, we can simply cover by affine opens and glue uniquely. Furthermore, we can assume that $U$ is a distinguished open $D(f)$. Therefore, we have reduced to the following theorem: Let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I)$ be an affine variety over $k$, let $f\in k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I$ be some nonzero element, and let $f:X\vert_{D(f)}\to\mathbb{P}^n$ be a morphism of $k$-varieties, then $f$ can be extended uniquely to a morphism $g:X\to\mathbb{P}^n$ of $k$-varieties.

Are there any examples that can help illustrate why this is true or false?","I use the following definition for a variety: Let $k$ be a fixed field (not necessarily algebraically closed), then a scheme $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is called a variety if $X$ is integral, and the structure morphism $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is separated and of finite type. We say that a variety $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ is projective if we can consider $X$ as a closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ for some $n$, i.e. if we can factor $X\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ as $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}_k^n\to\operatorname{Spec}k$ for some $n$. Now, my intuition about rational maps is that they fail to be ordinary maps when they have some sort of ""singularity"", and intuitively, this isn't the case when the target scheme is projective. This is my (incomplete) work so far: Let $U\subseteq X$ be some nonempty open and let $f:U\to Y$ be a morphism of varieties. Now, if we can extend $U\to Y\to\mathbb{P}^n$ to some morphism $g:X\to\mathbb{P}^n$, then since $g(U)\subseteq Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$, then $$g(X) = g(\overline{U})\subseteq \overline{g(U)} = \overline{Y} = Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$$ so that we can factor $g$ through $Y$, and therefore we may replace $Y$ with $\mathbb{P}^n$. Now, given a map $f:U\to\mathbb{P}^n$ with $U\subseteq X$, then it suffices to show that if $X$ is affine, then $f$ can be uniquely extended to $X$, because in that case, we can simply cover by affine opens and glue uniquely. Furthermore, we can assume that $U$ is a distinguished open $D(f)$. Therefore, we have reduced to the following theorem: Let $X = \operatorname{Spec}(k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I)$ be an affine variety over $k$, let $f\in k[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I$ be some nonzero element, and let $f:X\vert_{D(f)}\to\mathbb{P}^n$ be a morphism of $k$-varieties, then $f$ can be extended uniquely to a morphism $g:X\to\mathbb{P}^n$ of $k$-varieties. However, I'm at a loss for how to prove this. Are there any examples that can help illustrate why this is true or false?",,['algebraic-geometry']
