17,Can a field with cardinality $3$ be an ordered field?,Can a field with cardinality  be an ordered field?,3,"This is the question I'm confused about: Consider a field $F = \{0,1,a\}$ with exactly 3 elements. Can it be an ordered field? Explain your answer in all details. Well obviously, if $F$ is a field, then as $a$ is an element of $F$, $a + a$ also has to be in the field. So I thought that $2a = 1$, since if $2a = 0$ or $2a = a$, then $a = 0$, which is contradictory to the statement that the field has exactly 3 elements. Then it's concluded that $a = 1/2$, but if that's true, $1 + 1/2 = 3/2$ also has to be in this field, but it's not. Therefore I concluded that it can't be an ordered field. But something seems so wrong about my solution.

18,Homogeneous Isotropic Riemannian Manifolds,Homogeneous Isotropic Riemannian Manifolds,,"In John Lee's book Riemannian Manifolds on page 33, Lee writes ""Clearly a homogeneous Riemannian manifold that is isotropic at one point is isotropic at every point"". It seems that he means that he concluded this from the following argument:  Suppose a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is isotropic at $p \in M$ and homogeneous, and take $q \in M$, $v, w \in T_q M$ with $g_q(v, v) = g_q(w, w) = 1$.  Because $M$ is homogeneous, there is a Lie group $G$ that acts smoothly and transitively on $M$ by isometries, so we can find $x \in G$ such that $x \cdot q = p$, hence $x_* v, x_*w \in T_qM$.  Because $M$ is isotropic at $p$, there exists another Lie Group $H$ acting on $M$ smoothly by isometries such that the isotropy subgroup $H_p \subseteq H$ acts transitively on $T_pM$, so there exists $y \in H$ such that $y_*(x_* v) = x_* w$.  We would then have $(x^{-1}yx)_*v = w$ as desired.  However, Lee does not specify in the definitions of homogeneity and isotropy that $G, H$ have to be the same Lie group, so I am not sure why there is a Lie group acting smoothly by isometries on $M$ that contains all elements of the form $x^{-1}yx$, where $x \in G$, $y \in H$. I do not want to use the fact that the isometry group of any Riemannian manifold can be made into a Lie group, since this fact is beyond the scope of this chapter, and is supposedly pretty difficult to prove.  One solution I was thinking of was maybe using a coproduct (free product) of the Lie groups $G, H$, but I was not sure how to give this a topology or smooth structure.

Does this concept have a name? So naturally, I am wondering if any elements can be ""deleted"" in this manner from $\mathbb{R}$. I realized that for $\alpha=\sqrt{2}$, there is no such field $E$ such that $E(\alpha)=\mathbb{R}$. If there was, there would be $a,b \in E$ such that $2^{1/4}=a+b\sqrt{2}$ as $\mathbb{R}$ is an extension of $E$ and the fourth root is in $\mathbb{R}$. Squaring, and with some algebra (being careful with avoiding division by zero), one gets the contradiction that $\sqrt{2} \in E$. I haven't thought this through carefully, but I believe for any algebraic number we have a similar failure. That is, there is a polynomial of degree $n$, $p \in E(x)$, with $p(\alpha)=0$. Then in particular $\alpha^{1/k} = p_k(\alpha)$ for $p_k$ of degree $n$. Raising to the $k$th power we get $\alpha = q_k(\alpha)$ for $q_k$ polynomial of degree $n$. This gives a linear system in $\alpha^k$ and my hunch it is nonsingular or the singular cases can be dealt with. The above is for algebraic numbers. I think the above can be used to show, for instance, that $\pi$ cannot work as it is likely algebraic over $E$ as $E$ contains many transcendental numbers. This is much more murky to me but makes me think that there is no element you can delete from $\mathbb{R}$. So my question: Does there exist $\alpha \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ and a field $F \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $F(\alpha)=\mathbb{R}$? More specifically, I want $F$ with $\alpha \notin F$.","I was thinking what would be the opposite of a field extension and I suppose it might be this: A field $F$ can have the element $\alpha$ deleted if there exists a subfield $E=F$ such that $E(\alpha)=F$. You might call $F\setminus(\alpha)$ something like a deletion. The thing about this is that you can then undo any field extension. That is, $F(\alpha) \setminus (\alpha)=F$.

93,Show that $f(x) = x^p -x -1 \in \Bbb{F}_p[x]$ is irreducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ for every $p$.,Show that  is irreducible over  for every .,f(x) = x^p -x -1 \in \Bbb{F}_p[x] \Bbb{F}_p p,"Let $p$ be a prime. a) Show that $f$ has no roots in $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Let $F^*$ be the multiplicative group of $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Then, by lagrange's thoerem for all nonzero $\alpha \in \Bbb{F}_p$ , $\alpha^{p-1} = 1 \implies \alpha^p=\alpha \implies \alpha^p-\alpha=0$ . Of course $0^p=0$ , so this is true for all elements of $F$ and not just the nonzero ones. But then $\alpha^p - \alpha - 1 = -1$ for all $\alpha \in \Bbb{F}_p$ and so it must have no roots in $\Bbb{F}_p$ . I could have also done this using the Frobenius automorphism, right? b) Let $\alpha$ be a root of $f$ (in some algebraic closure of $\Bbb{F}_p$ ). Show that $\alpha + s$ is also a root for all $s \in \Bbb{F}_p$ . Let $\alpha^p - \alpha -1 =0$ . Let $E$ be an algebraic closure of $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Since $E$ has characteristic $p$ , $(\alpha + s)^p = \alpha^p + s^p$ . So we have, $$(\alpha + s)^p - (\alpha + s) -1 = \alpha^p + s^p - \alpha -s -1 = s^p - s = 0.$$ c) Conclude that $f$ is irreducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ , for every $p$ . By b) and the fact that $\Bbb{F}_p$ has $p$ distinct elements, we know that the roots of $f$ are $\alpha, \alpha+1, ... , \alpha + p-1$ . So if $K$ is a splitting field, we have $$x^p - x -1 = (x-\alpha)(x-(\alpha+1))...(x-(\alpha+p-1)).$$ Now let's assume that $f$ is reducible over $\Bbb{F}_p$ . Then $f=gh$ for some $g$ and $h$ with degrees less than that of $f$ . So $g$ and $h$ must be of the form $(x-(\alpha+s_1))...(x-(\alpha+s_k))$ where k is less than n. Let's say that g has degree 2, because the other cases are similar. So $g =(x-(\alpha + s_i))(x-(\alpha + s_j))$ and the constant term for $g$ is, $$(\alpha + s_i)(\alpha + s_j) = \alpha^2 + s_is_j\alpha + s_is_j.$$ Since $\Bbb{F}_p$ is a field, if $\alpha s_is_j$ is an element of $\Bbb{F}_p$ , then so is $((\frac{1}{s_is_j})(\alpha s_is_j) = \alpha$ , a contradiction. We can show by induction that if we multiply $(x-(\alpha+s_1))...(x-(\alpha+s_k)$ , we get a term that looks like $s_1s_2...s_k\alpha$ . So this is also true for $k>2$ .
