Assume $X$ is complete , i.e, the flow of $X$ is defined on whole $\mathbb{R} \times M$. I wonder what happens to the flow when $X$ is multiplied by some real positive function  $f \in C^{\infty}(M)$. My guess is that the flow will still be defined for any time, and that it will be a reparametrization of the original flow. (i.e only the speed may change). In particular $fX$ will be complete. Question: Is this guess correct? Does it hold for non-compact manifolds? (Note I assume anyway $X$ is complete) Update: As shown by Travis, when $M$ is non-compact, the scaled field need not be complete. Of course, when $M$ is compact, than any vector field is complete. For the compact case, I am still interested to know if there is a global smoothly changing reparametrization $h:\mathbb{R} \times M \to \mathbb{R} $ such that $\psi(t,p)=\phi(h(t,p),p) \forall t \in \mathbb{R} , p \in M$? My analysis (below) shows that if there is such a reparametrization than it's unique (since it's enough to prove uniqueness locally), but I do not know how to show there exists such a global $h$. (See my analysis for details about where my ""procedure"" gets stuck). My analysis so far: Let $\phi_p(t)=\phi(t,p)$ denote the $t$-time flow of $X$ from $p \in M$, i.e $(1)\,\, \phi: \R \times M \to M \, , \, \dot \phi_p(t)=X(\phi_p(t))$ Take $Y = fX$. Denote the flow of $Y$ by $\psi_p(t)$. Assume there exists a real function $h_p:\R \to \R$ such that $\psi_p(t)=\phi_p(h_p(t))$. Then $\dot \psi_p(t)=Y(\psi_p(t)) \Rightarrow \dot \phi_p(h_p(t))\cdot h_p'(t)=f(\psi_p(t)) \cdot X(\psi_p(t))$ So by $(1)$ we get: $$X(\psi_p(t)) \cdot h_p'(t)=X\Big(\phi_p\big(h_p(t)\big)\Big)\cdot h_p'(t)=f(\psi_p(t)) \cdot X(\psi_p(t))$$ So if $ X(\psi_p(t)) \neq 0$, this forces $h_p'(t)=f(\psi_p(t))=f\Big(\phi_p\big(h_p(t)\big)\Big)$ This motivates we try to analyze the following equation, $\forall p \in M$: $$(2) \,\, h_p(0)=0,h_p'(t)=f\Big(\phi_p\big(h_p(t)\big)\Big)$$ We now change notations: Define $h:\R \times M \to \R$ via: $h(t,p)=h_p(t)$. Denote $\til M = \R \times M$, and consider the hypersurface $S = \{0\} \times M \subseteq \til M$.  then $(2)$ becomes: $$(3) \, \, h|_S=0, \pd{}{t} h = (f \circ \phi) \big(h(t,p),p\big)$$ The vector field $\pd{}{t} \in \Ga\brk{T \til \M}$ is nowhere tangent to $S$ (since $T_{\brk{0,p}}S=0 \oplus T_p\M$ and $\pd{}{t}(t,p)=(1,0)$). Denote $C^\infty\brk{\til M \times \R} \ni \til f: \til M \times \R \to \R$ via the formula: $$\til f((t,p),s) = (f \circ \phi)(s,p) $$, then $(3)$ becomes: $$ (4) \, \,  h|_S=0, \pd{}{t} h = \til f \big((t,p),h(t,p)\big)$$ The above equation is an instance of a Quasilinear Cauchy problem (on the manifold $\til M$), so we know $\forall \til p=(0,p) \in S$ there exists a unique solution in some neighbourhood $U$ of $\til p$. (See for instance Theorem 9.53, page 242 in John M.Lee's book ""Introduction to smooth manifolds"") In the case $M$ is compact, we can proceed in the following way: $\forall p \in \M , (0,p) \in S \Rightarrow  (0,p) \in U \Rightarrow$ there exists an open set $\til U_p \subseteq U$ which contains $(0,p)$. Hence, there exists $\ep_p \in \R \, , \, U_p \subseteq \M$ ($U_p$ open in $\M$)  such that $(-\ep_p,\ep_p) \times U_p \subseteq \til U_p$. $\{U_p|p \in \M\}$ form an open cover of $\M$, hence ( by compactness of $M$ ) there is a finite subcover $U_{p_1},\dots ,  U_{p_n}$. Define $\ep = min\{\ep_{p_i}|i=1,\dots,n \}$. It follows immediately that $(-\ep,\ep) \times \M \subseteq U$. So, we have stablished exsitence of a unique solution on $(-\ep,\ep) \times \M$. The problem is how to continue from here. A naive approach is to define  $X = \{t \in I| \text{there exists a unique solution for $(4)$ in  } (-t,t) \times \M \}$. Look at $s= \text{sup} X$. We claim $\text{sup} X \in X$. Since $X$ is closed downward , i.e :  $x \in X \Rightarrow \brk{0 \le x' < x \Rightarrow x' \in X}$ it follows that $[0,s) \subseteq X$. It's easy to see there must be a unique solution for $(4)$ on $(-s,s) \times \M$. (If there were two different solutions, they would differ already at some $s'<s$ which contradicts $[0,s) \subseteq X$). Hence, by continuity, there is at most one solution on $[-s,s] \times \M$. So, if we knew it's possibe to extend the unique solution on $(-s,s) \times \M$ to $[-s,s] \times \M$, then we could advance the (existence and) uniqueness further, via the same argument, thus obtaining a contradiction. (In that case our initial hypersurfaces would have been $\{s\} \times M$,$\{-s\} \times M$). I am not sure how to show the solution can be extended that way. In principle, we can also start the equation from $t=s$ by requiring $h(s,p)$ to satisfy $\psi(s,p)=\phi(h(s,p),p)$. Since non-constant integral curves are injective or periodic, we this might  determine $h_{\{s\} \times M}$ uniquely and perhaps we can continue from there.

Let $f:M \to M$ be a diffeomorphism and suppose that for every (parametrized) geodesic $\gamma$ , $f \circ \gamma$ is also a (parametrized) geodesic. Must $f$ be an isometry? An equivalent condition on $f$ is that $\nabla df=0$ where $\nabla=\nabla^{T^*M} $ $ \otimes \nabla^{f^*TM}$ is the relevant tensor product connection. Note that this equivalent assumption implies that $df$ has constant singular values, and in particular that the Jacobian $\det(df)$ is constant, hence it must be $1$ (since $f$ was assumed to be a diffeomorphism.) Thus $f$ is volume-preserving.

8,Some questions about differential forms,Some questions about differential forms,,"If $A$ is a differential one form then $A\wedge A ..

I guess this anti-commutative nature of wedge product does not work for Lie algebra valued one-forms since tensoring two vectors is not commutative. If the vector space in which the vector valued differential form is taking values is $V$ with a chosen basis ${v_i}$ then books use the notation of $A = \Sigma _{i}  A_i v_i$ where the sum is over the dimension of the vector space and $A_i$ are ordinary forms of the same rank. I would like to know whether this $A_i v_i$ is just a notation for $A_i \otimes v_i$ ? Similarly say $B$ is a vector valued differential form taking values in $W$ with a chosen basis ${w_i}$ and in the same notation, $B = \Sigma _j B_j w_j$. Then the notation used is that, $A \wedge B = \Sigma _{i,j} A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ I wonder if in the above $A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ is just a notation for $A_i \wedge B_j \otimes v_i \otimes w_j$ ? $A$ and $B$ are vector bundle valued differential forms (like say the connection-1-form $\omega$ or the curvature-2-form $\omega$) then how is $Tr(A)$ defined and why is $d(Tr A) = Tr( d A)$ and $Tr(A \wedge B) = Tr(B \wedge A)$ ? Is $A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A = 0$ ? for $A$ being a vector bundle valued $1$-form or is only $Tr(A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A) = 0$ ? If A and B are two vector bundle valued $k$ and $l$ form respectively then one defines $[A,B]$ as , $[A,B] (X_1,..,X_{k+l}) = \frac{1}{(k+l)!} \Sigma _{\sigma \in S_n} (sgn \sigma) [A (X_{\sigma(1)},X_{\sigma(2)},..,X_{\sigma(k)}) , B (X_{\sigma(k+1)},X_{\sigma(k+2)},..,X_{\sigma(k+l)})]$ This means that if say $k=1$ then $[A,A] (X,Y) = [A(X),A(Y)]$ and $[A,A] = 2A \wedge A$.

(more\text{ }than\text{ }2\text{ }times) = 0$ Then how does the $A\wedge A \wedge A$ make sense in the Chern-Simon's form, $Tr(A\wedge dA + \frac{2}{3} A \wedge A \wedge A)$ ? I guess this anti-commutative nature of wedge product does not work for Lie algebra valued one-forms since tensoring two vectors is not commutative. If the vector space in which the vector valued differential form is taking values is $V$ with a chosen basis ${v_i}$ then books use the notation of $A = \Sigma _{i}  A_i v_i$ where the sum is over the dimension of the vector space and $A_i$ are ordinary forms of the same rank. I would like to know whether this $A_i v_i$ is just a notation for $A_i \otimes v_i$ ? Similarly say $B$ is a vector valued differential form taking values in $W$ with a chosen basis ${w_i}$ and in the same notation, $B = \Sigma _j B_j w_j$. Then the notation used is that, $A \wedge B = \Sigma _{i,j} A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ I wonder if in the above $A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ is just a notation for $A_i \wedge B_j \otimes v_i \otimes w_j$ ? $A$ and $B$ are vector bundle valued differential forms (like say the connection-1-form $\omega$ or the curvature-2-form $\omega$) then how is $Tr(A)$ defined and why is $d(Tr A) = Tr( d A)$ and $Tr(A \wedge B) = Tr(B \wedge A)$ ? Is $A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A = 0$ ? for $A$ being a vector bundle valued $1$-form or is only $Tr(A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A) = 0$ ? If A and B are two vector bundle valued $k$ and $l$ form respectively then one defines $[A,B]$ as , $[A,B] (X_1,..,X_{k+l}) = \frac{1}{(k+l)!} \Sigma _{\sigma \in S_n} (sgn \sigma) [A (X_{\sigma(1)},X_{\sigma(2)},..,X_{\sigma(k)}) , B (X_{\sigma(k+1)},X_{\sigma(k+2)},..,X_{\sigma(k+l)})]$ This means that if say $k=1$ then $[A,A] (X,Y) = [A(X),A(Y)]$ and $[A,A] = 2A \wedge A$. The Cartan structure equation states that, $d\Omega = \Omega \wedge \omega - \omega \wedge \Omega$. But some people write this as, $d\Omega = [\Omega,\omega]$. This is not clear to me.

9,Convex boundary of a symplectic manifold,Convex boundary of a symplectic manifold,,"Given a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, suppose that $\partial M$ is of contact type.

Then $\tilde{J} = \psi^*J$ induces a possibly different metric $\tilde{g}$. We have $$\begin{align} \tilde{g}(-,-) = & \rho(-,\tilde{J}-)\\ = & \rho(-,d\psi^{-1}(J\circ\psi)d\psi-)\\ = & ((\psi^{-1})^*\rho)(d\psi-,(J\circ\psi)d\psi-) \end{align}$$ and as $(\psi^{-1})^*\rho$ at $\psi(m)$ is given by $f(\psi(m))\rho_{\psi(m)}$, where $f:\Sigma\to\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is some function, we obtain $$\tilde{g} = \psi^*(fg).$$ I need to find $f$ in function of $\psi$ (as this would allow me, for example, to understand how the curvature changes when we change $J$ by the pullback via a diffeomorphism). Are there known results for this? Any help or hint on how to proceed would be appreciated. Notes: The following things are true in the case I need, but I don't know whether they are useful: The genus of $\Sigma$ is at least $2$.

By geodesically convex we mean each pair of points in $\mathcal B_\epsilon(x)$ can be connected by a unique minimizing geodesic staying within the ball. How to prove that $\text{conv}(x)$ is continuous? First, I wanted to prove upper-semicontinuity: Suppose $\text{conv}(x_n) \ge c$ for a sequence $x_n \to x$ . Pick $y, z \in B_c(x)$ and let $d = \max\{\text{d}(y, x)), \text{d}(z, x)\}$ . Find $n$ large enough so that $\text{d}(x_n, x) < \frac{1}{2}(c' - d)$ for some $c' \in (d, c)$ . Then \begin{align*}   \text{d}(y, x_n) &\le \text{d}(y, x) + \text{d}(x, x_n) < d + \frac{1}{2}(c' - d) = \frac{1}{2}(c' + d) < c', \end{align*} and similarly for $z$ .

47,On defining homology groups,On defining homology groups,,"I have been trying to understand what homology groups are ""talking about,"" and  now I am wondering if the following works as a definition of homology. But first, some illustration of what it is inspired by: if $D\subset\Bbb C$ is a domain it seems elements of $H_1(D)$ can be interpreted as contours to integrate over, considered with orientation (sign) and multiplicity. If $\oint_\gamma f(z)dz=0$ for all of the functions $f\in{\cal O}(D)$ (i.e. holomorphic $f:D\to\Bbb C$) then we treat $\gamma$ as $0$ in $H_1(D)$. Thus, loops are trivial if they can be contracted to a point within the domain $D$. On the other hand, if a loop goes around a punctured point in $D$, there will be holomorphic functions in ${\cal O}(D)$ with a simple pole at the point and integrating such a function over the contour will yield a nonzero value. There are some more relations satisfied by these contours-with-multiplicity. If $-\gamma$ is the same contour as $\gamma$ but traversed in the opposite direction then $\oint_{-\gamma} f(z)dz=-\oint_\gamma f(z)dz$ and hence $\oint_{\gamma+(-\gamma)}f(z)dz=0$ for all $f$, so we may conclude $\gamma+(-\gamma)=0$. And if $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ go around two distinct punctures respectively (and no others) with the same orientation then $\gamma_1+\gamma_2$ is equivalent to any contour that loops around both punctures (but no others) in the same direction. Without loss of generality I think we can consider $H_1(D)$ to be generated by simple loops. To generalize to $n$ dimensions, we need vector calculus and differential forms to replace complex analysis. From what I understand, Stokes' and de Rham's theorems say that elements of homology are oriented domains of integration for differential forms counted with multiplicity. (I have not delved more deeply than this intuitive understanding, though.) In that spirit, I want to define my chain groups $C_n({\cal M})$ as $\Bbb Z$-linear combinations of closed, compact, oriented $n$-dimensional submanifolds, subject to the following two relations: If $\cal A, B$ intersect only on their boundary and $\cal A\cup B$ has a consistent orientation then we identify $\cal A\cup B$ with $A+B$. I believe an equivalent condition is that if $\cal A\cap B\ne\varnothing$ and have the same restricted orientation on $\cal A\cap B$ then $\cal A+B=(A\cup B)+(A\cap B)$. If $\cal C,C'$ are the same submanifold but with opposite orientations, then $\cal C'=-C$. One may take the usual topological boundary (in which orientation is inherited) and extend linearly to obtain the boundary maps $\partial_n:C_n({\cal M})\to C_{n-1}({\cal M})$. Then $\partial^2=0$ and we may define the homology group $H_n({\cal M})$ as generated by the boundaryless chains modulo boundaries in the usual fashion ($H_n=\ker(\partial_n)/{\rm img}(\partial_{n+1})$). Does this work as a viable definition? Just as with contours in complex analysis, it seems we can homotope any submanifold and still represent the same element of homology. (For instance, consider a sphere $\cal A$ around the origin in $\Bbb R^3-0$ with orientation chosen to make outward-pointing normals by the right-hand-rule. Say we homotope this to a smaller sphere $\cal B$ within $\Bbb R^3-0$. Then $\cal A-B$ will be the oriented boundary of some oriented annular region and hence $\cal A-B\equiv{\rm 0}~\Rightarrow A=B$ in $H_2(\Bbb R^3-0)$. If we put a nice CW complex structure on $\cal M$, it feels like any submanifold (a generator) in the chain group $C_n({\cal M})$ may be homotoped to one comprised entirely of oriented cells from the complex. Thus, using CW complexes should represent a ""discretization"" of the definition I'm submitting that allows for finite computations to be humanly carried out. Moreever, every compact manifold can be triangulated, so it seems we can also relate it to singular homology. So, anyway, to repeat my question: does this work as a viable definition of homology?

Long version: Since the curvature of a curve is defined as $1/r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle that best describes the curve at the point of interest, infinite curvature is only possible when the circle has zero radius (it reduces to a single point ). In case of a $C^0$-connection between two parametric curves, it is obvious that the curvature goes to infinity. But apparently, this can also happen when two parametric curves meet with $C^1$-continuity. Any examples (e.g. using parametric polynomial curves)? With regard to surfaces — the two principal curvatures $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$ at the point $(u,v)$ of a parametric surface $X(u,v)$ are respectively the minimum and maximum normal curvature at this point $(u,v)$. The normal curvature in the direction $\phi$ is obtained when a plane containing the normal at $(u,v)$ is oriented in the direction $\phi$. The intersection of this plane and the surface results in a curve — the curvature of this curve in our point $(u,v)$ is called the normal curvature in the direction of $\phi$.

An object $X$ is rigid iff $X$ has no infinitesimal deformations -- i.e., $\text{Ker}(\varphi_*) = 0$. $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*)$ is the space of infinitesimal (or ""first-order"") obstructions.  An object $X$ is unobstructed iff $X$ has no obstructions -- i.e, $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*) = 0$. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the ""moduli space of local deformations of $X$.""  The ""formal tangent space"" $T_X\mathcal{M}$ is the space of first-order deformations -- i.e., $T_X\mathcal{M} \cong \text{Ker}(\varphi_*)$. Somehow , in some cases, the smoothness of $\mathcal{M}$ is related to whether $X$ is unobstructed.  In this case, $\dim(\mathcal{M}) = \dim(T_X\mathcal{M}) = \dim(\text{Ker}(\varphi_*))$. More hazy thoughts: I think in the cases I'm interested in, the map $\varphi_*$ can be regarded as the differential of some map $\varphi \colon \text{Somewhere} \to \text{Somewhere Else}$, and $\mathcal{M} = \varphi^{-1}(\text{point})$, so $\mathcal{M}$ is smooth if $\varphi$ is a submersion (meaning $\varphi_*$ is surjective, so $\text{Coker}(\varphi_*) = 0$), in which case $T_X\mathcal{M} = \text{Ker}(\varphi_*)$.  How any of this works precisely, I don't know.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'deformation-theory']"
81,Tangent space as derivations exercise,Tangent space as derivations exercise,,"Thinking of the tangent space to a manifold as derivations is a concept which just kind of eludes me. I am comfortable thinking about tangent vectors as equivalence classes of curves and with the physicists' tangent space. Something about the derivation itself just does not lend itself in my head to the idea of a tangent vector, and as a result, I can't really work with this definition. In particular the following exercise is giving me a hard time. For any $(U,x)$, consider the tangent lift $Tx: TU \rightarrow TV$ where $V=x(U)$. Since $V \subset \mathbb R^n$ we will identify $T_{x(p)}V$ with $\{ x(p) \} \times \mathbb R^n$. Using this identification show that $T_px \cdot v_p = (x(p), \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}(x \circ \gamma))$, interpreting both sides as derivations. (presumably $\gamma$ is a parameterized curve) The point of this exercise is going to be to use this result to produce natural charts on the tangent bundle. This part I'm okay with, since it's mostly just manipulating the equations. I just feel stuck when trying to think about the tangent space as derivations - like in this question I don't even see what the Leibniz law has to do with this problem. I'd appreciate it if someone could break down this idea for me in some amount of detail - I've been trying to read other explanations and I know what the definition of a derivation is, I just don't at all see what it has to do with tangent vectors, or how to use that idea to solve problems.

99,When Two Connections Determine the Same Geodesics,When Two Connections Determine the Same Geodesics,,"It's my first question!  I hope I'm correctly formatting it. I'm trying to prove that two connections $\nabla, \widetilde{\nabla}$ on a manifold determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating.  The difference tensor of two connections is the tensor $D(X,Y) = \widetilde{\nabla}_XY - \nabla_XY$, so this is saying that the geodesics are the same for the two connections iff $D(X,Y) = -D(Y,X)$ for all vector fields $X, Y$ on $M$. Since $D$ is a tensor it can be written as a sum of its symmetric and alternating parts, $D = S + A$.  Since $A(X,X) \equiv 0$ we have $D(X,X) = S(X,X)$.  So if $S(X,X) = 0$ then so does $D(X,X)$, and if $D(X,X)$ is always $0$, then $$ D(X+Y,X+Y) =S(X+Y, X+Y) = S(X,X) + S(Y,Y) + 2S(X,Y) = 2S(X,Y)$$ Then $S(X,Y) \equiv 0$.  So it's enough to check that having the same geodesics is the same as $D(X,X) \equiv 0$.  This observation was made in Spivak Vol. II Ch. 6, Addendum 1, but his proof that this latter condition is equivalent to the connections having the same geodesics doesn't make sense to me.

So if $S(X,X) = 0$ then so does $D(X,X)$, and if $D(X,X)$ is always $0$, then $$ D(X+Y,X+Y) =S(X+Y, X+Y) = S(X,X) + S(Y,Y) + 2S(X,Y) = 2S(X,Y)$$ Then $S(X,Y) \equiv 0$.  So it's enough to check that having the same geodesics is the same as $D(X,X) \equiv 0$.  This observation was made in Spivak Vol. II Ch. 6, Addendum 1, but his proof that this latter condition is equivalent to the connections having the same geodesics doesn't make sense to me. Does anyone know how to show that if the connections have the same geodesics then the difference tensor is $0$ on the diagonal?  That's the direction I'm stuck on.",,"['differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'riemannian-geometry', 'geodesic', 'connections']"
