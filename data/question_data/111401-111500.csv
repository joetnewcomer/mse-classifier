If you roll the cube on to a blue square, the blue square is picked up on one face of the cube; if you roll a blue face of the cube on to a non-blue square, the blueness is put down again.

We want to algorithmically compute all subgroups, and there are some ways to do that. First one: Compute all subsets. Verify for each of them if they're closed. Then we're done.

6,"Order 12 group with 3 generators, can I reduce to 2 generators?","Order 12 group with 3 generators, can I reduce to 2 generators?",,"I'm just getting back into group theory after studying it quite a few years ago. I ran into a seemingly-simple question as I was getting started, looking for advice. I was looking at the dihedral group with 6 elements (D6), and made a Cayley diagram of it ( see below ) with two concentric triangles: one triangle on the inside with a group generator ""a"" of order 3, with arrows going clockwise, and then one triangle on the outside with operator a's arrows going i n the counterclockwise direction, and finally connected the vertices of each triangle with another generator ""x"", of order 2. Simple enough so far. Now, I was curious what group I might obtain if I extended this Cayley diagram in a natural way, not by increasing the order of a, but instead by adding additional concentric triangles around the outside. Eventually, in order to make a valid-looking Cayley diagram, I added a total of two more concentric triangles, so I have 4 triangles total. For the new outer triangles, I repeated the pattern of connecting the vertices inside each triangle with operator a, continuing the pattern of alternating arrow directions: counterclockwise on one outer triangle, and then clockwise on the next, so that the arrow patters are alternating for each triangle. Now, in order to connect the vertices of each triangle to the next outer triangle, I introduced one more generator, ""y"" of order 2, and made sure each point in the diagram has arrows with all three operators (for x and y, I don't draw arrowheads, since these are order 2). I have x and y alternating as we move between triangles, so I think the Cayley diagram here is valid and I assume this corresponds to a group. The group must be nonabelian since axy != xay. I know from a Google search there are only 3 nonabelian groups of order 12, so this must be isomorphic to one of them: A4, D12, or Dic3. My question: I constructed this using 3 generators, a, x, and y, but for these other groups I see them each presented with just 2 generators . Furthermore, I don't see an obvious isomorphism just from looking at the Cayley graph structure.

Let $G$ be a finite group, and $\mathbb{C}$ the field of complex numbers. So the group algebra $\mathbb{C}G$ can be decomposed as full matrix algebras: $\mathbb{C}G = B_1 \oplus B_2 \oplus \dots \oplus B_k$ where $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$ , and each $B_i$ is isomorphic to the full $d_i \times d_i$ matrix algebra $M_{d_i}(\mathbb{C})$ . Each $B_i$ is a subalgebra, or 2-sided ideal of $\mathbb{C}G$ . Consider the regular representation of $G$ by right multiplication. So each $B_i$ can be decomposed as direct sum of $d_i$ copies of isomorphic irreducible $\mathbb{C}G$ -modules. This decomposition is only unique up to isomorphism, but not unique. Let's say one of the decomposition is as follows: $B_i = V_{i,1} \oplus V_{i,2} \oplus \dots \oplus V_{i,d_i}$ Each of the above summands is a $d_i$ -dimensional irreducible (right) $\mathbb{C}G$ -module affording the same irreducible character $\psi$ of $G$ .

Obviously this subgroup depends on the choice of $V$ , but are they all isomorphic or conjugate in $G$ for all the irreducible (right) $\mathbb{C}G$ -submodules isomorphic to $V$ ? What is the relationship between these subgroups and $\psi$ ?

20,Are there equations which have solutions in all groups but which are not algebraicly solvable,Are there equations which have solutions in all groups but which are not algebraicly solvable,,"I am not sure exactly how to phrase this problem so I appologise if it is not clear, also this is somewhat long but I wanted to explain exactly where I was with the problem. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Description of Problem Given a set of variables $\{x,y,z,...\}$ and a variable $o$ is it possible to define a finite product of these variables and their inverses $\sigma(x,y,z,...,x^{-1},y^{-1},z^{-1},...,o,o^{-1})$ (i.e. a finite sequence made up of these variables and their inverses) such that; 1) For any group $G$ and any assignment of values from $G$ to $\{x,y,z,...\}$ there exists a unique element $g$ of $G$ such that if $o$ is set to $g$ ; $\sigma(x,y,z,...,x^{-1},y^{-1},z^{-1},...,o,o^{-1})=1$ and 2) There does not exist a finite product $\gamma(x,y,z,...,x^{-1},y^{-1},z^{-1},...)$ such that; $o=\gamma(x,y,z,...,x^{-1},y^{-1},z^{-1},...)$ for all groups $G$ Rough explaination as to why I am asking here My intuition is no but I am unsure how to prove this. There are clearly examples of equations like these solvable in all groups (i.e. $xo=1$ ) but these have algebraic solutions (in that example $o=x^{-1}$ ) and there are examples of these equations which are solvable in wide classes of groups (i.e. $o^{n!+1}x=1$ is solvable in any group of order less than $n$ with $o=x^{-1}$ ) but these are not solvable in all groups. In addition some equations are solvable in all groups but not uniquely (i.e. $o^2=1$ has many solutions in groups with elements of order 2 but can always be solved with $o=1$ ) Progress on proof (or proof of falsehood) It can be shown that $\sigma$ must contain exactly $\pm1$ total occurences of $o$ (where $o^{-1}$ counts as $-1$ occurence of o) using the following argument. If $G$ is abelian then $\sigma$ can be written as $Ao^n$ for some $A$ which is a product of the other variables. For this to be solvable $o^n=A^{-1}$ must be solvable in every abelian group. If $A=1$ $o$ is not uniquely defined for groups of order $|n|$ . If $A\neq1$ and $|n|\neq1$ then $o$ is not defined for groups of order $|n|$ or $n=0$ and so $o$ is not unique. Therefore $|n|=1$ and so the total number of occurences of $o$ in $\sigma$ must be $\pm1$ .

If you have any questions feel free to ask. Description of Problem Given a set of variables and a variable is it possible to define a finite product of these variables and their inverses (i.e. a finite sequence made up of these variables and their inverses) such that; 1) For any group and any assignment of values from to there exists a unique element of such that if is set to ; and 2) There does not exist a finite product such that; for all groups Rough explaination as to why I am asking here My intuition is no but I am unsure how to prove this. There are clearly examples of equations like these solvable in all groups (i.e. ) but these have algebraic solutions (in that example ) and there are examples of these equations which are solvable in wide classes of groups (i.e. is solvable in any group of order less than with ) but these are not solvable in all groups. In addition some equations are solvable in all groups but not uniquely (i.e. has many solutions in groups with elements of order 2 but can always be solved with ) Progress on proof (or proof of falsehood) It can be shown that must contain exactly total occurences of (where counts as occurence of o) using the following argument. If is abelian then can be written as for some which is a product of the other variables. For this to be solvable must be solvable in every abelian group. If is not uniquely defined for groups of order . If and then is not defined for groups of order or and so is not unique. Therefore and so the total number of occurences of in must be .

I'm looking for an elementary proof of what I think should be a much simpler theorem. Suppose that we're interested in the set of all functions on the sphere that have the same $L$, i.e., the set of all complex-valued functions that are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with eigenvalue $-L(L+1)$. I'm looking for the most elementary possible proof that for this fixed $L$, the set $\{Y_{Lm}\}$ for varying $m$ is a basis. That is, I want an elementary proof that the multiplicity is $2L+1$. Ideally I would like this to be at a freshman physics level, intelligible even to people who haven't had linear algebra. (So the language would actually be less sophisticated that in my statement of the problem above.) I would be perfectly happy with a proof restricted to $L=1$. The closest I've been able to come is an approach that is kind of complicated, and I'm not sure it's even right. First we reduce the problem to real-valued functions by forming linear combinations of $Y_{Lm}$ and $Y_{L,-m}$. Next we argue that if the hypothesis were false, we would be able to witness its failure with a state $W$ of definite $m$ (i.e., one whose azimuthal variation is $e^{im}$) that is independent of $Y_{Lm}$. Now form linear combinations of $W$ with $Y_{Lm}$ such that the linear combination $X$ vanishes at some $\theta$. This can be done at almost all $\theta$. Finally, tune the choice of $\theta$ so that for this particular value of $\theta$, not just $X$ but $\partial X/\partial \theta$ vanishes as well. Now argue that by uniqueness of solutions to 2nd order differential equations, $X$ vanishes identically, which is a contradiction. I'm not sure that the last part even works, since the standard uniqueness theorems may not work for a space with this topology. Is there a simpler way to go about this? I also thought about physical arguments involving state counting. If the $L=1$ state has multiplicity 3, then coupling two spin-1 states gives 9 states, and this makes sense because you get spin-0, spin-1, and spin-2 couplings, for a total of 1+3+5=9 states. But all this really seems to do is prove that if the multiplicity of spin $L$ is $2L+1$, we get self-consistency --- it doesn't seem to show that $2L+1$ is necessary.

(3) We have that $n_p(G) \equiv 1(p). $ Then $n=12=2^2*3^1$ so $n_2(G)|3$ gives $n_2(G) \in \{1,3\}$ and $n_3(G)|4$ so $n_3(G) \in \{1,4\}$ since $2 \not\equiv 1(3)$.

I have thought it over for some time but really cannot figure out a proof of this statement. Let me try to state the question more clearly below. Consider a tensor $T^a$ where $a$ refers to a list of contravariant indices, like $T^{1234}$. Now one may symmetrize this tensor according to a given Young Tableaux, namely $\tau$, and the resulting tensor is denoted by $$T^{\tau(a)}.$$ It is noted that, according to theorems on representations of symmetric group $S_n$, $\tau$ corresponds to a irreducible representation of $S_n$. Now one considers a covariant tensor ${T'_b}$ and a different Young Tableaux $\lambda$, where $b$ contains the same number of indices, $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are not equivalent (one may assume $\tau$ > $\lambda$ without loss of generality). It is stated that the contraction $$T^{\tau(a)}T'_{\lambda(a)}=0.$$ It is obviously true when $\tau$ corresponds to the symmetrizer and $\lambda$ is the anti-symmetrizer .

In its proof, it simply mentioned (without deeper arguments as if it is quite obvious) that the contraction two tensors is zero if their indices belong to different symmetry types. I have thought it over for some time but really cannot figure out a proof of this statement. Let me try to state the question more clearly below. Consider a tensor $T^a$ where $a$ refers to a list of contravariant indices, like $T^{1234}$. Now one may symmetrize this tensor according to a given Young Tableaux, namely $\tau$, and the resulting tensor is denoted by $$T^{\tau(a)}.$$ It is noted that, according to theorems on representations of symmetric group $S_n$, $\tau$ corresponds to a irreducible representation of $S_n$. Now one considers a covariant tensor ${T'_b}$ and a different Young Tableaux $\lambda$, where $b$ contains the same number of indices, $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are not equivalent (one may assume $\tau$ > $\lambda$ without loss of generality). It is stated that the contraction $$T^{\tau(a)}T'_{\lambda(a)}=0.$$ It is obviously true when $\tau$ corresponds to the symmetrizer and $\lambda$ is the anti-symmetrizer .

57,About the construction of resolvents in Galois theory (over $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{C}$),About the construction of resolvents in Galois theory (over  in ),\mathbb{Q} \mathbb{C},"I have to say that my question is quite long and I apologize for this. The  main idea is that I would like to show how to construct resolvents for any transitive subgroup of the permutation group to some students. I present here the whole construction but I think there is a problem at the end and I would be happy if someone could help me to fix it. I am looking for a way to compute the Galois group of an irreducible monic polynomial. That is, given an integer $n$ and a transitive subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$. Find a way to answer (with a little computation) for each $P\in\mathbb{Q}[X]$ do we have $Gal(P,\mathbb{Q})\subseteq $ some conjugate of the group $G$. A resolvent $R_G$ for $G$ is then a polynomial in $n+1$ variables : $$R_G\in\mathbb{Q}[A_1,...,A_n,X] $$ Such that if : $$P(Y)=Y^n+\sum_{k=1}^na_kY^{n-k} $$ We have $Gal(P,\mathbb{Q})\subseteq $ some conjugate of the group $G$ if and only if $R_G(a_1,...,a_n,X)$ has a root in $\mathbb{Q}$. I claim that we all know such an example of resolvent for $G=\mathfrak{A}_n$ : $$R_{\mathfrak{A}_n}(X)=X^2-Discr(P) $$ Now, imitating the idea for $G=\mathfrak{A}_n$ would go as follows : Given some $G$ a transitive subgroup of $\mathfrak{S}_n$, first find : $$U\in\mathbb{Z}[Y_1,...,Y_n]\text{ such that } Stab_{\mathfrak{S}_n}(U)=G  $$ Then using a system $(g_i)$ of representative for $\mathfrak{S}_n/G$ (its cardinal being $d$) : $$S_G(Y_1,...,Y_n,X):=\prod_{i=1}^d(X-[g_i.U](Y_1,...,Y_n)) $$ Finally : $$S_G(Y_1,...,Y_n,X)=X^d+\sum_{r=1}^dV_r(Y_1,...,Y_n)X^{d-r} $$ From the first expression of $S_G$ we actually see that it is fixed by every permutation of $Y_1,..,Y_n$ so that each of the $V_r$ is a symmetric polynomial in the variables $Y_1,...,Y_n$.  If we set : $$A_k=(-1)^k\sum_{1\leq l_1<...<l_k\leq n}Y_{l_1}...Y_{l_k} $$ By the Newton's theorem about symmetric polynomials we finally get that there exists $R_G$ : $$S_G(Y_1,...,Y_n,X)=R_G(A_1,...,A_n,X) $$ Now I would like to proove that such a $R_G$ is a resolvent for $G$. Take : $$P(Y)=(Y-y_1)...(Y-y_n)=Y^n+\sum_{k=1}^na_kY^{n-k}$$ Suppose that $Gal(P,\mathbb{Q})\subseteq $ some conjugate of $G$, let's say $g_kGg_k^{-1}$ then  we have that for all $\sigma\in Gal(P,\mathbb{Q})$ $g_k^{-1}\sigma g_k$ is in $Stab(U)$ (here I identify the decomposition field of $P$automorphism with the permutation induced on the roots of my polynomial $P$) then we have : $$\sigma([g_k.U](y_1,...,y_n))=g_k(g_k^{-1}\sigma g_k).U(y_1,...,y_n)=g_k.U(y_1,...,y_n) $$ So we see that the complex number $[g_k.U](y_1,...,y_n)$ is fixed by any automorphism of the decomposition field so it must be rational. This gives the first part. Now, here comes my problem when you reverse the process you want to  do the following implication (recalling that an automorphism of the decomposition field is at the same time a permutation of the roots and the correspondence is faithfull) because a root of $R_G(a_1,...,a_n,X)$ is supposed to be rational we get for some $k$ : $$[g_k.U](y_1,...,y_n)\in \mathbb{Q} $$ We see that this means, in particular that $\sigma\in Stab([g_k.U](y_1,...,y_n))$ and I would like to deduce from that $\sigma\in Stab(g_k.U(Y_1,...,Y_n))$.

Standard arguments show that $[KL:F]$ must be in $\{p,2p,\ldots,p^2\}$. But are all these multiples attained for every $p$? I.e. for all primes $p$ and for all integers $1\leq r\leq p$, do there exist $K$, $L$, and $F$ as above with $[KL:F]=rp$? Stating this in terms of Galois theory (using the fact that every prime-degree extension is separable), does there exist a group $G$ with index-$p$ subgroups $H_1,H_2$ of $G$ such that $|G:H_1\cap H_2|=rp$? Edit (I'm not sure whether this should be in an answer or not): It's straightforward to show that if $KL/F$ is Galois, so that $G$ is its Galois group, then either $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$: Assume $r\neq p$. By Sylow's theorems, $n_p:=\text{number of Sylow }p\text{-groups}$ is congruent to $1$ mod $p$ and divides $r$. But $r<p$, so $n_p=1$. Thus, there's a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow $p$-subgroup $P\cong Z_p$. So, $G= P\rtimes H_1=P\rtimes H_2$. If $(r,p-1)=1$, then there's no nontrivial homomorphism from either $H_1$ or $H_2$ to $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p)\cong Z_{p-1}$, and so the semidirect products are in fact direct. But then (since $r\neq p$) $H_1$ and $H_2$ are normal Hall subgroups of the same order and therefore equal, which can only happen if $r=1$. Thus, $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$. So, to solve the general problem when $(r,p-1)=1$, we can't make the simplifying assumption that $H_1$ and $H_2$ have trivial intersection, i.e. that $KL/F$ is Galois.","Suppose $K/F$ and $L/F$ are extensions of $F$ (contained in some common field) of degree $p$, where $p$ is prime.

Stating this in terms of Galois theory (using the fact that every prime-degree extension is separable), does there exist a group $G$ with index-$p$ subgroups $H_1,H_2$ of $G$ such that $|G:H_1\cap H_2|=rp$? Edit (I'm not sure whether this should be in an answer or not): It's straightforward to show that if $KL/F$ is Galois, so that $G$ is its Galois group, then either $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$: Assume $r\neq p$. By Sylow's theorems, $n_p:=\text{number of Sylow }p\text{-groups}$ is congruent to $1$ mod $p$ and divides $r$. But $r<p$, so $n_p=1$. Thus, there's a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow $p$-subgroup $P\cong Z_p$. So, $G= P\rtimes H_1=P\rtimes H_2$. If $(r,p-1)=1$, then there's no nontrivial homomorphism from either $H_1$ or $H_2$ to $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p)\cong Z_{p-1}$, and so the semidirect products are in fact direct. But then (since $r\neq p$) $H_1$ and $H_2$ are normal Hall subgroups of the same order and therefore equal, which can only happen if $r=1$. Thus, $r=p$ or $(r,p-1)\neq 1$. So, to solve the general problem when $(r,p-1)=1$, we can't make the simplifying assumption that $H_1$ and $H_2$ have trivial intersection, i.e. that $KL/F$ is Galois.",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'field-theory', 'galois-theory']"

Let's assume that $H$ is core-free in $K$ and $K$ is core-free in $G$, so these are, indeed, permutation groups. I suspect there is a natural way to write the action of $G$ on the set $\Omega = G/H$ in terms of (a composition of) the actions $G$ on $\Gamma$ and $K$ on $\Delta$.  In other words, I think the action of $G$ on $\Omega$ could be viewed as (1) permuting the cosets of $H$ which lie within a single $K$-coset, followed by (2) permuting the cosets of $K$.  So it seems there is a wreath product underlying this, but I'm having trouble writing it down. Here's what I have so far.

For each $g \in G$ and $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ we define $g_i$ to be the element of $G^n$ with a $g$ in position $i$ , and also in every position $j$ such that $j$ is adjacent to $i$ . Then we define $G^\Gamma$ to be the subgroup of $G^n$ generated by all $g_i$ . For example, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a path of length 2, with edges connecting 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. Then $G^\Gamma$ is generated by elements of the form $(g, g, 1), (g, g, g)$ , and $(1, g, g)$ . It's not hard to show that in this case we get all of $G^3$ .
