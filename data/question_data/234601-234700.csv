I can see that $Z=\{\frac1n:n \in \mathbb N\}$ is order isomorphic to $\omega$, but I don't see how to deal with isomorphism to powers of $\omega$. I'm aware that a way of thinking of $\omega^2$ is as $\omega$ copies of $\omega$ Solution: (i) So I'm looking for $\omega$ many increasing sequences following on the idea in the comments. Let $F:[0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,1)$ be a linearly piecewise map such that $F:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,\frac 12)$ $F:[1,2] \rightarrow [\frac 12,\frac 23)$ and $F:[n,n+1] \rightarrow [{n \over n+1},{n+1 \over n+2})$ Now let $A^i$={$i- \frac 1n: n \in \mathbb N$} for $i \ge 1$ So each $A^i$ is an increasing sequence of order type $\omega$ Let $Z= \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb N}F""(A^i)$ Then Z has order tupe $ \omega^2$ where $F""(A^i)$ is the range of $F$ on $A^i$. So $A = Z \cup$ {$k:k \ge 1 \land k \in \mathbb N$} is order isomorphic to $\omega^{2}+\omega$ (ii) Let $C^l$ = {$k+l:k \in B,l \in$ {odds}}, then $\bigcup_{k \in {odds}}C^k$ has order type $\omega^3$ and $\bigcup_{k \in {odds}}C^k \cup \bigcup_{k \in {evens}}C^k$ is order isomorphic to $2.\omega^3$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'order-theory', 'ordinals']"

There are 30 students: 16 are girls; There are 7 girls and 6 boys who have blue eyes. A student is randomly chosen to be class monitor. Draw a Venn Diagram to represent this information. Progress I thought a possible answer would be 2 separate circles, one for boys and one for girls. Each one of the circles would have a smaller circle inside, with the total of each with blue eyes. For example, the girl's would have 8 in the large circle and 6 in the smaller circle situated inside of the larger one. And for the boys, there would be 9 in the large and 7 in the smaller circle. According to some, it wouldn't qualify as a Venn-Diagram, so I don't know if it's correct.",,"['probability', 'elementary-set-theory']"

51,Using the Cantor-Bernstein theorem,Using the Cantor-Bernstein theorem,,"I'm working through Kolmogorov and Fomin's Introductory Real Analysis text, and I came to a question about showing that some sets have the same power as the continuum. I have seen this question posted on here before, but I decided to post this anyways because I have solutions to the 3 parts of the question and am specifically looking for feedback on if I am using the Cantor-Bernstein theorem correctly. I'll just post one of the sets, since the method I used for the other two is identical. So, the first set to be considered is the set of all $n$-tuples of real numbers, denoted as $N$. Let $f:N\rightarrow [0,1]$ be a function that takes each entry of an $n$-tuple, takes their non-decimal part and interleaves this with the decimal part like so: $(x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n) \mapsto 0.r_1r_2r_3...r_nx_{11}x_{21}x_{31}...x_{n1}...x_{ij}$, where $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $1 \leq j < \infty$, with $n$ incrementing by one each time a decimal part would repeat infinitely. In this way, we identify an unique real number in $[0,1]$ with each $n$-tuple. Now, for the injection from $\mathbb{R} \to N'$. For each real number $x$, let the function $g$ identify $x$ with an unique ""degenerate"" $n$-tuple of the form $(x,0,0,...,0)$. These degenerate $n$-tuples clearly form a subset $N' \subset N$, and we have the second injection. Since we have an injection $g$ from $\mathbb{R} \to N'\subset N$ and an injection $f$ from $N\rightarrow [0,1] \subset \mathbb{R}$, by the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, $N \sim \mathbb{R}$. So, my questions are (1) is my proof correct, (2) is this proper usage of Cantor-Bernstein theorem, and (3) is it conventional to show injectivity of the functions even after defining them explicitly?

Let me set up: $\mathcal{J}$ is a semialgebra of subsets of $\Omega$. Meaning that: $\emptyset, \Omega \in \mathcal{J}$. $\mathcal{J}$ is closed under intersections. If $A \in \mathcal{J}$ then $A^C$ is a finite disjoint union of elements of $\mathcal{J}$. Then let $\{A_i\}$ be a countable family of elements of $\mathcal{J}$ such that $\bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal{J}$. For the purpose of the proof, he need a disjoint family to apply Additivity, hence he construct a family $\{D_i\}$ with $D_1 = A_1$ and $$ D_n = A_n - \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i\right) = A_n \cap \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i^C\right)$$ Now by construction $\{D_i\}$ are disjoint and $\bigcup_i D_i = \bigcup_i A_1$. So far I got it, but then he says: Furthermore, since $\mathcal{J}$ is a semialgebra, each $D_n$ can be written as a finite disjoint union of elements of $\mathcal{J}$. For that to apply, $D_n^C$ have to be in $\mathcal{J}$, but that does not seem to be the case, as $$ D_n^C = \left( A_n \cap \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i^C\right) \right)^C$$ $$ = A_n^C \cup \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}A_i\right) $$ As $A_i \in \mathcal{J}$, the closest that I got is that $D_i^C$ is a finite union of elements of $\mathcal{J}$, but as a semialgebra may not be closed under unions.

Let me set up: $\mathcal{J}$ is a semialgebra of subsets of $\Omega$. Meaning that: $\emptyset, \Omega \in \mathcal{J}$. $\mathcal{J}$ is closed under intersections. If $A \in \mathcal{J}$ then $A^C$ is a finite disjoint union of elements of $\mathcal{J}$. Then let $\{A_i\}$ be a countable family of elements of $\mathcal{J}$ such that $\bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal{J}$.
