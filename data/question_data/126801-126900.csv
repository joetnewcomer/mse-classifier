2,What is the explicit ${\rm GL}_n$-action on the Weyl algebra?,What is the explicit -action on the Weyl algebra?,{\rm GL}_n,"This is a typical classical invariant theory setup.  Let $V = \mathbb C^n$ , and let $\mathbb C[V] \cong \mathbb C[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be the space of polynomial functions on $V$ .  The group $G={\rm GL}(n,\mathbb C)$ acts on $V$ in the obvious way, inducing the usual action on $\mathbb C[V]$ via $(g \cdot f)(v) = f(g^{-1}v)$ for $g \in G$ , $f \in \mathbb C[V]$ , and $v \in V$ .  Hence $G \subset {\rm End}(\mathbb C[V])$ . Now consider the Weyl algebra $\mathbb D(V)$ consisting of polynomial-coefficient differential operators on $\mathbb C[V]$ .  Clearly $\mathbb D(V) \subset {\rm End}(\mathbb C[V])$ as well, and in fact $G$ normalizes $\mathbb D(V)$ ; that is, we have a group action of $G$ on $\mathbb D(V)$ given by $$ g \cdot D = g \circ D \circ g^{-1} \in \mathbb D(V), $$ for $g \in G$ and $D \in \mathbb D(V)$ .  Given the action above, I have seen several sources state without proof that the $G$ -action on the span of the differential operators $\partial_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \in \mathbb D(V)$ is equivalent to the defining representation $V$ , whereas the $G$ -action on the span of the multiplication operators $x_i \in \mathbb D(V)$ is equivalent to the dual $V^*$ . This has been driving me insane; below is my attempt to convince myself of this fact, using a concrete example.  Is this the correct way to think about the actions here?  Or, is there a more obvious way to see it? Example. Let $n=2$ , so that $\mathbb C[V] = \mathbb C[x,y]$ , and $\mathbb D(V)$ is generated by the set $\{x,y,\partial_x, \partial_y\}$ .  Consider $g=\left[ \begin{smallmatrix} 3 & 5\\1 & 2 \end{smallmatrix}\right] \in G$ , so that $g^{-1} = \left[ \begin{smallmatrix} \phantom{-}2 & -5\\-1 & \phantom{-}3 \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ .  If my interpretation above is correct, then we should have the following: \begin{align*} g \cdot \partial_x &= 3 \partial_x + \partial_y\\ g \cdot \partial_y &= 5 \partial_x + 2 \partial_y\\ g \cdot x &= 2x - 5y\\ g \cdot y &= -x + 3y. \end{align*} (Note that I have $G$ acting via inverse transpose on $x$ and $y$ , since those are suppposed to play the role of the basis vectors of $V^*$ .)  Here is my attempted justification for the first equation above, using $u$ and $v$ to substitute in the third line: \begin{align*} (g\cdot \partial_x) \cdot f(x,y) &= (g \circ \partial_x \circ g^{-1})\cdot f(x,y)\\ &= (g \circ \partial_x) \cdot f(3x+5y, \: x+2y)\\ &= (g \circ \partial_x) \cdot f(u,v)\\ &= g \cdot f_x(u,v)\\ &= g \cdot (f_u u_x + f_v v_x) & \text{(chain rule)}\\ &= g \cdot (3 f_u(u,v) + f_v(u,v))\\ &= 3 g \cdot f_u(u,v) + g \cdot f_v(u,v)\\ &= 3 f_x(x,y) + f_y(x,y)\\ &= (3 \partial_x + \partial_y)\cdot f(x,y). \end{align*} This is the ""correct"" anticipated result, but am I applying all the transformations in the correct order? Likewise, for the third equation above (the action of $g$ on $x$ ), I have this so far: \begin{align*} (g \cdot x) \cdot f(x,y) &= (g \circ x \circ g^{-1}) \cdot f(x,y)\\ &= (g \circ x) \cdot f (u,v) \\ &= g \cdot x f(u,v). \end{align*} This is where I'm not sure how to finish rigorously; one one hand, $g$ should transform $f(u,v)$ back into $f(x,y)$ , and on the other hand, since $g^{-1} \cdot \left[\begin{smallmatrix} x \\ y \end{smallmatrix}\right] = \left[\begin{smallmatrix} 2x - 5y \\ -x + 3y \end{smallmatrix}\right]$ , I suppose that the $g$ -action here transforms the ""extra"" $x$ into $2x-5y$ ?

4,On the necessary and sufficient conditions for primitive group action!,On the necessary and sufficient conditions for primitive group action!,,"Claim : The transitive group $G$ is primitive on $A$ if and only if $G_a$ is a maximal group of $G$ for all $a \in A$ , where $G_a$ is the stabilizer of $a$ . I've been trying to prove a stronger claim. Concretely, let $P$ be the set of all subgroups of $G$ containing $G_a$ , and $Q$ be the set of all blocks of $A$ containing $a$ . My claim is that there exists a bijective map $f: P \to Q$ . Proof : Given subgroup $G'$ containing $G_a$ , let $f(G')=A = \{ \sigma(a) | \sigma \in G' \}$ . $A$ is indeed a block, for if $\sigma \in G'$ then $\sigma(A) = A$ since $G'$ is subgroup. If $\sigma \notin G'$ , then $\sigma(A) \cap A = \emptyset$ because otherwise we have $\sigma \sigma_1(a)=\sigma_2(a)$ for some $\sigma_1, \sigma_2 \in G'$ , but that means $\sigma_2^{-1}\sigma\sigma_1 \in G_a$ which implies $\sigma \in G'$ , a contradiction. Conversely, for each block $B$ containing $a$ , let the set $G_B = \{\sigma \in G | \sigma(B) = B\}$ . It's clear that $G_B$ is a subgroup containing $G_a$ , this shows that $f$ is surjective. Suppose the map $f$ is not injective, say $G_1$ and $G_2$ are distinct subgroups of $G$ containing $G_a$ , let $\sigma \in G_1$ such that $\sigma \notin G_2 $ , then since $f(G_1)=f(G_2)$ we have $\sigma(a) = \sigma_1(a)$ for some $\sigma_1 \in G_2$ . But this would imply that $\sigma \sigma_1^{-1} \in G_a$ and therefore $\sigma \in G_2$ , we reach a contradiction. I think my proof is right, but I did not use the fact that $G$ acts transitively on $A$ . Moreover, in the proof of the original's claim, the authors did use this condition, but the proof is totally different from mine. So I want to ask if the claim still remains true if we remove the condition that $G$ acts transitively on $A$ ? In other words, is my proof right? Any help would be appreciated! Edit : As @Derek Holt pointed out in the comment below, my stronger claim is wrong since the map $f$ is not well-defined yet, in particular, $f^{-1}(\{a,b,c\}) = f^{-1}(\{a,b\})=\{ (a\text{ } b), e\}$ shows that $f$ is not actually well-defined. Given a block $B$ containing $a$ , the problem came from my proof is that $G_B = \{\sigma \in G | \sigma(B) = B\}$ is still a subgroup containing $G_a$ , but there is no guarantee that $f(G_B) = B$ . In fact, it's only know that $f(G_B) \subset B$ (why?). However, by adding the condition that $G$ acts transitively on $A$ , my stronger claim will become true since in that case, we must have $B \subset f(G_B)$ and therefore $f(G_B) = B$ as desired. Here is the approach: Proof : Since $\sigma (B)=B$ for all $\sigma \in G_B$ , then by the fact that $a\in B$ , we must have $\sigma(a) \in B$ for all $\sigma \in G_B$ . This shows that $f(G_B) \subset B$ . Let $b \in B$ , since $G$ acts transitively on $A$ (here is where we need transitivity), then there is a $\sigma \in G$ sending $a$ to $b$ (i.e $\sigma(a)=b$ ). But then we have $\sigma(B)$ intersects $B$ and by definition of block, we must have $\sigma(B)=B$ which shows that $\sigma \in G_B$ , then $f(G_B)$ contains $b$ . Hence we have $f(G_B) = B$ , completing the proof.","Claim : The transitive group is primitive on if and only if is a maximal group of for all , where is the stabilizer of .

7,Understanding the symmetries of f(x)=7x (mod 12),Understanding the symmetries of f(x)=7x (mod 12),,"I found something interesting while studying the circle of fifths. Define a map $f(x) = 7x$ (mod 12), this models the circle of fifths as a table. The input is the location on the circle of fifths, the output is the note at that location on the circle of fifths. You could also read the input as the number of sharps or flats in the scale. So $f(2) = 14 \equiv 2$ (mod 12) reads ""the scale with two sharps is D"" or ""two o'clock on the circle of fifths is D"". And $f(-1) = -7 \equiv 5$ (mod 12) reads ""the scale with one flat is F"". The function f is an involution, because $f(f(x)) = 7(7x) = 49x= (48 + 1)x \equiv x$ (mod 12). While pairing up the elements, a beautiful relation appeared: A line between two numbers means those numbers map to each other, no line means the number maps to itself. It's easy to verify this picture, Proof: Evens are fixed because: $f(2n) = 7(2n) = 14n = (12 + 2)n \equiv 2n$ (mod 12) Odds map to the opposite side of the circle because: $f(2n + 1) = f(2n) + f(1) = 2n + f(1) = 2n + 7 = (2n + 1) + 6$ My goal is to understand the above picture better, I'm open to general suggestions about how to do this, but I got stuck trying something very specific. I'm trying to articulate the question ""Prove the symmetries of this function are $D_{12}$ "" I've begun by defining: $i(n) = n$ (mod 12) $r(n) = n + 2$ (mod 12) $s(n) = -n$ (mod 12) These satisfy: $r^6 = s^2 = (rs)^2 = i$ which make them generators of $D_{12}$ . I'm struggling to continue my argument, here is my current attempt: Now let $D_{12}$ act on $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z})$ by conjugation. So for $g \in \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z})$ and $p \in D_{12}$ we have $p \cdot g = p g p^{-1}$ . Now we can show $D_{12}$ fixes $f$ , it follows from $r \cdot f (x) = r f r^{-1} (x) = - f(- x) = - 7(- x) = 7x = f(x)$ and $s \cdot f(x) = s f s^{-1} (x) = f(x - 2) + 2 = f(x) - 2 + 2 = f(x)$ I have a handful of misgivings with my thoughts so far. I don't know what larger group should be thought of as containing $D_{12}$ . And $f$ being a fixed point of a group doesn't prove it isn't a fixed point of some larger group. Right now, my current approach for a fix of this is to prove that the stabilizer subgroup of the permutations with respect to $f$ equals the dihedral group: ${S_{12}}_f = D_{12}$ . Is there a more specific ambient space than just permutations though? Aren't I cheating by applying an arbitrary permutation to a ring isomorphism. And that's what my map is right? Or is it actually a $Z/12Z$ - module isomorphism? I feel very stuck on what I think are some pretty basic concepts. I have a strong intuition for the symmetries of this circle now, For example from the above it's clear that f having one flat is equivalent to b having five sharps. But I'm struggling translating these intuitions into algebraic proofs. I would appreciate any help incorporating $D_{12}$ into wherever it belongs. Best, Edit: I tried to clarify my definition. I'm getting suggestions that I either meant, or should be using the function $m(k) = k + 7$ (mod 12). I labeled it "" $m$ "" for modulate. It has the advantage that the inputs and the outputs are both semitones.

Define a map (mod 12), this models the circle of fifths as a table. The input is the location on the circle of fifths, the output is the note at that location on the circle of fifths. You could also read the input as the number of sharps or flats in the scale. So (mod 12) reads ""the scale with two sharps is D"" or ""two o'clock on the circle of fifths is D"". And (mod 12) reads ""the scale with one flat is F"". The function f is an involution, because (mod 12).

(4 answers) Closed 3 years ago . I try to come up with a proof of the following statement, but I find it a little difficult. I hope that I can get some help from someone on this site. I think this is what they give a proof of, on Ncatlab - Tannakian Duality (at the section $G-\mathbf{Sets}$ ). But I can't really follow that proof: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Tannaka+duality#ForPermutationRepresentations . Statement. Let $F:G-\mathbf{Sets}\to\mathbf{Sets}$ be the forgetful functor, where $G-\mathbf{Sets}$ is the category of sets equipped with a group action by the group $G$ . I'm trying to understand the proof of the following fact $$\operatorname{Aut}(F)\cong G.$$ What I have done I have managed to construct a map $$\varphi:G\to\operatorname{Aut}(F)$$ This was done by the following rule $\varphi(g)=\eta^g$ , where $\eta_S^g:S\to S$ is defined by $\eta_S^g(s)=s\cdot g$ . It is straightforward to check that this gives a natural transformation from $F$ to $F$ and that it also is a group homomorphism. However , the other way is more problematic for me. I want to find a map $$\psi:\operatorname{Aut}(F)\to G.$$ That is, given a natural transformation $\eta$ , I want to assign it to a group element $g\in G$ . The natural transformation $\eta$ is defined by the following commutative diagram $\require{AMScd}$ $$ \newcommand{\ra}[1]{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\xrightarrow{\quad#1\quad}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\left\downarrow{\scriptstyle#1}\vphantom{\displaystyle\int_0^1}\right.} % \begin{array}{llllllllllll} F(X) & \ra{\eta_X} & F(X) \\ \da{F(f)} & & \da{F(f)} \\ F(Y) & \ra{\eta_Y} & F(Y) & \\ \end{array} $$ where $\eta_X$ is a morphism in $\mathbf{Sets}$ and $f:X \to Y$ is a morphism in the category $G-\mathbf{Sets}$ . Since $F$ is just the forgetful functor, the above diagram reduces to $$ \newcommand{\ra}[1]{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\xrightarrow{\quad#1\quad}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\left\downarrow{\scriptstyle#1}\vphantom{\displaystyle\int_0^1}\right.} % \begin{array}{llllllllllll} X & \ra{\eta_X} & X \\ \da{f} & & \da{f} \\ Y & \ra{\eta_Y} & Y & \\ \end{array} $$ Concerns and Questions In the definition of natural transformation - I have that - given any $G-\text{Set}$ $X$ , $\eta_X:F(X)\to F(X)$ is a morphism. A natural $G-\text{Set}$ is simply to take $X=G$ and to let it act on itself through the group structure: $$\varphi: G\times G\to G \\ (g,s)\mapsto g\cdot s.$$ So the commutative diagram now becomes $$ \newcommand{\ra}[1]{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\xrightarrow{\quad#1\quad}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\left\downarrow{\scriptstyle#1}\vphantom{\displaystyle\int_0^1}\right.} % \begin{array}{llllllllllll} G & \ra{\eta_G} & G \\ \da{f} & & \da{f} \\ Y & \ra{\eta_Y} & Y & \\ \end{array} $$ Remark 1. I remember a professor told me that the morphism $\eta_G$ is totally understood by what it does to the identity element $e\in G$ (from which I should be able to understand how to construct the group homomorphism), $$e\mapsto \eta_G(e).$$ I don't really understand what the above means. I think I have misunderstood something about the forgetful functor. When I think about the forgetful functor $F:A\to B$ , I think that the functor forgets everything that is present in $A$ , but isn't present in $B$ . In our case, it forgets the structure of group actions. And so, in particular, I cannot use the property of being a $G$ -equivariant map. Only the properties of being a set-theoretic map. Question 1. If $\eta_G(e)=s$ , and if I would like to make sense of what the professor told me, I think I would reason something as follows $$\eta_G(g)=\eta_G(e\cdot g)=\eta_G(e)\eta_G(g)=s\eta_G(g).$$ where I in the second equality used the property of being a group homomorphism. But on the other hand, if I want to treat it as a group homomorphism, then I think I had to do it to start with. That is, $\eta_G$ must map identities to identities (in order to be consistent in my reasoning). So I think my argument fails. My question is: What does he mean? I don't think what I did above makes any sense. But I think I have seen others using the properties of the morphisms in the category $A$ , after having applied the forgetful functor, hence my reasoning. Once again, I am not really sure what I am doing. So I may very well be wrong. Question 2. How does this tell me where to map a natural transformation? Given a $\eta\in\operatorname{Aut}(F)$ , where do I map it? Do I map it as follows $$\eta\mapsto \eta_G(e)?$$ Doing so, do I know that I have exhaustively told where to map every natural transformation? Question 3. I guess I also, somehow, have to use the commutative diagram in the definition of the natural transformation when I construct the group homomorphism, which I haven't done? I guess my suggestion above is not the correct way to do it. Do you have any ideas how I can construct the map?

35,How many homomorphisms and isomorphisms,How many homomorphisms and isomorphisms,,"This is a rather elementary question but I am teaching myself group theory and want to make sure I am getting the basics right! I am considering how many isomorphisms there are $C_n \rightarrow C_n$. For an isomorphism, an element of some order $k$ must be mapped onto an element of order $k$. So I thought that, if $a$ was the generator in the first group, then the homomorphism could map this onto any of the elements $b^i$ in the second group were $b$ generates the second group and $i$ has to be coprime with $n$, because any of the $b^i$ with $i$ being coprime with $n$ can be thought of as the generators for the group of order $n$? Is this correct? Secondly, I am asked how many homomorphisms there are $D_{2n}\rightarrow C_n$ Now for a homomorphism $f$, the order of $f(a)$ must divide the order of $a$. I will call the generator of order n in $D_{2n}$ r, and of order 2 $s$. And I will call a generator of order n in $C_n$ as $a$. Splitting the problem into cases according to the value of n: When n=1 have trivial case that both elements $e,s \in D_{2n}$ are both in the kernel of f When n=2, can choose either $f(r)=a$ and $f(s)=e$ ($e$ the ide9antity) or vice versa to satisfy the 'generator' requirement. For $n>2$, since $f(s)$ can only be order 1 or 2, it must be mapped to the identity and $f(r)=a$. But I am rather stuck as to what happens to the elements in $D_{2n}$ which are of the form $sr^i$ for some $i=1,2,...n-1$. If I consider the simple case of n=2, then I can think of $f(s\bullet r)=f(s)f(r)=ef(r)=a$ by definition for a homomorphism. Now if I consider $f(sr\bullet s)=f(sr)f(s)=f(sr)=f(r)=a$ which happens to be consistent here because $r$ is of order two and is self-inverse, so if we take $srs=ssr^{-1}=r^{-1}$ by definition for the dihedral group, this happens to be $r$ so indeed we get back $f(r)=a$ on the left hand side. But this does not work with any $n>2$ in general. In particular, if I assume as above that $f(s)=e$ and $f(r)=a$, then still the first case where I tried $f(s\bullet r^j)=f(s)f(r^j)=a^j$ suggesting that the $sr^j$ are mapped to $a^j$, like the $r^j$. On the other hand this suggests the second operation becomes $f(sr^j\bullet s)=f(sr^j)f(s)=f(r^j)=a^j$ but by definition for the dihedral group $sr^js=s^2r^{-j}=r^{-j}$, and clearly $f(r{-j})=a^{-j}\neq a^j$!

(I think what I'm looking at can be described as the additive subgroup of $(\Bbb C, +)$ generated by the b th roots of unity: the roots $z_0, z_1 \dots z_{b-1}$ correspond to the turtle commands $F$, $-F+$, $-^2F+^2$, etc. For which $b$ is this group's underlying set dense in $\Bbb C$?

Suppose that the induced action $α_f :\mathbb Z_2 →\mathbb Z^{\times}_4$ carries the generator of $\mathbb Z_2$ to $−1$ . Then $G$ is isomorphic to either $D_8$ or $Q_8$ . Proof Let $\mathbb Z_4 = \langle b \rangle$ and $\mathbb Z_2 = \langle a \rangle$ . For any $x ∈ G$ with $f(x) = a$ , we have $xb^kx^{−1} = α_f (a)(b^k) = b^{−k}$ for all $k$ . Also, $f(x^2) = a^2 = e$ , so $x^2$ ∈ ker f = b. Thus, $x^2$ = $b^k$ for some k. Note that x fails to commute with b and $b^{−1}$ , so neither of these can equal $x^2$ . Thus, either $x^2$ = e or $x^2$ = $b^2$ . If $x^2$ = e, then x has order 2, and hence there is a section of f, specified by s(a)= x. In this case, $G \cong\mathbb  Z_4 \rtimes_{α_f}\mathbb  Z_2$ , which, for this value of $α_f$ , is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_8$ . I'm a bit confused about how they got from $x^2=e$ to $G \cong Z_4 \rtimes_{\alpha_f} Z_2$ . If s(a) = x, then the section $s: Z_2 \rightarrow G$ sends 1 to e and -1 to x, right? So we must have an element of order 2 in G. Additionally, we know that we have a normal subgroup of order 4. However, if we want to construct a semidirect product, we need to make sure that $Z_2$ and $Z_4$ do not have any elements in common, except for the identity, right? But what if $x=b^2$ ? The remaining case gives $x^2 = b^2$ . But then there is a homomorphism $h : Q_8 → G$ with $h(a) = x$ and $h(b) = b$ . In my notes, it says that any group G is isomorphic to $Q_{2n}$ if the following conditions hold: $\bullet$ $x^4=e$ $\bullet$ $b^{2n}=e$ $\bullet$ $x^{-1}bx=b^{-1}$ $\bullet$ $x^2 = b^n$ Of course, in this case, all of the first three conditions hold. But what about the 4th one? We know that $x^2 = b^2 \not= b^4$ . Then how does that homomorphism exist? As the image of h contains more than half the elements of G, h must be onto, and hence an isomorphism. (Alternatively, we could use the Five Lemma for Extensions to show that h is an isomorphism.) I'm not sure if I understand this. The only thing we know about G is that it contains a normal subgroup of order 4, right? So what if we map the group of order 4 in $Q_8$ to the group of order 4 in G? Then we won't ahve mroe than half the elements of G in the image, right? Also, for the Five Lemma for Extensions... in order to use that theorem, we need an extension for $Q_8$ , right? But we're not given any. In other words, we have $\langle b \rangle \rightarrow G \rightarrow \mathbb Z_2$ . But For $Q_8$ , we have $\langle b' \rangle \rightarrow Q_8 \rightarrow ?$ . $Q_8$ , of course, is not a split extension of b by $Z_2$ , for two reasons. First, we know that every element of $Q_8$ which is not in b has order 4, and hence it is impossible to define a section from $Q_8/\langle b \rangle$ to Q8. Second, if it were a split extension, then it would be isomorphic to $D_8$ , which we know is not so. Why is it impossible to define a section? Is it not possible to say $s(a)=b^2$ . I guess this is related to my previous question. We have classified the extensions of Z4 by Z2 corresponding to the homomorphism from $Z_2$ to $Z^{\times}_4$ that takes the generator of $Z_2$ to −1. Since $Z^{\times}_4$ is isomorphic to $Z_2$ , there is only one other homomorphism from $Z_2$ to $Z^{\times}_4$ : the trivial homomorphism.

( Next, the author of the book says: ) It follows that $A_i\cap A_{p+1}=A_j\cap A_{p+1}$ for $i,j<p+1$.

If $c$ and $d$ are the nilpotent classes of $M$ and $N$, the $L = MN$ is nilpotent of class at most $c+d$. There is an exercise on Derek J.S. Robinson's A Course in the Theory of Grouops : If $M,N$ are nontrivial normal nilpotent subgroups of a group, prove that $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. Hence give an alternative proof of Fitting's Theorem for finite groups. The proof of the first part is easy. As $M$ is nontrivial and nilpotent, the center of $M$ is nontrivial. Suppose that $a \in \zeta(M)$, $a \neq 1$, if $a$ commutes with every element of $N$, then $a \in \zeta(MN)$ and $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. If there is some $b \in N$, such that $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \neq 1$, then $aba^{-1}b^{-1} \in \zeta(MN)$, and $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$. On the book, the proof for the general case of Fittng's theorem shows by induction on $i$ that $\gamma_i L$ is the product of all $[X_i, \cdots, X_i]$ with $X_j = M$ or $N$. The fact that $\zeta(MN) \neq 1$ is not applied obviously in this proof. What can I do with this fact when $M$ and $N$ are finite?

Lemma: If H ≤ K ≤ G and U is a G -module that is relatively H -projective, then U is relatively K -projective. Proof: Use Prop 9.1.2 to change definitions of relatively projective back to the good ole relative homological definition I used to like: H -split implies G -split.  Clearly K -split implies H -split just by restricting the direct sum, but then relatively H -projectivity (Prop 9.1.2 style) gives G -split, but this suffices to show relative K -projectivity (Prop 9.1.2 style).  $\square$ However, when I try to do this with $U|(U_H)^G$ I get confused and can't seem to use Mackey correctly.  In Alperin's proof on page 67 he uses a similar but more convenient definition: that U is a direct summand of an induced H -module.  Assuming my previous question is right, this is exactly the same as a direct summand of a relatively free module.  However, I'm not sure I see how $U|(U_H)^G$ is equivalent to $U|S^G$ for some H -module S .  Presumably this is Frobenius reciprocity, but again something is going wrong when I try to do it.

Here $\{H_r\}$ is a sequence of normal subgroups in $G$ with $H_r\supset H_{r+1}$ for all $r$ . Theorem 10.1 The completion and the inverse limit $\displaystyle \lim_{\longleftarrow}\ G/H_r$ are isomorphic under natural mappings. Proof. We give the maps. Let $x=\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence. Given $r$ , for all $n$ sufficiently large, by the definition of Cauchy sequence, the class of $x_n\mod H_r$ is independent of $n$ . Let this class be $x(r)$ .

We leave to the reader to verify that the maps we have defined are inverse isomorphisms between the completion and the inverse limit. I want to see if I'm understanding this correctly (unlikely).

Also, to see that $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy from $(\bar{x_1},\bar{x_2},\dots)$ , I know that $f^n_m(\bar{x_n})=\bar{x_m}$ by definition of the inverse limit, so $\bar{x_n}=\bar{x_m}$ in $G/H_m$ , so $\overline{x_nx_m^{-1}}=\bar{e}\in G/H_m$ , so $x_nx_m^{-1}\in H_m$ . Then given any $H_r$ , for $n,m\geq r$ , $x_nx_m^{-1}\in H_m\subset H_r$ , and $\{x_n\}$ is Cauchy? But then how exactly are the two maps inverses? I didn't quite understand the maps since Lang seems to map a Cauchy sequences $\{x_n\}$ to an element of the inverse limit, but the completion consists of equivalence classes mod the null sequences, so actual Cauchy sequences aren't even elements of the completion $C/C_0$ ?

Below is the full answer to this problem. Thanks goes to Callum and Bart Michels for their hints, that greatly helped to getting this solution. Irreducibility: We have $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{sl}(V)$ a Lie subalgebra. Now note, that by assumption $G$ acts irreducible on $V$ via an representation say $\Phi$ . Let $\phi$ be the associated representation for $\mathfrak{g}$ . To show: $\Phi$ irreducible $\Leftrightarrow$ $\phi$ irreducible: So if we have a subspace of $V$ , invariant under the action of every $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ , it is invariant under $\phi(X)^n$ for all $n$ , since $V$ is finite-dimensional. Hence it must be invariant under $exp(\phi(X))$ . Using that, if $G$ is a connected Lie group, it is generated by exponentials of elements of $\mathfrak{g}$ , we get one implication.  Conversely, if a subspace is invariant under $G$ , it must be invariant under each $\Phi(exp(hX))$ and hence also under the limit $$lim_{h \to 0}\left( \frac{\Phi(exp (hX)) − \Phi(I)}{h}\right) = \phi(X).$$ Semi-simplicity: To show, that $\mathfrak{g}$ is semisimple, we need to prove that the center of $\mathfrak{g}$ is trivial. That is $$\mathfrak{z}(\mathfrak{g})=\{x \in \mathfrak{g}\mid[x,s]=0 ,\forall s \in \mathfrak{g}\}.$$ Since we consider a Lie-subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(V)$ , we have $[x,s]=xs-sx$ . Now, by the irreducibility of the representation together with Schur´s lemma, we have that all elements in the center are multiples of the identity matrix. But since $\mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{sl}(V)$ , and hence the traces need to be zero, we conclude that the center is trivial. Edit: Let $\mathfrak{h}$ be an abelian ideal and $V = \oplus_{\lambda \in\Lambda} V_{\lambda}$ the decomposition of $V$ into joint eigenspaces $$V_{\lambda} = \{v \in V : \forall X \in \mathfrak{h}, (X - \lambda(X))v=0\}.$$ First we show, that forall $\lambda$ we have that $V_{\lambda}$ is $\mathfrak{g}$ -invariant. Let $v \in V_{\lambda}$ , $X \in \mathfrak{h}$ then for any $Y \in \mathfrak{g}$ we note by the comment below $$(X - \lambda(X))Yv = [X,Y]v -\lambda(X)Yv + YXv = [X,Y]v$$ as $v \in V_{\lambda}$ . Observe that $[X,Y] \in \mathfrak{h}$ and so $[X,Y]v \in V_{\lambda}$ , so we have $$(X - \lambda(X))^2Yv = (X - \lambda(X))[X,Y]v=0.$$ Recall that $X \in End(V)$ is said to be diagonalizable, if $V$ has a basis of eigenvectors for $X$ . But this is equivalent to our decomposition $V = \oplus_{\lambda \in\Lambda} V_{\lambda}$ . So $X$ is diagonalizeable. Then, since the generalized eigenspaces coincide with the normal eigenspaces, this imples $Yv \in V_{\lambda}$ . Since by the first part (hopefully), $\mathfrak{g}$ acts irreducible on $V$ , there can only be trivial $\mathfrak{g}$ -invariant subspaces. So with the decomposition above we conclude $V = V_{\lambda}$ for some $\lambda \in \Lambda$ . Hence $\forall v \in V, \forall X \in \mathfrak{h}: (X - \lambda(X))v=0$ , i.e. $\forall v \in V, h \in \mathfrak{h}: Xv=\lambda(X) v$ . So $\mathfrak{h}$ acts by scalars on $V$ . But then again, the elements of $\mathfrak{h}$ being scalar multiples of the identity map, contradicts $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g} \subset \mathfrak{sl}(V)$ as the traces need to be $0$ . So $\mathfrak{h}=0$ .","Let be a connected algebraic group, acting irreducible on , where is a complex vectorspace of dimension I want to show that the Lie algebra of is semisimple and acts irreducible on .
