58,Proving Lebesgue Integration Yields Same Answer As Riemann,Proving Lebesgue Integration Yields Same Answer As Riemann,,"I am working on extended essay for my International Baccalaureate Programme Full Diploma, and I chose mathematics as my topic.  My research questions is: “What are the shortcomings of Riemann integration, why do they exist, and how do other forms of integration overcome those limitations?” The first alternative I will discuss is Lebesgue integration.  By starting with a graphical analysis of a bijective function $f\left( x\right)$ whose limit will be evaluated from $x=a$ to $x=b$, I have attempted to write the process as a unified equation, $$L=\small\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\left[ f^{-1}\left( a+i\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)-f^{-1}\left( a+\left[ i-1\right]\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)\right]\left( a+i\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)\right)$$ By comparison, my formula for Riemann integration follows the form $$R=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f\left( a+\frac{i\left( b-a\right)}{n}\right)\left(\frac{ b-a}{n}\right)$$ I am having extreme difficulty proving that $L=R$, since I do not know how to algebraically evaluate the limit of a series.  However, I did try to test my formulae for $f\left( x\right)=x^2+1$, $a=0$ and $b=a$.  While the formula $R$ has successfully yielded the correct answer under every trial, I have only gotten $L$ to converge to $R$ when integrating symmetrical trigonometric functions; in this case, however, $L$ ended up appearing to be undefined for all $x>0$. Does anyone have any suggestions?  Have I made a key mathematical error? an arithmetical one?  I pulled my information from Arturo Magidin's answer under “Lebesgue Integration Basics.” Thank you for any help you can give.","I am working on extended essay for my International Baccalaureate Programme Full Diploma, and I chose mathematics as my topic.

68,Error in trapezoidal rule via integral mean value theorem,Error in trapezoidal rule via integral mean value theorem,,"During a class, I saw the following analysis of the error term in the trapezoidal rule For $f \in C^2([a,b])$ , $\int_a^b f(x) \,dx - \frac{b-a}{2}[f(a)+f(b)] = -\frac{(b-a)^3}{12}f''(\eta)$ for some $\eta \in (a,b)$ Proof The error is $\int_a^b f(x) - p_1(x)\,dx$ where $p_1$ is the Langrange interpolant of $f$ at $a,b$ . We have $f(x) - p_1(x) = (x-a)(x-b) \frac{f''(\zeta(x))}{2}$ for some $\zeta(x) \in (a,b)$ so by the integral mean value theorem $$\int_a^b f(x) \,dx - \frac{b-a}{2}[f(a)+f(b)] = \int_a^b (x-a)(x-b)\frac{f''(\zeta(x))}{2} \, dx = $$ $$f''(\eta) \int_a^b \frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{2} \,dx \text{ for some } \eta \in (a,b)$$ and then computing the integral gives the result. The derivation I know for the error term for the Lagrange interpolant (in general) involves repeated applications of Rolle's theorem. In particular, the proof of existence of suitable $\zeta(x)$ is non-constructive so we don't know that $\zeta(x)$ is continuous, which I think is a problem for applying the integral mean value theorem since $f''\circ \zeta$ may not be continuous even though $f''$ is. I've since seen this proof in a few different places and all of them pass over this issue without comment. Why is it that we can apply the integral mean value theorem here? Edit: I've changed the proposition to be for $f$ twice continuously differentiable on $[a,b]$ rather than on $(a,b)$ .

I think it's called a hexahedron or 3D-trapezium, not sure. None of the first 4 points are the same as any other, and the last four points line in a plane. Here's a picture:","If there a closed form expression for the volume enclosed by 8 points $(x_1, y_1, 0)$, $(x_2, y_2, 0)$, $(x_3, y_3, 0)$, $(x_4, y_4, 0)$, $(x_1, y_1, h_1)$, $(x_2, y_2, h_2)$, $(x_3, y_3, h_3)$ and $(x_4, y_4, h_4)$?
