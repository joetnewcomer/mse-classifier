We have a pool of $n$ people, each of whom is supposed to be assigned another member of the pool to find a gift for, without the recipient knowing whom they've been assigned to.

Obviously we could use a trusted third party or online organizer to do this, but that's not much fun to do at a party, so it'd be better if we could use some method that could be implemented by hand, solely by the participants. While everyone should ideally have an equal chance of getting assigned to everyone else, it's probably okay if our algorithm is nonuniform over cycle types.

I received the following question as part of my Discrete Mathematics course and am unable to solve it. How many strings of four decimal digits that do not contain the same digit three times? I know that it is related to counting rules and involves the product and sum rules however, I can not decide what approach to take to solve. What I have so far: 1) Solution 1 Total number of combinations = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 10 ^ 4 = 10 000 Number of combinations where the string contains the same digit three times: 1 * 1 * 1 * 10 = 10 * 10 (since 0 - 9 are possible numbers that can be repeated) = 100 Number of combinations where the string does not contain the same digit three times: 10 000 - 100 = 9 900 Help Needed: I do not know if this is correct. If it isn't, I would be very appreciative if someone could direct me to the correct method for solving the problem.",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Alice and Bob play a fairly simple game with $n$ predefined points in 3D space. No four points are complanar (which also implies that no three points are collinear).

67,A combinatorial interpretation of a counting problen,A combinatorial interpretation of a counting problen,,"This question is about a surprising formula that is the answer to a counting problem. To me it suggests that there might just be a nice combinatorial interpretation of the problem that I have not yet found. Even if there is not, I'm sure there are much more elegant solutions than mine. The problem Suppose we have an $n\times m$ grid of squares with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. In every square we write the number of rectangles that can be made inside the grid and in which it is contained. Consider for example the green square in the image below. We see that it is contained in $8$ rectangles that can be made inside this $2 \times 3$ grid. If we count this number for every square we get. Now let $f(n,m)$ denote the sum of these numbers, so $f(2,3)=4 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 8=40$. The task is to find a general formula for $f(n,m)$. My solution Consider the square with coordinates $(i,j)$, as in the image below. Any rectangle that it is contained in must have its top left corner in the area shown in red. Its bottom right corner must be in the area shown in blue. So the square $(i,j)$ is contained in exactly $\color{red}{ i \cdot j} \cdot \color{blue}{ \left( n - i + 1 \right) \cdot \left( m - j + 1 \right)}$ rectangles. Now we only need to sum over all squares to get  $$ f(n,m)= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m \left [ i \cdot j \cdot  \left( n - i + 1 \right) \cdot \left( m - j + 1 \right) \right ].$$ To make this calculation a little easier we can introduce $S_n = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n i$ and $T_n = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n i^2$ so that  \begin{align*} f(n,m) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m \left [ i \cdot j \cdot  \left( n - i + 1 \right) \cdot \left( m - j + 1 \right) \right ] \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m \left [ i^2 j^2 - m\cdot i^2 j -i^2 j - n \cdot i j^2 -i j^2+ n m \cdot i j+ m \cdot i j + n \cdot i j +i j \right ] \\ &= T_n T_m - m\cdot T_n S_m - T_n S_m - n \cdot S_n T_m - S_n T_m + n m \cdot S_n S_m + m \cdot S_n S_m + n \cdot S_n S_m + S_n S_m  \\ &= \left(S_n + n\cdot S_n - T_n\right)\cdot \left(S_m + m\cdot S_m - T_m\right) \end{align*} Now we can use the well known formulas for $S_n$ and $T_n$ to find that  $$ S_n + n\cdot S_n - T_n = \frac{1}{6} n (n+1) (n+2) = \binom{n+2}{3}. $$ Putting this together we get that  $$ f(n,m) = \binom{n+2}{3} \cdot \binom{m+2}{3}. $$ I was pretty surprised by the simple nature of this answer.

Can anyone give me hint on how to do this?","This question already has answers here : How to show $\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n+k}{k}\frac{1}{2^k}=2^{n}$ (16 answers) Closed 7 years ago . The problem is to prove the following statement for all natural numbers. $$f(n)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n+k}{k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k=2^n$$ I already proved this using mathematical induction. But, my instinct is telling me that there is some kind of combinatorial/algebraic method that can be used to solve this easily. (Unless my instinct is wrong.) Can anyone give me hint on how to do this?",,"['combinatorics', 'algebra-precalculus']"

95,Prove the generating function for the Catalan number sequence is $f(x) = \frac{1 -\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$,Prove the generating function for the Catalan number sequence is,f(x) = \frac{1 -\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x},"I know that generating function for the Catalan number sequence is $$f(x) = \frac{1 -\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$$ but I want to prove it. The sequence for the Catalan numbers is $$1,1,2,5,14, \dots$$ as we all know. Now I have to find a generating function that generates this sequence. I read that we can prove it this way: Assume that $f(x)$ is the generating function for the Catalan sequence then by the Cauchy product rule it can be shown that $xf(x)^2 = f(x) − 1$ . And so this implies that $$xf(x)^2 - f(x) + 1 = 0$$ and so we can get that $$f(x) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$$ But I don't understand how this is possible. How to apply the Cauchy product rule to obtain $xf(x)^2 = f(x) − 1$ ? I know that if we multiply the sequence $$1,1,2,5,14, \dots$$ by itself we would get in the resulting sequence $$1,1,5,14,...$$ Because we have that $c_k = a_0b_k + a_1b_{k-1}+ ........ + a_kb_0$ using the cauchy product formula. But still, how do we have that $xf(x)^2 = f(x) − 1$ and how did we get that $$f(x) = \frac{1-\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$$ from $xf(x)^2 = f(x) − 1$ ?
