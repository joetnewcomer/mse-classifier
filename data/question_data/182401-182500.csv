1,Finite groups of functions under function composition,Finite groups of functions under function composition,,"Over the years I have done many questions along the lines of the following: ""Given functions $\phi, \theta$ (usually defined on $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, or a suitable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) prove that the collection of all functions obtained from $\theta$ and $\phi$ by function composition form a group G."" (Frequently G is $\mathbb{Z}/4 \mathbb{Z}$ or $S_3$.) A typical example might be functions $\theta:x\mapsto 1-x$ and $\phi:x\mapsto \frac{1}{x}$, (defined on the set of non-zero reals) generating a group isomorphic to $S_3$. When I have been inventing questions for my students, rather than simply copying examples from previous exam papers, I have sometimes wondered if it is possible to create a similar example with a function $\psi$ which has order 5 in the group - just for a bit of variety!

My question is then: does anyone know of such a function, or has anyone come across a similar exam question which gives an element of order 5 (or 7 for that matter ...) arising from such a simple type of function?

2,On sort-of-linear functions: does $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ imply $f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x)$?,On sort-of-linear functions: does  imply ?,f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x),"Background A function $ f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \ $ is linear if it satisfies $$ f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) \ \text {, and} \tag 1 \label 1 $$ $$ f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x) \tag 2 \label 2 $$ for all $ x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n $ and all $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} $ . A function satisfying only \eqref{2} is not necessarily linear.  For example* $ f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} \ $ defined by $ f(x) = |x| \ $ (where $ |x| \ $ is the $ L^2 $ norm) satisfies \eqref{2} but is not linear .  However, a function satisfying \eqref{1} does satisfy a weaker version of \eqref{2}, namely $$ f(ax)=af(x) \tag {2b} \label {2b} $$ for all $ a \in \mathbb{Q} $ . *Edit:  As pointed out in the comments this example doesn't quite work since $|ax|=|a||x|$ . When $ f $ is continuous it's relatively straight-forward to show that under the extra hypothesis that $ f $ is continuous, \eqref{2b} implies \eqref{2}.  I want to say that continuity is a necessary condition for \eqref{1} to imply \eqref{2}, or at least (worst) there is some extra hypothesis required (possibly weaker than continuity), but I'm not sure how to show it.

What are some examples (if there are any) of a function satisfying \eqref{1} but not \eqref{2}? This can be stated in a slightly more general context as follows: Suppose $ V\ $ is a vector space over $ \mathbb{R}\ $ and $ f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\ $ satisfies $$ f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y) \tag {1'} $$ for all $ x,y \in V $ . Under what conditions is $ f\ $ a vector space homomorphism? The reason I believe continuity is necessary is because of the similarity to the fact that $ x^{\alpha} x^{\beta} = x^{\alpha + \beta} $ for all $ \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R} $ .  Irrational powers can be defined either via continuity (i.e. if $ \alpha \ $ is irrational, then $ x^{\alpha}:= \lim_{q\to \alpha} x^q \ $ where q takes on only rational values) or by using the exponential and natural logarithm functions, and either way proving the desired identity boils down to continuity.

8,What is the right way to define a function?,What is the right way to define a function?,,"Most authors define functions this way: Given the sets $A$ and $B$ . A relation is a subset of $A\times B$ . Then given a relation $R$ , we define $Dom_R=\{x|(x,y)\in R\}$ and $Img_R=\{x|(y,x)\in R\}$ . Then a function from $A$ to $B$ , $f:A\rightarrow B$ , is a relation with the property that each element of the domain is related to exactly one element of the image, such that $Dom_f=A$ and $Img_f\subseteq B$ . Well, if we accept those definitions, functions are just special sets of ordered pairs (remember, functions are relations and, as far as I know, this is emphasized in most books). Specifying the set of inputs and the set of outputs is just necessary when describing functions using the axiom of replacement of ZFC, but what really dictates which set is which is its elements. Thus, for example, the function \begin{align}f:\{0,1\}&\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\0&\mapsto2\\1&\mapsto 3\end{align} and the function \begin{align}g:\{0,1\}&\rightarrow \{2,3\}\\0&\mapsto2\\1&\mapsto 3\end{align} are the same, since both are the set $\{(0,2),(1,3)\}$ . The thing is that $g$ is considered a surjection while $f$ is not. And this is really a problem. Furthermore, the concept of a graph of a function $Gr(f)$ , which is the set $\{(x,f(x))|x\in Dom_f\}$ , loses its sense, since the graph would be the function itself. Wouldn't be much better to define the function as an ordered triple $(A,B,f)$ , where $A$ is the domain, $B$ the codomain and $f$ the relation with the properties described above? It's different, since $f$ itself would not be a function, but only the ordered triple would. Then we could define $Gr((A,B,f)):=f$ . In this case, the graph of the function would be a relation instead of the function. Also, the notation $f:A\rightarrow B$ could still be used to describe $(A,B,f)$ . To force the function to be a relation, we would have to define relation the same way: the relation would also be an ordered triple $(A,B,R)$ , where $R \subseteq A\times B$ . But in this case, the relation is not a set of ordered pairs, but the 'graph of the relation' is. The third and last option is to define both relation and function as a set of ordered pairs, as usually.

Another way to prove this is to first construct the inverse function, show that it is well defined, and then show that $ff^{-1}$ and $f^{-1}f$ are the identity functions, right? So if we let $g_{\alpha}=g_{\beta}$, then $\alpha=\beta$, because otherwise $g_{\alpha} (\beta)=0$ and $g_{\beta} (\beta)=1$; a contradiction. Now we have $f \circ f^{-1} (g_{\alpha}) = f(\alpha) = g_{\alpha}$ and $f^{-1} \circ f(\alpha) = f^{-1}(g_{\alpha}) = \alpha$ , and so $f$ and $f^{-1}$ must be bijective.",,['elementary-set-theory']
11,"Compositional ""square roots""","Compositional ""square roots""",,"Let $A$ be a set and $f\colon A\to A$ a function. The primary and general question is: What conditions are necessary so that there exists $g$ such that for each $x$ in $A$, $g(g(x))=f(x)$? This is a rather broad question, so a few more specific questions that result: Is there actually some primary literature or result for this problem? Or perhaps for some subproblem such as functions on the reals? Edit to clarify where the questions below arise from: Consider the case of $ f $ bijective. For this case, Qiaochu Yuan demonstrated here that $ f $ has a compositional square root exactly when the number of even (or infinite) cycles occuring in iteration of $ f $ is even or infinite. For infinite cycles: $ \{..., x_{-2}, x_{-1}, x_0, x_1, x_2, ...\} $ where $ x_{i+1} = f(x_i) $. If this already covers $ A $ and specifically, there is only one of these structures, there also is no compositional square root: Assume there was $ g $ with $ g(g)=f $, then $ g(x_0) = x_n $ for some $ 0 \neq n \in \mathbb{Z} $, and then $ g(x_1) = g(f(x_0)) = g(g(g(x_0))) = g(g(x_n)) = f(x_n) = x_{n+1} $. Inductively, then, $ g(x_i) = x_{n+i} $ for all $ i>0 $, but then $ g(g(x_{n}))=f(x_{n})=x_{n+1}=g(x_{n}) $ and that's a contradiction. An example of such a function is $ f: \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z} $, $f(x) = x+1 $. However, if A actually partitions into two components of the double-sided path form $ \{..., x_{-2}, x_{-1}, x_0, x_1, x_2, ...\} $ and $ \{..., y_{-2}, y_{-1}, y_0, y_1, y_2, ...\} $, then we can create $ g $ by defining it through $ g(x_i)=y_i $ and $ g(y_i)=x_{i+1} $. An example for this is $ f: \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z} $, $f(x) = x+2 $ - the components here are the even and odd numbers, and we create $ g $ by jumping between even and odd: $ g(x)=x+1 $. There was some discussion on another forum a while ago, which brought some partial results (such as: For $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ bijective and strictly monotonic such a $g$ exists); it seems that any such conditions are related to a kind of ""pairability"" of graphs generated by iterated application of $f$ (so that $g$ can ""jump"" between such graphs) and thus to graph theory, specifically infinite pseudo-trees. All literature on those seems to be algorithmically motivated and thus only for the (comparatively simple) finite case; i.e. finite A. Is there any literature on infinite pseudo-trees that might be relevant? Another aspect leads to set theoretic questions: The mentioned graphs are going to be equivalence classes under the equivalence relation $S$ on $A$ defined as  $$xSy \iff\text{ There is }n \in \mathbb{N}\text{ with }f^n(x) = y\text{ or }f^n(y) = x.$$  These subsets are then, under iteration of $f$, the mentioned pseudo-trees, and the cardinalities of each preimage matter (since bijections are needed for said ""pairing"" of such trees). But even when acting on the reals, without CH it is not clear which cardinalities can be ""paired off"". And similarly, the cardinality of the height of such graphs seems relevant. Assuming CH for any relevant statement seems rather strong though, so the set-theoretic question is which other strengthenings of ZFC might be relevant here? An example to explain the above question: $ A = B \bigcup C \bigcup \{d\} \bigcup \{e\} $, $ B $ and $ C $ countable with fixed enumeration and $ f: A \to A $ with $ f(b_i) := c_i $,  $ f(c_i) := d $, $ f(d) := e $ and $ f(e):=d $ Claim: Then $ f $ does not have a compositional square root. Assume $ g $ with $ g(g)=f $. For arbitrary $ b \in B $ consider $ g(b) $. Cases: $ g(b) = d $ or $ g(b) = e $ lead to immediate contradictions due to $ g(g(b_i)) = f(b_i) $ being different for different i. Assume $ g(b) = c $ for some $ c \in C $. Then $ g(c) = f(b) \in C $ and thus $ d = f(g(c)) = g(f(c)) = g(d) $, but then $ g(g(d)) = d \neq f(d) $, contradiction. Thus, $ g(b) \in B $ for all b, but this is a contradiction as well, and so no such g can exist. But now consider two copies of our set: $ A^1 = B^1 \bigcup C^1 \bigcup \{d^1\} \bigcup \{e^1\} $ and $ A^2 = B^2 \bigcup C^2 \bigcup \{d^2\} \bigcup \{e^2\} $ and f defined on $ A = A^1 \bigcup A^2 $ as above for $ A^1 $ and $ A^2 $. Now $ g(g)=f $ exists: $ g(b^1_i) = b^2_i $, $ g(b^2_i) = d^1 $ , $ g(d^1) = d^2 $, $ g(d^2) = e^1 $, $ g(e^1) = e^2 $ and $ g(e^2) = d^1 $. Note that $ A^1 $ and $ A^2 $ are equivalence classes under S and that these satisfy the definition of ""pairability"" below. And now, finally, here is where cardinalities matter: This construction does not work if $ card(B^1) = card(C^1) \neq card(B^2) = card (C^2) $ as it assumes bijections. CH greatly simplifies which cardinalities there are to consider, but it is a rather strong assumption. The question, then, is which axioms in addition to ZFC help with simplifying the cardinalities to consider in scenarios like this, especially considering that the structures defined here can be seen as directed trees. Lastly, while it seems that the definition of ""pairable"" can be made rigorous like this: two such equivalence classes $R$ and $S$ are pairable for $f$ if and only if there exists functions $h\colon S\to T$ and $j\colon T\to S$ such that for all  $s \in S$, $j(h(s))=f(s)$ and for all $t \in T$,  $h(j(t))=f(t)$. But then it gets a bit murky: what we need is that every equivalence class can be paired with another one (or itself), but is stating that there exists a partition of the equivalence classes into groups of pairables equivalent to the existence of $g(g)=f$? It seems that ""$\Rightarrow$"" holds, but the other direction is less clear. Is it possible to have a case where $g$ can jump between more than two classes that would not be reducible to a ""pairable"" case?

46,How does the common definition of a function satisfy the precise definition of a function?,How does the common definition of a function satisfy the precise definition of a function?,,"Before my reading on Linear Algebra by Hoffman/Kunze, I was under the impression that a function was "" a rule (or mathematical object) that maps/assigns each $x \in X$ (domain) to an element $y \in Y$ (codomain) "". However, stumbling across Hoffman/Kunze's LA book, in the appendix, it defines a functions as a mathematical object which consists of: Domain $\longrightarrow$ set of possible inputs Co-domain $\longrightarrow$ set of possible values outputted Rule $\longrightarrow$ associates each element in the domain to a single element in the codomain This got me confused as I previously interpreted the rule being the whole function, not being only a part of the function. This changed my understanding because functions were no longer just ""a rule that maps..."" but instead an object that consisted of a rule and other parts. I did some researching and stumbled across a few ""more precise"" (but less common) definitions where it also stated that function as three parts. For example, Joe's answer here states that a function is... Definition. A function is an (ordered) triple ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ), where $X$ and $Y$ are sets, and $f$ is a subset of $X \times Y$ satisfying the following properties: For every $x \in X$ , there is a $y \in Y$ such that ( $x$ , $y$ ) $\in f$ . For every $x \in X$ , and for all $z$ , $z' \in Y$ , if ( $x$ , $z$ ) $\in f$ and ( $x$ , $z'$ ) $\in f$ then $z=z'$ .

I told myself that the reason why the less precise definition of the function defined it as a rule was because of something that Joe and my LA book mentioned in common. Taken from the same answer by Joe, it says: Commentary. If our definition is to be taken seriously, then $f$ is not the function: rather it is the graph of the function. Nevertheless, it is conventional to abuse notation and refer to the triple ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ) as $f$ for short. Similarly, in Hoffman/Kunze's LA book, it comments: If ( $X$ , $Y$ , $f$ ) is a function, we shall also say $f$ is a function from $X$ into $Y$ . This is a bit sloppy, since it is not $f$ which is the function; $f$ is the rule of the function. However, this use of the same symbol for the function and its rule provides one with a much more tractable way of speaking about functions. To clarify, I told/convinced myself that functions are commonly defined as rules because people would ""sloppily"" abuse the notation $f$ and refer it to both the function and its rule, which therefore caused an adaptation to the definition of a function being a rule.

58,A function satisfying $f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x$ [duplicate],A function satisfying  [duplicate],f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x,"This question already has answers here : Is there a function whose inverse is exactly the reciprocal of the function, that is $f^{-1} = \frac{1}{f}$? (6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Background . This question originates from the problem of finding a function $f$ such that its $n$-th iterate is equal to its $n$-th power, which I asked about here . Now I would like to focus on the related case $n = -1$, because it seems to be quite a different problem. In other words, I am looking for a function $f$ such that its compositional inverse is equal to its multiplicative inverse, that is, $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac 1 {f(x)}.$$ It is immediate to see that this is equivalent to $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x$$ which is the equation in the title. I believe I have found an example of a function $f \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+$ satisfying the equation, but it is quite convoluted. The construction is as follows: Let $x \in \mathbb Q^+$. Then we can write $$x = \left ( \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}} \right )^n$$ where $p_1, \dotsc, p_h, q_1, \dotsc, q_k$ are distinct prime factors, $p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h} \le q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}$, the exponents $a_1, \dotsc, a_h, b_1, \dotsc, b_k$ are coprime positive integers, and $n \in \mathbb Z$. Then we define $$\rho \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+ \qquad \rho (x) = \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}}.$$ Clearly the image $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$ is countably infinite, so we can fix two sequences $(r_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ and $(s_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ such that: $$r_0, s_0, r_1, s_1, \dotsc, r_m, s_m, \dotsc$$ is an injective enumeration of $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$. Notice then that each $x \in \mathbb Q^+$ is either $r_m^n$ or $s_m^n$ for some $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$, in a unique way. Therefore, we define $$f(r_m^n) = s_m^n \qquad f(s_m^n) = r_m^{-n}$$ for all $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$. With this definition, we can check that the above property is satisfied: $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(r_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {s_m^n} \right ) = f (s_m^{-n}) = r_m^n$$ $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(s_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {r_m^{-n}} \right ) = f (r_m^n) = s_m^n.$$ My questions are: Are there any less artificial functions satisfying the equation? If so, is there such a function that is defined on an interval of $\mathbb R$? Remark . If $f$ is defined on an interval $I$ of $\mathbb R$ and is always positive (or negative), then it is monotonic.

(6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Background . This question originates from the problem of finding a function $f$ such that its $n$-th iterate is equal to its $n$-th power, which I asked about here . Now I would like to focus on the related case $n = -1$, because it seems to be quite a different problem. In other words, I am looking for a function $f$ such that its compositional inverse is equal to its multiplicative inverse, that is, $$f^{-1}(x) = \frac 1 {f(x)}.$$ It is immediate to see that this is equivalent to $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x$$ which is the equation in the title. I believe I have found an example of a function $f \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+$ satisfying the equation, but it is quite convoluted. The construction is as follows: Let $x \in \mathbb Q^+$. Then we can write $$x = \left ( \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}} \right )^n$$ where $p_1, \dotsc, p_h, q_1, \dotsc, q_k$ are distinct prime factors, $p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h} \le q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}$, the exponents $a_1, \dotsc, a_h, b_1, \dotsc, b_k$ are coprime positive integers, and $n \in \mathbb Z$. Then we define $$\rho \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+ \qquad \rho (x) = \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}}.$$ Clearly the image $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$ is countably infinite, so we can fix two sequences $(r_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ and $(s_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ such that: $$r_0, s_0, r_1, s_1, \dotsc, r_m, s_m, \dotsc$$ is an injective enumeration of $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$. Notice then that each $x \in \mathbb Q^+$ is either $r_m^n$ or $s_m^n$ for some $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$, in a unique way. Therefore, we define $$f(r_m^n) = s_m^n \qquad f(s_m^n) = r_m^{-n}$$ for all $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$. With this definition, we can check that the above property is satisfied: $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(r_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {s_m^n} \right ) = f (s_m^{-n}) = r_m^n$$ $$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(s_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {r_m^{-n}} \right ) = f (r_m^n) = s_m^n.$$ My questions are: Are there any less artificial functions satisfying the equation? If so, is there such a function that is defined on an interval of $\mathbb R$? Remark . If $f$ is defined on an interval $I$ of $\mathbb R$ and is always positive (or negative), then it is monotonic. Indeed, if $f$ were increasing we would have $$x_1 < x_2 \implies f(x_1) < f(x_2) \implies \frac 1 {f(x_1)} > \frac 1 {f(x_2)} \implies x_1 > x_2$$ and similarly if $f$ were decreasing.",,"['functions', 'functional-equations', 'inverse-function']"

88,Proof that there exists a unique function $f:\emptyset \rightarrow \emptyset$ and this function is a bijection. Is my proof valid?,Proof that there exists a unique function  and this function is a bijection. Is my proof valid?,f:\emptyset \rightarrow \emptyset,"First, these are the definitions I'm working with: A function can be defined by its domain, codomain and graph, so $g:A \rightarrow B$ is equal to the ordered triplet $g = (A, B, G)$ where $G \subseteq A \times B$ . Also, for it to be a function, $G$ must satisfy the following: 1 - $(\forall x)[x \in A \rightarrow (\exists y)(y \in B \land (x, y) \in G)]$ (Every element has an image) 2 - $(\forall x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) [((x_1, y_1) \in G \land (x_2, y_2) \in G \land x_1 = x_2) \rightarrow y_1 = y_2]$ (The image of every element is unique) A function $g:A \rightarrow B$ is an injection if: $(\forall a_1, a_2 \in A) (g(a_1) = g(a_2) \rightarrow a_1  = a_2)$ A function $g:A \rightarrow B$ is a surjection if: $(\forall b \in B) (\exists a \in A)(g(a) = b)$ A function $g:A \rightarrow B$ is a bijection if: It is both an injection and a surjection. Now, first we need to determine, is there actually a function $f:\emptyset \rightarrow \emptyset$ ? If there is, then $f = (\emptyset, \emptyset, G)$ where $G \subseteq \emptyset \times \emptyset = \emptyset$ . This then mean that $G = \emptyset$ (by double inclusion). Then $f = (\emptyset, \emptyset, \emptyset)$ . Now, is this a function? Well it's just a matter of verifying that the two properties listed above hold for $\emptyset$ : 1- $(\forall x)[x \in \emptyset \rightarrow (\exists y)(y \in \emptyset \land (x, y) \in \emptyset)]$ . And this is vacuously true since $x \in \emptyset$ is always false. 2 - $(\forall x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) [((x_1, y_1) \in \emptyset \land (x_2, y_2) \in \emptyset \land x_1 = x_2) \rightarrow y_1 = y_2]$ . Similarly, this is also vacuously true since $(x_1, y_1) \in \emptyset$ is always false, which impies $((x_1, y_1) \in \emptyset \land (x_2, y_2) \in \emptyset \land x_1 = x_2)$ is always false, which then implies that the complete statement is always true. So then $f = (\emptyset, \emptyset, \emptyset)$ is a function and is the only function that can be defined from $\emptyset$ to $\emptyset$ . To prove that $f$ is a bijection, we first prove that it is an injection and then that it is a surjection. First notice that $(\forall a_1, a_2 \in \emptyset) (f(a_1) = f(a_2) \rightarrow a_1  = a_2)$ can be rewritten as $(\forall a_1, a_2)(a_1 \in \emptyset \rightarrow (a_2 \in \emptyset \rightarrow (f(a_1) = f(a_2) \rightarrow a_1  = a_2)))$ . This is probably the part of the proof that I'm most unsure of. Looking at the second form of the definition of injectivity is clear that $f$ is injective since the statement is vacuously true. To prove that the function is surjective, suppose that it isn't, then $\neg (\forall b \in \emptyset) (\exists a \in \emptyset)(f(a) = b)$ is a true statement, then $(\exists b \in \emptyset) (\forall a \in \emptyset)(f(a) \neq b)$ , which is clearly false since there is no element in $\emptyset$ , hence a contradiction. Then the function is surjective and injective thus bijective, this concludes the proof. Are there any spots where my proof doesn't hold? can it be improved? Please let me know!","First, these are the definitions I'm working with: A function can be defined by its domain, codomain and graph, so is equal to the ordered triplet where . Also, for it to be a function, must satisfy the following: 1 - (Every element has an image) 2 - (The image of every element is unique) A function is an injection if: A function is a surjection if: A function is a bijection if: It is both an injection and a surjection. Now, first we need to determine, is there actually a function ? If there is, then where . This then mean that (by double inclusion). Then . Now, is this a function? Well it's just a matter of verifying that the two properties listed above hold for : 1- . And this is vacuously true since is always false. 2 - . Similarly, this is also vacuously true since is always false, which impies is always false, which then implies that the complete statement is always true. So then is a function and is the only function that can be defined from to . To prove that is a bijection, we first prove that it is an injection and then that it is a surjection. First notice that can be rewritten as . This is probably the part of the proof that I'm most unsure of. Looking at the second form of the definition of injectivity is clear that is injective since the statement is vacuously true. To prove that the function is surjective, suppose that it isn't, then is a true statement, then , which is clearly false since there is no element in , hence a contradiction.

For a given $y$ value on the $y=f(x+a)$ graph, the $x$ value needed for it must be $a$ smaller than the $x$ value needed if it was just the function $y=f(x)$ ; hence the graph $y=f(x+a)$ must be the graph of $y=f(x)$ but shifted $a$ units to the negative $x$ direction.

It starts with one apple at the top. The next layer is 2x2, then 3x3, and so on. How many apples are there, given x number of layers? The polynomial function $$f(x) = \frac{2x^3 + 3x^2 + x}{6}$$ What I do and don't understand Thanks to @DJC, I now know this is a standard function to generate Square Pyramidal Numbers , which is part of Faulhaber's formula . Faulhaber's formula appears to be about quickly adding sequential coefficients which all have the same exponent. Very cool. But how does one get from: $$\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^p$$ to the spiffy function above? If I'm sounding stupid, how do I make the question better? Fwiw, I'm in intermediate algebra in the USA. The next course would be Trigonometry or Calculus. (to help people place my current knowledge level)",,"['functions', 'polynomials', 'summation']"
99,"If $f \circ g = f$, prove that $f$ is a constant function.","If , prove that  is a constant function.",f \circ g = f f,"Suppose $A$ is a nonempty set and $f: A \rightarrow A$ and for all $g:A \rightarrow A,$ $f \circ g = f$. Prove that $f$ is a constant function. This result seems obvious, but I can't seem to find a way to prove it. The book I got this problem from hinted that the reader should consider what would happen if $g$ were a constant function. I considered that case and it was easy to prove that $f$ was a constant function, but I can't find any way to prove it when $g$ is not a constant function. At this point I'm not really sure how to approach this problem anymore.
