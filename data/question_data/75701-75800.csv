Since $U_1$ is dense in $X$, there is $y_1\in U_1$ with $d(x,y_1)<\epsilon$. Also, as $U_1$ is open, there is $r_1>0$ with $B(y_1;r_1)\subset U_1$. Then, we can arrange $r_1<1$ such that  $\overline{B(y_1;r_1)} \subset U_1\cap B(x;\epsilon)$. Now my question is why we can arrange that the closure will be contained in each of them? I think intuitively it sounds correct, but I didn't succeed to prove it rigorously. Can you please help me here?",,"['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'baire-category']"

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, let $p \in X$, and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. Then $f$ is said to be continuous at point $p$ if, for every open set $V$ in $Y$ such that $f(p) \in V$, there is an open set $U$ in $X$ such that $p \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. Now here is Prob. 6, Sec. 18: Find a function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at precisely one point. My Attempt: Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by    $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ x \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}. \end{cases} $$ First, let $p \colon= 0$. Then $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ of course, and so $f(p) = 0$. Let $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be any sequence of real numbers such that    $$ \lim_{ n \to \infty } x_n = p = 0. \tag{0} $$   Then, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$ f \left( x_n \right) = \begin{cases} 0 \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x_n \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ x_n \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x_n \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}. \end{cases} $$ If $\left( x_n \right)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ has only finitely many rational terms, then there is a natural number $N$ such that $x_n \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ for all $n > N$, and so $f \left( x_n \right) = x_n$ for all $n > N$. Therefore,    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 0 = f(p), $$   by (0) above. If $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ has only finitely many irrational terms, then there is a natural number $N$ such that $x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ for all $n > N$, and so $f \left( x_n \right) = 0$ for all $n > N$. Therefore,    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = 0 = f(p). $$ Now suppose that $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ has infinitely many rational terms and infinitely many irrational terms. Then there are strictly increasing functions $\phi \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and    $\psi \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that    $$ \phi( \mathbb{N} ) \cap \psi ( \mathbb{N} ) = \emptyset, \qquad  \phi( \mathbb{N} ) \cup \psi ( \mathbb{N} ) = \mathbb{N},  \qquad   x_{\phi(n)} \in \mathbb{Q}, \qquad x_{\psi(n)} \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}.  \tag{1} $$   Then for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$ f \left( x_{ \phi(n) }  \right) = 0, \qquad  f \left( x_{ \psi(n) }  \right) = x_{\psi(n)} .$$   So    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty } f \left( x_{ \phi(n) }  \right) = 0, \qquad \lim_{n \to \infty } f \left( x_{ \psi(n) }  \right) = x_{\psi(n)}  = p = 0. \tag{2} $$   Here we have used the fact that, since $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $p$, therefore every subsequence of $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ also converges to $p$. Moreover we have taken $p$ to be $0$ here. From (1) and (2) we can conclude that    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = 0 = f(0) = f(p), $$   as required. Thus we have shown that the image sequence $\left( f \left( x_n \right)  \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ of every sequence $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ that converges to $p = 0$ converges to $f(p) = 0$. So $f$ is continuous at $p = 0$. Next, suppose that $p \neq 0$. If $p$ is rational, then $f(p) = 0$. Let $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ be a sequence of irrational numbers converging to $p$. Then    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty } x_n = p \neq 0 = f(p).  $$    On the other hand, if $p$ is irrational, then $f(p) = p \neq  0$. Let    $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ be a sequence of rational numbers converging to $p$. Then    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty } 0 = 0 \neq p = f(p).  $$    Thus we have shown that $f$ cannot be continuous at any real  $p$ such that $p \neq 0$. Is what I have done so far correct? However, so far in Munkres, we do not have the sequential criterion for continuity at our disposal. So we must have recourse to the definition given above. Let $V$ be an open set in the range space $\mathbb{R}$ such that    $$0 = f(0) \in V.$$   Then there is an open interval $(c, d)$ such that $$0 \in (c, d) \subset V. $$ Now what should be our open set $U$ in the domain space $\mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$? Now suppose that $p \neq 0$. First, suppose $p$ is irrational. Then $f(p) = p \neq 0$, and there is an open interval $(a, b)$ such that $p \in (a, b)$ and $0 \not\in (a, b)$. Let us take $V \colon= (a, b)$. Then $V$ is open in the range space $\mathbb{R}$ and $f(p) \in V$. However, if $U$ is any open set in the domain space $\mathbb{R}$ such that $p \in U$, then there is an open interval $(c, d)$ such that $p \in (c, d) \subset U$. But    $$ f \left( \ (c, d) \ \right) = \left[ \ (c, d) \cap (\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q} ) \ \right] \cup \left\{ \ 0 \ \right\} \not\subset V, $$   because $0 \not\in V$. But as $(c, d) \subset U$, so $ f \left( \ (c, d) \ \right) \subset f(U)$. Therefore $f(U) \not\subset V$. Now suppose that $p$ is rational and $p \neq 0$. Then $f(p) = 0$. Let $V$ be the open interval $(-1, 1)$. Then $V$ is open in the range space $\mathbb{R}$, and $f(p) \in V$. However, if $U$ is any open set in the domain space $\mathbb{R}$ such that $p \in U$, then we can find an open interval $(a, b)$ such that $p \in (a, b) \subset U$ and such that $0 \not\in (a, b)$. What next? How to proceed from here?","Here is the definition of continuity given in Theorem 18.1 in Topology by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, let $p \in X$, and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. Then $f$ is said to be continuous at point $p$ if, for every open set $V$ in $Y$ such that $f(p) \in V$, there is an open set $U$ in $X$ such that $p \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. Now here is Prob. 6, Sec. 18: Find a function $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ that is continuous at precisely one point. My Attempt: Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by    $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ x \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}. \end{cases} $$ First, let $p \colon= 0$. Then $p \in \mathbb{Q}$ of course, and so $f(p) = 0$. Let $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be any sequence of real numbers such that    $$ \lim_{ n \to \infty } x_n = p = 0. \tag{0} $$   Then, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$ f \left( x_n \right) = \begin{cases} 0 \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x_n \in \mathbb{Q}, \\ x_n \ & \ \mbox{ if } \ x_n \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}. \end{cases} $$ If $\left( x_n \right)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ has only finitely many rational terms, then there is a natural number $N$ such that $x_n \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ for all $n > N$, and so $f \left( x_n \right) = x_n$ for all $n > N$. Therefore,    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = 0 = f(p), $$   by (0) above. If $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ has only finitely many irrational terms, then there is a natural number $N$ such that $x_n \in \mathbb{Q}$ for all $n > N$, and so $f \left( x_n \right) = 0$ for all $n > N$. Therefore,    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = 0 = f(p). $$ Now suppose that $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ has infinitely many rational terms and infinitely many irrational terms. Then there are strictly increasing functions $\phi \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ and    $\psi \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that    $$ \phi( \mathbb{N} ) \cap \psi ( \mathbb{N} ) = \emptyset, \qquad  \phi( \mathbb{N} ) \cup \psi ( \mathbb{N} ) = \mathbb{N},  \qquad   x_{\phi(n)} \in \mathbb{Q}, \qquad x_{\psi(n)} \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}.  \tag{1} $$   Then for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have $$ f \left( x_{ \phi(n) }  \right) = 0, \qquad  f \left( x_{ \psi(n) }  \right) = x_{\psi(n)} .$$   So    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty } f \left( x_{ \phi(n) }  \right) = 0, \qquad \lim_{n \to \infty } f \left( x_{ \psi(n) }  \right) = x_{\psi(n)}  = p = 0. \tag{2} $$   Here we have used the fact that, since $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges to $p$, therefore every subsequence of $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ also converges to $p$. Moreover we have taken $p$ to be $0$ here. From (1) and (2) we can conclude that    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = 0 = f(0) = f(p), $$   as required. Thus we have shown that the image sequence $\left( f \left( x_n \right)  \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ of every sequence $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ that converges to $p = 0$ converges to $f(p) = 0$. So $f$ is continuous at $p = 0$. Next, suppose that $p \neq 0$. If $p$ is rational, then $f(p) = 0$. Let $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ be a sequence of irrational numbers converging to $p$. Then    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty } x_n = p \neq 0 = f(p).  $$    On the other hand, if $p$ is irrational, then $f(p) = p \neq  0$. Let    $\left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N} }$ be a sequence of rational numbers converging to $p$. Then    $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f \left( x_n \right) = \lim_{n \to \infty } 0 = 0 \neq p = f(p).  $$    Thus we have shown that $f$ cannot be continuous at any real  $p$ such that $p \neq 0$.

The statement of DCT involves a sequence of functions and the convergence of a sequence of integrals. $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int f_n = \int \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n$$ But when I was dealing with partial derivative of an integral, it's a net of functions which gives the convergence of a net of integrals.

Did I completely miss it? Finally, I am having difficulties with how exactly the proof proves that it is a bijection. I feel that the proof is really hand-wavy and since I am not really familiar with the material this makes it quite difficult to correctly parse the proof, as there are so many details missing. I would be really happy with a reference that has a little more detail.

There are at least two equivalent ways of defining a topology: the standard one involves specifying a family of open sets (which satisfy certain axioms), and a dual way involves specifying a family of closed sets (which satisfy certain axioms). A family of open sets (1) is closed under arbitrary union (2) closed under finite intersections (3) the space itself and the empty set are open, while a family of closed sets is (1) closed under arbitrary intersections (2) closed under finite unions (3) the space itself and the empty set are closed. Any family of open sets determines a family of closed sets and vice-versa via set complementation (because of De Morgan's laws). Question: Corresponding to any topology is a family of open sets and a family of closed sets -- I say that they are ""indistinguishable"" if the family of open sets also satisfies the axioms for a family of closed sets (possibly for a different topology), and if the family of closed sets also satisfies the axioms for a family of open sets (possibly for a different topology). Then for which topologies are the concepts of open sets and closed sets ""indistinguishable"" in the sense mentioned above? Attempt: For any such topological space, both the family of open sets and the family of closed sets are closed under arbitrary unions and arbitrary intersections. If we can get either the family of open sets or the family of closed sets to contain all points, then we automatically have the discrete topology on the space. A topological space is T1 if and only if all points in the space are closed. Thus, if the family of closed sets of such a space also satisfies the open set axioms, then it is actually the entire power set of the space, and by DeMorgan's Laws so is the family of open sets of such a space. Thus the topology is the discrete topology. Thus the only T1 topologies for which the concepts of open and closed sets are indistinguishable in the sense given above are the discrete topologies. I claim that it is also possible to have non-T1 topologies for which the concepts of open and closed sets are indistinguishable as mentioned above and yet the topology is not the discrete topology. Moreover, in some cases of these non-T1 topologies the family of open sets and closed sets are strictly different, even though both families satisfy both the open and closed set axioms. The example in mind I have is extremely simple: consider a space $X$, and a non-empty proper subset $Y$. Then $\{ \emptyset, Y, X \}$ satisfies both the open and closed set axioms, as does $\{ \emptyset, Y^c, X \}$. Obviously these topologies are not T1, even in the case that $X$ consists of only two points.

I would appreciate if someone could point out any flaws. The basic idea is this: If $a$ is a critical point of $f$, then if $x$ is close to $a$, $f'(x)$ is close to $f'(a)=0$, so $f(x)$ varies by a small amount if $x$ stays close to $a$. Our goal is to cover $\mathbb{R}$ by countably many intervals $I_k$ and make the $I_k$ small enough so that if $I_k$ contains a critical point $a$, then $f(I_k)$ will be an interval whose size is small. Then $f(C)$ will be contained in the union of countably many small intervals, which is a rough way of saying $f(C)$ has measure zero. Now more rigorously: Step I: Since a $\mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of intervals of the type $[n,n+1]$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and a countable union of measure-zero sets is measure-zero, it suffices to show that $f(C) \cap [n,n+1]$ is measure-zero for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. It suffices to take the case $n=0$. Step II: Let $S=\{x \in [0,1] : f'(x)=0\}$. Let $a \in S$. Let's fix $\delta>0$ . Since $f'$ is continuous the closed, bounded interval $[0,1]$ it is uniformly continuous on $[0,1]$ by Heine-Cantor, and thus there exists $\epsilon_0>0$ such that $\forall x,y \in [0,1]$, $|x-y|<\epsilon_0 \implies |f'(x)-f'(y)|<\delta$. Hence $\forall x \in [0,1]$, $|x-a|<\epsilon_0 \implies |f'(x)|<\delta$ By Cauchy's mean value theorem, if $\epsilon>0$ then for all $x\neq a$ such that $|x-a|<\epsilon$, there exists $c$ such that $|c-a|<\epsilon$ and $[f(x)-f(a)]/[x-a]=f'(c)$. Choosing $\epsilon<\epsilon_0$, we have $|f'(c)|<\delta$ and thus $|f(x)-f(a)|<\delta|x-a|<\delta\epsilon$. In summary, for all $x \in [0,1]$, for all $\epsilon<\epsilon_0$, we have: $|x-a|<\epsilon \implies |f(x)-f(a)|<\delta\epsilon$. (***) Step III: Now, lets choose $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $1/N<\epsilon_0$. Then since $[0,1]=\bigcup_{0 \le k<N}[\frac{k}{N},\frac{k+1}{N}]$, $f(S)=\bigcup_{0 \le k<N}f(S \cap[\frac{k}{N},\frac{k+1}{N}])$ If $S\cap[\frac{k}{N},\frac{k+1}{N}]=\emptyset$, then its image is empty.
