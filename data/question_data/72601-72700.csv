91,Why does Van Kampen Theorem fail for the Hawaiian earring space?,Why does Van Kampen Theorem fail for the Hawaiian earring space?,,"The Hawaiian earring space has notoriously complicated fundamental group, and is essentially not as simple as the wedge sum of countably many circles whose fundamental group is straightforwardly given by Van Kampen Theorem. However, I'm still struggle to understand why Van Kampen fails in this case. I can, however, largely grasp the topological difference between the two. For instance, the wedge point of countably many unit circles is locally contractible while that of the Hawaiian earring is not. But, when checking the Van Kampen Theorem given by Allen Hatcher, I really can't find anything wrong with the earring: Path-connectedness is trivial. It really suffices to check the red-boxed condition. Of course, for each circle, say $C_n:=\{(x-1/n)^2+y^2=1/n^2\}$ , in the earring space, we can always find an open subarc $L_n$ that deformation retracts onto $(0,0)$ , the wedge point.
