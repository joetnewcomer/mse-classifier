As stated in the book, we want to construct homotopies as follows : There are some facts in the proof of the inductive step that I'm unable to solve.

Let $\phi_\alpha: (E_{\alpha}^n,S_{\alpha}^{n-1})\longmapsto (X,X^{n-1})$ the attaching map of an $n-$ cell (so the image of $\phi_{\alpha}$ lies in $X^{n}$ ), and $f \circ \phi_{\alpha}:(E_{\alpha}^n,S_{\alpha}^{n-1}) \longmapsto (Y,Y^{n-1})\subset  (Y^{n},Y^{n-1})$ . Since $\pi_n(Y,Y^n) = 0$ we have that $f \circ \phi_{\alpha}$ is homotopic (with homotopy costant on $S_{\alpha}^{n-1}$ ) to $g_{\alpha}: (E_{\alpha}^n,S_{\alpha}^{n-1}) \longmapsto (Y^n,Y^{n-1})$ . We can repeat this process for every $n-$ cell and so we have an homotopy $H^n$ between $f_{|_{X^{n}}}$ and a map $X^n \longmapsto Y^n$ . Since $X^n \hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration we can extend the homotopy $H^n$ between $f$ and $\tilde{f} : X \longmapsto Y$ such that $\tilde{f}_{|_{X^{n}}} \subset Y^n$ and $H^n$ costant on $X^{n-1}$ . $\rule{18cm}{1pt}$ Edit $1$ : The points I'd like to clear that I'm unable to solve are the following two : 1 .

The problem here is that I can't compose with $\phi_{\alpha}^{-1}$ ( $\phi_{\alpha}$ is an homeomorphism only of the interior part of $E_\alpha^n$ , so the border of the disk would be ""uncover"") in order to obtain a map from a map from $X^n \times I$ to $Y^n$ which is what I want, since our final goal is to obtain a map homotopic to $f$ restricted to the $n$ -skeleton. I thought that maybe a map like $\begin{cases} H_\alpha \circ (\phi_{\alpha}^{-1}\times id) & x \in \phi_{\alpha}(\text{int}(E_{\alpha}^{n}) \\ f(x)\end{cases}$ could do the job (if continuos), but unfortunately this doesn't seem costant on $X^{n-1}$ , required by $(3)$ .

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $X$ be the closed unit ball $$ \left\{ ( x,  y) \lvert \ x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \ \right\} $$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ , and let $X^*$ be the partition of $X$ consisting of all the one-point sets $\{ (x , y ) \}$ for which $x^2 + y^2 < 1$ , along with the set $S^1 = \left\{ (x , y) \ \vert \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \ \right\}$ . Typical saturated open sets in $X$ are pictured by the shaded regions in Figure 22.4.  One can show that $X^*$ is homeomorphic with the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ called the unit- $2$ -sphere , defined by $$ S^2 = \left\{ \ (x, y, z) \ \vert \ x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 \ \right\}. $$ Now my question is, how is the space $X^*$ homeomorphic with the subspace $S^2$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ ? I'm sorry but I have not been able to make much sense of Figure 22.4 either; so can someone please also elaborate this to me? Here are some relevant definitions. Quotient Map: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $p \colon X \to Y$ be a surjective map. The map $p$ is said to be a quotient map provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ .   .  .  . Saturated Sets: We say that a subset $C$ of $X$ is saturated (with respect to the surjective map $p \colon X \to Y$ ) if $C$ contains every set $p^{-1} \left( \ \{ \ y \ \} \ \right)$ that it intersects.

Similarly, i have at least $2$ natural topologies on $Y\times I$ : the inductive limit topology $(Y\times I)_{\mathrm{lim.ind.}}$ of $$Y_0 \times I \hookrightarrow Y_1\times I \hookrightarrow Y_2\times I \hookrightarrow \cdots \hookrightarrow Y_n\times I \hookrightarrow Y_{n+1}\times I \hookrightarrow \cdots  $$  and the product topology $Y_{\mathrm{ind.lim.}}\times I$ (there is also the product topology $Y_{\mathrm{subspace}}\times I$).

I understand the idea for showing that they are locally contractible, but I don't accept the proof yet, several details are missing in my mind. ((( Basic idea : You take a point and an open neighborhood, and construct, one $n$-skeleton at a time, a growing family of open contractible neighborhoods in said $n$-skeleton : they are obtained by thickening the 'traces' of the previous, lower dimensional neighborhood in the newly attached cells, staying small enough to still fit inside the original neighborhood.))) My problem arises when I want to show that certain homotopies between maps defined on (open) subset of CW complexes are continuous. I know one way of how to show that homotopies of maps defined on quotient spaces are continuous. If $X$ is a topological space and $\mathcal{R}$ an equivalence relation on $X$, then the canonical continuous bijection  $$\frac{X\times I}{\mathcal{R}\times 1}\rightarrow X/\mathcal{R}\times I,~[(x,t)]\mapsto([x],t)$$ is a homeomorphism ($I=[0,1]$, and $\mathcal{R}\times 1$ is the equivalence relation on $X\times I$ such that $(x,t)\sim (x',t')$ iff $x\mathcal{R}x'$ and $t=t'$).

The one I easily found is the definition by 'finite intersection property', but it doesn't quite make the situation simpler. As it is seen in nlab , there is (seemingly) very concise definition of compact space, by compact object in category theory. Directly unwinding the definition, it looks the most complicated: $X$ is compact if and only if the functor $$\mathrm{hom}(X,-)$$ preserves filtered colimits in the category of open sets $\mathrm{Op}(X)$ . If we look closer, since the category $\mathrm{Op}(X)$ is merely a poset, we can translate it as: For any filtered family of open sets $\left\{ X_i\right \}$ , $X\subseteq \bigcup X_i$ if and only if $X \subseteq X_i$ for some $i$ . Which is in turn, a definition of compact object in a poset (if your familiar with it). Again, the notion of 'filteredness' is quite involved. So my aim is to lessen the condition. The definition of 'compact object' simply means that there are no nets of proper open subsets of $X$ that unions to $X$ . I want to make the net merely to be a chain. Here is my reasoning: If a space $X$ has a chain of proper open subsets that unions to $X$ , it's clearly not compact. Conversely, if $X$ is not compact, we have an open cover $\left\{U_i\right\} $ of $X$ not admitting a finite open subcover. (With Axiom of Choice) we can well-order $\left\{U_i\right\}$ and we'll get a sequence of open subsets $\left\{U_\alpha\right\}_{\alpha<\beta}$ . First, just naively construct the increasing sequence $V_\alpha=\bigcup_{\gamma<\alpha} U_\gamma$ , which unions to $X$ . Suppose the sequence stabilizes from the $\beta_0$ th step ( $\beta_0$ can be chosen to be the least one). Then $\beta_0$ should be infinite. If $\beta_0$ is limit, $\left\{V_\alpha\right\}_{\alpha<\beta_0}$ is the desired sequence. Otherwise, $\beta_0=\beta_0'+1$ , and $V_{\beta_0'}$ should be $X$ as $V_\alpha$ is increasing. We now move $U_{\beta_0'}$ to the very first of the sequence $\left\{U_\alpha\right\}$ and still we get a well-ordered sequence. Now, retrying all the process, we get a $\beta_1$ , which is the smallest ordinal $\beta$ among $\bigcup_{\alpha<\beta} U_\alpha=X$ . $\beta_1$ is strictly smaller than $\beta_0$ , since $\bigcup_{\alpha<\beta_0'} U_\alpha = X$ (with the new sequence $\{U_\alpha\}$ .

82,Two (different) infinite-dimensional spheres [closed],Two (different) infinite-dimensional spheres [closed],,"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 1 year ago . Improve this question Let $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ be the set of sequences $x = (x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ with $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ , let $\{e_n\}$ be the standard basis and let $||x||_2 = \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty x_i^2$ . We consider a nice subset, known by many as $\ell^2 = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^\infty : ||x||_2 < \infty \}$ . The norm $||\cdot ||_2$ defines a topology on $\tau_A$ on $\ell^2$ , as well as the unit disk $D_A^\infty = \{ x \in \ell^2 : ||x||_2 \leq 1\}$ and the unit sphere $S_A^\infty = \{ x \in \ell^2 : ||x||_2 = 1\}$ . And so we have obtained the disk and the sphere that make analyst happy. But there is another sect of mathematicians, who define infinite-dimensional spheres in a different way: topologists. Let us consider the ""standard"" sphere $S_B^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^\infty$ , $S^n_B = \{(x_0, \ldots, x_n, 0, 0, \ldots) \text{ such that }\sum\limits_{i=0}^n x_i^2 = 1 \}$ . Let $S_B^\infty = \bigcup\limits_{n=0}^\infty S_B^n$ the union of all finite-dimensional spheres. The disks $D_B^n$ and $D_B^\infty$ are defined in a similar way, substituting $||x||_2 = 1$ with $||x||_2 \leq 1$ . In other words $S_B^\infty$ is the set of all sequences that are eventually null, with norm equal to 1, while $S_A^\infty$ is just the set of all sequences with norm equal to 1. So clearly $S_B^\infty \subset S_A^\infty$ and $D_B^\infty \subset D_A^\infty$ (but they are not equal). But wait, we're talking about sets, what's actually the topology on $S_B^\infty$ ? Following this question , let's use the weak topology, that we will call $\tau_B$ : a set $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^\infty$ is open iff $U \cap \mathbb{R}^n$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for every $n$ . Question 1. What is the relation between $\tau_A$ and $\tau_B$ on $S^\infty_A$ ? (or even better, on the larger set $\ell^2$ ?) I'd say that $\tau_A \subset \tau_B$ because if we intersect an open disk $\mathring{D}(0,r) = \{ x \in \ell^2 : ||x||_2 < r\}$ with a finite-dimensional subspace, we get $\mathring{D}(0,r) \cap \mathbb{R}^n = \mathring{D^n}(0,r)$ . However, $\tau_A \neq \tau_B$ , because the convex hull (=finite linear convex combinations) of the points $\{1 e_1, \frac{1}{2} e_2, \frac{1}{3} e_3, \ldots, \frac{1}{n} e_n, \ldots\}$ is an open set in $\tau_B$ but not in $\tau_A$ . But sadly, I can't gain any further insight on how $\tau_A$ and $\tau_B$ behave on $S_A^\infty$ . Question 2. On the vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^\infty$ , is $\tau_B$ (the weak topology in the sense of intersection with finite-dimensional things) the same as the weak topology (in the sense of duals, i.e. $v_n \rightharpoonup v$ iff for every $f\in V'$ , $f(v_n) \to f(v)$ )? Since the 2-norm is continous on $(\ell^2, \tau_A)$ , then $S_A^\infty$ and $D^\infty_A$ are closed in $(\ell^2, \tau_A)$ .  The closure of $D^\infty_B$ in $(\ell^2, \tau_A)$ is precisely $\overline{D}^\infty_B = D^\infty_A$ , because: It is possible to approximate every sequence $x = (x_0, x_1, \ldots), ||x||_2 \leq 1$ with the truncations $(x_0, \ldots, x_n, 0,0, \ldots) \in D^\infty_B$ Every sequence $\{y^{(n)}\} \in D^\infty_B$ that has limit in $\ell^2$ , must have $||y^{(n)}|| \leq 1$ . With a similar argument, we can see that the closure of $S^\infty_B$ in $(\ell, \tau_A)$ is $S^\infty_A$ , although the truncation of $x \in S^\infty_A$ have to be rescaled to have norm 1, so they are in $S^\infty_B$ . Question 3. Is it true that the closures of $D^\infty_B, S^\infty_B$ in $(\ell^2, \tau_B)$ are $D^\infty_A, S^\infty_A$ ? In general, I would like to understand the differences between the spaces $(S^\infty_B, \tau_B)$ and $(S^\infty_A, \tau_A)$ . For example, by the same first question , we know that both $S^\infty_A$ and $S^\infty_B$ are contractible. One way to do it, is to construct explicitly an homotopy between a generic $x = (x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ and $(1,0,0,\ldots)$ . We do $f_t(x_0, x_1, \ldots) = (1-t)\cdot (x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots) + t \cdot (0, x_0, x_1, \ldots)$ . Then we use $g_t(0, x_0, x_1, \ldots) = (1-t)(0,x_1,x_2,\ldots)+t(1,0,0,\ldots)$ . Combining $f / |f| $ and $g/ |g|$ we get the desired homotopy. Observe that if we start with $x \in S^\infty_B$ , the homotopy has always image in $S^\infty(B)$ . For $S^\infty_B$ , another interesting approach uses algebraic topology: We inductively give a cell structure on $S^n_B$ as the union of $S^{n-1}_B$ and two $n$ -cells (half-spheres). The union of all $S^n_B$ gives a cell structure on $S^\infty_B$ . Observe that the weak topology of cell complexes of $S^\infty_B$ is the same as $\tau_B$ : one is the intersection with cells of size $\leq n$ , the other one with $\mathbb{R}^n$ , which are the same. We have that $H_n(S^\infty_B) = H_n (S^{n+1}_B)$ for the theory of cell complexes. But $H_n(S^{n+1}_B) = 0$ (for example, by putting a friendlier cell structure on $S^{n+1}_B$ , as one $0$ -dimensional and one $n+1$ -dimensional cell; the homology does not depend on cell structure). Therefore $H_n(S^\infty_B)=0$ for all $n>0$ . Using that $S^\infty_B$ is simply-connected, by Hurewicz theorem also $\pi_n(S^\infty_B)=0$ for all $n$ . Then by Whitehead theorem , $S^\infty_B$ is contractible. Wow, this is great! So we can deduce contractibleness from algebraic topology. It's cool, but it is also a bit overkill. Indeed, we could have deduced that $H_n(S^\infty_B)$ and $\pi_n(S^\infty_B)$ are all trivial from contractibility. And since also $S_A^\infty$ is contractible, it must have all trivial homology/homotopy groups. However, maybe it is still interesting to study $S^\infty_A$ topologically? For example: Question 4. It is possible to put a cell structure on $(S^\infty_A, \tau_A)$ ? It is possible to do in a way such that $S^\infty_B$ is a subcomplex of $S^\infty_A$ ?

89,Phase space and collision map of a billiard,Phase space and collision map of a billiard,,"I am working through Ch. 2 of Chaotic billiards by Chernov and Markarian. A few things are puzzling me about the basic construction and definitions. 2.5. Phase space for the flow. The state of a moving particle at any time is specified by its position $q \in \mathcal{D}$ and velocity $v \in S^1$ . Thus the phase is $\Omega = \mathcal{D} \times S^1$ . It then goes on to say that $\Omega$ is a doughnut with cross section of $\mathcal{D}$ . This is intuitive, but what do phase space trajectories look like? Presumably if for every $\mathcal{D}$ we associate a velocity in $S^1$ , then each transversal 'slice' of $\Omega$ will show line segments that are all oriented in the same direction. Is this the correct picture? At each regular boundary point $q$ it is convenient to identify the pairs $(q, v^-)$ and $(q, v^+)$ related by the collision rule $v^+ = v^- - 2\langle v^-, n \rangle n$ ( $v^\pm$ and $n$ are the incoming, outgoing and inward normal vectors at the moment of collision, respectively), which amounts to gluing $\Omega$ along its boundary . What does it mean to glue $\Omega$ along its boundary? I understand that the motivation for doing this is to allow the billiard flow $\Phi^t$ to be smooth. But if that is the case, then my 'picture' of what a phase space trajectory should look like must be wrong: if we collapse $S^1$ into a half circle, making $\Omega$ a half doughnut, nothing really becomes 'smoother' - there are still discrete jumps between one 'slice' of the doughnut and another. Finally, I become really confused when the collision map is introduced. Given a flow $\Phi^t : \Omega \to \Omega$ , one finds a hypersurface $M \in \Omega$ transversal to the flow so that each trajectory crosses $M$ infinitely many times. Won't $M$ be always equal to $\mathcal{D}$ , bar the singular points? Moreover, saying that the flow will pierce $M$ suggests to me that phase space trajectories are actually little curves moving 'through' the doughnut $\Omega$ . It goes on to redefine $\Omega$ as $$\Omega = \{ (x,s) : x \in M, 0 \le s \le L(x) \}$$ where $L(x) = \min \{ s > 0 : \Phi^s(x) \in M\}$ is a return time function and thus the collision map $F : M \to M $ is expressed as $F(x) = \Phi^{L(x)}(x)$ . This new $\Omega$ makes the flow a suspension flow.","I am working through Ch. 2 of Chaotic billiards by Chernov and Markarian.

Thus the phase is . It then goes on to say that is a doughnut with cross section of . This is intuitive, but what do phase space trajectories look like? Presumably if for every we associate a velocity in , then each transversal 'slice' of will show line segments that are all oriented in the same direction. Is this the correct picture? At each regular boundary point it is convenient to identify the pairs and related by the collision rule ( and are the incoming, outgoing and inward normal vectors at the moment of collision, respectively), which amounts to gluing along its boundary . What does it mean to glue along its boundary? I understand that the motivation for doing this is to allow the billiard flow to be smooth. But if that is the case, then my 'picture' of what a phase space trajectory should look like must be wrong: if we collapse into a half circle, making a half doughnut, nothing really becomes 'smoother' - there are still discrete jumps between one 'slice' of the doughnut and another. Finally, I become really confused when the collision map is introduced. Given a flow , one finds a hypersurface transversal to the flow so that each trajectory crosses infinitely many times. Won't be always equal to , bar the singular points? Moreover, saying that the flow will pierce suggests to me that phase space trajectories are actually little curves moving 'through' the doughnut . It goes on to redefine as where is a return time function and thus the collision map is expressed as . This new makes the flow a suspension flow.","q \in \mathcal{D} v \in S^1 \Omega = \mathcal{D} \times S^1 \Omega \mathcal{D} \mathcal{D} S^1 \Omega q (q, v^-) (q, v^+) v^+ = v^- - 2\langle v^-, n \rangle n v^\pm n \Omega \Omega \Phi^t S^1 \Omega \Phi^t : \Omega \to \Omega M \in \Omega M M \mathcal{D} M \Omega \Omega \Omega = \{ (x,s) : x \in M, 0 \le s \le L(x) \} L(x) = \min \{ s > 0 : \Phi^s(x) \in M\} F : M \to M  F(x) = \Phi^{L(x)}(x) \Omega","['general-topology', 'dynamical-systems', 'billiards']"

We can also define a pseudo metric on the set of equivalence classes as follows: given two equivalence classes $[x]$ and $[y]$ , we define $$      d'([x],[y]) = \inf\{d(p_1,q_1)+d(p_2,q_2)+\dotsb+d(p_{n},q_{n})\} $$ where the infimum is taken over all finite sequences $(p_1, p_2,  \dots, p_n)$ and $(q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)$ with $p_1\sim x, q_n\sim y,  q_i\sim p_{i+1}, i=1,2,\dots, n-1$ .
