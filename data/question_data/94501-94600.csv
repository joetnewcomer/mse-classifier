6,"Set of branch points isn't discrete, but branch points are isolated?","Set of branch points isn't discrete, but branch points are isolated?",,"I refer to Chapter II.4 of Rick Miranda - Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces , which I understand says that the branch points of a nonconstant holomorphic map $F: X \to Y$ between Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$ , both of which are not necessarily compact, form a discrete subset of range $Y$ of the map $F$ . (Not sure if 'connected' is part of the definition of Riemann surfaces in other textbooks, but it is here.) Question 1 : Do I understand correctly, and is this indeed true? What else I understand: $A$ is a discrete subspace/subset (I just assume everything here is the usual subspace topology) of $B$ if and only if every singleton subset of $A$ is open in $A$ if and only if every point of $A$ is isolated. This overflow question ( Basic question about branch points on Riemann surfaces ) seems to suggest this is not true but is true if $F$ is proper. However, I'm not sure the definitions of Riemann surface are the same (maybe some answers use definitions where Riemann surfaces are not necessarily connected or something). 2.1. I know $F$ is 'discrete' (meaning that its fibres are discrete; here, i refer to a different text ): see definition before Lemma 3.1, on p. 7), by Proposition II.3.12, and open, by open mapping theorem, which is Proposition II.3.8, but I'm not sure these help show $F$ is proper or are otherwise helpful. Ostensibly 'discrete' maps don't map discrete subsets to discrete subsets. This stackexchange question ( Are branch points always isolated? ) seems to suggest this is true. I think this is true if $F$ is injective or at least something like locally injective. (Please don't make me type up all the stuff I did for this part.) However based on the question in (3) and based on the '3.2. Branch points' on p. 7 in text by Armin Rainer in (2.1) , which I think uses the term 'branch points' to mean the same thing as what Miranda means by 'ramification points' (and thus is different from Miranda's 'branch points'), it seems that no neighbourhood $U$ of a ramification point $p \in U \subseteq X$ of $F$ is such that the restriction $F|_U$ is injective. Kinda related: If $F$ has a ramification point, then is $F$ necessarily not injective? This page ( rigtriv: Hurwitz’s Theorem ) says Now, the ramification and branch points must form a discrete set I don't think the page assumes anything like $F$ is proper. The Armin Rainer text in (2.1) actually seems to assume proper based on the '3.7. Proper holomorphic maps' part, but said part refers to 'Lemma 3.17', so I think proper can be replaced with closed. Maybe $F$ is closed or something. Kinda related (see Question 2 below): When closed and continuous maps discrete to discrete S. K. Donaldson - Riemann Surfaces says If $F$ is proper then the image $\Delta = F(R)$ is discrete in $Y$ . This seems to have all the same assumptions as with Miranda. Ostensibly, either Miranda is wrong or there's some higher level machinery that allows us to omit $F$ proper. Question 2 : To possibly generalise this, what are the minimum requirements on $F, X$ and $Y$ to make $F$ map discrete subsets to discrete subsets? I mean, I'm not sure we really need 'holomorphic' here.

In the book he uses a nice method without involving integration to evaluate $f$ given that the real part of the function is $U$. The method is as follows: The conjugate function $\overline {f(z)}$ has the derivative zero with respect to $z$ and we may therefore consider it as a function of $\overline z$. Call this function $g(\overline z)$.$$u(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}[f(x+iy)+g(x-iy)]$$ If we substitute $x=z/2,y=z/2i$, we obtain$$u(z/2,z/2i)=\frac{1}{2}[f(z)+g(0)]$$ Here in this he assumes he can substitute complex values for $x$ and $y$. So I want to prove that the function $f$ obtained as above is analytic and has the real part as $u(x,y)$. I concluded that since the function $f=2u(z/2,z/2i)+c$ is not a function of $\overline z$, if $u(x,y)$ is rational function then $f $ so derived will be analytic except at poles.  But now I am unable to show that $u(x,y)$ is the real part of the function $f$. If anyone can help in solving this it would be great. Thanks.","I am reading the book Complex Analysis by Lars V Ahlfors. In the book he uses a nice method without involving integration to evaluate $f$ given that the real part of the function is $U$. The method is as follows: The conjugate function $\overline {f(z)}$ has the derivative zero with respect to $z$ and we may therefore consider it as a function of $\overline z$. Call this function $g(\overline z)$.$$u(x,y)=\frac{1}{2}[f(x+iy)+g(x-iy)]$$ If we substitute $x=z/2,y=z/2i$, we obtain$$u(z/2,z/2i)=\frac{1}{2}[f(z)+g(0)]$$ Here in this he assumes he can substitute complex values for $x$ and $y$. So I want to prove that the function $f$ obtained as above is analytic and has the real part as $u(x,y)$. I concluded that since the function $f=2u(z/2,z/2i)+c$ is not a function of $\overline z$, if $u(x,y)$ is rational function then $f $ so derived will be analytic except at poles.  But now I am unable to show that $u(x,y)$ is the real part of the function $f$. If anyone can help in solving this it would be great. Thanks.",,"['complex-analysis', 'proof-verification']"

Thanks.","I'm doing some self-study in complex analysis, and came to the following question: Let $D(a,1) \subset \mathbb{C}$ be the disk of radius $1$ with center at $a \in \mathbb{C}$, and let $\partial D(a,1)$ be the boundary of $D(a,1)$. Prove that $|a| <1$ if and only if there exists a function $f$ analytic on $D(a,1)$ and continuous up to $\partial D(a,1)$ such that $f(z) = 1/\bar{z}$ for $z \in \partial D(a,1)$. I don't know what area of the theory to try to apply here. I know that $|a| <1$ iff   $\; 0 \in D(a,1)$, and I know that the function $1/\bar{z}$ is nowhere analytic. However, I can't see how to get to the desired conclusion. Thanks.",,"['complex-analysis', 'complex-numbers']"

In the way I see the method of construction of a Riemann surface from a function is roughly like below - First one writes the function $f$ as a polynomial of degree $n$ in (say $x$) whose coefficients are rational functions in say $y$. Then from $\mathbb{P}^1$ one removes the points where the coefficients have poles or where the discriminant of the given function is $0$. Then for any $y_0$ in this punctured sphere there exists an open disk around it such that in that disk one can solve the equation to get $n$ function elements of the form $(x_\mu(y_0),y_0)$ (for $\mu =$ 1,2,...,n) such that $f(x_\mu(y_0),y_0)=0$ These analytic elements can be continued on the sphere by monodromy such that their extension depends only on the homotopy class of the loop in the punctured sphere. Its often not clear in the texts whether after doing this one has to - like in finding of the normalization - create symmetric functions of these local function elements which can be globally defined and unambiguous upto crossing a chosen line which has been removed from the sphere and which passes through all the punctures. What is the correspondence here? Now one is supposed to imagine that these $n$ local function elements are denoting the n-sheets of the Riemann surface over this Riemann sphere. And the removed points on the sphere lead to produce the ramification points of the projection map from the Riemann surface to this sphere. Can anyone kindly make the above step precise? One of the many things that confuses me above the above construction is that it seems to say that if I start with a degree $d$ algebaric curve then I will necessarily get the Riemann surface as a $d$ sheeted cover of $P^1$. But that is possibly not the case. How do the number of sheets get reduced in the above construction?

Hence, $|f(z)/g(z)|$ is bounded above by $\max \{2, M\}$ for all z in $\mathbb{C}$. Hence, $h(z)$ is constant by Liouville's Theorem, i.e. $h(z) = f(z)/g(z) = c$ for some constant $c$. Since this is true for all $z$ in $\mathbb{C}$, taking the limit as $z\to \infty$ yields $c = 1$. Hence $f(z) = g(z)$ for all $z$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Is correct my work?",,['complex-analysis']
