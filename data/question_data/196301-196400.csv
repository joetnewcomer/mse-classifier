0,Meaning of Exponential map,Meaning of Exponential map,,"I've been studying differential geometry using Do Carmo's book. There's the notion of exponential map, but I don't understand why it is called ""exponential"" map. How does it has something to do with our common notion of exponentiation? I read from the book The road to reality (by R. Penrose) that it is related to taking exponentiation when making (finite) Lie group elements from Lie algebra elements. It seems like using Taylor's theorem on a manifold so we have, for example, there was the following equation explaining why it is the case. $f(t) = f(0) + f'(0)t + \frac{1}{2!}f''(0) t^2+\cdots = (1+t\frac{d}{dx}+\frac{1}{2!}t^2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\cdots)f(x)|_{x=0} = e^{t\frac{d}{dx}}f(x)|_{x=0}$. The differential operator can be thought of as a vector field on a manifold, and it is how Lie algebra elements (which are vectors, on a group manifold (Lie group), in a tangent space at the identity element). If I understood correctly, the truth is that this is exactly the exponential map that sends a vector on a tangent space into the manifold in such a way that it becomes the end point of a geodesic (determined by the vector) having the same length. Why is the above Taylor expansion valid on a manifold? Why is the exponential map the same as taking exponentiation?","I've been studying differential geometry using Do Carmo's book.

8,Intuition for curvature in Riemannian geometry,Intuition for curvature in Riemannian geometry,,"Studying the various notion of curvature, I have not been able to get the intuition and deeper understanding beyond their definitions. Let me first give the definitions I know. Throughout, I will consider a $m-$dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ equipped with Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$.

12,Is $T^1 S^5$ abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$?,Is  abstractly diffeomorphic to ?,T^1 S^5 S^4\times S^5,"One can ask When is $T^1 S^n$, the unit tangent bundle of $S^n$, abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times S^n$? For even $n$, the answer is never.  This is because $T^1 S^{2n}$ has torsion in its cohomology ring, but $S^{2n-1}\times S^{2n}$ doesn't, so $T^1 S^{2n}$ is not even homotopy equivalent to $S^{2n-1}\times S^{2n}$. For odd $n$, the answer is more delicate. Since $S^1$, $S^3$, and $S^7$ are parallelizable, $T^1 S^1$, the unit tangent bundle to $S^1$, is diffeomoprhic to $S^0\times S^1$.  Likewise, $T^1 S^3$ is diffeomorphic to $S^2\times S^3$.  The same argument shows $T^1 S^7$ is diffeomorphic to $ S^6\times S^7$.  In all of these cases, a much stronger statement is true:  $T^1 S^{k}\cong S^{k-1}\times S^k$ as bundles over $S^k$ (for $k=1,3,7$.) So, the first case where I don't know the answer is $T^1 S^5$.  The first thing to say is that $S^5$ is not parallelizable, so $T^1 S^5$ is not bundle isomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$.

So none of the ""usual"" invariants distinguish them.  (More generally, I think I can prove that $T^1 S^{2n-1}$ and $S^{2n-2}\times S^{2n-1}$ have isomorphic cohomology rings and the same characteristic classes). On the other hand, a paper by De Sapio and Walschap, ""Diffeomorphism of total space and equivalence of bundles"" proves that $TS^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n\times S^n$ are not abstractly diffeomorphic, unless they are also bundle isomorphic.  So, we know that $TS^5$ is not diffeomoprhic to $\mathbb{R}^5\times S^5$.  So, if $T^1 S^5$ and $S^4\times S^5$ are diffeomorphic, then no diffeomorphism can extend to a diffeomorphism of $TS^5$ and $\mathbb{R}^5\times S^5$. I'm not sure how hard the answer for $S^5$ will compared to any other $S^{k}$ with $k$ odd $\neq 1,3,7$, so I'll ask the $S^5$ question separately: Is $T^1 S^5$ abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^4\times S^5$?","One can ask When is $T^1 S^n$, the unit tangent bundle of $S^n$, abstractly diffeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times S^n$?

17,Characterization of the exterior derivative $d$,Characterization of the exterior derivative,d,"In the paper Natural Operations on Differential Forms , the author R.

I've tried to read the proof in the paper, but I'm struggling to follow the details and missing a sense of the big picture of the proof. I'm interested in Palais' claim because this characterization is the most compelling one I have seen $-$ it seems far more appropriate as an axiomatic definition of $d$ than the definitions found in many textbooks, which often define $d$ based on properties such as $d(\alpha \wedge \beta) = d\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^k \alpha \wedge d\beta$ (where $\alpha$ is a $k$-form), $d^2=0$, or $d(\sum \omega_{i_1...i_k}dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}) = \sum d\omega_{i_1...i_k} \wedge dx_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge dx_{i_k}$.

That is, suppose we have an $n$-manifold $M$ together with a smooth function $f$ with exactly two critical points (both non-degenerate), then $M$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. I understand the most crucial part. That is, let $f$ be normalized such that the critical points are mapped to $0$ and $1$ respectively. We can then prove that $f^{-1}[0,a]$ is diffeomorphic to $f^{-1}[0,b]$ for any $0<a,b<1$ by constructing a certain vector field out of the gradient of $f$ and then using the flow of this vector field as the required diffeomorphism. Then if $f^{-1}[0,\epsilon]$ and $f^{-1}[1-\epsilon,1]$ are homeomorphic to a disk, we have that $M$ must be the union of two disks glued along their boundary, making $M$ homeomorphic to $S^n$. Now my problem is the part where there is an $\epsilon>0$ such that $f^{-1}[0,\epsilon]$ is homeomorphic to an ($n$-dimensional) disk. Milnor uses a lemma (Morse Lemma) which constructs quadratic coordinates in some open neigborhood of $f^{-1}(0)$, but this seems to far too strong. So I was wondering if it's possible to prove this without resorting to that lemma. My idea is first of all to note that $f^{-1}[0,\epsilon]$ is contractible since we can simply consider the family $f^{-1}[0,t]$ for $t\in[0,\epsilon]$. So if we shrink $f^{-1}[0,\epsilon]$ such that it fits inside a single chart, we can consider it as an closed contractible subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. However this is not enough to make it homeomorphic to a disk. Another approach would be to prove that $f^{-1}[\epsilon,a]$ is homeomorphic to $S^{n-1}\times [0,1]$, and then argue that since for any $0<t<\epsilon$, $f^{-1}[t,a]$is a deformation retract of $f^{-1}[\epsilon,a]$, so $f^{-1}[0,a]$ would be homeomorphic to $S^n\times [0,1]$ with $S^n\times\{0\}$ identified to a point. This space is then homeomorphic to a disk as well. Milnor also remarks that the non-degeneracy condition on $f$ is not essential. The way I would like to prove it doesn't use non-degeneracy either.

He uses a lemma by Brown and Stalling that says that for a paracompact manifold $M$, if any compact subset is contained in an open set diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $M$ is itself diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $x_0$, $x_1$ be the critical points, and let $U$ be a neigborhood of $x_0$ diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then using the gradient we can always stretch $U$ such that it covers any compact subset of $M-x_1$. Hence $M-x_1$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.

This should be an intuitive and general definition of what a moduli space is. Now, in the contest of algebraic geometry, we refer to a moduli space as a scheme that (co)represents a particular functor, i.e. \begin{equation} \mathcal{M}:\,\{\mathfrak{schemes}\}^{\circ}\longrightarrow\{\mathfrak{sets}\} \end{equation} that is called the $moduli \,functor$. The question if it is (co)representable is called the $moduli \;problem$. My question is, how does a differential geometer image a moduli space? That is, I thought that he thinks it in the same above way (replacing the category of schemes with a more suitable category), but it turns out that it is not so. thank you! EDIT: I have seen some people still look at this post, so maybe it is worth to add something. First of all,  the geometry of a $C^{\infty}$-manifold is much less rigid than that one of an algebraic variety. This reflects, for example, on the fact that in general we can find a lot automorphisms of the objects we are interested in. In particular, most of the cases (and probably 'all' the cases) we have no hope to get a fine moduli space: this justify the fact that, in differential geometry, one usually talks about moduli space without specify if it is fine or not. Secondly, regarding my description of the moduli problem. I have recently looked at the theory of $C^{\infty}$-schemes (see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4951v2.pdf ). This is a generalization of the concept of a $C^{\infty}$-manifold in the same way as a scheme is a generalization of an algebraic variety. An interesting aspect of this theory is, for example, that a $C^{\infty}$-manifold is always an affine $C^{\infty}$-scheme. Replacing the category of $C^{\infty}$-schemes in the moduli functor defined above, we can think at a moduli space of $C^{\infty}$-objects in the classical algebraic way. Moreover, this leads in a natural way to a theory of derived differential geometry. Finally, I feel quite confident with this. Neverthless, this theory is modelled on the algebraic analogue and it is very recent. Even if my interests are principally on algebraic geometry, I had asked this question because I was wondering how mathematicians from different areas of mathematics approach to the problem of studying moduli spaces (the basic aim was to better understand the mathematical feeling behind these objects). And since moduli spaces in differential geometry were studied before (or at least without) the theory of $C^{\infty}$-schemes, my primary question is still not anwered.","A moduli space is a set that parametrizes objects with a fixed property and that is endowed with a particular structure.

81,The heat kernel as a distance metric on manifolds,The heat kernel as a distance metric on manifolds,,"I recently came across Varadhan's formula (see e.g. [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] ): $$ {d_{\text{g}}(x,y)^2}{} = -\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} 4 t \log K_t(x,y) $$ where $d_\text{g}$ is the geodesic distance and $K_t$ is the heat kernel (i.e. the fundamental solution to the manifold heat equation $\Delta_g u = \partial_t u$). Essentially, it gives a way to compute the geodesic distance between two points, using the heat kernel. Completely separately, there is a notion of a diffusion map (see e.g. [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] ). The idea is to use a ""similarity"" function $\kappa(x,y)$ to construct the transition matrix of a Markov process representing a random walk on a set of points (from a manifold): $$ p(x,y) = \dfrac{\kappa(x,y)}{\sqrt{\left(\sum_u\kappa(x,u)\right)\left(\sum_v\kappa(y,v)\right)}} $$ which is the chance of the walk moving from $x$ to $y$ in one step. The chance of moving from $x$ to $y$ in $n$ steps is given by the matrix power $p_n(x,y)=p^{(n)}(x,y)$. The diffusion distance is then: $$ d_m(x,y)^2 = \sum_{z} || p_m(x,z) - p_m(y,z) ||^2_d $$ where $m$ is fixed and $||\cdot||_d$ is some distance metric. Informally, the diffusion distance is related to the length of all paths between the two points . This is quite distinct from the geodesic distance. Of course, the quantity $K_t(x,y)$ is akin to a similarity function (since it is the probability of getting from $x$ to $y$ in time $t$ for a random walk), and could also be used to construct a notion of distance directly, I suppose.
