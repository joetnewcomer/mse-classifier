Nevertheless, I can imagine an instructor asking a student to 'rotate the triangle so that it exactly overlaps the other one, record the angle of rotation, dilate it by a factor of x , and then sketch the result. In this case, the instructor seems to talk about the plane as though it includes two identical triangles, even after the rotation; it also seems that the correct sketch would include two triangles, one inside the other. Can a plane include two indiscernible triangles?",,"['geometry', 'terminology']"
