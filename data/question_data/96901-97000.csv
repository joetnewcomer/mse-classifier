0,Finding the singularity type at $z=0$ of $\frac{1}{\cos(\frac{1}{z})}$,Finding the singularity type at  of,z=0 \frac{1}{\cos(\frac{1}{z})},"I have the following homework problem: What kind of singular point does the function   $\frac{1}{\cos(\frac{1}{z})}$ have at $z=0$ ? What I tried: We note (visually) that $z_{0}$ is the same type of singularity for both $f,f^{2}$ hence the type of singularity of $f(z)=\frac{1}{\cos(\frac{1}{z})}$ have at $z=0$ is the same type of singularity $f^{2}(z)=\frac{1}{\cos^{2}(\frac{1}{z})}$. We recall  $$ \frac{1}{\cos^{2}(z)}=1+\tan^{2}(z) $$ We also note that for any constant $z_{0}\in\mathbb{C}$ the singularity of $f,f+z_{0}$ are the same, this can be proved by noting the Laurent expansions of both functions are the same, up to an additive constant. It remains to determine the singularity type at the origin of  $$ \tan(\frac{1}{z}) $$ This is where I'm stuck, we didn't study what the Taylor series of $\tan(z)$.

(3 answers) Closed 6 years ago . Let $U: \mathbb C \to \mathbb R$ be a harmonic function such that $U(z)\ge 0 \ \forall z\in \mathbb C$ ; then $U$ is constant. Let $u:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a harmonic function such that $0\leq f(z)$ for all $ z \in \mathbb{C}$. Prove that $u$ is constant. I don't know about simply connected domain. Can we do it without using that? Edit: The more elementary the proof, the better. I'm working my way through a complex analysis workbook, and by this exercise, the substantial things covered are Lioville's theorem, Maximum modulus theorem.",,"['complex-analysis', 'harmonic-functions']"

43,Why can we extend the zeta function from $\{\Re(s) > 1\} $ to $\{\Re(s) > 0\} $?,Why can we extend the zeta function from  to ?,\{\Re(s) > 1\}  \{\Re(s) > 0\} ,"First off, let me start by saying that I have not studied complex analysis nor number theory yet, so I may be too eager in my pursuits to study $\zeta(s) $. But I am a quick study, and have found the function mesmerizing since I first saw it's relation to primes in high school. Why can we extend the zeta function from $\{\Re(s) > 1\} $ to $\{\Re(s) > 0\} $? As a friendly reminder, $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac1{n^s}$$ which converges for $\Re(s) > 1$ by the integral test, and diverges for all other values. By multiplying through by $(1-2^{1-s}) $ (and later dividing by it), we arrive at an alternate identity: $$\zeta(s) = \frac1{1-2^{1-s}}\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^s}$$ By the alternating series test, this converges for $\Re(s) > 0$ with $\Re(s) \ne 1$. In this way, we've extended the domain, however, it seems contradictory to me, as the former definition implies divergence for $0 <\Re(s) <1$, and the later implies convergence in this region. My thoughts were that the integral test perhaps does not apply the same way for $s \in \mathbb{C} $ as it did for $s \in \mathbb{R} $, but I don't see off-hand why this same dichotomy wouldn't happen if $s \in \mathbb{R}$, as the derivation didn't seem to rely on complex numbers.

Since $te^{-t}$ is univalent in $|t|=1$ there is only one such $t$ for a given $a$ and $e^t$ is the only possible limit for $W_n$ .  By Theorem 2, $e^t$ belongs to a component $D$ of $\mathscr{C}(T)$ which contains the only singular point of $T^{-1}$ , namely the origin.

Theorem 3 : For any integer $p > 1, \mathscr{F}(f) = \mathscr{F}(f^p)$ The proof of Theorem 2 relies on being able to study the iteration of $F = f^p$ instead of $f$ itself, since by Theorem 3 $\mathscr{F}(F) = \mathscr{F}(f)$ . Theorem 4 : $\mathscr{C}(f)$ and $\mathscr{F}(f)$ are completely invariant under $f$ in the sense that if $z\in \mathscr{C}(f)$ then $f(z)\in \mathscr{C}(f)$ , and if further $f(w) = z$ then $w \in \mathscr{C}(f)$ To be clear, I am asking for the proofs of Theorems 3 and 4.
