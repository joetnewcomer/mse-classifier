EDIT : As mentioned by Will Orrick in the comments, the inductive approach works too, just prove the stronger claim that $$  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n}{2k}3^k, \quad  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k}3^k, \quad  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}3^k, \quad  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n}{2k+1}3^k \quad $$ are all divisible by $2^n$. If $n = 1$ we get $4$, $10$, $6$ and $2$ and if $n > 1$ we have \begin{align*}  & \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n}{2k}3^k \\  & = 3 \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2(k-1)+1} 3^{k-1}      + \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k} 3^k \\  & = 3 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k+1} 3^k +         \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k} 3^k \\  & = 3 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k + 3 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k+1} 3^k     + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k-1} 3^k + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k \\  & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k + 3 \sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k+1} 3^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k-1} 3^k \\ & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k-1} 3^k + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k-1} 3^k \\ & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k + 6\sum_{k=0}^{n-2} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k+1} 3^k \\ & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k + 6\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k+1} 3^k   \end{align*} and now by assumption both sums are divisible by $2^{n-1}$, and as they are multiplied with even numbers their sum is divisible by $2^n$. Similar \begin{align*}  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k}3^k  & = \sum_{k=0}^n \left( \binom{2n-1}{2k-2} + \binom{2n-1}{2k-1} + \binom{2n-1}{2k-1} + \binom{2n-1}{2k } \right) 3^k \\  & = \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{2n-1}{2k-2} 3^k + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2n-1}{2k} 3^k + 2\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{2n-1}{2k-1} 3^k \\  & = 3 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2n-1}{2k} 3^k + \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2n-1}{2k} 3^k + 2\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{2n-1}{2k-1} 3^k \\ & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2n-1}{2k} 3^k +  2\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{2n-1}{2k-1} 3^k \\ & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k} 3^k +  6\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k+1} 3^k \\ \end{align*} and for the other sums we have \begin{align*}  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}3^k  & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k+1} 3^k +  2\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n-1}{2k} 3^k\\  & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k+1} 3^k +  2\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)+1}{2k} 3^k\\  \sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{2n}{2k+1}3^k  & = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k+1} 3^k +  2\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1)}{2k} 3^k \end{align*} and the induction hypothesis gives the result.",,"['combinatorics', 'number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'summation', 'binomial-coefficients']"

84,recurrence involving permutations,recurrence involving permutations,,"Let $K_n$ be the number of permutations $\pi$ of $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ so that $|i-j|=1$ implies $|\pi(i)-\pi(j)| \leq 2$ for all $i,j$ in $\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ . Show that for $n\ge 2, K_{n+5} - K_{n+4} - K_{n+3} + K_n = 4.$ I know recurrence relations that can be used to derive the answer. However, I don't understand how those recurrences were obtained, so could someone elaborate or provide a proof on that? Below are the recurrences I'm confused about. Let $A_n$ be the number of permutations $\pi$ of $K_{n+1}$ with $\pi(1) = 1$ , where $K_1 := 1$ . Then $K_n = 2(A_0+A_1+\cdots + A_{n-3}+A_{n-1})\,\forall n\ge 2$ and $A_n = A_{n-1}+A_{n-3} + 1$ for $n\ge 3$ . Also, one has the following recurrences: Assume $n\ge 3$ . Let $U_n$ be the number of permutations counted by $K_n$ that end with $n-1,n$ , let $V_n$ be the number ending in $n,n-1$ , let $W_n$ be the number starting with $n-1$ and ending in $n-2,n$ , let $T_n$ be the number ending in $n-2,n$ but not starting with $n-1$ , and let $S_n$ be the number that has $n-1,n$ consecutively in that order but not at the beginning or end of a permutation. (Why is it true that) every permutation $\pi$ counted by $K_n$ either lies in exactly one of the sets counted by $U_n, V_n, W_n, T_n, S_n$ or is the reverse of such a permutation. Thus $P_n = 2(U_n + V_n + W_n+ T_n+S_n)$ . Also one has the recurrence relations $U_{n+1} = U_n + W_n + T_n, V_{n+1 } = U_n, W_{n+1} = W_n, T_{n+1} = V_n, S_{n+1} = S_n + V_n$ . I get that $W_n = 1$ for all $n$ ; $n-1$ must be beside $n-3$ , $n-2$ must follow $n-4,$ etc. So a permutation in $W_n$ would have to be of the form $(n-1,n-3,n-5,\cdots, n-4, n-2,n)$ . If $n$ is odd, in the middle of the permutation is $2,1$ and if n is even there is $1,2$ . Clearly every permutation counted by $U_n, W_n, V_n, S_n, T_n$ lies in the set of permutations counted by $K_n$ . Now suppose $\pi$ is a permutation counted by $K_n$ that does not lie in $U_n, W_n, V_n, S_n, $ or $T_n$ and is not the reverse of a permutation lying in $U_n, W_n, V_n, S_n, $ or $T_n$ . $n$ must be paired with $n-1$ or $n-2$ in any permutation counted by $K_n$ . We cannot have $\pi(n) = n$ or $\pi(1) = n$ (otherwise $\pi$ is counted by $U_n, W_n$ or $T_n$ or is the reverse of a permutation counted by $U_n, W_n,T_n$ ). So $\pi(i)=n$ for some $2\leq i\leq n-1$ . By the above observation, either $\pi(i-1) = n-1$ or $\pi(i-1) = n-2$ . If it's the former then $\pi$ is counted by $S_n$ or is the reverse of a permutation counted by $V_n$ and if it's the latter then it's either counted by $V_n$ or is the reverse of a permutation counted by $S_n$ . This covers all possibilities, so we are done the proof of this claim. So to summarize, this question asks to justify/prove the recurrences for $K_n$ (just the first one if the proof above is right; permutations in the sets of permutations counted by $U_n, V_n, W_n, S_n, T_n$ are in bijection with their reverses), the recurrence for $A_n$ and the recurrences for $U_n, W_n, V_n, S_n, T_n$ . As an example to clarify the sets $U_n, V_n, W_n, T_n, S_n$ for $n=3$ , we have $U_n = \{(1,2,3)\}, V_n=\{(1,3,2)\}, W_n=\{(2,1,3)\}, T_n=\emptyset, S_n=\emptyset$ .","Let be the number of permutations of so that implies for all in .

For background, I am starting with a known result, and will articulate the conjecture based on it (the picture gives an example for the conjecture). Definition: Given an $n\times n$ grid, where exactly 1 diagonal is randomly placed in each unit square. Existence Lemma: Going along the diagonals, there is always a path crossing the grid from one side to the opposite side (top-down or left-right). There are several proofs of this lemma. One goes by exploration; one uses a separation theorem from topological dimension theory; one is based on a dual graph approach. They are presented in the original post ( https://mathoverflow.net/q/112067/156936 ). There is another proof making iterated use of the Lemma of Sperner ( https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3677664/782412 ). Definition to cover a special case just to keep the formulation of the conjecture simple: (1) The top left corner of the grid is defined to belong to the top side and to the left side, and similarly for the other three corners of the grid. (2) In light of this corner definition, a path going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner is seen as two paths , i.e. one from top to bottom and one from left to right. Similarly for a path crossing from top right corner to bottom left corner. Conjecture: For $n>1$ , there are at least two paths along the diagonals crossing the grid. Remark: Using the picture above to illustrate the definition of what counts as different paths: Clearly, the paths A-B, A-C, B-C and x-y are no crossing paths, as they don't cross the grid from one side to the opposite side. For the same reason, A-y is not a crossing path. The paths A-x, B-y, and C-y count as three different paths that are crossing the grid. Finally, B-x also counts as a crossing path because it contains A-x, and A-x is a crossing path. (This is consistent with the definition of the special case connecting opposite corners.) In summary, the picture is an example with 4 crossing paths A-x, B-x, B-y, C-y. More generally, two paths can have common diagonals. If we have a crossing path that branches in two paths right before the grid border, it counts as two paths. Two paths can both cross in the same direction, for example left to right crossing for both paths. Question This conjecture is based on samples for $n<10$ .

90,Understanding the combinatorial argument for $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = 3 \binom{n+1}{4}$.,Understanding the combinatorial argument for .,\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = 3 \binom{n+1}{4},"I was playing around the expression for $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$, and I discovered that it equals $3\binom{n+1}{4}$. I couldn't come up with any combinatorial argument, but found various ones on this site. I'm trying to understand a particular one. In this comment , the user r9m gives the following combinatorial argument: A direct combinatorial interpretation of the factor $3$ can be obtained by counting number of parallelograms in a equilateral triangle with side length $(n−1)$ and tiled with $(n−1)^2$ equilateral triangles with side length $1$(like this ). Of course one way of counting is $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$. The other way is divide the parallelograms into $3$ cases (each parallelogram must have its diagonal parallel to one of the $3$ sides of the equilateral triangle) which is $3 \times \binom{n+1}{4}$. I'm having trouble understanding both parts of this argument. In particular, I cannot think of the things to choose from for both binomial coefficients. For the first half, what are the $\binom{n}{2}$ things, from which we need to choose $2$? I suspect that since a parallelogram is uniquely defined in this grid by its longer diagonal, they are the endpoints of the diagonal of a parallelogram. But there are some restrictions for choosing the endpoints of a diagonal: e.g. the line joining them cannot be parallel to any of the sides of the equilateral triangle. For the second half, I understand the factor of $3$, and counting parallelograms with their shorter diagonal parallel of a particular side. However, I cannot see a ""thing"" that exists $n+1$ times in this figure. I suspect $4$ is the number of vertices of a parallelogram, but what is $n+1$?","I was playing around the expression for $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$, and I discovered that it equals $3\binom{n+1}{4}$.
