1,Why is the hypergame not simply well founded?,Why is the hypergame not simply well founded?,,"According to Cameron, the hypergame paradox proceeds as follows: A game is considered as well founded if ANY play of the game ends in a finite number of moves. A hypergame is where the first player chooses well founded a game, and then the second player begins that game (the game is played with the roles reversed). Is the hypergame wf? It should be, because the first player has to choose a wf game, and so it must end in a finite number of moves. But then, as it is well founded, the second player can choose the hypergame, and then the players can choose the hypergame ad infinitum, contradicting the hypergames wf-ness. I do not see how this contradicts the hypergames wf-ness. The definition of a hypergame clearly sttaes that ANY play of the game ends in a finite number of moves. Well, the hypergame begins on the first go, and then if the second player chose tic-tac-toe (or any wf game except the hypergame), the game would be over in a finite number of moves in this case, making it well founded. Surely one case of the hypergame not ending in a finite number of moves does not contradict its wf-ness.

36,Proving that Zorn's Lemma implies the axiom of choice,Proving that Zorn's Lemma implies the axiom of choice,,"I am trying to solve an exercise, in which we were asked to prove that Zorn's lemma implies axiom of choice. I am using a guidance that was given that said we should use a set $\mathcal{F}$ which i'll define throughout the proof: Proof: Given a set of nonempty sets $F$ , define the set $\mathcal{F}$ to be: $\mathcal{F}=\{f \mid f \space is \space a \space choice \space function \space on \space a \space subset \space of \space F\}$ . ( $\mathcal{F}$ is not empty since on subsets of $F$ , that contain only one set, one can easily define a choice function). Define a relation $\leq$ on $\mathcal{F}$ in the following way: given $f_1,f_2\in\mathcal{F}$ which are choice functions on $\mathcal{A_1},\mathcal{A_2} \subseteq F$ , we say that $f_1 \leq f_2$ if $\mathcal{A_1} \subseteq \mathcal{A_2}$ and $f_2|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ . We will show that: $\langle\mathcal F,\leq\rangle\\$ is a partially order relation. Every chain in $\langle \mathcal{F},\leq \rangle$ , has an upper bound in $\mathcal{F}$ , and therefor, by Zorn's lemma, $\langle\mathcal{F},\leq \rangle$ has a maximal element. This maximal element is a choice function on $F$ . Proof of 1: reflexivity: $(f_1,f_1) \in \leq$ , since, of course, $f_1|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ antisymmetry: given $f_1 \leq f_2$ and $f_2 \leq f_1$ , we get that $\mathcal{A_1}=\mathcal{A_2}$ , and $f_1|_{\mathcal{A_2}}=f_2$ and $f_2|_{\mathcal{A_1}}=f_1$ which implies $f_1=f_2$ . in a similar (rather obvious) way the transitivity can be proved. Proof of 2: given a chain $f_1 \leq f_2 \leq ...$ take $f:\bigcup \mathcal{A_i} \rightarrow \bigcup f_i$ to be the function s.t. $f|_{\mathcal{A_i}} = f_i$ , for every $i$ . Then $f$ is an upper bound for the chain, and $f \in \mathcal{F}$ . Proof of 3: Take $g$ , to be the maximal element from 2. we have to show that $g$ is a choice function on all sets in $F$ , and that it is well defined. choice function on all $F$ : suppose not, there exists a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ s.t. $g$ , is not defined on $A$ . $A$ is not empty, so, take some $a \in A$ and define $h$ to be: $h(X)=\begin{cases} a,&\text{if } X=A\\ g(X),&\text{if } X \neq A \end{cases}$ Then $g < h$ contradicting the fact that $g$ is maximal. $g$ is well defined : Suppose not, there exists an $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $a_1,a_2 \in A$ where $a_1 \neq a_2$ , such that $g(A)=a_1$ and $g(A)=a_2$ . but then, from the construction of $g$ , there exists an $f_i$ with domain $\mathcal{A_i}$ , which is not well defined, which is also a contradiction.

Further, a lower bound in this case is an element $\gamma'$ such that for all $\zeta'\in kS$ we have that $\gamma'\leq \zeta'$. Comment: Please let me know if I have the foundational ideas here down, so I can begin working on this. I want to get it solid. Edit: So it turns out that this problem was pushed to the next homework set, so I get to keep working on it. So far this is what I've got: Consider the case where $k=0$. This means $kS=0S=\{0\}$, and so we have that $$\sup(kS)=\sup\{0\}=0=0\sup(S)=k\sup(S).$$ Now consider the case where $k>0$. Note that $\sup(kS)$ is the element in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\hspace{0.25cm}$(a) $\sup(kS)$ is an upper bound for $kS$, and $\hspace{0.25cm}$(b) if $\alpha$ is any upper bound for $kS$, then $\sup(kS)\leq \alpha$, so if is sufficient to show that $k\sup(S)$ is the element in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\hspace{0.25cm}$(a') $k\sup(S)$ is an upper bound for $kS$, and $\hspace{0.25cm}$(b') if $\alpha$ is any upper bound for $kS$, then $k\sup(S)\leq \alpha$, namely that properties (a) and (b) hold for $\sup(kS)=k\sup(S)$. Thus, if $k\sup(S)$ is an upper bound for $kS$, then there is an $s\in S$ such that $\beta=ks$, where $\beta\in kS$. This would mean $s\leq \sup (S)$ because $\sup(S)$ is an upper bound for $S$, which means $\beta=ks\leq k\sup(S)$, and so $k\sup(S)$ is an upper bound for $kS$, as $\beta$ was arbitrary. Now in order to show that if $\alpha$ is any upper bound for $kS$, then $k\sup(S)\leq \alpha$, first suppose that $\alpha$ is an upper bound for $kS$. If this were the case, then $ks\leq \alpha$ for all $s\in S$, and so $s\leq\frac{\alpha}{k}$ for all $s\in S$, which therefore means that $\frac{\alpha}{k}$ is an upper bound for $S$; hence $\sup(S)\leq\frac{\alpha}{k}$. Multiplication by $k$ on both side of this inequality gives us that $k\sup(S)\leq \alpha$; quod erat demonstrandum . Similarly, to show $\inf(kS)=k\inf(S)$ there are two case to consider, namely $k=0$, and $k>0$. If $k=0$, then $kS=0S=\{0\}$, and so we have that $$\inf(kS)=\inf\{0\}=0=0\inf(S)=k\inf(S).$$ Suppose now that $k>0$. In this case, just as above, is is sufficient to show that $\hspace{0.25cm}$(a) $k\inf(S)$ is a lower bound for $kS$, and $\hspace{0.25cm}$(b) if $\alpha$ is any lower bound for $kS$, then $\alpha\leq k\inf(S)$. Thus if $k\inf(S)$ is a lower bound for $kS$, then there is an $s\in S$ such that $\beta=ks$, where $\beta\in kS$. Therefore $s\geq\inf(S)$ because $\inf(S)$ is a lower bound for $S$, and so $\beta=ks\leq k\inf(S)$, which means $k\inf(S)$ is a lower bound for $kS$ since $\beta$ was arbitrary. Now to show (b), suppose that $\alpha$ is a lower bound for $kS$. In this case we have that $ks\leq\alpha$ for all $s\in S$, and so $s\leq\frac{\alpha}{k}$ for all $s\in S$; hence $\frac{\alpha}{k} $ is a lower bound for $S$, and so we have that $\inf(S)\leq\frac{\alpha}{k}$.

(IC) For any two sets $X,Y$ either there is an injection $X \hookrightarrow Y$ or $Y \hookrightarrow X$. (SC) For any two sets $X,Y$ either there is an surjection $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ or $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$. (WO) $\rightarrow$ (IC): Let $X,Y$ be two sets. Then by (WO) they can be well-ordered. Therefore each is in bijection with an ordinal $\alpha$ (and $\beta$, respectively): Claim: Every well-ordered set is isomorphic to an ordinal. Proof: Let $\langle, X,W \rangle$ be a well-ordered set. Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal with $|\alpha| \ge |X|$. Define an injective map $f: X \hookrightarrow \alpha$ as follows: (i) Let $x_0$ be the $W$-minimal element. Then $x_0 \mapsto \varnothing$. (ii) Assume $f$ has been defined for $x \in I_W (x')$. Define $x' \mapsto \sup^+ f(I_W (x'))$. Let $\tilde{f} = f: X \to \mathrm{im}f$. Then $\tilde{f}$ is a bijection and $\mathrm{im}f$ is an initial segment of an ordinal hence also an ordinal.$\Box$ Either $\alpha \in \beta$ or $\beta \in \alpha$.

72,Prove that union of disjoint finite sets is finite,Prove that union of disjoint finite sets is finite,,"Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint sets which are finite. I am proving that $A\cup B$ is also finite. If either $A$ or $B$ is an empty set $\varnothing$ , then $A \cup B$ is either $A$ or $B$ . And so $A\cup B$ is a finite set. So, we will assume that $A \ne \varnothing$ and $B \ne \varnothing$ . Since $A$ and $B$ are finite sets, there are bijections $f : A \to I_m$ and $g : B \to I_n$ . Where, $I_m = \{ i \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \, |\, i \leq m \} $ and $I_n = \{ i \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \, | \,i \leq n \} $ . Now, I need to prove that $A\cup B$ is also finite. So, I need to come up a bijection from $A\cup B$ to $I_{m+n}$ . Now, consider the following binary relation $h$ from $A\cup B$ to $I_{m+n}$ . $$  (x, f(x)) \in h  \, \text{ if } x \in A \\     (x, m + g(x)) \in h \, \text{ if } x \in B $$ Now, I will prove that this is a function. Let $x \in A \cup B$ be arbitrary. Since they are disjoint, this means that we have two cases. If $x \in A$ , we have some $1 \leqslant k_1 \leqslant m$ in $I_m$ such that $f(x) = k_1$ . And , if $x \in B$ , we have some $1 \leqslant k_2 \leqslant n$ in $I_n$ such that $g(x) = k_2$ . So, $m + g(x) = m + k_2$ . Now, we have $ k_1 \in I_{m+n}$ and $m + k_2 \in I_{m+n}$ . So, it follows that if $x \in A$ , then $(x , k_1) \in h$ and if $x \in B$ , then $m + k_2 \in h$ . So, we proved the existence of some element $y$ in $I_{m+n}$ such that $(x,y) \in h$ . Now, suppose there are two such elements $y_1$ and $y_2$ . So, we have $(x,y_1) \in h$ and $(x,y_2) \in h$ . Now, here if $x \in A$ , then $y_1 = f(x)$ and $y_2 = f(x)$ . It follows that $y_1 = y_2$ . If, $x \in B$ , then $y_1 = m + g(x)$ and $y_2 = m + g(x)$ . Again, it follows that $y_1 = y_2$ . So, now we proved the uniqueness. So, this proves that $h$ is a function. So, we have $$ h: A\cup B \to I_{m+n} $$ $$ h(x) =  \begin{cases}  f(x)  & \text{if $x \in A$} \\ m + g(x) & \text{if $x \in B$}  \end{cases} $$ Now, the task is to prove that this function is a bijection. Consider $h(x_1) = h(x_2)$ . Now, there are three cases to consider. Case 1) $x_1, x_2 \in A$ In this case, we have $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ and since $f$ is a bijection, we have $x_1 = x_2$ . Case 2) $x_1 \in A$ and $x_2 \in B$ In this case, $f(x_1) = m + g(x_2)$ . But $1 \leqslant f(x_1) \leqslant m$ and $1 \leqslant g(x_2) \leqslant n$ . It follows that $m < m + 1 \leqslant m + g(x_2) \leqslant m+n$ . This means that $f(x_1) \leqslant m < m + g(x_2) = f(x_1)$ . This is $f(x_1) < f(x_1)$ . This is a contradiction. So, this case is never possible. Case 3) $x_1, x_2 \in B$ Here, we have $m + g(x_1) = m + g(x_2)$ . Cancelling $m$ and noting that $g$ is a bijection, we get that $x_1 = x_2$ . So, it is proven that $h: A\cup B \to I_{m+n}$ is a one to one function. Now, we will prove that its also an onto function. Let $k \in I_{m+n}$ be some arbitrary element. $ 1 \leqslant k \leqslant m+n $ . We will consider two cases here. Case 1) $ 1 \leqslant k \leqslant m $ Here $k \in I_m$ . Since $f$ is an onto function, we have some $x \in A$ such that $f(x) = k$ . So, we have $f(x) \in I_{m+n}$ and $ x \in A \cup B$ . Using the definition of function $h$ , we have $h(x) = f(x) = k$ . So, there is some element $x \in A \cup B$ such that $h(x) = k$ . Case 2) $m + 1 \leqslant k \leqslant m+n$ It follows that $ 1 \leqslant k-m \leqslant n$ . So, $ k-m \in I_n$ and since function $g$ is an onto function, there is some $x \in B$ such that $g(x) = k-m $ . So, $ m + g(x) = k $ . Since $ k \in I_{m+n}$ , we have $ m + g(x) \in I_{m+n}$ and since $x \in B$ , we have $x \in A \cup B$ . So using the definition of function $h$ , we have $h(x) = k$ . So, in both cases, it follows that there is some element $y$ in $A\cup B$ such that $h(x) = y$ . Which means that function $h: A\cup B \to I_{m+n}$ is an onto function. This means that the function $h: A\cup B \to I_{m+n}$ is a bijection. We have $ A\cup B \thicksim I_{m+n}$ and so $A \cup B$ is a finite set. Is this a good proof ?

I tried to prove that the empty set is a subset of any other set, or: $$\emptyset \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in \emptyset \implies x \in B) \vdash \text{T}$$ To me this seemed true because it was ""vacuously true""... somehow. Like it makes sense to call it vacuously true that ""all $0$ items in $\emptyset$ can be found in $B$, yep!"" but that isn't satisfying to me, how do I ""prove"" this is the case? Is $x \in \emptyset$  a false... statement? A false predicate? Something else? Something that results in false so that the implication itself is true.

Improve this question I'm currently solving a quite specific problem and in the final step I made a statement that can be generalised such that: $$((|A|=|B|)\wedge(A\subset B)) \implies (A=B)$$ Whilst this is clearly intuitively true for finite sets $A$ and $B$ and probably a safe statement for my purposes I was wondering if: Is it mathematically sound to make such a statement for finite sets or should there be some further proof? Is it the statement mathematically true in general including infinite sets?","Closed. This question is off-topic . It is not currently accepting answers.

I know the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ is ""more infinite"" than $\mathbb{R}$ , so to speak, but I'm unsure of how to prove that there does or does not exist a surjection onto $\mathbb{R}[X]$ from $\mathbb{R}$ . Is it equinumerous with the power set of $\mathbb{R}$ , or something else more exotic?","What is the cardinality of the set of all polynomials with real coefficients?
