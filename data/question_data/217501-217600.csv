Indeed, we call a linear map $L: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^2$ a rotation if its associated matrix can be written in   the form: $$\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\  \sin(\theta) & \, \  \cos(\theta)  \end{pmatrix}$$ The geometric justification for this definition comes from Fig. 1. We see that: $$L(E^1) = (\cos \theta)E^1 + (\sin \theta)E^2$$ $$L(E^2) = (-\sin \theta)E^1 + (\cos \theta)E^2$$ Thus our definition corresponds precisely to the picture. When the   matrix of the rotation is as above, we say that the rotation is by an   angle $\theta$ . For example, the matrix associated with a rotation by an angle $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is: $$R(\frac{\pi}{2})=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\  1 & \, \, \, 0  \end{pmatrix}$$ Linear Transformation Perspective : I think that $L(E^1)$ and $L(E^2)$ are basis for the column space of the matrix $A$ (hence the basis for image under linear transformation $L$ ). It is known, that $L=AX$ where $A$ is the matrix associated with $L$ and $X=(x_1, x_2)$ is input of $L$ 's definition. Also $AX=b$ where $b$ is the element of 2-dimensional image subspace (correct?). On the basis thereof, I think we get: $$\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\  a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2  \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2  \end{pmatrix}$$ where $A=\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\  a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\  \sin(\theta) & \, \  \cos(\theta)  \end{pmatrix}$ For example, $\cos(\theta)x_1 + \sin(\theta)x_2=b_1$ which seems to equivalent of $L(E^1) = (\cos \theta)E^1 + (\sin \theta)E^2$ .
