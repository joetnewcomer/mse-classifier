If no, what did go wrong ?","If I have a compact set $A$ and a closed subset $\Sigma \subset A$ which only contains isolated points (that is, none of them is a limit point). Does the compactness of $A$ then force $\Sigma$ to have finite cardinality ? Here is my attempt at a proof that the above question can be answered in the positive: Suppose for contradiction that $\Sigma$ contains infinitely many distinct points. EDIT : Then we can construct a sequence of points in $\Sigma$ which consists of distinct points. By compactness of A, this sequence must have a convergent subsequence, and by the fact that $\Sigma$ is closed, this limit lies in $\Sigma$. But then it cannot be a limit point, because all points in $\Sigma$ are isolated. So the subsequence must eventually constant and equal to the limit, contrary to the construction of the sequence.

Thanks in advance for the help!","I would like to show that the function $f(x) = (\textrm{cos}2 \pi x, \textrm{sin}2 \pi x)$ is a quotient map; I have already shown that it is surjective and continuous (the latter by invoking the universal property for functions into a product topology (I am considering $S^1$ as a subspace of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$)). However, I'm stuck trying to prove the final condition for $f$ to be a quotient map. Here's my work so far: Let $U \subset S^1$. Suppose $f^{-1}[U]$ is open in $[0,1]$. Then we need to show that $U$ is open in $S^1$. Let $\bar{y} \in U$; either $\bar{y} = (1,0)$ or $\bar{y} \neq (1,0)$. If $\bar{y} = (1,0)$, then by using the openness of $f^{-1}[U]$, we can deduce that there exists $\epsilon, \epsilon' \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ such that $[0,\epsilon) \cup (\epsilon',1] \subset f^{-1}[U]$ (since $f^{-1}[\{ (1,0) \}] = \{0, 1 \}$). Similarly, if $\bar{y} \neq (1,0)$, there exist $\delta, \delta'\in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ such that $(\delta,\delta') \subset f^{-1}[U]$. Of course these sets, $[0,\epsilon) \cup (\epsilon',1]$ and $(\delta,\delta')$ are open in $[0,1]$. How do I (or can I) proceed from here to show that $U$ is open in $S^1$? On the other hand, I'd also love to hear of some more general methods for showing that the function is a quotient map (maybe certain theorems or something).
