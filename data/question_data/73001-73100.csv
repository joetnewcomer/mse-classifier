0,How to show that some set is open?,How to show that some set is open?,,"I know my question will sound stupid, that it should be simple, and I know there are already a lot of questions related to this topic, but I've spent hours on it and I still don't get how to show that a given set is open or not . I'm completely stuck and I don't exactly know how I'm supposed to start and proceed. I already looked for other posts about the topic ( like this one , for example, for which I did not manage to understand the answers that were given) but it didn't help. Here is a set for which I'm supposed to determine if it is open or not: $$U := \{(x_1 , x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_2 > \sqrt{|x_1|} \}$$ What I know (and what I would like to use): Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. A set $U \subset X$ is open if, for all $x \in U$, there exists $r>0$ such that $B(x,r) \subset U$. For a metric space $(X,d)$ with $x \in X$, an open ball $B(x,r)$ is defined as $\{y \in X : d(x,y) < r \}$ The metric $d$ is not specified, so I guess it's the Euclidean metric: for $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $y=(y_1, y_2)$, we have $d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2}$. So, if I understand all this properly, what I'm supposed to show is that, for all $x \in U$, there exists (or not) $r$ such that $B(x,r) \subset U$, i.e. such that the elements $(y_1, y_2)$ of $B(x,r)$ are such that $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$. And, since these elements are in $B(x,r)$, they are such that $\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2} < r$. So, if I get this right, the elements $y$ of $B(x,r)$ should be such that $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$ and $\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2+(x_2 - y_2)^2} < r$. But then what? I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with all this. How can I ""mix"" those things together so that I have, at the same time, a convenient $r$  and $y_2 > \sqrt{|y_1|}$? I'm missing something, but what? Could anyone give me some hints or indications that would help me to get started? I hate to ask for help in such situations, because it looks like I did not even try, but the thing is that I really don't know where to start. Any help would be, therefore, greatly appreciated.","I know my question will sound stupid, that it should be simple, and I know there are already a lot of questions related to this topic, but I've spent hours on it and I still don't get how to show that a given set is open or not .

Than collection of dimensions in Mayer–Vietoris sequence $$0\to H^0(M)\to\ldots\to H^2(U_1 \cap U_2)\to 0$$ is $$0~~~~~1~~~~~k+\alpha~~~~~k~~~~~0~~~~~\beta~~~~~k~~~~~1~~~~~\gamma~~~~~0~~~~~0$$ whrer $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are dimensions of $0-$th, $1-$th and $2-$th cohomolody respectively. $$1 - (k+\alpha) + k = 0,$$ so $$\alpha = 1.$$ $$\beta - k + 1 - \gamma = 0,$$ so $$\beta = \gamma + (k-1).$$ So $$H^0 = \mathbb{R}$$ $$H^2 = \mathbb{R}^{N}$$ $$H^1 = \mathbb{R}^{N+k-1}$$ Thanks a lot!",,"['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'manifolds']"

Then for each point outside the sequence $\{x_n\}$ has an open neighborhood that has no intersection with $\{x_n\}$ . Here is how I proceeded. Let $\{ y_n \}$ be a subsequence and let $x$ be a point not in $x_n$ . Since $y_n$ is not a convergent sequence it does not converge to $x$ . Therefore, for all $N>0$ , $\exists \epsilon>0$ such that $\{y_{n>N}\} \cap B(x,\epsilon) = \emptyset$ . Since metric space is $T_0$ space, for any point $y_k \in  \{y_{n}\} $ we can find $B(x,\epsilon_k)$ not containing $y_k$ .

(And what's the correct term for such an object? Locus? Fundamental domain?) Writing a line as $$y=ax+b \quad\text{ with }\quad (a,b)\in \Bbb R^2\tag 1$$ each point $(a,b)$ represents a different line, but this misses all vertical lines. The line for $a\to\infty$ is $x=0$ and the same as $a\to-\infty$ . It can be included by representing lines as $$y=\tan(a)\cdot x+b \quad\text{ with }\quad (a,b)\in \left[-\tfrac\pi2,\tfrac\pi2\right]\times\Bbb R\tag 2$$ However $(\pm\frac\pi2,b)$ will all yield the same line, so that these points have to be identified with each other. And the lines $x=c$ , $c\neq0$ are still missing. For 2-dimensonal projective space $M=P\Bbb R^2$ , I think all lines are  represented by $M$ itself:  For a line $g=(g_x:g_y:g_z)$ and a point $P=(x:y:z)$ , the condition that $P\in g$ is $$g\cdot P = g_xx+g_yy+g_zz=0$$ which is symmetric in $g$ and $P$ , and therefore the space of all lines is isomorphic to the space $M$ of all points. To go from $M$ to $\Bbb R^2$ one can remove the line ""at infinity"", which is homeomorphic to $\Bbb S^1$ .  But $M\backslash \Bbb S^1$ has two connected components: One is a Möbius Band and one is a disc, and I have no idea how to interpret them in terms of unique affine lines. Addendum: Meanwhile I found a better representation of lines in the real $a$ , $b$ -plane: Let $g$ be the line $$g:ax+by=a^2+b^2-r^2\tag 3$$ for some constant $r$ , say $r=1$ . Then $a^2+b^2 > r^2$ will yield all possible lines except the ones through the origin. Lines through the origin are realized by $a^2+b^2 = r^2$ where $(a,b)$ and $(-a,-b)$ yield the same line, i.e. we have to identify opposite points of the circle of radius $r$ . Points in the circle do not represent (new) lines, so we effectively poked a hole of radius $r$ into the plane and glued opposite sides of that hole together, yielding a Möbius band. Here is a Desmos plot .  The blue dot is $(a,b)$ in the $a$ , $b$ -plane which represents the blue line and can be dragged around. The red-ish circle represents the hole poked into the plane. Actually, this can be used the other way round: All points in the circle represent lines, except the point at the origin which would represent the line at infinity.  Points in the white area do not represent (new) lines. Again, opposite points of the circle are glued together because they represent the same line through the origin. Moreover, $(3)$ generalizes nicely to higher dimensions: Each point $g\in\Bbb R^n$ with $|g| > r$ represents the unique $n-1$ -dimensional hyper-plane $$L_g: \langle g,x\rangle = |g|^2-r^2\tag 4$$ And the points with $|g|=r$ represent hyper-planes through the origin where $L_g = L_{-g}$ , so that $g$ and $-g$ have to be indentified to achieve uniqueness.  Hence the locus is $n$ -dimensional projective space with one point removed. $L_g$ has a distance of $(g^2-r^2)/|g|$ to the origin, and it is perpendicular to $g$ which means that for all $x,y\in L_g$ we have $\langle x-y,g\rangle=0$ .","What's the 2d-object that's in 1:1 correspondence with all lines in ?

Addendum: Meanwhile I found a better representation of lines in the real , -plane: Let be the line for some constant , say . Then will yield all possible lines except the ones through the origin. Lines through the origin are realized by where and yield the same line, i.e. we have to identify opposite points of the circle of radius . Points in the circle do not represent (new) lines, so we effectively poked a hole of radius into the plane and glued opposite sides of that hole together, yielding a Möbius band. Here is a Desmos plot .  The blue dot is in the , -plane which represents the blue line and can be dragged around. The red-ish circle represents the hole poked into the plane. Actually, this can be used the other way round: All points in the circle represent lines, except the point at the origin which would represent the line at infinity.  Points in the white area do not represent (new) lines. Again, opposite points of the circle are glued together because they represent the same line through the origin. Moreover, generalizes nicely to higher dimensions: Each point with represents the unique -dimensional hyper-plane And the points with represent hyper-planes through the origin where , so that and have to be indentified to achieve uniqueness.

96,Trouble with the proof of Proposition 4.3.18 of Pedersen's Analysis Now,Trouble with the proof of Proposition 4.3.18 of Pedersen's Analysis Now,,"I am currently trying to understand the proof of Proposition 4.3.18 in Pedersen's Analysis now, which reads To each Tychonoff space $X$ there is a Hausdorff compactification $\beta(X)$ , with the property that every continuous function $\Phi: X \to Y$ , where $Y$ is a compact Hausdorff space, extends to a continuous function $\beta \Phi: \beta(X) \to Y$ . The proof starts by noting that $C_b(X)$ is a commutative unital C $^*$ -algebra, and is therefore isometrically isomorphic to a (commutative and unital) C $^*$ -algebra of the form $C(\beta(X))$ , where $\beta(X)$ is a compact Hausdorff space. By the Gelfand duality between the category of commutative and unital C $^*$ -algebras and the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, we can take $\beta(X) = \Omega(C_b(X))$ , the space of characters on $C_b(X)$ . Then we can define a map $\iota: X \to \beta(X)$ , where $\iota(x)(\phi) := \phi(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $\phi \in \beta(X)$ . The particular part of the proof that I am struggling to understand is the proof that $\iota(X)$ is dense in $\beta(X)$ . He argues that if $\iota(X)$ is not dense in $\beta(X)$ , then there is a non-zero continuous map $f: \beta(X) \to \mathbb{C}$ vanishing on $\iota(X)$ . This I understand. He then says that under the identification $C_b(X) = C(\beta(X))$ , this is impossible. This is the sentence I am stuck on. Why is it impossible under this identification? We have that $C_b(X)$ is isometrically isomorphic to $C(\Omega(C_b(X)))$ via the map $\delta: g \mapsto (\delta_g: \Omega(C_b(X)) \to \mathbb{C}, \phi \mapsto \phi(g))$ . I am pretty sure what Pedersen is getting at is that the map $\delta^{-1}(f)$ is zero, but I am not able to show that this is the case. This answer also claims that a similar map is zero. In summary, my question is: Can we show that $\iota(X)$ is dense in $\beta(X)$ by showing that $\delta^{-1}(f) = 0$ ? If so, how do we do this?","I am currently trying to understand the proof of Proposition 4.3.18 in Pedersen's Analysis now, which reads To each Tychonoff space there is a Hausdorff compactification , with the property that every continuous function , where is a compact Hausdorff space, extends to a continuous function . The proof starts by noting that is a commutative unital C -algebra, and is therefore isometrically isomorphic to a (commutative and unital) C -algebra of the form , where is a compact Hausdorff space. By the Gelfand duality between the category of commutative and unital C -algebras and the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, we can take , the space of characters on . Then we can define a map , where for all and . The particular part of the proof that I am struggling to understand is the proof that is dense in . He argues that if is not dense in , then there is a non-zero continuous map vanishing on . This I understand. He then says that under the identification , this is impossible. This is the sentence I am stuck on. Why is it impossible under this identification? We have that is isometrically isomorphic to via the map .

99,Is the one-point compactification terminal in the „category of compactifications“?,Is the one-point compactification terminal in the „category of compactifications“?,,"Let $X$ be a noncompact $KC$ -Space, i.e. a topological space in which every compact set is closed. Call further $\iota_Y\colon X\to Y$ a compactification if $Y$ is compact and $f$ is an embedding with dense image.  Lastly, let $X^\ast := X\cup \{∞\}$ denote the one-point compactification of $X$ , with corresponding embedding $\iota_\ast$ . (Note that since $X$ is not necessarily Hausdorff nor locally compact, $X^\ast$ does not have to be Haussdorff, which is why we weakened the definition of “compactification” accordingly) Question : Is there a unique continuous map $h\colon Y\to X^\ast$ which respects the embeddings, i.e. for which $h\circ \iota_Y = \iota_\ast$ ?
