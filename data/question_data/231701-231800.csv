0,Both $0^0$ and $0^1$ are undefined?,Both  and  are undefined?,0^0 0^1,"Following up on my previous question at What values of $0^0$ would be consistent with the Laws of Exponents? I am still trying to get a handle on $0^0$. It now seems to me that not only is it undefined, but so is $0^1$. What mistake, if any, am I making here? (Yes, I know, you can simply define values for both and hope no contradictions arise, but I don't find such an approach to be very satisfying.) In the natural numbers, exponents greater than 1 are naturally defined as follows: $x^2=xx$ $x^3=xxx=x^2x$ $x^4=xxxx=x^3x$ $x^5=xxxxx=x^4x$ and so on. Therefore $x^{n+1}=x^nx$ for $n\gt 1$. What about $x^0$ and $x^1$? Suppose $x^1x=x^2$. Then $x^1=x^2/x = x$ for $x\ne 0$. Suppose $x^0x=x^1$. Then $x^0=x^1/x = 1$ for $x\ne 0$. Thus $x^0$ and $x^1$ are both undefined for $x\ne 0$.

To be clear: it's not a homework, I'm just trying to understand elementary set's theory concepts by reading solutions. Problem 1 (I don't understand this; I mean - not at all) Let $f: A \to B$, where $A,B$ are non-empty sets, and let $R$ be an equivalence relation in set $B$. We define equivalence relation $S$ in $A$ set by condition: $aSb \Leftrightarrow f(a)R f(b)$ Determine, which inclusion is always true: (a) $f([a]_S) \subseteq [f(a)]_R$ (b) $[f(a)]_R \subseteq f([a]_S)$ Notes: $[a]_S$ is an equivalence class Problem 2 (I suppose, that (a) is true & (b) is false) Which statement is true, and which is false (+ proof): (a) If $f: A \xrightarrow{1-1} B$ and $f(A) \not= B$ then $|A| < |B|$ (b) If $|A| < |B|$ and $C \not= \emptyset$ then $|A \times C| < |B \times C|$ Problem 3 (I don't know, how to think about $\mathbb{Q}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and $\{0,1\}^∗$.) Which sets have the same cardinality: $P(\mathbb{Q}), \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}},\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}^{\mathbb{N}}, \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}, \{ 0,1 \}^*, \{ 0,1 \}^{\mathbb{N}},P(\mathbb{R})$ where $\{ 0,1 \}^*$ means all finite sequences/words that contains $1$ and $0$, for example $000101000100$ or $1010101010101$ etc. $P(A)$ is a Power Set. Problem 4 (I don't understand this; I mean - not at all) What are: maximum/minimum/greatest/lowest elements in set: $\{\{2; 3; 3; 5; 2\}; \{1; 2; 3; 4; 6\}; \{3\}; \{2; 1; 2; 1\}; \{1; 2; 3; 4; 5\}; \{3; 4; 2; 4; 1\}; \{2; 1; 2; 2; 1\}\}$ ordered via subset inclusion Problem 5 How many equivalence relations there are in $\mathbb{N}$ which also are partial order?

Now we consider two cases. Case $1.$ Suppose $x\in A\setminus B$ . Ergo $x\in A\cup B$ . Case $2.$ Suppose $x\in B\setminus A$ . Ergo $x\in A\cup B$ . Since the above cases are exhaustive, $x\in A\cup B$ . Thus if $x\in C$ then $x\in A\cup B$ . Since $x$ is arbitrary, $\forall x(x\in C\rightarrow x\in A\cup B)$ and so $C\subseteq A\cup B$ .
