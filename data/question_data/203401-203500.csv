4,Reeb foliation of the plane and the Palais-Smale condition,Reeb foliation of the plane and the Palais-Smale condition,,"Definition. Let $X$ be a manifold. A smooth map $f:X\to \mathbb R$ is said to satisfy the Palais-Smale condition over $y\in \mathbb R$ if whenever $y_n\to y$ , any sequence $x_n\in f^{-1}(y_n)$ such that $\nabla f(x_n)\to 0$ has a convergent subsequence. If $x_{n_k}\to x_0$ then $\nabla f(x_{n_k})\to \nabla f(x_0)=0$ meaning the gradient field actually has a critical point. I have read an interpretation of the failure of the Palais-Smale condition as ""integral curves of the gradient field disappearing at infinity"". Question 1. What does this mean? The only reasonable meaning I can think of is that integral curves are defined for all time, but do not intersect all fibers of $f$ that it should. Is this the intended meaning? I want to understand the geometry of the Palais-Smale condition with an example. Consider the Reeb foliation of the plane, defined by the surjective submersion $f:\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb R$ given by $(x,y)\to (x^2-1)e^y$ . The gradient is $\nabla f(x,y)=(2xe^y,(x^2-1)e^y)$ and its integral curves are shown below. The submersion $f$ does not satisfy the Palais-Smale condition above zero, since we have the sequence $a_n=(0,-n)$ on which the gradient and the function tend to zero, but there's no convergent subsequence. I would like to understand the picture here. The integral curves certainly slow down as $y\to -\infty $ , but it seems there's only one problematic curve: the $y$ -axis intersects the negative fibers orthogonally, so there's an integral curve of the gradient field heading downwards along it. There's no reason for this curve to be defined only for a finite time, so it seems to be defined for all time (including backwards). Evidently it never meets a non-negative fiber, consistent with the suggested interpretation above. I am confused by this. Any connection on $f$ is a parametric vector field on $\mathbb R^2$ (with real parameter) whose flow lifts the parametric radial field $(x,y)\mapsto x+ty$ whenever it exists. Taking the orthogonal connection seems to give the gradient field, so its integral curves should lift straight paths. Consequently, a gradient field curve defined for all time should lift an infinite straight path in $\mathbb R$ , and therefore intersect all fibers of $f$ . But this contradicts reality: the vertical gradient field curve along the $y$ -axis is defined for all time but does not intersect any non-negative fibers! Question 2. What am I missing here? Looking at the submersion again, there are many more Palais-Smale sequences. Consider for instance $a_n=(-n,-n)$ , on which the gradient and the function tend to zero. Let us restrict our submersion to e.g $ \left\{ x<-1 \right\}$ . Then despite not meeting the Palais-Smale condition, this seems to be a fiber bundle - we can ""comb the fibers downwards"". There don't seem to be any problematic integral curves for the gradient field. Question 3. What is the geometric interpretation of the failure of the Palais-Smale condition for $f|_ {\left\{ x<-1 \right\}}$ ? Question 4. Why does the sequence $(0,-n)$ ""see"" a problem that $(-n,-n)$ does not? Question 5. Why did it matter at all the the derivative tends to zero on the above sequences?

6,About degree of a smooth map between Manifolds,About degree of a smooth map between Manifolds,,"So from chapter 5 of Milnor's Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint, there are two theorems about the degree of a smooth map where the degree is defined as follows: $f: M \to N$ is a smooth map between manifolds of same dimension, M is compact without boundary and N is connected. $deg(f;y) = \sum_{x \in f^{-1}(y)} sign(df_x)$ , where $y$ varies over the set of regular values of $f$ . From the fact that $\#f^{-1}y$ is a locally constant function and determinant is a smooth map, we can say that $deg(f;y)$ is locally constant. Now the theorems are as follows: Theorem A : The integer $deg(f; y)$ does not depend on the choice of regular value y. Theorem B : If $f$ is smoothly homotopic to $g$ , then $deg$ $f$ = $deg$ $g$ . For the proof of theorem A, I thought about using the fact that since $deg(f;y)$ is a locally constant function and $N$ being a connected manifold, we should have that $deg(f;y)$ is constant but then $y$ varies over all regular values of f which may not be even connected. I think I have to use Sard's theorem but I have got no clue.

The coordinate system used there is however not what I am using. In my field, coordinates follow the Fick gimbal. The transforms for this system are: $$\begin{align} x &= \rho\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta}\\ y &= \rho\sin{\phi}\\ z &= \rho\cos{\phi}\cos{\theta} \end{align}$$ and the inverses: $$\begin{align} \rho &= \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\\ \theta &= \tan^{-1} \frac{x}{z}\\ \phi &= \tan^{-1} \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+z^2}}\\ \end{align}$$ That is, $\theta$ is the azimuthal angle/rotation in the $x$ - $z$ plane, and $\phi$ the elevation/rotation out of the $x$ - $z$ plane. Now, i would like to determine the expression for angular velocity of a point in this coordinate system. I know from secondary sources that the answer is $$ v=\sqrt{\dot\theta^2\cos^2\phi+\phi^2} $$ but i have trouble arriving at it.

Following the steps of the latter link to find $\boldsymbol{\hat\rho}$ , $\boldsymbol{\hat\theta}$ , and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}$ , we take the derivative of the spherical coordinate representation $(\rho\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta}, \rho\sin{\phi}, \rho\cos{\phi}\cos{\theta})$ with respect to $\rho$ , $\theta$ , and $\phi$ , respectively, and then normalize each one. This yields: $$\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\hat\rho} \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\theta}  \\ \boldsymbol{\hat\phi} \end{bmatrix}  = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\phi\sin\theta & \sin\phi & \cos\phi\cos\theta \\                    \cos\phi\cos\theta & 0 & -\cos\phi\sin\theta \\  -\sin\phi\sin\theta & \cos\phi & -\cos\theta\sin\phi \end{bmatrix}    \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{\hat x} \\ \mathbf{\hat y} \\ \mathbf{\hat z} \end{bmatrix}$$ If i understand correctly, each row is a unit vector here.

11,Geometric interpretation of torsion for a non-linear (Ehresmann) connection,Geometric interpretation of torsion for a non-linear (Ehresmann) connection,,"In [1, eq. $7.8.10$ ] the author gives the coordinate expression for the torsion of a non-linear connection. Here a non-linear connection, in my understanding, is essentially a splitting of the double tangent bundle $TTM$ in a horizontal and vertical part (although his precise definition [1, def. $7.2.1$ ] is quite a bit more involved, but I can imagine that in the end it is equivalent). The formula for torsion in natural coordinates $(x,y)$ in the tangent bundle reads $$ T^k_{ij}(x,y) = \bar\partial_j N^k_i(x,y) - \bar\partial_i N^k_j(x,y),\qquad \bar\partial_i \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, $$ where $N^i_j$ are the connection coefficients. This indeed reduces to the usual expression for the torsion tensor $T^k_{ij} = \Gamma^k_{ij} - \Gamma^k_{ji}$ when the connection is linear. For linear connections my intuitive understanding of torsion has always been that it measures the degree to which an infinitesimal parallelogram does not close on itself. More precisely, given two vectors $v,w\in T_pM$ , if we infinitesimally parallel transport $u$ along $v$ and $v$ along $u$ then the difference $\delta$ between the two outcomes is given precisely by the torsion tensor $$ \delta^k = T^k_{ij}v^i w^j.$$ However, I noticed that this is not true anymore when the connection is non-linear. Indeed, for homogeneous non-linear connections, i.e. $ N(x,\lambda y) = \lambda N(x,y)$ , I find that $$\delta^k = (\bar\partial_j N^k_i(x,v) - \bar\partial_i N^k_j(x,u))u^iv^j.$$ Although the expression in between brackets looks a lot like the torsion of the non-linear connection, it is not the same, because of the additional dependence on $u$ and $v$ in $N^i_j$ . My standard geometrical interpretation of torsion is apparently not valid anymore in the non-linear realm, so my question comes down to the following: Is there an alternative geometric interpretation of the torsion of a non-linear connection?

What I did so far: Since $p$ is a submersion (hence an open map) and $\Bbb T^2$ is compact, $p(\Bbb T^2)$ is both an open subset of $\Bbb S^1$ and compact, so $p$ is onto.

Given a vector bundle $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ with fibre $\mathbb{C}^r$ and Group $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ they associate for each $k\leq r$ a cohomology class of $M$ and call it the $k$ -th Chern class. It looks like cohomology is $H^*(M,\mathbb{C})$ and not $H^*(M,\mathbb{R})$ . Can some one clarify what is happening here? Given $\pi:E\rightarrow M$ , let $p:P\rightarrow M$ be the associated $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ bundle.  We have $$\text{det}\left(\lambda I-\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{-1}}X\right)=\sum_{k=0}^rf_k(X)\lambda^{r-k}$$ for $X\in \mathfrak{gl}(r,\mathbb{C})$ .  Here $f_k:\mathfrak{gl}(r,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ are $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ invariant degree $k$ homogeneous poly. on $\mathfrak{gl}(r,\mathbb{C})$ . These $f_k$ can be seen as $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ invariant symmetric multilinear map $$\underbrace{\mathfrak{gl}(r,\mathbb{C})\times\cdots\times\mathfrak{gl}(r,\mathbb{C})}_{k-\text{times}}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ giving an element of $I_{\mathbb{C}}(G)$ . After fixing a connection on the principal bundle $P(M,G)$ , there is a complex valued version of Weil homomorphism $I_{\mathbb{C}}(G)\rightarrow H^*(M,\mathbb{C})$ . These $f_k\in I^k_{\mathbb{C}}(G)$ gives an element $c_k$ in $H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{C})$ . But, they write $c_k\in H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{R})$ . What am I missing here? Does it mean $c_k\in H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{C})$ is image of some element in $H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{R})$ under some  map $H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{R})\rightarrow H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{C})$ ? One which  induce from $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ defined as $a\mapsto a+i 0$ ? EDIT : The book Calculus to cohomology by Ib Madsen and Jxrgen Tornehave says in remark $18.12$ (page $189$ ) that Definition $18.3$ (of Chern class) gives cohomology classes in $H^*(M,\mathbb{C})$ , but actually all classes lies in Real cohomology . This follows from (some result before). There was no clear explanation (for me) for that comment. EDIT : User Jessica L (last seen 7 years ago) said Chern classes can be defined by topological means (see Milnor's book on characteristic classes), which yields elements $c_k(V) \in H^{2k}(M;\mathbb{Z})$ .  The normalization in the Chern-Weil theory is chosen so that the associated elements of de Rham cohomology groups $H^{2k}(M;\mathbb{R})$ agree with the integral elements, and thus integrate to give integers. I think this answer and my question are related. So, any reference (which contains more details) for this  are also welcome. EDIT : Kobayashi and Nomizu (Foundations of Differential geometry) in page $59$ says the following. Let $P(M,G)$ be a principal fibre bundle over a paracompact manifold $M$ with group $G$ which is a connected Lie group. It is known that $G$ is diffeomorphic with a direct product of any of its maximal compact subgroups $H$ and a Euclidean space (Iwasawa). By the same reasoning as above the structure group cann be reduced to $H$ . See that $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ is a connected Lie group, $U(r,\mathbb{C})$ is a maximal compact group and this says that $GL_r(\Bbb C) \cong U(r) \times \Bbb R^{r^2}$ . Using above result, we see that structure group $GL(r,\mathbb{C})$ for $P(M,G)$ can be reduced to $U(r,\mathbb{C})$ . Edit : As structure group $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ of $P\rightarrow M$ can be reduced to $U(n)$ , we get a principal $U(n)$ bundle $Q\rightarrow M$ . Now, Lie algebra of $U(n)$ is $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ of skew Hermitian matrices. For $X\in \mathfrak{u}(n)$ , I believe (I checked it for some examples) that $\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{-1}}X$ has characteristic polynomial with real coefficients. So,  we have $$\text{det}\left(\lambda I-\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{-1}}X\right)=\sum_{k=0}^rf_k(X)\lambda^{r-k}$$ for $X\in \mathfrak{u}(r,\mathbb{C})$ .  Here $f_k:\mathfrak{u}(r,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . I now consider Chern Weil Homomorphism for $Q\rightarrow M$ and these $f_k$ give real cohomology classes $H^{2k}(M,\mathbb{R})$ .

That is to prove that we need not worry about convention used to define Banach manifold. Does anyone have a reference for an article or such that treats these questions? I have looked into some books on Banach manifolds but without any luck. If it is not the case that every locally Banach, Hausdorff space is regular, then does anyone have a counterexample at hand? (If this is the case the article I am trying to use would be incorrect on this point).",,"['general-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'banach-spaces', 'separation-axioms']"

My question is: when does the covariant Hodge Laplacian commute with the covariant derivative? In other words, when is the commutator $[d_A^*, F(A)\wedge]$ above equal to zero? For example, this is the case when $A$ is flat. Is there a different condition on the connection, such that this is true? It is difficult for me to see at the moment, since the codifferential $d_A^*$ doesn't distribute nicely over a wedge product. However, the operator $[d_A^*, F(A)]$ transforms tensorially, so imposing the zero condition on it feels like a natural condition.",,"['differential-geometry', 'curvature', 'laplacian', 'connections', 'hodge-theory']"

If I consider the FLRW metric as : $\text{d}\tau^2=\text{d}t^2-a(t)^2\bigg[\dfrac{\text{d}r^2}{1-kr^2}+r^2(\text{d}\theta^2+\text{sin}^2\theta\text{d}\phi^2)\bigg]$ with $g_{tt}=1$, $\quad g_{rr}=\dfrac{a(t)^2}{1-kr^2}$ and $\quad g_{\theta\theta}=\dfrac{g_{\phi\phi}}{\text{sin}^2\theta}=a(t)^2 r^2$ It is said in this book that, despite of the utility of comoving coordinates, the dependance of time in scale factor $a(t)$ can be better understood if we consider a set of coordinates called ""Free Fall coordinates"" and noted $(\tilde{x}^\mu, \mu=0,1,2,3)$ with a metric locally Lorentzian near to the origin $\tilde{x}^{\mu}=0$ : $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}(0)\tilde{x}^{\alpha}\tilde{x}^{\beta}+\,.......\quad\text{(eq1)}$ with $\eta_{00}=-\eta_{11}=-\eta_{22}=-\eta_{33}=1\quad\quad$ and $\eta_{\mu\neq\nu}=0$ and $g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}=\dfrac{\partial^2 g_{\mu\nu}}{\partial \tilde{x}^{\alpha}\partial \tilde{x}^{\beta}}$ Moreover, one takes the expression of classic geodesics : $\dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg(g_{\mu\nu}(x)\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg)-\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial g_{\lambda\nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\lambda}}{\text{d}\tau}\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}=0\quad\quad\mu=0,1,2,3\quad \text{(eq2)}$ The author says that, by applying $\text{(eq1)}$ into the relation $\text{(eq2)}$, one gets, at first order, the following relation : $\dfrac{\text{d}^2 \tilde{x}^{\alpha}}{\text{d}\tau^2} = -\eta^{\alpha\gamma}\bigg[g_{\mu\gamma,\nu\beta}-\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu,\gamma\beta}\bigg]\tilde{x}^{\beta}\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\text{d}\tau}\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\quad\quad\text{(eq3)}$ I can't manage to obtain the $\text{eq(3)}$ from $\text{eq(1)}$ and $\text{eq(2)}$, if someone could help me for the details of the demonstration, this would be nice. For the moment, if I put the definition of $g_{\nu\mu}$ into $\text{eq(2)}$,  I get : $\dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg(g_{\mu\nu}(x)\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg)=\bigg(\dfrac{\text{d}g_{\mu\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg)\,\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}+g_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{\text{d}^2x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau^2}\quad\quad \text{eq(4)}$ If I separate the two terms on RHS on $\text{eq(4)}$ : $\bigg(\dfrac{\text{d}g_{\mu\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg)\,\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}=\dfrac{\text{d}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg(\eta_{\mu\nu}+\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}(0)\tilde{x}^{\alpha}\tilde{x}^{\beta}\bigg)\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}=$ $\dfrac{1}{2}\,g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}(0)\bigg[\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\alpha}}{\text{d}\tau}\,\tilde{x}^{\beta}+\tilde{x}^{\alpha}\,\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\beta}}{\text{d}\tau}\bigg]\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}=$ $g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}(0)\bigg[\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\alpha}}{\text{d}\tau}\,\tilde{x}^{\beta}\bigg]\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}$ Concerning the second term on RHS of $\text{eq(4)}$, maybe I could write : $g_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{\text{d}^2x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau^2}=\eta_{\mu\nu}\dfrac{\text{d}^2x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau^2}$ by neglecting the term $\dfrac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu,\alpha\beta}(0)\tilde{x}^{\alpha}\tilde{x}^{\beta}$ in the expression of $g_{\mu\nu}$. Another problem, How can I transform the second term on LHS of $\text{(eq2)}$ : $-\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial g_{\lambda\nu}}{\partial x^{\mu}}\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\lambda}}{\text{d}\tau}\dfrac{\text{d}x^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}\quad\quad \text{eq(5)}$ ?? Indeed, it seems that we can deduce from this term the wanted term : $\dfrac{1}{2}\,\eta^{\alpha\gamma}\,g_{\mu\nu,\gamma\beta}\tilde{x}^{\beta}\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\text{d}\tau}\dfrac{\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\text{d}\tau}$ But $\tilde{x}$ coordinates (""Free Fall coordinates"") appear in this last expression instead of ""Comobile coordinates"" $x^{\mu}$ into $\text{eq(5)}$ , so I don't know how to get it ? Finally, to do the link between ""Fre Fall coordinates"" and ""Comoving coordinates"", can I write : $g_{\mu\nu}\text{d}x^{\mu}\text{d}x^{\nu}=\eta_{\alpha\beta}\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\alpha}\text{d}\tilde{x}^{\beta}$ ?? Any help is welcome UPDATE 1 : You can find below 2 image captures resuming the different equations (mostly important eq(4.4), eq(4.5); eq(4.6) and eq(4.87)) : UPDATE 2 : Thanks for your demo.

Suppose there exist isomorphic subbundles $V \subseteq \tilde V,W \subseteq \tilde W$ of rank $k-1$ , i.e $V \cong W$ . Then we have the following claim: Proposition: $\tilde V,\tilde W$ are isomorphic as vector bundles, and so are the quotients $\tilde V/V \cong \tilde W/W$ . Question: I would like to find a proof of the proposition which does not involve introducing a metric. Here is my proof (using metrics): Fix orientations on $\tilde V,\tilde W$ . Let $\Phi:V \to W$ be an isomorphism. Put a (smooth) metric on $W$ , and pull it back by $\Phi$ to $V$ , thus making $\Phi$ as isometry. Now extend the metrics to $\tilde V,\tilde W$ . Since the ""codimension"" of $V$ in $\tilde V$ is $1$ (and so for $W, \tilde W$ ), there exist a unique isometric bundle isomorphism $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ making $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}:\tilde V \to \tilde W$ an isometric orientation preserving bundle isomorphism. Note that this $\Phi^{\perp}$ is smooth . In particular, we showed that $\tilde V \cong \tilde W$ , and $\tilde V/V \cong V^{\perp} \cong W^{\perp} \cong \tilde W/W$ . Edit: (elaboration on the construction of $\Phi^{\perp}$ ) Here is an explicit construction of $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ : Let $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k $ be a local positive orthonormal frame for $\tilde V$ such that $\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_{k-1}\}=V$ and $\text{span}(v_k)=V^{\perp}$ . (such a frame can always be chosen locally, see below). Now, define $$\Phi^{\perp}(v_k)=\Phi^{\perp}\big(\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big):=\star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big(\Phi(v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \Phi(v_{k-1})\big), \tag{1}$$ where $\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}:\Lambda_{k-1}(\tilde V) \to \Lambda_{1}(\tilde V)=\tilde V$ is the Hodge dual of $\tilde V$ which is defined via the metric and orientation (same for $\tilde W$ ). It is immediate from the definitions of the Hodge dual, that $$\Phi^{\perp}(v_k) \in \big(\text{span}\{\Phi(v_1),\dots,\Phi(v_{k-1})\}\big)^{\perp}=W|_{U}^{\perp},$$ where the last equality follows from the assumed surjectivity of $\Phi:V \to W$ . ( $U \subseteq M$ is the small set over which we have our local frame). This makes $\Phi^{\perp}$ an isometric isomorphism $V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ . Moreover, this makes $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}:\tilde V \to \tilde W$ an isometric orientation preserving isomorphism (indeed, it takes the positive orthonormal frame $v_1,\dots,v_k$ of $\tilde V$ to a positive orhtonormal frame in $\tilde W$ ). In particular this shows $\Phi^{\perp}:V^{\perp} \to W^{\perp}$ is well defined, i.e it does not depend on the frame we chose. The reason is that $V^{\perp},W^{\perp}$ are of rank $1$ , and there are only two isometric maps between $1$ -dim inner product spaces. Here we know how to ""choose the right one"" at each fiber, due to the requirement that the ""big"" combined map $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}$ will be orientation-preserving. Moreover, the continuity of the orientations, implies this choice is ""smooth"" along  changing fibers. It is here that we use the fact $\tilde V,\tilde W$ were orientable. An extended comment regarding the uniqueness (and smoothness) of $\Phi^{\perp}$ : We didn't really had a choice in constructing $\Phi^{\perp}$ . The uniqueness is a ""pointwise-linear algebra"" phenomenon. Indeed, suppose $\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}$ is an isometric orientation preserving isomorphism. Then, since orientation preserving isometries commute with Hodge duals we must have $$ \Phi^{\perp}(v_k)=\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_k)=\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)\big(\star_{\tilde V}^{k-1}(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big)=$$ $$ \star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \bigwedge^{k-1}\big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_1 \wedge \dots \wedge v_{k-1})\big)=\star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \big(\Phi \oplus \Phi^{\perp}\big)(v_{k-1})\big)=$$ $$ \star_{\tilde W}^{k-1}\big( \Phi (v_1) \wedge \dots \wedge \Phi (v_{k-1})\big).$$ This is exactly our definition in equation $(1)$ . In particular this uniqueness implies $\Phi^{\perp}$ is smooth, since it takes a smooth frame to a smooth frame. A comment regarding the existence of a suitable frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k$ : We can always choose a local orthonormal frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1}$ for $V$ . Now, we can also choose an orthonormal frame $v_k$ for $V^{\perp}$ . If we restrict everything to be over a connected subset $U \subseteq M$ , then we must have that the resulting frame $v_1,\dots,v_{k-1},v_k$ for $\tilde V$ is positively oriented or negatively oriented.

Then there exist coordinates $(u_1, \ldots, u_n)$ such that $X_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial u_i}$ if and only if $[X_i, X_j]=0$. He uses induction on $k=0, \ldots , n$, and claim ""for $k=0$ there is nothing to say"", and start proving the general case. But I don't feel really comfortable with that, since $k=0$ is literally nothing. So I would like to see at least the case $k=1$. But my problem arises when I discover that the arguments he uses for the general case are not valid for $k=1$. So, how to do it?

My attempt: We have a well-known result stating : On each compact oriented n-surface in ${\Bbb R}^{n+1}$,there exists a point p such that the second fundamental form at p is definite. Now by the definition of the second fundamental form to be definite at some $p \in S$, it follows that either both the principal curvatures are positive (i.e. $k_{1} (p) , k_{2} (p) >0 $) or both the principal curvatures are negative (i.e. $k_{1} (p) , k_{2} (p) <0 $). So given our conditions that $k_{1} (p) = 1, k_{2} (p) = -1$ ($\forall p \in S$), the contra-positive statement of the above mentioned result yields us that our required S cannot be compact .

98,Show that the fibre $\pi^{-1}(p)$ is a regular submanifold,Show that the fibre  is a regular submanifold,\pi^{-1}(p),"Exercise 6.4 of the book Manifolds and Differential Geometry (Jeffrey M. Lee, 2009) states the following: Show that if $(E,M,\pi, F)$ is a (smooth) fiber bundle, then $\pi: E \rightarrow M$ is a submersion and each fiber $\pi^{-1}(p)$ is a regular submanifold which is diffeomorphic to $F$ . Show that if both $F$ and $M$ are connected, then E is connected. I think I can proof the first statement: Because $(E,M,\pi,F)$ is a fibre bundle, for each $p\in M$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ which contains $p$ and a diffeomorphism $\Psi:\pi^{-1}(U) \rightarrow U\times F$ such that $\pi|_U=\Psi\circ \mbox{proj}_U$ (composition is by the right). Hence $d\pi|_U = d\Psi\circ d\,\mbox{proj}_U$ ; since $\Psi$ is a diffeomorphism, $d\Psi$ is bijective. Clearly $d\,\mbox{proj}_U$ has constant rank equal to $\mbox{dim }(M)$ and thus it follows that $\pi$ is a submersion. In order to see that $\pi^{-1}(p)$ for $p\in M$ is a regular submanifold of $E$ of dimension $k$ , I have to find a chart $(A,\tau)$ of the smooth manifold $E$ such that $$ \tau\big(A\cap\pi^{-1}(p)\big) = \tau(A)\cap)\big(\mathbb{R}^k \times\{c\}\big), $$ where $c$ is an element of $\mathbb{R}^{d-k}$ (typically $c=0$ ) and $d=\mbox{dim }(E)$ . So, my questions are: 1- Is right my proof? 2.- How I can see the fibre over $p$ is a regular submanifold? How proof that is diffeomorphic to $F$ ? 3.- If $M$ and $F$ are connected, then $U\times F$ is connected for all open set $U\subset M$ and thus the open set $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is connected in $E$ thanks to the diffeomorphism $\Psi$ .
