0,Why is the triangle inequality equivalent to $a^4+b^4+c^4\leq 2(a^2b^2+b^2c^2+c^2a^2)$?,Why is the triangle inequality equivalent to ?,a^4+b^4+c^4\leq 2(a^2b^2+b^2c^2+c^2a^2),"Consider the existential problem of a triangle with side lengths $a,b,c\geq0$ . Such a triangle exists if and only if the three triangle inequalities $$a+b\geq c,\quad b+c\geq a\quad\text{and}\quad c+a\geq b\tag{0}$$ are all satisfied. Alternatively, if $\ell_1\leq\ell_2\leq\ell_3$ are the values of $a,b$ and $c$ ordered in ascending order, then the triangle exists iff $\ell_1+\ell_2\geq\ell_3$ . Interestingly, the three triangle inequalities can be recast into a single quartic polynomial inequality. Let $0,x,y\in\mathbb R^2$ be the three vertices of the triangle, with $\|x\|=a,\,\|y\|=b$ and $\|x-y\|=c$ . Then $c^2=\|x-y\|^2=\|x\|^2-2\langle x,y\rangle+\|y\|^2=a^2+b^2-2\langle x,y\rangle$ . Therefore $x^Ty=\langle x,y\rangle=\frac{1}{2}(a^2+b^2-c^2)$ and $$\pmatrix{x^T\\ y^T}\pmatrix{x&y}=\frac{1}{2}\pmatrix{2a^2&a^2+b^2-c^2\\ a^2+b^2-c^2&2b^2}.\tag{1}$$ The RHS of $(1)$ must be positive semidefinite because the LHS is a Gram matrix. Conversely, if the RHS is indeed PSD, it can be expressed as a Gram matrix. Hence we obtain $x$ and $y$ and the triangle exists. As $2a^2$ and $2b^2$ are already nonnegative, the RHS of $(1)$ is positive semidefinite if and only if $(2a^2)(2b^2)-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2\geq0$ , by Sylvester's criterion. That is, the triangle exists if and only if $$-(a^4+b^4+c^4)+2(a^2b^2+b^2c^2+c^2a^2)\geq0.\tag{2}$$ This polynomial inequality can be derived by more elementary means. See circle-circle intersection on Wolfram MathWorld. The geometric explanation for the necessity of $(2)$ is given by Heron's formula , which states that the square root of the LHS is four times the area of the triangle. Since both $(0)$ and $(2)$ are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the required triangle, the two sets of conditions must be equivalent to each other. Here are my questions.

16,Finding the maximum area of a quadrilateral when three points are given,Finding the maximum area of a quadrilateral when three points are given,,"I am working on problems in the chapter ""Applications of Derivatives"". I encountered the following problem: Question: Four points A,B,C, and D lie in that order on the parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ . The coordinates of A,B, and D are $(-2,3)$ , $(-1,1)$ , and $(2,7)$ respectively. The coordinates of C for which the area of the quadrilateral ABCL is maximum is: (A) $(1/2,7/4)$ (B) $(1/2,-7/4)$ (C) $(-1/2,7/4)$ (D) $(-1/2,-7/4)$ [Correct Answer : Option (A)] My Approach: Introduction: I found the equation of the parabola using the given coordinates. Then computed the area of the quadrilateral by considering an arbitrary value for point C. Then I found the coordinates of C by maximizing the value of A by using the concept of maxima. What I am looking for is an alternate proof or a property which relates the coordinates of third vertex of a quadrilateral when three points are fixed under certain constraints, to maximize the area. We have been given the coordinates A $(-2,3)$ ,B $(-1,1)$ and D $(2,7)$ . Since these points lie on the given parabola $y=ax^2+bx+c$ , on substituting the coordinates of A,B and D we get the following linear equations in variables $a,b,$ and $c$ : $4a-2b+c=3$ $a-b+c=1$ $4a+2b+c=7$ On solving these three equations, I got $a=1,b=1,$ and $c=1$ . So the equation of the parabola is $y=x^2+x+1$ . In the following graph, the points A,B and D are fixed, whereas point C is a variable point on the parabola. We need to find the coordinates of point C such that the area of the quadrilateral is maximum. In coordinate geometry, I came across the following formula to compute the area of a $n$ sided polygon when the coordinates are given: Area A $= \frac 1 2 \left( \left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_1 & x_2 \\y_1 & y_2 \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_2 & x_3 \\y_2 & y_3 \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_3 & x_4 \\y_3 & y_4 \\ \end{array} } \right|+ \dots +\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_{n-1} & x_n \\y_{n-1} & y_n \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_n & x_1 \\y_n & y_1 \\ \end{array} } \right| \right)$ where $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),\dots ,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1}),(x_n,y_n)$ are coordinates of the $n$ vertices of the $n$ sided polygon taken in order. Here |.| denotes determinant of the matrix. Now in the given question we are supposed to find the maximum area of a quadrilateral (4 sided polygon). So using the above formula, we get the following: Area A $= \frac 1 2 \left( \left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_1 & x_2 \\y_1 & y_2 \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_2 & x_3 \\y_2 & y_3 \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_3 & x_4 \\y_3 & y_4 \\ \end{array} } \right|+\left| {\begin{array}{cc}x_4 & x_1 \\y_4 & y_1 \\ \end{array} } \right|  \right)$ where where $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3),$ and $(x_4,y_4)$ are the coordinates of points A,B,C, and D respectively. Now let the $x$ -coordinate of point C be $h$ . So its $y$ -coordinate (from the equation of parabola) is $h^2+h+1$ . So coordinates of point C be represented as $(h^2+h+1)$ . After substituting the values of the coordinates in the equation for area, I obtained the following equation: Area A $=\frac 1 2 -3h^2+3h+18$ Area A attains the maximum value at $h=1/2$ . Hence the coordinates of point C is $(1/2,7/4)$ - option (A). My answer is correct. Doubt: Is there any other formal way of solving this problem? Is there any property for choosing the fourth vertex of the quadrilateral when three vertices are given, in order to get the maximum area under given constraints?

The coordinates of C for which the area of the quadrilateral ABCL is maximum is: (A) (B) (C) (D) [Correct Answer : Option (A)] My Approach: Introduction: I found the equation of the parabola using the given coordinates. Then computed the area of the quadrilateral by considering an arbitrary value for point C. Then I found the coordinates of C by maximizing the value of A by using the concept of maxima. What I am looking for is an alternate proof or a property which relates the coordinates of third vertex of a quadrilateral when three points are fixed under certain constraints, to maximize the area. We have been given the coordinates A ,B and D . Since these points lie on the given parabola , on substituting the coordinates of A,B and D we get the following linear equations in variables and : On solving these three equations, I got and .

Let length of a line segment $L$ be $1$ . Also define variable $r$ (ratio) that can be any real number on the interval $(0;1)$ . Let us put the vertical line segment with length $L$ starting from the point $(0;0)$ on the orthogonal coordinate system; the other point of this line segment is $(0;L)$ . Put the next line segment with the following rules: Starting point should be located on the X axis, let us assume it as a point $(X(n);0)$ , where $X(n)>X(n-1)$ ; Lets treat the previous line segment like a vector, multiply it by $r$ . The end point of this vector is the end point of the new line segment. Here is the example which displays $n = 6$ triangles built with the $L = 1$ and $r = 0.8$ . Initially I tried to solve the following tasks: Find the function $f(L, r, n)$ which will return the sum of the areas of $n$ triangles giving the length of the line segment is $L$ and a ratio is $r$ ; Define the limit of the $f(L, r, n)$ with $L = 1$ ; $r \to 1$ and $n \to \infty$ ; Assuming that these issues were solved before, what is the correct way to call this task and where I can find the information about it? Here is what I have discovered so far. First, let us find one of the angles of the $n$ -th triangle. Define $\beta(n)$ as an angle between $(n-1)$ -th and $n$ -th line segment; $\alpha(n)$ as an angle between X axis and the $n$ -th line segment. For the sake of simplicity let us use $\alpha_N$ and $\beta_N$ instead of a function form. Since the first triangle is the right triangle, $\sin(\alpha_1)$ is defined by the known relations: $$\sin(\alpha_1) = \frac {r * L}{L} = r$$ Using the law of sines, investigate the second triangle. $$\frac {\sin(\alpha_2)}{L*r} = \frac{\sin(\pi - alpha(1))}{L};$$ $$\sin(\alpha_2) = \sin(\pi - \alpha_1) * r = \sin(\alpha_1) * r$$ Since there is no dependency from the right triangle in this formula, we can generalize the result: $$\sin(\alpha_n) = \sin(\alpha_{n-1})*r$$ or for the calculation simplicity sake: $$\alpha_n = \arcsin(r^n)$$ Knowing that the sum of the angles of the triangle is $\pi$ , we get the following: $$\pi = \alpha_n + \beta_n + (\pi - \alpha_{n-1});$$ $$0 = \alpha_n + \beta_n - \alpha_{n-1};$$ $$\beta_n = \alpha_{n-1} - \alpha_n$$ Find the area of the $n$ -th triangle with the following formula: $$S(n) = \frac 1 2 * L * L* r * \sin(\beta_n) = \frac 1 2 * L^2 * r * \sin(\beta_n)$$ Such formula is acceptable for the calculations, but we can represent it in a different way. $$\sin(\beta_n) = \sin(\alpha_{n-1} - \alpha_n) = \sin\alpha_{n-1}*\cos\alpha_n - \sin\alpha_n*\cos\alpha_{n-1}=$$ $$ = r^{n-1}*\sqrt{1-r^{2n}} - r^n*\sqrt{1-r^{2n-2}} $$ Since that is the solution for the first question, I had tried to solve the second, but with no avail. $$Sum(L,r) = \frac 1 2 *L^2 \lim_{r \to 1, n \to \infty} (r * \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sin(\beta_n)) $$ I also had tried to change the way of area calculation to the sum of the trapezoids, but it wasn't successful as well. $$S_t(n) = \frac {L*r^{n-1} + L*r^n} 2 * \cos\alpha_n*(1-r)*L$$ I was unable to apply any known to me technique (such as L'Hôpital's rule, Taylor series investigation) to reach the solution, so I resorted to approximate solution. I have managed to calculate the result of the function $f$ with the $L = 1$ ; $r = 0.999999$ ; $n = 100000000$ : $$f(1,0.999999,10^8) = 0.7853973776669734$$ The length of the whole construct was approximately equal to $100.6931$ , knowing that the side of the $n$ -th triangle on the X axis is: $$B(n) = L*r*(\frac {\cos\alpha_n} r - \cos\alpha_{n-1}))$$ The result is more or less close to the $\frac \pi 4 (0.7853981633974483)$ , which was surprising. I had tried to apply this knowledge (the infinite sum of $\sin\beta_n$ should approach to $\frac \pi 2$ ; knowledge that $\int_0^{+\infty}\frac {dx}{(1+x)*\sqrt{x}} = \pi$ ), but was unable to do so. So here is the final composite question: Are there any errors in my calculations? Is there a way to solve this without resorting to approximations?

27,Regular octagon inscribed in a square,Regular octagon inscribed in a square,,"Problem: The corners of a 2 meter square are cut off to form a regular octagon. What is the length of the sides of the resulting octagon? From the picture below, the octagon would form a right isosceles, specifically a right isosceles triangle on the corners. The sides of the octagon were set to "" x "" and the legs of the triangle were set to $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$. Then add the following cuts of a side of the square: $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$ + x + $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$ = 2 m, which results to x = 0.828 m. My inquiry is that, from what I know or learned, a right isosceles triangle has an angle ratio of $45-45-90$ and a side ratio of $1-1-\sqrt{2}$ or in algebra: $x-x-x{\sqrt{2}}$. In the problem he set the hypotenuse as $x$ instead and the legs of the triangle as $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$, which I think is fine. But shouldn't setting the hypotenuse as $x\sqrt{2}$ and the sides as $x$ should equal the first equation? $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$ + x + $\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}$ = 2 should also equal $x + x\sqrt{2} + x = 2$ where 2 is the length of a side of a square. I don't think multiplying or dividing both sides by $\sqrt{2}$ is the answer as that would not satisfy both equations. This sounds like an easy problem, but it it's confusing me.

The area is given by $\pi ab$ where $b$ and $a$ are half the length of the major and minor axis respectively. From both equations we have $1+2x=x^2+y^2\iff (x-1)^2+y^2=2$ . The largest value of $z$ with this constraint is $z(1+\sqrt{2})$ and least $z(1-\sqrt{2})$ . Thus follows that the vertices of the major axis are $(1+\sqrt{2},0,3+2\sqrt{2})$ and $(1-\sqrt{2},0,3-2\sqrt{2})$ . Thus the length of the major axis is $||(2\sqrt{2},0,4\sqrt{2})||=\sqrt{40}$ which follows $b=\sqrt{10}$ . I don't know how to obtain the vertices of the minor axis.

Then, $b\cos A = c_1$ , $a\cos B = c_2$ , so $b\cos A + a\cos B = c$ . Since we know that $\angle A + \angle B = 90^\circ$ , we also know that $\cos B = \sin A$ . Thus, $b\cos A + a\sin A = c$ , or $$ \frac{b}{c}\,\cos A + \frac{a}{c}\, \sin A = 1. $$ Since $\frac{b}{c} = \cos A$ and $\frac{a}{c} = \sin A$ , we have $$ \cos^2 A + \sin^2 A = 1. $$","Actually, this is more of a proof for the trigonometric identity, First use right triangle, with angle being the right angle.
