5,Missing term in series expansion,Missing term in series expansion,,"I asked a similar question before, but now I can formulate it more concretely. I am trying to perform an expansion of the function $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{K_2(nx)}{n^2 x^2},$$ for $x \ll 1$. Here, $K_2(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. This series is a result of solving the integral $$f(x) = \frac{1}{3}\int_1^\infty \frac{(t^2-1)^{3/2}}{\mathrm{e}^{xt}-1}\mathrm{d}t.$$ The stated result is $$f(x) \approx \frac{\pi^4}{45 x^4} - \frac{\pi^2}{12 x^2}+\frac{\pi}{6x}-\frac{1}{32}\left(  \frac{3}{2}-2\gamma+2\ln4\pi-\ln x^2\right)+\mathcal{O}(x^2),$$ where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. It agrees numerically with $f(x)$ for small $x$. However, by using the series expansion of the Bessel function $$K_2(nx) = \frac{2}{n^2x^2}-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left[\psi(k+1)+\psi(k+3)-\ln\frac{n^2x^2}{4}\right]\frac{\left(\frac{n^2 x^2}{4}\right)^{k+1}}{k!(k+2)!},$$ with $\psi(x)$ being the digamma function and using the zeta regularization for summation over $n$, I am able to reproduce all the terms except $\frac{\pi}{6x}$. I.e., my result is $$f(x) = \frac{2\zeta(4)}{x^4} - \frac{\zeta(2)}{2x^2} + \frac{1}{8}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \left[\left(\psi(k+1)+\psi(k+3)-\ln\frac{x^2}{4}\right)\zeta(-2k) + 2 \zeta'(-2k)\right]\frac{\left(\frac{x^2}{4}\right)^{k}}{k!(k+2)!}.$$ It seems very strange that the $\frac{\pi}{6x}$ term should appear in the expansion since only even powers of $x$ appear in $K_2(nx)$. But, numerically, it is certainly there. How did I miss it? Edit #1: I just got an idea where the $\frac{\pi}{6x}$ term might come from! Approximating the integral representation of $f(x)$ for $xt \ll 1$ and using the UV regulator $\Lambda$, we have $$f(x) \approx \frac{1}{3} \int_1^\Lambda \frac{(t^2-1)^{3/2}}{xt}\mathrm{d}t \approx \frac{\Lambda^3}{9x} - \frac{\Lambda}{2x} + \frac{\pi}{6x}.$$ OK, so now the question is why doesn't the Bessel series see this term and what to do about it? Edit #2: The missing term might indicate that the zeta regularization isn't used properly. The term $\frac{\pi}{6x}$ appears right in the middle, separating the convergent sums $\zeta(4)$ and $\zeta(2)$ from the (regularized) divergent sums $\zeta(-2k)$ and $\zeta'(-2k)$. So, the missing term may be the price to pay for using the zeta regularization. Unfortunately, I don't know enough math to come to any decisive conclusion. Edit #3: In edit #1 I argued that the missing term $\frac{\pi}{6x}$ comes from expansion of the exponential in the denominator.

This exercise seems difficult. Indeed, here is my start. First, remark that $x_n$ is positive, hence increasing. Therefore, $x_{n+1}-x_n \geqslant \frac{1}{x_n}$ , therefore $x_{n+1}^2-x_n^2 \geqslant 2$ , and we obtain $x_n \geqslant C_1 \sqrt{n}$ . Plugging this bound we obtain similarly that $x_n \leqslant C_2\sqrt{n}$ and finally we have $x_n = O(\sqrt{n})$ which is a good start. Next, we want to prove that $x_n / \sqrt{n}$ indeed converge. In order to do that we juste have to prove that $x_{n+1}^2-x_n^2$ is a convergent sequence which I can not prove. This is equivalent to proving that $\frac{x_n}{\prod_{k=1}^nx_k^{1/n}}$ converge. Here are the details of a further attempt: as we expect $y_n:=x_n/\sqrt{n}$ to converge, we re-write everything in terms of $y_n$ and obtain: $$y_{n+1}^2-y_n^2=-\frac{y_n^2}{n+1} + \frac{2\sqrt{n}y_n}{(n+1)(n!)^{\frac{1}{2n}}\prod y_k^{1/n}}=\frac{y_n}{n+1} \left(\frac{2\sqrt{n}}{(n!)^{\frac{1}{2n}}\prod y_k^{1/n}}-y_n\right)$$ and now, because of Stirling, we expect that $\lim y_n^2 = \lim y_n \prod y_k^{1/n} = 2\sqrt{e}$ , because otherwise, at least if $2\sqrt{e}$ is not a limit value for $y_n^2$ , then we have $y_{n+1}^2 -y_n^2 \geqslant \frac{C}{n+1}$ and then $y_n$ is unbounded, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this proves at least that $2\sqrt{e}$ is a limit value of $y_n^2$ , and it remains to prove that it is the only one. Assuming $y_{\varphi(n)}^2 \to \ell \neq 2\sqrt{e}$ we deduce that $y_{\varphi(n)+1}^2-y_{\varphi(n)}^2 \geqslant \frac{C}{n}$ but from there I am not able to derive any contradiction ...","Let and defind by iteration by Prove that there exists such that .

The sequence above was constructed greedily , i.e., starting with $x_1=1$ and $x_2=3$ we recursively find the smallest $x_{k+1}$ that is $>x_k$ and is either $\ge \frac{2x_k^2}{x_{k-1}}$ or $\le  \frac{x_k^2}{2x_{k-1}}$. Note that being too greedy is bad: Starting with $x_1=1$, $x_2=2$, we arrive at the much worse $1,2,8,9,21,22,47,\ldots, x_{21}=6647$.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory']"

This integral popped up when I was trying to find the average difference of two points on a circle, where these points are assumed to be drawn independently from a von Mises distribution. It was noted by Robert Israel that this integral can be reduced to $$ \int_0^\pi t I_0(2\kappa \cos(t/2)) \; dt = \frac{\pi^2}{2} I_0(\kappa)^2 - 4 \sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{I_{2r+1}(\kappa)^2}{(2r+1)^2} \; .$$ So I was wondering, if we can further simplify  this expression, or to stated more clearly: Is there a closed formula for the following sum of modified Bessel functions of the first kind? $$\sum_{r=0}^\infty \frac{I_{2r+1}(\kappa)^2}{(2r+1)^2}$$ A lot of remarkable identities in terms of infinite sums of Bessel functions are known. E.g. Abramowitz and Stegun list in §9.6.33ff. a few of them, like: $$\begin{align} 1        &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{r}I_{2r}(z) \\ e^z      &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} I_{r}(z) \\ \cosh{z} &= I_0(z) + 2\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} I_{2r}(z) \\ \end{align}$$ WolframResearch lists another bunch of infinite series identities. Also, Neumann's addition theorem seems to work wonders <1> <2> <3> . Regarding the integral itself, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik mention in 6.519.1 that $$\int_0^{\pi/2} J_{2r}(2\kappa\cos{t}) = \frac{\pi}{2} J_r^2(\kappa) \; ,$$ where $J_r(x) = i^rI_r(-ix)$ . So there might be a chance to expect something along this line. Going back to the original problem "" What is the expected value of a distribution $\Delta$ with the following density function "" $$f_{\Delta}(t) := \frac{I_0 \left( 2\kappa \cos{\frac{t}{2}} \right)}{\pi I^2_0(\kappa)} \; ,$$ a straightforward integration leads to the integral mentioned above. Using some probability theory voodoo we can make use of the fact that $$\mathbb{E}[\Delta] = -i \varphi'_{\Delta}(0)  = -i \left[\frac{d}{d\omega}  \mathcal{F}(f_{\Delta})(\omega) \right] \Bigg|_{\omega=0}  = -i \left[\frac{d}{d\omega}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{it\omega}f_{\Delta}(t) dt  \right] \Bigg|_{\omega=0} $$ where $\varphi_{\Delta}$ is the characteristic function of $f_{\Delta}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ the (properly scaled) Fourier transform. Now with $\varphi(-\omega) = \overline{\varphi(\omega)}$ , we could further rewrite $$\mathbb{E}[\Delta] = -i\varphi'_{\Delta}(0)  = \lim_{\omega \rightarrow 0} \frac{\varphi_{\Delta}(\omega) - \varphi_{\Delta}(-\omega)}{2i\omega}  = \lim_{\omega \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mathcal{Im}\left(\varphi_{\Delta}(\omega)\right)}{\omega} \,$$ to (by plugging in the integral representation of $I_0$ ) obtain $$\mathbb{E}[\Delta]  = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{4}{\pi I_0^2(\kappa)} \sum_{r=0}^\infty \left( \frac{I_{2r+1}(\kappa)^2}{2r+1} \right)^2  = \frac{1}{\pi^2 I_0^2{\kappa}} \cdot \lim_{\omega \rightarrow 0} \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{\sin(t\omega)}{\omega} e^{2\kappa\cos{t}\sin{\tau}} d\tau \, dt \; ,$$ but this will essentially lead to the same integral we started with. The promising part about this approach is that the Fourier transform pops up, which might leave some room for the harmonic analysis people among you to do your magic.","I was trying to find a closed form for the integral where are the modified Bessel functions.

It was noted by Robert Israel that this integral can be reduced to So I was wondering, if we can further simplify  this expression, or to stated more clearly: Is there a closed formula for the following sum of modified Bessel functions of the first kind? A lot of remarkable identities in terms of infinite sums of Bessel functions are known. E.g. Abramowitz and Stegun list in §9.6.33ff. a few of them, like: WolframResearch lists another bunch of infinite series identities. Also, Neumann's addition theorem seems to work wonders <1> <2> <3> . Regarding the integral itself, Gradshteyn and Ryzhik mention in 6.519.1 that where . So there might be a chance to expect something along this line. Going back to the original problem "" What is the expected value of a distribution with the following density function "" a straightforward integration leads to the integral mentioned above. Using some probability theory voodoo we can make use of the fact that where is the characteristic function of and the (properly scaled) Fourier transform. Now with , we could further rewrite to (by plugging in the integral representation of ) obtain but this will essentially lead to the same integral we started with.

29,The size of sets of positive integers not having distinct subsets with equal size and sum,The size of sets of positive integers not having distinct subsets with equal size and sum,,"Let us call a set $S$ of positive integers ""good"" if there does not exist a pair of distinct subsets $A,B\subseteq S$ who have equal size and an equal sum. Equivalently, a set $S$ is good if the function $f:P(S)\rightarrow \mathbb N^2$ defined as $$f(A)=\left(|A|,\sum_{a\in A}a\right)$$ is injective. Given any $d$, what is the smallest $n$ such that there exists a subset $S$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ which is good and has $d$ elements? I thought of this problem as a variation on a related one where we drop the requirement that $A$ and $B$ have the same size (i.e. ask that $g(A)=\sum_{a\in A}a$ be injective on the power set of $S$). (This post previously claimed this variant was easy; it has been pointed out in the comments by @Shagnik that it is open ). A potentially useful reformulation of the new problem is that one may also define this as looking for subsets of $\{(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),\ldots,(1,n)\}$ such that no two subsets have equal sum. I can get lower bounds on $n$. In particular, note that a $k$ element subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ must have its sum lie between $1+2+\ldots+k$ and $(n-k+1)+\ldots+n$. In particular, it can take on only $k(n-k)+1$ possible sums. However, there are ${d \choose k}$ subsets of $S$ needing distinct sums. Thus, we get the bound: $${d\choose k}\leq k(n-k)+1.$$ which must hold for all $0\leq k \leq d$. If one sets $k=d/2$ and works through using Stirling's approximation, dropping some lower order terms that crop up, one gets that $n$ should be at least asymptotic to $\frac{2\sqrt{2}\cdot 2^d}{\sqrt{\pi}\cdot d^{3/2}}$. That is, the ratio of $n$ to that expression tends to at least $1$ as $d$ goes to $\infty$. For upper bounds, we can obviously bound that $n\leq 2^{d-1}$ since $\{1,2,\ldots,2^{d-1}\}$ is a good set. However, this still leaves a sizeable gap between upper and lower bounds. I do not know whether it is optimal, but a greedy algorithm where we define a sequence $a_n$ by setting $$a_n=\min\{x:\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n-1},x\}\text{ is good}\}$$ yields a sequence starting as $1,\,2,\,3,\,5,\,8,\,14,\,25,\,45,\,85,\,162,\,310,\,595,\,1165,\,2285,\,4485,\,8808$.

For example, $[2 < 3] = 1; [2 > 3] = 0$ The problem is introduced from a programming problem from URAL . I'm trying to find a closed form solution for the problem (notice that $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ is the number of arrangements of $j$ horses and $k$ students in which the last horse is empty and the adjacent $l$ horses are not all occupied). Here I want to show an algebraic way, to obtain $f_{j,k}^{(l)} = [j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k), \qquad j=l$ which I got through combinatorial interpretation, that I think helpful to solve the recurrence of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$. In fact, $[j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k)$ is the solution to the following recurrence: \begin{align*} g_{1,k} &= \left[k \le 1\right] (1 - k), \qquad k \ge 0 \\ g_{j,k} &= \left[k < j\right] \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0 \end{align*} Notice that the recurrence of $g$ is similiar with that of $f^{(l)}$. It seems to be as strange as the recurrence of $f^{(l)}$, but it isn't too messy. Let's solve it by hand. First assume that \begin{align*} g_{1,k}^* &= 1 - k, \qquad k \ge 0 \\ g_{j,k}^* &= \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0 \end{align*} We have $g_{1,k}^* = g_{1,k}$ for $0 \le k \le 1$. Now let's consider the exponential generating function for $g_{j,k}^*$: $\hat G_j^*(z) = \sum_{k \ge 0} g_{j,k}^* z^k/k!$. \begin{align*} \hat G_1^*(z) &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(1-k)z^k}{k!} \\ &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \left(\frac{z^k}{k!} - \frac{kz^k}{k!}\right) \\ &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^k}{k!} - \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^{k+1}}{k!} \\ &= (1-z)e^z \end{align*} and for $j > 1$, \begin{align*} \hat G_j^*(z) &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \sum_{0 \le t \le k} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^k}{t!(k-t)!} \\ &= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge t} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^{k-t}}{(k-t)!} \\ &= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{g_{j-1,k}^*z^k}{k!} \\ &= e^z \hat G_{j-1}^*(z) \end{align*} so $\hat G_j^*(z) = (1-z)e^{jz}$, and we get $g_{j,k}^* = j^{k-1}(j-k)$, and $g_{k,k}^* = g_{k,k} = 0$ whenever $k \ge 1$. Now it's easy to prove $g_{j,k} = g_{j,k}^*$ for $0 \le k \le j$ by induction on $j$. Can we solve $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ like this? More precisely, extend some zeros of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ to nonzeros to eliminate the awful factor $[j > k + 1]$ in recurrence, solve it and prove that the nonzeros of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ keeps its value when extending? Thanks for your help!","Solve the recurrence \[ f_{j,k}^{(l)} = \begin{cases} \left[j>k\right] j^{k-1}(j-k), &\qquad j=l \\ \\ \left[j>k+1\right] \sum_t \binom k t f_{j-1,k-t}^{(l)}, &\qquad j>l \end{cases} \] for all nonnegative integer $k$ and postive integers $j$, $l$, where \[ [P] = \begin{cases} 1, &\qquad \hbox{if $P$ is true} \\ 0, &\qquad \hbox{otherwise} \end{cases} \] is Iverson bracket, see Wikipedia . For example, $[2 < 3] = 1; [2 > 3] = 0$ The problem is introduced from a programming problem from URAL . I'm trying to find a closed form solution for the problem (notice that $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$ is the number of arrangements of $j$ horses and $k$ students in which the last horse is empty and the adjacent $l$ horses are not all occupied). Here I want to show an algebraic way, to obtain $f_{j,k}^{(l)} = [j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k), \qquad j=l$ which I got through combinatorial interpretation, that I think helpful to solve the recurrence of $f_{j,k}^{(l)}$. In fact, $[j>k] j^{k-1}(j-k)$ is the solution to the following recurrence: \begin{align*} g_{1,k} &= \left[k \le 1\right] (1 - k), \qquad k \ge 0 \\ g_{j,k} &= \left[k < j\right] \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0 \end{align*} Notice that the recurrence of $g$ is similiar with that of $f^{(l)}$. It seems to be as strange as the recurrence of $f^{(l)}$, but it isn't too messy. Let's solve it by hand. First assume that \begin{align*} g_{1,k}^* &= 1 - k, \qquad k \ge 0 \\ g_{j,k}^* &= \sum_t \binom k t g_{j-1,k-t}, \qquad j > 1, k \ge 0 \end{align*} We have $g_{1,k}^* = g_{1,k}$ for $0 \le k \le 1$. Now let's consider the exponential generating function for $g_{j,k}^*$: $\hat G_j^*(z) = \sum_{k \ge 0} g_{j,k}^* z^k/k!$. \begin{align*} \hat G_1^*(z) &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(1-k)z^k}{k!} \\ &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \left(\frac{z^k}{k!} - \frac{kz^k}{k!}\right) \\ &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^k}{k!} - \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{z^{k+1}}{k!} \\ &= (1-z)e^z \end{align*} and for $j > 1$, \begin{align*} \hat G_j^*(z) &= \sum_{k \ge 0} \sum_{0 \le t \le k} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^k}{t!(k-t)!} \\ &= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge t} \frac{g_{j-1,k-t}^*z^{k-t}}{(k-t)!} \\ &= \sum_{t \ge 0} \frac{z^t}{t!} \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{g_{j-1,k}^*z^k}{k!} \\ &= e^z \hat G_{j-1}^*(z) \end{align*} so $\hat G_j^*(z) = (1-z)e^{jz}$, and we get $g_{j,k}^* = j^{k-1}(j-k)$, and $g_{k,k}^* = g_{k,k} = 0$ whenever $k \ge 1$.

35,Binary digital sum (Hamming weight) of Arithmetic Progression,Binary digital sum (Hamming weight) of Arithmetic Progression,,"Context I was recently going through the Putnam 2023 problems and the topic of this post is question $\text{B2}$ from there. For each positive integer $n$ , let $k(n)$ be the number of ones in the binary representation of $(2023\cdot n)$ . What is the minimum value of $k(n)$ ? Now, the given solution takes a brute force approach, showing that $k(n)$ can’t be equal to $1$ or $2$ and then giving example of a case where $k(n)$ equals $3$ . However their approach is not easily generalizable, and I am looking for something better. Problem Given a non-negative integer $x$ , define $C(x)$ to be the binary digital sum of $x$ (the number of ones in the binary representation of $x$ ).

This sequence is reminiscent of the Thue-Morse sequence . While the Thue-Morse sequence takes the current string and adds its complement at the end of the string, in this sequence we have to add the element-wise successor of the string at the end of the current string. It can be easily shown that this corresponds to the idea of binary digital sum. Finally… However, this pattern breaks down as soon as we take the sequence $C(x), C(2x), C(3x), …$ where $x$ isn’t a perfect power of $2$ .

I have a couple of questions related to this theorem: Does this theorem have a special name, or is it just a generic fact? In Corollary 1 (§1170), Euler claims that in case if $\xi\geqslant n-1$ the sum no longer vanishes (i.e. is no longer equal to zero because in this case $\xi$ is out of bounds mentioned in the theorem), but is equal to $\dfrac{1}{N}$ instead. But, due to $N$ not being defined directly in the mentioned corollary, how to understand what $N$ is equal to in $\dfrac{1}{N}$ ? It is known to me that $N=1$ in case $\xi = n-1$ , and that $\dfrac{1}{N}=\sum_{i=1}^na_i$ in case $\xi=n$ . What happens to $N$ in case $\xi\gt n$ ? After more thorough reading, I believe that $N$ might be the real polynomial function in the denominator of a proper rational function $\dfrac{1}{N}$ , according to  Euler's Introductione ad Analysin Infinitorum, Ch. II , §40 (available in English here , see page 41 of this document), which Euler himself seems to be referencing.

The currently accepted answer makes use of Lagrange polynomial , while Euler seems to have a much more basic proof through partial fraction decomposition , which makes the essence of my question different. Case $\xi = n-1$ had been mentioned in this question . The currently accepted answer is based on a polynomial analysis, thus it's also different from what I'm looking for. Finally, $\xi = n$ is mentioned in my other question . I've got an elegant answer based on Vandermonde determinant and polynomial analysis, and it's not too much of what I am looking for.","With distinct numbers , let's denote the products of the differences of each of these numbers with the each of the rest of them by the following principle: There is a theorem that the sum of reciprocals of that resulting sequence will always be equal to : There also is a more general claim that for any integer , (in other words, is a nonnegative integer which is less than the number of factors in each , which happens to be exactly ), the result is just the same: Leonhard Euler provides a very similar theorem in his Institutionum Calculi Integralis, Vol. II , §1169 (available in English here , see page 26 of this document), and the way he proves it seems quite confusing to me.

But, due to not being defined directly in the mentioned corollary, how to understand what is equal to in ? It is known to me that in case , and that in case . What happens to in case ? After more thorough reading, I believe that might be the real polynomial function in the denominator of a proper rational function , according to  Euler's Introductione ad Analysin Infinitorum, Ch. II , §40 (available in English here , see page 41 of this document), which Euler himself seems to be referencing. Can you explain Euler's proof of the theorem in question rigorously, so it's clearly seen what goes from where? Edit: in my search for something to improve the question, I've found some useful references that can help. Case had been reviewed in this question . The currently accepted answer makes use of Lagrange polynomial , while Euler seems to have a much more basic proof through partial fraction decomposition , which makes the essence of my question different. Case had been mentioned in this question . The currently accepted answer is based on a polynomial analysis, thus it's also different from what I'm looking for. Finally, is mentioned in my other question . I've got an elegant answer based on Vandermonde determinant and polynomial analysis, and it's not too much of what I am looking for.","a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \begin{align}

41,Weighted count of Egyptian fraction representations,Weighted count of Egyptian fraction representations,,"This question emerged during an activity I ran for some middle school students a couple weeks ago; basically, it's about a way to ""count"" - with an appropriate kind of weight - the Egyptian fraction representations of a given rational.

There are multiple possible choices of those signs, and I refer to all those expressions as generalized partial sums.

Obviously, this question in each particular case can be solved by brute force, by computing values for all possible $2^n$ choices of signs.

This corresponds to always taking the so-called ""principal square root"" (which is usually denoted just by $\sqrt{}$ ). Similarly, define the optimal arithmetic-geometric mean, $\operatorname{AGO}$ , of $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ for $a\ne 0$ , $b\ne 0$ , $a\ne\pm b$ as follows: $$a_0=a,\, b_0=b,\\ a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},\,b_{n+1}=\pm\sqrt{a_n b_n},\\ \operatorname{AGO}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n,$$ where at each $b$ -iteration, a $+$ or a $-$ sign is chosen such that $|a_n-b_n|\le |a_n+b_n|$ for $n\gt 0$ . If $|a_n-b_n|=|a_n+b_n|$ , there is an ambiguity, so in case that happens, it is also required that $\operatorname{Im}(b_n/a_n)\gt 0$ . Note that the condition which solves the ambiguity if $|a_n-b_n|=|a_n+b_n|$ is either not implemented in the algorithm used in SageMath, or it is implemented but not documented on their official website. Following the terminology of Cox , a pair of sequences $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{b_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is good if $b_{n+1}$ is the right choice for $\pm \sqrt{a_n b_n}$ for all but finitely many $n\ge 0$ . The right choice is exactly what $\operatorname{AGO}$ chooses at each $b$ -iteration. Now define the multivalued arithmetic-geometric mean as $$\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=\lim_{n\to\infty}b_n$$ whenever $\{a_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{b_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ are good sequences. It is a complex multi-function of two variables which has a countable number of values. Let $\mathbb{H}=\{\tau\in\mathbb{C}:\,\operatorname{Im}\tau\gt 0\}$ and $$\theta_3 (\tau ,0)=1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mathrm{q}^{n^2}=p (\tau),$$ $$\theta_4 (\tau ,0)=1+2\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\mathrm{q}^{n^2}=q (\tau)$$ where $\mathrm{q}=e^{\pi i\tau}$ is the elliptic nome. An interesting theorem Cox uses modular functions to prove the following theorem: Let $|a|\ge |b|$ . Then all possible values of $\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)$ are given by $$\frac{1}{\operatorname{AGM}(a,b)}=\frac{d}{\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)}+i\frac{c}{\operatorname{AGO}(a-b,a+b)}$$ where $d$ and $c$ are any relatively prime integers such that $d\equiv 1\pmod 4$ and $c\equiv 0\pmod 4$ . To see the connection between modular functions and $\operatorname{AGM}$ , one can observe that $p^2(2\tau)$ is the arithmetic mean of $p^2(\tau)$ and $q^2(\tau)$ , and that $q(2\tau)$ is the geometric mean of $p(\tau)$ and $q(\tau)$ . Cox's paper explores the connection in greater detail. Question There is a non-empty set in $\mathbb{C}^2$ where $\operatorname{AGP}(a,b)=\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)$ . What is it exactly?

Motivation $\operatorname{AGO}$ has the nice relation to the values of $\operatorname{AGM}$ in the complex plane, which the $\operatorname{AGP}$ seems to be lacking. The ""interesting theorem"" produces a multitude of values and it seems pretty hard to distill $\operatorname{AGP}$ from them. Note also that the homogenity relation $\lambda f(a,b)=f(\lambda a,\lambda b)$ holds for the real arithmetic-geometric mean, but not necessarily for complex $\operatorname{AGP}$ . For example, let $a=-0.95-0.65i$ and $b=0.683+0.747i$ . Then, curiously, $$a\operatorname{AGP}\left(1,\frac{b}{a}\right)=\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)\ne\operatorname{AGP}(a,b).$$ This is caused by the fact that $w\sqrt{z}=\sqrt{w^2z}$ does not hold for some $w,z\in\mathbb{C}$ . There is also a remarkable connection between $\operatorname{AGO}$ and the hypergeometric function which is taken from Fungrim : Let $(a,b)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ and $a/b\notin (-\infty ,0]$ . Then $$\operatorname{AGO}(a,b)=\frac{a+b}{2\,_2\mathrm{F}_1 \left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},1,\left(\frac{a-b}{a+b}\right)^2\right)}.$$ Complex plots Using the color function I made the following plots: The horizontal axis represents $\operatorname{Re}z$ and the vertical axis represents $\operatorname{Im}z$ .

Of course there is a one-to-one mapping: if you know the digits in one system, then compute $Z$ , then compute the digits back into the other system.

By contrast, in the standard binary system, that proportion is 50%. In both systems, successive digits are not auto-correlated (true for the immense majority of numbers, called normal numbers .) Finally, consider the $X_i$ 's as independent random variables with distribution $P(X_i = b) = b, P(X_i = a) =a$ . Remember that $a+b =1$ and $0< a < b < 1$ . Then $Z$ has a uniform distribution on $[\frac{a}{1-a}, \frac{b}{1-b}]$ . If $a+b < 1$ , then the support domain for $Z$ is full of wholes, and $Z$ 's distribution is nowhere differentiable; it does not have a density. Yet it has a distribution and you can compute all its moments. See here for more on this topic. The case $P(X_i = b) = p,P(X_i = a) = 1-p$ , with $p \neq b$ can also lead to a very wild distribution for $Z$ . See chart below, picturing the empirical percentile distribution of $Z$ , if $a=0.4, b=0.6, p =0.8$ . It corresponds to a no-where differentiable distribution. If instead $p=0.6$ , the curve becomes a straight line, corresponding to a uniform distribution. Potential application You can encode a message using the new numeration system proposed here.

The problem is that I have to calculate the series to a high value of $n$ (about 10000, or sometimes even more).

Thank you.","I have the following recurrence relation for some coefficients $$b_{n+2} = \frac{1}{(n+3)(n+2)P_0} \sum_{k=1}^n (n-k+2) (n-k+1) b_k b_{n-k+2}, \quad n>1$$ with $b_1$ to $b_3$ and $P_0$ being the  initial conditions of the series. The problem is that I have to calculate the series to a high value of $n$ (about 10000, or sometimes even more). And since the $n$th term depends on a sum that involves all the other terms before it, the calculation is really slow. So I'm trying to simplify it in some way to make it faster to program. (Getting rid of the sum would be already a good start for example.) The best cases scenario would be to have $b_n = F(n)$, which of course would be simpler to read and way faster to program, but I'm not sure this is possible.

58,The canonical height of a point on an elliptic curve,The canonical height of a point on an elliptic curve,,"I am struggling with exercise 3.3 in Silverman-Tate Rational Points on Elliptic Curves . Here is the paraphrased problem with necessary background: Let $C:y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$ be a nonsingular cubic and let $P=(x,y)\in C(\mathbb{Q})$ be a rational point on the curve. We define the height $h (P)$ of $P$ to be $h (P) = \log\max\left\{ \left\vert m \right\vert , \left\vert n \right\vert \right\}$ where $x = m/n$ is in lowest terms. Prove that the limit $$\hat{h} (P) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{h(2^n P)}{4^n}$$ exists (this is the canonical height of $P$). My attempt is to prove the sequence $a_n = 4^{-n} h(2^n P)$ is Cauchy, so take $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ and WLOG assume $m\leq n$. We proved in the text that for any point $P_0 \in C(\mathbb{Q})$ there exists a constant $\kappa_0 = \kappa_0 (P_0, a, b)$ such that for all points $Q\in C(\mathbb{Q})$ we have a bound $h(Q+P_0) \leq 2 h(Q) + \kappa_0$. Using this idea we can bound the height of $2^n P$ in terms of $2^m P$ by splitting up $2^n P$ as a sum of terms of the form $2^r P$, where $r$ decreases from $n$ to $m$. This introduces new constants $\kappa_r$ but since there are only finitely many of them we can take a maximum and not be too hindered: $$h(2^n P)=h(2^{n-1}P + 2^{n-1} P)\leq 2 h(2^{n-1} P) + \kappa_0 = 2 h(2^{n-2}P + 2^{n-2} P) + \kappa_0$$ $$\leq 4 h(2^{n-2} P) + 2 \kappa_1 + \kappa_0 \leq \dots$$ $$\dots\leq 2^{n-m} h (2^m P) + \sum_{r=0}^{n-m-1} 2^r \kappa_r$$ Set $\kappa^* = \max\left\{\kappa_r : 0\leq r \leq n-m-1\right\}$. (Note that $\kappa^*$ depends on $m$ and $n$.) Then we have $$h (2^n P)\leq 2^{n-m} h(2^m P) + (2^{n-m}-1)\kappa^*$$ Therefore $$ a_n - a_m \leq \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{- n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+\kappa^*)$$ We also proved in the chapter that there exists a constant $\mu=\mu(a,b)$ ( not depending on $P$) such that $h(2 P)\geq 4 h(P) - \mu$. If we then apply this to bound $h(2^n P)$ from below in terms of $h(2^m P)$ and $\mu$, we obtain a similar recurrence as above, which (assuming I have calculated correctly) gives $$h(2^n P)\geq 4^{n-m} h (2^m P) - \frac{4^{n-m}-1}{3} \mu$$ Therefore we have the bounds $$-\frac{4^{-m}-4^{-n}}{3}\mu \leq a_n - a_m \leq \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{ -n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+ \kappa^*)$$ So $$\left\vert a_n - a_m \right\vert \leq \max\left\{ \left\vert \frac{4^{-m}-4^{-n}}{3} \mu \right\vert , \left\vert \frac{2^{-m} - 2^{ -n}}{2^n} (h(2^m P)+ \kappa^*) \right\vert \right\}$$ $$ \leq (4^{-m} - 4^{-n}) \max\left\{ \frac{\left\vert \mu\right\vert }{3} , \left\vert h(2^m P)+ \kappa^* \right\vert \right\}$$ But I don't know where to go from here since I don't know what happens to  $h(2^m P) + \kappa^*$ as $m,n\rightarrow\infty$, because $\kappa^*$ depends on $n$.
