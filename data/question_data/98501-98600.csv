7,Mentally visualizing functions of complex numbers,Mentally visualizing functions of complex numbers,,"I've recently been learning about functions of complex numbers (to complex numbers), and I can't quite fit them into my head. When I think about real functions, I tend to mentally visualize them as some sort of surface (a two dimensional surface, or a three-dimensional one). In this way, I can intuitively understand what it means for a function of 1, 2, or 3 real variables to be continuous or differentiable, and I can also visualize some problematic aspects of a function in order to get a hint about whether or not the function has these qualities. This intuition breaks down when dealing with complex-valued functions, so I can't really make heads or tail of them. Is there a good way of looking at this problem, from an intuitive perspective? Are there ways that you've successfully used in the past, such as in order to personally understand complex functions, or to teach students about them? Since I'm also going to learn about functions of multiple complex variables, can these methods be extended to such functions? To clarify, I am actually looking for such intuitive devices as Einstein's riding a beam of light . Notes This question is not about graphing/plotting/sketching complex functions, nor is it about visualizing functions in general, nor is it about visualizing complex numbers.

Here's what I have so far: By Montel's Theorem, $|f(z)|\le 100$ implies that $\mathscr{F}$ is a normal family of functions. $\mathscr{F}$ is also closed, hence compact, so any sequence in $\mathscr{F}$ contains a subsequence that converges (in $\mathscr{H}(\mathbb{D})$) to a function in $\mathscr{F}$. Suppose that the conclusion is false; for each $n$, choose $f_n\in\mathscr{F}$ such that $f_n$ omits a value with modulus less than $\frac{1}{n}$. Let $f_n\to f\in\mathscr{F}$.

The question is as follows: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and  $$ f_n:X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}\hspace{10pt} n\in \mathbb{N} $$ be a sequence of holomorphic functions which do not take the values 0 and 1. Suppose that there is a point $x_0\in X$ such that the sequence $(f_n(x_0))_n$ converges to $c\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$. Show that there is a subsequence $(f_{n_k})_k$ which converges uniformly on compact subsets of $X$ to a holomorphic function $X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$.

We may assume that $\widetilde{X}$ is not biholomorphic to the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{C}_\infty$, for otherwise $X=\mathbb{C}_\infty$ and so each $f_n$ is a constant function, and then the statement is trivial. Under this assumption, $\widetilde{X}$ is biholomorphic to either $\mathbb{C}$ or to $D$. Fix a point $\widetilde{x}_0\in p^{-1}(x_0)$ and $\widetilde{c}\in q^{-1}(c)$. For each $n$ fix a $y_n\in q^{-1}(f_n(x_0))$, and we may assume for sufficiently large $n$ that these $y_n$ all lie in the same component as $\widetilde{c}$ in the preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ for some evenly covered neighborhood $U$ of $c$. Let $\widetilde{f}_n$ be the unique lift of $f_n\circ p$ such that $\widetilde{f}_n(\widetilde{x}_0)=y_n$, this can be done as $\widetilde{X}$ is simply connected. Then  $$ \lim_n \widetilde{f}_n(\widetilde{x}_0)=\widetilde{c}. $$ Since the codomain of each $\widetilde{f}_n$ is $D$, this sequence is uniformly bounded, and so by Montel's Theorem there is a subsequence $(\widetilde{f}_{n_k})_k$ which converge uniformly on compact subsets to a holomorphic function $\widetilde{f}:\widetilde{X}\to D$. Define a map $f:X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$ by $f(x) = q\circ \widetilde{f}(\widetilde{x})$ for any $\widetilde{x}\in p^{-1}(x)$. Using the fact that the deck group acts transitively on the fibers of a universal covering and that $\widetilde{f}_{n_k}\to \widetilde{f}$ pointwise, we see that this map $f$ is well-defined.
