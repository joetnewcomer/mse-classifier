Performing yet more changes of variables and integrating by parts yields (assuming I didn't screw up somewhere along the way): $$\frac{2}{r}+\frac{2}{r}\int_{\frac{p}{2}}^{\infty}\frac{x\sqrt{x-\frac{p}{2}}}{\left(x^{2}-\Delta^{2}\right)^{3/2}}dx$$ where $\Delta=\frac{i}{2r}\sqrt{4-\cos^{2}\theta}$. This version, Mathematica is able to compute, giving the formula: $$\int_{a}^{\infty}\frac{x\sqrt{x-a}}{\left(x^{2}-b^{2}\right)^{3/2}}dx=\frac{\textrm{sgn}\left(\textrm{arg}\left(-b^{-2}\right)\right)}{\left(a^{2}-b^{2}\right)^{1/4}}K\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{a}{2\sqrt{a^{2}-b^{2}}}\right)$$ where $K$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. However, this formula is only valid for $a,b\in\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $\textrm{Im}\left(a\right)=0$, $\textrm{Re}\left(a\right)>0$, $\textrm{Re}\left(b^{2}\right)<0$, and satisfying either: “$\textrm{Re}\left(a\right)>\textrm{Re}\left(b\right)$ and $a>\textrm{Re}\left(b\right)$” OR “$b\notin\mathbb{R}$”. All of these conditions are satisfied for my integral, except for the $\textrm{Re}\left(a\right)>0$ condition, which makes no sense. $a=\frac{p}{2}=\frac{\textrm{Re}\left(\alpha\right)}{\left|\alpha\right|^{2}}$, and the initial integral is valid even for $\alpha$ with $a\leq0$, as long as $\textrm{Im}\left(\alpha\right)\neq0$. So: any ideas for how to evaluate: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{\left|1+\alpha x^{2}\right|}?$$ Thanks!",,"['integration', 'elliptic-integrals']"

An online calculator gives the following indefinite value: While the definite value is: With the solution, can the answerer also add what came to his mind when he looked at the integral, in the sense of how did he think to approach this problem? There must obviously be some features of this expression that more experienced people can see and hence can guess the method which might work.

On the other hand $48$ terms give $100$ correct digits. The result might be pretty useless for computations, because the terms feature hypergeometric functions, but they are a very special case ( ${_2 F_1} (n,n;2n;x)$ ) and probably have some special properties which could make them easier to evaluate. Have you seen any series like that? Is there a list of series with ${_2 F_1}$ terms which have elementary closed forms? How would you prove this result? Can it lead to any useful or interesting identities? As a more practical question, can we express $a(r,s)$ and $b(r,s)$ in radicals? The way I obtained the series is too long to fully provide here, but I started with a double Frullani integral: $$\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \frac{d x dy}{x y} (e^{-x}-e^{-a x})(e^{-y}-e^{-b y})=\log (a) \log (b)$$ Then used polar substitution $x= \rho \cos \phi$ , $y= \rho \sin \phi$ , integrated w.r.t. $\rho$ , used half-angle tangent substitution, expanded the logarithm and then integrated each term using Appell function which then reduced to hypergeometric function. Update: Using a known transformation, we can write: $${_2 F_1} (2k+1,2k+1;4k+2;x)= \frac{1}{(1-x/2)^{2k+1}} {_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{x^2}{(2-x)^2}\right)$$ Which makes the particular case above more beautiful since both the parameters become rational: $$\color{blue}{\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{1}{3}\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} 3^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (2) \log (3)}$$ In the general case the parameters also become rational: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;u\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} v^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log (a) \log (b)$$ Where: $$u= 1-\frac{16 ab}{(ab+1+a+b)^2} $$ $$v= \frac{1}{2} \frac{ab+1+a+b}{ab+1-a-b} $$ It seems that for $a,b>0$ we have $0<u<1$ and $v>1/2$ which is good for convergence. Update 2: Using Euler integral for the hypergeometric function, and summing the series we obtain another, more simple identity: $$\int_0^1 \text{arctanh} \left(\frac{1}{2v} \sqrt{\frac{x(1-x)}{1-u x}} \right) \frac{dx}{x \sqrt{(1-x)(1-u x)}}=\frac{1}{2} \log (a) \log (b)$$ While the general solution for $a(u,v)$ and $b(u,v)$ eludes me, there's a single parameter case that's easy to express: $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{{_2 F_1} \left(k+\frac12,k+1;2k+\frac32;\frac{1}{p}\right)}{(2k+1)^2 \binom{4k+2}{2k+1} p^{2k+1}}= \frac{1}{4} \log \left(\frac{2 p+\sqrt{8 p+1}+1}{2 (p-1)} \right) \log \left(\frac{2 p+\sqrt{8 p+1}+1}{2 p} \right)$$ $$p>1$$","I was experimenting with Frullani integral again, and obtained a very curious series: Here: For example: What's really amazing is that terms of the series already give correct digits for the right hand side: .

A singular $0$-cube in $A$ is then a function $f : \{0\}\to A$, what amounts to the same thing, a point in $A$. A formal sum of singular $k$-cubes in $A$ multiplied by integers is an $k$-chain, i.e. sums like $$  3c_1 + 2c_2 - 4c_3 $$ for singular $k$-cubes $c_1, c_2, c_3$. These could be defined more formally as ""polynomials"" in the $k$-cubes on $A$, i.e. functions from the $k$-cubes to $\mathbb Z$ for which only finitely many function values are non-zero. By the way these definitions are taken from Spivak, Calculus on Manifolds , page 97 (the more formal one is from an exercise therein). So now my question. As formal sums they do not admit any interpretation behind being merely formal objects with prescribed rules to manipulate them. Now for an $n$-cube (and also an $n$-chain by linear extension) its boundary is defined as such a formal sum of $n-1$-cubes got from this cube by fixing one variable.  Then relations like $\partial^2 = 0$, or extending the integral over $n$-chains lineary from $n$-cubes, all work out fine, and ultimately lead to Stokes theorem. But when I look at the definition, and try to give it some meaning, or picture to have, such a formal sum seems to correspond to an union of sets (i.e. the parts of the boundary) enriched by some notion of orientation (by the sign in the sum) and ""speed of transversal"" (by its magnitude) (Remark: Actually this seems more of a multiset, as different $n$-cubes could share parts as sets). So, it might be possible to interpret these sums pointwise, i.e. for example $2c_1 - c_2$ not as a formal sum, but as the pointwise addition of functions, i.e. $2\cdot c_1(x) - c_2(x)$ for all $x \in [0,1]^k$ if $c_1, c_2$ are singular $k$-cubes. Of course, I mean this addition if we interpret every element of $\mathbb R^n$ as a vector (i.e. a position vector w.r.t. the origin), as a priori points could not be added. Comparing with the picture (I appended one from the above mentioned book) this seems to work fine. So why not use this more concrete definition, but use abstract formal sums?
