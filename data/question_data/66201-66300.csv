In how many ways can 14 balls be selected if at least one ball of each colour must be selected? The above is a sticks-and-stars problem with an upper bound on the number of stars between two sticks.

From this we subtract the illegal cases like the one below: $$**********|*|$$ where the space to the left of the first stick represents red balls. Note that there are 10 stars here, but we clearly have only 9 red balls in our budget.

Find the number of NE lattice paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ that touch the diagonal $y = x$ at least twice (other than at the starting and ending points). Your final answer should not include $\sum$ but may include binomial coefficients. My idea is to take all of the lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ and then subtract off any paths that do not touch the line $y=x$ at all and all of the paths that hit $y=x$ exactly once (other than at the end points). The number of lattice paths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ is $$\binom{2n}{n}$$ We can see that the number of paths that never hit the line $y=x$ are simply the number of Dyck paths with $2n-2$ steps (i.e get rid of the first and last step, and you're left with a paths that are contained in the upper half-place $y \geq x+1$ ). Because we can either start below or above the line $y=x$ and never hit it, we have exactly $$2C_{n-1}$$ paths that never hit the line $y=x$ . To determine the number of paths that hit the line $y=x$ exactly once, we split our path into two. If we reflect the portion of the graph below $y=x$ , we are left with a ballot sequence of length $2n$ . We know that ballot sequences split uniquely into two ballot sequences by removing the first number and the first point at which the partial sum is exactly $0$ . This leave us with two new Dyck paths, one with $2k$ steps and one with $2l$ steps, where $k+l=n-1$ . The number of paths of $2k$ steps is exactly the number of Dyck paths of length $2k$ contained in the upper-half plane $y\geq x+1$ , and he number of paths of $2l$ steps is exactly the number of Dyck paths of length $2l$ contained in the upper-half plane $y\geq x+1$ . This is exactly $$C_{k-1}C_{l-1}$$ If we index over all $k+l=n-1$ , we recover $$\sum_{k+l=n-1}C_{k-1}C_{l-1}$$ This is exactly the recurrence for the Catalan numbers, so by induction we see that $$C_{n-1}=\sum_{k+l=n-1}C_{k-1}C_{l-1}$$ Because we can either start below or above the line $y=x$ and never hit it, we have exactly $$2C_{n-1}$$ paths that hit the line $y=x$ exactly once. Thus, the number of lattice paths from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ that touch the diagonal $y = x$ at least twice (other than at the starting and ending points) is $$\binom{2n}{n}-4C_{n-1}$$ For the simple case $n=3$ , the correct answer should be $8$ , but my formula doesn't yield that.

In a sense, Kuratowski's theorem is weaker than Wagner's theorem: a subdivision can be converted into a minor of the same type by contracting all but one edge in each path formed by the subdivision process, but converting a minor into a subdivision of the same type is not always possible. However, in the case of the two graphs $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$ , it is straightforward to prove that a graph that has at least one of these two graphs as a minor also has at least one of them as a subdivision, so the two theorems are equivalent. Am I crazy, or is the ""In a sense, Kuratowski's theorem is weaker than Wagner's theorem"" assertion completely backwards? Of course, since both theorems are if-and-only-ifs, there are ""two directions"" to each theorem. But in both cases, one direction is more or less trivial: it is obvious that a planar graph cannot have a non-planar minor nor a subdivision of a non-planar graph as a subgraph. The nontrivial direction in either case is to show that if a graph is non-planar then it must have a [ $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ minor] / [subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph]. Since, as the paragraph explains, any subdivision of $H$ as a subgraph can immediately be converted to an $H$ minor by contracting the ""extraneous"" vertices on each edge, it would seem that showing a graph has a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph is strictly harder than showing it has a $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$ minor. Is there some basic logical point I'm getting tripped up by here? At any rate, as the quoted paragraph explains, I'm sure it's not hard to deduce one of these theorems from the other.

In every step we are allowed   to choose two piles, take one token from each of those two piles and add a token to   the third pile. Using these moves, is it possible to end up having only one token? Solution: To the tokens in the first pile we can assign the pair $(0, 1)$ , to the tokens in the second pile the pair $(1, 0)$ and to the tokens in the third pile the pair $(1, 1)$ . Notice that the sum modulo $2$ of any two of these pairs give us the third one. Thus, in every step the sum modulo $2$ of all the assigned pairs is the same. However, the sum of all the assigned pairs in the beginning is $(2n, 2n)$ , which is equal to $(0, 0)$ modulo $2$ .

In every step we are allowed   to choose two piles, take one token from each of those two piles and add a token to   the third pile. Using these moves, is it possible to end up having only one token? Solution: To the tokens in the first pile we can assign the pair , to the tokens in the second pile the pair and to the tokens in the third pile the pair . Notice that the sum modulo of any two of these pairs give us the third one. Thus, in every step the sum modulo of all the assigned pairs is the same. However, the sum of all the assigned pairs in the beginning is , which is equal to modulo . Since this pair was not assigned to any pile, it is not possible to end up with only one token.

70,Bijective Proof Involving the Motzkin Numbers,Bijective Proof Involving the Motzkin Numbers,,"In answering a question involving tree counting, I ran across the Motzkin numbers, which I had never encountered before.  The problem involved counting the number of rooted, ordered trees with $n$ nodes, subject to the condition that no nodes has degree greater than 3.  Basically, I solved the problem by finding a recurrence, computing some terms, and sticking the result in OEIS.  This turned up the Motzkin numbers, except that I had $T_n=M_{n-1}.$  (Now that I think of it, the correspondence would have been perfect if I'd changed to counting trees with $n$ edges.)  Except for the difference in index, the two sequences had the same initial values, and satisfied the same recurrence, so they are identical. Anyway, I see on Wikipedia that one way to define $M_n$ is the Motzkin number for $n$ gives the number of routes on the upper right quadrant of a grid from coordinate $(0, 0)$ to coordinate $(n, 0)$ in $n$ steps if one is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at each step but forbidden from dipping below the $y = 0$ axis. I have been trying to find a bijective proof that the number of such paths equals the number of admissible trees with $n$ edges, but I'm not having any luck.  I can see that going up corresponds to a node with two children, going straight to an node with one child, and going down to a node with no child, but I can't figure out how to make the correspondence in detail. I've drawn the $9$ trees with $4$ edges, and I've been comparing them to the paths pictured on Wikipedia, and I can match up some of them, but not all.  For example, there are only two trees that have two nodes of degree $3$, and there are only two paths shown that go up twice, so the pairs must correspond.  However, the two trees are symmetric, in that they correspond if left and right are interchanged, and I see no such symmetry in the path. I've also thought about traversing the tree by depth-first search say, and somehow encoding the edges as Up, Straight, or Down, but I haven't been able to make that work out. I've tried to find a proof on the Web, but everything I run across seems to be dealing with much more advanced problems.

The basis exchange axiom, used to define matroids from their bases, is self-complementary, so the dual of a matroid is necessarily a matroid. There is also a survey paper by James Oxley, a well-known expert on matroids. In particular, on p. 11 of the paper, Oxley states that the dual of a matroid is itself a matroid, but points us to his book for the proof. I do not have access to the book, and I'm having a hard time seeing why the dual of a matroid satisfies the exchange property in one particular case. Suppose we have a matroid $M=(S, I)$. Suppose we define $I^\prime$ as the set of all $C^\prime \subseteq S$ such that $S-C^\prime$ contains some maximal subset $C \in I$. Now suppose further that we have $A^\prime \in I^\prime$ and $B^\prime \in I^\prime$, with $|A^\prime| < |B^\prime|$, and $S-A^\prime$ contains some maximal subset $A \in I$, and $S-B^\prime$ contains some maximal subset $B \in I$. Now if $B^\prime - A^\prime - A \neq \emptyset$, then it is easy to show that for any $x^\prime \in B^\prime - A^\prime - A$, we have $$ S - (A^\prime \cup \{x^\prime\} ) \supseteq A, $$ resulting in $A^\prime \cup \{x^\prime\} \in I^\prime$, and hence the exchange property is satisfied. Next, if $B^\prime - A^\prime - A = \emptyset$, and $B\cap H=\emptyset$, where $H \equiv (S - B^\prime) - (S - A^\prime - A)$, then it is easy to show that for any $x^\prime \in B^\prime - A^\prime$, we have $$ S - (A^\prime \cup \{x^\prime\} ) \supseteq B, $$ and hence the exchange property is again satisfied. I am stumped regarding the remaining case: if $B^\prime - A^\prime - A = \emptyset$, but $B\cap H \neq \emptyset$. In this case, it seems that for any $x^\prime \in B^\prime - A^\prime$, we are certain that $S - (A^\prime \cup \{x^\prime\} )$ does not contain fully either $A$ or $B$. Hence, we must prove that in this situation, there exists some $x^\prime \in B^\prime - A^\prime$ such that $S - (A^\prime \cup \{x^\prime\} )$ contains some other maximal subset $C \in I$.

96,Construct a large set such that any k+l elements span the vectorspace,Construct a large set such that any k+l elements span the vectorspace,,"Let $\mathbb{F}_q^k$ be a  $k$-dimensional vectorspace over a finite field, and let $l \ge 0$ be an integer. The question is how to construct a (maximally) large set $A \subset \mathbb{F}_q^k$ such that if you pick any $k+l$ distinct elements from $A$, then these points span $\mathbb{F}_q^k$. This question is a more general version of my previous question , which handled the case $l=0$. In more geometric terms the question sounds like this: Construct a large set of points in $\mathbb{P}^{k-1}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that no $k+l$ lie on the same hyperplane. In the answer to my previous question it was pointed out that for the case $l=0$ these objects are called $\mathcal{K}$-arcs and they are well known. I believe for $l>0$ these objects are called $(\mathcal{K},k+l)$-arcs, but I could not find any construction for them.","Let $\mathbb{F}_q^k$ be a  $k$-dimensional vectorspace over a finite field, and let $l \ge 0$ be an integer.
