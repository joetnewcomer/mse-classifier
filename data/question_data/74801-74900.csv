82,Having trouble thinking of homeomorphisms as topological isomorphisms,Having trouble thinking of homeomorphisms as topological isomorphisms,,"In short: I find it intuitive that isomorphic algebraic structures (be it groups, rings, fields, vector spaces,...) have the same algebraic properties. Yet I do not find it as intuitive that two homeomorphic topological spaces have the same properties (insofar as these properties deal exclusively with their topology). Instead I find it intuitive to define a 'topological isomorphism' not as a homeomorphism, but as I have defined it below so as to follow the pattern of defining isomorphisms in algebra. The next section can be skipped; it just serves to explain why I find algebraic isomorphisms intuitive, as opposed to homeomorphisms, as well as to why I think homeomorphisms 'break the pattern' in terms of how isomorphisms are defined in algebra. My concise questions are at the end of the post. As I see it, an group isomorphism $\phi:(G_1,+)\to (G_2,\times)$ is a 'renaming' of the elements of $G_1$ and of its operator: any $x\in G_1$ is renamed to $\phi(x)\in G_2$ , and $+$ is renamed to $\times$ . Under that view "" $x + y = z$ "" says the same as "" $\phi(x)\times\phi(y) = \phi(z)$ "", yet with different symbols. Given two isomorphic groups $(G_1, +)$ and $(G_2, \times)$ it is intuitive to me that any 'group-theoretic' property holds in one group if and only if it holds in the other. A vector space consists of an abelian group of vectors $(V,+_V)$ , a field of scalars $(F,+,\times)$ , and scalar multiplication $(\cdot):F\times V$ . Thus a vector space can be seen as a $6$ -tuple $(V,+_V, F, +, \times, \cdot)$ . I would define a 'vector space isomorphism' between $(V_1,+_{V_1}, F_1, +_1, \times_1, \cdot_1)$ and $(V_2,+_{V_2}, F_2, +_2, \times_2, \cdot_2)$ as a pair $(f,g)$ of bijections $f:V_1\to V_2$ and $g:F_1\to F_2$ that 'preserve vector space operations' i.e. $f(v+_{V_1}u)=f(v)+_{V_2}f(u)$ for any $v,u\in V_1$ . $g(a+_1b)=g(a)+_1g(b)$ for any $a,b\in F_1$ . $g(a\times_1b)=g(a)+_1g(b)$ for any $a,b\in F_1$ . $f(a\cdot_1v)=g(a)\cdot_2 f(v)$ for any $a\in F_1, v\in V_1$ . Essentially I'm saying that $f$ is a bijective linear map, that $g$ is a field isomorphism, and that $f$ and $g$ 'preserve' scalar multiplication i.e. $4)$ holds. A linear map is a specific case of the above. As with groups, it is possible to see $f$ and $g$ as 'renaming' the vectors, scalars, and operations between them. Given two vector spaces and a bijective linear map between them, it is intuitive to me that any 'linear-algebra-theoretic' property holds in one vector space if and only if it holds in the other. That intuition remains with me for all algebraic structures I have studied, however given two topological spaces and a homeomorphism (often called a ""topological isomorphism"") between them, it is not intuitive to me that any property (that deals exclusively with their topology) holds in one space if and only if it holds in the other. The reason being that a homeomorphism does not seek to preserve any operators (unlike group isomorphisms, linear maps, etc). If it was defined so as to preserve 'topological operators' it would -I think- be defined as follows: Definition: given two topological spaces $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ a topological isomorphism $(f,\phi)$ is a pair of bijections $f:X\to Y$ and $\phi:\tau_X\to\tau_Y$ that preserve 'topological operations' i.e. Given $x\in X$ and $A\in \tau_X$ , we have that $x\in A$ if and only if $f(x)\in \phi(X)$ . Given an arbitrary collection $\{A_\alpha\}\subseteq \tau_X$ we have $$\phi\left(\bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha\right) = \bigcup_\alpha \phi(A_\alpha).$$ Given $A,B\in\tau_X$ we have $$\phi\left(A\cap B\right) = \phi(A)\cap \phi(B).$$ The following results are almost immediate. Notably, since $1)$ and $2)$ below deal with concepts which definition does not require us to use "" $\in$ "" (closed sets, basis, countability) their proof requires only the use of $\phi$ . However, since the definition of a Hausdorff space uses the $\in$ operator, the proof of $3)$ below does make use of $f$ , the function which ""translates"" $\in$ from $(X,\tau_X)$ to $(Y,\tau_Y$ ) Theorem: if there is some topological isomorphism $(f,\phi)$ between $(X,\tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ , then $A$ is closed in $\tau_X$ if and only if $f(A^c)$ is closed in $\tau_Y$ . $\tau_X$ is second-countable if and only if so is $\tau_Y$ . $\tau_X$ is Hausdorff if and only if so is $\tau_Y$ . $\ldots$ Why are topological isomorphisms (as I have defined them) not ever used in topology?

83,limit point and isolated point example.,limit point and isolated point example.,,"I'm trying to understand limit point and isolated point conceptually with example. Do you think my approach is correct. Example for limit point: Let's consider an example in the real number line, which is a one-dimensional version of $\mathbb{R}$ . Let's consider the set $E = \{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ . This set includes elements like 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and so on. You can imagine this set as points on the number line that get closer and closer to 0 as n increases. The point $x = 0$ is a limit point (or accumulation point or cluster point) of the set $E$ . Here's why: For every $r > 0$ , no matter how small, we can find a point in $E$ within $r$ of $0$ . For example, if we choose $r = 0.001$ , we can find an $n$ such that $1/n < 0.001$ . Here, if $n > 1000$ , then $1/n < 0.001$ . In other words, the ""ball"" $B_r(0)$ (which in this one-dimensional case is just the interval $(0-r, 0+r)$ ) contains points from $E$ . And we can do this for any $r$ we choose, no matter how small. So there are points in $E$ that are arbitrarily close to $0$ , which is the definition of a limit point. Therefore, $0$ is a limit point of $E$ . Example for Isolated point: Let's say we have the set $E = \{1, 2, 3, 1/n : n \in \mathbb{N}, n > 3\}$ . This set includes elements like 1, 2, 3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, and so on. Now, consider the point $x = 2$ . This point is an isolated point of the set $E$ . Here's why: There exists an $r > 0$ (say, $r = 0.5$ ) such that the ball $B_r(2)$ contains only the point $x = 2$ from the set $E$ . In other words, no other point in $E$ is within $r$ of 2. Remember that in this one-dimensional case, a ""ball"" $B_r(x)$ is just the interval $(x - r, x + r)$ . So $B_{0.5}(2) = (1.5, 2.5)$ , and no other points from $E$ fall within this interval. Therefore, $2$ is an isolated point of $E$ . Furthermore, it's also clear that $2$ is not a limit point of $E$ because there is an open interval around $2$ that contains no points of $E$ other than $2$ itself. Thus, according to the second definition, $2$ is indeed an isolated point of $E$ .","I'm trying to understand limit point and isolated point conceptually with example.

Suppose that for each $x \in A$ there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$ . Show that $A$ is open in $X$ .
