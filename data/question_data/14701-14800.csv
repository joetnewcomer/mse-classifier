1,Closed form for $\int_0^{\pi/2}\arctan\left(\frac12\sin x\right)\mathrm dx$?,Closed form for ?,\int_0^{\pi/2}\arctan\left(\frac12\sin x\right)\mathrm dx,"Is there a closed form for $I=\int_0^{\pi/2}\arctan\left(\frac12\sin x\right)\mathrm dx$ ? Context Earlier I asked ""Find the area of the region enclosed by $\frac{\sin x}{\sin y}=\frac{\sin x+\sin y}{\sin(x+y)}$ and the $x$ -axis"". The answer turned out to be $\frac{\pi^2}{8}$ , but the proof is non-trivial . A natural follow-up question is, what happens if we change all the sines to tangents? So what is the area of the region enclosed by $\frac{\tan x}{\tan y}=\frac{\tan x+\tan y}{\tan (x+y)}$ and the $y$ -axis, from $y=0$ to $y=\frac{\pi}{2}$ ? To make the algebra easier, we swap $x$ and $y$ , and seek the area enclosed by the new graph and the $x$ -axis. Letting $X=\tan x$ and $Y=\tan y$ , we have $X\left(\frac{X+Y}{1-XY}\right)=XY+Y^2$ . Solving the quadratic in $Y$ gives $y=\arctan\left(\frac12\sin 2x\right)$ . So the area is $\int_0^{\pi/2}\arctan\left(\frac12\sin 2x\right)\mathrm dx$ , which equals $\int_0^{\pi/2}\arctan\left(\frac12\sin x\right)\mathrm dx$ due to symmetry. My attempt I found that $\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\arctan(\sin(x))dx=\frac{\pi^2}{8}-\frac{\ln^2(\sqrt{2}-1)}{2}$ . I tried to use this method , but it doesn't seem to work, because in my integral there is a $\frac12$ , which is not equal to its reciprocal.","Is there a closed form for ?

Then $|a-b+c|, |c|, |a+b+c|\leq 1.$ Suppose $|x|\leq 1.$ We need to show that $|ax^2 + bx+c|\leq 5/4.$ Note that since $f$ is convex, on any interval $[s,t]$ , the maximum value of $f(x)$ is attained at either $a$ or $b$ .

15,Finding the triangle with the maximum area with a given perimeter,Finding the triangle with the maximum area with a given perimeter,,"Question: Of all triangles with a given perimeter, find the triangle with the maximum area. Justify your answer. My approach: Let us have any $\Delta ABC$ such that the sides opposite to $A$ is of length $a$ , the side opposite to $B$ is of length b and the side opposite to $C$ is of length $c$ . Now since the perimeter to $\Delta ABC$ is fixed, thus we must have $P=a+b+c$ to be constant. Now fix any side of the triangle, let us fix $BC$ . Therefore $b+c=P-a$ , which implies that $b+c$ is constant. Thus the locus of the point $A$ must be an ellipse having one of it's axis as the side $BC$ . Now let us select any point $A$ on the ellipse and drop a perpendicular to the axis $BC$ . Let it meet the major axis at $P$ . Now let $AP=h$ . Therefore, the area of the $\Delta ABC=\frac{1}{2}.h.BC=\frac{1}{2}.h.a.$ Now since $\frac{1}{2}a$ is constant, implies the area of $\Delta ABC$ can be maximized by maximizing $h$ . Now clearly $h$ attains it's maximum value when it coincides with the other axis of the ellipse under consideration, that is when $AB=AC$ . Thus $\Delta ABC$ must be isosceles with $AB=AC$ to get a maximum value of the area of $\Delta ABC$ . Thus it is clear that the triangle which will have the maximum area must be one of the isosceles triangles $ABC$ having $BC$ as the base. Thus in any such $\Delta ABC$ , we must have $a+b+c=a+2b \hspace{0.2 cm}(\because b=c)=P\implies b=\frac{1}{2}(P-a).$ Thus by Heron's formula we have $$|\Delta ABC|=\sqrt{\frac{P}{2}\left(\frac{P}{2}-a\right)\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)}=\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}.$$ Now to obtain the condition for maximizing $|\Delta ABC|$ we have to check when $\frac{d}{da}\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}=0.$ Now $$\frac{d}{da}\frac{a\sqrt{P}}{4}\sqrt{P-2a}=0\\\iff (P-2a)^{1/2}-a(P-2a)^{-1/2}=0\\\iff P-2a=a\\\iff 3a=P\\\iff a=\frac{P}{3}.$$ Now note that $\frac{d^2}{da^2}|\Delta ABC|<0$ , which implies that $|\Delta ABC|$ attain it's maximum value when $a=\frac{P}{3}.$ This implies that $b=c=\frac{P}{3}$ . Thus we have $a=b=c=\frac{P}{3}$ . Therefore, $|\Delta ABC|$ is maximized if and only if $a=b=c$ , i.e, the triangle is equilateral. Can someone check if this solution is correct or not? And other solutions are welcomed. Please ensure that the solutions are based on geometry and one-variable calculus.

I did some simulations but not sure how to show a proof for this. I wanted to point out that, from simulation, it seems that $\frac{\Gamma((a+1)x)}{\Gamma(x)}$ can be decreasing for values  $x=0$. We can attempt this by showing that the derivative  of a logarithm of $f_a(x)$ is positive. Let \begin{align} g_a(x)= \log (f_a(x)) \end{align} (here log is base e) and the derivative of $g_a(x)$ is given by \begin{align} \frac{d}{dx}  g_a(x)&=  \frac{d}{dx} \left( ax \log(2)+  \log (\Gamma( (a+1)x))- \log (\Gamma( x)) \right)\\ &=a \log(2) + (a+1)\psi((a+1)x)-\psi(x) \end{align}  where $\psi(x)$ is a digamma function. Now it remains to show the following inequality for the difference of digamma functions \begin{align}  (a+1)\psi((a+1)x)-\psi(x) \ge - a \log(2) . \end{align}",,"['calculus', 'gamma-function']"

The characteristic equation of this 2nd order ODE is $$ \lambda^2 + 9\lambda = 0 $$ and its roots are $0$ and $-9$. These are both real and different, so the general solution of the homogenous equation ought to be $$ y = c_1e^{0x} + c_2e^{-9x} $$ which is the same as $$ y = c_1 + c_2e^{-9x} $$ In my table of reasonable guesses for the particular solution of the inhomogenous equation, it says that for output functions of the form $\textrm{sin}(\beta x)$, $\textrm{cos}(\beta x)$, the particular solution will be of the form $$ y_p = A\cdot\textrm{sin}(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) $$ if $i \beta$ is not a root of the characteristic equation, and $$ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $$ if $i \beta$ is a root of the characteristic equation. So, given our output function $6\sin(3x) $, $\beta = 3$, and if we test it, substituting $3i$ in the characteristic equation, we get $$(3i)^2 + 9(3i) = -9 + 27i \neq 0 $$ so it seems clear that $i \beta$ is not a root, and so I expect that the particular solution would be of the form $$ y_p = A\cdot\textrm{sin}(3x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(3x) $$ Except that it's not, and it wasn't until someone told me to try substituting the output function in the ODE that I realized this. Only $ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $ works. Is my formulary wrong, or have I misunderstood something here? Using $ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $ as the reasonable guess, the particular solution turns out to be $-x\cos 3x$.

The calculus text I am now teaching from uses this rule any time an approximation is needed for an integral.  For example, it may give a messy arclength integral and ask for the Simpson's rule approximation using 4 intervals (and thus 5 sample points): $$ \int_a^{a+4h} f(x) dx \simeq \frac{h}{3}\left(f(a)+ 4f(a+h) + 2f(a+2h) + 4f(a+3h)+ f(a+4h)\right).$$ I understand the idea of Simpson's Rule.  If you just sampled three evenly spaced points on a quadratic function, you could compute the integral on that interval with the weighting pattern $(1,4,1)$; this happens to give the right answer for degree 3 polynomials as well.  The $(1,4,2,4,2, \ldots, 4,2,4,1)$ pattern comes from repeating this pattern over every pair of intervals. But I'm not convinced we should always apply this rule any time we cut into $2n$ intervals.  Why not just use throw out the uneven weighting and use a few more sample points?  If the weighting is so helpful, why not use a more complicated weighting (like the various $n$-point rules (Newton-Cotes formulas) described here )?

So I have two main questions-- is Simpson's rule so useful that calculus students should always use it for approximations?
