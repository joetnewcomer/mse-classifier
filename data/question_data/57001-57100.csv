23,Is it possible to use polynomial interpolation to show that $\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}$?,Is it possible to use polynomial interpolation to show that ?,\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!},"Several months ago, I discovered that one can make use a system of linear equations to obtain a polynomial that approaches certain functions . And I know these is the series representation for: $$\displaystyle \cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}$$ So I decided to test this and try to obtain this series with the bakground I learned above. So I did the following: I'd need a systems of equations in the following form: $$\begin{cases}  a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\  a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\ \end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}  a_2 x^2_1+a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\  a_2 x^2_2+a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\  a_2 x^2_3+a_1 x_3+a_0=\cos(x_3) \\ \end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}  a_3 x^3_1+a_2 x_1^2+a_1 x_1+a_0=\cos(x_1) \\  a_3 x^3_2+a_2 x^2_2+a_1 x_2+a_0=\cos(x_2) \\  a_3 x^3_3+a_2 x^2_3+a_1 x_3+a_0=\cos(x_3) \\  a_3 x^3_4+a_2 x^2_4+a_1 x_4+a_0=\cos(x_4)\\ \end{cases}$$ So, find a solution for $a_n$ should give me the coefficients of a polynomial that approaches the $\cos(x)$ at $x_n$. And hence, I did this: $$\begin{cases}  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{2}=0 \\ \end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{16}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{2}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{4}=0 \\  a_0+\frac{3 \pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{9 \pi ^2 a_2}{16}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \end{cases}$$ $$\begin{cases}  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{16}+\frac{\pi ^3 a_3}{64}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\  a_0+\frac{\pi  a_1}{2}+\frac{\pi ^2 a_2}{4}+\frac{\pi ^3 a_3}{8}=0 \\  a_0+\frac{3 \pi  a_1}{4}+\frac{9 \pi ^2 a_2}{16}+\frac{27 \pi ^3 a_3}{64}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\  a_0+\pi  a_1+\pi ^2 a_2+\pi ^3 a_3=-1 \\ \end{cases}$$ And (using Mathematica), I've found the solutions: $$\begin{array}{cc}  a_0= \sqrt{2} & a_1= -\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi } \\ \end{array}$$ $$\begin{array}{ccc}  a_0= \sqrt{2} & a_1= -\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{\pi } & a_2= 0 \\ \end{array}$$ $$\begin{array}{cccc}  a_0= 1 & a_1= \frac{2 \left(8 \sqrt{2}-11\right)}{3 \pi } & a_2= -\frac{16 \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)}{\pi ^2} & a_3= \frac{32 \left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)}{3 \pi ^3} \\ \end{array}$$ My thinking is that as we put more equations in the system for more values of $\cos$, it will give a polynomial that better approaches $\cos$.

In the first case we have a bounded monotone sequence, hence it converges to $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=a^*$, where $-\frac12 \leqslant a^*\leqslant 0$. Taking the limit as $n\to \infty$ of $a_{n+1}-a_n$ we obtain $\frac{a^*}{4}(a^*+1)(a^*-4)=0$. It follows that $a^*\in\{-1,0,4\}\cap\left[-\frac12,0\right]$, so in this case $a^*=0$. To eliminate the second possibility we use $a_0=-\frac12$ to prove by induction that $\left|a_n\right|\leqslant\frac12$ implies $\left|a_{n+1}\right|\leqslant\frac{1}{4\cdot4}\left(3+\frac12\right)=\frac{7}{32}\leqslant\frac12$ and hence $\left|a^*\right|\leqslant \frac12$.
