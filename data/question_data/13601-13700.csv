Nahin's ""Inside Interesting Integrals..."", problem C2.1. His proposed solution includes trigonometric substitution and the use of log-sine integral. However, I think the problem should have an easier solution (without appealing to another complicated integral at least). I have the following trick in mind. Let's introduce the substitution $x=4-z$ $$I=\int_0^4 \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{4x-x^2}}~dx=\int_0^4 \frac{\ln (4-z)}{\sqrt{4z-z^2}}~d(4-z)=\int_0^4 \frac{\ln (4-z)}{\sqrt{4z-z^2}}~dz$$ $$2I=\int_0^4 \frac{\ln (4x-x^2)}{\sqrt{4x-x^2}}~dx$$ $$I=\int_0^4 \frac{\ln \sqrt{4x-x^2}}{\sqrt{4x-x^2}}~dx$$ And here I'm stuck.

But I would be grateful if it's left open at least for several days Edit After many attempts, I conclude that there is no trick to this integral. The reason is: the general form of this integral in not zero, but has the same symmetry properties, as the above case: $$I(a)=\int_0^a \frac{\ln x}{\sqrt{ax-x^2}}~dx=\int_0^a \frac{\ln (a-x)}{\sqrt{ax-x^2}}~dx=\int_0^a \frac{\ln \sqrt{ax-x^2}}{\sqrt{ax-x^2}}~dx \neq 0$$ $$I(4)=0$$ So we will get nothing from symmetry considerations alone.

Is this sufficiently mathematically rigorous? (2) My first attempt looked at the binomial theorem in an effort to get the expression to look something like the general form: $$(a+b)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a^{k} b^{n-k}$$ but it does not quite seem to match, since $k$ would have to be $0$ so that $a$ becomes $= 1$ does not interfere, but then $n-k$ would be $n$ instead.

If someone wants to read all of it and find any little mistakes, then I would greatly appreciate it, as someone who is seeking to expand his complex analysis skills. (Attempt) Let $f(z) = \dfrac{\log(1+z^8)}{z^2(1+z^2)^2}$ . Its pole is $z=i$ with an order of $2$ . Notice $z=0$ is a removable singularity because we can redefine $f(z) = z^6 -2z^8 +3z^{10}-4z^{12}+O\left(z^{13}\right)$ to make it holomorphic at $z=0$ . The branch points of $f(z)$ are obtained by $$1+z^8=0 \implies z = \exp\left(\frac{i\pi}{8}(2n+1)\right)$$ where $n \in \left\{0, 1, \ldots, 7\right\}.$ Also, let $B_n = \exp\left(\dfrac{i\pi}{8}(2n+1)\right)$ . Additionally, $$\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)=\log\left(\prod_{n=0}^{7}\left(z-B_{n}\right)\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{7}\log\left(z-B_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{7}\left(\log\left|z-B_{n}\right|+i\operatorname{arg}\left(z-B_{n}\right)\right).$$ Let $A_n(z) = \operatorname{arg}\left(z-B_{n}\right)$ . For $n \in \left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$ , let $A_n(z) \in \left(\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right),\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)+2\pi\right)$ . For $n \in \left\{4,5,6,7\right\}$ , let $A_n(z) \in \left(\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)-2\pi,\dfrac{\pi}{8}\left(2n+1\right)\right)$ . For convenience, I created this graphic of what the contour looks like. It can also be viewed here . By Cauchy's Residue Theorem, we have $$2\pi i\operatorname{Res}(f(z),z=i) = \left(\int_{-R}^{R}+\sum_{k=1}^{8}\int_{\lambda_k}+\sum_{m=0}^{3}\int_{\gamma_m}+\int_{\Gamma}\right)f\left(z\right)dz.$$ Perhaps I will write an addendum explaining how to show the integrals over $\Gamma$ and $\gamma_m$ , for each $m$ listed in the sum, go to $0$ . This is how to calculate the residue: $$2\pi i\operatorname{Res}\left(\dfrac{\log(1+z^8)}{z^2(1+z^2)^2},z=i\right) = 2\pi i\cdot\frac{1}{\left(2-1\right)!}\lim_{z \to i}\frac{d^{2-1}}{dz^{2-1}}\frac{\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)\left(z-i\right)^{2}}{z^{2}\left(z+i\right)^{2}\left(z-i\right)^{2}} = 2\pi-\frac{3\pi}{2}\ln\left(2\right)$$ after some basic calculus grunt work. This is how to calculate the $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ integrals: $$ \begin{align} & \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\lim_{\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \to \Lambda_0}\lim_{R\to\infty}\left(\int_{\lambda_1}f(z-i\epsilon)d(z-i\epsilon) + \int_{\lambda_2}f(z+i\epsilon)d(z+i\epsilon)\right) \\ =&-\lim_{R\to\infty}\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{Re^{i\pi/8}}\frac{d(z-i\epsilon)}{(z-i\epsilon)^2(1+(z-i\epsilon)^2)^2}\cdot \left(\log|1+(z-i\epsilon)^8|+i\sum_{n=0}^{7}A_n(z-i\epsilon)\right) \\ &+\lim_{R\to\infty}\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{Re^{i\pi/8}}\frac{d(z+i\epsilon)}{(z+i\epsilon)^2(1+(z+i\epsilon)^2)^2}\cdot \left(\log|1+(z+i\epsilon)^8|+i\sum_{n=0}^{7}A_n(z+i\epsilon)\right) \\ =& -2\pi i\int_{e^{i\pi/8}}^{i\infty}\frac{dz}{z^{2}\left(1+z^{2}\right)^{2}} \tag{1}\\ \end{align} $$ where in $(1)$ we used $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}A_0(z-i\epsilon) = \dfrac{\pi}{8}+2\pi$ and $\displaystyle \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}A_0(z+i\epsilon) = \dfrac{\pi}{8}.$ Since $$\int \frac{dz}{z^2(1+z^2)^2} = -\frac{3}{2}\arctan\left(z\right)-\frac{3z^{2}+2}{2z^{3}+2z}+C,$$ we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to get the desired integral over $\Lambda_0$ to be $$-2\pi i\left(e^{-\frac{i\pi}{8}}+\frac{1}{4}\sec\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right)-\frac{3}{2}\arctan\left(e^{-\frac{i\pi}{8}}\right)\right).$$ We can apply this same sort of process for the other $\lambda$ integrals. After a lot of work, combining those contributions ultimately yields $$3\pi\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)-2\pi\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}.$$ Finally, we put everything together: $$2\pi-\frac{3\pi}{2}\ln\left(2\right)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\log\left(1+z^{8}\right)}{z^{2}\left(1+z^{2}\right)^{2}}dz+3\pi\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)-2\pi\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}+0+0+0+0+0.$$ In conclusion, the integral in question equals $$2\pi\left(1+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}\right)-3\pi\left(\ln\left(\sqrt{2}\right)+\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)\right).$$ Any answer/comment shedding some light is appreciated.","(Motivation) Here is an integral I made up for fun: WolframAlpha doesn't seem to come up with a closed form , but I believe it is (Question) Aside from my attempt below, how else could one solve this?

After a lot of work, combining those contributions ultimately yields Finally, we put everything together: In conclusion, the integral in question equals Any answer/comment shedding some light is appreciated.","\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\left(1+x^{8}\right)}{x^{2}\left(1+x^{2}\right)^{2}}dx. 2\pi\left(1+\sqrt{4+2\sqrt{2}}\right)-3\pi\left(\ln\left(\sqrt{2}\right)+\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{2}{7}\sqrt{10+\sqrt{2}}\right)\right). f(z) = \dfrac{\log(1+z^8)}{z^2(1+z^2)^2} z=i 2 z=0 f(z) = z^6 -2z^8 +3z^{10}-4z^{12}+O\left(z^{13}\right) z=0 f(z) 1+z^8=0 \implies z = \exp\left(\frac{i\pi}{8}(2n+1)\right) n \in \left\{0, 1, \ldots, 7\right\}.
