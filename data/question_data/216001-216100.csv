I want to calculate the width at half height from the lowest point of the curve. Note that for some values of $A$, $k$, and $C$ this is not the same as $1/2$ of the maximum value taken by the function.  Instead, you can get those values just by setting $\cos(\theta) = 1$ and $\cos(\theta)=-1$.  Those should be the maximum and minimum values taken on by the function for a given set of parameters.  Then, plugging those in to the main equation and subtracting the min from the max, you get: $(A/2\pi)[e^k-e^{-k}]$, Now I want to get the half height, which is half of the above value, so that's $(A/4\pi)[e^k-e^{-k}]$. So far so good.  Now I want to solve for which $\theta$ the original equation takes those values.  There should be two since this a symmetric function, but I only need one, because I know where the peak is, and also since the function is centered at 0, one should be equivalent the negative of the other.  So I proceeded to solve the equation as so: $(A/2\pi)e^{k\cos(\theta)}=(A/4\pi)[e^k-e^{-k}]$ (the $C$ was dropped because when finding the half-height the $C$ was re-centered to $0$). Solving this for $\theta$ gives: $\theta=\operatorname{acos}(\ln(\sinh(k))/k)$ For large values of $k$ this gives the right answer, as tested against numeric methods.  However, when $k$ becomes small, $\operatorname{acos}()$ becomes imaginary.  I am then unsure of how to retrieve the solution.  It's clear that the solution exists (I can still crawl alongthe contour of the function and numerically find a great approximation).  It's also the case that replacing $\sinh()$ with $\cosh()$ produces a really good approximation, although $\cosh()$ begins to fail to approximate well as $k$ gets larger (again, tested with numerical methods).

I have a simple equation of one unknown, but the unknown occurs twice in different trigonometric functions and I'm not sure how to combine the two. I want to simply solve for $\theta$ in the following equation, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. $a=\tan(\theta) - \frac{b}{\cos^2\theta}$ How can I reduce this into a single expression so that I can solve for $\theta$ given any $a$ and $b$? (I'm only interested in real solutions and, in practice (this is used to calculate the incidence angle for a projectile such that it will pass through a certain point), it should always have a real solution, but an elegant method of checking that it doesn't would not go unappreciated.) Based on Braindead's hint I reduced the equation to: $0=(b-a)+\tan(\theta)+b\tan^2(\theta)$ I can now solve for $\tan(\theta)$ using the quadratic equation, which gets me what I'm after. Is this the solution others were hinting towards? It seems like there would be a way to do it as a single trigonometric operation, but maybe not.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

37,Can an ellipse roll down a tilted sine curve without jumping?,Can an ellipse roll down a tilted sine curve without jumping?,,"Background Assume that we have a solid ellipse with uniform density, and that it rolls along a curve. In the following MO question , I asked along what curve an ellipse rolls down fastest. It was pointed out that one first needs to find any curve the ellipse rolls down from, without losing contact from the curve and jumping up and down. One can consider this as a variation of the classical Brachistochrone problem . Now, it turns out that there are various curves along which an ellipse can roll horizontally . These are described in this video by Morphocular. It turns out that, if one wants to describe the equation of the curve along which an ellipse with width $2a$ and height $2b$ rolls down horizontally with the center as its axle point, the x-coordinate of this equation comes down to an elliptic integral (see 5:04 of the video): $$x = \int \frac{b}{\sqrt{1-\epsilon^{2} \cos^{2}(\theta)}} d \theta \label{1}\tag{1} $$ This is not an easy expression to deal with. However, there is a way out if one chooses the foci as the axle points, instead of the center of the ellipse. Assume that the ellipse has width $1$ and height $\sqrt{2}$ . In this case, we can describe the curve with a simple sine wave, with period $\pi$ and amplitude $1/2$ .

The question is: On what union of intervals $I$ is it true that $$a\sin(f(x))+b\cos(g(x))$$ $$=$$ $$\sqrt{a^2+b^2+2ab\sin(f(x)-g(x))}\sin(\frac{f(x)+g(x)}{2}+\arctan{M})?$$ What is known - I claim - is that for all $x$ $\in$ $ℝ\setminus{I}$ we have: $$a\sin(f(x))+b\cos(g(x))$$ $$=$$ $$-\sqrt{a^2+b^2+2ab\sin(f(x)-g(x))}\sin(\frac{f(x)+g(x)}{2}+\arctan{M})$$ I'm interested in defining the union of intervals $I$ in terms of $a,b,f$ and $g$ In the case of $a$ and $b$ being functions of $x$ , it's worth pointing out that the process of condensing a sum of two terms like $a(x)\sin(f(x))$ and $b(x)\cos(g(x))$ into one term can be iterated in order to consolidate an expression with arbitrarily many sine and cosine terms into one term, by taking two at a time until you end up with only one. The potential to consolidate large expressions of that form in this way provides me the motivation for wanting to know how it works when we have only two terms. An immediate observation that can be made is that trying a calculus-based approach will inevitably result in very large and messy expressions. Here you can see how long and messy of an expression the derivative is. Here (1) in desmos I've set up a way to easily see that on some intervals it would be appropriate to use the positive square root (on these intervals the graphs overlap perfectly) and on every other interval it would instead be appropriate to use the negative square root (on these intervals the graphs do not overlap) Here (2) in desmos I've set up the same thing but with $a$ and $b$ as functions instead of constants Here is the derivation: $$a\sin\left[f\left(x\right)\right]+b\cos\left[g\left(x\right)\right]=a\sin\left(\frac{f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)}{2}+\frac{f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)}{2}\right)+b\cos\left(\frac{f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)}{2}-\frac{f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)}{2}\right)$$ Let $$u=\frac{f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)}{2}$$ $$v=\frac{f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)}{2}$$ With that substitution we then have $$a\sin\left(u+v\right)+b\cos\left(u-v\right)=\left[a\cos\left(v\right)+b\sin\left(v\right)\right]\sin\left(u\right)+\left[a\sin\left(v\right)+b\cos\left(v\right)\right]\cos\left(u\right)$$ Now suppose this can be expressed as $A(x)\sin\left(u+\phi\right)$ . Then we have $$A(x)\sin\left(u+\phi\right)=A(x)\sin\left(u\right)\cos\left(\phi\right)+A(x)\cos\left(u\right)\sin\left(\phi\right)$$ Combining this with the above we have $$A(x)\cos\phi=a\cos (v)+b\sin (v)$$ and $$A(x)\sin\phi=a\sin (v)+b\cos (v)$$ This implies that $$[A(x)]^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+4ab\cdot\sin\left(v\right)\cos\left(v\right)=a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)$$ and $$\tan\phi=\frac{a\sin (v)+b\cos (v)}{a\cos (v)+b\sin (v)}$$ Here's a bit of progress I made. Case 1 This is a special case of case 3 Suppose $a$ and $b$ are constant coefficients and $f(x)=g(x)$ . By testing out all possible combinations of $a,b$ (-,-), (-,+), (+,-), (+,+), you can deduce the following: If a is nonnegative, then $$a\sin(f(x))+b\cos(f(x))=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(f(x)+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a}}))$$ If a is negative, then $$a\sin(f(x))+b\cos(f(x))=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(f(x)+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a}}))$$ Here (3) in desmos I've set up a way to verify that these hold by adjusting the values for $a$ and $b$ and modifying $f(x)$ to be any function of your choosing Case 2 Suppose that $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are $x^\alpha$ and $x^\beta$ respectively and $f(x)=g(x)$ For all $x$ $\in$ $[0,∞)$ we have $$a(x)\sin(f(x))+b(x)\cos(f(x))=\sqrt{(a(x))^2+(b(x))^2}\sin(f(x)+\arctan{(x^{\beta-\alpha}})).$$ Here (4) in desmos I've set up a way to verify that this indeed holds regardless of what values you choose for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and regardless of what function you choose $f$ to be. More does need to be said about this case but for now this is all I've worked out for case 2. Case 3 Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are constant coefficients Let $$u=\frac{f(x)+g(x)}{2}$$ Let $$v=\frac{f(x)-g(x)}{2}$$ Let $$\tan\psi=\frac{a\sin(v)+b\cos(v)}{a\cos(v)+b\sin(v)}$$ Then $$\cos^{2}\left(ψ\right)=\frac{a^{2}\cos^{2}\left(v\right)+ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)+b^{2}\sin^{2}\left(v\right)}{a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)}$$ and $$\sin^{2}\left(ψ\right)=\frac{a^{2}\sin^{2}\left(v\right)+ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)+b^{2}\cos^{2}\left(v\right)}{a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)}$$ We want to express $a\sin\left[f\left(x\right)\right]+b\cos\left[g\left(x\right)\right]$ in the form $A(x)\sin(u+\psi)$ We can see that $A(x)\sin(u+\psi)=A(x)\cos(\psi)\sin(u)+A(x)\sin(\psi)\cos(u)$ Thus, we can observe that we have to carefully choose the appropriate square root of $\cos^{2}\left(ψ\right)$ as well as carefully choose the appropriate square root of $\sin^{2}\left(ψ\right)$ We can rewrite $a\sin\left[f\left(x\right)\right]+b\cos\left[g\left(x\right)\right]$ as $a\sin(u+v)+b\cos(u-v))$ which then becomes $(a\cos(v)+b\sin(v))\sin(u)+(a\sin(v)+b\cos(v))\cos(u)$ Thus, we have $(a\cos(v)+b\sin(v))\sin(u)+(a\sin(v)+b\cos(v))\cos(u)=A(x)\cos(\psi)\sin(u)+A(x)\sin(\psi)\cos(u)$ This gives us the following two facts: $a\cos(v)+b\sin(v)=A(x)\cos(\psi)$ $a\sin(v)+b\cos(v)=A(x)\sin(\psi)$ If $b$ is nonnegative then $a\cos(v)+b\sin(v)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ If $b$ is negative then $a\cos(v)+b\sin(v)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ Here (5) in desmos you can verify this for yourself by adjusting the sliders for $a$ and $b$ If $a$ is nonnegative then $a\sin(v)+b\cos(v)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ If $a$ is negative then $a\sin(v)+b\cos(v)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ Here (6) in desmos you can verify this for yourself by adjusting the sliders for $a$ and $b$ Thus, we have: If $b$ is nonnegative then $A(x)\cos(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ If $b$ is negative then $A(x)\cos(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ If $a$ is nonnegative then $A(x)\sin(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ If $a$ is negative then $A(x)\sin(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ We effectively demonstrated earlier that $$\cos\left(ψ\right)=\frac{±(a\cos\left(v\right)+b\sin\left(v\right))}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)}}$$ and $$\sin\left(ψ\right)=\frac{±(a\sin\left(v\right)+b\cos\left(v\right))}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)}}$$ And we also know that $$A(x)=±\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}+2ab\cdot\sin\left(2v\right)}$$ Subcase A Suppose both $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative constant coefficients Then: $A(x)\cos(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ $A(x)\sin(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ Subcase B Suppose $a$ is a nonnegative constant coefficient and $b$ is a negative constant coefficient Then: $A(x)\cos(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ $A(x)\sin(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ Subcase C Suppose $a$ is a negative constant coefficient and $b$ is a nonnegative constant coefficient Then: $A(x)\cos(\psi)=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ $A(x)\sin(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$ Subcase D Suppose both $a$ and $b$ are negative constant coefficients Then: $A(x)\cos(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{a}{b})})$ $A(x)\sin(\psi)=-\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\sin(v+\arctan{(\frac{b}{a})})$","Let Suppose that either it is the case that and are a pair of single-variable functions of or it is the case that and are a pair of constants. The question is: On what union of intervals is it true that What is known - I claim - is that for all we have: I'm interested in defining the union of intervals in terms of and In the case of and being functions of , it's worth pointing out that the process of condensing a sum of two terms like and into one term can be iterated in order to consolidate an expression with arbitrarily many sine and cosine terms into one term, by taking two at a time until you end up with only one. The potential to consolidate large expressions of that form in this way provides me the motivation for wanting to know how it works when we have only two terms. An immediate observation that can be made is that trying a calculus-based approach will inevitably result in very large and messy expressions. Here you can see how long and messy of an expression the derivative is. Here (1) in desmos I've set up a way to easily see that on some intervals it would be appropriate to use the positive square root (on these intervals the graphs overlap perfectly) and on every other interval it would instead be appropriate to use the negative square root (on these intervals the graphs do not overlap) Here (2) in desmos I've set up the same thing but with and as functions instead of constants Here is the derivation: Let With that substitution we then have Now suppose this can be expressed as . Then we have Combining this with the above we have and This implies that and Here's a bit of progress I made. Case 1 This is a special case of case 3 Suppose and are constant coefficients and .

That amounts to computing the tightest interval containing $$ x\ \mathrm{cos}(\varphi) + y\ \mathrm{sin}(\varphi), \tag{1}$$ where $x$ , $y$ and $\varphi$ are all (real number) intervals. The first approach one might try is to directly use interval arithmetic on (1). However, this leads to poor bounds, e.g. taking $x = [-1,1]$ , $y = [-1,1]$ , $\varphi = [0,2 \pi]$ one gets $$\begin{align} x\ \mathrm{cos}(\varphi) + y\ \mathrm{sin}(\varphi) & = [-1,1] \ \mathrm{cos}([0,2 \pi]) +  [-1,1] \ \mathrm{sin}([0,2 \pi]) \\ &= [-1,1] \cdot [-1,1] + [-1,1] \cdot [-1,1] \\ &= [-2, 2]\end{align}$$ However, this isn't the tighest bound, because $x\ \mathrm{cos}(\varphi) + y\ \mathrm{sin}(\varphi)$ is clearly bounded by $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ ; this observation leads to the tight bound $[-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}]$ in this case. To eliminate the dependency problem with the variable $\varphi$ , we can rewrite the formula so that $\varphi$ only occurs once: $$ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\ \mathrm{cos}\left (\varphi - \mathrm{atan2}(x,y) \right ), \tag{2}$$ where $\mathrm{atan2}$ is the 2-argument arctangent function that gives the polar angle of the given point. (2) computes the optimal bound in the example above. Unfortunately, it can perform worse than (1) when $\varphi$ is a small interval. For example, taking $x = y = [0.9,1.1]$ and $\varphi = [0,0]$ , evaluating (2) with interval arithmetic gives an answer of about $[0.805, 1.204]$ , which is worse than the obvious answer $[0.9,1.1]$ that (1) computes. We've gotten rid of the dependency in $\varphi$ , but now we introduced a dependency problem in the variables $x$ and $y$ . Furthermore, taking the intersection of (1) and (2) doesn't always give tight bounds. For example, take $x = y = [1,2]$ , $\varphi = [0, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ . Evaluating (1) gives $[0,4]$ , (2) gives approximately $[0.63, 2\sqrt{2}]$ , while the actual answer is $[1,2\sqrt{2}]$ . Question: Is there a differentiable expression that can be evaluated using interval arithmetic and computes $ x\ \mathrm{cos}(\varphi) + y\ \mathrm{sin}(\varphi) $ , with a tight bound in all cases? I'm happy to assume that $x > 0$ and $y > 0$ , but $\varphi$ may span several quadrants. Note that I do need an actual formula which I can differentiate, as the problem I'm working on relies on automatic differentiation. That is, in practice, $\varphi$ is not just an interval but is an interval-valued differential, and I don't know how I would evaluate the expression with differentials if we are taking minimums & maximums over a finite set of values.

86,Why is the sine function analytic?,Why is the sine function analytic?,,"$\newcommand{\set}[1]{\{#1\}}$ $\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\|#1\|}$ $\newcommand{\R}{\mathbf R}$ Let me define the sine function in the geometric way. I want to say that the sine of an angle is `perpendicular divided by hypotenuse.' So first let us define what we mean by an angle. Let $C=\set{(x, y)\in \R^2:\ x^2+y^2=1, 0\leq x, y\leq 1}$ be the part of the unit circle in the first quadrant. To each point $p$ of $C$ we will associate a numerical quantity $f(p)$ which we will refer to as the angle corresponding to $p$ . This quantity $f(p)$ is the length of the arc along $C$ joining the points $(1, 0)$ and $p$ . Then $\sin(f(p))$ is declared to be equal to $p_2$ , the $y$ -coordinate of $p_2$ . So we need to recall the notion of length. Given a twice differentiable curve $\gamma:[a, b]\to \R^2$ , we define the length of $\gamma$ as $$ \int_a^b \norm{\gamma'(t)}\ dt $$ Here the norm is the Euclidean norm. Intuitively, this says that the distance travelled by the particle whose position is governed by $\gamma$ is the integral of its speed, which makes a lot of sense. It is important to note that one may re-parametrize $\gamma$ and not alter the length. More precisely, if $\alpha:[c, d] \to [a, b]$ is a diffeomorphism, then $\gamma\circ \alpha$ has the same length as $\gamma$ . Now let us define the notion of angle using this. We define a map $\gamma:[0, 1]\to \R^2$ as $$\gamma(t) = (1-t, \sqrt{1-(1-t)^2})$$ Note that the usual parameterization of the circle comes from trigonometric functions but we cannot use that since those are what we are trying to define here. We declare that the angle associated to a point $p\in C$ as the length of $\gamma:[0, t_0]\to \R^2$ where $t_0\in [0, 1]$ is the unique element such that $\gamma(t_0)=p$ . Let us denote the length of $\gamma:[0, 1]\to \R^2$ as $\pi/2$ . Finally, we define the sine function $\sin:[0, \pi/2]\to \R$ by declaring $\sin(a)$ to be the second coordinate of the point in $C$ whose angle is $a$ . We extend this function to all of $\R$ in the obvious way. It can be showing using geometric arguments that the sine function thus defined is differentiable and its derivative happens to be the cosine function (which we can similarly define as the `base upon hypotenuse' function). The cosine function itself turns out to be differentiable and its derivate is the negative of the sine function. Therefore the sine function is smooth. Question. However, it is not clear to me how to show that the sine function, as defined above, is analytic. Can somebody please help me with this.

97,"Beyond angle trisection: Constructing regular polygons by dividing angles into 5, 7, 11, (et cetera) equal parts","Beyond angle trisection: Constructing regular polygons by dividing angles into 5, 7, 11, (et cetera) equal parts",,"I've read a paper by Andrew Gleason where he was able to come up with a way to construct heptagons and tridecagons using angle trisection to supplement the usual compass and straightedge. This post questions the ability to use angle quintisection (dividing into five) to construct an undecagon (11 sides). Gleason also mentioned that a 19-gon (enneadecagon) requires 2 angle trisections to construct using compass/straightedge/trisector, since $18=2*3^2$ and the 3 is raised to the power of two. My questions are as follows: Given a circle of radius $19-1=18$ , how would one proceed with the construction? I can't seem to follow along with Gleason in his methods and I'm totally lost beyond constructing $\sqrt{19}$ . Could someone help me work out a construction? In addition to compass and straightedge, does this mean: a. A regular 41-gon can be constructed with one angle quintisection? $41-1=2^3*5$ b. A regular 61-gon can be constructed with one angle trisection and one quintisection? $61-1=2^2*3*5$ c. A 101-gon with two quintisections? $101-1=2^2*5^2$ d. A 433-gon with three trisections? $433-1=2^4*3^3$ Quintisection, heptasection, et cetera can be done with an Archimedean spiral. So if the above statements are true, one can construct a regular polygon with any number of sides even without ""cheating"" (using the spiral to construct 360/n). An 89-gon can be constructed using 1 angle undecasection (dividing into 11 equal parts), a 331-gon / 661-gon / 1321-gon can all be constructed with one each of trisection / quintisection / undecasection, et cetera. My goal is to use Gleason's principles to come up with a way to construct a 433-gon using compass, straightedge, and angle trisector. It would be extremely long, but I would like to see it worked out.","I've read a paper by Andrew Gleason where he was able to come up with a way to construct heptagons and tridecagons using angle trisection to supplement the usual compass and straightedge.
