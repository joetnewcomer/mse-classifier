Determine if $f_n \to f$ uniformly. $f_n(x)=e^{-nx^2}$, $x\in \mathbb{R}$. $$f(x)=\lim_{n\to \infty}f_n(x)=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{e^{nx^2}}=    \left\{      \begin{array}{lr}        1, \hspace{8mm} \text{ if } x=0,        \\[1ex]         0, \hspace{8mm}  \text{ otherwise. }  \end{array}    \right.$$ Because each $f_n$ is continuous over our given interval but $f$ is not, then $f_n$ cannot converge uniformly to $f$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$. However, let $|x|\geq 1$. Considering the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of $e^{nx^2}=1+nx^2+...$, we are able to discern that $e^{nx^2}>nx^2$.

I thought of writing the power series representation of $a_n$ using the power series representation of $\ln(1+x)$ with $x=b_n=\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$ we find that  $$a_n=b_n-\frac{1}{2}b_n^2+\frac{1}{3}b_n^3-\frac{1}{4}b_n^4+\cdots$$ Now the seris $\sum b_n$ is convergent by the alternating series test and the other terms are all terms of absolutely convergent series but it is an infinte sum, can I say so ? I mean is the infinite sum of convergent series a convergent series ? Is this correct and is there any other way to do it ?",,['sequences-and-series']

All I did so far was to state the following definitions: If $x_n \to \infty$, then for all $M > 0$, there exists an $n_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge n_1$ implies $x_n > M$. If $x_n \to -\infty$, then for all $N < 0$, there exists an $n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge n_2$ implies $x_n < N$. If $x_ny_n \to L$, where $L \in \mathbb{R}$, then for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $n_3 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \ge n_3$ implies $|x_n y_n-L|<\epsilon$. How can I approach this problem?
