0,Eisenbud Unmixedness Example,Eisenbud Unmixedness Example,,"I am struggling with the following example in Chapter 18 of Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , in which the author uses the unmixedness theorem to show that a genus 1 degree 4 irreducible curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^3_k$ has a homogeneous ideal generated by two quadrics in $S = k[x_0,...,x_n]$. He shows first that there exist linearly independent irreducible quadrics $Q_1$, $Q_2$ such that $(Q_1,Q_2) \subset I$, where $I$ is the homogeneous ideal of $C$. Next he uses irreducibility to assert that $Q_1, Q_2$ form a regular sequence in $S$. I am okay with this part. Now he says that the curve cut out by $Q_1, Q_2$ has degree 4 by Bezout's theorem. I believe I understand this part. The degree of the scheme-theoretic intersection is equal to the product of the degrees (I believe this is what Bezout's theorem says, although I can't find it phrased in these terms), which is 2*2 since we deal with two quadric hypersurfaces. This does not depend on the fact that $Q_1, Q_2$ are a regular sequence. Please correct me if I'm mistaken anywhere here. Now, here is the part I do not understand. ""Since $(Q_1,Q_2)$ is contained in $I$, we must have $(Q_1,Q_2) = I \cap J$ where codim$J > 2$."" Where does this decomposition come from? Finally, he concludes that $J=\emptyset$ since by the Unmixedness Theorem every associated prime of $(Q_1,Q_2)$ has codimension 2. This part again I believe I understand. Can anyone explain the middle part to me? I do not get it at all. Disclaimer: I am not interested in the actual assertion, only the technique of his proof, so while an alternate approach may be edifying, it's not what I'm looking for.","I am struggling with the following example in Chapter 18 of Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , in which the author uses the unmixedness theorem to show that a genus 1 degree 4 irreducible curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^3_k$ has a homogeneous ideal generated by two quadrics in $S = k[x_0,...,x_n]$.

21,Relationship between two distinct notions for divisors on curves,Relationship between two distinct notions for divisors on curves,,"I've seen divisors on curves before, a few years ago in a course in algebraic geometry. Now I've come across them again, but they're somewhat more generalized. I was hoping someone could explain the similarities/differences between the two notions. The first notion (from Algebraic Curves by Fulton) says for any irreducible projective curve $C$, with nonsingular model $X$, a divisor on $X$ is a formal sum $$ D = \sum_{P\in X} n_P P$$ where each $n_P\in \mathbb{Z}$ and all but finitely many are 0. The second notion (from Algebraic Geometry by Milne) says for any normal, irreducible variety $V$, a divisor on $V$ can be written uniquely as a finite (formal) sum $$ D = \sum n_i Z_i,$$ where the $Z_i$ are the irreducible subvarieties of $V$ of codimension 1 (prime divisors). In the generalized case, when $V$ is a curve (i.e., dimension 1) then the $Z_i$ are 0 dimensional, so just points on the curve, and everything seems OK. But then we move on to the degree of a divisor. In Fulton, the degree of a divisor $\sum_{P\in X} n_P P$ is simply the sum of the coefficients, $\sum_{P\in X} n_P$. However, via Example 12.4 in Milne, the definition of a divisor is as follows: Let $C$ be a curve. If $D = \sum n_i P_i$, then the intersection number $$ (D) = \sum n_i[k(P_i):k].$$ By definition, this is the degree of $D$. Now, we don't have any references for my class (as it's all over the place and would require about 10 minimum..), but this is how we defined the degree of a divisor for a curve in class (using the extension of $k(P_i)$ over $k$) and I'm confused. Is this suggesting that, by Fulton's definition, we have $[k(P_i):k] = 1$ for every point? Because if so, it seems silly to even bother putting that in. Now given Milne is actually writing the intersection number, I felt he could just leaving implicit that the $[k(P_i):k]$ are 1. However in class, we simply said a divisor is blah and its degree is blahh using the degree of the extensions, so there must be something non-trivial going on here! Now the only thing I haven't entirely accounted for above, is the fact that in Fulton, a curve over a field $k$ is a set of points in $k^n$, whereas Milne is using algebraic varieties, which I'm not terribly well versed with. However, Milne makes note of the fact that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal ideals of $k[V]$ and one point sets of $V$, so I would expect, for each $P_i$ in Fulton's definition, there is a corresponding maximal ideal, so that a divisor should be identical, except replacing each $P_i$ with the corresponding maximal ideal. Somewhat more troubling, I thought it was obvious at first, and didn't give it a second thought, but in retrospect, what is $[k(P_i):k]$? If $P_i$ is a subvariety of codimension 1, for a curve defined over $k$, then how can this not have to be 1? If nothing else, I'd also appreciate any additional references for these generalized divisors on curves (though I do like Milne's notes!).

We assume $X$ is (locally) noetherian and $\mathscr{F}, \mathscr{G}$ are locally free of finite rank. Now, I claim that $\mathscr{H} = \ker(\mathscr{F} \to \mathscr{G})$ is locally free.

Since $\mathscr{H}_x$ fits into the exact sequence below $$0 \to \mathscr{H}_x \to \mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus n} \to \mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus m} \to 0.$$ Now, since $\mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus n}, \mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus m}$ are projective $\mathcal{O}_x$ -modules, this exact sequence splits so that $\mathscr{H}_x \oplus \mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus m} \cong \mathcal{O}_x^{\oplus n}$ so that $\mathscr{H}_x$ is a direct summand of a free module and hence projective.

50,$27$ lines on a cubic with multiplicity. Contradiction?,lines on a cubic with multiplicity. Contradiction?,27,"A previous poster asked a question whether there are $27$ lines on every cubic surface allowing for multiplicities. I started to think about this and now I am really confused as I have both a proof and a counterexample. First, there are cubic surfaces with infinitely many lines, that is fine, but if there are finitely many lines how many are there ? There is a correspondence (not 1-1) $$\left\{\begin{aligned} &\text{Cubic Surfaces}\\ &\text{ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ }\\ \end{aligned}\right\}\leftrightarrow  \left\{\begin{aligned} &\text{Lines  }\\ &\text{ in $\mathbb{P}^3$  }\\ \end{aligned}\right\}$$ Where each surface corresponds to those lines which line on the surface, and the lines to those surfaces which contain it. This is an irreducible correspondence, the variety on the left is just $\mathbb{P}^{20}$, so it is irreducible with no singular points, the variety on the right is the Plucker quadratic in $\mathbb{P}^5$. Now the general cubic surface corresponds to $27$ lines, and by specialization to any specific surface (which is a simple point in $\mathbb{P}^{20}$) these $27$ lines will specialize and we get $27$ lines counted with multiplicity. (It is a theorem that this is well defined if the point in $\mathbb{P}^{20}$ is simple, which it is.) On the other hand here is my counterexample, (due to van der Waerden) Let  $$f_3(x,y,z)+f_2(x,y,z)=0$$ be a cubic surface in $3$ space (written in affine coordinates), where $f_3$ and $f_2$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $3$ and $2$ respectively. And assume that the surface has a double point at the origin. Then for lines through the origin, $x=ta,y=tb,z=tc$ we must have $$f_3(a,b,c)=0$$ and  $$f_2(a,b,c)=0$$ this is the intersection of a cubic curve and a quadratic curve, so $6$ points in common, which we assume to be distinct. This gives $6$ lines through the origin. For a line not through the origin, take the plane through this line and the origin, it intersects the cubic in the line and another conic which must decompose into two lines, since the origin is a double point. The number of pairs of lines through the origin is $\binom{6}{2}=15$ and this gives $15$ lines not through the origin. Thus $6+15=21$ lines in total. Now if the first argument is correct then there must be some multiplicities in these lines. The lines through the origin are the simple intersections of a cubic and a conic, so cannot be multiple ? And in any case no two of them can be multiple since the plane through then would contain $4$ lines. Further the lines not through the origin cannot be multiple since the plane through them and the origin have three distinct lines. What is the truth here ? How to resolve this conflict ?","A previous poster asked a question whether there are $27$ lines on every cubic surface allowing for multiplicities.

In general I have a good background in algebra and analysis, but only an introductory course in algebraic geometry (varieties and schemes). I also lack a thorough knowledge of geometry, with only a course in manifolds and algebraic topology. My teacher suggested learning Riemann surfaces first, up to the Riemann-Roch theorem, and then building on that. My questions are the following: What are the relevant subjects that I must learn in my first year? (Besides Riemann surfaces, I believe function fields are related.) What are some good books for self-learning in the subject? I found Rick Miranda's book astonishing but a bit slow.

For this, we can define virtual dimension that stable moduli space should have, and at moduli defined at cohomology of this degree we can integrate by taking ""virtual fundamental class"".

Question 1: Let $X$ a Noetherian scheme be regular in codimension 1 (every local ring of dimension $1$ is regular). Then in Ravi FOAG's (Jun 2013 version) he defines the following. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an invertible sheaf, $s$ a rational section. Then $\operatorname{div}(s) := \sum_Y \nu_Y(s) [Y]$ where the sum is over all irreducible codimension $1$ subsets of $X$. What is this $\nu_Y(s)$? Do I simply take any $y\in Y$ and calculate the valuation of $s$ in $\mathcal{O}_{X,y}$? Question 2: Suppose $A$ is a domain and $x \in A$ such that $(x)$ a prime ideal. Then is the divisor $[(x)]$ principal, equal to $\operatorname{div}(x)$?
