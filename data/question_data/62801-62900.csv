2,Card shuffling to Even Decks,Card shuffling to Even Decks,,"I have an interesting math question I've developed while playing cards with my family and wonder if anyone has a way to approach the problem. Say I have n people who each have a deck of cards. Each deck has a different number of cards in it. We are shuffling the cards for a game and in the end we all want to have the same number of cards to shuffle. Each individual can do one of two actions per round of shuffling. They can shuffle their deck, or they can split their deck in half and swap one half of their deck with half of another person's deck. My question is, is there an equation based on n to describe a method of swapping that will eventually give all n players the same amount of cards? Furthermore, how many rounds does it take? (In my mind, I define a round as a period of time where everyone performs one action. A player can only perform one action per round and the round ends when all players have performed one action) To make the problem simpler, you can assume that each individual can only do one action: split their deck and swap with any other player. The problem is trivial when n is a power of 2. For example if we have 2 people, they split their decks, swap, and they have the same number of cards. It takes one round. For 4 people, you split them into 2 groups of 2 people and perform the swap internally in the group. Then you make 2 groups with one person from each group in round one and have them swap. This takes 2 rounds. I would like to see if there is an simple elegant solution when n is not a power of 2. (You can also assume that each deck splits evenly every time, which is a big assumption but should give a good basis for how to solve the problem. A similar problem would be to replace the cards with cups of liquid which gets rid of passing half of cards around.)","I have an interesting math question I've developed while playing cards with my family and wonder if anyone has a way to approach the problem.

Let $X$ consist of all these functions. But the partition number is the number of ways when the balls and the boxes are all identical. To achieve this, we use Burnside’s lemma. Let $S_n \times S_n$ act on $X$ by $\displaystyle{ \left( a , b \right) f = a \circ f \circ b }$ . Then each orbit is a partition. For example, in the case when $n=2$ , $\displaystyle{ \mid X |= 4 }$ and $\displaystyle{ \mid S |= 4 }$ .

All graphs are assumed to be simple (i.e. undirected and contain no loops or double edges) and connected. It is also assumed for the entirety of this question that every graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$ satisfies the property that $\Delta(G):=\sup\{\mathrm{deg}(v):v \in V(G) \}<\infty$ , where $\mathrm{deg}(v)$ denotes the degree of a vertex $v \in V(G)$ . An edge colouring of a graph is called proper if no two adjacent edges are assigned the same colour. Given a graph $G$ , the chromatic index of $G$ , denoted $\chi'(G)$ , is the minimum number of colours required for a proper edge colouring of $G$ . By Vizing's theorem, if $G$ is a finite graph, then either $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)$ or $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)+1$ . Now suppose that $G$ is an infinite graph. By the De Brujin-Erdős theorem, if every finite subgraph of $G$ can be properly edge coloured with $k$ colours, then $G$ can also be properly edge coloured with $k$ colours. Thus, when $G$ is infinite, by combining the theorems of Vizing and De Brujin-Erdős, we also have that $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)$ or $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G) +1$ . For an arbitrary (finite or infinite) graph $G$ , $G$ is called class one if $\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)$ , and is called class two if $\chi'(G)=\Delta(G)+1$ . In the context of my own research, which is studying locally compact groups acting on infinite graphs, one typically wants to study such actions which are 'highly transitive' in some sense. Thus regular infinite graphs arise naturally in this theory, and although it may not be obvious why, proper edge colourings of such graphs also arise naturally in this context. At the time of writing this, I am not aware of any examples of infinite graphs that are class two, and I cannot find much research on the topic that is useful for finding an example of such a graph.
