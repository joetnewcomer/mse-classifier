20,Where does one use holomorphicity in the proof of Goursat's theorem?,Where does one use holomorphicity in the proof of Goursat's theorem?,,"Goursat's theorem: Let $f : U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a function that is holomorphic on the open set $U$. If $T$ is a triangle in $U$ and $\gamma$ is some smooth parametrization of that triangle, then $\int_{\gamma} f = 0$. My question: Is this no longer true if I replace holomorphic with differentiable? The proof I am reading proceeds by dividing $T$ into quarter triangles, and arguing that the integral over $T$ must be bounded above by 4 times the integral of one of the quarter triangles. The argument proceeds by induction to show that this bound forces the integral over $T$ to vanish. There seems to be only one place where the assumption that $f$ is holomorphic is used - namely, we use it to write $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)h + h \phi(h)$, with $h = (z - z_0)$ $\phi(h)$ converging to zero as $h \to 0$. Let $T^n$ be the $nth$ triangle chosen in the typical method of proof. $p^n$ denotes its perimeter, and $d^n$ the diameter. Supposing that $f$ was merely $R^2$ differentiable, I can create a similar expression: $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h) + |h| \phi(h)$, and conclude that $\int_{T^n} f(z) =  \int_{T^n} (f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h)) + \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h))$. I want to claim that  $(f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h))$ has a primitive since it is the sum of a constant function and a linear function (however, I think that the constant part has no primitive, since it is a vector and not scalar, so it is not the derivitive of $""f(z_0) x""$ - this is wrong, see below), so that we are left with $\int_{T^n} f(z) = \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h)) \leq \sup (|h| \phi(h)) p^{(n)}$ ($p^n$ is the perimeter of $T^n$). Since $\sup |h| \phi(h) \leq d^n \sup \phi(h)$, it seems like the same exact proof goes through as in the holomorphic case. Can someone help me find my mistake?","Goursat's theorem: Let $f : U \to \mathbb{C}$ be a function that is holomorphic on the open set $U$. If $T$ is a triangle in $U$ and $\gamma$ is some smooth parametrization of that triangle, then $\int_{\gamma} f = 0$. My question: Is this no longer true if I replace holomorphic with differentiable? The proof I am reading proceeds by dividing $T$ into quarter triangles, and arguing that the integral over $T$ must be bounded above by 4 times the integral of one of the quarter triangles. The argument proceeds by induction to show that this bound forces the integral over $T$ to vanish. There seems to be only one place where the assumption that $f$ is holomorphic is used - namely, we use it to write $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)h + h \phi(h)$, with $h = (z - z_0)$ $\phi(h)$ converging to zero as $h \to 0$. Let $T^n$ be the $nth$ triangle chosen in the typical method of proof. $p^n$ denotes its perimeter, and $d^n$ the diameter. Supposing that $f$ was merely $R^2$ differentiable, I can create a similar expression: $f(z) = f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h) + |h| \phi(h)$, and conclude that $\int_{T^n} f(z) =  \int_{T^n} (f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h)) + \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h))$. I want to claim that  $(f(z_0) + f'(z_0)(h))$ has a primitive since it is the sum of a constant function and a linear function (however, I think that the constant part has no primitive, since it is a vector and not scalar, so it is not the derivitive of $""f(z_0) x""$ - this is wrong, see below), so that we are left with $\int_{T^n} f(z) = \int_{T^n} (|h| \phi(h)) \leq \sup (|h| \phi(h)) p^{(n)}$ ($p^n$ is the perimeter of $T^n$). Since $\sup |h| \phi(h) \leq d^n \sup \phi(h)$, it seems like the same exact proof goes through as in the holomorphic case.

Let denote a bijection from the Cartesian to Polar coordinates, with supplied with the -equivalence, and We can say that such as or One natural definition would be to define the principal square root of as , however, because we introduced , the function depends on the defintion of . Indeed , if we pick , . This is not appropriate as it violates what we build for the principal square root in An interesting choice would be , indeed, the square root image will be in It seems to be what Wolfram adopted... Now, this is where it gets messy for me : if we look back at the defintion of , nothing prevents us to define it as , where we change the bracket of the interval. This change has a significant impact ! If we pick again , the equation used to have a solution, but not anymore when changing the brackets. Similarly, Wolfram return ""no solution exists"" if we type solve sqrt(x)=-i I am trying to get a natural and intuitive definition of the square root in : Wolfram seems to accept one ,  I would agree that the best bijection would be the one with , but I am not sure about the order of the brackets : why did Wolfram choose to reject ?
