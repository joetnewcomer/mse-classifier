30,Why does this nominally divergent limit of an infinite sum of bessel functions converge,Why does this nominally divergent limit of an infinite sum of bessel functions converge,,"The setup isn't important, but in case you're curious, this is a physically relevant thing I'm trying to calculate that should have a finite value. This equation gives the electric field of a small patch of voltage $V$ of length $l$ on the surface of a grounded conducting cylinder of radius $R$ in the center of the cylinder: $$ |\mathbf{E}|=\frac{Vl^2}{2\pi R^3}\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0^+}\sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{\alpha_{1m}\exp\left(-\alpha_{1m}\epsilon\right)}{J_2(\alpha_{1m})}\approx 1.77578 \frac{Vl^2}{2\pi R^3} $$ $J_1$ is the first Bessel function of the first kind, and $\alpha_{1m}$ is it's $m$ 'th zero (not including the one at $x=0$ ).

What I don't understand is why it even has a well defined limit with the limit outside of the sum. For large $m$ , the zeros go toward $\alpha_{1m}\rightarrow (m+1/4)\pi$ . For large inputs $J_2(x)$ asymptotes to: $$ J_2(x)\rightarrow -\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\sqrt\frac{1}{x} $$ So it seems to me that the sum for large $m$ turns into: $$ \sum_{m=N}^\infty m^{3/2} (-1)^m\exp(-m\pi\epsilon) $$ And even if I add even and odd terms together, I should get $$ \sum_{m'=N/2}^\infty m'^{1/2} \exp(-2m'\pi\epsilon) $$ So I think as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, my sum will go to infinity.

Show that there exists a bijection $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}\right| =\infty$ . My ( edited ) approach: For each $k\in\mathbb{N}$ let be $z_k=a_k i + b_k$ . If $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k\right|=\infty$ or $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right|=\infty$ then $$ \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k i + b_k\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k\right|\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k \right|$$ which would imply that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k$ doesn't converge (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). If $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k$ oscillates and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k $ converges and then I will always find a small enough $\epsilon >0$ such that for each index $n_0$ I find a $n$ with $n>n_0$ and $\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k>\epsilon$ . Hence, $$ \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k i + b_k\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} b_k\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n} a_k\right|>\epsilon, $$ which again would imply that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k$ doesn't converge. In both cases we get a contradiction, hence both series must converge. Further, if both limits $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |b_k|$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |a_k|$ exist at the same time then  it follows: $$ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \left|a_k i + b_k\right|\leq\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |a_k i |+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k |= \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |a_k|+\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k|. $$ This would mean that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_k $ converges unconditionally which again is a contradiction. So at least one series must diverge (towards $\infty$ ). WLOG let be $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} |b_k|$ the divergent (towards $\infty$ ) series. We define two sets: $I_-$ which contains all the indices of terms $b_k<0$ and $I_+$ which contains all indices of the terms $b_k\geq 0$ . Now  we consider two real series which are made by indices of $I_+$ and indices of $I_-$ respectively, $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^-$ . If only one of the series diverges then $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k$ diverges which is a contradiction. If both converges then it follows that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} |b_k|$ converges which is also a contradiction. Hence, both series $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ and $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^-$ must diverge (towards $\infty$ ). Let be $\epsilon >0$ arbitrarily chosen. We define a bijection $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}= I_+\cup I_-$ (note that $I_+$ and $I_-$ are clearly a disjoint decomposition of $\mathbb{N}$ ): $$\begin{align*} &\varphi(1)=\min\{k\in I_-\}\\ &\varphi(2)=\min\{k\in I_+\}\\ &\varphi(3)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2)\}\}\\ &\vdots\\ &\varphi(n_0)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2), \varphi(3), \cdots , \varphi(n_0-1)\}\},\\ \end{align*} $$ where we increment $n_0$ until reach $$ \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0}z_{\varphi(k)}\right|= \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} a_{\varphi(k)} i + b_{\varphi(k)}\right|=\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} a_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} b_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n_0} b_{\varphi(k)} \right|>\epsilon. $$ Then we start the procedure again: $$\begin{align*} &\varphi(n_0+1)=\min\{k\in I_-\setminus \{\varphi(1)\}\}\\ &\varphi(n_0+2)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2), \varphi(3), \cdots , \varphi(n_0)\}\}\\ &\varphi(n_0+3)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2), \varphi(3), \cdots , \varphi(n_0)\}, \varphi(n_0+2)\}\\ &\vdots\\ &\varphi(n_1)=\min\{k\in I_+\setminus \{\varphi(2), \varphi(3), \cdots , \varphi(n_0),\varphi(n_0+2),\cdots , \varphi(n_1-1)\}\},\\ \end{align*} $$ until we reach $$ \begin{split} \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n_1}z_{\varphi(k)}\right| &= \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n_1} a_{\varphi(k)} i + b_{\varphi(k)}\right|\\ & =\sqrt{\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n_1} a_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2+\left(\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n_1} b_{\varphi(k)}\right)^2}\geq  \left|\sum\limits_{k=n_0+1}^{n_1} b_{\varphi(k)} \right|>\epsilon. \end{split} $$ The function $\varphi$ is injective because every element of each both sets $I_+$ and $I_-$ is chosen once. If there existed an element $i_-\in I_-$ which would have no preimage under $\varphi$ then by construction of $\varphi$ it must be possible to add infinitely many $i_+\in I_+$ such that $\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_{\varphi(k)} \right|$ will always remain below $\epsilon$ . However, this means that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} b_k^+$ converges which is a contradiction. (The same argument can be used if we assume that there existed an $i_+\in I_+$ which has no preimage). To summarize, we have found a bijection $\varphi$ which rearranges the series $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}$ such that we can push $\left|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} z_{\varphi(k)}\right|$ above any value $M$ .

Here i wil try to prove that $(x_n)$ converges considering all details. So. i would like to have a critical feedback on my proof and would like to know if i missed something or did much more than it should be.. Here $\mathbf{R}^*$ will denote $\mathbf{R}\ \ \not \ \{0\}$ . Consider a function $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ . First, we show that it's defined on $\mathbf{R}$ and then we will show that $f(x)$ is an increasing function on $\mathbf{R}$ . We remark that $f(x)$ is differntiable on $\mathbf{R}^*$ . Let $a \in \mathbf{R}^*$ . By definition of differentiable function the $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$ msut exist: $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt[3]{a^2}}$ and so it exists $\forall a \in \mathbf{R}^*$ as we chose an arbitrary $a$ . So $f(x)$ is differentiable on $\mathbf{R}^*$ and so is continious on $\mathbf{R}^*$ . We show now that $f(x)$ is continious on $0$ . To show that we pass by the definition : $\forall \varepsilon>0 \ \exists \delta>0 \ \forall x \in \mathbf{R}$ : $|x|<\delta \implies |f(x)|=|\sqrt[3]{x}|<\varepsilon$ To satisfy the definition, one can take $\delta=\varepsilon^3$ , so it holds and we can conclude that $f(x)$ is continious on $\mathbf{R}$ . Let $a,b \in \mathbf{R}$ such that $a<b$ . As $f(x)$ is continious on $\mathbf{R}$ we can write: $a<b \iff \sqrt[3]{a}<\sqrt[3]{b} \iff f(a)<f(b)$ As $a,b$ are arbitrary numbers (satisfying $a<b$ ), we can conclude that $f(x)$ is strictly incrasing function. Now, as all preliminary results are proven, we can show that $(x_n)$ is a convergent sequence. For that, we show that $(x_n)$ is monotonic and bounded. $\bullet$ $(x_n)$ is decreasing: Suppose $x_{n+1}<x_n$ . The previous inequality holds for $n=1$ so we can suppose that it works up to a certain $n\in \mathbf{N}^*$ . We show nowthat it holds for $n+1$ : $x_{n+2}<x_{n+1} \iff \sqrt[3]{x_{n+1}+x_n}<\sqrt[3]{x_n+x_{n-1}}$ . But, as $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$ is strictly increasing function and by induction hypothesis $x_{n+1}<x_n$ , we can conclude that $x_{n+2}<x_{n+1}$ and so $x_{n+1}<x_n$ holds $\forall n\in\mathbf{N}^*$ .

We want to show now that t holds for $n+1$ : $x_{n+1}>1 \iff \underbrace{x_{n}}_{>1}+\underbrace{x_{n-1}}_{>1}>1$ which is true, because $(x_n)$ is decreasing.
