6,Finite Unions of Dendrites [closed],Finite Unions of Dendrites [closed],,"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 3 years ago . Improve this question The question is a bit specific, but seems to be the most general question to ask after handling some obvious counterexamples. Initially, I was wondering the following.  Let $X$ be a one-dimensional Peano continuum.  If $X$ , aside from its points whose neighborhoods are arcs, has only finitely many local cut points, can $X$ be written as a finite union of dendrites $D_1, \dots, D_n$ ?  If so, does $n$ depend on $X$ specifically, or just the number/orders of the local cut points? A Peano Continuum is a compact, connected, locally connected metric space.  A Dendrite is a Peano continuum which contains no copies of the circle.  By a local cut point I mean a point $x \in X$ such that $x$ has an open, connected neighborhood $U$ such that $U \setminus x$ is not connected.  By the 'order' of a local cut-point $x$ I mean the maximal number of components it cuts a neighborhood $U$ into as $U \rightarrow x$ . Answer 1: No.  The Sierpinski Carpet is a one-dimensional Peano continuum which contains all one-dimensional, planar continua: It happens to be locally connected with no local cut-points.  In particular, it contains the Cantor Fan, which is just $C \times [0,1] / [\sim]$ where $C$ is the Cantor Set and $\sim$ collapses $C \times \lbrace 0 \rbrace$ to a point.  Its vertex has order the continuum, clearly impossible for a finite union of dendrites (or any subset thereof). A useful concept is hereditarily locally connected (hlc), i.e. every subcontinuum is locally connected.  Such a continuum is also regular (a stronger condition): Every point has a neighborhood base whose elements have finite boundary.  However, it is known that the union of two dendrites need not be hlc; there is a counterexample constructed in Nadler's Continuum Theory. It is also known that the union of rational continua is rational: A rational continuum is one whose points have neighborhood bases with countable boundary.  Dendrites are rational.  Thus ""connected, finite unions of dendrites"" forms a class of curves nicer than rational continua, but either independent of, or weaker than, hlc.  To my knowledge it has not been studied, but such a class sits in a very useful place in the hierarchy of curves. Main question: What continua can be written as the finite union of dendrites?  What hlc (resp. regular) continua cannot be written as the finite union of dendrites? In particular, can anyone give an example of an hlc continuum which can't be written as the union of a finite collection of dendrites?  I tried looking at examples of hlc-but-not regular continua; however, the standard examples I found can be written as the finite union of dendrites.  In each case I was able to construct them as the union of only two dendrites. Examples of continua which can be written as the union of three dendrites, but not two, would be useful.  A trivial example would be three copies of the Cantor Tree identified at the endpoints - visually trivial, I should say, but if someone wants to write the details then go for it.  In a sentence, too many arcs are produced at the Cantor Set for one dendrite to 'seep' into one of the others and pick up some extra space. Q2: Suppose that $X$ is locally cyclically connected (every point is contained in arbitrarily small open neighborhoods $U$ each of whose pair of points is connected by a simple closed curve in $U$ ).  Can $X$ be written as the union of two dendrites?  Three? Q2b: Suppose that $X$ is locally cyclically connected and known to be the finite union of dendrites.  Can it be two?  Three? Q3: Can the Sierpinski Triangle be written as the finite union of dendrites?  How many are required, if so? I made this one a separate question, since it can potentially be solved without any topological sophistication. Sierpinski Triangle as Finite Union of Dendrites It's been solved, now.  It's not possible. Q4: (Stronger than Q2) If $X$ is locally $n$ -connected (every point is contained in arbitrarily small open neighborhoods $U$ each of whose pair of points is connected by $n$ arcs in $U$ intersecting only in their end points), can we bound the necessary number of dendrites?  Is it $n$ (or $n+1$ )? Q5: What continua can be written as the union of two (or finitely many) dendrites each of which intersect at most in a subset of their end points?  This problem has some tangential relevance to conformal welding theory and SLE, so has probably been studied in the geometric function theory literature if it hasn't already been studied back in the early 1900's when curve theory was a hot area. Regarding Q5, I don't think there's anything interesting to ask about dendrites which only intersect in endpoints or vertices.  It seems to be an equivalent question to Q1, as any 'vertex' intersection can be obtained as a regular intersection of two dendrites augmented by small triods attached along arcs where we'd want a vertex.  But this might be different: Q5b: Classify finite Dendrite unions $D = D_1 \cup \cdots \cup D_n$ such that if $x \in D_i \cap D_j$ for $i \neq j$ then $x$ is an endpoint of some $D_k$ .  Here we don't require that $x$ be an endpoint of any other dendrite it belongs to. Q6: What if we restrict how many dendrites can intersect in a single point to 2?  Or $k < n$ ?  What if we require any intersection point to belong to at least three (or $k$ ) dendrites?  This second part has some problems with (local) duplicates to iron out to get an interesting question, probably. Q7: Anything nice happen if you restrict to continua in the plane?

If $|f(x)|<\epsilon$, then $|f(x)-f_\epsilon(x)| = |f(x)|<\epsilon$. If $|f(x)|\geq \epsilon$ then $|f(x)-f_\epsilon(x)| = \epsilon\left|\frac{f(x)}{|f(x)|}\right| = \epsilon$, hence $\|f-f_\epsilon\|_\infty\leq \epsilon$. 2) $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}$ is compact: Since $f\in C_0(X)$, there is compact $A\subset X$ with $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ if $x\notin A$, therefore $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}\subseteq A$ and $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}$ is a closed subset of a compact set and therefore compact.","Usually one employs Urysohn's Lemma to proof the above identity.

If this really would be correct, I wonder why this simple and more general proof isn't the one one usually sees. Edit: As requested, more details: 1) $f_\epsilon\to f$ uniformly: Let $x\in X$. If $|f(x)|<\epsilon$, then $|f(x)-f_\epsilon(x)| = |f(x)|<\epsilon$. If $|f(x)|\geq \epsilon$ then $|f(x)-f_\epsilon(x)| = \epsilon\left|\frac{f(x)}{|f(x)|}\right| = \epsilon$, hence $\|f-f_\epsilon\|_\infty\leq \epsilon$. 2) $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}$ is compact: Since $f\in C_0(X)$, there is compact $A\subset X$ with $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ if $x\notin A$, therefore $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}\subseteq A$ and $\{|f|\geq \epsilon\}$ is a closed subset of a compact set and therefore compact.",,"['general-topology', 'continuity']"

I have been looking more at glueing schemes, and particularly relative glueing to construct the projective bundle over a scheme and I really want to understand what is going on in terms of colimits in the category of schemes. I am hoping to break this into two questions since it will be a lot to include in just one. First let's say I just have a pair of topological spaces, $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ with $U_{1} \subseteq X$ and $U_{2} \subseteq X$ open sets with a homeomorphism  $$ \phi: U_{1} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} U_{2} $$ Now say I want to glue $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ along the homeomorphism $\phi$. As a set, this is not hard to write down just as a disjoint union modulo the relation $p \sim \phi(p)$. But what is actually going on here categorically? If there is no gluing involved, then we just have the categorical sum,  $$ X = X_{1} \sqcup X_{2}. $$ This has the universal property that to give a morphism from $X$ is precisely to give a morphism from $X_{1}$ and a morphism from $X_{2}$. As someone brand new to the idea of a functor of points, can $X$ then be seen as a representing object for some functor of points? When we try to incorporate glueing along $\phi$ is when I get more confused. In some sense, I need a colimit that captures the notion: To give a morphism from $X$ to some $Y$ is precisely to give morphisms $\psi_{1}: X_{1} \rightarrow Y$ and $\psi_{2}: X_{2} \rightarrow Y$ so that $\psi_{1} = \psi_{2} \circ \phi$ on $U$. I suspect that this is somehow a coequalizer, but I haven't been able to formulate it. So what diagram should I take so that $X_{1} \sqcup X_{2} / \sim$ is the colimit object? This seems to be complicated even further if I have more than two objects to glue. Say I have a family $\{ X_{i} \}_{i \in I}$ with open subsets $U_{ij} \subseteq X_{i}$ along with homeomorphisms  $$\phi_{ij}: U_{ij} \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} U_{ji}  $$ satisfying the appropriate cocycle condition. Can the resulting space formed from gluing be realized as a colimit of some diagram? Is there some generalization of a coequalizer? And again, can this be realized as the representing object of some functor of points? Is there any reference either in the category theory or the topology literature that treats gluing explicitly in this way?

In what follows I will take closure under (relative) complementation for granted, simply because almost all set systems which I know of (besides $\pi$ systems) have this property, its motivation is obvious, and because it is involutory it is easily added to the axioms of a set system without changing the included sets very much. Most spaces which are commonly studied have at most the continuity of the continuum (not that there aren't counterexamples, but at least I don't run into them in my work). Thus, it seems we could have at most the following types of set systems for a space which has at most the cardinality of the continuum. $\underset{f}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$ (Boolean) algebra $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/$\underset{c}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ (slightly stronger than a $\lambda$ system) $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$ $\sigma-$algebra $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$  ?????

For example, all truth functions are well-defined given a Boolean algebra, as is propositional logic. The motivation for a $\sigma-$algebra is also fairly clear to me -- it is essentially the ""countable closure/extension"" of a regular algebra, and this property allows us to define countably additive set functions, and along with that obtain closure under pointwise limits of functions as well as the monotone convergence theorem, the two foundations on which integration theory is based. It is also clear that such additivity could not be extended to the cardinality of the continuum, since the uncountable sum of any non-zero numbers is infinite. But why do open/closed set systems turn out to be useful? How are these uncountable axioms applied fruitfully in topology? As far as I am aware, for example with stochastic processes, we usually rely on some separability/first/second-countability properties in order to be able to apply most topologies fruitfully -- i.e. some reduction of the ""uncountable"" axiom to an essentially countable property. So why not study only metric spaces? Moreover, the study of limits is only defined/sensible once we have the T1 and T2 separation axioms, so the claim that we study set systems of type 5. in order to study limits seems unjustified to me; at the very least we need that in combination with some separation axioms. Also, why do we study set systems of type 5., but not of types 4. or 6.? What is the essential property that type 5. set systems capture (in the way that type 1. and type 3. systems capture)? The best discussion of this topic which I have found so far: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19152/why-is-a-topology-made-up-of-open-sets I agree with the OP of that question however, that the top-voted answer is more of a justification for the notion of metric space (which are always separable in some sense due to the density of the rationals in the reals). The discussion of how notions of limit really seem to be more of a consequence of a notion of ""Hausdorfness"" is here: Why not just study the consequences of Hausdorff axiom? What do statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open,"" gain us? I would also like to point out that the axiomatization of topology in terms of neighborhood systems, plus the Hausdorff axiom, seems to be more relevant to understanding the concept of ""limit"" than the axioms of a general topological space. And again, I don't see why we would need uncountably many neighborhoods of a given point to define it as the limit of something, since countably many neighborhoods always suffices (at least in the metric space setting). Motivation: The motivation for this question came from some rumination about stochastic processes. Namely, the reason why their study can be so difficult is that we are confined to using set systems of type 3., which are only countably closed, whereas we are studying uncountably many random variables. In order to get any degree of meaningful results, we therefore rely on having some degree of ""separability/regularity"" properties that essentially allow us to reduce to the countable case where it counts (for instance with regards to the existence of regular conditional distributions). So as frustrating as it may be trying to study uncountable objects with set systems of type 3., it is clear to me why we can not replace such set systems with any of type 4, 5, or 6, again so that integration and probability are tractable. So then I thought ""oh so we must use topologies because we need uncountability for some reason"". But then I thought about how almost all topologies which I am aware of/use are in some way ""separable"" or ""first/second-countable"", which basically constitutes reducing back to the countable case, the same way we do with stochastic processes. I.e. there is no fundamental gain in generality, since the only cases of uncountable objects we can/do study are those special cases which can be reduced back to the countable case in some meaningful way. I'm really at a loss as to why an uncountable closure axiom would be at all useful, and why we would want only finite closure for the complementary operation, rather than some type of infinite closure. I feel like it has to have something to do with the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" spaces, which leads us back again to the study of stochastic processes, and the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" time. Namely, for a set with countable cardinality, like the natural numbers, the power set coincides with the reasonable choices for sigma algebra and topology. In other words, both concepts are clearly only needed when moving to the uncountable case, where they don't necessarily coincide with the power set, i.e. we can gain a concept of ""continuousness"", rather than the ""discreteness"" which we are necessarily confined to with set systems of countable sets.

I have tried so far to assume that $h^{-1}(w)= (\tilde{y}, w-\tilde{y})$ for some $y_{min}\neq \tilde{y} \in Y$ and either show that $\tilde{y}$ is another closest point, since I show uniqueness only later, or assumed that $\tilde{y}$ is not a closest point and find a contradiction to $h^{-1}$ being a diffeomorphism on $Y^\epsilon$, but neither has been successful so far.

I should probably also assume that $\pi$ is a quotient map, in the topological sense, but let's leave this assumption out for now. Now, suppose that there exists a homomorphism  $$r : B \to A$$ such that $r \circ \iota = \mathrm{id}_A$. Then, $b \mapsto (r(b), \pi(b))$ is a continuous, bijective homomorphism $B \to A \times C$. In reasonable situations, one expects  the inverse map $A \times C \to B$ to be continuous so  that $B \cong A \times C$ as topological groups. Let us say that the sequence is topologically split if this holds. If the sequence, is topologically split, then there is a continuous homomorphism $s :C \to B$ such that $\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}_C$. So, clearly a necessary condition for the sequence to be topologically split is $\mathbf{(*)}$ There exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $1$ in $C$ and a continuous function  $s: U \to B$ (not assumed compatible with multiplicaiton!) with $s(1) = 1$ such that $\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}_U$. On the other hand, if $(*)$ holds, then $B$ is topologically split. Indeed, it suffices to check continuity of the inverse mapping $A \times C \to B$ on the neighbourhood $A \times U$ of $(1,1) \in A \times C$ and, in that neighbourhood, the inverse is given by the formula $(a,c) \mapsto \iota(a) s(c) \iota(r(s(c)))^{-1}$, whence is continuous. So, we have Proposition: Consider an exact sequence of locally compact groups $1 \to A \overset{\iota}{\to} B \overset{\pi}{\to} C \to 1$ and suppose there is a (continuous) homomorphism $r : B \to A$ with $r \circ \iota = \mathrm{id}_A$. Then, the sequence is topologically split if and only if $(*)$ holds i.e. if and only if $\pi$ admits a continuous section, defined on a neighbourhood of $1 \in C$. My question is as follows: Question: Can someone think of an example where there is a continuous, retracting morphism $r : B \to A$, but the sequence is not topologically split? Equivalently, by the above proposition, we need to take an example where $B$ is a not a locally trivial $A$-bundle over $C$. There are easy examples of this phenomenon: Take $A = \{\pm 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the infinite product of 2-element groups (a Cantor set); $B = C =\mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N}$, the infinite product of the circle group; $\iota$ the evident inclusionl and $\pi$ the entrywise squaring map. This gives a short exact sequence $$1 \to  \{\pm 1\}^\mathbb{N} \overset{\iota}{\to} \mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N} \overset{(z_i) \mapsto (z_i^2)}{\to} \mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N} \to 1$$ where $B$ is not an $A$-bundle over $C$, because $A$ is not locally-connected, and $B$ is. This example does not help with the question, because there is not retraction $B \to A$, but it does show that the condition $(*)$ is not automatic.

It is this. Let $X$ be a be compact Hausdorff space and let {$U_\alpha$}$_{\alpha \in A}$ be an open cover of $X$. Show that there exist a finite number of continuous valued functions $h_1, . . ., h_2$ on $X$ with the following properties: (a) $0\leq h_j \leq1$, $1\leq j \leq m$, (b) $\Sigma h_{j} = 1$ (c) For each $1\leq j \leq m$, there is an index $\alpha_{j}$ s.t. the closure of the set {$x : h_{j}(x) > 0$} is contained in $U_{\alpha_{j}}$ So I know by a theorem in the book that compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. I took a point $x\in X$ and noted that the {$x$} is closed since the space is Hausdorff. By definition of open cover, $\exists$ some $U_{\alpha}$ in the open cover s.t. $x\in U_{\alpha}$. The complement, $X-U_{\alpha}$ is closed. Further by normality, $\exists$ open sets $V,W$ s.t $V \cap W=\emptyset$ and s.t. {$x$}$\subseteq V$ and {$X-U_{\alpha}$}$\subseteq W$. $W$ is open hence $X-W$ is closed.

Thanks again.","I'm working on this proof in Gamelin ""Introduction to Topology"" and I think I'm almost at the result, I'm just a little stuck with how to proceed. It is this. Let $X$ be a be compact Hausdorff space and let {$U_\alpha$}$_{\alpha \in A}$ be an open cover of $X$. Show that there exist a finite number of continuous valued functions $h_1, . . ., h_2$ on $X$ with the following properties: (a) $0\leq h_j \leq1$, $1\leq j \leq m$, (b) $\Sigma h_{j} = 1$ (c) For each $1\leq j \leq m$, there is an index $\alpha_{j}$ s.t. the closure of the set {$x : h_{j}(x) > 0$} is contained in $U_{\alpha_{j}}$ So I know by a theorem in the book that compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. I took a point $x\in X$ and noted that the {$x$} is closed since the space is Hausdorff. By definition of open cover, $\exists$ some $U_{\alpha}$ in the open cover s.t. $x\in U_{\alpha}$. The complement, $X-U_{\alpha}$ is closed. Further by normality, $\exists$ open sets $V,W$ s.t $V \cap W=\emptyset$ and s.t. {$x$}$\subseteq V$ and {$X-U_{\alpha}$}$\subseteq W$. $W$ is open hence $X-W$ is closed. Further $U_{\alpha}\subseteq X-W$ and $V\subseteq U_{\alpha} \subseteq X-W$. $\overline{V}$ is the smalest closed set containing V hence $\overline{V}\subseteq \overline{U_{\alpha}} \subseteq {X-W}$.

45,Finding points where a smooth map between differential manifolds is or is not an immersion.,Finding points where a smooth map between differential manifolds is or is not an immersion.,,"I am having trouble answering questions pertaining to immersions on smooth manifolds.  For example:  Given the unit sphere $S^2$ around the origin in $R^3$ and the map $f: S^2 \rightarrow R^3$ given by $f(x,y,z) =(yz,zx,xy), show f fails to be an immersion at 6 points. I am working on problems from a qualifying exam in topology and I am looking for a generic way to approach these types of problems. My ideas so far: I know that an immersion at a point x in $S^2$ means that the derivative map $df_x$ is injective from the tangent space at that point in $S^2$ to the tangent space of f(x) in $R^3$. 1)  Use stereographic projection and then consider the composition with this map giving us a map from $R^2$ to $R^3$.  This approach seems to be really ugly sometimes and if I replace $S^2$ with a hyperboloid or some other surface I may not have a map like stereographic projection. 2)  Consider only hemispheres at a time and solve for one variable.  In this case I would start by considering the top hemisphere and solve for z, getting $z = \sqrt{-x^2 -y^2 + 1}$ .  Then the $df_x$ map would just be the Jacobian of f with the above relation plugged in for z.  I can thus consider the rank of this map at different points to see if I have an immersion.  This method again gets pretty ugly and I am not even sure if it is correct. 3)  The method I prefer but seem to get the opposite answer with is to consider the sphere as a level curve at 1 of the function $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$.  Then to solve this problem I consider the 3x3 matrix for $df_x$.  If it is rank 3 then f is an immersion as it will take the tangent space at any point on the sphere to a two dimensional subspace of $R^3$.  If it is rank 2 then we need to show that the tangent space at a point is sent to a two dimensional space under $df_x$.  One way I believe we can do this is to consider the normal vector (gradient of F) to this tangent plane and see what happens to it under $df_x$.

Assume that $X = \cup_i X_i$ is finite open covering, such that the $X_i$ as well as their intersections $X_i \cap X_j$ are concentrated, i.e. quasi-compact and quasi-separated (see Daniel Murfet's notes on concentrated schemes as well as EGA IV.1). Does it follow that $X$ is concentrated? I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question. Clearly $X$ is quasi-compact, as a finite union of quasi-compact subspaces. In order to show that $X$ is quasi-separated, it suffices to show that for open affines $U \subseteq X_i$ and $V \subseteq X_j$ their intersection $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact. Well this is clear for $i=j$ since $X_i$ is quasi-separated. But what happens for $i \neq j$? Somehow we have to use that $X_i \cap X_j$ is quasi-compact.

Does it follow that $X$ is concentrated? I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question. Clearly $X$ is quasi-compact, as a finite union of quasi-compact subspaces. In order to show that $X$ is quasi-separated, it suffices to show that for open affines $U \subseteq X_i$ and $V \subseteq X_j$ their intersection $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact.

Then we get a closed 3 manifold with a ribbon graph $\Omega'$, which is obtained by gluing $\Omega$ and $R$. We apply the invariant $\tau$ to this closed 3-manifold to obtain a TQFT. My question is that when we glue standard handlebodies to the boundaries, how do we define a framing of ribbon graphs, which are images of $R$.

I want to know about the following generalization, which I believe is false but cannot come up with a counterexample to. Suppose $f : E \to B$ is proper and locally of the form $U\times V \to V$ , ie every point $e \in E$ has a neighborhood $W \subset E$ of $e$ , some $U = U_e$ and a neighborhood $V \subset B$ of $f(e)$ such that $f(W) \subset V$ and there is a homoeomorphism $W \cong U \times V$ that takes $f$ to the projection. Then $f$ is a fiber bundle. Here I assume $B$ is locally compact, Hausdorff and locally connected (or locally contractible, or a manifold). $B$ should also be connected if your definition of fiber bundle insists that the fibers are constant (and not just locally constant). The map $f$ being proper means: $f^{-1}(K)$ is compact for $K \subset B$ compact. $f$ is separated : $\{(x, y) \mid f(x) = f(y)\}$ is closed in $E \times E$ (or $E$ is Hausdorff). Without this the line with doubled origin mapping to the line is a counterexample to even the covering space case. I am also happy to assume some niceness of $f^{-1}(b)$ for $b \in B$ (it is of course compact by properness). As noted above if $f^{-1}(b)$ is discrete then the statement is true. Even with the strongest variations of the assumptions above (ie $B$ compact manifold, $E$ Hausdorff, fibers of $f$ smooth manifolds), I believe this is false because it would reduce the proof of Ehresmann's theorem (for a proper submersion $f: E \to B$ ) to: Use the ""submersion theorem"" ( $\impliedby$ the implicit function theorem) to get that $f$ is a projection locally in $E$ . Use properness to upgrade that to $f$ being a projection locally in $B$ , ie a fiber bundle. This two step process, decoupling the submersion/smoothness and proper/topological parts, is actually how I think of Ehresmann's theorem, but all proofs I have seen leverage differentiability in patching together the different product-like neighborhoods. Except in the covering space case, where the (local) connectivity assumptions are enough to match up nearby fibers. I did find this MO post about Ehresmann's theorem with a comment by Ryan Budney which seems to say that there is a possibly-long-winded proof that uses not much more than the implicit function theorem. Note that if $f$ is a smooth map of manifolds that is locally (smoothly) a projection then it is automatically a submersion, so the smooth version of the statement is actually equivalent to Ehresmann's theorem.

Obviously, it suffices to show this for a closed unit ball and I was thinking something like $$\left \|x  \right \|f\left(\frac{x}{\left \| x \right \|}\right) + \dfrac{1 -\left \| x \right \|}{2},$$ but that does not quite do it.
