I think I proved that $G$ is abelian and therefore the inverse of Lagrange holds but I am not so sure about my proof. So, since $45=5\times 3^{2}$ we can easily prove that there is a unique 5-Sylow subgroup of order 5 (let's call this $H$ ) and a unique 3-Sylow subgroup of order 9 (let's call this $K$ ), both of which are normal. (They are also abelian since $|H|=5$ , prime and thus cyclic and $|K|=9=3^{2}$ and we know that every group of order $p^{2}$ is abelian.) Now since they are normal $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$ and since $5$ , $9$ are coprime we have that $H\cap K= \{1_{G} \}$ . Thus, since $$|HK|=\frac{|H||K|}{|H\cap K|} $$ we have that $HK=G$ . Now we prove that $HK$ is abelian. Firstly, we have $hk=kh$ $\forall h\in H, k\in K$ . Indeed we have that $(h,k)=hkh^{1}k^{-1} \in H$ and $ (h,k)\in K$ beacause $H, K$ are normal and thus $(h,k)\in H\cap K =\{1_{G}\}$ . Now, if $g_{1}=h_{1}k_{1}, g_{2}=h_{2}k_{2} \in G$ then $$g_{1}g_{2}=h_{1}k_{1}h_{2}k_{2}=h_{2}k_{2}h_{1}k_{1}=g_{2}g_{1}$$ using the fact that $H,K $ are abelian and that $hk=kh$ . Therefore $G$ is abelian.

31,Ways to guarantee that a group presentation defines a finite group when randomly generating group presentations,Ways to guarantee that a group presentation defines a finite group when randomly generating group presentations,,"What are some ways to guarantee that a group presentation defines a finite group? Or, equivalently, is there a convenient sufficient condition for a generators-and-relations presentation of a group defining a finite group that's useful for randomly generating such groups. If there are no known convenient sufficient conditions, I am okay with a condition that gives me a finite group with high probability. I'm interested in ways of generating random finite groups. I can think of two obvious approaches: generating random instances of some other structure like a graph or a magma and looking at its automorphisms. taking a set of generators and imposing some random relations on it. I like the generators and relations presentation of groups, since the artifact that it gives me back is easy to compute with. One problem though is that it seems to hard to tell in general (maybe undecidable?) whether the defined group is finite or not. For example, $\langle a, b : a^2 = b^2 = 1 \rangle$ is not a finite group because $a \cdot b$ has infinite order. I can think of a very heavy-handed approach that might allow me to insist that the group in question is finite ... and that is using the equivalent of an axiom schema to set an upper bound (in the sense of the divisibility relation) on the order of each element. $\langle a, b : \xi^4 = 1 \;\text{and}\; a^2 = b^2 = 1 \rangle$ (where $\xi^4 = 1$ is a relation schema) defines a finite group. In order to prove this we can write an algorithm for taking any product of generators of length $\ge 8$ . Proof First, suppose the product is $^{-1}$ -free and has length $8$ , then the product contains $a \cdot a$ , contains $b \cdot b$ , or consists of the same segment repeated four times. A rewrite to a strictly shorter product is thus possible. If the product does contain $^{-1}$ , we first normalize it so that only generators are inverted, then we use the rewrites $a^{-1} = a$ and $b^{-1} = b$ . End of Proof This answer which references the Grigorchuk group , though, makes me think that just insisting that my group is finitely generated and every element has finite order isn't enough. So, I guess, to sum up the question: Is there a nice sufficient condition for group finiteness that I can impose on a generators-and-relations presentation of a group?

68,Generalizing a proof of Cauchy's Theorem,Generalizing a proof of Cauchy's Theorem,,"Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ a prime dividing $|G|$ . There is a nice proof of Cauchy's Theorem in Aluffi's ""Algebra Chapter 0"" that makes use of an action (by cyclic permutation) of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ on the set of tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_p)$ with $x_i\in G$ such that $x_1\cdots x_p=1$ . Essentially, the argument shows that the set of fixed points of this action, namely, the collection of tuples of the form $(x,\ldots,x)$ with $x^p=1$ , must have size divisible by $p$ , and since $(1,\ldots,1)$ is in there, we get an element of order $p$ . I noticed that this argument can be extended to prove the following: If $G$ is a finite group, $p$ divides $|G|$ , $\emptyset\neq H\subseteq Z(G)$ , and $N$ denotes the number of $x\in G$ with $x^p\in H$ , then $p$ divides $N$ . For the proof, consider the set of tuples $S=\{(x_1,\ldots,x_p): x_i\in G, x_1\cdots x_p\in H\}$ . We can count the number of elements of $S$ as follows: For any $h\in H$ , we may choose $x_1,\ldots,x_{p-1}$ arbitrarily before $x_p=(x_1\cdots x_{p-1})^{-1}h$ is determined. This shows (I think) that $|S|=|G|^{p-1}|H|$ , a multiple of $p$ . Now, if $(x_1,\ldots,x_p)\in S$ , then $x_1\cdots x_p=h$ for some $h\in H$ . Since $h\in Z(G)$ , we have $x_2\cdots x_p=x_1^{-1}h=hx_1^{-1}\implies x_2\cdots x_px_1=h\implies (x_2,\ldots,x_p,x_1)\in S$ . So, we get an action of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ on $S$ by cyclic permutation, as in the proof of Cauchy's Theorem. Again, the fixed points are the ""constant"" tuples in $S$ , and the formula $|S|=|\{$ fixed points $\}|+\sum\{$ sizes of nontrivial orbits $\}$ shows that $p$ divides $N$ . Of course, we can now quickly deduce Cauchy's Theorem by setting $H=\{1\}$ and noting that since $1^p=1$ , $N\geq p$ . My questions are: Is the above result well-known? Is it interesting?

Let $A<G$ . When is it true that $G$ has only a single maximal subgroup containing (or equal to) $A$ ?

Let $n_r(G) \in \mathbb{N}_0$ be the amount of elements that have exactly order $r \geq 2$ in $G$ . For which numbers $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ can we find/construct groups $G$ such that $n_r(G) = k$ ? For $k$ such that it is possible, can one find representatives only constructed using cyclic groups and semidirect (including direct) products? What about if we drop the finiteness requirement?

Feel free to call me out on any nonsense I may write. As already discussed in this question debating the existence of a group with exactly $68$ resp. $92$ elements of order $3$ , this question is highly non-trivial for the case $r \neq 2$ (but affirmative if $r = 2$ by using dihedral groups). I have been able to deduce from this post that for $p$ prime we have $$n_{p} \equiv p-1 \mod p(p-1)$$ by a result of Frobenius ( $n_p = p-1 \mod p$ ) and using that every element (except $e)$ has order $p$ in element-generated subgroups of size $p$ (such that $n_p \equiv 0 \mod p-1$ ). This weeds out the cases we must check dramatically, e.g. we have $$n_3 \equiv 2 \mod 6 \text{ and } n_5 \equiv 4 \mod 20 \text{ and } n_7 \equiv 6 \mod 42 \ldots$$ For a given prime $p$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$ , we can obviously cover the cases $n_p = p^m-1$ with the group $(\mathbb{Z}_p)^m$ - the $m$ -times iterated direct product of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ .

Given an algebraic group , a right -torsor , and a left -space , how is the space defined, and what is it called? An example of its use (from Richarz, ""A new approach to the geometric Satake equivalence""; note that is a right -quotient ): Consider the following diagram of ind-schemes Here (resp. ) is a right -torsor with respect to the -action on the left factor (resp. the diagonal action). The -action on factors through , giving rise to the morphism . If I want to take this as a definition (quotient a Cartesian product of two -sets by the diagonal action), I am still not sure what kind of quotient I should be using, and I have some further questions I'd rather not probe alone if I don't have to. When is a -torsor, an sheaf, an algebraic space, an ind-scheme, etc.? Does the side of the -action on or matter for the definition? Is the notation symmetric in and ? Is it necessary that be a torsor? Are there other necessary conditions to define the space?

I'm trying to learn how to solve problems this way, and any other examples will help me understand the technique.",,"['group-theory', 'graph-theory', 'contest-math', 'parity']"

99,Cardinality of set of groups,Cardinality of set of groups,,"After analyzing this question I started wondering. Thoughts . Everyone can give a simple example of a countable group $G, |G| = \aleph_0$ which has uncountable number $2^{\aleph_0}$ subgroups, for instance $G = \bigoplus_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{Z}_2$ but if we are going to assume only non-isomorphic subgroups it turns out that $G$ has only countable number of them. We can modify this example to $G = \bigoplus_{p_n}\mathbb{Z}_{p_n}$ ($p_n$ are primes) and it will satisfy the condition. It is obvious that number of countable groups that have $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-isomorphic subgroups is uncountable since we can construct $2^{\aleph_0}$ of them as follows. Denote $\Pi_1 = \{p_1, p_3, p_5, \dots\}, \Pi_2 = \{p_2,p_4, p_6, \dots\}$. Now our set will be $\{(\bigoplus_{p_k \in \Pi_1}\mathbb{Z}_{p_k})\oplus (\bigoplus_{p'_k \in A}\mathbb{Z}_{p'_k}) \mid\forall A \subset \Pi_2\}$. Obvious that this set is uncountable and all groups from this set are countable and has $2^{\aleph_0}$ non-isomorphic subgroups. Problem . But what is about cardinality of the set $X$ ($X_A$ for abelian) of all countable groups that have $\aleph_0$ non-isomorphic subgroups? Solution (for finitely generated abelian case) If we will assume only abelian groups then $|X_A| = \aleph_0$ since we can decompose each group into direct sum of prime ($\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_p$) and if number of non-isomorphic summands will be infinite then number of non-isomorphic subgroups is uncountable. Hence every $G \in X_A$ has finite number of non-isomorphic summands. And there are countably many different prime summands. So finally we got that $|X_A| = \aleph_0$. But can situation be changed using all abelian or non-abelian groups? P.S. Where I'm saying ""set of groups"" one should understand ""set of isomorphism classes"".","After analyzing this question I started wondering. Thoughts .
