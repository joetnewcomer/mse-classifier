6,A problem with lambda calculus notation and semantics for function-valued functions,A problem with lambda calculus notation and semantics for function-valued functions,,"I would like to understand how to use the $\lambda$ -notation to write usual (set-theoretic) functions, and if it is possible at all. Here are my naïve attempts.  Assume that all variables are real-valued. (I am using here the notation with "" $\mapsto$ "" instead of "" $\lambda$ "".) Example 1. If $f = x\mapsto \dfrac{1}{x}$ and $g_1 = x\mapsto 2x$ , then $g_1\circ f = x\mapsto 2\cdot\dfrac{1}{x}$ , and the domain of definition of $g_1\circ f$ is $D_{g_1\circ f}=\mathbf{R}\setminus\{0\}$ . Example 2. If $h_1 = x\mapsto \left(y\mapsto \dfrac{y}{x}\right)$ , then $D_{h_1}=\mathbf{R}$ , and $h_1(0)$ is the empty (nowhere defined) function. Example 3. If $h_2 = x\mapsto \left(y\mapsto \dfrac{1}{x}\cdot y\right)$ , then $h_2 = h_1$ and $D_{h_2}=\mathbf{R}$ . My question. Consider now $f = x\mapsto \dfrac{1}{x}$ and $g_2 = x\mapsto(y\mapsto xy)$ .

I have realized that a part of this phenomenon does not involve lambda-calculus.  The problem is that there is an infinity of ways to ""curry"" a set-theoretic function of two arguments. For example, the function $f(x, y) = \dfrac{y}{x}$ of real arguments can be curried as $$ \hat{f}(x) = y\mapsto\frac{y}{x}\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R},\quad x\in\mathbf{R}^* =\mathbf{R}\setminus\{0\}, $$ or as $$ \hat{f}(x) = \begin{cases} y\mapsto\dfrac{y}{x}\colon\mathbf{R}\to\mathbf{R} &\text{if}\ x \ne 0\\ \emptyset\ \text{(the empty function)} &\text{if}\ x = 0 \end{cases},\quad x\in\mathbf{R}. $$ Update.

Thanks.","I am working on a Pie Chart, and am using a tutorial that states… An easy way to get the relative value is to normalize the array and use the normal value [0, 1] to arrive at the angle of the slice, ie. normal * 2 * M_PI . For example, if the normal value is 0.5 , the angle of the slice will be M_PI or 180° . What do they mean, by normal ? Ok, so I looked it up (hey, I got a 5 on the Calculus AP, but that was a long time ago ).. and realize now that to normalize means to multiply (a series, function, or item of data) by a factor that makes the norm or some associated quantity such as an integral equal to a desired value (usually 1).   • Computing (in floating-point representation) express (a number) in the standard form with regard to the position of the radix point, usually immediately following the first nonzero digit. OK, so I'm sure I could figure that out.. but again, imagine this is a golden-retriever trying to do this... Going into it, I had imagined I'd be calculating my ""slices"" like… 10 items = 100% ( item.count / items.total ) * 360 = slice.angle Seems simple enough.  Maybe too simple.  Am I missing something here?  Is there a reason that I should be using normalization for this, opposed to something more familiar / simplistic?  Thanks.",,"['geometry', 'functions']"

My attempt: Let . Then there is a , and then a . But , since is impossible (but why...?). Hence Next, let . Then there is a , and then a . But , since is impossible (but why is this...?). Hence . Together, I regard this proof as flawed, at least incomplete. Why must ? If would be a bijective, the inverse function would be defined and the composition would be the ""identity function""... but the function is not necessarily injective and surjective. I also realise that making the assumption that actually is what we wanted to show in the first place... :) So, this is not a proof, I realise. Perhaps I could make an assumption that and see that this would lead to a contradiction, in some way...","X,Y f : X \rightarrow Y B \subseteq Y f(f^{-1}(B))=B y \in f(f^{-1}(B)) x \in f^{-1}(B) y' \in B y'=y f(f^{-1}(y')) \neq y f(f^{-1}(B)) \subset B y \in B x \in f^{-1}(B) y' \in f(x) y'=y f(f^{-1}(y')) \neq y B \subset f(f^{-1}(B)) f(f^{-1}(B))=B f(f^{-1}(y'))=y f f^{-1} f(f^{-1}(y))=y f(f^{-1}(y))\neq y",['functions']
