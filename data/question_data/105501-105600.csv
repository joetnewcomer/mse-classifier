For equations of planes in 3d, the coefficients $A$ , $B$ and $C$ in $Ax + By + Cz + D = 0$ represent a vector perpendicular to the plane! My goal was to find such a connection for 2d lines. Indeed, for $Ax + By = 0$ , the dot product of any vector $(x,y)$ with $(A,B)$ is $0$ . And the constant term can arise when we shift our origin! My goal then is to see how this shift of the origin relates to the constant term that’s added. Notice that the intercepts of the line $Ax + By + C = 0$ are $|\frac{-C}{A}|$ and $|\frac{-C}{B}|$ and the distance between this line and another line $Ax + By + D = 0$ is $\frac{\left|C-D\right|}{\sqrt{A^{2\ }+B^{2}}}$ . The pattern is clearly visible if we set $D = 0$ . I wanted to see how I could relate this to vectors. Firstly, the distance between the origin and the line can be written as $k\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$ where $k \in \Bbb{R^+}$ . This distance is also the dot product $(kA,kB)\cdot(|\frac{-C}{A}|,0)$ .

15,Highly polytopic algebras,Highly polytopic algebras,,"( Update: I ended up posting two answers for this, each addressing different things. I feel the second one is more deserving to be accepted if nobody posts a better answer.) Aside from the complex numbers, the triplex numbers , and their isomorphisms, I'd like to know which other unital algebras with dimensions greater than one follow these rules: The algebra must contain non-trivial finite cyclic groups under multiplication aside from $\{-1,1\}$ . This means the algebra has more than two ""roots of unity"". Given any such cyclic group, the elements of the group must form some or all the vertices of a single regular convex polytope instance in the underlying vector space of the algebra. For a cyclic group $G$ that forms vertices of a polytope instance $P$ , let's call $G$ a ""polytopic group"" of $P$ . If $G$ covers all the vertices of $P$ , let's call it a ""full polytopic group"" of $P$ . Since only $n$ -simplexes, $n$ -orthoplexes, and $n$ -orthotopes have regular convex variants in all dimensions $n$ , we can restrict ourselves to those polytope families, but let us add a third rule: If the algebra is $n$ -dimensional, all regular convex simplexes, orthoplexes, and orthotopes of $n$ dimensions or less must have instances in the underlying vector space such that, for any such polytope instance $P$ , there are polytopic groups of $P$ that collectively cover all its vertices. Let us call such an algebra a "" highly polytopic algebra "". For $n=2$ , as implied, $\Bbb{C}$ is a highly polytopic algebra. The imaginary unit $i$ and its powers are a full polytopic group of a square (which is both a 2-orthoplex and a 2-orthotope), and the third roots of unity in the complex plane are a full polytopic group of an equilateral triangle (2-simplex). I don't think split-complex numbers have polytopic groups that cover all three vertices of an equilateral triangle, and dual numbers don't even have that for a square, but please correct me if I'm wrong. For $n=3$ , I believe the three-dimensional triplex numbers (which, I've been told, is isomorphic to $\mathbb R\times \mathbb C$ ) is also highly polytopic, as I'll try to demonstrate below. To lessen confusion, let's denote the two non-real elements of the triplex basis as $j$ and $k$ . Triplex number multiplication is commutative and has $j^3=k^3=jk=1$ , $j^2=k$ , and $k^2=j$ . We find the following polytopic groups in triplex space: $3$ -orthoplex $1$ , $j$ , $k$ and their negatives form a full polytopic group of a regular octahedron , with its generator elements being $-j$ and $-k$ : $$-j\to{k}\to{-1}\to{j}\to{-k}\to{1}$$ $$-k\to{j}\to{-1}\to{k}\to{-j}\to{1}$$ $2$ -orthoplex/ $2$ -orthotope Side note: The non-unit circle that touches $1$ , $j$ , and $k$ and with radius $\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ shares one important property with the unit circle on the complex plane: A full polytopic group of any regular polygon can be generated on the circle using an exponential formula. For the triplex numbers, a generator for an $n$ -sided polygon is equals to $e^{\frac{2\pi}{n\sqrt{3}}(j-k)}$ . Using that formula, we find that $s=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}j+\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{3}k$ is a generator of a square on the circle described above. $$\left(s=\frac{1}{3}-\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}j+\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{3}k\right)\to{\left(s^2=-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}j+\frac{2}{3}k\right)}\to{\left(s^3=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{\sqrt{3}+1}{3}j-\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}k\right)}\to{\left(s^4=1\right)}$$ $3$ -orthotope The square we just described above is a face of a cube centered at the origin in triplex space. The other vertices of the cube are the negatives of $s$ and its powers. Notably, $-s=-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}j-\frac{(\sqrt{3}+1)}{3}k$ is equivalent to the number $c$ I mentioned in this question about what I call ""cubic numbers"". This cube's vertices are covered by four polytopic groups: $\{s, s^2, s^3, 1\}$ , $\{-s, s^2, -s^3, 1\}$ , $\{-s^2, 1\}$ , and $\{-1, 1\}$ , but perhaps there's a full polytopic group of a cube there somewhere that I didn't find. $3$ -simplex $-s$ is also a generator of a full polytopic group of one of the demicubes of the cube described above: $$\left(-s=-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}j-\frac{(\sqrt{3}+1)}{3}k\right)\to{\left(s^2\right)}\to{\left(-s^3=-\frac{1}{3}-\frac{(\sqrt{3}+1)}{3}j+\frac{(\sqrt{3}-1)}{3}k\right)}\to{\left(1\right)}$$ A demicube is of course a regular tetrahedron $2$ -simplex This one's the easiest: The third roots of unity $1$ , $j$ , and $k$ form a full polytopic group of an equilateral triangle . This could also be seen by evaluating $e^{\frac{2\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}(j-k)}$ . You could check out the above-mentioned triplex polytopes in this geogebra link . (The point labeled ""A"" is meant to be the multiplicative identity.) Questions: Is there any highly polytopic algebra in four dimensions? I know $\Bbb{H}$ is not highly polytopic because quaternion powers are always co-planar with each other and the origin, so $\Bbb{H}$ doesn't have polytopic groups of regular polyhedra and polychora aside from the 3-orthoplex and the 4-orthoplex. I ultimately would like to know if there's an algorithm to construct highly polytopic algebras in higher dimensions. Also, unfortunately I can't seem to find a full polytopic group of a cube in triplex space. If there is one, perhaps I could make a stronger definition of ""polytopic group"" that is synonymous to full polytopic groups. Is it possible that I just missed one? Motivation: I'm mainly interested in full polytopic groups of $n$ -simplexes because they relate to other ideas I've had in the past, particularly the $n$ -rational numbers , but I figured that adding the other polytope families might potentially be more interesting (and perhaps more useful?) for others.","( Update: I ended up posting two answers for this, each addressing different things.

I know that the two points are connected by a spherical arch. That is, they both lie on the same sphere, and the two unit vectors both point along this sphere (tangential to the sphere). I also know the arch length between the two points, but I am not given the actual positions of the points (need to set a reference). I need a parameterization in one variable f(t) of the curve between the two points. Figure: Parametrize curve along sphere from Q to P From what I figure, it should be defined by the central angle between the points ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance ) and the radius R of the sphere, which I have both found. But I can't figure out how to make a parameterization f(t) = [x(t), y(t), z(t)]. EDIT: Note that I am not given the positions A and B, only the unit vector in these points which is assumed to point tangential to the sphere and the arch length between them. This is a real life problem, and the apparatus gives direction of motion at t_0 and direction of motion at t_1 and the distance travelled. It is assumed to travel in spherical motions with a large R (I can adjust for the R later). So I can naturally set the position of A to (0,0,0), but I am not given the position of B.

20,Which shape is the worst to pack in $\mathbb{R}^n$?,Which shape is the worst to pack in ?,\mathbb{R}^n,"Yesterday I bought a box of chocolates and remarked with a friend how they had just put enough in to get above a certain transparent window to the inside but everything else was empty space. I added that this was probably particularly bad because it doesn't seem like the spherical-shaped chocolates would pack very well (in comparison to, say, cubes). I wondered if in fact the sphere is the worst ""shape"" to pack, but I'm not entirely sure what the most natural formalisation of this question is. The following is my first attempt, which I have no idea how to prove, but I am open to suggestion for better formalisations: We will call a tile of $\mathbb{R}^n$ a convex compact subset and we will say two tiles are almost disjoint if their intersection is a subset of their boundaries. I can't necessarily remember what little measure theory I knew but probably we want some kind of normalisation condition and I think convex compact subsets are measurable, so let's say we also want tiles to have (Lebesgue) measure one. Is it true that the tile with least packing density for any $n$ is the $n$ -dimensional closed ball (of appropriate size to have volume 1)? If we remove the convexity condition but say, we still want our tiles to be connected, my thoughts are that there is in fact no tile of least packing density as we can just take $n$ -dimensional (closed) annuli which are thinner and thinner with increasing radii to retain having volume 1 and these have arbtrarily low packing density. Is this correct also? EDIT: Based on a suggestion in the comments, I wish to clarify that ""packing"" here permits tiling by translation and rotation of the tiles.","Yesterday I bought a box of chocolates and remarked with a friend how they had just put enough in to get above a certain transparent window to the inside but everything else was empty space.

21,Overlap of disk and grid cell,Overlap of disk and grid cell,,"I have a disk of radius $r$ centered at the origin. Space is divided into square grid cells of size $1$ , with the origin $(0, 0)$ being at the center of one such grid cell. For each grid cell in the plane, I need to know its overlap $f$ with the disk, meaning the fraction (or area) of the cell that is enclosed by the circle of radius $r$ . The figure below illustrates the setup, with non-zero $f$ values written within each such cell. Question What is the general formula for $f$ , given the radius $r$ and some cell specified by its integer coordinates $(i, j)$ ? What I already know I have the following for finding out whether a cell $(i, j)$ is completely outside or contained completely within the disk: $$ \begin{align} \biggl(|i| - \frac{1}{2}\biggr)^2 + \biggl(|j| - \frac{1}{2}\biggr)^2 &\ge r^2 \Rightarrow f(i, j) = 0 \quad \text{(outside)} \\ \biggl(|i| + \frac{1}{2}\biggr)^2 + \biggl(|j| + \frac{1}{2}\biggr)^2 &\le r^2 \Rightarrow f(i, j) = 1 \quad \text{(inside)} \\ \end{align} $$ When none of these are true, we have $0 < f < 1$ , for which I'm in need of a formula. I've also realized that the symmetry generally allows me to consider only the positive quadrant, i.e. $i\rightarrow |i|$ , $j\rightarrow |j|$ .

32,Intersection of n circles,Intersection of n circles,,"I am trying to devise a general method (ultimately an R script) to calculate the area of the union of $n$ circles, similarly to this post , except that I am not constraining the radius to be equal for all circles. Same as the above post, I am opting for the inclusion-exclusion approach with the formula in this answer , which means I need to calculate the areas of the intersections of all possible sets of 2, 3, ..., n circles that do overlap . So the first problem I had to tackle was: when do $m \le n$ circles have a non-empty intersection? I started by looking at the case with $m = 2$ . Apparently, if $d$ is the distance between the centres of the two circles, and $R_1, R_2$ their radii, their perimeters have two distinct intersection points (i.e. there is a non-empty overlapping region that does not degenerate to a whole circle) only if $|R_1 - R_2| < d < R_1+R_2$ (this would be case 3 below): Then I set out to calculate the area of the two circular segments that form the intersection. They are already available in some websites, but I wanted to delve into this myself, to understand the machinery of it. And indeed, in doing that I found a complication that does not seem to be addressed by most websites. The most common case is 1 above, where the sum of the areas of the circular segments (which by convention is always calculated as the 'smaller' cut-off of the circle) is indeed equal to the intersection of the two circles. However, as $d$ decreases, at some point the chord becomes equal to the diameter of the smaller circle (case 2). The general formula still holds, and it simply gives half the area of the whole small circle. For $d$ below that, however, the formula based on the chord length fails: one would need to take the 'larger' part of the smaller circle that is cut off by the chord (so basically its total area minus the 'conventional' circular segment). This is case 3. I found that this happens when $d < \sqrt {|R_1^2-R_2^2|}$ . My own formulae, based on $d$ rather than on the chord length, still work, because the area of the triangle that must be subtracted from the area of the circular sector to obtain the one of the circular segment becomes negative, so it is in fact summed. Still I thought it was important to find this out. To tackle cases with $m > 2$ , my main questions/doubts at the moment are: how to find a condition (based on $d$ 's and radii) that determines when there is a non-empty intersection between $m$ circles whether the above issue with a smaller circle being 'more inside' another circle than 'outside' would affect those cases, too, or not So I am trying to find what condition differentiates case 1 from 2 below: And of course the same for $m = 4, 5, ..., n$ . Intuitively I am guessing that the circles' centres will need to be 'closer together' the larger $m$ gets, for a non-empty intersection between all $m$ circles to exist. But at the moment I would not know how to approach it. Any ideas/advice? Thanks! EDIT clarification I can calculate the positions of points $A, B, C$ in the above picture. What I don't know is how to test if these points enclose an area that belongs to the intersection of the 3 circles (case 1) or not (case 2). It might be obvious or very easy, but I just have not figured it out, yet, so I would appreciate any advice on the matter. E.g. I can see that in case 1 each point $P$ in $A, B, C$ , is 'inside' the 3rd circle (i.e. $P$ is at a distance $d < R$ from the centre of the circle that did not generate $P$ ). But I don't know if this is a generally valid test, and I don't immediately see how it would extend to $m > 3$ and to cases where the radii are all different.","I am trying to devise a general method (ultimately an R script) to calculate the area of the union of circles, similarly to this post , except that I am not constraining the radius to be equal for all circles.

In the non-equilateral triangle below, $CD, AD$ , and $BD$ concur at point $D$ . The angles $(a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f)$ in degrees are also placed as given in the figure below. Define a solvable triangle such that:  For a triangle like the one in the figure above, given two pairs of adjacent angles (say $a,b$ and $c,d$ ), if the remaining two angles (say $e,f$ ) can be found by a synthetic solution using elementary geometry, it is a solvable triangle. (Just to be clear, I have added an example at the end.) My questions are : Are all triangles containing integer angled sextuplets solvable triangles? What is the criterion for being a solvable triangle? Such a sextuplet must satisfy the Trigonometric Ceva's Theorem: $$\frac{\sin(a\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(b\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}\cdot\frac{\sin(c\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(d\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}\cdot\frac{\sin(e\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}{\sin(f\cdot\frac{\pi}{180})}= 1$$ We also know that, $$a+b+c+d+e+f=180°$$ In the comments of their accepted answer to my previous question, @user provided a sextuplet $\frac\pi{180}\{1,30,87,2,29,31\}$ with different integers to work on -I am also sure that there more such sextuplets which consist of different integers. Here is an example problem using this sextuplet (there are more such triangles that can be formed with this sextuplet): Let $\measuredangle ACD=31°$ , $\measuredangle BCD=30°$ , $\measuredangle CAD=1°$ , $\measuredangle BAD=2°$ in $\bigtriangleup ABC$ . Find $\color{green}{\text {$\measuredangle ABD$}}$ . Example Synthetic Solution: Since the angles are extremely small, I have reproduced the diagram by rescaling the angles (blue line segments represent the original problem and red line segments represent my constructions). Let’s select a point $E$ on $AD$ such that $AE=CE$ and connect $E$ and $C$ , so $\measuredangle ECA=1°$ . Let’s extend $BC$ and select a point $F$ on $BC$ such that $CE=CF$ , constructing the equilateral triangle $\bigtriangleup CEF$ . Angle chasing leads us to: $$\measuredangle DEC=2° \; \text{and} \; \measuredangle DEF=58°$$ Let’s connect points $F$ and $D$ . Since $CD$ is the angle bisector of the equilateral triangle $\bigtriangleup CEF$ , using congruency: $$\measuredangle DFB=2° \; \text{and} \; \measuredangle DFE=58°$$ Since $\bigtriangleup AEF$ is isosceles, $\measuredangle AFE=29°$ .

Help formalize my proof?,1/2,"Consider a triangle $ABC$ in the plane. Its vertices are all lattice points (their coordinates are integers.) Further, there are no other lattice points in this triangle, either on its boundary or interior. It can be shown in a number of ways that such a triangle has area $\frac{1}{2}$ . There are several questions on this site asking for proofs, but I have an idea for an argument that I haven't seen in the answers to those questions. I'm having a little trouble formalizing it, though, and I'm not entirely sure the idea can lead to a rigorous proof. My idea is this: Every triangle whose vertices are all lattice points necessarily has area of the form $\frac{n}{2}$ where $n$ is a positive integer (this would follow directly from the expression for the area of a triangle in terms of its vertices' coordinates.) If a triangle $ABC$ contains a lattice point $A'$ in its edge or interior, we can construct a new triangle $A'BC$ by replacing the vertex $A$ with $A'$ . Visually, it seems to me that such a triangle has strictly smaller area than $ABC$ does, and its vertices are also all lattice points, so its area is of the form $\frac{m}{2}$ with $0 < m < n$ . It should then follow immediately that any such $ABC$ has area greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ . It is easy to see that there are some lattice-point triangles having area $1/2$ , so the only lattice-point triangles having area $\frac{1}{2}$ are those that do not contain other lattice points. Something about this proof feels handwavy to me (in particular, I haven't justified that by replacing a vertex of a triangle with a point on its edge or in its interior, you obtain a strictly smaller triangle), but I think the basic outline is promising. Moreover, I've only established that any triangle containing lattice points has area $> 1/2$ , not that every triangle not containing lattice points has area $1/2$ .

I am having a little bit of trouble trying to prove this, if it is true. Here is my try, in a Hilbert Plane with the parallelism axiom: First, let $CD,\,BE$ be the medians of the sides $AC$ and $AB$ , respectively. Let $M$ be the point where these medians cut (that exists, as an easy application of Pasch's axiom). By hypothesis, $AD=BD$ , $AE=CE$ , and $BE=CD$ (hence $AB=2AD=2BD,\,AC=2AE=2CE)$ . Assuming the parallelism axiom , we have by Thales theorem (VI 2), that, since: $$\frac{AB}{AD}=\frac{AC}{AE}$$ $DE$ is parallel to $BC$ , and the triangles $ADE$ and $ABC$ are similar. In particular, $BC=2DE$ . Applying (I29) twice, we can conclude that the triangles $BCM$ and $EDM$ have all the same angles, so by (VI 4), we conclude that these are similar triangles. But then: $$\frac{BC}{ED}=\frac{CM}{DM}$$ And the left hand side equals $2$ , so we conclude that $CM=2DM$ , or in other words, $-$ since $CD=CM+MD\,-$ , that $CD=\frac{3}{2}CM$ . On the other hand, we also have that: $$\frac{BC}{ED}=\frac{BM}{EM}$$ And since the left hand side is equal to $2$ , we also obtain that $BM=2EM$ , or simply, that $BE=\frac{3}{2}BM$ But by hypothesis, $BE=\frac{3}{2}BM=\frac{3}{2}CM=CD$ , therefore $BM=CM$ . Applying (I6) to the isosceles triangle $MBC$ we conclude that $\angle MBC=\angle MCB$ .

For the sake of completeness of this post, I shall share how I approached the particular result using coordinate geometry. First, I wrote the equation of the normal (in parametric form) to the given rectangular hyperbola, and plugged in $(h,k)$ into it (the coordinates of point $O$). What resulted was a fourth degree equation, and I used Vieta's theorem to directly evaluate the required expression, to get $3(h^2+k^2)$.",,"['geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'conic-sections']"

91,The simplest billiards problem,The simplest billiards problem,,"The Problem: Let's say we have a rectangle of size $m \times n$ centered at the origin (or, if it makes the math easier, you can place it wherever on the plane). We take a billiard ball, represented by a point, in the center of the rectangle with a constant velocity vector $\vec{v}$. Assuming no other forces acting on the ball, write a function $f(m,n,t)$ that gives the position of the ball after $t$ seconds. My Work: I don't actually know all that much vector math (this is a junior high pre-calc class), so I tried to set this up as a geometry problem. With the constraints above, if we expand our velocity vector $\vec{v}=\langle a,b\rangle$, our problem is as shown: Let's call the angle the vector makes with the x-axis $\theta$. Making a triangle with our vector and the x-axis, we get that $\tan(\theta)=\frac{b}{a}$. So, $\theta=\arctan(\frac{b}{a})$. Now, if we want to find the vector pointing to where the ball is going to hit the boundary of the rectangle $\vec{h}$, we know it is going to be the same direction as $\vec{v}$, just a different magnitude. Mathematically put: $$\frac{1}{||v||}\vec{v}=\frac{1}{||h||}\vec{h}$$ We can calculate the magnitude of $\vec{h}$ by noticing that $$\sin(\theta)=\sin(\arctan(\frac ba))=\frac{\frac{m}{2}}{||h||}$$ Which simplifies quite nicely to: $$||h||=\frac{m \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2 b}$$ Returning to our original equation, we can re-arrange to get that $\frac{||h||}{||v||}\vec{v}=\vec{h}$. Since the magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$, this, astoundingly, simplifies to $\vec{h}=\frac{m}{2b}\vec{v}$, leading me to believe there was a way easier way to do what I did. So, we found the first point that the ball will ""bounce"" at. But I have no idea how to model the ball ""reflecting"" and then to calculate where it will bounce again and again.
