Is there a closed subtorus $T^\perp$ of $\mathbb{T}^d$ such that $\mathbb{T}^d=T^\perp \oplus T$?

I started out with the following: Suppose that $\Gamma$ acts on a compact Hausdroff space $X$. There exists a $\Gamma$-invariant subalgebra of $C(X)$ iff there exists an injective $\Gamma$-equivariant map from a $\Gamma$-space $A$ to $C(X)$. Suppose that $B$ is an invariant subalgebra of $C(X)$. Let $j: B \to C(X)$ be the inclusion map. Then $j$ is injective. Moreover $j(s.b)=s.b=s.j(b)$. So $j$ is $\Gamma$-equivariant. On the other hand suppose that there is an injective $\Gamma$-equivariant map $\phi$ from a  $\Gamma$-space $A$ to $C(X)$. Then $\phi(A)$ is a subset of $C(X)$. Moreover $s.\phi(a)=\phi(s.a) \in \phi(A) \subset C(X)$. Thus $\phi(A)$ is $\Gamma$-invariant. But then I realized that $\phi(A)$ is not necessarily a sub algebra of $C(X)$. To make it a subalgebra I have to impose a condition on $\phi$. So I thought of making $\phi$ a linear homomorphism. Then this establishes the claim. I want to know if this is optimal in the sense that if there can be any other condition weaker than what I have got here.

31,How to use a stabilizer chain (Schreier-Sims) to prune a centralizer search?,How to use a stabilizer chain (Schreier-Sims) to prune a centralizer search?,,"I've implemented the Schreier-Sims algorithm. My sources indicate that a next useful step is to use this structure to prune a backtracking search of group elements, which should yield an improvement on exhaustively searching the group. I think I can see how to approach the problem of finding a (nontrivial) graph automorphism via a search of the full group $S_n$, though I haven't done it yet. My question is how to use the stabilizer chain structure to prune a centralizer search and/or a conjugacy test. For the sake of discussion, all group elements below are permutations of $n$ points and permutations compose right-to-left, the usual convention in mathematical contexts. A stabilizer chain for a group $G$ is a subgroup series $$ S_n \ge G = G^{(0)} > G^{(1)} > \dots > G^{(m)} = \langle 1 \rangle $$ where for $i=1 \ldots m$, $G^{(i)}$ is the largest subgroup of $G^{(i-1)}$ stabilizing some point $\beta_i$ (distinct for distinct $i$). So every permutation in $G^{(i)}$ has $\beta_i$ as a fixed point, hence it also fixes $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots \beta_{i-1}$. As a consequence of this structure, every element of $G$ can be written inductively $g = h_1 h_2 \dots h_m $ where $h_i$ is a coset representatives of $G^{(i)}$ in $G^{(i-1)}$. These coset representatives are readily available because they are elements of a transversal for the orbit of $\beta_i$ under the permutation action of $G^{(i-1)}$, which was computed during Schreier-Sims. The general idea of backtracking search is to conditionally eliminate the entire coset $\left( h_1 h_2 \ldots h_i \right) G^{(i)}$ from consideration by inspecting the partial product $h_1 h_2 \dots h_i$ for some task-specific property. The partial product fully determines the image of points $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_i$ under the entire coset because those points are fixed by $G^{(i)}$. In the case of graph automorphism search, the coset may be skipped if $h_{i}$ permutes the $\beta_{i}$-labeled vertex in a way that violates the graph structure: if there is (or is not) an edge between vertices labeled by $\beta_i$ and $\beta_j$, there should (or should not) be an edge between vertices labeled by their image under $h_1 h_2 \ldots h_i$.

I appreciate your help a lot! Thanks! $ \rule{14.8cm}{0.6pt}$ $\textbf{Proof:}$ First we start by claiming that a group $A$ is divisible if and only if it satisfies the following “injectivity” condition:  Any homomorphism $f : L \to A$ from any group $L$ into $A$ extends to any group $H$ which contains $L$, i.e., there exists a homomorphism $\bar{f} : H → A$ so that $f\bar{f}|_L = f$. For to prove this claim, We use Zorn’s Lemma. Consider the partially ordered set $P$ of all pairs $(C, g)$ where $C$ is a subgroup of $H$ containing $L$ and $g : C \to G$ is an extension of $f$. Let $(C, g) \leq (A, h)$ if $C \leq A$ and $g = h\mid_C$. The set $P$ is nonempty since it contains $(L, f)$. Also any tower $(C_{\alpha}, g_{\alpha})$ in $P$ has an upper bound  $(\cup C_\alpha,\cup g_{\alpha}) \in P$. Consequently, by Zorn’s Lemma, $P$ has a maximal element, say $(C, g)$. We claim that $C = H$ and $g$ is the desired extension of $f$ to $H$. To see this suppose $C < H$. Then there exists an $x \in H$ so that $x \notin C$. There are two cases Either $x + C$ has finite order in $H/C$ or it has infinite order. In the second case, $<C,x> = C \dot{\times} <x>$ so $g : C \to G$ can be extended to $g \dot{\times} 0 : C \dot{\times} <x> \to G$ contradicting the maximality of $(C, g)$. In the first case, let $n$ be the order of $x+C$ in $H/C$, i.e., $n > 0$ is smallest positive integer so that $nx \in C$. Since $G$ is divisible there is a $z \in G$ so that $nz = g(nx)$. By the Pasting lemma, $g : C \to G$ can be extended to the homomorphism $g \dot{\times} h : C \dot{\times} <x> \to G$ where $h : <x> \to G$ is given by $h(x) = z$. This contradicts the maximality of $(C, g)$. Therefore, divisible groups are injective. Conversely, if $G$ is injective then it is obviously divisible: given any $x \in G$ and $n > 0$ let $f : n\mathbb{Z} \to G$ be given by $f(n) = x$ .  If $G$ is injective this extends to a homomorphism $\bar{f} : \mathbb{Z} \to G$. But then $n\bar{f}(1) = f(n) = x$. Now we claim that any divisible subgroup of $G$ splits, i.e., if $A \leq G$ is divisible then $A$ has a complement $B$ so that $G = A \dot{\times} B$.

(I know the term appears in the Burnside finite groups book of 1911: “A permutation-group is called transitive when, by means of its permutations, a given symbol $a_1$ can be changed into every other symbol $a_2, a_3,\ldots, a_n$ operated on by the group.”) For transitive graphs, the notion of “transtitivity” seems to be straightforwardly related to transitive group actions:  A graph is vertex-transitive if its symmetry group acts transitively on the set of vertices.  (And similarly edge-transitivity.)  Did transitive graphs come first, and transitive group actions were a later generalization of that idea, or did transitive group actions come first, and then transitive graphs were an obvious special case?",,"['group-theory', 'terminology', 'math-history']"

That is I am trying to come up with a list of criteria for an arbitrary category which is sufficient to construct exact sequences and prove their properties and which is satisfied by the category group. Obviously one can develop exact sequences in an abelian category but Group is not abelian. I observe that Group has all kernels and cokernels, all equalizers and coequalizers, a zero object, and all epimorphisms are cokernels. I am trying to use only these hypotheses to define exact sequences and derive their properties but I am stuck. I can define $\textrm{im }f = \ker(\textrm{coker }f)$ and $\textrm{coim }f = \textrm{coker }(\ker f)$. Since all epimorphisms are cokernels $\textrm{coker }(\ker f)$ satisfies the definition of the coimage given by wikipedia. Further, the coimage produces an epic-monic factorization of $f$ because Group contains all coequalizers (this argument is from $\textit{Categories for the Working Mathematician}$ pg 193). The problem is that because Group is not normal, I cannot show that $\textrm{im }f = \ker(\textrm{coker }f)$ satisfies the universal property in the definition of the image, nor can I show that $\textrm{im }f = \textrm{coim }f$. To define exactness I say that $A \buildrel a\over\longrightarrow B \buildrel b\over\longrightarrow C$ is exact iff $\ker b = \ker(\textrm{coker }a)$ which I can show is equivalent to saying  $\textrm{coker }a = \textrm{coker }(\ker b)$. This has the benefit of not requiring equalizers, coequalizers, normality, or conormality because I am not requiring the kernel of the cokernel or the cokernel of the kernel to satisfy the definitions of the image or coimage respectively. My immediate goal is to use only my definition of exactness and the properties I have observed about Group to prove that in every short exact sequence, $$0 \longrightarrow A \buildrel a\over\longrightarrow B \buildrel b\over\longrightarrow C \longrightarrow 0$$  $a$ is monic and $b$ is epic. I have proven that $a$ is monic: Group is conormal with all coequalizers so $\textrm{coker }(\ker a) = \textrm{coim }a$ and yields an epic-monic factorization of $a$. Further, $\textrm{coker }0 = 1_A = \textrm{coker }(\ker a)$ by my definition of exactness so $a$ factors through $1_B$-monic and thus $a$ is monic. I am stuck at proving $b$ is epic. If I could show $\ker(\textrm{coker }a) = \textrm{coker }(\ker a) = \textrm{coim }a$ then I could dualize my previous argument and use the dual definition of exactness (ker = ker coker) to get the result. However I don't see how to establish this equality using the existence of equalizers, coequalizers, and conormality. I observe that any monomorphism can be factored through a normal monomorphism (since any subgroup is included in its normal closure) and that this factoring has a universal property by the minimality of the normal closure, but I can't quite see how to incorporate this into Mac Lane's argument fruitfully.

Was wondering what other methods can be used to reduce the size of the action group and thus the computation time of a recursive smallest grammar algorithm. Details We define the left action of a grammar rule such as $A\to abc$, on the string $s = abcabc$ (for example) by taking the leftmost occurrence of $abc \leqslant s$ and collapsing it to the variable $A$.  Applying $A$ twice yields $A^2 \circ s = AA$ in this case.  Applying a 3rd time restarts the process via expanding all $A$ occurences.  Since a smallest grammar expanded fully (up to pure literal rules) always has a leftmost variable occurence, or if it doesn't, you can transfer over to one that does, we believe one could enumerate all possible near-fully expanded grammars by acting on the start string $s$ with the set of all irreducible (and compressibly repeating) rules.  Once you have this enumeration, you then recurse (see the above links).  Of course, without any more study of this, the algorithm does appear to be non-polynomial in complexity class. Is there a way to filter out more ""fruitless"" elements from the group $G(s)$? For example, I'm next going to look into when $\text{RHS}(A) \leqslant \text{RHS}(B)$ as strings.

73,Cauchy sequence in universal algebra,Cauchy sequence in universal algebra,,"I finished working on algebraic cauchy sequences in june and have since then been having fun with universal algebra and generalizing algebraic structures and concepts and I had a thought today. So I am posting this as a question to see if it is valid and if there are any good sources to read up on it. In classical abstract algebra of rings, groups and modules we have the following definition, I will use group as it is in most cases based on it. For a given filtration $(G_n)$ of normal subgroups of $G$ such that $G_{n-1}\geq G_n$ we have that a sequence $(x_i)$ is cauchy if for a given $K$ that there exists an $N$ such that for $n,m\geq N$ we have that $x_nG_k=x_mG_k$. All dandy and fine for those categories but I was thinking if we expand it to be more general, universally so, what is needed? Obviously dealing with subgroups, ideals and such cannot be done, not all algebraic structures have those or something equivalent and even if they got something similar the differens in axioms and structure can still lend to anomolies appearing that makes it cumbersome to work with. So the obvious thing to go with is Congruence relatins then. So instead of a filtration of normal subgroups or the likes we would have this. For a given filtration $(\mathcal{R}_n)$ of congruence relations, $\mathcal{R}_n\in\text{Con}(A)$, such that $\mathcal{R}_n\subseteq\mathcal{R}_{n-1}$. That should take care of that issue as congruence relations are defined to respect the given structure we wouldn't need to worry about anything. And the subset part ensures it behaves like the other did. For the actual sequence part it'd still remain very similar and as $xN$ for a normal subgroup is just the equivalence class of $x \mod N$ we can go for equivalence classes such that it becomes A sequence $(x_i)\in A$ is cauchy if for a given $K$ there exists an $N$ such that for $n,m\geq N$ we have that $x_n/\mathcal{R}_K=x_m/\mathcal{R}_K$ Which should be a workable translation of those speical cases in the begining to a universal one that applies to any algebraic structure. With pointwise operations it would form another one of those structures as well as congruence relations makes it certain it will work. Edit - Addition: For completion we have also this definition. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then a sequence $(x_i)$ is a null sequence if for every $K$ we have an $N$ such that $i>N$ means that $x_i\in G_k$. Mark this subgroup as $N$, then $\mathcal{C}/N$ is the completion of the group with respect to the filtration. I thought further ahead on that issue and I attempt to translate it into this statement. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then two sequences $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$ are in the relation $\mathcal{R}$ if for a given $K$ we have there exists an $N$ such that for $i>N$ that $x_i/\mathcal{R}_K =y_i/\mathcal{R}_K$. Then the completion is then $\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{R}$. This is clearly a congruence relation and as such the quotient is meaningful and works. Is this a proper translation of the definition to the language of universal algebra? Are there any possible sources that have worked on it?","I finished working on algebraic cauchy sequences in june and have since then been having fun with universal algebra and generalizing algebraic structures and concepts and I had a thought today.

For the actual sequence part it'd still remain very similar and as $xN$ for a normal subgroup is just the equivalence class of $x \mod N$ we can go for equivalence classes such that it becomes A sequence $(x_i)\in A$ is cauchy if for a given $K$ there exists an $N$ such that for $n,m\geq N$ we have that $x_n/\mathcal{R}_K=x_m/\mathcal{R}_K$ Which should be a workable translation of those speical cases in the begining to a universal one that applies to any algebraic structure. With pointwise operations it would form another one of those structures as well as congruence relations makes it certain it will work. Edit - Addition: For completion we have also this definition. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then a sequence $(x_i)$ is a null sequence if for every $K$ we have an $N$ such that $i>N$ means that $x_i\in G_k$. Mark this subgroup as $N$, then $\mathcal{C}/N$ is the completion of the group with respect to the filtration. I thought further ahead on that issue and I attempt to translate it into this statement. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of cauchy sequences. Then two sequences $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$ are in the relation $\mathcal{R}$ if for a given $K$ we have there exists an $N$ such that for $i>N$ that $x_i/\mathcal{R}_K =y_i/\mathcal{R}_K$. Then the completion is then $\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{R}$. This is clearly a congruence relation and as such the quotient is meaningful and works. Is this a proper translation of the definition to the language of universal algebra? Are there any possible sources that have worked on it?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'reference-request', 'universal-algebra']"

I'm pretty sure this is right. The following discussion of how the right hand side arises is cribbed from [ Tata Lectures on Theta III , Mumford, Nori and Norman]; any mistakes my own. The space $\mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$ on the right corresponds naturally to the space of alternating bilinear maps $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$.  The link to $H^2$ comes from looking at the commutator map $G \times G \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in the corresponding central extension $$0 \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to G \to \mathbb{F}_p^n \to 0$$ and noting it descends to an alternating bilinear map  $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ on the quotient. If $\rho \colon \mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is an explicit 2-cocycle, then this alternating form is just $$\sigma(a,b) = \rho(a,b) - \rho(b,a) $$ and is readily seen to be invariant under adding coboundaries to $\rho$. So, this defines a homomorphism $$H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$$ and it's not hard to show it's surjective, i.e., to construct very explicit Heisenberg-group-type examples of group extensions or cocycles showing that every $\sigma$ arises in this way.  It is also clear that the kernel consists precisely of even cocycles (i.e., $\rho(a,b) = \rho(b,a)$) modulo coboundaries. My question is: Question: can someone give me an fairly explicit proof that this map is injective , and therefore that $H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$ is what we think it is? At some point a proof must use the fact that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ hasn't been replaced by, say, $\mathbb{F}_p$, as then cocycles corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \mathbb{Z}$ will be in the kernel.

As ever, any pointers or references greatly appreciated.","I'm interested in the computation of the second cohomology group of the elementary abelian group $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$: $$H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$$ where for simplicity let's suppose $p$ is odd.  I'm pretty sure this is right. The following discussion of how the right hand side arises is cribbed from [ Tata Lectures on Theta III , Mumford, Nori and Norman]; any mistakes my own. The space $\mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$ on the right corresponds naturally to the space of alternating bilinear maps $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$.  The link to $H^2$ comes from looking at the commutator map $G \times G \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ in the corresponding central extension $$0 \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} \to G \to \mathbb{F}_p^n \to 0$$ and noting it descends to an alternating bilinear map  $\mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ on the quotient. If $\rho \colon \mathbb{F}_p^n \times \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ is an explicit 2-cocycle, then this alternating form is just $$\sigma(a,b) = \rho(a,b) - \rho(b,a) $$ and is readily seen to be invariant under adding coboundaries to $\rho$. So, this defines a homomorphism $$H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}) \to \mathbb{F}_p^{n(n-1)/2}$$ and it's not hard to show it's surjective, i.e., to construct very explicit Heisenberg-group-type examples of group extensions or cocycles showing that every $\sigma$ arises in this way.  It is also clear that the kernel consists precisely of even cocycles (i.e., $\rho(a,b) = \rho(b,a)$) modulo coboundaries. My question is: Question: can someone give me an fairly explicit proof that this map is injective , and therefore that $H^2(\mathbb{F}_p^n, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$ is what we think it is? At some point a proof must use the fact that $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ hasn't been replaced by, say, $\mathbb{F}_p$, as then cocycles corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}/p^2 \mathbb{Z}$ will be in the kernel.

Let's draw the Cayley table of the group, that is, table $A$ with $a_{i,j}$ = [number of $x_i \circ x_j$ in the list $x_1, ..., x_n$] After that, if we erase $K$ entries of the table, for some $K$ it's always possible to determine the deleted entries, and for some $K$ it's not possible since there exist some group $G'$ (maybe, isomorphic to $G$ and maybe not) whose Cayley table is different from $A$, but only in some of the erased cells. The question is, whether it's always possible to determine original table (for all sufficiently large $n$) if $K=2n$. Here's what I know so far: if $K=4n-4$, the table can't be reconstructed when we delete 2 rows and 2 columns, corresponding to identity and some other element $x$ (so, after that we won't be able to determine the difference between them, and different tables for the same group count as different) if $K=n$, it's possible for $n \neq 4$, because if some column contains only one empty cell, we know what was written in that cell, since all elements in any column must be different after that, you have at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ columns in which you know every single entry Subset of $G$, corresponding to such columns, form a subgroup of $G$, since if you know $x\circ y$ for any $x$, and $x\circ z$ for any $x$ in $G$, then you know $x \circ y \circ z$ for any $x$ in $G$, and $y^{-1}=y^{n-1}$.

It follows that $O^p(G)$ is the product of all $Q\in Syl(G)$ such that $p \nmid |Q|$, for all primes $p$. Therefore, $\bigcap\limits_{p\ prime}O^p(G)=1$.","Let $G$ be a finite group and $\gamma_{\infty}(G)$ be the limit of the lower central series: $\gamma_1(G)=G$ and for all $i\ge 1, \gamma_{i+1}(G)=[\gamma_i(G),G]$ ? It can be shown that $\gamma_{\infty}(G)$ is  the nilpotent residual subgroup of $G$ i.e. for $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$, $G/N$ is nilpotent if and only if $\gamma_{\infty}(G)\le N$.

97,Write an element of a group as product of generators,Write an element of a group as product of generators,,"Say we have a finite group $G$ generated by $g_1,\cdots,g_n$. Are there any algorithms or techniques to write any element $g$ as a product of these generators? Ofcourse we could just try all combinations, but I hope there are more elegant ways, like in a vector space, you can just project your element on the generators. I'm asking because this is the group theoretic generalisation of solving a Rubik's cube. By labeling the stickers with natural numbers, we see that moves are permutations, and every legal position is one too. The Rubik's cube group is then the group that is generated by the legal moves: $$G=<R,L,U,D,F,B>$$ In standard notation To solve the cube is the same as to write an element of this group as a product of these generators, so in this case there are many algorithms to do this. What algorithms exist for the general case?","Say we have a finite group $G$ generated by $g_1,\cdots,g_n$.

Which of the exact sequences splits? Ok, i have to consider two cases for a group of order 4: $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, so i get two exact sequences: $0\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2}\overset{\psi }{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}_{4}\overset{\varphi }{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow 0$  and $0\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{2}\overset{\tilde{\psi} }{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}_{2}\overset{\tilde{\varphi} }{\rightarrow}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow 0$ For both cases i checked the conditions of exact sequence and proved that these are exact sequences. Now i have a problem how to show if they split or not.  We say that an exact sequence splits if for the first sequence there exists a group homomorphism $\pi :\mathbb{Z}_{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ with $\varphi \circ \pi =id_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}$ and for the second $\tilde{\varphi} \circ \tilde{\pi} =id_{\mathbb{Z}_{2}}$, right?
