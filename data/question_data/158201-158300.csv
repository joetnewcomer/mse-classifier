4,A conjecture about primorials,A conjecture about primorials,,"A primorial, denoted $p_n\#$ , is the product of the first $n$ prime numbers ( $p_1=2,\ p_2=3$ etc.). The magnitude of primorials grows rapidly beyond the range of convenient arithmetic manipulation.  The number $(p_n\#+1)$ is not divisible by any of the first $n$ primes, and so is frequently a prime number itself. For $n=1,2,3,4,5,11$ , $(p_n\#+1) \in \mathbb P$ . I noticed (for primorials accessible to calculation) that when $(p_n\#+1) \not \in \mathbb P$ , that a 'near primorial' number plus $1$ could be identified that was a prime. By near primorial number, I mean the product of all but one of the first $n$ primes, or $\frac{p_n\#}{p_i};\ 1<i<n$ . For example, $\frac{p_8\#}{3}+1,\ \frac{p_{10}\#}{3}+1,\ \frac{p_6\#}{5}+1,\ \frac{p_7\#}{5}+1,\ \frac{p_{12}\#}{7}+1,\ \frac{p_{13}\#}{11}+1,\ \frac{p_{9}\#}{13}+1$ are all primes.

I did first was to make $y$ the subject of the expression, and then I $$xy-7y=4x$$ $$y=\frac{4x}{x-7}$$ $$y=\frac{4}{x-7} * x$$ I started finding the divisors of $4$: $1,2,4$, and setting $x-7$ to be equal to these divisors. I then got the solution pairs: $(8, 32), (9, 18), (11, 11)$. I also realised that if $x-7$ and $x$ were divisible by $7$, then $7$ could be 'cancelled out' from the expression. I substituted $x=14, 21, 35$, and got $3$ more solution pairs: $(14, 8)$, $(21, 6)$, $(35, 5)$. After this, I concluded that there might not be any more solutions, because $$\lim_{x\to \infty} (4*\frac{x}{x-7}) = 4*1=4,$$ and that means that when $x$ is another multiple of $7$, $y$ will never equal $4$. However, how can I prove that there are no other solutions rigorously, without checking each number case by case? Is there a way to find the total number of integer solutions without knowing what they are?","I think I have found all the positive integer solutions to $xy=4x+7y$. I did first was to make $y$ the subject of the expression, and then I $$xy-7y=4x$$ $$y=\frac{4x}{x-7}$$ $$y=\frac{4}{x-7} * x$$ I started finding the divisors of $4$: $1,2,4$, and setting $x-7$ to be equal to these divisors. I then got the solution pairs: $(8, 32), (9, 18), (11, 11)$. I also realised that if $x-7$ and $x$ were divisible by $7$, then $7$ could be 'cancelled out' from the expression. I substituted $x=14, 21, 35$, and got $3$ more solution pairs: $(14, 8)$, $(21, 6)$, $(35, 5)$. After this, I concluded that there might not be any more solutions, because $$\lim_{x\to \infty} (4*\frac{x}{x-7}) = 4*1=4,$$ and that means that when $x$ is another multiple of $7$, $y$ will never equal $4$.

Using a computer it seems that an upper bound on the absolute value looks believable for the variables and . Can we prove this? (It seems that from computer experiments, for , even the bound seems to work; for there is a non-trivial solution ) Motivation : I'm trying to write a computer program to generate such numbers. Having such a bound will mean that I can compute the entire set using simple brute-force algorithm. In my problem there are three more additional constraints: , and .

96,Why is this proof of a congruence relation valid?,Why is this proof of a congruence relation valid?,,"The following question comes from the 2012 Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Open Section), Round 2. Let $p$ be an odd prime. Show that $$1^{p-2}+2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+\dots+\left(\frac{p-1}2\right)^{p-2}=\frac{2-2^p}{p}\pmod p.$$ After trying and failing to find a proof, I went to look at the official solution, which is as follows. Note that for every $k=1,2,\dots,(p-1)/2$ , it is true that $$\frac{2k}p\binom{p}{2k}=\frac{(p-1)(p-2)\dotsm(p-2k+1)}{(2k-1)!}=-1\pmod{p}.$$ Therefore, the LHS is $$\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-2}=-\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-2}\frac{2k}{p}\binom{p}{2k}=-\frac2p\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-1}\binom{p}{2k}=-\frac2p\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}\binom{p}{2k}.$$ The summation in the last equality counts the number of even-sized nonempty subsets of a $p$ -element set, which is $2^{p-1}-1$ . I have a problem with the proof, in the last equality. I know that the proof goes on the idea that $k^{p-1}=1$ for every $k\neq 0$ (Fermat's Little Theorem), but doesn't that mean that we have to work inside $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ , which would make the $-\frac2p$ a division by $0$ ? To illustrate, suppose we claimed that $$\frac{2-2^p}p=\frac2p(1-2^{p-1})=\frac2p(1-1)=0\pmod p.\tag{1}$$ This is of course absurd, because we really have a $0/0$ in the last step, so we are dividing by $0$ . Indeed we can see (for example) that $(2-2^3)/3=-2$ , which is not divisible by $3$ . So when we are working inside $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ , it is not possible to divide by $p=0$ .
