0,Dimension of affine scheme,Dimension of affine scheme,,"I'm reading Eisenbud's ""Geometry of Schemes"" now. In the book, dimension of a scheme $X$ is defined by supremum of local dimension $\dim(X, x)$, where $\dim(X, x)$ is Krull dimension of stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X, x}$. Also, $x$ is ""singular "" if local dimension is strictly smaller than dimension of Zariski (co)tangent space $\mathfrak{m}_{X,x}/\mathfrak{m}_{X, x}^{2}$ over residue field $k(x)=\mathcal{O}_{X, x}/\mathfrak{m}_{X, x}$. Intuitively I understand these definitions, but it was hard for me to compute these. For example, a circle $$X=\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{R}[x, y]/(x^{2}+y^{2}-1)$$ would be nonsingular at all point, especially at $(x-1, y)\in X$. I think that local dimension and dimension of Zariski (co)tangent space will be same as 1, but I failed to compute these. Actually, I can't even convince that residue field at $p=(x-1, y)$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Also, I think that if we consider union of line and circle, $$Y=\mathrm{Spec}\mathbb{R}[x, y]/(y(x^{2}+y^{2}-1))$$ then the point $p$ will be singular and $\dim (Y, p)=1, \dim_{k(p)}\mathfrak{m}_{Y,p}/\mathfrak{m}_{Y, p}^{2}=2$.

1,Compatible germs and the espace étalé,Compatible germs and the espace étalé,,"The following is a confusion I'm having that I cannot find answers to anywhere. If this question has already been asked, I apologise, but I couldn't find any answers after some pretty extensive searching. I know this is four questions, but I think really it's just one (i.e. how do I understand these two concepts in light of each other). After starting to read Vakil's The Rising Sea (which is fantastic, by the way), I have one big confusion. There is the concept of compatible germs and also the concept of the étalé space . They seem very linked, but I can't quite pin down how. Edit: question. In the comments and answers there has been plenty of help with the first and last question, so it's really just the two questions in bold that I'm left with now :) Here's what I've come up with after thinking about this some more, as a more concrete version of the remaining questions (hopefully): we know that taking sections of $p\colon\sqcup_{x\in X}\mathcal{F}_x\to X$ gives us the sheafification of $\mathcal{F}$, as does taking compatible germs. So is there an association between compatible germs and sections $\sigma$ of $p$, e.g. a bijection between the two? Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf (of sets) on a topological space $X$, and $U$ an open set of $X$. Here are some facts/definitions (largely from Vakil's The Rising Sea ): The natural map $\varphi\colon\mathcal{F}(U)\to\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}_x$ is injective. An element $(s_x)_{x\in U}\in\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}_x$ is a collection of compatible germs if any of the following equivalent properties hold: for all $x\in U$ there exists a neighbourhood $U_x\subset U$ and a section $f\in\mathcal{F}(U_x)$ such that for all $y\in U$ we have $s_y=f_y$ (where $f_y$ is the germ of $f$ at $y$); $(s_x)_{x\in U}$ is the image of a section $f$ under the map $\varphi$ (i.e. the above condition holds but with $U_x=U$ for all $x$). The espace étalé $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$ associated to $\mathcal{F}$ (or more generally any pre sheaf) is constructed as follows: as a set, $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})=\coprod_{x\in X}\mathcal{F}_x$; as a topological space, the basis for the open sets of $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$ is given by the $\{V_{U,\,f}\mid U\in\mathsf{Op}(X), f\in\mathcal{F}(U)\}$ where $V_{U,\,f}=(f_x)_{x\in U}$; as an étalé space, the local homeomorphism is given by projection, i.e. $p\colon\Lambda(\mathcal{F})\to X$ acts as $f_x\mapsto x$. The sheaf $\Gamma(p\colon E\to X)$ associated to a continuous map $p\colon E\to X$ acts on open sets as follows: $\Gamma(p\colon E\to X)(U)=\{\sigma\colon U\to E \mid p\circ\sigma=\mathrm{id}_U\}$. Sheafification, which can be constructed by taking only compatible germs, is just $\Gamma\Lambda$. (The last fact is emphasised because it seems to me like it should be the thing that ties everything together.) Questions: Is all of the above correct? How can we think of compatible germs in terms of the étalé space of a (pre)sheaf? I am almost certain that I have read somewhere it is equivalent to the continuity of the sections $\sigma$ or something similar, but I can't find this anywhere. It seems like a collection of germs is compatible if and only if it is open in $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$, but this doesn't sound right to me (or at least not the whole picture), especially when you ask... ... why does the germ map $\varphi$ use the product of sets while the étalé space uses the coproduct? Does this mean we can't link the two concepts? Is there a less confusing notation for elements of $\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}(U)$? Writing $(s_x)_{x\in U}$ always looks to me like we take one section $s$ and look at all of its germs (i.e. compatibility!), but writing something like $(s_x^{(x)})_{x\in U}$ (trying to emphasise that the section that we take the germ of varies with the point we're taking the germ at) seems quite cumbersome (and also something I've never seen!).","The following is a confusion I'm having that I cannot find answers to anywhere.

In section 1.6 of Shafarevich's book, it is detailed how points corresponding to lines in a surface in $\mathbb{P}^3$ are given by a projective subvariety of $\Pi$. The problem I am struggling with asks you to show that points in the Plücker surface corresponding to lines in an irreducible quadric $Q$ over $\mathbb{P}^3$ are given by two disjoint conics.

However, I am having the following issues: (i) I am not sure what the rank of the quadratic form corresponding to an irreducible quadric should be.

I understand that the rank cannot be less than 3 though (2 is a problem because then we have a change of coordinates to $x_0^2+x_1^2$ which is obviously reducible, and 1, well...). (ii) Diagonalizing seems to require a ""Gram-Schmidt"" process using the bilinear form associated with the quadratic form, which only is available for fields with characteristic different from 2, and since Shafarevich does not specify this in his statement of the exercise, this approach to the problem does not work in all cases.

Therefore in my case I can define the $K$-vector space $\Omega^1_{K|k}$ which has dimension $1$. It is often called the ""vect. space of rational differential forms"" . Any element $\omega\in\Omega^1_{K|k} $ defines a divisor $(\omega)$ and for any other $\omega'\in \Omega^1_{K|k}$, we have that $(\omega)\sim(\omega')$.

By a glueing procedure involving $s$, which is well described in Liu's book (Prop. 6.1.17), one can define sheaf of differential forms over $X$ denoted as $\Omega^1_X$ (or $\Omega^1_{X|k}$).

Let's compare the following two constructions: 1. If $B$ be an $A$-algebra, the module of relative differential forms of $B$ over $A$ is a $B$-module $\Omega^1_{B|A}$. Therefore in my case I can define the $K$-vector space $\Omega^1_{K|k}$ which has dimension $1$. It is often called the ""vect. space of rational differential forms"" . Any element $\omega\in\Omega^1_{K|k} $ defines a divisor $(\omega)$ and for any other $\omega'\in \Omega^1_{K|k}$, we have that $(\omega)\sim(\omega')$.

Let $k$ be a field, $X$ a reduced scheme locally of finite type over $k$, $Y$ any $k$-scheme and $f,g\colon X \to Y$ two $k$-morphisms. Then $f=g$ if and only if there exists an algebraically closed field extension $\Omega$ of $k$ such that $f(\Omega)=g(\Omega)\colon X_k(\Omega) \to Y_k(\Omega)$ (i.e., the induced maps on $\Omega$-valued points agree). I know that the statement is true if, in addition, $X$ is required to be geometrically reduced and $Y$ is required to be locally of finite type over $k$ (see ""Background""). I am especially interested in the question whether one can weaken the assumption on $X$ as indicated above. Proof (?): (See ""Background"" for why I suspect a mistake here. My suspecting a mistake is also the reason why I am going to be deliberately verbose.) As the ""only if"" statement is clear, we only have to prove the ""if"" statement. Step 1 (Reduction to the affine case): Let $(V_i)_{i \in I}$ be a cover of $Y$ s.t. all $V_i$ are affine, open subschemes. As $X$ is locally of finite type over $k$ so are all $f^{-1}(V_i)$; we can thus write $f^{-1}(V_i) = \bigcup_{j \in J_i} U_{ij}$, $i \in I$, where the $U_{ij}$ are spectra of finitely generated $k$-algebras. Now for all $i \in I, j \in I_j$, the restriction $g|_{U_{ij}}\colon U_{ij} \to Y$ factors scheme-theoretically through the open subscheme $V_i \subset Y$. Here is why: Let $x \in U_{ij}$ be a closed point; then its residue field $\kappa(x)$ is an algebraic extension of $k$, because $U_{ij}$ is locally of finite type over $k$. By choosing a $k$-embedding $\kappa(x) \hookrightarrow \Omega$ we get an $\Omega$-valued point $x \in (U_{ij})_k(\Omega) \subset X_k(\Omega)$ (abuse of notation) with image $x \in U_{ij}$. Thus, $g \circ x\colon \operatorname{Spec} \Omega \to Y$ is an $\Omega$-valued point of $Y$ with image $g(x)$. But by assumption $$ g \circ x = g(\Omega)(x) = f(\Omega)(x) = f \circ x $$ and the image of $f \circ x$ is $f(x)$ by construction. We have thus seen $g(x) = f(x) \in V_i$ (remember $x \in U_{ij} \subset f^{-1}(V_i)$). From this it follows that $g(U_{ij}) \subset V_i$ (set-theoretically). Indeed, if $x' \in U_{ij}$ is any point, then $x'$ has a specialization $x \in U_{ij}$ that is closed in $U_{ij}$ (e.g. because $U_{ij}$ is affine). Since continuous maps preserve specialization of points, $g(x')$ is a generization of $g(x)$. Since $V_i \subset Y$ is open, $g(x') \in V_i$ now follows from $g(x) \in V_i$; this last assertion was proved above. Finally, from $g(U_{ij}) \subset V_i$ (set-theoretically) it follows that $g|_{U_{ij}}\colon U_{ij} \to Y$ factors scheme-theoretically through the open subscheme $V_i \subset Y$ because $V_i$ is an open subscheme. To conclude step 1: It clearly suffices to show that (abuse of notation) $f|_{U_{ij}} = g|_{U_{ij}}\colon U_{ij} \to V_i$ for all $i, j$. Moreover, all $U_{ij}$ are reduced (as $X$ is) and from $f(\Omega) = g(\Omega)$ it clearly follows that $f|_{U_{ij}}(\Omega) = g|_{U_{ij}}(\Omega): (U_{ij})_k(\Omega) \to (V_i)_k(\Omega)$ for all $i,j$. Step 2 (proof of the affine case): By step 1, it suffices to show the following: Let $B$ be any $k$-algebra. Let $A$ be a finitely generated, reduced $k$-algebra and $\phi, \psi\colon B \to A$ two morphisms of $k$-algebras. Then $\phi = \psi$ if there exists an algebraically closed extension $\Omega$ of $k$ such that $\phi^* = \psi^*\colon \hom_k(A,\Omega) \to \hom_k(B,\Omega)$ (i.e. for all $\sigma \in \hom_k(A,\Omega)$ we have $\sigma \circ \phi = \sigma \circ \psi$). To this end, let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$. Then $A/\mathfrak{m}$ is an algebraic field extension of $k$, because $A$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra. Composing the canonical projection $\pi\colon A \to A/\mathfrak{m}$ with a $k$-embedding $\iota\colon A/\mathfrak{m} \hookrightarrow \Omega$ yields a morphism of $k$-algebras $\iota \circ \pi\colon A \to \Omega$. By assumption we have $\iota \circ \pi \circ \phi = \iota \circ \pi \circ \psi$; since $\iota$ is injective, we get $\pi \circ \phi = \pi \circ \psi$. We have just seen: $\forall b \in B : \phi(b) - \psi(b) \in \bigcap_{\mathfrak{m} \subset A} \mathfrak{m}$, where the intersection is taken over all maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ of $A$. But since a finitely generated $k$-algebra is Jacobson, this intersection $\bigcap_{\mathfrak{m} \subset A} \mathfrak{m}$ is just the nilradical of $A$. Since $A$ was assumed to be reduced, $\phi = \psi$ follows. Background: I have frequently come across variants of the statement in question requiring stronger assumptions on $X$ or $Y$. For example, exercise 5.16 in the book Algebraic Geometry I by Görtz and Wedhorn asks you to prove the following: Let $k$ be a field, let $X$ and $Y$ be $k$-schemes locally of finite type, and let $f,g\colon X \to Y$ be two $k$-morphisms.

Then $f=g$ if and only if there exists an algebraically closed extension $\Omega$ of $k$ such that $f$ and $g$ induce the same map $X_k(\Omega) \to Y_k(\Omega)$ on $\Omega$-valued points. See also here , here and here on Math.SE. In particular, I am aware that this answer gives 'an example showing why ""geometrically reduced"" is necessary for the result to hold' - but as far as I can see, in the example given there, $X$ is not even reduced. While I can see why one would not care whether $Y$ is assumed to be locally of finite type or just any $k$-scheme, I am puzzled by $X$ constantly being required to be geometrically reduced. On the other hand, I have the admittedly naive intuition that being geometrically reduced is the ""correct"" requirement if you want to capitalize on another assumption involving an algebraic closure. This is why I am not fully convinced by the above prove (which is the first one I came up with in approaching the stated exericse in Görtz-Wedhorn - only later I realized that it seems to require $X$ to be only reduced).

I'm fairly happy with the number theory side of things (torsions, rank, whatever) but is my understanding of the more geometric/topoological side correct? It is well known that an elliptic curve (smooth plane cubic) is equivalent, via the Weierstrass function, to a complex torus, that is, $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ for some non-degenerate lattice $\Lambda=\omega_1\mathbb{Z}+\omega_2\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\omega_1/\omega_2\notin \mathbb{R}$.

The paths here are the two path independent ways in the torus -- i.e. one loops 'around' the middle hole and one loops 'through' the hole. The integrals can also be expressed as elliptic integrals integrating between the roots of the RHS of $y^2=x^3+ax+b$. Now my question is how does this all generalise to curves of genus 2?
