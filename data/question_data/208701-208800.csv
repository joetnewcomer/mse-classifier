Prove by mathematical induction that for every integer n $\ge$ 0,  $12\mid8^{2n+1}+2^{4n+2}$ I start out by proving the base case, $F(0)$, to be true: $$ F(0)=8^1+2^2=12\quad \text{Obviously, 12 is divisible by 12} $$ I then move on to the induction step to prove the $F(n+1)$ is true: I assume that $8^{2n+1}+2^{4n+2}$ is divisible by 12, and then plug in $(n+1)$: $$ F(n+1)=8^{2(n+1)+1}+2^{4(n+1)+2}=8^{2n+3}+2^{4n+6} $$ I then do $F(n+1)-F(n)$: $$ F(n+1)-F(n)=(8^{2n+3}+2^{4n+6})-(8^{2n+1}+2^{4n+2}) $$ $$ =8^{2n+3}-8^{2n+1}+2^{4n+6}-2^{4n+2} $$ I then factor out the terms used in $F(n)$: $$ 8^{2n+1}(8^2-1)+2^{4n+2}(2^4-1)=8^{2n+1}(63)+2^{4n+2}(15) $$ I can re-write the result as: $$ 8^{2n+1}(63)+2^{4n+2}(12+3) $$ This is where I'm stuck. I broke up the $15$ into $12+3$ since I need to prove that there is a multiple of 12, but I don't know what to do with the 63, since (I think) you're supposed to have the terms in $F(n)$ multiplied by 3 after you distribute so that you can factor out the 3 and have $F(n)$ in the equation, which is proven to be divisible by 12.

98,Proof by induction that $(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3+\cdots+n^3) = (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2$ [duplicate],Proof by induction that  [duplicate],(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3+\cdots+n^3) = (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2,"This question already has answers here : Proving $1^3+ 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$ using induction (16 answers) Closed 9 years ago . I'm sitting with the proof in front of me, but I do not understand it. $$A = \{n \in Z^{++} \mid (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3+\cdots+n^3) = (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2\}$$ The first step of proof by induction is simple enough,to prove that $1 \in A$ $1^3 = 1^2$ The next step is where I get tripped up. So I add $n + 1$ to the right hand side $$(1 + 2 + \cdots + n + (n + 1))^2 = (1 + 2 + \cdots + n)^2 + 2(1 + 2 + \cdots + n)(n + 1) + (n + 1)^2$$ My algebra is failing me here, because I do not understand how the equation was expanded.","This question already has answers here : Proving $1^3+ 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$ using induction (16 answers) Closed 9 years ago .

99,Prove that n!+1 contains a prime factor greater than n and use this to prove that there are infinte many primes,Prove that n!+1 contains a prime factor greater than n and use this to prove that there are infinte many primes,,"Prove that $n!+1$ contains a prime factor greater than $n$ and use this to prove that there are infinitely many primes. I said assume that $n!+1$ contains a prime $p$ which is less than or equal to $n$. So $p \leq n$, therefore $p \mid n!+1$, so $p$ has to divide $n!$ and $p \mid 1$. However since $p$ can't divide 1, we contradicted ourselves, so $n!+1$ must contain a prime greater than 1. I don't know how to prove that there are infinitely many primes, and I'm not quite sure that my solution I gave above is correct.","Prove that $n!+1$ contains a prime factor greater than $n$ and use this to prove that there are infinitely many primes.
