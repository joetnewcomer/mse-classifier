1,Direct proof that $\sum_{x=1}^n \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} \frac{1}{x(n-y)} = \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{1}{x^2}$,Direct proof that,\sum_{x=1}^n \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} \frac{1}{x(n-y)} = \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{1}{x^2},"I'm looking for a direct proof that for all $n\in \mathbb N$ , $$\sum_{x=1}^n \sum_{y=0}^{x-1} \frac{1}{x(n-y)} = \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{1}{x^2}.$$ It is easy to prove this relation by induction on $n$ , but I'm struggling to find a direct proof. The relation is so simple that it feels like there should be a short non-inductive proof, potentially using other well-known identities. Note that subtracting $\left(\sum_{x=1}^n \frac 1 x\right)^2$ from both side, the relation is equivalent to $$\sum_{x=1}^n \sum_{y=1}^{n-x} \frac{1}{xy}=\sum_{1\leq x\ne y \leq n} \frac{1}{xy}.$$ So a direct proof of this latter equality would also be sufficient.","I'm looking for a direct proof that for all , It is easy to prove this relation by induction on , but I'm struggling to find a direct proof.

Starting at the any term in a set, when the next term is added to the 'tally', the second term is subtracted from the first if the result is nonnegative, otherwise it is added to the tally. Then the third term is subtracted from the strange sum if the result is nonnegative, otherwise it is added to the 'strange sum'. Repeat the process. For example, the 'strange sum' of the sequence $1, 3, 4, 2, 5$ is $1+3-4+2+5=7$ Suppose there is a list of numbers from $1$ to $100$ in some order. What is the largest possible 'strange sum'? I couldn't find any clear pattern. However, I did notice that if the sum of the first $99$ terms is $99$ , then $100$ can be added, hence making the total sum $199$ . Any thoughts on this problem? (edit) I just realised that $199$ is impossible as the sum of the first $99$ natural numbers is even and so it would be impossible to achieve a 'strange sum' of $99$ . That would mean that $198$ is the next highest possibility. $98$ is achievable via the 'strange sum' by the first $99$ natural numbers in some order, though I still have not been able to constitute a proof for $198$ .","I came across this problem the other day.

Looking at each sequence separately, they look quite messy and are not monotone and also don't seem to converge to a limit. I have tried an induction method, to start from $x_{n+1} + y_{n+1} + z_{n+1}$ , expand out using the recursion, and try to show that it is non-zero provided that $x_n+y_n+z_n$ is non-zero, but I am not getting anywhere because it is too messy. Maybe it can be simplified to showing that $x_n + y_n > z_n$ for all $n$ or something along those lines which will be sufficient to prove the result. Alternatively, I think it would be neater to find some invariant but I am really bad at finding invariants and I don't see any clue on how to start. The most obvious $x_n +y_n + z_n$ is not constant so that doesn't work. Another thing maybe is to look at the sequence of numerators and denominators i.e. let $a_n/b_n = x_n$ where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are coprime and work from there but it also gets messy very quickly.

20,Uniform Convergence Weierstrass' M-Test,Uniform Convergence Weierstrass' M-Test,,"Could you correct my following proof for the uniform convergence of the Weierstrass' M-Test? At first, I'm going to write the preconditions: We have a sequence of complex functions $(a_n(z))_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0}$ with $|a_n(z)|\leq M_n$ for $z \in  K \subset \mathbb{C}$ and $\sum_{n=0}^\infty M_n < \infty$ . This implies that $L(z)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(z)$ is uniformly convergent (which means that for all $z \in K$ there is an $\epsilon >0$ and $m_0>0$ such that $|L(z)-\sum_{n=0}^{m} a_n(z)|<\epsilon$ , $m\geq m_0$ , $z \in K$ .) I have to show this following two steps: 1) The series is uniformly cauchy, i.e. there is an $\epsilon >0$ and $m_0$ such that $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2} a_n(z) - \sum_{n=0}^{M_1} a_j(z)|<\epsilon$ , $M_2>M_1\geq m_0$ , $z \in K$ . 2) Given the existence of the Limit of the partial sums, show that we get the uniform convergence of the partial sums. Now I am going to present my ideas: For step 1): I already proved that the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(z)$ converges absolutely. And therefore, it converges. My idea is: Let $s(z)$ be the limit of the series. Then for all $\epsilon>0$ there is an $m_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)-s(z)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2}a_n(z)-s(z)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for all $M_2,M_1\geq m_0$ . And then it follows that $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2} a_n(z) - \sum_{n=0}^{M_1} a_j(z)|=|\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)-s(z)+s(z)-\sum_{n=0}^{M_2}a_n(z)|\leq  |\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)-s(z)|+|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2}a_n(z)-s(z)|< \frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$ . Is this correct? For step 2): By convergence of the series we know that for all $\epsilon>0$ there is an $m_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)-s(z)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ for all $M_1>m_0$ . By step 1) we know that for all $\epsilon$ is an $m_0$ gibt such that $|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2} a_n(z) - \sum_{n=0}^{M_1} a_j(z)|<\epsilon$ for all $M_2>M_1\geq m_0$ . Hence, we get: $|s(z)-\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)|\leq |s(z)-\sum_{n=0}^{M_2}a_n(z)|+|\sum_{n=0}^{M_2}a_n(z)-\sum_{n=0}^{M_1}a_n(z)|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}+\frac{\epsilon}{2}=\epsilon$ Is this correct?

So what are your thoughts on this? What will be a good expression that could take in the $x$ value and give a good approximate? I'm got a formula, a crude, anecdotal that could give a value close to what is got. I'll post it soon after a few modifications. EDIT Some observations that I did. $$n ≈ \frac{x}{10}\tag{1}\label{1}$$ Or I can say that for a $x$ , the $n$ value is; (Big thanks to @glowstonetrees for an inspiration.) $$n≈9*10^{m−3}\tag{2}\label{2}$$ Where $m$ is the no. of digits of $x$ . But we know $x$ is the no. of digits of the given $x$ -digit value. So $m$ is like no. of digits of the no. of digits of $x$ -digit integer Now for my own anecdotal estimate of this; $$n≈\pi^{2\left(\log\left(x\right)-1\right)}\tag{3}\label{3}$$ The reason I chose log is that it is a ""slow-moving"" function so it doesn't change rapidly.

Consider this random 100-digit integer that I generated using random.org This number will most likely have upto in them. But when we further look into we can also find , (i.e then right after) and also . But there's no in them (i.e no then a right after). So what I want to find out is what will be the approximation of , such that there will be integers that can be seen inside a random x-digit. Also note that can never be found in a random x-digit. If you say that the 'n' value will change randomly and there cannot be any asymptotic or approximations of that. You're kind of wrong. See, I did this with 9 other random 100-digit numbers and also the 100 decimal places of the famous constants and . The results are pretty close to . Here are them; (scroll right to see the corresponding ) Now take the average of all the n-values and you'll get , for I'm starting to work on and for a hint or and this is just like approximate value of an approximate value, I'll find a good approximate value soon. So what are your thoughts on this? What will be a good expression that could take in the value and give a good approximate? I'm got a formula, a crude, anecdotal that could give a value close to what is got. I'll post it soon after a few modifications. EDIT Some observations that I did. Or I can say that for a , the value is; (Big thanks to @glowstonetrees for an inspiration.) Where is the no. of digits of . But we know is the no. of digits of the given -digit value. So is like no. of digits of the no. of digits of -digit integer Now for my own anecdotal estimate of this; The reason I chose log is that it is a ""slow-moving"" function so it doesn't change rapidly.

The integral is always real, so I am sure there is a major way we can simplify $\Gamma_{n,k}$ , but I have been so far unable to find it. I do suspect however that the product $$P_n=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{n,k}$$ May play a significant role in finding the simplification I seek. For those interested, a proof. Note that $x^n+1$ bay be factored as $$x^n+1=\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,k})$$ Hence $$\phi(n)=\int_0^1\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac1{x-\lambda_{n,k}}dx$$ Then define $\Gamma_{n,k}$ by saying that $$\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac1{x-\lambda_{n,k}}=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\Gamma_{n,k}}{x-\lambda_{n,k}}$$ Multiplying both sides by $\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$ : $$1=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\frac{\Gamma_{n,k}}{x-\lambda_{n,k}}\prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$$ $$1=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\Gamma_{n,k}\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}(x-\lambda_{n,j})$$ So for any integer $0\leq m\leq n-1$ we may plug in $x=\lambda_{n,m}$ and simplify to get $$\Gamma_{n,m}=\prod_{m\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{\lambda_{n,m}-\lambda_{n,j}}$$ And our result follows directly. Perhaps another motivation for easing manual calculation of this product would be that $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^k}{nk+1}=\phi(n)$$ Which brings about a plethora of interesting closed forms. Edit: A little progress We define $$c_{n,j}=\operatorname{Re}\lambda_{n,j}=\cos\frac{\pi(2j+1)}{n}$$ And $$s_{n,j}=\operatorname{Im}\lambda_{n,j}=\sin\frac{\pi(2j+1)}{n}$$ So $$\log\frac{\lambda_{n,k}-1}{\lambda_{n,k}}=\log\left(1-\lambda_{n,k}^{-1}\right)=\log\left(1-c_{n,k}+is_{n,k}\right)$$ And we also see that $$\begin{align} \prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{\lambda_{n,k}-\lambda_{n,j}}&=\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac1{e^{i\pi(2k+1)/n}-e^{i\pi(2j+1)/n}}\\ &=\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac{e^{-i\pi(2k+1)/n}}{1-e^{i\pi(2j-2k)/n}}\\ &=e^{i(2k+1)(2-n)/n}\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\frac12\left(1+i\cot\frac{\pi(j-k)}n\right)\\ \Gamma_{n,k}&=\frac{\lambda_{n,k}^{2-n}}{2^{n-2}}\prod_{k\neq j=0}^{n-1}\left(1+i\cot\frac{\pi(j-k)}n\right) \end{align}$$ But the remaining product I do not know how to deal with.","I have been able to show that for Where And And I was wondering: how do we simplify to ease the manual calculation of values.

42,Are my calculations of a recursive prime-generating function based on logarithms correct?,Are my calculations of a recursive prime-generating function based on logarithms correct?,,"I am trying to devise a recursive prime-generating function following an intuition of a possible analogy to Mills and Wright prime-representing functions, in the present case based on logarithms. The proposed prime generating function $f(n)$ will provide not a subset but the complete set of primes being $f(1)=2$, $f(2)=3$, $f(3)=5$... and the prime-generating constant will be called $L$. As in the standard results from Mills and Wright the decimal precision of the constant is important in order to recover the embedded primes and it is not known if    $\lim_{n \to \infty} L_n$ is rational or not. This is how it works and the questions are at the end: Start with $n=1$, current prime $p_1=2$, previous accumulated value of the constant will be defined as $L_0=0$ (starting value). Calculate the value for the constant for $n=1$. It will be $$L_1=\frac{Ln(2+L_0)}{Ln(1+1)}$$ (Where $Ln$ is the natural logarithm). Calculate the value for the constant for $n=2$, $p_2=3$, $$L_2=\frac{Ln(3+L_1)}{Ln(2+1)}$$ So if we apply recursively the formula, for $n$: $$L_n=\frac{Ln(p_n+L_{n-1})}{Ln(n+1)}$$ For instance, the following PARI_GP code calculates $L_{500}$ \p2000; testlimit=500;current_pr=2;L=0;for(n=1,testlimit,L=log(current_pr+L)/log(n+1);current_pr=nextprime(current_pr+1););print(""n is "",testlimit,"" and L is "",L); $$L_{500} = 1.3159864456...$$ Reviewing the results of the tests, it seems that $\lim_{n \to \infty} L_n$  oscillates (due to the gaps between primes applied in the formula) but in the long term it is stable and tends to decrease and goes down to a value closer to $1$ and lower than $2$. For example: \p3; testlimit=500000;current_pr=2;L=0;for(n=2,testlimit,L=log(current_pr+L)/log(n);current_pr=nextprime(current_pr+1););print(""n is "",testlimit,"" and L is "",L); $L_{5000}$ is around $1.23...$ and the above code shows that $L_{500000}$ is around $1.21$. Other similar tests show that it tends to go down to some specific limit near the lower bound of $[1,2]$. As the proccess of recovering the primes is recursive, the way of using the constant is as follows: For instance, assuming that we have $L_{500}$, we need to start obtaining the last prime back: $$f(500)=p_{500}=\lfloor (500+1)^{L_{500}} \rfloor - 1 = 3571$$ Then recover $L_{499}$ and recover $f(499)=p_{499}$ $$L_{499}=((500+1)^{L_{500}})-p_{500}=1.31586811...$$ $$f(499)=p_{499}=\lfloor (499+1)^{L_{499}} \rfloor - 1 = 3559$$ $$...$$ So in general the recursive process to recover $L_{n}$ and $f(n)=p_n$ from $L_{n+1}$ and $f(n+1)=p_{n+1}$ is: $$L_{n}=((n+2)^{L_{n+1}})-p_{n+1}$$ $$f(n)=p_{n}=\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor - 1$$ The following code, having $L_{500}$ calculates backwards the complete set of primes $\{p_{500}..p_{1}\}$ curr_L=L;for(n=1,testlimit,curr_n=testlimit-n+2;curr_p=(floor(curr_n^curr_L))-1;print(""n is "",testlimit-n+1,"" ; Current prime is "",curr_p,"" and is_prime check = "",isprime(curr_p));curr_L=(curr_n^curr_L)-curr_p;); There is a little correction required for the calculation of $p_1$. Depending on the $L_n$ calculated, sometimes the recovered value $\lfloor (2)^{L_{1}} \rfloor = 2$ instead of $3$. And for that reason, when the value is $2$, $f(1)=p_{1}=\lfloor (2)^{L_{1}} \rfloor - 1 = 2-1 = 1$ instead of the expected $p_1=2$. To handle this special case, we can express the prime-generating function as: $$f(n)=p_{n}=\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor - 1 + \delta_{f(n),2}$$ Where $\delta_{f(n),2}$ is the Kronecker delta function (kindly provided by @MitchellSpector in this question ). Basically it is a little trick that will assure that always $f(1)=2$ independently of the value of $\lfloor (n+1)^{L_{n}} \rfloor$ ($2$ or $3$). It would be possible a definitions-by-case of $f(n)$ as well instead of using one single expression. This is a graph of the evolution of $L_n$ (only four decimals of precision): I would like to ask the following questions: Are the calculations correct or is there a mistake in the assumptions? How could I prove that $L_n$ is decreasing in the long term and    there is indeed a limit? The tests show that but I am a little bit lost about   how to demonstrate that it really is decreasing (because each step depends   on the gaps between primes).

Let's consider the following series: $$\mathscr S:=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\prod_{\substack{k=0 \\ \ln^{(k)}(n)\geqslant 1}}^{\infty} \ln^{(k)}(n)\right)^{-1},$$ where the apparently infinite product is in fact finite for all $k$ .

I solved this by calculating ${ S }_{ 1 },{ S }_{ 2 },{ S }_{ 3 },...\\ $ until I had a close enough value (bad method, I know). Anyway, here is the solution steps given in the answer: Note that this is a convergent alternating series. The Alternating Series Estimation Theorem states that the error bound in the sum of the first $n$ terms is the absolute value of the first omitted term; i.e., $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| $. To obtain three-digit accuracy, we need to find $n$ such that $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| <\ 0.0005$, or equivalently $\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } <0.0005$. When $n=6$, we have $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| =\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } =\frac { 9 }{ 16807 } \approx .000535$; that is not accurate enough. When $n=7$, we have $\left| { a }_{ n+1 } \right| =\frac { n+3 }{ { (n+1) }^{ 5 } } =\frac { 10 }{ 32768 } \approx .000305$; that will give a final result within $0.0005$.

52,Deriving topology from sequence convergence/limits?,Deriving topology from sequence convergence/limits?,,"Normally convergence of a series and the limit of a convergent series are defined relative to a topology. That is, you start with a topology, and then you define a series as convergent based on that topology, using the well known definition: A series $(a_n)$ converges to $a$ if for every neighbourhood $N$ of $a$ there's an $m\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n>m$, $a_n\in N$. Now I'm thinking about whether it is possible to reverse that process: Start with a declaration which series are divergent, and what is the limit of all convergent series, and then use that to define a topology, by simply reversing the above definition: A set $N$ is a neighbourhood of a point $a$ if for every series $(a_n)$ converging to $a$ there exists an $m\in\mathbb N$ such that for all $n>m$, $a_n\in N$. More formally, a limit function for a set $M$ would be defined as a function $$ l: \mathbb N^M \to M\cup \{\text{divergent}\}$$ mapping all sequences of values in $M$ either to a value in $M$ (saying that the value converges to that value) or to the special value $\text{divergent}\notin M$ (saying that the sequence is divergent, of course). That function, to be considered a limit, would of course have to fulfil some requirements to count as limit functions. I think an obvious set of conditions would be: For the constant sequence $(a) = (a,a,a,a,a,\ldots)$, $l((a)) = a$. If $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ differ in only finitely many terms, then $l((a_n))=l((b_n))$. If $(b_n)$ is a subsequence of $(a_n)$ and $(a_n)$ converges, then $l((b_n)) = l((a_n))$. If $c_n$ is obtained by interleaving $a_n$ and $b_n$ (where the interleaving may be in any possible way) then $$l((c_n)) = \begin{cases}l((a_n)) & \text{if } l((a_n))=l((b_n))\\ \text{divergent} & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$ Of course what remains to be shown is whether the definition above indeed results in a neighbourhood topology.
