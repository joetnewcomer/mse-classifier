2,Does a weak solution to the geodesic equations coincide with a strong solution?,Does a weak solution to the geodesic equations coincide with a strong solution?,,"Suppose $u^\alpha$ ( $\alpha = 0, 1, 2, 3$ ) is a weak solution to the geodesic equations $u^\alpha(t, x) \partial_\alpha u^\beta(t, x) = -\Gamma^\beta_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu$ .

9,Hodge star without a metric,Hodge star without a metric,,"The standard definition of the Hodge star is as follows: the Hodge dual of a differential $p$ -form defined on an $n$ dimensional manifold $M$ , $\alpha \in \Omega^p(M)$ , is the unique form $\star \alpha \in \Omega^{(n-p)}(M)$ that satisfies \begin{equation} \beta \wedge \star \alpha = \langle \beta, \alpha \rangle \omega \end{equation} for any differential $p$ -form $\beta$ . Of course, implicit in this definition, there is a choice of metric on $M$ , which induces an inner product on $p$ -forms, as well as a choice of volume form $\omega$ , although from what I gather this tends to be taken to be the volume form induced by the metric. The Hodge dual is then an isomorphism $\star \colon \Omega^p(M) \to \Omega^{n-p}(M)$ , which reflects the fact that these spaces have the same dimension. I noticed, however, that really the Hodge star is built out of two steps: the choice of a volume form gives you an isomorphism between $(n-p)$ -forms and $p$ -vector fields, and the choice of a metric gives an isomorphism between $p$ -vector fields and $p$ -forms. I worked through the details in the case $p=1$ . First, given a volume form $\omega$ , we have what one could call a primitive Hodge star, $\ast \colon \Gamma(TM) \to \Omega^{n-1}(M)$ which is just an interior product: $\ast X = \iota_X \omega$ .

Of course, implicit in this definition, there is a choice of metric on , which induces an inner product on -forms, as well as a choice of volume form , although from what I gather this tends to be taken to be the volume form induced by the metric. The Hodge dual is then an isomorphism , which reflects the fact that these spaces have the same dimension. I noticed, however, that really the Hodge star is built out of two steps: the choice of a volume form gives you an isomorphism between -forms and -vector fields, and the choice of a metric gives an isomorphism between -vector fields and -forms. I worked through the details in the case . First, given a volume form , we have what one could call a primitive Hodge star, which is just an interior product: .

And I am kind of stuck in understanding the last part of a proof in such book. Currently we are trying to prove Proposition 5.4.5. If a critical point of $H$ is nondegenerate as a periodic solution of the Hamiltonian system, then it is nondegenerate as a critical point of the function $H$ . (Screenshot here) So, part of the proof is here Computed at the critical point $x$ of $H$ , the first term is zero and the second one is exactly $$ \left(d^{2} H\right)_{x}\left(X_{f}(x), Z(x)\right)=\left(d^{2} H\right)_{x}(Y, Z) $$ We now suppose that $x$ is nondegenerate as a trajectory of $X_{H}$ . This means that for every $Z \neq 0$ , we have $$ T_{x} \psi^{1}(Z)-Z \neq 0. $$ (Screenshot here) My main question is in page 138. So it says that $$\frac{d}{dt} T_x \psi^{t}(Z) = T_x \psi^{t} ([X_H, Z])$$ I do not understand where this equality comes from. I have been trying to see if this is a known property of time-dependent flows, but no success until now. Here $X_H$ denotes the time-dependent Hamiltonian vector field. Here is the things I have tried until now: In the appendix of such book it is known that for time-dependent flows we have that $\frac{dY}{dt} = (dX_t)_{x(t)}Y$ iff $Y(t) = T_{x(t)}\psi^{t}(Y(0))$ , where $X_t$ is any time-dependent vector field. So, we can apply this to our case where $X_t = X_H$ , but after that I am not sure how to go from $(dX_H)_{x(t)}Y$ to $T_x \psi^{t}([X_H, Z])$ . The other thing that I tried to imitate was the fact that for time-dependent vector fields we get a formula for $\frac{d}{dt} \psi^{*} Y_{t}$ , where it is very similar with what I want, but at the end this formula is for the pullback of my flow $\psi$ and I want a formula for the push-forward.

16,Homotopy of integral curves of a gradient field preserves levelsets (?),Homotopy of integral curves of a gradient field preserves levelsets (?),,"Given a differentiable scalar field $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ (with properties as required) I would like to formulate a homotopy of maximal integral curves $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ of the gradient field $\nabla f$ . Edit : If $X$ has a boundary, i.e. $\partial X \neq \emptyset$ then $f$ shall obey the Neumann boundary condition $g(\mathbf{n}, \nabla f) = 0$ on $ \partial X$ with $\mathbf{n}$ denoting the outward-pointing normal and $g$ the Riemannian metric. I assume the term ""maximal integral curve"" as defined in http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/diffgeomPage/handouts/intcurve.pdf , Theorem 5.1. Edit : For the constructions below I mainly care about the images of $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ so I allow for an arbitrary parametrization of the curves, even if this parametrization does not strictly coincide with the gradient any more (i.e. not in terms of absolute value, but just in terms of direction). Then, without loss of generality, let $\gamma, \tilde{\gamma}$ be parameterized over the unit interval $I$ . Then I mean in particular a homotopy $H$ : \begin{align} \tag{1} H(\,\cdot\,, 0) \quad &= \quad \gamma \\ H(\,\cdot\,, 1) \quad &= \quad \tilde{\gamma} \tag{2}\\ \forall t \in I \colon \; H(\,\cdot\,, t) \quad & \text{is a maximal integral curve of $\nabla f$} \tag{3} \end{align} The requirement of the intermediate states being also maximal integral curves is not usual for a homotopy AFAIK. Also it would not necessarily require the end points of each curve to be the same. First bunch of questions: Is $H$ then actually a homotopy or should I call it rather an isotopy or how else? What would be the proper terminology for this definition? Now what I need is that all curves that are homotopic to an initial maximal integral curve $\gamma_0$ in this sense cross the same level sets of $f$ in the same order. Formally: For every $\gamma$ homotopic to $\gamma_0$ in sense (1)/(2)/(3) there exists a homeomorphism (a reparametrization) $\psi \colon I \longrightarrow I$ such that \begin{equation} \tag{4} f \circ \gamma = f \circ \gamma_0 \circ \psi \end{equation} This seems like a triviality as a levelset cannot abruptly end unless it contains critical points of $f$ . But at critical points the maximal integral curves of $\nabla f$ would end and a homotopy could not be continued in first place. Integral curves of $\nabla f$ must cross a level set orthogonally which would not be defined at the boundary of the level set. Second bunch of questions: Is there a more formal argument for this or a known theorem yielding this? Or how would I prove it? Or do I even overlook something and there is a counter example? Given an initial maximal integral curve $\gamma_0$ I suppose there is a well-defined subset $U_0$ of the manifold $X$ consisting of points that lie on any integral curve that is homotopic to $\gamma_0$ in the sense of (1)/(2)/(3). I further suppose that $X$ can be split into disjoint regions $U_j$ in this manner. I.e. such that each region consists of points lying on an integral curve homotopic to an initial integral curve $\gamma_j$ but $\gamma_j$ not homotopic to $\gamma_i$ for $i \neq j$ in sense of (1)/(2)/(3). Third bunch of questions: Is there a proper terminology for this construction, e.g. ""homotopy regions"" of $\nabla f$ or something (maybe related to the ""domain of flow"" from the lecture notes linked above)? Is there a reason to assume that $X$ splits into a finite or at least countable number of these regions $U_j$ ? I guess $X$ would have to be something like a fractal to yield an infinite number of such regions. Final bunch of questions: At the top I wrote ""with properties as required"". What properties are required to make the constructions in this question reasonable? I would prefer to not require $X$ to be compact or bounded, nor to expect that the maximal integral curves would be complete. Further I would like to have this for manifolds with or without boundary. Is that feasible? Does $X$ have to be orientable? Edit: I realized this may require some more regularity assumptions on $f$ . In my use case, $f$ arises as a solution of an elliptic differential equation, thus it should obey a unique continuation property, i.e. $\nabla f$ would not vanish on an open set. $\nabla f$ would vanish almost nowhere on $X$ . I am not sure if $f$ can be assumed to be analytic or if $X$ can. However, $f$ should be twice continuously differentiable as the differential equation is second order. Further, I suppose one can only have finitely many $U_j$ if the set of critical points of $f$ consist only of finitely many connectivity components. I am not sure what role it would play whether $X$ is bounded or not.

Edit : If has a boundary, i.e. then shall obey the Neumann boundary condition on with denoting the outward-pointing normal and the Riemannian metric. I assume the term ""maximal integral curve"" as defined in http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/diffgeomPage/handouts/intcurve.pdf , Theorem 5.1. Edit : For the constructions below I mainly care about the images of so I allow for an arbitrary parametrization of the curves, even if this parametrization does not strictly coincide with the gradient any more (i.e. not in terms of absolute value, but just in terms of direction). Then, without loss of generality, let be parameterized over the unit interval . Then I mean in particular a homotopy : The requirement of the intermediate states being also maximal integral curves is not usual for a homotopy AFAIK. Also it would not necessarily require the end points of each curve to be the same. First bunch of questions: Is then actually a homotopy or should I call it rather an isotopy or how else? What would be the proper terminology for this definition? Now what I need is that all curves that are homotopic to an initial maximal integral curve in this sense cross the same level sets of in the same order. Formally: For every homotopic to in sense (1)/(2)/(3) there exists a homeomorphism (a reparametrization) such that This seems like a triviality as a levelset cannot abruptly end unless it contains critical points of . But at critical points the maximal integral curves of would end and a homotopy could not be continued in first place. Integral curves of must cross a level set orthogonally which would not be defined at the boundary of the level set.

17,Result of Parallel transport along geodesic on $U(n)$,Result of Parallel transport along geodesic on,U(n),"I am reading this paper Conjugate Gradient Algorithm for Optimization Under Unitary Matrix Constraint . It basically describes a variant of the conjugate gradient method when optimizing for unitary matrices which takes advantage of the Lie group structure of $U(n)$ . The question however is basic differential geometry and maybe Lie theory and this is what I am struggling with. Specifically, the following is stated: Now, the parallel transport of a tangent vector $\tilde{X} = XW \in T_W U(n) , X \in  \mathfrak{u}(n)$ , w.r.t. the Riemannian connection along the geodesic $$ \mathcal{G}_W (t) = \exp(tS) W,\quad S\in \mathfrak{u}(n), \quad t\in \mathbb{R} \tag{1}$$ is given by $$\tau \tilde{X}(t) = \exp(tS/2) \; X \; \exp(−tS/2) \;G_W(t) \tag{2} $$ where $\tau$ denotes the parallel transport. Here, $\mathfrak{u}(n) $ denotes the Lie algebra to $U(n)$ and the geodesic $\mathcal{G}_W(t)$ is such that it emanates from $W$ in the direction of the vector $(dR_W)_e(S)=SW \in T_WU(n)$ . I should further note that $U(n)$ was equipped with a bi-invariant metric! My questions: From the formula of the geodesic $\mathcal{G}_W(t)$ , it seems to be that one can transport every vector on the Lie group just by left/right translation to every point. This seems much more natural than parallel transport. In the case of a bi-invariant metric, does it differ from parallel transport (which I understand depends on the geometry crucially) Could someone walk me trough how one obtains the formula for the parallel transport, namely (2)? In particular, this actually looks a like a right translation of the vector $\exp(tS/2) \; X \; \exp(−tS/2)$ ,  too, i.e. $$ \tau \tilde{X}(t) = dR_{G_W(t)}\left(\exp(tS/2) \; X \; \exp(−tS/2)\right) \tag{3} $$ and the thing in the bracket is somehow the adjoint map but I still cannot puzzle these things together.","I am reading this paper Conjugate Gradient Algorithm for Optimization Under Unitary Matrix Constraint .

(I'm actually proving a version of the result restricted to geodesic variations, because that's what I'm primarily interested in.) Note: I have seen the proof done with local coordinates, e.g., in John M. Lee's book; I want to avoid using coordinates. Let $\gamma : [0,T] \to M$ be a geodesic in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, and let $\sigma : (-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \times [0,T] \to M$, $(s,t) \mapsto \sigma(s,t)$ be a smooth geodesic variation of $\gamma$ (i.e., $\sigma(0,\cdot) = \gamma$, and $\sigma(s,\cdot)$ is a geodesic for every $s$). We can define vector fields along $\sigma$ as follows: $$   J(s,t) = T_{(s,t)}\sigma\cdot\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\right|_{(s,t)}          =: \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial s}(s,t)  \quad\text{and}\quad   Z(s,t) = T_{(s,t)}\sigma\cdot\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right|_{(s,t)}          =: \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial t}(s,t). $$ (Here $s$ is the coordinate on $(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)$, and $t$ is that on $[0,T]$.)

Proof : Let $\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z} \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ be (smooth) extensions of $J$ and $Z$, resp., to an open neighbourhood of $\sigma$, i.e., $\widetilde{J}(\sigma(s,t)) = J(s,t)$ and $\widetilde{Z}(\sigma(s,t)) = Z(s,t)$. Since $\partial/\partial s$ and $\widetilde{J}$ are $\sigma$-related, likewise $\partial/\partial t$ and $\widetilde{Z}$, we then get that $$   [\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z}]\circ\sigma     = T\sigma\cdot\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial s},\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right]     = 0. $$ Thus, since the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ is symmetric: \begin{align*}   0 & = T(J(s,t),Z(s,t))\\     & = T(\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z})(\sigma(s,t))\\     & = \nabla_{\widetilde{J}}\widetilde{Z}(\sigma(s,t)) - \nabla_{\widetilde{Z}}\widetilde{J}(\sigma(s,t)) - [\widetilde{J},\widetilde{Z}](\sigma(s,t))\\     & = \nabla_{J(s,t)}(\widetilde{Z}\circ\sigma) - \nabla_{Z(s,t)}(\widetilde{J}\circ\sigma)\\       & = \frac{D}{ds}Z(s,t) - \frac{D}{dt}J(s,t). \end{align*} (End of proof.)

What I am wondering is, is there an asymptotic formula for the minimal perimeter $P_{min}$ of a disk of area $A$ which contains point $Q$, in the limit of a very small disk with $AK \ll 1$? What I imagine is something like $$ P_{min} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}+\text{powers of $K$ or derivatives of $K$ at $Q$} $$ The zeroth-order term comes from the planar case. My question is: Is such an expansion possible at all, and if it is, are any lowest order terms known? I have searched but I could not find any result of the sort. For geodesic disks, I have used the Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem to obtain $$ P_{geo} = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} \left( 1 - \frac{AK}{8\pi} \right) + O(\sqrt{A}A^2K^2) $$ or equivalently $$ P_{geo}^2 = 4 \pi A - A^2 K + O(A^3K^2) $$ which implies that a small geodesic disk of a given area will have larger perimeter in a negatively curved region than in a positively curved region.

Edit: So, by staring at it, I believe you can convince yourself that we can apply Leibniz rule to the $\alpha\beta$ term, yielding $$\star d \star (\alpha \wedge \beta)=\frac{(-1)^{n(p+q-1)}s}{p!q!} \left[ (\nabla_b \alpha^{[b a_2\ldots a_p})\beta^{a_{p+1}\ldots a_{p+q}]} + \alpha^{[b a_2\ldots a_p}(\nabla_b\beta^{a_{p+1}\ldots a_{p+q}]}) \right] f_{a_{2}}\wedge\ldots\wedge f_{a_{p+q}} $$ Then we have that, in coordinates, the codifferential acting on a $p$ form is $\delta = (-1)^{n(p-1)+1}s \star d \star$ and in coordinates, its action on $\alpha$ would be $$\delta\alpha = \frac{1}{(p-1)!}\left[-\nabla^b \alpha_{b a_2 \ldots a_p}\right]f^{a_2}\wedge\ldots\wedge f^{a_p} $$ I think I'm onto something...",,"['differential-geometry', 'semi-riemannian-geometry', 'hodge-theory']"

37,"Which (3,1)-tensors with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor, arise as the actual curvature tensor of a metric?","Which (3,1)-tensors with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor, arise as the actual curvature tensor of a metric?",,"This is a question that came to me while reading Kazumi Tsukada's paper ""Totally Geodesic Submanifolds and Curvature-Invariant Subspaces"". (I haven't read the whole thing.) He takes the set up of a 'curvature tensor' $R$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which I assume means a multilinear map $$  \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n, \ \ (u,v,w) \mapsto R(u,v)w,  $$ with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor. I'll call such a thing an 'abstract curvature tensor'. Then, Tsukada aims to classify 'curvature-invariant subspaces' $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This must be relevant in the problem of finding/classifying totally-geodesic submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds, since by Cartan's criterion, a TGS passes through a point with a given tangent space $W \subset T_pM$ precisely when local parallel translates of $W$ are $R$-invariant, for $R$ the Riemann curvature tensor. But it all seems a bit silly to me unless these abstract curvature tensors on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be realised as the curvature tensor of, if not a Levi-Civita connection of a metric, then at least of some connection on a manifold. So, Question: Given an abstract curvature tensor $R$ on a vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, when can we realise $R$ as the curvature tensor at a point $T_pM = V$, ideally for a Levi-Civita connection? Or, more generally, for a connection on some other vector bundle? Idea: Do a parameter count. The number of parameters for an abstract curvature tensor is $ n \choose 2 $ $= n(n-1)/2$, since the abstract sectional curvatures $\langle R(u,v)v,u \rangle$ determine $R$ by the symemtry properties. However, there are $n(n+1)/2$ parameters 'at each point' in choosing a Riemannain metric $g$. So, if the process of going from $g$ to $R$ has redundancy no more than 2, I expect that at least an open subset of all abstract curvature tensors can be realised as Riemann curvature tensors at a point. If someone could point me in the direction to an answer to this (which I suspect exists...?), or just has ideas, I'd be super grateful.","This is a question that came to me while reading Kazumi Tsukada's paper ""Totally Geodesic Submanifolds and Curvature-Invariant Subspaces"".

He takes the set up of a 'curvature tensor' $R$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which I assume means a multilinear map $$  \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n, \ \ (u,v,w) \mapsto R(u,v)w,  $$ with the symmetry properties of the Riemann curvature tensor. I'll call such a thing an 'abstract curvature tensor'. Then, Tsukada aims to classify 'curvature-invariant subspaces' $W \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This must be relevant in the problem of finding/classifying totally-geodesic submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds, since by Cartan's criterion, a TGS passes through a point with a given tangent space $W \subset T_pM$ precisely when local parallel translates of $W$ are $R$-invariant, for $R$ the Riemann curvature tensor. But it all seems a bit silly to me unless these abstract curvature tensors on $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be realised as the curvature tensor of, if not a Levi-Civita connection of a metric, then at least of some connection on a manifold. So, Question: Given an abstract curvature tensor $R$ on a vector space $V = \mathbb{R}^n$, when can we realise $R$ as the curvature tensor at a point $T_pM = V$, ideally for a Levi-Civita connection? Or, more generally, for a connection on some other vector bundle? Idea: Do a parameter count. The number of parameters for an abstract curvature tensor is $ n \choose 2 $ $= n(n-1)/2$, since the abstract sectional curvatures $\langle R(u,v)v,u \rangle$ determine $R$ by the symemtry properties. However, there are $n(n+1)/2$ parameters 'at each point' in choosing a Riemannain metric $g$. So, if the process of going from $g$ to $R$ has redundancy no more than 2, I expect that at least an open subset of all abstract curvature tensors can be realised as Riemann curvature tensors at a point. If someone could point me in the direction to an answer to this (which I suspect exists...?), or just has ideas, I'd be super grateful.",,"['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'connections']"

Nash's answer about his errors in the proof of embedding theorem,,"In the interview of John Nash taken by Christian Skau and Martin Gaussen, in EMS Newsletter, September, 2015 when asked Is it true, as rumours have it, that   you started to work on the embedding problem as a result   of a bet?

It turned out that one could do it in this case   with very few excess dimensions of the embedding space   compared with the manifold. I did it with two but then   Kuiper did it with only one. But he did not do it smoothly,   which seemed to be the right thing—since you are given   something smooth, it should have a smooth answer. and But a few years later, I made the generalisation to   smooth. I published it in a paper with four parts. There   is an error, I can confess now. Some forty years after the   paper was published, the logician Robert M.

I thought: “How could it be?” I   started to look at it and finally I realized the error in   that if you want to do a smooth embedding and you have   an infinite manifold, you divide it up into portions and   you have embeddings for a certain amount of metric on   each portion. So you are dividing it up into a number of   things: smaller, finite manifolds. But what I had done was   a failure in logic. I had proved that—how can I express   it?—that points local enough to any point where it was   spread out and differentiated perfectly if you take points   close enough to one point; but for two different points   it could happen that they were mapped onto the same   point. My question is: 1- What did Nash mean by very few excess dimensions of the embedding space compared with the manifold?

I only started learning homology and cohomogy a few weeks ago so the ideas here will be very basic, the cost being a very long thought process for something that could be done in a paragraph. Consider the projective space $P^1(\mathbb{C})$. It is well known that the line bundles $E$ over a topological space $X$ are classified up to isomorphsim by their Chern classes $c_1(E) \in H^2(X;\mathbb{Z})$. In the case of $P^1(\mathbb{C}) \cong S^2$ then $H^2(P^1(\mathbb{C});\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}$.

These two statements are clearly the same in some way, which I would like to show. In this case $c_1(E)$ is the top chern class and so is the Euler class of the vector bundle. Define the euler class via the Thom isomophism as folows: there exists an element of the relative cohomology group $u \in H^2(E, E \setminus E_0; \mathbf{Z})$ so the the restriction of $U$ to each fiber of $E$ is the orientation class on $F$.

Now $P^1(\mathbb{C})$ can be covered by two open sets, both homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, and the vector bundle over these will be the trivial bundle so given coordinites $(z, w)$ on $\mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C}-0$ the thom class on these is going to (I guess) like $\frac{1}{w} dw \wedge d \bar{w}$. I now try to glue these two back together to get a thom class over the whole bundle. Glue the two copies together by $(z , w) = (z^{-1} , \frac{z^n}{\|z\|^n}w)$. This corressponds to the vector bundle with hopotopy class $n \in \mathbb{Z} \cong \pi_1 (U(1))$. Now we want to see which thom class this gluing procedure produces. At this stage I've kind of lost the wood for the trees but I went ahead and did a lot of transforming into new coordinites and wedging and pulling back anyway.

I thought of the following problem: Let $\Gamma$ be the discrete group generated by \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 6 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} Then $\Gamma$ acts properly discontinuously on the Heisenberg group $H$ with compact quotient. The extension $0\to C(\Gamma) \to \Gamma \to \Gamma/C(\Gamma) \to 0$ shows that $H/\Gamma$ is a circle bundle over the torus. The numbers $3,4$ seem to determine a Riemannian structure on the torus, as when one quotients $\mathbb R^2$ by $(3\mathbb Z,4\mathbb Z)$ & similarly $6$ determines a Riemannian structure on the circle.

In the Riemannian setting this naturally leads to the question whether this can be done in such a way that the Riemannian metric is preserved, that is, whether we can find an embedding such that the inherited metric as a submanifold of Euclidean space is the original metric?

How is $\sigma$ different from a function $f:B \rightarrow F$ ? The standard answer I find everywhere is that $\sigma$ is only a function if E is the trivial bundle $B \times F$ , or that in general no such function exists with 'global structure', but I do not see why the former is true, and I do not understand what the latter means. A section seems like it is associating an element of the fibre F to every point in B. How is this not a function, even if E has some sort of non trivial topology? Why should 'twists' or other aberrations from a product in the space E matter, since the fibre over any point in B is the same?","Suppose with projection map and fibre F is a fibre bundle, with a section .

93,Characterizations of Riemannian Volume Form,Characterizations of Riemannian Volume Form,,"I'm trying to understand how some characterizations of the Riemannian volume form $dV$ are equivalent on an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ . I'm a bit new to Riemannian geometry (and self-studying it), and I can tell that it should just come down to a straightforward calculation, but I'm stuck for some reason. Characterization 1: If $(\omega^1,...,\omega^n)$ is a local oriented orthonormal coframe for the cotangent bundle, then $dV=\omega^1\wedge...\wedge\omega^n$ . Characterization 2: If $(y^1,...,y^n)$ are oriented local coordinates, then $dV=\sqrt{\det(g_{ij})}dy^1\wedge...\wedge dy^n$ where $g_{ij}$ is the representation of the Riemannian metric in local coordinates. I'm guessing that the square root of the determinant factor shows up from something involving $\det(A)=\sqrt{\det(A A^t)}$ for a suitable matrix $A$ . I have a hunch that using uniqueness of the form (which follows for e.g. characterization 1 from the fact that you can cover the manifold with charts that have local oriented orthonormal coframes) might be important?
