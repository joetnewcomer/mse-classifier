Does  Does there exist a bijective continuous function from $ [a,b] \rightarrow  (a,b))$? No. as inverse image of open set is not open so there can not exist any continuous bijective function. Please correct me if I am wrong anywhere .And give examples of $(4)$ if any exists. Thanx very much for your time","I was looking for examples of bijective continuous functions infollowing cases Does there exist Bijective continuous function $(0,1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$? Yes, $f(x)=\frac{2x-1}{x-x^2}$ Does there exist Bijective continuous function from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  (0,1)$ ? Yes, as $(0,1) and \mathbb{R}$ are homeomorphic so inverse of $f(x)$ defined above will be example such a function. Does there exist a bijective continuous function from $[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$? I think No, as continuous image of compact set is not compact. Does there exist a bijective continuous function from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow  [a,b])$ ? For this clearly it can be seen a) continuous image of connected set is connected. b) Inverse image of closed set under continuous map is closed. So there exist such a function but i can not construct it. Does  Does there exist a bijective continuous function from $ (a,b)  \rightarrow  [a,b])$? No. as inverse image of closed set is not closed so there can not exist any continuous bijective function. But as $(a,b)$ is  homeomorphic  to $\mathbb{R}$So if we construct a function $\mathbb{R \rightarrow}  [a,b]$ will that function work as an example of a function $ (a,b)  \rightarrow  [a,b])$?

96,A question on mapping inside unit disc,A question on mapping inside unit disc,,"For an analytic function $f:\bar D→\bar D$ where $\bar D$ is the closed unit disc centered at origin.Suppose $\bar D=D\cup$$\delta D$, where $\delta D$ is the boundary of open disc $D$ and $f$ is onto, then is it true that $f(\delta D)=\delta f(D)$ i.e. boundary of domain maps onto the boundary of image? My attempt: I think the answer is yes. I took $f(z)$=$(z-a)/(1-$$\bar a z$) where $a\in D$ which gives $|f(exp(i\theta)|=1$.","For an analytic function $f:\bar D→\bar D$ where $\bar D$ is the closed unit disc centered at origin.Suppose $\bar D=D\cup$$\delta D$, where $\delta D$ is the boundary of open disc $D$ and $f$ is onto, then is it true that $f(\delta D)=\delta f(D)$ i.e. boundary of domain maps onto the boundary of image?
