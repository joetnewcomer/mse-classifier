I tried to solve it by myself but I am stuck and I would appreciate a hint to solve this kind of problems. Also, there are similar questions on this site for not quite exactly the same problem, but I didn't find an answer that could help me. Current attempt First, when $n$ is odd, the result must be zero. A string satisfying the desired property would necessarly have an even length, as a permutation of the concatenation of substrings of even lengths (each substring being a character from $S$ repeatead even times). Now, let's suppose that $n$ is even. If we have a mapping $c$ from $S$ to $\mathbb{N}$ assigning the number of occurence of each character (e.g. $c_A=0, c_B=2, c_C=4, c_D=0$), then the number of strings $N(c)$ we can produce with this mapping would be a k-permutation of characters, as we choose a string of size $n$ with $c_A$ times $A$, $c_B$ times $B$, etc. : $$N(c) = \frac{n!}{c_A! c_B! c_C! c_D!}$$ Also, I can evaluate the number of such mappings $c$: this is equivalent to finding the number of strings where characters appear in order with varying occurences. For example, with $n=4$: $$\begin{array}{c|cccc} &            c_A & c_B & c_C &c_D \\ \hline      AAAA &  4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\      AABB &  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\      AACC &  2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ \dots\\ \end{array} $$ The number of strings of size $n$ with an even number of each character is exactly the same as the number of strings of size $k=n/2$ with single characters (just imagine that AA, BB, CC, DD are characters). So, the number of mappings is the number of combinations of characters from $S$, with repetition, like the following ones with $k=2$: AA AB AC AD BB BC BD CC CD DD That is given as a $k$-combination of 4 elements: $$ N_{mapping}(k) = \binom{|S|+k-1}{k} = \binom {3+k}{k}$$ This is where I'am stuck. I wanted to combine this number of mappings with the number of permutations computed by each mapping, previously, but I can't ($N(c)$ depends on actual values of the mapping $c$).

For example, with $n=4$: $$\begin{array}{c|cccc} &            c_A & c_B & c_C &c_D \\ \hline      AAAA &  4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\      AABB &  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\      AACC &  2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ \dots\\ \end{array} $$ The number of strings of size $n$ with an even number of each character is exactly the same as the number of strings of size $k=n/2$ with single characters (just imagine that AA, BB, CC, DD are characters). So, the number of mappings is the number of combinations of characters from $S$, with repetition, like the following ones with $k=2$: AA AB AC AD BB BC BD CC CD DD That is given as a $k$-combination of 4 elements: $$ N_{mapping}(k) = \binom{|S|+k-1}{k} = \binom {3+k}{k}$$ This is where I'am stuck. I wanted to combine this number of mappings with the number of permutations computed by each mapping, previously, but I can't ($N(c)$ depends on actual values of the mapping $c$). Also, I am sure there is a more straightforward approach, but I don't know how to proceed. Thanks for any help you could provide.",,['combinatorics']

A binary sequence is called friendly if each term is adjacent to at least one term that is equal to 1. For example, the sequence $0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1$ is friendly. Let $F_n$ denote the number of friendly binary sequences with $n$ terms. Find the smallest positive integer $n\geq 2$ such that $F_n>100$ .

31,Languages acceptable with just a single final state,Languages acceptable with just a single final state,,"For a given regular language $L$ we can always find a corresponding automaton with exactly one initial state, this is quite a common result and in most textbooks even non-deterministic automata are just allowed to have a single start state. Now I am curious under what conditions is a single final state sufficient. Of course, sometimes a single final state is not enough (even for non-deterministic automata), for example for the language $L = \{a, bb\}$ or $L = a \cup bb^{\ast}$ (of course under the assumption that $\varepsilon$-transition are not allowed). I guess if we allow multiple initial states in non-deterministic automata, then we can always find a non-deterministic automata with a single final state (it might have multiple start states). For a proof, if $L$ is regular, then let $\mathcal A$ be an accepting automaton for $L^R$ (i.e. the mirrored language) with a single initial state $q_0$. Then reverse all transitions and declare $q_0$ to be its single final state, and all original final states as initial states, and we have an automaton for $(L^R)^R = L$ which has just a single final state. So is this observation correct, or are there automata for which we always need more than one final state, even if we allow multiple start states. And also could the languages which could be accepted with just a single final state (in the deterministic, and in the non-deterministic with a single initial state) somehow characterised? Also note that $L = X^{\ast}0X$ for $X = \{0,1\}$ could not be accepted by a DEA with a single final state, but by an NEA with a single final state and a single initial state. EDIT: A straightforward characterisation for the deterministic case, as the number of nerode right-congruence classes whose union is $L$ is an upper bound for the number of final states (as they could not be further merged), we have that $L$ could be accepted by such an automaton iff it is itself an equivalence class. This also shows that by adding final states we could not gain anything in the sense that the automaton gets smaller.","For a given regular language $L$ we can always find a corresponding automaton with exactly one initial state, this is quite a common result and in most textbooks even non-deterministic automata are just allowed to have a single start state.

Proof : Consider forming a new permutation with $n$ objects from a permutation of $n - 1$ objects by adding a distinguished object. There are exactly two ways in which this can be accomplished. First, we could form a singleton cycle, leaving the extra object fixed. This increases the number of cycles by $1$ and so accounts for the $s(n - 1, k - 1)$ term in the recurrence. Second, we could insert the object into one of the existing cycles. Consider an arbitrary permutation of $n - 1$ objects with $k$ cycles.

Given an attendance record of length $n$ , then, how many rewardable records exist? For example, for $n=2$ , only AA fails to be rewarded, of $3^2$ possible strings, so the answer is $8$ . Official Solution The official solution attempts to build a recurrence relation, starting with this diagram: It explains: Let $f[n]$ represent the number of rewardable cases for a string of length $n$ . Let's divide into two cases, Strings ending with L . Strings ending with P . (I don't know why it says N in the diagram; typo, I think.) It's easy to see that the second case is rewardable as long as the piece preceding the P , $f[n-1]$ , is rewardable. However, the L case must be split into four pieces, as shown. There, the author claims that the only troublesome piece is the last, ending the string in LLL . His exact words are, Out of the four combinations possible at the end, the fourth combination, ending with a $LL$ at the end leads to an unrewardable string. But, since we've considered only rewardable strings of length $n-3$ , for the last string to be rewardable at length $n-3$ and unawardable at length $n-1$ , it must be preceded by a $PP$ before the $LL$ . Thus, accounting for the first string [left branch] again, all the rewardable strings of length $n-1$ , except the strings of length $n−4$ followed by $PLL$ , can contribute to a rewardable string of length $n$ . Thus, this string accounts for a factor of $f[n-1] - f[n-4]$ to $f[n]$ . Thus, the recurring relation becomes: $$f[n] = 2f[n-1] - f[n-4]$$ I was hoping someone could put this explanation in their own words, because I don't understand this author's. And he has made several typos in his explanation already, so I'm not sure I trust this explanation.

These debts can be settled by (1) finding the net debt $d(p)$ owed to each person $p \in P$, (2) dividing $P$ into two disjoint sets of people who are owed, $P_+ = \{p : d(p) > 0\}$, and people who owe, $P_- = \{p : d(p) < 0\}$, and (3) having the people in $P_-$ pay the ones in $P_+$. Then the problem of resolving debts with the fewest transactions is equivalent to the above optimization problem, with $a_{ij}$ being the amount that the $i$th person in $P_-$ must give the $j$th person in $P_+$.",,['combinatorics']

95,Converting $68^8$ microseconds to years without calculator,Converting  microseconds to years without calculator,68^8,"The following problem is easy to solve with the help of a calculator. However, when doing it manually, we are faced with a very large exponentiation ( $68^8$ ) and which, at first glance, does not seem possible to be manipulated together with the remaining data of the problem to find a simplified final result. The problem follows: Suppose a password for a computer system must be exactly $8$ characters long, where each character in the password is either a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter, a decimal digit, or one of six special characters ( *><!+= ). If it takes a microsecond ( $10^{-6}$ seconds) for a hacker to check if a password is correct, how many years would it take for the hacker to try every possible password? What I've tried: Using a calculator, I first calculate the number of possible passwords, which is $68^8$ . Then I multiply it by the time it takes for the hacker to test each one, so it becomes $68^8\times10^{-6}$ . To convert the result into years, I first convert it into minutes by dividing by $60$ , then into hours by dividing by $60$ again, then I convert it into days by dividing by $24$ , and finally into years by dividing by $365$ . It gives a little more than $14$ years. I have tried to simplify the expression $$\frac{68^8}{10^6\cdot 60^2\cdot 24\cdot 365}$$ that gives the answer of the question, but even finding some common factors between numerator and denominator, this doesn't help too much, because $17$ is a prime factor of $68$ , and I don't think it appears as a factor of anything in the denominator. Also, I would like to do that in a efficient way, in a short time, without spending too much paper. Edit.: We have noticed that a aproximated answer is the better option here. I think it is suficient to get the integer part of the aumont of years.","The following problem is easy to solve with the help of a calculator.

We can interpret all possible numberings as permutations of pairs of opposing faces, as well as the permutations within those pairs. This gives $2^6\times6!=46080$ possible combinations (regardless of rotational symmetry), described by the group $C_2\wr S_6$ . There are 60 rotational symmetries of a dodecahedron, described by the group $I$ (or $A_5$ ). There is only one element of $I$ (the identity) that will preserve any of the permutations; all other elements will modify the permutations in some way. By Burnside's Lemma, that means there are $\frac{46080}{60}=768$ canonical dice numberings up to rotational symmetry. This answer leaves me somewhat unsatisfied, however. It's good to have a number, but it isn't very intuitive to me.
