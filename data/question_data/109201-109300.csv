The question is motivated by a homework problem from a class in representation theory. The homework problem is to describe all the irreducible complex representations of the above group. I began by doing pages of calculations in the group, trying to find the conjugacy classes by hand, so I would know how many representations to expect and might be able to play with the numbers to find their dimensions. I turned away from this because it was getting too computationally heavy for me to feel safe I wasn't making any small mistakes. I've started looking for representations in an ad-hoc way, but I don't know how many to expect or what dimensions, so this is also pretty hairy. Also, I'd like to organize my results using the character table, but for this again I would need to know the group's decomposition into conjugacy classes. Besides specific computations, here is what I have figured out about the group: it is a semidirect product of $D_4$ and $C_2\times C_2\times C_2$. This is because it acts on vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^4$ with last component 0. The action coincides with the action of the upper left $3\times 3$ block on $\mathbb{F}_2^3$, so this gives us a homomorphism onto the subgroup of $SL(3,\mathbb{F}_2)$ of upper-triangular matrices with 1's on the main diagonal. This latter group is isomorphic to $D_4$, and the restriction of the homomorphism to the subgroup of the original group which is 0 off the diagonal in the last column is an isomorphism. The kernel is the subgroup of matrices that are zero off the main diagonal away from the last column, and this is isomorphic to $C_2\times C_2\times C_2$. However I am unsure how to use this information to find the class equation.","Can you point me toward a computation-light derivation of the class equation of the subgroup of $SL(4,\mathbb{F}_2)$ consisting of upper-triangular matrices with 1's on the main diagonal?

3,Finding an outer automorphism of $S_6$,Finding an outer automorphism of,S_6,"From Wikipedia I found out about the fact that $S_6$ has outer automorphisms.

This gives you a subgroup of index $6$ in $S_6$, let's call it $H$. And so we can use the left coset action or conjugation on $H$ to construct an automorphism of $S_6$ (for conjugation you have to show $[G : N_G(H)] = 6$ ). Then it turns out that this mapping does not send a transposition to its conjugate (another transposition) but to a product of three disjoint transpositions. This means that it is not an inner automorphism. Okay, makes sense to me.

5,Proof of $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{q-1}$ by group action?,Proof of  by group action?,\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{q-1},"Let $G$ and $H$ be groups, and $\varphi\colon G\to\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ a homomorphism. Then, further than all the results valid for a general group action on a set, the following additional one holds: $$\operatorname{Fix}(g):=\{h\in H\mid \varphi_g(h)=h\}\le H \tag 1$$ For finite $G$ and $H$ , the condition $(1)$ brings new opportunities, as now $\left|\operatorname{Fix}(g)\right|$ divides $|H|$ ; as an example, for $p, q$ distinct primes such that $p\nmid q-1$ , one can prove from here that there are no nontrivial homomorphisms $\phi\colon C_p\to\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$ , by no means knowing anything on the structure of $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$ . If, in addition, $\varphi$ is injective , then this setting may lead to some other result: for instance, for $q$ prime and $H=C_q$ , I was able to prove via $(1)$ that $|G|$ divides $q-1$ , again by no means knowing anything on the structure of $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$$^\dagger$ . Question . One step ahead in this escalation, if $\varphi$ is an isomorphism , I expect this setting to lead to further group action conditions (involving stabilizers, fixed points subgroups, orbits, etc.), potentially useful in getting the structure (isomorphism class) of $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ , for some known $H$ . In particular, as entry test of this approach, I'm aiming to retrieve in this way the known result $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong C_{q-1}$ . Edit (2021-11-5). The integer $|G|-k$ is the number of $g\in G$ such that $\left|\operatorname{Fix}(g)\right|=q$ , namely the number of $g\in G$ such that $\varphi_g(h)=h$ for every $h\in C_q$ , namely the number of $g\in G$ such that $\varphi_g=\operatorname{Id}_{C_q}$ , whence: $$|G|-k=\left|\operatorname{ker}\varphi\right| \tag{1bis}$$ If $\varphi$ is injective, then $\left|\operatorname{ker}\varphi\right|=1$ and $(1\text{bis})$ yields: $k=|G|-1$ . But $k$ is the number of $g\in G$ such that $\left|\operatorname{Fix}(g)\right|=1$ , namely the number of $g\in G$ such that $\varphi_g(h)=h\Longrightarrow h=1$ . Therefore, every nontrivial $g\in G$ is sent to an automorphism of $C_q$ which moves all the nontrivial elements of $C_q$ . If, in addition, $G\cong\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$ , then every $\psi\in\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\setminus\{\operatorname{Id}_{C_q}\}$ moves all the nontrivial elements of $C_q$ . So, $C_q$ has at most $q-1$ automorphisms, all but one (the identity) of which move all the nontrivial elements of $C_q$ . Suppose we have proved that there are precisely $q-1$ automorphisms: would the fact that $q-2$ of them move all the nontrivial elements of $C_q$ imply that some of them (automorphisms) must have order $q-1$ ? Edit (2021-11-8). By the previous edit, every $\psi\in\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\setminus\{\operatorname{Id}_{C_q}\}$ is of the form: \begin{alignat}{1} &\psi(1)=1 \\ &\psi(a^i)=a^{\sigma(i)} \\ \end{alignat} where $\sigma\in S_{q-1}$ has cycle type $(r_1,\dots,r_N)$ ( $r_1\le\dots\le r_N$ ), for some $N\ge 1$ , with: $r_i\ge 2$ , for every $i=1,\dots,N$ $\sum_{i=1}^Nr_i=q-1$ Note that, if a cycle $(i_1\dots i_s)$ which composes $\sigma$ is such that $\sum_{j=1}^si_j\not\equiv 0\pmod q$ , then: \begin{alignat}{1} \psi(a^{i_1}\dots a^{i_s}) &= \psi(a^{i_1+\dots+i_s\pmod q}) \\ &= a^{\sigma(i_1+\dots+i_s\pmod q)} \\ \end{alignat} and: \begin{alignat}{1} \psi(a^{i_1})\dots\psi(a^{i_s}) &= a^{\sigma(i_1)}\dots a^{\sigma(i_s)} \\ &= a^{\sigma(i_1)+\dots+\sigma(i_s)\pmod q} \\ \end{alignat} whence: \begin{alignat}{1} a^{\sigma(i_1+\dots+i_s\pmod q)} &= a^{\sigma(i_1)+\dots+\sigma(i_s)\pmod q}  \\ \end{alignat} and finally (being the $a^i$ 's distinct and by definition of cycle): \begin{alignat}{1} \sigma(i_1+\dots+i_s\pmod q) &= \sigma(i_1)+\dots+\sigma(i_s)\pmod q  \\ &= i_1+\dots+i_s\pmod q  \\ \end{alignat} which is a contradiction, because $\sigma$ doesn't fix any element of $\{1,\dots,q-1\}$ . Therefore, every cycle $(i_1\dots i_s)$ which composes $\sigma$ must fulfil the condition: $$\sum_{j=1}^si_j\equiv 0\pmod q\tag{1ter}$$ Maybe , the condition $(1\text{ter})$ , which is fulfilled in particular by the $(q-1)$ -cycles, limits the possibilities enough that, for some of the nontrivial automorphisms $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_{q-2}$ , the corresponding $\sigma$ must be a $(q-1)$ -cycle? Edit (2021-11-29). By taking as known that $^{\dagger\dagger}$ $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong (\Bbb Z/q\Bbb Z)^\times$ , we can take advantage of $G$ being a finite abelian group, and use the framework in the previous Edit to prove, e.g. , that $\operatorname{Aut}(C_7)$ (and then $(\Bbb Z/7\Bbb Z)^\times$ ) is cyclic. In fact, the order of every element divides the maximal order among the elements in $G$ . By contradiction, let's assume that such maximal order is $3$ . Then, all the nontrivial elements must have order $3$ . But then, the only nontrivial permutations fulfilling the constraints in the previous Edit are: $\sigma_1=(124)(356)$ , $\sigma_2=(142)(356)$ , $\sigma_3=(124)(365)$ , $\sigma_4=(142)(365)$ , namely too few to build up the whole $\operatorname{Aut}(C_7)$ . Likewise, let's assume that such maximal order is $2$ . Then, all the nontrivial elements must have order $2$ . But then, the only nontrivial permutation fulfilling the constraints in the previous Edit is $\sigma_1=(16)(25)(34)$ , definitely too few to build up the whole $\operatorname{Aut}(C_7)$ . Therefore, $\operatorname{Aut}(C_7)$ (or, equivalently, $(\Bbb Z/7\Bbb Z)^\times$ ) must have an element of (maximal) order $6$ . Maybe this kind of argument can be generalized to every $q$ ? $^\dagger$ Every automorphism of $C_q$ is a permutation of its $q-1$ nontrivial elements; therefore, $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong K\le S_{q-1}$ and hence $\left|\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\right|$ divides $(q-1)!$ . For an embedding $\varphi\colon G\hookrightarrow\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$ , $|G|$ divides $\left|\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\right|$ and $\operatorname{Fix}(g):=\{h\in C_q\mid \varphi_g(h)=h\}$ is a subgroup of $C_q$ . But $C_q$ has no nontrivial subgroups; therefore: \begin{alignat}{1} \sum_{g\in G}\left|\operatorname{Fix}(g)\right| &= k+(|G|-k)q \\ &= |G|q-k(q-1) \\ \tag 2 \end{alignat} for some $k$ , $0\le k\le |G|$ . By Burnside's Lemma, $|G|$ divides the LHS of $(2)$ , and hence $|G|$ divides $k(q-1)$ either. The case $k=|G|$ corresponds to a transitive action, whence $q\mid |G|$ : contradiction, because $|G| \mid\left|\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\right|$ and $\left|\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\right|\mid(q-1)!$ , but $q\nmid (q-1)!$ . Therefore, $k<|G|$ and then necessarily $|G|\mid q-1$ . $^{\dagger\dagger}$ After all, here the focus is to prove the cyclicity of $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)$ , and the standard result $\operatorname{Aut}(C_q)\cong U_q$ can be then assumed as known - see e.g. Herstein's Topics in Algebra , 2nd Edition, Example 2.8.1, page 69.","Let and be groups, and a homomorphism.

7,"Is there a theory of ""almost symmetry"" generalizing group theory?","Is there a theory of ""almost symmetry"" generalizing group theory?",,"Apologies for the inescapably soft question. Does there exist a theory that aims to develop tools analogous to those of group theory, except for the study of objects that are merely almost symmetrical? I am not sure what exactly it would look like, and I haven't been able to find what I'm looking for via internet searches. Here are the types of objects of study I have in mind: A convex polyhedron that is a slight perturbation of a regular icosahedron (perhaps I realized the icosahedron as the intersection of half-spaces, and moved one of the half-spaces a tiny bit) is not $A_5$ -symmetrical, but e.g. there will be an action of $A_5$ on the ambient space such that all the images of my almost-regular icosahedron will be contained in a thin tubular neighborhood of its original position. If I know my object has this type of ""almost symmetry"" then I know something about it constraining its geometry, even though it is not actually symmetrical. Consider a rooted tree consisting of a root with 10 branches, each of which has 100 leaves, except one which has 101. If all the branches had 100 leaves, then the tree would have an automorphism group isomorphic to $S_{100}\wr S_{10}$ , acting transitively on the leaves. As it is, the automorphism group is $(S_{100}\wr S_9) \times S_{101}$ , with 900 leaves falling into one orbit and 101 falling into the other. There's no room in these considerations for the fact that 100 and 101 are close-together numbers. In some contexts, this is clearly as it should be, but in others, one might want a more permissive way to capture the almost-symmetrical nature of the graph. For example, if the tree is the setting for some sort of game, and the players begin the game on the leaves, and move about the tree as the game progresses, then an automorphism group transitive on the leaves expresses a kind of ""fairness"" with respect to the initial positions of the players. In this context, depending on the rules of the game, it might be that the game in which one of the branches has 101 instead of 100 leaves is ""still fair enough"", and one would then want a more permissive description that allows to capture this ""near equality of initial states"" than is captured by the actual graph automorphism group.","Apologies for the inescapably soft question.

75,What does the Cayley graph of the Grigorchuk group 'look like'?,What does the Cayley graph of the Grigorchuk group 'look like'?,,"I've recently renewed my interest in tilings, and as a result have taken some splashes into Word Processing in Groups (in search of good information on the automatic groups related to hyperbolic tilings) and the amazing The Symmetries of Things .  This got me thinking about the question in the title: the isogonal embedding of Cayley graphs of certain groups (the simplest example certainly being $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with the presentation $\{a,b\ |\ ab=ba\}$) as plane tilings implies the polynomial growth of those groups.  Contrariwise, while a group like the free group on two generators can't have a 'nice' embedding in the plane because of its exponential growth rate, it can be embedded fairly nicely into the hyperbolic plane (indeed, versions of this sort of embedding form the basis of the various hyperbolic visualization tools; see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_tree ).  So what about the Grigorchuk Group $G$? To be a bit more concrete: I'm particularly interested in the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to its 'full' (non-minimal) set of generators $a,b,c,d$.  Here are the things I've been able to figure out about it from first principles: Obviously this graph can't be isogonally embedded in any Euclidean space, for the reasons given above: since its growth rate is superpolynomial, there's not enough room for all the different group elements of length $n$ to be $n$ unit 'steps' away from the origin in any isogonal manner. The graph has arbitrarily large 'faces' (that is, minimal cycles) in it, corresponding to the lack of a finite presentation of $G$. I'm fairly certain the graph isn't planar: since the generators $b,c,d$ generate a subgroup of $G$ isomorphic to the Klein 4-group, each vertex of the Cayley graph is part of some embedded $K_4$ (corresponding to some element of the form $wa$ and the associated elements $wab, wac, wad$).  In particular, the four elements $e, b, c, d$ form a $K_4$ subgraph, and any independent connection of each of these four elements to some other common element (which I'm reasonably certain must exist) would induce a $K_5$ in the Cayley graph and thus imply non-planarity. OTOH, it seems like it should be possible to 'mod out' the Cayley graph of $G$ by these $K_4$s, creating a reduced graph where vertices of the graph correspond to equivalence classes $\langle wa, wab, wac, wad\rangle$ of elements and the four edges from any vertex correspond to (right) multiplication of the element $wa$ by $a$, $ba$, $ca$, and $da$; this seems like it shouldn't fundamentally change the structure of the graph, just collapse the 'trivial' local structure. It's this last reduced graph that I'm particularly curious about: is it planar?  Better yet, does it have any sort of nice (ideally isogonal) embedding into the hyperbolic plane?

I came up with an attempt at the proof: Let $K$ be the kernel of the action. $ex = x \implies e\in K \implies K$ contains identity. Let $a,b\in K$. $(ab)x=a(bx) = ax=x \implies ab\in K \implies K$ is closed. $a\in K \implies ax=x\implies x=a^{-1}x\implies a^{-1}\in K\implies$ all elements in $K$ has an inverse. Hence $K$ is a group. Let $g\in G$. $(gKg^{-1})x=(gK)(g^{-1}x)=g(K(g^{-1}x))=g(g^{-1}x)=x\implies gKg^{-1}\subset K$ Substitute $g$ for $g^{-1}$ and we get $K\subset gKg^{-1}$. Hence $gKg^{-1}=K$ and $K$ is normal. Is this approach correct? Also, suppose we were to consider the isotropy group of an element $x\in G$ instead. i.e. $G_x=\lbrace g\in G\mid gx=x\rbrace$ $G_x$ will be a subgroup of $G$ using a similar argument, but now it is not guaranteed to be a normal subgroup because in $(gG_xg^{-1})x=g(G_x(g^{-1}x))$, $G_x(g^{-1}x)=g^{-1}x$ is not necessary true. Is this argument right? Thanks for your time!",,"['group-theory', 'group-actions']"
