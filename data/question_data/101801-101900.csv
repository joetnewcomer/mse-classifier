0,Finding the area of a quadrilateral in this picture,Finding the area of a quadrilateral in this picture,,"This was from a past exam we were given. I am stuck, but here is what I have so far. To find the area of EFGH, we can find the individual coordinates of E,F,G,H so we can find the distance between each vertex and finally compute the area. According to hint, I will centre $B(0,0)$ . Since $|AB| =2$ , then I label $A(0,2)$ . We were also given that $E$ has a height of $1$ . So I label $E(x,1)$ , where x is some unknown x coordinate. I was able to obtain x by using that the triangle ABE is equilateral, so all three sides are equal. Hence $|AB| = |BE| = 2$ . Also $|EG| = 1$ . Then the triangle BEG is a right angled triangle, so by pythagorean $x = \sqrt{3}$ . Hence $E(\sqrt{3}, 1)$ . Following this, we also have $G(\sqrt{3},0)$ . But now, I am stuck on finding $H$ and $F$ , as it seems they are not really given anything in the question to work with. Edit: I can try to find the equation of the line connecting B and E. That would give $y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}x$ . However, it doesn't seem like we know either x or y coordinates.","This was from a past exam we were given. I am stuck, but here is what I have so far.

I've tried to find other answers here and elsewhere, but none of the answers were exactly intuitive and so it was hard for me to understand, and so decided to ask my own question. According to the book, one of the properties of the inner product between two vectors is that it must be positive definite. To borrow the exact words: An inner product on $\Bbb{R}^n$ is a function $\langle\ \cdot\ ,\ \cdot\ \rangle: \Bbb{R}^n \times \Bbb{R}^n \rightarrow \Bbb{R}$ on two vector variables that satisfies the following properties: Positive definiteness: The necessary and sufficient condition for $\langle\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{a} \rangle \ge 0$ and $\langle\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{a}\rangle = 0$ is $\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}$ . Commutativity: $\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{a} \rangle$ Linear on the first argument: $\langle \mathbf{a}_1 + \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{b} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{b} \rangle + \langle \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{b} \rangle$ and $\langle \alpha \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle = \alpha \langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle = \langle \mathbf{a}, \alpha \mathbf{b} \rangle$ I'm having trouble understanding the positive definiteness. Why is that so? What is the geometric meaning of an inner product having to be positive definite? In fact, I've never even heard of this before when I was studying linear algebra. I merely learned that the inner product of two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ is: $$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_ib_i$$ One Reddit answer brought up the concept of ""distance"" and that if an inner product is not positive definite then we cannot define distance between two vectors, but I'm having trouble understanding that as well. Also, I thought that positive definiteness did not include equality (i.e. $\ge$ ) and rather positive semi-definiteness is the one that included equality.

Why squaring?,,"It seems that squaring appears not only in classical Euclidean geometry, but also in physics and statistics. Not too long ago, 3b1b released a video on where pi comes from in the normal distribution equation. In short, the assumption of the uncorrelatedness of two parameters (in the case of a two-dimensional distribution) leads to the quadratic power of the variable and only to it, which can then be generalized to any number of dimensions (that is, parameters). Pi is needed for unitarity. It seems to me that this is very similar to the reasoning when deriving a Pythagorean metric for an arbitrary number of dimensions! However, it is not clear where exactly the second degree, and not some other, comes from. It seems that only the Pythagorean metric (and also the Riemannian, but locally it is Pythagorean and flat) is continuous and smooth at any point, any direction, and any scale.

Not too long ago, 3b1b released a video on where pi comes from in the normal distribution equation. In short, the assumption of the uncorrelatedness of two parameters (in the case of a two-dimensional distribution) leads to the quadratic power of the variable and only to it, which can then be generalized to any number of dimensions (that is, parameters). Pi is needed for unitarity. It seems to me that this is very similar to the reasoning when deriving a Pythagorean metric for an arbitrary number of dimensions!
