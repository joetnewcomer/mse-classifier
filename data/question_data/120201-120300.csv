1,rectangularizing the square,rectangularizing the square,,"There is a square that I want to divide to n people, such that each person gets a rectangular piece with an equal area. An obvious option is to cut 1-by-n rectangles of size n-by-1, but the people don't want such rectangles, they say they are too skinny. They want to get R-balanced rectangles , which are defined as axis-aligned rectangles whose width-height ratio is between $R$ and $1/R$ (where $R \geq 1$ ). What is the minimum R for which I can guarantee that, for every n, there is a division of a square to n equal-area R-balanced rectangles? Some notes and sub-questions: A 1-balanced rectangle is just a square. So, for $R=1$ , a division is possible only when n is a square number. For $R=2$ , I managed to find a division for $n=1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ , but I haven't found a division for $n=3$ , and also haven't managed to prove that it is impossible. What do you think?

2,Geometry question with rectangles purely out of curiosity,Geometry question with rectangles purely out of curiosity,,"Apologies in advance, I really cannot think of an intelligent or easy way to explain this. You start out with a rectangle. Then you draw a straight line out of a right angled corner at 45 degrees until you hit a side of the rectangle at which point you reflect the line at 90 degrees and continue the line. Repeat this process until the line goes into a second corner. Sorry if that image is hard to imagine. If you add the length and width of the rectangle (providing they are both integers and have no common factors) that is the number of points of contact the lines have with the outline of the rectangle: (the walls and the 2 corners) If the lengths aren't integers then you have to make then integers before you add them eg. 0.2cm and 0.3cm = 2cm and 3cm. Or if they have factors then factorise them eg. 6cm and 4cm = 3cm and 2cm QUESTION If anyone understands all of that, can anyone explain if and why that is true for every rectangle? Is it just a coincidence or is there maths behind it that I can't find?

33,Why is this conic through a triangle similar to this other one through one of its cevian triangles?,Why is this conic through a triangle similar to this other one through one of its cevian triangles?,,"Update 09/02/24: I have accepted dan_fulea's excellent efforts as an answer so that it doesn't appear as 'unanswered' because this post is no longer the well-defined question I first asked. I'm still interested in other responses too though, especially if people can point to existing literature that may be relevant. Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle and $K$ some other generic point (*). Let $\triangle DEF$ be the cevian triangle of $\triangle ABC$ with respect to $K$ . That is, $D$ is where $AK$ meets $BC$ , $E$ is where $BK$ meets $CA$ , and $F$ is where $CK$ meets $AB$ . If $U,V,W$ are the respective midpoints of $EF, FD, DE$ then it can be proved (using areal coordinates for example) that the three lines $AU,BV,CW$ are concurrent, at $T$ say. Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ be the conic through $A,B,C,K$ and $T$ , and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be the conic through $D,E,F,K$ and $T$ . It appears that $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are directly similar i.e. have the same eccentricity and the same ""orientation"". My questions are whether or not this is known and how to prove explain it? (Update 27/01/24: They in fact do not always have the same eccentricity when they are hyperbolas. See below for details which contains a sketch proof that was found with the help of a computer. I'm still not able to explain the relationship between the two conics so I am updating the question rather than posting an answer.) I was initially interested in drawing these conics because it would follow that, if $P_1$ , $P_2$ are two points on $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $Q_1, Q_2$ are two points on $\mathcal{C}_2$ such that $P_1KQ_1$ are collinear and $P_2TQ_2$ are collinear then $P_1P_2$ and $Q_1Q_2$ are parallel. I can write down the equations of the conics in areal coordinates (with respect to $\triangle ABC$ ) in terms of the coordinates of $K$ , and this allows me to calculate their centres and show using a fairly complicated identity that $\mathcal{C}_1$ is an ellipse/hyperbola if and only if $\mathcal{C}_2$ is an ellipse/hyperbola (making use of formulae from Chapter 2 of The Algebra of Geometry by C. J. Bradley) but I'm not sure if this is the best approach because the algebra seems to be getting too complicated to do much more. (*) Specifically, $K$ is not on $AB,BC$ or $CA$ , nor on the medians of $\triangle ABC$ , nor on the line through $A$ parallel $BC$ , the line though $B$ parallel to $CA$ or the line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ . Update 27/01/24: Having not been able to think of anything else I resorted to getting computer help with the algebra. I am adding some comments here in case of interest. Suppose $K$ has areal coordinates $(l,m,n)$ with respect to $\triangle ABC$ . So $A,B,C$ are represented by $(1,0,0), (0,1,0),(0,0,1)$ and $D,E,F$ by $(0,m,n),(l,0,n),(l,m,0)$ . Note these are not normalised so coordinates don't sum to 1. Now $U$ is given by $(l/(n+l)+l/(m+l),m/(l+m),n/(n+l))$ and $V,W$ symmetrically. It can be verified that the point $T$ with coordinates $(l(m+n),m(n+l),n(l+m))$ lies on $AU,BV$ and $CW$ . (The reference above by C. J. Bradley contains an introduction to areal coordinates and how they are used to prove this sort of thing.) If we let $$ \Phi_{1}^{\text{areal}} = \begin{pmatrix} 	0 & n(l^2 - m^2) & m(n^2 - l^2) \\ 	n(l^2 - m^2) & 0 & l(m^2 - n^2) \\ 	m(n^2 - l^2) & l(m^2 - n^2) & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ $$\Phi_{2}^{\text{areal}} = \begin{pmatrix} 	2mn(m-n) & n^2(l - m) & m^2(n - l) \\ 	n^2(l - m) & 2nl(n-l) & l^2(m - n) \\ 	m^2(n - l) &l^2(m - n) & 2lm(l-m) \end{pmatrix} $$ then it can be verified that the conics $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2$ are given by the following equations in areal coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ $$\begin{pmatrix} 	X \\ 	Y \\ 	Z \end{pmatrix}^{\text{tr}} \Phi_{i}^{\text{areal}} \begin{pmatrix} 	X \\ 	Y \\ 	Z \end{pmatrix} = 0$$ since it can be checked that they contain $A,B,C,K,T$ and $D,E,F,K,T$ respectively. We have $$\det \Phi_1^{\text{areal}} = 2lmn(n^2 - m^2)(l^2 - n^2)(m^2 - l^2)$$ $$\det \Phi_2^{\text{areal}} = 4l^2m^2n^2(n - m)(l - n)(m - l)$$ so $$ \det \Phi_{1}^{\text{areal}} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{l}{m} \right)\left(1 + \frac{m}{n} \right)\left(1 + \frac{n}{l} \right) \det \Phi_{2}^{\text{areal}} $$ At this point I found it convenient to translate into Cartesian coordinates. If we write $$ T = \begin{pmatrix} 	p_1 & q_1 & r_1 \\ 	p_2 & q_2 & r_2 \\ 	1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$ where in Cartesian coordinates now $A = (p_1, p_2), B = (q_1, q_2), C = (r_1, r_2)$ then a point with areal coordinates $(X, Y, X)$ with $X+Y+Z=1$ has Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ given by $$\begin{pmatrix} 	x \\ 	y \\ 	1 \end{pmatrix} = T \begin{pmatrix} 	X \\ 	Y \\ 	Z \end{pmatrix}$$ (We could simplify by applying a suitable affine transformation to translate $C$ to the origin, rotate $B$ to the $y$ -axis and rescale so that $A = (p, q), B = (0, 1) $ and $C = (0, 0)$ for some $p, q$ .) Define for $i = 1$ and $2$ $$\Phi_i^{\text{cart}} = \begin{pmatrix} 	a_i & h_i & g_i \\ 	h_i & b_i & f_i \\ 	g_i & f_i & c_i \end{pmatrix} = (T^{-1})^{\text{tr}} \Phi_i^{\text{areal}} T^{-1}$$ so that $\mathcal{C}_i$ is given by the equation $$\begin{pmatrix} 	x \\ 	y \\ 	1 \end{pmatrix}^{\text{tr}}\Phi_i^{\text{cart}}\begin{pmatrix} 	x \\ 	y \\ 	1 \end{pmatrix} = 0.$$ I cannot explain why but it turns out that $a_1 = a_2, b_1=b_2, h_1=h_2.$ So in particular the discriminants of the two conics $\Delta_i = h_i^2 - a_i b_i$ are the same and both equal to: $$\frac{1}{(\det T)^2}(l + m)(l + n)(m + n)\left(l^2(m+n) + m^2(n+l) + n^2(l+m) - 6lmn\right).$$ Hence $\mathcal{C}_1$ is an ellipse/hyperbola if and only if $\mathcal{C}_2$ is an ellipse/hyperbola. I haven't looked much at edge and degenerate cases but it can be seen that $\Delta_i = 0$ contains three lines and a cubic where the zero locus of the cubic looks to result in a pair of parabolas. This also shows that our conics have the same ""orientation"" since the gradients of the major/minor axis of an ellipse and asymptotes of a hyperbola only depend on $a_i, b_i, h_i$ . (See here and here for formulas.) Now the eccentricity depends only on $a_i, b_i, h_i$ and the sign of $\det \Phi^{\text{cart}}_i$ which is the same as the sign of $\Phi_i^{\text{areal}}$ . (See here for a formula.) By the formula above, they will have the same eccentricity if $$ \left(1 + \frac{l}{m} \right)\left(1 + \frac{m}{n} \right)\left(1 + \frac{n}{l} \right) > 0.$$ This partitions the plane by lines into regions with the same/different eccentricity which I didn't initially appreciate. Basically, when they are hyperbola, sometimes they are ""on opposite sides of the asymptotes"" and sometimes the same. The parallel line property depicted above seems to hold in all non-degenerate cases so I guess this may come down to relations involving $a, b, h$ only. It would be nice have a little more insight into what is going on. For example, I still think it is interesting to ask if it can be shown more directly that $A,B,C,K,T$ are con-cyclic if and only if $D,E,F,K,T$ are con-cyclic without resorting to this much algebra. I also feel like it remains to be explained why $a_1 = a_2, b_1=b_2, h_1=h_2$ but that it might be related to the parallel line property? Update 09/02/24: Adding a few extra remarks partially in response to the dan_fulea's excellent efforts because they didn't fit as a comment. (i) I hadn't thought to draw the conic through $UVWKT$ so it's cool that this is also related as it is to $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ . Let's call this $\mathcal{C}_3(UVWKT)$ . I think the fourth circle you've defined as being the circle through $\text{circumcentre}(\triangle ABC)$ , $G(\triangle DEF), K, T,$ where $G(\triangle)$ is the centroid of $\triangle$ , is perhaps best described as the conic $\mathcal{C}_4(\text{centre}(\mathcal{C}_1)G(\triangle ABC)G(\triangle DEF)KT)$ . i.e. noticing it also passes through $G(\triangle ABC)$ we have 5 points to define it naturally in the general setting when $ABCKT$ are not necessarily concyclic. Your property that $O(C1),O(C2),O(C3),O(C4),G(\triangle DEF)$ are collinear and the distances between them are in the stated ratios seems to still hold. I suppose it might be possible to write down the equations of $\mathcal{C}_3, \mathcal{C}_4$ in areal coordinates as has been done for $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2$ to prove the general connection for these conics too. It is nice that the line through the centres of the these 4 conics is fairly easily described as the line through the centre of $\mathcal{C}_1$ (generally not the circumcentre of $ABC$ ) and the centroid of $DEF$ . (ii) I think your observation that if $\mathcal{C}_1$ is a circle then $DEF$ and $ABC$ are similar is also really nice. Notice that when they are circles, as well as your relations (*), from the equation for $\mathcal{C}_1$ we also have $a^2:b^2:c^2 = l(m^2-n^2):m(n^2-l^2):n(l^2-m^2)$ that can be used. (ii) It is easy to see from the areal coordinate equation of C1 that the isotomic conjugate of $K$ (call it $K_t$ with areal coordinates $(1/l,1/m,1/n)$ ) also lies on $\mathcal{C}_1$ . It is known that this conic $\mathcal{C}_1$ through $ABKK_t$ is a parabola if and only if $K$ (equivalently $K_t$ ) lies on the cubic curve mentioned in the original post. This cubic curve is known as the Tucker Nodal Cubic . (iii) The point $T$ is the complement of the isotomic conjugate of $K$ . I don't know if it has a specific name. (iv) There are corresponding 'isotomic analogues' of $\mathcal{C}_2$ , $\mathcal{C}_3$ , $\mathcal{C}_4$ which are quite fun to draw in which $K$ is replaced by the isotomic conjugate of $K$ . These are likewise related to $\mathcal{C}_1$ but are even more closely related to each other because these 'isotomic counterparts' also have the 'same size'. (v) The line through $K$ and $G(\triangle ABC)$ is tangent to $\mathcal{C}_2$ . The line through the isotomic conjugate of $K$ and $G(\triangle ABC)$ is tangent to $\mathcal{C}_3$ . (vi) There's so much symmetry in the equations, as well as the isotomic conjugate, I'm now wondering what happens if we permute the areal coordinates of $K$ and draw $\mathcal{C}_1$ , $\mathcal{C}_2$ , $\mathcal{C}_3$ , $\mathcal{C}_4$ again...?","Update 09/02/24: I have accepted dan_fulea's excellent efforts as an answer so that it doesn't appear as 'unanswered' because this post is no longer the well-defined question I first asked.

EDIT: I was asked to try to prove again with the hints and here is what I got: If the largest edge(wlog) $PQ$ , not on the perimeter, then we can extend the corners $P,Q$ to get a triangle with a greater altitude, and a greater width $PQ$ , which will give us a greater area, but if $PQ$ on the perimeter then we can't extend it, thus it has to be on the perimeter. Assume $P$ is not a corner, then, by the same principle as $1.$ we can extend the other two to the edges, and then extend them even more to the corners. I don't know how to infer that. I know it's not ideal prove of what I've been asked, but I guess that's the best I can do.","Let be a rectangle, and points be inside the triangle(or on it's edges).

I then supposed that is some point such that (the intersection of two of the hyperbolas), and then tossing this on the complex plane, setting to be the origin. This didn't go so well. I don't believe any bashing approaches work, I think this problem requires some sort of projective transformation. Also, it's quite a simple conjecture, so it's likely well known, but I haven't been able to find it on the internet. All help is appreciated.","\triangle ABC \mathcal{H}_A B C A \mathcal{H}_B \mathcal{H}_C \mathcal{H}_A,\mathcal{H}_B,\mathcal{H}_C \triangle ABC X |XA-XB|=|a-b|, |XB-XC|=|b-c| X","['geometry', 'conic-sections', 'conjectures']"
51,Algorithm to find the angle of a direction,Algorithm to find the angle of a direction,,"I need to translate the distance between two points into an angle from 0 to 359.

This generates a difference which I can then use to define the slopes absolute value (I know it can be done with out the absolute value if I change my code up). When the movement is within the NW_North section the angle will be 135 when the absolute value of the slope is 1 and as the slope converges on infinity the angle will be 180. The challenging thing is I need to break up all possible values into 45 separate angles but I have no idea what the correct algorithm is since it will need to be rounded to the nearest integer. Also I dont think the center is actually 2 but its close to it and it appears that as the distance between each red line doubles the slope gets squared but I could be wrong. public static int getNormalizedMovementAngle(Vector3d vector, double x, double z) {     final double zDifference = vector.getZ() - z;     final double xDifference = vector.getX() - x;     final double slope = Math.abs(zDifference / xDifference);      if(vector.getX() < x) {         if(vector.getZ() == z) return 90;         else if(vector.getZ() < z) {             if(slope == 1) return 135;             else if(slope > 1) {                 //Formula needs to go here             }         }     } } Anyways if anyone knows how I can use the slope to generate 45 different angles between NW and North please let met know thank you!!

The midpoint of the chord $PQ$ is $(-\dfrac{3}{5}, -\dfrac{3a}{5}+b)$ . Now, using the property that the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of the circle $(3,-2)$ are perpendicular we have: $\dfrac{-\dfrac{3a}{5}+b-(-2)}{-\dfrac{3}{5}-(3)} *a = -1$ $$\implies b= \dfrac{3a^2-10a+18}{5a}$$ This means we can eliminate one variable and write the equation of $L_1: y= ax+ \dfrac{3a^2-10a+18}{5a}$ From this form of $L_1$ we can get the value of the minimum value of the $y$ -intercept by differentiating $b$ . Let $b= f(a) = \dfrac{3a^2-10a+18}{5a}, f'(a) = \dfrac{3a^2-18}{5a^2}, f'(a)=0 \implies a = \pm \sqrt{6}$ . I just found this hoping we will get bounds on the y-intercept of $L_1$ .

If $DE$ is perpendicular to $AC$ with $E$ on side $BC$ , prove that the length of $CE=12$ . I have managed to prove the above result, but was unable to avoid the use of some trigonometry and algebraic manipulations. My solution is as follows: Let $M$ be the point of intersection of line segments $AC$ and $DE$ , and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $M$ to line segment $EC$ . Also, let $BC=x$ , $CE=a$ . Finally, let $\angle ACB =\theta, \angle CAD = 2\theta, \angle ACD=45^{\circ}-\theta$ . By Pythagoras' Theorem, $AC=\sqrt{AB^2+BC^2}=\sqrt{36+x^2}$ . Clearly, $\triangle{CME} \sim \triangle{CBA} \Rightarrow \frac{CM}{CE}=\frac{BC}{AC} \Rightarrow CM=CE \cdot \frac{BC}{AC}=\frac{ax}{\sqrt{36+x^2}}$ . Thus $AM=AC-MC=\sqrt{36+x^2}- \frac{ax}{\sqrt{36+x^2}}=\frac{36+x^2-ax}{\sqrt{36+x^2}} \Rightarrow \frac{CM}{AM} = \frac{ax}{36+x^2-ax}$ . Now, $\tan(2\theta)=\frac{MD}{MA}, \tan(45^{\circ}-\theta)=\frac{MD}{MC} \Rightarrow \frac{\tan(2\theta)}{\tan(45^{\circ}-\theta)}=\frac{MC}{MA}=\frac{ax}{36+x^2-ax}$ . On the other hand, $\tan(\theta)=\frac{AB}{BC}=\frac{6}{x} \Rightarrow \tan(2\theta)=\frac{2\tan(\theta)}{1-\tan^2(\theta)}=\frac{2 \cdot \frac{6}{x}}{1-\frac{36}{x^2}}=\frac{12x}{x^2-36} $ . Also, $\tan(45^{\circ}-\theta)=\frac{\tan(45^{\circ})-\tan(\theta)}{1+\tan(45^{\circ})\tan(\theta)}=\frac{1-\tan(\theta)}{1+\tan(\theta)}=\frac{1-\frac{6}{x}}{1+\frac{6}{x}}=\frac{x-6}{x+6} \Rightarrow \frac{\tan(2\theta)}{\tan(45^{\circ}-\theta)} = \frac{12x}{(x-6)^2}$ . Thus, we have $\frac{12x}{(x-6)^2}=\frac{ax}{36+x^2-ax} \Rightarrow a= (36+x^2-ax) \cdot \frac{12}{(x-6)^2} \Rightarrow a[1+\frac{12x}{(x-6)^2}]= 12 \cdot \frac{36+x^2}{(x-6)^2} \Rightarrow a \cdot \frac{x^2+36}{(x-6)^2} = 12 \cdot \frac{36+x^2}{(x-6)^2} \Rightarrow a=12$ .

Because nothing guarantees that, a priori, the last segment is the reflection of the first one. I have looked at a small introduction page at Wolfram , and they do say the following: On an elliptical billiard table, the envelope of a trajectory is a smaller ellipse, a hyperbola, a line through the foci of the ellipse, or a closed polygon (Steinhaus 1999, pp. 239 and 241; Wagon 1991).

Any hint is appreciated.","S_n(R) V_n(R) n R S_n(R) = \frac{n \pi^{\frac{n}{2}}R^{n-1}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)}\quad\text{and}\quad V_n(R) = \frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}R^{n}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)} \Gamma(z) \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty e^{-x} x^{z-1}\, dx. v s S_s(1) V_v(1) v-s? s = 7 v = 5","['calculus', 'geometry', 'recreational-mathematics']"

Find its area. I let the sides of the triangle be $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ . After using their corresponding formulas and some manipulation, I got $65 = \frac{abc}{a+b+c}$ . I'm kind of stuck here and I don't know how to proceed.","A triangle has inradius cm and a circumradius of cm. Find its area. I let the sides of the triangle be , , and .
