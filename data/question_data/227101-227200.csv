0,When is the image of a line bundle again a line bundle,When is the image of a line bundle again a line bundle,,"Hello everybody Motivation of my question Let $X$ be a scheme. Given a morphism $\mathcal{L}\overset{\beta}\to\mathcal{O}_X$ of line bundles over $X$ . I want to understand under what conditions the image $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle. I will specify my question below. To avoid trivialities, lets assume the morphism is not surjective. I already know the following results If $X$ is a smooth curve over a field, then every non-zero coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$ -submodule of a line bundle is already a line bundle*.  Because $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is coherent and non-zero, we see that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle in this case. If $X$ has the property, that every local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a PID, then  the submodule $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)_x=\mathrm{Im}(\beta_x)\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is free of rank $1$ , which implies that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is free, by finite presentedness of $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ . My question What if $X$ is a smooth scheme over a base scheme $S$ , say of relative dimension $1$ , for example? I am mainly interested in the case of a morphism $\mathcal{L}\overset{\beta}{\to} \mathcal{O}_{X_S}$ (non-surjective), where $X_S=S\times_{\mathrm{Spec}{k}}X$ where $S$ is any scheme over a field $k$ and $X$ is a smooth irreducible curve over $k$ . Under what conditions is the image $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ a line bundle? Some of my ideas Maybe one can prove that the restriction of $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ to the fibres $X_S\to \mathrm{Spec}(\kappa(s))$ are line bundles, by using the first result from above and then conclude, that $\mathrm{Im}(\beta)$ is a line bundle? Alternatively one could try to understand the properties of the local rings $\mathcal{O}_{X_S,x}$ , but I have doubts that they have any useful properties?

15,Generically transversally intersecting Schubert cycles,Generically transversally intersecting Schubert cycles,,"I have a question about the the proof of Pieri's formula from Harris' and Eisenbuds's lecture ""3264 and All That"" on page 146. Before the proof we use this terminology (see page 139): let $G=G(k,V)$ be the Grassmannian of $k$ -dimensional linear   subspaces of an $n$ -dimensional vector space $V$ . We start with one useful definition. As   we said, Kleiman’s theorem assures us (in characteristic $0$ ) that, for a general pair of   flags $\mathcal{V}= 0=V_0 \subset V_1 \subset ... \subset V_n=V$ and $\mathcal{W}$ on $V$ , the Schubert cycles $\Sigma_a(\mathcal{V}),\Sigma_b(\mathcal{W})$ intersect generically transversely. Recall, these Schubert cycles are defined as follows: Let $n-k \ge a_1 \ge a_2 \ge ... \ge a_k \ge 0$ a descending sequence considered as vector $a=(a_1,...,a_k)$ . Then $$\Sigma_a(\mathcal{V}):= \{\Lambda \in G \vert \dim(\Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-a_i}) \ge i \text{ for all } i \}$$ In this case, we can actually say explicitly what “general” means: Definition 4.4 . We say that a pair of flags $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ on $V$ are transverse if any of the   following equivalent conditions hold: (a) $V_i \cap W_{n-i} =0$ for all $i$ . (b) $\dim(V_i \cap W_{n-i})= \min(0, i +j-n)$ for all $i, j$ . (c) There exists a basis $e_1,...,e_n$ for $V$ in terms of which $$V_i =\langle e_1,...,e_i \rangle \text{ and } W_j =\langle e_{n+1-j},...,e_n \rangle$$ Additionally, we will use: Lemma 4.5 Let $\Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}), \Sigma_b (\mathcal{W}) \subset G$ be Schubert cycles defined relative to transverse   flags V and W on V . If $\Lambda \in \Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}) \cap \Sigma_b (\mathcal{W})$ is a general point of their intersection,   then: (a) $\Lambda$ does not lie in any strictly smaller Schubert cycle $ \Sigma_{a'} (\mathcal{V}) \subset \Sigma_a (\mathcal{V})$ . (b) The flags induced by $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{W}$ on $\Lambda$ (that is, consisting of intersections with $\Lambda$ with flag elements $V_{\alpha}$ and $ W_{\beta}$ ) are transverse. Note that, by the first part, the flags $\Lambda^{\mathcal{V}}$ and $\Lambda^{\mathcal{W}}$ on $\Lambda$ induced by $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are, explicitly, $$\Lambda^{\mathcal{V}}_i= \Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-a_i}$$ and $$\Lambda^{\mathcal{W}}_i= \Lambda \cap V_{n-k+i-b_i}$$ for $i=1,...,k$ . now Proposition 4.9 (Pieri’s formula). For any Schubert class $\sigma_a \in A(G) $ (the latter is the Chow Group) and any integer $b$ , $$(\sigma_b \cdot \sigma_a)= \sum_{\vert c \vert= \vert a \vert + b \text{ & } a_i \le c_i \le a_{i-1}}$$ Proof of 4.9 (Pieri's formula): [...] following the book we look at Schubert cycles $\Sigma_a (\mathcal{V}), \Sigma_b (\mathcal{U})$ and $\Sigma_{c^*}(\mathcal{W})$ defined with respect general flags $\mathcal{V},\mathcal{U},\mathcal{W}$ .

Let $\mathcal O_F$ be the integral closure of $\mathbb Z$ in $F$ . Then if I am not mistaken, a line bundle (an invertible sheaf) over $X:=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal O_F)$ is a fractional ideal of $\mathcal O_F$ . Let $\mathcal L$ be such a line bundle. Then what is $c_1(\mathcal L)\cap[X]$ as defined in stacks project 02SJ ? My thoughts: Since the dimension of $X$ is $1$ , this should be a $0$ -cycle, i.e. a finite linear combination of points of $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal O_F)$ , modulo principal divisors, namely, an element of the ideal class group of $\mathcal O_F$ . Write $\mathcal L$ , regarded as a fractional ideal as $\prod_i\mathfrak p_i^{n_i},\,n_i\in\mathbb Z\,\forall i$ , where $\mathfrak p_i$ are prime ideals of $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal O_F)$ . Then by definition $c_1(\mathcal L)\cap[X]$ is represented by $\sum_i\text{ord}_{\mathfrak p_i, \mathcal{L}}(s) [\mathfrak p_i]$ for some $s\in\mathcal L$ . Here $\text{ord}_{\mathfrak p_i, \mathcal{L}}(s)$ is defined as follows. Take an $s_i\in\mathfrak p_i$ such that $(s_i)=\mathfrak p_i\mathcal O_{F,\mathfrak p_i}$ . Then $s=s_i^{n_i}\cdot t_i$ for some $t_i\in\mathcal O_{F,\mathfrak p_i}$ . And $\text{ord}_{\mathfrak p_i, \mathcal{L}}(s):=\text{length}(\mathcal O_{F,\mathfrak p_i}/t_i\mathcal O_{F,\mathfrak p_i})$ . I think this is equal to $\text{ord}_{p_i}(t_i)$ . So if $\mathcal O_F$ is a P.I.D., then we can choose $s$ such that each $t_i$ is a unit in $\mathcal O_{F,\mathfrak p_i}$ , and hence $c_1(\mathcal L)\cap[X]=0,\,\forall\mathcal L$ . In general, I have no idea what do the orders of these $t_i$ mean, in terms of $\mathcal L$ .

41,Some extended question on bounds of Rational map,Some extended question on bounds of Rational map,,"I saw this question here : I am stuck on the same kind of question but my problem is a bit more general which thrives me to post a new one. I am copying a bit definition from that post to save some typing time. Let $\phi: \Bbb P^1 \to \Bbb P^1$ be a rational map then we define $Aut(\phi)=\{f \in PGL_2(\Bbb C): \phi^f=f^{-1}\phi f(z)=\phi(z)\}$ Here, in general, the definition of a rational map is: Let $\mathbb{P}^n$ and $\mathbb{P}^m$ be projective spaces. If $m$ homogeneous polynomials in $n+1$ variables of the same degree ""d"" give a partially defined map from $\mathbb{P}^n$ to $\mathbb{P}^m$ then this map is called a rational map. We can exactly define this on a projective variety as well. Let $\phi: \Bbb P^1 \to \Bbb P^1$ be a rational map of degree $d \geq 2$ . Then $Aut(\phi)$ is a finite subgroup of $ PGL_2(\Bbb C)$ and its order is bounded by a function of $d$ . Proof: Let $f \in Aut(\phi)$ . Then for any point $P \in \Bbb P (\Bbb C)$ and any $n\geq 1$ we have $$\phi^n(P) = (\phi^f)^n(P ) = (f^{-1}\phi^nf) (P )$$ , and hence $$f (\phi^n(P )) = \phi^n(f( P))$$ . In particular, if P is a periodic point of (primitive) period n, then f (P) is also a periodic point of (primitive) period n. Thus each $f \in Aut(\phi)$ induces a permutation of each of the sets $Per_n (\phi)$ and $Per_n^{**} (\phi )$ , where $Per_n (\phi)$ and $Per_n^{**} (\phi )$ are the collection of periodic point and premitive peiodic points of period $n$ . [so $P\in  Per_n (\phi)$ means $\phi^n(P)=P$ and $P\in  Per_n^{**} (\phi)$ means n is the smallest natural no such that $\phi^n(P)=P$ holds. Choose three distinct integers $n_l, n_2, n_3$ such that $\phi$ contains primitive n periodic points for each value of n. Now we have a result that says that we can find such values, and further that their magnitude can be bounded solely in terms of d. More precisely, they may be chosen from among the first d+ 5 primes. Letting $$N_i =|Per_{n_i}(\phi)|\geq 1$$ for $$i=1,2,3$$ , the action of $\phi$ on the sets of primitive periodic points yields a homomorphism $$Aut(\phi) \to S_{N_1} \times S_{N_2} \times S_{N_3}...................(1)$$ from $Aut(\phi)$ into a product of three symmetric groups. We claim that the homomorphism (1) is injective. To see this, we observe that any f in the kernel of (1) fixes each $Per_{n_i}^{**} (\phi )$ ; hence f fixes at least three points in $\Bbb P^1(\Bbb C)$ ; hence f is the identity map. Thus the homomorphism (1) is injective, which implies that $Aut (\phi)$ is finite. This ends the proof. Now I have some questions: Can we extend this result for $n=2$ . I have some idea here that we don't have finite periodic points in $\Bbb P^2$ but finite indeterminacy locus. Can we exploit that? Can anyone please give me a written answer or some steps to do that? I feel that in $\Bbb P^3$ is infinite, if not, how to prove that? If yes then can anyone give me one example of the rational map $\phi:\Bbb P^3 \to \Bbb P^3$ where $Aut(\phi)$ is infinite. Remember we defined $Aut(\phi)=\{f \in PGL_2(\Bbb C): \phi^f=f^{-1}\phi f(z)=\phi(z)\}$ . Now we are going to define $BiRat(\phi)=\{f$ a birational map $: \phi^f=f^{-1}\phi f(z)=\phi(z)\}$ . For the sake of simplicity, you can take a birational map to be a rational map with the rational inverse. Then clearly $Aut(\phi) \subseteq BiRat(\phi)$ . Now the question is for $n=2$ . Is $|BiRat(\phi)|=\infty$ ? Otherwise give me an example of rational or biration map $\phi$ for which $|BiRat(\phi)|<\infty$ ? This one is for those who are familiar with the Cremona group . Can we find a finite subgroup of the Cremona group $Cr(2)$ or $Cr(n), n\geq 3$ ? Give me one specific example. Thanks in advance.

In it, he gives an alternative proof of a result I asked about in this question . Let $X$ be an affine variety over an algebraically closed field $k$ , $A=\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ , and $\mathcal{F}$ a coherent sheaf on $X$ . Let $x\in X$ , $\mathfrak{m}_x=\{f\in A\mid f(x)=0\}$ , and $k(x)=A/\mathfrak{m}_x$ . Then the function $$\varphi(x)=\dim_{k(x)}(\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x))$$ is upper semi-continuous. I'll go through his reasoning and my thoughts so far. Since $\mathcal{F}$ is coherent, I have taken an $A$ -module $M$ with $\mathcal{F}=\widetilde{M}$ . He starts by saying that by Nakayama's Lemma we have that $\varphi(x)$ is the minimum number of generators of the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x$ -module. Here is my attempt to justify this: Suppose $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ generate $\mathcal{F}_x=M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x=A_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ module, with $n$ minimal. Then for any $m\in\mathcal{F}_x$ we can find $a_i\in A$ , $f\in A\setminus\mathfrak{m}_x$ such that $$m=\frac{a_1}{f}x_1+\cdots+\frac{a_n}{f}x_n$$ (we can assume a common denominator by taking terms into the $a_i$ ). Since $k(x)$ is a field we can find $g\in A$ with $fg-1\in\mathfrak{m}_x$ . Then for $b_i=a_ig$ we have $m=b_1x_1+\cdots+b_nx_n$ in $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)=M/\mathfrak{m}_xM$ and so $\varphi(x)\leq n$ . Conversely, suppose that $\varphi(x)=l$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_l$ generate $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)$ over $k(x)$ . Now, $\mathcal{F}\otimes_A k(x)=\mathcal{F}_x/\mathfrak{m}_x\mathcal{F}_x$ , so by Nakayama's Lemma there exists some $f\in A\setminus\mathfrak{m}_x$ such that the $x_i$ generate $(M_{\mathfrak{m}_x})_f$ as an $A_f$ -module. But $(M_{\mathfrak{m}_x})_f=M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ since $f\notin\mathfrak{m}_x$ , and $A_f\subseteq A_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ , so they certainly generate $\mathcal{F}_x$ as an $\mathcal{O}_x$ -module. Then $n\leq\varphi(x)$ , so $\varphi(x)=n$ as desired. He goes on to say that if $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ form a minimal set of generators, then they generate $\mathcal{F}$ in some neighbourhood. From my justification of the first statement, it appears that this neighbourhood would be $D(f)$ . We know they generate $M_{\mathfrak{m}_x}$ as an $A_f$ -module, but I'm not sure how this would show they generate $M_f$ . I also can't see why we would need to use the minimum number of generators for this step in particular to be true.

How to prove that $\pi \colon \tilde{X} \to X$ is finite? Is it even correct in general? I'm thinking of something like the blow up of $V(y^2 - x^2 - x^3)$ . If I  consider $V(y^2 - x^2 - x^3, xs-yt)$ in $\mathbb{A}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ and go to the chart $t=1$ I get the equation $s^2 - 1 - x$ where I easily see, that $s$ in integral over $k[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2 - x^3)$ . On the chart $s=1$ , I can't see it that easily or if I go to a chart where one of the points in the fiber over $0$ is missing I don't get a finite morphism. My idea was to use relationship affine + proper = finite for morphism of schemes like here https://lovelylittlelemmas.rjprojects.net/proper-affine-finite/ . But Im not very familiar with (non)-affine schemes. So it is known that a blowing up is proper. And the closed immersion of the strict transform in the blow up is proper too? Because I can find a chart with all points of the fiber over $0$ , $\pi$ must be affine too? and is then finite. My questions are now: 1) Is this argumentation correct? 2) I actually only need the fact $\mathrm{Spec}(A[x]) \to \mathrm{Spec}(B[x])$ is closed, where $A$ and $B$ are the coordinate rings of (affine) $\tilde{X}$ resp. $X$ ,  which follows from $\tilde{X} \to X$ universally closed. Is there a more elementary way to see this. 3) How can I easily prove that $\pi$ is quasi-finite, i.e. the fiber over $0$ finite? Can I see more easily, that $\pi$ is affine? 4) The whole argumentation shouldn't be true for blow ups at ideals with dimension > 0, otherwise I could finitely desingularize every variety.

Consider $\mathbb{P}^2$ with homogeneous coordinates $x_i$ , $0\leq i\leq 2$ , and $\mathbb{P}^5$ with homogeneous coordinates $a_{ij}$ , $0\leq i\leq j\leq 2$ . Then let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^5$ defined by the equation $$\sum_{0\leq i\leq j\leq 2} a_{ij} x_i x_j = 0.$$ This comes equipped with a natural projection map $\pi : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{P}^5$ . We will think of a point in $\mathcal{C}$ as a pair $(p,C)$ where $C$ is a plane conic and $p$ is a point on it. In $\mathbb{P}^2$ , we fix a point $q$ and a line $\ell$ .

Thank you very much.","V(f = y^2 - x^3 - x^2) t=y/x k[x,y] (k[x,y]/f) \to k[x,y,t]/\langle y-tx, t^2 - (x+1) \rangle s=1 S^{-1}( k[x,y,t]/\langle y-tx, t^2 - (x+1) \rangle) (𝑘[𝑥,𝑦]/𝑓)_{\langle x,y \rangle} S = A \backslash \langle x,y \rangle A c \mathfrak{m} c s B A \to B s B_{\nu_i} \nu_1, \ldots, \nu_k \mathfrak{m} B S = A \backslash \mathfrak{m} S^{-1}B \overline{A_{\mathfrak{m}}} S^{-1}B A t = y/x k[x,y]","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-curves', 'blowup']"
