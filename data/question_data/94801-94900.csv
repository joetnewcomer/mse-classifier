0,Error in the Chudnovsky Formula,Error in the Chudnovsky Formula,,"The Chudnovsky formula $$\frac{1}{\pi} = 12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (545140134k + 13591409)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 \left(640320\right)^{3k + 3/2}}$$ is generally quoted as converging towards $\pi$ with a linear rate of convergence of 14 decimal places per iteration. However, when having looked for the exact analytic value, I can't seem to find a proof of this anywhere, or even an asymptotic error function describing it, having searched in a proof of the formula for the words 'convergence' and 'error', and only having found unrelated results. I considered the method proposed at the bottom of this page , however the method posted here only works for superlinear formulae - a category into which this shouldn't fall, unless all the sites claiming it to be linear are completely wrong. My final idea was to use a method I'd seen once using the Taylor series to prove the rate of convergence of the Newton Raphson method. However this method appears to require that the function be expressed in the form: $$x_{n+1} = g(x_n)$$ Which means I can't really see any obvious way of rewriting so as to exclude $n$ from the formula. And pretty much any variation on the word 'error' I enter into Google tends to come up with people trying to find errors in their algorithm. Any direction on how to solve this, or to a paper which includes a proof of it, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time! EDIT: Having written this, I since found the following comment , which relates to my question of finding an exact value for asymptotic convergence, but I still don't know why this would be true. From further testing the value given in the linked comment seems to be derived from the reciprocal of the value found in the ratio test, but I still have little idea as to why this is true!","The Chudnovsky formula is generally quoted as converging towards with a linear rate of convergence of 14 decimal places per iteration.

Let $L$ be a complex linear space and let $M$ be a real   even-dimensional subspace. Let $H$ be a positive definite Hermitian   form on $L$ . Then $H = S + iA$ where $S$ is symmetric and $A$ is   alternating . Let $\{ m_1,...,m_{2k} \} $ be a basis of $M$ which is   orthonormal with respect to $S$ . Then $$ | A ^k ( m_1 , . . . , m_{2 > k} ) | \le  k !$$ with equality holding precisely when $M$ is a   complex $k$-dimensional subspace of $L$ . (Here $A^k$ is the $k$-th   exterior power of $A$ .) By a suitable shuffling of the basis it can be arranged that $A ^k ( > m_1 , . . . , m_{2 k} ) \ge 0$ Let $z_1, . . . , z_n$ be coordinates on complex $n$ - space   $\mathbb{C}^n$ and set $$\omega = \frac{i}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n dz_j \wedge d \overline{z}_j$$ This is the fundamental $2$-form of the standard Kahler structure on   $\mathbb{C}^n$ and  at each point $p \in \mathbb{C}^n$ $\omega_p$ is   the alternating part of the positive definite Hermetian form: $$\sum_{j=1}^n dz_{j(p)} \cdot d \overline{z}_{j(p)}$$ on the tangent space to $\mathbb{C}^n$  at $p$. Therefore , if $\mathcal{M}$ is any smoothn $2k$-dimensional manifold   immersed in $\mathbb{C}^ n$ , Wirtinger's Inequality implies   immediately that: $$\int_{\mathcal{M}} \frac{1}{k!} \omega ^k \le \int_{\mathcal{M}} 1 \ d > \mathcal{M} = \text{Volume} _{2k}(\mathcal{M})$$ with equality is and only if $ \mathcal{M}$ is a complex   $k$-dimensional manifold.

My questions are: Could you explain to me how we use the fact that $\omega$ is the fundamental $2$-form of the standard Kahler structure on $\mathbb{C}^n$ to apply the Wirtinger inequality here?

Let $L$ be a complex linear space and let $M$ be a real   even-dimensional subspace. Let $H$ be a positive definite Hermitian   form on $L$ . Then $H = S + iA$ where $S$ is symmetric and $A$ is   alternating . Let $\{ m_1,...,m_{2k} \} $ be a basis of $M$ which is   orthonormal with respect to $S$ . Then $$ | A ^k ( m_1 , . . . , m_{2 > k} ) | \le  k !$$ with equality holding precisely when $M$ is a   complex $k$-dimensional subspace of $L$ . (Here $A^k$ is the $k$-th   exterior power of $A$ .) By a suitable shuffling of the basis it can be arranged that $A ^k ( > m_1 , . . . , m_{2 k} ) \ge 0$ Let $z_1, . . . , z_n$ be coordinates on complex $n$ - space   $\mathbb{C}^n$ and set $$\omega = \frac{i}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n dz_j \wedge d \overline{z}_j$$ This is the fundamental $2$-form of the standard Kahler structure on   $\mathbb{C}^n$ and  at each point $p \in \mathbb{C}^n$ $\omega_p$ is   the alternating part of the positive definite Hermetian form: $$\sum_{j=1}^n dz_{j(p)} \cdot d \overline{z}_{j(p)}$$ on the tangent space to $\mathbb{C}^n$  at $p$. Therefore , if $\mathcal{M}$ is any smoothn $2k$-dimensional manifold   immersed in $\mathbb{C}^ n$ , Wirtinger's Inequality implies   immediately that: $$\int_{\mathcal{M}} \frac{1}{k!} \omega ^k \le \int_{\mathcal{M}} 1 \ d > \mathcal{M} = \text{Volume} _{2k}(\mathcal{M})$$ with equality is and only if $ \mathcal{M}$ is a complex   $k$-dimensional manifold. Also each $\frac{1}{k!} \omega ^k $ is an exact $2k$ form. My questions are: Could you explain to me how we use the fact that $\omega$ is the fundamental $2$-form of the standard Kahler structure on $\mathbb{C}^n$ to apply the Wirtinger inequality here?

31,The boundary of a region for complex-valued functions,The boundary of a region for complex-valued functions,,"From Chapter $3$ of Stein and Shakarchi's complex analysis book, we have the following problem ($15$): Show that if $f$ is holomorphic in the unit disc (open), bounded, and converges uniformly to zero in the sector $\theta<\arg z<\varphi$ as $|z|\to1$, then $f=0$. We're supposed to use either the Cauchy inequalities or maximum modulus principle (per the instructions at the beginning, since this is a $4$-part problem), but I don't quite see how to do it using either of those, though the structure of the problem seems to lend itself to the maximum modulus principle. The problem with this is that we know that in the interior of the sector, the function cannot attain a maximum modulus, however, we don't know anything about the boundary of the sector that is in the interior of the circle. This is one obstacle I couldn't quite overcome. My approach was to extend the function past the boundary of the circle, which we can do since $f$ is bounded (I think, though even this part is a little bit 'hand-wavy'), and then, since it has a cluster of zeros, the function will be identically zero. How should I approach the problem with the intention of using the maximum modulus principle or Cauchy inequalities? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: I've been thinking about this problem, and I've come up with the following solution: Let $f$ be an analytic function on $\mathbb{D}$ (take note that I'm not assuming $f$ is bounded), with the property that for $\theta<\arg z<\varphi$, $|f(z)|$ converges to zero uniformly as $|z|\to1$ in this sector. Then we can make a 'bump' on the disc in this sector so that it extends in this outside of $\mathbb{D}$, call this set $\Omega'$. Define $$g(z)=\begin{cases}f(z)&:\,z\in\Bbb D\\0 &:z\notin\Bbb D\end{cases}.$$ Now, clearly in $\Bbb D$ $g(z)$ is holomorphic and outside of $\Bbb D$, it's holomorphic as it's constant, so the only questionable part would be on the boundary of the disc in this sector. At this point, we can take a small disc around each point entirely contained in $\Omega'$, since it's open, and apply Morera's theorem to show that $g(z)$ is holomorphic here. Therefore, on all of $\Omega'$, $g$ is holomorphic and has a cluster of zeros, hence is identically equal to zero, therefore $f(z)=0$. Is this proof correct?

45,Why is direct analytic continuation not transitive?,Why is direct analytic continuation not transitive?,,"Consider the following definitions and remarks which will be referenced in the question: Defn ( Direct analytic continuation) A function element in a domain $U$ is a pair $(f, D)$ where $D$ is a subdomain of $U$ and $f$ is an analytic function on $D$ . Two function elements $(f,D)$ and $(g,E)$ are equivalent, write $(f,D) \sim (g,E)$ if $D \cap E \neq 0$ and $f = g$ on $D \cap E$ . We say $(g,E)$ is a direct analytic continuation of $(f,D)$ . Why do we make such a definition? We know the power series $$\sum_{r \geq 0}z^k = \frac{1}{1-z}$$ is defined on $D(0,1)$ and cannot be extended to any larger domain due to natural boundary. However, $\frac{1}{1-z}$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{C} \backslash \{1\}$ so sometimes the domain forced by the definition of a function is not the maximal possible. In other words, sometimes we are looking at the ""correct"" function with a ""wrong"" domain. Defn (Analytic continuation along path) We say $( g, E )$ is an analytic continuation of $(f, D)$ along $\gamma$ if $\gamma : [0,1] \rightarrow 0$ and there exist function elements $(f_i, D_i), i \in \{ 0, \ldots , n \}$ and $0 = t_o < t_2 < \cdots < t_n = 1$ such that $$(f, D) = (f_0, D_0) \sim (f_1, D_1) \sim \cdots \sim (f_{n - 1}, D_{n - 1}) \sim (f_{n}, D_{n}) = (g, E)$$ and $\gamma \left( \left[ t_j, t_{j + 1} \right] \right) \subseteq D_j$ for $j \in \{ 0, \ldots, n - 1 \}$ . Write $(f, D) \approx_{\gamma} (g, E)$ . Remark As $\mathbb{C}$ has a path-connected basis for the topology, domain are path-connected. Defn (analytic continuation) We say $(g, E)$ is an analytic continuation of $(f,D)$ if there exists a path $\gamma$ such that $(f, D) \approx_{\gamma} (g, E)$ . In this case we write $(f,D) \approx (g, E)$ . Remark If $(f, D) \approx_{\gamma} (g, E)$ and $(f, D) \approx_{\gamma} (h, E)$ then $g = h$ by repeated application of the identity principle.

I split up the integral as a sum of residues: $$ I \ = \  2\pi i \cdot Res_{z=-1}\frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2\cdot(z-1)} \ + 2 \pi i \cdot Res_{z=1}\frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2\cdot(z-1)} $$ The rightmost part becomes $2 \pi \cdot 1^3/(1+1)^2 \ = \ \pi i /2$. The same trick can't be applied for the the other part. There was another lemma that was useful though: $$ Res_{z=1}f(x) \ = \  \frac{1}{(2-1)!} \cdot  \lim_{z \rightarrow -1}\left( (z+1)^2 \cdot \frac{z^3}{(z+1)^2(z-1)}\right) \ = \ \frac{1}{(1+1)^2} \ = \ \frac{1}{4} $$ Now I should multiply this by $2 \pi i$, which gives me $\pi \cdot i /2$. Adding gives us $\pi i $. Could you please check what I did and tell me if I this is the right way to solve this?","I want to find $$ I \ = \ \int_{C(0,2)^+} \frac{z^3}{z^3+z^2-z-1} $$ First of all, I know that $z^3+z^2-z-1 = (z+1)^2(z-1)$.
