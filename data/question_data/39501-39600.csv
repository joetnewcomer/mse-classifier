2,What is exactly the meaning of being isomorphic?,What is exactly the meaning of being isomorphic?,,"I know that the concept of being isomorphic depends on the category we are working in.

To begin with, there are different systems of axioms, all of them trying to define that object called geometry. So if we are talking about the same object, I suppose the theories generated should be isomorphic each other. Does this make sense? Again what is the real implication of being isomorphic? According to the definition there should be a bijection between the sets, which means that it cannot be larger sets (with a higher cardinality, or even different cardinality) that hold the propierties of the given structure and also the operations defined on each structure should be mantained in the bijection.

26,Center of the Quaternions: Proof and Method,Center of the Quaternions: Proof and Method,,"I have to calculate the center of the real quaternions, $\mathbb{H}$. So, I assumed two real quaternions, $q_n=a_n+b_ni+c_nj+d_nk$ and computed their products.  I assume since we are dealing with rings, that to check was to check their commutative product under multiplication.  So i'm looking at $q_1q_2=q_2q_1$.  When I do this, I find that clearly the constant terms are identical, so it is clear that the subset $\mathbb{R}$ is in the center.  So, perhaps then that $\mathbb{C}\le\mathbb{H}$.  However i ended up, after direct calculation with the following system; $$c_1d_2=c_2d_1$$ $$b_1d_2=b_2d_1$$ $$b_1c_2=b_2c_1$$ So the determination is then found by solving this system.  Intuitively, I felt that this lead to $0$'s everywhere and thus the center of $\mathbb{H}$, $Z(\mathbb{H})=\mathbb{R}$.  I then checked online for some confirmation and indeed it seemed to validate my result.  However, the proof method used is something I haven't seen.  It was pretty straight forward and understandable, but again, I've never seen it.

Considering the first equation, assume that $d_1=1$ (since it is arbitrary, it's value can be any real...).  This leads to  $$c_1=\frac{c_2}{d_2}$$ And that this  is a contradiction, since $c_1$ is no longer arbitrary (it depends on $c_2$ and $d_2$) I really like this proof method, although it is unfamiliar to me.

If we work in a set theory without Zorn's lemma/AC, is it still true that every commutative ring has the invariant basis number?","The proof I know that every commutative ring has the invariant basis number property involves quotienting by a maximum ideal to get a field, and so reducing to the case where the commutative ring is a field, for which the result is already proven. I wondered if there might be a ""direct"" proof, and tried to formalize it like this. The fact that every commutative ring has a maximal ideal is proven with Zorn's lemma, and I suspect is in fact equivalent to Zorn's lemma.

91,How to prove the ring of Laurent polynomials over a field is a principal ideal domain?,How to prove the ring of Laurent polynomials over a field is a principal ideal domain?,,"Disclaimer: this is a homework question. I'm looking for direction, not an answer. Given a field $F$ , show that $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is a principal ideal domain. I'm unsure how to proceed. Would it be better to prove this directly? (ie, let $I$ be an ideal, show that $I = (f)$ for some $f \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ ). The proof that polynomials are a PID would involve (I imagine) division by remainder and use of degree, both of which don't seem to have obvious parallels for Laurent polynomials. Should I try and devise some parallels and mimic the proof for polynomials? Or is this overkill? (or just wrong?) edit 1 : I guess the approach I mentioned above amounts to showing that Laurent polynomials are a euclidean domain (we know that euclidean domain => principle ideal domain, so this would be sufficient) Are they a euclidean domain though? (it seems like this would have been the question if they were, instead of asking if they were a PID). edit 2 : I've spat this out, think most parts of it are correct, though it seems kind of ugly/cumbersome (but that might just be me trying to spell things out more than is needed): Given a Laurent polynomial $f \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ , define its ""negative   degree"" $\deg^-(f)$ to be the largest power of $x^{-1}$ that appears   in $f$ . Let $I$ be an ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ . Note that $\{x^{-\deg^-(f)}f \mid f \in I\} \subseteq F[x]$ . Let $J$ be the   ideal in $F[x]$ generated by this set. $F[x]$ is a principal ideal   domain, so $J$ is a principal ideal and we have $J = (j)$ for some $j \in F[x]$ . We claim $I = (j)$ (now meaning an ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ ). Let $f \in I$ . Then $x^{-\deg^-(f)}f \in J$ , meaning $f = x^{\deg^-(f)}g$ , where $g = x^{-\deg^-(f)}f$ is in $J$ . Because $g \in J = (j)$ , there exists $g' \in F[x]$ such that $g = g'j$ , and thus $f = (x^{\deg^-(f)}g')j$ is a multiple of $j$ , so $f \in (j)$ . Let $f \in (j)$ . Then $f = gj$ for some $g \in F[x,x^{-1}]$ . But note   that $j = x^{-\deg^-(f')}f'$ for some $f' \in I$ , so $f = gx^{-\deg^-(f')}f'$ , so $f$ is a multiple of an element of an ideal $I$ , so $f$ itself is in $I$ . This shows $I = (j)$ . So an arbitrary ideal of $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is   principal, so $F[x,x^{-1}]$ is a principal ideal domain. I kind of feel like I still don't ""get"" the proof (I more-or-less see how each part works with the others but I'm having trouble seeing the bigger picture), though this may be due to a poor handle on ideals in general.","Disclaimer: this is a homework question. I'm looking for direction, not an answer. Given a field , show that is a principal ideal domain. I'm unsure how to proceed. Would it be better to prove this directly? (ie, let be an ideal, show that for some ). The proof that polynomials are a PID would involve (I imagine) division by remainder and use of degree, both of which don't seem to have obvious parallels for Laurent polynomials. Should I try and devise some parallels and mimic the proof for polynomials? Or is this overkill? (or just wrong?) edit 1 : I guess the approach I mentioned above amounts to showing that Laurent polynomials are a euclidean domain (we know that euclidean domain => principle ideal domain, so this would be sufficient) Are they a euclidean domain though? (it seems like this would have been the question if they were, instead of asking if they were a PID). edit 2 : I've spat this out, think most parts of it are correct, though it seems kind of ugly/cumbersome (but that might just be me trying to spell things out more than is needed): Given a Laurent polynomial , define its ""negative   degree"" to be the largest power of that appears   in . Let be an ideal of . Note that . Let be the   ideal in generated by this set. is a principal ideal   domain, so is a principal ideal and we have for some . We claim (now meaning an ideal of ). Let . Then , meaning , where is in . Because , there exists such that , and thus is a multiple of , so . Let . Then for some . But note   that for some , so , so is a multiple of an element of an ideal , so itself is in . This shows . So an arbitrary ideal of is   principal, so is a principal ideal domain.

95,Where is the symmetric group hidden in the Yoneda lemma?,Where is the symmetric group hidden in the Yoneda lemma?,,"In extension to the question Yoneda-Lemma as generalization of Cayley`s theorem? , can someone point out to me where, in the categorical notation and analyzation of the Cayley's theorem, the symmetrc group of transformations of the group elements is? Put another way: I see that the group structure is found under the set of all the transformation of the group elements and so the group is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group. But the symmetric group is a very big object (e.g. for $\mathbb{Z_3}$ with its 3 elements, $S_3$ has 3!=6 elements) and I don't find it in the Yoneda lemma. Put another way: Cayley's theorem says something about a subset, basically that $G$ is isomorphic to some transformation on $G$, let's name it $\lambda(G)$, and the insight is $\lambda(G)\le S(G)$. As the Yoneda lemma only has an equal (or isomorphic) sign, I wonder where the $\le$ symbol is in the categorical language. I can only assume that the lemma $F(A)=\text{nat}(\text{hom}(A,-),F)$ translates to $G=\lambda(G)$ if one plugs in the hom functor for $F$ and the resulution to my question would then be to see what the $S(G)$ is in terms of $\text{nat}(\text{hom}(A,-),F)$ and why.
