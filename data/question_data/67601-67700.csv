1,Dinner party courses needed to have everyone sit with everyone else (repeats allowed),Dinner party courses needed to have everyone sit with everyone else (repeats allowed),,"There are a large number of similar questions on this site, but most of them seem to have an additional constraint that I do not have.

The problem/challenge has the following requirements: Input: $n$ and $m$ as dimensions of a grid Expected output: the amount of unique paths complying to the rules below: All paths start at the origin $[0,0]$ You can only travel upwards or towards the right (in increments of 1 step) Paths will wrap-around to the other side (which is the main difference with other similar questions linked below) Only count the paths which end up back at the origin $[0,0]$ , without visiting any other coordinates more than once.

Two other valid paths would be to simply move up five times or move right five times. Let me start by saying what I do know based on some earlier questions : To calculate all unique paths for an $n$ by $m$ grid using only the directions up and right, the following formula can be used: $$a(n,m) = \binom{n+m}{n} = \binom{n+m}{m}$$ i.e. for $n=3, m=4$ the output would be: $$a(n,m) = \binom{3+4}{3} = \binom{3+4}{4} = 35$$ However, with the requirements and rules above, the expected output for $n=3, m=4$ is supposed to be $66$ .

As each driver enters the park, he drives to his favourite space. If it is empty, he parks there. Otherwise, he continues along the line and parks in the first free space. If all spaces between his favourite and $n$ are taken, he leaves in disgust. Show that, out of the $n^n$ choices of favourite spaces that the drivers can make, just $(n+1)^{n-1}$ lead to all drivers parking successfully. Now, my question is whether my (attempt of ) solution is wrong and what a different approach could be. Here's my idea: proving the claim by (a kind of) induction. It is easy to verify truthfulness for $n=1$ and $n=2$ , so having this base case, we shall prove that if the claim holds for all $1\le n\le k$ , then it does also for $n=k+1$ . Let us assume WLOG there is an already established order of appearance of the drivers, since a different order yields the same number of successful choices: it just suffices to swap the drivers. Let us call $d_m$ the space chosen by the $m$ -th driver. Now, consider the cases in which $d_1=1$ . By inductive hypothesis, the other drivers have $n^{n-2}$ successful choices. In fact, the same goes for all the other $n-1$ choices of the first driver, so that in total, as a ""first outcome"", we have $\color\red{n^{n-1}}$ successful choices. We somewhat can do the same reasoning with the second driver, but we must keep in mind that for each of his choices, we have already counted those in which the first driver occupies the other spaces. For example, we need to subtract the successful cases in which at the same time $d_2=1$ and $d_1=2$ : that is $(n-1)^{n-2}$ . This happens for all the spaces not chosen by the second driver, and so we actually need to subtract $(n-1)^{n-1}$ . Finally, letting vary $d_2$ yields the ""second outcome"" $\color\red{n^{n-1}-n(n-1)^{n-1}}$ . And so on, and so on. The final outcome would be the sum of all the red expressions.

22,Motivation behind using complex numbers in combinatorics,Motivation behind using complex numbers in combinatorics,,"There's a common technique in couting/tiling problems in  Olympiad which is to use complex numbers.

The solution to the above problem is to let $\zeta = e^{\frac{2i\pi}{n}}$ and let $x_j$ be the number of subsets of $A$ such that $|X| = p$ and $m(X) \equiv j \mod p$ ($m(X)$ denotes $\sum_{i \in X} x$).

32,Improving clarity and argumentation with hard-to-describe combinatorial proof,Improving clarity and argumentation with hard-to-describe combinatorial proof,,"I'm doing undergraduate research and the content of my paper depends on the following lemma. I tried something like a combinatorial proof, but it is clearly not rigorous, partly because my argument is hard to describe. How can I improve my proof? Lemma. Let $p_i$ give the $i$th prime. Then the number of ways we can uniquely distribute $k_1$ [color-one] balls, $k_2$ [color-two] balls, $k_3$ [color-three] balls, ... $k_f$ [color-$f$] balls into $n$ indistinguishable boxes is equal to the number of ways to factor $$\prod_{i=1}^f p_i^{k_i}$$ into $n$ distinct factors. Before we begin our proof, we start with a demonstration. Suppose we sought to uniquely distribute 2 blue balls and 1 red ball into 3 indistinguishable boxes. We'd have the following distributions (each distribution has its own row): $$[\color{blue}{* *}\color{red}{*}] \, \, \, []\, \, \,[] $$ $$[\color{blue}{* *}] \, \, \, [\color{red} *] \, \, \, []$$ $$[\color{blue} *] \, \, \, [\color{blue} * \color{red} *] \, \, \,  []$$ $$[\color{blue} *] \, \, \, [ \color{blue} * ] \, \, \, [ \color{red} *]$$ Now suppose we sought to generate unique factorizations of $12=2^2 \cdot 3^1$ into $3$ factors. We'd have the following factorizations (each factorization has its own row, and blanks spaces represent multiplications by $1$): $$\color{blue}{2 \cdot 2} \cdot \color{red} 3 *  \, \, \, * $$ $$\color{blue}{2 \cdot 2} * \color{red} 3 * \, \, \,$$ $$\color{blue} 2 * \color{blue} 2 \cdot \color{red} 3 * $$ $$\color{blue} 2 * \color{blue} 2 *  \color{red} 3$$ Note that the number of factorizations we have is the same as the number of distributions. Our factorization process is identical to the distribution process, except we replace blue balls with $2$s, replace red balls with $3$s, and consider groups of balls as products of factors. We generalize this observation below. Proof. Consider a ball distribution for some $k_1, k_2, ..., k_f$. Recall that within each box, the order of the balls does not matter. Likewise, in a product of primes, a clear ""order"" of its factors does not exist. In each box, balls of the same color are indistinguishable. Likewise, in a product of primes, repeats of the same factor are not distinguishable (as a consequence of the previous remark about prime products). Furthermore, in each box, balls are immutable; they cannot be broken up into more balls, and so each group of balls is unique. Likewise, as each ""ball"" (i.e. factor) in each group of factors is prime, no factor group can be broken up into an syntactically different factor group, and so each group of separated factors (e.g. $2^1, 2^1 \cdot 3^1, \emptyset$) are separated factors in the third row in the example above) is unique. Lastly, the order of groups between each of the boxes does not matter. Likewise, the order of each of the separated factors does not matter, as a clear ""order"" of its factors does not exist. Therefore, each color of balls can be replaced by a specific prime number, and the product of these prime numbers is $\prod_{i=1}^f p_i^{k_i}$, which we seek to separate into $n$ separated factor groups, i.e. $n$ distinct factors. If there's a way to prove this that isn't explicitly combinatorial, I would appreciate that as well, especially if it is simpler.","I'm doing undergraduate research and the content of my paper depends on the following lemma. I tried something like a combinatorial proof, but it is clearly not rigorous, partly because my argument is hard to describe. How can I improve my proof? Lemma. Let $p_i$ give the $i$th prime. Then the number of ways we can uniquely distribute $k_1$ [color-one] balls, $k_2$ [color-two] balls, $k_3$ [color-three] balls, ... $k_f$ [color-$f$] balls into $n$ indistinguishable boxes is equal to the number of ways to factor $$\prod_{i=1}^f p_i^{k_i}$$ into $n$ distinct factors. Before we begin our proof, we start with a demonstration. Suppose we sought to uniquely distribute 2 blue balls and 1 red ball into 3 indistinguishable boxes. We'd have the following distributions (each distribution has its own row): $$[\color{blue}{* *}\color{red}{*}] \, \, \, []\, \, \,[] $$ $$[\color{blue}{* *}] \, \, \, [\color{red} *] \, \, \, []$$ $$[\color{blue} *] \, \, \, [\color{blue} * \color{red} *] \, \, \,  []$$ $$[\color{blue} *] \, \, \, [ \color{blue} * ] \, \, \, [ \color{red} *]$$ Now suppose we sought to generate unique factorizations of $12=2^2 \cdot 3^1$ into $3$ factors. We'd have the following factorizations (each factorization has its own row, and blanks spaces represent multiplications by $1$): $$\color{blue}{2 \cdot 2} \cdot \color{red} 3 *  \, \, \, * $$ $$\color{blue}{2 \cdot 2} * \color{red} 3 * \, \, \,$$ $$\color{blue} 2 * \color{blue} 2 \cdot \color{red} 3 * $$ $$\color{blue} 2 * \color{blue} 2 *  \color{red} 3$$ Note that the number of factorizations we have is the same as the number of distributions. Our factorization process is identical to the distribution process, except we replace blue balls with $2$s, replace red balls with $3$s, and consider groups of balls as products of factors. We generalize this observation below. Proof. Consider a ball distribution for some $k_1, k_2, ..., k_f$. Recall that within each box, the order of the balls does not matter. Likewise, in a product of primes, a clear ""order"" of its factors does not exist. In each box, balls of the same color are indistinguishable. Likewise, in a product of primes, repeats of the same factor are not distinguishable (as a consequence of the previous remark about prime products). Furthermore, in each box, balls are immutable; they cannot be broken up into more balls, and so each group of balls is unique. Likewise, as each ""ball"" (i.e. factor) in each group of factors is prime, no factor group can be broken up into an syntactically different factor group, and so each group of separated factors (e.g. $2^1, 2^1 \cdot 3^1, \emptyset$) are separated factors in the third row in the example above) is unique. Lastly, the order of groups between each of the boxes does not matter. Likewise, the order of each of the separated factors does not matter, as a clear ""order"" of its factors does not exist. Therefore, each color of balls can be replaced by a specific prime number, and the product of these prime numbers is $\prod_{i=1}^f p_i^{k_i}$, which we seek to separate into $n$ separated factor groups, i.e. $n$ distinct factors.

69,Parity of Ramanujan's Tau Function,Parity of Ramanujan's Tau Function,,"I have been working problems out of Ram Murty's ""Problems in the Theory of Modular Forms,"" which has been marvelous. His solutions are complete, but are way too slick for satisfaction (probably by his design). So, I'm taking the exercise of filling in the gaps of understanding. Exercise 1.5.1 has had me exploring for some time. The intent appears to be merely an application of Jacobi's Triple Product Formula. It just seems like overkill to me and I'm wondering if there's a more forward way using triangular numbers. Here's the problem. Define $\tau(n)$ by $$q\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1-q^n)^{24}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\tau(n)q^n$$ Show that $\tau(n)$ is odd iff $n=(2m+1)^2$ for some $m$ . The first thing I did was change the $-$ to a $+$ , since we're working $(\text{mod }2)$ . Then, it's natural to use Kummer's Theorem to weed out the even binomial coefficients. This can be done in two ways, $$\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1+q^n)^{24}=\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1+q^{8n})^3 (\text{mod }2)$$ or $$\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1+q^n)^{24}=\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1+q^{8n}+q^{16n}+q^{24n})(\text{mod }2)$$ The first way is the one Murty uses before he wraps up summarily with Jacobi's Triple Product Formula $$\Pi_{n=1}^\infty(1-q^n)^3=\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k(2k+1)q^{k(k+1)/2}$$ Both ways should end up using the nice touch that odd squares are one more than $8$ times triangular numbers (substitute $q^{8}$ for $q$ ). More Basic Approach If we instead want to use the top product, all that's left is to expand in another way. I'm hoping the intricacy of Jacobi's formula will unravel some, since we are working in $(\text{mod }2)$ . Particularly, my hope is to set $y=(1,2,3,4,\dots)$ and use $$\tau(8n+1) = \text{card}(X_n)$$ where $$X_n=\{x\in\{0,1,2,3\}^\infty: x\cdot y=n\}$$ Next, I think it is natural to look at sequences in $$S=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}^\infty: x\cdot y=0\}$$ which are generated by addition/subtraction of elements of the form $$(\dots, 0, 0, 1,-1, 0, 0, \dots, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, \dots)$$ Then, $\tau(8n+1)$ is something like the size of ""orbits"" of $S$ acting on $X_n$ (of course $S$ is not technically an action because it's not closed). Interest The reason I'm interested is that $X_n$ has an odd number of elements precisely when $n$ is a triangular number, i.e. when $(1,1,\dots,1,1,0,0,0,\dots)\in X_n$ . So, I'm hoping there is a nice involution of $X_n$ that only fixes the point beginning with $n$ 1's, then all zeros, $(1,1,\dots,1,1,0,0,0,\dots)$ . The parity problem would be solved immediately.

You have 11 socks (5 red socks and 6 blue socks) and 4 drawers. What is the number of ways that you can distribute 11 socks into 4 drawers?

80,"Maximizing the number of ""discrepancies"" in a vertex-labeled graph","Maximizing the number of ""discrepancies"" in a vertex-labeled graph",,"I am working on a modeling project whose mathematical formalism uses 2D integer periodic lattices. The problem I'm actually interested in can be generalized to the following graph theory problem, which might perhaps be easier by virtue of there being less structure available. Given a fixed undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and an arbitrary function $F : V \to \{ 1,2,\dots,|V| \}$ (not necessarily injective or surjective), we define $$B(F,v)=\# \{ u \in V : (u,v) \in E \text{ and } F(u) \geq F(v) \}$$ where $\#A$ is the number of elements in a finite set $A$. The occurrences being counted here are called bonds experienced at the site $v$. We then define: $$D(F)=\sum_{v \in V} \# \{ u \in V : (u,v) \in E \text{ and } F(u)>F(v) \text{ and } B(F,u)>B(F,v) \}.$$ Each of the occurrences being counted in this sum is called a discrepancy between $u$ and $v$ in favor of $u$. I want to understand the optimization problem of choosing $F$ to make $D(F)$ as large as possible. Some initial intuition follows: Discrepancies are possible. An example of a labeled graph with a discrepancy is  $V=\{ 1,2,3,4 \},E=\{ (1,2),(2,3),(2,4) \}$ (the ""T"" graph) labeled with $F(1)=2,F(2)=2,F(3)=2,F(4)=1$. Then there will be a discrepancy between $2$ and $4$ in favor of $2$. However, discrepancies are ""unusual"" because if $F(u)>F(v)$ then a bond is experienced to $u$ at $v$ but not vice versa. So vertices with higher values of $F$ will tend to have fewer bonds, especially if the degree of all vertices is constant (as in the cases of interest to me). My limited thoughts on the problem: The obvious bound on $D(F)$ is $\sum_{v \in V} \operatorname{deg}(v)-B(F,v)$, which is what you get if you just forget about the $B(F,u)>B(F,v)$ part. But my experiments show that at least in the class of graphs I am interested in (2D rectangular periodic lattices) $D(F)$ is much smaller. For instance this bound might be about $200$ while the actual value of $D$ is about $5$. Some alternative ways to formulate the problem: We can forget about $F$ and think purely in terms of an arbitrary total preorder on $V$. Unfortunately we cannot specialize to actual orders, because $F$ was allowed to be non-injective. We can pose everything in graph theory language. To do this, we take $G$ and then half-remove edges from it to make a directed graph. In this framework, a discrepancy occurs when there is a directed edge from $v$ to $u$ and the out-degree of $u$ (counting both directed edges and undirected edges) is higher than that of $v$. The problem with this formulation is that we cannot simply half-remove edges willy-nilly: we have to remove them in such a way that there are no cycles containing directed edges. Yet we still have more leeway than in the case of constructing an acyclic orientation of an undirected graph, because purely undirected cycles are OK (and in particular, the original graph is OK, though it has zero discrepancies).","I am working on a modeling project whose mathematical formalism uses 2D integer periodic lattices.

It is given that, $\lfloor{\frac{a}{b}}\rfloor = 2^{s-2}$. Claim: If $n!= 2^s  \times a \times b $ and  $\lfloor{\frac{a}{b}}\rfloor = 2^{s-2}$, then $a$ has $90 \% $ primes less than $n$ as factor. Proof: Here,  $\nu_ p(n)$ denotes the p-adic valuation of $n$ and $s_p(n)$  denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of $n$, so, $\nu _{p}(n!)={\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}}$  ($\textit{Legendre's formula}$). For $p = 2 $, we obtain $\nu _{2}(n!)= n-s_{2}(n)$, where $s_{2}(n) $ is the number of $1$'s in the binary representation of $n$. The number of primes less than $n$ is denoted by $\pi(n)$. By $\textit{Prime  Number Theorem}$, $\pi(n)\approx  \frac{n}{\log n}$.

It is given that, $\lfloor{\frac{a}{b}}\rfloor = 2^{s-2}$. Claim: If $n!= 2^s  \times a \times b $ and  $\lfloor{\frac{a}{b}}\rfloor = 2^{s-2}$, then $a$ has $90 \% $ primes less than $n$ as factor. Proof: Here,  $\nu_ p(n)$ denotes the p-adic valuation of $n$ and $s_p(n)$  denotes the sum of the standard base-p digits of $n$, so, $\nu _{p}(n!)={\frac {n-s_{p}(n)}{p-1}}$  ($\textit{Legendre's formula}$). For $p = 2 $, we obtain $\nu _{2}(n!)= n-s_{2}(n)$, where $s_{2}(n) $ is the number of $1$'s in the binary representation of $n$. The number of primes less than $n$ is denoted by $\pi(n)$. By $\textit{Prime  Number Theorem}$, $\pi(n)\approx  \frac{n}{\log n}$. Since,  $\lfloor{\frac{a}{b}}\rfloor = 2^{s-2} $ $\implies \log_2(a )-\log_2(b)= \log_2 (2)^{s-2}$ [ignoring a quantity $<1$ on R.H.S] $ \implies  \log_2(a )-\log_2(b )=n- s_2(n)-2$ $ \implies  \sum_{p \mid a}\log_2( p ^{\nu _{p}(n!)})-\sum_{q \mid b}\log_2( q ^{\nu _{q}(n!)})=n- s_2(n)-2 \dots (2)$ Equation $(2)$ implies that, $\sum_{p \mid a}\log_2( p ^{\nu _{p}(n!)})-\sum_{q \mid b}\log_2( q ^{\nu _{q}(n!)}) >0  \cdots  (3)$ Now, we consider the smallest prime factor, $p_0$ of $a$ and the biggest prime factor$q_0$ of $b$.

94,Using Burnside's Lemma in GAP to handle special variations of the Rubik's Cube?,Using Burnside's Lemma in GAP to handle special variations of the Rubik's Cube?,,"If you want to count the number of distinct positions of a standard 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube simple counting arguments will suffice: There are 8 corners, all distinct The 8 corners can be in any permutation (because a quarter turn is an odd cycle) The twist of the 8th corner is determined by the twist of the other 7 There are 24 orientations of the cube that must be accounted for $$\frac{8! \cdot 3^7}{24} = 3674160$$ But there is an implicit assumption in this calculation that each counted position occurs 24 times, once for each orientation of the cube.  When this is true the $8! \cdot 3^7$ overcounts by a factor of 24.  Since every corner on a normal 2x2x2 is unique there is no extra symmetry and this assumption is true. But there are variations on a 2x2x2 like the following: On this 2x2x2 there are two identical all-white corners and six identical red and yellow corners along the equator.  The position shown has extra symmetry (e.g. rotating by $120^{\circ}$ through the axis that keeps the white corners stationary). Now if you try to use simple counting arguments you run into trouble: $$\frac{\frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} \cdot 3^6}{24} = \frac{1701}{2}$$ Obviously $\frac{1701}{2}$ can't be right since it isn't even a whole number.  The problem is that with the extra symmetry, Burnside's Lemma must be used.  Thanks to Jaap Scherphuis this isn't too hard to do by hand: 24 rotations are: Identity rotation: All $\frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} \cdot 3^6 = 20412$ positions stay the same if you don't rotate it. $\pm 120^{\circ}$ corner rotation: There are $8$ of such rotations. The two white corners must lie on the axis, and the other 6 pieces form two orbits of 3 pieces. The only freedom we have is to orient each orbit, so there are $3^2$ position that stay the same under such a rotation. $\pm 90^{\circ}$ degree face rotation: There are $6$ of these rotations, but there is no position that has this symmetry. We only get 4-cycles, and don't have 4 pieces of each type. $180^{\circ}$ face rotation: There are $3$ of these rotations. The pair of white pieces can be in 4 pairs of locations. The other 6 pieces form 3 pairs that can be oriented at will, so there are $4 \cdot 3^3$ positions with this symmetry. $180^{\circ}$ edge rotation: There are $6$ of these rotations. This is the same as above, $4 \cdot 3^3$ positions with this symmetry. Putting all that together: $$\frac{(1 \cdot 20412) + (8 \cdot 3^2) + (6 \cdot 0) + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 3^3)) + (6 \cdot (4 \cdot 3^3))}{24} = 894$$ So there are 894 distinct positions for this 2x2x2 variation (which matches the output of a program I wrote to enumerate them all). But, if you want to use GAP you run into the same problem.  Using the labels in the above image: # Turn U face TU := (1, 2, 3, 4)(5, 7, 9, 11)(6, 8, 10, 12); # Rotate whole puzzle around U face RU := (1, 2, 3, 4)(5, 7, 9, 11)(6, 8, 10, 12)       (13, 15, 17, 19)(14, 16, 18, 20)(21, 22, 23, 24); # Rotate whole puzzle around L face RL := (5, 6, 14, 13)(1, 7, 22, 20)(2, 15, 21, 12)       (4, 8, 23, 19)(3, 16, 24, 11)(10, 9, 17, 18);  # The whole 2x2x2 cube group custom222 := Group([TU, RU, RL]);  # The 24 orientations of a 2x2x2 custom222o := Group([RU, RL]);  gap> Size(custom222o); 24  gap> Size(custom222) / 24; 3674160  samecolors := [[1, 5, 12, 16, 17, 23],[3, 7, 10, 14, 19, 21],                [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24]];  gap> (Size(custom222) / Size(Stabilizer(custom222, samecolors, OnTuplesSets))) / 24; 1701/2 Note that the samecolors list identifies which stickers are indistinguishable and the Stabilizer() call finds the group of positions that are all identical.  Unfortunately GAP is running into the same issue as the naive calculation and not taking into account positions that have extra symmetry. I would like to use GAP to apply Burnside's Lemma and get the correct value of 894.  You can see that I defined the custom222 using only 3 generators where the first is a face turn and the other two are $90^{\circ}$ rotations of the whole puzzle about different axes.  It's these rotations that define the 24 orientations of the cube and I suspect I'll have to use another group with just these two orientation generators to guide GAP about the specifics of what positions are considered identical.

It seems to have something to do with ConjugacyClasses() but I don't understand the details. Note that this question isn't really about this specific 2x2x2.  If I can figure out how to use GAP with Burnside's Lemma on this simple 2x2x2 I should be able to handle much more complex puzzles like this one that defy manual applications of Burnside's Lemma. So, how do I use GAP with Burnside's Lemma to analyze variations on the Rubik's Cube like the one I've shown here?","If you want to count the number of distinct positions of a standard 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube simple counting arguments will suffice: There are 8 corners, all distinct The 8 corners can be in any permutation (because a quarter turn is an odd cycle) The twist of the 8th corner is determined by the twist of the other 7 There are 24 orientations of the cube that must be accounted for $$\frac{8! \cdot 3^7}{24} = 3674160$$ But there is an implicit assumption in this calculation that each counted position occurs 24 times, once for each orientation of the cube.  When this is true the $8! \cdot 3^7$ overcounts by a factor of 24.  Since every corner on a normal 2x2x2 is unique there is no extra symmetry and this assumption is true. But there are variations on a 2x2x2 like the following: On this 2x2x2 there are two identical all-white corners and six identical red and yellow corners along the equator.  The position shown has extra symmetry (e.g. rotating by $120^{\circ}$ through the axis that keeps the white corners stationary). Now if you try to use simple counting arguments you run into trouble: $$\frac{\frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} \cdot 3^6}{24} = \frac{1701}{2}$$ Obviously $\frac{1701}{2}$ can't be right since it isn't even a whole number.  The problem is that with the extra symmetry, Burnside's Lemma must be used.  Thanks to Jaap Scherphuis this isn't too hard to do by hand: 24 rotations are: Identity rotation: All $\frac{8!}{2! \cdot 6!} \cdot 3^6 = 20412$ positions stay the same if you don't rotate it. $\pm 120^{\circ}$ corner rotation: There are $8$ of such rotations. The two white corners must lie on the axis, and the other 6 pieces form two orbits of 3 pieces. The only freedom we have is to orient each orbit, so there are $3^2$ position that stay the same under such a rotation. $\pm 90^{\circ}$ degree face rotation: There are $6$ of these rotations, but there is no position that has this symmetry. We only get 4-cycles, and don't have 4 pieces of each type. $180^{\circ}$ face rotation: There are $3$ of these rotations. The pair of white pieces can be in 4 pairs of locations. The other 6 pieces form 3 pairs that can be oriented at will, so there are $4 \cdot 3^3$ positions with this symmetry. $180^{\circ}$ edge rotation: There are $6$ of these rotations. This is the same as above, $4 \cdot 3^3$ positions with this symmetry. Putting all that together: $$\frac{(1 \cdot 20412) + (8 \cdot 3^2) + (6 \cdot 0) + (3 \cdot (4 \cdot 3^3)) + (6 \cdot (4 \cdot 3^3))}{24} = 894$$ So there are 894 distinct positions for this 2x2x2 variation (which matches the output of a program I wrote to enumerate them all). But, if you want to use GAP you run into the same problem.  Using the labels in the above image: # Turn U face TU := (1, 2, 3, 4)(5, 7, 9, 11)(6, 8, 10, 12); # Rotate whole puzzle around U face RU := (1, 2, 3, 4)(5, 7, 9, 11)(6, 8, 10, 12)       (13, 15, 17, 19)(14, 16, 18, 20)(21, 22, 23, 24); # Rotate whole puzzle around L face RL := (5, 6, 14, 13)(1, 7, 22, 20)(2, 15, 21, 12)       (4, 8, 23, 19)(3, 16, 24, 11)(10, 9, 17, 18);  # The whole 2x2x2 cube group custom222 := Group([TU, RU, RL]);  # The 24 orientations of a 2x2x2 custom222o := Group([RU, RL]);  gap> Size(custom222o); 24  gap> Size(custom222) / 24; 3674160  samecolors := [[1, 5, 12, 16, 17, 23],[3, 7, 10, 14, 19, 21],                [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24]];  gap> (Size(custom222) / Size(Stabilizer(custom222, samecolors, OnTuplesSets))) / 24; 1701/2 Note that the samecolors list identifies which stickers are indistinguishable and the Stabilizer() call finds the group of positions that are all identical.  Unfortunately GAP is running into the same issue as the naive calculation and not taking into account positions that have extra symmetry. I would like to use GAP to apply Burnside's Lemma and get the correct value of 894.  You can see that I defined the custom222 using only 3 generators where the first is a face turn and the other two are $90^{\circ}$ rotations of the whole puzzle about different axes.  It's these rotations that define the 24 orientations of the cube and I suspect I'll have to use another group with just these two orientation generators to guide GAP about the specifics of what positions are considered identical. For example, using the group of the 24 rotations of the cube I can get the number and types of symmetries of the cube which are needed by Burnside's Lemma: gap> List(ConjugacyClasses(custom222o), Size); [ 1, 6, 3, 8, 6 ] I think this problem is nearly identical to There are 5472730538 essentially different Sudoku grids but I don't see how they used GAP to apply Burnside's Lemma.
