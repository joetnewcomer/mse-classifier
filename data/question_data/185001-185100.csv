Why must this be true?","Question: Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary sets, with $\alpha:A\rightarrow B$ an injection. Show how to define $\beta:B\rightarrow A$ such that $\alpha \beta$ is the identity function on $A$. Solution: For $a\in A$ define $(a\alpha)\beta=a$. For $b\in B$, $b\neq a\alpha$ for any $a$, define $b \beta=a_{1}\in A$. Source: Groups: A Path To Geometry by R. P. Burn. Chapter: 1 Question: 24 The injection has the property $x\alpha=y\alpha \Rightarrow x=y$. My problem lies in understanding this statement ""For $b\in B$, $b\neq a\alpha$ for any $a$, define $b \beta=a_{1}\in A$"". Does ""$b\neq a\alpha$ for any $a$"" mean that no image of any $a\in A$ can be equal to itself? Why must this be true?",,['functions']

How to define an injective function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow A$ without using the choice axiom? My effort: Let $$f(1) \colon= f_1(1).$$ Now as $f_2 \colon \{1, 2\} \longrightarrow A$ is injective, we must have $f_2(1) \neq f_2(2)$ . So we can conclude that either $f_2(1) \neq f_1(1)$ or $f_2(2) \neq f_1(1)$ . That is, either $f_2(1) \neq f(1)$ or $f_2(2) \neq f(1)$ . So the set $f \big(\{1, 2 \}\big) - f\big(\{1 \}\big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_1$ be the smaller  element of the set $\{1,2\}$ such that $f_2 \left(k_1 \right) \neq f_1(1)$ . We define $f(2) \colon= f_2 \left( k_1 \right)$ . Then $f(2) \neq f(1)$ . Now $f_3 \colon \{1, 2, 3\} \longrightarrow A$ is injctive, so the set $f_3\big(\{1,2,3\}\big)$ has exactly three elements, whereas the set $f\big(\{1,2\}\big)$ has exactly two elements. Thus the set $f_3\big(\{1,2,3\}\big) - f\big(\{1,2\} \big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_2$ be the smallest element of the set $\{1, 2, 3, \}$ such that $f_3 \left( k_2 \right) \not\in f\big(\{1,2\}\big)$ . Let's define $f(3) \colon= f_3 \left( k_2 \right)$ . Then $f(3) \not\in f\big(\{1,2\} \big)$ . So $f(3) \neq f(1)$ and $f(3) \neq f(2)$ . Suppose that $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n \geq 2$ , and suppose also that $f(1), \ldots, f(n)$ have beeen defined so that $f(i) \neq f(j)$ for any $i , j\in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ such that $i \neq j$ . Now as the function $f_{n+1} \colon \{ 1, \ldots, n+1 \} \longrightarrow A$ is injective, the set $f_{n+1}\big( \{1, \ldots, n+1 \}\big)$ has exactly $n+1$ elements. On the other hand, the set $f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ has exactly $n$ elements. So the set $f_{n+1}\big(\{1, \ldots, n+1 \}\big) - f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ has at least one element. Let $k_n$ be the smallest element of the set $\{1, \ldots, n+1\}$ such that $f_{n+1} \left(k_n \right) \not\in f\big(\{1,\ldots, n\}\big)$ . So let's define $f(n+1) \colon= f_{n+1} \left( k_n \right)$ . Obviously, $f(n+1) \neq f(i)$ for any $i \in \{1, \ldots, n \}$ . In this way, we have defined a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow A$ such that $f(m) \neq f(n)$ for any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m>n$ . Is this proof good enough?

Sorry about my English, but it is not my native language.","Be $S^1$ the unit circle in the plane, that is, $S^1=  \lbrace (x,y)  : x^2+y^2=1 \rbrace$ with the subspace topology. Show that $S^1 - \lbrace (1,0)\rbrace$ is homeomorphic to the open interval $(0,1)$. I have an idea. Using this theorem: Let $f:(X, \tau_1) \rightarrow (Y, \tau_2)$ be a homeomorphism. Let $a \in X$, so that $X - \lbrace a \rbrace$ is a subspace of $X$ and has induced topology $\tau_3$. Also, $Y-\lbrace f(a)\rbrace$ is subspace of $Y$ and has induced topology $\tau_4$. Then $(X - \lbrace a \rbrace, \tau_3)$ is homeomorphic to $(Y-\lbrace f(a)\rbrace, \tau_4)$. (Morris, ""Topology without tears"", remark 4.3.6) My idea is to make $X=S^1$ and $Y=(0,1) \cup ?$ so, with the respective topologies using the theorem, $S^1-\lbrace (1,0)\rbrace$ is homeomorphic to $(0,1)$.  But I'm stuck in the part of defining $Y$ and find the homeomorphism $f$ between $X$ and $Y$. PD.
