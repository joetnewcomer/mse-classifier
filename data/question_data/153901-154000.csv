6,Proof that $\sqrt{F!-1}$ is irrational,Proof that  is irrational,\sqrt{F!-1},"Please tell me whether my proof is valid. (1) Suppose $\sqrt{F!-1}= \frac p q$ where $p, q$ are integers $>0$ with no common factors.  (If there are any common factors we cancel them in the numerator and denomintor. (2) Squaring both sides, we get $F!-1= \frac {p^2} {q^2}$. (3) The expression $F!-1$ is whole.  Because $p$ and $q$ have no common factors, the only way $\frac {p^2} {q^2}$ can be whole is if $q^2=1$. (4) Therefore, $F!-1=p^2$. (5) Note that $F!-1$ is a form of $3k-1$. (6) No square can equal any $3k-1$.  A number is either $3j-1$, which squared becomes $3m+1$; or $3j$, which squared becomes $3m$; or $3j+1$, which squared becomes $3m+1$.  Thus, no square can equal any $3k-1$. (7) Therefore, $F!-1$, being a form of $3k-1$, cannot equal $p^2$, which is a direct contradiction to (4). (8) The only resolution to the contradiction is that our supposition of (1) must be false, and $\sqrt{F!-1}$ cannot equal any $\frac p q$; consequently, it is irrational.

By equidistributed, I mean equidistributed in residue classes, as defined here (the definition is very intuitive, and examples of such equidistributed sets are provided on that page). My goal here is to prove that if $S$ is equidistributed and contains enough elements (see here ), then $S+S$ covers all the positive integers except a finite number of them. The first step, I think, would be to prove that $S+S$ is equidistributed. I d guess the proof is not difficult and this fact has probably been established, but I could not find a reference. The result seems obvious if you consider ""equidistribution modulo 1"" instead, so I suppose it can also be derived (probably in a similar way) for ""equidistribution in residue classes"", as the two concepts are closely related and based on a similar Weyl criterion (a continuous version for modulo 1, a discrete version for residue classes.) Special case If the infinite set $S$ of positive integers is such that if $x,y\in S$ then $x+y\notin S$ , it is easy to prove that $S$ equidistributed implies $S+S$ is also equidistributed. Note that $S$ is called a Sidon set or sum-free set .

The sets that I am interested in all have $b>\frac{1}{2}$ , for instance, pseudo-primes ( $a=b=c=1$ ) or pseudo-superprimes ( $a=b=1, c=2$ ). Such sets satisfy this conjecture A (see here ) : all but a finite number of positive integers can be written as $z=x+y$ with $x, y \in S$ . That conjecture would imply that $S+S$ is de facto equidistributed, since essentially, in this case $S+S$ it is the set of all positive integers minus a finite number of them. However, that conjecture A is precisely what I would want to prove, so I can not use it as a justification to establish the much weaker result that $S+S$ is supposedly equidistributed if $b>\frac{1}{2}$ and $S$ is equidistributed. If $b\leq \frac{1}{2}$ , conjecture A is not true. Hints to prove the result and win the bounty In case it is not true, a counter-example will do. Assuming it is correct, a sketch of a proof for a simple case is enough. Here is how it could start. Let $T = S+S$ and $$S(n,q) = \{x\in S, x=q \bmod{n}\}.$$ We have $$T(n,q) = \bigcup_{p=0}^{n-1}\Big[S(n,p) + S(n,(q-p) \bmod{n} )\Big]$$ $$T=\bigcup_{q=0}^{n-1}T(n,q)$$ $T(n,q)$ is the subset of elements of $T$ that are equal to $q$ modulo $n$ . The subsets $T(n,q)$ for any given $n>1$ form a partition of $T$ . However the first union for $T(n,q)$ consists of potentially overlapping sets, making the problem non-trivial. Proving the result consists in proving that for any integer $n>1$ and $0\leq q,q'<n$ we have $$\frac{N_{T(n,q)}(z)} {N_{T(n,q')}(z)}\rightarrow 1 \mbox{ as } z\rightarrow \infty.$$ Again $N_T(z)$ counts the number of elements of $T$ less than or equal to $z$ . We can focus on sets $S$ such that $$N_S(z) \sim \frac{a z^b}{(\log z)^c} $$ with $0\leq b \leq \frac{1}{2}$ . I will offer the bounty even if the proof is only for the special case $b=\frac{1}{2}, c=0$ and $n=2$ . For computer experiments (generating such a set $S$ that is supposed to be equidistributed), proceed as follows: the positive integer $k$ belongs to $S$ if and only if $U_k < a/(2\sqrt{z})$ where the $U_k$ 's are independent uniform deviates on $[0, 1]$ . I did some experiments and here are the results, using $n=12, b=\frac{1}{2}$ and looking at all elements of $S$ and $T=S+S$ up to $10^6$ : Equidistribution in $S$ (modulo $n=12$ in this case) means that the ""Ratio_1"" tend to be identical and equal to $\frac{1}{n}$ as you look at more and more elements of $S$ , while equidistribution in $T$ means that the ""Ratio_2"" tend to be identical also converging to $\frac{1}{n}$ . I also did the same test on the set $S$ of perfect squares, which is notoriously not equidistributed. The results are below. Final notes: For perfect squares, $a=1, b=\frac{1}{2}, c=0$ . Even though $T$ , the set of sums of two perfect squares is not equidistributed, the set $T+T$ is the set of all non-negative integers, and is thus equidistributed (that set of course has $a=0, b=1, c=0$ ). The last table suggests that the equations $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 3$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 7$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+ 11$ do not have integer solutions, while $x^2 + y^2 = 12z$ , $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+6$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 12z+9$ might have only finitely many solutions.","By , I mean with .

I don't know whether the limit exists or not, but as I explained above, lower bound of the limit is  $$ q_{n}=\lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{\#\{f(x):disc(f)\text{ is square-free}\}}{\#\{f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]:f(x)\text{ is monic irreducible polynomial of degree $n$}, h(f)\leq N\}}. $$ For example, in case of $n=2$, we have $$ q_{2} = \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{\{a, b\in \mathbb{Z}:|a|, |b|\leq N, a^{2}-4b\text{ is square-free}\}}{\{a, b\in \mathbb{Z}:|a|, |b|\leq N, a^{2}-4b\text{ is not square}\}} $$ Edit : With computer, I computed $q_{2}$ and N=10 -> 0.6 N=100 -> 0.454497 N=500 -> 0.425595 N=1000 -> 0.419174 N=5000 -> 0.41124 and my computer doesn't work for $N=10000$..",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

Fact : $[1,2,3,\cdots,(n-3),(n-1),n]\times n=[1,1,1,\cdots, 1,1,1]$ (with $n$ $1$ s) Using this fact, we can see $$\begin{align}[1,2,3,\cdots, (n-3),(n-2),n]\times k&=[1,1,1,\cdots,1,1,1]\div n\times k\\&=[1,1,1,\cdots,1,1,1]\times k\div n\\&=[k,k,k,\cdots,k,k,k]\div n.\end{align}$$ In the following, let us consider in mod $n$ .

42,Uses of Vieta Jumping in research mathematics?,Uses of Vieta Jumping in research mathematics?,,"Vieta jumping has been a prominent method for solving Diophantine equations since 1988. It was popularized when it was used to solve an IMO problem, but has it been applied to research mathematics, and applied in solving previously unsolved questions? Context: Vieta Jumping is a method of showing that for quadratics $f$ and $g$ , if two positive integers $A, B$ satisfy $f(A,B)|g(A,B)$ , then there is a method to generate $A'$ such that $f(A',B)|g(A',B)$ where $A'$ is always larger/smaller than $A$ . We can then continue applying this method to generate infinitely many unique pairs of numbers of the form $(x,B)$ such that $f(x,B)|g(x,B)$ . The method is as follows: Suppose $f(A',B)|g(A',B)$ and $$\frac{g(A,B)}{f(A,B)}=k$$ for some positive integer $k$ . Then, this implies $$g(A,B)-kf(A,B)=0$$ We can then rewrite this as a quadratic in terms of $A$ . As this is a quadratic, there exists some $A'$ which is also a root of $g(x,B)-kf(x,B)=0$ . We can then use Vieta's formulae to show that $A'$ is a positive integer, and also that $A'$ is larger/smaller than $A$ . Hence, there are infinitely many solutions to the diophantine equation $\frac{f(x,y)}{g(x,y)}=k$ . If $A'\leq A$ , then Vieta Jumping can be used as a form of infinite descent.

So far, ten solutions are known; five are ""small"" while the other five are surprisingly large.

After expanding a few terms (up to $q^{15000}$) of the left hand side of the identity, I strongly believe the following identity holds: $$\left(\sum_{G_n = 0 \pmod 5}(-1)^nq^{G_n}\right)\left(\sum_{G_n = 2 \pmod 5}(-1)^nq^{G_n}\right) + \left(\sum_{G_n = 1 \pmod 5}(-1)^nq^{G_n}\right)^2 = 0.$$ I am in particular interested in a proof of the last identity. Update: Here is what I tried. Denote by $$F_k(q) := \sum_{G_n=k\pmod 5}(-1)^nq^{G_n}.$$ Notice that $G_n = 1 \pmod 5$ if and only if $n = 1 \pmod 5$, and $G_{5k+1} = 1 + 25G_{-k}$. This would give $F_1(q) = q\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{25m})$ using the pentagonal number theorem .

70,Proving that $\omega(N)\neq4$ for an odd perfect number $N$ by hand,Proving that  for an odd perfect number  by hand,\omega(N)\neq4 N,"Let $\omega(n)$ denote the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, and let $N$ be an odd perfect number. It is not difficult to show that $\omega(N)\ge3$. In fact, Nocco already proved this in 1863. Showing that $\omega(N)\neq3$ requires a little more effort, but the proof is still fairly short. I will present some version of the proof below; the original one is due to Peirce in 1830 (which, interestingly, seems to have been published before Nocco's proof). The two key ideas here are the geometric series and the factor chain method. Let $N=\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}$ be the prime factorization of $N$. Then it follows that $$\sigma(N)=\prod_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=0}^{e_i} p_i^j=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{p_i^{e_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}.$$ This formula is useful, because each factor is necessarily greater than one when $e_i$ is positive, which is the case for all prime factors $p_i$. Hence $\sigma(N)\ge\sigma\left(\displaystyle\prod_{i\in{I}} p_i^{e_i}\right)$, where $I\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. The second idea is perhaps even more fundamental, because we have yet to use the property of perfectness. Since $\sigma(N)=2N$, every divisor of $\sigma(N)$ must also divide $2N$; the other way around is not as interesting. In particular, every factor $\frac{p_i^{e_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$ must divide $2N$. This result is really powerful; for example, observing that $2^1||2N$ yields Euler's well-known form of an odd perfect number after some algebra. With these tools in our toolbox, the proof is almost immediate. Let $p^\alpha$, $q^\beta$, and $r^\gamma$ be three odd prime powers with $p<q<r$ and assume that $N=p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma$ is an odd perfect number. By the same token as above, we see that $$\begin{align*}\sigma(N)=\sigma(p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma) &= \frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q^{\beta+1}-1}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r^{\gamma+1}-1}{r-1} < \frac{p^\alpha p}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q^\beta q}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r^\gamma r}{r-1}\\\implies& \frac{\sigma(N)}{N} = \frac{\sigma(p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma)}{p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma} < \frac{p}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r}{r-1}.\end{align*}$$ Suppose that $p=5$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\cdot\frac{11}{10}=\frac{77}{48}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $p=3$. Suppose that $q=7$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\cdot\frac{11}{10}=\frac{77}{40}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $q=5$. Suppose that $r=17$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{17}{16}=\frac{255}{128}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $r \le 13$. In consequence, we have three possible cases to consider: $r=7$, $r=11$, and $r=13$. In the first case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 7^\gamma$. By the factor chain method, $3^1||N$ implies $4|2N$ and $7^1||N$ implies $8|2N$, neither of which is possible. Hence $\alpha\ge2$ and $\gamma\ge2$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} \ge \frac{\sigma(3^2\cdot5\cdot7^2)}{3^2\cdot5\cdot7^2} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{7^2}\right)=\frac{494}{245}>2,$$ which is impossible, but we already knew that $105=3\cdot5\cdot7$ cannot divide an odd perfect number. In the second case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 11^\gamma$. Suppose that $\beta=1$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} = \frac{\sigma(3^\alpha\cdot5\cdot11^\gamma)}{3^\alpha\cdot5\cdot11^\gamma} < \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{11}{10} = \frac{99}{50} < 2,$$ which is impossible ( could we know that beforehand? ). Hence $\beta\ge2$. By the factor chain method, $\alpha\ge4$ and $\gamma\ge4$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} \ge \frac{\sigma(3^4\cdot5^2\cdot11^4)}{3^4\cdot5^2\cdot11^4} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{3^4}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5^2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{11} + \frac{1}{11^2} + \frac{1}{11^3} + \frac{1}{11^4}\right)=\frac{99851}{49005}>2,$$ which is impossible, but we already knew that $825=3\cdot5^2\cdot11$ cannot divide an odd perfect number. In the third case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 13^\gamma$. $\beta=1$ implies deficiency, so $\beta\ge2$. Now, $\alpha=2$ also implies deficiency, so $\alpha\ge4$. By the factor chain method, we must have $\gamma\ge2$, which this time implies abundance.

It is not difficult to show that $\omega(N)\ge3$. In fact, Nocco already proved this in 1863. Showing that $\omega(N)\neq3$ requires a little more effort, but the proof is still fairly short. I will present some version of the proof below; the original one is due to Peirce in 1830 (which, interestingly, seems to have been published before Nocco's proof). The two key ideas here are the geometric series and the factor chain method. Let $N=\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i}$ be the prime factorization of $N$. Then it follows that $$\sigma(N)=\prod_{i=1}^k \sum_{j=0}^{e_i} p_i^j=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{p_i^{e_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}.$$ This formula is useful, because each factor is necessarily greater than one when $e_i$ is positive, which is the case for all prime factors $p_i$. Hence $\sigma(N)\ge\sigma\left(\displaystyle\prod_{i\in{I}} p_i^{e_i}\right)$, where $I\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. The second idea is perhaps even more fundamental, because we have yet to use the property of perfectness. Since $\sigma(N)=2N$, every divisor of $\sigma(N)$ must also divide $2N$; the other way around is not as interesting. In particular, every factor $\frac{p_i^{e_i+1}-1}{p_i-1}$ must divide $2N$. This result is really powerful; for example, observing that $2^1||2N$ yields Euler's well-known form of an odd perfect number after some algebra. With these tools in our toolbox, the proof is almost immediate. Let $p^\alpha$, $q^\beta$, and $r^\gamma$ be three odd prime powers with $p<q<r$ and assume that $N=p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma$ is an odd perfect number. By the same token as above, we see that $$\begin{align*}\sigma(N)=\sigma(p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma) &= \frac{p^{\alpha+1}-1}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q^{\beta+1}-1}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r^{\gamma+1}-1}{r-1} < \frac{p^\alpha p}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q^\beta q}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r^\gamma r}{r-1}\\\implies& \frac{\sigma(N)}{N} = \frac{\sigma(p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma)}{p^\alpha q^\beta r^\gamma} < \frac{p}{p-1} \cdot \frac{q}{q-1} \cdot \frac{r}{r-1}.\end{align*}$$ Suppose that $p=5$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\cdot\frac{11}{10}=\frac{77}{48}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $p=3$. Suppose that $q=7$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\cdot\frac{11}{10}=\frac{77}{40}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $q=5$. Suppose that $r=17$. Then $\frac{\sigma(N)}{N}<\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{4}\cdot\frac{17}{16}=\frac{255}{128}<2$, which is impossible. Hence $r \le 13$. In consequence, we have three possible cases to consider: $r=7$, $r=11$, and $r=13$. In the first case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 7^\gamma$. By the factor chain method, $3^1||N$ implies $4|2N$ and $7^1||N$ implies $8|2N$, neither of which is possible. Hence $\alpha\ge2$ and $\gamma\ge2$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} \ge \frac{\sigma(3^2\cdot5\cdot7^2)}{3^2\cdot5\cdot7^2} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{7^2}\right)=\frac{494}{245}>2,$$ which is impossible, but we already knew that $105=3\cdot5\cdot7$ cannot divide an odd perfect number. In the second case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 11^\gamma$. Suppose that $\beta=1$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} = \frac{\sigma(3^\alpha\cdot5\cdot11^\gamma)}{3^\alpha\cdot5\cdot11^\gamma} < \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{11}{10} = \frac{99}{50} < 2,$$ which is impossible ( could we know that beforehand? ). Hence $\beta\ge2$. By the factor chain method, $\alpha\ge4$ and $\gamma\ge4$. It follows that $$\frac{\sigma(N)}{N} \ge \frac{\sigma(3^4\cdot5^2\cdot11^4)}{3^4\cdot5^2\cdot11^4} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{3^4}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{5^2}\right)\left(1 + \frac{1}{11} + \frac{1}{11^2} + \frac{1}{11^3} + \frac{1}{11^4}\right)=\frac{99851}{49005}>2,$$ which is impossible, but we already knew that $825=3\cdot5^2\cdot11$ cannot divide an odd perfect number. In the third case, we have $N=3^\alpha 5^\beta 13^\gamma$. $\beta=1$ implies deficiency, so $\beta\ge2$. Now, $\alpha=2$ also implies deficiency, so $\alpha\ge4$. By the factor chain method, we must have $\gamma\ge2$, which this time implies abundance. Hence the assumption leads to a contradiction; furthermore, $8775=3^3\cdot5^2\cdot13$ cannot divide an odd perfect number. We are finally done. Unfortunately, proving that $\omega(N)\neq4$ is not this easy by hand. We can similarly show that $p=3$, but then we already have two possible choices for $q$.

For simplicity, restrict to $m$ relatively prime to $n$. For example, if $n=13$ and we want 1 step, then $m=6$ works: $13=2\cdot6+1$. And for 3 steps $m=7$ works: $13=1\cdot7+5$, $7=1\cdot5+2$, and $5=2\cdot2+1$. Since the algorithm is used to find the modular inverse $m^{-1}$ (mod $n$) the fewer steps it takes the easier it is to find (so in particular few step runs are convenient for making homework problems ☺). Note that it is easy to find pairs for a given length of the algorithm. Since the continued fraction of $n/m=[q_0;q_1,\dots,q_k]$ records the quotients one can take an arbitrary continued fraction of given length, and find $n,m$ by contracting it. Hence an alternative way to ask the question is if there is an efficient way to “parametrize” all continued fractions with a given numerator. If the general question is too hard, what can be said for $n$ prime, and/or small lengths like 2,3,4? It is easy for 1, since $n=q\cdot m+1$ the requisite $m$ are just the divisors of $n-1$.
