1,Show that $f$ is an order isomorphism from $\mathbb{N}$ to $I_{\omega}$,Show that  is an order isomorphism from  to,f \mathbb{N} I_{\omega},"Am reading Folland's Real Analysis book, and on page 10 he introduces the set $\Omega$ of countable ordinals. This set is the unique (up to order isomorphism) uncountable well ordered set such that each initial segment $I_x$ of $\Omega$ is countable (proposition 0.18). This set has the property that every countable subset of $\Omega$ has an upper bound (proposition 0.19). Folland writes : The set $\mathbb{N}$ can be identified with a subset of $\Omega$ as follows. Set $f(1)=\min\Omega$ , and proceeding inductively set $f(n)=\min \big(\Omega\setminus\{f(1),\dots,f(n-1)\}\big )$ . The reader may verify that $f$ is an order isomorphism from $\mathbb{N}$ to $I_{\omega}$ , where $\omega$ is the smallest element of $\Omega$ such that $I_\omega$ is infinite. Is this proof correct? First we need to show the existence of $\omega$ by showing that the set $\{x\in\Omega: I_x \text{ is infinite}\}$ is nonempty. Since $\Omega$ is uncountable there exist a countably infinite subset $A\subset\Omega$ , and by proposition 0.19 $A$ has an upper bound $\alpha$ in $\Omega$ . Then $A\subset I_{\alpha}\cup\{\alpha\}$ and since $A$ is infinite so is $I_{\alpha}$ . Second we show that $f:\mathbb{N}\to I_{\omega}$ is an order isomorphism. From the definition of $f$ we have $f(n)<f(n+1)$ and $I_{f(n)}=\{f(1),\dots,f(n-1)\}$ for each $n$ , and so the range of $f$ is indeed a subset of $I_{\omega}$ . To show that $f$ is surjective, let $x\in I_\omega$ . If $I_x=\emptyset$ then $x=f(1)=\min \Omega$ . Otherwise let $x_1<x_2<\dots<x_m$ denote the elements of $I_x$ ( $m\geq1$ ). It is clear that $x_1=f(1)=\min \Omega$ . Assuming $x_k=f(k)$ for all $k=1,\dots,n<m$ , it follows that $x_{n+1}$ is the smallest element of $\Omega\setminus\{f(1),\dots,f(n)\}$ , that is $x_{n+1}=f(n+1)$ . By strong induction it follows that $x_k=f(k)$ for all $k=1,\dots, m$ , which in turn implies $x=f(m+1)$ . This shows that $f$ is surjective. Finally an induction on $n-m$ shows that $n<m$ implies $f(n)<f(m)$ , and so $f$ is order preserving and injective. Altogether we get that $f$ is an order isomorphism. Any feedback is very appreciated.","Am reading Folland's Real Analysis book, and on page 10 he introduces the set of countable ordinals.

(Tao' Analysis I),\in,"Note: This question is not a duplicate of this , due to the corrected version of the book. I'm self-studying Tao's Analysis I . In the corrected third edition, Tao promotes the what was earlier a definition of equality of sets, to the status of an axiom, after someone pointed out an issue with that. Axiom 3.2 (Equality of sets) Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal, iff every element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa. To put it another way $A=B$ if and only if every element $x$ of $A$ belongs also to $B$ and every element $y$ of $B$ belongs also to $A$ . Just after this (well, there's Example 3.1.4 in between), he mentions the following, without justification. The ""is an element of"" relation $\in$ obeys the axiom of substitution (see section A.7). I quote the relevant part of section A.7 here: (Substitution axiom). Given any two objects $x$ and $y$ of the same type, if $x=y$ , then $f(x) = f(y)$ for all functions or operations $f$ . Similarly, for any property $P(x)$ depending on $x$ if $x=y$ , then $P(x)$ and $P(y)$ are equivalent statements. Questions: Why does Axiom 3.2 ensure that $\in$ satisfies the axiom of substitution? This is what I have in mind: To prove that $\in$ satisfies axiom of substitution, one needs to first define an equality relation and $\in$ -relation for sets. Then only we can proceed in any way, as far as I can see. But Axiom 3.2 does not define any of these relations. It just gives a condition that equality and $\in$ must satisfy. Don't we need another axiom stating that there is an equality relation on sets, and a relation $\in$ on sets such that $\in$ obeys axiom of substitution with respect to this equality?","Note: This question is not a duplicate of this , due to the corrected version of the book.

Informally, if we allow $R = \{ x \mid x \not \in x \}$ to be understood as a process of building $R$ (or an algorithm in some sense), every set could be matched against the criterion sequentially, one at a time.

Nielson, and Chris Hankin . Chapter 1.3 Data Flow Analysis says the following: The least solution. The above system of equations defines the twelve sets $$\text{RD}_\text{entry}(1), \dots, \text{RD}_{\text{exit}}(6)$$ in terms of each other. Writing $\overrightarrow{RD}$ for this twelve-tuple of sets we can regard the equation system as defining a function $F$ and demanding that: $$\overrightarrow{RD} = F(\overrightarrow{RD})$$ To be more specific we can write $$F(\overrightarrow{RD}) (F_\text{entry}(1)(\overrightarrow{RD}), F_\text{exit}(1)(\overrightarrow{RD}), \dots, F_\text{entry}(6)(\overrightarrow{RD}), F_\text{exit}(6)(\overrightarrow{RD}))$$ where e.g.: $$F_\text{entry}(3)(\dots, \overrightarrow{RD}_\text{exit}(2), \dots, \overrightarrow{RD}_\text{exit}(5), \dots) = \overrightarrow{RD}_\text{exit}(2) \cup \overrightarrow{RD}_\text{exit}(5)$$ It should be clear that $F$ operates over twelve-tuples of sets of pairs of variables and labels; this can be written as $F : (\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star \times \mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star}))}^{12} \to (\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star \times \mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star}))}^{12}$ where it might be natural to take $\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star} = \mathbf{\text{Var}}$ and $\mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star} = \mathbf{\text{Lab}}$ . However, it will simplify the presentation in this chapter to let $\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star}$ be a finite subset of $\mathbf{\text{Var}}$ that contains the variables occurring in the program $\mathbf{S_\star}$ of interest and similarly for $\mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star}$ . So for the example program we might have $\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star} = \{ x, y, z \}$ and $\mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star} = \{ 1, \dots, 6, ? \}$ . It is immediate that $(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star \times \mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star}))}^{12}$ can be partially ordered by setting $$\overrightarrow{\text{RD}} \sqsubseteq \overrightarrow{\text{RD}}^\prime \ \ \ \text{iff} \ \ \ \forall i : \text{RD}_i \subseteq \text{RD}_i^\prime$$ where $\overrightarrow{\text{RD}} = (\text{RD}_1, \dots, \text{RD}_{12})$ and similarly $\overrightarrow{\text{RD}}^\prime = (\text{RD}_1^\prime, \dots, \text{RD}_{12}^\prime)$ . This turns $(\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{\text{Var}_\star \times \mathbf{\text{Lab}_\star}))}^{12}$ into a complete lattice (see Appendix A) with least element $$\overrightarrow{\emptyset} = (\emptyset, \dots, \emptyset)$$ and binary least upper bounds given by: $$\overrightarrow{\text{RD}} \sqcup \overrightarrow{\text{RD}}^\prime = (\text{RD}_1 \cup \text{RD}_1^\prime, \dots, \text{RD}_{12} \cup \text{RD}_{12}^\prime)$$ It is easy to show that $F$ is in fact a monotone function (see Appendix A) meaning that: $$\overrightarrow{\text{RD}} \sqsubseteq \overrightarrow{\text{RD}}^\prime \ \ \ \text{implies} \ \ \ F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}}) \sqsubseteq F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}})^\prime$$ This involves calculations like $$\text{RD}_\text{exit}(2) \subseteq \text{RD}_\text{exit}^\prime(2) \ \ \text{and} \ \ \text{RD}_\text{exit}(5) \subseteq \text{RD}_\text{exit}^\prime(5)$$ imply $$\text{RD}_\text{exit}(2) \cup \text{RD}_\text{exit}(5) \subseteq \text{RD}^\prime_\text{exit}(2) \cup \text{RD}_\text{exit}^\prime(5)$$ and the details are left to the reader. Appendix A gives the following definition for monotone function : The function $f$ is monotone (or isotone or order-preserving ) if $$\forall l, l^\prime \in L_1 : l \sqsubseteq_1 l^\prime \Rightarrow f(l) \sqsubseteq_2 f(l^\prime)$$ I am trying to do as the author said, and show that $F$ is a monotone function. However, although I have tried to solve this in various ways (see here ), I have so far been unable to make progress. It seems to me that such a proof should proceed by showing that, for some arbitrary element of the set of elements $F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}})$ , if we use the fact that $\overrightarrow{\text{RD}} \sqsubseteq \overrightarrow{\text{RD}}^\prime$ , then we can deduce that said arbitrary element is also an element of the set $F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}})^\prime$ , and so $F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}}) \sqsubseteq F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}})^\prime$ . However, it seems to me that the textbook is very poorly written, and so it is difficult for me to even understand what said arbitrary elements of the set $F(\overrightarrow{\text{RD}})^\prime$ even are (they seem to be some kind of cartesian product, but I get very confused when trying to figure out precisely what they are).

49,Generalizing the summation process for infinite sets,Generalizing the summation process for infinite sets,,"Today I found myself wondering about the sum of all integers $\mathbb Z$ . We know that $\mathbb Z$ is a countable set, This means that we can list all the elements of $\mathbb Z$ , thus we can solve the problem using sums: $$\sum_{z\in \mathbb Z}z=\sum_{z=1}^\infty z + (-z) = 0$$ So we have that the sum of all integers is 0. By the same argument we have that the sums of all rational numbers $\mathbb Q$ is also 0. My first question is: Is this argument valid and correct? Then I wonder: Then what is the sum of all real numbers $\mathbb R$ ? Contrarily to $\Bbb Z$ and $\Bbb Q$ , the set $\Bbb R$ is not countable. This means that it is impossible to list the numbers of $\Bbb R$ and thus impossible to sum all numbers using a sum. The first thing that came to my mind was integrals. I sometimes tend to think of integrals like the continuous version of summation. So we can express the sum of all real numbers as: $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty x \ dx = 0$$ This allows us to sum all elements of uncountable sets. For example the of all elements of $(0,1)$ , using this method would be: $$\int\limits_{x\in (0,1)} x \ dx = \int_0^1 x \  dx = \frac{1}{2}$$ My second question is: Is this generalization correct?

The question is stated as: A Proof about the Iteration Theorem. Consider a set $W$ , an element $c$ , and a singulary operation $g$ on $W$ . Let $(P,S,1)$ be a Peano system. We must show that there is a unique function $F:P\rightarrow W$ such that $F(1)=c$ and $F(S(x)=g(F(x))$ for all $x$ in $P$ . Let $K = \{ H:H \subseteq P\times W \land (1,c) \in H \land (\forall x)(\forall w)((x,w) \in H \Rightarrow (S(x), g(w)) \in H\}$ . Observe that $P \times W \in K$ .

By mathematical induction prove B=P.) c. $F(1) = c$ . d. $F(S(x)) = g(F(x))$ for all $x$ in $P$ . My atempt: a) By definition of $F$ we have that $(\forall x)(\forall y)((x,y) \in F \Rightarrow (\forall H)(H \in K \Rightarrow (x,y) \in H))$ , Thus $(\forall H)(H \in K \Rightarrow F \subseteq H)$ and as $(\forall H)(H \in K \Rightarrow H \subseteq P \times W)$ we have also $F \subseteq P \times W$ As for all $H$ in $K$ we have $(1,c) \in H$ , then $ (1,c) \in \bigcap_{H \in K}H$ and therefore $(1,c) \in F$ . Let $(x,y)$ be some arbitrary element of $F$ , the by defintition it belongs to every $H$ in $K$ , thus by definition of $K$ , $(S(x), g(y))$ belong to every $H$ in $K$ and therefore belongs to $F$ also, as $(x,y)$ is arbitrary we got $(\forall x)(\forall y)((x,y) \in F \Rightarrow (S(x), g(y)) \in F)$ . Thus we have that $F$ met all conditions to belong to $K$ and therefore $F \in K$ . b) (Using the set $B$ defined in the hint above) First let some $N \in K$ where $(\forall y)((1,y) \in N \Rightarrow y=c)$ , from this we have that $(\forall y)((1,y) \in \bigcap_{H \in K}H) \Rightarrow y=c$ , thus by definition of $F$ we have that $(\exists !w)(w \in W \land (1,w) \in F)$ , namely $w=c$ , therefore $1 \in B$ .

Let some $M$ in $K$ be defined with the following restriction $(\forall y)((S(x),y) \in M \Rightarrow y = g(w))$ , thus $(\forall y)((S(x),y) \in \bigcap_{H \in K}H \Rightarrow y=g(w))$ , from this and by definition of $F$ we have that $(\exists !u)(u \in W \land (S(x), u) \in F)$ , namely $u=g(w)$ , therefore we have shown that $x \in B \Rightarrow S(x) \in B$ , thus by Mathematical induction $B=P$ . c) We have $(1,y) \in F$ , then $(1,y)$ belong to every $H$ in $K$ . Let some $O$ in $K$ where $(\forall y)((1,y) \in O \Rightarrow y=c)$ , then $(\forall y)((1,y) \in \bigcap_{H \in K}H \Rightarrow y=c)$ , thus by definition of $F$ we have that $F(1) = c$ . d) Let $A = \{x : x \in P \land F(S(x)) = g(F(x))\}$ .

Now assume $x \in A$ , thus $x \in P \land F(S(x)) = g(F(x))$ , as $(S(x), g(F(x)) \in F$ , then $(S(x), g(F(x))$ belong to every $H$ in $K$ , therefore (S(S(x)), g(g(F(x)))) belong to every $H$ in $K$ thus we got that $F(S(S(x))) = (g(F(S(x)))$ , thus $S(x) \in A$ .

From the assumption above, it follows that there exists a bijection $ f:\mathbb{N}^{<n}\to A $ . We'll define $ g:\mathcal{P}\left(A\right)\to\left\{ 0,1\right\} ^{\mathbb{N}^{<n}} $ by: For any $ B\in\mathcal{P}\left(A\right) $ $ g\left(B\right)\left(m\right)=\begin{cases} 0 & f\left(m\right)\notin B\\ 1 & f\left(m\right)\in B \end{cases} $ I'm sure we all agree that $ g $ is a bijection.

Bloch’s Proofs and Fundamentals . Problem: Let $f,g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be real functions of a real variable given by $$f(x) = \begin{cases} 1-2x, & \text{if} & 0 \leq x \\ |x|, & \text{if} & x < 0 \end{cases}, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{and}$$ $$g(x) = \begin{cases} 3x, & \text{if} & 0 \leq x \\ x-1, & \text{if} & x < 0 \end{cases}, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.$$ Find $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ . Solution: We start with $f \circ g$ . First, we observe that $0 \leq g(x)$ , for all $x \in [0, \infty)$ . So, $(f \circ g) (x) = 1-6x$ , for all $x \in [0,\infty)$ . Next, we observe that $g(x) < 0$ for all $x \in (-\infty,0)$ . Hence, $(f \circ g)(x) = |x-1|$ , for all $x \in (-\infty,0)$ . Then, we compute $g \circ f$ . Following the same argument, we see that $0 \leq f(x)$ , for all $x \in (-\infty,\frac{1}{2}]$ . So, we have that $(g \circ f)(x) = 3-6x$ , for all $x \in (-\infty,\frac{1}{2}]$ . Next, we observe that $f(x) < 0$ , for all $x \in (\frac{1}{2},\infty)$ . Hence, we have that $(g \circ f)(x)=|x|-1$ , for all $x \in (\frac{1}{2},\infty)$ . Therefore, we have that $f \circ g, g \circ f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are defined by $$ (f \circ g)(x) = \begin{cases} 1-6x, & \text{if} & 0 \leq x \\ |x-1|, & \text{if} & x<0\end{cases}, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \text{and} $$ $$ (g \circ f)(x) = \begin{cases} 3-6x, & \text{if} & x \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ |x|-1, & \text{if} & \frac{1}{2} < x \end{cases}, \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}. $$ My question: Is this enough and correct?

I'm trying to prove this basic fact of cardinal arithmetic, but I'm getting stuck on the uncountable sets. I suspect there's an obvious technique that I'm missing for proving statements like this. I'm okay with taking the axiom of choice and am not trying to prove that this fact is equivalent to the axiom of choice as in this question . Let $\varepsilon$ refer to the empty set. Let $\mathbb{N}$ refer to the positive integers. I'm trying to prove that $$ \text{$\left|A\right| = \left|A \times A\right|$ if and only if $\left|A\right| \in \{0, 1\}$ or $A$ is infinite.} $$ Here's my attempt to prove it. Let's consider five different mutually exclusive cases for the size of $A$ . $A$ is empty $A$ is a singleton $\left|A\right| \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge2}$ $A$ is countably infinite. $A$ is uncountably infinite. case 1/5: $A$ is empty. $ \varepsilon \times \varepsilon $ is equal to $\varepsilon$ . case 2/5: $A$ is a singleton. $ \{\sigma_1\} \times \{\sigma_2\} $ is $\{(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\}$ . case 3/5: $\left|A\right| \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge2}$ Let $x$ be a real variable. $$ \text{If $x = xx$, then $x \in \{0, 1\}$  } $$ Therefore, the left and right components of the theorem are both never true. case 4/5: $A$ is countably infinite. Since $A$ is countably infinite, there exists a bijective function $f : A \to \mathbb{N}$ . There's a bijective function $g$ from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ , Arguments to $g$ are shown below with a leading dot, for example ·7 . * marks a value that has been omitted for expository purposes. x          ·1  ·2  ·3  ·4      ·1   1   3   6  10   y  ·2   2   5   9   *      ·3   4   8   *   *      ·4   7   *   *   * We notice that the first row is the triangle numbers, so $g(x, 1) = \frac{x+xx}{2}$ . For the cells below the first row, we note that $g(x, y) = g(y+x-1, 1) + (1 - y)$ . $g$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ . Thus $h$ , as defined below, is a bijection from $A \times A$ to $A$ . $$ h(a, b) = f^{(-1)}(g(f(a), f(b))) $$ case 5/5: $A$ is uncountably infinite. This case, I can't prove, but I can prove it for some of the uncountable cardinalities. Let $\varphi$ be a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \}$ . Let $a$ be a bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $[0,1]$ . $$ a(t) = \frac{\arctan(t) + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi} $$ $$ a(-\infty) = 0 $$ $$ a(+\infty) = 1 $$ Let $j$ be a bijection from $[0,1] \times [0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ . Let $j(x, y)$ be given as follows. Write out $x$ and $y$ in base 2. Using the following table, convert each digit pair one at a time in $x$ and $y$ to base 4. x        ·0  ·1  y  ·0  0   1     ·1  2   3 for example $$ j(.01\cdots, .11\cdots) = .23\cdots $$ We can use this to define a bijection from $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ . $$ \psi(u, v) = \varphi^{(-1)} \circ a^{(-1)} \circ j(a\circ \varphi(u), a \circ \varphi(v)) $$ Let $S_X$ be the set of functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ , then we can define a bijection $p$ from $S_X \times S_X$ to $S_X$ as follows. Let $\lambda \cdots \mathop. \cdots$ denote an anonymous function. $$ p(a, b) = \lambda x \mathop. \psi(a(x), b(x)) $$ The same arguments works for the set $D$ , where $x \in D$ if $x$ is positive or negative infinity or if $\arctan(x)$ is a dyadic rational. In the case of dyadic rationals, after a prefix of finite length all the digits are zero in both base 2 and base 4. Therefore $D$ is countable. Therefore, we have bijections between $A$ and $A \times A$ for all cardinalities of the form $\left|\mathbb{R}\right|$ , $\left|X \to \mathbb{R}\right|$ , and $\left|X \to D\right|$ . However, I don't have any reason to believe that all of the uncountable cardinalities are expressible in this way.","How do you prove that is equal to for every infinite set?

There's a bijective function from to , Arguments to are shown below with a leading dot, for example ·7 . * marks a value that has been omitted for expository purposes. x          ·1  ·2  ·3  ·4      ·1   1   3   6  10   y  ·2   2   5   9   *      ·3   4   8   *   *      ·4   7   *   *   * We notice that the first row is the triangle numbers, so . For the cells below the first row, we note that . is a bijection from to . Thus , as defined below, is a bijection from to . case 5/5: is uncountably infinite. This case, I can't prove, but I can prove it for some of the uncountable cardinalities. Let be a bijection from to . Let be a bijection from to . Let be a bijection from to . Let be given as follows. Write out and in base 2. Using the following table, convert each digit pair one at a time in and to base 4. x        ·0  ·1  y  ·0  0   1     ·1  2   3 for example We can use this to define a bijection from to . Let be the set of functions from to , then we can define a bijection from to as follows. Let denote an anonymous function. The same arguments works for the set , where if is positive or negative infinity or if is a dyadic rational. In the case of dyadic rationals, after a prefix of finite length all the digits are zero in both base 2 and base 4. Therefore is countable. Therefore, we have bijections between and for all cardinalities of the form , , and . However, I don't have any reason to believe that all of the uncountable cardinalities are expressible in this way.","\left|A \times A\right| \left|A\right| \varepsilon \mathbb{N}  \text{\left|A\right| = \left|A \times A\right| if and only if \left|A\right| \in \{0, 1\} or A is infinite.}  A A A \left|A\right| \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge2} A A A  \varepsilon \times \varepsilon  \varepsilon A  \{\sigma_1\} \times \{\sigma_2\}  \{(\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\} \left|A\right| \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge2} x  \text{If x = xx, then x \in \{0, 1\}  }  A A f : A \to \mathbb{N} g \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \mathbb{N} g g(x, 1) = \frac{x+xx}{2} g(x, y) = g(y+x-1, 1) + (1 - y) g \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \mathbb{N} h A \times A A  h(a, b) = f^{(-1)}(g(f(a), f(b)))  A \varphi \mathbb{R} \mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, \infty \} a \mathbb{R} [0,1]  a(t) = \frac{\arctan(t) + \frac{\pi}{2}}{\pi}   a(-\infty) = 0   a(+\infty) = 1  j [0,1] \times [0,1] [0,1] j(x, y) x y x y  j(.01\cdots, .11\cdots) = .23\cdots  \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \mathbb{R}  \psi(u, v) = \varphi^{(-1)} \circ a^{(-1)} \circ j(a\circ \varphi(u), a \circ \varphi(v))  S_X X \mathbb{R} p S_X \times S_X S_X \lambda \cdots \mathop. \cdots  p(a, b) = \lambda x \mathop. \psi(a(x), b(x))  D x \in D x \arctan(x) D A A \times A \left|\mathbb{R}\right| \left|X \to \mathbb{R}\right| \left|X \to D\right|","['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"
66,Proof that $ \mathbb{R} $ is uncountable,Proof that  is uncountable, \mathbb{R} ,"Im sure this question has been asked here a lot, but I'd like to hear if the way I understood Cantor's diagonal proof is correct. We know that $ \left(0,1\right)\sim\mathbb{R} $ . So its enough to prove that $ (0,1) $ is uncountable. Now, assume by contradiction that $ (0,1) $ is countable.

Unfortunately the book contains no answers and the only solution manual for the book I found thought it was too trivial to include its solution. For problem 5.10 (d) I would like some sort of clue, since the hint given in the book is, I think, a typo. Let $A$ be a non empty set and $\operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ be the set of all partitions of $A$ . Define a relation $\preceq$ in $\operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ by: $S_1 \preceq S_2$ if and only if for every $C \in S_1$ there is $D \in S_2$ such that $C \subseteq D$ . Take $T \subseteq \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ . Prove $\inf{T}$ exists. The idea is to find the greatest partition $S$ of $A$ such that, $S \preceq Q,$ for every $Q \in T$ . Since $A \neq \emptyset$ , take $x \in A$ and consider the set $P_x = \{ z \in A: \forall Q \in T, \exists E \in Q, (x,z \in E) \}$ . Define $S = \{P_x: x \in A \}$ . I want to prove $S = \inf T$ . First we show $S$ is indeed a partition of $A$ : $S$ contains non empty sets: This is easy, since for any $x \in A$ , $x \in P_x$ (Remember, for every $Q \in T, A = \bigcup Q$ ). $S$ is a collection of disjoint sets: Take $P_x, P_y \in S$ and $z \in P_x \cap Py$ . Then for every $Q \in T$ , there is some $E \in Q$ and some $F \in Q$ such that $x,z \in E$ and $y, z \in F$ . Since $E$ and $F$ belong to the partition $Q$ and $z \in E \cap F$ , we must have $E = F$ . This implies $P_x = P_y.$ $A = \bigcup S$ : $x \in A \Longleftrightarrow$ for every $Q \in T, x \in \bigcup Q \Longleftrightarrow$ for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $x \in Q \Longleftrightarrow x \in P_x,$ for $x \in A$ $\Longleftrightarrow x \in \bigcup S$ . So $S \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ , as desired. We now proceed to prove $S$ is indeed the infimum of $T$ : $S$ is a lower bound of $T$ : We want to show that $S \preceq R$ , for every $R \in T$ . So let $R$ be any partition in $T$ . If $P_x \in S,$ for $x \in A$ , let $F$ be the set in $R$ that contains $x$ (there is one and only one such set); we show $P_x \subseteq F$ . If $z \in P_x$ , then for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $x,z \in E$ . In particular, for partition $R$ we have $x,z \in F$ . Then $P_x \subseteq F$ and we conclude $S \preceq R$ , as wanted. $S = \inf{T}$ : Let $S_0 \in \operatorname{Pt}{A}$ such that $S_0 \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . We prove $S_0 \preceq S$ , so let us take $F \in S_0$ and $x \in F$ (the set $F$ is not empty). Then, for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $F \subseteq E$ ; so every element in $F$ (in particular $x$ ) is contained in all those sets $E$ , hence $F \subseteq P_x$ , with $P_x \in S$ . We conclude $S_0 \preceq S$ . We conclude $\inf{T} = S$ . Prove $\sup{T}$ exists. For this the book suggests forming $T_0 = \{ R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}: \forall Q \in T, Q \preceq R \}$ , and then showing $\sup{T_0} = \inf{T}$ ; however I think this is a typo, and the authors meant $\sup{T} = \inf{T_0}$ . For this part, actually, I am a bit lost. I tried writing the definitions, but couldn't even show $\inf{T}$ is an upper bound for $T$ . In problem 5.10 (c) I would like any feedback, especially from the very last part ( $S = \inf{T}$ ), as it feels a bit sketchy for me. Thank you for the help. Update: Thank you for the answer. I will fill in the details in your argument, if only for the sake of future reference: Prove $\inf{T}$ exists. Let us start by recalling that there is an asossiated equivalence relation $\sim_Q$ in $A$ for every $Q \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ : $x \sim_Q y \Longleftrightarrow$ there is some $C \in Q$ such that $x, y \in C$ . Let $Q, R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ . Then, $Q \preceq R \Longleftrightarrow \sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ : First the ( $\Longrightarrow$ ) direction: Assume $Q \preceq R$ . If $x \sim_Q y$ , then there is some $C \in Q$ such that $x,y \in C.$ But this implies the existence of some $D \in R$ such that $C \subseteq D$ (definition of $\preceq$ ). Hence $x, y$ both belong to some set in $R$ (namely $D$ ), so $x \sim_R y$ . We concluce $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ . Now the ( $\Longleftarrow$ ) direction: Assume $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ . If $C \in Q$ , then $C \neq \emptyset$ , so we take some $x \in C$ . The relation $\sim_Q$ is reflexive so $x \sim_Q x$ , which implies $x \sim_R x$ . This is, $x$ belongs to some $D \in R$ . Notice this set $D$ is unique, for if $y \in C$ and $x \neq y$ , then $x \sim_Q y$ ; this again implies $x \sim_R y$ , which means $x$ and $y$ belong to the same set in $R$ . But $R$ is a partition, so $x$ can belong to only one set in this partition, the set $D$ . Thus, $C \subseteq D$ and $Q \preceq R$ . Now we define $\sim = \bigcap \{\sim_Q: Q \in T\}$ , which is an equivalence relation in $A$ (we leave this easy verification for the reader). This relation induces a partition of $A$ , $A/\sim = \{[x]_\sim: x \in A\}$ , which will be denoted by $S$ for simpliticy. We show $\inf{T} = S$ : $S$ is a lower bound of $T$ : We know $\sim \subseteq \sim_Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Then, $S \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . $\inf{T} = S$ : Let $S_0 \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ be such that $S_0 \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Then $\sim_{S_0} \subseteq \sim_Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Hence, $\sim_{S_0} \subseteq \sim$ , which implies $S_0 \preceq S$ as desired. We conclude $\inf{T} = S$ . Prove $\sup{T}$ exists. Let $T_0 = \{ R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}: \forall Q \in T, Q \preceq R \}$ . By the previous exercise, $\inf{T_0} = F$ exists and its induced equivalence relation is: $\sim_F = \bigcap\{\sim_R: R \in T_0\}$ . We show $\sup{T} = F$ . $F$ is an uper bound of $T$ : Take $Q \in T$ . Then we have $Q \preceq R$ , for every $R \in T_0$ , which implies $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ , for every $R \in T_0$ . Hence $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_F$ , and thus $Q \preceq F$ . So $F$ is an upper bound of $T$ . $\sup{T} = F$ : The partition $\inf{T_0} = F$ is an upper bound for $T$ , but $T_0$ is the set of upper bounds for $T$ and, then, it is the least upper bound for $T$ . We conclude $\sup{T} = F$ .","I am self-studying Hrbacek and Jech's Introduction to Set Theory (3rd edition), and I want to know if the following solution to problem 5.10 (c) is correct.

Let be $(X,\le)$ a totally ordered set and we prove by induction that any not empty finite subset $A$ of $X$ has a minimum element. Since $X$ is a totally ordered set, previously we observe that any its subset $Y$ (finite or infinite) is a chain. Obviously any subset $A$ of one element $a$ has trivially a minimum. So we suppose that any subset of $n$ elements has a minimum element and then  we consider a subset $A$ of $n+1$ elements: since $A$ is finite there exists a bijection $\phi$ from $A$ onto some natural number $m$ , that is the successor of $n$ , and so we can organize the elements of $A$ in a finite succession, that is $A=\{a_1,...,a_{n+1}\}$ . Now we consider the subset $B=\{a_h\in A:h\le n\}$ : obviously $X$ is a subset of $A$ that has $n$ element and so it has a minimum element $b$ ; so since $A=B\cup\{a_{n+1}\}$ and since $A$ is a chain (remember what before we observed), it must be or $a_{n+1}\le b$ or $b<a_{n+1}$ and so for the transitivity property of the order relation $\le$ in any case $A$ has a minimum element.

My attempt goes as follows: Any total order $\leq$ has the following properties: $\forall _{z_1\in \mathbb{C}}(z_1\leq z_1)$ (reflexive) $\forall _{z_1,z_2\in \mathbb{C}}\left(z_1\leq z_2\land z_2\leq z_1\Rightarrow z_1=z_2\right)$ (anti-symmetric) $\forall_{z_1,z_2,z_3\in \mathbb{C}}\left(z_1\leq z_2\land z_2\leq z_3\Rightarrow z_1\leq z_3\right)$ (transitive) $\forall _{z_1,z_2\in \mathbb{C}}\left(z_1\leq \ z_2\lor z_2\leq z_1\right)$ (total order) The question proposes a further algebraic property: $\forall _{z_1,z_2\in \mathbb{C}}\left(0\leq z_1\land \ 0\leq z_2\Rightarrow 0\leq z_1+z_2\land 0\leq z_1 z_2\right)$ We need to prove that there is no relation with all five properties. The partial order $z_1\leq z_2\Leftrightarrow\left(z_1=z_2\lor\left|z_1\right|<\left| z_2\right|\right)$ has properties 1, 2, 3 and 5.

Using $z_1=2i$ and $z_2=-1$ in property 5 gives $0\leq -1+2i$ and $0\leq -2i$ Alternatively, using $z_1=z_2=-1$ in property 5 gives $0\leq -2$ and $0\leq 1$ In general, we generate $0\leq a+bi$ for various integer $a$ and $b$ . If $i\leq 0$ , then property 5 gives no results. Regardless of the initial $0\leq z$ , property 5 only gives $0\leq P(z)$ , where $P(z)$ are integer coefficient polynomials in $z$ . How does this provide a contradiction? Furthermore, the $z\leq 0$ case seems entirely intractable. An attempt at $5\Rightarrow\neg 4$ : Any violation of 4 requires $\neg 0\leq z\land \neg z\leq 0$ The contrapositive of 5 only generates $\neg 0\leq P(z)$ starting with $\neg 0\leq z$ and hence does not violate 4.

Assume the real number set $\mathbb{R}$ is countable, then we can list all of the numbers like this $$\mathbb{R}=\{x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n,\cdots\}.$$ First, take a closed interval $[a_1,b_1]$ such that $x_1 \notin [a_1,b_1]$ , which is always possible. Now, divide $[a_1,b_1]$ into three equal parts, namely $\left[a_1,\frac{2a_1+b_1}{3}\right],\left[\frac{2a_1+b_1}{3},\frac{a_1+2b_1}{3}\right]$ and $\left[\frac{a_1+2b_1}{3},b_1\right],$ there exists at least one of which not containing $x_2$ .
