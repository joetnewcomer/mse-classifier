Since the open intervals we construct around the rationals inside of $E$ might overlap, I'm having trouble seeing how to control the size of the final closed set. Any hints as to what I'm missing?

The area under the second triangle $A_2$ is equal to $1/4$ . We repeat this process indefinitely for triangles of height $1$ . The resulting function is continuous, non-negative and therefore integrable.
