I am guessing that $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ $\neq$ $\nabla |\vec{u}|^n$ $\times$ $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$, as to even speak about $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$, i.e. the gradient of a vector we would have to talk about either the cross product or dot product of the gradient and $\nabla (\vec{a} \times \vec{r})$ By the way, I am told the answer given is $\nabla |\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^n$ = $n|\vec{a} \times \vec{r}|^{n-2} \Big(\vec{a} \times (\vec{r} \times \vec{a})\Big)$.

Given that $A$ is the line segment from which she walked, determine the value of the following integral(Hint: Use parametric equations.): $$ \int_{A}^{} x^{2}dx + y^{2}dy + xzdz $$ Answer:(Sorry if this seems like more of a discussion than an answer, i'm still learning and it helps when I write down everything going on in my head.) First we parameterise the curve $A$ . First, find the direction vector for the line segment. In order to do this we subtract the two points that we originally have, thus: $(3,2,4)-(0,1,2) = \langle 3,1,2 \rangle$ . Now let us define the parametric function $r(t)$ , in order to parameterise the curve we must multiply by $t$ . Thus: $r(t) = \langle 0,1,2 \rangle + t\langle 3,1,2 \rangle $ , simplifying we eventually get $r(t) = \langle 3t,t + 1,2t + 2 \rangle$ . In order for us to get a definite integral we must find some sort of interval. To do this let us test the points $0,1$ . It follows that: $r(0) = \langle 0,1,2 \rangle$ and that, $r(1) = \langle 3,2,4 \rangle$ . Now we can finally get rid of this Line integral and replace it with a definite one with the interval $[0,1]$ , However first we must calculate a few derivatives. $$A: \begin{cases} x(t)=0+3t,\\y(t)=1+t,\\z(t)+2+2t\end{cases},\quad 0\leqslant t\leqslant 1.$$ Therefore, $x'(t)=3,y'(t)=1,z'(t)=2$ . Now that we have these values we can proceed to evaluate the definite integral: $$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned} \int_{A}^{} x^{2}dx + y^{2}dy + xzdz &= \int_{0}^{1} x^{2}dx + y^{2}dy + xzdz \\  &= \int_{0}^{1} (3t)^{2}(3) + (1 + t)^{2}(1) + (3t)(2t + 2)(2) dt \\   &= \int_{0}^{1} 27t^{2} + t^{2} + 2t + 1 + 12t^{2} + 12t dt \\   &= \int_{0}^{1} 40t^{2} + 1 + 14t dt \end{aligned}\end{equation}$$ Now we can simply evaluate this using the power rule: $$ \int_{0}^{1} \frac{40t^{3}}{3} + t + 7t^{2} dt= \left[\frac{40(1)^{3}}{3} + (1)^{2} + 7(1)^{2}\right] - \left[\frac{40(0)^{3}}{3} + (0)^{2} + 7(0)^{2}\right]=\frac{64}{3}.$$","Question: Sami walked from the point to in a straight line.

For the second integral, I thought one might argue that, even though, for some $x_0\in\Bbb Q\cap(0,1)$ there are only finitely many points $(x_0,y)\in S,$ since $\Bbb Q\cap(0,1)$ is dense in $[0,1],$ if we take a good enough subdivision of $[0,1]\times[0,1],$ letting $m\to\infty,$ there are infinitely many points from $S$ in a rectangle of the subdivision so the lower Darboux sum would equal $0,$ while the upper would be $1$ and therefore, $\displaystyle\int_{[0,1]^2}\chi_S$ wouldn't exist, and neither would the given integral.

It has been said, that the NSE is supercritical (see  T. Tao, Why proving global regularity conjecture for Navier-Stokes is hard (terrytao.wordpress.com, March 18, 2007)), because the rescaling that preserves the equation is $$\vec{u} \rightarrow \frac{1}{k}\vec{u}$$ while the energy is an integral of $|\vec{u}|^2$ and thus the rescaling that preserves the energy is given by $$\vec{u} \rightarrow \frac{1}{k^{3/2}} \vec{u}$$ thereby showing that for the NSE in 3 dimensions energy is being rescaled more severely; this amplifies the rescaling at small scales $k\ll1$ . Hence, the NSE appears to be energy-supercritical. The attempt here is to show that in this reasoning, the assumption is only true in part; becaise the rescaling that preserves the NSE is not $\vec{u} \rightarrow \frac{1}{k}\vec{u}$ , but it is actually $$\vec{u}^\prime = k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}\vec{u},$$ where $$ \begin{split} (x,y,z)^\prime &= k^{\alpha_x}(x,y,z)\\ t^\prime & = k^{\alpha_t}t \end{split} $$ and these are identical with the above rescaling laws only when $\alpha_x=1$ , $\alpha_t=2$ but not in general. This fact was discovered only recently, see A. Ercan and M. L. Kavvas, Chaos 25, 123126 (2015). But this changes everything, because to keep the NSE invariant under scaling transformation, the velocity and energy transform as $$ \begin{split} \vec{u}^\prime & = k^{\alpha_x-\alpha_t}\vec{u} \\ E^\prime & = k^{5\alpha_x-2\alpha_t} E \end{split} $$ and the energy $E$ at a given moment $t$ , would be scale-invariant if $\vec{u}$ transformed according to the law $$\vec{u}^\prime = k^{-\frac{3}{2}\alpha_x}\vec{u}.$$ Then, appllying T. Tao's definitions of critical, subcritical and supercritical (see T. Tao, Current developments in mathematics 2006 , 255(2008))  we find that the NSE is energy-subcritical, when $\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}>\frac{5}{2}$ , energy-critical, when $\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}=\frac{5}{2}$ , energy-supercritical, when $\frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_x}<\frac{5}{2}$ .

This fact was discovered only recently, see A. Ercan and M. L. Kavvas, Chaos 25, 123126 (2015). But this changes everything, because to keep the NSE invariant under scaling transformation, the velocity and energy transform as and the energy at a given moment , would be scale-invariant if transformed according to the law Then, appllying T. Tao's definitions of critical, subcritical and supercritical (see T. Tao, Current developments in mathematics 2006 , 255(2008))  we find that the NSE is energy-subcritical, when , energy-critical, when , energy-supercritical, when . Do you find this reasoning correct/credible? NSE criticality is quite important and relates to the smoothness of solutions Your kind thoughts and suggestions are welcome.

96,Differentiability Implies Continuity (Multivariable Calculus),Differentiability Implies Continuity (Multivariable Calculus),,"I am reading Hubbard and Hubbard's Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms, and in it they provide the following theorem and proof. My issue is not with the theorem, but more so with the proof. Note that, in the theorem below, Equation 1.7.20 refers to the basic definition of the (multivariable) derivative, and $L$ is the linear transformation which defines the derivative. In particular, they seem to implicitly be distributing the limit in order to make the desired conclusion. That is, they seem to be using the theorem below (bullet point 1). But this theorem of course requires the hypothesis that both $f$ and $g$ have the given limit.

My issue is not with the theorem, but more so with the proof. Note that, in the theorem below, Equation 1.7.20 refers to the basic definition of the (multivariable) derivative, and is the linear transformation which defines the derivative. In particular, they seem to implicitly be distributing the limit in order to make the desired conclusion. That is, they seem to be using the theorem below (bullet point 1). But this theorem of course requires the hypothesis that both and have the given limit.

98,'Guessing' local extrema of a polynomial given its roots,'Guessing' local extrema of a polynomial given its roots,,"To start with let's assume that $p$ is a degree $n>1$ polynomial in $x$ and has $n$ distinct roots $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ . Without loss of generality we can also stipulate that $0 = \alpha_1 < \cdots < \alpha_n = 1$ . This guarantees there are $n-1$ local extrema, occurring at locations $x_1 \in (\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$ , $x_2 \in (\alpha_2, \alpha_3)$ , and so on. One might like to guess at the values of $x_i$ based on knowledge of the roots, and I'm curious about any heuristics that could do better than guessing the midpoint of each interval. Of course, if $n$ is small, then there exists an explicit formula; e.g. when $p(x)=(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)$ then $x_1 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)/2$ , the midpoint between the roots. But as early as $n=3$ things get murky; if $p(x)=(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)(x-\alpha_3)$ , then $$x_{1,2}=\frac{\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3}{3}\pm\frac{\sqrt{(\alpha_1+\alpha_2+\alpha_3)^2-3(\alpha_1\alpha_2+\alpha_1\alpha_3+\alpha_2\alpha_3)}}{3}$$ From this we see that the two extrema are centered around the mean of the roots. For example when $\alpha_2=1/2$ , they are at $1/2 \pm \sqrt{3}/6$ , so they're ""pushed out"" toward $0$ and $1$ (as opposed to being evenly distributed at $1/4$ and $3/4$ ). Based on this idea, I can imagine a heuristic that says the extremal values will be nearer some roots and further away from others, where ""nearer"" and ""further"" should be taken in a relative sense; in the simple example above they would be nearer $\alpha_1=0$ and $\alpha_3=1$ , and further from $\alpha_2 = 1/2$ . Once there are more roots, do the roles of the roots alternate? (a ""near"" root, then a ""far root"", then a ""near"" root again?). A more concrete question to ask is: suppose I just guess that the extrema are at the midpoints between each pair of roots, call them $m_1 = (\alpha_1+\alpha_2)/2$ , $m_2=(\alpha_2+\alpha_3)/2$ , and so on. Call the error term $E=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum|m_i - x_i|^2$ . How does $E$ depend on the roots of $p$ ? Is it monotonic with $n$ in some sense? This is an idle curiosity; I'm just trying to dream up interesting Calc I problems and found something that is a little too interesting.","To start with let's assume that is a degree polynomial in and has distinct roots .
