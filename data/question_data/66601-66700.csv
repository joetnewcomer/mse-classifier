8,Arthur Engel Problem Solving Strategies infinite descent proof contradiction Ch-14 Q11,Arthur Engel Problem Solving Strategies infinite descent proof contradiction Ch-14 Q11,,"The question goes as follows: $2n+1$ integral weights are given, where $n \geq 1$ . If we remove any of the weights, the remaining $2n$ weights can be split into two heaps of equal weights. Prove that all weights are equal. I was discussing the book with my teacher and she told me she found a contradiction to the statement. Basically, take $2n$ weights of weight $1$ (say $blue$ weights) and one weight of weight $2n-1$ (say $red$ weight). Here, if we remove one blue weight, then we can split with one red weight one side and the rest $2n-1$ blue weights on the other. If we remove the red weight, then we can split the rest blue weights into two partitions of size $n$ . This partition satisfies the given condition and all the weights are not equal here. So are we wrong here? How so? Because I find it hard to digest Arthur Engel being so wrong because in the solution section, he says this can be extended to rational and irrational weights as well. Also, if we aren't, where is the step in Arthur Engel's proof which overlooks our case? I'll put the original solution here as well, exactly as it is given in PSS: Let $w_1,...,w_{2n+1}$ be the integral weights. Since any $2n$ of the weights balance, the sum of any $2n$ of the weights is even. This implies they are all of the same parity. If they are even, we set $w_i \leftarrow \frac{w_i}{2}$ , and if they are odd, we set $w_i \leftarrow \frac{w_i-1}{2}$ . In each case we get a new set of weights with the same balancing property. Applying this reduction repeatedly, we see that the $w_i$ are congruent mod $2^k$ for all $k$ . This implies that all $w_i$ are equal. Generalize the result to rational weights, which is easy, and to irrational weights, which is much more difficult.","The question goes as follows: integral weights are given, where .

Maybe the best that can be achieved is a recursion that does not involve a summation having an upper index that increases with grid size. The WolframAlpha article considers a similar but not identical diagonal walk on a rectangular grid. This is problem number five from the 2008 Canada National Olympiad: A self-avoiding rook walk on a chessboard (a rectangular grid of unit squares) is a path traced by a sequence of moves parallel to an edge of the board from one unit square to another, such that each begins where the previous move ended and such that no move ever crosses a square that has previously been crossed, i.e., the rook’s path is non-self-intersecting. Let $R(m, n)$ be the number of self-avoiding rook walks on an $m×n$ ($m$ rows, $n$ columns) chessboard which begin at the lower-left corner and end at the upper-left corner. For example, $R(m, 1) = 1$ for all natural numbers $m$; $R(2, 2) = 2$;   $R(3, 2) = 4$; $R(3, 3) = 11$. Find a formula for $R(3, n)$ for each natural number $n$ . So far, I have deduced that: Once the rook moves to the top row, it will need to move left on the next move, and at least as far as the rightmost open square on an ""open"" block of, say $p$ squares $(p\ge2)$, in the second row. This is equivalent to the rook making a forced move to exactly $(3,p)$ then deciding where to move in a $2\times{p}$ rectangle, so is the rotated equivalent of the original problem for $R(p,2)$. (There may be multiple disjoint open blocks in the second row). Once the rook completes a move to the left in the second row, it will then need to move up to row 3, then proceed as per rule 1. Sub-problem 1: finding $R(p,2)$ The path is completely determined by the $(p-1)$ choices of which rows (excluding the last, potentially including the first) on which to move from one side to another. So $R(p,2) = 2^{p-1} \tag{1}$ This is also applicable if the rook starts out one square to the right (and the walk is between diagonally opposite corners). Enumerating possible walks Introduce the following further notation: $W(3,q)$ : a complete walk for the $R(3,q)$ problem, $q < n$ $W(p,2)$ : a complete walk for the $R(p,2)$ problem, $p < n$ $U^i,D^i,L^i,R^i$ : move of $i$ squares in the up,down,left,right direction to be followed by a move in another direction ($i$ may be omitted if equal to $1$) $R^{i+}, \dots$ : move of $i$ squares to the right,$\dots$ that can be followed by a move in $any$ direction (including a continuation in the same direction) I have identified the following distinct walks: $U^2$ (trivial) $UR^xU$ followed by forced moves, $1 \le x \le n-1$ $UR^xDR^{1+} \rightarrow W(3,n-x-1) \rightarrow\text{ forced},\:1 \le x \le n-2$ $R^xU^2L^{1+} \rightarrow W(x,2),\:1 \le x \le n-1$ $R^xUL^{1+} \rightarrow W(x,2),\:1 \le x \le n-1$ $R^xUR^yU \rightarrow L^{y+1} \rightarrow W(x,2),\:x,y \ge 1,\:x+y \le n-1$ $R^xUR^yDR^{1+} \rightarrow W(3,n-x-y-1) \rightarrow L^{y+2} \rightarrow W(x,2),\:x,y \ge 1,\:x+y \le n-2$ Of these the path count involves: single summation for cases 2-5 double summation for cases 6,7 recursion in cases 3,7 For the contribution from case 7, I get: $R_7(3,n) = \cases{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{x=1}^{n-3}\sum\limits_{y=1}^{n-x-2}{R(3,n-x-y-1)\cdot2^{x-1}}, n>3 \\ 0, \text{ otherwise}}$ This seems a bit too complicated; is there a neater way of classifying walks?","I am not sure how to get a closed-form formula for $R(3,n)$ as the recursion involves a summation.

Firstly, let me explain the notation, which I used above: Ramsey's Theorem for c colors states that: For every positive integer $c \geq 2$ and positive integers $n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c} \geq 2$ there exists a (minimal) positive integer $\mathcal{R}(n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c})$ with the following property: If we color the edges of a complete graph of $\mathcal{R}(n_{1},n_{2}, \cdots ,n_{c})$ vertices with colors $1,2, \cdots , c$ then for some $i \in \{1,2, \cdots c\}$ there exists a complete subgraph with $n_{i}$ vertices whose edges are $i$ -colored. So, to prove $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)=17$ , we have to 3-color the edges of a $K_{16}$ avoiding monochromatic triangles. The three colored $K_{16}$ without monochromatic triangles that you get from Sun and Cohen's coloring is the following $\mathcal{R}(3,3,3)>16$ ""> My question Tomescu in his proof uses the following coloring: Let $P$ be a pentagon and $M=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ the set of its vertices. Let $X$ be the set of vertices of the graph $K_{16}$ and $Y$ be the set of subsets of $M$ with even cardinality. Let $f$ be any bijection from $X$ to $Y$ . The edges of $K_{16}$ will be colored as follows: If $a,b \in X$ and $a \neq b$ color the edge joining $a$ and $b$ according to the following rule: with color $c_{1}$ if $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ is a side of $P$ with color $c_{2}$ if $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ is a diagonal of $P$ with color $c_{3}$ if $|f(a) \triangle f(b)|=4$ where $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ represents the symmetric difference between the vertex sets $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ , which must clearly be an even number of vertices of $P$ , and in the case of 2 vertices we treat it as an edge. I am having trouble understanding the argument that he uses in order to prove that there are no monochromatic triangles by contradiction. The argument goes like this: Suppose that there is a triangle with sides colored $c_{1}$ and having vertices $a,b,c$ . It can be seen that $f(a) \triangle f(b), f(a) \triangle f(c)$ and $f(b) \triangle f(c)$ are sides of the polygon $P$ .        But $$(f(a) \triangle f(b)) \triangle (f(b) \triangle f(c)) = f(a) \triangle f(c)$$ and thus $ f(a) \triangle f(c)$ cannot be a side of the polygon $P$ . In fact, if the sides $f(a) \triangle f(b)$ and $f(b) \triangle f(c)$ have a common vertex, then their symmetric difference is a diagonal of the pentagon $P$ and hence  the edge joining $a$ and $c$ is colored $c_{2}$ . If the sides have no common vertex, then their symmetric difference has cardinality 4 and thus the edge joining $a$ and $c$ is colored $c_{3}$ , which is a contradiction. An analogos argument can be used if it is supposed that the monochromatic triangle is colored $c_{2}$ or $c_{3}$ . Why $ f(a) \triangle f(c)$ cannot be a side of the polygon? Why is it true that if two sides have a common vertex then its symmetric difference is a diagonal? Why is it true that if they do not have a common vertex then its symmetric difference is of cardinality 4?

73,Two different answers for combinatorics question - which is correct?,Two different answers for combinatorics question - which is correct?,,"At my wife's insistence, we have twelve food and water bowls for our three cats—nine circular (i.e. with circular cross-section) and three elliptical. I've just washed them all, and I'm wondering in how many ways I can put them down for the cats. Here are the rules I've (informally) developed: There are two water bowls and three food bowls for the three cats. The three elliptical bowls are a set; they go down together. The elliptical bowls are too shallow to be used for water bowls; they're only ever used as food bowls. Thus, when I'm putting down food and water bowls, the two water bowls are always selected from the circular bowls. The three food bowls are either all circular or all elliptical; never a mix. I took two approaches to solving the problem and got two very different answers; I'm not sure which, if either, is correct. Approach 1: First, take out the two water bowls (which must be circular); there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to do that. Then, take out the three food bowls. For these, I can choose either three of the remaining seven circular bowls ($\binom{7}{3} = 35$ possibilities) or the three elliptical bowls ($1$ possibility).

Which, if either, of these is correct, and why is the other (or why are both) wrong?","At my wife's insistence, we have twelve food and water bowls for our three cats—nine circular (i.e. with circular cross-section) and three elliptical. I've just washed them all, and I'm wondering in how many ways I can put them down for the cats. Here are the rules I've (informally) developed: There are two water bowls and three food bowls for the three cats. The three elliptical bowls are a set; they go down together. The elliptical bowls are too shallow to be used for water bowls; they're only ever used as food bowls. Thus, when I'm putting down food and water bowls, the two water bowls are always selected from the circular bowls. The three food bowls are either all circular or all elliptical; never a mix. I took two approaches to solving the problem and got two very different answers; I'm not sure which, if either, is correct. Approach 1: First, take out the two water bowls (which must be circular); there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to do that. Then, take out the three food bowls. For these, I can choose either three of the remaining seven circular bowls ($\binom{7}{3} = 35$ possibilities) or the three elliptical bowls ($1$ possibility). Thus, the total number of combinations of water and food bowls is $36 * (35 + 1) = 1296$.

88,Number of teams and matches,Number of teams and matches,,"This question has two parts. Given n players, how many different teams can be created with at least one and at most n-1 players?

The answer should therefore be $2^n-2$. How many different matches can be created between the teams from 1) such that no player meets himself and each team meet only one?
