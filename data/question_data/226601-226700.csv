1,Height of a prime ideal and number of generators.,Height of a prime ideal and number of generators.,,"Let $k$ be a field and $A=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\big/(I)$ where $I$ is a prime ideal and $\operatorname{dim}(A)=1$, i.e $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is a curve. I want to construct a dense open set $U \subset \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ such that $U$ is a normal scheme. To do this I want to take as open set, $$U=\{ x \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)| x \text{ is a smooth point}\}$$ since the notion of smoothness and normality coincide in dimension $1$. Furthermore the generic point $\eta \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ corresponding to the zero ideal is clearly smooth so density of $U$ follows. I'm having problems finishing the proof that $U$ is actually open. Since $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is catenary it follows by the dimension formula, $$ \operatorname{dim}(k[x_1,\dots,x_n])= \dim(A)+ \operatorname{ht}(I)$$ that $I$ has dimension $n-1$. Now this implies that the minimal number of generators of $I$ must be greater of equal to $n-1$. Let us denote the cardinality of this set $\mu(I)$ and assume that $\mu(I)=n-1$. Then we can use the Jacobian criterion for smoothness to show that $x \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ is smooth if and only if the rank of the Jacobian at that point is maximal. Therefore a point is not smooth if and only if the rank of the Jacobian is not maximal and this corresponds to the point $x$ satisfying some polynomial equations that clearly constitute a closed set in $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. However if $\mu(I)=n$ for example then this argument fails.

What I am confused about is using that property to induce the sheaf structure on $\textit{all}$ the open sets. I think the best way is to break my question into a few parts. 1) I want to use the gluing property for sheaves. To do that, I need a sheaf on each of the distinguished open sets. Say we have a distinguished open set $D(f)$. This has a cover by the intersections of $D(f)$ with all the other $D(g_{i})$ (and by quasicompactness this can be a finite cover, say with $p$ elements).

Is it true that every element of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(D(f_{i}))$ is realized as a restriction of an element of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$? 3) My intuition tells me that if $V \subset U$, then the ring of regular functions $\mathcal{O}_{X}(V)$ should be in some sense ""bigger"" than the ring of regular functions $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$, since being regular on a subset is surely a weaker statement.

Thus we can find some $f \in \mathcal{O}_X(U)$ such that the image of $f$ under this closed immersion is precisely $g.$ The divisor of $(f)$is clearly the same as that of $D,$so we're done. Does this seem OK or am I wrong?",,['algebraic-geometry']
43,Question about proof that the Grassmannian is a parameter space,Question about proof that the Grassmannian is a parameter space,,"Edit: If it is easier to give a reference where this is written down in detail, I would gladly accept that as an answer. Fix a base scheme $B$, and fix $n$ and $k$ with $k<n$. In section 28.3 of Vakil's notes, there is a sketch of the proof that the Grassmannian -- defined as the scheme that represents the functor classifying surjections $\mathcal O_B^n \rightarrow \mathcal G$ onto rank $k$ locally free sheaves -- is the parameter space for closed subschemes of $\mathbb P^{n-1}_B$ (finitely presented and flat over $B$) whose fibers over points in the base are linearly embedded copies of $\mathbb P^k_{k(b)}$. In it, he shows how to get from rank $k$ surjections to closed subschemes, and from closed subschemes to rank $k$ surjections. I'm having trouble showing these are actually inverse operations.

(Which would tell us that the colimit presheaf is already a sheaf.) The map $F(U) \to \Pi F(U_a)$ is clearly still injective (because $\Pi F(U_i)$ injects in $\Pi F(U_a)$). What seems unclear is this: if $f_a$ is in the kernel at the second slot, from the data of the $f_i$ (and the $U_{ij}$) we get an $f \in F(U)$ with the property that $f|_{U_i} = f_i$. However, this $f$ only has $f|_{U_a \cap U_i} = f_a|_{U_a \cap U_i}$, for the cover $U_{ia}$ of $U_a$. But $F$ is not known to be separated, so it is not clear that then $f|_{U_a} = f_a$.

First let me paraphrase some definitions in the book (given between p.32-37) to the best of my understanding (they're not very precise but neither are they in the book!): A tree of $\mathbb P^1$s is a union $C=\bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i$ where each $\phi_i:\mathbb P^1\xrightarrow{\cong}C_i$ is a curve, glued along a finite collection of pairs of points (called nodes ) $(p_j, q_j)\in C_{k(j)}\times C_{l(j)}$ for distinct indices $1\leq k(j), l(j) \leq r$ and avoiding cycles - finite sequences of distinct nodes $p_{j_1},p_{j_2}, \dots, p_{j_k} = p_{j_1}$ where a single component of $C$ contains both $p_{j_l}$ and $p_{j_{l+1}}$. A morphism $f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n$ is a map such that each $f_i :=f\circ\phi_i:\mathbb P^1 \rightarrow\mathbb P^n$ is a morphism of varieties. The degree of $f$ is the sum of the degrees of the $f_i$.

The degree of the stable map is the same thing as its degree as a tree morphism. An isomorphism of stable maps $g:(f:C\rightarrow\mathbb P^n)\rightarrow(f':C'\rightarrow\mathbb P^n)$ is a morphism $g:C\rightarrow C'$ such that $f'\circ g = f$; For each $C_i$, $g(C_i) = C'_j$ and for any $j$, there is a unique $i$ with $g(C_i)=C'_j$; $(\phi_j)^{-1} \circ g\circ \phi_i:\mathbb P^1\rightarrow\mathbb P^1$ is a morphism (hence automorphism?) whenever $g(C_i)\subseteq C'_j$.

Determine that property of a field $k$ will ensure that the result holds for $\phi: k\rightarrow k^2$ given by the same formula. Here is how I did the first part: By division algorithm, I can write $$f(X,Y)=(Y^2-X^3)f_1(X,Y)+Yf_2(X)+f_3(X)$$ Since $f(t^2,t^3)=0$ for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$, we have, for all $t$, $$t^3f_2(t^2)+f_3(t^2)=0$$ Comparing the odd and even power terms of $t$ gives $$f_2(X)=f_3(X)=0$$ This shows $f$ is divisible by $Y^2-X^3$.

99,Morphisms of quasi-affine varieties and locally closed sub-varieties,Morphisms of quasi-affine varieties and locally closed sub-varieties,,"The Problem Let $\varphi:X\to Y$ be a morphism of quasi-affine varieties. Let $Z\subset X$ be a locally closed sub-variety (that is, $Z$ is an open sub variety of a closed subvariety). Show that $\varphi|_Z:Z\to Y$ is also a morphism. Necessary Definitions A quasi-affine variety is a topological space $X$ together with an algebra of $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions $\mathcal{O}(X)$ such that: There is a homeomorphism $\psi:X\to U_X$ where $U_X$ is an open subset of an algebraic set in $\mathbb{C}^n$ for some $n$. The induced algebra homomorphism $\psi^*:\mathcal{O}(U_X)\to \mathcal{O}(X)$ is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. A morphism of quasi-affine varieties is a map $\Psi:X\to Y$ between quasi-affine varieties such that for every $f\in \mathcal{O}(Y)$, $f\circ \Psi\in \mathcal{O}(X)$. Discussion My first observation is that we should be able to reduce the problem to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are open subsets of algebraic sets, i.e. we can replace them by $U_X$ and $U_Y$ and suppose that $\varphi:U_X\to U_Y.$ (Although I don't know if this should be necessary) My biggest problem with this question is that I don't know what exactly the ring of functions $\mathcal{O}(Z)$ should be for a locally closed subset $Z$ of $U_X$. Abusing notation I will write $X$ for the algebraic set $U_X$ belongs to and $Y$ for the one $U_Y$ belongs to. I do know how to describe $\mathcal{O}(U_X)$ (or more generally the $\mathcal{O}(U)$ for an open subset $U$ of an algebraic set): $f:U_X\to \mathbb{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}(U_X)$ if there exists an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U_X$ such that on $U_i$, $f=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in U_i$. Since $\varphi:U_X\to U_Y$ is a morphism, for all $f\in \mathcal{O}(U_Y)$, $f\circ \varphi\in \mathcal{O}(U_X)$, that is, there exists an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U_X$ such that on $U_i$, $f\circ \varphi=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in U_i$ (*). Let $Z=U\cap X'$  where $U$ is an open sub-variety of $U_X$ and $X'$ is a closed sub-variety. By $(*)$ we have that for all $f\in \mathcal{O}(U_Y)$,  there is a cover $Z=\cup_i V_i$ (With $V_i=U_i\cap U\cap X'$) such that on $V_i$,   $f\circ \varphi|_Z=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in V_i$ Is this equvialent to saying $f\circ \varphi|_Z$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}(Z)$? This depends on how $\mathcal{O}(Z)$ is characterized, and this I am unsure of. Maybe someone has some insight into this?","The Problem Let $\varphi:X\to Y$ be a morphism of quasi-affine varieties.
