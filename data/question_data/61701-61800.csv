Prove that the $n^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer relatively prime to $n$ is at least $\sigma(n)$ , and determine for which $n$ equality holds. My Progress: Really hard problem!!! Obviously, I looked at examples! For n=2, $\sigma(2)=3$ and the second positive relatively prime to 2 was 3. For n=3, $\sigma(3)=4$ and the third positive relatively prime to 3 was 4. For n=4, $\sigma(4)=1+2+4=7$ and the fourth positive relatively prime to 4 was 7. For n=5, $\sigma(5)=1+5=6$ and the fifth positive relatively prime to 5 was 6. For n=6, $\sigma(6)=3\cdot 4=12$ but the sixth  positive relatively prime to 6 was 17. So, from here I conjectured that the equality case is true  if and only if $n =$ perfect power of a prime. Firstly, let $S(n)$ be the $n^{\text{th}}$ smallest positive integer relatively prime to $n$ . Now, for $n=$ prime.It works, since $\sigma(n)=p+1$ and $S(n)=p+1$ , since only $p$ is not relatively prime to $p$ and $p+1$ is . Before proceeding further I would like to state the formula which I got and can be proved by induction or just simple modular arithmetic . For a given integer $x$ and a perfect power of prime $""l^k""$ . We get that $x$ is the $[x-Q(x,l)]^{\text{th}}$ number which is relatively prime to $l^k$ . where $Q(x,l)$ is the quotient when $x$ is divided by $l$ . Now $n=p^k$ , for some prime $p$ and $k>1$ . So we get that, $\sigma(p^k)= 1+p^2+\dots +p^k$ . We claim that $S(p^k)=1+p^2+\dots +p^k$ . we can prove this by using the fact that $S(n)$ is unique or in other words , we can show that $1+p^2+\dots +p^k$ is the ${p^k}^{\text{th}}$ relatively prime number  rather than finding the ${p^k}^{th}$ relatively prime number . But by the formula we stated, we get that $1+p^2+\dots +p^k$ is the $[1+p^2+\dots +p^k - Q(1+p^2+\dots +p^k,p)]=[1+p^2+\dots +p^k -(1+p^2+\dots +p^{k-1})]= p^k$ And we are done! I am stuck in showing that equality case doesn't for multiples prime . The handout which I am using, gave these hints for the general problem: $1$ . $\sum_{d|n} \phi(d)=n$ . $2$ . We basically reverse construct the $\sigma(n$ ) as the sum of the divisors and construct intervals which each have a different $d_i$ number of relatively prime numbers. I couldn't even understand the $2^{\text{nd}}$ hint. Please give a try to this beautiful problem and hope one can give me hints for this problem.

Background info: For instance, in here : Since $R(r, s) ≤ R(r − 1, s) + R(r, s − 1)$ so this automatically gives an upper bound, although not in the closed form that we expect. The closed form expression is ${\displaystyle R(r,s)\leq {\binom {r+s-2}{r-1}}}.$ To derive this use double induction on $r$ and $s.$ The base case $r = s = 2$ is easily established as $${\displaystyle R(2,2)=2\leq {\binom {2+2-2}{2-1}}=2}.$$ Now assume the expression holds for $R(r − 1, s)$ and $R(r, s − 1).$ Then $${\displaystyle R(r,s)\leq R(r-1,s)+R(r,s-1)\leq {\binom {r+s-3}{r-2}}+{\binom {r+s-3}{r-1}}={\binom {r+s-2}{r-1}}}$$ gives us our upper bound. Note that we have used Pascal's relation in the last equivalence. But why did they start already applying the binomial formula they intend to prove in ${\displaystyle R(2,2)=2\leq {\binom {2+2-2}{2-1}}=2},$ and how does the inductive process proceed from that point? I see there are related questions, and in fact, I have tried to contribute with a possible answer as to the proof of a finite Ramsey number for every combination of two natural numbers here to get feedback. However, I still have problems with the immediately related proof of the inequality ( theorem of Erdős-Szekeres ): $$R(s,t) \leq \binom{s+t-2}{s-1}$$ as in here : I see that this inequality is fulfilled by the base cases, as well as $s+t<5,$ but I presume other inequalities could also be fulfilled by the first Ramsey numbers. In the following two answers that I found online it seems as though the Ramsey number on, say $(r,t),$ i.e. $R(r,t)$ is somewhat just replaced by $r$ and $t$ in the combinatorics solution. So I don't get the analogy to Pascal's triangle... Solution 1: The answer can be found here : $$R(k,l) \leq \binom{k+l-2}{k-1}$$ because the recurrence $$R(k,l) \leq R(k-1,l) + R(k,l-1) $$ can be seen as the paths from a point $R(k,l)$ on the grid below to $(1,1):$ and the number of ways to get to a point on a lattice $(x,y)$ taking off from $(0,0)$ are: $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$ Here we are moving in the opposite direction, and stopping at $(1,1),$ which reduces the count to: $$\binom{(x-1)+(y-1)}{x-1}=\binom{x+y-2}{x-1}$$ ""We’ve placed the value $1$ at each position $(k, 1)$ or $(1, l)$ in this grid, corresponding to the base case $r(k, 1) = r(1, l) = 1$ of our induction. At the point $(k, l)$ in the grid, we know that the value $r(k, l)$ at that point is upper-bounded by the sum of the values immediately below and immediately to the left. Applying this same recurrence to these adjacent nodes, we see that every left/down path from $(k, l)$ to the boundary will contribute $1$ in the final sum (corresponding to the value $1$ at the boundary points). Thus, $r(k, l)$ is upper-bounded by the number of left/down paths to the boundary, which is in turn equal to the number of left/down paths from $(k, l)$ to $(1, 1),$ which is exactly $\binom{k+l-2}{k-1}.""$ Solution 2: From here :","The question : How did Erdös - Szekeres came up with a close form with a binomial for the upper bound: Where does the idea behind -  I do see that - or come from? And how is the induction over and work? What I understand: I see that I understand that - Pascal's triangle. I also see that the relationship holds. And I get it that The problem: There are tons of sites where the proof of the inequality above is readily available, including one of the answers to this post.

41,Integrating the product of lines.,Integrating the product of lines.,,"The Question. Suppose we have $n$ linear functions $f_k$ defined on $[x_1,x_2]$ . Let $f_k(x_1)=y_k$ and $f_k(x_2)=z_k$ denote the function values at the endpoints of the interval. We would like to calculate $$\mathfrak{P}(n)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \prod_{k=1}^n f_k(x) \, dx$$ in terms of $x_1,x_2,$ and $y_k, z_k$ for $k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ . The motivation for this comes from mathematical programming-- specifically, an algorithm I'm writing that requires integrating the product of a large number of piecewise linear functions. What I would like is to find a closed form for $\mathfrak{P}(n)$ . Let's work through a few examples and see if a formula jumps out at us. Example: $n=2$ The first thing to do is write the $f_k$ in terms of the endpoint values. Solving $f_k(x_1)=mx_1+b=y_k$ and $f_k(x_2)=mx_2+b=z_k$ , we get $$f_k(x)=\frac{z_k-y_k}{x_2-x_1}x+\frac{y_k x_2-z_kx_1}{x_2-x_1}$$ So, then, we are calculating $$ \mathfrak{P}(2)=\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \left(\frac{z_1-y_1}{x_2-x_1}x+\frac{y_1 x_2-z_1x_1}{x_2-x_1}\right)\left(\frac{z_2-y_2}{x_2-x_1}x+\frac{y_2 x_2-z_2x_1}{x_2-x_1}\right) \, dx $$ which, God help us, is $$ \left.\frac{x \left(3 x (y_1 z_2 (x_1+x_2)+y_2 z_1 (x_1+x_2)-2 x_1 z_1 z_2-2 x_2 y_1 y_2)+6 (x_1 z_1-x_2 y_1) (x_1 z_2-x_2 y_2)+2 x^2 (y_1-z_1) (y_2-z_2)\right)}{6 (x_1-x_2){}^2}\right|_{x_1}^{x_2} $$ Luckily, this simplifies quite a bit down to $$ \frac{1}{6} (x_2-x_1)(y_1 (2 y_2+z_2)+z_1 (y_2+2 z_2)). $$ Alright!

45,Intuition for Möbius function on a poset,Intuition for Möbius function on a poset,,"I am attempting to learn about Möbius inversion in the context of partial order theory. However, I'm hitting a bit of a mental block when it comes to understanding the Möbius function, and I'm looking for a clearer understanding of the motivation and intuition behind it. Rota , for example, defines the function inductively as follows: $$ \mu(x,x)=1 $$ $$ \mu(x,y) = -\sum_{x\le z<y} \mu(x,z) $$ but then says ""clearly $\mu$ is an inverse of $\zeta$"". Unfortunately it's far from clear to me! The definition doesn't seem to give me any intuition for what this function is, how I should expect it to behave, or even really how to do algebra with it. I've tried tabulating all the values of $\mu$ for a few small lattices, and I can verify that it is indeed an inverse of $\zeta$ in those cases, but it hasn't been very enlightening - I haven't been able to discern any meaning in the numbers it assigns. In short, my question is, what is the Möbius function? How should I think about what it's doing, and how can I see its fundamental properties? A note about my background: I'm working on applications in probability theory and information theory and I have zero knowledge of number theory --- so motivations and analogies from that direction won't help me, unless they can be explained starting from a novice level. Edit: it's now clear to me that $\mu$ is indeed an inverse of $\zeta$. It helped to realise that for finite posets we can write these functions as matrices, in which case convolution is matrix multiplication and $\mu$ is the matrix inverse of $\zeta$. However, I'm still looking for a good explanation of what $\mu$ ""really is"", other than a convenient algebraic tool. I suspect this question has an answer, because if my poset is a family of sets with the partial order relation being set inclusion, then $\mu$ seems to be saying something about which things you have to subtract off to avoid double-counting. (i.e. the inclusion-exclusion principle.) It's this intuition that I'd like to get a firmer handle on, particularly when it comes to general posets where the order relation is not set inclusion.","I am attempting to learn about Möbius inversion in the context of partial order theory.

65,Is there an upper bound on the growth rate of analytic functions?,Is there an upper bound on the growth rate of analytic functions?,,"This problem comes from a solution tactic used in Is there a rational surjection $\Bbb N\to\Bbb Q$? , where I discovered that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ that takes the values $f(n)=a_n$ for all $n\in\Bbb N$, as long as $a_n$ has at most polynomial growth; here I am interested in seeing how far I can relax the ""polynomial growth"" constraint. Let us call an analytic function a kernel if it satisfies $k(0)=1$ and $k(n)=0$ for all $0\ne n\in\Bbb Z$. The main kernel used in the above question/answer was the function ${\rm sincz}(z)=\frac\pi z\sin(\frac z\pi)$, which has growth rate $O(z^{-1})$ (in the positive and negative real direction). Then ${\rm sincz}^m(z)$ is also a kernel, with growth rate $O(z^{-m})$, and any kernel yields an analytic function via $f(z)=\sum_{n\in\Bbb N}a_nk(n)$, which works for all sequences whose growth rate is no more than $O(\frac1{k(n)n^2})$ (or substitute some other summable series for $n^{-2}$). But if $k$ is a kernel and $g$ is any analytic function with $g(0)=1$, then $g(z)k(z)$ is also a kernel, which allows for much faster-decaying kernels, such as $e^{-z^2}{\rm sincz}(z)$. In fact, given any eventually monotonic analytic function $g(z)$ with $g(0)=1$, the function $\frac{{\rm sincz}^2(z)}{g(z^2)}$ is a kernel with growth rate $O(\frac1{g(z^2)z^2})$, which can create analytic functions for any sequence of growth rate less than $O(g(n^2))\supseteq O(g(n))$. So the problem is reduced to the question in the title: Is there any upper bound on the growth rate of analytic functions? That is, is there a definable sequence $a_n$ which grows so fast that it eventually outpaces any analytic function $f(z)$ sampled at the natural numbers? The examples given still fall far short of such fast-growing functions as the Ackermann function or Graham's sequence, but it is not obvious to me that there are not similar techniques for producing extremely fast-growing analytic functions.","This problem comes from a solution tactic used in Is there a rational surjection $\Bbb N\to\Bbb Q$? , where I discovered that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ that takes the values $f(n)=a_n$ for all $n\in\Bbb N$, as long as $a_n$ has at most polynomial growth; here I am interested in seeing how far I can relax the ""polynomial growth"" constraint.

By evenly I mean that I would like the density of points to be nearly constant throughout the grid (avoid points concentrating in certain regions as much as possible). This problem seems to be quite tough (I am not a mathematician so I did not know that beforehand :). I found this paper that seemed to address a similar problem, and there they mention that a good strategy if you have a grid that is $2^k \times 2^k$ (which I can make because my grid is arbitrary) is to pick the largest empty circle and place the point at its center. So my questions are: Is that so? If it is, how do I guarantee that if I get several largest circles I don't accumulate the points as I am placing the points online? What is a good way to implement that? I am looking at matlab but it does not seem obvious to me how to compute the largest available circle every time (I would have to sweep all the available points for placement and compute this, which will take long time). But again I am not a computer science guy either. Any hint / help would be appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: to be more specific based on the comments so far, I should say that I have tried a couple of things: 1) a code I found in http://www.softimageblog.com/archives/115 posted by Anton Sherwood, which uses two relatively prime numbers to generate a pattern. This can create adequate patterns for certain combinations in R^2 but when I round the result it groups the points. I though this approach was the Halton sequences because of the prime numbers but I am not sure now. 2) I used a true Halton sequence following one of the comments, but this gave a somewhat random distribution (which is what it is supposed to do) My problem is deterministic, as I know my grid (actually I can chose it arbitrarily with some constraints) and I also know the number of points I want to place inside, so I was more looking for a deterministic approach to place the points to achieve even distribution (as in the paper I first mentioned).

I've been looking to buy a dowelling jig which, if you don't know, is a woodworking tool that lets you drill dowel holes into a piece of wood.

For example, the dowelmax has spacers that are these thicknesses (in inches): 1/8, 3/8, 6/8, 13/8. If you need an offset that isn't one of these numbers, then you can combine them.

If so, I'd be very appreciated if you shared those. $\text{2)}$ The case of $n = 2$ is so obvious that we can eliminate that from consideration. We can do the same thing to an obvious condition in $\mathbb{W}$ (if $\mathbb{W} \neq \varnothing$): $\left ( \sum_{i \in S} i \right ) \; \vdots \; 2$. Thanks in advance. ${}$ Update 1: To clear many people's misunderstanding and to avoid it for new ones, I emphasize the word ""different"" above. And by ""different"", I mean different indices of numbers, not their values. If this is still not clear, I think we should consider $S$ as a finite natural sequence ($a_1$ to $a_n$) and not delete any of them once they become $0$. Update 2: (d) has been renewed a little, thank to Greg Martin.",,"['combinatorics', 'algorithms', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorial-game-theory', 'algorithmic-game-theory']"
88,Formal proof $\binom{n}{k}$ is an integer,Formal proof  is an integer,\binom{n}{k},"In mathematics one defines: $\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\k\end{array}\right)=\displaystyle\frac{n!}{k!\cdot (n-k)!}$ This is the number of combinations of $k$ elements from a collection of $n$ elements. I was wondering if it is possible to prove that the result is an integer in a formal way. It's easy to see that $k!$ in the denominator divides the numerator, but how do you prove that the denominator $k!$ also divides the product of all elements between $n-k+1$ and $n$?","In mathematics one defines: $\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\k\end{array}\right)=\displaystyle\frac{n!}{k!\cdot (n-k)!}$ This is the number of combinations of $k$ elements from a collection of $n$ elements.
