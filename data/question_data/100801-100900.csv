48,Difficult Recurrence,Difficult Recurrence,,"I am trying to solve a Sangaku problem. The blue circles have radii one. The goal is to find the total area of all the other circles (the three sequences of circles repeat ad infinitum). I have almost solved the problem. I have found the area of the red circle, and the total area of all circles touching the horizontal axis. I even have a proposed recurrence for the radius of the circles going up the center. Here is my logic: Take any circle on the vertical stack. Draw a right triangle with one vertex at its center, one at the center of the (left) blue circle, and one vertex below the blue circle's center level with the other vertex. One leg of this triangle has length one, and the hypotenuse is $1 + r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle in question. The other leg has length one minus the sum of $r$ and the diameters of all circles below. There is just one unknown and these quantities are uniquely related by the Pythagorean theorem. So we have a recurrence. $R(n)$ denotes the radius of the $n^{th}$ circle on the vertical stack, with $n=1$ the red circle. After manipulating the expression from the Pythagorean theorem, we get $$\begin{align*} R(1) &= 1/4 \\ R(n) &= \dfrac{\left(1 - 2\sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} R(k)\right)^2}{4\left(1 - \sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} R(k)\right)} \end{align*}$$ This is where I am stuck. I am looking for any sort of help in solving for a closed form of $R$. Thanks (For those interested, here is my work on the first part of the problem. If you spot a mistake here, feel free to point it out, but my main question is how to solve the above recurrence.) Revival of Sangaku Take any three circles that are $(1)$ all tangent to the horizontal axis and $(2)$ touching one another. The radius of the middle one can be given in terms of the radii of the two outer circles by   $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{r_{mid}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_2}}$$ Let's see why the relationship holds. Let $(x_{mid}, y_{mid})$ denote the center of the middle circle. Let, let $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ be the centers of the outer circles, with radii equal to $r_1$ and $r_2$. Draw three right triangles: $\triangle_1$ with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_{mid}, y_{mid})$, and $(x_1, y_{mid})$, $\triangle_2$ with vertices $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_{mid}, y_{mid})$, and $(x_2, y_{mid})$, and $\triangle_3$ with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, and $(x_1, y_2)$. The hypotenuse of each triangle is the sum of the radii of the two circles involved. Furthermore, one leg equals the difference of the larger radius from the smaller. Thus, the length of the third leg equals twice the square root of the product of the radii involved. (Draw a picture here, use Pythagorean's Theorem) Furthermore, the sum of the lengths of the third leg of $\triangle_1$ and $\triangle_2$ equal the length of the the third leg of $\triangle_3$. Formally, $$\begin{align*} (r_1 + r_{mid})^2 &= leg(\triangle_1)^2 + (r_1 - r_{mid})^2 \\ (r_2 + r_{mid})^2 &= leg(\triangle_2)^2 + (r_2 - r_{mid})^2 \\ (r_1 + r_2)^2 &= leg(\triangle_3)^2 + (r_1 - r_2)^2 \\ leg(\triangle_1) + leg(\triangle_2) &= leg(\triangle_3) \\ &\implies \\ \sqrt{(r_1 + r_{mid})^2 - (r_1 - r_{mid})^2} &+ \sqrt{(r_2 + r_{mid})^2 - (r_2 - r_{mid})^2} \\ &= \sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 - (r_1 - r_2)^2} \\ &\implies \\ 2\sqrt{r_1r_{mid}} + 2\sqrt{r_2r_{mid}} &= 2\sqrt{r_1r_2} \\ &\implies \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_2}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{r_{mid}}} \end{align*}$$ Now let's focus on the sequence of circles descending to the left. Let $R : \{1, 2, 3, ... \} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ define the radius of the $n^{th}$ circle, where we start with the left circle of radius one, then move to the red circle, then left to the green circle, then to the orange, etc. $$\begin{align*}  R(1) &= 1 \\  \frac{1}{\sqrt{R(n)}} &= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{R(n-1)}} + 1  \end{align*}$$   Notice that we can make the following substitution:    $$T(n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{R(n)}}$$   Then $T(n) = T(n-1) + 1$, with $T(1) = 1$, so $T(n) = n$. Solving for $R(n)$ gives us $$R(n) = \dfrac{1}{n^2}$$ Thus each circle has area $\pi n^{-4}$. So the total area of the nested circles touching the horizontal line is   $$\pi\left(2^{-4} + 2\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} k^{-4}\right)$$ Now, you can use rigorous elementary methods, the Riemann zeta function, or WolframAlpha to compute   $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} k^{-4} = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$$   So,    $$\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} k^{-4} = \frac{\pi^4}{90} - \frac{17}{16}$$   and so the total area of the circles touching the horizontal axis is   $$\pi\left(\frac{\pi^4}{45} - \frac{33}{16}\right)$$","I am trying to solve a Sangaku problem.

55,Chain of circles internally tangent to an ellipse.,Chain of circles internally tangent to an ellipse.,,"I tried to get an answer to this question (which was hastily closed) but couldn't find a proof, so I decided to ask it again, adding some of my efforts. Suppose we have a finite sequence of $n$ circles ( $n\ge10$ , see figure below) whose centres lie on the major axis of an ellipse. All circles are internally tangent to the ellipse and each circle is also externally tangent to the preceding and following circle (if they exist). If $r_1$ , $r_2$ , ..., $r_n$ are the radii of these circles, prove that: $$ r_7(r_1 + r_7) = r_4(r_4 + r_{10}). $$ If $x_0$ , $x_1$ , ..., $x_n$ are the abscissae of the intersection points between the circles and the major axis (taking as origin the ellipse centre, see figure above), then it is not difficult to find a recursive relation for $x_k$ . Let $a$ , $b$ be the semi-major axis and semi-minor axis of the ellipse, $A$ and $B$ its foci, $O$ its centre and $c=AO=BO=\sqrt{a^2-b^2}$ . If $C_k$ is the centre of $k$ -th circle and $P_k$ one of its tangency points with the ellipse, then radius $P_kC_k$ is the normal to the ellipse at $P_k$ and thus the bisector of $\angle AP_kB$ . It follows from the length of bisector formula that $$ P_kC_k={b^2\over a^2}\sqrt{AP_k\cdot BP_k}={b^2\over c^2}\sqrt{AC_k\cdot BC_k}= {b^2\over c^2}\sqrt{c^2-c_k^2}, $$ where $c_k$ is the abscissa of centre $C_k$ .  Inserting here $P_kC_k=(x_{k}-x_{k-1})/2$ and $c_k=(x_{k}+x_{k-1})/2$ ,  then squaring both sides and rearranging, one finds: $$ x_k^2+x_{k-1}^2-2(2e^2-1)x_kx_{k-1}=4e^2b^2, $$ where $e=c/a$ is the eccentricity of the ellipse. From the above recursive equation one can find, once $x_0$ is given, all $x_k$ and thus compute $r_k=(x_{k}-x_{k-1})/2$ for all values of $k$ .

75,Heron's Formula Intuitive Geometric Proof,Heron's Formula Intuitive Geometric Proof,,"This is not the usual request for an intuitive proof, which has been asked already. Having looked at various sources, I've basically concluded that Heron's formula relies on proving $$xyz = x+y+z$$ where $x$ , $y$ and $z$ are the lengths between the meeting point of the incircle and the sides, and the vertices. If I take the diagram below, $x$ is $CX$ , and $z$ is $XA$ . $y$ would be the segment from $B$ to the incircle meeting the side, marked by a black dot, which is also $YC$ . Hence $x+y+z=s$ where $s$ is the semiperimeter. From here it is easy to show that if the radius ( $r$ ) of the incircle is $1$ , then the area of the triangle is $x+y+z$ . The radius does not really matter, because when it comes to proving the formula, you can just proportionally reduce the size of the triangle by a factor of $1/r^2$ . So we can work with the $r=1$ case. Proving $xyz = x+y+z$ visually is not difficult by looking at this diagram: http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt725/Heron/Heron2/Heron2.html When $r = 1$ , then $EY = xy$ ( $x = (s-c)$ and $y = (s-b)$ since $s = x+y+z$ as defined above) and $EY$ is also equal to $s/z$ , so it is conceptually not difficult to show that $x+y+z = xyz$ and from this that $A^2 = (x+y+z)xyz = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$ . But to my mind, it would be even better if we could show that $xyz$ corresponds to the area of the triangle directly, rather than messing about with equivalences. If we take the $\Delta AYE$ triangle in the above diagram and form a rectangle, whose new vertex we call $P$ , and we extend a line from point $X$ to the side $EP$ , calling this new vertex $Q$ , then $PQXA$ is meant to be of the same area as the triangle, since $XA=z$ and $EY=xy$ .

These probes are evenly spaced at angles of $120^\circ$ from each other ( $\theta = 120^\circ$ ). The master part (blue circle), in which the measuring bung is seated, has a known inner bore diameter of $D$ . Refer to the diagram below (figure 1): However, it is important to note that the provided diagram does NOT accurately represent the real-world situation .

For a clearer representation, please refer to the revised diagram below (figure 2): The following variables are known : $a$ , $b$ , $c$ - the distances measured by the 3 probes $\theta$ - the probe mounting angle around the center of the    measuring bung $D$ - the bore diameter of the master part The following variables are unknown : $r_a$ , $r_b$ , $r_c$ - the probe mounting distances from the center ofthe measuring bung Objective: The objective is to find $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ .

If you are reading this and you are not Fedja, I recommend you read his answer instead of this. We will deploy the least-squares method to find numerical approximations of the $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ . Let's establish a few important functions: A mathematical expression for the radius, in terms of the variables a,b,c,ra,rb, and rc. I recommend referring to the answer provided by Joshua Wang for a detailed understanding. $R=\sqrt{\frac{\left(x^2+y^2+xy\right)\left(x^2+z^2+xz\right)\left(y^2+z^2+yz\right)}{3x^2y^2+3x^2z^2+3y^2z^2+6x^2yz+6{xy}^2z+6xyz^2}}$ The mean quadratic error G. This function returns the square root of the sum of the squared errors for each measurement point $(k)$ . It provides a measure of how well the given guess ( $r_a$ , $r_b$ , $r_c$ ) fits the measurements. This is the function that is being minimized in order to find the values of $r_a, r_b$ and $r_c$ that provides the best fit to the given measurements. $G\ =\ \sqrt{\frac{1}{K}\ \sum_{k=0}^{K}\left(Error_k\right)^2}$ Where, $K$ is the number of measurements. $Error_k=\sqrt{\frac{\left({x_k}^2+{y_k}^2+x_k\ast y_k\right)\left({x_k}^2+{z_k}^2+x_kz_k\right)\left({y_k}^2+{z_k}^2+y_kz_k\right)}{3{x_k}^2{y_k}^2+3{x_k}^2{z_k}^2+3{y_k}^2{z_k}^2+6{x_k}^2y_kz_k+6x_k{y_k}^2z+6\ast x_ky_k{z_k}^2}}-R$ Where $x_k=a_k+r_a $ $y_k=b_k+r_b $ $z_k=c_k+r_c $ $F(x,y,z)$ – This function is used as a constraint in the algorithm to ensure that the calculated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ satisfy the given measurements. $F\left(x,y,z\right)=3x^2y^2+3x^2z^2+3y^2z^2+6x^2yz+6{xy}^2z+6xyz^2-\frac{\left(x^2+y^2+xy\right)\left(x^2+z^2+xz\right)\left(y^2+z^2+yz\right)}{R^2}$ The partial derivatives of $F\left(x,y,z\right)\ - F_x\left(x,y,z\right)$ , $F_y\left(x,y,z\right)$ , $F_z\left(x,y,z\right)$ with respect to $x,\ y,\ z$ . The partial derivatives are an essential to optimization process as they directly affect magnitude and direction that $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ is incremented with each iteration ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ . $F_x(x,y,z) = 6xy^2+ 6xz^2+ 12xyz + 6y^2 z + 6yz^2 - \frac{(2x + y)(x^2+ z^2+ xz)(y^2+ z^2+ yz)}{R^2} -\frac{(x^2+ y^2+ xy)(2x + z)(y^2+ z^2+ yz)}{R^2} $ $F_y\left(x,y,z\right)=F_x\left(x,y,z\right) $ $F_z\left(x,y,z\right)=F_x\left(x,y,z\right) $ (Due to the symmetry of $F(x,y,z)$ ) An system of linear equations for the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ . These equations represent the conditions that need to be satisfied for the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ to ensure that the changes in the function $F\left(x,y,z\right)$ with respect to each variable are zero at the specific point ${(x}_k{,y}_k{,z}_k)$ . $F_x\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_a{+F}_y\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_b+F_z\left(x_k,y_k,z_k\right)dr_c=-F(x_k,y_k,z_k)$ The left-hand side of this equation represents change in $F$ at the point ${(x}_K{,y}_K{,z}_K)$ caused by the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ , while the right-hand side is the negative value of $F$ at that point. By setting them equal to each other, you are essentially trying to make the net change in $F$ equal to zero. This equation ensures that the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ are chosen in a way that counteracts the change in $F$ caused by variations in $(x, y, z)$ and moves the solution towards the desired minimum or maximum of $F$ with each iteration. $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_a=0 $ $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_b=0 $ $\frac{f(x_K,y_K,z_K)}{R}\ dr_c=0 $ These equations represent additional constraints on the increments ${(dr}_a{,dr}_b{,dr}_c)$ . These equations ensure that the increments ${dr}_a{,dr}_b$ and ${dr}_c$ are constrained in a way that aligns with the behaviour of the function $F(x_K,y_K,z_K)$ and its relationship with $R$ . By satisfying these conditions, the algorithm can find solutions that minimize the error and converge towards the desired result. With the required functions established lets define the steps of the iterative method. The following steps will be executed: Initialize the values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ to some initial guess, such as $R/2$ . Construct the matrices $U$ and $V$ by evaluating the partial derivatives and function values for each measurement point $k$ . Solve the system of linear equations to obtain the increments $V$ $V\ =\left(U^TU\right)^{-1}U^TV$ Update $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ by adding the corresponding elements of $V$ to the previous values. Check if any of the updated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , or $r_c$ are negative. If so, revert them back to their previous values. Calculate the mean quadratic error $G$ based on the updated values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ , and $r_c$ Compare the new mean quadratic error $G$ with the previous minimum error $e$ If it is lower, update $e$ and store the values of $r_a$ , $r_b$ and $r_c$ as the new suspected minimizer. Repeat steps 2-7 until the termination condition is met (e.g., when $e$ is within the desired tolerance or after a maximum number of iterations). We can now implement these steps.

I've also seen a few other questions hinting at this without a clear answer, see: Why is SSS criterion for congruence of triangles referred to as ""SSS postulate"" in textbooks? . Another question on math.SE asks what I'm asking (how can we derive the triangle congruence postulates from basic axioms?) Need for triangle congruency axioms and the accepted answer suggests only a quick visit to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry but does not discuss whether or not the triangle congruence axioms follow from the basic axioms or are independent of them.",,"['geometry', 'triangles', 'axioms']"

93,Unique characterization of convex polygons,Unique characterization of convex polygons,,"Question I am looking for a unique characterization of a convex polygon with $n$ vertices, relative to a feature point $p$ in the interior of the polygon. This characterization would be a vector of numbers. Suppose a polygon is described by its feature point and vertices $P=(p,v_1,\ldots,v_n)$, then the characterization function is $C(P)$ such that $C(P)=C(Q)$ if and only if $P$ is congruent* to $Q$. The most important thing I need is that for two polygons which are ""almost"" congruent, their characterization vectors should be ""close"" (like, say, small 2-norm difference). The question then is what is a simple definition of the characterization function $C(\cdot)$ which satisfies my requirements? *Here I define congruent as identical up to rotation and translation (reflections are not allowed), cyclic permutation of vertex indices, as well as identical feature point locations. If $P$ is congruent to $Q$, then any cyclic permutation of the vertices of either polygon should still leave $C(P)=C(Q)$ (thus $C$ should be invariant to cyclic permutations of the vertices). If two polygons are congruent, then when they are overlaid, the feature points of both polygons must also match up (this is why I originally stated that the polygon is defined relative to the feature point). An illustration of what I mean is shown below. The dots inside are the feature points of the surrounding polygon. Things that don't work Most characterizations of polygons usually calculate the 2x2 moment of inertial tensor relative to the center of mass of the polygon. This is not good enough because first of all, the moment tensor is not enough to completely define the shape, and second, the feature point of a polygon must also match for two congruent polygons. Ideas A vector of higher order moments relative to the feature point. (Is this unique?) A vector of displacements from a regular $n$-gon vertex positions.

94,"arc-arc intersection, arcs specified by endpoints and height","arc-arc intersection, arcs specified by endpoints and height",,"I need to compute the intersection(s) between two circular arcs. Each arc is specified by its endpoints and their height. The height is the perpendicular distance from the chord connecting the endpoints to the middle of the arc. I use this representation because it is numerically robust for very slightly bent arcs, as well as straight line segments, for which the height is zero. In these cases, representing an arc using the center of its circle could lead to the center being far far away from the endpoints of the arc, and hence, numerically unstable. My question at the highest level is how I would go about computing the intersection points, given that the centers of the circles of the arcs cannot necessarily be computed robustly. At a lower level, I am wondering if there is a parameterization of an arc using only the information I have stated above (which does not include the circle center). Of course, keep in mind numerical robustness is my principal concern here; otherwise I would just do the naive thing and compute the circle center for all non-linear arcs and hope for the best. Edit : Formula for computing center of circle of arcs: Suppose the chord length is $2t$, and the height is $h$. The distance from the chord to the circle center is $c$, so that $r=h+c$. Then it follows that $c=(t^2-h^2)/2h$, which breaks down when $h$ is very small.

Let $R(n)$ be the radius of the sphere for which the intersection $C\cap S_{R(n)}$ has maximal area.  What is the asymptotic behavior of $R(n)$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$? Background : For an n dimensional ball, the mass on a shell of radius $r$ grows like $r^{n-1}$ right up to the boundary of the ball.  Knowing where the mass is located on a high dimensional object is useful for e.g. statistical mechanics. By comparison to the ball case, you might expect that the mass of a cube would also be near the farthest extremity, which for the case of $C$, above, would be at the vertices, distance $\sqrt{n}$ from the center.  However, there is an argument why there is not much mass near the vertices:  Consider centering little balls on each of the vertices and looking at the volume of the intersection of the balls with the cube (see figure).  Each ball intersects the cube only in a sector of $1/2^n$ of the ball, and there are $2^n$ vertices, so the total volume of the balls' intersections is just the volume of one ball.  Thus there is the same volume in a neighborhood of the vertices as there is in a neighborhood of the center of the cube (or any other interior point)!
