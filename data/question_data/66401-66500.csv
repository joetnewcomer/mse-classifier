1,Combinatorics questions about binary strings of length $10$,Combinatorics questions about binary strings of length,10,"I'm just running through my midterm review.. I'm usually pretty bad at applying simple combinatorics to word problems.. So I just was wondering if anyone could confirm the following answers. We're dealing with binary strings of length 10. a) How many binary strings of length 10 have at least three 0's? So, this is equal to the total number of binary strings of length 10 minus the number of binary strings of length 10 with zero, one, and two 0's. zero 0's: There is only 1 string like this: 1111111111 one 0: There are ten places to place the one 0, and thus there are ten of such cases two 0's: There are ten places to place the first 0 and nine places to place the second 0.  However, there is an overlap so we divide by $2!$. b)How many binary strings of length 10 have an even number of 1's? So here I just applied the method I used for the number of strings with two 0's. zero 1's: 1 string two 1's: $\dfrac{10*9}{2!}$ four 1's: $\dfrac{10*9*8*7}{4!}$ six 1's: $\dfrac{10*9*8*7*6*5}{6!}$ eight 1's: $\dfrac{10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3}{8!}$ ten 1's: $\dfrac{10!}{10!}$ So if you sum all of that up, you get 512 strings which makes sense because $2^{10} = 1024$.. c) The number of binary strings of length 10 with alternating 0's and 1's This one's really easy... There are only two options: $1010..$ and $0101..$ d) Four consecutive 0's Here, there are $7$ places to put the block of zeros, then $2$ ways to fill in each remaining space, for a total of $7 * 2^6$ possible strings.

2,Counting multidimensional structures (Chomp game states),Counting multidimensional structures (Chomp game states),,"The game Chomp is described as follows on Wikipedia : Chomp is a 2-player game of strategy played on a rectangular   ""chocolate bar"" made up of smaller square blocks (rectangular cells).   The players take it in turns to choose one block and ""eat it"" (remove   from the board), together with those that are below it and to its   right. The top left block is ""poisoned"" and the player who eats this   loses. I am interested in counting the number of possible game states, including the initial game state where all the chocolate is left, and the end-game state where all the chocolate is gone. $2$-dimensions In the 2-dimensional case, this is possible using the following observation: We will visualise a game board as follows: $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline x & x & x & x\\ \hline x & x & x & x\\ \hline x & x & x & -\\ \hline -& - & - & -\\ \hline \end{array} $$ where $x$ denote the remaining blocks, and the $-$ corresponds to removed blocks. Any 2-dimensional game state, is characterised by the cells on the boundary of the remaining cells (the cells which are adjacent - either directly or diagonally - to a removed cell or the bottom or right side of the board). Here are some examples of game states, with boundary cells highlighted $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline x & x & x & {\bf x}\\ \hline x & x & {\bf x} & {\bf x}\\ \hline {\bf x} & {\bf x} & {\bf x} & -\\ \hline -& - & - & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline x & x & x & {\bf x}\\ \hline x & x & x & {\bf x}\\ \hline x & x & x & {\bf x}\\ \hline {\bf x} & {\bf x} & {\bf x} & {\bf x}\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline - & - & - & -\\ \hline - & - & - & -\\ \hline - & - & - & -\\ \hline - & - & - & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline x & {\bf x} & {\bf x} & -\\ \hline x & {\bf x} & - & -\\ \hline {\bf x} & {\bf x} & - & -\\ \hline {\bf x} & - & - & -\\ \hline \end{array} $$ In turn, such a boundary corresponds to a special walk on the grid graph constructed by letting each cell be a vertex, and by joining vertices corresponding to adjacent cells (note that the end-state corresponds to the empty walk). These walks start in the left-most column of the grid graph, and end in the top row of the grid graph. Using this bijection from game states to such walks, we compute the number of game states as follows: The number of game states in a 2-dimensional chomp-game with $n_1$ rows and $n_2$ columns is given by $$ 1 + \sum_{d_1 = 1}^{n_1} \sum_{d_2 = 1}^{n_2} \binom{d_1 + d_2 - 2}{d_1-1}. $$ which is based on the number of staircase walks . The plus one takes care of the end-game state. For example, plugging in $n_1=n_2=2$ gives us $$ 1 + \sum_{d_1 = 1}^{2} \sum_{d_2 = 1}^{2} \binom{d_1 + d_2 - 2}{d_1-1} = 1 + \binom{0}{0} +  \binom{1}{0} +  \binom{1}{1} +  \binom{2}{1} +  = 6 $$ which corresponds to the game states $$ \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline x & x\\ \hline x & x\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline x & x\\ \hline x & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline x & -\\ \hline x & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline x & x\\ \hline - & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline x & -\\ \hline - & -\\ \hline \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline - & -\\ \hline - & -\\ \hline \end{array} $$ $\geq 2$-dimensions Now my question is, how do we count the number of game states for chomp games with dimension $\geq 2$?

I'm having difficulty following some of the combinatorial elements. Let $G$ be a finite group containing exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions.

Likewise for the choices of $y$. On the other hand, I know that if the product $uv$ of two involutions $u$ and $v$ has odd order, then $u$ and $v$ are conjugate.

If $4$ of the $12$ points are to be chosen at random, what is the probability that a quadrilateral having the $4$ points chosen as vertices will be trapezium ( Trapezium is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides)? My attempts : We choose $2$ points as a vertices. We have $\binom{12}{2}=66$ ways to choose the vertice. Let us label the vertices as vertices $1$ . In the remaining $10$ points, we need to choose $2$ of the points to form a vertex parallel to vertices $1$ . For every vertices $1$ , we have $5$ vertices formed by the remaining $10$ points that parallel to the vertices $1$ . So the total number of ways to form a trapezium is $66\times5\div2=165$ as we double counted the two vertices we choose. But we also double counted the total number of ways having $4$ points chosen as vertices will be a rectangle . We can still choose a vertices from $12$ equally spaced points on the circumference. We can form $\binom{12}{2}=66$ vertices by the points. In this $66$ vertices , $6$ of the vertices(the $6$ of the vertices are all the axis of symmetry of the regular dodecagon) can’t form a rectangle. For every of the remaining $60$ vertices , we have another $1$ vertices formed by the remaining $10$ points that parallel and equal to the previous vertices we choose. We counted four times the total number of ways ( two times for the two vertices we chose, and the remaining two times for the remaining two vertices was formed) having $4$ points chosen as vertices will be a rectangle . So we need to divide $4$ and we get the answer $15$ ( $60\div4=15$ ). So the final answer is $$\frac{\text{P(four points form a trapezium)}}{\text{P(four points randomly chosen from the 12 points)}}=\frac{165-15}{\binom{12}{4}}=\frac{150}{495}=\frac{10}{33}$$ Is my approach correct?","This is a question from the APMOPS competition online paper last question : There are equally spaced point on the circumference.

44,Is there an underlying graph-theory representation of Sudoku solutions?,Is there an underlying graph-theory representation of Sudoku solutions?,,"I have been puzzling for some time about how a completed 9x9 Sudoku solution can be represented mathematically, and how that mathematical representation can be used to enumerate the different mathematically unique arrangements of the cells. I am only a high-school level mathematician, so my understanding of the subject area and its possible solutions may be a stretch, but nevertheless I would be interested in whether anyone has done work on this subject. I understand that a sudoku board can be considered as just a 2-d representation, for convenience, of an underlying graph, or maybe hypergraph, which more fundamentally represents the true structure, i.e. the relationships between the cells, of the board. However, a completed Sudoku board can be rearranged by swapping rows within each 3-row group, swapping columns within each 3-column group, swapping complete 3-row or 3-column groups around, rotating and mirroring the board, and even switching the numbers around, for example changing all the 6 cells to 3 and 3 cells to 6. What I am looking for is a representation of the underlying canonical ""shape"" of the board which is the same regardless of the transformations. All the transformations are simply presentational changes in the way the underlying unique shape is projected onto a 2-d surface. The problems I am struggling with are: a) How can I determine the canonical underlying mathematical definition, i.e. the ""shape"", of any given completed Sudoku board? b) How many unique Sudoku ""shapes"" are there? It seems that most articles or papers that discuss Sudoku look at the maths of the puzzle process, i.e. setting and solving, rather than the maths of the underlying solution. In this case, puzzles that actually represent the same underlying shape (i.e. one puzzle can be rearranged, or ""transformed"", to the other) are considered as distinct puzzles - not as two instances of the same puzzle. In respect of problem a), I have made some attempts at defining the rules for transforming a completed board into its underlying canonical mathematical form. I have tried developing an algorithm that classifies the relative positioning of cells of the same number and different numbers across the board (ignoring the number itself) so that there is a representation of  the ""shape"" (as a graph/network) that does not change even if the 2-d board is rearranged, e.g. by swapping rows and columns or rotating/flipping the board. I have not succeeded (yet). I guess combinatorics will come into the answer to b), but I have not even attempted that. What interests me here is that maybe there are relatively few underlying unique shapes and, if so, perhaps it would be fun to apply the process identified in a) to thousands or millions of completed grids to see how many of their underlying canonical shapes can actually be found. Also, maybe there are classes of different types or families of shape that have different mathematical or topological properties.

So, basically I could solve this by dividing it into cases as $(1,1,4)$ for when A gets 1 prize, B gets 1, and C gets 4 prizes, $(1,2,3)$ and $(2,2,2)$ and then calculated distributions in each case as well as taking into account the unique arrangements, as $(1,1,4)$ and $(1,4,1)$ are 2 different cases.

So, $3^6 -1$ Now let any one child get no prize and so 6 prizes can be distributed among 2 children in 2^6 ways. And we can select the child getting 0 prize in 3 ways. So, $$3^6-1-3(2^6)$$ However $3 * 2^6$ ways has 3 cases of $(0,0,0)$ which we had already excluded earlier, so we should add 3 now. $$3^6 -3(2^6) + 2$$ Also $3 * 2^6$ has 2 cases each of $(0,0,1)$ , $(1,0,0)$ , $(0,1,0)$ , so by following earlier reasoning we must add 3 to the expression as these cases are getting subtracted twice.

One possible solution is on the right. The aim is to place a valid word in each row that is the same as the one preceding it except for one letter change. There are four words to fill in, so there are five letter changes between the start and end: at least one  additional letter must be introduced (the L in line 3 of my example.) I got to wondering how many possible solutions a given puzzle may have. Puzzles vary in this because of the restriction that all words must be valid, but if we use numbers instead of words that restriction disappears. Furthermore, in the word problem all eight of the given letters are different, but in my digital version I want to allow duplicates. So I am attempting to calculate the number of ways that one $4$ -digit number may be changed into another, changing one digit at a time, such that all the $4$ -digit numbers are different, and five changes are made (so over six lines). Leading $0$ 's and duplicate digits are allowed. First case and a solution The easiest case to enumerate is where none of the digits in the final row are in the same position in the starting row (e.g. changing $1234$ into $5678$ or changing $1234$ into $4321$ ). Four of the five digit changes are ""fixed"" in that once a digit is placed in its correct position in the final row it can't be changed. The other change I call ""free"" in that it doesn't appear in that position in the final row, so any valid digit will do. Here is an example using numbers: \begin{array}{ll} 1234 & \text{ Start}\\ \hline 5234 & 5 \text{ is fixed}\\ 5634 & 6 \text{ is fixed}\\ 5639 & 9 \text{ is free}\\ 5679 & 7 \text{ is fixed}\\ \hline 5678 & 8 \text{ is fixed} \end{array} The four fixed digits can appear in any order, and so these lines contribute a factor of $4!$ to the total. Which leaves the line containing the free digit. The number of possibilities for this line depends on when it is introduced: as more of the fixed digits are put in position, there are fewer places for the free digit to go. Although all 10 digits are theoretically available, each line must be different to the one(s) preceding it (i.e. one digit must change each time), and the free digit must not be the same as the digit in the same position in the final line (or it wouldn't be free). So only eight digits are available. The possibilities of what can happen where are: \begin{array}{clcc} \text{Line}^1 & \text{Positions available} & \text{Possible lines}\\ \hline 2 & 4 & 32\\ 3 & 3 & 24\\ 4 & 2 & 16\\ 5 & 1 & \phantom{0}8 \end{array} $^1$ i.e. the line in which the free digit is introduced. So the line containing the free digit can appear in $32+24+16+8 = 80$ ways. Putting all this together, there are $24 \cdot 80 = 1920$ possible ways to complete each game. Other cases The next case is where one of the target digits is already in position, e.g. changing $1234$ into $1678$ . There are two cases here: i) force the target digit already in position to change. Another line then has to be used up to change it back again, so there is room for only one free digit. ii) do not change the target digit already in position. The problem becomes one of changing the other three digits over five lines, so two free digits are required. There are $\binom42 = 6$ ways in which they can be introduced (the final change must be fixed, not free). This gives six sub-cases of varying complexity. As above, the number of possibilities depends on when the free digits come in. I shan't take up time and space describing them here. The remaining cases (changing $1234$ into $1278$ (up to three free digits) and changing $1234$ into $1238$ (up to four free digits)) have increasing complexity. My question Is there an easier way to enumerate all this? Maybe consider the whole problem in one go rather than considering all these cases? Or a different way to divide into cases that makes for easier computation?","Introduction On the left is an example of a Word Ladder puzzle, invented (allegedly) by Lewis Carroll. One possible solution is on the right. The aim is to place a valid word in each row that is the same as the one preceding it except for one letter change. There are four words to fill in, so there are five letter changes between the start and end: at least one  additional letter must be introduced (the L in line 3 of my example.) I got to wondering how many possible solutions a given puzzle may have. Puzzles vary in this because of the restriction that all words must be valid, but if we use numbers instead of words that restriction disappears. Furthermore, in the word problem all eight of the given letters are different, but in my digital version I want to allow duplicates. So I am attempting to calculate the number of ways that one -digit number may be changed into another, changing one digit at a time, such that all the -digit numbers are different, and five changes are made (so over six lines). Leading 's and duplicate digits are allowed. First case and a solution The easiest case to enumerate is where none of the digits in the final row are in the same position in the starting row (e.g. changing into or changing into ). Four of the five digit changes are ""fixed"" in that once a digit is placed in its correct position in the final row it can't be changed. The other change I call ""free"" in that it doesn't appear in that position in the final row, so any valid digit will do. Here is an example using numbers: The four fixed digits can appear in any order, and so these lines contribute a factor of to the total. Which leaves the line containing the free digit. The number of possibilities for this line depends on when it is introduced: as more of the fixed digits are put in position, there are fewer places for the free digit to go. Although all 10 digits are theoretically available, each line must be different to the one(s) preceding it (i.e. one digit must change each time), and the free digit must not be the same as the digit in the same position in the final line (or it wouldn't be free). So only eight digits are available. The possibilities of what can happen where are: i.e. the line in which the free digit is introduced. So the line containing the free digit can appear in ways. Putting all this together, there are possible ways to complete each game. Other cases The next case is where one of the target digits is already in position, e.g. changing into . There are two cases here: i) force the target digit already in position to change. Another line then has to be used up to change it back again, so there is room for only one free digit. ii) do not change the target digit already in position. The problem becomes one of changing the other three digits over five lines, so two free digits are required. There are ways in which they can be introduced (the final change must be fixed, not free). This gives six sub-cases of varying complexity. As above, the number of possibilities depends on when the free digits come in. I shan't take up time and space describing them here. The remaining cases (changing into (up to three free digits) and changing into (up to four free digits)) have increasing complexity. My question Is there an easier way to enumerate all this? Maybe consider the whole problem in one go rather than considering all these cases? Or a different way to divide into cases that makes for easier computation?","

60,Finding the greatest sum of 10 integers with a given set of constraints.,Finding the greatest sum of 10 integers with a given set of constraints.,,"This is a problem that comes up often in my job. Not as transparently as this (it's not a heavily-math focused job, haha), but at a fundamental level it does, and I was wondering if it can be generalised in any way. I'm not a very math-savvy person, so please bear with my phrasing of this like a textbook question: You have a linear sequence of 10 spaces labelled A through J. Into each space you may place 1 and only 1 counter. You have 4 types of counter: four counters marked ""2"", three counters marked ""3"", two counters marked ""4"", and two counters marked ""5"". You may place counters into each space as you see fit, as long as you respect the following rule: A counter marked with $x$ cannot be placed within $x$ spaces of another counter marked with $x$ . For example, if a ""2"" counter is placed in space A, no ""2"" counters can be placed in spaces B or C. If a ""2"" counter is placed in space C, no ""2"" counters can be placed in spaces A, B, D, or E. Finally, you are not required to place a counter in every space. Given the above constraints, what is the greatest possible value for the sum of the numbers marked on the counters placed in spaces A through J? Like I said, the problem in practice is not usually that transparent, so I'm more interested in whether the answer can be generalised in some way (like into a formula of some kind), or if it's too complex for that. Thank you for your time, and apologies in advance if I've mis-tagged this question.","This is a problem that comes up often in my job.

61,Proving rank deficiency of a matrix whose elements are given by trigonometric functions,Proving rank deficiency of a matrix whose elements are given by trigonometric functions,,"I want to show that a specific $(N^2+1)\times 3N$ matrix ( $N\geq 3$ ) is rank deficient, specifically that it has rank $3N-1$ . Ideally, I would like to show that this is the case for all $N\geq 3$ but I'm also very happy if I can show the case $N=3$ . Below is the matrix for $N=3$ . Each element is either $0$ , $1$ or a trigonometric function in two out of $2N+1$ variables ( $x_i, y_i, z$ ; these can be chosen at random with $z\neq 2\pi m$ for $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ ). A formal definition of the matrix is given below. In addition, I provide the Python code which generates this matrix; this code also verifies the rank deficiency numerically. I would like to know if there exist any techniques for showing rank deficiency which I could use to approach this problem. This is what I tried so far: I removed any factors that are constants per column in order to arrive at a simpler version of the column space; the matrix below is the most simple version I could come up with after removing a bunch of such factors. I asked Mathematica to compute the rank of the $N=3$ matrix, however, it returned $9$ as an answer, so most likely it failed the constant problem . I also asked Mathematica to compute the singular values (so I could check them myself) but it didn't finish the computation within a reasonable amount of time. I asked SymPy to compute the rank, the singular values, the QR decomposition and the nullspace of the $N=3$ matrix but it didn't finish the computation within a reasonable amount of time for either task. For $N=3$ , the reduced matrix by removing the first row must have rank no larger than the original matrix. Since this reduced matrix happens to be a square matrix, I can compute the determinant. After doing trigonometric expansion of all the involved terms, the problem of the determinant being zero should be decidable (albeit computationally expensive). However, then it remains to show that the first row $[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]$ can be constructed from a linear combination of all the remaining rows. This amounts to solving $cM = \mathrm{row}_1$ which again might be too difficult to compute (as it involves division by $\sin,\cos$ terms). When looking at the $N^2\times N$ matrix that consists of all the column factors stacked row-wise, there are always exactly $3N-2$ non-duplicated rows in that matrix (see below for $N=3$ and $N=4$ examples). In fact, for each specific combination of all three factors $\{-1,0,1\}$ , there are always two such rows in this factor matrix. Each other combination of only two factors occurs only once. So I thought about using the $3N-2$ row vectors from the actual matrix that correspond to the non-duplicated rows in the factor matrix, together with the $[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]$ row vector and show that all other row vectors can be constructed from linear combinations of these, but I couldn't come up with a solution (the problem is that every row in the actual matrix contains a different combination of $x_i,y_j$ ). I tried to find the coefficients of the nullspace ""by hand"" (or, rather, by being creative), however, I couldn't come up with a solution. The Harmonic Addition Theorem seemed promising and it helped me to get an expression for the sum of trigonometric terms per row, however, I couldn't figure out how to show that these expressions can be made zero for all of the rows by an appropriate choice for the linear coefficients (as these coefficients are contained inside the $\tan(\delta) = \dots$ expressions). And that's all the techniques/approaches that I am aware of. Thus, I would be glad if someone could point me in the right direction for approaching this problem. Formal definition of the matrix Let $x_i,y_i,z \in \mathbb{R}$ with $0\leq i < N$ and $z \neq 2\pi m$ ( $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ ) and $N\geq 3$ . Let $F_{kl}$ be a matrix of shape $N^2\times N$ . Assume the row ordering given by $k = iN+j$ (where $i,j$ refer to the symbols $x,y$ ). Then $F_{kl}$ is defined in the following way: $$ F_{kl} = \begin{cases} -1 & \; , \quad 0           &\leq l < \min(i,j+1) \\  0 & \; , \quad \min(i,j+1) &\leq l < \max(i,j+1) \\ +1 & \; , \quad \max(i,j+1) &\leq l < N \\ \end{cases} $$ Further let $M_{kl}^{(1)}, M_{kl}^{(2)}, M_{kl}^{(3)}$ be matrices of shape $N^2\times N$ ; again $k = iN+j$ . $$ \begin{aligned} M_{kl}^{(1)} &= \cos\left(x_i + y_j + F_{kl}z\right)\\ M_{kl}^{(2)} &= \sin\left(x_i + y_j + F_{kl}z\right)\\ M_{kl}^{(3)} &= \left(1-|F_{kl}|\right)\cdot \begin{cases} \sin\left(x_i - y_j + \frac{z}{2}\right) & \; , \quad i \leq j\\ \sin\left(y_j - x_i + \frac{z}{2}\right) & \; , \quad i > j\\ \end{cases}\\ \end{aligned} $$ Then the matrix $M$ of interest is given by a column stack of the individual matrices $M_{kl}^{(1)},M_{kl}^{(2)},M_{kl}^{(3)}$ , augmented by an additional row $[0,\dots,0,0\dots,0,1\dots,1]$ : $$ M = \begin{bmatrix} & & & & & & & & \\ & M^{(1)} & & & M^{(2)} & & & M^{(3)} & \\ & & & & & & & & \\ 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & \dots & 1 \\ \end{bmatrix} $$ Objectives Conjecture 1: $M$ is rank deficient.

Then $\sum_{j=1}^{n} f(\frac{n}{j})$ should count the same but with more detail. For $j = 1$ we have $f(n)$ which counts all the ordered pairs but with the restriction that they have to be coprime. We can partition the set of all ordered pairs into those that are coprime and those that are not.

Talking in terms of group actions the set the group acts on is the set of colourings and the group is the set of isometries of the cube. The 24 coulourings that are rotaitonally equivalent form an orbit of a given colouring and the group of isometries acting on the cube. One can use Burnside's lemma to find the number of orbits. But I was wondering if the Orbit-Stabilizer-Theorem also applied. The theorem states that $\mid G \mid$ (= number of isometries of the cube = $48$ ) is equal to the stabilizer of a given element (=colouring) times the size of its orbit (= $24$ ). Now the problem I have is that $\frac{48}{24}$ equals two and not $30$ as it should.  Basically, using this I have calcualted that the stabilizers have size $2$ but I think that's wrong too because obviously the only isometry that leaves a given side alone is the identity.

We were given a 3x3 square made of unit squares, and we wanted to paint all the squares. We had 3 sets of paint, red, blue, and green.

Additionally, there's only enough paint of each color to color 3 unit squares, and all the paint has to be used. The goal of the exercise was to find the total amount of distinct possible ways such that no two unit squares that share an edge (that is to say they are next to each other vertically or horizontally, having same color across a diagonal is fine). I've started by trying to take a look at each possible arrangement of the bottom 3 unit squares, but I can't seem to find a pattern between it. Is there a better way than continuing by brute force?

This formula resembles Pascal's rule $\binom{n}k=\binom{n}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ and indeed, it can be proven by rearranging sums and applying Pascal's rule. But we can also view $C_n(k)$ as the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,k\}$ of size $\leq n$ . Then the formula $C_n(k)=C_n(k-1)+C_{n-1}(k-1)$ admits essentially the same combinatorial proof as Pascal's rule, where we break up $C_n(k)$ depending on whether or not the subset contains $k$ . To better understand the relationship between $C_n(k)$ and hyperplane cutting, I wonder if there is a direct proof (i.e. not using induction) of the above-mentioned result?
