For any $x$ in the ring $F[t,t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$), $x$ is a power of $t$ if and only if $x$ divides $1$ and $t-1$ divides $x-1$ (the divisibilities are meant, of course, in $F[t, t^{-1}]$). Lemma 2. $t^n-1$ divides $t^m-1$ in $F[t, t^{-1}]$ ($F[t,t^{-1}]$: the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Lemma 3.

THEOREM. Assume that $F$ has characteristic $p>2$. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. PROOF. We think of the powers of $t$ as representing the integers; thus, $t^n$ represents the integer $n$. By Lemma $1$, the set of powers of $t$ is existentially definable.

11,Do we have a proof of the infiniteness?,Do we have a proof of the infiniteness?,,"Crossposted on Mathoverflow. Given a natural number $a$, are there infinitely many natural numbers not of the form $anm \pm m \pm n$, $n, m$ positive natural? I give a proof that for $a=6$ the question is equivalent to the twin prime conjecture so it is known that we don't have any proof. But what about other values of $a$? There are infinitely many twin primes if and only if there are infinitely many natural numbers that are not of the form $6nm \pm n \pm m$. Proof: Every number that is not a multiple of $2$ or $3$ is of the form $6N\pm 1$. So the only pairs that are not divisible by $2$ or $3$ are $(6N-1,6N+1)$ for any $N$. Now are there infinitely many such prime pairs (twin primes)? If the number $6N-1$ is prime it should not be written as a product of some numbers $6n+1,6m-1$ for any $n,m > 0$. So $(6n+1)(6m-1)=6(6nm-n+m)-1$, which means that $N$ should not be of the form $6nm-n+m$ for any $n,m>0$. Similarly, if $6N+1$ is a prime it should not be a product of some numbers $(6n-1)(6m-1) =6(6nm-n-m)+1$, or $(6n+1)(6m+1) =6(6nm+n+m)+1$.

Proof: Every number that is not a multiple of $2$ or $3$ is of the form $6N\pm 1$. So the only pairs that are not divisible by $2$ or $3$ are $(6N-1,6N+1)$ for any $N$. Now are there infinitely many such prime pairs (twin primes)? If the number $6N-1$ is prime it should not be written as a product of some numbers $6n+1,6m-1$ for any $n,m > 0$. So $(6n+1)(6m-1)=6(6nm-n+m)-1$, which means that $N$ should not be of the form $6nm-n+m$ for any $n,m>0$. Similarly, if $6N+1$ is a prime it should not be a product of some numbers $(6n-1)(6m-1) =6(6nm-n-m)+1$, or $(6n+1)(6m+1) =6(6nm+n+m)+1$. Which means that we have a prime couple of the form $(6N-1,6N+1)$ if and only if $N$ is not of the form $6nm \pm n \pm m$ for any $n,m$.",,['number-theory']

24,"$F[t]$ has undecidable positive existential theory in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$",has undecidable positive existential theory in the language,"F[t] \{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}","Consider the ring $F[t, t^{-1}]$ (the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$). Theorem 1. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is unecidable. Theorem 2. Assume that $F$ has characteristic $p>2$. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. We have that even the positive existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. Now we give a Lemma that, together with the preceding results, allows us to conclude the undecidability of the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Lemma. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then the solutions of $$X^2-(t^2-1)Y^2=1$$ with $X$ and $Y$ in $F[t]$ are given by $$(X, Y)=(\pm x_n, y_n)$$ where $$x_n+\sqrt{t^2-1}y_n=(t+\sqrt{t^2-1})^n$$ fr $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Theorem 3. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then $F[t]$ has undecidable positive existential theory in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Proof. Write $u=t+\sqrt{t^2-1}$. Then $u^{-1}=t-\sqrt{t^2-1}$ and $F[u, u^{-1}]=F[t, \sqrt{t^2-1}]$. We interpret the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in $F[t]$ in the following way: an element $x$ of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is represented as a pair $x=(a, b)$ with $a, b$ in $F[t]$ being the components of $x$ with repsect to the base $\{u, u^{-1}\}$ considering $F[u, u^{-1}]$ as a module over $F[t]$; addition and multiplication of elements of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is defined accordingly. So, we see that the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is interpretable in $F[t]$ with only one problem: we do not have constants for $u$ and $u^{-1}$ but only for $\frac{u+u^{-1}}{2}=t$. So, the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ is undecidable provided that the theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is undecidable in the language $\{0, 1, u+u^{-1}/2, +, \cdot\}$. It is only a matter of routine checking to see that our undecidability result for $F[u, u^{-1}]$ holds true in this language as well: simply substitute $v=u-t$, write all equations involved in the form $fv=g$, where $f$ and $g$ have coefficients in $F[t]$ (the quantity $v^2$, wherever it appears, is replaced by $t^2-1$ which is in $F[t]$) and substitute the equations of this last form by the corresponding equations $f^2(t^2-1)=g^2$. Of course, it is necessary to check that the new solutions that come onto the scene through the squaring do not do any harm to the stated equivalences. Hence, the theorem follows. $$$$ How do we use the Lemma at the proof of Theorem $3$ ? How is it useful? $$$$ EDIT: That's how I understood the whole proof of Theorem $3$ : We know that the existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, u\}$ is undecidable. We want to reduce the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, u\}$ to the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ to show that this theory is also undecidable. To do that we do the following: We suppose that the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is decidable. We set $u=t+\sqrt{t^2-1}$. So, we have that $u^{-1}=t-\sqrt{t^2-1}$. So, we have $F[u, u^{-1}]=F[t, \sqrt{t^2-1}]$. So, $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is an extension of $F[t]$. Each element $x$ of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ can be written as followed: $x=a+b\sqrt{t^2-1}$, where $a,b \in F[t]$. So, the mapping of the reduction is $x \mapsto (a,b)$. $+ \ \ : \ \  $ $$x_1+x_2=a_1+b_1\sqrt{t^2-1}+a_2+b_2\sqrt{t^2-1}=(a_1+a_2)+(b_1+b_2)\sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2)$$ $\cdot  \ \ : \ \  $ $$x_1\cdot x_2=(a_1+b_1\sqrt{t^2-1})(a_2+b_2\sqrt{t^2-1})=a_1 \cdot a_2+a_1 \cdot b_2 \sqrt{t^2-1}+a_2 \cdot b_1\sqrt{t^2-1}+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1)=(a_1 \cdot a_2+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1))+(a_1 \cdot b_2+a_2 \cdot b_1)\sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (a_1 \cdot a_2+b_1 \cdot b_2 (t^2-1), a_1 \cdot b_2+a_2 \cdot b_1)$$  $0  \ \ : \ \  $ $$0=0+0 \sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (0,0)$$  $1 \ \  :  \ \ $ $$1=1+0 \sqrt{t^2-1} \mapsto (1,0)$$ $u \ \ : \ \  $ $u \mapsto u-t=:v$. We write all the equations in the form $fv=g$ where $f,g \in F[t]$ and squaring these equations we get $f^2v^2=g^2 \Rightarrow f^2(t^2-1)=g^2$, so all these equations are in $F[t]$, where $t=(u+u^{-1})/2$. So we can convert the algorithm that answers to positive existential questions of $F[t]$ to an algorithm that answers to existential questions of $F[u, u^{-1}]$. Since the second theory is undecidable, we get aa contradiction. So the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ is undecidable. $$$$ Is this correct?","Consider the ring $F[t, t^{-1}]$ (the polynomials in $t$ and $t^{-1}$ with coefficients in the field $F$). Theorem 1. Assume that the characteristic of $F$ is zero. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$ is unecidable. Theorem 2. Assume that $F$ has characteristic $p>2$. Then the existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. We have that even the positive existential theory of $F[t, t^{-1}]$ is undecidable. Now we give a Lemma that, together with the preceding results, allows us to conclude the undecidability of the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Lemma. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then the solutions of $$X^2-(t^2-1)Y^2=1$$ with $X$ and $Y$ in $F[t]$ are given by $$(X, Y)=(\pm x_n, y_n)$$ where $$x_n+\sqrt{t^2-1}y_n=(t+\sqrt{t^2-1})^n$$ fr $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}$. Theorem 3. If the characteristic of $F$ is other than $2$, then $F[t]$ has undecidable positive existential theory in the language $\{+, \cdot , 0, 1, t\}$. Proof. Write $u=t+\sqrt{t^2-1}$. Then $u^{-1}=t-\sqrt{t^2-1}$ and $F[u, u^{-1}]=F[t, \sqrt{t^2-1}]$. We interpret the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ in $F[t]$ in the following way: an element $x$ of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is represented as a pair $x=(a, b)$ with $a, b$ in $F[t]$ being the components of $x$ with repsect to the base $\{u, u^{-1}\}$ considering $F[u, u^{-1}]$ as a module over $F[t]$; addition and multiplication of elements of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is defined accordingly. So, we see that the positive existential theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is interpretable in $F[t]$ with only one problem: we do not have constants for $u$ and $u^{-1}$ but only for $\frac{u+u^{-1}}{2}=t$. So, the positive existential theory of $F[t]$ is undecidable provided that the theory of $F[u, u^{-1}]$ is undecidable in the language $\{0, 1, u+u^{-1}/2, +, \cdot\}$.

I'm having a hard time understanding remainders in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ . I'm gonna write my solution to the problem above just to give some context, but you can skip this part and read the question below if you want. We start by noticing that $N(13+2i) = 173$ , which is a prime number. Therefore, $13+2i$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ . This allows us to quickly calculate the number of elements of the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{Z}[i]/(13+2i))^{\times}$ , namely $N(13+2i) - 1 = 172$ . By Lagrange's Theorem, since $1-3i$ and $13+2i$ are coprime, $$(1-3i)^{11\cdot 172} \equiv 1\mod(13+2i).$$ We now reduced the problem to finding $(1-3i)^{117} \mod (13+2i)$ . Note that $117 = 3^2\cdot 13$ , so by a tedious but direct calculation (once we figure out $(1-3i)^{3^2}$ modulo $13+2i$ we get a nice expression, so the $13$ th power is relatively straightforward to compute), we arrive at $6-2i$ . Question: Remainders in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ are not uniquely determined and, from my understanding, there are $4$ possible choices. It is not difficult to find different remainders when we are working with small numbers and can test various quotients. In this case, however, how would I determine the other possible choices? Are they somehow related? For instance, when I was calculating $(1-3i)^{3} = -26+18i$ , I found that $$(1-3i)^{3} = (-2+i)(13+2i) + (2+9i) = (-1+2i)(13+2i) + (-9-6i).$$ The remainders above have norms $N(2+9i) = 85$ and $N(-9-6i) = 117$ .

Counting $1$ as prime, the video shows a prime number growing up to $23$ by absorbing smaller primes during the first verse and chorus. In the second verse, swarms of $23$s and $53$s feed to form all the remaining two-digit primes from $29$ through $89$. During the final chorus, these primes then join together to form the primes $97, 131, 331, 281, 251$, and finally $863$.

68,Homological degrees of polynomials,Homological degrees of polynomials,,"Given a continuous map $f:S^n \to S^n$ , the homological degree of $f$ is defined to be the integer $\deg f_*$ such that $f_*(\alpha)=(\deg f_*)\alpha$ for any $\alpha \in H_n(S^n) \approx \mathbb{Z}$ . Exercise 2.2.8 in Hatcher's text asks the reader to consider a complex polynomial $p:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ . If this polynomial is nonconstant, then setting $p(\infty)=\infty$ gives an extension of $p$ to the one point compactification $p:\hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ . But $\hat{\mathbb C} \approx S^2$ , so one can consider the homological degree of $p$ . Turns out, this degree is equal to the degree of $p$ as a polynomial. $$\deg p_* = \deg p$$ If you do this whole thing over $\mathbb{R}$ instead, with one point compacitication $\hat{\mathbb R} \approx S^1$ , you don't get an analagous result. If $p(x)=a_nx^n + \dotsb +a_1x+a_0$ with $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ (and $a_n \not= 0$ ), then $$\deg p_* = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $n$ is even} \\ \operatorname{sign} a_n & \text{if $n$ is odd} \end{cases}$$ where $\operatorname{sign}$ is the $\pm 1$ sign of a nonzero real number.

I'm not even sure what ""quaternionic polynomial"" would mean since the quaternions aren't commutative, so expressions like $i \cdot q \cdot i$ and $(i^2)q=-q$ aren't equivalent.

72,On $\sup|\varphi^{-1}(n)|=+\infty$,On,\sup|\varphi^{-1}(n)|=+\infty,"I am trying to find an elementary proof of the following fact: Given some $N\geq 2$ , there are $N$ distinct integers $a_1,\ldots,a_N$ such that $\varphi(a_1)=\ldots=\varphi(a_N)$ with $\varphi$ being Euler's totient function. My original analytic proof goes as follows: If the number of solutions of $\varphi(x)=N$ were bounded, the series $$ \sum_{n\geq 2019}\frac{1}{\varphi(n)\log^2\varphi(n)}$$ would be convergent by comparison with $\sum_{n\geq n_0}\frac{1}{n \log^2 n}$ and condensation.
