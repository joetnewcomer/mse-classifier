3,Figuring out the underlying construction of a finite set,Figuring out the underlying construction of a finite set,,"Say you have a set A = { 1, 5, 10 } which when put through a function, produces the set: B = { 1, 5, 10, 6, 11, 15, 16 } That is, f(A) = B . I’m not sure the proper way to write the math for this, but the gist is that the output is made from all combinations of the input set, without duplicates. So, for example, here's how the elements are computed in the given example: B = { 1, 5, 10, 5+1, 10+1, 10+5, 10+5+1 } Each individual item in A is combined with the others so that the output is a list of unique values. That is, since 1+5 is the same as 5+1 , we only use that value once. A more concise way to describe the function is that it is the set of unique values from all nonempty combinations. The second (and most important) part to this is to go the other direction: given B , how do you figure out A ? Since I’m so new to this whole field, my question can be broken down into a few parts: What is the proper way to write the mathematics described above? What branch of mathematics would generally cover this problem? What would a solution to this specific problem look like?

I've explored a bit of of matrix algebra for this, and I've had some success with combining A and its transpose, taking the lower triangular matrix from the result, and combining this with the original values of A. I was hoping there would be a straight-forward way to reverse this process? (Possibly wishful thinking?)

4,Does anyone recognize the function from this picture?,Does anyone recognize the function from this picture?,,"I was playing with the exterior algebra, and stumbled on this interesting function from $\Bbb N^2 \to \Bbb N$ , which I'll call $f(x,y)$ . This is plotted from $1 \leq x,y \leq 100$ : In this picture, yellow values are higher, blue values are lower. So you can see the function is at its lowest when $x:y$ is closest to a simple ratio. For all $x$ , we have $f(x,x) = 2$ . However, for sufficiently large $x$ , we also have $f(x,x+1) = 3$ , $f(x,x+2)=4$ , etc, so this function is also in some sense measuring the distance to the nearest low-slope line. In comparison, here's the gcd(x,y) function: So you can see that while both functions feature prominent rational slopes, that the first one seems to be ""smoothed"" relative to the GCD, and also reaches minima at rational slopes rather than maxima . Is there some simple function that this resembles? Here is a CSV, if anyone wants to play with it, but due to the way I calculated this function, there may be some sporadic errors (though should be good for $x,y < 50$ or so: https://pastebin.com/raw/vEWAdBVM Just to say how I got this function: So for each $x,y$ pair, I generated the vector $(x,y,1)$ . Then, I wanted to find the ""shortest"" integer bivector that is the wedge product of $(x,y,1) \wedge v$ for some $v$ with integer coordinates. This is a plot of the norm of the resulting shortest bivector for each $(x,y)$ . I was using the $\ell_1$ norm to measure shortest for the thing I'm doing, but you get the same basic plot with the $\ell_2$ norm, as well as any $\ell_p$ norm. For each $(x,y)$ pair above, I ran a Monte Carlo search testing 10000 randomly generated bivectors and took the best one; after a few tries everything converged to the plot above. If you start with $(x,y,0)$ instead, you seem to get the basic GCD function instead, but $(x,y,1)$ gives the ""smooth nega-GCD"" pattern above.

I'm a longtime lurker, I have learned a lot from this site and I hope I can, even though I'm still a student, be of any help to others.  I have been working on the following exercise. Given: $ f(4) = a, f'(4) = b $ and  $$ \lim_{x\to 2} = {f(3x-2)-5 \over (x^2-4)} = 9$$ Find a and b. I already found the value of $a$ following this reasoning: $f(4)$ must be such a value that, when replaced in the given limit, yields zero; otherwise, the limit won't be $9$ but infinity. Under the assumption that I can factor the denominator easily -and simplify $(x-2)$ from $f(x)$ I found $a=f(4)=5$ and it coincides with the answer. I have, however, no reasonable clue of how to approach the $f'(4)=b$ part. All the information I seem to have is that the derivative is continuous, and that $(x-2)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$ .If it's derivative is continuous over Reals, then I infer that it is not a rational function.

Verify that your answer is correct. Does f have a right-inverse? Explain. Hi all, I need to asses whether this function is left and/or right invertible, and then prove it using proper proof language. I'm trying to follow the way my professor taught me, but I'm not really sure I understand what I'm doing. This is what I have: Theorem. $f$ is left-invertible. Proof. $f$ is left-invertible if there is some function $g:\Bbb Z \to \Bbb Z$ such that $g \circ f = id_{\Bbb Z}$. Consider $g(n)=\frac{n-1}{2}$. Then, $g \circ f(n) =\frac{2n+1-1}{2}=n=id_{\Bbb Z}$. Therefore, $f$ is left-invertible. Does that make any sense so far? Honestly, it doesn't  make any sense to me. The other problem is that using a similar strategy, I find that $f$ is also right-invertible. However, I know that not to be true, because $f(1)=3$ and $f(2)=5$, and thus there is no $n\in\Bbb Z$ such that $f(n)=4$ (aka, the function only spits out odd numbers if we restrict the domain to integer inputs). Therefore, it is not survective. If anyone can help me understand, perhaps from the beginning, how to properly do this problem and write it out, that would be amazing.

I'm trying to follow the way my professor taught me, but I'm not really sure I understand what I'm doing. This is what I have: Theorem. $f$ is left-invertible. Proof. $f$ is left-invertible if there is some function $g:\Bbb Z \to \Bbb Z$ such that $g \circ f = id_{\Bbb Z}$. Consider $g(n)=\frac{n-1}{2}$. Then, $g \circ f(n) =\frac{2n+1-1}{2}=n=id_{\Bbb Z}$. Therefore, $f$ is left-invertible. Does that make any sense so far? Honestly, it doesn't  make any sense to me. The other problem is that using a similar strategy, I find that $f$ is also right-invertible. However, I know that not to be true, because $f(1)=3$ and $f(2)=5$, and thus there is no $n\in\Bbb Z$ such that $f(n)=4$ (aka, the function only spits out odd numbers if we restrict the domain to integer inputs). Therefore, it is not survective. If anyone can help me understand, perhaps from the beginning, how to properly do this problem and write it out, that would be amazing.

Alternatively, if $x_2<x_1$, then $x_1=x_2+b$ for some $b\in \mathbb{R}^+$ Thus, $e^{x_2}+x<e^{x_2+b}+(x_2+b)\implies e^{x_2}+x_2<e^{x_2}*e^b+x_2+b\implies 1<e^b+\frac{x_2}{e^{x_1}}\implies 0<e^b+\frac{x_2}{e^{x_2}}-1$.

62,Tangents and roots to simultaneous equations.,Tangents and roots to simultaneous equations.,,"Straight line tangents I've been solving questions about linear tangents to curves and I noticed that when you create a simultaneous equation with a linear tangent you get a repeated root if it is tangent to a quadratic (and this is the only solution) and a repeated root (and one other root) when it is tangent to a cubic. { EDIT 1: Thinking about this a little more, I've realised that you can also have triple repeated roots where the line crosses the curve but has the same gradient as the curve where it crosses.} I was wondering if the number of repeated roots for a straight-line tangent to a curve is always two, and I thought about quartic curves and I think the roots you can get are: -2 equal roots that are real (tangent) and two complex roots -4 real roots: 2 are equal (tangent) and 2 different real rots (where the line crosses the curve) -2 pairs of equal roots (when the line is tangent to the curve at two points) Please correct me if I am wrong, but I think that with a straight-line tangent it always just has a double root at the point where it is tangent, and it may or may not have other roots... But I have also only thought about this using sketches of cubic and quartic curves. I was wondering if there was another way to see why this would be the case? Also, what would happen if you get a triple root? What does this mean? EDIT 2: Please scrap all of what I said above! I'm leaving it in just to show my thought process and general question, but after some more investigation with curves, my question has changed a bit... See below! So I now see that whenever there is a repeated root to an even power, the line is tangent to the curve. When there is a repeated root with an odd power, the line and curve meet and have the same gradient at this point, but they cross. So my questions now are: What is the significance of having a double root, as opposed to a quadruple root, when the line meets the curve (e.g. a curve defined by a quartic polynomial)? Does it have something to do with the second and third order derivatives too? What is the significance of complex roots to these equations? Specifically, what would be the difference between a tangent to a quartic where there is a single, real, repeated root to the power of four in the simultaneous equation as opposed to a single real root to the power of two, and a set of complex conjugate roots? My current idea of this is that with a single real root to the power of four, as you diverge away from the tangent point, the distance between the line and the curve keeps on growing, but each single complex conjugate root pair adds another dip of the curve towards line. If that is the case, then what is the significance of the real and imaginary components of the complex pair? I think the real component is the actual x value at which there is the closest PERPENDICULAR distance (I think! Please correct me on this one) between the line and the curve (i.e. the shortest distance following a normal to the tangent, as this is the actual closest distance) as opposed to the shortest vertical distance...) But then I am not sure what the significance of the imaginary part is. What difference does it make if, for instance, the conjugate pair is $-1/+-/2i$ as opposed to $-1/+-/7i$?? Tangents which are curves This I am not sure about at all. Does it follow the same principles that: Even power repeated root means tangent Odd power repeated root meant same gradient but crossing Extra real roots mean intersection Extra complex conjugate roots means shortening of distance between the two curves? Thinking about it now, when you solve the simultaneous equations and you set the two functions (i.e. y values) equal to each other, you literally create a distance function and you are trying to find where the distance is zero. Other than the fact that this means solutions to the equation show where the functions meet, whether tangent or intersection, i'm not sure what the significance of this is in my consideration. And it makes me a little more confused as to whether the shortest distance represented by a complex conjugate root pair is the vertical distance or the perpendicular distance. On the one hand, if it were the perpendicular distance, I am essentially imagining tilting the coordinate system so that the line (or lower power curve) is forming the x axis. The problem with it being the perpendicular distance though, is that this shortest distance follows a line which cuts the two curves (or line and curve) at different values of x. Which, then, is the solution that we find when solving the simultaneous equation? The vertical distance would solve this issue of the discrepancy of the x coordinate, and I suppose in that case the 'shortest actual distance' function would be more complicated... Unless, the 'base' line-i.e. x axis-- was formed by whichever function you subtract . E.g. if you have the curve f(x) and line g(x) and you form the distance function f(x)-g(x)=0, then maybe the distance line must be perpendicuular to the subtracted function, g(x), and not the first function, f(x), and the distance line must only be perpendicular to g(x) and the solution is the x value on f(x) that gives the shortest distance to any point on the line g(x)...

Prove that $$f^{-1}(U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n) = \bigcap_{i \in I} (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$$ where the $f_i$ are the coordinate functions of $f$ (Recall that the coordinate function $f_i : B \rightarrow A_i$ is defined by $f_i = \pi_i \circ f$ for each $i = \{1, \dotsc, n\}$, and the function $\pi_i: A_1 \times \cdots \times A_n \rightarrow A_i$ is a projection mapping). Proof First, let $b \in B$. If $b \in f^{-1}(U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n)$, then there exists an image $f(b) \in U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n$, so that $f(b) = (u_1, \dotsc, u_n)$ for some $u_i \in U_i$, where $i \in I$. Mapping $f(b)$ to an element in $U_i$ by $\pi_i$, we obtain the image $\pi_i(f(b)) = f_i(b) \in U_i$. Consequenlty, $b \in (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$ for each $i \in I$, so we can write $$b \in \bigcap_{i\in I} (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$$ from which we conclude that $$f^{-1}(U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n) \subseteq \, \bigcap_{i \in I} (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$$ Now suppose that $b\in B$. Assuming $m \in \bigcap_{i \in I} (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$, we deduce that, for every $i \in I$, $b\in (f_i)^{-1}(U_i)$. Hence, there exists $f_i(b) \in U_i)$ such that $f_i(b) = \pi_i(f(b))$. Define the preimage $(\pi_i \circ f)^{-1} = \{u \in U_1 \times \dotsc \times U_n \, : \, (\pi_i \circ f)(u) \in U_i\}$. Clearly, $\pi_i(f(b)) \in (\pi_i \circ f)^{-1}$, so $f(b) \in U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n$. Consequently, $b \in f^{-1}(U_1 \times \cdots \times U_n)$.

Some example for $f(n,k)$: $f(3,3)=1$ because only the $1+1+1$ produces $3$. $f(3,4)=3$ because $1+1+2$, $1+2+1$, $2+1+1$ are the only sums, which give $4$. Can anyone give me an explicit formula for $f$?","We have thrown with $n$ dice. The sum of resulting values is $k$.

98,Finding range of $f(x) = \sin^4 x\tan x + \cos^4 x\cot x$,Finding range of,f(x) = \sin^4 x\tan x + \cos^4 x\cot x,"I got to a certain step and couldn't continue. I can't fully understand the provided solution... $$ f(x) = {\sin^6x+\cos^6x \over \sin x \cos x} = {2-1.5\sin^2 2x \over \sin 2x}$$ Let$$ t=\sin2x, t \neq 0$$ $$ f(x) = g(t) = {2 \over t} - {3t \over 2}$$ I don't get the next part. Since $$\frac2t\ \text{and}\ -\frac{3t}2$$ are both decreasing on $$[-1,0)\cup(0,1]$$ The range of $g(t)$ is $$(-\infty , -0.5]\cup[0.5,+\infty)$$ which is the range of $f(x)$. Any explanation would be greatly appreciated.","I got to a certain step and couldn't continue.

99,Show that $S$ and $2^{S}$ are not equinumerous. (Not bijective?),Show that  and  are not equinumerous. (Not bijective?),S 2^{S},"I have tried to look for a problem the same as mine, but I have not been too lucky, or if I did I had trouble applying that solution to my problem. Any help would be appreciated. I know how to solve this problem, but I'm afraid it would someone ""cheap"" because it is just a fact I found. Let $S$ be any set.  Let $2^{S} =\{f\mid f\colon S\to\{0,1\}\}$. Then $S$ and $2^{S}$ are not equinumerous. Now, I believe the ""cheap"" way I found out how to do this is to use the fact that the there is a bijection between $2^{S}$ and $\mathcal{P}(S)$, but there is no bijection between a set and it's power set. I was given a hint to assume there is a bijection $f\colon S\to2^{S}$, and to copy the method used in Cantor's Theorem. I went through this theorem a few weeks ago. Also, I just looked at in my text and on Proofwiki, but I am still having trouble. Edit: I forgot to mention I am just taking an introductory logic class. The only thing we have done with Cantor's Theorem is prove that the powerset of integers is non enumerable.","I have tried to look for a problem the same as mine, but I have not been too lucky, or if I did I had trouble applying that solution to my problem.
