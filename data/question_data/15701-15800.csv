For example, if you were simply told to 'integrate $2x$'. Then we would normally write $$\int 2x\,\mathrm{d}x=x^2 + C$$ But where did the $\mathrm{d}x$ come from? In other words should it be 'integrate $2x\,\mathrm{d}x$'? When we integrate $2x$, is the integration variable $\mathrm{d}x$ already specified and is part of the integration operation?

My question is this: how does one evaluate the limit more directly without this seemingly redundant path of log on the exponent? In short, there's an approach at hand that is unsatisfactory, and I believe there are better ones. As a reference, below is the detailed steps of the circuitous solution outlined above: The definite integral evaluates to $$\frac1{b - a} \frac1{ 1 + \frac1n } \left[ a + (b-a)x \right]^{ 1 + \frac1n } \Bigg|_{0}^{1} = \frac{ b^{1 + \frac1n} - a^{1 + \frac1n} }{b - a} \frac1{ 1 + \frac1n }$$ Thus the whole expression becomes $$ \begin{align} &\lim_{n \to \infty} \left\{ \frac{ b^{1 + \frac1n} - a^{1 + \frac1n} }{b - a} \frac1{ 1 + \frac1n } \right\}^{n} \\ &= \frac1e \lim_{n \to \infty}  \left\{ 1 +  \frac{ b^{1 + \frac1n} - a^{1 + \frac1n}  - (b - a) }{b - a} \right\}^{n} \\ &= \frac1e \lim_{n \to \infty}  \left\{  1 +  \frac{ n \left( b^{1 + \frac1n} - b \right) - n \left(  	a^{1 + \frac1n} - a \right) }{ n (b - a) } \right\}^{n} \end{align} $$ all the limits exist so I'm just gonna keep writing in this non-rigorous way $$ \begin{align} &= \frac1e \lim_{n \to \infty}  \left\{  1 +  \frac1n \frac{ b \log b - a \log a }{ b - a } \right\}^{n} 	\\ &= \frac1e	\cdot e^{ \frac1{b-a} \left( b \log b - a \log a \right)} \\ &= \frac1e	\left( \frac{ b^b }{ a^a } \right)^{ \frac1{b-a}} \end{align}$$","Evaluate the limit for , Note that the exponent is inside the integration on the entire integrand and the exponent is outside on the definite integral.

I do not have use derivatives , so I decided to apply the definition of being a strictly increasing function, which should be: If we pick 2 numbers $a$ and $b$ from the domain of a function $f$, where $a < b$, then $f(a) < f(b)$. Now (if that is a correct definition), I have tried to apply it to my case: Let $a$, $b \in [-1, 1]$ and $a < b$. We want to show that $f(a) < f(b)$ or that $f(b) - f(a) > 0$.
