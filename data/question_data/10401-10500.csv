1,Is the fundamental theorem of calculus independent of ZF?,Is the fundamental theorem of calculus independent of ZF?,,"By the fundamental theorem of calculus I mean the following. Theorem: Let $B$ be a Banach space and $f : [a, b] \to B$ be a continuously differentiable function (this means that we can write $f(x + h) = f(x) + h f'(x) + o(|h|)$ for some continuous function $f' : [a, b] \to B$). Then $$\int_a^b f'(t) \, dt = f(b) - f(a).$$ (This integral can be defined in any reasonable way, e.g. one can use the Bochner integral or a Riemann sum.) This theorem can be proven from Hahn-Banach, which allows you to reduce to the case $B = \mathbb{R}$. However, Hahn-Banach is independent of ZF. Recently I tried to prove this theorem without Hahn-Banach and found that I couldn't do it. The standard proof in the case $B = \mathbb{R}$ relies on the mean value theorem, which is not applicable here. I can only prove it (I think) under stronger hypotheses, e.g. $f'$ continuously differentiable or Lipschitz. So I am curious whether this theorem is even true in the absence of Hahn-Banach. It is likely that I am just missing some nice argument involving uniform continuity, but if I'm not, that would be good to know.","By the fundamental theorem of calculus I mean the following.

2,Freaky dots in the complex plane,Freaky dots in the complex plane,,"Context: I recently saw user @David 's profile picture and description: ""My icon is the graph of the exponential sum $$\sum_{n=1}^{10620}e^{2\pi if(n)}$$ for $$f(n)=\frac{n}{20}+\frac{n^2}{9}+\frac{n^3}{59}\ ,$$ where the ""graph"" of an exponential sum means the sequence of partial sums, plotted in the complex plane, with successive points joined by straight line segments."" This intrigued me, so I decided to investigate. My findings and questions are below. Reproducing it in Desmos: (for those interested) I first decided to recreate the picture on Desmos. You can see it here (it will take a while to load). I created the image by defining $f(x)$ as it is defined above, then setting $$ x_2(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{x}\cos(2\pi f(k))\\ y_2(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{x}\sin(2\pi f(k))\\ p(x)=(x_2(x),y_2(x)) $$ So that $p(x)$ was essentially $\sum_{k=1}^{x}e^{2\pi i f(k)}$ . Then I defined the lists $$\begin{align} I_1&=[1,2,\dots,1000]\\ I_2&=[1001,1002,\dots,2000]\\ \dots &\dots\\ I_{10}&=[9001,9002,\dots,10000] \end{align}$$ Then entering $p(I_{1}),\ p(I_2),\ \text{etc.}$ gave a whole bunch ( $10000$ to be precise) of points. Then clicking the little gear symbol and then the colored circle next to each entry (on the left) I was able to connect the points $p(i)$ and $p(i+1)$ for any integer $1\leq i\leq 9999$ . I used the $10$ different lists instead of $1$ in order to keep Desmos from freaking out. My investigations: Also using Desmos and the same technique as described above, I decided to create the graphs corresponding to the functions $$H_n(x)=x+\frac{x^2}2+\frac{x^3}3+\dots+\frac{x^n}n\qquad (n>1)$$ i.e. I made the graphs for $$p(k)=\left(\sum_{r=1}^{k}\cos[2\pi H_n(r)],\sum_{r=1}^{k}\sin[2\pi H_n(r)]\right)$$ I made each sequence/graph have $700$ points (AKA I graphed $p([1,2,...,700])$ ) just to see if any irregular behavior started to occur. Here are the graphs for the first $6$ values of $n$ . $n=2$ : $n=3$ : $n=4$ : $n=5$ : I do not know how well you can see it, but the points are starting to move around a little. This is a picture of the $n=5$ graph when I zoomed in on one of the corners: $n=6$ : Needless to say, the wiggly effect has been amplified. For comparison, here's the $n=6$ graph of $p([1,2,...,31])$ : $n=7$ : Which is very far from well behaved. I think its 'supposed' to look something like the graph of $p([1,2,...,105])$ : Although even that has some drifty looking points. You can look at more of these graphs by changing the value of $n$ on this graph . Questions: At this point I'm fairly certain that the strange behavior (as demonstrated by the cases $n=5,6,7$ ) can be attributed to the accumulating numerical inaccuracies of Desmos. For example, Wolfram evaluates $$A=\sum_{r=1}^{700}\exp[2i\pi H_{7}(r)]$$ as $$A= -11.470821630307989891763598910658573978486117477630759175...\\ - 3.6768673678262517039383839969453158461799151084757854088... i$$ and provides a monstrous closed form . Whereas Desmos puts the sum at the wildly incorrect $$1.3535617164+9.88880050357i$$ I did the same sort of test with $B=\sum_{r=1}^{20}\exp[2i\pi H_5(r)]$ and Wolfram gave $$B=-6.3944653536668510841041628532095052345320229467766883302... \\+ 1.0127838162151622424794134150036094634983505690619992502... i$$ And Desmos gave $$-6.39446535424+1.01278381623i$$ Which is conclusive evidence that Desmos gets less accurate as $n$ and $x$ grow. That was the subject of my original question, but it seems to have been resolved by now. So my question is how do we find a general formula for $\pi_n\in\Bbb N$ such that $$\forall k\in\Bbb N,\quad f_n(k+\pi_n)=f_n(k)$$ where $$f_n(k)=\sum_{\ell=1}^{k}\exp[2i\pi H_n(\ell)]$$ I found the first few values: $$\pi_2=2\\ \pi_3=6\\ \pi_4=6\\ \pi_5=30\\ \pi_6=30$$ But there's got to be some other way to do this.

How can we prove it? Thoughts Well, I honestly does not have much thoughts on it but I think turning it into an integral or Euler sum is a possible pathway. Therefore, I turned it into an integral: $$\int_0^1\frac{54x^2-150x+59}{2x^3-6x^2+5x-2}\ln^4xdx\stackrel?=\ln^52-\frac83\pi^2\ln^32-\frac{97}{24}\pi^4\ln2-\frac{6417}{16}\zeta(5)$$ Further Question Can $\Re\Li_n(1+i)$ be simplified? Or at least can it be turned into a combination of $\Li(1/2)$ and some other simpler constants? (Assuming Multiple Zeta Values are simpler) Update Another numerical experiment suggests $$\Re\operatorname{Li}_6(1+i)\stackrel?=-\frac{5 \text{Li}_6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{64}+\frac{69 S}{512}+\frac{207 \zeta (3)^2}{4096}+\frac{2139 \zeta (5) \log (2)}{8192}+\frac{18779 \pi ^6}{30965760}-\frac{\log ^6(2)}{9216}+\frac{\pi ^2 \log ^4(2)}{2304}+\frac{97 \pi ^4 \log ^2(2)}{73728},$$ where $S=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{n-1}H_n}{n^5}$ . Further numerical experiments suggest that $$J_n=\int_0^1\left(\frac{1-x}{x^2-2 x+2}+\frac{5 x}{x^2-2}\right) \ln^nxdx$$ may be turned into the same form of the result of ""logarithm integral"", mentioned in the paper in the comment, containing $1−x,x,x+1$ only, of weight $n+1$ . If we can find a substitution that can directly convert it into ""log integral"", the whole question will be solved by evaluating this integral.

10,When is an elliptic integral expressible in terms of elementary functions?,When is an elliptic integral expressible in terms of elementary functions?,,"After seeing this recent question asking how to calculate the following integral $$ \int \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2) \sqrt{1 + x^4}} \, dx $$ and some of the comments that suggested that it was an elliptic integral, I tried reading a little bit on the Wikipedia article about elliptic integrals . It seems that the point is that most elliptic integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. The Wikipedia article defines an elliptic integral as an integral of the form $$\int R \left( x, \sqrt{ P(x) } \right ) \, dx$$ where $R(x, y)$ is a rational function and $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $3$ or $4$ with no repeated roots. Now, the article does mention in its introductory section that two exceptions in which the elliptic integrals can be expressed in terms of elementary functions are when the polynomial $P(x)$ has repeated roots or when the rational function $R(x, y)$ does not contain odd powers of $y$. In the example in question we have $P(x) = 1 + x^4$ and $$R(x, y) = \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2)y}$$ so certainly it does not correspond to the two exceptions mentioned before. Thus I have a couple of questions about this: 1) What are the conditions for an elliptic integral (as defined in the Wikipedia article) to be expressible in terms of elementary functions? More specifically, are the two above cited conditions the only exceptions or are there any others which may explain why the above integral is expressible in terms of elementary functions? 2) Depending on the answer to my first question, why is it that the above ""elliptic integral"" can be expressed in terms of elementary functions? Note: I'm not sure but I suppose that some conditions must be put on the rational function $R(x, y)$ so to avoid trivial cases, but I don't want to speculate. Thank you very much in advance.","After seeing this recent question asking how to calculate the following integral $$ \int \frac{1 + x^2}{(1 - x^2) \sqrt{1 + x^4}} \, dx $$ and some of the comments that suggested that it was an elliptic integral, I tried reading a little bit on the Wikipedia article about elliptic integrals .

28,Influence of small constant term on roots of polynomial,Influence of small constant term on roots of polynomial,,"Let $p(x)=a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0,\enspace a_i\in\mathbb{C}$ some polynomial. Suppose that $|a_0|$ is very small (compared to the other coefficients' magnitude). Is there any way the (complex) roots of $p(x)$ could be heavily affected by setting $a_0 = 0$ ? I think the answer could be no because the polynomial is continuous in the constant term and thus small changes in the constant term will affect the function only slightly. But does this hold true for the location of the roots? Why am I asking this? I try to incorporate a not selfwritten custom root finder into my Matlab-program but unfortunately in some rare cases one of its loops doesn't converge if the input vector's constant coefficient is of the magnitude $\approx 10^{-18}$ and then the algorithm crashes. However it does converge if I set the constant term to zero but I worry whether I could get wrong results. EDIT 1: Based on the answer by @Fixed Point, I could find a successor ( NAClab ) of the Matlab root finder that I was using and it doesn't crash anymore. I then went on to quickly investigate the polynomials Fixed Point proposed. Here are the results: Figure1: Up to degree 17 the root finder keeps the results on the real axis. From degree 18 onwards the calculated roots gain an imaginary part which grows linearly with the degree of the polynomial. The ratio between the constant coefficient $a_0$ and the highest order coefficient $a_n$ is in the order of $10^{-16}$ when the roots begin to diverge from the real axis and grows with approximately one order of magnitude per increase of polynomial degree. Figure2: Here the constant coefficient is set to zero, one can see that the roots that are close to each other get perturbed quite significantly. The Matlab code to reproduce the results can be downloaded here . EDIT 2: To address Fixed Point's questions: Since Brent's algorithm is guaranteed to converge (it could be slow but it will converge), I am curious as to why you were having the problem that you said you were. When developing the MIMO extension for ANP (animated nyquist diagram, a leisure project for educational purposes) I came to realize that the program would have to deal with high order polynomials even for small MIMO systems. I then noticed that Matlab's 'roots' would produce very inaccurate results when there were roots with high multiplicity present - even in trivial, obvious cases like $(x+1)^4=0$ (try roots(poly([-1,-1,-1,-1])) ). Even if my program should only be used for entertainment, that wasn't good enough. After finding Multroot (by Zeng) and unit-testing it with quite some success using randomized MIMO systems I found that besides some trivial to solve crashes it had a more severe flaw that had to do with a small constant term. How/why was your application crashing?

EDIT: adding $\infty$ to the domain and working under the projective reals gives $\infty$ as the identity. I've done a lot of playing around with simple properties of ⊕ and found many interesting things about it, such as ways to do arithmetic using it - for instance: $$\frac{a}{x}⊕\frac{a}{y} = \frac{a}{x+y}$$ Which means one would ""o-plus"" fractions by finding a common numerator instead of a common denominator. Also, just as repeated addition is a form of multiplication( $a+a+a+a = 4a$ ), repeated ""o-plussing"" is a form of division. $$a⊕a⊕a⊕a = \frac{a}{4}$$ There are a multitude of cool properties that come out of the definition of this operation that I've defined here, including one the the aforementioned 3Blue1Brown explains in this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOtduunD9hA ): $$\sqrt[a] x \sqrt[b] x = \sqrt[a⊕b]{x}$$ One other thing I found was the derivative of two ""o-plussed"" functions: $$\frac{d}{dx}(f(x)⊕g(x)) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)^2 + g'(x)f(x)^2}{(f(x)+g(x))^2}$$ which looks over-complicated, and I think it is. I'd like to find a way to describe this function that actually includes the ⊕ operation itself, but have been unable to find one. However, there is a nice parallel which I found which makes more sense of this derivative rule: $$ f⊕g = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{f}+\frac{1}{g}} = \frac{fg}{f+g} = \frac{fg}{f+g}\frac{(f+g)}{(f+g)} = \frac{fg^2+gf^2}{(f+g)^2}$$ which parallels perfectly with what I said before, $$ (f⊕g)' = \frac{f'g^2+g'f^2}{(f+g)^2}.$$ Again, my question is if there exists a generally accepted notation or mathematical discussion of this operation, or if it is used or mathematically discussed outside of a few very specific locations. If not, could anybody just offer comments on my work or prove other interesting properties of this operation? Thanks to anybody for your help! EDIT: Thanks to dls's comment about the Harmonic Mean, I've also found that a⊕b is the solution to the ""crossed ladder problem"" Which asks to find h, given A and B as heights to ""cross ladders"" over. PHOTO: Wikipedia. This leads me to believe it would be natural to define a⊕0 to be zero, since the lines given those heights would intersect at a height of 0. This is not a formal 'definition', just pattern-continuation. One might also define a⊕-a to be 'infinite', since that seems to solve the associativity problem in some cases, though this may not rigorously work... Edit: Since oplus is so closely related to the Harmonic Mean, it's also interesting to view how the definition of the oplus operation makes the connection between the three means (arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) so much more natural. Starting with the arithmetic mean, $$A = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n{x_i}$$ we see it involves repeated addition, followed by division, which is the inverse of multiplication (the operation which repeated addition of the same number defines). Similarly, for the geometric mean, $$G = ({\prod_{i=0}^n{x_i}})^{1/n}$$ it involves repeated multiplication, followed by a root, which is the inverse of exponentiation (the operation which repeated multiplication of the same number defines). And finally, the harmonic mean can be written, (there is no easy way to write this in a similar notation to the above, but the idea is the same) $$H = n(x_i⊕x_2⊕x_3⊕...⊕x_n) $$ which involves repeated oplussing, followed by multiplication, which is the inverse of division (the operation which repeated oplussing of the same number defines - as described above). I find this parallel to be an extremely natural way to define the Harmonic mean, and any mean for that matter. In fact, one might imagine a mean defined by any operation of any order (for example, an exponentiation mean, which would use repeated exponentiation followed by a super-root, the inverse of tetration). UPDATE: I have found a really cool connection between this operation and another area: Since the oplussing of two real numbers creates an output which is less than both of the originals, I wanted to see what conditions were necessary for the case to be that this is true: $$x⊕y=x-y$$ and the result was fantastic (derivation below)! $$x⊕y=x-y$$ $$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} = x-y$$ $$\frac{xy}{x+y} = x-y$$ $$xy = x^2-y^2$$ $$0 = x^2-xy-y^2$$ and, using the quadratic formula, $$x = \frac{y±\sqrt{y^2+4y^2}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{5}}{2}$$ which means that the ratio between x and y is φ≈1.618, the golden ratio! $$x = φy$$ And through this, I saw that only the quadratic formula was necessary to find this ratio, and wondered if there was a number (clearly complex) which might satisfy: $$x⊕y=x+y$$ and there is! $$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} = x+y$$ $$\frac{xy}{x+y} = x+y$$ $$xy = x^2+2xy+y^2$$ $$0 = x^2+xy+y^2$$ $$x = \frac{-y±\sqrt{y^2-4y^2}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{-3}}{2}$$ $$x = y\frac{1±\sqrt{3}i}{2}$$ And this is an extremely interesting number - I call it (and I found one internet forum from 2011 which has also named it this) the ""imaginary golden ratio"". $$φ_i = \frac{1+\sqrt{3}i}{2}$$ It has a ton of interesting properties similar to the real golden ratio, and some of its own. I was wondering if anybody could help me uncover a bit of this mystery. Once I am able to write a question which asks more in depth about this number, because I'd like to reignite a discussion that seems to have been left unmentioned since the other forum in 2011. Here are some properties of the imaginary golden ratio. $$φ_i = cos(π/3)+ isin(π/3) = e^{iπ/3}$$ $$|φ_i|=1$$ $$φ_i^2=φ_i-1$$ which parallels $$φ^2=φ+1$$ Here is the link to the other forum: http://mymathforum.com/number-theory/17605-imaginary-golden-ratio.html","I have recently found some interesting properties of the function/operation: where . and similarly, its inverse operation: This is a formula often used in physics, for calculating equivalent resistance/capacitance in circuits.

One might also define a⊕-a to be 'infinite', since that seems to solve the associativity problem in some cases, though this may not rigorously work... Edit: Since oplus is so closely related to the Harmonic Mean, it's also interesting to view how the definition of the oplus operation makes the connection between the three means (arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) so much more natural. Starting with the arithmetic mean, we see it involves repeated addition, followed by division, which is the inverse of multiplication (the operation which repeated addition of the same number defines). Similarly, for the geometric mean, it involves repeated multiplication, followed by a root, which is the inverse of exponentiation (the operation which repeated multiplication of the same number defines). And finally, the harmonic mean can be written, (there is no easy way to write this in a similar notation to the above, but the idea is the same) which involves repeated oplussing, followed by multiplication, which is the inverse of division (the operation which repeated oplussing of the same number defines - as described above). I find this parallel to be an extremely natural way to define the Harmonic mean, and any mean for that matter. In fact, one might imagine a mean defined by any operation of any order (for example, an exponentiation mean, which would use repeated exponentiation followed by a super-root, the inverse of tetration). UPDATE: I have found a really cool connection between this operation and another area: Since the oplussing of two real numbers creates an output which is less than both of the originals, I wanted to see what conditions were necessary for the case to be that this is true: and the result was fantastic (derivation below)! and, using the quadratic formula, which means that the ratio between x and y is φ≈1.618, the golden ratio! And through this, I saw that only the quadratic formula was necessary to find this ratio, and wondered if there was a number (clearly complex) which might satisfy: and there is! And this is an extremely interesting number - I call it (and I found one internet forum from 2011 which has also named it this) the ""imaginary golden ratio"". It has a ton of interesting properties similar to the real golden ratio, and some of its own. I was wondering if anybody could help me uncover a bit of this mystery. Once I am able to write a question which asks more in depth about this number, because I'd like to reignite a discussion that seems to have been left unmentioned since the other forum in 2011.

For example, one might say that $f$ is a function of $x$ , and then differentiate $f$ ""with respect to $x$ "".

The answers seemed to discuss either what a function is, but I know what a function is. I am also unsatisfied with the suggestion that $f$ is a function of $x$ if we just label its argument as $x$ , since labels are arbitrary. I could write $f(x)$ for some value in the domain of $f$ , but couldn't I equally well write $f(t)$ or $f(w)$ instead? To illustrate my confusion with a concrete example: consider the cumulative amount of wax burnt, $w$ as a candle burns. In a simple picture, we could say that $w$ depends on the amount of time for which the candle has been burning, and so we might say something like "" $w$ is a function of time"". In this simple picture, $w$ is a function of a single real variable. My confusion is, why do we actually say that $w$ is a function of time? Surely $w$ is just a function on some subset of the real numbers (depending specifically on how we chose to define $w$ ), rather than a function of time? Sure, $w$ only has the interpretation we think it does (cumulative amount of wax burnt) when we provide a time as its argument, but why does that mean it is a function of time ? There's nothing stopping me from putting any old argument (provided $w$ is defined at that point) in to $w$ , like the distance I have walked since the candle was lit. Sure, we can't really interpret $w$ in the same way if I did this, but there is nothing in the definition of $w$ which stops me from doing this. Also, what happens when I do some differentiation on $w$ . If I differentiate $w$ ""with respect to time"", then I'd get the time rate at which the candle is burning. If I differentiate $w$ ""with respect to"" the distance I have walked since the candle was lit, I'd expect to get either zero (since $w$ is not a function of this), or something more complicated (since the distance I have walked is related to time).

Shouldn't there just be ""the derivative of w"", found by differentiating $w$ with respect to its argument (writing ""with respect to its argument"" is redundant!).

75,Are infinitesimals dangerous?,Are infinitesimals dangerous?,,"Amir Alexander is a historian of mathematics.  His new book is entitled ""Infinitesimal: How a Dangerous Mathematical Theory Shaped the Modern World"".  See here . Two questions: (1) In what sense are these dangerous? (2) The ban on infinitesimals and the trial against Galileo's alleged endorsement of heliocentrism date from the same year: 1632 (and in fact occurred within a month of each other). Is there any reason for such a coincidence? What I find particularly interesting is Alexander's comment that infinitesimals were officially declared forbidden by catholic clerics on 10 august 1632.  The reason this is interesting is because the date 1632 falls precisely in a critical period in Fermat's mathematical activity.  Fermat originally introduced his techique of adequality in 1629, but it was first made known to a wider audience in the late 1630s. In the meantime infinitesimals have been declared persona non-grata . This may explain Fermat's legendary reluctance to talk about infinitesimals. In this he may have been more affected than for instance Wallis who spoke freely about infinitesimals. Wallis was not catholic but a presbyterian. Note 1. Wiki reports that the original heliocentric ban dates from 1615. Furthermore, In September 1632, Galileo was ordered to come to Rome to stand trial. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Thus the infinitesimal ban from august 1632 seems to be a separate development. Note 2. Here is Amir Alexander's own description of his historical work: I am currently working on a new book, provisionally entitled Infinitely Small, which examines the interconnections between mathematics and political and social order. Mathematics, at its most abstract, is the science of order, and it follows that different conceptions of mathematics have been associated with different views of proper social arrangements. In particular, the book will examine a sequence of historical instances in which mathematical infinitesimals acquired political significance, showing that even the purest mathematics can at times serve to buttress or undermine a political order. See here . Note 3. Paulos provides a hint of an answer in the following terms: To the Jesuits, tradition, resoluteness and authority seemed bound up with Euclid and Catholicism; chaos, confusion and paradoxes were associated with infinitesimals and the motley array of proliferating Protestant sects.

My attempt is to say that $ab$ could be the surface of a rectangle, and that we could also say that: $\dfrac{a^{p}}{p}=\displaystyle \int_{0}^{a}x^{p-1}dx$, but them I'm stuck.","Is there a geometric interpretation of Young's inequality, $$ab \leq \frac{a^{p}}{p} + \frac{b^{q}}{q}$$ with $\dfrac{1}{p}+\dfrac{1}{q} = 1$?

97,Can someone provide the formal definition of the tangent line to a curve?,Can someone provide the formal definition of the tangent line to a curve?,,"I was recently explaining differentiation from first principles to a colleague and how differentiation can be used to obtain the tangent line to a curve at any point. While doing this, my colleague came back at me with an argument for which I had no satisfactory reply. I was describing the tangent line to a curve at a specific point in the same way that I was taught at school - that it is a line that just touches the curve at that point and has gradient equal to the derivative of the curve at that point . My colleague then said that for a cubic curve, the line can touch the curve again at other points so I explained the concept again but restricted to a neighbourhood about the point in question. He then came back with the argument of this definition when the ""curve"" in question is a straight line. He argued that in this case the definition of the tangent line as ""just touching the curve at that point"" is simply not true as it is coincident with the line itself and so touches at all points. I had no comeback to this argument at all and had to concede that I should have just defined the tangent as the line passing through the point on the curve that has gradient equal to the derivative at that point. Now this whole exchange left me feeling rather stupid as I hold a Phd in Maths myself and I could not adequately define a tangent without using the notion of differential calculus - and yet when I was taught calculus at school it was shown as a tool to calculate the gradient of a tangent line and so this becomes a circular argument. I have given this serious thought and can find no argument to counter my colleagues observation of the inadequacy of the informal definition in the case when the curve in question is already a straight line. Also, if I do this again in future with another colleague how can I avoid embarrassment again? At what point did I go wrong here with my explanations? Should I have avoided the geometric view completely and gone with rate of changes instead? I am not a teacher but have taught calculus from first principles to many people over the years and would be very interested in how it should be done properly.","I was recently explaining differentiation from first principles to a colleague and how differentiation can be used to obtain the tangent line to a curve at any point.
