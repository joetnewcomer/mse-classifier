G is Abelian if and only if H is Abelian 3. G is cyclic if and only if H is cyclic. 4. If K is a subgroup of G, the $\phi$(K)={$\phi$(k)|k$\in$K} is a subgroup of H. 5.

Thanks.","I am having trouble proving the following result: ""Suppose $a$ belongs to a group and $|a|=5$.  Prove that $C(a)=C(a^3)$."" ($C(a)$ denotes the centralizer of $a$) The typical way to do this would be to show that $C(a) \subseteq C(a^3)$ and $C(a^3) \subseteq C(a)$.  The first direction is easy: Let $g \in C(a)$ be arbitrary.  Then $ga^3=aga^2=a^2ga=a^3g$, so $g \in C(a^3)$ and $C(a) \subseteq C(a^3)$. I'm having a hard time with the other direction, including seeing how $|a|=5$ works into it. The problem also asks to find an element $a$ from some group such that $|a|=6$ and $C(a) \ne C(a^3)$.  This makes me curious: for an element $a$, is it true that $C(a)=C(a^i)$ when $\gcd(|a|,i)=1$, and thus $|a|=|a^i|$? I'd appreciate a HINT on how to go about proving the original problem, and the generalization if it is indeed true. Thanks.",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

My argument went like this:  let $a,b \in R$ then $ab\in R$ cause $R$ is a ring.  Therefore $abab=ab$. Now $aabb=ab$ as well, so $$abab=aabb\ \Rightarrow abab-aabb=0 \Rightarrow\ a(ba-ab)b=0\ \because\text{ distributive property of $R$}.$$ Now because R is not a division ring then the element $a$ could be a divisor of zero or $b$ could be as well so you cannot just assume $ba-ab=0$.
