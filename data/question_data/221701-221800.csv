2,Compactness of Algebraic Curves over $\mathbb C^2$,Compactness of Algebraic Curves over,\mathbb C^2,"I was reading through Kirwan's Complex Algebraic Curves and I've been stuck on the following exercise: Given a (non-constant) polynomial $P(x,y)$, show that the curve in $\mathbb C^2$ defined by $P(x,y)=0$ is not compact. My attempt at a solution: If we can show that there are only finitely many $a\in \mathbb C$ such that there is no $b \in C$ with $P(a,b)=0$, I think we're done. Once we've shown this, we can consider any sequence of complex numbers $x_n$ with $|x|=n$. For all but finitely many $x_n$, there is then some $y_n$ with $P(x_n,y_n)=0$. This implies then that the curve defined by $P$ isn't bounded, and thus is not compact. I'm unsure as to my proof of this step though, and would love some input on my sketch. Fix $a_0$, and assume $P(a_0,y)$, viewed as a polynomial in $\mathbb C[y]$, has no roots. Clearly then $P(a_0,y)=c_0$ for some $c_0 \in \mathbb C$. Then $a_0$ is a root of $P(x,y)-c_0$, so we can write $P(x,y)-c_0=(x-a_0)\cdot f_0(x,y)$ for some polynomial $f_0(x,y)$. Now, fix $a_1$ distinct from $a_0$ and assume $P(a_1,y)$ is some constant $c_1$. Then $P(a_1,y)=c_1$, so $P(a_1,y)-c_0=c_1-c_0$ and then $(a_1-a_0)\cdot f_0(a_1,y)=c_1-c_0$. Thus $a_1$ is a root of $f_0(x,y)-\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}$, so we can write $f_0(x,y)-\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}=(x-a_1)\cdot f_1(x,y)$, for some polymomial $f_1$ of degree strictly less than $f_0$, and thus $P(x,y)=(x-a_0)(x-a_1)f_1(x,y)+(x-a_1)\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}+c_0$. If we continue in this fashion, we obtain a sequence of polynomials $f_i$ of strictly decreasing degree. This must terminate in finitely many steps, so there can only be finitely many distinct $a_i$. Does this look like the right idea? I feel like I'm probably over-complicating this step, so if anyone has  a more elegant solution I'd love to hear it!","I was reading through Kirwan's Complex Algebraic Curves and I've been stuck on the following exercise: Given a (non-constant) polynomial $P(x,y)$, show that the curve in $\mathbb C^2$ defined by $P(x,y)=0$ is not compact.

It is a particular case of the Kan extension. (Here we consider only presheaves of sets.) These functors can be defined as follows: $$u_!F(Y)=\varinjlim_{Y\to u(X)} F(X)$$ $$u_*F(Y)=\varprojlim_{u(X)\to Y} F(X)$$ for any $Y\in \mathcal{D},\; F\in PSh(\mathcal{C})$ , see Theorem 2.3.3 on Kan extensions in Kashiwara-Schapira ""Categories and Sheaves"" (here the limits are reversed since we work with contravariant functors = presheaves). I try to understand this construction in the case of topological spaces. Let $f\colon Y\to X$ be a continuous map of topological spaces. Let $Op(X)$ , $Op(Y)$ be the categories of open subsets where morphisms are inclusions. Then there is a functor $u\colon Op(X)\to Op(Y)$ which sends $U\subset X$ to $f^{-1}U\subset Y$ . Then we get a functor $u^*\colon PSh(Y)\to PSh(X)$ which is the usual pushforward $f_*$ . The functor $$u_!F(V)=\varinjlim_{V\subset f^{-1}(U)} F(U)=\varinjlim_{f(V)\subset U} F(U)=f^{-1}F(V)$$ is the usual pullback for presheaves. However, I cannot unfold the definition of the second adjoint $u_*$ . By the general definition above, one should have $$u_*F(V)=\varprojlim_{f^{-1}(U)\subset V} F(U).$$ But then it is not clear how the restriction maps look like: for an inclusion $V\subset V^\prime$ of open subsets in $Y$ we should have a map $$u_*F(V^\prime)=\varprojlim_{f^{-1}(U)\subset V^\prime} F(U) \to \varprojlim_{f^{-1}(U)\subset V} F(U)=u_*F(V).$$ However, each $f^{-1}(U)$ contained in $V$ is contained in $V^\prime$ and not vice versa.

Functoriality for presheaves says that for any functor the precomposition functor has two adjoints on the left and on the right correspondingly, see SGA 4, Exposé I, Proposition 5.1 or ncatlab or stacks 1 , stacks 2 . It is a particular case of the Kan extension. (Here we consider only presheaves of sets.) These functors can be defined as follows: for any , see Theorem 2.3.3 on Kan extensions in Kashiwara-Schapira ""Categories and Sheaves"" (here the limits are reversed since we work with contravariant functors = presheaves). I try to understand this construction in the case of topological spaces. Let be a continuous map of topological spaces. Let , be the categories of open subsets where morphisms are inclusions. Then there is a functor which sends to . Then we get a functor which is the usual pushforward . The functor is the usual pullback for presheaves. However, I cannot unfold the definition of the second adjoint .

65,Real forms of $\mathbb{G}_m$ as a variety,Real forms of  as a variety,\mathbb{G}_m,"Notation: Denote $k=\mathbb{R}$ , $K=\mathbb{C}$ and let $G:=\text{Gal}(K/k)=\{\text{id},\sigma\}$ , where $\sigma$ is complex conjugation. Background: In the Notices article A Gentle Introduction to Arithmetic Toric Varieties the author introduces (in slightly different notation) three varieties over $k$ : $\mathbb{G}_m=\{uv-1=0\}$ , $\text{S}^1=\{x^2+y^2-1=0\}$ , $Y=\{a^2+b^2+1=0\}$ . He establishes that they are pairwise non-isomorphic: e.g. looking at the real points in Euclidean topology $\mathbb{G}_m(k)$ has two connected components, while $\text{S}^1(k)$ has only a single connected component and $Y(k)=\emptyset$ has no $k$ -points at all. He then explains that $\mathbb{G}_m$ and $\text{S}^1$ are twisted forms of each other, since they become isomorphic (as affine $K$ -varieties) after base change to $K$ , explicitly: $$\varphi:\text{S}^1\times_kK\rightarrow\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK,\quad (x,y)\mapsto(u,v)=(x+iy,x-iy).$$ Explicitly the inverse morphism is given by: $$\varphi^{-1}:\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK\rightarrow\text{S}^1\times_kK,\quad (u,v)\mapsto(x,y)=\left(\frac{u+v}{2},\frac{u-v}{2i}\right).$$ As far as I see $Y$ also becomes isomorphic to $\mathbb{G}_m$ and $\text{S}^1$ after base change to $K$ , an isomorphism is given e.g. by: $$\psi:\text{S}^1\times_kK\rightarrow Y\times_kK,\quad (x,y)\mapsto(a,b)=(ix,iy),$$ $$\psi^{-1}:Y\times_kK\rightarrow\text{S}^1\times_kK,\quad (a,b)\mapsto(x,y)=(-ia,-ib).$$ This would indicate that the complex affine variety $\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK$ has (at least) 3 distinct real forms, namely $\mathbb{G}_m, \text{S}^1$ and $Y$ . Note that I do not consider the structure of a group variety, with which you could endow $\mathbb{G}_m, \text{S}^1$ in the usual way but not $Y$ as it is pointless (over $k$ ). As is well known for classes of varieties $X$ that form a ‘stack’ (e.g. quasi-projective varieties - so affine $X$ is OK) $k$ -forms of some $X\times_kK$ are in bijection to $$\text{Tw}(X)=\text{H}^1_{\text{gal}}(k,\text{Aut}_{\text{var}}(X\times_kK))=\text{H}^1_{\text{grp}}(\text{Gal}(K/k),\text{Aut}_{\text{var}}(X\times_kK))$$ (cf., e.g., Gille/Szamuely, ""Central Simple Algebras and Galois Cohomology"", Thm. 2.3.3 and sec. 5.2 for special versions). The author claims $$\text{Tw}(\mathbb{G}_m)=\{\mathbb{G}_m, \text{S}^1\}$$ only contains 2 distinct elements. And indeed using this post (and using that morphisms of affine varieties are in bijection to algebra morphisms) we see that $\text{End}_{\text{var}}(\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK)\cong\left\{a\cdot t^n:a\in K^{\times},n\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}$ and therefore $A:=\text{Aut}_{\text{var}}(\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK)\cong\left\{a\cdot t^n:a\in K^{\times},n\in\mathbb{Z}^{\times}=\{\pm 1\}\right\}\cong K^{\times}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . The Galois action of $\text{G}$ on $A$ is induced by $\tilde{\sigma}:A\rightarrow A, (a,\pm 1)\mapsto(\sigma(a),\pm 1)=(\bar{a},\pm 1)$ using the identification with $K^{\times}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ just given. Using the standard method to compute group cohomology for cyclic groups through norm and difference maps, $N=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{2-1}\tilde{\sigma}^i=\tilde{\sigma}+\tilde{\text{id}}$ and $\Delta=\tilde{\sigma}-\tilde{\text{id}}$ (cf., e.g., Gille/Szamuely, Ex. 3.2.9), as $$\text{H}^1_{\text{grp}}(\text{G},A)\cong\text{ker}(N)/\text{im}(\Delta)$$ this can easily seen to indeed be $\cong\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . Question: Since $3>2$ there must be a mistake in these considerations: What is this mistake and what is $\text{Tw}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ ? Remark 1: As indicated above one could also look at the additional structure of group varieties. For this variant we have, if I am not mistaken, $B:=\text{Aut}_{\text{grp-var}}(\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK)\cong\left\{1\cdot t^n:n\in\mathbb{Z}^{\times}=\{\pm 1\}\right\}\cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ which yields $\text{Tw}_{\text{grp-var}}(\mathbb{G}_m)=\text{H}^1_{\text{grp}}(\text{G},B)\cong\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ . Since $Y$ has no $k$ -point it cannot have the structure of a group variety, thus $Y$ is no real form of the complex group variety $\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK$ and there is no contradiction from the above arguments. The issue therefore lies in classifying real forms of $\mathbb{G}_m\times_kK$ as only affine $k$ -varieties without any (potential) group structure. Remark 2: I choose the notation $K/k$ to indicate that analogous issues should also arise for e.g. $\mathbb{Q}(i)/\mathbb{Q}$ the Gaussian rationals and probably even in positive characteristic (probably $\neq 2$ , since $\varphi^{-1}$ requires inversion of $2$ ).","Notation: Denote , and let , where is complex conjugation.
