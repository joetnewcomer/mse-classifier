0,Convex function is proper when it has at least one finite value in the relative interior of its effective domain,Convex function is proper when it has at least one finite value in the relative interior of its effective domain,,"Problem Statement let $f: \mathbb{E}\mapsto \bar{\mathbb{R}}$ be a convex function, show that if there exists a point $x\in \text{ri}(\text{dom}(f))$ with $f(x)$ taking a finite value, then $f$ must be proper. This is an exercise problem that is highly relevant to Rockafellar's Textbook on Variational Analysis. There was a similar exercise related to improper function, but professor tweaked it. My Take So far this is my take, I don't think it's correct, or rigorous. $\text{epi}(f)$ is convex, then $$ f\left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i x_i \right) \le \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i f(x_i) \quad \lambda \in \Delta_n, x_i \in \text{dom}(f) $$ Convexity of Epigraph implies an inequality, relating to the convex combinations of points in the effective domain of the function $f(x)$ . Now consider fixing value of $a \in \text{dom}(f)$ such that $f(a)$ is finite, then ( Not very rigours here ): $$ a = \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i x_i $$ A can be represented as a convex combination of points in the affective domain of the function. Then: $$ -\infty < f(a) = f\left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i x_i \right) \le \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i f(x_i) $$ Therefore, for any $x_i$ , $f(x_i)$ is not $-\infty$ , the function is proper. However, I don't understand why the original statement stated the existence of finite value inside the Relative Interior of the Affective Domain, instead of just the effective domain? I am not sure how many points I should choose to construct the convex combinations to be equal to $a$ , nor I am sure whether is possible.

19,Change of Variables and Integration Domain,Change of Variables and Integration Domain,,"This is a purely theoretic problem which doesn't involve any specific calculation. Suppose we have two coordinate systems for $\mathbb R^2$ and they are $xy$ -system and $uv$ -system respectively. Suppose we have $x=g(u,v)$ and $y=h(u,v)$ and we know both $g$ and $h$ are continuously differentiable, i.e. $C^1$ . Suppose the mapping $T(u,v):=(g(u,v),h(u,v))=(x,y)$ is injective. Suppose we have a small rectangle $S$ in the $uv$ -plane. The general idea to prove the formula for change of variables is approximating the image of $S$ under $T$ in the $xy$ -plane by a parallelogram in the $xy$ -plane. People use the image of the boundary of $S$ under $T$ to calculate the area of the parallelogram I quoted. By doing this, people use the fact that $T$ preserves boundaries, i.e. $T(\partial S)=\partial [T(S)].$ My question is , how can we assure that $T(\partial S)=\partial [T(S)]$ ? If the equality is not true, then how do we approximate the parallelogram in the $xy$ -plane? I know the equality is true if $T$ is a homeomorphism, but under our assumption, $T$ may not have a continuous inverse(though $T^{-1}$ is always defined on $T(S)$ due to our injective condition). Edit: I think I missed an important condition that the Jacobian determinant $\frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)}$ is nonzero in the interior of the integral domain in the $uv$ -plane. If we have this condition, then we can use the Inverse Function Theorem to guarantee the existence of local homeomorphism, and then our operation is valid.(Am I right?) Second Edit: In my calculus book, the formula for change of variables doesn't require the Jacobian determinant is nonzero. I am stuck here again. Third Edit: Intuitively I feel like the Jacobian must be nonzero and so I am trying to prove it now. Suppose the Jacobian is zero on a set with positive measure, which is denoted by $E$ . The key equation in the proof is that $$dx\,dy= \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} du\,dv.$$ On $E$ , we can have some $du,dv$ s.t. $du>0$ and $dv>0$ . Since the Jacobian is zero on $E$ , we have $dx\,dy=0$ . So a rectangle with area of $du\,dv(>0)$ is mapped to a set with zero measure by an injective continuous function $T$ , where $T$ is defined as above.

Then using Theorem 9.6 which tells us that whatever the summable function $f$ in the segment $[a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ , in almost all points the equality $$\dfrac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\int_{a}^{x}f(t) \ dt = f(x)$$ Then the $F^\prime (x)$ is equal to. $$F^\prime(x) = \dfrac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} x}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\sin {xt}}{1+t} \ dt = \dfrac{\sin {x(1)}}{1+(1)} = \dfrac{\sin {x}}{2}$$ Many thanks","could you please help me.

To study the uniform convergence I must evaluate $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left|\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2}-1\right|=\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left(1-\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2}\right)$$ Since the derivative of $1-\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2}$ exists for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ , it is $$\frac{d}{dx} \left(1-\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2}\right)=\frac{n}{1+n^2} \sin \frac{nx}{1+n^2} \geq 0$$ $$\iff 2k\pi \leq \frac{nx}{1+n^2} \leq (2k+1)\pi \iff \frac{1+n^2}{n}2k\pi \leq x \leq \frac{1+n^2}{n}(2k+1)\pi$$ For $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ , so $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\left(1-\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2}\right)=\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1-\cos \frac{n \left(\frac{1+n^2}{n}(2k+1)\pi\right)}{1+n^2}\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}(1-\cos\pi)=2$$ So $f_n$ is not uniformly convergent in $\mathbb{R}$ . Is this correct? Some more questions: I've noticed that $f_n(\frac{1+n^2}{n})=\cos 1$ , can I conclude that since there exists at least one $\bar{x}=\frac{1+n^2}{n}$ such that $|f_n(\bar{x})-f(\bar{x})|=1-\cos 1 \ne 0$ so $f_n$ cannot be uniform convergent in whole $\mathbb{R}$ because it it will never be $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ because of $\bar{x}$ . Is this correct? It is $\cos \frac{nx}{1+n^2} \approx 1-\frac{n^2 x^2}{2(1+n^2)^2}$ as $n \to \infty$ , can this be useful to evaluate the limit of the supremum?

40,"How to prove that the inverse of a continuous strictly monotone increasing function is continuous? (Terence Tao Analysis 1, Proposition 9.8.3)","How to prove that the inverse of a continuous strictly monotone increasing function is continuous? (Terence Tao Analysis 1, Proposition 9.8.3)",,"I'm having some problems proving the inverse is continuous. The hint in the book is to use the standard epsilon-delta definition of continuity. I believe the easiest route is a proof by contradiction, but with all of the quantifiers in the statement, I may be incorrectly negating the statement I am trying to prove. Also, I have at my disposal the intermediate value theorem, which most of my proof relies on. Below is the proposition: Let $a < b$ be real numbers, and let $ f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R} $ be a function which is both continuous and strictly monotone increasing. Then $f$ is a bijection from $[a, b]$ to $[f(a), f(b)]$ , and the inverse $f^{-1}: [f(a), f(b)] \to [a, b]$ is also continuous and strictly monotone increasing. Below is my attempt at a proof: Let $x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]$ be real numbers such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ . From the trichotomy of the real numbers, we have that exactly one of the following is true: $x_1 = x_2$ , $x_1 < x_2$ , or $x_1 > x_2$ . Suppose $x_1 \not = x_2$ . Then, by definition of strictly increasing monotone functions, we have that $f(x_1) \not = f(x_2)$ . Thus, $x_1 = x_2$ , and $f$ is injective. Now let $y \in [f(a), f(b)]$ be a real number. Then, by the intermediate value theorem, there exists a real number $c \in [a, b]$ such that $f(c) = y$ . Thus, $f$ is a surjection from $[a, b]$ to $[f(a), f(b)]$ . Since $f$ is both injective and surjective, we can conclude that $f$ is a bijection from $[a, b]$ to $[f(a), f(b)]$ . To show that $f^{-1}$ is strictly monotone increasing, let $y_1, y_2 \in [f(a), f(b)]$ be real numbers such that $y_1 < y_2$ . Then,by the intermediate value theorem, there exist $x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]$ such that $f(x_1) = y_1$ and $f(x_2) = y_2$ . Since $f$ is strictly monotone increasing, we have $x_1 < x_2$ . Using the definition of an inverse, we have \begin{align*}f^{-1}(y_1) &= f^{-1}(f(x_1)) \\&= x_1 \\&< x_2 \\&= f^{-1}(f(x_2)) \\&=f^{-1}(y_2) \text{,}\end{align*} showing that $f^{-1}$ is strictly monotone increasing. Finally, we will show that $f^{-1}$ is continuous. Let $y_0 \in [f(a), f(b)]$ be a real number, and let $\epsilon > 0 $ be a real number. As before, there exists a real number $x_0 \in [a, b]$ such that $f(x_0) = y_0$ . Likewise, for any real number $y \in [f(a), f(b)]$ , the intermediate value theorem tells us that there exists a real number $x \in [a, b]$ such that $f(x) = y$ . We want to show that there exists a $\delta > 0 $ such that $ | f^{-1}(y) -f^{-1}( y_0) | < \epsilon$ for all $y \in [f(a), f(b)]$ such that $|y - y_0| < \delta$ . This is equivalent to showing that there exists a $\delta > 0 $ such that $ | x - x_0 | < \epsilon$ for all $f(x) \in [f(a), f(b)]$ such that $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \delta$ . Written in the order we are more accustomed to, this is equivalent to showing that there exists a $\delta > 0 $ such that $|f(x) - f(x_0)| < \delta$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $|x - x_0| < \epsilon$ . Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $f^{-1}$ is not continuous. That is, suppose for all $\delta > 0$ , there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $|f(x) - f(x_0)| \ge \delta$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $|x - x_0| < \epsilon$ . I am not really sure where to go from here, and I'm not certain I correctly negated the statement that the inverse of $f$ is continuous. Any help is greatly appreciated. P.S. This is not for any homework, just self study. I've never taken a class in analysis, so please feel free to point out anything I am doing wrong (or that is less than rigorous).","I'm having some problems proving the inverse is continuous.

52,Conceptual Clarification: Rudin's Definition of a Differential Form of Order k,Conceptual Clarification: Rudin's Definition of a Differential Form of Order k,,"Broad Context As the title suggests, I'm reading Rudin's POMA (3e) and have gotten to chapter 10. Miscellaneous online resources have not been as useful as always, since Rudin (notably, I think) defines differential forms without making any mention whatsoever of manifolds, tensor products, or the exterior algebra (which are all things I've found via. google, and which I do not yet know about). Presumably, Rudin's definition should be understandable without any of these concepts, or else he would have had to introduce them. Narrow Context I expect half of the problem will be notation. Here are the definitions I'm working with. $\mathbf{\mathscr{C}'}$ -Mapping: Let $X$ and $Y$ be normed vector spaces over $\mathbb{C}$ . Let $B(X,Y)$ denote the set of all bounded linear mappings $X \to Y$ . Let $A$ be an open subset of $X$ (with distances measured in terms of the norm of $X$ ) such that every $a \in A$ is a limit point of $A$ . Let $f : A \to Y$ be a map. $f$ is said to be $\mathscr{C}'$ in $A$ if $f$ is Frechet differntiable on $A$ and (letting $\mathcal{D} f(x)$ denote the derivative) the map $A \to B(X,Y) : x \mapsto \mathcal{D} f(x)$ is continuous on $A$ (with distances in $B(X,Y)$ measured in terms of the operator norm). Full disclose, I've expanded the above definition to a slightly more general context than Rudin presents (definition 9.20 POMA). $\mathbf{k}$ -Surface in $\mathbf{A}$ : Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. Let $A$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Rudin defines a $k$ -surface in $A$ to be a $\mathscr{C}'$ mapping $K \to A$ , where $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ . In particular, Rudin says we are to confine our attention to the situation in which $K$ in the above definition is either a $k$ -cell (by which it is meant a Cartesian product of $k$ non-degenerate closed intervals of real numbers), or is the standard $k$ -simplex. Note, the above is Def 10.10 and the below is Def 10.11 in POMA. Differential Form of Order $\mathbf{k \geq 1}$ : Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be open. Let $\Omega(A)$ denote the set of all $k$ -surfaces in $A$ (this is my own notation). Let $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n$ denote the component functions of a given $\Phi\in\Omega(A)$ . A differential form of order $k$ is a function $\omega : \Omega(A)\to\mathbb{R}$ determined by the rule $$   \Phi \mapsto \int_{\text{dom}(\Phi)}           \sum a_{i_1}\cdots\hspace{0.5mm}_{i_k}\big(\Phi(\mathbf{u})\big)           \det \big(              \mathcal{D} (\phi_{i_1}(\mathbf{u}),\ldots,\phi_{i_k}(\mathbf{u}))          \big) \mathrm{d} \mathbf{u} $$ where the integral is a classical (what I would call iteratively defined) multiple integral over the compact subset dom $(\Phi)$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ (that is, the domain of $\Phi$ ). Also, the indices $i_1,\ldots,i_k$ ""range independently from $1$ to $n$ ,"" and ""the functions $a_{i_1}\cdots\hspace{0.5mm}_{i_k}$ are assumed to be real and continuous"" on $A$ .   Moreover, Rudin says that the above rule is ""symbolically represented by the sum"" $$   \omega = \sum a_{i_1}\cdots\hspace{0.5mm}_{i_k}(\mathbf{x})\hspace{1mm}            \mathrm{d}_{x_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}_{x_k}. $$ Rudin does not provide any sort of definition of "" $x \wedge y$ ."" The Question Did I happen to get anything wrong in the above definitions? Is the summation taken over $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ , over $(i_1,\ldots,i_k)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^k$ , or over some other indexing set? In other words, how many of these weirdly indexed functions $a_{i_1}\cdots\hspace{0.5mm}_{i_k} : A \to \mathbb{R}$ are necessary in order to completely determine $\omega$ ? What the heck is this wedge notation supposed to (as Rudin says) ""symbolically represet?"" It would almost seem to me that $\omega$ is entirely determined by the set $A$ and the functions $a_{i_1}\cdots\hspace{0.5mm}_{i_k}$ , is it not? Do the $\mathrm{d}_{x_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}_{x_k}$ specify a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}^k$ over which the summation is to be taken, or something like that? Again, I'm not familiar with manifolds, nor with tensor products, and Rudin has not developed these subjects, at all. Normally, I prefer rigor to intuition, but as a first step, I'll take what I can get.

61,Uniquely extended fractional iterations of $\exp$,Uniquely extended fractional iterations of,\exp,"Let us define the following basic conditions for an iterated exponential function: $$\exp^1(x)=e^x\tag{$\forall x$}$$ $$\exp^{a+b}(x)=\exp^a(\exp^b(x))\tag{$\forall a,b,x$}$$ I then pondered what sort of additional conditions could be applied. Using the useful inequality $e^x-1\ge x$ , I considered adding the additional constraint: $$\exp^a(x)-a\ge\exp^b(x)-b\tag{$a\ge b$}$$ which can be seen as a reasonable result of inductively applying the inequality. From this, I noticed that: $$0=\exp^0(0)-0\le\exp^a(0)-a\le\exp^1(0)-1=0\tag{$\forall a\in[0,1]$}$$ $$\exp^a(0)=a\tag{$\forall a\in[0,1]$}$$ From this, one can define $\exp^a(0)$ for any $a$ by repeatedly using $$\exp^{a+1}(0)=e^{\exp^a(0)}$$ One can also easily see that this implies $\exp^a(0)$ attains every real value exactly once, meaning it has a well-defined inverse. Now define the super-logarithm: $$x=\operatorname{slog}(\exp^x(0))=\exp^{\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0)$$ and note that we can then write: $$\exp^a(x)=\exp^{a+\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0)$$ which uniquely defines $\exp^a(x)$ . That is to say, we have: $$\exp^a(x)=\begin{cases}a,&x=0\land a\in[0,1]\\\ln(\exp^{a+1}(0)),&x=0\land a<0\\e^{\exp^{a-1}(0)},&x=0\land a>1\\\exp^{a+\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0),&x\ne0\end{cases}$$ One can then check that this satisfies the imposed inequality restriction as well as the functional equation. For the functional equation: $$\exp^a(\exp^b(x))=\exp^{a+\operatorname{slog}(\exp^{b+\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0))}(0)=\exp^{a+b+\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0)=\exp^{a+b}(x)\tag{$x\ne0\land\exp^b(x)\ne0$}$$ The other cases are even simpler to prove. For the inequality: $$\exp^a(0)-a=0\ge0=\exp^b(0)-b\tag{$\forall a,b\in[0,1]$}$$ For $a,b\notin[0,1]$ , the result follows inductively. We can then see that $$\exp^a(x)-a=\exp^{a+\operatorname{slog}(x)}(0)-(a+\operatorname{slog}(x))+\operatorname{slog}(x)$$ and so it follows for all $x$ . What interests me are conditions that do not seem unreasonable or meaningless that lead to similar uniqueness. And so here are my questions: Is there a nice way to extend this to other bases? It seems the inequality for $e$ gets kind of messy if you try to extend it to other bases. And of course I'm not looking for something as trivial as ""just linearly interpolate $\exp_b^a(0)$ for $a\in[0,1]$ with $\exp_b^1(x)=b^x$ .""

98,Wasserstein Distance with Translations,Wasserstein Distance with Translations,,"I am studying this book about Optimal Transport, and in Remark 2.19 it talks about translation in Variance, where it is stated that a nice property of Wasserstein Distances is the ability to factor out translations: $$\mathcal{W}_2 (T_{\tau\#}\alpha \; , \; T_{\tau'\#}\beta)^2= \mathcal{W}_2(\alpha,\beta)^2- 	2\langle \tau -\tau' \; , \; \mathbf{m}_\alpha - \mathbf{m}_\beta \rangle + \|\tau -\tau'\|^2$$ where $\mathbf{m}_\alpha \triangleq \int_\mathcal{X}xd\alpha(x) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the mean of a measure $\alpha$ . The proceeded to write that: $$	\mathcal{W}_2(\alpha,\beta)^2=\mathcal{W}_2(\bar{\alpha},\bar{\beta})^2+\|\mathbf{m}_\alpha - \mathbf{m}_\beta \|^2$$ Where $\mathcal{W}_2(\bar{\alpha},\bar{\beta})^2=\mathcal{W}_2 (T_{\tau\#}\alpha \; , \; T_{\tau'\#}\beta)^2$ . Now, I can't wrap my head around how the term $\|\mathbf{m}_\alpha - \mathbf{m}_\beta \|^2$ came to be in the equation. I've tried to trace backwards, but I got stuck. Here is my attempt: \begin{align} 		2 \langle \tau-\tau',\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\rangle  - \|\tau -\tau'\|^2 &= \|\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\|^2 \\ 		2 \langle \tau-\tau',\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\rangle  &= \|\tau -\tau'\|^2 + \|\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\|^2 \\ 		  \langle \tau-\tau',\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\rangle &= \frac{\|\tau -\tau'\|^2 + \|\mathbf{m}_\alpha-\mathbf{m}_\beta\|^2}{2} \end{align} I haven't studied analysis or measure theory, but I am trying to understand as much as I could. I thought that this is an inner product and that $\tau-\tau'$ is the difference between translations, which could be viewed as some vector, and similarly for the difference between the means of the discrete measures which I assume that they yield the center of the discrete measures $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . I am pretty sure something is wrong in my understanding, or at least my basics. So, my questions are: where did I go wrong? is that an inner product? what is the definition of this $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ notation? and what is the definition of these norms $\|\cdot\|^2$ in the context of the Wasserstein distances?

Given that $C$ is convex, this is equivalent to just saying that $x + αv ∈ C$ for some $α > 0$ . A point $x ∈ C$ is internal iff it is $v$ -internal for every $v ∈ V$ .
