I'll give the problem and my attempt at a solution. Part A : Given a $3\times3\times3$ cube $C$ containing $28$ points. Prove that some pair of points is within $\sqrt{3}$ of each other. Part B : Describe a distribution of $27$ points in $C$ such that every point is more than $\sqrt{3}$ from each other point. Part A was simple: Begin by partitioning $C$ into $27\;1\times1\times1$ cubes. Picture a Rubik's cube: Then, by the pigeonhole principle, one small cube must contain $2$ points. The distance between these two points is at most $\sqrt{3}$ (since the largest Euclidean distance in the small cube is between opposite vertices, which is $\sqrt{1^2+1^2+1^2} = \sqrt{3}$ ). Therefore, some pair of points is within $\sqrt{3}$ of each other. Part B was less simple. On the test, I claimed that $14$ is the greatest number of points which can be packed into $C$ while satisfying the condition: Put one point on each of the vertices of $C$ for a total of $8$ points. If you draw a $3\times3$ square with circles of radius $\sqrt{3}$ coming off each vertex, you will see that there is only a small area not within any circle. This region includes the center of the square. This picture represents a view of any face of $C$ so far. Then, put one point on the center of each face of $C$ for $6$ more points. These points are legal. Based on our previous diagram, each face of $C$ cannot hold any more points. But can the very center? No. The distance from the center of $C$ to the center of any of its faces is $1.5$ . We have now placed $14$ points. I believe we placed them with an optimal strategy, so I think that $15$ (and everything greater) is impossible. My attempt at Part B does not rigorously prove that $14$ is the maximum, so my questions are: Is this task possible with $27$ points? If so, how? If not, what is the maximum, and how can you prove it?","This problem comes from a math test which I've already completed. I'll give the problem and my attempt at a solution.

Factoring $10^{900}-2^{1000} = 2^{900}(5^{450}+2^{50})(5^{225}+2^{25})(5^{225}-2^{25})$ reduces the problem to seeing if $997$ divides any of the above terms, but that didn't seem to help much either as again, the numbers involved are so large.

As it so happens, this claim turned out to be true which yields the desired result by setting $k=100$.  Giving him the claim as a clue, he was able to proceed.

Here is the Definition of Pumping Lemma: If A is a regular language, then there is a number p (the pumping length) where, if s is any string in A of length at least p, then s may be divided into three pieces, s = xyz, satisfying the following conditions: for each $i \ge 0$, $xy^iz\in A$, $|y| > 0$ $|xy|\le p$ Now while explaining why the classic language $B=\{0^n1^n\mid n \ge 0\}$, is not a regular, Sipser gives the following explanations: Assume the contrary is regular, assume $B$ is regular. Let $p$ be the pumping length given by the pumping lemma. Choose $s$ to be the string $0^p1^p$. Because $s\in B$ and $s$ has length more than $p$, the pumping lemma guarantees that $s$ can be split into three pieces, $s=xyz$, where for any $i\ge 0$ the string $xy^iz\in B$. However, these cases make this impossible (causing a contradiction): Case 1 . The string $y$ consists only of $0$s. In this case the string $xyyz$ has more $0$s than $1$s and so it is not a member of $B$, violating condition 1 of the pumping lemma.

A tube cannot contain more than $4$ doses of liquid. There are exactly $4$ doses of each liquid. Liquids of different colors are non-miscible. The goal is to move liquids so that the $4$ doses of each liquid are in a single tube. Only the doses of liquid on the top of a tube can be moved. They have to be moved on top of a liquid of the same color. All doses of the same color at the top have to be moved at the same time. The only exception is when there is not enough space available when moving into a new tube. Only the doses of the same color that can be moved are then moved. For example, imagine that tube 1 contains three red doses and tube 2 contains a red dose above a blue one. In that case, two red doses from tube 1 can be moved to tube 2.

I'm trying to figure out when we actually need to use 'such that' in math/logical expressions. There seems to be quite a bit of inconsistency but I wanted to check to be sure. I've seen 3 ways of doing it... My discrete mathematics professor IIRC always used a 'such that' after an existential qualifier but not after a universal qualifier... so he'd use ∃x ∈ N: x > 1, but then also ∀x ∈ N, x > 0 (I think he'd use a comma here) These guys and a couple others I've seen online use no punctuation unless indicating parentheses: What does a period in between quantifiers mean? But others still use 'such that' (:) before all qualifiers: Does order of qualifiers matter in FOL formula? I believe my math professor did what he did because it translated cleanly to English. Since you'd say ""There exists an x such that x > 3"" but you could also say ""For all x, x=x"". But I'm trying to figure out what the 'such that' symbol actually means in math, because I don't think the way it works in English necessarily makes sense. Wolfram Alpha defines the 'such that' symbol as 'indicating a condition in the definition of a mathematical object', and this make sense but they introduce yet another convention of qualifiers after a such that since q∈Z ≡ ∀q∈Z. And of course this convention makes no sense when translated to English in the case when for example when we'd say ""x > 3: ∃x ∈ N"" which translates to ""x is greater than three such that there exists an x in naturals"". So anyways my question is what are you actually supposed to do? It looks like there are multiple conventions so which is best and most commonly used? 10/9/18 EDIT: The Root of the Problem: I've realized that the source of all this inconsistency has to do with the way that we read an existential qualifier. We read it as ""there exists a blank [in something] [such that...]"", and still call it a qualifier while technically this 'qualifier' is actually an (English) statement . We could similarly distort a universal qualifier to be a statement that is post-qualified with a ""such that"", if we read it as ""All blank [in something] have a property [such that...]"".

I always thought once a theorem is proven it would never be disproven but again I am not an expert. The article is the following: https://gizmodo.com/remarkable-mathematical-proof-describes-how-to-solve-se-1841003769 I do not know what the rules are for allowing me to enter a link so maybe I will write the part of the article in quotes to illustrate the point as follows: Computer scientists are buzzing about a new mathematical proof that proposes a quantum-entangled system sort of like the one described above. It seems to disprove a 44-year-old conjecture and details a theoretical machine capable of solving the famous halting problem, which says a computer cannot determine whether it will ever be able to solve a problem it’s currently trying to solve. The 150-page proof, titled simply “MIP*=RE,” deals in the esoteric subject of computational complexity. If it holds under scrutiny, it demonstrates a profound connection between quantum physics, computation, and mathematics. It shows that a theoretical class of computing devices—a verifier interrogating the quantum-entangled oracles—can check some of the most complex computer problems imaginable. The last paragraph is beyond my understanding with the level of math that I have but what disturbes me is that I always believed once a proof was shown to be true it could not be disproven. The halting problem is related to Godel's incompeteness theorem and I know Godel's Theorem has also been proven to be true. I thought perhaps someone who is expert could comment on this.

This is what I am trying to prove. I have a feeling that it would be using the pigeon hole principle but I just cannot figure it out. This is what I found interesting so far: There are 90 2-digits numbers ([10,99]), which means that there are exactly 45 even numbers, which means that in a set with 46 numbers, there must be at least one odd number. Though I do not know what to make of that... Also, 46 is optimal, in the snse that there exists a set of 45 distinct 2-digit numbers so that no two distinct numbers are relatively prime.","Prove that any set of 46 distinct 2-digit numbers contains two distinct numbers which are relatively prime.

I know to give a big O estimate, first I have to find the dominant term. In this case, after getting rid of slow increasing terms and simplifying, I am here: $$\frac{x^3\log_2(x)}{2}+\frac{x^3}{2}$$ Then I can factor a $x^3$ out of the two fractions which I think is dominant term, so then the Big O estimate would be $O(x^3)$. Is this correct? I am mainly confused because of the $\log x$ in the function towards the end.
