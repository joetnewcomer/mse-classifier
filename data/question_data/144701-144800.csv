Now assume that $X$ is not Hausdorff then $\exists x \neq y$ such that they cannot be seperated by disjoint open neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$ Now because $X$ is first-countable then there exists a sequence of decreasing neighborhoods $U_i$ of $x$ and $V_i$ of $y$ such that $U_i \cap V_j \neq \phi$ , in particular $U_i \cap V_i \neq \phi$ , choose $z_i\in U_i \cap V_i$ , then the sequence $( z_i) $ converges to both $x$ snd $y$ .

Does this mean that $x_n$ also converges? If so, proof that it is convergent, otherwise provide a counterexample. First of all, let's define $y_n = x_n^2 - 2x_n - 15 +4^{-n}$, as $n \to \infty \Rightarrow y_n = x_n^2 - 2x_n - 15 $. Assume $\lim y_n = a$, then $a = x_n^2 - 2x_n - 15$. This equation gives two roots: $x_n = 1 + \sqrt{4a + 16}$ and $x_n = 1 - \sqrt{4a + 16}$. And we know that both of them should be $>0$, since $x_n > 0$. From $1 - \sqrt{4a + 16} > 0$, we get $-4 \leq a < \frac{-15}{4}$. So $y_n$ converges, when $x_n$ is either $1 - \sqrt{4a + 16}$ or $1 + \sqrt{4a + 16}$. So I can take $x_n = \{ 1 - \sqrt{4a + 16}, 1 + \sqrt{4a + 16}, 1 - \sqrt{4a + 16}, 1 + \sqrt{4a + 16}, \dotso \}$, so $y_n$ still converges, while $x_n$ is not. Also if $1 - \sqrt{4a + 16} = 1 + \sqrt{4a + 16}$, then $x_n$ also converges. Despite all my thoughts, I'm pretty sure that this solution have some mistakes, for example, I'm not sure that I can cancel out $4^{-n}$.","For some sequence $x_n > 0$, we know that sequence $x_n^2 - 2x_n - 15 +4^{-n}$ converges.
