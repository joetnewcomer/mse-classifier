11,Addition of Permutations,Addition of Permutations,,"Sorry, if the title doesn't provide any clarity, but I didn't really know how to call it. Anyways, I've been studying quantum field theory from Blundell's book and during the derivation of the formula for second quantizing an operator I'm getting a little bit confused about a step he makes. I'll walk you through: We first write down an expression of an $N$ -particle state $$\left|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_P\xi^P\prod_{i=1}^N\left|\psi_{P(i)}\right>$$ where the sum is taken over all $N!$ permutations of the single particle states $\left|\psi_i\right>$ . We take $\xi=+1$ for bosons while $\xi=-1$ is for fermions. Now, the inner product of two such states (either both boson states or fermion states) is: $$\left<\chi_1\cdots\chi_N|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\frac1{N!}\sum_P\sum_Q\xi^{P+Q}\prod_{i=1}\left<\chi_{Q(i)}|\psi_{P(i)}\right>\label{before}\qquad (1)$$ Then comes the confusing part. The author says that we can rewrite the above expression using $P'=P+Q$ which spans all the permutations $N!$ times and hence: $$\left<\chi_1\cdots\chi_N|\psi_1\cdots\psi_N\right>=\sum_{P'}\xi^{P'}\prod_{i=1}^N\left<\chi_i|\psi_{P'(i)}\right>\qquad (2)$$ Writting down examples for $N=2$ and $N=3$ I can see what he means and then the generalisation seems kind of intuitive. So for $N=2$ one would write down the 2-particle state as: $$\left|\psi_1\psi_2\right>=\frac1{\sqrt{2!}}(\xi^{\sigma_0}\left|\psi_1\right>\left|\psi_2\right>+\xi^{\sigma_1}\left|\psi_2\right>\left|\psi_1\right>)$$ Where $\sigma_0=i,\sigma_1\in S_2$ (the elements of the symmetry group). Then the inner product with another state $\left|\chi_1\chi_2\right>$ would be: $$ \frac12(\xi^{\sigma_0+\sigma_0}\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right> + +\xi^{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right> +\xi^{\sigma_1+\sigma_0}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right> +\xi^{\sigma_1+\sigma_1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right>)$$ $$ =\frac122(\xi^0\left<\chi_1|\psi_2\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_1\right>+\xi^{1}\left<\chi_1|\psi_1\right>\left<\chi_2|\psi_2\right>) $$ So, as it seems to me, for $N=2$ : $$\sigma_0+\sigma_0=\sigma_1+\sigma_1=\sigma_1$$ $$\sigma_0+\sigma_1=\sigma_1+\sigma_0=\sigma_0$$ However, the author from the example of $N=3$ seems to have defined in general for $\sigma_n,\sigma_m\in S_3$ $$\sigma_n+\sigma_m=\sigma_{(n+m)mod(3!)}$$ Well, now to make my confusion a bit more precise, Why is there a disagreement with my definition of addition and the authors one. Is it maybe because he might consider $\sigma_1$ for example a different permutation in the symmetry group?

13,Showing the rank of a group $H$ is precisely the maximal rank $\alpha$ of a sequence of groups.,Showing the rank of a group  is precisely the maximal rank  of a sequence of groups.,H \alpha,"I'm working with an inverse limit of groups and I'm trying to prove some property. Let $F_n$ be the free group of rank $n$ . We have a morphism from $f_n:F_n\to F_{n-1}$ that sends a word in $F_n$ to the word in $F_{n-1}$ with the instances of the $n$ -th generator removed, it is surjective and by composing those morphism we have $\cdots\to F_n\to F_{n-1}\to \cdots \to F_2\to F_1$ . We define $F$ as the inverse limit of this system, that is $F=\left\lbrace (w_n)_n\in\prod_i F_i \;\vert \;f_n(w_n)=w_{n-1}\right\rbrace$ . My goal is to show that if $H$ is a finitely generated subgroup of $F$ then $H$ is free. I think I have the proof, there's just one detail that I can't quite figure out. For each $n$ we have a projection $p_n:F\to F_n$ , so let $H$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $F$ we define for each $n$ a group $H_n=p_n(H)<F_n$ . Since subgroups of free groups are free, each $H_n$ is free. I've shown that these free groups $H_n$ have a maximal rank $\alpha$ , and that there is an $i_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $i\geq i_0$ the rank of $H_i$ is precisely $\alpha$ . So for $i\geq i_0$ , the groups $H_i$ are the same (up to isomorphism since there's essentially one free group of each rank) and since finitely generated free group are Hopfian, the morphisms $f_n:H_n\to H_{n-1}$ (restricted to $H_n$ ) are isomorphisms. This allows us to show that $x\in H$ is solely determined by its image in $H_{i_0}$ . So taking $B\subset H$ that is mapped to a free basis for $H_{i_0}$ by $p_{i_0}$ , we can find a free basis for H and we're done. I've glossed over a bunch of details that are irrelevant to the question I'm about to ask but this is to give an idea of the context.

And since the rest of the proof sort of relies on it, it would help if I could prove it. Maybe something is wrong but I think it's supposed to work. At first I sort of hand waved it assuming filling in the details would be easy, but the more I think about it the less I know how to do it. I tried assuming $rank H > \alpha$ and then finding a contradiction to the fact that the morphism $f_i$ is an isomorphism (for $i\geq i_0$ ) but I didn't succeed. Not quite sure where to go from there. EDIT: for clarification, the groups $H_n$ 's rank is bounded by the rank of $H$ and its increasing with $n$ (or stationary) so it converges towards some $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$ .

(Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, vol. XXVI, p. 325-338, 1895; The Collected Papers of William Burnside, vol. 1, p. 589-596.) It is the paper where Burnside proves that a finite non-abelian simple group with even order has order divisible by 12, by 16 or by 56. From p. 591 of the Collected Papers, seventh line by the end, Burnsides assumes that (hyp. 1) $G$ is a finite group whose Sylow 2-subgroups are of order 8; (hyp. 2) if $P$ is a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$ , two elements of $P$ are conjugate in $G$ only if they are conjugate in $P$ and he announces that he will prove that G is not simple. Note that if the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are abelian, hyp. 2 is equivalent to say that for every Sylow 2-subgroup $P$ of $G$ , $N_{G}(P) = C_{G}(P)$ , thus, in this case, the non-simplicity of $G$ is today an easy consequence of Burnside's transfer theorem. But, in his 1895 paper, Burnside doesn't use his transfer theorem (I presume that he had not yet found it) and I would like to understand his reasonings. It could be a good little work on the history of mathematics. At the start of his paper, Burnside proved that if the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are cyclic, then $G$ is not simple. Thus, if we assume that the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are abelian, we are left with two cases : (i) the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are isomorphic to $C_{2} \times C_{2} \times C_{2}$ ; (ii) the Sylow 2-subgroups of $G$ are isomorphic to $C_{2} \times C_{4}$ . I understand Burnside's proof (that $G$ is not simple) for case (i), but not for case (ii). Here is his proof (p. 593 in the Collected Papers, vol. I) for case (ii) : ""If next, the sub-groups of order $2^{3}$ are of of type (ii), and if the main group contains 3 distinct sets of conjugate operations of order 2, one of these sets contains exclusively operations which are the squares of operations od order 4, and the other two sets those that are not. Let, now, $A$ be on operation of order 2 which is the square of an operation of order 4, and let $B$ an operation of order 2 belonging to a different conjugate set from $A$ . Then $A$ and $B$ must generate a dihedral group of order $4n$ , where $n$ is odd. Suppose [why ""suppose"" ? Isn't it necessarily true ?] that $AB$ is an operation of this group of order $2n$ , and write $(AB)^{n}= C$ , $(AB)^{2}=S_{n}$ , so that $C$ is an operation of order 2, and $S_{n}$ an operation of order $n$ . The operation $C$ must clearly belong to a different conjugate set from both $A$ and $B$ . Now $A S_{n} A = S_{n}^{-1}, B S_{n} B = S_{n}^{-1}, C S_{n} C = S_{n}$ ."" So far, so good. (Instead of ""operation of a group"", read ""element of a group"", and instead of ""conjugate set of operations"", read ""conjugacy class of elements"".) A complete proof of the preceding results is a bit long, but I can give it if anyone asks for it. Then Burnsides says : ""If $A^{1}$ is any operation contained in the sub-group within which the cyclical sub-group generated by $S_{n}$ is self-conjugate, and belonging to the same conjugate set as A [I understand : if $A^{1}$ is any $G$ -conjugate of $A$ belonging to $N_{G}(<S_{n}>)$ ], then $A^{1} S_{n} A^{1} = S_{n}^{-1}$ ,"" Why ? How do we know that we don't have, for example, $A^{1} S_{n} A^{1} = S_{n}$ ? I copy the rest of Burnsides's proof : ""and, therefore, $S_{n}$ cannot certainly be permutable [read : commute] with any operation of order 4, since it is not permutable with the square of any such operation. The operation $S_{n}$ therefore forms one of a set of $4r$ conjugate operations, where $r$ is odd; [I read : the number of $G$ -conjugates of $S_{n}$ is $4r$ , where $r$ is odd;] and, when these are transformed by any operation of order 4, the resulting substitution [read : permutation] of the permutation-group consists of $r$ cycles of 4 symbols each. This is an odd substitution, and, therefore, again, in this case, the group cannot be simple."" I agree that $S_{n}$ commutes with no element of order 4 of $G$ (I can give a proof if anybody asks), but I don't see how Burnside can say that the number of $G$ -conjugates of $S_{n}$ is $4r$ , where $r$ is odd.

21,Groups acting on semigroups,Groups acting on semigroups,,"Suppose $G$ is a group and $S$ is a semigroup (a set with an associative binary operation). Just as in Groups acting on groups , say a group action of $G$ on $S$ is sensible if $g * (ss') = (g * s)(g * s')$ for all $g \in G$ and $s, s' \in S$ . What are some properties of groups acting (sensibly) on semigroups that are not always true of groups acting on sets? Here is one idea I stumbled upon. Suppose that $F$ is a field and $G$ is a group acting on a semigroup $S$ . There is a corresponding linear permutation representation of $G$ on the semigroup ring $F[S]$ ( $G$ acts by permuting the basis vectors: $g * \sum_{s \in S} c_s \vec{e}_s := \sum_s c_s \vec{e}_{g * s} = \sum_s c_{g^{-1} * s} \vec{e}_s$ ). If $G$ acts sensibly on $S$ , then the linear representation also respects multiplication: $g * (v w) = (g * v)(g * w)$ for all vectors $v, w \in F[S]$ . There is a neat consequence of this result. $S_n$ plainly acts on $[n] := \{ 1, 2, \dots, n\}$ , so there is a corresponding linear permutation representation of $S_n$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ : $\sigma * (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) := (x_{\sigma^{-1}(1)}, x_{\sigma^{-1}(2)}, \dots, x_{\sigma^{-1}(n)})$ . Of course, $S_n$ acts in the same way on $\mathbb{N}^n$ and continues to respect the addition operation of $\mathbb{N}^n$ , so there is a corresponding linear permutation representation of $S_n$ on $F[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$ as $\sigma * h(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = h(x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, \dots, x_{\sigma(n)})$ .

I think it's awesome that this works out.) Thanks to the preceding paragraph, $\sigma * (fh) = (\sigma * f)(\sigma * h)$ for all $f, h \in F[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$ . Thus $\sigma$ corresponds not only to an invertible linear operator on $F[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$ , but also a ring automorphism that fixes $F$ .

I have been trying to show the existence of an identity in $S$ on $*$ as I think the rest will follow, but I cannot seem to make any progress. My work so far is not very solid, but it is an attempt to show that there is at least one $e$ exists such that $$a ∗ e = e ∗ a = b, \text{ where }a,b\in S$$ Reasoning as follows: From the problem statement: $$∀ (a, b) ∈ S × S\ ∃ (c, d) ∈ S × S:\ a*c = d*a = b$$ I would like to show that at least one such $(a, b)$ has $c = d$ . I try a proof by contradiction: Assume $$∀ (a, b) ∈ S × S\ \exists (c, d) ∈ S × S\ c ≠ d:\ a*c = d*a = b$$ Since $S$ is finite, so let $|S| = n$ . $$\therefore|S × S| = n^2$$ But there are $n(n-1)$ pairs of the form $(c, d) ∈ S × S$ such that $c ≠ d$ . From here I am trying to use the pigeonhole principle to show that there exists $(a,x)$ and $(b,y)$ such that $$(a = b\text{ and }x ≠ y)\text{ or }(x = y\text{ and }a ≠ b)$$ that satisfy $$a*c = c*a = x$$ $$b*c = c*b = y$$ leading to an obvious contradiction. I think there is a way to derive this existence, since intuitively there are $n$ ""excess"" pairs after relating pairs $(a, b)$ one-to-one with pairs $(c, d)$ . I would greatly appreciate a hint.

Could someone look it over to tell me if there are any holes? I don't know if my proof of surjectivity is the best way to go about it. It almost feels like ""cheating."" I claim that $\phi: S_3 \to \mathrm{Aut}(S_3)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g (x) = gxg^{-1}$ is an isomorphism. In general, $\phi: G \to \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ sending $g \longmapsto c_g$ is a homomorphism, so it suffices to show that $\phi$ is a bijection. We have: \begin{align*} g \in \mathrm{ker}(\phi) & \iff \phi(g) = c_g (x) = x, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff gxg^{-1} = x, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff gx = xg, \; \forall x \in G \\ & \iff g \in Z(G) = \{e\}, \end{align*} so the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial, so $\phi$ is injective. Since $S_3$ has exactly $6$ elements which must be sent to distinct elements of the ${\rm Aut}(S_3)$ , this implies that $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| \leq 6$ . I claim that $\phi$ is also surjective. We have $S_3 = \langle a = (12), b = (13), c = (23) \rangle$ , each of which has order $2$ . Since an automorphism $f \in{\rm Aut}(S_3)$ must preserve the order of elements, $f$ must send transpositions to transpositions. Furthermore, upon fixing where $f$ send these transpositions, the rest of the map is determined. Since there are $3!$ possibilities for where to send the permutations and these are the only possible automorphisms, we have $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| \leq 6$ . Hence, $|{\rm Aut}(S_3)| = 6$ .

Striving for a contradiction, suppose that neither $G$ has a unique Sylow $r$ -subgroup, nor does $Z(G)$ have an element of order $q$ . By the third part of Sylow's Theorem, $n_r \equiv 1\pmod{r}$ and $n_r \in \{1,p,q,q^2,pq,pq^2\}$ . By our assumption that $G$ does not have a unique Sylow $r$ -subgroup, we cannot have $n_r = 1$ .

Then $[G:N_G(R)] = n_r = pq$ implies $|N_G(R)| = qr$ . Since $Z(G) \leq N_G(R)$ , we must have $|Z(G)|$ divides $qr$ . Thus $|Z(G)| \in \{1,r\}$ .

33,(Yet) Another attempt at embedding free group on three letters inside a free group on two letters,(Yet) Another attempt at embedding free group on three letters inside a free group on two letters,,"This question could have been asked by several users. Here is my attempt. This could possibly be completely in the wrong direction. So I attempt to show $F(\{x,y,z\}) $ is a subgroup of $F(\{a,b\})$ . My intention is to exploit the universal mapping property (UMP) (and it could be in the wrong direction but anyway I'll give it a try for reasons stated below). To begin with, we have the natural injection $i:\{x,y,z\}\to F(\{x,y,z\})$ s.t $i(x)=x,i(y)=y,i(z)=z$ and the map $f:\{x,y,z\}\to F(\{a,b\})$ given by $f(x)=a^2,f(y)=ab,f(z)=b^2$ . So by UMP of $F(\{x,y,z\})$ there is a unique $\phi: F(\{x,y,z\})\to F(\{a,b\})$ (homomorphism) such that $f=\phi \circ i$ i.e $\phi(x)=a^2,\, \phi(y)=ab,\, \phi(z)=b^2$ . So $F(\{x,y,z\})/ker(\phi)$ is (isomorphic to) a subgroup of $F(\{a,b\})$ and hence free. So can we conclude from this that $ker(\phi)$ is trivial ?? We will be done if this happens. A more general question (possibly wrong) can be formulated as follows : If $\psi : F(X)\to F(Y)$ is a surjective homomorphism between free groups, is $ker(\psi)$ trivial ?? (Edit): So may be a better way to formulate the general question would be : If $F(X)$ is a free group and a factor group $F(X)/N$ is also free then does that imply the normal subgroup $N$ to be trivial ?? I am having a feeling that the answer to this question is in affirmative but I am nowhere near a solution. P.S: There could be some possible directions to prove this using fundamental groups, but my algebraic topology is quite rusty (hence didn't tag it) so I would prefer algebraic attempts.

We have a set $S$ , and $n$ operations $\times_0,\times_1,\times_2,\cdots,\times_{n-1}$ on $S$ . Each operation $\times_k$ is commutative, is associative, has an identity $e_k\in S$ , and distributes over the previous operation $\times_{k-1}$ . Also, the identities are all distinct. Denote $S_k=S\setminus\{e_0,e_1,e_2,\cdots,e_{k-1}\}$ (understanding that $S_0=S$ , etc.). The whole structure is called an $n$ -field if it has some further properties. Given the above properties, are (some combinations of) the following further properties equivalent? $(1)$ Each $\times_k$ is invertible in the sense that, for any $a\in S_k$ , there exists $b\in S$ such that $a\times_kb=e_k$ . $(2)$ Each $\times_k$ is invertible in the sense that, for any $a\in S_k$ , there exists $b\in S_k$ such that $a\times_kb=e_k$ . $(3)$ Each identity is null with respect to the higher operations; for any $k<l$ and any $a\in S_k$ , $e_k\times_la=e_k$ . $(4)$ Recursively, both of the structures $(S_0,\times_0,\times_1,\cdots,\times_{n-2},e_0,e_1,\cdots,e_{n-2})$ and $(S_1,\times_1,\times_2,\cdots,\times_{n-1},e_1,e_2,\cdots,e_{n-1})$ are $(n-1)$ -fields. (And a $1$ -field is an abelian group.) $(5)$ All $(n-1)$ of the structures $(S_k,\times_k,\times_{k+1},e_k,e_{k+1})$ are fields. (Or if $n=1$ the structure is an abelian group.) Clearly $(2)$ implies $(1)$ , and $(1)$ and $(3)$ together imply $(2)$ . Ideally, I want $(1)$ alone to imply all the others. To prove $(4)$ for the second structure (the first is easy), we'd only need to show that $S_1$ is closed under $\times_1,\times_2,\cdots,\times_{n-1}$ ; that is, if $a\neq e_0\neq b$ , then $a\times_kb\neq e_0$ . But this follows from $(3)$ and invertibility. My linked question proves that $(1)$ implies the others in the case $n=3$ , and shows that no $n$ -field exists for $n>4$ provided that it's true for $n=4$ . So let's focus on $4$ -fields, and assume property $(1)$ . We know that the sub-structure $(S_0,\times_0,\times_1,\times_2,e_0,e_1,e_2)$ is a $3$ -field, which implies, for all $a\in S$ , $$e_0\times_0a=e_1\times_1a=e_2\times_2a=a,$$ $$e_0\times_1a=e_0\times_2a=e_0,$$ $$a\neq e_0\implies e_1\times_2a=e_1.$$ The last two lines are property $(3)$ for this sub-structure. To complete $(3)$ , we need to consider the final operation $\times_3$ : $$e_0\times_3a\overset?=e_0,$$ $$a\neq e_0\overset?\implies e_1\times_3a=e_1,$$ $$e_0\neq a\neq e_1\overset?\implies e_2\times_3a=e_2.$$ For the last one, defining $x=e_2\times_3a$ and using the given algebraic laws, $$e_2\times_3a=(e_2\times_2e_2)\times_3a=(e_2\times_3a)\times_2(e_2\times_3a),$$ we see that $x=x\times_2x$ is its own square. If $x\in S_2$ (meaning it's not $e_0$ or $e_1$ ), then it's $\times_2$ -invertible, and dividing gives $e_2=x$ . If instead $x=e_0$ or $e_1$ , then $$a=a\times_3e_3=a\times_3(e_3\times_2e_2)=(a\times_3e_3)\times_2(a\times_3e_2)=a\times_2x,$$ so we get $a=a\times_2e_0=e_0$ , or $a=a\times_2e_1=e_1$ , a contradiction. Therefore $x=e_2\times_3a=e_2$ . In fact we can prove $(2)$ from $(1)$ , at least in the case $n=4$ . We already know that $\times_0,\times_1,\times_2$ are invertible on their respective spaces $S_0,S_1,S_2$ . It remains to consider $a\in S_3$ : is its $\times_3$ -inverse $b$ also in $S_3$ ? Suppose contrarily that $b=e_0$ , $e_1$ , or $e_2$ . Then, from the known properties of $3$ -fields, $b=b\times_2b$ , and thus $$e_3=a\times_3b=a\times_3(b\times_2b)=(a\times_3b)\times_2(a\times_3b)=e_3\times_2e_3;$$ but $e_3\in S_2$ is invertible; dividing gives $e_2=e_3$ , a contradiction.

Let's see what happens. If $|G'|=p$ , then $|G/G'|=q$ and therefore there are $q$ linear characters of $G$ . Hence $\sum_{\chi\in Irr(G)}\chi(1)^2=|G|$ implies that $q+\sum_{\chi\in Irr(G),\chi(1)\neq 1}\chi(1)^2=pq$ . We know that $\chi(1)|pq$ and so if $\chi(1)\neq 1$ it should be $\chi(1)=p$ or $\chi(1)=q$ or $\chi(1)=pq$ . Since $q<p$ , it is easily seen that for all $\chi$ (that are not of degree 1) we necessarily have $\chi(1)=q$ .

65,Question on Artin Proof of The Classification of The Groups of Order $12$,Question on Artin Proof of The Classification of The Groups of Order,12,"In the book Algebra Ed2 by Michael Artin, in chapter 7.8 where Artin classifies the groups of order $12$ , he considers a Sylow $3$ -subgroup $K$ and a Sylow $2$ -subgroup $H$ of order $4$ . Then $K\approx C_3$ and $H\approx C_4$ or $H\approx C_2\times C_2$ . Therefore $H\cap K=1$ , and then $HK=G$ as the product map is bijective. He proved that at least one of $H$ and $K$ is a normal subgroup, and consider them case by case. In Case 3, when $K$ is normal, but $H$ is not, he writes: Then $H$ operates by conjugation on $K = \left\{1,y,y^2\right\}$ . Since $H$ is not normal, it contains an element $x$ that doesn't commute with $y$ , and then $xyx^{-1} = y^2$ . Why must it be true that an element of $x$ in $H$ does not commute with $y$ ?

Herstein, 2nd edition: In Problem 14 show by an example that if one just assumed one of the cancellation laws, then the conclusion need not hold. My Attempt: Let $$ G = \{ \, 1, -1 \, \}. $$ And for any $a, b \in G$ , let $a * b$ be defined as $$ a*b \colon= a \, \lvert b \rvert. $$ Thus we have $$ 1 * 1 = 1 = 1 * (-1), \qquad (-1)*1 = -1 = (-1) * (-1). $$ We note that in this set $G$ with this binary operation $*$ , the left cancellation law does not hold, for although we have $$ 1 * 1 = 1 = 1 * (-1), $$ it is not true that $$ 1 = -1.$$ However, the right cancellation law does indeed hold in $G$ , for if $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ are any elements in $G$ and if $$ a * c = b * c, $$ then we have $$ a \, \lvert c \rvert = b \, \lvert c \rvert, $$ and since $c \neq 0$ , therefore we must have $$ a = b. $$ Thus in our set $G$ with this particular binary operation $*$ , the right cancellation law holds but the left cancellation law does not. Moreover, for any elements $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ in $G$ , we obtain $$ \begin{align} (a * b) * c &= \big(a \, \lvert b \rvert \big) * c \\ &= \big(a \, \lvert b \rvert \big) \, \lvert c \rvert \\ &= a \, \lvert b c \rvert \\ &= a \, \big\lvert b \, \lvert c \rvert \, \big\rvert \\ &= a \, \big\lvert \, b * c  \, \big\rvert \\ &= a * ( b * c). \end{align} $$ This shows that $*$ is an associative binary operation on $G$ . Thus $G$ is a finite set with an associative binary operation $*$ such that only one of the two cancellation laws holds in $G$ . Finally, we note that this set $G$ with this particular binary operation $*$ is not a group, because $G$ contains no identity element. In order to see that $G$ with respect to $*$ contains no identity element, we note that as $$ 1 * (-1) \neq -1, $$ so $1$ cannot be an identity element (more precisely a left identity element) of $G$ , and as $$ (-1) * 1  \neq 1, $$ so $-1$ cannot be an identity element (more precisely, a left identity element) of $G$ . On the other hand, either of $1$ and $-1$ can serve as a right identity element in $G$ , because for any element $a \in G$ , we have $$ a * (\pm 1) = a \, \lvert \pm 1 \rvert = a (1) = a. $$ However, in a group a right identity element is also a left identity element, and there is a unique such element. See Lemma 2.3.1 a. in Herstein. And, also refer to this Mathematics Stack Exchange post. Is this example good enough? If so, then is my presentation clear enough too? Or, are there any issues? Now let us consider this same set $G$ , namely, $$ G = \{ \, 1, -1 \, \}, $$ but now let $*$ be the binary operation on $G$ defined as follows: For any elements $a$ and $b$ of $G$ , let us define $a ~ b$ as $$ a*b \colon= \lvert a \rvert \, b. $$ Then we have $$ 1 * 1 = 1 = (-1) * 1, \qquad 1 * (-1) = -1 = (-1) * (-1).  $$ In this case, the left cancellation law holds in $G$ , for if $a, b, c \in G$ and if $$ a * b = a * c, $$ then $$ \lvert a \rvert \, b = \lvert a \rvert \, c, $$ and as $a \neq 0$ , so we must have $b = c$ , but the right does not hold in $G$ , for we have $$ 1 * 1 = (-1) * 1, $$ but $1 \neq -1$ . And, this binary operation $*$ on $G$ is of course associative, for if $a, b, c \in G$ , then we obtain $$ \begin{align} a * ( b * c ) &= a * \big( \lvert b \rvert \, c \big) \\ &= \lvert a \rvert \, \big( \lvert b \rvert \, c \big) \\ &= \lvert a \rvert \, \lvert b \rvert \, c \\ &= \lvert a b \rvert \, c \\ &= \big\lvert a \, \lvert b \rvert \big\rvert \, c \\ &= \big\lvert a * b \big\rvert \, c \\ &= (a * b) *c. \end{align} $$ Thus again we have the finite set $G$ with an associative binary operation such that only one of the two cancellation laws holds in $G$ . Finally, we note that this set $G$ with this particular binary operation $*$ is again not a group. The element $1$ of $G$ cannot serve as an identity element (from the right) because $(-1) * 1 \neq -1$ , and $-1$ cannot serve as an identity element (again from the right) because $1 * (-1) \neq 1$ , although either of $1$ and $-1$ can serve as an identity element from the left, because for any element $a \in G$ have $$ (\pm 1 ) * a = \lvert \pm 1 \rvert \, a = 1 \cdot a = a. $$ Is this example OK?

My question is as follows: Questions: For any group $G$ , the absolute center $L(G)$ of $G$ is defined as $$L(G) = \lbrace g\in G\mid \alpha(g)=g,\forall\alpha\in Aut(G) \rbrace,$$ where $Aut(G)$ denote the group of all automorphisms of $G$ . An automorphism $\alpha$ of $G$ is called an absolute central automorphism if $g^{-1}\alpha(g)\in L(G)$ for all $g\in G$ . Let $Var(G)$ denote the group of all absolute central automorphisms of $G$ . Let $$C_{Aut(G)}(Var(G))= \lbrace \alpha\in Aut(G)\mid\alpha\beta = \beta\alpha, \forall\beta \in Var(G)\rbrace$$ denote the centralizer of $Var(G)$ in $Aut(G)$ . Let $$E(G)=[G,C_{Aut(G)}(Var(G))]=\langle g^{-1}\alpha(g)\mid g\in G, \alpha\in C_{Aut(G)}(Var(G))\rangle.$$ One can easily see that $E(G)$ is a characteristic subgroup of $G$ containing the derived group $G^{\prime}=[G,Inn(G)]$ . How to calculate $E(G)$ in GAP? I already have code which calculates $L(G)$ . Will this be helpful for calculating $E(G)$ ?

Exercise 2.10 (a) Show that $\mathrm{PSL}(2,5)$ fails to have a Hall subgroup of some admissible order. (b) Show that $\mathrm{PSL}(2,7)$ has non-conjugate Hall subgroups of the same order. (c) Show that $\mathrm{PSL}(2,11)$ has non-isomorphic Hall subgroups of the same order. (d) Show that each of these groups is the smallest with the stated property. I know how to solve these problems. My questions: (1) First consider $\mathrm{PSL}(2,p)$ where $p>3$ is a prime number. If $\mathrm{PSL}(2,p)$ satisfies each of the above conditions, what can I say about $p$ ? (2) What can I say about $p$ if $\mathrm{PSL}(2,p)$ meets ALL the conditions (a)-(c)? Does such $p$ exist? (This is just (1), my bad. But how can I find $p$ such that (b) holds but (c) does not?) (3) For a more general case, what if $p$ my first question is replaced by $q$ , where $q>3$ is a prime power? (4) How can we generalize (d) to $\mathrm{PSL}(n,p)$ or $\mathrm{PSL}(n,q)$ for some fixed $n$ ? (5) The answer shows that (2) without (3) happens infinitely many times if we restrict our attention to a specific set $\pi$ of primes.

An element $a' \in S$ is called an inverse of $a$ if $$  aa'a = a \qquad   a'aa' = a'. $$ Denote the set of all inverses by $V(a)$. A semigroup where every element has an inverse is called a regular semigroup . We use Green's relations , in particular the definition of $\mathcal L-, \mathcal R-, \mathcal D-$ and $\mathcal H$-classes. The following is taken from J. M. Howie Fundamental of semigroup theory (page 49): Let $a,b$ be elements of a regular semigroup. Then $(a,b) \in\mathcal L$ if and only if there exists $a' \in V(a), b' \in V(b)$ such that $a'a = b'b$. I tried to prove it on my own, but failed. And I do not understand the proof in the book. So can anyone give me proof of it or clarify the one given in the book? By the way, I was unable to find this proposition for regular semigroups in other books. The proof from the book uses two previously shown Propositions, namely In a regular semigroup (or in a regular $\mathcal D$-class, i.e. every element is regular) each $\mathcal L$-class and each $\mathcal R$-class contains an idempotent. If $D$ is a regular $\mathcal D$-class and $a,b \in D$ are such that $R_a \cap L_b$ and $L_a \cap R_b$ contain idempotents $e,f$ respectively, then the $\mathcal H$-class of $b$ contains an inverse $a^*$ of $a$ such that $aa^* = e, a^*a = f$. Now the proof goes like this: Suppose that $(a,b) \in \mathcal L$. If $a' \in V(a)$ then $a'a$ is an idempotent in $L_a = L_b$. The $\mathcal R$-class $R_b$ contains at least one  idempotent by Proposition 1 above, and then, by Proposition 2 above, the $\mathcal H$-class $R_{a'a} \cap R_e$ contain an inverse $b'$ of $b$ with the property that $b'b = a'a$ (and $bb' = e$). Notice that we have shown the stronger implication that   $$  (a,b) \in \mathcal L \Rightarrow (\forall a' \in V(a))(\exists b' \in V(b)) a'a = b'b. $$ That's it. I found that in an older book by the same author, named Introduction to semigroup theory (which seems to be a precursor of the present book) the same Proposition appears, but the referred $\mathcal H$-class is $R_{a'a} \cap L_e$ and not $R_{a'a} \cap R_e$ (which seems to make more sense as $\mathcal H$-classes are intersection of $\mathcal R$-classes and $\mathcal L$-classes by definition, but note that the $\mathcal H$-class of $b$ is $L_b \cap R_b = L_{a'a} \cap R_e$). But what I do not understand is that to apply Proposition 2 above, we need something like $L_a \cap R_b$ and $R_a \cap L_a$ should contain idempoents, but I do not see that $a'a$ is in $R_a$ (or $R_b$) neither do I see that $e$ is in $L_a = L_b$, and even if I write $e \in R_b \cap L_e$ then I need $a'a \in R_e \cap L_a$, but this I neither see?
