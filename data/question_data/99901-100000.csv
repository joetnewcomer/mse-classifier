The gradient of the line between them is: $$m = (y_1 - y_0)/(x_1 - x_0)$$ And therefore the equation of the line between them is: $$y = m (x - x_0) + y_0$$ Now, since I want another point along this line, but a distance $d$ away from $(x_0, y_0)$, I will get an equation of a circle with radius $d$ with a center $(x_0, y_0)$ then find the point of intersection between the circle equation and the line equation.

7,Gerrymandering on a high-genus surface/can I use my powers for evil?,Gerrymandering on a high-genus surface/can I use my powers for evil?,,"Somewhat in contrast to this question . Let's say the Supreme Court has just issued a ruling that the upper and lower roads of an overpass need not be in the same congressional district. This makes states with lots of overpasses into high-genus surfaces for the purpose of gerrymandering. I, an unscrupulous mathematician, get a call from my state legislature, asking me to consult for them about how best to place new roads in order to achieve their desired district layout, in exchange for a generous fee. Specifically, my state is a rectangle with no existing roads or overpasses. It has $n$ congressional districts. The state legislature has in mind a collection $\{P_{i,j}\}$ of convex polygons with nonempty interior which tile the state, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$ and $j$ from $1$ to at most $m$ for each $i$, and wishes for each $P_{i,j},P_{i',j}$ to be in the same congressional district, thus must be connected by roads (smooth curves). Any time a road passes through a polygon of a different congressional district, an overpass must be built across it to avoid disrupting the other district. Any time two roads meet, an overpass must also be built. Note that for any fixed $i$, some but not all of the $P_{i,j}$ may be empty. The legislature wants to know the minimum number $\mathcal O(n,m)$ of overpasses that need to be built in order to facilitate their gerrymandering, in the worst-case scenario. Equivalently, take a tiling of the unit square $S$ by convex polygons $P_{i,j}$, and $n$-color them such that at most $m$ polygons have the same color. For each color $i$, choose smooth curves $\lambda_{i1},\ldots,\lambda_{ir_i}:[0,1]\to S$ such that  $$\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^m P_{i,j}\cup \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{r_i}\mathrm{im}(\gamma_{ik})$$ is connected. For each color $i$, choose points $p_{i1},\ldots,p_{is_i}$ such that  $$\left(\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^m P_{i,j}\setminus \left(\bigcup\limits_{i'\neq i}\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{r_{i'}}\mathrm{im}(\gamma_{i'k})\right)\right)\cup \{p_{i1},\ldots,p_{is_i}\}$$ is connected. If we can choose the curves and points freely, then $\mathcal O(n,m)$ is the worst-case (among all choices of tiling and coloring) minimum possible value of $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n s_i$. Clearly $\mathcal O(n,1)=0$. A very rough upper bound is $\mathcal O(n,m)\leq n(m-1)(nm-1)$ since we can connect the necessary districts by drawing $n(m-1)$ curves, none of which touch the boundary and each of which intersects at most all $\leq nm-1$ other districts, and intersect each polygon in straight lines. A rough lower bound comes from dividing the square into $nm$ vertical strips and coloring them cyclically, i.e. red, yellow, blue. red, yellow, blue etc. Then any path which connects all districts of the same color must pass through at least all but one district of each other color, so $\mathcal O(n,m)\geq (n-1)(m-1)$. Can these bounds be improved upon, or even an exact formula be found? Note: For those of you not in the United States, this question won’t make much sense unless you’re familiar with gerrymandering . Edit: This question was inspired by my state legislature (Kansas), which tried to make a congressional district which consisted of the conservative western third of the state, a road going across the state, and two liberal cities along the eastern border.

23,What is the geometry in algebraic geometry?,What is the geometry in algebraic geometry?,,"Coming from a physics background, my understanding of geometry (in a very generic sense) is that it involves taking a space and adding some extra structure to it.

For example, we can take a smooth manifold and add a Riemannian metric and a connection, and then we can ask about distances between points, curvature, geodesics, etc. In symplectic geometry, we take an even-dimensional manifold and add a symplectic form, and then we can ask about... well, honestly, I don't know.

Rather than dealing with rectangles of arbitrary size, it is good to start by looking at the specific case of a square. To abstract the problem into a mathematical format, I'll restructure it like so: What is the maximum proportion of a square that can be packed with non-overlapping circle-sectors with origins on the edge of a square? However, $($while still sitting on the bus$)$ I realised that the answer is always ""the whole square"". This is because you can recursively define configurations of sectors that get closer to each other with a smaller angle, as shown below: The way to get around this ""solution"" is by adding another restriction: The sectors should be uniquely defined by their origin and radius. This is possible if ""every sector must have the maximum angle possible where the radius doesn't leave the square"". For example, even the first case for the sequence I gave is no longer allowed. The two sectors have angles of $\frac{\pi}{4}$, but with the new rule the arcs must both have angles of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ as their radii stay in the square for this angle. However, in this case the two sectors overlap, showing that it is an illegal configuration. Here are some examples of allowed configurations: Clearly various ""infinite"" things happen, as these all resemble apollonian gaskets. It seems like a calculus problem but I've spent too much time dealing with topology that I'm not really sure where to start! Once the square case is covered, it's natural to generalise to rectangles and parallelograms, and eventually to any polygon. Once all polygons are ""solved"", any two dimensional shape bounded by a closed curve may be solvable as well! Any thoughts and discussion will be appreciated. EDIT A number of people (mainly friends making fun of me at uni) have pointed out that real windshield wipers do overlap, and that's fundamental to their effectiveness. I realise this, but for the purpose of mathematical abstraction I felt that ""supposing there is no overlap"" creates an ideal level of complexity.

32,Penrose's remark on impossible figures,Penrose's remark on impossible figures,,"I'd like to think that I understand symmetry groups. I know what the elements of a symmetry group are - they are transformations that preserve an object or its relevant features - and I know what the group operation is - composition of transformations. Given a polyhedron or wallpaper tiling or whatever, I could probably start spotting the symmetries, which would entail listing out elements of the symmetry group, and then I could start filling in the multiplication table. Penrose attaches a group to impossible figures to capture their inherent ambiguity, and I'd like to grok these groups like I do symmetry groups. Take a prototypical example, the tribar: He names the ""ambiguity group"" $G=\Bbb R^+$ (positive numbers under multiplication) to describe possible distances of points. We can split the figure up into three components, as above, and interpret them as being disconnected from each other in three-space but from our perspective they seem to make a single figure. For convenience, I think we should let $A_{ij}$ denote points on the figures as well as represent their distances from the origin, interchangeably. One can define the relative distances by $d_{ij}=A_{ij}/A_{ji}$. Since $d_{ji}=d_{ij}^{-1}$, there are only three relevant proportions: $d_{12}$, $d_{23}$, and $d_{31}$. According to Penrose, the $d_{ij}$s do not actually depend on our choice of overlapping points $A_{ij}$, but this seems wrong to me: varying the points $A_{ij}$ through the overlap regions will change them linearly and so any ratio $d_{ij}$ will only remain invariant if $d_{ij}=1$ to begin with. But probably this quibble is unimportant. One can scale the distances the components $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ are from the origin without affecting our perception of them. (Perhaps consider our ""perception"" of them to be their radial projection onto the unit sphere, or something.) The effect of scaling one of these $Q_i$ by a factor of $\lambda$ on the $d_{12},d_{23},d_{31}$ is to scale one of them by $\lambda$, a second by $\lambda^{-1}$, and leave the third unchanged. If the $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ were compatible and could be combined into a single figure, then such a configuration would have $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})=(1,1,1)$. If they were compatible but the components were separated by independent scalings $q_1,q_2,q_3$ (respectively) then we'd have $$(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})=\left(\frac{q_1}{q_2},\frac{q_2}{q_3},\frac{q_3}{q_1}\right). \tag{1}$$ Note that $\tau=d_{12}d_{23}d_{31}$ is an invariant , in the sense that scaling the components independently does not change the value of $\tau$. The compatibility situation $(1)$ occurs precisely when $\tau=1$. Penrose defines the group $H$ to be the tuples $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})\in(\Bbb R^+)^3$ modulo the rescalings by $\lambda$ and modulo the elements of the form $(1)$. As I understand it, the invariant $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})\mapsto\tau$ is a bijection $H\to\Bbb R^+$. But now here are my questions. $\hskip 1.4in$ $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(A)}$ How do we know what the ambiguity group is? The tribar's ambiguity group is $G=\Bbb R^+$. With the Necker cubes above, Penrose says the ambiguity group is $G=\Bbb Z_2$. Is the ambiguity group meant to parametrize the possible positions of the individual pieces of the figure? Where does the group operation of $G$ actually come into play? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(B)}$ How do we know what pieces to cut a figure up into? Since the tribar has obvious threefold symmetry, that kind of inspires the choice of three pieces. But it seems that with the congruence relation used to define $H$, we could choose to put any two of those pieces together into one component and fix its position, only letting the last component vary (which would be one degree of freedom, exactly as $H\cong\Bbb R^+$ predicts). So we could have cut into two pieces. Or we ould cut into six pieces, or any number of pieces. Will it never matter how many pieces we choose? Why would we break apart the tribar's corners but not break apart the faces of the Necker cubes? What figures would we cut into pieces, and what figures would we do something else to? And with the latter figures, what would we do to find their $H$ group? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(C)}$ What are the group elements and what is the group operation? As I mentioned with symmetry groups, it's intuitive what their elements are and what the operation is. But what about with $H$? It seems the elements are physically realizable configurations consistent with our perception, modulo altering the configuration in a way that wouldn't change our perception. The identity element would be the configurations in which our perception is actually correct and sensible. And the group operation seems to be ... I don't know. Presumably we could use componentwise multiplication of the representative tuples $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})$, or equivalently multiplication of the invariants $\tau$, which would make $H\to\Bbb R^+$ a group isomorphism, but how would this operation be meaningful or relevant? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(D)}$ Why is this called a cohomology group? Yes, our $H^1(Q,G)$s are being called cohomology groups. I deliberately put off using that word as long as possible. (And so you've read this far. Suckers.) But in what sense are these groups cohomological? Are there higher cohomology groups $H^n(Q,G)$ and coboundary operators? Is this cohomology dual to some kind of homology of impossible figures? Probably I will be unable to understand answers to this question, as I don't really know what cohomology is in the first place. No time like the present? Ultimately, I'd like to be able to look at an impossible figure and systematically derive its cohomology group, just like I can derive a figure's symmetry group. Or alternately, create impossible figures with given cohomology group. But perhaps the analogy isn't tenable, as cohomology groups aren't really symmetry groups at all.

Given a polyhedron or wallpaper tiling or whatever, I could probably start spotting the symmetries, which would entail listing out elements of the symmetry group, and then I could start filling in the multiplication table. Penrose attaches a group to impossible figures to capture their inherent ambiguity, and I'd like to grok these groups like I do symmetry groups. Take a prototypical example, the tribar: He names the ""ambiguity group"" $G=\Bbb R^+$ (positive numbers under multiplication) to describe possible distances of points. We can split the figure up into three components, as above, and interpret them as being disconnected from each other in three-space but from our perspective they seem to make a single figure. For convenience, I think we should let $A_{ij}$ denote points on the figures as well as represent their distances from the origin, interchangeably. One can define the relative distances by $d_{ij}=A_{ij}/A_{ji}$. Since $d_{ji}=d_{ij}^{-1}$, there are only three relevant proportions: $d_{12}$, $d_{23}$, and $d_{31}$. According to Penrose, the $d_{ij}$s do not actually depend on our choice of overlapping points $A_{ij}$, but this seems wrong to me: varying the points $A_{ij}$ through the overlap regions will change them linearly and so any ratio $d_{ij}$ will only remain invariant if $d_{ij}=1$ to begin with. But probably this quibble is unimportant. One can scale the distances the components $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ are from the origin without affecting our perception of them. (Perhaps consider our ""perception"" of them to be their radial projection onto the unit sphere, or something.) The effect of scaling one of these $Q_i$ by a factor of $\lambda$ on the $d_{12},d_{23},d_{31}$ is to scale one of them by $\lambda$, a second by $\lambda^{-1}$, and leave the third unchanged. If the $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$ were compatible and could be combined into a single figure, then such a configuration would have $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})=(1,1,1)$. If they were compatible but the components were separated by independent scalings $q_1,q_2,q_3$ (respectively) then we'd have $$(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})=\left(\frac{q_1}{q_2},\frac{q_2}{q_3},\frac{q_3}{q_1}\right). \tag{1}$$ Note that $\tau=d_{12}d_{23}d_{31}$ is an invariant , in the sense that scaling the components independently does not change the value of $\tau$. The compatibility situation $(1)$ occurs precisely when $\tau=1$. Penrose defines the group $H$ to be the tuples $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})\in(\Bbb R^+)^3$ modulo the rescalings by $\lambda$ and modulo the elements of the form $(1)$. As I understand it, the invariant $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})\mapsto\tau$ is a bijection $H\to\Bbb R^+$. But now here are my questions. $\hskip 1.4in$ $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(A)}$ How do we know what the ambiguity group is? The tribar's ambiguity group is $G=\Bbb R^+$. With the Necker cubes above, Penrose says the ambiguity group is $G=\Bbb Z_2$. Is the ambiguity group meant to parametrize the possible positions of the individual pieces of the figure? Where does the group operation of $G$ actually come into play? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(B)}$ How do we know what pieces to cut a figure up into? Since the tribar has obvious threefold symmetry, that kind of inspires the choice of three pieces. But it seems that with the congruence relation used to define $H$, we could choose to put any two of those pieces together into one component and fix its position, only letting the last component vary (which would be one degree of freedom, exactly as $H\cong\Bbb R^+$ predicts). So we could have cut into two pieces. Or we ould cut into six pieces, or any number of pieces. Will it never matter how many pieces we choose? Why would we break apart the tribar's corners but not break apart the faces of the Necker cubes? What figures would we cut into pieces, and what figures would we do something else to? And with the latter figures, what would we do to find their $H$ group? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(C)}$ What are the group elements and what is the group operation? As I mentioned with symmetry groups, it's intuitive what their elements are and what the operation is. But what about with $H$? It seems the elements are physically realizable configurations consistent with our perception, modulo altering the configuration in a way that wouldn't change our perception. The identity element would be the configurations in which our perception is actually correct and sensible. And the group operation seems to be ... I don't know. Presumably we could use componentwise multiplication of the representative tuples $(d_{12},d_{23},d_{31})$, or equivalently multiplication of the invariants $\tau$, which would make $H\to\Bbb R^+$ a group isomorphism, but how would this operation be meaningful or relevant? $\sf \color{Fuchsia}{(D)}$ Why is this called a cohomology group? Yes, our $H^1(Q,G)$s are being called cohomology groups. I deliberately put off using that word as long as possible. (And so you've read this far. Suckers.) But in what sense are these groups cohomological? Are there higher cohomology groups $H^n(Q,G)$ and coboundary operators? Is this cohomology dual to some kind of homology of impossible figures? Probably I will be unable to understand answers to this question, as I don't really know what cohomology is in the first place. No time like the present? Ultimately, I'd like to be able to look at an impossible figure and systematically derive its cohomology group, just like I can derive a figure's symmetry group. Or alternately, create impossible figures with given cohomology group. But perhaps the analogy isn't tenable, as cohomology groups aren't really symmetry groups at all.

37,Why do all the Platonic Solids exist?,Why do all the Platonic Solids exist?,,"In three dimensions it is quite easy to prove that there exist at most five Platonic Solids. Each has to have at least three polygons meeting at each vertex, and the angles of these polygons have to add up to less than $2\pi$ . This narrows down the possibilities to three, four or five triangles, three squares or three pentagons. But the proof is not quite complete. One also has to show that each of these possibilities is actually realised. Of course it turns out that they all are. I've been wondering about how to prove this without having to construct each of them individually. After reading this answer , I've managed to reconstruct the following proof. I'm wondering if it's valid. Suppose we want a polyhedron where $m$ $n$ -gons meet at each vertex.   Take any sphere. By Gauss-Bonnet we can draw a regular $n$ -gon on the   sphere with angles $2\pi/m$ . Draw congruent $n$ -gons along each edge   of this one, and continue to extend the tiling in this way. Because of   our choice of angle these polygons must join up locally. We want to   verify that they join up locally. Consider the topological space with one $n$ -gon for each $n$ -gon drawn   on the sphere, joined along the edges whenever the corresponding $n$ -gons share that edge. Then this topological space is a covering   space of the sphere. But the sphere is already simply connected, so   our covering space must be the sphere itself. So we do have a regular   tiling of the sphere. Now create an actual regular polyhedron by   taking the convex hull of the vertices. If this argument does work, can it be simplified so that it could be understood by someone with no knowledge of algebraic topology? Below this line is an attempt by David Speyer to restate the question. I like simplicial complexes better than CW complexes, so I am going to subdivide the polygons in the original question. Instead of a spherical $m$ -gon with angles $2 \pi/n$ , I'm going to place a vertex in the center of the polygon and connect it to all the vertices and the midpoints of all the edges. So I have $2m$ spherical triangles with angles $\pi/m$ , $\pi/n$ and $\pi/2$ . So, here is my rephrasing. Let $(a,b,c)$ be positive integers with $1/a+1/b+1/c > 1$ (in our case, $(2,m,n)$ ). We form a two dimensional simplicial complex $\Delta$ whose vertices are colored amber, blue and crimson, with two triangles on each edge and $2a$ , $2b$ , $2c$ triangles around the amber, blue and crimson vertices respectively. One way to make this more precise is to define $W$ to be the group generated by $s_1$ , $s_2$ , $s_3$ subject to $s_1^2=s_2^2=s_3^2=(s_1 s_2)^a = (s_1 s_3)^b = (s_2 s_3)^c = 1$ . Our vertices correspond to cosets of the subgroups $H_a:=\langle s_1, s_2 \rangle$ , $H_b:=\langle s_1, s_3 \rangle$ and $H_c:=\langle s_2, s_3 \rangle$ , with vertices in the same triangle if they are  of the form $(w H_a, w H_b, w H_c)$ . Then $\Delta$ maps to the $2$ -sphere, sending our base simplex to the spherical triangle $T$ with angles $(\pi/a, \pi/b, \pi/c)$ , and choosing the images of all the other vertices by making $s_1$ , $s_2$ , $s_3$ act by reflections over the sides of $T$ . Anyone who has taught a course on Coxeter groups knows it is true, but a pain to  prove, that the abstractly defined $\Delta$ maps isomorphically to the sphere $S^2$ and, in particular, $W$ is finite.

In the years I spent studying my undergraduate mathematics degree I had always avoided the Geometry courses because the subject (or maybe the way it was taught to me) seemed... tedious. I remember to think ""Euclidean Geometry, manifolds, Riemann metrics, curvature, geodesics... Ok, so what?"" . That thought, that inability to appreciate the beauty of Geometry ---which I can tell it exists by the many people in the mathematical community who know way more than me about it and claim so--- in the same way I distinctly see it (specially) in Complex Analysis has always bothered me. A few days ago I was reading Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis and reached the following theorem: Theorem: If $\varphi$ is convex on $(a,b)$ , then $\varphi$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ . PROOF The idea of the proof is most easily conveyed in geometric language. Those who may worry that this is not ""rigorous"" are invited to transcribe it in terms of epsilons and deltas. Suppose $a<s<x<y<t<b$ . Write $S$ for the point $(s,\varphi(s))$ in the plane, and deal similarly with $x,y,$ and $t$ . Then $X$ is on or below the line $SY$ , hence $Y$ is on or above the line through $S$ and $X$ ; also, $Y$ is on or below $XT$ . As $y\to x$ , it follows that $Y\to X$ , i.e., $\varphi(y)\to\varphi(x)$ . Left-hand limits are handled in the same manner, and the continuity of $\varphi$ follows. The instant I read ""in geometric language"" I started frowning, but I continued reading. After drawing a picture and give it some thought I was thinking, much to my surprise, that it couldn't exist a more beautiful proof of this theorem. I couldn't like more that ""three-lines-Lipschitz"" clean argument; (!!) Today I had a similar ""incident"" working out the proof that the (angle preserving) set of isometries of the Poincaré disk model coincides exactly with the Mobius transformations of the unit disk, so I have decided to give a hard try to Geometry . I want to begin with Differential Geometry which, being closer to my comfort zone, I expect to be a good choice. I have already chosen from which books I will study (Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry ), so my question is Question: Could you please share some example of a geometric argument , geometric result , geometric idea , or even a geometric calculation in the realm of Differential Geometry which ---in the same spirit as the two examples I gave--- you find exceptionally beautiful or enlightening and explain why?

I remember to think ""Euclidean Geometry, manifolds, Riemann metrics, curvature, geodesics... Ok, so what?"" . That thought, that inability to appreciate the beauty of Geometry ---which I can tell it exists by the many people in the mathematical community who know way more than me about it and claim so--- in the same way I distinctly see it (specially) in Complex Analysis has always bothered me. A few days ago I was reading Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis and reached the following theorem: Theorem: If is convex on , then is continuous on . PROOF The idea of the proof is most easily conveyed in geometric language. Those who may worry that this is not ""rigorous"" are invited to transcribe it in terms of epsilons and deltas. Suppose . Write for the point in the plane, and deal similarly with and . Then is on or below the line , hence is on or above the line through and ; also, is on or below . As , it follows that , i.e., . Left-hand limits are handled in the same manner, and the continuity of follows. The instant I read ""in geometric language"" I started frowning, but I continued reading. After drawing a picture and give it some thought I was thinking, much to my surprise, that it couldn't exist a more beautiful proof of this theorem. I couldn't like more that ""three-lines-Lipschitz"" clean argument; (!!) Today I had a similar ""incident"" working out the proof that the (angle preserving) set of isometries of the Poincaré disk model coincides exactly with the Mobius transformations of the unit disk, so I have decided to give a hard try to Geometry . I want to begin with Differential Geometry which, being closer to my comfort zone, I expect to be a good choice. I have already chosen from which books I will study (Spivak's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry ), so my question is Question: Could you please share some example of a geometric argument , geometric result , geometric idea , or even a geometric calculation in the realm of Differential Geometry which ---in the same spirit as the two examples I gave--- you find exceptionally beautiful or enlightening and explain why?

If r is expressed as a parametric equation in the form $r=f(t), z=g(t)$ and $f,g$ are polynomials then a genetic search found the best function of parametric polynomials to be: $r\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}z^\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt6}{9}z^\frac{3}{2}, f\left(t\right)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^3, g\left(t\right)=\frac{9}{2}t^2$ This parametric shape has a maximum radius of 1, height of 4.5, starting volume of $\frac{3^4}{2^5}\pi$ and is shown here: I can't prove that there is (or is not) a better $r(z)$ but... the average surface area of this surface turns out to be $12.723452r^2$ or $4.05\pi r_{max}^2$ .

Assuming A constant coffee flow rate out of the cup. All surfaces radiate heat equally, i.e. liquid surface, bottom of cup and sides of cup. The coffee is drunk quickly enough that the temperature differential between the coffee and the environment can be ignored/assumed constant. So we just need to minimise the average surface area as the liquid drains I have worked out the following 2 alternative equations for the average surface area over the lifetime of the liquid in the cup (see below for derivations): If the volume of the cup is constant Can the function, , be found that minimises the average surface area ?

Integrate the contribution of all such sections. Contribution of top surfaces to average surface area is area of top by proportion of volume that area x dz is: Contribution of bottom surface is constant so adding together all three gives:"," S_{ave} =\pi r_0^2+ \frac{\pi^2}{V}\int_{0}^{h}{{r(s)}^4ds}+\frac{2\pi^2}{V}\int_{0}^{h}{\int_{0}^{s}{r\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dr}{dz}\right)^2}\ dz\ }{r(s)}^2ds\ } \tag{1} S_{ave}=\pi r_0^2+\frac{\pi^2}{V}\int_{0}^{h}r\left(s\right)^4ds+\frac{2\pi^2}{V}\int_{0}^{h}r(s){\underbrace{\int_{s}^{h}{{r\left(z\right)}^2dz\ }}_{\text{Volume Drunk}}}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dr}{ds}\right)^2}ds \tag{2}  V=\pi\int_{0}^{h}{{r(z)}^2dz\ } r(z) S_{ave} r=f(t), z=g(t) f,g r\left(z\right)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}z^\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt6}{9}z^\frac{3}{2}, f\left(t\right)=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}t^3, g\left(t\right)=\frac{9}{2}t^2 \frac{3^4}{2^5}\pi r(z) 12.723452r^2 4.05\pi r_{max}^2 4\pi r_{max}^2 (12.5664) S(s)=\pi r_0^2+\pi r_s^2+2\pi\int_{0}^{s}{r(z)dldz} S(s)=\pi r_0^2+\pi r_s^2+2\pi\int_{0}^{s}{r(z)\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dr}{dz}\right)^2}\ dz\ } S_{ave}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{t_0}^{t_h}{S(s)dt\ } Q=dV/dt =V/T dt\ =\frac{T}{V}dV
