Minor clarification: The question says : $\forall n$ . Now, we know that $1^3+2^3+..+n^3=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$ .

22,Properties of the Discrete Logarithm Problem,Properties of the Discrete Logarithm Problem,,"I am self-studying Hoffstein's An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography , and this is problem 2.3 (p. 107-08). Let $p$ be a prime and $g$ an element in $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ with order $r$. (a) Suppose that $x=a$ and $x=b$ are both integer solutions to the equation $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$. Prove that $a\equiv b \pmod{p-1}$. (b) Prove that $\log_g(h_1h_2)\equiv \log_g(h_1)+\log_g(h_2) \pmod{r}$ for all $h_1,h_2 \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ such that $g^x \equiv h_1 \pmod{p}$ and $g^x \equiv h_2 \pmod{p}$ have integer solutions. (c) Prove that $\log_g (h^n) \equiv n \log_g(h) \pmod{r}$ for all $h \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ such that $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$ has an integer solution and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. My attempt: Feedback highly appreciated (a) The way to think of a primitive root is that $g$ is a generator in $\pmod{p}$ if and only if the function $f(x) \equiv g^x  \pmod{p}$ is a bijection over the domain $\mathbb{F}_p^*=\{1,2,\dots, p-1\}$. Thus our question comes down to prove: $$g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$ which is exceedingly convenient as it is covered by Fermat's Little Theorem . Now, since $g$ is a primitive root it follows that if $a \not b$ and $a \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ then $b=a+(p-1)k$ (for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$). We have $g^{b}\equiv g^{a+(p-1)k} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}\left(g^{p-1} \right)^k \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}$.  which is the same as $a \equiv b \pmod{p-1} $. (b) For the next problem  We have that $g^{\log_g (h_1)+\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{\log_g (h_1)}g^{\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv h_1\cdot h_2$ (c) We use the technique of mathematical induction. It is eminently clear that this is true for the base case $k=1$. Let us thus assume that the result holds for all $k$ up to $k=n-1$. We now show that this implies that it also holds for $k=n$. We have that: \begin{align*} g^{\log_g (h^{n})} &=g^{\log_g (h^{(n-1)+1})}  \\ &=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1}h)} \\ &=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1})}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{$\log_g(h_1h_2)\equiv \log_g(h_1)+\log_g(h_2)$} \\ &=g^{(n-1)\log_g(h)}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{Induction Assumption} \\ &=g^{n\log_g(h)} \tag{Addition Property of Exponential} \end{align*} which means that it holds for the induction step as well.

(c) Prove that $\log_g (h^n) \equiv n \log_g(h) \pmod{r}$ for all $h \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ such that $g^x \equiv h \pmod{p}$ has an integer solution and $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. My attempt: Feedback highly appreciated (a) The way to think of a primitive root is that $g$ is a generator in $\pmod{p}$ if and only if the function $f(x) \equiv g^x  \pmod{p}$ is a bijection over the domain $\mathbb{F}_p^*=\{1,2,\dots, p-1\}$. Thus our question comes down to prove: $$g^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$$ which is exceedingly convenient as it is covered by Fermat's Little Theorem . Now, since $g$ is a primitive root it follows that if $a \not b$ and $a \in \mathbb{F}_p^*$ then $b=a+(p-1)k$ (for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$). We have $g^{b}\equiv g^{a+(p-1)k} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}\left(g^{p-1} \right)^k \pmod{p} \equiv g^{a}$.  which is the same as $a \equiv b \pmod{p-1} $. (b) For the next problem  We have that $g^{\log_g (h_1)+\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv g^{\log_g (h_1)}g^{\log_g (h_2)} \pmod{p} \equiv h_1\cdot h_2$ (c) We use the technique of mathematical induction. It is eminently clear that this is true for the base case $k=1$. Let us thus assume that the result holds for all $k$ up to $k=n-1$. We now show that this implies that it also holds for $k=n$. We have that: \begin{align*} g^{\log_g (h^{n})} &=g^{\log_g (h^{(n-1)+1})}  \\ &=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1}h)} \\ &=g^{\log_g(h^{n-1})}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{$\log_g(h_1h_2)\equiv \log_g(h_1)+\log_g(h_2)$} \\ &=g^{(n-1)\log_g(h)}g^{\log_g(h)} \tag{Induction Assumption} \\ &=g^{n\log_g(h)} \tag{Addition Property of Exponential} \end{align*} which means that it holds for the induction step as well. This completes the proof.",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'proof-verification', 'congruences']"

See here . The question is as follows. How do we see that there do not exist nonconstant, relatively prime, polynomials $a(t)$ , $b(t)$ , and $c(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ such that $$a(t)^3 + b(t)^3 = c(t)^3?$$ There is the following answer, the ""better motivated proof where you see that $\mathbb{CP}^1$ can't map holomorphically to a genus $1$ curve."" Let $a(t)$ , $b(t)$ , $c(t)$ have degree $n_1$ , $n_2$ , $n_3$ , respectively, and $n = \text{max}(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ . Then we can define $A(u, v)$ , $B(u, v)$ , $C(u, v)$ as homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ such that $$A(u, 1) = a(u),\text{ }B(u, 1) = b(u),\text{ }C(u, 1) = c(u).$$ Then, by construction, $$A(u, v)^3 + B(u, v)^3 = C(u, v)^3.$$ Let $$E = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{P}^2 : x^3 + y^3 = z^3\}.$$ $E$ is a smooth curve of genus $1$ , i.e. an elliptic curve. Now, define a map $$\varphi: \mathbb{P}^1 \to E,\text{ }(u, v) \mapsto (A(u, v), B(u, v), C(u, v)).$$ This map is well-defined since $A(u, v)$ , $B(u, v)$ , $C(u, v)$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree which do not vanish simultaneously. Moreover, this map is nonconstant and proper since its source is projective. As the image of a proper map is closed and it is not a point, and $E$ is an irreducible $1$ -dimensional variety follows that $\varphi$ is a surjective morphism. $E$ is a topologically a torus, i..e it has genus $1$ and there is a one up to scaling differential form $\tau$ on it. This will imply that its pullback $\varphi^*\tau$ is a differential form on $\mathbb{P}^1$ , which is impossible since it has genus $0$ . In more formal terms, a surjective map $\mathbb{P}^1 \to E$ gives rise to the injection $H^0(E, \Omega^1) \to H^0(\mathbb{P}^1, \Omega^1)$ . But this is absurd, since the former is a vector space of dimension $1$ and the latter is a vector space of dimension $0$ . Perhaps you might want to say something about why the pullback of a non-zero holomorphic differential is non-zero. $X$ and $Y$ are Riemann surfaces and $f: X \to Y$ holomorphic differential form looks like $g(z)\,dz$ , where $g$ is a holomorphic function.

68,How many prime number mysteries are tied up in the Riemann hypothesis?,How many prime number mysteries are tied up in the Riemann hypothesis?,,"Suppose the most general form of the Riemann hypothesis were established, say, the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), or even the "" Grand Riemann Hypothesis ."" How many of the various unsolved problems concerning prime numbers would be thereby resolved? I know that the GRH is now known to imply that every odd number $\ge 7$ is the sum of three primes.

77,Polynomial iterations II: Strange behaviour of $x^2-7x+5$ under iteration,Polynomial iterations II: Strange behaviour of  under iteration,x^2-7x+5,"About a month ago, I asked a similar question about a certain class of polynomials that seem to defy the odds of ""eventual divisibility"", i.e. iterating an ""eventually divisible"" polynomial we can guarantee that any input will yield a number that is divisible by a certain prime $p$ at least once (and thus infinitely often). Please refer to that question for a thorough explanation of the idea. After some careful case elimination, I was left with (i.e. could not prove/disprove the property for) three quadratic polynomials where linear and constant coefficients are absolutely smaller than $10$ : $(1)$ $x^2-7x-7$ (which is checked up to $p \leq 4 \cdot 10^6$ by Mike Daas with no hits) $(2)$ $x^2-7x+5$ (which is checked up to $p \leq 6881261$ by Mike Daas with no hits) $(3)$ $x^2+5x+7$ (which was shown by Oscar Lanzi to be provably non-eventually divisible) Since the property seems to hold except for trivial exceptions (see other question), it seems highly unusual that these polynomials just happen to not have it by pure chance (even up in the millions as it turns out!). The method that was used for $(3)$ can be applied similarly, but does not yield an exhaustive proof: Let's focus on $(2)$ , since it has the smaller discriminant $\Delta = 29$ . A key idea for disproving eventual divisibility is $$x^2-7x+5 \equiv 0 \mod p \text{ is not solvable} \iff \left(\frac{\Delta}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{29}{p}\right) = -1$$ Using quadratic reciprocity, we can figure out that $$\left(\frac{29}{p}\right) = \left(\frac{p}{29}\right) = -1 \iff p \equiv 2,3,8,10,11,12,14,15,17,18,19,21,26,27 \mod 29$$ i.e. $p$ congruent to one of these residues need not to be checked since the existence of a cycle at $0$ is disproven by the lack of solutions leading to $0$ when iterated. The same argument can also be applied to the fixed-point-method in the mentioned question, but the CRT guarantees that we will never cover all primes with this (and the discriminants get very, very big leading to extra casework). Thus, the list of $p$ left after this procedure begins $$p = 5,7,13,23,53,59,67,71,83,103,107,109,139,\ldots$$ For convenience, let's list the cycles present in the iteration graphs for each of these primes: $$\begin{array}{c|c} p & \text{Cycles} \\ 5 & (0),(3) \\ 7 & (2),(6) \\ 13 & (0,5,8),(9,10) \\ 23 & (3,16,11) \\ 53 & (12),(16,43),(30,6,52,13) \\ 59 & (0,5,54,6,58,13,24),(14,44,40,27) \\ 67 & (15,58),(12,65,23,38,44,25,53,31) \\ 71 & (12,65),(48,56,51) \\ 83 & (33),(58),(36,53) \\ 103 & (48,16,46) \\ 109 & (20,47,32,42,58) \\ 139 & (21),(126),(85,102,104) \end{array}$$ As a bonus, here is a quite bizarre pattern that I spotted while generating the graph for $x^2-7x+5$ with $p=43$ : The erratic behaviour of the cycle's lengths and their residue classes left me clueless and it does not spark much hope for a proof, but nonetheless: Is it possible that the non-eventual divisibility of $x^2-7x-7$ and $x^2-7x+5$ happens to be just by chance, i.e. some anti-""strong law of small numbers"" is at work here?

There is a surjective map $\mathbf{A}_K^{\times}\to \bigoplus_{v\in P} \mathbf{Z},$ for $P$ the set of places of $K,$ sending an idele to its valuation at each place. The kernel is precisely $\mathcal{O}_K^{\times},$ and so $$\mathbf{A}_K^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_K^{\times} \cong \bigoplus_{v\in P} \mathbf{Z}.$$ The diagonal embedding of $K^{\times}$ then corresponds to the subgroup of $\bigoplus_{v\in P}\mathbf{Z}$ consisting of elements whose sum is $0.$ In particular, the quotient by the diagonal subgroup leaves us with just $\mathbf{Z}.$ As a sanity check, $\operatorname{Pic}(\mathbb{P}^1) = \mathbf{Z},$ as found in any book on algebraic geometry, and I believe part of the proof of geometric class field goes by identifying the double quotient with the Picard group, so it makes sense we got $\mathbf{Z}$ here. -- So, I think that in this case, it is telling me that continuous homomorphisms $\rho : \hat{\mathbf{Z}} \to \overline{\mathbf{Q}_{\ell}}^{\times}$ are in bijection with continuous homomorphisms $\mathbf{Z}\to \overline{\mathbf{Q}_{\ell}}^{\times}.$ But this surely is incorrect -- the image of a map out of the profinite integers must be compact, but the image out of $\mathbf{Z}$ is not.

Here are the steps I took to arrive at this solution. Did I arrive at the correct answer or did I make a mistake? Thanks in advance for your time and consideration! (also this is my first post on here so apologies if this is poorly worded) The maximal power of a prime number p that divides n! is given by the series $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lfloor\frac{n}{p^i}\rfloor.$$ Please note that there are finitely many non-zero terms in the series. ${n\choose r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ and always produces an integer solution. Thus, $${1000 \choose 500} = \frac{1000!}{500!(1000-500)!} = \frac{1000!}{500!500!}.$$ If we calculate the maximal power of the prime number 5 that divides evenly into 1000!, we calculate $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lfloor\frac{1000}{5^i}\rfloor = \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^1}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^2}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^3}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^4}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^5}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{1000}{5^6}\rfloor + . . .$$ $$=$$ $$200 + 40 + 8 + 1 + 0 + . . . + 0 + . . . = 249$$ The maximal power of 5 that divides evenly into 1000! is 249. We can say that for some positive integer a, the product $a5^{249} = 1000!$ such that a isn't divisible by 5 itself. Similarly, we can calculate the maximal power of the prime number 5 that divides evenly into 500! to be $$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\lfloor\frac{500}{5^i}\rfloor = \lfloor\frac{500}{5^1}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{500}{5^2}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{500}{5^3}\rfloor + \lfloor\frac{500}{5^4}\rfloor + . . .$$ $$=$$ $$100+ 20+ 4 + + 0 + . . . + 0 + . . . = 124$$ The maximal power of 5 that divides evenly into 500! is 124. We can then that for some integer b, the product $b5^{124} = 500!$ such that b isn't divisible by 5 itself. Thus, we can state that $${1000 \choose 500} = \frac{1000!}{500!500!} = \frac{a5^{249}}{(b5^{124})(b5^{124})} = \frac{a5^{249}}{b^25^{248}} = \frac{a}{b^2}5.$$ Neither a nor b are divisible by 5, which means their quotients or products with other numbers will not result in a integer divisible by 5.

This question needs details or clarity . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 1 year ago . Improve this question $\textbf{Theorem}$ (Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem/Bertrand's postulate): For all integers $n\geq 2$ , there exists an odd prime number $p\geq 3$ satisfying $n<p<2n$ . $\textit{Proof }$ : For $n=2$ , we can simply take $p=3$ which is of course an odd prime number, so assume henceforth that $n\geq 3$ . Now make the strong inductive hypothesis that the Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem is true for all integers $2\leq m<n$ . In particular, since $n\geq 3\Rightarrow 2\leq n-1<n$ , we see that there exists an odd prime number $p\geq 3$ satisfying $n-1<p<2(n-1)\Rightarrow n\leq p<2n$ . We now divide into $2$ cases: $\textbf{Case }1$ : If $n\neq p$ , then we can improve the above inequality to say $n<p<2n$ , which would mean that we're done. $\textbf{Case }2$ : If $n=p$ , then assume for sake of contradiction that all of the integers $p'$ satisfying $p<p'<2p$ are composite numbers. Now construct a well-defined function $f:\{p+1,p+2,...,2p-2,2p-1\}\to\{2,3,...,p-2,p-1\}$ which maps each of those $p-1$ composite numbers to their respective $\textit{smallest prime factor}$ . To elaborate a little more on why $f$ is well-defined, the reason that $f(p')<p$ for all integers $p'$ satisfying $p<p'<2p$ is because first, $f(p')\leq p'$ because it is a $\textit{factor}$ of $p'$ , second $f(p')\notin\{p+1,p+2,...,p'\}$ because it is a $\textit{prime}$ factor of $p'$ (while all those integers were by assumption composite numbers), and finally $f(p')\not = p$ because $p<p'<2p\Rightarrow 1<p'/p<2$ , so $p'/p$ cannot possibly be an integer, hence $p$ cannot possibly be a factor of $p'$ , let alone be the smallest prime factor $f(p')$ of $p'$ . Continuing in Case $2$ above, we remark that the codomain $\{2,3,...,p-2,p-1\}$ of $f$ has only $p-2$ integers in it while $f$ 's domain of composite numbers $\{p+1,p+2,...,2p-2,2p-1\}$ has $p-1>p-2$ elements in it. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two composite numbers $a,b$ satisfying $p<a<b<2p$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$ . Let us denote this prime number as $q:=f(a)=f(b)$ . From the discussion in the preceding paragraph, we see that $2\leq q<p$ , so by the original strong inductive hypothesis that we made, we see that there exists an odd prime number $r\geq 3$ satisfying $q<r<2q$ . Now within this Case $2$ , we have to break into $3$ more subcases and show that in each of the $3$ subcases, a contradiction arises. $\textbf{Subcase }1$ : If $r>p$ , then since $r<2q<2p$ , we see that we would have $p<r<2p$ , which would directly give a contradiction to the original assumption that all the integers $p'$ satisfying $p<p'<2p$ are composite. $\textbf{Subcase }2$ : If $r=p$ , then we would have $q<p<2q\Rightarrow p<2q<2p\Rightarrow 1/p<1/q<2/p$ . Recall that we also had $p<a<2p$ and $p<b<2p$ , so multiplying each of these inequalities with the one above, we have: $$1<a/q<4$$ $$1<b/q<4$$ But since by construction $q$ was a factor of $a$ and was also a factor of $b$ , we see that $a/q$ and $b/q$ must both be integers, so in fact we can improve the above inequalities to say: $$2\leq a/q\leq 3$$ $$2\leq b/q\leq 3$$ This means that $a\in\{2q,3q\}$ and similarly $b\in\{2q,3q\}$ . But recalling that $a<b$ and $q\geq 2>0\Rightarrow 3q>2q$ , we in fact deduce that $a=2q$ and $b=3q$ . Since $q$ was also the $\textit{smallest prime}$ factor of $a$ , and $2$ is clearly seen to be a prime factor of $a$ , we conclude that we must have $q=2$ , hence $a=4$ and $b=6$ . But recalling the inequalities $p<a$ and $b<2p$ , we see this would imply $p<4$ and $p>3$ , but there are no integers strictly between $3$ and $4$ . $\textbf{Subcase }3$ : If $r<p$ , then we would just apply the strong inductive hypothesis yet again to locate an odd prime number $s\geq 3$ satisfying $r<s<2r$ . If $s\geq p$ , then we could reason as in the above $2$ subcases, and if $s<p$ , then we would just apply the strong inductive hypothesis $\textit{yet again}$ , doing it as many times as necessary until we obtain an odd prime number which is greater than or equal to $p$ , and hence handled by the above $2$ subcases (note that this algorithm would be guaranteed to terminate because otherwise we would have a strictly monotone increasing sequence of odd prime numbers that is bounded from above by $p$ ).","Closed .

90,Squarefree parts of integers of the form $xy(x+2y)(y+2x)$,Squarefree parts of integers of the form,xy(x+2y)(y+2x),"The motivation for this question comes from Theorem 3.3 of the 1995 paper Tilings of Triangles by M. Laczkovich, which states: Let $x$ and $y$ be non-zero integers such that $x+2y\neq 0\neq y+2x$ . Then there is  a positive integer $k$ such that the equilateral triangle can be dissected into $n=|xy(x+2y)(y+2x)k^2|$ congruent triangles. I am curious about the realizable squarefree parts of such integers, hereafter $s(x,y)$ . Since we focus on the squarefree part, it suffices to consider the case where $\gcd(x,y)=1$ . In the range $|x|,|y|<10,000$ , the realizable values of $s(x,y)$ are $$1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 29, 30, 33,\ldots$$ of which the squarefree integers missing are $$2, 3, 7, 26, 31, 38, 43, 51, 53,\ldots$$ This sequence is not in OEIS, but I am very far from confident that it is complete; the smallest solution for $s(x,y)=19$ is given by $x=578,y=-225$ and for $s(x,y)=37$ it is $x=5929,y=648$ . However, if there are any squarefree integers missing from the image of $s$ then no compatible OEIS sequences exist, even allowing for an initial $0$ term. I would be curious to see a proof that specific values like $7$ are not realizable by this function, even if it does not generalize to a complete characterization. Alternatively, pointers to open problems that render solving this very difficult or conjectures that would imply certain results here would also be welcome. As an aside, here is a sketch of a rough heuristic argument (not a proof!) that the equation $s(x,y)=k$ should have only finitely many solutions for a fixed $k$ with $x$ and $y$ coprime: Consider the squarefree parts of $x$ , $y$ , $2x+y$ , and $x+2y$ , hereafter $a,b,c,d$ respectively. No prime greater than $3$ can be shared among two of $a,b,c,d$ without violating coprimality, so we have finitely many ways to partition the factors of $k$ among the four values times at most $4^4$ ways to assign them all an additional factor of $1,2,3,$ or $6$ . So we are seeking a solution to one of a finite number of equation systems of the form $x=\pm a\cdot p^2, y=\pm b\cdot q^2, x+2y=\pm c\cdot r^2, 2x+y=\pm d\cdot s^2$ . Let's estimate the expected number of solutions to one such equation system with $\frac z2 < |x|,|y|\le z$ . We have $O(\sqrt{z})$ choices for each of $x$ and $y$ in this range, hence $O(z)$ choices for the pair. For each such choice of $x$ and $y$ , if we model an integer $n$ of having an $O(1/n)$ chance to be square, and assume independence, we'll get an $O(1/z^2)$ chance of success (ie that both $c(x+2y)$ and $d(2x+y)$ ended up being perfect squares) for every such $x,y$ we pick. Adding up, we have (heuristically) an expected $O(1/z)$ total solutions for valid $x,y$ in this range. If we sum this over the ranges $[\frac z2=1,z=2],[\frac z2=2,z=4],[4,8],[8,16],\ldots$ we find that the sum converges. Hence, the expected number of solutions across all the equations, and so the expected number of solutions to $s(x,y)=k$ , is finite, though the expected size of a solution if one exists is infinite. This accords fairly well with the data so far, including the isolated very large solutions. (Of course, there might well be substantial correlations or patterns in the factors of $x+2y$ and $2x+y$ that make this model of the terms as independent random draws extremely bad! But absent reasons to suspect such patterns in one direction or another, I'd guess this is roughly the behavior of this function.)","The motivation for this question comes from Theorem 3.3 of the 1995 paper Tilings of Triangles by M.

Below are my two personal conjectures, based on manual realisation for smaller $k$ and a rudimentary Python program I made for bigger but still small $k$ .

Plus, the fact that this concerns both $S(k) + 1$ AND $S(k) - 1$ could potentially lead towards the twin prime conjecture or something...? $k = 8$ stands out since $S(8) + 1 = 841 = 29^2$ is not squarefree, and of course if $(1)$ holds then there's no need of talking about multiplicity in $(2)$ for $k \neq 8$ .

Is this what's going on? Note that toward the end of the book, Cox discusses an algorithm to solve the problem. But as far as I can tell, this is just an algorithm to find , not to solve . (And anyway, there is obviously an algorithm to solve ; the issue at hand is whether there is an efficient algorithm. I apologize if the answer to this question is already contained in Cox's book. I haven't read it in detail.","x^2+ny^2 n>0 p p=x^2+ny^2 f_n p=x^2+ny^2 f_n(x)=0 p p=x^2+ny^2 \left|x\right|,\left|y\right|<\sqrt p (2\sqrt{p})^2=4p (x,y) f_n(x)=0\mod p p x 4 f_n x^2+ny^2 n=1 p=1\mod 4 p h(-4n) 1 D p p n f_n=0\mod p p f_n f_n(x)=0\mod p f_n(x)=0\mod p","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'diophantine-equations', 'computational-complexity', 'quadratic-forms']"
96,A especial case of Eichler and Shimura,A especial case of Eichler and Shimura,,"in Silverman Tate, Rational Points on Elliptic Curves the exercise 4.6 describes a special case of a theorem of Eichler and Shimura, the exercise is about the elliptic curve $$C:y^2=x^3-4x^2+16,$$ let $M_p=\#C(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $F(q)$ the formal power series $$ F(q)=q\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^n)^2(1-q^{11n})^2=q-2q^2-q^3+2q^4+\dotsb $$ let $N_m$ be the coefficient of $q^n$ in $F(q)$ $$F(q)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}N_mq^n$$ . The exercise ask for compute the sum $M_p+N_p$ and formulate and prove a conjecture. I run a computation in Sage and its seems that the conjecture is that for every prime $p$ we have $M_p+N_p=p$ . I have the following questions Is this the result of Eichler and Shimura? I see the product in LMFB and $F(q)$ is equal to $\eta(z)^2\eta(11z)^2$ , so I think that the curve $C$ is the modular curve $X_0(11)$ , is this correct? I saw the same product in Taylor Modular Arithmetic: Driven by Inherent Beauty and Human Curiosity , in this case for the curve $y^2+y=x^3-x^2$ , are this the same curve $C$ ? (I mean birrationaly isomorphic curves) I dont know about modular forms, I look at the paper The modular curves $X_0(11)$ and $X_1(11)$ , and its seems that there is a path from the modular form to the elliptic curve, there is also a path that begins in the elliptic curve and produces $F(Q)$ ? (I know that this is the Modularity Theorem Shimura-Taniyama), I mean in this specific case there is a elementary path that produces the modular form $F(q)$ from the curve $C$ ? In general what are the suggestions for this special case, I mean in this case is an exercise of a book for undergraduates, so I think that the author considers that an advanced undergraduate can do this exercise, but I don see any suggestions in the book.
