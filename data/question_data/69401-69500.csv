0,Having difficulty understanding topological groups.,Having difficulty understanding topological groups.,,"Let $G$ be a group and $x,y\in G$. We say that a topology $\mathcal{T}$ is a group topology if the functions $$f: G\times G \rightarrow G,\quad (x,y)\mapsto xy$$ and $$g: G\to G,\quad x\mapsto x^{-1}$$ are continuous. We call the pair $(G,\mathcal{T})$ a topological group. I am trying to understand the above definition by playing around with some basic examples. To create an example for myself, I tried to take the symmetric group $S_{3}$ and tried to turn it into as many topological groups as possible. Right away, I've dismissed the discrete and trivial topology as intuitively obvious as topological groups and I feel like there are no other group topologies on $S_{3}$. Is this true? I tried to constructively create a third group by setting $(123) \in S_{3}$ as an open set for my soon to be topology. Using the definition of a topology we know that $$\{\emptyset, (123), S_{3}\}\subseteq \mathcal{T}.$$ Now, if I require $f$ to be continuous, I am already extremely lost to the extent that I don't know what to say. We have that $f$ is a function from $G\times G \rightarrow G$ as function on group elements; but the definition of continuity requires $f: X\rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces. My inclination would be to ignore this technical detail by assuming that $G\times G$ and $G$ can act as topological spaces, which leads me back into a circle as to what the open sets of $G$ have to be. Do the open sets of $G$ as a topological space also have to be a topological group?  How would I begin to pick a topology on $G\times G$? The box topology is the most natural, but why not a more exotic one? This seems to have opened up a much larger barrel of worms for me when all I did was conjecture to myself that the only two group topologies on $S_{3}$ are the discrete topology and the trivial one.","Let $G$ be a group and $x,y\in G$.

55,Is $C^{\infty}$-related an equivalence relation?,Is -related an equivalence relation?,C^{\infty},"I am working on the ""A comprehensive introduction to differential geometry"" by Michael Spivak. I have a question about an exercise in chap 2, on differential structures. Let $M$ be a manifold, and $U$ and $V$ be open subsets of $M$. The functions $x:U\rightarrow x(U)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and $y:V\rightarrow y(V)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ are co-ordinate mappings on $M$. Spivak then says two such maps are $C^{\infty}$-related if: $y\circ x^{-1}:x(U\cap V)\rightarrow y(U\cap V)$ $x\circ y^{-1}:y(U\cap V)\rightarrow x(U\cap V)$ are both $C^{\infty}$ An exercise asks to show that this is not an equivalence relation. I can't see what is wrong with my reasoning, which seems to show that it is an equivalence relation. Here is my proof: To check it is an equivalence relation we need to prove the 3 properties: Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity. The relation is: $x\sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ are $C^{\infty}$-related Reflexivity: $x\circ x^{-1} = Id$ which is a $C^{\infty}$ map. Symmetry: If $x\sim y$ then $y\sim x$ since the $C^{\infty}$-related condition is symmetric. Transitivity: If $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$ then $x\circ y^{-1}$ and $y\circ z^{-1}$ are both $C^{\infty}$, so $(x\circ y^{-1})\circ (y\circ z^{-1})=x\circ z^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$. Similarly, $y\circ x^{-1}$ and $z\circ y^{-1}$ are both $C^{\infty}$, so $(z\circ y^{-1})\circ (y\circ x^{-1})=z\circ x^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$. So the transitive condition also holds.

Let $i \colon X \hookrightarrow \beta X$ be an embedding into a compact Hausdorff space $\beta X$. Then for every continuous map $f\colon X \to K$ where $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space there exists a unique continuous map $\widehat f \colon \beta X \to K$ such that $\widehat f \circ i =f$.  (In the other words, every continuous map $X\to K$ has a continuous extension $\beta X\to K$.) http://presheaf.com/?d=d4l86n4i40s4n18675m3rw6cye1p It is known that if we require the above property to be true not for all compact Hausdorff spaces $K$ but only for $K=[0,1]$, i.e. for the unit interval, then we get an equivalent definition. (One possible argument to show this is based on the fact that every compact Hausdorff space embeds into a power of the unit interval.) My question is: Which (compact Hausdorff) spaces $K$ has similar property as unit interval, i.e., the property that if we require the universal property from the definition of Stone-Čech compactification to hold only for this space $K$, then we obtain an equivalent definition? Is complete characterization known? Are these spaces precisely the generators of the reflective subcategory $\mathbf{CHaus}$ of the category $\mathbf{Top}$? Here $\mathbf{CHaus}$ denotes the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, $\mathbf{Top}$ is the category of topological spaces. By a generator of a reflective subcategory I mean a space such that its reflective hull is precisely this subcategory. For example, this is true if we take the unit circle $S$, simply because $[0,1]$ is a closed subspace of $S$.

Let $i \colon X \hookrightarrow \beta X$ be an embedding into a compact Hausdorff space $\beta X$. Then for every continuous map $f\colon X \to K$ where $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space there exists a unique continuous map $\widehat f \colon \beta X \to K$ such that $\widehat f \circ i =f$.  (In the other words, every continuous map $X\to K$ has a continuous extension $\beta X\to K$.) http://presheaf.com/?d=d4l86n4i40s4n18675m3rw6cye1p It is known that if we require the above property to be true not for all compact Hausdorff spaces $K$ but only for $K=[0,1]$, i.e. for the unit interval, then we get an equivalent definition. (One possible argument to show this is based on the fact that every compact Hausdorff space embeds into a power of the unit interval.) My question is: Which (compact Hausdorff) spaces $K$ has similar property as unit interval, i.e., the property that if we require the universal property from the definition of Stone-Čech compactification to hold only for this space $K$, then we obtain an equivalent definition? Is complete characterization known? Are these spaces precisely the generators of the reflective subcategory $\mathbf{CHaus}$ of the category $\mathbf{Top}$? Here $\mathbf{CHaus}$ denotes the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, $\mathbf{Top}$ is the category of topological spaces. By a generator of a reflective subcategory I mean a space such that its reflective hull is precisely this subcategory.

98,When is the closure of a path connected set also path connected?,When is the closure of a path connected set also path connected?,,"What are the most general criteria we can impose on a locally path connected Hausdorff space $X$ and a path connected subset $A$ such that $\overline{A}$ is path connected? Do more restrictions need to be imposed on $X$ or $A$? For instance, I know that if $\overline{A}$ is locally path connected then $\overline{A}$ is path connected; for all $x \in \overline{A}$ and some neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is open in $\overline{A}$, there must be some path connected neighborhood $U' \subseteq U$ of $x$ that is open in $\overline{A}$. That is, there is some open subset $V'$ of $X$ such that $U' = V' \cap \overline{A}$. Since $x$ is a point of closure of $A$, $V'$ must contain some point $x' \in A \subseteq \overline{A}$, i.e. $x' \in U'$, so $x$ is path connected to $x'$ and hence also to $A$. This holds for all $x \in \overline{A}$ so $\overline{A}$ is path connected. However, the tough part is proving that $\overline{A}$ is locally path connected, because $\overline{A}$ is probably (?) not open in $X$. I'm a complete novice so the only useful thing I know from browsing definitions is that all open subsets of a locally path connected space inherit the local path connectivity. Are there more ways to prove that a subspace inherits local path connectedness? This is more specific, but would it help if I knew that $A$ was the set difference of two closed sets (i.e. the intersection of a closed set and an open set)? I've been looking at stronger restrictions such as $X$ being locally simply connected , but the online documentation is scarce. Would local simple connectivity be ""inherited more easily"" by subspaces?","What are the most general criteria we can impose on a locally path connected Hausdorff space $X$ and a path connected subset $A$ such that $\overline{A}$ is path connected?

99,For which topological measure spaces do open sets always have positive measure?,For which topological measure spaces do open sets always have positive measure?,,"I want to generalize the result for $\mathbb{R}^n$, that any non-trivial open set has positive measure. Open sets and measure zero Question: For which types of topological measure spaces is it true that every non-trivial (i.e. non-empty) open set has positive measure? My thinking was that only inner regularity of the measure, combined with local compactness of the space, would be necessary. There are some problems with this: (1) We don't just need that every point has a compact neighborhood for this to work -- otherwise we would be able to prove that any set containing a compact set has positive measure. We need that every point has a compact neighborhood with positive measure. This does not seem to follow from the given candidate assumptions. And (2) The possible definitions of local compactness vary depending on whether or not the space is Hausdorff. Obviously the topological measure space needs to be Hausdorff in order for it to be inner regular, but there are weaker notions which might be sufficient and which don't require $T_2$. Apparently we also need left-invariance, i.e. that our topological measure space is in fact a measurable topological group. measure of open set with measure Haar But from the answer given to that question the following is still unclear to me: Do we really need Hausdorff?
