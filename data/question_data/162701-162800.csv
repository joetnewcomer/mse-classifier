3,What prevents the restriction of a Haar measure to a closed subgroup from being a Haar measure?,What prevents the restriction of a Haar measure to a closed subgroup from being a Haar measure?,,"Let $\mu$ be a Haar measure on a locally compact Hausdorff topological group $G$, and let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$.  If we restrict $\mu$ to the Borel sets of $G$ which are contained in $H$ (this restriction will include the Borel sets of $H$), it is easy to see that $\mu$ is a Borel measure on $H$.  Let's call this restriction $\lambda$. Sometimes $\lambda$ is a Haar measure on $H$, sometimes it isn't.  If $G$ and $H$ are finite groups, then we can take $\mu$ and its restriction to be the counting measure.  But if, for example, $G = \mathbb{R}$ and $H = \mathbb{Z}$, then the restriction of the Lebesgue measure to the Borel sets of $\mathbb{Z}$ (actually, the power set of $\mathbb{Z}$ since $H$ is discrete) is the zero measure.

I intend to use Grinstead and Snell's ""Introduction to Probability"", to develop intuition regarding probability. I have heard good things about this book. Is my background sufficient for this? I have taken statistics courses before but never a formal Probability course. I am not sure that which Measure Theory book will best suit my needs: 1) Since I am self-studying, I want a book that picks up from the very basics of Measure theory (i.e. it should not assume a math background more advanced than mine). 2) It should not skimp on rigor but should also be easy to read (i.e. the proofs do not skip huge amounts of steps, which would be very bad for me since I will be studying by myself). 3) It would be helpful if the book has informative problems, to which I may be able to find solutions if I absolutely need to. 4) Also it would be great if the book has a chapter on Probability Theory.

So the questions are the following: Is there any non-Borel measurable subset $Z\subseteq [0,1]$? It seems that yes, as of the standard example (e.g. here ). Is there another way this could work out? Am I doing something wrong? The reason why I am reluctant to say NO is that this is a basic assumption in a published paper ( thou clicketh here, footnote 6 ). This leads to another question; does my expression differ from the one used in the paper: $$\beta(b)(E) = \int_{\{i\in[0,1]:b_{i} \in E\}} di$$ Thank you very much Manuel",,['measure-theory']

The best function I found so far is $$ f(x)=\frac{e^{-\sqrt{x}}}{2\sqrt{x}} $$ Then we can see that $f\in L^1( \mathbb{R})$ , not $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ , because of $1/x$ problems, and for an interval $I=[a,b]$ with $0\leq a\leq b$ : $$ \int_{I}f\leq \int_I \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}=\sqrt{b}-\sqrt{a}\leq \sqrt{b-a}=\sqrt{m(I)} $$ Now also we notice that $F=-e^{-\sqrt{x}}$ is an antiderivative for f.

Let $B := \bigcap_n \bigcup_m B_{nm}$ . Then $A \subset B \in \mathcal X$ and $\mu^* (A) = \mu (B)$ . It follows from $\mu^* (A) < \infty$ that $\mu^* (A')=0$ with $A' := B \setminus A$ .  With similar reasoning, there is $B' \in \mathcal X$ such that $A' \subset B'$ and $\mu^* (A') = \mu (B')$ . It follows that $A' \in \mathcal N$ . We have $$ A^c := X \setminus A = (X \setminus B) \cup A'. $$ It follows that $A^c \in \overline{\mathcal X}$ and thus $A \in \overline{\mathcal X}$ . $\mu$ is $\sigma$ -finite. There is a sequence of $(X_n)$ of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal X$ such that $\bigcup_n X_n = X$ and $\mu (X_n) < \infty$ for all $n$ .

94,Measure of Compact Set with Empty Interior,Measure of Compact Set with Empty Interior,,"For my Integration course I've been proposed the following problem with which I have been struggling: Prove that there exists a compact set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with empty interior and measure $0 \leq \alpha < +\infty$ . My approach: My first idea was to use an appropiate real continuous non-negative function such that $f(x_0)=0, \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = +\infty$ and use the intermediate value theorem. Following this reasoning, let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ Lebesgue measurable which will be explicitly constructed later. Define, $f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, f(x) = m(A \cap [-\underline{x},\underline{x}])$ where $\underline{x} = (x,\ldots,x)^t$ is a $\mathbb{R}^n$ vector. I claim that $f$ a continuous function such that $f(0)=0, \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = m(A)$ . Proof: Given $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}, \varepsilon > 0$ . Choose $\delta = (\frac{\varepsilon}{2})^{1/n}$ , if $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} : |x-x_0| < \delta$ , we may suppose that $x < x_0$ (the other case is completely analogous), then $$|f(x)-f(x_0)| = |m(A \cap [-\underline{x},\underline{x}])-m(A \cap [-\underline{x_0},\underline{x_0}])| = $$ $$ = m(A \cap ([-\underline{x_0},-\underline{x}) \cup (\underline{x},\underline{x_0}])) = 2 m(A \cap (\underline{x},\underline{x_0}]) = 2 |x-x_0|^n < 2 \delta^n < \varepsilon$$ $f(0) = 0$ is trivial. Finally, in order to compute $\lim_{x \to \infty}$ , note that the function is monotonous increasing hence the limit exists (either finite or infinite limit). Let $x_n$ be a sequence such that $x_n \to +\infty$ . Therefore, there exists a monotonous increasing subsequence $\{x_{n_k}\}$ . Therefore, taking the limit to the sequence of $m(A \cap [-\underline{x_{n_k}},\underline{x_{n_k}}])$ is the measure  of increasing sets, hence is the measure of the union of the sets, that is, $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = m(\bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} A \cap [-\underline{x_{n_k}},\underline{x_{n_k}}]) = m(A)$ Note that, in particular, if $A$ is a closed set with empty interior, then the set $A \cap [-x,x]$ would be compact and with empty interior. Therefore, it will be enough to find a convenient set $A$ such that (i) is closed, (ii) has empty interior (iii) has infinite measure in order to complete the exercise. In doing so, let $C$ be the fat Cantor Set of measure $\frac{1}{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ , which is a closed set with empty interior. Now, let $C' = \bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} (C+n)$ hence $m(C')=+\infty$ . Finally, define $A = \mathbb{R} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{R} \times C'$ . Then, $A$ is closed as it is product of closed sets, has empty interior and has infinite measure. Therefore, such a set has been found verifying (i),(ii),(iii). Proof of C' being closed: Let $\{x_n\} \subset C'$ be an arbitrary sequence that converges, $x_n \to x$ . Then, $x_n$ must be bounded, that is, there exist a finite number $\{n_1,\ldots,n_k\}$ such that $\{x_n\} \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^k (C+n_i)$ which is a closed set, hence the limit $x \in \bigcup_{i=1}^k (C+n_i) \subset C'$ , that is, $C'$ is closed as desired. Another idea for constructing A: Let $\{x_n\}$ be an enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ , let $A' = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} B(x_n:1/2^n)$ . Then, $A'$ is open and has finite measure. Therefore, let $A=(A')^c$ . Then $A$ is closed, has infinite measure and empty interior (as it contains no rational points). I would like to know whether if my reasoning is correct and if there are any other alternative (simpler) ways to handle the problem. Another idea I also had was to construct a set as the union of several fat Cantor Sets which add up to the given $\alpha$ , which will be called $A'$ . Then, define $K=A' \times [0,1] \times \cdots \times [0,1]$ and I would like to use that $m(K)=m(A')$ though I'm not sure about this fact (we haven't studied how measures behave under cartesian product).","For my Integration course I've been proposed the following problem with which I have been struggling: Prove that there exists a compact set with empty interior and measure .

Vitali's Convergence Theorem, Finite Case (one possible statement - I have seen many slight variants): Let $\{f_n:n\in\Bbb N\}\subset\mathcal{L}^p(X)$ where $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ is a finite measure space. Suppose $(f_n)$ has a pointwise limit $f$ ; if $\{f_n\}$ is an equiintegrable family, then $f\in\mathcal{L}^p$ and $\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_Xf_n\d\mu=\int_Xf\d\mu$ . And ""my"" proof (a combination of Royden's less general work and what I have scrounged from other stack posts): As this proof immediately generalises if $p\neq1$ , w.l.o.g take $p=1$ . As $\mu(X)\lt\infty$ , Egorov's theorem ensures that $\forall\delta\gt0,\,\exists E\in\mathcal{A}:\mu(E)\lt\delta,\,(f_n)|_{X\setminus E}\rightrightarrows f|_{X\setminus E}$ . The $\mu$ -finiteness of $X$ also gives that $X\setminus E$ is of finite measure, hence, by uniform convergence: $$\forall\varepsilon\gt0,\,\exists\delta\gt0,\,\int_{X\setminus E}|f-f_n|\d\mu\lt\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$$ Where $E$ is as before and all $n\gt N$ are suitably large, and $\delta$ is chosen suitably small. Fatou's Lemma combined with the equiintegrability of $\{f_n\}$ shows that, if $\delta$ is suitably small: $$\int_E|f|\d\mu=\int_E\liminf_{n\to\infty}|f_n|\d\mu\le\liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_E|f_n|\d\mu\lt\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$$ Since equiintegrability requires that if $\mu(E)\lt\delta,\int_E|f_n|\d\mu$ may be made as small as desired, with the same $\delta$ for all $n$ . Taking $\delta$ to be the smaller of the two used above, and for $n$ as large as before, and $E$ as before, then one has: $$\begin{align}\forall\varepsilon\gt0,\,\forall n\gt N:\int_X|f-f_n|\d\mu&\le\int_E|f-f_n|\d\mu+\int_{X\setminus E}|f-f_n|\d\mu\\&\le\int_E|f|\d\mu+\int_E|f_n|\d\mu+\int_{X\setminus E}|f-f_n|\d\mu\\&\lt\frac{\varepsilon}{3}+\frac{\varepsilon}{3}+\frac{\varepsilon}{3}=\varepsilon\end{align}$$ And therefore $f_n$ converges to $f$ in $\mathcal{L}^p$ norm. One deduces that $f\in\mathcal{L}^p(X)$ by a similar argument, that necessitates the integrability of $\{f_n\}$ . However, I am fairly sure that one has convergence in $\mathcal{L}^p$ norm anyway, regardless of whether or not $\{f_n\}\subset\mathcal{L}^p$ , since Egorov's theorem doesn't require integrability, and I don't believe any of my steps did either. Using the above definition of tightness, if one requires that $\{f_n\}$ is also tight then the requirement that $\mu(X)\lt\infty$ may be dropped; moreover, in this case, I believe one has that $f$ is $p$ -integrable and that $f_n\to f$ in norm regardless of whether or not $f_n$ are themselves $p$ -integrable.
