44,Sequential sums $1+2+\cdots+N$ that are squares [duplicate],Sequential sums  that are squares [duplicate],1+2+\cdots+N,"This question already has answers here : General formula to obtain triangular-square numbers (5 answers) Closed 10 years ago . While playing with sums $S_n = 1+\cdots+n$ of integers, I have just come across  some ""mathematical magic"" I have no explanation and no proof for. Maybe you can give me some comments on this: I had the computer calculating which Sn are squares, and it came up with the following list: Table row $N$        sum($1+\cdots+N$)   M (square root of sum) r=1     N=1     sum=1       M=1 r=2 N=8         sum=36      M=6 r=3 N=49        sum=1225        M=35 r=4 N=288       sum=41616       M=204 r=5 N=1681  sum=1413721     M=1189 r=6     N=9800  sum=48024900    M=6930 Of course we have $1+\cdots+N = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$, but this gives no indication for which N the sum $1+\cdots+N$  is a square. Can you guess how in this table we can calculate the entries in row 2 from the entries in row 1? Or the entries in row 3 from the entries in row 2?  Or the entries in row 4 from the entries in row 3?  Or the entries in row 5 from the entries in row 4? I looked at the above table and made some strange observations: The value of the next M can be easily calculated from the previous entries:  Take the M from the previous row, multiply by 6 and subtract the M from two rows higher up.          $M(r) = 6*M(r-1)–M(r-2)$  How is this possible? The S(r)  we  calculate as $S(r) = M(r)^2$. Note that we do not know whether this newly constructed  number $S_r$ is in fact of the type $1+\cdots+k$ for some $k$.

Puzzled,  Karl","This question already has answers here : General formula to obtain triangular-square numbers (5 answers) Closed 10 years ago . While playing with sums $S_n = 1+\cdots+n$ of integers, I have just come across  some ""mathematical magic"" I have no explanation and no proof for. Maybe you can give me some comments on this: I had the computer calculating which Sn are squares, and it came up with the following list: Table row $N$        sum($1+\cdots+N$)   M (square root of sum) r=1     N=1     sum=1       M=1 r=2 N=8         sum=36      M=6 r=3 N=49        sum=1225        M=35 r=4 N=288       sum=41616       M=204 r=5 N=1681  sum=1413721     M=1189 r=6     N=9800  sum=48024900    M=6930 Of course we have $1+\cdots+N = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$, but this gives no indication for which N the sum $1+\cdots+N$  is a square. Can you guess how in this table we can calculate the entries in row 2 from the entries in row 1? Or the entries in row 3 from the entries in row 2?  Or the entries in row 4 from the entries in row 3?  Or the entries in row 5 from the entries in row 4? I looked at the above table and made some strange observations: The value of the next M can be easily calculated from the previous entries:  Take the M from the previous row, multiply by 6 and subtract the M from two rows higher up.          $M(r) = 6*M(r-1)–M(r-2)$  How is this possible? The S(r)  we  calculate as $S(r) = M(r)^2$. Note that we do not know whether this newly constructed  number $S_r$ is in fact of the type $1+\cdots+k$ for some $k$. The value of  the next N can be calculated as            N(r) = Floor($M(r)*\sqrt 2$),  where Floor means “rounding down  to the next lower integer“.

But they haven't indicated a quadrant. Do I assume the quadrant is I only? What am i missing? Thanks again for your help.",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

Background We consider two distinct numbers $a,b\in\mathbb{R}^+$ , no matter $a<b$ or $b<a$ , we have: $$\frac{a^ab^b}{a^bb^a}=\Big(\frac{a}{b}\Big)^{a-b}>1$$ and hence $a^ab^b>a^bb^a$ . I am wondering about possible generalization(s). First of all, for the case of three distinct numbers $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}^+$ , $a^ab^bc^c>a^bb^cc^a$ and $a^ab^bc^c>a^cb^ac^b$ , or simply $a^ab^bc^c>\max\{a^bb^cc^a,a^cb^ac^b\}$ . To prove this, assume $a>b>c$ , and notice that $$\frac{a^ab^bc^c}{a^bb^cc^a}>\frac{a^bb^ac^c}{a^bb^cc^a}=\frac{b^ac^c}{b^cc^a}=\Big(\frac{b}{c}\Big)^{a-c}>1$$ and $$\frac{a^ab^bc^c}{a^cb^ac^b}>\frac{a^bb^ac^c}{a^cb^ac^b}=\frac{a^bc^c}{a^cc^b}=\Big(\frac{a}{c}\Big)^{b-c}>1.$$ If mutually distinct $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}^+$ in general, denoted by $a_0,a_1,a_2$ respectively, we could let bijective mapping $\sigma:\{0,1,2\}\to\{0,1,2\}$ be a permutation of 0,1,2 such that $a_{\sigma(0)}>a_{\sigma(1)}>a_{\sigma(2)}$ so that now $$a_0^{a_0}a_1^{a_1}a_2^{a_2}=a_{\sigma(0)}^{a_{\sigma(0)}}a_{\sigma(1)}^{a_{\sigma(1)}}a_{\sigma(2)}^{a_{\sigma(2)}}>a_0^{a_{(0\space+_3\space k)}}a_1^{a_{(1\space+_3\space k)}}a_2^{a_{(2\space+_3\space k)}}$$ where $k=1$ or $2$ and $+_3$ denotes the addition in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ . Notice that this is possible because at the rightmost expression the exponent of $a_i$ is $a_j$ for some $j\neq i$ and notice that for $n=3$ , if a bijective mapping $\sigma:\{0,1,2\}\to\{0,1,2\}$ has the property $\sigma(i)\neq i$ for $i=0,1,2$ , then (by listing out all permutations of $(1,2,3)$ ) we can lead to the conclusion that $\sigma(i)=(i\space+_3\space k)\space\forall i=0,1,2$ for $k=1$ or $2$ . My conjecture For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , for $a_0,\cdots,a_{n-1}$ , must we have $$\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i^{a_i}>\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i^{a_{\sigma(i)}}$$ where $\sigma:\{0,\cdots,n-1\}\to\{0,\cdots,n-1\}$ is any bijective map such that $\exists i: \sigma(i)\neq i$ . Also, if we relax the condition that $\exists i: \sigma(i)\neq i$ , maybe we can replace the $>$ by $\ge$ and the inequality still holds? Notice that the conjecture says that product of at least 2 power of mutually distinct positive real numbers to itself will be strictly reduced when the exponents are re-arranged, which is quite interesting to my point of view. More about it I have tried to generalize the case for $n>3$ by considering a sequence of swapping so that $(0,\cdots,n-1)$ is changed to $\big(\sigma(0),\cdots,\sigma(n-1)\big)$ , and hoping that we can use $a^ab^b>a^bb^a$ to prove the conjecture step by step. However, consider the following example: Example making me frustrated: For $n=6$ , let $\sigma(i)=5,2,3,1,0,4$ for $i=0,1,\cdots,5$ respectively. Denote mutually distinct positive real numbers $a_0,\cdots,a_{5}$ by $a,b,c,d,e,f$ respectively, and we hope that we can prove: $$a^ab^bc^cd^de^ef^f>a^fb^cc^dd^be^af^e.$$ We may first swap the 4-th and 5-th terms so that $a^ab^bc^cd^de^ef^f>a^ab^bc^cd^de^ff^e$ .

81,System of Equations and Pumpkins? I Think Not.,System of Equations and Pumpkins? I Think Not.,,"Here is a challenge problem my math teacher gave to his pre-calculus class. I saw it. I attempted it. And I failed. It's sort of bothering me because my teacher said, ""It's simpler than you're making it out to be."" That sort of bothered me even though I know he's right. Anyways, time for the problem. It is as follows: ""A pumpkin growing contest occurs every year in Half Moon Bay. The pumpkins are weighed to see who grew the heaviest one. One individual decided to weigh his 5 pumpkins two at a time. He recorded the following waits: 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, and 121. How much did each pumpkin weigh?"" This is my attempt. Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ be the weights of the pumpkins in increasing order, i.e. such that $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le a_4 \le a_5.$ If we take the sum of the 10 distinct weighings  then we will have four times the sum of the weights of the pumpkins. In other words, $$110 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 120 + 121 = 1156$$ which is equivalent to, $$(a_1+a_2)+(a_1+a_3)+(a_1+a_4)+(a_1+a_5)+(a_2+a_3)+(a_2+a_4)+(a_2+a_5)+(a_3+a_4)+(a_3+a_5)+(a_4+a_5).$$ So we have $$ 4(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5) = 1156$$ $$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5 = 289.$$ Since $a_1, a_2$ weigh the least their sum must weigh the least, so $a_1+a_2 = 110.$ By similar reasoning we can see that $a_4+a_5 =121.$ Now we can see that $a_3=58.$ This ends my attempt. I tried to go further but I couldn't. One person told me that it could be solved by system of equations but I thought that systems of equations might be troublesome because the problem does not specify which pairs of pumpkins correspond to which weights. But I don't doubt that it can be solved with systems of equations. Any solutions would be much appreciated! Many thanks to all!","Here is a challenge problem my math teacher gave to his pre-calculus class. I saw it. I attempted it. And I failed. It's sort of bothering me because my teacher said, ""It's simpler than you're making it out to be."" That sort of bothered me even though I know he's right. Anyways, time for the problem. It is as follows: ""A pumpkin growing contest occurs every year in Half Moon Bay. The pumpkins are weighed to see who grew the heaviest one. One individual decided to weigh his 5 pumpkins two at a time. He recorded the following waits: 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, and 121. How much did each pumpkin weigh?"" This is my attempt. Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ be the weights of the pumpkins in increasing order, i.e. such that $a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le a_4 \le a_5.$ If we take the sum of the 10 distinct weighings  then we will have four times the sum of the weights of the pumpkins. In other words, $$110 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 120 + 121 = 1156$$ which is equivalent to, $$(a_1+a_2)+(a_1+a_3)+(a_1+a_4)+(a_1+a_5)+(a_2+a_3)+(a_2+a_4)+(a_2+a_5)+(a_3+a_4)+(a_3+a_5)+(a_4+a_5).$$ So we have $$ 4(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5) = 1156$$ $$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5 = 289.$$ Since $a_1, a_2$ weigh the least their sum must weigh the least, so $a_1+a_2 = 110.$ By similar reasoning we can see that $a_4+a_5 =121.$ Now we can see that $a_3=58.$ This ends my attempt. I tried to go further but I couldn't. One person told me that it could be solved by system of equations but I thought that systems of equations might be troublesome because the problem does not specify which pairs of pumpkins correspond to which weights. But I don't doubt that it can be solved with systems of equations. Any solutions would be much appreciated! Many thanks to all!",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'systems-of-equations']"

In this exercise, the reader is asked to prove that for all natural numbers $n$ and $p$, there exist real numbers $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_p$ such that:   $$ \sum_{k = 1}^n k^p ~=~ \frac{n^{p + 1}}{p + 1} + \sum_{i = 1}^p \alpha_in^i$$ The attempted proof of the identity that I devised uses the binomial theorem with $p$ and $n$ fixed, but does not use complete induction. The proof of the identity provided by Spivak uses the binomial theorem with $n$ fixed, but uses complete induction on $p$ to complete the proof. What follows is my attempted proof. In this proof, I apply $(x + 1)^{y + 1}$ and $(n + 1)^{p + 1}$ to the binomial theorem in order to derive the first and second terms of the sum on the left-hand side of the identity to be proved. First, note that applying $(x + 1)^{y + 1}$ to the binomial theorem, where $x$ is a real number and $y$ a natural number, demonstrates that the predicate $\phi(x,y)$ is true for all real numbers $x$ and natural numbers $y$:   $$ \phi(x,y) ~\equiv~ (x + 1)^{y + 1} - x^{y + 1} ~=~ (y + 1)x^y + \sum_{i = 0}^{y - 1} {y + 1 \choose i} x^i$$ Now, suppose that $n$ and $p$ are natural numbers. Then the sum of the left-hand sides of the identities $\phi(k,p)$ and the sum of the right-hand sides of the identities $\phi(k,p)$, for $k = 1,\ldots,n$, are equal:   $$(n + 1)^{p + 1} - 1 ~=~ \sum_{k = 1}^n (p + 1)k^p + \sum_{k = 1}^n \left ( \sum_{i = 0}^{p - 1} {p + 1 \choose i} k^i \right )$$ Rewriting $(n + 1)^{p + 1}$ using the identity $\phi(n,p)$ and dividing both sides of the identity by $p + 1$ gives   $$ \sum_{i = 1}^n k^p ~=~ \frac{n^{p + 1}}{p + 1} + \sum_{i = 0}^p {p + 1 \choose i} \left ( \frac{1}{p + 1}\right ) n^i - \left [\frac{1}{p + 1} + \sum_{k = 1}^n \left ( \sum_{i = 0}^{p - 1} {p + 1 \choose i} \frac{k^i}{p + 1} \right ) \right ] $$ Assuming that I didn't make any algebraic errors, I have shown that there are $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_p$ such that the sum of the $p$th powers of the first $n$ natural numbers can be written in the required way. On the other hand, Spivak derives an identity containing the sums of the $r$th powers of the first $n$ natural numbers, for $r \leq p$, then applies an induction hypothesis to obtain the case for $p + 1$. I'm not sure if my proof is wrong, and whether I am missing something that would require a proof by induction. Is there an error? For reference: I wrote functions that compute the sum of the $p$h power of the first $n$ numbers, and a version of the last identity derived before expanding $(n + 1)^{p + 1}$ using $\phi(n,p)$ in Haskell. Both computed the same numbers for all values of $n \leq 100$ and $p \leq 10$, so for a few numbers there seems to be no problem.

Prove that $$\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b^2+8ca}}+ \frac{c}{\sqrt{c^2+8ab}} \geqslant 1.$$ I tried to follow the proposed solution for this which depended on Hölder's inequality, but I'm a bit confused about how they came up with the expression. How I remember Hölder's is that it states that $$\sum_{i=1}^n |x_iy_i| \leqslant (\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i|^p)^{1/p}(\sum_{i=1}^n|y_i|^q)^{1/q}$$ and we need the same Conjugate property as in Young's inequality $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} =1.$ What they had was $$(\sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}})(\sum \frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+8bc}})(\sum a(a^2+8bc)) \geqslant (a+b+c)^3.$$ From here it was quite straightforward, but any clarification on how we can get this result from Hölder's would be appreciated.","Let .

Now if you had a right triangle with sides $a$ and $b$, it's hypotenuse would be the square root of $a^2 + b^2$.
