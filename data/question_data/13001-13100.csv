For example, let's take the simple equation $$y=12x^2+24x+45$$ An alternative notation for the same thing would be: $$f(x)=12x^2+24x+45$$ Here we merely substituted $y$ for $f(x)$ . It means the same thing. If memory serves me right, when we take the first derivative of this function, we have three ways we can write it: $$y'=24x+24$$ $$f'(x)=24x+24$$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=24x+24$$ Now, it's this third notation that I'm talking about here. To my understanding the $\frac{dy}{dx}$ doesn't really mean anything by itself. It's just another way to specify that we're talking about a derivative of a function, just like the $'$ in the other two notations. But then sometimes I come across an equation like this : $$m\frac{\text{d}^2\mathbf{r}}{\text{d}t^2} = \frac{kqq'}{|\mathbf{r}|^2},$$ And here suddenly the $d$ is being treated like a variable, not to mention the $t$ and... And if memory serves me right, I've seen ever more extreme examples where the fraction $\frac{dy}{dx}$ itself is taken apart and each of the components used as a variable. I think this was popular back in university when I was talking course on differential equations. Barely passed that, half of it didn't make sense, and this was a large part of the reason why.

First, I use the AM-GM inequality and hence obtain that: $ \frac{2023}{n} \geq {\left(s_1\cdot s_2\cdot s_3 \cdots s_n\right)}^{\frac{1}{n}}.$ For the maximum to be achieved, $s_r = \frac{2023}{n} \ \ \ \forall \ r \leq n$ , each of which I call $s$ .

So I suppose that we can use the integer $3$ which is closest to $e$ and use it fill up the set $S$ . But $2023$ is not divisible by $3$ , so all of $s \in S$ can not be $3$ .
