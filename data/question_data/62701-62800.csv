1,Permutations of {1 .. n} where {1 .. k} are not adjacent,Permutations of {1 .. n} where {1 .. k} are not adjacent,,"The Problem: So I was thinking up some simple combinatorics problems, and this one stumped me. Let N be the set of numbers $\{1 .. n\}$, or any set of cardinality $n$ Let K be the set of numbers $\{1 .. k\}$ where $k < n$, or any subset of N of cardinality $k$ How many permutations of N exist such that no two members of set k are adjacent? Here was my basic approach: Solutions = Permutations of N - Permutations of N that contain a pair in K Permutations of N = nPn = n! Every item in K will occur in each permutation of N so we loop through: You place down one item of K  Possibilities where the next is in K = K - 1  You place down an item of K   possibilities where next is in k = k-2  ...  You place the last item in K The total permutations with a pair would therefore be: $  (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 0 $ However, many of those entries are duplicates, so we have to rule out instances where two of those pairs occurred in one set, and then again rule out instances that occurred three times, up pairs occurred k times I think the amount with two pairs would best be found by getting the amount with one pair minus the amount with no more. To do this I would loop as: You place two items in K There are k-2 chances the next item is in k You place an item in K There are k-3 chances the next item is in k ... You place your last item in K Total permutations with two pairs $= (k - 2) + (k - 3) + ... + 0$ Total permutations with three pairs $= (k - 3) + (k - 4) + ... + 0$ And so on.. And at this point I know I am incorrect, because I would get a total of: $( (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 0 ) - ( (k-2) + (k-3) + ... + 0 ) - ( (k-3) + (k-4) + ... + 0 ) + ... + 0$ permutations that contain pairs. This number is waaay negative... As I pointed out at the end of that, my solution finds a negative amount of permutations that have pairs in them, and so it is clearly wrong. If someone could explain my error, or else show a better way to approach the problem, I would greatly appreciate it.

This is well-known and easy enough to see.  We can just count permutations with a cycle of length $k$ and divide by $n!$ .  This is made easier by the fact that any permutation has at most one cycle of length $k > n/2$ . Take an $n$ -element set $X$ .   Choosing a permutation of $X$ with a cycle of length $k$ is the same as choosing a $k$ -element subset $S \subseteq X$ , a cyclic ordering on $S$ , and an arbitrary permutation of $X - S$ . There are $\binom{n}{k}$ choices of $S$ , $(k-1)!$ cyclic orderings on $S$ , and $(n-k)!$ permutations of $X - S$ .   Multiplying these, we get $$  \binom{n}{k} (k-1)! (n-k)! = \frac{n! (k-1)! (n-k)!}{k! (n-k)!} = \frac{n!}{k}  $$ Dividing by $n!$ we get $1/k$ as desired.

However, a friend of mine showed me a puzzle game, and he said that it's always possible to win this game, even though it seems unlikely to me. I will explain the rules, which are pretty simple, and I want to know how I could prove this, or if the answer is evident using combinatorics. Here's how the game works: The game is a slight variation of a game called 'Poker Squares'. Anyway, you lay down (all at once) 25 random cards arranged in a 5x5 grid (no jokers). The goal of the game is to arrange all the cards so that each row is a poker hand of the following: A straight: 5 cards arranged in order of their number (i.e. 9,10,J,Q,K, irregardless of their suite.) A flush: any 5 cards in any order of the same suite (i.e. five hearts) A full house: A triple and a double (i.e. three 10's and two J's.) A straight flush: 5 cards of the same suite arranged in increasing or decreasing order (i.e. 4,5,6,7,8 all diamonds) And thats it. The claim is that given any random 25 cards, these cards can ALWAYS be arranged so that each row is a winning poker hand (of the above mentioned hands only).

However, a friend of mine showed me a puzzle game, and he said that it's always possible to win this game, even though it seems unlikely to me. I will explain the rules, which are pretty simple, and I want to know how I could prove this, or if the answer is evident using combinatorics. Here's how the game works: The game is a slight variation of a game called 'Poker Squares'. Anyway, you lay down (all at once) 25 random cards arranged in a 5x5 grid (no jokers). The goal of the game is to arrange all the cards so that each row is a poker hand of the following: A straight: 5 cards arranged in order of their number (i.e. 9,10,J,Q,K, irregardless of their suite.) A flush: any 5 cards in any order of the same suite (i.e. five hearts) A full house: A triple and a double (i.e. three 10's and two J's.)
