Show that $\left| N \cap Z(G) \right| > 1.$ Proof. Let $a \ast n = C_a(n) = ana^{-1}$ for $a \in G$ and $n \in N$. Since $1 \ast n = C_1(n) = n$ for all $n \in N$ and $a \ast (b \ast n) = C_a(C_b(n)) = (C_a \circ C_b)(n)   = C_a(bnb^{-1}) = abnb^{-1}a^{-1} = abn(ab)^{-1} = C_{ab}(n) = (ab) \ast n.$ It follows that $\ast$ is an action of $G$ on $N$ by conjugation. Let $N^G$ denote the set of $G$-fixed points and note that $N^G  = N \cap Z(G)$ (Since the elements that commute with $G$ are invariant under conjugation). Thus, we obtain $| Z(G) \cap N | \equiv | N | \equiv 0 \mod p$. This implies that $p$ divides $| Z(G) \cap N |$, and so $|Z(G) \cap N| \geqslant p > 1$.

While it makes sense to me that the above definition comes in handy when trying to verify this, I am still absolutely puzzled about how to work with it. Let me try to elaborate on my confusion (this might get tedious for a trained Mathematician). I am aware that in (higher) mathematics the simple notation of $na$ has absolutely no meaning whatsoever until we give meaning to it by a definition . Since we have done this with the above, one could mean that it is possible to work with it and show certain properties. One of my tutors however meant that it's not clever to write $na$ as in the definition above, it would be better to define it recursively by a sum, because $$na=  \underbrace{a+\dots + a}_{n-\text{times}} \tag{*} $$ isn't mathematically rigorous and again, has in that context no meaning.

However with this definition I manage to show for example the distributivity law only for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (by induction). For negative values of $n$ I would say that $|n|= -n$ which is again a positive number and try induction over $p=|n|$, but there nothing seems to work. Let $p=1$ then $$\sum_{i=1}^1 (x+y)=\left(\sum_{i=1}^0(-(x+y)\right)+(-(x+y)) = (-(x+y)) $$ and I have no chance to continue with this. Is my definition wrong or do I just apply it in a flawed way?

Show that $|g|$ is finite. Proof. Consider the set of powers of $g$ , that is, $X = \{g^n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ . Note that this set is in bijection with $\Bbb N$ , hence it is infinite. But $G$ is finite by assumption, so the elements of $X$ cannot all be distinct. In particular, let $m,k\in\Bbb N$ such that $g^m = g^{m+k}$ and $k$ is the smallest natural number with this property.

Given a second number $k\in\mathbb N$ I'm looking for subsets of $k$ elements from $\mathbb Z_m$ such that no pair-wise difference occurs more than once. More formally, I'm looking for some $A\subset\mathbb Z_m$ with $\lvert A\rvert=k$ and $$\forall a,b,c\in A: \lvert\{a,b,c\}\rvert=3\rightarrow a+b-c\not\in A\pmod m$$ Is there a name for such a kind of set? I guess it might be somehow related to Golomb rulers , but the cyclic nature is not common to rulers as far as I know. Is there a known method to efficiently enumerate such sets for given $m$ and $k$? Is there a known theorem concerning the existence of such subsets for specific $m$ and $k$?

To do this I need to define a non trivial homomorphism $\varphi:G_2 \rightarrow Aut(G_1)$. We know that $Aut(G_1) \cong GL(2,p)$ ($2 \times 2$ invertible matrices over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$). I know one non trivial homomorphism $\varphi: G_2 \rightarrow GL(2,p)$ which is defined as follows: $(1,0) \mapsto  \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1  \\ 0 & 1  \\ \end{array} \right)$  and $(0,1) \mapsto \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0  \\ 0 & 1  \\ \end{array} \right)$. This will give me one non trivial semi direct product of $G_1$ and $G_2$. I want to ask, Is there any other non trivial homomorphism $\varphi$ which gives me a non abelian group of order $p^4$ which is not isomorphic to what I have produced?",,['group-theory']

My question is about the connected sum of to knots and the Alexanderpolynomial belongs to de connected sum. I can prove with the definition via the Seifertmatrix that $$\Delta_{K_1\oplus K_2}(t)=\Delta_{K_1}\Delta_{K_2}$$ Thats not so difficult because the loops on the Seifertsurfaces are disjoint. But now i want to to it via the Wirtinger presentation and Fox calculus . Surely you may find the same result, but how to make a conclusion over the Wirtinger presentation of the connected sum?! Is it just the addition of the relations of how to handle this problem?? Can someone help me with this question? Thank you!","Hello :) i have just reading the question ""How to compute the Alexander polynomial of general torus knot"" and i was suprised how strong it works if someone have a difficult question. I am also very interested in kont theory, very wonderful topic, but sometimes there are strong questions. There are many definitions how to compute the alexanderpolynomial (Fox calculus, via Dehn presentation, via Wirtinger presentation and other combinatorical definition - these are all equivalent definitions (but thats another topic to ask :D).
