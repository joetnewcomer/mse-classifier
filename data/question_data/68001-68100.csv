A000332 has the comment: Also the number of equilateral triangles with vertices in an equilateral triangular array of points with n rows (offset 1), with any orientation. The linked solution is insightful, but the proof is very mechanical. I tried to write an inductive proof, but I'm unable to come up with a nice way to prove the final identity (in particular for $n \geq 4$): $$\binom{n + 3}{4} = n + 3 \binom{n + 2}{4} - 3 \binom{n + 1}{4} + \binom{n}{4}$$. Wolfram|Alpha admits that these are indeed equal , and this could certainly be shown by writing everything as a polynomial.

If we lose one of them in series and if we want it to recover,  We just need to store $y_1$ that is  same size like the items in series. $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2 \oplus x_3 \oplus ... \oplus x_n$$ where $\oplus$ is the XOR binary operator. Because $\oplus$ can be defined $$ x \oplus x =0 $$ $$ x \oplus 0 =x $$ $$ 0 \oplus x =x $$ $$ x \oplus y = y \oplus x  $$ $$ (x \oplus y) \oplus y =x \oplus (y \oplus y) = x \oplus 0 = x $$ Let's assume that we lost $x_1$. We just need to apply $n-1$ xor operations to recover $x_1$ $$y_1 \oplus  x_2 \oplus x_3 \oplus ... \oplus x_n =x_1$$ My question: if we lose k items in ($x_1,x_2,x_3,.....,x_n$ )  , How can the k lost items be recovered? What are the minimum number of spare items $y_1,y_2,..,y_m$ required to recover the k lost items? Which binary operators and algorithm should be used to recover the k lost  items in series? My attempt to solve 2 lost items :($k=2$) I do not know if they are minimum or not, I used $\oplus$ operator for now. I put my approach without proof below. for $n=3$; We need minimum 2 store places.  $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2 $$ $$y_2=x_2 \oplus x_3 $$ for $n=4$; We need minimum 3 store places.  $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2   $$ $$y_2=x_2 \oplus x_3  $$ $$y_3=x_4 \oplus x_1  $$ for $n=5$; We need minimum 3 store places.  $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2  \oplus x_3  $$ $$y_2=x_2 \oplus x_3  \oplus x_4  $$ $$y_3=x_3 \oplus x_4  \oplus x_5  $$ for $n=6$; We need minimum 3 store places.  $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2  \oplus x_3  $$ $$y_2=x_3 \oplus x_4  \oplus x_5  $$ $$y_3=x_5 \oplus x_6  \oplus x_1  $$ for $n=7$; I have just found minimum 3 store places.  $$y_1=x_1 \oplus x_2  \oplus x_3 \oplus x_4 $$ $$y_2=x_3 \oplus x_4  \oplus x_5 \oplus x_6 $$ $$y_3=x_6 \oplus x_7  \oplus x_1 \oplus x_3 $$ I believe if we can solve the problem for 2 lost items , It can be generalized for k lost items. The problem is also very related with combinatorics. I would like to get comments how to approach to the general problem .

I like the idea of a hexagon-tile setup (a la Catan). There would be some number of different resource categories; I'm trying to determine how many. Each tile would have a number from 1 to 6 associated with each resource category, representing the number you'd have to meet or beat when rolling a D6 to acquire that resource. And you'd get one die roll per resource type. In the interest of fairness, I'd like each tile to have the same total value -- probably the floor of the expected roll value times the number of different resources. So, for example, if I only had one resource type (let's call it Resource A), then I'd want each tile to have a total value of 3, which trivially means that I'd have one unique type of tile, which had a value of 3 for Resource A. One die rolls that value in exactly one way. If I had two resource types, Resource A and Resource B, then I'd want the total value of each tile to be 7.

94,Dealing with Generating Functions accurately,Dealing with Generating Functions accurately,,"I'm currently working through Iven Niven's ""Mathematics of Choice."" In the chapter on Generating Functions, the exercises include problems like: How many solutions in non-negative integers does the equation $2x+3y+7z+9r=20$ have? This of course ends up being the same as finding the coefficient of $x^{20}$ in $(1+x^2+x^4+x^6+\cdots+x^{20})(1+x^3+x^6+\cdots+x^{18})(1+x^7+x^{14})(1+x^9+x^{18})$. Maybe I'm just being a big weenie, but dealing with polynomials this large ends up being really tedious and error-prone. I've realized that you can save the most involved multiplication for last, since that requires the least detail, and I'm of course not bothering to keep track of any powers greater than the one I'm interested in. Any tips for keeping these giant polynomials manageable?","I'm currently working through Iven Niven's ""Mathematics of Choice.""

99,What's the factor of $x^{40} $ in $(1+x^4+x^5)^{100}$?,What's the factor of  in ?,x^{40}  (1+x^4+x^5)^{100},"I'm studying this problem but it gets complicated after a few steps, can someone add some feedback between them? Additional information to the problem: Observe that equation $4i + 5j = 40$ has as integer solutions: $(i,j) \in \{ (0,8), (5,4), (10,0) \}$ Steps: We know that: $$ (s+t)^n = \sum\limits_{r=0}^n {{n}\choose{r}} s^rt^{n-r}$$ For $s = x^5$ and $t = 1+x^4$: $$(1 + x^4 + x^5)^{100} = \sum\limits_{r=0}^{100} {{100}\choose{r}} x^{5r} (1+x^4)^{100-r} \implies \bigstar $$ This is supposed to be an intermediate step that uses again the first rule for analyzing $(1+x^4)^{100-r}$:    $$(1+x^4)^{100-j} = \sum\limits_{\textbf{k=0}}^{\textbf{100-r}} {{100-r}\choose{k}} x^{4k}$$   I think there is a typo in the presentation and the correct one is:   $$(1+x^4)^{100-r} = \sum\limits_{\textbf{k=0}}^{\textbf{100-r}} {{100-r}\choose{k}} x^{4k}$$ Using the above we get to: $$\bigstar \implies (1+x^4+x^5)^{100} = \sum\limits_{\textbf{r=0}}^{\textbf{100}} {{100}\choose{r}} x^{5r} \sum\limits_{\textbf{k=0}}^{\textbf{100-r}} {{100-r}\choose{k}} x^{4k}$$ In order to compute $x^{40}$'s factor we have to choose $k$ and $r$ so that $4k + 5r = 40$, with $k$ and $r$ positive integers less than 100. They are computed for us in the beginning, so the factor of $x^{40}$ is: $$ {{100}\choose{8}} {{92}\choose{0}} + {{100}\choose{4}}{{96}\choose{5}} + {{100}\choose{0}} {{100}\choose{10}}$$ Question: How do we get the last step? (I know that $C(n,r)$ is the formula to find the factor but this is a little bit more complicated (e.g. the sums have different counters) ).","I'm studying this problem but it gets complicated after a few steps, can someone add some feedback between them?
