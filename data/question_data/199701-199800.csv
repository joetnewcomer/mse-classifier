I've calculated the second fundamental form, I think correctly since I did it myself and my result matches what's in the book (it's a worked example).

As you can (perhaps) see, my ""osculating paraboloid"" doesn't osculate very nicely. In fact, the point p, at which it's calculated, isn't even on it at all. Nevertheless, when I move p around I can see the paraboloid doing something sensible, and ""nearly right"".

14,Is the identification between symmetric tensors and homogeneous polynomials useful?,Is the identification between symmetric tensors and homogeneous polynomials useful?,,"The general question: Given an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $k$, there exists an identification  $$\mathrm{Sym}^d(V) \sim k[x_1, \dots, x_n]_d$$ between the space of symmetric order $d$ tensors on $V$ and the space of order $d$ homogeneous polynomials in $n$ indeterminates over $k$. I am wondering whether this identification is ever of much use in the study of tensors and tensor fields. In particular, I am interested in ways in which this identification might simplify problems in differential geometry, but uses in other fields would be interesting also.

Additionally, we have the following system of equations: $$ \begin{align} \phi(\omega) \cdot \eta + \phi(\eta) \cdot \omega &= \nu_1 \\ \phi(\omega) \cdot \theta + \phi(\theta) \cdot \omega &= \nu_2  \end{align} $$ Our goal is to solve for $\omega$.

I haven't seen this formula anywhere in several papers/books on Riemannian geometry I've read and it made me think I've done some mistake while deriving this formula. Here is what I've done: consider function $$\tilde{F}(v) = \operatorname{d exp}^{-1}_{p} \vert_{\operatorname{exp}(v)} \circ F \circ \operatorname{exp}_p(v).$$ It is a function from $T_p\mathcal{M}$ to $T_p\mathcal{M}$, so we can use standart Taylor formula for expansion around $0$: $$\tilde{F}(v) = \tilde{F}(0) + \operatorname{d}\tilde{F} \vert_{0}(v) + \operatorname{d}^2\tilde{F} \vert_{0}(v, v) + o(||v||_p^2).$$ Now we'll show that $\operatorname{d}\tilde{F}\vert_{0} = \nabla_pF$. By the chain rule we have $$\operatorname{d}\tilde{F}\vert_{0} = \operatorname{d}\big(\operatorname{d exp}^{-1}_{p} \vert_{\operatorname{exp_p}(0)}\big)\vert_{F \circ \operatorname{exp_p}(0)} \circ \operatorname{d}F \vert_{\operatorname{exp_p}(0)} \circ \operatorname d \operatorname{exp_p}  \vert_{0}.$$ Since $\operatorname{d} \operatorname{exp_p}  \vert_{0} = \operatorname{Id}$ and since by invere function theorem $\operatorname{d exp}_p^{-1} \vert_{\exp_p(0)} = (\operatorname{d exp}_p \vert_{0})^{-1} = \operatorname{Id}^{-1} = \operatorname{Id}$, we have $$\operatorname{d}\tilde{F} \vert_{0} = \operatorname{d}F\vert_{exp_p(0)} = \operatorname{d}F \vert_{p}.$$ As I understand, $\operatorname{d}F \vert_p = \nabla_pF$ (this is the point of my doubts). Therefore, $\operatorname{d}^{i}F \vert_p = \nabla^{i}_pF$. So, $$\operatorname{d exp}^{-1}_{p} \vert_{\operatorname{exp}(v)} \circ F \circ \operatorname{exp}_p(v) = \tilde{F}(0) + \nabla_pF(v) + \nabla^2_pF(v, v) + o(||v||^2_p).$$ After using inverse function theorem and equality $\tilde{F}(0)=F(p)$ we get first expression. So I have following questions: is this formula wrong and if yes, where am I wrong and can someone tell me some source where analogous result is derived? UPDATE: I've found at least one mistake in above formulas (which may be the cause of absence of curvature tensor mentioned by Yuri in comments). It is the wrong use of the chain rule. Since $\operatorname{d exp}_p^{-1} \vert_{v}$ depends on $v$, differential of $\tilde{F}$ should look like this I guess (by the analogy with $\mathbb{R}^n$ case): $$\operatorname{d}\tilde{F}\vert_{0} = \operatorname{d}h\vert_{0} \circ F \circ \operatorname{exp_p(0)} + h(0) \circ \operatorname{d}F \vert_{\operatorname{exp_p}(0)} \circ \operatorname d \operatorname{exp_p}  \vert_{0},$$ where h  = $\operatorname{d exp}_p^{-1} \vert_{v}$. But this is only a guess, I cannot justify it using properties of $\nabla$.

35,motivating the conservation of symplectic area by way of general (coordinate) covariance,motivating the conservation of symplectic area by way of general (coordinate) covariance,,"I'm trying to motivate why a symplectic structure captures exactly the right structure one needs to do classical mechanics. The easiest part of this story goes like this: we need a procedure for turning a Hamiltonian into a vector field, the integral curves of which will foliate phase space into orbits. Of course, this criterion alone isn't enough; there are many structures that can fulfill this sort of need -- any old rank-2 tensor field might do. Most people who have read about symplectic geometry on the internet probably know how Henry Cohn fills in the extra details, here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cohn/Thoughts/symplectic.html The hardest part of the motivation, I think, is explaining why the tensor field that converts the Hamiltonian differential dH into a vector field needs to be alternating. Cohn tells a nice story about how conservation of energy along the flows of a Hamiltonian vector field forces the tensor to be alternating. But I'm wondering whether there isn't an alternative -- perhaps more general -- story to tell, by way of general covariance. Couldn't we just say that if we want Hamilton's equations to be formally invariant under a smooth coordinate change, we need the symplectic area form to be conserved? As I understand it, a ""canonical transformation"" is just a diffeomorphism of phase space coordinates that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant, and Poincare showed that a diffeomorphism is a canonical transformation if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form. My question is -- is all of this right? Is the definition of ""canonical transformation"" really just ""diffeomorphism that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant,"" and is it true that a diffeomorphism on phase space is canonical if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form? It seems to me that this is a much more straightforward way to motivate the at first bizarre-seeming symplectic formalism than is usually given -- because it falls right out of a more general physical principle, diffeomorphism invariance. In other words, it's a top-down motivation (we need symplectic area to be conserved if we're going to be covariant), instead of an unilluminating bottom-up motivation (look, symplectic area happens to be conserved, so we should do everything with a symplectic 2-form!).","I'm trying to motivate why a symplectic structure captures exactly the right structure one needs to do classical mechanics.

Most people who have read about symplectic geometry on the internet probably know how Henry Cohn fills in the extra details, here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cohn/Thoughts/symplectic.html The hardest part of the motivation, I think, is explaining why the tensor field that converts the Hamiltonian differential dH into a vector field needs to be alternating. Cohn tells a nice story about how conservation of energy along the flows of a Hamiltonian vector field forces the tensor to be alternating. But I'm wondering whether there isn't an alternative -- perhaps more general -- story to tell, by way of general covariance. Couldn't we just say that if we want Hamilton's equations to be formally invariant under a smooth coordinate change, we need the symplectic area form to be conserved? As I understand it, a ""canonical transformation"" is just a diffeomorphism of phase space coordinates that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant, and Poincare showed that a diffeomorphism is a canonical transformation if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form. My question is -- is all of this right? Is the definition of ""canonical transformation"" really just ""diffeomorphism that leaves Hamilton's equations invariant,"" and is it true that a diffeomorphism on phase space is canonical if and only if it preserves the symplectic area form? It seems to me that this is a much more straightforward way to motivate the at first bizarre-seeming symplectic formalism than is usually given -- because it falls right out of a more general physical principle, diffeomorphism invariance. In other words, it's a top-down motivation (we need symplectic area to be conserved if we're going to be covariant), instead of an unilluminating bottom-up motivation (look, symplectic area happens to be conserved, so we should do everything with a symplectic 2-form!).",,"['differential-geometry', 'soft-question', 'mathematical-physics', 'classical-mechanics', 'symplectic-geometry']"

Then this is a smooth map (if I am not mistaken about the definition of a smooth action). Now I assume that $p$ is free (i.e it is moved by all elements) so that $\phi_p$ is invertible because it is 1-1. I now prove that its differential is injective. Let $\gamma(t)$ be any curve in $G$ then $$\#(\xi)_p = (\phi_{p})_{*} \left(\left.\frac{d}{dt}(\gamma(t))\right|_{t=0}\right) = \left.\frac{d}{dt}\phi_p(\gamma(t))\right|_{t=0}.$$ But since $p$ is free (i.e fundamental vector field generated by every element is non-zero in some nbd) $\phi_p(\gamma(t))$ is a smooth curve with non-zero tangent. Therefore $(\phi_{p})_{*}$ has zero kernel at this point. Then does this mean that dimension of the lie algebra and hence the lie group should be smaller than or equal to the dimension of the manifold?
