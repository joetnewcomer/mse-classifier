My Solution So Far: Here's what I've got for a non-Poisson kernel solution: We want to find a harmonic conjugate for $u$ in the punctured disk, and then we can apply big Picard to show that $0$ is a removable singularity. The problem is that the punctured disc is not simply connected. If we take $\sigma = (u \circ \exp)(z): L \to \mathbb{C}$, where $L$ is the left half-plane, now we have $\sigma$ harmonic, and defined in a simply connected set $L$, so it has a harmonic conjugate $\tau$. Now we wish to take $v = (\tau \circ \log):\{0 < |z| < \rho\}\to \mathbb{C}$, but in order to do so we need $\tau$ to be $2\pi i$-periodic. This is where my proof breaks down. One of the similar problems which readers referred me to used the following strategy: note that since $\sigma$ is $2\pi i$-periodic, and $\sigma, \tau$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we have that $\nabla\tau(z) = \nabla\tau(z + 2 \pi i)$ for all $z\in L$, or in other words, $\tau(z) - \tau(z+2\pi i)$ is a constant function, say, equal to $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, the solution suggests, we can set $$g(z) = u + iv - \frac{c}{2\pi}z,$$ in order to make $g$ $2\pi i$-periodic, and then we can use $(g\circ \log)$ on $\{0 < |z| < \rho\}$. But the reason why this won't work for my purposes is: now we have changed $u$! On the other hand, we can't simply subtract $\frac{c}{2\pi}\Im{(z)}$, and try to leave $u$ untouched, because now $g$ is not analytic. How can we get around this? Another strategy entirely might be to try to use the mean-value property. Ahlfors discusses that a lot in the preceding section, and his main example is the punctured disc.

21,Multiplying Laurent series,Multiplying Laurent series,,"I was solving the following problem from Bak & Newmans Complex Analysis (Chp. 9 # 12b): Find the Laurent series (in powers of z) for $$\frac{1}{z(z-1)(z-2)}$$ in the open annulus $1 < |z| < 2$ . I worked out the solution in a couple of ways. The first way used partial fraction decomposition then plugged in the Laurent series for $\frac{1}{z-1}$ and $\frac{1}{z-2}$ . After the first method seemed to work out, I thought I'd try to get the answer without using the partial fraction decomposition, but instead directly multiply (like a Cauchy product) the Laurent series for $\frac{1}{z-1}$ and $\frac{1}{z-2}$ . The second method gave the same answer as the first method, but I feel like I did some illegal sleight of hand. Taking the Cauchy product of power series involves evaluating a finite sum to get a coefficient. But performing an analogous operation for Laurent series can involve trying to sum an infinite series to find a coefficient. Are there any useful conditions that guarantee that this kind of formal product does what you expect it to - meaning that the sum/series that defines each coefficient converges and that the resulting Laurent series itself converges to the product of the values of the original two series? I was guessing that maybe you might be allowed to multiply two Laurent series on an annulus (if there is one) where they both converge. I thought this might work for the following reason: Let $f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}a_n(z-z_0)^n$ , $g(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_n(z-z_0)^n$ , and say they both converge on the same annulus around some point $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ . The product $f(z)g(z)$ is also analytic in the annulus, and so should have a Laurent series in that domain where the coefficient $c_k$ of $z^k$ is given by $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{\frac{f(z)g(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}}dz $$ Then you replace $g(z)$ inside the integral with its Laurent series in powers of $(z-z_0)$ : $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_n(z-z_0)^n dz } $$ Does uniform convergence allow us to interchange the integral and the sum? If so then it seems like each term is then a product $b_n a_{k-n}$ . EDIT: Here are more details, which I'm hoping are correct. $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}  \left( \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n }  \right) dz} $$ $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}  \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } dz} + \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } dz} $$ Both integrands converge uniformly on the circle $C$ since the series do and $\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}$ is analytic on $C$ (and so bounded). So we can interchange the integral and the limit of the sequence of partial sums to get $$c_k = \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k - n + 1}} } dz}        + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k - n +1 }}  } dz} $$ $$c_k = \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n a_{k-n}}        + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n a_{k-n}} $$ $$c_k = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{-\infty}{b_n a_{k-n}}$$ I feel like I must have made a mistake somewhere in the last 5 or so lines, because the (to me strange) conclusion I'm reaching is that if two Laurent series both converge on the same annulus then the sum $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{-\infty}{b_n a_{k-n}}$ converges for each $k$ .

A core part of the problem is to write a simple function that returns true if a number is a member of the Mandelbrot set and false otherwise.  Since JavaScript has no complex numbers in its built-in libraries, I simply represent a complex number as a two-element array with the first element being the real part and the second element being the imaginary part. I know that if any iteration of the function z^2 + c returns a value with absolute value greater than two, then z is definitely not a member of the Mandelbrot set.  If no iteration of z^2 + c returns a value greater than two, then z is a member of the Mandelbrot set, but it's impossible to iterate the function to infinity. Therefore, I tried iterating the function 1000 times and assuming that if it takes more than 1000 iterations, the function doesn't diverge to infinity.  This is a disaster.

On the unit circle $|z|=1$, since $\frac{\pi}{2} \leqslant \alpha<\pi$, one can find that \begin{split} |\psi(z)|=\left|\frac{2(n+1+e^{-i\theta})}{n+2}\right|>\left|\frac{2(n+1+e^{-i\theta})\cos\alpha}{n+2}\right|=|\phi(z)|. \end{split} Then by Rouche’s theorem , we know that $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)=\psi(z)+\phi(z)$ have the same number of zeros inside the unit circle $|z|=1$. Now my amazement is if some zeros of $\psi(z)$ lie on the unit cicle, can we show that some zeros of $P(z)$ lie on the unit cicle $|z|=1$, also? In other words, If all zeros of  $\psi(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$, can we prove that all zeros of $P(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$? For example: If we take $n=10, \cos\alpha=-\frac{5}{6},e^{-i\theta}=i$, then $\psi(z)=z^{11}+\frac{5}{6}z^{9}+\frac{i}{6}z$ and $P(z)=z^{11} - \frac{55}{36} z^{10} + \frac{5}{6} z^9 + \frac{i}{6}z - \frac{5i}{36}$ , and all zeros distribution of  $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)$ are illustrated by the following images. Zeros distribution of   $\psi(z)$ Zeros distribution of   $P(z)$ We can see that all zeros of $\psi(z)$ and $P(z)$ lie in the closed unit disk $|z|\leqslant 1$. But how to prove it?

Now recall the famous fact that curiously enough ONE of the solutions to that differential equation $y = e^{ix}$ happens to map the real-line to the unit circle This is is a pretty surprising result. But theres a family of such results The curves $re^{ix}$ and $re^{-ix}$ both map the real line to the circle of radius r. And in general the solution $ae^{ix} + be^{-ix}$ maps the real line to an ellipse given by $(x(t),y(t) = ((a+b)\cos(t), (a-b)\sin(t))$ (introducing complex numbers for $a,b$ allows us to tilt our ellipses around). So generally speaking the maps between ${x=0}$ to any ellipse centered at 0, are induced by the solutions of $y'' = -y$ . The Question: Given a polynomial differential equation $D$ , with integer-polynomial coefficients, how can one find the set of all [if any] pairs of algebraic varieties $U,V$ that get mapped to each other under solutions of $D$ viewed as complex functions.

If $f$ is not separable, then I want to say that there is a constant $b$ such that $f+b$ is separable, and then $f$ takes the value $-b$ at $>3$ distinct points. But I should make this rigorous...after all, separable polys may be dense, but how do we know that a set of inseparable polynomials is not parallel to the subspace spanned by the constant polynomials (so $f+b$ is inseparable for all $b\in \mathbb{C}$)?

96,Deriving the Poisson Integral Formula from the Cauchy Integral Formula,Deriving the Poisson Integral Formula from the Cauchy Integral Formula,,"If $f$ is analytic inside and on the unit circle $\gamma$, show that for $0<|z|<1$, $$2\pi if(z)=\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w-z}dw-\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w-1/\bar{z}}dw$$ and then derive the Poisson Integral Formula: $$f(re^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1-r^2}{1-2rcos(\theta-t)+r^2}f(e^{it})dt, \qquad 0<r<1.$$ I know the Cauchy Integral Formula is $f(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{w-a}dw$ for $a$ inside $\gamma$, and I also know its counterpart for derivatives, which is $f^{(n)}(a)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{f(w)}{(w-a)^{n+1}}dw$ for $a$ inside $\gamma$. The former looks promising in terms of deriving the first equation, if only I can find $a$ such that $\frac{f(w)}{w-a}=\frac{f(w)}{w-z}-\frac{f(w)}{w-1/\bar{z}}$. I think a key point is working out where $1/\bar{z}$ lies in relation to $z$ but I can't seem to visualise it, thanks to the function at $0$ being a singularity. Is the idea that the first fraction has a zero at $w=z$ and the second at $w=\frac{1}{\bar{z}}$? Putting the two fractions over a common denominator gives: $$\frac{f(w)(w-1/\bar{z})-f(w)(w-z)}{(w-z)(w-1/\bar{z})}=\frac{zf(w)-(f(w)/\bar{z})}{(w-z)(w-1/\bar{z})}=\frac{(z-1/\bar{z})}{w^2-w(z+1/\bar{z})+z/\bar{z}}f(w)$$ which does look a little like the final equation I am trying to find if I let $z=re^{i\theta}$. What am I missing? EDIT: Okay, letting the second fraction in the first equation become $\frac{\bar{z}f(w)}{w\bar{z}-1}$, I can get the second, however it is negative. I.e. I get $$f(re^{i\theta})=\frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi}\frac{r^2-1}{2rcos(\theta-t)+r^2+1}f(e^{it})dt$$ is this okay? I am still struggling with getting the first equation, however.
