0,Combinatorics question based on ProjectEuler 606,Combinatorics question based on ProjectEuler 606,,"Motivation The following text is from Problem 606 from Project Euler : A gozinta chain for $n$ is a sequence $\{1,a,b,...,n\}$ where each element properly divides the next.   For example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for $12$:   $$\{1,12\}, \{1,2,12\}, \{1,2,4,12\}, \{1,2,6,12\}, \{1,3,12\}, \{1,3,6,12\}, \{1,4,12\},\{1,6,12\}.$$   Let $S(n)$ be the sum of all numbers, $k$, not exceeding $n$, which have $252$ distinct gozinta chains.   You are given $S(10^6)=8462952$ and $S(10^{12})=623291998881978$.   Find $S(10^{36})$, giving the last nine digits of your answer. Given a number $n\in \mathbb N$ we can  write its prime factorization $n=p_1^{k_1}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{k_m}$. Every gozinta chain $(z_1=1,z_1,\ldots,z_{r-1},z_r=n)$ of length $r$ for $n$ can be built as $$\begin{align}   z_r=&             p_1^{k_1}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{k_m}\\  z_{r-1}= &  p_1^{k_1-t^{(r-1)}_{1}}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{k_m-t^{(r-1)}_{m}}\\ &\vdots\\ z_1     = &   p_1^{k_1-\sum_{j=1}^{r-1}t^{(j)}_1}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{k_m-\sum_{j=1}^{r-1}t^{(j)}_m}\\ z_0 =&p_1^{k_1-\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}t^{(j)}_1}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{k_m-\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}t^{(j)}_m}=1 \end{align}  $$ through the backward recursion $$z_{s-1}=\frac{z_s}{p_1^{t_1^{(s-1)}}\cdot\ldots\cdot p_m^{t^{(s-1)}_m}}$$ with the tuples $(t_1^{(0)},\ldots,t_m^{(0)}),\ldots,(t_1^{(r-1)},\ldots,t_m^{(r-1)})$ satisfying the two constraints $$ \begin{align} \sum_{j=0}^{r-1}t_\nu^{(j)}&=k_{\nu} && \forall \nu=1,\ldots, m\tag{1}\\  (t_1^{(j)},\ldots,t_m^{(j)})&\neq(0,\ldots,0) && \forall j=1,\ldots r\tag{2} \end{align}$$ The Problem I would like to understand more about the function $\alpha((k_1,\ldots,k_m))$ that associates the number of gozinta chains for $n$ to the multiplicities of $n$'s prime factors. Remark 1 : We could try to enumerate the tuples satisfying $(1),(2)$. For instance, if one supposes $m=1$, (i.e. $n=p^k$) the problem is equivalent to asking how many ordered partitions of $k$ exist. It is well known that such number is $2^{k-1}$. Then $\alpha(k)=2^{k-1}$ for $k>0$. The problem of enumerating tuples satisfying $(1),(2)$ could be seen as a generalization of integer partitioning to $m$-tuples. Remark 2 : The problem could be modelled combinatorially in the following way. Suppose we have $m$ bins with $k_1,\ldots, k_m$ balls. At each of our $r-1$ turns we must extract at least one ball. At the last turn ($r-1$) we must have removed all of the balls from the bins. In how many different ways can we do this without fixing the length of the game? Question Is there a known answer in the literature to the above mentioned combinatorics problem? I would expect either A reference following the idea of Remark 1, essentially correlating the result to ordered partitions of $m$-tuples. I am unaware of such results and have been able to find results only relative to ordered partitions of integers. A combinatorial approach following Remark 2.

It seems to me that it has a small mistake (or a maybe I have a misunderstanding) because not all the ones can actually be adjacent to each other. For example, if it happens that the last 1 and the first 1 are actually together then it could mean that we are selection first a book and then a pair (book, empty), but what would correspond to selecting two books that are adjacent. For me intuitively it would make more sense if we would have described the sequence they suggested by: 100110001001002 where the digit 2 corresponds to the special case indicating that its not a pair, (book, no book) but in fact it corresponds to the singleton selection (book). However, with that set up it makes it hard for me to count things cuz the 2 cannot be next 1's.... am i wrong or do the solutions have a small typo? Also, why is it not undercounting? This is why I believe it is undercounting: It seems to be undercounting (I think), cuz I could have choose a single book at the beginning and the reverse the pairs thereafter. i.e. (book),(no book, book), ..., (no book, book).

In Jukna's book, it is required that $p>2\max_i|a_i|$ where the $a_i$ are the elements of $A$ . In Tao & Vu it is required that $A\subset[-p/3,p/3]$ . Firstly, why do we need $p$ to be large at all?

He wants that players must align themselves in such a way that: “For each player $P$, the sum of numbers given to each player standing before $P$ in the line, including the number given to player $P$, should not be divisible by $3$”. In how many ways the players can align themselves according to the condition given by Michael Nobbs? The number of ways can be very large, so output the number of ways modulus $1000000007$ i.e. ($10^9 + 7)$. Small Case: $K=200$ Large Case: $K=10^8$ I have solved some other challenges, where by using mathematical framework I was able to get the right solution or to simplify the proposed problem to a much simpler one. I assume this is the same case since going through all permutations is very time expensive. Since now I was unable to find a property by which the statement $$3 \nmid \sum_{i=1}^{k} P_{perm_i}, k \in [1, 3K+1]$$ or the whole problem can be simplified. Can anybody help with a suggestion on how to successfuly solve the problem for small and large case?",,"['combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory', 'algorithms', 'summation', 'recreational-mathematics']"

The recurrence equations are helpful, but it's not quite what I was looking for. I don't think there is a simple equation that provides the answers. A recurrence equation is likely to catch all of the cases, but may not be efficient for computing by hand. I don't think there is an efficient way to do this, if k is large and n is small. Or is there? Update 2 Forgive me for bringing up the concept of a multiset. I thought it was in the standard literature. The size of a multiset $|(M, f)|$ is just the summation of the multiplicities $|(M, f)| = \sum_{i} f(x_i)$. It's not the same as the size of the support $|M|$.

The only solution I've come across, given the 5 measly hours I've researched the problem, was in Combinatorics and Graph Theory by Harris et. al, which mentions a crude method for counting the number of strings of length 4 of a given set of letters ""Alma, Alabama"". They enumerate 4 different patterns by hand, and use well known equations on those patterns. It works when n and k are small, but is inefficient otherwise. Update Sorry, I should have made my question a bit more explicit. I'm looking for an efficient method to do it by hand. The recurrence equations are helpful, but it's not quite what I was looking for. I don't think there is a simple equation that provides the answers. A recurrence equation is likely to catch all of the cases, but may not be efficient for computing by hand. I don't think there is an efficient way to do this, if k is large and n is small. Or is there? Update 2 Forgive me for bringing up the concept of a multiset. I thought it was in the standard literature. The size of a multiset $|(M, f)|$ is just the summation of the multiplicities $|(M, f)| = \sum_{i} f(x_i)$. It's not the same as the size of the support $|M|$. They are only equal when $f(x_i) = 1$ for all of the elements, just a regular set.",,"['combinatorics', 'multisets']"

95,"Efficient way to find all polygons of the same shape within a set, regardless of position, scale, or rotation","Efficient way to find all polygons of the same shape within a set, regardless of position, scale, or rotation",,"I've got a big set of 2D polygons described as a set of points. I would like to take this set of polygons and find any that are the same shape, regardless of rotation, translation, or scale. Each polygon has 3 or more points, and in some cases may have hundreds or thousands of points. There are hundreds of polygons in total. The polygons are optimised to remove runs of points that would form a straight line, e.g. the sequence $[(0,0), (10,10), (20,20)]$ would not be allowed. The polygons also aren't allowed to intersect themselves. The context for this problem is geometry instancing in 3D rendering, specifically rendering polygon regions and fills from PCB designs. Polygon regions are frequently repeated or copy-pasted around boards, so I would like to reduce the number of draw calls I need per frame by finding any polygon that I can instance using a transformation matrix. My first idea was to normalise the scale of all polygons, then compare the line lengths and angles between line vectors. Two polygons with the same shape should be composed from the same line lengths and same angles in the same order. I started implementing this, using the following procedure: Group all polygons by point count. Discard any groups that contain only one polygon, since they are guaranteed to be unique in shape. Center each polygon to $(0,0)$ and normalise its scale to a 1x1 bounding box. Calculate a ""hash"" for each polygon based on the sum of the magnitudes of all points, i.e. $\sum \sqrt{{x_i}^2 + {y_i}^2}$ , which for any two polygons sharing the same shape should be equal. Further group the polygons by this hash, and discard any groups that have only one member. This acts as a fast filtering step to quickly reject any polygons which are obviously not the same. Turn each polygon's point list into a circular list of angle-distance pairs, $(\theta,d)$ , where $\theta$ is the angle formed between the vectors meeting at the point, and $d$ is the length of the next clockwise vector. Within each group, compare all of the lists to each other to find matches. This works in theory, but I ran into two issues. First, ""clockwise"" isn't well-defined for arbitrary polygons that may have both concave and convex regions. This can be solved by traversing the lists in both directions during the final step, which has the added bonus of finding mirror-image copies of the same polygon, which could be described as a negative scale in one or both of the axes, and which I can handle just fine in the instancing code. Second, and more importantly, I couldn't come up with an efficient way to compare the two circular lists of points without knowing the correct starting offsets. It occurs to me that there might be some efficient mathematical way of identifying whether two circular sequences of number pairs contain the same ordered sequence of values regardless of whether the sequences are offset from each other. For example, $[1,2,3,5,2]$ and $[3,5,2,1,2]$ should be considered equal because they are the same set of numbers in the same order, just with a different starting offset (the latter is the former shifted two places left). However, $[1,2,3,5,2]$ and $[2,5,3,2,1]$ should not be considered equal, because the ordering is incorrect despite the same numbers appearing in the set. In practice the elements in each list would actually be a pair of numbers rather than a single number, but that's an implementation detail. Is there a clever way to solve this? If not, is there an alternative approach to the polygon shape comparison problem?","I've got a big set of 2D polygons described as a set of points.
