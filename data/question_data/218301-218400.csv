This is a fun (?) trivia item that fell out of a bit of geometry I was thinking about. One of the tangent half-angle formulas says $$ \tan\frac\alpha2 = \frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha}. $$ Consider the quadratic equation $$ x^2 + 2bx - 1 = 0. $$ Solving for $b$, we get $$ b = \frac{1-x^2}{2x}. $$ Let $\alpha=\arctan b$. Since $\tan\alpha=(1-x^2)/2x$, we have $\sin\alpha=(1-x^2)/(1+x^2)$ and $\cos\alpha=2x/(1-x^2)$, so $$ \tan\frac\alpha2=\frac{1-x^2}{(1+x)^2}. $$ Lo and behold, this fraction is not in lowest terms, and we have $$ \tan\frac\alpha2= \frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha} = \frac{1-x}{1+x}. $$ This implies $$ (1+x)\tan\frac\alpha2= 1-x $$ and so we seem to have reduced a second-degree equation to a first-degree equation by using the tangent half-angle formula. Solving for $x$, we get $$ x=\frac{1-\tan\frac\alpha2}{1+\tan\frac\alpha2}.\tag{1} $$ Since $\tan\alpha=b$, we have $\sin\alpha=b/\sqrt{1+b^2}$ and $\cos\alpha=1/\sqrt{1+b^2}$, so $$ \tan\frac\alpha2=\frac{\sin\alpha}{1+\cos\alpha}=\frac{b}{1+\sqrt{1+b^2}}. $$ Sustituting this back into $(1)$, we get $$ x = \frac{1+\sqrt{b^2-1}-b}{1+\sqrt{b^2+1}+b} = -b+\sqrt{b^2+1}. $$ This is one of the two solutions of the quadratic equation.

My answer: at first, we prove two inequalities: If $x\in (x,\pi)$ then $\sin x \leq x$ When $x\in(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, $\sin x \geq \frac{2x}{\pi}$ 1) first, let $y = \sin x -x $ $y^{\prime} = \cos x -1 \leq 0$ so $\sin x - x \leq \sin 0 -0 = 0$ which can be rewritten as $\sin x \leq x$ 2) Let $y=\sin x - \frac{2x}{\pi}$ thus $y^{\prime} = \cos x - \frac{2}{\pi}$ because $x\in (0, \frac{\pi}{2})$ so y at first decreases and then increases on the boundary of $x \in (0,\frac{\pi}{2})$ so $ \sin x - \frac{2}{\pi}\leq \max \{{\sin 0 - \frac{2}{\pi}0, \sin (\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{\pi}{2}) \}}$ so $\sin x \leq \frac{2x}{\pi}$ Then select $M\in N$ $\frac{\sin (mx)}{m} + \frac{\sin ((m+1)x)}{m+1} + \ldots + \frac{\sin ((m+n)x)}{m+n} \leq  \frac{\sin (mx)}{m} + \frac{\sin ((m+1)x)}{m} + \ldots + \frac{\sin ((m+n)x)}{m} $ => $\frac{1}{2M} \times \frac{\sin ((m-\frac{1}{2})x) - \sin ((n+\frac{1}{2})x)}{\sin \frac{x}{2}} < \frac{1}{m \times \sin \frac{x}{2}} \times \sin x + \frac{\sin 2x}{2} + \ldots + \frac{\sin ((m-1)x)}{m-1} < x + \frac{2x}{2} + \ldots + \frac{(m-1)x}{m-1} $ so just need to prove that $(m-1)x + \frac{1}{m \times \sin \frac{x}{2}} \leq 2\sqrt{\pi}$ select M which satisfies $ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{x} \leq m < \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{x} + 1 $ so $ (m-1)x < [ \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{x} \times x = \sqrt{\pi} ] $ thus $\frac {1}{m \times \sin(\frac{x}{2})}\leq[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\times \frac{2}{\frac{ \sin (0.5x)}{0.5x}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \times \frac{2}{\frac{\sin 0.5x}{0.5x}} ]$ because $x\in (0, \pi)$ thus $\frac{x}{2} \in (0, \frac{\pi}{2})$ $ (m-1)x + \frac{1}{m \times \sin(0.5x)} \leq 2\sqrt{\pi} $ thanks, for viewing and commenting. ps.
