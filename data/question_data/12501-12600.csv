For example, in $\cos^{-1}(\sqrt{\frac{1+x}{2}})$ , $-1\leq x\leq1$ , so it can be substituted with $\cos\theta$ or $\sin\theta$ ; substituting with $\sin\theta$ doesn't make our life easier, so we have to substitute with $\cos\theta$ . Similarly, in $\tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{1-x}{1+x}}\right)$ ( $-1<x\leq1$ ) and $\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1-x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}\right)$ $(x\in(\infty,-\infty))$ , $x$ has to be substituted with $\cos\theta$ & $\tan\theta$ respectively. All of the maths can also be done exclusively using the chain rule. However, the maths might get tedious in that way. Example Differentiate with respect to $x$ : $\tan^{-1}\frac{4x}{\sqrt{1-4x^2}}.$ Differentiation using trigonometric substitution: Let, $y=\tan^{-1}\frac{4x}{\sqrt{1-4x^2}}$ and $2x=\cos\theta\implies\theta=\cos^{-1}2x\ [\text{Assuming $\theta$ is within the principal range of $\arccos$}]$ Now, $$y=\tan^{-1}\frac{4x}{\sqrt{1-4x^2}}$$ $$y=\tan^{-1}\frac{2\cos\theta}{\sqrt{1-\cos^2\theta}}$$ $$y=\tan^{-1}2\cot\theta$$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{d}{d(2\cot\theta)}(\tan^{-1}2\cot\theta).\frac{d}{d(\cot\theta)}(2\cot\theta).\frac{d}{d\theta}(\cot\theta).\frac{d}{dx}\theta$$ $$...$$ $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{4}{(12x^2+1)(\sqrt{1-4x^2)}}$$ This is the correct answer.

But there is caveat: Only the total is known. And out of all the possible exponents that could be used: I want to find the smallest possible base with the smallest possible power. That is to say: If I was to take the digit of the base number $x$ and the digit of the exponent power $y$ , that both these numbers would be as small as possible without making the other larger. Essentially the resulting pair of numbers would essentially be the smallest difference of values and/ or the smallest sum total. Moreover I need to “ prove ” that it is the smallest combination of numbers possible. Unfortunately it can’t be “close enough.” It needs to be certain that this pair of numbers are the smallest pair possible values that can form the exponent total. Here is an example that I hope illustrates what I am trying to achieve: (But remember, I’m not just trying to find the answer. Rather I want to know if there is a mathematical process to finding the smallest possible pair in the first place?) Let’s say that the equation is $x^{y} = 64$ . The most simple exponent is $64^{1}$ . But it is also the largest number I could use as a base and so would not be considered a “successful” answer, (even if the exponent is only $1$ ). $2^{6}$ would be considered more “successful” exponent. As the numbers are $2$ and $6$ . It doesn’t matter if the base is smaller than the exponent. The only criteria is that they are made of the smallest numbers as viewed as a decimal value. $4^{3}$ I believe to be the most successful. The base may have significantly increased but we have reduced the exponent by half its value. $8^{2}$ would be less of a successas it has still gained a higher number. Whilst it is the smallest exponent possible aside from $1$ , the base has risen to $8$ . Now, the first question would be how do I find $4^{3}$ out of all the exponents I could possibly use? Then secondly how can I be certain that there is no smaller combination of numbers that could be used to create an exponent that results in $64$ ?.

In the final step we put the value of $h=0$ say in that it is an infinitesimal quantity.

68,Express $f_n(x)=\cos{(n\arccos{x})}$ as a polynomial.,Express  as a polynomial.,f_n(x)=\cos{(n\arccos{x})},"I had an interesting problem on an exam a few days ago in elementary calculus. It reads: Show that for $n\geq 2,$ the function $f_n(x)=\cos{(n\arccos{x})}, \ x\in[-1,1]$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ and determine the coefficient for $x^n$. I was not able to work this problem and after the exam I looked this up online and it seems as if this is related to the Chebyshev polynomials. But we have never covered these kinds of polynomials in this course. Is there other ways to do this? What I tried to do in the exam was to compute $f_n(x)$ for $n=1,2...$ and see if I can find a pattern and formulate an induction hypothesis and then prove it. I got that $$f_1(x)=\cos{(1\cdot \arccos{x})}=x,\\f_2(x)=\cos{(2\cdot \arccos{x})}=1-2\cos^2{(\arccos{x})}=1-2x^2\\ f_3(x)=\cos{(3\cdot \arccos{x})}=4\cos^3{(\arccos{x})}-3\cos{(\arccos{x})}=4x^3-3x$$ As you can see it quickly becomes ugly and there is no pattern to be seen. So, to formulate a hypothesis for even numbers $n=2k$ was not hard, but for odd numbers, $n=2k+1$ i could not do it. Is this start a good one or is this totally wrong? Would this method work If I was a bit better at math? any other tips/tricks that only uses elementary calculus?

Now Now if , then by applying integration by parts, we get the reccurence relation and we can solve it then, but the thing is, we neet to find ,so even if we compute , it wouldn't be defined at and so would , then how do I find by other method? I also tried the substitution , which yields and when I saw their graphs, it clearly doesn't seem that the area under the graph of this function from to and from to are equal. I would appreciate if someone could  continue from my method and other solutions are also welcomed...",\displaystyle I=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x-1}{(x+1)(\ln x)} \mathrm{d}x  \displaystyle I(a)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(x-1)x^a}{(x+1)(\ln x)} \mathrm{d}x \displaystyle I'(a)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(x-1)x^a}{x+1} \mathrm{d}x \displaystyle I'(a)=\int_{0}^{1}x^a \mathrm{d}x-\int_{0}^{1}\frac{2x^a}{x+1} \mathrm{d}x \displaystyle J(a)=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x^a}{x+1}\mathrm{d}x J(a)+J(a-1)=\dfrac{1}{a} I(0) J(a) 0 I(a) I'(a) x \to \frac{1}{x} \displaystyle I=\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{(x-1)}{(x+1)(\ln x)} \mathrm{d}x 0 1 1 \infty,"['calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals']"
98,Calculate $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{nf^{(n)}}(x)$ where $xf(x)=e^x-1$,Calculate  where,\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{nf^{(n)}}(x) xf(x)=e^x-1,Given that $xf(x)=e^x-1$ calculate $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{nf^{(n)}}(x)$. I have try to figure the $n$th derivative of the function but it looks messy.

99,$u$-substitution always evaluates to $0$,-substitution always evaluates to,u 0,"Consider the integral $$ \int_a^b f(x) \,dx $$ now make the $u$-substitution $u \mapsto c + (x-a)(x-b)$. The resulting integral is $$ \int_c^c h(u) \,du $$ where $h(u)$ is the integrand $f$ after the substitution, however, regardless of $f$ the integral $\int_c^c du = 0$. Looking at the definition Wikipedia provides I believe the substitution meets every condition. It's differentiable and has a integrable derivative, because it's a polynomial. So what's wrong with this substitution such that it always results in $0$?","Consider the integral $$ \int_a^b f(x) \,dx $$ now make the $u$-substitution $u \mapsto c + (x-a)(x-b)$.
