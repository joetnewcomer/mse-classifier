8,Solution space to a functional equation,Solution space to a functional equation,,"This question comes from my attempts at understanding an example presented by Bill Gasarch on his blog . The example is of a continuous strictly increasing function whose derivative is zero almost everywhere. The example is apparently discussed in the book Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley, but I currently do not have access to it. Gasarch explains the background very well. Given a parameter $p \in (0,1)$, he describes a continuous function $F:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ which is increasing, $F(0) = 0$, $F(1) = 1$, but such that $F' = 0$ a.e.

More generally, suppose we have a family of subsets, $A_i\subseteq X_i$, and we know that $A_j\in\mathbb{S}_j$ for all $j\neq i_0$ and that $\prod_{i\in I}A_i\in\mathbb{S}$. Does it follow that $A_{i_0}\in \mathbb{S}_{i_0}$? Basically, I would like to reconstruct each $\mathbb{S}_i$ from $\prod_{i \in I} \mathbb{S}_i$. If you have other approaches, please don't hesitate to reply. In particular, Part 1 and Part 2 are attempts based on projection of measurable rectangles in the product $\sigma$-algebra.

I will first start with the definition of Definition (outer measure) Let $X$ be a set. An outer measure is a function $\mu^*$ defined on the collection of all subsets of $X$ such that (i) $\mu^*(\emptyset)=0$ (ii) if $A \subseteq B \Rightarrow \mu^*(A)\leq \mu^*(B)$ (iii) $\mu^*(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i)\leq \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \mu^*(A_i)$ , where $A_i$ are arbitrary subsets of $X$ . Proposition Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that (1) $\emptyset \in \mathcal{C}$ (2) there exist $D_1,D_2,... \in \mathcal{C}$ such that $X=\cup_{i=1}^{\infty}D_i$ . Further, suppose $l:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ with $l(\emptyset)=0$ . Define $\mu^*(E):=\inf\{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} l(A_i): A_i \in \mathcal{C} \text{ for all i   and } E\subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\} $ Then $\mu^*$ is an outer measure. Proof: (i) holds by definition of $l$ . (ii) holds as a property of the infimum, i.e. if $A \subset B \Rightarrow infA \leq infB$ Now we came to (iii): To get a better feeling of what is going on, I wanted to first show a weaker condition than (iii). I want to show that, for $A,B \subseteq X$ we get: $\mu^*(A \cup B)\leq \mu^*(A) +\mu^*(B)$ . For this prove I will use the \epsilon-definiton of the infimum, i.e. I is the infimum of some set M, iff I is a lower bound of M $\forall \epsilon>0 \exists m \in M: I+\epsilon>m$ So, lets start: Since $A \subseteq X$ we can find a cover $A_i$ such that $A\subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i$ . By the same argument, $B\subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i$ . Since $\mu^*(A)$ is the infimum of the set of sums of the form $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i $ , we can find a $\epsilon/2$ such that $\mu^*(A)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}> \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i$ The same applies to $\mu^*(B)$ and we get: $\mu^*(B)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}> \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}B_i$ Now since $A\subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i, B\subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i$ we know that $A \cup B \subseteq \bigl(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \bigr) \bigcup \bigl(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} B_i \bigr)$ . Thus we can find a covering $\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} (A_i \cup B_i)$ of $A \cup B$ . Now the idea would be to write $\mu^*(A \cup B)\leq \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}l(A_i \cup B_i)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} l(A_i)+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} l(B_i)\leq \mu^*(A )+ \frac{\epsilon}{2}+\mu^*(B)+ \frac{\epsilon}{2}=\mu^*(A )+ \mu^*(B)+ \epsilon$ And since this wolds for all $\epsilon$ we get the result.

How can I justify the passage from the integral above to $$ Z_t = \int_{[0,t]}\int_{0}^{\infty}1_{z\leq\lambda(s)} M(ds,dz) $$ ? This makes me doubt about my comprehension of this $Z_t$ .

This concerns me all the more as the following expression is often used $$ \int_{(0,s)}h(s-u)dZ_u = \sum_{ k : T_k < s} h(s-T_k) $$ Which, for me until now, does not make sense given the definition of $T_n$ .

Queries regarding convex functions.,,"Let $(Ω, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space and let $\mathcal{G} ⊂ \mathcal{F}$ be a sub- $σ$ -algebra. Conditional Jensen's inequality: Let $φ : R → R$ be a convex function, $X$ and $φ(X)$ be integrable random variables. Prove the conditional Jensen inequality $φ(E[X|\mathcal{G}]) ≤ E[φ(X)|\mathcal{G}].$ Hint: Convexity of $φ$ implies that for $x$ , $y$ ∈ $R$ , there exists a measurable function $c : R → R$ such that $φ(x) ≥ φ(y) + c(y)(x − y).$ I have made an attempt on the this question but I am sure that it is not fully correct. My attempt: Attempt 1: Taking conditional expectation both sides and using monotonocity, we get: $E[φ(x)|\mathcal{G}] ≥ E[φ(y)|\mathcal{G}] + E[c(y)(x − y)|\mathcal{G}]$ , where $x,y$ are integrable random variables. Now, put $X$ instead of $x$ and $E[X|\mathcal{G}]$ instead of $y$ . Then, $E[φ(X)|\mathcal{G}] ≥ E[φ(E[X|\mathcal{G}])|\mathcal{G}] + E[c(E[X|\mathcal{G}])(X − E[X|\mathcal{G}])|\mathcal{G}]$ .

Also, $c(E[X|\mathcal{G}])$ is a $\mathcal{G}$ -measurable function by the definition of the function $c$ and the fact that $E[X|\mathcal{G}]$ is $\mathcal{G}$ measurable. So, $E[c(E[X|\mathcal{G}])(X − E[X|\mathcal{G}])|\mathcal{G}]=c(E[X|\mathcal{G}])E[0]$ = $0$ . Hence, we get that: $E[φ(X)|\mathcal{G}] \geq φ(E[X|\mathcal{G}])$ . Is this solution alright?

Then, $|A\cup G|\ge |A|+|G|$ . Proof : WLOG, suppose that 1) $a_k<b_k$ and that $a_1<a_2<...<a_n$ . 2) $a_i,b_i\not\in A$ . For 2), indeed if $X\subset \{a_1,b_1,\cdots, a_n,b_n\}, X\subset A$ , then $|A\cup G|=|(A-X)\cup G|, $ because $X$ is a finite set. Therefore, we could consider $A-X$ instead of $A$ . So the assumption 2) is valid. Take any sequence of open intervals $\{I_n\}$ that cover $A\cup G$ ,i.e., $A\cup G\subset \cup_n I_n$ . Define $K_n, L_n, J_n, M_n$ as follows: $J_n=(-\infty, a_1)\bigcap I_n; K_n= G\bigcap I_n, L_n= (\bigcup_{k=1}^{n-1}(b_k,a_{k+1}))\cap I_n, M_n=(b_n, \infty)\bigcap I_n$ . Clearly, $J_1,L_1,M_1, J_2, L_2, M_2,\cdots$ cover $A$ and $\{K_n\}$ covers $G$ . Since, $l(I_n)= (l(J_n)+l(L_n)+l(M_n))+l(K_n)$ , we have $$\sum l(I_n)= \sum(l(J_n)+l(L_n)+l(M_n))+\sum l(K_n)\ge|A|+|G|$$ Taking infimum over all such open intervals $\{I_j\}$ , we get $|A\bigcup G|\ge |A|+|G|.$ This proves the claim. By subadditivity, we even have $|A\bigcup G|= |A|+|G|$ . Now coming back to the statement in title, it is known that every open set in $R$ is a countable disjoint union of open intervals so there exist $\{I_n\}$ such that $G=\bigcup_n I_n$ . By subadditivity, we have $|A\cup G|\ge |A\bigcup (\cup_{n=1}^k I_n)$ for every $k\in \mathbb N$ . By the claim proven above, $|A\cup G|\ge |A|+\sum_{n=1}^kl(I_n)$ for every $k\in \mathbb N$ . Letting $k\to \infty$ , $|A\cup G|\ge |A|+\sum_{n=1}^\infty l(I_n)\ge|A|+|G|.$ By subadditivity, $|A\cup G|\le |A|+|G|$ so we get the equality. $$\tag*{$\square$}$$ My question: In theorem 2.62 of Axler's measure theory book, Axler first proves the above theorem in case $G= (a,b)$ and then concludes using induction on $m$ , the no. of open intervals (disjoint) whose union equals to $G$ .

72,$L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is separable,is separable,L^2(\mathbb{R}),"I would like to prove that $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is separable. Using the hint provided in Reed & Simon's book, I was able to show that: the set of simple functions on $[a,b]$ is dense in $L^2([a,b])$ the set of step functions on $[a,b]$ is dense in the set of simple functions on $[a,b]$ . Next, I would like to show that $C([a,b])$ is dense in the set of step functions on $[a,b]$ , so that I can conclude that $C([a,b])$ is dense in $L^2([a,b])$ . Then, using this fact, I would like to show that $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is separable. This is where I am having some trouble. To prove the denseness of $C([a,b])$ in the set of step functions on $[a,b]$ , note that by definition a step function is defined on a disjoint union of open intervals. Consider two consecutive open intervals, $(a_l, a_r)$ and $(b_l, b_r)$ . We can construct a continuous function that agrees with the simple function on $(a_l, a_r-\epsilon/2) \cup(b_l+\epsilon/2, b_r)$ , and construct a linear function connecting the points at $a_r-\epsilon/2$ and $b_l+\epsilon/2$ . Since the support of this line can be made arbitrarily small we will obtain the result. Based on the above, to prove that $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is separable it will suffice to prove that $C([a,b])$ has a countable dense subset. One approach I thought of was to use polynomials with rational coefficients. However, this would invoke the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, which does not appear until later in the book so I'm trying to avoid it. I will also have to extend the domain of $C([a,b])$ to $C(\mathbb{R})$ , but I think this can be achieved by taking the countable union $$\bigcup_{n=-\infty}^\infty [n, n+1].$$ Assuming my ideas are correct, I am have some trouble making these arguments rigorous. EDIT: Upon thinking about it further and taking a look at a few other books, I came up with the following. Let $f$ be a step function on $[a,b]$ and $\epsilon > 0$ . By Lusin's theorem there exists a continuous function $g$ that agrees with $f$ except on a set of measure $\epsilon$ . Then $$\|f - g\|_{L_2} = \int_{[a,b]}|f-g|^2d\mu = \int_{\{x \in [a,b]: f(x) \neq g(x)\}} |f-g|^2 d\mu \\\leq \epsilon \sup_{x \in [a,b]} |f|^2 \rightarrow 0$$ I am unsure of the above since Lusin's theorem only holds for functions with compact support, but what if our step function do not have compact support? This might be a problem when extending our domain from $[a,b]$ to all of $\mathbb{R}$ . Also the above doesn't use anything about step functions, so couldn't it have been applied to any $f \in L^2([a,b])$ ? However, if this is correct than I have shown that $C([a,b])$ is dense in $L^2([a,b])$ . By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, the polynomials are also dense in $L^2([a,b])$ . Countability follows by considering polynomials with rational coefficients (since $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ ). Hence $L^2([a,b])$ is separable. The only thing remaining is to extent this result to $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . Notice that since $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} (\cdots) d\mu = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int_{[-n,n]} (\cdots) d\mu $$ all our previous results hold for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ and so we are done.

Problem statement (adapted from original to make it self-contained; from R.G.

Let $\varphi$ be continuous on $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R$ and satisfy the condition: $(*)$ there exists $K > 0$ such that $|\varphi(t)| \leq K |t|$ for $|t| \geq K$ . If $(f_n)$ converges to f in $L_p$ then $(\varphi \circ f_n)$ converges in $L_p$ to $\varphi \circ f$ . Conversely, if condition $(*)$ is not satisfied, there exists a finite measure space and a sequence $(f_n)$ which converges in $L_p$ to $f$ but such that $(\varphi \circ f_n)$ does not converge in $L_p$ to $\varphi \circ f$ .

I produced a proof but I think it is wrong since I didn't use the fact that $A$ is measurable, only that its outer measure is positive. Here it is. Let $Q_j$ be the collection of closed unit cubes with integer base points, i.e. of the form $[a_1,a_1+1]\times\dots\times[a_n,a_n+1]$ for $a_i$ integers. Then $A = \bigcup (A\cap Q_j)$ . Now suppose that $m_*(A\cap Q_j)=0$ for all $j$ . Then, by subadditivity of the outer measure, $m_*(A) = 0$ . In our case, since $m_*(A) > 0$ , there must exists a unit cube $K$ such that $m_*(A\cap K) > 0$ . By translating the set $A$ , we can assume wlog that $K$ is the unit cube at the origin $[0,1]^n$ . Now it's just an adaptation of the Vitali set argument. Consider the classes of $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Q}^n$ that intersect $A\cap K$ .

Now let $\{r_k\}$ be an enumeration of the rationals in $[-1,1]^n$ and let $V_k = V + r_k$ . For each $k$ , we have $V_k \subseteq K+r_k$ , so $V_k\subseteq [-1,2]^n$ . We also have that $A\cap K \subseteq \bigcup V_k$ because if $x\in A\cap K$ , then there exists a $x_\alpha\in V$ such that $x\sim x_\alpha$ and therefore $x\in V_k$ for some $k$ . Putting these inclusions together and using monotonicity of the outer measure, $0 < m_*(\bigcup V_k)\leq 3^n$ where the strict inequality is because $m_*(A\cap K)>0$ . If we assume that $V$ is measurable, we have that $0 < \sum m_*(V) \leq 3^n$ , which is impossible. Since $V$ is contained in $A\cap K$ , we have produced a non-measurable set contained in $A$ .

My question: In the proof of direction $\implies$ in Theorem 1.4, i.e., $f \in E^{X}$ is $\mu$ -measurable implies $f$ is $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable, the author uses the completeness of the measure space as follows ""...Furthermore, the completeness of $\mu$ shows that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N$ is a $\mu$ -null set..."" Could you explain how 1.5(i) implies 1.5(ii) in the case of non-complete measure space? I attach all related definitions and the proof of Theorem 1.4 below for reference and clarity. Let $(X, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ be a complete, $\sigma$ -finite measure space; $(E,|\cdot|)$ a Banach space. Suppose $\mathrm{E}$ is a property that is either true or false of each point in $X$ . We say that $\mathrm{E}$ holds ${\mu}$ -almost everywhere , or for ${\mu}$ -almost every $x \in X$ , if there exists a $\mu$ -null set $N \in \mathcal A$ such that $\mathrm{E}(x)$ is true for every $x \in N^{c}$ . ""Almost every"" and ""almost everywhere"" are both abbreviated ""a.e."". We say $f \in E^{X}$ is ${\mu}$ -simple if $f(X)$ is finite, $f^{-1}(e) \in \mathcal{A}$ for every $e \in E$ , and $\mu\left(f^{-1}(E \backslash\{0\})\right)<\infty$ . We denote by $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ the set of all $\mu$ -simple functions from $X$ to $E$ . A function $f \in E^{X}$ is said to be ${\mu}$ -measurable if there is a sequence $\left(f_{j}\right)$ in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ such that $f_{j} \rightarrow f \mu$ -almost everywhere as $j \rightarrow \infty$ . We set $$ \mathcal{L}_{0}(X, \mu, E):=\left\{f \in E^{X} ; f \text { is } \mu \text {-measurable }\right\} . $$ A function $f \in E^{X}$ is said to be $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable if the inverse images of open sets of $E$ under $f$ are measurable, that is, if $f^{-1}\left(\mathcal{T}_{E}\right) \subset \mathcal{A}$ , where $\mathcal{T}_{E}$ is the norm topology on $E$ . If there is a $\mu$ -null set $N \in \mathcal A$ such that $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ is separable, we say $f$ is ${\mu}$ -almost separable valued . Proof of Theorem 1.4. "" $\implies$ "" Suppose $f \in \mathcal{L}_{0}(X, \mu, E)$ . (i) There exist a $\mu$ -null set $N$ and a sequence $\left(\varphi_{j}\right)$ in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ such that $$ \varphi_{j}(x) \rightarrow f(x) \quad(j \rightarrow \infty) \quad \text { for } x \in N^{c} . \quad \quad (1.1) $$ By Proposition I.6.8, $F:=\bigcup_{j=0}^{\infty} \varphi_{j}(X)$ is countable and therefore the closure $\bar{F}$ is separable. Because of $(1.1)$ we have $f\left(N^{c}\right) \subset \bar{F}$ . Remark 1.3(b) now shows that $f$ is $\mu$ -almost separable valued. (ii) Let $O$ be open in $E$ and define $O_{n}:=\left\{y \in O\right.$ ; $\left.\operatorname{dist}\left(y, O^{c}\right)>1 / n\right\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ . Then $O_{n}$ is open and $\bar{O}_{n} \subset O$ . Also let $x \in N^{c}$ . By (1.1), $f(x)$ belongs to $O$ if and only if there exist $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $m=m(n) \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ such that $\varphi_{j}(x) \in O_{n}$ for $j \geq m$ . Therefore $$ f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c}=\bigcup_{m, n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}} \bigcap_{j \geq m} \varphi_{j}^{-1}\left(O_{n}\right) \cap N^{c} . \quad \quad (1.2) $$ But $\varphi_{j}^{-1}\left(O_{n}\right) \in \mathcal{A}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $j \in \mathbb{N}$ , because $\varphi_{j}$ is $\mu$ -simple. Hence (1.2) says that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c} \in \mathcal{A}$ . Furthermore, the completeness of $\mu$ shows that $f^{-1}(O) \cap N$ is a $\mu$ -null set, and altogether we obtain $$ f^{-1}(O)=\left(f^{-1}(O) \cap N\right) \cup\left(f^{-1}(O) \cap N^{c}\right) \in \mathcal{A} . $$ "" $\impliedby$ "" Suppose $f$ is $\mu$ -almost separable valued and $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable. (iii) We consider first the case $\mu(X)<\infty$ . Take $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . By assumption, there is a $\mu$ -null set $N$ such that $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ is separable. If $\left\{e_{j} ; j \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ is a countable dense subset of $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ , the collection $\left\{\mathbb{B}\left(e_{j}, 1 /(n+1)\right) ; j \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ covers the set $f\left(N^{c}\right)$ , and thus $$ X=N \cup \bigcup_{j \in \mathbb{N}} f^{-1}\left(\mathbb{B}\left(e_{j}, 1 /(n+1)\right)\right) . $$ Since $f$ is $\mathcal{A}$ -measurable, $X_{j, n}:=f^{-1}\left(\mathbb{B}\left(e_{j}, 1 /(n+1)\right)\right)$ belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ for every $(j, n) \in \mathbb{N}^{2}$ . The continuity of $\mu$ from below and the assumption $\mu(X)<\infty$ then imply that there are $m_{n} \in \mathbb{N}^{\times}$ and $Y_{n} \in \mathcal{A}$ such that $$ \bigcup_{j=0}^{m_{n}} X_{j, n}=Y_{n}^{c} \quad \text { and } \quad \mu\left(Y_{n}\right)<\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} . $$ Now define $\varphi_{n} \in E^{X}$ through $$ \varphi_{n}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} e_{0} & \text { if } x \in X_{0, n}, \\ e_{j} & \text { if } x \in X_{j, n} \backslash \bigcup_{k=0}^{j-1} X_{k, n} \text { for } 1 \leq j \leq m_{n}, \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }. \end{array}\right. $$ Obviously $\varphi_{n} \in \mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , and $$ \left|\varphi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|<1 /(n+1) \text { for } x \in Y_{n}^{c} . $$ The decreasing sequence $Z_{n}:=\bigcup_{k=0}^{\infty} Y_{n+k}$ satisfies $$ \mu\left(Z_{n}\right) \leq \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mu\left(Y_{n+k}\right) \leq \frac{1}{2^{n}} \quad \text { for } n \in \mathbb{N}. $$ It therefore follows from the continuity of $\mu$ from above that $Z:=\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} Z_{n}$ is $\mu$ -null. We now set $$ \psi_{n}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} \varphi_{n}(x) & \text { if } x \in Z_{n}^{c}, \\ 0 & \text { if } x \in Z_{n}. \end{array}\right. $$ Then $\left(\psi_{n}\right)$ is a sequence in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ . Also there is for every $x \in Z^{c}=\bigcup_{n} Z_{n}^{c}$ an $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x \in Z_{m}^{c}$ . Since $Z_{m}^{c} \subset Z_{n}^{c}$ for $n \geq m$ , it follows that $$ \left|\psi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|=\left|\varphi_{n}(x)-f(x)\right|<1 /(n+1) . $$ Altogether, $\lim \psi_{n}(x)=f(x)$ for every $x \in Z^{c}$ . Therefore $f$ is $\mu$ -measurable. (iv) Finally, we consider the case $\mu(X)=\infty$ . Remark IX.2.4(c) shows there is a disjoint sequence $\left(X_{j}\right)$ in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\bigcup_{j} X_{j}=X$ and $\mu\left(X_{j}\right)<\infty$ . By part (iii), there exist for each $j \in \mathbb{N}$ a sequence $\left(\varphi_{j, k}\right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ and a $\mu$ -null set $N_{j}$ such that $\lim _{k} \varphi_{j, k}(x)=f(x)$ for every $x \in X_{j} \cap N_{j}^{c}$ . With $N:=\bigcup_{j} N_{j}$ and $$ \varphi_{k}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} \varphi_{j, k}(x) & \text { if } x \in X_{j}, \quad j \in\{0, \ldots, k\}, \\ 0 & \text { if } x \notin \bigcup_{j=0}^{k} X_{j} \end{array}\right. $$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , we have $\varphi_{k} \in \mathcal{S}(X, \mu, E)$ and $\lim _{k} \varphi_{k}(x)=f(x)$ for $x \in N^{c}$ .

Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space such that $(i)$ the space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is separable, that is exists a countable collection $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ ; $(ii)$ $\mu$ is a sigma-finite measure. Then for each $p\in [1,+\infty)$ the space $L^p(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ is separable, that is it has a dense subset. The proof makes use of the following important Lemma Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a finite measure space. Let $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ a collection such that $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ ; let $\mathcal{A}_0:=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ the algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$ . Then for all $F\in\mathcal{A}$ and for all $\varepsilon >0$ exists $G\in\mathcal{A}_0$ such that $$\mu(F\setminus G)+\mu(G\setminus F)<\varepsilon$$ Notation $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})$ is the sigma- algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$ . We divide the proof of Theorem $1$ into steps: Step 1. Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space. Then for each $p\in [1,+\infty)$ the set of measurable simple functions with rational coefficient $$\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q}}:=\{s\in \mathcal{S}(X,\mathcal{A})\;|\; s(X)\subseteq\mathbb{Q}\}$$ is dense in $L^p(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ Notation $\mathcal{S}(X,\mathcal{A})$ denote the collection of measurable simple function. Step 2. For all $f\in L^p$ e for all $\varepsilon > 0$ exists $t\in\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that $$\boxed{\mu(\{t\ne 0\})<\infty,\quad ||f-t||_p<\varepsilon}$$ This step is proved using the step 1 and the fact that $\mu$ is sigma-finite. Step 3. We suppose that $\mu(X)<\infty$ . As the space $(X,\mathcal{A})$ is separable, exists a countable family $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$ such that $\sigma_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}$ . The algebra $\mathcal{A}_0:=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ generated by $\mathcal{C}$ is countable and also the set $$\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}:=\bigg\{\sum_{k=1}^n c_k\chi_{G_k}\;|\; G_k\in\mathcal{A}_0, c_k\in\mathbb{Q}, n\in \mathbb{N}\bigg\}.$$ It is simple to prove with the help of the Lemma that $\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}$ is dense in $\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ . Step 4. Therefore, let $f\in L^p$ and we fix $\varepsilon >0;$ then for the step 2. exists $t\in\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that $$\mu(\{t\ne 0\})<\infty\quad ||f-t||_p<\varepsilon/2$$ then for what has just been said exists $s\in\mathcal{S}_{\mathbb{Q},\mathcal{A}_0}$ such that $$||t-s||_p<\varepsilon/2$$ therefore results: $$||f-s||_p\le ||f-t||_p+||t-s||_p<\varepsilon/2+\varepsilon/2,$$ where we used the step 2., since the space is finite. Question. Why can we deduce from step 2 that it is not restrictive to assume that $\mu(X)<\infty$ ?

95,Proof that the set of discontinuous points of a Riemann integrable function has measure zero,Proof that the set of discontinuous points of a Riemann integrable function has measure zero,,"This comes from proving Lebesgue's Theorem for Riemann integrability as specified in Abbott's Understanding Analysis , Theorem 7.6.5. The theorem is as follows: Let $f$ be a bounded function defined on the interval $[a, b]$ . Then, $f$ is Riemann-integrable if and only if the set of points where $f$ is not continuous has measure zero. I've followed along with the exercises and have been able to prove the <= direction. I've been stuck on one core point in the proof of the => direction. The specific area I am struggling with is as follows. The proof starts: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary, and fix $\alpha > 0$ . Because $f$ is Riemann-integrable, there exists a partition $P_\epsilon$ of $[a, b]$ such that $U(f, P_\epsilon) - L(f, P_\epsilon) < \alpha \epsilon$ . Prove that $D^\alpha$ has measure zero. Where $D^\alpha = \{ x \in [a, b] : f \textrm{ is not }\alpha\textrm{-continuous at }x\}$ . Edit: Including definition of $\alpha$ -continuous: Let $f$ be defined on $[a, b]$ , and let $\alpha > 0$ . The function $f$ is $\alpha$ -continuous at $x\in[a, b]$ if there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $y, z \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)$ it follows that $| f(y) - f(z) | < \alpha$ . If $f$ is uniformly $\alpha$ -continuous on $[a, b]$ , there is a single $\delta > 0$ such that $| x- y | < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(y)| < \alpha$ . It follows that if $f$ is $\alpha$ continuous at every point on a compact set $K$ , then $f$ is uniformly $\alpha$ continuous on $K$ . My attempt so far has taken me down the path of writing: $$U(f, P_\epsilon) - L(f, P_\epsilon) < \alpha \epsilon$$ $$\sum_k (M_k - m_k)\Delta x_k < \alpha \epsilon$$ Where $M_k$ and $m_k$ are the supremum and infimum, respectively, of $f$ on the interval $[x_{k-1}, x_k]$ . Then I attempt to split the intervals into those that contain points in $D^\alpha$ and those that do not. Since the intervals are compact, those intervals containing no points in $D^\alpha$ are uniformly $\alpha$ continuous, which bounds $M_k - m_k < \alpha$ on those intervals (this only holds within some $\delta$ , but we can refine the intervals to have smaller length than $\delta$ and I believe this point works out fine). From here I'm at a bit of a loss, I can't figure out how to take this argument further. I feel that I'm likely missing something relative obvious, so I'd appreciate any nudging in the right direction.","This comes from proving Lebesgue's Theorem for Riemann integrability as specified in Abbott's Understanding Analysis , Theorem 7.6.5.

Let $(X,\mathcal{M}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f \in L^1(\mu)$ . Prove that, for all $\epsilon >0$ , there exist a simple measurable function $s$ such that $$\int_X |f-s| d\mu < \epsilon.$$ The simple function $s$ can assume negative value as well.

Then $s_n^+ \rightarrow f^+$ , and $s_n^+$ is non decreasing simple function.
