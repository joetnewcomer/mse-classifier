0,Finding the hyperbolic length in a hyperbolic right triangle,Finding the hyperbolic length in a hyperbolic right triangle,,"Question: In a hyperbolic right angled triangle, the two legs have hyperbolic lengths of $3$ and $4$ . What is the hyperbolic length of the hypotenuse? Is this larger or smaller than $5$ ? I'm having trouble with this problem mainly because I am not allowed to use a calculator. So I have to do everything manually. I used the formula: $$\cosh(c)=\cosh(a)\cosh(b) $$ where $a=3$ and $b=4$ I know $\cosh(x)=\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$ With that being said, by plugging the values of $a$ and $b$ $$\cosh(c)=\cosh(3)\cosh(4) $$ and substituting into $\cosh(x)$ $$\cosh(c)=\frac{e^3+e^{-3}}{2} \times \frac{e^4+e^{-4}}{2}$$ I know: $$\cosh^{-1}(x)=\ln(x+\sqrt{x^2-1})$$ In this case, my $x$ would be $\frac{e^3+e^{-3}}{2} \times \frac{e^4+e^{-4}}{2}$ Plugging into the inverse, I would obtain: $$c=\cosh^{-1}(x)=\ln\left(\frac{e^3+e^{-3}}{2} \times \frac{e^4+e^{-4}}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{e^3+e^{-3}}{2} \times \frac{e^4+e^{-4}}{2}\right)^2-1}\right)$$ Maybe my algebra is a bit rusty but how would I know if $c$ is less than or greater than $5$ . The only way I could think is to simplify above but I'm not sure how to simplify above. It became way too messy. Any help?

I'm looking for a satisfying proof that I can present to young people, so: no complex numbers, and no power series, and, more generally no ""magic""! In fact, the closer the proof is to being ""just plain algebra"", the better. Motivation. There's a geometric way of defining the circular functions: first, position yourself at $(1,0)$ on the unit circle. Then start walking anticlockwise at unit speed. It follows that if the time elapsed is $t$, your $x$-coordinate will be $\cos t$ and your $y$-coordinate will be $\sin t$. The above information can be organized into four statements: We walk on the unit circle centered at the origin. We position ourselves at $(1,0)$ to begin with. We walk at unit speed. We walk anticlockwise.

Using the IVP definition of $\cos$ and $\sin$, how can we show that $\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x) = 1$? I'm looking for a satisfying proof that I can present to young people, so: no complex numbers, and no power series, and, more generally no ""magic""! In fact, the closer the proof is to being ""just plain algebra"", the better. Motivation. There's a geometric way of defining the circular functions: first, position yourself at $(1,0)$ on the unit circle. Then start walking anticlockwise at unit speed. It follows that if the time elapsed is $t$, your $x$-coordinate will be $\cos t$ and your $y$-coordinate will be $\sin t$. The above information can be organized into four statements: We walk on the unit circle centered at the origin. We position ourselves at $(1,0)$ to begin with. We walk at unit speed. We walk anticlockwise. These can be formalized as follows: $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1$ $\cos(0) = 1, \sin(0) = 0$ $(\cos't)^2+(\sin't)^2 = 1$ $\sin'(0) > 0$ Now conditions 2 and 4 follow easily from the IVP definition.

In this proof, Hardy is using an approximation and the proof is based on the fact that two triangles are approximately similar due to very small differentials. On the left image, the similar triangles are CDE and ABC. Based on that he derives into a differential equation that solving it produces the pythagorean theorem formula we all know. My question is regarding the validity of the approximation. If the same way of though is used for any non-right triangle as seen in the right image, you can derive the pythagorean theorem formula for any triangle and thus make a wrong assumption as the pythagorean theorem does not stand for non-right triangles.

In addition to the specific answer, some general insight will be most welcome. We have got a number of similar problems in hand. So, unless we can develop some acumen, life may become difficult.","Please take a look at this trigonometric equation, $\cos9x\cos7x = \cos5x\cos3x$ To solve this equation, we can proceed as, $2\cos9x\cos7x = 2\cos5x\cos3x$ or, $\cos(9x+7x)+\cos(9x-7x) = \cos(5x+3x)+\cos(5x-3x)$ or, $\cos16x+\cos2x = \cos8x+\cos2x$ or, $\cos16x = \cos8x$ From the above situation we can proceed in two ways, First Way $\cos16x = \cos8x$ or, $\cos(2\times8x) = \cos8x$ or, $2\cos^28x -1 = \cos8x$ or, $2\cos^28x-\cos8x -1 = 0$ or, $2\cos^28x-2\cos8x+\cos8x -1 = 0$ or, $2\cos8x(\cos8x-1)+(\cos8x -1) = 0$ or, $2\cos8x(\cos8x-1)+(\cos8x -1) = 0$ or, $(\cos8x -1)(2\cos8x+1) = 0$ Either or both of the above factors are zero.

So, as I did in the linked question, I  used  Bhaskara I's approximation (for $-\frac \pi 2 \leq x\leq\frac \pi 2$ ) $$\cos(x) \simeq\frac{\pi ^2-4x^2}{\pi ^2+x^2}\implies \cos\left(\frac{p\,\pi}{2k}\right)=\frac{4 \left(k^2-p^2\right)}{4 k^2+p^2}$$ and then computed $$B_p=\prod _{k=p+1}^{\infty }\frac{4 \left(k^2-p^2\right)}{4 k^2+p^2}=\frac{\Gamma \left( p+1-i\frac p 2\right)\,\, \Gamma    \left( p+1+i\frac p 2\right)}{(2p)!}\tag 2$$ which does not seem to be very bad (see the table below). Using Stirling approximation and Taylor series for supposed large values of $p$ , I ended with $$\log(B_p)=\frac 12\log \left(\frac{5\pi}{4}\right)-\left(\log \left(\frac{16}{5}\right)+\cot ^{-1}(2)\right)p+\frac 12 \log(p)+\frac{11}{120 p}+O\left(\frac{1}{p^3}\right)\tag 3$$ What is interesting is to notice that $$\log \left(\frac{16}{5}\right)+\cot ^{-1}(2)\approx 1.62680$$ which is not so far from $\frac \pi 2$ ( $3.56$ % relative difference) and this already bring questions (at least, to me).

99,Find elevator height given rope length?,Find elevator height given rope length?,,"This question is deceptively difficult. I feel like it's probably some classic example somewhere, but I'm not sure how to describe it in enough detail to get valid results in searching online. Problem Statement There is an elevator, which is pulled up by a rope. The rope wraps around the pulley (shown in the picture) before accumulating on the elevator wire drum. The pulley diameter $r$ is known and the distance from the pulley to vertical $x$ is known. The elevator rope makes some wrap around the pulley ($\theta$) before travelling to the center of the top of the elevator. Assume there is an identical setup on the other side with identical setup and parameters. Given the length of payed out rope $L$, equal to the blue + green lengths shown in the image, what is the height $y$ of the elevator? My Approach The section in blue is equal to the rope wrapped around the pulley and the section in green is equal to the total rope length minus that amount. Defining the green section to be $a$ and the blue section to be $b$: $$ L = a + b \\ b = r \theta \\ L = a + r\theta \\ a = L - r\theta \\ $$ Also, by similar triangles, the angle between green and vertical is also equal to $\theta$. Now, updating the drawing with this information: Treating the green section as a hypotenuse, there are effective legs $y'$ and $x'$, where: $$ y' = y - r\sin{\theta} \\ x' = x + r\cos{\theta} \\ $$ Then, using Pythagorean Theorem and the definition of $a$ above: $$ a = \sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} \\ L - r\theta = \sqrt{(x + r\cos{\theta})^2 + (y - r\sin{\theta})^2} $$ But this alone doesn't buy me much because I don't know $y$ or $\theta$. Two unknowns, one equation. I tried to find an expression for $\theta$ by exploiting the fact that the angle between $a$ and vertical is equal to the angle of wrap. I define a $b'$, which is equal to the path $a$ would have taken past the pulley had there been no wrap: $$ b' = r \tan{\theta} \\ $$ Now there's an $L'$, which is equal to $a + b'$, which again is a length laid from the pivot tangent to the pulley instead of wrapping around the pulley. There's also an $r'$, which is the distance from the middle of the pulley to this new $L'$-horizontal vertex: $$ r' = r \sec{\theta} \\ r' = \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}} \\ $$ And now, where previously the horizontal distance was $x + r$, now it's $x + r'$, and I can state: $$ L'\sin{\theta} = (x + r') \\ (a + b')\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\ (a + r\tan{\theta})\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\ (L - r\theta +  r\tan{\theta})\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\ $$ $$ (L + r(\tan{\theta} - \theta))\sin{\theta} = (x + \frac{r}{\cos{\theta}}) \\ $$ This is the best I can get at an expression for $\theta$, but Matlab is unable to find an explicit solution for $\theta$. With no expression for $\theta$, I can't solve for $y$ in the earlier equation. Is there any closed form solution to this problem, or do the functions of $\theta$ mean I'm stuck using a numeric solver?","This question is deceptively difficult.
