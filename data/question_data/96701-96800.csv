The claim is the following: Let $D\subset \mathbb C$ be connected and open and let $f: D \to \mathbb C$ be holomorphic. Then $f$ is analytic. The proof (what I understand so far): Let $z_0 \in D$. We must find an open ball around $z_0$ contained in $D$ and such that $f$ equals its Taylor series on the open ball. Step 1: Pick any $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B(z_0, \varepsilon) \subset D$ and apply Cauchy's integral formula to get $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} {f(z) \over z_0 - z} dz $$ Step 2: Expand the geometric series ${1\over 1 - {z \over z_0}}$ to get $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} f(z) {1\over z_0}\sum_{n}\left ({z\over z_0}\right )^n dz $$ Step 3: Use that the series converges absolutely (because it converges and so converges absolutely for smaller radii by Abel's theorem?) so that $\int$ and $\sum$ commute: $$ f(z_0) = {1\over 2 \pi i} \sum_{n}z^n\int_{\partial B(z_0, \varepsilon)} f(z) {1 \over z_0^{n+1}} dz = \sum_{n} c_n z^n $$ This proves that if $f$ is holomorphic then it is infinitely differentiable.

My idea was to apply the identity theorem to the Taylor series of $f$ and this power series above but the problem is that at this point I don't know that the Taylor series converges to $f$.

Firstly, I'd like to know how such an analytic continuation is obtained. Regarding the sinc function, I know that sine has a zero of order 1, and the denominator also does, so at $z=0$ , there is a removable singularity and thus an analytic continuation.
