0,Version of Lusin's theorem on real line,Version of Lusin's theorem on real line,,"I am trying to prove Lusin's theorem on the real line, I'll write the statement and my attempt at a proof: Statement Let $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a measurable function.

Attempt at a solution I've already proved this statement for $f:E \to \mathbb R$ with $E$ of finite measure.

Somehow, and I don't know why, I ""feel"" that I should be able to take $\{x_0,x_1,\ldots\}$ to be all the rational numbers in $[0,1]$, and get $\delta = 0$ with a ""nice"" choice of $\mathcal{F}_n$. Am I wrong in my calculations, and if I am right, why is this happening at an intuitive level? Is there any ""system"" (or a different kind of measure) where I would get $\delta = 0$ (with respect to that measure).",,['measure-theory']

By letting the same symbol $X$ denote the restriction of the vector field to $M$ , $X$ determines the motion of our point ( $x$ ) with unit velocity along geodesic lines in $M$ . Take any $x \in \mathrm{int}(M)\setminus \cup_{i\neq j}N_{i, j}$ where $\mathrm{int}(M)$ denotes the set of interior points of $M$ . According to the authors, there are two possible cases. 1.)

Suppose that $N_{i, j}$ is the set of all interior points $x\in M$ such that the segment of the geodesic line constructed in the direction $x$ intersects $\partial Q$ on $\partial Q_i\cap \partial Q_j$ .

The vector $y$ thus obtained will be put equal to $T_1x$ . Clearly if $x$ is in the set where $\{T^t\}$ is defined, then $T_1x = T^{f(x)}x$ , where $f(x)$ is the length of the geodesic segment. Question: Consider the following lemma Lemma $\mu(N^{(2)}) = 0$ . Proof: It is clear that if $x = T^{\tau}x^{-}$ and $x \in N^{(2)}$ , then all the points $x' = T^tx^{-}$ , $0 \leq t \leq f(x^{-})$ , belong to the set $N^{(2)}$ . Therefore $\mu(N^{(2)}) = \int_{N^{(2)}\cap M_1}f(x^{-})d\mu_1(x^{-})$ . But the last integral vanishes since $N^{(2)}\cap M_1$ consists of all the points $x$ for which the sums $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(T^k_1 x)$ remain bounded when $n\to \infty$ . The lemma is proved. $\square$ What I don't understand is why "" the sums $\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(T^k_1x)$ remain bounded "" $\implies$ "" the integral $\int_{N^{(2)}\cap M_1}f(x^{-})d\mu_1(x^{-})$ vanishes "".

My proof is so easy that i doubt it's valid: Notice that we only have to show it for $0 < m(E) < \infty$ , because if $m(E) = \infty$ then there is a subset $E' \subseteq E$ such that $0 < m(E') < \infty$ and therefore for all $0 < \varepsilon < 1$ there exists an interval $I \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $m(E \cap I) \geq m(E' \cap I) > (1 - \varepsilon) m(I)$ .

If we define $D := \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f \text{ is differentiable at } x\}$ and take a point $d \in D$ , then since $|f'(d)|$ acts like a local scale factor of $f$ around $d$ , it seems reasonable to expect that: $$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mu^*(f[I_{d,h}])}{2h} = |f'(d)|$$ where $\mu^*$ denotes Lebesgue outer measure, $I_{d,h} := (d-h,d+h)$ , and if $A$ is some set then $f[A]$ denotes the image of $A$ under $f$ . Unfortunately (as usual) mathematics is not so straightforward. Without too much effort, it follows by playing around with the definition of the derivative that: $$\limsup_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mu^*(f[I_{d,h}])}{2h} \leq |f'(d)|$$ and hence we get the desired equality above if $f'(d) = 0$ . But the more general result can fail in seemingly pathologically counterexamples. For example it's possible to construct a measurable function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q} \cup C$ (where $C$ is the Cantor set) which is differentiable on all of $C$ , and $f'(x) = 1$ for all $x \in C$ . However this is a pretty pathologically example, and even then it only fails on a null set. So my conjecture is the following: Given that $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary function, and $D := \{x \in \mathbb{R} : f \text{ is differentiable at } x\}$ . Then: $$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{\mu^*(f[I_{d,h}])}{2h} = |f'(d)|$$ for almost all $d \in D$ .

51,Understanding the difference between convergence in measure and convergence almost everywhere.,Understanding the difference between convergence in measure and convergence almost everywhere.,,"My concern arises when I was going over the proof that if $f_n\rightarrow_\mu f$ , then for some subsequence $n_k$ we have $f_{n_k}\rightarrow_{a.e.}f$ , provided that $\{f_n\}$ are measurable and finite a.e. To me, I don't quite get the intuitive difference between convergence in measure and convergence almost everywhere very well. My characterization of convergence almost everywhere will be something like $$\mu(\{\lim f_n\neq f\})=0 \Leftrightarrow \mu(\lim |f_n-f|\neq0)=0$$ and convergence in measure would be $$\lim \mu(|f_n-f|\geq\epsilon)=0$$ In short, I distinguish the two concepts by thinking one has the limit operator inside the measure one is outside, so intuitively converge almost everywhere must be stronger. (I know it is only the case when the measure is finite, which I don't quite get yet.) However, when attempted to prove the statement, I confused myself when writing down the condition: $$\forall \epsilon>0, \mu(|f_n-f|\geq\epsilon)\rightarrow0,n\rightarrow\infty$$ It is clear that to attempt this question, I should construct a subsequence that is convergent almost everywhere. What I first think of is to write something like $$\mu(|f_n-f|\geq1/2^k)<1/2^k$$ but then I got stuck. I have no intuitive understanding of what kind of subsequence indexed by $k$ should I obtain from this condition. If I pick up $\{f_n\}$ such that the condition hold, find the $f_n$ with smallest $n$ and indext it by $k$ , let $k\rightarrow \infty$ , the choice of sequence seems more likely to follow the pattern of the original sequence. I looked at the textbook and here is the full step of the proof: for every positive integer $k$ , $\exists n_k,$ when $n\geq n_k$ $$\mu(|f_n-f|\geq1/2^k)<1/2^k$$ Suppose $n_1<n_2....<n_k<...$ , $f'_k\equiv f_{n_k},k=1,2,....$ is a subsequence of $\{f_n\}$ and it is convergent a.e. to $f$ . In fact, $\forall \epsilon>0$ \begin{align} \mu(\bigcap_k\bigcup_v|f'_{k+v}-f|\geq\epsilon) & \leq \mu(\bigcup_v|f'_{k_0+v}-f|\geq\epsilon)\text{  for every $k_0$} \\  & \leq \sum_v\mu(|f'_{k_0+v}-f|\geq\epsilon) \\   & \leq \sum_v \mu(|f'_{k_0+v}-f|\geq\frac{1}{2^{k_0+v}})\ (\frac{1}{2^{k_0}}<\epsilon) \\  & \leq \sum \frac{1}{2^{k_0+v}} \\   & = \frac{1}{2^{k_0}} \end{align} Since the inequality holds for any $k_0$ sufficiently large, $\mu(\bigcap_k\bigcup_v|f'_{k+v}-f|\geq\epsilon)=0.$ I quite enjoy the proof as it is clearly written and easy to follow, however, it doesn't very intuitive to me what has been done to the condition that allows the subsequence to have this nice property.

Upon thinking about this question , I realized that this is not the case: the usual proof relies on translation-invariance and Fubini, but Fubini itself relies on $\sigma$ -finiteness which is not true of $\eta_d$ ; for the Haar measure on a locally compact abelian group, which is not necessarily $\sigma$ -finite, one can get away with ""regularity"" instead (even though things appear to be confused ), but now I'm struggling to understand what works or does not work for Hausdorff measures.  So let me ask about a concrete case: Let $d = \log 2/\log 3$ and let $\eta = \eta_d$ be the $d$ -dimensional Hausdorff measure on $\mathbb{R}$ , normalized so that the usual Cantor middle-third set $C$ has $\eta(C)=1$ .  Let $f = \mathbf{1}_C$ be the indicator function of $C$ and $\nu = f \eta$ (that is, $E \mapsto \int_E f\, \mathrm{d}\eta$ ) be the ""uniform"" probability measure on $C$ .  We define the convoluted function $g := f\mathbin{*_\eta}f = f*\nu$ as $$x \mapsto \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(y)\, f(x-y)\, \mathrm{d}\eta(y) = \int_{C} f(x-y)\,\mathrm{d}\nu(y)$$ and we define the convoluted measure $\xi := \nu*\nu$ as $$E \mapsto (\nu\times\nu)(\{(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^2 : y+z\in E\})$$ To put it more simply, $g(x)$ is the probability that, if $y$ is chosen uniformly in the Cantor set, $x-y$ also falls in the Cantor set; whereas $\xi(E)$ is the probability that two given reals $y,z$ both chosen uniformly and independently in the Cantor set have a sum in $E$ . Naïvely one would like to think that $\int_E g\, \mathrm{d}\eta = \xi(E)$ (for $E$ a Borel set) with the following ""proof"": $$\begin{aligned}\int_E g\, \mathrm{d}\eta &= \int_E\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x-y)\, \mathrm{d}\nu(y)\right) \mathrm{d}\eta(x)\\ &= \int_{E\times\mathbb{R}} f(x-y)\, \mathrm{d}\nu(y)\, \mathrm{d}\eta(x)\\ &= \int_{\{(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^2 : y+z\in E\}} f(z)\, \mathrm{d}\nu(y)\, \mathrm{d}\eta(z)\\ &= \int_{\{(y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^2 : y+z\in E\}} \mathrm{d}\nu(y)\, \mathrm{d}\nu(z)\\ &= \xi(E)\end{aligned}$$ but as explained above, this proof does not work.

95,Variation of a signed measure,Variation of a signed measure,,"This is Exercise 3.P in Bartle's The Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure . I think I have a proof but would appreciate it if anyone can spot any mistakes or suggest any improvements. If $\mu$ is a charge [Bartle's term for a finite signed measure] on a sigma-algebra $\Sigma$ , let $\nu$ be defined for $E \in \Sigma$ by $$\nu(E) = \sup \sum_{j=1}^{n}|\mu(A_j)|$$ where the supremum is taken over all finite disjoint collections $\{A_j\}$ in $\Sigma$ with $E = \cup_{j=1}^{n} A_j$ . Show that $\nu$ is a measure on $\Sigma$ . (It is called the **variation** of $\mu$ .) It is clear that $\nu(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\nu(E) \geq 0$ for all $E \in \Sigma$ , so we need to show that $\nu$ is countably additive. Suppose that $(E_k)$ is a disjoint sequence of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ . For each $k$ , let $\{A_{jk}\}_{j=1}^{n_k}$ be a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ such that $E_k = \cup_{j=1}^{n_k}A_{jk}$ . Then $$\{A_{jk} : k=1,\ldots,N\ \text{and}\ j=1,\ldots,n_k\}\ \text{and}\ E\setminus(\cup_{k=1}^{N}E_k)$$ is a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ . Therefore, $$\sum_{k=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\mu(A_{jk})| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{n_k}|\mu(A_{jk})| + |\mu(E\setminus(\cup_{k=1}^{N}E_k))| \leq \nu(E)$$ Taking the supremum for each fixed $k$ , we obtain $$\sum_{k=1}^{N}\nu(E_k) \leq \nu(E)$$ Taking the limit as $N \to \infty$ , it follows that $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k) \leq \nu(E)$$ For the reverse inequality, fix $\epsilon > 0$ and let $\{B_m\}_{m=1}^{M}$ be a finite disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $E$ , such that $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m)| + \epsilon$$ Note that $\{B_m \cap E_k : k \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a countable disjoint collection of sets in $\Sigma$ whose union is $B_m$ . Since $\mu$ is a charge, it is countably additive, so $$\mu(B_m) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_m \cap E_k)$$ Therefore, $$\begin{aligned} \nu(E) &\leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}\left|\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(B_m \cap E_k)\right| + \epsilon \\ &\leq \sum_{m=1}^{M}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| + \epsilon \\ &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| + \epsilon \\ \end{aligned}$$ Changing the order of the summation is valid because of Tonneli’s Theorem, that is, the summands are nonnegative, so the double sum can be performed in any order without changing the result, even if it is infinite. Now $E_k$ is the disjoint union of $\{B_m \cap E_k : m = 1,\ldots,M\}$ , so $$\sum_{m=1}^{M}|\mu(B_m \cap E_k)| \leq \nu(E_k)$$ Therefore, $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k) + \epsilon$$ Since this inequality holds for any $\epsilon > 0$ , we conclude that $$\nu(E) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\nu(E_k)$$","This is Exercise 3.P in Bartle's The Elements of Integration and Lebesgue Measure .
