1,Uniform sampling of points on a simplex,Uniform sampling of points on a simplex,,"I have this problem: I'm trying to sample the relation $$ \sum_{i=1}^N x_i = 1 $$ in the domain where $x_i>0\ \forall i$. Right now I'm just extracting $N$ random numbers $u_i$ from a uniform distribution $[0,1]$ and then I transform them into $x_i$ by using $$ x_i = \frac{u_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N{u_i}}. $$ This is correct but requires me three $u_i$ to have a sample of the relation. If $N=2$, then the relation simplify into $x_1 + x_2 = 1$ and I can easily extract one $u_1 = x_1$ and evaluate the other as $x_2 = 1 - x_1$, therefore using only one extraction. But if I do the same with $N=3$, I can have $u_1 = 0.8$, $u_2 = 0.7$ and I can't just use the first relation to evaluate the $x_i$ and I cannot combine it with the second one, since I don't know the $\sum u_i$. How can I sample the $x_i$ that satisfies the first relation while only picking $N-1$ values from a random distribution (preferably the uniform one)? And what kind of mathematical problem is this?

5,Products of distributions in QFT,Products of distributions in QFT,,"In Quantum Field Theory quantum fields are operator valued distributions. Namely, given the Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}(M)$ defined on Minkowski spacetime $M$, fields are continuous linear maps $\phi : \mathcal{S}(M)\to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H})$ which gives back for each function one operator in some Hilbert space. When just free fields are considered this is just fine. Now, when one considers interactions, the issue that appears is that we have to deal with products of quantum fields. For instance, the $\phi^4$ theory has the interaction given by $\lambda \phi^4$. The scalar Yukawa theory also has products of fields. The field equations become non-linear in the fields. The issue now is that if quantum fields are distributions, then necessarily we can't deal with these terms, because products of distributions is not defined. Physicists just ignore this most of the time. My question here is: is there a rigorous known way to deal with this? Can we make this rigorous someway, even if we need to go into approximate theories? Or there is no way currently known to make this rigorous? Edit: For more information on this matter, I've asked on Physics.SE about the issues with interacting QFT and found out the main problems. This product problem seemed the worst, and since the point here is about whether or not a mathematical construct can be made rigorous I thought that Math.SE could be a good place to discuss the matter further.","In Quantum Field Theory quantum fields are operator valued distributions.

13,Intuition for the Lax-Milgram Theorem,Intuition for the Lax-Milgram Theorem,,"I have seen the proof of the Lax-Milgram theorem (and can replicate it with most of the details), I've also applied it for a bi-linear form defined as the weak formulation of a PDE to show the existence of a solution. I still don't get the idea behind it. Is there an equivalent in finite dimensional linear algebra to give me some intuition? Lax milgram says: $a:H \times H \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous, coercive, symmetric, then: $\forall \phi \in H^{\ast}, \exists ! u \in H$ such that $a(u,v) = \phi(v)$ for all $v \in H$ . This $u$ is the only minimiser of $H$ of the problem $$ \inf_{v \in H}\left\{\frac{1}{2}a(v,v)-\phi(v)\right\}$$ More concretely, my questions are: What is (1), some kind of dimension reduction? How did (2) come about? It's so useful in the context of PDEs but its mysterious to me. What's the finite dimensional intuition I can draw from? EDIT: I had some time to think about this. Take $H:=\mathbb{R}^n$ . In this simple finite dimensional context, $a(u,v) := \langle u,v\rangle$ is the natural choice for a continuous, coercive, and symmetric bilinear form. Then the dual is the space of all row vectors. So Lax-Milgram tells us that $\forall r \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^{\ast}$ there exists a unique $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\langle u,v\rangle = r v$ for all $v \in \mathbb{R}$ , i.e. the only one is $r=u^T$ . It just tells us a different way to write the dot product using elements in the dual. As for the minimisation problem, Lax-Milgram says that the solution to this minimisation problem would be $$\frac{1}{2} \langle u, u \rangle - \langle u,u\rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\|u\|^2$$ I am at a loss for what this represents, but I now have some intuition for the first result!

It is easy to prove that, for every $\theta$, $T$ is a bounded linear operator of $\ell^2$ into itself, that $\lVert T\rVert =1$ and that $T$ is selfadjoint iff $\theta =\ frac{1}{2}$. Moreover $T$ is not compact: in fact, if $e^m:=(\delta_n^m)$ (so $e^m$ is a vector of the canonical base of $\ell^2$), one has: $$|Te^m -Te^p|^2=\begin{cases} 0 &\text{, if } p=m \\ \theta^2 +(1-\theta)^2+1 &\text{, if } m=p+2 \text{ or } p=m+2 \\ 2\theta^2+2(1-\theta)^2 &\text{, otherwise} \end{cases} \; ,$$ thus $|Te^m-Te^p|^2> \theta^2+(1-\theta)^2>0$ for $m\neq p$; therefore the sequence $\{ Te^m\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}}$ does not contain any Cauchy's subsequence.

About the eigenvalues, the only thing I know for sure is that $1$ is not in the point spectrum of $T$ for any value of $\theta$: in fact if $1$ were in the point spectrum $\sigma_P(T)$, then the eigenvectors would satisfy the linear recurrence: $$x_n=\theta x_{n-1}+(1-\theta) x_{n+1} \; ,$$ hence they have to be sequences of the type: $$x_n=A \left( \frac{\theta}{1-\theta}\right)^n +B$$ ($A,B$ suitable constants); but a sequence like this doesn't belong to $\ell^2$ except in the trivial case $A=B=0$, which however doesn't give a valid eigenvector.

44,Characterization of weak convergence in $\ell_\infty$,Characterization of weak convergence in,\ell_\infty,"Is there some simple characterization of weak convergence of sequences in the space $\ell_\infty$? If yes, is there some similar claim for nets? I was only able to come up with a characterization of sequential weak convergence using limit along ultrafilters, which I will describe below. I wonder whether there is some insight into this characterization. (E.g. whether there is some simple reformulations which does not use ultralimits.) Moreover, I do not know whether at least this characterization works for nets, too. We have the following result describing weak convergence in $C(K)$, see e.g. Corollary 3.138, p.140 in Banach Space Theory by Fabian, Habala et al. (It is a consequence of Rainwater theorem and characterization of extreme points of unit ball in $C(K)^*$.) Let $K$ be a compact topological space. Let $\{f_n\}$ be a bounded sequence in $C(K)$ and $f\in C(K)$. Then, if $f_n\to f$ pointwise, we have $f_n\overset{w}\to f$. Moreover we have isometric isomorphism between $\ell_\infty$ and $C(\beta\mathbb N)$, which is described e.g. in the Wikipedia article on Stone–Čech compactification or in Chapter 15 of Carothers' book A short course on Banach space theory . This isomorphism assigns to each bounded sequence $(x_n)$ the continuous function $\overline x$ on $\beta\mathbb N$ defined by $$\overline x(\mathscr U) = \operatorname{\mathscr U-lim} x_n,$$ where $\operatorname{\mathscr U-lim} x_n$ denotes the ultralimit of $x_n$ w.r.t the ultrafilter $\mathscr U$. Combining the above results we get the following characterization: Let $f^{(n)},f\in\ell_\infty$. The sequence $f^{(n)}$ converges to $f$ weakly if and only if for every ultrafilter $\mathscr U$    $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \operatorname{\mathscr U-lim} f^{(n)}= \operatorname{\mathscr U-lim} f.$$ (The above claim for principal ultrafilters is just a pointwise convergence.

74,A relative compactness criterion in $\ell^p$,A relative compactness criterion in,\ell^p,"There is a relative compactness criterion for subset of $\ell^p$ that seems to me to be almost unheard-of (I say that because a google search provided no proofs nor references) but that is very useful: Theorem. For any $p$, $1\leq p < \infty$, a bounded subset $K$ of $\ell^p$ is relatively compact if and only if $\displaystyle\lim_{n_\epsilon} \sum_{i=n_\epsilon}^\infty \vert k_i \rvert^p = 0$, uniformly for $k \in K$. This theorem is assigned as exercise in Diestel (see below) and is widely applied in Costara-Popa in order to prove relative compactness in $\ell^p$ (a classical example is to show that the operator $T : \ell^p \to \ell^p$ defined by $( T a )_n = \lambda_n a_n$ for all $a \in \ell^p$ is compact iff $(l_n) \in c_0$). However, I founded its proof rather tricky. My idea is essentially showing that a subset such as in theorem is totally bounded. (since in this way the result follows by well-established equivalence between totally boundeness and relative compactness in metric spaces.) Thus, chosen $\epsilon >0$, I was looking for a finite collection $S$ of vectors in $\ell^p$ such that every vector in $K$ is far from at last one vector in $S$ less than $\epsilon$.  The condition in theorem means that, fixed $\eta > 0$, there exists $n_\eta \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $\sum_{i=n}^\infty \lvert k_i \rvert^p < \eta^p$ and $n_\eta$ is the same for all $k \in K$ (depending only on $\eta$). Furthermore, since $K$ is bounded, there exists $M>0$ s.t. $\lVert k \rVert_p \leq M$ for all $k\in K$. So I'd consider a collection of vectors $u^{(j)}$ that have only $n_\eta$ non-zero components and set their values in such a way that \begin{equation} \lVert k- u^{(j)} \rVert_ p^p = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p =\sum_{i=1}^{n_\eta} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p + \sum_{i=n_\eta}^\infty \lvert k_i \rvert^p < \epsilon^p \end{equation} Since the second summation in the third term is less than $\eta^p$ (and $\eta$ could be arbitrary small, in particular smaller than $\epsilon$), it remains only to show that it is possible to have $\sum_{i=1}^{n_\epsilon} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p \leq \epsilon^p - \eta^p$. Set $r^p = \frac{\epsilon^p - \eta^p}{n_\eta ( M+1 ) }$ and choose $N \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $Nr^p \geq M$. Suppose that each component of $u^{(j)}$ takes one of the $2N + 1$ values $0, \pm r^p, \pm 2r^p, \dots, \pm N r^p$. Since $-M \leq k_i \leq M$ for every $i \leq n_\eta$, there exists an integer $C$ with $-N + 1 \leq C \leq N$ s.t. $(C - 1 )r^p \leq k_i \leq C r^p$. Then set $u_i^{(j)} = C r^p$. Thus \begin{equation} \sum_{i=1}^{n_\epsilon} \lvert k_i - u_i^{(j)} \rvert^p < \epsilon^p - \eta^p \end{equation} by construction.

Popa, Exercises in Functional Analysis .","There is a relative compactness criterion for subset of $\ell^p$ that seems to me to be almost unheard-of (I say that because a google search provided no proofs nor references) but that is very useful: Theorem. For any $p$, $1\leq p < \infty$, a bounded subset $K$ of $\ell^p$ is relatively compact if and only if $\displaystyle\lim_{n_\epsilon} \sum_{i=n_\epsilon}^\infty \vert k_i \rvert^p = 0$, uniformly for $k \in K$. This theorem is assigned as exercise in Diestel (see below) and is widely applied in Costara-Popa in order to prove relative compactness in $\ell^p$ (a classical example is to show that the operator $T : \ell^p \to \ell^p$ defined by $( T a )_n = \lambda_n a_n$ for all $a \in \ell^p$ is compact iff $(l_n) \in c_0$). However, I founded its proof rather tricky. My idea is essentially showing that a subset such as in theorem is totally bounded. (since in this way the result follows by well-established equivalence between totally boundeness and relative compactness in metric spaces.)

Set $r^p = \frac{\epsilon^p - \eta^p}{n_\eta ( M+1 ) }$ and choose $N \in \mathbb N$ s.t. $Nr^p \geq M$. Suppose that each component of $u^{(j)}$ takes one of the $2N + 1$ values $0, \pm r^p, \pm 2r^p, \dots, \pm N r^p$. Since $-M \leq k_i \leq M$ for every $i \leq n_\eta$, there exists an integer $C$ with $-N + 1 \leq C \leq N$ s.t. $(C - 1 )r^p \leq k_i \leq C r^p$. Then set $u_i^{(j)} = C r^p$.

As we all know, the formulation of the basic ideas from QM relies heavily on the notion of Hilbert Space.

However, things started to get confusing when the teacher introduced the inner product of the quantum states.

He then went on to explain the continuous case by first introducing the thing called ""completeness relation"" $$ 1=\sum |i\rangle\langle i| $$  where $|i\rangle$'s are the normalized eigenvectors of an Hermitian Operator. I, as the only math major in the class, recognize the term on the RHS as the projector into the subspace spanned by the orthonormal sequence $(|i\rangle)_{i=1}^\infty$, which is equal to identity since the sequence is complete. He then went on to find a way to calculate $\langle \psi  |\phi \rangle$ in the case where $|\phi \rangle$,$|\psi \rangle\in L^2[-a,a]$, the so-called infinite square well.

I had always seen the relation as THE definition of inner product in $L^2$ space, not something to be derived.

However the word ""physicist"" and ""rigor"" are usually mutually exclusive), I've learned about existence of Rigged Hilbert space and heard that it partially resolve some foundational issues with using Dirac's delta in QM. Here's my questions: 1.) I wonder if the notation $\int |x\rangle\langle x|dx$ has definite meaning in the Rigged Hilbert space? 2.) Could anyone please explain to me if the derivation is sound in ANY mathematical theory? Note that I'm an undergraduate so I'd really appreciate some not-to-advanced answers :) Thank you in advance.

When I asked him questions about the derivation he tried to justify it by saying something about Dirac's delta being an element of the Hilbert space (the irony) and the family of shifted Dirac's delta constitutes a basis (in some vague sense) of $L^2[-a,a]$. While knowing that my teacher's statement makes little sense in the theory of Hilbert space, which is not untypical of a physicist by the way (This is not meant to be an accusation by any mean, I really respect him and he's a good physicist. However the word ""physicist"" and ""rigor"" are usually mutually exclusive), I've learned about existence of Rigged Hilbert space and heard that it partially resolve some foundational issues with using Dirac's delta in QM. Here's my questions: 1.) I wonder if the notation $\int |x\rangle\langle x|dx$ has definite meaning in the Rigged Hilbert space? 2.) Could anyone please explain to me if the derivation is sound in ANY mathematical theory? Note that I'm an undergraduate so I'd really appreciate some not-to-advanced answers :) Thank you in advance. Edit : What does $\langle x|\phi \rangle = \phi(x)$ means anyway? At first I think it looks like the evaluation map but now I'm not quite sure.",,"['functional-analysis', 'hilbert-spaces', 'mathematical-physics', 'distribution-theory', 'spectral-theory']"
96,Smallest constant of Lipschitz retraction from bounded to continuous functions,Smallest constant of Lipschitz retraction from bounded to continuous functions,,"Let $B$ be the space of all bounded functions $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ equipped with the supremum norm*. It contains $C$, the space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$, as a subspace. An $L$-Lipschitz retraction $R:B\to C$ is, by definition, a map such that $$R(f)=f \qquad \forall f\in C$$ $$\|R(f)-R(g)\|\le L\|f-g\| \qquad \forall f,g\in B$$ Question : Does there exist a $2$-Lipschitz retraction from $B$ onto $C$? I expect the answer to be negative, but so far was unable to find a suitable obstruction. Motivation It is known that there is a $20$-Lipschitz retraction; such a map (pretty complicated) is constructed in Theorem 1.6 in Geometric Nonlinear Functional Analysis by Benyamini and Lindenstrauss. The constant $20$ could probably be lowered by tweaking their construction, but I am not interested in that right now. There is no $L$-Lipschitz retraction for $L<2$. (Proof below). The constant $2$ is known to be smallest possible for Lipschitz retraction from $\ell_\infty$ onto $c_0$ (Example 1.5 in the same book). Proof of item 2 above . For $n\in \mathbb N$, let $f_n\in C$ be a function such that $f_n(x)=-1$ for $x\le \frac12-\frac1n$, $f_n(x)=1$ for $x\ge \frac12+\frac1n$, and $f_n$ is linear in between. Let $f(x)=\frac12 \operatorname{sign}(x-1/2)$. Note that $\|f-f_n\|\le 1/2$ for all $n$. Here is an illustration: $f$ in red, $f_n$ in blue. The function $R(f)$ must satisfy $\|R(f)-f_n\|\le L/2$ for all $n$. Therefore, $R(f)(x)\ge 1-L/2$ for $x>1/2$ and $R(f)(x)\le -1+L/2$ for $x<1/2$. Since $R(f)$ is continuous, it follows that $L\ge 2$. Remark on item 3 : a $2$-Lipschitz retraction from $\ell_\infty$ onto $c_0$ is obtained by mapping each $(x_n)\in \ell_\infty$ to $(x_n-\min(|x_n|,s)\operatorname{sign}x_n)$ where $s=\limsup|x_n|$. Since $s$ is a $1$-Lipschitz function on $\ell_\infty$, the resulting map is $2$-Lipschitz. (*) That is, $\|f\|=\sup_{[0,1]}|f|$. Note that $B$ is different from $L^\infty[0,1]$ because the functions that are equal a.e. are not identified, nor is there any measurability requirement.","Let $B$ be the space of all bounded functions $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb R$ equipped with the supremum norm*.

98,Is Reflexivity Necessary for the Weak and Weak* Topologies to Coincide?,Is Reflexivity Necessary for the Weak and Weak* Topologies to Coincide?,,"Let $X$ be a normed vector space, not necessarily Banach . Suppose that $X$ is not reflexive, implying the existence of such $\varphi\in X^{**}$ ($X^{**}$ being the double dual of $X$) of  that for any $x\in X$ there exists some $f_x\in X^*$ ($X^*$ being the dual of $X$) such that $\varphi(f_x)\neq f_x(x)$. My question is: in this case, is the weak* topology on $X^*$ necessarily strictly weaker than the weak topology on $X^*$? Another thread answers this question in the affirmative for Banach spaces. That is, if $X$ is Banach and the weak and weak* topologies on $X^*$ coincide, then $X$ must be reflexive; or, equivalently, if $X$ is Banach but not reflexive, then the weak* topology on $X^*$ must be strictly weaker than the weak topology on $X^*$. That proof relies on the fact that if $X$ is Banach and $X^*$ reflexive, then $X$ is reflexive. However, this latter result can be shown to fail if $X$ is not Banach. My strategy was to take the $\varphi\in X^{**}$ specified above and try constructing such an open set based on it in the weak topology on $X^*$ that is not open in the weak* topology, but I'm stuck with this approach. Any ideas or hints would appreciated. UPDATE: I got it. The claim is true even without assuming that $X$ is Banach. That is, if the weak and weak* topologies on $X^*$ coincide, then $X$ is necessarily reflexive (and, consequently, also Banach, but the point of my question was not assuming completeness in the proof of reflexivity).

The idea is based on lemma 4 and proposition 5 of these notes , in case anyone else is interested.
