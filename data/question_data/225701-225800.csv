I am working from Kirwan's book on algebraic curves. I was not totally happy with her proof of this theorem, so I wanted to see if I could rework it. The simplicity of my proof suggests I've forgotten some important details. In particular, the original proof required that we change coordinates so that the point [0 : 0 : 1] was on neither curve, nor did it lie on any line defined by any two points of intersection. So please correct any mistakes, since I'm still learning this :) Theorem. Given any two projective curves $P$ and $Q$ in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ of degrees $n$ and $m$ respectively which do not share a component, they meet at no more than $nm$ points. By a projective change of coordinates, we can assume that all points of intersection are finite . (That is, they do not lie on the line at infinity, $z=0$ ). I'm fairly sure this is easy enough to do by sending the line at infinity to any other line, as long as you're careful about what gets mapped to the point at infinity on the new line. Even if there is an error in the proof elsewhere, this seems like a productive thing to do since we can now work in affine space. Momentarily considering $P$ and $Q$ as elements of the ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y][z]$ and define their resultant with respect to $z$ , $R(x,y)$ . Because $P$ and $Q$ are homogeneous polynomials in $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ , we can show that $R(x,y)$ is homogeneous and of degree $nm$ . (This is a lemma Kirwan front-loads and proves at the end of the section). And so, we can factor $R(x,y)$ as $\kappa(\lambda_1 y - \mu_1 x) \dots (\lambda_{nm} y - \mu_{nm} x)$ . Notably, it has exactly $nm$ factors. Suppose $[\alpha : \beta : 1]$ is a common point of intersection. (We can assume the third compontent is $1$ since all such points are finite points). Then, as polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[\alpha, \beta][z]$ , $P(\alpha, \beta, z)$ and $Q(\alpha,\beta, z)$ have a common zero (namely, when $z=1$ ) and so $R(\alpha, \beta)$ must be zero, and so consequently, $\alpha y - \beta x$ must be a factor of $R(x, y)$ . Finally, suppose that that we have at least $nm + 1$ distinct points of intersection: $[\alpha_1 : \beta_1 : 1] \dots [\alpha_{nm+1} : \beta_{nm+1} : 1]$ . By the above argument, this makes $\alpha_i y - \beta_i x$ must be a factor of $R(x, y)$ for each $i$ . But this gives us at least $nm + 1$ distinct factors, while we counted exactly $nm$ earlier.

Such divisor is involved in the characterization of the Weil pairing. Hint from book: due to theory we know that the norm map $Nm_{\alpha}:M^{*}(C^{'})\rightarrow M^{*}(C)$ is surjective. So using the hypothesis, $\alpha_{*}(E)=(f)$ where $f$ is a meromorphic funtion on $C$, we get: $\alpha_{*}(E)=Nm_{\alpha}(g)$ with $g$ a meromorphic funtion on $C^{'}$. Put $D=E+(g)$.

Some years later, Mukai (Symplectic structure on the moduli space of sheaves on an abelian or K3 surface) discovered others Hyperkahler manifolds, namely the moduli space of (stable) sheaves on a K3 with fixed Mukai vector, which turned out to be deformation equivalents to the Hilbert scheme of points (and coincide with it for particular choices of the Mukai vector). In literature, all the authors (I have consulted) give these examples, but it seems strange to me that we have two (different) descriptions for the first deformation class and only one for the latter.

I have never seen an explicit explanation, and this fact does not strike me as completely obvious.","Consider the affine plane over $k$, i.e. Spec $k[x,y]$. There are three kinds of prime ideals: $(0)$, $(x-a,y-b)$, and $(f(x,y))$, for $f$ irreducible. Let the ideal $(f(x,y))$ correspond to the point $\eta$. Standard algebraic geometry textbooks say that the closure of $\eta$ consists of $\eta$ together with all closed points $(a,b)$  s.t. $f(a,b)=0$. In particular, if $f(a,b)=0$, then $(x-a,y-b)$ contains $(f(x,y))$. Could someone explain in detail why this is true?
