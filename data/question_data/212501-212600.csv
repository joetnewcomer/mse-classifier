Thanks","What is the probability that in a set of $52$ cards, there will be equally many cards between each ace? I tried this problem, but I am stuck. I know that there are $52!$ possible cases. If there are $k$ cards between each ace, than this would be likely event $\{A,k,A,k,A,k,A\}$. There is $4!$ ways to permute these aces, and cards between them $k!\cdot k!\cdot k!\cdot 3$, so that is $3\cdot 4!\cdot (k!)^3$ likely events. Another likely case would be $\{m,A,k,A,k,A,k,A\}$. Here it would be $4!\cdot (48-m)!\cdot 3$. Total number of likely events would be  $$\frac{3\cdot 4!\cdot (k!)^3+4!\cdot (48-m)!\cdot 3}{52!}$$ Of course, this cannot be right, because I have m and k in expression so it is not good. Where am I making mistake? And if there is some easier approach could you explain it in detail so I could really understand what is happening? Thanks",,['probability']
37,Proving subset sums with the pigeon hole principle,Proving subset sums with the pigeon hole principle,,"I'm having trouble with three problems dealing with the pigeon hole principle.

My attempts: For problem (1) I essentially tried to brute force it with a C++ program. I got some interesting results (if they turn out to be right). My program returned that there existed 9,880 possible sums for the first 40 positive integers (assuming size three) (e.g.) a+b+c and that there was only 112 unique sums. Therefore, by the pigeon hole principle there must be a sum which repeats. Problem (2) I honestly did not know how to deal with this problem. However, when I first read the question I did not think that m had an upper bound (i.e. it works for every m). But, now I'm not so sure and do not know where to start.

77,Rapid approximation of $\tanh(x)$,Rapid approximation of,\tanh(x),"This is kind of a signal processing/programming/mathematics crossover question.  At the moment it seems more math-related to me, but if the moderators feel it belongs elsewhere please feel free to migrate it. I'm working on a project where I have limited computational power and need to make a speedy approximation of the hyperbolic tangent function over a fairly large range of input arguments. Assuming the numbers are stored in fixed point with an 8 bit fractional part then the approximation to $\tanh(x)$ should work to the limit implied by the resolution, or for arguments  $\tanh^{-1}(\pm[1 - \frac{1}{2^8}]) \approx \pm3.1$.  I know that Taylor series will not converge fast enough over this range, and I haven't fully looked into it but I don't believe that a Chebyshev polynomial approximation will converge rapidly enough either.  For various reasons a table lookup is also not possible. $\tanh(x)$ is algebraically equivalent to $\mathrm{sgn}(x)(1 - \frac{2}{e^{2|x|} + 1})$.  This looks promising; a series expansion of $e^x$ converges better than $\tanh(x)$.  For a rapid numerical calculation on limited hardware the "" + 1"" in the denominator throws a wrench into the works - it means a division has to be carried out, and since many simple processors don't have ""hardware divide"" the division has to be done in software through repeated shifts and subtractions, which is achingly slow. To get around this I'm considering the following approach.  Instead of using $\mathrm{sgn}(x)(1 - \frac{2}{e^{2|x|} + 1})$ to exactly represent tanh(x), define the following similar type of function: $\mathrm{sgn}(x)A(1 - e^{-B|x|})$ for unknown constants A and B.  Then define a loss function: $f(x) = \int_0^{3.1}[\tanh(x) - A(1 - e^{-Bx})]^2dx$ Then use a numerical method (gradient descent?) to find the values of A and B that minimize the loss.  The problem of approximating $\tanh(x)$ rapidly is then converted into approximating $e^{-x}$ rapidly plus an extra subtraction and multiplication. $e^{-x} = \dfrac{1}{e^x} = \dfrac{1}{2^{x \log_2(e)}} = \dfrac{2^{-x}}{2^y}$, where y is the integer part and x is the fractional part.  Expressing $e^{-x}$ this way lets me reduce the range of the input argument; dividing an unsigned number by $2^y$ where y is a positive integer can be accomplished by logical shifting.  For arguments between 0 and -1 just eyeballing a Taylor series expansion of $2^x$ looks pretty good for just 3 terms. Does this approach seem reasonable, from a mathematical perspective? Pitfalls I haven't considered? Thanks for any advice. Edit: I should add that in this application (audio processing) I'm willing to trade off absolute accuracy of the calculated value in exchange for speed of processing and a function that works ""reasonably"" well over the entire range of input arguments - the return value for every argument in the approximation doesn't have to be accurate to the $2^{-8}$ limit implied by the resolution.","This is kind of a signal processing/programming/mathematics crossover question.

Expanding upon this, for any theta, $e^{i\theta}$ is equivalent to rotating $\theta$ radians around a unit circle. So it's obvious (if not intuitive) to me that $e^{(\pi/2)i} = i$ and $e^{2\pi i} = 1$ and so on. What I'm wondering is, intuitively, how is the natural logarithm related so closely to circles? My understanding of $e$ stems from exponential growth, and I don't see how that ties to rotation around a unit circle. I know the formulas, but I'm looking for an intuitive explanation. For example, when I used to ask how sin and cos related to circles, people would show me taylor series or tables with a bunch of values or tell me to use a calculator, but it didn't click until somebody told me that sin is just a measure of the height of a point as you travel around the unit circle. Then it all makes sense. I'm looking for that kind of explanation of $e$ - how is $e$ related to circles and why does $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$?","$e^{i \pi} = -1$. I get why this works from a sum-of-series perspective and from an integration perspective, as in I can evaluate the integrals and find this result. However, I don't understand it intuitively. Intuitively, what this means to me is that if you rotate pi radians around a unit circle, you will end up exactly opposite of where you started.

The function $\sin x+\cos x$ could be transformed using some trigonometric identities to a single function. In fact, WolframAlpha says it is equal to $\sqrt2\sin\left(x+\frac\pi4\right)$ and there also are some posts on this site about this equality . So probably in this way we could calculate $x$ from the first equation - and once we know $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ , we can calculate $\dfrac{1}{\sin x}+\dfrac{1}{\cos x}$ . Is there a simpler solution (perhaps avoiding explicitly finding $x$ )?","If then what's the value of Meaning the value of , (the denominator) without using the identities of trigonometry.
