7,Minimal number of masks to safely meet all contacts during pandemic,Minimal number of masks to safely meet all contacts during pandemic,,"This is a generalization of a variant of Doctor's Dilemma puzzle . The general problem Given an undirected connected graph $G$ , one meeting is organized for each edge. When two vertices meet each other, one or both can wear any number of available two-sided masks. All masks start out clean, but diseases spread from vertices and masks to vertices and masks, when they are in contact. Any mask can be safely inverted to swap its two sides. We do not want to risk any vertex spreading (WLOG, its own unique) disease to any other vertex. What is the minimal number of masks that we need to order? Given a graph $G$ , is there an efficient way to find minimal number of masks $M(G)$ ? Can we find exact solutions for $M$ for specific families of graphs? Was a similar problem discussed before? I'm looking for references. Lets represent a mask and its (inner, outer) contamination with $(I,O)$ . Short notation $v$ for $\{v\}$ will be used for one element contamination. For example, $(v,\{u,w\})$ is contaminated by $v$ on inner side, by $u$ and $w$ on outer side. Trivially $M(G)\lt |V|$ , where $|V|$ is the number of vertices. If everyone meets with everyone and only $v_n$ doesn't wear a mask, all masks will end up as $(v_i,v_n),i=1,\dots,n-1$ . For example , Given graph $K_{2,2}=C_4$ , it is known that $M=2$ . Let vertices be $\{a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2\}$ and edges be $\{a_1b_1,a_2b_1,a_2b_2,a_1b_2\}$ . First, $a_1b_1$ meet by $a_1$ wearing a clean mask and $b_1$ wearing a clean mask (or equivalently, $a_1$ wears two clean masks stacked on each other while $b_1$ doesn't wear any masks). This results in masks $(a_1,\emptyset),(\emptyset,b_1)$ . Then, $a_1b_2$ meet by $a_1$ wearing the mask that they already contaminated, but $b_2$ does not wear any mask. At the same time, to meet $a_2b_1$ , let $a_2$ wear clean side of mask contaminated by $b_1$ . These two meetings result in masks $(a_1,b_2),(a_2,b_1)$ . Finally, $a_2b_2$ can meet, resulting in masks $(a_2,\{b_1,a_1\}),(\{a_1,b_1\},b_2)$ . We see that at every step, no vertices were contaminated by new diseases, as requested. Notice that $M(G)\ge \left\lceil \frac{|V|}{2} \right\rceil$ where $|V|$ is the number of vertices of graph $G$ , as every vertex will contaminate at least one side of some mask, which confirms that $M=2$ is optimal here. Complete bipartite graphs Can we solve the problem for $K_{n,n}$ graphs? Let $a_i$ and $b_i$ be vertices in first and second set of bipartite graph . When $n=1$ one mask is trivial, and $n=2$ is the previous example. For $n\ge 3$ , It is not hard to see $M(K_{n,n})\le n+\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ , as: $a_i,i=1,\dots,\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ meet with $b_j,j=1,\dots,n$ by contaminating masks to $(a_i,\emptyset)(\emptyset,b_j)$ . Next $a_x$ meets all $b_j$ using all masks of form $(\emptyset,b_j)$ , contaminating them to $(a_x,b_j)$ . Remaining $a_k,k\gt\frac{n}{2}$ meet all $b_j$ using inverted and stacked masks $(\emptyset,a_i),(a_x,b_j)$ . But, this is not optimal. (Also, step 2. is not needed when $n$ is even.) This can be improved to: (see equivalent question on puzzling.SE ) $$M(K_{n,n})\le \left\lceil\frac{5n}{4}\right\rceil,$$ using a strategy that simulates $\frac{m}{2}$ new masks by stacking $m$ masks in pairs $(\emptyset,X),(Y,\emptyset)$ , until about half of $a_i$ met with all $b_j$ . Then, split $b_j$ into two groups and resolve remaining meetings. Can we prove that this improvement is optimal? Other families Can we find both upper and lower bound for some common families? E.g. In comments, someone asked about $K_{1,n}$ . In this case, the lower bound stated at the end of first example can be achieved. Therefore, $M(K_{1,n})=\left\lceil \frac{n+1}{2} \right\rceil$ . E.g. meeting $3$ consecutive edges with $2$ masks in cycle $C_n$ gives $M(C_n)\le \left\lfloor \frac{2n}{3} \right\rfloor$ . E.g. what about complete $K_n$ graphs? General algorithm Can there exist an efficient algorithm for an arbitrary graph? I can recognize three possible ways (moves) to meet some $v_i v_j$ , Contaminate both sides $(v_i, v_j)$ of a new mask $(\emptyset,\emptyset)$ . Contaminate a side $(v_i, v_j)$ of an existing mask $(v_i,\emptyset)$ or $(\emptyset,v_j)$ . Contaminate one side on one or both stacked masks $(v_i, X),(Y, v_j)$ . This will result in masks $(v_i, X\cup Y),(X\cup Y, v_j)$ , unless $(X, Y)$ exists to be placed in between.

17,How strong is the statement that Thompson F is amenable?,How strong is the statement that Thompson F is amenable?,,"Justin Moore's proof turned out to have an error I just attended Justin Moore's talk on this today. Since I am neither a group theorist nor a combinatorist, and is not familiar with ultrafilters I cannot judge the correctness of his proof. But more elementary - if Thompson's group F is amenable, what would this signify? Can we deduce some non-elementary results from this statement? I was not able to ask this in person, but it seems this would imply the amenability of some other related groups as well. Any comments, answer, etc are welcome. I suspect this is too low for mathoverflow (as I am not a researcher in this field) so I ask in here. To cite the background, the wikipedia link on Thompson group F is here . Justin Moore's proof is here . Some related mathoverflow question can be found at here , here , and there . I have read about 60 pages' paper not related to Justin Moore's proof on F in the past, and raise the question under this context. Also, often that the statement itself is not significant (like Fermat's last theorem), but what mathematical structure the proof involved is important. So any comments, answers, etc on that direction is also welcome. I personally felt very surprised and happy to know ramsey theory was lurking in the background of the proof. A summary of Justin's proof is this (borrowed from others): The definition of amenability of a group G demands a. a positive measure m defined on all subsets of G b. m(G) = 1 c. m is finitely additive d. m is invariant under left mult by elements of G. The motivation for the definition is that amenable groups acting on other spaces allow for measures on the space with the properties above. Often a space can be found with a G action so that if a measure with the properties above can be found then the group is amenable. For F, such a space is the space T of all finite binary trees. The spaces of trees T has a binary operation. (Trees A and B are made into a tree A^B whose left subtree is A and right subtree is B). The space M of measures on T having all the properties but (d) inherits a binary operation from the binary operation ^ on T. An idempotent in M will have (d) and prove the amenability of F. There is a famous lemma that finds idempotents in spaces that are compact and have an associative operation. The space M is (I think) compact, but the operation is not associative. Moore's work is 30% proving (7) above and 70% generalizing the result (8) to the non-associative setting of the binary operation on M.","Justin Moore's proof turned out to have an error I just attended Justin Moore's talk on this today.

91,Multiplying the roots of polynomials using only their integer coefficients,Multiplying the roots of polynomials using only their integer coefficients,,"I am trying to write a function that takes the integer coefficients of two polynomials and returns the coefficients of a polynomial that has a root for each way you can multiply a root pair from the pair of input polynomial. The application I had in mind is representing algebraic numbers exactly. Instead of storing a given number $x$ as a float or a symbol, I'd store the coefficients of a polynomial that has $x$ as a root. Operating on numbers stored that way, without losing precision, requires operating on the roots without actually computing the roots. (It's clear to me that this representation strategy has serious flaws, both in terms of efficiency and multiplicity of solutions, but I still want to solve the problem.) Example Suppose the coefficient lists of the input polynomials are [1,0,-1] and [1,5,6]. That is to say, the input is the polynomial $x^2 - 1$ and the polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 6$. They have roots $-1,+1$ and $-2,-3$ respectively. Thus the output polynomial must have roots $-1 \cdot -2,-1 \cdot  -3,1 \cdot  -2,1 \cdot -3 = -3,-2,2,3$ and is equal to $(x-3)(x-2)(x+2)(x+3)$ which is $x^4 - 13x^2 + 36$ and so the output is [1,0,-13,0,36]. Partially Solved I have worked on the problem, and managed to factor the effects of the input polynomials into separate pieces (I think so, anyways). It would take far too long to explain how I got where I am... suffice it to say it was very ad-hoc.

I cut down the code as much as possible. Here's an alternate formulation of F, as a recursive function: private static BigInteger F2(IReadOnlyList<int> d, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> roots) {     var zeroes = d.Count(e => e == 0);     if (zeroes == d.Count) return 1;      var min = d.Min();     if (min > 0) {         var mecs = d.Where(e => e > 0).Select(e => e - min).ToArray();         return BigInteger.Pow(roots.Product(), min) * F2(mecs, roots);     }      var decs = d.Where(e => e > 0).ToArray();     return (from x in roots.Choose(d.Count - zeroes)             select F2(decs, x)             ).Sum(); } As you can see, the only dependence on the roots is for computing the function F. It does seem that it can always be reduced to an expression in terms of the coefficients... I can do it by hand for small degree polynomials, and can stumble towards reducing it for larger ones, but I don't see the pattern yet... Question So... Is this problem already solved? Is there a technique I should know about that might help? Am I missing something obvious? Update I used Jyrki's solution, and implemented it. You can find the code at my PolyNumber github repo .","I am trying to write a function that takes the integer coefficients of two polynomials and returns the coefficients of a polynomial that has a root for each way you can multiply a root pair from the pair of input polynomial. The application I had in mind is representing algebraic numbers exactly. Instead of storing a given number $x$ as a float or a symbol, I'd store the coefficients of a polynomial that has $x$ as a root. Operating on numbers stored that way, without losing precision, requires operating on the roots without actually computing the roots. (It's clear to me that this representation strategy has serious flaws, both in terms of efficiency and multiplicity of solutions, but I still want to solve the problem.) Example Suppose the coefficient lists of the input polynomials are [1,0,-1] and [1,5,6]. That is to say, the input is the polynomial $x^2 - 1$ and the polynomial $x^2 + 5x + 6$. They have roots $-1,+1$ and $-2,-3$ respectively. Thus the output polynomial must have roots $-1 \cdot -2,-1 \cdot  -3,1 \cdot  -2,1 \cdot -3 = -3,-2,2,3$ and is equal to $(x-3)(x-2)(x+2)(x+3)$ which is $x^4 - 13x^2 + 36$ and so the output is [1,0,-13,0,36]. Partially Solved I have worked on the problem, and managed to factor the effects of the input polynomials into separate pieces (I think so, anyways). It would take far too long to explain how I got where I am... suffice it to say it was very ad-hoc. The following function seems to compute what I want, and is almost independent of the roots: var decreasings = DecreasingSequencesOfSize(     length: poly1.Degree,      total: indexOfOutputCoefficient,      max: poly2.Degree);  var outputCoefficient =     (from coefRepeatSequence in decreasings      let coefs2Factor =          coefRepeatSequence         .Select(e => coefs2[e])         .Product()      let coefs1Factor = F(coefRepeatSequence, roots1, coefs1)      select coefs2Factor*coefs1Factor     ).Sum();  private static BigInteger F(IReadOnlyList<int> d, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> roots, IReadOnlyList<BigInteger> coefs) {     return (from p in d.DistinctPermutations()             select p.Select((e, i) => BigInteger.Pow(roots[i], e)).Product()            ).Sum(); } I'm sorry if that's not totally clear.

92,An upper bound for $\sum_{i = 1}^m \binom{i}{k}\frac{1}{2^i}$?,An upper bound for ?,\sum_{i = 1}^m \binom{i}{k}\frac{1}{2^i},"Does anyone know of a reasonable upper bound for the following: $$\sum_{i = 1}^m \frac{\binom{i}{k}}{2^i},$$ where we $k$ and $m$ are fixed positive integers, and we assume that $\binom{i}{k} = 0$ whenever $k > i$. One trivial upper bound uses the identity $\binom{i}{k} \le \binom{i}{\frac i2}$, and the fact that $\binom{i}{\frac{i}{2}} \le \frac{2^{i+1}}{\sqrt{i}}$, to give a bound of  $$2\sum_{i = 1}^m \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}},$$ where $\sum_{i = 1}^m \frac{1}{\sqrt{i}}$ is upper bounded by $2\sqrt{m}$, resulting in a bound of $4\sqrt{m}$.
