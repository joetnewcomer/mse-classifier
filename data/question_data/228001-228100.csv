In fact, anyone who has learned basic analytic geometry in high-school is already acquainted with at least one good example of a Cartesian product of sets. Does the concept of a co-product of sets have a useful life prior (or at least independent of) its role as obligatory example of elementary category theory? I'm looking for examples accessible to ""non-mathematicians"" (by which I really mean non-math-majoring undergraduates) in which the concept of a co-product of sets proves natural and useful (in the same way that, say, the product of two coordinate axes provides a natural and useful way to think about points on a plane). Epilogue The answers I received were very thought-provoking; thank you all! While thinking about MJD's and Martin Brandenburg's answers in particular my understanding of co-products of sets, and of their products for that matter, changed radically.  Now I've come to regard the co-product as a more natural and ubiquitous construct than the product 2 .  This is a complete reversal of how I saw them when I first posted my question.  I'd like put out these thoughts here, for whatever utility they may have for others, and whatever constructive criticism I may get. Since what follows is a bit long, here's the punchline: In $\def\Set{\mathbf{Set}}\Set$ , co-products are partitioned domains ; products are parametrized codomains. OK, here it goes.  After mulling over your answers, my thought now is that the standard description of the co-product in the $\Set$ category as "" the disjoint union"" makes it appear a lot more exotic than it is in reality.  Basically, the co-product arises whenever a domain is partitioned into subdomains : the partitioned domain is the co-product of these subdomains.  (The inclusion of the subdomains into the domain are, of course, the co-product's canonical inclusions.) This situation arises all the time .  Anyone who has been exposed to highschool math is familiar with piecewise definitions of functions, such as, for example, the standard definition of the absolute value function $|\cdot|:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ , $$ \left|x\right| = \left\{   \begin{array}{lr}     x, & \mathrm{if}\; x \ge 0\\     -x, & \mathrm{if}\; x < 0   \end{array} \right. $$ Such piecewise definitions amount to expressing the domain of a $\Set$ morphism (i.e. the function being defined) as the co-product of the domains of the ""pieces"" that the definition ""stitches together.""  In the example above, these stitched-together pieces are the $\Set$ morphisms $f_0:\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and $f_1:\mathbb{R}_{< 0}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ defined by $$ \begin{array}{lr}     f_0(x) = & x\\     f_1(x) = & -x \end{array} $$ But such maneuvers are not limited to Mathematics.  Every procedure whose first stage is a ""channeling"" of the input into one of several mutually exclusive cases (e.g. ""whites"" and ""colors""), and associates a different sub-procedure with each case (e.g. ""wash in hot water"" and ""wash in lukewarm water""), to finally produce an output of ""a uniform kind"" (e.g., ""washed laundry""), is one that fits the description of the co-product in $\Set$ . I think that what makes it so easy to miss the ubiquity of the co-product in $\Set$ is that expressions such as $$X = \bigsqcup X_\alpha$$ tend to be interpreted as describing a synthetic operation, namely, one that starts with some arbitrary sets $X_\alpha$ , and combines them into "" their disjoint union"".  My point is that in practice such a maneuver is rare in comparison to the one that goes in the ""opposite direction"", namely, the analytic operation that starts with some set $X$ , and partitions it into subsets $X_\alpha$ . The unfortunate irony here is that it is precisely the needs of the in-practice-rare synthetic operation that necessitates introducing an exotic ""disjoint union"" operation (and even more exotic constructions of it, via ""tagged sets"" and the like), since arbitrary sets $\{X_\alpha\}$ cannot be assumed to be pairwise-disjoint. In contrast, the analytic operation, which is readily recognizable by anyone who has ever sorted out a bunch of items into separate classes, is one that does not require introducing any new set operation.  (At most, it requires to formally define a partition of a set $X$ as a cover of $X$ consisting of pairwise-disjoint subsets of $X$ .) In light of the above, I've come to realize that the term ""disjoint union"" could also be interpreted simply as shorthand for ""a union of disjoint (and covering) subsets"", instead of an exotic new set operation.  (There's precedent in Mathematics for transposing the adjective from the parts to the whole; for example an ""open cover"" is defined as a ""cover by open sets"".) Thinking of the co-product in $\Set$ as an manipulation on a domain also sharpened my appreciation of the product in $\Set$ as a manipulation on a codomain : whereas the co-product partitions a domain into subdomains, the product parametrizes a codomain by component sets.  With the co-product, several functions that have disjoint domains and the same codomain are stitched together.  With the product, several functions that have the same domain, and ""independent"" codomains are bound together into a single composite function. As MJD's answer alluded to, in programming the co-product manifests itself as ""switch"" statements, or, more generally, as sequences of if , else if ... else if , else expressions: function f(x):     if test_1(x):         return f_1(x)     else if test_2(x):         return f_2(x)     ...     else:         return f_n(x)     end end Here, the domain $X$ of f is effectively partitioned into disjoint subsets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ , where $X_i$ consists of all those elements of $X$ for which test_i is true, and test_j is false for every $j < i$ .  The function f ""stitches together"" the functions f_1 , ..., f_n , having (effective) domains $X_1, \dots, X_n$ , respectively.  This function f is the ""unique morphism"" in $\Set$ , for the given f_1 , ..., f_n , that is guaranteed by the definition of the co-product. 3 In contrast, the product manifests itself in programming most commonly whenever real-world entities are modeled as composites of a finite number of parameters in such a way that (1) any two model objects are considered identical if and only if their parameter values parameters all match, (2) any combination of allowable values for the parameters represents a valid model object 4 .  The simplest example of this would be modeling space as a collection of three parameters, x , y , and z .  Then, for example: function pos(t):     return (pos_x(t), pos_y(t), pos_z(t)) The function pos ""bundles together"", the functions pos_x , pos_y , and pos_z .  It is the ""unique morphism"" in $\Set$ , for the given pos_x , pos_y , and pos_z , that is guaranteed by the definition of the product. Note that the function f given earlier is a function from the co-product (IOW the co-product serves as the domain), whereas the function pos given here is a function to the product (IOW, the product serves as the codomain).  This is characteristic. In short, the take-home message is: co-products are partitioned domains , products are parametrized codomains. Or better yet (as explained in footnote 2), sums are partitioned domains , cosums are parametrized codomains . 1 In the case of co-product I deliberately avoid the common practice of omitting the hyphen, as in cotangent , cohomology , cokernel , etc.  In natural language, juxtaposition is not associative (that's why, e.g., the components of the word unionized are parsed out differently by a chemist and a labor activist), and the non-standard, but plausibly intelligible, parsing ""copro-duct"" (literally: ""excrement conduit"") gives the unhyphenated version of the word a ... let's say, suspicious aura . 2 In fact, I now think that it's a bit unfortunate that learners of category theory are usually told about the co-product, and often summarily, only after being taught the product.

Then the slogan given elsewhere could be restated a bit more memorably as: sums are partitioned domains, cosums are parametrized codomains . 3 Pedantic caveat: in order to interpret f as the morphism guaranteed by the definition of the co-product, the f_i must be construed as the restrictions of the implemented functions to their effective domains $X_i$ .  In practice, the domains of the implemented functions f_i will often be proper supersets of their effective domains $X_i$ .  Still, considering only its role in the implementation of f , the domain of each f_i is indeed $X_i$ . 4 Note that these two conditions correspond, respectively, to the existence and uniqueness conditions on the morphism that is guaranteed by the definition of a product.  Dually, the conditions on the subsets of a partition, namely (1) that they be pairwise-disjoint, and (2) that they cover the original set, correspond, respectively, to the existence and uniqueness conditions on the morphism that is guaranteed by the definition of a co-product.","I had come across countless uses of the (Cartesian) product of sets long before I first ever met the concept of a ""co-product"" 1 of sets.

Now, while tweaking some sets, I came across this : We start with the natural numbers, $N$. We take the power set of the naturals, $P(N)$. Then we remove all the finite subsets of $N$ from $P(N)$. Let us call this new set $S$. This set is the set of all infinite subsets of $N$. It is easy to show that $S$ has uncountable cardinality, same as that of real numbers. This is because the removal of finite subsets only removes a countable number of elements. (Haven't posted this deduction, for it is very easy, but I may post it if it is not so evident) Now, we seek to find an ordering on the set $S$. Every set in this set is an infinite subset of natural numbers, so each of these sets are well ordered by the natural ordering of $N$. Taking any two sets in $S$, say $A$, and $B$, we seek to order them by checking their elements lexicographically. We compare the first two elements in $A$, and $B$.

And for the life of me, I can't shake this feeling I have that something is not quite right. Let me begin: First of all, I was reading Terry Tao's discussion about the construction of the standard number system and was very pleased with the way in which $\mathbb{C}$ can be systematically constructed from the natural numbers through a system of homomorphisms (as a direct limit): $$\mathbb{N} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ In particular, he talks about how the integers can be constructed as the space of equivalence classes of formal differences between natural numbers, where $$[a-b]\sim[c-d ] \iff a+d=b+c$$ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{N}.$ He then goes on to say "" with the arithmetic operations extended in a manner consistent with the laws of algebra ."" Now, for $(\mathbb{N},+,\cdot)$ addition is straight forward, and $$n\cdot k:=\underbrace{k+\cdots+k}_{n\;\text{times}}$$ is well defined with $n\cdot k=k\cdot n$. Moreover, the distributive law, $n\cdot(m+k)=n\cdot m+n\cdot k$, also holds. However, when I want to construct $(\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot)$ as above, I run into some trouble. Addition of two equivalence classes seems pretty straightforward, given by $$[a-b] + [c-d] := [ (a+c)-(b+d) ],$$ and is well defined. This makes sense as we simply ""add up"" the positive and negative amounts together. This definition also behaves nicely with the map $\varphi:\mathbb{N}\hookrightarrow\mathbb{Z}$, given by $n\mapsto[ n-0 ]$; with $\varphi(n+k)=\varphi(n)+\varphi(k)$, where the second addition is the addition of equivalence classes. Moreover, we have commutativity of addition; the existence of an additive identity, namely $[0-0]$; and the existence of additive inverses, $[a-b]+[b-a]\sim[0-0].$ But now, when I try to define the multiplication of classes, I am unsure how to proceed: If we consider our usual algebraic rules, we get that $$(a-b)\cdot(c-d)=a\cdot c-a\cdot d-b\cdot c+b\cdot d,$$ which might lead us to define the multiplication of two equivalence classes as $$[ a-b ]\cdot[ c-d ]:=[ (a\cdot c+b\cdot d)-(a\cdot c+b\cdot c) ].$$ Now it's easy to check that this is indeed well defined, and obeys the distributive law with the definition of addition we've given above. However I feel that we've simply gone in a circle (logically) as we've assumed a priori that $(-b)\cdot c=-(b\cdot c)$ and $(-b)\cdot(-d)=-(b\cdot d)$. Now, I am very familiar with the fact that if your set is a ring (with unity) then these results (particularly that negative times negative is positive ) come as simply a result of playing around with additive inverses and the distributive laws ( see here ). However my problem is that we've only gotten this ring structure on our set of equivalence classes by appealing to the ring structure of the integers, which is exactly the thing we are trying to construct from scratch! And I do not want to simply define multiplication in this way ""because it works""; it has always been my feeling that results like $(-1)\cdot(-1)=1$ should come as consequences of the structure, and not as properties we impose.
