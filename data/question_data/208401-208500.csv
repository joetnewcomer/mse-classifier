I want to show them how to do a proof in complete, extravagant detail and get them familiar with ''element chasing'' in set proofs for an intro to discrete class. I just got stuck and maybe I'm just too tired to see it.  Here's where I am so far. Notation: $A^c$ is the complement of $A$.  $A\backslash B$ means $A \cap B^c$. Prove that $A\setminus (B\setminus C) = (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C^c)$ for sets $A,\ B,\ C$ in some Universal Set $U$. Proof: ($\Leftarrow$) Let $x \in (A \backslash B) \cup (A\backslash C^c)$. This means that $x\in (A \cap B^c) \cup (A \cap C^{c^c})$. Simplifying, this means that $x \in (A \cap B^c) \cup (A \cap C)$. So $x\in (A \cap B^c)$ or $x\in (A\cap C)$. Now we have two cases. Case 1: $  x \in A \cap B^c.$ So $x \in A$ and $ x\in B^c$. Note: Now we must think outside the box a little bit.  We want to show that $x$ must be in $C$ but we don't have anything to do with $C$ in what we are able to derive from our assumptions.  We only have that $x$ is in $A$ and not in $B$.   This is where we must consider our problem.  We have the Universe $U$.  We know that $A,B,C$ are all in the universe.  So any point we chose in those sets must also be in $U$.   So think about this for a moment.  We don't know if our $x$ is in $C$ or not.  We need it to be in order to have the solution we are after.    So where is $x$ in relation  to $C$?   It's either in it or not in it.   So $x \in C$ or $x\in C^c$.  So we can examine each of these cases and we will find that if $x \in C^c$, we will get a contradiction. Case 1.a.  Suppose $x \in C$. Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B^c$ and $x \in C$. So $x \in A$ and $ x\in  (B^c \cap C)$. So $x \in A \cap (B^c \cap C)$. So $x \in A \cap (B \cap C^c)^c$. So $x \in A \cap (B\backslash C)^c$. So $x \in A \backslash (B \backslash C)$. Case 1.b.  Suppose $x \in C^c$. Then $x \in A$ and $x\in B^c$ and $x\in C^c$. So $x \in A \cap C^c$ and $x \in A\cap B^c$. Now I'm stuck.   I know that I need to develop a contradiction because $x$ cannot be in $C^c$, but I'm just not seeing it.  Any suggestions?   If I can see this one, I'll be able to see the similar method I need to develop for case 2: $x\in A \cap C$ where I need to examine whether $x \in B$ or $B^c$.","I'm working on this proof for some students I am tutoring and I've gotten a little stuck.   I want to show them how to do a proof in complete, extravagant detail and get them familiar with ''element chasing'' in set proofs for an intro to discrete class. I just got stuck and maybe I'm just too tired to see it.  Here's where I am so far. Notation: $A^c$ is the complement of $A$.  $A\backslash B$ means $A \cap B^c$. Prove that $A\setminus (B\setminus C) = (A\setminus B) \cup (A\setminus C^c)$ for sets $A,\ B,\ C$ in some Universal Set $U$. Proof: ($\Leftarrow$) Let $x \in (A \backslash B) \cup (A\backslash C^c)$. This means that $x\in (A \cap B^c) \cup (A \cap C^{c^c})$. Simplifying, this means that $x \in (A \cap B^c) \cup (A \cap C)$. So $x\in (A \cap B^c)$ or $x\in (A\cap C)$. Now we have two cases. Case 1: $  x \in A \cap B^c.$ So $x \in A$ and $ x\in B^c$. Note: Now we must think outside the box a little bit.  We want to show that $x$ must be in $C$ but we don't have anything to do with $C$ in what we are able to derive from our assumptions.  We only have that $x$ is in $A$ and not in $B$.   This is where we must consider our problem.  We have the Universe $U$.  We know that $A,B,C$ are all in the universe.  So any point we chose in those sets must also be in $U$.   So think about this for a moment.  We don't know if our $x$ is in $C$ or not.  We need it to be in order to have the solution we are after.    So where is $x$ in relation  to $C$?   It's either in it or not in it.   So $x \in C$ or $x\in C^c$.  So we can examine each of these cases and we will find that if $x \in C^c$, we will get a contradiction. Case 1.a.  Suppose $x \in C$. Then $x \in A$ and $x \in B^c$ and $x \in C$. So $x \in A$ and $ x\in  (B^c \cap C)$. So $x \in A \cap (B^c \cap C)$. So $x \in A \cap (B \cap C^c)^c$. So $x \in A \cap (B\backslash C)^c$. So $x \in A \backslash (B \backslash C)$. Case 1.b.  Suppose $x \in C^c$. Then $x \in A$ and $x\in B^c$ and $x\in C^c$. So $x \in A \cap C^c$ and $x \in A\cap B^c$. Now I'm stuck.   I know that I need to develop a contradiction because $x$ cannot be in $C^c$, but I'm just not seeing it.  Any suggestions?

I think the given answer is wrong. Let's suppose that the domain of x and y (students) is {Eric, John, Albin} and the domain of z (websites) is {A, B, C}. According to the answer, if, for example, Eric and Albin both visited only website A (which means that both of them did not visit website B and C), the statement ∃x∃y∀z((x≠y)∧(W(x,z)↔W(y,z))) should be true. Let's see if it's true... (Eric≠Albin)∧(W(Eric,A)↔W(Albin,A)) (Eric≠Albin)∧((W(Eric,A)→W(Albin,A))∧(W(Albin,A)→W(Eric,A))) Eric is not equal to Albin, so Eric≠Albin is true. Moving to the next, Since Eric visited website A, we have to test whether Albin also visited website A. Because I already assumed that Albin visited website A, the compound proposition ((W(Eric,A)→W(Albin,A)) is true. Next compound proposition (W(Albin,A)→W(Eric,A)) should also be true, so the statement will return True. However, what if Eric, Albin, and John did not visit any websites? If we express the compound proposition, if becomes: (I only wrote the case where x and y are not equal since the statment will definitely return false if x and y are equal due to ""x≠y"") Reminder: domain of x,y = {Eric, John, Albin}, domain of z = {A, B, C}. {(W(Eric,A)→W(John,A))∧(W(John,A)→W(Eric,A)) ∧ (W(Eric,B)→W(John,B))∧(W(John,B)→W(Eric,B)) ∧ (W(Eric,C)→W(John,C))∧(W(John,C)→W(Eric,C))} ∨ {(W(Eric,A)→W(Albin,A))∧(W(Albin,A)→W(Eric,A)) ∧ (W(Eric,B)→W(Albin,B))∧(W(Albin,B)→W(Eric,B)) ∧ (W(Eric,C)→W(Albin,C))∧(W(Albin,C)→W(Eric,C))}. Now, let's suppose that Eric, Albin, and John did not visit any websites. If the proposition means ""There are two different people who have visited exactly the same websites."", then the proposition should return FALSE since no one has visited any websites. Checking from the first row, (W(Eric,A)→W(John,A))∧(W(John,A)→W(Eric,A)) returns TRUE since Eric did not visit website A. Therefore, W(Eric,A)→W(John,A) is vacuously true.

In basic words, if we go till number 5, $\mathbb{N}_5$ then the height it reaches by summation is 5. Further, carrying on, we can get: The basic implication here is that we bump the numbers by specific $\mathbb{N}$ . At start, we take the beginning number, in our case it is 1, we move once up and then once down. Then we do it twice, thrice and so on. So 1 3 2 according to my diagram is one bump. At the ending $\mathbb{N}$ which is 2 here, we will jump it by 2 and make it low by 2. So it gets 2 5 12 7 4 .
