0,Understanding the Kummer extension of semi-abelian varieties,Understanding the Kummer extension of semi-abelian varieties,,"Currently, I am reading D. Bertrand's paper Galois representation and transcendental numbers ( here is the link to the paper), and I have a question about Theorem 2 (on Kummer theory of semi-abelian varieties). Theorem 2. Let $G = A \times L$ , and let $P$ be a point in $G(k)$ . For all prime numbers $\ell$ , the group $\chi_{(\ell)}(P)$ is commensurable with $T_\ell(G^o_P)$ , and coincides with $T_\ell(G^o_P)$ when $\ell$ is sufficiently large. The proof of Theorem 2 follows Ribet's method [60] (see also [37],[38]): since the representations $\rho_{(\ell)}$ , $\rho_\ell$ are semi-simple and satisfy Tate's conjecture [30], and in view of the finiteness or vanishing of the cohomology groups $H^1(\mathcal{G}_{(\ell)}, T_\ell(G))$ ([62], [21], [66]), one is reduced to showing that an endomorphism $\alpha$ of $G_P$ sends $P$ to a highly divisible point in $G_P(k)$ if and only if $\alpha$ itself is highly divisble in $\text{End}(G_P$ ; in practice, this will mean that $\alpha = 0$ . An effective version of this statement requires a precise description of the groups $G_P$ , and we return to this point in Theorem 8 below. He said: ""one is reduced to showing that ..."". I do not understand how to reduce the theorem to this claim. Do you have any hints or references? He also said that this Theorem can be proved using Ribet's method (in the paper Kummer theories on extensions of abelian varieties by tori, you can see the paper here ), but as I understand, in Ribet's paper, he proves claims involving almost all primes, while Theorem 2 involves every prime. Thank you. Edit: I have found a paper M .Hindry here where he sketches a proof of a more general result (appendix 2 in the paper).","Currently, I am reading D.

2,"Showing that a map $\operatorname{Div}(X) \to \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ is surjecitve (Gortz, Algebraic Geometry)","Showing that a map  is surjecitve (Gortz, Algebraic Geometry)","\operatorname{Div}(X) \to \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})","I'm reading the Gortz's Algebraic Geometry, proof of the Proposition 15.26 and stuck at understanding that some map appearing in the proposition is surjective. Let $X$ be an absolute curve ; i.e., a non-empty noetherian scheme with irreducible components $X_i$ ( $1\le i \le n$ ) satisfying following equivalent condtions (Gortz, Prop.15.1) (i) For every closed point $x \in X$ , $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,x} =1$ (ii) The closed irreducible subsets of $X$ are the $X_i$ and the closed points of $X$ . (iii) $\operatorname{dim}X_i = 1$ for all $i$ . Let $C^{1}$ be the set of points $x\in X$ such that $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}=1$ and let $j_x : \operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x} \to X $ be the canonical morphism of $x\in C^{1}$ . Note that $C^{1}$ is precisely the set of closed point of $X$ (If needed, I will upload detail). Then Gortz claims that next homomorphism of abelian groups : $$ \Psi : \operatorname{Div}(X) \to \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$$ $$ D \mapsto \Sigma_{x\in C^{1}}  j_{x}^{*}(D)$$ is isomorphism, where $\operatorname{Div}(X)$ is the Cartier divisors and $j_x^{*} : \operatorname{Div}(X) \to \operatorname{Div}(\operatorname{Spec} \mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ is the inverse image of cartier divisor (c.f. Gortz's book p.312) Note that $\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ since for $x \in C^{1}$ , $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a local noetherian ring of dimension $1$ . (His book Exercise 11.18) I don't know explicit isomorphism. I want to get explicit map, for later usage. Now, let $\mathcal{K}_X$ be the sheaf of total fractions( or called sheaf of meromorphic functions) of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ . For the surjectivity, he argues that To show that surjectivity we first recall that $\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}=\mathcal{K}_{X,x}$ and that $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{K}_X) = \operatorname{Frac}(\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_{X}))$ for every open affine subset $U$ of $X$ (Remark 11.23, $X$ is noetherian). Thus it suffices to show that for $f\in (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}$ there exists an open affine neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and $g \in (\operatorname{Frac}\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X))^{\times}$ such that $g_x = f$ and such that $g_y \in \mathcal{O}_{X,y}^{\times}$ for all $y\in U$ , $y\neq x$ . My question is, why the condition is sufficient for the surjectivity of the $\Psi$ ? My first attempt is, let $(\overline{f}_x)_{x\in C^{1}} \in \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})= \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}(\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}= \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}(\mathcal{K}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}  $ ( $f_x \in (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}$ ). Then by the above condition, for each $x\in C^{1}$ , there exists an open affine neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ and $g_x \in (\operatorname{Frac}\Gamma(U_x,\mathcal{O}_X))^{\times} = \Gamma(U_x, \mathcal{K}_X)^{\times}$ such that $(g_x)_{,x} = f_x$ and such that $(g_x)_{,y} \in \mathcal{O}_{X,y}^{\times}$ for all $y \in U_x$ with $y\neq x$ . I could show that $\{ U_x\}_{x\in C^{1}}$ forms an open cover of $X$ (If needed, I will upload proof). Now consider $D := (U_x , g_x)_{x\in C^{1}}$ . Then my question is, Q.1) $D \in \operatorname{Div}(X)$ ; i.e., $D$ forms a Cartier divisor on $X$ ? Q.2) $\Psi(D) = (j_x^{*}(D))_{x\in C^{1}} = (\overline{f}_x)_{x\in C^{1}} $ ? To show Q.2), fix $x_0 \in C^{1}$ . We need to show that $j_{x_0}^{*}(D) = \overline{f_{x_0}}$ . Note that $j_{x_0}^{*}(D) = j_{x_0}^{*}((U_x, g_x)_{x\in C^{1}})                           := (j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_x), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_x}(g_x))_{x\in C^{1}}                             = (j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0})) \in \operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0})  $ , where $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}} : \mathcal{K}_X \to j_{x_0,*}\mathcal{K}_{\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}}$ is an extension of $j_{x_0}^{\flat} : \mathcal{O}_X \to j_{x_0,*}\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}}$ and the final equality is true since $j_{x_0}$ is a homeomorphism onto the subspace which is the intersection of all open subsets of $X$ which contains $x_0$ (c.f.Gortz, p.69), so $j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0})$ forms an open cover of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ . I asked that what is an explicit isomorphism $\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ . My question about Q.2) is, upto this explicit isomorphism, $(j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}))$ sends to $\overline{(g_{x_0})_{,x_0}}$ ? If so, then since $(g_{x_0})_{,x_0} = f_{x_0}$ as above, maybe we are done. Furthur progress : Let $Y_0 : =\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}$ . Note that $\operatorname{DivCl}(Y_0) =0$ ( c.f. Gortz, p.318, Exercise 11.18-(a) ) ; i.e., every Cartier divisor on $Y_0$ is principal. So, there exists a homomorphism $ \eta : \operatorname{Div}(Y_0) \cong \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times})$ (c.f. Gortz, p.301, (11.11.2)) defined as follows : For every divisor $(Y_0, f) \in \operatorname{Div}(Y_0)$ , $\eta ( (Y_0, f)) : = f + \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times})  =f + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} $ . Now let's go back to the above question. Note that $(j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}))$ is a principal divisor on $Y_0$ . So it sends via $\eta$ to $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} \in \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times})$ . So, it suffices to show that upto isomorphism ( since $X$ is noetherian ; c.f. Gortz, p.301, Remark 11.23) $$\operatorname{Div}(Y_0) \cong \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}))^{\times}/ \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} \cong (\mathcal{K}_{X,x_0})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}  $$ , $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ sends to $(g_{x_0})_{,x_0} + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ . To sum it up, next question is true? Q. For the canonical map $j_x : Y:= \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}) \to X$ and an open (affine) neighborhood $U \ni x$ and $g \in \mathcal{K}_{X}(U)^{\times}$ , upto isomorphism : $$ \Gamma(j_x^{-1}(U),\mathcal{K}_{Y}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y}^{\times})  =\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{K}_{Y}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y}^{\times}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}))^{\times}/ \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times} \cong (\mathcal{K}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}  $$ , $\overline{j_{x}^{\flat}}_{,U}(g) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ sends to $g_{x} + \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ , where $g_x$ is the germ in $\mathcal{K}_{X,x}^{\times}$ at $x$ ?

5,Number of real roots of a separable real polynomial doesn't change under small perturbations,Number of real roots of a separable real polynomial doesn't change under small perturbations,,"Say we have a polynomial with real coefficients and no repeated roots.  Knowing that the roots of a polynomial vary continuously in the coefficients (so long as we don't change the degree), it seems intuitive that all sufficiently close polynomials will have the same number of real roots, because in order to make two real roots non-real, or vice versa, you'd have to first bring them together in order to satisfy the constraint that the non-real ones must be conjugates, and it's not too hard to see that all sufficiently close polynomials will also have no repeated roots (nonzero discriminant is an open set). However I'm at a loss as to how to formalize the ""you'd have to bring them together"" argument above.  That repeated roots can be avoided is easy because we have the discriminant as noted above, and looking at the sign of the discriminant shows the number of real roots won't change mod 4, but I'm not sure how to do better than that algebraically.  It would be nice if Sturm's Theorem could be used but I don't expect that the polynomial quotients involved would be continuous at all the relevant points.

Knowing that the roots of a polynomial vary continuously in the coefficients (so long as we don't change the degree), it seems intuitive that all sufficiently close polynomials will have the same number of real roots, because in order to make two real roots non-real, or vice versa, you'd have to first bring them together in order to satisfy the constraint that the non-real ones must be conjugates, and it's not too hard to see that all sufficiently close polynomials will also have no repeated roots (nonzero discriminant is an open set). However I'm at a loss as to how to formalize the ""you'd have to bring them together"" argument above.  That repeated roots can be avoided is easy because we have the discriminant as noted above, and looking at the sign of the discriminant shows the number of real roots won't change mod 4, but I'm not sure how to do better than that algebraically.  It would be nice if Sturm's Theorem could be used but I don't expect that the polynomial quotients involved would be continuous at all the relevant points.

Bear with, I am very new to algebraic geometry. To my understanding, $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\{3,2,1\}}$ is defined as the quotient of $\mathbb{C}^{3}\setminus{\{0\}}$ by the equivalence relation: $$ (z_{0},z_{1},z_{2})\sim(\lambda^{3}z_{0},\lambda^{2}z_{1},\lambda^{1}z_{2}) \text{ , with }\lambda\in\mathbb{C}^{*}\text{.} $$ As far as I understand, instead of having charts as in differential geometry, in algebraic geometry we look at ""coordinate patches"". The obvious guess (which clearly covers $\mathbb{P}_{\{3,2,1\}}$ ), is: \begin{align*} & U_{1} = \{ [1:z_{1}:z_{2}] | z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathbb{C} \} \\ & U_{2} = \{ [z_{0}:1:z_{2}] | z_{0},z_{2}\in\mathbb{C} \} \\ & U_{3} = \{ [z_{0}:z_{1}:1] | z_{0},z_{1}\in\mathbb{C} \} \\ \end{align*} where we have used square brackets to denote equivalence classes. Then as far as I understand, these patches are supposed to be isomorphic to (some quotient of?), affine $2$ -space, in the same way we would expect homeomorphisms with $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for manifolds. The obvious isomorphisms are: \begin{align*} & \phi_{1}:U_{1}\to\mathbb{A}^{2} \text{ , } [1:z_{1}:z_{2}] \mapsto (z_{1},z_{2}) \\ & \phi_{2}:U_{2}\to\mathbb{A}^{2} \text{ , } [z_{0}:1:z_{2}] \mapsto (z_{0},z_{2}) \\ & \phi_{3}:U_{3}\to\mathbb{A}^{2} \text{ , } [z_{0}:z_{1}:1] \mapsto (z_{0},z_{1}) \end{align*} with inverses: \begin{align*} & \phi_{1}^{-1}:\mathbb{A}^{2}\to U_{1} \text{ , } (x,y)\mapsto[1:x:y] \\ & \phi_{2}^{-1}:\mathbb{A}^{2}\to U_{2} \text{ , } (x,y)\mapsto[x:1:y] \\ & \phi_{2}^{-1}:\mathbb{A}^{2}\to U_{2} \text{ , } (x,y)\mapsto[x:y:1] \\ \end{align*} which are also locally given by polynomials.

To see this, note that for $\zeta_{n}$ an n'th root of unity, $[1:z_{1}:z_{2}]=[1:\zeta_{3}^{2}z_{1}:\zeta_{3}z_{2}]$ .

The unipotent subgroup of $P$ can then be seen to be of the form $$ U = \left\{ \left(\begin{array}{cc} \textrm{Id}_n & X\\ 0 & \textrm{Id}_n \end{array}\right) \in G\quad \middle|\quad X \in \textrm{Sym}_n(\mathbb{A}) \right\}, $$ where $\textrm{Sym}_n(\mathbb{A})$ denotes the additive group of $n \times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{R}$ , and $\textrm{Id}_n$ denotes the $n \times n$ identity matrix. We define the standard Levi component of $P$ to be: $$ M :=  \left\{ \left(\begin{array}{cc} Y & 0\\ 0 & u (Y^t)^{-1} \end{array}\right) \in G\quad \middle|\quad Y \in \textrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}),\ u \in \mathbb{A}^{\times} \right\}, $$ We define the standard maximal compact subgroup of $\textrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$ as: $$ K_{\infty} := \left\{ g \in \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})\ \middle|\ g \cdot i \textrm{Id}_n = i \textrm{Id}_n \right\}, $$ where the group action of $\textrm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$ is the usual one. Lastly, for any natural number $q$ , we define the following family of open subgroups of the $\textrm{GSp}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ : $$ K_p(q) := \left\{ g \in \textrm{GSp}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z}_p)\ \middle|\  g \equiv \left(\begin{array}{cc} \textrm{Id}_n & 0\\ 0 & a \textrm{Id}_n \end{array}\right)\quad (\textrm{mod}\ q),\quad\textrm{for some}\ a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times} \right\}, $$ and hence: $$ K_0(q) := \prod_p K_p(q), $$ with the product taken over the set of all rational primes $p$ . My question is whether or not we have the following ""Iwasawa decomposition"" of $G$ : $$ G = U M K_{\infty} K_0(q), $$ for any natural number $q$ . My reason for believing the above to be true is that it is a natural generalisation of a statement about $\textrm{GSp}_4(\mathbb{A})$ that certainly is true.

Because there are many different versions of this theorem, below the one I use. Let $V \subset \mathbb P^n$ be a smooth irreducible projective variety. Consider the set $W = \{ H \in \check{\mathbb P}^n \mid H \cap V \text{ is smooth}\}$ of all hyperplanes in $\mathbb P^n$ intersecting $V$ in a smooth variety. Then W is an open subvariety of $\check{\mathbb P}^n$ . That is, the set of hyperplanes having singular intersection with $V$ forms a Zariski-closed subset of $\check{\mathbb P}^n$ . (Here $\check{\mathbb P}^n$ denotes the dual of $\mathbb P^n$ and a hyperplane $H = \mathbb V\left(\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x_i\right) \subset \mathbb P^n$ corresponds to the point $[a_0:a_1:\cdots:a_n] \in \check{\mathbb P}^n$ .) An invitation to algebraic geometry by Smith, Kahanpää, Kekäläinen and Traves In other words, I want to prove that $\{ H \in \check{\mathbb P}^3 \mid H \cap V \text{ is singular} \}$ is closed. I want to do this by finding the equations that describe this set. My attempt below, inspired by the following statement in this post , Let $X \subset \mathbb P^n$ be a smooth irreducible projective variety. Let $H \subset \mathbb P^n$ be a hyperplane. The hyperplane section $H \cap X$ is smooth at $p$ if and only if the hyperplane $H$ is not tangent to $X$ at $p$ . So if $H = \mathbb V(ax + by + cz + dt)$ is a hyperplane, then $H \cap V$ is singular if and only if there exists some $p \in H \cap V$ such that $H$ is tangent to $X$ at $p$ . Since $H$ and $V$ are smooth, their tangent spaces are two-dimensional, and so $H$ is tangent to $X$ if these tangent spaces coincide.

Suppose that the fibers of $f$ are of dimension $\leq d$ . I would like to show that $$H^d(X,\mathcal{F})\to H^d(X,\mathcal{G})$$ is surjective, and here's what I've managed to prove so far. First off, let $\mathcal{K}$ be the kernel of the morphism $\mathcal{F}\to\mathcal{G}$ . Then $\mathcal{K}$ is quasicoherent.

In particular, $$R^pf_*\mathcal{K}=0,\ p\geq d+1.$$ In other words, for every open affine $V\subseteq S$ , we have $$(R^pf_*\mathcal{K})(V)=H^p(f^{-1}(V),\mathcal{K}|_{f^{-1}(V)})=0,\ p\geq d+1\tag{$\star$}.$$ Now, from the short exact sequence $$0\to \mathcal{K} \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G} \to 0$$ and quasicoherence of $\mathcal{G}$ , we obtain a long exact sequence in cohomology containing the following piece: $$H^d(X,\mathcal{F})\to H^d(X,\mathcal{G})\to H^{d+1}(X,\mathcal{K})$$ The surjectivity of the first arrow is equivalent to the vanishing of the last group, but is it possible to conclude that from $(\star)$ ?

We can prove that is an isomorphism if using weak Lefschetz theorem and the comparison theorem for topological fundamental group of and etale fundamental group of . Here we can use any embedding .

There do exist notions of higher etale homotopy groups which was first developed by Artin-Mazur. I have come to know that the first fundamental group computed in this theory does not match up with the Grothendieck's etale fundamental group but with the fundamental group defined in SGA3. There is an agreement when is a normal noetherian scheme.

In fact, let $f : T \rightarrow X$ (etale map) be a $X$ -torsor for some algebraic group $G$ . It gives a cohomology class on $H^{1}_{et}(X, G)$ . Now, I consider $g : X \rightarrow X$ be another etale map, and I look to $g^*(T) = T \times_X X$ , which is a $X$ -torsor (given by the second projection). First example : when we take $X=T=\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ , $f : T \rightarrow X$ given by $z \mapsto z^n$ , and $g : X \rightarrow X$ given by $z \mapsto z^m$ , with $\gcd(n,m)=1$ , some straighforward computations give that the map $g^* : H^{1}_{et}(X, G) \mapsto H^{1}_{et}(X, G)$ is the multiplication by $m$ . My problem : In general, we have that $g^*(T)= T \times_X X$ is a $X$ -torsor for the second projection, with group action of $G$ given by the action of the first coordinate. Now, let $(U_i \rightarrow X)_i$ be a family which trivialize the $X$ -torsor $T$ . Then, denoting $U_{ij} := U_i \times_X U_j$ , for $s_i \in U_i$ , $s_j \in U_j$ , there exists a unique $g_{ij} \in G(U_{ij})$ such that $s_j = g_{ij} s_i$ , and this is how we identify the $X$ -torsor $T$ to $[(g_{ij})_{ij}] \in H^{1}_{et}(X, G)$ . Now, let $U_i' := U_i \times_{X, g} X$ . Let $s_i : U_i \rightarrow T$ a section ( $s_i \in T(U_i)$ ). Then, if $(x_1, y_1) \in U_i \times_{X, g} X$ , we have that $f(s_i(x_1))= (U_i \rightarrow X)(x_1) = g(y_1)$ , and then we can construct a section $s'_i : U_i' \rightarrow g^*(T)$ by $(x_1, y_1) \mapsto (s_i(x_1), y_1)$ . It gives us an application $\pi_i : T(U_i) \rightarrow g^*(T)(U'_i)$ . As the action of $G$ on $g^*(T)$ is given by the action of $G$ on the first coordinate, the previous application is compatible with the action of $G$ , where the map $\text{res}_i : G(U_i) \rightarrow G(U'_i)$ is given by the ""restriction"" map (the composition with the projection $U_i' = U_i \times_{X, g} X \rightarrow U_i$ ). But then, if $s_j = s_i g_{ij}$ , we have $\pi_j(s_j) = \pi_i(s_i) \text{res}_{ij}(g_{ij})$ .

Ok so it suffices to show that the embedding $$\iota: (X\times Y) \cap \Delta \longrightarrow X\times Y $$ is ""a regular embedding of codimension $d$ "" in the sense that for every point $p\in (X\times Y) \cap \Delta$ , the kernel of the induced map of stalks $$ ker~\big(~\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y ,~ \iota(p)} \longrightarrow  \mathcal{O}_{(X\times Y) \cap \Delta, ~p}\big) $$ is generated by a ""regular sequence"" of length $d$ , $$\sigma_1,...,\sigma_d.$$ ""Regular sequence"" means that for $i=1,...,d$ , we have that $\sigma_i$ is not a zero-divisor of $$\mathcal{O}_{X\times Y ,~ \iota(p)}\big/(\sigma_1,...,\sigma_{i-1}). $$ Showing this ""regularity"" condition suffices because then it is also true that every $p\in X\times Y$ is contained in some open neighborhood $U\subset X\times Y$ such that $\Delta\cap U$ is cut out from $U$ by such a sequence, so that we can then apply Krull's PIT one element of the sequence at a time to show that each element cuts away exactly $1$ dimension from $U$ (recalling that $X\times Y$ and therefore $U$ is equidimensional since $X$ and $Y$ are equidimensional -- thanks to Alex Youcis for the proof of that.) OK MY QUESTION IS:  How do I find this regular sequence x_1,...,x_d at each point $p$ ? In algebraic terms, given radical ideals $I\subset k[x_1,...,x_n]=k[\overline x]$ , $J\subset k[y_1,...,y_n]=k[\overline y]$ (such that $V(I), V(J)$ are equidimensional), and a prime ideal $$\mathfrak p\subset k[\overline x]\otimes_k k[\overline y]\big/ (I\otimes k[\overline y]+ k[\overline x]\otimes J)$$ I need to somehow find a regular sequence of elements in $$\bigg(k[\overline x]\otimes_k k[\overline y]\big/ (I\otimes k[\overline y]+ k[\overline x]\otimes J)\bigg)_\frak p$$ that generates the ideal $(x_1-y_1,x_2-y_2,...,x_d-y_d)_\frak p$ . And another peripheral question that occurs to me just now: If we can complete the proof in this way, haven't we actually shown that the codimension of every component of $X\cap Y$ is exactly $codim_{\mathbb{A}_k^d}(X)+codim_{\mathbb{A}_k^d}(Y)$ ? After all, we covered $X\cap Y$ with open sets $W$ , each obtained by starting with $U$ , a pure $dim(X)+dim(Y)$ -dimensional variety, and cutting out $W$ with a regular sequence of length $d$ .  So isn't every such $W$ of pure dimension $dim(X)+dim(Y)-d$ ?

For a finite set of places $S$ of $k$ we can form the ring of $S$ -integers $O_{k,S}$ . Let $\mathbb{A}_k$ be the adéle ring of $k$ . For a $k$ -variety (or more generally any scheme over the spectrum of the adéles), I want to understand the set of adélic points $X(\mathbb{A}_k)$ . Everything I need is contained in Exercise  3.4. in Poonen's ""Rational points on varieties"", so I will present to you my struggles with it. The first part of the exercise says to find, for a $k$ -variety $X$ , a separated, finite-type scheme $\mathcal{X}$ over $O_{k,S}$ , for some $S$ , such that $\mathcal{X} \times_{O_{k,S}} k = X$ . I have constructed the scheme $\mathcal{X}$ by covering $X$ with spectra of finitely generated $k$ -algebras $k[x_1,\dots, x_{n_i}]/I_i$ and setting $S_i$ to be the set of places under which some coefficients of the polynomials in $I_i$ have negative valuation. (Note that this is finite because $I_i$ is finitely generated.) The ideal $I_i$ is then an ideal of the same polynomial ring considered with coefficients in the ring $O_{k,S_i}$ . We can now set $S= \bigcup S_i$ and glue these to get $\mathcal{X}$ over $O_{k,S}$ . One then sees that this becomes isomorphic to $X$ over $k$ ; by construction it is of finite type over $O_{k,S}$ . My problem now is to show that it is separated. My intuition tells me that this should be almost trivially true, because everything is so well behaved. I failed using the valuative criterion, but I have the following idea using Stacks 26.21.7 : Choose $p_i,p_j \in \mathcal{X}$ lying over $\mathfrak{p} \in \text{Spec }O_{k,S}$ . Let $A_i =\text{Spec }O_{k,S_i}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_i}]/I_i$ and $A_j = \text{Spec }O_{k,S_j}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_j}]/I_j$ be open affines around $p_i$ and $p_j$ , respectively. Then we can take the maximum $n_{ij}$ of $i,j$ and take $S_{ij}= S_i \cup S_j$ and $I_i, I_j$ to be ideals in a polynomial ring over $O_{k,S_{ij}}$ in $n_{ij}$ variables. The intersection $A_i \cap A_j$ should then be $\text{Spec }O_{k,S_{ij}}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_{ij}}]/(I_i + I_j)$ , hence affine. The natural map $$ O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_i) \otimes O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_j)\rightarrow O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_i\cap A_j)  $$ is an isomorphism, because $$ O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_i) \otimes O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_j) = \Gamma(A_i, O_{A_i}) \otimes \Gamma(A_j, O_{A_j}) = O_{k,S_{i}}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_{i}}]/I_i \otimes O_{k,S_{j}}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_{j}}]/I_j $$ and $$O_{\mathcal{X}}(A_i\cap A_j) = \Gamma(A_i\cap A_j, O_{A_i\cap A_j}) = O_{k,S_{ij}}[x_1,\dots, x_{n_{ij}}]/(I_i + I_j). $$ If this is correct, it would follow that $\mathcal{X}$ is separated.

One has to prove that $k[x,y]/(y-x^2)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable.
