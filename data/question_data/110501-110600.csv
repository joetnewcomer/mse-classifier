6,Subextension of a field with Galois series of subextensions of prime degree,Subextension of a field with Galois series of subextensions of prime degree,,"Let $p$ be a prime number, and $E/F$ be a field extension. Suppose $E/F$ has a finite series of subfields $$ F = E_0 < E_1 < \cdots < E_n = E $$ with $E_i / E_{i-1}$ Galois of degree $p$ for each $i$ . In this case, call $E/F$ special . Claim: If $K$ is an intermediate field of a special extension $E/F$ , then $K/F$ is also special. Things we know: $E/F$ has degree $p^n$ from multiplying the degrees of its subextensions, and so the degrees of $E/K$ and $K/F$ must also be $p$ -powers. $E/F$ is separable, since each extension $E_i / E_{i-1}$ is separable and separability is transitive. Then, $E/K$ and $K/F$ are also separable since transitivity also goes in the other direction. If in addition $K/F$ is normal, then the claim is very simple, since $K/F$ will then be Galois, and $\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$ is then a $p$ -group. We can construct a normal series of $p$ -index subgroups in the Galois group, and then use the correspondence to bring them back to the desired series of fields between $F$ and $K$ . But, $K/F$ will not be normal in general (I think). The order of its automorphism group must divide the degree of the extension, so $\mathrm{Aut}(K/F)$ must still be a $p$ -group.

13,Need help understanding the relation between Galois theory and a general quintic formula impossibility.,Need help understanding the relation between Galois theory and a general quintic formula impossibility.,,"Recently I have been studying a fair amount of Galois Theory and think I understand a lot of the ideas and theorems (at least intuitively) and how the things kind of come together and how Galois would have had motivation to look at certain topics. In particular I just finished looking at the Galois Correspondence theorem which provides us with a way to ""transform"" groups into fields and use one to understand problems in another. More specifically we have a correspondence between subgroups of $\text{Gal}(E/F)$ and intermediate fields of the Galois extension $E/F$. I want to understand (at least at a basic/intuitive level (I am not interested in getting bogged down in proofs yet I just want to straighten out the concepts involve and how they intertwine)) how this means that there is not a general forumla (using addition, subtraction, multiplication and nth roots) for polynomials of degree $5$ (I understand this can be extended to higher degrees but I'm not interested in that yet either.) I understand the reason for this is that there are $5$th degree polynomials whose Galois group is the whole of $S_5$ which is not a solvable group (since $A_5$ is not solvable and $A_5$ is the only intermediate normal subgroup of $S_5$). And we have a polynomial is solvable if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group. Hence for this reason we cannot find a general formula for quintics. There are several parts I don't understand about this and would be very appreciative if someone could clear these issues up for me so I can get more of an idea as to what is going on (as said I am less interested in proofs and rigour at the moment and want to get a feel for what is going on). I will try and summarise my main queries below: 1) What exactly is the relationship between the Galois group of a polynomial (the set of permutations of roots that will still satisfy any given polynomial that it satisfied before) and the $\text{Gal}(E/F)$? The correspondence talks about subgroups of $\text{Gal}(E/F)$ and subfields of $E/F$ and I understand we want to use the correspondence to switch from looking at a problem in fields to looking at the corresponding problem in group theory. But the relationship doesn't talk about the Galois group of a polynomial (presumably it does and the two ideas are linked I just don't see how). 2) How exactly is the Galois correspondence used to show there isn't forumlas for quintics? I outlined the rough argument as I understand it but it is not clear at all to me when it is applied. 3) When we talk about quintics having no formula are we talking about quintics with rational coefficients, real coefficients, complex coefficients or all of them? 4) What exactly is meant by the definition of the Galois group of a polynomial? (We can shift roots and some equations won't notice we've done anything) which equations are we talking about? I see $x^2-2$ can't tell if we switch $\sqrt2 \mapsto -\sqrt2$ for instance. 5) We want to show there is a polynomial whose Galois group is $S_5$. To me this means we want to find a polynomial with roots that we can move around as much as possible. I know there is a theorem that says there is no formula (i.e. solutions in radicals) if the Galois group is not solvable like $S_5$ but why is this the case what is so special about the fact we can move around the roots so much and nothing is effected (presumably this has something to do with the Galois correspondence)? I think that is all I can think of asking for now. I have tried my best to make it clear as to where my understanding is letting me down. It's like I have all these pieces of information that I understand separately but I'm missing something very very important to see the bigger picture and bring everything together.
