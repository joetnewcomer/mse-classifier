I've noticed that in my lecture notes and in the book I'm reading, I can never find a general recipe, but surely there must be guidelines. There are three cases (I think): Show $b$ is the supremum of $A$ when $A =[a,b]$ or $A=(a,b]$ Show $b$ is the supremum of $A$ when $A=[a,b)$ or $A = (a,b)$ Show $b$ is the supremum of $A$ when $A$ is a set described by a given property, for example $A = \{n\in \mathbb{N}\,\,\,\,\, | \,\,\,\,\,\,(-1)^nn^2\}$ (I've made this up). For example I show there is a general recipe for case 1: Case 1 Since we are looking for the supremum, it doesn't really matter whether it is $A =[a,b]$ or $A=(a,b]$ , so I'll just use $A=(a,b]$. By definition of the set, we know that $b \geq x$, $\forall x\in A$. Now suppose there exists another element $c$ such that $c\geq x$, $\forall x \in A$, then since $b\in A$ we have that $b \leq c$ and hence $b = \sup(A)$. Case 3 Well here the general recipe is very general, meaning that it depends a lot on the description of the set. However one can generalise saying that first of all, if possible, we should try to rewrite the expression giving us the elements of the set. After this, we should start from remembering that $n\in\mathbb{N}$ means that $n \geq 1$ or $n>0$. Similarly, we can use domains and properties of several functions, such as $-1\leq \cos(x) \leq 1$. We use these inequalities to try to bound the expression describing the elements of $A$. Once we have found that, we are basically either in case $1$ or in case $2$. Sometimes, we might have to use induction, but that is rare. Should we use approximation property for suprema? Case 2 Is there a general recipe? I always make these exercises quite...luckily, although I can feel there is some kind of underlying structure. Most of the times I used Archimedean properties, if not all the times.

6,Proof of basis for a box topology,Proof of basis for a box topology,,"Theorem: Suppose the topology on each space $X_{\alpha}$ is given by a basis $\mathcal{B}_{\alpha}$. The collection of all sets of the form $$\prod_{\alpha \in J} B_{\alpha}$$ where $B_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}$ for each ${\alpha}$, forms a basis for the box topology on $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$ My Attempted Proof The topological space we are dealing with here is $\left(\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}, \mathcal{T}_B\right)$, where $\mathcal{T}_B$ is the box topology on  $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$. Let $\mathcal{B}_{\text{box}}$ denote the standard basis for the box topology. Put $$\mathcal{F} = \left\{ \ \prod_{\alpha \in H} B_{\alpha} \ \middle| \ B_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{B}_{\alpha} \ \text{for each $\alpha$} \ \right\}.$$ Then take $U \in \mathcal{T}_B$, and take $x \in U$. Since $U = \bigcup_{ B \in \mathcal{K}}B$ where $B = \prod_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha}$ and $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$ and $\mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{B}_{\text{box}}$ we then have $x \in B$ for some $B \in \mathcal{K}$. In other words $x \in \prod_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha}$ for some indexing set $J$. Now since each $U_{\alpha}$ is open in $X_{\alpha}$, we have $U_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\gamma \in I}B_{\gamma}$ where $B_{\gamma}$ are basis elements of $X_{\alpha}$. Therefore $$x \in \prod_{\alpha \in J}\left(\bigcup_{\gamma \in I}B_{\gamma}\right)_{\alpha}$$ By elementary set theory we have $$\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} V_i\right) \times \left(\bigcup_{j \in J} W_j\right) = \bigcup_{\langle i, j \rangle I \times J}\left(V_i \times W_j\right)$$ So that $$\prod_{\alpha \in J}\left(\bigcup_{\gamma}B_{\gamma}\right)_{\alpha} \  = \  \bigcup_{\langle i_1, i_2, ... \rangle \in I_1 \times I_2 \times ...} \underbrace{\left(B_{i_1} \times B_{i_2} \times  ...\right)}_{|J| \ \text{times}}$$ Choose $H = I_1 \times I_2 \times I_3 \times ...$ Then $\exists \prod_{\alpha \in H}B_{\alpha} \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x \in \prod_{\alpha \in H}B_{\alpha}$. It also follows that $$\prod_{\alpha \in J}\left(\bigcup_{\gamma}B_{\gamma}\right)_{\alpha} \subset U$$ Since $\prod_{\alpha \in J}\left(\bigcup_{\gamma}B_{\gamma}\right)_{\alpha} = \prod_{\alpha \in J}U_{\alpha} = B \subset U$. Thus it follows that $\mathcal{F}$ is a basis for the box topology on $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_{\alpha}$. $\square$ Is my above proof correct and rigorous? Are there areas of it that I can improve on? Can this be proved in an easier way?

I'm not able to figure out where is the error: First let's define what a computable number is: a number is computable if there is a Turing Machine that can return the decimal expansion of that number with arbitrary precision. 1) Rational are computable by a Turing Machine. Since all rational can be written by definition like a quotient of two integers: n/m, for any rational there must exist an algorithm that compute that number. We call this type of Turing Machine: ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"".  It is important to note that even if I'm not able to see how to construct the Turing Machine for example the rational: ""a² < 2"". This Turing Machine must exist by definition. 2) Dedekind cuts are defined with 2 rationals. 3) The pair of rationals that defines the Dedekind cut can be computed with 2 Turing Machines. From my point of view this 2 Turing Machines describes completely the Dedekind cut since the are able to compute the 2 rational numbers with arbitrary precision. 4) The number of Turing Machines is countable and the number of two Turing Machines is also countable since it is equivalent of the claim that ordered pairs of natural numbers are countable. Lets ""choice"" a pair of ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"" Turing Machines that validates the property of expressing a Dedekind cut: for example the TM that computes the rational a² < 2 and the TM that computes the rational b² > 2 for the square root of 2. It is important to note that even if this property between the two Turing Machines can not be verified this pair must exist since The two Turing Machine exist. (this is a non constructive argument and I think that we must invoke the axiom of choice to be able to talk about this pair). We can construct a Turing Machine called ""ArbitraryPrecisionRealNumber made of this pair of ""ArbitraryPrecisionQNumber"" that compute any real number defined with a Dedekind cut. In essence we can say: ""this construction of a Turing Machine is a description of the real number defined by the Dedekind Cut"". The problem with this sentence is evident since we have: 1) the set of Dedekind cuts forms a bijection with the set of reals. 2) there are as many Dedekind cuts as reals. So the set of Dedekind cuts are uncountable. So we have a set of countable Turing Machine of every Dedekind cut but the set of Dedekind cut is uncountable. I think that this also can be restated in the following manner: There are uncomputable reals but all Dedekind cut can be computed. UPDATE: I think all the problem comes from this point: ""Dedekind cuts are defined with 2 rationals"" I will elaborate a little bit more my thoughts. It is true that from an ""absolute perspective"" Dedekind Cut can not be defined by 2 rationals. One good argument for this is that a rational set does not have a supremum for example so you are not able to define a Turing Machine that compute this (non-existent) number. I was more concerned with an ""infinite approximation"" perspective of a real. In my opinion if we define a process that can define in the limit a real number (at infinity) then it is a definition of a real number So in fact we could restate all this question like this: ""Could we define 2 Turing Machines that approximates from above and from bellow to the infinity a real number?"" If we can, then I think the conclusion that I gave is correct and this two TM would be equivalent to Dedekind Cuts. I had doubts if this could be possible but if the real number is no definable in a finite way then this two Turing Machines does not exist by definition.

I also do not know how to format the math symbols here, so forgive me if I'm a bit vague. Given a set of numbers S1 = [0, 1], we can say that there are an infinite amount of numbers in that set. If the previous statement, some infinities are larger than others is true then we can also say some infinities are smaller than others and also some infinities are equal in size to others . With this in mind, we could say that if S2 = [1, 2], then there are just as many numbers as there are in S1, as there are in S2, because the range is the same. If both of the previous statements are true, than we could define S3 = S1 + S2, which would yield all numbers in the set [0, 2], and we could say that S3 is larger than both S1 and S2, since it contains all numbers in S1 and S2.

Now for these two assertions: If $x>2$ then $x>3$.($x$ is understood to be a real number). For every $n$ if $n>2$ then $n>3$. Is the $x$ in the first assertion free while the $n$ in the second assertion bound ? The Handbook of Mathematical Discourse states that in the first assertion $x$ is actually universally quantified like the second assertion. Can someone elaborate on that ? Also, when proving them, their proofs are exactly the same except in the second one we add ""let n be arbitrary""(How to Prove it). So do the two assertions differ in their Logical structure ?

Is the usage of the and a different in mathematical definitions(sorry for the poor example above, if you have any better example that would be appreciated). Also aren't mathematical definitions assertions ? A number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. Every number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. I know that a definition is NOT an assertion and thus cannot be true or false(Right ?). The definition just describes a property(ies) of some mathematical object.

Also the second definition can be expressed as $\forall n (n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$. Doesn't that mean that a definition in a sense is true or false since it can be expressed by a logical symbols ? Another definition : Suppose $n$ is an integer.

But the assertion $\forall x(x>2)$ is false. In the first case $x$ is free while in the second case $x$ is a bound variable. Now for these two assertions: If $x>2$ then $x>3$.($x$ is understood to be a real number). For every $n$ if $n>2$ then $n>3$. Is the $x$ in the first assertion free while the $n$ in the second assertion bound ? The Handbook of Mathematical Discourse states that in the first assertion $x$ is actually universally quantified like the second assertion. Can someone elaborate on that ? Also, when proving them, their proofs are exactly the same except in the second one we add ""let n be arbitrary""(How to Prove it). So do the two assertions differ in their Logical structure ? Now for definitions : A number is even if it is divisible by $2$. The number is even if it is divisible  by $2$. Is the usage of the and a different in mathematical definitions(sorry for the poor example above, if you have any better example that would be appreciated). Also aren't mathematical definitions assertions ? A number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. Every number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. I know that a definition is NOT an assertion and thus cannot be true or false(Right ?). The definition just describes a property(ies) of some mathematical object. Now for the above two definitons is $n$ a free variable in the first but bound variable in the second ? Also the second definition can be expressed as $\forall n (n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$. Doesn't that mean that a definition in a sense is true or false since it can be expressed by a logical symbols ? Another definition : Suppose $n$ is an integer. Then $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. Where is the location of Suppose $n$ is an integer (a precondition) in the logical structure of a definition(after or before the biarrow) ? $\forall n (n\ is\ an\ integer \rightarrow n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ or $\forall n (n\ is\ an\ integer \land n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ or $\forall n ( n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ an\ integer \land n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ Also when trying to prove ""$x$ is even"" what exactly should I do ? Another definition : Suppose $R$ is a partial order on a set $A$, $B ⊆ A$, and$ b ∈ B$. Then$ b$ is called an $R$-smallest element of B (or just a smallest element if $R$ is clear from the context) if $∀x ∈ B(bRx)$. How do I express this definiton in logical symbols(are $A$,$b$,$B$, $R$ free or bound?)?What should I do if I want to prove that $z$ is a $H$ smallest element of $M$ ?

Here is my attempt at a proof which excludes arithmetic, ordering or cardinality : I would appreciate feedback on its correctness. Summary of natural numbers and the principle of mathematical induction (PMI) in ZF: define the successor of a set X as $X^+ = X \cup$ {$X$}.

Thanks. Proposition : Let $Y$ be a set and let $f: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow Y$ be a function. Then $f[\mathbb{N}]$ is at most countable. Proof: If $Y$ is finite the result follows, this is because$f[\mathbb{N}]\subset Y$ and any subset of a finite set  is finite and has at most the size of the set in which is contained. We may assume  that the set $Y$ is infinite. We set $A:= \{\,n\in\mathbb{N}:f(i)\not=f(n) \,\,\text{ for  any }i< n\, \}$. And we define the function $g:A \rightarrow f[\mathbb{N}]$ as the restriction of $f$ in $A$. We claim that the function $g$ is a bijective map. From the definition of $A$ we already know that the map is $1:1$. We will show that also is onto. Let $y\in f[\mathbb{N}]$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is no $n\in A$ such that $g(n)=y$. Since $y$ lies in the image of $f$, then there is some $j\in \mathbb{N}$ for which $y=f(j)$.

Then $f(m)\not=f(n)$ for any $n<m$ and thus $\,m\in A$ but $g(m)=f(m)= f(j)=y$. Thus any case leads to a contradiction. The result follows by reductio ad absurdum. Hence $f$ is surjective and injective, i.e., a bijective map. Since there is a bijection between $A$ and the images of the natural numbers under $f$, both have the same cardinality.

Then, $S_4(n) = \{n_k \in \mathbb{Z} : n_k = 4q+(r+k), k \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}\subset \mathbb{Z}\}$. First we prove injectivity. For some $n_i, n_j \in S_4(n)$  consider $f(n_i) = f(n_j)$. But $n_i = 4q+(r+i)$ and $n_j = 4q + (r+j)$, and so $f(n_i) = r+ i$ and $f(n_j) = r+j$ and in that case we have $i = j$ implying that $n_i = n_j$ and thus $f$ is injective. To prove surjectivity we do as follows: given $a \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ we want $n_k = 4q+(r+k)$ such that $f(n_k) = a$. But this means $r+k = a$ and so we simply take $k = a - r$ which is the same as taking $n_{a -r}$, so that we have $f(n_{a-r}) = r+(a-r)=a$ as desired, so that $f$ is surjective. Is this proof correct? I think there's just a problem. First, I didn't prove that if $r$ is the remainder of $n$ by $4$ then $r+1$ is the remainder of $n+1$ by $4$. Second, I didn't prove that $a - r \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ which is necessary so that $n_{a-r} \in S_n(4)$. Are those real problems with this proof? Are any other errors there?

Also, if I wanted to prove that indeed $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite, the only option I see is by making a proof by induction. In such a case then my statement should be false. I don't know... Edit : The approach to prove that there is a biyection is the same way as to proove that it's a function: It's injective: It's vacously true that $\forall a\in \mathbb{N}\forall b\in \emptyset((a,b)\in f \wedge(c,b)\in f\Longrightarrow a=c)$. It's surjective: It's vacuously true that $\forall a\in \emptyset \exists b((a,b)\in f)$. Now I know my problems are in my understanding of the meaning of ""vacously"". It would be very nice if you guys could tell me the mistakes in it and also in my definitions.","Intuitively the answer is yes. According to the definition, a set $A$ is infinite if there is no bijection between $A$ and some natural number. Now, I don't know the problem of my reasoning.

(Hint assume X is finite and derive a contradition) $''\le''$ means here less than or equinumerous with Proof: (I am a beginner in the set theory)... Assume X is finite, i.e $\exists f:n\to X$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ which is bijective and then $\exists f^{-1}:X\to n$ which is also bijective.  By the hypothesis $\mathbb{N}\le X$ which means that $\exists g:\mathbb{N}\to X$ which is injective. But how to derive a contradition now?
