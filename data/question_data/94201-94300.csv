At first, it seems we need to have $c\geq 0$ but as I will point out below, any $c\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathop{\rm Ai}(c) \neq 0$ will give the same result. The integral can be solved using the antiderivative $ \frac{\pi\mathop{\rm Bi}(z)}{\mathop{\rm Ai}(z)}$ together with the well-known asymptotic expansion for Ai and Bi as I pointed out in the answer to the question. All the zeros of the Airy function lie on the negative real axis.  The curious fact why the above mentioned result holds for almost all $c$ is that all the residues at the corresponding poles of $\mathop{\rm Ai}^{-2}(z)$ vanish.

18,Close zeros of analytic functions,Close zeros of analytic functions,,"If an analytic function $f(z)$ has two zeros which are close together, there is a zero of $f^\prime(z)$ which is nearby.  This is clear if $f(z)$ is a quadratic polynomial, and intuitive in general from the Hadamard product: $f(z)$ is a quadratic polynomial times a function which is nearly constant in the neighborhood of the zeros. How rigorous can we make this statement? Without loss of generality, we can translate so the origin is the midpoint of the two zeros, rotate so they are both real, and dilate so the zeros are $\pm1$, so $f(z)=(1-z^2)g(z)$, with (suppose) $g(z)\ne0$ on $|z|<1$.  Thus $\log(g(z))$ is well defined on the disk, and we can write $g(z)=\exp(h(z))$ with analytic $h(z)$. Thus we seek $z$ (hopefully in $|z|<1$) satisfying $-2z+(1-z^2)h^\prime(z)=0$. Edit :  Based on robjohn's comment, we need to quantify the heuristic above that the 'remainder' of the Hadamard product is roughly constant near the zeros.  Thus assume also that $g^\prime(0)$ is 'small', where the proposed solution below makes this precise.","If an analytic function $f(z)$ has two zeros which are close together, there is a zero of $f^\prime(z)$ which is nearby.

20,Cycles around compacta and the global Cauchy theorem,Cycles around compacta and the global Cauchy theorem,,"Recall the global Cauchy theorem/formula: Let $U$ be open and $\Gamma\subset U$ a cycle . If $\Gamma$ is homologous to zero in $U$ , then for all $f:U\to\Bbb C$ holomorphic and $w\in U\setminus\Gamma$ holds $$n(\Gamma,w)f(w)=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\Gamma\frac{f(z)}{z-w}\mathrm dz.$$ Note that ""cycle"" means two things in the book I'm following (Falko Lorenz's ""Funktionentheorie""): initially, it was defined as a chain (finite formal $\Bbb Z$ -sum) of closed integration paths (and that's how it's usually defined in formulations of the global Cauchy theorem), then the definition was expanded to mean a closed chain of integration paths, i.e. one with trivial boundary. It's not hard to see that any closed chain $\Gamma$ can be rejigged into a chain of closed paths $\Gamma'$ such that $\int_\Gamma f=\int_{\Gamma'}f$ for all $f$ (e.g. if $\Gamma=\gamma+\overline\gamma$ , where $\overline\gamma$ is the reverse path, then we might take $\Gamma'=\gamma*\overline\gamma$ ), so it doesn't really matter which definition is used. I am trying to understand the proof of the following proposition Theorem: Let $U$ be open and $K\subset U$ compact and non-empty. There exists a cycle $\Gamma\subset U\setminus K$ such that for all $f:U\to\Bbb C$ hoolomorphic and $w\in K$ holds $$f(w)=\frac1{2\pi i}\int_\Gamma\frac{f(z)}{z-w}\mathrm dz,$$ i.e. there is a cycle in $U\setminus K$ such that the Cauchy formula holds for it on $K$ . This is a weaker version of the statement that we can always find a cycle $\Gamma\subset U\setminus K$ that is homologous to zero in $U$ and winds around $K$ once (a proof can be found e.g. here , on page 160). The proof of the above theorem runs roughly as follows Pave the plane with $\varepsilon(\Bbb Z+i\Bbb Z)$ and let $Q_1,\dots,Q_n$ be the finitely many squares of the lattice intersecting $K$ ; by making $\varepsilon$ small enough we can ensure that $Q_i$ are all contained in $U$ . Let $$\delta_i=\gamma_{i1}+\gamma_{i2}+\gamma_{i3}+\gamma_{i4}$$ be the positively oriented boundary of $Q_i$ , let $\Lambda=\sum_i\delta_i$ , and let $\Gamma$ be the sum of those sides $\gamma_j$ that belong to only one $Q_i$ , then $\Gamma$ is a cycle in $U\setminus K$ and $\int_\Gamma f=\int_\Lambda f$ for all $f\in H(U)$ . We then show that the formula holds for $z\in K$ not lying on $\Lambda$ and extend it to all of $K$ by continuity, since both sides of the identity are analytic. I am trying to understand the highlighted part, namely why $\Gamma$ is a cycle (in either sense of the word) and why it must be contained in $U\setminus K$ (if a side of $Q_i$ does not belong to any other square, why should it not intersect $K$ ?).

25,Contradiction in simple complex integral: should this pole contribute?,Contradiction in simple complex integral: should this pole contribute?,,"This is a follow-up question to a post I made on Physics SE . TLDR; Essentially I have derived an apparent contradiction, starting from a simple integral. It feels like I'm missing something quite elementary and trivial, but I cannot seem to resolve it. Consider the following integral, whose approximate form is commonly finds in physics . $$f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{dz}{\left(-z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon\right )^2 \left(-(z-x)^2+ M^2 -i \epsilon\right)} \tag{1}$$ $m,M>0$ are positive real numbers, $x$ is a positive real number (which we may allow to be complex), and $\epsilon>0$ is an infinitesimal small number which shifts the poles away from the real axis. In the complex $z$ plane, the integral looks as follows: The blue dots correspond to the double-poles at $z=\pm (m - i\epsilon)$ , and red dots correspond to the single-poles at $z=x\pm (M-i\epsilon )$ . The green line represents the integration contour. Notice that the pole at $z=x-M+i\epsilon$ resides in the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ quadrant. Now let's apply the technique of Feynman parameterization , which combines both the rational terms in the integrand into a single rational function. $$\begin{align} f(x)&=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \frac{2!}{\left[   (1-u_1-u_2)\left( -(z-x)^2+ M^2 -i \epsilon \right)+u_2 \left( -z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon\right) +u_3 \left( -z^2 + m^2 - i\epsilon \right) \right]^3} \\ &= \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \frac{2}{\left[-(z-(1-u_1-u_2)x)^2-(u_1+u_2)(1-u_1-u_2)x^2+(1-u_1-u_2)M^2+(u_1+u_2)m^2-i\epsilon\right]^3} \\ &= \int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dz \frac{2}{\left[-z^2+g(u_1,u_2,x)^2-i\epsilon\right]^3} \tag{2} \end{align}$$ In the final expression above, note that no matter if $g^2$ is positive or negative, the triple-poles will always lie in the $2^{\textrm{nd}}$ and $4^{\textrm{th}}$ quadrants. Since no poles $1^{\textrm{st}}$ and $3^{\textrm{rd}}$ quadrants, we may rotate the contour counter-clockwise by $90^\circ$ , also known as Wick-Rotation . We now have the following expression: $$f(x)=\int_0^1 du_1 \int_0^{1-u_1} du_2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} i dz \, \frac{1}{\left[z^2+g(u_1,u_2,x)^2 -i\epsilon\right]^3} \tag{3}$$ Let's now reverse all the previous algebraic steps, but using the Wick-rotated expression. This will finally give us (compare with (1)): $$f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{d(iz)}{\left(z^2 + m^2 -i\epsilon\right )^2 \left(-(iz-x)^2+ M^2 -i\epsilon\right)} \tag{4}$$ But this is none other than the Wick-rotated version of the original integral! This is explicitly telling us that: $$\int_{\Gamma_1} I(z) dz= \int_{\Gamma_2} I(z) dz \tag{5}$$ where $\Gamma_1$ is the contour along the real axis, $\Gamma_2$ is the contour along the imaginary axis, and $I(z)$ is the integrand in (1). Note that this is expression was derived by @QMechanic in the PSE post mentioned previously . The essence of this derivation is found in most introductory textbooks on Quantum Field Theory. On the other hand, if we tried to smoothly rotate the original contour by $90^\circ$ , we would unavoidably pick up the residue of the pole in the $1^{\textrm{st}}$ contour. $$\int_{\Gamma_1} I(z) dz= 2\pi i \,\textrm{Res} \left(I(z);z=x-M-i\epsilon \right)+ \int_{\Gamma_2} I(z) dz \tag{6}$$ Below you can see an illustration of this intuitive equation. Combining (5) and (6), we see that the residue must be zero. But we can calculate this residue and show it isn't zero, a contradiction! $$\textrm{Res} \left(I(z);z=x-M-i\epsilon \right)=\frac{1}{2M\left(-(x-M)^2+m^2\right)}\overset{?}{\neq} 0 \tag{7}$$ So what's going on here? How can I resolve this contradiction? Edit 1: A possible resolution. I've just realized an issue in the algebraic steps. In (2), as per @Maxim's comment, I shifted $z\rightarrow z+(1-u_1-u_2)x$ in order to remove the term linear in $z$ . This was fine, since $x$ was real-valued. However when reversing these steps later, going from (3) to (4), the equivalent shift would be $z\rightarrow z+i(1-u_2-u_2)x$ . This is not valid since for arbitrary $x$ the shift may hop over one of the poles! The resulting shifted-contour would not be homotopic to the original one! For it to be valid we would need $x$ to be imaginary. If we have analytic continuation in mind, we could simply assume at this step that $x$ is actually purely imaginary. But then our original shift $z\rightarrow z+(1-u_1-u_2)x$ would not be valid for the same reason!","This is a follow-up question to a post I made on Physics SE . TLDR; Essentially I have derived an apparent contradiction, starting from a simple integral. It feels like I'm missing something quite elementary and trivial, but I cannot seem to resolve it. Consider the following integral, whose approximate form is commonly finds in physics . are positive real numbers, is a positive real number (which we may allow to be complex), and is an infinitesimal small number which shifts the poles away from the real axis. In the complex plane, the integral looks as follows: The blue dots correspond to the double-poles at , and red dots correspond to the single-poles at . The green line represents the integration contour. Notice that the pole at resides in the quadrant. Now let's apply the technique of Feynman parameterization , which combines both the rational terms in the integrand into a single rational function. In the final expression above, note that no matter if is positive or negative, the triple-poles will always lie in the and quadrants. Since no poles and quadrants, we may rotate the contour counter-clockwise by , also known as Wick-Rotation . We now have the following expression: Let's now reverse all the previous algebraic steps, but using the Wick-rotated expression. This will finally give us (compare with (1)): But this is none other than the Wick-rotated version of the original integral!

I'm reading through Miranda's ""Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces,"" and getting caught up on one point from Chapter VI. First, some background: a divisor $D$ is called very ample on compact Riemann Surface $X$ if a) its associated embedding of $X$ into projective space is a holomorphic embedding whose image is a Riemann Surface and b) its linear system $|D|$ is base point-free. It is a theorem that this happens if and only if $\dim L(D - q - p) = \dim L(D) - 2$ for all points $p, q \in X$ (including the case $p = q$ ), where $L(D)$ is the set of meromorphic functions on $X$ such whose principal divisors (divisors given by orders of points) are $\geq - D$ . Claim : a very ample divisor $D$ must have the property that the field generated by $L(D)$ separates points and tangents on $X$ . That is, given distinct $p, q \in X$ , there is a meromorphic function on $X$ in the field generated by $L(D)$ separating them (separates points), and, given any $p \in X$ , there must be a meromorphic function on $X$ in that same field whose multiplicity at $p$ is one, which means there is a meromorphic function $f$ on $X$ (in the field generated by $L(D)$ ) which is either a) holomorphic at $p$ with the order of $f - f(p)$ equal to one at $p$ , or b) which has a simple pole at $p$ (separates tangents). What I know : the very ample condition implies $$L(D - p - q) \subset L(D - p) \subset L(D)$$ is a strict chain of subspaces for any $p, q \in X$ , which means, for example, there is a function $f$ in $L(D - p)$ not in $L(D - p - q)$ . This function would satisfy the property that $ord_p(f) \geq -D(p) + 1$ , but that there is some point $x$ in its support where $ord_x(f) < -D(x)$ , but I am lost after that. I have begun to slowly get lost in the concepts over this past chapter, and would appreciate some help here. For reference, this claim is made on page 170, and is problem A on p 178.

64,"How do find the numerical average of $x^x$ from $(-4,-2)$ without x-values that give a complex output?",How do find the numerical average of  from  without x-values that give a complex output?,"x^x (-4,-2)","I wanted to find the approximate average of all real points in $(x)^{x}$ from $[-4,-2]$. This means I am ignoring all real inputs that give a complex output and need average to be a real number. To first solve this I found the following defined sets of $x^x$ when $x<0$. $$x=-\frac{2m}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ $$x=-\frac{2m+1}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ Each of the sets coincides with another equation so I got the following peice-wise definition. $$x^x=\begin{cases} (-x)^x & x=\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\\ -\left(-x\right)^{x} & x=\left\{ -{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\ \\ \text{undefined} & x\neq\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\bigcup-{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\} \end{cases} $$ Then I took the limit definition of an integral along with $\frac{1}{b-a}$ to determine the average. $$\frac{1}{b-a}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(a+\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)$$ where $f(x)=x^x$ (Note that it is possible to skip $x$-values that given an undefined output in an interval. An example is $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$) When $n\in\left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ there are numbers whose outputs coincide with $(-x)^{x}$ and numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$. So I took the probabilty of having numbers whose ouputs coincide with ($(-x)^x$ vs a numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$ in $[-4,-2]$. I got $\frac{1}{2}$ for both of them. Thus I found when $n \in \left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ as $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{(-2)-(-4)}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{(-x)}^{x}+\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}-{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\right)=0$$ But when $n$ is odd, all numbers in the interval have outputs coinciding only with $(-x)^{x}$. So when $n$ is odd integer and $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{-2+4}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\approx.062152$$ I have two different numbers depending on which $n$value I choose. So does this mean the average does not exist? If not how could one find the average? What other methods can be used to find a real number average? EDIT Analyzing this I believe that one should choose specific $n's$ despite a limit having to accept all $n's$ I presume that an interval of reimmmen sum interval should be as dense as possible and represent all defined numbers. This leads me to believe the average is 0. Since this goes against the definition of a limit, I think the definition of a reimmen sum should be slightly altered for dense defined inputs with undefined outputs. For example I believe intervals with numerator increase of $1$ in $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$ can would give an accurate average compared to an numerator increase of $2$ in $\{-12/3,-10/3,-8/3,-6/3\}$. When there is numerator increase of $1$ I end up with zero. Since it represents inputs whose output coincide with both $(-x)^x$ and $-(-x)^{x}$ the average should be zero. Perhaps my reasoning is correct but I would like to find out if this is the case.","I wanted to find the approximate average of all real points in $(x)^{x}$ from $[-4,-2]$. This means I am ignoring all real inputs that give a complex output and need average to be a real number. To first solve this I found the following defined sets of $x^x$ when $x<0$. $$x=-\frac{2m}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ $$x=-\frac{2m+1}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ Each of the sets coincides with another equation so I got the following peice-wise definition. $$x^x=\begin{cases} (-x)^x & x=\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\\ -\left(-x\right)^{x} & x=\left\{ -{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\ \\ \text{undefined} & x\neq\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\bigcup-{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\} \end{cases} $$ Then I took the limit definition of an integral along with $\frac{1}{b-a}$ to determine the average. $$\frac{1}{b-a}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(a+\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)$$ where $f(x)=x^x$ (Note that it is possible to skip $x$-values that given an undefined output in an interval. An example is $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$) When $n\in\left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ there are numbers whose outputs coincide with $(-x)^{x}$ and numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$. So I took the probabilty of having numbers whose ouputs coincide with ($(-x)^x$ vs a numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$ in $[-4,-2]$. I got $\frac{1}{2}$ for both of them. Thus I found when $n \in \left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ as $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{(-2)-(-4)}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{(-x)}^{x}+\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}-{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\right)=0$$ But when $n$ is odd, all numbers in the interval have outputs coinciding only with $(-x)^{x}$. So when $n$ is odd integer and $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{-2+4}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\approx.062152$$ I have two different numbers depending on which $n$value I choose. So does this mean the average does not exist? If not how could one find the average? What other methods can be used to find a real number average? EDIT Analyzing this I believe that one should choose specific $n's$ despite a limit having to accept all $n's$ I presume that an interval of reimmmen sum interval should be as dense as possible and represent all defined numbers. This leads me to believe the average is 0. Since this goes against the definition of a limit, I think the definition of a reimmen sum should be slightly altered for dense defined inputs with undefined outputs. For example I believe intervals with numerator increase of $1$ in $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$ can would give an accurate average compared to an numerator increase of $2$ in $\{-12/3,-10/3,-8/3,-6/3\}$.

So using the limit formula $$Res (f,z_0)= -\frac{\sqrt2}{8}-\frac{\sqrt2}{8}i$$ Used $ML$ Lemma for (c). Stuck on (d). What should i make my region? I was thinking $\Gamma = \Gamma_R + \nabla R$ where $\Gamma_R$ is as stated in the question and $\nabla_R$ is the line from $0$ to $R$ in the real axis. But this would mean $\Gamma $ is not closed. Is this a problem? From using this i got the answer to (d) as $$\frac{\pi \sqrt2}4 -\frac{\pi \sqrt2}4i$$ but really unsure on this since my chosen region is not closed...",,['complex-analysis']

If it helps you, I show below the answer to this problem (I don't know how to get there): $$ -\frac{Ke^{-rT}}{2\pi}\int_{ai-\infty}^{ai+\infty}e^{-iz(\ln\frac{S}{K}+rT)}\varphi(-z)\left(\frac{i}{z}-\frac{i}{z-i} \right)dz = I_1 + I_2 $$ where $$ I_1 = \frac{1}{2}(2\pi i)\frac{Ke^{-rT}i}{2\pi}+\frac{Ke^{-rT}}{2\pi}Pr.Value\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{iu(\ln\frac{S}{K}+rT)}\varphi(u)\frac{i}{u}du \right) $$ and $$ I_2 = -\frac{1}{2}(2\pi i)\frac{iS}{2\pi}+\frac{Ke^{-rT}}{2\pi}Pr.Value\left(\int_{i-\infty}^{i+\infty}e^{iu(\ln\frac{S}{K}+rT)}\varphi(-z)\frac{i}{z-i}dz \right) $$ where in $I_1$ we have used the change of variable $u = -z$. PS: I am especially confused about that $\frac{1}{2}$ at the beginning of the definition of $I_1$ and $I_2$. Why would we only take the half of the residuals ?. Thanks in advance.","I am trying to prove a theorem that is doing my head in a bit. I have tried to simplify the problem as much as possible and leave out the details, even though it might look a bit too big. The simplified problem comes down to solving the following integral: $$ -\frac{Ke^{-rT}}{2\pi}\int_{ai-\infty}^{ai+\infty}e^{-iz(\ln\frac{S}{K}+rT)}\varphi(-z)\left(\frac{i}{z}-\frac{i}{z-i} \right)dz $$ where $a>1$, $K,T,r,S$ are constants and $\varphi$ is some function, where $\varphi(0) = \varphi(-i) = 1$. If my calculations are correct, the residue at $z=0$ is $\left(\frac{-Ke^{-rT}i}{2\pi}\right)$. Similarly, the residue at $z=i$ is $\left(\frac{iS}{2\pi}\right)$.
