1,Prove that a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subgroup.,Prove that a subset of  is a subgroup.,\mathbb{Z},"Came across an interesting question regarding subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ . Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ such that $0 \in A$ , $A = -A$ (for every element in $A$ , its negative is also in $A$ ), and $A + 2A \subseteq A$ (for every $a,b \in A $ , $a+2b \in A$ ). We need to prove that this implies $A$ must be a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$ . Moreover, we need to show that this does not necessarily hold for $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2 $ which has the same properties. Proving subgroups seems to be a challenge, since you get associativity, identity, and inverse for free. However, you cannot prove closure by manipulating the elements (atleast I cannot). I think the solution lies in the second part of the answer, where $A$ has some property that only exists as a subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ and not $\mathbb{Z}^2$ .

We take a ring modulo an element $r$ by taking an equivalence relation where $r_1=r_2$ in the new ring if there is an $r_3$ such that $r_1-r_2=r_3*r$ in the old ring. This new ring can be shown to in fact be a ring, and there is a ring homomorphism from the old ring to the new ring ($r$ gets mapped to $0$). If $r$ is prime-like, is the new ring a field? For example, if you take the integers modulo or a prime $p$ (which is the same as modulo $-p$), it becomes a prime finite field. If you take the real polynomials modulo $x^2+1$, you get the complex number field. Is it true in general that rings modulo prime-like elements are fields?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

So far, my reasoning is as follows: The Galois conjugates of $2^{1/3}$ are $2^{1/3} e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $2^{1/3} e^{4\pi i /3}$.

42,"Mistake in Proof ""Every unique factorization domain is a principal ideal domain""","Mistake in Proof ""Every unique factorization domain is a principal ideal domain""",,"While doing my Algebra HW, I  ""proved"" that every unique factorization domain (UFD) is a principal ideal domain (PID). I know that this is not true, however I fail to see  where exactly is the mistake.  Could someone please pinpoint  whats wrong ? Firstly, to avoid confusion, as a UFD I denote such commutative ring $R$ that there is a subset $\mathbb{P} \subset R:$ All elements of $\mathbb{P}$ are prime,  each prime element $p \in R$ has an associated element $p' \in \mathbb{P}: (p)   = (p')$ and each element $x \in R\setminus ( \{0\} \cup R^*) $ can be written as $x = \varepsilon  \cdot p_1 ^{\nu_1 } \cdot ... \cdot p_m ^{\nu_m}$ , where $\varepsilon \in R^*$ invertable, $p_1, ...,p_m \in \mathbb{P}$ and $\nu_1, ..., \nu_m \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{  0\} $ . Moreover, such factorization is unique up to permutations. Firstly I would like to prove the following statement: Claim 1: $R$ is a UFD and $a, b \in R\setminus \{0\} : a \mid b $ , and $b$ is factorized as $b= \varepsilon _1 p_1^{\nu_1}\cdot ...\cdot p_m^{\nu_m} , p_1,.., p_m \in \mathbb{P}$ are primes and $\varepsilon \in R^*$ - an invertable element, then $a$ is factorized as $a = \varepsilon _2 p_1^{\nu'_1}\cdot ....\cdot p_m^{\nu_m' }$ , where $0 \leq \nu_k ' \leq \nu_k , \forall k \in\{1,..., m\} $ Proof: Let $a \mid b \Leftrightarrow \exists c\in R\setminus \{0\} : b = a\cdot c$ . W.l.o.g assume $c \notin R^* $ (otherwise $q$ is factorized as $q := q \cdot p_1^0 \cdot... \cdot p_m^0$ ). Then, if $a = \varepsilon_1 \cdot q_1 ^{l_1} \cdot ...\cdot q_ n^{l_m}, c = \varepsilon _2 h_1 ^{j_1}\cdot ...\cdot h_k^{j_k}$ , $b = a\cdot c = \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon _2 q_1 ^{l_1} \cdot ...\cdot q_ n^{l_m}h_1 ^{j_1}\cdot ...\cdot h_k^{j_k}$ would be a factorization of $b$ . But factorizations are unique up to permutations, so $q_1 ,.., q_n, h_1,.., h_k \in \{p_1, .., p_n\}$ so (w.l.o.g) $n=m , q_i = p_i, i = 1,.., n$ and $k = m , h_1 = p_1 ,..., h_m = p_m$ . Morever, $p_i^{l_i + j_i } = p_i^{\nu_i}, l_i, j_i \geq 0 \Rightarrow l_i \leq  \nu _i $ $\blacksquare$ Now, the ""proof"" itself: Claim 2: Each UFD is PID Proof: Assume for contradiction, i.e there is $I \subset R, I \neq \emptyset: \forall x \in R: I \neq (x) $ .  Consider $\mathcal{P} := \{ P \subset I : P \text{ is a principal ideal}\}$ . The partial order on $\mathcal{P}$ is given by $""\subset""$ relation. I will show that $\mathcal{P}$ has a maximal element - that is, a principal ideal $P\subset I: \forall P' \subset I$ principal ideals : $P'\subset P$ . For that I wold like to use Zorn's lemma - then, all I need to show is that every chain $\{ P_{\alpha }\} _{\alpha \in A } \subset \mathcal{P}$ is bounded from above: i.e there is an element $P \in \mathcal{P}: \forall \alpha \in A: P_{\alpha} \subset P$ . Firstly, $\{ P_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a chain means that $A$ is a totaly ordered set ( $\forall \alpha_1, \alpha _2\in A: \alpha_1 < \alpha_2 \lor \alpha_1 =\alpha_2 \lor \alpha_2 > \alpha_1$ ) and $\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2 \Rightarrow P_{\alpha_1}\subset P_{\alpha_2}$ . Since $\{P_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ are principal ideals, we can associate this chian with another chain $\{ d_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in A}: \forall \alpha \in A: P_{\alpha} = (d_{\alpha})$ . Since $(d_{\alpha_1}) \subset (d_{\alpha_2}) \Leftrightarrow d_{\alpha_2} \mid d_{\alpha_1}$ , the relations translates to $\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2 \Rightarrow d_{\alpha_2} \mid d_{\alpha_1} $ . Now I would like to show that $P := \bigcup\limits_{\alpha \in A }P_{\alpha}$ is an upper boundary of the chain 1. $P$ is an ideal : Let $x \in P$ . Then, $\exists \alpha \in A: x \in P_{\alpha}$ . Then, $\forall r \in R: rx \in P_{\alpha}$ since $P_{\alpha }$ is an ideal $\Rightarrow rx \in P$ . Let $x_1 , x_2 \in P$ . Then $\exists \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in A : x_1 \in P_{\alpha_1 }, x_2 \in P_{\alpha_2 }$ . W.l.o.g $\alpha_1 \leq \alpha_2 \Rightarrow P_{\alpha_1} \subset P_{\alpha_2} \Rightarrow x_1, x_2 \in P_{\alpha_2} \Rightarrow x_1 + x_2 \in P_{\alpha_2} \Rightarrow x_1 +x_2 \in P$ . Also its clear that $P \subset I$ 2. $P$ is a principal ideal : If $|A|< \mathbb{N}$ the statement is obvious. Otherwise consider $\alpha \in A $ . Then, there are two options: Either $P_\alpha = P$ (and $\forall \alpha' \in A : \alpha ' \leq a $ ), and we are done (since $P_{\alpha}$ is a principal ideal), or there is $\alpha ' \in A : \alpha ' > \alpha$ and $P_{\alpha } \subset P_{\alpha'}$ is a proper subset. However, per note above, $(d_\alpha) = P_{\alpha} \subset P_{\alpha '} = (d_{\alpha'})$ implies $d_{\alpha'} \mid d_{\alpha}$ . We can consider $d_{\alpha }, d_{\alpha'} \neq 0$ since if $\{ P_{\alpha}\} = \{ \{0\} \}$ , it is trivialy bounded from above. So, per claim 1, if $p_{\alpha} = \varepsilon p_1^{\nu_1} \cdot ... \cdot p_n^{\nu_n}$ is a factorization of $p_{\alpha}$ , then $p_{\alpha'} = \varepsilon' p_1^{\nu_1'} \cdot ... \cdot p_n^{\nu_n'}$ , $0 \leq \nu_1 ' \leq \nu_1 ,...., 0 \leq \nu_n' \leq \nu _n$ is a factorization of $p_{\alpha'}$ . Moreover, $(d_\alpha) $ is a proper subset $(d_{\alpha'})$ , i.e $p_{\alpha'}$ and $p_{\alpha}$ are not associated, so there must be at least one $k \in \{1 ,..., n\} : \nu_k' < \nu_k$ . Now repeat the considerations for $P_{\alpha'}$ : Either $P_{\alpha'} = P$ and the statement is true, or there is a proper overset $P_{\alpha''} \supset P_{\alpha'}$ . For $d_{\alpha''}$ the factorization is given by $p_{\alpha'} = \varepsilon' p_1^{\nu_1''} \cdot ... \cdot p_n^{\nu_n''}$ , where $\nu_k '' \leq \nu _k', \forall k \in\{ 1,..., n\}$ and for at least 1 $k \in \{1,...,n\}: \nu_k '' < \nu_k' $ . Then consider $P_{\alpha''}$ and so on. However this process cant go on forever - indeed, if it continues for at most $\nu_1 + \nu _2 + ... + \nu_n :=N$ steps we would get an ideal $P_{\alpha^{(N)}} = (d_{\alpha^{(N)}})$ , where $d_{\alpha^{(N)}}$ can be factorized as $d_{\alpha^{(N)}}  = \varepsilon^{(N)}p_1^0 \cdot ... \cdot p_n^0 \in R^* \Rightarrow (d_{\alpha^{(N)}}) = (1) = R$ , however we assumed that $P_{\alpha^{(N)}} \subset I$ where $I$ is not a principal ideal, so a contradiction. This means that the process breaks down after finitely many steps, and we would get that $P = P_{\alpha^{(K)}} = (d_{\alpha^{(K)}}) $ , so its a principal ideal Now we have shown that $P \subset I$ and $P$ is a principal ideal $\Rightarrow P \in \mathcal{P}$ and $\forall \alpha \in A : P_{\alpha } \subset P$ , so its an upper boundary. Lemma of Zorn now yields that there is such $P \in \mathcal{P}: \forall P' \in \mathcal{P}: P' \subset P$ . But this gives us a contradiction: On one hand, $P \subset I$ is a proper subset, since we assumed that $I$ is not a principal ideal. On the other hand $\forall x \in I: x \in (x) \subset I$ , where $(x)$ is a principal ideal, so $(x) \subset P \Rightarrow x \in P \Rightarrow I \subset P$ . $\blacksquare$ I fail to see whats exactly worng here - I guess that would be either the way I use Zorn's lemma (which is still a new concept to me), or the part where is show that $P$ is a principal ideal.

I am tempted to say that it is the kernel. But the following concerns me: 1) How do I know that it is the subgroup of order 12 of $S_4$? How do I know there are no others? I know odd permutations do not form one, but is there a simpler/more elegant way to say it rather than going into ""consider a group with some even, some odd permutation cycles. Let's show it's not closed and thus can't be a subgroup of $S_4$?"" 2) A more general question, if a group has a subgroup, its order divides the group's order. But how many subgroups of such order can it maximally have (not talking about cyclic groups, who have unique subgroups for every order)? That is, let's say if I have a group of order 24, it could have 2 disjoint (besides the identity) subgroups of order 12 presumably, but could it have more? Obviously, with elements of both of the aforementioned disjoint (besides the identity) subgroups. What is the general theory behind this that could be used to answer the question (I feel like I either haven't studied it yet, or am missing something important). I know when we are dealing with cosets, everything gets broken down into equal-sized chunks, so if order of a subgroup is k and of group is x, you have exactly $\frac{x}{k}$ cosets. Thank you very very much.","Good day, I am given a problem: there is a homomorphism from $S_4$ onto $Z_2,$ and I am asked to find its kernel.

The reason why I'm asking is the following: Every ideal contains $0$. If $x \in R$ is nilpotent this implies that $0 = x^n$ is in every ideal and therefore, by an induction argument ($x \cdot x^{n-1}$), so is $x$. Therefore the nilradical is a subset of the intersection of all non-zero ideals. Therefore it is the smallest ideal in the ring. What I'm not so sure about though is what to do about $0$. I could take the intersection over all ideals, including $(0)$ and the nilradical would still be a subset. Which would be a (wrong) proof that the nilradical is the zero ideal...
