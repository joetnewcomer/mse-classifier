17,Proof of the theorem about term-wise differentiation of power series,Proof of the theorem about term-wise differentiation of power series,,"I have some doubts concerning the proof of the ""term-wise differentiation of power series"" theorem. Below, I first included 3 theorems that are used in the proof; then, I included the whole proof and state the related theorems; finally, I included my specific doubts about it. The theorems used in the proof are basically the Squeeze Theorem and the facts that the first and second derivatives of a power series have the same radius of convergence as the original power series. They are stated as follows: Theorem 1: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_nx^{n-1}.$ Theorem 2: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty} n(n-1)c_nx^{n-2}.$ Theorem 3 (also known as Squeeze Theorem): Assume $f$, $g$ and $h$ are functions defined in an open interval $I$ containing $a$, except, possibly, at $a$ itself, and that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$ such that $x\neq a$. If both $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a}h(x)$ exist and are equal to $L$, then $\lim_{x\to a}g(x)$ also exists and is equal to $L$. The theorem statement and its proof, about which I have some questions, are below: Theorem: Let $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ be a power series whose radius of convergence is $R>0$. Then, if $f$ is the function defined by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n \ \ \ \ (1)$$ $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in the open interval $(-R,R)$, and it is given by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} n c_nx^{n-1}$$ PROOF : Let $x$ and $a$ be two distinct numbers in the open interval $(-R,R)$. The Taylor formula, with $n = 1$, is $$f(x) = f(a) + \dfrac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f''(\xi)}{2!}(x-a)^2$$ Using this formula with $f(x) = x^n$, we have, for every positive integer $n$,   $$x^n=a^n+na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2 \ \ \ \ (2)$$   where $\xi_n$ is between $a$ and $x$, for every positive integer $n$. From (1) we have   $$\begin{align} f(x)-f(a) &= \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\           &= c_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - c_0 - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\           &= \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n(x^n - a^n) \end{align}$$   Dividing by $x-a$ (because $x\neq a$) and using (2), we have, from the above equation   $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \dfrac{1}{x-a} \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n[na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2] $$   Thus,   $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (3)$$ Since $a$ is in $(-R,R)$, it follows from Theorem 1 that $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$ is absolutely convergent. Since both $a$ and $x$ are in $(-R,R)$, there exists a number $K > 0$ such that $|a|<K<R$ and $|x|<K<R$. It follows from Theorem 2 that $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}$$ is absolutely convergent. Then, since $$|n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}| < |n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}| \ \ \ \ (4)$$ for every $\xi_n$, we can conclude, from the comparison test, that   $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}$$   is absolutely convergent.

Since the series on the right side of (7) is absolutely convergent, the limit on the right side, as $x$ approaches $a$, is zero. Thus, from (17) and from Theorem 3 (Squeeze Theorem), it follows that   $$\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$$   which is equivalent to   $$f'(a)=\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$$   and, since $a$ can be any number in the open interval $(-R,R)$, the theorem is proven.

So, I think that, since $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x = a$, then I know that $lim_{x\to a} [f(x)-f(a)]/(x-a)$ exists; so I can simply distribute the limit over the sum and arrive at the result. Is this correct?","I have some doubts concerning the proof of the ""term-wise differentiation of power series"" theorem. Below, I first included 3 theorems that are used in the proof; then, I included the whole proof and state the related theorems; finally, I included my specific doubts about it. The theorems used in the proof are basically the Squeeze Theorem and the facts that the first and second derivatives of a power series have the same radius of convergence as the original power series. They are stated as follows: Theorem 1: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_nx^{n-1}.$ Theorem 2: If the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ is $R>0$, then R is also the radius of convergence of the series $\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty} n(n-1)c_nx^{n-2}.$ Theorem 3 (also known as Squeeze Theorem): Assume $f$, $g$ and $h$ are functions defined in an open interval $I$ containing $a$, except, possibly, at $a$ itself, and that $f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$ such that $x\neq a$. If both $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a}h(x)$ exist and are equal to $L$, then $\lim_{x\to a}g(x)$ also exists and is equal to $L$. The theorem statement and its proof, about which I have some questions, are below: Theorem: Let $\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n$ be a power series whose radius of convergence is $R>0$. Then, if $f$ is the function defined by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n \ \ \ \ (1)$$ $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in the open interval $(-R,R)$, and it is given by $$f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} n c_nx^{n-1}$$ PROOF : Let $x$ and $a$ be two distinct numbers in the open interval $(-R,R)$. The Taylor formula, with $n = 1$, is $$f(x) = f(a) + \dfrac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f''(\xi)}{2!}(x-a)^2$$ Using this formula with $f(x) = x^n$, we have, for every positive integer $n$,   $$x^n=a^n+na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2 \ \ \ \ (2)$$   where $\xi_n$ is between $a$ and $x$, for every positive integer $n$. From (1) we have   $$\begin{align} f(x)-f(a) &= \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\           &= c_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_nx^n - c_0 - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_na^n\\           &= \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n(x^n - a^n) \end{align}$$   Dividing by $x-a$ (because $x\neq a$) and using (2), we have, from the above equation   $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \dfrac{1}{x-a} \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} c_n[na^{n-1}(x-a)+\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)(\xi_n)^{n-2}(x-a)^2] $$   Thus,   $$ \dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}+\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (3)$$ Since $a$ is in $(-R,R)$, it follows from Theorem 1 that $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}nc_na^{n-1}$ is absolutely convergent. Since both $a$ and $x$ are in $(-R,R)$, there exists a number $K > 0$ such that $|a|<K<R$ and $|x|<K<R$. It follows from Theorem 2 that $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}$$ is absolutely convergent. Then, since $$|n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}| < |n(n-1)c_nK^{n-2}| \ \ \ \ (4)$$ for every $\xi_n$, we can conclude, from the comparison test, that   $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}$$   is absolutely convergent. It follows from (3) that $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| = \left|\frac{1}{2}(x-a)\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)c_n(\xi_n)^{n-2}\right| \ \ \ \ (5)$$ However, we know that, if $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}u_n$ is absolutely convergent, then $$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}u_n\right| \leq \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}|u_n|$$ Applying this to the right side of (5), we obtain:   $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}|x-a|\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)|c_n||\xi_n|^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (6)$$   From (4) and (6), we obtain:   $$ \left|\dfrac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a} - \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} nc_na^{n-1}\right| \leq \frac{1}{2}|x-a|\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty}n(n-1)|c_n|K^{n-2} \ \ \ \ (7)$$   where $0<K<R$. Since the series on the right side of (7) is absolutely convergent, the limit on the right side, as $x$ approaches $a$, is zero.

Since $$ q!s_q = q!\left( 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{1}{q!} \right) $$ is an integer, we see that $q!(e-s_q)$ is an integer. Since $q\geq 1,\ \eqref{eq2}\ $ implies the existence of an integer between $0$ and $1.$ We have thus reached a contradiction. Now onto my attempted proof that for an infinite $A\subset \mathbb{N},\ f:= \displaystyle\sum_{k\in A} \frac{1}{k!}$ is irrational. First, write $A$ as an increasing sequence of integers: $A = \left( a_k \right)_{k=1}^{\infty}.$ Define $ \displaystyle t_n:= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{a_k!}.\ $ Then, $$f - t_n = \sum_{k=n+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{a_k!}< \frac{1}{a_{n+1}!}\left\{ 1 + \frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+1)(a_{n+1}+2)\cdots a_{n+2} } + \frac{1}{(a_{n+1}+1)(a_{n+1}+2)\cdots a_{n+2}(a_{n+2}+1)\cdots a_{n+3} } +  \ldots \right\}.$$ Since $a_n \geq n$ and $a_{n+1}>a_n,$ we can certainly say that $0 < f - t_n < \frac{1}{n!n}$ by comparison with the reasons given for $\eqref{eq1},$ although this inequality is weak and could be improved. But then if we continue the proof similar to irrationality of $e,$ that is, suppose $f=p/q,\ p,q$ are integers. Then $0 < q!(f-t_q) < \frac{1}{q}$ is true, but there are problems in the next statement: we cannot say $q!t_q = q!\left( \frac{1}{a_1!} + \frac{1}{a_2!} + \ldots + \frac{1}{a_q!} \right) $ is an integer. Alternatively, $a_q!t_q$ is an integer, although I don't see how to use this to make an equation like equation $\eqref{eq1}.$ Have I made a mistake somewhere?

According to the WolframAlpha , the general term of the sequence above is $$u_n = \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{2^{n - 1}}\right)\left(1 - \dfrac{2 - \sqrt 3}{2^{n - 1}}\right), \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$$ If we define sequences $(v_n)$ and $(w_n)$ as $v_n = 1 - \dfrac{1}{2^{n - 1}}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ and $w_n = 1 - \dfrac{2 - \sqrt 3}{2^{n - 1}}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ respectively, then it can be obtained that $u_n = v_nw_n, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ and $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} v_1 &= 0\\ v_{n + 1} &= \dfrac{v_n + 1}{2}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+ \end{aligned} \right. \text{ and } \left\{ \begin{aligned} w_1 &= -1 + \sqrt 3\\ w_{n + 1} &= \dfrac{w_n + 1}{2}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+ \end{aligned} \right.$$ That means $$\begin{aligned} v_{n + 1}w_{n + 1} = \dfrac{v_nw_n + \sqrt{6v_nw_n + 3}}{4} &\iff \dfrac{(v_n + 1)(w_n + 1)}{4} = \dfrac{v_nw_n + \sqrt{6v_nw_n + 3}}{4}\\ &\iff v_n + w_n + 1 = \sqrt{6v_nw_n + 3}\\ &\iff w_n = (2v_n - 1) + \sqrt 3(1 - v_n), \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+ \end{aligned}$$ Anyhow, about the sequence $(u_n)$ itself, it is strictly increasing bounded. More specifically, we have that $u_n \in [0; 1), \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ . The same goes for sequences $(v_n)$ and $(w_n)$ . Actually, $v_{n + 1} = \dfrac{v_n + 1}{2}$ and $w_{n + 1} = \dfrac{w_n + 1}{2}$ , those look familiar, hmmm~ Of course, I forgot. If we let $v_n = \cos a_n, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ and $w_n = \cos b_n, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+$ , then it can be obtained that $$\left\{ \begin{aligned} a_1 &= \dfrac{\pi}{2}\\ \cos(a_{n + 1}) &= \cos^2\dfrac{a_n}{2}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+ \end{aligned} \right. \text{ and } \left\{ \begin{aligned} b_1 &= \arccos(-1 + \sqrt 3)\\ \cos(b_{n + 1}) &= \cos^2\dfrac{b_n}{2}, \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+ \end{aligned} \right.$$ Nevermind, that didn't work as well as I had thought. What was I doing this entire time? You might be wondering. Well, I'm trying to find the general term of sequence $(u_n)$ without the need of a laptop, since you can't take that into the testing room. Anyhow, for the second part of the problem, first of all, let $\lim u_n = m$ , then we have that $m = \dfrac{m + \sqrt{6m + 3}}{4} \iff m = 1$ . Again, the same goes for sequences $(v_n)$ and $(w_n)$ . Futhermore, $$\begin{aligned} \left\{ \begin{aligned} 2^n(v_n - 1) &= -2\\ 2^n(w_n - 1) &= 2\sqrt 3 - 4 \end{aligned} \right. &\iff \left\{ \begin{aligned} 2^n(v_n + w_n - 2) &= 2\sqrt{3} - 6\\ 4^n(v_n - 1)(w_n - 1) &= 8 - 4\sqrt{3} \end{aligned} \right.\\ &\implies 4^n\left[u_n - \left(\dfrac{2\sqrt{3} - 6}{2^n} + 2\right) + 1\right] = 8 - 4\sqrt{3}\\ &\iff 4^n(u_n - 1) = (8 - 4\sqrt{3}) - 2^n(6 - 2\sqrt{3})\\ &\iff 2^n(u_n - 1) = \dfrac{(8 - 4\sqrt{3})}{2^n} - (2\sqrt{3} - 6), \forall n \in \mathbb Z^+\\ &\implies \lim[2^n(u_n - 1)] = 2\sqrt{3} - 6 \end{aligned}$$ In conclusion, $a + b = 2 + (2\sqrt{3} - 6) = 2\sqrt{3} - 4$ .

In this case, the recurrence for the Catalan numbers (which are integers) is given by $r=2$ : $(n+1)a_{n} - 2(2(n-1)+1)a_{n-1}=(n+1)a_{n} - (4n-2)a_{n-1}=0\quad a_{0}=1$ As it was pointed out in the commentary $$a_{n}=\dfrac{((r - 1) r^2)^n Γ\left(n + \dfrac{1}{r}\right)}{Γ(n + 2) Γ\left(\dfrac{1}{r}\right)}$$ Using the formula found in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particular_values_of_the_gamma_function $$Γ\left(n + \dfrac{1}{r}\right)=Γ\left(\dfrac{1}{r}\right)\dfrac{(rn-r+1)!^{(r)}}{r^n}$$ where $(n)!^{(r)}$ is the $r^{th}$ multifactorial of $n$ . Therefore, for $n\in \mathbb{N}_{0}$ and $r\geq 2 \in \mathbb{N}$ $$a_{n}=\dfrac{(r-1)^{n}r^{n}(r(n-1)+1)!^{(r)}}{(n+1)!}$$ Thus, the problem reduces to show that $(n+1)!$ divides $(r-1)^{n}r^{n}(r(n-1)+1)!^{(r)}$ The motivation behind the question arises from a computational experiment to find rational approximations $\dfrac{p_{n}}{q_{n}}$ to $Γ\left(\dfrac{1}{r}\right)$ , looking for a proof of the irrationality of this number.

I'd like to ask, if my proof is rigorous and technically correct. (a) Prove that the sequence defined by $x_1 = 3$ and \begin{align*}     x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{4 - x_n} \end{align*} converges. (b) Now that we know $\lim x_n$ exists, explain why $\lim x_{n+1}$ must also exist and equal the same value. (c) Take the limit of each side of the recursive equation in part (a) to explicitly compute the $\lim x_n$ . Proof. (a) By direct computation, we find that $x_1 = 3$ , $x_2 = 1$ . Let us prove that $(x_n)$ is a decreasing sequence, that is $x_{n+1} < x_{n}$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$ . This is true for $n=1$ . By induction, let's assume that $x_{k+1} < x_k$ . Therefore, \begin{align*} 	x_{k+1} &< x_{k} \implies \frac{1}{4 - x_{k+1}} < \frac{1}{4 - x_k} \implies x_{k+2} < x_{k+1} \end{align*} So, $(x_{n})$ is a monotonically decreasing sequence. Moreover, we can show that $(x_n)$ is bounded. We are interested to show that $x_n > 0$ for all $n \in \mathbf{N}$ . This holds for $n=1$ . Assume that $x_k > 0$ , then \begin{align*} 	x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{4 - x_k} > \frac{1}{4} > 0 \end{align*} Thus, the sequence $(x_n)$ has a lower bound $0$ . By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence $(x_n)$ converges. (b) The sequence $(x_{n+1})=x_2,x_3,x_4,\ldots$ also converges and has the same limiting value because the $1$ -tail of $(x_n)$ is a (i) monotonically decreasing sequence (ii) has the same lower bound $0$ .

Then $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} a_kb_k$ is also convergent. I know there already exist a few questions on this problem, however they mostly have additional assumptions (i.e. $\left(b_k\right)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ with $b_k\geq 0$ for all $k$ ). My approach: We define $A_n:=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} a_k$ . As $A_n$ is convergent there exists a bound $A$ such that $|A_n|\leq A$ for all $n$ . We know that $\left(b_k\right)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is convergent and hence the sequence $\left(A_kb_k\right)_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ is also convergent (product of two convergent sequences). Let be $n_1$ and $n_2$ two indices such that for all $n,m$ with $n>m>n_1$ it holds $|A_nb_n-A_mb_m|<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$ and for all $n,m$ with $n>m>n_2$ it holds $|b_n-b_m|<\frac{\epsilon}{2A}$ .

However, I understand why this might be the case. Informally, the $j$ th term, where $1\leq j\leq k$ eventually occurs $j$ times more often than the first term. Also, when the first $k$ terms are $1,$ all the terms in the sequence are one, as evidenced by the proof below. Proof: We proceed by strong induction. Suppose the first $k$ terms are $1.$ Then the $(k+1)$ th term is also $1$ (since it is the average of the first $k$ terms). Assume that the first $k+m$ terms are $1$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}.$ Then we have $a_{m+1} = \cdots = a_{k+m} = 1$ and $a_{k+m+1} = \dfrac{a_{m+1} + \cdots + a_{k+m}}k = 1,$ so the first $k+m+1$ terms are $1.$ Hence by strong induction, all the terms of the sequence are $1$ if the first $k$ terms are $1.$ Since the $j$ th term, $1\leq j\leq k$ occurs $j$ times as often as the first term, we have that $\dfrac{1}a + \dfrac{2}a + \cdots + \dfrac{k}a = 1,$ where $\dfrac{1}a$ is the coefficient of $a_1$ in the limit of the sequence. Hence $\dfrac{k(k+1)}{2a} = 1\Rightarrow a = \dfrac{k(k+1)}2\Rightarrow \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} a_n = \dfrac{a_1}a + \dfrac{2a_2}a +\cdots + \dfrac{ka_k}a = \dfrac{2a_1}{k(k+1)} + \cdots + \dfrac{(2k)a_k}{k(k+1)}.$ Obviously the above reasoning is too informal to be considered a proof, so I am not sure how to prove this.

However, I know that, by p-series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^3} --> converges $$ And if the smaller value converges, then Direct Comparison Theorem tells us nothing.

But if I apply it, then I get $$ A = \lim_n \frac {(n+1)^{n+1}} {(n+1)^{n+1} - n^n} = \lim_n \frac {\left( 1 + \dfrac 1n\right)^{n+1}} {\left( 1 + \dfrac 1n\right)^{n+1} - \dfrac 1n} = \frac {\mathrm e}{\mathrm e - 0} = 1, $$ instead of $\mathrm e / (\mathrm e - 1)$.
