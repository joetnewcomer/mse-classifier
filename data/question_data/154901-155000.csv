If yes, can we choose/bound $d$ in terms of $K$ and $g$? Note. This is not the same question as in the title. The answer to the question in the title is in fact negative as the example below shows for $d=2$. Note: I want rational functions to be really different . So we mod out by the action of the automorphism group of $\mathbf{P}^1_K$. That is, $f$ and $\sigma\circ f$ are the same if $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\mathbf{P}^1_K$. Example 1. We can not have $d=2$. Hyperelliptic maps are unique. Question 2. How does the answer to this question change if we replace $K$ by an algebraically closed  field $k$? Example 2. Let $X$ be a general curve of odd genus  $g\geq 3$ over an algebraically closed field. Then, it has an infinite number of (really different) gonal morphisms. In fact, this family is one-dimensional. Idea. I think the question can be reduced to a question on $\mathbf{P}^1_K$. In fact, it suffices to show that there are infinitely many (really different) rational functions on $\mathbf{P}^1_K$ of some degree, say $3$. In fact, once you know this, composing some  morphism $f:X\to \mathbf{P}^1_K$ with such a rational function gives infinitely many rational functions of degree $d \leq 3 \deg f$. The only problem is then finding (in a controlled way) a morphism $f:X\to \mathbf{P}^1_K$. This is a hard problem, but let's allow finite base change if necessary...","Let $X$ be a curve over a number field $K$ of genus $g\geq 2$.

13,Algorithm for finding the discriminant of algebraic number fields,Algorithm for finding the discriminant of algebraic number fields,,"I am reading J.S.

16,Bounds on the gaps in a variant of polylog-smooth numbers.,Bounds on the gaps in a variant of polylog-smooth numbers.,,"Sorry for the long intro. I think the explanation motivates the question and puts it in context. But if you want to skip the story, then just move on to the grey boxes; they should contain enough information to make out my question. This question is inspired by Sadeq Dousti's question on producing a factored integer from a small interval: Factoring some integer in the given interval . For convenience, I will assume that the problem is to produce a factored integer from the interval $[x-G; x]$, and our goal is to make $G = G(x)$ as small as possible. (Beware that Sadeq's version uses $N$ in place of my $x$, and fixes $G(x)$ concretely to be $O(\log x)$.) One can consider several candidate easily-stated algorithms for this problem, all of which work in the following general way. Let $S$ be a set of integers such that Given a number $N$, testing if $N$ is in $S$ can be done efficiently. Moreover, any $N \in S$ can also be factored in time $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$. The gaps in $S$ are ""small"": for all sufficiently large $x > 0$,   there exists $N \in S$, such that $x - G(x) \leq N \leq x$. (Hence my   notation $G$.) Then the given problem can be solved for intervals of length $G(x)$: just search for an $S$-element in the interval and output its factorization. The whole problem then becomes how small can we make $G(x)$ to be . Here are some candidate sets: Powers of $2$. Primes. The set of numbers $N$ such that all prime divisors of $N$ are at most $\log^A(N)$ for some absolute constant $A < \infty$. I'll call these polylog-smooth numbers. (See the fineprint at the end of the question.) The set of numbers $N$ such that at most one of its prime divisors exceeds $\log^A(N)$ where $A$ is as before. I'll call these almost polylog-smooth numbers. Ok, enough with the names :-). All these examples satisfy the first requirement (testing+factoring) by design. (For instance, in the last case, divide out all small prime divisors of $N$ by brute force, and we will be left with either $1$ or a large prime number, and so we'll be in good shape.) The big question then is to analyze the gaps in these sets. The powers of two are very sparse. They have a gap $G(x) = O(x)$ and this is tight. The primes are suspected to have better gaps (see the Consequences of Riemann hypothesis and Cramér's conjecture ). In short, the gap  might be as small as $O(\log^2 x)$. On the other hand, the best unconditional bound is $O(x^{\theta})$ for $\theta < .53$. I do not have enough background to grok the question of gaps for the polylog-smooth numbers. Nevertheless, I found Andrew Granville's survey on smooth numbers ( Smooth numbers: Computational Number Theory and beyond ) says that even the average gap is around $x^{1/A}$. (I am quoting Theorem 1.14 from page 4/page 270 in the pdf I have linked to.) This might be quite bad compared to the conjectured gap for the primes example, but a great improvement over the powers of $2$. Now, what about the set of almost polylog-smooth numbers? They are denser than the primes, so it's definitely at least as small as $O(\log^2 x)$ conditionally and $O(x^{\theta})$ unconditionally. But taking a clue from the improvement we got in going from the powers of $2$ to the smooth-numbers, I believe that the actual gaps for the almost-smooth numbers should be even better than that of the primes. That is the motivation behind my question: What are the current best bounds on the gaps on the almost polylog-smooth numbers (conditionally and unconditionally)? Specifically, is it possible that $G = O(\log x)$ for this case? Any help? Fineprint that morally shouldn't matter. A number is $B$-smooth if its prime divisors are at most $B$. It seems to me that when people analyze properties of the smooth numbers $\leq x$, they usually set the smoothness parameter $B$ to be a function of $x$, like $B = \log^A x$. I defined a smooth number more ""intrinsically"" by setting $B = \log^A N$. I presume that this is just a technical issue, and none of the bounds will really change that much. If I am wrong, then please let me know. In any case, I see no reason why one definition is better for this application than the other.","Sorry for the long intro.

19,"An application of Keith Conrad's "" Splitting field of $X^3-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ ""","An application of Keith Conrad's "" Splitting field of  over  """,X^3-2 \mathbb{Q},"After reading This Paper , I thought in the case of FLT for n = 3: Let $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$ ,  for $x,y,z$ relatively coprime integer solutions. If $3$ doesn't divide $x,y,z$ then $x^3+y^3+z^3\not\equiv{0}$ mod $9$ .  Because $(\mathbb{Z}/9\mathbb{Z})^3=\{0,1,-1\}$ . So, let's assume that $3$ divides $z$ . The pure cubic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ ,  as Professor Keith Conrad explains,  has ring of integers $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ and an integer basis is: $\left\lbrace 1,\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt[3]{4}\right\rbrace$ .  The prime $3$ is ramified: $\pi^3\nu$ ,  for: $\pi=1+\sqrt[3]{2}$ and $\nu=\sqrt[3]{2}-1$ ,  such that $\nu$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ . We have: $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$ and $-z^3=x^3+y^3$ $\Rightarrow$ $-z^3+3y^3=x^3+4y^3$ .  The expression $x^3+4y^3$ factors in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ as: $(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})(x+\omega y\sqrt[3]{4})(x+\omega^2 y\sqrt[3]{4})\,=\,(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})(x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4})$ .  So: $-z^3+3y^3=(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})(x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4})$ (1) . (Where $\omega=(-1+\sqrt{-3})/2$ is a primitive cube root of unity). I will consider here two lemmas as proved. An impossibility of being rational numbers in $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ implies the impossibility of being it in $\mathbb{Z}$ ( $\mathbb{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ ) .  And the extension of arithmetic rules (for example: to be relatively coprime) of $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ . A)  If $x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ is coprime to $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ ,  it will be coprime to $(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})^2=x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}+2xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ .  Let's see it. The sum is: $2x^2+4y^2\sqrt[3]{2}+xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ and the difference: $-3xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ .  And only by $3$ we see $-3xy$ doesn't divide $2x^2$ either $4y^2$ or $xy$ . Because $3$ only divides $z$ . B)  Let's see it in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)$ .  If $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ is coprime to $x+\omega y\sqrt[3]{4}$ ,  its addition and its substraction will neither have common factors. The sum is: $2x+y\sqrt[3]{4}(1+\omega)$ and the difference: $y\sqrt[3]{4}(1-\omega)$ .  The expression $1+\omega$ is a unit in $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ and $1-\omega=-(\omega-1)$ divides $3=-\omega^2(\omega-1)^2$ .  Then $1-\omega$ doesn't divide $2x$ or $y\sqrt[3]{4}(1+\omega)$ .  It is only left to see with $x+\omega^2 y\sqrt[3]{4}$ .  Its sum is: $2x+y\sqrt[3]{4}(1+\omega^2)$ and its difference: $y\sqrt[3]{4}(1-\omega^2)$ .  But $1+\omega^2$ is also a unit in $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ (the conjugate of $1+\omega$ )  and $1-\omega^2=(1+\omega)(1-\omega)$ .  Then, for the same reason than before $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ is coprime to $x+\omega^2 y\sqrt[3]{4}$ and therefore to $x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ . As $3$ divides $-z^3$ (1) ,  then $\pi=1+\sqrt[3]{2}$ ,  where is prime in $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ ,  must divide $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ or $x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ and only one. Let's check it out: $\dfrac{(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})(\pi^2\nu)}{\pi\cdot\pi^2\nu}\,=\,\dfrac{(x+y\sqrt[3]{4})(1-\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{4})}{3}\,=\,\dfrac{x-2y+(2y-x)\sqrt[3]{2}+(x+y)\sqrt[3]{4}}{3}$ Without loss of generality we assume $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$ $\Rightarrow$ $1-1+0\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ .  So: $x\equiv{1}$ mod $3$ and $y\equiv{-1}$ mod $3$ .  In this way, we observe that: $x-2y\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ , $2y-x\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ and $x+y\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ .  Therefore $\pi$ divides $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ . Now let's check this: $\pi$ doesn't divide $x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ . $\dfrac{(x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4})(\pi^2\nu)}{\pi\cdot\pi^2\nu}\,=\,\dfrac{(x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4})(1-\sqrt[3]{2}+\sqrt[3]{4})}{3}$ $=\,\dfrac{x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}-x^2\sqrt[3]{2}-2y^2\sqrt[3]{4}+2xy+x^2\sqrt[3]{4}+4y^2-2xy\sqrt[3]{2}}{3}$ $=\,\dfrac{x^2+2xy+4y^2+(2y^2-x^2-2xy)\sqrt[3]{2}+(x^2-xy-2y^2)\sqrt[3]{4}}{3}$ But: $x^2+2xy+4y^2\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ , $2y^2-x^2-2xy\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ and $x^2-xy-2y^2\equiv{0}$ mod $3$ .  This is a contradiction and tell us if $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$ ,  then $3$ divides $x,y$ and $z$ in $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ . In particular, if $3$ divides $x+y\sqrt[3]{4}$ and $x^2+2y^2\sqrt[3]{2}-xy\sqrt[3]{4}$ ,  at A) we have seen that $3$ should also have divided $x,y$ ,  not just $z$ ;  and at B), in $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2},\omega)$ ,  that $1-\omega$ should have divided $x,y$ in addition to $z$ ,  ( $1-\omega$ is a factor of $3$ ) . But if $3$ divides $x,y,z$ in $\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ and consequently in $\mathbb{Z}$ ; then: $x^3=3^3x'\,^3\,,\,y^3=3^3y'\,^3$ and $z^3=3^3z'\,^3$ . And it there will be a sum $x'\,^3+y'\,^3+z'\,^3=0$ , for $x',y',z'$ integral relatively prime coefficients, less than $x^3+y^3+z^3=0$ .  And so on. Beginning an infinite decreasing. Hence $x,y,z$ cannot be rational. Is it correct? Have I used the concepts of the Paper well?

I´ll just ask what I didn't understand: 1) Therefore, $p^k = (y+1)^2+1$ and $p^j= (y-1)^2+1$ And then: $(y+1)^2 \equiv (y-1)^2 \equiv -1 \pmod p$ So here $-1$ is a quadratic residue, and therefore $p= 4n+1$.

He then says that by$\mod 8$ , $ k$ and $j$ had different parity, so $x$ was odd. Then he assumes that $p, k >1$ and says: If $k=2m$, then: $(y+1)^2= (p^m+1)(p^m -1)$ or if $j= 2m$: then $(y-1)^2= (p^m+1)(p^m -1)$ and affirms those equations have no solution, that might be a property but want to know about it anyway.

Since $ 4y = p^{b} - p^{a}$, therefore $ p^{b-a}=5$, $ p^{a}=y$ $ 2y^{2}+4=p^{b}+p^{a}$, if $ a\neq 0$, then $ y^2 \equiv 3\mod 5$, which is impossible. I don´t know how you can deduce those things. After that he affirmed that $(5,1,1)$ was the only solution. 3) He showed that $y$ was odd and said: $gcd (y^2+2y+2, y^2-2y+2) = gcd (y^2+2y+2, 4y) = 1$ (I think this is also a property but I don´t even know it).

Are the two approaches actually distinct or just different in language? For example, is the the approach via group cohomology just identifying number-theoretical objects with ""cohomological"" objects and then applying theorems? Is it worthy to try and do both at the same time and get a wide view on the subject? EDIT : I forgot that Neukirch has a book about class field theory only. I'm actually using his Algebraic Number Theory.",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'class-field-theory']"

Does it follow that, if $b^x-x\equiv b^y-y\pmod n$, then $x\equiv y\pmod n$? This is inspired by the comments on a previous answer I wrote , which got me thinking about fixed points on exponentiation. Toying around in Mathematica, I noticed that $$x\mapsto 9^x-x\pmod{1000}$$ is an injective function. In fact, I noticed that if we replace $9$ by any other number coprime to $1000$, this still holds. Toying around further, I noticed that the list of numbers $n$ other than $1000$ such that all coprime bases $b$ had this property starts the same way as this sequence in OEIS , which is exactly the sequence of $n$ such that $b^n\equiv 1\pmod n$ for $b$ coprime to $n$.

The only insight I have into the problem is that it clearly holds if $b=1$ or $-1$. The latter can be argued as if $(-1)^n\equiv 1\pmod n$ then $n$ is even and $x\mapsto (-1)^x-x$ maps evens to odds and vice versa and is a linear function with unit ($-1$) coefficient of $x$ over those domains - and hence is bijective. I feel like there may be some generalization of this approach by partitioning $(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z,+)$ into $\text{ord}_n(b)$ cosets (where $\text{ord}$ is the multiplicative order of $b$ mod $n$), but I have been unsuccessful in finding it if it exists. To be sure, restricting the map in question to a single such coset yields a bijection between it and another coset (as $b^{x}-x$ and $b^{x+\text{ord}_n(b)}-x-\text{ord}_n(b)$ are equal mod $\text{ord}_n(b)$) - but I can't prove that two distinct cosets do not map to the same place, as this requires considering the map over the larger domain where it is less well-behaved.

The number $2184$ is the only one listed which has $m$ prime for both solutions and a computational bound of $10^{24}$ is given under which no other solutions have been found. The related sequence A308324 is a subsequence of A057896 which allows only prime $m$ . The question is closely related to the the Pillai Conjecture since uniqueness would imply there are no other solutions (except $3,13$ ) to the Diophantine Equation $p^n - q^m = p - q$ . In 2001 Bennett showed that for fixed p and q this equation has at most two solutions (no triple representations) and further conjectured that the general equation (allowing $p$ and $q$ to be composite) has only the 8 solutions which he presents. For only one of those solutions $(3,13)$ is $p$ and $q$ both prime. If the conjecture made by Bennett is correct this is the only solution to this equation.

This teaches us one very easy method of ruling out solutions to infinitely many Diophantine equations is by showing that they don't have solutions in some (finite!) quotient ring $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ . More generally, this is one way that solutions (to Diophantine equations) in $\mathbb Z$ vs. $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ ""talk to each other"". I am interested in all possible residue classes $r \pmod n$ that this method rules out for the Diophantine equations $x^2 + y^2 = r \pmod n$ . This boils down to wanting to know (what's not in) the image (some subset of $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ closed under multiplication) of the (multiplicative) map $N_n: \mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z [i] \to \mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$ where $N$ refers to the norm $N(x+iy):=x ^2 + y^2$ . For $n$ some prime $p$ , a classic pigeonhole argument ( Sum of two squares modulo p ) tells us that because there are many squares, $N_p$ is surjective. The Chinese remainder theorem tells us that it suffices to look at $n$ some prime power, say $p^n$ (abusing notation a little).  With a little work we can figure out all the squares in $\mathbb Z/p^n\mathbb Z$ : see Efficient way to find squares mod a prime power? , or the formula for the exact number of squares in the quotient ring formula for the number of perfect squares mod $N$ . Unfortunately this count tells us that the pigeonhole argument doesn't work for $n$ composite. Running some experiments https://onlinegdb.com/8raZ0MIzt , I conjecture the following: If $p \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ (I tested $p=5, n=1,2,3,4$ ; and $p=13, n=1,2,3$ ), then $N_{p^n}$ is surjective. If $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ (tested with $p=3,7, 11$ , all powers $<1000$ ), then the only numbers $N_{p^n}$ misses are $r$ who are multiples of $p$ , and whose power of $p$ in the factorization of $r$ is odd (i.e. $r$ with $v_p(r) \in \{1,3,5, \ldots\}$ where $v_p(n)$ denotes the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$ ). If $p=2$ , then the only numbers $N_{2^n}$ misses are all the $3 \pmod 4$ numbers, and their multiples by powers of $2$ . E.g. for $\mathbb Z/512\mathbb Z$ , we have all the $3 \pmod 4$ numbers $3=4(1)-1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31,\ldots, 503, 507, 511=4(2^{9-2})-1$ ; and multiplying by 2: $6, 14, 22, 30, \ldots, 502, 510 = 2\cdot [4(2^{9-3})-1]$ ; and multiplying by 4: $12, 28, \ldots, 508 = 4\cdot [4(2^{9-4})-1]$ ; and so on for a total of $255 = 2^8-1$ bad/impossible numbers. From the Fermat Christmas Theorem, it is easy to show that the ""bad/impossible"" numbers I listed out above are in fact impossible. We have the following ""iff"" statement there exist $x,y\in \mathbb Z$ s.t. $r = x^2 + y^2 \pmod p^n \iff$ there is $k$ and $x,y\in \mathbb Z$ s.t. $p^nk + r = x^2+y^2$ ; or its negation: $r \in \mathbb Z/p^n\mathbb Z$ is not reachable by $N_{p^n} \iff$ for all $k$ , $kp^n+r$ is not a sum of squares (which by the Fermat Christmas Theorem is equivalent to ""every $3 \pmod 4$ primes in the factorization of $kp^n+r$ are raised to an odd power"") Analyzing in the $p=3\pmod 4$ case or $p=2$ case, we see Indeed if $m$ is odd $<n$ ( $<n$ so that $p^m\in \{0,\ldots, p^n-1\}$ ), then $kp^n+p^m = p^m(kp^{n-m}+1)$ , which for any $k$ indeed has highest power of $p$ equal to $m$ (which is odd). If $r=2^m(4l+3)$ , then $k2^n + r = 2^m(k2^{n-m}+(4l+3))$ is (for any $k$ ) a power of 2 times a $3 \pmod 4$ number provided that $m<n$ is not equal to $n-1$ , which we know to be impossible. If $m=n-1$ , then the only possible $r \in \{0,\ldots, 2^n-1\}$ with a factor of $2^m$ is just $2^m$ , which we know to be the sum of squares $2^m= (2^{(m-1)/2})^2 + (2^{(m-1)/2})^2$ if $m$ odd; or $2^m = (2^{m/2})^2+0^2$ if $m$ even.

I was checking how quickly we can verify Goldbach's conjecture for a given even number $n$ and it was clear that backward starting from the largest prime below $n$ was much faster than a forward search starting from the small odd prime $3$ . I observed the following interesting phenomenon. Let $n$ be an even number and $p$ be the largest prime less than $n$ such that $n-p$ is also a prime. Let $p_k$ be the $k$ -th prime. Then, $p_{\pi(n)-2}$ , $p_{\pi(n)-1}$ and $p_{\pi(n)}$ are the three largest primes preceding $n$ . Now $p$ can either be the largest prime below $n$ , or the prime just before the largest prime or the prime before that and so on.

In particular, I'd like to understand the following. Let $f$ be a cuspidal eigenform of weight $k$ and level $\Gamma_1(N)$ , with nebentypus $\epsilon$ . Fix a prime $p\not\mid N$ and suppose that the polynomial $x^2-a_px+\epsilon(p)p^{k-1}$ has an ""allowable root"" $\alpha$ (i.e., $ord_p(\alpha)<k-1$ ), where $a_p$ is the $T_p$ -eigenvalue of $f$ . Let $\chi$ be a $p$ -adic character of conductor $p^n$ . I am trying to fill in the details on their claim that $$\tag{1} L_p(f,\alpha,\chi)=\frac{1}{\alpha^n}\frac{p^n}{\tau(\overline{\chi})}L(f_{\overline{\chi}},1) $$ where the $L$ function on the right is the classical $L$ -function of the twisted form $f_{\overline{\chi}}(z)=\sum \overline{\chi}(n)a_nq^n$ , and $\tau$ is a Gauss sum. In this case, they state in the article that (1) is a ""straightforward computation"" and cite a few earlier formulas, but I'm clearly having some trouble doing this computation. In the article, they define the $p$ -adic $L$ -function by $$ L_p(f,\alpha,\chi):= \int_{\mathbb{Z}_p^\times}\chi d\mu_{f,\alpha}, $$ where $\mu_{f,\alpha}$ is the measure on $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$ defined in terms of modular symbols $\lambda_{f,P}$ ( $P$ is a one variable complex polynomial): $$  \mu_{f,\alpha}(P;a,p^n)=\frac{1}{\alpha^n}\lambda_{f,P}(a,p^n)-\frac{\epsilon(p)p^{k-2}}{\alpha^{n+1}}\lambda_{f,P}(a,p^{n-1}). $$ Essentially, this is the measure of the function $P$ on the open set $a+p^n\mathbb{Z}_p$ . In other words, the integral satisfies: $$ \int_{a+p^n\mathbb{Z}_p}x^j d\mu_{f,\alpha}=\mu_{f,\alpha}(z^j;a,p^n). $$ So we can compute the $p$ -adic $L$ -function by computing modular symbols. My attempt at (1) is as follows. By 8.2., 8.5, and 8.6 in the article (I've put these below), it's easy to see that $$ L(f_{\overline{\chi}},1)=\lambda_{f_{\overline{\chi}},1}(0,1), $$ so we want to relate $L_p(f,\alpha,\chi)$ to $\lambda_{f_{\overline{\chi}},1}(0,1)$ . Since $\chi$ is a $p$ -adic character of conductor $p^n$ , it is constant on the open sets $a+p^n\mathbb{Z}_p$ . So by definition we have \begin{align*} L_p(f,\alpha,\chi) &=\sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\int_{a+p^n\mathbb{Z}_p}d\mu_{f,\alpha}\\ &=\sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\mu_{f,\alpha}(1;a,p^n)\\ &=\frac{1}{\alpha^n}\sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\big(\lambda_{f,1}(a,p^n)-\frac{\epsilon(p)p^{k-2}}{\alpha}\lambda_{f,1}(a,p^{n-1})\big), \end{align*} and this is where I'm stuck. Clearly, it suffices to show that $$ \sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\big(\lambda_{f,1}(a,p^n)-\frac{\epsilon(p)p^{k-2}}{\alpha}\lambda_{f,1}(a,p^{n-1})\big)=\frac{p^n}{\tau(\overline{\chi})}\lambda_{f_{\overline{\chi}},1}(0,1), $$ but this just doesn't seem to be true, since, for example, it would appear that formula 8.5 in the article shows that $$ \sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\lambda_{f,1}(a,p^n)=\frac{p^n}{\tau(\overline{\chi})}\lambda_{f_{\overline{\chi}},1}(0,1). $$ Where am I going wrong here?

(8.2) $\chi(-1)\tau(\chi)\tau(\overline{\chi})=m$ (8.5) $\lambda_{f_{\overline \chi}, P(mz)}(b,n)=\frac{1}{\tau(\chi)}\sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times}\chi(a)\lambda_{f,P}(mb-na,mn)$ (8.6) $L(f_{\overline \chi},n+1)=\frac{1}{n+1}\frac{(-2\pi i)^n}{m^{n+1}}\tau(\bar\chi)\sum_{a\in (\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^\times} \chi(a)\lambda_{f,z^n}(a,m)$","I'm trying to fill in the details in proposition 14 of this paper by Mazur, Tate, and Teitelbaum.

I am trying to fill in the details on their claim that where the function on the right is the classical -function of the twisted form , and is a Gauss sum. In this case, they state in the article that (1) is a ""straightforward computation"" and cite a few earlier formulas, but I'm clearly having some trouble doing this computation. In the article, they define the -adic -function by where is the measure on defined in terms of modular symbols ( is a one variable complex polynomial): Essentially, this is the measure of the function on the open set . In other words, the integral satisfies: So we can compute the -adic -function by computing modular symbols. My attempt at (1) is as follows. By 8.2., 8.5, and 8.6 in the article (I've put these below), it's easy to see that so we want to relate to . Since is a -adic character of conductor , it is constant on the open sets . So by definition we have and this is where I'm stuck. Clearly, it suffices to show that but this just doesn't seem to be true, since, for example, it would appear that formula 8.5 in the article shows that Where am I going wrong here?

69,Can large numbers be expressed as sums of large primes?,Can large numbers be expressed as sums of large primes?,,"A well known result states that every integer $n \geq 7$ is the sum of distinct primes (we allow sums consisting just of one summand). Another way of writing this is that each $n \geq 7$ can be written as $n=\sum_{k \geq 1} a_kp_k$ where each $a_k \in \{0,1\}$ and $p_k$ is the $k$ th prime.

I've shown that by Euler's pentagonal number theorem $$F(\tau) = \eta(\tau)\eta(23\tau) = \sum_{u,v \in \mathbb{Z}} (-1)^{u+v}q^{((6u+1)^2 + 23(6v+1)^2)/24}.$$ From the paper, we have that F is a modular form of type $(1,\epsilon)$ of $\Gamma_0(92)$ , where $$\epsilon(d) = \left( \frac{-23}{d} \right).$$ The Hecke operator acts on F by $$T_pF = F(p\tau) + \frac{1}{p}\sum_{b=0}^{p-1}F\left(\frac{\tau +b}{p}\right)$$ I don't think it should be too hard to show this is an eigenform, I probably just need to show that $a(n)$ is multiplicative and maybe some relationship between consecutive prime powers. Though, I'm unsure as to whether the multiplicativity should follow from it being a Hecke eigenform, and that I should be proving it a different way. Once it is shown to be a Hecke eigenform, there is a theorem by Serre and Deligne, which says that there is a corresponding linear representation $$\rho: \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \to GL_2(\mathbb{C})$$ and if $p$ is a prime for which $\rho$ is unramified, then $$\mathrm{tr}(\rho(\text{Frob}_p)) = a(p) \quad\text{ and }\quad \det(\rho(\text{Frob}_p)) = \epsilon(p).$$ Furthermore, $\ker\rho = \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/K)$ , where $K$ is some finite Galois extension. My main question is this: How do I find a polynomial $f$ such that $K$ is the splitting field of $f$ ? For this particular case, I know that $f(x) = x^3-x-1$ works, but I have no clue how to show this is true. My professor, sent me a link to this site, and I should be able to determine which extension it is by just looking at traces, but I'm curious as to whether there are any general methods for computing this . I'm able to show that $a(p) = 0 \iff \rho(\text{Frob}_p)$ is a matrix of order 2 , and by looking at conjugacy classes of $S_3$ I can determine that this corresponds to the fact that $f(x)$ factors as a linear polynomial and an irreducible quadratic over $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ . Similarly, $f(x)$ is irreducible if $a(p) = -1$ , and $f$ splits completely if $a(p) = 2$ . Showing that these are the only values $a(p)$ can take shouldn't be too hard. I imagine it just involves some modular arithmetic and that fact that the theorem by Serre and Deligne gives that $|a(p)| \leq 2$ . If I can solve all of this, the last thing I would hope to find, are conditions on $p$ for which $a(p)$ takes on the values above. I can show that $a(p) = 0$ if $\left(\frac{-23}{p}\right)=-1$ . In the paper I'm reading, in a previous example, he uses the fact that if $\left(\frac{-11}{p}\right) = 1$ then there exists $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $p = a^2 + ab + 3b^2$ to show that the coefficients of the modular form in that example are determined by whether $p = x^2 + 11y^2$ or $3p = x^2 + 11y^2$ . However, that claim that $p = a^2+ab+3b^2$ relies on the fact that $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-11}}{2}\right]$ is a UFD. In the example I'm trying to prove, the analogous case would be to use $p = a^2+ab+6b^2$ to split it into the cases of whether $p = x^2+23y^2$ or $6p = x^2 + 23y^2$ , and I can do this with no problems. The main problem with this however, is that $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{-23}}{2}\right]$ has class number 3, so we don't always have that $p = a^2 + ab + 6b^2$ . My final question is how can I get around this failure of unique factorization? One idea I have, is to instead use the class number and to show that $p^3 = a^2 + ab + 6b^2$ IS possible to possibly determine $a(p^3)$ and then use the recurrence relation for $a(p^n)$ to determine the value of $a(p)$ .

Example: If $\alpha_{1},\ldots, \alpha_{n}\in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is a basis of $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha_{1}^{\vee},\ldots,\alpha_{n}^{\vee}\in K$ is the dual basis with respect to the trace pairing. Let $M=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{Z}\alpha_{i}$ and $M^{\vee}=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\mathbb{Z}\alpha_{i}^{\vee}$. Then, since any $x\in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ can be written as $$ x=\sum^{n}_{i=1}\text{Tr}_{K/ \mathbb{Q} }(x\alpha_{i})\alpha_{i}^{\vee}$$ we have that $M\subseteq M^{\vee}$.

Visualize $M^{\vee}$ as a grid in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (up to coordinate change, we may assume $\alpha_{i}^{\vee} = e_{i}$). Then $M$ is a subgrid and the cardinality of the quotient is the number of times we can fit the fundamental mesh of the finer grid into the one of the coarser grid. Since we did that coordinate change and our finer fundamental mesh is just the unit cube, the caridnality of the quotient is just the volume of the fundamental mesh of the grid given by $M$. By an elementary argument of integral calculus, this is just the determinant of the matrix of base chagne. By the previous formula, this is precisely $$ | \det(\text{Tr}_{K/\mathbb{Q}}(\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j})) |$$ My problem: (see EDIT below) I want to see that the norm of an ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{K}$ is the number of times that the fundamental mesh of the grid corresponding to $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ fits into the subgrid defined by $I$.

Any help/reference is appreciated! EDIT Thanks to the useful comment below, I realized that my hopes were wrong: the subgrid corresponding to the ideal is not always aligned with the grid of the ring of integers. But it is still possible to do a basechange to get this geometric interpretation of the norm. If $K$ has $r_{1}$ real embeddings and $r_{2}$ pairs of complex embeddings, then we can define a map $$ \lambda \colon K \to \mathbb{R}^{r_{1}+2r_{2}}=\mathbb{R}^{n} $$ given by $x \mapsto (\sigma_{1}(x),\ldots, \sigma_{r_{1}}(x),\text{Re}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2}(x)),\text{Im}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2}(x)), \ldots, \text{Re}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2r_{2}}(x)),\text{Im}(\sigma_{r_{1}+2r_{2}}))$.
