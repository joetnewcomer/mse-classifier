66,The bird pointer problem: finding the angle of rotation,The bird pointer problem: finding the angle of rotation,,"Suppose we have a bird pointer. He is a guy that likes to point at birds in the sky: His legs cannot move, however he can rotate around his torso. Also, his body and his arm always make a right angle. Here's a simplified diagram of the problem at hand: The problem is, given his torso location $(x_1, y_1)$, body height $h$, and bird location $(x_2, y_2)$, how much should he rotate? The amount of rotation is notated as $t$ in the following diagram (positive is counter clockwise): If the angle between his arm and body is 90 degrees, then the angle between his arm and the x axis is the same as the amount of rotation, which is $t$. Therefore we know that $\tan{t} = \frac{y_2-y_3}{x_2-x_3}$. We also know that $x_3 = x_1 - h \sin{t}$ and also $y_3 = y_1 + h \cos{t}$ Putting them all together $\tan{t} = \frac{y_2 - (y_1 + h \cos{t})}{x_2 - (x_1 - h \sin{t})}$ $\frac{\sin{t}}{\cos{t}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1 - h \cos{t}}{x_2 - x_1 + h \sin{t}}$ $(x_2 - x_1 + h \sin{t})\sin{t} = (y_2 - y_1 - h \cos{t})\cos{t}$ Let as denote $x_2 - x_1$ by $dx$ and $y_2 - y_1$ by $dy$. Note that both can be calculated from the problem so those are constants. Then the equation becomes $(dx + h \sin{t})\sin{t} = (dy - h \cos{t})\cos{t}$ $dx \sin{t} + h \sin^2{t} = dy \cos{t} - h \cos^2{t}$ $h \sin^2{t} + h \cos^2{t} = dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t}$ $h (\sin^2{t} + \cos^2{t}) = dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t}$ We then use the trigonometric identity $\sin^2{t} + \cos^2{t} = 1$ $dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t} = h$ Therefore, I have reduced to problem to an equation of the form $A \cos{t} + B \sin{t} = C$ However, I have no idea on what to do next to solve for t.

He wants the wall to be in the shape of a regular polygon with sides between $24""-30""$.  He asked me to figure out how many sides he should make it, and then calculate the angles so that he knows how to cut the wood.  The trampoline has a diameter of $16'$. So I attacked the problem at first using Geometry.  I found that the area of the trampoline is approximately $201.1$ $ft^2$.  Then I used the regular polygon formula $A=\frac{a\cdot p}{2}$, where $a$ is the apothem and $p$ is the perimeter for all sides from $24""-30""$.  To make a long story short.  I found that a polygon of $24$ sides with $26""$ sides would best do the trick, and another mathematics friend of mine concurred.  Since we have 24 sides, using the internal angle formula, I know that the sum of the interir angles is $A(24)=180(24-2)=3960$ which means each of the $24$ angles should be $165$ degrees.  Halving this gives me cuts of $82.5$ degrees.

88,Geometry of $k$-forms and $k$-vectors,Geometry of -forms and -vectors,k k,"In this question I was trying to see why $k$-forms are selected as the way to generalize vector calculus rather than $k$-vectors and a comment providing links to other questions made me end up with another doubt on the geometric interpretation of $k$-forms and $k$-vectors. Considering for a while $\Lambda^k(V)$ and $\Lambda^k(V^\ast)$ without regard to manifolds, I've convinced myself very well that an element of $\Lambda^k(V)$ represents simply pieces of $k$-dimensional planes. So for instance, if $v,w\in V$ then $v\wedge w\in \Lambda^2(V)$ would be simply the oriented paralelogram generated by $v$ and $w$ and it would carry it's area as information. My understanding of an element of $\Lambda^k(V^\ast)$ was that of an object which can do measures with objects from $\Lambda^k(V)$. So that if $\omega \in \Lambda^1(V)=V^\ast$, then putting $\hat{\omega}=\omega^{-1}(1)$ we see that $\hat{\omega}$ can represent $\omega$ in the sense that $\omega$ defines what means for a vector to cross $1$ unit along a direction without regard to metrics. Now, my doubt is that in that answers, people consider elements from $\Lambda^k(V^\ast)$ as pieces of $k$-planes also. So that $dx\wedge dy$ would be consider as the paralelogram  $e_1\wedge e_2$. This confuses me a lot, and I think the problem is that I'm really failing to get the interpretation of $k$-forms. Is this right to represent $dx\wedge dy$ by that paralelogram? If so, why is that? How to really get these ideas?","In this question I was trying to see why $k$-forms are selected as the way to generalize vector calculus rather than $k$-vectors and a comment providing links to other questions made me end up with another doubt on the geometric interpretation of $k$-forms and $k$-vectors.
