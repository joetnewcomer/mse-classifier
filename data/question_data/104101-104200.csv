11,Is it possible to prove the derivative of sine geometrically without arc length?,Is it possible to prove the derivative of sine geometrically without arc length?,,"There are a great many ways to prove that the derivative of sine is cosine, some of them based on things like the Taylor series definition.  I’d like to prove it using only the right-triangle definition of trigonometric functions.  But all the proofs I’ve seen involve the notion of the arclength of a circular arc subtended by a given angle and/or the notion of the area of a sector subtended by a given angle. My question is, is it possible to prove that $\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(x)}{x}=1$ and hence $\frac{d}{dx}\sin(x) =\cos(x)$ without invoking the notions of the arclength of a circular arc or the area of a sector?  After all, it is perfectly possible to define the measure of an angle without referring to arclength; it’s done in most modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, like this one : Postulate $11$ . Angle Measurement Postulate. To every angle there corresponds a real number between $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ . Postulate $12$ . Angle Construction Postulate. Let $AB$ be a ray on the edge of the half-plane $H$ . For every $r$ between $0$ and $180$ there is exactly one ray $AP$ , with $P$ in $H$ such that $m \angle PAB = r$ . Postulate $13$ .

The equations, with $x,y,z$ as the edges and $u,v,w$ as the face diagonals, are: $$x^2+y^2=u^2$$ $$y^2+z^2=v^2$$ $$x^2+z^2=w^2$$ I used the (IMHO) well known method: “If $(x,y,z)$ is a solution, then (xy,xz,yz) is also a solution, but applying this to the new solution returns to the original shape.” I don’t know when or where this method of producing Twins originated, or if it has been proven, but it works for every example I’ve tried. However, the calculations soon increase in magnitude. Conjecture 1 If $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is a primitive Euler Brick solution then the following is also a solution, $$(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)=(\frac{x_0y_0}{12},\frac{x_0z_0}{12},\frac{y_0z_0}{12})$$ Put $G_1=gcd(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)$ then a new primitive Euler Brick solution is given by, $$(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(\frac{X_1}{G_1},\frac{Y_1}{G_1},\frac{Z_1}{G_1})$$ Now repeat using $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ as the generator, $$(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)=(\frac{x_1y_1}{12},\frac{x_1z_1}{12},\frac{y_1z_1}{12})$$ Put $G_2=gcd(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ to produce, $$(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(\frac{X_2}{G_2},\frac{Y_2}{G_2},\frac{Z_2}{G_2})$$ If all went well, $x_2=x_0$, $y_2=y_0$ and $y_2=y_0$ Definition If $\frac{G_1}{G_2}<1$ then $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ is the Good twin and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is the Evil Twin. If $\frac{G_1}{G_2}>1$ then $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ is the Evil Twin and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is the Good Twin. Example $$(x_0,y_0,z_0)=(117,44,240)$$ $$(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)=(429,2340,880)$$ $$G_1=gcd(429,2340,880)=1$$ $$(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(429,2340,880)$$ $$(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)=(83655,31460,171600)$$ $$G_2=gcd(83655,31460,171600)=715$$ $$(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(117,44,240)$$ Hence, as $\frac{G_1}{G_2}=\frac{1}{715}$, we find $(117,44,240)$ is the Good Twin and $(429,2340,880)$ is the Evil Twin. The product $G_1G_2=715$, whichever Twin we start from, and is the lowest I’ve found. Conjecture 2 The value of $G_1G_2$ is equal for each of a pair of twins. Conjecture 3 Except for twins, the value of $G_1G_2$ is unique for primitive solutions. Conjecture 4 There are no Identical Twins, where the original solution is returned as $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ in any order. The nearest I’ve found is $(72611,9180,206448)$ and its Evil Twin $(12915,290444,36720)$ My questions I would welcome any help proving or disproving any of these conjectures.

The equations, with $x,y,z$ as the edges and $u,v,w$ as the face diagonals, are: $$x^2+y^2=u^2$$ $$y^2+z^2=v^2$$ $$x^2+z^2=w^2$$ I used the (IMHO) well known method: “If $(x,y,z)$ is a solution, then (xy,xz,yz) is also a solution, but applying this to the new solution returns to the original shape.” I don’t know when or where this method of producing Twins originated, or if it has been proven, but it works for every example I’ve tried. However, the calculations soon increase in magnitude. Conjecture 1 If $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is a primitive Euler Brick solution then the following is also a solution, $$(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)=(\frac{x_0y_0}{12},\frac{x_0z_0}{12},\frac{y_0z_0}{12})$$ Put $G_1=gcd(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)$ then a new primitive Euler Brick solution is given by, $$(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(\frac{X_1}{G_1},\frac{Y_1}{G_1},\frac{Z_1}{G_1})$$ Now repeat using $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ as the generator, $$(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)=(\frac{x_1y_1}{12},\frac{x_1z_1}{12},\frac{y_1z_1}{12})$$ Put $G_2=gcd(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)$ to produce, $$(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(\frac{X_2}{G_2},\frac{Y_2}{G_2},\frac{Z_2}{G_2})$$ If all went well, $x_2=x_0$, $y_2=y_0$ and $y_2=y_0$ Definition If $\frac{G_1}{G_2}<1$ then $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ is the Good twin and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is the Evil Twin. If $\frac{G_1}{G_2}>1$ then $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ is the Evil Twin and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ is the Good Twin. Example $$(x_0,y_0,z_0)=(117,44,240)$$ $$(X_1,Y_1,Z_1)=(429,2340,880)$$ $$G_1=gcd(429,2340,880)=1$$ $$(x_1,y_1,z_1)=(429,2340,880)$$ $$(X_2,Y_2,Z_2)=(83655,31460,171600)$$ $$G_2=gcd(83655,31460,171600)=715$$ $$(x_2,y_2,z_2)=(117,44,240)$$ Hence, as $\frac{G_1}{G_2}=\frac{1}{715}$, we find $(117,44,240)$ is the Good Twin and $(429,2340,880)$ is the Evil Twin. The product $G_1G_2=715$, whichever Twin we start from, and is the lowest I’ve found. Conjecture 2 The value of $G_1G_2$ is equal for each of a pair of twins. Conjecture 3 Except for twins, the value of $G_1G_2$ is unique for primitive solutions. Conjecture 4 There are no Identical Twins, where the original solution is returned as $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ in any order. The nearest I’ve found is $(72611,9180,206448)$ and its Evil Twin $(12915,290444,36720)$ My questions I would welcome any help proving or disproving any of these conjectures. Also, if there is an easier way to identify Twins, I’d love to know about it. Please let me know if I’ve failed to make anything clear.

This is a problem on the plane . Your goal is to maximize the covered surface of the table, your knobs are three real numbers, the tablecloth position and its angle with respect to the table. I am afraid that the optimum depends on how the inequality holds, i.e. the solution changes dramatically if the tablecloth short side is, say, 100 times the table short side. If this is the case please stick to ""reasonable"" values, i.e. the difference between the various dimensions is within the $10\%$ range. And I also believe the solution is symmetrical, i.e. the tablecloth is centered on the table, but I am not entirely sure of it. Folding the tablecloth is not permitted, mainly because the problem gets heavily dependent on the ratio $\frac{d}{b}$.

Here is some (sorta) math jargon, finally: you have a table of known dimensions $a$ and $b$ you have a tablecloth of known dimensions $c$ and $d$ $a>c>d>b$ holds$^*$ Thickness is not a problem, i.e. the tablecloth might hang how much you want and the table sides must not necessarily be covered. This is a problem on the plane . Your goal is to maximize the covered surface of the table, your knobs are three real numbers, the tablecloth position and its angle with respect to the table. I am afraid that the optimum depends on how the inequality holds, i.e. the solution changes dramatically if the tablecloth short side is, say, 100 times the table short side. If this is the case please stick to ""reasonable"" values, i.e. the difference between the various dimensions is within the $10\%$ range. And I also believe the solution is symmetrical, i.e. the tablecloth is centered on the table, but I am not entirely sure of it. Folding the tablecloth is not permitted, mainly because the problem gets heavily dependent on the ratio $\frac{d}{b}$. The question is: How can I prove there is an optimum and find it? $^*$this means that the tablecloth short side is longer than the table short side, and the table long side is longer than the tablecloth long side. Plus both the table and the tablecloth are rectangular.",,"['geometry', 'optimization', 'puzzle']"

For the case of five points, the solution seems to be two points on opposite poles of a diameter plus three equally-separated points on a great circle lying in a plane perpendicular to that diameter. For seven or more points, other than the platonic cases, I have great difficulty determining if there's any  solution better than the poles-plus-great-circle solution given for five points. Is there any better solution I'm missing?",,['geometry']

68,Reflections in regular polygons,Reflections in regular polygons,,"I was thinking about regular polygons and paths beginning at a vertex such that whenever the path hits a side, it has a mirror reflection (angle of incidence equalling the angle of reflection) and continues on, undergoing a mirror reflection whenever it hits a side until it hits a vertex and the path ends. If the polygon is a unit square, $ABCD$, let the path begin at $A$. WLOG, let the first side it hits be  $BC$ and let $E$ be the point of intersection. I figured out that if $BE$ is $\frac{a}{b}$, where $\frac{a}{b}$ is rational and $a,b$ are co-prime, then the path will terminate. I realized that within the cartesian plane, the path described is the same as the path traveled from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ so I can actually figure out the number of reflections during the path, the length of the path and the vertex where it ends (by labeling the lattice points based on reflections of the unit square). Similarly, I realized I can do the same if the polygon is a unit equilateral triangle, $ABC$. Let $A$ (the origin) be the initial starting point and $E$ is the point on $BC$ that the path initially hits, where $BE$ is $\frac{a}{b}$. I can have a tessellation of the plane with unit equilateral triangles and we can consider a large equilateral triangle, $AB'C'$ of side $a+b$. Then the path described is that same as the path from $A$ to $X$, where $X$ is on $B'C'$ such that $B'X$ is $a$. Again, we can ascertain the length of the path, the number of reflections and the vertex where it ends. My question is how would one approach this problem for a regular pentagon or heptagon, or any regular polygon that you cannot tessellate the plane with. In the case of the hexagon, I know that I can tesselate the plane with hexagons but am unsure of how to describe the path in terms of a straight line in terms of $a$ and $b$ and unsure of how to determine the final vertex since different reflections produce different vertices (for example, suppose we reflect the hexagon over $BC$ and over $CD$. Then the image of $B$ is the same as the image of $D$). If anyone knows any other interesting observations, properties or problems (open or closed) about this topic, I'd like to hear about it.

I realized that within the cartesian plane, the path described is the same as the path traveled from $(0,0)$ to $(a,b)$ so I can actually figure out the number of reflections during the path, the length of the path and the vertex where it ends (by labeling the lattice points based on reflections of the unit square). Similarly, I realized I can do the same if the polygon is a unit equilateral triangle, $ABC$. Let $A$ (the origin) be the initial starting point and $E$ is the point on $BC$ that the path initially hits, where $BE$ is $\frac{a}{b}$. I can have a tessellation of the plane with unit equilateral triangles and we can consider a large equilateral triangle, $AB'C'$ of side $a+b$. Then the path described is that same as the path from $A$ to $X$, where $X$ is on $B'C'$ such that $B'X$ is $a$. Again, we can ascertain the length of the path, the number of reflections and the vertex where it ends. My question is how would one approach this problem for a regular pentagon or heptagon, or any regular polygon that you cannot tessellate the plane with. In the case of the hexagon, I know that I can tesselate the plane with hexagons but am unsure of how to describe the path in terms of a straight line in terms of $a$ and $b$ and unsure of how to determine the final vertex since different reflections produce different vertices (for example, suppose we reflect the hexagon over $BC$ and over $CD$. Then the image of $B$ is the same as the image of $D$). If anyone knows any other interesting observations, properties or problems (open or closed) about this topic, I'd like to hear about it.

I begun wondering about how far do I see in the forest on average. I was also reminded to the ""proof"" that the age of the universe is finite, ie. that if universe was infinitely old, the light from every star everywhere would have reached us and no matter where we look in the sky, we would see a point of light, this is not true, thus universe is of finite age. I know that the distribution of the number of tree ""cores"" or centers on a given area $N(A)$ is the Poisson distribution, ie. $P(N(A)=n) = (\lambda A)^n e^{-(\lambda A)}/n!$. So, I asked myself, if I had one of those laser distance measuring things, pointed it to a random direction parallel to the ground and waited till the distance ($X$) was shown, what would be the distribution of $X$? Assume the trees are all of the same diameter $d$, the ground is flat and all trees are perfectly smooth. How would this be generalized to higher dimensions? I then asked the follow up question: if there was a red rectangle placed perpendicular to my line of sight, how far would it have to be placed so that I would no longer be able to see it, ie. the fraction visible behind the trees would be small, ie. smaller than some small $\varepsilon$? edit: The answer to the first question, attempt: Lets take that I stand in an empty spot and fire the laser to a random direction. Assume that $x$ is the distance travelled, $\frac{d}{2} $ is the radius of the trees. (I would like to add a pic, but don't really know how). Then we need to calculate the area where there can be no tree centers. Thus around me there is a circle with radius $d/2$ where there are no trees, the laser is surrounded by area the width of which is $d$ and finally at the end there is a semicircle of radius $\frac{d}{2} $. Thus we sum all these together (negative cause I stood in a clearing of radius $\frac{d}{2} $) $$A = -\frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + x d + \frac{\pi}{2}\left( \frac{d}{2} \right)^2 = x d$$ Then, using the Poisson distribution I gave above, we get the cumulative distribution function of $X$: $$1-P(X\ge x) = 1-e^{- \lambda d x}.$$ This is Weibull distribution with parameters $1$ and $1/(\lambda d)$. The expected value is thus $E(X)=\frac{1}{\lambda d}.$ This answers my first question. I think it would be pretty easy to extend to other dimensions.

Below is my proof that I consider rather long and complex. The given data is on this drawing: Construct $\angle DCE = \angle DCB$ .

Connect points $B$ , $E$ , and $D$ . $_\Delta CDB \cong _\Delta CDE$ by SAS, because $CD$ is their common side, $CB = CE$ by construction, $\angle DCB = \angle DCE$ by construction. Therefore $\angle DBC = \angle DEC$ , as they are opposite to side $CD$ of these triangles. Let $O$ be the intersection point of $AD$ and $CE$ . Also connect points $A$ and $C$ to construct a line $AC$ . $_\Delta ABC$ is isosceles because $AB = BC$ as given by the statement of the theorem. Then $\angle BCA = \angle BCA$ . Since $\angle BAD = \angle BCE$ , then $\angle ECA = \angle DAC$ as well. We have $AO = CO$ because $\angle OAC = \angle OCA$ implies $_\Delta AOC$ is isosceles. As $AD = CE$ , we get $AO + OD = CO + OE$ . As $AO = CO$ , we get $AO + OD = AO + OE$ , which implies $OD = OE$ , therefore $_\Delta OED$ is also isosceles. Even more, $\angle OED = \angle ODE = \angle OAC = \angle OCA$ . $_\Delta AED \cong _\Delta CDE$ by SAS because $AD = CE$ , $ED$ is their common side, and $\angle ADE = \angle CED$ . This implies $\angle EAD = \angle ECD$ , therefore $\angle EAB = 2\alpha - \alpha = \alpha$ , which implies $AE$ is on the angle bisector of $\angle DAB$ . $_\Delta DAB$ is isosceles since $AB = AD$ by theorem's statement. Therefore, angle bisector is also median and altitude. Then median and altitude of $_\Delta BED$ to side $BD$ also coincide, therefore $_\Delta BED$ is isosceles with $BE = ED$ . Since also $BD = DE$ , $_\Delta DEB$ is equilateral, therefore all internal angles of this triangle are equal to one another, $60^\circ each$ . $_\Delta AEB \cong _\Delta AED$ by SAS because $AE$ is their common side, $AB = AD$ , $\angle EAD = \angle EAB$ . Therefore, $\angle ABE = \angle ADE$ . As points $B$ and $O$ are both equidistant from points $A$ and $C$ , they lie on perpendicular bisector of $AC$ . Therefore, $BO$ is also median and angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ . But same goes for $_\Delta BED$ and its angle $\angle EBD$ . Then $\angle EBO = \angle DBO = 0.5\cdot 60^\circ = 30^\circ$ . By using the notation on the last image, $\angle ABC = \beta + 30^\circ + 30^\circ + \beta = 60^\circ + 2\beta$ . Consider the right triangle $_\Delta BCG$ . Its acute angles sum up to $90^\circ$ , therefore: \begin{align*} 30^\circ + \beta + \alpha + \alpha + \beta &= 90^\circ \\ 2\alpha + 2\beta &= 60^\circ \\ \alpha + \beta &= 30^\circ \\ \beta &= 30^\circ - \alpha \end{align*} Now we are ready to express $\angle ABC$ : $$ 60^\circ + 2\beta  = 60^\circ + 2(30^\circ - \alpha)  = 60^\circ + 60^\circ - 2\alpha  = 120^\circ - 2\alpha $$ Which was to be proven.
