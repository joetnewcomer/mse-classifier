39,Formula for the ratio of Numbers not divisible by the first n primes,Formula for the ratio of Numbers not divisible by the first n primes,,"I was playing around with prime numbers, and specifically how many numbers we can exclude from an interval from being primes. It is easy to see, that after $2$ , the ratio of numbers is $1-\frac{1}{2}$ , as we know every second number to be divisible by $2$ and, as such be impossible to be a prime. After we include $3$ , the ratio would be $1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}$ , except that every number divisible by $6$ would be excluded once by the $\frac{1}{2}$ and a second time by the $\frac{1}{3}$ . Therefore in the actual ratio we have to add every sixth number again. So the actual ratio is $1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}$ . And naturally I wondered how this sequence continues once we include $5$ . However, the number of terms grows rapidly. This is because 1: We have to add back every tenth and fiveteenth number, again, as we would otherwise subtract them twice by the $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ or the $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{5}$ respectively. 2: We have to subtract every $30$ eth Number, as we subtract them thrice from the $2,3,5$ and add them back thrice from the $6,10,15$ , so as to not ignore these, we subtract them. This is the sequence I have arrived at, although I could be missing something $1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{15}-\frac{1}{30}$ Conjectured sequence If we look at the number of terms, the sequence $1,2,4,8$ appears, furthermore, if we look at the latter half of our sequence for the first 3 prime numbers $(-\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{15}-\frac{1}{30})$ , it is just the first half $(1-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6})$ multiplied by $-\frac{1}{5}$ . So here is my conjecture stated a bit more mathematically: Let $p_n$ be the $n$ -th prime number, $r(n)$ the ratio of natural numbers divisible by the first $n$ prime numbers to the natural numbers, then \begin{multline} r(0)=1,\\ r(n+1)=r(n)-\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}r(n)\\ =r(n)\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}\right)\\ =r(0)\cdot\left(1-\frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1-\frac{1}{p_2}\right)...\left(1-\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}\right)\\ =\prod_{i=1}^{n+1}\left(1-\frac{1}{p_i}\right) \end{multline} My question is: is this true?

The idea for solving this question is: First we will only work on the partial sum $S_n$ and once we find a closed form for it, we will limit $n$ to $\infty$ to find our answer. Notice that for example $\frac{3}{2^2}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{2}{2^2}$, knowing this, we can write $S_n$ a bit differently: $$S_n=(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{2^3}+\frac{1}{2^4}+...+\frac{1}{2^n})+\frac{2}{2^2}+\frac{4}{2^3}+\frac{6}{2^4}+...+\frac{2n-2}{2^n}$$ Notice that the part in the brackets is a finite sum that we can calculate, we know it converges to $1$ when $n$ approaches $\infty$ And now we can repeat the process again for what's not in the brackets and we can repeat this an infinite amount of times. And if we keep going like that, we will indeed see that the sequence of whats in the bracket is: $1,1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8}...$ and if we sum them all up it will converge to the desired outcome which is $3$.

The problem is, that for every hour of leave paid to an employee, they are entitled to accrue an additional 0.038462 hours of leave, so as they take leave, they also accrue leave, which in turn they are entitled to take. The problem is, this makes it very hard to work out how much leave to give them so that their leave balance comes to 0 To give an example, I have an employee that currently has 10 hours leave but wants to take 20 hours all up. Since he takes 10 hours leave, he will accrue 10 x 0.038462 in leave for that pay run. So he's actually is entitled to take 10.38462 hours leave.

It can be easily shown that, $$S_p-1=\binom{p}{1}S_{p-1}+\binom{p}{2}S_{p-2}+\ldots+\binom{p}{p-1}S_{1}+\binom{p}{p}S_0$$ This formula is already well known and I have already proven it. Then I had proven the following: $$\frac{S_p}{S_{p-1}}\sim Cp$$ where $C$ is some non-zero constant. Now I went on to trying to find a $C$ that would best approximate this series because then an explicit formula would result. So this is, $$C=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\frac{S_p}{S_{p-1}}-\frac{S_{p-1}}{S_{p-2}}}{p-(p-1)}=\frac{S_p}{S_{p-1}}-\frac{S_{p-1}}{S_{p-2}}$$ because $Cp$ approaches $\frac{S_p}{S_{p-1}}$ as $p\to\infty$ I add the limit and here is where my problem arises. That is, $$\lim_{p\to\infty}\left(\frac{S_{p}}{S_{p-1}}-\frac{S_{p-1}}{S_{p-2}}\right)$$ I can safely say that this limit will most likely go to $\frac{1}{\ln 2}$ as this is what occurs on Desmos and Wolfram when plotted; it is also the $C$ that can be seen on the OEIS that others have found.
