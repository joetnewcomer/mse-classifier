Question: Determine the general solution of the trigonometric equation:   $\sin\theta=3\cos\theta$ So the first thing I think of doing when seeing this is making sure either side has the same ratio. I can do this using co-ratios, so: $\sin\theta=3\sin(90^\circ-\theta)$ $\sin\theta=3\cos\theta$ From here I get stuck; there are no values to compute a reference angle with. The textbook gives the solution as: $\theta=71.6^\circ+k\cdot 180^\circ, k\in\mathbb{Z}$ Can anyone give me a hint? Thanks in advance! -Shaun","I'm a high school level maths student currently working through some exercises for the general solution of trigonometric equations and have come across this one that I am stuck on.

To give an idea how one would start it is by; Proof: I'm still unsure about the above or how the square root come about,"\omega = {\frac {\sin (P + Q) + i (1 - \cos (P + Q))} {(\cos P + \cos Q) + i (\sin P - \sin Q) }}  |\omega| = \tan \frac {P + Q} {2} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \arg(\omega) = Q  |\omega| = {\frac {\sqrt{\sin^2 (P + Q) + (1 - \cos (P + Q))^2}} 
{\sqrt{(\cos P + \cos Q)^2 + (\sin P - \sin Q)^2 }}} ","['calculus', 'trigonometry']"
98,Prove that $|\sin x-x |\le \frac{1}{6}|x|^3$,Prove that,|\sin x-x |\le \frac{1}{6}|x|^3,Prove that $|\sin x-x |\le \frac{1}{6}|x|^3$ I've been trying to solve this problem for the last hour but I just can't crack it. I know I'm supposed to use Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem somehow but can't figure out how. Edit: This problem is from chapter 4 of Foundations of Analysis by Taylor. The book hasn't covered Taylor series yet. I am supposed solve this using a method that is already covered. It is very likely that the intended solution involves the usage of Cauchy's form of the mean value theorem.,Prove that I've been trying to solve this problem for the last hour but I just can't crack it.
