2,How to prove these two sets are identical?,How to prove these two sets are identical?,,This is more a question of the methadology one should use to solve these type of questions: Say there is a set $V \subseteq X \subseteq Y$ and $U \subseteq Y$ such that  $$X \setminus V = U \cap X $$ Prove that $$ V = X\cap (Y \setminus U)$$ The easiest approach I found to prove these solutions is to simply draw a venn diagram that fits all the properties and then the equivalence becomes obvious but I don't think that is rigorous enough.

4,Countability of Collection of All Finite Subsets of a Countable Set,Countability of Collection of All Finite Subsets of a Countable Set,,"Let V be a countable set. Ok, first thing to say is that this isn't a question as to whether $S = \{ A \subseteq V \mid A \ \text{finite} \}$ is countable -- there are plenty of other duplicates on SE asking the same question! This question is regarding the legitimacy of a method that I've been thinking about. Wlog let $V$ be infinite, otherwise the result is trivial. Fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and consider $S_n = \{ A \subseteq V \mid |S| = n\}$. ($S_0 = \emptyset$.) For $n = 1$, this is just the set of singletons of $V$, and so is countable. For $n = 2$, this is just the set of pairs of $V$, and so, by the ""countable collection of countables is countable"" argument, is countable. For general $n \in \mathbb{N}$, consider $N \choose n$, which, for fixed $N \in \mathbb{N}$, is a polynomial in $n$. Since we can iterate the ""countable collection of countables is countable"" argument, we have countability for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. (That is to say, this follows since the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients of degree $n$ is countable.) Now, further we know that the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients is countable. Letting $P_n$ be the set of polynomials (with integer coefficients -- assume this whenever talking about polynomials) of degree $n$, we have that the set of all polynomials $P = \cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} P_n$. Similarly (in our above notation), $S = \cup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} S_n$. From this can we then deduce that $S$ is countable? My main concern is the following. If $|V| = N \in \mathbb{N}$ (so $V$ is finite), then $|S_n| = {N \choose n}$. Since the union is disjoint, we then have that $$|S| = \sum_{n=1}^N {N \choose n} = 2^N.$$ But $\aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}$. So if we just let $N \to \infty$ in the above equation, then naively we get $|S| = 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$, which says that $S$ is uncountable. Alternatively, we can think of it another way (very similar). Without considering polynomials, we can just say that $S_n$ is countable for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and we're summing/unioning over a countable set, and so the result follows from the ""countable collection of countable is countable"" argument. Any comments on this would be most appreciated. The 'proof' (if it is a proof) does seem to be fine to me (I'm pretty sure the concern mentioned above is just that if you do the rigorous maths then you'll find that you can't just swap the limits naively). However, in the many SE questions asking if $S$ is countable, everyone (that I've seen) tries to set up some function that is an injection to deduce the result. This is fine, if you can come up with the injection, but my above method seems much more intuitive. (There is one that has a similar method, but they claim that $S_n$ is finite for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and that's (a place) where their proof fell down.)","Let V be a countable set.

I came up with the following but I'm unsure if it's actual true. Just like the propositions-as-types interpretation for intuitionistic logic, one can give a propositions-as-sets interpretation for classical logic.  If the logical language consists of $\land,\lor,\Rightarrow,\bot$, we can interpret these symbols as the set operations $\times,\oplus,\rightarrow,\emptyset$ and a propositional formula $\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is valid iff we can prove (in set theory enriched by $\times,\oplus,\rightarrow,\emptyset$) that $\exists Y.Y\in\tilde\phi[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ for the corresponding set theoretical term $\tilde\phi$.

I thought maybe one could make precise what is meant by 'canonical inhabitant of $\phi$' by saying there exists a (set theoretical) formula $\chi[X_1,\dots,X_n,Y]$ such that we can prove: $$(\exists!

Then clearly $\tilde\phi[X]=\emptyset\rightarrow X$ equals $\{\emptyset\}$ (no matter what $X$ is because $\emptyset$ is an initial object in the category of sets) so it contains a very canonical inhabitant (i.e. this inhabitant doesn't even depend on $X$).

64,Cantor sets and drawing figure-8s in the plane,Cantor sets and drawing figure-8s in the plane,,"I know that the Cantor Set is uncountable (this is a well-known result ), so I know that there must be something wrong with the following method for counting its elements, but I'm not sure where the flaw is. I'll assume that the Cantor set in question is a subset of the interval $[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ obtained through iterative elimination of middle thirds . The point with coordinate $0$ is numbered $1$ , and the point with coordinate $1$ is numbered $2$ . After the first iteration, the middle third of the unit interval is deleted, and we find two more points that must be in the Cantor set. These are the points with coordinates $1/3$ and $2/3$ . Number them $3$ and $4$ , respectively. After the next iteration, there are four new endpoints of line segments that must now be counted. Number the points with coordinates $1/9$ , $2/9$ , $7/9$ and $8/9$ as $5$ , $6$ , $7$ , and $8$ , as depicted below. Every point in the unit interval must either not be in the Cantor set, or be the endpoint of a line segment at some finite iteration of the deletion process. But every such endpoint is numbered by the process above, so every point in the Cantor set should correspond to a non-negative integer, and vice versa. I think the problem is that there exist points that are in the Cantor set that are not endpoints of a line segment at some iteration, and so would not be counted. However, I can't think of an example of such a point ... I thought about this while musing over the following questions: Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting circles in the plane? (clearly yes, e.g. concentric circles with radii in $[0,1]$ ) Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting figure eights in the plane? (I think the answer is no, but I am not sure why) While thinking about the second of these, I considered a figure eight with two figure eights inside of it, one in each half, and two inside each of the halves of those , and so on: These figure eights are easily countable. Number the biggest one $1$ , the second biggest ones $2$ and $3$ , and so on. This is closely similar to how the points in the Cantor set are ""counted"" in the first part of this question. I'm dealing with two sets. One is the Cantor set; the other is the infinite set of nested figure eights, the first few of which are in the diagram above. The latter is clearly countable, while the former is ostensibly not. What is the difference between the two? Is there possibly some way to construct a set of figure eights with centers at points in the Cantor set so that these figure eights don't intersect? Would this be a way to draw an uncountable infinity of figure eights in the plane?

After the first iteration, the middle third of the unit interval is deleted, and we find two more points that must be in the Cantor set. These are the points with coordinates and . Number them and , respectively. After the next iteration, there are four new endpoints of line segments that must now be counted. Number the points with coordinates , , and as , , , and , as depicted below. Every point in the unit interval must either not be in the Cantor set, or be the endpoint of a line segment at some finite iteration of the deletion process. But every such endpoint is numbered by the process above, so every point in the Cantor set should correspond to a non-negative integer, and vice versa. I think the problem is that there exist points that are in the Cantor set that are not endpoints of a line segment at some iteration, and so would not be counted. However, I can't think of an example of such a point ... I thought about this while musing over the following questions: Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting circles in the plane? (clearly yes, e.g. concentric circles with radii in ) Is it possible to draw an uncountably infinite number of non-intersecting figure eights in the plane? (I think the answer is no, but I am not sure why) While thinking about the second of these, I considered a figure eight with two figure eights inside of it, one in each half, and two inside each of the halves of those , and so on: These figure eights are easily countable. Number the biggest one , the second biggest ones and , and so on. This is closely similar to how the points in the Cantor set are ""counted"" in the first part of this question. I'm dealing with two sets. One is the Cantor set; the other is the infinite set of nested figure eights, the first few of which are in the diagram above. The latter is clearly countable, while the former is ostensibly not. What is the difference between the two? Is there possibly some way to construct a set of figure eights with centers at points in the Cantor set so that these figure eights don't intersect? Would this be a way to draw an uncountable infinity of figure eights in the plane? If not, is there another way?","[0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R} 0 1 1 2 1/3 2/3 3 4 1/9 2/9 7/9 8/9 5 6 7 8 [0,1] 1 2 3","['elementary-set-theory', 'fractals']"

The proof I have, for the finite case, is an induction on the cardinality of the family F. Basis: |F| = 1, I.e. There is one set in the family. Since the family is finite, regardless of whether |X| for X in F is countable or finite, we can e.g. order X so that X has a Least element and that element will be the choice function on X (this follows from the fact that there exists a bijection between a finite or countable set and the naturals which are strictly ordered). .

To give an example, this is transitive: $\{(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)\}$ But this is not: $\{(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(3,4),(4,4)(4,1)\}$ But that is obviously because there isn't a $(3, 1)$ I can not see a fundamental difference between the two from the first example. Thank you for your help EDIT: Apparently, this also isn't transitive and I have no idea why: $R_5 = \{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)\}$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'relations']"

95,How to express a set of objects in the language of maths?,How to express a set of objects in the language of maths?,,"I am trying to describe a simple algorithm using the language of mathematics. But I am a programmer and used to think in terms of objects (as in object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design and object-oriented programming ). Here are the classes I have: A changeset represents a set of changes. Each change has an operation (either ""ADD"" or ""REMOVE"") and a statement (I think it does not matter here what a statement is). There are also some objects: Set<Statement> s0; Set<Statement> s1; Set<Statement> s2; ChangeSet c1; ChangeSet c2; c1 is derived from s0 and s1 by some function delta : c1 = delta(s0, s1) And so is c2 : c2 = delta(s0, s2) Now let's try to represent this in the language of maths: $$ \mathbb C_1 = \{ c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_1) $$ $$ \mathbb C_2 = \{ c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_2) $$ $$ c_{i,j} = (p_{i,j}, s_{i,j}) $$ $$ \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_i) = \{ (""-"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_0 \setminus S_i} \} \cup \{ (""+"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_i \setminus S_0} \} $$ where $p_{i,j}$ is an operation and $s_{i,j}$ is a statement. It looks pretty compact but there are two things that bother me: I had to replace an object with a pair of variables $(p_{i,j}, s_{i,j})$ because I was unsure how to address ""fields"" of objects in the language of maths. Now since they are not objects, they loose its ""type"", they are just ""pairs"". I had to replace sets with arrays with indices. So now I have to think about $\Bbb C_1$ and $\Bbb C_2$ as of a big matrix of values rather than two sets of objects. But this is only a part of problem. I have to use indices everywhere and, for example, when I want iterate over $\Bbb{S^- = S_1 \setminus S_2}$, while keeping having in memory the big matrix, I reluctantly write $s_j \in \Bbb S^-$. Is there anything I miss? Am I complicating things? Is there a way to operate true objects in the language of maths? So that I can write something like $$ \Bbb S^+ = \{ c.statement | c \in \Bbb C ( c.operation = ""+"" ) \} $$ instead of  $$ \Bbb S^+ = \{ s_i | c_i \in \Bbb C ( p_i = ""+"" ) \}. $$","I am trying to describe a simple algorithm using the language of mathematics. But I am a programmer and used to think in terms of objects (as in object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design and object-oriented programming ). Here are the classes I have: A changeset represents a set of changes. Each change has an operation (either ""ADD"" or ""REMOVE"") and a statement (I think it does not matter here what a statement is). There are also some objects: Set<Statement> s0; Set<Statement> s1; Set<Statement> s2; ChangeSet c1; ChangeSet c2; c1 is derived from s0 and s1 by some function delta : c1 = delta(s0, s1) And so is c2 : c2 = delta(s0, s2) Now let's try to represent this in the language of maths: $$ \mathbb C_1 = \{ c_{1,1}, c_{1,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_1) $$ $$ \mathbb C_2 = \{ c_{2,1}, c_{2,2}, \ldots \} = \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_2) $$ $$ c_{i,j} = (p_{i,j}, s_{i,j}) $$ $$ \delta(\mathbb S_0, \mathbb S_i) = \{ (""-"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_0 \setminus S_i} \} \cup \{ (""+"", s_{i,j}) \vert s_{i,j} \in \Bbb{S_i \setminus S_0} \} $$ where $p_{i,j}$ is an operation and $s_{i,j}$ is a statement. It looks pretty compact but there are two things that bother me: I had to replace an object with a pair of variables $(p_{i,j}, s_{i,j})$ because I was unsure how to address ""fields"" of objects in the language of maths. Now since they are not objects, they loose its ""type"", they are just ""pairs"". I had to replace sets with arrays with indices.
