I just started learning category theory and am very confused about the concept ""universal property"". I am not even sure whether my ""proof"" is a proof or is just a restating of the original problem. Here is a problem from Vakil's notes of Algebraic Geometry. Exercise 1.3.D. Verify that $A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$ satisfies the following universal property: $S^{-1}A$ is initial among $A$-algebras $B$ where every element of $S$ is sent to an invertible element in $B$. My attempt: I searched and found this question on MSE: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1816224/localization-and-the-universal-property?rq=1 . So I constructed my ""proof"" based on that: We consider a category $\mathscr{C}$ with objects as pairs of, e.g., $(S^{-1}A, A\xrightarrow{i_s} S^{-1}A), (B, A\xrightarrow{\pi_B} B), (C, A\xrightarrow{\pi_C} C)$. The objects are pairs whose first components are $A$-algebras, and second components are ring maps from $A$ to the corresponding $A$-algebras, in which elements from $S$ are sent to an invertible element. Notice that $S$ is in $A$. For any two objects $B, C$, the morphisms are ring maps between $B$ and $C$. We have the following diagram: We see that any map $\pi: A\rightarrow B$ where every element of $S$ is sent to an invertible element must factor uniquely through $i_s: A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$. My question: Could anyone verify my ""proof""? I am not sure how this universal property could be used. Edit: According to @Hoot's suggestion, I will define $\phi$ and prove that it is unique. Define $\phi: S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$ by $\phi(a/s)=\pi(a)\pi(s)^{-1}$, for $s\in S, a\in A$. We prove that $\phi$ is well-defined. Let $a_1/s_1=a_2/s_2$, i.e., $s(a_1s_2-a_2s_1)=0$ for some $s\in S$. This implies $\pi(a_1s_2-a_2s_1)=0$. We have $\phi(a_1/s_1)=\pi(a_1)\pi(s_1)^{-1}, \phi(a_2/s_2)=\pi(a_2)\pi(s_2)^{-1}$. Apparently they are equal. By some similar computations we can prove it is a ring homomorphism. It remains to show that $\phi$ is unique. Let $\psi: S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$ be another ring homomorphism, such that $\pi=\psi\circ i_s$. Then $\pi(a)=\psi(a)$ for all $a\in A$. Since it is homomorphism, $\psi(a/s)=\psi(a)\psi(s)^{-1}=\pi(a)\pi(s)^{-1}$. This shows that $\psi=\phi$. Another question: In the notes the author says every map $A\rightarrow B$ that sends elements in $S$ to an invertible element factors uniquely through $A\rightarrow S^{-1}A$. I'm still confused about this sentence. Shouldn't we say it factors uniquely through $S^{-1}A\rightarrow B$, since that is the unique universal map?

55,Singularities in (Elementary) Real Algebraic Geometry,Singularities in (Elementary) Real Algebraic Geometry,,"I've taken an introductory course in algebraic geometry, and am currently studying Sumio Watanabe's book, ""Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning Theory"".  In this book Watanabe gives a, possibly antiquated, definition of real algebraic singularities: A point $P$ on a curve $A$ is said to be nonsingular if there exist   open sets $U,V\in\mathbb{R}^d$ containing $P$ and an analytic isomorphism (bijective   function analytic both ways) $f:U\rightarrow V$ such that $$f(A\cap  U)=\{(x_1,x_2,...,x_r,0,0,...,0);x_i\in\mathbb{R}\}\cap V,$$ where $r$   is a nonnegative integer. So to gain some intuition for this definition, I took a look at the two curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$: \begin{align} &y^3-x^2=0\\ &x^2-(y+1)^3+(y+1)^2=0. \end{align} The first of these curves has a singularity at $(0,0)$, while the second one doesn't.  The strategy the book uses in its examples is basically to apply the identity function to $x$, and then project $y$ down onto the $x-$axis, in the following way: \begin{align} &f(x,y)=0\\ &u=x\\ &v=f(x,y) \end{align} Of course this depends on being able to invert the $v=f(x,y)$ function and solve for $y$.  And in fact this is what fails for $y^3-x^2=0$, since solving $v=y^3-x^2$ for $y$ gives us $y=\sqrt[3]{u^2+v}$, which is not analytic at $(0,0)$. So turning to the second equation, which is nonsingular at $(0,0)$, our second analytic function is $v=x^2-(y+1)^3+(y+1)^2$.  Solving this equation for $y$ involves finding the roots of a cubic polynomial, which is not feasible for me.  Thus if this second equation is to be nonsingular, then should I expect that one of these three roots will be a real-valued analytic function inside some open ball containing the origin, while the other two solutions will be complex-valued always with non-zero imaginary part?

Show that $f=g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are identical on a dense subset of $X$. I have been working for a while on this exercice, and made the following progress: We first introduce the notion of the diagonal $\triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n) \subset \mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. We say that $([x_0,\ldots,x_n], [y_0, \ldots, y_n]) \in \mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$ is in $\triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n)$ if and only if $[x_0,\ldots,x_n] = [y_0, \ldots, y_n]$. This condition can be neatly summarized by $$V( \ \{ \psi_{ij} = x_i y_j - x_i y_i \| 0 \leq i,j \leq n\} \ )$$ and it is clear that this is a closed subset. If $V \subset \mathbb{P}_k^n$ then $V \times V$ inherits its topology as a subset of $\mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. Therefore $$\triangle_V = \triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n) \cap (V \times V)$$ is closed in $V \times V$ since $\triangle(\mathbb{P}^n)$ is closed in $\mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. For this reason the special case can easily be reduced to the case where $Y = \mathbb{P}_k^n$. Notice that $\{ x \in X \mid f(x) = g(x) \}$ is the inverse image of $\triangle(Y)$ under the continuous mapping.  $$(f,g): X \to Y \times Y: x \mapsto (f(x),g(x))$$ Therefore this preimage is closed.

Show that $f=g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are identical on a dense subset of $X$. I have been working for a while on this exercice, and made the following progress: We first introduce the notion of the diagonal $\triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n) \subset \mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. We say that $([x_0,\ldots,x_n], [y_0, \ldots, y_n]) \in \mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$ is in $\triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n)$ if and only if $[x_0,\ldots,x_n] = [y_0, \ldots, y_n]$. This condition can be neatly summarized by $$V( \ \{ \psi_{ij} = x_i y_j - x_i y_i \| 0 \leq i,j \leq n\} \ )$$ and it is clear that this is a closed subset. If $V \subset \mathbb{P}_k^n$ then $V \times V$ inherits its topology as a subset of $\mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. Therefore $$\triangle_V = \triangle(\mathbb{P}_k^n) \cap (V \times V)$$ is closed in $V \times V$ since $\triangle(\mathbb{P}^n)$ is closed in $\mathbb{P}_k^n \times \mathbb{P}_k^n$. For this reason the special case can easily be reduced to the case where $Y = \mathbb{P}_k^n$. Notice that $\{ x \in X \mid f(x) = g(x) \}$ is the inverse image of $\triangle(Y)$ under the continuous mapping.  $$(f,g): X \to Y \times Y: x \mapsto (f(x),g(x))$$ Therefore this preimage is closed.

Question: What can we say about this $f \in S$ ? More concretely, can we decide when is it a zero divisor or even nilpotent?

From this we can conclude that for every $s \in S_1$ the element $f/s^d \in S_{(s)}$ (inside the degree- $0$ part of the localization) is nilpotent. And if I'm not missing something, then this would already suffice to show that initial $f$ is nilpotent as element in homogenoeus ring $S$ , as we have natural inclusion $S_{(s)} \subset S_s $ and inside the latter $f= (f/s^d) \cdot s^d$ is by above nilpotent, and so we can conclude that $f$ is nilpotent in $S$ . Firstly, is the argumentation correct? If yes, then we can answer the 3 questions as follows: For (1) we can only state that it's nilpotent, nothing more. Can we say something more in case (2) if the ideal $I$ is saturated? The case (3) seems to be more restructive: As $S_{(s)}$ is domain, this implies that $f/s^d$ is zero or equivtly that $s^d \cdot f=0$ (by univ prop of localization) for every $s \in S_1$ . But this already implies (since $S$ Noetherian) that $f \in I$ as $I$ is assumed to be saturated, so $f=0$ in $ S$ . Let's come back to my concern in If I'm haven't overseen some mistake in my reasonings, then it seems that the case (3) answers the question if for integral $X$ the homogeneous ring $S$ in construction is a domain: If not, there exist two (wlog homogeneous; otherwise take summands of highest degrees) nonzero $f,g \in S$ with $f \cdot g=0$ . Then, on level of topology (as a scheme carries an underlying top space) we have $X= \text{Proj} \ S= \text{Proj} \ S/(f \cdot g)= \text{Proj} \ S/(f) \cup \text{Proj} \ S/(g)$ . As $X$ irreducible, wlog $X=\text{Proj} \ S/(f)$ on level of topological spaces. Then applying case (3) from above we deduce $f=0$ . Does the argument work?

Especially, do we really need to to assume to be algebraically closed in the quoted Exercise as Hartshorne requires (that which is particularly gnawing in the story)","A X \mathbb{P}^r_A S:=S(X) X A[x_0, ..., x_r]/I I=I(X) X I(X) X \subset \mathbb{P}^r_k I^{\text{sat}} X f \in S_d \subset S f d S \to S/(f) \text{Proj} \ S/(f) \to \text{Proj} \ S  f \in S I \subset A[x_0, ..., x_r]  I f \in A[x_0, ..., x_r] i=0,1,...,r n_i  f \cdot x_i^{n_i} \in I f \in I I X A=k S f R f \in R R \to R/(f) f s \in S_1 f/s^d \in S_{(s)} 0 f S S_{(s)} \subset S_s  f= (f/s^d) \cdot s^d f S I S_{(s)} f/s^d s^d \cdot f=0 s \in S_1 S f \in I I f=0  S X S f,g \in S f \cdot g=0 X= \text{Proj} \ S= \text{Proj} \ S/(f \cdot g)= \text{Proj} \ S/(f) \cup \text{Proj} \ S/(g) X X=\text{Proj} \ S/(f) f=0 A=k f \in S k","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'schemes', 'graded-rings', 'projective-schemes']"
98,Background for Gross-Zagier paper,Background for Gross-Zagier paper,,"I have been reading the paper ""Heegner points and derivatives of $L$ -series"" by Gross and Zagier. Link to the paper. In section III of the paper, they use intersection theory to express a local height at a non-archimedean place in terms of an intersection product. I have been having trouble understanding the algebraic geometry in this section. So far I have been reading chapters 7 and 9 of Qing Liu's book ""Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves"", but it seems as though I will need to learn scheme theory in more technical detail in order to get anything out of it. I have read through the non-archimedean argument in Gross-Zagier's paper ""On singular moduli"", which can be regarded as a special case of the ""Heegner points and derivatives of $L$ -series"". This has helped motivate the use of Hom-sets between points of $X_0(N)$ , but doesn't seem to require the intersection theory arguments in the latter paper (maybe this is present in the form of Deuring's lifting theorem). Finally I will state my question. Where should I look in order to get the necessary background to understand these calculations?","I have been reading the paper ""Heegner points and derivatives of -series"" by Gross and Zagier.

Specifically, let $S$ be a closed Riemann surface, $G$ be the cyclic group of order $N$ , acting on $S$ by automorphisms and $\tilde{S} = S / G$ be the closed Riemann surface obtained by identifying those point on $S$ which are equivalent under the action of $G$ . Then, the lemma claims that if the number of branch points of covering map $\varphi : S \rightarrow \tilde{S}$ is $0$ , then the Riemann surface $S$ is conformally equivalent to $y^N = f(x)$ , where $f(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$ . Where can I find the reference for it or is there an obvious proof that I'm missing?","In K.Nakagawa's article ""On the orders of automorphisms of a closed Riemann surface"" there is Lemma 3, that doesn't have any proof or reference.
