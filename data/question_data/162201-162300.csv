An element of this $\sigma$ -algebra is called a Borel set. LEMMA (1): Let $x\in\mathbb{R}$ : then there exists both a decreasing sequence and an increasing sequence of rational numbers converging to $x$ . LEMMA (2): Every open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ can be written as a countable union of disjoint open intervals. Let $(a, b), a,b\in\mathbb{R}, a<b$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ .

From $[4]$ , $[5]$ , using the fact that $\sigma$ -algebras are closed under differences of sets we get $(-\infty,b-1]\cup [b,+\infty)\setminus (-\infty,b-1]=[b,+\infty)\in\mathcal{S}$ and similarly from $[3]$ and $[6]$ that $(-\infty,a]\cup [a+1,+\infty)\setminus [a+1,+\infty)=(-\infty, a]\in\mathcal{S}$ so it is also $(-\infty,a]\cup [b,+\infty)\in\mathcal{S}$ hence $(a,b)\in\mathcal{S}$ .

We observe that the sums in the definition of $T_F$ are made bigger if the additional subdivision points $x_j$ are added. Hence, if $a < b$ , the deinition of $T_F(b)$ is unaffected if we assume that $a$ is always one of the subdivision points. It follows that $$T_F(b) - T_F(a) = \sup\{\sum_{1}^{n}|F(x_j) - F(x_{j-1}|:n\in\mathbb{N},a = x_0 < \ldots < x_n = b\}$$ Thus $T_F$ is an increasing function with values in $[0,\infty]$ .

Since $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}I_n$ , being the union of open sets, is an open set, we know that we can write it as the disjoint union of other open intervals $J_n$ , which must thus also be bounded so $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}I_k=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} J_k$ , $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\ell(J_k)=|\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} J_k|= |\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}I_k|<|A|+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}<\infty$ and since $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\ell(J_k)$ is convergent there must be $N\geq 1$ such that $\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}\ell(J_k)<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ thus if we take $G=\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}J_n$ we have $$|A\setminus G|+|G\setminus A|=|A\setminus\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}J_n|+|(\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}J_n)\setminus A|\leq |\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}J_n\setminus\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}J_n|+|\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}J_n\setminus A|\overset{A\in\mathcal{L},|A|<\infty}{=}|\bigcup_{n=N+1}^{\infty}J_n|+|\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}J_n|-|A|<|\bigcup_{n=N+1}^{\infty}J_n|+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\leq\frac{\varepsilon}{2}+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}=\varepsilon$$ as desired. $\Leftarrow$ By hypothesis we know that for every $n\geq 1$ there exist $j_n$ bounded disjoint open intervals $G_{1_n}, G_{2_n},\dots, G_{j_n}$ such that $G_{n}=\bigcup_{k=1}^{j_n}G_{k_n}$ and $|A\setminus G_n|+|G_n\setminus A|<\frac{1}{n}$ .

Let $osc(f,c,r)=\sup|f(x)-f(y)|$ , where   the supremum is taken over all $x,y\in J\cap I(c,r)$ , and define the oscillation of $f$ at $c$ by $osc(f,c)=\underset{r\rightarrow 0}{\lim}osc(f,c,r)$ . Clearly, $f$ is continuous   at $c\in J$ if and only if $osc(f,c)=0$ . Prove that for every $\epsilon>0$ , the set of points $c$ in $J$ such that $osc(f,c)\geq \epsilon$ is compact. My Proof Attempt: Proof. Let the assumptions be as above. Let $\epsilon > 0$ . Define \begin{equation*} D_\epsilon=\{c\in J: osc(f,c)\geq \epsilon\} \end{equation*} It suffices to show that $D_\epsilon$ is closed as any closed subset of a compact set,  in this case namely $J$ , is also a compact set. Let $(x_n)_n\subset D_\epsilon$ such that $x_n\rightarrow x\in J$ . We will prove that $x\in D_\epsilon$ and, thus, $D_\epsilon$ would be closed. Claim : Since $x_n\in D_\epsilon$ , that implies that for sufficiently small $\varrho$ , \begin{equation*} osc(f,x_n,\varrho)\geq \epsilon \end{equation*} We will prove this claim by the following: Let $r>r'>0$ and $x\in J$ , then $J\cap I(x,r')\subset J\cap I(x,r)$ . This means that $osc(f,x,r)\geq$ $osc(f,x,r')$ since $osc(f,x,r)$ is defined to be the supremum over the set $\{d(f(x),f(y)): x,y\in J\cap I(x,r)\}$ . But any $x,y\in J\cap I(x,r')$ must also be in $J\cap I(x,r)$ . Thus, $osc(f,x,r)$ cannot increase as $r$ is made smaller. If $osc(f,x)\geq \epsilon$ , It cannot be that for ""really small"" $r>0$ that $osc(f,x,r)<\epsilon$ . Because then the limit cannot be $\geq \epsilon$ . This proves the Claim . Now, given any $r>0$ , either $(x-\frac{r}{2},x)\subset J\cap I(x,r)$ or $(x,x+\frac{r}{2})\subset J\cap I(x,r)$ , or both. WLOG, suppose $(x-\frac{r}{2},x)\subset J\cap I(x,r)$ and denote it as $I$ .  Then $\exists N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n\geq N,$ it follows that $x_n\in I$ .  As $I$ is open, we can choose $\varrho'$ sufficiently small such that $B_{\varrho'}(x_n)\subset I$ . Set $\rho=max\{\varrho, \varrho'\}$ . Then \begin{equation*} osc(f,x,r)\geq osc(f,x_n,\rho)\geq \epsilon \end{equation*} Since we choose $N$ and $\rho$ for any given $r>0$ ,  it follows that $osc(f,x)\geq \epsilon$ and $x\in D_\epsilon$ . This completes our proof. Any corrections of the proof or comments on style are very much appreciated.

97,Lebesgue integral of ${x^2}$,Lebesgue integral of,{x^2},"I am having trouble calculating the Lebesgue integral of ${x^2}$ over ${]0,1]}$ . I followed the instructions from my college lessons and constructed a sequence ${f_n}:=\sum_{k=1}^{n*2^n}\frac{k-1}{2^n}*\chi{}_{A_{n,k}}$ with ${A_{n,k}:=\{ \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{2^n}} \leq x < \sqrt{\frac{k}{2^n}} \}}$ . ${\lambda(f)}$ is equal to ${sup_{n\in N}\lambda(f_n)}$ , so I calculated $\lambda(f_n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n*2^n}\frac{k-1}{2^n} * (\sqrt{\frac{k}{2^n}} - \sqrt{\frac{k-1}{2^n}})$ . However, I don't see how this is going to be equal to ${\frac{1}{3}}$ , which would be the result of a Riemann integral. Can anyone spot a mistake or point me in the right direction?","I am having trouble calculating the Lebesgue integral of over .

98,Every finite measure on a metric space is regular,Every finite measure on a metric space is regular,,"let $(X,d)$ be a metric space with the Borel $\sigma$ -algebra.
