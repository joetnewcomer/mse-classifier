I am only allowed to use pythagorean, quotient, and reciprocal identities: $$\frac{\tan \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} = \sec \theta \csc\theta(1-\cos \theta)$$ I've tried converting $\tan \theta$ to $\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$ and such, but could only get it simplified down to $\frac{\tan \theta}{\cos \theta + 1}$ on the LHS. As for the right, I tried a common denominator and ended up with $$\frac{1-\cos \theta}{\cos \theta \sin \theta}$$ but couldn't see how I could go further from there.","I've been trying to prove this for a while, to no avail.

My goal is ultimately to construct a function g(x, S, T) that maps f to the range [S, T]. My strategy is to first compute the range of f, then scale it to the range [0,1], then scale that to the range [S, T]. Ideally I would like to be able to do this for an arbitrary number of waves, although to keep things simple I'm willing to be satisfied with 2 if it's the easiest route. Numerical methods welcome, although an explicit solution would be preferable.","Suppose I'm given a function f(x) = sin(Ax + B) + sin(Cx + D) is there a simple (or, perhaps, not-so-simple) way to compute the range of this function?

My first approach was to somehow write the given expression only in terms of the given $\cot\frac{\alpha}{2}$ and just put in the value $\left(-\dfrac{3}{2}\right)$ . Now I don't think that's possible because we have constants (4 and 2).
