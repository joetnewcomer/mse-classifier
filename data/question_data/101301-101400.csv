4,Is it possible to capture a light ray in a solar panel?,Is it possible to capture a light ray in a solar panel?,,"A while ago I was wondering how we could use mathematics to increase the efficiency of solar panels. The kind of mathematics I was thinking about in particular was Dynamical Billiards . Though I think it is improbable that it is currently technologically feasible to create the solar panel I am thinking about, I guess the following question could be interesting from a mathematical point of view. We first need some definitions: An $(k+l)$ -setting is a collection of two sets of points in $\mathbb{R^d}$ , $\{n_1,...,n_k \}, \{m_1,...,m_l \}$ such that each of the points $m_i \in \{m_1,...,m_{l-1} \}$ is connected with the point $m_{i+1}$ , by some continuous function (the continuous function may differ for each pair of points $(m_i,m_{i+1})$ ). For example, this is an $(k+l)$ -setting in $\mathbb{R^2}$ : I hope it's somewhat readable. In this case, we have $k=2$ and $l=5$ . Furthermore, we say that a $(k+l)$ -setting is good , if it is possible create a circle, such that the points $m_1,...,m_l$ are in the circle, but the points $n_1,...,n_k$ are not in the circle. If a $(k+l)$ -setting isn't good , it's bad . For example: Please notice that the first example of a $(k+l)$ -setting is bad . No matter how you draw the circle, the point $n_2$ is always contained in it. Now, the point of these definitions is that I would like to launch a light rays from the the points $n_1,...,n_k$ , that bounces against the continuous functions. These continuous functions act as a mirror, causing the light ray to reflect according to the laws of reflection . We assume that the light ray loses no energy with each reflection, thereby maintaining its intensity on it whole course. The continuous functions that act as a boundary of the ""solar panel"" aren't affected by a reflection either. Question 1: Does there exist a good $(1+l)$ -setting in $\mathbb{R^2}$ , such that we can send a light ray from point $n_1$ into the circle that encloses the points $m_1,...,m_l$ , in such a way that the light ray never leaves the circle?

Question 2.2: What about the case $k>1$ ? Question 2.3: What about the case $d>2$ ?

It has occurred to me that this problem is, of course, restricted to cases in which angle XOZ is of fewer than 60 degrees (as at 60 degrees, XYZ becomes a line segment, and above 60 degrees, no arc XYZ of length <= r can exist. It has also occurred to me that this problem could also be solved by defining some point P on OA such that a circle D with centerpoint P and which runs through X (and Z) exists, where the length of the arc XZ on circle D is r, but I also have no idea how to do that. Diagram EDIT: A related question of interest would be to define the function which describes the length of the line OY relative to the length of OX or OZ (ie: 'r'), and the angle of XOZ.  There would, naturally, be two valid values of OY, as indicated by @RossMillikan, one for a Y inside the circle, and one for a Y outside the circle.",,"['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'circles', 'angle', 'arc-length']"

Explanations like ""map from Euler angles is not a covering map for rotation space"" sounds good, but still doesn't reveal the reason. Then, I've read Wikipedia once again and saw this: ""Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z, the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves."" And then it hit me. When I was looking at all the pictures from all the articles and books, I saw something like this: And I thought, that Euler angles are based on co-moving frame  (so did a couple of my friends I asked, for that matter). But they are not! And from that moment everything seemed obvious! If one axes is global and two others are co-moving, then they can become aligned and we have a gimbal lock. So, here are my questions: Am I right at all, and this is the basic reason for gimbal lock in Euler angles? Will any rotation representation based on 3 orthogonal axes from one frame be gimbal-lock-free? Not only quaternions, but rotational matrices for example?

The villages in our country are randomly located (independently and uniformly) with an average of $1$ village per square mile. Our village is in the middle of a very large country, such that my uncle could not possibly reach the border within one year. Here is an example of what the first two weeks of his journey could look like. I haven't heard from my uncle since he left, and I don't have a map. How far away do you reckon he is now? That is, What is the expectation of his distance (as the crow flies) from our village? My attempt I have only been able to get a crude approximation, $\frac14\sqrt{365\pi}\approx8.47$ miles, by making the following two assumptions. Assume his journey is effectively just like a $2D$ random walk with constant step size $\lambda$ , where $\lambda$ is defined as the expected step size of his actual journey. Assume $\lambda=$ expected nearest neighbor distance in a $2D$ Poisson process with intensity $1$ . Under the second assumption, $\lambda=\frac12$ . Proof: If $X$ is the distance to a village's nearest neighbor, then the density function is $f(x)=2\pi xe^{-\pi x^2}$ , so $\mathbb{E}(X)=\int_0^\infty xf(x)\mathrm dx=\frac12$ . Then under the first assumption, my uncle's expected distance from our village is $\frac{\lambda}{2}\sqrt{365\pi}\approx8.47$ . I suspect the first assumption causes an underestimate: my uncle never revisits a village, so his path involves less ""back-tracking"" than a $2D$ random walk. The second assumption definitely causes an underestimate, because usually my uncle's step size is greater than the nearest neighbor distance.

The triangle has the following properties: $\angle ABC = 90^{\circ}$, $B=(r\cos(\alpha), t\sin(\alpha))$, $A=(-\sqrt{r^2\cos^2(\alpha) + t^2\sin^2(\alpha)},0)$, $C=(\sqrt{r^2\cos^2(\alpha) + t^2\sin^2(\alpha)},0)$, where $\alpha = \angle BOC$ and $r,t$ some arbitrary real numbers. Now I am going to let Geogebra draw trace of the segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}$ while $\alpha$ changes from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ for the following cases: In this case $r=t=1$. Point $B$ changes location whereas the points $A$ and $C$ stay the same because $$\sqrt{r^2\cos^2(\alpha) + t^2\sin^2(\alpha)}=\sqrt{r^2\cos^2(\alpha) + r^2\sin^2(\alpha)}=r$$ It can easily be verified that by interpolation the traces lead to a semi-circle of an area $\pi r^2/2$. In this case $r=1$, $t=1.5$; as you can verify by the equations, the points $A,B,C, O$ change location. Particularly the point $B$ moves on an ellipse. Finally, let's come to the problem: I tried but couldn't calculate the area beneath the traces like the first case for the second case. How can I formulate the area?

What I have so far: For a spiral r = a + b $\theta$, I used the information from this page to find that the cartesian slope at any point (r, $\theta$) is equal to $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{b\sin\theta\space+\space(a + b\theta)\cos\theta}{b\cos\theta\space-\space(a + b\theta)\sin\theta}$$ From here, I could use point-slope to find the equation of a tangent line at any point, but how do I go about finding the proper lengths of the handles (i.e. the positions of the middle two points) for the curve? Or would an approximation with circular arc segments be better/easier/faster?

I am looking for a practical way to detect and remove the inner ""pockets"" that appear. The output should be a continuous curve with the self-intersection replaced by a corner point. My curves are actually cubic arcs, but I work with flattening and discrete points, so one can see the curve as a smooth polyline. In a variant of the question, the offset is also varying along the curve. Update : There is a straightforward way to detect the cusps: they arise where the radius of curvature equals the offset distance. In the discrete setting, the osculating circle can be approximated by the circumscribing circle of three consecutive vertices. In the figure, you see offset vertices, which are in red when the estimated curvature is smaller than the offset. This principle allows to find evidence of self-intersections. I suspect that the ""ladder"" formed by the initial polyline and the corresponding offsetted points can help find the intersection efficiently.","When you compute offset curves (also called parallel curves ), by offsetting a fixed distance along the normals to a given curve, the resulting curve self-intersects when the offset distance exceeds the radius of curvature (see below).

60,"Intuitively, why are there 4 classical Lie groups/algebras?","Intuitively, why are there 4 classical Lie groups/algebras?",,"I would like to understand the big picture in mathematics.  Lie groups and Lie algebras seem to play a central role in bridging analysis and algebra.  I'm curious to understand, intuitively, why there are 4 classical Lie groups/algebras $A_{n},B_{n},C_{n},D_{n}$ and what are their various natures. $A_{n}$ special linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak {sl}_{n+1}$ $B_{n}$ odd-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra $\mathfrak {so}_{2n+1}$ $C_{n}$ symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak {sp}_{2n}$ $D_{n}$ even-dimensional special orthogonal Lie algebra $\mathfrak {so}_{2n}$ These writings raise my curiosity: Each of the four types $W, S, H, K$ of simple primitive Lie algebras $(L, L_{0})$ correspond to the four most important types of geometries of manifolds: all manifolds, oriented manifolds, symplectic and contact manifolds. Victor Kac , page 20. Whenever we pick a Dynkin diagram and a field we get a geometry : $A_{n}$ projective, $B_{n}$ $D_{n}$ conformal, $C_{n}$ symplectic. John Baez, in his blog. John Baez, in writing about the octonions, combines the orthogonal Lie algebras/groups so as to have three families. These arise naturally as symmetry groups of projective spaces over $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{H}$, respectively. @JakobH and @arctic-tern discuss that at this post . I imagine that I could study the associated Weyl groups and the infinite families of polytopes (simplexes, cross-polytopes, hypercubes, demicubes) which they are symmetry groups for.  I write my thoughts about that here .  I imagine that I should study the bilinear and sesquilinear forms as described in this Wikipedia article on the classical groups . Concretely, I've been looking at the Dynkin diagrams and learning how they relate to the Cartan matrices and the orthogonal bases used to describe the root systems.  The Dynkin diagrams are, in each case, chains that differ only at one end.  The links in the chain show that two fundamental roots are not orthogonal but differ by 120 degrees. I think the associated Cartan matrix can be thought of as describing the looseness in the root system, that is, the number of times that a root $\alpha$ can be added to $-\beta$ and stay within the root system. The Cartan matrix needs to describe an independent basis and thus needs to be nondegenerate with determinant nonzero, and in fact, we can write the Cartan matrix as $D\cdot S$ where $S$ is positive-definite. We can thereby show that if the Dynkin diagram grows in certain ways, for example, if it forms a cycle, then the determinant will become zero, the system will collapse. The determinant of the $n\times n$ Cartan matrix for a chain grows by the recursion formula $d_{n+1}=2d_{n}-d_{n-1}$, which is to say, $d_{n}=(d_{n-1}+d_{n+1})/2$. In the case of $A_{n}$ the initial conditions are $d_{1}=2$ and $d_{2}=3$ so it grows further $4,5,6...$.  But in the case of $B_{n}$ and $C_{n}$ we have $d_{1}=2$ and $d_{2}=2$ and so the determinants stay constant $2,2,2...$ and likewise for $D_{n}$ we have $4,4,4...$  The point is that the one end of the chain constrains what is possible at the other end of the chain.  The constraint is given by the fact that the wrong link at the end will make the whole system collapse.  It seems like a system for propagating a signal or for describing entanglement. But what I'm trying to understand is how to explain the four possible options for the Dynkin diagrams and what they imply about the characteristics of the Lie algebras/groups.  I am trying to explore the relationship between the Cartan matrices and the fundamental roots $\left \{  e_{i}-e_{i+1} | 1\leq i < n\right \}$ with each diagram distinguished by an additional root as follows: $A_{n}: e_{n}-e_{n+1}$ $B_{n}: e_{n}$ $C_{n}: 2e_{n}$ $D_{n}: e_{n-1}+e_{n}$ Each of these new roots maintains an independent system of roots but the cases $B_{n}, C_{n}, D_{n}$ ""economize"" and thereby compromise the options for expanding the system. Finally, I'm noticing based on what I've read at Wikipedia about positive-definite matrices that the formula $z^{\mathrm{T}}Sz=0$, with $D\cdot S$ equalling the Cartan matrix as discussed above, seems to work like a formula in logic. For example, for $A_{2}$ we get $z_{1}^{2}+(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}+z_{2}^{2}=0$ forcing $z_{1}=0,z_{1}=z_{2},z_{2}=0$, which means that the vector $z=0$. Whereas for a cycle we could get  $(z_{1}-z_{2})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{3})^{2}+(z_{3}-z_{1})^{2}=0$ allowing a degenerate, nonzero solution $z_{1}=z_{2}=z_{3}$. Setting $S = \begin{pmatrix} k & \frac{-1}{k}\\  \frac{-1}{k} & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ to handle the cases $A_{2} (k=1), B_{2} (k=2), G_{2} (k=3)$, we get the equation $(1-\frac{k}{4})z_{2}^2+k(z_{1}-\frac{z_{2}}{2})^2=0$ which forces us to have solutions $z_{2}=0$ and $z_{1}=z_{2}/2$ and also shows that we we will have degenerate solutions for $k\geq 4$.

I was looking into the proof that there are only five Platonic solids in Basic Concepts of Algebraic Topology by F.H. Croom at page 29, Theorem 2.7. To clarify, We define a Platonic solid as a simple, regular polyhedron homeomorphic to $S^{2}$ . We define a simple polyhedron to be a polyhedron that does not self-intersect itself. We define a regular polyhedron to be a polyhedron whose faces are regular polygons all congruent to each other and whose local regions near the vertices are all congruent to each other. Using homology theory, one can prove that the Euler formula $V-E+F=2$ must hold for Platonic solids. Then by using Euler's formula and invoking a counting argument, we find that there are five possible tuples $(V, E, F)$ . This is a beautiful proof, but I am unsatisfied with a question: How do we know there can't be two non-similar Platonic solids that have the same $(V, E, F)$ -tuple? Almost all sources I've looked at seem to assume it is obvious that two Platonic solids with the same $(V, E, F)$ -tuple are similar, and it is not obvious to me.

Edit 1: It's not completely clear, but it seems like the definition I used for ""regular polyhedra"" is different than the one commonly used.

One can show that any two Platonic solids that have the same $(V, E, F)$ -tuple must be combinatorically equivalent. However, in order for the theorem to apply, we need to show that our Platonic solids are convex. I can't seem to think of any rigorous argument for why the Platonic solids have to be convex.

95,Determining the point from which the most area in a polygon is visible,Determining the point from which the most area in a polygon is visible,,"I am wondering about the following problem: Given a polygon and the set of points $S$ inside it, what are the point(s) in $S$ from which the most area in $S$ is visible? Furthermore, what is the maximum visible area? Here, I define $q$ to be visible from $p$ if the line segment between $p$ and $q$ is contained in $S$. This intends to capture the intuitive idea of what points in a room are visible when standing somewhere in the room. For example, in the figure below, the dark blue area is visible from point P, at the center of the top left quarter. The light blue area is not. While the answer for any star-shaped domain is clear, finding the answer for arbitrary polygons seems difficult. Question: How can we find the solution to the problem for a given polygon?

96,Bathroom floor tiles,Bathroom floor tiles,,"Recently I was looking at the tiles on my bathroom floor.  They are small square tiles about a square cm each arranged in a grid.  They come in two colors, the majority of them are a light brown while a select few of them are a darker brown.  Since the color scheme of my bathroom is pretty awful we'll just call them black and white (with white being the more abundant color). While I was looking at the tiles I was looking for four tiles that formed a the points of a parallelogram.  To my dismay there were none (I spent much more time than I care to admit verifying this fact).  So I started a new game, I would try to see what tiles I could make black without disturbing this property.  Soon I began to wonder how many tiles I could could be black in my bathroom while maintaining this property.  I found this a pretty daunting task because there quite a few tiles in my bathroom, so I downsized.  First I worked it out with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 bathrooms.  These were pretty easy you can fit 1 tile in a 1 by 1 and 3 in a 2 by 2. 3 by 3 is a little more difficult I was able to determine 5 tiles could be fit. Proof: Let us for a moment just consider the following parallelograms: (the parallelograms with corners in the top and bottom row) This will require at least 2 white tiles in these rows to break all of these parallelograms, and unless there are more than 2 we need one in the center column. We can make an identical argument for the first and last columns , meaning that we need at least 3 white tiles in the outer ring (corners can be shared between the columns and row but centers cannot). Originally I made a more complex argument involving a lot of the parallelograms here, but I think it is a little more appropriate to brute force it from here. Here are all the ways that we can have three white tiles that satisfy the properties stipulated above: I have shaded the parallelograms that can be made from black tiles in red.  As we can see all 3 of the possibilities fail. Since none of these pass we know that there are at least 4 white tiles.  Luckily for us I found some solutions with 4 white tiles that do work so we can stop here: This proof does not scale up to 4 or larger squares very well or at all.  It feels barely more elegant brute forcing the problem and I fear that it would take me hours to come up with a proof on a 4 by 4. As Rahul pointed out and Jaap Scherphuis expanded upon we can create a lower bound for the number of black tiles that can fit on the floor at $2n-1$ (or $m+n-1$ for rectangular floors) by filling in two of the edges.  Jaap was kind enough to do a programatic search and found that this lower bound is optimal up to $7\times 7$, however no one has yet proven that $2n-1$ is the best for all squares. What methods might I use to solve larger or general cases of this problem? Is the lower bound always the best way?","Recently I was looking at the tiles on my bathroom floor.
