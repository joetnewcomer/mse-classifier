12,Why geometrically irreducible quartic curves in projective plane corresponds to an open subset of projective space of dimension 14,Why geometrically irreducible quartic curves in projective plane corresponds to an open subset of projective space of dimension 14,,"Here's exercise 9.5G from Ravi Vakil's Foundation of algebraic geometry Recall that the quartic curves in $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ are parametrized by   a $\mathbb{P}^{14}_k$. Show that the points of $\mathbb{P}^{14}_k$   corresponding to geometrically irreducible curves form an open subset.   Explain the necessity of the modifier “geometrically” (even if $k$ is   algebraically closed). It is also remarked that the dimension $2$ and degree $4$ can be replaced by other numbers. I think irreducible curves here mean irreducible and reduced curves. My first question is why the abverb ""geometrically"" is needed? A homogeneous polynomial of degree corresponds corresponds to an reducible or non-reduced closed subscheme if and only if the polynomial is reducible, which means that the polynomial is the product of two quadratic polynomial or a product of a linear polynomial and a cubic, and these should correspond to two closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^{14}_k$ since the map between two projective variety is proper (but this fact has not been proved before this exercise, so is there any other way to see this?), and thus the complement of their union, which corresponds to irreducible quartic curves, is open. It seems that this argument works without the term ""geometrically"". My second question is how to do the question when the term ""geometrically"" is added.

Let $J=\langle x^2+y^2+z^2, xy+yz+xz\rangle$; identify $V(J)$ and $I(V(J))$. The question did not specify the field. It is easy to see that in $\mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$, $V(J)=\{(0,0,0)\}$ and $I(V(J))=\langle x,y,z\rangle$. Consider it in $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$. From the defining equations, I got $x+y+z=0$. Substituting $x=-y-z$ into $x^2+y^2+z^2$, we get $y^2+yz+z^2=0$, this is equivalent as $(y+\frac{1}{2}z)^2+\frac{3}{4}z^2=0$.

Ultimately, I want to solve a Mittag-Leffler problem on this $X$, namely to construct a particular meromorphic function with prescribed principal parts. First, I want to find the least positive $n$ such that $h^{0}(nP)>1$ (where $h^{0}$ gives the dimension of the zeroth cohomology group). Then, using this value of $n$, I want to find an explicit rational function $f(x,y)$ such that $f \in H^{0}(X, \mathcal{O}_{D})$ where $D=nP$. I think I could solve this first by showing $P=(0,1)$ is a Weierstrass point on $X$. That is, $P$ is Weierstrass if $h^{0}(gP)=1$ or in our case $h^{0}(2P)=1$. Equivalently, we can apply Riemann-Roch for the condition $h^{0}(K-2P)=0$, i.e. no holomorphic 1-form vanishes to order to at $P$. If $P$ is Weierstrass, then we can easily get our value of $n$.

But even if they are complete, so we have the system $|A|$ with $A$ divisor on $C$, with $\deg A=d\geq2$, and $h^0(A)=2$. Then why is it base point free? Let $P\in C$. We need to show $h^0(A-P)=h^0(A)-1=1$. Riemann-Roch gives  $$h^0(A-P)\geq d-g.$$ Now I'm stuck here. From Hurwitz's formula we get $d=\frac{\deg R}{2}+1-g$, where $R$ is the ramification divisor of the morphism, but I don't see how this may help.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-curves']"
