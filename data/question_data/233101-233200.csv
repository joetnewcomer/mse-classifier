We can form the disjoint union $$\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha} = \left\{(x, \alpha) \ | \ \alpha \in A \ \text{and } \ x \in X_{\alpha}\right\}.$$ Now my question is what does $X' \sqcup \left(\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}\right)$ equal (as a set?), because based on the definition of the disjoint union I see two approaches to form the disjoint union of the above. Approch 1 Set $X_1 = X'$ and $X_2 = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$, and let the indexing set $I = \{1, 2\}$. Then $$\bigsqcup_{i \in I} X_i = X' \sqcup \left(\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}\right) = \left\{(x, i) \ | \ i\in I \ \text{and } \ x \in X_{i}\right\}$$ Now let $\phi_i : X_i \to \bigsqcup_{i \in I}X_{i}$ be the canonical embedding defined by $\phi_i(x) = (x, i)$. Now pick $p \in X_2 = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$, then we have $p = (q, \alpha)$ for some $q \in X_{\alpha}$ and $\alpha \in A$. Then $\phi_2(p) = ((q, \alpha), 2)$ and for $p \in X_1 = X'$ we have $\phi_1(p) = (p, 1)$. This doesn't seem desirable and I think it defeats the purpose or the point of having the disjoint union, but it seems to be logically correct (I think) based on the the definition of a disjoint union  above. Approach 2 On the other hand we can extend the indexing set $A$ by setting $X^{'} = X_{\beta}$ and setting a new indexing set to be $A' = A \cup \{\beta\}$ and then we'd have $$X' \sqcup \left(\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}\right) = \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A'} X_{\alpha} = \left\{(x, \alpha) \ | \ \alpha \in A' \ \text{and } \ x \in X_{\alpha}\right\}$$ Again let  $\phi_{\alpha} : X_{\alpha} \to \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A'}X_{\alpha}$ be the canonical embedding defined by $\phi_{\alpha}(x) = (x, \alpha)$.

This seems to be desirable for the disjoint union because we only have an ordered pair, instead of a $3$-tuple above, but I don't think that it is logically sound. Which of the approaches above is correct? Also I think that the main reason for the discrepency is that I have probably failed to take assosciativity into account for approach $2$ above, for example I'm assuming approach $2$ holds if we have $$X' \sqcup \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$$ So with regards to assosciativity, does it hold that for sets, $X, Y, Z$ we have $X \sqcup (Y \sqcup Z) \neq (X \sqcup Y) \sqcup  Z$?

This is what I understand: -A relation on a set $A$ is a subset $C$ of the cartesian product $A \times A$. -A relation $xCy$ is read as $(x, y) \in C$ -A relation is reflexive if $xCx$ for every $x$ in A. Now I can think of the plane that the two points are in as the cartesian product $\Bbb{R} \times \Bbb{R}$. So I will have shown that the relation is reflexive if I can show $xCx$ for every $x$ in $\Bbb{R}$. But how do I show this? Doesn't $xCx$ imply that $(x,x) \in C$? How does this $x$ relate to $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ in the stated problem? I don't think we are saying that all points where the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are equal are equivalent? I get that $y_0 = x_0^2$ is a parabola, and that we are describing parabolas in some way, but somehow it still seems unclear. Suppose the problem had said our points were equivalent if $y_0 - x_0^2$ = $2y_1 - x_1^2$. What would change?",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'relations']"

Multi-images can also be defined in a more algebraic way. Given a function $f : A \rightarrow B$, we get an induced function $\mathbb{N}\langle f \rangle : \mathbb{N}\langle A \rangle \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\langle B\rangle$ by assuming $\mathbb{N}$-linearity and agreement with $f$ when restricted to $A$. Then the multi-image of $f$ is $$\mathbb{N}\langle f\rangle \left(\sum_{a \in A} \langle a \rangle\right).$$ This sum makes sense because $A$ is finite. Abusing notation a bit, we can write $f$ instead of $\mathbb{N}\langle f \rangle$, and we can write $A$ in place of that sum, in which case the multi-image can be denoted $f(A)$, so long as we tell the reader what we're doing. Furthermore, if we allow multisets to be infinite, we don't have to assume that $A$ and $B$ are finite. At this level of generality, the above paragraph continues to make sense, so long as we replace commutative monoids with complete monoids , replacing ordinary linearity with infinitary linearity, and replacing the initial semiring $\mathbb{N}$ with the initial monoid object in the category of complete monoids . The multi-image construction can be seen as a de-categorification of the operation that replaces each function $f : A \rightarrow B$ with the corresponding slice of $B$. Now in my opinion, multi-images are a very natural construction. For example, injectivity and surjectivity can be decided from the multi-image alone (compare with ordinary images, which can only detect surjectivity.) However, I can't find any information about them online, and the term ""multi-image"" seems not to get any hits. Question. Do multi-images have an accepted name, and if so, where can I learn more about them?

If $(Y,\leq)$ and $(Y',\leq ')$ are elements of $\Omega$, we say that $(Y,\leq)$ is an \emph{initial segment} of $(Y',\leq ')$ if there exists an $x\in Y'$ such that $Y=\{y\in Y': y<'x\}$ (so in particular $Y\subset Y'$), and for any $y,y'\in Y$, $y\leq y'$ iff $y\leq ' y'$. Define a relation $\preceq$ on $\Omega$ by defining $(Y,\leq)\preceq (Y',\leq ')$ if either $(Y,\leq)=(Y',\leq ')$, or if $(Y,\leq)$ is an initial segment of $(Y',\leq ')$. (a) Show that $\preceq$ is a partial ordering of $\Omega$. (b) There is exactly one minimal element of $\Omega$; what is it? (c) Show that the maximal elements of $\Omega$ are precisely the well-orderings $(X,\leq)$ of $X$. (d) Using Zorn's lemma, conclude the well-ordering principle : every set $X$ has at least one well-ordering. (e) Conversely, use the well-ordering principle to prove the axiom of choice, Axiom 8.1.

Best regards, lorenzo.","Exercise (from T.Tao's Analysis 1 textbook): Let $X$ be a set, and let $\Omega$ be the space of all pairs $(Y,\leq)$, where $Y$ is a subset of $X$ and $\leq$ is a well-ordering of $Y$. If $(Y,\leq)$ and $(Y',\leq ')$ are elements of $\Omega$, we say that $(Y,\leq)$ is an \emph{initial segment} of $(Y',\leq ')$ if there exists an $x\in Y'$ such that $Y=\{y\in Y': y<'x\}$ (so in particular $Y\subset Y'$), and for any $y,y'\in Y$, $y\leq y'$ iff $y\leq ' y'$. Define a relation $\preceq$ on $\Omega$ by defining $(Y,\leq)\preceq (Y',\leq ')$ if either $(Y,\leq)=(Y',\leq ')$, or if $(Y,\leq)$ is an initial segment of $(Y',\leq ')$. (a) Show that $\preceq$ is a partial ordering of $\Omega$. (b) There is exactly one minimal element of $\Omega$; what is it? (c) Show that the maximal elements of $\Omega$ are precisely the well-orderings $(X,\leq)$ of $X$. (d) Using Zorn's lemma, conclude the well-ordering principle : every set $X$ has at least one well-ordering. (e) Conversely, use the well-ordering principle to prove the axiom of choice, Axiom 8.1.      (Hint: place a well-ordering $\leq$ on $\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}X_{\alpha}$, and then consider the minimal elements of each $X_{\alpha}$.) I've managed to do (a), (b), (c), (e) but I'm stuck on (d).

Elements $x$ and $y$ of a Heyting algebra are called complements to each other iff $x \land y = 0$ and $x \lor y =1$ . If it exists, any such $y$ must be unique and in fact equal to $\neg x$ . If $x$ admits a complement then we call it complemented . For any Heyting algebra, the following three conditions are equivalent: $H$ is a Boolean algebra Every element of $H$ is regular. Every element of $H$ is complemented. My question is the following: If we consider this as a set system, then is a Heyting algebra the same as a Boolean algebra except that it does not necessarily need to be closed under set complements? My reasoning is as follows: The terminology complemented , complement , and set complement are quite similar. If we change the lattice notation to the corresponding set notation ( $\neg \iff ^c$ , $\land \iff \cap$ , $\lor \iff \cup$ ), then given a set $A$ , and considering a Heyting algebra $H$ on its lattice of subsets, we have that $X \subset A$ is regular iff $X=Y^c$ for some $Y \in H, Y \subset A$ , $X$ and $Y$ are complements if and only if $X \cap Y=\emptyset$ , $X \cup Y=A \implies X = Y^c$ . The above excerpt implies that if for every $X \in H$ , $X=Y^c$ for some $Y\in H$ (i.e. $H$ is closed under set complements) then it is a Boolean algebra (since it is a lattice and hence closed under finite intersections and unions). The same way that Boolean algebras are the algebraic model for classical logic, Heyting algebras are the algebraic model for intuitionistic logic, which rejects the Law of the Excluded Middle. Not necessarily being closed under set complements seemed to be the set-theoretic analog to the Law of the Excluded Middle not holding (because then $(X^c)^c$ is not necessarily defined, which means that we can not immediately conclude that $X=(X^c)^c$ , the same way in intuitionistic logic we cannot always conclude that $\neg \neg x =x$ ).","According to the corresponding section in Wikipedia : An element of a Heyting algebra is called regular iff for some .

I am confused because I am not sure if I am being asked to strictly construct a bijection or not, although that is probably the case. The thing that confuses me is that I am not sure what ""countable"" means-- even on StackExchange people will say different things. Is countable a bijection from a set to the natural numbers? Is it an injection from the natural numbers to a set? Am I supposed to talk about cardinality? Functions? What about the theorem that subsets of a countable set are countable? Let us assume $A$ is countable and $B$ is a finite subset of $A$. $A$ is countable which means it is either finite, or countably infinite. If $A$ is finite, then $(A-B)$ is clearly finite (and countable) since the difference of two finite sets is finite. If $B = \emptyset$, then $(A-B) = A$, which is countable so $(A-B)$ is countable. Let us consider the case where $A$ is countably infinite. Consider an arbitrary element $x \in (A-B).$ $\implies x \in A \land x \notin B$. So $x\in A$. It follows that $\forall x \in (A-B), x \in A \implies (A-B) \subseteq A$. We can assume $(A-B) \neq A$ because $A$ is countably infinite and $(A-B)$ is finite, so $(A-B) \subset A$.

Bloch introduces equivalent variations of the axiom of choice where the one that will be proven is stated in terms of functions: AC1 Let $I$ be a nonempty set, and let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of nonempty sets indexed by I. Then there is a function $f: I \rightarrow \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ such that $f(i) \in A_i$ for all $i \in I$. As you can read from the text from the above link, the author suggests that AC1 can be deduced from AC2 below AC2 Let $I$ be a nonempty set, and let  $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of nonempty, pairwise disjoint sets indexed by I. Then there is a function $f: I \rightarrow \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ such that $f(i) \in A_i$ for all $i \in I$. Since the second definition implies the first, it is sufficient to prove the second version of AC, which will imply the first version. We will prove that if every surjective function has a right inverse, then AC2 is true, from which it follows that AC1 is true. Here is my attempt of a proof. Suppose that every surjective function has a right inverse, and let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be such a surjective function with a right inverse $g: B \rightarrow A$ where $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets. Since $f$ is surjective and $g$ is a right inverse of $f$ it follows that $g$ is injective (this fact can be proven by contradiction). Since $g$ is a function every $b \in B$ is defined, so that the image $g(\{b\}) \neq \varnothing$. Further, the injectivity of $g$ implies that $g(\{b_1\}) \cap g(\{b_2\}) = \varnothing$ for arbitrary $b_1, b_2 \in B$ such that $b_1 \neq b_2$. Observe also that $g(\{b\})$ contains only one element for each $b$. Finally,  it is clear that $A = \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$ since $g$ is injective,$f$ is defined on $A$, and $g$ is defined on $B$. If we now consider the family $\{g(\{b\})\}_{b \in B}$, it is clear that this collection contains nonempty, pairwise dsjoint sets. Because $A = \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, we have $g:B \rightarrow \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, which is the desired choice function in the second definition above. Therefore, the AC of the first defintiion follows. $\blacksquare$ Any criticisms or advice on the above proof is most welcome. I am unsure about my reason for the set equality $A = \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, but it can be proven formally in the traditional manner in demonstrating that the two sets are subsets of each other, but I wanted to keep my reasons for their equality concise, so I extracted the main arguments from such a proof and put them in this proof for the AC.

If we now consider the family $\{g(\{b\})\}_{b \in B}$, it is clear that this collection contains nonempty, pairwise dsjoint sets. Because $A = \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, we have $g:B \rightarrow \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, which is the desired choice function in the second definition above. Therefore, the AC of the first defintiion follows. $\blacksquare$ Any criticisms or advice on the above proof is most welcome. I am unsure about my reason for the set equality $A = \bigcup_{b \in B} g(\{b\})$, but it can be proven formally in the traditional manner in demonstrating that the two sets are subsets of each other, but I wanted to keep my reasons for their equality concise, so I extracted the main arguments from such a proof and put them in this proof for the AC.

94,Should it be allowed to apply classical logic to set theory?,Should it be allowed to apply classical logic to set theory?,,"It is well known, that the generalized continuum hypothesis isn't provable from the standard axiom system ZFC. GCH (generalized continuum hypothesis). For every infinite set A, there isn't a set M such that |A| < |M| < |P(A)| (where P(A) denotes the power set of A). Using classical logic, one can deduce the following: GCH is either true or false. But for me this statement does not make any sense because GCH is not true nor false, just because the concept of ""set"" is too ambiguous, in other words: the statement does not make any sense because ""GCH is either true or false"" isn't a proposition: it has no truth value.
