The values 0 at 0, 1 at $\pm$1, and $\infty$ at $\pm i$ are specified. To elaborate on the picture: there is a unit disk, with a plus sign on the part of the disk in the first quadrant, a minus sign on the part of the disk in the second quadrant, plus sign for the third quadrant and minus sign on the fourth quadrant. Outside this unit disk, there is a minus sign on the first quadrant, plus sign on the second quadrant, minus sign on third quadrant, and plus sign on the fourth quadrant. Now, back to the question: The signatures +/- indicate that the regions so marked are mapped 1 to 1 onto the upper / lower half-plane. What is f?  Explain why it cannot be otherwise. Edit: I'd like to post an old solution to this problem, as well as ask for help in the intermediate steps that were implicit in the solution itself: One solution offered by a student was this: Using the Reflection Principle, the function f is entirely determined by where it maps a single quarter-circle sector, say, the quarter-circle sector in the first quadrant. Question no. 1 : Why do we use the Reflection Principle?  Is it because, say, the first quarter-circle sector has a + sign, so f maps it to the upper half plane, and the Reflection Principle somehow tells us that f maps the rest of the first quadrant (outside of the quarter-circle sector), which has a minus sign, to the lower half plane?  If this is the case, how do we actually know the conditions are fulfilled to actually apply the Reflection Principle?  Do we think of the boundary of this quarter-circle sector to be the real line, where f takes real values and is continuous on this boundary?  How can we accept that?  Do we make some sort of intermediate transformation so that the image of the boundary is the real line?  (or perhaps just...real-valued, not necessarily the entire real line?) If we consider the mappings g(z)=z^2 and h(w)=−w−1/w, this quarter-circle is mapped to a semicircle and then to the upper half plane, both mappings invertible. Question no. 2 : How do we know to immediately consider these two specific mappings?  Why not consider other mappings of the quarter-circle sector in the first quadrant?  What makes these two choices of mappings so convenient? Thus our mapping must be of the form f(z)=T∘h∘g where T maps from the upper half plane onto the upper half plane. Such a map must be a linear fractional transformation, a consequence of Maximum Modulus Principle / Schwarz' Lemma. Question no. 3 : At which point did we use the Maximum Modulus Principle and Schwarz's Lemma? To determine which T it is, we consider the mappings now. $h(g(0))=\infty$,$h(g(i))=2$,$h(g(1))=−2$, so T must map $\infty$ to 0, 2 to $\infty$, and −2 to 1, so $$T(z)=−4/(z-2)$$ and putting the maps together $$f(z)=4z^2/(1+z^2)^2$$ Question no. 4 : How do we know T will map the upper half plane to the upper half plane?

I can create an open ball with radius $r$ centered at $z$. Then using a limit, I reduce the radius $r$ until it converges on the singular point $z$ and show that this limit (or residue?) is zero. i.e. Show: $$\lim_{r\to 0}\, \left\lvert \int_{C_R} \frac{f(s)}{s-z}\ ds - 2\pi\mathrm{i} f(z) \right\rvert = 0. $$ The problem is that in the above proof I've assumed that $f(s)$ is holomorphic, therefore analytic everywhere therefore continuous everywhere. If I'm only allowed to assume that $f(s)$ is continuous how can I show that $f(s)$ is also analytic? Does this have something to do with existence of a derivative in an open ball around the singularity? How can I make the jump between continuity and analyticity?",,"['complex-analysis', 'proof-writing']"

It is clear that the composite $S\circ f\circ T^{-1}$ satisfies the original form of Schwarz's Lemma, hence we have $|SfT^{-1}(\zeta)|\leq|\zeta|$ or $|Sf(z)|\leq|T(z)|$. "" So far i understood everything.

95,Prove complex polynomial has roots inside unit circle,Prove complex polynomial has roots inside unit circle,,"Given: $p(x)=z^{2012}-z^{1010}+2z^{1006}+20243z^8-2z^4+1$ I need to prove the polynomial has a root $|z_0|<1$. What I have so far: Plugging $p(0)=1$ we get (from the fundamental theorem of algebra) that $|z_0|...|z_n|=1$, were $z_0,...,z_n$ are the roots of the polynomial. So this means the polynomial's roots are either all on the unit circle, or at least one of them is inside of it. (Maybe an 'assume for the sake of contradiction' is good here?) Also, because $p(-1), p(1)$ aren't roots we know all the roots are complex. I was thinking of using the intermediate value theorem somehow here, but it doesn't seem applicable (for one, I'd need to prove $p(A)$ is open for some choice of $A$, but we haven't learned any theorem that would make this very obvious). Also, this polynomial's exponent coefficients are all even, which kind of feels like it should mean something, but I don't know. This being homework, I'd appreciate hints moreso than answers, but I'll accept either.

Then the function  $$f(z)=\int_\mathbf{T} \mathrm{Im}\left(\frac{\zeta+z}{\zeta-z}\right) d\mu(\zeta)$$ is harmonic on the unit disc and its radial limits exist almost everywhere. Does the Hilbert transform of $\mu$ equal the radial limit function of $f$ on $\mathbf{T}$ almost everywhere and why? The Hilbert transform of $\mu$ is  $$(H\mu)(z)=p.v.\frac{1}{\pi}\int_\mathbf{T}\frac{d\mu(\zeta)}{z-\zeta}$$ for $z\in\mathbf{T}$. (Please check, I'm not sure) I have come so far to see, that the Hilbert transform and the radial limits of $f$ behave somewhat similarly as can be seen from noting that $$\mathrm{Im}\left(\frac{e^{it}+re^{is}}{e^{it}-re^{is}}\right)\rightarrow \cot(s/2)$$ as $r\rightarrow 1$ and $\cot(s/2)$ behaves similarly as $2/s$ when $|s|$ is small.
