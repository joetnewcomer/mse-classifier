44,Doubt in understanding Space $\mathscr D(\Omega)$,Doubt in understanding Space,\mathscr D(\Omega),"I was reading about distributions from Rudin. I had 2 doubts in understanding space $\mathscr D(\Omega)$ . Here is the relevant section: 6.2 The space $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ Consider a nonempty open set $\Omega \subset R^{n}$ . For each compact $K \subset \Omega$ , the Fréchet space $\mathscr{D}_{K}$ was described in Section 1.46. The union of the spaces $\mathscr{D}_{K}$ , as $K$ ranges over all compact subsets of $\Omega$ , is the test function space $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ . It is clear that $\mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ is a vector space, with respect to the usual definitions of addition and scalar multiplication of complex functions. Explicitly, $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ if and only if $\phi \in C^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and the support of $\phi$ is a compact subset of $\Omega$ . Let us introduce the norms $$ \|\phi\|_{N}=\max \left\{\left|D^{\alpha} \phi(x)\right|: x \in \Omega,|\alpha| \leq N\right\}\tag1 $$ for $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ and $N=0,1,2, \ldots$ ; see Section $1.46$ for the notations $D^{\alpha}$ and $|\alpha|$ . The restrictions of these norms to any fixed $\mathscr{D}_{K} \subset \mathscr{D}(\Omega)$ induce the same topology on $\mathscr{D}_{K}$ as do the seminorms $p_{N}$ of Section $1.46$ . To see this, note that to each $K$ corresponds an integer $N_{0}$ such that $K \subset K_{N}$ for all $N \geq N_{0}$ .

However, this topology has the disadvantage of not being complete. For example, take $n=1, \Omega=R$ , pick $\phi \in \mathscr{D}(R)$ with support in $[0,1], \phi>0$ in $(0,1)$ , and define $$ \psi_{m}(x)=\phi(x-1)+\frac{1}{2} \phi(x-2)+\cdots+\frac{1}{m} \phi(x-m) $$ Then $\left\{\psi_{m}\right\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the suggested topology of $\mathscr{D}(R)$ , but $\lim \psi_{m}$ does not have compact support, hence is not in $\mathscr{D}(R)$ .
