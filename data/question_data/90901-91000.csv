If $G$ is a locally compact topological group and $\pi:G\rightarrow U(H)$ is a unitary representation of $G$ on a Hilbert space $H$ , we can talk about an action, $\pi'$ , of $L^1(G, \mathbb{C})$ on $H$ . Namely for $f\in L^1(G, \mathbb{C})$ , and $v\in H$ , define $$\pi'(f)v := \int_G f(y)\cdot(\pi(y)(v))dy$$ where $dy$ is Haar measure and the integral requires the theory of integration of Banach space valued functions.  That is, we define the integral as a limit of integrals of step functions which form a Cauchy sequence in $L^1(G,H)$ and which converge pointwise almost everywhere to $y \mapsto f(y)\cdot(\pi(y)(v))$ .

79,Integrating the Derivative of the sgn Function,Integrating the Derivative of the sgn Function,,"I would like to prove the following equality $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \partial_t |u(t,x)| \text{d}x = \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \text{sgn}(u(t,x))\partial_t u(t,x)  \ \text{d}x $ . Where $u: (0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , is a function in $C([0,\infty); L^1(\mathbb{R}^N) \cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^N) ) \cap C([0,\infty); W^{2,p} (\mathbb{R}^N) ) \cap C^1((0,\infty); L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)) $ , for all $p \in [1,\infty]$ . And sgn is the sign function: $\text{sgn}(x) = \begin{cases} 1, \ x>0 \\ 0, \ x = 0 \\ -1, \ x < 0   \end{cases}$ We know that $ \partial_t |u(t,x)| = \partial_t [u(t,x)\text{sgn}(u(t,x)] = \text{sgn}(u(t,x))\partial_t u(t,x) + u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x))$ , by the product rule. (We take derivatives here in the distribution sense.) The goal, then is to prove that $ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) \text{d}x = 0$ . My question is how we can show explicitly that the above integral is $0$ . My intuition is the following: $\partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) = \partial_u \text{sgn}(u) \partial_t u $ , and we should have $\partial_u \text{sgn}(u) = 0$ almost everywhere. We only have 'jumps' for $ \text{sgn}(u) $ at $u=0$ , but since we are considering the integral of $ u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) $ the extra factor of $u$ should ensure we have $ u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) = 0$ , for all $t$ , and thus $ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) \text{d}x = 0$ . This intuition of course isn't a formal proof. In particular, I have been told to consider the following: We know that: $\int_{\mathbb{R}} \phi(x)\partial_x \text{sgn}(x) \text{d}x = - \int_{\mathbb{R}} (\partial_x\phi(x)) \text{sgn}(x) \text{d}x$ $ = -\int_{0}^{\infty} (\partial_x\phi(x)) \text{sgn}(x) \text{d}x - \int^{0}_{-\infty} (\partial_x\phi(x)) \text{sgn}(x) \text{d}x = \phi(0) - (-\phi(0)) = 2\phi(0),$ for any differentiable function $\phi \in C(\mathbb{R}^N).$ I have been asked to show why something similar does not happen in my integral. Right away, we can see that the derivative and the integral are over different variables in my integral, but I will need a more precise answer than that... EDIT 1 It can be shown explicitly that $ \partial_t |u(t,x)| = \text{sgn}(u(t,x))\partial_t u(t,x)$ whenever $u \neq 0$ . Thus we need only show that $ \int_{A_t} u(t,x) \partial_t \text{sgn}(u(t,x)) \text{d}x = 0$ , where $A_t := \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^N \ | \ u(t,x) = 0 \} $ . EDIT 2 I have been told to consider approximating sgn with smooth functions. Let us consider a set of smooth functions $ \Psi_{\epsilon}(x) =  \displaystyle \frac{\epsilon^{-1}x}{(1+\epsilon^{-2}x^2)}  $ . Then, letting $\epsilon \in (0,1]$ , we have $ \Psi_{\epsilon}(x) \in [0,1] $ , for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ , and we have $\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \Psi_{\epsilon}(x) = \text{sgn}(x) $ , for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . It is also easy to show that $\partial_x \Psi_{\epsilon}(x) \rightarrow \partial_x \text{sgn}(x)$ , as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ , for all $x \neq 0$ . (i.e. almost everywhere). It seems that integrating with the derivative of $\Psi$ runs into the exact same problems as before? Does anyone know why this is helpful? EDIT 3 It can be shown, via the monotone convergence theorem, that $\int_{\mathbb{R}} \partial_x \text{sgn}(x) \text{d}x = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \partial_x \Psi_{\epsilon}(x) \text{d}x = 2.$ The question then is whether we can extend this result in a useful way, perhaps $\int_{\mathbb{R}} u \partial_t u \partial_u \text{sgn}(u) \text{d}x = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \int_{\mathbb{R}} u \partial_t u \partial_u \Psi_{\epsilon}(u) \text{d}x$ .

In particular, why is it sufficient for an operator to be considered well-defined, when we can show that for any $f \in L^{p}$ that $\|\ell_{f}\|_{*}<\infty$ . In my previous, elementary versions of well-definedness, we defined it as for any $f \in L^{q}$ there exists exactly one $\ell\in (L^{p})^{*}$ so that $Jf=\ell$ . Now showing that $\| Jf\|_{*}<\infty$ definitely shows that $Jf \in (L^{p})^{*}$ but it does not show that there is a unique $\ell \in (L^{p})^{*}$ so that $Jf=\ell$ . In other words, there may exist another $m \in (L^{p})^{*}$ where $m\neq \ell$ so that $m = Jf$ and $\ell = Jf$ . I thought that this was the point of proving well-definition. Why is it always reduced to the idea that well-definition depends only on whether $\|\ell_{f}\|_{*}<\infty$ ? Any clarity on this topic will help me greatly.","Let where and define My question is related in general to the notion of well definedness for operators. In particular, why is it sufficient for an operator to be considered well-defined, when we can show that for any that . In my previous, elementary versions of well-definedness, we defined it as for any there exists exactly one so that . Now showing that definitely shows that but it does not show that there is a unique so that . In other words, there may exist another where so that and . I thought that this was the point of proving well-definition. Why is it always reduced to the idea that well-definition depends only on whether ?
