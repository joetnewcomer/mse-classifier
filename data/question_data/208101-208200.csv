Proof: Suppose that $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $p>5$ and $p$ is prime and $2p+1$ is prime. By the quotient-remainder theorem, $p$ can be written in one of the forms $3q$ or $3q+1$ or $3q+2$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$ .

Question: Why is it okay to write...""for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,n\ge 3.5$""?","So I've been playing around with some mathematical induction proofs and I usually open with a statement similar to: (example below) Denote the statement involving $n$ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,n\ge 4$   $$S(n): 2^n<n!$$ Notice you could also write $n\ge 4$ as $n>3$ because we're playing in the positive integers. Though they have a no real difference between the two, they appear differently. Now, why is it okay to write... for $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+,n\ge 3.5$ when 3.5 does NOT exist in the universe in which $n$ is in? It seems like 3.5 is sort of undefined.

72,Strong Induction: Prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational,Strong Induction: Prove that  is irrational,\sqrt{2},"This question comes directly out of Rosen's Discrete Mathematics and It's Applications pertaining to Strong Induction. Use strong induction to prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. [Hint: Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $\sqrt{2}\neq n/b$ for any positive integer $b$.] Solution : Let $P(n)$ be the statement that there is no positive integer b such that $\sqrt{2}= n/b$. Basis step: $P(1)$ is true because $\sqrt{2} > 1 \geq 1/b$ for all positive integers b. Inductive step: Assume that $P(j)$ is true for all $j\leq k$, where $k$ is an arbitrary positive integer; we prove that $P(k+1)$ is true by contradiction. Assume that $\sqrt{2} = (k+1)/b$ for some positive integer b. Then $2b^2 = (k+1)^2$, so $(k + 1)^2$ is even, and hence, $k+1$ is even. So write $k+1 = 2t$ for some positive integer $t$, whence $2b^2 = 4t^2$ and $b^2 = 2t^2$. By the same reasoning as before, b is even, so $b = 2s$ for some positive integer $s$. Then $\sqrt{2} = (k + 1)/b = (2t)/(2s) = t/s$. But $t \leq k$, so this contradicts the inductive hypothesis, and our proof of the inductive step is complete. My confusion comes from how we've proven our inductive step by contradiction. Using our hint, we assume $P(n)$ is $\sqrt{2} \neq n/b$. When we start our proof by contradiction component, we assume $P(n)$ is $\sqrt{2} = n/b$ for some $b$ in terms of some arbitrary positive integer $k$: $\sqrt{2} = k/b$. How does showing that $t \leq k$ contradict our inductive hypothesis? Is it because we assume $k/b$ is in reduced terms, where $k$ can not be any smaller and the fact that $t \leq k$ contradicts this? What am I lacking in my understanding of the proof by contradiction? Any help would be much appreciated. Please let me know if you would like any clarification or further explanation of my understanding.

Let this graph be G. Find an explicit formula for $χ(G;t)$. My answer: $χ(G;k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)^2$ Is this correct? Or is this not an 'explicit' formula?","1) How do you prove the Chromatic recurrence theorem: $$χ(G;k)=χ(G−e;k)−χ(G·e;k)$$ I'm thinking by induction, but then you would have to assume something about the type of graph G...surely it can't be done any other way? 2) (See below - please ignore my numbering)!

96,The difference of two consecutive perfect squares is always odd,The difference of two consecutive perfect squares is always odd,,I am working on another homework assignment about proofs. The question is: Prove or find counterexample: the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is odd? There is no counterexample correct? I am thinking this is always true. If I were to do 7^2-6^2 the answer is odd. I am unsure of how to start the proof though. I am new to proofs and not sure what to really do,I am working on another homework assignment about proofs.

Find the explicit formula for $f_n=af_{n-1}+b$ for $n \ge 1$ and $f_0 = c$ So I rewrote it as $f_n-af_{n-1}-b=0$ which gives the characteristic equation as $x^2-ax-b=0$. The quadratic formula gives roots $x= \frac{a+\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2}, \frac{a-\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2}$ Then $f_n=P_1(\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2})^n+P_2(\frac{a-\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2})^n$ and using the initial condition $t_0=c$ gives $C=P_1+P_2 \Rightarrow P_1=C-P_2$ So $(C-P_2)(\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2})^n+P_2(\frac{a-\sqrt{a^2+4b}}{-2})^n$ what next?
