(I will italicize physics terminology that we will translate). The above theory is a $U(1)$ - gauge theory , i.e. a geometrical physical theory formulated using a principal bundle - thus one which must ""respect"" the mathematical redundancy of describing a principal bundle (its isomorphism class). This is analogous to the fact that isometric Lorentzian manifolds (if there are fields, we pull these back naturally too) describe the same spacetime (and fields). Namely that $$S_{EH}[(M,g)] = S_{EH}[(N,h)]$$ when $(M,g)$ is isometric to $(N,h)$ .

Now  a trivialization of this bundle $(E,\pi,M)$ over a neighboorhood $\mathcal{U} \subset M$ is called a local gauge . A local gauge transformation is a change in this trivialization and hence equivalently the related section (the local smooth section equivalent to the trivialization, which can also be called a local gauge or mathematically, a trivializing section). Anyway, it is a standard fact that such local gauge transformations are in one to one correspondence with bundle automorphisms of $\pi^{-1}(\mathcal{U})$ . The $A_\mu$ above is the pullback of the principal $U(1)$ connection to the trivializing neighborhood by some trivializing section, so $s^{*}\omega$ .

That is, for each $A \in SO(n)$ , the map $\varphi_A:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ given by $x \mapsto Ax$ is a Riemannian isometry of $(\mathbb R^n,g)$ . Let $\exp_0:T_0\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ denote the Riemannian exponential map at zero. Recall that $\exp_0(v) := \gamma_v(1)$ , where $\gamma_v:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ is the unique maximal geodesic starting at zero with initial velocity $v$ . Since $g$ is complete, $\exp_0$ is surjective (there exists a geodesic connecting any point in $\mathbb R^n$ to zero). It is well-known that $\exp_0$ is a diffeomorphism if restricted to a sufficiently small neighbourhood around zero. Question: Is $\exp_0$ a diffeomorphism? (I know that it remains to show $\exp_0$ is injective and a local diffeomorphism, but I'm not sure how to show these.) EDIT: I believe the answer is yes and I have come up with a solution. Please let me know if I have made a mistake somewhere. Consider the inner product space $(T_0 \mathbb R^n,g_0)$ . Observe that the isotropy subgroup of $0 \in \mathbb R^n$ is the entire group $SO(n)$ . Thus, $SO(n)$ acts by linear isometries on $(T_0 \mathbb R^n,g_0)$ via $A \cdot v := d \varphi_A(v)$ . For each $r > 0$ , let us define $$S_r(0) := \left\{v \in T_0 \mathbb R^n \mid g_0(v,v) = r^2\right\}.$$ Lemma 1. For any $r > 0$ , $SO(n)$ acts transitively on $S_r(0)$ . Proof. First, let us identify $T_0 \mathbb R^n$ with $\mathbb R^n$ via the linear isomorphism $\partial_i|_0 \mapsto e_i$ . Here, $\partial_i|_0$ are the coordinate vectors induced by the identity chart, and $e_i$ denote the standard basis for $\mathbb R^n$ . Recall that under this identification, for each $A \in SO(n)$ , the differential $d\varphi_A|_0:T_0 \mathbb R^n \rightarrow T_0\mathbb R^n$ is just $\varphi_A:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ , because $\varphi_A$ is linear. Thus, under this identification, the action of $SO(n)$ on $T_0 \mathbb R^n \cong \mathbb R^n$ is exactly the same as the original action. We know that $SO(n)$ acts transitively on the Euclidean spheres $\mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Thus, we are done if we show that $g_0$ is a multiple of the standard dot product $\bullet$ on $\mathbb R^n$ . Set $c := g_0(e_1,e_1)$ . Fix an arbitrary element in $\mathbb R^n$ , which can be written as $tv$ , with $t \geq  0$ and $v\bullet v = 1$ . Since $SO(n)$ acts transitively on $\mathbb S^{n-1}(1)$ , there exists $A \in SO(n)$ such that $Av = e_1$ . Therefore, since each $d\varphi_A|_0=\varphi_A$ is a linear isometry of $(T_0 \mathbb R^n\cong \mathbb R^n,g_0)$ , we find $$g_0(tv,tv) = g_0(Atv, Atv) = t^2 g_0(Av,Av) = t^2 g_0(e_1,e_1) =  t^2 c = c (tv \bullet tv),$$ as desired. $\square$ Lemma 2. Fix $R > 0$ . Then there exists some $r > 0$ such that the restriction $\exp_0|_{S_r(0)}:S_r(0)  \rightarrow  \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ is a surjective smooth submersion. Proof. Since $\exp_0$ is surjective, there exists a unit speed geodesic $\gamma:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ such that $\gamma(0) = 0$ and $\gamma(r) \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ for some $r > 0$ . Let $v := \gamma'(0)$ . First, let us show that the image of $S_r(0)$ is contained in $S^{n-1}(R)$ . To this end,fix an arbitrary element of $S_r(0)$ , which can be written as $rw$ , where $r > 0$ and $w \in S_1(0)$ . We wish to show that $\exp_0(rw) \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . By the previous lemma, we know that $SO(n)$ acts transitively on $S_1(0)$ , so there exists some $A \in SO(n)$ such that $w = d \varphi_A(v) = (\varphi_A \circ \gamma)'(0).$ Uniqueness of geodesics implies that the geodesic $\varphi_A \circ \gamma$ is given by $t \mapsto \exp_0(tw)$ . In particular, $A \gamma(r) = (\varphi_A \circ \gamma)(r) = \exp_0(rw)$ . Thus, $\exp_0(rw)$ belongs to $\mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Next, let us show surjectivity. Suppose $p \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Then there exists $A \in SO(n)$ such that $p = A\gamma(r) = (\varphi_A \circ \gamma)(r)$ . We know that $\varphi_A \circ \gamma$ is a unit speed geodesic starting at zero. Set $w := (\varphi_A \circ \gamma)'(0)$ . By uniqueness of geodesics, we know that $\varphi_A \circ \gamma$ is given by $t \mapsto \exp_0(tw)$ . In particular, $\exp_0(rw) = (\varphi_A \circ \gamma)(r) = p$ . Now, let us show that $\exp_0|_{S_r(0)}:S_r(0)  \rightarrow  \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ is a smooth submersion. Since we have shown surjectivity, the Global Rank Theorem tells us that it suffices to show that $\exp_0|_{S_r(0)}$ has constant rank. By Lemma 1, we know that $SO(n)$ acts transitively on the domain $S_r(0)$ . Thus, by the Equivariant Rank Theorem, it suffices to show that $\exp_0|_{S_r(0)}:S_r(0)  \rightarrow  \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ is $SO(n)$ -equivariant. Fix $rv \in S_r(0)$ , where $r > 0$ and $v \in S_1(0)$ . Then $$A\cdot \exp_0(rv) = (\varphi_A \circ \exp_0)(rv) = (\exp_0 \circ d \varphi_A |_0)(rv) = \exp_0(A \cdot rv),$$ where we have used the naturality of the exponential map in the second equality. $\square$ Lemma 3. Fix $R > 0$ . Let $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ be a unit speed geodesic such that $\gamma(0) = 0$ and $\gamma(r) \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Then $\gamma'(r)$ is orthogonal to $T_{\gamma(r)}S^{n-1}(R)$ . Proof. Let $v := \gamma'(0)$ . By Lemma 2, we know that $$d (\exp_0|_{S_r(0)})|_{rv}: T_{rv} S_r(0) \rightarrow T_{\gamma(r)} \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$$ is a linear isomorphism. Let $w \in T_{\gamma(r)} \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Then there exists $u \in T_{rv} S_r(0)$ such that $dexp_0|_{rv}(u) = w$ . The Gauss Lemma tells us that $$g_{\gamma(r)}(w, \gamma'(r)) = g_{\gamma(r)}(d\exp_0|_{rv}(u),d\exp_0|_{rv}(v) ) = g_0(u,v) = 0.$$ This completes the proof. $\square$ Lemma 4. Let $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ be a geodesic such that $\gamma(0) = 0$ . Then $\gamma(r) \neq 0$ for all $r > 0$ . Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $\gamma(r) = 0$ for some $r > 0$ . Since $[0,r]$ is compact and $\gamma$ is continuous, we know that the image $\gamma([0,r])$ is bounded in the Euclidean norm $\| \cdot \|$ . Thus, there exists $R > 0$ such that $\|\gamma(t) \| < R$ for all $t \in [0,r]$ . Now, fix $p \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Since $(\mathbb R^n,g)$ is complete, there exists a unit speed geodesic $\alpha: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ such that $\alpha(0) = 0$ , $\alpha(s) = p$ for some $s > 0$ , and $\alpha|_{[0,s]}$ is distance minimising with respect to $g$ . Choose $A \in SO(n)$ so that $\gamma'(0) = d\varphi_A(\alpha'(0)) = (\varphi_A \circ \alpha)'(0)$ . By uniqueness of geodesics, we know that $\gamma = \varphi_A \circ \alpha$ . Therefore, $\gamma|_{[0,s]}$ minimises the distance (with respect to the metric $g$ ) between $0$ and $\gamma(s) \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . It follows that $r < s$ . Consider the reparameterisation $\beta: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ given by $\beta(t) := \gamma(t + r)$ . Then $\beta$ is a unit speed geodesic such that $\beta(0) = 0$ and $\beta(s-r) = \gamma(s-r + r) = \gamma(s)$ . However, observe that $$L_g(\beta|_{[0,s-r]}) = s-r < s = L_g(\gamma|_{[0,s]}),$$ so this contradicts the fact that $\gamma$ is distance minimising. $\square$ Proposition. The exponential map $\exp_0:T_0 \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ is injective. Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $\exp_0(rv) = \exp_0(sw)$ for some $r,s \geq 0$ and $v,w \in S_1(0)$ . Let $\alpha,\beta:\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ denote the unit speed geodesics given by $\alpha:t \mapsto \exp_0(tv)$ and $\beta:t \mapsto \exp_0(tw)$ . Then $\alpha(r) = \beta(s)$ . If $\alpha(r) = \beta(s) = 0$ , then Lemma 4 implies that $r = s$ , so $rv = sw$ . Thus, let us suppose $\alpha(r) =\beta(s)$ is non-zero. Then $r,s > 0$ . Fix $R>0$ such that $\alpha(r) = \beta(s)$ belongs to $\mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ .  By Lemma 3, we know that $\alpha'(r)$ and $\beta'(s)$ are both orthogonal to $T_{\alpha(r)}\mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Since $\mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ is a codimension one embedded submanifold, we conclude that either $\alpha'(r) = \beta'(s)$ or $\alpha'(r) = - \beta'(s)$ . Let us show that in $rv = sw$ in the first case, and the second case leads to contradiction. Now, suppose $\alpha'(r) = \beta'(s)$ . Without loss of generality, suppose $r \leq  s$ . Define $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ to be the unit speed geodesic given by $\gamma(t) := \beta(t + s - r)$ . Now, observe that $\gamma(r) = \beta(s) = \alpha(r)$ and $\gamma'(r) = \beta'(s) = \alpha'(r)$ . Uniqueness of geodesics implies that $\gamma = \alpha$ . In particular, $0 = \beta(0) = \gamma(s-r) = \alpha(s-r)$ . Thus, by Lemma 4, we must have $s = r$ . Therefore, $\alpha = \gamma = \beta$ . In particular, $v = \alpha'(0) = \beta'(0) = w$ , so $sv = rw$ , as desired. Finally, suppose that $\alpha'(r) = -\beta'(s)$ . Let $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ be the unit speed geodesic given by $\gamma(t) := \beta(-t + s + r)$ . Then observe that $\gamma(r) = \beta(-r + s + r) = \beta(s) = \alpha(r)$ and $\gamma'(r) = - \beta'(-r + s + r) = -\beta'(s) = \alpha'(r)$ , so uniqueness of geodesics implies that $\gamma = \alpha$ . In particular, $\alpha(s + r) = 0$ . However, Lemma 4 implies that this is a contradiction, since $s + r > 0$ . $\square$ Proposition. The exponential map $\exp_0:T_0 \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ is a diffeomorphism. Proof. We have shown that $\exp_0:T_0 \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ is bijective. By the Global Rank Theorem, it suffices to show that $\exp_0$ has constant rank. Thus, fix $r > 0$ and $v \in S_1(0)$ , and let $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$ denote the unit speed geodesic given by $\gamma(t) := \exp_0(tv)$ . Let $R > 0$ be such that $\gamma(r) \in \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Consider the differential $d\exp_0|_{rv}:T_0 \mathbb R^n \rightarrow T_{\gamma(r)} \mathbb R^n$ . Let $e_2,\ldots,e_n$ denote unit vectors in $T_0 \mathbb R^n$ such that $\gamma'(0),e_2,\ldots,e_n$ forms an orthonormal basis for $T_0 \mathbb R^n$ . Then we know that $e_2,\ldots,e_n$ must belong to $T_{rv} S_r(0)$ . By Lemma 2, we know that $\exp_0|_{S_r(0)}:S_r(0)  \rightarrow  \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ is a submersion, so in particular, $d \exp_0|_{rv}(e_2),\ldots,d \exp_0|_{rv}(e_n)$ forms a basis of $T_{\gamma(r)} \mathbb S^{n-1}(R)$ . Since $\gamma'(r) = d \exp_0|_{v}$ is orthogonal to these vectors, it follows that $d\exp_0|_{rv}$ is a linear isomorphism. This completes the proof. $\square$","Let be a complete -invariant metric on . That is, for each , the map given by is a Riemannian isometry of . Let denote the Riemannian exponential map at zero.

There are other, equivalent ways to think about what type of mathematical object the Riemann curvature tensor is. E.g. one way to think of it as a self-adjoint operator on the real inner product space of two-forms. (This interpretation is arguably more natural for the ""all-lowered"" version $R_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma}$ .) Is it also possible to think of the Riemann tensor as a linear-operator-valued two-form in its last two indices $\rho$ and $\sigma$ , and therefore integrate it over a 2D surface in the manifold? I've only ever seen the Riemann tensor described in terms of infinitesimal loops in the manifold. But is it legitimate to think of it as a two-form and integrate it (over $\rho$ and $\sigma$ ) over a finite surface $S$ , and get the holonomy of the oriented boundary loop $\partial S$ ? On the one hand, this seems plausible by the general heuristic picture for Green's theorem: On the other hand, I doubt that it's correct, because (a) I can't find any sources saying that it is, and (b) more concretely, it seems to me that the holonomy of an oriented loop $\partial S$ should depend on the base point (although I'm not sure about that). But the formal integral $$ \iint_S R^\mu_{\ \ \nu \rho \sigma} dx^\rho \wedge dx^\sigma $$ does not pick out any distinguished point on $\partial S$ . Is there any sense in which this is a legitimate operation? If not, is there any other way to construct the (pseudo-)Riemannian holonomy of arbitrary oriented loops (with base point) in $M$ from the Riemann tensor?

Does $[V=d/d\mu, W=d/d\lambda]$ point from $A$ to $B$ or from $B$ to $A$ ? Adapted from Schutz's ""Geometrical methods in mathematical physics"": But in other sources the sign differs, e.g. Hehl 2007 : Who is right? The long of it: I'm reading Bernard Schutz's ""Geometrical methods in mathematical physics"", which -- being a physicist myself -- strikes a great balance for me between explanatory detail and rigor. I'd like to prefix my question with some things that I think I understand, so that it's easier for others to point to where I might have erred. I added two figures to illustrate what I'm trying to get to. I cannot find an answer to my specific question, though I have seen similar arguments as the following posted. I can understand how vector fields can be seen as operators acting on functions. The coordinate representation of the Lie bracket $[V, W] = \left(V^j \frac{W^i}{\partial x_j} - W^j \frac{V^i}{\partial x_j} \right)\partial_i$ is clear to me and using the product rule, I can derive the ""product rule"" $[fX, gY] = fg[X, Y] + fX(Y) - gY(f)X$ . Schutz describes the geometric interpretation of the Lie bracket by using the exponentiation of vector fields that describe finite motions along integral curves: Let $V = d / d\lambda$ and $W = d / d \mu$ be vector fields. Starting at a point $P$ , moving $\Delta \lambda = \epsilon$ along the V curve through $P$ to a point $R$ , and then moving $\Delta \mu = \epsilon$ along a W curve, ending at a point $A$ . Then start again at $P$ , go first $\Delta \mu$ along $W$ and then $\Delta \lambda$ along $V$ ending at a point $B \neq A$ . The vector from $A$ to be $B$ is $\epsilon^2[V, W]$ , to lowest order in $\varepsilon$ , since $x^i(R) = \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\lambda}\right)x^i|_P \\ x^i(A) = \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\mu}\right) \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\lambda}\right)x^i|_P$ and analogously $x^i(B) = \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\lambda}\right) \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\mu}\right)x^i|_P$ . Using the Taylor series of the exponentials yields $x^i(B) - x^i(A) = \left[\exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\lambda}\right) \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\mu}\right), \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\mu}\right) \exp\left(\epsilon \frac{d}{d\lambda}\right)\right]x^i|_P \\  = \epsilon^2\left[V, W\right]|_P$ . This makes sense to me, the exponentials act from the left on $x^i$ so the rightmost exponential acts first.  You from $P$ to $A$ via $WV$ and you get from $P$ to $B$ via $VW$ . So all of this should be easy to verify with an example, right? Lets take polar coordinates $(r, \phi)$ in 2d and three vector fields: $V := \cos(\phi) \partial_x + \sin(\phi) \partial_y = \frac{x}{r} \partial_x + \frac{y}{r} = \partial_r\\ W := -r\sin(\phi) \partial_x + r \cos(\phi) \partial_y = -y \partial_x + x \partial_y = \partial_{\phi}\\ Z := -\sin(\phi) \partial_x +  \cos(\phi) \partial_y = \frac{1}{r} \partial_{\phi}$ The vector fields $V$ and $W$ are the usual ones for polar coordinates and form a coordinate basis, since they commute with each other: $[V, W] = 0$ (just plug in the definition of the Lie bracket and use the product rule for the Lie bracket together with commuting partial derivatives $[\partial_x, \partial_y] = 0$ . Ok. Using the product rule for Lie brackets yet again yields straightforwardly: $[V, Z] = [V, \frac{1}{r} W] = \frac{1}{r} [V, W] + \frac{\partial r^{-1}}{\partial_r} \partial_\phi = -\frac{1}{r^2} \partial_\phi= -\frac{1}{r} Z \neq 0$ I get the same result by separately computing $V(Z) = ... = 0$ and $Z(V) = \frac{1}{r^2}\partial_\phi$ and again $[V, Z] = -\frac{1}{r^2} \partial_\phi$ . So the vector field $[V, Z]$ points opposite to $\partial_\phi$ . Finally my question: How does this connect to $[V, Z]$ pointing from $A$ to $B$ ? Following the above reasoning of following the flows, I get to $A$ by following first $V$ and then $Z$ , so as an operator it's $ZV$ ; and I get to $B$ by following first $Z$ and then $V$ , so as an operator it's $VZ$ . Sketching this for small $\epsilon$ (or large radii so that the circle segments look almost like straight lines), starting at $P = (x=1, y=0)$ results in $B$ being almost directly above $A$ , so $\vec B - \vec A = \epsilon^2 [V, Z] + O(\epsilon^4)$ points almost completely in positive $y$ direction. But from my calculations I see that $[V, Z] = - \frac{1}{r^2}\partial_\phi$ so evaluated at $P = (1, 0)$ this yields $-\partial_y$ . Exactly opposite of what I expected! I can follow the derivation of why the Lie bracket points from $A$ to $B$ , but the example yields the opposite! Where am I going wrong?

85,Divergence of tensor fields,Divergence of tensor fields,,"I have found numerous definitions for the divergence of a tensor which makes me confused as to trust which one to use. In Itskov's Tensor Algebra and Tensor Analysis for Engineers , he begins with Gauss's theorem to define \begin{equation} \text{div} ~\boldsymbol{S} = \lim_{V \to 0} \frac{1}{V} \int_{\partial V} \boldsymbol{S} ~\boldsymbol{n} ~da \end{equation} which, resorting to some coordinates system, gives \begin{equation} \text{div} ~\boldsymbol{S} = \boldsymbol{S}_{,i} ~\boldsymbol{g}^i = S_{j}^{~~i} |_i ~\boldsymbol{g}^j \end{equation} I actually like this definition because of its naturalness from beginning with Gauss's theorem. However, it requires choosing a basis. To define a coordinate-free divergence, I have come across multiple definitions: One from this wiki article defines the divergence as \begin{equation} (\boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot S}) \boldsymbol{\cdot a}  =   \boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot} ~(\boldsymbol{S ~a}) \end{equation} where $\boldsymbol{a}$ is an arbitrary constant vector. This gives \begin{equation} \boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot S}  =  S^{i}_{~~j} |_i ~\boldsymbol{g}^j \end{equation} where the first index is contracted. Yet, another wiki article defines \begin{equation}   (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{T})\cdot\mathbf{c} =     \boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\left(\mathbf{c}\cdot\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}\right) \end{equation} to give the exact same result as the other wiki article. (Here I presume that Reddy's notation were used, where he uses dot product for denoting any product he can find! One problem with Reddy's notation is that I cannot figure out how he dot products a vector into a dyad, as in $\boldsymbol{e}_k \cdot \boldsymbol{e}_i\otimes\boldsymbol{e}_j$ , so please do not advise me using his notation. This being said, I don't know what $\mathbf{c}\cdot\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}$ means; is it $\mathbf{c}~\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}$ where $\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}$ is acting from the left on the vector $\mathbf{c}$ ? If so, I don't think this holds for a general curvilinear basis. I guess $\mathbf{c}~\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T} = \boldsymbol{c}^\textsf{T}\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}$ is more appropreate, but I don't reckon Reddy means this way.) This article also says that Itskov's result (contracting the second index) is actually true only for symmetric tensors, which Itskov never assumes. Abeyratne's lecture notes (p. 64) uses this definition \begin{equation} (\text{div} ~\boldsymbol{T})\cdot\mathbf{c} =     \text{div} \left(\boldsymbol{T}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{c}\right) \end{equation} where he claims that the second index gets contracted. I don't know whether $\text{div}$ and $\boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot}$ are different or the same. Ogden's ""Nonlinear Elastic deformations"" puts it in a very nice way: that there are three possible contractions for the gradient of a 2nd rank tensor $\boldsymbol{\nabla}\otimes \boldsymbol{T}$ , so defining the divergence is a matter of convention. He contracts the first index. But still, which one should one choose for a throughout consistency in his calculations. What is the definition of divergence? Kelly's lecture notes were a little helpful, yet because of its different notations from other, I always get caught wondering if I am doing the right way. For example, he finds for the gradient of a tensor field that $\text{grad}~\boldsymbol{v} = (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\otimes\boldsymbol{v})^\textsf{T}$ , but Ogden finds it with the transpose, and I believe they have used the same definitions to start with, namely the directional derivative. This will make much mess for me, as to define the divergence of the vector field whether as $\boldsymbol{\nabla\cdot v} = \text{tr} (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\otimes\boldsymbol{v})^\textsf{T}$ or as $\boldsymbol{\nabla\cdot v} = \text{tr} (\boldsymbol{\nabla}\otimes\boldsymbol{v})$ .

First let me introduce some notations and context: They consider a vector subbundle of $T(M \times I)$ , where $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is a time interval, consisting of vector tangents to the first factor $M$ in the sense that $(\pi_2)_* = 0$ . On that bundle, a connection $\nabla$ is defined via the one on $M$ denoted by $^M\nabla$ augmented by its effect on the time component $\nabla_{\partial_t} u = [\partial_t, u]$ for vectors on this bundle, and extended by zero outside the bundle. We are given a smooth map between Riemannian manifolds $f : (M, g) \to (N, h)$ and consider its time dependent variant $f : M \times  I \to N$ . The map induces the pullback bundle $f^*TN$ over $M \times I$ , and consider on it the pullback connection. The Energy $E$ is defined as the total density $$E(f) = \frac{1}{2}\int_M e(f) \: d\mu(g) = \frac{1}{2}\int_M\langle f_*, f_*\rangle \: d\mu(g)$$ We use coordinates $\{x_i\}$ on $M \times I$ and $\{y^\alpha\}$ on $N$ . We also use the indices to denote components. For instance in coordinates, we have $f_* = (f_*)_i^\alpha dx^i \otimes (\partial_\alpha)_f$ . I have a question regarding the motivation behind the gradient descent flow : By a direct computation as done in section 3.2.1, the authors show that $$ \frac{d}{dt} E(f) = -\int_M \langle f_*\partial_t, \Delta_{g,h}f\rangle \: d\mu(g). $$ Then they go on like this Note that $f_*\partial_t$ is the variation of $f$ . Hence the gradient of E, with respect to the inner product of $f^*TN$ , is $-\Delta_{g,h}f$ and the gradient descent flow is $$ f_*\partial_t = \Delta_{g,h}f.$$ First, I do not understand why is the gradient of $E$ is $-\Delta_{g,h}f$ . Second, how does this imply the following of the statement? I have another question regarding the evolution of the energy density : The authors show that the evolution equation for $f_*$ is given by $$ (\Delta_{\partial_t} f_*)(\partial_i) = (\Delta_* f)(\partial_i) + g^{kl}R^N(f_*\partial_k, f_*\partial_i)(f_*\partial_l) - g^{kl}f_*(R^M(\partial_k, \partial_l)).$$ From that, they infer that $$\frac{d}{dt}e = \langle f_*, \Delta f_*\rangle + g^{kl}g^{ij}R^N(f_*\partial_k, f_*\partial_i, f_*\partial_l, f_*\partial_j) - g^{kl}h_f\left(f_*\left((^M\mathrm{Ric})_k^{\:\,m}\partial_p\right), f_*\partial_l\right). $$ Here is my attempt for the second term : By unravelling the definition for the scalar product, we get \begin{multline} g^{kl}g^{ij}(h_{\alpha\beta})_f(f_*)_i^\alpha[R^N(f_*\partial_k, f_*\cdot)(f_*\partial_l)]_j^\beta = g^{kl}g^{ij}h_f\left((f_*)_i,R^N(f_*\partial_k, f_*\partial_j)(f_*\partial_l)\right) = g^{kl}g^{ij}R^N(f_*\partial_k, f_*\partial_j, f_*\partial_l, f_*\partial_i).\end{multline} For the third term. Here is my attempt : By unravelling again, we get \begin{multline} g^{kl}g^{ij}(h_{\alpha\beta})_f (f_*)_i^\alpha[f_*(R^M(\partial_k, \cdot)\partial_l)]_j^\beta = g^{ij}h_f\left((f_*)_i, g^{kl}f_*((R^M)_{kjl}^{\:\:\:\:m}\partial_m\right) \\ = - g^{ij}h_f\left((f_*)_i, f_*(g^{kl}(R^M)_{jkl}^{\:\:\:\:m}\partial_m\right) = g^{ij}h_f\left((f_*)_i, f_*(g^{kl}(R^M)_{jk}\!\,^m_{\:\:\,l}\partial_m\right) = g^{ij}h_f\left((f_*)_i, f_*((^M\mathrm{Ric})_j^{\:\,m}\partial_m)\right) = g^{kl}h_f\left(f_*\partial_l, f_*((^M\mathrm{Ric})_k^{\:\,m}\partial_m)\right). \end{multline} Are those two computations correct?","I am reading now the book The Ricci Flow in Riemannian Geometry by Ben Andrews and Christopher Hopper.

88,Do linearly independent vector fields with vanishing Lie bracket always have integral manifolds which are level sets?,Do linearly independent vector fields with vanishing Lie bracket always have integral manifolds which are level sets?,,"Suppose I have a smooth distribution on an open subset of $M = R^n_{++}$ consisting of $n-1$ vector fields $X^i$ . I know three things about this distribution: At each point $p \in M$ the set $(X^1_p,\ldots,X^{n-1}_p)$ is linearly independent and so spans an $(n-1)$ -dimensional subspace of $R^n$ . For each pair $i,j, \; 1 \leq i < j \leq n-1, \; [X^i,X^j] = 0$ (so the system is in involution). At each point of $M$ the normal to the subspace spanned by this system is non-negative, with the last coordinate strictly positive. By 2, Frobenius tells us this system is integrable with its integral manifolds forming a foliation of $M$ . I understand this also means that there are local coordinates $x^i$ such that $X^i = \partial/\partial x^i$ . I have two questions: In this particular case does there always exist a single function $f: M \rightarrow R$ (smooth or not) such that the integral manifolds (hypersurfaces) are level sets of $f$ ; i.e. each leaf $L$ of the foliation is of the form $f^{-1}(x)$ for some $x \in R$ ? Is each leaf $L$ of the foliation globally the graph of some function $h:D \rightarrow R$ (i.e. $L = (x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1},h(x_1,\ldots,x_{n-1}))$ where $D$ is some domain in $R^{n-1}$ ? My sense is that the first statement is not true but (because of the third assumption) that the second is. As to 1., it has been suggested to me that if I looked at the distribution from the perspective of the normal field (i.e. 1-form approach) that my assumption that the Lie bracket vanishes is equivalent to the ""well-known"" integrability conditions insuring there exists a function f with the required property, but I'm not sure this is right. I would appreciate any insight into this (surely) simple issue that I'm just not seeing. Edit : In case it helps I can give a concrete example of the vector fields I'm working with when $n=3$ . $X^1 = (-m(x_1,x_2,x_3),1, 0), \; X^2 = (-n(x_1,x_2,x_3),0,1)$ .

94,The Lie algebra of vector fields preserving a tensor,The Lie algebra of vector fields preserving a tensor,,"Let $\alpha$ be a tensor field on a manifold $M$ , compact and without boundary. Denote by $\mathrm{Diff}(M,\alpha)$ the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$ preserving $\alpha$ , i.e. $f:M\to M$ such that $f^*\alpha=\alpha$ . I am interested in the Lie algebra of this group; the tangent space at the identity is given by a subset of vector fields, those satisfying $\mathcal{L}_X\alpha=0$ . I am trying to prove that this set of vector fields is a Lie subalgebra of the vector fields on $M$ ; in other words, I want to show that if $X$ and $Y$ preserve $\alpha$ then also $\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}\alpha=0$ . One possible way to do it is to express the flow of $[X,Y]$ using the flows of $X$ and $Y$ , as $$\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]}\alpha=\partial_{t=0}\Phi^{[X,Y]}_t{}^*\alpha.$$ It might be difficult to express $\Phi^{[X,Y]}_t$ as a combination of $\Phi^X_t$ and $\Phi^Y_t$ , but in fact we just have to do it to first order in $t$ , as is explained in this question , for example. Writing $$\Phi_t^{[X,Y]}=\Phi^X_{\sqrt{t}}\circ\Phi^Y_{\sqrt{t}}\circ\Phi^X_{-\sqrt{t}}\circ\Phi^Y_{-\sqrt{t}}+O(t^2)$$ it seems to follow easily that $\partial_{t=0}\Phi^{[X,Y]}_t{}^*\alpha=0$ , since each of the flows preserves $\alpha$ . So, a first question is: is this reasoning correct? I am however interested in proving the identity directly, through a computation in local coordinates. This is motivated by the fact that, in the context of symplectic geometry, it is possible to directly compute in coordinates for example that Hamiltonian vector fields form a Lie algebra, even showing identites like $[X^\omega_f,X^\omega_g]=X^\omega_{\{f,g\}}$ (up to a sign depending on your conventions).

95,Why is there a 1/2 coefficient for the curvature formula in the Wikipedia Curvature Form article?,Why is there a 1/2 coefficient for the curvature formula in the Wikipedia Curvature Form article?,,"The formula for the principal curvature form in the Wikipedia article Curvature Form, when applied to the $X, Y$ tangent vectors to the principal bundle $P$ , goes on like $$\Omega(X, Y)=d\omega(X, Y)+\frac12[\omega(X), \omega(Y)]$$ where $\omega$ is the connection form with value in the lie algebra of the structure group. It only depends on the lie bracket of the lie algebra, not on any conventional definition of the wedge product of forms Having learned that there is no $\frac12$ coefficient, I was about to edit the article when I saw a caveat from the authors ""do not remove the $\frac12$ coefficient"". They did motivate its presence by a correct calculation made from the definition given in the article Lie-Algebra Valued Forms of Wikipedia where there is a $\frac1{(p+q)!}$ coefficient in front of the definition of the wedge product of two lie-algebras valued forms. This definition is different from the one I saw in Michor's book Natural Operations in Differential Geometry, Cap. 19, or other textbooks, where the coefficient is $\frac1{p!q!}$ . This explain the difference in the formula for the curvature. What is right? It seems to me that there should be no such a coefficient $\frac12$ and that I should edit the article on Lie-Algebra Valued Forms. Am I right? Edit 2 Well, the only explanation that makes sense for me is the following: the authors of the article are using an ""old"" convention for the definition of the exterior derivative of a one form, following there the one given in the Kobayashi & Nomizu book they referred to in a note. In this book, the convention used put a $\frac1{p+1}$ in front of the definition of the exterior derivative of a $p$ -form compare to the ""modern"" definition. So, for the connection form , we have a $\frac12$ coefficient in the formula $$d\omega(X,Y)=\frac12(X.\omega(Y)-Y.\omega(X)-\omega([X,Y]))$$ With this convention, it is easy to see that the formula for the curvature given in the Wikipedia article is right, albeit giving a curvature that is half of the modern definition for it. Having two competing definitions for such an important and basic operator is a source of confusion and waste of time IMHO. I will definitely go for the ""modern"" approach. Thus, I just edited the wikipedia article with a reference to the choice of convention made for the exterior derivative definition, following my answer. It seems so me the safest path of action, since getting rid of the $\frac12$ coefficient would have implied a change in other articles. Therefore, my remaining questions are now 1/ is my reasoning right? 2/ is there any rationale behind the choice of the Kobayashi convention for the exterior derivative versus the modern one or is it just a matter of convention? In any case, the choices of some wikipedia articles (like Curvature Form, or Lie-Algebra Valued form, etc.) of the Kobayashi convention is confusing when it is not clearly specified.","The formula for the principal curvature form in the Wikipedia article Curvature Form, when applied to the tangent vectors to the principal bundle , goes on like where is the connection form with value in the lie algebra of the structure group.

Therefore, my remaining questions are now 1/ is my reasoning right? 2/ is there any rationale behind the choice of the Kobayashi convention for the exterior derivative versus the modern one or is it just a matter of convention? In any case, the choices of some wikipedia articles (like Curvature Form, or Lie-Algebra Valued form, etc.) of the Kobayashi convention is confusing when it is not clearly specified.","X, Y P \Omega(X, Y)=d\omega(X, Y)+\frac12[\omega(X), \omega(Y)] \omega \frac12 \frac12 \frac1{(p+q)!} \frac1{p!q!} \frac12 \frac1{p+1} p \frac12 d\omega(X,Y)=\frac12(X.\omega(Y)-Y.\omega(X)-\omega([X,Y])) \frac12","['differential-geometry', 'curvature', 'principal-bundles']"

I now want to show the following well-known equation: $$TE_M \cong TM \oplus E$$ I've seen it done with short exact sequences, but I wonder if it can be done more elementary: Let $s : M \hookrightarrow E$ be the zero section (i.e. $s(x) = 0 \in E_x$ ), then we get for each $x\in M$ the direct sum $E_x = \{0\} \oplus E_x = s(x) \oplus E_x$ , so: $$E= s(M) \oplus E$$ For the tangent bundle, this means (identifying $x = s(x)$ ) $$T_{x}E = T_{x}s(M) \oplus T_{x}E \cong T_xM \oplus E_x,$$ since $s(M) \cong M$ and $T_xE = T_x E_x \cong E_x$ as it is a vector space.

99,Do Carmo Chapter 8 Exercise 2,Do Carmo Chapter 8 Exercise 2,,"The statement is : Show that if $M^k$ is a closed, totally geodesic submanifold of $H^n$ (hyperbolic $n$ space), then $M^k$ is isometric to $H^k$ . My friend and I thought to use the ""Cartan Theorem"". This requires setting notation. Let $M$ and $\tilde{M}$ be two $n$ -dimensional Riemannian manifolds, say $p \in M$ and $\tilde{p} \in \tilde{M}$ are arbitrary points. Choose a linear isometry $i:T_pM \rightarrow T_{\tilde{p}}\tilde{M}$ Let $V \subset M$ be a normal neighborhood of $p$ small enough so that $\exp_{\tilde{p}}$ is defined on $i \circ \exp_p^{-1}(V)$ . Define a map $f:V \rightarrow \tilde{M}$ by $f(q) = \exp_{\tilde{p}} \circ i \circ \exp_p^{-1}(q)$ for $q \in V$ . Now, for all $q \in V$ , there exists a unique unit-speed geodesic $\gamma:[0,t] \rightarrow M$ such that $\gamma(0) = p$ and $\gamma(t) = q$ . Denote by $P_t$ the parallel transport along $\gamma$ from $\gamma(0)$ to $\gamma(t)$ . Define another map $\phi_t:T_qM \rightarrow T_{f(q)}\tilde{M}$ by: $\phi_t(v) = \tilde{P}_t \circ i \circ P_t^{-1}(v)$ for all $v \in T_qM$ where $\tilde{P}_t$ is the parallel transport along the normalized geodesic $\tilde{\gamma}:[0,t] \rightarrow \tilde{M}$ given by $\tilde{\gamma}(0) = \tilde{p}$ , $\tilde{\gamma}'(0) = i(\gamma'(0))$ . Finally, denote by $R$ and $\tilde{R}$ the curvature tensors for $M$ and $\tilde{M}$ respectively. We can now state Cartan's Theorem: With notation as above, if for all $q \in V$ and all $x,y,u,v \in T_qM$ we have: $\langle R(x,y)u,v \rangle = \langle \tilde{R}(\phi_t(x), \phi_t(y))\phi_t(u), \phi_t(v) \rangle$ then $f:V \rightarrow f(V) \subset \tilde{M}$ is a local isometry, and $df_p = i$ . Our work: I've heard that in negative curvature, things like conjugate points aren't a problem, and the injectivity radius is large or infinity, so I figured $\exp$ would be a global diffeomorphism for $H^n$ (which I didn't confirm). The hope was that the $f$ in Cartan's Theorem could give us an isometry onto $H^n$ . We looked at choosing the linear isometry $i$ to be the inclusion of the tangent space of the submanifold $T_pM^k$ restricted to its image in $T_pH^n$ . In that case, since the second fundamental form vanishes because $M^k$ is totally geodesic, the curvature tensors are equal via the Gauss formula. $\phi_t$ ends up being the identity (again, vanishing second fundamental form -> same covariant derivatives -> same parallel transport) with this choice of $i$ , and so the hypotheses of the theorem are met, and we get that $f$ is an isometry. Because of the way $f$ is defined, and since we chose the tangent space inclusion as $i$ , I believe this only shows that $M^k$ is isometric to its image in $H^n$ , which is not enough. I thought that maybe we could choose $i$ to be a different isometry whose image is all of $T_pH^n$ , but it seems obvious that this would fail to preserve length, or even be a diffeomorphism if $n \neq k$ . Maybe another approach would be to show that the image of $f$ is clopen in a connected manifold? We aren't sure where to go next. Everything we've done so far has only relied on ""totally geodesic"", so we need to bring in properties of hyperbolic space somehow. Thoughts? Edit: I've also realized that they aren't asking for an isometry onto $H^n$ , they're asking for an isometry onto $H^k$ . I think our proof works when $n = k$ because the tangent space inclusion is a linear isomorphism (if $\exp$ really is a global diffeo). I wonder what you get when exponentiating subspaces of a tangent space in $H^n$ ?
