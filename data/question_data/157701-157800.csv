3,Calculating sum formulas $\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^n$,Calculating sum formulas,\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^n,"I think I've found a way to calculate a general formula for $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^n$ . Here is how I did it: Notice that $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^n-{(i-1)}^n=x^n$ Here the difference of polynomials will be very useful, if we want $i^n$ to appear here all we have to do is to take the polynomials of degree $n+1$ , let's see that in two examples. A) Let's calculate $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i$ , notice that we want the degree $1$ to appear, so we will take difference of polynomials of degree $2$ here as follows: $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^2-{(i-1)}^2=x^2$ Notice that this is the same as: $\sum_{i=1}^{x} (2i-1)=x^2$ Here we can do some arrangements to get: $2\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}i-\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x^2$ . It is easy to see that $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x$ , if we substitute this in we get: $\displaystyle\left(2\sum_{i=1}^{x} i\right) -x=x^2$ and if we do the algebra here we finally get: $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}i=\frac{x^2+x}{2}$ B) Let's calculate $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^2$ , but for the sake of the post let's do that inline. We take the difference of polynomials of degree $3$ here to get $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^3-{(i-1)}^3=x^3$ , expanding the polynomials and simplifying gives us the equation $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} 3i^2-3i+1=x^3$ , this is the same as $3\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^2-3\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i+\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x^3$ , here we have found at A) that $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}i=\frac{x^2+x}{2}$ , if we substitute this in and substitute $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x$ we get $3\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^2-3.\frac{x^2+x}{2}+x=x^3$ , from this we get $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^2=\frac{x^3-x}{3}+\frac{x^2+x}{2}$ . This method can be generalized for any $n$ as follows: $\sum_{i=1}^{x}i^n=\frac{x^{n+1}+\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left( \sum_{j=2}^{n+1}\left({n+1 \choose j}i^{n+1-j}.(-1)^j\right)\right)}{n+1}$ .

12,For what $p$ is there a $d$ where $x^3+d$ is Hamiltonian in ${\mathbb Z}/p$?,For what  is there a  where  is Hamiltonian in ?,p d x^3+d {\mathbb Z}/p,"Definitions Let $p$ be a prime, and let $f:{\mathbb Z}/p\to{\mathbb Z}/p$ be a function. Then we say that $f$ is Hamiltonian in ${\mathbb Z}/p$ if the directed graph of $f$ is just one cycle --- a Hamiltonian cycle. To be explicit, let $G$ be the directed graph whose nodes are the residues modulo $p$ , and whose arcs are $x\to f(x)$ . Then we say that $f$ is Hamiltonian in ${\mathbb Z}/p$ if $G$ is just a Hamiltonian directed cycle. Question So, for which prime $p$ is there a $d\in{\mathbb Z}/p$ where $f(x)=x^3+d$ is Hamiltonian in ${\mathbb Z}/p$ ? My thoughts $p=1\mod 6$ is no good, because only a third of the non-zero residues modulo $p$ are cubes. Such cubics exist for the simple cases $p=2, 3$ . So for any chance of such $d$ existing with $p>3$ , $p=-1\mod 6$ . I note that $x^3-d$ is Hamiltonian iff $x^3+d$ is, so only half the residues modulo $p$ need be tested as values for $d$ . Examples: $p=2, 3, 11, 47, 59, 71, 83, 131, 167, 251, 311, 347, 443, 467,\dots$ (not in OEIS). I note from brute force search that if $p=5\mod 12$ , there are no such $d$ . ( $p\leqslant 31121$ checked so far.) How come? Such a $p$ is the sum of two squares but I don't see how that would imply my observed result. The nearest approaches I've found are when $f$ is a $p-1$ -cycle and a fixed point; this happens when $(p, \pm d)=(29, 2), (29, 7), (41, 11), (41, 19)$ . Broadening the scope to cubics $f(x)=ax^3+d$ might be useful. Fix $p$ , and suppose $f(x)=a_0x^3+d_0$ is Hamiltonian. Then, by replacing each element $x$ in the cycle by $kx$ for some non-zero constant $k$ , we get the function $g(x)=a_0 k^{-2}x^3+kd_0$ . This shows that if such cubics exist, their respective values for $a$ are either the squares or the non-squares modulo $p$ . Every non-zero residue is a possible value for $d$ ; for example, by taking $k=d_0^{-1}$ we get $g(x)=a_0 d_0^2+1$ . Now for some prime $p=5\mod 12$ some cubics $f(x)=ax^3+d$ are Hamiltonian, but in every case I've found, the values of $a$ are the non-squares modulo $p$ . Examples: $p=5, 29, 101, 137, 149, 173, 197, 233, 257, 269,\dots$ (not in OEIS). That is, the $(p,a)$ where $ax^3+d$ is Hamiltonian modulo $p$ for some $d$ are in two classes: $p=-1\mod 12$ so $-1$ is not a square modulo $p$ ; $a$ is a square modulo $p$ $p=5\mod 12$ so $-1$ is a square modulo $p$ ; $a$ is not a square modulo $p$ So in each case if $ax^3+d$ is Hamiltonian, $-a$ is not a square modulo $p$ . Alternatively (if this is conceptually better) if $-a$ is a square modulo $p$ , $ax^3+d$ as a permutation is not Hamiltonian but has two or more cycles. The parity of the number of cycles of $f$ Denote the number of cycles of $f$ by $C(f)$ . After some testing I make the following conjecture. For given prime $p=5\mod 6$ , and given $a$ , as $d$ varies, with $f(x)=ax^3+d$ , the parity of $C(f)$ is invariant. The value of $C(f)$ might be different for different $d$ , but the parity is the same. For given $p$ and $a$ , $C(x\to ax^3+d)$ being odd doesn't guarantee a $d$ where $C(x\to ax^3+d)=1$ , but if $C(x\to ax^3+d)$ is even for any $d$ , then, for every $d$ , it is not 1. A cycle of length $l$ is $l-1$ transpositions. So, if $f$ is a $p$ -element permutation consisting of $C(f)$ cycles, then $f$ is $p-C(f)$ transpositions. So, if $p$ is odd, then $f$ and $C(f)$ have opposite parity. So we have Hamiltonian $f$ only if we have odd $C(f)$ and thus even $f$ . It turns out that the conditions determining this parity are easily stated (though I have no proof): If $p=-1\mod 6$ , and $f(x)=ax^3+d$ , then $C(f)$ is even iff $-a$ is a square modulo $p$ . This is independent of $d$ . $f$ is Hamiltonian only if $C(f)$ is odd, but I don't know of sufficient, or further necessary, preconditions. Iterates of $f$ ; any use? Because I'm only considering primes $p$ as moduli, $f$ is Hamiltonian iff $f(0)\ne0$ and $f^p(0)=0$ , where $f^p$ means $p$ iterations of $f$ . But I can't see how to exploit this given that $f(x)$ is more complicated than $ax+b$ or $ax^k$ . Literature? I haven't found any published literature on such functions. Perhaps I am not using the correct word? I have borrowed the term ""Hamiltonian cycle'' from graph theory. What is the corresponding term in the theory of permutations or permutation functions? ""Cycle'' and "" cyclic permutation '' do not restrict to cycles which involve all the elements in the permutation set. Or perhaps Hamiltonian functions are just not distinctive among permutation functions, so whether or not one is Hamiltonian is as unpredictable as, say, whether or not a prime is a Mersenne prime's exponent?

First look at the difference equation: $$ 24a^2=u^2-t^2 \tag 2 $$ and use the method of parametrization of the pythagorean triples for $b^2 = c^2-a^2$ [which comes out to be $(a,b,c)=(n^2-m^2,2nm, n^2+m^2)$ (wikipedia)] such that I arrive at $$ u=2m^2+3n^2 \\ t=2m^2-3n^2 \\ a= nm \tag 3 $$ Expansion shows that it is indeed a solution for (2) $$ 24m^2n^2 \overset{?}= (2m^2+3n^2)^2-(2m^2-3n^2)^2 = 12m^2n^2- (-12m^2n^2) = 24m^2n^2 \tag 4 $$ But while this shows solutions for the difference -eq (2) it is easy to see, that this parametric solution for $(a,b,c)$ cannot at the same time be a solution for the first equation $$   24 a^2+1 = t^2 \tag {5a} $$ which leads to $$ 24(n^2m^2)  =(2m^2-3n^2)^2 -1 \tag {5b}$$ This has no solution which can be seen when taken $\pmod 5$ . $\qquad \qquad \qquad $ update2: this is corrected from previous version after helpful comment of user servaes, see revision history So my conclusion on my scribble notes was first: no solutions, simply :-)) ... But actually there are known solutions for the simultaneous system, namely, $(a,t,u)=(0,\pm1,\pm1)$ and $(\pm1,\pm5,\pm7)$ and thus it looks, as if my approach is useless here and should be discarded. My ansatz, second part: In a second look on it, after some coffee,  I see that this ansatz can be revived, if we allow non-integer values for $(m,n)$ . For instance $(m,n)=(\sqrt 3,\frac1{\sqrt 3})$ gives $(a,t,u)=(\frac {\sqrt 3}{\sqrt 3},2\cdot 3-\frac33, 2\cdot 3+ \frac33 )=(1,5,7)$ . Analoguously $(m,n)=(\frac1{\sqrt 2},\sqrt 2,)$ gives $(a,t,u)=(\frac {\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2},\frac22-3\cdot2, \frac22+ 3 \cdot2)=(1,-5,7)$ . In this example, the values $\sqrt3$ and $\sqrt 2$ are quite obvious when eq's (3) are considered. But to allow irrational numbers in that well known and such commonly used parametrization of the pythagorean triples shall likely have many more implications- but which I do not see here, even if we uset the restriction that the irrational values have to be selected in a way that $(a,t,u)$ are still all integer. This is surely of importance, if I want to use the full logic of my small approach for other, but comparable, cases like $Aa^2+1=t^2 ; Ba^2+1=u^2$ . Q1: can the introduction of that irrational values be understood as meaningful generalization of the Pythagorean-triple parametrization? Q2: under the assumption of quadratic irrational values for $(n,m)$ - can we still prove, that the set of solutions is that set of the two which are already known?","In reviewing & improving my attempt to solve the question on simultaneous Pell-equations (see here in MSE ) I came across a detail which has surely wider implications and which I cannot encompass (correct term?) so far.

For example, when $n=9$ we get $\sigma_1(9) = 1+3+9=13$ . Define $D(x) = \sum_{n=1}^x\sigma_1(n)$ . Varius methods are known for computing $D(x)$ , most rely upon the crucial observation that summing the divisors themselves rather than looking at each number and its divisors specifically, we get a faster computation. That is: $$D(x) = \sum_{d=1}^x d \cdot \bigg \lfloor \frac xd \bigg \rfloor$$ Simply put, for each divisor, we multiply the divisor by the amount of times it appears. This form addresses an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ computation. But noticing the floor function is constant for large ranges, it admits a faster, $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/2})$ computation: $$D(x) = \sum_{d=1}^{ \big\lfloor \frac {x}{\sqrt x+1} \big \rfloor} d \cdot \bigg \lfloor \frac xd \bigg \rfloor + \sum_{d=1}^{\sqrt x} d \cdot \Bigg (T \bigg(\bigg \lfloor \frac nd \bigg \rfloor \bigg ) - T \bigg(\bigg \lfloor \frac n{d+1} \bigg \rfloor \bigg ) \Bigg )$$ where $T(n)= \frac {n\cdot(n+1)}2$ is the $n$ 'th triangular number. Further simplifaction can result in an algorithm of similiar time complexity, but still noticably faster: $$D(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor} \left( k \cdot \left \lfloor {\frac{x}{k}} \right \rfloor  + T \left( \left \lfloor{\frac{x}{k}} \right \rfloor \right) \right) - T(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor) \cdot \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor$$ Using the last formula, I can compute the correct result for $D(10^{18})$ in about 3.5 minutes (using Java). However, in https://oeis.org/search?q=87%2C8299&language=english&go=Search , (in the links section) terms up to $D(10^{36})$ are known.

Examples of things I am looking for : @GEdgar's comment suggests that the question may not be clear to some hence I am giving some examples. I was working with inverse of the zeta function in real $x > 1$ . For every $x > 1$ we can show using the Stieltjes series expansion of the Riemann zeta function about $s = 1$ that there exists a constant $0 < c_x < 1-\gamma$ such that $\zeta(1 + \frac{1}{x-1+c_x}) = x$ hence a first approximation is $\zeta^{-1}(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{x-\gamma} + O(\frac{1}{x^2})$ .

48,Criteria for Leyland Numbers to be Prime,Criteria for Leyland Numbers to be Prime,,"Inspired by a Black Pen Red Pen video on Youtube where he proved that $4^{2019}+2019^4$ is not prime using the Sophie Germain identity, I began exploring when numbers of the form $a^b+b^a;a,b\in\mathbb{N}$ are prime.  Without loss of generality, I restrict it to $a\leq b$ . It is trivial to see that there are an infinitude of primes where $a=1$ .  I then discovered from OEIS that numbers of the form $a^b+b^a;a,b\in\mathbb{N}\setminus1$ are called Leyland numbers, and that the sequence of known Leyland primes (in addition to 3) is sequence A094133 on OEIS, and can be found on Leyland's website in a table along with Leyland PRPs. http://www.leyland.vispa.com/numth/primes/xyyx.htm . What I wanted to do is to find criteria that will indicate whether or not a Leyland number is prime.  The first obvious criteria I found is that if $GCD(a,b)=n>1$ , then $a^b+b^a\equiv0 \mod n$ , and therefore $a,b$ must be coprime.  The second obvious criteria was that $a+b$ must be odd, because otherwise $a^b+b^a$ would be even. I then proceeded to explore further to try to find limitations on which values for $a$ will never result in a Leyland prime, and if there were any values of $a$ for which a prime or composite number for $b$ will always or will never return a Leyland prime. What I have found so far: For $a=2$ , a necessary condition for $a^b+b^a$ to be prime is that $b\equiv3\mod 6$ , because if $b$ is even then $a^b+b^a$ will also be even, and if $b$ is odd but not divisible by 3, then $a^b+b^a$ will be divisible by 3.  However, the condition that $b\equiv3\mod 6$ is not sufficient for $a^b+b^a$ to be a Leyland prime, as for example $2^{27}+27^2=73\times521\times3529$ . For $a=4$ , there are no Leyland primes.  This can be proven, as for odd $b$ , $4^b+b^4$ is factorable using the Sophie Germain identity, and for even $b$ , $4^b+b^4$ is even. For $a=6$ , I have not found any Leyland primes, but cannot prove that they don't exist.  As $a,b$ must be coprime, we get that $b$ must be odd but not divisible by 3.  An additional criteria is that $b$ must be divisible by 7, because $6^b\equiv-1\mod7$ for any odd $b$ , and $b^6\equiv1\mod7$ for any $b$ which is not divisible by 7.  Therefore, all that remains is to test for $b\equiv7\mod42$ and $b\equiv35\mod42$ .  Looking at the table on Leyland's website, I have not found any pattern that I can use to prove that there are no such Leyland primes, although if any exist, they must be with $b>7500$ or slipped through the cracks of the computations. All other single digit numbers produce at least one Leyland prime, but I do not see any pattern to determine when they will or won't produce Leyland primes (other than the trivial criteria mentioned above).

I have proved the case for $k=2$ as follows:  Suppose $g(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a perfect square for all integer values $x$ . Let $f(x,t)=y^{2}-g(x)$ . Note that we either have that $f$ is irreducible, in which case we have $$f(x,y)=y^{2}-g(x)$$ or $f$ is reducible, giving $$f(x,y)=(y-A(x))(y-B(x))$$ for some functions $A(x),B(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ . Expanding out the latter case we get the following: \begin{equation*} \begin{split} y^{2}-g(x) & = (y-A(x))(y-B(x)) \\  & = y^{2}-(A(x)+B(x))y+A(x)B(x). \end{split} \end{equation*} Comparing $y$ coefficients we deduce that $A(x)=-B(x)$ , thus \begin{equation*} \begin{split} y^{2}-g(x) & = (y-A(x))(y-A(x)) \\  & = y^{2}+A^{2}(x)  \end{split} \end{equation*} $$\implies g(x)=A^{2}(x)$$ Now suppose $f(x,y)=y^{2}-g(x)$ is irreducible. Then by Hilbert's Irreducibility Theorem there exist infinite $x_{0}$ such that $f(x_{0},y)=y^{2}-g(x_{0})$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[y]$ . By definition of $g(x)$ we have that $g(x_{0})=a_{0}^{2}$ for some $a_{0} \in \mathbb{Z}$ and hence $$f(x_{0},y)=y^{2}-a_{0}^{2}=(y-a_{0})(y+a_{0})$$ which is reducible in $\mathbb{Z}[y]$ giving a contradiction. Thus $g(x)=h^{2}(x)$ for some $h(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ When trying to generalise this to higher $k$ , I can only seem to get a result if $y^{k}-g(x)$ has a linear factor in $y$ , i.e. $$f(x,y)=(y-h(x))(y^{k-1}+g_{k-2}(x)y^{k-2}+\ldots+g_{1}(x)y+g_{0}(x))$$ for some $h(x),g_{i}(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ . We can then use induction to find $g(x)=h^{k}(x)$ . My arguement seems to break down for $k=4$ as if $$y-g(x)=(y^{2}+A(x)y+B(x))(y^{2}+C(x)y+D(x))$$ Then we find $g(x)=B^{2}(x)$ but this does not seem to show that $g(x)$ is a 4th power of another polynomial.

I will go through some of its lines and ask my questions in what follows. Let $K$ be a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ and $G_K$ denote its absolute Galois group. We start with a $\mathbb Q_p$-algebra $B$, endowed with a $G_K$ action. The author also assumes that (1) $B$ is a domain such that $\text{Frac}(B)^{G_K}=B^{G_K}$ (2) If $y\in B$ is such that the line $\mathbb Q_p\cdot y$ is stable under $G_K$, then $y\in B^{\times}$. I am not exactly sure in (1) what $G_K$-action are we assuming on $\text{Frac}(B)$, but I suppose it is expected one by declaring $\sigma\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right):=\dfrac{\sigma(a)}{\sigma(b)}$. To me it seems that condition $(1)$ means that $B^{G_K}\subset B^{\times}$. The other condition is clear. Next, if $V$ is $p-$adic representation of $G_K$, we let $D_B(V):=(B\otimes_{\mathbb Q_p}V)^{G_K}$ and this is a $B^{G_K}$ vector space. Then the author continues: There is a natural map    $$ \alpha: B\otimes_{B^{G_K}} D_B(V)\rightarrow B\otimes_{\mathbb Q_p}V $$ By condition (1) above the map is injective. I assume this map should be given by $\alpha(b\otimes v)=bv$. But I don't understand how does condition $(1)$ imply its injectivity. Finally, the above injectivity implies that $\dim_{B^{G_K}} D_B(V)\le \dim_{\mathbb Q_p}V$ and if equality holds, the author calls $V$ to be $B$-admissible. He claims: $V$ is $B-$admissible iff $\alpha$ is surjective. I do understand the converse direction, but I still can't prove the opposite.

I am not exactly sure in (1) what $G_K$-action are we assuming on $\text{Frac}(B)$, but I suppose it is expected one by declaring $\sigma\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right):=\dfrac{\sigma(a)}{\sigma(b)}$. To me it seems that condition $(1)$ means that $B^{G_K}\subset B^{\times}$. The other condition is clear. Next, if $V$ is $p-$adic representation of $G_K$, we let $D_B(V):=(B\otimes_{\mathbb Q_p}V)^{G_K}$ and this is a $B^{G_K}$ vector space. Then the author continues: There is a natural map    $$ \alpha: B\otimes_{B^{G_K}} D_B(V)\rightarrow B\otimes_{\mathbb Q_p}V $$ By condition (1) above the map is injective. I assume this map should be given by $\alpha(b\otimes v)=bv$. But I don't understand how does condition $(1)$ imply its injectivity. Finally, the above injectivity implies that $\dim_{B^{G_K}} D_B(V)\le \dim_{\mathbb Q_p}V$ and if equality holds, the author calls $V$ to be $B$-admissible. He claims: $V$ is $B-$admissible iff $\alpha$ is surjective. I do understand the converse direction, but I still can't prove the opposite.

In an actual paper for updating the key sizes, there is a twist of $E$ defined, given by $E'(\F_{p^2}):\ y^2=x^3+2^{1/4}x$ . [4] I would like to understand how they come to that twist, and how to define the homomorphism or isomorphism $E\to E'$ . My attempt is the following: I thought about using $\F_{p^{16}}\cong \F_{p^2}[x]/(x^8-2^{1/2})$ . Choosing $u\in \F_{p^{16}}$ such that $u^8=2^{1/2}$ leads to: $u=2^{1/16}$ . Now I don't know how to get further or what to aim. There is a small hole in my notes and I can't find anything to fit. Details [1] solves the primary question, where [2] throws up an extended question: Are twists usable for speeding up by the GLV/GLS Method? Required stuff We could consider the affine equation for an elliptic curve and use proposition X.5.4 from [3] or the projective way, given in [1] on page 138 ff. and use a dehomogenization. The problem I've met is, that Silverman only define twists of degree 2,3,4 and 6. But this time, this is a twist of degree eight. (Octic twist?) Let me repeat the given stuff first: Preliminaries Elliptic Curve $E(\F_p):\ y^2=x^3+x$ Prime $p\equiv \pm 3\bmod 8$ Twist $E'(\F_{p^2}):\ y^2=x^3+2^{1/4}x$ Embedding degree $k=16$ Discriminant $D=1$ $j$ -Invariant: $j_E=12^3$ Definition 1: Degree of a Twist Let $E(\F_p)$ be an elliptic curve. The degree of its twist $E'(\F_{p^{k/d}})$ is defined by the integer $d$ . Proposition 2: [3] Prop. X.5.4 Let $char(\F_p)>3$ and let $n=\begin{cases} 2 & if j_E\neq 0,12^3\\ 4 & j_E=12^3\\ 6 & j_E=0.\end{cases}$ Then the twists of E are canonically isomorphic over the algebraic closure of $\F_p$ . More precisely, in our situation of $E$ , we have the twist $E'_d$ corresponding to $m\in\F_p^*$ given by: (i) $E'_m:\ y^2=x^3+m^2Ax+m^3B$ if $n=2$ (ii) $E_m:\ y^2=x^3+mAx$ if $n=4$ and (iii) $E_m:\ y^2=x^3+mB$ if $n=6$ . Proposition: Projective version [1] Let $E:\ Y^2Z=X^3+AXZ^2+BZ^3$ with $A,B\in\F_p$ . For any $d\in\F_p^*$ all twists of $E$ corresponding to $d$ are given by: $E_d:\ dY^2Z=X^3+AXZ^2+BZ^3$ or by change of variables $dZ\leftrightarrow Z$ $E_d:\ Y^2=X^3 + \frac{A}{d^2}XZ^2 + \frac{B}{d^3}Z^3$ which becomes isomorphic to $E$ over any field, where $d$ is a square. Application We have $E:\ y^2=x^3+x$ , that means $A=1, B=0$ . Furthermore, the Twist, we want to reach is given by $E':\ y^2=x^3+2^{1/4}x$ . Therefore $m=2^{1/8}$ and $d=(1/2)^{1/8}$ . The missing degree eight twist is the only obstacle right now. But, if we consider $\F_{p^{16}}\cong \F_{p^2}[t]/(t^8-2)$ , we would get the equation $t^8=2$ , where $t\in\F_{p^{16}}$ and 2 should be not a square in $\F_{p^2}$ , but indeed $\sqrt{2}\in\F_{p^2}$ , since $2\in\F_p$ is a non-square if $p\equiv \pm 3 \bmod 8$ and we have $\F_{p^{16}} \cong \F_p[X]/(X^{16}-2)$ . Missing Answere Is this an octic twist as given in [4, Section 6.3]? How to compute it then? I thought about $t^8=\sqrt{2}$ which would lead to $t=2^{1/16}$ and, therefore, $E_t:\ Y^2=X^3 + 2^{1/8}XZ^2$ , what is not $2^{1/4}$ . If this is a typo and, therefore, a quartic twist, it is solved then.

Obviously, $a_0=-1$ and $a_2=7$ is of the form $8k^2-1$. How do I prove that these are the only solutions?",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'contest-math', 'pell-type-equations']"

Hence, since every PID is a UFD the equality holds for every PID with the same proof.
