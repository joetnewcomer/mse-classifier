0,On the centralizers of $n$-cycles and conjugacy in $A_n$,On the centralizers of -cycles and conjugacy in,n A_n,"I'd appreciate comments on the validity of these attempted proofs.  Thanks. Let $a$ be an $n$-cycle in $S_n$. a) Show that the centralizer of $a$ in $S_n$ is $\langle a \rangle$. b) Assume that $n$ is odd.

Since two elements of $S_n$ are conjugate iff they have the same cycle type, $|\mathrm{cl}(a)|=(n-1)!$ (where $\mathrm{cl}(a)$ is the conjugacy class of $a$).  But $|\mathrm{cl}(a)|=|S_n:C_{S_n}(a)|$, or $|C_{S_n}(a)|=\frac{|S_n|}{|\mathrm{cl}(a)|}=\frac{n!}{(n-1)!}=n$.  Since $\langle a \rangle \le C_{S_n}(a)$, it follows that $\langle a \rangle = C_{S_n}(a)$. b) since $n$ is odd, all $n$-cycles are contained in $A_n$, so $A_n$ contains $(n-1)!\,\,$ $n$-cycles.  Since, for $a \in S_n$, $C_{A_n}(a)=C_{S_n}(a) \cap A_n = \langle a \rangle \cap A_n$, we have $|\mathrm{cl}_{A_n}(a)|=|A_n:C_{A_n}(a)|=\frac{\frac{1}{2}n!}{n}=\frac{n!}{2n}=\frac{1}{2}(n-1)!$, and so $a$ cannot be conjugate to all $(n-1)!$ $n$-cycles in $A_n$ and there exists such an element $b$.","I'd appreciate comments on the validity of these attempted proofs.

Serre's algebraic variety",,"Anyone who has ever tried to study algebraic geometry has experienced the phenomenon of being burdened by countless types of varieties (variety, affine variety, projective variety, quasi-affine variety, quasi-projective variety, algebraic variety, abstract variety) and having a hard time remembering how you have defined the geometric object you are actually studying. Worse, the terminology from one author to the next can be different (allowing reducible, etc.). Most of this is fine for me, as I have been dealing with it for some time now. I am currently working through Serre's FAC and I am hoping someone can help me 1. Sort out the taxonomy of things we are studying that have 'variety' in the name, 2. Understand the axioms required in his definition and 3. explain some historical context of how Serre's algebraic variety fits into the evolution of the geometric object of interest at a given point in time throughout algebraic geometry, from the most classical zariski closed subsets to certain types of schemes. In section 34, page 40, Serre gives his definition of an `Algebraic Variety'. If my understanding is correct, he wants this thing to be his ultimately general geometric object that we will study, and possibly refine to special cases later. As examples he says 'any locally closed subspace of an affine space with zariski topology is an algebraic variety and any projective variety is an algebraic variety'. I think he is using the term projective variety in the classical sense here. What this means to me is that all the usual varieties (closed subsets of affine space with zariski) are algebraic varieties, all the complements of usual varieties are algebraic varieties (do we really want to allow this?) and any true quasi-affine variety (the intersection of zariski open and closed) is an algebraic variety. And any (classical) projective variety is an algebraic variety. So this algebraic variety object has encompassed all the classical things, and then some. Later it seems we refine our interest back to some classically geometric things, or perhaps find the link between the new abstract thing and the old intuitive thing, by defining an algebraic variety to be affine if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of an affine space (so all the usual affine varieties) and defining an algebraic variety to be projective if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of projective space. However, I believe there are examples that these definitions do allow for affine algebraic varieties that did not come from classical affine varieties? I believe the affine line without its origin is one such example? Since it is isomorphic to something cut out by a polynomial? So even when restricting to affine and projective algebraic varieties, we have enlarged the concepts a bit (for better or for worse?) ? Now can we talk about the actual definition of an algebraic variety? He defines it to be the following data a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf $\mathscr{O}_X$ that is a subsheaf of the sheaf of germs of functions on $X$ with values in $K$ there exists a finite open cover of $X$ such that each cover element is isomorphic to a locally closed subspace $U_i$ of an affine space equipped with the sheaf $\mathscr{O}_{U_i}$ . The diagonal of $X \times X$ is closed in $X \times X$ . Combining 1 and 2 I feel like he is basically saying we need the object to be a locally ringed space that is obtained by gluing together quasi affine varieties? Am I way off here? Is there more subtlety to this? And what is the purpose of 3? Out of all the axioms this is the only one that is really just baffling to me. What does this axiom do for us? Also, how does this definition of an 'algebraic variety' fit into the evolution of algebraic geometry?

In the chapter Polynomial Ring of the book Linear Algebra of Hoffman Kunze it is explained a little. $x$ is considered as a vector $( 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0$ $(n$ times $) ) $ and so not an element of the ring or the field on which the polynomial ring is constructed. $x^k$ can also be expressed similarly as a vector having $1$ at the $k$-th position and all other terms are $0$. In analysis when we consider polynomial function we just use $x$ as a dependent variable may be real or a complex. It may be different in Algebra. Please explain the difference and similarity of the two concepts. Thanking you very much.","I am currently studying polynomial ring. I have a basic doubt. What is $x$ in a polynomial?
