0,Half-life versus relaxation time,Half-life versus relaxation time,,"Question: What is the exact relationship between half-life and relaxation time? I just wanted to nail down the difference/similarity between these two concepts. I did a web search, and even found a direct reference, but it was an exercise in an on-line textbook asking exactly what I am asking, and I copied and pasted that exercise question as my question above. Now, we all know that half-life is the time it takes for the substance to decay to half its size, and relaxation time is the time it takes for the substance to decay to 1/e of its size, so why have both concepts? My guess is that it is similar to the difference between degree measure and radian measure: Half-life is useful when dealing with specific practicalities, whereas relaxation time is more convenient when discussing theory.

2,How do I learn to stop worrying and love the substitution $y'' = y' (dy'/dy)$,How do I learn to stop worrying and love the substitution,y'' = y' (dy'/dy),"The following is a solution of the differential equation $y'' = y$ with initial values $y(0) = 3$ , $y'(0) = 1$ . Considering $y$ to be a function of $x$ and omitting some standard details: Let $z = y'$ . Then $y'' = \frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \frac{dy}{dx} = z \frac{dz}{dy}$ . Substituting, $z\frac{dz}{dy} = y$ is separable with initial value $y = 3$ , $z = 1$ , so has the unique solution $z = \sqrt{y^2 - 8}$ . Now the equation $y' = \sqrt{y^2 - 8}$ with initial value $y(0) = 3$ has solution $y = 2e^x + e^{-x}$ , which is also a solution to the original problem. While this does produce the correct answer, the step using $\frac{dz}{dy}$ is unjustified. One way to fill this gap is to note that since $y'(0) \ne 0$ , the inverse function theorem says that locally $x$ and therefore $y'$ is in fact a (smooth) function of $y$ . This is somewhat implicitly used in picking the positive branch of the square root $\sqrt{y^2 - 8}$ . But I do not know how to justify the definition of $z$ as a function of $y$ and therefore of $\frac{dz}{dy}$ if you change the initial values to something like $y(0) = 2$ , $y'(0) = 0$ . The solution does have $y$ an invertible function of $x$ but this is not known a priori . If you just blindly work through the integration without worrying you still get the solution $y(x) = e^x + e^{-x}$ , no matter which branch of the square root $\pm \sqrt{y^2 - 4}$ you pick (and in fact $y'$ changes sign near $x = 0$ , so neither of these is valid even locally). Is there a way to make this work rigorously? Or are there similar equations and initial values where this substitution misses a solution? I'm not so worried about it introducing extraneous solution although I do not have an example of that either. I originally learnt this solution in high school from a physics-y book that did not justify the differentiability, as is usual in high school level physics-y books. Actually in that book the original solution was for the simple harmonic motion equation $y'' = -\omega^2 y$ but, as I noticed later, the same substitution seems to help with some other second order ODEs too.","The following is a solution of the differential equation with initial values , .

3,Method of finding solution of $y'=y+e^x$,Method of finding solution of,y'=y+e^x,"( Edited after serious comments from Chongxu Ren, Ulrich, Gerry Myerson etc ; thanks to them for bringing my attention to put the question in precise form) I am trying to find the solution of differential equation $y'=y+e^x$ for $x\in\mathbb{R}$ . This can be solved by using method of integrating factor; but without referring to it, I went for looking solution step-by-step with complexity, as follows. Simple Case: If it would have been $y'=e^x$ , i.e. $Dy=e^x$ , we could have taken integration of both sides to get $y=ae^x+b$ . (The method of integrating factor brings above equation to form $D(e^{-x}y)=1$ ) General Case: The right side is not only the function of $x$ , but some terms of the (unknown) function $y$ also; an easy example is the equation in title. We then move to collect terms of $y$ on one side, and keep function of $x$ other side. We can write main equation as $$(D-\mathbf{1})y=e^x,$$ and we want to invert $D-\mathbf{1}$ to get information of unknown $y$ . [In case $Dy=f(x)$ , we expect to get $y=\int f(x)$ , provided, $f(x)$ satisfies some conditions on given domain of it.] For $(D-\mathbf{1})y=e^x$ , I went to do like: $y=\frac{1}{D-\mathbf{1}}e^x= (\mathbf{1}+D+D^2+\cdots )(-e^x)$ . But, this last expression on RHS does not make sense since $D^n(-e^x)=-e^x$ for all integers $n\ge 0$ .

I know that the Green's function is going to satisfy the same boundary conditions and de ODE: $$\frac{d^2G(x,t)}{dx^2}=\delta(x-t)$$ And I also know that $\frac{d^2G(x,t)}{dx^2}=0$ for $x\neq y$ . So I first solved the ODE on the region $0\leq x<t$ : $$G(x,t)=Ax+B$$ Apllying the boundary condition $G(0,t)=0$ , it implies $B=0$ and thus $G(x,t)=Ax$ For the region $t<x\leq 1$ : $$G(x,t)=Cx+D$$ Applying the boundary condition $G(1,t)=0$ , it implies $C=-D$ and thus $G(x,t)=C(x-1)$ . $$   G(x,t) =   \begin{cases}                                    Ax & \text{if $x<t$} \\                                    C(x-1) & \text{if $x>t$} \\   \end{cases} $$ To determine $A$ and $C$ , I integrated $\frac{d^2G(x,t)}{dx^2}=\delta(x-t)$ over a small iterval that included $x=t$ : $$\lim_{\epsilon\to0}\int_{t-\epsilon}^{t+\epsilon}\frac{d^2G(x,t)}{dx^2}=\frac{dG(x,t)}{dx}\Bigg\rvert_{x=t^+}-\frac{dG(x,t)}{dx}\Bigg\rvert_{x=t^-}=C-A=1$$ thus $C=1+A$ . Since both sides pieces of $G(x,t)$ must be equal at $x=t$ : $$At=C(t-1)=(1+A)(t-1)\Rightarrow A=t-1\ \text{and}\ C=t$$ Thus the Green's function is: $$   G(x,t) =   \begin{cases}                                    x(t-1) & \text{if $x<t$} \\                                    t(x-1) & \text{if $x>t$} \\   \end{cases} $$ After finding the Green's function, I have to find the solution for de ODE when $g(x)=\sin(\pi x)$ , thus: $$f(x)=\int_{0}^{1}G(x,t)g(t)dt=(x-1)\int_{0}^{x}t\sin(\pi t)dt+x\int_{x}^{1}(t-1)\sin(\pi t)dt$$ After computing the integral, I got: $$f(x)=-\frac{1}{\pi^2}\sin(\pi x)$$ But it isn't the correct answer, according to my book it should be $$f(x)=\frac{1}{\pi^2}\sin(\pi x)$$ I'm just missing the minus sign, what am I doing wrong?

9,Discontinuous solution to first order ODE with delta function coefficients,Discontinuous solution to first order ODE with delta function coefficients,,"Consider the following first-order ODE: $$y'(x) = f'(x) y(x);$$ this has solution $y(x) = C e^{f(x)}$.
