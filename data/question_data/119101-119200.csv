Why does  trace another conic?",A B C C P Q AP\cap BQ,"At first, there are a fixed conic curve $\Gamma$ and three fixed collinear points $A,B,C$ . Draw a moving straight line $l$ through point C, intersecting $\Gamma$ at two points $P,Q$ . Find the two intersections $S=AP\cap BQ$ and $T=AQ\cap BP$ . As line $l$ move, $S$ and $T$ generate a locus $\Delta$ . Due to symmetry, $S$ and $T$ must have a common locus. I found that $\Delta$ will be a new conic curve. So the question is: why this is true? Use knowledge harmonic point sequences, the intersection of $ST$ and $AB$ is a fixed point $D$ that form a harmonic point sequences $[A,B;C,D]$ together with points $A,B,C$ . Suppose that $C$ is outside of $\Gamma$ . Make two tangent lines $CM,CN$ from $C$ to $\Gamma$ . Then the line $MN$ is the polar of $C$ in $\Gamma$ . Let $E$ be the intersection of $MN$ and $l$ . Through the image we can guess these two are right: $E$ is also the intersection of $MN$ and $ST$ . $DM,DN$ also tangent to $\Delta$ . The proof of the first guess is not too hard. Let $E'$ be the intersection of $ST$ and $l$ , then all that need to do is to prove $E=E'$ . According to the property of pole $C$ and polar $MN$ , $[C,E;P,Q]$ is a harmonic point sequences; according to the property of complete quadrangle $[A,B;P,Q;S,T]$ , $[C,E';P,Q]$ is also a harmonic point sequences; these two facts indecate $E=E'$ . The second guess suggest that $[C,\Gamma,P,Q]$ and $[D,\Delta,S,T]$ may be symmetric. This inspired me to turn to find that what's the relation between $\Gamma$ and $C,M,N$ . Or, if three points $C,M,N$ have been given, what conditions should a point $P$ meets in order to the locus of $P$ is a conic curve tangenting $CM,CN$ at $M,N$ . If this is finded, we can transfer the condition from $P$ or $Q$ to $S$ or $T$ , then $S$ or $T$ must meet the same condition and the locus of $S,T$ must be a conic curve tangenting $DM,DN$ at $M,N$ . The ratio $\dfrac{\overline{ME}}{\overline{EN}}$ uniquely determines the position of $E$ on $MN$ ; the position of $E$ determine the line $l$ ; and the other ratio $\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}$ also uniquely determines the position of $P$ on $l$ . So these two ratio must have a relation when $P$ moving on a fixed conic curve $\Gamma$ . By attempting on some special curve, I find this theorem: Theorem: Let $E$ be a moving point on $MN$ , and $P$ a point on $CE$ , then the locus of $P$ is a conic curve if and only if this equation holds: $$ \left(\frac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\right)^2\frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2}=\text{Const}$$ If the Theorem is true, by Menelaus's Theorem on triangle $\triangle CED$ and transversal line $PSA$ we know $\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\times \dfrac{\overline{ES}}{\overline{SD}}\times \dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}=-1$ . So there is $\dfrac{\overline{DS}}{\overline{SE}}= -\dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}} \times\dfrac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}$ in which $-\dfrac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}$ is contant.Then $$ \left(\frac{\overline{DS}}{\overline{SE}}\right)^2 \frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2}= \left(\frac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{AC}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{\overline{CP}}{\overline{PE}}\right)^2 \frac{\overline{ME}\overline{EN}}{\overline{MN}^2} =\text{Const}$$ and give what I want. Now I have these questions: How to prove the above theorem? How to explain the above theorem? How to prove the same problem when $C$ is inside of $\Gamma$ ?, excluding use the space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ . Is there another way to prove the problem Do I find this fact that collinear $A,B,C$ transform $\Gamma$ to a new conic curve $\Delta$ first?

The first integral above calculates the solid angle subtended by the upper hemispherical cap surface area  while the second one calculates the angle subtended by the surface area of the $0$ to $\pi$ the right of the axis (speaking loosely). Now of course they should match due to the isotropy of the sphere and other obvious things. The problem I face is this: What part of the convention (of choosing the co-latitude, as I have done) makes, an attempt to calculate the same thing like this: $$\Omega\int_{0}^{\pi}\,d\phi \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\,sin\theta \,d\theta   $$ futile ? Since this i integral is obviously zero. Now this might sound like a stupid question and it probably is but it bugs me. It is obvious on one hand that since $\sin $ is an odd function about 0 so the area under its curve gets cancelled in the full-wave from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$ thus giving zero. But on the other hand it seems that nothing of the clockwise-anticlockwise convention seems to stop me from writing the wrong integral and getting the wrong answer. Probably in the last integral the half azimuthal ring at a particular positive value of the co-latitude gets cancelled by the half azimuthal ring at the negative of that co-latitude value (this explanation doesn't seem ryt to me though). To put my rambling into context, This thing came to mind when I was trying to solve a problem where I had to calculate the electric flux through a part of a sphere. For that I needed to find the solid angle subtended by the shaded surface area. Did it as follows: $\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\,d\phi \int_{\pi/2-\alpha}^{\pi/2}\,sin\theta \,d\theta  $ which yields $\pi\sin\alpha$ This was listed as the correct option even when at $\alpha=\pi$ it becomes zero instead of $2$ In think this is again related to the fact that co-latitude changes sign to the left of the axis so probably the integral needs to to be split up or something. So to sum up, How would you put the limits for that integral so that it gives $2\pi$ ? (but remember I want the upper part to  become the surface that subtends) Do conventions and the clockwise counter-clockwise messing up is whats confusing me or is it totally unrelated to all of the mumbo-jumbo I said?","When we calculate the solid angle subtended by half a sphere we simply do it as follows: Here,: = co-latitude (clockwise taken positive) = azimuthal angle (anti-clockwise taken positve) Now this can also be calculated as: Here, the azimuthal ring corresponding to a co-latitude just doesn't take a full circle at once but gets added to another equal half from the lower portion in the to part of the co-latitude to give precisely the same thing.

Consider the function $$x\mapsto \frac{|u+xv|-|u|}{x}$$ which is defined for $x>0$ . I'm trying to prove in a purely geometric manner that $$\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{|u+xv|-|u|}{x}$$ exists and is finite. Analytically this is easy (prove that it is a monotonic, bounded function, and hence all one-sided limits exist and are finite), but geometrically (=without resorting to numbers) I was not able to do it. The basic problem is that I cannot plot this function by purely geometric constructions ; from such a plot the existence and finiteness would automatically follow . Can you do it? Philosophical remarks: I'm having a hard time accepting that it's possible to prove this with an analytic argument that lacks any geometric insight - and that it is not possible to also provide a geometric proof. This is because it's usually possible to have both. An example from calculus where both approaches are possible, is analyzing differentiability of a function at a point $x_0$ : The analytic proof there actually has a strong geometric content, since one relies on the geometric plot of the function to see what goes wrong: if it has a kink at $x_0$ or goes to infinity or oscillates, then this information is directly represented and used in the analytic proof. Thus, here the two approach are intimately connected, whereas in my example above they seem to be divorced. This is how far I got in my construction (using Geogebra): Plot the vectors $u$ and $v$ : Then you can trace out, with the green vector arrows, the map $$x\mapsto u+xv$$ (of course this is the line spanned by $v$ , translated via $u$ , but let's pretend we didn't knew this already from experience): Now: Then we obtain a plot of $$x \mapsto \frac{|u+xv|-|u|}{x},$$ and now of course it is easy to ""see"" that the limit exists. Note: Of course one could have obtained this plot in Geogebra, by simply starting to measure the various vector lengths and then dividing that number by the relevant $x$ and marking that spot on the coordinate system (which is probably how Geogebra does it internally).

49,Eccentricity Vector of an Ellipse -- Geometric Derivation?,Eccentricity Vector of an Ellipse -- Geometric Derivation?,,"I've been playing Kerbal Space Program again, and so I'm learning about orbital mechanics. There's a particular vector I can derive physically, but it's an intrinsically geometric object, and so I'd like to find out if there's a purely mathematical derivation of it (e g., no using conservation of energy). Consider an ellipse, with one focus at the origin, and the other on the negative x-axis. Let $\ell$ be its semi latus rectum, and $e$ be its eccentricity. Given a point P on the ellipse, let $\vec r$ be the vector from the origin to P. Draw the tangent ray T to the ellipse at P, and let $\theta$ be the angle it makes with $\vec r$ . Lastly, erect a perpendicular to T at P, with length $\ell/\sin \theta$ , and call it $\vec{q}$ . Claim: $\vec{q} - \vec{r} = re \hat{x}$ . I'm having a lot of trouble with this, primarily because I don't have a good understanding of how $\theta$ varies with P. It starts at 90° at the periapsis, increases up to some unknown value $M$ , goes back down to 90° at apoapsis, and then down to $180° - M$ , before finally returning to 90°. $M$ gets bigger as the ellipse gets more enlongated, but that's all I know about it. I can coordinate bash of course, but I'm hoping for something cleaner. There's gotta be some way to exploit the geometric properties of the ellipse. Here's the physics behind why I care about this, feel free to skip if you're not interested in motivation. From my position and velocity vectors, I'd like to determine my orbit. We know it's an ellipse, because Kepler, so there's only a few things we need to determine: size, shape, orientation. Size is easy to find from the vis-viva equation , which itself comes from conservation of energy. Most of orientation is also easy; the orbital plane is the plane containing our position and velocity vectors, and so it's just the plane normal to $\vec r \times \vec v$ . The remaining information we need to find is the eccentricity $e$ , and how our ellipse is oriented within the orbital plane. We'll encode the latter by an angle $\nu$ , the angle from  periapsis to our position (astronomers call this the ""true anomaly""). There's something in the literature called the ""eccentricity vector"", which is defined as $\vec e = \frac{\vec v \times \vec h}{\mu} - \frac{\vec r}{r}$ , where $\vec h$ is the specific angular momentum $\vec r \times \vec v$ . It allegedly has magnitude $e$ , and makes angle $-\nu$ with our position vector (i.e., this is a positive multiple of the periapsis vector). I don't really have much intuition around this vector. The first component points perpendicularly outward from the ellipse, and somehow the second term is exactly the ""correction"" you need to point along the focal axis. It's not even clear that $\vec e$ is a constant! One nice thing about it though is that it behaves cleanly when the orbit is circular; $\vec e$ will be zero, leaving $\nu$ indeterminate, which makes sense because there's no well-defined periapsis on a circle. To show that this vector is what it promises to be, first, you show it's a constant, by taking the time derivative, and using the conservation of angular momentum. Then, consider the value at periapsis. Velocity is perpendicular to position there, so $h = rv$ , and since both terms point in the right direction, the direction is correct, and the magnitude is $rv^2/\mu - 1$ , which if you plug in $r_{periapsis} = (1-e)a$ and $v_{periapsis}^2 = \frac{\mu}{a} \frac{1+e}{1-e}$ , will yield the eccentricity $e$ . But I feel like you should be able to do this geometrically, via the following interpretation. The semi latus rectum of the ellipse is $\ell = h^2/\mu$ , so the magnitude of $\frac{\vec v \times \vec h}{\mu}$ is $vh/\mu = h/(r \sin \theta) \cdot h/\mu$ , where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec r$ and $\vec v$ . Now we've eliminated all non-geometric quantities like velocity. Scaling the vector by $r$ , to give it units of length, we arrive at the problem above. *""specific"" means ""divided by orbiter mass""","I've been playing Kerbal Space Program again, and so I'm learning about orbital mechanics.

The root of this questioning is that I first dicovered while studying simple neural nets for classification, that in 2D with 3 binary output neurons, where the network is just a linear classificator (no hidden layer), you can get maximum 7 classes, and not 8 (number of possible combinations of 3 binary digits) as expected. As shown on the image, the class 010 is missing. There can also be the case where all three points intersect at the same place and we only get 6 domains but this is of fewer interest for me. I've tried to understand what's going on in two dimensions and I figured out that you can get maximum $n+1$ new domains by adding a straight line, where $n$ designs the number of existing straight lines. It seems to work pretty fine, although I did not prove it (my bad): For all integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of domains that you can get with $n$ straight lines on a plane. $$ \text{Conjecture:}~~~~~~~~~~~\begin{cases} f(0)=1\\ \forall n>0, ~~ f(n)=n+f(n-1) \end{cases} $$ Then I tried to see how the problem looked like in higher dimensions, starting with planes in 3D but it quickly became hard to sketch on a sheet of paper. I defined another function $f_D$ that describes the maximum number of domains you get when cutting a $D$-dimensional space with hyperplanes.

Replace the $p_i$ 's by $p_i - q$ where $q$ is the above norm-minimizer. Compute the orthogonal complement of $span(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ . If $q_1, q_2, \cdots, q_{n-2}$ is a basis for the orthogonal complement then that would give a system of equations describing the circle. $$q_i \cdot (x-p_j) = 0$$ for all $i,j$ (these equations would technically be independent of j). The nice thing about this setup is it's just linear algebra.  One problem with this solution is step (2) -- if the norm-minimizer results in a very small but non-zero norm there might be numerical instabilities.  In the application I have in mind, there will be (potentially) billions of such computations and these kinds of instabilities will be difficult to avoid. The $n=2$ case has a rather cute, stable and efficient solution which (off the top of my head) I don't see how to generalize $$Det \pmatrix{ x & y & z & 1 \cr \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & 1 \cr \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & 1 \cr \cdot & \cdot & \cdot & 1} = 0$$ where you plug the three points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ into the dotted rows.

83,Why can we always draw right triangles for inverse trig functions?,Why can we always draw right triangles for inverse trig functions?,,"In trigonometry it's a basic technique to evaluate an expression like $$\tan\left(\arcsin\left(-\frac{4}{5}\right)\right)$$ by thinking of $\arcsin\left(-\frac{4}{5}\right)$ as an angle, setting  $\arcsin\left(-\frac{4}{5}\right) = \theta$, and drawing a right triangle to determine the solution.

84,Collineations of the unit disk,Collineations of the unit disk,,"I've been reading a proof that all models of Lobachevskian geometry are isomorphic. As part of the proof, the following statement was made, but no proof or reference was given. (The proof can actually be fixed relatively easily so that it doesn't rely on the statement, but I find the statement interesting in its own right.) Any bijection of the disk $x^2 + y^2 < 1$ onto itself that maps chords to chords is projective. This can be restated as follows, viewing the disk as the Klein model of the hyperbolic plane. Any bijection of the hyperbolic plane onto itself that preserves alignment is an isometry. The first statement refers of course to the ordinary Euclidean unit disk. A projective mapping means any mapping of the form $x' = (ax + by + c)/(gx + hy + i), y' = (dx + ey + f)/(gx + hy + i)$. If the unit disk is replaced with the whole plane, then the statement is equivalent to the so-called ""fundamental theorem of affine geometry."" Without loss of generality, we may assume that the origin is fixed (since it can be shown that projective mappings of the required kind exist that take any point to any point) and that the line $y = 0$ is invariant (applying a rotation). In that case, the problem is to show that only four mappings are possible, namely, the identity mapping, reflections with respect to the coordinate axes, and central symmetry with respect to the origin. Really, I'd be happier with a reference than with a proof given here, particularly if the proof is long.
