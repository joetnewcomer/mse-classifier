I have included a definition and theorem that seemed useful. If anyone would be willing to critique or confirm my proof it would really make my day. Thanks in advance. Suppose $X$ is a topological vector space which is of the second category in itself. Let $K$ be a closed, convex, absorbing subset of $X$. Prove that $K$ contains a neighborhood of $0$. Suggestion: Show first that $H = K \cap (-K)$ is absorbing. By a catagory argument, $H$ has interior.

Show that the result is false if $X$ is $L^2$ topologized by the $L^1$-norm Definition: A convex set $K\subset X$ is called absorbing, if given $x\in X$ there exists $\lambda>0$ such that $\lambda x\in K$. Theorem: Suppose $V$ is a neighborhood of $0$ in a topological vector space $X$. If  $$ 0 < r_1 < r_2 < \dots < r_n \rightarrow \infty, then $$  $$ X = \bigcup_n r_n V. $$ Proof: Let $X$ be a topoligical vector space which is of second category in itself. Let $K$ be a closed, convex absorbing subset of $X$. Since $K$ is absorbing, we observe that $X = \bigcup_n nK$. Consider $H = K \cap (-K)$. We observe that $H$ is also a closed convex set since the intersection of convex sets are convex, and finite intersections of closed sets are closed. Since $K\subset X$ is convex  we note that $K$ is second category in its self since $K$ is everywhere dense in its self. We observe that $\overline{H}^\circ \not = \emptyset$ since the intersection of second category sets is second category. Hence H has non empty interior. Since $2H = H+H = H-H$; $H$ must be a neighborhood of $0$. By the theorem stated above, we may say that $H$ is absorbing since $H$ is a neighborhood of $0$. $H \subset K \Rightarrow K$ contains a neighborhood of $0$. To emphasize the requirement of $K$ convex suppose that $X = \mathbb{R}^2$. Suppose $K$ is the set consisting of the whole space with the nonzero points of the parabola $y=x^2$. Then obviously $K$ is absorbing but does not contain a neighborhood of $0$. If $X$ is $L^2$ topologized by the $L^1$ norm consider a set $K = \{f: \|f\|_2 \leq 1\}$ then we notice that $K$ is convex and absorbing, but there exists a sequence of functions $f_n \in X$ with $\| f_n\|_1 = 1/n \rightarrow 0$ and $\| f_n\|_{2} = 2$ for all $n$. So no ball around $0$ can be contained in $K$.","Been sitting on this one for a few days and would really appreciate some help. I have included a definition and theorem that seemed useful.

Show that the result is false if $X$ is $L^2$ topologized by the $L^1$-norm Definition: A convex set $K\subset X$ is called absorbing, if given $x\in X$ there exists $\lambda>0$ such that $\lambda x\in K$. Theorem: Suppose $V$ is a neighborhood of $0$ in a topological vector space $X$. If  $$ 0 < r_1 < r_2 < \dots < r_n \rightarrow \infty, then $$  $$ X = \bigcup_n r_n V. $$ Proof: Let $X$ be a topoligical vector space which is of second category in itself. Let $K$ be a closed, convex absorbing subset of $X$. Since $K$ is absorbing, we observe that $X = \bigcup_n nK$. Consider $H = K \cap (-K)$. We observe that $H$ is also a closed convex set since the intersection of convex sets are convex, and finite intersections of closed sets are closed. Since $K\subset X$ is convex  we note that $K$ is second category in its self since $K$ is everywhere dense in its self. We observe that $\overline{H}^\circ \not = \emptyset$ since the intersection of second category sets is second category. Hence H has non empty interior. Since $2H = H+H = H-H$; $H$ must be a neighborhood of $0$. By the theorem stated above, we may say that $H$ is absorbing since $H$ is a neighborhood of $0$. $H \subset K \Rightarrow K$ contains a neighborhood of $0$. To emphasize the requirement of $K$ convex suppose that $X = \mathbb{R}^2$. Suppose $K$ is the set consisting of the whole space with the nonzero points of the parabola $y=x^2$. Then obviously $K$ is absorbing but does not contain a neighborhood of $0$. If $X$ is $L^2$ topologized by the $L^1$ norm consider a set $K = \{f: \|f\|_2 \leq 1\}$ then we notice that $K$ is convex and absorbing, but there exists a sequence of functions $f_n \in X$ with $\| f_n\|_1 = 1/n \rightarrow 0$ and $\| f_n\|_{2} = 2$ for all $n$. So no ball around $0$ can be contained in $K$.",,"['general-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

29,At most one connected component of unbounded portion of entire function.,At most one connected component of unbounded portion of entire function.,,"Suppose $f$ is an entire complex analytic function and $R$ a positive real number. Define the set $E:= \{z\in\mathbb{C};|f(z)| < R\}$ to be the set of $z$ whose image is bounded by $R$. I want to show that the complement $E^c$ has at most one connected component. $E^c$ has zero components $\iff E^c = \varnothing \iff f$ is bounded by $R \implies f$ is constant. So we can assume $E^c$ has at least one component. If $f$ is instead bounded by a larger constant $S>R$, then $E^c$ will have one component consisting of a single point. So assume $f$ is unbounded. The boundary $\partial E^c = \{z\in\mathbb{C};|f(z)|=R\}$. So if a component $A$ is bounded, then since $|f| \geq R$ in $A$ and $|f|=R$ on $\partial A$, by maximum modulus principle, $f$ is constant in $A$. If $A$ has nonempty interior, this implies $f$ is a constant function. If $A$ has empty interior, then if there is an open neighborhood of $A$ contained in $E$, $f$ will again be constant by the maximum modulus principle. If $A$ has no such open neighborhood, there there must be a sequence in $E^c\setminus A$ converging to a point in $A$, which seems problematic but I'm not sure what else I can say about A. Assuming that every component of $E^c$ must be unbounded and that $E^c$ has more than $1$ component, $E$ must also be unbounded, since if there were an open neighborhood of $\infty$ disjoint from $E$, then all components of $E^c$ would meet near $\infty$. So every open neighborhood of $\infty$ intersects both $E$ and $E^c$. This is enough to show that $\infty$ is an essential singularity of $f$, which implies that $f$ is not a polynomial. Another way to see that $f$ is nonpolynomial is to observe that $E$ and $E^c$ both being unbounded implies that $\partial E^c$ is unbounded, hence noncompact, but $\partial E^c = f^{-1}(\{|z|=R\})$ is the preimage of a compact set. So $f$ is not a proper map and cannot be a polynomial. [EDIT:] The condition on connected components is not something I've used too often, so I don't know many ways to make use of it. An open set is simply connected if and only if its complement in the extended plane is connected, but due to the unboundedness of each component of $E^c$, $E$ will be simply connected. But then we could define logarithms on $E$ if $0\notin E$ (or we could translate $f$ to achieve $0\notin E$). We could take a pair of points $z_1, z_2$ in separate components of $E^c$, which could possibly have been helpful when working with winding numbers of paths in $E$, except here $E$ is simply connected. So this isn't useful because there is a natural bijection between paths $\gamma\subset E$, up to homotopy, and functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying a Hölder continuity condition with constant $\alpha>1$, up to $\mathbb{R}$-scalar multiplication. At this point I can't figure out anything else about $f$. What to do?","Suppose $f$ is an entire complex analytic function and $R$ a positive real number.

I want to show that the complement $E^c$ has at most one connected component. $E^c$ has zero components $\iff E^c = \varnothing \iff f$ is bounded by $R \implies f$ is constant. So we can assume $E^c$ has at least one component. If $f$ is instead bounded by a larger constant $S>R$, then $E^c$ will have one component consisting of a single point. So assume $f$ is unbounded. The boundary $\partial E^c = \{z\in\mathbb{C};|f(z)|=R\}$. So if a component $A$ is bounded, then since $|f| \geq R$ in $A$ and $|f|=R$ on $\partial A$, by maximum modulus principle, $f$ is constant in $A$. If $A$ has nonempty interior, this implies $f$ is a constant function. If $A$ has empty interior, then if there is an open neighborhood of $A$ contained in $E$, $f$ will again be constant by the maximum modulus principle. If $A$ has no such open neighborhood, there there must be a sequence in $E^c\setminus A$ converging to a point in $A$, which seems problematic but I'm not sure what else I can say about A. Assuming that every component of $E^c$ must be unbounded and that $E^c$ has more than $1$ component, $E$ must also be unbounded, since if there were an open neighborhood of $\infty$ disjoint from $E$, then all components of $E^c$ would meet near $\infty$. So every open neighborhood of $\infty$ intersects both $E$ and $E^c$. This is enough to show that $\infty$ is an essential singularity of $f$, which implies that $f$ is not a polynomial. Another way to see that $f$ is nonpolynomial is to observe that $E$ and $E^c$ both being unbounded implies that $\partial E^c$ is unbounded, hence noncompact, but $\partial E^c = f^{-1}(\{|z|=R\})$ is the preimage of a compact set. So $f$ is not a proper map and cannot be a polynomial. [EDIT:] The condition on connected components is not something I've used too often, so I don't know many ways to make use of it. An open set is simply connected if and only if its complement in the extended plane is connected, but due to the unboundedness of each component of $E^c$, $E$ will be simply connected. But then we could define logarithms on $E$ if $0\notin E$ (or we could translate $f$ to achieve $0\notin E$). We could take a pair of points $z_1, z_2$ in separate components of $E^c$, which could possibly have been helpful when working with winding numbers of paths in $E$, except here $E$ is simply connected. So this isn't useful because there is a natural bijection between paths $\gamma\subset E$, up to homotopy, and functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ satisfying a Hölder continuity condition with constant $\alpha>1$, up to $\mathbb{R}$-scalar multiplication. At this point I can't figure out anything else about $f$. What to do?",,"['general-topology', 'complex-analysis']"

While pondering this today, I realized that these estimates could be bypassed if continuity and differentiability were defined in terms of topological and geometrical properties of the graph. If $f : X \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is invertible then $\Gamma_f = \{(x, f(x)) : x \in X\} \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\Gamma_{f^{-1}}$ are related by an isometry, so a characterization of continuity and differentiability in terms of a function's graph would immediately imply that $f$ is continuous or differentiable iff the same is true for $f^{-1}$. With a single variable, we have the characterization that $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous iff its graph is connected and closed in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

With this, we have a completely qualitative proof of the inverse function theorem for one variable. Assume $f$ is continuously differentiable and that $f'(x_0) \neq 0$. By continuity of $f'$, we see that $f'$ has constant sign in a neighborhood of $x_0$. Therefore $f$ is locally monotone and hence invertible on that neighborhood. As f is continuous and differentiable and we've defined these properties in terms of graphs, it follows that this local inverse is likewise continuous and differentiable since the two graphs are reflections. What about definitions for the general case of $f : X \subset \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$? Well, the definition of differentiability is easily extended.

Thanks in advance. Here is my proof. The absolute value sign ""$ \left| {x} \right|$"" stands for the standard Euclidean norm. Proof: Let $J \subseteq \Bbb R^p$ be an open ball. Then there exists $r \gt 0$ such that  $J = \{ y \; | \; \left| { y - x} \right| \lt r\}$ for some point $x \in J$. For every point $ y \in J$, $ \; r_y = r - \left| { y - x} \right| \gt 0 $. Consider the open ball $J_y = \{ z \; | \; \left| { z - y} \right| \lt  r_y  \}$ centered  at $y$. $ \; z \in J_y \implies \left| { z - y} \right| \lt r_y \implies \left|{(z - x) - (y - x)}\right| \lt r_y$ $\implies \left|{z - x}\right| - \left|{ y -x}\right| \lt r - \left| { y - x} \right| \implies z \in J \implies $ there is an open ball centered at every point $y \in J_y$ entirely contained in $J_y$. Therefore an open ball is an open set. And since the union of any collection of open sets is open in $\Bbb R ^ p$, the union of countably many open balls is an open set in $\Bbb R ^ p$. Let $G$ be an open set. The set $\{ a_n \}$ of all points in $G$ with rational coordinates is countable. Since each $a_n \in G$ there corresponds an open ball centred at $a_n $entirely contained in G. Let $B_n$ be the largest of these open balls. We shall prove that $$G = \bigcup_{n \in \Bbb N} B_n$$ Since $B_n \subseteq G \;\;\; \forall n \in \Bbb N$, the union is trivially contained in $G$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, .., x_p) \in G$. Then there is an open ball $B_x = \{ y \in \Bbb R ^ p \ | \ \left| {y - x} \right| \lt  r_x (\gt 0) \}$ centred at $x$ entirely contained in $G$. If $ a_t = (t_1, t_2,.., t_p)$ where $t_i$ is a rational number in the open interval $(x_i - \frac {r_x}{3\sqrt p}, x_i +  \frac {r_x}{3\sqrt p}) $, then since; $$\left| {a_t - x} \right| = \sqrt { \sum_{i=1}^p  (t_i - x_i)^2} \lt \sqrt { \sum_{i=1}^p \frac {(r_x)^2}{ 9p}} \lt r_x$$ $a_t \in B_x \subseteq G$. $B_t$ is the largest open ball centred at $a_t$ entirely contained in $G$. Consider the open ball centred at $a_t$, $K = \{ (l_1, l_2,.. , l_p) \ | \ \left| {l_i - t_i} \right| \lt  \frac {r_x}{2\sqrt p}\}$.

66,Definition of the higher dimensional mapping tori,Definition of the higher dimensional mapping tori,,"This is proving harder to search for than I imagined. The usual definition of a mapping torus $\mathcal{M}_h$ associated to a homeomorphism $h\colon X\rightarrow X$ on a topological space $X$ is the quotient of the product $X\times I$ by the equivalence relation given by $(x,1)\sim_h (h(x),0)$ .

The existence of a point $x_1 \in X$ with $0<|x_1-x_0|<\epsilon_1=1$ is guaranteed. Now take $\epsilon_2=|x_1-x_0|/2$ and choose an $x_2 \in X$ with $0<|x_2-x_0|< \epsilon_2$. In general, choose $x_n \in X$ that satisfies $0<|x_n-x_0|< \epsilon_n=\frac{|x_1-x_0|}{2^n}<\frac 1{2^n}$. It is clear that $x_n \rightarrow x_0$ and $x_n \neq x_0$ for $n=1,2,...$ Question: Is this correct?","My question is about characterizing accumulation points in terms of convergent sequences in a set $X$.

97,Is the pre-image of a cellular map a CW complex?,Is the pre-image of a cellular map a CW complex?,,"In general, if we have a map between CW-complexes, $f:X\to Y$, and $f$ is cellular, then is is clear that $f^{-1}(Y)$ (the inverse image, $f$ is not invertible in general) is also a CW-complex? Since it's cellular, $f^{-1}(Y^n)$ must by closed and must contain $X^n$.  I'm not sure what else I can say.  Something about it intersecting a finite number of cells? Ultimately, I am trying to use this to prove the following for CW-spectra: Let $f:E\to F$ be a function of spectra (in the strict sense here) and $F'$ be a cofinal subspectrum of $F$.  Then there is a cofinal subspectrum $E'$ of $E$ such that $f$ maps $E'$ into $F'$. My initial intuition was to show that $f^{-1}(F')$ was the desired subspectrum, but I got stymied at the very first step because I don't know much about CW spectra.  I guess I could just work with nice spaces or something to simplify this... Thanks!
