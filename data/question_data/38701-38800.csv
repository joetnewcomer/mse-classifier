3,Is the product of all positive rational numbers equal to one?,Is the product of all positive rational numbers equal to one?,,"I've started reading Pinter's Book of Abstract Algebra , and one of the early exercises calls for a proof that in a finite abelian group $G$, $(a_1a_2a_3a_4...a_n)^2 = e$, if there are any $a_n$ that are their own inverses, and that if no $a_n$ is its own inverse, then $(a_1a_2a_3a_4...a_n) = e$. Since I'm not doing this for a class, I worked out a very informal proof for the second case (no $a_n$ is its own inverse): Since there must be an $a^{-1}$ for each $a$, then $(a_1a_2a_3a_4...a_n)$ can be reduced to so many instances of $(a_1a_1^{-1}a_2a_2^{-1}...a_{n/2}a_{n/2}^{-1})$, which can be simplified to $e^{n/2}$, or just $e$.

(2) Internal product: The internal product of subgroups $A$ and $B$ is $AB = \left\{ ab \:{:}\: a \in A, b \in B \right\}$. (3) Sum: The sum of subgroups A and B is $A + B = \left\{ a + b \:{:}\: a \in A, b \in B \right\}$.

I know that for there to be surjectivity between $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $\mathbb{Z}^m$ $n$ must be greater than or equal to $ m$ and for there to even be $m \times m$ minors $n$ again must be greater than or equal to $ m$, so I just assume this throughout.

We can consider the $n$ columns of $A$ as column vectors $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$. These $n$ column vectors live in $\mathbb{Z}^m$. Let $S'' = \{ v_i\}$ and then let $S'$ be subsets of $S''$ of cardinality $m$ and lastly let $S$ be the elements of $S'$ such that when the $m$ $v_i$ vectors are considered as $m\times m$ matrices, the determinant is not zero, thus $S$ consists of all $m\times m$ minors of $A$ with non-zero determinant (we ignore zeroes since they do not affect gcd). For each $s\in S$ define a map $i_s: \mathbb{Z}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n$ that maps the standard basis of  $\mathbb{Z}^m$ to the basis elements $e_k \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $v_k \in s$. That is, $\phi \circ i_s$ gives the matrix created by the column vectors of  $s$. Let $\Lambda$ be the lattice Im$\phi \supset \sum_{s\in S}$ Im $\phi\circ i_s =\sum_{s \in S} \Lambda_s$.

Thanks!","I am trying to find an elementary proof that if $\phi$ is a linear map from $\mathbb{Z}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^m$ represented by an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, then the map is surjective iff the gcd of the determinants of all the $m\times m$ minors of $A$ is $1$. I know that for there to be surjectivity between $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $\mathbb{Z}^m$ $n$ must be greater than or equal to $ m$ and for there to even be $m \times m$ minors $n$ again must be greater than or equal to $ m$, so I just assume this throughout. I sort of have one direction $\Leftarrow$ i) Greatest Common Divisor =1 implies surjectivity: First observe that the if $ | \mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M)| < \infty$ then $|\det M| = | \mathbb{Z}^m/ Im(M) |$ otherwise $\det(M) = 0$ where $M$ is an $m\times m$ matrix. We can consider the $n$ columns of $A$ as column vectors $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$. These $n$ column vectors live in $\mathbb{Z}^m$. Let $S'' = \{ v_i\}$ and then let $S'$ be subsets of $S''$ of cardinality $m$ and lastly let $S$ be the elements of $S'$ such that when the $m$ $v_i$ vectors are considered as $m\times m$ matrices, the determinant is not zero, thus $S$ consists of all $m\times m$ minors of $A$ with non-zero determinant (we ignore zeroes since they do not affect gcd). For each $s\in S$ define a map $i_s: \mathbb{Z}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^n$ that maps the standard basis of  $\mathbb{Z}^m$ to the basis elements $e_k \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $v_k \in s$. That is, $\phi \circ i_s$ gives the matrix created by the column vectors of  $s$. Let $\Lambda$ be the lattice Im$\phi \supset \sum_{s\in S}$ Im $\phi\circ i_s =\sum_{s \in S} \Lambda_s$. Thus $\forall s \in S$,  $\Lambda_s \subset \Lambda \subset \mathbb{Z}^m$.

Does every Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group contain an element that is not contained in any other Sylow $p$-subgroup? Or does there exist a group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroups $P, P_1, \ldots, P_s$ such that $P$ is contained in $P_1 \cup \ldots \cup P_s$? One immediate observation here is that if a Sylow $p$-subgroup contains an element that is not contained in any other Sylow $p$-subgroup, then the same is true for every other Sylow $p$-subgroup since they are conjugate. Hence we only need to check the statement for one Sylow $p$-subgroup. I've tried different approaches to this problem but I don't think I have found out anything useful so far. Some special cases where the statement is true is when there are $\leq p + 1$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, or when the Sylow $p$-subgroups are cyclic. The reason I am assuming that $p$ is odd because there are counterexamples when $p = 2$.

Does every Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite group contain an element that is not contained in any other Sylow $p$-subgroup? Or does there exist a group $G$ with Sylow $p$-subgroups $P, P_1, \ldots, P_s$ such that $P$ is contained in $P_1 \cup \ldots \cup P_s$? One immediate observation here is that if a Sylow $p$-subgroup contains an element that is not contained in any other Sylow $p$-subgroup, then the same is true for every other Sylow $p$-subgroup since they are conjugate. Hence we only need to check the statement for one Sylow $p$-subgroup. I've tried different approaches to this problem but I don't think I have found out anything useful so far. Some special cases where the statement is true is when there are $\leq p + 1$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, or when the Sylow $p$-subgroups are cyclic. The reason I am assuming that $p$ is odd because there are counterexamples when $p = 2$.

I'll will discuss a simple situation so we can all share a common context, but my question is less about this particular group, and more about the strategy of showing that a particular mapping you're interested in is a valid homomorphism. Let $G$ be a group, and let a non-identity $(\ne 1)$ element $a \in G$ be such that $a^2=1$.  Then $K:=\left\{ 1, a \right\} \lt G$.  I don't see right away that $K \lhd G$, so I want to find a homomorphism with kernel $K$. If we were to show that $K$ is normal, we would need $gK = Kg$ $\forall g \in G$, but since $g1 = 1g$, this would imply we need $ga = ag$ $\forall g \in G$.  (I point this out because I'll refer back to it later.  I'm willing to hear arguments about $K$ being normal, but that's not the point of this question.)

This would depend on $\phi$ being a homomorphism, and would be an example of assuming the conclusion.  If $\phi$ were a homomorphism and well defined, this would show ... well, I guess it would not show that $ag = ga$, but it would show that $ag$ and $ga$ are both members of the same equivalence class in the quotient group formed by modding $K$ out of $G$.

His provided solutions goes as Since an ideal $I$ is a finite set in this case, it must have a finite set of generators $x_1,\ldots, x_k$. Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the $x_i$. Every element of $I$ is of the form $a_1x_1+\cdots+a_kx_k$, and hence a multiple of $d$. Thus $I\subseteq (d)$. But $d\in I$, because there are integers $a_i$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k a_ix_i=d$.

Now I'm trying to take care of that, but there are some statements I've seen about this group which I don't know how to prove (maybe because I lack some more background in group theory, especially in the study of infinite abelian groups?) Definition A $p$-group is a $p$-Prüfer group if it is isomorphic to $$C_{p^\infty}=\{e^{\frac{2k\pi i}{p^n}}:k\in \mathbb{Z}, n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\} \subset (\mathbb{C}^\times, \cdot)$$ What I'm having trouble to prove is: The following are $p$-Prüfer groups: 1) An infinite $p$-group whose subgroups are totally ordered by inclusion, 2) An infinite $p$-group such that every finite subset generates a cyclic group, 3) An infinite abelian $p$-group such that $G$ is isomorphic to every proper quotient, 4) An infinite abelian $p$-group such that every subgroup is finite Just for the record, what I (think I) could prove was that the following are $p$-Prüfer groups: 5) An injective envelope of $C_{p^n}$, for any $n\geq 1$, 6) A Sylow $p$-subgroup of $\frac{\mathbb{Q}}{\mathbb{Z}}$, 7) The direct limit of $0\subset C_p \subset C_{p^2}\subset ...$ Here $C_{p^n}$ denotes a cyclic group of order $p^n$.

In the process, I found an interesting yet somewhat bizarre algebraic structure to describe what I was doing, and I would like to know if there exists a name for it or if similar structures have been studied previously. What follows is a description of the ""observed properties"" of this algebraic structure.  I'm not currently certain which properties should be considered axioms and which are derived from others. Let $(R, +, \cdot )$ be a set $R$ with two binary operations. Furthermore, each element of this set belongs to one of two possible ""types."" Each element of the first type (to be indicated with a subscript $_0$ such as $a_0$) represents a ""translation,"" while each element of the second type ($a_1$) represents a ""reflection.""  If a subscript is not provided then the relation should hold regardless of the type. Addition acts as a ""list-like"" operator, based on how it interacts with multiplication (described later).  It is associative but not commutative. $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$ When two elements are added, their types xor together. $$a_x + b_y = c_{x \oplus y}$$ Any element added to its negation (additive inverse) results in the identity. $$a + -a = I_0$$ $$a + I_0 = I_0 + a = a$$ Any type-$1$ element is its own negation, as is the identity, but all other type-$0$ elements do not equal their negation. $$a_1 = -a_1$$ $$I_0 = -I_0$$ Swapping the order of operands require that you negate both operands and the expression.  The negation does not ""distribute"" over addition. $$a + b = -(-b + -a)$$ I believe, but am not entirely certain, that $(R, +)$ qualifies as a group. The multiplication operation represents the translation/reflection of one element by/over another: reflection of $a_1$ over $b_1$ $$a_1 \cdot b_1 = c_1$$ $$a_1 \cdot a_1 = a_1$$ translation of $a_1$ by $b_0$ $$a_1 \cdot b_0 = c_1$$ reflection of $a_0$ over $b_1$ $$a_0 \cdot b_1 = -a_0$$ translation of $a_0$ by $b_0$ $$a_0 \cdot b_0 = a_0$$ The identity plays a special role here as well: $$a \cdot I_0 = a$$ $$I_0 \cdot a = I_0$$ Multiplication is a non-associative, non-commutative, yet flexible operation, meaning that the following always holds: $$(a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a)$$ Furthermore, $$(a \cdot b) \cdot -a = (a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a) = a \cdot (b \cdot -a)$$ My somewhat bizarre addition operation was constructed to give multiplication of property of ""folding over"" addition from the left. That is, $$a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$$ $$a \cdot (b + c + d + \ldots + y + z) = a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot \ldots  \cdot y \cdot z$$ I call this ""folding"" based on programming terminology, and I think this property is one of the more interesting ones.  It follows from the above that there is no concept of left(?) division: $$a \cdot (b + a) = (a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a)$$ $$(b + a) \ne (b \cdot a)$$ $$a_0 \cdot b_0 = a_0 = a_0 \cdot c_0$$ $$b_0 \ne c_0$$ Multiplication also distributes right, similar to the concept of ""mapping"" in programming. $$(b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$$ Negating the first argument of a multiplication expression is equivalent to negating the whole expression. $$-a \cdot b = -(a \cdot b)$$ There also also some other useful equations to relate addition, multiplication, and negation: $$-a + b + a = b \cdot a$$ $$a \cdot b = c \leftrightarrow c \cdot -b = a$$ $$a_0 \cdot b = a_0 \cdot -b$$ Again, I am not entirely confident on the self-consistency of these relationships.  I don't have a real axiomatization yet.  With the properties above I've been able to ""prove"" some simple equivalences such as $$c_x \cdot (c_x \cdot a_1) \cdot b_x = c_x \cdot (b_x \cdot a_1 \cdot c_x)$$ which corresponds to this diagram (which uses ""r"" for ""reflection"" instead of ""$\cdot$""): Have similar algebraic structures been named/studied before?  I am particularly interested in structures that obey $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$.  If possible, I would also like to find ways to reduce the role of ""typing"" in the properties listed above.","Today I was toying around with reflecting points over other points, which I expanded to reflecting lists of points over other lists of points.  In the process, I found an interesting yet somewhat bizarre algebraic structure to describe what I was doing, and I would like to know if there exists a name for it or if similar structures have been studied previously. What follows is a description of the ""observed properties"" of this algebraic structure.  I'm not currently certain which properties should be considered axioms and which are derived from others. Let $(R, +, \cdot )$ be a set $R$ with two binary operations. Furthermore, each element of this set belongs to one of two possible ""types."" Each element of the first type (to be indicated with a subscript $_0$ such as $a_0$) represents a ""translation,"" while each element of the second type ($a_1$) represents a ""reflection.""  If a subscript is not provided then the relation should hold regardless of the type. Addition acts as a ""list-like"" operator, based on how it interacts with multiplication (described later).  It is associative but not commutative. $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$ When two elements are added, their types xor together. $$a_x + b_y = c_{x \oplus y}$$ Any element added to its negation (additive inverse) results in the identity. $$a + -a = I_0$$ $$a + I_0 = I_0 + a = a$$ Any type-$1$ element is its own negation, as is the identity, but all other type-$0$ elements do not equal their negation. $$a_1 = -a_1$$ $$I_0 = -I_0$$ Swapping the order of operands require that you negate both operands and the expression.  The negation does not ""distribute"" over addition. $$a + b = -(-b + -a)$$ I believe, but am not entirely certain, that $(R, +)$ qualifies as a group. The multiplication operation represents the translation/reflection of one element by/over another: reflection of $a_1$ over $b_1$ $$a_1 \cdot b_1 = c_1$$ $$a_1 \cdot a_1 = a_1$$ translation of $a_1$ by $b_0$ $$a_1 \cdot b_0 = c_1$$ reflection of $a_0$ over $b_1$ $$a_0 \cdot b_1 = -a_0$$ translation of $a_0$ by $b_0$ $$a_0 \cdot b_0 = a_0$$ The identity plays a special role here as well: $$a \cdot I_0 = a$$ $$I_0 \cdot a = I_0$$ Multiplication is a non-associative, non-commutative, yet flexible operation, meaning that the following always holds: $$(a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a)$$ Furthermore, $$(a \cdot b) \cdot -a = (a \cdot b) \cdot a = a \cdot (b \cdot a) = a \cdot (b \cdot -a)$$ My somewhat bizarre addition operation was constructed to give multiplication of property of ""folding over"" addition from the left.

For instance, if $G = \mathbb Z$, then the only $f \in \text{Hom}(G,G)$ to have a non-trivial fixed point is the identity. The set of fixed point $\{y \in G \mid f(y)=y\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. Let $G = \mathbb Z / n\mathbb Z$. Assume that $n=ab$ with $a,b>1$. If $f([1]_n) = [a+1]_n$, then $f$ has a non trivial fixed point, namely $x=[b]_n$.

I don't see a natural way to turn this problem into a « group action » problem (to get some results about fixed points). I tried $G \curvearrowright \text{Im}(f)$ by defining $g \bullet f(x) := f(g)f(x) = f(gx)$, but this doesn't seem to help... Thank you in advance !","I was wondering if there are some ""algebraic"" fixed point theorems, in group theory. More precisely, given a group $G$ and a group morphism $f : G \to G$, what conditions on $G$ and $f$ should we demand, so that $f$ has a non-trivial fixed point (i.e. $\exists x \neq 1_G, f(x)=x$) ? Here are my thoughts : This « non-trivial fixed point condition » is sometimes a strong condition. For instance, if $G = \mathbb Z$, then the only $f \in \text{Hom}(G,G)$ to have a non-trivial fixed point is the identity. The set of fixed point $\{y \in G \mid f(y)=y\}$ is a subgroup of $G$. Let $G = \mathbb Z / n\mathbb Z$. Assume that $n=ab$ with $a,b>1$. If $f([1]_n) = [a+1]_n$, then $f$ has a non trivial fixed point, namely $x=[b]_n$.

99,Galois group of the quintic polynomial $X^5+X+1$,Galois group of the quintic polynomial,X^5+X+1,"I'm trying to find the Galois group of the polynomial $p(X)= X^5+X+1$ over $\mathbb Q$. First, one notes that, if $\omega$ is a primitive cubic root of unity, then it is a root of $p(X)$. So, $X^2+X+1$ is a factor of $p(X)$. We have the following factorisation: \begin{equation} p(X) = (X^2+X+1)(X^3-X^2+1). \end{equation} Now, the derivative of $p(X)$ is $p'(X) = X^4+1$, which is always positive. Hence, $p(X)$ has only one real root, which is a root $\alpha$ of $X^3-X^2+1$. Let me denote by $\eta$ and $\overline{\eta}$ the other two complex roots of $X^3-X^2+1$. Then, a splitting field of $p(X)$ over $\mathbb Q$ is clearly given by \begin{equation} K = \mathbb Q(\alpha, \omega, \eta). \end{equation} Next, I have to compute the degree $[K : \mathbb Q]$ of the extension. It is simple to prove that $[\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta) : \mathbb Q] = 6$: in fact, $\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta)$ is a splitting field of $X^3-X^2+1$ over $\mathbb Q$, and this polynomial has only one real root. So, I try to compute as follows: \begin{equation} [K : \mathbb Q] = [K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)][\mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta) : \mathbb Q]. \end{equation} Here comes my problem: clearly, the degree $[K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)]$ is $1$ or $2$. The point is to understand whether $\omega \in \mathbb Q(\alpha, \eta)$ or not, and I'm unable to give an answer. I think that actually $[K : \mathbb Q(\alpha,\eta)] = 2$, and that eventually one can prove that the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(K | \mathbb Q)$ is isomorphic to $S_3 \times C_2$.
