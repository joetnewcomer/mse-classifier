I want to prove that $F$ itself is representable by a closed $k$-subscheme $Z\hookrightarrow G$ via descent theory and approximation results, and I'm not sure I'm going about it the right way. Since $Z_{k_s}$ is of finite presentation over $k_s$, results on inductive limits show that there is a finite separable extension $k^\prime$ and a closed subscheme $Z_{k^\prime}\hookrightarrow G_{k^\prime}$ that becomes isomorphic to $Z_{k_s}$ upon base change to $k_s$.

2,Sum of Homogeneous Ideals vs Homogeneous Ideal of Intersection,Sum of Homogeneous Ideals vs Homogeneous Ideal of Intersection,,"Sorry for the recent question spam, but I've been striving furiously over the last few days to solve a problem in Hartshorne ( Algebraic Geometry ) discussed in this question . The problem (II.8.4a) says: Let $Y$ be a closed subscheme of codimension $r$ in $\mathbb{P}^n_k$ ($k$ algebraically closed). Then the homogeneous ideal of $Y$ is generated by $r$ elements in $S=k[x_0,...,x_n]$ if and only if $Y$ is equal to the scheme-theoretic intersection of $r$-many hypersurfaces (locally principal closed subschemes), i.e., $\mathcal{I}_Y=\mathcal{I}_{H_1}+\cdots+\mathcal{I}_{H_r}$ where these are ideal sheaves. Hartshorne gives the hint to use the unmixedness theorem for $S$. The direction $\implies$ is easy. I'm trying to prove the other (where we assume $Y$ is a scheme theoretic intersection of hypersurfaces). In exploring this problem, I think I've twigged to how it's ""supposed"" to be solved, but it relies on something not obvious to me, but perhaps obvious to the sources I'm appealing to. The something is this: Let $I_{H_1},...,I_{H_r}$ denote the homogeneous ideals of the hypersurfaces, $I_Y$ the saturated homogeneous ideal of their scheme theoretic intersection. Then the primary components of $\sum{I_{H_j}}$ corresponding to minimal primes, and the primary components of $I_Y$ corresponding to minimal primes coincide. In other words, these ideals only differ in their embedded components. (Matt E seems to use something like the above in answering my question here ). Once this is established, the result follows easily from the unmixedness theorem, but again I'm not sure why this should be obvious. These ideals clearly have the same minimal primes, since they cut out the same irreducible subsets of $\mathbb{P}^n$, but as for why the minimal primary components should agree, I'm at a loss.

21,Morphism of algebraic varieties with vanishing differential,Morphism of algebraic varieties with vanishing differential,,"In differential geometry, we know that given a smooth map between smooth manifolds $\phi:X\to Y$, such that $X$ is connected and $d\phi|_x\equiv0$ for all $x\in X$, then $\phi$ is constant (this follows directly from the fact that a real function on a connected domain whose derivative is identically zero is constant). Now, we can ask whether the same is true about algebraic varieties . i.e where $X,Y$ algebraic varieties over some algebraically closed field $k$ and $\phi$ a morphism of algebraic varieties (with the differential interpreted suitably). Well, the general answer is NO with the canonical counterexample being the Frobenius morphism $x\mapsto x^p$ for $\mathbb{A}^1\to \mathbb{A}^1$ when $\mbox{char}(k)=p$ (it's not constant, but it has zero differential). It seems though that in zero characteristic this problem can't happen, but I would like to see a proof of that (elementary as possible, even computational) or a counterexample. My best try: Using standard arguments this can be reduced to the case where $X$ is irreducible affine and $Y=\mathbb{A}^1$. Embedding $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$ and translating to algebra we get the following formulation: Let $R=k[x_1,...,x_n]$ , $f\in R$ and $P=(g_1,...,g_r)$ a prime ideal in $R$. Suppose that for all $a\in k^n$ such that $g_1(a)=...=g_r(a)=0$ we have $df|_a\in \mbox{Span}(dg_1|_a,...,dg_r|_a)$, then there is $c\in k$ such that $f-c\in P$. It is known (though still not trivial) that if we had $df|_a\equiv0$ for all $a$ in the mutual zero set of $g_1,...,g_r$, which is equivalent to saying that all the partial derivatives of $f$ are in $P$, then we would have the desired conclusion. Perhaps there is a way to reduce the problem to this case. Remark: This is a fairly natural question in my opinion and I was surprised that I couldn't find any reference to it in my algebraic geometry books or just by googling it.","In differential geometry, we know that given a smooth map between smooth manifolds $\phi:X\to Y$, such that $X$ is connected and $d\phi|_x\equiv0$ for all $x\in X$, then $\phi$ is constant (this follows directly from the fact that a real function on a connected domain whose derivative is identically zero is constant). Now, we can ask whether the same is true about algebraic varieties . i.e where $X,Y$ algebraic varieties over some algebraically closed field $k$ and $\phi$ a morphism of algebraic varieties (with the differential interpreted suitably). Well, the general answer is NO with the canonical counterexample being the Frobenius morphism $x\mapsto x^p$ for $\mathbb{A}^1\to \mathbb{A}^1$ when $\mbox{char}(k)=p$ (it's not constant, but it has zero differential). It seems though that in zero characteristic this problem can't happen, but I would like to see a proof of that (elementary as possible, even computational) or a counterexample. My best try: Using standard arguments this can be reduced to the case where $X$ is irreducible affine and $Y=\mathbb{A}^1$. Embedding $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n$ and translating to algebra we get the following formulation: Let $R=k[x_1,...,x_n]$ , $f\in R$ and $P=(g_1,...,g_r)$ a prime ideal in $R$. Suppose that for all $a\in k^n$ such that $g_1(a)=...=g_r(a)=0$ we have $df|_a\in \mbox{Span}(dg_1|_a,...,dg_r|_a)$, then there is $c\in k$ such that $f-c\in P$. It is known (though still not trivial) that if we had $df|_a\equiv0$ for all $a$ in the mutual zero set of $g_1,...,g_r$, which is equivalent to saying that all the partial derivatives of $f$ are in $P$, then we would have the desired conclusion.

In Proposition 19.5.2, a cover with two affine open sets is given : $\operatorname{Spec}(k[x, y] / (y^2 - f(x)))$ and $\operatorname{Spec}(k[u, v]/(v^2 - g(u)))$ , where $g$ is $f$ with coefficients reversed, neither $g$ nor $f$ have any repeated roots, and $0$ is not a root of either $f$ nor $g$ . The transition function on the overlap is : $(k[x, y] /(y^2 - f(x)))_x \rightarrow (k[u, v] /(v^2 - g(u)))_u$ by $x \rightarrow 1/u, y \rightarrow v / u^{r/2}$ . The task is to find $h^1(C, \Omega_{C/k})$ , and that $x^{-1}dx$ is a generator. From Serre duality we know this is 1 dimensional. I'm stuck on the generator part. My approach is below.

Here's a recap of Hartshorne's definition: Let us define algebraic equivalence of divisors. We first do it for an effective divisor (i.e. a divisor that actually correspond to an ideal sheaf $\mathscr I$ ). Then it corresponds to some subscheme $C$ of $X$ . A family of effective divisors is an effective divisor $D$ on $X \times T$ , together with a flat map $\pi: X \times T \to T$ , where $T$ is some smooth curve. If $0,1 \in T$ are two points, we say that $D_0$ (setting $t=0$ ) and $D_1$ are prealgebraically equivalent . Arbitrary divisors can be written as differences between effective divisors, and we say that these are prealgebraically equivalent if they can be written as differences between prealgebraically equivalent divisors. Two divisors $D, D'$ are algebraically equivalent if there is sequence $D=D_0D_1, \ldots, D_{n-1}D_n=D'$ with $D_i$ and $D_{i+1}$ prealgebraically equivalent. So to do the exercise, I have to show that if $D \equiv 0$ and $E \equiv 0$ , then $D+E \equiv 0$ . Since $D=D'-D'' \equiv 0$ (with $D'$ and $D''$ effective), we have a family $\pi: X \times T \to T$ as above, and similarly for $E$ , possibly with a different $T$ . Here comes the problem.

How is this related to the fiber of the tangent sheaf at 0, or to the fiber of the (co)normal cone at 0? We have an exact sequence $0\to N_{Z/X}^{*}\to j^* \Omega^1_X \to \Omega^1_Z\to 0$ . Away form the origin, it is easy to understand what's going on, at a point of the form say $(a,0)$ the stalk of the cotangent sheaf is given by $f(x)dx$ , the fiber is simply $f(a)dx$ , the conormal sheaf has fiber $k.dy$ (where k is the base field or the residue field of the point). At the origin it becomes blurry to me, the normal bundle should have a line as a fiber, but which line? The stalk of the tangent sheaf at the point consists of forms of the form $f(x)dx+g(y)dy$ and the fiber is a vector space of dimension 2. Which is also the case for the fiber of $j^{*}\Omega^1_X$ , but as the sheafs are not (locally) free I cannot deduce that the fiber of the normal bundle is zero, which is good as it should be a line. Most importantly, how does this relate to the tangent cone, which is $xy=0$ . What is the normal cone? In particular how do i deduce the normal cone from the tangent cone (and not the (co)tangent sheaf and the exact sequence). I was hoping that the normal cone should be related (orthgonal) to something like the vector space generated by the tangent cone, but obviously this is not the case. I hope my question is somewhat clear, I can clarify it if needed. Addendum: Algebraically I seem to understand what's going on, it is indeed easy to write down an explicit version of the exact sequence mentionnenned but it is absolutely not clear to me how to interpret the arrow $ N_{Z/X}^* \to\Omega^1_X$ , in particular if I understand things correctly, over $(0,0)$ the map on the fiber will fail to be injective (but will be on the stalks of course), as $\Omega^1_Z$ is not free over $\mathcal{O}_{Z,(0,0)}$ this is not problematic but it makes the geometric interpretention of the (co)normal bundle fiber at that point extremely tedious (to me at least). In particular its fiber is not a subthing of $j_{(0,0)}^*\Omega^1_X$ . Is there a way to have a geometric interpretation of that normal line at the origin.

Show that $\text{Spec }A^G$ is $X/G$ , with $\pi: X\to X/G$ given by the natural inclusion. That is, we need to show $\text{Spec }A^G$ satisfies the universal property of the quotient, where $A^G$ is the fixed ring of automorphisms, and the universal property is that (A) $\pi\circ g=\pi$ for all $g\in G$ , and (B) If $Y$ is any scheme and $\phi :X\to Y$ a morphism of schemes such that $\phi\circ g=\phi$ for all $g\in G$ , then it factors through $\text{Spec }A^G$ . Now, if $Y$ is affine, I think the problem is easy. Since the (antiequivalent) fact is true at the level of rings, then it must be true at the level of affine schemes. That is, if $\psi:B\to A$ satisfies $g\psi(b)=\psi(b)$ for all $g$ , then there's a well-defined map $\theta:B \to A^G$ with $\theta(b)=\psi(b)$ that clearly commutes with the inclusion. However, I'm stuck for when $Y$ is non-affine. The question hints that you should use Prime avoidance, and I think this is used in showing that the fibres consist of the orbits, but I don't know exactly what I am supposed to show. I added this later, and I'd welcome any corrections, or plainly telling me if I am wrong: First let us investigate the fibres of the map $\pi$ . The inclusion $A^G\hookrightarrow A$ is integral, since every element of $z\in A$ satisfies an equation of the form $\prod_{g\in G}(x-gz)$ . Hence, each fiber is non-empty by the Lying Over Theorem. Now if we have two primes in the same fibre, that is $P\cap A^G=Q\cap A^G$ , then $P\subseteq \bigcup_{g\in G}gQ$ since if $p\in P$ , then $\prod_{g\in G} gu \in P\cap A^G=Q\cap A^G$ , so some factor $gu$ must be in $Q$ . By prime avoidance, $P\subseteq gQ$ for some $g$ , and again by integrality (or even by symmetry) we can conclude $P=gQ$ . Suppose $\phi:\text{Spec } A\to Y$ is a morphism of schemes satisfying $G$ -invariance as above. I think the most logical way is to define a map $\bar{\phi}:\text{Spec }A^G\to Y$ set theoretically as $\bar\phi(P)=\phi(P)$ . Then to show it is continuous, it would be enough to prove that $\pi$ is a closed map, since $\bar\phi^{-1}(C)$ for some closed set $C\subseteq Y$ is precisely ${\pi(\phi^{-1}(C))}$ . For this, it would be enough to show that, if $\phi^{-1}(C)=V(a)$ for some ideal $a\subseteq A$ , then $V(a\cap A^G)\subseteq\pi(V(a))$ , (since we have the equality $V(a\cap A^G)=\overline{\pi(V(a))}$ ). But this is true by the Lying Over theorem argument. Therefore $\bar\phi$ is continuous. Finally, notice that for $f\in A^G$ , we have that the localization $(A^G)_f=(A_f)^G$ , therefore $\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A^G}=\pi_*(\mathcal O_{\text{Spec }A})^G$ .

Since $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ is reduced, this shows in particular that (ii): $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ is an integral domain if and only if $x$ lies in only one irreducible component.

93,Is this a valid way to think about sheafification?,Is this a valid way to think about sheafification?,,"This all feels like it should be valid, but I just wanted to get more experienced eyes on it in case I've made a mistake. Take a presheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on a topological space $X$. In order to be a sheaf, for any set of compatible functions $f_i \in \mathscr{F}(U_i)$, there needs to exist a unique gluing. So the sheafification $\mathscr{F}^+$ of $\mathscr{F}$ can be constructed by doing the ""least amount of work"" to make this happen. Intuitively, I feel like this should mean two things happen: First, suppose more than one gluing exist. If $f$ and $g$ are both gluings of $\{f_i\}$, we have no natural way to decide on which to keep. The easiest thing to do is to equate all gluings, and require that $f=g$ in $\mathscr{F}^+$. Second, if a gluing for $\{f_i\}$ does not exist, one is freely adjoined. This new section will not be equal to any old sections in $\mathscr{F}$. We can identify this new section with the collection $\{f_i\}$, perhaps even calling it by the name $[f_i]$. Doing this, we need to have the understanding that it's very likely another compatible family $\{g_j\}$ will exist which glues together to form the same section. If this is the case, we require $[f_i]=[g_j]$. But since no section existed previously, you need a rule to tell when two such compatible families of functions should glue to the same section. In general, they will be defined on different covers, and you need to take a common refinement $\{V_i\}$ of these covers. By pushing each $f_i$ and each $g_j$ through the restriction maps into the appropriate open sets in this refinement, you can compare them directly for equality. And if all the right $f_i$'s and $g_j$'s are equal, then $[f_i] = [g_j]$.","This all feels like it should be valid, but I just wanted to get more experienced eyes on it in case I've made a mistake.
