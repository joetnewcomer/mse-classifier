When I take the Laplace transform, and after some simple algebraic manipulation I obtain $$(s-\epsilon)\mathcal{V}(s)\leq\frac{A^2}{\epsilon s^3}+\frac{2AE}{\epsilon s^2}+\frac{E^2}{2\epsilon s}+V(0).$$ Now, the question is about how to properly dived both sides by $(s-\epsilon )$ since this, as far as I can tell, is sign indefinite. Now, if I assume that that there is no sign change when I do this operation, followed by partial fraction decomposition and then taking the inverse Laplace transform, I obtain $$V(\tau)\leq \left(\frac{A^{2}}{\epsilon^{4}}+\frac{E^{2}}{2\epsilon^{2}}+V(0)+\frac{2AE}{\epsilon^{3}}\right)\text{e}^{\epsilon\tau}-\left(\frac{A^{2}}{\epsilon^{3}}+\frac{2AE}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)\tau-\frac{E^{2}}{4\epsilon^{2}}\tau^{2}-\frac{E^{2}}{2\epsilon^{2}}-\frac{A^{2}}{\epsilon^{4}}-\frac{2AE}{\epsilon^{3}}.$$ This seems fine on initial inspection, since $V(\tau)=V(0)$ when $\tau=0$ , however, things get odd when you change the value of $\epsilon$ . For example, let $A=0.1$ , $E=0.2$ , $V(0)=0$ , then when $\epsilon =0.1$ the value of $V(\tau)<0$ for $\tau\in(1,9)$ (rough bounds). This is a problem since $V$ is a positive definite function (time derivative is positive definite and initial condition here is zero). There is clearly an issue here, and my suspicion is in what I am doing while I am working in the Laplace domain. Now, I see that I can divide equation two by $(s-\epsilon)$ and take it in piecwise form such that $$\mathcal{V}_{u}(s)\leq\begin{cases} \frac{1}{s-\epsilon}\left(\frac{A^{2}}{\epsilon}\frac{1}{s^{3}}+\frac{2AE}{\epsilon}\frac{1}{s^{2}}+\frac{E^{2}}{\epsilon2}\frac{1}{s}+V_{u}(t_{0})\right), & s-\epsilon\geq0\\ -\frac{1}{s-\epsilon}\left(\frac{A^{2}}{\epsilon}\frac{1}{s^{3}}+\frac{2AE}{\epsilon}\frac{1}{s^{2}}+\frac{E^{2}}{\epsilon2}\frac{1}{s}+V_{u}(t_{0})\right), & s-\epsilon<0 \end{cases},$$ but how would one take the inverse Laplace transform of this while taking the conditions of the piecewise function into account? Would I do the following $$\mathcal{L}^{-1}\{s-\epsilon\}$$ and start to look at the time derivatives of the Dirac-delta function?

I never did something along the lines so I'm not quite sure how to do this. $\dot{y}$ looks like a combination of the other two.

Solution: The homogeneous equation $t^2 y^{\prime \prime}-2 t y^{\prime}+2 y=0$ is an Euler equation. The indicial equation is $\lambda(\lambda-1)-2 \lambda+2=0$ , with roots $\lambda=1, \lambda=2$ .

I'll outline my working below: On $[0,\tau]$ we have $$y′(t)−ay(t)=0$$ which gives us $$y(t)=y_0e^{at}$$ if we use an integrating factor of $e^{−at}$ . For $[\tau,2\tau]$ : $$y′(t)−ay(t)=−ay_0e^{a(t-\tau)}$$ which gives me $$y(t) = y_0e^{at}[1-ae^{-a\tau}(t-\tau)]$$ Then, for $t \in [2\tau, 3\tau]$ , I can just continue using the method of steps, but I get a super long expression that does not,,, particularly seem like it would be very generalizable, so I'm not sure if I can get a closed form solution or not (also why I think I might be making a mistake).

(Edit: Adding it here anyway) For : Could someone please confirm if I got the first bits that I've written up there correct though? I'd appreciate it a lot, as I do tend to make many many basic errors sometimes.

Then I generalized this to pretty much the exact thing user DinosaurEgg wrote below except I realized it after looking at the answers fully once I was done lol.

Here it begins: Question: Assuming that before a given time t0 the current is null and the membrane potential is at rest, derive the general solution to Eq. (1) for arbitrary I(t). My Solution: Variation of Parameters method is used to solve differential equation: $$\tau\frac{du}{dt} = \ - (u(t) - u_{\text{rest}}) + RI(t)\quad \tag1 $$ $$\tau\frac{du}{dt} +u(t) =0 \implies \tau\frac{du}{dt}=-u(t)\implies \int \frac{du}{u}=-\int\frac{dt}{\tau}$$ $$u(t)= e^{-t/{\tau}}\cdot C \implies u(t)=C(t)\cdot e^{-t/{\tau}}$$ $$ u^{'}(t)=C^{'}(t)\cdot {e^{-t/{\tau}}-\frac{1}{\tau}e^{-t/\tau}}\cdot C(t) $$ Inserting into  Eq. $(1)$ : $$ \tau\left(C^{'}(t)\cdot {e^{-t/{\tau}} - \frac{1}{\tau}e^{-t/\tau}}\cdot C(t)\right)= -C(t)e^{-t/\tau} +u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t) $$ $$ \tau\cdot C^{'}(t)\cdot e^{-t/{\tau}} =u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t) $$ $$ \int C^{'}(t)=\int \frac{1}{\tau} \left(u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t)\right)\cdot e^{t/{\tau}}dt \implies C(t)= C_{1}+ \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t (u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t))e^{t/{\tau}}dt $$ $$ u(t)= e^{-t/{\tau}}\left(C_{1} +\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t (u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t))e^{t/{\tau}}dt \right) $$ In solution, it says before a given time $t_{0}$ the current is zero and the $ut_{0} = u_{\text{rest}}$ . With this information I can't apply it to find $C_{1}$ . In some resources, they say applying initial condition results that integration part of equation equals to zero. So I tried that: $$ u(t)= e^{-t/{\tau}}\left(C_{1} +\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t (u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t))e^{t/{\tau}}dt \right) $$ Initial condition $ut_{0} = u_{0}$ $$u_{0} =e^{-t0/{\tau}}(C_{1} + \text{ (they specified integration equals to zero)) } \implies C_{1}=u_{0}\cdot e^{t0/{\tau}}   $$ $$u(t)=e^{(t0-t)/{\tau}}\cdot u_{0} + \frac{e^{-t/{\tau}}}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t(u_{\text{rest}}+RI(t))e^{s/{\tau}}ds $$ I couldn't proceed from that point. Book's Solution: $$\tau\frac{du}{dt} +u(t) =0 \iff \frac{du/dt}{u}=-\frac{1}{\tau} \implies u(t)=ke^{-t/{\tau}} $$ A particular solution can be obtained by the ""variation of parameters"" method: we write $u(t)=k(t)e^{-t/{\tau}}$ and replace it in Eq.

Denoting the initial condition by $u_{0} = u_{to}$ , we obtain: $$u(t) = u_{\text{rest}} + (u_{0}-u_{\text{rest}})\cdot e^{-(t-t0)/{\tau}} +\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t RI(s)e^{-(t-s)/{\tau}}ds $$ Using the particular initial condition $u(t_{0}) = u_{\text{rest}}$ , the equation simplifies to: $$ \bbox[yellow]{ u(t) = u_{\text{rest}} + \frac{1}{\tau}\int_{t_{0}}^t RI(s)e^{-(t-s)/{\tau}}ds \implies \text{The real solution}}  $$ As you can realize, my solution is wrong.

I have the feeling that there does not exist a nonzero solution, because of this maximum principle. So how do I know that there does exist a nonzero solution and how can I find this solution. I think I need to assume that there exist a solution $u(x,y) = X(x) \cdot Y(y)$ . Then $0 = \Delta u = u_{xx} + u_{yy} = Y(y) \cdot X''(x) + X(x) \cdot Y''(y)$ . So $X''(x) + aX(x) = 0$ and $Y''(y) + b \cdot Y(y) = 0$ for some constants $a = a(y)$ and $b = b(x)$ . And then solve these ODEs for $X(x)$ and $Y(y)$ . So $u(x,y) = X(x) \cdot Y(y) = (c_{1} \cdot \cos(\sqrt{a}x) + c_{2} \cdot \sin(\sqrt{a} x)) \cdot (d_{1} \cdot \cos(\sqrt{b}y) + d_{2} \cdot \sin(\sqrt{b} y))$ And we know that $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$ . So that means that $u(x,0) = 0$ and $u(x,\pi) = 0$ . And with these boundary values, I only find that $d_{1} = 0$ . So how to continue then?

97,Under what circumstances is $\ddot{x}=\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}$,Under what circumstances is,\ddot{x}=\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx},"I was told a trick by my professors for certain integrals. Given that the path of a particle in 1D is $x(t)$ , then the following is true $$ \ddot{x}=\frac{d\dot{x}}{dt}=\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx} $$ My impression is that this is true for any path, so long as $x$ only depends on $t$ . The reason I ask is for a specific problem in Thornton and Marion. I think the answers I am finding online might be wrong. Specifically this is 2-1; suppose a force is acting on a single particle. If the force has the form $F=F(x_i,t)=f(x_i)g(t)$ , determine if the equation of motion is integrable. The standard answer I am finding copied and pasted is: $$ m\ddot{x}_i=f(x_i)g(t)\\ \text{Since it is the case that } \ddot{x}_i = \frac{d\dot{x}}{dt} \text{, then we have}\\ m\frac{d\dot{x}}{f(x_i)}=g(t)dt $$ Which is then just declared not integrable without further clarification. Suppose that the substitution for $\ddot{x}$ I mentioned is generally true for functions of one variable.Then we can rewrite the EOM as $$ m\ddot{x}_i=f(x_i)g(t)\\ m\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}_i}{dx_i}=f(x_i)g(t)\\ \text{Which can be rewritten as } m\dot{x}d\dot{x}=f(x_i)g(t)dx_i $$ To which I would argue that as long as $g(t)$ is not dependent on $x_i$ , then the above should be perfectly integrable. Specifically: $$ \frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2=g(t)\int f(x_i)dx_i\\ \text{which can be modified to give }\\ \sqrt{\frac{m}{2}}\dot{x}=\sqrt{g(t)}\sqrt{\int f(x_i)dx_i}\\ \text{which just simply gives } \frac{dx_i}{\sqrt{\int f(x_i)dx_i}}=\sqrt{\frac{2g(t)}{m}}dt $$ Which would appear to still be integrable.

Suppose that the substitution for I mentioned is generally true for functions of one variable.Then we can rewrite the EOM as To which I would argue that as long as is not dependent on , then the above should be perfectly integrable. Specifically: Which would appear to still be integrable. So have people been copying the wrong solution for years, or am I wrong for some reason I do not see?","x(t)

Here it is $$-y'^2y^2+ay^4+by=-c$$ Where y is a function of time and a,b and c are constants. So in order to find an easier differential equation that I could solve I did the following, we know that $$1=\frac{dt}{dt}=\frac{dt}{dy}\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{dt}{dy}y'$$ Let's thus rewrite the ODE as, $$-y'^2y^2+ay^4+by=-c\frac{dt}{dy}y'$$ Since I know that $y'$ is never 0, I divide by $y'$ on both sides, $$(-y'y^2+\frac{a}{y'}y^4+\frac{b}{y'}y)dy=-c\times dt$$ So if we integrate both sides with respect to the correct variable we get, $$\int(-y'y^2+\frac{a}{y'}y^4+\frac{b}{y'}y)dy=\int-c\times dt$$ $$-\frac{y'}{3}y^3+\frac{a}{5y'}y^5+\frac{b}{2y'}y^2=-c\times t+p$$ Where p is an integration constant.
