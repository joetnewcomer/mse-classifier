1,Equivalence of quadratic forms over p-adic fields.,Equivalence of quadratic forms over p-adic fields.,,"There is a theorem that states that two quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are equivalent iff they have the same rank, discriminant and the same $\epsilon$ invariant. (The last is defined as follows: if $f = \sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i^2$ then $\epsilon(f) = \prod_{1\le i < j \le n} (a_i,a_j)$, where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the Hilbert symbol over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.) The proof (from Serre's Arithmetic) is based on a previous theorem, which relates these invariants to the elements the forms represent. However, I do not know how I can show that two particular forms are equivalent (with the same invariants of course). So fix some prime $p$ and consider the following two forms over $\mathbb{Q}_p$: \begin{equation} f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 - (x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2) \nonumber  \end{equation} and \begin{equation} g(x) = -(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2) \nonumber  \end{equation} How can I show in particular that these two are equivalent (without using the classification theorem above)?

2,Can it be proven (or disproven) that a particular digit is more prevalent than another digit in the set of all natural numbers?,Can it be proven (or disproven) that a particular digit is more prevalent than another digit in the set of all natural numbers?,,"This ties back to a SO question, where someone wanted to increase performance of an algorithm, and part of the solution was ""test the most likely situation first"". The question involved checking for the presence of one or more of a particular subset of base-10 digits, and so the answer involved first testing that each digit wasn't in the subset, because that was more likely. This got me thinking. In the infinite set of all natural base-10 numbers, is any single digit more prevalent than any other? And a corollary: is the answer to that question different for a different number base (such as binary, octal, or hexadecimal)? The common-sense answer to both questions would be ""no"". However, a simple exercise in binary numbers would demonstrate that the digit 1 is more common than the digit 0 in the significand of a fixed set of binary digits: 0 1 10 11 //maximum value of 2 bits; there have been 4 1s and 2 0s. 100 101 110 111 //maximum value of 3 bits; 12 1s and 6 0s have occurred. 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 //maximum value of four bits; 32 1s and 18 0s have occurred. I know enough about math to know the common-sense answer is often wrong; for instance, trans-infinite numbers defining differing cardinalities of ""infinite"" sets. There are also pseudo-rules that look like a sure thing until the problem space becomes large; you can already see just through four bits that, while 1 is more common than 0, 0 is occurring more often as the number of bits in the significand increases. So, I thought I'd ask and see if anyone else could prove or disprove it in the general case.","This ties back to a SO question, where someone wanted to increase performance of an algorithm, and part of the solution was ""test the most likely situation first"".

By Eisenstein's criterion, $x^{n} - p$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ and so $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{p}):\mathbb{Q}] = n$ . However, I wonder if it is trivial that $x^{m} - q$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[n]{p})$ , assuming the general form of Eisenstein's criterion over integral domain (see Wikipedia for the statement).

However, the assumption fails in general, and when we enlarge $\mathbb{Q}_q$ to its finite extension that contains $\sqrt[n]{p}$ , the situation gets worse.

The statement is that if you have a finite extension $K$ of the $p$ -adic rationals $\mathbb{Q}_p$ , and $\pi$ is a uniformizer of $\mathcal{O}_K$ , then $$[\mathcal{O}_K/\pi\mathcal{O}_K : \mathbb{Z}_p/p\mathbb{Z}_p] = v_p(\vert N(\pi)\vert)$$ In the non- $p$ -adic case, where $K'$ is some extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ and where $\pi \vert p$ , showing that $[\mathcal{O}_{K'}/\pi\mathcal{O}_{K'}:\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}] = v_p(\vert N(\pi)\vert)$ is more straightforward to me: Since $\mathcal{O}_{K'}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$ -module, I can imagine it as $\mathbb{Z}^n$ , and then the quotient by $\pi$ is like a lattice, with $\pi$ as matrix giving a basis of that lattice, and the volume of the fundamental parallelepiped is the determinant of that matrix, which is $N(\pi)$ . The number of integer points in the fundamental parallelepiped will be equal to its volume, showing that $\vert \mathcal{O}_{K'}/\pi\mathcal{O}_{K'}\vert = \vert N(\pi)\vert$ . Since $\vert\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\vert =p$ , that gives the result. But this doesn't seem to extend to the $p$ -adic case. $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ doesn't look like a lattice to me, and even if it were, I'm not sure how to relate the volume to the number of points in it. Maybe I could argue that $\mathbb{Z}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ , and that $\mathbb{Z}_p/p\mathbb{Z}_p$ can take representatives of each coset from $\mathbb{Z}$ , so I can treat $\mathcal{O}_K/\pi\mathcal{O}_K$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$ -module.

92,An elegant non-technical account on the work of Joseph Fourier.,An elegant non-technical account on the work of Joseph Fourier.,,"It would seem difficult for a naive person to understand the beauty of work done by Fourier. So as far as I know, one can use the Fourier transforms, analysis and series to apply them for heat equations, and its very evident that present world's seminal mathematician J.Tate has also used the Fourier analysis in his celebrated thesis. So I was looking for some most elegant explanation about the beauty of Fourier analysis giving an intuition into the subject, and for the sake of brevity, assume that the targeted naive reader has some basic mathematical knowledge, ( not so naive !! ). I think the most difficult job is to explain things naively. But there are many people who can explain it mathematically taking a function and applying it and showing the effect, but its the most tough job to do it other way, as remarked by Prof.Einstein, "" If you can't explain simply, you don't understand it well-enough "" . I would be very happy if someone maps the theory to the nature and explain the theory in terms of things going on around us, like trees, leaves etc..( not necessarily trees and leaves, but in any way ) and how could one apply them to the nature practically.
