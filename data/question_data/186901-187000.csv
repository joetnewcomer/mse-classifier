Thus Theorem 3 might be written $$ (f+g)' = f' + g' $$ For which he follows up with: Strictly speaking, these equations may be false, because the functions on the left- hand side might have a larger domain than those on the right. I feel like I am missing the main message here, and do not quite understand what he means by thinking about the theorems (mainly, the rules for differentiation) in terms of values instead of functions. Does he mean that such an 'expansion' only makes sense if a specific value is attached to a function? e.g. $(f(a) + g(a))' = f'(a) + g'(a)$ as illustrated earlier in the chapter.

That means if from $0$ to $2$ , $g(x)$ is positive, from $2$ to $3$ , $g(x)$ should be negative.

80,Can anyone help me understand the notation of binary operator in the definition,Can anyone help me understand the notation of binary operator in the definition,,"The definition goes, Let $S$ be a non-empty set. Then a function $f : S \times S \to S$ is   a binary operator.

And if I say that $f$ is the same binary operator as well, then $f= \text{*}$. So I can write $f(a,b)= afb$ which seems to be absurd because $b$ is not the image of $a$ under $f$.

Consider the binary operation : $a*b= 2a +b, \forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Suppose that $\mathbb{Z}$ has an identity $e$ w.r.t. $*$. Then, $e*1 = 2e + 1  = 1 \implies  2e = 0 \implies   e=0$. But, $1*0 = 2 + 0 = 2 \ne 1$, so $0$ cannot be an identity.","I have example in which there is only option of contradiction to prove that identity does not exist.
