This looks to me like a complete definition of cardinal numbers.  (I will call it Definition 1.)  But immediately after the paragraph above, Jech writes: The relation (3.1) is an equivalence relation.  We assume that we can assign to each set $X$ its cardinal number $|X|$ so that two sets are assigned the same cardinal number just in case they satisfy condition (3.1).  Cardinal numbers can be defined either using the Axiom of Regularity (via equivalence classes of (3.1)), or using the Axiom of Choice. In this chapter we define cardinal numbers of well-orderable sets; as it follows from the Axiom of Choice that every set can be well-ordered, this defines cardinals in ZFC. I don't know what to make of the sentence in bold.  Does it mean that the real definition of cardinals is still coming, and therefore that Definition 1 does not count somehow?
