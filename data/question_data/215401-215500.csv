In order to do this I first rotate my x-y axis so that x runs from the centre of one object through the center of the other object (both are circles). (the image in the link nicely illustrates the situation) In the link I provide, calculation of resulting vx and vy vectors for each object after the collision is explained. It uses the following equations to rotate the vx and vy components(I'm sorry I don't know how to insert proper equations) vxr = v * cos(theta - phi) vyr = v * sin(theta - phi) with vxr being the rotated vx vector (same for vy), theta being my original angle between v and the x axis, phi being my rotation angle Then these ""rotated"" vx and vy components are inserted into the equations for conservation of momentum and kinetic energy to solve a 1D collision (which is possible because of the rotation of the axis). Afterwards he rotates the axis back using the following equations: vfx = vfxr * cos(phi) + vyr * cos(phi + pi/2) vfy = vfyr * sin(phi) + vyr * sin(phi + pi/2) with vfxr/vfyr being the resulting rotated x/y component after collision, vfx vfy being the resulting x/y components transformed back into the regular x-y plane.

What about the equation to rotate vx and vy back to the regular x-y plane? Secondly, if my assumptions are correct, I am unable to perform the calculations when inserting these equations into the 1D collision equations.
