0,Maximum amount of iterations to get to an empty list from repeatedly taking the smallest complement of a list,Maximum amount of iterations to get to an empty list from repeatedly taking the smallest complement of a list,,"I was trying to solve Iterative Smallest Complement on the Code Golf website, and thought of an interesting question. A basic run down of what the smallest complement of a list is: ... B is a complement of A if: B has all of the integers between the minimum and maximum of A which are missing from A , and B has none of the integers present in A So basically, you make the list $[\min(A)\ldots\max(A)]\backslash A$ , where $\backslash$ represents set difference. Now given a list of non-repeating numbers $A$ , repeatedly find the smallest complement until you obtain the empty set, and record how many iterations it took. Iterations include the initial list $A$ and the empty set: $\{\}$ . For example, given $A=[1,3,4,5,8]$ , the iterations are as follows: $[1,3,4,5,8]$ $[2,6,7]$ $[3,4,5]$ $[]$ So, $4$ iterations when $A=[1,3,4,5,8]$ . Now I was wondering: For any given list $L$ which includes no repeating numbers, what is the highest amount of iterations possible? I'm looking for some kind of expression in terms of $L$ (like its length, or maximum value, etc.). I'm also wondering if there is some kind of algorithm which can generate a list with the most amount of iterations.","I was trying to solve Iterative Smallest Complement on the Code Golf website, and thought of an interesting question.

Now I have a few difficulties to gain an entry to this question. The textbook and the lecture videos which I'm using gives no explanation about composition of relations.

Define the functions $\Gamma,\Delta:X^{n+1}\to X^{n+1}$ by $$\Gamma(f)=\bigg(\Phi[f|_{\{1,\dots,n\}}],f(n+1)\bigg)$$ $$\Delta(f)=f\circ \pi$$ where $\pi:\{1,\dots,n+1\}\to \{1,\dots,n+1\}$ is the permutation defined by $$\pi(i)=\begin{cases}        i & \text{if } \quad i<i_0 \\       n+1 & \text{if } \quad i=i_0 \\      i-1 & \text{if } \quad i>i_0     \end{cases}$$ where $i_0$ is the smallest element of the set $\big\{1\leq i\leq n:f(n+1)\leq f(i)\big\}$ if this set is nonempty, and $i_0:=n+1$ otherwise.

9,Unpacking a proof that filter convergence characterizes continuous maps,Unpacking a proof that filter convergence characterizes continuous maps,,"Statement: Let $f : (X, \tau) \to (Y, \sigma)$ be a mapping between topological spaces. Then $f$ is continuous iff, whenever $\Phi$ is a filterbase on $X$ converging to a limit $p \in X$ , then the filterbase $f(\Phi)$ converges to $f(p) \in (Y, \sigma)$ . Proof: (i) Suppose $f$ is continuous. Let the filterbase $\Phi$ converge to $p$ (that is, each neighbourhood of $p$ contains some $F \in \Phi$ ). If $N$ is a neighbourhood of $f(p) \in Y$ then $f^{–1}(N)$ is $_1$ a neighbourhood of $p \in X$ so $f^{–1}(N)$ contains some $F \in \Phi$ , that is, $f(F) \subseteq_2 N$ ; therefore $f(\Phi)$ converges $_3$ to $f(p)$ . (ii) Suppose $f$ is not continuous. Then $\exists$ closed $K \subseteq Y$ such that $f ^{–1}(K)$ is not closed in $X$ , so $\exists \ p \in \overline{f^{–1}(K)}$ such that $p \not \in_4 f^{–1}(K)$ . Then $\Phi = \{N \cap f^{–1}(K) : N \in \text{set of neighborhoods of $p$}\}$ is $_5$ a filterbase that converges $_6$ to $p$ . Yet $f(\Phi)$ does not $_7$ converge to $f(p)$ , since $Y \setminus K$ is a neighbourhood of $f(p)$ containing no $f(F)$ for $F \in \Phi$ . My questions (each index in the proof above corresponds to the number of a question below): Suppose $N$ is a neighborhood of $f(p).$ Then by definition of neighborhood,  there some open $G \in \sigma$ s.t. $f(p) \in G \subseteq N$ . Then $p \in f^{-1}(G).$ But $G \subseteq N \implies f^{-1}(G) \subseteq f^{-1}(N)$ . By definition, $f^{-1}(N)$ is a neighborhood of $p$ . Is that correct? (a) Suppose $y \in f(F).$ Then there is $p \in X$ s.t. $f(p) = y.$ And so there's some $F \subseteq X$ s.t. $p \in F$ . By assumption, each neighbourhood of $p$ contains some $F \in \Phi$ and since $f^{-1}(N)$ is a neighborhood of $p$ , we have $F \subseteq f^{-1}(N)$ meaning $p \in f^{-1}(N)$ implying $f(p) = y \in N.$ Is that correct? (b) Why can't we simply say $f(p) \in f(F) \implies f(p) \in N$ as $N$ is a neighborhood of $f(p)$ ? That's true because $\Lambda = \{N \subseteq Y: \exists f(F) \in f(\Phi), \ f(F) \subseteq N\}$ is a filter on $Y$ and $f(\Phi)$ is a base for $\Lambda.$ Since $\Lambda \to f(p)$ , we have $f(\Phi) \to f(p)$ by definition.

Since $x=x$ is a tautology, then we infer $\forall x \in U$ . This definition tells us that every free variable in the scope of the universal quantifier is an element of $U$ . Since $x \in U$ means $\{x\} \subseteq U$ , then $\forall x \in U$ could be rewritten as $\forall x[\{x\} \subseteq U ]$ or $\forall X[X \subseteq U]$ . Therefore, every set $X$ is a subset of the universal set $U$ . However, I've seen in some proofs and commentaries cases which define the universal set as a finite collection of objects, for example $U = \{ x_0, x_1\}$ . This formula is equivalent to $\forall x[x \in U \leftrightarrow x \in \{x_0, x_1\}]$ and to $\forall x[x \in U \leftrightarrow x = x_0 \lor x=x_1\}]$ .

Suppose that $\mathcal{W}$ is some property of subsets of $\mathbb{R}.$ A subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is $\text{co-}\mathcal{W},$ if $\mathbb{R}-X$ has property $\mathcal{W}.$ Let $\{X_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a collection of $\text{co-}\mathcal{W}$ subsets of $\mathbb{R},$ where $I$ is some indexing set.

My attempt: Let’s first see what kind of subsets have the property $\mathcal{W}.$ It is required that these subsets are finite. It can’t be any interval of $\mathbb{R},$ if it was, then it would be infinite. If we have a set of $n$ real numbers, that set would be finite.

For example, if $X = (-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty),$ then $\mathbb{R}-X=\{0\}.$ So $X$ is $\text{co-}\mathcal{W}.$ Note that $X$ is infinite.

21,Alternative proof of isomorphism between linearly ordered sets,Alternative proof of isomorphism between linearly ordered sets,,"The following theorem theorem is proved in Hrbacek and Jech's Introduction to Set Theory: Theorem: Let $(A, \prec)$ be a nonempty linearly ordered set with the properties: (a) For every $p \in A$ , there is $q \in A$ such that $q \succ p$ . (b) Every nonempty subset of a has a least element (in the order $\prec$ ). (c) Every nonempty subset of $A$ that has an upper bound    has a greatest element (in the order $\prec$ ). Then $(A, \prec)$ is isomorphic to $(\mathbb{N}, <)$ . We need to show there is a biyection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $A$ that preserves order. My questions ( below ), specifically, are about the part where they prove their function is surjective. So i'm gonna sketch the first part of the proof and then will reproduce verbatim the argument I am referring to: Sketch of proof: A sequence $f: \mathbb{N} \to A$ is constructed recusrively as follows: (i) $f_0 = a =$ the least element of $A$ (it exists by (b)) (ii) $f_{n+1} =$ the least element of $A$ greater than $f_n$ . (it exists by (a) and (b)) Clearly $f_n \prec f_{n+1}$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Then $f_m \prec f_n$ whenever $m < n$ (by induction) and $f$ is one to one. We now prove the range of $f$ is $A$ . Their argument is this: If not, $A - \operatorname{ran}{f} \neq \emptyset$ ; let $p$ be the least element of $A - \operatorname{ran}{f}$ . The set $B = \{q \in A: q \prec p \}$ has an upper bound $p$ , and is nonempty (otherwise, $p$ would be the least element of $A$ , but then $p = f_0$ ). Let $q$ be the greatest element of $B$ (it exists by (c)). Since $q \prec p$ , we have $q = f_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$ . However, it is now easily seen that $p$ is the least element of $A$ greater than $q$ . Therefore, $p = f_{m+1}$ by the recursive condition (ii). Consequently, $p \in \operatorname{ran}{f}$ , a contradiction. Question 1: is the boldfaced line the only part where they use the fact $p$ is the least element of $A - \operatorname{ran}{f}$ ? It seems to me it is. Question 2: Is the following alternative ""proof"" of this fact correct? Proof: Take $p \in A$ (notice I do not assume $p$ is a least element) and define $B = \{f_n \in A: f_n \prec p\}$ . If $p = a = f_0$ then we are done, so suppose $a = f_0 \prec p$ ; hence $B \neq \emptyset$ since $f_0 \in B$ . Also, $B$ has $p$ as an upper bound so it has a greatest element $f_n$ . If $f_{n+1} \prec p$ , then $f_{n+1} \in B$ and $f_n \prec f_{n+1}$ , which is impossible since $f_n$ is the greatest element of $B$ . If $p \prec f_{n+1}$ , then $f_n \prec p \prec f_{n+1}$ and $f_{n+1}$ is not the least element of $A$ greater than $f_n$ . We conclude then that $f_{n+1} = p$ (we are using the fact $\prec$ is a linear order here) and $p \in \operatorname{ran}{f}$ .","The following theorem theorem is proved in Hrbacek and Jech's Introduction to Set Theory: Theorem: Let be a nonempty linearly ordered set with the properties: (a) For every , there is such that .

This much we can conclude from the parts (a) through (c) above. Am I right? Now my question is, how to prove rigorously (i.e. using induction or otherwise) that there are a total of $3^n$ true relations? My Attempt: Our desired assertion of course holds for $n = 1$ . Suppose it holds for an arbitrary positive integer $n$ . Now let us consider the set $U$ given by $$ U \colon= \{ 1, \ldots, n, n+1 \}. $$ Let us form the set $U^\prime$ as $$ U^\prime \colon= \{ 1, \ldots, n \}. $$ Then of course $$ U^\prime \subset U, $$ and also $$ U \setminus U^\prime = \{ n+1 \}. $$ Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary subsets of $U$ . We want to count the total number of tru relations $A \subseteq B$ . The following four cases arise: Case 1. Suppose both $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $U^\prime$ . Then there are a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ , by our inductive hypothesis. Case 2. Suppose that $A \subseteq U^\prime$ and $B \not\subseteq U^\prime$ . Then $n + 1 \in B$ but $n + 1 \not\in A$ . Let us form the set $B^\prime$ as $$ B^\prime \colon= B \setminus \{ n+1 \}. $$ Then both $A$ and $B^\prime$ are subsets of $U^\prime$ , and so by our inductive hypothesis there are a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B^\prime$ , and since $B^\prime \subset B$ , we can conclude that corresponding to each of the $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B^\prime$ , we have the true relation $A \subseteq B$ . Thus there are at least a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . On the other hand, as $n+1 \in B$ but $n+1 \not\in A$ , so if $A \subseteq B$ , then we also have $A \subseteq B^\prime$ , and since there are a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B^\prime$ , we can conclude that there are at most a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . From the preceding two paragraphs we can conclude that there are exactly $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . Case 3. Suppose that $A \not\subseteq U^\prime$ and $B \subseteq U^\prime$ . Then $n + 1 \in A$ but $n+1 \not\in B$ . Thus $A \not\subseteq B$ . There are a total of $0$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . Case 4. Suppose that $A \not\subseteq U^\prime$ and $B \not\subseteq U^\prime$ . Then $n+1 \in A$ and $n+1 \in B$ . Let us form the sets $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$ as follows: $$ A^\prime \colon= A \setminus \{ n+1 \} \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad B^\prime \colon= B \setminus \{ n+1 \}.  $$ Then of course $$ A^\prime \subseteq U^\prime \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad B^\prime \subseteq U^\prime. $$ So by our inductive hypothesis there are a total of $3^n$ true relations of the form $A^\prime \subseteq B^\prime$ . But whenever $A^\prime \subseteq B^\prime$ holds, we also have $$ A^\prime \cup \{ n+1 \} \subseteq B^\prime \cup \{ n+1 \}, $$ that is, $$ A \subseteq B. $$ Thus there are at least $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . On the other hand, suppose that $A \subseteq B$ . Let $x \in A^\prime$ . Then $x \neq n+1$ and as $A^\prime \subset A$ , so we also have $x \in A$ , which from the supposition of $A \subseteq B$ implies that $x \in B$ ; thus $x \in B$ and $x \neq n+1$ , which implies that $x \in B^\prime$ . So it follows that $A^\prime \subseteq B^\prime$ . Therefore whenever $A \subseteq B$ holds, we also have $A^\prime \subseteq B^\prime$ . Thus there are at most $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . Combining the conclusions of the preceding two paragraphs we can conclude that there are exactly $3^n$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ . Since the above four cases are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaust all the possibilities for subsets $A$ and $B$ of our set $U$ , therefore we can conclude that there are a total of $$ 3^n + 3^n + 0 + 3^n = 3 \times 3^n = 3^{n+1} $$ true relations of the form $A \subseteq B$ , where $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary subsets of the set $U$ given by $$ U = \{ 1, \ldots, n, n+1 \}. $$ Thus by the principle of mathematical induction our assertion holds for all positive integers $n$ .

61,Use the well-ordering principle to prove that every integer $n\ge2$ has a prime factor.,Use the well-ordering principle to prove that every integer  has a prime factor.,n\ge2,"EDIT: I am updating this to illustrate my proof thus far. I would appreciate any critique. Question details: ""Use the well ordering principle to prove that every integer $n\ge2$ has a prime factor. One way to prove this for a given integer $n\ge2$ is to apply the well-ordering principle to the set $X=\{d\in{\Bbb Z}:d\ge2 \land d\ |\ n\}$, the set of all factors $d$ of $n$ such that $d\ge2$. (a) Prove that $X$ is not empty. (b) Prove that if $p$ is the minimal element of $X$, then $p$ must be a prime number. (c) Finish the proof of the theorem."" (a)  Trivial. By definition of $X$, $n\in X$ if $n\ge2$. Thus, $X$ is nonempty given any integer $n\ge2$. (b) Suppose $p$ is the minimal element of $X$. Then, it is a divisor of $n$, and it is also $\ge2$. Consider some integer $q\ge2$ that is a divisor of $p$. Then, $q\in X$ by definition of $X$, since any divisor of $p$ is also a divisor of $n$  (and $q\ge2$).  Since $p$ is the minimal element of $X$, then any other element of $X$ $\le p$. Therefore, $q\le p$. Furthermore, $q$ is a divisor of $p$, so $q\ge p$. Then, $q=p$. Thus, $p$ only has two positive integer factors - itself, and 1. Therefore, $p$ is prime. (c) Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a set $C$, of integers $\ge2$ that cannot be factored into a product of two prime numbers. By the well-ordering principle, there is some $m\in C$ such that $m$ is the minimal element of $C$. Because $m\in C$ and therefore cannot be prime, it must be the product of two integers $s,t$ such that $2\le s,t \lt m$. Therefore, $s,t\notin C$ because they are smaller than $m$, which is the minimal element of $C$. Since $s,t\notin C$, they can be factored into the products of primes, $a_1,a_2,b_1$ and $b_2$ such that $s=a_1*a_2$ and $t=b_1*b_2$. Since $s,t$ are divisors of $m$, $m=s*t=(a_1*a_2)(b_1*b_2)$, the product of primes. This is a contradiction, because $m\in C$. Thus, set $C$ cannot exist. As a consequence, we have proved that every integer $n\ge2$ has a prime factor. [The End] Have I got it right? If not, please point out any flaws. If I do have it correct, what I would especially appreciate is any input on the proof-writing itself - is it nonsensical or inefficient? Thanks!","EDIT: I am updating this to illustrate my proof thus far. I would appreciate any critique. Question details: ""Use the well ordering principle to prove that every integer $n\ge2$ has a prime factor. One way to prove this for a given integer $n\ge2$ is to apply the well-ordering principle to the set $X=\{d\in{\Bbb Z}:d\ge2 \land d\ |\ n\}$, the set of all factors $d$ of $n$ such that $d\ge2$. (a) Prove that $X$ is not empty. (b) Prove that if $p$ is the minimal element of $X$, then $p$ must be a prime number. (c) Finish the proof of the theorem."" (a)  Trivial. By definition of $X$, $n\in X$ if $n\ge2$. Thus, $X$ is nonempty given any integer $n\ge2$. (b) Suppose $p$ is the minimal element of $X$. Then, it is a divisor of $n$, and it is also $\ge2$. Consider some integer $q\ge2$ that is a divisor of $p$. Then, $q\in X$ by definition of $X$, since any divisor of $p$ is also a divisor of $n$  (and $q\ge2$).  Since $p$ is the minimal element of $X$, then any other element of $X$ $\le p$. Therefore, $q\le p$. Furthermore, $q$ is a divisor of $p$, so $q\ge p$. Then, $q=p$. Thus, $p$ only has two positive integer factors - itself, and 1. Therefore, $p$ is prime. (c) Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a set $C$, of integers $\ge2$ that cannot be factored into a product of two prime numbers. By the well-ordering principle, there is some $m\in C$ such that $m$ is the minimal element of $C$. Because $m\in C$ and therefore cannot be prime, it must be the product of two integers $s,t$ such that $2\le s,t \lt m$. Therefore, $s,t\notin C$ because they are smaller than $m$, which is the minimal element of $C$. Since $s,t\notin C$, they can be factored into the products of primes, $a_1,a_2,b_1$ and $b_2$ such that $s=a_1*a_2$ and $t=b_1*b_2$. Since $s,t$ are divisors of $m$, $m=s*t=(a_1*a_2)(b_1*b_2)$, the product of primes. This is a contradiction, because $m\in C$. Thus, set $C$ cannot exist. As a consequence, we have proved that every integer $n\ge2$ has a prime factor. [The End] Have I got it right? If not, please point out any flaws.

87,Formalization of an intuitive idea to construct a surjection,Formalization of an intuitive idea to construct a surjection,,"Let $A$ be an arbitrary set and $B$ be any non-empty set. Furthermore, suppose that there is no injection from $A$ to $B$. I want to prove that it follows that there is a surjection from $A$ to $B$. I have an intuitive argument in mind to prove this, but I do not know how to formalize it. Here is this intuitive argument: Since $B$ is non-empty, there has to be a function from $A$ to $B$. Let us fix one such a function $f_0\colon A \to B$. The idea is to modify this function $f_0$ using the fact that there is no injection from $A$ to $B$ to  get a surjective function. If $f_0$ is surjective, then we are done. So the interesting case is the case where there are some elements of $B$ that are not in the image of $f_0$. Our job is to modify $f_0$ in such a way that these elements of $B$ are hit too. Let $b_0$ be an element of $B$ which is not in the image of $f_0$. Since $f_0$ is not injective, there are two distinct elements $a_0, {a_0}'\in A$ such that $f_0(a_0)=f_0({a_0}')$. Now we can define a function $f_1\colon A\to B$ as follows: if $a\not = {a_0}'$ then $f_1(a) := f_0(a)$, and if $a={a_0}'$ then $f_1(a):=b_0$. If $f_1$ is surjective, then we are done. Otherwise we can do the same again: Let $b_1$ be an element of $B$ which is not in the image of $f_1$. Since $f_1$ is not injective, there are two distinct elements $a_1, {a_1}'\in A$ such that $f_1(a_1)=f_1({a_1}')$. Now we can define a function $f_2\colon A\to B$ as follows: if $a\not = {a_1}'$ then $f_2(a) := f_1(a)$, and if $a={a_0}'$ then $f_2(a):=b_1$. We can iterate this process a finite number of times. Thus, if the image of $f_0$ is finite, then $f_n\colon A\to B$ is surjective, where $n$ is the cardinality of the image of $f_0$. Intuitively I think that this argument also works if the image of $f_0$ is countably infinite. Then we can carry out the same process to construct functions $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$ and so on. Then the limit $f_\omega$ of this countably infinite process is a surjective function $A\to B$. Indeed, I also think that this kind of argument always works. We can iterate this process until every element of $B$ is hit, if necessary by constructing functions $f_{\omega + 1}$, $f_{\omega + 2}$, $f_{\omega +3}$, ...,  $f_{\omega\cdot 2}$, ..., $f_{\omega\cdot 3}$, ..., $f_{\omega\cdot\omega}$, ..., $f_{\alpha}$ (where $\alpha$ is an ordinal number).

Any direction would be greatly appreciated.",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing']"
