What I've tried My first approach: $f^{-1}$ is continuous if $f$ maps open sets to open sets.

Let $V \subset [0,1]$ so that $f^{-1}(V)$ is open (since $f$ is continuous) and $f(f^{-1}(V))=V$ which is also open.

Let $A_0=A^*, B_0=B^*, A_1=A-A_0.$ Define: $$B_1=\phi(A_1)\equiv\{y|y=\phi(x),x\in A_1\}$$ $$A_2=\psi(B_1)\equiv\{x|x=\psi(y),y\in B_1\}$$ (1) $\color{red}{\text{Since}\ A_2\subset A_0}$ , we have $A_1\cap A_2=\emptyset$ . (2) Also, let $B_2=\phi(A_2)$ , since $\phi$ is 1-1, $B_1\cap B_2=\emptyset.$ (3) $\color{red}{\text{In general, if we have constructed } A_1, A_2,..., A_n\ \textbf{pairwise disjoint}, B_1,B_2,...,B_n \ \textbf{pairwise disjoint,}} $$A_{i+1}=\psi(B_i),B_i=\phi(A_i),i=1,2,...,n-1,$ let $$A_{n+1}=\psi(B_n),B_{n+1}=\phi(A_{n+1}).$$ (4) Becuase $\psi$ is 1-1, from $B_1,...B_n$ pairwise disjoint, we know that $\color{red}{A_{n+1}\text{ and } A_2,...,A_n\text{ are pairwise disjoint.}}$ (5) Also, since $A_{n+1}\subset A_o$ , $A_{n+1}$ and $A_1$ are pairwise disjoint. (6) Now, since $\phi$ is 1-1, $A_1,...,A_{n+1}$ are pairwise disjoint, $B_{n+1}$ and $B_1,...,B_n$ are pairwise disjoint. (7) We obtain two sequences of pairwise disjoint sets $\{A_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ , $\{B_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$ ， $A_{i+1}=\psi(B_n),B_{n+1}=\phi(A_{n+1}),i=1,2,3...$ . Therefore $\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n\sim^\phi\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n$ . (8) Also, through $\psi$ , $B\sim A_0, B_k\sim A_{k+1}$ , therefore $$B-\bigcup^\infty_{k=1}B_k\sim^\psi A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{k=1}A_k=A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{n=2}A_n.$$ (9) $A_1=A-A_0$ , $A_0\subset A\Rightarrow A_0=A-A_1$ . Therefore $$A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{n=2} A_n= A-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n,$$ therefore \begin{align} A & = (A-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1} A_n)\cup(\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n)\\  & = (A_0-\bigcup^\infty_{n=2} A_n)\cup (\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}A_n)\\   & \sim (B-\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n)\cup(\bigcup^\infty_{n=1}B_n) \\  & = B  \end{align} Starting from (1) and (2). When I first attempted to follow the proof myself, I wrote something: $A_1$ is a subset of $A$ where the one-to-one correspondence does not hold. Therefore, $B_1=\phi(A_1)$ may or may not be in $B_0$ . But then I don't see why $A_2\cap A_1=\emptyset$ . I think I am not quite sure if $\phi$ is the 1-1 function between $A_0$ and $B$ , what exactly is $\phi(A_1)$ . Where will $\phi$ map $A_1$ onto? In my understanding, $A_2\cap A_1=\emptyset$ only if $B_1\subset B_0$ , if so, why? Did I misunderstand some very important concepts or I misunderstand the proof?. Proceed to line (3), if we iterate the process, we could obtain $A_1\cap A_2=\emptyset$ ， $A_2 \cap A_3=\emptyset$ , so on and so force. It is a weaker condition as compared to pairwise disjoint.

55,Parametrized permutation function,Parametrized permutation function,,"I'm looking for a way to construct a function that would work the way depicted in the following picture: That is, I want it to permute the elements in a given array to put them in some different order depending on a parameter I give it, so that the numbers of my choice from the original set (those I marked with grey background) would all end up as a continuous range at the beginning of the output array (to the left of the thick line), while all other elements (red background) would end up at the remaining positions in that array (to the right of the thick line). The order of those elements in each of the output ranges (grey or red) doesn't matter to me. They can be put in any arbitrary order by that function, whatever is simpler to compute for a particular choice of selected input elements (grey). The only thing that matters is that all those selected elements (grey) end up on one side of the boundary, while other elements (red) end up on the other side of that boundary, and the two ranges are continuous. This function needs to be parametrizable so that, out of all possible permutations of this array, I could choose that particular permutation that puts the elements in that particular order by just specifying some numerical parameter (or parameters) in the function's formula. One numerical parameter is preferable, since there is only one permutation that puts all the elements in this particular order, and this number could be the ""identifying number"" of that permutation, but if that would be hard to achieve, several numerical parameters is acceptable, as long as it doesn't exceed the number of chosen elements (which would probably make it not worth the effort anyway). Is there a way to construct a formula for such a function in a systematic way, given a subset of ""chosen elements"" from the input array? Maybe something based on modular arithmetics or finite fields? A quick web search gave me a term called ""permutation polynomials"" that at first glance seems to be related to this problem somehow, but all the resources I could find about them are some thick math that seems to require a lot of background in that field to even understand what's going on (I'm just an IT engineer / programmer looking for a solution for some programming problem, not a professional mathematician :q ) Of course, any function could be put into a lookup table. But that's not what I'm looking for, because that would require a lookup table of the same size as the entire input set, which would be an overkill. Edit: One thing that comes to my mind is modular exponentiation, since in prime moduli, when a primitive root is chosen as the base, and the exponent is our $x$ , then every power of that base is unique (maximal period) and the resulting sequence is some permutation of the original sequence (however, it always starts and ends with 1, and there's always $N-1$ in the middle). But this way I can only obtain some permutations, not every possible permutation. Raising this exponential function to some other power $p$ only selects every $p$ th element from this sequence, so this way I can only get a sequence for another primitive root (provided that $p$ is coprime to the size of the modulus less one, because otherwise the period breaks into shorter cycles, like for some other base that is not a primitive root).

Let $X$ be a set. Then there exists a set $\{Y \, : \, Y \text{ is a subset of } X\}$ . It is denoted $2^X$ . Axiom 3.10. Power set axiom: let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.

Then there exists a set $\bigcup A$ whose elements are those objects which are elements of elements of $A$ , i.e., $x \in \bigcup A$ iff $x \in S$ for some $S \in A$ . A consequence: if one has some set $I$ , and for each element $\alpha \in I$ we have one set $A_\alpha$ , then we can form the union set $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha$ by defining: $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha := \bigcup \{ A_\alpha \, | \, \alpha \in I\}$ . There are some very complete solutions out there, e.g. here . My sketch of proof is much shorter, thus I think that there are many errors in it. Here it is: Let be $X' \subseteq X$ and $Y' \subseteq Y$ . If both $X'$ and $Y'$ are fixed, then per the power set axiom (3.10), there exists a set $Y'^{X'}$ which consists of all the functions from $X'$ to $Y'$ . By lemma 3.4.9, there exist a set $2^X$ which consists of all the subsets of $X$ , and a set $2^Y$ which consists of all the subsets of $Y$ . Now we fix an element $X'$ of $2^X$ . Let be $Y'$ an element of the set $2^Y$ , $f$ a function, and $P$ the property `` $P(Y', f)$ : $f$ is a function from $X'$ to $Y'$ ''. Per the replacement axiom, there exists a set $\{f \, | \, P(Y', f) \text{ is true for some } Y' \in 2^Y\} = \{f \, | \, f: X' \rightarrow Y' \text{ for some } Y' \in 2^Y\}$ . This set is related to a fixed subset $X' \subseteq X$ , so let's denote this set $S_{X'} = \{f \, | \, f: X' \rightarrow Y' \text{ for some } Y' \in 2^Y\}$ . Now we apply the union set (3.11), especially in its second formulation. If we denote $I = 2^X$ , then for each element $X' \in I$ we do have one set $S_{X'}$ , which is defined above. Thus, there exists a set $\bigcup_{X' \in 2^X} S_{X'} := \bigcup \{S_{X'} \, | \, X' \in 2^X\}$ .

Definitions: $|X|=_c|Y|$ means that there is a function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ that is one-to-one and onto $Y$ . When $X$ and $Y$ are finite sets, then $|X|=|Y|$ if and only if $|X|=_c|Y|$ . $X$ has the same cardinality as $Y$ . Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. The set of all functions from $X$ to $Y$ , denoted ${^X}{Y}$ , is defined by ${^X}{Y}$ ={ $F$ : $F$ is a function from $X$ to $Y$ }. Here is what I did: Let $f:A \rightarrow A \times A$ and $g:K \times L \rightarrow K \times L$ be bijections. Let $l:A \rightarrow K \times L$ and define $G:{^A}{(K \times L)} \rightarrow {^A}{K} \times {^A}{L}$ by $G(l)=g \circ l \circ f^{-1}$ , for each $l \in {^A}{(K \times L)}$ . We prove that $G$ is one-to-one. Let $l \in {^A}{(K \times L)}$ and $l^{\ast} \in {^A}{(K \times L)}$ . Assume that $G(l)=G(l^{\ast})$ , thus $(g \circ l \circ f^{-1})(x)=(g \circ l^{\ast} \circ f^{-1})(x)$ for all $x \in A \times A$ . Hence $g((l \circ f^{-1})(x))=g((l^{\ast} \circ f^{-1})(x))$ for all $x \in A \times A$ . Since $g$ is one-to-one, we conclude that $(l \circ f^{-1})(x)=(l^{\ast} \circ f^{-1})(x)$ for all $x \in A \times A$ . We now show that $l(a)=l^{\ast}(a)$ for all $a \in A$ , thus $f(a) \in A \times A$ . Letting $x=f(a)$ , we obtain $l(a)=l^{\ast}(a)$ since $f^{-1}(f(a))=a$ , so $l=l^{\ast}$ and $G$ is hence one-to-one. To prove that $G$ is onto ${^A}{K} \times {^A}{L}$ , let $h \in {^A}{K} \times {^A}{L}$ , then $g^{-1} \circ h \circ f \in {^A}{(K \times L)}$ and $G(g^{-1} \circ h \circ f)=h$ . Therefore, the function $G:{^A}{(K \times L)} \rightarrow {^A}{K} \times {^A}{L}$ is a bijection. I would appreciate if someone could help me with this one as I do not know what I did wrong.

Hence, $$f'(1)=10-\cos(\infty)$$ This is a finite value oscillating between $[9,11]$ but how do I find that? So here I am stuck.. Method 1/2 From the fundamental theorem of calculus $$f'(x)=\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$ Here $a=1$ and substituting $x$ to $1+h$ where $h→0$ we get- $$\lim_{h→0}\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{1+h-1}$$ $$\lim_{h→0}\frac{e^{[(1+h)^{10}-1]}+(1+h-1)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{1}{1+h-1}\bigg)}{h}$$ Now the second part becomes $\frac{h^2\sin(\frac{1}h)}{h}$ which is $\frac{\sin(\frac{1}h)}{\frac{1}h}$ when $h→0$ . Therefore that is clearly $0$ . Coming to the first part we get- $$\frac{e^{\big((1+h)^{10}-1\big)}}{h}$$ Expanding $(1+h)^{10}$ using binomial expansion, we obtain $$(1+h)^{10}= \binom{10}{0}+\binom{10}{1}h+\binom{10}{2}h^2+....$$ From here I cannot take it. The $\binom{10}{0}$ gets cancelled by $1$ , but what will I do with the rest? I did a little further although illegally $:$ P, that since $h→0$ therefore I completely ignored the terms containing $h^2$ or higher powers of $h$ . So we are left with $e^{10h}$ . Expanding this using Taylor expansion (Maclaurin to be precise) we get $$e^{10h}= 1 + 10h+ \frac{(10h)^2}{2!} + \frac{(10h)^3}{3!} +......$$ Since we have an $h$ in the denominator, only $10h$ becomes $10$ and remaining all $0$ except $1$ which becomes $\frac{1}h$ . As you can see, $\frac{1}h$ creates problem here. we remember that we did illegal assumptions, so mathematics always arrests anyway $:$ P Any help in this part? Coming to the second part of the question- Method 2/1 $$\lim_{u→\infty}[100u-u\sum_{k=1}^{100}f\bigg(1+\frac{k}u\bigg)]$$ Let's break this and see it in parts.. second part $$\bigg(1+\frac{k}u-1\bigg)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{1}{1+\frac{k}u-1}\bigg)$$ $$\implies \bigg(\frac{k}u\bigg)^2\sin\bigg(\frac{u}k\bigg)$$ Now when $u→\infty$ this becomes $0$ due to clear reasons stated previously.. So every term of this summation becomes $0$ . first part $$e^{\big((1+\frac{k}u)^{10}-1\big)}$$ When $u→\infty$ this becomes $e^{(1-1)}$ or $e^0$ therefore $1$ . Therefore the summation upto $100$ terms becomes nothing but $100$ . Therefore, our limit becomes $$\lim_{u→\infty}[100u-100u]$$ $$=0$$ Am I correct?

86,Existence and uniqueness proof check/critique,Existence and uniqueness proof check/critique,,"Problem statement, as written: Let $f\colon A \rightarrow C$ and $g\colon A \rightarrow B$ be functions. Prove that there exists a function $h\colon B \rightarrow C$ such that $f = h \circ g$ if and only if $\forall x,y \in A$ , $g(x) = g(y) \rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$ . Prove that $h$ is unique. The theorem is vacuously true if any of $A,B,C$ are empty. Thus, $A,B,C \ne \emptyset$ . As such, let $c_0 \in C$ . Define $h\colon B \rightarrow C$ by $h = \{(b,c)|\exists x \in A$ such that $b = g(x)$ and $c = f(x)\}$ $\cup$ $\{(b,c_0) | b \in \{B -\{g(a) | a \in A\}\}\}$ . To see that $h$ satisfies the definition of function, we show that 1) $dom(h) = B$ , 2) $ran(h) \subseteq C$ , and 3) $(x,y_1),(x,y_2) \in h \rightarrow y_1 = y_2$ . To prove 1), first, let $b \in dom(h)$ . Then by the definition of $h$ , $\exists a \in A$ such that $b=g(a)$ . But $g\colon A \rightarrow B$ ,so $g(a) = b \in B$ . So $dom(h) \subseteq B$ . To prove the converse, let $b\in B$ . Note since $g\colon A \rightarrow B$ , either $\exists a \in A$ such that $b = g(a)$ , or $\forall a\in A, b \ne g(a)$ . Thus, we break the proof into two exhaustive cases. Case 1) $ \exists a\in A$ such that $ b = g(a)$ . Then by the definition of $h$ , $b \in dom(h)$ . So this case results in $B \subseteq dom(h)$ . Case 2) $ \forall a \in A, b \ne g(a)$ . This time, by the definition of $h$ , $(b,c_0) \in h$ , so again, we have that $b\in dim(h)$ . This case also results in $B \subseteq dom(h)$ . Thus, $B = dom(h)$ . To prove 2), let $c \in ran(h)$ . Then by the definition of $h$ , $\exists a \in A$ such that $c = f(a)$ . Since $f\colon A \rightarrow C$ , $f(a) = c \in C$ . Thus, $ran(h) \subseteq C$ . Lastly, to show 3), assume $(x,y_1),(x,y_2) \in h$ . Then by the definition of $h$ , $\exists a\in A$ such that $x = g(a)$ . Furthermore, $y_1 = f(a) = y_2$ . Thus, in particular, $y_1 = y_2$ . In other words, every domain element is mapped to a (unique) range element. Now we prove the biconditional statement form of the theorem. $(\rightarrow)$ Suppose $f=h\circ g$ . Let $x,y \in A$ and assume $g(x) = g(y)$ . Then $(h \circ g)(x) = h(g(x)) = f(x)$ . Since $g(x) = g(y), h(g(x)) = h(g(y)) = f(y)$ (The rightmost equalities in each of the preceding two strings of equalities are a result of applying the definition of $h$ ). Thus, in particular, $f(x) = f(y)$ , as desired. $(\leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\forall x,y \in A, g(x) = g(y) \rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$ . To see that $f = h\circ g$ , take $a \in A$ . $(h \circ g)(a) = h(g(a)) = f(a)$ , where the last equality, again, follows from the definition of $h$ . To see that $h$ is unique, suppose $l$ is any other function such that $f = l \circ g$ if and only if $\forall x,y \in A$ , $g(x) = g(y) \rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$ . To see that $h = l$ , we proceed by contradiction. Thus, suppose (to the contrary) $l \ne h$ . Then $\exists \beta \in B$ such that $h(\beta) \ne l(\beta)$ . Since $g$ is surjective, by hypothesis, $\exists a_1 \in A$ such that $\beta = g(a_1)$ ; also, $h(\beta) = f(a_1) = c_1$ . Suppose $x,y \in A$ and $g(x) = g(y)$ . Then by the definition of $h$ applied to $g(x)$ , we find that $f(x) = f(y)$ . Thus we may conclude that $f = h \circ g$ and $f = l \circ g$ , so $h\circ g = l\circ g$ . Observe that $(a_1,c_1)\in f = h\circ g$ , so $(a_1,c_1)\in h\circ g$ . This means $\exists b_1 \in B$ such that $(a_1,b_1)\in g$ and $(b_1,c_1) \in h$ . Recall, however, that $h\circ g = l\circ g$ also. Hence, $(a_1,c_1) \in l \circ g$ . So $\exists b_* \in B$ such that $(a_1,b_*) \in g$ and $(b_*,c_1) \in l$ . But since $g\colon A\rightarrow B, b_* = b_1$ . Thus, as $\beta = g(a_1) = b_* = b_1$ , $l(\beta) = c_1 = h(\beta)$ , a contradiction. Therefore, it must be that $l = h$ .","Problem statement, as written: Let and be functions. Prove that there exists a function such that if and only if , . Prove that is unique.
