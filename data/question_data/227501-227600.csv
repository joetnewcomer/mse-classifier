For example, in the case that $S$ is a polynomial ring the constant terms, $S_0$ would now become terms of degree $n$. I have seen a heuristic explanation of $\mathcal{O}_x(n)$ as allowing functions on $X$ which have poles of degree $n$. As in the case when $S$ is a polynomial ring. We define the usual structure sheaf on $\mathcal{O}_x = S^{\sim}$ For each $U \subset X$, we define $S^{\sim}$ to be the set of of functions  $$ s: U \to \bigsqcup_{\frak{p} \in U} S_{(p)} $$ where $S_{(p)}$ is the set of elements of degree zero in the localized ring $T^{-1}(S)$ where $T$ is the multplicative subset of all homogeneous elements of $S$ which are not contained in $\frak{p}$. The function $s$ have the following conditions: $s(p) \in S_{(p)}$ For each $\frak{p} \in U$, there exists an open subset $V \subset U$, and homogeneous elements $a,f$ in $S$ of the same degree, such that for all $\frak{q}$ $\in V$, $s(q) = \frac{a}{f}$ where $f \notin \frak{q}$. In other words, the function do not blow up locally for any $\frak{p} \in U$. So now I want to see what $\mathcal{O}_x(n) = S(n)^{\sim}$ allows our functions $s$ to have poles of degree $n$. In the original description of the structure sheaf it seems that poles were locally avoided by requiring that $f \notin \frak{q}$ for all $\frak{q}$ in near $\frak{p}$. First of all, let us look at $S(n)_{(p)}$. In $S_{(p)}$ our elements where fractions, $\frac{s}{a}$, of homogeneous elements of the same degree. Are the elements of $S(n)_{(p)}$ fractions of homogeneous elements which differ by $n$-degrees? Furthermore condition $(2)$ above avoids poles by demanding that the denominator of our fractions are not contained in any prime ideal.

1,Intuition behind intersection multiplicity for plane algebraic curves,Intuition behind intersection multiplicity for plane algebraic curves,,"I am trying to understand what the intuition behind the intersection multiplicity of two plane algebraic curves is/should be. I know that there are different ways to define this value, but the book I am working with right now uses the following: Let $g,f \in k[x,y]$ s.t. $f$ and $g$ have no factor in common. Assume that $f(0,0)=g(0,0)=0$. Denote the associated curves with $F,G$. The intersection multiplicity of $F,G$ at $P=(0,0)$ is the number: $$ I(P,F\cap G):=\dim_k B  $$ where $B=(k[x,y]/(f,g))/(x,y)^n$ and $n$ is the  number s.t. $(x,y)^N=(x,y)^{N+1}$ for all $N\geq n$. Such a number exists because we know that $k[x,y]/(f,g)$ is a finite dimensional vector space. So far so good. I know what all of this means and I can work with it i.e. I can compute the dimension for examples. My question is: What is the intuition behind this definition? Or in other words: How does one come up with this definition? Here are my thougths so far: Let's assume $k=\mathbb{C}$ from here on. We can write the Taylor expansion for $f$ and $g$ at $P=(0,0)$ using multi indices . \begin{eqnarray} f(x,y) &=& f(0,0) + \sum_{\vert\alpha \vert\geq 1}\dfrac{D^\alpha f(0,0)}{\alpha!}x^\alpha\\ g(x,y) &=& g(0,0) + \sum_{\vert\alpha \vert\geq 1}\dfrac{D^\alpha g(0,0)}{\alpha!}x^\alpha \end{eqnarray} My intuition now tells me that $I(P,F\cap G)$ should agree with $\vert \alpha \vert$ s.t. $$f(x,y)-g(x,y)=\sum_{\vert \alpha \vert=I(P,F\cap G)}\dfrac{D^\alpha f(0,0)-D^\alpha g(0,0)}{\alpha!}x^\alpha+\text{higher order terms},$$ where of course the $\sum_{\vert \alpha \vert=I(P,F\cap G)}\frac{D^\alpha f(0,0)-D^\alpha g(0,0)}{\alpha!}x^\alpha \neq 0$. The intuition is coming from the geometric picture that the multiplicity at $P$ should somehow measure how ""tangent"" the two curves are to each other. I computed some examples and for those it is indeed true but I have a hard time proving it in full generality. And maybe it's wrong all together. I would appreciate if somebody could give me a proof or point to one or in general can give me more insight to my question above.","I am trying to understand what the intuition behind the intersection multiplicity of two plane algebraic curves is/should be.

Restricting to $\mathcal{X}$, we end up with the equation     $$X\left[(X^2-2+s^2X^2)(X-s^2X) + ts\right] = 0$$ If we look in the other affine path where $a_1\neq 0$ with coordinates $[r,1]$ we get a similar equation     $$Z\left[(r^2Z^2 - 2 + Z^2)(r^2Z - Z) + t\right] = 0$$ These two affine equations should glue to give an arithmetic surface having generic fiber $C$ and special fiber a conic meeting two lines, each at two points. But the special fiber when $a_0\neq 0$ has equation      $$X^2(X^2-2+s^2X^2)(1 - s^2) = 0,$$ and when $a_1\neq 0$, the equation is      $$Z^2(Z^2 - 2 + r^2Z^2)(r^2 - 1) = 0.$$ I guess the conic is given affine locally by the equation $Z^2-2 + r^2Z^2$ and the two lines are given by $1-s$ and $1+s$?

Consider the action of the group $G=k^*$ given by $(x,y)\mapsto (\alpha x,\alpha^{-1}y)$ for any $\alpha\in k^*$. Prove that $X/G$ (which a priori is just a ringed space) is in fact a scheme. What if $X=\mathbb{A}^2$? I think that the first quotient is $\mathbb{P}^1$, but I'm not sure how to show it for real. My intuitive reasoning is as follows: let's assume that $k$ is algebraically closed. Then the equivalence classes of closed points are the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and all the equilateral hyperbolas $xy=c$ ($c\neq 0$). So if I take say the line $y=1$ this intersects exactly once all the classes apart from one (namely, the $x$-axis). The quotient of $X$ minus the $x$-axis is then (or, at least, seems like) $\mathbb{A}^1$, and then the whole quotient is $\mathbb{P}^1=\mathbb{A}^1\cup\{[\text{$x$-axis}]\}$. Also, if I compute the ring of fixed polynomials of $X$ minus the $x$-axis I get $k[xy]\cong k[t]$ (the problem with this is that I get the same with $X$ minus the $y$-axis, so it doesn't seem to give a $k$ as global sections, as I would expect).

Could you please show me how to really prove this (that is: to give a proof in the language of schemes that considers all points equal, and that adapts to the second case).","Let $X=\mathbb{A}^2\setminus\{(x,y)\}$ be the affine scheme minus the origin (say over a field $k$). Consider the action of the group $G=k^*$ given by $(x,y)\mapsto (\alpha x,\alpha^{-1}y)$ for any $\alpha\in k^*$. Prove that $X/G$ (which a priori is just a ringed space) is in fact a scheme. What if $X=\mathbb{A}^2$? I think that the first quotient is $\mathbb{P}^1$, but I'm not sure how to show it for real. My intuitive reasoning is as follows: let's assume that $k$ is algebraically closed. Then the equivalence classes of closed points are the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and all the equilateral hyperbolas $xy=c$ ($c\neq 0$). So if I take say the line $y=1$ this intersects exactly once all the classes apart from one (namely, the $x$-axis). The quotient of $X$ minus the $x$-axis is then (or, at least, seems like) $\mathbb{A}^1$, and then the whole quotient is $\mathbb{P}^1=\mathbb{A}^1\cup\{[\text{$x$-axis}]\}$.

Note that since $M$ is finitely generated, $$V(M)=\{\mathfrak{m}\in \text{max-Spec} R: \mathfrak{m}\supseteq \text{ann}_R M\}\cup \{R_+\}.$$ Now let $$\text{Supp}_R^+M:=\{\mathfrak{p}\in \text{Proj}R: M_{\mathfrak{p}}\neq 0\},$$then the authors say  this set determines and is determined by $V(M)$. I was wondering how this correspondence works. Thanks in advance. Edit: One thing to note is that Supp$_R^+M=V^+(M)$ where $$V^+(M):=\{\mathfrak{p}\in \text{Proj} R: \mathfrak{p}\supseteq \text{ann}_R M\}$$ since $M$ is finitely generated. Also, ann$_RM$ is a homogeneous ideal, since $M$ is a graded $R$-module.

There are some fairly nice singularities that can occur in $X/G$. For example, suppose we have a transversal $A_1$ singularity, where it is known that blowing up the quotient gives a single fixed $\mathbb{P}^1$ bundle resolving the singularity. Moreover, this resolution is crepant. Instead of blowing up $X/G$, one can instead look at this fixed curve on $X$ in local coordinates, say $\mathbb{C}^3$ where the $x$-axis is the transversal $A_1$ singularity, and the action is (locally) given by $(0,-1,-1)$. One can blowup this $\mathbb{C}^3$, note that the exceptional divisor is fixed by the induced action and so there is now a fixed divisor. Hence, the quotient of this blowup by $G$ is smooth. Similarly we can do this for a transversal $A_2$, $A_3$, etc... as well as an isolated fixed point with (local) action given by $(\zeta_3,\zeta_3,\zeta_3)$ where $\zeta_3$ is a primitive third root of unity. This corresponds to a cone over a triple Veronese surface. When $X/G$ admits a crepant resolution, for example when $G\subset \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ by Bridgeland-King-Ried, is it always possible to blowup smooth local charts to get fixed divisors, so that after sufficiently many blowups the quotient is smooth, giving a crepant resolution? I am interested in more complicated actions, where the singular quotient is not such an easy thing to work with, whereas blowing up smooth $\mathbb{C}^3$ (or eventually $\mathbb{C}^n$) is quite doable! However, I have been trying and cannot seem to always get this to work. For a small example, let $G = \langle \zeta_6\times \zeta_3\times \zeta_2\rangle$ act on $\mathbb{C}^3$, where $\zeta_n$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. The $y$-axis is a transversal $A_1$ singularity, while the $z$-axis is a transversal $A_2$ singularity, and these can be blown up to fixed divisors, but the point of intersection at the origin is fixed by the whole group, and every approach I take to blowing up the smooth $\mathbb{C}^3$ never gives me a fixed divisor corresponding to this point. My concern is that when dealing with the quotient $X/G$ you can do small resolutions, which do not show up on a smooth variety, and perhaps there is no way to get the same effect without taking the quotient first. For example, if we take the example above and blowup the $y$ and $z$ axes, we get $$ \{ (x,y,z),[u:v] \mid xv = yzu \} $$ with a smooth affine $\{(y,z,\frac{u}{v}\}$ and a nodal chart $\{(x,y,z,\frac{v}{u} | x\frac{v}{u} = yz\}$. A small resolution of the node is given by blowing up $(x,z)$, say $$ \{ (x,y,z,\frac{v}{u}),[a:b] \mid xb = za,\ x\frac{v}{u} = yz \}. $$ This has (smooth) affine charts $\{(z,\frac{v}{u},\frac{a}{b})\}$ and $\{(x,y,\frac{b}{a})\}$.

Namely, I want to show that $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$ is a fine moduli space of lines through the origin in $\mathbb{C}^2$. Edit: I want to phrase the question differently and more detailed. Here are my thoughts. First of all, by $\mathbb{C}^2$ I mean the affine space $\textrm{Spec} (\mathbb{C}[x,y])$. And a line through the origin is a subscheme corresponding to an ideal generated by $\lambda x+\mu y$ where $\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{C}$ are not both zero. Now consider the functor $F$ from the category of schemes over $\mathbb{C}$ to the category of sets that sends a scheme $X$ to the set of subschemes $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}^2 \times X$ (together with the projection on $X$) that have the property that the fiber over every $\mathbb{C}$-point of $X$ is a line through the origin (the fiber is embedded to $\mathbb{C}^2$ via the projection). I want to show that $F$ is isomorphic to $\textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})$. So I want to find two natural transformations $F\to \textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})$ and $\textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})\to F$ that are inverse to each other. For the second one there is a natural candidate coming from the tautological bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. But my problem is to show that this has an inverse: So I have a subscheme $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}^2 \times X$ that has the property that the fiber over every $\mathbb{C}$-point of $X$ is a line through the origin and I have to find a corresponding morphism $X \to \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. This means that I have to associate a line bundle to $W$ that is generated by two global sections. I guess to do that, one takes sections of the projection map $W \to X$. This gives a sheaf on $X$, but why is it coherent and locally free of rank one?","I am struggling with Exercise 1.5 from the book ""Moduli of Curves"" by Harris and Morrison.

Here are my thoughts. First of all, by $\mathbb{C}^2$ I mean the affine space $\textrm{Spec} (\mathbb{C}[x,y])$. And a line through the origin is a subscheme corresponding to an ideal generated by $\lambda x+\mu y$ where $\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{C}$ are not both zero. Now consider the functor $F$ from the category of schemes over $\mathbb{C}$ to the category of sets that sends a scheme $X$ to the set of subschemes $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}^2 \times X$ (together with the projection on $X$) that have the property that the fiber over every $\mathbb{C}$-point of $X$ is a line through the origin (the fiber is embedded to $\mathbb{C}^2$ via the projection). I want to show that $F$ is isomorphic to $\textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})$. So I want to find two natural transformations $F\to \textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})$ and $\textrm{Mor}_{\mathbb{C}}(-,\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})\to F$ that are inverse to each other. For the second one there is a natural candidate coming from the tautological bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. But my problem is to show that this has an inverse: So I have a subscheme $W \subseteq \mathbb{C}^2 \times X$ that has the property that the fiber over every $\mathbb{C}$-point of $X$ is a line through the origin and I have to find a corresponding morphism $X \to \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$. This means that I have to associate a line bundle to $W$ that is generated by two global sections. I guess to do that, one takes sections of the projection map $W \to X$. This gives a sheaf on $X$, but why is it coherent and locally free of rank one?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'deformation-theory']"

Is there anything I have maybe overlooked in this proof or didn't do rigorously?  If it is correct, I'd like to leave the proof as a reference for myself and others. For $k$ algebraically closed, let $R = k[X_1, ... ,X_n]$, and suppose the ideal $\mathfrak a$ in $R$ can be generated by $r$ elements.  Show that every irreducible component of $Z(\mathfrak a)$ has dimension $\geq n-r$. Let $\mathfrak a = (f_1, ... , f_r)$.  A maximal irreducible closed set contained in $Z(\mathfrak a)$ corresponds to a minimal prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ containing $\mathfrak a$, so we need to show that if $\mathfrak p$ is a minimal prime containing $\mathfrak a$, then the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is $\geq n - r$.  If any of the $f_i$ are units, then $Z(\mathfrak a) = \emptyset$, so we can assume this is not the case.  I think this can be done by induction on $r$. If $r = 1$, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is exactly $n-1$ (by the Hauptidealsatz).  Now assume $r > 1$.  Let $\mathfrak a_0 = (f_1, ... , f_{r-1})$.  We have two cases: either $f_r \in \mathfrak a_0$ (that is, $\overline{f_r} = 0$ in $R/\mathfrak a_0$) or else not.  Suppose it is.  Then $\mathfrak a = (f_1, ... , f_{r-1})$, and by induction, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p$ is $\geq n - (r-1) > n -r$. Suppose $f_r \not\in \mathfrak a_0$.  Then in the ring $R/\mathfrak a_0$, the ideal $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is a minimal prime ideal containing $\overline{f_r}$ (easy to check that $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is not the whole ring).  Then the height of $\mathfrak p/\mathfrak a_0$ is $1$ by the Hauptidealsatz.  So there must be another prime $\mathfrak p_0$ such that $\mathfrak a_0 \subseteq \mathfrak p_0 \subsetneq \mathfrak p$, with no primes between $\mathfrak p_0$ and $\mathfrak p$, and no primes between $\mathfrak a_0$ and $\mathfrak p_0$.  Now $\mathfrak p_0$ is a minimal prime containing $\mathfrak a_0$, which has $r-1$ generators, so by induction, the dimension of $R/\mathfrak p_0$ is $\geq n - (r-1)$.

For instance, $\omega_X$ is ample, $h^0(\omega_X)=p_a(X)$ and has degree $2p_a(X)-2$, $p_a$ being the arithmetic genus.
