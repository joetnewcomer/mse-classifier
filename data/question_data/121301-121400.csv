20,Is this a valid proof of the derivatives of the trigonometric functions?,Is this a valid proof of the derivatives of the trigonometric functions?,,"For the sake of this proof, the trigonometric functions $\cos$ and $\sin$ are defined as the coordinates of a point on the unit circle, rather than any of the modern analytic definitions. Let $\vec x(\theta)$ be a function giving the position of a point on the unit circle as a function of the angle $\theta$, that is, $\vec x(\theta) = \left( \begin{array}{c} \cos(\theta)\\ \sin(\theta)\\ \end{array} \right)$. Decompose $\vec x'(\theta)$ into a colinear and an orthogonal component with $\vec x(\theta)$. If the colinear component is non-null, then on the assumption that $\vec x'(\theta)$ is continuous ( could this be demonstrated? ), it would be non-null over some small interval ( right? ), and then by taking the integral over that interval, we would have that $\vec x(\theta)$ either moves away from or towards the center of the origin, which is contrary to our hypotheses. Thus the colinear component is always null, and $\vec x'(\theta)$ is always tangent to the circle. But for any vector $\left( \begin{array}{c} a\\ b\\ \end{array} \right)$, a vector is orthogonal to it if and only if it is colinear with $\left( \begin{array}{c} -b\\ a\\ \end{array} \right)$.

They state that the transformation that quantifies the perpendicular displacement of a point from this line with be given by: $d = x \sin \theta - y \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the slope angle of the line. I understand this to mean that the given equation should tell me the perpendicular distance from the point to the line. I have two problems: I can't see how this works, and it gives me different answers to other formulae that I do understand. The diagram below shows a point (A) and two lines, $y = x$ and $y = x + 6$. Obviously the distance from the point (the dotted line) should be longer for $y = x + 6$ than it should be for $y = x$, but the formula given in the paper gives the same result for both. Of course this is the case, as the formula takes into account three of the four variables involved (gradient of the line and x and y locations of the point, but not the y-intercept of the line).

56,Can $n$ squares each be dissected into identical polygons and then re-assembled into a a single larger square,Can  squares each be dissected into identical polygons and then re-assembled into a a single larger square,n,"Suppose you have $n$ unit squares. Can you dissect each square into polygons such that all the polygons are identical , and then re-arrange the polygons into a single big square of area $n$ ? Rotations, reflections, translations are allowed, but there can be no gaps or overlaps. All of the polygons across each of the $n$ squares must be identical. So for example, if $n$ is a square $n=r^2$ , the polygons can simply be the squares themselves which you can arrange in an $r\times r$ grid. For a slightly non-trivial example, for $n=2$ , you can cut the two squares along a diagonal to get 4 isosceles right triangles each of area $1/2$ , and then arrange these into a square of area $2$ by having each edge of the square be a hypotenuse of one of the triangles. Below I generalize this to integers $n$ that can be written as the sum of two squares. Using the Sum of two squares theorem we can characterize such $n$ . But what about other $n$ ? In particular, is there a solution for $n=3$ ? Or are there some $n$ for which it is impossible to perform such an operation? Solution for $n=a^2+b^2$ : Suppose $a,b$ are both non-zero; otherwise $n$ itself is a square in which case we are already done. We can then consider the right triangle of sides $a,b,\sqrt{n}$ where $\sqrt{n}$ is the length of the hypotenuse; call the edges of this triangle $A,B,C$ , respectively. If we had $4$ copies of this triangle, we can arrange them inside a square of area $n$ (called the ""big square"") by putting the $C$ edge of each copy as one of the edges of the square. The result is that there will be a square hole of side-length $|b-a|$ in the middle of the big square (rotated relative to the big square of area $n$ ). Since the inside square had integer side lengths, it can be made of $(b-a)^2$ of our unit squares. So for this inside square, it doesn't matter how we divide the unit squares, since for $(b-a)^2$ of the unit squares we can just re-assemble them back into the original unit squares and then build our inside square of side-length $|b-a|$ . So it remains to divide up the unit squares into identical polygons such that we can build our triangle of side-length $a,b,\sqrt{n}$ . This triangle be built from $(ab)^2$ triangles of side-length $\frac{1}{b},\frac{1}{a},\frac{\sqrt{n}}{ab}$ . To obtain such triangles, we divide all of our unit squares by first cutting them into $ab$ rectangles of side-lengths $a$ and $b$ , and then cutting each rectangle along a diagonal into two right triangles. You can do the calculation to see that we'll have exactly enough triangles to build the big square after cutting up the unit squares. Or you can just observe that the area of the big square equals the sum of the areas of the original unit squares, so we must have exactly the right number of triangles.","Suppose you have unit squares.

They wish to reach the opposite corner. If they can traverse along any face, but cannot fly, what is the length of the shortest path they can take? Pretty obviously the answer to this is $\sqrt{5}$ (from turning it into a net). But I was wondering if there was some generalization of this riddle for other shapes? It seems like the math gets quite messy if there are asymmetries, so for this question, I'd like to assume that every side length is 1. For any n-simplex, I'm fairly sure that the length is 1. Though it doesn't really make sense to define an ""opposite"", any vertex is 1 away from another, so it also doesn't really matter. I guess I can define opposition as any pair of vertices which have the longest traversal length. But I'm having trouble with generalizing it for other polytopes. An octahedron would have $\sqrt{3}$ , an icosahedron would have $\sqrt{7}$ , a dodecahedron would have $\sqrt{\frac{7 \sqrt{5} + 17}{2}}$ , and a tesseract would have $2 \sqrt{2}$ (the diagonals of 2 squares). But I'm not really sure how to compute this value for things like 120-cells, 600-cells, n-cubes, and n-orthoplexes. I'm also interested in generalizing it so that traversal can also be higher dimensional. For an ant with 3-dimensional traversal, they would be able to traverse the cube in $\sqrt{3}$ and the octahedron in $\sqrt{2}$ (as these are the diameters of the circumscribed spheres). For a tesseract, they would be able to traverse along every diagonal within a cell, rather than just the faces, though I haven't figured out the length yet. I would appreciate any help on this generalization, even some Mathematica code would be valuable to me.

It seems like the math gets quite messy if there are asymmetries, so for this question, I'd like to assume that every side length is 1. For any n-simplex, I'm fairly sure that the length is 1. Though it doesn't really make sense to define an ""opposite"", any vertex is 1 away from another, so it also doesn't really matter. I guess I can define opposition as any pair of vertices which have the longest traversal length. But I'm having trouble with generalizing it for other polytopes. An octahedron would have , an icosahedron would have , a dodecahedron would have , and a tesseract would have (the diagonals of 2 squares). But I'm not really sure how to compute this value for things like 120-cells, 600-cells, n-cubes, and n-orthoplexes. I'm also interested in generalizing it so that traversal can also be higher dimensional. For an ant with 3-dimensional traversal, they would be able to traverse the cube in and the octahedron in (as these are the diameters of the circumscribed spheres). For a tesseract, they would be able to traverse along every diagonal within a cell, rather than just the faces, though I haven't figured out the length yet. I would appreciate any help on this generalization, even some Mathematica code would be valuable to me.

It seems simple enough that I suspect it might have a name already (and hopefully be solved), but I can't find anything. So I'll state the problem here, maybe it sounds familiar. Consider some finite closed curve in 2D (for simplicity). Take some random point inside (strictly) the curve. Draw lines radially outward from the point onto the curve. This process creates some map $R(\theta)$ . It's obvious that this won't always be a function, sometimes a $\theta$ corresponds to multiple $R$ , i.e. the line intersects the curve twice. Is there a way to, given a curve in some form, figure out if $R(\theta)$ can be a function? So figure out if there exists a point somewhere such that no line intersects the curve twice? And better then proving existence, can such a point be found reliable through some algorithm? Better yet, for curves where multiple points are necessary, can that be solved too and can some points be found? This whole thing reminds me of the illumination problem. It's like a reflectionless illumination problem, except I need to know specifically where the point(s) need(s) to be for an arbitrary curve. The reason I'm interested in this btw is that it might be useful to encode surfaces by mapping distance functions like this, which can then be compressed with spherical harmonics. To be able to do an arbitrary surface I need to solve this problem pretty much. Update: Turns out this is called the 'art gallery problem' (if you replace the curves by a polygon). It's a very hard CS problem, nothing close to a solution exists, just an upper bound on the number of points necessary. Any ideas and resources on approximately solving these questions (so using more points than necessary) are appreciated!","I have this interesting, seemingly difficult problem I came across while think about rendering.

Therefore, $a^2 = \dfrac{ 25(5 - y_0)^2 - 4 y_0^2 }{ (5- y_0)^2 - y_0^2 }$ $b^2 = \dfrac{ 25(5 - y_0)^2 - 4 y_0^2 }{21} $ And these give: $a = 5.902508, b = 3.396089 $ So that the equation of the ellipse is now fully specified.

What I have tried: From symmetry, and orientation of the trapezoid, the center of the ellipse is at and its equation is Since is on the ellipse, then Since is on the ellipse, then which are two equation in three unknowns, and they are linear in and , hence, it can be solved readily to obtain: Therefore, the area of the ellipse is And now to find the minimum area, I differentiate with respect to implies that Multiplying through by , I get, Which simplifies to the following quadratic equation, The solutions of which are: and The second one is extraneous.  Therefore, And these give: So that the equation of the ellipse is now fully specified.

96,How Can I Visualize a PDE Boundary Condition?,How Can I Visualize a PDE Boundary Condition?,,"In this question, the comment suggests that the integration bounds in the Fourier Series should be chosen to avoid discontinuities in the boundary conditions.  I am trying to produce a nice visual to see this sort of discontinuity. The visual I have in mind is a curve in 3-dimensional space, which lives somewhere within the infinite cylinder $r = 1$ .  I want to know if there is an easy way to draw this, i.e., in Mathematica. As a workaround, I created a 2-dimensional graph in Desmos... I assume the way to determine from a 2-dimension graph like this that the boundary condition is continuous from $0$ to $2\pi$ is to note that the green line is continuous and that its endpoints are the same.  By contrast, the red line is also continuous, but its endpoints are not the same, so the boundary condition is not continuous from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ .  This is based on the idea of wrapping each of these intervals around the cylinder.  Is this approach on point? How can I actually graph the 3-dimensional boundary condition without knowing the solution to the PDE in Mathematica, MATLAB, or some online graphing tool?","In this question, the comment suggests that the integration bounds in the Fourier Series should be chosen to avoid discontinuities in the boundary conditions.

Posting here for verification. The diagram below shows Thales's theorem $$\tag{1} 2\color{red}{\phi}+2\color{green}{\gamma}=\pi \implies \angle BDC=\frac{\pi}{2}.$$ In order to generalise Thales, consider any segment $FG \parallel BC$ on $\bigcirc$ .
