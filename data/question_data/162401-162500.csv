76,*Weak Lusin* vs *Strong Lusin*,*Weak Lusin* vs *Strong Lusin*,,"In a book that I’m reading, the author presents two versions of Lusin’s theorem: Let $X$ be a topological space with a regular measure $\mu$ , and $Y$ to be second countable (i.e., admits a countable family $(B_i)_i$ Of open sets such that for any open set $B \subset Y$ , we can represent $B$ as an union of $B_i$ ’s). Weak Lusin - Under the above assumptions, if $f: X \to Y$ is measurable, then, for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a compact set $K\subset X$ s.t $\mu(K^c) <\epsilon$ and $f \mid_K $ is continuous. Strong Lusin - Under the same assumptions, if $f:X\to \mathbb R^d$ measurable, then for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists a compact set $K\subset X$ and a continuous function $g:X\to \mathbb R^d$ s.t $\mu(K^c) <\epsilon$ and $f=g$ on $K$ .

I can’t quite comprehend how the existence of a function $g$ coinciding with a function $f$ on $K$ , differs from having a continuous function $f$ only on $K$ . Is the different mainly due to the fact that exists a function $g$ continuous? Another different seems to be the change in the space $Y$ . The strong version is restricted to $\mathbb R^d$ . Can anyone clarify the difference in this two versions?

Weirdly, though, I could not find any sources with the formula. So I have several requests/questions: What is the motivation of the formula? Where does it come up naturally and how would you discover it? More examples or better: references for this formula would be much appreciated. Theorem. Let $(X, \mathfrak{A}, \mu)$ and $([0,\infty], \mathfrak{B}([0,\infty]), \nu)$ be $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces with $$ \varphi(t) = \nu([0,t)) \quad \text{for } t \geq 0. $$ Then, for measurable $f:X \to [0,\infty]$ we have $$ \int_X \varphi \circ f \ d \mu = \int_{[0,\infty)} \mu(f>t) \ d\nu(t). $$ Proof. Follows quickly with Tonelli's theorem. I mentioned that it seems overly useful. Here are examples that our professor presented (in short): Letting $d\nu(t) = pt^{p-1} d\lambda(t)$ we get $$ \int_X f^p \ d \mu = p \int_0^\infty t^{p-1} \mu(f>t) \ dt$$ which in particular gives an alternate definition for $\int_X f \ d \mu$ for $p = 1$ . Letting $X = [0,\infty), f = \operatorname{id}, d\mu(x) = e^{-x} \ d\lambda(x)$ we get with the above examples $$ \Gamma(p+1) = p \Gamma(p).$$ While it does seem like an overkill here, the formula above could somehow be connected to integration by parts (as the most elementary proof of the functional equation of $\Gamma$ would be by integration by parts)? Letting $\psi : \mathbb{R}^n \to [0,\infty), \ x \mapsto \|x\|_2^2$ and $\nu = \psi \circ \lambda^n$ as well as $d\mu(t) = e^{-t} \ d\lambda(t), f = \operatorname{id}$ we get with some work the volume $\omega_n$ of a $n$ -dimensional sphere $$ \omega_n = \frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}.$$ The main work of the formula was to prove $$ \omega_n \Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\|x\|_2^2} d\lambda(x).$$ An example of mine: I believe that the right substitutions yield the interpretation that the Lebesgue integral describes the area/measure under a graph.

Here are examples that our professor presented (in short): Letting we get which in particular gives an alternate definition for for . Letting we get with the above examples While it does seem like an overkill here, the formula above could somehow be connected to integration by parts (as the most elementary proof of the functional equation of would be by integration by parts)? Letting and as well as we get with some work the volume of a -dimensional sphere The main work of the formula was to prove An example of mine: I believe that the right substitutions yield the interpretation that the Lebesgue integral describes the area/measure under a graph. So the formula would at least be a generalization of that. These example should convince anyone of the usefulness of the formula.","(X, \mathfrak{A}, \mu) ([0,\infty], \mathfrak{B}([0,\infty]), \nu) \sigma  \varphi(t) = \nu([0,t)) \quad \text{for } t \geq 0.  f:X \to [0,\infty]  \int_X \varphi \circ f \ d \mu = \int_{[0,\infty)} \mu(f>t) \ d\nu(t).  d\nu(t) = pt^{p-1} d\lambda(t)  \int_X f^p \ d \mu = p \int_0^\infty t^{p-1} \mu(f>t) \ dt \int_X f \ d \mu p = 1 X = [0,\infty), f = \operatorname{id}, d\mu(x) = e^{-x} \ d\lambda(x)  \Gamma(p+1) = p \Gamma(p). \Gamma \psi : \mathbb{R}^n \to [0,\infty), \ x \mapsto \|x\|_2^2 \nu = \psi \circ \lambda^n d\mu(t) = e^{-t} \ d\lambda(t), f = \operatorname{id} \omega_n n  \omega_n = \frac{\pi^{\frac{n}{2}}}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right)}.  \omega_n \Gamma \left(\frac{n}{2} + 1 \right) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\|x\|_2^2} d\lambda(x).","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-integral']"
