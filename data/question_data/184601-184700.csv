All I know is that $f$ is bijective (injective & surjective). Assume that $f$ is not injective, ie there exist $x_1 < x_2$ such that $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ $$ \begin{align}   f(x_1) &= f(x_2) \\[1ex]   f(f(x_1)) &= f(f(x_2)) \\[1ex]   x_1^3 + 1 &= x_2^3 + 1 \\[1ex]   x_1^3 &= x_2^3 \\[1ex]   x_1 &= x_2 \ \large{\unicode{x21af}} \end{align} $$ The last line is true since $x \mapsto x^3$ is an injective function. (it is strictly monotonic) Assume that $f$ is not surjective, ie there exists a $y_0$ such that $\forall x : f(x) \neq y_0$ $$ \begin{align}   f(x) &\neq y_0 \\[1ex]   f(f(x)) &\neq f(y_0),\quad (f \text{ is injective})  \\[1ex]   x^3 + 1 &\neq f(y_0) \ \large{\unicode{x21af}} \end{align} $$ This is a contradiction since $x^3 + 1$ spans the reals, so $f$ is bijective. I have a feeling that $f$ is discontinuous, although I can't prove it. I find it hard to even find specific values of $f$ , like I only know that $$f(\alpha) = \alpha$$ where $\alpha$ is the real solution to $x = x^3 + 1$ .

For example, $e^x$ can never equal a negative number, and so automatically we know that $e^x$ does not span its codomain (the function's range is smaller than the codomain), which is  ℝ^1. However, we know that $e^x$ does have an inverse , and that inverse is $\ln\left(x\right)$ . Does this go against what the definition of a function being invertible? What am I getting wrong here?

I assume they wouldn't intersect for a base greater than $e$ either. So, I wanted to know what values of $a$ would give the equation $x=a^x$ a solution. The first thing you notice is that $x>0$ because $x=a^x>0$ . Also, the values $a\in(0,1)$ should work based on the shape of exponential decay (and $a=1$ of course), but the challenge is for $a>1$ . The conclusion I reached was that the rest of the values for $a$ should be inside $(1,e)$ . My reasoning uses the fact that $x>\ln(x)$ on the domain of $\ln(x)$ . If you rearrange $x=a^x$ you get $$x=a^x$$ $$\ln(x)=\ln(a^x)$$ $$\ln(x)=x\ln(a)$$ $$\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}=x$$ In order for this equation to be unsolvable, the function on the left must never intersect the function on the right, so one must always be greater. Because $\ln(x)$ grows more slowly, x would have to be the greater function. This leads to the inequality $$x>\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(a)}$$ $$x\ln(a)>\ln(x)$$ This inequality is automatically true if $x\ln(a)>x$ . Dividing on both sides gives $ln(a)>1\rightarrow a>e$ .
