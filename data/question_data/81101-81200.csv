5,Showing injective property of derivative map over vector space of polynomials,Showing injective property of derivative map over vector space of polynomials,,"From S.L Linear Algebra: (1) Let $P_n$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree $ \leq n$ . (2) Then   the derivative $D: P_n \rightarrow P_n$ is a linear map of $P_n$ into   itself. (3) Let $I$ be the identity mapping. Prove that the following linear maps are invertible: (a) $I - D^2$ ... My observation (long): (1) I find a first sentence very interesting: Let $P_n$ be the vector space of polynomials of degree $ \leq n$ . But in order for $P_n$ to be a vector space, it must contain a zero vector, which in vector space of polynomials is given by a zero polynomial which has a very confusing degree . But it is argued that it makes most sense for zero polynomial to have $-\infty$ degree. Hence wouldn't it be more precise to say that $P_n$ is vector space of polynomials that have a degree of $\leq -\infty$ ? In which case $n= -\infty$ ? I don't believe $n$ is associated in any way with dimension of vector space, because in this case this assertion would break rule of cardinality. (2) Then the derivative $D: P_n \rightarrow P_n$ is a linear map of $P_n$ into   itself. This is another interesting assertion. We know that exponent property of derivative will change degree of $p_g \in P_n$ to $g-1$ . In this case, if our polynomial is something like $x^{-\infty + 1}$ , we would get a derivative $\frac{d}{dx} x^{-\infty + 1} = -\infty x^{-\infty}$ which suggests that kernel is not trivial for $D$ and hence our linear derivative map over $P_n$ to $P_n$ is not injective ... And therefore not invertible. I definitely am wrong with this assertion, since it is assumed that $D$ is invertible over $P_n \rightarrow P_n$ (3) Let $I$ be the identity mapping. It is very easy to prove that identity map is both injective and surjective therefore invertible. Since considering that: $I(v) = v$ We can easily see that $Im(I) = P_n$ and $Ker(I) = {0}$ . Polynomials being scalars : Considering that polynomials are scalars, isn't basis of vector space zero-dimensional?

Since $\mathrm{ad}_{X}(A) = [X,A]$, I'm thinking of the linear transformation $ad_{X}:\mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}$ as a matrix of size $n^{2} \times n^{2}$. Since $$ \left( \mathrm{ad}_{X} \circ \mathrm{ad}_{Y}\right)(A) = [X,[Y,A]] = XYA - YAX - XAY + AYX $$ If $M$ is my matrix (with components $M_{(j,k)(p,q)}$) corresponding to $\mathrm{ad}_{X} \circ \mathrm{ad}_{Y}$ in the sense that: $$ \left( \mathrm{ad}_{X} \circ \mathrm{ad}_{Y}\right)(A)_{jk} = \sum_{p,q=1}^{n} M_{(j,k)(p,q)} A_{pq} $$ I'm assuming then that $B(X,Y) = \mathrm{Tr}\left( \mathrm{ad}_{X} \circ \mathrm{ad}_{Y} \right) = \sum_{j,k=1}^{n} M_{(j,k),(j,k)}$. So after a little grinding, I find that: $$ \left( \mathrm{ad}_{X} \circ \mathrm{ad}_{Y}\right)(A)_{jk} = \sum_{p,q=1}^{n} \left[ X_{jp}Y_{pq}A_{qk} - Y_{jp}A_{pq}X_{qk} - X_{jp}A_{pq}Y_{qk} + A_{jp}Y_{pq}X_{qk} \right] \\ = \sum_{p,q=1}^{n} \left[ \sum_{\ell=1}^{n} \left( X_{j\ell}Y_{\ell p} \delta_{kq} + Y_{q\ell} X_{\ell k} \delta_{j p} \right) - X_{jp} Y_{qk} - Y_{jp} X_{qk} \right] A_{pq} \\ $$ Where $\delta$ is the kronecker delta. So my matrix components are: $$ M_{(j,k)(p,q)} = \sum_{\ell=1}^{n} \left( X_{j\ell}Y_{\ell p} \delta_{kq} + Y_{q\ell} X_{\ell k} \delta_{j p} \right) - X_{jp} Y_{qk} - Y_{jp} X_{qk} $$ Finally, this tells me that the Killing-form ends up looking like: $$ B(X,Y) = \sum_{j,k=1}^{n} M_{(j,k)(j,k)} \\ = \sum_{j,k=1}^{n} \left[ \sum_{\ell=1}^{n} \left( X_{j\ell}Y_{\ell j} \delta_{kk} + Y_{k\ell} X_{\ell k} \delta_{j j} \right) - X_{jj} Y_{kk} - Y_{jj} X_{kk} \right] \\ = 2n \mathrm{Tr}(XY) - 2 \mathrm{Tr}(X)\mathrm{Tr}(Y) $$ So $B(X,Y) = 2n \mathrm{Tr}(XY) - 2 \mathrm{Tr}(X)\mathrm{Tr}(Y)$, and so far I'm still working with a general Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Looking at $\mathfrak{so}(n)$, I know this this is the set of skew-symmetric real matrices of size $n \times n$, which means they are all traceless.
