0,When do invariant measures arise from smooth differntial forms?,When do invariant measures arise from smooth differntial forms?,,"It is well known that the Haar measure of a Lie group $ G $ arises from a invariant differential form density $ |\omega| $ (of top dimension). Also, we know that if we have a closed subgroup $ H \leq G $, then there is the following criterion: $ \exists $ a $ G $-invariant (Radon) measure $ \mu $ on $ G/H $ iff $ \Delta_G|_H = \Delta_H $ (modular functions on the groups) Is there a criterion (in general), when a (arbitrary) measure $ \nu $ on a Lie group $ G $ arises from a smooth differential form or a density? I'm particularly interested in the above case: Does the $ G $-invariant measure $ \mu $ arise from a differential form or a density of the manifold $ G/H $? I guess there is a positive answer to that question, but I don't see how to show that technically (my differential geometry skills are rather moderate).

16,A question about functions in $L^p(E)$,A question about functions in,L^p(E),"I've been working on a problem. I found a couple of related questions on the site, but I was having a little bit of trouble clarifying everything. The goal is to show that given $f\notin L^p(E)$, there exists a $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ such that $fg\notin L^1(E)$. Note this is the second part of Wheeden and Zygmund's Introduction to Real Analysis textbook. To show that for $f\notin L^p(E)$, there exists a $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ such that $fg\notin L^1(E)$, consider the following. Without loss of generality, we can assume all functions are nonnegative. Now, suppose there is a sequence $\{g_k\}_{k=1}^\infty\subseteq L^{p'}(E)$ with $\Vert g_k\Vert_{p'}=1$ and     $$         \int_E fg_k>3^{k}.     $$     Set      $$         g=\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k}g_k     $$     and observe that, by Minkowski's inequality, $\Vert g\Vert_{p'}\leq 1$. Note that     $$         \int_E fg=\int_E f\sum_{k=1}^\infty 2^{-k}g_k>\int_E\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{k}=\infty.     $$     Thus, $g\in L^{p'}(E)$ but $fg\notin L^1(E)$.     Hence, we have reduced the problem to showing that such a sequence exists. First note that if $f=\infty$ on any set $A$ of positive measure, then we can simply take $$g=\frac{1}{|B|}\text{ when }x\in B$$ where $B\subseteq A$ has positive, finite measure, and $g=0$ otherwise. Thus $g$ has the desired properties. This implies we can assume $f$ is finite a.e., and in particular, for any positive real number $c$, we can find a set $F$ with finite measure such that $\int_F f=c$. With this in mind, we can find a nested sequence of sets $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$, each with finite measure, such that $\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k=E$ and $\int_{E_k}f>3^k$. Now, take     $$g_k=\frac{1}{|E_k|^{\frac{1}{p'}}} :\ x\in E_k$$     By construction, $\Vert g_k\Vert_{p'}=1$, and it is easy to check that $\int fg_k\longrightarrow\infty$ as $k\to\infty$. Hence, we have the existence of the sequence, and we've demonstrated the existence of such functions $g$. Does this seem sufficient? The last part seems to be a little bit lacking, but I'm not quite sure why I feel it's unjustified. Thanks in advance!","I've been working on a problem.

But I decided to create a new post to see if I am proving this theorem correctly. Theorem 1.19 - If $E\subset \mathbb{R}$ , TFAE: a.) $E\in M_{\mu}$ b.) $E = V\setminus N_1$ where $V$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set and $\mu(N_1) = 0$ . c.) $E = H\cup N_2$ where $H$ is a $F_{\sigma}$ set and $\mu(N_2) = 0$ Proof a.) implies b.) - If $E\subset\mathbb{R}$ and $E\in M_{\mu}$ then by lemma 1.17 $$\mu(E) = \inf\{\sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu((a_j,b_j)):E\subset \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(a_j,b_j)\}$$ so, $E\subset \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(a_j,b_j)$ and $\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(a_j,b_j)$ is open. Let $U_n = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(a_j,b_j)$ then clearly $U_{n+1}\subseteq U_n$ that contains $E$ such that $$\mu(E) > \mu(U_n) - \frac{1}{n}$$ Thus, $$\mu(E)\geq \mu\left(\bigcap_{1}^{\infty} U_n\right)$$ Since by monotonocity, $\mu(E)\leq \mu(U_n)$ for all $n$ , this implies that $$\mu(E) = \mu\left(\bigcap_{1}^{\infty}U_n\right)$$ Set $V = \bigcap_{1}^{\infty}U_n$ and $N_1 = \left(\bigcap_{1}^{\infty}U_n\setminus E\right)$ then clearly $E = V\setminus N_1$ where $V$ is a $F_{\delta}$ set and $\mu(N_1) = 0$ . Thus a.) implies b.). Proof a.) implies c.) Following the same reasoning as above we see that taking the complement of $V$ and setting equal to $H$ we get $$H = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}U_n^c$$ which is a $F_{\sigma}$ set. Recall that $$E = V\setminus N_1 = V\cap N_1^c$$ and $$(V\cap N_1^c)^c = H\cup N_1$$ where $N_1 = \left(\bigcap_{1}^{\infty}U_n\setminus E\right)$ and $N_1^c = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}U_n^c\cup E$ set $N_1^c = N_2$ since $\mu(N_1) = 0$ then $\mu(N_2) = 0$ and thus a.) implies c.).
