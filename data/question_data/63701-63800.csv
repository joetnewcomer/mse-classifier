I need to find how many triplets(a,b,c) of vertices are there, such that on the path from vertex a to b, vertex b to c and vertex c to a there is atleast one edge having red color. It should be noted that (a,b,c), (b,a,c) and all such permutation will be considered as the same triplets. EXAMPLE : Let N=5 and edges with colors are as follow : 1 2 b 2 3 r 3 4 r 4 5 b Here answer will be 4. EXPLANATION : (2,3,4) is one such triplet because on all paths i.e 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 2 to 4 there is atleast one edge having read color. (2,3,5), (1,3,4) and (1,3,5) are such other triplets. Here is my approach : Count the triplets that don't have this property, and subtract from the total number of triplets. If you have a path made entirely of black edges, any third node will create such a triplet, so there are N-2 such triplets.

I use the method as following to find out the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 2. Count the number of monic not irreducible polynomials of degree 2: If a monic polynomial $f(x)\in \mathbb F_{p}$ is of degree 2 and not irreducible, $f(x)=(x-\alpha)g(x)$ for some $g(x) \in \mathbb F_{p}$. As   $deg(g)=2-deg(x-\alpha)=2-1=1$.So $g=x-\beta$ for some $\beta \in \mathbb F$. Thus all the not irreducible monic polynomial of degree $2$ is of the form $f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta)$. If $\alpha =\beta$ $f(x)=(x-\alpha)^2$. We have $p$ polynomials $f(x)$ in this form. If $\alpha \neq \beta$ , we have ${p \choose 2}=\frac{p!}{2!(p-2)!}=\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$ polynomials $f(x)$ in this form. Hence, the total number of monic not irreducible polynomials of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ is $p+\frac{p(p-1)}{2}=\frac{p(p+1)}{2}$ Monic polynomial of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ has the form $x^2+ax+b$ with $a,b \in\mathbb F_{p}[x]$. Thus we have $p^2$ such polymials. Thus the number of irreducible polynomial of degree $2$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ is $p^2-\frac{p(p+1)}{2}=\frac{p^2-p}{2}$ But when I turn to find out the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree 3. I find that all the not irreducible monic polynomial of degree $2$ is of the form $f(x)=(x-\alpha)(x^2+cx+d)$,so it seems that we have $p$ choices of $\alpha$,  $p$ choices of $c$ and $p$ choices of $d$, thus we have $p^3$ not irreducible polynomials of degree $3$ in $ \mathbb F_{p}$. But monic polynomial of degree $3$ in $\mathbb F_{p}[x]$ has the form $x^3+a_{1}x^2+a_{2}x+a_{3}$ with $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3} \in\mathbb F_{p}[x]$. Thus we have $p^3$ such monoc polymials.
