0,Properties of modular arithmetic without equivalence classes,Properties of modular arithmetic without equivalence classes,,"With modular arithmetic, it seems possible to define the addition operation without imposing equivalence classes. That is, with the set of remainders when dividing by $n$ as $\{0, ..., n - 1\}$ , we can define the addition between members of this set to be the usual integer sum in $\mathbb{Z}$ , reduced modulo $n$ . My university notes say that, with this definition, addition is well-defined but that its properties are difficult to glean. As a result, equivalence classes are imposed and addition occurs between these classes. My questions are: (1) why is it difficult to glean the properties of the original addition (please provide examples to make it clearer) and (2) how does the introduction of equivalence classes solve this problem? Below is an excerpt from the notes I am referring to: Another group with a different flavor is $(\mathbb{Z}/(n\mathbb{Z}), +)$ , the integers modulo $n ≥ 2$ integer: as a set, this can be identified with $\{0, 1, . . . , n − 1\}$ (the remainders when dividing by $n$ in integers), and addition gives the usual sum in $\mathbb{Z}$ , reduced modulo $n$ , so e.g. in $(\mathbb{Z}/(5\mathbb{Z}), +)$ , $2 + 4 = 1$ . It is less confusing though to write $\{[0], . . . , [n − 1]\}$ for the set, and $[2] + [4] = [1]$ then; below we see why this is a good notation. With this definition, addition is well defined on $(\mathbb{Z}/(n\mathbb{Z}), +)$ , but it can be quite awkward to check its properties. It is usually better to proceed as follows: we partition (divide into disjoint sets) $\mathbb{Z}$ into equivalence classes, and say that $a$ and $b$ are in the same class, or $a ∼ b$ , if $a − b$ is divisible by $n$ , i.e. if $a$ and $b$ differ by a multiple of $n$ .

84,Frattini subgroup of a finite elementary abelian $p$-group is trivial,Frattini subgroup of a finite elementary abelian -group is trivial,p,"I would like to improve my proof of the following result: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. Here, $\Phi(H)$ is the Frattini subgroup, defined as the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $H$. An elementary abelian $p$-group is an abelian group with the property that $x^p = 1$ for all $x \in H$. I proved this by choosing an arbitrary nonidentity element $x \in H$ and showing that there exists a maximal subgroup $M < H$ which does not contain $x$. My proof explicitly constructs $M$. I wonder if there is a cleaner, more elegant way to establish the existence of $M$ without resorting to a construction . My proof: Let $x \in H$ be a nonidentity element. Define $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $|N_1| = p$. If $N_1 < H$, choose $x_2 \in H \setminus N_1$, and define $N_2 = \langle x_2\rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2$ is a subgroup, with $N_1 \cap N_2 = 1$, so $N_1 N_2$ is a direct product with order $p^2$. If $N_1 N_2 < H$, we continue in the same way. By step $k$ we start with a direct product $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ with order $p^{k-1}$. If this subgroup is proper, choose $x_k \in H \setminus N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ and define $N_k = \langle x_k \rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_k$ is a direct product with order $p^k$. Since $H$ is finite, this process eventually terminates and we end up with $H = N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, where $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $M = N_2 \cdots N_m$ is a maximal subgroup of $H$ which does not contain $x$: Maximality is clear because the index of $N_2\cdots N_m$ is $p$. If $x \in N_2 \cdots N_m$ then we can write $x$ in two different ways in $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, namely $(x)(1)\cdots(1) = (1)(n_2)\cdots(n_m)$. The uniqueness of representation in a direct product then forces $x = 1$. Context: This question addresses a remark made by Isaacs in Finite Group Theory , following problem 1.D.8: If $G$ is a finite $p$-group, then $\Phi(G)$ is the unique normal subgroup of $G$ minimal with the property that the factor group is elementary abelian. I proved this by establishing the following results: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. If $\theta : G \to H$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $\theta(\Phi(G)) \leq \Phi(H)$. Therefore, if $K \lhd G$ and $G/K$ is elementary abelian, then $\Phi(G) \leq K$.","I would like to improve my proof of the following result: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. Here, $\Phi(H)$ is the Frattini subgroup, defined as the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $H$. An elementary abelian $p$-group is an abelian group with the property that $x^p = 1$ for all $x \in H$. I proved this by choosing an arbitrary nonidentity element $x \in H$ and showing that there exists a maximal subgroup $M < H$ which does not contain $x$. My proof explicitly constructs $M$. I wonder if there is a cleaner, more elegant way to establish the existence of $M$ without resorting to a construction . My proof: Let $x \in H$ be a nonidentity element. Define $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $|N_1| = p$. If $N_1 < H$, choose $x_2 \in H \setminus N_1$, and define $N_2 = \langle x_2\rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2$ is a subgroup, with $N_1 \cap N_2 = 1$, so $N_1 N_2$ is a direct product with order $p^2$. If $N_1 N_2 < H$, we continue in the same way. By step $k$ we start with a direct product $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ with order $p^{k-1}$. If this subgroup is proper, choose $x_k \in H \setminus N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ and define $N_k = \langle x_k \rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_k$ is a direct product with order $p^k$. Since $H$ is finite, this process eventually terminates and we end up with $H = N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, where $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $M = N_2 \cdots N_m$ is a maximal subgroup of $H$ which does not contain $x$: Maximality is clear because the index of $N_2\cdots N_m$ is $p$. If $x \in N_2 \cdots N_m$ then we can write $x$ in two different ways in $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, namely $(x)(1)\cdots(1) = (1)(n_2)\cdots(n_m)$. The uniqueness of representation in a direct product then forces $x = 1$. Context: This question addresses a remark made by Isaacs in Finite Group Theory , following problem 1.D.8: If $G$ is a finite $p$-group, then $\Phi(G)$ is the unique normal subgroup of $G$ minimal with the property that the factor group is elementary abelian. I proved this by establishing the following results: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. If $\theta : G \to H$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $\theta(\Phi(G)) \leq \Phi(H)$. Therefore, if $K \lhd G$ and $G/K$ is elementary abelian, then $\Phi(G) \leq K$.",,"['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"
