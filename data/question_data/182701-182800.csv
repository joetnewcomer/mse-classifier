For example $x^4 + x^3$ looks a little wobbly when it gets near the x axis. The function $\sin(x)$ is extremely wobbly. The function $\sin(x) + x$ is also extremely wobbly. What is a mathematical expression that seems to calculate how ""wobbly"" a function $f(x)$ is? What I've done so far: At first I thought ""wobbly"" was just the slope changing quickly. To measure how fast the slope is changing, that would be the slope of the slope, and we don't care about direction, so we obtain: $$w_1(f; a, b) = \int_a^b | f''(x) | dx$$ where $w_1$ is the first definition I've come up with for the ""wobbliness"" of a function from $x = a$ to $x = b$ where $a < b$ . However, when I tested this on the function $f_1(x) = x^4 + x^3 - x^2 - x$ , it didn't seem right. $f_1$ seems to be wobbly from $-1$ to $1$ .

My next thought was that maybe I'm counting how often a function is switching from a non-zero slope to a zero slope over a particular range. This would make $f_1$ be wobbly from $-1$ to $1$ , and would also make $\sin(x)$ be very wobbly as well. However, I didn't even attempt to come up with a mathematical formula for this definition (which I will call $w_2$ ), because I recognized that $f_2 = \sin(x) + 2x$ would be a counterexample. It's also very wobbly, but its slope is never 0. Interestingly enough, $w_1$ seems to do a good job of measuring where $f_2$ is wobbly.

It is silently assumed that $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$. Physicists do not even think about a discontinuous alternative. The sinc function is only an example of a far more general claim, uttered by one of my heroes, the great mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer . It is (not very well) known as Brouwer's Continuity Theorem, grossly stating that every real-valued function is continuous. More precisely, as quoted from Strong Counterexamples : ""In intuitionistic mathematics, the Brouwer Continuity Theorem states that all total real functions are (uniformly) continuous on the unit interval"". Real valued, physical quantities have uncertainties. That is one of the fundamental properties of physics. And it isn't just due to quantum considerations. Take an average metal bar. It has no exact length. There are for example temperature fluctuations (atoms in motion) which will cause the bar's length to fluctuate. This effectively means that any real number in physics is accompanied with an uncertainty, an error , often denoted as $\delta$ or $\varepsilon$. Consider the classical mathematical definition of continuity of a function. All numbers are assumed to be real-valued. A function $f(x)$ is said to be continuous at $x=a$ if and only if for all $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $|x-a| < \delta$ then $|f(x)-f(a)| < \varepsilon$, where it may be that $x \ne a$. A physical interpretation of this might be formulated as follows: an error in a continuous function can be made as small as desired by adapting the error in the function's argument accordingly. Due to the errors, $|x-a|<\delta$ is physically the same as $x\approx a$ ($x$ equals $a$ approximately) and this can be said for $f(x)$ and $f(a)$ as well. So we can even write $\; x\approx a \,\Longrightarrow\, f(x)\approx f(a)\;$ , as a (sloppy) definition of continuity. The latter formulation is even closer to Brouwer's Continuity Theorem, if we replace the $\,\approx\,$ by a common equal sign: $\; x=a \,\Longrightarrow\, f(x)=f(a)\;$ , expressing the idea that a function is continuous where it really is .. a function! Now consider again the above suck function. Whatever small it might be, inevitably there is an error in the argument, meaning that $x=0$ should actually be replaced by an interval $|x-0| < \delta$. There are values $x\ne 0$ in that interval, though, and $\,\lim_{x\to 0} \operatorname{suck}(x) = 1$. Hence, physically speaking, $\operatorname{suck}(0) = 1\,$ and $\operatorname{suck}(0) = 0\,$ must be true at the same time. Which is impossible. IMHO this is the reason why $\operatorname{suck}(0) = 1\,$ is involved automatically in physics, resulting inevitably in our old friend the sinc function and nothing else. I'm well aware of the fact that this way of physical reasoning does not involve all sorts of continuity that mathematicians might think of. So the question is what sorts of continuity are sensitive to the automatism that is present in the sinc function and what sorts of continuity are distinct from this. It's a somewhat vague question, but I am a humble physicist by education and I do not know of any better way to formulate it. EDIT. A far more simple example of a function with the same sort of ""automatism"" as with the $\operatorname{sinc}$ function is given by: $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} (x^2-1)/(x-1) & \text{for } x \ne 1 \\ 2 & \text{for } x=1 \end{cases} $$ Which is physically the same as $\,f(x) = x+1$ .

Let $f$ be a differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ such that $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x + y) = f(x)f(y)\tag{1}$ If $y=0$ then $f(x + 0) = f(x)f(0)$ which is just $f(x) = f(x)f(0)$ . Then if $f(0) = 0$ , we have $f(x) = f(x)f(0) = f(x) \cdot 0 = 0$ for all $x$ . If $f(0) \neq 0$ instead then $f(0) = f(0 + 0) = f(0)f(0) = f(0)^2$ implies that $0 = f(0)^2 - f(0) = f(0)(f(0) - 1)$ which has solutions $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$ , but since we assume $f(0) \neq 0$ , it must be the case that $f(0) = 1$ . Furthermore let's assume the possibility of some real $z$ such that $f(z) = 0$ . Then for all $x$ we have $f(x) = f(z + (x - z)) = f(z)f(x-z) = 0 \cdot f(x-z) = 0$ . In other words, if the function equals $0$ at one point, it is zero for all of them. The contrapositive is that if the function is nonzero for any value, then it does not equal $0$ anywhere else. Therefore in the case where $f(0) = 1$ , we have $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ . Going forward we assume the case where $f(0) = 1 \tag{2}$ By induction, $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ for all positive integers $n>0$ as follows. Base case with $n=1$ , we have $f(x)^1 = f(1 \cdot x)$ which is $f(x) = f(x)$ which is trivially true. Inductive step we assume $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ and we must show that $f(x)^{n+1} = f((n+1)x)$ . $\begin{align} f(x)^n &= f(nx) & \text{By inductive hypothesis}\\ f(x)^n f(x) &= f(nx)f(x) \\ f(x)^{n+1} &= f(nx + x) & \text{By equation (1)}\\ f(x)^{n+1} &= f((n+1)x) \end{align}$ Thus for the positive integers we prove the result: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^{+}}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{3}$ Next we see that $f(x) = f(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2}) = f(\frac{x}{2})^2$ and since any real number squared is non-negative, we combine this with our assumption that $f(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and so it follows that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x) > 0 \tag{4}$ so we are free to divide by $f(x)$ values safely without concerning ourselves with division by $0$ issues. Since $1 = f(0) = f(x + (-x)) = f(x)f(-x)$ it follows that $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x)^{-1} = f(-x) \tag{5}$ Then for some negative integer $n < 0$ we have $f(x)^n = (f(x)^{-n})^{-1} = f(-nx)^{-1} = f(nx)$ by $(3)$ and $(5)$ . Therefore: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z^{-}}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{6}$ We can also directly show that $f(x)^n = f(nx)$ holds for $n=0$ , since $f(x)^0 = 1 = f(0 \cdot x) = f(0)$ which holds by assumption $(2)$ . Now we can conclude: $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \, f(x)^n = f(nx)\tag{7}$ Now if we have $n \neq 0$ we can take the $n$ th root of both sides of equation $(7)$ and get $f(x) = f(nx)^{1/n}$ which also implies that $f(x/n) = f(x)^{1/n}$ . Then for integers $m, n$ with $n \neq 0$ we have $f(m \frac{x}{n}) = f(mx)^{1/n}$ using this result, and then applying equation $(3)$ we transform it to $(f(x)^m)^{1/n}$ or $f(x)^{m/n}$ (again for $n \neq 0$ ). If we let some rational $r = m/n$ then we see that $\forall r \in \mathbb{Q}, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}, f(rx) = f(x)^r \tag{8}$ By setting $x=1$ it is revealed that $\forall r \in \mathbb{Q}, \, f(r) = f(1)^r \tag{9}$ And then there's some theory I don't understand that I can apply here when $f$ is continuous (as assumed up front since we say $f$ is differentiable) that lets me jump to $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \, f(x) = f(1)^x \tag{10}$ Is my proof right so far?","This question already has an answer here : continuous functions on $\mathbb R$ such that $g(x+y)=g(x)g(y)$ [duplicate] (1 answer) Closed 5 years ago .

Because $f$ is surjective there exists $a,b \in A$ such that $f(a)=x$ and $f(b)=y$ $\implies g(f(a))=g(f(b))$ $\implies g\circ f(a)=g\circ f(b)$ $\implies a=b$ (by injectivity of $g\circ f$) $\implies f(a)=f(b)$ $\implies x=y$ Would appreciate any correction in proof writing also!",,['functions']

A function from set $A$ to set $B$, denoted by   $$f:A\to B;x\mapsto f(x)$$   is a mapping of elements from set $A$, (the $\textit{domain}$) to elements in set $B$ (the $\textit{codomain}$) using the $\color{blue}{\sf function}$ $f(x)$. The domain of a function is the set of all valid elements for a function to map from. The codomain of a function is the set of all possible values that an element from the domain can be mapped to. The $\textit{range}$ (sometimes called the $\textit{image}$) of a function is a subset of the codomain, and is the set of all elements that actually get mapped to by the function $f$. Here I'm pretty sure the highlighted word ""function"" is not right.",,"['functions', 'terminology']"

So we've heard of a set being described as ""closed under"" an operation, as well as an operation being ""closed over"" a set. First, correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression is that these things mean the same thing. Second, does this terminology have a precise definition? For instance we'd normally say that set $A$ is closed under $f:X\rightarrow Y$ if $A\subseteq X$ and for any $x\in A$, $f(x)\in A$.  But it's also common to extend the definition such that $X$ isn't a superset of $A$ but of $A^n$ for some $n$.  For instance, we'd say $A$ is closed under addition if the addition operator maps elements of $A^2$ to $A$.  Does this extend to anything bigger than $n$-tuples?  Infinite sequences, for instance? Third, what's the motivation for this terminology and is it in any way related to the normal topological definition of closedness?  There's a way that closed sets are related to sets that are closed under a particular operation in certain topological spaces (if you allow the usage that includes infinite sequences as above), but I haven't come up with a general relation between the two concepts.  What's the motivation for saying an operation is closed over a set though, or is that just a corruption of the former?  Does anyone know the historical reasoning behind any of this terminology?","I've been trying to teach my partner some set theory, and I got thrown for a loop while trying to give her a precise definition of some basic terminology.
