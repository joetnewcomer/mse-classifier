0,$\arctan$ identities: converting $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) \iff \arctan(\frac{n'}{d'})$,identities: converting,\arctan c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) \iff \arctan(\frac{n'}{d'}),"If one has an expression of the form $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d})$, it can be converted to an equivalent expression of the form $\arctan(\frac{n'}{d'})$ fairly easily, using $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) = \underbrace{\arctan(\frac{n}{d}) + \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) + \dots + \arctan(\frac{n}{d})}_{\text{c}}$ with the identity $\arctan(\frac{a}{b}) + \arctan(\frac{c}{d}) = \arctan(\frac{a \cdot d + c \cdot b}{b \cdot d - a \cdot c})$ It can be seen, for example, that $4 \cdot \arctan(\frac{1}{5}) = \arctan(\frac{120}{119})$. The inverse conversion seems to be a bit more complicated. If one is given, for example $\arctan(\frac{237}{3116})$, what would the best method to determine its 'simplest representation'? I will define this as the form $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d})$, such that $c \in \mathbb{Z}$; $n, d \in \mathbb{N}$, and $d$ has the smallest value possible. For the example above, the simplest representation would be $2 \cdot \arctan(\frac{3}{79})$. My current method is the following: Approximate the fraction $\frac{n}{d}$ as a decimal value. Take the $\tan$ of this value, and divide by a small integer factor $q$. Take the $\arctan$ of this quotient, and approximate to the nearest fraction with denominator no larger than ~$10^{12}$ (or a few orders of magnitude less than floating point precision). Continue until a simplification is found, or give up after $q$ becomes 'too large'. This method works, sort of, but it has a lot of problems. It's very slow computationally, it's non-deterministic, and it often finds simplifications that are only approximations, and not exact identities. I'm quite sure that there must be a better method for this, but I've been unable to find one. Thanks in advance.","If one has an expression of the form $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d})$, it can be converted to an equivalent expression of the form $\arctan(\frac{n'}{d'})$ fairly easily, using $c \cdot \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) = \underbrace{\arctan(\frac{n}{d}) + \arctan(\frac{n}{d}) + \dots + \arctan(\frac{n}{d})}_{\text{c}}$ with the identity $\arctan(\frac{a}{b}) + \arctan(\frac{c}{d}) = \arctan(\frac{a \cdot d + c \cdot b}{b \cdot d - a \cdot c})$ It can be seen, for example, that $4 \cdot \arctan(\frac{1}{5}) = \arctan(\frac{120}{119})$.

I can show the result if $n$ is a power of $2$, but if $n$ is anything else I reach a point where I can no longer proceed. My current method (for when $n$ is a power of $2$) is to note that all of the angle that sin is being evaluated on are evenly distributed between $0$ and $\pi$, but more importantly, one of the angles will always be $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and all angles which are greater than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ can be re-written as the cos of an angle that is less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (using the complementary angle). When this is done, we get $$\prod_{k=1}^{n-1}\sin\frac{k \pi}{n} = \prod_{k = 1}^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}\frac{1}{2}\sin\frac{2k\pi}{n} = \frac{1}{2^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}}\prod_{k = 1}^{\lfloor\frac{n - 1}{2}\rfloor}\sin\frac{k\pi}{\frac{n}{2}}$$ This process can then be repeated recursively until we have just one $\sin$ term left in the product (which will be $\sin\frac{\pi}{2}$), then what is left is equivalent to $$\frac{n}{2^{n - 1}}\;.$$ Can anyone suggest a way of generalizing this to when $n$ is not a power of $2$?

97,Solve $\cos2A+\sin A=2$,Solve,\cos2A+\sin A=2,"So they tell me solve $\cos2A+\sin A=2$. Ok guys I found the problem :/ I was wondering why he gave us this question but its actually $$\cos2A+\sin A=-2$$ and I simplified to  $-2x^2+x+3=0$, which has solutions $x= 3/2$, $x=-1$ So I'm guessing then I go but this cannot be found so once again I am lost.","So they tell me solve $\cos2A+\sin A=2$.

Actually this is true for any $n>1$: $1+\cos a+\cos2a+\dots+\cos(n-1)a=0$ (polygon) where $a={2 \pi\over n}$. Easy to show for even $n$ since the $\cos$ cancel themselves 2 at a time but but for odd $n$ (say 5)? This comes from the fact that if you have $n$ same objects equally space around a unit circle, the center of gravity has to be at the origin, so sum of sines equals zero (easy) and sum of cosine also, not so easy for odd $n$.","I am trying to prove that: $1+\cos a+\cos 2a+\cos3a+\cos4a=0$ where $a=\frac{2\pi}5$ (pentagon arrangement).
