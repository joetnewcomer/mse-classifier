95,Prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{3n+5}{2n+7} = \frac{3}{2}$ through epsilon delta,Prove that  through epsilon delta,\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{3n+5}{2n+7} = \frac{3}{2},"Prove that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{3n+5}{2n+7} = \frac{3}{2}$ Proof: Let $a_n = \frac{3n+5}{2n+7}$ . Then, $\left | a_n-\frac{3}{2} \right |=\frac{11}{2(2n+7)}<\frac{3}{n}$ . Given $\epsilon > 0$ , choose $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_0 > \frac{3}{\epsilon}$ . Then, for all $n \ge n_0, \left | a_n-\frac{3}{2} \right | < \epsilon $ . Therefore, $\lim a_n = \frac{3}{2}$ . I'm not quite sure I understand this proof. Namely: Where did $\frac{3}{n}$ come from? I guess we just replaced n with $\epsilon$ in the third sentence. How did the fourth sentence follow from the third, and why does that show that 3/2 is the limit? So I tried it myself on another problem, where $a_n = \frac{2n+5}{6n-3}$ , and the limit being $\frac{1}{3}$ : Let $a_n = \frac{2n+5}{6n-3}$ . Then, $\left | a_n-\frac{1}{3} \right |=\left | \frac{6n-6n+15-3}{3(6n-3)} \right |= \left | \frac{12}{3(6n-3)} \right |= 4\left | \frac{1}{6n-3} \right | < \epsilon$ . Dividing by 4, $\left | \frac{1}{6n-3} \right | < \frac{\epsilon}{4}$ . And that's as far as I logically get... I assume the next step is to choose an $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n_0 > \frac{\epsilon}{4}$ , and isolating epsilon, $\epsilon < 4n_0$ . but as you can tell, I'm really lost.","Prove that Proof: Let .
