What is the relevance of openness in the proof?,A compactly supported continuous function on an open subset of  is Riemann integrable. What is the relevance of openness in the proof?,\mathbb R^n,"My book is An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu. A proposition in Subsection 23.2 ( Proposition 23.4 ) is If a continuous function $f: U \to \mathbb R$ defined on an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb R^n$ has compact support, then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $U$ . What is the relevance of openness of $U$ , specifically the proof given? One might argue it's about smooth extensions of $f$ like in Proposition 13.2 for $M = \mathbb R^n$ (which relies on openness of $U$ specifically through Exercise 13.1 although the openness of $U$ is not explicitly used based on the solution provided , but assuming I understand right, I think I know where the openness of $U$ ). But I think the $\tilde{f}$ is not the one in Proposition 13.2 but rather the one in Subsection 23.1 (see (1) below) , which does not make use of any bumps and has no claims of smoothness or continuity, though the $\tilde{f}$ in Proposition 23.4 is of course proven continuous on $\mathbb R^n$ assuming $f$ is continuous on $U$ , open in $\mathbb R^n$ in the same way that the $\tilde{f}$ in Proposition 13.2 is proven smooth on $M$ assuming $f$ is smooth on $U$ , open in $M$ . Part of why I think so is that it says in the proof that $\tilde{f}$ agrees with $f$ on $U$ , but that's not even what the $\tilde{f}$ of Proposition 13.2 does: $\tilde{f}$ agrees with $f$ on an equal or a smaller neighborhood: This is not only explicit in Proposition 13.2 but also emphasized in a remark just before Proposition 13.2 . Additionally, I think $\tilde{f}$ is meant to be an extension not of $f$ but rather of $f|_{\text{supp} f}$ . I ask about this here . Perhaps this should be resolved first. One thing I have in mind about how $U$ 's openness is relevant is some kind of rule like $f$ Riemann integrable on $U$ if $f$ is Riemann integrable on $\text{supp} f (\subseteq U)$ . Another thing I had in mind is something like $\overline \int_U f = \overline \int_U f 1_{\text{supp} f} = \overline \int_{\text{supp} f} f$ and $\underline \int_U f = \underline \int_U f 1_{\text{supp} f} = \underline \int_{\text{supp} f} f$ by the overline and underline versions of Remark 10.7(i) in another book From Calculus to Cohomology by Ib Madsen and Jørgen Tornehave because $U$ is a manifold, because $U$ is open and because $\mathbb R^n$ is manifold...but I think this is overthinking not because this is from another book but because this uses geometry for an elementary analysis proposition. Update: I think I know it now: My mistake in Method 1 is deducing $\tilde{g}$ continuous at $x \in \text{supp} f$ simply because $g$ is continuous at $x$ . This is not necessarily true, but $\tilde{f}$ continuous at $x \in U$ from $f$ 's continuity at $x$ BECAUSE $U$ is open. However, we must also prove $\tilde{f}$ and $\tilde{g}$ are identical. Much like with $T_eG$ and $L(G)$ in Lie algebras , each hand washes the other: $\tilde{g}$ is an extension from a bounded but closed set and therefore while we can use Lebesgue, we can't deduce continuity. $\tilde{f}$ is an extension from an open set but possibly unbounded set and therefore while we can't use Lebesgue, we can deduce continuity. Therefore, the proof of Proposition 23.4 is as follows: For continuous $f: U \to \mathbb R$ with $U$ open in $\mathbb R^n$ and with compact support, there exists a extension of $f$ by zero $\tilde{f}: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ , i.e. $\tilde{f}(x) = f(x) \cdot 1_U(x) + 0 \cdot 1_{U^c}(x)$ which is a continuous extension because $f$ is continuous AND because $U$ is open (and compact support is not used here, I think). Lebesgue's theorem does not directly apply here because $U$ is not given to be bounded. For $g=f|_{\text{supp} f}$ , the restriction of $f$ to its support, we have $\tilde{g}: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ , $\tilde{g}(x) = g(x) \cdot 1_{\text{supp} f}(x) + 0 \cdot 1_{(\text{supp} f)^c}(x))$ , the extension of $g$ by zero. Underemphasized in my opinion : Observe $\tilde{g}$ is not only an extension from a bounded set but also identical to $\tilde{f}$ . In Lebesgue's theorem choose the bounded set $A = \text{supp} f$ , and the bounded function to be $g$ which we can do because $\text{supp} f$ is bounded because $f$ has compact support and say that $\tilde{g}$ is continuous, not because $\tilde{g}$ is an extension of a continuous function, namely $g$ , but because $\tilde{g}$ is identical to a continuous function, namely $\tilde{f}$ . Oh, there's something missing here: We have shown $g=f|_{\text{supp} f}$ is Riemann integrable. How exactly do we get that the original $f$ is Riemann integrable? Intuitively, I guess this has something to do with $(\text{supp} f)^c \subseteq \{f=0\}$ . At this point, I think geometry's/topology's role is done, and analysis has to take over. I guess $$\int_U f = \int_{\text{supp} f} f + \int_{U \cap (\text{supp} f)^c} f = \int_{\text{supp} f} f + 0 = \int_{\text{supp} f} f = \int_{U} f|_{\text{supp} f},$$ but that relies on $\int_U f$ being well-defined in the first place. Hence I suspect some equivalent definition of Riemann integrability or at least some property of Riemann integrability is that $f$ is Riemann integrable if $f_{\text{supp} f}$ is Riemann integrable.

For two measurable functions $g$ and $h$ , define $$\rho(g,h) = \int_E \frac{|g-h|}{1+|g-h|}.$$ Show that $f_n \to f$ in measure on $E$ if and only if $\lim_{n \to \infty} \rho(f_n,f)=0$ . This problem has been asked here ); however, I am having trouble understanding Davide's nebulous and somewhat misleading suggestions (at least to my mind), which I now reproduce: First, a remark: the map $x\mapsto \frac x{1+x}$ is increasing over the set of non-negative real numbers, and is bounded by $1$ . If $f_n\to f$ in measure, fix $\varepsilon$ and integrate over $\{|f_n-f|>\varepsilon\}$ and $\{|f_n-f|\leqslant \varepsilon\}$ . Conversely, if $d(f_n,f)\to 0$ , then $\frac{\varepsilon}{1+\varepsilon}\mu\{|f_n-f|>\varepsilon\}\to 0$ (integrating over the set $\{|f_n-f|>\varepsilon\}$ ). His first remark is somewhat confusing, for it seems to hint as using the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence theorem for convergence in measure, where $1$ serves as the integrable function that dominates the sequence $\frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|}$ of measurable functions converging to $0$ in measure. Hence, $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} = \int_E 0 = 0$$ Yet he goes on to suggest integrating over $\{|f_n-f| > \epsilon\}$ and $\{|f_n-f| \le \epsilon\}$ . Well, I tried this but I couldn't figure out it. For the first integral, we get $$\int_{\{|f_n-f| > \epsilon\}} \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} \le \int_{\{|f_n-f| > \epsilon\}}  \le m(\{x : |f_n(x)-f(x)| > \epsilon \} \to 0 \mbox{ as } n \to \infty $$ However, I couldn't figure out how to show that the second integral is zero or at least converges to $0$ as $n \to \infty$ . I tried showing that $\int_{\{|f_n-f| \le \epsilon \}} \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|}$ is bounded above by $\epsilon$ and then letting $\epsilon \to 0^+$ , which would actually show that $\int_{\{|f_n-f| \le \epsilon \}} \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} = 0$ for every $n$ , but I couldn't get just $\epsilon$ alone. The best I could do is get $\epsilon \cdot m(\{x : |f_n(x)-f(x)| \le \epsilon\})$ , which doesn't obviously go $0$ as $\epsilon \to 0^+$ . As for the converse, I believe I was able to follow his suggestion. If $|f_n-f| > \epsilon$ , then $\frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} > \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}$ and therefore $\int_E \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} > \int_E \frac{\epsilon}{1 + \epsilon} > \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon} \int_{\{f_n-f| > \epsilon\}} = \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon} m(\{x : |f_n(x)-f(x)| > \epsilon\})$ from which we get $$0 = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_E \frac{|f_n-f|}{1+|f_n-f|} \ge \frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon} \lim_{n \to \infty} m(\{x : |f_n(x)-f(x)| > \epsilon\})$$ and hence $\lim_{n \to \infty} m(\{x : |f_n(x)-f(x)| > \epsilon\})=0$ .","Assume .
