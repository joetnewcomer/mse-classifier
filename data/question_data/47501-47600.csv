Since I know the author of this post $-$ Jack D'Aurizio $-$ is familiar with integrals of this type I guess, indeed, for himself it is easily done. However, I have problems proving $(1)$ As we are dealing with an integral involving a Polylogarithm I thought about applying IBP to get rid of the the Polylogarithm. But I am not sure about the right choice of $u$ and $\mathrm dv$ , respectively. My first guess was simply $u=\operatorname{Li}_3(1-z)$ and therefore $\displaystyle\mathrm dv=\frac1{\sqrt{z(1-z)}}$ . From hereon the first problem occurs: integrating $\mathrm dv$ . There are at least the two possibilities $v=\sin^{-1}(2z-1)$ and $v=2\sin^{-1}(\sqrt{z})$ which both lead to the same $\mathrm dv$ but on the other hand imply different results for the first IBP step.

However, I am not capable of evaluating the remaining integrals which involves a combination of the inverse sine function and the Dilogarithm. Again I thought about IBP but I am totally confused what to choose as $u$ and $\mathrm dv$ . Therefore I think I am on the wrong tack. I have dealed with polylogarithmic and logarithmic integrals before but the square roots are causing me trouble. I tried to absorb at least the $\sqrt{1-z}$ within the Trilogarithm and then doing IBP which results in $$\begin{align} \int_0^1\frac{\operatorname{Li}_3(1-z)}{\sqrt{z(1-z)}}\mathrm dz&=\int_0^1\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(1-z)^{n-1/2}}{n^3}\frac{dz}{\sqrt{z}}\\ &=\left[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(1-z)^{n-1/2}}{n^3}2\sqrt{z}\right]_0^1-\int_0^1\frac{\operatorname{Li}_3(1-z)-2\operatorname{Li}_2(1-z)}{(1-z)^{3/2}}\sqrt{z}\mathrm dz\\ &=\color{red}{0}-\int_0^1\frac{\operatorname{Li}_3(1-z)-2\operatorname{Li}_2(1-z)}{(1-z)^{3/2}}\sqrt{z}\mathrm dz \end{align}$$ I am not sure whether this is helpful at all or if it does not make the whole problem more complicated.

(2 answers) Closed 3 years ago . I'm trying to compute $\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{ax}}{1+e^x}dx$, $(0<a<1)$ Let $f$ denote the integrand. I'm using the rectangular contour given by the following curves: $c_1: z(t) = R+it, t \in [0, 2\pi]$ $c_2: z(t) = -t+2\pi i, t \in [-R, R]$ $c_3: z(t) = -R + i (2\pi - t), t \in [0, 2\pi]$ $c_4: z(t) = t, t \in [-R, R]$ There is one singularity within the contour, at $z = \pi i$. Expanding out the denominator as a power series shows that it's a simple pole, and allows us to evaluate the residue as $\displaystyle \lim_{z \rightarrow \pi i} f(z)(z-\pi i) = - e^{a \pi i}$ This is computed by expanding $1+e^z$ as a Taylor series around $\pi i$. The first coefficient will be 0, and the second will be $-1$. The rest will have orders of $(z - \pi i)$ greater than 1, and will thus vanish when we take the limit. So the integral over the entire contour is $- 2\pi i e^{a \pi i}$ An easy enough estimate on the $c_1$ shows that the integral vanishes as $R \rightarrow \infty$. With a variable change, c_3 is the same as c_1 and also vanishes. $c_4$ becomes the integral we want when we take a limit. $c_2$ becomes $c_4$ with a constant: \begin{align*} \int_{c_2} f(z)dz &= \int_{-R}^{R} \frac{e^{-at}e^{a 2\pi i}}{1+e^{-t}e^{2\pi i}}dt \\ &= e^{a 2 \pi i}\int_{-R}^{R} \frac{e^{-at}}{1+e^{-t}}dt \\ &=e^{a 2 \pi i}\int_{R}^{-R} - \frac{e^{au}}{1+e^{u}}du \ \ \ (u = -t, du = -dt)   \\ &= e^{a 2 \pi i}\int_{-R}^{R} \frac{e^{au}}{1+e^{u}}du \\ &= e^{a 2 \pi i} I(R) \end{align*} Where $I(R)$ is the line integral over $c_4$. Putting it all together and taking the limit gives us $\displaystyle \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} I(R) = \frac{- 2\pi i e^{a \pi i}}{(1 + e^{a 2 \pi i}) }$ But this can't be the value of the integral, because it's a real-valued function integrated over $R$.

Expanding the logarithm yields the integral $I_n := \int_0^\infty(\frac{x}{\sinh x})^n\,dx$ , which has recently been asked about here on math.sa . More generally, I'd love to know a closed-form solution for $$\theta(\ell) := -\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^\infty \log\left(1 - \left\lvert \frac{\Gamma(\frac{\ell}{2}+ix)}{\Gamma(\frac{\ell}{2})}\right\rvert^2\right)\,dx$$ with $\ell\in\mathbb{N}$ . For $\ell=2$ this is the same integral as above; see below for details. The integral $\theta(\ell)$ has some relation to the eigenvalues of truncated random orthogonal matrices; see this paper , especially equation (7.1). Some partial results below. For $\ell=1$ , the integral $\theta(1)$ is solvable by expanding the $\log$ and its value is $$\theta(1) = \frac{3}{16}.$$ Note that for $b\in\mathbb{R}$ , $$ \left|\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2}+bi\right)\right|^2  = \frac{\pi}{\cosh \pi b} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \left|\Gamma\left(1+bi\right)\right|^2 = \frac{\pi b}{\sinh \pi b}, $$ or more generally for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $$\begin{align} \left|\Gamma\left(1+n+bi\right)\right|^2 & = \frac{\pi b}{\sinh \pi b} \prod_{k=1}^n \left(k^2 + b^2 \right)\\ \left|\Gamma\left(\tfrac{1}{2} + n+bi\right)\right|^2 & = \frac{\pi}{\cosh \pi b} \prod_{k=1}^n \left(\left( k-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 + b^2 \right) \end{align}$$ (for a derivation, see Wikipedia ). Hence, when expanding the $\log$ the integral turns into the sum of the integral of powers of $\frac{1}{\sinh}$ and $\frac{1}{\cosh}$ times a polynomial. For instance for $\ell=2$ , one has $$2\pi^2\theta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}\int_0^\infty \Bigl(\frac{x}{\sinh x}\Bigr)^n\,dx.$$ The integral $I_n := \int_0^\infty(\frac{x}{\sinh x})^n\,dx$ has recently been asked about here on math.sa . The answers prove a recurrence relation and indicate that $I_n$ is a linear combination of $\zeta(2), \zeta(4), \ldots, \zeta(2⌈n/2⌉)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ , where the coefficients are the ""central factorial numbers"", see this answer .

I can't seem to simplify this any further. Is there a way to proceed with this integral over $\operatorname{E}(k)$? (I have looked through tables of integrals of elliptic integrals, but nothing seems to match.) Or is there another way to simplify the iterated integral, e.g. via a substitution for both $x$ and $y$? For the record, this integral arises when deriving a certain kind of prior distribution for the parameters of a particular probabilistic model. Berger & Bernardo, 1992, ""Ordered Group Reference Priors with Application to the Multinomial Problem"" describe a sort of generalized Jeffreys prior which assumes a specific parameter ordering and grouping. Essentially, the ""conditional Jeffreys prior"" is derived for each group based on a conditional Fisher information matrix (with the parameters earlier in the ordering held constant), which is based on a marginal likelihood function (with parameters later in the ordering integrated out). The integral above appears when deriving such a prior for a bivariate Bernoulli model with a specific parameterization and ordered grouping of parameters. For two binary variables $X$ and $Y$ with joint probability denoted e.g. $p_{11}$, consider the saturated model with three ""odds ratio"" parameters: $$O_X=\left(\frac{p_{10} p_{11}}{p_{00} p_{01}}\right)^{1/4},  O_Y=\left(\frac{p_{01} p_{11}}{p_{00} p_{10}}\right)^{1/4},  O_{XY}=\left(\frac{p_{00} p_{11}}{p_{10} p_{01}}\right)^{1/4}$$ (These are similar to the classic log-linear parameters defined e.g. in Bishop, Fienberg, & Holland, 1975, Discrete Multivariate Analysis, but without the logs. I assume the integral here would also appear for the case with log-linear parameters.) Assuming the ordered grouping: $(\{O_{XY}\},\{O_X,O_Y\})$, the integral above appears as part of the normalizing constant for the conditional prior $p(O_X,O_Y|O_{XY})$. Finding the joint prior $p(O_X,O_Y,O_{XY})$ then involves deriving $p(O_{XY})$ from a marginal likelihood.","Does the following iterated integral have a simple closed-form expression in terms of $z$? $$ I = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sqrt{\frac{1 + x^2 y^2 + x^2 z^2 + y^2 z^2}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x^2 y^2 z^2)^3}} \, dy \, dx $$ where $x \in \mathbb{R^+}$ and $y \in \mathbb{R^+}$. Assume $z \in \mathbb{R^+}$ is a constant. I tried substituting: $$ u = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \frac{y^2(1 + x^2 z^2)-(x^2+z^2)}{y^2(1 + x^2 z^2)+(x^2+z^2)} \right] $$ which simplifies the integral to this: \begin{align} I &= \int_0^\infty \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{1}{x^2+z^2} \operatorname{_2F_1} \left( -\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}; 1; 1{-}\left[ \frac{x^2+z^2}{1+x^2 z^2} \right]^2 \right) \, dx \\ &= \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+z^2} \operatorname{E} \left( \sqrt{1{-}\left[ \frac{x^2+z^2}{1+x^2 z^2} \right]^2} \right) \, dx \end{align} $\operatorname{E}(k)$ here is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind (using elliptic modulus $k$, not the parameter $m=k^2$). I can't seem to simplify this any further. Is there a way to proceed with this integral over $\operatorname{E}(k)$? (I have looked through tables of integrals of elliptic integrals, but nothing seems to match.) Or is there another way to simplify the iterated integral, e.g. via a substitution for both $x$ and $y$? For the record, this integral arises when deriving a certain kind of prior distribution for the parameters of a particular probabilistic model. Berger & Bernardo, 1992, ""Ordered Group Reference Priors with Application to the Multinomial Problem"" describe a sort of generalized Jeffreys prior which assumes a specific parameter ordering and grouping. Essentially, the ""conditional Jeffreys prior"" is derived for each group based on a conditional Fisher information matrix (with the parameters earlier in the ordering held constant), which is based on a marginal likelihood function (with parameters later in the ordering integrated out). The integral above appears when deriving such a prior for a bivariate Bernoulli model with a specific parameterization and ordered grouping of parameters. For two binary variables $X$ and $Y$ with joint probability denoted e.g. $p_{11}$, consider the saturated model with three ""odds ratio"" parameters: $$O_X=\left(\frac{p_{10} p_{11}}{p_{00} p_{01}}\right)^{1/4},  O_Y=\left(\frac{p_{01} p_{11}}{p_{00} p_{10}}\right)^{1/4},  O_{XY}=\left(\frac{p_{00} p_{11}}{p_{10} p_{01}}\right)^{1/4}$$ (These are similar to the classic log-linear parameters defined e.g. in Bishop, Fienberg, & Holland, 1975, Discrete Multivariate Analysis, but without the logs.

Other questions on this site have referenced the proof that the scaling of the error in a MC integration goes as $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations, and does not depend on the dimension $d$ of the domain of integration. On the other hand, the scaling of the error in a uniform sampling integration goes as some power of $N^{-1/d}$. Consequently, for a sufficiently large $d$, one may achieve a desired level of accuracy using a fewer number of function evaluations with a Monte Carlo method than with a uniform numerical quadrature method. The essence of the proof is an invocation of the central limit theorem. I understand the proof on a formal level. However, I have no intuition for why this proof works. It still seems like ""cheating"" to me that by either randomly or quasi-randomly selecting the locations to evaluate the function being integrated, you can achieve a more accurate integration than you would by choosing to evaluate the points in a uniform set of spacings (provided that the dimensionality of the integral is large enough). I have tried to construct an extremely non-rigorous analogy to conducting a statistical survey. One could either poll people at regular distance spacings in a neighborhood, or instead poll the same number of people in completely randomized locations. If there were no correlation between a person's response and the location where that person lives, then I would be able to conclude that my sampling error would be the same using either method. If there were such a correlation after all, then I might bias my results. Is this sort of reasoning at all on the right track to building intuition for the proof? To phrase my question another way, it seems that when performing a high-dimensional integral you gain accuracy by including a variety of length scales in the points where you evaluate the functions.

I'm studying complex variables and the method of calculating improper integrals with residues but I'm struggling a little with the contours. The teacher said that there is no general way to choose the contour, we can be lucky to find it and be able to solve the integral, or we don't solve the integral. And this sounded to me like finding $\delta$'s in proofs of continuity. This is a good example of what I'm trying to find out. Although there's no ""formula"" to find $\delta$ for every function, there are some steps, that when we take we can figure out our $\delta$ in one almost easy way in many cases. What we do is: we bound $|f(x)-f(a)|$ and try to make appear there things like $|x-a|$, $|x+a|$ and $|x|$, because all of those we can bound. After that, we look again, if there are things like $|x|$ and $|x+a|$, we enforce $|x-a|<1$ or something else, just to bound those things again. After that we look again, and we try to figure out what $|x-a|$ should be less than in order to make the whole thing less than $\epsilon$. Now, when I've learned about continuity in the beginning of the course the teacher said the same: there's no way, or you have creativity to choose $\delta$ or forget about it. But these are guidelines that helped me in the vast majority of cases, even in $\Bbb C$ and $\Bbb R^n$. So, is there a general method, general guidelines that I can follow to see what contour I should use? Since there can be lots of things to say about it, a reference explaining how to think about this and giving general techniques would be of great help.

I've attempted to calculate an integral by first integrating it by parts and then by substituting. The result I got is not correct though. Can I get a hint about where started to make mistakes? Here are my steps: $$\int \sqrt{x}\cdot\sin\sqrt{x}\,dx$$ Applying integration by parts formula $$\int uv' \, dx = uv - \int u'v \, dx$$ where $u=\sqrt{x}$ , $v'=\sin\sqrt{x}$ , $u'=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}$ and $v=-\cos\sqrt{x}$ , resulting in: $$\int \sqrt{x}\cdot\sin\sqrt{x}\,dx = \sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} - \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} \, dx$$ Next, I tried substituting $x$ with $g(t)=t^2$ in the remaining integral, i. e. replacing each $x$ in the integral with $t^2$ and the ending $dx$ with $g'(t)=2t\,dt$ . I would later bring back the $x$ by substituting $t=\sqrt{x}$ after integration. Continuing from where we left by substituting: $$\sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} - \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} \, dx$$ $$\Longrightarrow \sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} - \int \frac{1}{2\sqrt{t^2}} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{t^2}\cdot2t \, dt$$ Then I pulled out the constant multipliers from the integral: $$\sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} - \frac{1}{2} \cdot -1 \cdot 2 \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{t^2}} \cdot \cos\sqrt{t^2}\cdot t \, dt$$ which turned out to eliminate each other (resulting in just $\cdot1$ ), so we end up with: $$\sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} \cdot \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{t^2}} \cdot \cos\sqrt{t^2}\cdot t \, dt$$ Reducing the integrand by reducing $\frac{1}{\sqrt{t^2}}\Rightarrow\frac{1}{t}$ , which again is eliminated by multiplying with the integrand's $t$ , and reducing $\cos\sqrt{t^2}\Rightarrow\cos t$ . Therefore resulting in: $$\sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} \cdot \int \cos t \, dt$$ where the integral can be solved as $\int \cos t \, dt = \sin t + C$ . So now we are at: $$\sqrt{x} \cdot -\cos\sqrt{x} \cdot \sin t + C$$ The correct answer however is $$\int \sqrt{x} \sin\sqrt{x} \, dx = 4 \sqrt{x} \sin\sqrt{x} - 2 (x - 2) \cos\sqrt{x} + C$$ So something somewhere in my process went horribly wrong.

Here are my steps: Applying integration by parts formula where , , and , resulting in: Next, I tried substituting with in the remaining integral, i. e. replacing each in the integral with and the ending with . I would later bring back the by substituting after integration. Continuing from where we left by substituting: Then I pulled out the constant multipliers from the integral: which turned out to eliminate each other (resulting in just ), so we end up with: Reducing the integrand by reducing , which again is eliminated by multiplying with the integrand's , and reducing . Therefore resulting in: where the integral can be solved as . So now we are at: The correct answer however is So something somewhere in my process went horribly wrong.

I'd like to compute the volume of the region that results once the plane sections the cube (above the plane). There are three cases to analyze, and I can't quite visualize one of them. Case 1: $0 \le \alpha < 1$ In this case, the section looks like a triangle, and the volume of interest is 1 minus the volume of the lower left tetrahedron, i.e., $$V = 1 - \int_0^\alpha \int_0^{\alpha-x} \int_0^{\alpha-x-y} dz\,dy\,dx = 1 - \frac{\alpha^3}{6}.$$ Case 3: $2 < \alpha \le 3$. Here, the section is again a triangle, and the volume of interest is the upper right tetrahedron, i.e., $$V = \int_{\alpha-2}^1 \int_{\alpha-x-1}^1 \int_{\alpha-x-y}^1 dz\,dy\,dx = \frac{(3-\alpha)^3}{6}.$$ Case 2: $1 \le \alpha \le 2$.

94,Double integral over a region,Double integral over a region,,"Given $f(x,y)=\displaystyle\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}$ and $D=\{(x,y) : 0 \leq x \leq 1, x^2 \leq y \leq 2-x^2\}$ i have to solve $\displaystyle\int\displaystyle\int_Df(x,y)dA$. Here's my try: (1) Changing variables $x = \sqrt{v-u}$, $y= v+u$. (1.1) Since $0 \leq x \leq 1$, then $0 \leq v-u \leq 1 \rightarrow u \leq v \leq 1+u$ (1.2) Since $x^2 \leq y \leq 2-x^2$, then $v-u \leq v+u \leq 2-v+u \rightarrow -u \leq u \rightarrow 0\leq u$ and $v \leq 2-v \rightarrow v \leq 1$ (1.3) It seems that now i should integrate over  $S = \{(u,v) : 0\leq u \leq v \leq 1 \}$ (the upper triangle in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ ?), so i may as well put $S = \{(u,v) : 0 \leq v \leq 1, 0 \leq u \leq v  \}$. (2) Alright, what do i need to calculate the integral? (2.1) First, i should calculate the Jacobian $ \displaystyle\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)} = \left| \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \\ \end{array} \right| = \left| \begin{array}{cc} -\frac{1}{2\sqrt{v-u}} & \frac{1}{2\sqrt{v-u}} \\ 1 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right| = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{v-u}}$ (2.2) Then i have to solve $\displaystyle\int_0^1\displaystyle\int_0^v \frac{v-u}{(v-u)+(v^2+2uv+u^2)}\bigg(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{v-u}} \bigg)dvdu$ $=-\displaystyle\int_0^1\displaystyle\int_0^v \frac{\sqrt{v-u}}{v^2+v(1+2u) + (u^2-u) }dvdu$ (2.3) Well, here i'm stuck.I've been thinking about taking $z = \sqrt{v-u}$ and then $dz = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2\sqrt{v-u}}dv$ wich means $dv = 2zdz$, this would lead to an integral of the form $2\displaystyle\int\displaystyle\int \frac{z^2}{z^2+z(1+4u)+ 4u^2 }dvdu = 2\displaystyle\int\displaystyle\int \frac{z^2}{(z+(\frac{1}{2}+2u))^2-2u }dvdu$ and if i put $w = z+(\frac{1}{2}+2u)$ i'll have $2\displaystyle\int\displaystyle\int \frac{(w-\frac{1}{2}-2u)^2}{w^2-2u }dwdu$ but it seems that the last one will lead to some ugly shaped solution and i would have a hard time getting the final answer.
