Two colleagues feel certain of a certain approach, and I am befuddled. The approach shapes the results how they want (i.e., brings possibly extreme results toward a notional center line) but I'm not convinced it is mathematically cogent. For background, we are analyzing the performance of loans we provide. We define $purchase\ price$ as the money we lend, $purchase\ amount$ is the total we expect to be paid back, $revenue$ to be the difference of $purchase\ price$ and $purchase\ amount$, and $margin$ to be $revenue - commissions$. For the sake of simplification, let us assume that there are no commissions, such that $revenue \equiv margin$. We say that the $default\ rate$ as a percentage of margin is as follows, with $defaults$ being $anticipated\ margin - actual\ margin$: $$default\ rate = 1 - \frac{actual\ margin}{anticipated\ margin} = \frac{defaults}{anticipated\ margin}$$ During the underwriting and quoting phase, we collect all the expected information and generate a couple of risk scores, and then a human makes qualitative judgements of the risk of the customer and of the loan. This risk is captured by the margin we charge and the time length of the repayment schedule. Riskier loans will skew higher in margin or (not XOR) shorter term length, less risky loans lower in margin or longer in term length. We want to evaluate the performance of various classes of historical loans to decide if we properly priced against the resultant behavior of that business. That is, we want to decide if we adequately priced for risk. We do this by calculating the default rate for one class of business (e.g., from a particular industry or from certain partner sales offices) and comparing it to some benchmark default rate. We want to normalize the default rates to equivalent units. It may be that one segment of the business hit a 30% default rate and another 20%, but unless we can reflect our anticipated risk on these segments and adjust the rates for comparability, we're concerned our analysis will be flawed. This is where my colleagues' notion arrives. They feel it appropriate to ""normalize"" by calculating margin per month as $$margin\ per\ month = \frac{margin}{term\ length}$$ and taking the mean across all the business as average margin per month $$average\ margin\ per\ month = \frac{\sum{margins}}{\sum{term\ lengths}}$$ to be a benchmark. With this, they will calculate a (purportedly) normalized default rate as $$normalized\ default\ rate = default\ rate \times \frac{average\ margin\ per\ month}{margin\ per\ month}$$ They seemed so sure that this gave them the ""normalization"" they wanted that I assumed my befuddlement was due to my being slow. I algebraically expanded their target formula and arrived at something that didn't make much sense: $$\frac{defaults}{margin^2} \times \frac{(\sum{margins}) \times term}{\sum{term\ lengths}}$$ There a couple of ways to rewrite that but they seem equivalently unuseful. My fundamental point of contention is not with the effort of normalization, but the method. Here, we pit the default rate for a class of business against the mean margin/month across all business divided by the margin/month for that class of business. They are right that this corrals the values some, e.g., a lower-than-average risk loan will have lower-than-average anticipated margin, and so its default rate in this analysis will actually be increased . Similarly, the actual default rate for high-risk loans will be decreased . If we expect a class of customer to be inherently riskier, we will price with a proportionately higher margin/month than a class of customer with ""average"" risk, so achieving a higher-than-average actual default rate for that class of customer doesn't itself worry us.

I'm wondering whether there is a mistake in any step I'm making. The background is that $f(x,y)$ is an image that is superimposed with some gaussian noise $n\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. This image is shifted by a true but unknown offset $d_x$ and $d_y$ and the goal is to find an estimate $(\Delta x,\Delta y)^\mathsf{T}$ for this offset and to estimate its variance. This leads to the following expression that is to be minimized: $$ e(\Delta x,\Delta y) = \iint \left(f(x-d_x+\Delta x+\lambda, y-d_y+\Delta y+\eta) - f(x+\lambda,y+\eta) + n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta) - n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\right)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta $$ I am computing the second order taylor expansion around $d_x=\Delta x$ and $d_y=\Delta y$. This yields $$ a(\Delta x - d_x)^2 + b(\Delta y - d_y)^2 +\\ c(\Delta x - d_x)(\Delta y - d_y) + d(\Delta x - d_x) + e(\Delta y - d_y) + f $$ where \begin{eqnarray*} a \approx \iint f_{xx}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ b \approx \iint f_{yy}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ c \approx \iint 2 f_{x}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_y(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ d = \iint 2(n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_x(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ e = \iint 2(n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_y(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ f = \iint (n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2 \text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta \end{eqnarray*} Subscripts denote partial derivatives. The second order partial derivative terms  have been omitted in the formula above. This is the only step I don't feel very comfortable with, but it is also done in the original, univariate proof. Note that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and only $d$, $e$ and $f$ are random variables.

Thank you very much!","I've been trying to extend a proof I have for a univariate function $f(x)$ to a multivariate function $f(x,y)$ but the result I get looks weird. I'm wondering whether there is a mistake in any step I'm making. The background is that $f(x,y)$ is an image that is superimposed with some gaussian noise $n\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. This image is shifted by a true but unknown offset $d_x$ and $d_y$ and the goal is to find an estimate $(\Delta x,\Delta y)^\mathsf{T}$ for this offset and to estimate its variance. This leads to the following expression that is to be minimized: $$ e(\Delta x,\Delta y) = \iint \left(f(x-d_x+\Delta x+\lambda, y-d_y+\Delta y+\eta) - f(x+\lambda,y+\eta) + n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta) - n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\right)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta $$ I am computing the second order taylor expansion around $d_x=\Delta x$ and $d_y=\Delta y$. This yields $$ a(\Delta x - d_x)^2 + b(\Delta y - d_y)^2 +\\ c(\Delta x - d_x)(\Delta y - d_y) + d(\Delta x - d_x) + e(\Delta y - d_y) + f $$ where \begin{eqnarray*} a \approx \iint f_{xx}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ b \approx \iint f_{yy}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ c \approx \iint 2 f_{x}(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_y(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ d = \iint 2(n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_x(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ e = \iint 2(n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)f_y(x+\lambda,y+\eta)\text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta\\ f = \iint (n_1(x+\lambda,y+\eta)-n_0(x+\lambda,y+\eta)^2 \text{d}\lambda\text{d}\eta \end{eqnarray*} Subscripts denote partial derivatives. The second order partial derivative terms  have been omitted in the formula above. This is the only step I don't feel very comfortable with, but it is also done in the original, univariate proof. Note that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and only $d$, $e$ and $f$ are random variables.

If I write as follows: $$\text{var}[\boldsymbol{y}] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}-\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}})^2= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}-\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}})^\top(\boldsymbol{x}_n^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}-\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}^\top \hat{\boldsymbol{u}})= \hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top\mathbf{S}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}},$$ $$\mathbf{S}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}} )(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}})^\top.$$ And then, with Lagrange multiplier over the constrain $\left \| \hat{\boldsymbol{u}} \right \|^2=1$, I get $$\mathbf{S}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}=\lambda\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}.$$ If I write instead the variance in the following way, everything collapse... $$\text{var}[\boldsymbol{y}] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \boldsymbol{x}_n-\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \bar{\boldsymbol{x}})^2= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \boldsymbol{x}_n-\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \bar{\boldsymbol{x}})^\top (\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \boldsymbol{x}_n-\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top \bar{\boldsymbol{x}})=\\ =\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}})^\top\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}\hat{\boldsymbol{u}}^\top(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}) \color{red}{\cancel{\color{black}{=}}} \require{cancel} \color{red}{\cancel{\color{black}{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}})^\top(\boldsymbol{x}_n -\bar{\boldsymbol{x}})= \text{var}[\boldsymbol{x}] }}}$$ Does anyone understand what is going on here? o.O",,"['statistics', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

Answer: $E(Y)=e^\frac{19}{2}$ and $V(Y)=e^{22}(e^{16}-1)$ Part B: Find an interval in which at least 75% of the grain weights should lie. Answer: (0, $e^\frac{19}{2}+2e^{11}(e^{16}-1)^{1/2}$) Part C: Find the probability that a randomly chosen grain weighs less than the mean grain weight. I am unsure what to do for this part. Can someone sketch the procedures for me? As of 12/28/13 there still instead an answer to this question.",,"['statistics', 'normal-distribution']"

By making a Venn-diagram I figured out that the lower boundary should probably be $0.25$, as this is $0.4+0.5+0.6-1=0.5$ (which is everything that should be in some intersection because the total probability cannot be greater than one) devided by $2$ (because the $0.5$ can be split over two intersections). However, I am not sure how to show this using the axioms provided. Could anyone please help? (b) I think I will need the result from a. I am however not at all sure yet what I should do to solve this question. Any help would be appreciated.","For three events $A, B, C$ we know that $P(A\cap B) = 0.4, P(A \cap C)=0.5 \text{ and } P(B\cap C)=0.6$ (a) Derive which values $P(A\cap B \cap C)$ can take, with a clear explanation. Show in every step which axiom you use. You can only make use of the following axioms: $P(A)\geq 0$ $P(S)=1$ $P(A_1\cup A_2 \cup \dots)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty A_i, \text{ } \forall i\neq j$ (b) Let $D=(A\cap B^c \cap C^c) \cup (A^c\cap B \cap C^c) \cup (A^c\cap B^c \cap C)$.
