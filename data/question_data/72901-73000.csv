I'm trying to prove the intuitively obvious claim that $\pi|_Y : Y \to \pi(Y)$ is a homeomorphism, where $\pi : (X \times I) \sqcup Y \to M_f$ is the quotient map. Here are my thoughts: Clearly the map is continuous and a bijection onto its image, so we just need to show that it's open. For any $U \subset Y$ open, we know that $f^{-1}(U) \subset X$ is open since $f$ is continuous. Then $f^{-1}(U) \times I$ is open in $X \times I$ which implies that $V := (f^{-1}(U) \times I) \cup U$ is open in $(X\times I) \sqcup Y$ . $V$ is also saturated with respect to the quotient map $\pi$ , so $\pi(V)$ is open in $M_f$ .

67,Pseudocomplete spaces,Pseudocomplete spaces,,"It is well-known that both locally compact Hausdorff spaces and completely metrizable spaces are Baire (i.e. satisfiy the Baire category theorem). A common generalization of both classes while still being Baire is the class of Čech-complete spaces. A finite product of Baire spaces does not have to be Baire; any product of Čech-complete spaces is Baire but not necessarily Čech-complete. In 1960 Oxtoby defined the class of pseudocomplete spaces. This is a nice property that captures the idea of the proof of the Baire category theorem. It is easy to see that every Čech-complete space is pseudocomplete, that every pseudocomplete space is Baire, and that every product of pseudocomplete spaces is pseudocomplete. In the proof of the last fact there is a small issue for me, but first the definitions: A topological space is quasiregular if every nonempty open set contains the closure of a nonempty open set. A family of nonempty open sets $\mathcal{B}$ is called a π-base (or pseudobase , but this name collides with the notion of pseudobase related to pseudocharacter ) if every nonempty open set contains a member of $\mathcal{B}$ . A topological space is pseudocomplete if it is quasiregular and there exist a sequence $\{\mathcal{B}_n: n ∈ ω\}$ of π-bases such that every sequence $B_0 ⊇ \overline{B_1} ⊇ B_1 ⊇ \overline{B_2} ⊇ B_2 ⊇ \cdots$ such that each $B_n ∈ \mathcal{B}_n$ has nonempty intersection. In the proof of the productivity of pseudocomplete spaces it is needed that even sequences $B_{n_0} ⊇ \overline{B_{n_0 + 1}} ⊇ B_{n_0 + 1} ⊇ \overline{B_{n_0 + 2}} ⊇ B_{n_0 + 2} ⊇ \cdots$ where $B_n ∈ \mathcal{B}_n$ for $n ≥ n_0$ have nonempty intersection (i.e. we may start later in the sequence of $π$ -bases). Oxtoby says that we may assume that $X$ is in every $\mathcal{B}_n$ , but I do not see why it is the case. It seems that simply adding $X$ to the π-bases may destroy the property of the sequence. On the other hand, what seems to work is to remove some members of the π-bases. Namely, we put $\mathcal{B}'_0 := \mathcal{B}_0$ and $\mathcal{B}'_{n + 1} := \{B ∈ \mathcal{B}_{n + 1}: ∃C ∈ \mathcal{B}'_n: \overline{B} ⊆ C\}$ .

This modified sequence satisfies the property we need and we may even add $X$ to these π-bases (unless $X = ∅$ ). But the argument seems to be nontrivial for a comment like “we may assume that $X ∈ \mathcal{B}_n$ ”. So I wonder, am I missing something? Updated: Let me give a concrete example of the situation. Let's write $U \prec V$ for $\overline{U} ⊆ V$ .

The sequence $\mathcal{B}_0, \mathcal{B}'_1, \mathcal{B}'_2, …$ still witnesses that $(0, 1)$ is pseudocomplete since every compatible $\prec$ -decreasing sequence $\{B_n: n ∈ ω\}$ is in fact compactible with the original system $\{\mathcal{B}_n: n ∈ ω\}$ : if $B_{n + 1} = A_{n + 1}$ , then $B_n = A_n$ since $A_n$ is the only member of $B'_n$ containing $A_{n + 1}$ , but $A_0 = X ∉ \mathcal{B}_0$ . On the other hand, if we add $X$ to $\mathcal{B}_0$ , i.e. if we consider the system $\{\mathcal{B}'_n: n ∈ ω\}$ , then we have the compatible sequence $A_0 \succ A_1 \succ A_2 \succ \cdots$ with empty intersection.","It is well-known that both locally compact Hausdorff spaces and completely metrizable spaces are Baire (i.e. satisfiy the Baire category theorem).

I would like to exhibit an increasing sequence of compact connected subsets of $D$ converging to $D$. For example, for a ball we might take a sequence of closed ball inside it of radius $r-\frac 1n$. User SteamyRoot showed that the usual closed exhaustion that generalizes the above example, given by $D_n = \{ x\in D: \mathrm{dist}(x, \partial D) \geq \frac 1n \}$ is not always connected (by considering the shape of eye-glasses), even before modifying it to be bounded. Considering an infinite sequence of glasses connected to one another in a row that are smaller and smaller shows that this will not be connected no matter how small we choose $n$. We also cannot do this by taking the union of all closed squares of side length $2^{-n}$ contained entirely within $D$. This is again not connected because of the same counterexample (infinite glasses), even though this example does have such an exhaustion.","Let $D \subset \Bbb R^n$ be an open connected set.

Moreover, it can be shown that if $C$ is a simple closed curve, then $C$ is homeomorphic to the circle $S^1$. (All using the subspace topology of the standard Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R^n}$ for both, that is.) So suppose a curve $C$ is not simple, so that it has at least one point of self intersection. That is, if $C$ is identified as the image of a continuous function $f: S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ from the circle to the plane, then there is at least one point $p\in S^1$ at which $f$ fails to be injective. In this case, can $C$ still be homeomorphic to a circle? My hunch is that it can not be, and here's what I've come up with so far: Towards a direct proof, I think that if $q = f(p)$ is such a point of self-intersection on the curve $C$, then the inverse function $f^{-1}$ may fail to be continuous at $q$. Intuitively, it seems like neighborhoods around this point will always contain points from at least two ""branches"" of $C$, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Using other topological invariants seemed promising - I think deleting the point $q$ breaks $C$ into at least two connected components while deleting its preimage $p$ leaves the circle in one connected component.
