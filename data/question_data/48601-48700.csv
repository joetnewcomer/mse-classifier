17,Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for Integrals for any two functions clarification,Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for Integrals for any two functions clarification,,"I'm trying to work through a homework set, and it states that for any two functions, $f$ and $g$, that the following inequality holds: $$ \int{fg} \le ||f|| \cdot ||g|| \le \frac{c}{2}||f||^2 + \frac{1}{2c}||g||^2 $$ I am confused as to how to actually utilize this inequality.  First, what does it mean to say that the integral of a product of two functions is less than a weighted sum of the squares of their individual 2-norms?

67,"“Most intuitive” average of $P$ for all $x\in A \cap [a,b]$, where $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}$?","“Most intuitive” average of  for all , where ?","P x\in A \cap [a,b] A\subseteq\mathbb{R}","Consider $P:A\to\mathbb{R}$ where $P(x)> 0 \text{,} \ $ $A$ is an  subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $$P(x)= \begin{cases} P_1(x) & x \in A_1\\ P_2(x) & x \in A_2\\ \end{cases}$$ where $A=A_1\cup A_2$ and $A_1,A_2$ are pairwise disjoint. What is the ""most intuitive"" average of $P(x)$ , for all $x \in A\cap[a,b]$ , that is unique and where $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ ? Note “unique” means a system that produces a single average, instead of multiple averages, using reasoning/intuition. Also note this question is subjective but there are areas of math (such as measure theory) that is  based on intuitions/ intuitive properties. For example, we can pick any arbitrary measure to find the average of Dirichlet's Function in $[0,1]$ , but instead, we use the Lebesgue measure. Why is the Lebesgue measure intuitive? Because if real numbers in $[a,b]$ are written as infinite, randomly generated digits; there is zero probability they will represent a number in $[a,b]$ . Moreover, there is zero probability that finite, randomly generated digits will repeat infinitely to give rational numbers; hence, these digits have a probability $1$ of being irrational.  Say we multiplied these intuitive probabilities times $b-a$ . This gives the results of the Lebesgue measure. Hence we can state the Lebesgue measure is intuitive for these cases? However, if we are focusing on countable $A\cap[a,b]$ , it should still have a measure of one and the average of $P$ should exist between the infimum and supermum of its range. The problem is most countably additive measures of $A\cap[a,b]$ is zero giving $P$ an average outside the range. What measure should we use instead? What do you think are intuitive properties/examples that the average should follow? Here are two examples, I believe our measure and average should match If $A$ has a Lebesgue measure of one the average of $P$ should intuitively be $$\int_{\mu(A_1\cap[a,b])}P_1(x)dx+\int_{\mu(A_2\cap[a,b])}P_2(x)dx$$ Where $\mu$ is a measure that equals the Lebesgue measure (when the Lebesgue measure of $A$ is one). Even better, we could use the Gauge Integral , which is far more general and doesn't use a measure. However, even the Gauge integral gives the average of $P$ zero, when defined on a domain with zero Lebesgue measure. Here are two cases that the average of $P$ , where the Lebesgue measure of $A\cap[a,b]$ is zero, should intuitively follow. If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite in $[a,b]$ , the average of $P$ is $$\frac{\sum\limits_{i\in A\cap[a,b]}P(i)}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}+\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}+\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ And probability measure $\mu(X\cap[a,b])$ for $X\subseteq A$ is $$\mathbf{W_1}=\mu(A_1\cap[a,b])=\frac{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W_2}=\mu(A_2\cap[a,b])=\frac{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|A\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W}_1\sum\limits_{i_1\in A_1\cap[a,b]}P(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap[a,b]\right|}+\mathbf{W}_2\sum\limits_{i_2\in A_2\cap[a,b]}P(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ If $A_1$ is countable infinite in $[a,b]$ and $A_2$ is finite, since $A\cap[a,b]$ is countably infinite, if $\mathbf{J}_m$ contains all finite subsets of $A\cap[a,b]$ where $\max\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}|\mathbf{J}_m|=\left|\mathbf{I}_n\right|\le n$ ; $\mathbf{I}_n$ is arranged as $\left\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\right\}$ where $a\le a_1<a_2<...<a_n\le b$ , and $$ \max_{i\le n,i\in\mathbb{N}}\left(\text{diff} (\mathbf{I_n})\right)=\max_{i\le n,i\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,...,a_n-a_{n-1}\right\}\le K(n)$$ such that $K:S\to\mathbb{R}$ , $\mu(S)=1$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}K(n)=\inf\text{diff}(A)$ ; then the measures $W_1$ and $W_2$ are $$\mathbf{W}_{1}=\mathbf{\mu}(A_1\cap[a,b])=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\left|A_1\cap \mathbf{I}_n\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|\mathbf{I}_{n}\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ $$\mathbf{W}_{2}=\mathbf{\mu}(A_2\cap[a,b])=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\left|A_2\cap \mathbf{I}_n\cap[a,b]\right|}{\left|\mathbf{I}_{n}\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ And $\text{avg}(P)$ is $$\mathbf{W}_{1}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i_1\in A_1 \cap I_n \cap [a,b]}P_1(i_1)\frac{1}{\left|A_1\cap I_n\cap[a,b]\right|}+\mathbf{W}_{2}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i_2\in A_2 \cap I_n \cap [a,b]}P_2(i_2)\frac{1}{\left|A_2\cap I_n\cap[a,b]\right|}$$ Any $\mathbf{I}_n$ gives the same answer but I'm not sure how to prove this. Moreover, if $A$ is dense in $[a,b]$ , $$\text{avg}(P)=\frac{1}{b-a}\mathbf{W}_1\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx+\frac{1}{b-a}\mathbf{W}_2\int_{a}^{b}P_2(x) \ dx=\frac{1}{b-a}(1)\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx+\frac{1}{b-a}(0)\int_{a}^{b}P_2(x) \ dx$$ $$\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}P_1(x) \ dx$$ Here's the proof. Since $A$ is dense in $[a,b]$ , it can approximate arbitrarily close to any point in $\mathbb{R}$ . Hence it's possible for the limits outside the domain to exist. We extend $P:A\to\mathbb{R}$ to $P:A \cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ where for $c\in \mathbb{R}\setminus A$ $$C=\left\{P^{-1}\left(\lim_{\left\{ x\in A\right\}\to c}P(x)\right) \right\}$$ Since $A_1$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ , $P:A\cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ can be split into $P_1:A_1\cup C\to\mathbb{R}$ and $P_2:A_2\to\mathbb{R}$ . Since $A_2$ is the discontinuties of $P:A\cup C \to \mathbb{R}$ and the Lebesgue measure of $A_2$ is zero, the Lebesgue criteria for reimman integration states the riemman integral for $P_1:A_1\cup C \to \mathbb{R}$ can exist. Hence we apply the mean value theorem of integration on $P_1$ . If $A_1$ and $A_2$ is dense in $[a,b]$ the average is unclear. For one, we could set $\mathbf{I}_n$ to equal subsets of $A_1$ , $A_2$ or $A_1\cup A_2$ . In this case, $\mathbf{W}_1$ or $\mathbf{W}_2$ could equal anything I will post my intuition for this example. If you have a measure that matches these intuitions, post it below.","Consider where is an  subset of and where and are pairwise disjoint.

I know that the next to leading order term is wrong because I know the exact form of this integral in terms of Bessel functions and asymptotics of these are known.","I'd like to ask for hints how to obtain higher order corrections to approximations obtained by the saddle point method. References will be also welcome. Unfortunately what comes up when googling is mostly just usual leading order approximation. Let me show my idea how to do it. Consider an integral $I(t)= \int_{\mathbb R} e^{tx^2 - x^4} dx$. I am interested in the limit $t \to \infty$ through complex values. My idea is to expand quartic in the exponential around its stationary point $x_0$ as $a+b(x-x_0)^2-x^4$ and replace $e^{-x^4}$ by $1-x^4$. The result is that I get correct leading order behaviour, but wrong next to leading order corection for some values of argument of $t$.
