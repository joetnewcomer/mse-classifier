Can anyone help me understand this identity. I have tried letting $m=-a-1$ and then applying the binomial theorem, and letting the sum run up to $\infty$ since anything past $m$ will be $0$. But I didn't get anywhere because we'll still have $(-1)^i$ in the sum. Since there is the $\infty$ in the sum, I have also tried thinking about it in terms of generating functions but can't get anywhere.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

Call the summation variable $n$. Now add into the finite sum extra terms which are $0$ for $n>m$, in order to make it look like an infinite series. What happens to the limit on $m$ outside the series? So far I was able to use Hint 1 to expand the left side: $$ \lim_{m \to \infty} \left( 1 + \frac{x}{m} \right)^m = \lim_{m \to \infty} \sum_{n=0}^m \binom {m}{n} \left( \frac{x}{m} \right)^n $$ No matter what I do with the binomial coefficients and factorials, I can't figure out what extra terms to add per Hint 2.

I hope that the question is clear: you just can't place rooks on squares with coordinates $(1, 1), 2, 2)$ and so on. I will call these squares forbidden. For small board sizes the answer is: 2x2 - 1, 3x3 - 2, 4x4 - 9 (if I haven't made a mistake which I'm not so sure about). This problem is harder than it felt at the first glance. What makes it harder is the fact that after placing a rook on the 1st line and figuring out ways for all the lower lines, these lower lines are not equal: one of them already has forbidden square on a column on which you placed the 1st line rook, so nothing is changed for this line, but for other lines you have lessen the number of vacant places by one. To make it more clear, think of coordinates as index of a matrix element, and say: forbidden squares are $(1, 1), (2, 2), \ldots$ , you place a rook on square $(1, 2)$ , and thus squares $(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), \ldots$ are now closed, but $(2, 2)$ was already closed before that, so nothing changed.

My questions are: Is there some intuition for why the sequential criterion holds in things like Euclidean space or general metric spaces, but not in some other spaces? Does it simply have to do with the fact that we have a metric, and if so, why does the metric “induce” such sequential criteria (versus without a metric we may not)?

So, I've been thinking about the limit of the sequence $\left(\root{2n+1}\of{-1}\right)_{n\geq 0}$ . Since the order of the root is odd for every $n$ , this sequence, is obviously a constant sequence with the general term $a_n = -1$ . So, from this follows that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \root{2n+1}\of{-1} = -1 $$ . We can even do an $\epsilon-N$ proof to show this (and it's realy easy actually): $$ \forall \epsilon > 0 \hspace{0.5cm} \exists N \geq 0 \hspace{0.3cm} \text{s.t.} \hspace{0.3cm} \left|\root{2n+1}\of{-1}+1\right|<\epsilon \hspace{0.5cm} \forall n \geq N \\ \left|\root{2n+1}\of{-1} + 1\right| = \left|-1 + 1\right| = 0 < \epsilon \hspace{0.5cm} \forall n \geq 0 \\ N = 0 \ _\blacksquare $$ . However, if we use tehniques ussualy used for solving limits, we end up with a different result: $$ \begin{align*}  \lim_{n\to\infty} \root{2n+1}\of{-1} &= \lim_{n\to\infty} (-1)^{1\over 2n+1} \\ &= \left(\lim_{n\to\infty}-1\right)^{\lim_{n\to\infty}{1\over 2n+1}} \\ &= (-1)^0 \\ &= 1 \end{align*} $$ .
