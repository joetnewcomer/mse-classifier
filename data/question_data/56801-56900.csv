Main result Let $$x = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{d_k}{2^k}, \mbox{ with } d_0=0 \tag 1$$ Then, assuming $y_0, z_0$ are positive integers, we have: $y_0=0 \Rightarrow x=0$ $z_0 = 2y_0 \Rightarrow x=\frac{1}{2}$ $z_0 < y_0 \Rightarrow x=1$ In all other cases (referred to as the standard case ), $x$ is an irrational quadratic number solution of $2x^2 +(z_0-1)x -y_0=0$ , more specifically: $$x =\frac{-(z_0-1)+\sqrt{(z_0-1)^2+8y_0}}{4} \tag 2$$ My question Can you prove the above result? It was obtained empirically. 2. Useful tips to answer my question In the standard case, we have the following result (not proved yet): $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{z_n}{2^n}=\sqrt{(z_0-1)^2 + 8y_0}.$$ Also, using $u_n=2y_n-z_n$ and $v_n = 2z_n+3$ , the recurrence can be rewritten as: If $u_n>0$ Then $u_{n+1}=4u_n -v_n$ $v_{n+1} = 2v_n + 3$ $d_{n+1}=1$ Else $u_{n+1}=4u_n + v_n-2$ $v_{n+1} = 2v_n-5$ $d_{n+1}=0$ Finally, $\mbox{mod}(v_n, 8) = 5$ , that is, $(v_n - 5)/8$ is an integer. If $n>1$ we have: $$d_n = \mbox{ mod}\Big(\frac{v_n-5}{8},2\Big).$$ This leads to the following simple reverse recurrence involving only one variable, allowing you to compute the digits of $x$ backward, starting with a large $n$ and moving backward down to $n=1$ : $$\mbox{If mod}\Big(\frac{v_{n}-5}{8}, 2\Big) = 1, \mbox{ then } v_{n-1}=\frac{v_{n}-3}{2}, d_{n}=1, \mbox{ else } v_{n-1}=\frac{v_{n}+5}{2}, d_{n} = 0.$$ The very tough problem, outlined in the next section, is to prove that each of these two outcomes is equally likely to occur, on average. This would indeed be true if each $v_n$ is arbitrary, but this is not the case here. Also, if for some large $n$ , we have $d_n=1$ , then a run of $R$ successive digits $d_{n-1},\dots,d_{n-R}$ all equal to zero can only go so far, unless $v_n$ is a very special number not leading to $x$ being irrational. Maybe $R=\lfloor 2\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ is an upper bound. This is something worth exploring. Property of the reverse recurrence : If $\mbox{mod}(v_n,8)=5$ and $v_n > 5$ , then the sequence $v_n, v_{n-1},\dots$ is strictly decreasing until it reaches $5$ and stays there permanently; also each term is congruent to $5$ modulo $8$ . This is true whether or not $v_n$ was generated using our forward recurrence. An interesting application of this property is as follows. Take an arbitrary number, say $x = \log 2$ . Multiply by a large power of $2$ , say $2^{30}$ . Round the result to the closest integer congruent to $5$ modulo $8$ , and let this be your $v_n$ . In this case, $v_n =\lfloor 2^{30} \log 2 \rfloor$ . Compute $v_{n-1}, v_{n-2}$ and so on, as well as the associated digits, using the reverse recurrence. Stop when you hit $5$ . The digits in question are the first binary digits of $\log 2$ yielding the approximation $0.693147175\dots$ while the exact value is $0.693147180\dots$ A similar reverse recurrence is also available for the original system:   If $\mbox{mod}(\frac{z_{n}-1}{4}, 2) = 1$ , then $z_{n-1}=\frac{z_{n}-3}{2}$ , $d_{n}=1$ , else $z_{n-1}=\frac{z_{n}+1}{2}$ , $d_{n} = 0$ . We also have $\mbox{mod}(z_n,4)=1$ . 3. Connection to normality of irrational quadratic numbers This is not part of my question, just interesting, extra material for the curious reader, and to provide some background as to why I am interested in this recursion. Do not even try to solve my problem below: contrarily to the main result, this stuff is incredibly hard; it could keep you busy and depressed for many years. Let $S_n$ denotes the number of binary digits $d_k$ of $x$ , that are equal to 1, for $k=1,\cdots, n$ . If irrational quadratic numbers were indeed normal as we all believe they are, then, there is an absolute constant $K$ (not depending on $x$ ), and for each $x$ , there is a number $N(x)$ denoted as $N$ , such that $$\mbox{If } n > N, \mbox{ then } S_n - K\sqrt{n} \leq \frac{n}{2} \leq S_n + K\sqrt{n}  \tag 3$$ This is a consequence of the Berry-Hessen theorem applied to Bernouilli variables. It is discussed in sections 1.1 and 1.2 in this article . The chart below shows $\frac{|2S_n - n|}{\sqrt{n}}$ on the Y-axis, with $n$ between 0 and 530,000 on the X-axis, for the case $y_0 = z_0 = 1$ leading to $x=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . It suggests (not a proof) that in this case, $N = 0$ and $K = 0.90$ might work. To prove that $x$ has 50% of its binary digits equal to 1, a potential approach thus consists in proving that if the previous inequality is true for $n$ large enough, then it is also true for $n+1$ , by looking at the worst case scenario for the potential distribution of the first $n$ binary digits of $x$ , using the recurrence relation introduced at the beginning, or the backward recurrence. Some of the numbers $x$ that I tested are approaching the 50% ratio in question rather slowly, for instance if $y_0=1, z_0=16$ . Indeed, I am wondering if some of these quadratic irrationals, maybe a finite number of them, even though normal, do not satistfy $(3)$ , but instead a weaker result, say with $\sqrt{n}$ replaced by $n^{3/4}$ or $\frac{n}{\log n}$ . To the contrary, a very fast convergence, say $n^{1/4}$ or $\log n$ instead of $\sqrt{n}$ in $(3)$ , would also mean, even though $x$ may be normal, that its digits are not distributed like i.i.d. Bernouilli $(\frac{1}{2})$ variables. The only way for this Bernouilli behavior to happen, is if the convergence to the 50% ratio occurs at the right speed, that is with $\sqrt{n}$ in inequality $(3)$ . In other words, for a specific $x$ , any asymptotic departure from $\sqrt{n}$ in $(3)$ would mean that its binary digits are not distributed in a purely random way. This ""pure randomness"" criterion is stronger than having 50% of the digits equal to 1. For instance, $x=\frac{2}{3}=0.10101010\dots$ (in base 2) has 50% of its digits equal to 1, but the term $O(\sqrt{n})$ in $(3)$ can be replaced by the optimum bound $O(1)$ , and the digits look anything but random. I am doing some simulations and testing at this moment, see for instance my recent question on CrossValidated, here . Another spectacular result that might be more easier to prove is that the correlation between the binary digits of $px$ and $qx$ is equal to $\frac{1}{pq}$ if $p, q$ are odd, co-prime, non-zero integers: see here . A corollary is that if $\alpha,\beta$ are irrationals linearly independent over the set of rational numbers, then their binary digits have zero cross-correlation.","Update on 3/2/2020 .

Main result Let Then, assuming are positive integers, we have: In all other cases (referred to as the standard case ), is an irrational quadratic number solution of , more specifically: My question Can you prove the above result? It was obtained empirically. 2. Useful tips to answer my question In the standard case, we have the following result (not proved yet): Also, using and , the recurrence can be rewritten as: If Then Else Finally, , that is, is an integer. If we have: This leads to the following simple reverse recurrence involving only one variable, allowing you to compute the digits of backward, starting with a large and moving backward down to : The very tough problem, outlined in the next section, is to prove that each of these two outcomes is equally likely to occur, on average. This would indeed be true if each is arbitrary, but this is not the case here. Also, if for some large , we have , then a run of successive digits all equal to zero can only go so far, unless is a very special number not leading to being irrational. Maybe is an upper bound. This is something worth exploring. Property of the reverse recurrence : If and , then the sequence is strictly decreasing until it reaches and stays there permanently; also each term is congruent to modulo . This is true whether or not was generated using our forward recurrence. An interesting application of this property is as follows. Take an arbitrary number, say . Multiply by a large power of , say . Round the result to the closest integer congruent to modulo , and let this be your . In this case, . Compute and so on, as well as the associated digits, using the reverse recurrence. Stop when you hit . The digits in question are the first binary digits of yielding the approximation while the exact value is A similar reverse recurrence is also available for the original system:   If , then , , else , . We also have . 3. Connection to normality of irrational quadratic numbers This is not part of my question, just interesting, extra material for the curious reader, and to provide some background as to why I am interested in this recursion. Do not even try to solve my problem below: contrarily to the main result, this stuff is incredibly hard; it could keep you busy and depressed for many years. Let denotes the number of binary digits of , that are equal to 1, for . If irrational quadratic numbers were indeed normal as we all believe they are, then, there is an absolute constant (not depending on ), and for each , there is a number denoted as , such that This is a consequence of the Berry-Hessen theorem applied to Bernouilli variables. It is discussed in sections 1.1 and 1.2 in this article . The chart below shows on the Y-axis, with between 0 and 530,000 on the X-axis, for the case leading to . It suggests (not a proof) that in this case, and might work. To prove that has 50% of its binary digits equal to 1, a potential approach thus consists in proving that if the previous inequality is true for large enough, then it is also true for , by looking at the worst case scenario for the potential distribution of the first binary digits of , using the recurrence relation introduced at the beginning, or the backward recurrence. Some of the numbers that I tested are approaching the 50% ratio in question rather slowly, for instance if . Indeed, I am wondering if some of these quadratic irrationals, maybe a finite number of them, even though normal, do not satistfy , but instead a weaker result, say with replaced by or . To the contrary, a very fast convergence, say or instead of in , would also mean, even though may be normal, that its digits are not distributed like i.i.d. Bernouilli variables. The only way for this Bernouilli behavior to happen, is if the convergence to the 50% ratio occurs at the right speed, that is with in inequality . In other words, for a specific , any asymptotic departure from in would mean that its binary digits are not distributed in a purely random way. This ""pure randomness"" criterion is stronger than having 50% of the digits equal to 1. For instance, (in base 2) has 50% of its digits equal to 1, but the term in can be replaced by the optimum bound , and the digits look anything but random. I am doing some simulations and testing at this moment, see for instance my recent question on CrossValidated, here . Another spectacular result that might be more easier to prove is that the correlation between the binary digits of and is equal to if are odd, co-prime, non-zero integers: see here . A corollary is that if are irrationals linearly independent over the set of rational numbers, then their binary digits have zero cross-correlation.","z_n < 2y_n y_{n+1} = 4y_n - 2z_n z_{n+1} = 2z_n + 3 d_{n+1}=1 y_{n+1} = 4y_n z_{n+1} = 2 z_n - 1 d_{n+1}=0 d_n x y_1=2,z_1=5 x=\sqrt{2} x x y;

I've started with a simpler case assuming . So the sequence becomes: It seems reasonable to use Cauchy Criterion for the sequence. Namely suppose , then we want to show: Lets try to synthetically bound the sum by: By telescoping we obtain: Given and : Applying the limit to one may obtain: So squeezing gives: Which would eventually mean: However I'm not sure how to find the index from which the inequality becomes true since the expression for the upper bound involves a factorial. If we now put : Which doesn't influence the value of the limit. There are three questions in my mind: Is the overall reasoning valid? Is it possible to find a closed form of , such that ?

22,How to find the general term of the following sequence?,How to find the general term of the following sequence?,,"Consider the following recurrence problem: \begin{align} d_{i-1} &= 2\varphi_{i+1}+4\varphi_i + 8d_i-7d_{i+1} - F \left( \delta_{i,N} + \delta_{i,N+1} \right) \, , \\ \varphi_{i-1} &= -7\varphi_{i+1}-16\varphi_{i} + 24 \left( d_{i+1}-d_{i} \right) + F \left( \delta_{i,N} + \delta_{i,N+1} \right) \, ,  \end{align} where $d_i, i \in \{2, \cdots , N+1\}$ represent displacements, $\varphi_i$ inclinations, and $F$ is a known force acting at the nodes $N$ and $N+1$.

Prove that $x_n \downarrow x$ and $y_n \uparrow y$, as $n\to \infty$, for some $x,y \in \mathbb R$. Next, prove $x=y$ and that $3.14155\lt x\lt 3.14161$. (This is why I believe $x=y=\pi$) Edit: I understand that if we can show $x_n$ is decreasing and converging to $x$, and $y_n$ is increasing and converging to $y$, we can recognize the Monotone Convergence Theorem. After which, apply the limit to both equations to get $x$ and $y$. The problem I am having is understanding how we get there, and after we are there, how we show it equals $\pi$.
