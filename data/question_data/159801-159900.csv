0,Magical trigonometric inequality (feat. number theory),Magical trigonometric inequality (feat. number theory),,"A couple of days ago I found an interesting problem on the Art of Problem Solving website. It says: For odd and coprime positive integers $p$ and $q$ , the following inequality holds $$ \sum_{m=1}^{p} \sum_{n=1}^{q} \frac{2}{\cos(\frac{2m\pi}{p})+\cos(\frac{2n\pi}{q})} \le pq(|p-q|+1). $$ The magical thing is that the equality holds for some non-trivial examples, such as $(p,q)=(23,31), (29,31)$ (I have checked via WolframAlpha), while for some other $(p,q)$ the bound is rather loose. This suggests that crude boundings cannot apply, and there might be an identity behind it. The strange equality case also hints at the relation to prime numbers. Pairing $m \leftrightarrow p-m$ and $n \leftrightarrow q-n$ seems plausible, but appears to be of little use. I tried directly compute $\sum_{n=1}^{q} \frac{2}{\cos(\frac{2m\pi}{p})+\cos(\frac{2n\pi}{q})}$ for a fixed $m$ , but I find it hard to deal with. Also, the cosine terms may related to eigenvalues of circulant matrices, but I don't know how to interpret $\cos(\frac{2m\pi}{p})+\cos(\frac{2n\pi}{q})$ . Any ideas or comments are welcome. Edit: I numerically compute the values for all odd numbers $p \le q<50$ (without requiring $\gcd(p,q)=1$ ).

2,Finding the first term of a Goodstein sequence whose expression has maximum exponent,Finding the first term of a Goodstein sequence whose expression has maximum exponent,,"Let $n$ be a natural number. When constructing the Goodstein sequence $(n)_{k}$ , we start with $(n)_{1}=n$ written in complete base $2$ , and we proceed recursively. That is, if $(n)_{k}$ has been defined and it is not $0$ , $(n)_{k+1}$ is obtained from $(n)_{k}$ by bumping the base by $1$ in the complete base $k+1$ representation of $(n)_{k}$ and then subtracting $1$ . Now, let $n\ge 4$ and let $2^{m_{1}}+\cdots 2^{m_{r}}$ , with $m_{1}>\cdots >m_{r}\ge 0$ be the standard base $2$ representation of $n$ . As we write down the sequence $(n)_{1}$ , $(n)_{2}$ , etc. we notice that the exponents of the first terms (in bases $2$ , $3$ , etc., respectively) increase up to a certain base, say $b$ , at which point we will have $(n)_{b-1}=(b)^{b}$ . Next, we have $(n)_{b}=b\cdot(b+1)^{b}+\cdots+b\cdot(b+1)+b$ , and the exponents never increase again as we continue the process. That is, for $k\ge b-1$ the exponents of the expression of $(n)_{k}$ are all $\leq b$ . For example, take $n=7=2^{2}+2+1$ . We have $$\begin{array}{c|c}     b & (n)_{b-1}\\     \hline     2 & 2^{2}+2+1\\     3 & 3^{3}+3\\     4 & 4^{4}+3\\     5 & 5^{5}+2\\     6 & 6^{6}+1\\     7 & 7^{7}\\     8 & 8^{8}-1 = 7\cdot 8^{7}+\cdots+7\cdot 8+7\\     \vdots & \vdots\\    \end{array}$$ Thus, for $n=7$ , the exponent reaches its maximum for the first time for base $b=7$ (i.e. for the $6^{th}$ term of the sequence). Up to $n=7$ the base $b$ is easy to find. But for $n=8$ it is a very large number, and things explode for larger values of $n$ (as one would expect). How do we find this $b$ in general?

I assume this is true and may seem to be connected with Goldbach conjecture but clearly should be a lot easier. For instance, if $n\ge 8$ is even, then assuming that Goldbach conjecture is true, $$n-2=p+q\implies\ n=p+1+q+1=\sigma(p)+\sigma(q)$$ for some primes $p$ and $q$ . So, the answer to $\mathcal Q$ would be affirmitive for even $n$ if we assume Goldbach. There seems to be no simple way to do something similar for $n$ odd. The numbers in the range of $\sigma_1(n)$ less than $100$ are $$A=\{ 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 36,  38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 48, 54, 56, 57, 60, 62, 63, 68, 72, 74, 78, 80,  84, 90, 91, 93, 96, 98\}.$$ The list of $a+b$ with $a,b\in A$ , and then sorted is $$2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10,  11, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 15,  15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 17, 17, 17, 17, 18,  18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20, 20, 20,...  20, 20$$ which makes the conjecture that $\mathcal Q$ is true very plausible.

However that problem after the pattern was countered by some people in comments, seemed to have reached a dead end, however I was still wondering whether there are infinitely many solutions , and possibly generalize to more than 5 terms . I just  tried to make cases on the number of negative terms as in the previous problem . Edit: As for the generalization part using n=6 solution mentioned in the linked post[comment section] note and $n=5$ we can compose other solutions for example $\frac{1}{-40k}+\frac{1}{-3k}+\frac{1}{5k}+\frac{1}{8k}+\frac{1}{30k}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{-4}+\frac{1}{-9}+\frac{1}{-10}+\frac{1}{-15}+\frac{1}{36}$ would be a valid construction for $n=11$ under certain infinitely many values of $k$ to make sure no two terms sum to 0. and as we paste another $\frac{1}{-40a}+\frac{1}{-3a}+\frac{1}{5a}+\frac{1}{8a}+\frac{1}{30a}$ and so $\frac{1}{-40a}+\frac{1}{-3a}+\frac{1}{5a}+\frac{1}{8a}+\frac{1}{30a}+\frac{1}{-40k}+\frac{1}{-3k}+\frac{1}{5k}+\frac{1}{8k}+\frac{1}{30k}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{-4}+\frac{1}{-9}+\frac{1}{-10}+\frac{1}{-15}+\frac{1}{36}$ would become valid example for $n=16$ and in general we have construction for $n=5k+1$ we can similarly paste the 6 term solution again and again along with the 5 term solution and get a solution for $n=5a+6b$ by Mc Chicken nugget theorom https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem . All $n \geq 20$ can be written in that form so we now have infinite solutions for them [note again we have restrictions on constants we are multiplying with to make sure no two sum to $0$ [gcd is always obeyed as we can have two coprime terms in the sequence always],but even with that we have infinite]. there are some other ways to compose solutions for $n=31$ using only $n=5$ manually without writing code by which we have examples for $n \geq 120$ using same method. This is the method we know $1+\frac{1}{30}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{-3}+\frac{1}{-40}=1+30+8+5-3-40=1$ Square both sides without grouping that is for example dont write $a+a=2a$ and keep it as $a$ and $a$ and separetely in the new sequence we have $6^2=36$ terms only two terms that will cancel[sum to 0] will be those in pairs of [observe in the expansion we again have sum of integers=sum of reciprocals] of $8*5$ and $-40*1$ , as we didnt group total 4 terms got removed , and no two other terms sum to 0 , also remove the $1^2$ from both sides , u are left with $36-4-1=31$ terms and gcd is 1 as one as $5^2$ and $8^2$ were in expansion and they are coprime. Hope i was clear coz this part was a bit tough for me to write ask on comments for any quiries. Imma also share a list of solutions that got produced when i coded for $n=5$ [the sum of terms being 0 is not a coincidence but forced to make the search program faster] some solutions are permutations of others. Update: Have a proof for  n=9 . Take any tuple $(x, y, z)$ sum of no two terms is 0 of integers none is $1$ or $-1$ . And $x+y+z=0$ . Take another such tuple $(a, b, c)$ We show infinite solutions for when the sum is $0$ . hence it suffices to find infinite rational solutions[which are not just created by multipltying one solution with a constant ] as the equation is homogenous .

However that problem after the pattern was countered by some people in comments, seemed to have reached a dead end, however I was still wondering whether there are infinitely many solutions , and possibly generalize to more than 5 terms . I just  tried to make cases on the number of negative terms as in the previous problem . Edit: As for the generalization part using n=6 solution mentioned in the linked post[comment section] note and we can compose other solutions for example would be a valid construction for under certain infinitely many values of to make sure no two terms sum to 0. and as we paste another and so would become valid example for and in general we have construction for we can similarly paste the 6 term solution again and again along with the 5 term solution and get a solution for by Mc Chicken nugget theorom https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem . All can be written in that form so we now have infinite solutions for them [note again we have restrictions on constants we are multiplying with to make sure no two sum to [gcd is always obeyed as we can have two coprime terms in the sequence always],but even with that we have infinite]. there are some other ways to compose solutions for using only manually without writing code by which we have examples for using same method.

Imma also share a list of solutions that got produced when i coded for [the sum of terms being 0 is not a coincidence but forced to make the search program faster] some solutions are permutations of others.

22,Can we extend the Divisor Function $\sigma_s$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ by extending Ramanujan Sums $c_n$ to $\mathbb{Q}$?,Can we extend the Divisor Function  to  by extending Ramanujan Sums  to ?,\sigma_s \mathbb{Q} c_n \mathbb{Q},"It can be shown that the divisor function $\sigma_s(k)=\sum_{d\vert k} d^s$ defined for $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ can be expressed as a Dirichlet series with the Ramanujan sums $c_n(k):=\sum\limits_{m\in(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times}e^{2\pi i\frac{m}{n}k}$ defined for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ with the following identity $$\boxed{\forall k\in\mathbb{Z}^+:\sigma_s(k)=\zeta(1-s)\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{c_n(k)}{n^{1-s}}}$$ It is easy to show that, since $m\mapsto-m$ is a bijection on $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$ , $c_n(-k)=c_n(k)$ as we only permute the invertible elements. This suggests by looking at the previous Dirichlet series that $\sigma_s(k)$ could be extended to $k\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$ as $\sigma_s(-k)=\sigma(k)$ . This is quite intuitive as it means that $\sigma_s(k)=\sum_{d\vert k}d^s$ runs over the positive divisors $\forall 0\neq k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Notice as well that we could extend $\sigma_s(k)$ to $k=0$ by looking at the previous series as $$\sigma_s(0)=\zeta(1-s)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{c_n(0)}{n^{1-s}}=\zeta(1-s)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\varphi(n)}{n^{1-s}}=\zeta(1-s)\frac{\zeta(-s)}{\zeta(1-s)}=\zeta(-s)$$ This is also intuitive noting that the positive divisors of $0$ are $\{1,2,3,...\}$ so one would informally guess $\sigma_s(0)=1^s+2^s+3^s+...=\zeta(-s)$ . So the previous series let's us expand the domain of $\sigma_s(k)$ to $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . In fact, it can also be shown that this extension is also multiplicative in the sense that if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are coprime then $\sigma_s(n_1 n_2)=\sigma_s(n_1)\sigma_s(n_2)$ . But this is not the end of the story. Coprimality can also be considered in $\mathbb{Q}$ where we say that $x,y\in\mathbb{Q}$ are coprime $\iff \forall p\in\mathbb{P}:\nu_p(x)=0$ or $\nu_p(y)=0$ where $\nu_p$ is the rational $p$ -adic valuation . Then, $\sigma_s(x)$ can be defined for all $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ by defining $\forall p\in\mathbb{P}$ prime and $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}:\sigma_s(p^\alpha)=\frac{1-p^{s(1+\alpha)}}{1-p^s}$ , $\sigma_s(0)=\zeta(-s)$ and allowing it to be multiplicative on $\mathbb{Q}$ . As an example, $$\sigma_2\left(\frac{64}{63}\right)=\sigma_2\left(2^6\cdot3^{-2}\cdot7^{-1}\right)=\frac{1-2^{14}}{1-2^2}\cdot\frac{1-3^{-2}}{1-3^2}\cdot\frac{1-7^{0}}{1-7^2}=5461\cdot\left(-\frac{1}{9}\right)\cdot 0=0$$ In fact, if $\nu_p(x)=-1$ for some $p\in\mathbb{P}$ , then $\sigma_s(x)=0$ . My question then is Q: Is there a natural extension of Ramanujan sums $c_n(x)$ to $x\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that the former Dirichlet series identity holds true for every $k\in\mathbb{Q}$ ? That is, such that the following identity holds $$\boxed{\forall x\in\mathbb{Q}:\sigma_s(x)=\zeta(1-s)\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{c_n(x)}{n^{1-s}}}$$ One guess could be $c_n(x):=\sum\limits_{m\in(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times}e^{2\pi i\frac{m}{n}x}$ but I don't know if it actually works. I won't consider the proof of existence as a complete answer since I would like to find an explicit extension of $c_n$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ . $\color{red}{\bf\text{Update:}}$ As noted on Wikipedia , Hölder proved the identity $$c_n(k)=\mu\left(\frac{n}{(n,k)}\right)\frac{\varphi(n)}{\varphi\left(\frac{n}{(n,k)}\right)}$$ where $(\cdot,\cdot):\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}$ is the gcd function. One can naturally extend the gcd to $\mathbb{Q}$ by allowing the property $\forall x,y,\lambda\in\mathbb{Q}:(\lambda x,\lambda y)=|\lambda|(x,y)$ . This extension also respects the property that $\nu_p((x,y))=\min\{\nu_p(x),\nu_p(y)\}$ . With this in mind, one can extend $c_{n}(x)$ to rational $x$ as above. For example, if $p$ is a prime, then $$c_n\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)=\mu\left(\frac{n}{(n,1/p)}\right)\frac{\varphi(n)}{\varphi\left(\frac{n}{(n,1/p)}\right)}=\mu\left(\frac{pn}{(pn,1)}\right)\frac{\varphi(n)}{\varphi\left(\frac{pn}{(pn,1)}\right)}$$ $$=\mu\left(pn\right)\frac{\varphi(n)}{\varphi\left(pn\right)}=\begin{cases}0 & \text{ if } p\ \vert\ n\\ -\frac{\mu(n)}{p-1} & \text{ if } p\ \not\vert\ n\end{cases}$$ It is easy to show that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(pn)}{n^s}=-\frac{p^s}{1-p^s}\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}$ which leads us to the following $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{c_n(1/p)}{n^s}= -\frac{1}{p-1}\sum_{n=1\\ p\not\vert n}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}=-\frac{1}{p-1}\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n^s}-\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(pn)}{p^sn^s}\right)$$ $$=-\frac{1}{p-1}\left(\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}+\frac{1}{1-p^s}\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\right)=-\frac{1}{p-1}\left(1+\frac{1}{1-p^s}\right)\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}$$ But this doesn't work as it would lead to $$\sigma_s(p^{-1})=-\frac{1}{p-1}\left(1+\frac{1}{1-p^{1-s}}\right)\neq0$$ Moreover, if $\alpha\geq2$ is an integer, then $\mu\left(\frac{n}{(n,p^{-\alpha})}\right)=\mu(p^\alpha n)=0$ as $p^\alpha n$ is not square-free and, in turn, this would lead to $c_n(p^{-\alpha})=0\Rightarrow \sigma_s(p^{-\alpha})=0$ . This is quite interesting but not what I wanted (nor what I expected). But maybe there's a better extension of the formula proven by Hölder that does the trick.","It can be shown that the divisor function defined for can be expressed as a Dirichlet series with the Ramanujan sums defined for and with the following identity It is easy to show that, since is a bijection on , as we only permute the invertible elements.

Let $E_{1,\chi}\in M_1(N,\chi)$ be the (normalized) weight 1 Eisenstein series of $\chi$ .

Then if $k:\mathbb{H}\times\mathbb{H}$ is a point pair invariant, and $K(z,w)=\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}k(\gamma z,w)$ is the averaging of $k$ over $\Gamma$ . Then if we define the operator $T_k:L^2(X)\rightarrow L^2(X)$ defined by $f\mapsto \int_Xk(z,w)d\mu(w)$ . Now if we take $\{u_m(z)\}$ be a complete set of eigenvectors for $T_k$ such that $T_ku_m=\lambda_k u_m$ , then considering the spectral parameters $t_m$ where $\lambda_m=\frac{1}{4}+t_m^2$ , then we will have that $T_k u_m=h(t_m)u_m$ and $h$ is a suitable test function. Now we have that Selberg's pretrace formula says that $$ K(z,w)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty h(t_m)u_m(z)u_m(w) $$ Now the classical Selberg's trace formula is obtained from the above by setting $z=w$ and integrating over $X$ . This gives $$ \sum_{m=0}^\infty h(t_m)=\int_X K(z,z)d\mu(z)=\int_{\Gamma\backslash\mathbb{H}}\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}k(\gamma z,z)d\mu(z) $$ Then breaking up the righthand side up into conjugacy classes and examining how the integrals work gives the classical version of Selberg's trace formula. What I am interested is a version of Selberg's trace formula involving the Hecke eigenvalues (as the $\lambda_m$ are the Laplace eigenvalues). Thus, if I let $T_n$ be the Hecke operator, and if I choose my basis $u_m$ to also simultaneously be Hecke eigenfunctions such that $T_nu_m=\lambda_m(n)$ (I know notation is confusing, but I will use $\lambda_m(n)$ to be the $n$ th Hecke eigenvalue associated to the function $u_m$ ). Now if we start off with Selberg's pretrace formula, and we apply the Hecke operator $T_n$ (in the variable $z$ ), let's start with the spectral side (i.e. the righthand side): $$ T_n\left(\sum_{m=0}^\infty h(t_m)u_m(z)u_m(w)\right)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty h(t_m)\lambda_m(n)u_m(z)u_m(w) $$ Then setting $z=w$ , and integrating over $X$ , and using the fact we choose the $u_m$ to be orthonormal, we will have that the left-hand side will become $$ \sum_{m=0}^\infty h(t_m)\lambda_m(n) $$ Now if we take the right-hand side and we apply $T_n$ , then we find that $$ T_n\left(K(z,w)\right)=T_n\left(\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}k(\gamma z,w)\right)=\sum_{\gamma\in R(n)}k(\gamma z,w) $$ where we have $R(n)$ denote integral matrices of determinant $n$ . Then if we set $z=w$ and integrate we should get the other side of the trace formula. Now, I am curious if there is a reference that goes through this side of the trace formula after applying the Hecke operators (going through the identity, elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic contributions). If such a reference is known as I am sure it might be a lot of details I would appreciate to see it.","I am looking for a reference (if one exists) for an application of Selberg's trace formula after the Hecke operators have been applied.

31,Ramification Index 2 in Galois closure of field with squarefree discriminant,Ramification Index 2 in Galois closure of field with squarefree discriminant,,"This is about Exercise 7 from here . Let $K$ be a number field of degree $n$ with Galois group $S_n$ whose discriminant $D$ is squarefree. Prove that the Galois closure of $K$ is unramified over all finite places of $\Bbb Q(\sqrt D)$ . Let $L$ be the Galois closure. We have to show that for all rational primes $p\mid D$ , the ramification index of $p$ in $L$ is $2$ . There is a hint to the exercise suggesting to first prove that there is exactly one ramified prime above $p$ in $K$ and then deduce that the inertia group of $p$ in $L$ has order $2$ . The first part is not difficult, it follows from the usual bounds on the valuation of the different, so we have $(p)={\frak p_1^2 p_2\cdots p}_r$ for distinct primes ${\frak p_1,\dots,p}_r$ of $K$ . Here is my argument for the second part. Let $K=\Bbb Q(\alpha)$ for some algebraic integer $\alpha$ and let $f$ be its minimal polynomial. Let $\frak P$ be a prime of $L$ lying above $p$ . Consider the completion $L_{\frak P}$ . It is the splitting field of $f$ over $\Bbb Q_p$ . Note also that over $\Bbb Q_p$ $f$ factors as $f=f_1\cdots f_r$ corresponding to the primes ${\frak p_1,\dots\frak p}_r$ . For $2\leq i\leq r$ , ${\frak p}_i$ is unramified over $p$ , so $f_i$ generates an unramified extension of $\Bbb Q_p$ . Also $f_1$ must generate a degree $2$ totally ramified extension. Now $L_{\frak P}$ is the composite of all the splitting fields of the $f_i$ and from this it is clear that $e_{L_{\frak P}/\Bbb Q_p}=2$ . Question : Is this correct? I didn't use the hypothesis that $\operatorname{ Gal}(L/\Bbb Q)=S_n$ . Also I am wondering if there is a way that avoids the completion and proves this directly, e.g. using the inertia group as the hint suggested. I was thinking that perhaps one could show that because the way $p$ splits in $K$ , at most two of the roots of $f$ become equal mod $\frak P$ (or at least one could choose $f$ like that).

36,Difference of prime powers as linear combination of jumping champions,Difference of prime powers as linear combination of jumping champions,,"Reading the preprint Bounded gaps between primes in short intervals by Ryan Alweiss and Sammy Luo ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05437 ), I came up with the following question: Can the difference $\Delta$ between prime powers $p^a$ and $q^b$ not exceeding $x$ always be written as a finite linear combination $\sum_{i=1}^{k'} c_{i}J_{i}(x)$ with non negative integral coefficients $c_{i}$ of the jumping champions up to $x$ $J_{i}(x)$ with $i<j\Longrightarrow J_{i}(x)>J_{j}(x)$ and $\lVert\Delta\rVert:=\sum_{i=1}^{k'}c_{i}$ minimal? I'm especially interested in the case $ab\leq 2$ . Edit: assuming an affirmative answer to the previous question can one get $\lVert\Delta\rVert=O(\log^{O(1)}x)$ ? Here comes a vague idea: assuming the jumping champions are the primorials $P_{m}:=\prod_{i=1}^{m}p_{i}$ , from $P_{m}=m^{m(1+o(1))}$ and writing $w_{x}$ for the ""power square root"" of $x$ i.e. $w_{x}^{w_{x}}=x$ , from $\log^{\log x}x=(e^{\log\log x})^{\log x}=e^{\log x.\log\log x}=x^{\log\log x}$ one gets $w_{x}=o(\log x)$ . Now from Bertrand's postulate one has $P_{m+1}\leq 2p_{m}P_{m}\lesssim 2m\log m P_{m}$ so one should have $\lVert\Delta\rVert\leq 2k'w_{x}\log w_{x}$ . But $k'\leq w_{x}$ hence $\lVert\Delta\rVert\leq 2w_{x}^{2}\log w_{x}=o(\log^{2}(x)\log\log x)=O(\log^{O(1)}x)$ . Edit April 24th 2023: by the way, can one prove that $H_{m}:=\lim\inf_{n\to\infty}p_{n+m}-p_{n}$ is reached for $\lVert\Delta\rVert=m$ with the finite sequence $(c_{i})_{1\leq i\leq k'}$ non decreasing? This may lead to a combinatorial prediction of diameters of prime constellations. Also we may make an analogy between $\lVert\Delta\rVert$ and the dimension of a vector space and between the number of non vanishing coefficients $c_{i}$ and the rank of some endomorphism defined thereon. Edit April 27th 2023: I've just seen that someone voted to close because this question ""needs details or clarity"", so I refer to https://mathoverflow.net/questions/61842/about-goldbachs-conjecture and especially to the definition of natural configuration therein so as to provide an insight of why primorials and thus conjecturally jumping champions are expected to preserve the primality of a number to which it's added or substracted (and thus why the difference of prime powers should be a linear combination with non negative integral coefficients of jumping champions provided they are primorials). From the point of view of configurations the sequence of primorials ""converges to $0$ "" as the configuration of order $u$ of both a primorial greater or equal to $p_{u}\sharp$ and of $0$ only consists of a sequence of $0$ . Taking $J_{1}(x)$ as a value for $d$ in the preprint of Alweiss and Luo may allow to pass from $2n=p+q^2$ with $p$ and $q$ prime to $2n=p'+q'$ with $p'$ and $q'$ prime with $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$ shifts of the integer $r$ such that both $n-r$ and $n+r$ are prime powers. The general idea would be to first strengthen Chen's theorem to ""every large enough even integer is the sum of a prime and the square of a prime or the sum of two primes"" and then reduce the first case to the second one. Edit April 29th 2023: say an interval $I$ (respectively its length $g=\lambda(I)$ ) of the form $[P^{a},Q^{b}]$ with $P$ and $Q$ prime and $Q-P$ minimal is an $m$ -jumping prime power interval (respectively gap) of level $l=ab$ if $m$ is the infimum of the set of integers $t$ such that $g$ is the sum of $t$ jumping champions up to $Q^{b}$ . As an example $g_{30}=p_{31}-p_{30}=127-113=14=6+6+2$ is a $3$ -jumping prime power gap of level $1$ . Now denote by $\gamma_{m,l}(J)$ the number of $m$ -jumping prime powers intervals of level $l$ contained in $J$ such that the total number of jumping prime power intervals of level at most $l_{0}$ contained in $J$ is $N_{l_{0}}(J)=\sum_{m\geq 1,l\leq l_{0}}\gamma_{m,l}(J)$ . The idea is to express the lengths of the intervals $I_{1}:=[\min(p',q'),\max(p',q')]$ and $I_{2}:=[\min(p,q^{2}),\max(p,q^{2})]$ with $2n=p'+q'=p+q^{2}$ with $p, q, p'$ and $q'$ prime as sums of jumping prime power gaps of level at most $2$ , each being of the form $\Delta$ and show that the number of $m$ -jumping prime power intervals of level at most $2$ contained in $I_{j}$ with $m>1$ and $j\in\{1,2\}$ is an $o(N_{2}(I_{j}))$ . Are there results in the literature which may help to reach this goal? Note that this partly boils down to showing that most coefficients $c_{i}$ in a prime gap of the form $\Delta$ equal $0$ or $1$ . Also, assuming an affirmative answer to the first question, we may set $I_{j}$ with $j\in\{1,2\}$ such that $\Delta:=\lambda(I_{j})$ is a $\lVert\Delta\rVert$ -jumping prime power gap of level $j$ . Denoting by $r_{0}(n)$ the smallest non negative integer $r'$ such that $(n-r',n+r')\in\mathbb{P}^{2}$ and by $k_{0}(n):=\pi(n+r_{0}(n))-\pi(n-r_{0}(n))$ we get $2r_{0}(n)=:\Delta\Longrightarrow k_{0}(n)\leq\lVert\Delta\rVert$ and the conjecture in the current edit implies $k_{0}(n)\lesssim\lVert\Delta\rVert$ . Writing $2r_{0}(n)=k_{0}(n)\log^{1+\varepsilon_{k_{0}(n)}}n=\lVert\Delta\rVert\log^{1+\varepsilon'_{\lvert\Delta\rVert}}n$ this and the PNT imply that $\lim_{k_{0}(n)\to\infty}\varepsilon_{k_{0}(n)}=\lim_{k_{0}(n)\to\infty}\varepsilon'_{\lVert\Delta\rVert}=0$ . From the reasoning leading to $\lVert\Delta\rVert=o(\log^{2}n.\log\log n)$ we get $k_{0}(n)=o(\log^{2}n.\log\log n)$ and thus $2r_{0}(n)=o(\log^{3+h}n.\log\log n)$ where $h=\sup_{k_{0}(m),m\leq n}\varepsilon_{k_{0}(m)}$ , giving further evidence to the hypothesis that one may pass from $2n=p+q^{2}$ to $2n=p'+q'$ in $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$ shifts of the integer $r$ such that both $n-r$ and $n+r$ are prime powers. Edit April 30th 2023: a way to do so would be to use the rank reducing shift $S_{n}(r):=\frac{(\Omega(n+r)+\Omega(n-r)-2)+\vert\Omega(n+r)-\Omega(n-r)\vert}{2}g_{min}(n)$ with $g_{min}(n)=2.3^{1_{3\not\mid n}}$ iteratively to get a finite sequence $(r'_{l}(n))$ with $r'_{0}(n):=r$ and $r'_{l'+1}(n):=r'_{l'}(n)+S_{n}(r'_{l'}(n))$ to get a primality radius $r_{0}(n)$ , i.e get $(n-r_{0}(n),n+r_{0}(n))\in\mathbb{P}^{2}$ . As $\Omega(m)\leq\frac{\log m}{\log 2}$ for any positive integer $m$ , one may be able to prove that this algorithm with initial value $r'_{0}(n):=0$ terminates after $O(\log^{1+o(1)} n)$ steps and thus that $r_{0}(n)=O(\log^{2+o(1)}n)$ . Edited on May 5th 2023 to try to resolve conflict of notations. Edit May 7th 2023: in the special case $ab=1$ $\Delta_{1}=q-p$ is obviously a linear combination of prime gaps with positive integral coefficients. Now consider the case $\Delta_{2}=q^{2}-p=q^{2}-q+q-p=q(q-1)+q-p$ . As $q-1=q-3+2$ and $2$ being both a prime gap and a jumping champion, assuming $\Delta_{1}=\sum_{i}c_{i}J_{i}(x)$ one gets $\Delta_{2}=\Delta_{1}+q\Delta'_{1}$ where $\Delta'_{1}:=\sum_{i}c'_{i}J_{i}(x)$ hence $\Delta_{2}=\sum_{i}c''_{i}J_{i}(x)$ . Edit January 10th 2024: the dual question, namely viewing jumping champions as linear combinations with non negative coefficients of prime gaps, may help reduce the known upper bound of $246$ of Polymath8b to $30=5\times 6$ replacing thrice $6$ by $2+4$ to get an admissible $k$ -tuple with $k=9$ of diameter $30$ , hence a prime constellation. In that case one would get $\lVert\Delta\rVert=3+3+2=8=k-1$ . The fact that the $8$ -simplex is convex and self-dual may be useful in the variational method used in the aforementioned Polymath project.","Reading the preprint Bounded gaps between primes in short intervals by Ryan Alweiss and Sammy Luo ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05437 ), I came up with the following question: Can the difference between prime powers and not exceeding always be written as a finite linear combination with non negative integral coefficients of the jumping champions up to with and minimal?

For fixed $k$ , I'm wondering what can be said about the image of $e_k$ over $(\mathbb{N}^+)^n$ ; that is, the output over all $n$ -tuples of positive integers.

Can anyone provide me some hints with any reference to this fact? Edit: It is Theorem C.2.6 in Diophantine Geometry, M. Hindry and J. Silverman. The construction of formal groups and the proof of the theorem are quite similar to the elliptic curve case.

Proof: If $p=2$ the result is obvious (if a number is odd then it's square is odd and the same for even numbers), let's say $p$ is an odd prime for the proof. Notice that $$\sum_{i=1}^{x} i^p-{(i-1)}^p=x^p \tag{*}$$ This is the property we will use, let's expand that ${(i-1)}^p$ part, by binomial theorem we have $$(i-1)^p=\sum_{k=0}^{p} {p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^k$$ Let's expand this for the first and last term to get: $$(i-1)^p={p \choose 0} \cdot i^{(p-0)}(-1)^0+\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k}.i^{(p-k)}(-1)^k+{p \choose p} \cdot i^{(0)}(-1)^p$$ Here as $p$ is an odd prime $(-1)^p=-1$ , if we substitute this in we get: $$(i-1)^p=i^p+ \left(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^k \right)-1$$ If we substitute this in $(*)$ we get: $$\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left( i^p-\left(i^p+\left( \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^k \right)-1\right)\right)=x^p$$ If we do the algebra we get: $$\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left(- \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^k \right)+\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x^p$$ We can see that $\sum_{i=1}^{x}1=x$ , substituting this in gives us: $$\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left( \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^{k+1} \right)+x=x^p$$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left( \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^{k+1} \right)=x^p-x$$ Now here we know that when $p$ is a prime and $k$ is not $p$ or $0$ , the combination in ${p \choose k}$ is always divisible by $p$ , in that sum every combination satisfies this so everything that is summed there are divisible by $p$ , consequently so is their sum, then we have the following: $$p|\sum_{i=1}^{x}\left( \sum_{k=1}^{p-1}{p \choose k} \cdot i^{(p-k)}(-1)^{k+1} \right)$$ which means $p|x^p-x$ and we know that in modulus this implies $$x^p \equiv x \pmod{p}$$ Is this proof valid?

I was looking at this problem for fixed $\alpha,\beta$ but that's really hard, so I wanted to prove that there is at least one pair of integers with the property. So, supposing the opposite of that: for all $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{N}$ the set of primes satisfying the property $\gcd(\text{ord}_p(\alpha),\text{ord}_p(\beta))=1$ is bounded. So we can define a function $f(n)$ to be the greatest prime with the desired property over all pairs of integers $\alpha,\beta\leq n$ . Increasing $n$ appends more pairs of integers to the numbers over which $f$ has to satisfy its definition, plus the ones that were $\leq n$ , so $f$ is nondecreasing. Also for a prime $p\equiv 3 \mod 4$ we can take $\alpha\equiv -1$ and $\beta\equiv w^2$ where $w$ is a primitive root and we have $\gcd(\text{ord}_p(\alpha),\text{ord}_p(\beta))=\gcd\left(2,\frac{p-1}2\right)=1$ so $f$ is unbounded.

If $p-1$ has $k$ distinct prime divisors, there are $2^{k-1}$ ways of writing it as $p-1=\theta\phi$ with $\gcd(\theta,\phi)=1$ and with a primitive root $w$ we can generate $w^\theta$ and $w^\phi$ with our property. So for each of those exponentially increasing quantity of pairs of numbers, they have to all conspire to be outside the forbidden square for all primes greater than $f(n)$ .

In proving a result of Chebychev that there exist positive constants $x_0$ , $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $$ c_1 \frac{x}{\log x} \le \pi(x) \le c_2\frac{x}{\log x}$$ for all $x>x_0$ , the following bounds on $\psi(x)$ were used $$ x\log 2 + O(\log x) \le \psi(x) \le 2x\log 2 + O(\log^2(x))$$ together with the result that $$\frac{\psi(x)}{x} = \frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x} + o(1)$$ The author says that for any $c_1 < \log 2$ and any $c_2 > 2\log 2$ the theorem holds. In an attempt to fill the details, I did the following: starting from $$ x\log 2 + O(\log x) \le \psi(x) \le 2x\log 2 + O(\log^2(x)),$$ divide through by $x$ to obtain $$\log 2 + o(1) \le \frac{\psi(x)}{x} \le 2\log2 + o(1)$$ Now, replace $\frac{\psi(x)}{x}$ with $\frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x} + o(1)$ so that $$\log 2 + o(1) \le \frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x} + o(1) \le 2\log2 + o(1)$$ Here's a step I'm not sure of and need clarification: can the little $o$ term in the middle be subtracted across the board to get $$\log 2 + o(1) \le \frac{\pi(x)\log x}{x}\le 2\log2 + o(1)$$ $$\frac{x}{\log x}(\log 2 + o(1)) \le \pi(x) \le \frac{x}{\log x}(2\log2 + o(1))$$ and hence for any $c_1 < \log2, c_2 > 2\log 2$ the theorem follows? Secondly, the author says that since $\frac{2\log 2}{\log 2}=2,$ a corollary of this result is that for every $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists a prime number in the interval $[x, (2+\epsilon)x]$ for all $x > x_0(\epsilon)$ .

So for any $S$ -module homomorphism $f: M\to N$ in category $\mathscr{C}$ , we get a unique $T$ -module homomorphism $F_{M,N}(f): F(M) \to F(N)$ in category $\mathscr{D}$ by the injectiveness property.

Since $\sigma^*(k)$ is divisible by $2^{\omega(k)}$ if $k$ is odd, where $\omega=$ counts the number of distinct prime divisors of $k$ , for an odd perfect number $n$ we get (Let now $n$ be an odd perfect number): $$2n = \sigma(n) = \sum_{d \in S_n} d \sigma^*(\frac{n}{d^2}) = \sum_{d \in S_n} d 2^{\omega(n/d^2)} k_d $$ where $k_d = \frac{\sigma^*(n/d^2)}{2^{\omega(n/d^2)}}$ are natural numbers. Let $\hat{d}$ be the largest square divisor of $n$ . Then: $\omega(n/d^2)\ge \omega(n/\hat{d}^2)$ . Hence we get: $$2n = 2^{\omega(n/\hat{d}^2)} \sum_{d \in S_n} d l_d$$ for some natural numbers $l_d$ . If the prime $2$ divides not the prime power $2^{\omega(n/\hat{d}^2})$ , we must have $\omega(n/\hat{d}^2)=0$ hence $n=\hat{d}^2$ is a square number, which is in contradiction to Eulers theorem on odd perfect numbers.

I wonder whether there could also exist a 'nice' integral expression for $\xi^*(s)$ ? (with 'nice', I mean not simply a double integral of the known integrals for $\xi(s)$ ). ADDED 1: my first (failed) attempt: Replace $\Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\,\Gamma\left(-\frac{s}{2}\right)$ as follows: $$\xi^*(s)=s\,(1-s^2)\,\frac{2\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}\,\zeta(s)\,\zeta(-s)$$ Start the construction from the following integral representation: $$\frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}=\int^\infty_0 \frac{t^{\frac{s}{2}}}{t+t^2}\, dt \qquad 0 < \Re(s) < 2$$ Change variable: $t=n^2\,x, dt = n^2\, dx$ : $$\frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}=\int^\infty_0 n^s x^\frac{s}{2}\,\frac{1}{x+(n\,x)^2}\, dx \qquad 1 < \Re(s) < 2$$ Summation on both sides: $$\frac{\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}\sum^\infty_{n=1} \frac{1}{n^s}=\int^\infty_0 x^\frac{s}{2}\,\sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{x+(n\,x)^2}\, dx \qquad 1 < \Re(s) < 2$$ Which simplifies into: $$\frac{2\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}\zeta(s)= \int^\infty_0 x^{\frac{s}{2}-1}\,\left(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{x}}\,\coth\left(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{x}}\right)-1\right)\, dx \qquad 1 < \Re(s) < 2$$ Change variable once more: $x=k^{-2}\,u, dx = k^{-2}\, du$ and sum both sides: $$\frac{2\pi}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi s}{2}\right)}\zeta(s)\sum^\infty_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^{-s}}= \int^\infty_0 u^{\frac{s}{2}-1}\,\sum^\infty_{k=1}\left(\frac{\pi\,k}{\sqrt{u}}\,\coth\left(\frac{\pi\,k}{\sqrt{u}}\right)-1\right)\, du \qquad \infty$$ This obviously fails and unless I missed a tweak, I do need a new approach... ADDED 2: my second attempt (successful, however with a double integral): $$\xi^*(s)=s^2(s^2-1)\int^\infty_1\int^\infty_1 \left(x^\frac{s}{2}+x^{\frac{1-s}{2}}\right)\left(y^{-\frac{s}{2}}+y^{\frac{1+s}{2}}\right)\frac{\psi(x)\,\psi(y)}{x\,y}\, dx dy + \xi(s)+\xi(-s) -1$$ With $\displaystyle \psi(z)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\pi\,n^2z}$ .

99,Is there a deeper reason for the classification of moduli in which a primitive root exists?,Is there a deeper reason for the classification of moduli in which a primitive root exists?,,"The primitive root theorem classifies the set of moduli for which a primitive root exists as $$1,2,4,p^k,2p^k$$ where $p$ is an odd prime and $k$ is a positive integer. I have worked through a proof of this assertion which can be broken down as follows: It is clear that $1,2,4$ each have a primitive root. Higher powers of $2$ do not have a primitive root by induction. If the modulus has an odd prime factor and the modulus has a primitive root, then the modulus is either a power of that prime or twice a power of that prime. Every odd prime has a primitive root (using polynomials in modular arithmetic). Primitive roots modulo a prime can be ""lifted"" to moduli that are higher powers of the prime. Primitive roots in a modulus can be lifted to twice that modulus. This is all well and good, but this proof just works towards the expected result using standard elementary techniques without providing much insight. I was wondering: Is there a deep reason for why the classification of suitable moduli is so strange? It's a natural question to wonder when a reduced residue system has a multiplicative generator, yet the set we end up with carves out an unexpected subset of the positive integers. I don't entirely know what would qualify as a satisfactory answer, but some possibilities are: The set of integers $1,2,4,p^k,2p^k$ appears in other parts of mathematics. There is a more general theorem of which this is merely a shadow. There is a different proof that is less reminiscent of mechanical verification. EDIT: I came across a couple of quotes that sum up my feelings. What the standard proof is like, if I may exaggerate: Well, I have slightly mixed feelings about [the classification of finite simple groups]. First of all, it takes so many pages to prove; it seems to me the degree of understanding must be pretty limited if that is the only way it can be done. - Michael Atiyah, The Mathematical Intelligencer What I'm looking for: Not only is the above combinatorial proof much shorter than our previous proof, but it also makes the reason for the simple answer completely transparent.
