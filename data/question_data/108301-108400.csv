I wish to find the maximum and minimum of this function with respect to the constraints, $$\vec{r}\cdot\vec{r}=1,\qquad\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}=0,$$ where $\vec{r}=(k_1,k_2,k_3)$, is an arbitrary constant vector. I do not wish to solve this using Lagrange multipliers, but instead via a geometrical argument. The constraints are clearly the unit sphere intersecting with a plane normal to $\vec{k}$ through the origin. So this is a unit circle rotated in 3 dimensions through the origin, dependent on the direction of the vector $\vec{k}$. So to analyse to the maxima and minima of $E$ w.r.t. to the constraints above we can consider the intersections of the rotated circle through the origin with the family of ellipsoids $$E(\vec{r})=\text{constant}$$ My question is, is this the right way to look at this problem from a geometrical perspective? If we let $E=constant=\lambda$, imagine this $\lambda>>1$, so that the ellipsoid is very large and outside of the unit sphere. Then as we lower the value of $E$ and hence $\lambda$ eventually as some point on the intersection of the plane $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}=0$ with the unit sphere and the ellipsoid will touch. This point will be the point that maximises $E$ and similarly the last point to touch the ellipsoid as it is shrunk further will be the minimum, is this correct?

Is my idea correct so far? Thanks a lot in advance.","I'm trying to solve the following question: For $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\vec{x},\vec{y} \neq \vec{0}$ find $\vec{z} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\vec{z}\parallel\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}-\vec{z} \perp \vec{x}$. I started with the dot product: $$ \begin{align} \vec{y}-\vec{z} \perp \vec{x} &\Leftrightarrow (y_1-z_1)x_1+(y_2-z_2)x_2=0\\ \vec{z} \parallel \vec{x} &\Leftrightarrow \vec{z}=\alpha \vec{x} \vee \vec{x}=\alpha\vec{z}, \;\, \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \end{align} $$ Now I put $\vec{z}=\alpha \vec{x}$ into the first equation: $$y_1x_1-\alpha x_1x_1 + y_2 \alpha x_2 -\alpha x_2 x_2=0$$ But now I don't know how to proceed.

Such a set of triangles can generate all triangles since we can multiply any real number to all three sides, which gives a scalar of such triangles.

(My implementation is in Haskell in case anyone wants to know.) The problem is that not all of the boundary points are included. In fact, my implementation is highly sensitive to the order of the points in the input (since the input is technically a list, not a set). I am looking for some help from a mathematical perspective in order to fix the problem. To start, let me describe how I understand the algorithm: Input: $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ . Output: The convex hull $H$ of $S$ Define the point $P$ as follows: First find the subset $Y$ of $S$ of all points $(x, y)$ such that $y$ is minimum. Then $P$ is the point in $Y$ such that $x$ is minimum. Define $\preceq$ on $S$ as $P_1 \preceq P_2$ iff $\theta_1 \leq \theta_2$ where $(r_i, \theta_i)$ is the polar representation of the vector $\vec{PP_i}$ . Define the sequence $A = \{P_i\}$ such that $P_i \in S$ and $P_i \preceq P_{i+1}$ for each $i$ . Define $H_0 = A$ . Define the subsequence $H_i=\{Q_i\}$ of $H_{i-1}$ by removing the point $P_j$ from $H_{i-1}$ such that the angle $\angle P_jP_{j+1}P_{j+2}$ makes a right-hand turn and $j$ is minimum. Let $H=H_i$ where $H_i$ contains no angle $\angle P_jP_{j+1}P_{j+2}$ which makes a right-hand turn. Now for a more concrete example to explain the problem: Let $S = \{(x, y) : x, y \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \leq x, y \leq 4\}$ . (Since my implementation uses a list rather than a set, $S$ is actually a the sequence $S=\{P_i\}$ of these points in lexicographical order.) From step 1, $P = (0, 0)$ . My implementation also uses a stable sort, so for $P_i, P_j \in S$ , if $\theta_i = \theta_j$ (again using polar coordinates for the points), then $P_i \prec P_j$ if $i < j$ . This creates a problem as I consider the points $(0, 1)$ , $(0, 2)$ , $(0, 3)$ , and $(0, 4)$ in step 4 because they appear in the sequence $S$ in that order and they are the vertices for angles with right-handed turns when they are considered. For example, the angle formed by the points $(x, y)$ , $(0, 1)$ , $(0, 2)$ where $x \not=0$ is a right-handed turn. How do I modify the ordering of step 2 so that the points on the boundary appear in the correct order to obtain straight angles as I consider them in step 4? p.s. I have decided to state my question in mathematical terms, but if you think I would get more/better feedback from programmers, I will post it on SO instead and try to frame it in programming terms.

I think what I need is an algorithm to do the following, Here's the problem: For any large rectangle, place the least amount of smaller rectangles inside the large rectangle with as equal spacing as possible, the smaller rectangles will all be $A$ units wide and $B$ units long. Here's the parameters: Smaller rectangles can only have a maximum area of $250$ units. Smaller rectangle can't be more than $20$ units in any direction. Smaller rectangle can't be less than $10$ units in any direction. Smaller rectangles may overlap. Here's how I manually solve it, takes a while and is messy: I divide the big rectangle area by the smaller rectangle area. This gives me the minimum amount of rectangles possible, assuming no minimum or maximum sizing limitations. In some cases, the minimum or maximum sizing limitations of the smaller rectangles means I will have to use a few more rectangles. If I had a $5 \text{unit}\times  200.01 \text{unit}$ big rectangle, for example, I would have to use $11$ small rectangles to fill the big rectangle (the $0.01$ makes me have to add another rectangle by itself), since I can't make the small rectangles longer than $20$ units according to the parameters. For most of these problems, the best way to figure out the best solution is to find the ratio of the sides of the big rectangle (a $200 \times 400$ rectangle would have a ratio $1:2$), and scale that down to the smaller rectangles. However, I have to be careful not to have a ratio that exceeds the size limits imposed on the smaller rectangles ($10$ minimum, $20$ maximum). Thanks for any help.
