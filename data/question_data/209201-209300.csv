I've been working on some problems in my introductory discrete mathematics course, and I am trying to figure out a proof that $R(3,3,3) \leq 17.$ I initially consider an instance where we have a $K_{17}$ colored in the arbitrary colors $c_1,c_2,c_3$. Consider a vertex $v \in K_{17}.$ It should have 16 edges coming out of it, so by the pigeonhole principle, it should have 6 edges coming out of it that are colored in one color. Without loss of generality, we can say that these are colored $c_1$. Consider these $c_1$ adjacent vertices $v_1,...,v_6$. If there is a $c_1$ colored edge between any one of them, we are done. Otherwise, I am not entirely sure what I can do with 6 vertices whose colors are arbitrary colored $c_2$ or $c_3$.

Now there are 21 places to place the women, so we can arrange them in $20! \cdot 2$ (I multiplied by 2 because there is one more place we can occupy with a women, so if I want to use it as well it's a total different permutation) So in total: $19! \cdot 20! \cdot 2$ I'm not quite sure about my solution, can anyone please verify if it's true?

Attempt at solving the problem: Let $A$ be the event that a child has autism, and $B$ the event where a child is tested positive for autism (in a clinic). We are given: $P(A)=0.01$ (one percent of children have autism). $P(B|A)=0.9$ and $P(B|\overline{A})=0.03$ (corresponds to 90% of autistic children having a positive test result and 3% of non-autistic children having a positive test result) Let $1$ and $2$ denote the clinics for which a child is tested. Then the probability that both clinics yield the same diagnosis is: $P((B_{1}\cap B_{2})\cup(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}})) = P(B_{1}\cap B_{2}) + P(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}})$(*) where $B_i=B$ for $i=1,2$ (This should follow from the fact that both clinics receive the same probabilities for diagnosing a child) At this point I had two different ways to approach the problem, I could either express (*) as: $P(B_{1}\cap B_{2}) + P(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}}) = P(A)P(B_{1}\cap B_{2}|A)+P(\overline{A})P(B_{1}\cap B_{2}|\overline{A})+P(A)P(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}}|A)+P(\overline{A})P(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}}|\overline{A})$ (follows from the law of total probability) (Knowing $B_1$ and $B_2$ are independent, it follows I can express $P({B_{1}}\cap {B_{2}}|A)$ as $P({B_{1}}|A)P({B_{2}}|A)$, where this approach leads me to the 'correct' answer) or I could compute $P(B)=P(A)P(B|A)+P(\overline{A})P(B|\overline{A})$ and express (*) as: $P(B_{1}\cap B_{2}) + P(\overline{B_{1}}\cap \overline{B_{2}}) = P(B_{1})P(B_{2})+P(\overline{B_{1}})P(\overline{B_{2}})$ (this follows from the clinics being independent and computing B from the law of total probability) Why does computing the probability in this second approach lead to me to the wrong answer?",,"['probability', 'discrete-mathematics', 'bayes-theorem']"

It's just ${52 \choose 13} {39 \choose 13} {26 \choose 13} {13 \choose 13}$. However, allowing players to have less than 13 cards makes it more complicated. I'd appreciate any help. Thanks. EDIT: I realized that I wasn't clear in my question. In some places I wrote that each player has a minimum of one card, where in others I wrote that the player has a minimum of zero cards. Honestly, I'm more interested in the setup of the solution than the actual number, so answer with whichever constraint you feel like.",,"['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'card-games']"
90,Lines in the plane from Concrete Mathematics. How many bounded regions are there?,Lines in the plane from Concrete Mathematics. How many bounded regions are there?,,"I'm studying Concrete Mathematics by Donald Knuth. While doing the warmup questions, from the recurrence chapter, I stumbled upon an interesting problem. I have an intuition about the solution but I don't know how to express it. If you can give me any pointers I would greatly appreciate it. The problem that I'm interested in is based on this original problem: What is the maximum number $L(n)$ of regions defined by $n$ lines in the plane. The book goes to explain the recurrence $L(n) = L(n-1) + n$. We identify this pattern from generating solutions for the first few smaller scenarios $L(0) = 1$ $L(1) = 2$ $L(2) = 4$ $L(3) = 7$ and so on... The book then identifies the ""closed form"" $L(n) = n(n + 1)/2 + 1$ And now the problem I'm trying to solve: Some of the regions defined by $n$ lines in the plane are infinite, while others are bounded. What's the maximum possible number of bounded regions? Knuth stresses the importance of looking at smaller scenarios when we try to first understand a problem. In doing so I realized that when $n$ is $0, 1$ or $2$` we don't have any bounded areas. Once we get to $n = 3$` we get one bounded area. This would be our base case. If we go further we notice that the maximum bounded areas for $n = 4$ are $2$, $n = 3$ are $4$, $n = 5$ are $7$. It seems like the initial recurrence is happening again but for bounded areas it starts with $n = 3$ instead of $n = 0$. So the new recurrence would look like this for bounded areas: $L(n) = L(n - 3) + n - 3$. Am I reasoning correctly about this problem and is there a better way to look at it? Can anybody offer suggestions on how to express this rational better if it is correct or if it's not correct why that's the case?","I'm studying Concrete Mathematics by Donald Knuth.

I can solve this using the following reasoning: I must allocate $2 \cdot 3$ for the odd summands and $3 \cdot 2$ for even summands. Then I have to find the number of ways I can distribute the remaining 12 to the 5 unknowns.  Since these 12 must be distributed in pairs, it follows that the number of ways it can be done is ${5 + 6 - 1 \choose 5} = 210$, and the number of ways the unknowns can be arranged is $\frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$, hence the final answer is $2100$. I know this to be correct because I also wrote some code to compute it. However, I'm required to recast this problem as a generating function, and I'm lost as to how to do that. I would probably be able to solve it, once it is given as a generating function (which is my final goal).","I'm given an equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 = 24$, with a restriction that all of $x_i > 1$ and 2 of them are odd, the rest are even natural numbers.
