Here is what my book says about the different ways implications are worded I am struggling with how ""if p, then q"" is logically equivalent to ""p only if q"" The example I came up with With ""if p, then q"" - If Russell plays in the NFL, he plays football. With ""p only if q"" - Russell plays in the NFL only if he plays football. Say Russell plays in the NFL, plays football and plays soccer. With regards to that statement, my thought would be that ""If Russell plays in the NFL, he plays football"" implication would evaluate to true because Russell plays in the NFL and he plays football. However, with regards to ""Russell plays in the NFL only if he plays football"", wouldn't this evaluate to false because it says that the only way for Russell to play in the NFL is if he plays football. That means that playing football and soccer would not be a path for Russell to play in the NFL because it is not the  defined only way, only playing football.

97,In how many ways you can put n white balls and 2n black balls into n boxes if at least one black ball have to be in each box,In how many ways you can put n white balls and 2n black balls into n boxes if at least one black ball have to be in each box,,n - number of white balls 2n - number of black balls In how many ways you can put it into n boxes? It have to be at least one black ball in each box. My idea: First of all let's put one black ball in each box. We have got n white balls and n black balls to put into n boxes so my problem is how to put 2n balls into n boxes. So it's like solving an equation: $x_1+x_2+...+x_n=2n (x_n>=0)$ Is it correct?,n - number of white balls 2n - number of black balls In how many ways you can put it into n boxes?

However I'm unsure if $(Y,X) \in R$ since if $Y \subset X$ then that would make $X = Y$ (I think) breaking the condition that $X \neq Y$.
