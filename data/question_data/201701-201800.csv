8,Confusion of definition of covariant derivative along curve,Confusion of definition of covariant derivative along curve,,"I am currently studying Riemannian geometry, and have come across the following proposition: Proposition. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ and let $\gamma:I\to M$ be a $C^1$ -curve in $M$ . Then there exists a unique operator $$\frac{\mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{d}t}:C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)\to C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M),$$ such that for all $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{R}$ , $f\in C^\infty(I)$ , $X,Y\in C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}(\lambda X+\mu Y)}{\mathrm{d}t}=\lambda\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}+\mu\frac{\mathrm{D}Y}{\mathrm{d}t}$$ $$\frac{\mathrm{D}(fX)}{\mathrm{d}t}=f'X+f\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}$$ for each $t_0\in I$ , there exists an open subinterval $J$ of $I$ such that $t_0\in J$ and if $\bar{X}\in C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ is a vector field with $\bar{X}_{\gamma(t)}=X(t)$ for all $t\in J$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)=(\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\bar{X})_{\gamma(t_0)}.$$ In the above, $C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ refers to all smooth vector fields along $\gamma$ , i.e. smooth $X:I\to\mathrm{T}M$ with $\pi\circ X=\gamma$ , and $C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ refers to all smooth vector fields on $M$ . My problem with this proposition is that I don't quite think 3 makes sense, and I'm trying to figure out what it should be or how it should be interpreted. To see my problem, note first that the Levi-Civita connection on $(M,g)$ is a map \begin{align*} \nabla:C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)\times C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)&\to C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M), \\ (X,Y)&\mapsto \nabla_XY. \end{align*} Consequently the expression $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\bar{X}$ does not make sense, as $\dot\gamma$ is not in $C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ . Even identifying $\dot\gamma$ with $t\mapsto(\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))$ we still only have a vector field along $\gamma$ , i.e. an element of $C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ . So the only way to try to make sense of this is to try to interpret $\dot\gamma$ as a vector field on $M$ . If $\gamma$ is injective, this is not a problem. Simply note that $\gamma(I)$ defines a submanifold of $M$ locally, and so we can extend the map $\gamma(I)\to\mathrm{T}M$ , $p\mapsto(p,\dot{\gamma}(\gamma^{-1}(p))$ to a vector field on $M$ locally around each point, and this vector field would then take the place of $\dot\gamma$ in $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\bar{X}$ , and everything would make sense. The problem is, however, that if we do not assume $\gamma$ to be injective, we may have self-intersections, and for a given point $p\in\gamma(I)$ with $t_1,t_2\in I$ such that $\gamma(t_1)=\gamma(t_2)=p$ , we may have that $\dot{\gamma}(t_1)\neq\dot{\gamma}(t_2)$ , meaning that the above construction would be ill-defined. So to get around this, I assume the point is to choose $J\subseteq I$ sufficiently small so that $\gamma\vert_{J}$ is injective, and then do the above construction locally. Is this what is meant by the above? So could be write 3 instead as for each $t_0\in I$ , there exists an open subinterval $J$ of $I$ such that $t_0\in J$ , $\gamma\vert_J$ is injective, and if $\bar{X}\in C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ is a vector field with $\bar{X}_{\gamma(t)}=X(t)$ for all $t\in J$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)=(\nabla_{\dot\gamma\circ(\gamma\vert_J)^{-1}}\bar{X})_{\gamma(t_0)}.$$ or something along those lines?","I am currently studying Riemannian geometry, and have come across the following proposition: Proposition.

15,Cotangent space and pushforward,Cotangent space and pushforward,,"I wonder if there is a connection between the following two notions: Pushforward: For a smooth map $f:M\to N$ between smooth manifolds $M$ and $N$ , we define the pushforward $$df:TM\to TN$$ between the tangent spaces $TM$ and $TN$ . For a derivation $X\in T_xM$ , we define $df(X)=df\vert_x(X)$ to send a smooth map $g:N\to\mathbb R$ to $X(g\circ f)$ . Cotangent Space: On the other hand, we also define the cotangent space of $M$ at $x\in M$ to be $T^*_xM$ , the dual space of $T_xM$ . If we have a chart $\phi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ around $x$ , we have a basis $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ with $1\leq i\leq n$ . It induces a dual basis on $T^*_xM$ , given by the linear maps $dx_i\vert _x:T_xM\to\mathbb R$ , defined by $dx_i\vert_x\big(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\big)=\delta_{ij}$ (Kronecker delta). Why do we use the same notation for both? If I consider for instance the map $$x_i:\mathbb R^n\ni(x_1,\dots,x_n)\mapsto x_i\in\mathbb R,$$ it is unclear if by $dx_i\vert_x$ I mean the pushforward map or an element of the dual basis of $T_x^*\mathbb R^n$ . I figured both cannot be the same, though: If we consider $dx_i\vert_x$ as a pushforward, then $dx_i\vert_x(X)$ is a derivtion (hence a map).

Is $\omega$ decomposable in $\bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d$ ? Edit: Let me be more careful about the formulation of this question, as $\bigwedge^k\mathbb{C}^d$ can have two different non-isomorphic interpretation: $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}^d$ : Here we take exterior power over $\mathbb R$ . In particular, we think of $\mathbb{C}^d$ as a real $2d$ -dimensional vector space. In that case $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector subspace (over $\mathbb{R}$ ), and so we have the general   claim that “being decomposable” is a property which remains invariant under passing to a subspace. So, in that case, the answer is positive. Sasha's answer refers to this interpretation of the question. $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d$ : Here we take exterior power over $\mathbb C$ , and we think of $\mathbb{C}^d$ as a complex vector space. In this case $\mathbb{R}^d$ is not a (complex) vector subspace of $\mathbb{C}^d$ , but we can still view $\bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d$ as a subspace of $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d$ , via complexification . This because complexification commutes with exterior powers , so $(\bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d)^{\mathbb C}=\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}((\mathbb{R}^d)^{\mathbb C})=\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d.$ Any real vector space $V$ can be viewed as a subspace of its complexification $V^{\mathbb C}=V \otimes_{\mathbb R}C$ via the map $v \to v \otimes 1$ . Thus, we can consider in this way $\bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d$ as a subspace of $(\bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d)^{\mathbb C}=\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d.$ Now we are given an element $\omega \in \bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d$ , which is decomposable as an element in $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d$ , and we ask whether or not it is decomposable as an element in $ \bigwedge^k\mathbb{R}^d$ . What is the answer for this second variant of the question? Comment: Perhaps there is a way to view $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{C}^d$ as a subspace of $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}^d$ in a way which preserves decomposability, and the ""real copy"" $\bigwedge^k_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{R}^d$ , thus reducing the second problem to the first one. I asked about the possible existence of such an embedding here . So far, I only know that the answer is positive for $k=2$ : Let $\omega \in \bigwedge^2\mathbb{R}^d$ be decomposable in $\bigwedge^2\mathbb{C}^d$ . $\omega$ can be written as $$\omega=(u_1+iv_1) \wedge (u_2+iv_2), \tag{1}$$ where $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2 \in \mathbb R^d$ . Since $$ \omega=(u_1 \wedge u_2 - v_1 \wedge v_2)+i (v_1 \wedge u_2+u_1 \wedge v_2), $$ $\omega \in \bigwedge^2\mathbb{R}^d$ if and only if $$v_1 \wedge u_2=-u_1 \wedge v_2, \tag{2}$$ where this is an equality in $\bigwedge^2\mathbb{R}^d$ . Suppose that $\omega \in \bigwedge^2\mathbb{R}^d$ . If $\dim(\text{span}_{\mathbb R}(u_1,u_2) \cap \text{span}_{\mathbb R}(v_1,v_2)) \ge 1$ then $\omega=u_1 \wedge u_2 - v_1 \wedge v_2$ is decomposable in $\bigwedge^2\mathbb{R}^d$ .

All sources I've found agree that vectors (or rather their coordinates) transform contravariantly while covectors (linear forms) transform covariantly. However, I have a feeling that this transformation behavior is only a consequence of what one defines to be a change of basis. Let me clarify this point. Let $V$ be a vector space and $B$ a basis for $V$. For each $v \in V$ we then have a coordinate representation $[v]_B$ of $v$ with respect to the basis $B$. If we now take another Basis of $V$, say $B'$, we can find a matrix $A$, such that $A[v]_B = [v]_{B'}$. That is $A$ converts a coordinate representation with respect to the ""old"" Basis $B$ to the corresponding representation of $v$ relative to $B'$. This matrix $A$ is what I consider to be the Change-of-Basis-matrix from $B$ to $B'$. Personally, I think this is the most ""natural"" way to define it. However, it's easy to see, that (by definition) the coordinates transform with $A$, i.e. we obtain the ""new"" from the ""old"" coordinates by multiplying with $A$.

98,Maximal geodesics on compact manifolds,Maximal geodesics on compact manifolds,,"I have two questions about the following passage in Taubes's book on differential geometry. I also quote the proposition it references. 9.1 The maximal extension of a geodesic Let $I \subset R$ denote a closed interval that is not the whole of $R$, and let $s$ denote an end point of   $I$, for the sake of the discussion, the maximum point. Let $\gamma: I \rightarrow M$   denote a geodesic. It follows from Proposition 8.3 that there exists   an extension of $\gamma$ to an interval with maximal endpoint $s + \epsilon$ for some   $\epsilon > 0$. To see this, take a point $q =\gamma (s')$ for $s'$ nearly $s$. Then $q$   is very close to $p =\gamma (s)$. Proposition 8.3 tells us that the   geodesic $t \rightarrow \gamma_q(t) = \gamma(s'+ t)$ is defined for $|t|<\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$   that depends only on p. This extends $\gamma$. It follows as a consequence   that each geodesic in $M$ has a maximum extension. In particular, if $M$   is compact, then each geodesic extends as a geodesic mapping $R$ into $M$. Proposition 8.3 Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $g$ denote a Riemannian metric on $M$. Let $p\in M$ and let $v \in TM|_p$. There   exists $\epsilon>0$ and a unique map from the interval $(-\epsilon,  \epsilon)$ to $M$ that obeys the geodesic equation, sends $0$ to $p$,   and whose differential at $0$ sends the vector $d/dt$ to $v$. How is this extension argument valid? The argument claims that $\epsilon$ depends only on the endpoint of the interval $I$, but in proposition $8.3$, $\epsilon$ depends on the point $0$ is being mapped to. Here, that is $s'$. I'm lost on the details of the argument here and would appreciate any clarification you could provide. Why does it follow from the fact that geodesics have maximal extensions that geodesics on compact manifolds have extensions to all of $\mathbb R$?","I have two questions about the following passage in Taubes's book on differential geometry.

99,How to reduce cubics in the plane to a canonical form?,How to reduce cubics in the plane to a canonical form?,,"I watched a video from Wildberger in the Differential Geometry series ( first, or third lecture, I don't remember ) where he says the following. The general format of a cubic curve is  $$a x^3 + b y^3 + c x^2 y + d y^2 x + e x^2 + f y^2 + g x y + h x + i y + j = 0$$ and that all of these can be reduced ( transformed, in fact ) to the canonical form $$y^2 = a x^3 + b x + c.$$ He then explains that there are basically three types, one of them being the elliptic curve with no singularities and two others with singularities. Is this correct? And how do these transformations work? P.S. Allegedly ( says Wildberger ) Newton studied cubics intensively and categorized them in 80 different types. Is there some book where this is described? EDIT. I am studying this question which might be a duplicate.
