Let us say, that there are 5 profiles that form this ``complete set'': $T(n) = (n, n, n, n)$, $A_{-1}(n) = (n, n, n, n - 1)$ or $(n - 1, n, n, n)$, $A_{-2}(n) = (n, n, n, n - 2)$ or $(n - 2, n, n, n)$, $A_{+1}(n) = (n, n, n, n + 1)$ or $(n + 1, n, n, n)$, or $A_{+2}(n) = (n, n, n, n  + 2)$ or $(n + 2, n, n, n)$. Then, I need a system of recurrent relations for these quantities. And this is where problems start. Say, I wish to write: $$T(n) = 3 T(n - 3) + 2 \times (A_{+2}(n) + A_{+1}(n) + A_{-2}(n - 1) + A_{-1}(n - 2)).$$ In the last bracket I'm trying to count the number of transitions between profiles $A$ and $T$. But I really don't know if this set is not overfilled? How can I be sure that I don't calculate anything twice? What is the correct choice of these profiles and the correct way to write down relations between them?",,"['sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics']"

The queue for one particular ride (involving pirates) bifurcated upon entry; the two sides wound independently through a maze and emerged next to each other at the other side.  Two people nearby were debating whether both sides had the same physical length, or whether one side was shorter.  I spent lots of time in queues that day mulling over the following problem: Define an $(m,n,k)$-queue to be an $m\times n$ grid, together with $k$ disjoint paths from one of the $m$-long sides to the other, such that each grid point is contained in one path; each of the paths has the same length; the entry points are contiguous, and the exit points are contiguous. Question: What are necessary and sufficient conditions on $m$, $n$ and $k$ such that there exists an $(m,n,k)$-queue? As examples, below are pictures of $(6,6,k)$-queues for $k=1,2,3,4,6$. There are some obvious necessary conditions.  First, $k$ must divide $mn$ (and the common path length is $l=mn/k$).  Second, $k\le m$.  However, these conditions are not sufficient; for example, it's not hard to show that there is no $(8,3,4)$-queue. Some special cases are straightforward.  An $(m,n,m)$-queue trivially exists; it consists of $m$ vertical paths of length $n$ (see the $(6,6,6)$-queue in the figure above.)  An $(m,n,1)$-queue always exists; the $(6,6,1)$-queue above illustrates a ubiquitous construction.  An $(m,n,n)$-queue always exists if $n\le m$; for example, here's the canonical construction of a $(6,4,4)$-queue: Constructing larger queues from smaller queues One easy way to extend a queue is to stack one queue on top of its reflection; thus the existence of an $(m,n,k)$-queue implies the existence of a $(m,cn,k)$-queue for any integer $c>0$. Here's a more interesting construction.  In an $(m,n,k)$-queue with $k|m$, there's a possibility that some horizontal line in the grid is crossed exactly $m/k$ times by each of the $k$ paths. (This happens, for example, in the pictured $(6,6,2)$-queue; both paths intersect the line below the top line three times.)  In this case you can insert an extra row at this line, extending all $k$ paths vertically to get an $(m,n+1,k)$-queue: Iterating, this proves the existence of a $(6,n,2)$-queue for all $n\ge 6$.  (If you've been to the Haunted Mansion, this construction will look familiar!) You can also extend horizontally (if $k|n$ and every path intersects a vertical line $n/k$ times) to get an $(m+1,n,k)$-queue. Remarks The contiguousness requirement was motivated by observation of actual queues.  However, the problem seems trivial if that requirement is dropped; in that case, the necessary conditions $k|mn$ and $k\le m$ are also sufficient. Observe that there are some parity consequences of the bipartiteness of the grid.  If $l$ is odd, the paths connect points of the same color in a ""checkerboard"" coloring of the grid, otherwise paths connect points of opposite color.  If $mn$ is odd, then there's a ""majority color""; the line of entry points (and the line of exit points) must begin and end with that majority color. By connecting the first exit point to the second exit point, reversing direction and so on, the problem can be viewed as asking whether there is a Hamiltonian path in the grid with additional structure.  This led to some interesting references but no solution. There are plenty of related problems here, such as the problem of counting queues.

38,Expectation of longest monotonic segment of a permutation,Expectation of longest monotonic segment of a permutation,,"Consider for any $p \in P(n)$, the permutation group of order $n$, the function  $L(p)$ defined as the length of the longest monotonic segment in $p$.

For example, with $n=6$, $$ L(p= [2,1,4,5,3,6]) = 3 $$ based on the segment $(1,4,5)$. In particular, I would like to be able to compute or understand the asymptotic behavior of the expectation value of $L(p)$, defined as  $$ E(n) = \sum_{k} k \frac{N_L (n,k)}{n!} $$ Note that longest increasing segment is different than the longest increasing subsequence , which has been shown to have an expectation value asymptoptic to $2\sqrt{n}$ (see MSE question 347072).  For the example permutation above, the longest increasing subsequence is of length 4  $(1,4,5,6)$. Work I have tried A hand-waving argument hints that the asymptotic behavior is going to go as some constant times $\log(n)$.  Namely, when you try to extend $k$ to $k+1$ you have roughly a 50% chance of failing, so for the typical maximal monotonic length to increase by one, the size of the permutation would have to double. If $A(n.k)$ is the number of permutations of length $n$ containing a monotonic segment of length at least $k$, then you can try to relate $A(n,k)$ to $A(n-1,k)$ as follows: Choose any number from $1$ to $n$ as the first number.  Then do an order-preserving map of the remaining $n-1$ numbers to $\{1, \ldots, n-1\}$.  $A(n-1,k)$ of the resulting permutations will have a monotonic segment of length at least $k$, meaning that for those, the full permutation will also have such a segment.  So  $$ A(n,k) = nA(n-1,k) + \sum_r B(n,r,k)$$ where  $B(n,r,k)$ is the number of permutations of length $n$ that start with a monotonic segment of length precisely $k-1$, beginning with $r$, and that contain no monotonic segment of length greater than of equal to $k$ (to avoid double counting.

50,Sums and differences of a set of numbers,Sums and differences of a set of numbers,,"I am trying to prove that, given a set of $25$ positive numbers, it is always possible to choose a pair of them such that none of the other numbers equals either their sum or their difference. For instance, if you take the set to be the numbers from $1$ to $25$, taking $12$ and $24$ will give a sum of $36$ which is not in the set, and a difference of $12$ which is not a different element of the set than the two chosen. I feel like the proof of this is a lot simpler than I am making it. So far I have split the situation into two cases, being able to generalise for evenly spaced numbers by simply suggesting the first element chosen be a number $y \in S$ such that $2ny \in S$ but $3ny \notin S$, where $n$ is the space between each number. Thus these two elements will always give a sum outside of the set and difference of $y$. However, this does not help at all for a random group of numbers and I feel there is a better argument that covers both cases. Considering the problem as a counting argument, I have determined that there are $300$ possible pairs within the set of $25$ numbers. If I can show that there are more pairs than possible sums and differences within the set, I am done. I have considered using a system of triples to express this, i.e. a subset of three elements $\{x_i,x_j,x_k\}$ of $S$ such that $x_i+x_j=x_k$. Thus each triple will give the sum of a pair and the difference of two pairs. However, counting the number of triples becomes difficult. I considered tackling this by counting the number of 'statements' created by each, i.e. sum or difference created by the pairs and triples. Each pair $(a,b)$ would give me a sum and a difference $a+b=c, a-b=d$ for $a,b \in S$ but $c,d$ not necessarily in $S$. Each triple gives me a sum and two differences $x_i+x_j=x_k, x_k-x_i=x_j, x_k-x_j=x_i$ for $x_i,x_j,x_k \in S$. Thus I figure this simplifies the proof into showing that there are more sums and differences created by the pairs than by the triples. Then I just want to show that $300\cdot 2 \geq |T|\cdot3$, where $T$ is the set of triples. Thus $|T| \leq200$. But then again, this doesn't ensure a single pair has neither its sum nor difference within the set, only that at least one pair has one of its sum or difference outside of the set. Argh! The circles begin! Now I am completely stuck. How do I go about proving that the number of triples is below a certain number? Am I going about this in the wrong direction? Have I oversimplified the problem?

If I can show that there are more pairs than possible sums and differences within the set, I am done. I have considered using a system of triples to express this, i.e. a subset of three elements $\{x_i,x_j,x_k\}$ of $S$ such that $x_i+x_j=x_k$. Thus each triple will give the sum of a pair and the difference of two pairs. However, counting the number of triples becomes difficult. I considered tackling this by counting the number of 'statements' created by each, i.e. sum or difference created by the pairs and triples. Each pair $(a,b)$ would give me a sum and a difference $a+b=c, a-b=d$ for $a,b \in S$ but $c,d$ not necessarily in $S$. Each triple gives me a sum and two differences $x_i+x_j=x_k, x_k-x_i=x_j, x_k-x_j=x_i$ for $x_i,x_j,x_k \in S$. Thus I figure this simplifies the proof into showing that there are more sums and differences created by the pairs than by the triples. Then I just want to show that $300\cdot 2 \geq |T|\cdot3$, where $T$ is the set of triples. Thus $|T| \leq200$. But then again, this doesn't ensure a single pair has neither its sum nor difference within the set, only that at least one pair has one of its sum or difference outside of the set. Argh! The circles begin! Now I am completely stuck. How do I go about proving that the number of triples is below a certain number? Am I going about this in the wrong direction? Have I oversimplified the problem? Any help at all is much appreciated!",,['combinatorics']

Briefly, the original question asks, ""Given $k$ points on a circle, if each point is connected to every other by a chord, what is the maximum number of regions $R$ these points divide the circle into?"" The answer has a neat little formula and a straightforward combinatorial interpretation: $$R= {k\choose 0} + {k \choose 2} + {k \choose 4}$$ where ${k\choose 0}=1$ is the number of original regions, ${k\choose 2}$ is the number of lines, and ${k\choose 4}$ is the number of intersections of lines (this assumes the arrangement of points is not degenerate, so to speak). The natural generalization is: Given $k$ points on an $n$-sphere, each subset of cardinality $n+1$ determines a hyperplane in $(n+1)$-space. What is the maximum number of regions these hyperplanes divide the sphere into? In my estimation this is a much harder problem.  One complication has to do with the special nature of a maximal solution.  In the 1-sphere case, the arrangements of points which produce non-maximal regions have measure zero in the space of all arrangements (this can be made precise).  In higher dimensions the situation is more or less reversed. Maximal arrangements, while probably not constituting a null set, are very unlikely.  An arbitrary hyperplane arrangement will divide up the space into a predictable number of regions, but many of these regions don't intersect with the sphere at all, and the question of which do and which don't is sensitive to the specific constellation of points.

Do the same but with $\{1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4\}$. Show that this cannot be done for $\{1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5\}$. The first two are rather simple and it just requires playing around with different arrangements. The unique (up to reflection) solution for the first is given by $312132$, and for the second we have $41312432$. The third question is interesting because it has the following elegant (non brute-forced) solution. Proof . Assign the value of the position of each element to that element. So for example if $x_3$ is the leftmost $3$-element and it is found in the second position then set $x_3=2$. We note that if $x_k=a$, then the rightmost $k$-element $y_k$ will be $k+1$ positions to the right and so $y_k=a+k+1$.

For example, prepending $1^n0$ to a number of string length $n$ is one such scheme that requires $2 * n + 1$ characters to represent a number of length $n$. A better solution is the following: $f(x) = 1^{string\_length(g(x))}0g(x)00x$, where $g(x)$ is an encoding of the length of $x$ that avoids the number pattern $00$. Such a $g$ can be constructed as a bitset encoding of set of Fibonacci numbers that is not missing more than one consecutive Fibonacci number where the sum of the numbers in the set is equal to the string length of $x$. With this definition, $g(x)$ will have at most $log_\phi(string\_length(x))$ characters, so the total encoding of a number of length $n$ will require no more than $n + 2 * \log_\phi n + 3$ characters. This process can be iterated one or more times to achieve a bound of $n + \log_\phi n + o(\log_\phi n)$. As a further optimization, we can avoid the intervening zeros and increase the base of the $\log$ by deducing the length of the prepended padding.

An example of this is Sperner's Theorem for antichains, visualised by drawing chains on the $n$ -cube. I've already seen one probabilistic proof, which is elegant but I cannot visualise it. Proof For $n=1$ it is trivial as $I= \lbrace 1 \rbrace$ . We remove an element $x\in [n]$ from the construction to achieve a construction with $n-1$ , which we can induct on. For each $x \in \lbrace 1,...,n \rbrace$ let $I_x= \lbrace i\in I: x \notin R_i \rbrace$ , and $S_i^x = S_i \setminus \lbrace x \rbrace$ . $\lbrace (R_i, S_i^x, i \in I_x \rbrace$ we cannot have $R_i \cap S^x_j = \emptyset$ , as if $x$ was the only element in common between $R_i$ and $S_j$ , that $R_i$ was thrown out as it contained $x$ . Anyway, $$\sum_{i \in I_x} \frac{1}{{{r_i+s^x_i}\choose{s^x_i}}}\le 1.$$ Let us vary $x$ , and fix $i, R_i, S_i$ . Given each $i \in I$ , $i \in I_x$ (i.e. $x \notin R_i$ ) for $n-r_i$ values of $x$ . Now, if $i \in I_x$ ( $x \notin R_i$ ), then for $s_i$ values of $x$ we have $s^x_i=s_i-1$ (i.e. $x \in S_i$ ), and for $n-r_i-s_i$ values of $x$ we have $s_i^x=s_i$ . Hence $$n \ge \sum_{x \in [n]} \sum_{i \in I_x}\frac{1}{{{r_i+s^x_i}\choose{s^x_i}}}= \sum_{i \in I} \frac{n-r_i-s_i}{{{r_i+s_i}\choose{s_i}}}+\frac{s_i}{{{r_i+s_i-1}\choose{s_i-1}}}$$ $$n \ge \sum_{i \in I} \frac{(n-r_i-s_i)(s_i)!

EDIT 2:  Aftr some brute force calculation, it appears that I have a series generated, that looks like $$b(n,j)=\sum_{k=0}^j(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}S(n-k,j-k)$$ $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b(n,j)x^n=b(0,j)+b(1,j)+b(2,j)+b(3,j)+b(4,j)+...$$ Now $$b(0,j)=1$$ $$b(1,j)=S(1,j)$$ $$b(2,j)=S(2,j)-2S(1,j-1)$$ $$b(3,j)=S(3,j)-3S(2,j-1)$$ $$b(4,j)=S(4,j)-4S(3,j-1)+6S(2,j-2)$$ $$b(5,j)=S(5,j)-5S(4,j-1)+10S(3,j-2)$$ $$b(6,j)=S(6,j)-6S(5,j-1)+15S(4,j-2)-20(3,j-3)$$ $$b(7,j)=S(7,j)-7S(6,j-1)+21S(5,j-2)-35(4,j-3)$$ $$... $$ Rearranging I can see that I have $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b(n,j)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty S(n,j)x^n-\sum_{n=1}^\infty nS(n-1,j-1)x^n+\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}S(n-2,j-2)x^n-\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}S(n-3,j-3)x^n+...$$ And it looks like a derivative is taking effect but my powers of $x$ are not changing, but it also looks like I'm running in circles.  I feel like my bounds are incorrect...Should, for example, I change $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty nS(n-1,j-1)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)S(n,j-1)x^{n+1}$$ $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}S(n-2,j-2)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2!}S(n,j-2)x^{n+2}$$ Any suggestions? EDIT 3:  By comparing the first few numbers given $j$ values 2,3,4, there seems to be a trend, the generating function is structured  $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b(n,j)x^n=\frac{f(x)}{\prod_{k=1}^{j}(1-kx)^{j-k+1}}$$ The degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator in the cases where $j=2,3,4$ and the ratios of degree(numerator) to degree(denominator) for $j=2,3,4$ are $$\frac{4}{3}, \frac{9}{6}, \frac{14}{10}$$ EDIT 4:  I found a paper that gives me an exponential generating function of the form: $$\sum_{n,k\ge 1}b(n,k)u^k\frac{t^n}{n!}=\exp{(u\exp{(1-Q(2,t)}})$$ where $Q(2,t)=\frac{\Gamma(2,t)}{\Gamma(2)}$ I found the paper, and never wrote down the author or journal.

If $n=10$ then we have $1$ cycle with length 10, so sign of permutation is equal $(-1)^{10-1}=-1$. $\left(\begin{array}{cccccccccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\\ 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 9  \end{array}\right)= \left(\begin{array}{cccccccccc}1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 5 & 10 & 9 & 7 & 3 & 6 \end{array}\right)$ If I'd like to count inversions then I have this table $\begin{array}{ccccc} (2,1)\\ (4,1) & (4,3)\\ (6,1) & (6,3) & (6,5)\\ (8,1) & (8,3) & (8,5) & (8,7)\\ (10,1) & (10,3) & (10,5) & (10,7) & (10,9) \end{array}$ There is $\sum_{i=1}^{5}i=\frac{6\cdot 5}{2}=15$ inversions and sign of permutation is equal again $(-1)^{15}=-1$. For generalized form and even $n$ the last of row in this table has form: $(n,1)(n,3),\cdots,(n,n-1)$ Quantity of braces is equal $\frac{n}{2}$. Now we can count inversions $\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}}i=\frac{\left(1+\frac{n}{2}\right)\frac{n}{2}}{2}=\frac{(n+2)n}{8}$ If $n$ is odd, then end of permutation has column $\begin{array}{c}n\\n\end{array}$.

Background: In the field of Mechanical engineering, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) sometimes requires a 3D mesh of connected triangular elements to represent the geometry of e.g. machine components. However, these meshes may not always be 'watertight' or accidentally contain more that one component where a single component is expected, etcetera.

I can transform this problem into a problem of putting squares with matching borders in the rectangle. Say I color the bottom and left sides of the rectangle yellow (and keep the top and right side white). Then, hamiltonian loops correspond to tilings of the rectangle with the following tiles, while keeping matching borders between tiles If I fix one dimension of the rectangle (say $m$), one can compute the number of matching tilings by computing a particular coefficient of the $n$-th power of a square matrix of size $5^m$ $A_m$ : let $I_m$ be the set of sequences $s$ of length $m$ of vertical colors. Consider $V = \Bbb Z^{I_m}$ and let $A \in End(V)$ be the matrix such that $A_{s,t}$ is the number of ways to have a column of $m$ tiles, with yellow on the bottow, white at the top, whose left border is $s$ and whose right border is $t$. Then $N(m,n) = (A^n)_{yellow,white}$ counts the number of hamiltonian loops in the rectangle $n \times m$. Computing the eigenvalues of $A$, we learn about the asymptotic behaviour of $N(m,n)$ for large $n$. For example if the eigenvalue with greatest modulus $\lambda_m$ is real and positive then $N(m,n) \sim C_m \lambda_m^n$. Can we say anything about the asymptotic behaviour for large $n$ and $m$ ? Because we originally use $6$ tiles, we obviously have $N(m,n) \le 6^{nm}$, so the set $\{|\lambda_m|^{1/m}\}$ has a $\limsup$ $\lambda \le 6$.
