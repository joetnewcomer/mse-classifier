13,What is the definition of a group entirely in first-order predicate logic?,What is the definition of a group entirely in first-order predicate logic?,,"I've seen the definition of a group in many different books given as follows: A group is a nonempty set $G$ and a binary operation $*$, denoted by $(G,*)$ that satisfies the following properties: For every $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $G$, $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$; There exists $e$ in $G$ such that for every $a$ in $G$, $a*e=a$; For every $a$ in $G$, there exists $b$ in $G$ such that $a*b=e$. I would just like to clean this up and put it in predicate logic properly.  I have not seen this done in any book.  When I try to do this myself, I feel like I'm opening Pandora's box!  Here is how I have reasoned about this important definition: Let $G$ be any nonempty set and form the set containing $G$ as the only element, $\{G\}$.  Now let $*$ be set of all functions from $G\times G$ to $G$, so $*=\{\text{all functions } G\times G\rightarrow G\}$.  Next, we take the Cartesian product of $\{G\} \times * = \{ (G,*_1), (G,*_2), (G,*_3),\dots\}$.  So, basically we have set of ordered pairs where each ordered pair consists of a set and a function.  It seems that we are interested in whether or not each ordered pair satisfies the above properties.  Actually, it seems that for a particular ordered pair $(G, *_n)$ to be a group, it would only be dependent upon how the function is defined.  Depending on the cardinality of $G$, there are many functions from $G\times G\rightarrow G$, and we know that not all of these would be groups, nevertheless, it seems that $(G,*)$ is group if $*$ satisfies the above properties. So, I've tried to formulate the law of associativity using only ordered pairs.  Here is what I have come up with: For every $a$, $b$, $c$, $x$, $y$, $z$ in $G$ ($*$ is associative iff [$((a,b),x)$ in $*$ and $((x,c),y)$ in $*$ iff $((b,c),z)$ in $*$ and $((a,z),y)$ in $*$]) I know this looks ugly, but since $*$ is really just a set of ordered pairs where the first coordinate is also an ordered pair, I tried to translate For every $a$, $b$, $c$ in $G$, $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$ strictly into a statement with ordered pairs. Anyway, I'm not sure about this formulation.  For example, when we want to test if a relation $R$, on $S\times S$ is symmetric, we say for every $a$, $b$ in $S$, $R$ is symmetric iff $(a,b)$ in $R$ implies $(b,a)$ in R.  The difference is technically $*$ is a relation on $(G\times G)\times G$ and to test for associativity I said for every $a$, $b$, $c$, $x$, $y$, $z$ in $G$.  Can I do this since for symmetry, $R$ was a relation on $S\times S$  where the two sets are equal.  On $(G\times G)\times G$ the two sets are not equal, so I don't know if this is correct. Besides the issue with associativity, I'm not sure how to formulate the last two rules of groups in predicate logic and also I think we should include something about closure, perhaps.

Then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if $H$ is closed     under the operation of $G$. I have the following questions: 1. It suffices to show that $H$ contains inverses. I don't understand why that alone is sufficient. 2. Choose any $a$ in $G$...then consider the sequence $a,a^2,..$ This sequence is contained in $H$ by the closure property. I know that if $G$ is a group, then $ab$ is in $G$ for all $a$ and $b$ in $G$.But, I don't understand why the sequence has to be contained in $H$ by the closure property. 3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, since $H$ is finite, there are distinct $i,j$ such that $a^i=a^j$. I understand the Pigeonhole Principle (as explained on page 2) and why $H$ is finite, but I don't understand how the Pigeonhole Principle was applied to arrive at $a^i=a^j$. 4.

Why is it like this?,"\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}","The $4$th edition of Ian Stewart's Galois Theory is what I am looking at where there is an example stated in the following manner Let the field extension be  $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}$. We have previously seen that $t^2-5$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$. Similarly, $t^2-2$ i irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$ and $t^2-3$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{5})$. Thus there are three automorphisms of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$ which are, \begin{equation} \begin{split} \rho_1:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow -\sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow \sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow \sqrt{5}\\ \rho_2:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow -\sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow \sqrt{5}\\ \rho_3:& \sqrt{2} \rightarrow \sqrt{2} \text{ , }\sqrt{3} \rightarrow \sqrt{3} \text{ , } \sqrt{5} \rightarrow -\sqrt{5} \end{split} \end{equation} It is easy to see that the maps commute so it generates the group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2 $. Okay, my question. $1.$ First, what are the elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$? Tower law leads me to say the degree of extension $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}]=8$. So, there are $8$ elements as bases, yes? I have found these to be $\beta=\{1,\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5},\sqrt{6},\sqrt{10},\sqrt{15},\sqrt{30}\}$. Now, all $\rho$ up there, seem only to care about $\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}$.Since we are looking for $\mathbb{Q}$-automorphisms over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$, sure $\rho$ will not touch on any rationals. But why do they ignore, say a map like $\sqrt{30} \rightarrow -\sqrt{30}$(while all other radicals are mapped to itself for instance). SHouldn't we consider ""all"" automorphisms like $\rho$? Then surely there are more than just $3$? $2.$ And okay, say you managed to convince me that there are only those $3$ $\rho$s up there. But the next confusion is, how do these generate $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2 $? If I understand the notation correctly, $\mathbb{Z}_2 =\{e,x\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $x$ is some non-identity. Commonly, I see it as $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{\bar{0},\bar{1}\}$. Then, taking direct products should give me a set of $3$-tuples $\{(a,b,c): a,b,c \in \mathbb{Z}_2=\{\bar{0},\bar{1}\}\}$ so something like $(\bar{0},\bar{1},\bar{1})$ etc. I believe there are $8$ distinct such t$3$-tuples. My understanding from the example is that the Galois Group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}):\mathbb{Q}$ is $\{id, \rho_1,\rho_2,\rho_3\}$ so $4$ elements. How is this going to generate $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2  \times \mathbb{Z}_2$? I am very well confused. Overall, I am only starting to learn all of this so my experience is very limited. I may be confusing some mathematical concept with another(afterall, math does jump from one and another definition ""depending on the context"") or simply misunderstanding an idea, notion, theorem whatever.
