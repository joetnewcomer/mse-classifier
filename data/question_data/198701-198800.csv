1,Parallel transport in discrete differential geometry - programming a game,Parallel transport in discrete differential geometry - programming a game,,"I would like to get a better intuitive grip on how parallel transport works. I once saw a video a German guy made with a little car having a gyroscope. That car was dragged on a big beach ball and the wheels moved. Simultaneously, a small arrow on top of that car was ""parallel transported"" via the modified gyro mechanism. What I aim to construct is an algorithm that doesn't make use of any parametric equations, nor of the Christoffel Symbols, connections, etc. on manifolds as they'd introduce a vicious circle. I'd like to start with a discrete polyhedral manifold and move an object that ""lives"" in the tangent space of that manifold along a given curve. This may sound too general, so, for starters, consider a smooth manifold, that's not discrete as I initially proposed. Say my entity is at a point A on that manifold on knows that it has to hold an arrow/vector in a given direction while moving towards another point B . A and B are connected via a very small curve. If v was the direction in A , how would it look like when it reaches B ? That's the goal of the algorithm. So, to rephrase the question, how can one know how to rotate and translate the tangent space from A to B if the displacement is small, but it does actually take place on a portion of a manifold, not in the normal Euclidian space? In case of a sphere, there is no theoretical notion of ""keep the arrow pointing towards the East"" - due to the Hairy ball theorem.. but all intuitive explanations of parallel transport do make use of such a notion, a notion of keeping a vector pointing in a certain ""constant"" direction. That ""constant"" direction is a notion that makes sense only when referring to what happens in the tangent space at a point, right? So, how would one correctly approach this: a small vehicle on a manifold, in a virtual/game environment. The vehicle moves (and it has wheels! - these might help gather rotation/distortion/etc information from the curved manifold it lies on). On top of the vehicle, a vector should me moved like it was parallel transported. To cut it short, please analyze the already classic applet .

Let $\mathbb{Q}$ be a smooth $n$ -manifold and $q=(q^1,\dots,q^n):Q\to \mathbb{R}^n$ some local coordinates on some region $Q\subseteq\mathbb{Q}$ . For this question, I will denote the associated $q^i$ basis vector fields as $\mathbf{e}_i\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{Q})$ with dual 1-form fields $\pmb{\epsilon}^i\in\Omega^1(\mathbb{Q})$ .  We may write (locally) any $\mathbf{u}\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{Q})$ in this basis in the usual way: $\mathbf{u}= \pmb{\epsilon}^i(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{e}_i = u^i\mathbf{e}_i$ . Rather than $\mathbf{e}_i$ , many sources would instead write $\partial_i$ or $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ . I get that, as a differential operator acting on functions, we have $\mathbf{u}[f] = \mathbf{d}f(\mathbf{u}) = u^i\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} f$ . This is then often used to justify writing $\mathbf{u}$ itself as $u^i\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ and this is what confuses me. In the expression $u^i\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbb{Q})$ ,  the role of $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ is not confusing to me; I view it as the ""standard"" partial derivative in essentially the same way that any undergraduate student would view it in intro calculus. But I do not understand what type of object $u^i\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ itself is supposed to be. my question: If $\mathbf{u}=u^i\mathbf{e}_i\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{Q})$ is the actual tensor (expressed in a particular basis), is it accurate to write $\mathbf{u}=u^i\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ ? If so, this implies $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i} = \mathbf{e}_i \in \mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{Q})$ are the exact same object?  Or, is the use of $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ as a basis vector merely a slight abuse of notation alluding to the fact that $\mathbf{e}_i[f] = \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}f$ ? In other words, if I insist on reserving the notation $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ for the ""standard"" partial derivative one encounters in basic calculus, is this same object also literally a vector field on the domain of the function $q^i$ ? Or, instead, does there exist some vector field $\mathbf{e}_i\in\mathfrak{X}(\mathbb{Q})$ on the domain of the coordinate $q^i$ whose action on a function is given by $\mathbf{e}_i[f] = \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}f$ , but where $\mathbf{e}_i$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}$ are not literally the same object?","I have gotten comfortable working with coordinate bases but I still do not fully understand them.

48,Practical aspect of diffeomorphisms,Practical aspect of diffeomorphisms,,"I've been trying to learn differential geometry (for awhile now), and one thing that has confused me a little is what it means from a practical perspective to have a diffeomorphism between two manifolds. I understand the basic concept of equivalence: for instance, in algebra, when I hear: ""These two groups are isomorphic,"" I have no problem thinking of them as exactly the same thing up to a (superficial) renaming of the elements. And in topology, when I hear: ""These two spaces are homeomorphic,"" I have no problem visualizing one space to be exactly the same as the other up to some (superficial) stretching or twisting. However, in differential geometry, when I hear: ""These manifolds are diffoemorphic,"" I'm not really sure how to think about them and the situation seems less straightforward to me. Maybe this is because I'm associating a lot of additional things to a manifold which do not come purely from it's smooth structure. At the same time, given two diffoemorphic manifolds, assuming one of them has some additional structures (e.g., tensor field, differential form, complex structure), then the other manifold also carries corresponding structures induced from the diffeomorphism. To be more specific, let's say $M$ and $N$ are two manifolds that are diffeomorphic ($\phi: M \rightarrow N$) to one another.

(this is because the tangent and cotangent bundles, and all tensor products of these are also diffeomorphic/isomorphic). e.g. 1) If $h$ is a metric on $N$, $g = h \circ d\phi$ is a metric on $M$. 2) If $J$ is a complex structure on $N$, $J' = d\phi^{-1} \circ J \circ d \phi$ is a complex structure on $M$. 3) If $g$ and $h$ are as from 1), then $\int_N dV_h = \int_M dV_g$. 4) Any curvature at a point $p \in M$ will be equal to the same curvature at the corresponding point $\phi(p)\in N$. Is this correct/does this capture the essence of what it means to be diffeomorphic? Is it even necessary to refer back to $M$? Or in practice once you have a diffeomorphism can you just work on $N$ and the fact that everything carries over to $M$ is obvious/implicit? Are there other or better ways to think about diffeomorphism?","I've been trying to learn differential geometry (for awhile now), and one thing that has confused me a little is what it means from a practical perspective to have a diffeomorphism between two manifolds. I understand the basic concept of equivalence: for instance, in algebra, when I hear: ""These two groups are isomorphic,"" I have no problem thinking of them as exactly the same thing up to a (superficial) renaming of the elements. And in topology, when I hear: ""These two spaces are homeomorphic,"" I have no problem visualizing one space to be exactly the same as the other up to some (superficial) stretching or twisting. However, in differential geometry, when I hear: ""These manifolds are diffoemorphic,"" I'm not really sure how to think about them and the situation seems less straightforward to me. Maybe this is because I'm associating a lot of additional things to a manifold which do not come purely from it's smooth structure. At the same time, given two diffoemorphic manifolds, assuming one of them has some additional structures (e.g., tensor field, differential form, complex structure), then the other manifold also carries corresponding structures induced from the diffeomorphism.

97,Proving Wikipedia's formula on interior product of commutator of vector fields,Proving Wikipedia's formula on interior product of commutator of vector fields,,"During one of my daily exercises, I was looking for properties of the elements of Cartan calculus. I stumbled on Wikipedia's page about interior products (here) , and I've noticed a property that sounds very useful: $$ \iota_{[X,Y]}\omega=[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\omega. $$ In Wikipedia's notations, $\iota$ is the interior product, $\mathcal L_X$ is the Lie derivative with respect to the vector field $X$ (and $X$ and $Y$ are vector fields). $\omega$ is a differential form on a manifold $M$. As there is no source given, I'm trying to prove this equality, and failing due to a sign. Maybe I'm doing some stupid error somewhere. My attempt so far follows. First: I note that the operator on the right has the property $$ [\mathcal L_X,\iota _Y](\omega\wedge\eta)=[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\omega\wedge\eta+(-1)^k\omega\wedge[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\eta, $$ where $\omega$ is assumed to be a $k-$form, and $\eta$ is an arbitrary form. This is the same interaction with wedge product as the left hand side. It follows that I can decide the value of the right hand side locally, where I can expand any form as tensor product of the basis forms. Hence, if I prove that the equality holds for $0-$ and $1-$forms, I'm done. I start with $0-$forms: I take a function $f$ from $M$ to the field, and compute left and right hand side. Well, ""compute"": the left hand side is the application of an inner product to a function, that is zero by definition, while on the right hand side I either have a contraction first, annulling $f$, or I have a Lie derivative acting first. The Lie derivative of a function is a function, so it follows that $\iota_Y\mathcal L f=0$, and I'm done for this case. For $1-$forms: let $\alpha$ be such an $1-$form. The left hand side is $$ \iota_{[X,Y]}\alpha=\alpha([X,Y]). $$ I split the calculation of the right hand side in two, and use Cartan's formula $\mathcal L_X=d\iota_X+\iota_Xd$ whenever necessary. Lie derivatives are ugly, all hail Cartan. $$ \mathcal L_X\iota_Y\alpha=\mathcal L_X(\alpha (Y))=X(\alpha(Y)),\\ \iota_Y\mathcal L_X\alpha=\iota_Yd\iota_X\alpha+\iota_Y\iota_Xd\alpha=Y(\alpha(X))+\underline{d\alpha(Y,X)}. $$ Underlined for your convenience is the step in which it is most likely I've done an error, but I fail to see why. I state that $\iota_Y\iota_Xd\alpha=d\alpha(Y,X)$ as I am applying $X$ first, and $Y$ second, and $\iota$ places vectors at the beginning of a string. Is it correct? Was I stupid here?

Lie has done many wonderful things, and an orrible derivative)","During one of my daily exercises, I was looking for properties of the elements of Cartan calculus. I stumbled on Wikipedia's page about interior products (here) , and I've noticed a property that sounds very useful: $$ \iota_{[X,Y]}\omega=[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\omega. $$ In Wikipedia's notations, $\iota$ is the interior product, $\mathcal L_X$ is the Lie derivative with respect to the vector field $X$ (and $X$ and $Y$ are vector fields). $\omega$ is a differential form on a manifold $M$. As there is no source given, I'm trying to prove this equality, and failing due to a sign. Maybe I'm doing some stupid error somewhere. My attempt so far follows. First: I note that the operator on the right has the property $$ [\mathcal L_X,\iota _Y](\omega\wedge\eta)=[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\omega\wedge\eta+(-1)^k\omega\wedge[\mathcal L_X,\iota_Y]\eta, $$ where $\omega$ is assumed to be a $k-$form, and $\eta$ is an arbitrary form. This is the same interaction with wedge product as the left hand side. It follows that I can decide the value of the right hand side locally, where I can expand any form as tensor product of the basis forms. Hence, if I prove that the equality holds for $0-$ and $1-$forms, I'm done. I start with $0-$forms: I take a function $f$ from $M$ to the field, and compute left and right hand side. Well, ""compute"": the left hand side is the application of an inner product to a function, that is zero by definition, while on the right hand side I either have a contraction first, annulling $f$, or I have a Lie derivative acting first. The Lie derivative of a function is a function, so it follows that $\iota_Y\mathcal L f=0$, and I'm done for this case. For $1-$forms: let $\alpha$ be such an $1-$form. The left hand side is $$ \iota_{[X,Y]}\alpha=\alpha([X,Y]). $$ I split the calculation of the right hand side in two, and use Cartan's formula $\mathcal L_X=d\iota_X+\iota_Xd$ whenever necessary. Lie derivatives are ugly, all hail Cartan. $$ \mathcal L_X\iota_Y\alpha=\mathcal L_X(\alpha (Y))=X(\alpha(Y)),\\ \iota_Y\mathcal L_X\alpha=\iota_Yd\iota_X\alpha+\iota_Y\iota_Xd\alpha=Y(\alpha(X))+\underline{d\alpha(Y,X)}. $$ Underlined for your convenience is the step in which it is most likely I've done an error, but I fail to see why. I state that $\iota_Y\iota_Xd\alpha=d\alpha(Y,X)$ as I am applying $X$ first, and $Y$ second, and $\iota$ places vectors at the beginning of a string. Is it correct? Was I stupid here?
