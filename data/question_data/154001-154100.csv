2,Differences of Prime Numbers,Differences of Prime Numbers,,"Let $a<b<c$ be primes such that $c-a$, $c-b$, and $b-a$ are also prime. It is rather simple to show that $(2,5,7)$ is the only triple that satisfies these conditions: Proof Sketch: The case $a>2$ reduces to a system of equations with no solution after realizing that each difference must be equal to $2$. The case $a=2$ reduces to the existence of a prime $p$ such that $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime. The only such tuple is $p=3\rightarrow (3,5,7)$. A modular argument takes care of uniqueness. The tuple $(a,b,c)=(2,5,7)$ follows from $p=3$. I was wondering if there is a more elegant approach utilizing many number theoretic tools (i.e. elliptic curves, algebraic number theory, ect.)? I realize that this is entirely unnecessary as we can appeal to the most atomic of theory to solve this problem; however, I don't spend much time with number theory and was looking for some application of ""modern techniques"".","Let $a<b<c$ be primes such that $c-a$, $c-b$, and $b-a$ are also prime.

3,Numbers represented by a cubic form,Numbers represented by a cubic form,,"EDIT, April 11, 2013: See answer at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/127160/numbers-integrally-represented-by-a-ternary-cubic-form/127295#127295 This is part 2 ( of 25 discriminants of class number exactly three) of primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form I think two will be enough. Given integers $a,b,c,$ and cubic form $$ f(a,b,c) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a^2 b  - a b^2 + 3 a^2 c - a c^2  + b^2 c - b c^2  - 4 a b c $$ $$ f(a,b,c) = \det  \left(  \begin{array}{ccc}   a  &  b & c  \\   c & a + c & b + c \\    b + c   &  b + 2 c  & a + b + 2 c \end{array}    \right)  .  $$  what primes $p$ can be integrally represented as $$  p = f(a,b,c)? $$ I think it is  all primes $(p| 11) = -1 ,$ and all $p = u^2 + 11 v^2$ in integers, but not any $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2.$  Note that, if $-p$ is represented, so is $p.$ I also suspect that if  prime $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2$ and $f(a,b,c) \equiv 0 \pmod q,$  then all three $a,b,c \equiv 0 \pmod q,$ and  $f(a,b,c) \equiv 0 \pmod {q^3}.$ Note that if $f$ integrally represents both $m,n$ then it represents $mn.$ That is because $f(a,b,c) = \det(aI + b X + c X^2),$ where $$ X =  \left(  \begin{array}{ccc}   0  &  1 & 0  \\   0 & 0 & 1 \\    1  &  1  & 1 \end{array}    \right)    $$ Then $X^3 = X^2 + X + I$ and $X^4 = 2 X^2 + 2 X + I.$ If all suspicions are correct, we can correctly describe all numbers integrally represented by this polynomial: positive or negative are unimportant, most prime factors are unimportant, all that matters is that every exponent of a prime factor $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2$ must be divisible by 3.

7,Does Chaitin's constant have infinitely many prime prefixes?,Does Chaitin's constant have infinitely many prime prefixes?,,"Define $f(n) = \lfloor 2^n \cdot \Omega \rfloor$, that is, $f(n)$ is the first $n$ bits of Chaitin's constant interpreted as a number written in binary. I am trying to figure out if $f(n)$ can have infinitely many prime values.  To show that it cannot, it would suffice to find a way of compressing these prime values to descriptions arbitrarily shorter than $ \log_2{p}$ bits.  This seems to be a tricky task as it runs up against the edge cases of the definitions. Let $L(x) = \lfloor \log_2{x} \rfloor + 1$.  Any number $n$ can be encoded in a prefix-free fashion by first emitting the length of the length of its length in unary, then the length of its length in binary, then its length in binary, then the number itself in binary.  This uses $2 \cdot L(L(L(n))) + L(L(n)) + L(n)$ bits. If we have a prime number $p$, we can improve on this by encoding its index $\pi(p)$, and decoding it with a program that finds the $\pi(p)^{th}$ prime.  By the prime number theorem, we save $L(L(p)) + O(1)$ bits this way.  But the pesky $2 \cdot L(L(L(p)))$ term remains. There is more information we can take advantage of: the $k^{th}$ prime prefix of $\Omega$ is a special type of prime, because it itself has $k-1$ prime prefixes.  So we can count only those primes when decoding it, and heuristically this gives an encoding of size $2 \cdot L(L(L(p))) + L(p) - O(k)$ bits.  Or roughly, prime prefixes of $\Omega$ must be triply-exponentially sparse, as long as for some $c \gt 1$ there are always $O(\frac{n}{c^k \cdot \log{n}})$ primes less than $n$ with exactly $k$ prime prefixes.

I am trying to figure out if $f(n)$ can have infinitely many prime values.  To show that it cannot, it would suffice to find a way of compressing these prime values to descriptions arbitrarily shorter than $ \log_2{p}$ bits.  This seems to be a tricky task as it runs up against the edge cases of the definitions. Let $L(x) = \lfloor \log_2{x} \rfloor + 1$.  Any number $n$ can be encoded in a prefix-free fashion by first emitting the length of the length of its length in unary, then the length of its length in binary, then its length in binary, then the number itself in binary.  This uses $2 \cdot L(L(L(n))) + L(L(n)) + L(n)$ bits. If we have a prime number $p$, we can improve on this by encoding its index $\pi(p)$, and decoding it with a program that finds the $\pi(p)^{th}$ prime.  By the prime number theorem, we save $L(L(p)) + O(1)$ bits this way.  But the pesky $2 \cdot L(L(L(p)))$ term remains. There is more information we can take advantage of: the $k^{th}$ prime prefix of $\Omega$ is a special type of prime, because it itself has $k-1$ prime prefixes.  So we can count only those primes when decoding it, and heuristically this gives an encoding of size $2 \cdot L(L(L(p))) + L(p) - O(k)$ bits.  Or roughly, prime prefixes of $\Omega$ must be triply-exponentially sparse, as long as for some $c \gt 1$ there are always $O(\frac{n}{c^k \cdot \log{n}})$ primes less than $n$ with exactly $k$ prime prefixes.

13,Asymptotics of the lower approximation of a pair of natural numbers by a coprime pair,Asymptotics of the lower approximation of a pair of natural numbers by a coprime pair,,"When we are working, for instance, in combinatorics or graph theory, sometimes we can have the following situation. For each number $m$ from an infinite set $\mathbb M\subset\mathbb N$ we can construct an example $\mathcal E(m)$ having the required properties. Moreover, for each $n\ge m$ we can use the example $\mathcal E(m)$ for the construction of the example $\mathcal E(n)$ having properties similar to these of $\mathcal E(m)$ . If we wish to obtain the respective asymptotic bound for $E(n)$ for all natural $n$ , we encounter a problem to asymptotically estimate the approximation from below of the natural number $n$ by a number $m$ from the set $\mathbb M$ . For instance, in my old and small work "" On graphs without 4-cycles "" I investigated the problem posed by Erich Friedman here : what is the maximal number $E(n)$ of edges an $n$ -vertex graph without 4-cycles? I found the asymptotics $E(n)=\frac{n^{3/2}}2\left(1+O\left(\frac 1{\ln n}\right)\right)$ as follows. We can easily prove that $E(n)\le\frac{n+n\sqrt{4n-3}}4$ . We can obtain, using projective planes over finite fields, that $E(n)\ge\frac{(n-1)(\sqrt{4n-3}+1)}4-1$ provided $n=q^2+q+1$ where $q$ is a power of a prime. Then, using Rosser's bounds [Ros] $\frac n{\ln n+2}<\pi(n)<\frac n{\ln n-4}$ for $n\ge 55$ , where $\pi(n)$ is the quantity of prime numbers which are not greater than $n$ , I was able to show that for every natural $n\ge 2$ there exists a prime number $p\in\left[n-\frac {6n}{\ln n};n\right]$ . I finally obtained the asymptotics for $E(n)$ from the above results. At the last week I met my old coauthor, Oleg Verbitsky who proposed me the following problem. Let $n$ be a natural number. What is the minimal number $d=d(n)$ such that for each number $n'\ge n$ there exist coprime natural numbers $p,p'$ such that $n-d\le p\le n$ and $n'-d\le p'\le n'$ ? In his research where the question appeared, it is well enough that $d(n)=o(n)$ , hence Oleg do not need any specific bound for $d(n)$ . However,  he thinks that the function $d(n)$ is of independent interest. To obtain the upper bound for $d(n)$ , Oleg simply took a largest prime number not greater than $n$ (my number intuition immediately said that this bound should be too weak), and using the result by Baker, Harman and Pintz [BHP], saying that for sufficiently large $n$ there is a prime belonging to $[n-n^{0.525}, n]$ (by the way, this bound is asymptotically better than my above bound $n-\frac {6n}{\ln n}$ ), he obtained the bound $d(n)=o(n)$ . But both of us are not number theorists,  so my efforts to improve the bound may be an invention of a bicycle. So we decided that it is better to pose the question here. As usually, we are interested mainly in asymptotics of the function $d(n)$ . What have I tried? I expect that $d(n)$ is asymptotically very small (but not an independent on $m$ constant). I have the following evidence for this. Let $k(l)$ be a number of different prime divisors of a number $l$ . Then $k(l)\le \log_2 l$ and this bound can be (essentially) improved using the inequality $l\ge p_1 p_2\dots p_{k(l)}$ instead of $l\ge 2\times 2\times\dots 2$ ( $k(l)$ times), where $p_i$ is the $i$ -th prime number (that is $p_1=2$ , $p_2=3$ and so forth). Moreover, slightly decreasing $n$ to $m$ we should obtain $k(m)$ even essentially smaller than $k(n)$ . For finding such a number $m$ we can use (the above) results on the prime numbers density. So, let $\{q_1,\dots, q_{k(m)}\}$ be the set of all prime divisors of the number $m$ . Then among $d+1$ numbers $n', n'-1,\dots n'-d$ about $(d+1)(1-q_1)\ge (d+1)(1-p_1)$ are not divisible by $q_1$ . Among these numbers about $(d+1)(1-q_1)(1-q_2)\ge (d+1)(1-p_1)(1-p_2)$ are not divisible by $q_2$ and so on. Therefore if $(d(n)+1)(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\dots (1-p_{k(m)})>1$ (which can be assured by a respectively small $d(n)$ ) then there should exist a coprime pair $p,p'$ such that $n-d\le p\le n$ and $n'-d\le p'\le n'$ .

Modular forms are essential to the theory of elliptic curves, but the typical applications rely on very deep theorems (Fermat's last theorem, modularity theorem, Birch-and-Swinnerton Dyer Conjecture, Sato-Tate...). Can we obtain some concrete number theoretic information about elliptic curves without relying on these deep theorems? Here is an example of what I am looking for. The theory of elliptic functions is useful for elliptic curves because, for instance, they describe all isogenies between elliptic curves over subfields of $\mathbb C$, and can also be used to compute the isogenies explicitly, by writing $\wp (\alpha z)$ as a rational function of $\wp (z)$. This gives us very concrete information. Treat the word ""elementary"" relatively--probably nothing here is going to be easy. In particular, we can't say anything about all elliptic curves; we can only say things about particular elliptic curves. One first has to find an elliptic curve associated to a modular form before one can get information, and so probably has to invoke Eichler-Shimura in some form. There are, however, examples where one can compute the elliptic curve associated to a modular form relatively easily. For example, in Knapp's Elliptic Curves he computes that the elliptic curve associated with the eigenform $f\in S_2(\Gamma_0(11))$ is $E: y^2+y=x^3-x^2-10x-20$, and there is a map $X_0(11)\to E(\mathbb C)$.

The way the game works is as follows: take any number of items (like coins or small stones) and partition them into any number of piles with any number of items in each pile. Then take one item from each pile and make a new pile with them. Repeat for as long as necessary. For example: $10$ items, starting with piles of $4, 4, 1, 1$ At first, there are four piles. Taking one item from each leaves us with $3, 3$. Adding back the four we took gives us $4, 3, 3$. Repeating this step results in... $4, 4, 1, 1$ $4, 3, 3$ $3, 3, 2, 2$ $4, 2, 2, 1, 1$ $5, 3, 1, 1$ $4, 4, 2$ $3, 3, 3, 1$ $4, 2, 2, 2$ $4, 3, 1, 1, 1$ $5, 3, 2$ $4, 3, 2, 1$ $\mathbf{4, 3, 2, 1}$ $\dots$ Those with a good eye will quickly see that $4, 3, 2, 1$ is a stable state in that going through a turn of the game doesn't change anything. What is more interesting is that EVERY initial configuration of $10$ items will end up at this stable state. Additionally, $6$ items will always end up in $3, 2, 1$; $15$ items will always end up in $5, 4, 3, 2, 1$; and so on. Triangular numbers of items are the only numbers for which this happens. This is because only a $n, n-1, n-2, \dots, 3, 2, 1 { }$ state is stable; subtracting one from each gets rid of the $1$-pile and adds a pile of $n$. Clearly, a triangular number of items results in a ""root loop"" of size 1. I'm going to go ahead and state an observation and a fact that follows from it. This observation is that all partitions of $n$ items will lead to exactly one other partition of $n$, by definition. This means that while loops can exist, there can never be a partition of $n$ that leads to two partitions of $n$. This has the effect of splitting a directed graph (an edge from $i$ to $j$ has weight 1 iff partition $i$ leads to partition $j$) into a number of subgraphs that exactly corresponds to the number of loops. This is not hard to prove, and I am not Fermat. :P What I found to be even more interesting was what happened when you used a non-triangular number of items. In these cases, you will go into a loop. For example... $7$ $6, 1$ $5, 2$ $4, 2, 1$ $3, 3, 1$ $3, 2, 2$ $3, 2, 1, 1$ $\mathbf{4, 2, 1}$ $\dots$ Thus, starting with $7$ items ends up in a root loop of size $4$. More experimenting reveals that given a non-triangular number $n$ of items, find the triangular number $T_k \geq n$ and $k$ is the size of at least one of the root loops in the directed graph of all partitions of $n$. Why is this so?","I first learned of Bulgarian solitaire from one of Martin Gardner's books a while ago and have since investigated it somewhat. Google-searching has revealed that surprisingly little work has been done (publicly anyway) in this area. The way the game works is as follows: take any number of items (like coins or small stones) and partition them into any number of piles with any number of items in each pile. Then take one item from each pile and make a new pile with them. Repeat for as long as necessary. For example: $10$ items, starting with piles of $4, 4, 1, 1$ At first, there are four piles. Taking one item from each leaves us with $3, 3$. Adding back the four we took gives us $4, 3, 3$.
