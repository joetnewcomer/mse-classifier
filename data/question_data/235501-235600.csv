7,Definitions of the usual order in $\mathbb{N}$,Definitions of the usual order in,\mathbb{N},"I know of basically two ways of defining the usual order in $\mathbb{N}$: By using the relation ""$\in$"" on $\mathbb{N}$ so that $\forall m,n\in N(m<n\longleftrightarrow m\in n)$. By saying that $\forall m, n \in \mathbb{N}(m<n\longleftrightarrow \exists p\in \mathbb{N}(n=p+m))$. The first one seems to be more ""artificial"" and ""elemental"" in the sense that is more difficult to prove that it is indeed a linear order on $\mathbb{N}$. But such a definition is the one prefered by set theory books.  So my question is why? since the second one is equivalent except that is much simpler and intuitive, at least I see it that way. Also what are the main advantages of using one over the other?, unless it's just a matter of taste. Edit: To make precise my question I'll add some extra context. First of all I'm starting the definition of $\mathbb{N}$ just as is made in set theory. It might be by taking the intersection of all inductive sets or else it might be by saying that a natural number is a transitive set with the relation $\in$ on it being a strict linear order...,etc.  The thing is essentially that I don't understand the fact of doing the defintion $(1)$ which is by far more elementary than just starting by proving the theorem of recursion and then making the definition of $+$ to get $(2)$, which, as I said, is simpler and more natural and intuitive. So I can't see the advantages of $(1)$ over $(2)$ and why set theory books prefer one over the other (This makes me think that I'm missing something). Also my observation is that having $(1)$ it's very easy to deduce $(2)$ by just defining $+$ by using the recursion theorem and then applying the principle of induction. At this point I don't know if its possible to deduce $(1)$ by having $(2)$. So I'm in doubt here because I'm assuming that both definition are equivalent, thought I don't now and if they aren't then there should be a reason why $(1)$ is the appropriate definition.

19,Infinity in ZFC vs infinity in the metatheory,Infinity in ZFC vs infinity in the metatheory,,"I was reading about different ways to formalize the notion of infinity in ZFC. The classic axiom is of course to have the existence of an inductive set, but you can also assert the existence of a Dedekind infinite set, and it turns out it is equivalent. (This question shows this: How can I define $\mathbb{N}$ if I postulate existence of a Dedekind-infinite set rather than existence of an inductive set? ) They both give a notion of infinity internal to the theory. However, I am not quite sure how much this coincides with a ""metatheoretic"" understanding of infinity.

40,Does iterating the Union operator yield the empty set?,Does iterating the Union operator yield the empty set?,,"Background In elementary set theory the union is taught as a binary operator on two sets, which contains all the elements of both those sets. $$ A = \{1,2,3\}\\ B = \{2,3,4\}\\ A\cup B = \{1,2,3,4\} $$ In formal set theory this is generalized to a unary operator on one collection of sets, acting on each of the sets in that collection. $$ \bigcup \{A,B\} = \{1,2,3,4\} $$ And now we can apply the union operator to a collection of not only two, but an arbitrary number of sets … $$ C = \{1,4,5\}\\ \bigcup \{A,B,C\} = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$ … even infinitely many. $$ N_1 = \{1\} \land N_2 = \{2\} \land N_3 = \{3\} \land \cdots\\ \bigcup \{N_1,N_2,N_3,\dots\} = \{1,2,3,\dots\} $$ We can even take the union of a union of sets. $$ D = \{A,B\}\\ E = \{B,C\}\\ \bigcup \bigcup \{D,E\} = \bigcup \{A,B,C\} = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$ Intermission Advanced axiomatic set theory teaches the idea that everything is a set, and that the first set guaranteed to exist is the empty set. Other sets must be built from that starting point. For example the natural number $0$ is the empty set $\emptyset$, the natural number $1$ is constructed as the singleton $\{0\}$, the natural number $2$ can be constructed as the pair $\{0,1\}$ (depending on the author), and so on. The Axiom of Existence is the only axiom that guarantees that a set—the empty set—exists without the input of other sets. Other sets like ordered pairs and unions can only exist given an input. The Axiom of Union states, “ given a collection of sets, there exists a set who owns any element of any set in that collection ” (as opposed to “all elements of all sets in the collection,” which would yield the intersection). The point is, a union set can exist, but the only way to create it is by giving, as an input, an existing set. That existing set could be a pair or a subset or even another union, which also require inputs; or it could be the empty set, which requires no previous set to exist. The bottom line is that the empty set is the foundation upon which all other sets are built. Question So finally here’s my question. If you take the union of any set $S$, and then take the union of that set, and keep going, will this process eventually yield the empty set? $$ \text{hypothesis: } \left(\forall S\right)\left(\bigcup\bigcup\cdots\bigcup S = \emptyset\right) $$","Background In elementary set theory the union is taught as a binary operator on two sets, which contains all the elements of both those sets. $$ A = \{1,2,3\}\\ B = \{2,3,4\}\\ A\cup B = \{1,2,3,4\} $$ In formal set theory this is generalized to a unary operator on one collection of sets, acting on each of the sets in that collection. $$ \bigcup \{A,B\} = \{1,2,3,4\} $$ And now we can apply the union operator to a collection of not only two, but an arbitrary number of sets … $$ C = \{1,4,5\}\\ \bigcup \{A,B,C\} = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$ … even infinitely many. $$ N_1 = \{1\} \land N_2 = \{2\} \land N_3 = \{3\} \land \cdots\\ \bigcup \{N_1,N_2,N_3,\dots\} = \{1,2,3,\dots\} $$ We can even take the union of a union of sets. $$ D = \{A,B\}\\ E = \{B,C\}\\ \bigcup \bigcup \{D,E\} = \bigcup \{A,B,C\} = \{1,2,3,4,5\} $$ Intermission Advanced axiomatic set theory teaches the idea that everything is a set, and that the first set guaranteed to exist is the empty set. Other sets must be built from that starting point. For example the natural number $0$ is the empty set $\emptyset$, the natural number $1$ is constructed as the singleton $\{0\}$, the natural number $2$ can be constructed as the pair $\{0,1\}$ (depending on the author), and so on. The Axiom of Existence is the only axiom that guarantees that a set—the empty set—exists without the input of other sets. Other sets like ordered pairs and unions can only exist given an input. The Axiom of Union states, “ given a collection of sets, there exists a set who owns any element of any set in that collection ” (as opposed to “all elements of all sets in the collection,” which would yield the intersection). The point is, a union set can exist, but the only way to create it is by giving, as an input, an existing set. That existing set could be a pair or a subset or even another union, which also require inputs; or it could be the empty set, which requires no previous set to exist. The bottom line is that the empty set is the foundation upon which all other sets are built. Question So finally here’s my question. If you take the union of any set $S$, and then take the union of that set, and keep going, will this process eventually yield the empty set? $$ \text{hypothesis: } \left(\forall S\right)\left(\bigcup\bigcup\cdots\bigcup S = \emptyset\right) $$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'axioms']"

Let $X$ be a set, and suppose $C$ is a collection of subsets of $X$. Then if $C$ = Empty Set, Union of $C$ is an Empty Set too and Intersection of $C$ is the set $X$. Now my questions are: If $C$ is an Empty Set and also the collection of subsets of $X$ then isn't it true that $X$ is also essentially an empty set. For example, let $X = \{1,2\}$ then according to the definition $C = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}$. So, in the same manner $C$ can be an Empty Set only when the collection of subsets of $X$ is an Empty Set or $X = \emptyset$. Union of $C$ is the union of all the elements present in $C$. So if $C$ is an Empty Set, then the only set present in the collection of sets $C$ is the value of an Empty Set.

The first step of the proof relies using contradiction and thus starts by saying that the intersection of all the sets is empty: $$ \cap_{\alpha } K_{\alpha} = \emptyset $$ Then the professor says the following (perhaps paraphrased a little bit): If a point is in the intersection then it means that point is not in any of the complements. So if there is no point in any intersection then some point must be in some complement. The first part of the statement seems obvious to me, if one is in all the sets then thats the same as saying that point must be in every set simultaneously. If one is in all the sets simultaneously then you can't be in any one of the complements (since otherwise you'd not be in that set and thus can't be in all of them simultaneously). Basically this relies that being in a set means you can't be in the complement of that set and being in all the sets means you can't be in any one of the complements. Basically: $$ x \in \cap_{\alpha} K_{\alpha} \implies  x \not \in\cup_{\alpha} K^c_{\alpha} $$ or $$ \cap_{\alpha} K_{\alpha} = ( \cup_{\alpha} K^c_{\alpha} )^c $$ However, the argument proceeds to then say: So if there is no point in any intersection then some point must be in some complement. which is the part I am struggling to understand.

The reason I don't like this reasoning is because it just feels like symbol crunching rather the way professor Su explained it seems there is a naturally flowing way to reach that conclusion from logic or just reasoning without requiring long winding manipulation of rules and symbols. So what is the simple logical way to understand that part of the reasoning? I think I've identified what confuses me the most. It seems that DeMorgan's law's talks about the equality of two sets in terms of what they have, but the fact that in the question premise we are dealing with the empty set itself (i.e. a set that has nothing) is what is confusing me and then making a jump to a set that has everything coupled with DeMorgan's, complements seems to confusing to deal with all at once.

(2) If there is no special terminology, how would one best convey this concept notationally? e.g. $A \subseteq S$ and $B \subseteq S$ s.t. $A \cap B =  \varnothing$ maybe be one possibility, but it doesn't show that the union of A and B are the set S...",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'terminology']"
