46,Why do we use this complicated algorithm for finding values of trigonometric functions?,Why do we use this complicated algorithm for finding values of trigonometric functions?,,"My Mathematics Textbook covers the topic of Values of Trigonometric Functions at Allied Angles using some general formulae first and then goes on to the topic of finding the values of trigonometric functions at allied angles using an algorithm . The cases discussed in finding the values using some general formulae are : At $(-x)$ At $\Big (\dfrac{\pi}{2} \pm x \Big )$ At $(\pi \pm x)$ At $\Big ( \dfrac {3\pi}{2} \pm x \Big )$ At $(2\pi \pm x)$ which can also be written as $(\pm $ $x)$ The algorithm is as follows : Let the angle be $x$ If $x<0$ and $x = (-a)$ , continue with the further steps as $a$ in place of $x$ and when the final result arrives : if $f$ is an even function, then $f(x) = f(-x)$ , so $f(x) = f(a)$ and if $f$ is an odd function, $f(-x) = -f(x)$ , so $f(x) = -f(-x) = -f(a)$ Express $x$ (or $a$ ) in the form of $\dfrac {n\pi}{2} \pm \alpha$ , where $0<\alpha<\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ or $\alpha \in \Big (0, \dfrac {\pi}{2} \Big )$ If $n$ is odd, then $\sin x = \pm \cos \alpha$ , $\cos x = \pm \sin \alpha$ , $\tan x = \pm \cot \alpha$ , $\cot x = \pm \tan \alpha$ , $\sec x = \pm \csc \alpha$ and $\csc x = \pm \sec \alpha$ If $n$ is even, then $\sin x = \pm \sin \alpha$ , $\cos x = \pm \cos \alpha$ , $\tan x = \pm \tan \alpha$ , $\cot x = \pm \cot \alpha$ , $\sec x = \pm \sec \alpha$ and $\csc x = \pm \csc \alpha$ Determine the quadrant that $x$ lies in and then decide the sign of the value Let's take an example : Find the value of $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4}$ . One method to do this will be using the first method. $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} = \sin \Big (2\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{4} \Big )$ We know that $\sin (2\pi-x)=(-\sin x)$ . So, $\sin \Big (2\pi - \dfrac{\pi}{4} \Big ) = \Big ( -\sin \dfrac {\pi}{4} \Big ) = -\dfrac {1}{\sqrt{2}}$ Another method would be to use the algorithm $\dfrac{7\pi}{4}=\dfrac{3\pi}{2}+\dfrac{\pi}{4}$ , so $\dfrac {3\pi}{2} < \dfrac{7\pi}{4} < 2\pi$ and $\dfrac{7\pi}{4}$ lies in the $IV$ quadrant, which means that $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} < 0$ Now, $\dfrac{7\pi}{4} = \dfrac {3.\pi}{2} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}$ . $3$ is odd, so $\sin \dfrac{7\pi}{4} = -\sin \dfrac {\pi}{4} = -\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ Now, this algorithm seems like something extremely complex for solving simple questions like these.

I'm trying to calculate the largest semi-circle I can fit on line $B$ (i.e., calculate r), that will (always?) be tangent to line $A$ and $C$ when the angles are acute. So I think: $$ r = \frac{B.sin\Theta_{1}  .sin\Theta_{2} } { sin\Theta_{1} + sin\Theta_{2} } $$ For the cases where $A > a_{1}$ and $C > c_{1}$ (meaning A is longer than the theoretical tangent point at the angle $\Theta_{1}$ etc.). But what if $A$ was very short? Does $r$ simply become the distance to the end point of $A$ ? And how do I 'know' when this is the case mathematically? EDIT: To add some clarification... This is part of a larger effort to find the largest semi-circle that will fit inside an arbitrary closed polygon. The lines illustrated are thus three consecutive segments of that polygon They may be any angle and length, and don't form a triangle unless my polygon is a triangle. Clearly, if the angle at either or both ends is larger than $\pi$ , the semi-circle can go right to that vertex and isn't impinged upon by the next or previous segment. The part I'm mostly struggling with is incorporating the line length in determining $r$ and the centre point. Obviously, it has an effect at any given angle: My ultimate idea is to draw lines between every polygon vertex and calculate the largest semi-circle that will fit inside the polygon along that line. I hope that will give me a good guess at the largest generally that will fit. EDIT 2: Specifics... I know the blue values, how do I calculate $r$ (and thus $b_{2}$ and $b_{3}$ )?

So I think: For the cases where and (meaning A is longer than the theoretical tangent point at the angle etc.). But what if was very short? Does simply become the distance to the end point of ? And how do I 'know' when this is the case mathematically? EDIT: To add some clarification... This is part of a larger effort to find the largest semi-circle that will fit inside an arbitrary closed polygon. The lines illustrated are thus three consecutive segments of that polygon They may be any angle and length, and don't form a triangle unless my polygon is a triangle. Clearly, if the angle at either or both ends is larger than , the semi-circle can go right to that vertex and isn't impinged upon by the next or previous segment. The part I'm mostly struggling with is incorporating the line length in determining and the centre point. Obviously, it has an effect at any given angle: My ultimate idea is to draw lines between every polygon vertex and calculate the largest semi-circle that will fit inside the polygon along that line. I hope that will give me a good guess at the largest generally that will fit. EDIT 2: Specifics... I know the blue values, how do I calculate (and thus and )? ( and being trivial). It seems like it should be easy...but I just can't seem to get my head around it.","\Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2} A B C A = a_{1} + a_{2} B A C

In my specific case, I am considering a unit sphere ( $r=1$ ). The first great circle arc goes from $A(\lambda_A, \phi_A)$ to $B(\lambda_B, \phi_B)$ , while the second great circle arc goes from $B$ (the intersection point) to $C(\lambda_C, \phi_C)$ . Here, $\lambda$ is longitude, or the angle with the reference meridian, while $\phi$ is latitude, or the angle with respect to the equatorial plane, like is the case in the geographic coordinate system. My spherical coordinates are related to cartesian coordinates as follows: $$ x = \cos(\lambda) \cos(\phi) $$ $$ y = \sin(\lambda) \cos(\phi) $$ $$ z = \sin(\phi) $$ The reference meridian is thus described by $y=0, x>0$ and the equatorial plane is defined as $z=0$ . I can calculate the angle between $AB$ and $BC$ . First, I describe $A$ , $B$ , $C$ as cartesian vectors, e.g. $$\vec{A}= \big(\cos(\lambda_A) \cos(\phi_A),\ \sin(\lambda_A) \cos(\phi_A),\ \sin(\phi_A) \big).$$ Then I take the cross products $\vec{V_{ab}} = \vec{A}\times\vec{B}$ and $\vec{V_{bc}} = \vec{B}\times\vec{C}$ . Then I take the angle between these two vectors (which describe the planes that the great circle arcs $AB$ and $BC$ respectively lie on): $$\text{spherical angle}(AB, BC) = \frac{\vec{V_{ab}}\cdot \vec{V_{bc}}}{ ||\vec{V_{ab}}||\cdot ||\vec{V_{bc}}||}. $$ However, I want the signed spherical angle, so that the angle that $AB$ forms with $BC$ is defined clockwise between $[0, 2\pi]$ .
