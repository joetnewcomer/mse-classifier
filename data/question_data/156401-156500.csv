1,Finding the minimum value of $X+Y$ given inputs $A$ and $B$ and some constraints,Finding the minimum value of  given inputs  and  and some constraints,X+Y A B,"The problem is to find the minimum value of $X+Y$ given some value of $A$ and $B$ and the constraint that $$(A+X)\ \big|\ (B+Y)$$ and $X,Y \ge 0$ . This was given as a coding problem, but I want to see if this has a solution without using code. First we know that $(B+Y) = k(A+X)$ for some integer $k \ge 1$ . If $A\ | \ B$ then trivially $X=0=Y$ works. Otherwise, taking into consideration that $Y\ge 0$ , we get the bound $$k(A+X) \ge B$$ Also from the fact that minimizing $X+Y$ is the same as minimizing $X+Y+A+B = (k+1)(A+X)$ . Since $X,Y\ge 0$ this gives us $$(k+1)(A+X) \ge A+B$$ From this we tried the ""trivial"" thing $$ k = \max\left\{\lceil \sqrt{A+B}-1\rceil,\lceil\sqrt B\rceil\right\}$$ $$ X = \max\left\{\lceil \sqrt{A+B}-A\rceil,\lceil\sqrt B-A\rceil\right\}$$ But this does not work, as it gives a large value for $X+Y$ or $X$ becomes negative.

2,On Sixth Powers $x_1^6+x_2^6+x_3^6+\dots+x_7^6 = z^6$ revisited,On Sixth Powers  revisited,x_1^6+x_2^6+x_3^6+\dots+x_7^6 = z^6,"While answering this question , I decided to revisit the equation, $$x_1^6+x_2^6+x_3^6+\dots+x_7^6 = z^6$$ which I asked about in an old post and, with today's faster computers, might yield some new insights. Primitive solutions to the equation, $$x_1^k+x_2^k+x_3^k+\dots+x_{k+1}^k = z^k$$ where k+1 is a prime p come in two kinds: 1st, $z$ is integrally divisible by $p$ , or 2nd, it is not. The 1st kind has smaller solutions than the 2nd kind, but it is the latter we are interested in since there is a possibility one of its terms is $x_i=0$ . I. 4th powers: $(k+1 = 5)$ $$2^4 + 2^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 + 4^4 = 5^4$$ $$10^4 + 10^4 + 10^4 + 17^4 + 30^4 = 31^4 = z_1^4$$ $$\;\color{red}{0^4} + 30^4 + 120^4 + 272^4 + 315^4 = 353^4 = z_2^4$$ Note that for the 2nd kind, then $z_2=353$ is more than 10x the smaller solution $z_1=31$ (which is prime). This may give us a rough idea of what to expect for 6th powers. II. 6th powers: $(k+1 = 7)$ $$74^6 + 234^6 + 402^6 + 474^6 + 702^6 + 894^6 + 1077^6 = 1141^6 =(7\times163)^6$$ $$42^6(195^6 + 260^6 + 440^6 + 506^6 + 580^6) + 19229^6 + 33354^6 = 34781^6$$ $$\color{red}{0^6}+x_1^6+x_2^6+x_3^6+x_4^6+x_5^6+x_6^6 = z_2^6$$ Based on 4th powers, we could assume that $z_2$ is more than 14x the smaller solution $z_1=34781$ (which is also prime), or roughly $z_2 > 480000$ . In fact, according to a 2002 paper, Meyrignac claims no solutions with $z_2 < 730000$ . Edit : I just noticed that $730000/34781 \approx 20.99$ , so it seems $z_2$ is more than 21x the smaller solution $z_1$ . If the trend continues, it does not bode well for $10$ th powers. III. Tables for 6th powers In Meyrignac's site http://euler.free.fr/database.txt , there are exactly $100+78=178$ known solutions to the equation (6,1,7) with $z<412000$ .

12,Why is the Galois conjugate of a modular eigenform another eigenform?,Why is the Galois conjugate of a modular eigenform another eigenform?,,"In this question, $k \geq 2$ and $N \geq 1$ are integers. We consider the space $S = \mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_1(N))^{new}$ of modular forms of weight $k$ for $\Gamma_1(N)$ (the same question can certainly be asked for $k = 1$ but I think that this MO answer should help). It has an action of Hecke operators $T_p$ (for all primes $p$ ) and diamonds $\langle d\rangle$ (for all integers $d$ coprime to $N$ ). Let $T_{\mathbb{Q}}$ be the (commutative) $\mathbb{Q}$ -algebra generated by these operators (seen as a subalgebra of the ring of endomorphisms of $S$ ), and $T_{\mathbb{C}}$ be the sub- $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra of the ring of endomorphisms of $S$ generated by these operators. My question is the following: let $f \in S$ be a Hecke normalized newform. Let $\sigma$ be an automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$ (or of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ if we accept that the eigenvalues of Hecke operators are algebraic). It is well-known (it appears in, say, Shimura's 1976 paper The special values of zeta functions associated with cusp forms ) that $f^{\sigma}$ (defined as a formal power series by letting $\sigma$ act on all the coefficients of $f$ ) is another Hecke eigenform. But why is that? A possible reformulation involves using the well-known fact that such eigenforms are exactly the $\mathbb{C}$ -morphisms $T_{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ . Now, if $f$ corresponds to the morphism $\mu$ , $f^{\sigma}$ corresponds to a $\mathbb{C}$ -morphism mapping $T_n$ to $\sigma \circ \mu(T_n)$ . But this cannot define a $\mathbb{C}$ -morphism $T_{\mathbb{C}}$ unless every $\mathbb{C}$ -linear relation between the $T_n$ (and the diamonds) is in fact rational. In other words, we need that $T_{\mathbb{Q}} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{C} \rightarrow T_{\mathbb{C}}$ be injective. But I'm not sure if this is easier to prove than the original statement. In weight $2$ , Hecke operators can be interpreted as endomorphisms of the Jacobian of $X_1(N)$ and cusp forms can be interpreted as global differentials on said Jacobian. So we could be done if, for a complex abelian variety $J$ , $\mathrm{End}(J) \otimes \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(H^0(J,\Omega^1))$ is injective. This is, however, false, because of $J=\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (and other instances of complex multiplication). If, however, we have a full basis of $\mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_1(N))$ by cusp forms with rational Fourier coefficients, this means that the image of the Fourier expansion map $\mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_1(N)) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}[[q]]$ is of the form $V \otimes \mathbb{C}$ , where $V$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{Q}[[q]]$ and thus that the Galois conjugate of a modular form for $\mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_1(N))$ is in $\mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_1(N))$ , and then the result follows easily. But this doesn't look easier than the bolded question. So where does that assertion come from? Why is the Galois conjugate of a newform a newform of same level?

Using the fact that every prime has a primitive root, it is true whenever $m$ is a prime of the form $p = 6n-1$ because $b^3$ takes all values modulo $p$ . For other $p$ , $a^2$ has $(p-1)/2 + 1$ different values modulo $p$ , $b^3$ has $(p-1)/3 + 1$ different values, and $c^4$ has $\frac{p-1}4 + 1$ different values modulo $p$ if $p-1$ is divisible by $4$ , and $\frac{p-1}2 +1$ otherwise.

While I don't know in advance how many people will arrive, I'll simply stop accepting people beyond $n$ , so its going to be $n$ in the worst case. I want to assign these in a random order (so as to minimize the information that the person can get on the ID he's going to be assigned by looking at the IDs that came before him; no more than the $O(n \log n)$ algorithm leveraging the Fisher Yates shuffle described in my first attempt below). I want to do this on the fly and without having to save the ID's I've already assigned in memory (the memory footprint should be no more than $O(\log n)$ due to the bits required to store a single ID). Is there an algorithm for this? If not, what are some good algorithms that work with $O(\log n)$ memory and do well on the objective function defined in the first edit below? EDIT-1: To make the objective function concrete, let's say every person is given a chance to guess their ID in advance when they arrive. If they get it right, they get a 1\$ discount on any purchase. We can assume these people are all very intelligent and will maximize their odds of getting the discount. My algorithm should be such that it minimizes the average discount I end up giving them. My attempts: If we can work with $O(n \log n)$ memory, we would simply store the numbers $1$ to $n$ in an array and permute it randomly with the Fisher-Yates shuffle. This makes all $n!$ permutations equally likely. Then, we loop through the permuted array as customers arrive and give them their IDs. Note that unless a given customer knows my permuted array and he comes in very late, he can't get much information about the ID that's going to be assigned to him by looking at the IDs that came before him. To do this with $O(\log n)$ memory (only the bits required for storing the IDs), one could express the numbers $1$ to $n$ in binary and permute the digits of the chronological order of any customer in some pre-specified way to get a new number. However, this doesn't make the order of the ID's a completely random permutation, since the number of 1's in binary representations of the chronological position and the assigned ID are the same. So, you could rule out certain ID's based on the chronological position. Looking at ID's assigned in the past, a customer could figure this out. EDIT-2: With the $O(n)$ memory algorithm involving the Fisher Yates shuffle, it's hard to say what the expected discount I end up giving will be if the people don't know $n$ (see here: Expected discount shop owner will have to shell out in a guessing game with customers ). But if they do know $n$ , I think it'll become: $$d = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{i}$$ EDIT-3: @MishaLavrov pointed out that even if we assign id's per the chronological order, we need $O(\log(n))$ bits to store the ids. So, an $O(1)$ algorithm isn't possible.","I have a large number of people coming to my shop and want to assign ids from to at-most to all of them. While I don't know in advance how many people will arrive, I'll simply stop accepting people beyond , so its going to be in the worst case. I want to assign these in a random order (so as to minimize the information that the person can get on the ID he's going to be assigned by looking at the IDs that came before him; no more than the algorithm leveraging the Fisher Yates shuffle described in my first attempt below). I want to do this on the fly and without having to save the ID's I've already assigned in memory (the memory footprint should be no more than due to the bits required to store a single ID). Is there an algorithm for this? If not, what are some good algorithms that work with memory and do well on the objective function defined in the first edit below? EDIT-1: To make the objective function concrete, let's say every person is given a chance to guess their ID in advance when they arrive. If they get it right, they get a 1\$ discount on any purchase. We can assume these people are all very intelligent and will maximize their odds of getting the discount. My algorithm should be such that it minimizes the average discount I end up giving them.

18,Repeated application of narcissistic function,Repeated application of narcissistic function,,"Over on Code Golf.SE , I've asked this challenge about the looping behaviour of a function related to narcissistic numbers . In the question, I define the function as, for a natural number $x = d_1d_2...d_n$ where $d_i$ is a single digit between $0$ and $9$ and $x$ has $n$ digits: $$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n d_i^n$$ In this case, a number is narcissistic if it is a fixed point of $f(x)$ i.e. $f(x) = x$ . However, the question is about repeated application of this function. For example, repeatedly applying $f$ to $x = 127$ leads to the following chain of numbers: $$127,352,160,217,352,160,217,...$$ and the triplet $352, 160, 217$ repeats ad infinitum from here. I have two hypotheses which I believe to be correct but have no idea how to prove: For all natural numbers $x > 0$ , repeated application of $f$ eventually leads to a repeating loop (counting a fixed point as a ""loop"" of 1 element). The length of this loop is always less than or equal to $14$ . For example, $x = 147$ is the lowest number that yields $14$ , with a loop of $$537059, 681069, 886898, 1626673, 1665667, 2021413, 18829, 124618, 312962, 578955, 958109, 1340652, 376761, 329340$$ My brute forcing attempts have shown that this is true for all $x < 10^5$ , and is currently (at time or writing) at around $x = 64000$ without having found a counter example to either hypothesis.

30,What is the flaw in this proof of the Collatz Conjecture?,What is the flaw in this proof of the Collatz Conjecture?,,"Would love any feedback for this proposed proof of the Collatz Conjecture. (For more details explaining each step, I made a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0F4zbNdbTU ) Ignoring all even number (which trivially lead to an odd number), we create a ""Collatz Odd-Only Variant"" as such, where $n$ is a positive odd integer: $f(n) = \left\{\begin{matrix} \frac{n-1}{4} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 5 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }8)\\ \frac{3n+1}{4} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 1 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }8)\\  \frac{3n+1}{2} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 3 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }4)\\ \end{matrix}\right.$ This creates a tree that looks like this: Collatz Odd Only Variant Tree We then must show that all odd numbers in this variant are connected to 1. (That is, they do not create loops or diverge elsewhere.) To do this, we create a new simpler function, again where $n$ is a positive odd integer: $f(n) = \left\{\begin{matrix}\ \frac{n-1}{4} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 5 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }8)\\ \frac{n+3}{4} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 1 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }8)\\  \frac{n-1}{2} & \mbox{if }n\equiv 3 \mbox{ }(\mbox{mod }4)\\ \end{matrix}\right.$ In this function, we know that all $n$ 's will lead to 1, because $n$ must shrink with every iteration, and it cannot shrink below 1. This creates a tree like this: Simpler Odd-Only Tree Since we know this tree must contain all positive odd integers, all we have to do is disconnect and reattach some nodes so that this tree matches the ""Collatz Odd-Only Variant"" tree. As long as we do not reconnect a node to one of its own children (a node somewhere above it, representing the iteration of the function that preceded it), we are sure that we will never get loops and that the odd numbers will remain connected to 1. When we disconnected the $\frac{n+3}{4}$ nodes and reattach them to $\frac{3n+1}{4}$ nodes, we know we will never connect it to a child, because we must connect it to a node that is less than $n$ (and all of $n$ 's children will, by definition, be greater than $n$ ). Disconnecting $\frac{n-1}{2}$ nodes to $\frac{3n+1}{2}$ is also certain to never connect to one of its own children, because iterating backwards through our function can never give us $\frac{3n+1}{2}$ . (We can see this by checking the inverses of the equations in our function, even when we combine them to create composite functions.) Since we know all nodes can be disconnected and reconnected while remaining attached to the tree connecting them all to 1, doesn't this prove the conjecture? Or what am I missing?

I have later, discovered seven more solution families, now for $d=7$ , but I can't find a single solution example for $d\ge9$ (details below), still (For $d=9$ , smallest example is $\gt10^{17}$ , if it exists). If all $3$ -palindromes are found/characterized, then it would be easy to see whether any of them can exist as a part of a $4$ -palindrome , whose existence is a open problem. $3$ -palindromic A number $n$ is palindromic (a palindrome) in number base $b\gt1$ if it is the same when its digits are reversed in that number base. For example: $121$ is a a palindrome in number base $10$ since $121=\color{}1\cdot10^2+2\cdot10^1+1\cdot10^0=121_{10}$ $5$ is a palindrome in number base $2$ (binary) since $5=\color{}1\cdot2^2+0\cdot2^1+1\cdot2^0=101_2$ I say that a number $n$ is $3$ -palindromic if it is simultaneously palindromic in three consecutive number bases $b,b+1,b+2$ , and has at least two digits in all of those number bases (Since one digit numbers are trivially palindromic). For example: $178$ is $3$ -palindromic since $178=454_6 = 343_7 = 262_8$ is palindromic in bases $6,7,8$ . $3360633$ is $3$ -palindromic since $6281826_9=3360633_{10}=1995991_{11}$ . There are infinitely many ""short enough"" $3$ -palindromes Let $d$ be the number of digits a number $n$ has when written in base $b$ . If $d$ is small enough (numbers are ""short enough""), and odd, we can find many examples: There are no $3$ -palindromes among $d$ digit numbers when $d$ is even. This is because when a number is a palindrome in base $b$ , and also has an even number of digits in that base, then it is divisible by $b+1$ and thus ends with $0$ in base $b+1$ . Thus, lets assume $d$ is odd, and also $d\gt1$ since one digit numbers are trivially palindromic. There are infinitely many numbers that are $3$ -palindromic and have $d=3,5,7$ digits: $178, 300, 373, 676, 1111, 1702, \dots$ are $d=3$ digit $3$ -palindromes. $154593982, 234531337, 344570692,\dots$ are $d=5$ digit $3$ -palindromes. $3360633, 19987816, 43443858,\dots$ are $d=7$ digit $3$ -palindromes. Characterization of all ""short enough"" $3$ -palindromes $(d\lt 9)$ Formulas for above sequences are shown in comments of A279093 , and here in more detail: All numbers $n$ palindromic in number bases $b,b+1,b+2$ with $d=3$ digits are given by: $F_3=\{n\in\mathbb N : n=\frac12(b^3 + 3b^2+5b+2),b=6+2k,k\in\mathbb N_0\}\cup\{300\}$ It can be proven $^{[1]}$ that $n$ is a $d=3$ digit $3$ -palindrome if and only if $n\in F_3$ . All numbers $n$ palindromic in number bases $b,b+1,b+2$ with $d=5$ digits are in: $F_5=\{n\in\mathbb N : n=\frac14(3 b^5 + 15 b^4 + 35 b^3 + 45 b^2 + 37 b + 13),b=45+4k,k\in\mathbb N_0\}$ I strongly conjecture that $n$ is a $d=5$ digit $3$ -palindrome if and only if $n\in F_5$ . I conjecture that all $3$ -palindormes with $d=7$ digits are given by: $F_7=F^{(0)}_7\bigcup F^{(1)}_7\bigcup F^{(2)}_7\bigcup \dots \bigcup F^{(m)}_7\bigcup \dots$ Where sets $F^{(m)}_7,m\in\mathbb N$ are mutually disjoint and given by: $\{n\in\mathbb N : n=n_{m}(b)\}$ , where $n_m(b)$ is a polynomial of degree $7$ , that goes over $b=c+tk,c,t\in\mathbb N$ , and where set $F^{(0)}_7$ is finite and already fully found (exact elements for $m=0$ can be found at the linked question or at the linked OEIS sequence, among ""known terms that do not belong to any families""). I have found $F^{(m)}_7$ for $m=1,2,3,4,5,6,7$ , and I think there could be more of these. The latest one has the smallest element of size $\approx 10^{17}$ , and I haven't searched beyond $10^{18}$ . $F^{(m)}_7=\{n\in\mathbb N : n=n_{m}(b), b=c+tk, k\in\mathbb N_0\}$ then $[m, n_m(b), (c,t)]$ are given by: (Where + sign should stand between the coefficients - but table is too wide then.) $$ \begin{matrix} 1, & \frac12 ( 6 & 25 b & 55 b^2 & 73 b^3 & 55 b^4 & 25 b^5 & 7 b^6 & b^7 ), & (74,2)\\ 2, & \frac{1}{6} (4 & 25 b & 55 b^2 & 73 b^3 & 55 b^4 & 25 b^5 & 7 b^6 & b^7), & (56, 6) \\ 3, & \frac16(28 & 94 b & 175 b^2 & 217 b^3 & 175 b^4 & 91 b^5 & 28 b^6 & 4 b^7), & (173,6) \\ 4, & \frac{1}{6} (32 & 125 b & 275 b^2 & 365 b^3 & 275 b^4 & 125 b^5 & 35 b^6 & 5 b^7), & (278, 6) \\ 5, & \frac{1}{12} (10 & 68 b & 193 b^2 & 269 b^3 & 187 b^4 & 71 b^5 & 16 b^6 & 2 b^7), &(37,12) \\ 6, & \frac{1}{12} (66 & 256 b & 543 b^2 & 703 b^3 & 537 b^4 & 253 b^5 & 72 b^6 & 10 b^7), &(117,12) \\ 7, & \frac{1}{12} (10 & 80 b & 283 b^2 & 419 b^3 & 277 b^4 & 89 b^5 & 16 b^6 & 2 b^7), &(289,12) \end{matrix} $$ Notice that $c\equiv 2,5,2\pmod 6$ for $t=6$ and that $c\equiv 1,9,1\pmod {12}$ for $t=12$ . Also notice the unexpected coincidental similarity between $m=1,2$ . If you want to sort them by smallest element $\min\{F^{(m)}_7\}$ , ascending, they would be in order: $m=5,2,1,6,3,7,4$ , with those minimal elements being: $$\begin{matrix} m & \min\{F^{(m)}_7\} & (b,b+1,b+2) \\ 5 & 19683596522 & (37,38,39) \\ 2 & 326217315210 & (56,57,58) \\ 1 & 6678940007962 & (74,75,76) \\  6 & 265965216105640 & (117,118,119) \\ 3 & 3219426999580862 & (173,174,185) \\ 7 & 28854914566144178 & (289,290,291) \\  4 & 109665618707825827 & (278,279,280) \end{matrix}$$ The next set, $F^{(8)}_7$ has smallest element $\gt 10^{18}$ . I'm not sure how to find the next set, without the brute force search. There are probably more sets with both $t=6$ and $t=12$ , and I'm not sure about $t=2$ . Q: Can we find a general characterization for sets $F^{(m)}_7$ (how many more are there)? Update: Number bases $\le412$ and from $600$ to $612$ do not have a new solution (family). This indicates a new family of solutions, if it exists, would appear in bases $\gt 612$ . Given first $7$ families appear in first $300$ bases, and in next $300$ bases no new families appear, it could be that the $8$ th family does not exits. Here you can see the seven known familis in more detail. (Exact digits in each base). ""Long numbers"" as $3$ -palindromes Let $d\ge9$ be the number of digits of number $n$ when written in number base $b$ , and let $n$ satisfy being a $3$ -palindrome: Being palindromic in bases $b,b+1,b+2$ . I have no examples in this case. They are either very large, or do not exist for some unexpected reason. I have searched for the smallest example for $F_9$ , and it has to be $\gt 10^{17}$ , so far. Haven't searched significantly in cases $F_d,d\ge 11$ . Q: Can we provide arguments why they would (not) exist? I'm not sure how can one attempt to search for these solutions other than filtering out generated palindromes - there should be a better way, since the solutions for $d=3,5,7$ are very nicely characterized by $F_3,F_5,F_7$ , and $d\ge9$ should follow similarly? Q: How efficiently can we search/solve for elements in $F_d,d\ge9$ ? $[1]:$ Proof for $F_3$ , the $d=3$ digit $3$ -palindromes I believe I was able to show that $F_3$ contains all solutions for $d=3$ . But I haven't been able to fully analyze $d=5,7,9$ in a similar way. The idea is in short simple and natural: All palindromes with three digits are given with $Ab^2+Bb+A$ where $A,B<b$ . We can rewrite that as: $A(b+1)^2+(B-2A)(b+1)+(2A-B)$ , Now we can search for $2$ -palindromes first, numbers palindromic in bases $b,b+1$ : We need now to satisfy (looking at digits of the rewritten expression): $$1\le A-\alpha_1\le b$$ $$0\le B-2A +\alpha_1 (b+1) -\alpha_2 \le b$$ $$1\le 2A-B +\alpha_2 (b+1) \le b$$ To have a valid number, and to have a valid palindrome in base $b+1$ : $$A-\alpha_1=2A-B+\alpha_2 (b+1)$$ Where $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in\mathbb Z$ are freely used to ""borrow"" from and to neighbouring digits, to satisfy the first three conditions depending on $b,A,B$ . We can parametrize then all the $3$ -digit numbers in base $b+1$ with some $t\in\mathbb N$ : (After preforming the trivial borrowing, we are observing bases $b+t,b+t+1$ ) (Omitted the new $\alpha_1,\alpha_2$ gotten after trivial borrowing, from expressions, for readability) And after this, we can show that the numbers on and below yellow line can't give base $b+1$ palindromes, and after further analysis and playing with conditions, one can show that $3$ -palindromes must be numbers of forms located on green and blue lines. Now we do the same thing, but for $b+1,b+2$ and considering only the blue and green forms, and after final analysis, one can finally prove and show that $F_3$ contains all $d=3$ digit $3$ -palindromes, and that $d=3$ digit $4$ -palindromes do not exist. More specifically, the blue forms yield solution $300$ (see $F_3$ ), and the green forms yield the solutions generated by $b_3(b)$ that makes up the rest of $F_3$ . Q: Can we apply similar analysis to $d=5,7,9,\dots$ and solve/prove $F_d$ ? A: I asked this question some time ago here . - not answered . Here you can also see this proof in more detail. My poof for $d=3$ relied on guessing the right cases to split the parameterized forms into, and then solving each of those cases, splitting into subcases if necessary, until the proof contained all parameterized forms. I wasn't able to guess $d=5$ cases that would allow the parameterized forms to be analyzed and $F_5$ found. Notice that if we were to use a similar image as above for form visualization, to help us guess the cases to analyze, we would now have for $d=5$ , a 3-dimensional matrix of parameterized forms with $t$ , and $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4$ parameters. I'm not sure how to transform this into a rigorous method to allow me to attack $d=5,7,9,\dots$ Clarification: If you can provide insight into $d\le 9$ , then refer to the linked question . If you can provide insight into $d\ge 9$ and $d=7$ regarding $F_7^{(m)}$ for $m\gt7$ , refer to this question.","Question Let be a number with digits when written in number base .

The proof uses Weil's converse theorem and the functional equation of the Hecke $L$ -function. The author proved the case of modular forms, i.e. when $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field and left the real case as an exercise.

Because of my limited knowledge of TREE(k) and ordinals I decided to post a question here first before submitting my answer. You can view the code and a limited explanation here but I will define and  explain the D function here. Notation My program is highly recursive, it produces functions to put inside other functions. $\omega_0=0$,  $\omega_1=\omega$,  $\omega_1=\Omega$,... $\alpha_n$ means $cf(\alpha)=\omega_n$ so $\alpha_0$ means $\alpha$ is a natural number I will represent ordinals as functions (in lambda calculus) which their fundamental sequence (e.g. $\omega_1\cdot 2=\lambda x_0. \omega_1+x_0$) and call these functions using square brackets e.g. $(\omega_1\cdot 2)[5]=\omega+5$ Definition $\omega_n=\lambda \alpha_k. \alpha_k$ with $k<n$ $\alpha_n+1=\lambda \beta_n. \alpha_n$ $D_\alpha(\beta)=H'_\alpha(H'_\alpha(\beta))=H'^{2}_\alpha(\beta)$ $H'_0(\alpha_n)=\alpha_n+1$ $H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\beta_k)=D_{H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\omega_n)}(\beta_k)$ if $k<n$ $H'_{\alpha_{n+1}}(\beta_n)=D_{\alpha_{n+1}[\beta_n]}(\beta_n)$ $H'_{\alpha_0+1}(\beta_n)=D_{\alpha_0}(\beta_n)$ $H'_{\alpha_{k+1}}(\beta_n)=\lambda \gamma_k. D_{\alpha_{k+1}[\gamma_k]}(\beta_n)$ if $0\le k<n$ My number is $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ but I can easily change it to $D_{\omega_{10^9}}(9)$ if required. In words $\omega_n$ is the identity function for ordinals of smaller cofanity. The successor of $\alpha$ is the function that returns $\alpha$ for all input (this is to avoid having to handle successor and limit ordinals separately ) $D$ is the doubling function it iterates $H'$ once. This is a balance between the hardy hierarchy , which doesn't iterate at all, and the fast-growing hierarchy , which iterates n times. $H'_0$ is the successor function, both for functions and numbers $H'_\alpha(\beta)$ : if the domain of $\alpha$ is so large a size smaller could still fit $\beta$, use $H'$ on $\alpha$ until the domain is just large enough. (this is a way to avoid having multiple calls to H' in my code e.g. $\alpha_1=H'_{\omega_2}(\omega_1)$ and $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is just large enough use $\alpha[\beta]$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is too small : if $\alpha$ is an integer use it's predecessor. else define the result to be the function that uses $\alpha[\gamma]$ as the new subscript when $\gamma$ is put in. The result has the same domain as $\alpha$ note : $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_m \text{ if } m\le n \text{ or } n=0$ $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_n \text{ if } n<m$ The ordinal interpretation You don't have to read this is you don't want. The question is if $D_{\omega_9}(9)>TREE(3)$. But I want to give some more explanation for why I believe my number is bigger than TREE(3). The functions in program have strong similarities with ordinals This is the definition for the set of tree-ordinals with order type $n$: $$\alpha\in T_n \Leftrightarrow  \begin{cases} \alpha=0\\ \alpha=\beta+1 \text{ and } \beta\in T_n\\ \alpha:T_k\mapsto T_n \text{ with } k<n\\ \end{cases}$$ Note $T_k \subset T_n \text{ if } k<n$ but except for this it perfectly aligns with the explanation I gave earlier. $T_0$ is still the set of natural numbers, since the 3rd rule, which generates all the limit ordinals, can't be used yet. My definition of $\omega_n$ is different than usual, usually $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal ($\Omega$) but for me that's $\omega_2$ I did this to keep $\alpha_n \in T_n$ Notation interpreted as ordinals $\alpha_{k}$ is an ordinal with  order type k ( $k=\min(n:\alpha\in T_n)$ ) $\alpha_n[\beta_k]$ is the $\beta$th element of $\alpha$'s fundamental sequence. This is defined when $k<n$. The ordinal idea behind my number I believe $\omega_9$ acts as on ordinal about the size of $\tau[9]$ in $H'$. Since $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$, My number $D_{\omega_9}(9)=H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)\approx H'^{2}_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{ϑ(Ω^ω ω)+1}(9)>TREE(9)$ $H'$ is a modified version of the Hardy Hierarchy . The idea behind $H'$ is that $H'_{\alpha+1}$ = $H'^{2}_{\alpha}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\alpha_n+\omega_n} \text{ iterates } H'_{\alpha_n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$. You can find a proof here . Than the idea of an ordinal hierarchy was expended from a using a countable ordinal to generate huge integers, to use huge $\alpha_{n+1}$ to generate huge $\beta_n$. The 5th definition was than added to iterate $H'$ on the ordinal slot. If I did this correctly this should mean that $H'_{\omega_{n+k}}(n)>f_\tau(n)$ for some reasonably small k. Examples These early expansions created a lot of insight into my function for me, so I'll post them here too. Some very early expansions The 5th definition makes $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ expand to $H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(D_{\alpha_1}(9)))))))))$ $= H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(H_{\alpha_1}(D_{\alpha_1[9]}(9))))))))))$ $$\alpha_8=H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)=D_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)=H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))$$ \begin{align} \ \alpha_7 & = H'_{\alpha_8}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{\alpha_8[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{D_{\omega_8[\omega_7]}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{D_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))}(\omega_7) \\ & = H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(\omega_7))\\ \end{align} \begin{align} \ \alpha_6 & =H'_{\alpha_7}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = D_{\alpha_7[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = D_{H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(\omega_7))[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = \ ... \end{align} $$\alpha_5=H'_{\alpha_6}(\omega_5)$$ $$\alpha_4=H'_{\alpha_5}(\omega_4)$$ $$\alpha_3=H'_{\alpha_4}(\omega_3)$$ $$\alpha_2=H'_{\alpha_3}(\omega_2)$$ $$\alpha_1=H'_{\alpha_2}(\omega_1)$$ If you want too truly experience the madness I recommend trying to work out $\alpha_1[3]$ but I didn't get very far. Some very approximate expansions \begin{align} D_{\omega_9}(9) & = H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)  \\  & > H'_{\omega_9}(9) \\   & = D_{H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)}(9) \\  & > D_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\   & > H'_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\  & > H'_{\omega_{7}^2}(9)\\  & > H'_{2 ↑^{\omega_{6}} \omega_{6}}(9)\\  & >  ... \end{align} Conclusion I couldn't get past $\omega_6$ and I ignored all the iteration of D so once $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ is finally reached the computer will have to work back up trough all of those extra iterations too. But that wouldn't even be necessary because $f_{ϑ(Ω^ω ω)}(9)>TREE(3)$ so if $\alpha_1>ϑ(Ω^ω ω)$ my number should be big enough. So is $\alpha_1>ϑ(Ω^ω ω)$?

(this is a way to avoid having multiple calls to H' in my code e.g. $\alpha_1=H'_{\omega_2}(\omega_1)$ and $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is just large enough use $\alpha[\beta]$ if the domain of $\alpha$ is too small : if $\alpha$ is an integer use it's predecessor. else define the result to be the function that uses $\alpha[\gamma]$ as the new subscript when $\gamma$ is put in. The result has the same domain as $\alpha$ note : $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_m \text{ if } m\le n \text{ or } n=0$ $H'_{\alpha_n}(\beta_m) \in T_n \text{ if } n<m$ The ordinal interpretation You don't have to read this is you don't want. The question is if $D_{\omega_9}(9)>TREE(3)$. But I want to give some more explanation for why I believe my number is bigger than TREE(3). The functions in program have strong similarities with ordinals This is the definition for the set of tree-ordinals with order type $n$: $$\alpha\in T_n \Leftrightarrow  \begin{cases} \alpha=0\\ \alpha=\beta+1 \text{ and } \beta\in T_n\\ \alpha:T_k\mapsto T_n \text{ with } k<n\\ \end{cases}$$ Note $T_k \subset T_n \text{ if } k<n$ but except for this it perfectly aligns with the explanation I gave earlier. $T_0$ is still the set of natural numbers, since the 3rd rule, which generates all the limit ordinals, can't be used yet. My definition of $\omega_n$ is different than usual, usually $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal ($\Omega$) but for me that's $\omega_2$ I did this to keep $\alpha_n \in T_n$ Notation interpreted as ordinals $\alpha_{k}$ is an ordinal with  order type k ( $k=\min(n:\alpha\in T_n)$ ) $\alpha_n[\beta_k]$ is the $\beta$th element of $\alpha$'s fundamental sequence. This is defined when $k<n$. The ordinal idea behind my number I believe $\omega_9$ acts as on ordinal about the size of $\tau[9]$ in $H'$. Since $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$, My number $D_{\omega_9}(9)=H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)\approx H'^{2}_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{\tau[9]}(9)>f_{ϑ(Ω^ω ω)+1}(9)>TREE(9)$ $H'$ is a modified version of the Hardy Hierarchy . The idea behind $H'$ is that $H'_{\alpha+1}$ = $H'^{2}_{\alpha}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\alpha_n+\omega_n} \text{ iterates } H'_{\alpha_n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $H'_{\omega*\alpha}(n)>f_\alpha(n)$. You can find a proof here . Than the idea of an ordinal hierarchy was expended from a using a countable ordinal to generate huge integers, to use huge $\alpha_{n+1}$ to generate huge $\beta_n$. The 5th definition was than added to iterate $H'$ on the ordinal slot. If I did this correctly this should mean that $H'_{\omega_{n+k}}(n)>f_\tau(n)$ for some reasonably small k. Examples These early expansions created a lot of insight into my function for me, so I'll post them here too. Some very early expansions The 5th definition makes $D_{\omega_9}(9)$ expand to $H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(D_{\alpha_1}(9)))))))))$ $= H'_{\omega_9}(H'_{\alpha_8}(H'_{\alpha_7}(H'_{\alpha_6}(H'_{\alpha_5}(H'_{\alpha_4}(H'_{\alpha_3}(H'_{\alpha_2}(H_{\alpha_1}(D_{\alpha_1[9]}(9))))))))))$ $$\alpha_8=H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)=D_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)=H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))$$ \begin{align} \ \alpha_7 & = H'_{\alpha_8}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{\alpha_8[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{H'_{\omega_8}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))[\omega_7]}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{D_{\omega_8[\omega_7]}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))}(\omega_7) \\ & = D_{D_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8))}(\omega_7) \\ & = H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(\omega_7))\\ \end{align} \begin{align} \ \alpha_6 & =H'_{\alpha_7}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = D_{\alpha_7[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = D_{H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(H'_{H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_7}(H'_{\omega_8}(\omega_8)))}(\omega_7))[\omega_6]}(\omega_6) \\ \ & = \ ... \end{align} $$\alpha_5=H'_{\alpha_6}(\omega_5)$$ $$\alpha_4=H'_{\alpha_5}(\omega_4)$$ $$\alpha_3=H'_{\alpha_4}(\omega_3)$$ $$\alpha_2=H'_{\alpha_3}(\omega_2)$$ $$\alpha_1=H'_{\alpha_2}(\omega_1)$$ If you want too truly experience the madness I recommend trying to work out $\alpha_1[3]$ but I didn't get very far. Some very approximate expansions \begin{align} D_{\omega_9}(9) & = H'^{2}_{\omega_9}(9)  \\  & > H'_{\omega_9}(9) \\   & = D_{H'_{\omega_9}(\omega_8)}(9) \\  & > D_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\   & > H'_{\omega_{8}*2}(9) \\  & > H'_{\omega_{7}^2}(9)\\  & > H'_{2 ↑^{\omega_{6}} \omega_{6}}(9)\\  & >  ... \end{align} Conclusion I couldn't get past $\omega_6$ and I ignored all the iteration of D so once $H'_{\alpha_1}(9)$ is finally reached the computer will have to work back up trough all of those extra iterations too. But that wouldn't even be necessary because $f_{ϑ(Ω^ω ω)}(9)>TREE(3)$ so if $\alpha_1>ϑ(Ω^ω ω)$ my number should be big enough. So is $\alpha_1>ϑ(Ω^ω ω)$?

80,Structure Sheaves of Rigid Analytic Spaces: What is the right Value Category?,Structure Sheaves of Rigid Analytic Spaces: What is the right Value Category?,,"Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field and let $X$ be an affinoid $K$-space. Then the structure sheaf $\mathcal O_X$ of $X$ is defined first on the ""weak Grothendieck topology"", ie on affinoid subdomains, and then by extending the sheaf to the finer ""strong Grothendieck topology"" $\mathcal T$, also called Tate topology. Now while on affinoid subdomains $U\subset X$, the structure sheaf takes values $\mathcal O_X(U)$ in affinoid $K$-algebras, this is not necessarily true any more for general admissible opens, because for instance the value category needs to have arbitrary Cartesian products. In most of the literature I have seen,  the structure sheaf is therefore considered as a functor $$\mathcal O_X: \text{Cat} \mathcal T \longrightarrow K{-}Alg$$ from the underlying category of the Grothendieck topology to just $K$-algebras. Consequently, rigid spaces are later defined to be certain spaces carrying sheaves of locally ringed $K$-algebras. Although I can believe that this works perfectly well, I somehow feel that in doing so we forget some of the structure of $\mathcal O_X(U)$ even for general admissible opens. My question is therefore: What category does $\mathcal O_X$ naturally take values in? In other words, does $\mathcal O_X$ factor through some forgetful functor to $K{-}Alg$? The reason I am asking is that for the examples I first thought of, I always seem to get at least Banach $K$-algebras, although not necessarily topologically of finite type over $K$. If you just read until here and you think you might know an answer to the question,  I would be very happy to get an answer from you, you don't need to read any further. If on the other hand you think that this is an unreasonable question, let me add a few more words about why I think we might get more structure: The way that $\mathcal O_X$ is extended to the finer Grothendieck topology is by a Lemma about sheaves on Grothendieck topologies, so my rigid geometry books don't give all the technicalities. But I think the way this works is by defining $\mathcal O_X(U)$ for an admissible open $U\subset X$ to be the limit $$\varinjlim_{\mathfrak U} H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X)$$ where $\mathfrak U = (U_i)_{i \in I}$ ranges over all admissible coverings by affinoid open subsets of $X$, partially ordered by refinement, and where $$ H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X) = \ker \left( \prod_{i \in I} \mathcal O_X(U_i) \rightrightarrows \prod_{i,j \in I} \mathcal O_X(U_i\cap U_j) \right).$$ So $K$-algebras is a sensible choice for the value category because it has both direct limits and Cartesian products. Banach $K$-algebras doesn't have direct limits (I think), but since $ H^0(\mathfrak U,\mathcal O_X)$ is the kernel of a continuous map from a product of Banach $K$-algebras, it is a Banach $K$-algebra at least in some cases. So maybe we are only taking ""lucky limits"" for which some of the topological structure is preserved? Let me give an example: Let $A = K\langle \zeta\rangle$, $X = Sp(A)$ the unit disc and consider the set $$D(\zeta) = \{x \in X \mid |\zeta(x)|>0\}$$ ie the unit disc pointed at the origin. Then if I am not mistaken, the functions on this subspace are $$\mathcal O_X(D(\zeta)) = \left\{\sum_{n\in \mathbb Z}a_n\zeta^n \middle | |a_n|\to 0 \text{ for } n\to \infty\text{, and }x^n|a_{-n}|\to 0 \text{ for } n\to \infty\text{ and any }x\in \mathbb R_{>0}\right\}$$ which is indeed complete wrt the natural extension of the Gauss-norm. Here I think that we may be taking advantage of the fact that a neighborhood basis of the origin is given by Weierstraß-domains, and that we can therefore always find a refining covering of the form $\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb N}X(\zeta^{-1};\epsilon^n)$ for some $\epsilon>0$. In particular, $\mathcal O_X(D(\zeta))$ is an inverse limit of Banach-$K$-algebras and therefore again a Banach-$K$-algebra. This makes me wonder: Does the answer to the above question change if we restrict $\mathcal O_X$ to the Zariski topology?","Let $K$ be a complete non-archimedean field and let $X$ be an affinoid $K$-space. Then the structure sheaf $\mathcal O_X$ of $X$ is defined first on the ""weak Grothendieck topology"", ie on affinoid subdomains, and then by extending the sheaf to the finer ""strong Grothendieck topology"" $\mathcal T$, also called Tate topology. Now while on affinoid subdomains $U\subset X$, the structure sheaf takes values $\mathcal O_X(U)$ in affinoid $K$-algebras, this is not necessarily true any more for general admissible opens, because for instance the value category needs to have arbitrary Cartesian products.

Subtracting (2) - (1') we then get: $((ak \ \text{mod}\  2^{1024}) s_2 - lk \cdot s_1) = m_2 - m_1 \cdot l - b \cdot s_2$ If the reduction modulo $2^{1024}$ wasn't there, it would be trivial from here to recover $k$ because it is the only unknown value in the equation. With it however, I don't know how to proceed.",,"['number-theory', 'cryptography']"

So far I've tested a few irreducible polynomials using mathematica, and this has held. The motivation is to use this as a test for irreducibility, as if $f(x)$ is not irreducible then it takes on at most $2n$ prime values, as either factor takes on $1$ or $-1$ at most $2n$ times. (I'd also be interested in learning if this bound can be improved).
