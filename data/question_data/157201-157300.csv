For theoretical purposes, this is fine since $J(x)=\Theta(\pi(x))$ and we can recover $\pi(x)$ by Möbius inversion $\pi(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}J(x^{1/n}).$ This is the reason why Riemann's suggestion $R(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\mathrm{Li}(x^{1/n})$ is a good candidate for an approximation to $\pi(x)$, and indeed performs well empirically (though it is not really superior by any general measure). My question is: Can we plug the explicit formula for $\mathrm{Li}(x)$ into the inversion formula for $\pi(x)$ and evaluate term-wise? This would lead to $\pi(x)=R(x)-\sum_{\varrho}R(x^\varrho)+\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\int_{x^{1/n}}^\infty\frac{\mathrm{d}t}{t(t^2-1)\log t}-\log2\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}.$ The sum $\sum\frac{\mu(n)}{n}$ actually evaluates to $0$, so the last term would vanish. But since the sum over the zeta zeros converges only conditionally, I am not sure if swapping the order of summation in the second term would be justified and correct. What's more, the lower bound $x^{1/n}$ for the integral converges to $1$ (for a fixed $x$), where the integrand has a pole, hence the integral would blow up to infinity (quicker than the $1/n$ can fix), and so this sum would not converge (as far as I can see and my calculations support). Do I make a mistake in my logic, or is term-wise evaluation indeed not allowed here? Another approach is of course to argue that the inversion sum is actually finite, since $J(x)=0$ for $x<2$ by construction, so we won't run into the convergence problem (but will neither have the convenience that the $\log2$ term vanishes).

Can anyone spot my mistake? Suppose $F$ is a field with four elements, as $0, 1, a, a^2$, and $\chi$ a nontrivial character on $F$.  Thus we must have $\chi(0) = 0, \chi(1) = 1$, and we can assume $\chi(a) = \zeta$ and $\chi(a^2) = \zeta^2$, where $\zeta = e^{2\pi i /3}$.  This is because $\chi$ sends a nonzero member of $F$ to a third root of unity, so the only other homomorphism (which would be $\chi^2$) would interchange where $a$ and $a^2$ are sent. Now the Gauss sum of $\chi$ is given by $g(\chi) = \sum\limits_{t \in F} \chi(t)\zeta^{tr(t)}$, where $tr$ is the trace function, defined by $tr(t) = t + t^2$.

But $\zeta^2 = e^{2 \pi i (2/3)} = Cos(4 \pi / 3) + i Sin(4 \pi / 3) = -1/2 - i\sqrt{3}/2$, whence $g(\chi) = 1.5 - \sqrt{3}i/2$, meaning $|g(\chi)| = \sqrt{2.25 + 3/4} = \sqrt{3}$.

I'm not sure this is relevant here, but for any such $p$ there is a symmetric matrix $A$ such that $p(\vec x)= (\vec x)^T A(\vec x)$, where we think of $\vec x$ as a column vector. $p$ is positive definite iff $p(\vec x)>0$ whenever $\vec x\ne 0$. The form is integer valued iff $p(\vec a)\in{\mathbb Z}$ whenever $\vec a\in {\mathbb Z}^n$. For short, let's say ""form"" instead of ""positive definite integer valued quadratic form"". A form is universal iff it represents every positive integer, i.e., for all $m>0$ there is $\vec a\in{\mathbb Z}^n$ with $p(\vec a)=m$. For example , $p_1$ above is universal.

Then  has no solution.,p \geq 5 2p+1 \phi(n)=2p,"I am studying for my number theory final by doing past exams. The question is Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime. Prove that if $2p+1$ not a prime. Then $\phi(n)=2p$ has no solution. ( $\phi$ is Euler Totient function). In the case where $2p+1$ is prime, find all solutions to $\phi(n)=2p$ . I managed to 'prove' the first part, however without using the $2p+1$ not prime assumption. I spot if $2p+1$ is prime then $\phi(2p+1)=2p$ , assuming the first part this shows that $\phi(n)=2p$ has solutions $\iff 2p+1$ is prime. But how to find all solutions? So clearly the $2p+1$ not prime assumption is needed. So my proof is wrong but I can't see where it fails (edit: as pointed out I just missed a case, the proof itself is not wrong). Can someone show me where it fails, and or provide an alternative. My proof: Let $n=2^a\prod_{i=1}^tp_i^{\alpha_i}$ be the prime factorisation of $n$ with $a\geq 0$ , and $p_i$ odd primes. Assume that $\phi(n)=2p$ . Know that $$\phi(n)=\phi(2^a)\prod_{i=1}^t\phi(p_i^{\alpha_i})=2p.$$ If $t\geq 2$ , then $4 \mid 2p$ , since $\phi(p_i^{\alpha_i})$ is even. Hence we must have $t < 2$ . If $t=0$ then $\phi(n)=2^{a-1} \neq 2p$ . So we must have that $t=1$ and so we have $$n=2^ap_1^{\alpha_1}.$$ If $a>2$ then $ 4 \mid \phi(2^a) \mid 2p$ , which is a contradiction. So we must have $a \leq 2$ . If $a=0$ or $a=1$ , then $\phi(2^a)=1$ and we have $\phi(n)=p_1^{\alpha_1-1}(p_1-1)=2p$ . Hence $p_1-1=2$ and $p=p_1^{\alpha_1-1}$ , which leads to $p_1=p=3$ , which is a contradiction. Hence we must have $a=2$ , i.e $n=4p_1^{\alpha_1}$ . Then $\phi(n)=2p_1^{\alpha_1-1}(p_1-1)=2p$ . Which implies $p_1^{\alpha_1-1}(p_1-1)=p$ . So either $p_1-1=p$ , in which case they are consecutive primes, contradiction as $p\geq 5$ . Or $p_1^{\alpha_1-1}=p$ and $p_1-1=1$ , which leads to $p_1=p=2$ , also a contradiction. So all cases lead to a contradiction.","I am studying for my number theory final by doing past exams.
