The Question: Consider f( x ) , a general quadratic function in standard form, and g( x ) its reciprocal. For which values of x are the slopes of their respective tangent lines equal? Consider two cases: one where it is true for exactly one value of x , and the other where it is true for exactly two values of x . In the latter case, you can assume that the steepness a does not equal 0 of f( x ) is equal to both it’s y -intercept and also to the slope of its tangent at x = 1 . Find the required conditions on the parameters a , b , c in terms of a . My Progress So Far: So I know that $f(x) = ax^2 +bx + c$ and $g(x) = 1/f(x)$ . After I solved for the derivative of each function, I set them both equal to each other and started solving for it. But then I came to a equation of $(ax^2 + bx + c)^2 = -1$ and that doesn't work. Next I tried something else. Since I know from the 2nd case that $f(x) = c$ and $f(x) = f'(1)$ when a cannot equal 0, I set $c = f'(1)$ and got $c = 2a + b$ . But after that, I don't know where to go. I'm not expecting a full solution, but if anyone could give me a hint for solving this question, I would appreciate it. I know that it says to write everything in terms of a, but I'm not sure how to approach that method.","Recently, my Calculus and Vectors (Grade 12) teacher gave our class a thinking question/assignment to work on over the march break, and after working on for some time, I've become stuck on it.

78,Proving differentiability by testing continuity of the partials?,Proving differentiability by testing continuity of the partials?,,"This is question 54 from Section 2.3 of Susan Jane Colley's Vector Calculus. I need to determine whether the function is differentiable at the point $(a,b) = (1, 0)$ $$ f(x,y) = \big((x-1)y\big)^{2/3} $$ So my attempt at this began with checking the partial derivatives for continuity. If the partial derivatives are not continuous then $f$ fails to be differentiable. $$ f_x(x, y) = \frac{2y}{3\big((x-1)y \big)^{1/3}}\\\\ f_y(x, y) = \frac{2(x-1)}{3\big((x-1)y \big)^{1/3}} $$ Given the both partials are not defined at $(a,b) = (1,0)$ , then I determined $f$ is not differentiable. However, I took a look at the solution manual it asserts that the function is indeed differentiable. I have provided her proof of this below. Solutions The solution manual asserts that $$ f(x,0) \equiv 0 \Rightarrow f_x(1, 0) = 0\\\\ f(1,y) \equiv 0 \Rightarrow f_y(1, 0) = 0 $$ The tangent plane $h(x, y) = f(1,0) + f_x(1, 0)(x-1) + f_y(1, 0)(y-0) = 0$ . Thus, for $(x,y) \neq (1,0)$ we have that $$ 0 \leq \frac{|f(x,y) - h(x,y)|}{||(x,y) - (1,0)||} = \frac{|f(x,y)|}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2}} $$ Then $$ |f(x,y)| = |x-1|^{2/3}|y|^{2/3} \leq ((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{1/3}((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{1/3}\\\\ = ((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{2/3} $$ Thus, $$ \frac{|f(x,y)|}{\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2}} \leq \frac{((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{2/3}}{((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{1/2}} = ((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{1/6} $$ Because the last expression approaches zero as $(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)$ then $f$ must be differentiable at $(1,0)$ I have several questions Could you explain why despite the fact the partial derivatives are not continuous at $(a,b) = (1,0)$ , we go on to assert differentiability? Why does $f(x,0) \equiv 0$ mean that $f_x(1, 0) = 0$ ? The argument on the tangent plane is confusing. We say $h(1,0) = 0$ but the proof goes on to say ""For $(x,y) \neq (1,0)$ "" and then proceeds to use $h(x)$ at $(1,0)$ In the line beginning $|f(x,y)$ , what identity is this being used? In the final argument, is this some variation of the squeeze theorem in that if $\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,0)}((x-1)^2 + y^2)^{1/6} = 0$ then since this is greater than or equal to $|f(x,y)| = |x-1|^{2/3}|y|^{2/3}$ , then its limit must also be zero?

Proof : Let $0.25<x<0.27$ then define : $$g(x)=x^{x^{x^{x}}}$$ $g(x)$ is convex . Proof : Fact 1: On $(0.25,0.27)$ the function $k(x)=x^x$ is convex Proof : Left to the reader using derivatives and logarithm . Fact 2 : On $(0.25,0.27)$ the function $l(x)=x^{x^x}$ is concave increasing Proof : Trick : we consider the function $l(x)=x^{k(x)}$ we have : $$l''(x)=x^{k(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) k''(x) + 2 x k'(x) + (x \ln(x) k'(x) + k(x))^2 - k(x))$$ Now we have as obvious things : $$x^2 \ln(x) k''(x)<0$$ $$2xk'(x)<0$$ $$(x \ln(x) k'(x) + k(x))^2 - k(x)<\left(0.25\ln\left(0.25\right)k'\left(0.25\right)+k\left(0.25\right)\right)^{2}-k\left(0.27\right)<0$$ So the function is indeed concave and we deduce that $l(x)$ is increasing . Fact 3: Now we consider the function : $$g(x)=x^{l(x)}$$ We have : $$g''(x)=x^{l(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) l''(x) + 2 x l'(x) + (x \ln(x) l'(x) + l(x))^2 - l(x))$$ A calculation gives : $$l'(x)>1.15$$ So : $$2xl'(x)>0.5\cdot 1.15$$ In the same vein we have : $$2 x l'(x) + (x \ln(x) l'(x) + l(x))^2 - l(x)>2\cdot0.25\cdot1.15+\left(0.25\ln\left(0.25\right)l'\left(0.27\right)+l\left(0.27\right)\right)^{2}-l\left(0.27\right)>0$$ So the function $g(x)$ is convex . We are done. Fact 4 : Now we introduce the function : $$h(x)=x^{g(x)}$$ We have : $$h''(x)=x^{g(x) - 2} (x^2 \ln(x) g''(x) + 2 x g'(x) + (x \ln(x) g'(x) + g(x))^2 - g(x))$$ As $g''(x)>0$ then $x^2 \ln(x) g''(x)<0$ We have again $g'(x)<0$ and It's not hard to show $(x \ln(x) g'(x) + g(x))^2 - g(x)<0$ using again particular values I mean maximize and minimize the different functions .

Here's a problem on differentiability at a point and continuity of the derivative function at the same point. I'm stating the problem and presenting my solution to it. I'm not entirely confident on my solution (especially about interchanging the limits). So I'd greatly appreciate if someone checks the solution and tell me if there's any gap in my arguments. Thank you. The Problem : Let $f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ and is differentiable except possibly at $c \in (a,b)$. Assume that $\lim_{x \to c} f'(x)$ exists. Show that $f'(c)$ exists and $f'$ is continuous at $c$. My Approach : Given that $\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)$ exists, we can write \begin{align} \lim_{x \to c}f'(x)&=\lim_{x \to c} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\ &=\lim_{h \to 0} \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} ~~\text{[Since the double-limit exists]}\\ &=\lim_{h \to 0} \Big[\frac{1}{h} \cdot \lim_{x \to c}\big\{f(x+h)-f(x)\big\}\Big]\\ &=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} ~~\text{[Since $f$ is continuous]}\\ \end{align} Since $\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)$ exists, so does $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h},$ i.e. $f'(c)$.
