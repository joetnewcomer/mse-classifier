1,How is geometry defined using ZFC?,How is geometry defined using ZFC?,,"I've been trying to get a rigorous understanding for the mathematical concepts I learned in high school. I've been reading about how the real numbers can be constructed from the axioms of ZFC, but I can't find any information on geometry.

I've read definitions of Euclidean spaces as sets, but I don't see how it's isomorphic to the synthetic geometry taught in high school. I'd like to be able to know the answers to questions such as: How is the concept of ""angle"" defined? I thought ZFC was the foundation for most of modern mathematics?

My goal is to know that synthetic geometry is isomorphic to something analytically defined using ZFC, so I can know that any proofs in synthetic geometry will also hold in ZFC.

3,Decomposable Families of Shapes,Decomposable Families of Shapes,,"There are two types of golden triangles in the world, as shown in the following picture: Here $\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ denotes the golden ratio.

The golden triangles are the case where $n=5$.) In general, we say that a finite family of (similarity classes of) polygons is decomposable if each polygon in the family can be decomposed into two polygons from the family in at least two different ways. So here are my questions: What are some other decomposable families of polygons? Does this property (or something similar) already have a name in the literature?  Where can I look this up? Are there any decomposable families of shapes in the plane whose members are not polygons?  For example, do there exist any finite decomposable families of fractal shapes?

If $a,b,c$ are non-collinear and $(a,b,c)\in C$ then $(\mu(a,b,c),b,c)\in C$ as well and $\mu(\mu(a,b,c),b,c)=a$ (so given $\{a,b,c,\mu(a,b,c)\}$ we cannot tell which three points were the original vertices).

12,Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals Proof Inversion,Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals Proof Inversion,,"Two weeks ago our professor taught us the Japanese theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals . It states that the inscribed centres of the four triangles formed by two sides and a diagonal of a cyclic quadrilateral always form a rectangle. After the proof he mentioned that he was convinced that the reverse also holds, that is, that whenever the incircle centres form a rectangle the outer quadrilateral is a cyclic quadrilateral, but he never managed to prove it. After finding absolutely nothing on the internet about the inversion of the Japanese theorem, I set out to prove it myself. The big problem is that the construction of the rectangle is not unique, many different chordal quadrilaterals have the same rectangle of incircle centres. Since there is thus no construction rule in the opposite direction, all my elementary geometric attempts have failed. So I came up with the idea of a purely arithmetic proof for the Japanese theorem. In the hope that, unlike the geometric proof, it works in both directions. Without limiting generality, I have given the four vertices of the chord quadrilateral the following coordinates: $A (0, 0), B (1, 0), C(x_c, y_c), D(x_d, y_d)$ . This is possible because by moving and scaling in the coordinate system alone, any quadrilateral can be brought into this shape. The simple values for A and B simplify the calculation enormously.

But it is very sparse and the counterexample presented in the only answer is invalid because the vertices of the rectangle do not coincide with the inscribed centres.","A (0, 0), B (1, 0), C(x_c, y_c), D(x_d, y_d) x_c, y_c, x_d, y_d \overrightarrow{M_1M_2} =    \left(\begin{array}{c}      \frac{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + x_c}{\sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + 1} - \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}+ x_d}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}}\\      \frac{y_c}{\sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + 1} - \frac{y_d}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}}    \end{array}\right) \overrightarrow{M_2M_3} =     \left(\begin{array}{c}      \frac{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} \cdot x_c + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} \cdot x_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2}} - \frac{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + x_c}{\sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + 1}\\      \frac{\sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} \cdot y_c + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} \cdot y_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2}} - \frac{y_c}{\sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} + 1}    \end{array}\right) \overrightarrow{M_3M_4} =    \left(\begin{array}{c}       \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} \cdot x_c + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} \cdot x_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2}} - \frac{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} \cdot x_c + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} \cdot x_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2}}\\       \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} \cdot y_c + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} \cdot y_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2}} - \frac{\sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} \cdot y_c + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2} \cdot y_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{1 + x_c^2 - 2x_c + y_c^2}}     \end{array}\right) \overrightarrow{M_4M_1} =     \left(\begin{array}{c}       \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}+ x_d}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}} - \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} \cdot x_c + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} \cdot x_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2}}\\        \frac{y_d}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x_d^2 - 2x_d + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2}} - \frac{\sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} \cdot y_c + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2} \cdot y_d}{\sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_d^2 + y_d^2 - 2x_cx_d - 2y_cy_d} + \sqrt{x_d^2 + y_d^2} + \sqrt{x_c^2 + y_c^2}}    \end{array}\right)","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'quadrilateral']"

14,Best fit ellipsoid,Best fit ellipsoid,,"Given a collection of points $P \subset \mathbb R^3$, a crude characterization of the ""shape"" of $P$ is sometimes given by the principal components. We construct a covariance matrix, e.g., if $P$ is discrete, $C = \displaystyle\sum_{p\in P} (p - \mu)(p - \mu)^\intercal$, where $\mu = \displaystyle\frac1{|P|}\sum_{p\in P}\, p$ is the centre of mass. This defines an ellipsoid whose semi-axis are defined by the unit eigenvectors of $C$, scaled by the associated eigenvalues. My question is concerned with the following statement: The ellipsoid described by the principal components is the best fit   ellipsoid for $P$. Unfortunately, I don't know of any author or resource that I can accuse of explicitly making such a claim$^*$.  Anyway, my question is: Is there a natural geometric definition of ""best fit ellipsoid"" for   which the above statement becomes true? For example, some kind of least squares or other variational characterization of this same ellipsoid is what I am looking for. I would also accept an answer that convinces me that this is the wrong way to be looking at the principal components, but that will be a tough sell. If we do a coordinate translation, so that $v_p = (p - \mu)$, and let $\hat{v}_p = \frac{v_p}{\left\|v_p\right\|}$, and look at $C$ as a linear transformation which is the sum of the rank one operators in this coordinate system, $C = \displaystyle\sum_{p \in P} \left\|v_p\right\|^2 \hat{v}_p\hat{v}_p^\intercal$, then the ellipsoid in question is the image of the unit ball.

I am looking for a better understanding, preferably from a geometric perspective. * Wikipedia comes close to such a claim in the description of the moments : ""The 'second moment', ... in higher dimensions measures the shape of a cloud of points as it could be fit by an ellipsoid."" Edit: Although I feel that the observation that the ellipsoid reflects the variance of the  Gaussian distribution that has maximal likelihood to produce $P$ (I haven't rolled up my sleeves and checked), this is not the kind of answer I am looking for. Perhaps I should remove all tags that refer to probability or regression. I will make the question very specific then. From stuff I've seen elsewhere on the web, I get the feeling that this ellipsoid is different from the one that minimizes the sum of squared distances to the points, but I don't know for sure. How about this then: the radial distance from a point $p$ to the ellipsoid is the distance as measured along the line that contains $p$ and $\mu$ (the latter being the origin in our new coordinate system).

We wish to place translated copies of this annulus down so that they cover the plane; obviously, this will cover some points multiple times, since the rings do not tile the plane without overlap. How can we do this to minimize the overall density, i.e., the number of times an average point is covered? I can obtain a density of $\pi$ with the following construction (overlapping rings shown in darker shades): However, it turns out this is suboptimal; we can do better by only placing $2/\epsilon$ of these rings in a line, and covering the plane with the resulting shapes: This uses $2/\epsilon$ rings of area $2\pi\epsilon$ each, for a total area of $4\pi$ , per $2\times 3$ rectangle in the tiling, so its density is $\frac{2\pi}3 \approx 2.094$ . We can improve this further by overlapping the above shapes vertically (as before, each of these is formed from $2/\epsilon$ rings): A bit of calculus tells us this construction is optimized when the vertical overlap between two of the red regions is $2-\sqrt{\frac{3\sqrt{17}-5}2}$ , for a total density of $$\frac{\pi\sqrt{51\sqrt{17}-107}}{16}\approx 1.99954$$ Is this optimal?

Prove $DH \perp AM$. My idea is to prove that $AC'EHB'$ (or $C'BME$ or $B'EMC$) is cyclic. I tried lots of things, but I think the main thing I lacked in all my deductions if usage of $M$ being a mid-point. Other idea is to prove that $H$ is orthocenter of $\triangle AMD$, since we already have $AH\perp MD$, it's enough to prove $MH\perp AD$. If $MH\cap AD=\{G\}$, then we should prove that $G$ lies on circle around $AC'(E)HB'$. So another idea would be to prove that some of triangles ""composed"" of $A,C',E,H,B',G$ with at least once vertices being $E$ or $G$ has circumradius $AH/2$. Some trigonometry? Another idea would be to mark $E'$ as foot of height from $D$ to $AM$ and then use Menelaus theorem to prove that $A-H-E'$, that is, $E\equiv E'$. EDIT. The only place where I think I can use the fact that $M$ is midpoint of $BC$ is that $BM=C'M=B'M=CM$, so there are some equal angles. It should help us prove $E$ lies on circumcircle of $\triangle C'BM$, that is, $C'BME$ is cyclic, because we have $\angle MC'B=MBC'$. It's also interesting to notice that once we prove $E$ lies on mentioned circle, we'd conclude that $DE$ is bisector of $\angle C'EB$, which might be a clue but I still can't figure anything out. EDIT 2. I also thought about using the fact that $\triangle CMA$ and $\triangle BMA$ have same areas. Then we have $AC\sin\alpha_1=BC\sin\alpha_2$ where $\alpha_1=\angle CAM=\angle CAE$ and $\alpha_2=\angle BAM=\angle BAE$, so we might be able to use that somehow for the idea about circumradius being $AH/2$, because we can use sine laws on triangles $\triangle AC'E$ and $AEB'$ (we need to prove $\angle C'EA=\angle B=\beta$ and/or $\angle B'EA=\angle C=\gamma$), from which we might reduce this to proof about similarity of some triangles.

Let's call a real number $\alpha$ an algebraic angle if $\alpha\in[0,2\pi)$ and $\cos \alpha$ is an algebraic number. The set of algebraic angles has some pretty neat properties: The sine, cosine, and tangent of an algebraic angle are algebraic. Define negation and addition of angles the usual way, wrapping around at $2\pi$. Then algebraic angles are closed under negation and addition (since $\cos(\alpha+\beta)=\cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta$). Define multiplication of an algebraic angle by a rational number to also wrap around at $2\pi$. Multiplying an algebraic angle by a rational yields another algebraic angle! This can be proved from the identity $\cos(n\alpha)=T_n(\cos\alpha)$, which I learned about here . $T_n$ is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind . In particular, it is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Since $\pi$ is an algebraic angle, so is any rational multiple of $\pi$ in $[0,2\pi)$. Algebraic angles are a vector space over the rationals (I haven't proved anything interesting using this fact though). They're not a vector space because $x(y\alpha)$ is not necessarily equal to $(xy)\alpha$. For example, $(1/2)(2\cdot\pi)$ is $0$ but $(1/2\cdot 2)\pi$ is $\pi$. Has the set of algebraic angles appeared in academic literature? Individual algebraic angles come up everywhere in geometry: for example, the interior angle between two faces of a regular dodecahedron is $\arccos(-\frac{1}{5}\sqrt{5})$. Let me elaborate on why an algebraic angle divided by an integer yields an algebraic angle: Suppose that $\cos\alpha$ is algebraic, so that there is some polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that $P(\cos\alpha)=0$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. By the Chebyshev identity above, $P(T_n(\cos(\alpha/n)))=0$, so $\cos(\alpha/n)$ is algebraic. Edited 2017-01-10: Ok, after reading some of the answers and comments I realized that the interesting properties of algebraic angles become obvious if you consider how they transform under $\alpha\mapsto e^{i\alpha}$. The algebraic angles become algebraic points on the unit circle, angle negation becomes complex conjugation, angle addition becomes complex multiplication, and multiplying by a rational essentially becomes raising to a rational power. It's clear that algebraicity is preserved by each of these operations.","I'm writing a geometric software library and I came up with a useful concept.

This can be proved from the identity $\cos(n\alpha)=T_n(\cos\alpha)$, which I learned about here . $T_n$ is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind . In particular, it is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Since $\pi$ is an algebraic angle, so is any rational multiple of $\pi$ in $[0,2\pi)$. Algebraic angles are a vector space over the rationals (I haven't proved anything interesting using this fact though). They're not a vector space because $x(y\alpha)$ is not necessarily equal to $(xy)\alpha$. For example, $(1/2)(2\cdot\pi)$ is $0$ but $(1/2\cdot 2)\pi$ is $\pi$. Has the set of algebraic angles appeared in academic literature? Individual algebraic angles come up everywhere in geometry: for example, the interior angle between two faces of a regular dodecahedron is $\arccos(-\frac{1}{5}\sqrt{5})$. Let me elaborate on why an algebraic angle divided by an integer yields an algebraic angle: Suppose that $\cos\alpha$ is algebraic, so that there is some polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that $P(\cos\alpha)=0$. Let $n$ be a positive integer. By the Chebyshev identity above, $P(T_n(\cos(\alpha/n)))=0$, so $\cos(\alpha/n)$ is algebraic. Edited 2017-01-10: Ok, after reading some of the answers and comments I realized that the interesting properties of algebraic angles become obvious if you consider how they transform under $\alpha\mapsto e^{i\alpha}$. The algebraic angles become algebraic points on the unit circle, angle negation becomes complex conjugation, angle addition becomes complex multiplication, and multiplying by a rational essentially becomes raising to a rational power. It's clear that algebraicity is preserved by each of these operations.",,"['geometry', 'reference-request', 'angle']"

80,Cross Product Intuition,Cross Product Intuition,,"I know the cross product between a vector $a$ and a vector $b$ is just a vector whose magnitude is the product of magnitude of $b$ times the magnitude of the perpendicular component of $a$ in relation to $b$.This arises in many applications like in calculating the torque and the magnetic force. The magnitude of this vectors definies how perpendicular $a$ and $b$ are ... The more perpendicular, the higher the magnitude.This fact implies that, in order for it to be a measure of perpendicularity, we need the magnitude of $a \times b$ to be $\lvert a \rvert \lvert b \rvert \sin(\theta)$ and that should be a no-brainer. It turns out that measuring the ""perpendicularity"" is the same as measuring the area between the paralelogram formed by the two vectors, the more perpendicularity, higher the area that is formed. Concluding, I fully understand the reasoning between why the magnitude of the cross product is the way it is. But i want to keep building my intuition on Cross Product and I'm kinda stuck with two problems: 1- What is the reason (other than the fact that the magnetic force is vector perpendicular to both $v$ and $b$, and that the normal vector to a plane is a vector perpendicular to two vectors in the plane, for example) that this measure of perpendicularity ($\lvert a \rvert \lvert b \rvert \sin(\theta)$) was attributed to the magnitude of a vector? Why wasn't the cross product defined as just this magnitude? Was the orthogonal vector just some convenient form of killing two birds with a stone (getting both the measure of perpendicularity and getting the normal vector to the plane spanned by $a$ and $b$)? 2 - Is there any intuition that the components of cross product $a \times b$ are: $ \langle(a_y b_z - a_z b_y), (a_z b_x - a_x b_z), (a_x b_y - a_y b_x) \rangle$?

While true when $n=1,2,3$ , it fails in dimension $64$ and higher; I believe all other $n$ are open as of this writing. However, it turns out that at least in the $n=2$ case we can be more precise than ""strictly smaller diameter""; if the original set has diameter 1, we can ensure that each piece has diameter at most $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\approx 0.866$ , a bound attained by the circle of diameter $1$ . To see that this holds, we note that the regular hexagon of width $1$ is a solution to Lebesgue's universal covering problem , and can be split into three sets of diameter $\frac{\sqrt{3}}2$ as well: I am interested in putting bounds on such dissections with more than $3$ pieces: what is the minimum diameter one can ensure when cutting a planar set of unit diameter into $k$ pieces? Using the same approach as above (finding specific sets with a lower bound, and dissecting a universal cover for sets of diameter 1), I have some bounds for higher $k$ as well, though only for $k=3,4,7$ are they exact: (Extending this table beyond $k=7$ would be difficult, as working out optimal dissections for the circle would become much more complicated.) Edit: By taking spokes at $72^\circ$ angles on a regular hexagon (with one spoke meeting the hexagon at the midpoint of a side), I think I can get a slightly better upper bound of around $0.6434$ for the case $k=5$ . Optimizing spoke placement further (so that the distances between spoke endpoints are equal) gets me around $0.6223$ . In the limit, I think the diameter of each piece is asymptotic to $\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{3\sqrt{3}k}}\approx \frac{1.1}{\sqrt{k}}$ by tiling with regular hexagons. Certainly one can do no better than $1/\sqrt{k}$ when dividing the circle, using the isodiametric inequality (if the pieces were any smaller, they would have too little area).

93,Best way to cut a pineapple ring?,Best way to cut a pineapple ring?,,"I like to prepare pineapples by first cutting it into rounds and then slicing off the skin with a roast beef slicer. This leaves me with a hexagon ""ring"" around a circular core: I then don't want to dirty another knife to core it, so I just reuse the beef slicer. But it's too big for precise cuts, so I have to cut all the way across the ring. Normally a cut a small square around the core, like this: The problem is this leaves me with unequal pieces— the first piece is much bigger and the fourth piece is much smaller. How can I make N cuts, each across the entire remaining core, so that I'm left with a set of pieces that are as close in area to each other as possible? I don't care about them having the same shape , just that they have the same area. N doesn't have to be 4, though I'd really prefer to keep it under 6 or so. Some waste around the core is ok.","I like to prepare pineapples by first cutting it into rounds and then slicing off the skin with a roast beef slicer.

94,Find the angles of given triangle ABC,Find the angles of given triangle ABC,,"A triangle $ABC$ with angle bisectors $AA_1$ and $BB_1$ is given, such that $\angle AA_1B_1 = 24^\circ$ and $\angle BB_1A_1 = 18^\circ$ . Find the angles of the triangle. I've been stuck on this one for quite a long time. After denoting with $I$ the incenter of ABC and deriving that $\angle C = 96^\circ$ from $\angle AIB = 90^\circ + \frac12\angle C = 138^\circ$ , I really don't know how to continue. I tried using Geogebra to see everything clearer or at least guess the answer, and I concluded that $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ should be $12^\circ$ and $72^\circ$ respectively, but I'm not sure how to prove it. Any help would be appreciated. If I come up with something, I will post it right away. Thanks in advance!","A triangle with angle bisectors and is given, such that and .

96,How do I compute the area of a cross which contains several disks which may overlap?,How do I compute the area of a cross which contains several disks which may overlap?,,"I have found this in a Facebook group :) The only thing we are given is the marked distance and we need to find the shaded area. I have tried several options but I am always missing some data. Then I tried the following: I considered two different conditions: The two side circles do not overlap; they are tangent to each other. In this case, the given distance corresponds to 3 diameters, so each is 3.33 units and the requested area is 100 sq. units. The two side circles overlap by 100%. Again the area is 100 sq. units. It is therefore obvious that the area is independent from the amount of overlapping, i.e. from the angle of the specific line segment to the horizontal line. Can you provide a geometrical solution? Many thanks!!","I have found this in a Facebook group :) The only thing we are given is the marked distance and we need to find the shaded area.

98,Constraints on conical coffee cup constructions of cardioids & catacaustics,Constraints on conical coffee cup constructions of cardioids & catacaustics,,"The Mathologer video Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics discusses several relationships. For the n=2 and 3 cases, the cardiod and catacaustic (or nephroid per @Rahul's comment ) curves are shown in reflections in coffee cups. In the case of the cardiod the cup must be conical but presumably not cylindrical, for the catacaustic it must be a cylinder. Question: If I wanted to construct these caustics using Blender , what are the specific constraints on the shapes of the coffee cups and directions of illumination? Can the former be any converging or diverging cone, and does the illumination direction need to have the same angle as that of the cone? Must the later be a perfect cylinder and the illumination only oblique?

99,Dividing a unit square into rectangles,Dividing a unit square into rectangles,,"I've been given this task: A unit square is cut into rectangles. Each of them is coloured by either yellow or blue and inside it a number is written. If the color of the rectangle is blue then its number is equal to rectangle’s width divided by its height. If the color is yellow, the number is rectangle’s height divided by its width. Let $x$ be the sum of the numbers in all rectangles. Assuming the blue area is equal to the yellow one, what is the smallest possible $x$? I've came with the solution below:  I've simply split the unit square in half and assigned the colors. The reasoning behind that is that I want to have the blue side as high as possible (to make the $x$ as low as possible) and the yellow side as wide as possible (for the same reason). I didn't divide the square into rectangles with infinitely small height or width, because no matter how small they are, they eventually add up and form the two big rectangles that are on my picture. I feel my solution is wrong though, because it is stupidly easy (you have to admit, that often means it's wrong).
