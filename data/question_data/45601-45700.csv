1,Cyclic subgroups and generators,Cyclic subgroups and generators,,"Sorry for posting a second question on this topic, abstract algebra is taking a bit longer to get my head around. I'm trying to work out if this is cyclic or not, and find all generators or show no generator exists. $\langle(12)(34)(56),(145)(236)\rangle \leq S_6$ Just in case there's differences in notation, that's just the subgroup generated by the elements $(12)(13)(56)$ and $(145)(236)$ of $S_6$. The problem is, my notes only show one example like this, but both permutations were even, and it was in $S_4$ so they just showed that you could generate $A_4$ (by literally showing you could make every even permutation) using the two elements. Given how one of the elements here is odd, and we're dealing with $S_6$ it doesn't look like a good method. So far, I've noted that, letting $\sigma = (12)(34)(56)$ and $\tau = (145)(236)$ we get that $o(\sigma) = 2$ and $o(\tau) = 3$ Also, that $\sigma \tau = (135246) = \tau \sigma$, $(\sigma \tau)^2 = (\tau \sigma)^2 = (154)(326) = \tau^{-1}$ Lastly that $(\sigma \tau)^3 = (\tau \sigma)^3 = (12)(34)(56) = \sigma = \sigma^{-1}$ I get a bit stuck as to where to go at this point, although I can't see how it's even possible this is cyclic.

10,Need for axiom of choice?,Need for axiom of choice?,,"When you invoke the axiom of choice, it is because whatever you need to choose consists of small parts you technically have to choose one by one. So if I need to use the axiom of choice, but subsequently prove that no matter what I choose the end result is the same, is there really a need for the axiom of choice? This is where I bumped into the question: You have a set of abelian groups $G_i$ each with a given subgroup $H_i$, with $i\in I$ for some index set $I$. Show that the following isomorphism holds: $$ \prod_{i\in I}\left(G_i/H_i\right) \approx\left(\prod_{i\in I}G_i\right)/\left(\prod_{i\in I}H_i\right). $$ And here's my proof: An element in $g\in \prod_{i\in I}\left(G_i/H_i\right)$ is given by a (possibly infinite) tuple of elements of each quotient group. Each coordinate in the tuple is represented by an element $g_i$ in the corresponding $G_i$, which means that we can use the representatives to make an element in $\prod_{i\in I}G_i$ (this requires the axiom of choice if $I$ is big enough). Now, the difference between any two such elements is a tuple in $\prod_{i\in I}H_i$, so in the end what choice we make doesn't matter, any choice will give the same element in the final quotient group. But I still used the axiom to show that a representative existed, so my intuition says that this needs the axiom of choice, although I'm not certain. I use the word ""tuple"" here, because that's how I think of direct products. Representing the product as a function from the index set into the disjoint union (which is the proper way) will give a completely analogous reasoning.","When you invoke the axiom of choice, it is because whatever you need to choose consists of small parts you technically have to choose one by one.

I attempted to prove it categorically and am wondering if the following justification is correct. Define the covariant functor $\text{Ab}:\text{Grp}\to \text{AbGrp}$ by sending objects $G\in \text{Ob}(\text{Grp})$ to $G/[G,G]\in \text{Ob}(\text{Ab})$ and morphisms $f \in \text{Hom}(G,H)$ to $f' \in \text{Hom}(\text{Ab}(G),\text{Ab}(H))$ by $f'([g]_G)=[f(g)]_H$ . The well-definedness of $f'$ can be easily checked. Since the free product is the coproduct in the category $\text{Grp}$ , it follows that for all groups $H$ and morphisms $f_\alpha:G_\alpha\to H$ , there exists a unique $f:\mathop{\Large *}_\alpha G_\alpha\to H$ such that $f \circ \iota_\alpha=f_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$ . Now, suppose $H$ is abelian. Then, Ab $(H)\simeq H$ . Now, take a family of morphisms $\{g_\alpha:\text{Ab}(G_\alpha)\to H\}$ , and define $f_\alpha:G_\alpha \to H$ by $f_\alpha(k)=g_\alpha([k]_G)$ for all $k \in G_\alpha$ .

This description characterises them up to isomorphism. Question: is there a similar way to define the field of complex numbers? In contrast to the difficulty of constructing $\mathbb R$ from $\mathbb Q$ , the construction of $\mathbb C$ from $\mathbb R$ is straightforward. For instance, $\mathbb C$ may be defined as $\mathbb R^2$ with the operations $(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+b,c+d)$ and $(a,b)\cdot(c,d)=(ac-bd,ad+bc)$ . Then, $i$ can be defined as $(0,1)$ , and we may identify $\mathbb R$ with the subfield $\{(a,0):a\in\mathbb R\}$ . Any model of $\mathbb C$ is isomorphic to this model. However, it feels somewhat artificial to describe a model of $\mathbb C$ as a field $F$ which is isomorphic to $\mathbb R^2$ with the aforementioned operations; it would be like describing a model of $\mathbb R$ as a field which is isomorphic to the collection of Dedekind cuts.

90,Is there a standard way to find the subfields of $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ when $n$ is not prime?,Is there a standard way to find the subfields of  when  is not prime?,\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_n) n,"For $n$ prime, there seem to be standard ways of determining the subfields. This question gives such a method. However, this method does not necessarily work for $n$ not prime, and the method that I have employed seems very ad hoc. Essentially, my method has just been to determine the Galois group and find its subgroups, look to see if any roots are fixed or cycle through each other, and then trying adding or multiplying those roots and checking if the minimal polynomials are the same as the degree of the extensions. An Example For example, consider $\zeta = \zeta_{18}$ . I know that $\Phi_{18} = x^6-x^3+1$ , so $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)$ is of degree $6$ over $\Bbb{Q}$ . Further, if we let $\sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^5$ , we can completely classify the Galois group of $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)$ : $$\operatorname{Gal}(\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)/\Bbb{Q})= \{e,\sigma, \sigma^2,\sigma^3,\sigma^4,\sigma^5\} \simeq \Bbb{Z}_6.$$ Then I know that by the fundamental theorem, there should be subfields corresponding to each of the following subgroups: \begin{align*} H_1 &= \{e\}, \\ H_2 &= \langle \sigma_3 \rangle = \{e,\sigma^3\}, \\ H_3 &= \langle \sigma^2\rangle = \{e,\sigma^2, \sigma^4\},\\ H_4 &= \operatorname{Gal}(\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)/\Bbb{Q}). \end{align*} So obviously the fixed field of $H_1$ is $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)$ and the fixed field of $H_4$ is $\Bbb{Q}$ , so I just need to figure out the fixed fields of $H_2$ and $H_3$ . So I noticed that $\sigma^3$ takes $\zeta \mapsto \zeta^{-1} \mapsto \zeta$ , $\zeta^5\mapsto \zeta^{-5} \mapsto \zeta^5$ , and $\zeta^7\mapsto \zeta^{-7} \mapsto \zeta^7$ , so clearly $H_2$ fixes $\zeta+\zeta^{-1}$ , $\zeta^5+\zeta^{-5}$ , and $\zeta^7+\zeta^{-7}$ . Here's where I encounter my first question. By looking on Wolfram I know that each of these values have the same minimal polynomial, namely $x^3-3x-1$ , and this is the correct degree for the extension we are looking for. Does this then mean that the fixed field MUST be $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta + \zeta^{-1})$ ? (Side question: to figure out the above, I relied on Wolfram to tell me the minimal polynomial. Is there a way of figuring out the minimal polynomial of such ugly numbers by hand?) If we now consider $H_3$ , I noticed that both $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma^4$ cycle $\zeta, \zeta^7,\zeta^{-5}$ to each other, and they cycle $\zeta^{-1},\zeta^5,\zeta^{-7}$ to each other. So my first guess was that the fixed field must be $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta+\zeta^7+\zeta^{-5})$ , but checking Wolfram tells me that $\zeta+\zeta^7+\zeta^{-5} = 0,$ so clearly this doesn't work. (Side question: is there a way I would have been able to tell this was equal to $0$ without using Wolfram?) So I then guessed that maybe it was $\zeta\zeta^7\zeta^{-5} = e^{\frac{\pi i}{3}}$ . This has a minimal polynomial of degree 2, which matches the degree we want for the extension over $\Bbb{Q}$ . So again, does this mean that this is the extension we want? Summary Clearly the method I have employed to solve this type of problem is quite ad hoc. So is there a better way of determining the subfields of such an extension other than using the correspondence and just kind of guessing and checking?","For prime, there seem to be standard ways of determining the subfields.

Further, if we let , we can completely classify the Galois group of : Then I know that by the fundamental theorem, there should be subfields corresponding to each of the following subgroups: So obviously the fixed field of is and the fixed field of is , so I just need to figure out the fixed fields of and . So I noticed that takes , , and , so clearly fixes , , and . Here's where I encounter my first question. By looking on Wolfram I know that each of these values have the same minimal polynomial, namely , and this is the correct degree for the extension we are looking for. Does this then mean that the fixed field MUST be ? (Side question: to figure out the above, I relied on Wolfram to tell me the minimal polynomial. Is there a way of figuring out the minimal polynomial of such ugly numbers by hand?) If we now consider , I noticed that both and cycle to each other, and they cycle to each other. So my first guess was that the fixed field must be , but checking Wolfram tells me that so clearly this doesn't work. (Side question: is there a way I would have been able to tell this was equal to without using Wolfram?) So I then guessed that maybe it was . This has a minimal polynomial of degree 2, which matches the degree we want for the extension over . So again, does this mean that this is the extension we want? Summary Clearly the method I have employed to solve this type of problem is quite ad hoc. So is there a better way of determining the subfields of such an extension other than using the correspondence and just kind of guessing and checking?","n n \zeta = \zeta_{18} \Phi_{18} = x^6-x^3+1 \Bbb{Q}(\zeta) 6 \Bbb{Q} \sigma(\zeta) = \zeta^5 \Bbb{Q}(\zeta) \operatorname{Gal}(\Bbb{Q}(\zeta)/\Bbb{Q})= \{e,\sigma, \sigma^2,\sigma^3,\sigma^4,\sigma^5\} \simeq \Bbb{Z}_6. \begin{align*}

We know that $\sigma = \sigma_1...\sigma_k$, where the $\sigma_i$'s are disjoint cycles of some length. We want to maximize $|\sigma| = lcm(|\sigma_1|,...,|\sigma_k|)$, where $|\sigma_i|$ is the order of the permutation $\sigma_i$, which is just its length since it is a cycle. If any of the lengths are the same, then the lcm will be the same, so we may take each $\sigma_i$ to have a different length in our attempt to maximize $|\sigma|$. This leaves us with four different lengths (I am excluding $1$). Thus $\sigma = \sigma_1 ... \sigma_4$; however, as we shall see, it is not possible for $\sigma$ to be a product of 4 disjoint cycles if we are maximizing their lengths. If $\sigma_1$ is a 5-cycle, then none of the 5 numbers will appear in any of the other cycles, and so $\sigma = \sigma_1$ which implies $|\sigma| = 5$. If $\sigma_1$ is a 4-cycle, then 4 of the 5 numbers appear in it, leaving only number left $\sigma_1$ and none to ther others.
