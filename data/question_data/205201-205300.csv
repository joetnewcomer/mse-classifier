I spoke of big O notation because I didn’t know if it was possible to solve in a non-algorithmic manner. The responses I’ve got have been amazing and incredibly detailed. A big thank you to everyone for perpetuating such a helpful community!","I could use help modeling this puzzle. I'm not looking for a solution but I need help in phrasing the problem mathematically. I need a change in paradigm. My friend asked me for help with this puzzle but frankly, I'm not sure where to begin. I'm thinking maybe of a discrete math or maybe even a linear algebra approach but I've not taken either class in many years and am not sure. I tried discrete math but the expressions I got were too long to be reasonable. Linear algebra struck me only because it's matrix-based but I couldn't find a way to apply it (with further thought seems very much the wrong tool). Is there a way to set the problem up so that it can be solved in time? I am looking up Sudoku algorithms at the moment and hopefully that'll help. Any suggestions to a posable algorithm or model would be great! Edit: I know I used a lot of buzz words in my original post. These edits should have fixed some of that. I don’t like the name of the puzzle either but I wanted to be somewhat academic in adding a source. To clarify for @Blitzer I just what to know what type of math to use.
