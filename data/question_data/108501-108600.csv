0,Algebra in Geometric Proof of Quadratic Reciprocity,Algebra in Geometric Proof of Quadratic Reciprocity,,"I am trying to understand the proof of quadratic reciprocity form the George Andrews textbook on number theory (this proof follows geometry and Eisenstein's thinking). I understand what is happening conceptually, but the finer points of inequality algebra are not obvious to me. We are given sets $\mu_1=\{q,2q,\cdots,\frac{1}{2}(p-1)q\}$ and $\mu_2=\{p,2p,\cdots,\frac{1}{2}(q-1)p\}$ , with $\mu_1$ representing the negative least residues mod $p$ and $\mu_2$ representing the negative least residues mod $q$ . Ultimately the proof shows $\mu_1+\mu_2$ is odd if and only if $p\equiv q\equiv3\pmod{4}$ . The author illustrates this by considering a hexagon $H$ with vertices $ABCDEF$ that lies within a rectangle $AGDJ$ (drawn in Quadrant $I$ ) that is bounded by $x=p/2$ and $y=q/2$ . The attached picture provides additional information about the components of the rectangle. For a point $(x,y)$ to lie in $H$ , it must satisfy, $0<x<p/2$ , $0<y<q/2$ , $y<\frac{q}{p}x+\frac{1}{2}$ , and $y>\frac{q}{p}x-\frac{q}{2p}$ . The next step remarks that if $(m,n)$ is some lattice point in $H$ , then so is $(\frac{p+1}{2}-m,\frac{q+1}{2}-n)$ , where these two points are $equal$ . This is verified by substituting ""these coordinates"" into the four inequalities above. I'm not sure what is meant by ""these coordinates."" I assumed it meant $(m,n)$ , so this is what I tried. $\frac{q}{p}x-\frac{q}{2p}<y<\frac{q}{p}x+\frac{1}{2}\Rightarrow \frac{q}{p}m-\frac{q}{2p}<n<\frac{q}{p}m+\frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow qm-\frac{q}{2}<py<qm+\frac{p}{2}$ $\Rightarrow 2qm-q<2py<2qx+p$ .

And so, using the condition of tangency, $$a^2= m^2(r_1)^2+(r_1)^2= 4+1 $$ And thus, as $a$ can only be negative (otherwise a positive value of $a$ will make the line intersect the circle).

Split the dome into equal horizontal rings, and note that each ring shades the 'ground' using some percentage of it's surface.  For the ring at the top of the dome, the shadow will be 100% of the surface of the ring, whereas for the ring at the ground the shadow will be 0% of the surface, since the ring is edge-on to the light. Since the dome is completely symmetrical we can take the 'average' shadow factor as 50%. Therefore the surface area of the dome is twice the area of the great circle, and the full sphere is 4 times.

I am currently trying to figure out how to define the osculating circle at a point $c(t_0)$ , $t_0 \in I$ , without assuming that the curvature has previously been defined (which could for example be done via the Frenet frame). One way to define it might be the following way using a limit: Assume that locally around the point $c(t_0)$ the curve is not a straight line. Consider a value $h>0$ with $t_0 \pm h \in I$ such that the three points $c(t_0-h)$ , $c(t_0)$ and $c(t_0+h)$ are not located on a straight line. Let $M(t_0,h)$ be the center of the circle defined by those three points. The osculating circle at $c(t_0)$ might then be defined as being the circle with center $M$ and radius $r$ where these values are given by $$M:=\lim_{h \to 0} M(t_0,h)\phantom{aaa}\text{and}\phantom{aaa}r:=\Vert M-c(t_0) \Vert$$ The limit runs only over those values of $h$ for which the three points $c(t_0-h)$ , $c(t_0)$ and $c(t_0+h)$ are not located on a straight line.

Some background: A similar definition for the osculating circle is indicated in the book ""Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica"" by Gray et al. in section 4.4. However, they do not explain why the limit should exist or least I do not understand this. Addendum : Finally, I learned that there must be a ""mistake"" in the definition. Since this is not mentioned in any of the answers, I decided to explain it here: The condition that $c$ is not a straight line locally around $c(t_0)$ is not sufficient for the osculating circle to exist. Under this condition, it may still happen that for every sufficiently small $h>0$ , you can find a straight line through the points $c(t_0-h)$ , $c(t_0)$ and $c(t_0+h)$ . Take for example $c(t)=(t,t^3)$ , $-1/2 < t < 1/2$ and $t_0=0$ . Therefore: No osculating circle at $c(t_0)$ in that case. The points $M(t_0,h)$ are not well-defined because they don't exist.

45,Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?,Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?,,"Lately I have been thinking about commutator formulas, sparked by rereading the following paragraph in Isaacs (p.125): An amazing commutator formula is the Hall-Witt identity: $$[x,y^{-1},z]^y[y,z^{-1},x]^z[z,x^{-1},y]^x=1,$$ which holds for any three elements of every group.  $\ldots$  One can think of the Hall-Witt formula as a kind of three-variable version of the much more elementary two-variable identity, $[x,y][y,x]=1$.  This observation hints at the possibility that a corresponding four-variable formula might exist, but if there is such a four-variable identity, it has yet to be discovered. To my knowledge a four-variable formula hasn't been discovered since this was written.  I was thinking about this and found myself unable to even decide whether or not I thought one could exist (i.e. whether one would, hypothetically, try to find an identity or disprove its existence).  Thus, I am attempting to ""write down the problem."" How can one rigorously formulate the question, ""Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?"" Let's start by explicitly making the free group on $4$ letters.  Suppose we have a free generating set $A=\{a,b,c,d\}$, so that $S=A\cup A^{-1}$ and $A^{-1}=\{a^{-1},b^{-1},c^{-1},d^{-1}\}$.  Let $F_A$ the group of all reduced words in $S$.  Words are reduced when they have been can no longer be simplified by cancelling adjacent $x$ and $x^{-1}$s (for $x\in A$). Cyclically reduced words are words where the first and last letters are not inverse to each other.  Every word is conjugate to a cyclically reduced word, so we can consider $\hat{F_A}$, the quotient of $F_A$ by the equivalence relation of being cyclically reduced.  (Note that this is not the equivalence relation of being conjugate.) Let $\Phi$ be the set of functions $\varphi:A^4\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ defining words in $\hat{F_A}$ that contain at least one instance of each free generator or its inverse.  Now let $\Psi:\Phi\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ be formally defined by $$\Psi(\varphi)(u,x,y,z)=\varphi(u,x,y,z)\varphi(x,y,z,u)\varphi(y,z,u,x)\varphi(z,u,x,y).$$ So, if a $4$-variable Hall-Witt identity exists, it will be among the functions in the preimage of $0$ (the function which just maps everything to the empty word) under $\Psi$. Question: Assuming the above formulation is sound, does there exist a (nontrivial) four-variable analog to the Hall-Witt identity?  Can this approach be used to further refine the question? My use of ""nontrivial"" above is somewhat ambiguous: what I mean is that the identity should be made with commutators and conjugations in a free set of four letters, and done so in a way that it does not reduce to the two- or three-variable commutator identities by a substitution. Progress. Let $$\begin{eqnarray*} W(a,b,c) & \triangleq & [a,b^{-1},c]^b \\  &=& b^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]^{-1}c^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]cb\\ &=&a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1}bab^{-1}cb.\end{eqnarray*}$$ Let's chop $W(a,b,c)$ in half and name the two parts.  Define $$w_1(a,b,c)\triangleq a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1} \hspace{30pt} \text{and} \hspace{30pt} w_2(a,b,c)\triangleq bab^{-1}cb,$$ so that $$W(a,b,c)=w_1(a,b,c)w_2(a,b,c).$$  Now, the Hall-Witt Identity can be written as $$W(x,y,z)W(y,z,x)W(z,x,y)=1,$$ that is, $$\overbrace{\underbrace{x^{-1}y^{-1}xz^{-1}x^{-1}}_{w_1(x,y,z)}\underbrace{yxy^{-1}zy}_{w_2(x,y,z)}}^{W(x,y,z)} \overbrace{\underbrace{y^{-1}z^{-1}yx^{-1}y^{-1}}_{w_1(y,z,x)}\underbrace{zyz^{-1}xz}_{w_2(y,z,x)}}^{W(y,z,x)}  \overbrace{\underbrace{z^{-1}x^{-1}zy^{-1}z^{-1}}_{w_1(z,x,y)}\underbrace{xzx^{-1}yx}_{w_2(z,x,y)}}^{W(z,x,y)} =1.$$ It's clear the cancellation works by $w_1(b,c,a)=w_2(a,b,c)^{-1}$.  This makes sense: we should be able to cyclically permute the overall word and have it still work, since $1^a=1$.  So, what we should be looking for are four letter strings $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that $w_1(a,b,c,d)$ is the inverse of $w_2(b,c,d,a)$. Update : In fact, the above observation is not just sufficient, but necessary for the existence of a four-variable Hall-Witt identity.   Consider for example the case where $W(a,b,c,d)$ would be split into three subwords, rather than two: $$W(a,b,c,d)=w_1(a,b,c,d)w_2(a,b,c,d)w_3(a,b,c,d).$$  We would in this case have to insist that $$w_3(a,b,c,d)=w_1(b,c,d,a)^{-1}\hspace{14pt}\text{ and }\hspace{14pt}w_2(a,b,c,d)=w_2(b,c,d,a)^{-1}.$$  After the $w_1$'s and $w_3$'s cancelled out, we'd be left with $$w_2(x,y,z,u)w_2(y,z,u,x)w_2(z,u,x,y)w_2(u,x,y,z)=1.$$ But of course asking whether that that can happen is the same as asking whether $W$ can exist, so eventually we will see a separation into two subwords, or we have a contradiction by infinite descent.  If we divided up $W(a,b,c,d)$ into $n>3$ subwords, we would reduce in the case of odd $n$ to the case of a self-inverse word analogously to the $n=3$ case, or we would have an even number of subwords, which is the same thing as the $2$ subword case. So, it suffices to either find a word $W(a,b,c,d)=w_1(a,b,c,d)w_2(a,b,c,d)$, nontrivial in each variable, such that $w_1(a,b,c,d)=w_2(b,c,d,a)^{-1}$, or to prove that such a word does not exist.","Lately I have been thinking about commutator formulas, sparked by rereading the following paragraph in Isaacs (p.125): An amazing commutator formula is the Hall-Witt identity: $$[x,y^{-1},z]^y[y,z^{-1},x]^z[z,x^{-1},y]^x=1,$$ which holds for any three elements of every group.  $\ldots$  One can think of the Hall-Witt formula as a kind of three-variable version of the much more elementary two-variable identity, $[x,y][y,x]=1$.  This observation hints at the possibility that a corresponding four-variable formula might exist, but if there is such a four-variable identity, it has yet to be discovered. To my knowledge a four-variable formula hasn't been discovered since this was written.  I was thinking about this and found myself unable to even decide whether or not I thought one could exist (i.e. whether one would, hypothetically, try to find an identity or disprove its existence).  Thus, I am attempting to ""write down the problem."" How can one rigorously formulate the question, ""Does a four-variable analog of the Hall-Witt identity exist?"" Let's start by explicitly making the free group on $4$ letters.  Suppose we have a free generating set $A=\{a,b,c,d\}$, so that $S=A\cup A^{-1}$ and $A^{-1}=\{a^{-1},b^{-1},c^{-1},d^{-1}\}$.  Let $F_A$ the group of all reduced words in $S$.  Words are reduced when they have been can no longer be simplified by cancelling adjacent $x$ and $x^{-1}$s (for $x\in A$). Cyclically reduced words are words where the first and last letters are not inverse to each other.  Every word is conjugate to a cyclically reduced word, so we can consider $\hat{F_A}$, the quotient of $F_A$ by the equivalence relation of being cyclically reduced.  (Note that this is not the equivalence relation of being conjugate.) Let $\Phi$ be the set of functions $\varphi:A^4\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ defining words in $\hat{F_A}$ that contain at least one instance of each free generator or its inverse.  Now let $\Psi:\Phi\rightarrow \hat{F_A}$ be formally defined by $$\Psi(\varphi)(u,x,y,z)=\varphi(u,x,y,z)\varphi(x,y,z,u)\varphi(y,z,u,x)\varphi(z,u,x,y).$$ So, if a $4$-variable Hall-Witt identity exists, it will be among the functions in the preimage of $0$ (the function which just maps everything to the empty word) under $\Psi$. Question: Assuming the above formulation is sound, does there exist a (nontrivial) four-variable analog to the Hall-Witt identity?  Can this approach be used to further refine the question? My use of ""nontrivial"" above is somewhat ambiguous: what I mean is that the identity should be made with commutators and conjugations in a free set of four letters, and done so in a way that it does not reduce to the two- or three-variable commutator identities by a substitution. Progress. Let $$\begin{eqnarray*} W(a,b,c) & \triangleq & [a,b^{-1},c]^b \\  &=& b^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]^{-1}c^{-1}[a,b^{-1}]cb\\ &=&a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1}bab^{-1}cb.\end{eqnarray*}$$ Let's chop $W(a,b,c)$ in half and name the two parts.  Define $$w_1(a,b,c)\triangleq a^{-1}b^{-1}ac^{-1}a^{-1} \hspace{30pt} \text{and} \hspace{30pt} w_2(a,b,c)\triangleq bab^{-1}cb,$$ so that $$W(a,b,c)=w_1(a,b,c)w_2(a,b,c).$$  Now, the Hall-Witt Identity can be written as $$W(x,y,z)W(y,z,x)W(z,x,y)=1,$$ that is, $$\overbrace{\underbrace{x^{-1}y^{-1}xz^{-1}x^{-1}}_{w_1(x,y,z)}\underbrace{yxy^{-1}zy}_{w_2(x,y,z)}}^{W(x,y,z)} \overbrace{\underbrace{y^{-1}z^{-1}yx^{-1}y^{-1}}_{w_1(y,z,x)}\underbrace{zyz^{-1}xz}_{w_2(y,z,x)}}^{W(y,z,x)}  \overbrace{\underbrace{z^{-1}x^{-1}zy^{-1}z^{-1}}_{w_1(z,x,y)}\underbrace{xzx^{-1}yx}_{w_2(z,x,y)}}^{W(z,x,y)} =1.$$ It's clear the cancellation works by $w_1(b,c,a)=w_2(a,b,c)^{-1}$.

The question is motivated by an answer I gave to this question . I also asked a related question on MO , although hopefully this question should be easier. There exists a rather remarkable relationship between the 5 platonic solids, and the factor groups of the $n$-string braid groups $B_n$ by adjoining the relation $\sigma_i^k=1$ (here the $\sigma_i$, $1\leq i\leq n-1$ are the usual generators of $B_n$). We'll call these groups $B_n(k)$ the truncated braid groups of type $(n,k)$ where $B_n(k)=B_n/\langle \sigma_i^k\rangle$. Theorem *: For $n\geq 3$, the group $B_n(k)$ is finite if and only if $k=2$ or $(n,k)$ is the Schläfli type of one of the 5 platonic solids. For these cases, $$|B_n(k)|=\left(\frac{f(n,k)}{2}\right)^{n-1}n!$$ where $f(n,k)$ is the number of faces of the platonic solid of type $(n,k).$ The 5 platonic solids correspond to the pairs $(n,k)\in\{(3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3)\}$.

My question is: Question Can one view the finite truncated braid groups in a geometric way as some action (in the vague, not necessarily strict group-action, sense) on the corresponding platonic solid or related objects? Some of the approaches I have taken have included: considering the isometry group on the corresponding solid (group orders don't match up), considering paths on the surface which 'remember' the side that a face was entered from (relations don't match up), considering labellings of the edges of the faces of the solid so that no face has a pair of edges with the same label, with group elements being permutations of edges which preserve this property (not sure if order matches up - seems difficult to calculate but may be the best approach so far), considering 'rolling' the solid along a surface until it reaches its starting point again (no obvious way of making this a group via some kind of homotopy ) It seems that there should be some nice geometric interpretation of these groups, especially as every face has $n$ edges and every vertex is shared by $k$ faces.

This is not true (a simple example given by $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$, with $H=\langle (1,0)\rangle$ and $K=\langle (0,2)\rangle$). A sufficient condition to guarantee isomorphic quotients is the existence of an automorphism $\varphi\in\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $\varphi(H)=K$.

For example, take again $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$, and take $H=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\langle (0,2)\rangle$, isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group, and $K=\{0\}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$.

Motivation : In some cases, there are so many kinds of orbits of G on Ω that every subgroup of G appears as a point-stabilizer.  However, these actions are quite rare, even in the case of a point group of a group of Euclidean isometries. (The only such actions in 2D are C 1 , D 1 , and C p for primes p .  This follows because rotation subgroups only stabilize the origin.) (example for D4 by Bill Cook) . If we allow the group to act on subsets too, then we may have better luck.  See for instance, the lovely example of dihedral groups and cyclic groups acting naturally on the Euclidean plane as Rosette groups.  Here one can take various natural subsets of the polygon to get all subgroups. In general a finite point group of a group of Euclidean isometries has a regular orbit, and the blocks of that orbit suffice to specify all subgroups (there is a 1-1 correspondence between subgroups containing a point stabilizer and blocks of the orbit given, and this correspondence is given by the set-wise stabilizer).  This is true more generally for small groups acting on large vector spaces (if V is n -dimensional over K and | G |−1 < 1+| K |+…+| K | n −1 , then G has a regular orbit on V in any faithful, linear action of G on V ; in particular finite groups acting on infinite vector spaces are fine). However, determining which medium-ish linear groups over medium-ish vector spaces have regular orbits is really hard, as far as I know.  I wondered if it was much easier if we allowed one to replace V by V ⊕ V .  Certainly we can replace V by V V (taking d =| V |), but that is a bit extreme. Is there some reasonable value of d that can be read from the permutation character of G on Ω , from the (Brauer) character of G on V , or some other natural invariant of the action of G on Ω ? An expression for the minimum would be nice, but even some decent bound on d in terms of invariants would be fine. To identify Galois groups, one also looks for certain invariants for polynomials, and I believe what I am asking is relevant to how complicated such invariants need to be.  GAP for instance takes d ≤ 5, I think (and used to take d ≤ 3, I think), but it has lots of ""backup"" routines to identify various other subgroups, possibly for efficiency, but possibly because one cannot choose d that small in general.","Is there some natural or character-theoretic description of the minimum value of d such that G has a regular orbit on Ω d , where G is a finite group acting faithfully on a set Ω ?

70,Is there a group with exactly 92 elements of order 3?,Is there a group with exactly 92 elements of order 3?,,"The number of elements of order 2 in a group is fairly restricted: 0, odd, or infinity.  All such possibilities occur already in the trivial group and in dihedral groups. The number of elements of order 3 in a group can be shown to be similarly restricted: 0, 2 mod 6, or infinity.  However, something strange happens: not all possibilities can be realized. Even worse, there is a fairly small number that I cannot decide whether it is or is not the number of elements of order 3 in a finite group: Is there a group with exactly 92 elements of order 3? More boldly, I would like to know (but feel free to answer only the first question): Exactly which numbers occur as the number of elements of order 3 in a group? Background : Such questions were studied a bit by Sylow and more heavily by Frobenius.  The theorem that the number of elements of order p is equal to −1 mod p is contained in one of Frobenius's 1903 papers.  Since elements of order 3 come in pairs, this doubles to give 2 mod 6 for p=3. However, Frobenius's results were improved some 30 years later by P. Hall who showed that if the Sylow p-subgroups are not cyclic, then the number of elements of order p is −1 mod p 2 . If the Sylows are cyclic of order p n , then the number of subgroups of order p is congruent to 1 mod p n by the standard counting method.  If the Sylow itself is order p, then the subgroup generated by the elements of order p acts faithfully and transitively on the Sylow subgroups, so for small enough numbers, the subgroup can just be looked up. In all cases, we can assume the group is finite since the subgroup generated by the elements of a fixed order is finite (assuming there are only finitely many elements of that fixed order). Easier example : For instance there is no group with exactly 68 elements of order 3, since such a group would have cyclic Sylow 3-subgroups by Hall, order 3 Sylows by the counting, but then would have 34 Sylow 3-subgroups, and so (the subgroup generated by the elements of order 3 would) be a primitive group of degree 34.  One checks the list of primitive groups of degree 34 (that is, A 34 and S 34 , both with ginormous Sylow 3-subgroups) to see no such group exists. One could also try 140, but the action need not be primitive so the table lookup is harder.  Such a group has Sylows of order 3, but is not solvable, so is somewhat restricted.","The number of elements of order 2 in a group is fairly restricted: 0, odd, or infinity.

74,How does one compute the sign of a permutation?,How does one compute the sign of a permutation?,,"The sign of a permutation $\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_n$, written ${\rm sgn}(\sigma)$, is defined to be +1 if the permutation is even and -1 if it is odd, and is given by the formula $${\rm sgn}(\sigma) = (-1)^m$$ where $m$ is the number of transpositions in the permutation when written as a product of transpositions. Alternatively the sign is -1 if, when we express $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles, the result contains an odd number of even-length cycles. Otherwise the sign is +1.

Assume now that $|G| = n^2$ for some natural number $n$. We can then split the composition table for $G$ into $n^2$ $n\times n$ squares, and we can ask whether the resulting table is a solved sudoku (of size $n^2\times n^2$ rather than the usual $9\times 9$). When making the composition table for $G$, there are two choices to be made. One is the ordering of the elements for the rows, and the other is an ordering of the elements for the columns. By looking at the row and column corresponding to the identity, one can see that if we pick the same ordering for rows and columns, then  the composition table cannot be a sudoku (if we label the entries in the composition table as $a_{i,j}$ and the row/column corresponding to the identity is $k$ then we have $a_{k-1,k} = a_{k,k-1}$ and $a_{k+1,k} = a_{k,k+1}$ and at least one of these pairs belong to the same $n\times n$ square). If $G$ is cyclic, then we can indeed make the composition table a sudoku as follows: Write $G = \{0,1,\dots ,n^2 - 1\}$ (identified with the integers mod $n^2$).

My question is: For what groups is it possible to find orderings of the rows and columns that turn the composition table into a sudoku?

I was reminded of this blog post while reading another blog post by the very same author on the orbit-stabilizer theorem of basic group theory. This theorem has always seemed pretty obvious to me, but when I try to follow the several proofs of it that Gowers gives for it in this post I have such a hard time of it that I have to wonder if it is now I who has been taking for obvious what really isn't. My thinking goes something like this: Let $G$ be a group that acts on a set $X$, let $x$ be an element of $X$, let $O_x$ be the orbit of $x$ and let $S_x$ be the stabilizer of $x$.  (The last sentence is lifted verbatim from Gowers' post.)  We want to show that $|G| = |O_x||S_x|$.  Now, $S_x$ is (obviously) a subgroup of $G$, and the formula to be proved is just Lagrange's theorem applied to this subgroup.  This is because two elements of $G$ send $x$ to the same element of $O_x$ if and only if they belong to the same coset of $S_x$, and therefore $|O_x| = [G:S_x]$.  More formally, the map $gS_x \mapsto gx$ is injective, because $$gx = hx \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}gx = x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}g \in S_x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gS_x = hS_x,$$ or, taking the contrapositive, $$gS_x \neq hS_x  \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gx \neq hx.$$ It is also surjective, since every $gx \in O_x$ is the image of $gS_x$ under this map. It's a bit painful to see how much writing it takes to spell out a perception that in my mind is literally instantaneous.

More formally, the map $gS_x \mapsto gx$ is injective, because $$gx = hx \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}gx = x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; h^{-1}g \in S_x \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gS_x = hS_x,$$ or, taking the contrapositive, $$gS_x \neq hS_x  \; \; \Rightarrow \; \; gx \neq hx.$$ It is also surjective, since every $gx \in O_x$ is the image of $gS_x$ under this map. It's a bit painful to see how much writing it takes to spell out a perception that in my mind is literally instantaneous.  Even so, the reasoning above, as belabored as it is, is, IMO, more succinct and straightforward than Gowers'. Am I missing something?",,['group-theory']

This is an excercise from Artin's Algebra: Let $C$ be the commutator subgroup of $G$. Prove that $G/C$ is abelian. Here is what I've done: Let $xC,yC \in G/C$ then $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}C = C$ since $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ is a commutator hence belongs to $C$. But then $xyC = yxC$ so $xC$ and $yC$ commute in $G/C$. This can be done for any elements, so $G/C$ is abelian. This seems somewhat surprisingly short. Is that all there is to it? Regards","Trying to get my head around the commutator subgroup.

98,Ignoring elements of small order in the simple group of order $60$,Ignoring elements of small order in the simple group of order,60,"The simple group of order $60$ can be generated by the permutations $(1,2)(3,4)$ and $(1,3,5)$, but all you need to do is square the first one and it becomes the identity.  Can't we find a version of the simple group where the elements of small order can be ignored? For a group $H$, define $Ω_n(H)$ to be the subgroup generated by elements of order less than $n$.  For instance, if $n=3$ and $H=\operatorname{SL}(2,5)$ is the perfect group of order $120$, then $Ω_n(H)$ has order $2$, and $H/Ω_n(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$.  If $n=4$ and $H=\operatorname{SL}(2,5)⋅3^4$ is the perfect group of order $(60)⋅(162)$ whose $3$-core is not complemented, then $Ω_n(H)$ has order $162$ and $H/Ω_n(H)$ is again the simple group of order $60$. My first question is if there are smaller examples for $n=4$, since the jump $1$, $2$, $162$ seems a bit drastic for $n=2, 3, 4$. Is there a group $H$ of order less than $(60)⋅(162)$ such that $H/Ω_4(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$? Probably, for each positive integer $n$, there is a finite group $H$ such that $H/Ω_n(H)$ is the simple group of order $60$.  I am interested in whether such $H$ can be chosen to be ""small"" somehow. Is there a sequence of finite groups $H_n$ and a constant $C$ such that $H_n/Ω_n(H_n)$ is the simple group of order $60$ and such that $|H_n| ≤ C⋅n$? I would also be fine with some references to where such a problem is discussed.  It would be nice if there was some sort of analogue to the Schur multiplier describing the largest non-silly kernel, and a clear definition of what a silly kernel is (I think it is too much to ask for a non-silly kernel to be contained in the Frattini subgroup, and I think it might be unreasonable to ask for the maximum amongst minimal kernels). In case it helps, here are some reduced cases that I know can be handled: A simpler example: if instead of the simple group of order $60$, we concentrate on the simple group of order $2$, then we can choose $H_n$ to be the cyclic group of order $2^{1+\operatorname{lg}(n−1)}$ when $n≥2$, and the order of $H_n$ is bounded above and below by multiples of $n$.  We can create much larger $H_n$ for $n≥3$ by taking the direct product of our small $H_n$ with an elementary abelian $2$-group of large order, but then $Ω_n(H_n×2^n) = Ω_n(H_n)×2^n$ has just become silly since the entire elementary abelian $2$-group part, $2^n$, is unrelated and uses a lot of extra generators, that is, it is not contained within the Frattini subgroup. A moderate example: if instead of the simple group of order $60$, we take the non-abelian group of order $6$, then I can find a natural choice of $H_n$ with $|H_n| ≤ C⋅n$, but I am not sure if there are other reasonable choices.  My choice of $H_n$ has $Φ(H_n)=1$, which suggests to me that Frattini extensions may not be the right idea.","The simple group of order $60$ can be generated by the permutations $(1,2)(3,4)$ and $(1,3,5)$, but all you need to do is square the first one and it becomes the identity.
