6,Is a Bundle whose Fibers are Homeomorphic a Fiber Bundle?,Is a Bundle whose Fibers are Homeomorphic a Fiber Bundle?,,"To avoid problems with the notoriously inconsistent notation/formalisms of geometry, I will define bundles and fiber bundles (as I call them) below: We define a bundle $E \xrightarrow{\pi} B \ $ as a triplet $(E, B, \pi)$ with $E, B$ topological spaces and $\pi: E \to B$ a continuous surjection. We further define the fiber at $x \in B$ as the set $\pi^{-1}(\{x\})$ . A Fiber bundle is a 4-tuple $(E, B, F, \pi)$ with $E, B, F$ topological spaces, $\pi: E \to B$ a continuous surjection, together with a local trivialization $\{(U_i, \varphi_i)\}$ , where $\{U_i\}$ is an open cover of $B$ and $\varphi_i: \pi^{-1}(U_i) \to U_i \times F$ is a homeomorphism such that $\text{proj}_1 \circ \varphi_i \equiv \pi \ $ on $\ \pi^{-1}(U_i)$ . Now, in a lecture series on differential geometry that I am watching, bundles were defined in much the same way except that topological spaces were replaced by topological manifolds. No complaints here. However, a fiber bundle was subsequently defined as a bundle $E \xrightarrow{\pi} B \ $ such that all of the fibers $\pi^{-1}(\{x\})$ were homeomorphic to some common topological manifold $F$ —with no mention of the local triviality condition. My question is: In the case of topological manifolds, does this condition naturally induce the locally trivial condition that appeared before? Does it for general topological spaces? My intuition is that it does not for general topological spaces: Clearly, there exists a family of homeomorphisms $\varphi_x: \pi^{-1}(\{x\}) \to \{x\} \times F$ , and for any $U \subset B$ , we can glue these maps together to obtain $\varphi_U: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times F$ defined point-wise by $\varphi_U(y) := \varphi_{\pi(y)}(y)$ . It's easy to see that this map is bijective independent of $U$ , but I see no reason to suspect bi-continuity even with ""nice"" choices in $U$ as—roughly speaking—we don't have any information about how this map behaves when moving transverse to the fibers. Perhaps this construction is too artificial, but it seemed compelling enough to me. In the case where the base space, total space, and common fiber are topological manifolds, I wouldn't be surprised if the chart maps could be used to construct a local trivialization but I'm not sure how to explicitly construct it at the moment.","To avoid problems with the notoriously inconsistent notation/formalisms of geometry, I will define bundles and fiber bundles (as I call them) below: We define a bundle as a triplet with topological spaces and a continuous surjection.

We can adjoin a unit element $e$ to $C_0(X)$ which yields the unital C*-Algebra $\widetilde{C_0(X)}$. On the other side, we can compactify $X$ to $X^*$ and consider the C-*-algebra of continuous functions $C(X^*)$: $$ X \to C_0(X) \to \widetilde{C_0(X)} \\ X \to X^* \to C(X^*) $$ Interestingly both paths have the same result modulo isomorphic equivalence, i.e. $$ \widetilde{ C_0(X) } \overset{\text{C*}}{\simeq} C(X^*). $$ Reading about this in Pedersen's Analysis Now , p.129: If a Banach algebra $\mathfrak A$ has no unit, we may try to embed it isometrically into a larger unital Banach algebra $\mathfrak B$, in such a way that $\mathfrak A$ becomes an ideal in $\mathfrak B$, so large that every nonzero ideal of $\mathfrak B$ has a nonzero intersection with $\mathfrak A$ (an essential ideal).

Let $\Omega_n$ be a volume form on $S^n$ normalized to 1, and consider its pullback $f^*\Omega_n$. We verify it is closed and can be written as $f^*\Omega_n=d\omega_{n-1}$, $\omega_{n-1}\in \Omega^{n-1}(S^{2n-1})$. The Hopf invariant is defined as $$H(f)\equiv \int_{S^{2n-1}}\omega_{n-1}\wedge\mathrm d \omega_{n-1}.$$ After a few more questions, we are asked to compute $H(\pi)$, with $n=2$. My approach was to take the god given volume element $vol_{\mathbb R^3}=\mathrm d\xi^1\wedge\mathrm d\xi^2\wedge\mathrm d\xi^3$ and take the interior product with a vector field everywhere normal to the 2-sphere, $N=\sum_i \xi^i\partial_{\xi^i}$, to obtain the volume form on $S^2$, $$vol_{S^2}=\xi^1 \mathrm d\xi^2\wedge\mathrm d\xi^3-\xi^2 \mathrm d\xi^1\wedge\mathrm d\xi^3+\xi^3 \mathrm d\xi^1\wedge\mathrm d\xi^2.$$ I don't care about the normalization yet so I take this to be $\Omega_2$. However, when I pull it back with $\pi$ the result is horribly long, and I won't even post it here. After that, I have, modulo my own errors in arithmetic, the result $\mathrm d \omega_1$, but I also need $\omega_1$. Everything just seems hopeless. I could get it by solving a system of PDEs but that seems also inaccessible. I found a similar calculation in Topology for physicists by Schwarz and Levy, p.165: The (7.4.1) they mention is just the integral definition of the invariant, whereas (6.3.1) is a volume form for the n-sphere $$\omega = \frac{1}{(1+\sum (x^i)^2)^n} \mathrm dx^1\wedge\dots\wedge\mathrm dx^n.$$ They haven't specified $f:S^3\rightarrow S^2$ anywhere, and their entire calculation is unclear to me. How did they get the one-form $\sigma$? In one of the questions, we are asked to prove that the invariant does not depend on the choice of $\omega_{n-1}$ - so did the authors simply take $d\omega_{n-1}$ to be the volume form (6.3.1) on the 2-sphere in spherical coordinates?

On the other hand, if the interval has length less than $2\pi$, then its image is an ""open arc"" on $S^1$, which can be realized as an intersection of $S^1$ with an appropriately chosen open box of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as illustrated below. My question: How can I formalize this last bit, so as to avoid arguing from a figure only? My current attempts at constructing the desired box precisely have relied on checking cases. Is there a more elegant way?",,['general-topology']

There is a well-known result which characterizes when a map $f\colon Y\to X$ (where $Y$ is also Hausdorff) is a finite covering space in more generally used topological terms. Fact (e.g. see [Ho, Lemma 2]): The map $f\colon Y\to X$ is a finite covering space if and only if the following two conditions hold: $f$ is a local homeomorphism, $f$ is proper (*). I am interested in understanding whether or not (again perhaps with stronger assumptions on $X$ ) there exists a version of this fact with ‘finite covering space’ replaced by ‘covering space’. Or, perhaps more realistically (since I doubt such a general characterization exists), a more general class of covering spaces which can be characterized in terms similar to this fact. Of course, what needs to be relaxed is that $f$ is proper. For reasons related to my motivation from algebraic geometry, I would like to replace “ $f$ is proper” with “ $f$ is $P$ ” where, intuitively, one has an ‘equality’ $$P=\text{proper}-“\text{quasi-compact}”.$$ For instance, by the contents of Tag 005M (and more explicitly Tag 005R ) one has that $$\text{proper}=\text{quasi-proper}+\text{closed},$$ where one defines a map $f\colon Y\to X$ to be quasi-proper if $f^{-1}(V)$ is quasi-compact for all quasi-compact subsets $V\subseteq X$ (note that since my spaces are going to generally be Hausdorff one can replace ‘quasi-compact’ with ‘compact’). Thus, one might try to replace “proper” with “closed” in the statement of this fact. Of course, “closed” is a very poor choice. For one thing it doesn’t even include the example of the universal covering $\mathbb{R}\to S^1$ . Moreover, “closed” doesn’t even jive with what I am intuitively going for. But maybe this gives an indication of the sort of direction I’d be interested in going. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! (*) Here by proper I mean universally closed as in Tag 005O , but I think that one can do away with the assumption that $X$ (and $Y$ ) are Hausdorff by using a slight modification which is more aligned with my algebro-geometric background.

Munkres, 2nd edition: Theorem. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ ; let $Y$ be compact Hausdorff. Then $f$ is continuous if and only if the graph of $f$ , $$ G_f = \{ \ x \times f(x) \ \vert \ x \in X \ \}, $$ is closed in $X \times Y$ . [ Hint: If $G_f$ is closed and $V$ is a neighborhood of $f \left( x_0 \right)$ , then the intersection of $G_f$ and $X \times (Y-V)$ is closed. Apply Exercise 7.] And, here is Prob. 7, Sec. 26, in Munkres' Topology , 2nd edition: Show that if $Y$ is compact, then the projection $\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X$ is a closed map. Here is a solution to this problem. My Attempt: I think I can slightly generalize Prob. 8, Sec. 26, in Munkres as follows: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces, and let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. (a) If $Y$ is Hausdorff and if $f$ is continuous, then the graph $G_f$ of $f$ is a closed set in the product space $X \times Y$ . (b) If $Y$ is compact and if the graph $G_f$ of $f$ is closed in the product space $X \times Y$ , then the function $f$ is continuous. Am I right? Proof (a): Suppose that $Y$ is a Hausdorff space, and suppose also that the map $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous. We need to show that the graph $G_f$ of $f$ is closed in the product space $X \times Y$ . For this we show that $(X \times Y) - G_f$ is open in $X \times Y$ . Let $x_0 \times y_0$ be a point of $X \times Y$ such that $x_0 \times y_0 \not\in G_f$ . Then $x_0 \in X$ , $y_0 \in Y$ , but $f \left( x_0 \right) \neq y_0$ . Thus $f \left( x_0 \right)$ and $y_0$ are two distinct points in the Hausdorff space $Y$ . So there exist open sets $U_0$ and $V_0$ in $Y$ such that $$ f \left( x_0 \right) \in U_0, \qquad y_0 \in V_0, \qquad \mbox{ and } \qquad U_0 \cap V_0 = \emptyset. \tag{1} $$ As $f \left( x_0 \right) \in U_0$ , so $x_0 \in f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ , where $$ f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \colon= \left\{ \ x \in X \ \colon \ f(x) \in U_0 \ \right\}. $$ And, as $U_0$ is an open set in $Y$ and as $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous, so the set $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ is an open set in $X$ . Thus $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ is a neighborhood of $x_0$ in $X$ . As $x_0 \in f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ and as $y_0 \in V_0$ [Refer to (1) above.], so we can conclude that $x_0 \times y_0 \in f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0$ . And, as $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ is open in $X$ and $V_0$ is open in $Y$ , so $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0$ is open in $X \times Y$ ; in fact, the set $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0$ is a basis element for the product topology on $X \times Y$ . We now show that $$ f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0 \ \subset \ \big(X \times Y \big) - G_f.$$ For this, let $x \times y$ be any point in the set $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0$ . Then $x \in f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right)$ and $y \in V_0$ , and so $x \in X$ such that $f(x) \in U_0$ and $y \in V_0$ . Now as $f(x) \in U_0$ and $y \in V_0$ and as $U_0 \cap V_0 = \emptyset$ [Refer to (1) above.], so $f(x) \neq y$ , and thus $x \times y \not\in G_f$ . But of course $x \times y \in X \times Y$ . Thus $x \times y \in (X \times Y) - G_f$ . Therefore we can conclude that $$ f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0 \subset (X \times Y) - G_f. $$ Thus we have shown that, for every point $x_0 \times y_0$ in $(X \times Y) - G_f$ , there exists a basis element $f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0$ for the product topology on $X \times Y$ such that $$ x_0 \times y_0 \in f^{-1} \left( U_0 \right) \times V_0 \subset (X \times Y) - G_f. $$ So the set $(X \times Y) - G_f$ is open in the product space $X \times Y$ . Hence $G_f$ is closed in $X \times Y$ . Is this proof correct and clear enough? Proof (b): Suppose that $Y$ is compact, and suppose also that the graph $G_f$ of $f$ is closed in the product space $X \times Y$ . We need to show that the map $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous. For this we will have to show that the inverse image $f^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$ for any open set $V$ in $Y$ . Let $V$ be an open set in $Y$ . If $f^{-1}(V)$ is empty, then it is trivially open in $X$ . So we assume that $f^{-1}(V)$ is non-empty. As $V$ is open in $Y$ , so $Y-V$ is closed in $Y$ . And, as $X$ is closed in $X$ and $Y-V$ is closed in $Y$ , so $X \times (Y-V)$ is closed in the product space $X \times Y$ , by Prob. 3, Sec. 17, in Munkres, to which here is a solution. Now as the graph $G_f$ of $f$ is closed in $X \times Y$ by our hypothesis and as $X \times (Y-V)$ is closed in $X \times Y$ , so is the intersection $G_f \cap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big)$ . But we note that $$  \begin{align}  G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big) &= \{\  x \times y \in X \times Y \ \colon \ y = f(x), \ y \not\in V \ \} \\ & = \{ \ x \times f(x) \ \colon \ x \in X, \ f(x) \not\in V \ \}.  \end{align} \tag{2} $$ Now as the topological space $Y$ is compact, so the projection map $\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X$ , defined by $$ \pi_1(x\times y) \colon= x \ \mbox{ for all } x \times y \in X \times Y, \tag{3} $$ is a closed map, by Prob. 7, Sec. 26. And, as the set $G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big)$ is closed in the product space $X \times Y$ and as the projection map $\pi_1 \colon X \times Y \to X$ , defined by (3) above is a closed map, so the set $$ \pi_1 \left( G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big)  \right) \colon= \left\{ \ \pi_1 (x \times y) \ \colon \ x \times y \in G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big) \ \right\}$$ is a closed set in the topological space $X$ . But using the definition of the map $\pi_1$ in (3) above we can write $$ \pi_1 \left( G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big)  \right)   = \left\{ \ x \in X \ \colon \ x \times y \in G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big) \mbox{ for some } y \in Y \ \right\}. \tag{4} $$ Thus from (2) and (4) above we can conclude that $$ \pi_1 \left( G_f \bigcap \big( X \times (Y-V) \big)  \right) = \{ \ x \in X \ \colon \ f(x) \not\in V \ \} = X - f^{-1}(V), $$ using the familiar properties of the inverse images of subsets of the range / codomain of a map between sets. Thus we can conclude that $X - f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in $X$ , which implies that $V$ is open in $X$ , as required. Is this proof correct and clear enough also? Are both parts of my proof correct in each and every step? If so, then is it clearly worded and neatly arranged too? If not, then where are the issues?

First I will give the definition of a generic point that I am used to: Definition I am used to: Let $X$ be a topological space. A point $x\in X$ is a generic point of $X$ if $x$ is dense in $X$. (In particular this implies that if a topological space has a generic point, then the space must be irreducible. So, reducible spaces do not have generic points.) Definition in Qing Liu's book : Let $X$ be a topological space. Given $x,y \in X$, we say $x$ specializes to $y$ iff $y \in \overline{\{x\}}$. We say $x$ is a generic point of $X$ if $x$ is the unique point of $X$ that specializes to $x$. From what I have been able to deduce so far, under Liu's definition of a generic point, reducible spaces can have generic points. For example if we take a ring $A$, then the generic points of $Spec(A)$ (according to Liu's definition) are all the minimal primes of $A$. And certainly, $Spec(A)$ is reducible unless $Nil(A)$ is a prime ideal. Also, Liu's definition implies that if $O \subset X$ is a non-empty open subset and $x \in O$ is a generic point of $O$, then $x$ is a generic point of $X$. So, something that is locally a generic point is also globally a generic point. This is not true for the first definition. So far I had been happily using the first definition of a generic point, but Qing Liu's definition has thrown me a little off-guard. I guess I do not fully understand the motivation behind Qing Liu's definition, and also the need for two different definitions that are clearly not equivalent. Which definition do people generally use? Looking at Wikipedia it seems that the first definition of a generic point of a topological space is more prevalent. Any explanation or motivation for Qing Liu's definition will be useful, along with an explanation (perhaps?) of why there are two different definitions for the same concept. Also, if answers are too long to type up, then references that explain the concept of generic point are more than welcome.

I would be talking about two games here which I played when I was a kid: Game No. 1:  As a kid I used to play these thread games which comprised of wearing a circular loop of thread around the fingers and thumb of both the hands and then sort of “weaving out” various shapes and patterns with this loop of thread. A few images of this are shown below: Game No.2:  I was once asked by my uncle to draw the following pattern without lifting my pencil and I remember trying for whole few months figuring out a solution for this but to no avail. The pattern is depicted in the image below: Now, my question is can I relate the above two games with topology in the sense that is there a way that I can prove mathematically that all the different patterns that I form using the looped thread are topologically the same and that it is impossible in Game 2 to draw the pattern without lifting my pencil. Also, is it possible that if the string game is played with more than one string , say $2$ or $3$ Strings, then can the patterns formed by say $2$ strings be topologically same with that of $3$ strings or a single string.
