0,Understanding blowups at nonreduced loci,Understanding blowups at nonreduced loci,,"Blowing up at a reduced subscheme is geometrically clear to me: it is just like blowing up at a reduced point, and point on the exceptional divisor corresponds to different tangent lines through the base point. However, I always have problem understanding blowing up at a nonreduced subscheme. Is it a geometric way to see it as the reduced cases? As examples, I would like to ask the following questions: Consider the blowup of $\mathbb A^2$ at a double point $x={\rm Spec}(k[x,y]/(x^2,y))$ . What is the exceptional divisor? Is it isomorphic to $\mathbb P^1$ ? Is the blowup smooth? (By the comment of mtrying46, the exceptional divisor is $\mathbb P^1$ but the blow up is not smooth) Consider that first blow up $\mathbb A^2$ at one point and then blow up at one point in the exceptional divisor of the blowup. The composition can be seen as blow up once (at a nonreduced center). Then what is the center? From the two examples above, it seems that blowup at nonreduced center will either result in singularity or central fiber not being projective space. I would like to know whether this is true in general. That is: Suppose $Y$ is the blow up of $X$ at $Z\subset X$ and both $X,Y$ are smooth. If we know every fiber of $Z$ is isomorphic to some $\mathbb P^m$ , can we conclude that $Z$ is reduced? Everything is over $\mathbb C$ . Any comments will be very helpful!","Blowing up at a reduced subscheme is geometrically clear to me: it is just like blowing up at a reduced point, and point on the exceptional divisor corresponds to different tangent lines through the base point.

12,Problem I.4.7 in Hartshorne,Problem I.4.7 in Hartshorne,,"Let $X,Y$ be varieties and suppose we have points $P \in X, Q \in Y$ such that the corresponding local rings are isomorphic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y} \cong \mathcal{O}_{P,X}$ . Then the problem is to show that there exist open sets $P \in U \subset X, Q \in V \subset Y$ and an isomorphism $U \cong V$ that takes $P$ to $Q$ . The solution given in http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/courses/256A/1.4.pdf proceeds as follows: Let $f:\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{P,X}$ be the isomorphism of local rings. We can consider $X,Y$ to be affine varieties of the same affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Moreover, we can take $P=Q=0$ . Let $y_1,\dots,y_n$ be the coordinate functions on $\mathbb{A}^n$ . Since $y_i$ is a regular function on $Y$ , then it can be viewed as an element of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{Q,Y}$ , say $\langle V_i, y_i \rangle$ . Under $f$ it is taken to a germ $\langle U_i, f(y_i) \rangle$ . Define the open set $U$ of $X$ by $U = \cap_i U_i$ . Then we can define a morphism $f^*: U \rightarrow Y$ by sending $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in X$ to $(f(y_1)(a_1,\dots,a_n),\dots,f(y_n)(a_1,\dots,a_n))$ .

I also know that, under suitable hypothesis, $T_p(E)$ can be used to describe all the possible isogenies between $E$ and itself (or another elliptic curve). Now, I learned via Katz-Mazur book on Arithmetic moduli of Elliptic Curves, that it is possible to define an elliptic curve over arbitrary base rings, and even schemes. I was wondering, but I didn't find any good reference, wether or not it is possible to define a kind of global Tate module. In fact, consider $R$ a ring, and $E/R$ an elliptic curve, i.e. a proper, smooth scheme over $R$ equipped with a zero section, and whose fibers are elliptic curves in the usual sense. Then it is proved in Katz-Mazur that this object again comes equipped with a Group structure, so, is it is meaningful to consider the $p^n$-torsion for varying $n$. Is it possible to define a kind of relative version of the Tate module? My guess is to define it as a functor $T_p(E)$, which sends any $R$-algebra $A$ to $T_p(E)(A)=\underset{\underset{n}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}E[p^n](A)$. Clearly this defines a sheaf over the category of $R$-Algebras, being an inverse limit of sheaves. Is it representable? And, is there any beautiful and known result about it? For example situations under which it classifies isogenies of elliptic curves over $R$?

I know that this object satisfies very good properties, e.g. it realizes a representation of the Galois Group of $K$. I also know that, under suitable hypothesis, $T_p(E)$ can be used to describe all the possible isogenies between $E$ and itself (or another elliptic curve). Now, I learned via Katz-Mazur book on Arithmetic moduli of Elliptic Curves, that it is possible to define an elliptic curve over arbitrary base rings, and even schemes. I was wondering, but I didn't find any good reference, wether or not it is possible to define a kind of global Tate module. In fact, consider $R$ a ring, and $E/R$ an elliptic curve, i.e. a proper, smooth scheme over $R$ equipped with a zero section, and whose fibers are elliptic curves in the usual sense. Then it is proved in Katz-Mazur that this object again comes equipped with a Group structure, so, is it is meaningful to consider the $p^n$-torsion for varying $n$. Is it possible to define a kind of relative version of the Tate module? My guess is to define it as a functor $T_p(E)$, which sends any $R$-algebra $A$ to $T_p(E)(A)=\underset{\underset{n}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}E[p^n](A)$. Clearly this defines a sheaf over the category of $R$-Algebras, being an inverse limit of sheaves. Is it representable? And, is there any beautiful and known result about it? For example situations under which it classifies isogenies of elliptic curves over $R$?

More precisely, I would think that $$\cL^{\otimes 2}(X_y)=\left\{ \frac{fz^2}{y^n} \:\middle\vert\: f\in R_n \right\}$$ but if $xz=fz^2y^{-n}$ then $x=fzy^{-n}$ and this is hard to do when we only have a relation for $x^2$.

I can even show that a circle-tangent cubic must only be in the form $y=Ax^3+Cx$ as follows. My attempt to prove that circle-tangent cubics must be odd Consider $y=Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D,A\ne 0$ . We can find the points of intersections of the cubic and the unit circle with $$x^2+(Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D)^2-1=0,$$ which is a polynomial of degree 6. However, noticing that the cubic must be tangent to the circle at all intersection points, all of its distinct roots must be repeated roots. In fact, since the two tails that lead to infinity crosses the circle while being tangent at the intersections, there must be two distinct roots, each with a multiplicity of 3. Naming them $p$ and $q$ , we can rewrite the resultant sextic with $$\begin{align}x^2+(Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D)^2-1\equiv k(x-p)^3(x-q)^3&&(1)\end{align}$$ Replacing $x$ with $-x$ we have $$\begin{align}x^2+(-Ax^3+Bx^2-Cx+D)^2-1\equiv k(x+p)^3(x+q)^3&&(2)\end{align}$$ $(1)-(2)$ , we have $$4(Ax^3+Cx)(Bx^2+D)\equiv k\left((x-p)^3(x-q)^3-(x+p)^3(x+q)^3\right).$$ Plugging $x=p$ , we have $$\begin{align}(Ap^3+Cp)(Bp^2+D)\equiv -2kp^3(p+q)^3&&(3)\end{align}$$ and plugging $x=q$ , we have $$\begin{align}(Aq^3+Cq)(Bq^2+D)\equiv -2kq^3(p+q)^3&&(4)\end{align}$$ Assuming $p,q\ne 0$ , and we notice that on the right hand side $\frac{(3)}{p^3}\equiv \frac{(4)}{q^3}$ , so $$ \begin{align} \frac{(Ap^3+Cp)(Bp^2+D)}{p^3}&\equiv \frac{(Aq^3+Cq)(Bq^2+D)}{q^3}\\ \left(Ap+\frac Cp\right)\left(Bp+\frac Dp\right)&\equiv \left(Aq+\frac Cq\right)\left(Bq+\frac Dq\right)\\ ABp^2+\frac{CD}{p^2}&\equiv ABq^2+\frac{CD}{q^2} \end{align} $$ In order to make the identity hold, the only conclusion is that $p=-q$ (since $p\neq q$ ) or $AB=CD=0$ . If $p=-q$ , then $(1)$ can be rewritten as $$x^2+(Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D)^2-1\equiv k(x^2-p^2)^3$$ Since the right hand side is even, so does the left hand side. This gives that the cubic must be odd. On the other hand, if $AB=CD=0$ , then obviously $B=0$ . With this, the $x^5$ term of the resultant sextic disappears, and according to Vieta's theorem $3p+3q=0$ , giving $p=-q$ , and from above we have $D=0$ as well.

78,When $\phi_{\mathcal L}=0$ for $\mathcal L$ a line bundle over an abelian scheme $X/S$,When  for  a line bundle over an abelian scheme,\phi_{\mathcal L}=0 \mathcal L X/S,"Let $X\rightarrow S$ be a projective abelian scheme. To a line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X$ , we associate its Mumford line bundle $\Lambda(\mathcal L):= \mu^{\star}\mathcal L\otimes p_1^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}\otimes p_2^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}$ on $X\times_S X$ where $\mu$ is the group law, and $p_i$ the projection morphisms. This defines a homomorphism $\phi_{\mathcal L}:X\rightarrow \hat{X}$ of $X$ into its dual. Eventually, denote by $\mathcal P$ the Poincaré sheaf on $X\times_S \hat{X}$ trivialized along $\epsilon\times id$ , where $\epsilon$ is the unit section of $X$ . Claim: Assume that $\mathcal L\cong (id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P$ for some section $\hat{x}:S\rightarrow \hat{X}$ . Then $\phi_{\mathcal L}=0$ . The hypothesis $\mathcal L\cong (id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P$ means that the $S$ -point of $\mathcal{Pic}_{X/S}$ defined by the line bundle $\mathcal L$ on $X=X\times_S S$ factors through $\hat{X}$ , and it is exactly $\hat{x}$ . The paper I am reading (Genestier and Ngô's lecture on Shimura varieties) gives as a justification that the statement is trivial for $\mathcal L\cong \mathcal O_X$ , and that we can continously deform a general $\mathcal L$ to $\mathcal O_X$ using rigidity lemma to obtain the desired result. I have trouble writing down a rigorous proof for this. Given an $S$ -scheme $T$ and a $T$ -valued point $z$ of $X$ , at the level of points, $\phi_{\mathcal L}(z)$ is the element of $Pic_{X/S}(T)$ determined by the pullbak of $\Lambda(\mathcal L)$ by $id\times z$ . I must somehow prove that this pullback on $X\times_S T$ is actually the pullback of some line bundle on $T$ . It would be true if I could prove that $\Lambda(\mathcal L)$ is the pullback by $p_2$ of some line bundle on $X$ . Thus I am looking at $\mu^{\star}\mathcal L\otimes p_1^{\star}\mathcal L^{-1}\cong \mu^{\star}(id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P\otimes p_1^{\star}(id\times\hat{x})^{\star}\mathcal P^{-1}$ . I naturally considered the morphism $(id\times\hat{x})\mu - (id\times\hat{x})p_1: X\times_S X\rightarrow X\times_S \hat{X}$ , which we can look as a map between two abelian schemes over $X$ (with structure morphisms the second projection at the start, the first projection at the target). This map sends the unit section on the unit section, hence by rigidity it is a group homomorphism. But I am stuck there, I do not see how to progress further. Would somebody be able to give a hand there ? Edit : I actually just noticed that my last argument is not true, the map $(id\times\hat{x})\mu - (id\times\hat{x})p_1$ isn't sending the unit to the unit after all.

80,Smooth proper variety over $\mathbb Q$ with everywhere bad reduction,Smooth proper variety over  with everywhere bad reduction,\mathbb Q,"$\newcommand{\Spec}{\operatorname{Spec}}$ It is a well-known fact that a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb Q$ has good reduction almost everywhere, i.e. everywhere apart from finitely many points. In the language of schemes, this is almost obvious -- given projective equations of the variety $X/\mathbb Q$ , for some $n$ we can construct a projective model $\mathcal X\to\Spec\mathbb Z[1/n]$ of $X$ . Since a projective morphism is proper and the singular locus of $\mathcal X$ is closed, the set of points of $\Spec\mathbb Z[1/n]$ with singular fibers is closed, hence finite (since the generic fiber is smooth). When I've first learned this proof, it seemed somewhat clear to me this works for smooth proper varieties over $\mathbb Q$ , but my professor has pointed out that while the latter part of the argument goes through, there may be problems in constructing a model over a subscheme of $\Spec\mathbb Z$ . He couldn't, off the top of his head, answer whether such varieties could have infinitely many places of bad reduction, but he speculated the answer is yes. This is my question: Can a smooth proper variety over $\mathbb Q$ have infinitely many places of bad reduction?

Hartshorne doesn't give any justification for this last statement.  I've come up with a justification which I think holds, but I haven't seen it written down anywhere and I don't quite trust myself to do commutative algebra, so, two questions: Is the following result true, and its proof valid? Is this the intended justification? Proposition. Let $S$ be a graded ring, $M = \bigoplus\limits_{d=0}^\infty M_d$ a graded $S$-modules, and $$\bigoplus\limits_{d=n}^\infty M_d \subseteq N \subseteq M$$ a graded $S$-submodule.  For each $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} S$, we have $N_{(\mathfrak{p})} = M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$. Proof. Write $T$ for the set of homogeneous elements in $S \setminus \mathfrak{p}$, so that $S_{(\mathfrak{p})} = (T^{-1}S)_0$, $M_{(\mathfrak{p})} = (T^{-1}M)_0$, and so forth.  Clearly $N_{(\mathfrak{p})} \subseteq M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$.  Consider an element $\frac{m}{t} \in M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$. Since $S_+ \not \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ we can find some homogeneous $v \in S_+$ with $v \not \in \mathfrak{p}$.  Then $v$ is both an element of $S$ of positive degree and a unit of $T^{-1} S$.  It follows that $mv^n$ must have degree at least $n$, so $$mv^n \in \bigoplus\limits_{d=n}^\infty M_d \subseteq N.$$ Consequently, $$\frac{m}{t} = \frac{m v^n}{t v^n} \in N_{(\mathfrak{p})}.$$ As a corollary, any map of $S$-modules that was surjective in sufficiently high degree would necessarily  induce a surjective map of sheaves on $\operatorname{Proj} S$.","In the proof of Theorem II.8.13 in Hartshorne (which is the Euler sequence), the author writes: Let $S = A[x_0, \ldots, x_n]$.

I've come up with a justification which I think holds, but I haven't seen it written down anywhere and I don't quite trust myself to do commutative algebra, so, two questions: Is the following result true, and its proof valid? Is this the intended justification? Proposition. Let $S$ be a graded ring, $M = \bigoplus\limits_{d=0}^\infty M_d$ a graded $S$-modules, and $$\bigoplus\limits_{d=n}^\infty M_d \subseteq N \subseteq M$$ a graded $S$-submodule.  For each $\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Proj} S$, we have $N_{(\mathfrak{p})} = M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$. Proof. Write $T$ for the set of homogeneous elements in $S \setminus \mathfrak{p}$, so that $S_{(\mathfrak{p})} = (T^{-1}S)_0$, $M_{(\mathfrak{p})} = (T^{-1}M)_0$, and so forth.  Clearly $N_{(\mathfrak{p})} \subseteq M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$.  Consider an element $\frac{m}{t} \in M_{(\mathfrak{p})}$. Since $S_+ \not \subseteq \mathfrak{p}$ we can find some homogeneous $v \in S_+$ with $v \not \in \mathfrak{p}$.  Then $v$ is both an element of $S$ of positive degree and a unit of $T^{-1} S$.  It follows that $mv^n$ must have degree at least $n$, so $$mv^n \in \bigoplus\limits_{d=n}^\infty M_d \subseteq N.$$ Consequently, $$\frac{m}{t} = \frac{m v^n}{t v^n} \in N_{(\mathfrak{p})}.$$ As a corollary, any map of $S$-modules that was surjective in sufficiently high degree would necessarily  induce a surjective map of sheaves on $\operatorname{Proj} S$.",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra', 'proof-verification']"
