This is undesirable for me. Is there a different transition function I can use that doesn't have this ""hump""? Maybe some exponential function?","I have two functions that are approximately linear. To keep thing simple, I will deal with linear functions in the following. Lets take $f(x)=x+15$ and $g(x)=3x+2$. I would like to stitch these functions together at the point $x=6$. For that I currently use a $\tanh$-function: $s(x) = 0.5+0.5\tanh((x-6)/w)$, where $w$ a width. So I ultimately get the function $h(x)=s(x)f(x) + (1-s(x))g(x)$ that looks like this This works as intended, however, at the transition point $x_0=6$ $h(x)$ has a small ""hump"", so $h(x)$ is pushed upwards relative to $f(x)$ at the transition point.

Step 1: To show $f(A) \setminus f(B) \subseteq f(A \setminus B)$ we need to show the following implication: $$y \in f(A) \setminus f(B) \implies y \in f(A \setminus B)$$ Step 2: Our next step is to understand which $x \in X$ relate to $f(A) \setminus f(B)$ .

The missing pieces to this puzzle has bugged me for some time, but now I think I might be getting close to closure, and not the topological kind- excuse the pun.
