Is my thinking here correct?","""Take $X=C([0,1])$ with the uniform norm, $\|f\|=\sup_{x\in[0,1]}|f(x)|$, and define the operator $T:X\to X$ by,   $$T(f)(x)=f(x)-\int_0^1f(s)ds$$   Show that $T$ is not a surjection"" . Here is what I have done: Saying that $T$ is not a surjection means that $\exists\, g\in X:\nexists f\in X:Tf=g$ So we consider, $$T(f)(x)=f(x)-\int_0^1f(s)ds=g(x)$$ $$\implies\int_0^1f(x)dx-\int_0^1\int_0^1f(s)ds\,dx=\int_0^1g(x)dx$$ $$\implies0=\int_0^1g(x)dx$$ In the solutions I have, it says that two functions are equal if we obtain the same value after evaluating their integrals over the interval. Is this enough to show that $T$ is not a surjection? I am not entirely convinced. Clearly the only $g\in X$ for which this holds is $g=0$, the zero function in $X$. But since $g\in X$ was arbitrary, and not every $g\in C([0,1])$ satisfies $\int_0^1g(x)dx=0$, $T$ is not a surjection?

If $\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}f(x)=\infty$ and $\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}g(x)=-\frac{1}{2}$. What do you expect the value of $\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+} f(x)g(x) $ to be? Confirm your guess by using the appropriate definition of a limit. So I expect that the value of $\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}f(x)g(x)=-\infty$ The definition of a limit is: if $\forall \epsilon >0$ $ \exists \delta=\delta(\epsilon,x_0)$ such that $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$ for all x $0< |x-x_0|<\delta$ I know that $\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}f(x)g(x) = \lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}f(x)*\lim \limits_{x \to x_0+}g(x)$ I understand how to find the limits for $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, but how can I prove their product? Is it as simple as saying that any constant multiplied by a divergent series is a divergent series? What could be my value for $\delta$ that proves this to be true?",,"['limits', 'functions']"

Then, there exists $1\leq k\leq n$, s.t. that $y\in U_{x_k}$. Then $f(y)<f(x_k)+\epsilon\leq f(x_m)+\epsilon$. As $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, $f(y)\leq f(x_m)$. Somehow, I am sceptic about this proof, as it seems too simple. Any thoughts?","I was wondering, if there are any mistakes, in this proof of the extreme value theorem: Theorem . Let $X$ be a compact set and $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, s.t. $f$ is continuous. Then there exists $x\in X$, s.t. for all $y\in X$, $f(y)\leq f(x)$. Proof . Let $\epsilon>0$, $x\in X$ and $U_x=f^{-1}(-\infty,f(x)+\epsilon)$. As $f$ is continuous, $U_x$ is open. Also, $x\in U_x$. Then $\{U_x\}_{x\in X}$ is an open cover of $X$. As $X$ is compact, there exists $x_1,\dots,x_n\in X$, s.t. that $\{U_{x_k}\}_{1\leq k\leq n}$ is an open cover of $X$. Let $1\leq m\leq n$, such that $f(x_m)=\max_{1\leq k\leq n}f(x_k)$ and $y\in X$. Then, there exists $1\leq k\leq n$, s.t. that $y\in U_{x_k}$. Then $f(y)<f(x_k)+\epsilon\leq f(x_m)+\epsilon$. As $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, $f(y)\leq f(x_m)$.
