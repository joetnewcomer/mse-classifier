0,Closure of the difference of two sets vs difference of their closures,Closure of the difference of two sets vs difference of their closures,,"This exercise is from Chapter 2, Section 17, number 8 (c), pag. 101, from Munkres's Topology. Let $A$, $B$ denote subsets of a space $X$. Determine whether the following equation holds: $$\overline {A - B} = \overline A - \overline B.$$ If it fails, determine whether one of the inclusions $\supset$ or $\subset$ holds. This exercise was very difficult for me. I tried the following way. Let $A^\prime$ be the set of all the limit points of $A$ that not belong to $A$; that is, $A \bigcap A^\prime = \varnothing$. Let $B^\prime$ be the set of all the limit points of $B$ that not belong to $B$; that is, $B \bigcap B^\prime = \varnothing$. By last, let $C$ be the set of all the limit points of $A - B$ that not belong to $A - B$; then, $(A - B) \bigcap C = \varnothing$. We proceed by contradiction. We have that $\overline A - \overline B = (A \bigcup A^\prime) - (B \bigcup B^\prime)$. Assume that there exists a point $x$ such that $x \in (\overline A - \overline B)$, but $x \not\in \overline {A - B}$. Then, the point $x$ does not belong neither to $B$ nor to $B^\prime$, because in such case $x$ would not belong to $\overline A - \overline B$. Besides, it can not belong to $A$ either, because in this case it would also belong to $\overline {A - B}$. Assume that $x \in A^\prime$; in such case, $x$ is one of the limit points of $A$ that not belong to $A$. Now, $x \not\in C$, because in this case it would also be in $\overline {A - B}$, which contradicts our initial hypothesis. But, to explain that $x \not\in C$, it is necessary to assume that $B$ extract from $A$ a subset which does not contain $x$, but it has $x$ as limit point . In such case, $x$ would be a limit point of $B$ as well, and this implies $x \in B$ or $x \in B^\prime$, contradicting our prior assertion. Therefore, it is not possible that $x \in (\overline A - \overline B)$ and $x \not\in \overline {A - B}$. It follows that $\overline {A - B} \supset \overline A - \overline B$. I'm not sure of this proof. Someone can tell me if there is another way of solving it? Thanks. Example of non-equality. Let $(0, 2)$ and $(1, 3]$ be intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. Then, the difference between the intervals is $(0, 1]$, and the closure of the difference is $[0, 1]$.

Let $L_\mathbb{Q}(c)=\{(x,y) \in L(c): y \in \mathbb{Q}\}$ and $L_{\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}}(c)=\{(x,y) \in L(c): y \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}\}$. Let $E$ be the set of the endpoints of the intervals that are deleted in the construction of the Cantor set, together with $0$ and $1$. Cantor's leaky tent (or Knaster-Kuratowski fan ) is defined as $$T=\bigcup_{c \in E} L_\mathbb{Q}(c) \cup \bigcup_{c \in C\setminus E} L_{\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}}(c), $$ and equipped with the induced Euclidean topology. By the way, it has the peculiar property that it is a connected space but the subspace $T \setminus \{p\}$ is totally disconnected (see Examples 128 and 129 in Counterexamples in topology by Steen & Seebach). Definition of Cantor's leakier tent: Cantor's leakier tent is a kind of inverse or complement of the Cantor's leaky tent. It is defined as $$ T'=\bigcup_{c \in E} L_{\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}}(c) \cup \bigcup_{c \in C\setminus E} L_\mathbb{Q}(c), $$ equipped with the induced Euclidean topology as well. Question: It it said that Cantor's leakier tent is a zero-dimensional space which means it has a basis consisting of open and closed sets, in other words for every point $x \in T'$ and a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ there is an open and closed set inside $U$ containing $x$. How to see this? Given a point $x \in T'$ and a neighborhood $U$ of $x$, perhaps we could enclose the point $x$ with a finite number of line segments which avoid the set $T'$ completely and stay inside $U$. The points of $T'$ inside this enclosure would then be an open and closed set containing $x$. Would this be possible?",,['general-topology']
19,"Where does ""A family of compact sets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection"" lie between $T_1$ and $T_2$?","Where does ""A family of compact sets with the finite intersection property has nonempty intersection"" lie between  and ?",T_1 T_2,"This question is a follow-up of sorts to a recent question by Steven Clontz about the property that (arbitrary) intersections of compact sets are compact (abbreviated "" $IKK$ "" in that question). I am interested in a stronger property ("" $KIP$ "" defined below), and where $KIP+T_1$ lies between $T_1$ and $T_2$ . I'll give definitions and some results, then conclude with my question and attempts. Definition. Throughout, we say a family of sets $\mathcal F$ has the finite intersection property ( $FIP$ ) if every finite intersection $F_1\cap\dots\cap F_n$ , with each $F_k\in \mathcal F$ , is nonempty. Let $X$ be a topological space.  We say $X$ has the compact intersection property (abbreviated "" $KIP$ "") if every family of compact subsets of $X$ with the $FIP$ has nonempty intersection. Below, we shall often abuse grammar and say things like "" $X$ is $KIP$ "" do indicate $X$ has the compact intersection property. It is immediate that any space in which compact subsets are closed ("" $KC$ "") must be $KIP$ .  In particular, this holds for all Hausdorff spaces. Consequences. Lemma 1. $KIP\implies IKK$ Proof. Let $X$ be $KIP$ , and suppose $\mathcal K$ is a family of compact sets.  We wish to show $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. To this end, suppose $\mathcal C$ is a family of (relatively) closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ , having the finite intersection property.  Let $\mathcal S$ be the family of all closed subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S\cap \bigcap\mathcal K\in \mathcal C$ .  Then for any finite collections $S_1,\dots,S_n\in \mathcal S$ and $K_1,\dots,K_n\in \mathcal K$ , we have $$\bigcap_{i=1}^n(K_i\cap S_i)\supseteq (S_1\cap\dots\cap S_n)\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\neq \emptyset,$$ since the latter intersection is a finite intersection of members of $\mathcal C$ .  Therefore the family $\mathcal K':=\{K\cap S\mid K\in\mathcal K,S\in\mathcal S\}$ is a family of compact sets with the $FIP$ , and thus by $KIP$ has nonempty intersection.  But then $$\emptyset\neq \bigcap \mathcal K'=\left(\bigcap \mathcal K\right)\cap \left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)=\bigcap \mathcal C.$$ Thus every family of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ with the $FIP$ has nonempty intersection, hence $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. Lemma 2. $KIP+T_1\implies US$ (""Convergent sequences have unique limits."") Proof. Suppose $X$ is $T_1$ , and not $US$ .  Let $x_n\in X$ be a sequence with $x_n\to x$ and $x_n\to y$ , $x\neq y$ .  Since $X$ is $T_1$ , $x_n$ must contain infinitely many distinct members, and so we may suppose with no loss of generality that the sequence $x_n$ consists of distinct elements not equal to $x$ or $y$ .  Letting $S_N=\{x_n\mid n\geq N\}\cup \{x\}$ and $T_N=\{x_n\mid n\geq N\}\cup\{y\}$ , we see that $\mathcal K:=\{S_N\mid N\in \mathbb N\}\cup\{T_N\mid N\in \mathbb N\}$ is a family of compact sets with the $FIP$ , yet $\bigcap \mathcal K=\emptyset$ , so $X$ is not $KIP$ . Equivalent formulation. A perhaps more tangible formulation of $KIP$ is the following: Lemma 3. $X$ is $KIP$ if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: Pairwise intersections of compact subsets are compact ("" $IKK_2$ ""). Every family of nonempty compact subsets of $X$ , directed under reverse inclusion, has nonempty intersection (""Nonempty nested compact intersections”, or "" $NKI$ ""). Proof. If $X$ is $KIP$ then the first property follows from Lemma 1, and the second is immediate from the definition, since any family of nonempty subsets directed under reverse inclusion must have the $FIP$ . Conversely, if $X$ satisfies the preceding two properties, and $\mathcal K$ is a family of compact subsets of $X$ with the $FIP$ , then the family $\mathcal K'$ of finite intersections of members of $\mathcal K$ is a directed system of nonempty compact sets, and so $\bigcap \mathcal K=\bigcap\mathcal K'\neq \emptyset$ . In $ZFC$ . So far, everything we have said is valid in $ZF$ .  Now, even in $ZFC$ , a family of nonempty sets directed under reverse inclusion need not have a cofinal chain (consider, as a counter-example, the family of cofinite subsets of any uncountable set).  Nonetheless, in $ZFC$ we may replace the directed families in Lemma 3 with well-ordered chains: Lemma 4. In $ZFC$ , $X$ is $KIP$ if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: Pairwise intersections of compact subsets are compact. Every chain of nonempty compact subsets of $X$ , well-ordered under reverse inclusion, has nonempty intersection. Proof. From Lemma 3, $KIP$ spaces certainly satisfy the preceding properties.  Conversely, we suppose the preceding properties are satisfied, and argue by transfinite induction that for every cardinal $\kappa$ , and every family $\mathcal K$ of compact subsets of $X$ , having the $FIP$ , and cardinality at most $\kappa$ , $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is nonempty and compact. To see this, note the claim is true for finite cardinals.  If it is true for all cardinals $\kappa'<\kappa$ , and $\mathcal K$ has cardinality $\kappa$ , then let $\lambda\mapsto K_\lambda$ be a bijection $\kappa\to \mathcal K$ , and for each $\lambda<\kappa$ define $J_\lambda:=\bigcap_{\alpha\leq \lambda}K_\alpha$ .  Then by inductive assumption $\{J_\lambda\}$ is a well-ordered chain of nonempty compact subsets, so by the second property $\bigcap \mathcal K=\bigcap_{\lambda<\kappa} J_\lambda\neq \emptyset$ . Moreover, if $\mathcal C$ is a family of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ with the $FIP$ , then as in the proof of Lemma 1, we let $\mathcal S$ be the family of all closed subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\in \mathcal C$ .  Then for each $\lambda<\kappa$ , and any finite collection $S_1,\dots,S_n\in\mathcal S$ , we have $$S_1\cap\dots\cap S_n\cap J_\lambda\supseteq S_1\cap\dots \cap S_n\cap \bigcap \mathcal K\neq \emptyset,$$ so the family $\mathcal S_\lambda:=\{S\cap J_\lambda\mid S\in \mathcal S\}$ has the finite intersection property.  Since $J_\lambda$ is compact, we have $J_\lambda\cap \bigcap \mathcal S=\bigcap \mathcal S_\lambda\neq \emptyset$ .  Therefore $\{J_\lambda\cap \bigcap \mathcal S\}$ is a well ordered chain of nonempty compact sets under reverse inclusion, and so $$\bigcap \mathcal C=\left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)\cap \left(\bigcap \mathcal K\right)= \left(\bigcap \mathcal S\right)\cap \left(\bigcap_{\lambda<\kappa} J_\lambda \right)\neq \emptyset.$$ Since this holds for any family $\mathcal C$ of closed subsets of $\bigcap \mathcal K$ satisfying the $FIP$ , $\bigcap \mathcal K$ is compact. Question. In general, $KIP$ spaces need not be $T_1$ , and in fact it is easy to see that every finite topological space is $KIP$ .  Moreover, even in a $T_1$ space, the properties $IKK_2$ and $NKI$ from Lemma 3 are insufficient, separately, to guarantee $US$ :  If only $T_1$ and $IKK_2$ are assumed (or even $IKK$ itself), then the cofinite topology on an infinite set will give an example that is not $US$ .    If only $T_1$ and $NKI$ are assumed, $[0,\omega]$ with a doubled endpoint gives an example that fails $US$ . Therefore it seems $KIP+T_1$ spaces may be reasonable objects of study.  Where does this property fall among other properties between $T_1$ and $T_2$ ?  Particularly, those discussed in this answer ? Attempts. We know that $KC\implies KIP+T_1\implies US$ .  Moreover, the second implication is strict, as can be seen by the example of $[0,\omega_1]$ with a doubled endpoint , which is $US$ , but fails $IKK_2$ , hence fails $KI$ . I suspect the first implication is strict as well (it in fact is, see update), with a possible example in $X=\mathbb Q^*\times\mathbb Q^*$ , the square of the one-point compactification of the rationals . $X$ is not $KC$ (the diagonal being compact and not closed), but $X$ is $NKI$ (this follows from the fact that $\mathbb Q^*$ is $KC$ , hence $KIP$ , hence $NKI$ , and it is relatively straightforward to show that a product of two $T_1$ $NKI$ spaces is again $NKI$ ). However, I ran into trouble trying to determine whether $X$ is $IKK_2$ .  I expect there should be either a straightforward proof of this, or a straightforward counter-example, but both have so far eluded me. Update. I neglected to consider the one point compactification of the Arens-Fort space , discussed here .  Subsets there are compact if and only if they are either finite, or contain the point at infinity.  From this, $KIP$ is immediate, yet this space is not $KC$ or even weak Hausdorff , though it is $k_2$ -Hausdorff . Given that the implication $KC\implies KIP+T_1$ is indeed strict, it remains to show how $KIP+T_1$ relates to the aforementioned properties (i.e., does weak Hausdorff imply $KIP$ , and is there an implication in either direction for $k_2$ -Hausdorff?) or any other weak separation axioms. Addendum. Let me add one additional set of observations that I didn't mention originally.  They weren't particularly fruitful for me, but might be of some use that I didn't see: If $X=(X,\tau)$ is a topological space, let $\tau_{cc}\subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ consist of the co-compact subsets of $X$ , together with the empty set.  Then $\tau_{cc}$ is a topology if and only if $X$ is $IKK$ .  In this case $\tau_{cc}$ is always $T_1$ . $\tau_{cc}$ is a compact topology if and only if $X$ is $KIP$ . $\tau_{cc}\subseteq \tau$ if and only if $X$ is $KC$ . $\tau_{cc}\supseteq \tau$ if and only if $X$ is compact.","This question is a follow-up of sorts to a recent question by Steven Clontz about the property that (arbitrary) intersections of compact sets are compact (abbreviated "" "" in that question).

That is to say, is there a collection of pairwise-disjoint, closed unit segments in the plane such that for each slope, uncountably many have that slope? I feel like the answer is no.  By covering the plane with a sufficiently small tiling of squares you will find, for each slope, some pair in the covering such that each has uncountably many end points of segments with that slope.  Then you can pick a square 'between' that pair relative to this slope such that its boundary is intersected by uncountably many segments twice.  Another counting procedure then forces the existence of a square such that this happens for uncountably many different angles. The details of those parts are trivial, but now I get stuck showing that this is impossible.  Namely, that this compact square can't contain uncountably many families of uncountably many segments spanning its perimeter, each of whose members are disjoint.  It seems to be some order-theoretic statement, since we know that each of these uncountable sets (for a given slope) contains an uncountable closed set.  We can assume it is the Cantor Set for all but countably many, lest we get an uncountable number of pairwise-disjoint neighborhoods of the square. But there is an uncountable collection of pairwise-disjoint Cantor Sets in the unit interval (equivalently, the circle/square perimeter).

Motivation: $\beta \mathbb{N}$ has the property that for every infinite $B \subset \mathbb{N}$, the closure $\bar{B}$ is again  homeomorphic to $\beta \mathbb{N}$  (see Lemma 5 here ).  In particular, $B$ has $2^\mathfrak{c}$ limit points.  Of course, $\beta \mathbb{N}$ is the ""largest possible"" compactification of $\mathbb{N}$. On the other hand, if $X$ is first countable at any point $x$ of $X \setminus \mathbb{N}$, then there is a sequence in $\mathbb{N}$ converging to $x$.  This sequence is thus an infinite set with only one limit point.  So any first countable compactification is ""too small"". I am wondering what is in between.

42,Interior of a Totally Disconnected Set,Interior of a Totally Disconnected Set,,"Let $(\mathbb{R},T)$ be the reals with the standard topology. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Then, If $A$ is totally disconnected, then $\operatorname{Int}(A) = \emptyset$ where $\operatorname{Int}(A)$ refers to the interior of $A$. This can be proven by considering the contrapositive. If $\operatorname{Int}(A)$ is not empty then there is a point $x \in A$ that has an open neighborhood, $V$, such that $V \subset A$. As all open sets in $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology consist of intervals, that means $A$ contains an interval. As intervals are connected and are not singletons, this means $A$ can not be totally disconnected which completes the proof for the contrapositive. The issue I'm having is that I don't want to work only with $\mathbb{R}$ with the standard topology. The property that, If $A$ is totally disconnected, then $\operatorname{Int}(A) = \emptyset$ is not true for general topological spaces. The discrete topological space on $R$ is a counterexample (which also means not all metric spaces satisfy the property).

Let $G_1(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)$ be the game with the following rules: There are two players: ONE and TWO. At each odd step $2n-1$, where $n \in \mathbb N$, ONE picks an open cover $\mathcal U_{2n-1}$ of $X$.

Then, Given a sequence $\mathcal U_{2n-1} = \{ \mathcal U_1, \mathcal U_3, \mathcal U_5, ...  \}$ of open covers of $X$, Start with $\{ \mathcal U_1 \}$, and let $U_2 = F(U_1)$, where $F$ is the winning strategy for TWO.

Under what conditions is $X$ dense in $Y$ ? One condition that I came up with is that $Z$ is locally compact and the inclusion $Y \rightarrow Z$ is proper. In that case the following argument works. Let $y \in Y$ be arbitrary. Then there exists a sequence $\{x_{n}\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in X$ which converges to $y$ with respect to the topology on $Z$ . Now let $U \subset Z$ be a pre-compact open neighbourhood of $y$ . For $n$ larger than $N$ , say, we know that $x_{n} \in U$ . By the assumption that the inclusion of $Y$ in $Z$ is proper, we know that $U \cap Y$ is pre-compact. The sequence $\{ x_{n} \}_{n > N}$ lies in $U \cap Y$ , and hence has a subsequence convergent with respect to the topology on $Y$ , which must converge to $y$ .

83,Equivalence of Path-Connectedness and Arc-Connectedness for Hausdorff Spaces,Equivalence of Path-Connectedness and Arc-Connectedness for Hausdorff Spaces,,"I have a classical sort of question.  If we define a path in a space $X$ from points $a$ to $b$ to be a continuous image $f: I \rightarrow X$ from the unit interval to $X$ such that $f(0) = a$ and $f(1) = b$, then we can define an arc from $a$ to $b$ to be the same except we require that $f$ is a topological embedding, i.e. $f$ is a homeomorphism between $I$ and its image in $X$. We can then define path-connectedness as per usual, and define arc-connectedness to mean that for every $a, b \in X$ there is an arc from $a$ to $b$ in $X$.  It's a well-known theorem that for Hausdorff spaces these two properties are equivalent.  However, the only proof I've seen uses the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem and the Moore/'cut point' characterization of the arc, neither of which are very fun to prove and which require an exposition of the order topology. One of the main applications of these theorems is that every compact, connected, locally connected metric space (the definition of a Peano Continuum ) is locally arc-connected.  Then the equivalence of path-connectedness and arc-connectedness is established as a corollary of this. What I want to do is prove the theorems in the following order: (1a) Path-connectedness and arc-connectedness are equivalent for Hausdorff spaces. (1b) If $X$ is a Peano continuum and $x \in X$ then $x$ has a local basis of Peano (sub)continua. (2) Every Peano continuum is path-connected (more precisely, there is a surjection of $I$ onto $X$, which is the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem). (3) Immediate corollary: Every Peano continuum is locally arc-connected. The proof of (1b) is standard and involves a concept called Property $S$.  I have developed a short, self-contained proof of (2) using an esoteric theorem called the Order Arc Theorem (which I need for other reasons, anyway) and (1b) .  Then (3) follows immediately. So the only task is to prove (1a) ,  the equivalence of arc-connectedness and path-connectedness, in a self-contained manner.  Does anyone know of a proof of this fact that doesn't involve the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz Theorem/Moore classification/order topology?  These theorems are very fundamental and attractive (particularly (1a) ), so it would be nice to have a shorter proof of them so that they could be included in topology courses.  I have sketched a proof; could someone look it over and let me know if there is an error?  If there is, it's probably of the glaring sort haha I assume familiarity with the devil's staircase function $d$ from the standard Cantor ternary set onto $I$.  It can be shown that this function is continuous, and is 1-1 everywhere except the end points of the deleted middle-third intervals, where it is 2-1.  Using the Moore classification of the Cantor set (or by explicit construction), one can show that the set created by recursively removing intervals of sizes other than $\frac{1}{3^n}$ and/or moving their centers also results in a Cantor set that admits an order-preserving homeomorphism $\phi$ with the standard Cantor set.  For a Cantor set $D$ constructed as such, we call the map $d \circ \phi: D \rightarrow I$ a pinching map for $D$. So suppose $X$ is a path-connected Hausdorff space and let $a, b \in X$.  Let $f$ be a path from $a$ to $b$; we need to show there is a bona-fide arc from $a$ to $b$.  After discarding and reparametrizing if need be, since $X$ is Hausdorff we can assume that $f^{-1}(a)$ and $f^{-1}(b)$ are $\lbrace 0 \rbrace$ and $\lbrace 1 \rbrace$ respectively. Let $E_1$ be a (not necessarily unique) largest non-trivial closed interval in $I$ such that its end points have the same image under $f$, i.e. $f(E_1)$ has a 'loop' (existence uses the Hausdorff property again).  If none exists then $f$ is a bijection so we're done.  Assuming otherwise, consider $J_1 = I \setminus E_1^\circ$, where $E_1^\circ$ is the interior of $E_1$.  This chops $I$ into two closed intervals, and we can then repeat inductively, cutting away successive intervals from the interiors (and possibly leaving some intervals intact if $f$ is bijective on them) of remaining intervals.  We end up with a closed set $Z = \cap J_n$ consisting of closed intervals and Cantor sets. Then form the 'pinching map' $g$ of $Z$ by just having the map be linear on the non-trivial intervals in $Z$.  This will be a continuous map - in fact a quotient map - from $Z$ onto $I$ that is 1-1 everywhere except the end-points of the removed intervals $E_k$.  However, $f$ restricted to $Z$ agrees precisely with the identifications of $g$ so by a standard quotient map argument will lift to a continuous map from $I$ to $f(Z)$. But this will be a bijection on $I$ if we can show it's 1-1 on $Z$ everywhere except the end points of the sets $E_n$, and thus will be our desired arc from $a$ to $b$ since continuous bijections on a compact $I$ into a Hausdorff $X$ are homeomorphisms.  Suppose not, i.e. $f(x) = f(y)$ with $x \neq y$.  Then $|x - y| > 0$ but length$(E_n) \rightarrow 0$ since, for example, it's an infinite collection of disjoint intervals in $[0,1]$, impossible.

Then there's a functor $\Pi_0:\mathsf{Top}\rightarrow \mathsf{Set}$ taking a space to its set of connected components. Let $p:E\to B$ be a covering map. The Galois ""groupoid"" of $p$  $$\Pi_0(E\times _B E\times _B E)\rightarrow \Pi_0(E\times _BE) \rightrightarrows \Pi_0(E)$$ is defined as the image along $\Pi _0$ of $$E\times _B E\times _B E\rightarrow E\times _BE \rightrightarrows E$$ where the left arrow forgets the middle element of a triple $(x,y,z)$, and the arrows on the right are the pullback projections (the unit arrow is given by the diagonal). Theorem 6.7.4 of Borceux and Janelidze's Galois Theories says that if $p$ is a universal covering map with connected $E$ (and therefore $B$), then the Galois groupoid is a group isomorphic to $\mathsf{Aut}(p)$ - the group of automorphisms of $p$ (over $B$). I tried to calculate the Galois ""groupoid"" of a covering map with connected $E$ (and therefore $B$) without any further assumptions and found it isomorphic to $\mathsf{End}(p)$: The connectedness of $E$ is equivalent to $\Pi_0(E)=\bf 1$ so there's only one object and the ""groupoid"" is indeed a group has a single object. To calculate $\Pi_0(E\times _BE)$ we use the distributivity of the category of spaces, the fact covering maps have discrete fibers, and the fact $\Pi_0$ is left adjoint to discrete spaces. This shows $$\Pi_0(E\times _BE)\cong \Pi_0(\coprod_b(p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\}\times p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\} ))\cong \coprod_b \Pi_0(p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\}\times p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\}).$$ Now suppose the fibers are of size $n$. Then $|\Pi_0(p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\}\times p^{-1}\left\{ b\right\})|=n^2$, and it seems like $\Pi_0(E\times _BE)$ is comprised of endomorphisms of $p$. Is this reasoning correct? Does it imply that endomorphisms of universal covering maps are automorphisms? What's the intuition for this? Added. My original formulation was misleading: the Galois ""groupoid"" is not generally a groupoid unless $p$ is a principal bundle. I think it's just an internal category in general.

Then there's a functor $\Pi_0:\mathsf{Top}\rightarrow \mathsf{Set}$ taking a space to its set of connected components. Let $p:E\to B$ be a covering map. The Galois ""groupoid"" of $p$  $$\Pi_0(E\times _B E\times _B E)\rightarrow \Pi_0(E\times _BE) \rightrightarrows \Pi_0(E)$$ is defined as the image along $\Pi _0$ of $$E\times _B E\times _B E\rightarrow E\times _BE \rightrightarrows E$$ where the left arrow forgets the middle element of a triple $(x,y,z)$, and the arrows on the right are the pullback projections (the unit arrow is given by the diagonal).

Below is a prelude to the main questions. Let $n$ be a positive integer.  Characterize all subsets $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ can be extended to a continuous function $F:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{C}$.  Here, $\Omega$ inherits the subspace topology from $\mathbb{R}^n$, and of course, $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{C}$ are equipped with their standard topologies. The answer to the question above is that $\Omega$ must be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$.  A slightly more generalized question is given below. Question I: What are all subsets $\Omega$ of a topological space $X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{C}$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to\mathbb{C}$?  As usual, $\Omega$ is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from $X$. Of course, without any nice properties on $X$, it seems impossible to make a characterization of such subspaces $\Omega$.  Hence, with some additional properties on the topology of $X$, the answer may be completely known. I know that, if $X$ is normal, then all closed subsets $\Omega$ of $X$ have the required property, using the Tietze Extension Theorem.  Is there an example of a normal topological space $X$ which contains a non-closed subset $\Omega$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ has a continuous extension to $X$? Question II: Even more generally, let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.  Find all extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, all subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to Y$. Of course, niceness constraints on $X$ and $Y$ may be needed for a complete characterization.  For example, if $X$ is a metric space, $Y$ is a convex subset of a locally convex topological vector space, and $\Omega$ is a closed subspace of $X$, then any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended to a continuous function $F:X\to Y$.  See for example here (although there is no mentioning that closed sets are all such sets). This paper discusses strongly good pairs , namely, pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that every $\Omega\subseteq X$ is extendable.  It also discusses good pairs , namely pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that, for every $\Omega\subseteq X$ and for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  This gives me an idea for my final question. Question III: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. What are all weakly extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that, for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  We shall call such an extension $F$ a weakly continuous extension of $f$ (relative to $\Omega$). In the case where $X=\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Y=\mathbb{C}$, it is known that any subset $\Omega$ of $X$ is weakly extendable.  In fact, if $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is metrizable, then $(X,Y)$ is a good pair.  What are other resources where a full characterization of weakly extendable subsets is known?","This is a reference request.  Below is a prelude to the main questions. Let $n$ be a positive integer.

Question I: What are all subsets $\Omega$ of a topological space $X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{C}$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to\mathbb{C}$?  As usual, $\Omega$ is equipped with the subspace topology inherited from $X$. Of course, without any nice properties on $X$, it seems impossible to make a characterization of such subspaces $\Omega$.  Hence, with some additional properties on the topology of $X$, the answer may be completely known. I know that, if $X$ is normal, then all closed subsets $\Omega$ of $X$ have the required property, using the Tietze Extension Theorem.  Is there an example of a normal topological space $X$ which contains a non-closed subset $\Omega$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to\mathbb{C}$ has a continuous extension to $X$? Question II: Even more generally, let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces.  Find all extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, all subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended continuously to $F:X\to Y$. Of course, niceness constraints on $X$ and $Y$ may be needed for a complete characterization.  For example, if $X$ is a metric space, $Y$ is a convex subset of a locally convex topological vector space, and $\Omega$ is a closed subspace of $X$, then any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$ can be extended to a continuous function $F:X\to Y$.  See for example here (although there is no mentioning that closed sets are all such sets). This paper discusses strongly good pairs , namely, pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that every $\Omega\subseteq X$ is extendable.  It also discusses good pairs , namely pairs $(X,Y)$ of topological spaces such that, for every $\Omega\subseteq X$ and for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  This gives me an idea for my final question. Question III: Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. What are all weakly extendable subsets $\Omega$ of $X$, namely, subsets $\Omega\subseteq X$ such that, for any continuous function $f:\Omega\to Y$, there exists a function $F:X\to Y$ extending $f$ such that $F$ is continuous at every point in $\Omega$.  We shall call such an extension $F$ a weakly continuous extension of $f$ (relative to $\Omega$). In the case where $X=\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Y=\mathbb{C}$, it is known that any subset $\Omega$ of $X$ is weakly extendable.  In fact, if $Y$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space and $X$ is metrizable, then $(X,Y)$ is a good pair.  What are other resources where a full characterization of weakly extendable subsets is known?",,"['general-topology', 'functions', 'reference-request', 'continuity', 'separation-axioms']"
