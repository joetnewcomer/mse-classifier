0,Why isn't this restriction of a homeomorphism open?,Why isn't this restriction of a homeomorphism open?,,"[I put a PS at the bottom of the text, as I think problem's solved] There is a simple idea that a restriction of a homeomorphism to a subset of its domain yields a new homeomorphism onto its image. I am having problems with certain cases,  where I think that this applies, but my texts conclude that the result is just continuous and bijective. When the domain is in $R^n$ , domain invariance is then used. One example is this homeomorphic manifolds proof by John. He restricts 3 homeomorphisms, concludes that the restriction are homeomorphisms and that is it. I solved this question the same way, the maps are homeomorphic, why wouldn't the restriction of the middle homeomorphism $h$ not be ? But this proof does not seem to use domain invariance, so I wonder if it's correct. As usual, there probably is a simple insight here that I am lacking, but I am not getting myself on the right track, so any hint appreciated. What I have seen looks like john's answer, but was really: Mand N are homeomorphic manifolds with dimensions m and n. Obtain a contradiction if m > n. $h:M\rightarrow N$ is a homeomorphism. for $h(x)  \in N$ there is an open V in N, an open $O_v$ in $R^n$ , and a homeomorphism $\psi_N :V\rightarrow O_v$ . $h^{-1}(V)$ is open in M, so there is an open $U\subset h^{-1}(V)$ around x, an open $0_u$ in $R^m$ and a homeomorphism $\psi_M : U \rightarrow O_u$ . Again, $h(U)\subset V $ is open, and the restriction $\psi_N|_{h(U)}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image $O_v'$ . My text says here that $\psi_M\ o\ h^{-1} \ o\ \psi_N|_{h(U)}^{-1}$ (edited: I should use $ \psi_N|_{h(U)} \ o\ h\ o\  \psi_M^{-1}$ ) is continuous and injective and uses domain invariance to conclude it is open. I fail to see why the restriction of h to U would not be a homeomorphism, and the composition is not just a composition of three homeomorphisms, which is open, or what else is the reason that domain invariance is used. The domain invariance proposition which is used is: any continuous injective function from an open $O\subset R^n$ into $R^n$ is open. PS: following freakish' hint, I think I found the answer that all the restrictions are indeed homeomorphisms, but it is not useful to know because I need an embedding into a higher dimension, and that is where I need Brouwer's domain invariance","[I put a PS at the bottom of the text, as I think problem's solved] There is a simple idea that a restriction of a homeomorphism to a subset of its domain yields a new homeomorphism onto its image.

As I understand it, symplectic reductions arose from the interest of taking quotients of symplectic manifolds under group actions and the Hamilton-Jacobi group action is the one that makes it possible (via the momentum map $\mu$ ) as it satisfies several requirements as the dimension and the symplectic structure of the manifold. In particular, the Mardsen-Weinstein-Meyer theorem states that the quotient $\mu^{-1}(0) / G$ is a symplectic manifold.

Let $X\xrightarrow{Q}Y$ be a smooth, surjective, local diffeomorphism between smooth manifolds. Let us also assume $Q$ is ""normal"" in that its group of deck transformations acts transitively on each fiber. We say $s \in T^n(X)$ is "" $Q$ -invariant"" if $s$ is invariant under all deck transformations of $Q$ . Denote by $\text{inv}_{Q}T^n(X)$ the space of $Q$ -invariant covariant rank- $n$ tensors on $X$ .

For $\omega \in \text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^n(X)$ we have $d\omega \in \text{inv}_{Q}\Omega^{n+1}(X)$ and $Q^{n+1}_!(d\omega) = d(Q_!^n \omega)$ .

My 1st question is whether the above is valid and makes sense? My 2nd question is whether the last condition above is satisfied, and how to show this? I.e., for every closed $n$ -form $\omega$ on $X$ , is there an $Q$ -invariant (i.e. invariant under deck transformations of $Q$ ) closed $n$ -form $\omega'$ on $X$ , which is cohomologous with $\omega$ (i.e. their difference is exact)? Or (more weakly?) can we show the inclusion of the $Q$ -invariant de Rham complex into $X$ 's full de Rham complex is a quasi-isomorphism (induces isomorphisms on all cohomology groups)? Update : Here is my thinking thus far on the 2nd question: Let us further assume: that the group $G$ of deck transformations is a topological group, acting continuously on $X$ , and it admits a Haar measure $\mu$ with finite total volume; and that each $g \in G$ induces the identity (not just an isomorphism) on the de Rham cohomology of $X$ .

Here $|G| = \mu(G)$ is the finite volume of $G$ . Furthermore, since for each $g\in G$ we know $g^*$ induces the identity on $H^n_{\mathrm{dR}}(X)$ it follows that $\omega$ is cohomologous with $g^*\omega$ , so also $\omega = \frac{1}{|G|}\int_{g\in G}\omega\,d\mu(g)$ is cohomologous with $\omega' = \frac{1}{|G|}\int_{g\in G} (g^*\omega)\,d\mu(g)$ .

Remark: I thought doing in many posts as part 1, and so on, but I think it will lose the idea. However, if some moderator thinks that will be better I will do it :D. To proof that, he gives a definition and a lemma, Definition A map $f: I\to M$ is a parametrization by arc-length if $f$ maps $I$ diffeomorphically onto an open subset $\dagger$ of $M$ , and if the ""velocity vector"" $d f_s(1) \quad\varepsilon\quad T M_{f(s)}$ has unit length, for each $s \varepsilon I$ . Any given local parametrization $I^\prime\to M$ can be transformed into a parametrization by arc-length by a straightforward change of variables. Lemma Let $f: I\to M$ and $g: J\to M$ be parametrizations by arc-length. Then $f(I) \cap g(J)$ has at most two components. If it has only one component, then $f$ can be extended to a parametrization by arc-length of the union $f(I) \cup g(J)$ . If it has two components, then M must be diffeomorphic to $S^1$ . Here is the beginning of the proof Proof Clearly $g^{-1}$ of maps some relatively open subset of $I$ diffeomorphically onto a relatively open subset of $J$ . Furthermore the derivative of $g^{-1}$ of is equal to $\pm 1$ everywhere. My doubts are: To prove that let $U=f(I)\cap g(J)$ , so $$h:=g^{-1}\circ f:f^{-1}(U)\to g^{-1}(U)$$ that ""open subset of $I$ "" is $f^{-1}(U)$ so $h$ is a diffeormophism. From there $h(s)=g^{-1}\circ f(s)$ , then $dh_s=dg^{-1}_{f(s)}(df_s)$ . I know that $\|df_s(1)\|=\|dg_t(1)\|=1$ , and $dg^{-1}_t=(dg_{g^{-1}(t)})^{-1}$ , so $$\begin{aligned}\|dh_s(1)\|&=\|dg^{-1}_{f(s)}(df_s(1))\|\\&=\|(dg_{g^{-1}(f(s))})^{-1}(df_s(1))\|\\&=\|(dg_{h(s)})^{-1}(df_s(1))\|\end{aligned}$$ (1) But I don't know what to do from that.

11,Understanding the use of compactness in getting a variation of an admissible curve from a vector field,Understanding the use of compactness in getting a variation of an admissible curve from a vector field,,"I came across the following result in the book ""Riemannian Manifolds: An Introduction to Curvature"" by John Lee. Theorem: Let $\gamma: \left[ a, b \right] \rightarrow M$ be an admissible curve and $V$ be a vector field along $\gamma$ . Then, $V$ is the variation field of some variation of $\gamma$ . Moreover, if $V$ is proper then the variation can be chosen to be proper. The proof of this result uses the fact that $\left[ a, b \right]$ is compact. Particularly, this is used to define the variation of $\gamma$ as $\Gamma \left( s, t \right) = \exp \left( s V(t) \right)$ . I am  not sure if I understand this properly. Here are my thoughts on how it is used. We know that $\exp$ is defined on an open set containing the zero section. That is, there is an open set $\mathscr{E} \subseteq TM$ (the tangent bundle) such that for all $p \in M$ , $\left( p, 0 \right) \in \mathscr{E}$ . Therefore, for each $p \in M$ , there are balls $B^{\left( p \right)} \left( 0, \delta_p \right) \subseteq \mathscr{E} \cap T_pM$ . Now, we see that $V(t) \in \frac{2 \| V(t) \|}{\delta_p} B \left( 0, \delta_p \right)$ so that these (scaled) balls form an open cover for $V \left( \left[ a, b \right] \right)$ (am I right here?). Once this is done, we get a finite subcover and hence there is some $\epsilon > 0$ such that for $\left| s \right| < \epsilon$ , we have $s V(t) \in \mathscr{E} \cap T_{\gamma \left( t \right)} M$ . Is this reasoning correct? It seems to me that there will be some disjoint unions involved and we may not be able to use the scaled balls to conclude what we want.

12,"For a Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold, is the log of the transition probability proportional to the squared geodesic distance?","For a Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold, is the log of the transition probability proportional to the squared geodesic distance?",,"I am trying to gather some intuition on the connection on diffusion processes and Riemannian geometry, with only very limited knowledge of the latter. First, let us consider a Brownian Motion in euclidean space. For $\Sigma$ a positive definite matrix, $W_t$ standard $n-$ dimensional brownian motion, $X_t$ solving the stochastic differential equation $$ d X_t = \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}} d W_t$$ we have that the density $p(x,y,t)$ for $X_t$ starting at $y$ solves the Fokker-Planck equation $$ \frac{d}{dt} p = \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} p$$ where we use Einstein summing convention. The density is given by $p(x,y,t) \propto \exp \left(\frac{-(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1}(x-y)^T} {2t}\right)$ (where the proportionality is since we still require normalization). Now some geometry: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold (we assume compactness and everything else we might need for the definitions to work). The gradient $\operatorname{grad}$ is defined implicitly by obeying the relation $\langle \operatorname{grad} f, X \rangle_g = d f(X)$ for any vector vield $X$ . The adjoint of the gradient is the divergence $\operatorname{div}$ . One then has the Laplace-Beltrami-operator on the manifold given by $$\Delta_M = \operatorname{div}\operatorname{grad}.$$ One can explicitly write the Laplace-Beltrami operator as $$\Delta_M f = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det g}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\sqrt{\det g} g^{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} f)$$ where $g^{ij}$ refers to the inverse of the metric tensor. We now see that our Fokker-Planck equation includes a special case of the Laplace-Beltrami-Operator, where the manifold is just euclidean space and the metric is the constant $\Sigma^{-1}$ . Indeed, in these notes the definition of a Brownian motion on a manifold is taken to be the process which has density $p(x,y,t)$ , where $p$ is the minimal, positive solution to $$\frac{d}{dt}p =  \frac{1}{2} \Delta_M  p, \  p(x,y,0) = \delta_y(x).$$ Now on our manifold, we have the notion of a geodesic distance, which is given by $$ d_M(x,y) = \inf \{ L(\gamma) | \gamma \text{ a piecewise continuos curve from } x \text{ to } y\}.$$ In our standard euclidean case this is just a straight line. In particular, the geodesic distance on $E = (\mathbb{R}^n,\Sigma^{-1})$ should be given by $$d_E(x,y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-y)}.$$ Now by comparison with our density for the Brownian motion, we see that $$\ln p(x,y,t) \propto - d_E(x,y)^2.$$ This makes of course intuitively sense to be the generalization of the isotropic case: Diffusion is characterized by equiprobable motion in all directions, so by introducing a different covariane matrix of diffusion tensor we assume that we are in a space with some different metric, but still the transition probability only depends on this metric. My question is now, whether this property generalizes to the definition of Brownian motion on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds above. That is, do we have that $$\ln p(x,y,t) \propto - d_M(x,y)^2$$ on a general Riemannian manifold $M$ ? Intuitively, this should hold. Unfortunately, Im not familiar enough with differential geometry to prove this. What might be useful is that geodesics should fulfill the 'geodesic equation' in local coordinates $$\frac{\partial x_k} {\partial t^2} = -\Gamma^{k}_{ij} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial t}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial t} $$ with $\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$ the Christoffel symbol of the second kind. This also somewhat appears in the equation for the Laplace-Beltrami operator since $$ \Gamma^i_{ij} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det g}} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\sqrt{\det g})$$ but I don't know if this helps.

Definitions/what I know: There exists a parametrization $\mathbf {X}(x^1,x^2)$ of the surface $\mathcal S$ (with local coordinates $x^1, x^2$ ), which defines two tangent vectors to each point on the surface $\mathbf e_i = \frac{\partial \mathbf X}{\partial x^I} = \partial_i \mathbf X$ (basis vectors, orthogonal but not necessarily orthonormal).

This is obtained by ""several times applying the Gauss-Weingarten relations"": $\partial_i\mathbf e_j = -C_{ij} \mathbf n + \Gamma_{ij}^k \mathbf e_k$ and $\partial_i \mathbf n = C_i^j \mathbf e_j$ .

Show that the projection map  is a surjective smooth submersion.,E M \pi :E \to M,Suppose $E$ is a smooth vector bundle over $M$ . Show that the projection map $\pi :E \to M$ is a surjective smooth submersion. Since $E$ is a smooth vector bundle for each $p \in M$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $\varphi: \pi^{-1}(U) \to U \times \Bbb R^k$ is a diffeomorphism and that $\pi_1 \circ \varphi = \pi$ . In order for $\pi$ to be a smooth submersion the differential $d\pi_p : T_p E \to T_{\pi(p)} M$ must be surjective. Since we have the characterization $\pi_1 \circ \varphi = \pi$ we get that $$d\pi_{p} = d(\pi_1 \circ \varphi)_p = d\pi_{1_{\varphi(p)}} \circ d\varphi_{p}.$$ Now I need to show that $d\pi_{1_{\varphi(p)}}$ and $d\varphi_{p}$ surjective maps in order to conclude the proof. Since $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism we have that $\varphi^{-1}$ is a smooth bijection. So defining $d\varphi^{-1}_{q} : T_{q}(U \times \Bbb R^k) \to T_p \pi^{-1}(U)$ we have that $$d\varphi_p \circ d\varphi^{-1}_{q} = d(\varphi \circ \varphi^{-1})_{q} = d(id)_{q}$$ so $d\varphi^{-1}_{\varphi(p)}$ is an inverse for $d\varphi_p$ and so it's bijective and in particular surjective. Similarly for $d\pi_{1_p}:T_p(U \times \Bbb R^k) \to T_{\pi_1(p)}U$ define $d\iota_{U_q} : T_qU \to T_{\iota_U(q)}(U \times \Bbb R^k)$ where $\iota_U:U \to U \times \Bbb R^k$ is the right inverse of $\pi_1$ . Then we get that $$d\pi_{1_p} \circ d\iota_{U_q} = d(\pi_1 \circ \iota_U)_q=d(id)_q$$ which by same reasoning makes $d\pi_1$ surjective.

54,Generators of $H^1_{dR}(S^1)$ and angular forms,Generators of  and angular forms,H^1_{dR}(S^1),"I am trying to understand and ""visualize"" the generator of the first de Rham cohomology group of the circle and the intuition behind the concept of angular form. $H^1(S^1)$ can be computed from Mayer-Vietoris sequence obtaining $\dim H^1(S^1)= 1$ and from the coboundary map we obtain a generator $\omega_{MV}$ of $H^1(S^1)$ as a bump form with support (in a connected component of) the intersection of the two open sets used in M-V, that is, a bump form on the circle (say with integral equal to 1). Thus $H^1(S^1) = \langle [\omega_{MV}] \rangle$ . This form is sometimes called ""angular form"" but intuitively does not look like a ""differential"" of an angle (I know that the angle is a multifunction and hence we should use the universal cover of $S^1$ to properly discuss it, but we can get away with some careful intuition nonetheless). Intuitively the angle ""function"" has a linear growth on the circle minus a point, thus I'd expect its ""differential"" to be a ""constant"" form. Of course constant does not make sense for a 1-form. We can restate this by asking that this angular form should evaluate to a constant function when paired with the vector field $X = x \frac{\partial}{\partial y} - y \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ restricted to $S^1$ . Of course such a form can be seen as the restriction of $xdy - ydx$ to $S^1$ . Without referring to the ambient space, we can construct a ""constant"" form $\omega_c$ gluing the forms $c\cdot dx$ on $U,V \simeq \mathbb{R}$ as follows. Say $U \simeq_{\varphi_U} (0-\varepsilon,\pi +\varepsilon)$ and $V \simeq_{\varphi_V} (\pi-\varepsilon,2\pi +\varepsilon)$ just to fix the ideas. We have $$\varphi_U(U\cap V) = (0- \varepsilon,0+\varepsilon) \sqcup (\pi -\varepsilon,\pi+\varepsilon)$$ $$\varphi_V(U\cap V) = (2\pi- \varepsilon,2\pi +\varepsilon) \sqcup (\pi -\varepsilon,\pi+\varepsilon)$$ and the transition functions are the identity on the first compoment and the translation $\pm 2\pi$ on the second component, thus their jacobian is always the identity. Moreover on $\mathbb{R}$ the forms $dx$ are translation invariant, i.e. $dx_p = dx_{p+q}$ , thus in the end $\varphi_{UV}^*dx = dx$ . This defines $\omega_c$ as $\omega_c|_U = c \cdot \varphi_U^*dx$ and $\omega_c|_V = c \cdot \varphi_U^*dx$ . These forms are closed by definition and they are intuitively exact since if there was a function on $S^1$ with a constant differential, it must be constantly increasing, but this is impossible on $S^1$ . Thus $H^1(S^1) = \langle [\omega_{c}] \rangle$ . This form is what I would call angular form , of course, since $H^1$ is 1-dimensional, $[\omega_{c}] = [\omega_{MV}]$ thus by extension we call also $\omega_{MV}$ an angular form. Since $S^1$ is compact, we also have $H_c^1(S^1) = \langle [\omega_{c}] \rangle = \langle [\omega_{MV}] \rangle$ . Does my reasoning make sense? Thanks EDIT: I've rewritten the construction of ""constant"" 1-forms to make it clearer.

A $q$ -dimensional smooth manifold $T_{0}$ . For each $U_{i} \in \mathcal{U}$ a submersion $f_{i}: U_{i} \rightarrow T_{0}$ with connected fibers (these fibers are called plaques). For all intersections $U_{i} \cap U_{j} \neq \emptyset$ a local diffeomorphism $\gamma_{i j}$ of $T_{0}$ such that $f_{j}=\gamma_{i j} \circ f_{i}.$ We call $T=\coprod_{U_{i} \in \mathcal{U}} f_{i}\left(U_{i}\right)$ the transverse manifold of $\mathcal{F} .$ The local diffeomorphisms $\gamma_{i j}$ generate a pseudogroup $\Gamma$ of transformations on $T$ (called the holonomy pseudogroup ). The space of leaves $M / \mathcal{F}$ of the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ can be identified with $T / \Gamma$ . Also, for a transversal section $S$ at $x\in L$ one obtains the map $$ \mathrm{hol}^{S}=\mathrm{hol}^{S, S}: \pi_{1}(L, x) \longrightarrow \operatorname{Diff}_{x}(S) $$ which is a group homomorphism to obtain a homomorphism of groups hol: $\pi_{1}(L, x) \longrightarrow \operatorname{Diff}_{0}\left(\mathbb{R}^{q}\right)$ which is called the holonomy homomorphism of $L$ , and is determined uniquely up to a coniugation in $\operatorname{Diff}_{0}\left(\mathbb{R}^{q}\right)$ .

Definition of submanifold Let $M$ be an n-manifold and $S$ a subspace of $M$ . $S$ is said a submanifold of dimension $d$ of $M$ is for every point $p$ of $M$ , there is a chart $(U,x)$ of $M$ such that $x(U\cap S)=x(U)\cap (\mathbb{R}^d\times \{0\}^{n-d})$ . In other words, if the points $q$ that fall in $U$ are characterized of the $n-d$ equations $x^{d+1},...,x^{n}(q)=0$ . Such a chart is called a privileged chart(with respect to S) and determins a chart $(U \cap S,x_{U \cap S})$ , called submanifold chart (if we identify $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{0\}^{n-d}$ ) If $(U,x), (V,y)$ are privileged charts, we have that $x(U\cap V \cap S)$ is an open set in $x(U\cap S)$ and so in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $y_{V\cap S} \circ (x_{U\cap S})^{-1}=(y\circ x^{-1})_{x(U \cap V \cap S)}: x(U \cap V \cap S) \to y(U \cap V \cap S)$ is differentiable, so that the submanifold charts form an atlas and determine a d-dimensional differential structure over $S$ . With this structure, $S$ is a d-manifold. A d-submanifold is always thought of with this canonical or natural submanifold structure Proposition: Each chart of the canonical structure of a submanifold S is locally a submanifold chart. Proof. Let $p$ be a point in the domain of the chart $(V,y)$ of $S$ . By definition, ...(1) there exists a privileged chart $(U,x)$ of $M$ at $p$ that we can supposed such that $U \cap S \subset V$ and $ x(U)=A \times B$ with $A$ an open set at $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and B an open set at $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n-d}$ ...(2) By means of the chart $x$ , the canonical projection $\sigma : A\times B \to A\times \{0\}$ induces a sort of projection $\pi = x^{-1} \circ \sigma \circ x :U \to U \cap S$ which is differentiable ...(3) Thus we have that $(U,z)$ with $z=(y^1\circ \pi, ...,y^d\circ \pi,x^{d+1},...,x^n)$ with values in $y(U\cap S)\times B$ is a privileged chart and $z|_{U\cap S}=y|_{U\cap S}$ ...(4) My questions are: 1 They start using a definition of what?. If it is the definition of a d-submanifold,as I would expect, why aren't they using the definition above, that is $x(U\cap S)=x(U)\cap (\mathbb{R}^d\times \{0\}^{n-d})$ )? 2 Why can we suppose $U \cap S \subset V$ and why do we need that? and why do we take opens sets at $0$ necessarily ?) 3 Why is $\pi = x^{-1} \circ \sigma \circ x$ differentiable?

72,The dimension of a tangent space of a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold is actually $k$,The dimension of a tangent space of a smooth -dimensional manifold is actually,k k,"From Ted Shifrin's comment "" We only need to restrict attention to a small neighborhood of $\phi(x)$ to apply the chain rule at a single point "" in his answer, I'm trying to formalize it to make things clear. Could you have a check on my proof? First, I recall related definitions to remove ambiguity. A subset $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is  called a smooth $n$ -dimensional manifold if $\forall x \in X$ , $\exists$ a diffeomorphism $\varphi: U \to V$ such that $V$ is open in $X$ , $U$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ , and $x \in V$ . Then $\varphi$ is called a local parameterization of $V$ . The inverse $\varphi^{-1}$ is called a local coordinate system , or chart , on $V$ . Let $X \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be a smooth $n$ -dimensional manifold and $x \in X$ . Let $\varphi: U \to V$ be a local parameterization around $x \in V$ . The continuous linear map $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^N$ is the Fréchet derivative of $\varphi$ at $\varphi^{-1}(x) \in U$ . The tangent space of $X$ at $x$ , denoted by $T_xX$ , is defined as the image of $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}$ , i.e., $$T_xX := \operatorname{im} \left (\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} \right ).$$ Theorem: Let $X \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be a $k$ -dimensional smooth manifold and $x \in X$ . Then the tangent space $T_xX$ is a vector space of dimension $k$ . Proof: Let $\varphi:U \to V$ be a local parameterization around $x$ . Here $U$ and $V$ are open in $\mathbb R^k$ and $X$ respectively. Also, $x \in V$ . Let $\varphi^{-1}$ be the inverse of $\varphi$ and $y := \varphi^{-1} (x) \in U$ . Let $\phi : V' \to \mathbb R^k$ be a differentiable extension of $\varphi^{-1}$ around $x$ . Here $V'$ is open in $\mathbb R^N$ and $x \in V'$ . Also, $\phi$ and $\varphi^{-1}$ agree on $V' \cap V$ . There exist $r_1, r_2>0$ such that $\mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1) \subseteq V'$ and $\mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_2) \subseteq U$ . Thanks to the differentiability and thus the continuity of $\varphi$ , there exists $r_3 > 0$ such that $z \in \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_3) \implies \varphi(z) \in \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1)$ . Let $r_4 := \min\{r_2, r_3\}$ and $U' := \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^k}(y, r_4)$ . Notice that $U'$ is open in $\mathbb R^k$ and $y \in U'$ . Also, $$\operatorname{im} ( \varphi_{\restriction U'} ) \subseteq \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^N}(x, r_1) \subseteq V' = \operatorname{dom} \phi.$$ Then the map $\Psi := \phi \circ \varphi_{\restriction U'}$ is well-defined and differentiable at $y$ . Moreover, $\Psi$ is the identity map on $U'$ , so $\mathrm d\Psi_y$ is the identity map on $\mathbb R^k$ . By chain rule, $$\mathrm d\Psi_y = \mathrm d \phi_{\varphi (y)} \circ \mathrm d\varphi_{y}.$$ This means $\mathrm d \phi_{\varphi (y)}$ is surjective, while $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)} = \mathrm d\varphi_{y}$ is injective. Hence $\mathrm d \varphi_{\varphi^{-1}(x)}$ is indeed an isomorphism between $\mathbb R^k$ and the tangent space $T_xX$ . This completes the proof. Update: Writing down the details reveals why we can not apply the same strategy to show $N=k$ (which is indeed not correct!). To succeed, we want to find an open neighborhood $A$ of $x$ in $V'$ such that $\Phi := \varphi \circ \phi_{\restriction A} = \operatorname{id}_{A}$ . However, the only thing we know is $\varphi \circ \phi_{\restriction A \cap V} = \operatorname{id}_{A \cap V}$ . This is because we have no information/restriction on the behavior of $\phi$ on $A \cap V^c$ . Let $A \subseteq \mathbb R^m$ , $B \subseteq C \subseteq \mathbb R^n$ , and $D \subseteq \mathbb R^p$ . Let $f:A \to B$ and $g:C \to D$ be differentiable/smooth in this sense . With the same technique of restriction, we can show that $h := g \circ f:A \to D$ is also differentiable/smooth. Fix $x \in A$ and let $y:=f(x)$ . Then there is a differentiable extension $\varphi:U \to \mathbb R^n$ of $f$ around $x$ . Here $x\in U$ , $U$ is open in $\mathbb R^m$ , and $\varphi$ agrees with $f$ on $A \cap U$ . Similarly,  there is a differentiable extension $\phi:V \to \mathbb R^p$ of $g$ around $y$ . Here $y \in V$ , $V$ is open in $\mathbb R^n$ , and $\phi$ agrees with $g$ on $C \cap V$ . There exists $r>0$ such that $U' := \mathbb B_{\mathbb R^m}(x, r) \subseteq U$ and $x \in U'\implies \varphi(x) \in V$ .

73,How to prove that a surface whose normal lines intersect a given line is a portion of a surface of revolution,How to prove that a surface whose normal lines intersect a given line is a portion of a surface of revolution,,"I'm stuck on Exercise 3.70 from Kristopher Tapp's Differential Topology of Curves and Surfaces : Let $S$ be a connected oriented regular surface. Suppose there exists a line $L \subset \mathbb R^3$ that intersects all normal lines to $S$ (that is, for every $p \in S$ , the trace of the normal line $t \mapsto p + t N(p)$ intersects $L$ ). Prove that $S$ is a portion of a surface of revolution. I was able to show that every point $p \in S$ has a neighbourhood in $S$ whose intersection with the plane perpendicular to $L$ through $p$ is a circle with centre on $L$ (with the help of part (i) in this question: How to solve this questions about regular surfaces? ): Note that we further require $L$ not to intersect $S$ . First, suppose $L$ is the $z$ -axis and let $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3) \in S$ . Then $p + s N(p) = (0, 0, z)$ for some $s \in \mathbb R - \{0\}$ and some $z \in \mathbb R$ , so $N(p) = (-p_1 / s, -p_2 / s, (z - p_3) / s)$ . Note that $\langle(-p_1 / s, -p_2 / s, 0), N(p)\rangle = (p_1^2 + p_2^2) / s^2 \neq 0$ , so $(-p_1 / s, -p_2 / s, 0) \notin T_pS$ . Thus, either $e_1 \notin T_pS$ or $e_2 \notin T_pS$ , and so by Exercise 3.48, there is a neighbourhood $V$ of $p$ in $S$ that is the graph of a smooth function of one of the following forms: $x = f(y, z)$ , or $y = f(x, z)$ , respectively. Define the curve $\gamma: I \to V$ by $\gamma(t) = (f(t, p_3), t, p_3)$ or $\gamma(t) = (t, f(t, p_3), p_3)$ , respectively. Then $\gamma'(t) = (df_{(t, p_3)}(1, 0), 1, 0) \neq 0$ or $\gamma'(t) = (1, df_{(t, p_3)}(1, 0), 0) \neq 0$ , and $\gamma(I) \subset p + \operatorname{span}\{e_1, e_2\}$ . Conversely, if $(x, y, p_3) \in V$ , then $x = f(y, p_3)$ or $y = f(x, p_3)$ , and so $V \cap (p + \operatorname{span}\{e_1, e_2\}) \subset \gamma(I)$ . We claim $\gamma$ is a portion of the circle centred at $(0, 0, p_3)$ through $p$ . For each $t \in I$ , let $\mathfrak n(t)$ denote the projection of $N(\gamma(t))$ onto $\operatorname{span}\{e_1, e_2\}$ . Then $$\langle\mathfrak n(t), \gamma'(t)\rangle = \langle N(\gamma(t)), \gamma'(t)\rangle - \langle N(\gamma(t)), e_3\rangle \langle e_3, \gamma'(t)\rangle = 0$$ and $\gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3) = -\frac{\lvert\gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3)\rvert}{\lvert\mathfrak n(t)\rvert} \mathfrak n(t)$ for all $t \in I$ . Thus, $$\frac{d}{dt}\langle\gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3), \gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3)\rangle = -\frac{2 \lvert\gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3)\rvert}{\lvert\mathfrak n(t)\rvert} \langle\gamma'(t), \mathfrak n(t)\rangle = 0,$$ and so $\lvert\gamma(t) - (0, 0, p_3)\rvert$ is constant. What I'm having trouble showing is that there's a single curve whose surface of revolution about the line $L$ contains $S$ , i.e. that if two points of the surface are in the same plane perpendicular to $L$ , then they're at the same distance from $L$ (the question Surfaces of revolution - Problem does not address this); I'm pretty sure I need to use the fact that $S$ is connected, and hence path connected (I'm pretty sure I can show it is in fact smoothly path connected, if needed), but I can't seem to use a path between two points to obtain the single curve I need. Given two points $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3), q = (q_1, q_2, q_3) \in S$ with $p_3 = q_3$ (still assuming $L$ is the $z$ -axis), I believe I want to show that $p_1^2 + p_2^2 = q_1^2 + q_2^2$ , or perhaps find a way to write $p_1^2 + p_2^2$ as a function of $p_3$ . I've tried using the fact that there are functions $s: S \to \mathbb R - \{0\}, z: S \to \mathbb R$ such that $p + s(p) N(p) = (0, 0, z(p))$ and manipulating this equation to do the latter, and I've tried introducing a path (or curve, if needed) $\beta: [0, 1] \to S$ from $p$ to $q$ and using the fact that $\beta'(t) \in T_{\beta(t)}S$ to do the former, but haven't found anything that I can tell is useful. Another thing I've thought to try after the discussion in the comments is to show that if there are points $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3), q = (q_1, q_2, q_3) \in S$ with $p_3 = q_3$ at different distances from the $z$ -axis, then there is a point $\beta(t)$ on the curve from $p$ to $q$ (which would need to be regular, which I think I could guarantee by taking a piecewise-regular path and rounding off the corners in a neighbourhood thereof) with $\beta'(t)$ horizontal such that $T_{\beta(t)}S$ is horizontal, but I don't really see how to show this. By the first part of the proof, I know that one basis vector in $T_{\beta(t)}S$ is the tangent vector to the horizontal circle through $\beta(t)$ , and presumably I need to somehow use the fact that $p, q$ are at different distances from the $z$ -axis to show that $\beta'(t)$ is linearly independent of that vector, but I don't see how.","I'm stuck on Exercise 3.70 from Kristopher Tapp's Differential Topology of Curves and Surfaces : Let be a connected oriented regular surface.

A Riemannian metric $g$ is Hermitian if for any $X,Y \in T_p\mathcal{M}$ , $p\in \mathcal{M}$ , we have $g(J(X),J(Y)) = g(X, Y) $ . We assume that the almost complex structure acts as $J\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}$ , $J\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\mu}}\right) = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}$ , so that $ J\left(\dfrac{\partial }{\partial z^{\mu}} \right) = i \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z^{\mu}} \,,\quad J\left(\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}^{\mu}}\right) = -i \dfrac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}^{\mu}} $ The above condition then forces $g_{\mu \nu} = g_{\bar{\mu}\bar{\nu}} = 0$ . Looking at the metric expansion, we see that this means $g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} = g_{\mu \nu}^{(4)}$ , while $g_{\mu \nu}^{(2)} = - g_{\mu \nu}^{(3)}$ , in this basis. Using these results, we find that \begin{eqnarray} G_{MN} \, dX^M \otimes dX^N &=& \frac{1}{4}\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} + g_{\mu \nu}^{(4)} + i\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(2)} - g_{\mu \nu}^{(3)} \right)\right) dz^{\mu} \otimes d\bar{z}^{\nu} \\ && + \frac{1}{4}\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} + g_{\mu \nu}^{(4)} - i\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(2)} - g_{\mu \nu}^{(3)} \right)\right) d\bar{z}^{\mu} \otimes dz^{\nu} % \\ % &=& \frac{1}{2}\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} + ig_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}\right) dz^{\mu} \otimes d\bar{z}^{\nu} + \frac{1}{2}\left(g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} - ig_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}\right) d\bar{z}^{\mu} \otimes dz^{\nu} % \\ % &=& \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}\, dz^{\mu} \otimes d\bar{z}^{\nu} + h_{\bar{\nu} \mu} \, d\bar{z}^{\nu} \otimes dz^{\mu} \right) \end{eqnarray} Where we call $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}} = \overline{h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}}$ the Hermitian metric on $\mathcal{M}$ . QUESTION Is the above relationship between $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}$ and $G_{MN}$ correct, and why is it that $\det(G_{MN}) = (\det(h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}))^2$ ? Here is an attempt at an answer. Let $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ be $n \times n$ matrices. Then if $C$ , $D$ commute , we have the identity \begin{equation} \label{det:identity} \det \begin{pmatrix}     A & B \\     C & D \end{pmatrix} = \det(AD - BC) \end{equation} Using the decomposition of $G_{MN}$ , we find that \begin{eqnarray} \label{det-G} \det\left(G_{MN}\right) &=& \det\left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)}g_{\nu\lambda}^{(4)} - g_{\mu\nu}^{2}g_{\nu\lambda}^{3}\right) = \det\left( \left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)}\right)^2 + \left(g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right)^2\right) \\ &=& \det\left( g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)} + i g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right) \det\left( g_{\mu\nu}^{(1)} - i g_{\mu\nu}^{(2)}\right) \end{eqnarray} The second equality above comes from the identifications due to hermitian condition described above. The RHS of the last equation is $\det\left(h_{\mu\bar{\nu}}\right) \det\left(h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}\right)$ and we have seen that $h_{\bar{\nu}\mu}=\overline{h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}}$ . So we find that $$ \det\left(G_{MN}\right) = \left|\det\left(h_{\mu\bar{\nu}}\right)\right|^2 $$ or $\det\left(h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}\right) = \sqrt{\det\left(G_{MN}\right)}$ if $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}}$ is real. Problems: $g^{(2)}$ , $g^{(3)}$ do not necessarily commute. But perhaps it is true that these components are somehow required to vanish -- maybe due to the requirement that $\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y^{\nu}} \}$ form an /orthonormal basis/ -- so that $h_{\mu \bar{\nu}} = g_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}$ .","I am trying to explicitly find the relationship between a Hermitian metric on a complex manifold and the Riemannian metric on the underlying real manifold -- and specifically on how the determinants of both are related.

Following Lee's book on Riemannian manifolds, we define the $(1,3)$ -curvature tensor $R:\mathfrak{X}(M)\times\mathfrak{X}(M)\times\mathfrak{X}(M)\to\mathfrak{X}(M)$ by $$R(X,Y)Z=\nabla_X\nabla_Y Z-\nabla_Y\nabla_X Z-\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z.$$ The definition of $R$ is as simple as it appears, before we introduce vector fields along a one-parameter family of curves. Let $I,J$ be intervals in the real line. A one-parameter family of curves in $M$ is a map $\Gamma:J\times I\to M$ , since it defines two collections of curves in $M$ : the main curves $\Gamma_s(t):=\Gamma(s,t)$ and the transverse curves $\Gamma^{(t)}(s):=\Gamma(s,t)$ . If $\Gamma$ is smooth, we denote the velocity vectors of the main and transverse curves by $$\partial_t\Gamma(s_0,t_0)=\Gamma_{s_0}'(t_0)\text{ and }\partial_s\Gamma(s_0,t_0)=\Gamma^{(t_0)}\ '(s_0).$$ Each of these is an example of a vector field along $\Gamma$ , which is a map $V:J\times I\to TM$ such that $V(s,t)\in T_{\Gamma(s,t)}M$ for each $(s,t)\in J\times I$ . Now, there is a proposition that involves feeding $R$ with such vector fields. Proposition 7.5. Suppose $(M,g)$ is a smooth Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold and $\Gamma:J\times I\to M$ is a smooth one-parameter family of curves in $M$ . Then for every smooth vector field $V$ along $\Gamma$ , $$D_s D_t V-D_t D_s V=R(\partial_s\Gamma,\partial_t\Gamma)V.\tag{7.5}$$ I don't know what the RHS of (7.5) stands for: the input vector fields are not from $\mathfrak{X}(M)$ . What am I supposed to do with it? Thank you. Note: For those who deem this question to be a duplicate, I know $R$ is a tensor field. Actually, after giving the definition of $R$ , Lee showed in a proposition that $R$ is $C^\infty(M)$ -linear in each argument and is thus induced by a $(1,3)$ -tensor field. Epilogue: For those who are struggling with the same question, my advisor told me it could be an abuse of notation. The author might have been implicitly using the pullback bundle $\Gamma^*(TM)$ , a subtle agent that played an important role in the computation.

If yes, is the embedding also infiitesimally perturbed from the original one? (Of course an embedding may not be unique, I mean is there one embedding that is infinitesimally close?) b) If the answer to 'a' is affirmative, can I describe the embedding flow solely in terms of the extrinsic curvature? I have shown that except for manifolds with constant curvature ( $R_{\alpha\beta}=Cg_{\alpha\beta}$ ), the Ricci flow is different from the 'curve shortening flow' and therefore do not know where the animations of the ricci flow come from!","Consider a submanifold that is embedded in a higher dimensional manifold .

96,Can a parallel transported frame be obtained from the eigenvectors of a curvature tensor?,Can a parallel transported frame be obtained from the eigenvectors of a curvature tensor?,,"Let $(M,g,\nabla)$ be a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ and let $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\to M$ be a geodesic, namely, $\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\dot{\gamma}=0$ . It is well know that, given a basis $\{e_{j}(p)\}_{j=1}^{n}$ on the tangent space $T_{p}M$ , where $p=\gamma(0)$ , one can build a parallel transported frame $\{E_{0}(\gamma(t)):=\xi(\gamma(t)),E_{1}(\gamma(t)),\ldots,E_{n}(\gamma(t))\}$ on any tangent space $T_{\gamma(t)}M$ along the geodesic. In particular, this means that, for any $l$ , $\nabla_{\xi}E_{l}=0$ and $E_{l}(\gamma(0))\equiv e_{l}(p)$ . Now, setting $\xi:=\dot{\gamma}$ , let us introduce the symmetric endomorphism: $$ Ricc_{\xi}(p):=R(\xi(p),J(p))\xi(p),\qquad \forall J(p)\in T_{p}M $$ where $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor, i.e, $R(X,Y)Z|_{p}=R^{i}_{jkl}(p)X^{j}(p)X^{k}(p)Z^{l}(p)e_{i}(p)$ with $\{e_{i}(p)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is a orthonormal basis on the tangent space $T_{p}M$ . I know that $Ricc_{\xi}$ is symmetric because of the properties of the Riemann tensor, therefore, I can always diagonalized $Ricc_{\xi}$ on (in principle any tangent space) the initial point of the geodesic, that is, $p=\gamma(0)$ and I will get an eigensystem whose eigenvectors can be used as a basis on $T_{\gamma(0)}M$ . Now, supposing that I know the isomorphism (parallel transport map) $\Gamma_{t}:T_{p}M\to T_{\gamma(t)}M$ since I solved the geodesic equation, my question is: Can a parallel transported frame be obtained evolving the eigenvectors of the operator $Ricc_{\xi}$ through the map $\Gamma_{t}$ ?","Let be a Riemannian manifold of dimension and let be a geodesic, namely, .
