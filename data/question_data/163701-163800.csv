0,Are Radon measures on Polish spaces $\sigma$-finite?,Are Radon measures on Polish spaces -finite?,\sigma,"If $\Omega$ is a Polish space and $\mu$ is a Radon measure on $\Omega$ (i.e. an inner-regular Borel measure), is $\mu$ $\sigma$ -finite? I know that Radon measures in general need not be $\sigma$ -finite, and $\sigma$ -finite measures need not be Radon. The standard counterexample to the former is an uncountable set with the discrete topology and counting measure (which is Radon, but not $\sigma$ -finite), and one counterexample to the latter is $\Omega = \mathbb R$ with $\mu$ the counting measure on $\mathbb Q$ (which is $\sigma$ -finite, but not Radon, or even Borel). But what if $\Omega$ is Polish? If $Q \subset \Omega$ is countable and dense, since $\mu$ is Borel, every $q \in Q$ has an open neighborhood $U_q \ni q$ for which $\mu(U_q) < \infty$ . But a priori , there's no guarantee that $W:=\bigcup_{q \in Q} U_q = \Omega$ . We know that by density of $Q$ in $\Omega$ , we have that $W^c$ has empty interior, but $W^c$ could still have infinite measure in principle (e.g. let $\mu = \lambda^2 + \lambda^1$ on $\mathbb R^2$ , where $\lambda^2$ is the $2$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb R^2$ and $\lambda^1$ is the $1$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure on the $x$ -axis, and take $Q = \left\{(p,q) \in \mathbb Q^2 : p \neq 0\right\}$ ). And taking the closures $\overline U_q$ might not work because if $\Omega$ is an infinite-dimensional Banach space, for example, $\overline U_q$ need not be compact, so $\mu\left(\overline U_q\right) = \infty$ is possible. I'm really not sure one way or the other about the answer to this question. I can't think of a counterexample, but I can't think of a proof, either.
