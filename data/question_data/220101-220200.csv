5,Exercise II-3 from Eisenbud & Harris' The Geometry of Schemes,Exercise II-3 from Eisenbud & Harris' The Geometry of Schemes,,"I am having difficulty with the following exercise and would appreciate any help and explanations. Exercise II-3 on page 52 of The Geometry of Schemes by Eisenbud and Harris, but I give the setup first. The setup: We have $K$ -algebra inclusions $K[x,y] \hookrightarrow K[x,y]_{(x,y)} \hookrightarrow K[[x,y]]$ , where $K[x,y]$ is the commutative polynomial ring over $K$ in two variables, $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is the polynomial ring localised at the maximal ideal $(x,y)$ , and $K[[x,y]]$ the commutative formal power series ring in two variables. These maps induce maps on the spectra as follows: $$\operatorname{Spec}K[[x,y]]\to\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y]_{(x,y)}\to\operatorname{Spec}K[x,y].$$ Consider the prime ideal $(y^{2}-x^{3}-x^{2})$ of $K[x,y]$ . This is still prime in $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ . However, in $K[[x,y]]$ we now have $$y^{2}-x^{3}-x^{2}=(y-u)(y+u)$$ where $u=x+\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \frac{1}{16}x^4 - \cdots$ . Exercise II-3.

(b) Show that the image of the point $(y-\Sigma_{n\geq 1}\frac{x^n}{n!})$ of $\operatorname{Spec}K[[x,y]]$ is the generic point of $\mathbb{A}^2_K = \operatorname{Spec}K[x,y].$ My attempt for (a): $K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is local with unique maximal ideal $(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ and has Krull dimension $2 = \operatorname{ht}(x,y)$ . $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ is a prime ideal containing the prime ideal $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)$ , so we have the following chain of primes: $$(0)\subsetneq(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)\subseteq (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}\subseteq (x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}.$$ As this is happening in a ring of Krull dimension 2, this means we have only two options: either $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)= (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ or $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}= (x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ .

This would also yield $y= y-u+u= y-u +x+\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \frac{1}{8}x^3 + \frac{1}{16}x^4 - \cdots=y-u +x(1+\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2 + \frac{1}{16}x^3 - \cdots)\in (y-u).$ Therefore, we would have $(x,y)\subseteq (y-u)$ and hence $(x,y)=(y-u)$ as $(x,y)$ is maximal in $K[[x,y]].$ But $$ K[[x]] \cong K[[x,y]]/(y-u) = K[[x,y]]/(x,y) \cong K $$ yields a contradiction. Thus, $(y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)} \neq(x,y)K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ and so we must have $(y^2 -x^3 -x^2)= (y-u)\cap K[x,y]_{(x,y)}$ .

6,How does a complex algebraic variety know about its analytic topology?,How does a complex algebraic variety know about its analytic topology?,,"This question has two parts. The first is a reference request regarding a result I assume is standard, and the second is a soft question asking for philosophy and intuition about an issue the first question raises for me. Apologies in advance that it might be hard to answer completely. Nonetheless I expect and hope that both the question and any answers will be interesting and useful to denizens of the site. Part 1: the analytic topology is an isomorphism invariant, right? Let $V,W$ be affine algebraic sets (i.e. vanishing sets of ideals of polynomials) embedded in $\mathbb{C}^m,\mathbb{C}^n$ respectively, and suppose there exists an isomorphism $f:V\rightarrow W$ of algebraic varieties. If $V,W$ are equipped with their subspace topologies as subspaces of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{C}^m$ and $\mathbb{C}^n$ , is $f$ necessarily a homeomorphism? I assume that the answer is yes and that this is a standard fact, since it seems to me it should be necessary in order to define the analytic topology on a general complex analytic variety. (If the answer is not ""yes"", then ""the analytic topology"" is meaningless because it would depend on choices of coordinates.) On the other hand, it is not obvious to me, because the analytic/Euclidean topology on an algebraic subset of $\mathbb{C}^n$ is so much finer than its Zariski topology. How does knowing that $f$ is an algebraic isomorphism allow us to control all the extra data in the analytic topology? This last question suggests the broader inquiry of part 2 to me - Part 2: how does the algebraic variety know about its analytic topology? This is the soft question. If two complex algebraic sets can't be isomorphic as varieties without being homeomorphic as subsets of Euclidean space, this suggests that their structure as algebraic varieties ""knows something"" about this finer topology. In fact, the variety must in some sense ""know"" the entire analytic topology, as it can be recovered by embedding into affine space, endowing the latter with the Euclidean topology, and taking the subspace topology. Given this - Where in the data defining the variety (the Zariski topology + the structure sheaf) does the data defining the analytic topology hide? In other words, it must be that given a subset $U$ of a complex algebraic variety $V$ , one can test whether $U$ is open for the analytic topology using only the data contained in $V$ 's Zariski topology and structure sheaf - What is the test? Addendum 7/21: Hoot's comment and KReiser's answer have clarified for me an aspect of Part 2 that I would like to make explicit. As I insinuated at the beginning of part 2, although given a complex algebraic variety (i.e. scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$ ), one can recover the analytic topology by embedding its affines individually in complex affine space and taking the subspace topology, I am somehow unsatisfied by this as an explanation of how the variety knows about its analytic topology. Hoot's comment and KReiser's answer clarify for me why I am unsatisfied: what this is doing, philosophically, is using the sections of the structure sheaf to ""carry"" the analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}^n$ back to the variety, using the fact that the sections can be thought of as functions to $\mathbb{C}$ . The reason I wasn't satisfied with this (and hence asked the part 2 question) is that the analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}^n$ is data that lies outside the data that defines the variety. Hence, I would like to know if there is a way to test $U\subset V$ for analytic openness that can query any info contained in the data defining $V$ (its Zariski topology and structure sheaf, i.e. the $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra structure of its rings of sections and the restriction maps) but never queries whether or not a subset of any $\mathbb{C}^n$ is analytically open. Is there a test as above that does not consult the a-priori-known analytic topology on $\mathbb{C}$ ? Another way to sharpen the question: KReiser's answer shows that the reason that the analytic topology is an isomorphism invariant is essentially that polynomials are continuous. (KReisner noted even analyticity, so that an algebraic isomorphism is also an analytic isomorphism, but the only feature needed to conclude it's a homeomorphism is continuity.) Now any topology on $\mathbb{C}$ induces one on $\mathbb{C}^n$ , and we can ask with respect to any such topology whether polynomial functions $\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^m$ are continuous. If they are, the exact same proof shows that the given topology is an isomorphism invariant of affine complex algebraic varieties, and thus can be imposed in a well-defined way on an arbitrary variety. The Zariski and analytic topologies are two such topologies. The latter is a refinement of the former. Can we say anything about the family of topologies described in the last paragraph? How big is it? What do they have in common? Can any of them be recovered from the data defining the variety, without a priori knowledge of the topology?

The definition of an effective Cartier divisor in $X/S$ given in Katz-Mazur (what is called relative effective Cartier divisor in the Stacks Project) is: a closed subscheme $i:D\hookrightarrow X$ such that the ideal sheaf $I(D)$ is invertible and $f\circ i:D\rightarrow S$ is flat. I have two (possibly related questions). Question 1: Is the flatness of $f\circ i$ equivalent to flatness of the $\mathscr{O}_X$-module $i_*\mathscr{O}_D\cong\mathscr{O}_X/I(D)$ over $S$? I believe the answer to this question is yes, but only because $i$ is a closed immersion. Flatness of $f\circ i$ means the morphism $\mathscr{O}_{S,f(i(x))}\rightarrow\mathscr{O}_{D,x}$ is flat for all $x\in D$, while flatness of $i_*\mathscr{O}_D$ over $S$ means for each $x\in X$, $(i_*\mathscr{O}_D)_x$ is flat over $\mathscr{O}_{S,s}$ (or equivalently, $i_*\mathscr{O}_D$ is a flat $f^{-1}\mathscr{O}_S$-module). Because $i$ is a closed immersion, $(i_*\mathscr{O}_D)_x$ is either zero or $\mathscr{O}_{D,x}$ according as $x$ is or isn't in $D$. The equivalence of the two conditions follows from this. But surely for a general morphism $D\rightarrow X$ (not necessarily a closed immersion), flatness of $D$ over $S$ and flatness of $i_*\mathscr{O}_D$ over $S$ are different, right?

I don't see why this is. I can't even think of an algebraic fact to which it can be reduced. Maybe it helps to think of the quotient as $I(D)^{-1}/1_DI(D)^{-1}$, wher $1_D$ is the section defining the injection $\mathscr{O}_X\rightarrow I(D)^{-1}$. The reason I say ""implicitly"" above is because, while the claim in my second question is never made explicitly, after defining effective Cartier divisors and writing down the exact sequence above, KM considers pairs $(\mathscr{L},\ell)$ consisting of an invertible $\mathscr{O}_X$-module $\mathscr{L}$ and a regular section $\ell$ of $\mathscr{L}$, meaning the associated map $\mathscr{O}_X\rightarrow\mathscr{L}$ is injective, such that in the sequence \begin{equation*} 0\rightarrow\mathscr{O}_X\rightarrow\mathscr{L}\rightarrow\mathscr{L}/\mathscr{O}_X\rightarrow 0 \end{equation*} the quotient is $S$-flat.

How does the previous argument imply this conclusion?","Let $X\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ be an affine variety, let $I(X)=\{f\in k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]:f(P)=0,\ \forall P \in X\}$. We consider the ring $$A=k[a_1,\ldots,a_n]=\frac{k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]}{I(X)}$$ where $a_i=X_i \mod I(X)$. Noether normalization says that there are algebraically indipendent linear forms $y_1,\ldots,y_m$ in $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ such that $A$ is a finitely generated $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$-module. These linear forms lift to linear forms $\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m}$ in $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. Define $$\pi:=(\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m}):\mathbb{A}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{A}^m$$ and then restrict to $X$: $$\Phi:=\pi:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{A}^m$$ We want to show that $\Phi^{-1}(P)$ is finite and non-empty for every point $P\in\mathbb{A}^m$. Since $A$ is a f.g. $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$-module, then $A$ is integral over $k[y_1,\ldots,y_m]$, hence we have $$a_i^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_m)a_i^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(y_1,\ldots,y_m)=0$$ for every $i=1,\ldots,n$, or equivalently $$X_i^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m})X_i^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(\tilde{y_1},\ldots,\tilde{y_m})=g_i(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$$ for some $g_i\in I(X)$. If $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a point of $X$, the $g_i(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0$ thus $x_i$ is a solution of $f^i(x)=0$, where $$f^i(x)=x^{N}+f^i_{N-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_m)x^{N-1}+\ldots+f^i_0(y_1,\ldots,y_m)$$ Now, $X$ irreducible implies $I(X)$ prime and so $A$ is an integral domain.

Consider the category $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S}$ of schemes affine over $S$ , by which I mean $S$ -schemes $X$ such that the structure morphism $X \to S$ is affine. For simplicity, I'll also call those affine $S$ -schemes (though they don't have to be affine as an absolute scheme!). Consider the inclusion functor $\mathrm{Aff}_{/S} \to \mathrm{Sch}_{/S}$ . Does this have a left adjoint? The question is motivated by the ""absolute analogue"". It's well-known for $S=\mathrm{Spec}(\Bbb Z)$ that a left adjoint to $\mathrm{Aff} \to \mathrm{Sch}$ exists and it is given by $X \mapsto \mathrm{Spec}(\Gamma(X,\mathcal O_X))$ . The same construction works as long as $S$ is affine. One naïve way one might try to do a similar thing in the general setting is to use the relative Spec. The relative Spec construction has a nice universal property, so that seems promising. The idea is to define a functor $\mathrm{Sch}_{/S} \to \mathrm{Aff}_{/S}$ by sending $X \xrightarrow{f} S$ to $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}_S(f_* \mathcal O_X) \to S$ . The problem with this is that $\underline{\mathrm{Spec}}_S(f_* \mathcal O_X)$ is not even defined, because for general $f$ , there's no reason that $f_* \mathcal O_X$ is quasicoherent! (This is however true if $f$ is qcqs.) So that doesn't work. Of course, via the relative Spec functor, the category of affine $S$ -schemes is anti-equivalent to the category of quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebras, so the question could be recast in terms of asking for a functor from $S$ -schems to quasicoherent $\mathcal O_S$ -algebras with certain properties. Certainly taking the pushforward of the structure sheaf gives us a canonical $\mathcal O_S$ -algebra, that may however not be quasicoherent, as mentioned before.

42,Confusion about Notation for Twisting Sheaf and Very Ample Invertible Sheaves,Confusion about Notation for Twisting Sheaf and Very Ample Invertible Sheaves,,"I'm a bit confused by some notation in Hartshorne's chapter II (theorems II.5.17, II.7.6, and some discussion on ample invertible sheaves in section 7). Theorem 5.17 (Serre). Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a noetherian ring $A$ , let $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ , and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent $\mathcal{O}_X$ -module. Then there is an integer $n_0$ such that for all $n \geq n_0$ , the sheaf $\mathcal{F}(n)$ can be generated by a finite number of global sections. Proof. Let $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ be a closed immersion of $X$ into a projective space $A$ , such that $i^*(\mathcal{O}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ ... [The remainder of the paragraph is devoted to reducing to the case where $X$ is Proj of a polynomial ring.] First, what is meant by the hypothesis "" $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be a very ample invertible sheaf on $X$ "", since, a priori, $X$ is not projective space or Proj of a graded ring? I see that one can appeal to Corollary 5.16 to see that $X$ is $\mathrm{Proj}(S)$ for some graded ring $S$ , finitely generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0 = A$ -algebra. Then one can take $\mathcal{O}(1) = \widetilde{S(1)}$ . Then this is very ample since we can use the description of $S$ to construct a closed immersion $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^r$ with $i^*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_A^r}(1)) = \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ (by Proposition 5.12(c)), which is just $\mathcal{O}(1)$ . Is this the correct interpretation? Second, on p. 153, this result is later quoted as having established: for $\mathcal{L}$ any very ample invertible sheaf on a projective scheme $X$ over $A$ , for any coherent $\mathcal{F}$ , there is an $n_0$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{L}^n$ is generated by global sections, which appears slightly different than the above result, since we worked with the particular very ample invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ . Based on the above argument, it seems every very ample invertible sheaf over a projective scheme (at least those coming from closed immersions coming from surjective ring maps, by proposition 5.12(c)) will be isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ . Is this true? If it's not, in what sense was the quoted result proven by theorem 5.17? Also, is this rephrasing merely meant to suggest the definition of ample provided on p. 153? Finally, I am confused about the notation found in the proof of theorem 7.6, in chapter II. The setting is $X$ a scheme of finite type over a noetherian ring $A$ , and $\mathcal{L}$ an invertible sheaf on $X$ . One direction of the theorem is that if $\mathcal{L}^m$ is very ample implies $\mathcal{L}$ is ample. The proof begins with $i: X \rightarrow \mathbb{P}_A^n$ , an immersion with $\mathcal{L}^m \simeq i^*(\mathcal{O}(1))$ . Then given any coherent $\mathcal{F}$ , consider the closure $\overline{X}$ in projective space and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ the coherent sheaf which is the extension of $\mathcal{F}$ to $\overline{X}$ . Then it is noted that if $\overline{\mathcal{F}} \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\overline{X}}(l)$ is generated by global sections, hence $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{O}_X(l)$ is also. My question is, what is the meaning of $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ ? The map $i$ is just an immersion, so we don't know that $X$ is Proj of some graded ring. Is $\mathcal{O}_X(l)$ just a short-hand for $\mathcal{L}^l$ ?","I'm a bit confused by some notation in Hartshorne's chapter II (theorems II.5.17, II.7.6, and some discussion on ample invertible sheaves in section 7).

Then there is an integer such that for all , the sheaf can be generated by a finite number of global sections. Proof. Let be a closed immersion of into a projective space , such that ... [The remainder of the paragraph is devoted to reducing to the case where is Proj of a polynomial ring.] First, what is meant by the hypothesis "" be a very ample invertible sheaf on "", since, a priori, is not projective space or Proj of a graded ring? I see that one can appeal to Corollary 5.16 to see that is for some graded ring , finitely generated by as an -algebra. Then one can take . Then this is very ample since we can use the description of to construct a closed immersion with (by Proposition 5.12(c)), which is just . Is this the correct interpretation? Second, on p. 153, this result is later quoted as having established: for any very ample invertible sheaf on a projective scheme over , for any coherent , there is an such that implies is generated by global sections, which appears slightly different than the above result, since we worked with the particular very ample invertible sheaf . Based on the above argument, it seems every very ample invertible sheaf over a projective scheme (at least those coming from closed immersions coming from surjective ring maps, by proposition 5.12(c)) will be isomorphic to . Is this true? If it's not, in what sense was the quoted result proven by theorem 5.17? Also, is this rephrasing merely meant to suggest the definition of ample provided on p. 153? Finally, I am confused about the notation found in the proof of theorem 7.6, in chapter II. The setting is a scheme of finite type over a noetherian ring , and an invertible sheaf on . One direction of the theorem is that if is very ample implies is ample. The proof begins with , an immersion with . Then given any coherent , consider the closure in projective space and the coherent sheaf which is the extension of to . Then it is noted that if is generated by global sections, hence is also.

We are given a coaction $ \rho : A \to A \otimes H$ , which is a morphism of $k$ algebras. The counit axiom implies that the coaction map $\rho: A \to A \otimes H$ is injective (it explicitly gives an inverse), hence the direct sum structure on $A \otimes H$ given by $H = \bigoplus_{ n \in \mathbb{Z}} k_{x^n} \otimes_k A$ pulls back via $\rho^{-1}$ to give a direct sum decomposition of $A$ : $A = \bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \rho^{-1} (k_{x^n} \otimes A)$ .

The proof fails because that $gk_\alpha=h_\alpha$ is valid on $U_\alpha$ only, while the last but one equation on Page 61 must work on the whole domain of the regular function. I have been trying to give a proof or find a counterexample. The proof for the case in which the variety is irreducible is easy. In the reducible case, I managed to reduce the question to the following one: Suppose we are working with a algebraically closed field K and a regular function on an open subset of an affine variety is by definition a function locally representable as $F/G$, with $F,G\in K[x_1,...,x_n]$, and $G$ non-vanishing in a neighbourhood.

66,How do I compute the number of intersection points of these three surfaces in $\mathbb A^3$,How do I compute the number of intersection points of these three surfaces in,\mathbb A^3,"The setting (ambient space) for this question is the projective space $\mathbb P^3$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ , with homogeneous coordinates $x,y,z,w$ . We choose $w = 0$ as the plane at infinity. Let $P, Q, R$ be surfaces of degree $d+1$ in $\mathbb P^3$ , whose set-theoretic intersection is the union of a finite number of points in $\mathbb A^3$ and a curve $C$ of degree $d$ on the plane at infinity. Assume none of $P, Q, R$ contains the plane at infinity. My goal is to find the number of intersection points in $\mathbb A^3$ , counted with multiplicity. I expect this number to be exactly $$d^3 + d^2 + d + 1 = (d^2 + 1)(d + 1),$$ and this can be proven to be the case when $k = \mathbb C$ , using complex analytic methods. We shall identify $P, Q, R$ with their defining polynomials in $k[x,y,z,w]$ . Similarly, we shall identify $C$ with its defining polynomial in $k[x,y,z]$ . Then we may write $$P = xC - wF, \qquad Q = yC - wG, \qquad R = zC - wH,$$ where $F, G, H$ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ . FAILED ATTEMPT: My original strategy was to proceed as follows: Replace $R$ with a sufficiently general surface $S$ , also of degree $d+1$ . Assume $P \cap Q \cap R$ and $P \cap Q \cap S$ have the same number of points in $\mathbb A^3$ . Count how many points $P \cap Q \cap S$ has on the plane at infinity (i.e., on $C$ ), and subtract them from $(d + 1)^3$ . Unfortunately, this does not work. Using numerical experiments, I have found that $P \cap Q \cap S$ might have up to $d^3 + 2d^2 + 2d + 1 = (d^2 + d + 1) (d + 1)$ points in $\mathbb A^3$ , violating assumption 2. CURRENT STRATEGY: From now on, consider $A = k[x,y,z,w]$ , the homogeneous coordinate ring of $\mathbb P^3$ . $\mathfrak a = (P)$ , the ideal of the first surface. $\mathfrak b = (P, Q)$ , the ideal of the intersection of the first two surfaces. $\mathfrak c = (P, Q, R)$ , the ideal of the intersection of all three surfaces. First we show that $P, Q, R$ are pairwise coprime. By assumption, none of them is a multiple of $w$ . Now suppose two of them, say $P$ and $Q$ , had a common prime factor. This factor would be an irreducible component of $P \cap Q$ that is mostly contained in $\mathbb A^3$ . Hence $P \cap Q \cap R$ would contain a curve mostly contained in $\mathbb A^3$ , which we have assumed is not the case. Since $A/\mathfrak a$ and $A/\mathfrak b$ are complete intersections, we have the exact sequences $$ 0 \longrightarrow A(-d-1)   \longrightarrow A   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a   \longrightarrow 0 $$ and $$ 0 \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a(-d-1)   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak a   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b   \longrightarrow 0. $$ On the other hand, $A/\mathfrak c$ is not a complete intersection, so $R$ must be a zero divisor in $A/\mathfrak b$ . Then we have a short exact sequence of the form $$ 0 \longrightarrow K   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b(-d-1)   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak b   \longrightarrow A/\mathfrak c   \longrightarrow 0, \DeclareMathOperator \Hilb {Hilb} $$ where $K$ is not trivial. Taking Hilbert polynomials, we have $\Hilb_A(n) = \binom {n+3} 3$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n) = \Hilb_A(n) - \Hilb_A(n-d-1)$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n) = \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n) - \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak a}(n-d-1)$ $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak c}(n) = \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n) - \Hilb_{A/\mathfrak b}(n-d-1) + \Hilb_K(n) = (d + 1)^3 + \Hilb_K(n)$ Now consider a prime filtration of the form $$0 = M_0 \subset M_1 \subset \dots \subset M_r = A/\mathfrak c,$$ and let $\mathfrak p_i$ be the prime ideals such that $M_i/M_{i-1} = A/\mathfrak p_i(d_i)$ . Each $\mathfrak p_i$ is one of the following: The prime ideal of the curve $C$ , i.e., $\mathfrak p$ . The prime ideal of an embedded point on $C$ . The prime ideal of an isolated intersection point in $\mathbb A^3$ . The irrelevant ideal $\mathfrak m = (x,y,z)$ . We may ignore any occurrences of $\mathfrak m$ , because they do not contribute to $\Hilb_{A/\mathfrak c}(n)$ . So we need to compute The $A$ -module $K$ , or at least enough information to recover $\Hilb_K(n)$ . The number of embedded points in $C$ , counted with multiplicity. The degree of the Serre twist applied to $A/\mathfrak p$ , wherever it might occur in the prime filtration. How do I even begin to do this? BAD NEWS: Using even more numerical experiments, I have found that I was careless when stating the problem. The actual problem that I am trying to solve is the following. I have an algebraic foliation of $\mathbb P^3$ by curves, defined in $\mathbb A^3$ by the polynomial vector field $$\mathcal F : P^\flat \frac \partial {\partial x} + Q^\flat \frac \partial {\partial y} + R^\flat \frac \partial {\partial z},$$ where $P^\flat, Q^\flat, R^\flat$ denote the dehomogenizations (i.e., setting $w = 1$ ) of the polynomials $P, Q, R$ at the beginning of this post. We further assume that $\mathcal F$ contains only isolated singularities. If the plane at infinity is chosen generically, then all the singularities are in $\mathbb A^3$ , and the curve $C$ mentioned above is the set of points on the plane at infinity where $\mathcal F$ is tangent to this plane. It follows from these assumptions that $P, Q, R$ have the form stated above: $$P = xC - wF, \qquad Q = yC - wG, \qquad R = zC - wH.$$ However, the implication is strict. It does not follow from these three equations that $\mathcal F$ does not have singularities on the plane at infinity!

82,Scheme-theoretic proof of a correspondence between multiple tangents on a plane curve and ordinary $r$-fold points on the dual curve?,Scheme-theoretic proof of a correspondence between multiple tangents on a plane curve and ordinary -fold points on the dual curve?,r,"Let $X$ be a curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0.$ We say that a line of $\mathbb{P}^2_k$ is a multiple tangent of $X$ if it is tangent to $X$ at more than one point. If $L$ is a multiple tangent of $X,$ tangent to $X$ at the points $P_1, \ldots, P_r$ and if none of the $P_i$ is an inflection point, show that the corresponding point of the dual curve $X^*$ is an ordinary $r$-fold point, meaning that it is a point of multiplicity $r$ with distinct tangent directions. This is obvious from a geometric point-of-view, but I would like to give a rigorous proof of this fact, using say some scheme-theory. I would be grateful for explanations on how to prove this, or references. Update 22 nov: So, I see how one can do this if one assumes the (non-obvious) fact that the map $X \rightarrow X^*$ is the normalization of $X^*.$ To prove this one needs to show that the Gauss map $X \rightarrow X^*$ is birational, and I can prove that this is the case if I know that there are finitely many multiple tangents. So I'm back at step one. I think the above should have an elementary proof since it is in Hartshorne, but I can't seem to find the right approach. Update 23 nov: So I received an answer, but this is not the sort of answer I was after (I don't think it is rigorous either). Let me sketch the proof I had in mind if I knew that the Gauss map was birational. If so, we could identify $X \rightarrow X^*$ with the normalization, and if so, we can identify $X$ with blowing-up at singular points of $X^*.$  Then saying that the blow-up of $X^*$ along $L$ gives $r$ points such that the induced map on tangent spaces is injective is precisely the fact that $L$ is an ordinary $r$-fold point. This is a purely algebraic proof in some sense, and doesn't use the analytic category. Update 24 nov: The previous answer I received was deleted and then replaced with basically the same answer, but changed some small details. This is still not the sort of proof I have in mind, so let me be extra clear. I would want a purely algebraic proof of the fact that multiple tangents of $X$ corresponds to ordinary $r$-fold points. Preferably, I would want a proof that would not pass to the analytic category and not use the full strength of the biduality theorem. The reason I think the biduality theorem should not be used is that Hartshorne never mentions it, so I would suspect he had something other in mind.

The questions are inserted from time to time within the proof. Thanks for your patience. Notation Let $Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety. Letting $S=k[x_0,\dots, x_n]$ (equipped with the usual grading $S=\oplus_{r\ge 0} S_r$ ), there is a naturale grading on $S(Y)=S/I(Y)$ which is constructed as follows: for each integer $r\ge 0$ define $$S(Y)_r:=S_r/I(Y)_r:=\{f+I(Y)_r\;:\; f\in S_r\}$$ where $I(Y)_r=I(Y)\cap S_r.$ Theorem. Let $Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$ . Then we have: $(a)\quad$ for any point $P\in Y$ , let $\mathcal{m}_P\subseteq S(Y)$ denote the ideal generated by the set of all homogeneous elements $f\in S(Y)$ such that $f(P)=0$ . Then $\mathcal{O}_P=S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}$ ; $(b)\quad$ $K(Y)\cong S(Y)_{((0))}$ Proof. Let $U_i\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be the open set defined by $x_i\ne 0$ and set $Y_i:= Y\cap U_i$ . We may consider $Y_i$ as an affine variety. We can construct a natural isomorphism $$\varphi_i^*\colon A(Y_i)\to S(Y)_{(x_i)}$$ as $$\varphi_i^*\bigg(f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-i},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)\bigg)=\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r},$$ where $f\in S_r$ . $(b)\quad$ Let $P\in Y$ and chose any $i$ so that the $i-$ th coordinate of $P$ is non-zero. Then $P\in Y\cap U_i$ . We may write $P=[a_0:\dots: a_{i-1}:1:a_i:\dots: a_n]$ . Set $P_0:=(a_0,\dots, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1},\dots, a_n)=\varphi_i(P)$ , the corresponding point in the affine space. Denote with $\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}$ the maximal ideal of $A(Y_i)$ corresponding to $P_0$ . More precisely, $$\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}=\bigg\{g+I(Y_i)\in A(Y_i)\;:\; g(P_0)=0\bigg\}.$$ It's easy to prove that: $$\boxed{\varphi_i^*(\mathcal{m'}_{P_0})=\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$$ Recall that the product in the right of the above equation is interpreted in the localization as follows (with the natural induced grading on the quotient ring $S(Y)=S/I(Y))$ $$\mathcal{m}_p\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}=\bigg\{\frac{f(x_0\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}\;:\; f+I(Y)_r\in\mathcal{m}_P\cap S(Y)_r\;\text{for same}\; r\ge 0\bigg\}.$$ Using this isomorphism, we then have the isomorphism of the localizations $$A(Y_i)_{\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}}\cong \big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$$ Question 1. I believe that the last isomorphism can be obtained from exercise number 4 on page 44 of Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Atiyay - MacDonald, is that so? We need to argue that $$\big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}\cong S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}\tag1$$ Question2. Why $(1)$ is not usual transitivity of localizations? A typical element in $\big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$ is of the form $$\frac{\frac{f+I(Y)_{s+r}}{x_i^{r+s}+I(Y)_{s+r}}}{\frac{g+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}\equiv \frac{f+I(Y)_{s+r}}{x_i^sg+I(Y)_{s+r}}$$ where $g+I(Y)_r\notin\mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_r$ , and the identification takes place in the quotient field of $S(Y)$ . Now since $x_i^s+I(Y)_s\notin \mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_s$ it follows that the product $x_i^sg +I(Y)_{s+r}\notin\mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_{s+r}$ . So the element on the right is a degree $0$ element of the localization $$S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\big(S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}\big)_n$$ where $$\big(S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}\big)_n=\bigg\{\frac{p+I(Y)_{n+r}}{q+I(Y)_r}\;:\; q+I(Y)_r\notin \mathcal{m}_P\cap S(Y)_r\;\text{for same}\; r\ge 0\bigg\}.$$ This proves that $$A(Y_i)_{\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}}\cong (S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_p})_0=S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}$$ $(b)\quad$ Observe that $K(Y)\cong K(Y_i)$ . The final part is to show that $$K(Y_i)\cong S(Y)_{((0))}.$$ We have already obtained the isomorphism $\varphi_i^*\colon A(Y_i)\to S(Y)_{(x_i)}$ . Extending this isomorpgism to $\tilde{\varphi_i^{*}}$ on the quotient fields fo both the sides we get $$\tilde{\varphi_i^*}\bigg(\frac{f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}{g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}\bigg)=\frac{\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}{\frac{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_s}{x_i^s+I(Y)_s}}=\frac{x_i^s f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r+s}}{x_i^rg(x_0, \dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r+s}}$$ In the denominator of the last expression above we have $g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_s\ne 0$ So to make sense of this, we need $x_i^r+I(Y)_r\ne 0$ as well. Since $I(Y)$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, this is violated only if $x_i\in I(Y)$ . I have proved that $x_i\in I(Y)$ is equivalent to $Y_i=\emptyset$ , which is absurd according to our choise of $U_i$ . Finally, notice that the element in the image of $\tilde{\varphi_i^*}$ in above are elements of $S(Y)_{((0))}$ . Question 3 It remains to show that every element of $S(Y)_{((0))}$ is also an image of an element of $K(Y_i)$ . How can I show this? My Solution for question 3. A typical element in $S(Y)_{((0))}$ is of the form $$\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r},$$ where $f+I(Y)_r\in S(Y)_r$ and $g+I(Y)_r\notin S(Y)_r\cap (0)$ . Let us consider the dehomogenized of $f$ and $g$ : $$f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n)\quad\text{and}\quad g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n),$$ where $\deg f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n)= \deg g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n) = r$ , results $$\begin{split}\tilde{\varphi_i^*}\bigg(\frac{f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}{g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}\bigg)=&\frac{\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}{\frac{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}\\ =\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}{g(x_0, \dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}\end{split}$$ The above happens just in case $x_i\nmid f$ and $x_i \nmid g$ .

Collecting the Gromov-Witten invariants in a generating function seems like a sensible thing to do (and is supposedly related to free energy in the topological $A$ -model), but I don't see where the quantum product comes from. I vaguely understand that this is supposed to come from quantum field theory/string theory, but the only connection to that effect that I'm aware of is the equivalence between 2D TQFTs and Frobenius algebras and the identity $\langle a*b, c\rangle = \langle a,b,c\rangle$ (which comes from diffeomorphism invariance); setting the three point functions to be Gromov-Witten invariants for (as an example) $\mathbb{P}^r$ produces a TQFT with quantum product $\ast$ defined by the above identity and linearity: $$h^i * h^j = \sum_{e+f =r} \langle h^i,h^j,h^e \rangle h^f$$ where $h \in H^\ast(\mathbb{P}^r)$ is the hyperplane class. Examining the nonvanishing GW invariants, this produces the ring structure $\mathbb{Z}[h]/(h^{r+1}-1)$ which is the $q=1$ limit of the small quantum cohomology ring, or, equivalently, the $\mathbf{x} =0$ limit of the big quantum cohomology ring.

92,"Ideal of $k[x,y]$ invariant under an involution",Ideal of  invariant under an involution,"k[x,y]","Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero. The two-dimensional case: Let $p,q \in k[x,y]$ , $I=\langle p,q \rangle$ a proper ideal of $k[x,y]$ and $\delta$ an involution on $k[x,y]$ , namely, a $k$ -algebra automorphism of order two. Denote the set of symmetric elements with respect to $\delta$ by $S_{\delta}$ and the set of skew-symmetric elements with respect to $\delta$ by $K_{\delta}$ . Assume that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ . Further assume that: (i) $\delta: (x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ . (ii) $(p,q)$ is a Jacobian pair, namely, there exists a $k$ -algebra endomorphism $f: (x,y) \mapsto (p,q)$ such that $\operatorname{Jac}(p,q):=p_xq_y-p_yq_x \in k-\{0\}$ . Is the following claim true:   There exist $k$ -algebra automorphisms $g,h$ of $k[x,y]$ ,   such that one of $\{(gfh)(x),(gfh)(y)\}$ belongs to $S_\epsilon \cup K_\epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is an involution on $k[x,y]$ . Remarks: (a) It can be shown that there exist two conjugacy classes of involutions on $k[x,y]$ : That of $(x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ (Jacobian $-1$ ) and that of $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,-y)$ (Jacobian $1$ ). (b) An easy observation: If $p$ is symmetric w.r.t. an involution $\beta$ , then $g^{-1}(p)$ is symmetric w.r.t. $\gamma= g^{-1}\beta g$ ; indeed, $p=\beta(p)$ , so $p=(g \gamma g^{-1})(p)$ , then $g^{-1}(p)=\gamma (g^{-1}(p))$ . (Same argument with skew-symmetric instead of symmetric). (c) Notice that Arthur's comment is included in the above claim; indeed, $k-\{0\} \ni \operatorname{Jac}(aS+bK,cS+dK)=(ad-bc)\operatorname{Jac}(S,K)$ , so $ad-bc \in k-\{0\}$ (which means that $aS+bK, cS+dK$ are linearly independent over $k$ ). If one of $\{a,b,c,d\}$ equals to zero, then we are done. Otherwise, it is not difficult to find an automorphism g of $k[x,y]$ such that $g(p)=S$ or $g(p)=K$ , and we are also done. (d) Am I missing a known theorem that can be applied here? Perhaps a theorem concerning group actions? Fixed points theorems? Algebraic geometry? C-star algebras? Please see this question. The one-dimensional case: Notice that in $k[x]$ an analog result holds, at least for $\delta: x \mapsto -x$ , (which is actually the 'unique' involution on $k[x]$ ) namely: If $I$ is an ideal of $k[x]$ which is invariant under $\delta$ , then $I=\langle h \rangle$ , where $h$ is either an odd polynomial (= a skew-symmetric element with respect to $\delta$ ) or an even polynomial (= a symmetric element with respect to $\delta$ ). Indeed: $k[x]$ is a PID, so $I=\langle h \rangle$ , for some $h \in k[x]$ . We assumed that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ , hence, in particular, $\delta(h) \in I$ , so there exists $g \in k[x]$ such that $\delta(h)=gh$ . Of course, $\deg(\delta(h))=\deg(h)$ and $\deg(gh)=\deg(g)+\deg(h)$ . Therefore, $\deg(g)=0$ , so $g=\lambda \in k$ . Write $h=s+k$ with $s$ even (= symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ and $k$ odd (= skew-symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ ). We have $s-k=\delta(h)=\lambda h= \lambda (s+k)$ . Then, $(1-\lambda)s=(1+\lambda)k$ . Denote $w:=(1-\lambda)s=(1+\lambda)k$ . From $S_{\delta} \cap K_{\delta} =\{0\}$ , we obtain that $w=0$ , so $(1-\lambda)s=0$ and $(1+\lambda)k=0$ . (i) $(1-\lambda)s=0$ implies that $\lambda=1$ or $s=0$ . If $\lambda=1$ , then $\delta(h)=h$ , so $h$ is symmetric. If $s=0$ , then $h$ is skew-symmetric. (ii) $(1+\lambda)k=0$ implies that $\lambda=-1$ or $k=0$ . If $\lambda=-1$ , then $\delta(h)=-h$ , so $h$ is skew-symmetric. If $k=0$ , then $h$ is symmetric. Concluding that $h$ is symmetric or skew-symmetric, as claimed. Remark: Concerning the 'uniqueness' of the involution $x \mapsto -x$ ; there exists other involutions, for example, $f_c: x \mapsto -x+c$ , for arbitrary $c \in k$ . ( $f_c^2(x)=f_c(f_c(x))=f_c(-x+c)=-f_c(x)+c=-(-x+c)+c=x-c+c=x$ ). Luckily, my above argument (for $\delta=f_0$ ) still shows that if $f_c(I) \subseteq I$ , $c \in k$ , then $I=\langle h \rangle$ with $h$ symmetric or skew-symmetric with respect to $f_c$ ; indeed, the only place where we used the specific form of $\delta=f_0$ was  ""Of course, $\deg(\delta(h))=\deg(h)$ "", and this trivial observation still holds if we replace $\delta=f_0$ by $f_c$ , $c \in k-\{0\}$ . Concerning the two-dimensional case: Write $p=s_1+k_1$ and $q=s_2+k_2$ , where $s_1,s_2 \in S_{\delta}$ and $k_1,k_2 \in K_{\delta}$ , $\delta: (x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$ . Several attempts/ideas to answer my question: (1) By assumption, $\delta(p) \in I=\langle p,q \rangle$ , so $s_1-k_1 = A(s_1+k_1)+B(s_2+k_2)$ , for some $A,B \in k[x,y]$ . Then $(1-A)s_1-Bs_2=(1+A)k_1+Bk_2$ ; however, this does not tell much, since $A,B \in k[x,y]$ , not in $k$ . (If $A,B \in k$ , then we obtain that $w=0$ , where $w:=(1-A)s_1-Bs_2=(1+A)k_1+Bk_2$ .  Therefore, $s_1=\mu s_2$ and $k_1= \nu k_2$ ,  where $\mu,\nu \in k$ , and we have obtained the special form that Arthur has suggested). We can further write: $A=A_s+A_k$ and $B=B_s+B_k$ , where $A_s,B_s \in S_\delta$ and $A_k,B_k \in K_\delta$ . (2) I have written $s_1,s_2,k_1,k_2$ as elements of $I$ , and also applied $\delta$ on both sides, but the equations I have reached did not help much. Perhaps I will add my calculations later. (3) We have assumed that $p \neq q$ , since otherwise $I=\langle p \rangle$ , so the one-dimensional proof can be adjusted here, in short: We assumed that $\delta(I) \subseteq I$ , hence, in particular, $\delta(p) \in I=\langle p \rangle$ , so there exists $g \in k[x,y]$ such that $\delta(p)=gp$ . Of course, $\deg(\delta(p))=\deg(p)$ and $\deg(gp)=\deg(g)+\deg(p)$ . Therefore, $\deg(g)=0$ , so $g=\lambda \in k$ . From $p=s_1+k_1$ with $s_1$ symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ and $k_1$ skew-symmetric w.r.t. $\delta$ , we have $s_1-k_1=\delta(p)=\lambda p= \lambda (s_1+k_1)$ . Then, $(1-\lambda)s_1=(1+\lambda)k_1$ .
