3,Question about Stein's Real Analysis Lemma 3.5 in Chapter 2,Question about Stein's Real Analysis Lemma 3.5 in Chapter 2,,"Lemma $3.5$ If $E_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ and $E_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ , then $$m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) \leq m_* \left( E_1 \right) m_* \left( E_2 \right),$$ with the understanding that if one of the sets $E_j$ has exterior measure zero, then $m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) = 0$ . The above is the statement of Lemma $3.5$ in chapter $2$ of Stein's real analysis. The author proves that $m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) \leq \left( m_* \left( E_1 \right) + \epsilon \right) \left( m_* \left( E_2 \right) + \epsilon \right)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ . I think this completes the proof of the Lemma $3.5$ by the arbitrariness of $\epsilon > 0$ . However, in the textbook, it is divided into two cases as follows: If neither $E_1$ nor $E_2$ has exterior measure $0$ , then from the above we find $$m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) \leq m_* \left( E_1 \right) m_* \left( E_2 \right) + O \left( \epsilon \right),$$ and since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we must have $m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) \leq m_* \left( E_1 \right) m_* \left( E_2 \right)$ . If for instance $m_* \left( E_1 \right) = 0$ , consider for each positive integer $j$ the set $E_2^j = E_2 \cap \left\{ y \in \mathbb{R}^{d_2} : \left\lvert y \right\rvert \leq j \right\}$ . Then, by the above argument, we find that $m_* ( E_1 \times E_2^j ) = 0$ . since $( E_1 \times E_2^j ) \nearrow \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right)$ as $j \to \infty$ , we conclude that $m_* \left( E_1 \times E_2 \right) = 0$ . But, why do we have to divide the cases? It seems to me that it suffices to describe it as the case that $E_1$ and $E_2$ has nonzero exterior measure, in both cases. Am I missing something?

7,Does this measurable function exist and satisfy my motivation?,Does this measurable function exist and satisfy my motivation?,,"Main Question: Does there exist a function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ such that: the function $f$ is measurable in the sense of Caratheodory the graph of $f$ is dense in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ with pre-images under $f$ that are measurable in the sense of Caratheodory is a non-perfect dense set in the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ , such that we define a topology where: Let ${\mathbb P}[0,1]$ be the collection of all subsets of $[0,1]$ modulo the equivalence relation $\sim$ defined by $E \sim F \Leftrightarrow {\lambda^{*}(E \Delta F)} = 0,$ where $\lambda^{*}$ is Lebesgue outer measure and $\Delta$ is the symmetric difference operation on sets. The set ${\mathbb P}[0,1]$ can be made into a complete metric space by defining the distance function $d,$ where $d(E,F) = {\lambda^{*} (E \Delta F)}.$ the graph of $f$ is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ using the uniform probability measure , the expected value of $f$ is undefined? Motivation: We want to define a function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ where the graph of $f$ is somewhat but not too evenly distributed (i.e. with complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ , such that using the uniform probability measure , the expected value of $f$ is undefined so we can find an unique extension of the expected value which gives a finite value instead . Question on motivation: If the function from the main question exists, does it give the same function as the one from the motivation? Simplified Version of the Main Question: In the main question , a non-perfect dense set in the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ is “topologically large” in the collection of all subsets of the range of $f$ , where the main question translates to the following: Does there exist measurable function $f:[0,1]\to[0,1]$ such the graph of $f$ is dense in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ , where the pre-image of a “ random subset ” of the range of $f$ under $f$ is “likely” to be measurable in the sense of Caratheodory, where the graph of $f$ is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ , and w.r.t the uniform probability measure the expected value of $f$ is undefined? Attempt to Solve Both Questions: I can't prove an explicit example exists but here is my attempt from this question ( note in the link, the previous question didn't give a function that satisified the motivation in this post ): Suppose the base- $3$ expansion of real numbers, in interval $[0,1]$ , have infinite decimals that approach $x\in[0,1]$ from the right side so when $0\le x_1,x_2\le 1$ (and $x_1=x_2$ ) we get $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ . Furthermore, for $\mathbb{N}\cup\left\{0\right\}=\mathbb{N}_{0}$ , if $r\in\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and $\text{digit}_{3}:\mathbb{R}\times  \mathbb{Z}\to\left\{0,1,2\right\}$ is a function where $\text{digit}_{3}(x,r)$ takes the digit in the $3^{r}$ -th decimal fraction of the base- $3$ expansion of $x$ (e.g. $\text{digit}_{3}(1.789,2)=\text{digit}_{3}({1.210022{\cdot\cdot\cdot}}_{3},2)=1$ ), then $\left\{{g_r}^{\prime}\right\}_{r\in\mathbb{N}_{0}}$ is a sequence of functions (and $\left[\cdot\right]$ is the nearest integer function) such that ${g_r}^{\prime}:\mathbb{N}_0\to\mathbb{N}_0$ is defined to be: \begin{equation}   g_r^{\prime}(x)=\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin(rx)+\frac{10}{3}\right]  \end{equation} then for some function $k:\mathbb{N}_{0}\to\mathbb{N}_{0}$ , where $k$ is strictly increasing, such that $k(0)$ is a positive number, and the intermediate function (before $f$ ) or $f_{1}:[0,1]\to[0,10]$ satisfies the main question if the range is $[0,10]$ instead of $[0,1]$ . \begin{alignat}{2} & f_{1}(x)  =  &&\left|\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}  g_{r+1}^{\prime}\!\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\!\!\bigg/3^{r}\right)-10\right|=  \label{eq:025} \\ & &&  \left|\left(\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin\left(\left(r+1\right)\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\right)+\frac{10}{3}\right]\right)\!\!\bigg  /3^{r}\right)-10\right| \nonumber \end{alignat} (One example of $k(r)$ that may satisfy the problem, i.e. if the range is $[0,10]$ , is $k(r)=10r+20$ ) What we are doing with $f_1$ is we converted every digit of the base- $3$ expansion of $x$ into a pseudo-random number that is non-equally likely to be an integer, including and in-between, $0$ and $20/3$ . Further, we attempt to make the function dense in $[0,1]\times[0,10]$ by adding the $3^{r}$ -th decimal fraction with the next $k$ decimal fractions; however, we want to control the end-points of $[0,10]$ such that $f_1$ is dense in $\left[0,1\right]\times\left[0,1\right]$ (instead of $\left[0,1\right]\times[0,10]$ ) by manipulating $f_1$ to get: \begin{alignat}{2} & f(x)  = && 1-\frac{1}{10}f_1(x)\label{eq:109}\\  & &&   1-\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)\left|\left(\left(\sum\limits_{r=0}^{\infty}\left[\frac{10}{3}\sin\left(\left(r+1\right)\left(\sum\limits_{p=r}^{r+k(r)}\text{digit}_{3}(x,p)\right)\right)+\frac{10}{3}\right]\right)\!\!\bigg/3^{r}\right)-10\right|  \nonumber \end{alignat} (e.g. $k(r)=10r+20$ ) you can use programming to visualize $f$ though I don't know if you can graph the entire function.

The set can be made into a complete metric space by defining the distance function where the graph of is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in using the uniform probability measure , the expected value of is undefined? Motivation: We want to define a function where the graph of is somewhat but not too evenly distributed (i.e. with complete spacial randomness ) in , such that using the uniform probability measure , the expected value of is undefined so we can find an unique extension of the expected value which gives a finite value instead . Question on motivation: If the function from the main question exists, does it give the same function as the one from the motivation? Simplified Version of the Main Question: In the main question , a non-perfect dense set in the collection of all subsets of the range of is “topologically large” in the collection of all subsets of the range of , where the main question translates to the following: Does there exist measurable function such the graph of is dense in , where the pre-image of a “ random subset ” of the range of under is “likely” to be measurable in the sense of Caratheodory, where the graph of is non-uniform (i.e. without complete spacial randomness ) in , and w.r.t the uniform probability measure the expected value of is undefined? Attempt to Solve Both Questions: I can't prove an explicit example exists but here is my attempt from this question ( note in the link, the previous question didn't give a function that satisified the motivation in this post ): Suppose the base- expansion of real numbers, in interval , have infinite decimals that approach from the right side so when (and ) we get . Furthermore, for , if and is a function where takes the digit in the -th decimal fraction of the base- expansion of (e.g. ), then is a sequence of functions (and is the nearest integer function) such that is defined to be: then for some function , where is strictly increasing, such that is a positive number, and the intermediate function (before ) or satisfies the main question if the range is instead of . (One example of that may satisfy the problem, i.e. if the range is , is ) What we are doing with is we converted every digit of the base- expansion of into a pseudo-random number that is non-equally likely to be an integer, including and in-between, and . Further, we attempt to make the function dense in by adding the -th decimal fraction with the next decimal fractions; however, we want to control the end-points of such that is dense in (instead of ) by manipulating to get: (e.g. ) you can use programming to visualize though I don't know if you can graph the entire function.

The author begins by assuming $0 \le f < 1$ and concludes the first part of the proof by noting $0\le f \le 1$ ? Though both seem to work, for the sake of consistency one of the two must be a typographical error - and I believe it's the first one. Could you confirm? Why is $2^{-n}h_n(x) = t_n$ except in $V_n - K_n$ ? I know that $h_n(x) = 1$ for all $x\in K_n$ and $h_n(x) = 0$ for all $x\notin V_n$ . Also, $0\le h(x) \le 1$ for $x\in V_n-K_n$ . How is the assumption of compactness dropped? If $\mu(A) < \infty$ then for every $\epsilon_0 > 0$ there is compact $K\subset A$ such that $\mu(A-K) < \epsilon_0$ . I'm thinking about $\tilde f = \chi_K f$ , and since $K$ is compact, it is clear that we can find a continuous real-valued function $g$ such that $\mu(\{x: g(x) \ne \tilde f(x)\} < \epsilon_0$ , for every $\epsilon_0 > 0$ . How do I use this to approximate $f$ by $g$ in the sense of Lusin's theorem? Next they consider $f$ to be complex measurable, $B_n = \{x: |f(x)| > n\}$ and claim $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B_n = \varnothing$ . To see this, assume $x\in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty B_n$ , thus $x \in B_n$ for all $n$ , i.e. $|f(x)| > n$ for all $n$ . Taking limits as $n\to\infty$ , $|f(x)| \ge \infty$ , that is $|f(x)| = \infty$ . This is not possible, since $\infty$ is not in $\mathbb R$ . Seems fine? Thus, $\mu(B_n)\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ . $f$ coincides with $\tilde f_n = (1 - \chi_{B_n}) f$ , which is bounded. So we can find a continuous $g$ such that $\mu(\{x: g(x) \ne \tilde f_n(x)\}) <\epsilon/2$ . Since $\tilde f_n$ and $f$ agree except on a set whose measure approaches zero as $n\to\infty$ , it is clear that we can find $n$ large enough so that $\mu(\{x: \tilde f_n(x) \ne f(x)\}) <\epsilon/2$ .

I'm comfortable with the formal definition that says a function $f:X\to Y$ is measurable if the pre-image of any measurable set is measurable.

In that case, I'm would like to know why pre-images do the trick and not the images of functions. If I wanted to know if $f$ preserved the structure, then my first idea would be to make sure that measurable sets are mapped into/to measurable sets, not to look at pre-images. Continuity has almost the same definition. However, this comes from the generalization of the $\epsilon$ - $\delta$ definition of continuity from analysis/metric spaces.

For one , if $Y$ does not have a measure an $X$ has $\mu$ , then we can pull-back to get $\mu\circ f$ . However, this issue doesn't arise when both spaces are measurable.

Denote with $\mathcal{U}_0(\mathcal{C})$ the family of the finite disjoint unions of $\mathcal{C}$ elements. I've already proved that $$\mathcal{U}_0(\mathcal{C})=\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).$$ Hence for each $E\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ exists $E_1,\dots, E_n\in\mathcal{C}$ disjoint such that $E=\cup_{k=1}^n E_k.$ We define an application $\mu\colon\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}_+$ in the following way $$\mu(E):=\sum_{k=1}^n\nu(E_k)\quad\text{for each}\quad E\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).\tag1$$ Obviously $\mu_{|\mathcal{C}}=\nu.$ First step.

Let $\{F_l\}\subseteq\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ a sequence of disjoint subsets such that $F:=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty} F_l\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C}).$ We must prove that $$\mu(F)=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty} \mu(F_l).\tag2$$ Since $F\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ , exists $B_1,\dots, B_m\in\mathcal{C}$ disjoint such that $F=\sum_{k=1}^{m} B_k.$ Therefore, $$B_k=B_k\cap F=\bigcup_{l=1}^\infty (B_k\cap F_l),\quad k=1,\dots, m.$$ Similarly, for each $F_l\in\mathcal{A}_0(\mathcal{C})$ exists a disjoint finite family $\{E_{jl}\}\subseteq \mathcal{C}\quad(j=1,\dots, n_l)$ such that $F_l=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} E_{jl},\;l\in\mathbb{N}.$ Then $$B_k=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty} (B_k\cap F_l)=\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl}).$$ Moreover, $$F_l=F\cap F_l=\bigcup_{k=1}^m\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} (B_k\cap E_{jl}),$$ hence $$\mu(F_l)=\sum_{k=1}^m\sum_{j=1}^{n_l}\nu(B_k\cap E_{jl}),$$ for $(1).$ Now, $$\nu(B_k)=\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg)\color{RED}{=} \sum_{l=1}^{\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{n_l}\nu(B_k\cap E_{jl})$$ Question Is the equality in red true? I know that $B_k\in\mathcal{C}$ and $\nu$ is a measure on it, therefore $\nu$ is $\sigma$ - additive but I'm used to having only one union in the argument of $\nu$ , in this case how does it work? How I feel about it I think that equality is correct, because fix $l=1, l=2$ and consider $A_{n_1}:=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_1} (B_k\cap E_{j1})$ and $A_{n_2}:=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_2} (B_k\cap E_{j2})$ , we must prove that $A_{n_1}\cap A_{n_2}=\emptyset$ . We know that $\{E_{j1}\}_{j=1}^{n_1}$ is disjoint and that $F_1=\cup_{j=1}^{n_1} E_{j1}$ , moreover $\{E_{j2}\}_{j=1}^{n_2}$ is disjoint and that $F_2=\cup_{j=1}^{n_2} E_{j2}$ . Therefore, since $F_1\cap F_2=\emptyset$ , we have that $$\bigg[\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_1} (B_k\cap E_{j1})\bigg]\cap\bigg[ \bigcup_{j=1}^{n_2} (B_k\cap E_{j2})\bigg]=\emptyset,$$ hence $$\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{l=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l}(B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg)=\sum_{l=1}^{\infty}\nu\bigg(\bigcup_{j=1}^{n_l} (B_k\cap E_{jl})\bigg).$$ At this point we can use the finite additivity of $\nu$ , since the sequence $\{E_{jl}\}_{j=1}^{n_l}$ for each fixed $l\in\mathbb{N}$ is disjoint. Thus obtaining the thesis. It's correct? Thanks!","Proposition. Let a set, an elementary family such that and a measure on . Then exists a unique measure on the minimal algebra such that Proof.

42,Radon-Nikodym derivative of a finitely additive measure,Radon-Nikodym derivative of a finitely additive measure,,"I came across the following question asked in a prelims of UW. Let $(X,F,\mu)$ be a finite measure space, and $\lambda$ be a finitely-additive, non-negative, real valued set function on $F$ such that $$ \forall \epsilon >0, \exists \delta >0 : \mu(E)<\delta \implies \lambda(E)<\epsilon.$$ Show that there exists $g\in L^1(\mu)$ such that $$\lambda(E)=\int_E g d\mu.$$ The hypothesis clearly implies that $\lambda$ is absolutely continuous wrt $\mu.$ One therefore expects to invoke the Radon-Nikodym theorem. But, I know the Radon-Nikudym theorem to be tre only when $\lambda$ is also given to be a measure (I.e. countably additive). So, I tried mimicking the proof of Radon-Nikodym theorem, but I have a doubt in one step. We define $d\mu_1= d\lambda + d\mu$ . And, look at the linear functional $$f \to \int_X f d\lambda.$$ I can show that this is a bounded linear functional on $L^2(\mu_1).$ And, therefore we invoke Riesz representation theorem (?) to obtain a function $h\in L^2(\mu_1)$ such that $$\int_X f d\lambda=\int_X fh d\mu_1.$$ From this we obtain that $$\int_X f(1-h) d\lambda = \int_X fhd\mu.$$ After this step the usual procedure shows that $0\leq h\leq 1$ . And, the set on which $g=1$ is of measure 0 wrt $\mu$ and therefore wrt $\lambda.$ Replacing $f$ by $(1+h+...+h^n)f$ (We can do this because $h$ is bounded) and taking limit as $n\to \infty$ we obtain that $$\int_X f d\lambda = \int_X f \frac{h}{1-h}d\mu$$ which fives us the desired conclusion. I understand that $\mu$ being finite measure is not crucial but is helpful and simplifies things a bit. My confusion is that $d\mu_1$ is not an honest “measure” because it is only finitely additive. In this situation can we invoke RRT?  Secondly, should the assumption of finite additivity on $\lambda$ make our life easier?

Also assume that function $H(s)$ , $s\in  \mathbb{R}_+$ is measurable function (i.e. Borel measurable on $\mathbb{R}_+$ ). It is well-known that $A$ defines a signed measure and thus we can define Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral $Y(t):=\int_0^t H(s)dA(s)$ for any $t$ as long as $\int_0^t |H(s)|d|A|(s)<\infty$ . To prove that $Y(t)$ is right continuous, I choose a decreasing sequence $t_n\downarrow t$ and have $Y(t_n)=\int_{\mathbb{R}_+}1_{(0,t_n]}(s)H(s)dA(s)$ . We can see that for every fixed $s$ the integrand $1_{(0,t_n]}(s)H(s)$ tends to $1_{(0,t]}(s)H(s)$ .

Thank you!","Setup: Let $(M, \mathscr A, \mu)$ be a measure space. $u$ is a non-negative simple function if there exist non-negative real numbers $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_p$ and measurable sets $A_1,\ldots,A_p$ such that $u=\sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i 1_{A_i}$. The integral of a non-negative simple function $u$ is $\int u\, d\mu = \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i \mu(A_i)$. My question is about the definition of the integral for non-negative measurable functions. My professor defines it like this: Let $f: M \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ be an $\mathscr A$ measurable function and $(u_n)$ an increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions which converges pointwise to $f$: $u_n \uparrow f$. Then the integral of $f$ is defined by $$\int f \, d\mu = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \int u_n \, d\mu$$ Question: My professor remarks that the last definition is independent of the choice of the sequence of simple functions $(u_n)$ with $u_n \uparrow f$.

Let $\{q_n\}=\mathbb Q$, and let $f_n : \mathbb R \to [0,\infty)$ be a Borel measurable function with $\int f_n d\lambda=1$ and with support $[q_n-2^{-n-1},q_n+2^{-n-1}]$. $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure. We furthermore define a Borel measure $\mu$ by $\mu(A) := \int_A \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n d\lambda$. For the first part of this problem, I have already proven that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x) < \infty\ \mathrm{a.e}$, that $\mu <\!\!<\lambda$, and that every open subset of $\mathbb R$ has infinite $\mu$-measure. Now we are asked to show that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, and a I find myself fully at a loss to see how to do this.
