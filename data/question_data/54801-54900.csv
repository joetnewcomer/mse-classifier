0,Is there a general formula for the sum of a quadratic sequence?,Is there a general formula for the sum of a quadratic sequence?,,"I tried Googling ""formula for sum of quadratic sequence"", which did not give me anything useful. I just want an explicit formula for figuring out a sum for a quadratic sequence. For example, how would you figure out the sum of $2+6+12+20+\dots+210$? Can someone please help?

The differences between the terms are $4$, $6$, $8$, etc. The difference between the differences of the terms is $2$.
