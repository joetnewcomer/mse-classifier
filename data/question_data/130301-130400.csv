24,Explaining Horizontal Shifting and Scaling,Explaining Horizontal Shifting and Scaling,,"I always find myself wanting for a clear explanation (to a college algebra student) for the fact that horizontal transformations of graphs work in the opposite way that one might expect. For example, $f(x+1)$ is a horizontal shift to the left (a shift toward the negative side of the $x$-axis), whereas a cursory glance would cause one to suspect that adding a positive amount should shift in the positive direction. Similarly, $f(2x)$ causes the graph to shrink horizontally, not expand . I generally explain this by saying $x$ is getting a ""head start"". For example, suppose $f(x)$ has a root at $x = 5$. The graph of $f(x+1)$ is getting a unit for free, and so we only need $x = 4$ to get the same output before as before (i.e. a root). Thus, the root that used to be at $x=5$ is now at $x=4$, which is a shift to the left. My explanation seems to help some students and mystify others. I was hoping someone else in the community had an enlightening way to explain these phenomena.

I discovered this problem from chapter 3 of Prelude to Mathematics by W. W. Sawyer. Sawyer thought that this problem arose from the sine law: let $a,b,c$ be respectively the lengths of the edges opposite to three vertices $A,B,C$ of a triangle. Define $x=\cos A$ and define $y,z$ analogously. Now equalities $(1)-(3)$ simply relate $a,b$ and $c$ to each other by the cosines of the angles and $(4)$ is just a rewrite of the sine law $$ \frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}. $$ However, the algebraic version $(4)$ looks more general. For example, it does not state that $a,b,c$ must be positive or that they must satisfy the triangle inequality. Sawyer wrote that this isn't a hard problem, but he didn't provide any solution. I can prove $(4)$ using linear algebra. Suppose that $(a,b,c)\ne(0,0,0)$ (otherwise $(4)$ is obvious). Rewrite $(1)-(3)$ in the form of $M\mathbf a=0$ : $$\begin{bmatrix}-1&z&y\\ z&-1&x\\ y&x&-1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a\\ b\\ c\end{bmatrix}=0.$$ Since $x^2,y^2,z^2\ne1$ , $M$ has rank $2$ and $D=\operatorname{adj}(M)$ has rank $1$ . Hence all columns of $D$ are parallel to $(a,b,c)^T$ and $\frac{d_{11}}{d_{21}}=\frac{d_{12}}{d_{22}}=\frac{a}{b}$ . Since $M$ is symmetric, $D$ is symmetric too. Therefore $\frac{1-x^2}{1-y^2}=\frac{d_{11}}{d_{22}}=\frac{d_{11}d_{12}}{d_{21}d_{22}}=\frac{a^2}{b^2}$ , i.e. $\frac{a^2}{1-x^2}=\frac{b^2}{1-y^2}$ .

37,Moriarty's calculator: some bizarre and deceptive graphical anomalies,Moriarty's calculator: some bizarre and deceptive graphical anomalies,,"Background: This is a problem I first came across a few years ago in a calculus textbook (a James Stewart one), where it addressed some of the pitfalls of using graphing calculators. The original context addressed issues with the TI-83 calculator, but seeing as that most people use the vaunted TI-89 nowadays, I thought I would consider some issues with that one. My first few considerations proved to be simple to handle (and I will outline them below), but there is one that I have no idea how to address properly. I think it is sufficiently bizarre so as to call the challenge problem Moriarty's Enigma. Necessary information: The TI-89 Guidebook gives information on how the calculator draws objects given the screen dimensions of the calculator. Screen dimensions for all TI graphing calculators may be found here . The relevant information from the guidebook may be found here (link provided so as not to make an already long post even longer). The main point is that the graphing window is $159$ pixels wide and we want to start with $x=0$ and $x=2\pi$ (the reason for this will become very clear in a moment). Since there are $158$ ""gaps"" between pixels, the distance between pixels is $\frac{2\pi-0}{158}$. Thus, the $x$-values that the calculator actually plots are $x=0+\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n$, where $n=0,1,2,\ldots,158$. Elementary, my dear TI-89: First consider the graph of $y=\sin(161x)$, which is graphed below in dot mode on the window $0\leq x\leq 2\pi, -1.5\leq y\leq 1.5$ (this will be the window used in all examples so that my results will be reproducible by other users if desired): Now consider when the functions $y=\pm\sin(3x)$ are graphed simultaneously in square mode: It certainly looks as if $\sin(161x)=\pm\sin(3x)$. This actually makes sense in terms of the pixel information noted earlier: for $y=\sin(161x)$, the actual points plotted by the calculator are $\left(\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n,\sin\left(161\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\right)$ for $n=0,1,2,\ldots,158$. But \begin{align} \sin\left(161\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right) &= \sin\left(158\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n+3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\\[1em]   &= \sin(2\pi n)\cos\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)+\sin\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right)\cos(2\pi n)\quad\text{[$\sin(\alpha+\beta)$]}\\[1em]   &= \pm\sin\left(3\cdot\frac{2\pi}{158}\cdot n\right),\qquad n=0,1,\ldots,158 \end{align} Thus, the $y$-values, and hence the points, plotted for $y=\sin(161x)$ lie on either $y=\sin(3x)$ or $-\sin(3x)$, as confirmed by the previous graph. The same reasoning can be used to show that all of the $y$-values for $\sin(158x)$ are plotted as zero: At this point, I was feeling confident about my ability to understand and detect graphing anomalies for trigonometric functions due to periodicity and the like, but the next function has thus far thwarted my analysis completely. Moriarty's Enigma: Graph $\sin(77x)$ in line mode: I can deduce how $\pm\sin(2x)$ comes into the mix (similar to the $\sin(161x)$ example), but I cannot see how $\pm\cos(2x)$ fits in. The $y$-values for $\sin(161x)$ seem to be a mixture of $\pm\sin(2x),\pm\cos(2x)$, and an array of different trigonometric functions. Here is the graph when all five functions are plotted simultaneously ($\sin(77x)$ plotted in line mode while $\pm\sin(2x),\pm\cos(2x)$ in square mode): As if that were not weird enough, graph $\sin(77x)$ and $\pm\sin(81x)$ in line mode: Finally, graph $\sin(77x)$ and $\cos(77x)$ in line mode: What other functions might be hidden in $\sin(77x)$ when graphing on the window $0\leq x\leq 2\pi, -1.5\leq y\leq 1.5$ for the TI-89?

I attempted this question and failed in two different ways. 1) I considered a polynomial $p(x) = x^3+ x + 1 - m^2$ (for some natural $m$) and factorized the polynomial assuming $2^n$ is a root. I, then, tried substituting some numbers to get a contradiction in divisibility (since $x - 2^n$ is a factor). Alas, all of that was in vain. 2) I wrote $2^{3n} + 2^n + 1 = m^2$ and thus $(m-1)(m+1) = 2^n(2^{2n} + 1)$. So one can conclude that if $xy = 2^{2n} + 1$ such that $(x,y) = 1$, then one of the $m-1$ or $m+1$ must be $2^{n-1}x$ and the other must be $2y$ (this follows from the fact that $m$ is odd and $(m-1,m+1) = 2$).

Attempt at Geometric Proof I discovered something that might be useful.  Construct  the points $E$ and $G$ outside $\triangle ABC$ so that $\triangle EBA$ and $\triangle GAC$ are similar to $\triangle ABC$ (see the figure below).  Clearly, $EAG$ is a straight line parallel to $BC$ .  Let $F$ and $H$ be the points corresponding to $D$ in $\triangle EBA$ and $\triangle GAC$ , respectively (that is, $\angle FAB=\angle DCB=\angle HCA$ and $\angle FAE=\angle DCA=\angle HCG$ ). Then $\triangle FBD$ and $\triangle HDC$ are isosceles triangles similar to $\triangle ABC$ , and $\square AFDH$ is a parallelogram.  I haven't been able to do anything further than this without trigonometry. Here is a bit more attempt.  If $M$ is the reflection of $A$ wrt $BC$ , then through the use of trigonometric version of Ceva's thm, I can prove that $\angle AMD=42^\circ$ and $\angle CMD=18^\circ$ .  Not sure how to prove this with just geometry.  But this result may be useful.  (Although we can use law of sines on $\triangle MCD$ to get $MD$ and then use law of cosines on $\triangle BMD$ to get $BD$ in terms of $AB$ too.  But this is still a heavily trigonometric solution, even if the algebra is less complicated than the one I wrote above.) I have a few more observations.  They may be useless.  Let $D'$ be the point obtained by reflecting $D$ across the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ .  Draw a regular pentagon $ADKK'D'$ .  Geogebra tells me that $\angle ABK=54^\circ$ and $\angle AKB=48^\circ$ .  This can be proven using trigonometry, although a geometric proof should exist.  But it is easy to show that $KD\perp CD$ and $K'D'\perp BD'$ .

Now he divided $x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1$ by $x^2 - 4x + 5$. The quotient was $x + 1$ and the remainder $x - 6$. Now since $\rm dividend = quotient\cdot divisor + remainder$, he concluded that $x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x - 1 = x-6$ since the divisor is $0$. Plugging $2 + i$ into $x - 6$, we get $-4 + i$. But my question is, how was he able to divide by zero in the first place? Why did dividing by zero work in this case?","Today, I was at a class.

99,Purpose of Inverse Functions,Purpose of Inverse Functions,,"Finding inverse functions and understanding their properties is fairly basic within mathematics. During my studies it was found fairly simple and easy to comprehend that it was a swapping of the outputs and inputs of a function. But now it has reappeared in calculus as finding the derivative of inverse functions and has me thinking  what is the actual real world application of inverses.Like how studying quadratics is extremely useful in modeling objects in free fall. I know my question may seem trivial to many here, i'm a high school student and we never get to have these discussions in class.","Finding inverse functions and understanding their properties is fairly basic within mathematics.
