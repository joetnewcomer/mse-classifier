0,Proving a set of $2\times 3$ matrices is a manifold?,Proving a set of  matrices is a manifold?,2\times 3,"The way I have always been told to check if something is a manifold (I haven't had a whole lot of experience with them), is to check if the derivative of the function representing the loci of the graph satisfies the implicit function theorem. For example, the circle is a manifold because it can be expressed as $F(x,y)=x^2+y^2-1=0$ and this has a derivative of $D_F=[2x\  2y]$ which satisfies the implicit function theorem since it is onto. However, how could one show something more abstract is a manifold? Specifically, how can you show (even just hints are fine) that the set of all 2x3 matrices with rank one (subset of $\text{Mat}(2, 3)$) form a manifold in $\mathbb{R}^4$? Also, the notion of manifold for me I think is properly called an embedded submanifold or something of the sort","The way I have always been told to check if something is a manifold (I haven't had a whole lot of experience with them), is to check if the derivative of the function representing the loci of the graph satisfies the implicit function theorem.

The most I know right now is the following: $x=r\cos(\theta)$ $y=r\sin(\theta)$ $dA=r\,dr\,d\theta$ $D=\{(x,y)\mid x^2+y^2\leq 25\}$ or $D=\{(r,\theta)\mid r\leq 5\}$ It's given in the problem that $r=5$, so that's a start. I'm assuming then that my limits for $r$ is $0\leq r\leq 5$. But I have no idea how to define the limits for $\theta$. My guess would be $0\leq\theta\leq 2\pi$, but several examples with different regions seem to use $0\leq\theta\leq\pi$. So here's part of the integral with missing limits on $\theta$: $$\int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta}\int\limits_{0}^{5}r^3\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}\,dr\,d\theta$$ Is my limited understanding correct so far? How do I fill in the holes of this problem? I know how to integrate after I have the proper limits; I just don't know how to define the limits given the information I have.",,"['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates']"

96,How do I find the volume of this sliced cylinder?,How do I find the volume of this sliced cylinder?,,"This is hard to explain but I'll do my best.  I hope I'm clear. Imagine you have a donut.  You want to find the volume of it and the method you want to use is to imagine slicing one side of that donut and opening it out into a cylinder.  Only, it's not exactly a cylinder as it has two pointed ends: one side of the cylinder has the length of the inner circumference of the donut, the other side has the length of the outer circumference. The 'middle part' is a simple cylinder. I want to find the volume of each end part. There's an easy trick to it, but that's not the solution I'm looking for; the easy trick being putting the two end parts together to make a smaller cylinder. But, how I want to do this is to find the volume of one of these pointy cylindrical endparts with an integral.  However, I can't seem to hit the right answer. Let's say my stretched out donut has a left side of length $2\pi(R-r)$ and a right side of length $2\pi(R+r)$ and a radius of $r$.  Let's say I slice the top and bottom pointed end parts off.  I now have the middle part, a cylinder with a radius of $r$ and a height of $2\pi(R-r)$ and two pointed endparts.  Each endpart has a radius of $r$, and a height of $2\pi r$. If I cut an endpart into triangle wedge-shaped cross sections, each wedge will have a length of $2\sqrt{r^2-y^2}$, a height of $2\pi\sqrt{r^2-y^2}$ and a depth of $dy$.  So the volume of each wedge is $2\pi(r^2-y^2)dy$ If I integrate this with limits $-r$ and $r$ I get $2\pi\int_{-r}^r (r^2-y^2)dy = 2\pi (4r^3/3)$ Assuming that's right, I can double that and add it to the volume of my cylinder to get the donut volume.  So: $4\pi (\frac{4r^3}{3}) + 2\pi^2r^2(R-r) = \frac{16\pi r^3}{3} + 2\pi^2 r^2(R-r)$ The volume of the donut is actually $2\pi^2 r^2R$ (using the solid of revolution approach) so looks like I picked up some extra dough somewhere... $16\pi \frac{r^3}{3} - 2\pi^2 r^3$ cubic units of extra dough to be precise.
