1,Counting coupons in a box,Counting coupons in a box,,"I have a question with regards to counting. I come from a background in quantum computing, so I'm not familiar with the relevant literature here. For the interested reader, I provide below more details about the quantum computing background and how I arrived at this problem. The ""counting"" question I want to solve is: Suppose a box has $N$ distinct coupons numbered $1,2,\dotsc,N$ . Each turn, I randomly pick one coupon from the box, look at the number on the coupon, and then put it back in the box. My goal is to estimate the total number $N$ . Approximately how many times should I draw a coupon from the box and then put back, such that I get a reasonably good estimate of $N$ with a reasonably high probability? If you want to be rigorous, after $M$ turns, what is the probability $$P\left(\frac{|N_{\text{estimate}}-N|}{N} <\epsilon\right)?$$ Now, for the background: quantum annealers are used to reach the ground state of a desired Hamiltonian. I want to count the number of ground states of this Hamiltonian. I do this by repeatedly measuring the wave function, which is like randomly picking a coupon from a box, as in the above problem. I have ideas to ensure that each coupon is picked with equal probability (called ""fair sampling"").","I have a question with regards to counting.

2,Combinatorics problem (deck of cards),Combinatorics problem (deck of cards),,"I'd be extremely thankful if someone could help me with this. A company makes decks of $50$ cards. There are $40$ ""regular"" cards, that always come in a certain order, and $10$ ""special"" cards that don't have a particular order and also they are interspersed between the deck. (Note the $40$ regular cards don't always come one after the other, they just always follow the same order) In how many different combinations could the deck come? My thinking (which apparently is wrong) was to say well, I'll choose $10$ out of the $50$ possible places and multiply that by $10!$ which is the number of ways I can shuffle the special cards. So $$ \binom{50}{10} \cdot 10! . $$ And that would be it since the regular cards will always be positioned in a certain order.  But the answer key says $$\binom{n+k-1}{n} = \binom{49}{10}\cdot 10! = \frac{49!}{39!}.$$ Any clue why instead of picking $10$ out of $50$ it picks $10$ out of $49$ ?

(b) with no child getting greater than or equal to $2$ teddy bears? (c) with each child getting only $3$ goodies? \ My work/attempts: I'm pretty confident with my first two responses... (a) Since the teddy bears are distinct there are $4^3$ ways to distribute them to four children. Meanwhile, since the lollipops are identical, we can consider them as dots and the $4$ children having $3$ slashes to separate them. We then can use the choose function to determine the number of ways to distribute them: ${9+3\choose 3}$ = ${12\choose 3}$ ways. Therefore there are $4^3{12\choose 3}$ outcomes. (b) Since the children can not get greater than or equal to $2$ bears we will assume there is no repetition of the bears. Thus rather than having $4^3$ ways to distribute the distinct bears to the 4 children, there will be $4$ x $3$ x $2$ ways to distribute the bears (or 4!). Again the lollipops are identical so we still have ${12\choose 3}$ to distribute these to the 4 children. Thus our number of outcomes for this case is 4! ${12\choose 3}$ .

Suppose we sequentially touch every lamp in column $C1$ . This turns on all lamps in each row (and since they are not affected by consequent moves remain on). The lamps in the column will eventually all be on too because they are affected an odd number of times. Thus we have a strategy taking $n$ moves.

I have taken a look around, but never succeeded in the task of finding an actual solution. Also, the colleague who proposed it to me did not know himself how to solve it either.) At first, I thought a simple construction would suffice: namely, one relatively 'naive' idea is to consider products of the form $$ (x^{\alpha_1} - 1)(x^{\alpha_2} -1) \cdots (x^{\alpha_k} -1),$$ where $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \cdots + \alpha_k = n.$ Indeed, this works and yields a non-trivial result through an algorithmic method, but only when $k \lesssim \ln(n).$ One can improve $\ln(n)$ slightly in the construction - which is not at all sophisticated -, but not so that one can reach the $n^{1/2}/\ln(n)^{1/2}$ type of upper bound, which is asked. Therefore, I guess the 'hint' here is that we should not be looking for a 'constructive' proof, but rather for an 'existence' one. Therefore, with that in mind, we write our desired polynomial as $$P(x) = \sum_{a \in A} x^a - \sum_{b \in B} x^b.$$ Then, $(x-1)^k$ dividing $P$ means that $P(1) = P'(1) = \cdots = P^{(k-1)}(1) = 0.$ But this implies, after some manipulations, that $$ \sum_{a \in A} 1 = \sum_{b \in B} 1, $$ $$ \sum_{a \in A} a = \sum_{b \in B} b, $$ $$ \sum_{a \in A} a^2 = \sum_{b \in B} b^2,$$  $$ \vdots $$  $$ \sum_{a \in A} a^{k-1} = \sum_{b \in B} b^{k-1}.$$ Let then $s_k(A) = \sum_{a \in A} a^k,$ where $A \subset \{0,1,...,n\}.$ The problem can therefore be restated as follows: There are two subsets $A,B \subset \{0,1,...,n\}$ such that $|A| = |B|$ and $s_j(A) = s_j(B), \,j=1,...,k-1.$ Notice that $A$ and $B$ need not necessarily be disjoint, as any possible overlap is 'cancelled' in the definition of $P.$ In order to solve this problem, I have been trying to use continuity arguments, like 'keep the sum unchanged by changing two elements, and the difference between the squares decreases' or something of this kind. This might indeed be helpful, but I cannot see how to take it on further than that, that is, how to use this construction for $k > 2.$","Recently, I came across the following problem: It is known that $k$ and $n$ are positive integers, and that $k+1 \le  \sqrt{\frac{n+1}{\ln(n+1)}}.$ Prove that we can find a polynomial $P$ of degree $n$, whose coefficients belong to $\{-1,0,1\},$ such that $(x-1)^k$ divides $P$ ( Some background: This was proposed to me by a colleague, who stated it was from an Ukrainian IMO team selection test.

Therefore, with that in mind, we write our desired polynomial as $$P(x) = \sum_{a \in A} x^a - \sum_{b \in B} x^b.$$ Then, $(x-1)^k$ dividing $P$ means that $P(1) = P'(1) = \cdots = P^{(k-1)}(1) = 0.$ But this implies, after some manipulations, that $$ \sum_{a \in A} 1 = \sum_{b \in B} 1, $$ $$ \sum_{a \in A} a = \sum_{b \in B} b, $$ $$ \sum_{a \in A} a^2 = \sum_{b \in B} b^2,$$  $$ \vdots $$  $$ \sum_{a \in A} a^{k-1} = \sum_{b \in B} b^{k-1}.$$ Let then $s_k(A) = \sum_{a \in A} a^k,$ where $A \subset \{0,1,...,n\}.$ The problem can therefore be restated as follows: There are two subsets $A,B \subset \{0,1,...,n\}$ such that $|A| = |B|$ and $s_j(A) = s_j(B), \,j=1,...,k-1.$ Notice that $A$ and $B$ need not necessarily be disjoint, as any possible overlap is 'cancelled' in the definition of $P.$ In order to solve this problem, I have been trying to use continuity arguments, like 'keep the sum unchanged by changing two elements, and the difference between the squares decreases' or something of this kind. This might indeed be helpful, but I cannot see how to take it on further than that, that is, how to use this construction for $k > 2.$",,"['combinatorics', 'polynomials', 'contest-math']"

Hint: $a_{n,k}$ is the coefficient of $x^{2n-k}$ in the power series expansion of $\frac{(1+x)^n}{(1-x)^{k+1}}-(1+x)^n$.  ] 2nd EDIT: here is my tentative proof with details (is it   correct?):\begin{align*}a_{n,k}&=\sum_{j= k+1}^{2n}{j\choose k}{n\choose j-n}\\ & =\sum_{j= k}^{2n}{j\choose k}{n\choose 2n-j}-{n\choose 2n-k}\\ &=\sum_{j= 0}^{2n-k}{j+k\choose k}{n\choose 2n-k-j}-{n\choose 2n-k}\end{align*} On the other hand, it is well   known that: $\sum_{g\ge0}{g+k\choose k}x^g=(1-x)^{-k-1}$ and   $\sum_{g\ge0}{n\choose g}x^g=(1+x)^n$, so that:   $$\frac{(1+x)^n}{(1-x)^{k+1}} -(1+x)^n = \sum_{h \ge 0} \sum_{g= 0}^{h}{g+k\choose k}{n\choose h-g}x^h -\sum_{h \ge 0}{n\choose h}x^h $$  Then  $$[[x^{2n-k}]]\left(\frac{(1+x)^n}{(1-x)^{k+1}} -(1+x)^n \right) = a_{n,k} $$ Then, reducing modulo $2$:   $$[[x^{2n-k}]]\left((1-x)^{n-k-1} -(1+x)^n \right) \equiv a_{n,k} \pmod 2.$$ There are two cases: $\circ$ If $k+1\le n$  then $2n-k \ge n +1$, hence $2n-k > n $  and    $2n-k > n -k-1 \ge 0 $, hence:   \begin{align*} a_{n,k}&\equiv (-1)^k {n-k-1\choose 2n-k} -{n\choose 2n-k} \pmod 2 \\ &\equiv 0-0=0\pmod 2.\end{align*}  $\circ$ If $0 > n-k-1$ , then:   \begin{align*}  a_{n,k}&\equiv  {k-n+2n-k\choose 2n-k} -{n\choose 2n-k} \pmod 2 \\ &\equiv {n\choose 2n-k} -{n\choose 2n-k}=0\pmod 2.\end{align*} (ii) Give an explicit expression for $a_{n,k}$. I know that \begin{align*}\sum_{j= k}^{n}{j\choose k}{n\choose j} =2^{n-k}{n\choose k}\end{align*} and I would expect some similar expression for $a_{n,k}$, but that does not seem to be straightforward.

Let $D$ be the collection of all $X$'s duads. Call a partition of $X$ into duads a syntheme .

In general, $S_{2n}$ acts transitively on the set of synthemes with point-stabilizer an internal wreath product $\mathbb{Z}_2\wr S_n$, which means the number of synthemes will be $(2n)!/(2^n n!)$. Question I . What is the number $t(n)$ of synthematic totals as a function of $n$? (The terms duad, syntheme and total come from Sylvester IIRC.) We see $t(1)=1$ and $t(2)=1$ by inspection. One can derive $t(3)=6$ with some geometric reasoning; see John Baez's webpage write-up or Peter Cameron's blog post . The story behind $t(3)=6$ is that of the construction of the (unique) outer automorphism of $S_6$.

Recall every $G$-set is a disjoint union of orbits, and the isomorphism type (as a $G$-set) of an orbit is determined by the conjugacy class of its point-stabilizers, which allows us to completely (if abstractly) characterize a group action. The $n=3$ case also gives rise to the so-called Tutte-Coxeter graph, so: Bonus question I : Do higher values of $n$ yield additional exotic incidence structures?

In the case of $n=4$, one of the orbits is in bijection with the set of distinct Fano planes.

The set of vectors thus corresponds to a set of synthemes which happens to be a synthematic total. The totals that can be achieved in this way correspond to the conjugacy class of this copy of $\mathbb{F}_2^3$ sitting inside $S_8$.

91,"Different combinations of 7 books distributed to 7 critics, twice","Different combinations of 7 books distributed to 7 critics, twice",,"I'm having an exam on Discrete Mathematics II in my university, and I came up to this problem. A publishing firm has 7 books ready to publish. Each of them needs to be reviewed by 2 different critics, so the firm hires 7 critics.   In the first week, each book is distributed to a critic, then in the second week, the books are rearranged.   In how many ways can we arrange the books so that no critic receives the same book twice? I thought the question was straightforwardly asking for me to apply the perturbation formula for successive combinations. So I wrote down the solutions as: $Dn = n!(1-\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}-...+(-1)^n\frac{1}{n!})$ and applied for $n=7$. My problem is that this feels wrong . I never used the information that our critics are 7 in number, or that the reviews needed are two. What would happen if each book needed 3 or 4 reviews? The result of the formula would obviously need to be smaller, but there's only one variable used in it. Any help would be extremely appreciated.","I'm having an exam on Discrete Mathematics II in my university, and I came up to this problem. A publishing firm has 7 books ready to publish.
