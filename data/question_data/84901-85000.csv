3,Reference request for the existence of Sobolev traces on Lipschitz domains,Reference request for the existence of Sobolev traces on Lipschitz domains,,"Let $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb R^d$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain.

41,The Banach space $c_0$ is $C^{\infty}$-smooth.,The Banach space  is -smooth.,c_0 C^{\infty},"In this paper , J. Eells defines this notion of $C^r$ -smoothness for Banach spaces: A Banach space $E$ is $C^r$ -smooth, $r \geq 0$ , if there exists a nontrivial (that is, nonzero) $C^r$ function $\phi : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with bounded (not necessarily compact) support. He then claims that the Banach space $$c_0 = \{~(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots) : \lim a_n = 0~\},~~\|(a_n)\|_{c_0} = \sup_n |a_n|,$$ is $C^{\infty}$ -smooth.

Now, given $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $c_0$ , define: $$\Phi\big((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\big) = \large\prod_{n = 1}^{\infty} \phi(a_n).$$ Note that the product is well-defined, since the terms $a_n$ are eventually all within $[-1/4, 1/4]$ , and hence almost all terms in the product are equal to $1$ . Moreover, this function has bounded support, since if $\|(a_n)\|_{c_0} > 1$ , then at least one $a_n$ has to be greater than $1$ in modulus, and then the whole product is zero.

Here is a slimmed down version of his proof: By his theorem 1.14, X has a balanced local base $\{V_n\}$ such that $V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} + V_{n+1} \subset V_n$.

Then there is only one topology on $F$ and jointly continuous just means that the inner product is continuous. Question 1: Is that correct so far? So to show that $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is continuous we need to show that if $(x_n, y_n) \to (x,y) $ then $\langle x_n, y_n \rangle \to \langle x, y \rangle$ in $\mathbb R$. On $V \times V$ we can define the norm $\|(a,b)\| = \max(\|a\|, \|b\|)$. Question 2: How do I show that this norm induces the same topology as the product topology? Now I want to show that for $\varepsilon > 0$ there is an $N$ such that for $n > N$, $| \langle x_n, y_n \rangle - \langle x, y \rangle | < \varepsilon$. In the max norm, I have $\|x_n - x\|^2 = \langle x_n, x_n \rangle - \langle x_n, x \rangle - \langle x, x_n \rangle + \langle x, x \rangle < \varepsilon^2$, for both $x_n,x$ and $y_n,y$. Question 3: How can I use this to show $| \langle x_n, y_n \rangle - \langle x, y \rangle | < \varepsilon$?",,"['functional-analysis', 'inner-products']"

I think I made some mistake but could not recognize. Could you have a check on my attempt? Consider the map $\varphi:E' \to \mathbb R, f \mapsto \langle \mu, f_{\mid K} \rangle$ . It's clear that $f$ is linear. Let $B_E$ be the closed unit ball of $E$ . Because $K$ is weakly compact, $K$ is bounded. There is $r>0$ such that $rK \subset B_E$ .

Assume $p\in \overline I$ and $p^2=p$. Show: $p\in I$. Can someone give me a little hint how to solve this, please?",,"['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'ideals', 'banach-algebras']"
99,If $f(x)$ is close to $0$ then necessarily $x$ is close to $\ker f$?,If  is close to  then necessarily  is close to ?,f(x) 0 x \ker f,"Suppose that $X$ is a real Banach space and $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous linear functional. Is it true that for any $\varepsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that for any $x \in X$ we have: $$|f(x)|<\delta \Rightarrow (\exists z \in \ker f) (\Vert x-z \Vert <\varepsilon).$$ This is certainly true if $X=\mathbb{R}^n$. I suspect this might be false for infinite-dimensional $X$, but I haven´t been able to find a counterexample. Thanks!","Suppose that $X$ is a real Banach space and $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous linear functional.
