0,Prove $| \sum_{i \leq n} \frac{\mu(i)}{i} | \leq 1$,Prove,| \sum_{i \leq n} \frac{\mu(i)}{i} | \leq 1,"So I am trying to prove the above stated formula. I am completely new to number theory so I thank you in advance for baring with me. I start off by using the definition: $\frac{\phi(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|n} \frac{\mu(d)}{d}$ Where $\phi$ is Eulers function, and $\mu$ is the Mobius mu function. From here, I use the Mobius inversion formula to give: $\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|n}d\frac{\phi(\frac{n}{d})}{n}\mu(d)$ Now summing $n$ up to $x$: $\sum_{n \leq x}\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{n \leq x}\sum_{d|n}d\frac{\phi(\frac{n}{d})}{n}\mu(d)$ Now I'm not fully sure on how I can rearrange things inside the two summations on the right hand side, so leaving things as they are; using that $\sum_{d|n} \mu(d) = 1$, if and only if $n =1$. Hence: $\sum_{n \leq x}\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \sum_{d|1}d\phi(\frac{1}{d})\mu(d)$ Thus $d=1$. Subbing this in: $\sum_{n \leq x}\frac{\mu(n)}{n} = \phi(1) = 1$ I am not sure what I have missed (or done wrong) as to have an equality and not a triangle relation. Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated","So I am trying to prove the above stated formula. I am completely new to number theory so I thank you in advance for baring with me.

1,$p=k n+1$ prime,prime,p=k n+1,"This is a part of the question from CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) Chapter on FFT and Polynomials. I am self reading and am stuck at this part.

Is $V(\Bbb Z/p\Bbb Z)$ a standard notation in algebraic number theory? Does it mean a variety restricted to the integers mod $p$? If not, what does it mean / could it mean in this context? Context: I attended a lecture recently on Strong Approximation in number theory. The speaker began by talking about Markoff's surface $$x^2+y^2+z^2-3xyz=0,$$ and told us about a group $\Gamma$ which generates the integral solutions of this equation. He then made a conjecture, which didn't seem to be tied to Markoff's surface in particular: Conjecture: The action of $\Gamma$ on $X(\Bbb Z_p)$ has precisely two orbits, one of which is $\{0\}$. After digging around online, I found notes for another talk he had given.

Then we have $${{p_1}^{\alpha_1}}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} = N = \prod_{i=1}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \frac{3}{2}{p_i}^{\alpha_i}\sigma({p_i}^{\alpha_i}) < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{2\alpha_1}},$$ from which it follows that $$\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_2}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{\alpha_1}}.$$ But we also have $${p_2}^{\Omega(N) - {\alpha_1}} = \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_2}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{\alpha_1}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_2}^{\alpha_1}} < {{p_2}^{\alpha_1 + 1}},$$ from which we obtain $$\frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2} < \alpha_1.$$ Note that we have obtained the result: ""If $$N = {p_1}^{2\alpha_1}{q^k}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N) - 1}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}}$$ is an odd (positive integer) with $\frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2} < \alpha_1,$ then $N$ is ${\it not}$ perfect."" Taking the contrapositive of the result we have obtained, we have: ""If  $$N = {p_1}^{2\alpha_1}{q^k}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N) - 1}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}}$$ is an odd perfect number with smallest prime factor $p_1$ and Euler prime $q$, then $\alpha_1 \leq \frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2}$."" Somebody, please tell me that I ${\it did}$ make a logical error somewhere -- I am finding it increasingly hard to spot my own mistakes these days.  =( Thank you!",,"['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'inequality', 'open-problem', 'functional-inequalities']"

Odd numbers with more than two prime factors will in general be expressable as the difference of multiple pairs of squares (cubes of primes are one exception; I don't know whether there are others).  If we know the factors of d, we can generate all of the the pairs of numbers whose squares differ by d.  My question is, if we do not know the factors of d, are there algorithms for generating pairs of numbers whose squares differ by d?",,['number-theory']

The residual degree of $v_i$ over $v$ is $f_i =  [ \Sigma_{v_i} : \Sigma_{v} ]$ The following formula relating the ramification indices $e_i$, the residual degrees $f_i$, the number $m$ of extensions of $v$ to $F$, and the degree $n$ of $F / K$ holds: $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m} e_i f_i = n $$ Now the question: Suppose that $p$ factors in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ as $$ p = \epsilon \pi^n $$ where $\epsilon$ is unit in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and $\pi$ is an irreducible element in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$. Part 1: I want to show that $F = K(\pi)$ (that is, $\pi$ is a primitive element for $F/K$).  To do this, it suffices to show the minimal polynomial of  $\pi$ over $K$,  $$ \phi(X) = X^k + a_{k-1}X^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0 \qquad (a_i \in K), $$ has degree $n$.  Of course, $k \leq n$. Alex Bartel has offered a solution below, but I don't understand some of the details.  Here is my understanding of his argument.  By definition,  $$ 0 = \phi(\pi) = \pi^k + a_{k-1}\pi^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0 $$ On the left, for every $i$, $v_i(\phi(\pi)) = v_i(0) = \infty$.  On the right, $v_i(\pi^k) = k$, $v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j}) = v_i(a_{j}) + j = nv(a_j) + j$ for $j=0, \ldots, k-1$, and so $$ v_i(\phi(\pi)) \geq \min(v_i(\pi^k), v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j})) = \min(k, nv(a_j) + j) $$ where $j$ ranges from $0$ to $k-1$.  If $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$, then equality holds in the last displayed equation, which contradicts that the left-hand side is infinite.  Alex asserts that $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$ holds if $k < n$, meaning $k < n$ is impossible.  I do not understand why this assertion should be ture Part 2: I also want to show that the minimal polynomial of $\pi$ over $K$, $$ \phi(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \qquad (a_i \in K), $$ is Eisenstein with respect to $v$ (that is, $v(a_{i}) > 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$ and $v(a_0) = 1$ [I think this is what Eisenstein with respect to $v$ means]). Based on the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m} e_i f_i = n$, I know that $v$ has only one extension to $F$, $v_1$, with $e_1 = n$, $f_1 = 1$, and irreducible element $\pi_1 = \pi$.  So $\pi$ is the unique irreducible element of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and every nonzero element $\alpha$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ factors as $$ \alpha = \epsilon \pi^{a} $$ for some unit $\epsilon$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and some $a \geq 0$.  Since the quotient field of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ is $F$, any nonzero $\alpha$ in $F$ can be expressed as above if we allow  $a$ to range through the integers. That is where I am stuck.

The residual degree of $v_i$ over $v$ is $f_i =  [ \Sigma_{v_i} : \Sigma_{v} ]$ The following formula relating the ramification indices $e_i$, the residual degrees $f_i$, the number $m$ of extensions of $v$ to $F$, and the degree $n$ of $F / K$ holds: $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m} e_i f_i = n $$ Now the question: Suppose that $p$ factors in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ as $$ p = \epsilon \pi^n $$ where $\epsilon$ is unit in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and $\pi$ is an irreducible element in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$. Part 1: I want to show that $F = K(\pi)$ (that is, $\pi$ is a primitive element for $F/K$).  To do this, it suffices to show the minimal polynomial of  $\pi$ over $K$,  $$ \phi(X) = X^k + a_{k-1}X^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0 \qquad (a_i \in K), $$ has degree $n$.  Of course, $k \leq n$. Alex Bartel has offered a solution below, but I don't understand some of the details.  Here is my understanding of his argument.  By definition,  $$ 0 = \phi(\pi) = \pi^k + a_{k-1}\pi^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0 $$ On the left, for every $i$, $v_i(\phi(\pi)) = v_i(0) = \infty$.  On the right, $v_i(\pi^k) = k$, $v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j}) = v_i(a_{j}) + j = nv(a_j) + j$ for $j=0, \ldots, k-1$, and so $$ v_i(\phi(\pi)) \geq \min(v_i(\pi^k), v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j})) = \min(k, nv(a_j) + j) $$ where $j$ ranges from $0$ to $k-1$.  If $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$, then equality holds in the last displayed equation, which contradicts that the left-hand side is infinite.  Alex asserts that $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$ holds if $k < n$, meaning $k < n$ is impossible.  I do not understand why this assertion should be ture Part 2: I also want to show that the minimal polynomial of $\pi$ over $K$, $$ \phi(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \qquad (a_i \in K), $$ is Eisenstein with respect to $v$ (that is, $v(a_{i}) > 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$ and $v(a_0) = 1$ [I think this is what Eisenstein with respect to $v$ means]). Based on the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m} e_i f_i = n$, I know that $v$ has only one extension to $F$, $v_1$, with $e_1 = n$, $f_1 = 1$, and irreducible element $\pi_1 = \pi$.  So $\pi$ is the unique irreducible element of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and every nonzero element $\alpha$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ factors as $$ \alpha = \epsilon \pi^{a} $$ for some unit $\epsilon$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and some $a \geq 0$.  Since the quotient field of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ is $F$, any nonzero $\alpha$ in $F$ can be expressed as above if we allow  $a$ to range through the integers. That is where I am stuck. I would like to solve this problem in the language of valuations as I am studying from Borevich and Shafarevich, and this is the language they use. I would appreciate some help with this.",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"
