These squares are coloured with four colours so that every row and every column has $25$ squares   of each colour. Prove that there are $2$ rows and $2$ columns such that their $4$ intersections are painted with different colors. My attempt: I first counted number of pairs $\mathcal P$ $(r_1,r_2)$ such that $r_1,r_2$ belongs to same row, but different in colour. This can be done in $$\binom 42\times25\times 25$$ ways. So, in $100$ rows, this number is $$100\times\binom 42\times25\times 25$$ Now, we can find a pair of columns in $$\binom{100}2$$ ways. So, by Pigeonhole Principle, we can find at least a pair of columns containing $$\left\lceil\frac{100\times\binom 42\times25\times 25}{\binom{100}2}\right\rceil\\=\left\lceil\frac{100\times75\times 50}{50\times99}\right\rceil\\=76$$ of those pairs $\mathcal P$. But unable to proceed anymore. And this approach too seems misleading, because in every pair of columns, we can always find $\binom42\times25\times25$ pairs from $\mathcal P$.

Let $n_i$ denote the number of marbles of color $i$. Let $\msP=(1^{n_1} 2^{n_2} \dots c^{n_c})$ be the multiset $\small\{\underbrace{1, \dots, 1}_{n_1},\underbrace{2,\dots,2}_{n_2},\dots,\underbrace{c,\dots,c}_{n_c}\}$ in frequency representation . The number of distinct permutations of $\msP$ is given by the multinomial: $$\left|\mfS_{\msP}\right|=\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_c}=\frac{n!}{n_1!\,n_2!\cdots n_c!}=n! \prod_{i=1}^c \frac1{n_i!}.$$ Question How many permutations of $\msP$ have a run of length k ? Let $r_k(\msS)$ be true if a permutation $\msS$ has a run of length $k$ ($k$ marbles in a row are the same color). For example, if I have 5 marbles (2 green, 2 blue, and 1 yellow), then: If $\msS$ is GBYGB , then $r_1(\msS)$ is true, but $r_2(\msS)$ is false. If $\msS$ is GBBYG or GGBBY , then $r_1(\msS)$ and $r_2(\msS)$ are true, but $r_3(\msS)$ is false. Let the number of permutations of $\msP$ having a run of length $k$ be   $$N(k; \msP)=\sum\limits_{\msS\in\mfS_\msP}[r_k(\msS)]$$   where $[x]$ denotes the Iverson bracket. Is there a formula for $N(k; \msP)$? Essentially, I would like to find a generalization of this recurrence for the case $c=2$ ( Bloom 1996 ). What I have done so far I constructed the table below, counting the permutations for configurations of up to $n=7$ marbles by brute force.  The rightmost columns count the permutations having runs of length $2≤k≤n$. Unfortunately, brute force stops being practical around $n\gtrsim 11$ (at $10^8$ permutations; see A005651 ). Here is a closer look at the permutations comprising the five $n=4$ cases. I tried to find patterns along different axes that would lead me to formulas for those specific cases, which I could then generalize, but I haven’t gotten anywhere.

Number of words with a minimal number of repetitions","Background $\newcommand\ms[1]{\mathsf #1}\def\msP{\ms P}\def\msS{\ms S}\def\mfS{\mathfrak S}$Suppose I have $n$ marbles of $c$ colors, where $c≤n$. Let $n_i$ denote the number of marbles of color $i$. Let $\msP=(1^{n_1} 2^{n_2} \dots c^{n_c})$ be the multiset $\small\{\underbrace{1, \dots, 1}_{n_1},\underbrace{2,\dots,2}_{n_2},\dots,\underbrace{c,\dots,c}_{n_c}\}$ in frequency representation . The number of distinct permutations of $\msP$ is given by the multinomial: $$\left|\mfS_{\msP}\right|=\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\dots,n_c}=\frac{n!}{n_1!\,n_2!\cdots n_c!}=n! \prod_{i=1}^c \frac1{n_i!}.$$ Question How many permutations of $\msP$ have a run of length k ? Let $r_k(\msS)$ be true if a permutation $\msS$ has a run of length $k$ ($k$ marbles in a row are the same color). For example, if I have 5 marbles (2 green, 2 blue, and 1 yellow), then: If $\msS$ is GBYGB , then $r_1(\msS)$ is true, but $r_2(\msS)$ is false. If $\msS$ is GBBYG or GGBBY , then $r_1(\msS)$ and $r_2(\msS)$ are true, but $r_3(\msS)$ is false. Let the number of permutations of $\msP$ having a run of length $k$ be   $$N(k; \msP)=\sum\limits_{\msS\in\mfS_\msP}[r_k(\msS)]$$   where $[x]$ denotes the Iverson bracket. Is there a formula for $N(k; \msP)$? Essentially, I would like to find a generalization of this recurrence for the case $c=2$ ( Bloom 1996 ). What I have done so far I constructed the table below, counting the permutations for configurations of up to $n=7$ marbles by brute force.  The rightmost columns count the permutations having runs of length $2≤k≤n$. Unfortunately, brute force stops being practical around $n\gtrsim 11$ (at $10^8$ permutations; see A005651 ). Here is a closer look at the permutations comprising the five $n=4$ cases. I tried to find patterns along different axes that would lead me to formulas for those specific cases, which I could then generalize, but I haven’t gotten anywhere. I then tried deriving a recurrence relation, also to no avail. My hunch, however, is that there may be a Fibonacci-like recurrence relation involved.

12,Sunflower combinatorics,Sunflower combinatorics,,"$\newcommand{\ms}{\mathscr}$Please give me only a small hint, or give me an easier problem to solve that would help me do this. A sunflower is a family of sets (petals) for which ever pairwise intersection is the same. I want to prove Sunflower Lemma: Let $\ms{A}$ be a family of sets such that $|A|\le\ell$ for each $A\in\ms{A}$. If $|\ms{A}|>(p-1)^\ell\ell!$, then $\ms{A}$ contains a sunflower with $p$ petals. (Thanks to Brian M Scott for the correct statement of the lemma) I though about this a lot but I didn't get much. First I realized that a family of sets like {1,2,3,4,5}, {1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2}, {1} is never a sunflower. I also found that if there is no sunflower with empty core (I named the pairwise intersection the core) then our sets are made out of at most $lp$ symbols. It's also impossible for our sunflower to have full core (equal to the whole set) because there would only be one set in our family of sets. I tried to think a bit about the probability of two sets having an intersection, but it didn't seem fruitful because it's so complex to try to generalize this to more sets. I was thinking for a while about the largest possible set containing no sunflower. If it didn't have any empty set in it's pairwise intersection then out of every $p$ sets at least one pair must have a nonempty intersection. I tried to use pigeonhole principle to get 3 petals but this gave a too weak bound. I am thinking about some way of doing the induction step for $\ell$ like for sets of size $\ell$ then $|\ms{A}|>N=(p-1)^\ell\ell!$ has n $p$-sunflower $\implies |\ms{A}|>N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ for sets of size $\ell+1$ has a $p$-sunflower. The is that if you allow the sets to be bigger, they're much more capable of avoiding being sunflowers. The reason for that might be related to my first observation. If I have $N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ then I was first thinking each of the $(p-1)(\ell+1)$ blocks of size $N$ have a sunflower in them but I don't actually have that so I need a new idea. From Andres Caicedo hints I have the following: The proof should work by induction on $\ell$, so suppose than any family of sets of size $\ell$ will contain a $p$-petalled sunflower if $|\ms{A}| > N$, we would like to find a bound on the cardinality of a family of sets of size $\ell+1$ needed for it to contain a $p$-petalled sunflower. Suppose there are not $p$ pairwise disjoint sets, since if there were we would be done. Let $\ms{F}$ be a maximal disjoint subfamily of $\ms{A}$, then every set from $\ms{A}$ has nonempty intersection with exactly one set of $\ms{F}$ (otherwise it should have been included in $\ms{F}$ since it's disjoint to everything in there). This allows us to partition $\ms{A}$ into families $\ms{A}_F$ for each $F \in \ms{F}$ and any sunflower must be completely contained in one of the families. Since there are at most $p-1$ of the $\ms{A}_F$, we we would be able to get a bound for $\ms{A}$ and be done by pigeonholing if we could just figure out how large an $\ms{A}_F$ needs to be for there to be a $p$-petalled sunflower in it. This plan seems promising but I don't quite see how we could go from the idea of induction on $\ell$ to the idea of taking a maximal disjoint subfamily. If any element was in more than $N$ of sets then we would have a sunflower by the induction hypothesis (just remove the element and we have a family of $N$ $\ell$ sets). So I asked: How many sets would we need to meet $F$ in order for an element to be contained in $N$ of them? The answer is $N|F|$ which is at most $N (\ell+1)$. The pigeonholing argument gives us that we need $N \cdot (p-1)(\ell+1)$ sets in $\ms A$.","$\newcommand{\ms}{\mathscr}$Please give me only a small hint, or give me an easier problem to solve that would help me do this.

The balls are colored, 25 are red, 25 blue, 25 green  and  25 are black. We pick four balls without replacement and repeat this step until the urn is empty. We so obtain 25 groups of four balls each and the question is: how many configurations of this type are possible?   Thereby we may assume the order of the $4$ balls in each group is not relevant as well as the order of the $25$ groups is not relevant. A reformulation: Given an alphabet $V=\{1,2,3,4\}$ we consider $4$ -letter words $x_1x_2x_3x_4$ with $1\leq       x_1\leq x_2\leq x_3\leq x_4\leq  4$ when considered as numbers. These $4$ -letter words are building blocks of words of length $100$ . We take $25$ blocks of this kind to form a $100$ -letter word $w=b_1b_2\ldots b_{25}$ with the property that $b_j\leq b_{j+1}, 1\leq j\leq 25$ when considered as numbers. Question: How many words of this type contain exactly $25$ characters of each of the characters $j\in V, 1\leq j\leq 4$ . In general we are given an alphabet $V=\{1,2,\ldots,q\}$ with size $|V|=q$ . (a) We consider words of length $N$ and building blocks $x_1x_2\ldots x_M$ of size $M$ with $1\leq x_1\leq x_2\leq \cdots \leq x_M\leq  q$ and $M|N$ , i.e. $N$ being an integer multiple of $N$ . (b) The words are of the form $w=b_1b_2\ldots b_{N/M}$ with $b_j\leq b_{j+1}, 1\leq j \leq N/M-1$ . (c) We are looking for the number $\color{blue}{A_q(N,M)}$ , the number of words as specified in (a) and (b) which contain $N/q$ characters of each of the characters $j\in V, 1\leq j\leq q$ implying that $N$ is an integer multiple of $q$ as well. In this setting the urn problem is asking for $\color{blue}{A_4(100,4)}$ . The number of building blocks of $A_q(N,M)$ can be easily determined. It is \begin{align*} \sum_{1\leq x_1\leq x_2\leq\cdots\leq x_M\leq q}1=\binom{M+q-1}{M}\tag{1} \end{align*} A generating function of (1) can be easily derived. We have \begin{align*} \sum_{M=0}^\infty\sum_{q=0}^\infty   x^My^q\binom{M+q-1}{M}&=\frac{1-x}{1-x-y}\\ &=1+y\left(1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\cdots\right)\\ &\qquad+y^2\left(1+2x+3x^2+4x^3+5x^4+\cdots\right)\\ &\qquad+y^3\left(1+3x+6x^2+10x^3+\color{blue}{15}x^4+\cdots\right)\\ &\qquad\cdots \end{align*} Denoting with $[x^M]$ the coefficient of $x^M$ in a series we see for instance $[x^4y^3]\frac{1-x}{1-x-y}=\binom{6}{2}=15$ which  is  the number of valid building  blocks of size $4$ when given  a three letter alphabet $V=\{1,2,3\}$ . These $15$ building blocks are \begin{align*} 1111\quad1122\quad1222\quad1333\quad2233\\ 1112\quad1123\quad1223\quad2222\quad2333\\ 1113\quad1133\quad1233\quad2223\quad3333\\ \end{align*} The difficult part  (at  least for me) is to determine the number of valid words $A_q(N,M)$ which  can  be generated from  these building  blocks. I've tried to derive a    generating   function  which  describes   this  scenario,  but I  wasn't   successful up to  now. Posets: Another approach could  be  using posets based upon the approach: Start  with  an  empty  word  and  append $N/M$ times a  building  block respecting the ordering given in (b). Derive a generating function for the number of valid posets. In order to better see the situation, here is a manageable example. We are looking for $A_2(12,M)$ the number of words of length $12$ from a two-letter alphabet with different block-sizes $M$ following (a) - (c) from above. The Hasse-diagrams for $M=2,3,4,6$ are: We see graded  posets  of length $N/M$ with $A_2(12,2)=A_2(12,6)=4$ and $A_2(12,3)=A_2(12,4)=5$ indicating the symmetry \begin{align*} A_q(N,M)=A_q(N,N/M) \end{align*} Here is a  list  of small  values  of $A_2(N,M)$ : $$ \begin{array}{r|rrrrrr} M&1&2\\ A_2(2,M)&1&1\\ \hline M&1&2&4\\ A_2(4,M)&1&2&1\\ \hline M&1&2&3&6\\ A_2(6,M)&1&2&2&1\\ \hline M&1&2&4&8\\ A_2(8,M)&1&3&3&1\\ \hline M&1&2&5&10\\ A_2(10,M)&1&3&3&1\\ \hline M&1&2&3&4&6&12\\ A_2(12,M)&1&4&5&5&4&1\\ \end{array} $$ Summary: The question  is how to find a formula for $A_q(N,M)$ or how to derive a generating function for these numbers.

31,Polynomials $P(x)\in k[x]$ satisfying condition $P(x^2)=P(-x)P(x)$,Polynomials  satisfying condition,P(x)\in k[x] P(x^2)=P(-x)P(x),"Fix a field $k$ .  Let $P(x)\in k[x]$ be such that $$(1)\ \ \ \ \ P(x^2)=P(-x)P(x).$$ Let $T(k,d)\subseteq k[x]$ denote the set of solutions to $(1)$ of degree $d$ , and $t(k,d)=\big|T(k,d)\big|$ .  Constant solutions are obviously $P\equiv 0$ and $P\equiv 1$ .  So $T(k,0)=\{0,1\}$ and $t(k,0)=2$ .  We assume from now on that $d>0$ , so $P(x)$ is non-constant. Questions: (a) Is it possible to list all elements of $T(k,d)$ ?   (b) How to calculate $t(k,d)$ ?  (If this is too broad, we can take $k$ to be $\Bbb R$ or $\Bbb C$ .) Here is my attempt.  If $z\in \overline{k}$ is a root of $P(x)$ , then $z^{2^n}$ is a root of $P(x)$ for every $n$ .  Since $P$ has finitely many roots, we must have $z=0$ or $z^{2^n-1}=1$ for some positive integer $n$ .  Suppose that $0$ is a root of $P(x)$ of multiplicity $m_0$ .  Then, $P(x)=x^{m_0}P_1(x)$ for some $P_1(x)\in k[x]$ such that $P_1(0)\neq 0$ .   Using $(1)$ we get $$(2)\ \ \ \ \ P_1(x^2)=(-1)^{m_0}P_1(-x)P_1(x).$$ Let $m_1$ be the smallest positive integer such that $P_1(x)$ has a root $w_1\in\overline k$ such that $w_1^{2^{m_1}-1}=1$ .  Because $m_1$ is the smallest possible, $w_1$ , $w_1^2$ , $w_1^{2^2}$ , $\ldots$ , $w_1^{2^{m_1-1}}$ are pairwise distinct roots of $P_1(x)$ .  This shows that $$P_1(x)=\prod_{r=0}^{m_1-1}\left(x-w_1^{2^r}\right)P_2(x),$$ where $P_2(x)\in\overline{k}[x]$ satisfies $$P_2(x^2)=(-1)^{m_0+m_1}P_2(-x)P_2(x).$$ In the end, we can use induction to show that there exist integers $m_0\geq 0$ , $m_1>0$ , $m_2>0$ , $\dots$ , $m_l>0$ such that $$(3)\ \ \ \ \ P(x)=(-1)^d\,x^{m_0}\,W_1(x)\,W_2(x)\,\cdots\,W_l(x)\,,$$ where $m_0+m_1+m_2+\ldots+m_l=d$ and each $W_j(x)\in \overline{k}[x]$ is of the form $$\prod_{r=0}^{m_j-1}\,\left(x-w_j^{2^{r}}\right)\,,$$ where each $w_j\in\overline{k}$ is a root of $z^{2^{m_j}-1}-1$ , but not a root of $z^{2^r-1}=1$ for any positive integer $r<m_j$ .  If $k$ is algebraically closed then $(3)$ is as good a description as you can get, I guess.  But what happens when $k$ is not algebraically closed? In particular, if $d=4$ and $k=\Bbb C$ , there are the following possible choices: $P(x)=x^4$ $P(x)=x^3\,(x-1)$ $P(x)=x^2\,(x-1)^2$ $P(x)=x^2\,(x^2+x+1)$ $P(x)=x\,(x-1)^3$ $P(x)=x\,(x-1)\,(x^2+x+1)$ $P(x)=x\,\prod\limits_{r=0}^2\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{7}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=x\,\prod\limits_{r=0}^2\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(-\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{7}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=(x-1)^4$ $P(x)=(x-1)^2\,(x^2+x+1)$ $P(x)=(x-1)\,\prod\limits_{r=0}^2\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{7}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=(x-1)\,\prod\limits_{r=0}^2\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(-\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{7}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)^2$ $P(x)=\prod\limits_{r=0}^3\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{15}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=\prod\limits_{r=0}^3\,\Bigg(x-\exp\left(-\frac{2\pi {2^r} i}{15}\right)\Bigg)$ $P(x)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ .

I have been working on an algorithm that gets the desired results, but I am having difficulties getting the algorithm to perform well. The problem domain is the medical equipment supply industry, and the basic requirement is to assign items to packages so that the rental charge is minimized. Equipment can be rented individually, but there are also packages defined containing a combination of equipments, and the rental charge of the packages is less than the total rental charge of the individual equipments. While generating the bill, I need to assign the items to packages wherever possible in such a way that the total rental charge is minimized.

Assumptions / Requirements: Each package has a rental charge associated with it, as does each Item Type. When renting a package, only the package price is charged, not the items inside the package. A rental can consist of both packages and individual items. When renting out X number of items of different types, the items should be assigned to packages where possible, so that the total rental is minimized. There can be multiple ways of forming the packages, and the ones with the lowest rental should be selected. There can be multiple combinations that produce the lowest rental.

The number of available packages can vary from 10 to 20. An additional complexity that I will need to add later is to support the concept of packages contained inside packages. I need to run this for multiple rental bills in a batch mode, which makes the performance of the algorithm so critical. My approach so far: For each item, find a list of the packages that it can belong to based on the item type. Create a graph where each node is a item-package assignment. Arrange the graph so that the nodes at each leaf level represent the possible package assignments for a single item.

You are able to arrange those numbers in any way, and after each step you are told how many of the items on your list are in the correct position, but not which ones. The goal is to guess the order of the secret list in as few steps as possible.

Given a maximum number of guesses , is there a strategy that maximizes your probability of finding the right order in steps? So far I haven't been able to make much headway. I though I could do something by keeping a fixed order and rotating it times, which would put every item in all but one spot once without double counting, and the st could be deduced given the number of correct spaces would have to add up to .

45,An application of the Inclusion Principle to Chemistry? (Proof Verification),An application of the Inclusion Principle to Chemistry?

Guessing if there are going to be double or triple bonds is kind of annoying. I’d like to be able to come up with a formula to predict the total number of bonds a molecule will form. I count a double bond as $2$ bonds, and a triple bond as $3$. What I’d like to prove Count a single bond as $1$ bond, a double as $2$ bonds, and a triple as $3$.

How many $p$ -splittings of $[k]$ are there for each of these available $k$ 's?  If the exact number of $p$ -splittings of $[k]$ is not easily computable, then what is the asymptotic answer? Clearly, $k=-1$ and $k=0$ are $p$ -splittable.  We can also ignore the trivial case $p=1$ .  We know that, if $p=2$ , then all $p$ -splittable numbers are of the forms $4t-1$ and $4t$ , where $t$ is a nonnegative integer.  If $p$ is an odd prime, then all $p$ -splittable numbers are integers of the forms $tp-1$ and $tp$ , where $t\in\{0,2,3,4,\ldots\}$ . For $p=2$ , we can show that the number of $2$ -splittings of a $2$ -splittable integer $k$ is given by the coefficient of $x^{\frac{k(k+1)}{4}}$ in the expansion of $\prod_{r=1}^k\,\left(1+x^r\right)$ .  For example, if $k=3$ , there are two $2$ -splittings of $[3]$ , namely, $\big\{\{0,1,2\},\{3\}\big\}$ and $\big\{\{1,2\},\{0,3\}\big\}$ , whereas $$\prod_{r=1}^3\,\left(1+x^r\right)=1+x+x^2+2x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6$$ whose coefficient of $x^{\frac{k(k+1)}{4}}=x^3$ is also $2$ .

I do not know if there is any closed form for this coefficient for an arbitrary $2$ -splittable $k$ . I conjecture the following: (1) If $p$ is odd, then, for any $j\in\{-1,0,1,2,\ldots,p-2\}$ such that $p\mid j(j+1)$ , every integer of the form $tp+j$ , where $t\in\{2,3,4,\ldots\}$ , is $p$ -splittable, and nothing else (except $-1$ and $0$ ) is $p$ -splittable. (2) If $p$ is even, then, for any $j\in\{-1,0,1,2,\ldots,2p-2\}$ such that $2p\mid j(j+1)$ , every integer of the form $2tp+j$ , where $t$ is a positive integer, is $p$ -splittable, and nothing else (except $-1$ and $0$ ) is $p$ -splittable.

Given such an $\underline{\alpha}$ , we define the following: $$ OBJ(\underline{\alpha}):=\sum_{A\neq \emptyset} \alpha_A \log(|A|), \quad v(\underline{\alpha})=\sum_{A\neq \emptyset} \alpha_A, \quad E(\underline{\alpha})=\sum_{\{ \{A,B\}: A,B \subseteq [q], A\cap B=\emptyset \}} \alpha_A \alpha_B, $$ where the sum in the definition of $E(\underline{\alpha})$ is taken over all unordered pairs of disjoint subsets of $[q]$ .

57,Finding a combinatorial formula for the following sequence of tables,Finding a combinatorial formula for the following sequence of tables,,"While studying a subject in mathematical physics and topology (which is not necessarily relevant to this question anyway), I bumped into the following sequence of tables, let's call them $M_0, M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, \cdots$. (The table goes on, but it gets a little too big after $M_4$, so I could only write down one quarter of $M_5$.) These tables have some interesting patterns and symmetry, but a simple formula completely characterizing them is still missing. So the question is : what would be a simple (combinatorial) formula for $M_n$? Let me briefly explain the meaning of the entries. Each entry of these matrices is a multiset of integers. I used exponent for multiplicity; e.g. $6,4^2,2^2,0,-6,-8,-10$ actually means $6,4,4,2,2,0,-6,-8,-10$.  Also in the last two tables overlined numbers $\overline{n}$ just mean $-n$. (I had to introduce this notation to save up space.) Finally, let me list some of obvious patterns you can see : $M_n$ is $(n+1)$-by-$ (n+1)$, and its entries are all even/odd depending on the parity of $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. $M_n$ is symmetric under flipping along the diagonal. If you flip $M_n$ either vertically or horizontally, you get $-M_n$. Let's index rows and columns of $M_n$ by numbers $0, 1, \cdots, n$. Then the $(i,j)$-entry of $M_n$ is a multiset of size $\binom{n}{i}\binom{n}{j}$.

A graph $G$ is in $\mathcal G$ if it has the following property: For any vertex $v$ , any coloring $c$ of $G$ and any color $\alpha\in c[N(v)]$ there is a coloring $k$ of $G$ such that There is no vertex $u\neq v$ such that $k(u) = k(v)$ $k^{-1}[\alpha]\cap N(v) = c^{-1}[\alpha]\cap N(v)$ That is, given a coloring, we can always find another one that preserves a chosen color in the neighborhood of a chosen vertex while making the color of this vertex unique in the graph.

63,Induction step is not clear in Bóna's proof that the generating function of the alternating runs has $-1$ as a root of a certain multiplicity,Induction step is not clear in Bóna's proof that the generating function of the alternating runs has  as a root of a certain multiplicity,-1,"I am reading the book Combinatorics of Permutations (2nd edition) by Miklós Bóna, and in $\S$ 1.2 Alternating Runs , he states and proves a lemma on page 29 whose proof I do not fully understand. Assume $n > 1$ . Let $p := p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_n$ be a permutation in $S_n$ . We say that $p$ changes direction at $i \in \left\{2,3,\ldots,n-1\right\}$ if either $p_{i-1} < p_i > p_{i+1}$ or $p_{i-1} > p_i < p_{i+1}$ . We say that $p$ has $k$ alternating runs if $p$ changes direction at $k-1$ points. Let $r(p)$ denote the number of alternating runs of $p$ . Let $G(n,k) := \lvert\{ p \in S_n : r(p) = k\}\rvert$ , that is, $G(n,k)$ equals the number of permutations in $S_n$ having $k$ alternating runs. Consider the generating function $$ G_n(x) := \sum_{p \in S_n} x^{r(p)} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} G(n,k) x^k $$ Observe that the coefficients of $G_n(x)$ are all even, because if $p \in S_n$ has $k$ alternating runs, then so does $p^c$ , the complement of $p$ , given by $p^c(i) := n + 1 - p(i)$ . One also empirically observes that $-1$ is a root of $G_n(x)$ with multiplicity $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$ , by computing $G_n(x)$ for many small values of $n$ . Bóna gives a combinatorial proof that the second observation holds for all $n > 1$ , and this is essentially the content of the lemma on page 29. Some more definitions before stating it: Let $1 \leq j \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ and $p \in S_n$ . We say that $p$ is $j$ -half-ascending if the last $j$ disjoint pairs of elements in the sequence $p_1,p_2,\dotsc,p_n$ are ascending, that is, if $p_{n+1-2i} < p_{n+2-2i}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq j$ . For a $(j+1)$ -half-ascending permutation $p \in S_n$ , define $r_j(p)$ to be the number of alternating runs of the subsequence $p_1,p_2,\dotsc,p_{n-2j}$ , and $s_j(p)$ to be the number of descents of the subsequence $p_{n-2j},p_{n-2j+1},\dotsc,p_n$ (the number of descents of a sequence $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k$ is the cardinality of the set $\{i \in [k-1] : u_i > u_{i+1}\}$ ). Define $t_j(p) := r_j(p) + s_j(p)$ , and define $$ G_{n,j}(x) := \sum_{p} x^{t_j(p)}, $$ where the sum is taken over all the $(j+1)$ -half-ascending permutations $p$ in $S_n$ . Now, we have the following lemma on page 29: LEMMA 1.41 For all $n > 1$ and $0 \leq j \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor -1$ , we have $$ \frac{G_n(x)}{2(1+x)^j} = G_{n,j}(x). $$ The proof is purportedly by induction. The base cases are easy: this is how they go. Base case I: $j=0$ and $n \geq 2$ . A $1$ -half-ascending permutation $p \in S_n$ satisfies the single constraint $p_{n-1} < p_n$ . Clearly, $r_0(p) = r(p)$ and $s_0(p) = 0$ , so $t_0(p) = r(p)$ . Since $r(p) = r(p^c)$ , and for every $p \in S_n$ either $p$ or $p^c$ is $1$ -half-ascending, we see that $$ \frac{G_n(x)}{2} = G_{n,0}(x), $$ as required. Base Case II: $j = 1$ and $n \geq 4$ . A similar argument as in the previous case shows that $$ \frac{G_n(x)}{2} = \sum_{p : p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}} x^{r(p)}. $$ Let $I \colon S_n \to S_n$ be the involution defined by $I(p_1\dotsm p_{n-2}p_{n-1}p_n) := p_1\dotsm p_{n-2}p_n p_{n-1}$ , that is, $I$ swaps $p_{n-1}$ and $p_n$ . One can check that for every $p \in S_n$ such that $p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}$ , $r(p)$ and $r(I(p))$ differ by $1$ . Let $q \equiv q(p)$ be that permutation in the set $\{ p, I(p) \}$ with smaller number of alternating runs. Then, $$ \sum_{p : p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}} x^{r(p)} = \sum_{q(p)} \bigl(x^{r(q)} + x^{r(q)+1}\bigr) = (1+x) \sum_{q(p)} x^{r(q)}. $$ Let $q' \equiv q'(p)$ be that permutation in the set $\{ p, I(p) \}$ which is $2$ -half-ascending. Then, it turns out that $r(q) = t_1(q')$ , so that $$ \sum_{q(p)} x^{r(q)} = \sum_{q'(p)} x^{t_1(q')} = G_{n,1}(x). $$ Hence, $$ \frac{G_n(x)}{2(1+x)} = G_{n,1}(x), $$ as required. Now, how does one check that $r(q) = t_1(q')$ ? Note that it suffices to check this in the case $n = 4$ , because it is only the last $4$ terms in the sequence $p_1,\dotsc,p_n$ that are really relevant here. Thus, one just writes down all $6$ pairs of elements of the form $(p,I(p))$ where $p \in S_4$ is $2$ -half-ascending, and checks that $t_1(p)$ equals the number of alternating runs of that permutation between $p$ and $I(p)$ which has smaller number of alternating runs. This completes the second base case. Induction Step. Now, this is what Bóna has to say regarding the induction step (on pages 29–30): Now let us assume that we know that the statement holds for $j-1$ and prove it for $j$ . Apply $I$ to the two rightmost entries of our permutations to get pairs as in the initial case, and apply the induction hypothesis to the leftmost $n-2$ elements. By the induction hypothesis, the string of the leftmost $n-2$ elements can be replaced by a $j$ -half-ascending $(n-2)$ -permutation, and the number of runs can be replaced by the $t_{j-1}$ -parameter. In particular, $p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}$ will hold, and therefore we can verify that our statement holds in both cases ( $p_{n-2} < p_{n-1}$ or $p_{n-2} > p_{n-1}$ ) exactly as we did in the proof of the initial case. $\blacksquare$ Quite frankly, this is completely confusing and I can find no interpretation of this paragraph that actually works. For example, what does . . .apply the induction hypothesis to the leftmost $n-2$ elements. . . mean? How does one apply the induction hypothesis to individual elements? This is just one of many points due to which the given outline for the inductive step does not go through, in my opinion. Can anyone help me find out how to fix the proof, or even exhibit how the inductive step works in the case $n = 6$ ?

87,Can you win the monochromatic urn game?,Can you win the monochromatic urn game?,,"In the (monochromatic) urn depletion game , you are given $n$ vases, each containing some number of balls $a_1,\ldots, a_n \geq 0$ . You win the game if you can remove all of the balls from the vases; you must draw them one at a time, and the only rule is that you cannot draw from the same vase twice in a row. The problem is to decide, given the occupancy numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ , whether the game is winnable. Example: The game [AAA, A] (three in one vase; one in another) is unwinnable. I've already got an efficient algorithm for winning the game: at each step, draw from the vase with the largest number of balls $a_i$ (among vases you can legally choose). If the game is winnable at all, this algorithm will win it. So instead of an algorithm, I am looking for a property of the numbers $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ which would enable someone to calculate whether the game is winnable. Evidently there's a formula implicit in the algorithm above, but I wonder if it's possible to find an explicit and simple one. I've tried establishing the result for small $n$ : if $n=1$ , $a_1$ must be 0 or 1. If $n=2$ , then $|a_1-a_2|$ must be 0 or 1. If $n=3$ , the condition is slightly more complicated but might be expressible in terms of the differences $|a_i-a_j|$ . It also seems to me that a game instance is solvable just if you can find a perfect or near-perfect matching in a particular graph—the graph has one node for every ball in every vase, and each ball is connected to all the balls in the other vases. Rationale: Given such a matching, you can win the game as follows: iterate over the edges in an arbitrary order; for each edge, at least one of the two endpoints will belong to a legal urn; draw that one, then the other.  Conversely, a winnable game has at least one winning sequence of draws. Form a [near]-perfect matching by pairing consecutively drawn balls, starting with the first and second, third and fourth, etc. The graph matching approach seems like a potentially fruitful avenue, but I don't know much about matching or matching polynomials to do much more.

(1 answer) Closed 7 years ago . Let $A$ be a $3\times 3$ matrix with integer entries such that $\det(A)=1$. At most how many entries of $A$ can be even? I get a possible solution as $6$ by considering the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix. But I am not sure about that is it possible to have more than $6$ even entries. Please help me enumerate this problem to prove my answer.,,"['combinatorics', 'matrices', 'determinant']"
