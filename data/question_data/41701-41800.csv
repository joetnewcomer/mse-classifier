2,What other kinds of cubic integer rings are there?,What other kinds of cubic integer rings are there?,,"Given an integer $n \in \Bbb{Z}$ , we understand $\root 3 \of n$ to mean the number $x \in \Bbb{R}$ such that $x^3 - n = 0$ .

(a) Prove that $I \subseteq R$ is prime if and only if $R/I$ is an integral domain. Proof. First note that the zero element of the ring $R/I$ is $0 + I = I$ and that $a + I = I$ if and only if $a \in I$. Now suppose that $I \subseteq R$ is a prime ideal and consider nonzero cosets $a + I$ and $b + I$ in $R/I$ (i.e. consider $a \not \in I$ and $b \not \in I$). Since $I$ is prime this implies that $ab \not \in I$, hence $ab + I \neq I$ and we conclude that $R/I$ is an integral domain. Conversely, let $R/I$ be an integral domain and consider $a, b \in R$ with $ab \in I$ (i.e. consider $ab + I = I$). Since $(a + I)(b + I) = ab + I = I$ and $R/I$ is an integral domain we conclude that either $a + I = I$ (i.e., $a \in I$) or $b + I = I$ (i.e., $b \in I$). Hence $I \subseteq R$ is a prime ideal.

6,Are there an infinite number of binary operations for any set?,Are there an infinite number of binary operations for any set?,,"I have just begun to take a look at A First Course in Abstract Algebra by Fraleigh. The following definition is provided (ed. 6, pp. 32). Definition: A binary operation, $*$ on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$. For each $(a,b) \in S \times S$, we will denote the element $*((a,b))$ of $S$ by $a*b$. After experimenting with the definition, I began to wonder whether regardless of what $S$ is, will there always be a possible binary operation. I thought, yes. Conjecture: Let $S$ be a set. Regardless of what $S$ contains, there always exists at least one binary operation on $S$. Proof: Let $S = \emptyset $. Then the statement there exists a function mapping $S \times S$ into $S$ is vacuously true since there are no elements to map. Thus the proposition is true for the empty set case. Suppose $S$ is not empty. Let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary elements of $S$, and in the case where $S$ has just one element $a= b$. Definite $*$ to always return the first item in the ordered pair, such that $a*b=a$. This would map $S \times S$ into $S$ regardless of what the set $S$ may be. Therefore, every possible set has a possible binary operations. This seems to demonstrate there is always a binary operation for a set, but then it lead me to wonder whether there is also an infinite number of binary operations for any given set $S$. Conjecture: Let $S$ be a set. Regardless of what $S$ contains, there is an infinite number of possible binary operations on $S$. After thinking of possible binary relations, I think I have come up with a proof that shows the above statement is true. Proof: If $S$ is empty, then any declared binary operation would be vacuously true. If $S$ is not empty, and $S$ is an infinite set. Define a binary operation on $S$ as: let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary elements of $S$. Then $a *_n b$ always returns the $n^{th}$ element in the set $S$. Any infinite number of $n$ can be chosen, thus there are an infinite number of binary relations on $S$ when $S$ is infinite. If $S$ is not empty and finite, define a new set $S'$. $S'$ contains the same elements as $S$ in the same order, and where $S$ terminates, $S'$ continues with the last element of $S$ repeated over again. Thus defining the binary operation as in the infinite case, but on $S'$, we get the same result since every element in $S'$ is in $S$. Example: Let $S = \{ a , b , c \}$. Then $S' = \{ a , b , c , c , c , ... \}$ What I am wondering is: Are my proofs of my conjectures correct?

82,Any subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ must contain every rational number,Any subfield of  must contain every rational number,\mathbb{C},"I tried to prove that any subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ must contain every rational number by contradiction. Proof: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be any subfield of $\mathbb{C}$. Thus, $\mathbb{F}$ is itself  a  field  under  the  usual  operations  of  addition  and  multiplication  of  complex  numbers. For $\mathbb{F}$ to be a field, $0$ and $1$ must belong to $\mathbb{F}$. We have to prove that any subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ must contain every rational number. Let us assume on the contrary that there exists at least one rational number $q \neq 0$ such that $q \notin \mathbb{F}$. Let $-q$ and $\frac{1}{q}$ are in $\mathbb{F}$. Then since $\mathbb{F}$ is a field, it must contain additive inverse of $-q$ and multiplicative inverse of $\frac{1}{q}$; i.e. $q$ must be in $\mathbb{F}$. But, according to our assumption, $q \notin \mathbb{F}$; which implies that $\mathbb{F}$ is not a field. Thus we arrive at a contradiction. Now, let $-q$ and $1/q$ are also not in $\mathbb{F}$ ( edit - here I mean to say all elements of $\mathbb{Q}$, except $q$, $-q$ and $\frac{1}{q}$, are in $\mathbb{F}$). Then $\mathbb{F}$ does not satisfy closure under addition and multiplication, which again leads to the contradiction that $\mathbb{F}$ is not a field. Hence any subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ must contain every rational number. Q.E.D. I just need feedback on whether it is correct and how I can improve it (especially the last portion). Also, can we modify the statement of the result into - The set of rational numbers is the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ ? Thanks. Edit: Thank you all of you for your valuable feedback. I think I did not write my arguments in the second part of the proof quite clearly. Here is how my chain of thoughts were - Since I assumed that at least one element $q$ of rational number is not in $\mathbb{F}$, so there may be more than one element of $\mathbb{Q}$ that are not in $\mathbb{F}$. This is why I assumed in the second part the non presence of $−q$ and $q^{−1}$. Now, consider for example all rational numbers, except $2$, $−2$ and $0.5$, are in $\mathbb{F}$ (as $q$, $-q$ and $q^{-1}$ in second part). Then $1−3=−2$ , such that $1,3 \in \mathbb{F}$ implies that closure does not hold. May be I should have added something like - Since $1, -(q+1)\in\mathbb{F}$, then by closure $1+{-(q+1)} = -q \in \mathbb{F}$. But $-q \notin \mathbb{F}$ which implies closures does not hold. I hope my arguments are convincing enough. I look forward to more comments.  Thanks.. Edit 2 - I realized where I made mistake in the above proof.

83,Can a principal ideal contain a non-principal ideal?,Can a principal ideal contain a non-principal ideal?,,"I am trying to show that if $R$ is an integral domain such that every prime ideal of $R$ is principal then every ideal of $R$ is principal. To start this, suppose that $P$ is the set of ideals of $R$ that are not principal. Suppose that $P$ is nonempty. I am trying to apply Zorn's Lemma to show that $P$ has a maximal element and to do this, I want to show that every chain in $P$ is bounded above by $R$ itself. This leads to my question of whether a principal ideal can contain a non-principal ideal. Claim: Suppose that $R$ is a principal. Then any ideal $I$ of $R$ is a principal ideal. Proof: $R$ is principal so for some element $\alpha\in R$, $R=(\alpha)$. Suppose that $I$ is any ideal of $R$. Furthermore, suppose that $I$ is generated by two elements, say $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ so $I=(a_{1},a_{2})$. Since $I\subseteq R$, $a_{1},a_{2}\in R$ so since $R=(\alpha)$ there exist elements $\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\in R$ such that $\alpha\beta_{1}=a_{1},\alpha\beta_{2}=a_{2}$. Then since any element of $I$ is of the form $a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}$ where $b_{1},b_{2}\in R$, it follows that the elements of $I$ are of the form $\alpha(\beta_{1}b_{1}+\beta_{2}b_{2})$ where $\beta_{1}b_{1}+\beta_{2}b_{2}$. Since any element of $I$ is of this form, $I=(a_{1},a_{2})=(\alpha)$ so $I$ is a principal ideal. I then move onto the next part of the exercise which says to show that if $I$ is a non-principal ideal in $R$, then $I_{a}=(I,a)$ for some $a\in R$ is a principal ideal. $I\subseteq I_{a}$ so principal ideals can contain non-principal ideals.

Ignoring the argument about the semantics of the language used ( I am of the firm opinion that ""itself"" is in reference to the parent group, not the subgroup ) this got me wondering about examples of groups which have this property.  That is to say, a group $G$ that has a proper subgroup $H$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to $H$ . A few examples came to mind such as $(\Bbb Z,+) > (2\Bbb Z,+)$ and $(\Bbb Q^*,\times) > (K,\times)$ where $K=\{\frac{a}{b}~:~a,b\in\Bbb Z\setminus\{0\},~\gcd(a,2)=\gcd(b,2)=1\}$ and similar.  ( Note: subgroup, not subring ) I got to thinking about $(\Bbb R,+)$ however and wondering whether or not the real numbers have a subgroup isomorphic to the reals with respect to addition.  My gut feeling is no, but I am at a loss as to how to prove this or come up with an example.  Proper subgroups certainly exist, such as how $(\Bbb Q,+)<(\overline{\Bbb Q},+)<(\Bbb R,+)$ , and so by specifying that our proper subgroup $H$ doesn't contain some element $x$ , be it rational or irrational, that doesn't preclude $H$ from existing. So then, I ask you, does $(\Bbb R,+)$ have a proper subgroup isomorphic to $(\Bbb R,+)$ ?  How does one prove it doesn't ( if it doesn't )?  Does it even have a proper subgroup which is uncountable?

97,Is any closed set with two elements a group?,Is any closed set with two elements a group?,,"Suppose you have a set $S = \{a,b\}$  that is closed under an associative operation $ * $, is S necessarily a group? I am having great difficulty trying to prove to myself that there exists a unique identity element. As S is closed by $*$, $ a*a=a$ or exclusively $a*a=b$. So far, my approach is to show that $a*a=a$ is equivalent to $b*b=a$, however I cannot seem to manipulate the equations to force that implication. Would anyone be able to shed some light? Many Thanks.","Suppose you have a set $S = \{a,b\}$  that is closed under an associative operation $ * $, is S necessarily a group?

98,Product and Intersection of n ideals,Product and Intersection of n ideals,,"I am trying to prove that the product of $n$ pairwise coprime ideals is their intersection. I can easily do the proof for $n=2$, and I see how to generalize the argument but there are details I don't know how to handle. Here's my attempt: Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $I_1,\dots,I_n$ be a collection of ideals such that $I_i+I_j=R$ for all $i\neq j$. Then $\cap_i I_i\subseteq\prod_i I_i$. For all $i\neq j$ I can find elements $a_{ij}\in I_i$, $a_{ji}\in I_j$ such that $a_{ij}+a_{ji}=1$. Thus if $x\in \cap_i I_i$, it can be written as \begin{equation} x=\prod_{i\neq j} (a_{ij}+a_{ji}) x. \end{equation} My problem is: how to write the above product as a sum of products of elements of each ideal. I can see it works, but the product gets super-messy already with $n=3$, so I don't see how to write it in  close form.","I am trying to prove that the product of $n$ pairwise coprime ideals is their intersection.
