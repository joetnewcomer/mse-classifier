I am curious if formal mathematics has approached this same concept in a formal way. My idea is as follows If we evaluate $f(x)=x^2$ from $x=1$ to $x=2$ , then the domain is $[1<x<2]$ and the range is $[1<x<4]$ . If it is continuous, then we can choose any point $y'$ in the range $1$ to $4$ , and find a value $x'$ that satisfies the relation $y'=(x')^2$ and where $x$ has a value between $1$ and $2$ . The same applies the other way: if we choose any value $x''$ between $1$ and $2$ , we can find a value $y''$ that is located between $1$ and $4$ , and that satisfies the relation $y''=(x'')^2$ . Since both, $x''$ and $y'$ were arbitrary, that means that the set of values from $1$ to $2$ (the domain) has the same size as the set of values from $1$ to $4$ (the range), but that is not possible. I know there are infinite values between two given numbers, and that comparing infinities is often a problem. However, I am interested in how can $x^2$ be continuous if basic logic says that the infinite range is bigger than the domain. I am starting with mathematical analysis, so my logic is probably wrong, but if so, I would like to know what I am missing. Also, English is not my first language. I apologize in advance if I am not using the proper terms. EDIT: I was focused on my idea and I gave a wrong definition of continuity.

I don't see the relevance of adding the $3$ and $3^2$.","I am to calculate $\frac{e^{6x}-2e^{3x} + 1}{x^2}$ when $x$ goes towards $0$. I find that $$\frac{e^{6x}-2e^{3x} + 1}{x^2} = \frac{(e^{3x}-1)^2}{x^2} =  \left(\frac{e^{3x}-1}{x}\right)^2$$ $$\left(\frac{e^{3x}-1}{x}\right)^2 \rightarrow 1^2$$ but according to the answer in the book I am incorrect. It agrees with me halfway through, but ends with $$\frac{(e^{3x}-1)^2}{x^2} =  9\left(\frac{e^{3x}-1}{3x}\right)^2 \rightarrow 9 \times 1^2$$ While this is correct mathematically, why would it be $3$ and $9$ instead of for example $4$ and $16$ or, as in my case, $1$ and $1$? I don't see the relevance of adding the $3$ and $3^2$.",,"['calculus', 'limits', 'exponential-function']"
