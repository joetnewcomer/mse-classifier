One of those is reflexivity. My attempt to answer the question: I read the Reflexivity article on Wikipedia, but I'm still foggy on the idea. I get that 1=1 is reflexive, and 1<2 is not. I understand that 1=1 is relating one to one, but it seems so redundant that I can't imagine it being often used in math - but I believe that it is - so I must be missing something. Also, I read that the 'divides' relationship (2 divides 4) is reflexive. I don't see how that is reflexive. Question How can something be related to itself? Why is reflexivity a useful concept? How is the divides relationship reflexive? An abstract explanation and concrete example would be helpful. Thank you. -Hal",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'terminology', 'intuition', 'relations']"

Proof: It follows from the fact that 0,9999... = 1, that any integer $n$ can be represented as $(n-1),9999...$ This similarly works for rational numbers with finite digits, as follows: let $n_i$ be the $i$-th digit after the comma of a rational number with a finite number of digits $k$.

Then $|X|<|\mathcal{P}(X)|$ Proof: Define map $\varphi:X\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)$ by $\varphi:x\mapsto\{x\}$. $\varphi$ is injective, thus $|X|\leq|\mathcal{P}(X)|$. Now suppose there is a bijection (surjection) $\psi:X\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(X)$. Denote the set $A=\{x\in X, x\notin \psi(x)\}$.

Thus $A=\{1,2\}$ and the case is $\forall a\in X:a\in{A}$ thus the second case of the proof applies. Basically this leads me to the following idea: instead of constructing this set $A$, we can say that: Estabilish injection and thus $|X|\leq|\mathcal{P}(X)|$ by $\varphi:x\mapsto\{x\}$ thus $\forall{S}\in\varphi(x):|S|=1$, but for any set $X:$ $\emptyset\subset\mathcal{P}(X)$ but $|\emptyset|=0$ so $\emptyset\notin ran(\varphi)$ thus $\varphi$ is not surjective.","I'll state the Cantor's theorem proof as is it is in my study texts: Theorem (Cantor): Let $X$ be any set.

Exponentiation can also be thought of as repeated multiplication of natural numbers such that $a^2 = a\times a$ $a^3 = a\times a\times a$ $\cdots$ $a^n = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_\text{n times}$ where $a, n \in N$. More formally, we have the following requirements of exponentiation (as repeated multiplication on $N$): $\forall x\in N: x^2 = x\cdot x$ $\forall x,y\in N: x^{y+1}=x^y\cdot x$ It can be formally proven (see link) that there are infinitely many binary functions on $N$ that satisfy these two requirements.

For these reasons, I think $0^0$ should probably left undefined, as has been an accepted practice for nearly two centuries (since Cauchy, 1820). From (1) and (2), we can also derive the usual Laws of Exponents provided we avoid any explicit reference to a value for $0^0$.

My question: While there may be similarities, how is the leap made from repeated Cartesian products to repeated multiplication on the natural numbers (in order to justify $0^0=1$)? Or are they two fundamentally different things? Added: Are (1) and (2) above insufficient as requirements for repeated multiplication on $N$?

From (1) and (2), we can also derive the usual Laws of Exponents provided we avoid any explicit reference to a value for $0^0$. From (1) and (2), we can, for example, derive: $\forall x,y,z\in N: [x\neq 0 \implies x^y\cdot x^z = x^{y+z}]$ (For a formal development of these ideas, see ""Oh, the Ambiguity!"" at my math blog .) My question: While there may be similarities, how is the leap made from repeated Cartesian products to repeated multiplication on the natural numbers (in order to justify $0^0=1$)? Or are they two fundamentally different things? Added: Are (1) and (2) above insufficient as requirements for repeated multiplication on $N$? If so, what other requirements might reasonably be added to enable us to derive $0^0=1$ (or any other particular value)? Note: This question is a follow-up to my answer at Why is $ A^0 = \{ \emptyset \}$?",,"['real-analysis', 'elementary-number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
