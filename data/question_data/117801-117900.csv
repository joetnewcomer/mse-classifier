2,How many times harder is to think in 3D as compared with 2D?,How many times harder is to think in 3D as compared with 2D?,,"I'm a chemist, currently going through a course about molecular symmetry and group theory applied to Chemistry. This subject is very demanding in terms of visualization in 3D space. To really grasp the subject, one must be able to see, for example, how the orbitals around a given nucleus transform when subjected to the different symmetry operations in space. I'm stumped by the sheer difficulty I have at it, specially given I deem myself good at reasoning with geometric concepts in the 2D plane. Add just one dimension and now it feels like to be in a quagmire. That makes me wonder, can you put hard numbers in this increased overhead when going from 2D to 3D? How much more processing power is necessary to reason about 3D space? A linear scaling can be surely ruled out as, at least for me, 3D doesn't feel like just 50% more difficult. It feels like a several fold increase in complexity. Could be the case it scales like area or volume, as a power of the number of dimensions, say, n³? What about a generalization to higher dimensions? How much more difficult a 4D being would have reasoning about 4D as compared with 3D? I would not be surprised if grasping something like a 4D were very difficult or even impossible for us, as we don't experience 4D spatial dimensions.

7,Area of Shaded Region Inside Quadrilateral,Area of Shaded Region Inside Quadrilateral,,"I recently saw a similar problem online but found the area in a completely different way. Problem: There is a unit square, i.e. a square with side length equal to $\text 1$ . Two lines are placed inside the square. Lets call them $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ and $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ . $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ is straight - It starts at a vertex and intersects the square exactly half way on the opposite edge. $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ is curved - It is a quarter circle with radius, $r$ , the same length as the square, i.e. $r=1$ . The diagram below shows the representation of the description provided above (I am not a geometric mathematician so forgive my elementary descriptions - please): The goal is to find the area $A$ . My Attempt: My intuition was to straight away subtract areas. So find the area of the quarter circle and subtract off the area under the intersection of $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ and $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ . So in the following diagram I find area $A+B+C$ and subtract area $B$ and area $C$ : Now clearly the area $A+B+C$ is simply the area of a quarter circle. This is: $$Area(A+B+C)=\frac {\pi r^2}4=\frac \pi4$$ Next, I find the point of intersection in the Cartesian plane of the $\text 2$ lines (where the red and blue lines intersect). I assume the bottom left point on the square represents the coordinates $(0,0)$ . Therefore the $\color{red}{\text {Line 1}}$ has equation: $$y=-2x+1$$ And $\color{blue}{\text {Line 2}}$ lines has equation: $$y=\sqrt{1-(x-1)^2}$$ The intersection is at: $$-2x+1=\sqrt{1-(x-1)^2} \implies (-2x+1)^2=1-(x-1)^2$$ $$\implies 4x^2-4x+1=-x^2+2x$$ $$\implies 5x^2-6x+1=0 \implies (5x-1)(x-1)=0 \implies x=-\frac 15$$ Then we have $y=-2x+1=-2\frac 15 +1 = \frac 35$ so the coordinates of intersection (inside the square) are $\left(\frac 15, \frac 35 \right)$ . Then the area $B$ is simply the area of a triangle, with height $h$ and base $b$ : $$h=\frac 35 \ , \ b=\frac 12 - \frac 15= \frac 3{10}$$ $$\therefore Area(B)=\frac 12 bh= \frac 12 \frac 3{10} \frac 35= \frac 9{100}$$ Now for area $C$ , this is simply the area under the curve of a (semi-) circle between the $x$ -coordinates $x=0$ and $x=\frac 15$ . Clearly this is not the neatest integral, so we just shift the circle coordinates and the area becomes: $$Area(C)=\int_0^{1/5} \sqrt{1-(x-1)^2}dx$$ $$=\int_{-1}^{-4/5} \sqrt{1-x^2}dx=\left[ \frac 12 \left(x\sqrt{1-x^2}+\sin^{-1}(x) \right) \right]_{-1}^{-4/5}$$ $$=-\frac 6{25}+\frac \pi 4 - \frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)$$ Putting it all together we get: $$Area(A)=Area(A+B+C)-Area(B)-Area(C)$$ $$=\frac \pi4- \frac 9{100} - \left[-\frac 6{25}+\frac \pi 4 - \frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)\right]$$ $$=\frac 3{20}+\frac 12 \sin^{-1}\left(\frac 45 \right)$$ $$\approx 0.61365$$ My Question: Is this the best approach?

It is wrapped around the curve of a cylinder with impenetrable barriers in the north and south. This is appealing in its simplicity, but very much unlike real geography. For example, here is a thread discussing the problem and possible solutions . Unfortunately, that thread misses the core of the problem. The real world is homeomorphic to a sphere and all places on the globe are pairwise effectively equivalent. If one has that, then any approximation should be good enough, no matter how distorted the globe becomes. In a strategy game, only the graph truly matters. Therefore, what I think I want are simple finite vertex-transitive planar graphs. It seems to me that any graph that can be embedded in the surface of a 2-sphere can be embedded in a plane, so focusing on planar graphs seems to make my problem easier. Unfortunately, I have some other goals that aren't as easy to define, such as being able to generate a graph for any given number of vertices, and being able to imagine the vertices distributed roughly evenly over the surface of a sphere with edges connecting nearby vertices. Unfortunately I have no precise way to express that second goal, but I imagine it could be captured by some upper bound on the diameter of the graph. At least I know that I prefer small diameter graphs over large diameter graphs. Here is an excellent article I found: https://eudml.org/doc/29561 It only deals with degrees 4 and 5, but I find it hard to imagine how it could be much easier for other degrees. There is only one way to create finite vertex-transitive planar graphs of arbitrary size in that article, and it is effectively lining up vertices along two parallels and connecting them with triangles spanning the equator. Graphs like that would have diameter proportional to the number of vertices and wouldn't cover a sphere well. The article also supplies many other graphs, but each one seems to be individual, with no apparent pattern and so unless I am missing something each would need to be treated as a special case when finding a visually appropriate planar embedding. The planar embedding provided in the article are not appropriate because they are roughly circular instead of allowing vertices on the left side to connect to vertices on the right as one expects in most map projections such as those found in an atlas. So what I would really like is an algorithm with parameter $n$ that produces a planar embedding of some simple vertex-transitive small-diameter graph with $n$ vertices, where $n$ is allowed to be many possible numbers, and where the embedding is suggestive of a map projection in an atlas. In addition to that, there are some smaller problems that would surely be useful toward the greater goal: What is the smallest possible diameter for vertex-transitive planar graphs with $n$ vertices? Or what is the largest diameter known to be smaller than the smallest possible diameter? Given $n$, how can one construct a vertex-transitive planar graph with $n$ vertices that has approximately the smallest possible diameter?

Taking the following pairs of circles: $(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4) $ gives us $ (4.5 + a)^2 + r_1^2 = (r_1 + 4.5)^2 \tag{1} $ $ (4.5 + b)^2 + r_3^2 = (r_3 + 4.5)^2 \tag{2} $ $ (4.5 + a + x_4)^2 + (y_4 - r_1)^2 = (r_1 + r_4)^2 \tag{3}$ $ x_4^2 + y_4^2 = (4.5 + r_4)^2 \tag{4}$ $ (4.5 + b - x_4)^2 + (y_4 - r_3)^2 = (r_3 + r_4)^2 \tag{5}$ In addition to these five equations, we know that point $T$ is given by $ T = P + PT ( \cos \phi, \sin \phi ) $ Where $ \cos \phi = \dfrac{PT}{PQ} = \dfrac{6}{9} = \dfrac{2}{3} $ , therefore, $\sin \phi = \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{3} $ Therefore, $ T = (-4.5, 0) + 6 ( \dfrac{2}{3} , \dfrac{\sqrt{5}}{3} ) = (-0.5 , 2 \sqrt{5} ) $ It follows that $ C_4 = \left(\dfrac{ r_4 + 4.5 }{4.5}\right) T $ And this reads $ x_4 = - 0.5 (1 + \dfrac{2}{9} r_4 ) \tag{6}$ $ y_4 = 2 \sqrt{5} (1 + \dfrac{2}{9} r_4 ) \tag{7}$ With this equation $(4)$ becomes redundant.

44,Existence of a simple convex polygon of specified angle measures,Existence of a simple convex polygon of specified angle measures,,"Given $n \geq 3$ positive reals $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ such that $\alpha_i < 180$ and $\alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n = 180(n - 2)$ , how do we show the existence of an $n$ -sided simple (convex) polygon with interior angles of measure $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ ? This is a simpler version of this question , which considers non-convex polygons as well (but unfortunately has no posted answer). EDIT: I have accepted Jim Ferry's answer, but for completeness I will fill in some details he left implicit. We can guarantee the tangency of each successive ray because we have the freedom to choose when the previous ray ends. If the point of tangency $P'$ determined by the final ray was not equal to our starting point $P$ (the point on the circle from where our first ray birthed), then the ray from $P$ in the opposite direction and the ray from $P'$ as a continuation of the previous ray would intersect at another point $M$ . Now, the $n$ -points on our failed polygon along with $M$ determine the vertices of an $n + 1$ sided polygon, and moreover, $n$ of its interior angles are equal to the $\alpha_i$ . But then, the interior angle $\alpha_{n + 1}$ at $M$ is equal to $180(n - 1) - (\alpha_1 + \dots + \alpha_n) = 180$ , a contradiction. The reason why the process doesn't ""loop too far around"" the circle is given by a similar argument as above.

It is claimed in various sources that the $x_i$ are the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. (see e.g. Wikipedia ). Question: I would like to find a reference for a proof of that fact. (Or a self-contained proof produced here, if it is not too large). I found various sources on this problem, known as the Thomson problem, but could not actually find a paper containing a proof of the four-particle case.

Consider the path $\alpha(t)=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\beta(t))$ . Since $\alpha$ changes only the fourth component, we get $$ \frac{d}{dt}E(\alpha(t))=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{d}{dt}| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-1}. $$ $$ \frac{d}{dt}| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-1}=\frac{d}{dt}(| x_i - \beta(t) |^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}=| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-3}\langle x_i,\dot \beta(t)\rangle. \tag{1} $$ Differentiating again, we get $$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2}| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-1}=| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-3}\big(3| x_i - \beta(t) |^{-2}\langle x_i,\dot \beta(t)\rangle^2+\langle x_i,\ddot \beta(t)\rangle \big)\tag{2}. $$ In particular, for a tetrahedron, we get $$ dE_p(0,0,0,w)=\sum_{i=1}^3 | x_i - x_4 |^{-3}\langle x_i,w\rangle=a^{-3}  \langle \sum_{i=1}^3 x_i,w\rangle=  \langle -x_4,w \rangle=0, $$ where we used the facts that $\sum_{i=1}^4 x_i=0$ , and $\langle x_4,w \rangle$ , since $x \in T_{x_4}\S$ . Here $a=\sqrt\frac{8}{3}$ is the edge length of the tetrahedron. Moreover, $$ a^{3}\frac{d^2}{dt^2}|_{t=0}E(\alpha(t))=3a^{-2}\sum_{i=1}^3\langle x_i,w\rangle^2+\langle \sum_{i=1}^3x_i,\ddot \beta(0)\rangle. $$ Differentiating twice $\langle \beta(t),\beta(t) \rangle=1$ , we get $ \langle x_4,\ddot \beta(0) \rangle=-|w|^2$ , so $$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2}|_{t=0}E(\alpha(t))=3a^{-2}\sum_{i=1}^3\langle x_i,w\rangle^2+|w|^2 \ge 0, $$ and is strictly positive whenever $w \neq 0$ .

Call this random variable $X$ . The area of such a triangle is the sum of its angles minus $\pi$ , so by linearity of expectation the expected value of $X$ is just $3q-\pi$ , where $q$ is the expected value of one of the angles. But by symmetry we can fix one point to be at the north pole and the other to lie on the Prime Meridian, from which it is obvious that the angle distribution is uniform on $[0,\pi]$ . Thus $\mathbb{E}[X]=\pi/2$ , or one-eighth of the sphere's area. However, because the angles are not independent (they cannot sum to less than $\pi$ , for instance), we cannot use this sort of logic to easily infer the values of the second and third moments of this distribution.

54,Understanding the notion of distance between two symmetric convex bodies,Understanding the notion of distance between two symmetric convex bodies,,"I am new to the notion of distance between two symmetric convex bodies , and I am looking for some help in understanding the same. This is also meant to be an informative post for those who are not already familiar with the idea and want to scratch their brains a little on New Year's Eve. I hope you enjoy it! To begin with, I quote the definition with a supplementary figure below: The distance $d(K, L)$ between symmetric convex bodies $K$ and $L$ is the least positive $d$ for which there is a linear image $\tilde L$ of $L$ such that $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ d\tilde L$ . Note that this distance is multiplicative, not additive: in order to get a metric (on the set of linear equivalence classes of symmetric convex bodies), we would need to take $\log d$ instead of $d$ . In particular, if $K$ and $L$ are identical then $d(K, L) = 1$ . From the image it seems that the distance between $K$ and $L$ , is not dependent on the size of $L$ . I mean, we are looking at a linear image $\tilde L$ of $L$ , so looks like all information about the initial size of $L$ is already lost. Is it safe to conclude that $d(K,L)$ does not depend on the size of $L$ , and only on its shape ? Does it depend on the size of $K$ , or that is immaterial too? The author remarks that if $K$ and $L$ are identical , then $d(K,L) = 1$ . What does identical mean? Only the shape , or also the size ? $d(K,L) = 1$ just means $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ \tilde L$ so that $K = \tilde L$ . Again, this says nothing about the size of $L$ originally. To add to this, does the converse hold, i.e. if $d(K,L) = 1$ then are $K$ and $L$ identical? I think so. It is worth noting that $\tilde L$ is defined as the linear image of $L$ , i.e. $$\tilde L = \alpha L = \{\alpha z : z\in L\}$$ where $\alpha \in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ right? This means $\tilde L ⊂ K ⊂ \tilde L$ can be written equivalently as $\alpha L ⊂ K ⊂ d\alpha L$ which gives $$\frac{K}{d\alpha} ⊂ L ⊂ \frac{K}{\alpha} \implies \tilde K \subset L\subset d\tilde K$$ where $\tilde K = \frac{K}{d\alpha}$ . So can we conclude that $d(K,L)$ is symmetric , i.e. $d(K,L) = d(L,K)$ for all $K,L$ ? This is indeed a desirable property, I would not want the distance between two symmetric convex bodies to depend on the order in which they are chosen as arguments to $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ . If $d(K,L) = \beta$ , and $d(L,M) = \gamma$ , what can we say about $d(K,M)$ ? Here are my thoughts, please let me know if this makes sense: From the definition, we know that there exist linear images $\tilde L, \tilde M$ of $L,M$ respectively such that $$\tilde L\subset K\subset \beta\tilde L \text{ and }\tilde M \subset L\subset \gamma\tilde M$$ hold. Since $\tilde M$ is some linear image of $M$ , we might as well write $\tilde M \subset L\subset \gamma\tilde M$ as $\tilde M \subset \tilde L\subset \gamma\tilde M$ by scaling $\tilde M$ by an appropriate factor (the one with which you would relate $L$ and $\tilde L$ ). This brings us to: $$\tilde M \subset \tilde L \subset K \subset \beta \tilde L \subset \beta\gamma\tilde M \implies \tilde M \subset K\subset \beta\gamma\tilde M\implies d(K,M) = \beta\gamma$$ So $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ is multiplicative . Not to mention, this is a little weird and contrary to the notion of distance (between two points) that we are familiar with in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . On Pg.9 of the attached reference (below), it is written that the distance between the cube $K = [-1,1]^n$ and the Euclidean ball $B = B^n_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is at most $\sqrt{n}$ . $d(K,B) \le\sqrt{n}$ makes sense because the largest ball inside the cube has radius $1$ , while the ball that circumscribes the cube has radius $\sqrt{n}$ . Why does the author say ""at most"" in place of ""exactly""? Is it possible that $d(K,B) < n$ ? I think $d(K,B) = n$ . Are there any other interesting properties of $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ that you can think of? These are all the ones that came to my mind. A lot of times it's easier to understand new concepts with examples . It'd be extremely helpful if someone could provide some examples (in the usual $\mathbb{R}^2$ , $\mathbb{R}^3$ as well as in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\ge 4$ ) of bodies $K$ and $L$ , along with $d(K,L)$ and the thought that went into computing the same.

(See the figure below.) Background I was just playing around with functions and I wanted to see if $y=\left|\sin\bigg(\dfrac{\pi x}{2}\bigg)\right|$ (radians) would give a semicircle for the interval $[0,2]$ as the distance of $(1,0)$ is the same from $(0,0)$ , $(2,0)$ and $(1,1)$ , all of which will lie on the curve. The equation of a unit semicircle with its centre at $(1,0)$ is $y=\sqrt{2x-x^2}$ . I know that the curves of both the equations don't resemble each other much but I still thought of approximating the sine function using this because I thought that it could still be combined with another approximation to make a better approximation. Anyway, I did it and for $\phi=x~\mathrm{radians}$ , the value of $\sin\phi$ can to be approximately $\dfrac2\pi\sqrt{\pi x-x^2}$ . It looked like a semi-ellipse and so I verified it to find that it was a semi-ellipse. I thought of using this to derive the equation for an ellipse with it's centre at the origin and the value of $a$ and $b$ being $\dfrac\pi2$ and $1$ respectively.

I observed that as I increased the power, keeping it even, the figure got closer and closer to a square. $y^2=1-\dfrac{4x^{10^{12}}}{\pi^2}$ gave a good approximation of a square.

I could also easily flip that to identify the tangent at that point. I want to identify that magenta path so that I can have the robot follow it.  I want to do this computationally on the fly, which also means I can't plug values into an equation and solve ""interactively"". By looking around this site, I've found that the equation for the normal at is: , which in my case means that: , but I cannot get much further than that, and could really use some help.","\rm P \rm P \rm P (-c, d) \phi (-a, 0) a b (u, v) (x, y) (X, Y) \frac{(X-h)(y-Y)}{a^2}-\frac{(x-X)(Y-k)}{b^2}=0 \frac{(-c+a)(y-d)}{a^2}-\frac{(x+c)d}{b^2}=0","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'conic-sections']"

88,Can the distance from the vertices of a square of integer width to an inscribed circle all be integer?,Can the distance from the vertices of a square of integer width to an inscribed circle all be integer?,,"I'm looking for solutions to the following British Mathematical Olympiad question: Suppose that $ABCD$ is a square and that $P$ is a point which is on the circle inscribed in the square. Determine whether or not it is possible that $PA$, $PB$, $PC$, $PD$ and $AB$ are all integers. I first assumed that $AB=2$, Therefore, the radius of our circle $r=1$, so we have the Cartesian equation of the circle: $$x^{2}+y^{2}=1$$ Which gives us the parametric equations: $$x=\cos{\theta} \\ y=\sin{\theta}$$ Therefore, any arbitrary point $P$ on the circle can be written $P(\cos{\theta},\sin{\theta})$, for some $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$. As we know the position vectors for each of the points $A(1,1)$, $B(1,-1)$, $C(-1,-1)$ and $D(-1,1)$, we can find the vectors: $$\overrightarrow{AP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}-1 \\ \sin{\theta}-1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{BP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}-1 \\ \sin{\theta}+1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{CP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}+1 \\ \sin{\theta}+1\end{pmatrix} \\ \overrightarrow{DP}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos{\theta}+1 \\ \sin{\theta}-1\end{pmatrix}$$ And therefore, we have a general expression for the Euclidean norm of these vectors: $$\|\overrightarrow{AP}\|=\sqrt{3-2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{BP}\|=\sqrt{3-2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\theta\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{CP}\|=\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\theta+\frac{\pi}{4}\right)} \\ \|\overrightarrow{DP}\|=\sqrt{3+2\sqrt{2}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\theta\right)}$$ From this we can see $\not\exists \theta \in [0,2\pi]$ such that $\|\overrightarrow{AP}\|$,$\|\overrightarrow{BP}\|$,$\|\overrightarrow{CP}\|$ and $\|\overrightarrow{DP}\|$ are all integral.
