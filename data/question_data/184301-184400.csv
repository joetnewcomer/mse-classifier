97,Show that a function $f: A \to B$ is surjective if and only if it has a right inverse.,Show that a function  is surjective if and only if it has a right inverse.,f: A \to B,"The textbook I'm reading from defines a right-inverse as follows: Let $f: A \to B$ be a function. A right inverse of $f$ is a function $g: B \to A$ with the property that $f \circ g = id_B$ where $id_B$ is the identity function on $B$ . Now, I'm asked to show that $f: A \to B$ has a right inverse iff it is surjective. The author notes that I may use the axiom of choice in this proof. In other words, they say to assume that given a family of disjoint nonempty subsets of a set, there is a way to choose one element in each member of the family. Proof Attempt: Suppose $f$ has a right inverse. So, there is a function $g: B \to A$ such that $f \circ g = id_B$ . Now, choose an element $b \in B$ . We observe that $g(b) \in A$ and that, by hypothesis, $f(g(b)) = id_B(b) = b$ . So, we have found an element of $A$ (namely $g(b)$ ) whose image under $f$ is $b$ . Since the choice of $b$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $f$ is surjective. For the converse, suppose that $f$ is surjective. We need to construct a function $g: B \to A$ such that $f \circ g = id_B$ for all $x \in B$ . In order to do this, fix $b \in B$ . Since $f$ is surjective, there exists an element $g(b) \in A$ such that $f(g(b)) = b$ . However, we note that there may be more than one element of $A$ whose image is $b$ under $f$ (i.e. there may be more than one possible candidate for $g(b)$ ). In order to isolate a single candidate for $g(b)$ , we proceed by cases. Case 1: The function $f$ sends all elements of $A$ to $b \in B$ . In this case, we may conclude by the surjectivity of $f$ that $b$ is the only element of $B$ . Therefore if we pick an element $s \in A$ , we may define a function $g: B \to A$ where $g(b) = s$ . Then, we simply observe that $f(g(b)) = f(s) = b = id_B(b)$ . Since $b$ is the only element of $B$ , we may immediately conclude that $g$ is a right inverse of $f$ . Case 2: Only the elements in a proper subset of $A$ are mapped to $b$ by the function $f$ . In this case, we can divide the set $A$ into two disjoint subsets $R$ and $S$ where $R$ is the set of all elements in $A$ that get mapped to $b$ by $f$ and $S$ is the set of all elements of $A$ that are not mapped to $b$ by $f$ . By the axiom of choice, I can select a single element $p \in R$ and simply let $g(b) = p$ . This shows that for any element $x$ of $B$ , I can always find a single candidate for $g(x) \in A$ such that $f(g(x)) =x$ . Then, we can properly define a function $g: B \to A$ that sends any $x \in B$ to the single candidate $g(x)$ that we have chosen, and, by construction, $g$ will be a right inverse of $f$ . This completes the proof. Is my proof correct? This is the first time I've done a proof requiring the axiom of choice, so I'm wondering if I've invoked it correctly. Are there any ways that I could improve the proof or details that perhaps I'm missing?","The textbook I'm reading from defines a right-inverse as follows: Let be a function.

Therefore if we pick an element , we may define a function where . Then, we simply observe that . Since is the only element of , we may immediately conclude that is a right inverse of . Case 2: Only the elements in a proper subset of are mapped to by the function . In this case, we can divide the set into two disjoint subsets and where is the set of all elements in that get mapped to by and is the set of all elements of that are not mapped to by . By the axiom of choice, I can select a single element and simply let . This shows that for any element of , I can always find a single candidate for such that . Then, we can properly define a function that sends any to the single candidate that we have chosen, and, by construction, will be a right inverse of . This completes the proof. Is my proof correct? This is the first time I've done a proof requiring the axiom of choice, so I'm wondering if I've invoked it correctly. Are there any ways that I could improve the proof or details that perhaps I'm missing?",f: A \to B f g: B \to A f \circ g = id_B id_B B f: A \to B f g: B \to A f \circ g = id_B b \in B g(b) \in A f(g(b)) = id_B(b) = b A g(b) f b b f f g: B \to A f \circ g = id_B x \in B b \in B f g(b) \in A f(g(b)) = b A b f g(b) g(b) f A b \in B f b B s \in A g: B \to A g(b) = s f(g(b)) = f(s) = b = id_B(b) b B g f A b f A R S R A b f S A b f p \in R g(b) = p x B g(x) \in A f(g(x)) =x g: B \to A x \in B g(x) g f,"['functions', 'proof-verification', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing']"
98,Showing that a function is one-to-one,Showing that a function is one-to-one,,"How can I show if the following function is one-to-one? $$y = x^2 - x \ (x \ge \frac{1}{2})$$ A function is one-to-one if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ then $x_1 = x_2$. So I put in $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the function and tried to see if $x_1(x_1 - 1) = x_2(x_2 - 1)$ made sense. However, I am stuck right here: how do I know that $x_1 = x_2$ in this situation?

99,Finding the range of $\frac{x^2}{x^2-9}$,Finding the range of,\frac{x^2}{x^2-9},"I am a student who is studying about functions (only basic ones) and was practicing till I found this - Finding the range of $$ \frac{x^2}{x^2-9} $$ Since I have only learnt the basics , I can only play around with the numbers and not use limits (which was what I found online). I was Told to try this method -  to try to assign $y=\frac{x^2}{x^2-9}$ This means expressing $x$ in terms of $y$ $x = \sqrt { \frac{9y}{y-1} } $ Now I then go on to find the range of this function - range =$ y \leq 0  $ or $ y>1$ This is simple to do. But what I'm confused with is this - Since Range is all the possible 'y' values obtainable from the domain, then this confuses me because I express x in terms of y. Finding the x value feels like finding the 'domain' for me . I believe I'm having a conceptual problem and I don't understand what does expressing x in terms of y do to help me find the range. does this mean that I can express all other simple functions into x in terms of y to find the range too ? Thanks !! Note : I'm being taught on How to read the domain And range off a function. So I can't use the graphical method .","I am a student who is studying about functions (only basic ones) and was practicing till I found this - Finding the range of $$ \frac{x^2}{x^2-9} $$ Since I have only learnt the basics , I can only play around with the numbers and not use limits (which was what I found online).
