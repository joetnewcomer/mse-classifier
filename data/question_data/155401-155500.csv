It is known that there's a good asymptotic formula for $p(N)$ large $N$ (in my application, $N$ is greater than a billion, so it's very good indeed): $$p(N)\approx \frac{1}{4N\sqrt3}e^{\pi \sqrt{\frac{2N}{3}}}$$ However, I'm not interested in finding the unrestricted partitions: I specifically want the number of partitions that do not repeat any number in the sum.  In the above example, the partitions I'd be interested in are $P_5^*=\{5,4+1,3+2\}$, and $|P^*_5| = p^*(5) =3$.

As another example, for $N=8$ you would have $P_8^*=\{8, 7+1,6+2,5+3,5+2+1,4+3+1\}$, $p^*(8) = 6$. Obviously this grows quite a bit slower than $p(N)$, so here is my question: Is there a large-N asymptotic formula for $p^*(N)$, and if so, what is it? Thank you for your replies.",,"['number-theory', 'asymptotics', 'integer-partitions']"

I'm trying to understand how the smallest positive integer solutions (which are eighty digit numbers) for $$\frac{a}{b+c}+\frac{b}{a+c}+\frac{c}{a+b}=4$$ are calculated. This equation can be expanded out to the elliptic curve $$a^{3}+b^{3}+c^{3}-3\left(a^{2}b+a^{2}c+ab^{2}+ac^{2}+b^{2}c+bc^{2}\right)-5abc=0,$$ which can be transformed to the Weierstrass form $$y^{2}=x^{3}+109x^{2}+224x.$$ This problem for any non-zero integer $N$ (not just $N=4$ ) is presented in the paper An unusual cubic representation problem by Bremner and Macleod (B&M) here . Pitched more at my level, there is also a nice, less technical discussion for $N=4$ given by Alon Amit in his Quora answer here . On page 32, B&M give a generator for the above Weierstrass form as $G=\left(x,y\right)=\left(-4,28\right)$ ,which corresponds to $\left(a,b,c\right)=\left(11,4,-1\right)$ . They don't explain how they choose this $G$ . They then go to say: “The point $9G$ is the smallest multiple of $G$ that corresponds to a positive solution (in which $a,b,c\sim10^{80}$ ).” Now, I can understand most of this problem. I've derived the Weierstrass form from the above cubic. I've derived the equations linking $a,b,c$ and $x,y$ (page 30, B&M). Using the chord and tangent technique, I've calculated the first few values of $nG$ and, when that got too complicated, used SageMath to compute $9G$ and hence the desired positive $a,b,c$ solution.

I'm trying to understand how the smallest positive integer solutions (which are eighty digit numbers) for are calculated. This equation can be expanded out to the elliptic curve which can be transformed to the Weierstrass form This problem for any non-zero integer (not just ) is presented in the paper An unusual cubic representation problem by Bremner and Macleod (B&M) here . Pitched more at my level, there is also a nice, less technical discussion for given by Alon Amit in his Quora answer here . On page 32, B&M give a generator for the above Weierstrass form as ,which corresponds to . They don't explain how they choose this . They then go to say: “The point is the smallest multiple of that corresponds to a positive solution (in which ).” Now, I can understand most of this problem. I've derived the Weierstrass form from the above cubic. I've derived the equations linking and (page 30, B&M). Using the chord and tangent technique, I've calculated the first few values of and, when that got too complicated, used SageMath to compute and hence the desired positive solution. So far, so good.

If $k > n>1$ is an integer, prove that the only solution to $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 = kx_1 x_2\dots x_n$ is $x_1 = x_2 = · · · = x_n = 0.$ Here is my progress. I used vietta jumping. Note that $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2 \ge 0. $ Hence there  are even number of $x_i$ 's such that $|x_i|=-x_i.$ Let them be $a_1,a_2,\dots, a_{2k}.$ Note that we can always replace all the $a_i\rightarrow -a_i$ and it won't effect our equation. So WLOG, we can assume $x_1, x_2 , \dots , x_n$ to be positive ( if anyone is $0$ we get $x_1 = x_2 = · · · = x_n = 0.$ ) Suppose  for some fixed $k$ let $$x_1>x_2>\dots>x_n$$ be the solution such that $(x_1+x_2+\dots +x_n)$ is minimal. Then let $$f(t)=t^2-ktx_2\dots x_n+x_2^2+ \dots + x_n^2.$$ Note that $x_1$ is a root. Let the other root be $w.$ Then since $$w=kx_2\dots x_n -x_1\implies w\in \Bbb Z.$$ And since $$w=\frac{x_2^2+ \dots + x_n^2}{x_1}\implies w>0.$$ So $w$ is a positive integer. Now $$f(x_2)=x_2^2-kx_2^2x_3\dots x_n+x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2\le x_2^2(n-kx_3\dots x_n).$$ Now as $k>n\implies f(x_2)$ is negative. So by IVT, we get $w< x_2<x_1.$ Which is a contradiction as we are getting $(w+x_2+\dots+x_n)<(x_1+\dots+x_n).$ And we had assumed $(x_1+x_2+\dots +x_n)$ is minimal. So $$x_1>x_2\dots >x_n\implies x_1 = x_2 = · · · = x_n = 0.$$ Now if we have $x_1=x_2.$ We get $$2x_1^2+x_2^2+\dots +x_n^2=kx_1^2x_3\dots x_n$$ Now this implies $x_1^2|x_2^2+\dots +x_n^2.$ I don't know how to proceed with this case, since it's not symmetric, so I can't use vietta jumping.

Here's my progress so far: Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(i)$ , then $R:=\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a U.F.D. If $\alpha=x+10i$ , then $\alpha\bar{\alpha}=y^3$ . If $\pi\in R$ is a prime element dividing $\alpha$ and $\bar\alpha$ , then $\pi|(\alpha-\bar\alpha)=20i$ , so $\pi$ divides one of $2$ or $5$ ( $i\in R^{\times}$ ), which factor as follows in $R$ : $2=i\pi_2^2$ where $\pi_2=1+i$ , and $\bar\pi_2=-\pi_2$ $5=\pi_5\bar\pi_5$ where $\pi_5=2+i$ . So the prime factorisation of $\alpha$ and $\bar\alpha$ look like follows: $$\alpha=u\cdot\pi_2^a\pi_5^b\bar\pi_5^c\cdot\rho_1^{e_i}\cdots\rho_n^{e_n}\\ \bar\alpha=v\cdot\pi_2^a\bar\pi_5^b\pi_5^c\cdot\bar\rho_1^{e_i}\cdots\bar\rho_n^{e_n}\\ $$ where $a,b,c,e_i,n\in\mathbb{N}$ ; $u,v\in R^{\times}$ ; and $\rho_i$ primes in $R$ distinct from each other and the $\pi_p$ .

So we have three cases: $b\equiv 0 \mod3 \implies c\equiv 0 \mod3$ , and so $\alpha=\beta^3$ for some $\beta\in R$ . $b\equiv 1 \mod3 \implies c\equiv 2 \mod3$ , and so $\alpha\pi_5^2\bar\pi_5=\beta^3$ for some $\beta\in R$ . $b\equiv 2 \mod3 \implies c\equiv 1 \mod3$ , and so $\alpha\pi_5\bar\pi_5^2=\beta^3$ for some $\beta\in R$ . Letting $\beta=s+it$ , we can 'easily' solve the first case: $$\begin{align}x+10i&=(s+it)^3\\ &=s^3+3is^2t-3st^2-it^3\\ 10&=t(3s^2-t^2)\end{align}$$ So $t|10$ and $s=\pm\sqrt{\frac13(\frac{10}{t}+t^2)}$ , the only integer solution is $(s,t)=(\pm3,5)$ , which yields $(x,y)=(\pm198,34)$ However, I'm struggling to solve the other two cases using the techniques I've familiar with... attempting to do the same thing in the second case got me this: $$\begin{align}10x-50&=a^3-3ab^2\\100+5x&=3a^3b-b^3\end{align}$$ From this we have $250 = 6a^2b-2b^3-a^3+3ab^2$ , which means $b-a\equiv 1 \mod3$ ... but I'm not sure how this is helpful.

Let $\varepsilon$ be the map $n \mapsto k$ , and let $\sigma$ be the map $n \mapsto a$ . Now define two auxiliary functions \begin{align} 	a(n-1) &= \sigma(n) \cdot 3^{ \varepsilon(n) } \text{,} \\ 	b(n+1) &= \sigma(n) \cdot 1^{ \varepsilon(n) } \text{,} \end{align} and function composition \begin{align} 	T(n) &= b(a(n)) \text{.} \end{align} Collatz problem concerns the question of whether the function iterates reach 1, for all $n>0$ . This is nothing new. I just formulated the Collatz problem in a very complicated manner. Instead of tracking $n$ directly, I now track the pair $(\sigma(n), \varepsilon(n))$ . The point of this formulation is that I can verify the convergence of the problem for all $\sigma(\cdot) < \Sigma$ and $\varepsilon(\cdot) < E$ . This is much easier than verifying the problem directly on $n$ because pairs of values $(\sigma(n), \varepsilon(n))$ take much smaller magnitudes than the $n$ itself. For example, I have verified the convergence for all $(\sigma, \varepsilon)$ below $(2^{44}, 14)$ . This was fairly fast on my desktop computer.

I don't need to show results of this sort, but it has come up enough that I'm curious how one might approach it. As for an example I have in mind: After playing around with SAGE, in level 2, the modular form $\Delta$ factors into $\delta\gamma^2$, where $\delta$ and $\gamma$ are modular forms of level 2 (this I think I can verify). However, it also appears that $\delta$ and $\gamma$ have the following $q$-expansions: \begin{align*} \delta &= q\prod_{n\geq 1}{(1+a(n)q^{n})^{8}}, \end{align*} where  \begin{align*} a(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } n \equiv 1\pmod{2} \\ 0 & \mbox{if } n \equiv 2\pmod{4}\\ -1 & \mbox{if } n\equiv 0\pmod{4} \end{cases} \end{align*} and  \begin{align*} \gamma &= \prod_{n\geq 1}{(1-q^n)^{16b(n)}}, \end{align*} where  \begin{align*} b(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } n \equiv 1\pmod{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & \mbox{if } n \equiv 0\pmod{2}.\end{cases} \end{align*} Finally, if you plug in the product expansions for $\delta$, $\gamma$ in $\Delta = \delta\gamma^2$ and rearrange terms, you get the product expansion for $\Delta$. Now, if we knew that the product formulas were actually modular forms, then the rest should quickly follow. However, how might one show that a power series is from a modular form?

I think I have an elementary proof now but usually in the Collatz-problem your proofs are faulty, so I better ask for a crosscheck. As proposed in the MSE.meta I'll put the problem-description in this question and post my attempted proof in an own answer. The notion of 1-cycles begin with the definition of increasing steps $a_{k+1} = {3a_k +1\over 2} $ if $a_k$ is odd and decreasing steps $a_{k+1} = {a_k\over 2} $ if $a_k$ is even. If we consider the simple type of a cycle, which occurs if $N$ increasing steps are followed by $B$ decreasing steps, then let us call this with Steiner, Simons, de Weger and others the ""1-cycle"" of length $S=N+B$ . Notes: 1) here the $N$ contains the number of increasing steps and defines, that the term $3^N$ will become involved. It is my main varying parameter. 2) Depending on $N$ , there is $S$ such that $2^S \gt 3^N \gt 2^{S-1}$ so in fact $S$ is a function of $N$ , and can also be determined by $S(N)=\lceil N \log(3)/\log(2) \rceil$ . I used the symbol $S$ here to indicate it is the sum of the exponents of all powers of $2$ which are involved and also the shorter form $S$ instead $S(N)$ . 3) I introduce also the short-name for the difference $B = S-N$ , thus also depending on $N$ . $B$ is simply the number of purely decreasing steps after the $N$ purely increasing steps. With Steiner, we can state, that an initial number a which we wish to increase by N steps must have the form $a = 2^N \cdot k -1$ ; here we can use any odd integer $k \gt 0$ . The result of that transformation, let's call it b has then the form $b=3^N \cdot k -1 $ with the same parameter k . If b is then transformed by B decreasing steps and reaches c then c has the form $c={3^N \cdot k\ - 1 \over 2^B}$ If we want a cycle then this requires $c=a$ and this is also the ""1-cycle"" where $a$ is the minimal element.

90,Least Prime in Arithmetic Progression Conjecture,Least Prime in Arithmetic Progression Conjecture,,"Let $q>2$ be a prime, and let $p(a,q)$ denote the least prime in arithmetic progression $$a+nq,$$ where $n$ runs through the positive integers. It is conjectured that $p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1$ . Research suggests that the above statement is related to Linnik's theorem, albeit a special case. How would one go about determining if this conjecture is valid/interesting or not and where would one start to prove this true or false and would proving something like this in any way help to decrease the bound of $L$ in Linnik's Theorem? Background: The Pocklington Criterion can be used to prove the primality of an integer $N$ , given a partial factorization of $N-1$ , specifically given that $N-1$ has a prime factor $q>\sqrt{N}-1$ . For a given odd prime $q$ , the Pocklington Criterion can be used to test exactly $\frac{q+1}{2}$ integers for primality, $1+nq$ , where $n=2, 4, ..., q+1$ . For the special case $q=2$ , $n=1,2,3$ can be tested for primality, which is $3$ , $5$ and $7$ . As an example, take $q=7$ , the following $4$ integers can be tested: $1+2(7)=15$ $1+4(7)=29$ $1+6(7)=43$ $1+8(7)=57$ From this list it is easy to see that $29$ and $43$ are primes and the Pocklington Criterion will confirm this fact. Odd $n$ terms are omitted as they are all divisible by $2$ . What we can now do is use these two primes and generate other primes. What I am interested in, and where the question comes from, is whether this process continues ad infinitum or not. Can we generate an infinite number of primes given a starting prime $q$ , or stated differently, can the Pocklington Criterion be used to generate at least one prime given a starting prime $q$ . The other part of the question is whether this is in any way useful. We already know, according to Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, that there are an infinite number of primes of the form $1+nq$ . Linnik's Theorem has to do with what the smallest prime in an Arithmetic Progression is. Research Update: There are a couple of theorems and conjectures about what the smallest prime in an Arithmetic Progression is, and these are mostly based on Linnik's Theorem. It is conjectured that $p(a,d)<d^2$ . Heath-Brown, Roger (1992). ""Zero-free regions for Dirichlet L-functions, and the least prime in an arithmetic progression"". This seems to be the smallest conjectured bound. If the above conjecture is true, then the conjecture that $p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1$ is also true, and not necessarily useful. So, the conjecture in the question is not unique. What seems to be unique is the very specific bound $p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1$ . The other part that seems to be unique is the thinking that led to the conjecture. Research Update: Referencing the answer below, $q_1q_2+1=r$ , where $r$ is the smallest value such that $r=1+tq_1=1+sq_2$ , with $q_2>q_1$ . This is only true if $gcd(q_1,q_2)=1$ . So $q_1(q_1+1)+1$ is just the largest value of the arithmetic progression $1+tq_1$ that is less than the smallest possible value of $r$ , which we get when $q_2-q_1=2$ . So the bound in the question does not necessarily have anything to do with the smallest prime in arithmetic progression, but it is an interesting boundary nonetheless.","Let be a prime, and let denote the least prime in arithmetic progression where runs through the positive integers.

As an example, take , the following integers can be tested: From this list it is easy to see that and are primes and the Pocklington Criterion will confirm this fact. Odd terms are omitted as they are all divisible by . What we can now do is use these two primes and generate other primes. What I am interested in, and where the question comes from, is whether this process continues ad infinitum or not. Can we generate an infinite number of primes given a starting prime , or stated differently, can the Pocklington Criterion be used to generate at least one prime given a starting prime . The other part of the question is whether this is in any way useful. We already know, according to Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions, that there are an infinite number of primes of the form . Linnik's Theorem has to do with what the smallest prime in an Arithmetic Progression is. Research Update: There are a couple of theorems and conjectures about what the smallest prime in an Arithmetic Progression is, and these are mostly based on Linnik's Theorem. It is conjectured that . Heath-Brown, Roger (1992). ""Zero-free regions for Dirichlet L-functions, and the least prime in an arithmetic progression"". This seems to be the smallest conjectured bound. If the above conjecture is true, then the conjecture that is also true, and not necessarily useful. So, the conjecture in the question is not unique. What seems to be unique is the very specific bound . The other part that seems to be unique is the thinking that led to the conjecture. Research Update: Referencing the answer below, , where is the smallest value such that , with . This is only true if . So is just the largest value of the arithmetic progression that is less than the smallest possible value of , which we get when . So the bound in the question does not necessarily have anything to do with the smallest prime in arithmetic progression, but it is an interesting boundary nonetheless.","q>2 p(a,q) a+nq, n p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1 L N N-1 N-1 q>\sqrt{N}-1 q \frac{q+1}{2} 1+nq n=2, 4, ..., q+1 q=2 n=1,2,3 3 5 7 q=7 4 1+2(7)=15 1+4(7)=29 1+6(7)=43 1+8(7)=57 29 43 n 2 q q 1+nq p(a,d)<d^2 p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1 p(1,q)\le q(q+1)+1 q_1q_2+1=r r r=1+tq_1=1+sq_2 q_2>q_1 gcd(q_1,q_2)=1 q_1(q_1+1)+1 1+tq_1 r q_2-q_1=2","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'arithmetic-progressions']"
