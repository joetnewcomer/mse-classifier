This then means that the integral is equal to $$S_1 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1} \right) \ln(n)$$ Through telescoping, this can be rewritten as $$S_2 = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{\ln(n)-\ln(n-1)}{n}$$ I don't know how $S_2$ or either of the other representations can be solved, but I am fairly certain that it converges since numerical approximations have given me an answer around $0.788$ .

4,A difficult logarithmic integral and its relation to alternating Euler Sums,A difficult logarithmic integral and its relation to alternating Euler Sums,,"The following integral was recently brought up in this thread on AoPS. $$\mathfrak I~=~\int_0^1\frac{\log(1-x)\log^2(x)\log(1+x)}{1+x}\mathrm dx\tag1$$ It is reasonable to ask for a closed-form of $(1)$ as similar (namely taking $x$ instead of $1+x$ as numerator) have known closed-form representations. The crux here appears to be the inherent alternating structure induced by both, the $1+x$ within the numerator as well as in the logarithm. Let me elaborate on this by converting this integral into a sum. Using the generating function for the harmonic numbers combined with various well-known results we may obtain $$\small\begin{align*} \int_0^1\frac{\log(1-x)\log^2(x)\log(1+x)}{1+x}\mathrm dx&=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}H_n\int_0^1x^n\log^2(x)\log(1-x)\mathrm dx\\ &=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}H_n\left(\frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dn^2}\left[-\frac{\psi^{(0)}(n+2)+\gamma}{n+1}\right]\right)\\ &=\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^nH_n\left(2\frac{\psi^{(0)}(n+2)+\gamma}{(n+1)^3}-2\frac{\psi^{(1)}(n+2)}{(n+1)^2}+\frac{\psi^{(2)}(n+2)}{n+1}\right)\\ &=2\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^nH_n\left(\frac{H_{n+1}}{(n+1)^3}-\frac{\zeta(2)-H_{n+1}^{(2)}}{(n+1)^2}-\frac{\zeta(3)-H_{n+1}^{(3)}}{n+1}\right)\\ &=2\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^{n+1}\left(H_n-\frac1n\right)\left(\frac{H_n}{n^3}-\frac{\zeta(2)-H_n^{(2)}}{n^2}-\frac{\zeta(3)-H_n^{(3)}}n\right) \end{align*}$$ So, basically we are left with alternating sums of the form $\sum\limits_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n a_n$ where $a_n$ is a coefficient up to a weight of $5$ (by the usual definition of weight). Expanding the parenthesis (!) we are left with the following (ordered by weight and complexity) $$\small\frac12\mathfrak I-\frac54\zeta(2)\zeta(3)=\zeta(3)\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}n+\zeta(2)\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^2}+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^4}-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}\\\small-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_nH_n^{(2)}}{n^2}-\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_nH_n^{(3)}}n+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n^3}+\sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n^{(3)}}{n^2}$$ I am not entirely sure about splitting the sum as the first series is only conditionally convergent instead of absolutely convergent as the rest. However, the first two series fall rather easily by using the generating function again and integrating once and twice, respectively, giving us the following results. \begin{align*} \sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}n&=\frac12\zeta(2)-\frac12\log^2(2)\tag2\\ \sum_{n\geqslant1}(-1)^n\frac{H_n}{n^2}&=-\frac58\zeta(3)\tag3 \end{align*} While this approach essentially works for the third sum too the calculations are nearly impossible by hand and WolframAlpha already returns this monstrosity for a denominator of only $n^3$ . But, let's put this aside as ""in-fact-doable"" (even though the result may not admit a closed-form in terms of known constants alone). For the remaining series - except the sixth - I have a vague idea. Making use of more generating functions, namely the following, one can get these sums. Anyway, I do not know if the so-occurring integrals are easier than $(1)$ or in the worst case not even harder. $$\small\begin{align*} \sum_{n\geqslant1}H_n^{(p)}x^n&=\frac{\operatorname{Li}_p(x)}{1-x}\tag4\\ \sum_{n\geqslant1}H_n^2x^n&=\frac1{1-x}(\log^2(1-x)+\operatorname{Li}_2(x))\tag5\\ \sum_{n\geqslant1}H_nH_n^{(2)}x^n&=\frac1{1-x}\left(\frac12\log(x)\log^2(1-x)+\operatorname{Li}_3(x)+\operatorname{Li}_3(1-x)\tag6\\ -\zeta(2)\log(1-x)-\zeta(3)\right) \end{align*}$$ However, there is no similar formula I am aware of to generate $H_nH_n^{(3)}$ , so this part remains unknown. It might be possible to shorten things up by considering linear combinations of some of the occuring series but honestly speaking I am not longer able to keep track of all what is going on. I have a few questions, but I would be glad for answers referring to only one of them too. $\textbf{Q. 1}$ What is the current state of art concerning regular alternating Euler Sums?

21,Asymptotic expansion of $\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt$,Asymptotic expansion of,\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt,"Using the method of stationary phase, I was able to obtain the first term of the asymptotic expansion of the following integral, as $x \rightarrow \infty$: $$\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt \sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2x}} e^{i({x-\pi/4})}.$$ However, I'm interested in finding a few more terms of the asymptoptic expansion, so I guess I have to apply the method of steepest descent. This was my reasoning: We have an integral of the form $$\int \limits_0^{\pi/2} e^{x\phi (t)}dt $$ with $$\tag{1} \phi(t) = i\cos t.$$ We want to find paths for which $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t)$ is constant and determine which directions along these curves cause $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t)$ to decrease. Let’s start by taking $t=x +iy$ on (1) , so we can find the real and imaginary parts of $\phi(t)$; we get: $$\phi(x + iy) = i\cos(x + iy) = \sin x\sinh y + i\cos x\cosh y$$ so $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t) = \sin x\sinh y$ and $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t) = \cos x\cosh y.$ Thus, the paths that make $\operatorname{Im} \phi(t)$ constant constitute the family of curves $$\tag{2} \cos x\cosh y = k, \, k \in \mathbb{R}.$$ There are two curves which belong to family (2) that are useful in the context of this problem, as they will allow us to follow a path from $t=0$ to $t=\pi/2$   in the steepest descent sense, namely $$\gamma_1(x,y) = \cos x\cosh y - 1$$ which will takes us from $(x,y)=(0,0)$  to $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon,-R \right)$, with $R$ very large and $\epsilon$ a small positive quantity (this path will be named $C_1$), and $$\gamma_3(x,y) = \cos x\cosh y $$ which will takes us from $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2},-R \right)$  to $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2},0 \right)$ (this path will be named $C_3$). To join paths $C_1$ and $C_3$, we need to resort to another path $C_2$, parallel to the x-axis, which will takes us from $(x,y)=\left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\epsilon,-R \right)$ to $(x,y)= \left( \frac{\pi}{2},-R \right)$. These are the contour lines of $\operatorname{Re} \phi(t) = \sin x\sinh y$ (darker means smaller) So, to apply the method of steepest descent we should take the following contour We have then $$\int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt = \int\limits_{{C_1}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  + \int\limits_{{C_2}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  + \int\limits_{{C_3}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}.$$ Now, making  $R \rightarrow \infty$, the lenght of $C_2$ becomes arbitrarily small as does the integrand, which decays exponentially in the direction of steepest descent, so the contribution of this integral is negligible. To compute the contour integral along path $C_1$, we use a substitution of the form $\phi(t) = -u + ik$, so that the exponential in the integrand becomes $\exp (-xu + ix)$, as  $k=1$ on $C_1$. We then have $$t = \arccos (1 + iu) \to \frac{dt}{du} = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{1- (1 + iu)^2}} \Rightarrow dt =  \frac{1 - i}{2 \sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}}du$$ and, from $u(t) = i(1- \cos t) = i - \sin x\sinh y - i\underbrace {\cos x\cosh y}_{ = 1} = - \sin x\sinh y$, we get $$u(0 + i0) = - \sin 0 \sinh 0 = 0$$ and $$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\infty \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right) \sinh(-\infty) = + \infty.$$ We finally arrive at $$\tag{3} \int\limits_{C_1} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  =  e^{ix} \int\limits_0^{+\infty} {\frac{1 - i}{2\sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}} e^{-xu} du}.$$ Regarding the contour integral along path $C_3$, we use a substitution of the form $\phi(t) = -u + ik$, so that the exponential in the integrand becomes $\exp (-xu)$, as  $k=0$ on $C_3$. We then have $$t = \arccos (iu) \to \frac{dt}{du} = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} \Rightarrow dt =  - \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}}du$$ and, from $u(t) = - i \cos t) = - \sin x\sinh y - i\underbrace {\cos x\cosh y}_{ = 0} = - \sin x\sinh y$, we get $$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-i\infty \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) \sinh (-\infty) = +\infty$$ and $$u\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + i0 \right) = - \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} \right) \sinh(0) = 0.$$ We finally arrive at $$\tag{4} \int\limits_{C_3} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt}  =  \int\limits_0^{+\infty} {\frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} e^{-xu} du}.$$ We are now able to find the asymptotic series for both (3) and (4) , using Watson’s lemma. The first result we need is the following MacLaurin series $$\tag{5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 4x}} \sim \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{(2k)!x^k}{(n!)^2}}. $$ Now, making the substitution $x=-iu/8$ in (5) and multiplying by $(1-i) / u^{1/2} = \sqrt{2} e^{-i \pi/4} / u^{1/2}$, we get $$\tag{6} \frac{1 - i}{2 \sqrt{u} \sqrt{1 + iu/2}} \sim \frac{e^{-i \pi/4}}{\sqrt{2}} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{(2k)! (-i)^k u^{k-1/2}}{8^k (k!)^2}}.$$ Similarly, making the substitution $x=-u^2/4$ in (5) and multiplying by $i$, we get $$\tag{7} \frac{i}{\sqrt{1 + u^2}} \sim \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  {\frac{i(2k)! (-1)^k u^{2k}}{4^k (k!)^2}}.$$ Finally, applying Watson’s lemma we arrive at $$\begin{align} \int\limits_0^{\pi / 2} {e^{ix\cos t}}dt &\sim \int\limits_{{C_1}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt} + \int\limits_{{C_3}} {{e^{ix\cos t}}dt} \\ &\sim {\frac{e^{i(x - \pi/4)}}{\sqrt{2}} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty  \frac{(2k)!

26,Killing singularities of differential forms via multiplying with a function which is 1 on the boundary of the domain of integration.,Killing singularities of differential forms via multiplying with a function which is 1 on the boundary of the domain of integration.,,"The most famous differential form is probably $$\textrm{d}\theta =  \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}x + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}y$$ Warning: $\textrm{d}\theta$ , despite appearances, is not the exterior derivative of any function $\theta : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ .  It is locally of such a form however.  On any simply connected open set $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^2-\{(0,0)\}$ one can define a function $\theta_U : U \to \mathbb{R}$ whose differential agrees with $\textrm{d}\theta$ on $U$ . There are several ways to integrate this around the unit circle: Parameterize the unit circle and integrate in the parameter space. Cover the unit circle with simply connected open sets where the form is exact (for instance $\textrm{d}\theta = \textrm{d} \arctan(\frac{y}{x}) $ when $x>0$ ), chop the circle into pieces whose endpoints are in the overlaps of the open sets, and use the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals on each segment. There is a third way which doesn't seem to be discussed as often:  multiply this form by a smooth function which kills the singularity at the origin, but does not alter the form on the unit circle, and then apply Stoke's theorem.  Here is that calculation in detail: $$ \begin{align} \int_{S^1}  \frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}x + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}y & = \int_{S^1}  (x^2+y^2)\left(\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}x + \frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\textrm{d}y\right)\\ &=\int_{S^1} -y \textrm{d}x + x\textrm{dy}\\ &= \int_{D(0,1)} \textrm{d}\left( -y \textrm{d}x + x\textrm{dy} \right)\\ &= \int_{D(0,1)} 2 \textrm{d}x \wedge \textrm{d}y\\ &= 2\pi \end{align} $$ Here the first equality is justified by the fact that $x^2+y^2 = 1$ on $S^1$ , the third equality is Stoke's theorem, and the last equality is true because the area of the unit disk is $\pi$ . It is interesting that this argument relates the circumference of the circle to its area via Stoke's theorem.  A slight variant of this calculation can prove that $C = 2A/r$ for any circle of radius $r$ . This trick seems widely applicable:  if you have a form which is defined off of a singular set, you can integrate along a boundary by first multiplying the form by a function which is 1 on the boundary and kills the singularity, and then applying Stoke's theorem to the new ""singularity free"" form.  It has the feeling of being an important trick to me, one which can be used over and over again in many diverse situations. My question:  where has this trick been used?

I get the wrong answer so could you please say what I am doing wrong? We start with the substitution $z = e^{i\theta}$. Then $d\theta = \frac{dz}{iz}$ and $\cos \theta = (z + z^{-1})/2$. So our integral now looks like $\frac{1}{i2^{2n}}\int_{|z|=1} \frac{(z+z^{-1})^{2n}}{z}dz$. The inner part of the integral has a singularity at $z = 0$. So we expand it as a Laurent series around the origin. $\frac{(z+z^{-1})^{2n}}{z} = \frac{1}{z}\sum_{t=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{t}z^{2n-t}z^{-t} = \sum_{t=0}^{2n}\binom{2n}{t}z^{2n-2t-1}$. The residue of that beast is the coefficient of $1/z$, that is $\binom{2n}{n}$. Therefore the integral is equal to $\frac{2\pi i}{i2^{2n}}\binom{2n}{n} = \frac{\pi}{2^{2n-1}}\binom{2n}{n}$.

For convenience I shall copy and paste the sections that are troubling me. Here is the drawing alongside: We will construct $f(z)$ so that it has a branch cut on $[0, 3]$ , shown in red in the diagram. To do this, we choose two branches of the logarithm, setting $z^{\frac{3}{4}} = \exp \left (\frac{3}{4}\log(z) \right )$ where $-\pi \le \arg(z) < \pi $ and $(3-z)^{\frac{1}{4}} = \exp \left (\frac{1}{4} \log(3-z) \right )$ where $0 \le \arg(3-z) < 2\pi$ I don't understand the branch choice. Looking at the contour, I would have written the opposite: $0\leq \arg z<2\pi$ and $-\pi\leq \arg (3-z)<\pi$ . Why is this flawed thinking? Sorry if that's a very silly question. Let $z=r$ (in the limit, i.e. as the two green circles shrink to radius zero), where $0 ≤ r ≤ 3$ . Along the upper segment, we find that $f(z)$ has the value: $$r^{\frac{3}{4}} \exp(\tfrac{3}{4}0 \pi i) (3-r)^{\frac{1}{4}} \exp(\tfrac{1}{4}2 \pi i) = i \, r^{\frac{3}{4}} (3-r)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ and along the lower segment, $$r^{\frac{3}{4}} \exp(\tfrac{3}{4}0 \pi i) (3-r)^{\frac{1}{4}} \exp(\tfrac{1}{4}0 \pi i) = r^{\frac{3}{4}} (3-r)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ It follows that the integral of $\dfrac{f(z)}{5-z}$ along the upper segment is $-iI$ in the limit, and along the lower segment, $I$ . I do not understand why it is $-iI$ along the upper segment rather than $iI$ . $$(1-i) I = -2\pi i \left( \mathrm{Res}\left( \frac{f(z)}{5-z},5\right) + \mathrm{Res}\left( \frac{f(z)}{5-z} ,\infty\right)\right)$$ This is where I realised that I must be completely misunderstanding the idea. From what I understood, neither the singularity at $2$ nor that at $\infty$ are in the contour, so I do not see how they come into play and how the residue theorem is being used. I realise this is the whole point of all the previous working, but I don't understand what is going on. Also, if instead the poles were not on the real line - for instance, if we were considering: $$\int_0^3 \frac{f(x)}{1+x^4}\,dx$$ How would one adapt the residue calculations?

The Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma fails since $\frac{\cos(x^3/3)}{x}$ is not $L^1$.  The function $\cos(x^3/3)$ does not have compact support on $\mathbb{R}$.  And integration by parts schemes haven't appeared to be illuminating. So, is there a ""better, stronger, faster"" approach?",,"['integration', 'limits', 'definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals']"

46,Integral of a function over the Koch Curve. Is it rigourous enough?,Integral of a function over the Koch Curve.

In terms of iteration, the Koch curve at an iteration $i$ can be constructed from $4^i$ lines of lenth $3^{-i}$. The measure of a particular iterate line is thus given by $4^{-i}$ since $\mu(K)$=1.

Let $$I = \int^1_0 \frac{\tanh^{-1} x}{x} \ln [(1 + x)^3 (1 - x)] \, dx.$$ Since $$\tanh^{-1} x = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left (\frac{1 + x}{1 - x} \right ),$$ the above integral, after rearranging, can be rewritten as $$I = \frac{3}{2} \int^1_0 \frac{\ln^2 (1 + x)}{x} \, dx - \int^1_0 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \ln (1 + x)}{x} \, dx - \frac{1}{2} \int^1_0 \frac{\ln^2 (1 - x)}{x} \, dx.\tag1$$ Each of the above three integrals can be found. The results are: $$\int^1_0 \frac{\ln^2 (1 + x)}{x} \, dx = \frac{1}{4} \zeta (3).$$ For a proof, see here or here . $$\int^1_0 \frac{\ln (1 - x) \ln (1 + x)}{x} \, dx = -\frac{5}{8} \zeta (3).$$ For a proof, see here . And $$\int^1_0 \frac{\ln^2 (1 - x)}{x} \, dx = 2 \zeta (3).$$ For a proof of this last one, see here .
