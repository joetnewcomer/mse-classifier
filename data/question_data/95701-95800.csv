57,Counting Fractional Linear Transformations,Counting Fractional Linear Transformations,,"This is a problem from Ahlfors' Complex analysis, Section 3.5. In an obvious way, which we shall not try to make precise, a family of [Möbius] transformations depends on a certain number of real parameters. How many real parameters are there in the family of all [fractional] linear transformations? How many in the families of hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic transformations? How many fractional linear transformations leave a given circle invariant? I'm not really sure what he's getting at. I am wondering my thoughts below are in the general direction of what kind of reasoning he's looking for. All fractional linear transformations $Tz = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ looks like it has 4 complex numbers, so at first I thought there should be 8 real numbers involved. But, many collections give the same transformation, so if you normalize using the determinant, you're left with three degrees of freedom in complex numbers. So you need 6 real parameters. Hyperbolic transformations You can write these like $\frac{Tz - a}{Tz - b} = k \frac{z-a}{z-b}$, where $k$ is real, and $a$ and $b$ are complex. So you need 5 real numbers to specify one. Elliptic transformations Pretty much the same as hyperbolic, except $k = e^{i\theta}$. So also 5 parameters in this case.

In an obvious way, which we shall not try to make precise, a family of [Möbius] transformations depends on a certain number of real parameters. How many real parameters are there in the family of all [fractional] linear transformations? How many in the families of hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic transformations? How many fractional linear transformations leave a given circle invariant? I'm not really sure what he's getting at. I am wondering my thoughts below are in the general direction of what kind of reasoning he's looking for. All fractional linear transformations $Tz = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ looks like it has 4 complex numbers, so at first I thought there should be 8 real numbers involved. But, many collections give the same transformation, so if you normalize using the determinant, you're left with three degrees of freedom in complex numbers. So you need 6 real parameters.

In the second stage I apply a 1D FFT to every column, but since the row values are now complex this will be a complex to complex FFT with no redundancy in the output. Hence I only need width / 2 points in the horizontal axis, but you still need height points in the vertical axis.
