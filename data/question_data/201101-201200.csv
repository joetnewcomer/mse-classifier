Suppose that we have a smooth function $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ , and note $\pi_A:S\to A$ and $\pi_B:S\to B$ the canonical projections. My question is: Is there a (generic) property we can ask $F$ to check in order to make $\tilde{f}=f\circ\pi_A:S\to\mathbb{R}$ a Morse function?

Since this set is generically a manifold of dimension $\dim S-\dim A=\dim A+\dim B-\dim C-\dim A=\dim B-\dim C$ , the function $\tilde{f}$ would be at most Morse-Bott as soon as $\dim B>\dim C$ , so to avoid this case we can require $A$ to be non compact and $f$ to have no critical points).

11,Intuition of local connection forms,Intuition of local connection forms,,"In the past I had the feeling that I understood the mathematics and ideas behind principal connections and connection one-forms rather well. However, while trying to explain these ideas in simple terms to a nonmathematical audience, I noticed that my understanding might not extend flawlessly beyond the pure formulas. When you have a principal $G$ -bundle $\pi:P\rightarrow M$ , you can canonically define the vertical subbundle as the kernel of the projection $\pi_*$ . A connection is then equivalent to a choice of complement inside the tangent bundle $TP$ . Locally, where $P|_U\cong U\times G$ , one can identify the vertical spaces with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ . A complement can then be defined by assigning to every basis $\partial_i$ of a tangent space on $M$ a ''horizontal lift'' $$\widetilde{\partial}_i:=\partial_i+\chi_i,$$ where $\chi_i\in\mathfrak{g}$ (these two terms should be mapped in the right way to a tangent space of $P|_U$ and extended to a local frame). The associated connection one-form $\omega$ on $P$ is then, as far as I understand, the form that assigns to any vector field on $P$ , at any point, the contribution in $\mathfrak{g}$ that does not arise from these $\chi_i$ 's: $$X = \sum_i\lambda_i(\partial_i+\chi_i) + \omega(X),$$ for some scalars numbers $\lambda_i$ . It measures the change in the fibres that does not arise from a mere change on the base manifold. When we then, locally, pullback the connection one-form $\omega$ to a one-form on the patch $U$ , we get $$A = s^*\omega.$$ By definition of the pullback I would then think that this evaluates to the following formula on any vector field: $A(Y) = \omega(s_*Y)$ . By then combining the above statements, I would expect that $A$ assigns to any vector field on $M$ the difference between its pushforward (along a section) to the bundle and its horizontal lift, resulting in a linear combination of the $\chi_i$ 's.

What ""deep underlying truth"" about the topology of complex varieties does this theorem reveal?

I want here the point to lie anywhere on the plane. Find the value of  x0  at which the area of the pedal curve of the ellipse with respect to the point P( x0 , 0) is minimized My attempt: Let the tangent line be represented as $\tau$ and let the signed  distance from tangent line to point be $d_{\tau}(p)$ , finally let the unit normal vector of the tangent line be $n$ . Note that $p$ is given as an ordered pair of coordinates, in whatever coordinate system you use. Now, the foot of perpendicular is given as: $$f_{\tau} (p) = p-d_{\tau} (p) n$$ Now, we can parameterize the unit normal as a function of $t$ $$ F_{\tau} (p,t) = f_{\tau} (p) = p - d_{\tau} \left( p\right) n(t)$$ Now, we want the area of Pedal curve, we can use the gauss shoelace formula for this, treating $F_{\tau}(t)$ as a position vector: $$\begin{align} \int F_{\tau} (t,p)  \times \frac{d}{dt} F_{\tau} (t,p)  dt  = \int  \left[ p - d_{\tau}(p) n\right] \times \left[-d_{\tau}(p) \frac{dn}{dt}-\frac{d (d_{\tau}(p) )}{dt} n\right] dt=\\ \int \left[ d_{\tau}(p) \frac{dn}{dt}+n \frac{d (d_{\tau}(p) )}{dt} \right]\times \left[ p-d_{\tau}(p)n\right] dt= \int \frac{dn}{dt} \times \left[ p d_{\tau}(p)- (d_{\tau} (p))^2 n \right] + \frac{d (d_{\tau}(p) )}{dt}n \times \left[ p\right]dt \end{align}$$ The final problem is to find a point $p$ such that the integral: $$I(p) = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{dn}{dt} \times \left[ p d_{\tau} (p) - d_{\tau}(p)^2 n \right] + \frac{d (d_{\tau}(p) )}{dt}n \times \left[ p\right] dt$$ Is minimized. Brute forcing by taking the parameterization $(a \cos \theta, b \sin \theta)$ of ellipse and the normals and $\frac{dn}{dt}$ calculations became literal hell.

Then there's is a smooth maximal atlas $\mathfrak{E}$ such that $(E,\mathfrak{C})$ is a smooth manifold with dimension $m+r$ and $\pi :E\to M$ is a smooth map. What I did: I proved the above proposition. However the length of my proof may hide errors that I'm not being able to notice (so that proposition may even be false). For this reason I would like to know if there is a simpler proof. Also I would like to know if there is a book that contains the proof of the previous proposition. If that proposition is true, then $(\pi ,E,M)$ is a vector bundle because we can construct a $\mathbb{R}$ -vector space structure in $\pi^{-1}[p]$ for all $p\in U_i$ and $i\in I$ such that $\varphi _p:\pi^{-1}[p]\to \mathbb{R}^r$ given by $\varphi_p (x):=\pi _2\circ \varphi_i (x)$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces in which $\pi _2:U\times \mathbb{R}^r\to \mathbb{R}^r$ is given by $\pi _2(x,y):=y$ . Below is a sketch of my proof: Let $i\in I$ be any element. Let $(V_i,\psi _i)$ be $m$ -chart of $(M,\mathfrak{A})$ such that $V_i\subseteq U_i$ . Define $\psi _i\times \text{id}_r:V_i\times\mathbb{R}^r\to \psi [V_i]\times \mathbb{R}^r$ by $(\psi _i\times \text{id}_r)(x,y)=(\psi _i(x),y)$ . It's easy to show that this map is smooth. We can show that $\varphi_i |_{\pi ^{-1}[V_i]}:\pi ^{-1}[V_i]\to V_i\times \mathbb{R}^r$ is a homeomorphism. Define $\sigma _i:\pi ^{-1}[V_i]\to \psi_i [V_i]\times \mathbb{R}^r$ by $\sigma _i(x):=(\psi _i\times \text{id}_r)\circ \varphi _i(x)$ . We can show that $\big\{(\pi ^{-1}[V_i],\sigma _i)\big\}_{i\in I}$ is a smooth atlas of $E$ (see the hypothesis 2 of the ""Proposition"" above). So there's a smooth maximal atlas $\mathfrak{E}$ such that $(E,\mathfrak{E})$ is a smooth manifold with dimension $m+r$ . We can also show that $\varphi _i:\pi ^{-1}[U_i]\to U_i\times \mathbb{R}^r$ is a smooth map using the manifold $(E,\mathfrak{E})$ . Since $\pi |_{\pi^{-1}[U_i]}=\pi _1\circ \varphi _i$ for all $i\in I$ and $\pi_1$ is smooth, then we can prove that $\pi :E\to M$ is indeed smooth.","Firstly consider the following notations and definitions: Notation: Let be a smooth manifold.

We say that is a local trivialization of with rank if the following propositions are true: is a homeomorphism with respect to the topology in and the product topology of with the standard topology of ; in which is given by ; My question is: How can I prove the proposition below? Proposition: Let be smooth manifold with dimension . Suppose that the following propositions are true: is surjective map in which is any set; There's a collection of local trivializations of with rank such that and for all the map is a smooth map with respect to the obvious product manifold. Then there's is a smooth maximal atlas such that is a smooth manifold with dimension and is a smooth map. What I did: I proved the above proposition. However the length of my proof may hide errors that I'm not being able to notice (so that proposition may even be false). For this reason I would like to know if there is a simpler proof. Also I would like to know if there is a book that contains the proof of the previous proposition. If that proposition is true, then is a vector bundle because we can construct a -vector space structure in for all and such that given by is an isomorphism of vector spaces in which is given by . Below is a sketch of my proof: Let be any element. Let be -chart of such that . Define by . It's easy to show that this map is smooth. We can show that is a homeomorphism. Define by . We can show that is a smooth atlas of (see the hypothesis 2 of the ""Proposition"" above). So there's a smooth maximal atlas such that is a smooth manifold with dimension . We can also show that is a smooth map using the manifold .

41,Issue in my proof that the limit of circles through three points on a curve is the osculating circle,Issue in my proof that the limit of circles through three points on a curve is the osculating circle,,"I'm going through some differential geometry exercises (from Kristopher Tapp's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces ) I worked on a while ago, and realised I missed a detail in Part (2) of the following: Let $\boldsymbol\gamma: I \to \mathbb R^n$ be a unit-speed curve. Let $t_0 \in I$ and $\kappa(t_0) \neq 0$ . For sufficiently small $h > 0$ , prove that the three points $\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 - h), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ , and $\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + h)$ are not collinear, so there is a unique plane $P_h$ containing them and a unique circle $C_h$ containing them. Precisely formulate and prove the following: (1) As $h \to 0$ , $P_h$ converges to the osculating plane (translated to $\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ ). (2) As $h \to 0$ , $C_h$ converges to the osculating circle (translated to $\boldsymbol\epsilon(t_0)$ ). HINT: For (1), use the Taylor approximation formulas from this section. For (2), for fixed $h$ , let $\mathbf p(h)$ denote the center of $C_h$ , and define $$f(s) = \lvert\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + s) - \mathbf p(h)\rvert^2.$$ Since $f(-h) = f(0) = f(h)$ , the mean value theorem says that there exist $\delta_1 \in (-h, 0)$ and $\delta_2 \in (0, h)$ with $f'(\delta_1) = f'(\delta_2) = 0$ , and then that there exists $\epsilon \in (\delta_1, \delta_2)$ with $f''(\epsilon) = 0$ , which becomes \begin{align} 0 = f'(\delta_i)  &= 2 \langle\boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0 + \delta_i), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + \delta_i) - \mathbf p(h)\rangle \textit{ (for $i \in \{1, 2\}$),}\\ 0 = f''(\epsilon) &= 2 \langle\boldsymbol\gamma''(t_0 + \epsilon), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + \epsilon) - \mathbf p(h)\rangle + 2 \lvert\boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0 + \epsilon)\rvert^2. \end{align} Now consider the limit as $h \to 0$ . In the exercise, $\kappa$ is the curvature function and $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ the center of the osculating circle. Further, the text treats all curves as smooth. I interpreted the statement as saying that (in addition to the statement in Part (1)) $\lim_{h \to 0^+}\mathbf p(h) = \boldsymbol\epsilon(t_0)$ . What I actually showed, however, was that if $\lim_{h \to 0^+}\mathbf p(h) = \mathbf L$ , then $\mathbf L = \boldsymbol\epsilon(t_0)$ : We define $$f(s) = \lvert\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + s) - \mathbf p(h)\rvert^2.$$ Since $f$ is smooth and $f(-h) = f(0) = f(h)$ , the mean value theorem says that there exist $\delta_1 \in (-h, 0)$ and $\delta_2 \in (0, h)$ with $f'(\delta_1) = f'(\delta_2) = 0$ , and then that there exists $\epsilon \in (\delta_1, \delta_2)$ with $f''(\epsilon) = 0$ , which becomes \begin{align} \langle\boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0 + \delta_i), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + \delta_i) - \mathbf p(h)\rangle &= 0\\ \langle\boldsymbol\gamma''(t_0 + \epsilon), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + \epsilon) - \mathbf p(h)\rangle &= -1. \end{align} Now, as $h \to 0$ , $\delta_i, \epsilon \to 0$ , and so if $\lim_{h \to 0^+}\mathbf p(h) = \mathbf L$ , \begin{align} \langle\boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) - \mathbf L\rangle  &= 0\\ \langle\boldsymbol\gamma''(t_0), \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) - \mathbf L\rangle &= -1. \end{align} This tells us that $\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) \perp \boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0)$ . Further, since $\mathbf p(h)$ lies in $P_h$ , $\mathbf L$ lies in the translated osculating plane, and so $\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ lies in the osculating plane. Thus, $\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) \parallel \boldsymbol\gamma''(t_0)$ . We can then conclude that $\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ points in the direction of $\boldsymbol\gamma''(t_0)$ and that $\lvert\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)\rvert = \frac{1} {\kappa(t_0)}$ , i.e. $\mathbf L - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) = \frac{1} {\kappa(t_0)} \mathfrak n$ (where $\mathfrak n$ is the unit normal vector). Thus $\mathbf L = \boldsymbol\epsilon(t_0)$ . However, this doesn't rule out the possibility that $\mathbf p(h)$ doesn't have a limit as $h \to 0$ . I thought to try and finish the proof I should show that $\mathbf p$ is smooth with bounded derivative, and hence uniformly continuous. In doing so, however, I found $\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ in terms of $\mathbf u_1(h) := \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ and $\mathbf u_2(h) := \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 - h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ , and a direct calculation of the limit seems to suggest that the limit is $\boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ instead. To find $\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)$ , I set $\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) = \alpha(h) \mathbf u_1(h) + \beta(h) \mathbf u_2(h)$ . I then used the condition that $\langle\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + h), \mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + h)\rangle = \langle\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0), \mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)\rangle = \langle\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 - h), \mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 - h)\rangle$ along with the facts that $\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 + h) = (\alpha(h) - 1) \mathbf u_1(h) + \beta(h) \mathbf u_2(h)$ and $\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0 - h) = \alpha(h) \mathbf u_1(h) + (\beta(h) - 1) \mathbf u_2(h)$ to solve for $\alpha(h), \beta(h)$ . As a result, I found $$\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0) = \frac{\lvert\mathbf u_2(h)\rvert^2 \langle\mathbf u_1(h), \mathbf u_1(h) - \mathbf u_2(h)\rangle \mathbf u_1(h) + \lvert\mathbf u_1(h)\rvert^2 \langle\mathbf u_2(h) - \mathbf u_1(h), \mathbf u_2(h)\rangle \mathbf u_2(h)}{2 (\lvert\mathbf u_1(h)\rvert^2 \lvert\mathbf u_2(h)\rvert^2 - \langle\mathbf u_1(h), \mathbf u_2(h)\rangle^2)}.$$ But, since $\lim_{h \to 0^+}\mathbf u_1(h) / h = \boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0)$ and $\lim_{h \to 0^+}\mathbf u_2(h) / h = -\boldsymbol\gamma'(t_0)$ , this should imply that $$\lim_{h \to 0^+}(\mathbf p(h) - \boldsymbol\gamma(t_0)) = \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{\left\lvert\frac{\mathbf u_2(h)}{h}\right\rvert^2 \left\langle\frac{\mathbf u_1(h)}{h}, \mathbf u_1(h) - \mathbf u_2(h)\right\rangle \frac{\mathbf u_1(h)}{h} + \left\lvert\frac{\mathbf u_1(h)}{h}\right\rvert^2 \left\langle\mathbf u_2(h) - \mathbf u_1(h), \frac{\mathbf u_2(h)}{h}\right\rangle \frac{\mathbf u_2(h)}{h}}{2 \left(\left\lvert\frac{\mathbf u_1(h)}{h}\right\rvert^2 \left\lvert\frac{\mathbf u_2(h)}{h}\right\rvert^2 - \left\langle\frac{\mathbf u_1(h)}{h}, \frac{\mathbf u_2(h)}{h}\right\rangle^2\right)} = \mathbf0.$$ Am I going wrong somewhere?","I'm going through some differential geometry exercises (from Kristopher Tapp's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces ) I worked on a while ago, and realised I missed a detail in Part (2) of the following: Let be a unit-speed curve.

61,Genericity of an induced projection map,Genericity of an induced projection map,,"Let $X,Y$ be smooth manifolds, $S'$ a submanifold of $Y$ , and $f:\mathbb{R}\times X\to Y$ a smooth function. Generically, we have that $f$ is transverse to $S'$ , which implies that $S:=f^{-1}(S')$ is a smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}\times X$ . It comes with a projection map, namely the restriction of the projection on $\mathbb{R}$ to $S$ . My question is: Is there a generic property I can also ask $f$ to check in order for this projection to be a Morse function? So far analyzing this first transversality condition, I can describe the tangent space of $S$ , $$T_{(t,x)}S=\left\{(\dot{t},\dot{x})\in \mathbb{R}\times T_xX\,;\,(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})+\dot{t}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t,x)\in T_{f(t,x)}S'\right\},$$ and thus if $(t,x)$ is a critical point of $\pi|_S$ , then every tangent vector of $S$ at $(t,x)$ is sent to $0$ by $d\pi_{(t,x)}$ , which amounts to say that $$T_{(t,x)}S=\left\{(0,\dot{x})\in \mathbb{R}\times T_xX\,;\,(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'\right\}\simeq(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}^{-1}(T_{f(t,x)}S').$$ From this we can say that $f_t$ is not transverse to $S'$ , otherwise we would have a problem of dimension ( $T_{(t,x)}S$ would be 1 dimension less than expected). So by the transversality parametric theorem, I can conclude that the regular values of the projection are generic. But there is nothing about the critical values being non-degenerate, and I can even construct a counter-example where the transversality condition alone does not result in the projection being Morse: take $f:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2$ given by $f(t,x)=(t,x)$ and $S'=g(\mathbb{R})$ with $g(x)=(x^3,x)$ . So I have to add something else, probably a transversality condition involving the 1-jet of $f$ , but I can't find it and every help will be much appreciated. Thanks for reading my question! Edit regarding Ted Shifrin's comment: Taking a metric on $S$ , the fact that $\pi$ is Morse translates as $\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$ is transverse to $0_{TS}$ , or again that for all $(t,x)\in S$ s.t. $d\pi_{(t,x)}=0$ , then $$\nabla\mathrm{grad}\,\pi:T_{(t,x)}S\to T_{(t,x)}S,(0,\dot{x})=\dot{x}\mapsto\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$$ is onto. Since in coordinates, $\nabla_{\dot{x}}\mathrm{grad}\,\pi$ is given by $$\left(\dot{x}^i\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k},$$ this amounts to show that for all $\dot{y}=\dot{y}^k\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$ s.t. $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{y})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ , there exists a $\dot{x}=\dot{x}^i\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}$ s.t. $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{x})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ and $$\dot{x}^i\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)=\dot{y}^k.$$ What bothers me from this writing is that I still can't see what property I could add to $f$ in order to this be verified (it will be as soon as $\det\left(\partial_l\pi(\partial_ig^{lk}+g^{lj}\Gamma_{lj}^k)\right)_{ik}\neq 0$ , but I think that this is equivalent to ask that $\mathrm{Hess}(\pi)_{(t,x)}$ is non-degenerate, which is simply the definition of $\pi$ being a Morse function ; and I don't manage to involve the condition $(d_Xf)_{(t,x)}(\dot{y})\in T_{f(t,x)}S'$ ).

I tried modeling my proof after the dimension reducing inductive argument provided in the proof for the weak embedding theorem, but after searching for an answer to something that had stumped me I found that I had essentially written out the proof of Theorem 5.9 found here . For completeness, this is: First, we use the Whitney's embedding theorem for $\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ to find an embedding of $f:M^{k} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ (here $M^{k}$ is our $k-$ manifold). Now, we define $g:TM^{k} > \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$ where $m > 2k$ such that $g(x,v) = > df_{x}(v)$ . Recall that $\dim TM^{k} = 2k$ . Then, since $m > 2k$ we know that every point in $TM^{k}$ is a critical point of $g$ . By applying Sard's theorem, we can pick up an $a \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ such that $a \not \in g(TM^{k})$ and $a \neq 0$ . Let $\pi$ be the projection of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ onto the orthogonal complement of $a$ , $H_{a}$ . The composition $\pi \circ f: M^{k} \longrightarrow H_{a}$ is an immersion if $d(\pi \circ f)$ is injective. To prove that $d(\pi \circ f)$ [the pdf says $f$ but I assume this is a typo] is injective, suppose for a contradiction that $v \neq 0$ and $v > \in T_{x}M^{k}$ such that $d(\pi \circ f)_{x}(v) = 0.$ Note that since $\pi$ is linear, $d(\pi \circ f)_{x} = \pi \circ df_{x}$ by the chain rule. So $\pi \circ df_{x}(v) = 0$ . The projection of a vector $df_{x}(v)$ onto an orthogonal complement of $a$ is only zero if that vector is a scalar multiple of $a$ . So $df_{x}(v) = ta$ for some $t > \in \mathbb{R}$ . If $t = 0$ , then $df_{x}(v) = 0$ . This however cannot happen, because $0 \not \in g(TM^{k})$ . So $t$ is not equal to zero. Therefore, $g(x,\frac{1}{t}) = a$ or $df_{x}(\frac{1}{t}) = a$ which is a contradiction since our choice of $a$ prohibits it from being part of the image of $g$ . So $d(\pi \circ f)$ is injective. Note that $\pi \circ f$ creates an immersion into the $m-1$ dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ . This process can be continued by induction on $m$ until $m = 2k$ , so by repeating this process we will have found an immersion of $M^{k}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{2k}$ . My problem, specifically, is with the part: If $t = 0$ , then $df_{x}(v) = 0$ . This however cannot happen, because $0 \not \in g(TM^{k})$ . Why can't this happen? To my understanding, we've only chosen for certain $a \not \in g(TM^{k})$ , and even further so, shouldn't $0$ be in the image since the derivative is a linear map? I believe a patch to this is that we are taking $f$ to be an embedding, so its derivative is injective and thus its kernel is trivial, but wouldn't using this break the inductive argument at the end?

The question is pretty much: Using the Klein-Gordon equation in the form: $$\partial_{A'_{1}A}\phi^{A_{1}...A_{n}} = \frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}}$$ and $$\partial^{A'_{1}A_{1}}\alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}} = -\frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\phi^{A_{1}...A_{n}}$$ for n = 2s, $\alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}}$ represents an auxiliary variable. Take s = $\frac{1}{2}$ and the pair of spinors $(\phi^{A},\alpha_{A'}) $ taking the components to be $\psi^{0},\psi^{1},\psi^{2},\psi^{3}$ respectively, show this boils down to the Dirac Equation shown in most textbooks. It gives in the question that you should choose the spinor basis $(o^{A},i^{A})$ so that $o_{A}i^{A}=1$ , which to me says that use the basis elements associated with $(o^{A},i^{A})$ are $(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}I,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{x},\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{y},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{z})$ . ( $I$ is the 2x2 identity, and $\sigma^{i}$ are Pauli matrices.) My approach is to set up the spacetime so that the basis vectors have the y component reversed, hence we have all the Pauli matrices of the same sign when we use that 'conversion' tensor $\sigma^{a}_{AA'}$ and then simply substituting into the equations (and putting into bases), I have something along the lines of $$I_{\Lambda\Lambda'}\partial_{t}\phi^{\Lambda} - \sigma^{a}_{\Lambda\Lambda'}\partial_{a}\phi^{\Lambda} - m\alpha_{\Lambda'} = 0$$ and $$I_{\Lambda}^{\Lambda'}\partial_{t}\alpha_{\Lambda'} - \sigma^{a\Lambda'}_{\Lambda}\partial_{a}\alpha_{\Lambda'} + m\phi_{\Lambda} = 0$$ You can use $\epsilon_{\Sigma\Omega}$ to raise and lower the indices as you want to get the component form and a = {x,y,z}. My logic was to effectively 'squish' the two equations together so that we can have a complex vector for $\psi^{\mu}$ as the components of $(\phi^{A},\alpha_{A'})$ and also some 4x4 matrix that represents the operators acting on components of $\psi$ . (In this, I've taken $\phi^{\Lambda} = (\psi^{0},\psi^{1})$ and $\sigma_{\Lambda'} = (\array{\psi^{2}\\\psi^{3}})$ ) But when I write out in components, it doesn't seem to match up to any form of the Dirac equation. This problem would be rectified if the t derivatives were acting on $\alpha$ instead of $\phi$ . I'm yet to study relativistic quantum mechanics so I don't actually know the Dirac equation at all. Clearly these equations are reminiscent of the Dirac equation but they also not exactly the same. I feel that my conversion to a basis is wrong and hence why the time derivatives are acting on the wrong elements of $\psi^{\mu}$ .

My logic was to effectively 'squish' the two equations together so that we can have a complex vector for as the components of and also some 4x4 matrix that represents the operators acting on components of . (In this, I've taken and ) But when I write out in components, it doesn't seem to match up to any form of the Dirac equation. This problem would be rectified if the t derivatives were acting on instead of . I'm yet to study relativistic quantum mechanics so I don't actually know the Dirac equation at all. Clearly these equations are reminiscent of the Dirac equation but they also not exactly the same. I feel that my conversion to a basis is wrong and hence why the time derivatives are acting on the wrong elements of . I do apologise for my tensor notation though, I'm very inexperienced with LaTex and using Stack Exchange.","\partial_{A'_{1}A}\phi^{A_{1}...A_{n}} = \frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}} \partial^{A'_{1}A_{1}}\alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}} = -\frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\phi^{A_{1}...A_{n}} \alpha_{A'_{1}}^{A_{2}...A_{n}} \frac{1}{2} (\phi^{A},\alpha_{A'})  \psi^{0},\psi^{1},\psi^{2},\psi^{3} (o^{A},i^{A}) o_{A}i^{A}=1 (o^{A},i^{A}) (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}I,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{x},\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{y},\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\sigma_{z}) I \sigma^{i} \sigma^{a}_{AA'} I_{\Lambda\Lambda'}\partial_{t}\phi^{\Lambda} - \sigma^{a}_{\Lambda\Lambda'}\partial_{a}\phi^{\Lambda} - m\alpha_{\Lambda'} = 0 I_{\Lambda}^{\Lambda'}\partial_{t}\alpha_{\Lambda'} - \sigma^{a\Lambda'}_{\Lambda}\partial_{a}\alpha_{\Lambda'} + m\phi_{\Lambda} = 0 \epsilon_{\Sigma\Omega} \psi^{\mu} (\phi^{A},\alpha_{A'}) \psi \phi^{\Lambda} = (\psi^{0},\psi^{1}) \sigma_{\Lambda'} = (\array{\psi^{2}\\\psi^{3}}) \alpha \phi \psi^{\mu}","['differential-geometry', 'quantum-mechanics', 'spin-geometry', 'special-relativity']"

And whatever we come up with, we need to assume that is continuously differentiable on the set it is defined and the derivative must be integrable as well. If we consider only the single fixed , I've read that it's sufficient to assume for some tubular neighborhood of . How can we show that?

Not required for this question... 2020/07/24 - changes at end I have a vector, it contains 3 curvatures. A curvature is a change in angle over time, it is either an unit circle/sphere arc-length or angle. because this is purely about curvature, 'axis' will often be referred to as 'axle', since each component represents the curvature of the perpendicular plane around the axle. The sum of the absolute value of the 3 components is the total curvature. (divided by 2 somewhere) For a specific ( X , Y , Z ) vector there is a specific orientation; this can be demonstrated using the Show Basis Map or Show Inverse Basis Map options. $$\begin{matrix}theta= (|X|+|Y|+|Z|)/2 * d_T\\ q_r = cos(theta)\\ q_i = sin(theta) * X / \sqrt(XX+YY+ZZ)\\ q_j = sin(theta) * Y / \sqrt(XX+YY+ZZ)\\  q_k = sin(theta) * Z / \sqrt(XX+YY+ZZ)\end{matrix}$$ \begin{bmatrix}1-2q_{j}^{2}-2q_{k}^{2}&2(q_{i}q_{j}-q_{k}q_{r})&2(q_{i}q_{k}+q_{j}q_{r})\\2(q_{i}q_{j}+q_{k}q_{r})&1-2q_{i}^{2}-2q_{k}^{2}&2(q_{j}q_{k}-q_{i}q_{r})\\2(q_{i}q_{k}-q_{j}q_{r})&2(q_{j}q_{k}+q_{i}q_{r})&1-2q_{i}^{2}-2q_{j}^{2}\end{bmatrix} $$ up = 2(q_iq_j-q_kq_r, 1/2-q_i^2-q_k^2, q_jq_k+q_iq_r) $$ For a specific ( $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ ) vector there is a curve of related ( $X_n$ , $Y_n$ , $Z_n$ ) curvatures that share the same normal.  This demonstration is just showing the curve of rotation vectors that share the same normal as some specified input (controlled by the X , T , and Z sliders; T is the y rotation... the existing Y slider controls the target rotation; which is the destination point around the curve) The curve is formed by linear interpolation from the intersection points where the unit circle centered at the origin, and the normal of the curve of rotations that share the same normal(up/green) : $((X,Y,Z)/\sqrt(XX+YY+ZZ)) Ã up(d_T=1/2)$ .

This curve is created with the normal of the rotation... $acos(Rotation_t Â· Rotation_{t-1} )$ as $t$ steps around the curve. Question - what are the functions that generate (A) and (B); right now all I have is a plot, and all the numbers that went into generating those points on the curve. Reason for the question; Given any arbitrary axis of rotation, these functions will generate the angle-angle-angle updates without translating to a matrix and making assumptions about the reverse translation.

85,Curvature of connection in tautological line bundle,Curvature of connection in tautological line bundle,,"I'm trying to find the mistake in the following computation: let $V$ be a (complex) vector space equipped with a hermitian inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ , ${\rm P}V$ be the projective space of $V$ and $\mathcal{L} \to {\rm P}V$ be the tautological line bundle. As $\mathcal{L}$ is a subbundle of ${\rm P}V \times V$ , it inherits a fiber metric via $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ and so we may project the standard flat connection ${\rm D}$ on the trivial bundle to a connection $\nabla$ on $\mathcal{L}$ . Now, sections of $\mathcal{L}$ correspond to homogeneous functions $\mu\colon V\setminus \{0\} \to \Bbb C$ of degree $-1$ via passing $x \mapsto \mu(x)x$ to the quotient. If $X \in \mathfrak{X}({\rm P}V)$ , then the derivative of this map is $$({\rm D}_X\mu)_x = {\rm d}\mu_x(Xx)x+\mu(x)Xx,$$ so since $Xx \in (\Bbb Cx)^\perp$ (since $T_{{\Bbb C}x}({\rm P}V) \cong {\rm Hom}(\Bbb C x, (\Bbb C x)^\perp)$ ), we obtain $(\nabla_X\mu)_x = {\rm d}\mu_x(Xx)$ . And $x\mapsto {\rm d}\mu_x(Xx)$ is also homogeneous of degree $-1$ .

96,Is every diffeomorphism conformally equivalent to a volume preserving diffeomorphism?,Is every diffeomorphism conformally equivalent to a volume preserving diffeomorphism?,,"Let $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be the closed unit disk. Let $f:D \to D$ be a diffeomorphism. Does there exist a smooth $h \in C^{\infty}(D)$ such that $h\cdot f$ is an area-preserving diffeomorphism of $D$ ? Clearly, such an $h$ must send the entire boundary $\partial D$ either to $1$ or to $-1$ . Another necessary condition is $\det\big(d (h\cdot f)\big) = 1$ . Since $$ d (h\cdot f)=h df+dh \otimes f=h df+f \cdot (\nabla h)^T, $$ by the matrix determinant lemma , at all points where $h \neq 0$ , we have $$ \det\big(d (h\cdot f)\big)=h^2\det(df) \big( 1+h^{-1}(\nabla h)^T ((df)^{-1} \cdot f)\big), $$ so we need to solve the following PDE for $h$ $$\det(df) \cdot \big( h^2+h(\nabla h)^T ((df)^{-1} \cdot f)\big)=1.$$","Let be the closed unit disk.

97,Focal points to geodesic submanifolds defined by tangent vectors,Focal points to geodesic submanifolds defined by tangent vectors,,"The following definitions are from Comparison Theorems in Riemannian Geometry by Cheeger & Ebin. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. The geodesic submanifold defined by a tangent vector $v\in T_pM$ is $\exp_p(B)$ where $B\ni0$ is a small ball in $\operatorname{span}(v)^\perp\subset T_pM$ , so small that $\exp_p|_B$ is an embedding. Let $\gamma(t):=\exp_p(tv)$ . We consider points focal to the geodesic submanifold defined by $v$ along the geodesic $\gamma$ . In the book there is a Rauch II, i.e., second Rauch comparison, which requires the geodesic to have no focal points in the above sense. Question. Let $c:[0,\ell]\to M$ be a geodesic and $E$ a parallel field along $c$ orthogonal to $c'$ . Does there exist an $\varepsilon>0$ such that for all $t\in[0,\ell]$ , the there are no points on the geodesic $$\gamma_t:[0,\varepsilon]\to M,s\mapsto\exp_{c(t)}(sE(t))$$ that is focal to the geodesic submanifold defined by $E(t)$ along $\gamma_t$ ? This seems to be implicitly assumed in the proof of a lemma for the CheegerâGromoll soul theorem. However, I don't see why this is true. The existence of such a focal point is equivalent to having a critical point of some restriction of $\exp$ , but for each $t$ the restrictions are different and don't seem to be related. So I don't know how to make the $\varepsilon$ uniform with respect to $t$ . Any help is deeply appreciated! Edit: It seems that the notion of focal points is not so well-known. Here it is in the sense as in, e.g., Morse Theory by Milnor. Let $N$ be a submanifold, $\gamma$ a unit-speed geodesic with $\gamma(0)\in N$ , $\gamma'(0)\perp T_{\gamma(0)}N$ . Let $T^\perp N\subset TM$ be the normal bundle of $N$ . A point $\gamma(a)$ is said to be focal to $N$ along $\gamma$ if $\exp_p|_{T^\perp N}:T^\perp N\to M$ is singular at $a\gamma'(0)$ (note that $\exp(a\gamma'(0))=\gamma(a)$ ). In particular, when $N$ is a single point this reduces to the usual notion of conjugate points along a geodesic.","The following definitions are from Comparison Theorems in Riemannian Geometry by Cheeger & Ebin.
