The key to the problem would be to show that a and b must both have and odd power of 3 in their prime factorization. The outline of my proof for the above specific case is as follows: Note that $a,b$ cannot both be perfect squares. We write $a=3^{k_1}\alpha, b=3^{k_2}\beta$, where $3∤α,β$ By considering congruences, prove that $k_1, k_2$ must be of the same parity. Considering the case where $k_1, k_2$ are both even $\alpha,\beta$ cannot both be perfect squares. By squaring both sides of the original equation, we find that $\sqrt{\alpha\beta}$ must be rational, and thus it must be an integer too. Expressing ${\alpha, \beta}$ as products of perfect squares and square free integers, we find that their square free components must be equal. Denote this square free component as $f$. $12\sqrt{3}=C\sqrt{f}$, where $C$ is an integer. Then $f=3$, which is a contradiction.

The key to the problem would be to show that a and b must both have and odd power of 3 in their prime factorization. The outline of my proof for the above specific case is as follows: Note that $a,b$ cannot both be perfect squares. We write $a=3^{k_1}\alpha, b=3^{k_2}\beta$, where $3∤α,β$ By considering congruences, prove that $k_1, k_2$ must be of the same parity. Considering the case where $k_1, k_2$ are both even $\alpha,\beta$ cannot both be perfect squares. By squaring both sides of the original equation, we find that $\sqrt{\alpha\beta}$ must be rational, and thus it must be an integer too. Expressing ${\alpha, \beta}$ as products of perfect squares and square free integers, we find that their square free components must be equal. Denote this square free component as $f$. $12\sqrt{3}=C\sqrt{f}$, where $C$ is an integer. Then $f=3$, which is a contradiction.

Step 1: We start with the Euler product formula which we derive elsewhere [ref] . $$\sum_{n}\frac{1}{n^{s}}=\prod_{p}(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})^{-1}$$ We take the logarithms of both sides. Step 2: On the RHS we have: $$\begin{align} \ln\left(\prod_{p}\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})}\right) &= \sum_{p}\ln\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})}\\ &=-\sum_{p}\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})\end{align}$$ We can use $\ln(1-x)=-x-\frac{x^{2}}{2}-\frac{x^{3}}{3}-\ldots$ to expand $\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^s})$ . $$\begin{align} -\sum_{p}\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})&=\sum_{p}(\frac{1}{p^{s}}+\frac{1}{2p^{2s}}+\frac{1}{3p^{3s}}+\frac{1}{4p^{4s}}\ldots)\\&=\sum_{p}\frac{1}{p^{s}}+C \end{align}$$ We know $C$ converges because we know $\sum1/n^s$ converges for $s>1$ , and the sum over primes $\sum 1/p^s$ is a subset of the sum over integers $\sum 1/n^s$ . Step 3: We start with the logarithm of the partial harmonic series. $$ \ln(\ln(n+1)) < \ln\left(\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{x}\right) < \ln(\ln(n)+1) $$ The inequality is from the integral comparison tests for finite harmonic partial sums ( ref ). The lower and upper bounds are like $\ln(\ln(n))$ The sum $\ln\left(\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{x}\right)$ is the LHS of the Euler product in the limit as $n\rightarrow \infty$ , and $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ for the Euler product.

We consider the limit $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ for the expression from step 2: $$\sum_{p}\frac{1}{p}+C$$ Similarly we consider the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ for the expression in step 3 and conclude that the logarithm of the harmonic series diverges but it does so as $\ln(\ln(n))$ . Therefore we can say the prime harmonic series diverges as $$\sum_{p<n} 1/p \sim \ln(\ln(n))$$ The key idea I think I'm using is to enable comparison of two expressions by taking the limits $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ to make them equivalent.

66,How many ways can a number $n>2$ be expressed as the difference of two squares?,How many ways can a number  be expressed as the difference of two squares?,n>2,"I provide my answer to the title question, which I pursue purely out of my own curiosity. My question to the community is: Have I thought this through correctly, or have I made one or more mistakes? It is identically true algebraically, $$\Bigl(\frac{\frac{n}{t}+t}{2}\Bigr)^2-\Bigl(\frac{\frac{n}{t}-t}{2}\Bigr)^2=n$$ when $t\mid n$ and the following conditions hold: $\frac{n}{t}>t$ and $\frac{n}{t}\equiv t\mod{2}$ . The first condition is necessary to ensure that both LHS terms inside the brackets will be positive, and the second condition is necessary to ensure that each LHS numerator is even, so that each LHS fraction is an integer. My first conclusion is: The number of ways to express $n$ as the difference of two squares will simply be equal to the number of examples of $t$ that meet the stated conditions. Let $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\cdots p_m^{a_m}$ . Then for any factor $t$ of $n$ , $t=p_1^{b_1}p_2^{b_2}\cdots p_m^{b_m}$ where $0\le b_i\le a_1$ (with the stipulation that $a_i>0$ ). Each prime factor $p_i$ may appear from $0$ to $(a_i)$ times in various $t$ , giving $(a_i+1)$ choices, so the total number of factors $\tau(n)=(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\cdots(a_m+1)$ . But not all factors will meet the required conditions. I note that a question has been posed and answered here about a very limited instance of my question, where every $p_i$ is odd and every $a_i=1$ . The first condition, $\frac{n}{t}>t$ , requires that $t$ be strictly smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ . This is in general easy to accommodate because for every factor $t<\sqrt{n}$ there is a corresponding factor $\frac{n}{t}>\sqrt{n}$ . So the number of factors smaller than $\sqrt{n}$ is just $\frac{\tau(n)}{2}$ with one caveat. If $n$ happens to be a perfect square, then there will be one factor $t=\frac{n}{t}=\sqrt{n}$ , in which case the number of factors would be $\frac{\tau(n)-1}{2}$ . This ambiguity can be addressed using the floor function: the number of factors that comply with the first requirement can be expressed as $\lfloor \frac{\tau(n)}{2}\rfloor$ . Next, accommodation must be made for the second requirement $\frac{n}{t}\equiv t\mod{2}$ . In effect, this means that if $n$ contains factors of $2$ within it, they may not all be included in, or omitted from, $t$ . If $n=2^xq$ where $q$ is odd, then with respect to the exponent of $2$ we must have $1\le b\le (x-1)$ . There are two fewer options (i.e. $0$ and $x$ ) to choose from. So if $n$ is even, we must multiply our previous result (i.e. $\lfloor \frac{\tau(n)}{2}\rfloor$ ) by $\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ to replace the incorrect multiplier $(x+1)$ with the correct value $(x-1)$ . Note that if $2$ is present in $n$ only once, the correction factor $\frac{x-1}{x+1}=0$ . This correctly shows that any number which is twice an odd number (including the number $2$ itself) cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. This fact is independently known because $2(2j+1)=4j+2\equiv 2 \mod{4}$ which cannot be the difference of two squares. I conclude that the number of ways that a number $n>2$ can be expressed as the difference of two squares is $\lfloor \frac{\tau(n)}{2}\rfloor$ if $n$ is odd, and $\lfloor \frac{x-1}{x+1} \cdot \frac{\tau(n)}{2}\rfloor$ in $n$ is even, where $x$ is the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $n$ .","I provide my answer to the title question, which I pursue purely out of my own curiosity.

Find the common divisors of $a_{1986}$ and $a_{6891}$. I think it is true that $\gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_{\gcd(m,n)}$, but I am not sure how to prove it. From this the answer follows since $\gcd(1986,6891) = 3$ and so $\gcd(a_{1986,6891}) = a_3 = 17$.","Let $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be the sequence of integers defined recursively by $a_0 = 0$, $a_1 = 1, a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1}+a_{n}$ for $n \geq 0$.

97,Sequences avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions,Sequences avoiding three-term arithmetic progressions,,"A conjecture by Erdos states that if a sequence $(a_n)$ of natural numbers is ""big"" in the sense that $$\sum_{n\in \Bbb{N}}\frac{1}{a_n} = \infty$$ then $(a_n)$ contains arithmetric progressions of arbitrarily large lengths. Contrapositively, this is to say that for all $k\in \Bbb{N}$, if $(a_n)$ avoids any arithmetic progressions of length $k$, then its sum of reciprocals is finite. This conjecture is unsolved even for $k = 3$. If one wanted to create a sequence that ""maximizes"" its sum of reciprocals while avoiding APs of length $3$, one naive approach would be to start the sequence with $1$, then have each subsequent term be the smallest number that does not create an AP of length three with the previous terms. This sequence is OEIS 3278 . My questions are as follows: are there any sequences (that we know of) which avoid APs of length three while having a larger sum of reciprocals than OEIS 3278? And do we know of any such sequence which grows more slowly (asymptotically speaking) than OEIS 3278?

For example with $ K = \mathbb{Q}(\theta) $, where $ \theta $ is a root of $ 2 + 7x + 2x^2 + 8x^3 $, we get that $ h_K = 2 $ and $ h_{\overline{K}} = 88 $.  Somehow a factor of 11 suddenly appears.
