I have to find if the function is injective, surjective and if bijective find the inverse function $$f : \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N},\qquad f(a) =       \begin{cases}        2a  & \text{if } a >0, \\        1 - 2a & \text{if } a \le 0. \\      \end{cases}$$ The solution to the problem: Injectivity: $f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b$ . Taking a $x_{1}$ , $x_{2} \in \mathbb{Z}$ , I separate into the following cases: 1) $x_ {1} > 0$ , $x_{2} > 0:\; 2x_{1} = 2x_{2} \Rightarrow x_{1} = x_{2}$ 2) $x_ {1} \le 0$ , $x_{2} \le 0:\; 1-2x_{1} = 1-2x_{2} \Rightarrow x_{1} = x_{2}$ 3) $x_{1} > 0, x_{2} \le 0:\;2x_{1} = 1-2x_{2} \Rightarrow 2x_{1} + 2x_{2} = 1 \Rightarrow (x_{1} + x_{2}) = 1/2$ The case $x_{2} > 0$ , $x_{1} \le 0$ , gives the same answer as the third case.

14,Partial fractions for any function?,Partial fractions for any function?,,"I recently discovered a property of polynomials that have all roots distinct. That is, if $a_i \neq a_j$ for $i \neq j$ , and if $$f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (x-a_i)$$ Then, $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac {f(x)}{(x-a_i)f'(a_i)} = 1$$ Which can be proved by noting that the LHS is an $n-1$ degree polynomial and if it equals the RHS for $n$ distinct $x$ , it must be true always. But it's obviously true for the $n$ roots of $f(x)$ (in the limit as $x$ tends to $a_i$ ) This was useful because if I had the reciprocal of such a polynomial, I could easily break it into partial fractions like: $$\boxed{\frac {1}{f(x)} = \frac{1/ f'(a_1)}{x-a_1} +\frac{1/f'(a_2)}{x-a_2} + ... + \frac{1/f'(a_n)}{x-a_n}}$$ Now, my question is: Is this property satisfied by ANY function (apart from polynomials) that doesn't have repeated roots? (Continuous, differentiable) For example, consider $f(x) = \tan x$ Then, $f(x)$ has roots at $x=k \pi$ for every integer $k$ And it doesn't have repeated roots, i.e., if $f(t)=0$ then $f'(t) \neq 0$ So, if we want to verify the equation in the box, it would be: $$\cot x = \sum_{n= -\infty}^{\infty} \frac {1}{x-n \pi}$$ Which is correct because it is the same as the well known $$\pi \cot \pi x - \frac {1}{x} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {2x}{x^2 - n^2}$$ So, would ANY continuous, differentiable function with no repeated roots satisfy this?
