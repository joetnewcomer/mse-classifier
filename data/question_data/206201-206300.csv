I think that the 'correct' answer misrepresents the statement in the case where $A(x)$ is true, $B(x)$ is false, and $H(x)$ is false. This results in F -> T, which makes the conditional true.

The question is as follows: How many length-6 lists can be made from the symbols $\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G\}$ if repetition is allowed and the list is in alphabetical order? (Ex. BBCEGG, but not BBBAGG). My Solution Since we want this to be in alphabetical order we need to think of what the starting letter is. If the starting letter is $A$ then we are free to choose $A$ as many times after that. If we choose $B$ to be our first letter than we can never choose $A$ in that list. Using ""stars and bars,"" let's say we choose $A$ to be our first letter, then we have $5$ more spots to from our selection of symbols. Thus, we have $5$ stars and $6$ bars, $\binom{11}{5}$ . Using the same idea for choosing $B$ being the first letter, we have $5$ more spots to fill in, but we cannot choose $A$ . This leads to the consequence of loosing a bar. So, we have $5$ stars and now $5$ bars leading to $\binom{10}{5}$ Continuing with this choosing the first letter from $A$ to $G$ we get: $$\binom{11}{5} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{9}{5} + \binom{8}{5} + \binom{7}{5} + \binom{6}{5} + \binom{5}{5} = 924$$ Authors Solution: Any such list corresponds to a 6-element multiset made from the symbols $\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G \}$ .

My question is, in general, what is the number $a$ , in terms of $n$ and $k$ , such that given any random tiling of the grid, it can be restored to symmetry in no more than $a$ moves.

Source: Brilliant,Each of four people wear a hat with a distinct positive integer $<28$. Everyone can see everyone’s number except his own. At 12:00 pm everyone can say something: either “Red” or “Yellow” or nothing. After 12:00 everyone must know his own number. How can they achieve this? Source: Brilliant,,['discrete-mathematics']
94,Generating function of a sequence with a sum,Generating function of a sequence with a sum,,"I am new to generating functions and I know some of the basics how to create them. But now I am not sure how to create a generating function of this sequence: $$a_0 = 0$$ $$ a_n = n + c (\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k)$$ for n >=1 where c is a real non-zero constant. I guess I need to add $ \frac {1}{(1-x)^2}$ (which is generating function of the n (sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)) to the rest. But how do I evaluate the rest? Thank you for any tips.","I am new to generating functions and I know some of the basics how to create them.

95,Is every subset of a lattice a lattice?,Is every subset of a lattice a lattice?,,"Is every subset of a lattice a lattice? Lattice consists of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have to have unique supremum and infimum. I'm confused about what the answer is. I considered a lattice $(L, \le)$ where $L$ is a set {1, 2, 3, 6} and $\le$ is relation of divisibility (a simplified version of this example ) (e.g. 1 divides 2, 3 and 6, 2 divides 6, etc.). Now if I take $\{1, 2, 3\}$ as a subset of this lattice, would this still be a lattice? Would $2$ and $3$ be missing a supremum? On one hand I think they would because $6$ is no longer in the set but on the other hand isn't supremum not required to be in the set in question? For example the set of real numbers on an open interval $(0, 1)$ has a supremum equal to 1, even though 1 is not in the set.","Is every subset of a lattice a lattice?

But this isn't very beneficial since I don't know the logic behind converting the summation to a closed form.
