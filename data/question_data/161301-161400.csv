Here would be my (incomplete) proof : We start by using the given hint and write $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\int_\Omega |f|^{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu}{\int_\Omega |f|^n\,\mathrm{d}\mu} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\|f\|_\infty \int_\Omega {\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)}^{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu}{\int_\Omega {\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)}^n\,\mathrm{d}\mu} = \|f\|_\infty \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\int_\Omega {\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)}^{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu}{\int_\Omega {\left(\frac{|f|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)}^n\,\mathrm{d}\mu} =: \star\\$$ Now, we want to use the dominated convergence theorem. For this, we define for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ the function $f_n:\Omega\to [-\infty,+\infty]$ by $$ f_n(x) = \left(\frac{|f(x)|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)^n.$$ We know that $[|f|>\|f\|_\infty]$ is a $\mu$ -null set. For $x\in\Omega\setminus[|f|>\|f\|_\infty]$ we have $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\frac{|f(x)|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)^n = \begin{cases}    0 &\mbox{if}\;\; |f(x)|<\|f\|_\infty, \\    1 &\mbox{if}\;\; |f(x)|=\|f\|_\infty. \end{cases} $$ Thus, $f_n \xrightarrow{n\to\infty} \mathbf{1}_{[|f|=\|f\|_\infty]}$ pointwise $\mu$ -almost everywhere. Since $f$ is measurable, we have for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ that $f_n$ is measurable, too. Indicator functions are measurable and therefore $\mathbf{1}_{[|f|=\|f\|_\infty]}$ is measurable. For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $x\in\Omega\setminus[|f|>\|f\|_\infty]$ , we see that $$ |f_n(x)| = f_n(x) = \left(\frac{|f(x)|}{\|f\|_\infty}\right)^n \le \frac{|f(x)|}{\|f\|_\infty} \le 1 = |\mathbf{1}_\Omega(x)|.$$ And since $\mu(\Omega)<+\infty$ , we get $\int_\Omega |\mathbf{1}_\Omega|\,\mathrm{d}\mu = \mu(\Omega) < +\infty$ and hence, $\mathbf{1}_\Omega$ is an integrable function which dominates all $f_n$ on the complement of a $\mu$ -null set. One can simply show that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_{n+1}(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)\quad\forall x\in\Omega\setminus[|f|>\|f\|_\infty]$ . Now, we are ready to use the dominated convergence theorem (applied on the sequences $(f_{n+1})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ ) and we get $$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_\Omega f_{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_\Omega f_n\,\mathrm{d}\mu = \int_\Omega \mathbf{1}_{[|f|=\|f\|_\infty]}\,\mathrm{d}\mu = \mu([|f|=\|f\|_\infty]) \le \mu(\Omega) < +\infty.\\ $$ Thus, the sequences $(\int_\Omega f_{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and $(\int_\Omega f_n\,\mathrm{d}\mu)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converge both to $\mu([|f|=\|f\|_\infty])\in\mathbb{R}$ , so we are allowed to use the quotient rule for limits and therefore $$    \star = \|f\|_\infty \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\int_\Omega f_{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu}{\int_\Omega f_n\,\mathrm{d}\mu} = \|f\|_\infty \frac{\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\Omega f_{n+1}\,\mathrm{d}\mu}{\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\Omega f_n\,\mathrm{d}\mu} = \|f\|_\infty \frac{\mu([|f|=\|f\|_\infty])}{\mu([|f|=\|f\|_\infty])} = \|f\|_\infty.\\ $$ My question would be: What if $\mu([|f|=\|f\|_\infty])=0$ ?

31,Lusin’s Theorem for Polish spaces with infinite Radon measure,Lusin’s Theorem for Polish spaces with infinite Radon measure,,"I’m working on the following exercise in Klenke’s Probability Theory: A Comprehensive Course (Exercise 13.1.3), which asks us to prove the following generalization of Lusin’s Theorem: Let $\Omega$ be a Polish space, let $\mu$ be a $\sigma$ -finite measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal B(\Omega))$ , and let $f : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ be a map. Show that the following are equivalent: There is a Borel measurable map $g : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ with $f = g$ almost everywhere. For any $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a compact set $K_\epsilon$ with $\mu(\Omega \setminus K_\epsilon) < \epsilon$ such that the restricted function $f|_{K_\epsilon}$ is continuous. As stated, this exercise is wrong when $\mu(\Omega) = \infty$ : if $\Omega = \mathbb R$ , no compact set has a complement with finite Lebesgue measure, so it should be a closed set $K_\epsilon$ . Furthermore, $\mu$ must be more than just $\sigma$ -finite. Let $\Omega = \mathbb R$ , and $\mu = \sum_{q \in \mathbb Q} \delta_q$ be the counting measure of the rationals. Then $\mu$ is certainly $\sigma$ -finite, but if $f$ is a Borel-measurable map and if $K \subset \mathbb R$ is closed with $\mu(K^c) < \epsilon$ for $\epsilon < 1$ , then we must have $\mu(K^c) = 0$ , or $K \supset \mathbb Q$ . But then since $K$ is closed, $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}= \mathbb R \subset K$ , so $f$ must be continuous on $\mathbb R$ in order for the claim to hold. So we need more than $\sigma$ -finite. One way to edit the exercise is to instead assume $\mu$ is Radon and modify Statement 2 like so: There is a Borel measurable map $ g : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ with $f = g$ $\mu$ -a.e. For any subset $A \subset \Omega$ with $\mu(A) < \infty$ , and for any $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a compact $K_\epsilon \subset A$ such that $f|_{K_\epsilon}$ is continuous. These statements may be shown to be equivalent, since one can show Radon measures on Polish are $\sigma$ -finite (see the discussion below). But suppose we want to show the “original” Statement 2: For any $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a closed $K_\epsilon \subset \Omega$ with $\mu(K_\epsilon^c) < \epsilon$ such that the restricted function $f|_{K_\epsilon} : K_\epsilon \to \mathbb R$ is continuous.

Then I think $f:=\begin{cases}f_{1} & \text{ on }X_{1}\\f_{2} & \text{ on }X_{2}\end{cases}$ is measurable as a function $f:\Omega\to\Gamma$. The following seems to work, could someone confirm this is correct and that I haven't overlooked anything? Let $A\in \mathcal{C}$, then $f^{-1}(A) = (X_{1}\cap f^{-1}(A))\cup (X_{2}\cap f^{-1}(A)) = \underbrace{f_{1}^{-1}(A)}_{\in \mathcal{B_{1}}}\cup \underbrace{f_{2}^{-1}(A)}_{\in\mathcal{B_{2}}}\in\Sigma.$","I have the following setting: Let $(\Omega,\Sigma)$, $(\Gamma, \mathcal{C})$, $(X_{1},\mathcal{B}_{1})$, and $(X_{2},\mathcal{B}_{2})$ be measurable spaces such that $\Omega = X_{1}\cup X_{2}$, $X_{1}\cap X_{2} = \emptyset$, $\mathcal{B}_{1} = \{X_{1}\cap A:A\in\Sigma)$, $\mathcal{B}_{2} = \{X_{2}\cap A:A\in\Sigma)$. Let $f_{1}:X_{1}\to\Gamma$ and $f_{2}:X_{2}\to\Gamma$ be measurable.
