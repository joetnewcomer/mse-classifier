1,Why do you need tensors of rank $>2$?,Why do you need tensors of rank ?,>2,"Question from someone just starting to study tensors (sorry if it's silly): So I understand (maybe?) that tensors are basically about coordinate transformations (and things that are invariant under said transformations), and that in writing out a tensor, we use notation that represents functions that perform the coordinate transformations. But when I see a tensor of, say, rank 3 or 4 written out, it looks like we're jumping from one coordinate system to another to another, before we arrive from the original coordinate system to the final one. If you're only really starting at one coordinate system, and ending at another, why can't you treat each tensor as just a single coordinate transformation, i.e. a function that takes you directly from the original coordinate system to the final one?","Question from someone just starting to study tensors (sorry if it's silly): So I understand (maybe?) that tensors are basically about coordinate transformations (and things that are invariant under said transformations), and that in writing out a tensor, we use notation that represents functions that perform the coordinate transformations.

The collection of all such $A_{i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}$'s covers $R^{n-1}\times 0$ and the sum of the measures of the $A_{i_1,\dots,i_{n-1}}$'s is less than $\epsilon$. (Why?)",,['analysis']

Suppose that $(f_n)_n \subset L^{\infty}(X)$ is a $w^{*}$ -Cauchy sequence.  Then by identifying $f_n \mapsto \varphi_n$ where: $$\varphi_n(g) = \int_{X} f_ng \: d\mu$$ via the duality $L^1(X)^{*} \cong L^{\infty}(X)$ (since the measure space is $\sigma$ -finite) we then conclude that for each $g \in L^1(X)$ , $|\varphi_n(g) - \varphi_m(g)| \longrightarrow 0$ by definition of being $w^{*}$ -Cauchy.  However then $(\varphi_n(g))_n \subset \mathbb{C}$ converges to a number $\varphi(g) \in \mathbb{C}$ by completeness. Define $\varphi: L^1(X) \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by $\varphi(g) = \lim_n \varphi_n(g)$ .  Obviously $\varphi$ is linear, so if we just prove that $\varphi$ is bounded, then $\varphi \in L^1(X)^{*}$ , so by the duality there exists a map $f \in L^{\infty}(X)$ such that: $$\varphi(g) = \int_{X}fg \: d\mu = \lim_n \varphi_n(g) =\lim_n \int_{X} f_ng \: d\mu \: \: \forall g \in L^1(\mu).$$ In particular then, $f_n \longrightarrow f$ in the $w^{*}$ -topology on $L^{\infty}(X)$ by definition, which will finish the proof. I'm having an issue actually proving that $\varphi$ is bounded however.  I know by the Closed Graph theorem that it suffices to consider a sequence $(g_k,\varphi(g_k)) \longrightarrow (0,\alpha) \in L^1(X) \times \mathbb{C}$ and prove that $\alpha = 0$ .  Doing that, we see: $$|\alpha| = \lim_k |\varphi(g_k)| = \lim_k \lim_n |\varphi_n(g_k)| \leq \lim_k \sup_n \int_{X} |f_ng_k| \: d\mu$$ $$\leq \lim_k \sup_n \lVert f_n \lVert_{\infty} \lVert g_k \rVert_1.$$ Hence it suffices to know that $\sup_n \lVert f_n \rVert < \infty$ , which is equivalent to proving the family of bounded linear maps $M_n: g \mapsto f_ng$ is pointwise bounded by the Uniform Boundedness Principle, however I haven't been able to show that this is true.

Definition. Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and let $\varepsilon>0$ . A subset $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ of $X$ is called an $\varepsilon$ -net of $X$ if every point $x \in X$ can be approximated to within $\varepsilon$ by some point $y \in \mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ , i.e. so that $d(x, y) \leq \varepsilon$ . The minimal cardinality of an $\varepsilon$ -net of $X$ , if finite, is denoted $\mathcal{N}(X, \varepsilon)$ and is called the covering number of $X$ (at scale $\varepsilon)$ . Equivalently, $\mathcal{N}(X, \varepsilon)$ is the minimal number of balls with radii $\varepsilon$ and with centers in $X$ needed to cover $X$ . Suppose we have an $\varepsilon$ -net that covers $X$ in the optimal way , i.e., the number of balls used is $\mathcal{N}(X, \varepsilon)$ . Are these balls always disjoint? I don't think so. The following is the text of the main lemma, concerning covering numbers of the sphere. Lemma $5.2$ (Covering numbers of the sphere). The unit Euclidean sphere $S^{n-1}$ equipped with the Euclidean metric satisfies for every $\varepsilon>0$ that $$ \mathcal{N}\left(S^{n-1}, \varepsilon\right) \leq\left(1+\frac{2}{\varepsilon}\right)^n $$ Proof. This is a simple volume argument. Let us fix $\varepsilon>0$ and choose $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ to be a maximal $\varepsilon$ -separated subset of $S^{n-1}$ . In other words, $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ is such that $d(x, y) \geq \varepsilon$ for all $x, y \in \mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ , $x \neq y$ , and no subset of $S^{n-1}$ containing $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ has this property. One can in fact construct $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ inductively by first selecting an arbitrary point on the sphere, and at each next step selecting a point that is at distance at least ${\varepsilon}$ from those already selected. By compactness, this algorithm will terminate after finitely many steps and it will yield a set $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ as we required. How does compactness imply the algorithm's termination in finitely many steps? The maximality property implies that $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ is an $\varepsilon$ -net of $S^{n-1}$ . Indeed, otherwise there would exist $x \in S^{n-1}$ that is at least $\varepsilon$ -far from all points in $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ . So $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon} \cup\{x\}$ would still be an $\varepsilon$ -separated set, contradicting the maximality property. Moreover, the separation property implies via the triangle inequality that the balls of radii $\varepsilon / 2$ centered at the points in $\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}$ are disjoint. On the other hand, all such balls lie in $(1+\varepsilon / 2) B_2^n$ where $B_2^n$ denotes the unit Euclidean ball centered at the origin. Comparing the volume gives $\operatorname{vol}\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2} B_2^n\right) \cdot\left|\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}\right| \leq \operatorname{vol}\left(\left(1+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right) B_2^n\right)$ . Since $\operatorname{vol}\left(r B_2^n\right)=r^n \operatorname{vol}\left(B_2^n\right)$ for all $r \geq 0$ , we conclude that $\left|\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}\right| \leq\left(1+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^n /\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^n=\left(1+\frac{2}{\varepsilon}\right)^n$ as required. This is probably straightforward, but I want to make sure I have the details correct. The conclusion follows from $\mathcal{N}(X, \varepsilon) \le \left|\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}\right| \leq\left(1+\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^n /\left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^n=\left(1+\frac{2}{\varepsilon}\right)^n$ , right? I ask because $\mathcal{N}(X, \varepsilon) < \left|\mathcal{N}_{\varepsilon}\right|$ is a possibility. Wouldn't the same proof work for $B^n_2$ also? I don't see why anything would change. I believe $\mathcal{N}\left(B^n_2, \varepsilon\right) \leq\left(1+\frac{2}{\varepsilon}\right)^n$ is also correct.

62,Area-preserving,Area-preserving,,"A diffeomorphism $\varphi: S \to \bar{S}$ is said to be area-preserving if the area of any region R \subset S is equal to the area of $\varphi(R)$ . Prove that if $\varphi$ is area-preserving and conformal, then ϕ is an isometry. I have two ideas for this excersise. First, i consider a parametrization $x: U \to R \subset S$ and $\bar{x}:\varphi \circ x : X(U) \to \varphi(X(U)) $ a parametrization for $\bar{S}$ . We can note that if $\varphi$ is area-preserving then $A(R)=A(\varphi(R))$ . Here, i can use the definition of Area with respect to its partial derivatives and then we have that $$A(R)=\int\int_{R}||x_{u} \times x_{v}||dudv$$ But for $\bar{S}$ $$A(\varphi(R))=\int\int ||(\varphi \circ x)_{u} \times (\varphi \circ x)_{v}||dudv$$ here i'm stuck, because i'dont know how to proceed with $A(\varphi(R))$ or how to describe the partial derivatives of the composition or use the hypotesis that $\varphi$ is conformal, i'm sure that conformal does not implies that coeficients of x and $\bar{x}$ are $\lambda$ - times of another, i.e, $\bar{E}=\lambda  E, \bar{F}= \lambda F, \bar{G}= \lambda G$ , so i don't know what to do here. Another idea for this is use the definition of area with respect to first fundamental form but here the only way to develop this idea is using the wrong assumption about coefficients that i was talking about. I appreciate some idea. UPDATE i want to be sure that this attempt is good. I will proof that $$d\varphi_{q}(x_{u})=\bar{x}_{u}$$ where $x_{u}$ and $\bar{x}_{u}$ are the partial derivatives of x and $\bar{x}$ respectively. Now,for $(u_{0},v_{0}) \in U$ and $q=x(u_{0},v_{0}) $ and $\alpha$ a curve defined as $x(u,v_{0})=\alpha(u)$ , therefore $\alpha'(u)=x_{u}(u,v_{0})$ . Now, we have that $$d\varphi_{q}(x_{u}(u_{0},v_{0}))=d\varphi_{q}(\alpha'(u_{0}))=(\varphi \circ \alpha)'(u_{0})$$ then we have that $$d\varphi_{q}(x_{u}(u,v_{0}))=d\varphi_{q}(\alpha'(u))=(\varphi \circ \alpha)'(u)$$ for all $u$ but now, we can note that $$(\varphi \circ \alpha)(u)=\varphi(\alpha(u))=\varphi(x(u,v_{0})=(\varphi \circ x)(u,v_{0})=\bar{x}(u,v_{0})$$ so, finally we have that $$(\varphi \circ \alpha)'(u,v_{0})=\bar{x}_{u}(u,v_{0})$$ and we can conclude that $$(\varphi \circ \alpha)'=d\varphi_{q}(x_{u})=\bar{x}_{u}$$ this is enought or this proof is wrong?","A diffeomorphism is said to be area-preserving if the area of any region R \subset S is equal to the area of .

Define $f: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by \begin{align*} f(x, y):= \frac{x^2 \sin y^2}{x^2+y^4}, & (x, y) \neq(0,0) & \\ f(x,y) := 0, & (x, y)=(0,0) \end{align*} Is the function continuous in (0,0)? Do the partial derivatives $(D_1f)(0,0)$ en $(D_2f)(0,0)$ exist? For which $u \in \mathbb{R}^2 \backslash \{0\}$ does the directional derivative $(D_uf)(0,0)$ exist? Is $f$ differentiable in $(0,0)$ ? Is $f$ a $C^1$ function? To show that $f$ is continuous at $(0,0)$ , we need to show that $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}f(x,y)=f(0,0)=0$ . We can do this by using the epsilon-delta definition of a limit. To do this, we need to show that for every $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that if $||(x,y) - (0,0)|| < \delta$ , then $|f(x,y) - f(0,0)| < \epsilon$ . Let $\epsilon > 0$ and take $\delta = \sqrt{\epsilon}$ . If $||(x,y) - (0,0)|| < \delta$ , then we have: \begin{align*} |f(x,y) - f(0,0)| &= ||\frac{x^2\sin y^2}{x^2+y^4} - 0|| \ &= |\frac{x^2\sin y^2}{x^2+y^4}| \ & \leq |\frac{x^2\sin y^2}{x^2}| \ & \leq |\frac{x^2y^2}{x^2}| = y^2 \ & \leq x^2 + y^2 = \delta^2 = \epsilon. \end{align*} Here, we used that $x^2 \leq x^2 + y^4$ , since $y^4 \geq 0$ for all $y$ and observed that $0 \leq |\sin y^2| \leq 1$ for all $y$ . Thus, the limit of the function exists at 0 and $f$ is continuous at 0. We prove this using the definition of partial derivative. We have $(D_jf)(a) := \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(a + te_j) - f(a)}{t}$ with $a = (0 \quad 0)^T$ . Thus: \begin{align*} (D_1f)(0,0) & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f\left(\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \ 0 \ \end{array}\right) + t\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \ 0 \ \end{array}\right)\right) - 0}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(t,0) - 0}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{t^2\sin(0^2)}{t^2 + 0^4} - 0}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{t^2 \cdot 0}{t^2}}{t}\ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{0}{t^3} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} 0 \ & = 0 \end{align*} and \begin{align*} (D_2f)(0,0) & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f\left(\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \ 0 \ \end{array}\right) + t\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \ 1 \ \end{array}\right)\right) - 0}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(0,t) - 0}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{0^2\sin(t^2)}{0^2 + t^4} - 0}{t}\ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{0}{t^4}}{t}\ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{0}{t^5} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} 0 \ & = 0. \end{align*} So the partial derivatives $(D_1f)(0,0)$ and $(D_2f)(0,0)$ exist. We look at the definition of the directional derivative $(D_uf)(0,0) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(a + tu) - f(a)}{t}$ . For $a = (0 \quad 0)^T$ , this gives (with $u := (u_1, u_2)$ ): \begin{align*} \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(a + tu) - f(a)}{t} &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(tu)}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(t(u_1, u_2))}{t} \ &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(tu_1, tu_2)}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{t^2u_1^2 \cdot \sin(t^2u_2^2)}{t^2u_1^2 + t^4u_2^4}}{t} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{t^2u_1^2 \cdot \sin(t^2u_2^2)}{t^3u_1^2 + t^5u_2^4} \ & = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{u_1^2\sin(t^2u_2^2)}{tu_1^2 + t^3u_2^4}\ & = \frac{u_1^2\sin(0^2 u_2^2)}{0u_1^2 + 0^3u_2^4} \ & = \frac{0}{0}. \end{align*} So for no $u \in \mathbb{R}^2 \backslash {0}$ , the directional derivative $(D_uf)(0,0)$ exists. We use the theorem that says when $f$ is differentiable in $a$ , then the partial derivatives $(D_jf_i)(a)$ exist and we have the total derivative $Df(a)$ . ?? To show that $f$ is a $C^1$ function, we need to show that the partial derivatives exist and are continuous on $\mathbb{R}^2$ . The partial derivatives of $f$ are: \begin{align*} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) &= \frac{2x\sin y^2 (x^2+y^4) - x^2\sin y^2 \cdot 2x}{(x^2+y^4)^2} \ &= \frac{2x\sin y^2 (y^4)}{(x^2+y^4)^2}, \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y) &= \frac{x^2 \cdot 2y\cos y^2 (x^2+y^4) - x^2\sin y^2 \cdot 4y^3}{(x^2+y^4)^2} \ \end{align*} Both partial derivatives are continuous on $\mathbb{R}^2$ since they are defined as quotients of continuous functions with denominators that do not become zero. Therefore, $f$ is a $C^1$ function on $\mathbb{R}^2$ .","I would like to know if you think my answers are correct, I am not so sure about and and I don't know how to answer .

There is the proof: We first assume that $X$ is a real normed linear space and, consequently, that $f$ is a real-linear bounded functional on $M$ . If $||f||$ $=$ $0$ , the desired extension is $F$ $=$ $0$ . Omitting this case, there is no loss of generality in assuming that $||f||$ $=$ $1$ . Choose $x_0$ $\in$ $X$ , $x_0$ $\notin$ $M$ , and let $M_1$ be the vector space spanned by $M$ and $x_0$ . Then $M_1$ consists of all vectors of the form $x$ $+$ $\lambda x_0$ , where $x$ $\in$ $M$ and $\lambda$ is a real scalar. If we define $f_1(x + \lambda x_0)$ $=$ $f(x)$ $+$ $\lambda \alpha$ , where $\alpha$ is any fixed real number, it is trivial to verify that an extension of $f$ to a linear functional on $M_1$ is obtained. The problem is to choose $\alpha$ so that the extended functional still has norm $1$ . This will be the case provided that $|f(x) + \lambda \alpha |$ $\leq$ $|| x + \lambda x_0||$ ( $x$ $\in$ $M$ , $\lambda$ real). Replace $x$ by $-\lambda x$ and divide both sides of $|f(x) + \lambda \alpha |$ $\leq$ $|| x + \lambda x_0||$ by $|\lambda|$ . The requirement is then that $|f(x) - \alpha|$ $\leq$ $||x-x_0||$ ( $x$ $\in$ $M$ ), i.e., that $A_x$ $\leq$ $\alpha$ $\leq$ $B_x$ for all $x$ $\in$ $M$ , where $A_x$ $=$ $f(x)$ $-$ $||x-x_0||$ and $B_x$ $=$ $f(x)$ $+$ $||x-x_0||$ .

82,Rietz representation theorem for local statements of theorems,Rietz representation theorem for local statements of theorems,,"I've known about Rietz representation theorem for some time, but I've always wondered if I got it right or I am missing something about local statements of theorems which make use of it. The Riesz theorem (let me state it for $\mathbb{R}$ not to complicate things) says that the dual of $C_0 (\mathbb{R})$ is the set $\mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R})$ of finite Radon measures on $\mathbb{R}$ , where $C_0$ denotes the functions vanishing at infinity. So $$(C_0 (\mathbb{R}))^* = \mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R}) $$ The main advantage here is that for a bounded sequence of finite Radon measures (with respect to the total variation if I am not mistaken), we have weak-star compactness by standard functional analysis results. Really nice. Now, very often it's used (implicitly) another version of the theorem, which basically says $$ (C_c (\mathbb{R}))^* = \mathcal{M}_{loc} (\mathbb{R}),$$ where $C_c (\mathbb{R})$ denotes the set of continuous functions supported in a compact set and $\mathcal{M}_{loc}$ . And so the weak-star convergence here is with respect to the functions in $C_c$ . The question is: are these two always interchangeable? I mean, the first veriosn provides a sort of more ""global"" behavior, the second one a completely local one. After all, the restriction of a locally finite Radon measure to a compact set is a finite Radon measure.

The Riesz theorem (let me state it for not to complicate things) says that the dual of is the set of finite Radon measures on , where denotes the functions vanishing at infinity. So The main advantage here is that for a bounded sequence of finite Radon measures (with respect to the total variation if I am not mistaken), we have weak-star compactness by standard functional analysis results. Really nice. Now, very often it's used (implicitly) another version of the theorem, which basically says where denotes the set of continuous functions supported in a compact set and . And so the weak-star convergence here is with respect to the functions in . The question is: are these two always interchangeable?

I'm still going to school, but I hope the formalism isn't to horrible. I started by defining injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity with respect to a single variable for multivariable functions: Def : A funtion $f(x,y):\mathbb{R}²\to\mathbb{R}$ is injective/surjective/bijective  with respect to $x$ if and only if $f_y(x)=f(x,y)$ is injective/surjective/bijective for all $y\in\mathbb{R}$ . I thought that I proved the Proposition that $f(x_0,y_0)=x_0$ was true if $f(f(x_0,y_0),y_0)=x_0$ is true and $f$ is bijective w.r.t. x and continuous, but I found some counter examples. One of them is $f(x,y)=\cos(y)-x³$ . I wanted to illustrate this with some pictures, but sadly I haven't gotten any reputation yet, so I can't post any. First I ""proved"" a Lemma : If the the system of equations $$f(x)=y\\f(y)=x$$ has any solutions and $f$ is continuous, x=y is true for at least one of them (this seems kind of obvious, but I couldn't find a proof online). Proof by contradiction: assume $f(x)\neq x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ . It follows from continuity that $f(x)<x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x)>x$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$ . For $f(x)<x$ this means that $f(f(x))<f(x)<x$ , but the original system of equations means that $f(f(x))=x$ . This is a contradiction.

Proof : Assume $f$ is bijective w.r.t $x$ and continuous and $f(f(x_0,y_0),y_0)=x_0$ . It follows from bijectivity that there is exactly one $x':=f(x_0,y_0)$ that solves this with $f(x',y_0)=x_0$ . Fix $y_0$ and set $f_y(x)=f(x,y_0)$ . Then we have $f_y(x_0)=x'$ and $f_y(x')=x_0$ . It follows from the Lemma that $x_0=x'$ for at least one solution, but since $f_y$ is bijective this is the only solution. This means that $f(x_0, y_0)=x_0.$ q.e.d. But as I said earlier there are some counter examples, though it does seem like $f(x_0, y_0)=x_0$ is really true when $f$ is bijective w.r.t. $x$ and continuous and $f(f(f(x_0,y_0),y_0),y_0)=x_0$ , though I haven't proved that yet.

92,A domain satisfying the weak cone condition but not the strong cone condition,A domain satisfying the weak cone condition but not the strong cone condition,,"In the 1977 paper ""Cone Conditions and Properties of Sobolev Spaces"" by Adams and Fournier, the authors say that an open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the cone condition if each $x\in\Omega$ is the vertex of a cone $C_x$ contained in $\Omega$ congruent to a fixed cone $C$ . They then go on to define the weak cone condition. Let $x\in\Omega$ . Let $R(x)$ consist of all points $y\in\Omega$ such that the line segment from $x$ to $y$ lies completey $\Omega$ . Let $\Gamma(x)=\{y\in R(x) : |x-y|<1\}$ . $\Omega$ satisfies the weak cone condition if there is a number $\delta>0$ such that $\mu_n(\Gamma(x))\geq \delta$ . Here $\mu_n(\Gamma(x))$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of $\Gamma(x)$ . The authors note that there are many domains satisfying the weak cone condition, but not the ""strong"" cone condition. Does anyone know an example of such a domain? I've tried to construct one but have had no luck. Here are a couple of my thoughts: Any domain $\Omega$ failing the cone condition must not contain a smallest cone. That is, there cannot be an $x\in\Omega$ such that for any other $y\in\Omega$ , the cone $C_x$ may be rigidly transformed to have its vertex coincide with $y$ , and $C_x\subset C_y$ . If such an $x$ exists, then we can take our fixed reference cone to be $C_x$ and then $\Omega$ satisfies the cone condition.
