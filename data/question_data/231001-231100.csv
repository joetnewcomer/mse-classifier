1,Are there structures other than orderings that refine cardinality?,Are there structures other than orderings that refine cardinality?,,"Two sets are of the same cardinality if a bijection exists between the two sets.

What puts me off is that since the proposition is not true for $n=0$, we just throw it into the set to conclude that $K=\omega$, not $K=\omega\setminus\{0\}$. Shouldn't we start the base case at $n=1$ instead? Why is it still acceptable to begin at $0$ if the proposition is not actually true for $0$?",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'induction']"

For each $k \in \mathbb R$ , let $\hat k \in \mathcal F(X, \mathbb R)$ with $\hat k(x) = k$ for all $x \in X$ . (1) Show $\mathcal C = \{\hat k: k \in \mathbb R\}$ is a linear subspace of $\mathcal F(X, \mathbb R)$ (2) Let $\alpha: \mathcal C \to \mathbb R$ as $\alpha(\hat k) = k$ . Show $\alpha$ is bijective and for any $k, k' \in \mathbb R, \ \alpha(\hat k + \hat {k'}) = \alpha(\hat k) + \alpha(\hat {k'})$ (1) I just want to see if I understand what they are asking and see if I can do it. By definition, $\hat k$ is in the set of real-valued functions on $X$ and so $\mathcal C \subseteq \mathcal F(X, \mathbb R)$ . Now we just have to show $\mathcal C$ satisfies all the axioms of the real valued vector space. For example, we must show $a \cdot (\hat j + \hat {j'}) = a \cdot \hat j + a \cdot \hat {j'}$ for $a \in \mathbb R, \hat j, \hat {j'} \in \mathcal C$ which is true because by definition of operations on real valued functions $a \cdot (\hat j + \hat {j'})(x) = a((\hat j + \hat {j'})(x)) = a(\hat j(x) + \hat {j'}(x)) = a\hat j(x) + a\hat {j'}(x)$ and $(a \cdot \hat j + a \cdot \hat {j'})(x) = (a \cdot \hat j)(x) + (a \cdot \hat {j'})(x) = a\hat j(x) + a\hat {j'}(x)$ . We check the rest of the axioms in a similar manner. Does that make sense ?

I can link the set of lecture notes it originated from, but the document is quite large, so it's probably better if I paraphrase it, adding details I thought were helpful at understanding (so if I'm incorrect, I'd appreciate if someone would point it out). I'll stop at the steps I didn't follow. For anyone interested, the proof is located on page 10 of this document . Theorem. If $|A| \leq |B|$ and $|B| \leq |A|$ , then $|A| = |B|$ . Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. If not, replace $A$ with $A \times \{0\}$ and $B$ with $B \times \{1\}$ , where $0 = \emptyset$ and $1 = \{\emptyset\}$ . Then $|A| = |A \times \{0\}|$ via the bijection $a \mapsto (a,0)$ . and $|B| = |B \times \{1\}|$ via the bijection $b \mapsto (b,1)$ . Therefore, if we establish that $|A \times \{0\}| = |B \times \{1\}|$ , where $A \times \{0\}$ and $B \times \{1\}$ are disjoint, then composing maps gives $|A| = |B|$ . Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to A$ be injections, and define $$ F = f \cup g: A \cup B \to A \cup B, $$ which is well-defined since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint. As $f$ and $g$ are injective, so is $F$ . Indeed, if $F(x) = F(x')$ , then because $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, either $x,x' \in A$ or $x,x' \in B$ ; indeed, if $x \in A$ and $x' \in B$ (or vice-versa), then $F(x) = g\in B$ and $F(x') \in A$ , and $F(x) \neq F(x')$ by disjointness. If $x,x' \in A$ , then $F(x) = f(x)$ , $F(x') = f(x')$ , and we have $f(x) = f(x')$ , so $x = x'$ by injectivity of $f$ . Similarly, if $x,x' \in B$ , then $F(x) = F(x')$ , so $g(x) = g(x')$ , so $x = x'$ by injectivity of $g$ . So $F$ is injective. We say that $F(x)$ is the child of $x$ , and $x$ is the parent of $F(x)$ . Then every $x \in A \cup B$ has only one parent, and because $F$ is a well-defined function and sends every input to a unique output, every parent has exactly one child. A godfather is defined as a parent that is no one's child. I think I understand the concept of a ""godfather."" A godfather is a parent, meaning that it has a unique child $x \in A \cup B$ and is of the form $F(x)$ , but is not itself the image of an element of $x \in A \cup B$ ; if $y = F(x)$ is the godfather, then $y \neq f(t)$ for every $t \in A \cup B$ . So a godfather is an element of $A \cup B \setminus f(A \cup B)$ , an element of the codomain of $F$ but not its image. I don't understand the next sentence and it's crucial for defining the bijection, so I'm going to quote it in full. ""For any $x \in A \cup B$ , either $x$ is descended from a unique godfather (possibly from $x$ itself), or $x$ has no godfather; it has an infinite line of ancestors (or $x$ is descended from itself.)"" I can't tell whether, in the case where $x$ is descended from itself, which I assume means $F(x) = x$ , whether $x$ is a godfather or whether it counts in the section that has no godfather. The proof seems to include it in both. Without the second mention, I think I understand. Let's say $x$ is in the image of $F$ . Then I attempt to trace its lineage, first by reversing the arrow $F$ and then retracing $f$ and $g$ . If I end up at an element of $A \cup B \setminus f(A \cup B)$ , then it falls into the category of descending from a unique godfather. Because $f$ and $g$ are injective and $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, I can only trace back its lineage in a single way, so there's a unique such godfather. If its lineage regressed ad infinitum and doesn't end up in $A \cup B \setminus f(A \cup B)$ , then it's in the latter described category. Now suppose that $x$ is not in the image of $F$ . It's certainly in the domain of either $f$ or $g$ , so I simply start with these arrows and continue to follow them until I either end up at $A \cup B \setminus f(A \cup B)$ or it regressed ad infinitum. Moving on: Partition $A$ into three pieces as follows. Let $A_0$ be the elements of $A$ with no godfather, $A_A$ be the elements of $A$ whose godfather is in $A$ , and $A_B$ be the elements of $A$ whose godfather is in $B$ . Partition $B$ similarly. The proof then argues there is a bijection between $A_0$ and $B_0$ , a bijection between $A_A$ and $B_A$ , and a bijection between $A_B$ and $B_B$ . Between $A_0$ and $B_0$ : The map sends $a \in A_0$ to its child $F(a)$ . This map is injective since $F$ is injective, and so the restriction of $F$ to $A_0$ is not injective. It argues that the map is surjective because every element of $B_0$ has a parent and this element must live in $A_0$ . I'm confused on both of these points. If an element of $A \cup B$ is not in the image of $F$ , doesn't it lack a parent? Why must the parent live in $A_0$ ? This proof I'm not able to fully follow. I also don't see why $F(a) \in B_0$ . The map between $A_A$ and $B_A$ again sends $a \in A_A$ to $F(a)$ . I'm again having trouble understanding why the image is in $B_A$ and $B_B$ , respectively. I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me understand the proof. My questions are: On the line regarding $x$ being descended from itself: does that mean $F(x) = x$ , and does that correspond to $x$ having no godfather? Understanding the bijections between $A_0$ and $B_0$ , $A_A$ and $B_A$ , and $A_B$ and $B_B$ , why the image of $a$ under these maps is in the respective subset of $B$ , and how we can be certain that the maps are surjective.","I'm trying to understand a proof of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem.

I can't tell whether, in the case where is descended from itself, which I assume means , whether is a godfather or whether it counts in the section that has no godfather. The proof seems to include it in both. Without the second mention, I think I understand. Let's say is in the image of . Then I attempt to trace its lineage, first by reversing the arrow and then retracing and . If I end up at an element of , then it falls into the category of descending from a unique godfather. Because and are injective and and are disjoint, I can only trace back its lineage in a single way, so there's a unique such godfather. If its lineage regressed ad infinitum and doesn't end up in , then it's in the latter described category. Now suppose that is not in the image of . It's certainly in the domain of either or , so I simply start with these arrows and continue to follow them until I either end up at or it regressed ad infinitum. Moving on: Partition into three pieces as follows. Let be the elements of with no godfather, be the elements of whose godfather is in , and be the elements of whose godfather is in . Partition similarly. The proof then argues there is a bijection between and , a bijection between and , and a bijection between and . Between and : The map sends to its child . This map is injective since is injective, and so the restriction of to is not injective. It argues that the map is surjective because every element of has a parent and this element must live in . I'm confused on both of these points. If an element of is not in the image of , doesn't it lack a parent? Why must the parent live in ? This proof I'm not able to fully follow. I also don't see why . The map between and again sends to . I'm again having trouble understanding why the image is in and , respectively. I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me understand the proof. My questions are: On the line regarding being descended from itself: does that mean , and does that correspond to having no godfather? Understanding the bijections between and , and , and and , why the image of under these maps is in the respective subset of , and how we can be certain that the maps are surjective.","|A| \leq |B| |B| \leq |A| |A| = |B| A B A A \times \{0\} B B \times \{1\} 0 = \emptyset 1 = \{\emptyset\} |A| = |A \times \{0\}| a \mapsto (a,0) |B| = |B \times \{1\}| b \mapsto (b,1) |A \times \{0\}| = |B \times \{1\}| A \times \{0\} B \times \{1\} |A| = |B| f: A \to B g: B \to A

50,Functions of finite subsets of a set,Functions of finite subsets of a set,,"I found an old exam and this question appeared: Let $X$ be a set and $X^{fin}$ denote the set of all finite subsets of $X$ . We say for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ that $X$ is $n$ -good if there exists a function $f:X^{fin}\rightarrow X^{fin}$ such that for all subsets $A$ of cardinality $n$ there exists $B\subsetneq A$ such that $A\subseteq f(B)$ . Show that $X$ is $n+2$ -good iff $|X|\leq \aleph_n$ . Edit: This problem makes since contrary to what I initially thought. For the case where $n=0$ we have that if $\vert X \vert\leq \aleph_0$ then if it is finite we can simply set the function to be the constant function $f(A)=X$ as Erick Wofsey pointed out or you could just send the empty set to $X$ and leave everything constant. In the case where $\vert X \vert=\aleph_0$ we can wlog asume $X=\omega$ and let $f$ send $\{a\}\mapsto a+1=\{0,1,\dots,a\}$ This funciton has the desired property. Edit 2: I believe I have a solution for the $(\leftarrow)$ implication: We proceed by induction on $n$ and we already shown the base case. Wlog we can assume that $X=\omega_{n+1}$ . For each $\alpha\in\omega_{n+1}$ we have it's one of it's initial segments so it's cardinality is $\aleph_n$ so there is a $n$ -good function $f_\alpha:\alpha^{fin}\rightarrow\alpha^{fin}$ by the induction hypothesis.

51,Left inverse iff injective; Right inverse iff surjective,Left inverse iff injective; Right inverse iff surjective,,"I'm trying to make the below proof as rigorous as possible, but I am not completely certain on how to phrase several steps and their justifications. The statement is: Let $f: X \to Y$ be a map of sets. A function $g: Y \to X$ is called a left (resp. right) inverse of $f$ if $g \circ f = \mathrm{id}_X$ (resp. $f \circ g = \mathrm{id}_Y$ ). Show that $f$ admits a right inverse if and only if $f$ is surjective (onto). Show that, in general, a right inverse is not unique. Show that $f$ admits a left inverse if and only if $f$ is injective (one-to-one). Show that, in general, a left inverse is not unique. The prompt doesn't require that $X,Y $ be nonempty, so I felt the need to first rule out these ""edge cases."" We first rule out the edge cases. Notice that if one of $X$ or $Y$ is empty, then the other must be empty for this result to hold. Indeed, if $X = \emptyset$ , then $f: X \to Y$ is only defined if $Y = \emptyset$ . Similarly, if $Y = \emptyset$ , then a function $g: Y \to X$ is defined only if $X = \emptyset$ . So if $X = Y = \emptyset$ , then $f: X \to Y$ , the empty function, is vacuously bijective and is, in fact, its own inverse. We proceed under the assumption that $X,Y \neq \emptyset$ . I'm not sure if this above explanation is fully rigorous. Here's now my attempt at the forward direction for part (a). Suppose that $f$ admits a right inverse $g: Y \to X$ . Given $y \in Y$ , there exists a unique $x \in X$ such that $g(y) = x$ . But then $$f(g(y)) = (f \circ g)(y) = \mathrm{id}_Y (y) = y = f(x),$$ so $f$ is surjective. I'm fairly confident in this forward direction, but less so in the backward direction. Conversely, suppose that $f$ is surjective. Define the function $g: Y \to X$ sending $y \longmapsto x$ for some preimage $x \in f^{-1} (y)$ . In the case where the preimage of $y$ in $x$ is non-unique, we apply the axiom of the choice to pick a single $x$ . Given $y \in Y$ with corresponding $x = g(y)$ , we have \begin{align*} (f \circ g)(y) = f(g(y)) = f(x) = y,  \end{align*} so $f \circ g = \mathrm{id}_Y$ , and $f$ admits a right inverse. My key point of confusion is whether it makes sense to ""define"" $x$ as $g(y)$ . The more rigorous approach seems to be to argue that $f \circ g = \mathrm{id}_Y$ by definition, or perhaps there's a better argument. For lack of uniqueness, here's what I came up with. I'll be defining $\mathbb{Z}/2 = \{0,1\}$ with addition given by $(a,b) \mapsto$ $a + b$ if $a + b < 2$ and $a + b - 2$ otherwise. I claim that a right inverse is not in general unique. Consider the reduction map $$ \begin{array}{rccl} f \colon & \mathbb{Z} & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{Z}/2  \\ & a & \longmapsto & a \text{ mod $2$}. \end{array} $$ Notice that $f$ is surjective, but $1,3 \in f^{-1} (1)$ , so we can define right inverses $g_1: Y \to X$ sending $$ y \longmapsto \begin{cases} 1, \; \text{ if $y = 1$} \\ 0, \; \text{ if $y = 0$} \end{cases} $$ and $g_2: Y \to X$ sending $$ y \longmapsto \begin{cases} 3, \; \text{ if $y = 3$} \\ 0, \; \text{ if $y = 0$}. \end{cases} $$ Given $y \in \mathbb{Z}/2$ , we then have \begin{align*} (f \circ g_1)(y) = f(g_1 (y)) = \begin{cases} f(1), \; \text{ if $y = 1$} \\ f(0), \; \text{ if $y = 0$}  \end{cases} \hspace{-2.5mm} = \begin{cases} 1, \; \text{ if $y = 1$} \\ 0, \; \text{ if $y = 0$}  \end{cases} \end{align*} so $f \circ g = \mathrm{id}_Y$ . Similarly, for any $y \in \mathbb{Z}/2$ , we have \begin{align*} (f \circ g_2)(y) = f(g_2 (y)) = \begin{cases} f(3), \; \text{ if $y = 1$} \\ f(0), \; \text{ if $y = 0$}  \end{cases} \hspace{-2.5mm} = \begin{cases} 1, \; \text{ if $y = 1$} \\ 0, \; \text{ if $y = 0$} \end{cases}, \end{align*} so $f \circ g_2 = \mathrm{id}_Y$ , so $g_1 \neq g_2$ are both right inverses of $f$ . I believe the above is correct unless there is a more 'general' approach than a simple counterexample. Now, for part (b), beginning with the forward direction. Suppose that $f$ admits a left inverse $g: Y \to X$ . Given $a,b \in X$ for which $f(a) = f(b)$ , we have \begin{align*} a = \mathrm{id}_X (a) = (g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(f(b)) = (g \circ f)(b) = \mathrm{id}_X (b) = b, \end{align*} so $f$ is injective. Again, I feel fairly confident about the forward direction, but less so about the backward direction. Suppose that $f: X \to Y$ is injective. Fix $x_0 \in X$ , and define the map $g: Y \to X$ by $$  y \longmapsto \begin{cases} x, \; & \text{ if $y = f(x)$ for some $x \in X$} \\ x_0, \; & \text{ if $y \not \in f(X)$} \end{cases} $$ This map is well-defined because if $y \in f(X)$ , its preimage in $X$ is unique because $f$ is injective. Then, for any $x \in X$ for which $f(x) = y$ for a unique $y \in Y$ , we have \begin{align*} (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(y) = y, \end{align*} so $g \circ f = \mathrm{id}_X$ , as desired. Again, I'm not sure if it's fully rigorous to define $f(x) = y$ , or if I should argue that $x$ is the unique element of $X$ mapping to $y$ or, simply, that $g \circ f = \mathrm{Id}_X$ by definition. Here is the final step that a left inverse isn't unique. I claim that a left inverse is not, in general, unique. Let $X = \{1,2\}$ and $Y = \{3,4,5\}$ , and define the map $f: X \to Y$ by $1 \longmapsto 3$ , $2 \longmapsto 4$ . Then we can define the following two inverses: \begin{align*} & g_1: Y \to X, \; 3 \longmapsto 1, 4 \longmapsto 2, 5 \longmapsto 1 \\ & g_1: Y \to X, \; 3 \longmapsto 1, 4 \longmapsto 2, 5 \longmapsto 2. \end{align*} How do these look? My main concerns, as I noted, are (1) the edge cases; (2) the proof that I constructed a proper left inverse; (3) the proof that I constructed a proper right inverse; and (4) the way to notate the left inverse $g: Y \to A$ , because the definition, though it is well-defined, sounds as though it isn't well-defined (i.e., the ""for some $x \in X$ "").","I'm trying to make the below proof as rigorous as possible, but I am not completely certain on how to phrase several steps and their justifications.

Now consider the set $E_{1} = \{x_{1}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{r}\}$ . Because none of the $x_{i}, i = 1,2, \ldots, r,$ lies in the intersection of all the $E_{j}$ (this intersection being empty), it follows that for each $i$ we can find some $E_{{j}_{i}}$ such that $x_{i} \notin E_{{j}_{i}}$ . Then \begin{align} E_{1} \cap E_{{i}_{1}} \cap E_{{i}_{2}} \cap \ldots \cap E_{{i}_{r}} = \emptyset \end{align} Since, at the sametime, this intersection is included in $E_{1}$ and does not contain any element of $E_{1}$ . But this contradicts the hypothesis. It follows that our initial assumption was false, and hence the sets from the family $F$ have a nonempty intersection. My Argument This becomes a problem given that the intersection of any $r+1$ sets in $F$ are not necessarily distinct. Thus if we take $E_{1}$ and intersect with itself $r+1$ times, the intersection is not empty. However, we note that it would be possible to come up with a set $F$ where $E_{1}, \ldots, E_{s}$ do not intersect for a given $X$ . And thus provides a counter example to the problem. Comments I don't think their proof is correct either given that we are picking $E_{{i}_{r}}$ to make sure the set intersection is empty. This is an invalid choice because it does not fit the narrative of the original question of being not necessarily distinct intersection. Any insight or help into understanding this proof would be helpful. Note this problem comes from Putnam and Beyond as an example in the first section.","Let be a family of subsets with elements of some set .

61,Proving $k^2 \leq 2^{2^{k}}$ from Kuratowski's definition of ordered pair. Is it possible to extend this?,Proving  from Kuratowski's definition of ordered pair. Is it possible to extend this?,k^2 \leq 2^{2^{k}},"If we use Kuratowski's definition of an ordered pair, we have that $\left(a,b\right)=\left\{\left\{a\right\},\left\{a,b\right\}\right\}$ , where $a,b\in X$ and $\left(a,b\right)\in X\times X$ . However, note that this definition also implies that $\left(a,b\right)\in\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)$ . Suppose that $X$ is a finite set with $k$ elements. Then, it's not hard to prove that $|X\times X|=k^{2}$ and $|\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)|=2^{k}$ , which gives us $|\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)|=2^{2^{k}}$ . Given that this definition of ordered pairs implies that $X\times X\subseteq \mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)$ , that would make this a valid proof that $k^{2}\leq 2^{2^{k}}$ for all integers $k\geq1$ . Question: Can this definition be extended to ordered $n$ -tuples to prove similar inequalities for $k^{n}$ ? If so, what does it looks like? If not, why not? I know that we can recursively define ordered triples by $$\left(a,b,c\right)=\left(\left(a,b\right),c\right)=\left\{\left\{\left(a,b\right)\right\},\left\{\left(a,b\right),c\right\}\right\}$$ $$=\left\{\left\{\left\{\left\{a\right\},\left\{a,b\right\}\right\}\right\},\left\{\left\{\left\{a\right\},\left\{a,b\right\}\right\},c\right\}\right\},$$ and so on for ordered $n$ -tuples. However, this definition means that $\left(a,b,c\right)$ is not the member of any level of power set of $X$ (not $\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)$ , $\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)$ , $\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)\right)$ , etc.), which means that we can't use (a slightly modified form of) the original argument to find an inequality for $k^{3}$ . Since $2^{5} > 2^{2^{2}}$ , this means that the ordered $5$ -tuples of elements of $X$ can't be contained inside of $\mathscr{P}\left(\mathscr{P}\left(X\right)\right)$ (at least for $X$ with at least $2$ elements), which means defining higher-order ordered tuples that are consistent with the original Kuratowski definition but also extend it in a way that allows for further power set-related inequality arguments will require a deeper nesting of power sets, if such a definition exists. Note: The inequalities that would be found using this would be terribly loose to the point of being beyond trivial. Since there are no integers $k\geq1$ with $k^{3}$ or $k^{4}$ greater than $2^{2^{k}}$ , the further nesting of exponential functions that will result from the nesting of power sets needed to define ordered triples and ordered $4$ -tuples will already lead to inequalities that are extremely weak.","If we use Kuratowski's definition of an ordered pair, we have that , where and .

Assume that it is true for $n=k$, then $$\left |\bigcup_{i=1}^kA_i\right|=\sum_{J\in A}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$$ First, notice that $-\sum_{J\in A}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}(A_j\cap A_{k+1})\right|$ $=-\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\cup x\mid x\in A\}}(-1)^{(\left|J\right|-1)-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ $=\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\cup x\mid x\in A\}}(-1)^{(\left|J\right|-1)-1+1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ $=\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\cup x\mid x\in A\}}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ For $n=k+1$, we have that $\left |\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1}A_i\right|$ $=\left |(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_i)\cup A_{k+1}\right|$ $=\left |\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_i\right|+\left |A_{k+1}\right|-\left |(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_i)\cap A_{k+1}\right|$ [It's clear the theorem for $n=2$] $=\left |\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_i\right|+\left |A_{k+1}\right|-\left |\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}(A_i\cap A_{k+1})\right|$ $=\sum_{J\in A}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|+\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\}}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|-\sum_{J\in A}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}(A_j\cap A_{k+1})\right|$ $\text{ [We apply inductive hypothesis in which the theorem is true for $n=k$]}$ $=\sum_{J\in A}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|+\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\}}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|+\sum_{J\in \{\{k+1\}\cup x\mid x\in A\}}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ $=\sum_{J\in A\cup\{\{k+1\}\}\cup\{\{k+1\}\cup x\mid x\in A\}}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ $=\sum_{J\in B}(-1)^{\left|J\right|-1}\left|\bigcap_{j\in J}A_j\right|$ Thus, the theorem is true for $n=k+1$. By principle of induction, Inclusion–exclusion Principle is proved. $$\tag*{$\blacksquare$}$$",,"['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification', 'proof-writing', 'inclusion-exclusion']"
