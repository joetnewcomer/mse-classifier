This problem is from assignment 5. a) Prove that the relation $x$ conjugate to $y$ in a group $G$ is an equivalence relation on $G$ . b) Describe the elements $a$ whose conjugacy class (= equivalence class) consists of the element $a$ alone. a) Let $G$ be a group and $R$ be a relation on $G$ defined by $a\sim b$ if $a$ is conjugate to $b$ .  Then $a\sim b$ if there is a $g\in G$ such that $a = gbg^{-1}$ .  Let $a$ be an element of $G$ .  Then $a=eae^{-1}$ .  So $a\sim a$ and $R$ is reflexive.  Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of $G$ such that $a\sim b$ .  Then there is a $g\in G$ such that $a=gbg^{-1}$ .  Then $b=g^{-1}ag$ .  Since $g^{-1}\in G$ , $b\sim a$ .  Hence, $R$ is symmetric.

28,Are Lie algebras of non-isomorphic central simple algebras non-isomorphic?,Are Lie algebras of non-isomorphic central simple algebras non-isomorphic?,,"Comments to my answer to this MO question , which is isomorphic to this MSE question , point out that I was tacitly assuming that the associated Lie algebras to non-isomorphic quaternion algebras over $\mathbb Q$ remain non-isomorphic. This should have a simple, decisive answer, but I'm unable to really get anywhere. Specifically, let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be central simple algebras over a field $k$ (of characteristic zero, but not algebraically closed), so $A_i\simeq M_{n_i}(D_i)$, where $D_i$ is a division algebra. Put a Lie algebra structure on the $A_i$ in the standard way by $[x,y]=xy-yx$. Write ${\rm Lie}(A_i)$ for $A_i$ considered as a Lie algebra. The question is: If ${\rm Lie}(A_1)\simeq{\rm Lie}(A_2)$, is $A_1\simeq A_2$? If the $A_i$ are not central (meaning the center strictly contains $k$), the answer is no. For example, if $K$ is a quadratic extension of $k$, then $K$ and $k^2$ will be isomorphic as Lie algebras (since they are isomorphic as vector spaces and both have trivial bracket operation). [Edit: Of course, $k^2$ is not simple. To salvage this example, replace $k^2$ with a second quadratic extension $K'$.] Added later: Coming back to this, assume $A_1$ is split by an extension $K$ of $k$, and $A_2$ is not. Then $A_1\otimes_kK\simeq M_n(K)$, while $A_2\otimes_kK\simeq M_m(D)$, where $D$ is a non-trivial division algebra over $K$ and $n=md$. Then, we just need to show that ${\rm Lie}\big(M_n(K)\big)\not\simeq{\rm Lie}\big(M_m(D)\big)$. This would answer my question in the affirmative, under the assumption that the $A_i$ are split by different extensions. In this case, the question becomes: Is there a simple proof that ${\rm Lie}\big(M_n(K)\big)\not\simeq {\rm Lie}\big(M_m(D)\big)$? I still can't get this to work. One strategy is to show that $M_n(K)$ has a subalgebra that $M_m(D)$ can't have (e.g., by dimension considerations). (Note that the Lie subalgebras are in 1-1 correspondence with the ""normal"" subalgebras.)

37,The Galois group of polynomial $p(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ is cyclic and is generated by $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$.,The Galois group of polynomial  is cyclic and is generated by .,p(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x] q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x],"My question here is motivated by this question and that question .  The subject of particular interest is when $n=3$ and $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}$ . Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field with the algebraic closure $\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ .  For a given integer $n\geq 2$ , suppose that $$p(x)=x^n+a_1x^{n-1}+a_2x^{n-2}+\ldots+a_{n-1}x+a_n$$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{K}[x]$ such that the Galois group $G:=\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})$ of $p(x)$ over $\mathbb{K}$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$ .  We say that a polynomial $$q(x)=b_1x^{n-1}+b_2x^{n-2}+\ldots+b_{n-1}x+b_n$$ in $\mathbb{K}[x]$ augments $p(x)$ if $q$ generates $G$ .  That is, we can order the roots of $p(x)$ as $r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\in\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ in such a way that $$r_j=q(r_{j-1})$$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,n$ (where $r_0:=r_n$ ).   Furthermore, we also say that $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ of degree at most $n-1$ is an $n$ -augmentation polynomial if $q(x)$ augments some monic irreducible polynomial $p(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ of degree $n$ such that $\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})\cong C_n$ . What are $n$ -augmentation polynomials $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ for a given positive integer $n$ ? A trivial example is when $n=2$ .  Let $a_1$ be an element of $\mathbb{K}$ such that $$p(x)=x^2+a_1x+a_2$$ is irreducible for some $a_1\in\mathbb{K}$ .  Then, $$q(x)=-x-a_1$$ is a $2$ -augmentation polynomial.  These are all possible $2$ -augmentation polynomials. Let now $n>2$ . For a given $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ , let $f^{[m]}(x)$ denote the $m$ -time iteration of $f(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ .  A necessary condition is that $\tilde{q}_n(x):=\prod\limits_{d\mid n}\big(q^{[d]}(x)-x\big)^{\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)}$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n$ (here, $\mu$ is the Möbius function ).  I conjecture that this is also a sufficient condition, and any irreducible factor $p(x)$ of $\tilde{q}_n(x)$ such that $p(x)$ is monic and has degree $n$ is augmented by $q(x)$ .  Is my conjecture (restated below) true? Conjecture. A polynomial $q(x)\in\Bbb{K}[x]$ of degree less than $n$ is an $n$ -augmentation polynomial if and only if $$\tilde{q}_n(x):=\prod\limits_{d\mid n}\big(q^{[d]}(x)-x\big)^{\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)}\in\mathbb{K}[x]$$ has an irreducible factor of degree $n$ .  Furthermore, $q(x)$ augments every monic irreducible factor $p(x)$ of degree $n$ of $\tilde{q}_n(x)$ . Closing Remark. If $G:=\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})$ is cyclic, then it is generated by some $\gamma\in\text{Aut}_\mathbb{K}(\bar{\mathbb{K}})$ .  Fix a root $r_1\in\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ of $p(x)$ .  Because $G$ is cyclic (in particular, $|G|=n=\big[\mathbb{K}(r_1):\mathbb{K}\big]$ ), $p(x)$ splits into linear factors over $\mathbb{K}(r_1)$ .  Thus, $r_2:=\gamma(r_1)$ is in $\mathbb{K}(r_1)$ .  Therefore, there exists a polynomial $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ of degree less than $n$ such that $$r_2=q(r_1)\,.$$ Define $r_j:=\gamma^{[j-1]}(r_1)$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,n$ (and $r_0:=r_n$ as before).  Then, the equality above ensures that $r_j=q(r_{j-1})$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,n$ . Conversely, suppose that there exists $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ such that the roots $r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\in\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ of $p(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ satisfy $r_j=q(r_{j-1})$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,n$ .  Then, it follows that $\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})$ is generated by $q$ , whence it is a cyclic group.  Therefore, the condition that $p(x)$ has a cyclic Galois group is both necessary and sufficient for this question. However, that $p(x)$ splits into linear factors over $\mathbb{K}(r_1)$ for some root $r_1\in\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ is not sufficient for the setting of this question.  For example, when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}$ and $p(x)=x^4-10x^2+1$ , then the roots of $p$ are $\pm\sqrt{2}\pm\sqrt{3}$ , and $p(x)$ splits into linear factors over $\mathbb{Q}(r_i)$ for any root $r_i$ of $p(x)$ .  For any choice of indexes of the roots $r_i$ of $p(x)$ , you can write $r_2=q(r_1)$ for some $q(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ , you cannot expect that $r_3=q(r_2)$ , $r_4=q(r_3)$ , and $r_1=q(r_4)$ .  This is because $\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})$ is not cyclic.  It is isomorphic to $C_2\times C_2$ .  (That is, if you have $r_2=q(r_1)$ , then you will have $r_1=q(r_2)$ .)  Anyway, the condition that $p(x)$ with roots $r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n\in\bar{\mathbb{K}}$ splits into linear factors over $\mathbb{K}(r_1)$ is necessary and sufficient for the existence of polynomials $q_j(x)\in\mathbb{K}[x]$ such that $r_j=q_j(r_1)$ for all $j=1,2,\ldots,n$ , which is equivalent to the condition that $\big|\text{Gal}(p/\mathbb{K})\big|=n$ .","My question here is motivated by this question and that question .

I have attempted to generalize this (in what seems like the obvious way) and would appreciate it if someone could confirm the validity (or lack thereof) of my ""conjecture"". Let $G$ be a group with $|G|=p^nq^m$ where $p$, $q$ are distinct primes and $n, m \ge 1$.  Furthermore, assume that $p \not\mid q^k-1$ and $q \not\mid p^k-1$ for $1 \le k \le m$ and $1 \le k \le n$, respectively.  Then $G$ is abelian. Proof: Every divisor of $|G|$ is of the form $p^sq^t$ with $0 \le s \le n$ and $0 \le t \le m$.

Therefore $1$ is the only divisor of $|G|$ that is congruent to $1 \,\mbox{mod}\,p$ and $1 \, \mbox{mod}\,q$. It follows by Sylow's Third Theorem that $G$ has only one Sylow $p$-subgroup and one Sylow $q$-subgroup.  In addition, each of these subgroups is normal.  Clearly the order of their product is $|G|$ and they intersect trivially.  Furthermore, it can be shown (see proof of Theorem 24.6 in Contemporary Abstract Algebra, Gallian, 5th ed.) that all elements in these subgroups commute.

I am not sure how many operations should be given over the set, but till now I have been considering only one which is the composition of moves. So, let me give an example. The bishop b1 to c3 could be represented as a move $\phi$ and pawn $c2$ to $c3$ could be represented as another move $\chi$ . Now, in my set, the element $\phi$ followed by $\chi$ or $\chi$ followed by $\phi$ denoted as $\chi \phi$ and $\phi \chi$ does not exist because more than one piece can't be in a certain spot of the chess board. Essentially multiplication means doing one move after another. However if Bishop g1 to f3 is denoted by $\alpha$ then $\chi \alpha$ and $\alpha \chi$ is in my set because they don't cause the two pieces occupying one spot issues. In essence, closed under certain multiplications but not others. It seems so generally that I don't have associativity or commutativity. One nice property is that except for moves regarding pawns, everything in the set is actually invertible. Is there anything more which can be said in this direction or is there another direction which gives a meaningful algebraic structure on the chess board? Thanks. Note: At the moment I am thinking of free movement on the Chess Board. I am not accounting for the turn based system which is there when two people play. So, for instance black can move two turns in a row (legal to multiply black moves). However, if there is interesting results which occur from restricting it into only alternating colors moving, I'd be interested in that too.
