1,Checking my understanding: $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ... = \frac{1}{2}$,Checking my understanding:,1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ... = \frac{1}{2},"I've recently run into a proof that claims that $1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ... = \frac{1}{2}$ that proceeds as follows: Let $S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...$. Then $$S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...) = 1 - S$$ Therefore, $2S = 1$, so $S = \frac{1}{2}$. QED I was under the impression that this sum doesn't converge, and therefore this step of the proof is invalid: Let $S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...$ That is, it's not even valid to suppose that the sum is equal to some (implicitly real or complex) number $S$, and therefore the reasoning that follows is meaningless because $S$ doesn't exist and therefore has any properties we want it to have. Is the reasoning I've given above correct? That is, is it correct for me to claim that the proof fails because $S$ doesn't exist? (I've heard that there are techniques for evaluating divergent integrals by using complex analysis and Taylor series, so perhaps there's another way to prove that the summation is $\frac{1}{2}$; I just wanted to see whether my reasoning is sufficient to explain why this particular proof is incorrect. If the proof actually is correct, then I stand corrected!)

3,The minimum $N \times N$ square covering problem for $1 \times 4$ shaped tetrominoes,The minimum  square covering problem for  shaped tetrominoes,N \times N 1 \times 4,"OK, so me and my friend are working on a problem in which you do the opposite to trying to stuff as many of the I shape tetrominoes in a square as possible. Trying to find the smallest number of I shape tetrominoes that you have to place in the square such that another I shaped tetromino cannot be placed in the square. So I define $I_n$ to be the sequence such that the rules of the above problem are satisfied. My friend made a program that finds the values of this sequence. So far we have found that $I_1 = 0, \ I_2 = 0, \ I_3 = 0, \ I_4 = 4, \ I_5 = 4, \ I_6 = 6, \ I_7 = 7, \ I_8 = 9.$ The problem is that we have got no proofs for any of the cases where $n > 4$ . At first I tried using the pigeonhole principle to try to prove a few cases. For example, when $n = 5$ my argument went a little bit like this. Lets assume WLOG that an I shaped tetromino was placed in the first row of the square and that a second I shaped tetromino was placed in another row. Now we just place the third shape in the suquare, then that means that there are $5*5 - 4*3 = 13$ remaining free squares. Now using the pigeonhole principle and the assumption of the placement of the first 2 shapes we we get that $13 - 2 = 11$ of the squares are distributed on the 3 rows in which the first $2$ I shapes were not placed. Now by the pigeonhole principle we get that one of the rows must have $\lceil{\frac{11}{3}}\rceil = 4$ free squares. And this is the point where the proof breaks down. I neglected the fact that you can place other I shapes such that even if the row has 4 free squares you still cannot place a new I shape tetromino in it. So I ask anyone if they have any good ideas that can progress our investigation. P.S.  If you have proofs for your assertions, then please write them out :) Here I have added visual examples starting from $n = 5$ : $n = 5$ $n = 6$ $n = 7$ $n = 8$ I and my friend are also looking into the same problem with square tetrominoes. I have a general formula for the squares: $\lceil\frac{n-1}{3}\rceil^2$ . My proof starts off by showing how we can do a minimal covering of a $5\times n$ rectangle. We notice that if we always put new squares in such that they are one cell away from the boundaries of the rectangle and from each other, then looking through a few cases we can come to the conclusion that the formula is $\lceil\frac{n-1}{3}\rceil$ . Now the same principe of being one cell apart from everything else when it can be done also applies for the $n\times n$ case. So then the smallest count would be attained by a certain configuration (I called it the perfect configuration) of the squares. Now it is not hard to notice that the number of squares in the $n \times n$ case is simply the square of the $5 \times n$ case. My proof basically went along the lines that if you try to remove a square or displace it from the position in which it would be in the perfect configuration, then you could always add a new square, thus gaining a covering that takes up more squares then the perfect configuration one so, therefore the perfect configuration covering must be the minimal. P.S. If anyone knows any good sources or literature concerning this topic, then please do share them.

5,Finding the number of non-decreasing sequences.,Finding the number of non-decreasing sequences.,,"A sequence is non-decreasing if $k_1 \leq k_2 \leq k_3$. Now I need to  find the number of non-decreasing sequences of length-$n$ sequences from $\{1,2,....m\}$ I basically see it as sum of the numbers of strictly increasing sequences plus other sequences. The number of strictly increasing sequences of length $n$ is ${m \choose n}$ because simply any subset of length $n$ can be arranged to be form exactly one strictly increasing sequence. However, we don't have repetition of digits when we deal with strictly increasing sequences unlike non-decreasing sequences.

In total they are 11 such sequences But what equation is that ? I want to build a pattern here to arrive to my answer and hopefully generalize it. Because after this we have the case of non-decreasing sequence of $3$ digits which is basically the same number as the strictly increasing sequences which is ${m \choose n} = {4 \choose 3} = 4$ and then we add everything together, So I guess there must be a summation formula which answers this question.

Interpret this as an instruction to move place to the left. Continue in this manner, hopping through the string, alternately moving right and left.

16,"Evaluating a series to order ""three halves""","Evaluating a series to order ""three halves""",,"In doing some calculations related to one-dimensional Brownian Motion confined to a finite interval, I have come across functions such as $$ f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\exp(-n^2t)}{n^4}. $$   I am interested in the behavior of this function for small $t$. By expanding the exponential it is easy to get the terms of order 0 and 1 in $t$. However, the term of order $t^2$ diverges. I take this to mean that $f(t)$ does not have a second derivative at $t = 0$. I think (although I'm not sure) that in some sense there is a ""3/2"" order term. How does one define and calculate this term? Perhaps the limit   $$ \lim_{t \to 0}\frac{f(t) - f(0) - t f'(0)}{t^{3/2}} $$   is finite and can be calculated? Is there an unambiguous way of expanding such functions in power series with fractional powers? Background : Consider a particle undergoing one-dimensional Brownian Motion in the interval $\left[0,L\right]$ with reflecting boundary conditions. The particle has diffusion coefficient $D$ and its position is $x(t)$. Its initial position is distributed uniformly in the interval. Then one can show that the mean squared displacement at time $t$ is $$ \text{MSD}(t) \equiv \langle \left[x(t) - x(0)\right]^2\rangle =  \frac{L^2}{6} + \frac{8 L^2}{\pi^4}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{-1 + (-1)^n}{n^4} \cdot \exp(-t/\tau_n), $$ where $$ \tau_n = \frac{L^2}{n^2 \pi^2 D} $$ As I mentioned, one can calculate this up to first order in $t$. The constant term is of course zero (the particle can't travel any distance in zero time) and the first order term turns out to be $2 D t$, which makes sense since this is the MSD of a free particle (i.e. before it encounters any walls). Further Notes Here is a plot of the function $f(t)$ given by the series, as well as the approximations from Marko Riedel's answer:","In doing some calculations related to one-dimensional Brownian Motion confined to a finite interval, I have come across functions such as $$ f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\exp(-n^2t)}{n^4}. $$   I am interested in the behavior of this function for small $t$.

It arises by taking turns taking turns taking..., so: 01|01|01|01|01|01|01|01 ->   01 10|01 10|01 10|01 10 ->   01 10 10 01|01 10 10 01 ->   01 10 10 01 10 01 01 10 ... And, among many other nice properties, it happens to have the advantage the first player gets at turn 1 to converge away to 0 over time. This idea, the fairness of a given turn-order, is my sole concern here. Now there already is a question asking what the n-player generalization of the Thue-Morse-sequence is: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1549434/49989 However, all it mentions is how to generate these generalized sequences. Not whether, or in what sense they share the same properites. For instance, from that answer, here is the 3-player variant: 0, 012, 012120201, 012120201120201012201012120 arrived at by starting with 0 and using the following replacement rules: (0→012),(1→120),(2→201) Since our set now contains 3 elements which can be arranged in 6 ways, there are, however, more sequences that might ultimately be equivalent. For instance, what about the following? Is it at a disadvantage over the sequence given by the answer above? (0→021),(1→102),(2→210) 0, 021, 021210102, 021210102210102021102021210 As far as I can tell, no: All it effectively did was to switch around the players with the label 1 and 2 respectively, leaving alone 0. However, if you can pick either sequence, you could once again go with a take turns taking turns approach: (0→ 012|021 ),(1→ 120|102),(2→ 201|210) Though at this point I'm not sure which variant to take here: Either you'd just take the thue-morse sequence per-step or per-digit to determine which one of the two to pic, or perhaps each digit should have its own thue-morse sequence attached to it to pick which one to go first. Here are the first couple steps in either case (these are hand-computed so hopefully I made no mistake): thue-morse: 01101001100101101001011001101001... 3 player thue-morse per-step 0, 012, 021102210, 021210102102021210210102021,... 3 player thue-morse per-bit 0, 012, 012102210, 012102210120021210210120012,... 3 player thue-morse per-player 0, 012, 012120201, 012120201102210021210021102,... So it's probably hard to tell from those sequences what exactly I did for each of them, so let's be a bit clearer: for per-step, I simply generated each partial sequence with the substitution rules where I alternated what rule to pick per step.  0 -> 012 because the first bit of the thue-morse sequence is 0 012 -> 021102210 because the second digit is 1 021102210 -> 021210102102021210210102021 because the third bit is 1, the next step would go with the first rule set again since its bit is 0. for per-bit, I simply picked what rule to apply based on what digit we are looking at. 0 is the first digit. The first digit in the Thue-Morse-sequence is 0. Therefore, use the 1st substitution rule: |0| -> |012|. 1 is the second digit. The second digit in the Thue-Morse-sequence is 1.  Therefore, use the 2nd substitution rule: 0|1|2 -> 012|102|. 2 is the third digit. The third digit in the Thue-Morse sequence is 1. Therefore, use the 2nd substitution rule: 01|2|102 -> 012102|201|... for per-player I kept track of the occurrence of each digit individually, the 1st 0, 1, and 2 respectively would use the 1st substitution rule, the 2nd and 3rd (each corresponding to 1) the 2nd respectively, the 4th occurance the 1st again... Though except for the 1st case,  I didn't use the rule for substitution but rather as recursion, so I just tacked the next three digits to the end of the sequence based on the current digit and the current rule. And perhaps there are other fairly natural rules (the most natural-seeming one to me is the per-digit rule) Now, back to my question. As said, I'd like to know the fairest possible turn order for n players. Does the (comparatively simple) method in the answer I linked fulfill that criterion, or would that price go to a different sequence, perhaps one of my suggested alternatives? If the latter then I assume a similar generalization would have to be taken for higher player counts: For four players 0123 there could be six plausible substitution rules which could either be fixed or chosen in an alternating pattern that combines the best 3-player sequence and the thue-morse sequence.

83,Are the primes found as a subset in this sequence $a_n$?,Are the primes found as a subset in this sequence ?,a_n,"Below is a introduction that contains some background to my question. The question is found at the bottom. By calculating the eigenvalues of the matrix defined by the recurrence: $\displaystyle T(n,1)=1, T(1,k)=1, n \geq k: -\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1} T(n-i,k), n<k: -\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} T(k-i,n)$ mentioned in: Do these series converge to the von Mangoldt function? we get eigenvalues whose signs appear to be equal to a rearrangement of the Möbius function but whose magnitudes differ: Example: The $6 \times 6$ determinant equal to zero: $$\begin{vmatrix} 1-\lambda&1&1&1&1&1 \\ 1&-1-\lambda&1&-1&1&-1 \\ 1&1&-2-\lambda&1&1&-2 \\ 1&-1&1&-1-\lambda&1&-1 \\ 1&1&1&1&-4-\lambda&1 \\ 1&-1&-2&-1&1&2-\lambda \end{vmatrix}=0$$ gives eigenvalues: {-5.2439, -3.4641, 3.4641, 2.5169, -2.2730, 0} Compare this with the eigenvalues from the $7$ x $7$ determinant: {-6.8444, -5.2217, -3.4641, 3.4641, 3.0150, -1.9489, 0} From Todd Timberlake's paper ""Random numbers and random matrices: Quantum chaos meets number theory"" (2005-2006) I learned that one needs to unfold the eigenvalues in order to plot their distribution. I did not understand the unfolding process so I asked Todd Timberlake via email how to do it for a finite list of eigenvalues (all in all $11$ eigenvalues in my mail). In the answer he said that the unfolding approximation method should not be applied to only $11$ eigenvalues. From his paper I also read the following sentence: ""Furthermore, it indicates that if the prime numbers are eigenvalues of some quantum system, then the classical counterpart of that system should be integrable."" Putting the lambdas "" $\lambda$ "" along the diagonal rarely seems to give integer values. Instead we can try putting them at all elements: $$\begin{vmatrix} 1-\lambda&1-\lambda \\ 1-\lambda&-1-\lambda \end{vmatrix}=0$$ This gives the equation: $$-2 + 2 \lambda = 0$$ and we see that $\lambda$ is integer. Now this works up to a $4$ x $4$ matrix or so, after that the $\lambda$ :s become zero. But this is not the right thing to do as this is like taking the determinant of the original matrix. And because $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue anymore we will instead of $\lambda$ use $x$ . Another option is to insert the $-x$ into the recurrence instead. Now this gives the sequence of real numbers I am going to ask a question about, but with negative signs. Because I want the sequence to be positive I therefore insert "" $x$ "" into the recurrence which then becomes: $\displaystyle T(n,1)=1, T(1,k)=1, n \geq k: x -\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1} T(n-i,k), n<k: x -\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1} T(k-i,n)$ This then gives a matrix that starts as this $6$ x $6$ determinant equal to zero: $$\begin{vmatrix}1&1&1&1&1&1 \\ 1&-1+x&1&-1+x&1&-1+x \\ 1&1&-2+x&1&1&-2+x \\ 1&-1+x&1&-1&1&-1+x \\ 1&1&1&1&-4+x&1 \\ 1&-1+x&-2+x&-1+x&1&2-2x \end{vmatrix} = 0$$ which results in the equation: $\displaystyle 180 x - 306 x^2 + 184 x^3 - 46 x^4 + 4 x^5 = 0$ for which the $5$ solutions are: $\displaystyle x=0,\; x=3/2,\; x=2,\; x=3,\; x=5$ The polynomials for the $1$ x $1$ to $n$ x $n$ determinants start: $\displaystyle \begin{align*} &1=0\\ &-2+x=0\\ &6-5 x+x^2=0\\ &-6 x+5 x^2-x^3=0\\ &30 x-31 x^2+10 x^3-x^4=0\\ &180 x-306 x^2+184 x^3-46 x^4+4 x^5=0\\ &-1260 x+2322 x^2-1594 x^3+506 x^4-74 x^5+4 x^6=0\\ &1260 x^2-2322 x^3+1594 x^4-506 x^5+74 x^6-4 x^7=0\\ &-2520 x^3+4644 x^4-3188 x^5+1012 x^6-148 x^7+8 x^8=0\\ &-25200 x^3+61560 x^4-59744 x^5+29248 x^6-7552 x^7+968 x^8-48 x^9=0 \end{align*}$ The $n$ :th polynomial appears to have $n-1$ solutions, when counting solutions equal to zero, and $n$ :th polynomial also appears to have those $n-1$ solutions in common with the $n+1$ :th polynomial. This allows us to order the solutions which then become the following infinite sequence $a_n$ starting: $\displaystyle a_n = (), 2,3,0,5,\frac{3}{2},7,0,0,\frac{5}{3},11,0,13,\frac{7}{4},\frac{15}{7},0,17,0,19,0,\frac{7}{3},\frac{11}{6},23,0,0,\frac{13}{7},0,0,29,\frac{15}{11},31...$ The number of distinct primes dividing the number $n$ , $\omega(n)$ , appears to describe this sequence and there are similarities with the Möbius function. But I find it difficult to understand $\dfrac{15}{7}$ , for example.

98,Summing the digits of Pi,Summing the digits of Pi,,"I find $\pi$ and other transcendental numbers quite fascinating.

Consider $\pi$ written in base $10$ , that is, $$ \pi=3.1415926535897932384626433832... $$ Now, let $\pi_i$ be the $i$ th digit of $\pi$ , such that $\pi_1=3$ , $\pi_2=1$ , $\pi_3=4$ and so on. Then, consider the sequence which terms $a_k$ are defined by $$ a_k=\sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{i+1} \pi_i $$ so that, for $k=7$ , for example, we get $$ a_7=3-1+4-1+5-9+2=3. $$ I then plotted the sequence $\{a_k\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ up to $5000$ terms and, surprisingly enough, most of the terms are positive and there are some drastic jumps at specific (and suspiciously periodic) points. I have also computed some further terms in the sequence, including $$ a_{7500}=380,\,\,\,a_{10000}= 181 ,\,\,\,a_{15000}=145,\\ a_{25000}=86,\,\,\,a_{50000}=265,\,\,\, a_{100000}=1694. $$ Well, naturally this is a very random sequence and my humble computer is unable to evaluate a bigger number of terms, so something tells me the randomness of $\pi$ is, in some sense, extended to this sequence. However, I was wondering whether something can be said about the behaviour of such sequence. For instance, would it be reasonable to assume that the different sums will average to $0$ the more terms we consider? What is exactly happening in these initial stages? And beyond that? I guess most of it relies on the density of certain digits along $\pi$ , but also, in a way, on their periodicity. Any ideas? Edit: In the meantime, I was able to plot the sequence for $10^5$ points, so I will leave it here.

I have also computed some further terms in the sequence, including Well, naturally this is a very random sequence and my humble computer is unable to evaluate a bigger number of terms, so something tells me the randomness of is, in some sense, extended to this sequence. However, I was wondering whether something can be said about the behaviour of such sequence. For instance, would it be reasonable to assume that the different sums will average to the more terms we consider? What is exactly happening in these initial stages? And beyond that? I guess most of it relies on the density of certain digits along , but also, in a way, on their periodicity. Any ideas? Edit: In the meantime, I was able to plot the sequence for points, so I will leave it here. The sequence takes negative values again, around .","\pi \pi \pi 10

99,Divergence of $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a\sin(n)$ for $a>1$ to $0$ or $\infty$,Divergence of  for  to  or,\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a\sin(n) a>1 0 \infty,"Consider the product $$\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} a\sin(n).$$ When $a=1$ , clearly this product diverges to $0$ , as $|{\sin{(n)}}|\le1$ , so the value of the partial products can only decrease or stay the same (and they will only decrease if $n\in \mathbb{N}$ ). However, the divergence to 0 or infinity of this product becomes much more complex if $a>1$ . The question of divergence to $0$ is certainly not intuitive, as when $\sin(n)\approx0,$ the partial product will drop significantly, but when $|\sin(n)|>{1\over{a}}$ the partial product will grow (and this happens frequently for large enough $a$ ). What seems to happen is that, for $a\le2$ the partial sums chaotically grow, before eventually divergine to $0$ . For example, $\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{307} 2\sin(n)\approx1402$ , but $\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^{5000} 2\sin(n)\approx 4.8\times10^{-13}$ . When I ask Mathematica about the infinite product when, it rather quickly claims that the product does not converge for any $a$ (I do not know whether this also means it does not diverge to 0). Numerical evidence seems to suggest divergence to $0$ otherwise for $a\le2$ . For $a>2$ , it seems to fairly quickly diverge to infinity. $a=2$ is probably the most interesting case, as approximately $50$ % of the time it should grow, since $0<|\sin(n)|<1$ and the partial product grows iff $|\sin(n)|>1/2$ . Is it known whether this product diverges to $0$ for even one example of $a$ where $1<a\le2$ ? And if $a=2$ ? If it doesn't necessarily diverge to $0$ , does it remain bounded?
