One of the essential properties of a car is its current speed.  Or speed at a current time.  For example, at a given point in time in my drive, I could be traveling 40 mph.  But what does that mean ? From my basic algebra classes, I've learned that speed = distance/time.  So if I travel ten miles in half an hour, my average speed would be $20$ mph ($\frac{10 mi}{25 h}$). But instantaneous velocity...you aren't measuring average speed for a given amount of time.  You're measuring instantaneous speed over an...instantaneous amount of time. That would be something like (miles) / (time), where time = $0$?  Isn't that infinite? And perhaps, in a difference of time = $0$, then I'd be travelling $0$ miles.  So would I be said to be going $0$ mph at an instantaneous moment in time?  I'd like to be able to tell that to any cops pull me over for ""speeding""!

(x+m)} dx ,"Below is a problem from the book ""Calculus and Analytic Geometry"" by Thomas Finney. I am hoping somebody can check my work. I consider it to be a particular hard problem. Thanks, Bob Problem: We dare you to evaluate this integral. $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) ... (x+m)} \,\, dx $$ Answer: To evaluate this integral, we will consider some special cases. For $m = 0$ we have: \begin{align*}  \int \frac{1}{x} \,\, dx &= \ln|x| + C \\ \end{align*} Now for $m = 1$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} \\ 1 &= A(x+1) + B(x) \\ \end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)$ which yields $A = 1$ . \begin{align*} A + B &=  0 \\ 1 + B &= 0 \\ B &= -1 \\ \frac{1}{x(x+1)} &= \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1}  \\ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \,\, dx &=  \ln|x| -  \ln|x+1| + C \\ \end{align*} Now for $m = 2$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} \\ 1 &= A(x+1)(x+2) + B(x)(x+2) + C(x)(x+1) \\ \end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)$ which yields $A = \frac{1}{2}$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2) = -B$ which yields $B = -1$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1) = 2C$ which yields $C = \frac{1}{2}$ . \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} &= \frac{ \frac{1}{2}}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{ \frac{1}{2}}{x+2} \\ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} \,\, dx &= \frac{1}{2} \ln{|x|} - \ln{|x+1|} + \frac{1}{2} \ln{|x+2|} + C \\ \end{align*} Now for $m = 3$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} + \frac{D}{x+3} \\ 1 &= A(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) + B(x)(x+2)(x+3) + \\  & C(x)(x+1)(x+3) + D(x)(x+1)(x+2) \\ \end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)(0+3) = 6A$ which yields $A = 1/6$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2)(-1+3) = -2B$ which yields $B = -1/2$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3) = 2C$ which yields $C = 1/2$ . At $x = -3$ we have $1 = D(-3)(-3+1)(-3+2) = -6D$ which yields $D = -1/6$ . Hence, we have the following solution: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} \,\, dx = \frac{1}{6}\ln{|x|} - \frac{1}{2}\ln{|x+1|} + \frac{1}{2}\ln{|x+2|} - \frac{1}{6}\ln{|x+3|} + C $$ Now for $m = 4$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} + \frac{D}{x+3} + \frac{E}{x+4} \\ 1 &= A(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) \\   &+ B(x)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) \\   &+ C(x)(x+1)(x+3)(x+4) \\   &+ D(x)(x+1)(x+2)(x+4)  \\   &+ E(x)(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) \\ \end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)(0+3)(0+4) = 24A$ which yields $A = 1/24$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2)(-1+3)(-1+4) = -6B$ which yields $B=-1/6$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3)(-2+4) = 4C$ which yields $C = 1/4$ . At $x = -3$ we have $1 = D(-3)(-3+1)(-3+2)(-3+4) = -6D$ which yields $D=-1/6$ . At $x = -4$ we have $1 = E(-4)(-4+1)(-4+2)(-4+3) = 24E$ which yields $E=1/24$ . Hence we have the solution: Now for $m = 4$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} \,\, dx  = \frac{\ln{|x|} - 4\ln{|x+1|} + 6\ln{|x+2|} - 4\ln{|x+3|} + \ln{|x+4|}}{24} + C $$ Now let's consider the general case. \begin{align*} \frac{1}{x(x+1) \cdots (x+m)} \,\, &= \frac{C_0}{x} + \frac{C_1}{x+1} \cdots + \frac{C_m}{x+m} \\  \end{align*} \begin{align*} 1 &= {C_0}(x+1)(x+2) \cdots (x+m) \\   &+ {C_1}(x)(x+2) \cdots (x+m) \\   &+ {C_2}(x)(x+1)(x+3)(x+4) \cdots (x+m) \\   &+ \cdots \\   &+ C_m(x)(x+1)(x+2) \cdots (x+m-1) \\ \end{align*} Now let's consider the first term. We set $x = 0$ and we get: \begin{align*} 1 &= {C_0}(0+1)(0+2) \cdots (x+m) = m! C_0 \\ C_0 &= \frac{1}{m!} \end{align*} Now let's consider the $C_2$ term. We set $x = 2$ and $m > 4$ . We get: \begin{align*} 1 &= C_2(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3)(-2+4)(-2 + 5) \cdots (-2 + m) \\ 1 &= C_2 (2)(1)(2)(3)(4) \cdots (m-2) \\ 1 &= 2(m-2)! C_2 \\ C_2 &= \frac{1}{2(m-2)!} = \frac{m(m-1)}{2(m!)} \\ C_2 &= \frac{ \binom {m}{2} } {m!} \\ \end{align*} Now let's consider the last term. We set $x = -m$ and we get: \begin{align*} 1 &= C_m(-m)(-m+1)(-m+2) \cdots (x+m -1) \\ C_m &= \frac{(-1)^{m}}{m!} \\ \end{align*} Now let's consider one of the middle terms. We set $x = -k$ where $0 <= k <= m$ and we get: \begin{align*} 1 &= C_k(-k)(-k+1)(-k+2) \cdots (-1) (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\  1 &=  {-1}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\ C_k &= \frac{ 1 }{ {(-1)}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1)  } \\ C_k &= \frac{ k! }{ {(-1)}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)m!  } \\ C_k &= \frac{ \binom {m}{k} }{ {(-1)}^k m!  } \\ \end{align*} Hence the answer is: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{k=m} \left( \frac{ \binom {m}{k} }{ {(-1)}^k m!  }\right)  \ln{|x+k|} + C $$","Below is a problem from the book ""Calculus and Analytic Geometry"" by Thomas Finney.

16,Is putting absolute values around the argument of a log obtained through integration incorrect?,Is putting absolute values around the argument of a log obtained through integration incorrect?,,"I've always been taught that when integrating a function of the form $f'(x)/f(x)$ to put an absolute value around the argument of the resulting logarithm.

Furthermore, I thought of a case where this would actually produce the wrong result; $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1{x}\mathrm dx = \log|1| - \log|-1| = 0$$ However, the correct way should be this: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1{x}\mathrm dx = \log(1) - \log(-1) = 0 - i\pi = -i\pi$$ Edit: I may be wrong, but the integral above, ignoring the singularity (sorry couldn't think of a better example to illustrate my point with -1 and changing it now would make people's answers and comments seem off-topic), should be correct due to Euler's identity: $e^{i\pi} = -1 \implies \log(-1) = i\pi$ Could someone please provide a better explanation?

We have $\tan nx=A/B$ where $$A=\binom{n} {1}\tan x-\binom{n}{3}\tan ^3x+\dots$$ and $$B=\binom{n} {0}-\binom{n}{2}\tan ^2x+\dots$$ and thus $$\frac{\tan nx} {n\tan x} =\frac{C} {B} =\dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{B-C}{C}}$$ where $$C=1-\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}\tan^2x+\dots$$ Next $$B-C=-\frac{n^2-1^2}{1!3}\tan^2x+\frac{(n^2-1^2)(n-2)(n-3)}{3!5}\tan^4x-\dots$$ and this can be rewritten as $$-\frac{n^2-1^2}{3}\tan^2x\left(1-\frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2!5}\tan^2x+\dots\right)$$ If the expression in large parentheses above is $D$ then we have $$\frac{\tan nx} {n\tan x} =\dfrac{1}{1-\dfrac{(n^2-1^2) \tan^2x}{3+\dfrac{3C-3D}{D}}}$$ The problem now is to put $B, C, D$ into a common pattern so that we can easily get the next expressions like $E, F, \dots$ .

The problem is that there are many definitions for the sine and cosine function. Let's begin by the classical definition: Classical Definition The sine function is defined as the ratio between the opposite side of the angle, and the hipotenuse of this right triangle. The cosine function is defined as the ratio between the adjacent side of the angle, and the hipotenuse of this right triangle. The tangent function is defined as the ratio between the sine function and the cosine function (with $\cos (x) \neq 0)$ The other trigonometric identities can be proven geometrically for an angle less than or equal $\frac{\pi}{2}rad$ because it's a right triangle. So, we can't prove $\sin(a-b)$ geometrically and then prove $\sin(a+b)$ analytically like I did, because we assumed a negative $b$, something that's not defined geometrically in the right triangle. The identity $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ can be proven with a simple pythagorean theorem in a triangle with hypotenuse 1. The formulas for the sum and difference of sines and cosines can be proven geometrically like in this images I found in this answer : Unit circle definition Imagine a circle centered at the origin of the cartesian plane, then: The sine function for an $x \in R, x>0$ can be defined as the $y$ position of point of the circle where the angle stops if we travel anti-clockwise inside the circle's line. The cosine for an $x \in R, x>0$ function can be defined as the $x$ position of point of the circle where the angle stops if we travel anti-clockwise inside the circle's line. We can make the same definition for negative angles, so for an $x \in R, x<0$ the same holds, but we're know travelling clockwise. The tangent function is defined as the ratio between the sine function and the cosine function (with $\cos (x) \neq 0)$ Then, we can define these functions for all real numbers, since when we travel $2\pi$ we get back to the initial point. So we defined sine and cosine as periodic functions. Open question : How do I prove, with the unit circle periodic definition and without being circular , the $\sin(a-b)$ and $\cos(a-b)$ formulas? (same for $\sin(a+b)$ and $\cos(a+b)$. Taylor Series definition $$\sin x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1}$$ $$\cos x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n}$$ $$\tan x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{B_{2n} (-4)^n (1-4^n)}{(2n)!} x^{2n-1}$$ Here , in the same question, there's an analytic proof of the trigonometric identites, for these sums. What's the best definition for calculus? Well, in calculus we use trigonometric functions a LOT: in integral substitutions, in series, taylor series (like the ones I showed now), derivatives, convergence tests (like the Euler onde in the basel problem) and other things... All the definitions I see, are kinda circular or not rigorous enough to make me feel good taking some derivatives or integral substitution, because I always care about the domain of these things. So I want to define it very nicely and be able to use all the trigonometric identities. I've seen many geometrical proofs of $\sin(a-b)$, $\sin(a+b)$, $\cos(a-b)$, $\cos(a+b)$ using a right triangle and then suddenly the person starts using this formula for all real numbers. I need a complete definition of the trigonometric functions that works periodically and for all reals. The taylor series definition seems good but they're generated using trigonometric identities that are not yet proven (assuming this definition). ps: I know that I used some primitive words in some definitions, like ' travel ' so I let them in emphasis , but I hope you guys understand. And sorry by the long post, but I needed to do it, because I've never seen a complete definition in any book.

Taylor Series definition $$\sin x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1}$$ $$\cos x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n}$$ $$\tan x = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1} \frac{B_{2n} (-4)^n (1-4^n)}{(2n)!} x^{2n-1}$$ Here , in the same question, there's an analytic proof of the trigonometric identites, for these sums. What's the best definition for calculus? Well, in calculus we use trigonometric functions a LOT: in integral substitutions, in series, taylor series (like the ones I showed now), derivatives, convergence tests (like the Euler onde in the basel problem) and other things... All the definitions I see, are kinda circular or not rigorous enough to make me feel good taking some derivatives or integral substitution, because I always care about the domain of these things. So I want to define it very nicely and be able to use all the trigonometric identities. I've seen many geometrical proofs of $\sin(a-b)$, $\sin(a+b)$, $\cos(a-b)$, $\cos(a+b)$ using a right triangle and then suddenly the person starts using this formula for all real numbers. I need a complete definition of the trigonometric functions that works periodically and for all reals. The taylor series definition seems good but they're generated using trigonometric identities that are not yet proven (assuming this definition). ps: I know that I used some primitive words in some definitions, like ' travel ' so I let them in emphasis , but I hope you guys understand. And sorry by the long post, but I needed to do it, because I've never seen a complete definition in any book. Thanks.",,"['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'geometry']"
