Then, $|a\cdot u - a\cdot x| < |a|r$. If $u\in S$, then either $u\in S^{\text{int}}$ or $u\in \delta S$.  ($\delta$ denotes boundary). If $u\in S^{\text{int}}$, then $B(r,x) \subset S$, and $a\cdot u = 0$. But then the inequality becomes $|a|r > 0$ which implies $B(r,x) \subset S \forall r > 0$, but this is impossible since it would also imply that $S = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $S^c$ is empty, which is false.

70,Graph of a continuous function is locally Euclidean,Graph of a continuous function is locally Euclidean,,"I am working through Lee's ""Intro to Topological Manifolds,"" and in the third chapter the subspace topology is introduced. After showing that subspaces of Hausdorff and second-countable spaces are Hausdorff and second-countable, we realize that since $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies both of these conditions, a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ will be a manifold if it is also locally Euclidean; hence, to know if a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a manifold, we need only check that it is locally Euclidean. (A manifold is a Hausdorff, second-countable, locally Euclidean topological space.) A first example is that of a continuous map $f:U\subset \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ , where $U$ open; the claim is that the graph $$ \Gamma\left(f\right) = \left\{ \left(x,f\left(x\right)\right) \, \middle| \, x \in U \right\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+k} $$ is an $n$ -manifold. As mentioned above, it's surely Hausdorff and second-countable. Naturally the homeomorphism between $\Gamma\left(f\right)$ and $U$ that we seek is going to be $$ \Phi \left(x \right) = \left(x,f\left(x\right)\right) $$ and it remains to show that this is, indeed, a homeomorphism. It is certainly a bijection. We can see that $\Phi ^{-1}\left(x,f\left(x\right)\right) = x $ so that $$ \Phi^{-1} = \pi_1|_{\Gamma\left(f\right)}$$ which is the restriction of a continuous map, and is thus continuous. I am struggling to show that $\Phi$ itself is continuous. Note that the author has not yet introduced product topologies , and I am meant to work only with subspaces. The claim is that ""It is continuous because $f$ is,"" and I am trying to prove this. My proof seems much messier than that concise statement suggests. Am I missing something simple here? My proof Let $V\subset \Gamma\left(f\right)$ be open, so $V = W\cap \Gamma\left(f\right)$ with $W\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ by definition of the subspace topology on $\Gamma\left(f\right)$ . We want to show that $\Phi^{-1}\left(V\right)$ is open in $U$ . Let $x \in \Phi^{-1}\left(V\right)$ . Then $\Phi\left(x\right) \in V = W \cap \Gamma\left(f\right)$ , so $\Phi\left(x\right) \in W$ and there exists some ball neighborhood of $\Phi(x) = \left(x,f\left(x\right)\right)$ contained in $W$ , namely $B_1 = B_{\epsilon}\left(\left(x, f\left(x\right)\right)\right) \subset W$ . (I will now show that there is a neighborhood of $x$ contained in $\Phi^{-1}\left(V\right)$ that maps within $B_1$ , proving the openness of the former and thus continuity of $\Phi$ . This will utilize continuity of $f$ and properties of the Euclidean metric.) Since $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ is continuous, there is a $\delta' >0$ such that $$d\left(x', x\right) < \delta' \implies d\left(f\left(x'\right), f\left(x\right)\right) < \epsilon / \sqrt{2}, $$ where the $d$ indicate the metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^k$ respectively. Then let $\delta = \min \left\{\delta', \epsilon/\sqrt{2}\right\}$ . Then if $   d\left(x', x\right) < \delta$ , we have $$ d\left(\left(x', f\left(x'\right)\right), \left(x, f\left(x\right)\right) \right)^2 = d\left(x', x\right)^2 + d\left(f\left(x'\right), f\left(x\right)\right)^2 < \left(\frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \epsilon^2 $$ which says that $$ d\left(\Phi\left(x'\right), \Phi\left(x\right)\right) < \epsilon $$ and so we have shown that $$x' \in B_{\delta}\left(x\right) \implies \Phi\left(x'\right) \in B_1. $$ Since $\Phi\left(x'\right) \in \Gamma\left(f\right)$ obviously, we have further that $$x' \in B_{\delta}\left(x\right) \implies \Phi\left(x'\right) \in B_1 \cap \Gamma\left(f\right) \subset W\cap \Gamma\left(f\right) = V. $$ Hence, $B_{\delta}\left(x\right)$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ in $\Phi^{-1}\left(V\right)$ that maps inside of $V$ , so $\Phi^{-1}\left(V\right)$ is open and $\Phi$ is continuous. $\blacksquare$","I am working through Lee's ""Intro to Topological Manifolds,"" and in the third chapter the subspace topology is introduced.

For the $[0, 1]$ result, there's also some nice discussion in Why are the integers with the cofinite topology not path-connected? ] Proof . Suppose not: then take just the nonempty closed sets, and the partition has size at least two. If the partition is finite, it disconnects $I = [0, 1]$ . So the partition is countably infinite, say $(A_i)_0^\infty$ . We'll get a contradiction by constructing a point of $I$ which is not in $\bigcup A_i$ , by building a decreasing sequence of open intervals which stay away from the $A_i$ . For any $j$ , take $B_j$ = $\bigcup_{i = 0}^j A_j$ . $B_j$ is a closed proper subset of $I$ . Get $j_0$ with $0, 1 \in B_{j_0}$ , and get $x_0 \in I - B_{j_0}$ . Since $B_{j_0}$ is closed, there's an open interval $(t, u)$ disjoint from $B_{j_0}$ with $x_0 \in (t, u)$ . Take $p_0$ to be the $\inf$ of all such $t$ , and $q_0$ to be the $\sup$ of all such $u$ : then $(p_0, q_0)$ is still disjoint from $B_{j_0}$ . Note that $p_0 \in B_{j_0}$ : otherwise $p_0$ has a neighborhood disjoint from $B_{j_0}$ and $p_0$ would not be minimal. Similarly, $q_0 \in B_{j_0}$ . Take the smallest index $j'_0$ such that $A_{j'_0}$ meets $(p_0, q_0)$ (note that $j'_0 > j_0$ ). I claim there is some $u \in (p_0, q_0)$ with $(p_0, u)$ disjoint from $A_{j'_0}$ : otherwise there's a sequence $u_k \to p_0$ with all $u_k$ in $A_{j'_0}$ , which is impossible since $A_{j'_0}$ is closed and does not contain $p_0$ . Take $q_1$ to be the $\sup$ of all such $u$ : then $(p_0, q_1)$ is disjoint from $A_{j'_0}$ and $q_1 \in A_{j'_0}$ as above. In fact $(p_0, q_1)$ is disjoint from $B_{j'_0}$ , because $j'_0$ is minimal. Similarly, on the other side, take the smallest $j_1$ such that $A_{j_1}$ meets $(p_0, q_1)$ , and take $p_1$ to be the $\inf$ of all $t \in (p_0, q_1)$ such that $(t, q_1)$ is disjoint from $A_{j_1}$ . Now $j_1 > j_0$ , $p_0 < p_1 < q_1 < q_0$ , $(p_1, q_1)$ is disjoint from $B_{j_1}$ , and $p_1, q_1 \in B_{j_1}$ . Repeat this to get $j'_1$ and $q_2$ , and $j_2$ and $p_2$ , with $p_1 < p_2 < q_2 < q_1$ , $(p_2, q_2)$ disjoint from $B_{j_2}$ , and $j_2 > j_1$ . Continue inductively to get $j_i$ and $(p_i, q_i)$ for all $i$ . The sequence $(j_i)$ approaches infinity, so $\bigcup B_{j_i} = I$ . $(p_i)$ is increasing and $(q_i)$ is decreasing. Taking $p = \sup {p_i}$ and $q = \inf {q_i}$ , we have $p \le q$ , when means $p$ is in all the $(p_i, q_i)$ . But then $p$ is in none of the $B_{j_i}$ , which is impossible.

For a sample, see the various references mentioned in this question .  See also the discussion here and here for example. One starts with a topological space $(X,T)$ , where $T$ is the topology.  Sometimes some separation condition (like weak-Hausdorff, etc) is added to the definition, sometimes not, but we'll ignore that part here.  What all the definitions have in common is that one takes the final topology on $X$ with respect to some family of continuous maps into $X$ .  One can either take all the inclusion maps from certain subspaces, or all the continuous maps from arbitrary spaces of a certain kind.  And on the other hand, one can take the domains of these maps to be compact, or compact Hausdorff.  That gives a total of four combinations.  I am trying to unravel things and understand the relationships between these four possible definitions, spelled out explicitly below. In each case, one starts with an appropriate family $\mathcal F$ of continuous functions into $X$ and one forms the final topology on $X$ with respect to $\mathcal F$ .  That topology is called the k-ification of $(X,T)$ , denoted $T_{\mathcal F}$ .  The space $X$ is then called a $k$ -space or compactly generated if its topology coincides with its k-ification.  So here are the four possibilities with separate names for the purpose of discussion: (1) CGSub: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all inclusions from compact subspaces of $X$ .  The corresponding definition of compactly generated space is the one in wikipedia . (2) CG: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary compact spaces. (3) HCGSub: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all inclusions from compact Hausdorff subspaces of $X$ .  The wikipedia article calls the corresponding spaces ""Hausdorff-compactly generated"". (4) HCG: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces.  This is the definition in nlab and is the one more commonly used in algebraic topology. Note that for CG and HCG, the families of maps are not sets but proper classes.  The final topology is still perfectly well-defined, as explained here . To understand the relationships between the various k-ifications, the following is useful. Lemma 1: Let $X$ be a set, $\mathcal F$ a family of functions from topological spaces to $X$ , and $\mathcal G$ a subfamily of $\mathcal F$ .  Then the respective final topologies satisfy $T_{\mathcal F}\subseteq T_{\mathcal G}$ . This implies these relationships between the k-ifications: $T_{CG}\subseteq T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}$ $T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}$ Now combine this with Lemma 2: Suppose $(X,T)$ is a topological space and $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal G$ are two families of continuous functions from topological spaces to $X$ .  If each $f:Y\to X$ in $\mathcal F$ factors through an element $g:Z\to X$ in $\mathcal G$ (via some continuous function $Y\to Z$ ), then $T_{\mathcal G}\subseteq T_{\mathcal F}$ . We can apply this to CG and CGSub.  Each continuous function in CG, namely $f:C\to X$ from a compact space $C$ , has compact image and factors through the inclusion $f(C)\to X$ in CGSub.  So $T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{CG}$ . Combining this with the previous inclusions gives this relationship between a topology and its k-ifications: $$T\subseteq T_{CGSub}=T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}.$$ And for the corresponding definitions of spaces, $X$ is CGSub if $T=T_{CGSub}$ , etc.  So the relationships between the various definitions of space properties are: $$HCGSub\implies HCG\implies CG \iff CGSub.$$ In particular, ""nlab compactly generated"" (HCG) implies ""wikipedia compactly generated"" (CGSub).  And for the wikipedia definition, it does not matter if it is defined via subspaces (CGSub) or via maps from arbitrary spaces (CG). The implication HCG $\implies$ CGSub cannot be reversed.  For example, as explained in this question , the one-point compactification of a space which is not CGSub (like the Arens-Fort space) is CGSub but not HCG (because HCG is preserved by open subspaces, but that's not the case in the example). Also note: if $X$ is Hausdorff, all notions above coincide. Apart from validating the above, I would be interested if anyone could point to a reference that ""nlab definition"" implies ""wikipedia definition"". Specific question: Can the implication HCGSub $\implies$ HCG be reversed?  In general a continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space does not seem to factor through an inclusion of a compact Hausdorff subspace of the codomain.  So my guess would be no.  But what would be an example of a HCG space that is not HCGSub?  A compact example would be even better. Minor question: HCGSub is called ""Hausdorff-compactly generated"" in wikipedia (note the hyphen!).  That name seems very dubious.  Never heard of it anywhere.  Maybe someone can comment on that.  Maybe for categorical reasons HCGSub is not a very useful notion compared with HCG, for uses in algebraic topology in particular?","There are multiple (incompatible) definitions of ""compactly generated"" or "" -space"" in the literature.

Combining this with the previous inclusions gives this relationship between a topology and its k-ifications: And for the corresponding definitions of spaces, is CGSub if , etc.  So the relationships between the various definitions of space properties are: In particular, ""nlab compactly generated"" (HCG) implies ""wikipedia compactly generated"" (CGSub).  And for the wikipedia definition, it does not matter if it is defined via subspaces (CGSub) or via maps from arbitrary spaces (CG). The implication HCG CGSub cannot be reversed.  For example, as explained in this question , the one-point compactification of a space which is not CGSub (like the Arens-Fort space) is CGSub but not HCG (because HCG is preserved by open subspaces, but that's not the case in the example). Also note: if is Hausdorff, all notions above coincide. Apart from validating the above, I would be interested if anyone could point to a reference that ""nlab definition"" implies ""wikipedia definition"". Specific question: Can the implication HCGSub HCG be reversed?  In general a continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space does not seem to factor through an inclusion of a compact Hausdorff subspace of the codomain.  So my guess would be no.  But what would be an example of a HCG space that is not HCGSub?  A compact example would be even better. Minor question: HCGSub is called ""Hausdorff-compactly generated"" in wikipedia (note the hyphen!).  That name seems very dubious.  Never heard of it anywhere.  Maybe someone can comment on that.  Maybe for categorical reasons HCGSub is not a very useful notion compared with HCG, for uses in algebraic topology in particular?","k (X,T) T X X \mathcal F X X \mathcal F (X,T) T_{\mathcal F} X k \mathcal F= X \mathcal F= \mathcal F= X \mathcal F= X \mathcal F X \mathcal G \mathcal F T_{\mathcal F}\subseteq T_{\mathcal G} T_{CG}\subseteq T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{HCGSub} T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub} (X,T) \mathcal F \mathcal G X f:Y\to X \mathcal F g:Z\to X \mathcal G Y\to Z T_{\mathcal G}\subseteq T_{\mathcal F} f:C\to X C f(C)\to X T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{CG} T\subseteq T_{CGSub}=T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}.
