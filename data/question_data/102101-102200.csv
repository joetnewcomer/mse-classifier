4,Geometric/visual interpretation of transitivity for equivalence relations on $\mathbb{R}$,Geometric/visual interpretation of transitivity for equivalence relations on,\mathbb{R},"If we graph equivalence relations on $\mathbb{R}$ on the plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, the properties of reflexivity and symmetry give rise to certain geometric properties--i.e. reflexivity means the line $y = x$ must be included, and symmetry means the graph must be symmetric about this line. However, for transitivity, it being defined in terms of three different points, it's harder for me to pin down a visual interpretation in this regard. In some sense, the structures formed seem to be ""square-like"" (for example, the graph of the smallest equivalence relation containing the set $$S = \{(x,y)\,|\,(y = x + 1) \wedge (0 < x < 2)\},$$ this example being from Ch. 1, Section 3, Exercise 5 of Munkres' Topology , for reference).

Algorithms like these are called "" greedy algorithms ,"" and while they do not guarantee optimal solutions, they tend to give good approximations when the fitness landscape is sufficiently nice. Now, I would like to prove that this algorithm is ""justified"" (not correct - it's not! - justified ), i.e. that for a minimal $U$, each disk must be tangential to at least one other disk .

I am thinking along the lines of ""show that if there is an optimal solution where one disk is not tangential to another disk, then the solution can be improved by making it so.""

Of course, you'll say, this is only because the arrangement is not optimal in the first place; but then again, we only know this intuitively, so we're back to square one. My other thought is to use induction, but this brings us back to the problem of the greedy algorithm: a solution for $n$ says nothing about the solution for $n+1$. I am well aware that circle packing problems are in general very hard; in fact, exact solutions only exist for very small $n$.

18,Deriving an implicit Cartesian equation from a polar equation with fractional multiples of the angle,Deriving an implicit Cartesian equation from a polar equation with fractional multiples of the angle,,"Usually, applying the conversion formulae $r^2=x^2+y^2$ $\cos\;\theta=\frac{x}{r}$ $\sin\;\theta=\frac{y}{r}$ to transform an equation in polar coordinates to an implicit Cartesian equation is quite straightforward for an equation of the form $r=f(\cos(n\theta),\sin(n\theta))$ with $n$ an integer, thanks to multiple angle formulae. Polar equations of the form $r=f\left(\cos\left(\frac{p}{q}\theta\right),\sin\left(\frac{r}{s}\theta\right)\right)$ where $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$ are integers, and $\frac{p}{q}$ and $\frac{r}{s}$ are in lowest terms, are more difficult to handle, but the case where $q$, $s$ are powers of 2 is slightly eased by the existence of identities like $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)=\frac{\sin\;\theta}{1+\cos\;\theta}$. The really difficult ones to handle are the cases like Cayley's sextic : $r=4a\cos^3\left(\frac{\theta}{3}\right)$ and in general, the cases with fractions whose denominators are not powers of 2. In particular for Cayley's sextic, I can't seem to find a quick way to exploit the appropriate multiple angle identities. One ""cheat"" I have seen is to instead represent the polar equation as a pair of parametric equations, and then make the substitution $\theta=3\arctan\;t$ so that everything is represented algebraically. The problem is that apparently it takes some insight to recognize how to remove the new parameter $t$ easily. For even tougher cases like $r=\cos\left(\frac{2\theta}{3}\right)-\sin\left(\frac{3\theta}{5}\right)$ the appropriate substitution after transforming to parametric equations is $\theta=\mathrm{LCM}(3,5)\arctan\;t$, but the expressions, though algebraic, look even more nightmare-ish to manipulate. Mathematica has no trouble figuring out the implicit Cartesian equation, through a judicious use of Gröbner bases: Factor /@ GroebnerBasis[Append[Thread[{x, y} == TrigExpand[{4a Cos[t/3]^3 Cos[t], 4a Cos[t/3]^3 Sin[t]}]], Cos[t/3]^2 + Sin[t/3]^2 == 1], {x, y}, {Cos[t/3], Sin[t/3]}, MonomialOrder -> EliminationOrder] but I'm pretty sure the Cartesian equations have already been determined way before Buchberger was born.

First, I have never done a proof before, sorry I am so poor here. I have spent many hours but my actions have mostly used wrong ideas. I will only say what I have done that I think is right. If you need my other writing I can write it out but it was mostly about fitting shapes inside the triangles and I think the big mistake is that if the equal statement $a^2+b^2=c^2$ were to be wrong then anything about the inside triangles cannot prove the statement to be wrong because  the algebra is connected to the geometry of the triangle and the shapes are inside the geometry of the triangle. Start: I started by drawing a square with sides $d,e,f,g$ all the same as a.  The biggest possible right triangle has two sides the same length. This square can fit at least two right triangles inside it both no smaller than the other with one side equal to a. That is true because if you made one smaller than the other and pushed it into one corner of the square then the bigger triangle touching it would overlap the corners of the square which is wrong. So then the sum $d+e+f+g=4a$ is more than $a+b+c$ where $a,b,c$ are the side lengths of one of the triangles and $4a>a+b+c$. Then I square $$\begin{eqnarray*} 16a^2&>& (a+b+c)^2\\ &=&a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ac)\\ \end{eqnarray*}$$ The only thing I can do here is use the equation at the top so if $a^2+b^2=c^2$ isn’t true for the triangle then it’s $a^2+b^2=c^2+z$ for some $z$. But I subtracted that from the expression and it wasn’t wrong which I thought it would have to be since I added the $z$. I guess the extra $z$ can’t show the equation is wrong since any number could be equal to it including those like zero which it is not really equal to atleast if the equation were wrong. But if there is a rule that $z$ isn’t zero included somehow there should be a way to conclude having $z$ not be zero is wrong. But then I checked and found $a,b,c,z$ with $z$ not zero so that the inequality holds so I’m very confused. Maybe the squares are too simple and I should have chosen a rectangle or put squares around the outside of the triangle. I know a book that proves this but I want just some clues whether my actions are appropriate to solving this and otherwise a clue for a new way since I don’t care about it for a class I just like to think about the question. Edit. I have corrected (a+b+c)^2 I think. I am also grateful for the answer below which gives a good clue and just as much as I wished for. It is certainly an interesting choice of shapes and different from what I was doing in that there are no gaps between the shapes. It helps clarify that as I am asking about ways that work I am also asking if an approach using gaps between shapes and estimations rather than exactness could work as an approach (perhaps just because I have spent some hours and wish to recover some value). Is that known? Or perhaps the notion of grouping proofs into approaches is just because the mind is simple and we can't talk about the correctness of approaches only whether one proof we are handed is right or wrong.","Proving $a^2+b^2=c^2$ where $a,b,c$ are side lengths of a right triangle.

Possible values of the largest radius?",,"The bounty expires in 9 hours . Answers to this question are eligible for a +50 reputation bounty. Dan wants to draw more attention to this question. Consider four circles with integer radii inscribed in a triangle as shown. That is, a circle with integer radius $R$ is inscribed in a triangle, and three other circles with integer radii $a,b,c$ are each tangent to the large circle and two sides of the triangle. Given an arbitrary positive integer, how can we determine if it is a possible value of $R$ ? (As an analogy, here is a similar question, and its answer: Given an arbitrary positive integer, how can we determine if it is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer side lengths? The answer is by checking if it has a prime factor of the form $4k+1$ .) My attempt It turns out that $R=\sqrt{ab}+\sqrt{bc}+\sqrt{ac}$ . So we require $R=\sqrt{ab}+\sqrt{bc}+\sqrt{ac}$ and $R>\max(a,b,c)$ where $R, a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z^+}$ . If we temporarily relax the requirement that $R>\max(a,b,c)$ , then it can be shown that $R$ can be any positive integer except $1,2,4$ , as follows (but I'm not sure if this is useful). $R$ can be any odd number greater than $1$ , because if $a=1,\space b=1,\space c=n^2$ , then $R=2n+1$ . As @Zoe Allen noted in the comments, if $a,b,c$ give $R$ , then $2a,2b,2c$ give $2R$ , so $R$ can be $2^k(2n+1)$ , so it only remains to consider the powers of $2$ . As @John Omielan noted, if $a=1,\space b=4,\space c=4$ then $R=8$ , so $R$ can be any power of $2$ larger than $4$ . Clearly $R$ cannot equal $2$ . It is easy to show that $R$ cannot equal $4$ (if $R\le 4$ then at least two of $a,b,c,$ must equal $1$ , but then the third cannot make $R=4$ ). So $R$ can be any positive integer except $1,2,4$ . But with the requirement that $R>\max(a,b,c)$ , there are many other numbers that cannot be $R$ values. As @Will Jagy noted, the numbers below $100$ that cannot be $R$ values are $1,2,4,7,13,14,17,23,28,34,37,43,46,49,53,67,73,97,98$ .

Question: Consider a bounded region in the Euclidean plane, in this case, we will consider the unit square $[0, 1]\times[0, 1]$. We will place $n$ points inside it. Next, we find the shortest path that passes through all $n$ points. Where do we place the $n$ points such that the length of this shortest path is maximised? Examples: For $n=2$, we have the longest path as a diagonal of the square, with length $\sqrt{2}$: For $n=3$, (credit to Fritz for spotting this error) we have this longest path part of the largest equilateral triangle in the square, of length $\frac{8}{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}$: Placing 4 points at the corners of the square will lead to this path, which I suspect is the longest, with length $3$: Some work: The maximum length path is $\omega(\sqrt{n})$. A construction: Arrange the $n$ points into a regular grid formation. Since the points are separated by a distance $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ and there are $n$ points, multiplying them gives the bound of $\omega(\sqrt{n})$ Placing the points at $\left(\frac{i}{\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil}, \frac{j}{\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil}\right)$ would give a closed-form lower bound for the upper bound of $\frac{n-1}{\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil}$.

Ideally, I'm actually looking for a slightly different ratio (which is explained below), but this is the basic problem I believe that needs to solved. Only the isosceles triangle $\triangle ABC$ may be used as input  (the image is slightly misleading, as they all should be straight lines and $\overline DF$ should be slightly higher than $\triangle ABC$ and not intersecting it). The actual problem I'm trying to solve is to subdivide a dodecahedron into smaller faces (known as a chamfered dodecahedron), and approximate a sphere using that polyhedron. This is done in 3 steps: Scale down each face from its center by some scale factor (what I'm trying to solve for) so that the hexagons constructed in the next step are planar (they will not be equiangular, however) Construct hexagons in between the newly subdivided faces (goldberg polyhedrons will always have 12 pentagons, no matter how subdivided they are) Scale the new face from the origin so that each vertex has the same magnitude of the original face (this is done by normalizing each vertex, then scaling by a specified radius - this will make the hexagons non-planar) My problem is that I'm stuck on how to identify how to scale factor in the first step, as there doesn't seem to be a linear relationship between the scale factor needed and the number of subdivisions that are performed. This is shown in the two images below, where I'm adding the new faces over the original dodecahedron (radius of 1 in my case). I manually calculated approximately $0.40706$ (or $40.706\%$ ) for the first subdivision, which allowed the construction of the [green] hexagon to have satisfyingly equivalent sides. However, when I tried scaling the new pentagons again with the same scale factor (shown with the yellow pentagons), the hexagons in-between were not equilateral... I suspect that the scale factor will change the more I subdivide these faces - indicating that there must be a non-linear relationship between side length and the length of the connecting chord. To attempt to solve my problem, I reconstructed the issue to what I hope is a solvable math problem, shown in the images below (although lines $\overline {AB}$ and $\overline {BC}$ should be chords, not arcs - thanks to @Blue in the comments). However, I frankly have no idea where to start... I feel like solving this problem is beyond my knowledge. I then tried condensing this to a simpler case with an isosceles triangle in 2D space, but I encountered a similar block as well.

I would be very grateful for your guidance on this issue!

This is done in 3 steps: Scale down each face from its center by some scale factor (what I'm trying to solve for) so that the hexagons constructed in the next step are planar (they will not be equiangular, however) Construct hexagons in between the newly subdivided faces (goldberg polyhedrons will always have 12 pentagons, no matter how subdivided they are) Scale the new face from the origin so that each vertex has the same magnitude of the original face (this is done by normalizing each vertex, then scaling by a specified radius - this will make the hexagons non-planar) My problem is that I'm stuck on how to identify how to scale factor in the first step, as there doesn't seem to be a linear relationship between the scale factor needed and the number of subdivisions that are performed. This is shown in the two images below, where I'm adding the new faces over the original dodecahedron (radius of 1 in my case). I manually calculated approximately (or ) for the first subdivision, which allowed the construction of the [green] hexagon to have satisfyingly equivalent sides. However, when I tried scaling the new pentagons again with the same scale factor (shown with the yellow pentagons), the hexagons in-between were not equilateral... I suspect that the scale factor will change the more I subdivide these faces - indicating that there must be a non-linear relationship between side length and the length of the connecting chord. To attempt to solve my problem, I reconstructed the issue to what I hope is a solvable math problem, shown in the images below (although lines and should be chords, not arcs - thanks to @Blue in the comments). However, I frankly have no idea where to start... I feel like solving this problem is beyond my knowledge. I then tried condensing this to a simpler case with an isosceles triangle in 2D space, but I encountered a similar block as well. I know that I need ""scale"" as the output (specifically when scale was used in the first step), and my known values are the pentagon/hexagon side lengths, its position in 3D space, and the magnitude of each of the points. I would be very grateful for your guidance on this issue! Edit: This is the result I'm trying to achieve, using the following manually approximated scale factors (note that the hexagons are not planar): Subdivision | Pentagons | Hexagons  ------------|-----------|---------      0      |     -     |    -         1      |  0.40706  |    -         2      |  0.44950  |  0.4874       3      |    ...    |   ...",\overline {DF} |\overline {AD}| = |\overline {DF}| |\overline {AC}| |\overline {DF}| \triangle ABC \overline DF \triangle ABC 0.40706 40.706\% \overline {AB} \overline {BC},"['geometry', 'triangles', '3d', 'spheres', 'polyhedra']"

90,Convex geometric realizability of abstract polyhedron with congruent isosceles obtuse triangular faces,Convex geometric realizability of abstract polyhedron with congruent isosceles obtuse triangular faces,,"Question below. Some background: Take an isosceles obtuse triangle of the form with $\alpha = \frac{n-1}{n}\pi$ for some $n \geq 3$ ( $\beta=\frac{\pi}{2n}$ ) If you look at the class of convex polyhedra such that each face is congruent to this triangle, then the vertices are of the following types: $\alpha^2\beta^2$ $\beta^4$ , $\beta^6$ , ..., $\beta^{4n-2}$ $\alpha\beta^{2n}$ A type indicates which face angles go around it. Lets look at what happens if such a polyhedron has a vertex of type $\beta^m$ ( $m=4,6, ..., 4n-2$ ): The vertices colored red, only allow for the type $\alpha^2\beta^2$ and so they can be filled in. The next picture shows this: where lines that are marked similarly should be pasted together. This can be done in all vertices colored red, obtaining This fixes thus a unique abstract polyhedron $P_m$ . Abstract here also fixes the face angles and the edge lengths (up to scale). This shape (if it is geometrically realizable) somewhat resembles a trapezohedron where the faces are bent on the long diagonal. Which of the $P_m$ is geometrically realizable as a convex polyhedron? (we do not allow edges with dihedral angle $\pi$ ) And how would you prove this? After trying out with some paper models, it seems that the only polyhedron that is geometrically realizable is $P_4$ . I can prove that $P_6$ is never geometrically realizable as a convex polyhedron $Q$ : Any net of $Q$ can be folded to a parallelepiped with kite faces (angles $\alpha$ , $2\beta$ , $\alpha$ , $2\beta$ ). By Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem , this means that $Q$ is a parallelepiped; and thus has dihedral angles $\pi$ (two triangles joined together with their long edge form a face of this parallelepiped) At first I thought I could extend this proof to $m > 6$ by showing that the net folds to a trapezohedron, but proving this is much harder than in case of the parallelepiped; because now we have to show that there exists a geometrically realizable trapezohedron with all faces congruent to a kite with angles $\alpha, 2\beta, \alpha, 2\beta$ . Moreover, it might be that this is not the case; which means we have to find another way to prove this. Question : How to prove that $P_m$ is not geometrically realizable as a convex polyhedron for $m > 6$ ? How to prove that $P_4$ is geometrically realizable as a convex polyhedron? Which general techniques exist for proving similar results? I would prefer answers that do not use coordinate calculations. Results that I think could help: Lemma 2a p 162 of Convex Polyhedra If two convex polyhedral angles, distinct from dihedral angles and possibly degenerate, have corresponding planar angles of equal measure while not all of their dihedral angles are equal, then there are at least four sign changes in the differences between the corresponding dihedral angles as we go around the vertices. This can be used to find minimal and maximal dihedral angles. For example, in a $\alpha^2\beta^2$ vertex, if we set the dihedral angle between the two $\beta$ to $\pi$ ; this is still realizable. This angle should decrease. Therefore the opposite angle has to decrease as well; which shows that the dihedral angle between the two $\alpha$ reaches its maximum when the dihedral angle between the two $\beta$ is $\pi$ . This dihedral angle $A$ satisfies the following formula : $\cos(A) = \frac{\cos(2\beta) - \cos^2(\alpha)}{\sin^2(\alpha)} = \frac{-\cos(\alpha) - \cos^2(\alpha)}{\sin^2(\alpha)}$ This question is part of a search to classify the convex polyhedra with congruent isosceles triangular faces (the faces do not need to be transitive).","Question below.

Indeed, with reference to the picture at the bottom, we can see that we must have $$\theta = \frac{2 \pi} n = 2 \arctan \left( \frac r {\sqrt{R^2+2 R r}} \right)$$ from which $$n = \left \lfloor \frac \pi {\arctan \left( \frac r {\sqrt{R^2+2 R r}} \right)}\right \rfloor$$ The last expression gives the correct result for $R=r$, namely $n=6$ (hexagonal lattice). Moreover, when $R \gg r$, we get $$n \simeq \left \lfloor \frac {\pi R}  {r}\right \rfloor$$ which is completely reasonable. How can I tackle the same problem in the 3D case (spheres)? It is clear that for  $R \gg r$ we must get $$n \simeq \left \lfloor \frac {4 \pi R^2}  {\pi r^2}\right \rfloor$$ and also that we must have $n(R=r)=12$. Any hint/suggestion is appreciated.","It is well known that, given a sphere, the maximum number of identical spheres that we can pack around it is exactly 12, corresponding to a face centered cubic or hexagonal close packed lattice.
