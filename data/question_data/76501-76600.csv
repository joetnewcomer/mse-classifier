1,Sequential compactness and filters,Sequential compactness and filters,,"I'm trying to work with the many equivalent definitions of compactness for a topological space $X$ ; in particular, Every (proper) filter on $X$ has a (proper) convergent refinement. I'll be referring to this property as filter-compactness for convenience, and also because it looks very much like sequential compactness. *Edit to include some other definitions here: A filter on $X$ is said to be proper if it does not have the empty set as a member. Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a filter on $X$ . If $\mathcal{G}$ is another filter on $X$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{G}$ , then $\mathcal{G}$ is said to be a refinement of $\mathcal{F}$ . A filter $\mathcal{F}$ on a topological space $X$ is convergent if there exists $x \in X$ such that $\mathcal{F}$ refines the neighbourhood filter $N_x$ of $x$ , which is defined by $$ N_x = \{\, A \subseteq X \mid A \text{ contains an open neighbourhood of $x$ in $X$}\, \} $$ It is clear to me that filter-compactness and sequential compactness are equivalent for metric spaces because both are equivalent to open-set compactness. However, I'm hoping for a direct proof, since the two definitions seem so similar. Here's what I've managed: Let $X$ be a metric space and suppose that $X$ is filter-compact. Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $X$ , and let $\mathcal{F}$ denote the elementary filter associated with $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ , which is defined by $$\mathcal{F} = \{\, A \subseteq X \mid A \text{ contains all but finitely many of the } x_n\, \}.$$ Since $X$ is filter-compact, there is a convergent refinement $\mathcal{G}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ . It'd be good if $\mathcal{G}$ were the elementary filter associated with some subsequence. But that doesn't seem to be true in general, considering refinements can be very large. I'm not able to get anything for the converse either. Following notation used in Eric's answer: Replace the sets $A_n \in \mathcal{G}$ by their closures in $X$ . There exists $r > 0$ such that the open ball $B(x, r)$ is a subset of $A$ . Since $d(A_n) \to 0$ , we have $d(\bigcap_{k=1}^n A_k) \to 0$ as well. Thus there exists $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(\bigcap_{k=1}^N A_k) < r/2 < r \le d(A)$ . The set $B := \bigcap_{k=1}^N A_k$ is closed in $X$ and the tail sequence $(x_n)_{n \ge N}$ is contained in $B$ , so the limit point $x$ belongs to $B$ . It follows from $d(B) < r$ that we have $B \subseteq A$ . Finally, since $B$ is a member of $\mathcal{G}$ , we have $A \in \mathcal{G}$ also. This suggests that $\mathcal{G}$ is convergent (to $x$ ), a contradiction.","I'm trying to work with the many equivalent definitions of compactness for a topological space ; in particular, Every (proper) filter on has a (proper) convergent refinement.

Then, the compact convergence and compact-open topologies on $\mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ coincide. For completeness sake: the compact-open topology is generated by the sub-basis $$ \{S(K,U) : K \subseteq X \text{ compact}, U \subseteq Y \text{open}\} $$ with $S(K,U) = \{ f \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y) : f(K) \subseteq U\}$ , and the compact convergence topology is generated by the basis of open balls restricted to each compact set, $$ \{B_K(f,\varepsilon) : \varepsilon > 0 , K \subseteq X \text{ compact}\} $$ with $B_K(f,\varepsilon) = \{f \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y) : d(f(x),g(x)) < \varepsilon \ (\forall x \in K)\}$ . What follows is my attempt. I would highly appreciate any comments on whether it is correct, and in that case, on how to make this argument more elegant. Let's denote $\tau_{co}$ and $\tau_{c}$ for the compact-open and compact convergence topologies respectively and see both inclusions. ( $\tau_{co} \subseteq \tau_c$ ): let $S(K,U) \in \tau_{co}$ . It suffices to see that $S(K,U)$ is open with respect to the compact convergence topology. Let $f \in S(K,U)$ . Now, by defnition this means that $f(K) \subseteq U$ and so $f(K) \cap U^c = \emptyset$ . Since $K$ is compact, $f(K)$ is compact and so it is closed in $Y$ (because it is metric). Hence we have that $\delta_f := d(f(K),U^c)$ is positive. This implies that $ B_K(f,\delta_f) \subseteq S(K,U)$ . In effect, by the contrapositive if $g \in \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ is such that $g(K) \cap U^c$ is non empty, then taking $g(x) \in g(K) \cap U^c$ we get $$ d(f(x),g(x)) \geq d(f(K),U^c) = \delta_f. $$ This proves that $B_K(f,\delta) \subseteq S(K,U)$ and so $$ S(K,U) = \bigcup_{f \in S(K,U)}B_K(f,\delta_f) $$ is open for $\tau_c$ . ( $\tau_{c} \subseteq \tau_{co}$ ): with the same idea, let $B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ be an open set for $\tau_{co}$ and let's see that for each $g \in B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ , there exists $S(K',U') \in \tau_{co}$ with $g \in S(K',U') \subseteq B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ . Since $K$ is compact and the mapping $$ K \hookrightarrow X \xrightarrow{1 \times 1} X \times X \xrightarrow{(f,g)} Y \times Y \xrightarrow{d} \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} $$ is continuous, it attains a maximum, $$ \delta_g :=  \max_{x \in K}d(f(x),g(x)) < \varepsilon. $$ Now, let $\mu = \varepsilon - \delta_g$ , and note that the set $$ U := \{y \in Y  : d(y,g(k)) < \mu \ , \ (\forall k \in K)\} $$ is open: if $y\in U$ then $m_y := \max_{k \in K}d(y,g(k)) < \mu$ . Thus, if $d(z,y) < \mu -m_y$ , $$ d(z,g(k)) \leq d(z,y) + d(y,g(k)) < \mu - m_y + m_y = \mu $$ and therefore $B_{m_y}(y) \subseteq U$ . Finally if $h \in S(K,U)$ , then for each $x \in K$ we have that $$ d(h(x),f(x)) \leq d(h(x),g(x)) + d(g(x),f(x)) < \mu + \delta_g = \varepsilon, $$ which proves that $S(K,U) \subseteq B_K(f,\varepsilon)$ .

One can just define $H(f)=f \circ F$ and show that this $H$ has the desired properties.

For each point of the plane, we can take $\alpha>0$ and the parabolic region  $$\alpha(x-a)^2 <y-b,$$ and observe that $(a,b)$ does not satisfy the equality. Changing $\alpha$ will widen or narrow the parabolic region. Then, an open set in this topology will be  $$U=\{(a,b)\}\cup \{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2 : \alpha(x-a)^2 <y-b\}.$$ If we fix $\alpha$ for each point $(x,y)$ of the parabolic region (remember that the set $U$ has to contain $\textbf{a}$ parabolic region), we will be able to choose $\alpha_{(a,b)}$ (it can be very big) such that $U$ will contain all of the parabolic region with vertex $(x,y)$.

We know that $r$ is continuous, so we can only verify that $r$ is surjective and that if $c\in Z$ then there is an open $U$ of $Z$ such that $r^{-1}(U)=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}V_{\alpha}$ where $V_{\alpha}$ are open in $Y$ for all $\alpha\in A$ and $r|_{V_{\alpha}}: V_{\alpha}\to U$. To see the overjection, let's take $c\in Z$, therefore there is a $a\in X$ such that $q(a)=c$ since $q$ is surjective it because it is a covering function. Then $r(p(a))=c$ and as $p(a)\in Y$, then $p(a)$ is a preimage of $c$ and so $r$ is onto. Let $c\in Z$, since $q$ is a covering application, there is an open $U$ of $Z$ such that $c\in U$ and $q^{-1}(U)=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}V_{\alpha}$ and $q|_{V_{\alpha}}: V_{\alpha}\to U$ is a homeomorphism. Consider the family $\{p(V_{\alpha})\}_{\alpha\in A}$, let's see that $r^{-1}(U)=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}p(V_{\alpha})$ and that $r|_{p(V_{\alpha})}: p(V_{\alpha})\to U$ is a homeomorphism. In effect, as $r\circ q$, then $p(q^{-1}(U))=p(\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}V_{\alpha})=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}p(V_{\alpha})$ but $r^{-1}(U)=p(q^{-1}(U))=\sqcup_{\alpha\in A}p(V_{\alpha})$. How do I prove that $r|_{p(V_{\alpha})}: p(V_{\alpha})\to U$ is a homeomorphism? Thank you very much.",,"['general-topology', 'proof-verification', 'algebraic-topology']"

Thus for (*), there are two values of $t$ for each $x$ namely  $$t_1=\frac{2\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\|x-f(x)\|^2} \mbox{ and } t_2=\frac{2\langle x,x-f(x)\rangle - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\|x-f(x)\|^2}.$$ Let $$g_1(x)=(1-t_1)x+t_1f(x) \mbox{ and } g_2(x)=(1-t_2)(x)+t_2f(x).$$ What I saw was that when $x\in \partial D^n$ then $g_2(x)=x$ i.e. $g_2$ is a retraction. I was not getting that $g_1(x)=x$ for $x\in \partial D^n$; am I right? This is exactly the question I asked above before partial answer. Also, algebraically can we simplify some arguments to decide which $g_i$ is retraction?

Since, I know that f is continuous, I know that pre-images of open sets in R are open in the rectangle defined by [0,1] x [0,1].  Now, I want to prove that g(x)=max{f(x,y)) is continuous on [0,1].  The main problem, I think I'm having is I don't understand what: represents.  I want to take open sets and show that their pre-images are open in order to show that g(x) is continuous.  However, I'm not sure how to formalize this or how to construct an argument showing this.  Perhaps, using the definition of continuity using sequences would be better?

Let $X/\mathord{\sim}$ be the corresponding quotient space. Assume that the quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed. Question: Is $\sim$ necessarily a closed subset of $X\times X$ ? Let us note that the elements of $X/\mathord{\sim}$ are the equivalence classes, and the topology of $X/\mathord{\sim}$ consists of all sets $\mathcal{U}\subseteq X/{\mathord{\sim}}$ such that $\bigcup\mathcal{U}$ is an open subset of $X$ . The quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ assigns to each $x$ its corresponding equivalence class $[x]$ . We show that if the answer is 'no' then the example must be a non-regular space $X$ and an equivalence $\sim$ must be such that $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is not Hausdorff. We denote by $[A]$ the saturation of set $A\subseteq X$ with respect to the equivalence relation $\sim$ , that is, $[A]=\{x\in X\colon (\exists y\in A)\,x\sim y\}$ . Proposition: Let $X$ be a Hausdorff space and let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$ such that the quotient mapping $q\colon X\to X/\mathord{\sim}$ is closed and $\sim$ is not closed in $X\times X$ . Then $X$ is not regular and $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is not Hausdorff. Proof: The second part follows easily since if $X/\mathord{\sim}$ is Hausdorff then its diagonal $D=\{([x],[x])\colon\,x\in X\}$ is closed in $(X/\mathord{\sim})\times(X/\mathord{\sim})$ and $\sim$ is the preimage of $D$ under continuous mapping $q\times q\colon (x,y)\mapsto([x],[y])$ , hence $\sim$ is closed in $X\times X$ . To show the first part, assume that $X$ is regular, $q$ is a closed map and $\sim$ is not closed in $X\times X$ . Then $[x]$ is closed for every $x$ . There exist $u,v\in X$ such that $u\nsim v$ but for every neighbourhood $W\subseteq X\times X$ of $(u,v)$ there exists $(u_W,v_W)\in W$ such that $u_W\sim v_W$ . We have $u\notin [v]$ and $v\notin [u]$ hence by regularity of $X$ there exist open sets $U_0,U_1,V_0,V_1$ such that $u\in U_0$ , $v\in V_0$ , $[u]\subseteq U_1$ , $[v]\subseteq V_1$ , and $U_0\cap V_1=U_1\cap V_0=\emptyset$ . Denote by $\mathcal{W}$ the family of all open sets $W\subseteq U_0\times V_0$ containing $(u,v)$ , and let $A=\{u_W\colon W\in\mathcal{W}\}$ , $B=\{v_W\colon W\in\mathcal{W}\}$ . Then $u\in\mathrm{cl}{A}$ , $v\in\mathrm{cl}{B}$ , and $[A]=[B]$ . Since $A\subseteq U_0$ and $B\subseteq V_0$ , we have $A\cap [v]=B\cap [u]=\emptyset$ , hence $u,v\notin [A]=[B]$ . Since $q$ is a closed map, sets $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]$ , $[\mathrm{cl}{B}]$ are closed, hence $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]\supseteq\mathrm{cl}[A]=\mathrm{cl}[B]\supseteq \mathrm{cl}{B}$ , similarly also $[\mathrm{cl}{B}]\supseteq\mathrm{cl}{A}$ , hence $[\mathrm{cl}{A}]=[\mathrm{cl}{B}]$ . It follows that there exist $u'\in\mathrm{cl}{A}$ and $v'\in\mathrm{cl}{B}$ such that $u'\sim v$ and $u\sim v'$ , hence $u'\in [v]\subseteq V_1$ .

There is no hint to the exercise. Note 4: A closely related question is the following: Is the image of a Hausdorff space under a closed continuous mapping necessarily Hausdorff ? If this is true then we have also a positive answer to the original question.

My first question is: in the second line, when he concludes that the complementar is open, why? For me, in order for a complement of $D$ to be open, I have to prove that $X-D$ is open. How to prove that? Also, is he considering $V_x\times V_y$ an open? Why? Because an open in the cartesian product is an union of $U\times V$, where $U$ is open in $X$ and $V$ is open in $X$.",,['general-topology']

94,Is the set $\ell ^2$ a $G_\delta$ in $\mathbb R ^\omega$?,Is the set  a  in ?,\ell ^2 G_\delta \mathbb R ^\omega,"$\ell ^2$ = set of sequences $(x_i)$ of real numbers such that $\|x\|=\sum _{i=0} ^\infty x_i ^2<\infty$. Question: Is $\ell ^2$ a $G_\delta$-set in the product topology $\mathbb R ^\omega$? I am thinking the answer is no, but I'm not sure.  To prove this, I would presumably suppose $\ell ^2=\bigcap_{n\in\omega}U_n$, where each $U_n$ is open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$, and then consrtuct an element with infinite norm that is in each $U_n$. Answer: Ok, I think I've got a proof (that the answer is no). Please comment to let me know if you think it's alright. Proof. Suppose $\ell ^2=\bigcap_{n\in\omega}U_n$, where each $U_n$ is open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$. There is a basic open set $B_0$ such that $x_0:=\langle 1,0,0,...\rangle\in B_0\subseteq U_0$. Let $\text{supp}(B_0)$ be the index of the last nontrivial open subset of $\mathbb R$ that generates $B_0$, and let $\sigma_0=x_0\restriction \text{supp}(B_0)+1$. Now take a basic open $B_1$ such that $x_1:=\sigma_0^\frown \langle 1,0,0,...\rangle\in B_1\subseteq U_1$. We may assume $\text{supp}(B_1)>\text{supp}(B_0)$. Let $\sigma_1=x_1\restriction \text{supp}(B_1)+1$. Continuing this process, we construct an infinite sequence $\bigcup _{n\in\omega} \sigma_n$ which is in  every $U_n$, yet it has infinitely many $1$'s, and thus has infinite norm. That's a contradiction. $\square$ That seemed easy, so... New Question. Is $\ell ^2$ first category as a subspace of $\mathbb R ^\omega$? Answer: Yes. By comparing the usual metrics on $\ell^2$ and $\mathbb R ^\omega$, we can see that the usual topology on $\ell^2$ is finer than its topology as a subspace of $\mathbb R ^\omega$. Thus $F_n:=\{x\in \ell^2:\|x\|\leq n\}$ is closed in $\ell^2$ with the subspace topology. We show each is nowhere dense in $\ell^2$. Consider an open set $U\cap \ell^2$, where $U$ is basic open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$. Let $V=U\cap \pi_j^{-1}[(n,\infty)]$.  If $j>\text{supp}(U)$ then we have $V\neq\varnothing$. Thus $V\cap \ell^2$ is a nonempty open subset of $U\cap \ell^2$, and it misses $F_n$. This leads to a different proof that $\ell^2$ is not $G_\delta$. For if it were, it would be completely metrizable, as $\mathbb R ^\omega$ is completely metrizable and therefore so is each $G_\delta$ in it. But of course a complete metric space is not first category.","$\ell ^2$ = set of sequences $(x_i)$ of real numbers such that $\|x\|=\sum _{i=0} ^\infty x_i ^2<\infty$.
