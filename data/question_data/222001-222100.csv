Here's (my slight paraphrasing of) the section that's bothering me: Let $R$ be a complete DVR and let $S = \operatorname{Spec}R$.  Let $s \in S$ be the closed point.  Let $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow S$ be a proper scheme over $S$ with generic fibre $X$ and special fibre $\mathcal{X}_s$.  For any closed point $x \in X$, the Zariski closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible finite scheme over $S$ and is therefore a local scheme with closed point $\overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$. One then defines the reduction map $r\colon X^0 \rightarrow \mathcal{X}_s$, where $X^0$ is the set of closed points of $X$, by $r(x) = \overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$.  Here are my questions: What is the point of considering the Zariski closure of a closed point?  By definition $x$ is closed precisely when $\{x\} = \overline{\{x\}}$, so this part of the definition seems redundant.  Am I missing something obvious?

Oxford University Press, 2002","I have a few basic questions about Liu's [1, Section 10.1.3] description of the reduction map from the closed points of the generic fibre of a proper scheme over a complete DVR to its special fibre.  Here's (my slight paraphrasing of) the section that's bothering me: Let $R$ be a complete DVR and let $S = \operatorname{Spec}R$.  Let $s \in S$ be the closed point.  Let $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow S$ be a proper scheme over $S$ with generic fibre $X$ and special fibre $\mathcal{X}_s$.  For any closed point $x \in X$, the Zariski closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible finite scheme over $S$ and is therefore a local scheme with closed point $\overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$. One then defines the reduction map $r\colon X^0 \rightarrow \mathcal{X}_s$, where $X^0$ is the set of closed points of $X$, by $r(x) = \overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$.  Here are my questions: What is the point of considering the Zariski closure of a closed point?  By definition $x$ is closed precisely when $\{x\} = \overline{\{x\}}$, so this part of the definition seems redundant.  Am I missing something obvious? More importantly, I don't understand how to interpret the intersection $\overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$ since the two sets in question don't share a common ""parent"" space.

Let $\mathfrak{m} \subset \mathcal{O}$ be the ideal sheaf of a point in some projective space $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P}^n$ , and $0 < c < 1$ a real number. We denote $\Gamma_\bullet(\mathbf{P}, \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^c )$ to be the graded linear series $$(\Gamma_\bullet(\mathbf{P}^b, \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^c ))_m := H^0(\mathbf{P}, \mathcal{O}(m) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^{\lceil cm\rceil }).$$ For a greaded linear series $|V_\bullet|$ we define its volume to be $\limsup_{m \to \infty} (n!\dim(V_m))/m^n$ . It is claimed in the book that the volume of $\Gamma_\bullet(\mathbf{P}, \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^c)$ is $1 - c$ but my calculation yielded $1 - c^n$ . I am wondering where/if I went wrong. Thanks! I'll write my calculation below. We note that $\mathcal{O}(m) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^{\lceil cm\rceil }$ fits into the short exact sequence below, which remains exact when we take global sections. $$0 \to \mathcal{O}(m) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^{\lceil cm\rceil } \to \mathcal{O}(m) \to \mathbf{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]/((x_1, \dots, x_n)^{\lceil mc \rceil}) \to0$$ The sheaf on the right is a skyskraper sheaf at $x$ , with local coordinates $x_1, \dots, x_n$ . Now homogenizing polynomials allows us to identify $\mathbf{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]/((x_1, \dots, x_n)^{\lceil mc \rceil}) $ with homogeneous polynomials in $\mathbf{C}[x_0, \dots, x_n]$ of degree exactly $\lceil mc \rceil - 1$ . Hence, we get that $$h^0(\mathcal{O}(m) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^{\lceil mc \rceil}) = P(m) - P(\lceil mc \rceil - 1)$$ where $P$ is the hilbert polynomial of $\mathbf{P}^n$ . Now, the growth of this with respect to $m$ is determined by the highest order terms, so $$\text{vol}(\Gamma_\bullet(\mathbf{P}^b, \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^c )) =  \limsup_{m \to \infty} \frac{n!}{m^n} (m^n/n! - (\lceil mc \rceil - 1)^n/n!) = \limsup (1 - (\lceil mc \rceil - 1)^n/m^n).$$ But now, the last expression is a limit, and equal to $$1 - (\lim_{m \to \infty} \frac{\lceil mc \rceil - 1}{m})^n = 1 - c^n.$$ Edit: I wanted to clean up what was written above, and to include an additional simple explanation that confirms what we already know. For rational $c$ , global sections considerations allows us to identify the volume of $\Gamma_\bullet(\mathbf{P}, \mathcal{O}(1) \otimes \mathfrak{m}^c)$ with the volume of $H - cE$ in $N^1(\operatorname{Bl}_x\mathbf{P})_{\mathbf{R}}$ , where $H$ is the pullback of a hyperplane.

We wish to show that there is a dense open subset $U \subseteq (\mathbb{P}^n)^\vee$ such that for each closed point $H \in U$ , $H \cap X$ is smooth and $X \not\subseteq H$ . Essentially, Vakil proceeds by defining a closed subvariety of $Z \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n \times (\mathbb{P}^n)^\vee$ spanned by points $(p \in X, H)$ such that $p \in H$ and either $p$ is singular in $X \cap H$ or $X \subseteq H$ . He accomplishes this by cutting out the equations for $X$ , adding one equation enforcing $p \in H$ and then requiring the corank of the resultant Jacobian to be $\mathsf{dim}(X)$ . The details are in the following quote: 12.4.3. We first define $Z$ more precisely, in terms of equations on $\Bbb P^n\times\Bbb P^{n\vee}$ , where the coordinates on $\Bbb P^n$ are $x_0,\dots,x_n$ , and the dual coordinates on $\Bbb P^{n\vee}$ are $a_0,\dots,a_n$ . Suppose $X$ is cut out by $f_1,\dots,f_r$ . Then we take these equations as the first of the defining equations of $Z$ . (So far we have defined the subscheme $X\times\Bbb P^{n\vee}$ .) We also add the equation $a_0x_0+\cdots+a_nx_n=0$ . (So far we have described the subscheme of $\Bbb P^n\times\Bbb P^{n\vee}$ corresponding to the points $(p,H)$ where $p\in X$ and $p\in H$ .) Note that the Jacobian matrix ((12.1.6.1), except with variables starting with $x_0$ rather than $x_1$ ) $$\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_0}(p) & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_r}{\partial x_0}(p) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}(p) & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_r}{\partial x_n}(p) \end{pmatrix}$$ has corank equal to $\dim X$ at all closed points of $X$ -- this is precisely the Jacobian criterion for regularity (Exercise 12.2.D). We then require that the Jacobian matrix with a new colum $$\begin{pmatrix} a_0 \\ \vdots \\ a_n\end{pmatrix}$$ appended has corank $\geq \dim X$ (hence $=\dim X$ ). This is cut out by equations (the determinants of certain minors). By the Jacobian description of the Zariski tangent space, this condition encodes the requirement that the Zariski tangent space of $H\cap X$ at $p$ has dimension precisely $\dim X$ , which is $\dim H\cap X+1$ (i.e., $H\cap X$ is singular at $p$ ) if $H$ does not contain $X$ , or if $H$ contains $X$ . This is precisely the notion we wished to capture. (Remark 12.4.4 works through an example, which may help clarify how this works.) There appears to be a small typo here: since we are considering the affine cone of $X$ in this, we should be careful to potentially replace $\mathsf{dim}(X)$ with $\mathsf{dim}(X + 1)$ . Question I am stuck attempting to understand the next part of the proof. Having defined $Z$ , Vakil claims the fiber of $Z$ over $\{p\} \times (\mathbb{P}^k)^\vee$ is cut out of $(\mathbb{P}^k)^\vee$ by $\mathsf{dim}(X) + 1$ linear conditions, but I'm afraid I don't see where these come from at all. The second linked question I've linked to above chases down the obvious answer: it's the requirement that certain minors vanish, but this doesn't seem to lead to the correct number of equations, but no clear alternatives present themselves. The set is clearly closed, but the requirement that it be determined by $\mathsf{dim}(X) + 1$ linear equations specifically is important and elusive. For completeness, I've included the direct quote from Vakil below: We next show that $\dim Z\leq n-1$ . For each closed point $p\in X$ , let $W_p$ be the locus of hyperplanes containing $p$ , such that $H\cap X$ is singular at $p$ , or else contains all of $X$ ; what is the dimension of $W_p$ ? Suppose $\dim X = d$ . Then the restrictions on the hyperplanes in definition of $W_p$ correspond to $d+1$ linear conditions. (Do you see why?) This means that $W_p$ is a codimension $d+1$ , or dimension $n-d-1$ , ...","As I'm reading through Vakil's notes on algebraic geometry , I'm stumbling over some of the details in his proof of Bertini's theorem.

43,On the algebraic formulation of the Clifford algebra,On the algebraic formulation of the Clifford algebra,,"I apologize in advance for a rather wordy question. As a physicist trying to learn new mathematics, I figured this was the place to ask. I am having trouble understanding the algebraic formulation of Clifford algebras and I am (hopefully) looking for some clarity. I will say from the get-go, that my understanding of quotient spaces and ideals are elementary . By this I mean, that I understand the basic definitions at  face-value and some of the simpler examples, though both subjects has always been somewhat confusing to me. So forgive my ignorance in advance. What I understand: Up until now, my understanding of Clifford algebras is the following (I'll be brief and omit details): If $(V,g)$ is a vector space, equipped with a symmetric, bilinear form $g : V \times V \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ , then the Clifford algebra $\text{C}\ell (V,g)$ of $V$ is the algebra spanned by the elements of $V$ , subject to the condition that $v^2=g(v,v)$ . From this, I can deduce and understand that $\text{C}\ell^{\pm} (\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the algebra generated by the vectors subject to $v_i v_j +v_j v_i = \pm 2 \delta_{ij}$ . I understand also that the Clifford product of any two vectors $u,v$ may be written as $uv=u \cdot v + u \wedge v$ , where $u \cdot v$ is the inner product and $u \wedge v$ is the wedge product. From this, the representations of the various Clifford algebras follows (both in the real and complex cases) and I'm pretty happy. What I don't understand: Now, if  I move on to more advanced texts, I often come across the following: If $T(V)$ is the tensor algebra $T(V) := \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\infty} V^{k \otimes}$ , with $T^0(V) = \mathbb{F}$ , then the Clifford algebra $\text{C}\ell(V,g)$ is the quotient $\text{C}\ell (V,g)=T(V)/I(V)$ of $T(V)$ by the ideal $I(V)$ , generated by the elements of the form $v \otimes u + u \otimes v -2g(u,v)$ . Though I know what all the ingredients are, I simply do not see the correlation between this definition and the more ""geometric"" notion of a Clifford algebra! All my intuitions about the subject are gone. From my (again, very basic) understanding of quotient spaces, $\text{C}\ell (V,g)$ should be the space of equivalence classes, where $u \sim v$ iff $u = v+w$ for some $w \in I(V)$ . Working from the definition of the ideal, I can deduce that $u \otimes v \sim \frac{1}{2}(u\otimes v-v \otimes u)+g(u,v) = u \wedge v + g(u,v)$ , but I cannot get much further and it does not do any wonders for my understanding. I will try to be concrete: Questions: 1) How is the ""algebraic"" definition of the Clifford algebra $\text{C}\ell(V,g)$ (above) related to the concept of the Clifford algebra as the algebra generated by elements in $V$ , subject to the condition that $v^2=g(v,v)$ (in the most general sense)? 2) How does one obtain the Clifford product, now that the Clifford algebra is a space of equivalence classes? 3) Why is this definition of the Clifford algebra ""useful"", as opposed to the geometric formulation?","I apologize in advance for a rather wordy question.

89,Some questions about Hartshorne chapter 2 proposition 2.6,Some questions about Hartshorne chapter 2 proposition 2.6,,"In Hartshorne chapter 2 proposition 2.6, Hartshorne shows that there is a fully faithful functor $t:\mathcal{Var}\rightarrow \mathcal{Sch}(k)$ from the category of varieties over $k$ to the category of schemes over $k$ . He proceeds as follows: First, for any topological space $X$ , define $t(X)$ to be the set of irreducible closed subsets of $X$ . We can define a topology on $t(X)$ by taking as closed sets the subsets of the form $t(Y)$ , where $Y$ is closed subset of $X$ . If $f:X_1\rightarrow X_2$ is continuous, then define a map $$t(f):t(X_1)\rightarrow t(X_2)\\ Y\mapsto \overline{f(Y)},$$ where $Y$ is a irreducible closed subset of $X_1$ . And, for any topological space $X$ , define $\alpha :X\rightarrow t(X)$ by $\alpha(p)=\overline{\{p\}}$ . Question 1: Why is $\overline{f(Y)}$ a irreducible closed subset of $X_2$ ? Next, let $V$ be an affine variety over $k$ with coordinate ring $A$ , and $O_V$ its sheaf of regular functions, he then shows that $(t(V), \alpha_*(O_V))$ is isomorphic to the affine scheme $(X,O_X)$ , where $X=\operatorname{Spec}A$ . Question 2: Why is $(t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))$ a locally ringed spaces, I mean why is $(\alpha_*(O_V))_Y$ a local ring for any $Y\in t(V)$ ? Now define a morphism of locally ringed spaces $\beta:(V,O_V)\rightarrow X=\operatorname{Spec}A,$ by $\beta(p)=m_p$ . And for any open set $U\subset X$ ,define a homomorphism of rings $O_X(U)\rightarrow \beta_*(O_V)(U)$ :given $s\in O_X(U)$ , $p\in \beta^{-1}(U)$ , we get a regular function $g$ on $\beta^{-1}(U)$ by $g(p):=\overline{s_{\beta(p)}}\in A_{m_p}/m_p=k$ ,where $s_{\beta(p)}\in O_{X,\beta(p)}$ and we identify the stalk $O_{X,\beta(p)}$ with the local ring $A_{m_p}$ . Question 3: Why is $g$ a regular function? It seems to me that $g$ is locally constant, is this true? Then he claims that the above homomorphism $O_X(U)\rightarrow \beta_*(O_V)(U)$ is an isomorphism and uses the fact that there is a 1-1 correspondence $t(V)\leftrightarrow \operatorname{Spec}A=X$ , then $(X,O_X)\cong (t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))$ as locally ringed spaces. I can't follow this part of proof. Question 4: What is this $\beta$ used for? Shouldn't we construct a morphism $(t(V),\alpha_*(O_V))\rightarrow (X,O_X)$ ?
