1,Which sequences of $\pm 1$ can appear as the image of a Hilbert symbol,Which sequences of  can appear as the image of a Hilbert symbol,\pm 1,"In his book A Course in Arithmetic , Serre adresses the question of which sequences $\pm 1$ can appear as the image of a Hilbert symbol. By this I mean the following: Let $V$ denote the set of places of $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $(a,b)_v$ denote the Hilbert symbol of two numbers $a,b \in \mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ at a place $v \in V$ : Theorem. Let $(a_i)_{i \in I}$ be a finite family of elements in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ and let $(\varepsilon_{i,v})_{i\in I, v \in V}$ be a family of numbers equal to $\pm 1$ . In order that there exists $x \in \mathbb{Q}^{\times}$ such that $(a_i,x)_v = \varepsilon_{i,v}$ for all $i \in I$ and all $v \in V$ , it is necessary and sufficient that the following conditions be satisfied: Almost all the $\varepsilon_{i,v}$ are equal to $1$ . For all $i \in I$ we have $\prod_{v \in V} \varepsilon_{i,v}=1$ (i.e. the sequence always satisfies Hilbert reciprocity). For all $v \in V$ there exists $x_v \in \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}^{\times}$ such that $(a_i,x_v)_v = \varepsilon_{i,v}$ for all $i \in I$ . The above is theorem 4 from section 2.2 of chapter 3 of ibid. I have two questions concerning this: Though I have searched quite extensively, I have not been able to find another resource where the question of which binary sequences can appear as the image of a Hilbert symbol is treated.

3,$\sum_{d|n} \phi (\tau (d))=?$,,\sum_{d|n} \phi (\tau (d))=?,"So I have just taken a course on elementary number theory and started playing around with Eulers totient function $\phi (n)$ and $\tau (n):= \#\{\text{divisors of } n\}$ . I read about Gauss theorem which states that for positive integers $n\geq 1$ $$\sum_{d|n} \phi (d)=n$$ and then thought of a ""similar"" question which is stated in the title, that is $$\boxed {\sum_{d|n} \phi (\tau (d))=?}$$ I tried out some case that would be simpler than finding a general formula for this sum, which is when $n=p^{k}$ where $p$ is prime and $k$ is a positive integer. Reason being that there are simpler indentities to work with regarding $\phi (n)$ and $\tau (n)$ when $n$ is a power of a  prime. I will present what I found to be true on a more heuristic/evidential basis. Meaning that I have not yet proven the results. Here are my results: Let $p$ be a prime and $k$ a positive integer. Then we have that: $\boxed{\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k+1} \phi (i)=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k} \phi (i)+\phi (k+1)}.$ $\boxed{\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))\stackrel{?}{\equiv} 0 \pmod 2}$ , if $k\geq 1$ . Proving the first identity is rather simple. Simply note that the divisors of $p^{k}$ are the following list of integers: $\underbrace{p^{0}, p^{1}, \ldots , p^{k-1}, p^{k}}_{k+1}$ . Meaning in particular that $p^{k}$ has exactly $k+1$ divisors. Thus $$\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))= \phi (\tau (p^{0}))+\phi (\tau (p^{1}))+\ldots +\phi (\tau (p^{k})) = \phi (1)+\phi (2)+\ldots +\phi(k)+\phi (k+1)=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k+1} \phi (i)$$ which follow from the fact that $\tau (p^{k})=k+1$ . Thus $$\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k+1} \phi (i)=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k} \phi (i)+\phi (k+1).$$ That $\boxed{\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))\equiv 0 \pmod 2}$ I found by experimentation but I dont know exactly how to prove this, given that I have not made any mistakes, that is... Since $\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {k+1} \phi (i)$ one finds that: If $n=p^{1}$ , then $\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {1+1} \phi (i)=\phi (1)+\phi (2)=1+1=2$ . If $n=p^{2}$ , then $\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {2+1} \phi (i)=\phi (1)+\phi (2) + \phi (3)=2+2=4$ . If $n=p^{3}$ , then $\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {3+1} \phi (i)=\phi (1)+\phi (2)+\phi (3)+\phi (4)=4+2=6$ If $n=p^{4}$ , then $\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {4+1} \phi (i)=\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {4} \phi (i)+\phi (5)=6+4=10$ , so on and so forth. I made calculations up to $n=p^{6}$ which gives $\sum\limits_ {i=1}^ {6+1} \phi (i)=18$ , which suggests that $$\sum_{d|p^{k}} \phi (\tau (d))\stackrel{?}{\equiv} 0 \pmod 2$$ if $k\geq 1$ .

Show that the elliptic curve $\mathcal C : Y^2=X\left(X^2-pX+p^2\right)$ has Mordell-Weil rank 0. Because of the layout of the course, I am 99% certain that this question can be solved by a fairly standard 2-descent argument. The problem is, I get stuck at excluding a potential generator. I'll set up the 2-descent and then explain where I get stuck. Let $\mathcal D: V^2=U(U^2+2pU-3p^2)$ . Then $\mathcal D$ is an elliptic curve, and there are 2-isogenies $\varphi\colon\mathcal C\to\mathcal D$ and $\hat{\varphi}\colon\mathcal D\to\mathcal C$ such that $\varphi\circ\hat{\varphi}$ and $\hat{\varphi}\circ\varphi$ are the multiplication-by-2 maps. We calculate $\mathcal C[2](\mathbb Q)$ (the rational 2-torsion of $\mathcal C$ ), $G:=\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)/\hat{\varphi}(\mathcal D(\mathbb Q))$ and $\hat{\varphi}(H):=\hat{\varphi}(\mathcal D(\mathbb Q)/\varphi(\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)))$ . From these last two sets we can calculate $\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)/2\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)$ and this, combined with the 2-torsion, allows us to determine the rank of $\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)$ . Obviously $\mathcal C[2](\mathbb Q)=\{\mathcal O,(0,0)\}\cong C_2$ , so that's fine. To calculate $G$ , we define a map $\hat{q}\colon G\to\mathbb Q^\times/\left(\mathbb Q^\times\right)^2$ by $\mathcal O\mapsto1,(0,y)\mapsto p^2=1$ and $(x,y)\mapsto x$ when $x\neq0$ . One can show that $\hat{q}$ is a well-defined injective group homomorphism, whose image consists of all squarefree integers $r\mid p^2$ for which there exist integers $l,m$ and $n$ , not all 0, with $\gcd(l,m)=1$ , such that $$\hat{W}_r : rl^4-pl^2m^2+p^2m^4/r = n^2.$$ Thus $\mathrm{im}~\hat{q}\leq\{\pm1,\pm p\}$ . We have $\hat{q}(\mathcal O)=\hat{q}(0,0)=1$ . The equations $\hat{W}_{-1}$ and $\hat{W}_{-p}$ have the form ""nonpositive = nonnegative"", so have no nontrivial solutions. On dividing $\hat{W}_p$ through by $p$ and completing the square, one can see that this has a solution mod $p$ only if 3 is a square mod $p$ , or $p\mid l$ and $m$ . The former is excluded by the given congruence info, the latter by $\gcd(l,m)=1$ . Thus $\mathrm{im}~\hat{q}=\{1\}$ and $G=\{\mathcal O\}$ . To calculate $H$ , in a similar vein we define a map $q$ by $\mathcal O\mapsto1,(0,v)\mapsto -3p^2=-3$ and $(u,v)\mapsto u$ when $u\neq0$ . Now we're looking for squarefree integers $r\mid-3p^2$ satisfying $$W_r : rl^4+2pl^2m^2-3p^2m^4/r=n^2.$$ Thus $\mathrm{im}~q\leq\{\pm1,\pm3,\pm p,\pm3p\}$ . Note that $\mathcal D$ factorises as $V^2=U(U-p)(U+3p)$ , so we have $q(\mathcal O)=1$ , $q(0,0)=-3$ , $q(p,0)=p$ and $q(-3p,0)=-3p$ . There's only one nontrivial coset left, so it suffices to exclude any one of $-1, 3$ , $-p$ or $3p$ from $\mathrm{im}~q$ to demonstrate that $\mathrm{im}~q=\{1,-3,p,-3p\}$ . The relevant equations are: $$W_{-1}:-l^4+2pl^2m^2+3p^2m^4=n^2,$$ $$W_{3}:3l^4+2pl^2m^2-p^2m^4=n^2,$$ $$W_{-p}:-pl^4+2pl^2m^2+3pm^4=n^2,$$ $$W_{3p}:3pl^4+2pl^2m^2-m^4=n^2.$$ The problem — It's in showing that one of the above equations has no solution that I get stuck. I've looked at them mod $p$ , mod 3, mod 9, even mod 16, and I've tried completing the square, but I can't seem to arrive at a contradiction. I believe that we need to exclude the above values of $r$ to get rank 0, which I will now justify. Let's suppose on the contrary that $\mathrm{im}~q=\{\pm1,\pm3,\pm p,\pm3p\}$ . Then $H=\langle (0,0),(0,p),R \rangle$ , where $R$ is some other point on $\mathcal D(\mathbb Q)$ (say $q(R)=-1$ ). Now $\hat{\varphi}(\mathcal O)=\hat{\varphi}(0,0)=\mathcal O$ and $\hat{\varphi}(0,p)=\hat{\varphi}(0,-3p)=(0,0)$ , so since $\hat{\varphi}$ is 2-to-1, $\hat{\varphi}(R)$ is independent of $(0,0)$ in $\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)/2\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)$ . Thus $\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)/2\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)=\langle (0,0),R \rangle\cong C_2\times C_2$ . So on removing the 2-torsion we get that the rank of $\mathcal C(\mathbb Q)$ is 1. Which is not 0. So we need to exclude this point $R$ . Edit: Simplicity of Solution — I'm not entirely sure whether this contravenes the rules of this site, but since this question comes from an exam, I require a solution that could reasonably be believed to be arrived at by a late undergraduate/early graduate who has only been acquainted with elliptic curves for one term, has approximately 30 minutes, and no access to a computer.","The question is from a masters' level elliptic curves exam (Oxford, 2017): Let be a prime congruent to 2 (mod 3) and 5 (mod 8).

9,Iterated polynomials modulo $p$ and divisibility properties,Iterated polynomials modulo  and divisibility properties,p,"Looking around Math.SE, I found this interesting question about the compositeness of the product of a list of numbers (specifically primes) plus one. As the questioner points out there, this recursive application (starting after the first application) can also be represented by the polynomial $x(x-1)+1 = x^2-x+1$ . Furthermore, a user comments that for inputs not congruent to $0,1 \mod 7$ , this will always result in a composite number in a finite number of steps. One can easily see that $0$ and $1$ $\mod p$ for any prime $p$ will always be an exception. An intuitive way to represent this mathematically is a graph structure that maps an input residue to its output residue and checking if there is a path from the input to zero (signalling compositeness for a certain residue class after exactly [path length] iterations). Let's call these residues ""good"". Let's also call residue systems for that every input ends up at zero ""good systems"". Naturally, the first question to ask after looking at the comments is: Can we do ""better""?.

Set $A(x) = \sum_{n \leq x} a_n$ , $B(x) = \sum_{n \leq x} b_n$ , and $C(x) = \sum_{n \leq x} c_n$ . If $A(x) = o(x)$ and $B(x) = o(x)$ , must it be true that $C(x) = o(x)$ , or is there a (simple) counterexample? And if there is a counterexample, is the conclusion valid if we also assume $A(x)$ or $B(x)$ is $O_\delta(x^{1-\delta})$ for some $\delta$ in $(0,1)$ but introduce no further assumptions? This question came up when editing some course notes. When proving various relations are equivalent to the prime number theorem, the proof that $\sum_{n \leq x} \mu(n) = o(x)$ implies $\psi(x) \sim x$ appears to be basically the same everywhere I have looked and I'd prefer if there were a different argument. In the standard proof (whose basic structure goes back to Landau (see Section 1)), you reduce the problem to checking that $$ \sum_{dd' \leq x} \mu(d)(\log(d') - \tau(d') + 2\gamma) = o(x), $$ where $\tau(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} d$ and $\gamma$ is Euler's constant. The proof of this $o(x)$ estimate uses the following three properties: $\sum_{n \leq x} \mu(n) = o(x)$ , $\sum_{n \leq x} (\log(n) - \tau(n) + 2\gamma) = O(\sqrt{x})$ , $|\mu(n)| \leq 1$ for all $a$ . Abstracting what makes the proof work, we can say for my question at the start that $A(x) = o(x)$ and $B(x) = o(x)$ implies $C(x) = o(x)$ if we add the conditions that $\{a_n\}$ is bounded (think $a_n = \mu(n)$ ) and $B(x) = O_\delta(x^{1-\delta})$ for some $\delta$ in $(0,1)$ (think $b_n = \log(n) - \tau(n) + 2\gamma$ and $\delta = 1/2$ ). I would prefer a proof of $C(x) = o(x)$ that is more symmetric in the assumptions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ while still being applicable to the intended example above ( $a_n = \mu(n)$ and $b_n = \log n - \tau(n) + 2\gamma$ ).

Here: $\overline{\rho}: G_{F,S} \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F})$ is the residue representation. Here $S$ is a finite set of finite places of $F$ containing $\{v | p\}$ , where $F$ is a number field (a finite extension over $\mathbb{Q}$ ). Here $G_{F,S}$ is the Galois group of the maximum extension over $F$ which is unramified outside $S \sqcup \{ v | \infty \}$ . $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}$ consists of traceless matrices $M \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$ with $G_{F,S}$ -conjugation action $\sigma \cdot X := \overline{\rho}(\sigma) X \overline{\rho}(\sigma)^{-1}$ . $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ is its Tate twist $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p(1)$ . Via the $G_{F,S}$ -action on $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}$ and $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ , we can consider the $G_{F,S}$ -cohomology with coefficients in $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}$ and $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ accordingly.

(Where $G_{F(\zeta_p)}$ is the absolute Galois group of $F(\zeta_p)$ ). My attempt : The zeroth cohomology group $H_0(G_{F,S}, \mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1))$ consists of exactly the elements in $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ fixed by $G_{F,S}$ , so it is essential to figure out the action of $G_{F,S}$ on $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ . Then I have found someone claimed that Elements in $H_0(G_{F,S}, \mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1))$ correspond to the intertwining operators $\overline{\rho} \rightarrow \overline{\rho}(1)$ between $G_{F(\zeta_p)}$ -modules. But how to prove this claim? . After proving this claim, Schur's lemma implies that $H_0(G_{F,S}, \mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)) = 0$ and we are done. My question 2 : Let $v$ be a Taylor-Wiles prime of $F$ . (i.e. $v$ is a finite place of $F$ satisfying the two conditions: the norm of $v$ (denoted by $q_v$ ) satisfies $q_v \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ ; and $\overline{\rho}(\mathrm{Frob}_v) \in \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F})$ has distinct eigenvalues.) Let $F_v$ be the completion of $F$ wrt $v$ and $G_v$ be its (local) absolute Galois group. Via $$ G_v \hookrightarrow G_F \twoheadrightarrow G_{F,S} \xrightarrow{\overline{\rho}} \mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}), $$ we can consider the $G_v$ action on $\mathrm{ad}^0 \overline{\rho}(1)$ .

Proof: Consider the monic polynomial $$P(X)=X^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+a_na_{n-2}X^{n-2}+\ldots+a_n^{n-2}a_1X+a_n^{n-1}a_0\in\mathbb{Z}[X]$$ Then $$P(a_n\alpha)=(a_n\alpha)^n+a_{n-1}(a_n\alpha)^{n-1}+a_na_{n-2}(a_n\alpha)^{n-2}+\ldots+a_n^{n-2}a_1(a_n\alpha)+a_n^{n-1}a_0\\=a_n^{n-1}(a_n\alpha^n+a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1}+a_{n-2}\alpha^{n-2}+\ldots+a_1\alpha+a_0)=a_n^{n-1}f(\alpha)=0$$ Hence $a_n\alpha$ , being a root of the monic polynomial $P(X)$ in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ , is an algebraic integer. My question: Denote the set of algebraic integers by $\mathbb{A}$ . Then the theorem says for a particular algebraic number $\alpha$ the set $$S_{\alpha}=\{|m|:m\in\mathbb{Z},m\alpha\in\mathbb{A}\}\setminus\{0\}\neq\emptyset$$ Consider the algebraic number $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ . Clearly $3\in S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}$ . The minimal polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ for $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}$ is $9X^2-2$ . Hence by the theorem $9\in S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}}$ . Moreover since $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3},\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$ are not algebraic integers we have $\min(S_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}})=3$ . This example shows that $a_n$ is not necessarily $\mathrm{min}(S_{\alpha})$ . But by Well-ordering principle $\min(S_{\alpha})$ exists.

To give an example, consider the Euler totient function $\phi(n) = \lvert \{ x \leq n \mid (x,n) = 1  \} \rvert$ . If we try to estimate the size of $\sum_{n \leq X} \phi(n)$ as $X \rightarrow \infty$ we might loosely argue as follows: By the definition of $\phi$ we expect $\sum_{n \leq X} \phi(n)$ to be of order $X^2$ with density given by the probability of two random numbers $m,n\leq X$ being coprime. Assuming that the prime factors of a given number are random we might estimate this probability to be $\frac{1}{2} \prod_{p \leq X} \left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right)$ , where the factor of $1/2$ appears because we need to attribute for counting both the pair $(m,n)$ and $(n,m)$ In fact, a fairly basic argument shows that $$ \sum_{n \leq X} \phi(n) \sim \frac{3}{\pi^2}X^2,  $$ where we note that $$ \frac{1}{2} \prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2} \right) = \frac{1}{2\cdot\zeta(2)} = \frac{3}{\pi^2}, $$ so the heuristic argument predicted the correct asymptotic.

I believe the following is such a characterization and want to know if you agree: Let $K$ be a field. I think that $K$ is formally real iff it has a quadratic extension $L$ such that, for any finite Galois extension $M/K$ containing $L$ , there is an involution of $M/K$ that extends the involution of $L/K$ . Do you agree? Here is my thinking. $K$ is formally real if and only if it lies in a real-closed subfield of its algebraic closure $\overline K$ (because if it is formally real, its real-closure is such a subfield, and if it lies in a real-closed field, it inherits an order by restriction so it is formally real). In turn, there is a real-closed subfield $K_R$ of $\overline K$ containing $K$ if and only if there is an involution of $\overline K / K$ ; if there is such an involution, then $K_R$ is its fixed field, and if $K_R\supset K$ exists, then $[K:K_R]=2$ , thus there is an involution fixing $K_R$ and therefore $K$ . To summarize, $K$ is formally real iff its absolute galois group $G_K := \operatorname{Gal}(\overline K/K)$ contains an involution. The above is an attempt to render the statement "" $G_K$ contains an involution"" in finite-Galois-theoretic terms. Since $G_K$ is the inverse limit of the finite Galois groups over $K$ , it seems to me that "" $G_K$ contains an involution"" literally means ""there is a Galois field extension $L/K$ with an involution and such that every Galois extension of $K$ containing $L$ contains an involution that restricts to this one."" Thus if there is no involution in $G_K$ , no such $L$ exists at all. It remains to argue that if there is such an involution, then $L$ can be taken to be quadratic over $K$ . I think this because if there is an involution in $G_K$ , then let $K_R$ be its fixed field. Then $K_R$ is formally real, so doesn't contain $i = \sqrt{-1}$ , so then neither does $K$ , and then $L$ can be taken to be $K(i)$ .","I have been trying to come up with a characterization of formally real fields in terms of their finite Galois theory, in order to pique the curiosity of a friend who is a distinguished algebraist, who cares a great deal about finite Galois theory and not at all about formally real fields.

98,Sums of fifth powers of rational integers,Sums of fifth powers of rational integers,,"We have the polynomial identity $360\ (2X + 1) = (X+1)^{5} + (X+4)^{5} + (-X -3)^{5} + (-X -3)^{5} - (X-2)^{5} - (X-2)^{5} + (X-3)^{5} + X^{5}.$ Thus, every rational integer that is the product of $360$ by an odd rational integer is the sum of $8$ fifth powers of rational integers. If $x$ is a rational integer prime to $6$, then $x$ is of the form $y^{5} + 360\ (2t + 1)$, with $y$ and $t$ rational integers. Thus, every rational integer prime to $6$ is a sum of $9$ fifth powers of rational integers. Thus every odd rational integer $n$ is a sum of $10$ fifth powers of rational integers. (If $n$ is prime to $3$, it results a fortiori from the preceding fact. If $n$ is divisible by $3$, $n - 2^{5}$ is a sum of $9$ fifth powers by the preceding fact.) Also, every even rational integer $n$ is the sum of $10$ fifth powers of rational integers. (Indeed, $n - 1^{5}$ or $n - 3^{5}$ is prime to $6$ and is thus a sum of $9$ fifth powers of rational integers by a preceding fact.) Thus every rational integer is a sum of $10$ fifth powers of rational integers. My question is : can this result be improved, in other words : is it proven that every rational integer is the sum of $9$ fifth powers of rational integers ? Thanks in advance for the answers.","We have the polynomial identity $360\ (2X + 1) = (X+1)^{5} + (X+4)^{5} + (-X -3)^{5} + (-X -3)^{5} - (X-2)^{5} - (X-2)^{5} + (X-3)^{5} + X^{5}.$ Thus, every rational integer that is the product of $360$ by an odd rational integer is the sum of $8$ fifth powers of rational integers.

99,"Prove that if $P(n) = P(m)$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$, then $n = m$","Prove that if  for positive integers  and , then",P(n) = P(m) m n n = m,"Let the product of the positive divisors of a positive integer $n$ be denoted by $P(n)$. Prove that if $P(n) = P(m)$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$, then $n = m$. We know that the product of the positive divisors of an integer $n$ is $n^{d(n)/2}$ where $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Thus, $n^{d(n)/2} = m^{d(m)/2}$ and so $n^{d(n)} = m^{d(m)}$. Then both $n$ and $m$ must have the same prime divisors and so we can let $$n = p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_n^{\alpha_n} \quad \text{and} \quad m = p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2} \cdots p_n^{\beta_n}.$$ Note that $d(n) = (\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1) \cdots (\alpha_n+1)$ and $d(m) = (\beta_1+1)(\beta_2+1) \cdots (\beta_n+1)$ and so we need $$\alpha_i(\alpha_1+1)(\alpha_2+1) \cdots (\alpha_n+1) = \beta_i(\beta_1+1)(\beta_2+1) \cdots (\beta_n+1)$$ for each $i$.
