2,Solving an equation including $e^{-x}$ with the Lambert W function,Solving an equation including  with the Lambert W function,e^{-x},"Given two functions of $x$, namely $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, where $$f(x)=x^2-4x+8$$$$g(x)=3xe^{-x}$$ the shortest distance between the graphs of the functions is sought. I begin by defining a function $h(x)$ which returns the vertical distance between the functions, $h(x)=f(x)-g(x)$. Then I locate the global minimum by solving $h'(x)=0$, which I solve numerically and get $x\approx 1.802$, which is what I wanted. However, I wish to solve this algebraically.

Is it possible to isolate the terms in such a way, or do I have a transcendental equation?
