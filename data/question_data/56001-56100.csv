If we presume that there exists an odd perfect number $n$ , then since the Euler's totient function satisfies $$\varphi(n)=n\cdot\prod_{p\mid n}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right),$$ then denoting with $\operatorname{rad}(m)=\prod_{p\mid m}p$ the radical of an integer $m\geq 1$ with $\operatorname{rad}(1)=1$ , and $\sigma(m)=\sum_{d\mid m}d$ then sum of divisors function we get that our odd perfect number satisifies $$2\varphi(n)\operatorname{rad}(n)=\sigma(n)\varphi(\operatorname{rad}(n)).$$ That is, our odd perfect number satisifies $$\varphi(n)\operatorname{rad}(n)=n\varphi(\operatorname{rad}(n))\tag{1}$$ and we conclude that our odd perfect number $n$ satisfies by application of the Fermat's little theorem $$2^{n\varphi(\operatorname{rad}(n))}\equiv 1\text{ mod }n,\tag{2}$$ and $$2^{\operatorname{rad}(n)\varphi(n)}\equiv 1\text{ mod }\operatorname{rad}(n).\tag{3}$$ Question 1.

Critic Ivor Smallbrain has been keeping a careful account of the number of chocolate bars he has eaten during film screenings over his career. For each positive integer $n$ he denotes by $a_n$ the total number of bars he consumed during the first n films. One evening, during a screening of the Christmas epic It's a Wonderful Proof , he notices that the sequence $a_1 , a_2 , ...$ obeys the following rules for all $ n => 1$: $a_{n+1} > a_n $ $a_{a_n} = 3n$ Also $a_1 > 0$ (a) Find $a_1$ .

(a) Well, we would be good to make use of the hint, so that $a_x = a_{a_1} = 3$ by the second property. Now, let us say that x is greater than or equal to four. As the sequence is strictly increasing, the terms before $a_x$ are strictly decreasing, thus we would run out of terms if this were the case. Hence x must be less than 4, so x is 1,2 or 3, remembering that the first term of the sequence is at least one. Well, suppose that x is 1. Then we get $a_1 = a_x = a_{a_1} = 3$, an absurdity. So, we investigate if x is 3. Then $a_3 = a_x = a_{a_1} = 3$ Yet we recall x is $a_1$ and the sequence is strictly increasing, so this is an absurdity. (b) Knowing that $a_1 = 2$ we note $3 = a_{a_1} = a_2$ by the second property. Similarly, $6=a_{a_2}=a_3$ so $9 = a_{a_3} = a_6$. Now, we are looking for $a_5$ and $a_4$, but this is made easy by the first property; the sequence is increasing, and the third term is 6, the sixth term is 9. Hence the fourth is 7 and the fifth 8.

I'd like to point out that I'm not cheating on any contest by posting this problem (e.g. the OTIS). It was released in the past to help students prepare for the Putnam competition.

My first instinct is to try to guess a formula for $a_n$ that can hopefully be easily proven via induction. Alternatively one may be able to prove some useful properties about the sequence using induction. We have $\lfloor \sqrt{a_n}\rfloor = k\Leftrightarrow k^2 \leq a_n \leq k^2 + 2k.$ Computing the first few terms of the sequence gives $1,2,3,4,6,8,10,13,16,20,24,28,33,38.$ But there doesn't seem to be any noticeable pattern that can lead to a general formula. However, observing the perfect squares in the sequence, we see that the only two seen so far are $4$ and $16$ . It might not just be a coincidence that these are both powers of 4 (1). Then it might be useful to consider the number of times $\lfloor \sqrt{a_n}\rfloor$ occurs. The sequence $\lfloor \sqrt{a_n}\rfloor$ is as follows: $1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6$ .

For a subset $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and a series of positive real numbers $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ , I'll use the notation $\sum_A a_n$ as a shorthand for $\sum_{n\in A} a_n$ .

Background : Fix a series of positive terms $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ .  Given a subset $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ , call it $a_n$ -small if $\sum_A a_n$ converges.  The following proposition is easy to prove: Proposition :  The set $\{A\subseteq \mathbb{N}: A\text{ is } a_n\text{-small}\}\cup \{\mathbb{N}\}$ is a topology of closed sets on $\mathbb{N}$ . I will use the notation $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ to refer to this topology.  Then one can ask how topological properties of $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ are related to series properties of $\sum a_n$ .  For example, I can show: Proposition :  The following are equivalent. $\sum a_n$ converges. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is discrete. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is disconnected. $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is Hausdorff And there are other nice things.  For example, $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is compact iff $(\mathbb{N},a_n)$ is cofinite iff $\liminf a_n > 0$ . With this language, my question can be reformulated as... Are $\left(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{n}\right)$ and $\left(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)$ homeomorphic? I have made very little progress on this.  Of course, the identity function $i:(\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})\rightarrow (\mathbb{N}, \frac{1}{n})$ is a continuous bijection, but the inverse map is not continuous.  Also, if there is such a bijection, there there is such a bijection with agrees with $i$ on any preassigned finite set.

Please offer any comments on what I could do better/formatting tips, and point out any logical errors, no matter how small. Thanks! We need to prove that $e$ is irrational. We proceed to prove by contradiction. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist integers $p$ , $q$ such that $p$ and $q$ are integers. We first prove that $e$ cannot be an integer by using the fact that $$e=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}$$ We see that $$1+\frac{1}{1!}<1+\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{1}{2!}+\ldots<1+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^n}$$ since it can be shown that $n!>2^n$ for all $n>3$ . This means that $2<e<3$ and thus $e$ cannot be an integer. This means that $q\neq 1$ . Since $e=p/q$ , we can write $$\frac{p}{q}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}$$ If we multiply both sides by $q!$ , we notice that we get $$p(q-1)!=q!\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}=\sum_{n=0}^{q}\frac{q!}{n!}+\sum_{n=q+1}^{\infty}\frac{q!}{n!}$$ We notice that since $p$ and $q$ are integers, the left side must be an integer. Now, looking at the right side, we see that the first term is an integer, since every factor in the denominator cancels out with some factor in $q!$ , since $n\leq q$ in the first term. However, the right sum simplifies to $$\sum_{n=q+1}^{\infty}\frac{q!}{n!}=\frac{1}{q+1}+\frac{1}{(q+1)(q+2)}+\cdots<\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(q+1)^k}$$ We see that this is an infinite geometric series with sum $$\frac{\frac{1}{q+1}}{1-\frac{1}{q+1}}=\frac{1}{q}$$ and since $q\neq 1$ , we see that this sum must be less than $1$ , so it cannot be an integer.

You can read it here . I am looking for a solution where $f(z)\geq 0$ and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(z) dz = 1$ . I believe there is only one solution. That solution also satisfies $f(z) = f(-z)$ and $f(0) = f(-1) = f(1)$ . In fact $f$ is the density of $Z$ , with $$ Z= X_1 + X_1 X_2 + X_1 X_2 X_3 +\cdots $$ with the $X_i$ 's being i.i.d with the following distribution: $$P(X_i= -1) = P(X_i =-0.5) = P(X_i = 0.5) = P(X_i = 1) = 0.25.$$ We also have $$E(Z^k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} z^k  f(z) dz = \frac{1}{2} \Big(1+ \frac{1}{2^k}\Big) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (1+z)^k f(z)dz$$ if $k$ is even, or zero otherwise. Note that the characteristic function of $Z$ satisfies $$\frac{d^k \psi_Z}{dt^k}(0) = \frac{d^k E(\exp it Z)}{dt^k}(0)= i^k E(Z^k).$$ The reason why I am interested in this problem can be found here . The empirical percentile distribution of $Z$ is pictured below: Update This is a particular case of a more general problem: solving $F_Z = F_{g(X,Z)}$ where $g$ is any function, $F$ represents the distribution associated with the density $f$ , and $X, Z$ are independent random variables. In this case, $g(X,Z) = X(1+Z)$ . Another case involving $g(X, Z) = \sqrt{X+Z}$ was discussed here . Despite the smooth appearance of $F_Z$ , it is possible that $F_Z$ is nowhere differentiable. Similar distributions have been analyzed by David Bailey in his book Experimental Mathematics in Action , published in 2007. In particular, sections 5.2 and 5.3 (pages 114-137) are very relevant to this context. One of the densities he has studied, namely $2qf(x) = f(\frac{x-1}{q}) + f(\frac{x+1}{q})$ , is very similar to the one I posted on Math.Stackexchange, here , leading to the same discussion as to when it is smooth or not, an unsolved problem in many (but not all) cases. All these problems end up in some functional equations like the one discussed in this question. A possible way to find a numerical solution is as follows. Build a sequence of densities $f_n$ that are piecewise uniform on the support domain, starting in this very particular case with $f_1(x) = \frac{1}{2}$ if $x\in [-1, 1]$ and $f_1(x) = 0$ otherwise. In fact, it's quite possible that $f$ is constant on $[-1, 1]$ based on empirical evidence. Each $f_n$ must satisfy $f_n(x) \geq 0, f_n(x) = f_n(-x)$ , and $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx = 1$ . Of course this assumes that the density exists, and that the solution satisfying these constraints is unique. It also assumes that the algorithm in question converges to the solution. For instance, $f_n$ might be defined using $n$ intervals $I_{n1}, \cdots, I_{nn}$ , with $f_n(x) = c_{nk}$ constant $(k=1,\cdots,n)$ if $x\in I_{nk}$ . The intervals $I_{nk}$ 's and the constants $c_{nk}$ 's are chosen so as to minimize some error criterion $E_n$ , for instance $$E_n = \sup |F_{Z}^{(n)}(x) - F_{g(X,Z)}^{(n)}(x)| \mbox{ or } E_n = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |F_{Z}^{(n)}(x) - F_{g(X,Z)}^{(n)}(x)| dx.$$ Here $F^{(n)}$ is the distribution attached to $f_n$ . Techniques about how to solve this problem are described in my article New Perspectives on Statistical Distributions and Deep Learning . I will add an illustration in the next few days, if I find the time.","Final update on 11/29/2019: I have worked on this a bit more, and wrote an article summarizing all the main findings.

Note that the characteristic function of satisfies The reason why I am interested in this problem can be found here . The empirical percentile distribution of is pictured below: Update This is a particular case of a more general problem: solving where is any function, represents the distribution associated with the density , and are independent random variables. In this case, . Another case involving was discussed here . Despite the smooth appearance of , it is possible that is nowhere differentiable. Similar distributions have been analyzed by David Bailey in his book Experimental Mathematics in Action , published in 2007. In particular, sections 5.2 and 5.3 (pages 114-137) are very relevant to this context. One of the densities he has studied, namely , is very similar to the one I posted on Math.Stackexchange, here , leading to the same discussion as to when it is smooth or not, an unsolved problem in many (but not all) cases. All these problems end up in some functional equations like the one discussed in this question. A possible way to find a numerical solution is as follows. Build a sequence of densities that are piecewise uniform on the support domain, starting in this very particular case with if and otherwise. In fact, it's quite possible that is constant on based on empirical evidence. Each must satisfy , and . Of course this assumes that the density exists, and that the solution satisfying these constraints is unique. It also assumes that the algorithm in question converges to the solution. For instance, might be defined using intervals , with constant if . The intervals 's and the constants 's are chosen so as to minimize some error criterion , for instance Here is the distribution attached to .

Given $(3)$ holds, $(4)$ may be replaced with the equivalent \begin{equation}\lim_{i} \left|1-\frac{a_{n_i+1}}{a_{n_i}} \frac{a_{n_i-1}}{a_{n_i}}\right|^{1/n_i} =1 \end{equation} So this suggests that $\dfrac{a_{n_i+1}}{a_{n_i}} \dfrac{a_{n_i-1}}{a_{n_i}}$ must be ""small"" enough. It seems somehow related to the ratio test vs the root test in convergence of series. What I expect A proof (or a counter-example) is of course appreciated, but I also want to know the origin of this problem (in what literature did it emerge).

Long version: Recall that for any sequence $a\in\ell_1+\ell_2$, we can defined the K-functional (between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2)$ as the concave, non-decreasing function $\kappa_p\colon(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ $$ \kappa_p(t) = \inf\{ \lVert u\rVert_1+t\lVert v\rVert_2 : u\in\ell_1, v\in\ell_2\text{ s.t. } u+v=p\} $$ (see e.g. this previous question for more properties). It is also known (for the continuous case $L_1+L_2$, but I am pretty sure the proof extends to the discrete case) that for any given $t>0$ an optimal decomposition $(u_t,v_t)$ yiedling the value $\kappa_p(t)$ is of the form (assuming wlog that $a\geq 0$) $$ v_t = \min(a, \lambda_t), \qquad u_t = a-v $$ for some threshold $\lambda_t \geq 0$. This being said, I have been repeatedly failing to find a tight enough (possibly asymptotic with regard to $n$) expression for $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$, where $(p_n)_n$ is a sequence of probability distributions defined as $$ p_n(k) \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \frac{1}{c_n}\cdot \frac{1}{(k+1)\ln(k+1)}, \qquad 1\leq k\leq n-1 $$ and $0$ for $k\geq n$; where $c_n \stackrel{\rm def}{=}\sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k\ln k}$ is a normalizing constant satisfying $c_n = \ln\ln n - K+o(1)$ for some constant $K$ (which can be found, e.g., via Euler—MacLaurin). More specifically, my end goal would be to find an asymptotic equivalent (or even expansion to lower order terms) to the value $t^\ast(n,\varepsilon)$ solution of the equation   $$  \kappa_{p_n}(t) = 1-2\varepsilon \tag{1} $$   where $\varepsilon \in (0,1/2)$ is to be thought of as a small constant. I tried to tackle that by (i) finding an expression or sufficiently good asymptotic expansion of $\lVert u_\lambda\rVert_1+t\lVert v_\lambda\rVert_2$ (for fixed $t$, as a function of $\lambda$), (ii) minimizing this w.r.t. $\lambda$ to find an expression (or sufficiently good asymptotic expansion) of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$; and (iii) solve (1) approximately using the expression of (ii) in lieu of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$. However, I was stuck at (i) for the discrete case; trying to consider the $L_1+L_2$ analog instead (continuous case) for a start, I got stuck at either (ii) or (iii) -- I am unclear which, as repeating the computations kept giving me either different results or nonsense. Any clue, idea, or suggestion on what I could do (or what the ""right"" approach and answer are)? Additional: The answer to $(\dagger)$ (and of (1)), even though not to the more general question of the asymptotic of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$, should satisfy $$ e^{(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c'\varepsilon}} \leq \kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon) \leq e^{(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c\varepsilon}} \tag{2} $$ where $c,c'>0$ are absolute constants; leading me to conjecture that $\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon) = e^{(1+o(1))(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c\varepsilon}}$ for asome absolute constant $c>0$. The reason for (2) is rather long-winded, but basically follows from a distribution testing question. [VV14] and [BCG17] both established bounds on the complexity $\Phi$ of a specific problem (""identity testing""), which for arbitrary discrete distribution $p$ and $\varepsilon \in(0,1]$ are respectively $$ \Omega\left(\frac{\lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon}\rVert_{2/3}}{\varepsilon^2}\right)\leq \Phi(p,\varepsilon) \leq O\left(\frac{\lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon/16}\rVert_{2/3}}{\varepsilon^2}\right) \tag{3} $$ and $$ \Omega\left(\frac{\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}\right)\leq \Phi(p,\varepsilon) \leq O\left(\frac{\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{9})}{\varepsilon^2}\right). \tag{4} $$  Without delving into exactly what the functional $p\mapsto \lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon}\rVert_{2/3}$ in (3) is (it is the $2/3$-norm of a vector obtained from $p$), computing its asymptotics for $(p_n)_n$ is easier than that of $\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon)$. By doing so (assuming I didn't make a mistake in the computation), and putting together the inequalities (3) and (4), we get the inequalities from (2). [VV14] Gregory Valiant and Paul Valiant.

In IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (CCC), 2017.","Short version: For any $n\in\mathbb{N}$, Let $$ p_n(k) \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \frac{1}{(k+1)\ln(k+1)}, \qquad 1\leq k\leq n-1 $$ and consider $$ \kappa_{p_n}(t) = \inf\{ \lVert u\rVert_1+t\lVert v\rVert_2 : u\in\ell_1, v\in\ell_2\text{ s.t. } u+v=p_n\} $$ For a fixed small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, what is the asymptotic expression (as $n\to\infty)$ of $t=t(n,\varepsilon)$ such that $$\kappa_{p_n}(t) =(1-2\varepsilon)\sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k\ln k} \tag{$\dagger$} $$? Long version: Recall that for any sequence $a\in\ell_1+\ell_2$, we can defined the K-functional (between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2)$ as the concave, non-decreasing function $\kappa_p\colon(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ $$ \kappa_p(t) = \inf\{ \lVert u\rVert_1+t\lVert v\rVert_2 : u\in\ell_1, v\in\ell_2\text{ s.t. } u+v=p\} $$ (see e.g. this previous question for more properties). It is also known (for the continuous case $L_1+L_2$, but I am pretty sure the proof extends to the discrete case) that for any given $t>0$ an optimal decomposition $(u_t,v_t)$ yiedling the value $\kappa_p(t)$ is of the form (assuming wlog that $a\geq 0$) $$ v_t = \min(a, \lambda_t), \qquad u_t = a-v $$ for some threshold $\lambda_t \geq 0$. This being said, I have been repeatedly failing to find a tight enough (possibly asymptotic with regard to $n$) expression for $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$, where $(p_n)_n$ is a sequence of probability distributions defined as $$ p_n(k) \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \frac{1}{c_n}\cdot \frac{1}{(k+1)\ln(k+1)}, \qquad 1\leq k\leq n-1 $$ and $0$ for $k\geq n$; where $c_n \stackrel{\rm def}{=}\sum_{k=2}^n \frac{1}{k\ln k}$ is a normalizing constant satisfying $c_n = \ln\ln n - K+o(1)$ for some constant $K$ (which can be found, e.g., via Euler—MacLaurin). More specifically, my end goal would be to find an asymptotic equivalent (or even expansion to lower order terms) to the value $t^\ast(n,\varepsilon)$ solution of the equation   $$  \kappa_{p_n}(t) = 1-2\varepsilon \tag{1} $$   where $\varepsilon \in (0,1/2)$ is to be thought of as a small constant. I tried to tackle that by (i) finding an expression or sufficiently good asymptotic expansion of $\lVert u_\lambda\rVert_1+t\lVert v_\lambda\rVert_2$ (for fixed $t$, as a function of $\lambda$), (ii) minimizing this w.r.t. $\lambda$ to find an expression (or sufficiently good asymptotic expansion) of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$; and (iii) solve (1) approximately using the expression of (ii) in lieu of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$. However, I was stuck at (i) for the discrete case; trying to consider the $L_1+L_2$ analog instead (continuous case) for a start, I got stuck at either (ii) or (iii) -- I am unclear which, as repeating the computations kept giving me either different results or nonsense. Any clue, idea, or suggestion on what I could do (or what the ""right"" approach and answer are)? Additional: The answer to $(\dagger)$ (and of (1)), even though not to the more general question of the asymptotic of $\kappa_{p_n}(t)$, should satisfy $$ e^{(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c'\varepsilon}} \leq \kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon) \leq e^{(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c\varepsilon}} \tag{2} $$ where $c,c'>0$ are absolute constants; leading me to conjecture that $\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon) = e^{(1+o(1))(\ln n)^{\frac{1}{2}-c\varepsilon}}$ for asome absolute constant $c>0$. The reason for (2) is rather long-winded, but basically follows from a distribution testing question. [VV14] and [BCG17] both established bounds on the complexity $\Phi$ of a specific problem (""identity testing""), which for arbitrary discrete distribution $p$ and $\varepsilon \in(0,1]$ are respectively $$ \Omega\left(\frac{\lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon}\rVert_{2/3}}{\varepsilon^2}\right)\leq \Phi(p,\varepsilon) \leq O\left(\frac{\lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon/16}\rVert_{2/3}}{\varepsilon^2}\right) \tag{3} $$ and $$ \Omega\left(\frac{\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}\right)\leq \Phi(p,\varepsilon) \leq O\left(\frac{\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-\frac{\varepsilon}{9})}{\varepsilon^2}\right). \tag{4} $$  Without delving into exactly what the functional $p\mapsto \lVert p^{-\max}_{-\varepsilon}\rVert_{2/3}$ in (3) is (it is the $2/3$-norm of a vector obtained from $p$), computing its asymptotics for $(p_n)_n$ is easier than that of $\kappa_{p_n}^{-1}(1-2\varepsilon)$. By doing so (assuming I didn't make a mistake in the computation), and putting together the inequalities (3) and (4), we get the inequalities from (2). [VV14] Gregory Valiant and Paul Valiant.

Otherwise the same kind of recurrence. Proof given by Jeffrey Shallit via email: OK, now I see. You wrote ""k"" before when you talked about the k    previous terms, and you   really meant ""k-1"" previous terms. Just to let you know: you should have written t(n,k) = (sum from i = 1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k-1)) - (sum from i = 1 to k-1    of t(n-i,k)) Here's the proof. Now (sum from i=1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k-1)) is just the number of elements in   {n-k+1,...,n-1) that are divisible by k-1. This is always equal to 1,    because in k-1 consecutive   integers, exactly one will be divisible by k-1. On the other hand, (sum from i = 1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k)) is equal to    either 0 or 1, because in   k-1 consecutive integers, either 0 or 1 of them are divisible by k.    We get 1 except if   all are not divisible by k, which means the next integer /is/ divisible    by k, and the next integer is n. What I have found experimentally is a relationship between; $$A_T(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n} T(n,k)$$ and; $$a_t(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n} t(n,k)$$ when; $x \geq 1$ $y \geq 0$ or; $x \leq -2$ $y \leq -2$ $$a_t(n) \;\; \sim \;\; \frac{A_T(n)}{c}$$ where: $$c = \left(\prod _{n=2}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{A_T(n)}}\right)$$ Put together: $$a_t(n) \;\; \sim \;\; \frac{A_T(n)}{\left(\prod _{n=2}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{A_T(n)}}\right)}$$ Works also for $x$ and $y$ as some complex numbers but I have not studied for what ranges of complex number it is valid. Taking the difference between the left hand side ($a_t(n)$) and the right side (the approximation $\frac{A_T(n)}{c}$) I have found, and this is the question: Is the ratio between the consecutive terms: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{a_t(n)-\frac{A_T(n)}{c}}{a_t(n-1)-\frac{A_T(n-1)}{c}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left((y+1)+\sqrt{(y+1)^2+4}\right)$$ when $y \geq 1$ and $x=1$?

93,Evaluating the alternating hyperbolic series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k \sinh (\pi k)}$,Evaluating the alternating hyperbolic series,\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k \sinh (\pi k)},"You can evaluate the alternating hyperbolic series $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k^{2n-1} \sinh (\pi k)}$$ for any positive even value of $n$ by integrating the function $$\frac{\pi \csc (\pi z)}{z^{2n-1} \sinh (\pi z)}$$ around a square contour that avoids the poles on both the real and imaginary axes. For example, $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k^{3} \sinh (\pi k)} = - \frac{\pi^3}{360} $$ and $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k^{7} \sinh (\pi k)} = - \frac{13 \pi^7}{453,600}. $$ However, if you try that same thing for a positive odd value of $n$ ,  the residues inside of the contour cancel each other, and you're left with the trivial equation $0=0$ .
