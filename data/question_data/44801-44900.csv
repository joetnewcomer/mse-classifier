I was hoping I could get some feedback on this proof, as I'm still fairly new to this level of proof writing. Thanks! Here's the exercise: Let $G$ be an Abelian group whose operation is multiplication, let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, and let $K = \{x \in G:$ for some positive integer $ n$, $x^n \in H \}$. Prove that $K$ is a subgroup of $G$. My proof: To show that $K$ is a subgroup of $G$, it is sufficient to show that $K$ is a subset of $G$ and that $K$ is closed under multiplication and inverses. The first condition is trivially satisfied, because $K$ consists only of elements of $G$. We now show that $K$ is closed under multiplication. Let $x,y \in K$. We know $x,y \in G$ and $x^n,y^m \in H$ for some positive integers $m,n$. Additionally, $x^m,y^n \in H$. Since $x,y \in G$ and $G$ is closed under multiplication, $x \cdot y \in G$. Similarly, $x^n \cdot x^m \cdot y^n \cdot y^m \in H$. Now $(x \cdot y)^{n+m} = \underbrace{(x \cdot y) \cdot (x \cdot y) \cdots (x\cdot y)}_\text{n+m}$. Since $G$ is Abelian, we can rearrange this as $\underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{n+m} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{n+m} \\ = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{n} \cdot \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{m} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{n} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{m} = x^n \cdot x^m \cdot y^n \cdot y^m \in H$. Therefore, since $x \cdot y \in G$, $n+m$ is a positive integer, and $(x \cdot y)^{n+m} \in H$, $x \cdot y \in K$. Therefore, $K$ is closed with respect to multiplication. Now we prove that $K$ is closed with respect to inverses. Let $x \in K$. Therefore $x \in G$ and $x^n \in H$ for some positive integer $n$. Since $x \in G$ and $G$ is closed to inverses, $\frac{1}{x} \in G$. Similarly, $\frac{1}{x^n} \in H$. $(\frac{1}{x})^n = \frac{1}{x^n} \in H$.

97,How can the inverse map be a morphism of algebraic varieties?,How can the inverse map be a morphism of algebraic varieties?,,"This is a very basic questions about algebraic groups, which I'm just starting to learn a little bit about: For an algebraic variety to be an algebraic group, the inverse map needs to be a morphism of algebraic varieties, but I don't see how this can be true. My understanding is that morphisms are locally polynomials. Specifically, I'm working on a problem involving the multiplicative group of the affine line, but I don't see how the inverse map is a morphism of the variety given that it's not a polynomial.","This is a very basic questions about algebraic groups, which I'm just starting to learn a little bit about: For an algebraic variety to be an algebraic group, the inverse map needs to be a morphism of algebraic varieties, but I don't see how this can be true.

I had the following doubt: Show that the element $2\otimes 1$ is $0$ in $\mathbb Z\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ but not a zero in $2\mathbb Z\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$. I was able to prove $2\otimes 1$ is $0$ in $\mathbb Z\otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ by shifting $2$ using tensor property . now I can't see how to prove it's non-zero in $2\mathbb Z\otimes_{\mathbb Z} \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$. kindly help out.,This question already has an answer here : how to prove an element is non-zero in a tensor-product (1 answer) Closed 8 years ago .
