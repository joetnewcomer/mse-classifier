0,Combinatorial puzzle reminiscent of knapsack problem. Is this classic?,Combinatorial puzzle reminiscent of knapsack problem. Is this classic?,,"I have $n$ red integers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ (not necessarily distinct), all with $1\leq a_i\leq n$. I also have $n$ blue integers $b_1,\ldots,b_n$ with same constraints. I want to show that there is a (red) subset of the $a_i$'s and a blue subset of the $b_j$'s that add up to the same value. I.e. that there exist two non-empty subsets $I,J\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\sum_{i\in I}a_i = \sum_{j\in J}b_j$. This is obvious if $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_n$ and $b_1=b_2=\cdots=b_n$ and it seems that allowing the $a_i$'s and the $b_j$'s to be distinct only give me more opportunities for the existence of matching subsets but I did not manage to find a proof (or a counter-example?). At the moment the best I can prove is: if the $a_i$'s and $b_j$'s are all $\leq \frac{n}{2}$ then a solution exists and one can even find a solution where $I,J$ are convex subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ (i.e., they are subintervals). The solution is found by a greedy algorithm that runs in linear-time.

1,Number of Dyck Paths that touch the diagonal exactly $k$ times?,Number of Dyck Paths that touch the diagonal exactly  times?,k,"What is the number of Dyck Ppaths from $(0,0)$ to $(n,n)$ which touch the diagonal exactly $k$ times?

7,TicTacToe State Space Choose Calculation,TicTacToe State Space Choose Calculation,,"I understand there are numerous questions around the internet about the state space of tic-tac-toe but I have a feeling they've usually got it wrong.

Common Over Estimates: Over Estimate One: First some common answers to the number of possible states in Tic-Tac-Toe: $9! = 362880$ This is one solution, which is overstates the upper-bound by the most I have seen, as it includes states such as: x1|o2| --------   |  | --------   |  | as well as: x2|o1| --------   |  | --------   |  | and all the other sequences of combinations possible. (Thank you to Exodus5 for pointing out the error.) Over Estimate Two: Another common answer that is better, common, but still over-estimating is: $3^9 = 19683$ Which is better. Now we only count the following board once... x|x|x ----- x|x|x ----- x|x|x but I've still never heard of any type of one-player tic-tac-toe and it seems boring.

The Power of Choose: After sitting down and thinking for awhile I came up with a formula that does a more precise job at estimating the state space of tic-tac-toe and it is quite simple, but still not 100% as it still overestimates. $9 \choose 1$ * $8 \choose 0$ + $9 \choose 1$ * $8 \choose 1$ + $9 \choose 2$ * $7 \choose 1$ + $9 \choose 2$ * $7 \choose 2$ + $9 \choose 3$ * $6 \choose 2$ + $9 \choose 3$ * $6 \choose 3$ + $9 \choose 4$ * $5 \choose 3$ + $9 \choose 4$ * $5 \choose 4$ + $9 \choose 5$ * $4 \choose 4$ = 9+72+252+756+1260+1680+1260+630+127 = 6046 Edit: The final term above I had $4 \choose 5$ but the correct value is $4 \choose 4$ which yields the missing 1 from Immanuel's solution. Essentially each term of $9 \choose X$ is placing the X's on the board, then the $K \choose L$ is the O's choosing the appropriate number of places from the remaining open spaces on the board. Each term being added is the number of states being generated at each turn. So for turn 1 we have 9 states, for turn 2, 72 states and so on. The main point here is 6046 is far fewer than the other estimations, the use of Choose seems rather elegant considering its simplicity and the accuracy we are able to achieve, and lastly I like how each term being added correlates to each turn. I recognize that it is not perfect, as I am ignoring some win conditions, i.e. this board is also counted: x|x|x ----- x|o|o ----- x|o|o Which isn't a legitimate board but still 6045 is less than $1/3$ of the commonly stated $3^9$ and isn't the equation rather beautiful? The Question: The question is, does this application of choose accurately represent how X's and O's can alternatively be placed on a 3x3 grid? Have I missed anything? Bonus question: Any insights on how to estimate the number of illegitimate boards during moves 6, 7, 8, and 9? Note: With 5 or fewer moves, all boards generated are legitimate. The goal is not to have a computer brute force the thinking for us, but to gain a deeper understanding of the distribution of win conditions.

I recognize that it is not perfect, as I am ignoring some win conditions, i.e. this board is also counted: x|x|x ----- x|o|o ----- x|o|o Which isn't a legitimate board but still 6045 is less than $1/3$ of the commonly stated $3^9$ and isn't the equation rather beautiful? The Question: The question is, does this application of choose accurately represent how X's and O's can alternatively be placed on a 3x3 grid? Have I missed anything? Bonus question: Any insights on how to estimate the number of illegitimate boards during moves 6, 7, 8, and 9? Note: With 5 or fewer moves, all boards generated are legitimate. The goal is not to have a computer brute force the thinking for us, but to gain a deeper understanding of the distribution of win conditions.

20,Partitioning a multiset into multisets of fixed sizes,Partitioning a multiset into multisets of fixed sizes,,"Say we have a multiset $S(\mathbf{d}$) where $\mathbf{d}$ is a list of $l$ numbers and the multiplicity of the $i$th element of $S$ is $d_i$. The cardinality $N$ of $S$ is $\sum d_i$. We want to partition $S$ into $m$ multisets of size $k_i$ respectively, so that $\sum k_i = \sum d_i = N$. How many ways can we do this? In my mind this is a generalization of the multinomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ representing the number of ways to partition a set of $n=\sum k_i$ objects into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$, to a sort of number like $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ or $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{k}}$ representing the number of ways to partition a multiset of $n=\sum k_i = \sum d_i$ into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$. There are a few special cases that are simpler to calculate: If $m=1$, then clearly $k_1 = N$ and you're choosing the whole multiset. So $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(N)} = 1$ If $m=2$, then you only have to handle choosing $k_1$ or $k_2$ elements from a multiset, because the rest will be the other set. So, as mentioned below, you can use a generating function and $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(k_1,k_2)}$ is equal to the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ or $x^{k_2}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1 + x^2 + \cdots + x^{d_i} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^l \frac{1-x^{d_i - 1}}{1 - x}$. But then you also need to account for the fact that order doesn't matter, which I'm not sure how to do. Like in the first example below, you would find that there are $3$ ways to choose $2$ elements, but there are only $2$ ways to split the multiset because you have to choose 2 of them that are compatible. Examples Let's say that $\mathbf{d} = (2, 2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ might be $\{a, a, b, b\}$. Let $k_1 = k_2 = 2$, so we need to find all the ways of splitting $S$ into two sub-multisets of size $2$. There are exactly $2$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a,a\},\{b,b\}\}$ and $\{\{a,b\},\{a,b\}\}$, so $\binom{(2,2)}{(2,2)} = 2$. Another example: $\mathbf{d} = (2,2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ could be $\{a,a,b,b\}$. Let $k_1 = 1$, $k_2 = 1$, and $k_3 = 2$. There are $3$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a\},\{a\},\{b,b\}\}$, $\{\{b\},\{b\},\{a,a\}\}$, and $\{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\}$. So $\binom{(2,2)}{(1,1,2)}=3$. My Attempts I've tried to figure this out two ways. The first was to find a recurrence relation and some base cases, kind of how Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the identity $S(n,k) = kS(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1)$. I tried to think about what happens if you already have a partition and want to add an element to the original multiset, but then you have to decide which bin that element will go into or whether or not to add a new bin. I also tried to derive it in the way that multinomial coefficients are derived, by counting the number of ways to fill the first bin, and then the second, and so on. The number of ways to choose $k_1$ elements from the multiset to put in the first bin can be computed by finding the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{d_i}$, which isn't explicit but it's a start. But then, depending on which elements you chose, you don't know how to adjust your multiset to reflect the remaining elements.","Say we have a multiset $S(\mathbf{d}$) where $\mathbf{d}$ is a list of $l$ numbers and the multiplicity of the $i$th element of $S$ is $d_i$. The cardinality $N$ of $S$ is $\sum d_i$. We want to partition $S$ into $m$ multisets of size $k_i$ respectively, so that $\sum k_i = \sum d_i = N$. How many ways can we do this? In my mind this is a generalization of the multinomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ representing the number of ways to partition a set of $n=\sum k_i$ objects into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$, to a sort of number like $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m}$ or $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{\mathbf{k}}$ representing the number of ways to partition a multiset of $n=\sum k_i = \sum d_i$ into $m$ bins of sizes $k_i$. There are a few special cases that are simpler to calculate: If $m=1$, then clearly $k_1 = N$ and you're choosing the whole multiset. So $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(N)} = 1$ If $m=2$, then you only have to handle choosing $k_1$ or $k_2$ elements from a multiset, because the rest will be the other set. So, as mentioned below, you can use a generating function and $\binom{\mathbf{d}}{(k_1,k_2)}$ is equal to the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ or $x^{k_2}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1 + x^2 + \cdots + x^{d_i} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^l \frac{1-x^{d_i - 1}}{1 - x}$. But then you also need to account for the fact that order doesn't matter, which I'm not sure how to do. Like in the first example below, you would find that there are $3$ ways to choose $2$ elements, but there are only $2$ ways to split the multiset because you have to choose 2 of them that are compatible. Examples Let's say that $\mathbf{d} = (2, 2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ might be $\{a, a, b, b\}$. Let $k_1 = k_2 = 2$, so we need to find all the ways of splitting $S$ into two sub-multisets of size $2$. There are exactly $2$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a,a\},\{b,b\}\}$ and $\{\{a,b\},\{a,b\}\}$, so $\binom{(2,2)}{(2,2)} = 2$. Another example: $\mathbf{d} = (2,2)$, so $S(\mathbf{d})$ could be $\{a,a,b,b\}$. Let $k_1 = 1$, $k_2 = 1$, and $k_3 = 2$. There are $3$ ways of doing this: $\{\{a\},\{a\},\{b,b\}\}$, $\{\{b\},\{b\},\{a,a\}\}$, and $\{\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\}$. So $\binom{(2,2)}{(1,1,2)}=3$. My Attempts I've tried to figure this out two ways. The first was to find a recurrence relation and some base cases, kind of how Stirling numbers of the second kind can be computed using the identity $S(n,k) = kS(n-1,k) + S(n-1,k-1)$. I tried to think about what happens if you already have a partition and want to add an element to the original multiset, but then you have to decide which bin that element will go into or whether or not to add a new bin. I also tried to derive it in the way that multinomial coefficients are derived, by counting the number of ways to fill the first bin, and then the second, and so on. The number of ways to choose $k_1$ elements from the multiset to put in the first bin can be computed by finding the coefficient of $x^{k_1}$ in $\prod\limits_{i=1}^l 1+x+x^2+\cdots+x^{d_i}$, which isn't explicit but it's a start. But then, depending on which elements you chose, you don't know how to adjust your multiset to reflect the remaining elements.",,"['combinatorics', 'set-partition', 'multisets']"

23,How to use generalized pigeonhole principle to be sure that at least one of the integers picked is even?,How to use generalized pigeonhole principle to be sure that at least one of the integers picked is even?,,"Q. How many integers from $0$ through $60$ must you pick in   order to be sure of getting at least one that is odd? at least   one that is even? Here is my verbal solution 'without using' pigeonhole principle. A. The list of integers $0,1,2...,60$ has $31$ even integers $30$ odd integers. So in order to be sure that at least one of the picked integers is odd, we must pick $32$ integers. This is because it may happen that first $31$ integers we pick turn out to be even. By similar argument, we find that if we pick $31$ integers from the list, then we are sure that at least one amongst them is even. Now I want to write this solution in terms of a function, pigeons and pigeonholes. Unfortunately the list of given integers contains total $61$ integers which is odd. Thus I can't take pigeonholes to be $\{0,1\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\},...,\{58,59\},\{60\}.$ The problem is that last element is a singleton set. I tried to use these pigeonholes as follows: Let $X$ denote the set of pigeons that are picked and $Y=\{A_1=\{0,1\},A_2= \{2,3\},A_3= \{4,5\},...,A_{30}=\{58,59\},A_{31}=\{60\}\}$ denote the set of pigeonholes. Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function such that $f(x)=A_i$ whenever $x \in A_i.$ To be sure that at least one integer is odd : Suppose that we have picked $n$ number of pigeons. Then we are through when we find the least value of $n$ such that $\lceil \frac n{31} \rceil \ge 2$ (By generalized pigeonhole principle). Observe that $n=32$ fits the bill. Also $A_{31}$ is not the pigeonhole containing at least $2$ pigeons since the set $\{60\}$ has only one element. Thus one amongst the other pigeonholes must work out and we are sure that we have found at least one odd integer. However, this argument fails when we want to be sure that at least one integer is even. How should I think about pigeons and pigeonholes here? EDIT: Should I consider different pigeonholes for the case of picking at least one even integer? Specifically I would just change $A_{30}=\{58,59\}$ to $A_{30}=\{58,59,60\}$ and rule out $A_{31}$ for this case. Then the least value of $n$ such that $\lceil \frac n{30} \rceil \ge 2$ is $n=31.$ Here even if $A_{30}$ turns out to be the pigeonhole with at least $2$ pigeons we are sure that one of the pigeons is bound to be even since this pigeonhole has only one odd number viz $59$ in it.","Q.

50,Finding the maximum number of members in the math club.,Finding the maximum number of members in the math club.,,"I asked a question few days ago which was from a local math contest in my city. The question and the solution seems interesting to me and I am interested in solving the generalization of the problem. So, the generalized problem is as follows: Professor Liyung wants to make a math club consisting of his $n$ students. But there is a problem. Each student is enemies with exactly $k$ ( $1\leq k \leq n-1$ ) students. And no one wills to be a member of the club if any of his enemies is already a member of the club. Let $M$ be the maximum number of members the club can have. Find all possible values of $M$ . (If student $A$ is an enemy with student $B$ , then student $B$ is an enemy with student $A$ . Student $A$ is not enemy with himself.) Here, $n,k$ are given numbers such that they satisfy the conditions of the problem (i.e. it is possible to draw a graph with $n$ vertices each of the vertices having degree $k$ ). Here are my workings regarding the problem: My workings I first tried for a fixed value of $k$ . And I got the following: For $k=1$ , the problem statement is true for only even $n$ . Then, $M$ has only one possible value that is $\frac n 2$ . For $k=2$ , all values of $M$ are possible in the range $[\lceil\frac n 3\rceil,\lfloor\frac n 2\rfloor]$ . (Explanation is in the link.) For $k=3$ , the upper bound of $M$ is $\lfloor \frac n 3\rfloor$ and the lower bound of $M$ is $\lceil\frac n 4\rceil$ . However, I don't have a nice argument to prove the upper bound. The proof of the lower bound is as follows: Proof: If we choose $\lceil\frac n 4\rceil -1$ students as members, then there are at most $3\lceil\frac n 4\rceil -3$ students who can't be members of the club. Then, we can choose at least $1$ students from the remaining students as a member of the club. This proves that $M$ is at least $\lceil\frac n 4\rceil$ for $k=3$ . So, I think all values of $M$ are in $[\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil,\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor]$ . The lower bound can be proved by following the similar steps as in for $k=3$ . However, I am unable to show that all values in $[\lceil\frac{n}{k+1}\rceil,\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\rfloor]$ can be a value of $M$ . I hope my thoughts are correct.

Background: A friend sent me a puzzle, which I've solved in two different ways, and I'd like to convince myself that they're algebraically the same. Specifically, I was asked to consider the following problem: Suppose we have 80 balls in a bowl of 8 different colours, with 10 of each colour. If we draw 15 of them without replacement, how many colours would we expect to see? Method 1: We can find the expected number of colours as the weighted average of the possible number of colours, with the weights being the probabilities: $\bar{k} = \sum_{k} k \cdot P_k$ . To do this we need to calculate the probabilities of seeing exactly $k$ colours for all possible values of $k$ . The probability of using just one colour is 0, as $15 > 10$ . The probability of using exactly two colours is $\binom{8}{2} \cdot \frac{\binom{20}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}}$ . The probability of using exactly at most three colours is $\binom{8}{3} \cdot \frac{\binom{30}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}}$ .This probability however includes some cases where we've picked only two colours. To get the probability of picking exactly three colours, we need to subtract these cases, giving: $\binom{8}{3} \cdot \left[\frac{\binom{30}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}} - \binom{3}{2}\frac{\binom{20}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}}\right]$ . Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the general probability of getting exactly $k$ colours is $$    P_k = (-1)^{k} \frac{\binom{8}{k}}{\binom{80}{15}} \sum_{m=2}^{k}\left(-1\right)^m \binom{k}{m}\binom{10m}{15} $$ The expected number of colours can then be written as $$ \begin{align}     \bar{k}  &= \sum_{k=2}^8k\cdot(-1)^{k} \frac{\binom{8}{k}}{\binom{80}{15}} \sum_{m=2}^{k}\left(-1\right)^m \binom{k}{m}\binom{10m}{15}\\     &= \sum_{m=2}^{8} \left(-1\right)^m \frac{\binom{10m}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}} \sum_{k=m}^8k\cdot(-1)^{k} \binom{8}{k} \binom{k}{m}. \end{align}  $$ Method 2 Alternatively, I reasoned that for any given colour, the probability of having that colour in the draw is $P_{\mathrm{c}} = 1 - \frac{\binom{70}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}}$ . If the colour is included, it contributes 1 to the total number of colours, and if not, it contributes 0. The expected value of the number of colours is then $$     \bar{k} = \sum_{\mathrm{colours}} P_{\mathrm{c}} = 8 - 8 \frac{\binom{70}{15}}{\binom{80}{15}} $$ I can calculate both of these numbers, and for this particular case, they are the same. What I'd like is to understand why they should be equal in general -- there's nothing in the derivations which limits us to 8 colours, 10 balls of each colour and 15 picks.

Combinatorics, is definitely not about counting anymore, but arguably someone declares that the most funny stuff in it has to do with counting problems (because those sort of problems have more intuition I guess). So my question has to do with that; Could you give me please an instance of application of Combinatorial Species in Enumerative combinatorics? Any other example of application is welcome too of course! Last comment: I ain't have problem with it becuse its definition or significance. I'm looking for an intuitive approach of the aforementioned notion (I mentioned the latter, because I want to avoid any possible duplication with other possibly related question on MSE, because I think checked them all and not such an answer/question has been showed up. If such a duplication does exist with an answer though, please feel free to mention it!) Thank you!",,"['combinatorics', 'category-theory']"

Heuristic explanation: edges correspond to “elementary switches” and the most natural transformation one can do to a Dyck path is to switch RU<->UR (R standing for a step right, U — for a step up, naturally); let's mark the place of switches by diagonal steps — now we get Schröder paths (small Schröder paths, actually: diagonal steps can't lie on the main diagonal — or the “UR end” of the switch would intersect the main diagonal).

Every time the teacher notices a girl having more apples than both of her neighbours combined, the teacher takes away one apple from that girl and gives one apple each to her neighbours. Prove that, this process stops after a finite number of steps. (Assume that, the teacher has an abundant supply of apples.) MY ANSWER: We define the girls as gears. Now, let any gear which has more number of apples than it's immediate neighboring gears rotate clockwise, and consequently the neighbors rotate counterclockwise.. (Note: The gears rotate only in groups of $3$ and the rotation of any group does not affect the other groups) Any clockwise rotation decreases the number of apples by $1$ and any counter rotation increases the number by $1$ . We define, a group of $3$ gears to be in a stationary state if the gear that is trapped on both the sides has $\leq$ number of apples than the sum of its neighboring gears. In such a case, the group does not rotate, and remains stationary.. Now, firstly, since we are considering positive integers, any group must come to a stationary state after finite number of rotations.. Define $\Omega_k = a_{1k}+a_{2k}+a_{3k}+....+a_{nk}$ as the sum of the number of apples in any $k^{th}$ step. Here each $a_{ik}$ denotes the number of apples possessed by the $i^{th}$ girl, at the $k^{th}$ step. Define $\Delta_k=max(a_{1k},a_{2k},.....,a_{nk})$ as the maximum number of apples possessed by some girl at any $k^{th}$ step. Say, $\Delta_0=a_j$ , for some $j\in\{1\leq{a}\leq{n}, a\in\Bbb{N}\}$ (where $\Delta_0$ represents the initial step) Define $V(a_g)$ to be the maximum number of apples possessed by some girl, which is $\leq$ girl $g$ , or in the set excluding girl $g$ . $\color{red}{Claim :}$ $\Delta_k\leq{a_j}$ , $\forall k \in \{1,2,3,......,n\}$ $\color{red}{Proof:}$ Let us start the process with the group $(a_{j-1},a_j,a_{j+1})$ .. Since, we have already proved that the number of rotations will be finite for this group to attain a stationary state. Let us say, after the $m^{th}$ step, $a_{jm}<V(a_j)$ From this step onwards until the completion of the last step (say $p$ ) of this group, $\Delta_k=V(a_j)$ , where $m\leq{k}\leq{p}$ And $\forall k<m$ , $\Delta_k$ was clearly $=a_j$ . Therefore, we see that in the whole process the value of $\Delta$ never increases.. So, following the same pattern, we can say, for any group which attains a stationary state, the value of $\Delta$ either remains same or decreases by $1$ . $\therefore \Delta_k\leq{a_j}$ , $\forall k \in \{1,2,3,......,n\}$ This completes the proof of our claim. $\blacksquare$ Hence, we can say, $\Delta_1\geq\Delta_2\geq.......\geq\Delta_n$ . This clearly proves $\Delta$ is a non-increasing function.. But, we also observe that the value of the sum $\Omega$ increases by $1$ after every step. $\Omega_{k}= a_{1k}+a_{2k}+.......+a_{nk}$ $\Omega_{k}<\Delta_{k}+\Delta_{k}+...... n$ times $\implies \Omega_{k}<n.\Delta_{k}$ . $\implies \Omega_{k}<n.\Delta_{0}$ But, $\Delta_{0}$ is a constant.. $\Omega$ increases constantly by $1$ . Hence, for this inequality to hold true, $\Omega$ cannot increase indefinitely, and therefore, the process must terminate after finite number of steps... Q.E.D. $\square$ Is my proof correct?

81,Expected Value for the Number of Parts of a Random Partition (Considering Only a Portion of the Partition Spectrum),Expected Value for the Number of Parts of a Random Partition (Considering Only a Portion of the Partition Spectrum),,"Let $n$ be a positive integer. If we take the set of all partitions of $n$ and choose a random partition from it (uniformly), then the expected value of the number of parts of this partition is a known result. The highest order term of the expected value is $\sqrt{n}\operatorname{Log}(n)$ (Kessler & Livingston, 1976). Instead of the set of all partitions of $n$ , I only want to consider $k \%$ of the total spectrum of partitions. Let $P^k(n)$ denote the set which contains $k \%$ of the total partitions of $n$ . The partitions in $P^k(n)$ are chosen as follows. We begin with the empty set and add partitions one by one. At every step we choose to add a partition that has the smallest number of parts. We stop adding partitions once the set $P^k(n)$ contains the required $k \%$ of the total number of partitions. I am interested in the partition in $P^k(n)$ that has the highest number of parts, call this $max\left(P^k(n)\right)$ .

So for fixed $k$ and increasing $n$ we get $\operatorname{max}\left(P^k(n)\right) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n}\operatorname{Log}(n))$ .
