The number $k$ is considered a Sierpinski number if the sequence determined by that $k$ contains no primes. One way to show that such a $k$ is a Sierpinski number is to find a covering system of congruences for the sequence proving there are no primes in the sequence.  The way to show that such a $k$ is not a Sierpinski number is to find one prime among the numbers in the sequence. For those sequences where a prime has been found, that is, $k$ is not a Sierpinski number, is it known whether there could be infinitely many primes in that sequence? If only a finite number of primes are expected to be in the sequence, then a covering system of congruences might work after a certain $n$ to show that the rest of the sequence contains only composite numbers. Sierpinski showed that there are an infinite number of $k$ whose sequences contain no primes.  My conjecture is that there can be at most a finite number of primes for any $k$, but I wonder if this has not already been resolved by someone or if someone has already made the conjecture.","Consider the sequence of numbers ranging over $n$ of the form $k\cdot a^n + 1$ for a fixed, odd natural number $k$.

Kopp gives an example of a relatively ""big"" set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with relatively ""small"" gaps that fails to be an asymptotic finite basis. I'm having a problem in trying to understand one of the steps. Firstly, let $A_n$ for $n\geqslant 1$ and $A$ be as in the link. Given that $|A_n| = \frac{2^{2^n}- 2\cdot2^{2^{n-1}}}{2^n} > \frac{2^{2^n}-2^{2^{n-1}}}{2^{n-1}}$, we will have, in fact, that: $$A(x) \geqslant \sum_{k\leqslant \log_2\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}} |A_k| > \sum_{k\leqslant \log_2\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}} \frac{2^{2^k}- 2^{2^{k-1}}}{2^{k-1}} \geqslant \frac{\lfloor x\rfloor-2}{\log_2{\lfloor x\rfloor}}\gg \frac{x}{\log{x}}.$$ I'll skip show that the gaps are in fact $\ll \sqrt{x}~$ and that it contains infinitely many non-multiples of $m$ for every $m>1$ (I haven't tried to do this, but I think it's reasonable...). Now the claim is: Claim [G.S. Kopp]. $2^{2^n}$ cannot be written as a sum of fewer than $n−\log_2{n}$ elements of $A$. So, to prove this, we suppose the converse: take $a_1,\ldots,a_k \in A$ with $a_1\leqslant\cdots\leqslant a_k$ such that $2^{2^n} = a_1+\ldots +a_k$ and suppose $k< n-\log_2{n}$. Now clearly $a_k\in A_n$, otherwise we would have $a_1+\ldots +a_k < k\cdot 2^{2^{n-1}} < 2^{2^n}$. From $a_k \leqslant 2^{2^n}-2^{2^{n-1}}-2^n+1$ follows $2^{2^n}-a_k \geqslant 2^{2^{n-1}}+2^n-1>2^{2^{n-1}}$, and one may deduce by a similar argument that $a_{k-1}\in A_n\cup A_{n-1}$.

On a related note: one can even show that for other numbers it is impossible to provide congruence conditions (cf. here , here , and page 19 here ) . Statement 2: The more general case goes as follows. . Statement 3: Finding the HCF for $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n})$ is difficult. However, when $n$ is one of Euler's 65 convenient numbers then the Hilbert class field of $K$ equals the genus field of $K$ .

Two worked out examples: The genus field of $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ is $M=K(\sqrt{5})=K(i)$ .

Any help will be appreciated!","I am asked the following: Show that the number of integer solutions to $y^p=x^2+2$ for any odd prime $p$ is at most $p-1$. I checked that for $y^p=x^2+2$, the same method for $y^3=x^2+2$ works and I get that $x+\sqrt{-2}=(a+b\sqrt{-2})^p$ for some integer $a$ and $b$. I then expand RHS with Binomial Theorem and get $$\sum_{k=0}^p {p\choose k}a^k (b\sqrt{-2})^{p-k}$$ Since $(\sqrt{-2})^n$ is real whenever $n$ is even, equate real and imaginary parts and get $$x=\sum_{k=0, k \mbox{ odd}}^p {p\choose k}a^k (b\sqrt{-2})^{p-k}$$ and $$\sqrt{-2}=\sum_{k=0, k \mbox{ even}}^{p-1} {p\choose k}a^k (b\sqrt{-2})^{p-k}$$ Divide through by $\sqrt{-2}$ and take $b$ out to get $$1=b\left(\sum_{k=0, k \mbox{ even}}^{p-1} {p\choose k}a^k (b\sqrt{-2})^{p-k-1}\right)$$ So we must have $b=1$ or $b=-1$. Also, the horrible sum inside the bracket is a polynomial of degree $p-1$, so for each choice of $b$ there can be at most $p-1$ (integer) choices of $a$. Now here is the problem. Because there are two choices of $b$, there are at most $2(p-1)$ choices of $(a,b)$ that satisfy the last equality. Thus there are at most $2(p-1)$ choices of $x$. But I can't seem to find a way to lower this upper bound to just $p-1$. I am feeling so close! Any help will be appreciated!",,"['number-theory', 'diophantine-equations']"

So the question remains open.","I am looking at the length of the longest sequences of adjacent integers that are not coprime to $N$ for very large $N$. Let $F_N$ be the set of integers less than $N$ which are not coprime with $N$: $$ F_N = \{x : x \in \mathbb{N}, x \lt N , \gcd(x,N)=1\}  $$ Let $g(N)$ be the length of the longest sequence of adjacent integers in $F_N$. IE something like: $$ g(N) = \max (i\in \mathbb{N}) : \exists a\in F_n : \forall b : a \le b \lt a+i, b\in F_N  $$ What is the least upper bound on $g(N)$, i.e. the maximum length of a sequence of adjacent numbers in $F_N$? Some direct calculation suggests that $g(N)$ steps up when $N$ is primorial, so if $P_i$ is the primorial sequence, then: $$ \forall N \lt P_i, g(N) \lt g(P_i) $$ I have no proof of this, but it suggests $g(P_i)$ may be useful in finding a least upper bound. There are $N - \phi (N)$ non-coprimes of $N$ less than $N$ (where $\phi$ represents Euler's totient function, labelled 'phi' in the table below). The assumption that these are evenly spread giving $$g(N) \approx \frac N {\phi (N)}$$ is clearly wrong. Better estimates (for the primorial values of $N$ only) seem to be: $$g(N) \approx 2 \log(N)$$ and $g(N) \approx$ twice the highest prime factor of $N$. However, these are untested outside the data below, and again I have no proof.

98,Approach to elliptic curve $y^2=x^3+1/4+p/a^2$,Approach to elliptic curve,y^2=x^3+1/4+p/a^2,"While taking a brute-force look at this question I discovered that it seems that almost every prime (I'll conjecture every prime larger than 20627) can be written as $p=w^2+wc+d$ for $w,c,d\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and with $cd$ a perfect cube. This can be rearranged to say that for almost any $p$ there is a positive integer $a<p$ such that the equation $$ y^2=x^3+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{p}{a^2} $$ has a solution of the form $(x,y)=(-u/a,v/(2a))$ where $u,v\in \mathbb{Z}^+$. (This is slightly weaker, to yield the form for $p$ above we also need $a\mid u^3$ and $v\equiv a\pmod{2}$.) This looks like a variation of seeking integer points on a Mordell curve, but allowing solutions on a finer grid. It might be a more difficult way of looking at the problem, but does it seem like some theory of elliptic curves could help classify when there's a solution (in general, or say given $a=1$ or $a=2$)? Or, given that there is a solution for $a=1$, does this suggest an algorithm for finding it?","While taking a brute-force look at this question I discovered that it seems that almost every prime (I'll conjecture every prime larger than 20627) can be written as $p=w^2+wc+d$ for $w,c,d\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and with $cd$ a perfect cube.

For example $3=(11)$, $3^2=(1001)$ which means that we let the $k$-th bit from the right be $1$ if the binary representation of this power of 3 contains $2^{k-1}$, and $0$ otherwise. Prove that the highest power of 3 that has a palindromic binary representation is $3^3 = (11011)$.
