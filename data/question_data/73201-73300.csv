0,Imposing the topology of open rays in $\Bbb R$,Imposing the topology of open rays in,\Bbb R,"After having received Brian M. Scott's permission (see comments in the selected answer) I am integrating his suggestions with my own solutions to form a complete answer to the questions apperaing below. Let $\mathscr{T}$ be the collection of subsets of $\Bbb R$ consisting   of $\emptyset, \Bbb R$ and the rays of the form $(r, \infty)$,   where $r \in \Bbb R$. $(a)$ Exhibit that this, indeed, is a topology on $\Bbb R$. Proof : Given any finite number of open sets of the form above, $\exists$ a maximal $r_n$. The set $(r_n, \infty)$ is the intersection of these finite sets. Let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary family of open sets. Let $r_{\min} = \inf\{r_i\}$. Then $(r_{\min}, \infty)$ is the union of the $U_i$ and clearly it is of the desired form to be an element of the topology. If $r_{\min} = -\infty$ then the union of the $U_i$ is the entire $\Bbb R$. $(b)$ Show that it fails to be a topology if $r \in \Bbb Q$. I don't have the full answer to this. I think that there should be a problem in the union of arbitrarily many open sets. Any help with a counterexample will be very helpful. Answer the following questions. Is $(\Bbb R, \mathscr{T})$: $(c)$ $T_1$? No. Let $x_1 \neq x_2 \in \Bbb R$ and assume without loss of generality that $x_1 < x_2$. Then any open set containing $x_1$ will be of the form $x_1 - \epsilon, \infty$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ and will encessarily contain $x_2$. $(d)$ Hausdorff No. Being Hausdorff (or $T_2$) would imply that it is $T_1$, a contradiction to (a). $(e)$ metrizable No. If there was a metric, the metric space would have to be Hausdorff, contradicting (b). $(f)$ second - countable I have no idea on how to go about this one. $(g)$ compact No. There exists no finite cover of this space. Suppose we are given a finite cover of this space. Then there exists a minimal $r$ such that $(r_{\min}, \infty)$ covers the entire space.

Let $(r, \infty)$ be a neighbourhood of $x$ and let $\{U_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an open cover. Then, there must exist $q \in \Bbb R$ such that $q \ge r$ so that $(q, \infty)$ is a set of the open cover. Clearly, taking $(q, \infty)$ as the subcover completes the proof. $(i)$ connected In part $(j)$ we prove that $(\Bbb R, \mathcal{T})$ is path-wise connected, hence connected. $(j)$ path-wise connected $\Bbb R$ is convex.

Take a point $P\in T$ and remove it, I want to show that $S^1 \lor S^1$ is a deformation retract of $T-\{P\}$ which is given by glueing two circles at some point. Intuitively: The point $P$ divides the inner area of the rectangle in four parts, those points lying above $P$ or below $P$ , and left and right of $P$ . These parts will be the triangles delimited by the segments connecting the point $P$ to the vertices. Now I can define a retraction collapsing each point of the rectangle to the corresponding point on the base of the triangle it belongs to. This is not well defined for points lying on the segments connecting $P$ to the vertices, but each choice will give some retraction, and the retraction will be homotopic to the identity because the rectangle is a convex set ( edit : I think this point is wrong, because if I remove a point I lose the convexity).

Next, I want to use additivity of the Euler characteristic: $$ \chi(X\cup Y) = \chi(X) + \chi(Y) - \chi(X \cap Y) $$ Using the fact that $X\cap Y$ is a circle so its Euler characteristic is zero. Because $X$ and $Y$ are identical, it is enough to compute $\chi(X)$ . Now, the space $X$ is equivalent to a cylinder with an open disk removed. I know that the Euler characteristic of a cylinder is zero. Consequently, removing a disk from a cylinder will yield a space whose Euler characteristic is $-1$ , yielding $\chi(X) = \chi(Y) = -1$ .

Given an example of a topology on $\mathbb {N}$ such that it makes it a compact and Hausdorff space. Can this topology also be connected? My solution so far: Let $(\mathbb{N},\tau)$ and $(\mathbb{N}$$\cup\left\{ \infty\right\} ,\tau')$ be two topological spaces. The topology $\tau$ is the subspace topology inherited from the usual topology in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\tau'$ is the topology of the Aleksandrov compactification of $\mathbb{N}$. Consider the map  \begin{array}{cccc} f: & (\mathbb{N}\cup\left\{ \infty\right\} ,\tau^{'}) & \rightarrow & (\mathbb{N},\tau^{*})\\  & \infty & \mapsto & 0\\  & n & \mapsto & n+1 \end{array} I claim that the final topology induced by $f$ is Hausdorff and compact. $\tau$ is the discrete topology since every singleton is open. $\tau'=\tau\cup\{(\mathbb{N}\setminus C)\cup\{\infty\}\mid C\text{ is compact in }\mathbb{N}\}$. The compact sets of $\mathbb{N}$ are finite sets because the compacts sets of a discrete topology must be finite (the proof being clear). Therefore,  $$ \tau'=\tau\cup\left\{ (\mathbb{N}\setminus\{n,\dots,k\})\cup\{\infty\}\right\}  $$ The final topology induced by $f$ is the finest topology that makes $f$ continuous, i.e. $U\in\tau^{*}\iff f^{-1}(U)\in\tau'$ and it follows that  $$ \tau^{*}=\left\{ \left\{ n\right\} \mid n\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\left\{ 0\right\} \right\} \cup\left\{ \mathbb{N}\setminus\left\{ n,\dots,k\right\} \mid n>0\right\}  $$ It's easy to see that $(\mathbb{N},\tau^{*})$ is compact since for any cover of $\mathbb{N}$ there is a finite subcover of the form $\mathbb{N}\setminus\left\{ n,\dots,k\right\} \cup\left\{ n,\dots,k\right\} $. I could also reason that the image of a compact space is compact but one gains more insight in this fashion. Let's check that $(\mathbb{N},\tau^{*})$ is still Hausdorff. Let $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $x\neq y$. There are two cases to be considered. If $x,y\neq0$ then pick the following open sets $U=\left\{ x\right\} $ and $V=\left\{ y\right\} $. Now suppose, without loss of generality that $x\neq0$. Then choose the opens sets $U=\left\{ x\right\} $ and $V=\mathbb{N}\setminus\{x\}$. In either case $U\cap V=\emptyset$ and $U,V\in\tau^{*}$proving that it is indeed Hausdorff. Clearly this topological space isn't connected. Given any subspace $U\subset\mathbb{N}$ which is not a singleton or $\emptyset$ (these are always trivially connected) it is always possible to find $V_{1},V_{2}\in\tau^{*}$ such that $V_{1}\cap V_{2}=\emptyset$ and $V_{1}\cup V_{2}=U$. Again, let's consider two different cases. If $0\notin U$ then $U$ is a discrete space which is trivially disconnected. If $0\in U$ then simply set $V_{1}=U\setminus\left\{ 0\right\} $ and $V_{2}=\mathbb{N}\setminus\left\{ n,\dots,k\right\} $ such that $\left\{ n,\dots,k\right\} \notin V_{1}$. This proves that this space is actually totally disconnected. Questions : I feel that this is always true, i.e. given any compact and Hausdorff topology on $\mathbb{N}$ it is always the case that it can't be connected. My argument would go like this: since the Aleksandrov compactification is unique up to homeomorphism then every topology that I could give for $\mathbb{N}$ would give rise to a homeomorphic topological space. Clearly I could have defined $f$ in another way but the topology would be the ""same"" (up to homeomorphism).

However, not all topological spaces are metric spaces, for example the cofinite topology is not metric since it is not Hausdorff. But, I still have question which is whether every topological space is the continuous image of a metric space. I am thinking about considering a discrete space in the domain to ensure that the function is continuous. But I could not finish the argument. Any help will be appreciated.",,"['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

Put $ X^{*}=X\cup \{\infty  \}$, and topologize $X^*    $ by taking as open sets all the open   subsets $U$ of $X$ together with all subsets $V$ which contain $\infty  $  and such that $X\setminus V$ is closed and compact Show that the one point compactification of $\mathbb{Q}$ which is $\mathbb{Q}^*$ is Not Hausdorff.

My Attempt: Suppose to the contrary $\mathbb{Q}^*$ is Hausdorff, then we take two points $x$, $\infty \in \mathbb{Q}^*$, $x \neq \infty$, and produce disjoint open sets $U,V$ such that $x \in U$ and $\infty \in V$ By definition, we know that $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ is a closed and compact space such that $x \in U \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ We wish to produce a contradiction such that $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ is not closed, or not compact. But we know that $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ has to be closed since $V$ is open, therefore we need to show $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ is not compact. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be an open cover of $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$. Since  $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$ is claimed to be compact, then $\mathcal{U}$ has a finite subcover $\{U_i|i \in F\}$, $F$ is finite in  $\mathbb{Q} \backslash V$. Then for all $x \in \mathbb{Q}\backslash V$, $\exists i \in F$ s.t. $x \in U_i$ (...Ugh everything seems fine...) Can someone provide me with some help as to how to go on with this proof?
