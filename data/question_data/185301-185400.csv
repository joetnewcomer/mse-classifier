1,Can somebody help me on a simple chain rule differentiation problem [As level],Can somebody help me on a simple chain rule differentiation problem [As level],,"It's my first time using this forums so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong and pardon for my stupid question. So I believe that when you differentiate $2$ functions e.g $y = f(g(x))$, you would differentiate the inner one first, then the outer one with the inner function acting as $x$ like this:  $$y = g'(x) \cdot f'(g(x))$$ However, I'm struggling to see where the definition of a function is. Let me illustrate: So in my book it says. $$y = 3\sin(2x)$$ Is this the same as f(g(y(x))) Where $$f(x) = 3x$$ $$g(x) = \sin{x}$$ $$y(x) = 2x$$ In this case, It would differentiate to obtain:  $$y'(x) \cdot g'(y(x)) \cdot f'(g(y(x)))$$ which would be $2 \cdot \cos{2x} \cdot 3(\sin{2x})$ However, this is wrong. The answer is $6\cos{2x}$ Could somebody please explain why or where I went wrong. It seems like that $f(x)$ is not considered as a function. But then I think about $f(x) = 3x$  and it seems to me to be like a function by itself (which is take a number and multiply it by $3$) Anyways, I'm not very sure as to how to approach this and make sure I don't get this wrong again Thanks for helping :)","It's my first time using this forums so please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong and pardon for my stupid question.

61,Question about Halmos' Naive Set Theory,Question about Halmos' Naive Set Theory,,"Halmos proves shortly before the cited paragraph that finite subsets are not equivalent to themselves. He then says the following: The number of elements in a finite set E is, by definition, the unique natural number  equivalent to E ; we shall denote it by #(E) .

This is all clear (a specification on dom[$E \rightarrow \#(E)$] of $s : s \subset X$). He then continues: This function is pleasantly related to the familiar set-theoretic relations and operations. Thus, for example, if $E$ and $F$ are finite sets such that $E \subset F$, then $\#(E) \leq \#(F)$. (The reason is that since $E \cong \#(E)$ and $F \cong \#(F)$, it follows that $\#(E)$ is equivalent to a subset of $\#(F)$.) I do not follow his reasoning. The fact itself is clear, but I do not see the implication which he is suggesting. Is he indicating that $E$, as a subset of $F$, will be mapped by this function to some natural number which is a subset of $\#(F)$?

Eg.. I am not sure if this is still called a S-Curve but i am unsure of what to google. Thanks,I was wondering if there is a simple formula to change an S-curve to have a flat area in the middle. I am using the formula.. $$y=\frac{1}{1+e^{B-x}}$$ Where $B$ is the steepness of the curve. This gives me a normal S-curve . BUT i also want a curve to go up to a flat area then continue to go up.

Note that the degree must be atleast $2$ since $\emptyset$ and $[n]$ are invariant under any function. For each $k\in[n],$ there exists a function $f:[n]\to[n]$ with $\deg(f)=2^k.$ Just map each element in $[k-1]$ to itself. Now, if $x\in[n-1]\setminus[k-1],$ let $f(x)=x+1.$ Let $f(n)=k.$ Some counting shows that this function will have $2^{k-1}+2^{k-1}=2^k$ subsets that are invariant under it. We can also achieve $2^{n-1}+1.$ Just map each element to $1.$ Then, any subset of $[n]$ containing $1$ will be invariant under it. There are $2^{n-1}$ of these. We also have to add $1$ to account for $\emptyset.$ Any other subset will not be invariant under this function. Hence, this function will have degree $2^{n-1}+1.$ We can also achieve $2^{k-1} + 2^{n-1}$ for each $k\in[n].$ Map everything in $[k]$ to itself. Map the rest to $k.$ This function will have $2^k+[(2^{n-k}-1)(2^{k-1})]=2^{k-1} + 2^{n-1}$ subsets that are invariant under it. Heuristically speaking, it seems to me that we should be able to cover all values between $2$ and $2^n.$ There are a total of $n^n$ functions on $[n]$ and only $2^n-1$ values for the degree to be.

An interesting property is that if $f:[n]\to[n]$ is a bijection, then $\deg(f)$ is a power of $2.$ In fact, $\deg(f)=2^m,$ where $m$ is the number of cycles that $f$ is a product of. This is because any invariant subset must be formed by picking some of these $m$ cycles. There are obviously ${m\choose0}+{m\choose1}+\ldots+{m\choose m}=2^m$ ways to do this. We may ask another question at this stage. Let the degree of $f$ be a power of $2.$ Must $f$ be a bijection?

Since $\exists !x_\beta =(x_{\beta ,1},…,x_{\beta ,n})$ such that $\sum_{i\in J_n} x_{\beta ,i} \cdot \alpha_i =\beta$ , we have $y=(y_1,…,y_n)=(x_{\beta ,1},…,x_{\beta ,n})=x_\beta$ .

How to show $f:\mathbb{Z}^{+} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}^{+},$ $$f(n) = n!$$ is one-to-one? I'm quite sure the function is one-to-one as $0$ is not an element of the domain, so $f(0)=f(1)$ is not a concern. However doing something like setting $f(m)=f(v)$ where $m,v$ are arbitrary elements of the domain doesn't really work, since $n!$ doesn't have an inverse. I was able to get something working algebraically by also doing $f(m+1)=f(v+1)$ , but I'm quite sure it is circular to do something like that.
