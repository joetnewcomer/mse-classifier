23,Is there a sufficiency criterion for Cantor pairing functions?,Is there a sufficiency criterion for Cantor pairing functions?,,"I was working through Pugh's Real Mathematical Analysis when I came across this proof: Theorem $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is denumerable. Proof Think of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ as an $\infty \times \infty$ matrix and walk along the successive counter-diagonals.  This gives a list $$(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (4, 1) (3, 2) (2, 3) (1, 4) (5, 1)...$$ of $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ and proves that $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ is denumerable. The proof is accompanied by a visual diagram showing successive diagonals crossed out where for each $a_{ij} \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ , $i + j = d$ , $d$ fixed. Now from the diagram, it is visually easy to see that the graph of the function given is surjective.  And I understand ""intuitively"" why the graph is injective; we can just list the ordered pairs out as ""1, 2, 3..."", where each one is different.  However, it was quite frustrating to explicitly come up with a function and check it was injective to my satisfaction.  The book gives hints in the exercises so you can eventually come up with the function $2^{i}(2j + 1)$ , which I verified was injective.   Since primes seem to be ""fundamental"" when discussing the natural numbers, I thought all Cantor pairing functions might be of the form $p^{i}(pj + k)$ where $0 < k < p$ , and $p$ is prime. Looking it up, however, Wikipedia informs me that this is not so as, $$n = f(i, j) = \dfrac{(i + j)(i + j + 1)}{2} + j$$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ , which I again verified. So my question is, what do these Cantor pairing functions generally look like?  Is there a sufficiency criterion?

Informally, also, I could define the Cartesian Product of exactly to sets to be all the possible ordered pairs with the first coordinate belonging to the first set, and the second coordinate to the second set. Now, when Paul Halmos talks about Cross Products of families (say, chance) the cross product of the family $\{X_i\}_{i \in I} = \{\{a, b, c\}, \{d, e, f\}, \{g, h, i\}\}$ and $I = \{1, 2, 3\}$ , what exactly is the extension of the so-defined set?

49,Why are the cardinalities of these subsets not adding up to the universal set?,Why are the cardinalities of these subsets not adding up to the universal set?,,"Given a set of six letters $S$ = {A, B, C, D, E, F}, I am trying to find how many lists of four letters could be made that have exactly no repeated letters, exactly two repeated letters, exactly three repeated letters, and exactly four repeated letters. The set of $6^4=1296$ possible lists in total represents the universal set of lists and has cardinality of $|S| = 1296$ . Let $U$ = the universal set, and let $X_a$ represent the subsets of $U$ where $a$ is the number of repeated letters in the elements of the subset.  For example, ABCA $\in X_2$ and DAFE $\in X_0$ . By the addition principle, since $\bigcap_{a \in {\{0, 2,3,4\}}}X_a =\emptyset$ , then $|\bigcup_{a \in \{0, 2, 3, 4\}}X_a|=|U|=1296$ .  But this does not seem to be the case when I attempt to solve this problem.  Please let me know where I go wrong. In order to find $|X_0|$ , it is a permutations problem. $6*5*4*3=360$ , so there are $360$ lists of four letters with exactly no repeated letters. $|X_2|$ and $|X_3|$ are where I am less confident in my method. In order to find $|X_2|$ , there are $4 \choose 2$ ways to choose two spots of the four possible in the list.  That means for any given spot in the list, there are $6$ letters that spot can be, but for another spot, but exactly one other spot must be that same letter.  So for any given choice of two spots in the list such as the first spot and the second spot, $6*1*5*4$ ways of arranging the letters for that specific choice of spots in the list.  Because of this, I believe that $|X_2|$ = ${4 \choose 2} * 6*5*4*1=720$ . In order to find $|X_3|$ , there are $4 \choose 3$ ways to choose three spots of the four possible in the list.  I believe that the same logic as the previous step applies, where there are $6*1*1*5$ possible ways of choosing letters for each choice of three spots in the list.

After writing an enumeration, we complemented the diagonal elements to produce an element which isn't in the enumerated list. If the number $s$ is made up from complementing the digits of $s_i$ for $i=1,2,...,n$ , then it is guaranteed that it is not one of the $s_i$ s by construction. My problem is how do we know that it isn't one of the $s_j$ s for $i=n+1,n+2,...$ . The enumeration doesn't afterall stop at n---It goes like--- ${s_1,s_2,s_3,...,s_n,s_{n+1},s_{n+2},...}$ . So our specially constructed $s$ can(infact must) fall in the list though it doesn't fall in the first $n \hspace{0.1cm}s_i$ s.

94,A set as an algebraic structure,A set as an algebraic structure,,"A set is collection of distinct objects: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) . The word distinct implies the identity relation on each set: an element of a set is equal to itself, or $a = a$ ( Does the word 'distinct' in the definition of Set implies an equivalence relation between the objects of the collection? ). Thus, every set by the definition is a relational structure with the identity relation . The identity relation is a binary relation $(a, a)$ that implies the unary identity operation $f(a) = a$ ( https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3719648/427611 ). Thus, every set by the definition is an algebraic structure with the identity operation . But Wikipedia states that a set is ""a degenerate algebraic structure S having no operations"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure#One_set_with_operations ).

Update Based on the discussion: The concept of an identity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) is more fundamental, then the concept of a set. Without the concept of identity it is not possible to introduce a set, since if an element $a$ of a set $A$ is not equal to itself than the statements "" $a$ is an element of $A$ "" and "" $a$ is not an element of $A$ "" are true at the same time. Therefore, no matter how exactly we define a set, it has the identity relation.
