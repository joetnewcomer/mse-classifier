6,Why are Del Pezzo surfaces rational?,Why are Del Pezzo surfaces rational?,,"Let $X$ be a Del Pezzo surface over an algebraically closed field $k$, i.e. a projective surface with $-K_X$ ample. I'm chiefly interested in the case that $k$ has characteristic $0$ and $X$ is smooth, so feel free to assume these if it simplifies things. Here's the idea I have so far: From the adjunction formula, we can see that any $-1$ curve is rational, since $K_X \cdot C < 0$ for any curve $C$. In fact, if $-K_X$ is very ample and $X$ is embedded in $\mathbb{P}^n$ via $-K_X$, this can be extended to show that lines are exactly the $-1$ curves, since $K_X \cdot C = \deg C$. In addition, $K_X^2 = \deg X$ as a subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^n$. EDIT: As Pooh Bear pointed out in the comments, the idea below is not correct: blowing down a $-1$-curve increases $K_X^2$ by $1$.

7,Visualizing sections of nontrivial vector bundles,Visualizing sections of nontrivial vector bundles,,"My question is simply: how does one think about sections of nontrivial vector bundles on a smooth manifold, for example?

However, when it comes to an arbitrary vector bundle, I have no idea how to imagine the sections. My motivation is that I'm trying to learn algebraic geometry and sheaf theory, which is explained to me as trying to generalize vector bundles (by just declaring the sections on an open set), but I'm having trouble how to think of these if they're not just trying to emulate vector fields/differential forms (or of course, ""smooth functions"" on a space in the case of the trivial bundle, which I like as motivation for the structure sheaf on a scheme).

36,Understanding the stack $B\mathbb{Z}$,Understanding the stack,B\mathbb{Z},"Here, let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the group scheme whose functor of points is the constant functor which takes a connected affine scheme to the group $\mathbb{Z}$.  I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the stack $B\mathbb{Z}$, in particular quasicoherent sheaves on it. Here's how I want to approach $BG$ for $G$ say an affine algebraic group.  One can take a smooth atlas $f: * \rightarrow BG$ and apply Barr-Beck to find that the category of coalgebras over the comonad $f^* f_*$ is equivalent to the category of quasicoherent sheaves on $BG$.  One can use smooth base change ($f$ is smooth and thus flat, also separated and finite type, everything is noetherian I think) and see that this comonad is the same as $g_* g^*$ for $g: G \rightarrow *$.  Then a coalgebra is a vector space $V$ (let's say everything is over a field of char 0) which is a comodule for $\mathcal{O}_G$ (ring of global functions).  If $V^*$ is finite-dimensional then we can take symmetric powers and spectrum and get an algebraic action $G \times V^* \rightarrow V^*$ -- here we need that $G$ is affine.  Thus a coherent sheaf on $BG$ is a vector space with a rational action of $G$.  (Is the above correct?  I understand there's also some argument involving Hopf duals, but I'm not sure there's a good analogue for the group ring for $G$ not finite.) For $G$ not affine (e.g. $G = \mathbb{Z}$, or maybe $G$ an ind-scheme like $\hat{\mathbb{G}}_a$), do we have a way to understand (coherent sheaves on) these objects? Edit: Extra question.  In the above, I had to assume that $V$ as finite-dimensional, in order for a coaction $k[V] \rightarrow k[V] \otimes k[G]$ to give a rational/algebraic action.

(Classical Nullstellensatz) $f_1,...,f_n\in \mathbb{C}[x_1,...,x_n] $ . If $g=0$ in the variety defined by zeros of $f_1,...,f_n$ , then there is a power $g^m\in \langle f_1,...,f_n\rangle$ He then asks us to prove that the Hilbert Nullstellensatz is a consequence of the Classical Nullstellensatz. I think I was able to prove this, but it is not exactly pretty, I am looking for nicer solutions and for any possible flaw in my argument. Take $\mathcal{M}$ a maximal ideal and suppose $\mathcal{M}\not= \langle x_1-a_1,...,x_n-a_n\rangle$ for any $(a_1,...,a_n)\in \mathbb{C}^n$ . Because $\mathcal{M}$ is maximal and $\langle x_1-a_1,...,x_n-a_n\rangle$ are proper ideals of our ring this means that: $$\mathcal{M}\subset \langle x_1-a_1,...,x_n-a_n\rangle \quad \text{cannot hold.} $$ In other words, for every $(a_1,...,a_n)\in \mathbb{C}^n$ there is $m_{(a_1,...,a_n)}\in \mathcal{M}$ but not in $ \langle x_1-a_1,...,x_n-a_n\rangle $ . This means that $m_{(a_1,...,a_n)}(a_1,...,a_n)\not=0$ . Similarly, because $\langle x-a_1,...,x-a_n\rangle$ are maximal ideals, if it were contained in $\mathcal{M}$ it would be $\mathcal{M}$ , so we also need $m^{(a_1,...,a_n)}\in \langle x-a_1,...x-a_n\rangle$ but not in $ \mathcal{M}$ .

One can define a functor by the definition Call functors of this form affine schemes. Now we can make a definition - Definition : Given an affine scheme define an open subfunctor corresponding to a subset as the functor Now the problem states - If and then show that is not an affine scheme. That is, there is no -algebra such that . To me it seems like a different version of the problem - ""The scheme is not affine."" As I understand that in that case one shows that the coordinate ring of is isomorphic to again which leads to a contradiction. Now what I tried was consider to be an affine scheme. Then So if I can show then we are done. But I am not sure how to proceed with this proof. Any help would be appreciated.","\text{Aff}_k k \text{CAlg}_k^{op} \text{Aff}_k\to Fun(\text{CAlg}_k, Set) A\mapsto h_A=\hom_{\text{CAlg}_k}(A, -) X=h_A I\subset A D(I)(R)=\{a:A\to R | Ra(I)=R\}\subset h_A(R)=\hom_{\text{CAlg}_k}(A, R) A=k[X, Y] I=\{X, Y\} D(I) k B D(I)\cong h_B S=\mathbb{A}_k^2\setminus \{(0,0)\} S k[X, Y] X=h_A \hom_{Fun(\text{CAlg}_k, Set)}(X, \mathbb{A}^1)=\hom_{Fun(\text{CAlg}_k, Set)}(h_A, h_{k[T]})=\hom_{\text{CAlg}_k}(k[T], A)\cong A \hom_{Fun(\text{CAlg}_k, Set)}(D(I), \mathbb{A}^1)\cong k[X, Y]","['algebraic-geometry', 'affine-schemes']"

Then the Noether-Lefschetz theorem states that if $X$ is very general, then $\mathrm{Pic}(\mathbb{P}^3) \rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}(X)$ is an isomorphism, so in particular, $$\mathrm{Pic}(X) \cong \mathbb{Z} \cdot \mathcal{O}_X(1).$$ Of course, there are special surfaces for which this fails and the Picard number jumps. However, I was wondering: are there any special surfaces $X$ for which $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ is not primitive in $\mathrm{Pic}(X)$ ?  In other words, can there exist a line bundle $L$ on $X$ and a positive integer $r \geq 2$ such that $L^{\otimes r} \cong \mathcal{O}_X(1)$ ?
