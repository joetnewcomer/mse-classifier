However, it's rather restrictive, since many popular constants (such as $e$, $\gamma$) are not periods. Periods are integrals of algebraic functions over algebraic domains. Periods form a ring, i.e. sum and product of periods is a period. However, they do not form a field, as far as I know, i.e. the quotient of periods is not necessarily a period (only if the denomiator is an algebraic number, as far as I understand). What happens if we also consider any quotient of periods a period? Will some additional important constants join the happy family of periods? One example I have (and the motivation for this question) is the Gauss hypergeometric function , which has an interesting integral definition: $${\displaystyle \mathrm {B} (b,c-b)\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=\int _{0}^{1}x^{b-1}(1-x)^{c-b-1}(1-zx)^{-a}\,dx\qquad \Re (c)>\Re (b)>0,} $$ provided $|z| < 1$ or $|z| = 1$ and both sides converge Using the integral definition of the Beta function we can write: $$_2F_{1}(a,b;c;z)=\frac{\int _{0}^{1}x^{b-1}(1-x)^{c-b-1}(1-zx)^{-a}\,dx}{\int_{0}^{1} x^{b-1} (1-x)^{c-b-1}dx}$$ Thus for any $a,b,c \in \mathbb{Q}$ (provided the integrals converge) and $z$ algebraic the hypergeometric function will belong to the field of periods. The other example is $1/ \pi$, since it's still not known if it's a period (according to Wikipedia).

So far, I know that $m$ can't be prime because $(\frac{-1}{p})=1$, $p$ prime, whenever $p\equiv 1\pmod4$, where $(\frac{}{})$ is the legendre symbol. Also, I've considered the following: $m=4k+1$, so $(\frac{-1}{m})=(\frac{4k}{m})=(\frac{4}{m})(\frac{k}{m})=(\frac{k}{m})$, but again I get stuck here since $m$ is composite.

My Proof So Far Note that if $m=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, $p_i$ prime, $k_i\geq 1$ then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $x^2\equiv -1\pmod{m}$ has a solution $\iff x^2\equiv -1\pmod{p_i^{k_i}}$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$. So, let us take $m=p^k$, $p$ prime, $k\geq 1$. Note that we must have $k>1$ since $k=1\implies m=p\implies (\frac{-1}{m})=1$ since $m\equiv1\pmod4$. ...

So far, I know that $m$ can't be prime because $(\frac{-1}{p})=1$, $p$ prime, whenever $p\equiv 1\pmod4$, where $(\frac{}{})$ is the legendre symbol. Also, I've considered the following: $m=4k+1$, so $(\frac{-1}{m})=(\frac{4k}{m})=(\frac{4}{m})(\frac{k}{m})=(\frac{k}{m})$, but again I get stuck here since $m$ is composite. I think that there is no such $m$, but I'm unsure how to prove it. My Proof So Far Note that if $m=p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_r^{k_r}$, $p_i$ prime, $k_i\geq 1$ then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $x^2\equiv -1\pmod{m}$ has a solution $\iff x^2\equiv -1\pmod{p_i^{k_i}}$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$. So, let us take $m=p^k$, $p$ prime, $k\geq 1$. Note that we must have $k>1$ since $k=1\implies m=p\implies (\frac{-1}{m})=1$ since $m\equiv1\pmod4$. ...

I have found Saunderson's answer, but I believe it is missing a few answers. The problem states: $a^2+b^2=d^2 \\ a^2+c^2=e^2 \\ b^2+c^2=f^2$ Saunderson proves the answer is $a=y(4x^2-z^2)\\ b=x(4y^2-z^2)\\ c=4xyz$ where $x,y,z$ is the Pythagorean triple $x^2+y^2=z^2$. But this skips answers like $(85,132,720)$,$(132,351,720)$, etc. The complete Saunderson proof is here: https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=1NI_AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA429 The solutions are also known as Euler Bricks.

So, being a math nerd and all, I immediately see the pattern and think palindrome...

So, when is the next time this is going to happen again? So because the rate of change is slower for the odometer number, it really depends on that.

If a pair $(a+bi, c+di) (a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Z, a\not\equiv b, c\not\equiv d\ \text{(mod 2)})$ such that $a+bi$ and $c+di$ are relatively prime is given, then can we say that repeating the following operation leads $(1,1)$ in finitely many steps? Suppose that $a+bi$ and $c+di$ are relatively prime if and only if $a+bi$ and $c+di$ don't have any common divisor except for $\pm 1,\pm i$. Operation : If a pair $(a+bi, c+di)$ is given (we may suppose that $N(a+bi)\le N(c+di)$ where $N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2$), the next pair is defined as $(a+bi, (c+di)+\epsilon (1+i)(a+bi))$ with an appropriate choice of $\epsilon=\pm 1,\pm i$. Example : Noting that $3+2i$ and $4+i$ are relatively prime since each of them is a prime, we know that the pair $(3+2i,4+i)$ satisfies the condition above. Noting that $N(3+2i)\le N(4+i)$,  $$\begin{align} (3+2i,4+i) & \rightarrow (3+2i,-1+2i)\ \ \ \ (\because \ \ (4+i)+(+i)(1+i)(3+2i)=-1+2i)\\  & \rightarrow (2-i, -1+2i)\ \ \ \  (\because \ \ (3+2i)+(+i)(1+i)(-1+2i)=2-i)\\   & \rightarrow (2-i,-i)\ \ \ \  (\because \ \ (-1+2i)+(-i)(1+i)(2-i)=-i)\\  & \rightarrow (1,-i)\ \ \ \  (\because \ \ (2-i)+(-1)(1+i)(-i)=1)\\   & \rightarrow (1,1)\ \ \ \ (\because \ \ (-i)+(+1)(1+i)(+1)=1). \end{align}$$ Motivation : I've been looking for a similar algorithm for Gaussian integers $\mathbb Z[i]$ as Euclidean Algorithm for rational integers $\mathbb Z$. Then, I reached the operation above. However, I'm facing difficulty for proving or disproving that repeating the operation leads $(1,1)$ for any pair. Can anyone help? Edit 1 : As Gerry Myerson pointed out, the Euclidean algorithm works fine in the Gaussian integers. Edit 2 : I think if we can prove the following lemma, then we can say that repeating the operation leads $(1,1)$ in finitely many steps. However, I'm facing difficulty for proving the lemma.

Conversely, the necessity is obvious if we choose $\gamma=\beta^2$. $\square$ I feel that I'm missing something which is stopping me from understand this. $|\beta_{n+1}-\beta_n|_p<\frac{1}{p^n}\implies p^n$ divides $(\beta_{n+1} - \beta_n)$, and if $\beta_{n+1}=\beta_n+\delta_n$ then this must mean $\delta_n$ is divisible by $p^n$. If we take $\delta_n$ as $\delta_n=\frac{\alpha-\beta_n^2}{2\beta_n}$, then this gives us $\beta_{n+1}^2=\alpha+\delta_n^2 \implies \beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha=\delta_n^2$. Then we have shown that $\beta_{n+1}-\alpha$ is divisible by $p^{n+1}$, i.e. that $|\beta_{n+1}^2-\alpha|_p<\frac{1}{p^{n+1}}$. Was this the aim of the proof? An inductive argument on the terms of $(\beta_n)$? If not what is it that I have misunderstood in this theorem? Many thanks in advance for any replies, I would love to understand this.",,"['number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'analytic-number-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory']"
94,Question on Proposition Neukirch 10.3 - Splitting of prime ideals in $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$,Question on Proposition Neukirch 10.3 - Splitting of prime ideals in,\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_n),"I am reading Proposition 10.3 of Neukirch which I have appended below: Proposition 10.3 (Neukirch): Let $n  = \prod_{p} p^{\nu_p}$ be the factorisation of the positive integer $n$ into prime numbers, and for every prime number $p$ denote by $f_p$ the multiplicative order of $p$ mod $n/p^{\nu_p}$. Then one has in $\Bbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ the factorisation      $$p = (\mathfrak{p}_1\ldots \mathfrak{p}_r) ^{\varphi(p^{\nu_p})} \pmod{p}$$     where the $\mathfrak{p}_i$ are distinct prime ideals of $\mathcal{o} = \Bbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$ lying over $(p)$, all of ramification index $f_p$. The idea of the proof is that it will suffice to show that $\phi_n(X)$, the minimal polynomial of $\zeta_n$ factors as $$\phi_n(X) = (p_1(X)\ldots p_r(X))^{\varphi(p^{\nu_p})} \pmod{p}.$$ Now let us write $n = p^{\nu_p}m$ with $(m,p) = 1$. I get how he deduces the congruence $$\phi_n(X) = \phi_m(X)^{\varphi(p^{\nu_p})} \pmod{p}.$$ The part where I don't understand next is where he says: Observing that $f_p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $p^{f_p} \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$, it is obvious that this congruence reduces us to the case where $p$ does not divide  $n$, and hence $\varphi(p^{\nu_p}) = \varphi(1) = 1.$ Why is it that in the case $p|n$ then the result follows? It seems to me he is claiming that when $p|n$ we have the polynomial $x^m-1$ having no multiples roots mod $p$. I don't understand the link between $p$ multiplicative order $f_p$ mod $m$ and the separability of $x^m - 1$ in the case $p|n$ Thanks.","I am reading Proposition 10.3 of Neukirch which I have appended below: Proposition 10.3 (Neukirch): Let $n  = \prod_{p} p^{\nu_p}$ be the factorisation of the positive integer $n$ into prime numbers, and for every prime number $p$ denote by $f_p$ the multiplicative order of $p$ mod $n/p^{\nu_p}$.
