[duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : Reflection inside spherical mirror (5 answers) Closed 2 years ago . Consider the following situation.

37,Calculating scalar curvature of a warped product $I \times N^n(k)$,Calculating scalar curvature of a warped product,I \times N^n(k),"I'm trying to work out the details of this example by R. Bryant. He considers a Riemannian manifold $(N ^n, h)$ of constant sectional curvature $k$ and constructs the following quadratic form on $\mathbb{R}^+ \times N$ : $$ g = \frac{\mathrm{d}u^2}{k-a\,u^2+ b\,u^{1-n}} + u^2\,h $$ on $M^{n+1} = \mathbb{R}^+\times N$ , where $a$ and $b$ are constants and $u>0$ is the coordinate on $\mathbb{R}^+$ . It is clear that If $I\subset\mathbb{R}^+$ is an interval on the $u$ -line on which $k-a\,u^2+ b\,u^{1-n} >0$ , then $g$ is a Riemannian metric on $I\times N$ . There are several claims of his that I thought would follow from straightforward calculations that I'm having a hard time verifying, though. One of them is the following: according to Bryant, the scalar curvature of this metric ( $g$ ) is constant and equal to $$S = n(n{+}1)a$$ Here's how I tried to calculate the scalar curvature: letting $\psi(u) = (k-a\,u^2+ b\,u^{1-n})^{-1}$ , we can define a metric $\widetilde{g}$ on $I$ by setting $\widetilde{g} = \psi \cdot \mathrm{d} u^2$ . This allows us to see $g$ as a warped product $g = \widetilde{g} + u^2 h$ . This is useful because the scalar curvature of a warped product has been calculated before several times in the literature. We have the following formula for a general multiply warped product: Let $M = B \times_{h_1} N_1^{d_1} \times \cdots \times_{h_k} N_{k}^{d_k}$ be a multiply warped product with metric $g = g_{B} \oplus h_1^2 g_{N_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus h_{k}^2 g_{N_k}$ . Then the scalar curvature of $M$ is given by $$ \begin{aligned} R_{M} = R_{B} &- 2 \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} d_i \frac{\Delta_B h_i}{h_i} + \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \frac{R_{N_i}}{h_i^2} - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} d_i(d_i - 1) \frac{\| \text{grad}_B h_i \|_B^2}{h_i^2} \\ &+ \sum_{1 \leq i \leq k} \sum_{\substack{1 \leq \ell \leq k \\ \ell \neq i  \\ }} d_i d_{\ell} \frac{g_B(\text{grad}_B h_i, \text{grad}_B h_{\ell})}{h_i h_{\ell}} \end{aligned} $$ So let's use this for our specific example, where $M = I \times N$ . Since $B = I$ is one-dimensional, $R_B = 0$ . Furthermore, we have the following formula for the Laplacian of a conformal change of metric (which we'll apply to $\widetilde{g} = \psi \cdot \mathrm{d} u^2 = e^{2 \varphi} \cdot \mathrm{d} u^2$ , where $\varphi = \frac{\ln(\psi)}{2}$ ) $$ \Delta_{\widetilde{g}} = e^{-2 \varphi} \Delta_g + (n-2) e^{-2 \varphi} g^{ij} \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x_j} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} $$ In our case, we have $\Delta_{ \mathrm{d} u^2} u = 0$ , which leads to $$\Delta_{\widetilde{g}} u = - \psi^{-1} \widetilde{g}^{11} (\partial_{1} \varphi) = - \psi^{-1} \cdot \left(au + \frac{1}{2} b (n-1) u^{-n} \right)$$ Therefore: $$- 2 \frac{n}{u} \Delta_{\widetilde{g}} u = \psi^{-1} \cdot \left( 2 n a + bn(n-1)u^{-n-1} \right)$$ It is also trivial that $\|\nabla u \|^2_{\widetilde{g}} = \psi$ , and since $N$ has constant sectional curvature $k$ , it is in particular an Einstein manifold with $R_{N} = n(n-1)k$ . So we get: $$R_{M} =\psi^{-1} \cdot \left( 2 n a + bn(n-1)u^{-n-1} \right) + \frac{n(n-1)k}{u^2}- \frac{n(n-1) \psi}{u^2}$$ instead of $R_M = n(n+1) a$ , as Bryant states. So I probably made a mistake in my calculations, but despite having tried really hard several times now, I fail to see where such a mistake could have occurred. Can anyone spot any mistakes in my calculations? I'd really appreciate any help (if anyone can think of an easier way to calculate the scalar curvature, please let me know!). Thanks in advance! EDIT : My mistake was in claiming ""It is also trivial that $\|\nabla u \|^2_{\widetilde{g}} = \psi$ "". It is most definitely not trivial. It is in fact wrong. While $\mathrm{d} f$ does not depend on the metric $g$ , the vector field $\nabla f$ DOES depend on the metric. Moreover, doing the calculations via the moving frame method (as per Deane's answer) is a lot better.","I'm trying to work out the details of this example by R. Bryant. He considers a Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature and constructs the following quadratic form on : on , where and are constants and is the coordinate on . It is clear that If is an interval on the -line on which , then is a Riemannian metric on . There are several claims of his that I thought would follow from straightforward calculations that I'm having a hard time verifying, though. One of them is the following: according to Bryant, the scalar curvature of this metric ( ) is constant and equal to Here's how I tried to calculate the scalar curvature: letting , we can define a metric on by setting . This allows us to see as a warped product . This is useful because the scalar curvature of a warped product has been calculated before several times in the literature.

), $$\frac{((x−h)\cos(A)+(y−k)\sin(A))^2}{a^2}+\frac{((x−h)\sin(A)-(y−k)\cos(A))^2}{b^2}=1$$ I would like to calculate the variables $a$ , $b$ (the semi-axes respectively) and $A$ (the angle of rotation of the ellipse from the x-axis) for an ellipse of the largest possible area, from which I will be able to construct an ellipse of the same size and angle at any point $(h, k)$ . My initial idea was to find the minimum radius of the area defined by the points and centred on $(h, k)$ , then find the radius of the same area at an angle of 90 degrees from the minimum, but a very rough calculation appears to show that this will include some amount of area outside the boundary defined by the points. For the ellipse to fit within the points, the major axis must then be narrower than the total width of the area at that angle. On the other hand, another possibility would be to find the maximum radius of the area defined by the points and centred on $(h, k)$ , then find the radius of the same area at an angle of 90 degrees from the maximum, but once again this includes some amount of area outside the point boundary, and for the ellipse to fit within the points, the minor axis must then be narrower than the total width of the area at that angle. It is difficult to tell which method will yield an ellipse of larger possible area by these rough plots, or if there is yet another superior method; so I ask, is there a method or algorithm to determine this analytically?

), I would like to calculate the variables , (the semi-axes respectively) and (the angle of rotation of the ellipse from the x-axis) for an ellipse of the largest possible area, from which I will be able to construct an ellipse of the same size and angle at any point . My initial idea was to find the minimum radius of the area defined by the points and centred on , then find the radius of the same area at an angle of 90 degrees from the minimum, but a very rough calculation appears to show that this will include some amount of area outside the boundary defined by the points. For the ellipse to fit within the points, the major axis must then be narrower than the total width of the area at that angle. On the other hand, another possibility would be to find the maximum radius of the area defined by the points and centred on , then find the radius of the same area at an angle of 90 degrees from the maximum, but once again this includes some amount of area outside the point boundary, and for the ellipse to fit within the points, the minor axis must then be narrower than the total width of the area at that angle. It is difficult to tell which method will yield an ellipse of larger possible area by these rough plots, or if there is yet another superior method; so I ask, is there a method or algorithm to determine this analytically? If it is possible to use an equation for a skewed ellipse to cover an even larger area then that would be even better - the aim is to generate an equation for a shape covering the maximum amount of area defined by the points, to then be able to determine the width of the resulting shape at any angle.","(x, y) (h, k) \frac{((x−h)\cos(A)+(y−k)\sin(A))^2}{a^2}+\frac{((x−h)\sin(A)-(y−k)\cos(A))^2}{b^2}=1 a b A (h, k) (h, k) (h, k)","['geometry', 'optimization', 'conic-sections', 'computational-geometry', 'discrete-geometry']"

The answer is simple by simply projecting each faces to the ""wall"", if we assume all tilings can resemble a convex continuous manifold $3$ D cubic stack.

My suspicion is that (1) produces incorrect delta rotations for some input values, so combining the rotations does not yield the correct result. Why? If so, how can I recognize ""problematic input values"" and handle them gracefully?",,"['geometry', '3d', 'rotations', 'quaternions']"

85,How to create a two circle Venn diagram with 3 equal sections?,How to create a two circle Venn diagram with 3 equal sections?,,"I had a student ask if I could draw a Venn diagram in which each region was of equal area. I have played around with this a little but have not landed on an answer I'm satisfied with. I was able to find the area of the overlapping region by subtracting the area of the triangle from the sector. I set the area of the overlapped area equal to the area of half of my circle. I am trying to get this down to two variables so that I can plug in a set radius and find an angle or something to that effect. So far I have been able to simplify this down to radius, triangle height, and angle. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","I had a student ask if I could draw a Venn diagram in which each region was of equal area.
