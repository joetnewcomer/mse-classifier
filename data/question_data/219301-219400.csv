I have worked through the first $4$ chapters of Vakil's notes and now I am thinking whether should I continue or try to study Hartshorne. Vakil's notes are very well-organized. Especially, the exercises appear just in the right time, and there are more explanation of the exercises, so that I know what I am doing. But the problem is most arguments are given in the form of exercises, which means I am always stuck. The typical situation is after $2$ hours work, maybe I am still in the same page. But the book has almost $800$ pages! Hartshorne has some proof, the exercises also have some explanation. So maybe I should try to work Hartshorne? Another question is about exercises. How long should I spend for an exercise that stick me. Should I look up a solution after maybe struggling for half hour? There are solutions for Hartshorne, so maybe study Hartshorne is more convenient since it is easier to look up solution? Also, what is the right pace to learn the stuff? I mean should I worry if every day I spend $3$ hours to learn the stuff but I only finish $1$ page? (I know maybe I should spend more time, but unfortunately I am teaching myself algebraic geometry and I have other classes currently) I appreciate any advice, thanks!","I believe Hartshorne and Vakil's notes are two most popular text currently, so my question is about how to choose the text.

1,Favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma,Favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma,,"Inspired by a recent question on the nilradical of an absolutely flat ring, what are some of your favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma? It would be good if you outlined a proof for the result too. I am also interested to see the Nakayama Lemma prove some facts in Algebraic Geometry if possible. Here are some facts which one can use the Nakayama lemma to prove. A local ring that is absolutely flat is a field - proof given here . Every set of $n$  - generators for a free module of rank $n$ is a basis - proof given here . For any integral domain $R$ (that is not a field) with fraction field $F$, it is never the case that $F$ is a f.g. $R$ - module. Sketch proof: if $F$ is f.g. as a $R$ - module then certainly it is f.g. as a $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$ module for any maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$. Then $\mathfrak{m}_{\mathfrak{m}}F = F$ and so Nakayama's Lemma implies $F = 0$ which is ridiculous.","Inspired by a recent question on the nilradical of an absolutely flat ring, what are some of your favourite applications of the Nakayama Lemma?

3,Proving that the genus of a nonsingular plane curve is $\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}$,Proving that the genus of a nonsingular plane curve is,\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2},"I'm studying from Joseph Silverman's book The Arithmetic Of Elliptic Curves and I'm trying to do as many exercises as I can. Right now I'm trying to do Exercise 2.7 from chapter II which reads as follows. Let $f(X, Y, Z) \in K[X, Y, Z]$ be a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d \geq 1$ and assume that the curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equation $F = 0$ is nonsingular. Prove that     $$ \text{genus}(C) = \frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2} $$ The Exercise has a hint which tells me to define a map $C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ and use Theorem II.5.9 from that same chapter. For completeness I include the Theorem. Theorem 5.9 (Hurwitz) Let $\phi : C_1 \rightarrow C_2$ be a nonconstant separable map of smooth curves of genera $g_1$ and $g_2$, respectively. Then      $$ 2g_1 - 2 \geq (\deg{\phi})(2g_2 - 2) + \sum_{P \in C_1} (e_\phi (P) - 1) $$     Further, equality holds if and only if one of the following two conditions holds: $\text{char}(K) = 0$ $\text{char}(K) = p > 0$ and $p$ does not divide $e_\phi (P)$ for all $P \in C_1$. My attempts I consider a map $\phi : C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$, which has the form $\phi = [f, g]$ for some $f, g \in K[X, Y, Z]$ homogeneous of the same degree. Since $\mathbb{P}^1$ has genus $0$ the equality becomes $$ 2 \text{genus}(C) - 2 = -2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1) $$ so that  $$ 2 \text{genus}(C) = 2 - 2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1) $$ and we have to prove that $2 - 2\deg{\phi} + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1) = (d-1)(d-2)$. I have also tried to use the formula from Proposition 2.6 in Chapter II of the book which for this particular case tells us that $$ \sum_{P \in \phi^{-1} (Q)} e_{\phi} (P) = \deg{\phi} $$ for any point $Q \in \mathbb{P}^1$. Then using this we get $$ 2 \text{genus}(C) = 2 - 2\sum_{P \in \phi^{-1} (Q)} e_{\phi} (P) + \sum_{P \in C} (e_\phi (P) - 1) $$ for some point $Q \in \mathbb{P}^1$. Now the problem for me is that I'm not really sure how to relate the degree $d$ of the polynomial that defines the curve $C$ to those sums. I'm also wondering how it may be possible to compute those ramification indexes in the sums because I suspect that's were the problem lies. If it is of some help, I know that we can identify any map $\phi : C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$ with a function in $K(C)$ or with the constant map $\infty = [1, 0]$. I was thinking that maybe there's a way for me to get the degree $d$ to come into play here, but up until now I'm stuck and I run out of ideas. Questions So I would very much appreciate some hints and advice as to how to proceed with this exercise. I'm not looking for a full solution but for some advice and hints that may guide me in the right direction. Sorry for the long post, I know that it will not get many people to read it but I'm trying to get the most out of the exercise.

4,The algebraic de Rham complex,The algebraic de Rham complex,,"Let $A$ be a commutative $R$-algebra (or more generally a morphism of ringed spaces).

We depand that $d^{p+q}(\omega \wedge \eta) = d^p(\omega) \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \omega \wedge d^q(\eta)$ for $\omega \in \Omega^p, \eta \in \Omega^q$. This implies $d^1(a * d^0(b)) = d^0(a) \wedge d^0(b)$, and more generally $d^1$ maps $\sum_i a_i * d^0(b_i) \mapsto \sum_i d^0(a_i) \wedge d^0(b_i)$. Conversely, one could try to define $d^1$ this way. But then it is not clear to me how to show well-definedness. I will sketch what I have done to remedy this, but probably it's way too complicated, and I wonder if there is a more direct approach. There is an isomorphism $\Omega^1_{A/R} \to I/I^2$ mapping $a * d(b) \mapsto [ab \otimes 1-a \otimes b]$, where $I$ is the kernel of the multiplication map $A \otimes_R A \to A$.

Exactness implies that $I$ is isomorphic to the cokernel of this differential. Now define $A^{\otimes 3} \to \Omega^2_{A/R}$ by $a \otimes b \otimes c \mapsto d^0(ac) \wedge d^0(b)$. This is a well-defined $R$-linear map. One checks that it vanishes on the image of $A^{\otimes 4} \to A^{\otimes 3}$, hence extends to $I$. One then checks that it also vanishes on $I^2$, so that it extends to $I/I^2 \cong \Omega^1_{A/R}$. The resulting map $d^1$ has the desired description. Once one has $d^1$, one might define the other differentials inductively by $d^{p+1}(\omega \wedge \eta) = d^p(\omega) \wedge \eta + (-1)^p \omega \wedge d^1(\eta)$.

Please forgive my imprecision here; but I am extremely interested in your thoughts. In Shafarevich's Basic Algebraic Geometry I , Ch. 1 Sec. 5.3, it is proven that a finite map has finite fibers, i.e.: Let $X,Y$ be quasiprojective varieties over an algebraically closed ground field $k$ , and let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a regular map that is finite in the sense that $Y$ admits a cover by affine open subsets $V$ such that $U=f^{-1}(V)\subset X$ is affine for each $V$ , and we have $f^*:k[V]\rightarrow k[U]$ is an integral ring map. Then $f^{-1}(p)$ is a finite set for $p\in V$ . The proof is that since the ring maps are integral, the coordinate functions on $X$ satisfy polynomials over the pullbacks of the coordinate functions on $Y$ , which become actual polynomials over $k$ when an image point in $y$ in a specified $V$ is chosen. These polynomials limit the coordinates on $X$ to a finite set of values. Meanwhile, in Atiyah and MaDonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra , Ch. 5 Exercises 12-15, the ""same result"" is established in a different setting, namely: If $A$ is an integrally closed domain, $K=\operatorname{Frac}A$ , $L$ is a finite field extension of $K$ , and $B$ is $A$ 's integral closure in $L$ , then the map $\operatorname{Spec}B\rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}A$ coming from the inclusion $A\hookrightarrow B$ has finite fibers. The proof is completely different. We look at $L$ as a purely inseparable extension of a separable extension of $K$ and handle each extension separately. For the separable extension, we embed it in its Galois closure and prove that the Galois group (which is finite) acts transitively on the fibers of the map. The argument uses a form of the Going-Up Theorem and the lemma that if an ideal is contained in a finite union of prime ideals, it is fully contained in one of them. For the inseparable part, we show using a calculation that the map on $\operatorname{Spec}$ s is actually injective. Obviously the scope of the two statements is a little different.

29,*writing* proofs involving commutative diagrams,*writing* proofs involving commutative diagrams,,"This question is a little fuzzy so might be closed, but I'll give it a shot. I'm sorry this question has quite a long introduction, I don't see how to formulate it more concisely. In modern algebraic geometry (for example), many objects are defined by universal properties of commutative diagrams etc. Now sometimes we want to prove statements about them (see below for a specific example). If we were working in, say, sets, then there are often proofs that one might call ""element-wise"". That is to say we prove say that two objects are isomorphic by writing down a morphism (explicitely!), a claimed inverse, and check on all points that the compositions indeed are the identity. This does not work in (for example) the category of schemes, where a morphism ""is"" more than what it ""does to points"", and where moreover we may not have very explicit descriptions of various objects (e.g. fibred products). I thus find myself resorting to work with commutative diagrams and universal properties. This works, in the following sense: for any particular statement, I could convince a friend of it's correctness.

Recall that for $X \in Sch/\mathbb{F}_p$, the morphism $\mathcal{O}_X \to \mathcal{O}_X, x \mapsto x^p$ induces a morphism $F_X: X \to X$ known as absolute frobenius. If we now fix $S \in Sch/\mathbb{F}_p$, we can define, for $X \in Sch/S$, $X^{(p)} = X \times_{S} S'$, where $S'$ is the scheme $S$ with structure morphism $F_S$. It is then easy to see that $X \to S$ and $F_X: X \to X$ canonically induce a morphism $F_{X/S}: X \to X^{(p)}$ known as relative frobenius. Now given a base change $T \to S$, we have to show that $(X^{(p)})_T$ is canonically isomorphic to $(X_T)^{(p)}$, and that the composite $X_T \to (X_T)^{(p)} \to (X^{(p)})_T$ (first morphism being $F_{X_T/T}$) is just $F_{X/S} \times id_S.$ As I said above, I know (some way) to show this, it involves a mess of commutative diagrams, and writing this out would take a remarkable amount of space for a sequence of trivialities.","This question is a little fuzzy so might be closed, but I'll give it a shot. I'm sorry this question has quite a long introduction, I don't see how to formulate it more concisely. In modern algebraic geometry (for example), many objects are defined by universal properties of commutative diagrams etc. Now sometimes we want to prove statements about them (see below for a specific example). If we were working in, say, sets, then there are often proofs that one might call ""element-wise"". That is to say we prove say that two objects are isomorphic by writing down a morphism (explicitely!), a claimed inverse, and check on all points that the compositions indeed are the identity. This does not work in (for example) the category of schemes, where a morphism ""is"" more than what it ""does to points"", and where moreover we may not have very explicit descriptions of various objects (e.g. fibred products). I thus find myself resorting to work with commutative diagrams and universal properties. This works, in the following sense: for any particular statement, I could convince a friend of it's correctness. This would go by drawing some diagram, saying a few words, extending the diagram and so on (this is the step where I get my morphisms, say).

Edit: there is another possibility that just occurred to me: Hartshorne remarks that EGA uses a slightly different definition of very ample, and having consulted EGA I see that this is the case. So I should extend my question to ask if this is the reason for my difficulty, and if so how does it make a difference?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'coherent-sheaves']"

This I can manage to show, but in the remarks following the exercise he asks why this does not work over an arbitrary base ring $A$, and I have a hard time to see why. I have three questions and would be grateful if someone can comment on them: 1) First, is it true that $\pi^*O_{\mathbb{P}_A}(1)\simeq O_{\mathbb{P}_A}(1)$ if $\pi:\mathbb{P}_A^{n}\to\mathbb{P}_A^{n}$ is an automorphism? Over a field $k$, this holds because an automorphism induces an isomorphism on Picard groups. So a generator must be sent to a generator, but I do not understand the Picard group of $\mathbb{P}_A^{n+1}$, so I can't see if this generalizes. In any case, if it is true, please give an argument. If it's not, please give a counter-example. 2) Does it make sense to define $PGL_{n+1}(-)$ as the functor that sends $A$ to the set of $(n+1)\times (n+1)$  invertible matrices over $A$ modulo multiples of identity? If so, is it representable (possibly in some sub-category of schemes over $A$)? 3) If $PGL_{n+1}(A)$ does not parametrize automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_A^{n+1}$, what does it parametrize? 4) Is there a good description of automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_A^n$?","In exercise 16.4.B of Vakil's notes, he establishes that the group of automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}_k^n$ is $PGL_{n+1}(k)$.

Indeed it is clearly irreducible, and the existence of a nilpotent in $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ for an open set $U$ of $X$ containing at least one of the two origins implies the existence of a nilpotent in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{A}^1_k}(V)$, where $V$ is the preimage of $U$ in the affine line to which belongs the origin contained in $U$.
