I've had various attempts at this question but it never seems to lead anywhere fruitful. The hint we have been given is in the question is Consider the square of the product $$ \frac{(2m)!}{2^{2m}(m!)^2} = \frac{3 \times 5 \times 7 \times \dots \times (2m-1)}{2 \times 4 \times 6 \times \dots \times (2m)}. $$ From the hint it's not too hard to spot where one would go next - the LHS of the original question is disguised as some cheeky factorials - however induction keeps on failing for me and I'm struggling to see a more direct argument. Any light shed on this problem would be appreciated. I feel like I'm missing something obvious. Thanks in advance.,The question is as it is in the title: Show that for all .

1,Combinatorial proof that central binomial coefficients are the largest ones,Combinatorial proof that central binomial coefficients are the largest ones,,"We can easily show that the central binomial coefficients in a row of Pascal's triangle, i.e. $\binom{2n}n$ in even rows and $\binom{2n+1}n=\binom{2n+1}{n+1}$ in odd rows, have the largest values - more or less by straightforward computation. It basically suffices to check that the following inequalities are equivalent to each other: \begin{align*} \binom nk &< \binom n{k+1} \\ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} &< \frac{n!}{(k+1)!{(n-k-1)!}} \\ \frac{(k+1)!}{k!} &< \frac{(n-k)!}{(n-k-1)!}\\ k+1 &< n-k \\ 2k+1 &< n \end{align*} And it works the same way for $\binom nk \le \binom n{k+1}$ , $\binom nk \gt \binom n{k+1}$ and $\binom nk \ge \binom n{k+1}$ or even $\binom nk = \binom n{k+1}$ . From this we can see that this sequence is first increasing and then decreasing. (Such sequences are sometimes called unimodular.) And we also see that the maximum is attained in the middle.

2,Burnside's Lemma applied to grids with interchanging rows and columns,Burnside's Lemma applied to grids with interchanging rows and columns,,"I've recently learned about Burnside's Lemma ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma ) and its applications to rotating necklaces, coloring cubes and such, but I fear my understanding of it isn't mature enough and am unable to apply it to the following situation: Suppose you have a 2x3 matrix, and a set of 3 distinct colors $R, Y, B$. How many non-equivalent ways are there to color the matrix? Note that two matrices $m_1$ and $m_2$ are considered equivalent if you can turn the former into the latter by swapping any rows and/or columns as many times as you want. So I got started by setting up the Burnside's equation as follows: \begin{align*}\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} |X^g| &= \frac{1}{H! W!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_H}\sum_{\tau \in S_W} |X^{(\sigma, \tau)}|. \end{align*} where $|G|$ is the total no. of elements that act to permute the set $X$ of matrices with height and width $H\times W$. Since there are $H!$ ways to permute the rows and $W!$ ways to permute the columns, the total no. of ways to permute the matrix is $|G| = H!W!$. So we can iterate through every way to permute the rows and every way to permute the columns (hence the double summation above), and for each permutation, find out the value of |$X^{(\sigma, \tau)}$| -- which is the number of matrices that are fixed (a.k.a. not changed) when applying permutation $\sigma$ to the rows and $\tau$ to the columns. For example, say we have a 2x3 grid with the following indices for each cell: (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) There would be 2! = 2 ways to permute the rows and 3! = 6 ways to permute the columns, so the Burnside's equation becomes: \begin{align*}\frac{1}{2! 3!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_2}\sum_{\tau \in S_3} |X^{(\sigma, \tau)}| \end{align*} It is here that I hit a stumbling block. Given we have 3 distinct colors to work with, it isn't clear to me how to count up |$X^{(\sigma, \tau)}$| for each permutation. If someone could show me a step-by-step way to compute the answer for this specific example, I feel I could probably learn to apply it to a more general situation, with arbitrary values of $W$, $H$, and number of colors.

I was thinking about using stars and bars, and it seems to work if there were only three variables: If $a\leq b\leq c\leq 50$ and $a+b+c=100$ , then we can define $x=50-a,y=50-b,z=50-c$ such that $x,y,z\leq 50$ and $x+y+z=3\times 50-(a+b+c)=50$ . Then we can simply use stars and bars to find the number of triples of $\{x,y,z\}$ , each of which corresponds to a unique $\{a,b,c\}$ . If $x\neq y,y\neq z$ , and $z\neq x$ , then only one out of the six sets consisting of $x,y,$ and $z$ is listed from the smallest to the largest. Since $50$ is not a multiple of $3$ , $x=y=z$ is not possible. If two of the three elements are the same, then this element can be any integer between $1$ and $24$ , inclusive. Since it can be either $x=y\neq z$ , $x=z\neq y$ , or $y=z\neq x$ , each case appears three times. Thus, the total number of ordered triples $\{a,b,c\}$ is $\dfrac{C_{49}^2-24\times 3}{6}+24$ .

32,Combinatorial proof of $\binom{nk}{2}=k\binom{n}{2}+n^2\binom{k}{2}$,Combinatorial proof of,\binom{nk}{2}=k\binom{n}{2}+n^2\binom{k}{2},"This identity was posted a while back but the question had been closed; the question wasn't asked elaborately, though the proof of the identity is a nice application of combinatorics and a good example for future reference. Also, there was just a flat-out wrong answer which had a couple of upvotes, so I thought to give my own possible proof and sort of 'reopen' the question that was left. Hopefully this time the question will have enough context to stay alive. As a side note:  the given right side does not appear symmetric between $k$ and $n$ .  However, when $\binom{m}{2}=m(m-1)/2$ is inserted and the products expanded, only symmetric terms remain uncancelled.  Rendering the right side as $k^2\binom{n}{2}+n\binom{k}{2}$ would give the same cancellations and the same net value. Proof Suppose you have a grid of $n\times k$ dots. Firstly, the amount of ways to connect any two dots is $\binom{nk}{2}$ . Now consider the right-hand side. We can split the cases for which the connected dots are on the same column, row, or are in both different columns and rows. If the two connected dots are in the same column, we can choose two points from any two different rows in $\binom{n}{2}$ ways, and we have $k$ columns for which the two points can be on the same column, which gives a total of $k\binom{n}{2}$ options. The same argument holds for constant rows: $n\binom{k}{2}$ . Now if neither the row nor the column can stay constant, we can pick any point in $nk$ ways, and choose the second point from the remaining $(n-1)(k-1)$ points; one column and one row will be unavailable. This gives us $\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}$ options, as we have to rule out the double counting. We will now show (algebraically) that $n\binom{k}{2}+\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}=n^2\binom{k}{2}$ . We have that $\binom{k}{2}=\frac{k(k-1)}{2} =\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2n(n-1)} \iff n(n-1)\binom{k}{2}=\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}=n^2\binom{k}{2}-n\binom{k}{2}$ which leads to the equation above. Combining these cases gives $\binom{nk}{2}=k\binom{n}{2}+n\binom{k}{2}+\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2} = k\binom{n}{2}+n^2\binom{k}{2}$ If there are any mistakes or improvements on the arguments, please feel free to point them out.","This identity was posted a while back but the question had been closed; the question wasn't asked elaborately, though the proof of the identity is a nice application of combinatorics and a good example for future reference.

45,Why is Euler's totient function equal to $(p-1)(q-1)$ when $N=pq$ and $p$ and $q$ are prime in a clean intuitive way?,Why is Euler's totient function equal to  when  and  and  are prime in a clean intuitive way?,(p-1)(q-1) N=pq p q,"I had my own proof for it but I really don't like it (it feels not intuitive at all because it requires factoring!) and I feel there must be a more direct way to do it by a different counting argument. If anyone has one it would be greatly appreciated! My ""proof"": Recall: $\phi(N) = $ the number of elements that are relatively prime to $N$ (i.e. have a mod inverse) $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime. Let's count the number of elements between $1$ to $N-1$ that are NOT relatively prime to $p$ and $q$. Those elements must have at least $p$ or $q$ as one of its factors. So let include all number that have $p$ as a factor and $q$ as a factor and are in the given range. thus: $0p, 1p, 2p, ..., kp, ..., p(q-1)$ and $0q,1q,2q,...,jq,...,q(p-1)$ That gives a count of: $N - p - q + 1 = pq - p - q + 1 = (p -1)(q-1)$ QED as required. The reason I am not happy with this argument is that it seems to me there should be a clear intuitive way of doing it without having to factor or substitute the definition of $N$. This seems clear because multiplying $(p-1)$ by $(q-1)$ seems to be a very cute formula and it I would be surprise that its a coincidence because $(p-1)$ and $(q-1)$ also have clear interpretations. I am looking for a more intuitive clear reasoning, because it seems evident from the form of the formula that it should exist.","I had my own proof for it but I really don't like it (it feels not intuitive at all because it requires factoring!) and I feel there must be a more direct way to do it by a different counting argument.

46,"How to simply show that there are ""78 'strict ordinal' 2x2 game matrices""","How to simply show that there are ""78 'strict ordinal' 2x2 game matrices""",,"In ""Theory of Moves"" , Steven J. Brams analyses two-player games with two strategies per player, where each player can totally rank his payoffs, although payoffs need not be comparable among players. We can thus use values 1,2,3,4 to label the payoffs of each player. This is called a 'strict ordinal' game. An example game matrix, with player A's payoff as the first element, player B's payoff as the second element of the payoff tuples: We now define the equivalence classes of ""identical game matrices"" to reduce the number of distinct cases to analyze. The game matrices in an equivalence class are related by the following operations: Exchange columns (i.e. relabel Player A's strategies) Exchange rows (i.e. relabel Player B's strategies) Exchange the players, which means exchanging the tuple values and mirroring the matrix along the first diagonal For discussion purposes, add the non-elementary operation: Exchange columns, then rows (or the equivalent reverse): ""mirroring"" Question: How many game matrix equivalence classes are there? The author claims ""There are exactly 78 such 'strict ordinal' 2x2 games"". He must be right because his whole book is based on this. And I checked with a little program, and indeed I get 78 distinct ""canonical"" matrixes. However, using exhaustive enumeration is quite a bit in the 'brute force' domain and I am not even sure why the application of a single ""player exchange"" followed by either a ""row exchange"", ""column exchange"" or ""mirroring"" is sufficient to reach all the elements of the equivalence classes. So, is there a better way to show that there are only 78 equivalence classes (which actually is strange because this is 13 * 3 * 2, why is there a factor 13?). There has got to be. I amused myself to design a way to build the canonical matrixes by exploiting symmetries but it seems I am too rusty.

Brams analyses two-player games with two strategies per player, where each player can totally rank his payoffs, although payoffs need not be comparable among players. We can thus use values 1,2,3,4 to label the payoffs of each player. This is called a 'strict ordinal' game. An example game matrix, with player A's payoff as the first element, player B's payoff as the second element of the payoff tuples: We now define the equivalence classes of ""identical game matrices"" to reduce the number of distinct cases to analyze. The game matrices in an equivalence class are related by the following operations: Exchange columns (i.e. relabel Player A's strategies) Exchange rows (i.e. relabel Player B's strategies) Exchange the players, which means exchanging the tuple values and mirroring the matrix along the first diagonal For discussion purposes, add the non-elementary operation: Exchange columns, then rows (or the equivalent reverse): ""mirroring"" Question: How many game matrix equivalence classes are there? The author claims ""There are exactly 78 such 'strict ordinal' 2x2 games"". He must be right because his whole book is based on this. And I checked with a little program, and indeed I get 78 distinct ""canonical"" matrixes. However, using exhaustive enumeration is quite a bit in the 'brute force' domain and I am not even sure why the application of a single ""player exchange"" followed by either a ""row exchange"", ""column exchange"" or ""mirroring"" is sufficient to reach all the elements of the equivalence classes. So, is there a better way to show that there are only 78 equivalence classes (which actually is strange because this is 13 * 3 * 2, why is there a factor 13?). There has got to be. I amused myself to design a way to build the canonical matrixes by exploiting symmetries but it seems I am too rusty.

So one guy suggested (he was not serious about it) to study the problem of the minimum number of rounds for a circle of $n$ friends to handshake such that no crossovers occur. Of couse the minimum if we allow crossovers is $n-1$ rounds, because if we fix a person, then in each round he gets to shake hands with at most one other person. But there is a moment where the two guys next to him shake hands, and so he sits idle in that round. The natural question is if there is a formula for the least number of rounds needed in this case, or at least lower bound lower than the trivial bound where each person gets to shake hands with all others while everyone else stands still waiting for him to finish. I am not expecting a solution but rather hoping if this problem has been studied before. When I tried searching I ran into all sorts of homework problems like ""if 534345 handshakes happened then how many people were there"" ... I wasn't also sure of the search terms; I tried both ""crossovers"" and ""intersection"" but no avail. Edit: From the comments I realize that maybe more solid definition for the problem is needed.

The constraint is that at no round no two edges can intersect. The question is to determine the minimum number of rounds needed to solve this problem ?

Let $G_n$ be the $n$-dimensional, infinite, unit-square-grid graph, i.e. the graph whose vertices are the points of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and that has one edge between each couple of vertices separated by a Euclidean distance of 1. I know that, for any $d$ in $\mathbb{N}$, the set $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is countably infinite, i.e. one can find a bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^d$. That is not the issue here. My question is: what are the conditions under which that graph contains a Hamiltonian ray? In other words, under what conditions does a path starting at some vertex of the graph and visiting each vertex of $G_n$ exactly once (by jumping from one vertex to an adjacent vertex) exists? Because of invariance of $G$ by translation by any basis unit vector, we can consider, without loss of generality, that such a ray starts at the origin. It's easy to see that: in the $n=1$ case, no such ray exists: whichever direction you set off on the number line, you can not doubleback to collect the integers located on the other side from the origin; in the $n=2$ case, there is an infinite number of such rays: an easy example is some ""square spiral"" starting from the origin. However, the answer for $n\geq3$ eludes me. As an attempt to solve the $n=3$ case, I set out to answer a related question: whether the subgraph (let's call it $G_3'$) of $G_3$ whose coordinates are in $\{-1,0,1\}^3$ contains a Hamiltonian ray starting at the origin. Not knowing any better, I settled the issue by brute force in Matlab (see the code below, in which you can change the starting point).

A reduced decomposition of a permutation $\pi$ of degree $n$ is an expression $\pi = g_1 \cdots g_m$ so that (1) each $g_k = (i,i+1)$ is an adjacent transposition for some $i$, (2) $m$ is the number of inversions of $\pi$.

96,How to improve at combinatorics?,How to improve at combinatorics?,,"I'm currently learning some basic combinatoric techniques in a class called ""Intro to Combinatorics"", and while all the material makes perfect sense and the steps are always clear after-the-fact, I cannot for the life of me seem to derive anything on my own. As an example, we were learning about using bijections to show that two sets have equal cardinality. If you have a set $A$, which is difficult to count, and a set $B$ which is easy to count, and a bijection $f:A\to B$, then $\|A\| = \|B\|$. So here's an example problem on one of the assignments: Show that the number of $k$-multisubsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\cdots, n\}$ is    $$ {n+k-1\choose k} $$   where a $k$-multisubset of $[n]$ is a $k$-tuple $(a_1,\cdots, a_k)$ with $a_i\in[n]$, and $1\le a_i\le a_{i+1}\le n$. I toiled over this for a while , but I simply couldn't find a bijection between the set of $k$-multisubsets of $[n]$ and the set of $k$-subsets of $[n+k-1]$. I listed out tons of cases, stretched my imagination to come up with any and all ideas I could, but nothing worked in general, it only worked for ""that case"". Then, I asked a friend, and the answer is apparently this: $$ f(\vec a) = \vec a + (0, 1, 2,\cdots, k - 1) $$ (where the result is interpreted as a set). After the fact, it seems so obvious that this should be the result (or that the bijection should look something like this). The basic idea of this bijection is to ""remove"" the cases where $a_i = a_{i+1}$. I recognized that I had to remove that restriction, but I kept thinking of ""bijections"" $f(a)\to b$ where if $a_i = a_{i+1}$ then $b_i = b_{i+1}-1$ (working incrementally, so that if $a_i = a_{i+1} = a_{i+2}$ then $b_i = b_{i+1}-1 = b_{i+2}-2$), but this didn't work. Here's another example of something we did in class: find the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$. The solution is to denote $S = \{\emptyset\}\cup A\cup A^2\cup A^3\cup\cdots$, and then define a weight function $w:S\to\mathbb{N}$ by $w(\alpha) = \sum_{a\in\alpha}a$ (and $w(\emptyset) = 0$). Then the number of partitions of $n$ with parts in $A$ is given by $\|\{a\in S\ |\ w(a)=n\}\|$, which is also given by $$ \begin{aligned} [x^n]\sum_{a\in S}x^{w(a)} & = [x^n]\sum_{k\ge 0}\sum_{a\in A^k}x^{w(a)} \\ & = [x^n]\sum_{k\ge0}\left(\sum_{a\in A}x^{w(a)}\right)^k \\ & = [x^n]\left(1-\sum_{a\in A}x^{w(a)}\right)^{-1} \end{aligned} $$ I completely understand the machinery at play here, and have no qualms with the derivation of this result. In class we even did examples such as when $A = \mathbb{N}\backslash\{3\}$, and I have no problem. However, now I'm confronted with this problem: Determine the number $c_n$ of compositions of $n$ in which there are no consecutive pairs of even parts using generating functions. ...and I'm completely and utterly lost. I don't know where to start. I can't use the same idea as in the previous proof, since we can't describe the set $S$ of partitions with no consecutive even parts as a set of combinations with elements in some $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. I do know that  $$ c_n = [x^n]\sum_{s\in S} x^{w(s)} $$ but from here I have absolutely no ideas. I have to know something about $S$ in a sense, so I can manipulate this generating function and turn it into something else, but exactly what piece of information I need to know about $S$ is beyond me. Maybe a bijection from $S$ onto itself in some weird way, like $A\mapsto A\times B\backslash C$ where $B$ and $C$ are other sets, and then I can derive a functional equation for this generating function? As for what bijection I even could derive, I have absolutely no idea. I've listed out the elements of $S$ for $n = 0$ to $7$ and can't see any patterns.
