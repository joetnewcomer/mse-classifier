1,Solving for angles in a Tetrahedron,Solving for angles in a Tetrahedron,,"I have a triangulation problem I'm trying to solve for a work project. It's been ages since I've taken a math class so assume that I've forgotten everything because I probably have. So here's the situation: I have a tetrahedron ($ABCD$). I know all three angles ($\angle ABC \angle ACB \angle BAC$) and the lengths of all three sides ($\overline{AB}$  $\overline{AC}$ $\overline{BC}$) of the base ($\triangle ABC$). I know all three angles around the peak ($D$) ($\angle ADB$ $\angle ADC$ $\angle BDC$). With that I can deduce the dihedral angles between three faces ($\triangle ABD$ to $\triangle ACD$, $\triangle ACD$ to $\triangle BCD$, $\triangle ABD$ to $\triangle BCD$). How can I solve for the lengths of any of the sides between the base and the peak ($\overline{AD}$ $\overline{BD}$ $\overline{CD}$), or any of the remaining angles ($\angle ABD$ $\angle BAD$ $\angle ACD$ $\angle CAD$ $\angle BCD$ $\angle CBD$)? It seems to me with a base having a fixed, known shape and size, and fixed angles around the fourth point, it should be possible to directly deduce the rest of the angles and side lengths.

(A variety of different shapes, I know.  A classification or catalog of them might answer the question, or maybe a theoretical statement of some kind.) The domain can be regarded as a circle $[0,2\pi]$ by identifying the endpoints, and the codomain is the circle $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$, the one-point compactification of the line.  Hence the graphs live on a torus .  The sine and cosine wind once around the torus the horizontal (domain) way and zero times around the vertical (codomain) way.  The tangent goes around once the horizontal way and twice the vertical way.  The secant and cosecant do as the sine and cosine do, but they're on the other half of the torus (and it is just half if you map the circle $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$ to the ordinary Euclidean circle in a way that takes $0, 1, \infty, -1$ in that order to points differing by an arc of a quarter of the whole circle. So I looked at the graph of $\theta\mapsto\sec\theta+\csc\theta$.  I was a bit startled.  Superficially, it looked something like this: Between $0$ and $\pi/2$ it looks similar to $2\sqrt{2}\csc(2\theta)$, i.e. it came down from $+\infty$ and went back up; Between $\pi/2$ and $\pi$, it looks similar to one period of the tangent function, again of course with twice the frequency of the natural tangent function; Between $\pi$ and $3\pi/2$ it looks like the other lobe of the cosecant graph; Between $3\pi/2$ and $2\pi$ it looks like minus the tangent function, but again with twice the frequency. But the actual shape of those lobes resembling the secant graph is not identical to the shape of the actual secant graph.  And similarly with the tangent, although plotting the values of a tangent function having a zero at $3\pi/4$ against those of $\sec+\csc$ on that interval gives something remarkably close to a straight line, although visibly different from it. So its windings around the torus are thus: It goes once around in the horizontal direction, and a net zero times around in the vertical direction.  But in winding zero times around the circle $\mathbb R\cup\{\infty\}$, it starts and $\infty$, goes almost half way around in the negative direction, then goes in the positive direction almost two whole turns around the circle before turing around and heading back the other way.","What do graphs of rational functions of sine and cosine generally look like?

Regardless of the relation between the sides ($=$,$<$,$>$,$≤$ or $≥$), adding and subtracting doesn't change the relation. Unlike dividing or multiplying by a negative number (which inverses the sign), adding or subtracting doesn't change the sign. 2) If you do work on both sides, and you do arrive at a valid equation (i.e. the Pythagorean identity), can't you prove the initial equation by working backwards?

Let $y$ represent a proven identity such as the Pythagorean identity.

However, if you start at $y$, and do the above steps backward (Subtract $c$, divide by $b$ and multiply by $a$) won't you arrive at $x$? Therefore if you do arrive at $y$ through working on both sides of $x$, shouldn't $x$ be valid since you can arrive at $x$ by working backwards starting at $y$? 3) Some trigonometric identities are extremely complicated and take a while to solve.

In my case, the general solution is crucial because I'm applying this to an optimization where I can't afford to have an additional dimension to be optimized. This problem can be visualized as the intersection of two sine waves. A simplified version of the problem (when a = 1) could be easily solved with the sum-to-product identity: and etc... But for the time being, the only valid assumption in my case is that b is rational",a \sin(bx + c) \le 1 \sin(bx + c) = \sin(x) 0 = \sin(bx + c) - \sin(x) 0 = 2 \cos(\frac{x(b + 1) + c}{2})\sin(\frac{x(b - 1) + c}{2}) 0 = \cos(\frac{x(b + 1) + c}{2}) 0 = \sin(\frac{x(b - 1) + c}{2}),['trigonometry']
