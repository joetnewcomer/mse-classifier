0,Function is Continuous When Restricted to Closed Sets Which Cover the Space,Function is Continuous When Restricted to Closed Sets Which Cover the Space,,"Suppose that $\{A_i\}$ is a finite collection of closed sets in $X$ such that $X = \bigcup A_i$, and $f : X \to Y$ restricted to each $A_i$ is continuous. Then $f$ is continuous. Okay. The base case ($n=2$) is just the pasting lemma. I am having a little trouble with the inductive case, specifically with what the hypothesis is and how to deal with continuity with respect to subspaces. I believe the inductive hypothesis is to assume that any function over a topological space that is the union of $n-1$ closed sets such that the function restricted to each of these $n-1$ closed set is continuous must be continuous over the whole space. Then I assume I have a topological space $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$, where each $A_i$ is closed, and a function $f : X \to Y$ such that $f|_{A_i}$ is continuous for each $i$. Thus $X = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i \cup A_n$, where $C = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i$ is closed since it is a finite union of closed sets. If I can show $f|_C$ is continuous, then I simply apply the pasting lemma to finish the problem. Give $C$ the subspace topology, and notice that each $A_i$ is closed in $C$. Thus we have a topological space $C$ that is the union of $n-1$ closed. But do I still have continuity $f$ restricted to $A_i$ since I am no longer considering them subspaces of $X$ but of $C$? When one says $f|_{A_i}$ is continuous, is one saying that $f$ is continuous when restricted to $A_i$ and $A_i$ is given the subspace topology? EDIT: I think I figured out the lemma I need. Claim: Let $A$ and $C$ be subspaces of $X$ such that $A \subseteq C$. Topologize $C$ with subspace topology with respect to $X$. Then the subspace topology on $A$ as a subspace of $X$ (call it $\tau_X$) is the same as the subspace topology of $A$ as a subspace of $C$ (call it $\tau_C$). Proof: Let $U$ be open in $X$. Then $A \cap U$ is some open set in $A$ as a subspace of $X$. Since $C$ is a subspace of $X$, $C \cap U$ is open in $C$ as a subspace of $X$. Then $A \cap (C \cap U) = (A \cap C) \cap U = A \cap U$ is open in $A$ as a subspace of $C$, thereby proving $\tau_X \subseteq \tau_C$. Now let $O$ be some open set in $C$ as a subspace of $X$. Then $A \cap O$ is some open subset of $A$ as a subspace of $C$. But $O = C \cap U$ for some open set in $X$. Therefore $A \cap O = A \cap (C \cap U)= A \cap U$, which is also open in $A$ as a subspace of $X$. Hence $\tau_C \subseteq \tau_X$ Kind of obvious.

1,How to correctly understand submanifolds?,How to correctly understand submanifolds?,,"First a disclaimer: the particular interest that led me to this is the use of submanifolds in General Relativity, in particular spacelike hypersurfaces. This idea used a lot in GR led me to seek a better understanding of submanifolds. So, the point is that up to now my understanding of submanifolds has been quite ""informal"", mostly based on examples, and most examples are something like: pick a manifold $M$ a chart $(x,U)$ and hold some coordinate functions constant. This defines a submanifold. Now this is not a good understanding of the subject. So searching for a formal understanding I've tried Spivak's book. He defines actually four things: Definition 1: A differentiable function $f : M\to N$ is called an immersion if the rank of $f$ is $\dim M$ . Definition 2: A subset $M_1\subset M$ together with a differentiable structure that need not be inherited from $M$ is called an immersed submanifold if the inclusion $i : M_1\to M$ is an immersion. Definition 3: An embedding is an immersion $f: M\to N$ which is injective and a homeomorphism over its image. Definition 4: A submanifold of $M$ is an immersed submanifold $M_1$ such that the inclusion $i : M_1\to M$ is an embedding. Other authors do differently. For example, Sean Carroll in his Spacetime and Geometry says: Consider an $n$ -dimensional manifold $M$ and an $m$ -dimensional manifold $S$ , with $m\leq n$ , and a map $\phi : S\to M$ . If the map $\phi$ is both $C^\infty$ and one-to-one, and the inverse $\phi^{-1} : \phi(S)\to S$ is also $C^\infty$ , then we say that the image $\phi(S)$ is an embedded submanifold of $M$ . If $\phi$ is one-to-one locally but not necessarily globally, then we say that $\phi(S)$ is an immersed submanifold of $M$ . When we speak of ""submanifolds"" without any particular modifier, we are imagining that they are embedded. The major difference here is: for Spivak, submanifolds are subsets obeying certain properties (that is what I would expected), for Carroll, they are other manifolds which we map into subsets, which seems quite odd. Strangely, I've read some authors saying that this is one concept that is really done different by each author. What I find confusing is that the idea of a ""sub-structure"" in general is quite straightforward. In Algebra defining subgroups, vector subspaces and so forth is quite easily done, it is just a subset with a straightforward property that makes it ""inherit"" the structure of the first set. The same happens with topology when defining topological subspaces with the relative topology. Submanifolds seems different. One author resorts to ""external"" sturcture, namely, another manifold. Spivak also says that the ""submanifolds"" might have another differentiable structure. This all confuses me. For example: what if we have a subset and want to inherit the structure of the original manifold? After all that is what is done in all those examples I've mentioned. How to correctly understand submanifolds, the various definitions and the relations between them? Why this is a good definition of submanifold?

4,The Unit Sphere $S^{n-1}$ is Path-Connected,The Unit Sphere  is Path-Connected,S^{n-1},"I am trying to understand Munkres' proof that $S^{n-1}$ is path-connected. Below is a snippet from the book. It's clear to me that $g$ is surjective; and I concur with him with him when he says it is rather easy to show the continuous image of a path-coonected space is path-connected. What is giving me trouble is showing that $g$ is continuous. I tried showing that $g : \mathbb{R}^n_0 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n_0$ is continuous, which would entail that the restriction to $f(\mathbb{R}^n_0) = S^{n-1}$ is continuous. This didn't seem to lead anywhere though. If I am not mistaken, a basis element of $\mathbb{R}^n_0$ is $\prod (a_i,b_i)$, where each interval $(a_i,b_i)$ does not contain $0$. The preimage under $f$ is $$f^{-1}\left(\prod (a_i,b_i)\right) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n_0 ~|~ \frac{x}{||x||} \in \prod (a_i, b_i) \right\} = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n_0 ~|~ x \in \prod (||x||a_i,||x||b_i) \right\}$$ which I can't really make sense of; I can't determine exactly what this set looks like. EDIT: Following the unanamious suggestion, I will attempt to prove that the norm is a continuous function. Note that the norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$ induces the standard euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which in turn induces the standard topology. In a previous exercise, it was shown that the metric is continuous with respect to the topology it induces. With a little thought, we can see that $||x|| = d(x,0)$ and is nothing more than the restriction of a continuous function (i.e., the metric) to $\mathbb{R}^n \times \{0\}^n$, which means the norm is continuous. Having the zero vector, which is a crucial to the above proof, this proof generalizes to all normed vector spaces. I'll have to think about the case in which the normed space isn't a vector space, but I think this gets the job done. Now, in the previous chapter of munkres, I am told that if $f,g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions and $g(x) \neq 0$ for any $x \in X$, then $f/g : X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous.

28,Why do we require $X$ to be Hausdorff when defining $C(X)$?,Why do we require  to be Hausdorff when defining ?,X C(X),"In Efton Park's ""Complex Topological K-theory"", he begins a section by defining the Banach algebra $C(X)$ (continuous functions $f: X \rightarrow \Bbb C$), presupposing that $X$ is Hausdorff and compact. It's obvious why he requires compact: otherwise, the ""norm"" wouldn't necessarily be a norm, as there could be unbounded functions on $X$. But whence the Hausdorff condition?

I would like to prove the following characterisation of Cantor-connectedness: A space $(X,d)$ is Cantor-connected if and only if it cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $d(A,B) > 0.$ I already have the following: We first prove that if $(X,d)$ is Cantor-connected, $X$ cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $d(A,B) > 0.$ Suppose that there exists a partition of $X$ into sets $A$ and $B$ with $d(A,B) > 0.$ Take $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, take $\epsilon > 0$. By the fact that $X$ is Cantor-connected, there exist $a = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n} = b$ in $X$ such that $d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq \epsilon$ for all $i \in \{1, \cdots,n\}$. But then we get $$d(a,b) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq n \epsilon.$$ By arbitrariness of $\epsilon$ we get that $d(a,b) = 0$, hence $d(A,B)=0$. This is a contradiction. Now we show that if $X$ cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ with $d(A,B) > 0$, then $X$ is Cantor-connected. Suppose that $x, y \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrary. Set $x_{0} = x$.

Analogously we find $x_{2} \in X$ such that $d(x_{1},x_{2}) \leq \epsilon.$ This will give us $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots \in X$ with $d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq \epsilon.$ Now we have to prove that after a finite number of steps, we get $x_{n}= y$ and $d(x_{n-1}, x_{n}) \leq \epsilon.$ Can anyone explain to me why the process in the last step stops after a finite number of steps?","For Cantor-connectedness I use the following definition: A $p$-metric space $(X,d)$ is Cantor-connected if for any $\epsilon > 0$, any two points $x, y \in X$ can be connected by an $\epsilon$-chain, i.e., there exist points $x = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n} = y$ in $X$ such that $d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq \epsilon$ for all $i \leq n$. I would like to prove the following characterisation of Cantor-connectedness: A space $(X,d)$ is Cantor-connected if and only if it cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $d(A,B) > 0.$ I already have the following: We first prove that if $(X,d)$ is Cantor-connected, $X$ cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $d(A,B) > 0.$ Suppose that there exists a partition of $X$ into sets $A$ and $B$ with $d(A,B) > 0.$ Take $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, take $\epsilon > 0$. By the fact that $X$ is Cantor-connected, there exist $a = x_{0}, x_{1}, \cdots, x_{n} = b$ in $X$ such that $d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq \epsilon$ for all $i \in \{1, \cdots,n\}$. But then we get $$d(a,b) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}d(x_{i-1},x_{i}) \leq n \epsilon.$$ By arbitrariness of $\epsilon$ we get that $d(a,b) = 0$, hence $d(A,B)=0$. This is a contradiction. Now we show that if $X$ cannot be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$ with $d(A,B) > 0$, then $X$ is Cantor-connected. Suppose that $x, y \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrary. Set $x_{0} = x$. Then there exists $x_{1} \in X$ such that $d(x_{0},x_{1}) \leq \epsilon$. If not, $\{x\}$ and $X \setminus \{x\}$ would form a partition with $d(\{x\}, X \setminus \{x\}) > 0$.

66,Every interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is connected. [Proof clarification],Every interval  is connected. [Proof clarification],I \subset \mathbb{R},"I struggled to understand a part of the following proof. Topological Proof that every Interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ is connected Definition: A topological space is connected if, and only if, it cannot be divided in two   nonempty, open and disjoint subsets, or, similarly, if the empty set and the whole set are the    only subsets that are open and closed at the same time. Proof . Suppose $I = A \cup B$ and $A \cap B = \emptyset$ , $A$ and $B$ are both non-empty and open in the subspace-topology of $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ . Choose $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ and suppose $a < b$ . Let $s := \mathrm{inf}\{ x \in B ~|~ a < x \}$ . Then in every neighborhood of $s$ there are points of $B$ (because of the definition of the infimum), but also of $A$ , then if not $s = a$ , then $a < s$ and the open interval $(a,s)$ lies entirely in $A$ . And so $s$ cannot be an inner point of $A$ nor $B$ , but this is a contradiction to the property that both $A$ and $B$ be open and $s \in A \cup B$ . My Problems I am struggled with the bold parts. Probably because I'm more familiar with metric spaces than with topological spaces. I know that $\forall \epsilon>0, \exists y\in B:s+\epsilon>y$ and this implies that every open ball $\beta (s,\epsilon)$ contains a point of $B$ . Furthermore, if $a=s\in A$ clearly $\beta (s,\epsilon)$ contains a point of $A$ , otherwise, if $a<s$ then $(a,s)\subset A$ which also means that $\beta (s,\epsilon)$ contain a point of $A$ . If this argument is correct, then my problem turns out to be the translation of these ideas of open balls and distances to the topological framework. I have the intuition that he is trying to show that $s$ is a boundary point of $B$ in $I$ . As $A$ and $B$ separates $I$ , $B^c=A$ . So, $s$ can never be (an interior point) either in $A$ or in $B$ .

I think this is the maximal irreducible subset I'm looking for. To show this, let $U,V\subseteq$ be open in $A$. I want to show $U\cap V\neq\varnothing$ but I'm not sure how to do this. It's clear that an open subset of an irreducible set is irreducible, so I could show this if I knew that $U$ and $V$ were both contained in an irreducible set. But I don't know if this is even true. Any hints?","Let $X$ be a topological space. A subset $A$ is irreducible if for every open $U,V\subseteq A$, we have $U\cap V\neq\varnothing$.

95,The cone of a topological space is always path-connected,The cone of a topological space is always path-connected,,"I'm having trouble proving that if $X$ is a topological space, then $C(X)$ (defined as $X \times [0,1] /\sim$ where $(x_1,t_1)\sim (x_2,t_2)$ iff they are equal or $t_1=0=t_2$) is path-connected. I understand the definition and I know I must take two different points in the cone and construct a function from $[0,1]$ to $C(X)$. The problem is that because $C(X)$ is a quotient, then I don't quite see how points look like and how to join them with a path. Thank you.","I'm having trouble proving that if $X$ is a topological space, then $C(X)$ (defined as $X \times [0,1] /\sim$ where $(x_1,t_1)\sim (x_2,t_2)$ iff they are equal or $t_1=0=t_2$) is path-connected.

97,If X is simply-connected then any two paths are homotopic via a homotopy relative to the points where they agree,If X is simply-connected then any two paths are homotopic via a homotopy relative to the points where they agree,,"Let $X$ be a simply-connected space and $f,g:I\to X$ two paths with the same endpoints and $A=\{s\in I:f(s)=g(s)\}$. Since $X$ is simply-connected there is a homotopy $F:I\times I\to X$ relative $\{0,1\}$. The question is: can we pick $F$ relative $A$? I've tried considering the open set $I-A$ which is a countable union of disjoint segments $(a_n,b_n)$. Then one can get a homotopy $F_n:[a_n,b_n]\times I\to X$ from $f|[a_n,b_n]$ to $g|[a_n,b_n]$. One may try to glue all these homotopies (or some sort of modifications) $F_n$ to get $F:I\times I\to X$ (which is defined to be $f(s)$ in $A\times I$) but I'm not sure if $F$ ends up being continuous. Note that this is true for $X\subseteq R^n$ any convex set (just take the linear homotopy). I'm particularly interested in the case where $X=S^2$.","Let $X$ be a simply-connected space and $f,g:I\to X$ two paths with the same endpoints and $A=\{s\in I:f(s)=g(s)\}$.

98,Why does the notion of vanishing at infinity require local compactness|,Why does the notion of vanishing at infinity require local compactness|,,"The definition I know of 'vanishing at infinity' for locally compact topological space is the following: A function $f:X\to (Y,||\cdot||)$ on a locally compact space $X$ is said to vanish at infinity if for every $\epsilon>0$ the set $\{x\in X|\ ||f(x)||\geq\epsilon\}$ is compact. However, I don't understand the necessity of the local compactness of $X$. To me it seems that if we skip that requirement, then on a non-locally-compact space, there will probably be only the null-function which vanishes at infinity, so the whole notion becomes a bit useless, but is still well-defined I think? So can someone elaborate on why this is requirement is necessary? Edit: I don't think it's true that only the null-function would vanish at infinity, but the function would have to be $0$ at non-locally-compact points.","The definition I know of 'vanishing at infinity' for locally compact topological space is the following: A function $f:X\to (Y,||\cdot||)$ on a locally compact space $X$ is said to vanish at infinity if for every $\epsilon>0$ the set $\{x\in X|\ ||f(x)||\geq\epsilon\}$ is compact.
