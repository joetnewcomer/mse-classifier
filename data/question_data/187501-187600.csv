48,Perspective on Differentials Generating Transformations of Functions - with Fourier Transformations $e^{a\partial_x} f(x) = f(x+a)$,Perspective on Differentials Generating Transformations of Functions - with Fourier Transformations,e^{a\partial_x} f(x) = f(x+a),"An analytic function $f(x)$ can be transformed by the exponential of a differential operator. The most known and easiest example is $ e^{a \partial_x} f(x) = f(x+a) $ Generally this is shown by Taylor series. Because $f$ is analytic it has a Taylor series $T^{\infty} [f,a](x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$ . Now the object $e^{a \partial_x}$ is interpreted by Taylor expansion: $e^{a \partial_x} f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a^n}{n!} \partial_x^nf(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}a^n = T^{\infty} [f,x](a+x) = f(x+a)$ This is for example used in Quantum Mechanics: By Noether-Theorem the momentum operator $\hat{p}$ generates translation. In real space representation the momentum operator is a differential operator $\hat{p} = -i\hbar \nabla$ . This leads us to $\psi(x+a) = e^{a \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{p}}\psi(x)$ . The argument can be expanded to more then one dimension and I believe that the factors are simply for dimension and unitarity. From this simple case we can expand to more general differential operators for analytic and invertible functions $g$ : $e^{\frac{d}{dg(x)}}f(x) = f(G(x))$ Using $f(x) = f(g^{-1}(g(x)))$ , we can see that $G(x) = g^{-1}(g(x)+1)$ . Because of Cauchy-Eulers differential equations, we may be interested in $e^{\frac{d}{d(ln(x)/a)}}=e^{ax\frac{d}{dx}}$ . So $G(x) = e^{a( lnx/a +1)}= e^a x$ , and $x \frac{d}{dx}$ gives us scaling instead of translation. Now the main content: I want to present an easier argument for the translation by exponentiation of differentiation and then use the same argument for the scaling operator. Based on the momentum operator argument, I will look at this operator in momentum space ( $k$ -space). As Quantum Mechanics (and Fourier Transform) deals with Schwartz functions, so smooth and rapidly decreasing functions, this argument is just for a (very important) subspace of analytic functions. We need two pieces of information before the argument becomes evident: Be $F(k) = \mathcal{F}(f(x))(k)$ the Fourier transform of f, given it exists and I will be making use of the unitary angular frequency convention. $1. \mathcal{F}(f(x+a))(k) = e^{ i a k} F(k)$ $2. \mathcal{F}(f'(x))(k) = ik F(k) $ $\implies$ $\mathcal{F}(e^{a\frac{d}{dx}} f(x))(k) = e^{a i k }F(k) = \mathcal{F}(f(x+a))(k)  \\ \implies e^{a \frac{d}{dx}} f(x) = f(x+a)$ The last step is also a property of Schwartz functions. That I can transform the exponent as shown can be seen by examining the series representation. I believe this to be a neat proof and would like to have some feedback on the argumentation, possible gaps and additional steps! Now as a last step, the application to the scaling operator. $3. \mathcal{F}(f(a x))(k) = \frac{1}{a} F(\frac{k}{a}), a>0$ $4. \mathcal{F}(xf'(x) )(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \mathcal{F}(x)(k) * \mathcal{F}(f'(x))(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} (i \sqrt{2\pi} \delta'(k) )*(ik F(k) ) = - (kF(k))' = - F(k) - k F'(k) = (-1-k\frac{d}{dk})F(k)$ $\implies$ $ \mathcal{F}(e^{a x\frac{d}{dx}} f(x))(k) = e^{-a-k\frac{d}{dk} }F(k) = e^{-a}F(e^{-a}k) \\ \iff e^{a x\frac{d}{dx}} f(x) = f(e^a x) $ Thanks for reading!

Show  is surjective.,f(f^{-1}(S))=S \iff f,"Below is my attempt at a standard exercise on basic set theory and functions. There are 3 reasons for my request for feedback on my solution: I am self-teaching and that means I often think I am correct when I am not. My solution seems much longer than any exercise I've done so far in Terence Tao's Analysis I which suggests I've missed something important. I am not learning much from the many answers to the same exercise on this site. I want to check my thinking here, which is different from the thinking behind those answers there. (part of) Exercise 3.4.5 from Tao Analysis I 4ed Let $f : X \to Y$ be a function from one set $X$ to another set $Y$ . Show that $f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ for every $S \subseteq Y$ if and only if $f$ is surjective. My Solution Strategy: We need to prove both: Part 1 $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \implies f$ is surjective. Part 2 $f$ is surjective $\implies f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ . Part 1 (proves contrapositive) Let's start with $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \implies f$ is surjective. This is a statement of the form $A \implies B$ , which we'll prove by showing the logically equivalent $\neg B \implies \neg A$ . So, let's consider that $f$ is not surjective. This means there exists an $s \in S$ for some $S \subseteq Y$ , such that $f(x) \neq s$ for all $x \in X$ . The inverse image $f^{-1}(S)$ is, by definition, the set $\{x \in X : f(x) \in S\}$ . If we apply $f$ to the elements of this set, we obtain the set $\{f(x) \in S\}$ . However, this set does not contain $s \in S$ because we have already defined it such that $f(x) \neq s$ for all $x \in X$ . Therefore, $f$ not surjective implies $f(f^{-1}(S)) \neq S$ . This is logically equivalent to $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \implies f$ . Part 2 Now let's show $f$ is surjective $\implies f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ . To do this we need to show that under the assumption $f$ is surjective, both of the following are true: $f(f^{-1}(S)) \subseteq S$ $S \subseteq f(f^{-1}(S))$ Let's start with the first $f(f^{-1}(S)) \subseteq S$ . If $y \in f(f^{-1}(S))$ then $y=f(x)$ for some $x \in f^{-1}(S)$ . By definition $f^{-1}(S)$ is the set $\{x \in X: f(x) \in S\}$ . So if $f(x) \in S$ then $y=f(x) \in S$ . That is, $y \in f(f^{-1}(S)) \implies y \in S$ . This is equivalent to $f(f^{-1}(S)) \subseteq S$ . Note we didn't need $f$ to be surjective for this. Now let's consider $S \subseteq f(f^{-1}(S))$ . Since $f$ is surjective, for every $y \in S$ there exists an $x \in f^{-1}(S)$ such that $f(x)=y$ . Here, $x \in f^{-1}(S)$ gives us $y = f(x) \in f(f^{-1}(S))$ . Hence, $y \in S \implies y \in f(f^{-1}(S))$ . This is equivalent to $S \subseteq f(f^{-1}(S))$ . Having shown both $f(f^{-1}(S)) \subseteq S$ , and $S \subseteq f(f^{-1}(S))$ , we can conclude $f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ . This was under the assumption that $f$ is surjective, so we have $f$ is surjective $\implies f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ . Finally, having shown $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \implies f$ is surjective, and $f$ is surjective $\implies f(f^{-1}(S))=S$ , we can say $f(f^{-1}(S))=S \iff f$ is surjective. $\square$","Below is my attempt at a standard exercise on basic set theory and functions.
