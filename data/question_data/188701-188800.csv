Please shed some light on these matters.","Suppose that $A$ is a infinite subset of $\mathbb{Z}^+$. We construct a bijection $f:\mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow A$ and define $f(n)$ inductively as follows: Base case: Let $f(1)$ be the least element of the set $A$. Inductive step: Suppose that $f(k)$ has been defined for some $k\ge 1$ Let $f(k+1)$ be the least element of the set $\{a\in A | a> f(k)\}$. To see $f$ is a surjection notice that $f(n)\ge n$. Given an element $a\in A$ then let $m$ be the least integer such that $f(m)\ge a$[we must have $m\le a$ since $f(a) \ge a$]. Then, by the definition of $f$ we have $f(m)=a$. I am unable to follow the argument presented for showing that $f$ is a surjection. I can see that $f(n)\ge n$, $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ and can understand the idea of selecting the smallest $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $f(m)\ge a$. But I don't get how we can conclude that $m\ge a$ from knowing that $f(a)\ge a$. Also, from $f(m)\ge a$ how do we conclude that $f(m)=a$ and cannot be $f(m)>a$ (I don't how to use the definition to conclude this).

Thanks a lot in advance! Question: Consider $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x)=x^2$. We know that it is continuous at $a$ for all $a\in\mathbb{R}$. So, for every $a$, for every $\epsilon>0$ there is a $\delta>0$ such that $|x-a|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(a)|<\epsilon$. For $a>1$ and $\epsilon=1$ find the best possible $\delta$. Is this best possible $\delta$ independent of $a>1$.

How do you get these 2 values? The first is $\frac{1}{a+(a^2-1)^{1/2}}$ and the second is $\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$, of which $\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ is the smaller. And I also don't see how one works and the other won't work :/ So any $\delta\le\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ will work, and any $\delta\ge\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ won't work. Thus we clearly cannot find a $\delta$ which works uniformly for all $a>1$. The best $\delta$ goes to $0$ when $a$ gets larger and larger.","I am trying to understand the following problem...

Clearly very small $\delta$'s are fine, until either $a-\delta$ hits $(a^2-1)^{1/2}$ or $a+\delta$ hits $(a^2+1)^{1/2}$. So we have to work out $a-(a^2-1)^{1/2}$ and $(a^2+1)^{1/2}-a$ and our best $\delta$ will be whichever is the smaller of these two numbers. So I understand everything up to here, but I get lost now. How do you get these 2 values? The first is $\frac{1}{a+(a^2-1)^{1/2}}$ and the second is $\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$, of which $\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ is the smaller. And I also don't see how one works and the other won't work :/ So any $\delta\le\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ will work, and any $\delta\ge\frac{1}{(a^2+1)^{1/2}+a}$ won't work. Thus we clearly cannot find a $\delta$ which works uniformly for all $a>1$. The best $\delta$ goes to $0$ when $a$ gets larger and larger.",,"['functions', 'epsilon-delta']"
99,Figuring out when $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$ is increasing and decreasing,Figuring out when  is increasing and decreasing,f(x) = \sin(x^2),"Regarding the function $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$, I'm supposed to figure out when it is increasing/decreasing. So far, I've found the derivative to be $f'(x) = 2x\cos(x^2)$. So long as I can solve the inequality $\cos(x^2) > 0$ I can figure the rest out, but this is where I'm stuck. I've narrowed it down to $-\frac\pi2 < x^2 < \frac\pi2$ meaning $x^2 < \frac\pi2 \pm n2\pi, \ \ n\in \mathbb N$ Then I get $x < \pm \sqrt{\frac\pi2 \pm n2\pi}$ Am I on the right track here? I can't seem to find a path from here.","Regarding the function $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$, I'm supposed to figure out when it is increasing/decreasing.
