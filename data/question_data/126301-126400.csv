His hint goes like this: If $\varphi: G \to H$ has image $M$ not $H$ , use the factor group $H/M$ if $M$ has index $2$ .  Otherwise, let $\operatorname{Perm} H$ be the group of all permutations of the set $H$ , choose three different cosets $M$ , $Mu$ and $Mv$ of $M$ , define $\sigma\in \operatorname{Perm} H$ by $\sigma(xu)=xv$ , $\sigma(xv)=xu$ for $x\in M$ , and $\sigma$ otherwise the identity.  Let $\psi: H \to \operatorname{Perm} H$ send each $h$ to left multiplication $\psi_h$ by $h$ , while $\psi_h'=\sigma^{-1}\psi_h \sigma$ .  Then $\psi \varphi = \psi'\varphi$ , but $\psi\neq \psi'$ The hint makes it seem like this is a very non-trivial result, so I'm wondering why my attempt at a solution below is incorrect: My Solution: Suppose $\varphi: G \to H$ is an epimorphism.  Then define $\pi : H\to H/\varphi[G]$ to be the quotient map, and $\rho: H \to H/\varphi[G]$ to be the zero map (sending all of $H$ to the identity of $H/\varphi[G]$ ).  We have $\pi \circ \varphi = \rho\circ \varphi$ , and so because $\varphi$ is epi, we should have that $\pi = \rho$ . $\pi$ is surjective, so $\rho$ must also be, meaning that $H/\varphi[G]=\{1\}$ , and hence that $H=\varphi[G]$ .  In other words, $\varphi$ is surjective. What am I missing here?  And if this is correct, what is Maclane's intention in proving the result in a less trivial manner?

Otherwise, let be the group of all permutations of the set , choose three different cosets , and of , define by , for , and otherwise the identity.  Let send each to left multiplication by , while .  Then , but The hint makes it seem like this is a very non-trivial result, so I'm wondering why my attempt at a solution below is incorrect: My Solution: Suppose is an epimorphism.  Then define to be the quotient map, and to be the zero map (sending all of to the identity of ).  We have , and so because is epi, we should have that . is surjective, so must also be, meaning that , and hence that .  In other words, is surjective. What am I missing here?

Assume further that $[G:H_1\cap H_2]<p^2$ . Does it follow that $H_2=gH_1g^{-1}$ for some $g\in G$ ? As an alternative goal: if the main ""guess"" fails, will it still follow that $H_1$ and $H_2$ share the same core in $G$ (in other words: $\bigcap_{g\in G}gH_1g^{-1}=\bigcap_{g\in G}gH_2g^{-1}$ ). Either a proof or a counterexample is welcome! My preliminary thoughts: It is impossible to have $H_1\unlhd G$ , as then we would have $G=H_1H_2$ , and the parallelogram law would imply $[G:H_1]=[H_2:H_1\cap H_2]$ . Obviously the same holds for $H_2$ as well, so the two subgroups are self-normalizing in $G$ . The examples I can think of support this. For example, $H_1$ and $H_2$ can be point stabilizers of (the natural action of) $S_p$ , and as the action of $G$ is transitive, they are always conjugate. The intersection $H_1\cap H_2$ has index $p(p-1)<p^2$ . The exact same thing happens, when $G$ is the holomorph $C_p\rtimes C_{p-1}$ ( $C_{p-1}$ identified with $Aut(C_p)$ ). Another example is the five Sylow $2$ -subgroups $H_1,H_2,\ldots, H_5$ of the dihedral group $D_{20}$ of symmetries of a regular $20$ -gon. The Sylow $2$ s are the groups of symmetries of the five embedded squares (see here for a picture). The four rotations by multiples of 90 degrees are in all the $H_i,i=1,2,3,4,5$ , so the intersections are ""large"". Of course, in that case conjugacy also follows from the fact that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are Sylow $2$ -subgroups. If $X$ stands for the set $G/H_1 \times G/H_2$ with $G$ acting by left multiplication, then the assumption on the size of $H_1\cap H_2$ implies that the action is not transitive. Clearly all the orbits of that action have sizes that are multiples of $p$ (the point stabilizers are of the form $xH_1x^{-1}\cap yH_2y^{-1}$ ). If we could show that the smallest orbit must have size $p$ exactly, we would be done.

A minimal generating set of $G$ is a subset of $R$ of $G$ that generates $G$ such that no proper subset of $R$ also generates $G$ . For arbitrary groups is its not true (unlike vector space bases) that two minimal generating sets have the same cardinality. The minimal cardinality of the minimal generating sets of $G$ is denoted by $d(G)$ and the maximal cardinality of the minimal generating sets of $G$ is denoted by $m(G)$ (or sometimes $\mu(G))$ . The standard example for groups that have $d(G)\not=m(G)$ is the symmetric groups. In this case Whiston proved that $m(Sym(n))=n-1$ and it is easily shown that $d(Sym(n))=2$ . In the case when $d(G)=m(G)$ then the following procedure can be used to generate a minimal generating set (all of which have the same number of elements). Randomly choose an element $x\in G$ and let $H=\langle x\rangle$ . Now choose any element in $y\in G$ . If $y\not\in H$ then add $y$ to $H$ . If $y\in H$ then choose another element from $G$ . Continue until $H=G$ . The process will be efficient if there is an efficient way to determine if an element from $G$ is contained within the subgroup $H$ . Here efficient means that the number of operations needed is $O(r(\log(|G|)))$ for some polynomial $r$ when $|G|$ finite and some thing else that is appropriate when $G$ is infinite. If this condition is to difficult then we can substitute a weaker definition. If $G$ satisfies the condition $d(G)=m(G)$ then $G$ is called a $\mathcal{B}$ -group and is said to have the weak basis property. A group $G$ is said to have the basis property if all its subgroups are $\mathcal{B}$ -groups. Apisa and Klopsch proved that if $G$ is finite then $G$ is a $\mathcal{B}$ -group if, and only if, one of the following holds (1) $G$ is a $p$ -group for some prime $p$ ; (2) $G=P\rtimes Q$ where $P$ is a $p$ -group and $Q$ is a cyclic $q$ -group where $p\not=q$ and such that $C_Q(P)\not=Q$ and then $\mathbb{F}_p[Q/C_Q(P)]$ -module $P/\Phi(P)$ is isotypical. A similar result is true for $G$ that have the basis property. These results generalize Burnside's basis theorem which is usually used to show that $p$ -groups have $d(G)=m(G)$ . This means that we need only find an efficient membership test for $p$ -groups and semidirect products $p-$ groups and a cyclic $p$ -group (whether the extra structure needed in the generalization of Burnside's theorem is needed is not clear to me) in order to efficiently find minimal generating sets of finite $\mathcal{B}$ -groups.

Computing packages like GAP will find minimal generating sets of minimal cardinality (i.e. $d(G)$ ) when possible). GAP's manual (as pointed out below) states that there are only efficient methods known for computing minimal generating sets of finite solvable groups and of finitely generated nilpotent groups - but does not provide references.

Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation such that $$(\forall a,a',b,b'\in G)a\sim a', b\sim b' \Rightarrow a*b\sim a'*b'. \tag{*}$$ I.e., the equivalence relation $\sim$ respects the group operation. Question. Does the condition $(*)$ necessarily imply that $$(\forall a,b\in G) a\sim b \Rightarrow a^{-1}\sim b^{-1}, \tag{**}$$ i.e., the relation $\sim$ behaves well w.r.t. the inverses? (If yes, how can we prove this? If it is not true, what are some counterexamples?) This can be expressed also using the corresponding partition. The condition $(*)$ means that $$[a]=[a'], [b]=[b'] \Rightarrow [a*b]=[a'*b'].$$ In the other words, we get a well-defined binary operation on the corresponding partition $G/\sim$ . It is easy to see that in this way we get a monoid. The condition $(**)$ says that the assignment $[a]\mapsto [a^{-1}]$ is also well-defined (=does not depend on the choice of the representative). So if $(**)$ is true, we have also inverses in $G/\sim$ and we get a group. In several places I have seen mentioned in passing that if an equivalence relation fulfills $(*)$ , the condition $(**)$ is true as well. For example, this is mentioned in the Wikipedia article Congruence relation ( current revision ). The definition there includes this condition, but the article mentions that ""this can actually be proven from the other four, so is strictly redundant"". Similarly, if I checked Hungerford's Algebra (proof of Theorem 1.5 on page 27 ) or Jacobson's Basic Algebra I (Definition 1.4 on page 54 and the comments following this definition), they both define congruence only using $(*)$ , but in the proof that we get a group they implicitly use that inverse is well-defined.

(In other words, congruences are equivalence relations which can be multiplied.) After this definition, there is the definition of quotient monoid and an explanation why it actually is a monoid. For groups, the author mentions: We can say a good deal more if $M=G$ is a group and $\equiv$ is a congruence on $G$ . In the first place, in this case the quotient monoid $(\overline G,\cdot,\overline 1)$ is a group, since $\overline a\overline{a^{-1}}=\overline 1=\overline{a^{-1}}\overline a$ .
