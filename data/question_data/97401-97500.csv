11,Questions About the Proof of Cauchy–Pompeiu Integral Formula.,Questions About the Proof of Cauchy–Pompeiu Integral Formula.,,"I am studying function theory in several complex variables and the book I am using is ""Tasty Bits of Several Complex Variables"" by Jiří Lebl: https://www.jirka.org/scv/scv.pdf . At the moment I am reading chapter 4, where he introduces the $\bar{\partial}$ -problem. However, he begins by proving a generalized form of the Cauchy Integral formula and I have some questions about the proof. Theorem: Let $U\subset\mathbb{C}$ be a bounded domain with piecewise $C^1$ -smooth boundary $\partial U$ oriented positively, and let $f:\bar{U}\to\mathbb{C}$ be a $ C^1$ -smooth function. Then for $ z\in U$ : $ f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta+\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_U\dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta\wedge d\bar{\zeta}$ . ""Proof"" : This is how he does it. He begins by fixing $z\in U$ and a small disc $\Delta_r(z)$ such that $\Delta_r(z) \subset\subset U$ . He then applies Stokes Theorem, which gives us $$\int_{\partial U}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta-\int_{\partial \Delta_r(z)}\frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta=\int_{U\backslash\Delta_r(z)}d\Big ( \frac{f(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta \Big )=\int_{U\backslash\Delta_r(z)}\dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{\zeta}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\bar{\zeta}\wedge d\zeta.\quad\quad\quad (*)$$ The above equation begs us to let $r$ tend to $0$ . If we manage to get anything out of this, we are done. Notice that $\dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{\zeta}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}$ is integrable over all of $U$ (this follows from an exercise right before the proof). Therefore $$\lim_{r\to 0}\int_{U\backslash\Delta_r(z)} \dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{\zeta}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\bar{\zeta}\wedge d\zeta=\int_{U} \dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{\zeta}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\bar{\zeta}\wedge d\zeta=-\int_{U} \dfrac{\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{\zeta}}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}d\zeta \wedge d\bar{\zeta},$$ where we used the asymmetry of the operator $\wedge$ in the last equality. As a last step.

I found this on wikipedia: Stokes' theorem says that the integral of a differential form ω over the boundary of some orientable manifold Ω is equal to the integral of its exterior derivative dω over the whole of Ω, i.e., $$\int_{\partial\Omega}\omega=\int_{\Omega}d\omega.$$ Is it the above I am using in some way, if so, could you please tell me how this is being used? Also, as a bonus question, I do not see why we choose a small disc $\Delta_r(z)\subset\subset U$ . But perhaps this will be answered at the same time as the explanation of Stokes Theorem. (2) He argues that the second equality in $(*)$ follows since holomorphic derivatives in $\zeta$ will have a $d\zeta$ and when we wedge with $d\zeta$ we just get zero. I, honestly, do not understand what I just wrote. Can someone explain to me what this means or give another argument why the second equality is true?

I don't know if this is correct or not and what about the set of points $z$ that $f'(z) = 0$ ??? thank you .","I want to show that if $G$ is a region and suppose that $ f: G \to \mathbb{C}~$   is analytic such that $f(G)$ is a subset of a circle, then $f$ is constant. in the section with this exercise, I learn that an analytic function preserves angles btw curves if $f'(z) \neq 0 $ and Mobius transformation. My attempt is that let $ A = \{z \in G : f'(z) \neq 0 \} $.  Then for any $z_o \in A $ , since $f$ is continuous and since $ f(G)$ is a subset of a circle, then the angle of the images of any two curves thru $z_o$ is $ 0, \pi$.  But  $f$ preserve angle so the only way this is possible is if $ f$ is constant on the set $A$. I don't know if this is correct or not and what about the set of points $z$ that $f'(z) = 0$ ??? thank you .",,['complex-analysis']
