1,What's the smallest set that covers $\mathbb{B}^n$ with at most one XOR operation?,What's the smallest set that covers  with at most one XOR operation?,\mathbb{B}^n,"More specifically, what's the smallest set of $n$ -bit binary numbers, $X\subset \mathbb{B}^n$ , such that every $n$ -bit binary number can be obtained from $X$ by at most one XOR operation. Equivalently, the smallest set $X\subset \mathbb{F}_2^n$ such that for any $y\in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ , either $y\in X$ or there exists $x_1, x_2\in X$ such that $y=x_1+x_2$ . For $n=4$ , the set $$X=\{1000, 0100, 0010, 0001, 1111\}$$ is smallest. I'd like to know what the smallest such $X$ is for $n=10$ . For my own attempts, I tried at least to bound the size of $X$ from below. Since if $|X|=k$ , then we can get at most $k+\binom{k}{2}=\frac{k^2+k}{2}$ distinct values from at most one XOR operation (or any binary operation for that matter). And since these values must cover all of $\mathbb{B}^n$ , there must be at least $2^n$ of them. Well, $2^n-1$ actually; this is being used for a data encoding experiment and we don't have to bother about generating $\vec{0}$ from $X$ . Working through the scratch, I found that $$k\ge\frac{-1+\sqrt{2^{n+3}-7}}{2}$$ which tells us that $k\ge 5$ for $n=4$ and thus the set above is smallest. For $n=5$ the corresponding bound is $|X|=k\ge 8$ but with a brute-force search, the only solution I found was with $|X|=9$ . In particular, $$X=\{10000, 01000, 00100, 00010, 00001, 11111, 11000, 10100, 01100\}$$ For $n=10$ , the case I'm interested in, the bound is $|X|\ge 45$ but computer searches only yielded a solution with $|X|=65$ . So I'm wondering, what can I do to find such sets other than brute search? One attempt that stumped me was to start by duplicating some of the binary numbers from the $n=5$ solution as follows: $$1000010000, 0100010000, 0010010000, 0001010000, 0000110000, 1111110000,$$ $$1000001000, 0100001000, 0010001000, 0001001000, 0000101000, 1111101000,$$ $$...$$ $$1000011111, 0100011111, 0010011111, 0001011111, 0000111111, 1111111111.$$ So this gives us a starting point of 36 binary which carry over some of the properties of the $n=5$ solution. But even these have some redundancy that the smaller solution didn't, like $$1000010000+0100001000=1000001000+0100010000=1100011000$$ And obviously, if we're trying to get as many distinct numbers as possible out of $X$ , we want to minimize pairs like this with the same sum. But even then, I wasn't sure how to add more elements to $X$ here. Another thought I had was to start with 11 elements in $X$ : $$1000000000, 0100000000, 0010000000, ..., 0000000010, 0000000001, 1111111111$$ This would take care of all 1-token, 2-token, 9-token, and 10-token binary numbers (as I've been calling them). My hope from here was that 4-token numbers could be added in strategically. They could generate all 8-token codes codes by pairing with each other, all 6 token codes by pairing with $1111111111$ , all 3-token and 5-token codes by pairing with the 1-token codes. But this would still miss 7-token codes entirely. I don't need the optimal solution; even knocking that $|X|=65$ down to a 60 or a 55 would be great.","More specifically, what's the smallest set of -bit binary numbers, , such that every -bit binary number can be obtained from by at most one XOR operation.

Let X be the expected value of the number of days which elapse before there are no longer positive integers on the board. Estimate $X$ The answer is given to be $120.7528$ . I solved it in the below manner and wonder if it is right. Let $X_i$ be a random variable denoting number of trials required to hit 0.  The discrete values it can take are $(1,2,.. i,0)$ where I club all non positive integers on trials to 0. For $X_1$ , the sample space is ${0,1}$ . Actually, it should be represented by hypergeometric distrbution with the teacher striking down each integer by 1.

35,Optimizing a winning strategy for a quick tabletop game,Optimizing a winning strategy for a quick tabletop game,,"A friend of mine recently shared the following puzzle with me: Puzzle: A circular turntable is divided into four congruent quadrants by two perpendicular lines.  (Think of a circle in the $xy$ -plane centered at the origin and divided into quadrants by the coordinate axes.)  In each quadrant is a quarter covered by an upside down opaque cup.  The cups are identical in appearance as are their relative positions in each quadrant.  A ""move"" consists of removing any two cups and then changing the orientations (heads up\tails up) of none, one, or both of the corresponding coins.  After the move you turn your back and a judge inspects the coins under the remaining two cups.  You ""win"" if all four coins are oriented the same, either all heads up, or all tails up.  If you fail to win on a move then the judge replaces the cups back in their original (indistinguishable) positions over the (currently oriented) coins and gives the turntable a spin.  When it stops rotating you turn back around and are allowed another move.  Prove that you can win in at most five moves. After toying around with this puzzle for a bit, I was able to come up with three different solutions, all of which involved 5 moves.

For for a four player game 4 dice with 4 sides each (d4 in gamers' parlance). Now that would appear to present $n^n$ permutations.

72,Coupon Collectors Problem with Packets: Clarifying Wikipedia,Coupon Collectors Problem with Packets: Clarifying Wikipedia,,"The Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) is very useful in many applications. However, the ""default"" CCP is relatively simple: suppose you have an urn containing $n$ pairwise different balls. Now you want to draw a ball from the urn with replacements until you have seen each of the $n$ balls at least one. Now you can compute the average waiting time to get the number of draws overall needed by the formula \begin{align} \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i] = nH_n \end{align} where $H_n$ is defined as the harmonic series and $\mathbb{E}$ is the expected value. Also, the random variable $X$ is defined as the random number of draws you have to make in order to get all $n$ balls at least once. $X_i$ denotes the additional number of draws one has to make in order to get from $i-1$ different balls to $i$ different balls drawn. Additionally, each ball has an equal probability of $1/n$. Now consider an advanced CCP question: how does the formula change in case you want to draw $p\geq 1$ pairwise different balls (instead of only one as in the default CCP) per draw, called packets ? In other words: Given an urn containing $n$ balls, how many balls do I need to draw in order to get all $n$ balls when drawing always $p\geq 1$ (pairwise different) balls out of the urn? The set of balls is drawn with replacement. (Therefore all balls of one package are different, but different packages can contain same balls.) An answer gives this paper on top of page 20 , and also this german lecture gives an answer on slide 229, 14.7b) .

However, the ""default"" CCP is relatively simple: suppose you have an urn containing $n$ pairwise different balls. Now you want to draw a ball from the urn with replacements until you have seen each of the $n$ balls at least one. Now you can compute the average waiting time to get the number of draws overall needed by the formula \begin{align} \mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[X_i] = nH_n \end{align} where $H_n$ is defined as the harmonic series and $\mathbb{E}$ is the expected value. Also, the random variable $X$ is defined as the random number of draws you have to make in order to get all $n$ balls at least once. $X_i$ denotes the additional number of draws one has to make in order to get from $i-1$ different balls to $i$ different balls drawn. Additionally, each ball has an equal probability of $1/n$. Now consider an advanced CCP question: how does the formula change in case you want to draw $p\geq 1$ pairwise different balls (instead of only one as in the default CCP) per draw, called packets ? In other words: Given an urn containing $n$ balls, how many balls do I need to draw in order to get all $n$ balls when drawing always $p\geq 1$ (pairwise different) balls out of the urn? The set of balls is drawn with replacement. (Therefore all balls of one package are different, but different packages can contain same balls.)
