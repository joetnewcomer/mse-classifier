2,Maximal Non-Hausdorff Compactification,Maximal Non-Hausdorff Compactification,,"I have recently started to read about compactifications of topological spaces, however I would like to clear my mind on a few things. For starters, I am interested in generic topological spaces (not necessarily Tychonoff) although I imagine that not much can be said without imposing restrictions of some sort. Given a topological space $X$ , a $\textbf{compactification}$ (for me) is a $\textbf{compact}$ (not necessarily Hausdorff) space $X^*$ together with a continuous embedding $\phi:X\rightarrow X^*$ such that $\phi(X)$ is dense in $X^*$ . Now, I know a compactification always exists: either $X$ is already compact or we can consider the Alexandroff one-point extension, so that the Corona set $X^*\setminus X$ is, resp., empty or only contains one point. On the other side of the spectrum, there is the Stone-Čech compactification, which is in some sense the largest among Hausdorff compactifications (which exists if and only if the original space is Tychonoff), and this sense is made precise by its universal property. My question is now as follows: If $X$ is a generic topological space, is there any compactification which satisfies a similar universal property* (so that it can be thought as the biggest compactification and not just the biggest among the Hausdorff ones) ? Related to this, if $X$ is indeed Tychonoff and this ""biggest"" compactification exists (at least for specific $X$ ), does it coincide with the Stone-Čech one? Notes: As I understand the matter so far, I'm aware that one can carry out the Stone-Čech construction in general, but for non-Tychonoff spaces the map $\phi$ will not be an embedding. This is not what I'm looking for (at least for now) since I'm interested in not dropping the embedding requirement, and the same for the density one. I am not expecting any kind of constructional result (at least in general), the only issues of the sort that I'm usually interested in are foundational (e.g., does this need some version of the Axiom of Choice?). Any reference or direction is highly appreciated. *Edit for clarity: Honestly I'm not completely sure what the universal property would look like in general, but I mean something on the line of: for any topological space $Y$ and continuous map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ there is a unique (perhaps modulo some equivalence relation) continuous map $f^*:X^*\rightarrow Y$ such that $f^*\circ\phi=f$ .","I have recently started to read about compactifications of topological spaces, however I would like to clear my mind on a few things.

3,The Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces (Understanding theorem statement),The Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces (Understanding theorem statement),,"I am reading Introduction to Topological Manifolds by Lee, and I have a question about the statement of Theorem 3.41 (Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces) on page 64: Theorem 3.41 (Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces) Suppose that $(X_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}$ is an indexed family of topological spaces, and $Y$ is any topological space. A map $f: \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha} \to Y$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each $X_{\alpha}$ is continuous. The disjoint union topology is the unique topology on $\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ with this property. My questions: Since the $X_{\alpha}$ 's are not subsets of $\bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ , the statement the "" $f: \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha} \to Y$ is continuous if and only if its restriction to each $X_{\alpha}$ is continuous "" cannot be literally true. In a preceding paragraph, the author says, For each $\alpha \in A$ , there is a canonical injection $\iota_{\alpha}: X_{\alpha} \to \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ given by $\iota_{\alpha}(x) = (x,\alpha)$ , and we usually identify each set $X_{\alpha}$ with its image $X_{\alpha}^{*} = \iota_{\alpha}(X_{\alpha})$ . Based on the above line about ""identifying"" $X_{\alpha}$ with $X_{\alpha}^{*}$ , my best guess is that the author means the following: $$ f: \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha} \to Y \text{ is continuous iff }\; f|_{X_{\alpha}^{*}}: X_{\alpha}^{*} \to f(X_{\alpha}^{*}) \; \text{is continuous for all } \alpha \in A. \hspace{1cm} (\dagger) $$ Is this the correct interpretation? If $(\dagger)$ is correct, then what are the topologies on $X_{\alpha}^{*}$ and $f(X_{\alpha}^{*})$ assumed to be? Without knowing the topologies on the domain and range of $f|_{X_{\alpha}^{*}}$ , the statement "" $f|_{X_{\alpha}^{*}}$ is continuous"" is ambiguous to me. In looking at this very similar question (where they consider the case where $f$ is an identity map), according to Brian M. Scott, ""the subspaces are assumed to have their given topologies."" How then is the topology on $X_{\alpha}^{*}$ , call it $\tau_{\alpha}^{*}$ , related to the ""original"" topology, call it $\tau_{\alpha}$ , on $X_{\alpha}$ ?  The discussion in that post omitted the $*$ notation, which left me a little confused.

It would help greatly to have an answer that uses the most precise notation possible (even if it's  clunky!); I find the whole ""identify each $X_{\alpha}$ with its image $X_{\alpha}^{*}$ "" to lead to ambiguity and confusion... Update 11/21/22: Thanks to drhab and  Paul Frost for confirming that $\tau_{\alpha}^{*} = \{B \times \{\alpha\}: B \in \tau_{\alpha} \}$ . Here is a (very pedantic) proof of this fact. Proposition. Let $(X_{\alpha},\tau_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}$ be an indexed collection of topological spaces, let $X := \bigsqcup_{\alpha \in A} X_{\alpha}$ , and let $\tau := \left\{B \subseteq X: \iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(B) \in \tau_{\alpha} \text{ for all } \alpha \in A  \right\}$ be the disjoint union topology on $X$ , where $\iota_{\alpha}: X_{\alpha} \to X$ is the canonical injection $\iota_{\alpha}(x) = (x,\alpha)$ . Let $\tau_{\alpha}^{*}$ denote the subspace topology on $X_{\alpha}^{*} := \iota_{\alpha}(X_{\alpha})$ ; that is, $\tau_{\alpha}^{*} := \{ X_{\alpha}^{*} \cap B: B \in \tau \}$ . Then \begin{align*}     \tau_{\alpha}^{*} = \{U \times \{\alpha\}: U \in \tau_{\alpha} \}. \end{align*} Proof . Fix $\alpha \in A$ and let $V_0 \in \tau_{\alpha}^{*}$ . Then $V_0 = X_{\alpha}^{*} \cap U_0$ for some $U_0 \in \tau$ . Then \begin{align*}     V_0 &= \iota_{\alpha}(X_{\alpha}) \cap \iota_{\alpha}(\iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_0))  \\[4pt]       &= \iota_{\alpha}(X_{\alpha} \cap \iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_0)) && (\text{since } \iota_{\alpha} \text{ is injective}) \\[4pt]       &= (X_{\alpha} \cap \iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_0)) \times \{\alpha\}. \end{align*} Now $X_{\alpha} \in \tau_{\alpha}$ by the fact that $\tau_{\alpha}$ is a topology on $X_{\alpha}$ , and $\iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_0) \in \tau_{\alpha}$ by the fact that $U_0 \in \tau$ . Therefore, $X_{\alpha} \cap \iota_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_0) \in \tau_{\alpha}$ , and so $V_0 \in \{U \times \{\alpha\}: U \in \tau_{\alpha}\}$ . This proves that $\tau_{\alpha}^{*} \subseteq \{U \times \{\alpha\}: U \in \tau_{\alpha}\}$ . Now suppose $V_0 \in \{U \times \{\alpha\}: U \in \tau_{\alpha} \}$ . Then $V_0 = U_0 \times \{\alpha\}$ for some $U_0 \in \tau_{\alpha}$ . Now note that \begin{align*}         \iota_{\beta}^{-1}(V_0) = \iota_{\beta}^{-1}(U_0 \times \{\alpha\}) =          \begin{cases}             U_0 & \text{if } \beta = \alpha, \\[2pt]             \emptyset & \text{if } \beta \neq \alpha.         \end{cases} \end{align*} Since $U_0 \in \tau_{\beta}$ when $\beta = \alpha$ , and since $\emptyset \in \tau_{\beta}$ for all $\beta$ , we have $\iota_{\beta}^{-1}(V_0) \in \tau_{\beta}$ for all $\beta \in A$ . Therefore, $V_0 \in \tau$ . It follows that $V_0 \in \tau_{\alpha}^{*}$ . [This is by the following fact: If $U$ is a subspace of $S$ , and $S$ is a subspace of $X$ , then a subset of $S$ that is open in $X$ is also open in $S$ .] This shows that $\{U \times \{\alpha\}: U \in \tau_{\alpha} \} \subseteq \tau_{\alpha}^{*}$ , which completes the proof. $\qquad \square$","I am reading Introduction to Topological Manifolds by Lee, and I have a question about the statement of Theorem 3.41 (Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces) on page 64: Theorem 3.41 (Characteristic Property of Disjoint Union Spaces) Suppose that is an indexed family of topological spaces, and is any topological space.

9,Are there theories about inverse (or at least adjoint) functor Top -> Diff of the forgetful functor Diff -> Top?,Are there theories about inverse (or at least adjoint) functor Top -> Diff of the forgetful functor Diff -> Top?,,"Several general sources ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_topological_spaces , https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Topology/Manifolds/Categories_of_Manifolds ) mention the forgetful functor from category of manifolds M (or differential manifolds Diff) to the category of topological spaces Top: Diff -> Top. My question is about the inverse (or even adjoin?) functor Top -> Diff? Does math say something about it, is there theories about it? Some algorithms, that allow to list such manifolds. Just some hints what is happening about this functor? https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/convenient_categories_of_smoot.html is one dicussion that mentions the problems of defining categories of manifolds and scarcely mentions the inverse functor in which I am interested. I have neural network applications in mind. From the one hand there is topological approaches to model theories (e.g. sheaves for HOL by Awodey), so, the mapping theory <-> topological spaces has been taken care for. From the other hand all the empirical data of the functioning of the neural network are point clouds.

Then $J$ when restricted to its image is a homeomorphism which sends open/close/compact set to open/close/compact set. By Kakutani's theorem, it's enough to prove that $B_E:= \{x\in E \mid |x| \le 1\}$ is compact in $\sigma(E, E')$ . Because $J$ (restricted to its image) is a homeomorphism, it suffices to show that $J[B_E]$ is compact in the weak $^\star$ topology $\sigma(E'', E')$ . By Banach–Alaoglu theorem, $B_{E''} := \{\varphi \in E'' \mid \| \varphi \| \le 1\}$ is compact in $\sigma(E'', E')$ .

14,"Space $W$ of null homotopic maps $g \in Hom(S^1, S^1)$ with $g(1)=1$ is contractible.",Space  of null homotopic maps  with  is contractible.,"W g \in Hom(S^1, S^1) g(1)=1","This is the claim the proof of which I can't fully understand. In my question $S^1$ is defined as subset of complex numbers of unit magnitude. The proof goes as follows: We can obtain a bijection $V \to W$ , where $V$ is a vector subspace (and thus contractible) of $Hom(S^1, \mathbb{R})$ of functions $f$ with $f(1)=0$ . Bijection is obtained by composing with the function $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1; x \mapsto \exp(2\pi i x)$ . Function that composes with $p$ on left is denoted as $p_*$ . We want to show that this bijection is open, that is, a homeomorphism. Since it is also a group homomorphism, it suffices to check that an open neighborhood of a neutral element is mapped to an open neighborhood of a neutral element. It is enough to consider sets of form $C(K, U)$ , where $K \subseteq S^1$ is compact and $U \subseteq (-1, 1)$ is an open neighborhood of $0$ . Since $p$ is open, then $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ (why?) is open in $S^1$ . It holds that $p_* C(K, U) = C(K, p(U))$ because of the initial conditions , and it is open. $C(K, U)$ denotes a subbasic open set in compact-open topology. $Hom(S^1, \mathbb{R})$ is a group with pointwise addition, and $Hom(S^1, S^1)$ is a group with pointwise multiplication. Neutral elements in each are constant maps to $0$ and $1$ respectively. I can also prove $W$ is a subgroup of $Hom(S^1, S^1)$ . $p_*$ is continuous because domains are locally compact. Firstly, I don't understand why we only consider $U \subseteq (-1, 1)$ . I also think that the claim that $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ is false, because for it to be true we'd need to have $U \subseteq (-1/2, 1/2)$ . But then we don't consider all possible neighborhoods, and so it doesn't prove that all open sets are mapped to open sets. I also don't get why we need the condition $p(U) \subseteq S^{-1} \setminus -1$ at all. Isn't it enough to just cite that $p$ is open so that $p_* C(K, U) = C(K, p(U))$ is open for an arbitrary $U$ ? And what could possibly initial conditions mean here? Secondly, I'm not really sure why $p_*$ defines a bijection. I think I can argue that null homotopic maps can be lifted, which shows surjectivity, and also that lifts of the same function on differ by an integer constant, so there is only one of them with $f(1)=0$ . Is it enough? By lifting a function $g: X \to S^1$ I mean finding a function $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$ such that $pf=g$ . Two lifts differ by an integer constant because $pf = pf^{\prime}$ implies $pf/pf^{\prime}=1$ , which says that $\exp(2\pi i(f - f^{\prime}))=1$ . I will now write a (special case of) Homotopy lifting property from my textbook that I use for my argument. Let $X$ be a connected topological space, $f: X\to \mathbb{R}$ continuous function and $H: I \times X \to S^1$ a homotopy that starts with $pf$ . Then there is a unique homotopy $F: I\times X \to \mathbb{R}$ that starts with $f$ and $pF = H$ . I used it to say that null homotopic maps can be lifted.

Question: Let X have a countable basis; let A be an uncountable subset of X. Show that uncountably many points of A are limit points of A. Proof: Let X be a topological space with a countable basis.  Let A be an uncountable subset of X. Let A' be the set of limit points of A that are contained within A. Suppose A' is not uncountable. Then A' is countable. Since A is uncountable, we have B = A - A' is non-empty.

Yet A was chosen to be uncountable. So B must be uncountable. So we have B $\subset$ A and B consists of an uncountable number of points each of which is a member of A yet not a limit point of A. Then we for each x $_i$ $\in$ B we can find an open set U $_i$ such that x $\in$ U $_i$ and U $_i$ $\bigcap$ A = {x $_i$ }. Then since U $_i$ is open it must contain some basis element B $_i$ such that x $_i$ $\in$ B $_i$ $\subseteq$ U $_i$ .

Consider that for some x $_n$ and x $_z$ that their corresponding open basis elements B $_n$ and B $_z$ cannot be the same basis elements since if either were, the basis element would contain both x $_n$ and x $_z$ which is not allowed since the points of B are limit points and the open set B $_i$ must only intersect A in one single point, that is x $_i$ . Hence we have an uncountable collection of basis elements in a space that has a countable basis. A contradiction.

88,Proof Verification: Showing that these two product metrics are equivalent.,Proof Verification: Showing that these two product metrics are equivalent.,,"I am working on this problem from Simmons' ""Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis"" (Problem 10-6). Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a finite class of metric spaces with metrics $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$. If $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$, and $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are metrics defined as follows: $$d(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \max d_i(x_i, y_i)$$ $$\bar{d}(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i)$$ then show that the two metric spaces $(X, d)$ and $(X, \bar{d})$ have precisely the same open sets. (Here, $\{x_i\}$ denotes an n-tuple from $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$) Here is my approach: I know a theorem that two metrics are equivalent iff. every open ball in the first metric contains an open ball from the second metric (centred at the same point) and vice-versa. So, let $B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$ be and open ball in $(X, d)$. Here, $B_d(p, r)$ denotes an open ball with respect to metric $d$, centered at p and with radius $r$. Let $\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$, now, we wish to show that $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, s)$ for some $s > 0$ (possibly a function of $r$?). Now, $$\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < nr \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, nr)$$ Similarly, let $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r)$, then, $$\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$$ So, we conclude that the metrics $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are equivalent. I would really appreciate some comments/correction on this proof.

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a finite class of metric spaces with metrics $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$. If $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$, and $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are metrics defined as follows: $$d(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \max d_i(x_i, y_i)$$ $$\bar{d}(\{x_i\}, \{y_i\}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i)$$ then show that the two metric spaces $(X, d)$ and $(X, \bar{d})$ have precisely the same open sets. (Here, $\{x_i\}$ denotes an n-tuple from $X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \dots \times X_n$) Here is my approach: I know a theorem that two metrics are equivalent iff. every open ball in the first metric contains an open ball from the second metric (centred at the same point) and vice-versa. So, let $B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$ be and open ball in $(X, d)$. Here, $B_d(p, r)$ denotes an open ball with respect to metric $d$, centered at p and with radius $r$. Let $\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$, now, we wish to show that $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, s)$ for some $s > 0$ (possibly a function of $r$?). Now, $$\{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < nr \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, nr)$$ Similarly, let $\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r)$, then, $$\{y_i\} \in B_{\bar{d}}(\{x_i\}, r) \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \implies \max d_i(x_i, y_i) < r \\ \implies \{y_i\} \in B_d(\{x_i\}, r)$$ So, we conclude that the metrics $d$ and $\bar{d}$ are equivalent. I would really appreciate some comments/correction on this proof. In particular, I would like to know that when we show an open ball (with respect to first metric) having radius $r$ is contained in an open ball (with respect to second metric) having radius $s$, then, can $s$ be a function of $r$ or must it be constant depending only on the center?

90,On the weak equivalence axiom for non-CW spaces,On the weak equivalence axiom for non-CW spaces,,"A cohomology theory $h^*$ satisfies the weak equivalence axiom (wea) if for every weak homotopy equivalence $f : X \to Y$ there is a (degreewise) isomorphism $h^*(Y)\to h^*(X)$ induced by $f$. There is an exercise in Strom's book that asks to prove that ordinary, represented reduced cohomology $X\mapsto [X, K(G,n)]$ does not satisfy the wea. The counterexample is the following: Let $\mathbb N$ be the discrete set $\{0,1,2,...\}$ and $L$ be the set $\{0\}\cup \{1/n\mid n\ge 1\}\subset \mathbb R$ with the subspace topology. Then there is a map $\mathbb N\to L$ which is a weak homotopy equivalence, but it does not induce isomorphisms in reduced cohomology. My attempt to a proof follows: I want to dot all the i's of this exercise. Any map $\mathbb N\to L$ will be continuous, because $\mathbb N$ is discrete; I think $\varphi : 0\mapsto 0, n\mapsto 1/n$ does the job; to see this let's note that The connected component of $0$ in $L$ is the singleton $\{0\}$. Proof. Easy: connected components form a partition of a space, and every other point $1/n$ has the singleton $\{1/n\}$ as connected self-component. $\square$ Let $X$ be connected; then   $$ [X,L]\cong \hom(X,L)\cong L$$ in the sense that two maps are homotopic iff they are equal, and there are only constant maps. Proof. If $f : X\to L$ does not assume the value $0$, then it factors through a discrete subspace of $L$, and the result follows; if there is $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=0$, then $f(X)$ must be connected and contain $0$, so it must be $\{0\}$. So there are only constant maps: now if $f,g$ are homotopic through $H : X\times [0,1]\to L$, then $f=g$ because $X\times [0,1]$ is connected, and then $H$ must be constant. $\square$ Corollary of 1+2 is that each map $[S^n,\mathbb N]\to [S^n,L]$ is the zero map between homotopy groups, and a bijection on $\pi_0$'s, so the first part of the claim is proved. Now, the map induced on $H^0$'s is not an isomorphism of abelian groups. Proof. Let $f$ be a continuous map $L\to K(G,0)$. Then $f(0)=\lim_{n\to \infty} f(1/n)$, so that $f$ must be eventually constant (its codomain is $G^\delta$, $G$ with the discrete topology). On the other hand, $[\mathbb N, G^\delta]$ is a countable product of copies of $G$, so (for example) the jumping sequence $(0,g,0,g...)$ for $g\neq 0$ does not lie in the image of $\varphi^*$. $\square$ As in every fairy-tale there's a moral in this story: This mess happens because $L$ is not a CW complex (CW's have the discrete topology on 0-skeleta, but $0\in L$ is a limit point). In fact, if the spaces are CW's, then  this pathology disappears: cohomology detects $n$-homotopy equivalences for simply connected spaces. Now for my question(s): 0. A question on definitions. $L$ is not a CW. But it has the weak homotopy type of a CW complex; does this make $L$ ""nice"" in some sense? 1. A metamathematical question. Is there something else to learn from this counterexample? Who's the wisest between homotopy groups and reduced cohomology, or in other words: are $\pi_n$'s unable to see some information that instead $\tilde{H}^n$ does see, and that I should take care of, or rather $\tilde{H}^n$'s are too picky? 2. A more concrete question. Are there cohomology groups of $\mathbb N$ and $L$ different in higher degrees? Better said: how do you (dis)prove that $H^n(L,G)$ is zero for $n\ge 1$? Again, what worries me is that $L$ is not a CW complex, but it does have the weak homotopy type of a CW complex. When I first saw this exercise I was surprised: I bet that the chain map of the singular complexes $C^*(\mathbb N, G)$ and $C^*(L, G)$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
