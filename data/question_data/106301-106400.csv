0,Packing circles in circle vs semicircle vs quarter of circle,Packing circles in circle vs semicircle vs quarter of circle,,"Consider $N$ disjoint circles with radius $1$ packed into a larger  circle $C$. Let $R$ be the smallest possible radius of $C$, allowing  the best packing density. Now take the $N$ unitary circles and try to pack them in two other ways,  again searching the maximal packing density. First, let us pack them  into two disjoint and equal semicircles; then, let us pack them into  four disjoint and equal quarters of circle. Let $R_S$ be the smallest  possible radius of the semicircles, and let $R_Q$ be the smallest  possible radius of the quarters of circle, in both cases allowing the  maximal packing density.  Because halving a packed circle or semicircle alters the best packing disposition (hexagonal) along the division lines, we have $R_Q>R_S>R$. I calculated the differences $(R_S-R)$ and $(R_Q-R_S)$ using the best  packing values available to date for $N\leq400$. The result is shown in  the following figure: Prove or disprove that these differences converge to definite positive  values when $N$ tends to $\infty$. Edit: the plot might suggest some convergence towards positive values. I tried to calculate these values by determining the effect of division lines on packing, and then by focusing on the region of the semicircles nearest to the diameter, and on the regions of the quarter of circles nearest to the radia. Then, I calculated the difference between the uncovered areas over these regions, considering the unitary circles first in the best packing hexagonal arrangement, and then in the ""squared"" arrangement (that could probably be expected at the level of diameter and radii).

2,Difficult extension to a familiar geometry problem,Difficult extension to a familiar geometry problem,,"A familiar geometry problem is to consider an isosceles triangle APB with vertex P 20 degrees, and draw line BM with angle ABM 60 degrees, and M lying on AP,  and line AN with angle BAN 50 degrees and N lying on BP.

But ever since solving it for myself in 1969, after several months of futile struggling with the analogous problem where vertex P is 40 degrees instead of 20, I have been wondering about the following extension: Find all sets of three distinct angles APB, ABM and BAN, all rational multiples of $\pi$, such that angle ANM (and hence all the other angles in the diagram) is also a rational multiple of $\pi$.  This may be too hard -- then find any other such set of angles. [Change after Josh B's comment -- any other such set of angles with the vertex not 20 degees.

13,Proof/Disproof of property of perpendicular lines in the Fibonacci grid,Proof/Disproof of property of perpendicular lines in the Fibonacci grid,,"In my struggle to try to make progress on this question , I am trying to find a proof or counterexample of the following, stronger, statement: Denote by $K$ the subset of the Gaussian integers such that the real and imaginary parts are Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $K = \{ x+iy\; |\; x,y \in \Bbb{F} \}$, where $\Bbb{F}$ is the set of (positive) Fibonacci numbers. Now, $f_1, f_2 \in K$ are such that $\mathrm{Re}\;f_1 > \mathrm{Re}\;f_2$ and $\mathrm{Im}\;f_2 > \mathrm{Im}\;f_1$. This ensures that the line $L_1$ from $f_1$ to $f_2$ has a negative slope in the complex plane. What I want to prove/disprove is this: Draw a line, denoted $L_2$, perpendicular to $L_1$ starting from $f_1$. Then, no matter how long $L_2$ is, it will never contain any point in the set $K$. The figure shows an example where $f_1 = 2+i$ and $f_2 = 1+5i$. Will the line $L_2$ ever hit another red dot no matter how long you go (to the right)? There is one obvious counterexample: If $f_1 = 2+i$ and $f_2 = 1+2i$, $L_2$ will go through the point $3+2i$. This corresponds to the 45-degree case in the question I linked to above, which is a tilted square with the coordinates $2+i, 1+2i, 2+3i, 3+2i$. Another counterexample is the square $(3+i,1+3i,5+3i,3+5i)$ Are there any others? If there aren't, I think the linked question is resolved. Here is what I have done so far: The line $L_1$ has the same slope as the vector $f_2 - f_1$. Rotating this vector 90 degrees clockwise corresponds to a multiplication by $-i$. This will give the following expression for $L_2$ (parametrized by $k$): $$L_2 = f_1 + k(-i)(f_2 - f_1) = f_1(1+ki)-kf_2i$$ Using $f_1 = x_1 + iy_1$ and $f_2 = x_2 + iy_2$ we get $$L_2 = (x_1 + iy_1)(1+ki) - k(x_2 + iy_2) = \underbrace{x_1+k(y_2-y_1)}_{= x_k} + i\underbrace{\left(y_1+k(x_1-x_2)\right)}_{=y_k}$$ Denote the real and imaginary parts of $L_2$ by $x_k$ and $y_k$ respectively. Now, the hypothesis is that there are no $k$ such that $x_k$ and $y_k$ are simultaneously Fibonacci numbers. I don't know if it's useful, but identifying the real and imaginary parts gives $$y_k(y_2-y_1)+x_k(x_2-x_1) = y_1(y_2-y_1)+x_1(x_2-x_1)$$ This is about as far as I have got.

Now, $f_1, f_2 \in K$ are such that $\mathrm{Re}\;f_1 > \mathrm{Re}\;f_2$ and $\mathrm{Im}\;f_2 > \mathrm{Im}\;f_1$. This ensures that the line $L_1$ from $f_1$ to $f_2$ has a negative slope in the complex plane. What I want to prove/disprove is this: Draw a line, denoted $L_2$, perpendicular to $L_1$ starting from $f_1$. Then, no matter how long $L_2$ is, it will never contain any point in the set $K$. The figure shows an example where $f_1 = 2+i$ and $f_2 = 1+5i$. Will the line $L_2$ ever hit another red dot no matter how long you go (to the right)?

For concrete motivation, let's take $V = \mathbb{R}^3$, with some linear operator $T: V \rightarrow V$, and let's assume $T$ can be written as an upper-triangular matrix $M$. Then $T$ stabilizes a complete flag: there's a nested sequence of invariant subspaces $U \subset W \subset V$, with $\dim U = 1$ and $\dim W = 2$. Geometrically,  $T$ fixes a line and a plane containing that line. This already tosses out lots of transformations; I would like to know what possibilities are left. For starters, I think $T$ can't be a rotation around a line contained in $W$, since that would move $W$, and it also can't be a rotation around a line passing through $W$, since that would move $U$; so apparently $T$ can't be a rotation at all (except possibly by $\pi$ or $2\pi$).

52,Constant tensors and covariant derivatives,Constant tensors and covariant derivatives,,"I seem to have trouble with an elementary computation, and figure it may help others if faced with a similar situation.  The basic question is as follows: if I have a tensor field $T$ on some Riemannian manifold $(M,h)$, and I know that $T$ is constant for some choice of local orthonormal frame, does it hold that $$ DT \equiv 0\,, $$ where $D$ is the covariant derivative along a smooth isometrically immersed submanifold of $M$? I think it is only polite to explain the precise situation I am considering, so let me do so here. Let $(N,h)$ be a Riemannian 3-manifold and consider an immersion $f:\Sigma\rightarrow N$ of the surface $\Sigma$.  Equip $\Sigma$ with the pullback of the metric $h$ so that $(\Sigma, f^*h) = (\Sigma, g)$ is a Riemannian 2-manifold.  Let us denote by $\nabla$ the connection on $N$ compatible with $h$ and by $D$ the connection on $\Sigma$ compatible with $g$.  The Christoffel symbols of $\nabla$ we denote by $\Gamma$ and those of $D$ we denote by $\Lambda$. Now assume $\Sigma$ is orientable and let $\nu:\Sigma\rightarrow (T\Sigma)^\perp$ be a choice of unit normal.  Further let us assume that the curvature of $N$ is constant; since $N$ is a 3-manifold, this is the same as assuming that the Ricci curvature tensor $\text{Ric}$ of $N$ is constant. Let us perform our computations in an orthonormal frame $\{\nu,e_1,e_2\}$ which is adapted to the submanifold $\Sigma$. By definition $$ \nabla_{e_k} \text{Ric}(e_i,e_j)  = \partial_k\text{Ric}(e_i,e_j)  - \Gamma_{ki}^l\text{Ric}(e_l,e_j)  - \Gamma_{kj}^l\text{Ric}(e_i,e_l)\,. $$ As far as I can tell, there is no reason that $\Gamma \equiv 0$ in the orthonormal frame we have.  So it seems to me that although the Ricci curvature of $N$ is constant, it's covariant derivative does not vanish in general.  This seems bizarre to me, and is certainly confusing, but not my main question. Restricting the tensor $\text{Ric}$ to $\Sigma$, we can consider $D\text{Ric}$.  In particular, my main question is: $$ \text{Does it hold that $D_{X}\text{Ric}(\nu,\nu) = 0$ for $X\in\{\nu,e_1,e_2\}$}? $$","I seem to have trouble with an elementary computation, and figure it may help others if faced with a similar situation.

However, its range of validity seems to be aspect ratio dependent. For $w/h$ aspect ratio $>> a/b$ , it works for a large range of angles, but for aspect ratio $= 1$ it only works at $45$ degrees. This is easily seen by using $\alpha$ nearly zero (very little rotation), then $\sin\alpha$ becomes nearly zero and $x$ becomes very large, certainly much larger than $a$ . Whereas the correct solution will be nearly the same size as the slightly rotated rectangle. The solution, $x=0.5b/\sin\alpha$ , leads to $y=0.5b/\cos\alpha$ . So when $x=y$ (upper right corner of inner rectangle) and $a=b$ (aspect ratio $=1$ ), we have $\sin\alpha = \cos\alpha$ , which is valid (in the first quadrant) only at $\alpha=45$ degrees. In particular, the limiting angle would appear to occur when $x=a$ , so that $\sin\alpha > 0.5b/a$ .

However, the problem I had in mind came from geometry so I was wondering about other proofs for this problem. Namely: What are other proofs there does not exist a faithful representation $\rho:S_4\rightarrow GL(\mathbb{R}^2)$?",,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'geometry', 'representation-theory']"
