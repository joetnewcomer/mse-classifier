0,Trivialisation of Möbius strip,Trivialisation of Möbius strip,,"I've just started studying Advanced Geometry and I'm in trouble with a (stupid) exercise. It's about finding a trivialisation of the Möbius strip (I'll refer to it as $E $) viewed as a fibre bundle over $S^1$ with fibre any open interval $F\subset\mathbb{R}$. In order to do that, I have to find a projection $\pi:E\rightarrow S^1$ such that there exists an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of the base space $S^1$ and homeomorphisms $\phi_\alpha:\pi^{-1}(U_\alpha)\rightarrow U_\alpha \times F$ (the trivialisation).

First observation: since regularity is hereditary then $V$ is regular. Now let $y \in Y$ and $U$ a neighborhood of $y$. By assumption there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $\overline{V}$ is regular and hence $V$ is regular. Observe $U \cap V$ is a non-empty subset of $V$ and this set is open in $V$ as well. Since $V$ is regular we can find a non-empty subset $S$ of $V$ such that: $S \subseteq \overline{S} \subseteq U \cap V \subseteq U$ But since $V$ is open then $S$ is open in $X$ so the same set $S$ given by regularity of $V$ shows that $U$ is regular as well. Is the above incorrect? Thank you.",,[]

Prove that the graph of $\Gamma$ is a connected set. Is it path-connected? This is what I have so far: Proof $\space$ We first show that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is connected. Assume to the contrary that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is not connected. Then $Gr(\Gamma) = A \cup B$ where $\overline{A} \cap B = \phi$ and $A \cap \overline{B} = \phi$ , $A \neq \phi$ , and $B \neq \phi$ . Since $\Gamma$ is compact- and convex-valued, $\Gamma(x)$ us a closed interval or a singleton for all $x \in [0, 1]$ . Since $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous, $Gr(\Gamma)$ is closed. Let $(x, y)$ be a limit point of $Gr(\Gamma)$ . Without loss of generality, assume $(x, y) \in A$ , where $y \in \Gamma(x)$ . Then $(x, y) \notin \overline{B}$ . Take a sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $x_n \to x$ . Then there exists a subsequence ${x_{n_k}}$ such that $(x_{n_k}, y_{n_k}) \in \overline{B}$ , $y_{n_k} \in \Gamma(x_{n_k})$ , and $x_{n_k} \to x$ . However, no subsequence of $\{y_{n_k}\}$ can converge to $y$ , for otherwise $(x, y)$ would be in $\overline{B}$ . This contradicts the sequential characterization of upper hemi-continuous correspondence. Therefore, $Gr(\Gamma)$ is connected. I would really appreciate it if someone could check if my proof of the connectedness is correct. In addition, I have difficulties to determine whether $Gr(\Gamma)$ is path-connected or not. I tried to use the $Gr(\Gamma)$ = Deleted Comb Space as a counterexample, but it turns out that $Gr(\Gamma)$ is not closed, because its closure is the Comb Space. By the closed-graph theorem, if $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous, $Gr(\Gamma)$ would be closed. Hence $\Gamma$ is not upper hemi-continuous, a contradiction. This is a question about set-valued analysis and topological spaces .

Definition $\space$ Let $\Gamma$ be a mapping of a topological space $X$ into a topological space $Y$ , and let $x_0$ be any point of $X$ .

Lemma $\space$ [Sequential characterization of lower hemi-continuous] A correspondence $\Gamma: X \to Y$ is lower hemi-continuous at $x_0 \in X$ if and only if, for any sequence $\{x_m\}$ converges to $x_0$ and any $y \in \Gamma(x_0)$ , there exists a sequence $\{y_m\}$ converges to $y$ such that $y_m \in \Gamma(x_m)$ for all $x_m$ . Lemma $\space$ [Sequential characterization of upper hemi-continuous] Let $\Gamma: X \to Y$ be a correspondence. If, for every sequence $\{x_m\}$ in $X$ that converges to $x_0 \in X$ and for every sequence $\{y_m\}$ such that $y_m \in \Gamma(x_m)$ , there exists a subsequence of $\{y_m\}$ that converges to a point in $\Gamma(x_0)$ , then $\Gamma$ is upper hemi-continuous at $x_0$ . If $\Gamma$ is compact-valued, then the converse is true. Theorem $\space$ [Closed graph theorem] Let $\Gamma: X \to Y$ be a correspondence. If $\Gamma$ is closed-valued and upper hemi-continuous, then $Gr(\Gamma)$ is closed.","Let be a compact- and convex-valued, upper hemi-continuous correspondence. Prove that the graph of is a connected set. Is it path-connected? This is what I have so far: Proof We first show that is connected. Assume to the contrary that is not connected. Then where and , , and . Since is compact- and convex-valued, us a closed interval or a singleton for all . Since is upper hemi-continuous, is closed. Let be a limit point of . Without loss of generality, assume , where . Then . Take a sequence such that . Then there exists a subsequence such that , , and . However, no subsequence of can converge to , for otherwise would be in . This contradicts the sequential characterization of upper hemi-continuous correspondence. Therefore, is connected. I would really appreciate it if someone could check if my proof of the connectedness is correct. In addition, I have difficulties to determine whether is path-connected or not. I tried to use the = Deleted Comb Space as a counterexample, but it turns out that is not closed, because its closure is the Comb Space. By the closed-graph theorem, if is upper hemi-continuous, would be closed. Hence is not upper hemi-continuous, a contradiction. This is a question about set-valued analysis and topological spaces . I would like to provide some related definitions and results first, because they are usually not covered in a standard math course in analysis or topology: Definition Let and be two sets. If with each element of we associate a subset of , we say that the correspondence is a mapping of into ; the set is called the image of under the mapping . Definition Let be a mapping of a topological space into a topological space , and let be any point of . We say that is lower hemi-continuous at if for each open set meeting , there is a neighborhood such that We say that is upper hemi-continuous at if for each open set containing there exists a neighborhood such that We say that the mapping is continuous at if it is both lower and upper hemi-continuous at . Definition We say that is lower hemi-continuous in (l.h.c. in ) if it is lower hemi-continuous at each point of . We say that is upper hemi-continuous in (u.h.c. in ) if it is upper hemi-continuous at each point of and if, also, is a compact set for each . If is both lower hemi-continuous in and upper hemi-continuous in , then it will be called continuous in . Definition The correspondence is closed-valued if for each , is closed in . Definition The correspondence is compact-valued if for each , is compact in . Definition The correspondence is convex-valued if for each , is a convex set in . Definition The graph of the correspondence is the set .
