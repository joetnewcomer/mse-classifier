1,What is the Lebesgue measure of zero-dimensional space?,What is the Lebesgue measure of zero-dimensional space?,,"I learnt about the concept of the Lebesgue measure some time ago, and one question was always confusing to me (and was never answered). What is the Lebesgue measure of zero-dimensional space? What I know is that the Lebesgue measure is defined as the standard way of measuring a subset of some Euclidean space $R^n$ , where $n$ is the dimension of the space. This means that: The standard way to measure the subset (a “part” that is well-defined in the space) of a line ( $R^1$ ) is length; makes sense The standard way to measure the subset of a plane ( $R^2$ ) is area; makes sense The standard way to measure the subset of a solid space ( $R^3$ ) is volume; makes sense And this continues for dimensions $d > 3$ in some $R^d$ . But when It comes to $R^0$ , there are two questions that often come unanswered and can really confuse you: Q1 If Lebesgue measure is defined on $n$ -dimensional space as a standard way to assign measure to a proper subset of $R^n$ , how would we define the Lebesgue measure of $0$ -dimensional space? This amounts to measuring the subset of a point, which kind of doesn’t make sense in my mind. Q2 I think we define the dimension of some $S^n$ , where $S$ can be some space, as the number of coordinates (also: coordinate axis) needed to specify the location of some point in/on $S_n$ . This makes sense for $1$ -dimensional space, as you just need one number on the number line to find a location of a point on the number line, and for $2$ -dimensional space, you need two: the $x$ and $y$ -axis to specify a point on a plane. Their logic continues for higher dimensions. But how does it make sense that we need “no coordinates” to specify a point on a point? Or is all of this above stuff nonsense and a point is just zero length? If that’s a case, why would we assign a new dimension to something that can be measured in a Lebesgue measure defined in another dimension? I couldn’t find any useful information anywhere else for these questions, hence Any help or clarification is appreciated!","I learnt about the concept of the Lebesgue measure some time ago, and one question was always confusing to me (and was never answered).

6,How do you construct an everywhere inward/outward-pointing vector field?,How do you construct an everywhere inward/outward-pointing vector field?,,"I've been recently doing some problems in John Lee's book Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (Second Edition) , and I wanted to ask how one would approach the following problem. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with boundary. Show that there exists a global smooth vector field on $M$ whose restriction to $\partial M$ is everywhere inward-pointing, and one whose restriction to $\partial M$ is everywhere outward-pointing. After doing some digging in the book, I found the definition (see Page 118) that Lee is referring to when he says ""inward/outward-pointing"", but it's not necessarily for vector fields. Definition : If $p\in M$ , a vector $v\in T_pM\backslash T_p\partial M$ is said to be inward pointing if for some $\epsilon>0$ there exists a smooth curve $\gamma:[0,\epsilon)\to M$ such that $\gamma(0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=v$ , and it is outward pointing if there exists such a curve whose domain is $(-\epsilon,0]$ . My first question is how to adapt this to a vector field, and make sure that it is inward/outward-pointing everywhere. Here is my proposed definition (as far as I'm aware, it's not in the book). Definition (Own) : Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with boundary, and let $X$ be a smooth vector field on $M$ . Furthermore, let $A\subseteq \partial M$ be a closed subset. Then $X$ is said to be inward-pointing everywhere on $A$ if each $X_p\in T_pM$ is inward-pointing for all $p\in A$ . We say that $X$ is outward-pointing everywhere on $A$ if $X_p\in T_pM$ is outward-pointing for all $p\in A$ . I assume that an outward/inward-pointing vector field is defined similarly. So now that all of the above groundwork has been laid out, here is my ultimate question. Question(s) : Is the above definition the correct interpretation of the problem? If so, I was thinking of just applying Lemma 8.6, or trying to use Proposition 8.7 to prove the claim, but I was unsure if this was the correct approach. For those who don't have the book, these say the following. (Lemma 8.6). Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary, and let $A\subseteq M$ be a closed subset. Suppose that $X$ is a smooth vector field along $A$ (meaning $X_p\in T_pM$ for each $p\in A$ ). Given any open subset $U$ containing $A$ , there exists a smooth vector global vector field $\widetilde{X}$ on $M$ such that $\widetilde{X}|_A=X$ and $\text{supp}~\widetilde{X}\subseteq U$ . (Proposition 8.7). Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with or without boundary. Given $p\in M$ and $v\in T_pM$ , there is a smooth global vector field $X$ on $M$ such that $X_p=v$ .

More precisely, we keep the left circle as it was and we transform the right circle still making an angle $\theta$ with the first one into a vertical line in $C$ , (""circle with an infinite radius""). Fig. 2. In this way $\angle CEI = \theta$ (mutually orthogonal sides) ; therefore angle $\angle CAI = \theta/2$ (inscribed angle theorem). As a consequence $$AH=\tfrac12 \cos \tfrac{\theta}{2} \implies AI=\cos \tfrac{\theta}{2}$$ Then $$AC=\left(\cos \tfrac{\theta}{2}\right)^2$$ The cross ratio is $$\frac{\overline{CA}}{\overline{CB}}\frac{\overline{DA}}{\overline{DB}} = \frac{-\left(\cos \tfrac{\theta}{2}\right)^2}{1-\left(\cos \tfrac{\theta}{2}\right)^2} \times \frac11$$ $$=-\frac{1}{\left(\tan \tfrac{\theta}{2}\right)^2} $$ Proof 2 : Let lower case letters $a,b,c,d$ be used for the abscissas  of $A,B,C,D$ resp. The angle between two intersecting circles is given by the formula : $$\cos \theta = \frac{d^2-(r_1^2+r_2^2)}{2 r_1 r_2}\tag{2}$$ where $r_1,r_2$ are the circles' radii and $d$ the distance between the two centers by an immediate application of the law of cosines to triangle $C_1IC_2$ where $I$ is the intersection point of the two half-circles. With the notations of the figure, (2) can be given the form : $$\cos \theta = \frac{\left(\tfrac12(b+d)-\tfrac12(a+c)\right)^2-\left(\tfrac12(a-c)\right)^2-\left(\tfrac12(b-d)\right)^2}{2\tfrac12(a-c)\tfrac12(b-d)}$$ Different simplifications yield : $$\cos \theta = \frac{(a-b)(c-d)+(b-c)(c-a)}{(a-c)(b-d)}$$ $$\cos \theta = \underbrace{[A,D;B,C]}_{\frac{r}{r-1}}-\underbrace{[B,A;C,D]}_{\frac{1}{1-r}}$$ (where $r$ denotes cross-ratio $[A,C;B,D]$ ). Therefore, we have : $$\cos \theta = \frac{r}{r-1}-\frac{1}{1-r}= \frac{r+1}{r-1}= \frac{1+\tfrac{1}{r}}{1-\tfrac{1}{r}}.$$ From there, one can deduce formula (1) as a consequence of the following classical formula (see here ) : $$\cos \theta = \frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} \ \text{where} \ t=\tan(\tfrac{\theta}{2}).$$","It is well known that : (definition of cross-ratio here ).

As a quick overview: ""The honeycomb conjecture states that a regular hexagonal grid or honeycomb is the best way to divide a surface into regions of equal area with the least total perimeter."" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_conjecture ) ""The Kepler conjecture, named after the 17th-century mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler, is a mathematical theorem about sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space.

The density of these arrangements is around 74.05%."" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture ) Reading this, I had the following questions: 1) The Honeycomb Conjecture says that a hexagonal grid is the best way to divide regions into equal area and the least perimeter, whereas the Sphere Packing Conjecture says that closest packing arrangements can be achieved EITHER using Cubic Arrangements OR Hexagonal Arrangements. Do the results from both these conjectures contradict each other - or are both these conjectures addressing fundamentally different problems? 2) From the Wikipedia Page on the Honeycomb Conjecture, (apparently) the official mathematical formulation of the Honeycomb Conjecture can be written as follows: Why do we want the supremum of the limit of ""r"" to approach infinity? Why are we interested in the perimeter and area of the ""bounded components and the disk of radius r"" - does this represent a choice of tiling arrangement? Would the disk B(0,r) represent a choice of tiling like a hexagon? The fourth root of 12 is 1.86 : why is 1.86 relevant here? 3) Finally, for both the Honeybee Conjecture and the Sphere Packing Conjecture - are we able to ""bound"" the sample space of the solution (i.e. how many possible arrangements can exist)? For instance, suppose we want to predict the the possible outcomes that can arise from flipping a two-sided coin twice - the sample space corresponding to this problem would include 4 outcomes : (Head, Head), (Head, Tail), (Tail, Head), (Tail, Tail) If we were to consider the Sphere Packing Conjecture, we know that the sample space to this problem contains at least 3 possible arrangements: Cubic, Hexagonal and Random. But do there exist more possible arrangements? Are the number of total possible arrangements finite? If we were to consider the Honeybee Conjecture, the following video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edkFs8Vu1E @ 4:03 ) shows us that there the sample space of this problem contains at least 5 possible arrangements: But do there exist more possible arrangements? Are the number of total possible arrangements finite? I found this Wikipedia Page ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_tiling ) that contains (beautiful) pictures about different ways to ""partition and pack"" space: Reading the Wikipedia page, the Euclidean Plane seems to have 3 types of uniform tiling arrangements : Square, Hexagonal and Triangular. But  reading the ""Uniform Tilings Using Star Polygons"" section - it seems like you can have plenty of other types of uniform tiling arrangements (e.g. Topological 3.12.12 , Topological 4.4.4.4, , Topological 6.6.6, etc.). "" The complete lists of k-uniform tilings have been enumerated up to k=6.

( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture ) Reading this, I had the following questions: 1) The Honeycomb Conjecture says that a hexagonal grid is the best way to divide regions into equal area and the least perimeter, whereas the Sphere Packing Conjecture says that closest packing arrangements can be achieved EITHER using Cubic Arrangements OR Hexagonal Arrangements. Do the results from both these conjectures contradict each other - or are both these conjectures addressing fundamentally different problems? 2) From the Wikipedia Page on the Honeycomb Conjecture, (apparently) the official mathematical formulation of the Honeycomb Conjecture can be written as follows: Why do we want the supremum of the limit of ""r"" to approach infinity? Why are we interested in the perimeter and area of the ""bounded components and the disk of radius r"" - does this represent a choice of tiling arrangement? Would the disk B(0,r) represent a choice of tiling like a hexagon? The fourth root of 12 is 1.86 : why is 1.86 relevant here? 3) Finally, for both the Honeybee Conjecture and the Sphere Packing Conjecture - are we able to ""bound"" the sample space of the solution (i.e. how many possible arrangements can exist)? For instance, suppose we want to predict the the possible outcomes that can arise from flipping a two-sided coin twice - the sample space corresponding to this problem would include 4 outcomes : (Head, Head), (Head, Tail), (Tail, Head), (Tail, Tail) If we were to consider the Sphere Packing Conjecture, we know that the sample space to this problem contains at least 3 possible arrangements: Cubic, Hexagonal and Random. But do there exist more possible arrangements? Are the number of total possible arrangements finite? If we were to consider the Honeybee Conjecture, the following video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7edkFs8Vu1E @ 4:03 ) shows us that there the sample space of this problem contains at least 5 possible arrangements: But do there exist more possible arrangements? Are the number of total possible arrangements finite? I found this Wikipedia Page ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_tiling ) that contains (beautiful) pictures about different ways to ""partition and pack"" space: Reading the Wikipedia page, the Euclidean Plane seems to have 3 types of uniform tiling arrangements : Square, Hexagonal and Triangular. But  reading the ""Uniform Tilings Using Star Polygons"" section - it seems like you can have plenty of other types of uniform tiling arrangements (e.g. Topological 3.12.12 , Topological 4.4.4.4, , Topological 6.6.6, etc.). "" The complete lists of k-uniform tilings have been enumerated up to k=6. There are 20 2-uniform tilings, 61 3-uniform tilings, 151 4-uniform tilings, 332 5-uniform tilings, and 673 6-uniform tilings."" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_k-uniform_tilings ) - Is it possible there could existing more tiling arrangements for k>6? Do there exist finite or infinite Non-Uniform Tiling Arrangements? ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Non-uniform_tilings_by_regular_polygons ) But to understand these (beautiful) pictures goes far beyond my knowledge, and I am still not sure if the sample space of the Honeycomb Conjecture contains finite or infinite packing arrangements.

How do actually negative inversion map the points?","\angleAML \angle ABL=\angle AKL H, J BC, AC D, E, F C, A, B I \odot(ABC) O P P' OP\timesOP'=r^2","['geometry', 'contest-math', 'recreational-mathematics', 'problem-solving']"

Without loss of generality, assume that the unit circle is the graph $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ . This means that $b^2 = 1 - a^2, d^2 = 1 - c^2,$ and $y^2 = 1 - x^2$ .
