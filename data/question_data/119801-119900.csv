It is constructed as a chamfer (geometry) (edge-truncation) of a regular dodecahedron. The pentagons are reduced in size and new hexagonal faces are added in place of all the original edges ."" And according to this question , the steps to create a chamfered polyhedron are as follows: shrink the given polyhedron's faces by a factor $r, 0<r<1$ translate the shrunken faces outward [I'll call this distance $s$ ], so that their edges are coplanar with the original polyhedron's edges construct the required hexagons from the original polyhedron's vertices and the vertices of the shrunk faces. I haven't found any other explicit details regarding the relationship between $r$ and the shape of the hexagons, and so my questions are these (note that the value of $s$ will be directly dependent on the shape of the original face, and so $s$ will need to be represented with some parameter(s) that represent the face's shape somehow): What is the general relationship between $r$ and $s$ in order to get coplanar vertices?

However, most examples rely on subtle concepts of probability (e.g., Monty Hall, birthday paradox) or infinity (e.g., Gabriel's Horn, Banach-Tarski).

It should surprise anyone with a basic sense of scale, and yet it is easily explainable to someone with a middle-school understanding of geometry. Moreover, there's not much room for argument (""how do you define probability?"", or ""what is infinity, anyway?""). Back in Ancient Greece, Zeus commissions a blacksmith to forge him a ring that will go around the Earth.

How large is the gap left at the North pole, and what sort of animal can go through? The counterintuitiveness comes from the fact that an error of one meter in circumference is negligible compared with the Earth's circumference. In fact, you might say the blacksmith did a great job in keeping the relative error so small. If you think like me, your intuition will say that the gap must also be negligible. However, the gap is actually around 32 cm: enough for a human to crawl through!

How can I find the minimum radius of curvature of the center line of this pipe such that when the line intersects the wall it will not have an angle greater than 69 degrees? I have tried making a triangle that connects the point where the curve starts, the impact point, and the center of the curve, but that only tells me the angles of that triangle, leaving the sides all unknown. I have found that the length of the outer arc within the triangle has a length of 1.2 times the radius, but again, that isn't helpful. I have no other ideas about how I would even proceed with this and searching online for something I can extrapolate the answer from has been fruitless. The goal is to then find the radius of the circle that is created by curving at that rate. Added explanation from comments: The problem can essentially be boiled down to: Two lines are travelling parallel to each other 1.5 mm apart along the x-plane. At some arbitrary point, the line below curves up and intersects the line above it, creating an angle of 69 degrees from the tangent of the curving line. If the line continues curving at the same speed to create a circle, what is the radius of that circle (i.e. the radius of curvature).","I am given a pipe with a 3mm diameter with walls of nearly infinite thinness (so the impact is not affected the the thickness of the pipe) that has something travelling down the center of it in a line.

At the moment, I am just multiplying the vectors from the input and output set by their weights and summing them, component-wise. While this works well when the angles are small, the filter response isn't right as the angles get larger than 30 degrees. It needs to perfectly compliment the response of a high pass filtered gyroscope, which works with angles, not vectors. What I'm essentially looking for is an interpolation method for multiple (in my case 8) weighted points on a sphere. The sum of all weights is one. The algorithm needs to be such, that if it were applied to only two vectors $a$ and $b$, with the weights $(1 - t)$ and $(t)$ respectively, a constant rate of change in t would result in a constant angular rate of change in the output. Say, for example we had as our two vectors $a = (1, 0, 0)$ and $b = (0, 1, 0)$, the angle ab is 90 degrees. If we set $t$ to $1/3$, we should expect the result, $c$, to be 30 degrees away from $a$. If we use the standard vector multiplication rules to calculate $c$ as $a*(1 - t) + b*t$, the angle between $a$ and $c$ is closer to 22 degrees. This error gets worse as the angle $ab$ increases. I know that the slerp algorithm exists for just two points, but I need one that works on any number of points.

Calculate $EC$ . (Answer: $ EC = 4$ ) Would anyone have a solution using geometry? I made the drawing and I find a solution by use of trigonometry $EC =ED = DC$ ???? How to demonstrate? $\therefore \angle DEC = 60^\circ \implies \angle LEC = 30^\circ $ $\dfrac{EC}{\sin(26.5^\circ)} = \dfrac{EL}{\sin(180^\circ - (26.5^\circ + 30^\circ))} \Longrightarrow$ $EC = \displaystyle\frac{\sin(26.5^\circ)(4+2\sqrt{3})}{\sin(123.5^\circ)} \approx{4}$","In a rectangle , a point is marked inside it and a rectangle is constructed congruent to the previous one, and .

97,get dihedral angles of octahedron given all triangles,get dihedral angles of octahedron given all triangles,,"An octahedron (not necessarily regular) consists of 8 triangles. You can see it as two pyramids glued together (for now on I only consider this case). Call the triangles in the upper pyramid $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4 $ (clockwise) and in the lower pyramid $T_5, …, T_8$ (clockwise). The seams are $(T_i, T_{i+1}) (i=1,2,3,5,6,7),  (T_4, T_1), (T_8, T_5)$ and $(T_i, T_{i+4})  (i=1,2,3,4)$ . Assume you now all information about the triangles. Call the angles and length for triangle $T_i$ (starting from the top (for $i = 1,...,4$ ), resp. bottom (for $i = 5,6,7,8$ ) and go clockwise): $(a_i, b_i, c_i)$ for lengths and $(\alpha_i,  \beta_i, \gamma_i)$ for the angles. You know that they form an octahedron, the question is know: How can I find all dihedral angles? I guess you can find equations to which these dihedral angles need to fullfill and that by solving these system of equations I can find the dihedral angles.

I thought of proving this by creating two right triangles with the same hypotenuse length $h$ , one having an acute angle of $\theta$ and another right triangle having one of its acute angle as $\psi$ .

However, I then realize that the 'greater side is opposite the greater angle' should be applied within a triangle. I also think that maybe I shouldn't assume that both right triangles have the same hypotenuse length. How would I modify this proof so that it is correct?
