2,Showing that smoothing operators are compact,Showing that smoothing operators are compact,,"Suppose I have a bounded, linear map $T: H^1(X) \to H^1(X)$ such that $T(H^1(X)) \subset C^\infty(X)$. Is $T$ a compact operator? I'm guessing this depends on whether or not $X$ is (pre)compact, and in the case I am the most interested in, it is ($X$ is an open, bounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$), but I am also curious about the general question. My preliminary thoughts are Arzela-Ascoli: if we take a sequence of functions $f_n \in H^1(X), ||f_n||=1$, then $||Tf_n|| \leq ||T||$ so the sequence is uniformly bounded. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how I should translate the smoothness of $Tf_n$ (and compactness of $X$) into equicontinuity. Or maybe this follows directly from something like Rellich's theorem or another Sobolev embedding result? EDIT: Let us further refine the problem statement, so that $T$ is a bounded, linear map $H^1_0(X) \to H^1_0(X)$ that extends to a continuous map $\mathcal{E}'(X) \to C^\infty(X)$ (assumptions on $X$ to follow, $\mathcal{E}'$ are compactly supported distributions).

But uniform continuity doesn't necessarily hold, as $X$ is only pre-compact. If we replace $X$ by $\overline X$, then obviously a smooth $k$ on $\overline X \times \overline X$ is uniformly continuous, but does the Schwartz kernel theorem still hold in this case (every map $T:\mathcal{E}'(\overline X) \to C^\infty(\overline X)$ corresponds to a unique, smooth integral kernel)?","Suppose I have a bounded, linear map $T: H^1(X) \to H^1(X)$ such that $T(H^1(X)) \subset C^\infty(X)$.

Now, draw a line $\sigma$ such that $\sigma \perp \omega$ and the only point in commom between $\sigma$ and $\omega$ is $b$. Consider the point that $\lambda$ and $\sigma$ have in commom; this point is nicely denoted as $a + b$. (Note that all my work is based here. Any problems, and my proof goes to trash) This definition can be used to see the properties of adding two numbers $a$ and $b$, for all $a, b \in\mathbb{R}$. Using geometric properties may lead us to a rigorous proof (if not, I would like to know the problems of using it). So, I started: $a, b \in\mathbb{N}$: $a+b = \overbrace{\left(1+1+1+\cdots+1\right)}^a + \overbrace{\left(1+1+1+\cdots+1\right)}^b = \overbrace{1+1+1+1+\cdots+1}^{a+b} = \overbrace{\left(1+1+1+\cdots+1\right)}^b + \overbrace{\left(1+1+1+\cdots+1\right)}^a = b + a$ (Implicity, I'm using the fact that $\left(1+1\right)+1 = 1+\left(1+1\right)$, which I do not know how to prove and interpret it as cutting a segment $c$ in two parts -- $a$ and $b$. However, this result can be extended to $\mathbb{Z}$ in the sense that $-a$ $(a > 0)$ is a change; from right to left). $a, b \in\mathbb{R}$: Here, we have basically two cases: $a$ and $b$ are either positive or negative; $a$ and $b$, where one of them is negative. Since in my definition $-b, b>0$ means drawing a point $b$ to the left of the real line, there's no big deal interpretating it; subtracting can be interpreted now. So, it starts: $a + b = c$. However, $c$  can be cut in two parts: $b$ and $a$. Naturally, if $a>c$, then $b<0$ -- many cases can be listed. So, $c = b + a$. But $c = a + b$; it follows that $a + b = b + a$. My questions: Is there any problem in using my definition of adding two numbers $a$ and $b$, which uses many geometric properties? Is there any way to solve it from informality? Is there anything right here? Thanks in advance.","Being interested in the very foundations of mathematics, I'm trying to build a rigorous proof on my own that $a + b = b + a$ for all $\left[a, b\in\mathbb{R}\right] $. Inspired by interesting properties of the complex plane and some researches, I realized that defining multiplication as repeated addition will lead me nowhere (at least, I could not work with it). So, my ideas: Defining addition $a+b$ as a kind of ""walking"" to right $\left(b>0\right)$ or to the left $\left(b<0\right)$ a space $b$ from $a$. Adding a number $b$ to a number $a$ (denoted by $a+b$) involves doing the following operation: Consider the real line $\lambda$ and its origin at $0$.

87,Proofs in Real Analysis are too 'convenient',Proofs in Real Analysis are too 'convenient',,"I'm doing a first course in real analysis and I have studied nearly 10-15 theorems and proofs by now. One thing I've noticed in all of them is that they all seem too 'convenient' and full of assumptions. This, I find very peculiar to real analysis. To understand my point, consider this one for instance: Theorem : Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence of $\mathbb R^+$ such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} |\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}| = l$ . If $0\le l \lt 1$ , $\lim_{n\to\infty } x_n = 0$ . Proof : Consider $\epsilon \gt 0$ such that $l+\epsilon \lt 1$ . There exists $N \in \mathbb N$ such that $||\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}| - l |\lt \epsilon$ for all $n \ge N$ . $l-\epsilon \lt |\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}| \lt l+\epsilon$ (for all $n \ge N$ .) Let $m = l + \epsilon$ . Given that $0 \le l \lt 1$ , we could say that $0 \lt m \lt 1$ . This gives $|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}| \lt m$ for all $n \ge N$ $x_{N+1} \lt mx_N$ $x_{N+2} \lt mx_{N+1}\lt m^2x_N$ So for all $n \ge N+1$ , $x_n \lt mx_{n-1} \lt m^{n-N}x_N$ . We are therefore left with $0 \lt x_n \lt Am^n$ where $A = \frac{x_N}{m^n}$ . As $\lim_{n\to \infty} Am^n = 0$ as $m\lt 1$ ,using the Squeeze Theorem, we are able to prove the theorem. You see, the whole thing is dependent on one assumption that $l+\epsilon \lt 1$ . But this should ideally hold true for any $\epsilon$ . I wouldn't call this proof 'complete'! Here's another such proof of the quotient law for limits: Let $\epsilon, k \gt 0.$ Then $\frac{\epsilon}{k}$ is also an arbitrary positive number. If $\{x_n\}$ and $\{y_n\}$ are two sequences, we need to prove that the limit of the quotient of the terms equals the quotient of the limits of the terms( say $l$ and $m$ ). For a certain $N$ , $|\frac{x_n}{y_n} - \frac{l}{m}| = |\frac{m(x_n-l) + l(m-y_n)}{my_n}| \le |\frac{|m||x_n-l| + |l||m-y_n|}{|m||y_n|}| \lt \frac{\epsilon}{ky_n} + \frac{\epsilon}{ky_n}\frac{|l|}{|m|} = \frac{\epsilon}{k}\frac{|m|+|l|}{|m||y_n|} $ $ lim_{n \to \infty} y_n = m$ so $lim_{n \to \infty} |y_n| = |m| $ . Let $ 0 <H<|m|$ . Then $ |y_n| > H $ for all $n \ge N_0, N_0 \in \mathbb N$ Choose $N' = max\{N_0, N\}$ so that for all $n \ge N',|\frac{x_n}{y_n} - \frac{l}{m}| < \frac{\epsilon}{k}\frac{|l|+|m|}{|m|H}$ Now choose k such that $ \frac{|l|+|m|}{|m|H} < 1$ so that $|\frac{x_n}{y_n} - \frac{l}{m}| < \epsilon$ . Q.E.D. The last part again contains too convenient choices of constants. I think this might mean that unless you are choosing them in such a manner, the theorem won't hold. It's as though we are creating the proof such that the theorem comes true, which I find strange. Hopefully I've made myself clear. I wonder if there exist 'more convincing' and more elegant proofs which do not take into account so many arbitrary constants. Thank you! Edit As suggested in one of the comments, I am inserting a theorem whose proof seems elegant to me-the Squeeze Theorem. Theorem :Given that $\{x_n\}$ , $\{y_n\}$ and $\{z_n\}$ are three sequences where $x_n \le y_n \le z_n $ for all $n \ge N,$ where $N \in \mathbb N$ , and $\lim_{n\to\infty } x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty } z_n = l,$ then $lim_{n\to\infty } y_n = l$ Proof : For a given $\epsilon \gt 0$ , we have natural numbers $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that $|x_n-l| < \epsilon$ for all $n \ge N_1$ and $|z_n-l| < \epsilon$ for all $n \ge N_2$ . Let $N_3 = max\{N_1, N_2\}$ , then for all $n \ge N_3$ , $|x_n-l| < \epsilon$ and $|z_n-l| < \epsilon$ . This means $l-\epsilon < x_n<l+\epsilon$ and $l-\epsilon < z_n<l+\epsilon$ for all $n \ge N_3$ . Let $N_4 = max\{N, N_3\}$ . Then it holds that $l-\epsilon < x_n < y_n < z_n <l+\epsilon$ and therefore $l-\epsilon < y_n<l+\epsilon$ or $|y_n-l| < \epsilon$ . Q.E.D We certainly have considered multiple constants here, but we are not arbitrarily assigning them values/choosing them to satisfy certain equations, like so: ' $l+\epsilon<1$ ' or 'choose k such that $ \frac{|l|+|m|}{|m|H} < 1$ '.","I'm doing a first course in real analysis and I have studied nearly 10-15 theorems and proofs by now.

This is basic definition but is not difference than saying it is Bounded and Closed or Heine Borel Theorem. Now, the definition of Perfect Set is $P$ is a Perfect Set if $P =P'$ where $P'$ is the set of Limit Points of $P$ (WolframAlpha). At other places, I also that a set is Perfect Set if $P$ is closed and accumulation point of $P$. Though, I do not understand this completely, it sounds similar to definition of Compact Sets. I would appreciate any explanation. Further, are there are any non-singleton sets that are Compact but Not Perfect ? How about Perfect but Non Compact Sets ?",,"['real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'analysis', 'compactness']"
