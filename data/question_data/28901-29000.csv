No ties occur, and each team has a $1/2$ probability of winning any game it plays. Find the probability that no team wins/loses all the games. My try: Each team plays all other teams once. So there are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ games.  For each game there are 2 possible outcomes so there's a total of $2^{10}$ possible outcomes. Number of outcomes where $1$ team wins all its games:  Let's say team A wins all its games ($4$ in total).  Then other $6$ games can end in $2$ possible outcomes.  Since anyone team could win all its games, we get $5 \times 2^6 $ as the number of outcomes where $1$ team wins all its games. Similarly by symmetry, we get $5 \times 2^6 $ as the number of outcomes where $1$ team loses all its games. It's also possible for $1$ team to win all its games, and another team to lose all its games. But these will have been included in both totals above (i.e. calculated twice), so we must subtract this amount once from the totals above:  Let's say team A wins all its games and team B loses all it's games (these include $7$ games, $4$ games for team A and $4$ games for team B, but we must remember that teams A and B play each other once, so there are only $7$ games in which team A or team B plays with certain victory or losing respectively). So, since any of the $5$ teams could be the one to win all its games, and any of the $4$ remaining teams could be the one to lose all its games, we get $5 \times 4 \times 2^3 = 20 \times 2^3. $ Probability that at least one team wins/loses all their games is  $\frac{(5 \times 2^6 + 5 \times 2^6 − 20 \times 2^3)}{ 2^{10}}  = \frac{15}{32}. $ Hence, probability that no team wins/loses all their games is $\frac{17}{32}.$ Is this alright?","Five teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once.

So there are $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ games.  For each game there are 2 possible outcomes so there's a total of $2^{10}$ possible outcomes. Number of outcomes where $1$ team wins all its games:  Let's say team A wins all its games ($4$ in total).  Then other $6$ games can end in $2$ possible outcomes.  Since anyone team could win all its games, we get $5 \times 2^6 $ as the number of outcomes where $1$ team wins all its games. Similarly by symmetry, we get $5 \times 2^6 $ as the number of outcomes where $1$ team loses all its games. It's also possible for $1$ team to win all its games, and another team to lose all its games. But these will have been included in both totals above (i.e. calculated twice), so we must subtract this amount once from the totals above:  Let's say team A wins all its games and team B loses all it's games (these include $7$ games, $4$ games for team A and $4$ games for team B, but we must remember that teams A and B play each other once, so there are only $7$ games in which team A or team B plays with certain victory or losing respectively). So, since any of the $5$ teams could be the one to win all its games, and any of the $4$ remaining teams could be the one to lose all its games, we get $5 \times 4 \times 2^3 = 20 \times 2^3. $ Probability that at least one team wins/loses all their games is  $\frac{(5 \times 2^6 + 5 \times 2^6 − 20 \times 2^3)}{ 2^{10}}  = \frac{15}{32}. $ Hence, probability that no team wins/loses all their games is $\frac{17}{32}.$ Is this alright?",,"['probability', 'permutations']"

Now when choosing two natural numbers, what is the probability (in closed form) of choosing two coprime numbers? Notice, the probability of choosing something divisible by $p$ is $$\frac{1}{2^p}+\frac{1}{2^{2p}}+\frac{1}{2^{3p}}+\frac{1}{2^{4p}}+\ldots=\frac{1}{2^p-1}$$ so the probability of choosing two numbers both divisible by $p$ is $$\frac{1}{(2^p-1)^2}$$ Meaning $$P(a,b;p)=1-\frac{1}{(2^p-1)^2}$$ where $P(a, b;p)$ is the probability that either $a$ or $b$ is not divisible by $p$.

A deck of cards is given to a magician John. Then John consecutively takes the cards from the deck, trying to guess suit of the taken card. He looks at the card after the guess for a feedback. The magician wishes to maximize the expected number $E$ of right guesses. For this purpose he devised the following Strategy: at each turn to guess a suit which has a maximal number of card left in the deck. As an easy exercise we can prove that for any sequence of cards in the deck Strategy ensures at least $n$ right guesses, where $n$ is the maximal number of cards with one suit in the deck. But we can consider a more interesting and complicated problem to calculate the expectation $E$ for Strategy (here we are assuming that the deck is so well shuffled such that all sequences of cards have equal probability). By the way, I conjecture that Strategy is the best for maximizing the expectation $E$, that is any other strategy yields not greater value of $E$. Now I wish to evaluate the expectation $E$ for Strategy. For the simplicity we shall consider only a case when there are only two suits ($m\ge 0$ cards of the first suit and $n\ge m$ cards of the second suit).  Then $E(0,n)=n$ for each $n$ and we have the following recurrence $$E(m,n)=\frac{n}{m+n}(E(m,n-1)+1)+ \frac{m}{m+n}E(m-1,n)$$ for each $n\ge m\ge 1$.

It is not hard to show, by direct (if slightly tedious) calculation, that $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = \sigma^2 $$ Whenever I arrive at a very ""simple"" result through a ""tedious"" derivation, as in this case, I get the strong suspicion that there has to be a more direct, and yet entirely rigorous, reasoning to reach it.  Or rather, a way to view the problem that makes the result immediately ""obvious"". 2 In this case, the best I have found goes something like this: the above result follows  from the fact that, first, $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) = n \sigma^2 $$ and, second, if we subtract $\overline{X}$ instead of $\mu$, we have ""lost one degree of freedom"" , and ""therefore"" $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = (n - 1) \sigma^2 $$ I find this hand-wavy argument thoroughly unconvincing.  (I doubt that those who propose it would believe it if they didn't already know the result from a more rigorous derivation.) Is there something better? EDIT: Here's an example of the kind of argument I'm looking for.  It still has too many gaps to be satisfactory, but at least it shows a reasoning that does not require pencil and paper : it could be delivered orally, or with crude ""marks in the sand"" (no algebra), and be readily understood. First we can see that $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) \geq \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) $$ Why?  Because, the value of $c$ that minimizes $\sum (X_i - c)^2$ is $c = \overline{X}$ (a fact for which I could give a similarly hand-wavy, not-entirely-watertight argument, though easy to prove by tedious computation), which means that whenever $\overline{X} \neq \mu$, we would have $\sum (X_i - \mu)^2 > \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2$. Now, what ""drives"" $\overline{X}$ away from $\mu$ (so to speak) is $\sigma^2$.  So we can conclude that the difference $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) \geq 0 $$ should increase monotonically as $\sigma^2$ increases... Fair enough, but why is the difference exactly $\sigma^2$, and not, say, $\sigma^2/n$, or *gasp* $\pi \sigma^2/n$?  Here my hand-waving begins to run out of steam...  It is suggestive that $\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}) = \mu$ and $$\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mathbb{E}(\overline{X}))^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ Therefore it is tempting to surmise that, since, for each $i$, $(X_i - \mu) - (X_i - \overline{X}) = \overline{X} - \mu$, then each term $(X_i - \mu)^2 - (X_i - \overline{X})^2$ would contribute, ""on average"", $\mathbb{E}\left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right) = \sigma^2/n$ to the total difference.  This would require justifying the tantalizingly Pythagorean-looking equality: $$\mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \mu )^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \overline{X})^2 + ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ ...though I readily concede that this is beginning to look as tedious as any algebraic computation. (I note that in this argument I did not use the fact that in this case $\mathrm{Var}(\sum X_i)=\sum\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$, which is surely the way forward.) 1 The typically given condition is to say that the $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed , but, AFAICT, the last condition is stronger than necessary.  For that matter, as Dilip Sarwate pointed out, the independence condition is also stronger than needed.

It is not hard to show, by direct (if slightly tedious) calculation, that $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = \sigma^2 $$ Whenever I arrive at a very ""simple"" result through a ""tedious"" derivation, as in this case, I get the strong suspicion that there has to be a more direct, and yet entirely rigorous, reasoning to reach it.  Or rather, a way to view the problem that makes the result immediately ""obvious"". 2 In this case, the best I have found goes something like this: the above result follows  from the fact that, first, $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) = n \sigma^2 $$ and, second, if we subtract $\overline{X}$ instead of $\mu$, we have ""lost one degree of freedom"" , and ""therefore"" $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = (n - 1) \sigma^2 $$ I find this hand-wavy argument thoroughly unconvincing.  (I doubt that those who propose it would believe it if they didn't already know the result from a more rigorous derivation.) Is there something better? EDIT: Here's an example of the kind of argument I'm looking for.  It still has too many gaps to be satisfactory, but at least it shows a reasoning that does not require pencil and paper : it could be delivered orally, or with crude ""marks in the sand"" (no algebra), and be readily understood. First we can see that $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) \geq \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) $$ Why?  Because, the value of $c$ that minimizes $\sum (X_i - c)^2$ is $c = \overline{X}$ (a fact for which I could give a similarly hand-wavy, not-entirely-watertight argument, though easy to prove by tedious computation), which means that whenever $\overline{X} \neq \mu$, we would have $\sum (X_i - \mu)^2 > \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2$. Now, what ""drives"" $\overline{X}$ away from $\mu$ (so to speak) is $\sigma^2$.  So we can conclude that the difference $$ \textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) \geq 0 $$ should increase monotonically as $\sigma^2$ increases... Fair enough, but why is the difference exactly $\sigma^2$, and not, say, $\sigma^2/n$, or *gasp* $\pi \sigma^2/n$?  Here my hand-waving begins to run out of steam...  It is suggestive that $\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}) = \mu$ and $$\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} = \mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mathbb{E}(\overline{X}))^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ Therefore it is tempting to surmise that, since, for each $i$, $(X_i - \mu) - (X_i - \overline{X}) = \overline{X} - \mu$, then each term $(X_i - \mu)^2 - (X_i - \overline{X})^2$ would contribute, ""on average"", $\mathbb{E}\left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right) = \sigma^2/n$ to the total difference.  This would require justifying the tantalizingly Pythagorean-looking equality: $$\mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \mu )^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \overline{X})^2 + ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ ...though I readily concede that this is beginning to look as tedious as any algebraic computation. (I note that in this argument I did not use the fact that in this case $\mathrm{Var}(\sum X_i)=\sum\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$, which is surely the way forward.) 1 The typically given condition is to say that the $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed , but, AFAICT, the last condition is stronger than necessary.  For that matter, as Dilip Sarwate pointed out, the independence condition is also stronger than needed.  It is sufficient that $\mathrm{Var}(\sum X_i)=\sum\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$. 2 The ""scare quotes"" around ""simple"", ""tedious"", and ""obvious"" aim to convey the concession that these terms are all, of course, in the eye of the beholder.  So ""simplicity"" is shorthand for subjective simplicity or perceived simplicity , etc.  Also in the eye of the beholder is how much (perceived) tedium seems too much relative to the (perceived) simplicity.

Are there numbers $a_{0}$, $b_{0}$, $c_{0}$, $d_{0}$ that minimize $$|a-a_{0}|+|b-b_{0}|+|c-c_{0}|+|d-d_{0}|$$ most of the time? I mean, if we repeat the process of choosing $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ randomly, is there a expected value for $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$? And what it is? I tried to start with an easiest problem, with just $a$ and $b$, such that $0\leq a\leq b\leq 1$ and $a+b=1$ but I had no idea where to start, so I decided to try with some numerical sampling, and I did the next in Python: Choose a number $x\in [0,1]$ uniformely, and define $a=\min\{x,1-x\}$ and $b=\max\{x,1-x\}$. Clearly $0\leq a\leq b\leq 1$ and $a+b=1$. Doing this, and repeating a lot of times I got that the ""expected value"" for $a$ was $0.25$ and for $b$ was $0.75$, so the ratio is $1:3$ . Next, I tried the same in Python but with two values: Choose $x,y\in [0,1]$ uniformely, and let $x_{1}=\min\{x,y\}$ and $x_{2}=\max\{x,y\}$, now define $$A=\{x_{1},x_{2}-x_{1},1-x_{2}\}$$ and let $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $a_{3}$ be the elements of $A$ in increasing order. Clearly $0\leq a_{1}\leq a_{2}\leq a_{3}\leq 1$, and $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=1$, and repeting a lot of times I got that the ""expected values"" were of the ratio $2:5:11$ .

Are there numbers $a_{0}$, $b_{0}$, $c_{0}$, $d_{0}$ that minimize $$|a-a_{0}|+|b-b_{0}|+|c-c_{0}|+|d-d_{0}|$$ most of the time? I mean, if we repeat the process of choosing $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ randomly, is there a expected value for $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$? And what it is? I tried to start with an easiest problem, with just $a$ and $b$, such that $0\leq a\leq b\leq 1$ and $a+b=1$ but I had no idea where to start, so I decided to try with some numerical sampling, and I did the next in Python: Choose a number $x\in [0,1]$ uniformely, and define $a=\min\{x,1-x\}$ and $b=\max\{x,1-x\}$. Clearly $0\leq a\leq b\leq 1$ and $a+b=1$. Doing this, and repeating a lot of times I got that the ""expected value"" for $a$ was $0.25$ and for $b$ was $0.75$, so the ratio is $1:3$ . Next, I tried the same in Python but with two values: Choose $x,y\in [0,1]$ uniformely, and let $x_{1}=\min\{x,y\}$ and $x_{2}=\max\{x,y\}$, now define $$A=\{x_{1},x_{2}-x_{1},1-x_{2}\}$$ and let $a_{1}$, $a_{2}$, $a_{3}$ be the elements of $A$ in increasing order. Clearly $0\leq a_{1}\leq a_{2}\leq a_{3}\leq 1$, and $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=1$, and repeting a lot of times I got that the ""expected values"" were of the ratio $2:5:11$ . Repeating the same method but now with one more variable I got that the ""expected values"" were on ratio $3:7:13:25$ . Lastly, with one more variable the ratios were $12:27:47:77:137$ .

44,A Proof of Correctness of Durstenfeld's Random Permutation Algorithm,A Proof of Correctness of Durstenfeld's Random Permutation Algorithm,,"Question : Does anyone have a precise mathematical proof of Durstenfeld's Algorithm ? The first $O(n)$ shuffle or random permutation generator was published by Richard Durstenfeld in 1964. This algorithm came to the notice of programmers because it was included in Knuth 1969, page 125, 2 , as Algorithm P . A succinct statement of the algorithm is: \begin{equation} \text{for  }\ k \leftarrow n,n-1,\ldots,2\ \text{ do } \begin{cases} \text{Choose at random a number}\ \ r \in [1,k] \\\ \text{Interchange }\pi[r] \text{ and }\pi[k],\\ \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\pi[1 \ldots n]$ is the array to be shuffled or randomly permuted. This is a truly elegant algorithm, computationally and mathematically. Computationally it handles set operations by dividing the array $\pi$ into an unshuffled set $\pi[1,\ldots, k]$, and a shuffled set $\pi[k+1,\ldots, n]$. At each iteration $k$, it chooses a random element $\pi[r]$ from the unshuffled set  $\pi[1,\ldots, k]$, and interchanges it with $\pi[k]$. This moves $\pi[r]$ into the new shuffled set $\pi[k,\ldots, n]$, where it remains, unmoved, for all subsequent iterations. This is done in $O(1)$ time and space. Thus, the time and space complexity of Durstenfeld's algorithm is $O(n)$, which is optimal. Mathematically, the algorithm is elegant because it implicitly uses the well-known lemma that every permutation $\pi$ is a product of transpositions. At each iteration $k$, the algorithm chooses a random number $r_k \in [1,\ldots,k]$ and performs a transposition $(\pi[k], \pi[r_k])$. Thus the random permutation produced can be written as $$ \pi = (\pi[n],\pi[r_n])(\pi[n-1],\pi[r_{n-1}]) \cdots (\pi[k],\pi[r_k])\cdots (\pi[2],\pi[r_2]), $$ where $(\pi[k],\pi[r_k])$ is the transposition or interchange of $\pi[k]$ and $\pi[r_k]$.

What I have so far \begin{eqnarray} P\left(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}} I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}\geq b_m\right) &=& 1- P\left( \sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}} I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}< b_m \right)\\ &\geq& 1-P\left( \sup_{i\in\mathcal{M}} I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}< b_m/\text{Card}(\mathcal{M}) \right)\\ &\geq&  1- \sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}} P\left(I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}< b_m/\text{Card}(\mathcal{M}) \right)\\ &\geq&  1- \sum_{i\in\mathcal{M}} [1-P\left(I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}\geq b_m/\sqrt{n} \right)]\\ \end{eqnarray} Now it suffices to show that $P\left(I\{|T_i|> c\sqrt{\log m} \}\geq b_m/\sqrt{n}\right)\to 1$, which I'm having trouble showing.",,"['probability', 'probability-theory', 'statistics']"

65,The theory in probability,The theory in probability,,"Consider a real-life experiment (perhaps written as a problem in a textbook): A coin is continually tossed until two consecutive heads are observed. Assume that the results of the tosses are mutually independent and the coin is fair. What is the expected number of tosses before the experiment ends? Now, how would one solve this problem? First, we would need to define a probability space to model the experiment. The issue is that there are so many possibilities: We could define the sample space to be an uncountable set of all infinite-length strings of $H$ and $T$. This sample space already does not seem to fulfill the experiment's condition: that it terminates once two consecutive heads are observed. E.g. $HHTTTTT...$ and $HHHHHHH...$ are different outcomes in the sample space but are actually considered the same in the experiment (since we terminate after two heads). So to say that a sample space consists of all possible distinct outcomes of an experiment seem wrong to me. And yet, according to many sources, this is a natural space to use. Also, there can be infinitely many $\sigma$-algebras so there's the question of which one to use too. Lastly for the probability measure we can use the assumption that the coin is fair and the results of the tosses are independent so $P(\text{outcome starts with }TH) = P(\text{first toss is }T)P(\text{second toss is }H) = 0.25$, for example. We could take outcomes of the experiment to be the entire string of heads and tails from the start until termination of the experiment. So our sample space has all finite-length strings of $T$ and $H$ ending with $HH$, as well as infinite length strings that do not contain $HH$ as a substring. This space is uncountable, so again there are infinitely many $\sigma$-algebras. Now how do we define a probability measure? We should have $P(\text{outcome starts with }HHH) = P(\text{first toss is }H)P(\text{second toss is }H)P(\text{third toss is }H) = 0.125$ since the coins are fair and independent, but there are no outcomes starting with $HHH$ in this sample space, so this probability should actually be $0$. So my guess is that, instead we assume that $P(\text{$k$-th toss is heads | outcome starts with $s$}) = 0.5$, where $s$ is any $(k-1)$-length string containing no $HH$. Now this is stated nowhere in the given problem, and yet is very intuitive in the conventional sense of ""independence"" in the real world. Is this correct? We could only take the finite-length strings of $T$ and $H$ that end with $HH$, and ignore the infinite length strings. Now the question is: how do we know this is indeed the set of all outcomes? How do we know this is a valid assumption? Of course this simplifies a lot of things since the space is now discrete. We could even take the last 4 (or less) coin flips of finite runs as well as infinite runs as the sample space, so $$\Omega = \{HH, THH, \text{ends with }TTHH, \text{ends with }HTHH\}\cup \{s : s\text{ is an infinite string of $H$ and $T$}\}.$$ Now independence is defined only in the context of a probability space. So in this space we have $$\begin{eqnarray*}P(HH) &=& P(\text{last toss is }H \cap \text{2nd last toss is }H) \\&=& P(\text{last toss is }H)P(\text{2nd last toss is }H) \\&=& 0.25\\ P(THH) &=& 0.125\\ P(\text{ends with }TTHH) = P(\text{ends with }HTHH) &=& 0.0625.\end{eqnarray*}$$ So $P(\text{infinite string of $H$ and $T$}) = 1 - 0.25 - 0.125 - 0.0625 - 0.0625 = 0.5$. But clearly this does not conform to the above 3 models. So can we use this as a probability space? What is the issue here? Intuitively I can see how the probability spaces 1 to 3 all compute the same expectation. There are also countless other spaces that do too. The question is, is it possible to rigorize all this? It seems that each space above has some problems with it that raises the question of whether it is appropriate. Am I right to say that this portion relies completely on intuition and cannot possibly be rigorized? That is, the theory and mathematical rigor only starts after we have defined the probability space. Of course, then the question comes: how do we know our probability space ""works"" aside from intuition? Can we know that two different probability spaces will give us the same answer to a question? Also, am I right that there are actually way more assumptions in probability aside from the probability space? For instance: Independence in mathematical context is just $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ but in real life we say that this means occurrence of $A$ does not affect probability of $B$ -- is this an assumption? $P(A | B) = P(A \cap B)/P(B)$ but in real life, we say $P(A | B)$ is the chance that $A$ occurs, given that $B$ has happened -- is this an assumption? The expected value of random variable $X$ is just defined as $E(X) = \sum_{\omega\in\Omega}P(\omega)X(\omega)$ in discrete spaces but in real life, we say it is the mean of $X$ if the experiment is repeated many many times -- is this an assumption? So all in all, there seems to be many assumptions in probability. So when does the theory start and end? EDIT: I've read a bit more about this issue and found that the reason why probability spaces give the same answer is likely due to them being extensions of each other. Terence Tao wrote about this once and if I'm not mistaken, the extension he talks about essentially shows the equivalence of the first 3 probability spaces I mentioned. Is this correct? According to this, independence should then be preserved under extension, so it doesn't make sense that independence ($P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$) doesn't work under probability space 2 but works under 1. What I'm thinking might be the resolution is that when we state that ""the results of some coin tosses are mutually independent"", we are assuming that every single one of these independent coin tosses are performed in every single outcome . So in probability space 2, even though an outcome string might be of finite length, we assume that the other infinitely many coin tosses have also been performed (although their results are irrelevant for this outcome). Is this way of thinking correct? But now it seems strange that $P(\text{the $100$-th coin is heads}) = 0.5$, since after all the $100$-th coin is only tossed in the event that the $99$ coins before it do not contain consecutive heads. What is wrong here?","Consider a real-life experiment (perhaps written as a problem in a textbook): A coin is continually tossed until two consecutive heads are observed.

Terence Tao wrote about this once and if I'm not mistaken, the extension he talks about essentially shows the equivalence of the first 3 probability spaces I mentioned. Is this correct? According to this, independence should then be preserved under extension, so it doesn't make sense that independence ($P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$) doesn't work under probability space 2 but works under 1. What I'm thinking might be the resolution is that when we state that ""the results of some coin tosses are mutually independent"", we are assuming that every single one of these independent coin tosses are performed in every single outcome . So in probability space 2, even though an outcome string might be of finite length, we assume that the other infinitely many coin tosses have also been performed (although their results are irrelevant for this outcome). Is this way of thinking correct? But now it seems strange that $P(\text{the $100$-th coin is heads}) = 0.5$, since after all the $100$-th coin is only tossed in the event that the $99$ coins before it do not contain consecutive heads.

68,Voronoi cell volume inside the ball,Voronoi cell volume inside the ball,,"I have the following problem: Let us denote a ball with center $C$ and radius $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as $B(C, R)$ . Given a unit ball $B(0, 1)$ and vector $u$ has a uniform distribution inside the ball: $u \sim U(B(0, 1))$ . Then we sample $M$ points $v_1, \dots, v_M$ that are uniformly distributed in the ball $B(0, 1)$ and the distance between $u$ and $v_i$ is not greater than $r$ , that is $v_i$ are i.i.d. in $B(0, 1) \cap B(u, r)$ . How to estimate the volume of the Voronoi cell of $u$ inside the ball $B(0, 1)$ ? I need an upper bound here. I can obtain only very rough estimates which do not depend on the dimension of the space $d$ and radius $r$ . It is clear that the desired values are growing monotonically as $r$ growing and if we put $r \ge 2$ , then $v_1, \dots, v_M$ are uniformly distributed inside the ball $B(0, 1)$ . So, $u, v_1, \dots, v_M$ are i.i.d. and uniformly distributed in $B(0, 1)$ . The rigorous definition of the value that I need to estimate (up to a scaling factor of the volume of unit ball): $$ \mathbb{E}_{u, v_1, \dots, v_M} (\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~u | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}) $$ It is clear that $\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~u | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}$ = $\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~v_i | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}$ , so the expectations of all volumes are equal and the sum of all volumes is equal to $1$ . Hence $$ \mathbb{E}_{u, v_1, \dots, v_M} (\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~u | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}) = \frac{1}{M+1}$$ It remains only to multiply it by the volume of unit ball. But as $r$ becomes less than $2$ the volume decreases, so would like to obtain estimates which take it into account. Moreover, I performed numerical experiments which shows that the estimation also should depends on the dimension of the space $d$ . Here is normal and log scale plots ( $M = 10$ ): In the more general case when $r < 2$ we still have that $\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~v_j | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}$ = $\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~v_k | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}$ and the sum of such probabilities for $u$ and $v_1, \dots, v_M$ is equal to $1$ , so we have: $$ \mathbb{E}_{u, v_1, \dots, v_M} (\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~u | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}) + M \mathbb{E}_{u, v_1, \dots, v_M} (\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~v_1 | q \sim U(B(0,1))\}) = 1$$ If we were able to find another equation or estimation on the ratio of volumes, then the problem would be solved. I would very appreciate any your help, ideas, papers, books and so on. Thank you for your help! UPD: Also it is possible to directly write down the required value as an integral. It is easy to see that the probability $\mathbb{P}(\rho(q, u) < \rho(q, v_i))$ correspond to the volume of spherical cap , it only remains to find the height of this spherical cap. My calculations showed that if $\|u\| \le \|v\|$ then $$ h = 1 - \dfrac{\|v\|^2 - \|u\|^2}{2\|v-u\|} $$ $$ \mathbb{P} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} I_{2h - h^2}(\frac{d+1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) $$ and if $\|u\| \ge \|v\|$ then $$ h = 1 - \dfrac{\|u\|^2 - \|v\|^2}{2\|v-u\|} $$ $$ \mathbb{P} = \frac{1}{2} I_{2h - h^2}(\frac{d+1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) $$ where $I_x(a, b)$ is incomplete regularized beta function . One more observation is: $$\mathbb{P}\{ q~\text{belongs to the Voronoi cell of}~u\} = \mathbb{P}(\rho(q, u) < \rho(q, v_i), i=1,\dots,M) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{M}\mathbb{P}(\rho(q, u) < \rho(q, v_i)) = (\mathbb{P}(\rho(q, u) < \rho(q, v)))^M$$ since $v_1,\dots,v_M$ are i.i.d. So now we can integrate for $u$ and $v$ and obtain the desired value: $$ \frac{1}{Vol(B(0,1))} \int\limits_{u \in B(0,1)} \Big( \int\limits_{v \in B(0,1) \cap B(u, r), \|v\| \le \|u\|} (\frac{1}{2}I_{2h-h^2}(\frac{d+1}{2},\frac{1}{2}))^M \frac{1}{Vol(B(0,1) \cap B(u,r))}dv + \int\limits_{v \in B(0,1) \cap B(u, r), \|v\| \ge \|u\|} (1 - \frac{1}{2}I_{2h-h^2}(\frac{d+1}{2},\frac{1}{2}))^M \frac{1}{Vol(B(0,1) \cap B(u,r))}dv \Big) du,$$ where $h = 1 - \frac{| \|v\|^2 - \|u\|^2 |}{2\|v-u\|}$ The first summand here is about $\frac{1}{2^M}$ since regularized incomplete beta function is bounded by $1$ , so it remains only to estimate the second summand.

76,How do we understand 6 people trying something is not 6 times the success rate? [duplicate],How do we understand 6 people trying something is not 6 times the success rate? [duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : What's 4 times more likely than 80%? (6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Let's say if a task has a success rate of $20\%$, or $0.2$, meaning if a person tries it, then there is a $20\%$ chance he can succeed. One example is, if we generate a random number from 1 to 10, and getting the number 9 or 10 is considered to be a success. Now, if we let 6 people try it, and one person succeeding is considered a success, we cannot say the success rate is $6$ times as much, because then the success rate is $20\% \times 6 = 120\%$, and probability cannot be greater than $100\%$.  So the success rate is not 6 times as much. However, if we let 1 person try it $1,000,000$ times, the Law of Large Numbers says that the number of times he will succeed is $200,000$. And if we let 6 people try $1,000,000$ times each, then the number of success is indeed $200,000 \times 6 = 1,200,000$ which is $6$ times.  How can we understand this? In a real life example, say, each time when we catch a Pokemon, let's say there is a special type of Pokemon that when you tap on it, it can be ""shiny"", and the probability is $1/256$.  Now if one player try to tap on $300$ Pokemon, the probability of getting at least one shiny is not $1$, but less than $1$.  If we let 6 people, each try to tap on $300$ Pokemon (and a Pokemon can be non-shiny for player 1 but is shiny for player 2, meaning it is independent), then the probability of getting at least one shiny is not $6$ times. Now, however, if we let all 6 players, each tap on $3,000,000$ Pokemon, then the number of shiny Pokemon they will get is in fact $6$ times  if we only allow 1 player to play.

99,Probability of rolling a double $6$ with two dice,Probability of rolling a double  with two dice,6,"Two dice (with numbers 1 to 6 on the faces) are rolled. One die rolls a 6. What is the probability of rolling a double 6? One solution is to say that P(2 sixes) = $\frac{1}{6}$ since the first die gives a 6, so the only way to get a double six is by rolling a six on the other die (which has a 1 in 6 chance). Another solution is to say that there are 11 possible combinations if one die rolls a six i.e. (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2) and (6, 1). So the probability of rolling a double six if one six has already been rolled is $\frac{1}{11}$. Which answer is correct and why?","Two dice (with numbers 1 to 6 on the faces) are rolled.
