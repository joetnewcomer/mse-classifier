7,is a net stronger than a transfinite sequence for characterizing topology?,is a net stronger than a transfinite sequence for characterizing topology?,,"For metric spaces, knowledge of the convergence of sequences determines the topology completely. A set is closed in the metric topology if and only if it is closed under the limit of convergent sequences operation. Put another way, a map between metric spaces is continuous if and only if it preserves limits of sequences. For general topological spaces, this result no longer holds. Spaces for which it does hold are called sequential spaces . Spaces are usually not sequential because they are not first countable. In such spaces, there are ""not enough"" numbers in the countable index set to extend into these very large spaces and reach every limit point. For example, if $\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, then $\omega_1+1$ is a topological space under the order topology, and $\omega_1$ is a limit point, but no sequence of ordinals reaches $\omega_1$. The topology of this space is not characterized by limits of sequences. This defect is usually fixed by replacing the notion of a sequence with the more general notion of a net, which is like a sequence but indexed by an arbitrary directed set, instead of the natural numbers. Since the net's index set is arbitrary, it can be of any cardinality and therefore nets can reach those faraway limit points in non first countable spaces, and the result is restored: a function between topological spaces is continuous iff it preserves limits of nets. A set is closed iff it is closed under limit of nets. But if the problem is that the cardinality of the space is too high for sequences to do the job, the most conservative generalization that suggests itself to me is to just increase the cardinality of the index set; the transfinite sequence, indexed by an arbitrary ordinal. So my question is: is this strong enough? Is it just a matter of convenience? Nets require less machinery, and are natural because e.g. the neighborhoods of a point constitute a net, whereas transfinites require a detour into unrelated areas of set theory. But nets are not totally ordered, and there may be times it would be nice to have a totally ordered index set for our sequence-like object.

Since  $$ \left\{ \mathcal{M} \ \frac{x}{e^{2\pi x}-1} \right\}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{s}}{e^{2 \pi x}-1} \, dx = (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) $$ for $\operatorname{Re}(s) >1$, we have $$  \frac{x}{e^{2\pi x}-1}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) x^{-s} \, ds , $$ where $c >1$. Replacing $x$ with $n$ and summing both sides, we get $$ \begin{align} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n}{e^{2\pi n}-1} &= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1)\zeta(s)\, ds \\&= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} f(s) \, ds. \end{align} $$ The integrand has simple poles at $s=-1, 0$, and $1$. The fact that $\left|\Gamma(s)\right|$ decays exponentially fast to $0$ as $\text{Im} (s) \to \pm \infty$ allows us to shift the contour to the left. I originally shifted the contour all the way to negative infinity. But as Marko Riedel explains below , we want to shift the contour to the imaginary axis since the integrand is odd there. Indeed, using the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function, we get $$ f(it) = \frac{it}{2 \pi} \sinh \left(\frac{\pi t }{2} \right) \operatorname{csch}(\pi t) \left|\zeta(1+it)\right|^{2}, \quad t \in \mathbb{R}.$$ Therefore, $$ \int_{c-i \infty}^{c+i \infty} f(s) \, ds = 2 \pi i \ \text{Res}[f,1] + \pi i \ \text{Res}[f,0] ,$$ where $$ \begin{align} \text{Res}[f,0] &= \lim_{s \to 0} s (2 \pi)^{-(s+1)} \Gamma(s+1) \zeta(s+1) \zeta(s) \\ &= \lim_{s\to 0} s\zeta(s+1) (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s) \\ &= 1\left(\frac{1}{2 \pi} \right)(1)\left(- \frac{1}{2} \right) \\ &=-\frac{1}{4 \pi} \end{align} $$ and $$ \begin{align} \text{Res}[f,1] &= \lim_{s \to 1} (s-1) (2 \pi)^{-(s+1)} \Gamma(s+1) \zeta(s+1) \zeta(s) \\ &= \lim_{s\to 1}(s-1)\zeta(s) (2\pi)^{-(s+1)}\Gamma(s+1)\zeta(s+1) \\&= 1\left(\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2}}\right)(1)\left(\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}\right) \\ &=\frac{1}{24} . \end{align} $$ The result then follows.","Inspired by this answer , I'm trying to show that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n}{e^{2 \pi n}-1} = \frac{1}{24} - \frac{1}{8 \pi}$$ using the inverse Mellin transform.

The problem introduces the sequence $a_n$ , defined by $a_0 = 1$ and $$ a_{n}=a_{\left\lfloor n/2\right\rfloor}+a_{\left\lfloor n/3 \right\rfloor}+a_{\left\lfloor n/6\right\rfloor} $$ and asks for a proof that $$ \lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{a_{n}}{n}=\dfrac{12}{\log{432}}. $$ Writing the generating function $\displaystyle A(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} a_n x^n$ , this translates to $$ A(x) = (1 + x)A(x^2) + (1 + x + x^2) A(x^3) + (1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^5)A(x^6) - 2 $$ Even better, let $b_0 = a_0$ and $b_n = a_n - a_{n-1}$ for all $n \ge 1$ , and define the generating function $\displaystyle B(x) = \sum_{n \ge 0} b_n x^n = (1 - x)A(x)$ .  Multiplying the above by $(1-x)$ gives $$ (1 - x)A(x) = (1 - x^2)A(x^2) + (1 - x^3)A(x^3) + (1 - x^6)A(x^6) + 2x - 2 $$ i.e. $$ B(x) = B(x^2) + B(x^3) + B(x^6) + 2x - 2 \tag{1} $$ After unsuccessfully trying to do asymptotics with the above elegant formula, I used it to find an explicit representation of $B$ , using the Delannoy Numbers : $$ B(x) = 1 + 2 \sum_{l, m \ge 0} \sum_{d \ge 0} 2^d {l \choose d}{m \choose d} x^{2^l 3^m} $$ It follows that in fact \begin{align*} b_n&= \begin{cases} 1 &n=0 \\ 2 \sum_{d \ge 0} 2^d \binom{l}{d} \binom{m}{d} &n =2^l3^m \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases} \\[10pt] a_n&=1+2\sum_{d\ge0}2^d\sum_{\begin{matrix}l,m\ge0\\2^l 3^m \le n\end{matrix}}{l \choose d}{m \choose d} \tag{2} \end{align*} One can do naive bounds on the sum in (2) - replacing the condition $2^l 3^m \le n$ with $2^l 2^m \le n$ and $3^l 3^m \le n$ for upper and lower bounds, respectively. But this isn't good enough; it gives (after algebra and combinatorial work) approximately $$ \frac{n^{\log_3(1 + \sqrt{2}) - 1}}{2} < \frac{a_n}{n} < \frac{n^{\log_2(1 + \sqrt{2}) - 1}}{2} $$ This seems to suggest trying to approximate (2) with the condition $(1 + \sqrt{2})^l (1 + \sqrt{2})^m \le n$ , but I have no idea how to justify that. At any rate, I've made too much of what feels like progress to give up on the problem, and if anyone can think of a way to use (2) to get a solution or else to use (1) and find the asymptotics directly, I'd be very thankful.","In attempting to answer this question , I reduced it to a seemingly simple generating functions question, but after days of work was unable to construct a proof.

42,Grasshopper jumping on circles,Grasshopper jumping on circles,,"Can we characterize the grasshopper sequence? Let $n\in\mathbb N$ be the number of stones $s\in\{0,1,2\dots,n-1\}=S$ on a circle that the grasshopper can jump on. Let $v(s)$ be the number of times the grasshopper visited the stone $s$ . Initially, $v(s)=0$ for all $s\in S$ . The grasshopper takes a running start and starts jumping around, not planning to slow down. At the $k$ th jump say he is on some stone $s\in S$ . Say stone $s_L$ is $k$ steps anticlockwise, and stone $s_R$ is $k$ steps clockwise. He will jump on $s_L$ if $v(s_L)\le v(s_R)$ , otherwise he will jump on $s_R$ . That is, if $s$ is the current stone, then he either moves to: $$s\to (s-k)\bmod n$$ $$s\to (s+k)\bmod n$$ Depending which of the two stones was visited least amount of times till this point. Let $a(n)$ be the number of jumps the grasshopper makes before visiting all stones at least once, when jumping on $n$ stones placed on a circle. For example, if $n=5$ , he takes $10$ jumps to visit all stones, so $a(5)=10$ . The jumps are: $$\begin{array}{cccc} k & (v(0), v(1), v(2), v(3), v(4)) & \text{jump} & {s}_{L}/{s}_{R} \\ -  & (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) & \\ 0  & (1, 0, 0, 0, 0) &  s \to 0  & \\  1  & (1, 0, 0, 0, 1) &  0 \to 4  & L\\ 2  & (1, 0, 1, 0, 1) &  4 \to 2  & L\\ 3  & (1, 0, 1, 0, 2) &  2 \to 4  & L\\ 4  & (1, 0, 1, 1, 2) &  4 \to 3  & R\\ 5  & (1, 0, 1, 2, 2) &  3 \to 3  & L\\ 6  & (1, 0, 2, 2, 2) &  3 \to 2  & L\\ 7  & (2, 0, 2, 2, 2) &  2 \to 0  & L\\ 8  & (2, 0, 3, 2, 2) &  0 \to 2  & L\\ 9  & (2, 1, 3, 2, 2) &  2 \to 1  & R\\ \end{array}$$ WLOG grasshopper prefers anticlockwise $s_L$ , and the zeroth jump sets $s=0$ as starting stone. What can we say about $a(n)$ ? One easy pattern I noticed, is that it appears to be: $$a(n)=n \iff n\in\{2^m,m\in\mathbb N\}\cup\{1,3,7\}$$ Otherwise, it appears that $a_n(n)\gg n$ is much greater. Here is the plot of around first $15000$ terms of $a(n)$ : The red line below is $y=x$ and intersects $n=2^m$ 's since $a(2^m)=2^m$ . All the other terms are above the blue line which is $y=x^{1.14}-4$ , an exponential lower bound that I guessed holds so far. The green line intersects the origin $(0,0)$ and the term $a(10496)=108893$ , which is the farthest term from the average so far. We have $10496=2^8\cdot 41$ . $(Q_1)$ Can we prove all terms $a(n)$ will be finite? For fixed $n$ the jumping must be periodic eventually, but will that period contain every $s$ ? Or would this be too hard? - Since this looks like something similar to proving  Recamán's sequence visits all numbers, which is a known unsolved problem. For comparison, if we would always jump anticlockwise and only switch to clockwise if the $v(s_R)=0$ , then the sequence would not terminate for all $n$ (would not be finite for all $n$ ). Can we say anything else about the sequence $a(n)$ ? $(Q_2)$ Can we find closed forms for patterns other than when $n=2^m$ ? I'm not sure how to approach this. Can we determine when the clockwise jumps $R$ occur? Since the grasshopper prefers jumping on $s_L$ , maybe finding when jumps on $s_R$ (the $R$ jumps) occur, can help characterize the sequence. Hence, define $R(r,n):=$ "" $k$ th jump at which the grasshopper preformed the $r$ th $R$ jump."" Recall that if $n=2^m$ , we never preform the $R$ jump as first $n$ $L$ jumps visit all stones. Hence assume $n\ne 2^m$ . We wanted to first find a closed form for when first $R$ jump occurs. The first $R$ jump. That is, we look at $R(1,n)$ values, and it appears that it is $\approx n/l$ , for some $l\in\mathbb N$ . if $n=p$ is prime, then $R(1,p)\approx n/2$ , to be precise: ( $\delta\in\mathbb N$ depends on exact $n$ ) $$R(1,p)=\frac12(n+1)+\delta$$ if $n=2p$ where $p$ prime, then $R(1,2p)\approx n/4$ , to be precise: ( $\delta\in\mathbb N$ depends on exact $n$ ) $$R(1,2p)=\frac14(n+2)+\delta$$ if $n=2^m q$ where $q$ is odd, then $R(1,2^m q)\approx n/q$ . Depending on $l$ value, we get terms $R(1,n)$ accumulating around lines $y=x/l$ . Notice how odd $l$ are rarely populated, and how even $l$ are dense. For example, as already mentioned, primes gather around $l=2$ , and even semiprimes around $l=4$ . For an odd $l$ example, it seems the numbers of form $2^m\cdot 3$ belong to $l=3$ . $(Q_3)$ Can we find a closed form for $R(1,n):=$ $k$ -step at which we make the first $R$ jump? That is, can we find the exact $\delta$ values, depending on $n$ ? The first $R$ jump, when $n$ is prime. In the case of primes $n=p$ , I mentioned we have: $$R(1,p)=\frac12(n+1)+\delta$$ It seems that the following patterns hold: If $p$ is of form $4m+3$ , then $\delta=0$ . If $p$ is of form $8m+5$ , then $\delta=1$ . If $p$ is of form $56m+\{17,33,41\}$ , then $\delta=4$ . If $p$ is of form $1288m+X_4$ , then $\delta=6$ , where $X_4$ contains: {57, 65, 113, 137, 249, 281, 337, 401, 457, 505, 513, 569, 585, 617, 641, 681, 697, 753, 793, 849, 865, 953, 977, 1009, 1017, 1033, 1065, 1073, 1121, 1201, 1233, 1241, 1257} If $p$ is of form $\dots$ And so on. Can we find a closed-form for these patterns (congruence classes) that determine $\delta$ ? What is so special about $p$ modulo $3,8,56,1288\dots$ ? The next one seems to be $21896$ , and if that is true, then $X_5$ would contain: {17921, 11265, 14337, 15873, 7169, 7177, 17929, 21001, 8201, 14345, 13841, 2577, 20497, 9241, 16921, 21529, 9753, 20505, 18425, 16417, 19489, 15905, 16937, 5161, 14897, 2097, 11825, 7729, 4153, 19513, 14393, 1593, 21057, 10313, 16969, 17481, 6729, 3665, 16977, 20049, 7249, 12881, 12889, 20057, 10329, 19545, 9305, 2657, 19553, 8289, 1129, 15465, 9321, 14953, 4601, 5233, 8817, 7281, 1145, 11897, 14457, 15481, 9857, 11393, 13441, 3201, 20609, 7809, 2697, 18057, 20105, 14473, 12433, 5777, 16017, 13969, 5273, 20633, 6297, 673, 8353, 9377, 18593, 1185, 4257, 12961, 19625, 1705, 7849, 177, 17585, 6329, 4281, 193, 9921, 13505, 14529, 5825, 21697, 6857, 1737, 8905, 2249, 16585, 8913, 17105, 8401, 4313, 11481, 15577, 4825, 19681, 11489, 15073, 5345, 1761, 737, 10977, 233, 21737, 7401, 3305, 12009, 17649, 15089, 14065, 16633, 13049, 21753, 20729, 19713, 5377, 5889, 6913, 20225, 1289, 12041, 12553, 1297, 15633, 19217, 9489, 18705, 20241, 785, 3865, 14617, 18201, 7961, 3361, 10529, 12065, 21281, 3873, 809, 17193, 10537, 20777, 6449, 20785, 9017, 13113, 20801, 15681, 6465, 2377, 4425, 18761, 5961, 11769, 8017, 9041, 19793, 11089, 11601, 7001, 8537, 4953, 18265, 11617, 13665, 21345, 11113, 9577, 2417, 13169, 16241, 6521, 10105, 4993, 13185, 16769, 15745, 5513, 11145, 5009, 3985, 21393, 2969, 8089, 921, 7065, 11673, 18841, 18337, 14249, 1961, 6057, 10665, 21417, 16297, 5545, 3497, 12721, 10161, 1457, 20913, 8633, 8121, 12217, 16825, 1465, 449, 5569, 15297, 15817, 7113, 11209, 21449, 4041, 14793, 10193, 17873, 4057, 473, 11225, 17369, 16377, 2017, 6113, 9185, 17889, 10721, 3049, 16361, 12777, 13801, 6633, 15849, 13297, 19441, 4593, 15345, 11761, 20465, 9209} And in this case, the $\delta=7$ would occur.

Let be the number of stones on a circle that the grasshopper can jump on. Let be the number of times the grasshopper visited the stone . Initially, for all . The grasshopper takes a running start and starts jumping around, not planning to slow down. At the th jump say he is on some stone . Say stone is steps anticlockwise, and stone is steps clockwise. He will jump on if , otherwise he will jump on . That is, if is the current stone, then he either moves to: Depending which of the two stones was visited least amount of times till this point. Let be the number of jumps the grasshopper makes before visiting all stones at least once, when jumping on stones placed on a circle. For example, if , he takes jumps to visit all stones, so . The jumps are: WLOG grasshopper prefers anticlockwise , and the zeroth jump sets as starting stone. What can we say about ? One easy pattern I noticed, is that it appears to be: Otherwise, it appears that is much greater. Here is the plot of around first terms of : The red line below is and intersects 's since . All the other terms are above the blue line which is , an exponential lower bound that I guessed holds so far. The green line intersects the origin and the term , which is the farthest term from the average so far. We have . Can we prove all terms will be finite? For fixed the jumping must be periodic eventually, but will that period contain every ? Or would this be too hard? - Since this looks like something similar to proving  Recamán's sequence visits all numbers, which is a known unsolved problem. For comparison, if we would always jump anticlockwise and only switch to clockwise if the , then the sequence would not terminate for all (would not be finite for all ). Can we say anything else about the sequence ? Can we find closed forms for patterns other than when ? I'm not sure how to approach this. Can we determine when the clockwise jumps occur? Since the grasshopper prefers jumping on , maybe finding when jumps on (the jumps) occur, can help characterize the sequence.

The problem: In Arthur C Clarke's story ""The 9 Billion Names of God"" the names of God are all possible sequences in an unspecified alphabet, having no more than nine characters, where no letter occurs more than three times in succession. Out of curiosity, I started playing around with determining how many valid sequences there are in a range. I started with digits repeating in base 10 numbers, at heart it's the same problem as letters repeating in an alphabet. Not being very knowledgable about math, I thought I'd write a program iterate over ranges and count all the elements that match the above condition, then put the results in a spreadsheet to see if a clear pattern of some kind emerged that would let me write an algorithm to determine the number of valid sequences in a given range. I started with the constraint that a digit could only appear once, so in the range 0-99 there are 9 invalid sequences, 11, 22, 33 etc., leaving 91 valid 'names of God'.

It appears that even numbers finally gain the ascendancy for good at $N=222436$. All I've managed to determine is that $E_N \sim\frac{N}{4 \log \left(\frac{N}{4}\right)}+\frac{\sqrt{2N}}{\log \left(\frac{N}{2}\right)}$. I'm also pretty sure than $O_N$ is also $\Theta(\frac{N}{\log N})$ and hence $\rho$ is a constant. I'm not a number theory expert (more an amateur combinatorialist), so I've no idea how hard these questions are.

61,Sequence converges iff $\limsup = \liminf$,Sequence converges iff,\limsup = \liminf,"I want to prove that a sequence of real numbers $\{s_n\}$ converges to $s$ if and only if $\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n = s$.

So the set $E$ of every subsequential limit of $\{s_n\}$ consists of the single point $s$, so $$\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \sup \{s\} = s = \inf \{s\} = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n$$ But the other direction seems more tricky...

It behaves like $\frac{\pi}{2s}$ in a right neighbourhood of the origin, like $\frac{\pi^2}{6s^2}$ in a left neighbourhood of $+\infty$. The origin is an essential singularity and there are simple poles at each $s$ of the form $\pm\frac{i}{m}$ with $m\in\mathbb{N}^+$.

On the other hand I do not see an effective way for controlling  $ \sum_{n>N}\tfrac{1}{n}\,\sin\left(\tfrac{x}{n}\right) $ - maybe by summation by parts, by exploiting the bounded-ness of the sine integral function? Some probabilistic argument might be effective. For any $n\geq 3$ we may define $E_n$ as the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}^+$ such that $\sin\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\geq \frac{1}{\log n}$. The density of any $E_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$ is close to $\frac{1}{2}$, so by a Borel-Cantellish argument it looks reasonable that the set of points such that $|f(x)|\geq \frac{\log x}{100}$ is unbounded, but how to make it really rigorous?

It behaves like $\frac{\pi}{2s}$ in a right neighbourhood of the origin, like $\frac{\pi^2}{6s^2}$ in a left neighbourhood of $+\infty$. The origin is an essential singularity and there are simple poles at each $s$ of the form $\pm\frac{i}{m}$ with $m\in\mathbb{N}^+$. These facts do not seem to rule out the possibility that $f$ is bounded; For any $N\in\mathbb{N}^+$ there clearly is some $x\ll e^N$ such that $\sin(x),\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right),\ldots,\sin\left(\frac{x}{N}\right)$ are all positive and large enough, making a partial sum of $ \sum_{n\geq 1}\tfrac{1}{n}\,\sin\left(\tfrac{x}{n}\right) $ pretty close to $C\log N$. On the other hand I do not see an effective way for controlling  $ \sum_{n>N}\tfrac{1}{n}\,\sin\left(\tfrac{x}{n}\right) $ - maybe by summation by parts, by exploiting the bounded-ness of the sine integral function? Some probabilistic argument might be effective. For any $n\geq 3$ we may define $E_n$ as the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}^+$ such that $\sin\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)\geq \frac{1}{\log n}$. The density of any $E_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$ is close to $\frac{1}{2}$, so by a Borel-Cantellish argument it looks reasonable that the set of points such that $|f(x)|\geq \frac{\log x}{100}$ is unbounded, but how to make it really rigorous? To compute $\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)$ through convolutions with approximate identities seems doable but not really appealing.",,"['sequences-and-series', 'trigonometry', 'inequality', 'fourier-analysis', 'laplace-transform']"

As far as I know, they are currently the fastest series to compute such constants with arbitrary precision (they belong to a highly efficient computing class -P2B3 class- specially fitted to apply the binary splitting algorithm). More details can be found in these links (1) , (2) and (3) I am not sure if some of them has been already published, so the question is very simple. Is any of these series known? NOTE As of Feb.18.2024 question remains open for Eqs.(1), (2), (3), (7) and (11) below. We use the following notation, where the constant $s$ is expressed as $$s=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\,\rho^n\cdot\frac{p(n)}{r(n)}\cdot\left[\begin{matrix}  a & b & c & ... & z \\  A & B & C & ... & Z \\  \end{matrix}\right]_n=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{p(n)}{r(n)}\cdot\prod_{k=1}^n\frac{r(k)}{q(k)}$$ here $p(n),q(n),r(n)$ are polynomials non vanishing for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ , $q(n)$ and $r(n)$ have the same degree $d$ and the convergence ratio $|\rho|$ is the absolute value of the ratio of the leading terms of $r(n)$ and $q(n)$ . The ratio of products of Pochhammer's symbols (rising factorials) is written as $$\left[\begin{matrix}  a & b & c & ... & z \\  A & B & C & ... & Z \\  \end{matrix}\right]_n=\frac{(a)_n(b)_n(c)_n ... (z)_n}{(A)_n(B)_n(C)_n ...

It has a cost $C_s=1.5661$ : $$\begin{equation*}\frac{1}{2\varpi}=C_0\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(-\frac{2^9}{3^9\cdot7^6}\right)^n\cdot\frac{n^2\,P(n)}{R(n)}\cdot\left[\begin{matrix}  \frac{1}{36}&\frac{7}{36}&\frac{13}{36}&\frac{19}{36}&\frac{25}{36}&\frac{31}{36}\\ 1&1&\frac{1}{3}&\frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3}&\frac{2}{3}\\  \end{matrix}\right]_n\tag{2}\label{2} \end{equation*}$$ where $C_0=2\cdot3^{9/2}\cdot7^{5/6}$ and $$P(n) = 99446494228488\,n^5 - 296948949253092\,n^4 + 339735211540956\,n^3 - 185806427026662\,n^2 + 48479683290426n - 4840729282291$$ $$R(n)=-(36n-5)(36n-11)(36n-17)(36n-23)(36n-29)(36n-35)$$ III) The third one for this constant, performs pretty fast.

It gives $C_s=1.1542$ . According to Jesús Guillera (pers. comm. Nov. 2023) some of these series can be bisected or trisected. Particularly Eq.(4) can be bisected  into a $\,_2F_1$ function as $$\begin{equation*}2\varpi=C_3\cdot\pi\cdot\,_2F_1\left(\frac{1}{8},\frac{5}{8};1;\frac{1}{7^2\cdot23^2}\right)\tag{5}\label{5}\end{equation*}$$ for some algebraic value $C_3$ . Eq.(5) is a fast monotone series that has a companion $\,_2F_1$ fast alternating series by applying Euler or Pfaff hypergeometric transformation. This gives $$\begin{equation*}2\varpi=C_4\cdot\pi\cdot\,_2F_1\left(\frac{1}{8},\frac{3}{8};1;-\frac{1}{2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5}\right)\tag{6}\label{6}\end{equation*}$$ being $C_4$ an algebraic value. Note that $7^2\cdot23^2=25921$ and $2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5=25920$ and Eqs. (5) and (6) are dual or twin linearly convergent fast series having practically the same performance. These linked $2\varpi\propto\pi\cdot\,_2F_1$ series are proven by purely hypergeometric methods. In fact, you can start from Eq.(2) here , a $\,_3F_2$ series, and use Clausen's formula to get the (squared) Eq.(6) above. From this, Eq.(5) is obtained applying Euler or Pfaff transformation. Note also that, if the convergence rate is fixed, Clausen's formula, whenever it can be applied, produces from a fast $\,_3F_2$ series a faster $\,_2F_1$ having a lower computational cost by a factor $\frac{1}{3}$ just by reducing the polynomial degree from $d=3$ to $d=2$ . By Googling ""25921 2F1"" Eq.(5) is found in Table 4 here where a different proof was obtained by A. Ebisu using special values of Appell's bivariate F1 function and Goursat hypergeometric transformation . Therefore the bisected series IIIa Eq.(4) is indeed already known which makes a partial answer to this post. IIIb) [New Nov.10.2023. Updated Dec.05.2023] Eqs.(5-6) allow to derive the fastest lemniscate constant $2\varpi$ Ramanujan-type series that avoid to compute $\pi$ . There are currently two fastest series to compute the lemniscate constant by binary splitting. The proofs of both series are obtained following Guillera's article ""A method for proving Ramanujan series for 1/π"" using Table 2 for level ℓ = 2, row d = 13 and also ""WZ proofs of Ramanujan-type series (via 2F1 evaluations)"". The first one was obtained by J. Guillera working from Eq.(6) above. It is found and proven in the Appendix of this last publication -Eq.(48)-. I have found the other one working from Eq.(5). This is $$\begin{equation*}\frac{1}{2\varpi}=C_5\cdot\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{7^2\cdot23^2}\right)^n\cdot(1728\,n+55)\cdot\left[\begin{matrix}  \frac{1}{8}&\frac{5}{8}\\ 1&1\\  \end{matrix}\right]_n\tag{7}\label{7} \end{equation*}$$ with $C_5=5^{3/4}\cdot2^{-3/4}\cdot7^{-5/4}\cdot23^{-5/4}$ . This series has a cost $C_s=0.7872$ . The proof follows straightforward from Guillera's formula by means of the mentioned Table 2, level ℓ = 2, row d = 13, using Ebisu's formula -Eq.(5) above and Eq.(A'''.1) in Table 4 - and expanding the rhs after applying $z\frac{d}{dz}$ to both sides of Euler's hypergeometric transformation $\,_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{-a}\,_2F_1(a,c-b;c;\frac{z}{z-1})$ with parameters $[a,b,c] = [\frac{1}{8},\frac{3}{8},1]$ , $z=-\frac{1}{25920}$ and $\frac{z}{z-1}=\frac{1}{7^2\cdot23^2}$ Lemniscate Eq.(7) above and Guillera's Eq.(48) have been implemented (Dec.02.2023) in y-cruncher's version 0.8.3 Build 9530 as the default algorithms to compute this constant.

For the cube of $\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})$ constant IV) [Updated Feb.18.2024] Series is $$\begin{equation*}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=C_6\cdot\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{3^4}{11^4\cdot23^4}\right)^n\cdot\frac{n^2\,P(n)}{R(n)}\cdot\left[\begin{matrix}  \frac{1}{24}&\frac{7}{24}&\frac{13}{24}&\frac{19}{24}\\ 1&1&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{1}{2}\  \end{matrix}\right]_n\tag{8}\label{8} \end{equation*}$$ where $C_6 = 2^{7}\cdot6^{1/2}\cdot11^{11/6}\cdot23^{11/6}\cdot\pi^2,\,$ and $$P(n) = 4097152\,n^2 - 4097536\,n + 1024535$$ $$R(n)=(24n-5)(24n-11)(24n-17)(24n-23)$$ This series has cost 0.9020 and $\pi$ (Chudnovsky) provides 0.3670 giving a total cost $C_s=1.2690$ . Following @CarP24's answer -also mentioned by Jesús Guillera (pers. comm. Nov. 2023)- Eq.(8) can be bisected into a $\,_2F_1$ function as $$\begin{equation*}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=C_7\cdot\pi^2\cdot\,_2F_1\left(\frac{1}{12},\frac{7}{12};1;\frac{3^2}{11^2\cdot23^2}\right)\tag{9}\label{9}\end{equation*}$$ for some algebraic value $C_7$ . Eq.(9) is a fast monotone series that has a companion $\,_2F_1$ fast alternating series by applying Euler or Pfaff hypergeometric transformation. This gives $$\begin{equation*}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3=C_8\cdot\pi^2\cdot\,_2F_1\left(\frac{1}{12},\frac{5}{12};1;-\frac{3^2}{2^9\cdot5^3}\right)\tag{10}\label{10}\end{equation*}$$ being $C_8$ an algebraic value. Note that $11^2\cdot23^2=64009$ and $2^9\cdot5^3=64000$ and Eqs. (8) and (9) are dual or twin linearly convergent fast series having practically the same performance. These $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3\propto\pi^2\cdot\,_2F_1$ series are proven by purely hypergeometric methods. For instance, from Eq.(42) here , a $\,_3F_2$ series, use Clausen's formula to get the (squared) Eq.(10) above. From this, Eq.(9) is obtained applying Euler or Pfaff transformation. As @CarP24 answered, the bisected series IV Eq.(8) is already known here which makes a partial answer to this post. IVa) [New Feb.18.2024] Eqs.(9-10) allow to derive slightly faster $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3$ Ramanujan-type series that just need to compute $\pi$ instead of $\pi^2$ . There are currently two fastest series to compute this constant by binary splitting. The proofs of both series are obtained following Guillera's article ""A method for proving Ramanujan series for 1/π"" using Table 4 for level ℓ = 1, row d = 7 and also ""WZ proofs of Ramanujan-type series (via 2F1 evaluations)"". The first one was obtained by J. Guillera working from known Eq.(10) above. I have found the other one working from Eq.(9) now that @CarP24 has placed it in his answer below. This is $$\begin{equation*}\frac{\pi}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3}=C_9\cdot\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{3^2}{11^2\cdot23^2}\right)^n\cdot(4800\,n+147)\cdot\left[\begin{matrix}  \frac{1}{12}&\frac{7}{12}\\ 1&1\\  \end{matrix}\right]_n\tag{11}\label{11} \end{equation*}$$ with $C_9=2^{-1/2}\cdot11^{-7/6}\cdot23^{-7/6}$ . The proof follows from Guillera by means of the mentioned Table 4, level ℓ = 1, row d = 7, using Hakimoglu-Brown formula -Eq.(9) above- and expanding the rhs after applying $z\frac{d}{dz}$ to both sides of Euler's hypergeometric transformation $\,_2F_1(a,b;c;z)=(1-z)^{-a}\,_2F_1(a,c-b;c;\frac{z}{z-1})$ with parameters $[a,b,c] = [\frac{1}{12},\frac{5}{12},1]$ , $z=-\frac{9}{64000}$ and $\frac{z}{z-1}=\frac{3^2}{11^2\cdot23^2}$ A non-native implementation of each series has been done for y-cruncher software (a high performance platform to compute a huge number of digits of some classical constants, having set several records in this regard). Custom input files were prepared for each formula and series were tested under this special platform against some known formulas and methods that has been used to break the $2\varpi$ and $\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})$ digits number records. The above formulas outperform providing the fastest binary splitting algorithms to compute these constants. As it is reported here Eq.(4) on Dec.12.2023 and Eq.(8) on Dec.15.2023 were used to beat up to $10^{12}$ the current record of known decimal digits of $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$ and $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)$ respectively.

Updated Dec.05.2023] Eqs.(5-6) allow to derive the fastest lemniscate constant Ramanujan-type series that avoid to compute . There are currently two fastest series to compute the lemniscate constant by binary splitting. The proofs of both series are obtained following Guillera's article ""A method for proving Ramanujan series for 1/π"" using Table 2 for level ℓ = 2, row d = 13 and also ""WZ proofs of Ramanujan-type series (via 2F1 evaluations)"". The first one was obtained by J. Guillera working from Eq.(6) above. It is found and proven in the Appendix of this last publication -Eq.(48)-. I have found the other one working from Eq.(5). This is with . This series has a cost . The proof follows straightforward from Guillera's formula by means of the mentioned Table 2, level ℓ = 2, row d = 13, using Ebisu's formula -Eq.(5) above and Eq.(A'''.1) in Table 4 - and expanding the rhs after applying to both sides of Euler's hypergeometric transformation with parameters , and Lemniscate Eq.(7) above and Guillera's Eq.(48) have been implemented (Dec.02.2023) in y-cruncher's version 0.8.3 Build 9530 as the default algorithms to compute this constant. B. For the cube of constant IV) [Updated Feb.18.2024] Series is where and This series has cost 0.9020 and (Chudnovsky) provides 0.3670 giving a total cost . Following @CarP24's answer -also mentioned by Jesús Guillera (pers. comm. Nov. 2023)- Eq.(8) can be bisected into a function as for some algebraic value . Eq.(9) is a fast monotone series that has a companion fast alternating series by applying Euler or Pfaff hypergeometric transformation. This gives being an algebraic value. Note that and and Eqs. (8) and (9) are dual or twin linearly convergent fast series having practically the same performance. These series are proven by purely hypergeometric methods. For instance, from Eq.(42) here , a series, use Clausen's formula to get the (squared) Eq.(10) above. From this, Eq.(9) is obtained applying Euler or Pfaff transformation. As @CarP24 answered, the bisected series IV Eq.(8) is already known here which makes a partial answer to this post.

81,Have I discovered an analytic function allowing quick factorization?,Have I discovered an analytic function allowing quick factorization?,,"So I have this apparently smooth, parametrized function: The function has a single parameter $ m $ and approaches infinity at every $x$ that divides $m$. It is then defined for real $x$ apart from a finite set of arguments. The animation above shows plots of $f_{m}(x)$ (in white) for $x\in(0, 17>$, while each frame shifts $m$ by $0.05$ starting from $2$ and ending in $17$. In green plotted is a hyperbola $(x, {m\over x})$. Explanation Consider a lattice of integer-valued points $(a, b)$: (the origin $(0, 0)$ is at the left-bottom corner of the picture) Let us draw a hyperbola $(x, {m\over x})$ for real $x$ and for $m = 10$. It is trivial to observe that intersections of the hyperbola and the lattice lead us to factors of $m$, in this case, $10$. For example, the green curve above intersects red dots at $(2, 5)$ and $(5, 2)$. Let us therefore define the function whose results were presented in the first animation: $$f_{m}(x) = \sum_{a, b  \in  \mathbb{Z}} {1\over\lVert (x, {m\over x}) - (a, b)\rVert ^{3}} $$ What this function does intuitively : Choose a constant $m$ whose divisors you wish to seek. Given $x$, calculate point $(x, {m\over x})$ on the real plane. For every possible $(a, b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers, calculate distance of $(a, b)$ from $(x, {m\over x})$ and add inverse of cube of the result to the total sum. Notice that if $x$ and $m\over x$ are integers (and therefore $x$ divides $m$), there exists an integer pair $(a, b)$ whose distance to ($x$, $m\over x$) is zero and when that happens, the series diverges due to addition of a $1 \over \lVert(0, 0)\rVert ^{3} $ term. Plot of $f_{11}(x), x > 0$: Notably, the function only ever approaches infinity at $x\in \{0, 1, 11\}$ ultimately indicating primality of $11$. A little note: I've obtained the plots by coding a procedure that considers $(a, b)$ until distance inverses become less than some epsilon, in which case there is no point in further traversal. Important update #1 I have updated the definition of $f_{m}(x)$ and replaced plots with ones generated by the new implementation, as it was previously using exponent of 2. According to Daniel Fischer, $f_{m}(x)$ with exponent not bigger than $2$ in the denominator must necessarily diverge for every $x$ in its domain. I have therefore decided to use cubes. Important update #2 It appears that in order to finely approximate $f_{m}(x)$, it is enough to simply sum inverses of distances to the four closest lattice points , instead of taking an infinite sum. Let $H = (x, {m\over x} )$ (actual point on hyperbola) Let $h = (\lfloor x \rfloor, \lfloor {m\over x} \rfloor)$ (the closest lattice point to the left-bottom) Our new function is therefore $$f_{m}(x) = {1\over \mathbf{d}(H, h) } + {1\over \mathbf{d}(H, h + (0, 1)) } + {1\over \mathbf{d}(H, h + (1, 0)) } + {1\over \mathbf{d}(H, h + (1, 1)) } $$ In fact, the plots look almost identical. Consider $f_{17}(x):$ For me, it appears to yield a perfectly acceptable estimate. I believe it is especially worthy of our attention that the function looks like it remains smooth even in presence of floor function . Questions: How can we qualify this function? Can we know that it is smooth? Analytic maybe? Is there a way to approximate this function without infinite series? Or maybe a simpler, exact formula? - Partially solved - four closest lattice points finely approximate the result while probably preserving smoothness. I've chosen square of the distance on the premise that it must converge equally well as the series $ \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty {1 \over n^{s}}$ for $s > 1$. Is it actually the case that $f_{m}(x)$ must always converge for $x > 0$ and $x$ not dividing $m$? Solved - $f_{m}(x)$ must always diverge with the exponent not bigger than $2$ in the denominator . Is this function of any use? I know very well that the infinite series are far from efficient, but maybe there's an approximation that would sufficiently well predict factors?

Thus while $|b_i-a_i|$ tends to $0$ , we will never have $a_i>b_i$ . We can now just replace $a_0$ as Achilles start position and $b_0$ as Tortoise start position. And then subsequent positions of Achilles is given by $a_i$ s (Achilles new position is = Tortoise old position, which is the $1^{st}$ recursion). And Tortoise is assumed to move at half the speed of Achilles. Tortoise positions are represented by $b_i$ s. (So, new position of Tortoise = Old Position + 1/2 the distance traveled by Achilles, which is the $2^{nd}$ recursion.)
