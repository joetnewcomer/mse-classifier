Then we can consider the case for $$3^{2(k+1)+2}+2^{6(k+1)+1}=3^{2k+4}+2^{6k+7}$$ Notice that $$ \begin{align}  3^{2k+4}+2^{6k+7} &= 3^{2k+2+2}+2^{6k+1+6} \\ &=3^{2k+2}\cdot 3^2+2^{6k+1}\cdot2^6 \end{align} $$ This seems promising, but I can't find anything to do with it. Yes, we assumed $11|3^{2k+2}+2^{6k+1}$ . However, for $11$ to divide a linear combination of the two terms (as the one we find in our inductive step), we should know $11$ divides each term separately, which is not something we know.

A detailed description is given below. In ""A new approach to the Maximum-Flow Problem"", 1988, by Goldberg, to prove the $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ bound, the author breaks the whole execution into numerous ""pass"", a pass is just like a run in the BFS-style traversal of executing push/relabel on the vertices activated previously. He tries to show that there exists a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ upper bound for the number of passes, and in each pass, the number of non-saturating pushes must be lower than $n$ . The latter statement is trivial, however, the former one is hard for me to show. He established a measure $\Phi$ , the maximum of the label of all active vertices. And it might go up, go down or remain constant in a pass. When it goes up or remains constant, there must be an increase in the sum of labels over all vertices, which has a upper-bound $2n^2$ . So the total number of passes that make it go up or remain unchanged is $2n^2$ . Considering that $\Phi$ is equal (both be 0) after the algorithm terminates (where there are no active vertices) and before the first pass(when using simple initialization), the number of passes that decrease the $\Phi$ is smaller than the upper bound of the number of passes that increase $\Phi$ . So here another upper bound of $2n^2$ can be drawn. (I think here might be problematic, $\Phi$ can follow a pattern like $1, n^2, n^2 - 1, n^2 - 2, ...., 1, n^2$ , here the number of increasing path is at a magtitude $n^2$ lower than that of decreasing pass. Though clearly it is impossible, but proving that need other information on the pattern of the move of $\Phi$ . ) In total, the number of passes has an upper bound $4n^2$ . I could not think of why there must be one label increased (equivalently, a relabel operation triggered) if $\Phi$ stays the same. The proof above is slightly modified to make it easier to follow, but the key statement, as in original text, 'If $\Phi$ is not changed by the pass, some vertex label must increase by at least 1' is still mysterious for me.

We know that $G$ contains at least 4 vertices: $v$ , $x$ , $y$ and $z$ . $G$ must contain at least one more vertex $w$ because otherwise the sum of all degrees ( $2+2+2+3=9$ ) would not equal twice the number of edges ( $2\cdot 4=8$ ).

Also, for any two cities ﻿ $A$ ﻿ and $﻿B﻿$ , on any path from ﻿ $A$ ﻿ to ﻿ $B$ ﻿ passing through other cities, there is a road that is equal or shorter in length than the road from $﻿A$ ﻿ to $﻿B$ ﻿. What is the largest number of roads that can have pairwise different lengths? My attempt at solution: Let's choose any two cities $A$ and $B$ . Then let's take any other city $C$ and look at the path $A\to C\to B$ . The second sentence of a problem specifies that at least one of the roads $AC$ and $CB$ is equal in length or shorter than the direct road $AB$ . By swapping letters $A, B, C$ we get that any three cities form an isosceles triangle, in which legs are shorter or equal in length to the base (1). The first sentence of a problem suggests that cities and roads between them form a complete (weighted) graph $K_n,$ where $n=1000$ , and the question essentially asks what is the maximum number of different road lengths (or edge weights) can exist under these constraints. By considering complete graphs $K_n$ with small $n$ ( $n=3,4,5$ ) we may see that the maximum number of different edge weights (let's denote it by $L$ ) is $L=n-1$ . Let's then make a hypothesis: Hypothesis: For any $n\in\mathbb{N}, n>2$ we may choose weights for a complete graph $K_n$ that meets our conditions in a way that the maximum number of different edge weights is $L=n-1$ . Proof: Let's pick an edge that will have a minimal length and name corresponding vertices $A$ and $B$ . Since it has to satisfy condition (1), there must be at least $n-2$ edges of minimal length connected to vertices $A$ and $B$ (because there are $n-2$ vertices left). That means that there are $n-1$ edges of minimal length in total. Let's say, for simplicity's sake, that all of these edges are connected to vertex $A$ , and the only edge of minimal length connected to $B$ is coming from $A$ . (Otherwise, if there exists an edge $BC$ of minimal length  between $B$ and $C$ , in order to satisfy condition (1) there has to be at least one more edge of minimal length in triangle $BCD$ for any other vertex D.) It means that there is at least one unique length of edges. Let's then remove vertex A and all its edges form the initial graph. Now we get a complete graph $K_{n-1}$ that still meets our condition (1). By repeating all of the previous steps until no edges remain, increasing the minimal length on each iteration, we create a graph that satisfies all our requirements and has $L=n-1$ different edge lengths. OK, that means that for my initial problem the answer is at least $1000-1=999$ , however, now I am running into a problem. I cannot prove that this is, indeed, a maximum possible number of road lengths, nor can I think of the way to increase this number. However, I have a feeling that $n-1$ is actually the answer to the problem, since, again, by brute forcing small numbers of $n$ you come to the answer $n-1$ . I would really appreciate some help in proving or disproving this statement. Thanks!","Problem: 1000﻿ cities are connected by roads, and between any two cities there is a road.

23,Edge Pairing of different Spanning Trees,Edge Pairing of different Spanning Trees,,"I've stumbled across this theorem a while ago Let $S$ and $T$ be two Spanning Trees on the same vertex set. Then there is a bijection $F: E(S) \to E(T)$ satisfying following edge exchange property: $S - e + F(e)$ is a Spanning Tree for all $e \in E(S)$ . I find this quite interesting since it summarizes some nice properties about Spanning Trees. I came up with a proof for this theorem, but I am not 100% sure whether the proof is actually correct. Can anyone verify its correctness? Also, if you think there is an easier way to prove it, let me know. Proof. Let $n = | E(S)\setminus E(T) | $ be the number of edges, that differ from each Spanning Tree. We prove the theorem via induction in $n$ . The case $n = 0$ is trivial since we then have $S = T.$ Now assume that we have $n+1$ edges in $S$ that are not included in $T$ and that the assumption holds for $n$ . Let $e$ be any edge in $T - S$ (such an edge exists since both Spanning Trees contain equally many edges). Since $S$ is a Spanning Tree, there is a fundamental circle $C$ within $ S+ e$ . Since $T$ is a Spanning Tree, we have $C \not \subseteq T$ . Let $e^\prime \in C$ be any edge that is not included in T. We can now define $F(e^\prime) := e$ . The condition of the statement now holds for this pair of $e$ and $e^\prime $ by construction. Let $S^\prime := S -e^\prime + e$ . Then, by the induction hypothesis, we find a bijection $G: E(S^\prime) \to E(T)$ satisfying the edge exchange property. It suffices to show, that $S - f^\prime + G(f^\prime)$ is a Spanning Tree too for all edges $f^\prime \in E(S) \cap E(S^\prime)$ (we can extend $F$ by $G$ then). Let $f^\prime \in E(S) \cap E(S^\prime)$ be such an edge and $f:= G(f^\prime)$ . To see this we, we can partition the vertex set: Note that $S - e^\prime - f^\prime $ contains exactly three connected components. We label these with $S_1, S_2, S_3$ such that $e^\prime$ is a bridge between $S_1$ and $S_2$ and $f^\prime$ is a bridge between $S_2$ and $S_3$ . We know that $S - e^\prime + e$ is a Spanning Tree. Therefore $e$ must be a bridge between $S_1$ and $S_2$ . Since $S - e^\prime + e - f^\prime + f$ is a Spanning Tree by the inductive hypothesis, exactly one of the following cases occurs: $G(f^\prime) = f$ is a bridge between $S_1$ and $S_3$ . $G(f^\prime) = f$ is a bridge between $S_2$ and $S_3$ . Either way, we can substitute $e^\prime$ back in for $e$ and still get a Spanning Tree. Thus, $S - f^\prime + f$ is a Spanning Tree. q.e.d. Let me know what you think about the theorem and this proof. I think it has some nice applications, e.g. for Minimum Spanning Trees it follows that the  bijection preserves the cost function, i.e. $c(f(e)) = c(e)$ for all edges $e \in E(S)$ . Also, note that the proof is highly constructive and one can easily construct an algorithm to compute the bijection. Feel free to comment if you have come up with some other applications.","I've stumbled across this theorem a while ago Let and be two Spanning Trees on the same vertex set.

37,Generating functions and a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence - the big picture,Generating functions and a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence - the big picture,,"I have spent the last few hours trying to understand one way of deriving a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence. As part of improving my mathematical maturity, I am trying to learn to see the ""big picture"" of what I'm doing as opposed to myopically following the details of a derivation or proof and then forgetting most of what I've done within a few weeks or months. Below I will post my derivation so that it can be checked for errors and general clarity, but what I would like also ask what the proper intuition or high-level perspective is on what I've done. As I look over my work, the key takeaways I see are that we put the Fibonacci sequence into the form of a generating function, and in particular we managed to put the generating function into a compact rational form. Once this was done, the rest of the work essentially involved analyzing the rational form of the generating function and extracting information from it until we were able to write the generating function (in its formal power series form) in two different ways, compare coefficients and thus derive a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence. If these observations are apt, then perhaps the big takeaway is that generating functions can be useful when they make it possible to package a sequence into a form that allows algebraic and/or analytic techniques to be brought to bear on the sequence, when it is represented as a generating function. I would appreciate if anyone can tell me whether my perspective is reasonable or not. My exposition: The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \dots$ . The first two numbers are 1, and then every subsequent number is the sum of the prior two. Let $(a_n)$ be the sequence of Fibonacci numbers and $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots$ be the generating function. Consider that \begin{align*} x^2 f(x) + x f(x) &= a_0 x^2 + a_1 x^3 + a_2 x^4 + \dots + a_0 x + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x^3 + \dots\\ &= a_0 x + (a_0 + a_1) x^2 + (a_1 + a_2) x^3 + \dots\\ &= a_0 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots\\ &= f(x) - a_0 - a_1 x + a_0 x\\ &= f(x) - 1 - x + x \text{ (using the known values for } a_0 \text{ and } a_1)\\ &= f(x) - 1. \end{align*} Thus $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x - x^2}$ . Now factor $1 - x - x^2$ as $(1 - \alpha x)(1 - \beta x)$ , so that $- \alpha - \beta = -1$ (or more naturally, $\alpha + \beta = 1$ ) and $\alpha \beta = -1$ . If you solve this system of equations you will end up with $\alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}$ and $\beta = \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2}$ , or the reverse. Now consider the partial fraction decomposition \begin{align*} f(x) &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots\\ &= \frac{1}{1 - x - x^2}\\ &= \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha x)(1 - \beta x)}\\ &= \frac{a}{1 - \alpha x} + \frac{b}{1 - \beta x}\\ \Rightarrow 1 &= a(1 - \beta x) + b(1 - \alpha x). \end{align*} This gives us another system of equations such that $a + b = 1$ and $-a \beta - \alpha b = 0$ (or more naturally, $a \beta + \alpha b = 0$ .) If you solve \textit{this} system of equations you get $a = \frac{\sqrt 5 + 1}{2 \sqrt 5}$ and $b = \frac{\sqrt 5 - 1}{2 \sqrt 5}$ .\ Thus, \begin{align*} f(x) &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots\\ &= \frac{1}{1 - x - x^2}\\ &= \frac{1}{(1 - \alpha x)(1 - \beta x)}\\ &= \frac{a}{1 - \alpha x} + \frac{b}{1 - \beta x}\\ &= a(1 + \alpha x + \alpha^2 x^2 + \dots) + b(1 + \beta x + \beta ^2 x^2 + \dots)\\ &= (a + b) + (a \alpha + b \beta)x + (a \alpha ^2 + b \beta^2)x^2 + \dots \end{align*} which explicitly means that $a_k = (\frac{\sqrt 5 + 1}{2 \sqrt 5})(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2})^k + (\frac{\sqrt 5 - 1}{2 \sqrt 5})(\frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2})^k$ , as desired.","I have spent the last few hours trying to understand one way of deriving a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence.

Hence, every edge belongs to a circle. It is Eulerian , hence every vertex has an even number degree. Adding edges , to a graph with Hamilton circles could do no harm into it's Hamiltonian property so it only impacts the Eulerian property. So we need to examine  , how a graph with two Hamilton circles can be Eulerian. A Hamilton circle , does not repeat vertices so neither edges. If these 2 Hamilton circles are completely disjoint (each one is constructed by n edges) then the Euler one has at least 2n edges Note: There was an extra question in the second one : Find the minimum number of edges for a simple (no - parallel edges), undirected  graph with that it is Eulerian and has at least two different Hamilton circles?",\exists k |Ε|=2k \rightarrow \frac{\sum_{i}^n deg(v_i)}{2}=2k \rightarrow \sum_{i}^n deg(v_i)=4k n \geq 10 n(n-2) \frac{n(n-1)}{2} n \geq 10,"['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'hamiltonicity']"

Let Rapid be the set of rapidly increasing functions. Use a diagonalization argument to prove that Rapid is uncountable. Can someone please verify the following solution attempt? Solution Assume, by contradiction, that Rapid is countable. Then, there is an enumeration $f_0,f_1,f_2,\cdots$ of the elements in Rapid. Let $f_k$ denote the $k$ -th function in the enumeration. Define a new function $F$ as follows, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ : $$F(n) = 2^{\max(f_0(n), \cdots, f_n(n))}$$ Claim 1 : $F$ is not in the enumeration of the elements of Rapid. Proof . For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $F(n) \neq f_n(n)$ . Therefore, $F$ differs from each $f_0,f_1,f_2,\cdots$ in the enumeration. Claim 2 : $F$ is in Rapid. That is: $$F(n+1) \geq 2^{F(n)}$$ $$2^{\max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))} \geq 2^{2^{\max(f_0(n), f_1(n), ..., f_n(n))}}$$ Proof . For the Claim 2 to be true, it's sufficient that: $$\max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1)) \geq 2^{max(f_0(n), f_1(n), \cdots, f_n(n))}\text{ (*)}$$ Let $f_i(n+1)$ be the value of left-hand side $\max$ expression of (*), and $f_j(n)$ be the value of the right-hand side $\max$ expression of (*), where $0 \leq i \leq n + 1$ and $0 \leq j \leq n$ . That is: $$f_i(n+1) = \max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))$$ $$f_j(n) = \max(f_0(n), f_1(n), \cdots, f_n(n))$$ If $f_i = f_j$ , then (*) follows directly, by definition, from the fact that $f_i$ is in Rapid: $f_i(n+1) \geq 2^{f_i(n)}$ . Therefore, in this case, the Claim 2 is true. Now, assume that $f_i \neq f_j$ . Assume, by contradiction, that (*) is false, that is, $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ . Since $f_j$ is in Rapid, we have, by definition: $f_j(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ . But $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ and $f_j(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ imply that: $$f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)} \leq f_j(n+1)$$ $$f_i(n+1) < f_j(n+1),$$ which contradicts the assumption that $f_i(n+1) = \max(f_0(n+1), f_1(n+1), \cdots, f_{n+1}(n+1))$ . Therefore, it can't be the case that $f_i(n+1) < 2^{f_j(n)}$ with $i \neq j$ . So, $f_i(n+1) \geq 2^{f_j(n)}$ , which means that (*) is true, and therefore $F$ is in Rapid. From Claim 1 and Claim 2, we defined a function $F$ that is not in the enumeration of all rapidly increasing functions, but which is in Rapid. This contradicts the assumption that we have an enumeration of all rapidly increasing functions. So, such an enumeration cannot exist.

When you have to convert base a to b where b is a^n you know that n digits of the number in base a = 1 digit in base b. In this case 10 isn't a power of 2 so at best you get $10 = 2^3+2^1$ What this means is that each digit of the given number in base 10 corresponds to 3 digits plus.... something? in base 2.

I write the correspondences up until n+1 digits (exclusive). If this was base 8 instead of decimal I'd only need to write the correspondences until 111_2. When solving this I noticed that the 3 (from the 34) doesn't correspond to 011_2 or 0011_2 but instead to 011_2+1_2=100_2 (because I do this as if I am solving for base 8 and then I add as if I am solving for base 2... because 10 = 2^3+2^1). So basically... 2 to the power that gives you the number closest to 10 (which is 8) and then add what's missing, which is either 0, 1 or 2 (decimal). Using this I get: $$3 = 011_2 + 01_2 = 0100_2 \\ 4 = 0100_2 + 00_2 = 0100_2 \\ 34 = 0100 0000_2 + 0000 0100_2 = 0100 0100_2$$ Only... the answer is 100010 (I'm only counting the integer part to keep it simple).

I know that each unit/digit of that number in decimal is $0111 + 10 = 1001_2$ in binary because what you do is use a power of 2 and then add what's left.. when b is a power of two you don't have to add anything because there's nothing missing. Here it's trickier... if $10 = 2^3+2^1 = 2(2^2+1)$ then maybe a different way of doing this is solving the given digit in base 8, add a zero to the left and then add the excess (mod) to the closest power of 2... in the case of 3 it's one or 01_2 because the closest power is 2...

However, in this case I was just really wondering if I'm doing the right thing, as the 'standard' approach wouldn't work here as the size of the problem is too big. Therefore, I thought of some ways to finalize my answer and I'm not sure if I'm missing any steps in my process. How many non-equivalent 20-bead necklaces can be made if we use 3 different colors? How many can be made with every color appearing at least 3 times? Let's assume we use the colors Blue, Green and Red, denoted by $b,g,r$ respectively. We will first calculate how many necklaces can be made at all, with no restrictions on the amount of colors appearing each time. The group of necklace operations (turning it bead per bead) is isomorphic to $C_{20}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/20\mathbb{Z}$ . Therefore, we can find the terms of the Cycle Index: $\phi(1)=1$ so there's $1$ permutation of order $20; z_1^{20}$ $\phi(2) = 1$ so there's $1$ permutation of order $10; z_2^{10}$ $\phi(4) = 2; \ 2z_4^5$ $\phi(5)=4;\ 4z_5^4$ $\phi(10)=4; \ 4z_{10}^2$ $\phi(20) = 8; \ 8z_{20}$ where $\phi$ denotes the Euler Phi function. Combining this gives the Cycle Index: $$Z(z_1,z_2,z_4,z_5,z_{10},z_{20})=\frac{1}{20}\big(z_1^{20}+z_2^{10}+2z_4^5+4z_5^4+4z_{10}^2+8z_{20}\big)$$ Filling in $3$ for each of the $z_i$ gives the CFB-formula, which will lead to all possible 20-bead necklaces using any of the 3 colors. This gives $$|O|=174\ 342\ 216$$ Now we will look at all the necklaces having each color used at least 3 times. This is the same as looking at all the necklaces that have at least once color used less than 3 times. The latter can then be subtracted from the total number of necklaces possible to get the desired answer. Edit : this was my initial approach but I forgot about terms where only 2 colors were used at all (and thus not all colors were used more than 3 times). This made me have a direct approach again: For the term $z_1^{20}$ we are interested in coefficients of the terms $b^3g^ir^{17-i}$ where $i=3,\dots,14$ and $b^4g^ir^{16-i}$ where $i=3,\dots,13$ up until $b^{14}g^3r^3$ . The coefficients of these terms are $\binom{20}{3}\binom{17}{i}, \binom{20}{4}\binom{16}{i}\dots \binom{20}{14}\binom{6}{3}$ respectively. From the summation we get: $$\sum_{n=3}^{14}\bigg[\binom{20}{n}\sum_{i=3}^{17-n}\binom{20-n}{i}\bigg]=3\ 3 02\ 869\ 446$$ For the term $z_2^{10}$ we look at the coefficients of the terms $b^4g^{2i}r^{16-2i}$ where $i=2,\dots,6$ and $b^6g^{2i}r^{14-2i}$ where $i=2,\dots,5$ , up until $b^{12}g^4r^4$ . Using the same method as before, we get: $$\sum_{n=2}^{6}\bigg[\binom{10}{n}\sum_{i=2}^{8-n}\binom{10-n}{i}\bigg]=40\ 950$$ For the term $z_4^5$ we can apply the same as before, but not only with even numbers, but with any exponent that's a multiple of 4. Our summation will be: $$2*\sum_{n=1}^{3}\bigg[\binom{5}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{4-n}\binom{5-n}{i}\bigg]=300$$ The only possibilities for $z_5^4$ are $b^5g^5r^{10},b^5g^{10}r^5$ and $b^{10}g^5r^5$ . Our summation will be shorter: $$4*\bigg[\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{1}+\binom{4}{1}\binom{3}{2}+\binom{4}{2}\binom{2}{1}\bigg]=144$$ The remaining terms $z_{10}^2$ and $z_{20}$ will not contribute to our counting problem as all the terms $b^ig^jr^k$ will have $i,j,k\geq10$ or either of the exponents being $0$ , which means there are no cases in which all three colors are used at all, so in particular they won't be used 3 or more times. Combining all the coefficients for all the terms using all the colors at least 3 times, we find: $$|N|=\frac{1}{20}\big(3\ 3 02\ 869\ 446 + 40\ 950 + 300 + 144 \big) = 165\ 145\ 542 $$","First of all, I am aware that these types of questions are very common and are around the internet in all shapes and sizes.

So $\neg (P \wedge \neg Q)$ is equivalent to $\neg (\neg (P \implies Q))$ and $P \implies Q$ by double negation so showing that $\neg (P \wedge \neg Q)$ proves $P \implies Q$ .

If this is the case, what is the point in distinguishing proof by contradiction from proof by contrapositive? edit: My thought is that proof by contrapositive is a direct proof while proof by contradiction, in this case, depends on the validity of the double negation law which apparently isn't valid in intuitionistic logic.",P \implies Q \neg Q \implies \neg P P \implies Q P \wedge \neg Q \neg (P \wedge \neg Q) \neg (\neg (P \implies Q)) P \implies Q \neg (P \wedge \neg Q) P \implies Q P \wedge \neg Q \implies\neg P P \implies Q \neg Q \implies \neg P (P \wedge \neg Q) \implies \neg P P \implies Q \neg Q \implies \neg P P \wedge \neg Q \neg Q,"['discrete-mathematics', 'logic', 'proof-writing', 'propositional-calculus']"
