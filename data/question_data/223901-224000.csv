1,Geometric interpretation of a generalized Euler sequence,Geometric interpretation of a generalized Euler sequence,,"Although similar arguments work for $\mathbb P^n$ for any $n$ , let us deal with $X=\mathbb P^1_k$ for simplicity. Recall there is a so-called Euler sequence on $X$ (twisted by $\mathcal O_X(1)$ ): $$ 0 \to \Omega_X(1) \to \mathcal O_X \oplus \mathcal O_X \to \mathcal O_X(1) \to 0.$$ Now, consider projections $p_1,p_2:X \times_kX\to X$ and the following maps $$p_1^*(\mathcal O_X \oplus \mathcal O_X) \to p_1^*\mathcal O_X(1), \quad p_2^*\Omega_X(1) \to p_2^*(\mathcal O_X \oplus \mathcal O_X),$$ which yields a map $p_2^*\Omega_X(1) \to p_1^*\mathcal O_X(1)$ and hence a map $$\mathcal E:= p_2^*\Omega_X(1) \otimes_{\mathcal O_{X\times X}}p_1^*\mathcal O_X(-1) \to p_1^*\mathcal O_X(1) \otimes_{\mathcal O_{X\times X}}p_1^*\mathcal O_X(-1) = \mathcal O_{X\times_k X}.$$ Beillinson showed the map fits into the following short exact sequence ( e.g. ): $$0 \to \mathcal E \to \mathcal O_{X\times_k X} \to \mathcal O_{\Delta} \to 0$$ where $\Delta \subset X\times_k X$ denotes the diagonal. Now, since everything is flat, we get the following distingushed triangle $$  \mathcal E \to \mathcal O_{X\times_k X} \to \mathcal O_{\Delta} \to \mathcal E[1] $$ in $\operatorname{Perf} X$ and for any $\mathcal F \in \operatorname{Perf}X$ , we get the following distingushed triangle $$ \Phi_{\mathcal E}(\mathcal F) \to \Phi_{\mathcal O_{X\times_k X}}(\mathcal F) \to \Phi_{\mathcal O_{\Delta}}(\mathcal F) \to \Phi_{\mathcal E}(\mathcal F)[1] $$ where $\Phi$ denotes the Fourier-Mukai transform. Now, by the projection formula and flat base change (e.g. Section III.2 ), the distingushed triangle is isomorphic to the following: $$ \oplus_{i \in \mathbb Z}H^i(X,\mathcal F(-1))[-i] \otimes_k \Omega_X(1) \to \oplus_{i \in \mathbb Z}H^i(X,\mathcal F)[-i] \otimes_k \mathcal O_X \to \mathcal F \overset{+1}{\to}.  $$ In particular, if we apply this to $\mathcal F = \mathcal O_X(k)$ (say $k\geq 2$ ), then we get $$ H^0(X,\mathcal O_X(k-1))\otimes_k\Omega_X(1) \to H^0(X,\mathcal O_X(k))\otimes_k \mathcal O_X \to \mathcal O_X(k) \overset{+1}{\to}, $$ which looks like some generalization of the Euler sequence.

2,Toric vector bundle - Klyachko's classification,Toric vector bundle - Klyachko's classification,,"I am trying to understand Klyachko's classification of toric vector bundles on a toric variety ( his article: Equivariant vector bundles on toric varieties and some problems of linear algebra). I am reading Sam Payne's version of it as presented in the preliminaries of his article Moduli of Toric Vector Bundles. I am having some troubles understanding two things. The setting: Let $N$ be a lattice, $M = \text{Hom}(N,\mathbb{Z})$ the dual lattice, $\Delta$ a fan in $N \otimes_\mathbb{Z}\mathbb{R}$ , $ X = X(\Delta)$ the corresponding toric variety and $\mathscr{E}$ a toric vector bundle on $X$ . An algebraic action of the torus $T$ on $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})$ , the vector space of global sections, is given by $$ (t\cdot s)(x) = t(s(t^{-1}x))$$ for $t\in T, s\in\Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})$ and $x\in X$ . So far so good. This action induces the following decomposition into T-eigenspaces $$ \Gamma(X,\mathscr{E}) = \oplus_{u\in M}\Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})_u, $$ where $$ t\cdot s = \chi^{u}(t)s$$ for $t\in T$ and $s\in \Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})_u$ . Question 1: Why does this decomposition exist? I have read (Cox, Toric Varieties Porp 1.1.2) that, for an algebraic action, such a decomposition exists if the action is linear and the vector space is of a finite dimension. I see that the above action is linear but cannot see why the vector space $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})$ is finite dimensional. Question 2: I know that for $u\in M$ the character $\chi^{u}$ is a regular function on $X$ . I don't understand why in the above setting, the eigenfuction $\chi^{u}$ is an element of $\Gamma(X, O_X)_{-u}$ Additional questions (after the above were answered thanks to sti9111) Continuing my pursue of understanding Klyachko's theorem, I am trying to understand the following point mentioned both in Payne (p.7) and in Gonzalez (p. 7). Continuing with Payne's notation let $E$ be the fiber at the identity element of the Torus, $x_0$ . Consider the map $\Gamma(X,\mathscr{E})_u\to E$ given by the evaluation at $x_0$ .

For a ray $\rho\in\Delta$ , we denote with $E^{\rho}(i)=E^{\rho}_{u}$ for any $u$ such that $<u,v_\rho>=i$ . My question: both in Payne's proof of Klyachko's classification theorem (p.7) and in Gonzalez's article (p.7), the fllowing is mentioned $E^{\sigma}_{u}=\cap_{\substack{\rho\preceq\sigma}}E^{\rho}(<u,v_\rho>)$ and in Gonzalez, the image of $H^{0}(X,\mathscr{E})_u$ under the evaluation map is equal to $\mathscr{E}^{\rho1}(<u,v_1>)\cap\dots\cap\mathscr{E}^{\rho_{d}}(<u,v_d>)$ .

3,Galois correspondence for non-necessary étale cover of normal integral schemes,Galois correspondence for non-necessary étale cover of normal integral schemes,,"I am struggling at finding a proof for some fact I saw in a paper. I call a variety any integral separated scheme of finite type over a field $k$ of char 0, and a cover of varieties is simply a finite surjective morphism (not necessarily etale). For a cover of normal varieties $\pi: Y\to X$ , I know $Aut_X(Y)$ is isomorphic to $Aut_{k(X)}(k(Y))^{op}$ and then we call $\pi$ Galois if $\#Aut_X(Y)=deg(\pi)$ or equivalently if $k(Y)/k(X)$ is Galois. This is the same definition I found in Milne's notes on Etale cohomology for ""generically Galois"". The paper now tells that for a Galois cover between normal varieties $\pi:Y\to X$ , we have a bijection between subgroups of $Aut_{k(X)}(k(Y))$ and subcovers $Y\to Z \to X$ give by $$H\mapsto [Y\to Y/H\to X] $$ where $Y/H$ is the normalization of $X$ in $k(Y)^H$ . However there is no clear proof of this fact, the paper only mentioning that it is true by Galois theory on fields and a version of Zariski's main theorem for normal varieties si I tried to show it myself. From a subcover $Y\to Z \to X$ , I denote $H$ the subgroup of $Aut_{k(X)}(k(Y))$ such that $k(Z)=k(Y)^H$ . Then I basically want to show $Z$ and $Y/H$ are isomorphic. I know they are birational since they have the same function field so let $f:Z\to Y/H$ be a birational map. I assume the version of Zariski's main theorem the paper is considering is similar to this statement in Liu's book. I don't understand neither why $f$ should be quasi-finite nor why having $f$ being an open immersion concludes $f$ is an isomorphism. Another attempt of myself is taking $U$ an affine open subset of $X$ and then checking $V1,V2,W$ its inverse images in $Z,Y/H$ and $Y$ . That should give me extensions of rings and then by normality, I assume $B_1$ and $B_2$ should both be the integral closure of $A$ in $k(Y)^H=k(Z)\subset k(Y)$ so I could conclude $Z=Y/H$ . The thing is I do not know how to generalize to non-affine schemes and I don't think Zariski's main theorem is involved in this way.

Let $$1 \to A \to B \to C \to 1$$ be an exact sequence of algebraic groups defined over $k$ each with an action of $\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$ . This induces a long exact sequence in cohomology: $$1 \to A^{\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)} \to B^{\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)} \to C^{\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)} \to H^1(k,A) \to H^1(k,B) \to H^1(k,C)$$ Here is Corollary 3 to Proposition 39 in Chapter 1: In order that $H^1(k,B)$ be countable (resp. finite, resp. reduced to a single element), it is necessary and sufficient that the same be true for its image in $H^1(k,C)$ , and for all the quotients $H^1(k,bA)/(bC)^{\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)}$ ,for $b \in Z^1(k,B)$ .

Then the corollary is again applied to a composition series for $B$ dealing with various terms in cases. I do not see how the reduction to the connected case takes place. Let $B_0$ be the connected component of $B$ . Then $B/B_0$ is finite. To reduce to the connected case, Serre applies the corollary to the short exact sequence $$1 \to B_0 \to B \to B/B_0 \to 1.$$ For $H^1(k,B)$ to be finite, it is sufficient that $H^1(k,B/B_0)$ be finite (This is true since $B/B_0$ is finite and $k$ has condition (F), see prop 8. ch 4.) and $H^1(k,bB_0)$ be finite for all $b \in Z^1(k,B)$ . Clearly, twisting by the trivial cocycle $b = e$ reduces to the connected case i.e. showing that $H^1(k, B_0)$ is finite. For nontrivial cocycles $b$ I see that $bB_0$ is still the same group as $B_0$ (and hence connected) but it is equipped with a different action of $\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$ . I am confused because I think the text is implying that we can reduce to the case of showing that $H^1(k,B)$ is finite where $B$ is connected and $B$ has the usual (i.e. not twisted) Galois action of $\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$ .

For what I have understood, I need the comultiplication $\Delta$ on $A$ to induce a comultiplication on $A/I$, which means the map $$ A/I \rightarrow^\Delta A/I \otimes A/I $$ must be well defined, and this translates into $\Delta(I)\subset A \otimes I + I \otimes A$.
