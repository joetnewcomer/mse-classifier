46,"Is there a way to phrase ""continuous"" in terms of ""connected""?","Is there a way to phrase ""continuous"" in terms of ""connected""?",,"This is something of a pedagogical question. Most of us have scratched our heads at some point as to why the definition of ""$f$ is continuous"" requires that the pre image of any open set under $f$ is open, then done a bunch of examples, then convinced ourselves. I think our confusion comes because when we first encounter ""continuity"" we are generally expecting a statement about what $f$ does to the images of sets, and get frustrated when we see a statement about what $f$ guarantees about the preimages of sets. I think that we might be able to restore this by instead looking at subspaces of the topological space and whether they are connected according to their subspace topology. Let's call a subset of a topological space which is connected according to its subspace topology a ""connected subset"". Connectedness is inherently a negative notion (""there does not exist two open sets..."") and thus one is naturally induced to look at a contrapositive -- at images rather than preimages. So I think there might be a way to start from a more-intuitive definition, for example: ""$f: X \to Y$ is continuous iff $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces and the image of any connected subset of $X$ is a connected subset of $Y$."" This would seem immediately intuitive to a student, I feel. And if we start from there, then immediately the contrapositive accomplishes the reversal: ""$f: X \to Y$ is continuous iff the preimage of any disconnected subset of $Y$ is a disconnected subset of $X$."" Now it's clear that the latter is necessary for $f$ to be continuous according to the conventional definition. If $f$ is conventionally-continuous  then when we factor a disconnected subset of $Y$ into two disjoint open subsets, the preimage of each subset is open and the preimages of two disjoint sets must also be disjoint, proving that the subset of $X$ was disconnected, too. However I am struggling with rigorously proving sufficiency and thereby deriving the conventional definition from the intuitive one. The existential quantifiers of disconnectedness seem to really get in my way: for example even if I could somehow state ""for every nonempty open set there exists some other disjoint nonempty open set"" (which is false for the trivial topology but maybe that's not such an issue) the above definition seemingly does not guarantee that the corresponding preimages of the two are open -- maybe this partition of the $Y$-subset has very little to do with the partition of the $X$-subset, for example. So it's not clear to me how to push past these weird existentials and come to ""the preimage of any open set is open"" again. Am I missing some obvious counterexample that shows this whole enterprise is a mistake, or clarifies some extra assumptions I'll need in my definition to make it work? If not, what technique might I use to finish the sufficiency side of the proof?","This is something of a pedagogical question.

However I am struggling with rigorously proving sufficiency and thereby deriving the conventional definition from the intuitive one. The existential quantifiers of disconnectedness seem to really get in my way: for example even if I could somehow state ""for every nonempty open set there exists some other disjoint nonempty open set"" (which is false for the trivial topology but maybe that's not such an issue) the above definition seemingly does not guarantee that the corresponding preimages of the two are open -- maybe this partition of the $Y$-subset has very little to do with the partition of the $X$-subset, for example. So it's not clear to me how to push past these weird existentials and come to ""the preimage of any open set is open"" again. Am I missing some obvious counterexample that shows this whole enterprise is a mistake, or clarifies some extra assumptions I'll need in my definition to make it work? If not, what technique might I use to finish the sufficiency side of the proof?",,"['general-topology', 'continuity', 'education', 'connectedness']"

Now because the basic open sets $X_f = \{\mathfrak{p} \in \operatorname{Spec} (A) : \{f\} \not\subseteq \mathfrak{p} \}$ form a basis for the Zariski Topology it suffices to consider the case when $$X = \bigcup_{i \in I} X_{f_i}$$ where $I$ is some index set.

What are your favourite, maybe eye-opening examples, preferably with properties like you wouldn't expect (not necessarily purely metric or topological properties)? As a starting point I will list some examples which, at this point, no longer really surprise me, but they exhibit some properties which may defy (or expand) intuition: The plane endowed with the center metric (that is, the distance between two points is either the Euclidean distance between them if they lie on the same line through the origin, or the sum of their distances to the origin otherwise). In this example, balls around zero are just Euclidean balls, but balls around any other point look like the union of an Euclidean about origin (which may possibly be empty) and an open interval. This shows that a metric space need not look the same everywhere, and that balls can grow in a very non-uniform way. No matter how large a set we choose, if we endow it with discrete metric. This shows that a metrisable (even completely metrisable and locally compact) space need not be small in the sense of cardinality, and that we can put the structure of a metric space on any set. Further expanding on the ""bigness"" front, for any cardinality $\kappa$ there is a (completely metrisable) Hilbert space of dimension $\kappa$. For suitably large $\kappa$ they can be very large in many different ways, for example, any dense subset of such a space has cardinality at least $\kappa$, they can hold $\kappa$ disjoint balls. On the other hand, any compact subset of such a space (for infinite $\kappa$) has empty interior, and they are still path-connected, so very far from discrete. Related examples are general normed spaces, including operator spaces and abstract Banach spaces. I'm curious some other practical examples of very large metric spaces (which are not normed vector spaces). A kind of meta-example are ultrametric spaces, satisfying the strong triangle inequality (see wiki ). They have the property that every triangle is isosceles, and that any open ball is centered at each of its points. Note that discrete spaces are ultrametric. Classical examples of ultrametric spaces are the Cantor space $2^\omega$ of binary sequences and the Baire space $\omega^\omega$ of sequences of natural numbers. They're both Polish, and even though they're perfect (every point is a limit point), they're totally disconnected. The former is compact, while the latter has the property that no compact set has nonempty interior. If we take a Bernstein set $X$ on the real line (that is, a set such that its intersection with any uncountable closed set is nonempty, and whose complement also has the property), then it is a separable metric space of size continuum, which has the property that every compact subset is countable. From this it follows that no nonzero continuous measure on $X$ is Radon, since every such measure must be zero on all compact sets. This places $X$ on the opposite of Polish spaces among metrizable spaces in a way, since any bounded Borel measure on a Polish space is Radon. Note that any probability Borel measure on a metric space has to be regular, so we can't get much more pathological than that. On a different front, a Bernstein set is a Baire space (the intersection of a countable family of open dense sets is dense), but the associated Banach-Mazur game is undecidable. It is, in many ways, the most pathological a subset of a Polish space can be.

In the case of the (differentiable) manifold $\mathbb R^n$ this one-point compactification turns out to be (homeomorphic to) $\mathbb S^n$, which is again a (differentiable) manifold. This leads to the following question: What does the picture look like in the general case for compactifications of an arbitrary manifold $M$? Although the one-point compactification of $M$ is not a manifold in general (e.g. $\mathbb R^n - 0$); is it possible to view every manifold as an open (dense?) subset of a compact manifold by taking some other kind of compactification? In the differentiable case? In the $C^0$-case?

In the case of the (differentiable) manifold $\mathbb R^n$ this one-point compactification turns out to be (homeomorphic to) $\mathbb S^n$, which is again a (differentiable) manifold. This leads to the following question: What does the picture look like in the general case for compactifications of an arbitrary manifold $M$? Although the one-point compactification of $M$ is not a manifold in general (e.g. $\mathbb R^n - 0$); is it possible to view every manifold as an open (dense?) subset of a compact manifold by taking some other kind of compactification?

Seemingly less well-known is the following common generalization of both nets and filters: Let $X$ be a topological space.  Then a filternet (this is a term I made up) in $X$ consists of a set $I$, a filter $F$ on $I$, and a map $I\to X$ (written $i\mapsto x_i$).  We say $(x_i)$ converges to a point $x\in X$ if for each neighborhood $U$ of $x$, $\{i\in I:x_i\in U\}\in F$. If $I$ is a directed set, then we can take $F$ to be the ""eventual"" filter on $I$, and then $(x_i)$ converges to $x$ as a filternet iff it converges to $x$ as a net.

Then $ \partial A \cap \partial B = \emptyset \Longrightarrow$ $ A \cap B $ is connected. It is a simple statement, but I cannot find a proof neither a counter example. Any ideas are welcome! Update 0: Some comments about this being a general topological result made me realize that an example of space where this doesn't hold is important as motivation. Here is a simple example of such space: Consider the circle $S^1 = \mathbb R / \mathbb Z$ and the intervals $A = (\frac{2}{8}, \frac{7}{8})/ \sim$ and $B = (\frac{-3}{8}, \frac{3}{8})/ \sim$ ( $\sim$ is the equivalence relation defining the circle). Note that they satisfy the conditions but their intersection is not connected: $A \cap B =( (\frac{2}{8}, \frac{7}{8}) \cup (\frac{5}{8}, \frac{7}{8}))/ \sim$ . This is illustrated below. Update 1: I came with a weaker version of this statement that is sufficient for the application I need. Weak Conjecture: Let $A,B$ be open connected sets in $\mathbb R^2$ such that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ and each connected component of $\partial A$ and $\partial B$ is the image of a proper embedding from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R^2$ . Then $ \partial A \cap \partial B = \emptyset \Longrightarrow$ $ A \cap B $ is connected. $\ \ \ $ Proof: $\quad$ First, we will refer to images of proper embeddings from $\mathbb R$ to $\mathbb R^2$ as lines. Note that lines splits the plane into two connected components. In the case that a line $\phi$ is a connected component of the boundary of some connected set $U$ , we can define $D(\phi)$ as the connected component of $\mathbb R^2 \setminus \phi$ which contains $U$ . The other c.c. is denoted $E(\phi)$ . If we denote $\Phi_U$ the collection of all c.c. of $\partial U$ , we can write $$ U = \bigcap_{\phi_i \in \Phi_U} D(\phi_i) \qquad \ \ \ \ \ U^c = \bigsqcup_{\phi_i \in \Phi_U} E(\phi_i)\;. $$ It is important to note that the union above is disjoint. Otherwise, we would get $i_1 \neq i_2$ such that $\phi_{i_1} \cap \phi_{i_2} \neq \emptyset$ , absurd since they are different c.c. components of $\partial U$ . $\quad$ Now we begin the proof. Let $C : = A \cap B$ and suppose $C$ has at least two nonempty connected components $C_1$ and $C_2$ . Note that $ C_2 \subset C_1^c = \bigsqcup_{\phi_{i} \in \Phi_{C_1}} E(\phi_i)$ , therefore $\exists ! \  i_n$ s.t. $C_2 \in E(\phi_{i_n})$ . Since $\partial A \cap \partial B = \emptyset $ , we can suppose without loss of generality that $\phi_{i_n} \subset \partial A$ . However, $C_1 \subset A$ and $C_2 \subset A$ are contained on different c.c. of $\mathbb R^2 \setminus \phi_{i_n}$ , which would imply that $A$ is not connected, absurd. $\qquad $ Q.E.D. The main question remains open for discussion. The understanding of the topology of $\partial U$ is all that we should need to conclude it.","This is the original statement I want to prove: Conjecture: Let and be open connected sets in with the usual metric such that .

Update 1: I came with a weaker version of this statement that is sufficient for the application I need. Weak Conjecture: Let be open connected sets in such that and each connected component of and is the image of a proper embedding from to . Then is connected. Proof: First, we will refer to images of proper embeddings from to as lines. Note that lines splits the plane into two connected components. In the case that a line is a connected component of the boundary of some connected set , we can define as the connected component of which contains . The other c.c. is denoted . If we denote the collection of all c.c. of , we can write It is important to note that the union above is disjoint. Otherwise, we would get such that , absurd since they are different c.c. components of . Now we begin the proof. Let and suppose has at least two nonempty connected components and . Note that , therefore s.t. . Since , we can suppose without loss of generality that . However, and are contained on different c.c. of , which would imply that is not connected, absurd. Q.E.D.

99,A question about the definition of a neighborhood in topology,A question about the definition of a neighborhood in topology,,"Let $X$ be a topological space, and $x \in X$ be a point. There are two prevalent conventions on how to define a neighborhood of $x$: Alternative Definitions (Neighborhood): 1) A neighborhood of $x$ is any open subset $W \subset X$ such that $x \in W$. (This convention is used in Munkres's book for example.) 2) A neighborhood of $x$ is a subset $W \subset X$ such that there exists an open set $A$ such that $x \in A \subset W$. (For example this is the definition in Bourbaki's or Willard's ""General Topology"") Thus, every neighborhood in the sense of (1) is a neighborhood in the sense of (2), but not vice-versa. One often needs to show that a neighborhood of a point $x$ in the sense of (2) is actually open, and often this is a non-trivial verification from the given context. An example that I can come up with now (and this example was a motivation for asking this question) is the following: Let $G$ be a topological abelian group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$ which is also a neighborhood of $0 \in G$ in the sense of 2). Then one can show that $H$ is in fact an open set. [The trick is to observe that for a given $g \in G$, the map $\phi_{g} :G \rightarrow G$ given by for $x \in G, \phi_{g}(x) = g + x$ is a homeomorphism, and so any neighborhood of a point $g \in G$ is of the form $g + U$, where $U$ is a neighborhood of $0$. Thus, for an $h \in H$, $h + H$ is a neighborhood of $h$, and moreover, $h + H \subset H$ because $H$ is a subgroup.] The above proof shows that sometimes proving that a neighborhood in the sense of (2) is open is not completely trivial, while a neighborhood in the sense of (1) is always open. At times like these, I wonder why the second definition of a neighborhood is used at all. But I have learned topology primarily from Munkres, and so I might be ignorant of the advantages of definition (2). So, what do you think are some of the advantages of using (2) as a definition for a neighborhood of a point $x \in X$, where $X$ is a topological space? (This might be a duplicate question.
