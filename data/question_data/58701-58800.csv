1,Is it true that power series with infinite radius of convergence are at most exponential?,Is it true that power series with infinite radius of convergence are at most exponential?,,"Suppose I have a real power series $P(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n/a_n$ with $a_n>0$ which has infinite radius of convergence (ROC). Is it true that I can find constant $c>0$ such that $|P(x)|\leq e^{c(1+|x|)}$ for every $x\in\mathbb R$ ? The answer is obviously true if we consider the exponential power series. In a sense, is the exponential power series the ""worst possible"" power series with infinite ROC? All I have been able to say till now is that $a_n^{1/n}\to 0$ if the ROC is infinite.

4,Representing $\frac{1}{x^2}$ in powers of $(x+2)$,Representing  in powers of,\frac{1}{x^2} (x+2),"I was asked to represent $f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2}$ in powers of $(x+2)$ using the fact that $\frac{1}{1 − x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...$ . I am able to represent $\frac{1}{x^2}$ as a power series, but I am struggling withdoing it in powers of $(x+2)$ . This is what I attempted. $I.$ Firstly, I used the simple expansion $$\ln(x+1) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{x^n}{n}$$ which comes from the fact that $\frac{1}{1 − x} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ...$ . I then noticed that $$\ln(x) = \ln(1+(x-1))=\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(x-1)^n}{n}$$ $II$ . $-f(x)=-\frac{1}{x^2}$ is the second derivative of $\ln(x)$ , so that $$\frac{d}{dx}\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n\frac{(x-1)^n}{n}= \sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n \frac{(x-1)^{n-1}}{n^2}$$ and $$\frac{d}{dx} \sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n \frac{(x-1)^{n-1}}{n^2} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n \frac{(x-1)^{n-2}}{n^2(n-1)}=-\frac{1}{x^2}$$ from what plainly follows that $$\frac{1}{x^2} = -\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^n \frac{(x-1)^{n-2}}{n^2(n-1)}$$ $III.$ Of course, this expansion is not in powers of $(x+2$ ). What I pressumed would be the logical thing to do is to repeat these steps but, instead of the using $\ln(1 + (x-1))$ , using the equivalent $$\ln(-2 + (x+2))=\ln((-2)(1+\frac{x+2}{(-2)})) = \ln(-2)+\ln(1+\frac{x+2}{(-2)})$$ I expected to be able to use this because the second term is of the form $\ln(1+ u)$ where $u$ is some function of $x$ , and we know the expansion of such expression. However, $\ln(-2)$ is nonsense, since $\ln(x)$ is defined only for $\mathbb{R}^+$ . Is there an alternative, better way to do this or am I missing something?

My attempt: Case I: $[0,\infty)$ We form our partial sum $S_m(x) := \sum_{n=1}^{m} \frac{x}{(1+nx)(1+(n+1)x)}$ , hence we have that: $$ |S(x)-S_m(x)| = \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} \frac{x}{(1+nx)(1+(n+1)x)} $$ Picking $x_n = 1/n \in [0,1] \subset [0,\infty) \forall n \geq 1 $ , we have that the series can be rewritten as: $$ | S(x)-S_m(x)| = \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2n)(2+1/n)} \geq \sum_{n=m+1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4n+2}$$ which clearly diverges. Therefore, we have found a counter example of uniform convergence within this interval, since if we would have uniform convergence, no matter what x we pick, the series must converge uniformly. Case II: $[a,\infty)$ Notice that $$S(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{x}{(1+nx)(1+(n+1)x)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left (\frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+nx)} - \frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+(n+1)x)} \right )$$ We can form our Majorant term by calculating the upper bound of the term in the series above and we have that: $$\left |\frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+nx)} - \frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+(n+1)x)} \right | \leq \left (\frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+na)} + \frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+(n+1)a)} \right )$$ Let $M_n := \left (\frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+na)} + \frac{1}{(1+2n)(1+(n+1)a)} \right )$ , and since both terms act asymptotically as $1/n^2$ , it becomes evident that the series of terms given by $M_n$ does converge.

Solution states that comparison test should be used, though it is not stated which one. The one which looks the most promising to me is the one that says that if for two sequences $a_n \sim b_n$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is equiconvergent to $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ . This requires me to find the sequence $b_n$ . So I went ahead, done some gymnastics and found $b_n = \left(\frac{1}{2n} \right)^n$ , meaning that my original series would be convergent. I am wondering is this valid, that is whether I found $b_n$ correctly, or not. They never really explained the process of finding $b_n$ so I am not sure which ""transformation"" am I allowed to do. I hope that someone can confirm my solution, if it is correct, or if it is not, provide an answer that would use one of the comparison tests to determine the convergence of this series. I have not tried other methods, since the comparing sequences is an expected way to solve it, but I think that this could also be done using the root test. For completeness, here is my work for finding $b_n$ . The reasoning I used is that I can remove terms of lower exponents everywhere, and that would still preserve asymptotic equivalence. Again, I am not sure if this is true, as it was never explained properly during the course. I just believe that that is how the process works. I also graphed both series in Desmos and it seemed that they started meeting at some point along the x axis and then continuing to converge towards $0$ together.

So i tried it and here is what i did:- Let $$\frac{1}{F(n)F(n+2k)} = \frac{A}{F(n)} + \frac{B}{F(n+2k)}$$ so by rearranging we can say that: $AF(n+2k) + BF(n) = 1$ Now let $C_0 = F(n+2k)$ then $C_1 = F(n+2k-1) + F(n+2k-2)$ so $C_2 = 2F(n+2k-2) + F(n+2k-3)$ then by induction we can prove that if i repeat this process j times then $C_j = F(j+1)F(n+2k-j) + F(j)F(n+2k-j-1)$ So now let $j = 2k - 1$ F then $C_{2k-1} = F(2k)F(n+1) + F(2k-1)F(n)$ now putting this in to the Eq, of A and B then $AF(2k)F(n+1) + AF(2k-1)F(n) + BF(n) = 1$ now by putting $F(n+1) = F(n+2) - F(n)$ then I will get $AF(2k)F(n+2) + (B+AF(2K-1) - AF(2k))F(n = 1)$ there can be infinite values of A and B satisfying this relation so if I let $A = \frac{1}{F(2k)F(n+2)}$ becaues the first term in the Eq.  will become 1 then $B = \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(2k)F(n+2)}$ By putting this values in the summation I will get $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F(2k)F(n)F(n+2)} + \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(n+2)F(n+2k)}$ now in the video It is showned that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F(n)F(n+2)} = 1$ so I am not going to derive it. Now putting it we get $\frac{1 + F(2k-2)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F(n+2)F(n+2k)}}{F(2k)}$ $\frac{1 + F(2k-2)\sum_{n=3}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F(n)F(n+2(k-1))}}{F(2k)}$ in this I have changed the limit. Now by adding and subtracting some termes I get $Sum(k) = \frac{1 + F(2k-2)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{F(n)F(n+2(k-1))} - \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(2k-1)} - \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(2k)}}{F(2k)}$ Now finnaly I ended up with this $Sum(k) = \frac{1 + F(2k-2)Sum(k-1) - \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(2k-1)} - \frac{F(2k-2)}{F(2k)}}{F(2k)}$ But this is not a direct formulae.

Applications are numerous. Let $S_f$ be a random set of positive integers defined as follows: the positive integer $n$ belongs to $S_f$ with probability $f(n)$ . In other words, for each integer $n$ , generate a uniform deviate $U_n$ on $[0, 1]$ . If and only if $U_n < f(n)$ then add $n$ to $S_f$ . The deviates $U_n$ are independent. Now consider $f(n) = \frac{1}{\log n}$ if $n > 2$ , and $f(1)= f(2) = 0$ . With this particular choice of $f$ , the set $S_f$ has the same density as the set of prime numbers, and behaves in a very similar way. Let us define the following functions (actually, they are random variables): $M(n)$ is the number of elements in $S_f$ that are smaller than $n$ . $T(n)$ is the number of twin pairs $(k, k+1)$ with both $k, k+1 \in      S_f$ and $k \leq n$ . The twins in $S_f$ play the same role as twin primes. It is is easy to prove that $M(n)$ (its expectation) is asymptotically equal to the logarithm integral $\mbox{Li}(n)$ . The same is true for the prime number counting function. Furthermore, the prime numbers themselves is a particular case of $S_f$ , a particular realization of the random set $S_f$ for the same function $f$ . (you need to ignore even integers in the construction process, but other than that, it's straightforward.)

The same result is conjectured to be true for twin primes. It is easy to show that there are infinitely many twin numbers in $S_f$ , and assess whether the series consisting of the reciprocals of these twins, converge. The same arguments could be applied to twin primes, but of course, it would no constitute a proof, just some heuristic argumentation. Are there any useful references related to the approach discussed here?

Let $f_n \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of continuous functions, with $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ for each $x \in X$ . If $f$ is continuous, and if the sequence $f_n$ is monotone increasing, and if $X$ is compact, then the convergence is uniform.

In what follows, I'll try to give a different proof of this result. My Attempt: Let $\varepsilon > 0$ be given. For each $x \in X$ , as the sequence $f_n(x)$ is a monotonically increasing, convergent sequence of real numbers with limit $f(x)$ , so we must have $$ f(x) = \sup \left\{ \ f_n(x) \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\}. \tag{0} $$ Moreover, the set $$ \big( \ f(x) - \varepsilon, \, f(x) + \varepsilon \ \big) = \{ \ y \in \mathbb{R} \ \colon \ f(x) - \varepsilon < y < f(x) + \varepsilon \ \} $$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ , and as $f$ is continuous, so the inverse image $$U_x \colon= f^{-1} \left( \  \big( \ f(x) - \varepsilon, \, f(x) + \varepsilon \ \big)   \  \right) = \{ \ u \in X \ \colon \ f(x) - \varepsilon < f(u) < f(x) + \varepsilon \ \}  \tag{1} $$ is an open set in $X$ and $x \in f^{-1} \left( \  \big( \ f(x) - \varepsilon, \, f(x) + \varepsilon \ \big)   \  \right)$ , because $$ f(x) - \varepsilon < f(x) < f(x) + \varepsilon \tag{2} $$ holds. Furthermore, as $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = f(x), $$ so there exists a natural number $N_x$ such that $$ \left\lvert f_n(x) - f(x) \right\rvert < \varepsilon \tag{3} $$ for all natural numbers $n > N_x$ . The collection $\left\{ \ U_x \ \colon \ x \in X \right\}$ in (1) above is an open covering of $X$ , and as $X$ is compact, so there are finitely many sets $U_{x_1}, \ldots, U_{x_K}$ , say, such that $$ X = \bigcup_{i=1}^K U_{x_i}. \tag{4} $$ Now let us put $$ N \colon= \max \left\{ \ N_{x_1}, \ldots, N_{x_K} \ \right\}. \tag{5} $$ Now for any natural number $n > N$ , we have $n > N_i$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, K$ and so by (3) above we have $$ \left\lvert f_n \left(x_i \right) - f \left(x_i \right) \right\rvert < \varepsilon   \tag{6}$$ for each $i = 1, \ldots, K$ . Now if $x \in X$ is arbitrary, then $x \in U_{x_r}$ for some $r = 1, \ldots, K$ [Refer to (4) above.].

87,A bird flies between two cars infinite times [duplicate],A bird flies between two cars infinite times [duplicate],,"This question already has answers here : How to turn this into an equation and then sum the series? (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . The following question and answer is taken from careerbless A naughty bird is sitting on top of the car. It sees another car approaching it at a distance of 12 km. The speed of the two cars is 60 kmph each. The bird starts flying from the first car and moves towards the second car,reaches the second car and come back to the first car and so on. If the speed at which bird flies is 120kmph then 1)the total distance travelled by the bird before the crash is? 2)the total distance travelled by the bird before it reaches the second car for the second time is? 3)the total number of times that the bird reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically)? I am clear with the explanation available in the mentioned site for 1 and 2. For the third part, i.e., the total number of times that the bird reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically), answer given is infinite times with the explanation proving the infinite sequence. But we know it cannot go on infinite times. It has to be a finite number if we look at it practically. How to explain this? I am puzzled because the explanation looks convincing (infinite times) whereas we know it cannot be infinite times. Please help in understanding this contradiction. EDIT: Adding the explanation(below) from careerbless as advised by @DylanSp for clarify and my aim is to understand why it looks as infinite times(theoretically) whereas we know it is finite practically or where my understanding is wrong. (it was a detailed explanation and that is why I have not added initially) (3) infinite times As explained for the previous case, The bird reaches the second car in $\dfrac{12}{180}=\dfrac{1}{15}$ hour for the first time. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{15}×120=8$ km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes 12-8=4 km. The bird reaches back the first car in $\dfrac{4}{180}=\dfrac{1}{45}$ hour. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{45}×120=\dfrac{8}{3}$ km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes $4-\dfrac{8}{3}=\dfrac{4}{3}$ km. Now the bird flies to the second car for the second time. It takes $\dfrac{\left(\dfrac{4}{3}\right)}{180}=\dfrac{1}{135}$ hour for this. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of $\dfrac{1}{135}×120=\dfrac{8}{ 9}$ km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes $\dfrac{4}{3}-\dfrac{8}{9}=\dfrac{4}{9}$ km.

Sine this goes on repeatedly, the bird reaches the bonnet of the second car infinite times(theoretically)","This question already has answers here : How to turn this into an equation and then sum the series? (2 answers) Closed 8 years ago . The following question and answer is taken from careerbless A naughty bird is sitting on top of the car. It sees another car approaching it at a distance of 12 km. The speed of the two cars is 60 kmph each. The bird starts flying from the first car and moves towards the second car,reaches the second car and come back to the first car and so on. If the speed at which bird flies is 120kmph then 1)the total distance travelled by the bird before the crash is? 2)the total distance travelled by the bird before it reaches the second car for the second time is? 3)the total number of times that the bird reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically)? I am clear with the explanation available in the mentioned site for 1 and 2. For the third part, i.e., the total number of times that the bird reaches the bonnet of the second car is(theoretically), answer given is infinite times with the explanation proving the infinite sequence. But we know it cannot go on infinite times. It has to be a finite number if we look at it practically. How to explain this? I am puzzled because the explanation looks convincing (infinite times) whereas we know it cannot be infinite times. Please help in understanding this contradiction. EDIT: Adding the explanation(below) from careerbless as advised by @DylanSp for clarify and my aim is to understand why it looks as infinite times(theoretically) whereas we know it is finite practically or where my understanding is wrong. (it was a detailed explanation and that is why I have not added initially) (3) infinite times As explained for the previous case, The bird reaches the second car in hour for the first time. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes 12-8=4 km. The bird reaches back the first car in hour. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes km. Now the bird flies to the second car for the second time. It takes hour for this. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes km. The bird reaches back the first car in hour. In this time, the cars together covers a distance of km and therefore the distance between the cars becomes km. Now the bird flies to the second car for the third time. It takes hour for this. so on.
