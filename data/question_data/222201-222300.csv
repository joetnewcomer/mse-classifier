Given a presheaf $\mathscr F$ on $X$, we define a topological space $Spe(\mathscr F)$, called the espace etale of $\mathscr F$, as follows. As a set, $Spe(\mathscr F) = \bigcup _{P \in X} \mathscr F$. We define a projection map $\pi : Spe(\mathscr F )\to X$ by sending $s\in \mathscr F_P$ to $P$. For each open set $U \subseteq X$ and each section $s \in \mathscr F(U)$, we obtain a map $\bar s : U\to Spe(\mathscr F)$by sending $P \mapsto s_P$, its germ at $P$. This map has the property that $\pi \circ \bar s = id_U$, in other words, it is a ""section"" of $\pi$ over $U$. We now make $Spe(\mathscr F)$ into a topological space by giving it the strongest topology such that all the maps $\bar s : U\to Spe(\mathscr F)$ for all $U$, and all $s \in \mathscr F(U)$, are continuous. Now show that the sheaf $\mathscr F^+$ associated to $\mathscr F$ can be described as follows: for any open set $U \subseteq X, \mathscr F^+ (U)$ is the set of continuous sections of $Spe(\mathscr F)$ over $U$. In particular, the original presheaf $\mathscr F$ was a sheaf if and only if for each $U$, $\mathscr F (U)$ is equal to the set of all continuous sections of $Spe(\mathscr F)$ over $U$. I understood all but the last line. If $\mathscr F$ was a sheaf, $\mathscr F$ is isomorphic to $\mathscr F^+$ and so for each $U$, $\mathscr F (U)$ is equal to the set of all continuous sections of $Spe(\mathscr F)$ over $U$. But the converse is unclear to me. In general the map $\theta : \mathscr F \to \mathscr F^+$ is not injective since the injectivity requires sheaf conditions. In this situation how can we regard the elements of $\mathscr F(U)$ as sections of $Spe(\mathscr F)$ over $U$? Is injective the map $\theta : \mathscr F \to \mathscr F^+$ even in the case of presheaf $\mathscr F$? $\theta$ is defined by $ s \mapsto (\bar s : P \mapsto s_P )$.","The problem is following. 1.13 Espace Etale of a Presheaf.

I have a question about a proof. First of all I'll write the important definitions that Hartshorne uses. Let $Y\subset \mathbb{A}^n$ be a quasi-affine variety. A function $f:Y\to \mathbb{k}$ is said to be regular at $P\in Y$ if is an open neighborhood $U$ of $P$ such that $U\subset Y$ and polynomials $g,h\in A=\mathbb{k}[x_1,...,x_n]$ such that $h$ is nowhere zero on $U$ and $f=g/h$ on $U$. We say that $f$ is regular at $Y$ if is regular at each $P\in Y$. We denote by $O(Y)$ the ring of all regular functions on $Y$. If $P\in Y$, we define the local ring of $P$ on $Y$, $O_P$ to be the ring of germs of regular functions on $Y$ near $P$. In other words, an element of $O_P$ is a pair $\left<U,f\right>$ where $U$ is an open neighborhood of $P$ and $f$ is regular on $U$. And where we identify two pairs $\left<U,f \right>$ and $\left<V,g \right>$ if $f=g$ on $U\cap V$. Finally we define the function field $K(Y)$ as the set of equivalence relations, given by elements of the form $\left<U,f \right>$ for some $U$ open subset of $Y$ (not necessary containing $P$). The operations that turns $O_p$ and $K(Y)$ into a rings an actually $K(Y)$ into a field are the usual for germs. I'm reading the proof of Theorem $3.2$, I don't understand the proof of part $d)$.

4,The regular functions on an open subset $U$ of an affine variety $X$ are the polynomials on $A(X)$.,The regular functions on an open subset  of an affine variety  are the polynomials on .,U X A(X),"This is an exercise of Gathmann's Algebraic Geometry. Show that the regular functions on an open subset $U$ of an affine variety $X$ are the polynomials on $A(X)$, if $A(X)$ is a UFD and $U$ is the complement of an irreducible subvariety of codimension at least 2 in $X$. There was an example showing that regular functions on $U=A^2\backslash\{0\}$ are polynomials. I am trying to use the same idea in that example. Let $V\subsetneq V_0 \subsetneq V_1 \subset X$ be a chain of irreducible varieties. Let $\phi$ be a regular function on $U$. My idea is: if we can find two irreducible functions $f_1, f_2$ such that $V\subsetneq V(f_1), V\subsetneq V(f_2)$, then $\phi=\frac{g_1}{f_1^n}$ on $D(f_1)$ and $\phi=\frac{g_2}{f_2^m}$ for some $g_1,g_2\in A(X)$ and $m,n\in N$. ($D(f)$ here means the distinguished open subset of $f$ in $X$, i.e., the set where $f$ is not equal to $0$ in $X$.) Suppose $f_1$ does not divide $g_1$, $f_2$ does not divide $g_2$. Then on $D(f_1)\cap D(f_2)$, we have $g_1f_2^m=g_2f_1^n$. Since $V(g_1f_2^m-g_2f_1^n)$ is closed, we also have $g_1f_2^m=g_2f_1^n$ on the closure of ${D(f_1)\cap D(f_2)}$ which is $X$. Then because of the irreducibility of $f_1,f_2$ and $A(X)$ is a UFD, we can prove that $m=n=0$. That proves that $\phi$ is a polynomial. Sorry for the long post. I'm not sure whether this is on the right track. Also I don't know how to show that I can find the irreducible $f_1, f_2$. Or they are probably not really irreducible, but product of linear factors.

But since $\pm 4 = \pm 1 \pmod {\mathbb{Q}^{\star ^2}}, \\ p^2 = \pm 1 \pmod {\mathbb{Q}^{\star ^2}}, \\ 4p = \pm 2p \pmod {\mathbb{Q}^{\star ^2}}, \\ 2p^2 = \pm 2p \pmod {\mathbb{Q}^{\star ^2}}, \\ 4p^2 = \pm 1 \pmod {\mathbb{Q}^{\star ^2}}$ $b_1 \ : \ \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm p, \pm 2p$ So, we have to check if the following equations have a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$ with $xy \neq 0$: $$\\z^2=x^4-4p^2y^4\\z^2=-x^4+4p^2y^4\\z^2=2x^4-2p^2y^4\\z^2=-2x^4+2p^2y^4\\z^2=px^4-4py^4\\z^2=-px^4+4py^4\\ z^2=2px^4-2py^4\\z^2=-2px^4+2py^4$$ I think that the only two equations that have a solution in $\mathbb{Z}$ with $x \cdot y \neq 0$ are these: $z^2=2px^4-2py^4$ and $z^2=-2px^4+2py^4$. Am I right? So, $\overline{\alpha} \overline{\Gamma}=\{ \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} , -4p^2 \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}}, 2p \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}}, -2p \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} \} = \{ \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} , -\mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}}, 2p \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}}, -2p \mathbb{Q}^{{\star}^{2}} \} \Rightarrow |\overline{\alpha} \overline{\Gamma}|=4$ Therefore: $$2^r=\frac{1 \cdot 4}{4}=1 \Rightarrow r=0$$ Have I done something wrong?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"

Suppose that it is also connected. $G$'s action on itself by (right or left) multiplication induces an action of $G$ on its coordinate ring $k[G]$. I have been convinced by the proof I am studying that there exists a finite-dimensional $k$-linear subspace $W\subset k[G]$ that is $G$-invariant and on which $G$ acts faithfully: essentially, if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are $k$-algebra generators for $k[G]$, then all the $g(f_i)$'s live in a finite-dimensional subspace of $k[G]$ and this is $W$. This gives us an inclusion $$\varphi:G\hookrightarrow GL(W)$$ so that $G$ is realized as a subgroup of $GL(W)\cong GL_n$ for $n=\dim W$. The argument I am studying now asserts that $\varphi$ is a morphism (with the variety structure on $GL(W)$ given by its identification with $GL_n\subset k^{n\times n}\cong \mathbb{A}_k^{n^2}$) and deduces that the image of $\varphi$ is a closed subvariety of $GL(W)$.

The most general variety I'm dealing with are quasi-projective varieties, and I couldn't tell you the definition of a general variety (well, I could, but I wouldn't know what I was talking about). As such I'm getting in a fine muddle over definitions and equivalences of definitions. In my notes, the function field $K(X)$ of an irreducible affine variety is defined to be the field of fractions of its coordinate ring $K[X]$. Okay, fine, I'm happy with that. I can see that under this definition, functions in the function field (which I think are called rational functions ) look like quotients of polynomials, have (possibly) many different representations and are not (in general) defined everywhere. In fact, the only rational functions which are defined everywhere on $X$ (i.e. are regular on the whole of X) are those from the coordinate ring $K[X]$. Now it's not too hard to see that, under this definition, $\displaystyle K(X) = \bigcup _{U \ \mathrm{Zariski \ open \ affine}} k[U]$. My notes then tell me to ""observe"" that if $U \subseteq X$ is Zariski open and $X \backslash U$ is a hyperplane (so $U$ is also affine), then $k(U) = k(X)$. I cannot see why this is true . By the above equality, I can see that rational functions on $X$ are functions which are ""locally polynomial"", i.e. functions which are polynomial maps on some open affine neighbourhood in $X$. $X$ being irreducible implies any two such open neighbourhoods have non-empty intersection, which feels like a relevant observation but I don't know what to do with it. I'm then told that if $X$ is an arbitrary irreducible variety, we can define $K(X) = K(U)$ for $U$ any affine open neighbourhood in $X$ I'd much appreciate an enlightening statement that makes all this premature learning feel somewhat more worthwhile. I've seen another definition of a function field for a projective variety $V$, namely that it's quotients of homogeneous polynomials (where numerator and denominator have the same degree), modulo the fairly obvious equivalence relation.

Can someone please verify this? Lemma. If $A \to B$ is an integral extension of rings, then $\dim A = \dim B$ . This follows from the going up theorem. Proof that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] = n$ . It's clear that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \geq n$ , so we proceed by induction on $n$ to show that $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \leq n$ . The base case is trivial. Now fix $m$ , and suppose $\dim k[x_1, \ldots, x_m] = m$ .

Assume without loss of generality that $P_0 = 0$ . Choose any non-zero element of $P_1$ , and decompose it into irreducible factors. Since $P_1$ is prime, at least one of these factors $f$ lies in $P_1$ , so now consider the strictly increasing chain of primes $$0 \subset (f) \subset \cdots \subset P_s.$$ Since $f$ has degree at least 1, choose any $x_i$ that appears in the expression of $f(x_1, \ldots, x_{m+1})$ . (Without loss of generality, $x_i = x_{m+1}$ .) Viewing $f$ as a polynomial in $k[x_1, \ldots, x_{m}][x_{m+1}]$ , it is still irreducible, so we now have a finite (hence integral) extension $$k[x_1, \ldots, x_m] \to \frac{k[x_1, \ldots, x_m][x_{m+1}]}{(f)}.$$ By the earlier lemma and the inductive hypothesis, the right side has dimension $m$ .

I've been studying rational curves recently and it seems completely natural to expect this to be the case, but I haven't been able to come up with a proof or counterexamples. The image of $\mathbb{P}^1$ by a nonconstant morphism $\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ is an irreducible curve, and I was hoping that I could describe every rational plane curve in this way. The only if direction seems to be closely related to the question of whether a birational map $\mathbb{P}^1\dashrightarrow C$ can be extended to a morphism $\mathbb{P}^1\rightarrow C$, but I cannot seem to find a reference for the truth of this statement either. My primary interest is for when the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, if this can affect the answer.

98,How is a Stack the generalisation of a sheaf from a 2-category point of view?,How is a Stack the generalisation of a sheaf from a 2-category point of view?,,"A stack is usually given in terms of: -A category $F$ fibered over another $C$ such that the functor $Hom(x,y), x,y \in F(\alpha), \alpha \in C$ is a sheaf -The descent data are effective. There is an equivalent definition , using the Grothendieck construction, which is a correspondence between fibered categories and pseudofunctors in $Cat$. Given this correspondence a stack becomes a (contravariant) pseudofunctor such that descent is effective. Now, with this definition in mind it seems obvious that a stack is a generalised sheaf. But here is my doubt: When defining a sheaf $T$ over a space $X$, is not unusual to see the following diagram (naively) $ T(X) \rightarrow T(U) \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} T(U \cap U)$ While, saying that descent data are effective is like asking a similar diagram, but there is the difference that here descent satisfies cocycle condition, something which is naively in $U \cap U \cap U$. Recalling that (for example) locally constant sheaves automatically satisfy the cocycle condition because of their correspondent covering spaces do. So my question is, at the light of my interpretation, the cocycle condition seems to me the only obstruction to the fact that a stack is a generalised sheaf. Am i wrong?

I want to show this: Suppose $X$ is projective (over an infinite field), $\mathfrak{F}$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$ with support of dimension $= n$, and $\mathfrak{L}$ is a line bundle on $X$. Show that $\chi(\mathfrak{L}^{\otimes m}\otimes \mathfrak{F})$ is a polynomial with degree at most $n$, and the coefficient of $m^n$ is $(\mathfrak{L}^n\cdot \mathfrak{F})$ Hint: Expanding $(\mathfrak{L}^{n+1}\cdot (\mathfrak{L}^{\otimes i}\otimes \mathfrak{F}))=0$ to get a  recursion for $\chi (\mathfrak{L}^m \otimes \mathfrak{F})$. For the case that $\mathfrak{L}$ is very ample, I can obtain the result by induction on $n$ as follows: The case $n=1$ follows from Riemman Roch for nonreduced curves (Exercise 18.4 S). And if $n>1$, then I can find a global section $s$ of $\mathfrak{L}$, such that $s$ does not passes through the assocaited points of $\mathfrak{F}$.
