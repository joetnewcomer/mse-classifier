Still confused after staring it for 2 hours (3 after writing this) =( Can someone help me out on some ideas that confuses me? This is the proof in text: (1) The pole set of a rational function is an algebraic subset of $V$. (2) $\Gamma (V)=\cap_{P\in V}\mathcal{O}_P(V)$ Proof. Suppose $V\subset A^n$. For $G\in k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$, denote the residue of $G$ in $\Gamma (V)$ by $\bar G$. Let $f\in k(V)$. Let $J_f = \lbrace G \in k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]\;|\; \bar Gf \in \Gamma (V)\rbrace$. Note that $J_f$ is an ideal in $k[X_1,\dots ,X_n]$ containing $I(V)$, and the points of $V(J_f)$ are exactly those points   where $f$ is not defined. This proves (1). If $f\in \cap_{P\in V}\mathcal{O}_P(V), V(J_f)=\emptyset$, so $1\in J_f$ (Nullstellensatz!), i.e., $1\cdot f= f\in \Gamma (V)$, which proves (2). Firstly, since $\Gamma(V)$ is not a rational function, I assume the goal of $J_f$ is to ""remove"" the denominator of $f$. If that is the case, suppose $f=a/b$, where $a,b\in \Gamma(V)$. Then $J_f=\lbrace b\cdot g\;|\;g\in k[X_1,\dots,X_n]\rbrace$. Is this right? (For simplicity I assume $a,b$ has no common factor) If $b\cdot g\in I(V)$, then $\bar {(bg)} = 0$ and $\bar {(bg)}f=0\in\Gamma(V)$. I suppose this is why $I(V)\subset J_f$. I have no idea why $V(J_f)$ describes the points where $f$ is not defined. Clearly if $f$ is not defined at some $P$, $b(P)=0$ and hence $(bg)(P)=0\implies P\in V(J_f)$. But on the other hand, let $P\in V(J_f)$ and $h=b\cdot g\in J_f$. Then $h(P)=0$ and $h(P) = (bg)(P)\implies b(P)g(P)=0$ So the proof implies that $b(P)=0$, which means $g(P)\neq 0$ I am guessing that if $g(P)=0$ then $\bar {(bg)}f\not\in\Gamma(V)$, but I do not know why. Finally, I am also unable to see why this process proves (1). P.S. I am also not quite sure how the part on ""residue of $G$ in $\Gamma(V)$ by $\bar G$"" comes into play.

73,Finding a pencil of elliptic curves parametrized by a given modular surface,Finding a pencil of elliptic curves parametrized by a given modular surface,,"The following is an attempt to formulate a couple of questions which have been lurking in the back of my mind for a while. I'm sorry if this is long, or if my terminology is not correct, or if my notation is non-standard, or if it turns out that I didn't understand a single thing that I thought I understood. Suppose we are given a genus $0$ congruence subgroup $G$ of $\Gamma=PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. The (compactified) modular surface $X_G={\mathbb{H}/G}$ is then a degree $n=|\Gamma:G|$ covering of $X=\mathbb{H}/\Gamma$. Let $K'=\mathbb{C}(w)$ denote the function field of $X_G$ and $K=\mathbb{C}(j)$ denote the function field of $X$. If $G$ is normal in $\Gamma$, the field extension $K'/K$ is a Galois extension with Galois group $\Gamma/G$. Klein's $j$ function can be written as a rational function in $w$, of degree $n$. Now each elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{C}$ corresponds to a point of $X$. We can write such a curve explicitly as the locus of zeroes of a cubic in $\mathbb{CP}^2$; its coefficients are rational in $j$. For almost all choices of $E$, there are $n$ points of $X_G$ lying over $E$. In some cases, these points are known to correspond to some pairs $(E, S)$, where $S$ is some sort of substructure of $E$ (for example a ""level structure""). What's not completely obvious to me is that such pairs $(E,S)$ should also be given by a cubic or quadric equation in normal form, whose coefficients are rational in $w$. Here's an example. The group $\Gamma(2)$ is normal in $\Gamma$; the quotient $\Gamma/\Gamma(2)$ is isomorphic to $S_3$. The projection map $X_{\Gamma(2)} \to X$ is a six-sheeted ramified covering. The generator for $K'$ is then the modular function $\lambda$. The points of $X_{\Gamma(2)}$ correspond to pairs $(E, S)$, where $S$ is a basis (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) for the $2$-torsion subgroup of $E$. Since this group is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, there are indeed $6$ different choices of bases for it over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Now the fascinating thing is that we can consider such a curve as given by an equation in Legendre normal form $y^2=z(z-1)(z-\lambda)$. For most choices of $\lambda$, there are precisely six curves, in this form, which are isomorphic to this one; the other corresponding values of $\lambda$ are related by the action of $\Gamma/\Gamma(2)$. Now my first question is: how would one ""discover"" the normal form $y^2=z(z-1)(z-\lambda)$, given only the group $\Gamma(2)$? Assume, perhaps, that we know (at least) the normal form associated to $j$. Given any subgroup $G$ of $\Gamma$, can we find a normal form associated to $G$ in this manner? If the genus of $X_G$ is bigger than $0$, can we hope, perhaps, to find a similar construction? My second question is a bit more vague: what are other modular surfaces moduli spaces for? This is understood in some specific cases, but is a general answer to be hoped for? Are the examples which are understood well understood? Can we hope to associate to each modular surface a normal form, in which the extra ""structure"" $S$ (whatever it may be) is encoded?

82,Can the formation of Kähler differentials be seen as a functor into the category of modules (without specifying the ring of scalars)?,Can the formation of Kähler differentials be seen as a functor into the category of modules (without specifying the ring of scalars)?,,"In an Algebraic Geometry course, I've seen the definition of the $A$ -module of Kähler differentials $\Omega_A^1$ given a $k$ -algebra $A$ ( $k$ is a field). Then if $X$ is a variety, we defined the sheaf of 1-forms $\Omega_X^1$ on $X$ as the sheafification of the presheaf $\Omega^{1,p}_X$ that maps an open set $U \subseteq X$ to the $\mathcal{O}_X(X)$ -module $\Omega^1_{\mathcal{O}_X(U)}$ and that maps an inclusion $V \subseteq U$ to the map $\Omega^1_{\mathcal{O}_X(U)} \to \Omega^1_{\mathcal{O}_X(V)}$ induced by the $k$ -algebra map that is restriction from $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ to $\mathcal{O}_X(V)$ . This prehseaf seems to me like a composition of the two functors $\mathcal{O}_X$ and $\Omega^1$ , but in order to show this I need to precisely define $\Omega^1$ as a functor. We have that $\Omega^1$ takes a $k$ -algebra $A$ and sends it to an $A$ -module $\Omega^1_A$ . Since the ring of scalars over which this is a module depends on the $k$ -algebra itself, we can't define $\Omega^1$ as a functor $k\text{-alg} \to \text{R-Mod}$ for a fixed ring $R$ . Instead it seems it goes into a general category of modules, without fixing the ring of scalars. (Update from the future: I later realised that we can just say that the codomain is the category of $k$ -modules, i.e. $k$ -vector spaces, but I'm still interested in the question below.) Can we see $\Omega^1$ as a functor from $k\text{-alg} \to \text{Mod}$ where $\text{Mod}$ is the category described below? I made my own candidate definition of $\text{Mod}$ which turned out to be the same as the one mentioned here . Define $\mathrm{Mod}$ to be a category whose objects are modules over any ring, i.e. tuples of the form $(M, A, \cdot)$ where $M$ is an abelian group (the operation is implicit), $A$ is a ring, and $\cdot \colon A \times M \to M $ is a scalar multiplication satisfying the axioms of a module. The morphisms of $\mathrm{Mod}$ from $(M, A, \cdot)$ to $(N, B, \star)$ consist of pairs $(\phi, \sigma)$ where $\sigma\colon A \to B$ is a ring homomorphism and $\phi \colon M \to N$ is an $A$ -module homomorphism if we view $N$ as an $A$ -module $(N, A, \cdot_N)$ by setting $a \cdot_N n := \sigma(a) \star n$ for all $a \in A$ and $n \in N$ .

85,Question on a (presumably) basic $O_X$-module isomorphism,Question on a (presumably) basic -module isomorphism,O_X,"I'm working my way through The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry and want to double-check my work and thinking (and more than likely my notation) on the following question it poses: Exercise: If $\mathcal{F}$ is an $\mathcal{O}_X$ -module, then show that $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F}) \cong \mathcal{F}$ . The text provides the hint that 1 ""generates"" (in a reasonable sense) $\mathcal{O}_X$ . My idea in broad strokes is to use the following: Use the fact that we know there is a canonical isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_x$ and $Hom_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}\left(\mathcal{O}_{X,x},\mathcal{F}_x\right)$ by virtue of the fact that $\mathcal{F}_x$ is a $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ -module. A morphism $\Psi:\mathcal{G}\to \mathcal{H}$ of $\mathcal{O}_X$ modules is an isomorphism if and only if it induces an isomorphism of the stalks $\Psi_x:\mathcal{G}_x \to \mathcal{H}_x$ for all $x\in X$ . Since the goal is an isomorphism between $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})$ and $\mathcal{F}$ , such an isomorphism would require that $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})_x \cong Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) $$ as $Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}-$ modules. The right-hand side clearly has the structure of an $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ module, and the right-hand side can be seen to have such structure as each $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})(U) $$ has the structure of a $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)-$ module, so taking direct limits gives the required structure. To see that $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})_x \cong Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) $$ we consider an element $\varphi_x \in Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})_x$ and $U$ an open set containing $x$ such that $$ \varphi \in Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})(U) = Mor_{\mathcal{O}_U}\left(\mathcal{O}_U, \mathcal{F}|_U\right). $$ Then $\varphi$ , being a morphism of $\mathcal{O}_U-$ modules, induces a morphism on the stalks, i.e an element of $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{U,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{U,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ . Since for all $V\subset U$ we have $\mathcal{O}_U(V) = \mathcal{O}_X(V)$ , and $\mathcal{F}|_U(V)=\mathcal{F}(V)$ , it follows that the induces morphism on stalks is also an element of $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ . Since this takes maps to themselves, it commutes with all required structures to be a morphism of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)-$ modules. To see this mapping has to be injective, assume that $\varphi_x \in Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X}, \mathcal{F})_x$ induces the trivial map in $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ then it must be the case that $\varphi_x(1) = 0$ , where $1$ is multiplicative identity of the ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ and $0$ is the identity of the abelian group $\mathcal{F}_x$ . As such, there must be some $V\subset X$ such that $1\in \ker\varphi(V)$ . But this means that $\varphi(V)$ is the trivial map, thus the map $\varphi_x$ is itself the trivial map. Thus the only map that can induce the identity of $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ is the identity of $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X}, \mathcal{F})_x$ , so our proposed mapping is injective. To see the desired mapping is surjective, let $\psi \in Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ . Then we can uniquely identify $\psi$ with some element $f_x \in \mathcal{F}_x$ (picked as $\psi(1) = f_x \in \mathcal{F}_x$ ). Thus there is some open set $V$ containing $x$ and some morphism $\tilde{\psi}\in Mor(\mathcal{O}_{V},\mathcal{F}|_V)$ such that $\tilde{\psi}(V)(1) = f \in \mathcal{F}(V)$ . But since $$ res_{W,V}\circ \tilde{\psi}(V)(1) = \tilde{\psi}(W)(1) =  \tilde{\psi} \circ res_{W,V} (1) $$ we see that $\tilde{\psi}_x \in Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{V,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{V,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) = Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x)$ induces the $\psi$ , hence proving surjectivity. Thus we indeed have $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})_x \cong Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) $$ This indicates that the isomorphism between $Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})$ and $\mathcal{F}$ ought to be of the form $$ \left(\Psi(U)\right)(\varphi)  = \left(\varphi(U)\right)(1) $$ as taking direct limits on either side results in $$ \lim_{x\in U} \left(\Psi(U)\right)(\varphi)  = \lim_{x\in U} \left(\varphi(U)\right)(1) $$ where the resulting lefthand side describes the proposed isomorphism $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_X}} (\mathcal{O}_X, \mathcal{F})_x \cong Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) $$ and the righthand side describes the canonical isomorphism $$ Hom_{Mod_{\mathcal{O}_{X,x}}} (\mathcal{O}_{X,x}, \mathcal{F}_x) \cong  \mathcal{F}_x. $$ Thus the morphism $\Psi$ induces an isomorphism of stalks and thus must be an isomorphism of sheaves. My main question is: ""Is there a more succinct way of proving the result?"" as what I came up with feels very roundabout and vague at times.","I'm working my way through The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry and want to double-check my work and thinking (and more than likely my notation) on the following question it poses: Exercise: If is an -module, then show that .
