0,Prime factorizations that yield hyperrectangles with integer diagonals,Prime factorizations that yield hyperrectangles with integer diagonals,,"I have been looking into $n$-dimensional rectangles (aka hyperrectangles ) with measures given by any orderless prime-factorization of a natural number, where the diagonal is of an integer length. Let's denote these as perfect rectangles . Obviously, every prime number yields a perfect ($1$-dimensional) rectangle. As a more generalized definition - any number whose prime-factorization is given by $\overbrace{{p}\times\dots\times{p}}^\text{N times}$ with $N$ being a square yields a perfect $N$-dimensional rectangle. For example: $81$ yields a perfect $4$-dimensional rectangle with diagonal length $\sqrt{3^2+3^2+3^2+3^2}=6$. However, there are other types of numbers that yield perfect rectangles. For example: $48$ yields a perfect $5$-dimensional rectangle with diagonal length $\sqrt{2^2+2^2+2^2+2^2+3^2}=5$. I have been searching for sequences of consecutive numbers that yield perfect rectangles. For example, $16$ and $17$ yield perfect rectangles with diagonal lengths $4$ and $17$ respectively. $2729-2730-2731$ yield perfect rectangles with diagonal lengths $2729-16-2731$ respectively. Searching up to $16$ million, I have not been able to find any sequence longer than $3$ numbers. In addition, I have noticed that in every sequence of $3$ numbers, one or two of them are prime.

1,Summing of factorials to produce perfect cubes,Summing of factorials to produce perfect cubes,,"I was playing around with factorials the other day, and I realized that $4!+5!$ is a perfect square. Perplexed by this result, I started looking for other pairs of factorials that produce a perfect square when added together (unbeknownst to me, I had stumbled across a well-known open problem in number theory). I could only find three: $1!+4!$, $1!+5!$, and $1!+7!$. Since $4!+5!$ seemed like an outlier, I decided to focus on the three which satisfy the formula $n!+1=m^2$. I turned to the main Math.SE chatroom, asking if there were any more, which is when I was informed that this is called Brocard's problem. Since it's a well-known open problem, I decided to put my own spin on it. It has probably been done before, but I can't find anything online. What about the equation $n!+1=m^3$? As far as I know, there is no pair of integers that satisfies this equation. What if the conditions are relaxed? This brings me to the following question I came up with yesterday: How many perfect cubes can be expressed as the sum of two or more unique integer factorials without subtractions, divisions, or multiplications of factorials? Notice I said unique, meaning any factorial cannot appear more than once in a sum. With that in mind, I've only found three:$$ \begin{align}&2!+3!=8=2^3\\&1!+2!+4!=27=3^3\;\;\;\Bbb{and}\\&1!+2!+3!+6!=729=9^3\,.\end{align}$$ Are there more solutions, or are these the only three? Using this link , I've concluded any additional solution must have the factorials add up to be greater than $341^3$. Since I hardly have any experience with programming, I can't go much further on this problem... Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Note: My question is NOT a duplicate of this one .

6,My (divergent) summation of the zetas with sets of cofactors give systematically errors of simple integer differences. What am I missing?,My (divergent) summation of the zetas with sets of cofactors give systematically errors of simple integer differences. What am I missing?,,"This is a ""fiddling"" in a small project of mine with which I'm concerned from time to time for three years now . I try to focus on the core of the problem, please ask if more context is needed. Consider the divergent series  $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty {(-1)^{k-1} \over k }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1 = -0.081061466...   $$ Here the symbol ""$\underset{\mathcal N}{=} $"" means, that I did that sum by the Noerlund-summation-method using 64 terms. The value which I expect by some other derivation which I'll explain below is $ -\zeta(0)' = 0.91893853 $ which differs exactly by 1. More context: the coefficients at the zetas are taken just from the matrix of Stirling-numbers of the first kind, denote them simply as $s1_{r,c}$ , so the defition stems really from: $$ \sum_{r=1}^\infty s1_{r,1} \cdot {1! \over r! }\zeta(-r) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1  $$ Next consider the divergent series taken from the next column in the Stirling matrix: $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty s1_{k,2} \cdot { 2! \over k! }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_2 = -0.006356455...   $$ The value which I expect by the other derivation is $ \zeta(0)'' = -2.00635645591... $ which differs (relatively near) by $2!$. (The difference can be made smaller by taking more terms for the Noerlund-summation) To make things short, I'm doing the dotproduct $$ Z \cdot S1 \underset{\mathcal N}{=} Y $$ where the infinite rowvector $Z$ contains the consecutive zetas $\zeta(0),\zeta(-1),\zeta(-2), ...$ and $S1$ is the matrix containing the Stirlingnumbers first kind, scaled by factorials such that $$ S1_{r,c} = s1_{r,c} \cdot { c!\over r!} $$ getting the result-vector $Y$ which deviates from my expected result of derivatives  $ \zeta(0)^{(c)}$ by factorials such that $$ Y[c]= (-1)^c \cdot (\zeta(0)^{(c)} + c!) $$ The problem is connected with that of the Ramanujan-summation of the series of like powers of logarithms: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \log(1+k)^c \underset{\mathcal Z}{=}  (-1)^c \cdot \zeta(0)^{(c)} $$ where I get (by ""$\mathcal  Z $"" eta-regularization) the ""magic constants"" having the same values as I described above and which deviate by the expected values for that sums (by the signed $\zeta(0)$-derivatives) exactly the factorials. (See my earlier question in MSE but in which I had not yet that more general view with the columns of the Stirlingmatrix) Additional remarks: the complete background can be found in this article (I'm just editing the concerning paragraphs) and was remotivated by the recent question here in MSE","This is a ""fiddling"" in a small project of mine with which I'm concerned from time to time for three years now .

The value which I expect by some other derivation which I'll explain below is $ -\zeta(0)' = 0.91893853 $ which differs exactly by 1. More context: the coefficients at the zetas are taken just from the matrix of Stirling-numbers of the first kind, denote them simply as $s1_{r,c}$ , so the defition stems really from: $$ \sum_{r=1}^\infty s1_{r,1} \cdot {1! \over r! }\zeta(-r) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_1  $$ Next consider the divergent series taken from the next column in the Stirling matrix: $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty s1_{k,2} \cdot { 2! \over k! }\zeta(-k) \underset{\mathcal N}{=} s_2 = -0.006356455...   $$ The value which I expect by the other derivation is $ \zeta(0)'' = -2.00635645591... $ which differs (relatively near) by $2!$. (The difference can be made smaller by taking more terms for the Noerlund-summation) To make things short, I'm doing the dotproduct $$ Z \cdot S1 \underset{\mathcal N}{=} Y $$ where the infinite rowvector $Z$ contains the consecutive zetas $\zeta(0),\zeta(-1),\zeta(-2), ...$ and $S1$ is the matrix containing the Stirlingnumbers first kind, scaled by factorials such that $$ S1_{r,c} = s1_{r,c} \cdot { c!\over r!} $$ getting the result-vector $Y$ which deviates from my expected result of derivatives  $ \zeta(0)^{(c)}$ by factorials such that $$ Y[c]= (-1)^c \cdot (\zeta(0)^{(c)} + c!) $$ The problem is connected with that of the Ramanujan-summation of the series of like powers of logarithms: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \log(1+k)^c \underset{\mathcal Z}{=}  (-1)^c \cdot \zeta(0)^{(c)} $$ where I get (by ""$\mathcal  Z $"" eta-regularization) the ""magic constants"" having the same values as I described above and which deviate by the expected values for that sums (by the signed $\zeta(0)$-derivatives) exactly the factorials. (See my earlier question in MSE but in which I had not yet that more general view with the columns of the Stirlingmatrix) Additional remarks: the complete background can be found in this article (I'm just editing the concerning paragraphs) and was remotivated by the recent question here in MSE",,"['number-theory', 'riemann-zeta', 'divergent-series', 'stirling-numbers', 'ramanujan-summation']"

12,2 player game subtracting perfect squares from a given number,2 player game subtracting perfect squares from a given number,,"this is my first question on these forums.  I apologize in advance if I've overlooked a rule or done something wrong.  Unfortunately, I can't remember where I came across this problem, but it's been bothering me for some time.  I'd appreciate any sort of help here. The Question: Two people, $A$ and $B$, are playing a game.  Given some number $N$, $A$ subtracts a perfect square less than or equal to $N$ from $N$.  $B$ then subtracts a perfect square less than the resulting number from that number.  And so on.  The winner is the last person to subtract a number. Determine all $N$ such that $A$ has a winning strategy. An Example: $N=13$; $A$ subtracts $1$, $B$ subtracts $9/4/1$, $A$ subtracts $1/1/9$, $B$ subtracts $1/(1 or 4)/1$, $A$ subtracts $1/(4 or 1)/1$, $B$ subtracts $-*/1/-*$, $A$ subtracts $-/1/-$, $B$ subtracts$-/-*/-$.  Since $A$ can force $B$ to lose regardless of how $B$ plays, $A$ wins. Work I've done so far: We say a number $x$ is a winning number if $A$ has a strategy for winning when $N=x$ and is a losing number if $A$ doesn't have a strategy for winning when $N=x$.  Note that if $x$ is a winning number, then there exists a perfect square $k^2$ such that $x-k^2$ is losing.  Also, if $x$ is a losing number then for any $k^2$, $x-k^2$ is a winning number.  The difference between any $2$ losing numbers can never be a perfect square.  We also note that, if $x-L$ (where $L$ is any losing number less than $x$) isn't a perfect square, then $x$ can't be a winning number.  So, using this I found a recursive means of computing some losing numbers $(0,2,5,7,10,12...)$.  The losing numbers didn't seem to have a pattern, so I figured I'd try showing that there were only a finite number and then bashing through the recursion to find them all.  But as it turns out there are infinitely many losing numbers.  I'm at a dead end here, which probably means I'm overlooking a trick of some sort. Research: I did a google search of something along the lines of ""game subtracting perfect squares"" and didn't find anything helpful.  I also checked a few of the related posts that Stack Exchange had as ""Questions that may have your answer"" and this one looked similar, but it wasn't particularly useful since parity doesn't seem to be very helpful in this problem.

52,Some questions about representation theory in the modular case,Some questions about representation theory in the modular case,,"I'm working on a paper which uses representation theory in order to compute some characters and deduce arithmetical statements about certain field extensions. Let $\Delta$ be a group of order prime to $p$, $p$ a prime number. The claim is now: The irreducible representations of $\Delta$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ of $p$ elements are in bijection with the irreducible representations of $\Delta$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The author first translates into module language and afterwards uses the properties of the $cde$-triangle (as one can find in Serre's book) as follows: He first uses Maschke's theorem to say that in our case every $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-module $N$ is projective. Then every projective $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-module $N$ has an (up to isomorphism) unique lift to a projective $\mathbb{Z}_p[\Delta]$-module $M$ for that $$N = M / pM$$ holds (Serre), what is still clear to me. Then he states, that two $\mathbb{Z}_p[\Delta]$-modules $M$ and $M'$ are isomorphic iff $M \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ and $M' \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb{Q}_p[\Delta]$-modules (Serre again).

Why absolutely irreducible? I thought a character is absolutely irreducible if it remains irreducible in an algebraic closure, but that would be $\mathbb{C}_p \otimes M$, right? The claim then follows translating back to representation language. But why should every representation of $\Delta$ over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ should have the form $M \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$? Also I was wondering if the following assertion is true: If one has a short exact sequence  $$1 \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow 1$$ of $\mathbb{F}_p[\Delta]$-modules, is it true that the irreducible character of $B$ is the sum of the irreducible characters of $A$ and $C$? Addition: What is the general point of lifting a representation over the field $\mathbb{F}_p$ to the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$? Are the latter simpler to calculate because of characteristic $0$?

Using Abel's summation formula with $a_n=r_2(n)$ , $\varphi(t)=\frac{1}{t}$ , rememebering that $R_2(x)=\sum_{n\le x}{r_2(n)}=\pi x+O(\sqrt{x})$ , we get: $$\sum_{n\le x}{\frac{r_2(n)}{n}}=\frac{R_2(x)}{x}+\int_{1}^{x}\frac{R_2(t)}{t^2}dt=$$ $$=\pi+O(x^{-1/2})+\int_{1}^{x}\left(\frac{\pi}{t}+\frac{R_2(t)-\pi t}{t^2}\right)dt=$$ $$=\pi\log(x)+\pi+O(x^{-1/2})+\int_{1}^{+\infty}\frac{R_2(t)-\pi t}{t^2}dt-\int_{x}^{+\infty}{\frac{R_2(t)-\pi t}{t^2}dt}=$$ $$=\pi\log(x)+C+O(x^{-1/2})$$ where we also used the fact that the improper integral of $\frac{R_2(t)-\pi t}{t^2}$ converges since the integrand is $O(x^{-3/2})$ , and the same estimate gives us an errore term for the integral starting from $x$ . Thus, this method provides us with a formula involving some unknown constant $C$ , which in our calculation is given by $\pi$ and the improper integral. However, we can also use the explicit formula for $r_2(n)$ to try and get the exact value of $C$ . It is well know that, if $\chi$ is the non-principal Dirichlet character modulo 4, then $r_2(n)=4\sum_{d\vert n}\chi(d)$ , so we can say that: $$\sum_{n\le x}{\frac{r_2(n)}{n}}=4\sum_{n\le x}\sum_{d\vert n}{\frac{\chi(d)}{n}}$$ If $\frac{n}{d}=m$ , we can exchange the sums and reindex them in terms of $d$ and $m$ as it follows (Dirichlet's hyperbola method): $$=4\sum_{d\le x}\sum_{m\le x/d}{\frac{\chi(d)}{dm}}=4\sum_{d\le x}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}\sum_{m\le x/d}{\frac{1}{m}}}$$ To be more careful, I decided to break the sum in two parts, when $d\le x^{1/2}$ and when $x^{1/2}<d\le x$ , such that in the first case we can estimate the second sum with the formula for $\sum_{k\le t}{\frac{1}{k}}=\log(t)+\gamma+O(\frac{1}{t})$ because $x/d\ge x^{1/2}$ so we can get a bound for the error. In the second case, we can estimate the sum in other ways to show that it is infinitesimal when $x\rightarrow +\infty$ . Precisely: $$\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}\sum_{m\le x/d}{\frac{1}{m}}}=\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}\left(\log(x)-\log(d)+\gamma+O(d/x)\right)}=$$ $$=\log(x)\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}}-\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{\chi(d)\log(d)}{d}}+\gamma\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}}+O\left(\frac{1}{x}\sum_{d\le x^{1/2}}{1}\right)$$ We now want to use the fact that $\sum_{d>t}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}}=O(\frac{1}{t})$ and $\sum_{d>t}{\frac{\chi(d)\log(d)}{d}}=O\left(\frac{\log(t)}{t}\right)$ , together with the convergence of $L(1,\chi)$ and $L'(1,\chi)$ to get: $$\log(x)\left(L(1,\chi)+O(x^{-1/2})\right)+L'(1,\chi)+O\left(\frac{\log(x)}{x^{1/2}}\right)+\gamma\left(L(1,\chi)+O(x^{-1/2})\right)+O\left(\frac{1}{x^{1/2}}\right)=$$ $$=\frac{\pi}{4}\log(x)+\frac{\gamma\pi}{4}+L'(1,\chi)+O\left(\frac{\log(x)}{x^{1/2}}\right)$$ Using the well know fact that $L(1,\chi)=\frac{\pi}{4}$ . For the other sum, notice that when $d$ is even $\chi(d)=0$ , so we only care about odd terms. If we set $d=2k+1$ , we get: $$\sum_{x^{1/2}<d\le x}{\frac{\chi(d)}{d}\sum_{m\le x/d}{\frac{1}{m}}}=\sum_{\frac{x^{1/2}-1}{2}<k\le \frac{x-1}{2}}{\frac{\chi(2k+1)}{2k+1}\sum_{m\le x/(2k+1)}{\frac{1}{m}}}=\sum_{\frac{x^{1/2}-1}{2}<k\le \frac{x-1}{2}}{\frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\sum_{m\le x/(2k+1)}{\frac{1}{m}}}$$ If we let $a_k=\frac{1}{2k+1}\sum_{m\le x/(2k+1)}{\frac{1}{m}}$ , then we have $a_k\ge 0$ for all $k$ and the sum of $(-1)^ka_k$ , an alternating sum with $a_k$ strictly decreasing. Thus, we can bound it with the absolute value of the smallest term: $$\sum_{\frac{x^{1/2}-1}{2}<k\le\frac{x-1}{2}}{(-1)^ka_k}=O\left(\frac{1}{x^{1/2}}\sum_{m\le x^{1/2}}{\frac{1}{m}}\right)=O\left(\frac{\log(x)}{x^{1/2}}\right)$$ Combining the result gotten so far, we can say that: $$\sum_{n\le x}{\frac{r_2(n)}{n}}=\pi\log(x)+\pi\gamma+4L'(1,\chi)+O\left(\frac{\log(x)}{x^{1/2}}\right)$$ It now follows that $C=\pi\gamma+4L'(1,\chi)$ , giving us also the following result: $$\int_{1}^{+\infty}{\frac{R_2(t)-\pi t}{t^2}dt}=\pi(\gamma-1)+4L'(1,\chi)$$ Thus the only thing left to compute would be $L'(1,\chi)$ .

If $a_k\equiv 0\mod 4,$ then $a_{k-1} + a_k\equiv 0\mod 4$ (as $a_{k+1}$ is even) implies $a_{k-1}\equiv 0\mod 4,$ contradicting $\gcd(a_k, a_{k-1}) = 2.$ Hence $a_k\equiv 2\mod 4,$ and so $a_{k-1}\equiv 2\mod 4.$ But from this point on, I don't know why $a_{k-1}=a_{k-2} = 2$ must hold. Once we show that $a_{k-1} = a_{k-2} = 2,$ we can then conclude the result by backwards induction ( $a_{k-j-1} =a_{k-j} = 2\Rightarrow  a_{k-j-2}=2$ ).","Find all bounded infinite sequences of positive integers with for .

The orderings on $m$ are not compatible and I haven't been able to construct a well defined map so far.

Note that I am not looking for categorical proofs regarding the isomorphism in question. I've already been through some of those. I am looking for hints on construcing explicit maps Edit after Eric Wofsey's response : We define the ring homomorphism $$\theta:\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow\underset{r}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}\ ,\ (x_m+p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z})_m\mapsto (x_{p^r}+p^r\mathbb{Z})_r$$ This is well defined by construction since $p^r|p^{r+1}$ hence by the inverse system of $\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ we have that $x_{p^{r+1}}+(p^{v_p(p^r)}=p^r)\mathbb{Z}=x_{p^r}+(p^{v_p(p^r)}=p^r)\mathbb{Z}$ which is exactly what is required for $(x_{p^r}+p^r\mathbb{Z})_r$ to be an element of $\underset{r}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$ . Now let $x:=(x_m+p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z})_m\in ker(\theta)$ then $x_{p^r}\in p^r\mathbb{Z}, \forall r\geq 1$ . Now if $p\nmid m$ , $v_p(m)=0$ hence $x_m\in p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}=\mathbb{Z}$ . If $p|m$ then $v_p(m)=r$ for some $r\geq1$ . Then since $p^r|m$ we have by the inverse system of $\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ that $x_m+p^{v_p(p^r)}\mathbb{Z}=x_{p^r}+p^{v_p(p^r)}\mathbb{Z}=0+p^r\mathbb{Z}$ Hence $x_m\in p^r\mathbb{Z}=p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ . Hence $x=0$ in $\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ , hence $\theta$ injects. Now given an element $y:=(y_r+p^r\mathbb{Z})_r\in\underset{r}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$ , we consider the element $x:=(x_m+p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z})_m\in\underset{m}\prod\mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ where $$x_m:=y_{v_p(m)},\ \text{if}\ v_p(m)\geq 1$$ $$x_m:=0,\ \text{if}\ v_p(m)=0$$ Now take $n|m$ then if $p\nmid n$ we have that $x_m+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}=x_m+\mathbb{Z}=0+\mathbb{Z}=x_n+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}$ . So assume $p|n$ hence $p|m$ which implies that $x_m=y_{v_p(m)}\ ,\ x_n=y_{v_p(n)}$ . Then by the inverse system of $\underset{r}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}$ we have that $x_m+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}=y_{v_p(m)}+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}=y_{v_p(n)}+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}=x_n+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}$ Hence indeed we have that the element $x$ belongs in $\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}$ and furthermore, it maps to $y$ under $\theta$ . Hence $\theta$ also surjects and we have an isomorphism. So overall we have shown that $$\hat{\mathbb{Z}}=\underset{n}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\underset{n}\varprojlim\ \underset{p}\prod\mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z}\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\underset{p}\prod\underset{m}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\underset{p}\prod\underset{r}\varprojlim\ \mathbb{Z}/p^r\mathbb{Z}=\underset{p}\prod\mathbb{Z}_p$$ $$\{x_n+n\mathbb{Z}\}_n\mapsto \{(x_n+p^{v_p(n)}\mathbb{Z})_p\}_n\mapsto (\{x_m+p^{v_p(m)}\mathbb{Z}\}_m)_p\mapsto (\{x_{p^r}+p^r\mathbb{Z}\}_r)_p$$ Hence we end up with the isomorphism $$\hat{\mathbb{Z}}\overset{\sim}\longrightarrow\underset{p}\prod\mathbb{Z}_p$$ $$\{x_n+n\mathbb{Z}\}_n\mapsto (\{x_{p^r}+p^r\mathbb{Z}\}_r)_p$$","I've been trying to show that the profinite completion of the integers, is isomorphic to the product over of the -adic integers.

95,About definition of the global Hecke algebra and the automorphic form,About definition of the global Hecke algebra and the automorphic form,,"Introduction I am trying to understand various definitions (which I hope them equivalent) of automorphic forms. My main problem is to describe with the global Hecke algebra rather than the group and the universal enveloping algebra. My main purpose is to understand the contents of [GJ] or [JL]. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a global field $F$ . the Global Hecke Algebra Firstly, I introduce the definition of the global Hecke algebra. There is no problem to define the global Hecke algebra as the restricted tensor product of local Hecke algebras, and there is no problem to define the local Hecke algebra for a non-Archimedean place. The problem is how to define the Archimedean parts. Let $v$ be an Archimedean place and $K_v$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G_v$ $\mathcal{H}_v(G_v,K_v)$ is defined to be the convolution algebra of distributions of $G_v$ supported on $K_v$ ([Ge] Def.3.6), and with additionally the $K_v$ -finiteness condition. (one can show left finiteness $\Leftrightarrow$ right finiteness) ([Bu] p311, ""by Flath"") I notice that to be connected with the universal enveloping algebra one need the following structure theorem: $\mathcal{H}(G_v,K_v)\simeq \mathcal{H}(K_v)\otimes_{U(\mathfrak{k}_\mathbb{C})}U(\mathfrak{g}_\mathbb{C})$ . ([Ge] p28, 5.4; [Bu] p311; [KV] p71, Cor.1.71) Remark: I think the $K_v$ -finiteness condition is necessary. My question is: is this definition which we use most? the Automorphic Forms Secondly, (assume the definition of the global Hecke algebra is correct) I am now give some definitions of automorphic forms on $G(\mathbb{A})$ from different books. Let $\phi: G(\mathbb{A}) \to \mathbb{C}$ be a complex valued function on $G(\mathbb{A})$ , and $\omega: F^\times\backslash\mathbb{A}^\times\to U(1)$ a fixed unitary idelic character. We introduce the following conditions: (LI): (left invirance) $\phi(\gamma g)=\phi(g)$ for all $\gamma \in G(F)$ and $g \in G(\mathbb{A})$ . (CC): (central unitary character) $\phi(ag)=\omega(a)\phi(g)$ for all $a \in Z(G(\mathbb{A}))$ and $g \in G(\mathbb{A})$ . (SM): (smoothness) $\phi$ is smooth. (GC): (growth condition) If $F$ is a number field then $\phi$ is of moderate growth/ slowly increasing. (KF): ( $K$ -finiteness) $\phi$ is right $K-$ finite. Above are the common conditions of different versions. (ZF): ( $\mathcal{Z}-$ finiteness) $\phi$ is $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}})-$ finite. (AD): (admissibility) The $\mathcal{H}-$ space $V$ which is the $\mathcal{H}-$ spanning of $\phi$ is admissible, i.e., for any elementary idempotent element $\xi$ in $\mathcal{H}$ , $\xi V$ is finite dimensional. (ND): (non-degeneration) There is an elementary idempotent element $\xi$ in $\mathcal{H}$ , $\xi\phi=\phi$ . (IZ): (ideal of $\mathcal{Z}$ ) This is a (finite-codimensional [?]) ideal of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{C}})$ that annihilates $\phi$ . Then I give three version of additional conditions for automorphic forms: Version 1:  (ZF).  ([GF] Def.4.7.6; [Bu] p299) Version 2: (AD). ([GJ] p145-146; [JL] Def.10.2) Version 3: (ND) + (IZ).

My main interest is to show Version 2 is equivalent to Version 1, and to show Version 2 implies (ND) (since it is a very useful condition). However I am really not familiar with the Archimedean case and also I am a little worried when seeing such many different but expectedly equivalent definitions.

My attempt: We can see immediately that $x=y=z=0$ is a solution. By taking mod $3$ we have: $$y^4 \equiv 2^z \text{ (mod 3)}$$ But we already know that $y^4 \equiv 0 \text{ or } 1 \text{ (mod 3)}$ and $2^z$ is not divisible by $3$ , therefore $2^z \equiv 1 \text{ (mod 3)}$ , so $z$ is even. Let $z=2t$ , we then subtract $y^4$ from both sides to get $$12^x = \left( 56^t-y^2 \right) \left( 56^t+y^2 \right)$$ So we have $56^t-y^2= 2^a3^b$ and $56^t+y^2 = 2^{2x-a}3^{x-b}$ for some non-negative intgers $a,b$ . But since $\left( 56^t-y^2 \right) + \left( 56^t+y^2 \right)$ is not divisible by $3$ , only one of the two terms is divisible by $3$ , which means $b = 0 \text{ or } b=x$ . This is where I got stuck, I don't know what to do next. Am I going the wrong direction? Please help me.","I need help to solve the following Diophantine equation: where are non-negative integers.

99,For which values of $n$ Shakur has a winning strategy?,For which values of  Shakur has a winning strategy?,n,"Problem: Shakur and Tiham are playing a game. Initially, Shakur picks a positive integer not greater than $1000$ . Then Tiham picks a positive integer smaller than that. Then they keep on doing this taking turns to pick progressively smaller and smaller positive integers until someone picks $1$ . After that, all the numbers that have been picked so far are added up. The person picking the number $1$ wins if and only if this sum is a perfect square. Otherwise, the other player wins. If Shakur starts with the number $n$ , find all values of $n$ for which he has a winning strategy. The problem is from a national olympiad. Here is my progress in solving the problem: I first checked the small cases. For $n=1$ , Shakur has a winning strategy. For $n=2$ , Tiham must pick $1$ . But $3$ is not a perfect square. So, Shakur has a winning strategy in this case. For $n=3$ , Tiham can pick $2$ . Then, Shakur picks $1$ . But $6$ is not a perfect square. So, Tiham wins in this case. Then I noticed that $n$ must be $3$ less than a perfect square when $n>2$ . Because Tiham can pick $2$ after Shakur picks $n$ and then Shakur must pick $1$ . So, Shakur can't have a winning strategy unless $n+3$ is a perfect square.
