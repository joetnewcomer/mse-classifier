46,How does one construct general forms that certain variables in an equation must take?,How does one construct general forms that certain variables in an equation must take?,,"Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of the greatest mathematicians of all time $-$ the greatest in the $20^\text{th}$ century. One day, he stumbled across the equation $$\rm3^3+4^3+5^3=6^3\tag1$$ and only days later, he was able to discover the general form that this equation takes place in: $$\big(3a^2+5ab-5b^2\big)^3+\big(4a^2-4ab+6b^2\big)^3+\big(5a^2-5ab-3b^2\big)^3=\big(6a^2-4ab+4b^2\big)^3\tag2$$ for all integers $a$ and $b$, with Eq. $(1)$ being created when $a=1$ and $b=0$. Now I know that barely anyone knows how Ramanujan obtained his results $-$ but he did, and they are brilliant. My question is, are there any useful techniques or methods that I can learn so I may be able to pull something like finding Eq. $(2)$? What algorithms are there to discover some general equations? I was not convinced when I looked at it, so I evaluated, and the left hand side weighs the same as the right hand side. But are there any such algorithms at all? For example, $a^2-b^2$ looks like some regular expression, but just add in the clever substitution $ab - ab$ and then this happens: $$\begin{align}a^2-b^2&=a^2+ab-ab-b^2\\ &= a(a+b)-b(a+b) \\ &= (a+b)(a-b).\end{align}$$ So now when anybody says what $915^2-914^2$ is, I can say it right away: it is $915+914=1829$. How does anybody know to put such clever substitutions? When I was first given the problem to factorise $a^2-b^2$, I just did this: $$\begin{align}(a-b)^2&=a^2-2ab+b^2 \\ \Leftrightarrow a^2-b^2&=(a-b)^2 + 2ab - 2b^2 \\ &= (a-b)^2 + 2b(a-b) \\ &= (a-b)(a-b+2b) \\ &= (a+b)(a-b).\end{align}$$ I got the same result, but it was not as efficient as the first method. I want to become a great mathematician one day; I don't want to just tell my friends that I do math for a living $-$ I want to prove something, or make a theorem, especially if it involves prime numbers. What are some helpful algebraic formulae that I should know when it comes to constructing generalised equations and such? I know the quadratic and cubic formula... but that is it.

A sketch of why this is true : If $k$ is even, this is very easy to see as the Legendre symbol goes away, so we are summing the $p^k$th roots of unity. If $k$ is odd, the way I see it is a bit less obvious: reduce the Legendre symbol to be $\left( \frac{n}{p} \right)$ so that it's $p$-periodic, write $n = pn' + n''$ fpr $0 \leq n' < p^{k-1}$ and $0 \leq n'' \leq p$.

Progress: We use induction on $n.$ For $n=1$ it works. Say it works for $n-1$ . We will show for $n$ . Note that $2^na-9$ is $$2^{n-1}2a-9.$$ If we have infinite $a$ such that $a$ is even for $n-1$ , then we are done. Else, only finite amounts of $a$ are even. So after a large constant $N$ , we have $2^{n-1}a-9=x^3$ for only odd $a$ . So say $$2^{n-1}a_1-2^{n-1}a_2=u^3-w^3\implies 2^{n-1}|u^3-w^3$$ But I couldn't get anything further. I thought about taking $v_2$ , as in, if $2^na=x^3+9$ then we can take $x=y^2$ . So we have $$2^na=y^2+3^2.$$","Show that for any , there are infinitely many cubes of the form .
