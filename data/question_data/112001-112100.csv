I came across this question while solving the book on Abstract algebra by Pinter. My approach to this problem was :- consider two elements $p$ and $q$ in the set H. Then $(px)^2 = (xp)^2$ for every $x$ in G . And  $(qx)^2 = (xq)^2$ for all $x$ in G . from this I was trying to show that $(pqx)^2 = (xpq)^2$ for all $x$ in G . By which we can show that pq is also part of H. And thus H is closed with respect to products. (That H is closed with respect to inverses also needs to be proven but I am stuck in the first stage itself) This approach worked in a previous problem where one had to show that center of a group is a subgroup. There the property of elements in the set C (the center) was  $ax = xa$ for all $x$ in G . The lack of square term made it easy to prove. So I thought maybe I shouldn't use the same approach. And hence I tried using $x^{-1}$ instead of $x$ in the equation for the element $q$  along with the equation for p. But that is also not working out. If G was Abelian proving this would have been very easy. But it is not given so. Hence I am stuck.

40,Classification of Groups of Order $p^2$,Classification of Groups of Order,p^2,"The book I am reading contains contains the following claim: Every group of order $p^2$, where $p$ is a prime, is isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_{p^2}$ or $\mathbf{Z}_p \oplus \mathbf{Z}_p$. I tried to do the proof myself and ended up with the following. Is the following sketch correct? -- We can show all groups of order $p^2$ are abelian by examining the center of the group. https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Group_of_Order_Prime_Squared_is_Abelian We are left to show, that such an abelian group of order $p^2$ is of the two forms given above. Examine arbitrary subgroup $\langle a \rangle \subset G$. By lagrange's theorem it's order can be $p^2$, $p$, or $1$. If $|\langle a \rangle|=p^2$ we obtain an abelian subgroup order $p^2$ -- i.e. $\langle a \rangle$ generates G. So $\mathbf{Z}_{p^2} = \langle a \rangle = G$ (the first isomorphism established by sending $k \mapsto a^k$). If $|\langle a \rangle|=p$ we have an abelian subgroup of $G$ order of $p$. We can see $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = \langle a \rangle$ by again sending $k \mapsto a^k$.  Construct $G/\langle a \rangle$ (Can check $\langle a \rangle$ is normal in $G$). $|G/\langle a \rangle| = p$ by using coset definition and counting. By using Lagrange's theorem, one can show any group of order $p$ is cyclic and abelian. Thus we can construct the isomorphism: $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = G/\langle a \rangle$. We note: $\langle a \rangle = \mathbf{Z}_{p} = G/\langle a \rangle$. And so: $G/\langle a \rangle \oplus \langle a \rangle=\mathbf{Z}_p \oplus \mathbf{Z}_p$. ( How do I show $G/\langle a \rangle \oplus \langle a \rangle$ = $G$? I think this is still missing ) If $|\langle a \rangle|=1$ then $G/\langle a \rangle =G$.

I tried to do the proof myself and ended up with the following. Is the following sketch correct? -- We can show all groups of order $p^2$ are abelian by examining the center of the group. https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Group_of_Order_Prime_Squared_is_Abelian We are left to show, that such an abelian group of order $p^2$ is of the two forms given above. Examine arbitrary subgroup $\langle a \rangle \subset G$. By lagrange's theorem it's order can be $p^2$, $p$, or $1$. If $|\langle a \rangle|=p^2$ we obtain an abelian subgroup order $p^2$ -- i.e. $\langle a \rangle$ generates G. So $\mathbf{Z}_{p^2} = \langle a \rangle = G$ (the first isomorphism established by sending $k \mapsto a^k$). If $|\langle a \rangle|=p$ we have an abelian subgroup of $G$ order of $p$. We can see $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = \langle a \rangle$ by again sending $k \mapsto a^k$.  Construct $G/\langle a \rangle$ (Can check $\langle a \rangle$ is normal in $G$). $|G/\langle a \rangle| = p$ by using coset definition and counting. By using Lagrange's theorem, one can show any group of order $p$ is cyclic and abelian. Thus we can construct the isomorphism: $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = G/\langle a \rangle$. We note: $\langle a \rangle = \mathbf{Z}_{p} = G/\langle a \rangle$. And so: $G/\langle a \rangle \oplus \langle a \rangle=\mathbf{Z}_p \oplus \mathbf{Z}_p$.

80,Group theoretic meaning of natural isomorphisms between certain functors,Group theoretic meaning of natural isomorphisms between certain functors,,"So imagine you have a group $G$ and we consider the set of group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}$ to  $G$ specified by  $\forall g$ $\in G$ $\exists$   $\phi(1)=g$.

Consider groups for a moment in the context of category theory, viewing the groups as one object categories and thereof group homomorphism as functors. What would a natural isomorphism mean in group theory terms for G? My thoughts are that the natural transformations equate to maps between homomorphisms and since the homomorphisms are in 1-1 relation with the elements of G, then a natural transformation is a map between group elements, i.e another element of the group. I'm not entirely convinced by this.
