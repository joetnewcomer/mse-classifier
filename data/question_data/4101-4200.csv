0,Chebyshev's Theorem regarding real polynomials: Why do only the Chebyshev polynomials achieve equality in this inequality?,Chebyshev's Theorem regarding real polynomials: Why do only the Chebyshev polynomials achieve equality in this inequality?,,In the book Proofs from The Book by Aigner and Ziegler there is a proof of 'Chebyshev's Theorem' which states that if $p(x)$ is a real polynomial of degree n with leading coefficient $1$ then $$ \max_{-1 \leq x \leq 1} |p(x)| \geq \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$$ In the proof $g( \theta ) = p( \cos \theta )$ is written as a cosine polynomial $ \sum_{k=0}^n \lambda_k \cos(k \theta)$ and it is then proved that this can't be less than $|\lambda_n|$ (which happens to be $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$) everywhere. Afterwards it is claimed that 'The reader can easily complete the analysis' to show that the Chebyshev polynomials are the only ones for which equality occurs in the above inequality. I haven't been able to figure this out. Can someone explain why this is true?

Let's start by setting $A = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $B = \frac{3\pi}{2}$ . It follows from basic trigonometry that: \begin{align} &\cos x \geq 0, \ x \in [A,B] \ \text{and}\\ &\cos x \leq 0, \ x \in [0, A] \cap [B, 2\pi]. \end{align} And we also set $L$ to be the line segment such that $L(A) = f(A), \ L(B) = f(B)$ . We will prove a basic property of said line in regards to the convex function $f$ . I can take for granted that (we proved this in class) \begin{align} L(x) = \dfrac{x-A}{B-A}f(B) + \dfrac{B-x}{B-A}f(A) \end{align} so for $x \in [A,B]$ there exists $\lambda \in [0,1]$ such that: $x = \lambda A + (1-\lambda) B$ . Taking the aforementioned expression and replacing it on $L(x)$ we get (I omit trivial algebra) \begin{align} L(x) = (1-\lambda) f(B) + \lambda f(A). \end{align} Since $f$ is convex, we can write \begin{align} &f(\lambda A + (1-\lambda) B) \leq \lambda f(A) + (1-\lambda) f(B)\\ \implies &f(x) \leq L(x), \ \forall \ x \in [A,B] \ \text{and} \ \lambda \in [0,1]. \end{align} $\blacksquare$ We assume that there exists $x \in [0,A]: \ f(x) < L(x)$ . Then there exists $A \in [x, B] \ \text{and} \ \lambda \in [0,1]: \ A = \lambda x + (1-\lambda) B$ . Then \begin{align} &L(A) = \dfrac{A-x}{B-x}f(B) + \dfrac{B-A}{B-x}f(x), \ A \in [x,B]\\ \implies &L(A) = (1-\lambda)L(B)+\lambda L(x)\\ \implies &L(A) = (1-\lambda)f(B) + \lambda L(x). \end{align} Then assuming that $L(x) > f(x)$ we get \begin{align} L(A) > (1-\lambda) f(B) + \lambda f(x) \geq f(A), \ \text{assuming convexity}. \end{align} Because $L(A) = f(A)$ the above inequality becomes $L(A) > f(A)$ which is a contradiction. $\blacksquare$ In the same spirit, for $x \in [B, 2\pi]$ doing the exact same replacements and applying the exact same principles we also get \begin{align} &f(\lambda B + (1-\lambda) 2 \pi) \leq \lambda f(B) + (1-\lambda) f(2\pi)\\ \implies &f(x) \leq L(x). \end{align} $\blacksquare$ We then set $g(x) = f(x) - L(x)$ and from (1) and (2) above it is safe to assume that $\cos x$ and $g(x)$ will have the same sign in the whole domain, that is: \begin{align} &g(x) \geq 0, \ \text{where} \ \cos x \geq 0\\ &g(x) \leq 0, \ \text{where} \ \cos x \geq 0. \end{align} We have \begin{align} \int_0^{2\pi} g(x) \cos x dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} g(x) \cos x dx + \int_{\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{3 \pi}{2}} g(x) \cos x dx + \int_{\frac{3\pi}{2}}^{2\pi}g(x) \cos x dx \geq 0, \end{align} because \begin{align} &\text{in} \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2} \right], \ \cos x \geq 0 \implies g(x) \geq 0\\ &\text{in} \left[\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3 \pi}{2} \right], \ \cos x \leq 0 \implies g(x) \leq 0\\ &\text{in} \left[\frac{3 \pi}{2}, 2 \pi \right], \ \cos x \geq 0 \implies g(x) \geq 0.\\ \end{align} We have that \begin{align} &\int_0^{2 \pi}\cos x dx = 0 \ \text{trivial}\\ &\int_0^{2 \pi}x \cos x dx = \int_0^{2 \pi}x (\sin x)' dx = \left[ x \sin x \right]_0^{2\pi} - \int_0^{2 \pi} \sin x dx = 0. \end{align} It then follows that \begin{align} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(x) \cos x dx = \int_0^{2 \pi} g(x) \cos x dx \geq 0 \end{align} which was previously proven. For the case $k=1$ , the proof is over. For $k>1$ , we have: \begin{align} \int_0^{2\pi}f(x) \cos (kx) dx = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \int_{\frac{2\pi i}{k}}^{\frac{2\pi (i+1)}{k}} f(x) \cos (kx) dx. \end{align} We perform the change of variable \begin{align} x = \dfrac{y+2\pi i}{k}\\ \implies \begin{cases}dx = \dfrac{1}{k}dy\\ x = \dfrac{2\pi i}{k} \to y=0\\ x = \dfrac{2\pi (i+1)}{k} \to y = 2\pi \end{cases}. \end{align} So the above sum becomes \begin{align} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \dfrac{1}{k} \int_{0}^{2\pi}f \left(\dfrac{y+2 \pi i}{k} \right) \cos (y+2\pi i)dy. \end{align} Because $f$ is convex in $[0, 2\pi]$ there exists $\lambda \in [0,1]$ such that: \begin{align} 	\theta f\left(\frac{y_1 + 2\pi i}{k}\right) 	+ (1 - \theta)f\left(\frac{y_2 + 2\pi i}{k}\right) 	&\ge f\left(\theta\frac{y_1 + 2\pi i}{k} 	+ (1 - \theta) \frac{y_2 + 2\pi i}{k}\right)\\ 	&= f\left(\frac{\theta y_1 + (1 - \theta)y_2 + 2\pi i}{k}\right). \end{align} Having performed the change of variables: \begin{align} x_1 = \dfrac{y_1 + 2\pi i}{k} \ \text{and} \ x_2 = \dfrac{y_2 + 2\pi i}{k}. \end{align} So $f \left( \dfrac{y + 2\pi i}{k}\right)$ convex on $[0, 2\pi]$ . Using the result from $k=1$ we have \begin{align} \int_0^{2\pi} f \left( \dfrac{y + 2\pi i}{k} \right)\cos y dy \geq 0. \end{align} $\blacksquare$","Given convex function, prove that for every I am completely stumped.

Let's suppose that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n$ are convergent, so since they are composed of positive and negative terms respectively, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |b_n| < \infty$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty |c_n| <\infty$ and we have that $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n| = \sum_{n=1}^\infty |b_n| + \sum_{n=1}^\infty |c_n| < \infty $$ which is absurd since we supposed that the series was conditionally convergent. Edit Can I define $b_n := \left\{\begin{array}{ll} a_n &\text{if } a_n > 0 \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.$ and $c_n$ analogously for negative terms and say that $\sum a_n = \sum b_n + \sum c_n $ and, since $\sum a_n$ converges then both $\sum b_n, \sum c_n$ converge? Are the new series equal to the series of positive (and negative) terms? Is this correct? Thanks in advance",,"['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence']"

A set $E\subset X$ is called locally measurable if $E\cap A\in M$ for all $A\in M$ such that $\mu(A) < \infty$. Let $\tilde{M}$ be the collection of all locally measurable sets. Clearly, $M\subset \tilde{M}$, if $M = \tilde{M}$, then $\mu$ is saturated. a.) If $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then $\mu$ is saturated. Proof - Suppose $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite. Let $A\in\tilde{M}$, and let $X = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j$ where $E_j\in M$ and $\mu(E_j) < \infty$ for all $j$. We know $M\subset \tilde{M}$ what we want to show is that $\tilde{M}\subset M$. We can write $$A = A\cap X = A\cap \left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right) = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\cap A$$ Since $\mu(E_j)<\infty$ we have $E_j\cap A\in M$ for all $j$. Therefore, $\tilde{M}\subset M$, thus $\mu$ is saturated. b.) $\tilde{M}$ is $\sigma$-algebra. Proof - i.) $\emptyset\in M\subset \tilde{M}$, so $\emptyset\in \tilde{M}$. ii.) Let $B\in \tilde{M}$. Take any $E\in M$ such that $\mu(E) < \infty$. Then $$E\setminus B = E\cap B^c = E\cap (E\cap B)^c$$ since $E\in M$ and $(E\cap B)\in M$ then $(E\cap (E\cap B)^c\in M$. Thus we have $B^c\in \tilde{M}$. iii.) Let $\{B_j\}_{1}^{\infty}\in \tilde{M}$. Take any $E\in M$ with $\mu(E)< \infty$. Then, $$\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}B_j\right)\cap E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}(B_j\cap E)\in M$$  so, by definition of $\tilde{M}$, $\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}B_j\in \tilde{M}$. Therefore $\tilde{M}$ us a $\sigma$-algebra. c.) Define $\tilde{\mu}$ on $\tilde{M}$ by $\tilde{\mu}(E) = \mu(E)$ if $E\in M$ and $\tilde{\mu}(E) = \infty$ otherwise. Then $\tilde{\mu}$ is a saturated measure on $\tilde{M}$, called the saturation of $\mu$. Step 1: Show that $\tilde{\mu}$ is a measure on $\tilde{M}$. Proof - i.) $\tilde{\mu}(\emptyset) = \mu(\emptyset) = 0$. ii.) Let $\{E_j\}_{1}^{\infty}\in \tilde{M}$ that is pairwise disjoint. Let $$E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j$$ If $E \in M$ then \begin{align*} \tilde{\mu}(E) = \tilde{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right) &= \mu\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu(E_j)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\tilde{\mu}(E_j) \end{align*} If $E\notin M$ then $\tilde{\mu}(E) = \infty$... not sure where to go from here. Step 2 - $\tilde{\mu}$ is saturated. Proof - Let $E\subset X$ such that $E\cap A\in \tilde{M}$ when $\tilde{\mu}(A) < \infty$. Choose a $B\in M$ such that $\mu(B)<\infty$. Then, clearly $\tilde{\mu}(B)<\infty$ and $E\cap B\in \tilde{M}$. So, $E\cap B = (E\cap B)\cap B\in M$ so $E\in \tilde{M}$ it thus follows that $\tilde{\mu}$ is saturated. d.) If $\mu$ is complete, so is $\tilde{\mu}$. Proof - Suppose $\mu$ is complete. Let $A\subset X$ and suppose there is a $B\in \tilde{M}$ such that $A\subset B$ and $\mu(B) = 0$. Since $B\in\tilde{M}$ and $\mu(B) = 0$ then $\tilde{\mu}(B) < \infty$ and hence $B\in M$. This, since $A\subset B$ we have $A\in M$ by completeness of $\mu$. Therefore, $A\in \tilde{M}$ and $\tilde{\mu}$ is complete. e.) Suppose that $\mu$ is semifinite. For $E\in\tilde{M}$, define $\underline{\mu}(E) = \sup\{\mu(A):A\in M, A\subset E\}$. Then $\underline{\mu}$ is a saturated measure on $\tilde{M}$ that extends $\mu$. Step 1 - $\underline{\mu}$ is a measure. Proof - i.) $\overline{\mu}(\emptyset) = \mu(\emptyset) = 0$ ii.) Let $\{E_j\}_{1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of disjoint sets in $\tilde{M}$. Set, $$E = \bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j$$ then by definition of $\tilde{M}$ there is an $A\in M$ and $A\subset E$. Case 1 - $\mu(A) < \infty$. Then $$\mu(A) = \mu\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\cap A\right) = \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu(E_j\cap A)\leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j)$$ Case 2 - $\mu(A) = \infty$. By semifiniteness, for all $C>0$ there exists a $F\subset A$ such that $F\in M$ and $\mu(F) = C$. Then by case 1, $\leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j) = \infty$. Therefore, $\mu(A) \leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j)$. Taking the supremum over all $A$ we have $$\underline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right)\leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j)$$ Now we need to show the reverse inequality. By the definition of supremum there exists a sequence $\{B_i\}_{1}^{\infty}\in M$ and $B_i\subset E_i$ for all $i$. Thus, $\underline{\mu}(E_i)\leq \mu(B_i) + \epsilon 2^{-i}$. Therefore,  \begin{align*} \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_i) &\leq \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu(B_i) + \epsilon\\ &= \mu\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}B_i\right) + \epsilon \ \ \text{is this true because of case 1?}\\ &\leq \underline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_i\right) + \epsilon \end{align*} Since this holds for all $\epsilon > 0$, we have $$\sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j)\leq \underline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right)$$ Therefore, $$\underline{\mu}\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right) = \sum_{1}^{\infty}\underline{\mu}(E_j)$$ and hence $\underline{\mu}$ is a measure.

Then $\underline{\mu}(B) < \infty$ so $E\cap B\in \tilde{M}$. Thus, $E\cap B = (E\cap B)\cap B\in M$ and $E\in\tilde{M}$, hence, $\underline{\mu}$ is saturated. Step 3 - $\underline{\mu}$ is an extention of $\mu$. Proof - Let $E\in M$. For any $A\in M$ such that $A\subset E$, we have by monotonicity that $\mu(A)\leq \mu(E)$. Since $\underline{\mu}(E)$ is the supremum over all such $A$, we must have that $\underline{\mu}(E)\leq \mu(E)$. OTOH.... not sure how to show the reverse inequality. f.) Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be disjoint uncountable sets, $X = X_1\cup X_2$, and $M$ the $\sigma$-alegbra of countable or co-countable sets in $X$. Let $\mu_0$ be counting measure on $\mathcal{P}(X_1)$ and define $\mu$ on $M$ by $\mu(E) = \mu_0(E\cap X_1)$. Then $\mu$ is a measure on $M$, $\tilde{M} = \mathcal{P}(X)$, and in the notation of parts (c) and (e), $\tilde{\mu}\neq \underline{\mu}$. Step 1 - $\mu$ is a measure on $M$. Proof - i.) $\mu(\emptyset) = \mu_0(\emptyset\cap X_1) = 0$ ii.) Let $\{E_j\}_{1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of disjoint sets in $M$, then  \begin{align*} \mu\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\right) &= \mu_0\left(\bigcup_{1}^{\infty}E_j\cap X_1\right)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu_0(E_j\cap X_1)\\ &= \sum_{1}^{\infty}\mu(E_j) \ \ \ \text{is this true because} \ \mu_0 \ \text{is a counting measure?} \end{align*} Therefore $\mu$ is a measure on $M$. Step 2 - $\tilde{M} = \mathcal{P}(X)$ Proof - Step 3 - $\tilde{\mu}\neq \underline{\mu}$ Proof - Take $y_1,y_2\in X_1$. Let $E = \{y_1,y_2\}\cup X_2$. Then $E\notin M$, so $\tilde{\mu}(E) = \infty$. However, $\underline{\mu}(E) = 2$. I will re-edit my question and include these other proofs as I continue to do them. I am pretty sure my proof for $\tilde{\mu}$ is a measure is incorrect. But I am not really sure how to do it. Any suggestions on any of these is greatly appreciated.","Exercise 16 - Let $(X,M,\mu)$ be a measure space.

Step 2 - $\tilde{M} = \mathcal{P}(X)$ Proof - Step 3 - $\tilde{\mu}\neq \underline{\mu}$ Proof - Take $y_1,y_2\in X_1$. Let $E = \{y_1,y_2\}\cup X_2$. Then $E\notin M$, so $\tilde{\mu}(E) = \infty$. However, $\underline{\mu}(E) = 2$. I will re-edit my question and include these other proofs as I continue to do them. I am pretty sure my proof for $\tilde{\mu}$ is a measure is incorrect. But I am not really sure how to do it. Any suggestions on any of these is greatly appreciated.",,"['real-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'proof-verification']"

Suppose that $f: \mathbb{R^+}\to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $\lim_{x\to \infty} (f+f')(x)=0$. Show that $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)=0$. This is one solution I found to this problem. Solution: If $x=a$ is in the domain of the function $f$, then by the generalized mean value theorem applied to the functions $e^x f(x)$ and $e^x$, there exists $c\in (a,x)$ such that $\frac{e^x f(x)-e^a f(a)}{e^x -e^a}=\frac{e^c f'(c)+e^c f(c)}{e^c}.$ This yields $\frac{e^x}{e^x -e^a} f(x)-\frac{e^a}{e^x - e^a}f(a)=f'(c)+f(c)$. Taking limits as $c$ tends to infinity we have,  $\lim_{c\to \infty}\frac{e^x}{e^x -e^a} \lim_{c\to \infty}f(x)-\lim_{c\to \infty}\frac{e^a}{e^x - e^a}\lim_{c\to \infty}f(a)=\lim_{c\to \infty}[f'(c)+f(c)]$. But $c\lt x$, thus we obtain $1 \cdot \lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)-0\cdot f(a)=\lim_{c\to \infty}[f'(c)+f(c)].$ Hence, since the right hand side is equal to $0$, it follows that $\lim_{x\to \infty}f(x)=0.$ Taking a close look at this solution, however, I think it may not be correct since the $c$ used in the answer is actually a function of $x$ and it may not make sense to take $c\to \infty$. I mean how do we know that there will always be such a $c$ greater than any given positive number? Is this solution correct? If so, how can my question be answered?
