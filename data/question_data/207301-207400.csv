I know the following about the vectors $x_i \in B$: (i) $|x_i| \in [1,n-1]$ for all $x_i \in B$ ( at least 1 zero coordinate, and one non-zero coordinate) (ii) $d(x_i, x_j) \geq 1$ for all $x_i, x_j \in B$ ( all vectors are distinct ) (iii) $d(x_i, x_j) \leq r$ for all $x_i, x_j \in B$ (*all vectors differ by at most $r$ coordinates) Here, $d(x_i, x_j) = |x_i - x_j| = \sum_{k=1}^{k=n} 1[x_{i,k} \neq x_{j,k}]$.

Use an algorithm to compute the minimum number of coins needed to make change for 42 on Venus. State which coins are used to satisfy this minimum I used Dynamic Programming as the algorithm used to solve this problem. Here my work 1 coin to make 6   2 coins to make 12 (+6)   3 coins to make 13 (+1)   4 coins to make 32 (+19)   5 coins to make 42 (+10) So my answer would be the minimum number of coins needed to make change for 42 on Venus would be 5 and the coins to satisfy this minimum are {6, 6, 1, 19, 10} Does everyone agree with my answer(5) and my arrangement of coins to satisfy the minimum 5 or is there a better answer?",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'computer-science', 'recursion', 'recursive-algorithms', 'dynamic-programming']"
