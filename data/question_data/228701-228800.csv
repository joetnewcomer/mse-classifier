From the discussion in the comments there, it seems there does not exist a set of all sets of a given cardinality. To me, it seems easy to see that this is true for any nonzero finite cardinality $n$. Given any set $x$, you can always make a set of size $n$ by adding $n-1$ other sets to $x$ to make a set of size $n$, which exists by repeated use of the pairing axiom. But how would you do this for infinite cardinalities? For suppose $\kappa$ is some given infinite cardinality. To show that the set of all sets of cardinality $\kappa$ does not exist, it seems you would have to show that for any set $x$, there exists a set of that size with $x$ as an element, and then you could take the union of that set to find the set of all sets, and thus a contradiction.

I am stuck at proving that there are $a_i, a_j \in A $ such that $a_n \notin (a_i,a_j ) $for any $a_n \in A$. The problem is that this does not hold for any choice of $a_i$. For example, if $A= \{0\} \cup \{ 1/n \}$, then obviously for $0 $ this does not hold, although it holds for any other element. Is there any easy and fast way to get past this?",,['elementary-set-theory']
21,Proof that the reals are uncountable by Königsberger,Proof that the reals are uncountable by Königsberger,,"I found this proof in Chapter 2 (Satz 7) of ""Analysis 1"" by Königsberger (hope it is not a duplicate) It begins by defining an ""Intervallschachtelung"" (I don't know any good translation), which is a sequence $I_1,I_2,...$ of closed intervals (in the real line) such that: $I_{n+1}\subset I_n$ for every $n\in\Bbb N$ For every $\epsilon\gt0$ there is one intervall $I_n$ with length $\vert I_n\vert\lt\epsilon$ The book gives the next as a principle: For every Intervallschachtelung in $\Bbb R$ there is a real number that belongs to every interval (Intervallschachtelungprinzip) Now the proof: Let $\Bbb R=\{x_1,x_2,...\}$ be the countable set of every real number. Now we construct an Intervallschachtelung $(I_n)$ such that $$x_n\notin I_n$$ beginning by setting $I_1=[x_1+1,x_1+2]$ and getting $I_{n+1}$ from $I_n$ by recursion: divide $I_n$ in three equal parts and choose $I_{n+1}$ to be the one that doesn´t contain $x_{n+1}$. $(I_n)$ is an Intervallschachtelung and therefore there is a number $s\in I_n$ for every $n\in\Bbb N$ but if $s$ had been some $x_k$ in $\Bbb R$, then $x_k=s\in I_k$ which is a contradiction and thus $\Bbb R$ is uncountable Now my question: isn't this the same as Cantor's diagonal argument?

Some years ago I was quite excited to find that the set $\mathcal{P}(N)$ of all $2^n$ subsets of an $n$-element set $N$ forms a abelian group under the $\triangle$-operation. Being older and wiser it is easy to see where this group comes from: replacing every subset $A$ of $N$ with its indicator function, that is: by a vector of $n$ zeroes and ones indicating whether or not the first element of $N$ is in $A$, whether or not the second element is etc, we see that taking the symmetric difference of sets corresponds to adding the indicator vectors mod 2. In other words: the group we find is the underlying abelian group of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Now for the question. $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is more commonly written $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ and the reason is that on top of being a vector space it is also a field. In other words: there is a, really beautiful, way of mutliplying these vectors. The question then is: what does this multiplication look like when described in terms of sets? Starting from the 'abstract' field $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ there seem to be many ways and a lot of arbitrary choices involved when picking a way to write the elements as vectors, but perhaps, starting from sets with symmetric differences as addition there is a 'most beautiful way' to add multiplication to the picture? What we want is a second operations on subsets of $N$ that distributes over $\triangle$ and of course an example is not hard to find: intersection will do. But looking at the vector picture again we that this gives the stupid pointwise multiplication of vectors. This is definitely not the field multiplication as it produces zero (the empty set) whenever we try to 'multiply' two disjoint subsets. So my question is: what 'even more' beautiful set operation corresponds to the multiplication in $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ when letting it act on all subsets of a set of $n$ elements? EDIT: as requested in the comments I will say something about the small cases. First for $n = 1$ we note that in this very small case pointwise and field multiplication coincide, so we can use the intersection. Thinking about intersections we note that (if nothing else) the idea of taking the field element 1 to be the full set $N$ might be something to take with us from this example to the larger cases with fancier set operations. After all, 1 is the only element besides 0 we know that is present and easily recognizable in every field, and similarly the full set is the only subset besides the empty set which is equally easy to identify in all cases. Running with $1 = N$ leaves us with pretty much only one possibility in the the $n = 2$ case: any singleton set squared gives the other singleton set while their product equals 1 (i.e. all of $N$). Writing $c: \mathcal{P}(N) \to \mathcal{P}(N)$ for the complement-operator this 'multiplication' can be written as $$A * B = c^{|A||B|}(A \cap B).$$ this formula looks pretty nice, but already breaks down in the $n = 1$ case. If we take the more agnostic stand point that $A * B = c^{f(A, B)}(A \cap B)$ for 'some' function $f$ we still get nowhere as this formula is bound to give elements satisfying $x^3 = 1$ while we want all elements to satisfy $x^{2^n - 1} = 1$, with at least one $x$ not satisfying $x^k = 1$ for any $k < 2^n -1$. However, if there is any good idea in this $n = 2$ case to take with us to higher cases (similar to the idea of taking 1 to be the full set from the n = 1 case) then my bet would be it is the idea of taking $A^{-1}$ to be the complement of $A$.

37,A Countable Powerset -- Where am I wrong?,A Countable Powerset -- Where am I wrong?,,"Cantor's Theorem seems pretty airtight to me. So what is wrong with the following reasoning? Consider $X = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. We say $X$ contains uncountably many sets . But the only sets that exist are those asserted to exist by the axioms. So if we consider each of the axioms that assert more sets, starting with $\emptyset$, we have one set. The pairing axiom can only produce countably many more. Union gives us up to one more set per set in existence. Powerset also gives us up to one more set per set in existence. Separation and replacement gives us countably many more sets per set in existence. Infinity gives us more more set. Foundation gives us one more set per set in existence. Choice also only gives us one more set per set in existence. It seems to me that the axioms only ever define countably many sets.

If sets can only contain sets, $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ must be countable. I'm still not getting the argument about parameters coming from somewhere . I understand the notion of parameters in the context of definability in a structure , but this question is about a theory (ZFC), whose axioms are well formed formulas in the language of set theory ($\forall,\land,\neg,\in$).

Since $f$ is surjective, for all $b \in B$ , there exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ . Since $f$ is injective, fixing one $b \in B$ , its preimage is unique. Define the map $g(b) = a$ .

Furthermore, for any $a \in A$ whose image under $f$ is some $b \in B$ , we have: \begin{align*} (g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g (b) = a. \end{align*} Since $a$ was arbitrary, \begin{align*} g \circ f = \text{id}_A.  \end{align*} Similarly, for arbitrary $b \in B$ with unique preimage $a \in A$ , we have: \begin{align*} (f \circ g)(b) = f(g(b)) = f(a) = b. \end{align*} Since $b$ was arbitrary, \begin{align*} (f \circ g) = \text{id}_B. \end{align*} Hence, $g = f^{-1}$ , so $f$ is invertible.

We will prove that $f$ is injective and surjective. To establish the latter, let $b \in B$ . Since $f^{-1}$ is a total function on $B$ , there exists a unique $a \in A$ such that $f^{-1} (b) = a$ . Applying $f$ on the left gives $$f(f^{-1} (b)) = f(a).$$ By the definition of composition, $$(f \circ f^{-1})(b) = f(a).$$ But $f \circ f^{-1} = \text{id}_B$ : $$\text{id}_B (b) = f(a)$$ By definition, $$b = f(a)$$ Hence, there exists $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$ , so $f$ is surjective. Now, we show that $f$ is injective. Let $a_1, a_2 \in A$ , and suppose that $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ . Applying $f^{-1}$ on the left gives $$f^{-1}(f(a_1)) = f^{-1} f(a_2).$$ By the definition of composition, $$(f^{-1} \circ f)(a_1) = (f^{-1} \circ f)(a_2)$$ But $f^{-1} \circ f = \text{id}_A$ : $$\text{id}_A (a_1) = \text{id}_A (a_2).$$ By definition, $$a_1 = a_2.$$ Hence, $f$ is injective.

59,Using nested intervals to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable,Using nested intervals to prove that  is not countable,\mathbb{R},"I am having trouble understanding this proof from the book ""Understanding Analysis"" by Stephen Abbot. The problematic part is on page 29 of the book, which is available on google books . Assuming that $\mathbb{R}$ is countable, it can be represented as a sequence of numbers: $\mathbb{R}_s = \{ x_1, x_2, x_3, ... \}$ The idea of the proof is to use nested interval theorem to show that there exists $x \in \mathbb{R}$ that is not an element of the sequence $\mathbb{R}_s$. This would mean that no such sequence of real number exists. The proof goes on to construct finite and nested intervals $I$ such that: (1) $x_{n} \notin I_n$ and (2) $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$. It is assumed that $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers. Since $x_{n} \ne I_n$, it is clear that for the first number we choose (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ This contradicts with the nested interval theorem that states the opposite: $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \ne \emptyset$ Therefore no such sequence $\mathbb{R}_s$ can be constructed, which means $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable. My questions Q1: If all the intervals are finite , how can we even use $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$? Example: Choose $x_3$ for $x_{n0}$ and $\{x_4, x_5, .... x_{n}\}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ for $I_1$ - following (1) and (2). How can I construct infinitely many nested intervals from a finite $I_1$ following (1) and (2)? There are maximally $n-1$ such nested sub-intervals, if $I_{n+1}$ is constructed from $I_n$ such that the first or the last element of $I_n$ is chosen as $x_{n+1}$. Q2: This part: (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real   numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ (3) is perfectly clear, but how does that lead to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$? I mean, sure, (3) is valid for any $x_{n0} \in \mathbb{R}_s$, but that doesn't break the nested interval theorem. The nested interval theorem states basically that $I_n \ne \emptyset$. Is this the point? Rules (1) and (2) will enforce a constructuion of such $I_{n}$ that is an empty set, causing the intersection of all intervals to be empty?","I am having trouble understanding this proof from the book ""Understanding Analysis"" by Stephen Abbot.

This would mean that no such sequence of real number exists. The proof goes on to construct finite and nested intervals $I$ such that: (1) $x_{n} \notin I_n$ and (2) $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$. It is assumed that $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers. Since $x_{n} \ne I_n$, it is clear that for the first number we choose (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ This contradicts with the nested interval theorem that states the opposite: $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \ne \emptyset$ Therefore no such sequence $\mathbb{R}_s$ can be constructed, which means $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable. My questions Q1: If all the intervals are finite , how can we even use $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$? Example: Choose $x_3$ for $x_{n0}$ and $\{x_4, x_5, .... x_{n}\}, n \in \mathbb{N}$ for $I_1$ - following (1) and (2). How can I construct infinitely many nested intervals from a finite $I_1$ following (1) and (2)? There are maximally $n-1$ such nested sub-intervals, if $I_{n+1}$ is constructed from $I_n$ such that the first or the last element of $I_n$ is chosen as $x_{n+1}$. Q2: This part: (3) $x_{n0} \notin\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$ However, the proof claims that since $\mathbb{R}_s$ contains all real   numbers , this leads to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$ (3) is perfectly clear, but how does that lead to $\cap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset$? I mean, sure, (3) is valid for any $x_{n0} \in \mathbb{R}_s$, but that doesn't break the nested interval theorem. The nested interval theorem states basically that $I_n \ne \emptyset$. Is this the point? Rules (1) and (2) will enforce a constructuion of such $I_{n}$ that is an empty set, causing the intersection of all intervals to be empty?",,['elementary-set-theory']

In general one could say that a class is something of the form $\{ x \, | \, \varphi ( x ) \}$ where $\varphi ( x)$ is some formula in the language of set theory, having only $x$ as free variable. I know that these (i.e. classes) are just a matter of handy notation, and that in principle they can always 'deleted', so they're not really part of the language.

I thought I understood this, however I have the following concern. I will give a concrete example below. Let $A=\{ x \, | \, \varphi ( x ) \}$ be a class, and let $B$ be the class $\{ x \, | \, \emptyset \in x, \mbox{ and if } y \in x \mbox{ then } \{ y \} \in x \}$. Now, the expression ""$A \in B$"" does make sense, in this particular case, I think. Namely it would be simply an abbreviation of the sentence $\emptyset \in A \wedge \forall y \, ( y \in A \rightarrow \{ y \} \in A )$. And this means that $\varphi ( \emptyset ) \wedge \forall y \, ( \varphi ( y ) \rightarrow \varphi ( \{ y \} ) )$. (Note that in this example the 'a priori' class $B$ in fact happens to be a set itself, assuming some axioms.) So my point is: it seems to be the case that in some cases it would make sense. (Of course, the reason why it makes sense in this particular example is because in the sentence ""$\emptyset \in x, \mbox{ and if } y \in x \mbox{ then } \{ y \} \in x$"" defining the class $B$, there are only terms of the form $\ldots \in x$, and not the other way around; if for example there would have appeared $x \in \emptyset$ we would finally get $A \in \emptyset$ which doesn't make any sense.) Thus, I think that in general it does not make sense to write things like ""$A \in B$"" where $A$ and $B$ are classes. But I'm a bit in doubt about all of this, as it seems pretty confusing.
