0,Expressing $\cos\theta - \sqrt{3}\sin\theta = r\sin(\theta - \alpha)$,Expressing,\cos\theta - \sqrt{3}\sin\theta = r\sin(\theta - \alpha),"My book explains that $a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta$ is a sine (or cosine) graph with a particular amplitude/shift (i.e. $r\sin(\theta + \alpha)$) and shows me some steps to solve for $r$ and $\alpha$: $$r\sin(\theta + \alpha) \equiv a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta$$ $$\Rightarrow r\sin\theta\cos\alpha + r\cos\theta\sin\alpha \equiv a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta$$ I see the basic trig identity $\sin(a + b) \equiv \sin a\cos b + \sin b\cos a$ is being used, and the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are easily identified as: $$r\sin\alpha = a$$ $$r\cos\alpha = b$$ Then the book squares and adds the equations: $$r^2(\sin^2\alpha + \cos^2\alpha) = a^2 + b^2 \Rightarrow r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$ I see that the basic identity $\sin^2\alpha + \cos^2\alpha \equiv 1$ is being used here.

I tried this and ran into problems as the squaring and square rooting process only ever produces a positive $r$, but the answer is $-2\sin(\theta - \frac{1}{6}\pi)$. My workings: $\cos\theta - \sqrt{3}\sin\theta = r\sin(\theta - \alpha) = r\sin\theta\cos\alpha - r\sin\alpha\cos\theta$ $\Rightarrow r\cos\alpha = -\sqrt{3}$, $r\sin\alpha = -1$ $\Rightarrow r^2\cos^2\alpha = 3$, $r^2\sin^2\alpha = 1 => r^2(\cos^2\alpha + \sin^2\alpha) = 4$ $\Rightarrow r^2 = 4 \Rightarrow r = \pm2$. My question is how should the process in the book be refined so one knows whether $r$ should be positive or negative?

4,Question regarding approximation for $\sin^3(x)$,Question regarding approximation for,\sin^3(x),"I encountered the following approximation for $\sin(x)$ in a physics book: $$ \textrm{for }x\in[0,\pi]\textrm{, }\quad \sin^3(x)\approx \left[\frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\cos(x)\right)}{\sin(x)}\right]^2 $$ Plotting both of these functions on the specified interval produces the following Mathematica Plot , indicating that the approximation is quite good. I was wondering if there was a way to get an intuition for where this approximation comes from or even a rigorous derivation. Here's what I've attempted so far: Because there's a half in the argument of the outer cosine, I tried using the half angle Identity to simplify the RHS of the approximation and got $$ \frac{\left(\cos\left(\pi\cos\left(x\right)\right)+1\right)}{2\sin^{2}\left(x\right)}$$ Because both functions are equal at $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$ I tried using a Maclaurin series in $u=x-\frac{\pi}{2}$ . However, the coefficients never match because the LHS always has rational coefficients whereas the RHS has coefficients which are rational multiples of powers of $\pi$ . I then tried expanding either side in terms of Legendre polynomials in u (renormalized to be orthonormal with the inner product $(L_m,L_n)=\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}} ^{\frac{\pi}{2}}L_mL_ndu$ and got the following values: $$n=0: 0.447, 0.424$$ $$n=2: −0.736, −0.745$$ $$n=4: 0.376, 0.427$$ $$n=6: −0.110, −0.122$$ With the first value corresponding to the coefficient for the RHS and the second value corresponding to the coefficient for the LHS. These coefficients don't get closer for larger values of $n$ as far as I could tell, so this method failed as well, indicating that this approximation didn't come from messing around with Legendre polynomials (I'm assuming that other sets of orthogonal polynomials will fail as well).

8,Photo image to find the screen orientation,Photo image to find the screen orientation,,"I am trying to find the angle of tilts of a screen using projection of a circle from a source $S$. The light beam falls on the photo screen to expose it and what we get is an ellipse with major axis $a$ and minor axis $b$. The light beam is in the form of a cone so what we get is essentially an ellipse on the screen. The screen tilts with angle $\alpha$ to the vertical axis $y$ and $\beta$ with the horizontal axis $x$. Rotation about the $z$ axis does not affects the shape of the ellipse so it can be ignored for the moment. The transformed plane can be given by: $\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1\\z_1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos\alpha&\sin\alpha\\0&-\sin\alpha&\cos\alpha\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta&0&-\sin\beta\\0&1&0\\\sin\beta&0&\cos\beta\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\cos\gamma&-\sin\gamma&0\\\sin\gamma&\cos\gamma&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$ so ignoring $z$ and setting $\gamma = 0$ we get, $$\ x_1=x\cos\beta \ + \ y\sin\alpha \sin\beta $$ and  $$  \ y_1=\ y\cos\alpha$$ Now on the screen $P$ is vertical axis and $Q$ is the horizontal axis, $\theta$ is the angle of semi-major axis with horizontal- $Q$. To get the same ellipse as in the projection we can use the shear transformation of an ellipse on the screen: Rotation transformation gives: $$P_1 = P\cos\theta \ - \ Q\sin\theta$$ $$P_2 = P\sin\theta \ + \ Q\cos\theta$$ substituting $P_1$ & $P_2$ in ellipse equation with $a$ & $b$ as major and minor axis followed by vertical shear transformation we can get the limits to the ellipse w.r.t angle $\theta$, which are: $\sqrt{a^2\sin^2\theta +b^2\cos^2\theta } \ $ for the horizontal axis $Q$ $\sqrt{b^2\sin^2\theta +a^2\cos^2\theta } \ $ for the vertical axis $P$ After being done with that, we do the same procedure using $x_1$ and $y_1$ to apply the transformation to a circle using equation of a circle. After the shear transformation of those equation we get the equations giving the maximum limit: $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha +a^2\sin^2\alpha \sin^2\beta } \ $ for horizontal axis $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha }\ $ for vertical axis For getting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in terms of $\theta$ we use the above equations as the maximum extent of both the cases must be equal to get the same ellipse. so: $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha +a^2\sin^2\alpha \sin^2\beta }=\sqrt{b^2\cos^2\theta +a^2\sin^2\theta }$ and $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha }=\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta +b^2\sin^2\theta }$ Solving these equation we get: $$\alpha =\cos^{-1}\sqrt{\cos^2\theta +\frac{b}{a^2}^2\sin^2\theta }$$ $$\beta =\sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\cos^2\theta \left(\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1\right)}{\sin^2\theta \left(1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}\right)-1}}$$ It turns out it is not giving the correct $\alpha$ & $\beta$ values with $\theta$ but when viewed from the point $S$ along the $z$ axis we get the following image in which the small circle is the circle that is being projected and the bigger ellipse(which would appear as a circle) is the projected ellipse on the screen when viewed from point $S$. Using the angle $\eta$, that is the angle between the vertical axis and the ellipse major axis when viewed from point $S$, in the above angle equations ($\alpha, \beta$) in the place of $\theta$ and keeping the other parameters same, we observe that it gives the correct value of $\alpha$ & $\beta$ Now in general case we cannot use this method ($\eta$) to find the angles as we would just have the screen photo image of the ellipse. Can this $\eta$ be related to $\theta$ by any means or what can be done to change the angles equation to get the correct value? I am using a software to simulate this so I can see from the source position and get the $\eta$ angle but in practical case it can not be done as we will just have the photo of the ellipse.
