5,Proving a statement false by reverse induction,Proving a statement false by reverse induction,,"On a recent graph theory assignment, I proved a statement false by ""reverse"" induction, showing that $P(2)$ was false, and that $P(k) \implies P(k-1)$ for $k>2$, thus, by the contrapositive, $\neg P(k-1) \implies \neg P(k)$, so $P(n)$ should be false for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. This seems natural and like it should work in general, but after a quick Google search into ""reverse induction"", nothing like this proof technique showed, at least in the first few results. For completeness, here's the statement and my proof. Does there exist a graph with vertex set $\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ such that $\deg(v_i)= i-1$ for $i=1,\dots,n$? Answer: No Proof: It does not work for $n=2$, since the first vertex would be a singleton, and the second vertex must have degree one, so it must be connected to the first, but this is impossible since the first vertex would then have degree one, a contradiction. Now for $n \geq 2$, Consider a labeling $\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_{n+1}\}$, and suppose that there is a set of edges such that $\deg v_i = i-1$. Then by removing $v_{n+1}$ an all edges connected to it, we would have a graph with vertex set $\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}$, such that $\deg v_i = i-1$. The contrapositive of this however, is that if there is no vertex set on $\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_n\}$, such that $\deg v_i = i-1$, then there is no graph with vertex set $\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_{n+1}\}$ such that $\deg v_i = i-1$.

I want to prove that a $2$-connected graph contains a cycle. Note that a $k$-connected graph is a graph that contains at least $k+1$ vertices, but does not contain a set of $k-1$ vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. Hence, let us consider a graph $G$ such that $|V(G)| \geq 3$ such that there is no cut set of size $1$. I imagine what I am looking to force onto this graph is a cycle of size $3$, and thus I should probably condition on all vertex subsets of size $3$ in the graph $G$. I tried finding a contradiction after I assume that none of these subsets  contained an odd cycle, but I haven't been able to contradict $2$-connectedness with this statement. Is it possible that I should condition on a single vertex, and find a way to construct a cycle using the fact that this vertex does not have the ability to disconnect the graph after its removal?",,"['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory']"

86,The nature of variables within proofs,The nature of variables within proofs,,"I am confused about how best to view certain kinds of variables that show up in the course of an elementary proof. For example, to prove that the square of every odd integer is odd, I would write: Let $m \in \mathbf{Z}$ be arbitrary. Suppose $m$ is odd. Choose $k \in \mathbf{Z}$ such that $m = 2k + 1$ . Then $m^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$ , so since $2k^2 + 2k \in \mathbf{Z}$ , it follows that $m^2$ is odd. The symbol $m$ is introduced as part of the technique of universal generalization; Velleman [1] describes this step as ""introducing a new variable [ $m$ ] ... to stand for an arbitrary object.""

87,"Solving Coin-Weighing Problem (81 Coins, 1 Fake) Using Information Theory","Solving Coin-Weighing Problem (81 Coins, 1 Fake) Using Information Theory",,"So I have a coin-weighing puzzle under these situations: There are 80 real coins and 1 fake coin (total of 81 coins). The real coins are all the same weight, and the weight of the fake coin is different from the real coin. The real and fake coins cannot be distinguished, other than weight. A balance is used to identify the fake coin. When using the balance, the same number of coins is placed on either plate. The result is either ""the left plate is heavier,"" ""the right plate is heavier,"" or ""the two plates are the same weight."" According to prior research, this problem cannot be solved by using the balance 4 times or less. I tried to show this by using information theory as follows, but I feel like I am missing something here. Label the coins 1,...,81, and let $C$ be the number of the fake coin. Also, let $W$ be a random variable defined so that $W=1$ when the fake coin is heavier than the real coin, and $W=0$ when lighter. At the initial state, $C$ and $W$ can be regarded as independent random variables following a uniform distribution. Then, define random variable $R_k$ so that $R_k = 0$ , $R_k = 1$ , $R_k = 2$ , when, the result after using the balance for the $k$ th time is, respectively, ""the left plate is heavier,"" ""the right plate is heavier,"" or ""the two plates are the same weight."" Then, $R_k$ can be regarded as uniquely determined by $R_1, ..., R_k,$ and the real values of $C$ and $W$ . (Do I have to add additional proof that this is true?) Assume that the fake coin can be surely identified by four measurements using the balance, then this means that the value of $C$ is determined when $R_1,...,R_4$ have been determined. Thus, using the entropy function and its chain rule, \begin{eqnarray*} H(C, W, R_1, ..., R_4) &=& H(C) + H(R_1 | C) + H(R_2 | R_1, C) + H(R_3 | R_2, R_1, C) + H(R_4|R_3, R_2, R_1, C) + H (W| R_4, R_3, R_2, R_1, C) \end{eqnarray*} And, we also have \begin{eqnarray*} H(C, W, R_1, ..., R_4) &=& H(W) + H(C|W) + H(R_1 | C, W) + H(R_2 | R_1, C, W) + H(R_3 | R_2, R_1, C, W) + H(R_4|R_3, R_2, R_1, C, W) \end{eqnarray*} Then we notice that $H(C|W) = H(C)$ , as $C$ and $W$ are independent variables. Also, $H(R_1 | W, C) < H(R_1 | C), H(R_2 | R_1, C, W)  < H(R_2 | R_1, C) $ , and so on. Thus, from the two equations, we get $H(W) < H(W | R_1, ..., R_4, C)$ But we know that $H(W | R_1, ..., R_4, C) < H(W)$ , so there is a contradiction. OK. So I somehow arrived at a contradiction, showing that the problem cannot be solved by using the balance for times.
