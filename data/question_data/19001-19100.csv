Note: The case $p=1$ is the statement that the rows of $A$ have unit norms, and the case $p=n$ is the statement that $(\det A)^2=1$. The conjecture generalizes these two statements. In particular, the conjecture is clearly true for $n=2$. Now, here is a slightly less trivial example: Example: Take $$ A= \begin{pmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2}&0&1/\sqrt{2}\\ -1/\sqrt{6}&\sqrt{2/3}&1/\sqrt{6}\\ 1/\sqrt{3}&1/\sqrt{3}&-1/\sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix}\in O(3). $$ Then, with $p=2$ and $i_1=1$, $i_2=2$ we have $$ \begin{vmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2}&0\\ -1/\sqrt{6}&\sqrt{2/3} \end{vmatrix}^2 + \begin{vmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2}&1/\sqrt{2}\\ -1/\sqrt{6}&1/\sqrt{6} \end{vmatrix}^2 + \begin{vmatrix} 0&1/\sqrt{2}\\ \sqrt{2/3}&1/\sqrt{6} \end{vmatrix}^2 =\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}=1. $$",,"['linear-algebra', 'matrices']"

Using $A^{-1}$ as the inverse, $A^{-k}=\left(A^{-1}\right)^k$ is easy to define, but requires the matrix to be invertible. So much for integral exponents. Rational definition I guess for a rational exponent, one could define $$A^{\frac pq}=B\quad:\Leftrightarrow\quad A^p=B^q$$ This will allow for more than one solution, and I'm not sure if the computations I'll describe below will find all solutions satisfying the above equation. So I'm not sure whether that's a reasonable definition. For non-rational exponents, a limit using a convergent series of rational exponents might work. Diagonalizable computation If $A$ is diagonalizable , then one has $A=W\,D\,W^{-1}$ for some diagonal matrix $D$. One can simply raise all the diagonal elements to the $p$-th power, obtaining a matrix which will satisfy the above equation. For each diagonal element, I'd define $\lambda^p=e^{(p\ln\lambda)}$, and since $\ln\lambda$ is only defined up to $2\pi i\mathbb Z$, this allows for multiple possible solutions. If one requires $-\pi<\operatorname{Im}(\ln\lambda)\le\pi$, then the solution should be well defined, and I guess this definition even has a name, although I don't know it. Non-diagonalizable computation If $A$ is not diagonalizable, then there is still a Jordan normal form , so instead of raising diagonal elements to a fractional power, one could attempt to do the same with Jordan blocks. Unless I made a mistake, this appears to be possible. At least for my example of a $3\times3$ Jordan block, I was able to obtain a $k$-th root. $$ \begin{pmatrix} \lambda^{\frac1k} & \tfrac1k\lambda^{\frac1k-1} & \tfrac{1-k}{2k^2}\lambda^{\frac1k-2} & \\ 0 & \lambda^{\frac1k} & \tfrac1k\lambda^{\frac1k-1} \\ 0 & 0 & \lambda^{\frac1k} \end{pmatrix}^k = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & \lambda \end{pmatrix} $$ If the eigenvalue $\lambda$ of this block is zero, then the root as computed above would be the zero matrix, which doesn't result in a Jordan block. But otherwise it should work. Conclusion Edited since this question was first asked.

Color each edge with red, blue or yellow. Now, we call a coloring of graph as good if any three edges incident with any vertex have one color or three colors. Prove that the number of good coloring of $G$ must be a power of $3$ . I have very short solution using linear algebra: If $M$ is an incidence matrix of this graph and we color each edge with colors $0,1,2$ then we have to find a number of vectors $\vec{c}\in \mathbb{Z}_3^{\varepsilon}$ such that $M\vec{c} =\vec{0} \in \mathbb{Z}_3^{n}$ where $\varepsilon$ is a number of edges $G$ . So we are interested in $|\ker(M)|$ , but $\ker(M)\leq  \mathbb{Z}_3^{\varepsilon}$ and thus $|\ker(M)| = 3^{d}$ where $d=\dim (\ker(M))$ . Even more, we can find exact number of colorings. By handshake lemma we have $\varepsilon = 3n/2$ so $n$ is even and by  rank-nullity theorem we have $$ d=\varepsilon -{\rm rank} (M) $$ There is a theorem that says if $G$ is connected then: $${\rm rank}(M)=\cases{n-1;\;{\rm if\;}G\;{\rm is\;bipartite}\\ \;\;n\;\;\;\;;\;{\rm else}}$$ So $d={n\over 2}+1$ if $G$ is bipartite and $d={n\over 2}$ else.

I am NOT after a proof of this fact; what I am curious about is whether there is a geometric argument for it. I am after the sort of intuition one gets from looking at linear transformations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and envisioning their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For example, it is very intuitively clear why nontrivial rotation matrices cannot have real eigenvectors. It is also geometrically clear why diagonal matrices have their eigenvalues equal to their diagonal elements. EDIT: Upon further thought, I have realized that a simple consequence of symmetry is that in the singular value decomposition of a matrix $M = U \Sigma V^*$, we have $U = V$. Thus requiring symmetry means that the linear transformation must be accomplished by performing a rotation, performing a scaling along the axes, and then reversing the original rotation .

29,Determinant of a standard magic square,Determinant of a standard magic square,,"What is the lowest positive, what the highest possible value for the determinant of a standard-magic-square-matrix of order $n$ ? Are there singular standard-magic-square-matrices of any order greater than $3$ ? First of all, the determinant of a standard-magic-square-matrix must be a multiple of $\frac{n^2(n^2+1)}{2}$ for odd $n$ . This follows easily by the following process: Add all the columns to the last column. Then every entry in the last column is $\frac{n(n^2+1)}{2}$ ,the constant of the standard-magic-square. Now extract this constant and add all the rows to the last one. Then every entry in the last row is again the constant, beside the last entry, which is $n$ . Since $n$ is for odd n a divisor of the constant, it can be extracted as well. For even $n$ , only $\frac{n}{2}$ can be extracted, so the determinant is only a multiple of $\frac{n^2(n^2+1)}{4}$ . This gives lower bounds for the absolute value of the determinant of regular magic-square-matrices. For size $3$ , the only possible determinant (ignoring the sign) is $360$ .

The community reviewed whether to reopen this question last year and left it closed: Original close reason(s) were not resolved I know that there are three important results when taking the Determinants of Block matrices $$\begin{align}\det \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ 0 & D  \end{bmatrix} &= \det(A) \cdot \det(D) \ \ \ \ & (1) \\ \\ \det \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D  \end{bmatrix} &\neq AD - CB & (2) \\ \\ \det \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ C & D  \end{bmatrix} &= \det \begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ 0 & D - CA^{-1}B \end{bmatrix} \\ \\ &= \underbrace{\det(A)\cdot \det\left(D-CA^{-1}B\right)}_\text{if $A^{-1}$ exists} \\ \\ &= \underbrace{\det\left(AD-CB\right)}_\text{if $AC=CA$} & (3) \end{align}$$ Now I understand in result $(3)$, that all that row operations are being performed to bring it into the form we see in $(1)$, but I can't seem to convince myself that result $(1)$ is true in the first place. Furthermore in result $(3)$, I understand that,  $\det(A)\cdot \det\left(D-CA^{-1}B\right) = \det\left(A(D-CA^{-1}B)\right)= \det(AD-CB)$, via the product rule for determinants I also understand that we need $A^{-1}$ to exist, for the initial row operation to reduce the matrix into an upper triangular form $U$, and I understand that we require $AC = CA$, to allow commutativity when we multiply $ACA^{-1}B$ to reduce it to $CB$.
