It's well known that, if $x_n$ converges weakly to $ x $ in a Banach space $X$, then there exists a sequence $\{y_l\}$ of convex combinations of the $x_n$ converging strong to $ x $. (Banach space is not needed) Now in Brézis, as an exercise, I should show: 1). if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ such that    $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}\left(\bigcup_{i=l}^\infty \{x_i\}\right) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $ 2.) if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ s.t   $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}(\bigcup_{i=1}^l \{x_i\}) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $   where $\operatorname{conv}$ is the convex hull. My proof of 1) is like this: I will use that every convex set is closed if and only if it's weakly closed. so proof of 1): $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge 1})) $ therefore I can pick a $ y_1 $ s.t.  $ y_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{m_1} \lambda_i x_i $ which is in $\operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n \ge 1})$ and $\| y_1 - x\| < \frac{1}{2}$. Then we know, that $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}))$, clearly  choose $ y_2 $ s.t.  $$ y_2= \sum_{i=m_1+1}^{m_2} \lambda_i x_i  \mbox{ such that }  \|y_2-x\| < \frac{1}{4}.$$ Just as a note, $ y_2 \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}) $  Suppose we have chosen our sequence up to an index $ k $. We know: $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_k})) $ again choose $ y_{k+1} $ s.t : $$y_{k+1}= \sum_{i=m_k+1}^{m_{k+1}} \lambda_i x_i\mbox{ such that }  \|y_{k+1}-x\| < \frac{1}{2^{k+1}}.$$ and this should prove 1), if I'm not wrong. As a question at the point where I have chosen the $y_{k+1}$: the $x_i$ in the sum are not the same as for the sequence. To be precise, the $ x_i $ in the sum is not the $ i$-th element of the sequence, right? If not, why can I choose it in such a way? Looking at 2) it's clear, that $ y_1 = x_1 $. If it exists an index $ N_0 $ s.t. $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\le N_0})) $, then I have no troubles since I can choose a $ y_k $ as ""near"" to $ x $ as I want. Therefore I get strong convergence.  So should I just choose the $ y_1, \dots y_{{N_0}-1} $ as an arbitrary convex combination, and start choosing $y_{N_0}$ in a way, such that the sequence converges (Since the finitely many elements at the beginning are not important for convergence). However I'm not sure any more about the existence of such an index $ N_0 $. Edit: I have a new idea about 2). define $ \alpha_k:= inf \|x-y_k\| $ over all $ y_k \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le k}) $.  Obviously $ \alpha_k \ge \alpha_{k+1}$. Claim: $ \alpha_k \to 0 $. proof: let $ \epsilon > 0 $, it exists a $ z_\epsilon \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge_1})$,hence $ z_\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{m(\epsilon)} \lambda_ix_i $, s.t $ \|x-z_\epsilon \| \le \epsilon $ Therefore we could find a $ N \in \mathbb{N} $ s.t. $ x_1, \dots, x_{m(\epsilon)} \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le N}) $ so we conclude, $ \alpha_{N+1} \le \epsilon $. Is there another way to solve this? Are my proofs / thoughts correct? Thanks. math","Working through Brézis and solving an exercise I have a question about my solution. It's well known that, if $x_n$ converges weakly to $ x $ in a Banach space $X$, then there exists a sequence $\{y_l\}$ of convex combinations of the $x_n$ converging strong to $ x $. (Banach space is not needed) Now in Brézis, as an exercise, I should show: 1). if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ such that    $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}\left(\bigcup_{i=l}^\infty \{x_i\}\right) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $ 2.) if $ x_n \rightharpoondown x $  weakly then it exists a sequence $ y_l $ s.t   $ y_l \in \operatorname{conv}(\bigcup_{i=1}^l \{x_i\}) \forall l $ s.t. $ y_l \to x $   where $\operatorname{conv}$ is the convex hull. My proof of 1) is like this: I will use that every convex set is closed if and only if it's weakly closed. so proof of 1): $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge 1})) $ therefore I can pick a $ y_1 $ s.t.  $ y_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{m_1} \lambda_i x_i $ which is in $\operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n \ge 1})$ and $\| y_1 - x\| < \frac{1}{2}$. Then we know, that $ x \in cl(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}))$, clearly  choose $ y_2 $ s.t.  $$ y_2= \sum_{i=m_1+1}^{m_2} \lambda_i x_i  \mbox{ such that }  \|y_2-x\| < \frac{1}{4}.$$ Just as a note, $ y_2 \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_1}) $  Suppose we have chosen our sequence up to an index $ k $. We know: $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\ge m_k})) $ again choose $ y_{k+1} $ s.t : $$y_{k+1}= \sum_{i=m_k+1}^{m_{k+1}} \lambda_i x_i\mbox{ such that }  \|y_{k+1}-x\| < \frac{1}{2^{k+1}}.$$ and this should prove 1), if I'm not wrong. As a question at the point where I have chosen the $y_{k+1}$: the $x_i$ in the sum are not the same as for the sequence. To be precise, the $ x_i $ in the sum is not the $ i$-th element of the sequence, right? If not, why can I choose it in such a way? Looking at 2) it's clear, that $ y_1 = x_1 $. If it exists an index $ N_0 $ s.t. $ x \in \operatorname{cl}(\operatorname{conv}\{x_n\}_{n\le N_0})) $, then I have no troubles since I can choose a $ y_k $ as ""near"" to $ x $ as I want. Therefore I get strong convergence.  So should I just choose the $ y_1, \dots y_{{N_0}-1} $ as an arbitrary convex combination, and start choosing $y_{N_0}$ in a way, such that the sequence converges (Since the finitely many elements at the beginning are not important for convergence). However I'm not sure any more about the existence of such an index $ N_0 $. Edit: I have a new idea about 2). define $ \alpha_k:= inf \|x-y_k\| $ over all $ y_k \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le k}) $.  Obviously $ \alpha_k \ge \alpha_{k+1}$. Claim: $ \alpha_k \to 0 $. proof: let $ \epsilon > 0 $, it exists a $ z_\epsilon \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\ge_1})$,hence $ z_\epsilon = \sum_{i=1}^{m(\epsilon)} \lambda_ix_i $, s.t $ \|x-z_\epsilon \| \le \epsilon $ Therefore we could find a $ N \in \mathbb{N} $ s.t. $ x_1, \dots, x_{m(\epsilon)} \in \operatorname{conv}(\{x_n\}_{n\le N}) $ so we conclude, $ \alpha_{N+1} \le \epsilon $. Is there another way to solve this? Are my proofs / thoughts correct? Thanks. math",,"['functional-analysis', 'convex-analysis']"

38,Reference for Martingale version of Riesz representation theorem / Riemann–Stieltjes integral,Reference for Martingale version of Riesz representation theorem / Riemann–Stieltjes integral,,"(Please let me know if this is more appropriate as a MathOverflow question.) I can work out most of the following martingale generalization to the Riesz representation theorem and the Riemann–Stieltjes integral.  But I also imagine it is a standard result, and I am looking for a reference. The result: Let $(X,\mathcal{B},P)$ be a Borel probability measure on a compact space $X$.  Let $M_n$ be a (discrete time) $\mathcal{L}^1$-bounded martingale on a filtration $\mathcal{F_n}$ such that $\mathcal{F_n}\uparrow\mathcal{B}$ and $coarseness(\mathcal{F}_n)\rightarrow0$ where $coarseness(\mathcal{F}_n)\leq\delta$ iff there is a countable set $\{A_k\}\subseteq\mathcal{F}_n$ which covers $X$ such that $diameter(A_k)\leq \delta$ for all $k$.  (Update: I didn't originally have this courseness/diameter stuff, but I think I need it. So I am also now assuming there is a metric on $X$. Also, the $\mathcal{F_n}\uparrow\mathcal{B}$ condition is now redundant.) Then for continuous functions $g$ on $X$, define the integral $\int g\ dM = \lim_n \mathbb{E}[g M_n]$.  It is easy to check it is a bounded linear transformation on continuous functions, and hence an integral. (Update: The proof that it converges is at the end.) Let $\nu$ be the corresponding signed measure.  Then the limit of $M_n$ is the Radon–Nikodym derivative $d \nu /dP$.  Also, $\nu$ is absolutely continuous if $M_n$ is uniformly integrable,  $\nu$ is singular if $M_n$ converges to $0$ a.e., and $\nu$ is positive if $M_k$ is nonnegative.  (Update: I originally wrote these as ""if and only if""s but the situation is a bit more subtle, just like with bounded variation functions.) Where can I find a reference for this? I can see how this would not be a standard probability result since I am assuming something topological about the sample space. Update: Proof that $\lim_n \mathbb{E}[g M_n]$ converges.
