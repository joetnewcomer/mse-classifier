The two definitions agree when $I$ is a set (treated as discrete for the purposes of (2)) and $X_i=X$ is constant, so that $C(I,X)=\prod_{i\in I}X$. Thus we can in some sense understand the index set $I$ as always being discrete in the product topology. Is there a way for us to generalize these two constructions into one where the index set is topologized, but the fibers are not all the same?

I'm asking because several textbook references on topological vector spaces claim that both addition and multiplication are uniformly continuous functions, but I suspect uniform continuity of scalar multiplication can only be established in a restricted sense, i.e. , when it is interpreted for a given scalar and not when $\mathbb R$ is considered as a tvs in its own right to be multiplied with $X$ to form a product tvs. In particular, I'm confused as to which of these two notions of “scalar multiplication” is appropriate when one is talking about the uniform continuity of such an operation.",,"['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'vector-spaces', 'continuity']"

Show that if both $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$, then $f$ is continuous.

This is almost what we want, except that we want to find an open set $U$ of $X$ s.t. $U \subset A, a \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. This is because $U_{1}$ being open in $A$ does not necessarily mean that it's open in $X$ because $A$ is closed in $X$. (i know how to expand this argument out if needed) My idea now is to try to find a subset $U$ of $U_{1}$ such that $U$ is open in $X$. We have two cases: (1) $U_{1}$ does not intersect the boundary of $A$. (2) $U_{1}$ intersects the boundary of $A$. Now I'm not sure what to do.

Here it is: Let $X = A \cup B$, $A$ and $B$ are subspaces of $X$. Let $f:X \rightarrow Y.$ Suppose that the restricted functions $f_{|A}:A \rightarrow Y$ and $f_{|B}:B \rightarrow Y$ are continuous. Show that if both $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$, then $f$ is continuous. Our definition of continuity is: $f$ is continuous at $x \in X$ if for each open set $V$ of $Y$ containing $f(x)$, there is an open set $U$ of $X$ containing $x$ such that $f(U) \subset V$. $f$ is continuous if it is continuous at each point of its domain. What I've tried so far: Suppose $A$ and $B$ are closed in $X$. Suppose $A \cap B = \emptyset$. Then $X -A$ is open in $X$. But $X - A = B$ which is closed in $X$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $A \cap B \ne  \emptyset$. I'm not sure if this will be useful in the problem or not. If $x \in X$, then it's either in $A$ or in $B$. Suppose without loss of generality that it's in $A$. Then for all open sets $V$ of $Y$ s.t. $f(x) \in V$, $\exists$ an open set $U_{1}$ of $A$ s.t. $U_{1} \subset A, a \in U_{1}$ and $f(U_{1}) \subset V$. This is almost what we want, except that we want to find an open set $U$ of $X$ s.t. $U \subset A, a \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. This is because $U_{1}$ being open in $A$ does not necessarily mean that it's open in $X$ because $A$ is closed in $X$. (i know how to expand this argument out if needed) My idea now is to try to find a subset $U$ of $U_{1}$ such that $U$ is open in $X$. We have two cases: (1) $U_{1}$ does not intersect the boundary of $A$. (2) $U_{1}$ intersects the boundary of $A$. Now I'm not sure what to do.

85,Expressing $\mathbb{R}$ as the quotient of a disjoint union of unit intervals,Expressing  as the quotient of a disjoint union of unit intervals,\mathbb{R},"I am trying to complete exercise 3.18(a) in Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifolds.

(a) Show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a wedge sum of countably infinitely many circles. Lee gives the hint that one should express both spaces as quotients of a disjoint union of intervals, implying that one will make use of the uniqueness of quotient spaces. The wedge sum of countably infinitely many circles is the space $B=\bigvee_{i=0} ^\infty S_i ^1=\amalg_{i=0} ^\infty S_i ^1/\{p_i\}$ , where $p_i \in S_i ^1$ and $\{p_i\}$ denotes the relation $p_i\sim p_j$ for all $i,j$ . Since $S^1$ is the quotient space $I/(0\sim1)$ , we can express $B$ as $B=\amalg_{i=0} ^\infty I_i/\sim$ , where $\sim$ is the relationship $p_i \sim p_j$ for all $i,j$ and $0_i\sim 1_i$ for all $i$ . With this one defines the quotient map $q:\amalg_{i=0} ^\infty I_i \rightarrow B$ by sending elements to their equivalence classes. I am stuck trying come up with a similar formulation for $\mathbb{R}$ . Graphically I could imagine $\mathbb{R}$ being constructed by attaching countably infinitely many of the unit intervals $I_i$ together with the identification $1_i\sim 0_{i+1}$ . Formally this would be $\mathbb{R}=\amalg_{i=0} ^\infty I_i/(1_i\sim 0_{i+1})$ .

This guarantees that the translates of $\mathcal B$ are the basis for a topology on $X$ . However, this doesn't seem to be enough to show that $\mathcal T$ turns $X$ into a TVS.

This holds for all intervals, hence also for all finite unions of intervals. It also holds for open dense sets. I feel like it shouldn’t be true in general but I couldn’t find a counterexample.

99,Set theoretic issues in the definition of k-space or final topology wrt a proper class of functions,Set theoretic issues in the definition of k-space or final topology wrt a proper class of functions,,"In Ronald Brown's Topology and Groupoids ( pdf here ), section 5.9, p. 182, a topological space $X$ is called a k-space if the topology on $X$ coincides with the final topology with respect to all continuous maps $f: C\to X$ for all compact Hausdorff spaces $C$ . The collection of all such spaces $C$ and maps $f$ is not a set, but a proper class.  So it may seem difficult at first to define k-spaces in this way.  But then Proposition 5.9.1 shows that one can in fact choose a set of such spaces $C$ and functions $f$ to achieve the same thing.  I had some issues with the proof, so I'll ask about it in the slightly more general setting of final topologies with respect to a proper class of functions. Suppose $X$ is a set and we have a (well-defined in ZFC) proper class $\mathcal{F}$ of functions $f:Y\to X$ where each $Y$ is a topological space.  (ZFC does not formally have the notion of class, but a well defined class just corresponds to some first order formula in ZFC.  That is the case for all compact Hausdorff spaces for example.) We want to define the final topology $\tau_{\mathcal F}$ on $X$ with respect to $\mathcal{F}$ .  It should be the finest topology that makes all these maps continuous.  Equivalently, a set $U$ in $X$ will be open iff $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Y$ for all $f:Y\to X$ in $\mathcal{F}$ . Result: There is a set $\mathcal{G}$ of elements of $\mathcal{F}$ such that the final topology on $X$ with respect to $\mathcal{G}$ is the same as $\tau_{\mathcal F}$ . The proof (paraphrased from Brown's 5.9.1) goes like this.  For each set $U\subseteq X$ that is not open in $\tau_{\mathcal F}$ choose some $f_U:Y_U\to X$ in $\mathcal{F}$ such that $f_U^{-1}(U)$ is not open in $Y_U$ .  There is a set of such $U$ and the collection $\mathcal{G}$ of the $f_U$ is also a set and has the required property. But does this really work in ZFC?  AC only works when starting with a set of sets, and there is no such thing as the axiom of global choice in ZFC.  I thought we could salvage the argument of choosing the $Y_U$ and $f_U$ like this.  We only care about spaces up to homeomorphism, and each set can be well ordered.  So we can assume each $Y_U$ will be an ordinal.  And by well ordering of ordinals, we can assume $Y_U$ will be the least ordinal that works for $U$ .  All this is expressible by a first order formula in ZFC.  So now we have a set of ordinals and a set of all possible topologies for each of these ordinals and a set of continuous functions between these topological spaces and $X$ .  So finally we can apply regular AC. Does that work, or is there an alternative approach?","In Ronald Brown's Topology and Groupoids ( pdf here ), section 5.9, p. 182, a topological space is called a k-space if the topology on coincides with the final topology with respect to all continuous maps for all compact Hausdorff spaces .
