1,An inductive construct of the Hausdorff reflection,An inductive construct of the Hausdorff reflection,,"I have read that given any topological space $X$ you can construct a Hausdorff space $h(X)$ as a quotient of $X$ which is universal with respect to maps from $X$ to a Hausdorff space. This means there is a quotient map $q:X\to h(X)$ and if $f:X\to W$ is a map to a Hausdorff space, $W$, then there is a unique map $g:h(X)\to W$ such that $gq=f$. It seems you can construct the equivalence relation $\sim$ on $X$ so that $X/\sim$ by saying $x\sim y$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $f(x)=f(y)$ for every map $f:X\to W$ to Hausdorff $W$; this is essentially an application of a general adjoint theorem. I would like to know if it is possible to construct $h(X)$ using a transfinite process of taking quotients of $X$. It seems like the following should be a start: Let $X_0=X$. Say $x\sim_{0} y$ if $x$ and $y$ can't be separated by disjoint open sets in $X$. Let $\sim_{0}'$ be the transitive closure of this relation so you now have an equivalence relation. Now let $X_1=X_0/\sim_{0}'$. Since it seems $X_1$ is not necessarily Hausdorff (I am not even sure it is $T_1$) you can construct the equivalence relation $\sim_{1}'$ on $X_1$ and a quotient map $X\to X_2=X_{1}/\sim_{1}'$ by replacing $0,1$ with $1,2$. You should be able to continue this construction by transfinite induction to get a quotient $X_{\alpha}$ of $X$ for each ordinal $\alpha$. For instance, if $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, define $x\sim_{\alpha}'y$ $\Leftrightarrow$ there is a $\lambda<\alpha$ such that $x\sim_{\lambda}'y$. Does this transfinite sequence of spaces stabilize to $h(X)$? If so, how does one show this?

11,Is a $\sigma$-locally finite collection of open sets locally countable?,Is a -locally finite collection of open sets locally countable?,\sigma,"Problem I encountered this statement on nLab, which says that weakly Lindelöf spaces with a $\sigma$ -locally finite basis are second-countable . The original proof given below the statement is Proof . Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a $\sigma$ -locally finite basis. For each $x\in X$ , there is a neighborhood $N_{x}$ meeting countably many members of $\mathcal{V}$ . If $X$ is weakly Lindelöf, there is a countable $\{N_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ which covers a dense subset of $X$ . Then $\mathcal{U}=\{V\in\mathcal{V}\mid N_n\cap V\neq\varnothing ~\text{for some}~n\}$ is a countable basis for $X$ . The proof is extremely brief, and I couldn't understand the italicized part, which I refer to as the collection $\mathcal{V}$ being locally countable for the time being. I believe it is not a very common property since I've searched $\pi$ -Base and Wikipedia but couldn't find anything about this locally countable property. The proof simply stated it as if it is an easy corollary. I know that $\mathcal{V}$ being a $\sigma$ -locally finite basis implies that $X$ is first-countable, but this doesn't take me any further. My main question is, how could I prove that $\mathcal{V}$ is locally countable? Would $\mathcal{V}$ being a $\sigma$ -locally finite basis alone suffice? In fact, as I claim later, $\mathcal V$ itself is countable, but it requires the additional assumption that the space $X$ is weakly Lindelöf. And this sounds like circular reasoning to me. I would like to know if the locally countable property holds without the weakly Lindelöf assumption. My thoughts In my opinion, the statement itself is true, as $\mathcal{V}$ itself is countable, which follows easily from the following claim which I believe is true: Claim. Every locally finite family of nonempty open subsets of a weakly Lindelöf space is countable. Proof. (This is an imitation of the proof of theorem 5.1.24 of Engelking's General Topology ) Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally finite family of nonempty open subsets of a weakly Lindelöf space $X$ . For every $x\in X$ choose a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ that intersects only finitely many members of $\mathcal{A}$ and take a countable subcover $\mathcal{U}$ that covers a dense subset of $X$ .

The original proof given below the statement is Proof . Let be a -locally finite basis. For each , there is a neighborhood meeting countably many members of . If is weakly Lindelöf, there is a countable which covers a dense subset of . Then is a countable basis for . The proof is extremely brief, and I couldn't understand the italicized part, which I refer to as the collection being locally countable for the time being. I believe it is not a very common property since I've searched -Base and Wikipedia but couldn't find anything about this locally countable property. The proof simply stated it as if it is an easy corollary. I know that being a -locally finite basis implies that is first-countable, but this doesn't take me any further. My main question is, how could I prove that is locally countable? Would being a -locally finite basis alone suffice? In fact, as I claim later, itself is countable, but it requires the additional assumption that the space is weakly Lindelöf. And this sounds like circular reasoning to me. I would like to know if the locally countable property holds without the weakly Lindelöf assumption. My thoughts In my opinion, the statement itself is true, as itself is countable, which follows easily from the following claim which I believe is true: Claim. Every locally finite family of nonempty open subsets of a weakly Lindelöf space is countable. Proof. (This is an imitation of the proof of theorem 5.1.24 of Engelking's General Topology ) Let be a locally finite family of nonempty open subsets of a weakly Lindelöf space . For every choose a neighborhood of that intersects only finitely many members of and take a countable subcover that covers a dense subset of .

A Stonean space is a compact Hausdorff extremally disconnected space i.e. a compact Hausdorff space such that for all open $U$ , its closure $\overline{U}$ is also open.

This Boolean algebra induces a Stonean space $S(X)$ by Stone duality . Thus to any topological space we can assign a Stonean space $S(X)$ . If $X$ is a Stonean space, then $\text{RO}(X)$ is a Boolean algebra of clopen sets of $X$ , so that Stone duality tells us $S(X)$ gives us $X$ back. If $f:X\to Y$ is a continuous map, then $f^{-1}(\text{RO}(Y))\subseteq \text{RO}(X)$ is not true in general (see comments below). Thus I want to restrict to continuous open maps.

In $\Bbb R^2,$ however, their boundaries aren't disjoint. $A,B\subseteq\Bbb R^2$ bounded because the stripes $A=\{(x,y)\in\Bbb R^2\mid 0\le x\le 2\}$ and $B=\{(x,y)\in\Bbb R^2\mid 1\le x\le 3\}$ is a counterexample. $A,B\subseteq\Bbb R^2$ convex because $A=\{x\in\Bbb R^2\mid 0\le\|x\|\le 2\}$ and $B=\{x\in\Bbb R^2\mid 1\le\|x\|\le 3\}$ is a counterexample.

I have a solution, but I don't think it holds enough water yet, so I was hoping to get some feedback by posting it here. First, some (perhaps strange) definitions (for simplicity we will assume that everything is in regards to locally compact metric spaces): A fixed point $p$ of a continuous map $f$ is called topologically attracting if it has a neighbourhood $U$ in which the iterates $f^n$ are all defined on $U$ and the sequence $\{f^n|_U\}$ converges uniformly to the constant map $U \to \{p\}$ . A fixed point $p$ of a continuous map $f$ is called topologically repelling if it has a neighbourhood $U$ so that for all $x \neq p$ in $U$ , there exists some $n \geq 1$ such that $f^n(x) \notin U.$ Hence, the only infinite orbit that completely lies in $U$ is the orbit of the fixed point itself. The problem that I am attempting is as follows: Let $f: (X, d) \to (X, d)$ be a continuous map on a locally compact metric space with fixed point $p$ . Suppose that $f$ maps a compact neighbourhood $K$ of $p$ homeomorphically onto a compact neighbourhood $K'$ . Then the restriction $f: K \to K'$ is topologically repelling at $p$ if and only if its inverse $g: K' \to K$ is topologically attracting at $p$ . I believe I have the forward direction, but the backwards direction seems to escape me. This is what I have tried (feedback is much appreciated)! ( $\impliedby$ ) Suppose that $g$ is topologically attracting at $p$ , and suppose for a contradiction that $f$ is not topologically repelling. Because $g$ is topologically attracting, there exists a compact neighbourhood $N' \subseteq K'$ of $p$ such that the iterates $\{g^n\}$ converge uniformly on $N'$ to the constant map $N' \to \{p\}$ . Since $f$ is not topologically repelling, then for every compact neighbourhood $N \subseteq K'$ of $p$ , there exists $x_0 \neq p$ in $N$ such that for all $n \geq 1$ , $f^n(x_0) \in N$ . Take $N = N'$ . Then after passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $f^n(x_0)$ converges to some limit $\hat{x}_0 \in N'$ , for $N'$ is compact in a metric space. Next, fix $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Then as the iterates $g^m$ uniformly converges, we have \begin{equation*} \lim_{m \to \infty} d(g^m(f^n(x_0)), p) = 0. \end{equation*} Moreover, we may interchange limits to obtain \begin{align*} 0 ={} & \lim_{n \to \infty} \lim_{m \to \infty} d(g^m(f^n(x_0)), p) 																				\\ ={} & \lim_{m \to \infty} \lim_{n \to \infty} d(g^m(f^n(x_0)), p) 																				\\ ={} & \lim_{m \to \infty} d(g^m(\hat{x}_0), p), \end{align*} where the last equality follows from continuity of $g^m$ . Hence, for sufficiently large $m$ , we have $g^m(\hat{x}_0) = p = g^m(p)$ , which by injectivity implies that $\hat{x}_0 = p$ . Thus, $f^n(x_0) \to p$ as $n \to \infty$ . But since $p$ is a fixed point of $f$ , we also have that $f^n(x_0) = f^n(p)$ for sufficiently large $n$ . Therefore, $x_0 = p$ by injectivity of $f$ , a contradiction.

The example of the translation representation of $\mathbb R$ in $L^2({\mathbb{R}})$","Complete reducibility, in linear algebra versus topology. The example of the translation representation of  in",\mathbb R L^2({\mathbb{R}}),"On page 2 of these notes , the author provides an example of how a topologically reducible representation of a group can be lacking topological irreducibles. Before asking questions, I offer a simple introduction. INTRODUCTION Consider the representation of $\mathbb R$ on $L^2({\mathbb R})$ by translations $  f(x)\;\longmapsto\;f(x\,+\,a)  $ written as $$  {\mathbb{R}} \ni a\;:\quad f\;\longmapsto\;f\circ\hat{\cal{R}}_a\;\;.  $$ An ${L^2({\mathbb R})}$ function can be Fourier-expanded as $$  f(x)\,=\int e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, x}\, \hat{f}(t)\,dt\;\;.\qquad\qquad\qquad (*)  $$ Since $\,f \in {L^2({\mathbb R})}\,\Longrightarrow\,\hat{\cal{R}}_a\, f \in {L^2({\mathbb R})}\,$ , we can expand also the function $f\circ\hat{\cal{R}}_a\, (x) =f(x+a)\,$ : $$  f(x\,+\, a)\,=\,\int e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, x}\, \hat{f}_a(t)\,dt\;\;.  $$ On the other hand, the insertion of $\, x+a\,$ instead of $\, x\,$ in (*) renders us $$  f(x+a)\,=\int e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, x}\, e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\, \hat{f}(t)\,dt\;\;.  $$ The former and the latter formulae, together, are indicating that the Fourier transform establishes an isomorphism between the translation representation of $\mathbb R$ on $L^2({\mathbb{R}})$ and the representation realised by multiplication by exponentials: $$  f(x)\,\longmapsto\,f(x\,+\, a)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \hat{f}(t)\,\longmapsto\,e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\, \hat{f}(t)\;\;,\qquad\qquad\qquad (**)  $$ so the Fourier transforms of $f$ and $f\circ\hat{\cal{R}}_a$ have the same support. By Schur's lemma, an irreducible, if it exists, must be one-dimensional. This means that there is such a $t$ that (*) becomes $$  f(x)\,= e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, x}\, \hat{f}(t)\;\;.  $$ while (**) becomes $$  f(x+a)\,= e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, x}\, e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\, \hat{f}(t)\;\;.  $$ Combined, these two expressions yield: $$  f(x+a)\,= \, e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\,f(x)\;\;.\qquad\qquad\qquad (***)  $$ Such a function, however, will not be residing in $L^2({\mathbb{R }})$ . Indeed, equality (***) enables us to write the squared norm $\,||\,f\,||^2\,=\,\int dx\,|f(x)|^2$ as $$  ||\,f\,||^2\,=\,\int da\,|\,e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\,f(0)\,|^2\,=\,|\,f(0)\,|^2\,\int da\,|\,e^{\, 2\,\pi\, i\, t\, a}\,|^2\,=\;\infty\;\;.  $$ So the representation of $\mathbb R$ on $L^2({\mathbb{R}})$ lacks topological irreducibles. At the same time, this representation is topologically reducible because it is said in these notes that, for any measurable set $S\subset\mathbb R$ , the vector space of functions $f$ for which $\hat{f}$ has support in $S$ gives an invariant closed subspace. QUESTION 1. Is there an elementary proof of the said fact that, for any measurable $S\subset\mathbb R$ , the space of functions $f$ for which $\hat{f}$ has support in $S$ is an invariant closed subspace? Since $f$ and $f\circ{\cal{R}}_a$ have the same support, the invariance holds, and the issue is closedness. To prove it, can we somehow use the fact that the Fourier transform is an isometry? QUESTION 2. Would it be right to say that the representation is completely reducible algebraically, but not topologically? To put it simply, can we say that the sole exponentials, not being topological irreducibles, still can be regarded as algebraic irreducibles? QUESTION 3. Below come two definitions of complete reducibility.  Equivalent in linear algebra and in finite-dimensional topological vector spaces, they are not necessarily equivalent in infinite dimensions. Consider a representation A(G) of a group G is a TVS (topological vector space). $\quad$ Def 1 $\quad$ A(G) is topologically completely reducible if it splits into a (finite or infinite) direct sum of topological irreducibles. $\quad$ Def 2 $\quad$ A(G) is topologically completely reducible if any of its topological subrepresentations has a complementary topological subrepresentation. The representation of $\mathbb{R}$ on $L^2({\mathbb{R}})$ evidently does not satisfy Def 1. (This representation simply lacks topological irreducibles.) Since for any measurable $S\subset\mathbb R$ the space of functions $f$ for which $\hat{f}$ has support in $S$ is an invariant closed subspace, may we claim that the representation of $\mathbb{R}$ on $L^2({\mathbb{R}})$ satisfies Def 2  (and is completely reducible in the sense of this Def)?

Is it true that $\mathrm{Iso}(X)$ is locally compact when endowed with the compact-open topology (or, equivalently, the topology of uniform convergence on compact subset of $X$ )? I am not particularly sure how to see if this is true or not. I know that if $X$ is a proper metric space (i.e. closed balls are compact) then $\mathrm{Iso}(X)$ is indeed locally compact.

The same argument works for an arbitrary isometry (not necessarily the identity map).

42,Relation between Morse number and Heegaard number,Relation between Morse number and Heegaard number,,"Given a closed 3-manifold $M$ , a self-indexing Morse function $f:M\to[0,3]$ produces a Heegaard splitting by : $$M=f^{-1}([0,3/2])\cup f^{-1}([3/2,3]).$$ ( This question discussed a bit on the topic.) Now, we define : Definition : Let $M$ be a closed 3-manifold. The Morse number $\mathfrak{m}(M)$ of $M$ is the minimal number of critical points of Morse functions. The Heegard number $\mathfrak{h}(M)$ of $M$ is the smallest genus of any Heegard splitting of $M$ . We have a theorem that Milnor used to create exotic spheres : Theorem : (Reeb) Let $M$ be a closed $n$ -manifold such that $\mathfrak{m}(M)=2$ . Then $M$ is a topological $n$ -sphere. Moreover, by a result from Alexander, we have that $\mathbb{S}^3$ is the only manifold whose Heegaard number is $0$ , that is we have, for a closed 3-manifold : $$\mathfrak{h}(M)=0\iff\mathfrak{m}(M)=2\iff M\cong\mathbb{S}^3.$$ This suggests that the two may be related. My questions are the following : Are $\mathfrak{m}(M)$ and $\mathfrak{h}(M)$ related ? Given a self-indexing Morse function $f:M\to[0,3]$ , is the genus of the associated Heegaard splitting related to the number of critical points of $f$ ? About the first question, I am wondering whether there is a somewhat- nice formula, like a linear relation $\mathfrak{m}(M)=A\mathfrak{h}(M)+B$ ? About the second question, I found no literature about this construction for a Heegaard splitting, the one I knew about was using Moise's triangulation theorem. As a side note, about the first question, if a linear relation existed, taking $M=\mathbb{S}^3$ or $\mathbb{S}^1\times\mathbb{S}^2$ would yield (unless I made mistakes in my computations) $\mathfrak{m}(M)=2[\mathfrak{h}(M)+1]$ . However, I didn't manage to compute the two numbers for a 3-torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ to check whether there is a contradiction. In any case, a polynomial relation $\mathfrak{m}(M)=P(\mathfrak{h}(M))$ would be respectable ! Edit : I've been reading some stuff here and there, and I have noticed : Given a self-indexing Morse function $f:M\to[0,3]$ , assuming that there are only one index zero and one index three critical points , then the genus of the associated Heegaard splitting is $g=\# f^{-1}(1)$ the number of index one critical points. It is always possible to construct a Morse function satisfying the hypotheses of the previous bullet. However, my concern is that the function constructed this way is not necessarily minimal (in the sense that its number of critical points is not necessarily the Morse number of the manifold). Moreover, this construction is certainly not natural. At last, I am not sure that given a self-indexing Morse function $f:M\to[0,3]$ , the construction of the new Morse function $\tilde{f}:M\to[0,3]$ with $\# f^{-1}(0)=\# f^{-1}(3)=1$ preserves the total number of critical points -- I haven't yet looked at the very details of this construction (see Milnor, Lectures on the h- cobordism theorem ).

43,Construct the smallest graph homeomorphic to a given graph by smoothing,Construct the smallest graph homeomorphic to a given graph by smoothing,,"The homeomorphism class $ \mathcal{H}(G) $ of a graph $G$ is the set of isomorphism classes of graphs that are topologically homeomorphic to $G$ . It is natural to ask: Is there a ""smallest"" representative in the homeomorphism class? If yes, how to find it? Unfortunately, I found no useful result on this problem after a quick google search. Nevertheless, guided by intuition, I have the following hypothesis: The smallest graph homeomorphic to a graph is obtained by smoothing every maximal ear. In this post I attempt to sketch a proof, but there is a gap in the proof, so I don't know whether my hypothesis is actually correct. I would appreciate anyone for pointing out my mistakes and filling out the gap. Warning: this would be a long post First, let's clear up some terminology. The term ""ear"" means different things in different graph theory textbooks. In this post, we adopt the following definition: Definition 1 An ear in a graph is either: a cycle whose all except possibly one vertices are of degree $2$ , or a path whose all internal vertices are of degree $2$ . A maximal ear is an ear that is not a proper subgraph of a larger ear. Equivalently, a maximal ear is one of the following: a cycle that is a whole connected component on its own a cycle in which exactly one vertex is of degree $ \geq 3 $ , while all other vertices are of degree $2$ a path in which all internal vertices are of degree $2$ , while both end vertices are of degree $ \neq 2 $ Two common operations that preserve topology on graphs are subdividing and smoothing: Definition 2 Subdividing an edge means replacing it by an ear. More precisely, let $e = uv$ be an edge. If $u = v$ , then subdividing the self-loop $e$ means replacing it by a cycle $C$ , and $u = v$ becomes a vertex on $C$ , which may or may not have degree $2$ , depending on whether $e$ is isolated. On the other hand, if $u \neq v$ , then subdividing $e$ means replacing it by a path $P$ , and $u, v$ become the end vertices of $P$ . Subdividing a graph means preforming a sequence of subdividing on edges. Definition 3 Smoothing an ear means replacing it by a single edge. More precisely, let $C$ be an ear. If $C$ is a cycle, then smoothing $C$ means replacing it by a self-loop $e$ , and the vertex of degree $ \neq 2 $ on $C$ becomes the only vertex incident on $e$ (if all vertices on $C$ are of degree $2$ , just choose any vertex). On the other hand, If $C$ is actually a path $P$ , then smoothing $P$ means replacing it by a loopless edge $e$ , and the end vertices of $P$ become the end vertices of $e$ . Smoothing a graph means preforming a sequence of smoothing on ears. Next, we have the following classic result on topology of graphs: Theorem 1 Two graphs are homeomorphic if and only if one of them can be obtained from a sequence of subdividing and smoothing operations on the another. Proof: See this post . Theorem 2 Let $G$ and $H$ be two homeomorphic graphs. Then $ |V(G)| = |V(H)| $ if and only if $ |E(G)| = |E(H)| $ . Sketch of proof: Subdividing (resp. smoothing) always increases (resp. decreases) the number of vertices and edges by the same number. $\square$ In light of Theorem 2, we can define an ordering on the homeomorphism class of a graph: Definition 4 Let $ \mathcal{H}(G) $ be the homeomorphism class of a graph $G$ . Define the ordering $\preceq$ on $ \mathcal{H}(G) $ by: $$ G_1 \preceq G_2 \iff |V(G_1)| \leq |V(G_2)| $$ for any $ G_1, G_2 \in \mathcal{H}(G) $ . If $ G_1 \preceq G_2 $ and $ G_2 \preceq G_1 $ , then we denote $ G_1 \sim G_2 $ . The ordering $\preceq$ is a total preorder, meaning it is transitive and any two homeomorphic graphs are comparable. Unfortunately it is not a total order, since $ G_1 \sim G_2 $ does not imply $ G_1, G_2 $ are isomorphic, even through Theorem 2 implies $ |E(G_1)| = |E(G_2)| $ . Theorem 3 Any graph without isolated vertex can be uniquely decomposed into an edge-disjoint union of maximal ears. Sketch of proof: Let $G$ be a graph without isolated vertex. Define the relation $R$ on $E(G)$ by: $$ eRf \iff \exists \text{ ear } C \subseteq{G} \text{ s.t. } e, f \in E(C) $$ for any $ e, f \in E(G) $ . Then $R$ is an equivalence relation on $E(G)$ , in which each equivalence class contains the edges of exactly one maximal ear. Thus, $R$ induces a decomposition of $G$ into an edge-disjoint union of maximal ears. Conversely, any such decomposition must be induced by $R$ , so the decomposition is unique. $\square$ Based on the above decomposition, we can define the following: Definition 5 A graph without isolated vertex is called smooth if every maximal ear is of length $1$ . For a graph $G$ without isolated vertex, the smooth graph obtained from smoothing every maximal ear in $G$ is denoted as $ \text{Smooth} (G) $ . The term ""smooth graph"" is not standard, but I could not find any existing term for such a graph, so I just make it up on my own. Theorem 4 Let $G$ be a smooth graph without isolated vertex and $ H \in \mathcal{H}(G) $ , then $ G \preceq H $ . Moreover, $ G \sim H $ if and only if $H$ is a smooth graph. Sketch of proof: By Theorem 1, $H$ can obtained from a sequence of subdividing and smoothing operations on $G$ . Each step of the operations can only change one of the maximal ear to another maximal ear of possibly different length. On the other hand, in a smooth graph all the maximal ears already have the shortest possible length (namely, $1$ ), so any sequence of subdividing and smoothing can never further decrease the number of vertices. Thus, $ |V(G)| \leq |V(H)| $ and the equality holds if and only if $H$ is smooth. $\square$ The following claim is based on intuition, but I don't know how to prove it. It is where the gap of my whole proof lies. Claim 0 Let $G$ and $H$ be two smooth graphs without isolated vertex. If they are homeomorphic, then they are isomorphic. Finally, assuming the above claim, we can prove the main hypothesis: Main Hypothesis Assume Claim 0 is correct and let $G$ be a graph without isolated vertex. Then $ \text{Smooth} (G) $ is the unique smallest graph in $ \mathcal{H} (G) $ with respect to the ordering $ \preceq $ . Proof: The fact that $ \text{Smooth} (G) \preceq H $ for all $ H \in \mathcal{H} (G) $ follows from Theorem 4. To prove uniqueness, let $ H \in \mathcal{H} (G) $ be such that $ \text{Smooth} (G) \sim H $ . Since $ \text{Smooth} (G) $ is smooth and $ H \in \mathcal{H} (\text{Smooth} (G)) $ , by Theorem 4, $H$ is smooth as well. Claim 0 then implies $H$ is isomorphic to $ \text{Smooth} (G) $ . $\square$ Questions: Is Claim 0 correct? How to prove it? Even if Claim 0 is wrong, is my main hypothesis still correct? Are there any other mistakes in my proof?

In this case and if vector fields along $\partial M$ are defined with domain $M$ (see question 1), an outward-pointing vector field is not necessarily a vector field along $\partial M$ .

In this case, an outward-pointing vector field necessarily is a vector field along $\partial M$ , by definition of outward-pointing vector field regardless of the domain defined for a vector field along $\partial M$ (see question 1). Choice 4: other In the proof of Proposition 22.10, is it understood that we cover $\partial M$ by restrictions of the $(U_{\alpha}, x^1_{\alpha}, ..., x^n_{\alpha})$ 's like in questions 2 and 3? (i'll repeat below, so this question will be self-contained.) Namely: 1. Consider each $p \in \partial M$ . 2. View $p \in M$ . 3. Obtain a $(U_p, x^1_p, ..., x^n_p)$ for each $p$ . 4. Restrict the $(U_p, x^1_p, ..., x^n_p)$ 's to $U_p \cap \partial M$ to get $(U_p \cap \partial M, x^1_p|{U_p \cap \partial M}, ..., x^n_p|_{U_p \cap \partial M})$ . 5. Since $\partial M$ is Lindelöf since all manifolds without boundary are Lindelöf, we can get a countable subcollection of the $(U_p, x^1_p, ..., x^n_p)$ 's to restrict to $U_p \cap \partial M$ . There are also other ways to cover $\partial M$ . (If $\partial M$ were compact, then we could have a finite subcollection) Hence we have that the cover is indexed "" $\alpha$ "" in some index set $A$ ( $\alpha \in A$ ) instead of specifically by $p$ in $\partial M$ . Update : I think the answer is negative. But here I assume that Tu is following the same convention as Munkres (this is the convention introduced in the section on compact spaces): For a topological space $X$ , $\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a cover (an open cover) of $X$ if $X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_{\alpha}$ and $U_{\alpha}$ 's are subsets (open subsets) of $X$ . For a topological subspace $Y \subseteq X$ , we still have that $\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a cover (an open cover) of $Y$ if $Y = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} V_{\alpha}$ and $V_{\alpha}$ 's are subsets (open subsets) of $Y$ But we have that $\{W_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a cover (an open cover) of $Y$ by subsets (open subsets) of $X$ if $Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} W_{\alpha}$ and $W_{\alpha}$ 's are subsets (open subsets) of $X$ . Therefore, it is correct that we do not expect $\partial M = \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_{\alpha}$ , but we still say $\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ is a cover of $\partial M$ because $\partial M \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} U_{\alpha}$ and $U_{\alpha}$ 's are subsets of $M$ Actually, based on Lee's Problem 8-4 (mentioned here ), I think we can interpret Proposition 22.10 without the concept of ""along"" as follows: On a manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$ , there is a smooth vector field $X$ on $M$ such that each $X_p$ is outward-pointing for $p \in \partial M$ .

67,topology induced by function from set to power set?,topology induced by function from set to power set?,,"tl;dr: I've tried to construct a different way to formalize ""topological spaces"" than via open sets or neighborhoods. I have not seen this approach but it may have been done before. The definition as it currently stands is not satisfactory (see discussion below). t-topologies Consider a pair $(X,t)$ where $t:X\to \mathcal P(\mathcal P(X))$ , i.e. $t(x)\subseteq \mathcal P (X)$ (which intuitively gives for every $x$ the set of subsets of $X$ that ""x touches"") satisfies the following axiom: Axiom 1 . For any $x\in X$ and any $U\subseteq S\subseteq X$ , if $U\in t(x)$ then $S\in t(x)$ . (intuitively, if $x$ ""touches"" the set $U$ , then it also touches the same set with arbitrary additions to it). Axiom 2 . For any $x\in X$ and any $U,V\subseteq X$ , if $U,V\notin t(x)$ then $U\cup V\notin t(x)$ (easily extended to infinite unions). (intuitively, if $x$ doesn't touch either of the sets $U,V$ , then it also doesn't touch the combined set). Call this pair $(X,t)$ a "" touch-topology "" or ""t-topology"" (because they're defined via ""touch-relations"" rather than open sets). Such a pair induces a topology: $(X,T)$ , where $U\in T$ iff $\forall x\in U, U^c\notin t(x)$ . (Intuitively, a set is open if none of its members touch anything outside the set). Indeed this is a topology: the empty set obviously is in $T$ . for any $U_i\in T$ , we know that for all $x\in U_i$ , $U_i^c\notin t(x)$ , therefore since $(\bigcup _j U_j)^c\subseteq U_i^c$ we have $(\bigcup _j U_j)^c \notin t(x)$ by axiom 1. (intuitively, if $x$ touches nothing outside $U_i$ , then it also doesn't touch anything outside $\bigcup_j U_j$ ). for any $U,V\in T$ , we know that for any $x\in U\cap V$ we have $U^c\notin t(x)$ and $V^c \notin t(x)$ . Hence by axiom 2, $U^c\cup V^c = (U \cap V)^c\notin t(x)$ . Hence $U \cap V\in T$ . (easily extended to infinite intersections). Definition . Let $\mathcal X=(X,t_X)$ , $\mathcal Y=(Y,t_Y)$ be t-topologies. A function $f:X\to Y$ is touch-continuous at $x$ if for all $U\in t_X(x)$ it holds that $f(U) \in t_Y(f(y))$ . (intuitively, a function is touch-continuous if it doesn't change the things that a point touches). Theorem. Let $\mathcal X= (X,t_X), \mathcal Y = (Y,t_Y)$ be touch-topologies. If a function $f:X \to Y$ is t-continuous at $x$ then it is also ""classically"" continuous at $x$ in the topologies $(X,T_X), (Y,T_Y)$ induced by $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal Y$ . proof. Assume $U\in T_Y$ (an open set). We must show that $f^{-1}(U)\in T_X$ . Since $U\in T_Y$ , we know that for all $y\in U$ , $U^c\notin t_Y(y)$ . Hence by t-continuity, $f^{-1}(U^c)\notin t_X(x)$ for all $x\in f^{-1}(U)$ . Hence $f^{-1}(U)\in T_X$ . I don't think we can show that continuity implies t-continuity, though I'm not sure. What's missing from this approach. My intention with this was to represent a topology according to the sets that an object ""touches"", rather than according to ""open sets"" (i.e. sets whose elements don't touch the outside). This approach is similar to the ""neighborhood"" definition of topology. However, my approach is not complete, in the sense that we cannot turn any arbitrary topology into a unique t-topology. That is, for any topology, there are multiple t-topologies (non-isomorphic) that induce that topology: for example, consider the topology induced by a directed graph $(X,R)$ ( $R$ is a relation on $X$ denoting the arrows of the graph), where the t-topology is: given a node $x$ , $U\in t_X(x)$ iff $U$ contains at least one node $y$ such that $Rxy$ . It is not hard to show that the t-topology of the transitive closure of any graph induces the same topology as the t-topology of the graph itself.

(We read $x \lessdot A$ as "" $x$ touches $A$ "".) The touch relation $\lessdot$ must satisfy the following axioms: No element of $X$ touches the empty set. If $x \in A$ , then $x \lessdot A$ . If $x \lessdot (A \cup B)$ , then $x \lessdot A$ or $x \lessdot B$ . If $x \lessdot A$ and every element of $A$ touches $B$ , then $x \lessdot B$ . This definition is equivalent to the usual definition via open sets and better captures the intuition that a topology on a set specifies which points are ""infinitesimally close"" to each other. It also makes a lot of definitions conceptually easier: for example, $f: X \to Y$ is continuous iff $x \lessdot A \implies f(x) \lessdot f(A)$ . Question: Can the definitions of compact spaces and proper maps be reformulated in terms of a touch relation in a simple way, similar in spirit to the definition of continuity above? Of course, it's possible to define open sets in terms of a touch relation ( $A \subseteq X$ is open iff no point of $A$ touches $X \setminus A$ ) and then restate the usual definition of compactness, but I have a suspicion that something simpler ought to be possible. The definition of continuity above is a lot shorter than ""the inverse image under $f$ of every set whose points do not touch its complement is itself a set whose points do not touch its complement."" Proper maps, in particular, have a nice intuitive characterization (faraway points are sent to faraway points) that seems compatible with the structure of a touch relation. (Note that $x \not\lessdot A \implies f(x) \not\lessdot f(A)$ doesn't work. Sigmoid functions $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ have this property but are not proper.)

Unfortunately, Gauld does not state his definition, and I can't find any reference to it elsewhere.

I suspect there's a simpler way to think about it though. P.S. I'm just a dumb physicist without much background in advanced math.

Using the fact that $d(A,B) = 0$, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we may obtain $a_n \in A$ and $b_n \in B$ such that $d(a_n,b_n) < \frac1n$.

From the compactness of $X$ we obtain a subsequence $(a_{n_k})_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ of $(a_n)$ which converges to some point $a \in X$. We know that in fact $a \in A$ because $A$ is closed. Now the claim is that $a \in A \cap B$. To show this, it is sufficient to show that $a \in \overline{B}$.

89,Are quaternions useful as coordinate systems for two-dimensional manifolds?,Are quaternions useful as coordinate systems for two-dimensional manifolds?,,"I am learning how quaternions work. For that reason I have prepared a coordinate system based on quaternions applied to two-dimensional topological manifolds of the shape of a Klein bottle (it can be adapted easily to others like a Möbius strip, or a torus for instance). Basically we can represent the Klein bottle by its gluing diagram : And we will add extra information to the points that ""inhabit"" the surface of the manifold. A point of the surface will be represented by a quaternion as follows: $$a+bi+cj+dk$$ Where: $a$ represents the side. Any point of the surface of the bottle has an equivalent point in the internal side, so $a = 0,1$ ( $0$ outer side, $1$ inner side). A point can be in some of the both inner or outer sides. $i$ represents the horizontal position $x$ in the gluing diagram ( $i \in [0,I]$ where $I$ is the length of the Klein bottle diagram) $j$ represents the vertical position $y$ in the gluing diagram ( $i \in [0,J]$ where $J$ is the height of the Klein bottle diagram) Finally, $k$ will be an extra property of the point, in my case I named it the ""spin"", it has $4$ positions, ( $k \in [0,3]$ ). I could be seen as a kind of local orientation associated to the gluing diagram (North,South,East,West). This provides a coordinate system with sum and multiplication. As we are using quaternions, the standard rules of quaternions are applied: $$i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$$ Addition, scalar multiplication and quaternion multiplication are available and the quaternion multiplication rotation laws hold: $$ij=k, ji=-k, jk=i, kj=-i, ki=j, ik=-j$$ The Hamilton product is defined as the standard one: $$(a_1+b_1i+c_1j+d_1k)\cdot(a_2+b_2i+c_2j+d_2k) = (a1a2-b1b2-c1c2-d1d2)+(a1b2+b1a2+c1d2-d1c2)i+(a1c2-b1d2+c1a2+d1b2)j+(a1d2+b1c2-c1b2+d1a2)k$$ To visualize how the points move along the Klein bottle, let us define a collision game.

Are there documented references of this kind of application? (quaternions applied as coordinate systems to topological manifolds). Any insights are very appreciated.","I am learning how quaternions work. For that reason I have prepared a coordinate system based on quaternions applied to two-dimensional topological manifolds of the shape of a Klein bottle (it can be adapted easily to others like a Möbius strip, or a torus for instance). Basically we can represent the Klein bottle by its gluing diagram : And we will add extra information to the points that ""inhabit"" the surface of the manifold. A point of the surface will be represented by a quaternion as follows: Where: represents the side. Any point of the surface of the bottle has an equivalent point in the internal side, so ( outer side, inner side). A point can be in some of the both inner or outer sides. represents the horizontal position in the gluing diagram ( where is the length of the Klein bottle diagram) represents the vertical position in the gluing diagram ( where is the height of the Klein bottle diagram) Finally, will be an extra property of the point, in my case I named it the ""spin"", it has positions, ( ). I could be seen as a kind of local orientation associated to the gluing diagram (North,South,East,West). This provides a coordinate system with sum and multiplication. As we are using quaternions, the standard rules of quaternions are applied: Addition, scalar multiplication and quaternion multiplication are available and the quaternion multiplication rotation laws hold: The Hamilton product is defined as the standard one: To visualize how the points move along the Klein bottle, let us define a collision game.

I have to prove that $\mathcal{E}$ is compact for the product topology. My idea is to prove that $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N^2}$ is compact and $\mathcal{E}$ is closed in this compact. By Tychonoff's theorem the set $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N^2}$ is compact (I think that $\{0,1\}$ has the Borel-Lebesgue property so it's compact). Now, I have no idea to prove that $\mathcal{E}$ is closed (which argument could I use ?).

99,Composition preserves homotopy,Composition preserves homotopy,,"I have to prove that, given continuous functions between topological spaces $f,g:X\to Y$ and $h,k:Y\to Z$, we have $$f\simeq g,\quad h\simeq k\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad hf\simeq kg.$$ I would like to ask if the following proof is correct. Since $f\simeq g$ and $h\simeq k$, there exist continuous functions $$\varphi:X\times I\to Y\qquad\text{and}\qquad\psi:Y\times I\to Z,$$ with $I=[0,1]$ the euclidean interval, such that $$\begin{cases} \varphi(x,0)=f(x)\\ \varphi(x,1)=g(x) \end{cases} \qquad\text{and}\qquad \begin{cases} \psi(y,0)=h(y)\\ \psi(y,1)=k(y) \end{cases}$$ for all $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$. Define $\tau:X\times I\to Z$ like this: $$\tau(x,t)=\psi\big(\varphi(x,t),t\big).$$ Then $\tau$ should be continuous and such that $$\begin{cases} \tau(x,0)=hf(x)\\ \tau(x,1)=kg(x), \end{cases}$$ so it should be a homotopy $\tau:hf\simeq kg$. Is this proof OK or did I get something wrong?
