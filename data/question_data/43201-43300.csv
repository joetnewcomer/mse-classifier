I then noticed that I can show that $\mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{q}\right)=\mathbb{Q}\left(q\right)$. That didn't lead me anywhere interesting, either. I tried many different variations on these themes. Eventually, I got the sense that I wasn't able to arrive at a contradiction because none of my attempts really use the particular ""structure"" of the polynomial whose existence I was trying to disprove. Instead, my solutions depended on a too abstractly defined field extensions. That is, while I was playing with field extension of the form $K(q)$ or $K(\sqrt{q})$, the operations I tried on them didn't take into consideration the actual definition of $q$, which was derived from the given polynomial $x^2+y^2+z^2+1$. When I tried to develop this line of thought, I got stuck again. At this point, I feel I developed a mental block regarding this question. In my desperation, I even tried to prove the proposition, rather than disprove it. It didn't work. I'd love a nudge in the right direction. A hint, preferably not a subtle one.

I tried to start the proof like this: Let $t$ be the number of involutions of the group $G$ . Take an arbitrary involution $g\in S$ . Then $$C_{G}(g) = S \Rightarrow t \geq \frac{|G|}{|C_{G}(g)|} = \frac{|G|}{q}.$$ It's not difficult to understand that in the group $G$ there are only involutions and elements of odd order. Indeed, let $x$ be an element of even order unequal to $2$ . Let $|x| = k$ . Then $x^{\frac{k}{2}}$ is an involution and $C_{G}(x^{\frac{k}{2}})$ is an elementary Abelian Sylow $2$ -subgroup of $G$ . But $x\in C_{G}(x^{\frac{k}{2}})$ is a contradiction. $\textbf{Question №1:}$ how to prove that the number of involutions are exactly $\frac{|G|}{q}$ ? It's clear that it's enough, taking into account the arguments presented above, to count the various elements of all the Sylow $2$ -subgroups. But as for me, it's quite difficult. To understand why $\nu_{2}(\chi) = 1\; \forall\;\chi\in \operatorname{Irr}(G)$ it's enough to show that $\nu_{2}(\chi) > 0 \; \forall\;\chi\in \operatorname{Irr}(G).$ Let's say we proved that the number of involutions is exactly $\frac{|G|}{q}.$ Let $\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G).$ Then $$\nu_2(\chi) = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum\limits_{g \in G}\chi(g^{2}) = \frac{1}{|G|}(\frac{|G|}{q} + 1)\chi(1) + \frac{1}{|G|}\sum\limits_{g \in G; |g| > 2}\chi(g^{2}).$$ Since $G$ is a simple group, then $Z(\chi) = Z(G/\ker\chi)= Z(G) = 1.$ This means that only an unit element can correspond to a diagonal matrix. $\textbf{Question №2:}$ How to prove using the above facts that $\nu_{2}(\chi) >0$ ?
