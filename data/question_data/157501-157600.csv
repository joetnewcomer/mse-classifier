2,Writing real numbers as sum of reciprocals,Writing real numbers as sum of reciprocals,,"I want to rigorously prove that given any $x\geq 0$, we can write $x=\sum_{k\in J} \frac{1}{k}$ for some $J\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ eg. $2=\sum \frac{1}{2^{k}}$. Also, for what other $\{a_{k}\geq 0\}$ is that true (any theorems?)? For example, it fails for $a_{k}=\frac{1}{k!}$: Writing number as sum of reciprocals of factorial Another possible $\{a_{k}\}$ collection is $\mathbb{N}\cup \{\frac{1}{2^{n}}\}$. For conditionally convergent we have the Riemann series theorem but in our case $\sum a_{k}$ is not even conditionally convergent. Anyhow back to proving it for reciprocals. So there is a bunch of algorithms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm_for_Egyptian_fractions and a proof of what I want in ""The Approximation of Numbers as Sums of Reciprocals"". But the proof there is a bit too wordy for me. I bet if I sit down I can flesh it out completely. Attempt 1)First for rationals $\frac{x}{y}$, we split into $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{1}{\lceil y/x\rceil}+\frac{(-y)\bmod x}{y\lceil y/x\rceil}$, then repeat for $\frac{(-y)\bmod x}{y\lceil y/x\rceil}$ and the result follows by induction on x ($x=1$ and then $x>1$): $\frac{x+1}{y}-\frac{1}{\lceil y/x+1\rceil}=\frac{(x+1)\lceil y/x+1\rceil-y}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}\leq \frac{(x+1)( \frac{y-1}{x+1}+1)-y}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}=\frac{x}{y\lceil y/x+1\rceil}$. Thus, $(x+1)\lceil y/x+1\rceil-y<x$, for which the result is already true by IH. Then because any irrational (eg. decimal expansion) can be written as sum of rationals we are done.

I would appreciate it if someone could help me restate my observations in standard notation and help me understand my mistake. Here's my notation: $H_{p_i}(x)$ = the number of integers less than or equal to $x$ that are relatively prime to $p_i\#$ For example: $H_3(10) = 3 \left\{ 1,5,7 \right\}$ $H_5(30) = 8 \left\{ 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 \right\}$ I use this notation because if I assume $p_0 = 1$ and $H_1(x) = x$, I get: $H_{p_i}(x) = H_{p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ I also use this notation: $p_i\#_{-1} = (p_i -1)(p_{i-1}-1)(p_{i-2}-1)\dots(2-1)$ So that the standard primorial would be: $p_i\#_{0} = p_i\#$ And the number of pairs of $x,x+2$ that are relatively prime to $p_i\#$ and where $x < p_i\#$ is $p_i\#_{-2}$. So, I was reasoning about primorials using my notation as I normally do when I struck upon a simple formula for the lower bound for any $H_{p_i}$ Let me start with $H_2(x)$ which is easy to state in terms of an upper and lower bound: $\dfrac{x}{2} \le H_2(x) \le \dfrac{x+1}{2}$ Now, I would like to come up with a similar expression for $H_3(x)$ which gets overly complicated and unuseful if we approach it in the obvious way. So, I thought about using two different values: $H_{\text{min}\,3}(x)$ and $H_{\text{max}\,3}(x)$ which I derive in a simple way from $H_2(x)$: $H_{3}(x) = H_2(x) - H_2\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{3}\right\rfloor\right)$ $H_{\text{min}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{x}{2} - \dfrac{\frac{x}{3}-\left\{\frac{x}{3}\right\}+1}{2}$ $H_{\text{max}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{x+1}{2} - \dfrac{\frac{x}{3} -\left\{\frac{x}{3}\right\}}{2}$ so that I get the following upper and lower bounds: $\dfrac{2x-3}{6} \le H_{\text{min}\, 3}(x) \le \dfrac{2x-1}{6}$ $\dfrac{2x+3}{6} \le H_{\text{max}\, 3}(x) \le \dfrac{2x+5}{6}$ where $H_{\text{max}\,3}(x) \ge H_3(x) \ge H_{\text{min}\,3}(x)$ Let: $H_{\text{min}\, \text{low}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x-3}{6}$ $H_{\text{min}\, \text{high}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x-1}{6}$ $H_{\text{max}\, \text{low}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x+3}{6}$ $H_{\text{max}\, \text{high}\, 3}(x) = \dfrac{2x+5}{6}$ Then, I have the following: $H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x) = H_{\text{min}\, \text{low}\, p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{\text{min}\, \text{high}\, p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ $H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x) = H_{\text{max}\, \text{high}\, p_{i-1}}(x) - H_{\text{max}\, \text{low}\, p_{i-1}}\left(\left\lfloor\dfrac{x}{p_i}\right\rfloor\right)$ Using induction (see below for my logic), I was able to generalize this to: $\dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x - p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} \le H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x) \le \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x - p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#}$ $\dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} \le H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x) \le \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}x + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1}) + p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#}$ Using the results above, I attempt to analyze Legendre's Conjecture : Let $p_i$ be the largest prime less than or equal to $x$ $\pi(x^2 + 2x) - \pi(x^2) = H_{p_i}(x^2 + 2x) - H_{p_i}(x^2) \ge H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x^2+2x) - H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x^2)$ $H_{\text{min}\, p_i}(x^2+2x) - H_{\text{max}\, p_i}(x^2) \ge \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2+2x) - p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} - \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2) + p_i(p_{i-1}\#_{-1}) + p_i\#_{-1}}{p_i\#} =$ $= \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(x^2+2x -x^2) - (p_i + p_i + [p_i-1])(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} =$ $=  \dfrac{p_i\#_{-1}(2x) - (3p_i-1)(p_{i-1}\#_{-1})}{p_i\#} > \dfrac{(p_i-1)(2x) - (3p_i-1)}{p_i p_{i-1}}$ $\dfrac{(p_i-1)(2x) - (3p_i-1)}{p_i p_{i-1}} > \dfrac{2x-3}{p_i} \ge \dfrac{2x-3}{x} =2  -\dfrac{3}{x}$ which would suggest that Legendre's Conjecture is true for $x \ge 3$ This result is ridiculous given the primitiveness of my method.

What would be the most efficient method for doing such a proof? Working with specific numbers is quite difficult in a formal system, since proving that the number $n=((\dots(1+1)\dots+1)+1)$ is even a natural number requires $O(n)$ steps. Numbers up to 10 are defined this way in Metamath, and this style is convenient for its uniformity, which allows you to write a single inference schema $k\in\Bbb N\to k+1\in\Bbb N$ and apply it $n$ times to prove $n\in\Bbb N$. For large numbers, it becomes convenient to represent them in other forms, say $2^k+m$ where $k$ and $m$ are specified as above. Thus you could prove that such a large number is a natural number in only $O(k+m)$ steps, and more generally you could use a form of decimal notation, i.e. $a+10\cdot(b+10\cdot(c+10\cdot d)))$ to achieve $O(\log n)$ steps in the long run. This is how you would tackle the problem of proving closure for large numbers, but what is the most efficient way to prove primality? For the range I'm talking about (still ""small"" numbers as far as number theorists are concerned), the most efficient method is probably the sieve of Erastothenes, which builds up a complete list of all primes less than some number (so there is no avoiding at least $n$ assertions of the form $k\in\Bbb P$ or $k\notin\Bbb P$), and building the $n$-th assertion requires using at least the first $\sqrt n$ assertions, so we're looking at $O(n^{3/2})$ total steps in a proof that $n\in\Bbb P$. Is there any better approach here? The strength of the system is in proving general assertions once and reusing them to achieve better compression of this process, the same way a human would, so it's not necessarily as brain-dead as a computer verification, but since prime numbers are so erratic, I don't see how you could achieve much savings off the brute-force approach. In particular, I'd like to avoid too many assertions that certain numbers are composite , but it is usually not clear that certain number is composite unless it is a multiple of the base (assuming you are using the decimal notation described above). There is nothing stopping you from using whatever notational system is convenient for the given number, but then converting between systems is overhead. Any ideas? Note: I'm not asking for an actual proof here that some big number is prime, but rather an efficient approach to the problem, since the numbers involved are big enough that the big-O is going to dominate the overall length of the complete proof. The specifics of the Metamath system are also irrelevant, for the most part; what matters is that you can't just draw lines on a grid and take that as the proof, like one would do in a ""regular"" proof that a given number around 100 is prime.

Find the value of $a^{2020}+b^{2020}+c^{2020}$ . My approach: Let the other roots of $f(x)$ except $1$ be $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . This implies that the roots of $g(x)$ are $1,\alpha^2$ and $\beta^2$ . Thus, we have $1+\alpha+\beta=-a,$ $\alpha+\beta+\alpha\beta=b,$ $\alpha\beta=-c$ and $1+\alpha^2+\beta^2=-b,$ $\alpha^2+\beta^2+\alpha^2\beta^2=c,$ $\alpha^2\beta^2=-a.$ Note that thus we have $c^2=-a$ . Again, $$a^2=(1+\alpha+\beta)^2=1+\alpha^2+\beta^2+2(\alpha+\beta+\alpha\beta)=-b+2b=b.$$ Also, since $f(1)=0\implies a+b+c=-1$ . Now since we have $a=-c^2$ and $b=a^2\implies b=c^4,$ which in turn implies that $$-c^2+c^4+c+1=0\implies c^4-c^3+c^3-c^2+c-1=-2\\\implies (c^3+c^2+1)(c-1)=-2.$$ Thus, we either have $$\begin{cases}c^3+c^2+1=1\\ c-1=-2\end{cases} \text{ or }\begin{cases}c^3+c^2+1=-1\\ c-1=2\end{cases} \text{ or }\begin{cases}c^3+c^2+1=2\\ c-1=-1\end{cases} \text{ or }\begin{cases}c^3+c^2+1=-2\\ c-1=1\end{cases}.$$ Note that only the first diophantine equation yields a solution, that is $c=-1$ .

82,Ideals prime to the conductor in the ideal class group of an order,Ideals prime to the conductor in the ideal class group of an order,,"Let $K$ be a number field, $\mathcal{O}_K$ its ring of integers and $\mathcal{O}$ an order in $K$ . I'm going through the proof for the formula linking the cardinality of the class group $Cl(\mathcal{O})$ to that of the class group $Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ . I'm following the proof given here by Keith Conrad. At the end of page 11 he makes the following statement: From the proof that $Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ is surjective, we can represent each ideal class in $Cl(\mathcal{O})$ by an ideal $\mathfrak{b}$ of $\mathcal{O}$ which is relatively prime to the conductor $\mathfrak{c}$ and the fact that $Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ is surjective is Theorem 5.1, which uses the fact that the same statement is true in the maximal order $\mathcal{O}_K$ . However, although I can easily prove the statement for $\mathcal{O}_K$ using unique factorization and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, I can't really see how this implies that the same statement is true for $\mathcal{O}$ . From the proof of Theorem 5.1 I can see that every coset of the kernel of the map $\psi:Cl(\mathcal{O})\longrightarrow Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ contains a class verifying the statement (just take $\mathfrak{a}$ in any class of $Cl(\mathcal{O}_K)$ such that $\mathfrak{a}$ is prime to the conductor and consider $\mathfrak{a}\cap\mathcal{O}$ ), and if I could use the explicit description of $\ker(\psi)$ which Conrad gives soon after that statement, then the statement would follow easily, as is done here on MathOverflow. However this description depends on the statement itself, so we can't use it. So I guess I'm probably missing some trivial step, but I can't really see that, hence even hints are really appreciated. Edit: The statement in the question is also mentioned by Pete L. Clark here , in the last 3 lines. The reference is Neukirch, but I can't find this claim in his book. Moreover I'm wondering wheter this question is more appropriate for MathOverflow, since I've only seen this claim in MO posts so far. Edit 2: I've just found another claim which implies the aforementioned statement. It is Proposition 20.13 from these notes by Pete L. Clark: Let $R$ be a Dedekind domain, $I$ a fractional ideal of $R$ and $J$ a nonzero integral ideal of $R$ . Then there exists $a\in I$ such that $aI^{-1}+J=R$ . This is stated for Dedekind domains, but it seems to me that the proof given in the notes should still work even if $R$ is a non-maximal order, provided that we assume $I$ to be invertible. Indeed, using the same notations as in the original proof, there should be finitely many distinct prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,...,\mathfrak{p}_r$ containing $J$ , because if $\mathfrak{p}\supseteq J$ , then $\mathfrak{p}$ is minimal on $J$ , since $\dim R=1$ , and in a noetherian ring there are finitely many minimal prime ideals on each ideal. Moreover $I\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n\subsetneq I\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_{i-1}\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n$ for all $1\leq i\leq r$ , for otherwise, using the invertibility of $I$ , we would find $\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n=\mathfrak{p}_1\cdots\mathfrak{p}_{i-1}\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}\cdots\mathfrak{p}_n$ , and considering that these are comaximal ideals, this implies $\mathfrak{p}_i\supseteq\mathfrak{p}_j$ for some $j\neq i$ ,  which is clearly impossible. Then the rest of the proof should work without any modification. This is quite different from the proof I had found for the maximal order, since that proof relied too much on unique factorization to be extended to the non-maximal case. Although this should solve my question, I'm not closing it since I'm still interested in knowing if there is a way to prove the statement in non-maximal orders as a consequence of the fact that the same property holds true in the maximal order, which is what K. Conrad seemed to suggest in his notes. Moreover it would be nice if someone could confirm that what I wrote above is correct.","Let be a number field, its ring of integers and an order in .

Thus, the element $y \in (\mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z})^\times = \langle x \rangle$ can be written $y=x^a$ for a certain $a \geqslant 0$ . Moreover, we assumed that $y$ is a $k$ -th power modulo $p^\gamma$ , that is to say $y = (x^b)^k = x^{kb}$ for a certain $b \geqslant 0$ . So that we get $x^a = x^{kb}$ , that is finally $x^{a-kb} = 1$ . That is possible if and only if $\phi(n) \mid a - kb$ . By Bezout identity, this is equivalent to $(\phi(n), k) \mid a$ . Assume $n = p^t$ for a certain $t\geqslant \gamma$ . We have $\phi(n) = p^{t-1}(p-1)$ and $(\mathbf{Z}/p^t \mathbf{Z})^\times = \langle x \rangle$ for a certain $x \in \mathbf{Z}/p^t\mathbf{Z}$ . Finally, $y=x^a$ is a $k$ -th power if and only if $(p^{t-1}(p-1), k) \mid a$ . By definition, $p^{\gamma - 1} \mid k$ , so that we also have \begin{equation} (p^{t-1}(p-1), k) \mid a \Longleftrightarrow (p^{t-\gamma}(p-1), kp^{1-\gamma}) \mid a p^{1-\gamma}. \end{equation} Assume $n = p^\gamma$ .

Thus, $y=x^{ap^{t-\gamma}}$ is a $k$ -th power if and only if $(p^{\gamma-1}(p-1), k) \mid a p^{t}$ so that \begin{equation} (p^{\gamma-1}(p-1), k) \mid ap^{t-\gamma} \Longleftrightarrow (p-1, kp^{1-\gamma}) \mid ap^{1-\gamma}. \end{equation} Finally, for all $t \geqslant \gamma$ , I would like to say that the first relation is implied by the second, so that any $k$ -th power modulo $p^\gamma$ is also a $k$ -th power modulo $p^t$ .

87,Why Can we Write the Ray Class Group as a Quotient of Monoids,Why Can we Write the Ray Class Group as a Quotient of Monoids,,"In the book Elliptic Functions , Lang uses a definition for the ray class group of a number field that I'm not completely comfortable with. I'm trying to understand why his definition is justified. For context, I normally think of the ray class group of a number field $k$ in the following way. Let $\mathfrak f$ be a fractional ideal of $k$ . Let $F(\mathfrak f)$ be the group of fractional ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ and let $S(\mathfrak f)$ be the subgroup of principal ideals generated by elements in the ray modulo $\mathfrak f$ . Then define the ray class group modulo $\mathfrak f$ as the quotient group $F(\mathfrak f)/S(\mathfrak f)$ . Here is Lang's definition when $k$ is quadratic imaginary. This occurs in Chapter 22 at the beginning of Section 2. Again let $k$ be an imaginary quadratic field with $\mathfrak o_k = \mathfrak o$ and let $\mathfrak f$ be an [integral] ideal of $\mathfrak o, \mathfrak f \neq \mathfrak o$ . Let $G_\mathfrak f = I(\mathfrak f)/P_1(\mathfrak f)$ be the ray class group where $I(\mathfrak f)$ denotes the monoid of [integral] ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ , and $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ denotes the subset consisting of those principal ideals $(\alpha)$ such that $\alpha \equiv 1 \mod \mathfrak f$ . The key difference between this and how I think about the ray class group, is that Lang is working with integral ideals, and the set of integral ideals prime to $\mathfrak f$ forms a monoid, rather than a group. From the notation, I would guess that the set $I(\mathfrak f)/P(\mathfrak f)$ is the collection of cosets of the form $\mathfrak aP_1(\mathfrak f)$ for $\mathfrak a \in I(\mathfrak f)$ . But since $I(\mathfrak f)$ is not a group and $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ is not a subgroup, it is not even clear to me that the cosets $\mathfrak aP_1(\mathfrak f)$ actually form a partition of $I(\mathfrak f)$ in the first place. This, I think, is the heart of my issue with the definition. I think that I have shown that one can define an equivalence relation on $I(k)$ by saying $\mathfrak a \sim \mathfrak b$ if and only if there exist $(\alpha), (\beta) \in P_1(\mathfrak f)$ such that $\alpha\mathfrak a = \beta \mathfrak b$ , and in this case the set of equivalence classes do form a group which is isomorphic to $F(\mathfrak f)/S(\mathfrak f)$ , the ray class group as I normally think of it. This seems very related, but I'm not convinced on why it is the same as the definition given by Lang in terms of cosets. My Question: How is the set $I(\mathfrak f)/P_1(\mathfrak f)$ defined? Is it a collection of cosets, or something else? If it is just a collection of cosets, how exactly are the cosets defined, and how do we show that these cosets partition $I(\mathfrak f)$ ? Additional comments which may be relevant. From what I understand, if you have a monoid $M$ and a congruence $\sim$ on $M$ then the equivalence classes $M/\sim$ form a monoid. If $M$ is in fact a group then the set of congruences on $M$ are in one to one correspondence with normal subgroups of $M$ and so it makes sense to use the standard notation $M/N$ , where $N$ is some normal subgroup, for the equivalence classes. In general though if $M$ is not a group you do not have such a correspondence, and it doesn't make sense to define quotients in terms of submonoids like we do with subgroups. You must stick with using equivalence relations. However, here Lang seems to be using notation analogous to the notation that we use with groups, which really makes me think there is a natural equivalence relation that can be associated to the submonoid $P_1(\mathfrak f)$ . If this is true, it seems like the equivalence classes of this relation should just be the cosets $\mathfrak a P_1(\mathfrak f)$ .","In the book Elliptic Functions , Lang uses a definition for the ray class group of a number field that I'm not completely comfortable with.
