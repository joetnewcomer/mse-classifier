I'm worry that I'm not truly understand it, so I present it here. I hope that someone can verify it for me. The proof is a little bit long. I'm deeply grateful for your help! Suppose that $(C,<)$ and $(C',<')$ are complete linearly ordered sets without endpoints. $P\subseteq C$ and $P'\subseteq C'$ are countable and dense in $C,C'$ respectively. Then $(C,<)$ and $(C',<')$ are isomorphic. Lemma: Let $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ be countable dense linearly ordered sets without endpoints. Then $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ are isomorphic. (I presented a proof here ) For $p\in P$ , there exists $c\in C$ such that $c<p$ by the fact that $C$ has no endpoints. Since $c,p\in C$ and $c<p$ , there exists $p'\in P$ such that $c<p'<p$ by the fact that $P$ is dense in $C$ . As a result, for all $p\in P$ , there is $p'\in P$ such that $p'<p$ . Thus $P$ has no endpoints. Since $P\subseteq C$ and $C$ is linearly ordered, $P$ is linearly ordered. Similarly, $P'$ has no endpoints and is linearly ordered. As a result, $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ are countable dense linearly ordered sets without endpoints. Thus $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ are isomorphic by Lemma . We denote $\sup X$ to be the supremum calculated in $(C,<)$ for $X\subseteq C$ , and $\sup' X'$ to be the supremum calculated in $(C',<')$ for $X'\subseteq C'$ . Since $C$ and $C'$ are complete, $\sup X$ and $\sup' X'$ do exist  for all $X\subseteq C$ and $X'\subseteq C'$ . Let $f:P \to P'$ be an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ .  We define a mapping $g:C\to C'$ by $$g(x)=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}$$ Next we prove that $g$ is an an isomorphism between $(C, <)$ and $(C',<')$ such that $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in P$ . 1. $g$ is well-defined For $x\in C$ , there exists $c\in C$ such that $c<x$ by the fact that $C$ has no endpoints. Since $c,x\in C$ and $c<x$ , there exists $p\in P$ such that $c<p<x$ by the fact that $P$ is dense in $C$ . As a result, for all $x\in C$ , there is $p\in P$ such that $p<x$ . Hence $\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}\neq \emptyset$ and thus $g(x)=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}$ exists by the fact that $C'$ is complete. 2. $g$ is surjective For $c'\in C'$ , $x'=\sup' X'$ for some $X'\subseteq P'$ since $P'$ is dense in $C'$ .  Let $X=f^{-1}[X']$ , then $X\subseteq P$ and $f[X]=X'$ . Let $x=\sup X$ , then $x\in C$ . Next we prove $g(x)=x'$ . \begin{align} g(x)&=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\} \\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<\sup X\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } \exists p'\in X:p<p'\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in f[P] \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in f[X]:f(p)<'f(p')\}, f\text{ is an isomorphism}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in P' \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in X':f(p)<'f(p')\}\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } \exists c'\in X':c<'c'\}, \text{ let } c:=f(p) \text{ and }c'=f(p')\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } c<'\sup' X'\}\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } c<' x'\},\space \sup' X'=x'\\ &= x',C' \text{ is complete}\end{align} To sum up, $g(x)=x'$ and thus $g$ is surjective. 3. For all $x\in P:g(x)=f(x)$ For $x\in P$ : \begin{align}g(x)&= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in f[P] \text{ and } f(p)<'f(x)\},f \text{ is an isomorphim and } p,x\in P\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } c<'c'\},\text{let } c:=f(p) \text{ and } c':=f(x)\\ &= c',C' \text{ is complete}\\ &=f(x)\end{align} Hence $g(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in P$ . 4. For all $x,y \in C: x<y \iff g(x)<' g(y)$ It suffices to prove that for all $x,y \in C: x<y \implies g(x)<' g(y)$ . $x,y \in C$ , $x<y$ , and $P$ is dense in $C \implies$ there exist $p_1,p_2\in P$ such that $x<p_1<p_2<y$ . $p_1<p_2$ and $p_1,p_2\in P \implies f(p_1)<'f(p_2)$ by the fact that $f$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(P',<') \implies g(p_1)<'g(p_2)$ by definition of $g$ . $x<p_1 \implies \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}\subsetneq\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<p_1\} \implies \sup'\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\} \le' \sup'\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<p_1\} \implies g(x)\le' g(p_1).$ Similarly, $g(p_2)\le' g(y)$ . To sum up, we have $g(x)\le' g(p_1)<'g(p_2)\le' g(y)$ and thus $g(x)<' g(y)$ . This completes the proof. Update: Thanks to @CopyPastIt's answer! I correct my proof here. 1. We denote $\sup X$ to be the supremum calculated in $(C,<)$ for $X\subseteq C$ , and $\sup' X'$ to be the supremum calculated in $(C',<')$ for $X'\subseteq C'$ . Since $C$ and $C'$ are complete, $\sup X$ and $\sup' X'$ do exist  for all $X\subseteq C$ and $X'\subseteq C'$ . For this assertion to be correct, I must add the condition that $X,X'$ are bounded from above in $C$ and $C'$ respectively. 2. For $x\in C$ , there exists $c\in C$ such that $c<x$ by the fact that $C$ has no endpoints. Since $c,x\in C$ and $c<x$ , there exists $p\in P$ such that $c<p<x$ by the fact that $P$ is dense in $C$ . As a result, for all $x\in C$ , there is $p\in P$ such that $p<x$ . Hence $\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}\neq \emptyset$ and thus $g(x)=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}$ exists by the fact that $C'$ is complete. For $g$ to be well-defined, I must also prove that $\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}$ is bounded from above in $C'$ for all $x\in C$ . For $x\in C$ , there exists $y\in C$ such that $x<y$ by the fact that $C$ has no endpoints. Since $P$ is dense in $C$ , there exists $p'\in P$ such that $x<p'<y$ . Then $\forall p<x:p<p'$ . It follows that $\forall (p<x\text{ and }p\in P):f(p)<'f(p')$ by the fact that $f$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ . Hence $\{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\}$ is bounded from above by $f(p')$ . 3. For $c'\in C'$ , $x'=\sup' X'$ for some $X'\subseteq P'$ since $P'$ is dense in $C'$ .  Let $X=f^{-1}[X']$ , then $X\subseteq P$ and $f[X]=X'$ . Let $x=\sup X$ , then $x\in C$ . Next we prove $g(x)=x'$ . \begin{align} g(x)&=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\} \\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<\sup X\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } \exists p'\in X:p<p'\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in f[P] \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in f[X]:f(p)<'f(p')\}, f\text{ is an isomorphism}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in P' \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in X':f(p)<'f(p')\}\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } \exists c'\in X':c<'c'\}, \text{ let } c:=f(p) \text{ and }c'=f(p')\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } c<'\sup' X'\}\\ &= \sup' \{c \mid c\in P' \text{ and } c<' x'\},\space \sup' X'=x'\\ &= x',C' \text{ is complete}\end{align} To sum up, $g(x)=x'$ and thus $g$ is surjective. This assertion contains typo and is wrong. I fixed it as follows. For $x'\in C$ , let $X'=\{p'\in P' \mid p'<x'\} \subseteq P'$ . It is easy to verify that $X'$ is bounded from above in $P'$ , that $X'\neq\emptyset$ , and that $\sup' X'=x'$ . Let $X=f^{-1}[X']$ , then $X\subseteq P$ and $f[X]=X'$ . Futhermore, $X'\neq\emptyset$ , $X'$ is bounded from above in $P'$ , and $f$ is an isomorphism between $(P, <)$ and $(P',<')$ imply that $X$ is bounded from above in $P$ and that $X\neq\emptyset$ . Hence $x:=\sup X \in C$ does exists. Next we prove $g(x)=x'$ . \begin{align} g(x)&=\sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<x\} \\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } p<\sup X\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid p\in P \text{ and } \exists p'\in X:p<p'\}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in f[P] \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in f[X]:f(p)<'f(p')\}, f\text{ is an isomorphism}\\ &= \sup' \{f(p) \mid f(p)\in P' \text{ and } \exists f(p')\in X':f(p)<'f(p')\}\\ &= \sup' \{y' \mid y'\in P' \text{ and } \exists z'\in X':y'<'z'\}, \text{ let } y':=f(p) \text{ and }z':=f(p')\\ &= \sup' \{y' \mid y'\in P' \text{ and } y'<'\sup' X'\}\\ &= \sup' \{y' \mid y'\in P' \text{ and } y'<' x'\},\space \sup' X'=x'\\ &= x',C' \text{ is complete}\end{align} To sum up, $g(x)=x'$ and thus $g$ is surjective.","In my textbook, the proof of this theorem is about 5 lines and omits many important details.

82,Questions about membership relation and ordinal definition,Questions about membership relation and ordinal definition,,"This post follows the approach of Kelley General topology . I ask three questions about $\in$ relation and definition of the ordinal . I think they are related and can be asked in the same post. If you don't think so please feel free to add a comment and I'll create new posts. 1.- We say that a set (class) $X$ is transitive (complete, saturated) if every element of $X$ is also a (sometimes proper) subset of it. Namely, $$X\subseteq \{x:x\subset X\}.$$ 2.- We refer as the epsilon class to the class $$\mathcal E = \{(x,y):x\in y\}.$$ Now, an ordinal is defined as a transitive class $\alpha$ such that $\mathcal E$ is trichotomic on $\alpha$. My first question is: How can I prove that $\mathcal E$ is transitive on an ordinal $\alpha$? Because $x\in y\in z$ doesn't imply, a priori, that $x\in z$. My second question is about the epsilon class: To define ordinals, is $\mathcal E$ valid or we should consider $$ \mathcal E_\alpha =\{(x,y)\in \alpha\times \alpha : x\in y\} $$ (as Enderton does)? And finally, if our theory is allowed to work with proper classes, should we add the condition be a set in the definition of ordinal ? Because later we consider the class  $$ \mathbf {Ord}=\{\alpha:\alpha\mbox{ is an ordinal}\}, $$ but if ordinals aren't sets this class doesn't exist. Moreover, Kelley proves that $\mathbf{Ord}$ is an ordinal, but then $\mathbf{Ord}$ should be an element of itself, which violates the Axiom of Regularity.

But I think that this proof has a problem, since $t-x$ can be in $\mathbb R\setminus \mathbb Q$. As a second stage, for $c<\alpha\beta$, I should find a $t\in \mathbb Q,0\le t\le x+y$ such that $a^t>c$. Since $c<\alpha\beta$, so $\frac c\alpha<\beta$, so there is an $s\in\mathbb Q,0\le s\le y$ such that $a^s>\frac c\alpha$. Similarly there is a $r\in\mathbb Q,0\le r\le x$ such that $a^r>\frac c\beta$. Therefore $a^{r+s}>\frac{c^2}{\alpha\beta}$. So from here I think we can't obtain anything. How can I solve these problems? Thanks.",,"['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
