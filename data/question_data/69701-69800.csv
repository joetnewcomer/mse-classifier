0,Topological spaces vs. metric spaces,Topological spaces vs. metric spaces,,"Are there any ""realistic"" examples of topological spaces that are not metric spaces. You are free to invent your own definition of ""realistic"". But, at a minimum, a realistic example is one that occurs naturally as part of some other problem, not something that is fabricated to provide a counterexample or a topology homework exercise. One good example is the topological vector space of all functions $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ under pointwise convergence. Any others? If such examples are difficult to find, maybe there are results in the opposite direction: are there results that say something like ""every topology that satisfies conditions X, Y, Z can be generated from a metric""? One example: a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second-countable. Any other theorems like that?

2,Boundary of a countable union sets contained in the union of boundaries?,Boundary of a countable union sets contained in the union of boundaries?,,"First off, this is related to my previous question . Suppose that I have a countable collection of mutually disjoint open cubes $\{Q_k : k \in \mathbf{Z}^+\}$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$. What can I say about the boundary of the union?

Now, let $f:A\rightarrow A$ and $g:B\rightarrow B$ be two maps. $f$ and $g$ are said to be topologically conjugate it there exists a homeomorphism $h:A\rightarrow B$ such that, $h\circ f=g \circ h$. Mappings which are topologically conjugate are completely equivalent in terms of their dynamics. From ""An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical System"" of R. L. Devaney I know that $f: S^{1} \rightarrow S^{1}$ given by $f(\theta)=2 \theta$ is chaotic ($S^1$ denote the unit circle in the plane). Because: the angular distance between two points is doubled upon iteration of $f$. Hence $f$ is sensitive to initial condition. Topologically transitive also follows from this observation since any small arc in $S^1$ is eventually expanded by some $f^k$ to cover all of $S^1$. A point on $S^1$ is determined by any angle of the form $\theta+2k\pi$ (in radians) for an integer $k$. Now $f^n (\theta)=2^n \theta$ so that $\theta$ is periodic of period n if and only if $2^n \theta=\theta+2k\pi$, i.e. $\theta=2k\pi / (2^n - 1)$ where $1\leq k\leq 2^n$ is an integer.

Thank you very much.","Let $V$ be a set. $f: V \rightarrow V$ is said to be chaotic on $V$ if 1) $f$ has sensitive dependence on initial condition, i.e. there exists $\delta>0$ such that, for any $x\in V$ and any neighborhood $N$ of $x$, there exists $y\in N$ and $n\geq 0$ such that $|f^{n}(x)-f^{n}(y)|>\delta$. 2) $f$ is topologically transitive, i.e. for any pair of open sets $J,I\subset V$ there exists $k>0$ such that $f^{k}(J)\cap I\neq 0$. 3) periodic points are dense in $V$. Now, let $f:A\rightarrow A$ and $g:B\rightarrow B$ be two maps. $f$ and $g$ are said to be topologically conjugate it there exists a homeomorphism $h:A\rightarrow B$ such that, $h\circ f=g \circ h$. Mappings which are topologically conjugate are completely equivalent in terms of their dynamics. From ""An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical System"" of R. L. Devaney I know that $f: S^{1} \rightarrow S^{1}$ given by $f(\theta)=2 \theta$ is chaotic ($S^1$ denote the unit circle in the plane). Because: the angular distance between two points is doubled upon iteration of $f$. Hence $f$ is sensitive to initial condition. Topologically transitive also follows from this observation since any small arc in $S^1$ is eventually expanded by some $f^k$ to cover all of $S^1$. A point on $S^1$ is determined by any angle of the form $\theta+2k\pi$ (in radians) for an integer $k$. Now $f^n (\theta)=2^n \theta$ so that $\theta$ is periodic of period n if and only if $2^n \theta=\theta+2k\pi$, i.e. $\theta=2k\pi / (2^n - 1)$ where $1\leq k\leq 2^n$ is an integer. Hence the periodic points of period n for $f$ are the $(2^n - 1)$-th roots of unity. It follows that the set of periodic points are dense in $S^1$.

30,Homotopy equivalence upper triangular matrices and torus,Homotopy equivalence upper triangular matrices and torus,,"In an old algebraic topology exam, I came across this question. Let $G$ be the set of invertible upper triangular matrices in $\mathbf{C}^{2\times 2}$ , as a topological subspace of $\mathbf{C}^3\cong \mathbf{R}^6$ . (a) Prove that $G$ is homotopy equivalent to the torus. (b) Determine the push forward $\det_*:\pi_1(G,\mathbf{1})\longrightarrow \pi_1(\mathbf{C}^*,1)$ of the determinant map $\det:G\longrightarrow \mathbf{C}^*:A\longmapsto \det A$ . (a) Since $G$ consists of all matrices $\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\0 & c\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbf{C}^{2\times 2}$ with $a,c\neq 0$ , it can be identified with $\mathbf{C}^*\times\mathbf{C}\times\mathbf{C}^*$ . This can be used to prove that $G$ is path connected. Identifying the torus $T$ with $S^1\times S^1$ , we need to find continuous $f:G\to T,g:T\to G$ such that $f\circ g\simeq\text{id}_T$ and $g\circ f\simeq \text{id}_X$ . We let $$f\left( \begin{bmatrix}a&b\\0&c\end{bmatrix}\right)=(\operatorname{arg}a,\operatorname{arg}b),\quad g(\theta,\phi)=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta+i\sin\theta & 1 \\ 0 & \cos\phi+i\sin\phi \end{bmatrix}.$$ where $\operatorname{arg}$ sends a complex number to its argument in $[0,2\pi)$ . Then $f\circ g=\text{id}_T$ and $g\circ f:G\to G:\begin{bmatrix}a&b \\ 0 & c\end{bmatrix}\mapsto \begin{bmatrix} a/||a|| & b/||b|| \\ 0 & c/||c|| . \end{bmatrix}$ . Since $G$ is path connected, $g\circ f\simeq \text{id}_G$ . Is this correct? (b) I know that the fundamental group of the product space $\mathbf{C}^*\times\mathbf{C}\times\mathbf{C}^*$ is the direct product of the fundamental groups, thus $\pi_1(G,\mathbf{1})=\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$ . (I think the homotopy equivalence cannot be showed by simply noting that the fundamental group of the torus is also $\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}$ .) This has two generators $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ . We can represent (is this correct?) these on the level of the fundamental group by the loops $$\gamma_0:I\to G:t\mapsto \begin{bmatrix}e^{it} & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},\quad \gamma_1:I\to G:s\mapsto \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{is}\end{bmatrix},$$ whose images under $\det_*$ are respectievely $I\to \mathbf{C}^*:t\mapsto e^{it}$ and $I\to \mathbf{C}^*:s\mapsto e^{is}$ .

For example, from the family of closed sets of a space we can obtain its closure operator, and the fixed points of the closure operator are precisely the closed sets; the open sets are precisely the complements of the closed sets, etc. Anyway, the concepts were well-motivated from the viewpoint of continuous functions between metric spaces.

48,When are these two definitions of a continuous action equivalent?,When are these two definitions of a continuous action equivalent?,,"Apologies in advance that this is a somewhat vague question. I attempt to make precise below what would constitute an answer for me. Let $G$ be a topological group and $X$ a topological space on which $G$ acts as a set. I have in my mind two different definitions of the statement "" $G$ acts continuously on $X$ ,"" and I would like to know when they are equivalent. The real definition, per Wikipedia , is the assertion that the action map $$\alpha: G\times X \rightarrow X$$ given by $$(g,x)\mapsto gx$$ is a continuous map. This definition is very concise and conceptually slim. But the following alternative definition feels natural to me too, probably because it consists of the information I actually want to know about the action: For any $g\in G$ , the map $\rho_g:X\rightarrow X$ given by $x\mapsto gx$ is a homeomorphism, thus there is a natural group homomorphism $\rho: G\rightarrow \operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ given by $g\mapsto \rho_g$ , where $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is the group of homeomorphisms of $X$ . Endow $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ with the compact-open topology. Then $\rho:G\rightarrow \operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is a continuous map of topological spaces. I assume that these definitions are not equivalent at the generality of my setup, since if $X$ is a totally general topological space, I know that weird things can happen. For example, my impression is that $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ needn't be a topological group. (While I am unaware of a specific example, there is a theorem due to Richard Arens [Theorem 4 here ] stating that if $X$ is locally compact, locally connected hausdorff, then $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ with the compact-open topology is a topological group; so presumably this fails in greater generality. Of course, it is possible in principle that the definitions are equivalent even when $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ is not a topological group.) On the other hand, the real definition does imply the alternative definition in full generality (see appendix below), and it seems likely to me that under some ""ordinary circumstances"" they will coincide. My question is: Under what topological conditions on $G$ and $X$ do the two above definitions of a continuous group action coincide with each other? This question is admittedly vague. I would be happy with any set of conditions sufficient for equivalence that are in the language of general (i.e., point-set) topology. For example, ""this is true if $G$ and $X$ are locally connected, locally compact hausdorff [or whatever]"" would be a satisfying answer, whereas, ""this is true if $G$ is a Lie group and $X$ is a manifold"" is narrower than what I am looking for. Appendix: proof that the standard definition implies the alternative one: Suppose that the action map $\alpha:G\times X\rightarrow X$ is continuous. A ""cross-section embedding"" $X\hookrightarrow G\times X$ given, for a fixed $g$ , by $x\mapsto (g,x)$ , is a continuous map. (An open set in $G\times X$ is a union of sets $V\times U$ , with $V\subset G$ and $U\subset X$ open, and the pullback in $X$ under this ""cross-section embedding"" will be the union of just those $U$ 's whose corresponding $V$ contains $g$ . This is a union of open sets, therefore open.) Therefore, fixing $g$ , the composite map $$ X\hookrightarrow G\times X \xrightarrow{\alpha} X $$ given by $$ x\mapsto (g,x) \mapsto gx$$ is continuous. This is the map $\rho_g$ . It is inverse to $\rho_{g^{-1}}$ , which is continuous for the same reason. Thus $\rho_g$ is a homeomorphism for every $g$ , in full generality. Let $K,U\subset X$ be compact and open, respectively, and let $[K,U]\subset \operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ be the set of homeomorphisms $f:X\rightarrow X$ satisfying $f(K)\subset U$ . Then $\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ consists of those $g\in G$ such that $\rho_g(K)\subset U$ . I would like to know that $\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ is open, since the $[K,U]$ 's form a subbase for the topology of $\operatorname{Homeo}(X)$ . Fix an arbitrary $g\in \rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Let $k\in K$ be arbitrary. Then $gk = \rho_g(k)=\alpha(g,k)\in U$ , i.e., $(g,k)\in\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Since $\alpha$ is continuous and $U$ is open, $\alpha^{-1}(U)\subset G\times X$ is open, thus $(g,k)$ is contained in a basis open set of the product topology on $G\times X$ that is entirely contained in $\alpha^{-1}(U)$ . Let it be $V_{gk}\times U_{gk}$ , where $V_{gk}\subset G$ and $U_{gk}\subset X$ are open, and $g\in V_{gk}$ while $k\in U_{gk}$ . Keeping $g$ fixed while allowing $k$ to vary across $K$ , we get an open cover $\{U_{gk}\}|_{k\in K}$ of $K$ . Since $K$ is compact, this cover has a finite subcover $U_{gk_1},\dots,U_{gk_s}$ . Let $V=\bigcap_1^s V_{gk_j}$ . Because this intersection is finite, $V$ is an open subset of $G$ . Since $V\times U_{gk_j} \subset V_{gk_j}\times U_{gk_j}\subset \alpha^{-1}(U)$ for each $j=1,\dots,s$ , we have $$ V\times K \subset V\times \bigcup_1^s U_{gk_j} = \bigcup_1^s V\times U_{gk_j} \subset \alpha^{-1}(U).$$ The first containment is because by construction, $U_{gk_1},\dots,U_{gk_s}$ is a cover of $K$ . Translating the containment $V\times K\subset \alpha^{-1}(U)$ in terms of $\rho$ , this says that $V\subset\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Now clearly $g\in V$ since $g\in V_{gk_j}$ for each $j$ (in fact, $g\in V_{gk}$ for each $k$ ). Thus we have identified an open set of $G$ containing $g$ and contained in $\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ . Since $g$ was arbitrary, it follows that $\rho^{-1}([K,U])$ is open. Therefore, $\rho$ is continuous. This proof that $\rho$ is continuous is a direct adaptation of this proof given by Olivier Begassat in the special case that $X=G$ and the action is regular.","Apologies in advance that this is a somewhat vague question.

I wish I could dedicate more time to solve the problem and review the basic properties of topological groups, but unfortunely I am overhelmed with my own stuff.",,"['general-topology', 'group-theory', 'topological-groups']"

In a normed space we can use (absolutely convergent)$\implies$(convergent) for series, but this won't work in a metric space. I've tried using an explicit homeomorphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ and taking pullbacks and pushforwards along $f$ of a Cauchy sequence in $X$, but without success. Many thanks for any help with this!",,"['general-topology', 'functional-analysis', 'metric-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'complete-spaces']"

In Chapter IV Paragraph 2.2, Johnstone constructs the Stone-Čech compactification of a locale $A$ as the locale $C(A)$ of completely regular ideals in $A$, and in Paragraph 2.3 he shows that the points of $C(A)$ may be identified with the maximal completely regular filters in $A$. There are two points here where I was unable to follow the reasoning. Unfortunately, they're a bit technical. Let's start with the definitions. Fix a locale $A$. We say that $a$ is well inside $b$, written $a \eqslantless b$, if there exists $c$ such that $a\land c = 0_A$ and $b\lor c = 1_A$. Equivalently, we could just require that $b \lor \lnot a = 1_A$. We say that $a$ is really inside $b$, written $a \,\unicode{x02A9B}\, b$ if there is a scale between $a$ and $b$, i.e. if there exist $\{c_q\mid q\in \mathbb{Q}\cap [0,1]\}$ such that $a\leq c_0$, $c_1\leq b$, and $c_p \eqslantless c_q$ for all $p<q$. We say that $A$ is completely regular if $a = \bigvee_A\{b\mid b\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,a\}$ for all $a$. We say that an ideal $I\subseteq A$ is completely regular if for all $a\in I$ there exists $b\in I$ with $a\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,b$. We say that a filter $F\subseteq A$ is completely regular if for all $a\in F$ there exists $b\in F$ with $b\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,a$. $C(A)$ is the locale of completely regular ideals of $A$. $C(A)$ is a subframe of $\mathrm{Idl}(A)$, so the meet of finitely many completely regular ideals is their intersection and join of some completely regular ideals is the ideal generated by the union. Further, $C(A)$ is compact and completely regular. Question 1: Lemma 2.3 states that the poset of completely regular filters of $A$ is isomorphic to the poset of completely regular filters of $C(A)$. In the last step, Johnstone writes, ""A similar argument shows $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G) = G$ for any completely regular filter $G$ of $C(A)$."" It doesn't matter what the functions $\overline{f}_*$, $\overline{f}^*$, $f_*$, and $f^*$ are: What matters is that for $J\in C(A)$, $f_*f^*(J) = \{a\in A\mid a \,\unicode{x02A9B}\, \bigvee_A J\}$, and $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G)$ is the filter of $C(A)$ generated by $f_*f^*(J)$ for all $J\in G$. Since $J$ is completely regular, $J\subseteq f_*f^*(J)$ for all $J$, so $f_*f^*(J) \in G$, and it is clear that $\overline{f}_*\overline{f}^*(G) \subseteq G$. To prove the converse, we would like to take any completely regular ideal $I\in G$ and find some $J\in G$ such that $f_*f^*(J) \subseteq I$. Since $G$ is completely regular, there is some $J\in G$ with $J\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,I$, so it would be reasonable to try to prove that $J\,\unicode{x02A9B}\,I$ implies $f_*f^*(J)\subseteq I$.

For those who are not familiar with this, here is a brief statement of what this says: Definition: A boolean algebra is a partially ordered set $A$ such that 1) $A$ has finite meets and finite joins, including the empty join. 2) Meets distribute over joins in $A$ 3) For each $a \in A$ , there is $b$ such that $a \vee b$ is the greatest element, and $a \wedge b$ is the least element. (1) says that $A$ is a bounded lattice, (1) and (2) say that $A$ is a bounded distributive lattice, and (3) says that $A$ is complemented. Definition: A stone space $X$ is a space occuring as the cofiltered limit $\text{limit}\ X_i$ of discrete spaces in the category of topological spaces. One functor $\text{Spec} : \text{Bool} \rightarrow \text{Stone}$ sends a boolean algebra $A$ to $\text{Bool}(A, \{ 0, 1 \})$ of maps of boolean algebras from $A$ to the boolean algebra $\{ 0, 1\}$ .
