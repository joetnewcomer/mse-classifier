To determine the middle pumpkin, I multiplied by 5 to find the total weight of the five pumpkins (288.75) and then subtracted the lightest and heaviest weight ('C' = 58.75).

In addition, I concluded the values must end in .5 to increase the combinations. The question is: is there a correct answer and what is it, or is this unsolvable? Thanks.","Every year, there is a contest to see who has the heaviest pumpkins for that year. Last year, a farmer brought 5 pumpkins to the contest. Instead of weighing them one at a time, he informed the judges, ""When I weighed two at a time, I got the following weights: 108, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, and 122."" How much did each pumpkin weigh? I tried solving this problem by summing all the weights (1,155) and dividing by 10 to get the average weight of two pumpkins (115.5). I then divided by 2 to get the average weight of each pumpkin (57.75). To determine the middle pumpkin, I multiplied by 5 to find the total weight of the five pumpkins (288.75) and then subtracted the lightest and heaviest weight ('C' = 58.75). Fast forward, I determined 'A' = 53.25, 'B' = 54.75, 'C' = 58.75, 'D' = 60.75, and 'E' = 61.25. However upon review, I determined that these values could not produce the 10 weights. In addition, I concluded the values must end in .5 to increase the combinations. The question is: is there a correct answer and what is it, or is this unsolvable? Thanks.",,['algebra-precalculus']

(Here $n \in \mathbb N$ is a given number such that $x!=n$ has a solution in $x \in \mathbb N$ .) The problem is easy with a calculator and for small $n$ .

To solve the equation, I could think of two methods. Here is their description: Method 1 - prime factorization: In this method, we find the prime factorization of $n$ . To do this, we keep dividing $n$ by $2$ until we get an odd number. This is equivalent to finding $\log_2 n$ . But since $n$ is a large number, it is very difficult and long process. For the example problem, we have to divide $n$ by $2$ , $35$ times. Yet this doesn't give the exact answer. Since $\lfloor 38/2 \rfloor + \lfloor 38/2^2 \rfloor + \dots =\lfloor 39/2 \rfloor + \lfloor 39/2^2 \rfloor + \dots=35$ this implies that $x=38$ or $x=39$ . We have to divide the $n$ by $13^3$ to be sure that $x=38$ is the solution. Method 2 - Stirling's approximation: In this method, we use the Stirling's approximation formula, which is $x! \sim \sqrt {2\pi x}(\frac x e)^x$ . But it is not easy to find $x$ in terms of $n$ . Here is my workings to do that: $$x!=n$$ $$\implies \sqrt {2\pi x}(\frac x e)^x=n$$ $$\implies 2\pi x (\frac x e)^{2x}=n^2$$ $$\implies x^ {2x+1}\cdot \frac 1 {e^{2x}}=\frac {n^2}{2\pi}$$ I am unable to proceed after that.

Let me give you an example: $\sqrt{2} = [1; \overline{2}]$, $\sqrt{7} = [2; \overline{1, 1, 1, 4}]$ and $\sqrt{14} = [3; \overline{1, 2, 1, 6}]$. Now clearly $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{7} = \sqrt{14}$, but if we do continued fractions arithmetic we get: $[1; \overline{2}] \times [2; \overline{1, 1, 1, 4}] = 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, 1, 2, 1, 6, \dots$. Obviously this sequence never ends, since the continued fraction can always input a term from either $\sqrt{2}$ or $\sqrt{7}$ (as they are infinite). So my question is: is there a mathematical method to detect when the period ends (during addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), rather than guessing and checking? Maybe using the $z$ object ( this ""thing"" )? For example, after it emits the first $1$ it is: $\left \langle \begin{matrix}13 & 31 & 28 & 67\\   11 & 27 2& 8 & 20 \end{matrix}\right \rangle$ and when the period starts again: $\left \langle \begin{matrix} 549 & 1317 & 2226 & 5335\\ 95 & 239 & 814 & 2010 \end{matrix} \right \rangle$ and again: $\left \langle \begin{matrix} 92029 & 222405 & 122610 &  296283\\ 41317 & 99487 & 37841 & 91039 \end{matrix} \right \rangle$. Is there some kind of a pattern? I've noted none. Thank you, rubik",,"['algebra-precalculus', 'continued-fractions']"
