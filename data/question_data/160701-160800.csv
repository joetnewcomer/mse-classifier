2,What is the Bernoulli product measure's Radon-Nikodym derivative wrt Lebesgue measure?,What is the Bernoulli product measure's Radon-Nikodym derivative wrt Lebesgue measure?,,"The Bernoulli product measure $\mu$ can be defined for each $p\in (0,1)$ on $\Omega = \{0,1\}^\mathbb N=\{\omega=(\omega_i)|\omega_i\in\{0,1\}, i\in\mathbb N\}=\Pi_{i=1}^\infty \{0,1\}$ .  The measure $\mu$ is essentially defined by a collection of Bernoulli random variables $X_i:\Omega\to\{0,1\}$ which take the value $1$ with probability $p$ and $0$ with probability $1-p$ depending only on the $i$ th coordinate of $\omega\in\Omega$ .  The pre-images $X_i^{-1}(0)$ and $X_i^{-1}(1)$ are examples of cylinder sets in the product space and generate the $\sigma$ -algebra that the product measure $\mu$ is defined on. We can then define a map $\Omega\to [0;1]\subset\mathbb R$ by $\omega=(\omega_i)\mapsto \sum_{i=1}^\infty \omega_i 2^{-i}$ .  Up to a set of Lebesgue measure $0$ having to do with duplicate  binary expansions of the dyadic rationals $k/2^n$ ( $k,n\in\mathbb N$ ), this map identifies $\Omega$ with the unit interval $[0,1]\subset\mathbb R$ .  The duplicate issue is that dyadic rationals have both an infinite and a terminating binary expansion (in binary, $1/2=0.1=0.0\bar 1$ ), so the map is not a perfect bijection on that countable set. We now have two measures on $[0;1]$ , $\mu$ and Lebesgue measure $\cal L$ .  They are defined on slightly different $\sigma$ -algebras since $\cal L$ is defined on the Borel sets and $\mu$ is defined on the $\sigma$ -algebra generated by the sets that make the random variables $X_i$ measurable (generated by the cylinder sets). Is there anything like a Radon-Nikodym derivative of $\mu$ with respect to $\cal L$ even though they are not defined on the same $\sigma$ -algebras?  For example, is it possible to extend or intersect the $\sigma$ -algebras to obtain a useful integral formula with an actual density function so that we could write $$\mu=\nu + \int f d\cal L$$ on some meaningful collection of sets? ( $\nu$ a measure singular wrt $\cal L$ ) I've looked in a number of books including Billingsley, Chung, Folland, Rudin, Durrett, Cohn, and others.  They discuss the construction of $\mu$ , the differences of the $\sigma$ -algebras that $\mu$ and $\cal L$ are defined on, but I haven't been able to find any kind of expression of one with respect to the other, if that's possible in some way.

Also, for the compact definition, I can only think of using every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover for the topological definition of compact sets. I don't know where I went wrong, but I don't see where I used the fact of $K$ being compact. So I'll put what I did. Suppose that $\inf f(K)$ exists, then let's call it $a \in \mathbb{R}$.

27,A detailed and self-contained proof of Tonelli's theorem,A detailed and self-contained proof of Tonelli's theorem,,"Motivation: I have seen the interchange of limit/derivative and integral many times, but don't know how such operation makes sense. I've always desired to remove this uncertainty by giving a detailed proof in which any argument is justified. In doing so, I've searched on the Internet and found that most proofs are either too long and need so many between lemmas (in this case, I feel that the main ideas are hidden), or omit important details (at least details not obvious for me). Then I come across these $2$ lectures ( here and here ). I basically copy the whole argument in the former for the measurability part. For the part of repeated integral, I'm proud that I do not copy but adapt the idea in the latter lecture (which is for complete measure) to my case (which is $\sigma$ -finite measure). It takes me $3$ days to complete the proof. I'm very happy because I now understand the machinery that makes the theorem right. This effort also solidifies my understanding of monotone and dominated convergence theorems. My question: My proof is very clear and detailed, so it's easy to follow. I hope somebody will take time help me verify it and point out anything unclear or incorrect. Thank you so much for your help! Related definitions of Bochner integrals can be found here . Let $(X, \mathcal A, \mu)$ and $(Y, \mathcal B, \nu)$ be $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces. $\Sigma := \mathcal A \times \mathcal B$ . $\mathcal C := \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal B$ the product $\sigma$ -algebra of $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ . $\lambda := \mu \otimes \nu$ the product measure of $\mu$ and $\nu$ . $\mathcal S (X \times Y, \lambda, {\mathbb R}^+)$ the space of $\lambda$ -simple functions from $X \times Y$ to ${\mathbb R}^+$ . $\mathcal  L_0 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ the space of $\nu$ -measurable functions $X \times Y$ to $\overline{\mathbb R}{}^+$ . $\mathcal  L_1 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ the space of $\nu$ -integrable functions $X \times Y$ to $\overline{\mathbb R}{}^+$ . Tonelli's theorem: Let $f: X \times Y \to \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+$ measurable. $f_x: Y \to \mathbb R, \, y \mapsto f(x, y)$ for all $x \in X$ . $f_y: X \to \mathbb R, \, x \mapsto f(x, y)$ for all $y \in Y$ . Then (i) The maps $$\phi: X \ni x \mapsto \int_Y f_x  \, \mathrm d \nu  \quad \text{and} \quad \psi: Y \ni y \mapsto \int_X f_y  \, \mathrm d \mu $$ are measurable. (ii) $$\int_X \phi  \, \mathrm d \mu = \int_{X \times Y} f \, \mathrm d \lambda = \int_Y \psi \, \mathrm d \nu.$$ Proof: Lemma: Let $x \in X$ and $G \in \mathcal C$ . The $x$ -section $G_x$ defined by $G_x := \{y \in Y \mid (x,y) \in G\}$ is measurable. Proof: Let $\mathcal D_x := \{G \in \mathcal C \mid G_x \text{ is measurable}\}$ . Notice that $(G^c)_x =(G_x)^c$ and $(\bigcap_n G_n)_x = \bigcap_n (G_n)_x$ . So $\mathcal D_x$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra over $X \times Y$ . For $A \times B \in \Sigma$ , $(A \times B)_x = B$ if $x \in A$ and $\emptyset$ otherwise. So $\Sigma \subseteq \mathcal D_x$ and thus $\mathcal D_x = \mathcal C$ . We fix a non-decreasing sequence $(Y_n)$ of sets in $\mathcal B$ such that $\bigcup Y_n = Y$ and $\nu(Y_n) < \infty$ . By symmetry, it's sufficient to prove for $\phi$ . We proceed to prove (i) for $f =1_G$ with $G \in \mathcal C$ . We write $\phi_G$ instead of $\phi$ . Then $\phi_G(x) = \int_Y 1_{G} (x,y) \mathrm d \nu(y) = \int_Y 1_{G_x} \mathrm d \nu = \nu(G_x)$ , which is well-defined by our Lemma .  Let $\mathcal D := \{G \in \mathcal C \mid \phi_G \text{ is measurable}\}$ . First, we assume $\nu$ is finite. If $G \in \mathcal D$ , then $\phi_{G^\mathrm c}  = \nu(Y) -\phi_G$ is measurable because $\nu(Y)<\infty$ and $\phi_G$ is measurable. If $(G_n)$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint (p.w.d.) sets in $\mathcal D$ , then $\phi_{\bigcup G_n}  = \sum_n \phi_{G_n}$ is measurable. As a result, $\mathcal D$ is indeed a $\sigma$ -algebra. If $G= A\times B \in \Sigma$ , then $\phi_G = \nu(B) 1_A$ which is simple and thus measurable. Hence $\Sigma \subseteq \mathcal D$ and thus $\mathcal D = \mathcal C$ . Second, we assume $\nu$ is $\sigma$ -finite. We define a sequence $(\nu_n)$ of finite measures on $Y$ by $\nu_n(B) := \nu(B \cap Y_n)$ for $B \in \mathcal B$ . Let $\phi_{G,n}(x) := \nu_n(G_x)$ and $\mathcal D_n := \{G \in \mathcal C \mid \phi_{G, n} \text{ is measurable}\}$ . As in the case $\nu$ is finite, we can prove that $\mathcal D_n = \mathcal C$ . We have $G_x \cap Y_n \nearrow G_x \cap Y = G_x$ , so $\nu_n (G_x) =\nu(G_x \cap Y_n) \nearrow \nu(G_x)$ by continuity from below of measure. This means $\phi_{G,n} \nearrow \phi_G$ and thus $\phi_{G}$ is measurable for $G \in \mathcal C$ . Hence $\mathcal D = \mathcal C$ . By linearity of integrals, (i) also holds for $\mathcal S (X \times Y, \lambda, \mathbb R^+)$ . If $f \in \mathcal L_0 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ , then there is a non-decreasing sequence of $(f_n)$ in $\mathcal S (X \times Y, \lambda, \mathbb R^+)$ such that $f_n \to f$ . It follows that (i) also holds for $f \in \mathcal L_0 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ . We proceed to prove (ii) for $f =1_G$ with $G=A \times B \in \Sigma$ . As shown above, $\phi_G = \nu(B) 1_A$ , so $\int_X \phi_{G} \, \mathrm d \mu = \mu(A)\nu(B)$ . On the other hand, $\int_{X \times Y} 1_{G} \, \mathrm d \lambda = \lambda(A\times B) = \mu(A) \nu(B)$ by construction of product measure $\lambda$ . Hence (ii) holds for this kind of $f$ . We proceed to prove (ii) for $f =1_G$ with $G = \bigcup_k A_k \times B_k$ with $A_k \times B_k \in \Sigma$ . By this result, we can assume that $(A_k \times B_k)$ are p.w.d., which implies $\phi_{G}  = \sum_{k} \phi_{A_k \times B_k}$ and $1_{G}  = \sum_{k} 1_{A_k \times B_k}$ . Clearly, $\sum_{k=1}^n \phi_{A_k \times B_k} \nearrow \phi_G$ and $\sum_{k=1}^n 1_{A_k \times B_k} \nearrow 1_{G}$ as $n \to \infty$ .  As such, \begin{align} \int_X \phi_{G} \mathrm d \mu &= \int_X \lim_n \sum_{k=1}^n \phi_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \mu &&\overset{(1)}{=} \lim_n \int_X \sum_{k=1}^n \phi_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \mu \\ &\overset{(2)}{=} \lim_n \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{X} \phi_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \mu &&\overset{}{=} \lim_n \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{X \times Y}  1_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \lambda \\ &\overset{(3)}{=} \lim_n \int_{X \times Y} \sum_{k=1}^n 1_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \lambda &&\overset{(4)}{=} \int_{X \times Y} \lim_n \sum_{k=1}^n 1_{A_k \times B_k} \mathrm d \lambda\\ &= \int_{X \times Y} 1_G \mathrm d \lambda. \end{align} Here we apply monotone convergence theorem (m.c.t) to obtain $(1)$ and $(4)$ . The interchange of finite sum and integral in $(2)$ and $(3)$ is valid [even if all individual integrals are $\infty$ ] because all individual functions are non-negative. Hence (ii) also holds for this type of $G$ . We proceed to prove (ii) for $f =1_G$ with $G \in \mathcal C$ and $\lambda (G) < \infty$ . By construction of product outer measure and the fact that $\lambda(G) < \infty$ , there exists a sequence $(G_n)$ such that $G_n = \bigcup_m A^{(n)}_m \times B^{(n)}_m \supseteq G$ , $A^{(n)}_m \times B^{(n)}_m \in \Sigma$ , and $\lambda (G_n) \searrow \lambda(G)$ . Without loss of generality, we assume $\lambda(G_1) < \infty$ . Let $E_k := \bigcap_{n=1}^k G_n$ and $E := \bigcap_k E_k$ . Then $G \subseteq E$ , $\lambda(G) = \lambda(E)$ , $E_1 = G_1$ , and $E_k \searrow E$ . By results (a) and (b) , $E_k$ can be written as countable union of p.w.d. sets in $\Sigma$ . As shown above, $\int_X \phi_{E_k} \mathrm d \mu = \int_{X \times Y} 1_{E_k} \mathrm d \lambda$ for all $k$ . Notice that $E_x = (\bigcap_{k} E_k)_x = \bigcap_{k} (E_k)_x$ implies $(E_k)_x \searrow E_x$ . By continuity from above of measure, $\phi_{E_k} = \nu((E_k)_x) \searrow \nu(E_x) =\phi_{E}$ and $1_{E_k} \searrow 1_E$ . We get \begin{align} \int_X \phi_{E} \mathrm d \mu &= \int_X \lim_k \phi_{E_k} \mathrm d \mu &&\overset{(5)}{=} \lim_k \int_X \phi_{E_k} \mathrm d \mu \\ &= \lim_k \int_{X \times Y} 1_{E_k} \mathrm d \lambda &&\overset{(6)}{=}  \int_{X \times Y} \lim_k 1_{E_k} \mathrm d \lambda \\ &= \int_{X \times Y} 1_{E} \mathrm d \lambda &&= \lambda(E). \end{align} It follows from $E_k \subseteq E_1$ that $0 \le \phi_{E_k} \le \phi_{E_1}$ and $0 \le 1_{E_k} \le 1_{E_1}$ for all $k$ . Also, $\int_X \phi_{E_1} \mathrm d \mu = \int_{X \times Y} 1_{E_1} \mathrm d \lambda = \lambda(E_1)= \lambda(G_1) < \infty$ . Here we apply dominated convergence theorem (d.c.t.) to obtain $(5)$ and $(6)$ . Let $F := E \setminus G$ . We have $\lambda(E) = \lambda (G) + \lambda(F)$ and $\lambda(E) = \lambda(G) < \infty$ , so $\lambda (F) =0$ . With the same reasoning, there is a sequence $H_1 \supseteq H_{2} \supseteq \cdots \supseteq H_k \supseteq \cdots$ such that $H_k$ is a countable union of p.w.d sets in $\Sigma$ and that $H := \bigcap_k H_k \supseteq F$ , $\lambda(F) = \lambda (H)=0$ , $\phi_{H_k} \searrow \phi_H$ , and $1_{H_k} \searrow 1_H$ . By twice applications of d.c.t again, we get $\int_X \phi_{H} \mathrm d \mu = \int_{X \times Y} 1_{H} \mathrm d \lambda = \lambda(H) = 0$ . This means $\nu(H_x) =\phi_H (x) = 0$ for $\mu$ -a.e $x \in X$ . On the other hand, $F_x \subseteq H_x$ is measurable by our Lemma, so $\phi_F (x) =\nu (F_x)=0$ for $\mu$ -a.e $x \in X$ . Hence $\int_X \phi_{F} \mathrm d \mu =0$ . It follows from $G \cup F = E$ and $G \cap F =\emptyset$ that $\phi_G +\phi_F = \phi_E$ and thus $\int_X ( \phi_{G} + \phi_F) \mathrm d \mu  = \int_X \phi_{E} \mathrm d \mu$ . Notice that $\phi_G, \phi_F \ge0$ , so $\int_X \phi_{G} \mathrm d \mu + \int_X \phi_{F} \mathrm d \mu = \int_X \phi_{E} \mathrm d \mu$ [even if both individual integrals are $\infty$ ] and thus $\int_X \phi_{G} \mathrm d \mu = \int_X \phi_{E} \mathrm d \mu$ . It follows from $\int_X \phi_{E} \mathrm d \mu = \lambda (G)$ that (ii) holds for $G \in \mathcal C$ with $\lambda (G) < \infty$ . By linearity of integrals, (ii) also holds for $\mathcal S (X \times Y, \lambda, \mathbb R^+)$ . If $f \in \mathcal L_0 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ , then there is a non-decreasing sequence of $(f_n)$ in $\mathcal S (X \times Y, \lambda, \mathbb R^+)$ such that $f_n \to f$ . By m.c.t., (ii) also holds for $f \in \mathcal L_0 (X \times Y, \lambda, \overline{\mathbb R}{}^+)$ .","Motivation: I have seen the interchange of limit/derivative and integral many times, but don't know how such operation makes sense. I've always desired to remove this uncertainty by giving a detailed proof in which any argument is justified. In doing so, I've searched on the Internet and found that most proofs are either too long and need so many between lemmas (in this case, I feel that the main ideas are hidden), or omit important details (at least details not obvious for me). Then I come across these lectures ( here and here ). I basically copy the whole argument in the former for the measurability part. For the part of repeated integral, I'm proud that I do not copy but adapt the idea in the latter lecture (which is for complete measure) to my case (which is -finite measure). It takes me days to complete the proof. I'm very happy because I now understand the machinery that makes the theorem right. This effort also solidifies my understanding of monotone and dominated convergence theorems. My question: My proof is very clear and detailed, so it's easy to follow. I hope somebody will take time help me verify it and point out anything unclear or incorrect. Thank you so much for your help! Related definitions of Bochner integrals can be found here .

Let $\mu$ be a measure on $(X, \mathcal A)$ , and let $f, f_1,f_2, \ldots$ and $g,g_1,g_2,\ldots$ be real-valued $\mathcal A$ -measureable functions on $X$ . (a) Show that if $\mu$ is finite, if $f_n \to f$ in measure, and $g_n \to g$ in measure, then $f_n g_n \to fg$ in measure. With some effort, I was able to work out a direct proof, similar to the one outlined in this answer . After re-reading the section, I came up with an alternative argument similar to the one used by Cohn to prove another theorem. It results in a much quicker proof, and almost seems like a magic trick. I want to make sure that my argument is correct. I use the following results, proved by Cohn in this section, for real-valued measurable functions: Proposition 3.1.3: If $f_n \to f$ in measure, then there is a subsequence such that $f_{n_k} \to f$ almost everywhere. Proposition 3.1.2: If $\mu$ is finite and $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere, then $f_n \to f$ in measure. Here is my proof: Let $\{n_k\}$ be any subsequence of $\mathbb N$ . Then $f_{n_k} \to f$ and $g_{n_k} \to g$ in measure, so by Proposition 3.1.3 there is a subsequence $\{n_{k_j}\}\subset \{n_k\}$ such that $f_{n_{k_j}} \to f$ and $g_{n_{k_j}} \to g$ almost everywhere. (To see this, take a subsequence of $\{n_k\}$ that works for $f$ . Then that subsequence has a subsequence which works for both $f$ and $g$ .) Therefore $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ almost everywhere. As $\mu$ is finite, Proposition 3.1.2 implies that $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ in measure. Now here is the magic part: Suppose that $f_n g_n$ does not converge to $fg$ in measure. Then there is some $\epsilon > 0$ such that $\mu\{|f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon\}$ does not converge to zero. Thus there is some $\delta > 0$ such that $\mu\{|f_n g_n - fg| > \epsilon\} > \delta$ for infinitely many $n$ . In other words, there is a subsequence $\{n_k\} \subset \mathbb N$ such that $\mu\{|f_{n_k} g_{n_k} - fg| > \epsilon\} > \delta$ for all $n_k$ . Clearly this subsequence cannot have any further subsequence $\{n_{k_j}\}$ for which $f_{n_{k_j}} g_{n_{k_j}} \to fg$ in measure, but this contradicts what we showed above. Consequently, $f_n g_n$ must converge to $fg$ in measure. Is this argument legitimate? It almost seems too easy.","This is Problem 3.1.5 in Cohn's Measure Theory , 2nd edition.

Let $\mu$ and $\nu$ be $T$ -invariant finite measures such that $\nu \ll \mu$ . Let $f\in L^1(X,\mu)$ be the Radon-Nikodym derivative $d\nu/d\mu$ . I have two questions: (1) Is $f$ a $T$ -invariant element of $L^1(X,\mu)$ , in the sense that $\int_Efd\mu = \int_E f\circ T d\mu$ for all $E\in\mathcal{B}$ ? (2) If the answer is yes, is it possible to prove this without recourse to the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem or an equivalent? If the answer is no, what is an example? Motivation, thoughts, and the soft question: I am asking because on the one hand, it seems to me on general grounds that the fact that $f$ is defined uniquely in terms of the $T$ -invariant measures $\nu$ and $\mu$ ought to force it to be $T$ -invariant. (Where could the ability to change with $T$ come from, if not from $\mu$ or $\nu$ ?) On the other hand, when I apply the definitions directly, so far I have only been able to demonstrate the equality $$ \int_E fd\mu = \int_E f\circ Td\mu$$ for sets $E$ in the pullback $\sigma$ -algebra $T^{-1}\mathcal{B}$ . For example, we have $$\int_{T^{-1}E}fd\mu = \nu(T^{-1}E) = \nu(E)=\int_E fd\mu = \int_EfdT_*\mu = \int_{T^{-1}E} f\circ Td\mu$$ verifying the equality for sets of the form $T^{-1}E$ . Maybe I'm just not being clever enough, but every time I've played with it so far, this is how it comes out. Thus if $T$ is invertible, I have the desired equality, but if not, then I am not sure. Meanwhile, if we make the additional assumption that $\mu,\nu$ are probability measures and that $\mu$ is ergodic, then using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem I can prove that $\nu = \mu$ , which of course implies that $f=1$ . After some more work this implies that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular. My soft question , which is really what the title is about, is, does this result in some essential way ""come from"" the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem? If the answer above to (1) is yes, and it is possible to prove it without the BET, then this could in turn be used to prove that if $\mu,\nu$ are probability measures with $\mu$ ergodic, then $\nu=\mu$ , and then this would imply that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular without needing the BET. But my experience playing around so far makes it seem as though somehow without the BET, the definitions themselves are ""not enough power."" Is there anything to this? If so, what do I really mean? What aspect of the situation that the BET illuminates is needed for this result? Thanks in advance for your thoughts.","This is really motivated by the soft question at the end, but let me begin with something more circumscribed: Let be a measurable space and let be a self-map measurable with respect to .

(2) If the answer is yes, is it possible to prove this without recourse to the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem or an equivalent? If the answer is no, what is an example? Motivation, thoughts, and the soft question: I am asking because on the one hand, it seems to me on general grounds that the fact that is defined uniquely in terms of the -invariant measures and ought to force it to be -invariant. (Where could the ability to change with come from, if not from or ?) On the other hand, when I apply the definitions directly, so far I have only been able to demonstrate the equality for sets in the pullback -algebra . For example, we have verifying the equality for sets of the form . Maybe I'm just not being clever enough, but every time I've played with it so far, this is how it comes out. Thus if is invertible, I have the desired equality, but if not, then I am not sure. Meanwhile, if we make the additional assumption that are probability measures and that is ergodic, then using the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem I can prove that , which of course implies that . After some more work this implies that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular. My soft question , which is really what the title is about, is, does this result in some essential way ""come from"" the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem? If the answer above to (1) is yes, and it is possible to prove it without the BET, then this could in turn be used to prove that if are probability measures with ergodic, then , and then this would imply that distinct ergodic measures are mutually singular without needing the BET. But my experience playing around so far makes it seem as though somehow without the BET, the definitions themselves are ""not enough power."" Is there anything to this? If so, what do I really mean? What aspect of the situation that the BET illuminates is needed for this result?

I'm in troubles with constructing the function: I thought about considering the function as an infinite sum of sucession of increasing and conitnuous function, I considered the Cantor-Vitali functions which is defined on $[0,1]$ and is continuous and incresing (not strictly). So $f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{-k}\phi(3^{-k}x)$ where $2^{-k}$ is there to makes the sum converging and $\phi$ is the Cantor-Vitali function. The sum convergethe function in continuous (as sum of) and is defined as asked.But I'm in trouble while proving that is strictly increasing.Honestly it seems to be but I don't know how to prove it.

92,Ash's construction of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure from a distribution function,Ash's construction of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes Measure from a distribution function,,"I'm reading this book Probability & Measure Theory by Ash. I think I've come across a part that is a little hand-wavy. We are trying to build a Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure from a distribution function $F$ ( in that the measure of interval $(a,b]$ is $F(b) - F(a)$ ). He starts by adding $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ to the real line so that we can work in compact space. He defines right-semiclosed as intervals of the form $(a, b]$ and $[-\infty, b]$ and $(-\infty, b]$ . He then constructs a field  by taking all finite unions of these right-semiclosed intervals. He defines a set function over this field defined in the intuitive way (the set function takes $(a,b]$ to $F(b) - F(a)$ ) , and he shows that this set function is countably additive. This is where I don't understand his argument. He seems to say, ignore these points $+\infty$ and $-\infty$ so that our field no longer uses the compact space, and our set function now becomes a proper measure over a real field. Then apply the Carathéodory Extension Theorem. I don't see how we can go from a compact space to a non-compact space without causing harm to the properties of our set function. I'm hoping that this construction method is widely used, and someone can explain where I am confused. This is Theorem 1.4.4 in Ash, 2nd Edition.
