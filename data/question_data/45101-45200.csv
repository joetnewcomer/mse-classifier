97,What are classifying spaces of algebraic categories like?,What are classifying spaces of algebraic categories like?,,"Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category. Recall that the nerve $N(\mathcal{C})$ of $\mathcal{C}$ is the simplicial set obtained by defining $N(\mathcal{C})_k$ to be the set of $k$ -tuples of composable morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ , together with the obvious face and degeneracy maps. To any simplicial set we can associate a CW complex by taking its geometric realization . Intuitively, this means we replace every element of $N(\mathcal{C})_k$ by a $k$ -dimensional triangle (the case $k = 0$ being a point), and gluing them according to the face maps. In particular, we may apply this procedure to the nerve of a category. I believe the resulting space is sometimes called the classifying space of your category. In some sense, one can think of the space as a tangible and geometric way to represent your category, especially if the category we care about is small. This leads me to the following question. Question. What does the classifying space of a category $\mathcal{C}$ look like when $\mathcal{C}$ is an (essentially small) algebraic category? Is it interesting to look at? Can we describe its algebraic invariants, such as the fundamental group or homology groups? For the sake of concreteness, let us specifically focus on the category of all finitely generated groups. But feel free to think about other cases, like the category of finite commutative rings. More geometrically minded people might want to think about the category of finite-type $S$ -schemes or the category of smooth manifolds. Note. The aforementioned categories are not small, though they are essentially small. Of course, one can simply take the skeleton of the essentially small category to obtain a small one, so that the resulting classifying spaces are actual sets. What I tried. A simpler example would be to take the category of all finitely generated abelian groups, which has the advantage that they admit a nice classification. Writing down the definition of this 'space' is not too complicated, but I did not manage to find a way to simplify the construction, let alone think about more complicated categories like the ones described above.","Let be a category. Recall that the nerve of is the simplicial set obtained by defining to be the set of -tuples of composable morphisms in , together with the obvious face and degeneracy maps. To any simplicial set we can associate a CW complex by taking its geometric realization . Intuitively, this means we replace every element of by a -dimensional triangle (the case being a point), and gluing them according to the face maps. In particular, we may apply this procedure to the nerve of a category. I believe the resulting space is sometimes called the classifying space of your category. In some sense, one can think of the space as a tangible and geometric way to represent your category, especially if the category we care about is small. This leads me to the following question. Question. What does the classifying space of a category look like when is an (essentially small) algebraic category? Is it interesting to look at?
