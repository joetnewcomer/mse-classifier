(For example, introduce nilpotents to a closed point on a positive dimensional integral $k$ scheme. ) However, this is true if the map is assumed to be finite, and $X$ is assumed to be irreducible.

1,Complements of subobjects and algebraic geometry,Complements of subobjects and algebraic geometry,,"This is an idle question, I don't really have any particular application in mind. In any category $C$ , for any object $c \in C$ we can consider its subobjects, namely monomorphisms $d \hookrightarrow c$ . If the objects of $C$ are ""sufficiently spacelike"" we might hope that subobjects have complements , in the following sense. Say that two subobjects are disjoint if their intersection (pullback) is trivial (the initial object). Definition: The complement of a subobject $d \hookrightarrow c$ , if it exists, is the terminal subobject $\neg d \hookrightarrow c$ which is disjoint from $d$ . This recovers the usual notion of the complement of a subset of a set, for example. The definition makes sense more generally in any preorder and if applied to a Heyting algebra , such as the open subsets of a topological space, recovers the Heyting complement. Here is the example which motivates this question. Take $C$ to be the category of functors $\text{CRing} \to \text{Set}$ and consider first the usual forgetful functor $U$ which sends a commutative ring $R$ to its underlying set. This functor has a subfunctor $\{ 0 \}$ sending a commutative ring $R$ to the set consisting of its additive identity $ \{ 0 \}$ . Now we can ask: what is the complement of this subfunctor, if any? There is a ""naive complement"" given by $R \mapsto R \setminus \{ 0 \}$ , but this is not a functor, because elements that are nonzero in some commutative ring may become zero after applying a homomorphism. So we have to ""functorialize"" this construction: we need to know what elements $r$ of a commutative ring $R$ are not only nonzero but remain nonzero after the application of any nonzero homomorphism. (Something goes wrong here with the zero ring; I am just going to ignore this for now.) This is equivalent to requiring that $r$ is not in any proper ideal, which means that the ideal $(r)$ generated by $r$ must be the unit ideal; hence this condition is equivalent to requiring that $r$ be invertible. We conclude that the complement of the zero subfunctor is the group $R^{\times}$ of units. In terms of functors of points, this lets us describe abstractly the sense in which the punctured affine line $\mathbb{A}^1 \setminus \{ 0 \} = \text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}[x, x^{-1}]$ is the complement of the origin in $\mathbb{A}^1$ ! Now we can take complements again , and ask: what is the complement of $R^{\times}$ in $R$ ? (Something again goes wrong here with the zero ring, which I am again going to ignore.) There is a ""naive complement"" $R \mapsto R \setminus R^{\times}$ sending a ring to its non-units, it is not a functor because a non-unit may become a unit after applying a homomorphism, so we need to ""functorialize"" and understand what elements $r \in R$ are not only non-units but remain non-units after the application of any nonzero homomorphism. If $r$ is not contained in some prime ideal $P$ then it becomes a unit in the fraction field $\text{Frac}(R/P)$ ; therefore $r$ must be contained in every prime ideal, and hence in their intersection, which is the nilradical. So $r$ must be nilpotent. Conversely nilpotents clearly satisfy the desired property, and so the complement of $R^{\times}$ is $\text{Nil}(R)$ . $\text{Nil}(R)$ is not representable but it is close: it is ""pro-representable"" by the rings $\mathbb{Z}[x]/x^n$ which organize into a cofiltered limit $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]$ (equipped with the $x$ -adic topology). Geometrically this says that the complement of the punctured affine line in $\mathbb{A}^1$ is not the origin again but its formal neighborhood, which is quite nice and seems to have something to do with the Beauville-Laszlo theorem . If only I knew what was going on with the zero ring! The problem is that all of these functors assign the zero ring its unique element $\{ 0 \}$ (since it is both invertible and nilpotent), so none of them are technically disjoint! So, now my actual Question: Has anyone seen this notion of the complement of a subobject applied to functors of points in algebraic geometry in particular? Also, what's going on with the zero ring above and how do we fix it? I have not thought about whether we should really be working in the category of Zariski sheaves or whatever else; if someone can explain how that might fix the zero ring issue I'd be grateful. Edit: Okay, I have a guess. Everything would be fixed if we worked in Zariski sheaves and the initial sheaf was not the initial presheaf, but was instead the sheaf that assigns the empty set to every nonzero ring but assigns $1$ to the zero ring. That alters the definition of disjointness in exactly the right way to allow all of the above functors to be disjoint. Is that right? Then we'd just need to check that $\text{Nil}(R)$ is a Zariski sheaf, which I think is true?","This is an idle question, I don't really have any particular application in mind.

7,Algebraicity of compact Riemann surfaces,Algebraicity of compact Riemann surfaces,,"I am taking a course in Riemann surfaces, in which the classical result about algebraicity of compact riemann Surfaces has been proven. However, I think there are some dubious points in the proof. Here is the outline: let X be our compact connected Riemann surface, let g be its genus. If D is a divisor whose degree d satisfies $d\geq2g+1$ , then the associated map $\varphi_{|D|}:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^N(\mathbb{C})$ , with $N=d-g$ , is a holomorphic embedding, so $Y=\varphi_{|D|}(X)$ is a closed submanifold of dimension $1$ in $\mathbb{P}^N$ . Now consider the graded $\mathbb{C}$ -algebra $R(D):=\bigoplus_{n\geq0} H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$ , with multiplication given by the product of global sections. Using what has been presented as the Castelnuovo-Mumford theorem, under these conditions there exists, for every $n\geq0$ , a natural surjection $$ H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D))^{\otimes n}\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$$ which sends $s_1\otimes\dots\otimes s_n$ to $s_1\dots s_n$ . Indeed, since the product of sections is commutative, we obtain a surjection $$ \mathrm{Sym}^n(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)))\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D)) $$ whence a surjective map $$ \mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_N]_n\rightarrow H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(n\cdot D))$$ where $\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots,z_N]_n\cong\mathrm{Sym}^n(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D)))$ is the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ . Assembling these maps together, we obtain a surjective homomorphism of algebras $$ \alpha:\mathbb{C}[z_0,\dots, z_N]\rightarrow R(D)$$ whose kernel $I$ is a homogeneous ideal by construction of $\alpha$ ; therefore we can define the projective variety $Z=V(I)\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N$ . Furthermore, since $R(D)$ is a domain, $I$ is prime and $Z$ is irreducible. Using the isomorphism $\mathbb{C}[z_o,\dots,z_N]/I\cong R(D)$ and applying the Riemann-Roch theorem, we can see that the Hilbert polynomial of $Z$ is $p_Z(t)=\mathrm{deg}(D)t+1-g$ , so by the Hilbert-Serre theorem $Z$ has dimension $1$ (here by dimension I mean the supremum of the lengths of chains of irreducible subvarieties). Now a straightforward calculation shows $Y\subseteq Z$ . Furthermore, $Y$ is irreducible in the Zariski topology and has dimension $1$ being the image of $X$ via an embedding (here I mean, a priori, the dimension as a complex manifold). This implies $Y=Z$ . Here are my doubts: Why is $Y$ irreducible? My guess: suppose there exist homogeneous polynomials $F_1,\dots,F_r, G_1,\dots, G_s$ such that $Y=(Y\cap V(F_1,\dots,F_r))\cup (Y\cap V(G_1,\dots, G_s))$ . If $Y\cap V(F_1,\dots,F_r)$ is a proper non empty subset of $Y$ , its complement in $Y$ is open and contained in every $Y\cap V(G_j)$ . Since the restrictions of the $G_j$ on $Y$ , which is a Riemann surface, are holomorphic, they must be identically zero on $Y$ , hence $Y\subset V(G_1,\dots,G_s)$ . $Y$ is certainly a $1$ -dimensional complex manifold, but why is it $1$ -dimensional as a topological space with the Zariski topology? My guess: let $C$ be a Zariski closed subset of $\mathbb{P}^N$ : then $Y\cap C$ is either $Y$ or a finite set of points, by holomorphicity of the functions defining $C$ and compactness and ""one-dimensionality"" of $Y$ . If $Y\cap C$ is a proper Zariski irreducible subset of $Y$ , then it must be a point. Assuming the two previous points, why does the equality of the dimensions imply $Y=Z$ ? It would certainly be true if $Y$ were Zariski closed in $Z$ , but then $Y$ would be Zariski closed in $\mathbb{P}^N$ , which is exactly what we want.

In this document, the authors defin the notion of Deligne categories, $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t)$ , let me give a rough introduction to this sort of categories and what I am confused about. One of the main interest of this paper is neutral Tannakian categories, which can be defined in two equivalent ways: A category $\mathcal{C}$ which is rigid abelian tensor such that $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{1})=k$ is a field ( $\mathbf{1}$ is ""the"" identity object) and $\mathcal{C}$ is equipped with an exact faithful $k$ -linear tensor functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Vect}_k$ , the latter category indicates the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over $k$ . Such a functor, if exists, is called a fiber functor. The category $\mathrm{Rep}_k(G)$ consists of finite dimensional representations of a given affine group scheme $G$ over $k$ , i.e. its objects are pairs $(V,\rho)$ , $\mathrm{dim}_k(V) < +\infty$ and $\rho: G \to GL_V$ is considered as a morphism of functors $k-\mathbf{Alg} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ . The fiber functor in this case is just the forgetful functor. The purpose of the last example $1.27$ in chapter $1$ in DM's note is to show a counterexample, i.e. a rigid tensor abelian category such that $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{1})$ is a field but it can not be endowed a fibered functor. The key point is to look at categorical ranks of objects. Ranks in $\mathrm{Rep}_k(G)$ are nonnegative integers, here Deligne creates catgories with ranks are intermediates. Let denote $\mathcal{C}_0$ be the category with objects are symbols $T^{a,b}$ ( $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ ), morphism sets $$\mathrm{Hom}(T^{a,b},T^{c,d}) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}[t][S_{a+d}] & \text{if} \ a + d = b + c \\ 0 & \text{other cases} \end{cases}.$$ The tensor product is simply $T^{a,b} \otimes T^{c,d} = T^{a+c,b+d}$ . Define $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C_0}^{add}$ be the additive envelope of $\mathcal{C_0}$ , i.e. formally adding direct sums. This category fails the positivity because $\mathrm{rank}(T^{1,0})=t$ is not in $\mathbb{N}$ , the ground ring, however, is $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ , not a field so we extend it to $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ to obtain a new category, let denote it by $\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathbb{Q}(t)$ . Finally, we consider the Karoubian envelope $(\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathbb{Q}(t))^{kar}=\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t)$ (formally adjoining images of idempotents) this category has several properties: $\mathrm{rank}(T^{1,0})$ is not an integer, of course! The endormophism set of every object is semisimple algebra by using Maschke theorem, as they are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}(t)[S]$ for certain symmetric group $S$ . It is Karoubian, i.e. every idempotent has image. First question . That is, this category is ""almost"" rigid abelian tensor and what I want to prove is to prove it is indeed abelian , I don't have a clue to this so many thanks for any suggestion. Second question . Deligne wrote down an isomorphism for $$\mathrm{Hom}(T^{a,b},T^{c,d}) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[t]} \mathbb{C} \to \mathrm{Hom}_{GL_V}(V^{\otimes a} \otimes V^{* \otimes b}, V^{\otimes c} \otimes V^{* \otimes d}).$$ in which $V$ is finite-dim $\mathbb{C}$ -vector space and $n=\mathrm{dim}(V) \geq a + d$ , $\mathbb{C}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ algebra under the morphism $\mathbb{Z}[t] \to \mathbb{C}, t \mapsto n$ . My question here is what exactly is the morphism above? Why should we consider the action of $GL_V$ here? I guess the RHS is somehow related to Schur-Weyl duality but I cannot write it explicitly.

The first question is done, it is a special of theorem $2$ in U. Jannsen, Motives, numerical equivalence, and semi-simplicity .

Many thanks! Let $\rho:\mathbb{P}^n\to \mathbb{P}^N$ be the Veronese embedding (where $N=\binom{n+d}{d}-1$ ). Let $S$ be the set of multi-indices: $$\{(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n) \, : \, \text{each } i_j \in \{0,1,\ldots,d\} \text{ and } i_0+i_1+\ldots+i_n=d\}.$$ Let $\theta:k\big[\{y_I \, : \, I \in S\}\big] \to k[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ be the $k$ -algebra homomorphism such that $$\theta(y_I)=x_0^{i_0}x_1^{i_1}\ldots x_n^{i_n} \; \; \; \; \forall I \in S.$$ I want to show that $\mathrm{im}\,\rho=Z(\ker\theta)$ and that $\rho$ is a homeomorphism onto its image. My proposed solution follows... 1) I show that $\rho$ maps $\mathbb{P}^n$ injectively into $Z(\ker\theta).$ For any $(a_0:a_1:\ldots:a_n) \in \mathbb{P}^n$ and any $f \in \ker(\theta),$ we have $$f(\rho(a_0:a_1:\ldots:a_n))=\theta(f)(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n)=0.$$ Moreover, if $\rho(a)=\rho(b)$ for some $a,b \in \mathbb{P}^n$ with $a_i\neq 0,$ then $$a=(a_0a_i^{d-1}:\ldots:a_i^d:\ldots:a_na_i^{d-1})=(b_0b_i^{d-1}:\ldots:b_i^d:\ldots:b_nb_i^{d-1})=b.$$ Thus $\rho$ realises $\mathbb{P}^n$ as a subset of $Z(\ker\theta).$ 2) I construct local inverses to $\rho.$ Observe that, for each $(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in S,$ we have the relation: $$d\cdot(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n)=i_0\cdot(d,0,\ldots,0)+\ldots+i_n\cdot(0,\ldots,0,d).$$ It follows from this that the $n+1$ affine-open patches $U_{(d,0,\ldots,0)},\ldots,U_{(0,\ldots,0,d)}$ cover $Z(\ker\theta).$ Define a map $\sigma_0:U_{(d,0,\ldots,0)}\cap Z(\ker\theta)\longrightarrow U_0\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ as follows $$\sigma_0(b)=(b_{(d,0,\ldots,0)}:b_{(d-1,1,0,\ldots,0)}:\ldots:b_{(d-1,0,\ldots,0,1)}).$$ For each $(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n) \in S,$ we have the relation: \begin{align*}i_0\cdot(d,0,\ldots,0)+i_1\cdot(d-1,1,0,\ldots,0)+\ldots&+i_n\cdot(d-1,0,\ldots,0,1)\\[1em] &=(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_n)+(d-1)\cdot(d,0,\ldots,0).\end{align*} It follows from this that $(\rho\circ\sigma_0)(b)=b$ for all $b \in U_{(d,0,\ldots,0)}\cap Z(\ker\theta).$ Furthermore, it is clear that $(\sigma_0\circ\rho)(a)=a$ for all $a \in U_0,$ and so $\sigma_0$ and $\rho|_{U_0}$ are mutually inverse bijections. In a similar fashion, for each $i=1,\ldots,n,$ we construct a map $\sigma_i:U_{(0,\ldots,0,d,0,\ldots,0)}\cap Z(\ker\theta) \longrightarrow U_j$ inverse to $\rho|_{U_i}.$ 3) I show that the $\sigma_i$ can be glued together to form a global inverse for $\rho.$ If $b \in \mathrm{dom}(\sigma_i)\cap\mathrm{dom}(\sigma_j)$ for $i\neq j,$ then $\rho(\sigma_i(b))=b=\rho(\sigma_j(b))$ and so $\sigma_i(b)=\sigma_j(b)$ since $\rho$ is injective by (1) .

A torus $T$ is an affine variety isomorphic to $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ , where $T$ inherits a group structure from the isomorphism. Now, my understanding of the definition of an affine variety, as per Hartshorne is a subset $A$ of affine $n$ -space over an algebraically closed field $k$ , such that $A = Z(B)$ , i.e. $A$ is the zero-locus of some set $B\subset k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ . My question is, why is it stated that $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ is an affine variety? What set of polynomials is it the zero-locus of?

I also have the canonical ring defined as the graded $\mathbb{C}$ algebra $$R(X):= \bigoplus_{n\geq 0} H^{0}(X,nK_{X})$$ I would like to show that $\dim R(X)-1=k(X)$ when $k(X) \geq 0$ . My idea was to let $Q(D)=Frac{H^{0}(X,D)} \subseteq \mathbb{C}(X)$ for any divisor $D$ . It's clear that $Q(D)=Q(D')$ whenever $D,D'$ are effective and linearly equivalent. Then choosing $D_{n} \in |nK_{X}|$ for every possible $n$ we can take $Q=\bigcup_{n \geq 0} Q(D_{n})$ . We can identify $R(X)$ with the subring $$\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} L(nK_{X})t^{n}\subseteq \mathbb{C}(V)(t)$$ . If we fix an $n$ we can take $f$ s.t $D=nK_{x} +(f)$ . Then for any $m$ and any $g \in H^{0}(X, mK_{X})$ we have $D'=(g^{n})+nmK_{X} \sim mD$ and in fact $D'=mD+(g^{n}f^{-m})$ but $D'$ is effective so we have $g^{n}f^{-m}\in Q(mD)\subseteq Q$ . Thus $gt^{m}$ is algebraic over $Q(ft^{n})$ , so we must have $Frac(R(X))$ algebraic over $Q(ft^{n})$ . In particular then $\dim (R(X))= Trdeg(Frac(R(X))=Trdeg(Q)+1$ .  We must have that Q is algebraic over $Q(D_{N})$ for some $N$ as $\mathbb{C}(X)$ has finite transcendence degree, thus $\dim R(X)= Trdeg(Q(D_{N})+1$ . I am pretty sure but not 100% certain that $Q(D_{n}) \cong \mathbb{C}( \phi_{|D_{n}|}(X))$ So we have $\dim R(X)-1=Trdeg(Q(D_{n}))=\dim \phi_{|D_{n}|}(X)+1$ , which is very close to what I wanted to show, but sadly not quite right.

My question is about the “if” part, stalks being integral means they are reduced. What remains is the irreducibility of $X$ .

The paper claims that this space is homeomorphic to the Klein bottle, however I'm struggling with some of the details. Specifically, it says that the space $P$ of all polynomials in two variables (i.e. $f(x,y) = b_0 + b_1x+b_2y + b_3x^2 + b_4 xy + b_5 y^2$) such that $\int \int_D f = 0$ and  $\int \int_D f^2 = 1$ is homeomorphic to a 4-dimensional ellipsoid. That part I proved and agree with. From there, we consider the subspace $X$ of $P$. Plugging into the constraint $\int\int_D p(x,y) \ dx dy = 0$ gives me that $e = -\frac{1}{4} c (a^2+b^2)$, so $X$ has polynomials of the form $c(ax+by)^2 + d(ax+by) - \frac{c(a^2+b^2)}{4}$. Plugging into the constraint $\int \int_D p^2(x,y) \ dxdy = 1$ gave me an algebra mess. The text says to consider the function $g:S^1 \times S^1 \rightarrow c(ax+by)^2 + d(ax+by),$ which is onto and has the relations $g(a,b,c,d) = g(-a,-b,c,-d)$. So letting $\theta = (a,b) \in S^1$ and $\phi = (c,d) \in S^1$, we have $(a,b) \sim (-a,-b) = \theta + \pi$ and $(c,d)  \sim (c,-d) = 2\pi - \phi$. Then since $g$ is surjective onto $\{c(ax+by)^2 + d(ax+by) \mid a^2+b^2 = c^2 + d^2 = 1\} \equiv Y$, we have $Y = \text{Im}(g) = S^1 \times S^1 \big/ [(\theta,\phi) \sim (\theta+\pi, 2\pi-\phi)] = K$ (the Klein bottle). However, we want $X$ (not $Y$) to be homeomorphic to $K$. My question is: how can we get a homeomorphism from $X$ to $K$? I know that: $Y$ is a subset of a 4-dimensional ellipsoid (which is homeomorphic to $S^4$), so I could consider $g:S^4 \rightarrow Y$ such that $g(a,b,c,d) = c(ax+by)^2 + d(ax+by) - \frac{c(a^2+b^2)}{4}$, which has the same relations $(a,b,c,d) \sim (-a,-b,c,-d)$. So $Y$ could be homeomorphic to $S^4 \big/ [(a,b,c,d) \sim(-a,-b,c,-d)]$, but I don't see how those identifications on $S^4$ yield a Klein bottle. (Also letting $(a,b) = \theta, (c,d) = \phi$ seems wrong since $(a,b), (c,d)$ each don't necessarily lie on a copy of $S^1$. ) I also know that the space $A$ of single variable quadratic functions $q(t) = -\frac{c(a^2+b^2)}{4} + c t + dt^2$ in $X$ form an ellipse ($\frac{d^2}{4\pi}+\frac{9c^2}{72\pi}) = 1$, which is homeomorphic to $S^1$. (Plugging these functions into $\int\int_D q = 0$ and $\int\int_D q^2 = 0$ is much easier.)

31,Jacobians of curves and products of abelian varieties,Jacobians of curves and products of abelian varieties,,"According to a previously asked question on MSE ( Is $M_g$ NEVER proper? And why does $T_g$ contain products? ), the Jacobian of a curve cannot be a product of principally polarized abelian varieties. What is the reasoning behind this statement? I know that the closure of the image of the Torelli map $\mathcal{M}_g \xrightarrow{j} \mathcal{A}_g$ sending a curve to its Jacobian is made up of products of Jacobians, but it's not clear to me why the actual image of the map can't contain such points (or of principally polarized abelian varieties in general). I did find a paper which had a generalization of the Torelli theorem (i.e. $j$ is injective) for a map from a compactification $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g$ which seems to indicate that two stable curves can have the same image in this extended Torelli map only if they are both singular if at least one of them is singular (actually have more precise conditions -- in fact, the authors obtain an if and only if condition: see http://www.mat.uniroma3.it/users/caporaso/tostJEMSproofs.pdf for more details). Even with this, I guess it doesn't really finish the question since there are a lot of principally polarized abelian varieties that aren't isomorphic (or even isogenous) to a Jacobian. Is there a simpler reason why the statement should be true? If so, how should I think about this? Also, does paper mentioned above actually apply to the situation that I'm thinking about?

In fact, products of elliptic curves $E_1 \times E_2$ with the product polarization are the only products of elliptic curves treated as principally polarized abelian varieties which are not isomorphic to the Jacobian of a genus $2$ curve with the associated canonical principal polarization (see ``Zum Beweis des Torellischen Satzes'' by Weil).

Let $\mathfrak m$ be a maximal ideal of $A$.  Then $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ is a prime ideal of $A$.  Here is my very general question: When is $\mathfrak m \cap A_0$ a maximal ideal of $A$? Another point of view would be to use the fact that since $k$ is algebraically closed, there is a unique $k$-algebra homomorphism $\phi: A \rightarrow k$ whose kernel is $\mathfrak m$.

The idea is to show that the set $S$ of divisors $D \in X^d$ such that there exists $D' \sim D$ and points $P,Q \in X$ with $E = D'-P-Q$ an effective special divisor has dimension $\leq g+2$ .

We fix an algebraically closed field $\Omega$ which has infinite trancendence dimension over the prime subfield. Let $k$ be a subfield of $\Omega$ such that tr.dim $\Omega/k = \infty$. Let $X$ be a topological space. We denote by $\mathcal{F}_X$ the sheaf of $\Omega$-valued functions on $X$. We regard $\mathcal{F}_X$ as a sheaf of $k$-algebras in the obvious way. Let $\mathcal{O}_X$ be a $k$-algebra subsheaf of $\mathcal{F}_X$. Namely, $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)$ is a $k$-subalgebra of $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{F}_X)$ for every open subset $U$ of $X$ and the application $U \rightarrow \Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_X)$ defines a subsheaf of $\mathcal{F}_X$. We call the pair $(X, \mathcal{O}_X)$ a $k$-space. By abuse of notation, we usually say $X$ is a $k$-space. Let $X, Y$ be $k$-spaces. Let $f\colon X \rightarrow Y$ be a continuous map. Let $U$ be any open subset of $Y$. Suppose $\psi\circ f \in \Gamma(f^{-1}(U), \mathcal{O}_X)$ for any $\psi \in \Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_Y)$.

It is easy to see that by taking subsets of the form $V(E)$ as closed sets, we can define a topology in $\Omega^n$. We call this topology $k$-topology.

Anyways, I don't see any statement that says that must then be an algebraic curve (i.e. a complex projective variety of dim 1), and I would appreciate it if anybody gave me a reference or a proof of this particular step. And just to be clear: I know there are other proofs that is algebraic, but I am looking for the one Hartshorne is referring to here.  And of course I see the generalized Riemann existence theorem he states right after which is much more high-powered, but I'd like the elementary argument Hartshorne refers to.",X \mathbb{P}^1 X \mathbb{P}^1 X Y d X\rightarrow Y X X,"['algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'riemann-surfaces']"
