Notation here $\mathcal{S}$ is the Schwartz Class. $\mathrm{C}_0^\infty$ means smooth functions with compact support. $\tau^y$ means translation by $y$ , that is, $(\tau^yf)(x):=f(x-y).$ $\partial_j$ means the partial derivative on the $j$ -th component. For multi-index $\beta=(\beta_1,\beta_2,\cdots,\beta_n)$ and $x=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , $|\beta|:=\beta_1+\beta_2+\cdots+\beta_n,$ and $$\partial^\beta f(x):=\frac{\partial^{|\beta|}}{\partial^{\beta_1}_{x_1}\cdots\partial^{\beta_n}_{x_n}}f(x).$$ $e_j$ is  the elementary vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$ : $1$ on the $j$ -th component and $0$ on the others. And $e_j$ can also be viewed as a multi-index. $\hat{f}$ is the Fourier transform of $f$ . Problem here $2.3.5.$ Let $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $\varphi\in\mathrm{C}_0^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be identically equal to 1 in a neighbourhood of the origin. Define $\varphi_k(x)=\varphi(x/k)$ as in the proof of Proposition $2.3.23$ .

Grafakos left some details in that proposition as exercise here. And if you need further explanations for anything above, please comment to let me know.) The following is what I have done. To prove (a), for any multi-indices $\alpha,\beta$ , $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ , $$|x^\alpha\partial^\beta(\frac{\tau^{-he_j}f(x)-f(x)}{h}-\partial_jf(x))|=|x^\alpha\cdot\frac{\partial^\beta f(x+he_j)-\partial^\beta f(x)-\partial^{\beta+e_j}f(x)h}{h}|$$ Use the mean value theorem and this semi-norm of $f$ in $\mathcal{S}$ : $\sup\limits_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}|x^\alpha\partial^{\beta+2e_j}f(x)|$ to prove the result. $~$ To prove (b), suppose $\varphi$ equals to $1$ on $B(0,R):=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n:|x|<R\}$ . Then for multi-indices $\alpha,\beta$ , we split the semi-norm into two parts after using Leibniz's rule: $$|x^\alpha\partial^\beta(\varphi_kf-f)|=|x^\alpha(\sum\limits_{0<\gamma\leq\beta}\tbinom{\beta}{\gamma} \partial^\gamma\varphi_k ~ \partial^{\beta-\gamma}f)+x^\alpha(\varphi_k-1)\partial^\beta f|.$$ The sum is taken over multi-index $\gamma$ , where (the partial order on multi-indices) $\gamma\leq\beta$ means $\gamma_j\leq\beta_j$ for every $j\in\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ , and $\gamma>0$ means $\gamma\geq0$ as multi-index but $\gamma\not=0.$ Use the fact that $\varphi_k-1$ and $\partial^\gamma\varphi_k(\gamma>0)$ vanish on $B(0,kR)$ to help prove the result. $~$ Now prove (c). It is really tempting to prove (c) with (b), because (b) says that the sequence $\{\varphi_k\}_{k\geq1}$ approximates the identity map. So, it seems that $\widehat{\varphi_kf}$ is almost $\hat{f}$ . Then $\varphi_k\widehat{\varphi_kf}$ is almost $\varphi_k\hat{f}$ , and thus almost $\hat{f}.$ But actually it doesn't make sense! To be rigorous, consider the sequence with two indices: $\{\varphi_j(\widehat{\varphi_kf})\}_{k,j\geq1}$ . Fix any one of $k,j$ and let the other $\to\infty$ , for example fix $k$ and let $j\to\infty$ , we get the limit $\widehat{\varphi_kf}$ , then we let $k\to\infty$ to get $\hat{f}.$ The same result if we first let $k\to\infty$ then let $j\to\infty$ .

Theorem1 :If $M$ be a close subspace of a normed vector space $X$ which is $X\neq M$ , then for all $\varepsilon>0$ there is $u_{\varepsilon}\in X$ such that $\|u_{\varepsilon}\|=1,d(u,M)>1-\varepsilon$ ï¼ Theorem2 :By Theorem 1, if $M$ is finite dimensional, we can get $u_0\in X$ such that $\|u_0\|=1,d(u_0,M)\geq1$ . I think I will use these theorems, but I can't think of a specific way to do it. Also, from a geometric point of view, if $X$ is one-dimensional (line), we can get $x_1\in X$ where $\|x_1\|=1$ . If $X$ is two-dimensional (plane), then by drawing an equilateral triangle with one point at the origin, we can obtain $x_1,x_2\in X$ such that $\|x_i\|=1\ (i=1,2),\|x_1-x_2\|=1$ . Furthermore, if $X$ is three-dimensional (space), by considering a regular square pyramid with a single point at the origin, we can obtain $x_1,x_2,x_3\in X$ such that $\|x_i\|=1\ (i=1,2,3),\|x_i-x_j\|=1\ (i\neq j)$ .

From Theorem 2 , we obtain $x_3\in X$ such that $\|x_3\|=1$ and $d(x_3,M_2)\geq 1$ . Continuing this work, let $M_n$ be a finite dimensional subspace of $X$ spaned by $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ . From Theorem 2 , we obtain $X_{n+1}\in X$ such that $\|x_{n+1}\|=1$ and $d(x_{n+1},M_n)\geq 1$ . Assume that this task is completed in a finite number of times. In this case, $X$ is a finite dimensional space, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this work can be done infinitely many times. In this case, $\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ satisfies $\|x_n\|=1\ (n=1,2,\cdots)$ , and from $d(x_{n+1},M_n)\geq 1$ , we can say $1\leq\|x_n-x_m\|$ for $n\neq m$ .

10,Elementary tensors of pure states separate the points of the spatial tensor product,Elementary tensors of pure states separate the points of the spatial tensor product,,"Let $A,B$ be two $C^*$ -algebras. Given two states $\phi\in S(A),\psi\in S(B)$ one defines the elementary tensor state $\phi\odot\psi:A\odot B\to\mathbb{C}$ as the unique linear map satisfying $\phi\odot\psi(a\otimes b)=\phi(a)\psi(b)$ on elementary tensors. One proves with elementary arguments that all such functionals are algebraically positive and continuous with respect to the spatial norm (and by Takesaki's theorem w.r.t any $C^*$ -norm on $A\odot B$ ). Denote the extension of $\phi\odot\psi$ on a state on $A\otimes B$ (the spatial TP) by $\phi\otimes\psi\in S(A\otimes B)$ . Let $0\neq x\in A\otimes B$ . It is easily proven that there exist states $\phi\in S(A)$ and $\psi\in S(B)$ so that $\phi\otimes\psi(x^*x)>0$ . Here is a simple argument: As seen in Murphy, we have that $$\|x^*x\|_{\min}=\sup_{\tau\in S(A),\rho\in S(B)}\|\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho(x^*x)\|_{B(H_\tau\otimes H_\rho)}$$ where $(H_\tau,\pi_\tau,\xi_\tau)$ is the GNS triplet. So we find a pair of states $\tau,\rho$ such that $\|\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho((x^*x)^{1/2})\|\neq0$ , i.e. $\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho((x^*x)^{1/2})\neq0$ . This thing here is an operator on $H_\tau\otimes H_\rho$ , i.e. $\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho((x^*x)^{1/2})\in B(H_\tau\otimes H_\rho)$ , and as it is non-zero, we can find unit vectors $\xi_1\in H_\tau,\xi_2\in H_\rho$ such that $\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho((x^*x)^{1/2})(\xi_1\otimes\xi_2)\neq0$ . Simply set $\phi(a)=\langle\pi_\tau(a)\xi_1,\xi_1\rangle$ and $\psi(b)=\langle\pi_\rho(b)\xi_2,\xi_2\rangle$ . These are obviously states on $A$ and $B$ , and $\phi\otimes\psi(x^*x)\neq0$ . Here is my question : apparently it is also true that the elementary tensors of pure states separate the positive elements, i.e. given $0\neq x\in (A\otimes B)_+$ , we can find pure states $\phi\in\text{PS}(A),\psi\in\text{PS}(B)$ such that $\phi\otimes\psi(x)\neq0$ . How can this be proved, or where can I find a proof? Here are the things I tried With elementary arguments as those presented in Murphy's book, I was able to show that we also have $$\|x\|_{\min}=\sup_{\tau\in\text{PS}(A),\rho\in\text{PS}(B)}\|\pi_\tau\otimes\pi_\rho(x)\|_{B(H_\tau\otimes H_\rho)}$$ the proof is the same but one has to observe first that the direct sum of the GNS representations for pure states $\bigoplus_{\tau\in\text{PS}(A)}\pi_\tau:A\to\mathbb{B}(\bigoplus_{\tau\in\text{PS}(A)}H_\tau)$ are faithful. The thing is that, if I try to mimic the above proof, the rest of the proof gets messed up: If I knew that the vectors $\xi_1,\xi_2$ found earlier are the canonical cyclic vectors, then everything would work out like a charm since the resulting states $\phi,\psi$ would actually be $\tau$ and $\rho$ which would be pure this time. But of course this is too much to expect I guess. Also, one can show (similarly to the other equations) that $$\|x^*x\|_{\min}=\sup\bigg\{\frac{\tau\otimes\rho(y^*x^*xy)}{\tau\otimes\rho(y^*y)}:\tau\in\text{PS}(A),\rho\in\text{PS}(B),y\in A\odot B\text{ s.t. }\tau\otimes\rho(y^*y)\neq0\bigg\}.$$ So we could start like this: $x^*x\neq0$ , so we get pure states $\tau,\rho$ and some $y\in A\odot B$ such that $\tau\otimes\rho(y^*x^*xy)\neq0$ . And everything would be perfect if there wasn't this $y$ appearing here. Another approach would be this product states on the tensor product *-algebra using the so-called slice map, but I want to consider elements of the entire $C^*$ -tensor product and not just the algebraic TP. That means that (among many other things) I'd have to extend the slice map to the spatial TP and I don't see this happening at the moment. edit: of course slice maps extend to the spatial tp, this is a simple corollary of the fact that the TP of two completely positive maps is again c.p.","Let be two -algebras.

Replying to a previous formulation of this question, Kavi Rama Murthy has shown that if $E$ is complete and separable and $\mu$ is nonnegative, then $\hat\mu$ is uniformly continuous. It is easy to see that his proof still works in the general case as long as we are assuming that $\mu$ is tight $^1$ , i.e. $$\forall\varepsilon>0:\exists K\subseteq E\text{ compact}:|\mu|(K^c)<\varepsilon\tag1.$$ Taking a closer look at the proof, I've observed the following: Let $\langle\;\cdot\;,\;\cdot\;\rangle$ denote the duality pairing between $E$ and $E'$ and $$p_x(\varphi):=|\langle x,\varphi\rangle|\;\;\;\text{for }\varphi\in E'$$ for $x\in E$ . By definition, the weak* topology $\sigma(E',E)$ on $E'$ is the topology generated by the seminorm family $(p_x)_{x\in E}$ . Now, if $K\subseteq E$ is compact, $$p_K(\varphi):=\sup_{x\in K}p_x(\varphi)\;\;\;\text{for }\varphi\in E'$$ should be a seminorm on $E'$ as well. And if I'm not missing something, the topology generated by $(p_K:K\subseteq E\text{ is compact})$ is precisely the topology $\sigma_c(E',E)$ of compact convergence on $E'$ . What Kavi Rama Murthy has shown is that, since $\mu$ is tight, for all $\varepsilon>0$ , there is a compact $K\subseteq E$ and a $\delta>0$ with $$|\hat\mu(\varphi_1)-\hat\mu(\varphi_2)|<\varepsilon\;\;\;\text{for all }\varphi_1,\varphi_2\in E'\text{ with }p_K(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)<\delta\tag2.$$ Question : Are we able to conclude that $\hat\mu$ is $\sigma_c(E',E)$ -continuous? EDIT : In order to conclude that $\hat\mu$ is (uniformly) $\sigma_c(E',E)$ -continuous, we need to that $(2)$ holds for $K$ replaced by an arbitrary compact $\tilde K\subseteq E$ . Given $\varepsilon>0$ , we can show $(2)$ by choosing the compact subset $K\subseteq E$ such that $$|\mu|(K^c)<\varepsilon\tag3.$$ We may then write \begin{equation}\begin{split}\left|\hat\mu(\varphi_1)-\hat\mu(\varphi_2)\right|&\le\underbrace{\int_{K\cap\tilde K}\left|e^{{\rm i}\varphi_1}-e^{{\rm i}\varphi_2}\right|{\rm d}\left|\mu\right|}_{<\:\varepsilon}\\&\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;+\int_{K\cap\tilde K^c}\left|e^{{\rm i}\varphi_1}-e^{{\rm i}\varphi_2}\right|{\rm d}\left|\mu\right|\\&\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;+\underbrace{\int_{K\cap\tilde K}\left|e^{{\rm i}\varphi_1}-e^{{\rm i}\varphi_2}\right|{\rm d}\left|\mu\right|}_{<\:2\varepsilon}\end{split}\tag4\end{equation} for all $\varphi_1,\varphi_2\in E'$ with $p_{\tilde K}(\varphi_1-\varphi_2)<\delta$ , where $$\delta:=\frac\varepsilon{\left\|\mu\right\|},$$ but I have no idea how we can control the second integral. EDIT 2 A ""proof"" of this claim can be (found in Linde's Probability in Banach Spaces ), but I have no idea why this proof is correct, since he is concluding the continuity immediately from $(2)$ (for a single $K$ ): Maybe we need to assume that $\mu$ is even Radon, i.e. that for all $B\in\mathcal (E)$ , there is a compact $C\subseteq E$ with $C\subseteq B$ and $|\mu|(B\setminus C)<\varepsilon$ . The author is actually imposing this assumption, but he obviously doesn't make use of it in his proof (he would need to consider an arbitrary compact $\tilde K\subseteq E$ , as I did above). $^1$ On a complete separable metric space, every finite signed measure is tight.","Let be a normed -vector space, be a finite signed measure on and denote the characteristic function of .

Suppose that we have two sequences $(n_k), (V_k)\subset H^1(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\Omega)$ that converge weakly in $H^1(\Omega)$ to some limit elements $n,V\in H^1(\Omega)$ , where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain $(d\in\{1,2,3\})$ . Further, assume that the sequences are uniformly bounded in $H^1(\Omega)$ and $L^\infty(\Omega)$ as well as weak-* convergent in $L^\infty(\Omega)$ to $n,V$ . The authors now argue that this is more than sufficient to show $$ \lim_{k\to\infty}\int_\Omega n_k\nabla V_k\cdot\nabla \varphi\;\text{d}x=\int_\Omega n\nabla V\cdot\nabla\varphi\;\text{d}x\quad\forall\varphi\in H^1(\Omega) $$ without giving more details. Here, $\nabla u$ denotes the weak derivative of $u$ . As I'm quite new to the topic, I tried to understand why this holds true. My approach was to consider the following: $$ \int_\Omega (n_k\nabla V_k-n\nabla V)\cdot\nabla\varphi\;\text{d}x=\int_\Omega n_k(\nabla V_k-\nabla V)\cdot\nabla\varphi\;\text{d}x+\int_\Omega (n_k-n)\nabla V\cdot\nabla\varphi\;\text{d}x. $$ We have that $\nabla V\cdot\nabla\varphi\in L^1(\Omega)$ and therefore the second integral tends to $0$ by the weak-* convergence of $(n_k)$ . However, the first integral is tricky for me. If there wasn't the term $n_k$ , one could see that the integral tends to $0$ because of the weak convergence of $V_k$ in $H^1(\Omega)$ . I could apply the Hoelder inequality to estimate $$ \left\vert\int_\Omega n_k(\nabla V_k-\nabla V)\cdot\nabla\varphi\;\text{d}x\right\vert\leq\Vert n_k\Vert_{L^\infty(\Omega)}\Vert \nabla V_k-\nabla V\Vert_{L^2(\Omega)}\Vert\nabla\varphi\Vert_{L^2(\Omega)} $$ but I don't know if $(\nabla V_k)$ strongly converges in $L^2(\Omega)$ .

29,On a result of Mazur about convergence in locally convex spaces,On a result of Mazur about convergence in locally convex spaces,,"My question is about the following result from Simon (2011) (Theorem 5.3). Let $X$ be a locally convex space and $Y$ its space of continuous [linear] functionals. Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence in $X$ with $x_n \to x_\infty$ in the $\sigma(X,Y)$ -topology. Then, $$ x_\infty = \bigcap_n \mathrm{cch}(\{x_m\}_{m\ge n}). $$ Here, $\sigma(X,Y)$ is the weak topology on $X$ with respect to $Y$ . For a set $A$ , $\mathrm{cch}(A)$ is the closed convex hull of $A$ . Note that $X$ may be endowed with a topology stronger than the weak topology (subject to the requirement that this topology gives $Y$ as its dual). The proof establishes fairly quickly that $x_\infty \in \cap_n \mathrm{cch}(\{x_m\}_{m\ge n})=:A$ . It is, however, silent on the (non-)existence of other points in $A$ . Thus, my question . How does one show that $x_\infty$ is the only member of $A$ ? For reference, here is the proof from the text. Let $C_n=\mathrm{cch}(\{x_m\}_{m\ge n})$ . If $x_\infty \notin C_n$ , there exists $y\in Y$ such that $ \langle y,x_\infty \rangle > \sup_{x\in C_n} \langle y,x\rangle \ge \sup_{m \ge n} \langle y, x_m \rangle$ . This is incompatible with $\langle y, x_n \rangle \to \langle y, x_\infty \rangle$ . If $X$ were a FrÃ©chet space, then the result might follow from a version of Cantor's Intersection Theorem.

31,Help understanding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces?,Help understanding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces?,,"I am trying to wrap my head around some concepts of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) without having a formal background in functional analysis. Since I am trying to form an intuition about what this space is and how it does what it does, I would appreciate it if you could double-check my reasoning. A RKHS belonging to a kernel $k(x,x')$ (evaluated at $x$ , centered on $x'$ ), $x,x' \in \mathcal{X}$ contains functions of the form $$f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\alpha_ik(x,x_i)$$ where $\alpha_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are some coefficients and $m \in \mathbb{N}$ is some number to which $i$ is counting the indices. Now RKHSs have inner products. The rules for inner products state that if I have two vectors $\textbf{a}=[a_1,a_2,...,a_m]$ and $\textbf{b}=[b_1,b_2,...,b_m]$ in some $m$ -dimensional vector space, then their inner product $\langle\textbf{a},\textbf{b}\rangle$ is: $$\langle\textbf{a},\textbf{b}\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_ib_i$$ One can see the similarity between the right-hand side of the first and second equation. So if we define $f(\cdot)=[\alpha_1,\alpha_2,...,\alpha_m]$ and $k(x,\cdot)=[k(x,x_1),k(x,x_2),...,k(x,x_m)]$ we could express $f(x)$ as an inner product in a RKHS $\mathcal{H}$ : $$f(x)=\langle f(\cdot),k(x,\cdot)\rangle_\mathcal{H}$$ That's the so-called reproducing property, if I understand correctly. Am I correct so far? If yes, I have a few questions: If the RKHS is a space, it should have a dimensionality (in our case $m$ ) and orthonormal bases. If we take a parameter space, for example, each of its dimension has a fixed interpretation (say, a 2-D space with dimensions $x=weight$ and $y=age$ allows for an inner product of two vectors, but both vectors will contain elements of the type $(weight,age)$ ). Now I can see how the expression in Equation 1 can be interpreted as an inner product, but the two vectors (albeit of equal length) contain different elements: $f(\cdot)$ is a vector of scalar coefficients, and $k(x,\cdot)$ is a vector of functions. They do not seem to share their bases in the same sense that the weight-age-example above would. Does this mean that the RKHS $\mathcal{H}$ is sort of a general-purpose space with no fixed definition as to what its dimensions represent, or is there a different interpretation I am missing? My second question relates to the dimensionality $m$ (which I adopted from the Wikipedia article). The way I understand it, this dimensionality $m$ relates to the number of elements in the set $\mathcal{X}$ . Strictly speaking, a function $f(x)$ defined according to Equation 1 could theoretically contain kernels centered on every element $x' \in \mathcal{X}$ , in which case the dimensionality of $\mathcal{H}$ would be as large as the set itself ( $m=|\mathcal{X}|$ ) and possibly infinite if the set $\mathcal{X}$ is infinitely large (e.g., $\mathcal{X}$ is the continuous real line). Wouldn't specifying $|\mathcal{X}|$ as the upper limit of the sum be more general than $m$ ? If we are only interested in $f(x)$ which are based only on a subset of $\mathcal{X}$ we could still sum over all theoretically possible dimensions and throw out the irrelevant kernels by setting their corresponding entries in $f(\cdot)$ to zero. Is this right or am I missing something?","I am trying to wrap my head around some concepts of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) without having a formal background in functional analysis.

My attempt : For $F(f,x)=f(x),F(g,x)=g(x)$, $\left | F(f,x)-F(g,x) \right |=\left | f(x)-g(x) \right |\leq \sup\left | f(x)-g(x) \right |=d(f,g)$ Hence, $F$ is continuous on $C(K)\times K $. If I show $B$ is closed and pointwise bounded ,then $B$ is equicontinuous by Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Since $B$ and $K$are compact, cartesian product $B\times K$ is also a compact set. So, $F$ is uniformly continuous on $B\times K$ . $B$ is compact. By Heine-Borel theorem, $B$ is closed and bounded. It suffices to show that $B$ is pointwise bounded. But, I don't know this part using the uniform continuity of F on $B\times K$.",,"['real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis', 'equicontinuity', 'arzela-ascoli']"

64,Locally convex subspace,Locally convex subspace,,"While studying functional analysis the following question came up. Let $(E, P)$ be a locally convex space where $P$ is a family of seminorms. Also, let $F \subseteq E$ be a linear subspace endowed with the family of seminorms $P_F := \{p_{\vert F} \; : \; p \in P\}$. Show that a subset $V \subseteq F$ is open with regard to $P_F$ if and only if $V = U \cap F$ where $U \subseteq E$ and $U$ is open with regard to $P$. What I tried so far is the following. First, since $F$ is a linear subspace we know that $0 \in F$ and $E$ is locally convex, the intersection of convex sets is convex which makes $(F, P_F)$ a locally convex space as well, i.e. there is a balanced absorbing convex local base at zero. Also, $V$ being open with regard to the family of seminorms in the space $(F,P_F)$ is to say that $$\forall x \in V, \ \exists \ \epsilon_x > 0, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x \in P_F \ : V(x, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x, \epsilon_x) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n_x} \{y \in F : p_i^x(x - y) < \epsilon\} \subseteq V$$ For the ""$\Rightarrow$"" direction I now have to somehow show that, based on this notion of $V$ being open, we can infer that there has to be another set $U \subseteq E$ which is open to the entire seminorm family and for which it holds that $V = U \cap F$.

But this seems heuristic at best, how would one use the notions of local convexity and openess regarding a seminorm system correctly to write it down?","While studying functional analysis the following question came up. Let $(E, P)$ be a locally convex space where $P$ is a family of seminorms. Also, let $F \subseteq E$ be a linear subspace endowed with the family of seminorms $P_F := \{p_{\vert F} \; : \; p \in P\}$. Show that a subset $V \subseteq F$ is open with regard to $P_F$ if and only if $V = U \cap F$ where $U \subseteq E$ and $U$ is open with regard to $P$. What I tried so far is the following. First, since $F$ is a linear subspace we know that $0 \in F$ and $E$ is locally convex, the intersection of convex sets is convex which makes $(F, P_F)$ a locally convex space as well, i.e. there is a balanced absorbing convex local base at zero. Also, $V$ being open with regard to the family of seminorms in the space $(F,P_F)$ is to say that $$\forall x \in V, \ \exists \ \epsilon_x > 0, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x \in P_F \ : V(x, p_1^x, \ldots, p_{n_x}^x, \epsilon_x) = \bigcap_{i=1}^{n_x} \{y \in F : p_i^x(x - y) < \epsilon\} \subseteq V$$ For the ""$\Rightarrow$"" direction I now have to somehow show that, based on this notion of $V$ being open, we can infer that there has to be another set $U \subseteq E$ which is open to the entire seminorm family and for which it holds that $V = U \cap F$. But why is this the case? The other ""$\Leftarrow$"" direction seems to be clearer.

Theorem (1). The map $M_P$ has a linear continuous inverse $M_{P}^{-1}:\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{S}} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$. From this result we can easily deduce the following Theorem (2). Let $T \in \mathcal{S}'$. Then there exists $S \in \mathcal{S}'$ such that $P \cdot S=T$. Proof. The map $T \circ M_{P}^{-1}: \mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{S}} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a linear continuous functional, so by the Hahn-Banach Theorem it can be extened to a continuous linear functional $S$ on $\mathcal{S}$. $S$ satifies $S(P\phi)=T(\phi)$ for each $\phi \in \mathcal{S}$, so $P \cdot S = T$.

If we could do this, then of course we could prove Theorem (3) by using the same argument we used to prove Theorem (2). Any help is welcome. Thank you very much in advance for your attention. NOTE. Let me notice that there is instead a way of proving Theorem (3) by using Theorem (2) (but of course this was not what HÃ¶rmander had in mind). Let $\Gamma$ be the collection of all open rectangles $\omega$, such that the closure of $\omega$ is a compact set contained in $\Omega$. Clearly $\Gamma$ is an open covering of $\Omega$. Let $\omega \in \Gamma$ and choose $\xi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)$ such that $\xi=1$ on $\omega$. Since $\xi \cdot T$ is a distribution with compact support, it defines a tempered distribution, so that by Theorem (2) there exists $V \in \mathcal{S}'$ such that  \begin{equation} V(P \phi)= T(\xi \phi) \quad (\phi \in \mathcal{S}). \end{equation} In particular, we have \begin{equation} V(P\phi)=T(\xi \phi)=T(\phi) \quad (\phi \in \mathcal{D}(\omega)). \end{equation} Let us denote with $S_{\omega}$ the restriction of $V$ to $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$. We have $S_{\omega} \in \mathcal{D}(\omega)$. Moreover, if  $T_{\omega}$ is the restriction of $T$ to $\mathcal{D}(\omega)$, then we have $ H \cdot S_{\omega} = T_{\omega}$. In other terms, the equation $P \cdot S = T$ has a solution on $\omega$. Now, we know that there exists  a locally finite partition of unity $(\psi_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ in $\Omega$ subordinate to the open cover $\Gamma$ (see Rudin, Functional Analysis, Second Edition, Theorem (6.20)). This means that $(\psi_j)_{j=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$, with $\psi_j \geq 0$, such that: (i) each $\psi_j$ has its support in some member of $\Gamma$, (ii) $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \psi_j(x)=1$ for every $x \in \Omega$, (iii) to every compact $K \subset \Omega$ correspond an integer $m$ and an open set $W \supset K$ such that \begin{equation} \psi_1(x)+\dots+\psi_m(x)=1, \end{equation} for all $x \in W$. Let $\omega_j$ be the element of $\Gamma$ which contains the support of $\psi_j$ according to (i). Then define \begin{equation} S(\phi)= \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} S_{\omega_j}(\psi_j \phi) \quad (\phi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)). \end{equation} Since for each $\phi \in \mathcal{D}(\Omega)$ only finitely many of the functions $\psi_j \phi$ are different from zero, it is easy to see that $S$ is well defined, that $S \in \mathcal{D'}(\Omega)$ and that $P \cdot S = T$.

93,On the space $L^0$ and $\lim_{p \to 0} \|f\|_p$,On the space  and,L^0 \lim_{p \to 0} \|f\|_p,"For $0 < p < \infty$, the definitions of the spaces $L^p$ are very natural. Then, we of course want $L^\infty$ and $L^0$ to be some kind of limits of $L^p$ spaces. What does the parameter $p$ tell about a function $f \in L^p$? If $f \in L^p$ for very large $p$, it means that $f$ behaves very well near its singularities. If $f \in L^p$ for very small $p$, it means that $f$ decreases fast at infinity. The limiting case $p \to \infty$ then of course means that $f \in L^\infty$ if $f$ has no singularities in some sense (essentially bounded). Then we define $\|f\|_\infty = \operatorname{ess sup}_{x\in X} |f(x)|$, which is a norm in $L^\infty$. In some cases it even holds that $\|f\|_\infty = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|f\|_p$. How about $p \to 0$? I've never really seen anything said about this space, so I guess it's not very interesting. But I still started to think about it. Now, $f \in L^0$ should mean that $f$ is extremely bounded at infinity, meaning that $f$ is compactly supported. Of course because we are talking about measure and integration theory, the notion of compact support has to be modified accordingly. I guess we want to define that $f \in L^0$ if the support of $f$ is compact modulo sets of measure $0$. Is this how we should think about $L^0$? If it is, then we probably want to define $\|f\|_0 = \mu(\operatorname{spt} f)$, or something like that. So, what is the number $\lim_{p \to 0} \|f\|_p$? For measurable compactly supported bounded functions it is easy to see that  \begin{align} \lim_{p \to 0} \int_X |f|^p = \mu(\operatorname{spt} f)\,. \end{align} But if we want to take the limit of $\|f\|_p$, the integral should be raised to the power $1/p$, which tends to infinity, which complicates things. So my questions are: what should the space $L^0$ be, what should be its ""norm"" $\|f\|_0$ and when is $\|f\|_0$ the limit of $\|f\|_p$? Also, why does the wikipedia page on $L^p$ spaces refer to $L^0$ as the space of measurable functions?
