0,Diameter of $S_{n^2}$ with respect to two copies of $S_{n} \wr S_{n}$,Diameter of  with respect to two copies of,S_{n^2} S_{n} \wr S_{n},"Let $G=S_{n^2}$ the symmetric group on a grid of $n^2$ letters. Now $G$ contains a maximal subgroup $H \cong S_n \wr S_n$ by the O'Nan-Scott theorem, and we can think of elements that look something like $(\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n)\tau$ where $\sigma_i$ acts on the $i$ th row of letters, permuting letters within the row, and $\tau$ permutes the rows themselves. Similarly, there exists another isomorphic copy of this subgroup, call it $H'$ that acts as above but on columns. By maximality, $G=\langle H, H' \rangle$ . So then my question: what is the diameter of the Cayley graph $\Gamma (G,H\cup H')$ ?","Let the symmetric group on a grid of letters.

16,Group theory conjectures,Group theory conjectures,,"After completing the following problem,   ''if $\phi$ is a homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto a group of order $5$, determine $\ker(\phi)$,""  I have made two conjectures I would like some feedback on. If you are very confident in group theory please feel free to skip to the bulleted conjectures at the end. Recall the definition of the kernel of a group homomorphism $\phi$: the kernel of $\phi$ is $ker(\phi)=\{g\in G \text{ : } \phi(g)=e_H\}$ where $e_H$ is the identity in H. So to determine the $ker(\phi)$, we find all elements mapped to $0$ by $\phi$. Consider the fact that there can certainly be more than one group homomorphism $\phi$ that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto a group of order $5$. However, note that a group of prime order, which $5$ is, is cyclic. There exists only one cyclic group of finite order, $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Hence the group homomorphism $\phi$ maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Recall the example in counting homomorphisms done at the end of class. We stated that homomorphisms between cyclic groups are completely determined by where it sends the generators. Note that any $m<n$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ if $(m,n)=1$, i.e. $m,n$ are relatively prime. Hence every element in $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_5$ since $5$ is prime. Recall that if $\phi \text{ : }G\rightarrow H$ is a group homomorphism and $G,H$ are cyclic, then $\phi$ sends a generator of a $G$ to a generator of a group $H$. Since there are only $5$ possible generators for $\mathbb{Z}_5$ we check the $5$ possible homomorphisms. Let the generator of concern for $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ be $1_{30}$. We will be utilizing a subscript with elements to denote where the element lives, $x_{30}$ for $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $x_5$ for $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{5}$. The $5$ possible homomorphisms send, \begin{eqnarray*} \phi_0 \text{ : }   1_{30} &\longmapsto& 0_5 \\  \phi_1 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 1_5 \\  \phi_2  \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 2_5 \\  \phi_3 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 3_5 \\ \phi_4 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 4_5, \end{eqnarray*} where the subscript on the homomorphisms indicates where $\phi(1)$ is sent. Consider the trivial homomorphism $\phi_0$ that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$, $\phi_0 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ For the four remaining homomorphisms, we proceed by trial and error: Consider $\phi_1$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_1 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0 & \dots & 3 & 4 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ We see that $ker(\phi_1)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_1(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_1(a+b)=\phi_1(a)+\phi_1(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Consider $\phi_2$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 3 & 0 \\                                                      \end{array}  \right)$ $\phi_2$ is not a homomorphism since $\phi_2(3+4)=\phi_2(7)=4$, but $\phi_2(3)+\phi_2(4)=3$. However, consider a  different $\phi_2$. Let $\phi_2$ be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 0 & \dots & 4 & 3 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ We see that $ker(\phi_2)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_2(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_2(a+b)=\phi_2(a)+\phi_2(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Note the difference between the two $\phi_2$ homomorphisms. Of the first five numbers, none are mapped to themselves as occurred in the first $\phi_2$. However this may not be the only requirement of the homomorphism. Consider $\phi_2$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & \dots & 3 & 2 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ $\phi_2$ is not a homomorphism since $\phi_2(6+3)=\phi_2(9)=2$, but $\phi_2(6)+\phi_2(3)=5$. Now note the difference between the successful $\phi_2$  and the non successful. The $\phi_2$ that is a homomorphism sends the identity to the identity, the generator to the generator, but also, each element of the codomain $\mathbb{Z}_5$ occurs the same amount of times. This occurs since the results of the homomorphism, ``cycle"" in a sense, through the values of the codomain. Notice that the unsuccessful $\phi_2$ directly above does not do this. It maps the identity to the identity but then the identity never appears again. If we combine this property with the property discovered above, that the first five numbers of the domain need to not be sent to themselves, we begin to see that the kernel of these homomorphisms must always be $\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. The same property comes up with a homomorphism $\phi_3$. We have, $\phi_3 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 0 & \dots & 4 & 2 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ As predicted $ker(\phi_3)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_3(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_3(a+b)=\phi_3(a)+\phi_3(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. The same property comes up with a homomorphism $\phi_4$. We have, $\phi_4 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 0 & \dots & 2 & 3 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ As predicted $ker(\phi_4)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_4(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_4(a+b)=\phi_4(a)+\phi_4(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Hence, barring the the trivial homomorphism $\phi_0$, we see that the kernel of all other homomorphisms is $\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Note that with is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_6$. We know that the kernel of a group is a subgroup, and this checks out Based on the above exploration, we make the following claims: Let $f$ be an onto homomorphism between two finite cyclic groups, $f    \text{ : } \mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_m$, where $m<n$ and $(m,n)\neq 1$. Then we have that $ker(f)=\{0+mx\}$ for some $x\in    \mathbb{Z}$ and $mx<n$. The number of homomorphisms between two finite cyclic groups, $\mathbb{Z}_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_m$, where $m<n$ and $(m,n)\neq    1$, is equal to $(m,n)$.","After completing the following problem,   ''if $\phi$ is a homomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto a group of order $5$, determine $\ker(\phi)$,""  I have made two conjectures I would like some feedback on. If you are very confident in group theory please feel free to skip to the bulleted conjectures at the end. Recall the definition of the kernel of a group homomorphism $\phi$: the kernel of $\phi$ is $ker(\phi)=\{g\in G \text{ : } \phi(g)=e_H\}$ where $e_H$ is the identity in H. So to determine the $ker(\phi)$, we find all elements mapped to $0$ by $\phi$. Consider the fact that there can certainly be more than one group homomorphism $\phi$ that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto a group of order $5$. However, note that a group of prime order, which $5$ is, is cyclic. There exists only one cyclic group of finite order, $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Hence the group homomorphism $\phi$ maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Recall the example in counting homomorphisms done at the end of class. We stated that homomorphisms between cyclic groups are completely determined by where it sends the generators. Note that any $m<n$ is a generator of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ if $(m,n)=1$, i.e. $m,n$ are relatively prime. Hence every element in $\mathbb{Z}_5$ is a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_5$ since $5$ is prime. Recall that if $\phi \text{ : }G\rightarrow H$ is a group homomorphism and $G,H$ are cyclic, then $\phi$ sends a generator of a $G$ to a generator of a group $H$. Since there are only $5$ possible generators for $\mathbb{Z}_5$ we check the $5$ possible homomorphisms. Let the generator of concern for $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ be $1_{30}$. We will be utilizing a subscript with elements to denote where the element lives, $x_{30}$ for $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $x_5$ for $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{5}$. The $5$ possible homomorphisms send, \begin{eqnarray*} \phi_0 \text{ : }   1_{30} &\longmapsto& 0_5 \\  \phi_1 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 1_5 \\  \phi_2  \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 2_5 \\  \phi_3 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 3_5 \\ \phi_4 \text{ : } 1_{30} &\longmapsto& 4_5, \end{eqnarray*} where the subscript on the homomorphisms indicates where $\phi(1)$ is sent. Consider the trivial homomorphism $\phi_0$ that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$, $\phi_0 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ For the four remaining homomorphisms, we proceed by trial and error: Consider $\phi_1$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_1 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 0 & \dots & 3 & 4 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ We see that $ker(\phi_1)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_1(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_1(a+b)=\phi_1(a)+\phi_1(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Consider $\phi_2$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 3 & 0 \\                                                      \end{array}  \right)$ $\phi_2$ is not a homomorphism since $\phi_2(3+4)=\phi_2(7)=4$, but $\phi_2(3)+\phi_2(4)=3$. However, consider a  different $\phi_2$. Let $\phi_2$ be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 0 & \dots & 4 & 3 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ We see that $ker(\phi_2)=\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$. Also this is a homomorphism since:  $\phi_2(e_G)=e_H$ where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ and $H=\mathbb{Z}_5$, and also $\phi_2(a+b)=\phi_2(a)+\phi_2(b)$ for all $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}_{30}$. Note the difference between the two $\phi_2$ homomorphisms. Of the first five numbers, none are mapped to themselves as occurred in the first $\phi_2$. However this may not be the only requirement of the homomorphism. Consider $\phi_2$ to be the group homomorphism that maps $\mathbb{Z}_{30}$ onto $\mathbb{Z}_5$ in the following way: $\phi_2 = \left(                                                      \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc}                                                        0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & \dots & 28 & 29 \\                                                        0 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & \dots & 3 & 2 \\                                                      \end{array}                                                    \right)$ $\phi_2$ is not a homomorphism since $\phi_2(6+3)=\phi_2(9)=2$, but $\phi_2(6)+\phi_2(3)=5$. Now note the difference between the successful $\phi_2$  and the non successful. The $\phi_2$ that is a homomorphism sends the identity to the identity, the generator to the generator, but also, each element of the codomain $\mathbb{Z}_5$ occurs the same amount of times.

The same property comes up with a homomorphism $\phi_4$.

Some of these remarks have also been made by Kent Merryfield in an AoPS thread . The main question is in a blockquote below. Rules : Let $G$ be a fixed finite group. Alice and Bob take turns choosing an element of $G$ with Alice going first. At each turn, a player must choose an unchosen element of $G$ which commutes with all previously chosen elements. A player loses the game when they have no legal moves. For which finite groups $G$ does Alice have a winning strategy? We make the following observations about the game: Lemma : The elements chosen in a game must form a maximal abelian subgroup of $G$ . Proof : Consider the subgroup $H$ generated by the chosen elements. Since the generators mutually commute, the subgroup $H$ is abelian. Furthermore, every element of $H$ must have been chosen (otherwise, the game could have been continued with the unchosen elements of $H$ ). Finally, if $K$ is an abelian subgroup of $G$ with $H \leqslant K$ , then $H = K$ (otherwise, the game could have been continued with elements in $K - H$ ). Thus, $H$ is a maximal abelian subgroup of $G$ . Corollary : If $G$ has odd order, then Alice always wins. If $Z(G)$ has even order, then Bob always wins. In particular, if $G$ is nilpotent, then Alice/Bob win if $G$ has odd/even order. Proof : If $G$ has odd order, then by Lagrange's theorem, every maximal abelian subgroup has odd order. Similarly, if $Z(G)$ has even order, then every maximal abelian subgroup must contain $Z(G)$ and hence have even order. In the nilpotent case, $G$ has even order iff $Z(G)$ has even order. Proposition : Alice has a winning strategy iff there exists $g \in G$ such that the centralizer $C_G(g)$ has odd order. Proof : First, if such an element $g$ exists, then Alice can choose $g$ in the first move. The maximal abelian subgroup $H$ chosen at the end of the game must be a subgroup of $C_G(g)$ and must hence have odd order, meaning that Alice must always win after choosing $g$ . However, if no such $g$ exists, then for any first choice $h \in G$ , Bob can respond to Alice by choosing an element of even order in the group $C_G(h)$ by Cauchy's theorem. Consequently, the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ chosen at the end of the game must have even order by Lagrange's theorem, giving Bob the win.

For all $g \in G$ , the centralizer $C_G(g)$ has even order We have $(1) \Rightarrow (2) \Rightarrow (3)$ . Do either/both of these implications hold the other way? Examples : Here are a few examples for various finite groups $G$ : As mentioned before, if $G$ is nilpotent, then Alice wins iff $G$ has odd order. In particular, if $G$ is a $p$ -group for some prime $p$ , then Alice wins iff $p$ is an odd prime. If $G = D_{2n}$ , then Alice wins iff $n$ is odd. If $n$ is even, then $Z(G)$ has even order, whilst if $n$ is odd, then any non-trivial rotation has a centralizer of odd order. If $G = \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ (this is the original problem from the Putnam), then Alice has a winning strategy iff $q$ is even. Indeed, if $q$ is odd, then $Z(G)$ contains the involution $-I$ , while if $q$ is even, then we can find a transformation $T$ with centralizer of odd order (Give $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ the additional structure of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ and let $T$ be multiplication by a generator of $\mathbb{F}^{\times}_{q^n}$ .

Let $m$ be the largest odd integer which is at most $n$ , then the conjugacy class of an $m$ -cycle has order $(m-1)!$ , so the centralizer has order $m$ , which is odd.

23,Group freely generated by monoid,Group freely generated by monoid,,"There are several ways to define the group freely generated by a monoid, all of which (necessarily) produce isomorphic groups. One way starts with a presentation of the monoid, and simply reinterprets this as a presentation of the group. Another way is to formally adjoin the inverse of every element of the monoid. Yet another approach is to do something akin to the construction of the field of fractions of a ring, by considering equivalence classes of pairs of elements in the monoid. (Actually what I had in mind for that last one only works in the commutative case.) As far as I can tell, all of these approaches involve making drastic changes to the underlying sets, and I am wondering whether there is a way of doing this that literally extends the underlying set. More formally, I ask the following: Question. Given a set $S$ together with a multiplication $m$ and an identity $e$ satisfying the monoid axioms, how do we explicitly construct (in terms of $S,m,e$ ) a set $T$ , a multiplication $m'$ , and an inverse $i$ such that: $S\subseteq T$ $m'|_{S\times S}=m$ $(T,m',i,e)$ is a group For example, any such construction would presumably embed the additive monoid $\mathbb N$ in $\mathbb Z$ , whereas the multiplicative monoid $\mathbb N^{\times}$ would presumably be embedded in $\mathbb Q^+$ . It will be a nice bonus if this construction is functorial (i.e., there is a way of extending the definition such that it associates to each monoid homomorphism a group homomorphism between the constructed groups). This question is motivated by some variations in which I do know of such a construction: namely, the construction of free monoids on a set and free groups on a set. The former case, which I will shortly describe, is quite simple and elegant while the latter case is more ugly and complicated. So I was wondering if there was a nicer way to ""factorize"" the construction of a free group into two pieces, each nicer on their own than the composite: first build the free monoid on the set, then build the free group on the constructed monoid. The free monoid construction. Given a set $S$ , let $$ S^\star=\bigsqcup_{n=0}^{\infty}S^n. $$ Turn $S^\star$ into a monoid by defining a multiplication $m\colon S^n\times S^m\to S^{n+m}$ in the obvious way (i.e. concatenation of tuples). The identity is the unique element of $S^0$ . This construction is functorial in an obvious way. The free group construction. I won't spell out the details since they are ugly. Given the generating set $S$ , one considers a subset of $$ \bigsqcup_{n=0}^{\infty}(S\sqcup S)^n $$ consisting of ""reduced words"" (where the second copy of $S$ is thought of as formal inverses to the first copy of $S$ ) and the multiplication consists of concatenation followed by reduction. This is also functorial, but requires some work to show this explicitly. One more comment: a (functorial) answer to my question will yield (after composing with the forgetful functor from groups to monoids) an interesting monad in the category of monoids, whose Eilenberg-Moore category is equivalent to the category of groups.

How ugly! Surely there's a way to manipulate either this answer to the linked question (in the Motivation section) . . . Fix $u,v\in\Bbb Z$ with $un+vm=d$ (Bezout). The map $$\Bbb Z_{\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)}\times\Bbb Z_{\gcd(n,m)} \to\Bbb Z_m\times\Bbb Z_n$$ $$ (a+\operatorname{lcm}(n,m)\Bbb Z,b+\gcd(n,m)\Bbb Z)\mapsto(ua+\tfrac mdb+m\Bbb Z,va-\tfrac ndb+n\Bbb Z)$$ is well-defined(!) and clearly a group homomorphism. For the element on the left to be in the kernel, $ua+\tfrac mdb$ must be a multiple of $m$ and $va-\tfrac ndb$ a multiple of $n$ .

Since $|\mathcal K|$ is the index of the centralizer $C_G(k)$ of any $k\in\mathcal K$, and $|G:C_G(k)| = |N|-1$ divides $|G|$, we must have that G is divisible by the product $|N|(|N|-1)$ of two consecutive numbers.

So when is a normal subgroup comprised of exactly two conjugacy classes? $N = \{1\} \cup \mathcal K$ Here is what I see so far: Unless $|N|=2$ and $N \leq Z(G)$, the subgroup must have trivial intersection with the center, since each element in the center is contained in its own conjugacy class. Since $|\mathcal K|$ is the index of the centralizer $C_G(k)$ of any $k\in\mathcal K$, and $|G:C_G(k)| = |N|-1$ divides $|G|$, we must have that G is divisible by the product $|N|(|N|-1)$ of two consecutive numbers. This also implies $|G|$ is even. Any inner automorphism fixes $N$, but I don't know about outer automorphisms, so $N$ may not have to be a characteristic subgroup. What is the full characterization of these types of normal subgroups? Do they have any important properties? Edit: Ted is correct.",,['group-theory']

84,A few proofs of properties of a certain mapping on groups,A few proofs of properties of a certain mapping on groups,,"This is my first time using Stack Exchange, but it looks like a good resource. I am here to ask a couple questions about my homework. We're working from the latest edition of Abstract Algebra by Herstein. This is problem #3 from p. 73 of that book, and it reads as follows: Let $G$ be any group and $A(G)$ the set of all 1-1 mappings of $G$, as a set, onto itself. Define $L_{a} \colon G \to G$ by $L_{a}(x)=xa^{-1}$. Prove that: (a) $L_{a} = A(G)$. (b) $L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab}$. (c) The mapping $\psi:G \rightarrow A(G)$ defined by $\psi(a) = L_{a}$ is a monomorphism of G into A(G). I believe that I have answered parts b & c correctly, but have some concerns about the rigorousness of my approaches to all three problems. I will start out here by including my proposed solution to part a. Any advice or comments would be greatly appreciated. (a) $A(G)$, as the set of all 1-1 mappings of $G$ onto itself, can be represented as the set of all operations on an element $x \in G$ such that the result is also in $G$. Since $G$ is a group, we know that this set can be represented as the set of all group multiplications $yx \mid x \in G, y \in G$ for a given element $x$. This is because any $x$ element can be fixed as the first parameter, while the $y$ elements are taken over every element of G. We have then that $yx \in G$, due to G's closure under group multiplication. Furthermore, any element $e \in G$ has an inverse element $e^{-1} \in G$, since $G$ is a group. This means that we can consider any element in $G$ as the inverse of its inverse: $e = (e^{-1})^{-1}$. This, when plugged in for our variable $x \in G$ above, gives us that $\forall x \in G, \forall y \in G, yx^{-1} \in G$. This is exactly our given mapping $L_{a}$ above, with the labels rearranged. This shows that $L_{a}$ is a mapping from $G \rightarrow G$, as required. In order to show why this set contains every such possible mapping, we will assume that there is a mapping $M_{a}(x) : G \rightarrow G$ such that $M_{a}(x) \notin L_{a}$. This mapping, as a mapping from G to G, must take the form of a group multiplication: $M_{a}(x) = x*a, x\in G$. However, since G is a group, we have again that $a = (a^{-1})^{-1}$, or, if we let $m = a^{-1}$, that $a = m^{-1}$, and so our mapping can be rewritten as $M_{a}(x) = x*m^{-1} m \in G$. However, this is exactly the same mapping as our above $L_{a}(x)$, showing that every mapping in $A(G)$ can indeed be written as a multiplication between some element $x \in G$ and another element's inverse $a^{-1} \in G$, and thus that $L_{a} \in A(G)$. $\blacksquare$ Thanks for taking the time to check this out, even if you don't feel you can offer any help. EDIT : Thanks to those who pointed out that I had used =, not $\in$, above by mistake. Also appreciated is the edit to italicize my variables. Now I know how to as well. :) EDIT : The responses so far have been so helpful, I'd like to put the other two parts of my solution up to solicit feedback on them as well. Hopefully they aren't as muddled as the first part's was. changed a bit in response to feedback (b)         $L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$ $L_{b}(x) = xb^{-1}$ $(L_{a}L_{b})(x) = L_{a}(L_{b}(x))$ $L_{a}(L_{b}(x)) = L_{a}(xb^-1)$ $L_{a}(xb^-1) = xb^{-1}a^{-1}$ $xb^{-1}a^{-1} = x(ab)^{-1} = L_{ab}(x)$ $L_{a}(x)L_{b}(x) = L_{ab}(x) \quad\blacksquare$ (c) $\psi(a) = L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$. To show that this mapping is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$, we will first rely on part (a) to state that $\psi(a) = L_{a}$ is indeed a mapping from $G$ to $A(G)$. Now we must show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. First we will show that $\psi$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. To this end, we will appeal to the results of our calculations in part (b) to state that $L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab}$, which of course implies that $\psi(a)\psi(b) = L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab} = \psi(ab)$, which proves that $\psi$ is a homomorphism. In order to continue and show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism, we must show that it is an injective (1-1) mapping. Let $\psi(a) = Z = \psi(b)$. This can be written as:         $\psi(a) = L_{a}(e) = ea^{-1} = Z$ $\psi(b) = L_{b}(e) = eb^{-1} = Z$ $Z = ea^{-1} = eb^{-1}$ $a^{-1} = b^{-1} \Rightarrow a = b$ The last line of the above follows from the uniqueness of inverse elements in $G$. This shows that the only way for two output values of $\psi$ to be equal is for their inputs to be equal as well, and thus $\psi$ is an injective homomorphism, or a monomorphism from $G$ to $A(G)$. $\blacksquare$","This is my first time using Stack Exchange, but it looks like a good resource.

This means that we can consider any element in $G$ as the inverse of its inverse: $e = (e^{-1})^{-1}$. This, when plugged in for our variable $x \in G$ above, gives us that $\forall x \in G, \forall y \in G, yx^{-1} \in G$. This is exactly our given mapping $L_{a}$ above, with the labels rearranged. This shows that $L_{a}$ is a mapping from $G \rightarrow G$, as required. In order to show why this set contains every such possible mapping, we will assume that there is a mapping $M_{a}(x) : G \rightarrow G$ such that $M_{a}(x) \notin L_{a}$. This mapping, as a mapping from G to G, must take the form of a group multiplication: $M_{a}(x) = x*a, x\in G$. However, since G is a group, we have again that $a = (a^{-1})^{-1}$, or, if we let $m = a^{-1}$, that $a = m^{-1}$, and so our mapping can be rewritten as $M_{a}(x) = x*m^{-1} m \in G$. However, this is exactly the same mapping as our above $L_{a}(x)$, showing that every mapping in $A(G)$ can indeed be written as a multiplication between some element $x \in G$ and another element's inverse $a^{-1} \in G$, and thus that $L_{a} \in A(G)$. $\blacksquare$ Thanks for taking the time to check this out, even if you don't feel you can offer any help. EDIT : Thanks to those who pointed out that I had used =, not $\in$, above by mistake. Also appreciated is the edit to italicize my variables. Now I know how to as well. :) EDIT : The responses so far have been so helpful, I'd like to put the other two parts of my solution up to solicit feedback on them as well. Hopefully they aren't as muddled as the first part's was. changed a bit in response to feedback (b)         $L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$ $L_{b}(x) = xb^{-1}$ $(L_{a}L_{b})(x) = L_{a}(L_{b}(x))$ $L_{a}(L_{b}(x)) = L_{a}(xb^-1)$ $L_{a}(xb^-1) = xb^{-1}a^{-1}$ $xb^{-1}a^{-1} = x(ab)^{-1} = L_{ab}(x)$ $L_{a}(x)L_{b}(x) = L_{ab}(x) \quad\blacksquare$ (c) $\psi(a) = L_{a}(x) = xa^{-1}$. To show that this mapping is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$, we will first rely on part (a) to state that $\psi(a) = L_{a}$ is indeed a mapping from $G$ to $A(G)$. Now we must show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. First we will show that $\psi$ is a homomorphism of $G$ into $A(G)$. To this end, we will appeal to the results of our calculations in part (b) to state that $L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab}$, which of course implies that $\psi(a)\psi(b) = L_{a}L_{b} = L_{ab} = \psi(ab)$, which proves that $\psi$ is a homomorphism. In order to continue and show that $\psi$ is a monomorphism, we must show that it is an injective (1-1) mapping. Let $\psi(a) = Z = \psi(b)$. This can be written as:         $\psi(a) = L_{a}(e) = ea^{-1} = Z$ $\psi(b) = L_{b}(e) = eb^{-1} = Z$ $Z = ea^{-1} = eb^{-1}$ $a^{-1} = b^{-1} \Rightarrow a = b$ The last line of the above follows from the uniqueness of inverse elements in $G$. This shows that the only way for two output values of $\psi$ to be equal is for their inputs to be equal as well, and thus $\psi$ is an injective homomorphism, or a monomorphism from $G$ to $A(G)$. $\blacksquare$",,['group-theory']

I gave the class the task of enumerating as many subgroups as they could find in $S_4$ and in the group $O$ of rotations of the cube. The students became suspicious that the groups were isomorphic, and came up with the idea of considering the rotations' actions on the cube's long diagonals to get a map $f:O\rightarrow S_4$, which they (rightly) suspected was an isomorphism. The conversation stalled out when they tried to prove that it was an isomorphism. I directed them first to the question of whether $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$, figuring that this would make it easier to deduce injectivity or surjectivity, e.g. by finding generators in the image. However, they were already stuck on whether $f(xy)=f(x)f(y)$, although when they actually calculated $f(xy)$ and $f(x)f(y)$ for two or three pairs of rotations $x,y$ (which involved some intense visualizing work to compose the rotations in 3-space, since they do not know about matrices), the answers did match. As I listened to them talk about it, I realized that there were some subtleties here having to do with the way we labeled the group elements that made me realize there was something fundamental I wanted to understand better here too. I want to get to the bottom of this. Here's the setup: We were looking at rotations of the cube in terms of a fixed coordinate system; you could see them as alibi transformations . Thus, for example, although we didn't do this, you could see the cube as the one with vertices $\{\pm 1,\pm 1,\pm 1\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and $O$ as the group generated by matrices $$x=\begin{pmatrix} & &1\\1& & \\ &1& \end{pmatrix},\; y=\begin{pmatrix}1& & \\ & &-1\\ &1& \end{pmatrix}$$ The point is that we imagine that the coordinate system is fixed, the group elements are fixed alibi transformations in the coordinate system, and the cube is being moved around. Meanwhile, we were writing down the permutations as functions from the index set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ to itself, and composing them accordingly, using the right-to-left convention of function composition. $(123)$ applied to $1$ equals $2$, etc. The map $f$ was given by choosing some labeling on the long diagonals of the cube in its initial position, for example $\overline{(-1,-1,-1)(1,1,1)} = 1$, $\overline{(1,-1,1)(-1,1,-1)} = 2$, $\overline{(1,-1,-1)(-1,1,1)} = 3$, and $\overline{(1,1,-1)(-1,-1,1)} = 4$. Then for a given rotation $\rho$, defining $f(\rho)$ as the permutation that describes where $\rho$ sends each index when the cube is in its original position. To illustrate, in the present example, this means $y\mapsto (1234)$, for example, and $x\mapsto (243)$. We have $$xy = \begin{pmatrix} & &1\\1& & \\ &1& \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1& & \\ & &-1\\ &1& \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} &1& \\1& & \\ & &-1\end{pmatrix}$$ and $f(xy) = (14)$. Meanwhile, $f(x)f(y) = (243)(1234) = (14)$ (remember that we are composing permutations right to left). Thinking about both the permutations and the rotations as functions, in the former case on the set of indices and in the latter case on the cube, and the action can be restricted to the long diagonals, it is clear ( obvious ) to me why $f$ is a homomorphism. All $f$ does is it records what a rotation $\rho$ does to the diagonals. So $f(\rho\eta)$ is what $\eta$, followed by $\rho$, does to the diagonals, and $f(\rho)f(\eta)$ is what $\eta$ does to the diagonals followed by what $\rho$ does to the diagonals.  These are obviously the same. But there is another way of thinking about it that I can engage in that confuses me about this, and I can't quite sort through where the problem is.

(B) Can you explain in terms that engage with this train of thought why $f$ is a homomorphism? As above, think of the group $O$ as acting on the cube by rotations in a fixed coordinate system. $\rho\in O$ refers to a rotation with reference to the fixed coordinate system; changes in orientation of the cube do not affect the meaning of $\rho$. Choose an initial orientation of the cube, and a labeling of the long diagonals, as above. For each $\rho\in O$, write down the permutation $f(\rho)$ that describes the action of $\rho$ on the long diagonals in this initial orientation. Now consider $f(\rho\eta)$. $\eta$ moves the diagonals somewhere, $\rho$ moves them again, and $f$ writes down what the composition did, in terms of the original orientation of the cube. On the other hand, consider $f(\rho)f(\eta)$. $f(\eta)$ is unproblematic; it writes down what $\eta$ did to the diagonals, which is the same as before. But now the diagonals are in new spots, so when $\rho$ acts on them, it will not do the same thing it did when it acted on the cube in its original orientation.
