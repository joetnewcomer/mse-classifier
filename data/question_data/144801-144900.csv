4,Limit of $\sin(x)$ as $x$ approaches zero from the left,Limit of  as  approaches zero from the left,\sin(x) x,"I'm trying to find a proof that: $$ \lim_{x\to0^-}\sin(x)=0$$ I'd like to be able to do the proof without reference to advanced theorems (mean value theorem, series, etc). I have a geometric approach for finding the limit from the right, but I need similar help when approaching zero from the left. Thanks. Update : I am about to prove that the sine is continuous at any value $a$, but I first need to prove that  $$\lim_{\theta\to0}\sin\theta=0\quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{\theta\to0}\cos\theta=1.$$  I've already shown that $f$ is continuous at $a$ if  $$\lim_{h\to 0}f(a+h)=f(a),$$  so then I can show  $$\lim_{h\to0}\sin(a+h)=\sin(a),$$  which implies that the sine is continuous at any $a$. But to do that last step, I need  $$\lim_{\theta\to0}\sin\theta=0 \quad\text{and}\quad \lim_{\theta\to0}\cos\theta=1.$$  Thus, I need to prove each of these without using continuity. I've shown that $\lim_{\theta\to0^+}\sin\theta=0$ using the following image: The area of the triangle is $\frac12r^2\sin\theta$ and the area of the sector is $\frac12r^2\theta$, so, $$0\le\frac12r^2\sin\theta\le\frac12r^2\theta,$$ which simplifies to: $$0\le \sin\theta\le \theta$$ By the squeeze theorem, this makes $\lim_{\theta\to0+}\sin\theta=0$. Now I need a proof that $\lim_{\theta\to0^-}\sin\theta=0$. Update: Due to all the nice help I received, it turns out that if $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$, then $$\sin\theta\le\theta$$ which, which because $\sin\theta$ and $\theta$ are both positive on $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$, is equivalent to $$|\,\sin\theta\,|<|\,\theta\,|.$$ Secondly, if $-\pi/2\le\theta\le0$, then $0\le-\theta\le\pi/2$. Hence, we can substitute $-\theta$ in the last inequality, which leads to: $$\begin{align*} |\sin(-\theta)\,|&\le|-\theta\,|\\ |-\sin(\theta)\,|&\le|-\theta\,|\\ |\sin(\theta)\,|&\le|\,\theta\,| \end{align*}$$ Therefore, if $-\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi/2$, then $$|\sin(\theta)\,|\le|\,\theta\,|.$$ The last step is due to the fact that $|-x|=|x|$ for all real numbers $x$. This last inequality is equivalent to $$-|\,\theta\,|\le\sin\theta\le|\,\theta\,|,$$ and by the squeeze theorem, since both ends go to zero as $\theta\to0$, I've shown that $$\lim_{\theta->0}\sin\theta=0.$$","I'm trying to find a proof that: $$ \lim_{x\to0^-}\sin(x)=0$$ I'd like to be able to do the proof without reference to advanced theorems (mean value theorem, series, etc).

What about limits of sequences in metric spaces, can this happen there too ?","I was reading about limits of sequences recently, and I came across this fact that, ""there are situations in which sequences which may converge to more than one point. Is that really possible ? Till now every real analysis book that i have referred to, has always stated that the limit of every sequence is unique. I am just curious, if this is true then, doesn't this contradict the idea of uniqueness of limits of a sequence ? What about limits of sequences in metric spaces, can this happen there too ?",,"['real-analysis', 'limits', 'metric-spaces']"
