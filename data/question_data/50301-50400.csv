(2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . Compute $\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{1+x^3}$ by integrating $\dfrac{1}{1+z^3}$ over the contour $\gamma$ (defined below) and letting $R\rightarrow \infty$ . The contour is $\gamma=\gamma_1+\gamma_2+\gamma_3$ where $\gamma_1(t)=t$ for $0\leq t \leq R$ , $\gamma_2(t)=Re^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}t}$ for $0\leq t \leq 1$ , and $\gamma_3(t)=(1-t)Re^{i\frac{2\pi}{3}}$ for $0\leq t \leq 1$ . So, the contour is a wedge, and by letting $R\rightarrow \infty$ we're integrating over one third of the complex plane.  I believe this means we are integrating over the entire complex plane under the substitution $u=x^3$ .  There are poles at $-\zeta$ for each third root of unity $\zeta$ , so there's only one pole in this wedge.  I'll just refer to that pole as $-\zeta$ .

I am guessing that this will just be $$\langle f, g \rangle = \int_M fgdV \tag{1}$$ Why do we not have to take the complex conjugate as in Euclidean space? But if this definition is correct, consider the heat equation: $$\partial_t u - \Delta u = 0$$ so that $u: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . In these set of notes they state $$\langle \Delta u, u\rangle_{L^2} = \int_M (\Delta u)u d\mu = -\int_M |\nabla u|^2 d\mu \leq 0 \tag{2}$$ where they take $d\mu$ to be the Riemannian measure. Using (1), (2) is obtained from integrating by parts as one usually does on Euclidean space with $\mu$ the Lebesgue measure. Does this just mean we can always treat $dV$ (or $d\mu$ in the notation of the notes) to be some multiple of the Lebesgue measure? If so, what justifies this? If not, what justifies the integration by parts formula as in (2)? Lastly, I have seen the integration by parts formula on a Riemannian manifold (for example, here ) given as $$\int_M \langle \nabla f, X \rangle = -\int_M f div X + \int_{\partial M} f \langle X, \nu \rangle.$$ But what is the relationship between this formula and the integration by parts of scalar functions as in (2)?","For two vector fields and on a Riemannian manifold with metric , we define I have been unable to find a similar expression for two functions .

(If the Lambert W function is involved, then maybe one term is sufficient.) Here are some ideas. (1) On the LHS (left-hand side), letting $n \to \infty,$ the $y^n$ terms integrand go to zero and you are left with $-1/(1-y),$ and the integral over it will diverge.  However, plotting the integrand for large $n$ , it is seen that the integrand follows the $-1/(1-y)$ curve until it sharply drops to zero near $y=1.$ It is probable that the position of the drop, $y_d,$ is analytically tractable, and one can approximate the integral as $-\int_{0}^{y_d}dy/(1-y).$ However, I have no idea on how to approach a subdominant term. (2) The RHS looks sort of like a Riemann sum, except for the pesky alternating sign, and the fact that odd integers appear in the arguments instead of every integer.  A long time ago I read that the Euler-Maclaurin formula has been extended to character sums, which this looks like.  I also know that Euler-Maclaurin can be used for asymptotic analysis.

73,Closed form for the skew-harmonic sum $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n \overline{H}_n}{n^2}$,Closed form for the skew-harmonic sum,\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n \overline{H}_n}{n^2},"In a post found here it is mentioned that a closed form for the so-called younger brother (younger in the sense the power in the denominator is only squared, rather than cubed as in the linked question) skew-harmonic sum $$S = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n \overline{H}_n}{n^2}$$ can be found, though none is given. Here $H_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k}$ is the $n$ th harmonic number while $\overline{H}_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{(-1)^{k + 1}}{k}$ is the $n$ th skew-harmonic number . I seek the closed-form expression for the sum $S$ . My thoughts on a possible alternative approach to that suggested in the link is as follows. Since $$\ln 2 - \overline{H}_n = (-1)^n \int_0^1 \frac{x^n}{1 + x} \, dx,$$ then $$H_n \overline{H}_n = \ln 2 H_n -(-1)^n H_n \int_0^1 \frac{x^n}{1 + x} \, dx.$$ Thus \begin{align} S &= \ln 2 \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n^2} - \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1 + x} \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n H_n x^n}{n^2} \, dx\\ &= 2 \ln 2 \zeta (3) - \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1 + x} \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n (-x)^n}{n^2} \, dx, \end{align} since $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n^2} = 2 \zeta (3)$ . I then thought of perhaps using the following known generating function of $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{H_n}{n^2} x^n = \operatorname{Li}_3 (x) - \operatorname{Li}_3 (1-x) + \ln (1 - x) \operatorname{Li}_2 (1 - x) + \frac{1}{2} \ln x \ln^2 (1 - x) + \zeta (3),$$ but this leads to complex valued logs and polylogs which I would rather avoid. Continuing Continuing on using the generating function, we see that \begin{align} S &= 2 \ln 2 \zeta (3) - \int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_3 (-x)}{1 + x} \, dx + \int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_3 (1 + x)}{1 + x} \, dx\\ & \qquad - \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (1 + x) \operatorname{Li}_2 (1 + x)}{1 + x} \, dx - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \frac{\ln (-x) \ln^2 (1 + x)}{1 + x} \, dx - \zeta (3) \int_0^1 \frac{dx}{1 + x}. \end{align} Surprisingly, indefinite integrals for all integrals appearing above can be readily found.

Prove that: $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{x} \int_{0}^{x}{f(t) dt}=a.$$ Indication: The condition $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)=a$ implies that $f(t)$ is close to $a$ for some $ t\geq N$ for some N.

Here is what I did: Let $x= M+N$ , where $N$ is a constant. So the limit becomes $$\lim_{M \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{N+M} \int_{0}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt $$ The integral can be split as follows: $$\int_{0}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt=\int_{0}^{N}f(t)~ dt +\int_{N}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt  $$ We can go back to the limit: $$\lim_{M \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{N+M} \left[ \int_{0}^{N}f(t)~ dt +\int_{N}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt  \right] $$ As N is a constant, the integral $ \int_{0}^{N}f(t)~ dt$ is also a constant. Then: $$\lim_{M \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{N+M} \int_{0}^{N}f(t)~ dt = 0 $$ So our main limit is now: $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{x} \int_{0}^{x}{f(t) dt}=\lim_{M \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{N+M} \int_{N}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt$$ Then, it follows form the indications that: $$\lim_{x \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{x} \int_{0}^{x}{f(t) dt}=\lim_{M \to \infty} \dfrac{1}{N+M} \int_{N}^{N+M}f(t)~ dt = a$$ I would like to know if this is a valid approach.
