So the proof starts like this: We define a morphism $$ \mathcal{O}_X(U) \rightarrow K_{X, \eta} = O_{X, \eta}, \ s \mapsto [(U,s)].$$ This map is injective because if $[(U,s)]=0$ then $s(\eta)=0$ in $K_{X, \eta}$ .

My explanation why $V$ is closed: $U$ is affine so we may assume that $U = \text{Spec}(A)$ for some ring $A$ . Then $\mathcal{O}_X(U) = {\mathcal{O}_X}|_U (U) = A$ . So the element $s$ corresponds to some $a \in A$ . In $V$ we have: $\mathfrak{p} \in V$ then $s(\mathfrak{p}) = \frac{s}{1} \equiv 0 \in A_{\mathfrak{p}} / {\mathfrak{p} A_{\mathfrak{p}}}$ .

For the first topology, I think $\mathbb{Z}_6$ works. I cannot find an example for the second topology. My thinking: the easiest example would be an integral domain with exactly two prime ideals, then the zero ideal would give $\{0,1\}$ as a closed set and the elements of the other ideal would give $\{1\}$ as a closed set. Since a finite integral domain is a field, the example I am looking for is infinite. Then I realized that I don't know too many examples, all the integral domains I know do not work. Questions: Am I on the right track? If I am on the right track, is the example one that is obtainable (even for non-experts?)

Is that what it's saying? If so how? I'm having a hard time figuring out what the points of even would be (with being a field, I'm not seeing a lot of opportunities for prime ideals in the power series...), let alone why it would be Hausdorff, why the ""ends would touch"", etc. that a circle is. Maybe it's not saying it's ""the same as"" but rather shares some properties? Clarification of whether I am understanding the point correctly, or help finding elements of would be appreciated!","O X O \mathbb{C}[[X_1, ..., X_n]] X (2n-1) \mathbb{C}[[T]] T T X X \mathbb{C} C^1 X","['algebraic-geometry', 'power-series', 'schemes']"
99,Fiber of a morphism of spectra,Fiber of a morphism of spectra,,"Let $f:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism, and for a fixed prime ideal $\mathfrak p\subset R$ , let $p:R\to k(\mathfrak p)$ be the canonical  homomorphism, $k(\mathfrak  p)$ being the fraction field  of $R/\mathfrak p$ . Take the following (pushout) square: $\require{AMScd}$ $$\begin{CD} R@>>p> k(\mathfrak p)\\ @VVfV @VjVV\\ S@>i>>S\otimes_R k(\mathfrak p) \end{CD}$$ and consider its image (in $\rm Top$ ) under  the functor $\rm Spec$ (whose action I'll denote by $-^*$ ). So $p^*$ is injective, being its domain a singleton ( $R\neq 0$ ), and also $i^*$ is injective: $i=l\circ q$ , where $q:S\to S\otimes_R R/\mathfrak p$ is surjective, and $l: S\otimes _R R/\mathfrak p\to S\otimes_R  k(\mathfrak p)$ is a localization (respect to the subset of elements of the form $1\otimes \bar r$ , $r\notin \mathfrak p$ ) hence $q^*,l^*$ are injective. Until now, we can say that $i^*$ injects its domain into the fiber of $\mathfrak p\in \operatorname{Spec} R$ ; but I don't understand how to deduce the most important part, i.e. that the image of $i^*$ is the entire fiber (and so the square in $\rm Top$ is a pullback). I apologize for the third question of the same kind in  two days, but this passage (that I found on Clark's Commutative Algebra, 4.3) is where my confusion actually started.
