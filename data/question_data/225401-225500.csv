The following similar question had useful answers Importance of 'smallness' in a category, and functor categories and one of the answers said that to form the category of presheaves on a category $C$ (such as $C=Et(X)$) you need $C$ to be small, since if $C$ is a proper class, then the presheaf category $[C^{op}, Sets]$ is certainly not small and someone suspected it might not even be a class.  But in the development of etale cohomology, are there results where we really need to consider all presheaves on $Et(X)$ at once, and not just some (say a class or set) of presheaves?",,"['algebraic-geometry', 'etale-cohomology']"

However i have more specific questions: By a generic point i will mean a non closed point on n dimensional projective space (so a non maximal prime ideal). Pick a point p in $\mathbb{P}^n$, and consider projection away from p. Question: What happens if p is not a closed point? My guess is that a line L trough p must contain $\overline{p}$, which we for the moment suppose to be a line, hence $L = \overline{p}$? So there is just one line through p?? But then projection from p does not make sense. And if the dimension of $\overline{p}$ is bigger then one, then a line through p has dimension bigger then one? That does not make sense at all. However, Beauville page 42, prop IV.5, talks about ""generic projection"". Question: So does he mean projection away from the generic point, or does he mean generic in the sense of ""almost all points"" here? If my reasoning above is correct, it will of course be the last, but it very well might be flawed. So far for generic. My second and last question concerns degree of varieties.

He lets H be a hyperplane section of S, and then says H.H = deg(S) (intersection product of curves) Question 1: I assumed that by a ""hyperplane section of S"", he means the intersection of S with a hyperplane (assumed to be nonempty). Is this correct? Question 2: Is it true in general that the intersection product of such a hyperplane section with itself gives the degree of a surface?

Question: So does he mean projection away from the generic point, or does he mean generic in the sense of ""almost all points"" here? If my reasoning above is correct, it will of course be the last, but it very well might be flawed. So far for generic. My second and last question concerns degree of varieties. On the same page, p.42, Beauville talks about a surface S in $\mathbb{P}^n$. He lets H be a hyperplane section of S, and then says H.H = deg(S) (intersection product of curves) Question 1: I assumed that by a ""hyperplane section of S"", he means the intersection of S with a hyperplane (assumed to be nonempty). Is this correct? Question 2: Is it true in general that the intersection product of such a hyperplane section with itself gives the degree of a surface? The questions seem really specific, but answers to them will help me in a lot of other places in the book as well! So lots of thanks in advance!!

67,"If $f$ and $g$ are algebraic functions, is $x\mapsto (f(x),g(x))$ contained in an algebraic curve?","If  and  are algebraic functions, is  contained in an algebraic curve?","f g x\mapsto (f(x),g(x))","Let's consider the following definition (I'm not an expert, so let me know if this is not the usual one!). Let $I\subset \mathbb{R}$ be an open interval. A function $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ is said to be algebraic on $I$ if there is a nonzero polynomial $p\in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ such that $p(x,f(x)) = 0$ , for every $x\in I$ . Remark: Even if this is not usual, it is what I have in the situation I'm studying. My question is: Given two algebraic functions $f,g$ on $I$ , is there a nonzero polynomial $P\in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ such that $P(f(x),g(x))=0$ for every $x\in I$ ? What I've tried: Let $p$ and $q$ be polynomials on $\mathbb{R}[x,y]$ such that $p(x,f(x))=q(x,g(x))=0$ , for every $x\in I$ . Write $$p(x,y)=\sum_{j=0}^n a_j(y) x^j,$$ $$ q(x,y)=\sum_{j=0}^m b_j(y) x^j,$$ with $a_j, b_j\in \mathbb{R}[y]$ and $a_n$ , $b_m$ both not identically zero. Whithout loss of generality, suppose $m\leq n$ . Then we have $$b_m(g(x)) x^m =-\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}b_j(g(x)) x^j,\quad \forall x\in I.$$ Then, multiplying the equation $0=p(x,f(x))$ by $b_m(g(x))$ as many times as needed, allows us to decrease the degree of $x$ in this equation to, at most, $m-1$ . More precisely, this yields an equation of the form $$Q(x,f(x),g(x))=0,\quad \forall x\in I,$$ for a certain polynomial $Q\in \mathbb{R}[x,y,z]$ , with degree at most $m-1$ on $x$ . Collecting again on $x$ and isolating its leading term, allows us again to decrease the degree of $x$ by multiplying the equation $q(x,g(x))=0$ by its coefficient (again, as many times as needed - and this complicates matters, since we're talking about powering polynomials). So eventually, we're going to have an equation ""free of $x$ "", i.e. $P(f(x),g(x))=0$ , for some $P\in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ . Example: Consider $n=2$ , $m=n-1$ . For the sake of simplicity, let's write $a_j(f(x))$ and $b_j(g(x))$ just as $a_j$ , $b_j$ . Then we have $$a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=0,$$ $$b_1x=-b_0.$$ Multiplying the first equation by $b_1^2$ , we get the relation $$a_2b_0^2-a_1b_0b_1+a_0b_1^2=0.$$ The case $n=3$ , $m=n-1$ will require two steps and yields a considerably more complicated relation... This seems a very promising algorithm, at least in theory (although computationally expensive). But is there any hope to pose conditions on $f$ and $g$ in order to guarantee that $P$ is nonzero? Actually, what $P\equiv 0$ would mean for $f$ and $g$ ?

86,"Hartshorne AG, proof of proposition 5.7 and 5.8: ""The question is local, so we may assume $X$ is affine ...""","Hartshorne AG, proof of proposition 5.7 and 5.8: ""The question is local, so we may assume  is affine ...""",X,"On several instances, Hartshorne states that certain questions are ""local"". What is the reasoning behind it? Some instances in the text by Hartshorne, algebraic geometry, occur on p. 114 f., proof of proposition 5.7, or proof of proposition 5.8. In section 5 chapter 2, quasi-coherent sheaves are discussed. Quasi-coherent sheaves deal with $\mathcal{O}_X$ -modules, which on some open covers of $X$ are isomorphic to a sheaf associated to a $A_i$ -module for some appropriately chosen ring $A_i$ . The elements of the open covers each equal the spectrum of a ring $A_i$ . Proposition 5.7 deals with a scheme $X$ , which is not necessarily affine, and states that kernels, cokernels and images of morphisms between quasi-coherent sheaves $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$ are quasi-coherent. Hartshorne simply states in the proof that by localness of the question, affineness can be assumed. I interpret it in the way that quasi-coherence requires that the restriction of a sheaf of modules to each element of some open covering is isomorphic to $\widetilde{M_{i}}$ where $M_{i}$ is a module over a ring $A_{i}$ with $\text{Spec}(A_{i})=U_{i}$ . An interpretation of the Hartshorne's explanation is that the property in question can be checked on the stalks. By proposition 1.1., p. 63 a morphism of sheaves on $X$ is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map on the stalks at $P$ is an isomorphism for each element $P$ of the topological space $X$ . Certainly for an affine structure, the stalk of a sheaf of $A_i$ -modules at $\mathfrak{p}$ is isomorphic to the localisation $(\widetilde{M_i})_{\mathfrak{p}}$ , where $M_i\cong \Gamma(\text{Spec}(A_i),\widetilde{M_i})$ (proposition 5.1 (b) and (d)). An alternative interpretation might be that localness refers to the open covers $\{U_i\}_i$ , but I am sightly doubtful about the latter interpretation. In part (a) of  proposition 5.8, the assumption of quasi-coherence of $\mathcal{G}$ is a local property on $X$ and $Y$ . Also the claim regarding $f^{*} \mathcal{G}$ relates to quasi-coherence.

Especially part (c) of proposition 5.8 is unclear to me, but the other occurences of the approach ""the question is local, so affineness can be assumed"", remain unclear to me, as well.","On several instances, Hartshorne states that certain questions are ""local"". What is the reasoning behind it? Some instances in the text by Hartshorne, algebraic geometry, occur on p. 114 f., proof of proposition 5.7, or proof of proposition 5.8. In section 5 chapter 2, quasi-coherent sheaves are discussed. Quasi-coherent sheaves deal with -modules, which on some open covers of are isomorphic to a sheaf associated to a -module for some appropriately chosen ring . The elements of the open covers each equal the spectrum of a ring . Proposition 5.7 deals with a scheme , which is not necessarily affine, and states that kernels, cokernels and images of morphisms between quasi-coherent sheaves and on are quasi-coherent. Hartshorne simply states in the proof that by localness of the question, affineness can be assumed. I interpret it in the way that quasi-coherence requires that the restriction of a sheaf of modules to each element of some open covering is isomorphic to where is a module over a ring with . An interpretation of the Hartshorne's explanation is that the property in question can be checked on the stalks. By proposition 1.1., p. 63 a morphism of sheaves on is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map on the stalks at is an isomorphism for each element of the topological space . Certainly for an affine structure, the stalk of a sheaf of -modules at is isomorphic to the localisation , where (proposition 5.1 (b) and (d)). An alternative interpretation might be that localness refers to the open covers , but I am sightly doubtful about the latter interpretation.

Let me explain the crux of each part that I understand so far. For II.9.6,  the main point of the application is that $\operatorname{Pic}(\widehat{X})\cong \varprojlim_n \operatorname{Pic}(\widehat{X})(X_n)$ where $X_n$ is the scheme $(\widehat{X},\mathcal{O}_{\widehat{X}}/\mathfrak{I}^n)$ where $\mathfrak{I}$ is the ideal of definition to this formal scheme.

The only thing one needs to check is that the inverse system of global sections groups is Mittag-Leffler and this should easy enough due to a Noetherian hypothesis. The next part is to study the maps $\operatorname{Pic}(X_{n+1})\rightarrow \operatorname{Pic}(X_n)$ . These induced maps clearly exist and these Picard groups can be identified with $H^1$ of their unit sheaves.

Indeed, it is clearly a flag variety, but its Cox ring is not a polynomial ring, so it cannot be toric (see Corollary 2.10 in ""Mori dream spaces and GIT"" by Hu and Keel; and see Example 4.1 in ""The Cox ring of a spherical embedding"" by Gagliardi for the Cox ring calculation). I'm not sure if there is a ""nice"" general answer to my question. Any help is appreciated.",X k X T T\hookrightarrow X T X X X\cong G/P G P\subseteq G X X X=\mathbb{P}^n SL_n/P_n P_n SL_n \mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1 G/G SL_3/B B,"['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups', 'projective-varieties', 'toric-varieties']"
