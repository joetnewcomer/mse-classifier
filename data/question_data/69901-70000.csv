And $S_m$ acts in the obvious way, i.e. if $\sigma(i) = j$, then $\sigma$ sends $s^i$ to $s^j$ and $t^i$ to $t^j$. The homogeneous coordinate ring of $(\mathbb{CP}^1)^m/S_m$ is just the ring of invariants of the $S_m$ action on $\mathcal{S}$. But I still have two questions. Which polynomials are invariant under this action? I still don't see how to conclude that Eric Wofsey's map is a homeomorphism.

The answers below use algebraic topology - I am asking for a proof that does not use algebraic topology, e.g. homology, higher homotopy groups, or the Jordan Curve/Separation Theorem.  No smooth structures, just point-set stuff. Original question: Suppose that $X_n$ is the union of $n$ half closed, straight line segments, all joined at a common point (their boundary point).  So $X_2$ is just an open interval, and otherwise is an $n$ -pointed asterisk with open ends.  How can one show that for $n \geq 2$ all the spaces $X_n \times \mathbb{R}$ are topologically distinct? These spaces are like $n$ sheets attached along a copy of $\mathbb{R}$ . More generally if we take $n$ copies of the $k$ -dimensional closed half-space $\mathbb{H}^k$ and identify them along a $(k-1)$ -plane, how do we show that this space is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^k$ for $n > 2$ ? Discussion: In the more general form, the $n=1$ case is known to be equivalent to the Invariance of Dimension Theorem, but for $n > 2$ it seems more geometrical that the spaces aren't homeomorphic. Be careful trying to use a fact like ""a homeomorphic image of a hyperplane disconnects Euclidean space into two pieces.""  This may be the key ingredient, but would need a point-set proof; I only know of algebraic ones. There is a theorem of Moore, simplified by Bing, that there is no uncountable collection of copies of a simple triod (three arcs attached at a common vertix, i.e. a three-legged asterisk) contained in the plane.  There is a Cantor Set of them along the spine of our three-finned 'plane.'  However, the proofs of this theorem depend crucially on the Jordan Curve Theorem and its corollaries.  It has higher-dimensional analogues, but they also depend on the higher-dimensional form of the Jordan Separation Theorem. Similarly, evaluating the simplicial complex structures could differentiate them, but that is a lot of theory.  If we look at neighborhoods on, say, $X_3 \times \mathbb{R}$ of the points along the 'spine' we will get connected neighborhoods whose boundaries are the theta curve.  It can be shown that no connected set has boundary of a theta curve in $\mathbb{R}^2 = X_2 \times \mathbb{R}$ and this method also generalizes inductively, but again the details are not trivial and we are depending on at least the polygonal version of the Jordan Curve Theorem.  Putting a circle into one of the legit-planes doesn't separate an $n$ -finned plane; similarly (equivalently, as an aside), the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ embeds in it. Yet another method would be counting the number of components that removing the spine creates, which could distinguish $X_2$ from the others but seems harder to generalize.  This is one of the classic separation theorems, that a hyperplane cuts Euclidean space into two components, but we can't assume it. And generalizing any of these methods (except for analyzing as complexes) to higher dimensions seem to have even more difficulties, for example by attaching three copies of threespace to a plane.  There is also the possibility of using symmetry groups and relating those to the bundle structure, but again it would use a lot of theory. What is the point-set way to prove this?  Or is it equivalent to Jordan Curve Theorem, which would be really interesting?","This question came up again in an algebraic topology course, so I'm placing a bounty on it.

No smooth structures, just point-set stuff. Original question: Suppose that is the union of half closed, straight line segments, all joined at a common point (their boundary point).  So is just an open interval, and otherwise is an -pointed asterisk with open ends.  How can one show that for all the spaces are topologically distinct? These spaces are like sheets attached along a copy of . More generally if we take copies of the -dimensional closed half-space and identify them along a -plane, how do we show that this space is not homeomorphic to for ? Discussion: In the more general form, the case is known to be equivalent to the Invariance of Dimension Theorem, but for it seems more geometrical that the spaces aren't homeomorphic. Be careful trying to use a fact like ""a homeomorphic image of a hyperplane disconnects Euclidean space into two pieces.""  This may be the key ingredient, but would need a point-set proof; I only know of algebraic ones. There is a theorem of Moore, simplified by Bing, that there is no uncountable collection of copies of a simple triod (three arcs attached at a common vertix, i.e. a three-legged asterisk) contained in the plane.  There is a Cantor Set of them along the spine of our three-finned 'plane.'  However, the proofs of this theorem depend crucially on the Jordan Curve Theorem and its corollaries.  It has higher-dimensional analogues, but they also depend on the higher-dimensional form of the Jordan Separation Theorem. Similarly, evaluating the simplicial complex structures could differentiate them, but that is a lot of theory.  If we look at neighborhoods on, say, of the points along the 'spine' we will get connected neighborhoods whose boundaries are the theta curve.  It can be shown that no connected set has boundary of a theta curve in and this method also generalizes inductively, but again the details are not trivial and we are depending on at least the polygonal version of the Jordan Curve Theorem.  Putting a circle into one of the legit-planes doesn't separate an -finned plane; similarly (equivalently, as an aside), the complete bipartite graph embeds in it. Yet another method would be counting the number of components that removing the spine creates, which could distinguish from the others but seems harder to generalize.  This is one of the classic separation theorems, that a hyperplane cuts Euclidean space into two components, but we can't assume it. And generalizing any of these methods (except for analyzing as complexes) to higher dimensions seem to have even more difficulties, for example by attaching three copies of threespace to a plane.  There is also the possibility of using symmetry groups and relating those to the bundle structure, but again it would use a lot of theory. What is the point-set way to prove this?  Or is it equivalent to Jordan Curve Theorem, which would be really interesting?","X_n n X_2 n n \geq 2 X_n \times \mathbb{R} n \mathbb{R} n k \mathbb{H}^k (k-1) \mathbb{R}^k n > 2 n=1 n > 2 X_3 \times \mathbb{R} \mathbb{R}^2 = X_2 \times \mathbb{R} n K_{3,3} X_2","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometric-topology', 'continuum-theory']"

88,Is Arens Square a Urysohn space?,Is Arens Square a Urysohn space?,,"Example 80 in Steen-Seebach 1 is called Arens Square.

If we take any neighborhoods $O_a\ni a$ and $O_b\ni b$ then they contain neighborhoods of the form $B(a,\frac1n)\cap S$ , $B(b,\frac1n)\cap S$ for some $n$ . Now let $c$ be any point of the form $(\frac12,r\sqrt2)$ with $y-1/n<\sqrt2r<y+1/n$ . Then every basic neighborhood of $c$ intersects these two balls and, consequently, it intersects $O_a$ and $O_b$ . Which means that $c\in \overline{O_a} \cap \overline{O_b}$ .

Munkres, 2nd edition: Show that $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order topology is metrizable. The dictionary order on the set $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is defined as follows: For any two points $x_1\times y_1$, $x_2 \times y_2$ $\in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, we define $$x_1 \times y_1 \prec x_2 \times y_2$$   if and only if either $x_1 < x_2$, or if $x_1 = x_2$ and $y_1 < y_2$. Now the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is the one having as a basis all sets of the fomm  $$\left( a \times b, a \times c \right) \colon= \left\{ \ x \times y \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \ \colon \ a \times b \prec x \times y \prec a \times c \ \right\},$$  where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $b < c$. Now if we define the funtion $d \colon \left(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \right) \times \left( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \right) \to \mathbb{R}$ as  $$d\left( x_1 \times y_1, x_2 \times y_2 \right) \colon = \begin{cases} 1 \ \mbox{ if } \ x_1 \neq x_2; \\ \min \left(\  \vert y_1 - y_2 \vert, \ 1 \ \right) \ \mbox{ otherwise }, \end{cases} $$ then is this function $d$ a metric? How to verify the triangle inequality? Does this function give the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$? If $x_1 = x_2 = x_3$, then we have  $$ \begin{align} & \ d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_3 \times y_3 \right) \\ &= \min\left( \vert y_1 - y_3 \vert, \ 1 \right) \\ &\leq \min\left( \vert y_1 - y_2 \vert, \ 1 \right)  + \min\left( \vert y_2 - y_3 \vert, \ 1 \right) \\ & \ \ \mbox{ [using the fact that this minimum is the same as the standard bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$]} \\  &= d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_2 \times y_2 \right) + d\left(x_2 \times y_2, x_3 \times y_3 \right). \end{align} $$ If $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $x_2 \neq x_3$, then we have  $$ \begin{align} d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_3 \times y_3 \right) &\leq 1 < 1 + 1 =  d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_2 \times y_2 \right) + d\left(x_2 \times y_2, x_3 \times y_3 \right). \end{align} $$ If $x_1 = x_2$ and $x_2 \neq x_3$, then $x_1 \neq x_3$ either, and so  $$ \begin{align} d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_3 \times y_3 \right) &= 1 \\ &\leq d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_2 \times y_2 \right) + 1 \\ &= d\left(x_1 \times y_1, x_2 \times y_2 \right) + d\left(x_2 \times y_2, x_3 \times y_3 \right). \end{align}$$ And, similarly for the case when $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $x_2 = x_3$. Is this demonstration of the triangle inequality complete and correct? PS: Assuming that the above $d$ is a metric, here is my attempt at showing that the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ is indeed the one induced by the metric $d$ above. Let   $$B \colon= \{ a \} \times (b, c)  = \{ \ a \times t \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \ \colon \ b < t < c \ \} = ( a \times b, a \times c) $$    be a basis element for the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, and let $x \times y \in B$. Then of course $x = a$ and $b < y < c$. Let us put    $$ \epsilon \colon= \min \{ \ y-b, c-y, 1 \}.  $$   Then if $s \times t \in B_d ( x \times y, \epsilon)$, then $s \times t \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$, and    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) < \epsilon. \tag{1}$$   and, as $\epsilon \leq 1$, so    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) < 1, $$   which implies that $s = x$, that is, $s = a$, and also from (0) we can conclude that    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) = \min \{ \  \lvert t-y \rvert, 1 \ \}. $$   Then (1) implies that    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) = \min \{ \  \lvert t-y \rvert, 1 \ \} < \epsilon = \min \{\  y - b, c - y , 1 \ \}. $$   So    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) = \lvert t-y \rvert < \min \{ \ y-a, b-y \} , $$    The last relation implies that $b < t < c$. So $s \times t \in B$. Thus for any basis set $B$ for the dictionary order topology and for any element $x \times y \in B$, we have a basis element $B_d ( x \times y, \epsilon)$ for the $d$-metric topology such that    $$ x \times y \in B_d ( x \times y, \epsilon ) \subset B. $$   So the $d$-metric topology is finer than the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Now let us consider an open ball $B_d( a \times b, \epsilon )$, where $a \times b \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon > 0$ are arbitrary. Let $x \times y \in B_d ( a \times b, \epsilon )$. Then if we choose a real number $\delta$ such that    $$ 0 < \delta < \min \{ \ \epsilon - d( a \times b, x \times y), \ 1 \ \}, $$   then we note that $\delta < 1$ and also that    $$ B_d ( x \times y, \delta ) \subset B_d ( a \times b, \epsilon ). \tag{2} $$ Now let us put    $$ B \colon= \{ \ x \ \} \times ( y-\delta, y + \delta) = \big( \ x \times (y-\delta), \ x \times (y+ \delta) \ \big). $$   Then this $B$ is a basis element for the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \times y \in B$. Moreover, if $s \times t \in B$, then    $s = x$ and $y-\delta < t < y+\delta$ and hence $\lvert t-y \rvert < \delta$. But $\delta < 1$.    So    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) = \min \{ \lvert t-y \rvert, 1 \} = \lvert t-y \rvert < \delta,  $$   which implies that $ s \times t \in B_d( x \times y, \delta )$ and hence also that $s \times t \in B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$ by virtue of (2) above. Therefore $B \subset B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$. Thus we have shown that for any basis element $B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$ for the $d$-metric topology and for any element $x \times y \in B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$, there is a basis element $B$ for the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ such that    $$ x \times y \in B \subset B_d( a \times b, \epsilon). $$   Thus the dictionary order topology is finer than the $d$-metric topology. The preceding few paragraphs show that the $d$- metric topology is the same as the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Is this proof correct? Is each and every step of it correct in its logic and presentation? If not, then where lies the problem?","Here's Prob. 2, Sec. 20 in the book Topology by James R.

Then if we choose a real number $\delta$ such that    $$ 0 < \delta < \min \{ \ \epsilon - d( a \times b, x \times y), \ 1 \ \}, $$   then we note that $\delta < 1$ and also that    $$ B_d ( x \times y, \delta ) \subset B_d ( a \times b, \epsilon ). \tag{2} $$ Now let us put    $$ B \colon= \{ \ x \ \} \times ( y-\delta, y + \delta) = \big( \ x \times (y-\delta), \ x \times (y+ \delta) \ \big). $$   Then this $B$ is a basis element for the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \times y \in B$. Moreover, if $s \times t \in B$, then    $s = x$ and $y-\delta < t < y+\delta$ and hence $\lvert t-y \rvert < \delta$. But $\delta < 1$.    So    $$ d( s \times t, x \times y ) = \min \{ \lvert t-y \rvert, 1 \} = \lvert t-y \rvert < \delta,  $$   which implies that $ s \times t \in B_d( x \times y, \delta )$ and hence also that $s \times t \in B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$ by virtue of (2) above. Therefore $B \subset B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$. Thus we have shown that for any basis element $B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$ for the $d$-metric topology and for any element $x \times y \in B_d( a \times b, \epsilon)$, there is a basis element $B$ for the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ such that    $$ x \times y \in B \subset B_d( a \times b, \epsilon). $$   Thus the dictionary order topology is finer than the $d$-metric topology. The preceding few paragraphs show that the $d$- metric topology is the same as the dictionary order topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Is this proof correct? Is each and every step of it correct in its logic and presentation? If not, then where lies the problem?",,['general-topology']

Suppose $X$ is compact under $\mathcal{T}$. Since $X$ is compact, for every open covering $\mathcal{A}$ of $X$, there exists a finite sub covering of $X$, that is $\cup _{i = 1} ^{n} A_i = X $.
