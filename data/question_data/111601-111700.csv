0,"Verifying $\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$ is a group",Verifying  is a group,"\{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}","I'm trying to verify that the set $S = \{0,1, \ldots, n-1\}$ ( $n > 1$ ) is a group under the operation $$ (a,b) \mapsto \begin{cases} a + b & \text{ if $a + b \leq n-1$} \\  a + b - n & \text{ if $a+b > n - 1$} \end{cases}  $$ I know that this is in effect $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ , but at this point in the lecture notes I'm working through, equivalence classes have not been introduced, so I need to prove that this set under the given operation is a group. Here is my attempt. I'm going to denote addition of two elements of $S$ by $+_n$ to distinguish it from addition in $\mathbb{Z}$ , denoted $+$ . Closure. Given $a,b \in S$ , we either have $a + b \leq n-1$ or $a + b > n-1$ . If $a + b \leq n-1$ , then $a +_{n} b = a + b \in S$ . If $a + b > n-1$ , then $a +_{n} b = a + b - n$ . We need to check that $0 \leq a + b - n \leq n-1$ . If $a + b > n - 1$ , then $a + b - n > (n-1) - n = -1$ . As a sum of integers is another integer, we have $a + b - n \geq 0$ . Furthermore, $a,b \in S$ , so $a,b \leq n - 1$ . Therefore, in $\mathbb{Z}$ , $a + b \leq (n-1) + (n-1) = 2n - 2$ . Therefore $a + b - n \leq (2n - 2) - n = n - 2 \leq n - 1$ . Therefore, $a +_{n} b \in S$ . Identity. I claim that $0$ is the identity element in $S$ . Fix $a \in S$ . Then $0 \leq a \leq n - 1$ , so in $\mathbb{Z}$ , $0 \leq a + 0 \leq n - 1$ , so $a +_{n} 0 = a + 0 = a$ . Similarly, as $a + 0 = 0 + a$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ , we have $0 +_{n} a = a$ . Inverses. Fix $a \in S$ . First, $0 + 0 = 0$ , so $0$ is its own inverse, so we assume $a > 0$ . Then $n - a < n$ , i.e., $n - a \leq n - 1$ . Further, as $a < n$ , $n - a \geq 0$ , so $n - a \in S$ . Consider $a + _{n} (n-a)$ . In $\mathbb{Z}$ , we have $a + (n-a) = 0 \leq n - 1$ , so we have $a +_{n} (n-a) = 0$ . Similarly, $(n-a) +_{n} a = 0$ . The last thing I need to check is associativity. I don't know of a good way to check this other than by cases. If I take $a,b,c \in S$ , I need to show that $$ (a +_{n} b) +_{n} c = a +_{n} (b +_{n} c).  $$ This produces four cases (considered in $\mathbb{Z}$ ) for the left-hand side: \begin{align*} a + b \leq n - 1, \; (a + b) + c \leq n - 1 \\  a + b \leq n - 1, \; (a + b) + c > n - 1 \\  a + b > n - 1, \; (a + b - n) + c \leq n - 1 \\  a + b > n - 1, \; (a + b - n) + c > n   \end{align*} There are similarly four cases for the right-hand side, just swapping $a$ and $b$ with $b$ and $c$ and $c$ with $a$ . Therefore, there are $4 \cdot 4 = 16$ cases in total. I can check all of these manually, but my question is whether this is the way to go. I want to say this result in some way ""follows by associativity in $\mathbb{Z}$ (since when I prove the result with equivalence classes, it does) but the operation is completely different here, so that isn't as clear to me. I'd appreciate if someone could check over my work on closure, identity, and inverses and let me know if I'm on the right track in proving associativity.","I'm trying to verify that the set ( ) is a group under the operation I know that this is in effect , but at this point in the lecture notes I'm working through, equivalence classes have not been introduced, so I need to prove that this set under the given operation is a group.

Thomas. My questions are in bold. I am essentially confused by two steps but I think I understand the entire question apart from that. Let $G$ be a subgroup of order $18$ in the symmetric group $S_6$ given by $$ G = \langle(123), (456), (23)(56)\rangle.$$ Show that $G$ has a normal subgroup of order $9$ and four normal subgroups of order $3$ . By considering quotients show that G has two representations of degree one and four inequivalent irreducible representations of degree $2$ , none of which is injective/faithful. My approach is as follows. Observe $|G|=18=2 \cdot 3^2$ .  Denote $n_3$ for the number of Sylow $3$ -subgroups. We see that by Sylow's theorem $n_3 \equiv 1 \bmod 3$ , so candidates are $n_3=1, 4, 7$ etc. However we also have that $n_3|2$ , so $n_3=1.$ This means there is one sylow subgroup of order $9$ , and another consequence of the Sylow theorems is that this group is then normal. We can construct such a group by considering the two generators of order $3$ : $$ H= \langle(123), (456) \rangle  \cong C_3 \times C_3.$$ Now this group has index $|G:H|= \frac{|G|}{|H|}=18/9=2$ and therefore it must indeed be normal in $G$ . We can also use the generators (and one of its inverses) of order $3$ to construct $4$ cyclic subgroups of order $3$ . $$ N_1=\langle (1 2 3)\rangle=\{e, (123), (132)\} \cong C_3$$ $$ N_2=\langle (4 5 6)\rangle=\{e, (456), (465)\}  \cong C_3$$ $$ N_3=\langle (1 2 3)(4 5 6)\rangle=\{e, (1 2 3)(4 5 6), (1 3 2)(4 6 5)\} \cong C_3$$ $$ N_4=\langle (1 2 3)(4 6 5)\rangle=\{e, (1 2 3)(4 6 5), (1 3 2)(4 5 6 )\}  \cong C_3$$ We have thus found four subgroups of order $3$ , but we still have to prove they are normal in $G$ . (How do I know these exhaust all the subgroups of $G$ one can have of order $3$ ? I do not know how to formulate this/the exact reason). I also thought earlier I knew why these were normal, but I was mistaken. We can now use the fact that we may lift representations of quotients to the original group using the canonical quotient homomorphism. $|G/H|=2$ and it is an abelian group (specifcally $C_2$ ) therefore by a corollary/consequence of Weddderburn's theorem we must have $2$ irreducible complex representations of $G/H$ , which are both $1$ dimensional (I prefer to use Dummit and Foote corollary 11(1), page 861 for this). We lift these to $G$ . Now we can consider the quotients $$G/N_1, G/N_2, G/N_3, G/N_4 $$ According to the hints and solutions section in the back, these each give a $2$ -dimensionial representation, why? Once we accept this we can also lift these $4$ representations to $G$ to end up with $4$ (distinct/inequivalent) representations of $G$ . The dimensions of the representations of $G$ we have so far are thus $1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2$ . Then observe we must also have by theorem $10.(4)$ of page 861 of Dummit and Foote that: $$ \sum_{i=1}^r n_i ^2 = |G|$$ However if we compare this to what we already have, we find: $$ 2 \cdot 1^2 + 4 \cdot 2^2 =18 =|G|$$ So we indeed find that these are all representations by exhaustion.

Given a group hom $\varphi : G \to H$ , we can look at its mono-epi factorization $\varphi = \iota \pi$ : Here $N = \text{Ker }\varphi$ is the obstruction to $\varphi$ 's injectivity, and it is natural to ask if we can extend $H$ by $N$ in a way that is compatible with $\varphi$ .

13,Proving an evenness property for the nth power map for a finite (not necessarily commutative) group $G$,Proving an evenness property for the nth power map for a finite (not necessarily commutative) group,G,"In the course of proving some properties about an algorithm to pick an element of prime order $p$ from a finite group $G$ such that $p ∥ \lvert G \rvert$ ( $p \mid \lvert G \rvert$ but $p^2 \not\mid \lvert G \rvert$ ), I needed the following lemma: Lemma : Let $G$ have order $m$ with prime $p ∥ m$ , and let $f(x) = x^{m/p}$ . If $y$ is a non-identity element in the   image of $f$ , then $\lvert f^{-1}(\{ y \}) \rvert = C$ for some   constant $C$ independent of $y$ . In other words, each   non-identity element in the image of $f$ has an equal number of   elements of $G$ mapping to it. This lemma becomes easy if we can assume that $G$ is commutative, since then $f(x)$ is a group homomorphism, and thus each $y$ in the image is isomorphic to a coset of $\ker f$ . I've managed to prove this myself for arbitrary finite groups, but was wondering if it was correct, and if there's a better way to prove it. Here's my proof (take as given that any non-identity element in the image of $f$ has order $p$ ): Proof :   Let $A_{m/p}$ be the set of elements of $G$ with order a factor   of $m/p$ , and let $k$ be an integer such that $k(m/p) ≡ 1 \pmod p$ . If $y$ is a non-identity element in the   image of $f$ , then we want to show that $$     f^{-1}(\{y\}) = \{ xy^k \mid x ∈ A_{m/p} ∩ C_G(y) \}\text{,}   $$ where $C_G(y)$ is the centralizer of $y$ . Let $xy^k$ be in the set on the right-hand side. $x$ commutes   with $y$ , so it must also commute with $y^k$ , and $(xy^k)^a = x^a y^{ka}$ for any $a$ . Therefore, $$     (xy^k)^{m/p} = x^{m/p} y^{k(m/p)} = y\text{.}   $$ Going the other way, let $z ∈ f^{-1}(\{ y \})$ . Since $y$ has   order $p$ , $z$ had order $pn$ where $n \mid m/p$ . $p$ and $n$ are coprime, so there exists $z_1, z_2 ∈ G$ such that $z = z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1$ , $\operatorname{ord}(z_1) = p$ , and $\operatorname{ord}(z_2) =   n$ . (Let $ap + bn = 1$ . Then $z_1 = z^{bn}$ and $z_2 = z^{ap}$ .) $z_1$ must be in the subgroup generated by $y$ , so $z_1 = y^k$ , and $z_2 ∈ A_{m/p} ∩ C_G(y)$ . Then let $y_1$ and $y_2$ be non-identity elements in the image   of $f$ . If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are in the same cyclic subgroup,   then $y_2 = y_1^a$ for some $a$ , and thus $C_G(y_1) = C_G(y_2)$ .   Therefore, the map $$     g(xy_1^k) = xy_2^k   $$ is a bijection from $f^{-1}(\{ y_1 \})$ to $f^{-1}(\{ y_2 \})$ . Otherwise, if $y_1$ and $y_2$ are not in the same cyclic   subgroup, then they're in different $p$ -Sylow subgroups of $G$ . By the second Sylow theorem, there is some $w$ such that $y_2 = wy_1'w^{-1}$ for some $y_1'$ in the cyclic subgroup   generated by $y_1$ . Then we want to show that the map $g(x) = wxw^{-1}$ is a bijection from $f^{-1}(\{y_1'\})$ to $f^{-1}(\{y_2\})$ . Let $xy_1'^k ∈ f^{-1}(\{y_1'\})$ . Then $$     g(xy_1'^k) = g(x)y_2^k\text{.}   $$ Conjugation preserves order, and it also commutes with taking the   centralizer. Therefore, $g(x) ∈ A_{m/p}$ and $g(x) ∈ C_G(y_2)$ ,   so $g(xy_1'^k) ∈ f^{-1}(\{ y_2 \})$ , and thus $g(f^{-1}(\{ y_1' \})) ⊆ f^{-1}(\{ y_2 \})$ . The other inclusion   holds similarly. In particular, both inverse images have the same   size, and by the first part above $f^{-1}(\{y_1\})$ has the same size as $f^{-1}(\{y_2\})$ . $∎$ (Note that, unlike the commutative case, the exclusion of the identity is necessary. If $G = S_3$ and $p = 2$ , then each transposition has exactly one element in   the preimage of $f(x) = x^3$ (itself), but $e$ has three   elements in the preimage of $f$ ; $e$ itself and the two $3$ -cycles.)","In the course of proving some properties about an algorithm to pick an element of prime order from a finite group such that ( but ), I needed the following lemma: Lemma : Let have order with prime , and let .

Then $2^{p-1}\equiv1 \pmod p$. Let $m$ be the smallest divisor of $p - 1$ such that $2^m \equiv1 \pmod p$. Since $m$ is smaller than $p$ it must be coprime to $n$, so $n = qm + r$ with $0 < r < m$. Hence $2^r \equiv 1 \pmod p$. Contradiction. One can find this solution here (it's from an old Putnam exam). But I heard that there is a nice way to prove the claim utilizing group theory and Lagrange theorem. Could somebody provide such a proof?",,"['group-theory', 'number-theory']"

76,Checking understanding on proving uniqueness of identity and inverse elements of a group.,Checking understanding on proving uniqueness of identity and inverse elements of a group.,,"Sorry for such a trivial question, but just wanted to check my understanding. When proving a statement, for example, that the inverse of a group element is unique (in elementary group theory) one starts by supposing that there exists two inverses $h$ and $k$ for a given element $g \in G$, where $G$ is some group with binary operation $\ast:G\times G \rightarrow G$, such that $h\ast g = g\ast h = e$  and $k\ast g = g\ast k = e$ where $e \in G$ is the unique identity for the group $G$. From this, one can show that $h=k$ in the following manner: $$ h=h\ast e =h\ast\left( g\ast k\right) = \left(h\ast g\right)\ast k = e\ast k =k$$ and as such $h=k$.  Now, is the reason we can from this state that the inverse of an element $g\in G$ is unique because $h$ and $k$ were chosen arbitrarily, apart from the requirement that they are inverses of $g$, and as such, if we know the value of one of the inverses, say $h$, then we know that for any other value $k$ to be an inverse of $g$ it must be equivalent to the known inverse $h$, and thus $h$ is the unique inverse of $g$. Is this reasoning correct? Sorry for the wordiness of this question, but just wanted to check my understanding explicitly. Also, although I understand that, logically, I should have proven this first (but I'd already written out the inverses part before thinking of this, so apologies for that), but is the reasoning the same for arguing that the identity element of a group is unique? (i.e. If we assume that there are two identity elements $e,g \in G$ and subsequently show that $e=g$, then this implies that if we know the form of one of the identities, say $e$, then for any other value $g$ to be an identity of the group $G$ it must be equivalent to $e$ and thus the identity element of a group is unique).","Sorry for such a trivial question, but just wanted to check my understanding.

However, 2 compact Riemann surfaces may well be homeomorphic but not conformally equivalent.

That Fuchsian group is not unique though. My question is this : what is the notion of equivalence needed for two Fuchsian groups to generate the same (hyperbolic) Riemann surface ?

I felt that this wouldn't make much sense in this context, so I assumed this meant you could write each element of $G$ uniquely as a product of $n_1n_2$ where $n_1\in N_1,n_2\in N_2$. Then to prove this I wrote if $n_1n_2=n_1'n_2'$ then we have $n_1'^{-1}n_1=n_2'n_2^{-1}$, and since $N_1\cap N_2=\{e\}$ we have $n_1=n_1',n_2=n_2'$.
