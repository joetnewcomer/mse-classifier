I tried looking at a number like $n=10$ just to see what it looks like expanded.

But this isn't helping me see the how to move forward.

73,unexplained inequalities from Niven's 1971 proof $\sum 1/p$ diverges,unexplained inequalities from Niven's 1971 proof  diverges,\sum 1/p,"Ivan Niven published a much shorter and easier proof that the prime harmonic series $\sum 1/p$ diverges. The proof is now available as open access here in this link . In the short proof he makes use of two inequalities: $$ \left( \sum_{k<n}'1/k \right) \left( \sum_{j<n}1/j^2 \right) \geq \sum_{m<n} 1/m$$ $k$ are the square-free integers, $j$ and $m$ are ordinary integers, and $$\prod_{p<n}(1+1/p) \geq \sum_{k<n}'1/k$$ Question: Is there a simple logical rationale for why these inequalities hold? I can only verify these inequalities by hand, multiplying out series for small $n$ . Obviously this isn't proof, but doing this can sometimes reveal the more general logic. In this case I can't see it. I would appreciate solutions and comments that avoid technical terminology as I, and my students, are not university trained mathematicians. Update: Since Niven's article is now open access, here is a screenshot and a transcription: $$\text{A PROOF OF THE DIVERGENCE OF $\Sigma 1 / p$}$$ $$\text{Ivan Niven, University of Oregon}$$ First we prove that $\Sigma^{\prime} 1 / k$ diverges, where $\Sigma^{\prime}$ denotes the sum over the squarefree positive integers. Each positive integer is uniquely expressible as a product of a squarefree positive integer and a square, so for any positive integer $n$ , $$ \left({\sum_{k<n}}^{\prime} 1 / k\right)\left(\sum_{j<n} 1 / j^{2}\right) \color{red}\geqq \sum_{m<n} 1 / m $$ Here the second sum is bounded but the third sum is unbounded as $n$ increases, so the first sum must be unbounded. Next suppose that $\Sigma 1 / p$ converges to $\beta$ , the sum taken over all primes $p$ . By dropping all terms beyond $x$ in the series expansion of $e^{x}$ or $\exp (x),$ we see that $\exp (x)>1+x$ for $x>0 .$ Hence for each positive integer $n$ $$ \exp (\beta)>\exp \left(\sum_{p<n} 1 / p\right)=\prod_{p<n} \exp (1 / p)>\prod_{p<n}(1+1 / p) \color{red}\geqq {\sum_{k<n}}^{\prime} 1 / k $$ But this contradicts the unboundedness of the last sum, so $\Sigma 1 / p$ diverges.","Ivan Niven published a much shorter and easier proof that the prime harmonic series diverges.

93,Probability and the Collatz Problem,Probability and the Collatz Problem,,"A long time ago I was messing around with the Collatz problem and I stumbled across a “proof” that the iterations will converge. I was too embarrassed to show anyone, and I recently just remembered it. So I will put a sketch of it here and I want to know where it falls down. Define $C(n)$ as one iteration of the Collatz function on a positive integer $n$ . Assume we start at a random positive even integer $n$ . Define the probability that $C(n)$ is even by $P(C(n)\in \text{even})$ , or just $P(C(n))$ . For a random start number $P(C(n))=0.5$ . (remember that $n$ is even) But $P(C^{2}(n))=1/2\times P((C(n))+ (1-P(C(n)))$ . (By simple probability tree) And so on, in general $P(C^{k}(n))=1/2\times P(C^{k-1}(n))+(1-P(C^{k-1}(n)))=1-1/2\times P(C^{k-1}(n))$ Which gives us a geometric progression (with multiple -1/2) as we work our way back into terms of $P(C(n))$ . As $k \to \infty $ , $P(C^{k}(n))\to \frac{1}{1-(-1/2)}=2/3$ . So what? Well, this implies that as k gets bigger our iterations will settle down to something like an even-even-odd cycle (2/3 are even). Assume that on $k$ iterations of the Collatz function, we end up at a larger number than our initial number. This implies (assuming w.l.o.g. we have an even number, $x$ ) $3\times \frac{x}{4}+1$ is greater than $x$ . Or, $x<4$ . But we have checked for all numbers less than four and the Collatz function converges, so there is no number that will diverge. I know this is a very sketchy sketch of a “proof”. I just want to know what you think. If it is nonsense please say so. Edit: I also tried a different Collatz-style iterations, with $3x-1$ instead of $3x+1$ . As far qs it is observable this doesn’t seem to converge. Using the same arguments as my original question, we can see why. $3\times \frac{x}{4}-1$ is greater than $x$ when $x<-4$ . I also tried similar other changes using $3x+a$ for $a\in \{3,5,7,\ldots\}$ . If the iterations converge for all integers less than $4\times a$ then it is convergent for all (assuming my “proof” makes sense). Second Edit: I want to reply to some issues raised. Bare in mind this is not a formal proof, it’s just an idea of a way of making a proof. On the objection that, just because on average the iterations will yield a 2/3 chance of an even number, there may in fact be sequences that do not reduce to an even-even-odd sequence: If a particular sequence doesn’t end in a 2/3 chance of an even number, and in fact it contains more odd numbers, then (now I’m not sure how to say this mathematically) that sequence is as dense in the integers as the sequences that cycle to 1-4-2, as for any even number in the sequence there is an infinite number of even numbers that also join this sequence (i.e., just double any even number in the sequence again and again…). Therefore, since the average sequence ends in a 2/3 chance of an even number after $k\to \infty$ iterations, there must be a sequence that has a higher-thanh2/3 chance of yielding an even number. I cannot prove it yet but I think, just on considering it, that such a sequence cannot exist, because: as the sequence progresses the numbers would get smaller and smaller (e.g., if the prob of an even number is 3/4, then we can consider a even-even-even-odd sequence, which is the same as a even-even-odd sequence but with an extra division by two, so it would necessarily be smaller than the starting number. Meaning (a) it couldn’t cycle (b) it couldn’t diverge to infinity. i.e., it is impossible. (B.t.w., the above type of proof I’m trying to make is based on a type of proof I forget the name of - if the average of something is $x$ , but you can find something with a value less than $x$ , then there must exist an object with a value greater than $x$ .) On the objection that I am abusing the term probability and that this is akin to saying “there are no primes, because as we get to bigger and bigger numbers the probability of a certain number being prime approaches zero”: I think that, although I haven’t defined how I’m using probability axioms, I think saying $C(n)$ can either be even or odd, and given an arbitrary $n$ it is possible to talk about the probability of it being even. If $C(n)$ is even, then $C(n+2)$ is odd so it doesn’t matter where you are in the integers, the probability is always 1/2. I’m not sure why this is controversial.","A long time ago I was messing around with the Collatz problem and I stumbled across a “proof” that the iterations will converge.
