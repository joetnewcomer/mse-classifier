What is the sum of digits of $C$? After doing some research on the power of usual computers, I concluded that it would not be possible to calculculate this number and find the sums like this. So the solution must be pure mathematical. But I could not manage to find any path to a solution.

25,Could this odd insight help explain part of the difficulty in proving the Collatz Conjecture?,Could this odd insight help explain part of the difficulty in proving the Collatz Conjecture?,,"Background: Here's a crash course on the Collatz Conjecture . Basically, you take a number and if it is even you divide it by two. If a number is odd, you multiply it by three and then add one. You keep doing this until the number becomes 1. The conjecture says that performing this operation for any number eventually results in 1. A quick note on the numbers used, they must be positive non-zero integers. As pointed out by Gottfried, there are contradictions otherwise. Stating the above in mathematical form, $$n_{t+1} = \begin{cases} n_t/2,  & \text{if $n_t$ is even} \\ 3 \cdot n_t+1, & \text{if $n_t$ is odd} \end{cases}$$ What I found: Here's what was kind of surprising to me. If you perform $3 \cdot x+1$, where $x$ is odd, then you will always get an even number. However, ${x \over 2}$ doesn't always result in an odd number, if $x$ is even. My assumption is this, if one could figure out how many times you have to divide an even number by two to get an odd number, headway could be made in proving the conjecture. However, when I went to find $v_2(e)$, where $e$ is an even number, and $v_2(e)$ is the number of times you can divide the number by 2, I discovered a fractal like pattern! If you plot the values of this function, you get, $$1,2,1,3,1,2,1,4,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,5,1,2,\ldots$$ The first value is $v_2(2)$. The second is $v_2(4)$, and so on.

The up/down commands just add/substract from a counter. The plot command will actually plot the value, and move the independent variable up one. The values of $v_2(e)$ can be extracted from $C_n$ by ""reading"" $C_n$ left to right and adding $1$. The exponents, denote moving up/down $n-1$ times. Graphically, we have, Questions: Since this function $v_2(e)$ has a self-similar (fractal-like) nature, does that mean that the Collatz Problem is related to fractals? Could this be used to study the problem? Since fractals are inherently complex to compute in a linear fashion, could this explain why the conjecture is so hard to prove? I believe it explains some of the complex behavior of the iterates under the Collatz system. Addendum: Given an odd number, the next odd number in the Collatz iteration is given by, $$(1) \quad o_{t+1}={{3 \cdot o_t+1} \over {2^{v_2(3 \cdot o_t+1)}}}$$ Since any even number fed into the iteration is reduced to an odd number under the iteration, we need only consider odd numbers. Therefore, the Collatz conjecture is equivalent to the conjecture that the Dynamical System $(1)$ has one and only one fixed point and that this fixed point is $1$ and attractive. In addition, the basin of attraction for this fixed point is the entire set of positive odd numbers. Now we can finally see relevance of the self-similarity of $v_2(o_n)$.

So an ID $R$ is a Euclidean domain (ED) if there's some $\phi:R\backslash\{0\}\to\mathbf{Z}_{\geq0}$ or possibly $\mathbf{Z}_{>0}$ (I never know what $\mathbf{N}$ means, and the Wikipedia page (at the time of writing) uses $\mathbf{N}$ as the target of $\phi$, but in this case it doesn't matter, because I can just add one to $\phi$ if necessary) such that the usual axioms hold. Now onto subrings of the rationals. The subrings of the rationals turn out to be in bijection with the subsets of the prime numbers. If $X$ is a set of primes, then define $\mathbf{Z}_X$ to be the rationals $a/b$ with $b$ only divisible by primes in $X$.

By contraposition, the proposition can also be stated as: $$\text{If }n\in\mathbb N\text{ is not a square, then }\exists\,i\in\mathbb N^*\text{ with }2^{i-1}\le n\text{ and }\left(\dfrac{p_i}n\right)\ne+1$$ I don't know a counterexample for the stronger proposition with $2^i\le n$ . The proposition holds For $n=0$ , $n=1$ , and more generally any $n$ that is a square. For even $n>0$ , since for these $\left(\frac 2 n\right)=0\ne+1$ . Thus we can restrict to odd $n$ and use the Jacobi symbol rather than the Kronecker symbol. If $n\bmod8\in\{3,5\}$ , since for these $\left(\frac 2 n\right)=-1\ne+1$ . We can thus focus on $n\equiv\pm1\pmod8$ , and turn to use of the Legendre symbol : for $n\equiv+1\pmod8$ and odd $p_i$ , we can change $\left(\dfrac{p_i} n\right)=+1$ to $\left(\dfrac n{p_i}\right)=+1$ for $n\equiv-1\pmod8$ and odd $p_i$ , we can change $\left(\dfrac{p_i} n\right)=+1$ to $\left(\dfrac {-n}{p_i}\right)=+1$ .

Initial motivation: In some primality test algorithms we need the smallest $p_i$ with $\left(\dfrac{p_i}n\right)\ne+1$ .

A term function means a total computable function $\mathbb N^n\to\mathbb N$ with one or multiple arguments. Letters $m,n,k$ range over $\mathbb N$. Letters $f,g$ range over functions. A term sequence of functions $f_m(n)$ is just a different name for two-argument total computable function $f(m,n)$.

Every non-increasing sequence of polynomial towers stabilizes. Apparently, the proposition can be formalized as a purely arithmetical statement. I'm interested in a proof of this proposition that would not appeal to infinite sets in any way. For example, it should not use arbitrary infinite sequences or real numbers, except computable ones that can be represented by a corresponding algorithm, and it should not borrow any results from analysis, except those that can be proved in constructive analysis. We could use a theory of hereditary finite sets with natural numbers, computable functions, or any other finitary objects as urelements (they can be encoded as hereditary finite sets anyways).

Indeed, there a bijection between them (obtained by replacing $n$ with $\omega$ or vice versa), and it's not difficult to see that this bijection preserves order (where polynomial towers are ordered by domination, and ordinals ordered, as usual, by $\in$). So, the set of polynomial towers is order isomorphic to $\varepsilon_0$. Now, because every ordinal is well-ordered , we see that the set of polynomial towers is also well-ordered -- in other words, there is no infinite decreasing sequence of them. So, every infinite non-increasing sequence must stabilize. Of course, this proof uses many terms and lemmas that usually introduced and proved in terms of infinite sets.

59,Consecutive partitions of positive integers,Consecutive partitions of positive integers,,"Background (feel free to skip this part) Suppose we want to $k$-partition all the positive integers up to (and including) some integer $N$.  This partition should divide the numbers into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum. For example, for $N=4$, there is one possible $2$-partition:  $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $5$).  For another example, with $N=7$ there are multiple possible 2-partitions, one of which is: $\{1,2,4,7\},\{3,5,6\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $14$). We can see that in order for any $N$ to have a valid $2$-partition, we need $\sum_{i=1}^N i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ to be divisible by $2$, meaning $$N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 4} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 4}$$ It isn’t too difficult to determine similar requirements on $N$ for the existence of other $k$-partitions: $$k=3: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 6} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 3}$$ $$k=4: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 8} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 8}$$ $$\vdots$$ It might be interesting to investigate how many $k$-partitions there are for any given $N$, but I’m more interested in the problem of imposing restrictions on the partitions (which makes it more difficult to find the $N$ for which they exist). The problem Let’s say we want (what I have dubbed) a consecutive $k$-partition.  That is, divide the positive integers up to (and including) $N$ into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum and the sets are ordered, with the largest number in each set being 1 less than the smallest number in the next set.  (Clearly, if there exists a consecutive $k$-partition for $N$, there is only one such partition.) In the case $k=2$, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that: $$1+2+\ldots+a = (a+1)+(a+2)+\ldots+N$$ For example, for $N=3$ there is one possible consecutive $2$-partition: $\{1,2\},\{3\}$.  The next $N$ for which there exists a consecutive $2$-partition is $N=20$, where $a=14$ and we have: $$1+2+\ldots+14=105=15+16+\ldots+20$$ In general, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that $$\frac{a(a+1)}{2} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} - \frac{a(a+1)}{2},$$ which by the quadratic formula means we need $$a = \frac{\sqrt{2N^2 + 2N + 1}-1}{2}$$ to be a positive integer.  Since the root term will always be odd, the top will always be divisible by $2$, so we just need $$a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1$$ to be a square number. Interesting note: We want $a = Z^2$ for some positive integer $Z$, and we can write $a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1 = N^2 + (N+1)^2 = Z^2$, and the rightmost equation is precisely the set of Pythagorean triples $(X, X+1, Z)$.

By iterating $i$, we can generate $N$s which satisfy the first condition, and $N'$s which satisfy the second condition.  I have done this to generate $N$ and $N'$ all the way up to $10^{300}$, and there are none which satisfy both conditions! Does this make it very likely that no consecutive $3$-partitions exist? These recursive formulas can also be expressed in closed form: $$N_i = \frac{1}{4} \left((1+\sqrt{3})(2+\sqrt{3})^i + (1-\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3})^i - 2 \right)$$ $$N'_i = \frac{1}{4} \left((1+\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2})(5+2\sqrt{6})^i + (1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2})(5-2\sqrt{6})^i - 2 \right)$$ So the question becomes: $$\{N_i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z^+}\} \cap \{N'_i \mid i \in \mathbb{Z^+}\} = \emptyset?$$","Background (feel free to skip this part) Suppose we want to $k$-partition all the positive integers up to (and including) some integer $N$.  This partition should divide the numbers into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum. For example, for $N=4$, there is one possible $2$-partition:  $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $5$).  For another example, with $N=7$ there are multiple possible 2-partitions, one of which is: $\{1,2,4,7\},\{3,5,6\}$ (since the sum of the numbers in each is $14$). We can see that in order for any $N$ to have a valid $2$-partition, we need $\sum_{i=1}^N i = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ to be divisible by $2$, meaning $$N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 4} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 4}$$ It isn’t too difficult to determine similar requirements on $N$ for the existence of other $k$-partitions: $$k=3: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 6} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 3}$$ $$k=4: \quad N(N+1) \text{ divisible by 8} \Rightarrow N \text{ or } N+1 \text{ divisible by 8}$$ $$\vdots$$ It might be interesting to investigate how many $k$-partitions there are for any given $N$, but I’m more interested in the problem of imposing restrictions on the partitions (which makes it more difficult to find the $N$ for which they exist). The problem Let’s say we want (what I have dubbed) a consecutive $k$-partition.  That is, divide the positive integers up to (and including) $N$ into $k$ sets, such that each set has the same sum and the sets are ordered, with the largest number in each set being 1 less than the smallest number in the next set.  (Clearly, if there exists a consecutive $k$-partition for $N$, there is only one such partition.) In the case $k=2$, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that: $$1+2+\ldots+a = (a+1)+(a+2)+\ldots+N$$ For example, for $N=3$ there is one possible consecutive $2$-partition: $\{1,2\},\{3\}$.  The next $N$ for which there exists a consecutive $2$-partition is $N=20$, where $a=14$ and we have: $$1+2+\ldots+14=105=15+16+\ldots+20$$ In general, a consecutive $2$-partition exists for $N$ if we can find an $a$ such that $$\frac{a(a+1)}{2} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} - \frac{a(a+1)}{2},$$ which by the quadratic formula means we need $$a = \frac{\sqrt{2N^2 + 2N + 1}-1}{2}$$ to be a positive integer.  Since the root term will always be odd, the top will always be divisible by $2$, so we just need $$a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1$$ to be a square number. Interesting note: We want $a = Z^2$ for some positive integer $Z$, and we can write $a = 2N^2 + 2N + 1 = N^2 + (N+1)^2 = Z^2$, and the rightmost equation is precisely the set of Pythagorean triples $(X, X+1, Z)$. Using this formula, the next $N$ after $3$ then $20$ seems to be $119$, then $696$, then $4059$, then $23660$.  Clearly these grow farther apart, and a brute-force iteration over all the positive integers will be very slow in finding these.  Is there a formula to find $N$s for which this $a$ exists?

Then we can recover the primes from this sequence: $$ p = 2 + \sum_{q <p, q \text{ prime }} b_{p-1-q}$$ For example: For example the first coefficients are given by the series: $$2*t^{(-1)} + 1 + (-1)*t + 4*t^2 + (-5)*t^3 + 11*t^4 + (-16)*t^5 + 22*t^6 + (-37)*t^7 + 67*t^8 + (-101)*t^9 + 166*t^{10} + (-260)*t^{11} + 404*t^{12} + (-652)*t^{13} + \cdots $$ so $b_{-1} = 2, b_0 = 1, b_1 = -1 , b_2 = 4$ etc. We have for example: $$3 = 2+b_0 = 2+1$$ $$5 = 2+b_2+b_1 = 2+4-1$$ $$7 = 2+b_4+b_3+b_1 = 2+11-5-1$$ Let $a_{n,k}$ denote the number of ordered ways of writing $n$ as a sum of $k$ primes.  Then after some calculation, one finds that: $$a_{n,k} = \frac{k}{n-2k} \sum_{v=0}^{n-1} {a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v}}$$ which is a recurence relation. Furthermore if $\alpha_n$ $n=0,1,2,3,\cdots$ are all roots of $f(t)$ not equal to zero, then for $n\ge 0$ $$ b_n = - \sum_{k=0} ^ \infty \frac{1}{\alpha_k^{n+1}}$$ The numbers $b_n$ might be computed inductively using: $$ n a_{n,1} = \sum_{v=0}^n b_{v-1} a_{n-v,1}$$ from which one sees, that $b_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . One real root of $f(t)$ seems to be the number, $$ \gamma = -0.62923 \cdots $$ (OEIS: http://oeis.org/A078756 ) Since everything related to primes has something to do with the Riemann Zeta function, I wonder, what is the relation to the stuff above to the Riemann Zeta function? If someone knows of any reference or has any idea, that would be great. Is there for example a way to compute the real root $\gamma$ ? What is the relation of $\gamma$ to the other complex roots? What other properties do the numbers $b_n$ have? etc. Thanks for your help. Edit : I found a conjectural way to compute $\gamma$ and using the Euler Product a link to Riemann Zeta function: $$\zeta(s) = \prod_{p} {\frac{1}{1-(2+\sum_{q<p} b_{p-1-q})^{-s}}}$$ and for $\gamma$ numerical coincidences suggest that: $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b_n}{b_{n+1}} = \gamma = -0.629233\cdots$$ which could be one way to define $\gamma$ . Then one has to show, that this limit exists and that $f(\gamma) = 0$ . If someone has an idea in this direction,that would be nice. Second edit : Here is the computation for the recurence relation of $a_{n,k}$ : For $k\ge 1$ we have on the one hand: $$\log(f(t)^k)' = \frac{k f(t)^{k-1} f'(t)}{f(t)^k} = k \frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = \sum_{n=-1}^\infty k b_n t^n$$ On the other hand it is $$f(t)^k  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n,k}t^n$$ which means that $$\log(f(t)^k)' = \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty n a_{n,k} t^{n-1}}{\sum_{n=0}^\infty  a_{n,k} t^{n}}$$ Hence it follows, that (by multiplying with the denominator): $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty n a_{n,k} t^{n-1} = k (\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n,k} t^{n}) (\sum_{n=0} b_{n-1}t^n) \frac{1}{t}$$ After multiplying with $t$ and using the Cauchy product formula we get: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n a_{n,k} t^{n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty k( \sum_{v=0}^n a_{v,k}b_{n-1-v})t^n$$ and comparing coefficients we find that: $$n a_{n,k} = k ( \sum_{v=0}^n a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v})$$ and with $b_{-1} = 2$ it follows after solving this equation for $a_{n,k}$ that: $$ a_{n,k} = \frac{k}{n-2k} \sum_{v=0}^{n-1} a_{v,k} b_{n-1-v}$$ Especially for $k=1$ and $n=p$ prime we find that: $$ p = 2+ \sum_{q<p} b_{p-1-q}$$","Let where is the prime counting function.

65,Are there infinitely many sets of relatively prime numbers with equal number and sum of divisors?,Are there infinitely many sets of relatively prime numbers with equal number and sum of divisors?,,"Consider the prime factorization of the numbers $14$ and $15$ : $$14 = 2 \cdot 7 \implies \tau(14) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \space ;\space \sigma(14) = 3 \cdot 8 = 24$$ $$15=3 \cdot 5 \implies \tau(15) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \space ;\space \sigma(15) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24$$ Thus, we can note that $\tau(14) = \tau(15)$ and $\sigma(14) = \sigma(15)$ . Here, $\tau(x)$ is the number of positive divisors of $x$ and $\sigma(x)$ is the sum of positive divisors of $x$ . There are many examples such as $\{14,15\}$ that show the above properties. Another example is $\{33,35\}$ and $\{46,51,55\}$ . More than just pairs or triples, we can have even larger sets. The smallest sextuplet (set of six positive integers) is $\{282,310,322,345,357,385\}$ . We can see that as $\{14,15\}$ have their union of prime factors as $\{2,3,5,7\}$ and since the $\tau$ and $\sigma$ functions are multiplicative functions, we can take any positive integer $k$ such that $\gcd(k,210) = 1$ and then the family of solutions $\{14k,15k\}$ would satisfy the properties. Thus, there are infinitely many pairs of distinct positive integers with equal number of divisors and equal sum of divisors. However, the question gets more interesting if we ask whether there are infinitely many such pairs with relatively prime positive integers, i.e. whether there are infinitely many such families of solutions. The 'relatively prime' part is removed to untrivialize the problem. We could however look at it at a different angle. The problem is only trivial if we could multiply equal powers of primes $p$ . Thus, we could also ask if there are infinitely many pairs of positive integers $\{a,b\}$ such that $\tau(a) = \tau(b)$ and $\sigma(a) = \sigma(b)$ , with the condition that for no prime $p$ , $\nu_p(a) = \nu_p(b) \neq 0$ . This problem is deeply related with conjectures such as Dickson's conjecture and Schinzel's Hypothesis. However, it is much weaker than such problems. Yet, when we concentrate on certain cases, for example, $\tau(a)=\tau(b)=4$ where $a,b$ are both products of two distinct primes, we get for primes $p,q,r,s$ : $$(p+1)(q+1) = (r+1)(s+1)$$ By fixing $s=7$ and $q=3$ for example , we get $p+1 = 2r+2$ which gives that for primes $p,r$ ; we have $p=2r+1$ . Thus, we are taken to the Sophie-Germain problem. Our problem is solved directly by solving any such single cases of Dickson's conjecture. Primes approximately have $0.5$ probability to be $1 \pmod{4}$ and $0.5$ probability to be $3 \pmod{4}$ . Thus, it is expected that $8 \mid (p+1)(q+1)$ . Similarly, primes approximately have $0.5$ probability to be $1 \pmod{3}$ and $0.5$ probability to be $2 \pmod{3}$ . Thus, it is expected that $3 \mid (p+1)(q+1)$ . Hence, it is better to search for $(p+1)(q+1) = (r+1)(s+1) = 24k$ . It can be seen quite clearly that even such small cases of the problem are likely to generate infinitely many solutions, like the above. Thus, it seems most likely that the answer to this question is affirmative. We can extend our problem to not only pairs, but to sets of distinct positive integers of size $n$ . We can also extend our problem by asking whether there are arbitrarily large sets of distinct positive integers with equal number of divisors and equal sum of divisors. This seems likely from the example of the sextuplet. This also directly follows from the full-fledged version of Dickson's conjecture. Finally, this is a stronger version of our previous question as we cannot have infinitely many finite positive integers in a set as they would have finite value for $\sigma(x) \geqslant x$ , which would bound the size of the set.

78,ch. 8.3 Exercise 1 in Cohomology of Number Fields,ch. 8.3 Exercise 1 in Cohomology of Number Fields,,"Let $k$ be a number field, $S$ a set of places of $k$ , $k_S$ the maximal extension of $k$ unramified outside $S$ , $\mathcal{O}_S$ the subring of $k_S$ with $\nu_{\mathfrak{p}}(\alpha)\geq 0$ for all $\mathfrak{p}\not\in S$ , and $G_{S}$ the galois group $\text{Gal}(k_S/k)$ . I am considering the following exercise at the end of chapter 8.3 in Cohomology of Number Fields. Show the isomorphism $H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)\cong Br(k_S/k)$ My attempt was to consider the following exact sequence $$0\longrightarrow k_S^\times \longrightarrow I_{k_S}\longrightarrow C_{k_S}\longrightarrow 0$$ Where $I_{k_S}$ and $C_{k_S}$ are the Ideles and Idele class group of $k_S$ . (Note that if $k_S$ is an infinite extension, these are simply the Galois invariance of the absolute Ideles and Idele class group.) We take the cohomology long exact sequence of this exact sequence and obtain at $H^2$ : $$0\simeq H^1(G_S, C_{k_S})\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,k_S^\times)\simeq Br(k_S/k)\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,I_{k_S})\longrightarrow H^2(G_S, C_{k_S})$$ This gives an isomorphism $Br(k_S/k)\simeq \ker(H^2(G_S,I_{k_S})\to H^2(G_S, C_{k_S}))$ . Now suppose $k=\mathbb{Q}$ and $S=\{3,\infty\}$ , so $3^\infty|\#G_S$ . Since $C$ is a formation module (defn. 3.1.8 in Cohomology of Number Fields ) we have $H^2(G_S,C_{k_S})\simeq \frac{1}{\#G_S}\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{Z}$ . On the other hand, for $H^2(G_S,I_{k_S})$ we have $$H^2(G_S,I_{k_S})(3)\simeq H^2(k,I)(3)\simeq \bigoplus_{\mathfrak p} H^2(k_{\mathfrak p})(3)\simeq \bigoplus_{\mathfrak p} \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3$$ by propositions $8.1.8$ and $8.1.7$ of the same book. (Note that we are using $A(p)$ to denote the $p$ -power torsion of $A$ .) Altogether, this yields $$Br(k_S/k)(3)=H^2(G_S,k_S^\times)(3)\simeq \ker \left(\bigoplus_{\mathfrak p} \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3\longrightarrow \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3\right)$$ where the map is given by summation. Now by 8.3.11 of the same book, we have $$H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)(p)\simeq \ker\left(\bigoplus_{\mathfrak p\in S\setminus S_\infty} \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3\longrightarrow \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3\right)=\ker(\mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3\to \mathbb{Q}_3/\mathbb{Z}_3)\simeq 0.$$ So these are two formulas, one for the $3$ -part of $Br(k_S/k)$ and another for the $3$ -part of $H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)$ . One is trivial and the other is decidedly not trivial, so they cannot be isomorphic. Here is another approach I took, which similarly suggested that the groups are not isomorphic, or at least not canonically isomorphic. We have a canonical embedding $\mathcal{O}_S^\times\to k_S^\times$ , and we would hope the isomorphism of their Brauer groups is induced by this embedding. To that end, suppose for simplicity that $k=\mathbb{Q}$ and $S=\{2,5,7,\dots,\infty\}$ . we consider the following exact sequence $$0\longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_S^\times \longrightarrow  k_S^\times \longrightarrow  \prod_{\mathfrak{p}|3} \mathfrak{p}^{\mathbb{Z}}=A$$ where the product is over the primes $\mathfrak{p}$ lying over $3$ and the last map need not be surjective. To turn this into a short exact sequence, we would like to determine the image of the last map. To do this, fix a prime $\mathfrak{p}^*$ lying over $3$ , and let $D\subseteq G_S$ be its decomposition group. The $A$ can be described as the set of functions $f:G_S\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that $f(\sigma\tau)=f(\tau)$ for all $\sigma \in D$ . We identify each prime $\mathfrak{p}$ in the product with a coset of $G/H$ , and then for $a\in A$ we set $f_a(H\sigma)=\nu_{(\mathfrak{p}^*)^\sigma}(a)$ . To determine the image of $k_S$ in $A$ , note that anything in the image must be a continuous function. To see this, observe that any $\alpha \in k_S$ is in a Galois subextension $k_S/K/k$ , and $f_\alpha$ then factors through the finite quotient $\text{Gal}(K/k)$ and is therefore continuous by properties of the Krull topology. Furthermore, all such continuous functions are possible: if $f\in A$ is continuous, then it factors through some finite quotient of $G_S$ , and we can pass to the corresponding extension of $k$ to find a suitable $\alpha$ . With this description of the image of $k_S^\times$ in $A$ in mind, it becomes clear that we have constructed an isomorphism $$k_S^\times/\mathcal{O}_S^\times\simeq \text{Ind}^D_{G_S}(\mathbb{Z})$$ since the collection of such continuous functions is precisely the definition of the induced module. Taking the long exact sequence in cohomology, we obtain $$H^1(G_S,\text{Ind}^D_{G_S}(\mathbb{Z}))\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,k_S^\times)\longrightarrow  H^2(G_S,\text{Ind}^D_{G_S}(\mathbb{Z}))\longrightarrow H^3(G_S,\mathcal{O}_{S}^\times) $$ Computing the first and fourth term in this sequence, we obtain $$H^1(G_S,\text{Ind}^D_{G_S}(\mathbb{Z}))\simeq H^1(D,\mathbb{Z})\simeq H^1(\hat{\mathbb{Z}},\mathbb{Z})\simeq \varinjlim H^1(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})\simeq 0$$ $$H^2(G_S,\text{Ind}^D_{G_S}(\mathbb{Z}))\simeq H^2(D,\mathbb{Z})\simeq H^2(\hat{ \mathbb{Z}},\mathbb{Z})\simeq H^1(\hat{\mathbb{Z}},\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}.$$ Taking the $p$ -part of this exact sequence for $p\neq 3$ and using 8.3.11, we obtain $$0\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)(p)\longrightarrow H^2(G_S,k_S^\times)(p)\longrightarrow \mathbb{Q}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p\longrightarrow 0.$$ Once again, we find that $H^2(G_S,\mathcal{O}_S^\times)$ is only a subobject of $H^2(G_S,k_S^\times)$ , and similarly the failure for it to be an isomorphism comes from the primes not in $S$ . The ideas here apply more generally for other $S$ and $k$ and you still get a nontrivial cokernel of the inclusion in those cases. I do not immediately see a flaw with either of these arguments, and the fact that they both show the exercise being false makes me think it might just be a mistake in the book, but I am far too aware of my shortcomings to believe this, so I am hoping someone can point out a mistake in these arguments.","Let be a number field, a set of places of , the maximal extension of unramified outside , the subring of with for all , and the galois group .

One is trivial and the other is decidedly not trivial, so they cannot be isomorphic. Here is another approach I took, which similarly suggested that the groups are not isomorphic, or at least not canonically isomorphic. We have a canonical embedding , and we would hope the isomorphism of their Brauer groups is induced by this embedding. To that end, suppose for simplicity that and . we consider the following exact sequence where the product is over the primes lying over and the last map need not be surjective.

79,Hard system in integers related to natural number representations,Hard system in integers related to natural number representations,,"Update: Observing a necessary condition, and ""unbalanced"" variation A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a number to be a solution to this Diophantine system (Representing ""balanced"" triple palindromes ) presented in the "" The problem-system "" section of this question, is for it to be a solution of the following linked Diophantine System (Representing ""balanced"" double palindromes ). Number is a triple (double) palindrome if it is palindromic in three (two) consecutive number bases. Double and triple palindromes are ""balanced"", if they have the same number of digits in all of their consecutive palindromic bases. Otherwise, they are unbalanced. Unbalanced variation of this problem is not known if it has solutions or not , at all; Does there exits an ""unbalanced"" triple palindrome ? I suspect that there are finitely many ""unbalanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits? - where it is also not known if an unbalanced triple palindrome exists. This conjecture was motivated by the fact that the opposite is true for ""balanced"" double palindromes : It is known that there exists infinitely many ""balanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits . Update on $d\ge 5$ cases The case $d=5$ is now proven computationally. But the case is still referenced as conjectured in the text below. - A human solution would still be very useful if possible. ( Can we bypass the 2-palindrome step and solve directly for 3-palindromes? ) The solutions for 2-palindromes from this answer's $d=5$ case are extendable computationally to base $b-2$ and yield the conjectured $d=5$ solutions presented here. I'm not sure if it is possible to do the similar thing with $d\ge 7$ . - The obstacle being the limitations of using a CAS to solve the given system of equations. Table of contents This post will be a bit longer than usual, so here is a table of contents: Problem and progress : Stating the problem and presenting known solutions so far. Questions on possible ways to continue making progress? Context of the problem and some basic stated theory used to prove $d=3$ solutions. Going over the proof of $d=3$ , can we extend it to conjectured $d=5,7,\dots$ solutions? Related problems and the generalized system-problem, motivation In short, progress in this helps solve problems related to special numbers  that depend on representations in multiple number bases, especially ones that deal with the digits of the number. Such as the two linked questions on existence of a $4$ -palindrome and finding $3$ -palindromes. Problem and progress The problem-system Let $a_i,A_i,B_i,o_i,h_i,b,d\in\mathbb N_0,i\in\{1,\dots,d\}$ be non-negative integers. Can we solve: $$ 0 \le a_i\lt b,a_1\ne0 \\ 0 \le A_i=A_{d-i+1}\lt b-1,A_1\ne 0\\ 0 \le B_i=B_{d-i+1}\lt b-2,B_1\ne 0 $$ If it is given $d\gt 1$ , and: $$ a_{j}=a_{d-j+1},j\in\{1\dots d\} \\ A_i=\sum_{k=1}^{i}\binom{d-k}{i-k}a_k + o_{i} - o_{i-1} (b-1) \\ B_i=\sum_{k=1}^{i}\binom{d-k}{i-k}2^{i-k}a_k + h_{i} - h_{i-1} (b-2) $$ For all $(a_1,\dots,a_d;b),o_i,h_i$ that satisfy these conditions? Where also note that $o_i,h_i=0$ for $i=0,d$ . These equations in short, arise from: $$ \sum_{k=1}^d a_kb^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^d A_k(b-1)^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^d B_k(b-2)^{d-k} $$ By writing $A_k,B_k$ in terms of $a_k$ , and using $o_i,h_i$ to regularize the equations - which is explained in the context of the problem part of this post. When the equations are regularized by $o_i,h_i$ , the $a_k,A_k,B_k$ can be viewed as digits of a number in bases $b,b-1,b-2$ that are required to be palindromic by the problem-system . Progress so far $(0)\space$ If solution exists: $(a_1,\dots,a_d;b)$ for some $d$ , then $o_i,h_i$ that allow it are unique. $(1)\space$ If $d$ is even, the system has no solutions. $(2)\space$ If $d=3$ , I have all the solutions. $(3^*)\space$ For $d=5,7$ , I conjecture I have all the solutions. $(4^*)\space$ For $d\ge 9$ , I suspect there are no solutions, or at most finitely many solutions. I do not have yet any examples (counterexamples) for this. $(\infty)\space$ Mathematica can solve any $d$ case for $(a_1,\dots,a_d)$ , but for one fixed $b$ at a time. Observation: If there are families of infinitely many solutions, they will appear periodically among consecutive values of $b$ . Otherwise, only a finite number of solutions could exist, for small enough values of $b$ . This observation can be used to computationally solve individual $d$ cases - but I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions, because I do not know how to set up any upper bounds, even thought they should clearly exist in the context of periods and the smallest base after which all periods should be visible. Known infinite families of solutions For $d=3,5,7$ , I strongly conjecture I have all such solutions. For $d=3$ only, I managed to actually prove it by exhausting all $o_i,h_i$ cases (by going over all regularized expressions ) systematically ( which is explained by the end of this post ). For convenience, lets write the the solutions in terms of the smallest one $+$ increment for $a_i$ terms, and $b$ in terms of a constant $+$ period of the solutions in the family. Also, since $a_i=a_{d-i+1}$ , we can write solutions by writing only the first $\frac{d+1}{2}$ values of $a_i$ . Then: We have for $k\in\mathbb N_0$ the families with infinitely many solutions: $$ (a_1+c_1k,\dots,a_{(d+1)/2}+c_{(d+1)/2}k)=(a_i)+(c_i)k $$ $$ \begin{array}{l,l,l,l} d & (a_i)&(c_i)k & b\\ d=3 & (2,6)&(1,1)k & 2k+8\\ d=5 & (31,32,0)&(3,2,1)k & 4k+47 \\ d=7 & (34,50,10,74)&(1,1,1,1)k & 2k+76 \\ d=7 & (8,33,0,41)&(1,3,1,3)k & 6k+58 \\ d=7 & (112,15,0,36)&(4,0,1,0)k & 6k+175 \\ d=7 & (227,160,187,200)&(5,3,5,3)k & 6k+280 \\ d=7 & (5,23,6,14)&(2,6,5,0)k & 12k+39 \\ d=7 & (93,78,30,50)&(10,6,7,0)k & 12k+119 \\ d=7 & (47,150,249,26)&(2,6,11,0)k & 12k+291 \\ \end{array} $$ Notice solutions for $d=3,5,7$ have (largest) periods $p=2,4,12$ . For $d=9,11$ , if infinite solution families exist, period is greater than $500,300$ respectively. (Checked bases $b$ from $10^9$ to $10^9+p$ ), which seems unlikely - That is, it seems unlikely that these cases have solutions at all- And this would be an unexpected result for me. Known finite sets of solutions We have for $d=3$ the $(3,6;9)$ solution, for $d=5$ none, for $d=7$ we have $12$ solutions among $b$ from $11$ to $51$ . For $d=9,11$ there also seem to be none so far. Question - Possible ways to make progress? Fully solve the system? $Q_1:$ Is it possible to solve this problem-system for general   expressions in terms of $b$ ? I can do it for one fixed $b$ at a time like mentioned in $(\infty)$ claim, then find general expressions in terms of $b$ by observing consecutive $b$ values. For example, like I did for $d=3,5,7$ . But I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions I have missed. If it is not possible to directly find (prove all) solutions in terms of $b$ for given $d$ , an alternate way that could attack this problem, partially instead: Start partially solving cases of $d$ ? $Q_2:$ Can we give an upper bound on the period $p$ for solutions of   the infinite families, and an upper bound for the value $b$ after   which no new families can exist? For example, for $d=3,5,7$ , these periods are exactly $p=2,4,12$ , and such $b$ are exactly $b_p=8,47,291$ . (True for $d=3$ , conjectured for $d=5,7$ ). If we can find such upper bounds, the lower bounds can be increased computationally using $(\infty)$ claim, until reacing or surprassing the upper bounds, and thus we can start proving all solutions for one case of $d$ at a time. Computationally solve (prove) cases of $d$ ? $Q_3:$ Is it possible to generalize the approach used to prove $d=3$ ,   and make a CAS use it to prove individual cases of $d$ systematically? But I'm having trouble figuring out how to systematically go over all regularized expressions for given $d$ in an effective and usable way. - Which $o_i,h_i$ combinations make sense to verify for solutions and which ones can we disprove (prove yield no solutions)? Context of the problem and theory for proving $d=3$ case The context of the system The context in which this problem-system arises is, the problem of finding all $3$ -palindromes. - Numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases. We are also requiring them to have $d$ digits in those number bases. Lets define a number representation in base $b$ , but also allow the irregular representations - that the digit are $\in\mathbb Z$ or $\ge b$ . Every number $n\in\mathbb N$ has infinitely many irregular expressions in base $b$ , and one unique expression  - the standard regular representation in a number base. $$n=\overline{a'_1a'_2\dots a'_{d'}}=(a_1,\dots,a_d)_{b}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_kb^{d-k}$$ For example: $100=(1,0,0)_{10}=(1,2,1)_{9}=(2,-7,1)_{9}=(11,1)_{9}=\dots$ Where the first two expressions are regular , and the other two are irregular . From here, we can get the inequalities by definition for some $n\in\mathbb N$ : $$n=(a_i)_b=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_kb^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}a_k((b-1)+1)^{d-k}=\sum_{k=1}^{d}A_k(b-1)^{d-k}=(A_i)_{b-1}$$ Where you expand $a_k((b-1)+1)^{d-k}$ by binomial theorem to get the expressions for $A_i$ , which are given at the beginning if you ignore the $o_i$ parameters. In this case, the representation given by $A_i$ is irregular , unless $A_i<b-1$ for all $i$ , but in that case, we cannot have a palindrome in $b-1$ (observe the formula for $A_i$ without $o_i$ parameters). This means we are working with irregular expression for $A_i$ if we want to find solutions. Regularizing the representations This is where $o_i$ parameters come into place. To actually check for the digits $A_i$ to make a palindrome in base $b-1$ , they need to be a part of the regular expression. This means we need to regularize these $A_i$ expressions so they make up a regular representation in number base $b-1$ . Only then we can actually verify whether $n$ can be palindromic in $b-1$ . By definition, you can borrow ""from"" or ""to"" neighbouring digits, without changing the value of $n$ , like so: $$ n=(\dots,a_t,a_{t+1},\dots)_b=(\dots,a_t+o_{t},a_{t+1}-o_{t}b,\dots)_b $$ For $o_i\in\mathbb Z$ . But since we have observed that $A_i\lt b-1$ does not work assuming $(A_i)_b$ is regular for all $o_i=0$ , and since $A_i\gt 0$ , we need to reduce the $A_i$ digits to get to a regular representation. Thus, we can work with $o_i\in\mathbb N_0$ . Similar story with $B_i$ and base $b-2$ , and ""borrowings"" to regularize the expression with $h_i$ . If we were working with $b,b+1,b+2$ instead of $b,b-1,b-2$ , then $o_i,h_i$ could also be negative, which gives a harder system to analyse. Claims $(0)$ and $(1)$ From the uniqueness of the regular expression and definition of $o_i,h_i$ , the $(0)$ follows easily. The $(1)$ is true (for the presented system at the beginning), since it can be shown that if a number is palindromic in number base $b$ and has an even number of digits, then it is divisible by $b+1$ . This means if we have a palindrome with $d=2l$ digits in base $b-1$ , then it cannot be palindromic in base $b$ , because of divisibility it should end with $0$ , and we have that $a_1,A_1\ne0$ . Solving the system for $d=3$ - proving $(2)$ claim. Here, the system presented at the beginning is based on bases $b,b-1,b-2$ and works in terms of $o_i,h_i$ . By using the definition of irregular expressions , we can avoid writing down $o_i,h_i$ and the system explicitly. We will first find all $2$ -palindromes then extend to $3$ -palidnromes. We will do this, by finding all possible regularized expressions for base $b-1$ by going over $o_i$ parameters. Then we will go over $h_i$ just for the now found $2$ -palindromes, to again find and check all regular expressions for being a palindrome. We have that: $$n=(a_1,a_2,a_1)_b=(A_1,A_2,A_3)_{b-1}=(a_1,2a_1 + a_2,2a_1+ a_2)_{b-1}$$ We will observe two cases: $1.)\space a_1 \le a_2$ , That is, we can parameterize: $a_2 = a_1 + r_1,r_1\in\mathbb N_0$ . Now we can also parameterize the number base: $$b=\max\{a_1,a_2\}+t=a_2+t=a_1+r_1+t,t\in\mathbb N$$ Like this, since $a_1,a_2$ need to be $<b$ , since $(a_1,a_2,a_1)_b$ is a regular expression. Now we have: $$ (A_i)_{b-1}=(a_1,3a_1 + r_1,3a_1+ r_1)_{a_1+r_1+t-1} $$ If we assume $b-1\gt 3a_1+r_1$ , then we have a regular expression, but it can't be a palindrome since $A_1=a_1\lt A_3=3a_1+r_1 \implies A_1\ne A_3$ . Thus, $b-1\le 3a_1+r_1$ . Now we have an irregular expression. Lets regularize it: $$ (a_1,3a_1 + r_1,3a_1+ r_1)_{b-1} \\ =(a_1+1,3a_1 + r_1-(b-1)+1,3a_1+ r_1-(b-1))_{b-1} \\ =(1+a_1,2-t+2 a_1,1-t+2 a_1)_{a_1+r_1+t-1} \\ $$ By applying the first case of $o_i$ parameters - By using the ""borrowings"" to satisfy regularization under $b-1\le 3a_1+r_1$ condition. Now this is either regularized or not. If you assume not, and continue going for other cases of $o_i$ and regularizing in all other possible ways, you'll every time reach a case with no solutions for $A_1=A_3$ . Thus lets assume this is now regularized. Thus we need to solve: $$ A_1=A_3\iff 1+a_1=1-t+2 a_1\iff t=a_1 $$ If you also look at the conditions under which this is regularized, you'll get: $$ (c_1):\space (1 \le a_1 \le 3 \land r_1 \ge 4 - a_1) \lor (a_1 \ge 4 \land r_1 \ge 0) $$ We have now solved case $1.)$ for $2$ -palindromes. That is, we have solutions: $$ (a_1,a_2;b)=(a_1,a_1+r_1;2a_1+r_1),a_1,r_1\in\mathbb N\land(c_1) $$ Or in the context of $2$ -palindromes: $$ (a_1,a_1+r_1,a_1)_{2a_1+r_1}=(1+a_1,2+a_1,1+a_1)_{2a_1+r_1-1} $$ Now we need to check the expression in base $b-2$ and go over all regular expressions by going over $h_i$ combinations. After now checking these for $B_i$ conditions for base $b-2$ , you can show that the final solution to the $d=3$ for case $1.)$ is: $$ (a_1,a_2;b)=(a-2,a+2;2a),a\ge 4 \lor  (a_1,a_2;b)=(3,6;9) $$ Or in $3$ -palindrome context (the first part, the second part is just number $n=300$ in bases $9,8,7$ ): $$ (a-2,a+2,a-2)_{2a}=(a-1,a,a-1)_{2a-1}=(a,a+1,a)_{2a-2},a\ge 4 $$ Now, in a similar way, you can handle the $2.)\space a_1\gt a_2$ case, and find all $2$ -palindromes in bases $b,b-1$ . But when checking for $B_i$ as well, for base $b-2$ , there will be no final solutions for $3$ -palindromes. That is, for $2.)\space a_1\gt a_2$ , we can show there aren't any solutions after doing a similar process for $A_i$ and then finally considering $B_i$ conditions as well. Thus, we can show the final solution for $d=3$ is: $$ (a_1,a_2;b)=(a-2,a+2;2a),a\ge 4 \lor  (a_1,a_2;b)=(3,6;9) $$ Which agrees with solutions given in $(2)$ claim. Generalizing the proof for $(2)$ claim? Is it possible to implement this process in a CAS? To solve for any given $d$ in general? I've tried in Mathematica , but I'm not sure how to properly go over   all regular expression. My idea was to go over all $\frac{d+1}{2}!$ cases of permuting $a_i$ in $a_1\le a_2\le \dots\le a_{(d+1)/2}$ . Now we can parameterize the base $b=\max\{a_i\}+t,t\in\mathbb N$ , and every digit in terms of $r_i\in\mathbb N_0$ and $\min\{a_i\}$ . Then, what is left, is to go over all regular expressions in each of these cases, and then solve just the system of equalities $A_i=A_{d-i+1}$ now. This will give all $2$ -palindromes. What is left then, is to apply the same process but now only for these $2$ -palindromes, and in base $b-2$ . We will be again solving just a system of equalities $B_i=B_{d-i+1}$ in every case, for every regular expression in that case. But I had trouble going over all regular expressions and of keeping track of $o_i,h_i$ that make sense to consider (Not all need to be considered, depending on the sizes and conditions so far on $b,A_i,B_i$ ), and also getting duplicate solutions for $2$ -palindromes in supposedly different regularized expressions. And on top of that, it was running extremely slowly to find the next set of $2$ -palindrome solutions for $d\gt 3$ . So I'm not sure how to implement this process properly, or if it can actually work for a general case of $d$ in current CAS that are avaliable? Generalized system and related problems This system of inequalities and palindromic equalities , is related to the a bit more general similar system - where there can be more $A_i,B_i$ expressions instead of exactly $d$ such expressions. The general problem The generalized inequalities also allows $A_i,B_i$ for $i\le 0$ , where then they are just given as: $$ A_i=o_{i} - o_{i-1} (b-1) \\ B_i=h_{i} - h_{i-1} (b-2) $$ And if $i_A$ is the smallest such $i$ for which $A_i$ is not zero, and if $i_B$ is the smallest such $i$ for which $B_i$ is not zero, then the system we are solving changes to: $$ A_{i_A}=A_d,A_{i_A+1}=A_{d-1},\dots \le b-1,A_{i_A}\ne 0 \\ B_{i_B}=B_d,A_{i_B+1}=B_{d-1},\dots \le b-2,B_{i_B}\ne 0 \\ $$ Such that the equalities stay palindromic. And now these along with given $a_i=a_{d-i+1}$ , actually represent equations for digits of a number $n\in\mathbb N$ in number bases $b,b-1,b-2$ , which are required to be palindromic in all of those three number  bases, which is the context this system was found in. Find all numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases? That have $d$ digits in number base $b$ . In the general problem , number of digits does not need to be equal in all number bases as implied by $i_A,i_B$ - just in the base $b$ , where $b-1,b-2$ could have more digits. If $i_A,i_B=1$ , that is, the problem-system in this post is given, then number of digits, is required to be equal in all bases $b,b-1,b-2$ and is exactly $d$ . Related problems Even thought related problems imply the generalized system , all infinite families of solutions that are known so far, are given by the problem-system, $i_A=i_B=1$ . Also note that in the related problems (of mine), it is considered $b,b+1,b+2$ instead of $b,b-1,b-2$ , and it is talked in context of palindromes themselves, as those posts predate this system and the $b,b-1,b-2$ approach. - Which is equivalent to $b,b+1,b+2$ in terms of solutions, but easier to work with in the terms of the problem-system. The related problems and motivation: The motivation behind searching for these so called $3$ -palindromes, is to answer the question, whether there exists a $4$ -palindrome ? The solutions from $(2),(3^*)$ were already mentioned in a question that is asking about $3$ -palindromes in that context, without setting up a system. Note that as those questions predate this system and the ability to solve for any fixed $b$ using it in Mathematica - I used to have to run an optimized brute force search in c++ instead, which was exponentially slower and was impossible to be used on bases like $10^9$ which now take similar time as bases $10^2$ . - Now the computations are still exponentially related to $d$ , but near constant time related to $b$ , where they used to be exponentially related to both in a brute force search. Motivation Similar systems could be set up for problems that depend on digits of numbers in number bases - or for diophantine equations that can be related to such problems.","Update: Observing a necessary condition, and ""unbalanced"" variation A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a number to be a solution to this Diophantine system (Representing ""balanced"" triple palindromes ) presented in the "" The problem-system "" section of this question, is for it to be a solution of the following linked Diophantine System (Representing ""balanced"" double palindromes ). Number is a triple (double) palindrome if it is palindromic in three (two) consecutive number bases. Double and triple palindromes are ""balanced"", if they have the same number of digits in all of their consecutive palindromic bases. Otherwise, they are unbalanced. Unbalanced variation of this problem is not known if it has solutions or not , at all; Does there exits an ""unbalanced"" triple palindrome ? I suspect that there are finitely many ""unbalanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits? - where it is also not known if an unbalanced triple palindrome exists. This conjecture was motivated by the fact that the opposite is true for ""balanced"" double palindromes : It is known that there exists infinitely many ""balanced"" double palindromes for every fixed case of digits . Update on cases The case is now proven computationally. But the case is still referenced as conjectured in the text below. - A human solution would still be very useful if possible. ( Can we bypass the 2-palindrome step and solve directly for 3-palindromes? ) The solutions for 2-palindromes from this answer's case are extendable computationally to base and yield the conjectured solutions presented here. I'm not sure if it is possible to do the similar thing with . - The obstacle being the limitations of using a CAS to solve the given system of equations. Table of contents This post will be a bit longer than usual, so here is a table of contents: Problem and progress : Stating the problem and presenting known solutions so far. Questions on possible ways to continue making progress? Context of the problem and some basic stated theory used to prove solutions. Going over the proof of , can we extend it to conjectured solutions? Related problems and the generalized system-problem, motivation In short, progress in this helps solve problems related to special numbers  that depend on representations in multiple number bases, especially ones that deal with the digits of the number. Such as the two linked questions on existence of a -palindrome and finding -palindromes. Problem and progress The problem-system Let be non-negative integers. Can we solve: If it is given , and: For all that satisfy these conditions? Where also note that for . These equations in short, arise from: By writing in terms of , and using to regularize the equations - which is explained in the context of the problem part of this post. When the equations are regularized by , the can be viewed as digits of a number in bases that are required to be palindromic by the problem-system . Progress so far If solution exists: for some , then that allow it are unique. If is even, the system has no solutions. If , I have all the solutions. For , I conjecture I have all the solutions. For , I suspect there are no solutions, or at most finitely many solutions. I do not have yet any examples (counterexamples) for this. Mathematica can solve any case for , but for one fixed at a time. Observation: If there are families of infinitely many solutions, they will appear periodically among consecutive values of . Otherwise, only a finite number of solutions could exist, for small enough values of . This observation can be used to computationally solve individual cases - but I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions, because I do not know how to set up any upper bounds, even thought they should clearly exist in the context of periods and the smallest base after which all periods should be visible. Known infinite families of solutions For , I strongly conjecture I have all such solutions. For only, I managed to actually prove it by exhausting all cases (by going over all regularized expressions ) systematically ( which is explained by the end of this post ). For convenience, lets write the the solutions in terms of the smallest one increment for terms, and in terms of a constant period of the solutions in the family. Also, since , we can write solutions by writing only the first values of . Then: We have for the families with infinitely many solutions: Notice solutions for have (largest) periods . For , if infinite solution families exist, period is greater than respectively. (Checked bases from to ), which seems unlikely - That is, it seems unlikely that these cases have solutions at all- And this would be an unexpected result for me. Known finite sets of solutions We have for the solution, for none, for we have solutions among from to . For there also seem to be none so far. Question - Possible ways to make progress? Fully solve the system? Is it possible to solve this problem-system for general   expressions in terms of ? I can do it for one fixed at a time like mentioned in claim, then find general expressions in terms of by observing consecutive values. For example, like I did for . But I have no ways of proving there aren't any more solutions I have missed. If it is not possible to directly find (prove all) solutions in terms of for given , an alternate way that could attack this problem, partially instead: Start partially solving cases of ? Can we give an upper bound on the period for solutions of   the infinite families, and an upper bound for the value after   which no new families can exist? For example, for , these periods are exactly , and such are exactly . (True for , conjectured for ). If we can find such upper bounds, the lower bounds can be increased computationally using claim, until reacing or surprassing the upper bounds, and thus we can start proving all solutions for one case of at a time. Computationally solve (prove) cases of ? Is it possible to generalize the approach used to prove ,   and make a CAS use it to prove individual cases of systematically? But I'm having trouble figuring out how to systematically go over all regularized expressions for given in an effective and usable way. - Which combinations make sense to verify for solutions and which ones can we disprove (prove yield no solutions)? Context of the problem and theory for proving case The context of the system The context in which this problem-system arises is, the problem of finding all -palindromes. - Numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases. We are also requiring them to have digits in those number bases. Lets define a number representation in base , but also allow the irregular representations - that the digit are or . Every number has infinitely many irregular expressions in base , and one unique expression  - the standard regular representation in a number base. For example: Where the first two expressions are regular , and the other two are irregular . From here, we can get the inequalities by definition for some : Where you expand by binomial theorem to get the expressions for , which are given at the beginning if you ignore the parameters. In this case, the representation given by is irregular , unless for all , but in that case, we cannot have a palindrome in (observe the formula for without parameters). This means we are working with irregular expression for if we want to find solutions. Regularizing the representations This is where parameters come into place. To actually check for the digits to make a palindrome in base , they need to be a part of the regular expression. This means we need to regularize these expressions so they make up a regular representation in number base . Only then we can actually verify whether can be palindromic in . By definition, you can borrow ""from"" or ""to"" neighbouring digits, without changing the value of , like so: For . But since we have observed that does not work assuming is regular for all , and since , we need to reduce the digits to get to a regular representation. Thus, we can work with . Similar story with and base , and ""borrowings"" to regularize the expression with . If we were working with instead of , then could also be negative, which gives a harder system to analyse. Claims and From the uniqueness of the regular expression and definition of , the follows easily. The is true (for the presented system at the beginning), since it can be shown that if a number is palindromic in number base and has an even number of digits, then it is divisible by . This means if we have a palindrome with digits in base , then it cannot be palindromic in base , because of divisibility it should end with , and we have that . Solving the system for - proving claim. Here, the system presented at the beginning is based on bases and works in terms of . By using the definition of irregular expressions , we can avoid writing down and the system explicitly. We will first find all -palindromes then extend to -palidnromes. We will do this, by finding all possible regularized expressions for base by going over parameters. Then we will go over just for the now found -palindromes, to again find and check all regular expressions for being a palindrome. We have that: We will observe two cases: , That is, we can parameterize: . Now we can also parameterize the number base: Like this, since need to be , since is a regular expression. Now we have: If we assume , then we have a regular expression, but it can't be a palindrome since . Thus, . Now we have an irregular expression. Lets regularize it: By applying the first case of parameters - By using the ""borrowings"" to satisfy regularization under condition. Now this is either regularized or not. If you assume not, and continue going for other cases of and regularizing in all other possible ways, you'll every time reach a case with no solutions for . Thus lets assume this is now regularized. Thus we need to solve: If you also look at the conditions under which this is regularized, you'll get: We have now solved case for -palindromes. That is, we have solutions: Or in the context of -palindromes: Now we need to check the expression in base and go over all regular expressions by going over combinations. After now checking these for conditions for base , you can show that the final solution to the for case is: Or in -palindrome context (the first part, the second part is just number in bases ): Now, in a similar way, you can handle the case, and find all -palindromes in bases . But when checking for as well, for base , there will be no final solutions for -palindromes. That is, for , we can show there aren't any solutions after doing a similar process for and then finally considering conditions as well. Thus, we can show the final solution for is: Which agrees with solutions given in claim. Generalizing the proof for claim? Is it possible to implement this process in a CAS? To solve for any given in general? I've tried in Mathematica , but I'm not sure how to properly go over   all regular expression. My idea was to go over all cases of permuting in . Now we can parameterize the base , and every digit in terms of and . Then, what is left, is to go over all regular expressions in each of these cases, and then solve just the system of equalities now. This will give all -palindromes. What is left then, is to apply the same process but now only for these -palindromes, and in base . We will be again solving just a system of equalities in every case, for every regular expression in that case. But I had trouble going over all regular expressions and of keeping track of that make sense to consider (Not all need to be considered, depending on the sizes and conditions so far on ), and also getting duplicate solutions for -palindromes in supposedly different regularized expressions. And on top of that, it was running extremely slowly to find the next set of -palindrome solutions for . So I'm not sure how to implement this process properly, or if it can actually work for a general case of in current CAS that are avaliable? Generalized system and related problems This system of inequalities and palindromic equalities , is related to the a bit more general similar system - where there can be more expressions instead of exactly such expressions. The general problem The generalized inequalities also allows for , where then they are just given as: And if is the smallest such for which is not zero, and if is the smallest such for which is not zero, then the system we are solving changes to: Such that the equalities stay palindromic. And now these along with given , actually represent equations for digits of a number in number bases , which are required to be palindromic in all of those three number  bases, which is the context this system was found in. Find all numbers palindromic in three consecutive number bases? That have digits in number base . In the general problem , number of digits does not need to be equal in all number bases as implied by - just in the base , where could have more digits. If , that is, the problem-system in this post is given, then number of digits, is required to be equal in all bases and is exactly . Related problems Even thought related problems imply the generalized system , all infinite families of solutions that are known so far, are given by the problem-system, . Also note that in the related problems (of mine), it is considered instead of , and it is talked in context of palindromes themselves, as those posts predate this system and the approach. - Which is equivalent to in terms of solutions, but easier to work with in the terms of the problem-system.

84,The Hasse invariant at cuspidal elliptic curves in a generically ordinary family,The Hasse invariant at cuspidal elliptic curves in a generically ordinary family,,"For an elliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x) \in \mathbb F_q[x]$ is a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, it is known (from Silverman's book, say) that the curve is supersingular precisely when the coefficient of $x^{p-1}$ in $f(x)^\frac{p-1}{2}$ is $0$ . My question is about the behavior of this coefficient in families of curves. Consider the following families of elliptic curves in characteristic $p>3$ . $E_1:y^2 = f_1(x,t) =  x(x-1)(x-t)$ and $E_2:y^2 = f_2(x,t) = x^3+3tx^2+3x+1$ where we can think of $t$ as an element of $\overline{\mathbb F}_q[t]$ . We can plug in any value $\alpha$ from $\overline {\mathbb F}_q$ for $t$ and so long $f_i(x,\alpha)$ doesn't obtain roots with multiplicity $>1$ , we still get an elliptic curve. The key difference between the above two families is that the former has node at $t=0,1$ and the latter has a cusp singularity at $t=1$ . Now I want to study the $x^{p-1}$ coefficient of $f_i(x,t)^{\frac{p-1}{2}}$ as an element of $\overline{\mathbb F}_q[t]$ . Let us call it $H_i(t)$ . Now, by doing some experiments in Sage (you can play around with these equations in the link) , I have seen that $H_1(t)$ does not vanish at $t=0,1$ (and can prove it using an old argument of Igusa) but $H_2(t)$ does seem to vanish at $t=1$ with a very large and predictable multiplicity: $\frac{p-1}{6}$ if $p\equiv 1 \pmod 6$ and $\frac{p+1}{6}$ if $p\equiv 5 \pmod 6$ . My question is why does this happen? So I've managed to tweak the equation of $E_2$ a bit so that the curve retains it's cusp but makes bookkeeping easier and have found a combinatorial proof of this high order vanishing. But I am looking for something more geometric that explains it. Somehow the polynomial vanishes on $\mathbb G_a$ but not on $\mathbb G_m$ ? This feels very much like the mod- $p$ modular form that goes by the name of the Hasse invariant or at least it's pullback under the map to the moduli space of elliptic curves. Is $\mathbb G_a$ ""very supersingular"" while $\mathbb G_m$ is ""ordinary"" under a suitable interpretation? Can someone give an explanation or direct me to a book/paper on what is going on and what the relationship of this polynomial is to the different types of singularities? NB: This phenomenon is clearly not unique to Elliptic Curves: Even for some higher genus cases, I see very similar patterns happening: If there are cusps or higher order singularities for a curve in a family of curves $C_t$ at a point $a$ , this large order of vanishing at $a$ is happening for an appropriate analog of the coefficient studied above.","For an elliptic curve of the form where is a cubic polynomial with distinct roots, it is known (from Silverman's book, say) that the curve is supersingular precisely when the coefficient of in is .
