11,Gluing diagrams: is it possible to glue a surface with itself in the same point? how is the diagram drawn?,Gluing diagrams: is it possible to glue a surface with itself in the same point? how is the diagram drawn?,,"I am learning the basic concepts of Topology, and playing now with the gluing diagrams (describing the fundamental domain of a topological space), this is an excerpt of a basic description I took from this page . ""In a gluing diagram, arrows or other markings are used show where a surface should be connected up with itself. A square without markings is just a square. It has boundaries in all directions. Now if we connect the left side to the right side, then a flatlander living in this space could go out the right side and come back in on the left. In fact, the flatlander could travel for ever in that direction without coming to a boundary. The top and bottom are still boundaries, though, so the flatlander couldn't travel far in either of those directions. "" These are samples of some basic configurations (left-right, up-down hope to be correct: cylinder, square, Möbius strip, torus, Klein bottle , and the real projective plane ) and my question is below them: The question I would like to ask is: Is it possible to glue the surface with itself in the same point, like if it was an angle of reflection of a mirror? so if the flatlander goes through one of those points which are glued to themselves, the flatlander will appear gradually exactly in the same place but in the bouncing direction of the angle of reflection? If that is possible, how is the gluing diagram drawn?

""In a gluing diagram, arrows or other markings are used show where a surface should be connected up with itself. A square without markings is just a square. It has boundaries in all directions. Now if we connect the left side to the right side, then a flatlander living in this space could go out the right side and come back in on the left. In fact, the flatlander could travel for ever in that direction without coming to a boundary. The top and bottom are still boundaries, though, so the flatlander couldn't travel far in either of those directions. "" These are samples of some basic configurations (left-right, up-down hope to be correct: cylinder, square, Möbius strip, torus, Klein bottle , and the real projective plane ) and my question is below them: The question I would like to ask is: Is it possible to glue the surface with itself in the same point, like if it was an angle of reflection of a mirror? so if the flatlander goes through one of those points which are glued to themselves, the flatlander will appear gradually exactly in the same place but in the bouncing direction of the angle of reflection? If that is possible, how is the gluing diagram drawn?

24,An arbitrary product of connected spaces is connected,An arbitrary product of connected spaces is connected,,"Let $\lbrace X_\alpha \rbrace_{\alpha \in J}$ be an indexed family of connected spaces; let $X$ be the product space $$X=\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$$ Let a $=(a_\alpha)$ be a fixed point of $X$ . Given any finite subset $K$ of $J$ , let $X_K$ denote the subspace of $X$ consisting of all points x $=(x_\alpha)$ such that $x_\alpha=a_\alpha$ for $\alpha \notin K$ . Show that $X_K$ is connected. As the title suggests, this is part 1 of 3 to show that $X$ is connected (found in Munkres' Topology, second edition, p. 152). The other parts look fairly straightforward, but this one has been a little tricky for me; the main problem is that $J$ might be uncountable, which makes traditional index notation unusable. My approach so far has been to show that $X_K$ is homeomorphic to a finite sub-product of $X$ . If $|K|=n$ (which is known to be finite), then let $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n$ be the $n$ indices for which x and a differ. Also let $$Z=\prod_{m=\alpha_1}^{\alpha_n} X_m$$ I suspect that $X_K$ is homeomorphic to $Z$ . The most natural map would be $f: X_K \rightarrow Z$ defined by, for x $\in X_K$ , ""stripping off"" all coordinates of x which disagree with a , leaving only finitely many.

Let $f_n \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a sequence of continuous functions such that $f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that, for each $x \in X$ , the sequence $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ as $n \to \infty$ . Then the sequence $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $X$ . This is problem 10 (a), Sec. 26, in the book Topplogy by James R. Munkres, 2nd edition. I've managed to give a proof of this result. However, what if we require that $f_n(x) \geq f_{n+1}(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ? My assertion is the convergence is still uniform. Here's my proposed proof: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Let $x \in X$ . Since $f_n(x) \to f(x)$ as $n \to \infty$ , there exists $N(x) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\vert f_n(x) - f(x) \vert < \epsilon$ if $n \geq N(x)$ . Since $f_n(x)$ is a monotically decreasing sequence, we must have $f_n(x) \geq f(x)$ for all $n$ . So $$\vert f_n(x) - f(x) \vert = f_n(x) - f(x) < \epsilon \ \ \ \mbox{ if } \ n \geq N(x). $$ In particular, $$f_{N(x)} (x) - f(x) < \epsilon.$$ Since $f_{N(x)} - f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, the set $$U_x \colon= \left( f_{N(x)} - f \right)^{-1} \left( \ (-\infty, \epsilon) \ \right)$$ is open in $X$ and the point $x$ belongs to $U_x$ . In this way, we have an open covering $\{ U_x \colon x \in X \}$ of $X$ . Since $X$ is compact, there is a finite subcollection $U_{x_1}, \ldots, U_{x_k}$ that also covers $x$ . Let $N \colon= \max \left( N(x_1), \ldots, N(x_k) \right)$ . Let $y \in X$ . Then $y \in U_{x_i}$ for some $i = 1, \ldots, k$ . So, $$f_{N(x_i)} (y) - f(y) < \epsilon. $$ So, if $n \geq N$ , then we have $$ \begin{align*} \vert f_n(y) - f(y) \vert &= f_n(y) - f(y) \\ &\leq f_N(y) - f(y) \\ &\leq f_{N(x_i)} (y) - f(y) \\  &< \epsilon.  \end{align*} $$ Thus, for every given $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists a natural number $N$ such that, if $n \geq N$ , then we have $$\vert f_n(y) - f(y) \vert < \epsilon$$ for all $y \in X$ . Hence $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ on $X$ . Is the above proof correct? But the result breaks down in the following example. Let $X \colon= [0,1]$ , and, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ,  let $f_n \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $$f_n(x) \colon= x^n \ \ \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in X.$$ Now, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , $$f_n(0) = 0 = f_{n+1}(0),$$ and $$f_n(1) = 1 = f_{n+1}(1);$$ for $x \in (0,1)$ , we have $$f_n(x) = x^n > x^{n+1} = f_{n+1}(x).$$ The sequence $f_n$ converges pointwise to the function $f \colon X \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $$ f(x) \colon=  \begin{align*} 0 & \ \mbox{ if } \ 0 \leq x < 1; \\ 1 & \ \mbox{ if } \ x = 1.  \end{align*} $$ but this convergence is not uniform.

51,"There is no homeomorphic copy of $[0,1]$ in the plane which contains an open ball",There is no homeomorphic copy of  in the plane which contains an open ball,"[0,1]","Problem: Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ be homeomorphic to the interval $[0,1]$.  Then $A$ contains no nonempty open set of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. What I've got so far: if it does, then it contains an open ball, say $O$.  Since $[0,1]$ is compact and path connected, so is $A$, and in particular $A$ is closed.  Thus $\overline{O} \subseteq \overline{A} = A$, meaning $A \setminus O$ contains the boundary of $O$. I think that $A \setminus O$ should be path connected; if $x, y \in A \setminus O$, we already know there is a path $\tau$ in $A$ which goes from $x$ to $y$.  If this path doesn't go through $O$, no problem; if it does, by compactness (somehow) we should be able to find an interval $(c,d) \subseteq [0,1]$ for which $\tau(c), \tau(d) \in \overline{O}$ and $\tau(t) \in O$ only for values of $t \in (c,d)$.

Then $A$ contains no nonempty open set of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. What I've got so far: if it does, then it contains an open ball, say $O$.  Since $[0,1]$ is compact and path connected, so is $A$, and in particular $A$ is closed.  Thus $\overline{O} \subseteq \overline{A} = A$, meaning $A \setminus O$ contains the boundary of $O$.

I'm trying to prove that any subset of a noetherian topological space is noetherian in its induced topology. MY ATTEMPT OF SOLUTION Let $X$ be a topological space and $Y$ a subspace of $X$. If $F=\{U_i\cap Y\}$ is a family of open subsets of $Y$, where the $U_i$ are open subsets of $X$, can I say that $M\cap Y$ is a maximal element of $F$, where $M$ is a maximal element of the $U_i$'s?
