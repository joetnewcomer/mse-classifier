7,Proof of Divergence Criterion for Functional Limits,Proof of Divergence Criterion for Functional Limits,,"I'm self-studying from the book Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott, and I don't understand corollary 4.2.5 on page 107. To be more specific, let me first write down the theorem that precedes the corollary: (Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits) : Let $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$ and let $c$ be a limit point of $A$. Then $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ if, and only if, for all $(x_n) \subseteq A$ satisfying $x_n \neq c$ and $(x_n) \to c$, it follows that $f(x_n) \to L$. Now, the corollary is as follows: (Divergence Criterion for Functional Limits) : Let $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$, and let $c$ be a limit point of $A$. If there exist two sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ in $A$ with $x_n \neq c$ and $y_n \neq c$, and: \begin{equation} \lim x_n = \lim y_n = c \;\;\; \text{but} \;\;\; \lim f(x_n) \neq \lim f(y_n) \end{equation} then we can conclude that the functional limit $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ does not exist. The author provides no proof of the corollary and since he normally proves all theorems or gives them as exercises, I get the impression that the corollary is supposed to be trivially true. But I don't get it. Namely, if we consider the sequence $(y_n)$ discussed in the corollary, then it satisfies $y_n \neq c$ and $(y_n) \to c$, and the limit of $f(y_n)$ may also exist (nowhere in the corollary is it stated that the limit of $f(y_n)$ does not exist). Thus, in case the limit of $f(y_n)$ does exist, say $f(y_n) \to L$, then it must be that $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, and so the limit does exist. Of course, following a similar argument, if we now consider the sequence $(x_n)$ mentioned in the corollary, then we must again have that $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ does exist. Combining the above two arguments, the only thing I can think of is that it is impossible to have $\lim f(x_n) \neq \lim f(y_n)$ if $\lim x_n = \lim y_n = c$.","I'm self-studying from the book Understanding Analysis by Stephen Abbott, and I don't understand corollary 4.2.5 on page 107.
