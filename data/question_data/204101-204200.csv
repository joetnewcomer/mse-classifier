1,Geodesics of Helicoid,Geodesics of Helicoid,,"I'm working on the geodesics of a helicoid $S$ parametrised by $X(u,v) = \left( u \cos(v) , u \sin(v) , v \right)$ , with $\alpha(t) = \left( u(t) , v(t) \right) : I \subset \mathbb{R} \to S$ a unit speed curve on $S$ , i.e. parametrised by arc length.

By computing the derivatives $E_u = E_v = F_u = F_v = G_v = 0$ and $G_u = 2u$ , we can compute the Christoffel symbols \begin{align} \Gamma_{11}^1 = \Gamma_{11}^2 = \Gamma_{12}^1 = \Gamma_{22}^2 = 0; \\ \Gamma_{12}^2 = \frac{u}{u^2+1}; \qquad \Gamma_{22}^1 = -u. \end{align} It is given that $\alpha$ is a geodesic on $S$ , which is equivalent to the satisfaction of the following system: \begin{align} u'' + \Gamma_{11}^1 \left( u'(t) \right)^2 + 2 \Gamma_{12}^1 u'(t) v'(t) + \Gamma_{22}^1 \left( v'(t) \right)^2 &= 0 \\ v'' + \Gamma_{11}^2 \left( u'(t) \right)^2 + 2 \Gamma_{12}^2 u'(t) v'(t) + \Gamma_{22}^2 \left( v'(t) \right)^2 &= 0 \\ \implies u'' - u \left( v'(t) \right)^2 &= 0 \\ v'' + 2 \frac{u}{u^2+1} u'(t) v'(t) &= 0  \end{align} The last equation yields by integration $v' = \Theta/ \left( u^2 +1 \right)$ , where $\Theta$ is an integration constant. If $\Theta = 0$ then $v'\equiv 0$ and subsequently $v = $ constant, i.e. it is a necessary condition that $u' \ne 0$ for $v = $ constant and $u = u(s)$ to be a geodesic. Is this correct?

6,Canonical Form for Commuting Vector Fields,Canonical Form for Commuting Vector Fields,,"I am reading Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by John M. Lee, and I have a question about the proof of a theorem about canonical form for commuting vector fields. The statement and the proof of the theorem (Theorem 9.46 in the book) goes as follows: Theorem . Let $M$ be a smooth $n$ -manifold, and let $(V_1,\dots,V_k)$ be a linearly independent $k$ -tuple of smooth commuting vector fields on an open subset $W\subseteq M$ . For each $p\in W$ , there exists a smooth coordinate chart $(U,(s_i))$ centered at $p$ such that $V_i=\partial/\partial s^i$ for $i=1,\dots ,k$ / If $S\subseteq W$ is an embedded codimension- $k$ submanifold and $p$ is a point of $S$ such that $T_p S$ is complementary to the span of $(V_1\mid _p,\dots V_k\mid _p)$ , then the coordinates can also be chosen such that $S\cap U$ is the slice defined by $s^1=\cdots=s^k=0$ . Proof. Choose a slice chart $(U,(x^i))$ for $S$ centered at $p$ , so that $U\cap S$ is equal to the slice $\{x\in U\mid x^1=\cdots =x_k=0\}$ . Because the theorem is local, it suffices to consider the case where $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . Let $\theta_i$ denote the flow of $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots, k$ , and choose $\varepsilon>0$ and a neighbrohood $Y$ of $p$ such that the composition $(\theta_1)_{t_1} \circ \cdots \circ(\theta_k)_{t_k}$ is defined on $Y$ and maps $Y$ into $U$ whenever $|t_1|,\dots |t_k|$ are all less than $\varepsilon$ . Define $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ by $$\Omega=\{(s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)|(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots,s^n)\in Y\},$$ and define $\Phi:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon)^k\times \Omega\to U$ by $$\Phi(s^1,\dots s^n)=(\theta_1)_{s^1} \circ \cdots \circ(\theta_k)_{s^k}(0,\dots,0,s^{k+1},\dots ,s^n).$$ The hypothesis that $\theta_i$ commutes ensures us that $\partial/\partial s^i$ is $\Phi$ -related to $V_i$ for $i=1,\dots ,k$ . By construction, we also have $d\Phi_0(\partial/\partial s^i|_0)=\partial/\partial x^i \mid _p$ for $i=k+1,\dots, n$ ; it follows that the differential $d\Phi _0$ of $\Phi$ at the origin is invertible, so $\Phi$ restricts a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $0$ onto an open set $\tilde U$ of $M$ . The chart $(\tilde U,\varphi):=(\tilde U, \Phi^{-1})$ is the desired slice chart for $S$ . $\square$ I do not understand why the chart $(\tilde U,\varphi)$ a slice chart for $S$ . For sure, by construction we have $\Phi (\{0\}\times \Omega)=S\cap Y$ , so if $q\in \tilde U$ satisfies $\varphi(q)\in \{0\}\times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ , then $q$ has to lie in $S$ . However, (if my understanding is correct) the construction above does not exclude the possibility that $\varphi(\tilde U\cap S)\supsetneq \varphi(\tilde U)\cap (\{0\}\times \mathbb{R}^{n-k})$ .

In particular, Spin $\left( 7\right) $ acts canonically on the Grassmannian $G\left( 3,8\right) $ of oriented 3-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^{8}=\mathbb{O}$ . We would like to know the isotropy subgroup $K$ of this action at $1\wedge i\wedge j$ . What we know: Theorem 9.3 in [SW] asserts that Spin $\left( 7\right) $ acts transitively on \begin{equation*} \{(u,v,w,x)\in \mathbb{R}^{8}\mid u,v,w,X(u,v,w),x\text{ are orthonormal}\}% \text{.} \end{equation*} This implies the following: The action of Spin $\left( 7\right) $ on $G\left( 3,8\right) $ is transitive and so the dimension of $K$ must be $6$ .

Let $(M,g)$ be a Lorentzian manifold. Let $\phi : \Sigma\to M$ be one null hypersurface, by which we mean its normal is null. It is common in GR to argue the following: Since the normal vector $\zeta$ to $\Sigma$ is null, it is orthogonal to itself. Hence the normal to $\Sigma$ also lives in its tangent bundle. In that case, one can consider its integral lines. One works formally to show that $\zeta$ satisfies the autoparallel equation $$\zeta^\mu \nabla_\mu\zeta_\nu=\alpha\zeta_\nu.$$ Now, I have one problem here. It seems intuitively clear to me that being a geodesic on a submanifold is not the same as being a geodesic on the ambient space. One example that comes to my mind is in $\mathbb{R}^3$ .

I would like to compute the euler characteristic of sphere bundle concretely. I have figured out the following so far. Let $S^k$ be the $k-$ sphere. Consider vector field $v$ starting from south pole to north pole by flowing. Clearly this gives a section to $T(S^k)$ . Now normalize this section by considering any riemannian metric $||\cdot||$ by $\frac{v}{||v||}$ and this gives a section on sphere bundle of $S^k$ with fiber $S^{k-1}$ away from 2 points(i.e. south and north pole). Since Euler number can be computed by sum of local degrees at south pole and north pole, I can compute the local degree at local trivializations of sphere bundle at south pole $a$ and north pole $b$ . WLOG, one can assume local trivializations look like $D(x)\times S^{k-1}$ where $D(x)$ is some open disk on sphere $S^k$ centered at $x$ . Then consider the following maps. $\partial D(x)\xrightarrow{s}D(x)\times S^{k-1}\xrightarrow{\pi_2} S^{k-1}$ and denote total map as $f_x$ . Pick volume form $\omega$ on $S^{k-1}$ where $\omega$ can be standard volume form.

This follows from $f_x^\star$ defines form restricts cohomology generator on each fiber and thus same cohomology class as global angular form. Hence they differ by a total differential and then one can apply stoke theorem to see the integral agrees.(Here I have already assumed the support of $\psi$ is away from $D(x)$ and one can shrink the size of disk if necessary.)

Therefore, the differential is $$l_{\{*,I\}}: T_I(G) \to T_A(G)$$ Is the differential $l_{*,I}$ of $l$ , left multiplication by $A$ , still left multiplication by $A$ ? I think it is, and here is what I've tried: Let $X_I \in T_I(G)$ . We must show $l_{*,I}(X_I)(f) = AX_I(f)$ for all $f \in C^{\infty}_I(G)$ . (Strictly, $f: U \to \mathbb R$ is a smooth function for some $U$ containing $I$ and open in $G$ while the members of $C^{\infty}_I(G)$ are equivalence classes. I think the $C^{\infty}_I(G)$ here is treated as a collection of the representatives of the equivalence classes). First, there exists a smooth a curve $s:(-\varepsilon,\varepsilon) \to G$ that starts at $I$ and whose velocity vector is $X_I$ for some $\varepsilon > 0$ . This means $s(0)=I$ and for each $f$ , we have $$X_I(f) = s'(0)(f) := s_{*,0}[\frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f] := \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(s(t))$$ Then, for each $f$ , $$l_{*,I}(X_I f) = \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(l(s(t)))$$ Now, $s(t)$ is a matrix for every $t$ , so $l(s(t))=As(t)$ . Therefore, the left hand side is: $$l_{*,I}(X_I f) = \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(As(t))$$ For the right hand side, $$AX_I(f) = As'(0)(f) = A s_{*,0}[\frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f] = A \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(s(t))$$ By linearity of $X_I$ , $AX_I(f) = X_I(Af)$ . Hence, $$A \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(s(t)) = AX_I(f) = X_I(Af) = s'(0)(Af) =  s_{*,0}[\frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 Af] = \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 Af(s(t))$$ Therefore, the right hand side is $$AX_I(f) = A \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 f(s(t)) = \frac{d}{dt} \mid_0 Af(s(t))$$ If $Af(s(t)) = f(As(t))$ , then why?

50,Choice of volume forms in the Weyl Integration Formula,Choice of volume forms in the Weyl Integration Formula,,"The following proof is adapted from Bump's Lie Groups . I've tried to rewrite the parts I find unclear. However, I seem to end up with a discrepancy. Please help me complete the proof or point out any mistakes. Theorem: Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group, and $T$ be a maximal torus. Let $f$ be a function constant on conjugacy classes of $G$ . Give $G$ and $T$ normalized Haar measures, and write $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{p} \oplus \mathfrak{t}$ where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the orthogonal complement of $\mathfrak{t}$ for some choice of invariant inner product. Then $$\int_G fdg= \frac{1}{|W|}\int_{T}f(t)\det\left(Ad(t^{-1})|_{\mathfrak{p}}-I_{\mathfrak{p}}\right)dt$$ where $W=N(T)/T$ , the Weyl group. Proof: Let $\omega$ , $\beta$ be left-invariant top forms on $G$ , $T$ respectively which integrate to give $1$ . These then give the Haar measures on $G$ , $T$ . These forms are also right-invariant since both $G$ and $T$ are compact. Let $d=\dim(G/T)$ . We can also construct a left-invariant top form $\alpha$ on $G/T$ as follows: Choose bases $\lbrace A_i \rbrace$ and $\lbrace B_i \rbrace$ of $\mathfrak{p}$ and $\mathfrak{t}$ respectively such that $\beta_e(\wedge B_i)=1, \omega_e(\wedge A_i \bigwedge \wedge B_i)=1$ . Identifying $\bigwedge^{d} T_{eT}(G/T) = \bigwedge^d \mathfrak{p}$ , define $\alpha_{eT}(\wedge A_i) = 1$ . We then extend $\alpha_{eT}$ to a differentiable section by setting $\alpha_{xT}\left(\wedge V_i \right) = \alpha_{eT}(\bigwedge dl_{x^{-1}}V_i)$ . Here $V_i$ are tangent vectors at $xT$ and $dl_x$ is the differential of left translation. It remains to check $\alpha$ is well defined and smooth. If $x_1T = x_2T$ , then we would have $x_2 = x_1t$ for some $t \in T$ . so $dl_{x_2^{-1}} = dl_{t^{-1}} \circ dl_{x_1^{-1}}$ . Thus it suffices to show $\bigwedge dl_t (A_i)= \wedge A_i$ . This follows since we may compute $dl_t = Ad(t)|_\mathfrak{p} \in Aut(\mathfrak{p})$ and since $\det\left( Ad(t)|_{\mathfrak{p}}\right)=1$ . $\alpha$ is smooth since the left action of $G$ on $G/T$ is smooth. Thus $\alpha$ is a non-zero, left-invariant, top form and gives us a left invariant measure on $G/T$ . Note, I am aware that left-invariant measures can be constructed using the Riesz representation theorem however, since I intend to use the jacobian change of variables formula, it seems necessary to show that these measures are induced by differential forms. Define $\phi: G/T \times T \to G, \phi(xT,t)=xtx^{-1}$ . We now compute the pullback $\phi^*\omega$ in terms of $\alpha \wedge \beta$ as follows: Fix $(xT,t) \in G/T \times T$ . Identify $\mathfrak{p}\oplus \mathfrak{t}$ with $T_{(xT,t)}\left(G/T\times T\right)$ by $A_i \mapsto \frac{d}{ds}(xe^{sA_i}T,t)$ and $B_i \mapsto \frac{d}{ds}(xT,te^{sB_i})$ . Since $\phi(xe^{sA_i}T,t)=xe^{sA_i}te^{-sA_i}x^{-1} = xt(t^{-1}s^{sA_i}t)e^{-sA_i}x^{-1}$ and $\phi(xT,te^{sB_i})= xte^{sB_i}x^{-1}$ , we see that the differential of $\phi$ is given as in the following commutative diagram: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD} T_{(eT,e)}(G/T\times T)=\mathfrak{p}\oplus \mathfrak{t} @>{(Ad(t^{-1})-I)\oplus I}>> \mathfrak{p}\oplus \mathfrak{t}=T_e(G)\\ @VVV @V{dl_{xt}\circ dr_x^{-1}}VV \\ T_{(xT,t)}\left(G/T\times T\right) @>{d\phi}>> T_{xtx^{-1}}(G) \end{CD} Taking exterior powers we get, \begin{CD} \wedge \mathfrak{p}\otimes \wedge\mathfrak{t} @>{\det\left(Ad(t^{-1})-I\right)}>> \wedge \mathfrak{p}\otimes \wedge\mathfrak{t}=\wedge T_e(G)\\ @VVV @V{\wedge (dl_{xt}\circ dr_x^{-1})}VV \\ \wedge T_{(xT,t)}\left(G/T\times T\right) @>{J\phi}>> \wedge T_{xtx^{-1}}(G) \end{CD} After dualizing the above diagram, we see that since $\omega$ is bi-invariant, $\omega_{xtx^{-1}}$ pulls back vertically to $\omega_e$ . Since $(\alpha\wedge\beta)_{(eT,e)}(\wedge A_i \otimes \wedge B_i)= \omega_e(\wedge A_i \bigwedge \wedge B_i)=1$ , we see that $\omega_e$ pulls back along the top arrow to $\det\left(Ad(t^{-1})|_{\mathfrak{p}}-I_{\mathfrak{p}}\right)(\alpha\wedge\beta)_{(eT,e)}$ . By the left invariance of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , we see that $(\alpha \wedge \beta)_{(xT,t)}$ pulls back along the left vertical arrow to $(\alpha\wedge\beta)_{(eT,e)}$ . The commutativity of the above diagram thus shows $\phi^*\omega=\det\left(Ad(t^{-1})|_{\mathfrak{p}}-I_{\mathfrak{p}}\right)(\alpha\wedge\beta)$ .

Theorem: Let be a compact connected Lie group, and be a maximal torus. Let be a function constant on conjugacy classes of . Give and normalized Haar measures, and write where is the orthogonal complement of for some choice of invariant inner product. Then where , the Weyl group. Proof: Let , be left-invariant top forms on , respectively which integrate to give . These then give the Haar measures on , . These forms are also right-invariant since both and are compact. Let . We can also construct a left-invariant top form on as follows: Choose bases and of and respectively such that . Identifying , define . We then extend to a differentiable section by setting . Here are tangent vectors at and is the differential of left translation. It remains to check is well defined and smooth. If , then we would have for some . so . Thus it suffices to show . This follows since we may compute and since . is smooth since the left action of on is smooth. Thus is a non-zero, left-invariant, top form and gives us a left invariant measure on . Note, I am aware that left-invariant measures can be constructed using the Riesz representation theorem however, since I intend to use the jacobian change of variables formula, it seems necessary to show that these measures are induced by differential forms. Define . We now compute the pullback in terms of as follows: Fix . Identify with by and .

Here what is being minimized by the curve is the $1$ -dim measure of the $1$ -dim object in the $2$ -dim space that joins the two given $0$ -dim objects. In $3$ -dim Euclidean space, what is the minimal surface that connects (and necessarily contains) two given straight line segments (of known finite length)? Again, here what is being minimized is the surface area ( $2$ -dim measure) of the $2$ -dim object (embedded in $3$ -dim space) connecting two given $1$ -dim objects. Is there an umbrella name for this whole category? By ""the whole category"" I mean given line segments can be in general configurations and not just special cases like being parallel, or the two segments having the same length. (btw the special case of parallel and same length seems to yield helicoid as the minimal surface) As pointed out by Rahul in the comment, besides the given two straight line segments, it is necessary that one specifies the ""other"" boundaries. For simplicity, a reasonable choice seems to be connecting the end points to have a non-planar (skew) quadrilateral frame (for the soap film, so to speak). Note: This post seems relevant, but it doesn't solve my problem (of finding the keywords). I suspect this should be one of the basic stuff in differential geometry that everybody knows or agrees on (just like how people agree on the notion of a straight line). The next section describes my current guesswork, and it would be nice to know if I'm on the right track. My Naive Guess: the unique ruled surface Given two straight line segments in the $3$ -dim space, it suffice to consider the two skew lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ that contain them respectively. As one can parametrize a segment as part of an infinite line, the desired minimal surface from the given segments is part of the surface ""generated"" by $L_1$ and $L_2$ . One can find the unique pair of points, $P_1$ on $L_1$ and $P_2$ on $L_2$ , that have the smallest distance. Accordingly one obtains $\overset{\longrightarrow}{P_1P_2}$ as the common normal vector between for two skew lines. Now one can define a ruled surface by parametrizing the ""moving"" lines $L(t)$ , thus making a ruled surface, with parameter $t$ : starting with $L(t) = L_1$ at $t = 0$ , ""move"" $L(t)$ towards $L_2$ along $\overset{\longrightarrow}{P_1P_2}$ , ""anchoring"" at $P_1$ and rotate $L(t)$ along the way to make it eventually coincide with $L_2$ . The surface is not yet unique before specifying the amount of rotation (with respect to the distance to $L_2$ ). I'm guessing the rotation should be done linearly, but I haven't figure out if this indeed minimizes the surface area. Obviously a standard approach is to formulate the whole thing in terms of calculus of variations. I've done the almost trivial case of a straight line minimizing the distance, but apparently things get very complicated already for a $2$ -dim surface in $3$ -dim. Even in the special cases where the coordinates are setup nicely so that the surface is a function like $z = f(x,y)$ , it's an elliptic PDE and the solution seems to vary greatly depending on the boundary conditions. In short, I don't know how to handle the situation.","In the -dim Euclidean plane, the minimal curve that joins (and necessarily contains) two given points is a straight line.

67,What does it really mean for a Lagrangian to be independent of the base coordinates?,What does it really mean for a Lagrangian to be independent of the base coordinates?,,"In this question I will be considering what is called in physics a ""classical Lagrangian field theory"" from a geometric point of view. One is given an $n$ dimensional (smooth, real) ""spacetime manifold"" $M$ , with some ""field"" $\psi$ on it. From a purely local point of view, the field is assumed to have components $\psi^i(x)$ . A (first-order) Lagrangian is then an $n$ -form $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n $$ that depends on the field, the field derivatives and maybe on the spacetime coordinates explicitly. In physics, it is considered pathological for a Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the spacetime coordinates. Usually it signals a ""nonclosed"" system, where there are externally imposed fields, whose dynamics are not controlled by a Lagrangian. From a more precise point of view, let $E\rightarrow M$ be a rank $k$ vector bundle over $M$ (it can be a general fiber bundle, and in fact, it is often not a vector bundle, but even in those cases, one can often consider it a vector bundle - for example the bundle of metrics, which is nonlinear may be enlarged to the bundle of symmetric (0,2) tensors, which is). The field $\psi$ is considered a section of $E$ . In a local trivialization $E$ has coordinates $(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\})$ . We can consider the first jet bundle $J^1E$ of (sections of) $E$ , whose local coordinates are $(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\})$ . If $\psi$ is a section of $E$ , it ""looks like"" in local coordinates as $$\psi: x\mapsto (\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\}), $$ and its first jet prolongation $j^1\psi$ looks like as $$ j^1\psi:x\mapsto (\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\}).$$ The (first-order) Lagrangian is then a horizontal $n$ -form on $J^1E$ , which in a local trivialization looks like as $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n $$ where the $dx^\mu$ are considered 1-forms on $J^1E$ . The fields are not involved here, however, the action functional is defined as $$ S[\psi]=\int (j^1\psi)^\ast\hat L, $$ where $$(j^1\psi)^*\hat L=\mathcal L(\{x^\mu\},\{\psi^i(x)\},\{\partial_\mu\psi^i(x)\})dx^1\wedge...\wedge dx^n.$$ The problem: It is a well known fact that if $E\rightarrow M$ is some fiber bundle (like the $E$ previously defined, or $J^1E$ ), then if $f:E\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is some smooth function (the target space of this map is not really relevant), and in some local trivialization this function looks like as $$ f(\{y^i\}), $$ eg. $f$ doesn't depend on the base coordinates $x^\mu$ , then this is not a trivialization-independent statement. In some other trivialization, it will look like as $$ f^\prime(\{x^{\prime\mu}\},\{y^{\prime i}\}). $$ On the other hand, as I have stated in the beginning of the question, in physics it is considered pathological to have a Lagrangian that depends explicitly on $x^\mu$ . However by the previous argument, it should not be possible to construct a Lagrangian on $J^1E$ , that looks like $$ \hat L=\mathcal L(\{y^i\},\{y^i_\mu\}) $$ in all trivializations. Now, I know that in physics, there is often a lot of background structure assumed. These background structures can break ""general covariance"". I can illustrate this with the following example: For the massless Klein-Gordon field in Minkowski-spacetime, the Lagrangian (in physics language - so this is already pulled back via the field's prolongation) is $$ \mathcal L=\frac{1}{2}\eta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\psi\partial_\nu\psi\ dx^1\wedge...dx^n, $$ where $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ is the canonical ""flat"" form of the dual Lorentz-metric. It is not explicitly $x$ -dependent, but this is not a trivialization-independent statement. If we perform a non-Poincaré coordinate transformation, the Lagrangian will look like $$ \mathcal L=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}(x)\partial_\mu\psi\partial_\nu\psi\sqrt{|\det g(x)|}dx^1\wedge...dx^n. $$ Here the general form of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ is $x$ -dependent, but is an externally imposed field, so the Lagrangian is $x$ -dependent. However, in physics, if we account for everything, then we can get rid of all background structures. For example, we can consider the gravitational field (the metric) $g$ , a matter field $\psi$ (a Dirac field, or a scalar multiplet), and a gauge connection $A$ , and mesh everything into a glorious Lagrangian $$ \mathcal L(\psi,\partial\psi,A,\partial A,g,\partial g,\partial\partial g) $$ (this Lagrangian will be second order in $g$ , but that doesn't change the problem). Now, this Lagrangian will never acquire explicit $x$ -dependence, through either diffeomorphisms of $M$ , or changes of trivialization in $E$ (here $\psi$ is a section of $E$ , and $E$ is considered a $G$ -bundle for some Lie group $G$ , and $A$ is a $G$ -connection) or for that matter, in the ""connection bundle"" in which $A$ lives. So from this, it seems to me that if we use fiber products to create one massive fiber bundle $\mathcal E$ from all these bundles involved, then the unified Lagrangian is still a horizontal element in $\Omega^n(J^1\mathcal E)$ , yet it will never acquire explicit $x$ -dependence. Question: Considering all the lengthy exposition I have given above, how do you invariantly and geometrically characterize Lagrangians which do not depend explicitly on the base manifold's coordinates? Since this should be a trivialization-dependent statement, yet it also seems to be that it is possible to construct Lagrangians that absolutely do not depend on any background structures, and are as such $x$ -independent.","In this question I will be considering what is called in physics a ""classical Lagrangian field theory"" from a geometric point of view. One is given an dimensional (smooth, real) ""spacetime manifold"" , with some ""field"" on it. From a purely local point of view, the field is assumed to have components . A (first-order) Lagrangian is then an -form that depends on the field, the field derivatives and maybe on the spacetime coordinates explicitly. In physics, it is considered pathological for a Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the spacetime coordinates. Usually it signals a ""nonclosed"" system, where there are externally imposed fields, whose dynamics are not controlled by a Lagrangian. From a more precise point of view, let be a rank vector bundle over (it can be a general fiber bundle, and in fact, it is often not a vector bundle, but even in those cases, one can often consider it a vector bundle - for example the bundle of metrics, which is nonlinear may be enlarged to the bundle of symmetric (0,2) tensors, which is). The field is considered a section of . In a local trivialization has coordinates . We can consider the first jet bundle of (sections of) , whose local coordinates are . If is a section of , it ""looks like"" in local coordinates as and its first jet prolongation looks like as The (first-order) Lagrangian is then a horizontal -form on , which in a local trivialization looks like as where the are considered 1-forms on . The fields are not involved here, however, the action functional is defined as where The problem: It is a well known fact that if is some fiber bundle (like the previously defined, or ), then if is some smooth function (the target space of this map is not really relevant), and in some local trivialization this function looks like as eg. doesn't depend on the base coordinates , then this is not a trivialization-independent statement. In some other trivialization, it will look like as On the other hand, as I have stated in the beginning of the question, in physics it is considered pathological to have a Lagrangian that depends explicitly on . However by the previous argument, it should not be possible to construct a Lagrangian on , that looks like in all trivializations. Now, I know that in physics, there is often a lot of background structure assumed. These background structures can break ""general covariance"". I can illustrate this with the following example: For the massless Klein-Gordon field in Minkowski-spacetime, the Lagrangian (in physics language - so this is already pulled back via the field's prolongation) is where is the canonical ""flat"" form of the dual Lorentz-metric. It is not explicitly -dependent, but this is not a trivialization-independent statement. If we perform a non-Poincaré coordinate transformation, the Lagrangian will look like Here the general form of the metric is -dependent, but is an externally imposed field, so the Lagrangian is -dependent. However, in physics, if we account for everything, then we can get rid of all background structures. For example, we can consider the gravitational field (the metric) , a matter field (a Dirac field, or a scalar multiplet), and a gauge connection , and mesh everything into a glorious Lagrangian (this Lagrangian will be second order in , but that doesn't change the problem). Now, this Lagrangian will never acquire explicit -dependence, through either diffeomorphisms of , or changes of trivialization in (here is a section of , and is considered a -bundle for some Lie group , and is a -connection) or for that matter, in the ""connection bundle"" in which lives. So from this, it seems to me that if we use fiber products to create one massive fiber bundle from all these bundles involved, then the unified Lagrangian is still a horizontal element in , yet it will never acquire explicit -dependence.

By the exactness of (4.7) (attached at last), we know $\delta(H^1(X,\mathcal{O}^*))=ker(H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})\to H^1(X,\mathcal{O}))$, but the image of $H^2_{1,1}(X,\mathbb{Z})$ in $H^1(X,\mathcal{O})$ is zero only shows $H^2_{1,1}(X,\mathbb{Z})\subset ker(H^2(X,\mathbb{Z})\to H^1(X,\mathcal{O}))$, I wonder why it proves that $\delta(H^1(X,\mathcal{O}^*))=H^2_{1,1}(X,\mathbb{Z})$?",,"['differential-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'sheaf-cohomology']"
99,Range of Lifted Differential Operators,Range of Lifted Differential Operators,,"Let $D:C^\infty M \rightarrow C^\infty M$ a differential operator on a Riemannian manifold $M$. Define its maximal extension as closed operator $$D_\max:L^2M\supset \mathrm{dom}(D_\max):=\{u\in L^2M\vert Du\in L^2M\} \rightarrow L^2M, u \mapsto Du$$ Further suppose that $p\colon\hat M\rightarrow M$ is a finite-sheeted Riemannian covering and that $\hat D$ is the lift of $D$, i.e. $\hat Dp^*u=p^*Du$ for $u\in C^\infty M$. Similar to above define $\hat D_\max$ as closed operator in $L^2 \hat M$. Question : If $D_\max$ has closed range, does also $\hat D_\max$ have closed range? Below are some thoughts and proof attempts: Examples and alternative Characterization : If $M$ is compact, then closedness of range is often trivial. Let's look at some non-compact examples. We use the following characterization: ""A closed operator $A$ has closed range iff there is an ""Poincaré-inequality"" of the form $\Vert A u \Vert_{L^2} \ge C \Vert u - Qu\Vert_{L^2}$, where $Q\in \mathcal{B}(L^2M)$ is the orthogonal projection onto $\ker A$. "" E.g. if $M$ is a bounded open subset of euclidean space (with $\partial \bar M$  not too terrible) and $D= \nabla$, then the Poincaré-Wirtinger inequality tells us that $D_\max$ has closed range. However, if $M=\mathbb{R}^n$ then $\nabla$ does not have closed range. These two examples show that the closed range assumption is really a global condition, which makes it harder to deal with covering spaces. Also it suggests that $p$ better be finite-sheeted, otherwise we might for example run into trouble when lifting an operator from the torus to the euclidean plane. Lifting the property for invariant functions: Let $H_0\subset L^2\hat M$ be the subspace of functions which are invariant under the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(p)$, equivalently $H_0=\{p^*u \vert u\in L^2 M\}$. It's easy to see that the the Poincaré-inequality from $M$ lifts to functions in $H_0 \cap \mathrm{dom }(\hat D_\max)$. But does this imply that the Poincaré-inquality holds for all functions? In an attempt to understand this, let's consider a $2$-sheeted cover, for simplicity $p\colon S^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}P^2$. Then $\mathrm{Aut}(p)$ is generated by the antipodal map $a$ and we have $$ L^2\hat M = \ker (a^* -1 ) \oplus \ker (a^* + 1 )=: H_0 \oplus H_1. $$ It'd be great if he had an isomorphism $T\colon H_0 \xrightarrow{\sim}H_1$ that commutes with $D$ (on say smooth functions). But this seems to be impossible. Finding $T$ which is an iso is not hard: Let $\chi$ the characteristic function of the upper half plane, then $Tu=\chi u - a^*(\chi u)$ defines an iso, but does not even preserve the smooth subspace. If we want smooth functions to be preserved, we immediately think of a multiplication operator $Tu=\varphi u$, for an antipodal map $\varphi: S^2\rightarrow S^1$ (it has to be nowhere-vanishing, so we might as well map into the circle). But this is forbidden by Borsuk-Ulam. Using partitions of $1$? Denote $\hat u=\vert\mathrm{Aut}(p)  \vert ^{-1}\cdot \sum_{a\in \mathrm{Aut}(p)}a^*u\in H_0$ and suppose $f_1 + \dots + f_N =1$ is a partition of unity such that $a^* \mathrm{supp} f_i \cap \mathrm{supp} f_i = \emptyset$ if $a\neq \mathrm{id}$. Then all information about $u \in L^2\hat M$ is contained in the collection $(f_1 u)\hat{~},\dots , (f_1 u)\hat{~}$. For each of those we have a Poincarè-inequality and I hoped to generalize it to $u$, but for that one needs control on $\Vert df_i \Vert_{L^\infty}$ (which in general isn't even finite).","Let $D:C^\infty M \rightarrow C^\infty M$ a differential operator on a Riemannian manifold $M$.
