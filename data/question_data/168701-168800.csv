1,when can I say there is a relationship between events?,when can I say there is a relationship between events?,,"I am by no means a math expert, but I am analyzing very large weather data data for a computer science course .I am taking away all the weather related issues out of the analyzing and just looking strictly at it in the eyes of statistics. Lets say there are 2 events, 1 occurs 250 times in the year, and the other event occurs 50 times in a year. The second event occurs every single day the first event occurred. Can I say that there is a relationship between the two events? I am not sure if it is safe to say there is a good chance there is a relationship between the data because this could just be a coincidence. For example if the event A occurred 25 times a year and event B occurred 15 times again event B occurring every time event A occurred I would be more confident to say there is a relationship between the two events because there is less of a chance it is a coincidence due the the number of times event A occurred. To rephrase, lets say event A occurred 365 times in the year and event B occurred 10 times in the year, event B would occur every single time event A occurred, but this is just because event A occurred every day so there is no relationship. Is there some sort of standard to say that when two events have a statistically high probability of having a relationship of some sort? Hope this makes sense.","I am by no means a math expert, but I am analyzing very large weather data data for a computer science course .I am taking away all the weather related issues out of the analyzing and just looking strictly at it in the eyes of statistics.

2,What distribution would describe this?,What distribution would describe this?,,"I start with 100 eggs, 10 of them being broken. I randomly select eggs without replacement until they are all split into baskets of 10 eggs each. Here's what I know: Best case scenario all 10 bad eggs go into 1 basket, giving me 9 good baskets out of 10. Worst case is each basket carries 1 bad egg giving me 0 good baskets. Probability of any one basket being good, p, is 0.90^10=0.349. Mean number of good baskets would be 10*0.349=3.49? However this calculation assumes replacements, or at least requires large number of baskets/eggs to be a good approximation. Every good basket created decreases the probability that the next basket(s) will be good. For large numbers of eggs, say 50,000, is the non-replacement a big issue?

3,Accuracy of distance and bearing between GPS locations,Accuracy of distance and bearing between GPS locations,,"I'm writing on an Android app that tracks the distance and bearing between two GPS location (each from a different device). Finding the mean distance and angle between the devices is quite easy, and seems to work well.  But since my locations are rather close, and I really need the results to be as reliable as possible, I'm also trying calculating the uncertainty of the calculations, and here I need some help. I'm using the accuracy parameter I get from android as my error estimation for the GPS readings (Android docs say this parameter gives a circular radius that the location has a 68% certainty to be within, so I assume the result is normally distributed, and that this parameter is the SD). I know how to officially calculate the propagated uncertainty (using partial derivatives) if I ignore the covariance (which I have no idea if I could even theoretically find) - But this gives me a tremendous uncertainty, since both GPS readings have a very large uncertainty. The thing is, all I'm looking for is the relative distance (or angle) between these location, and I don't care where they really are compared to earth. And since I know that at lest some of this uncertainty is the same for both devices (for instance, Ionospheric effects), I could safely ignore them and get much more precise results. Even better, if part of the uncertainty comes from random errors, I could filter most of it out even before comparing the locations (Although I suspect that that the location Android provides is already filtered). The thing is, I don't know what part of the uncertainty is random and what part is constant, and I obviously have to deal with them separately... So, to sum up my problem - given two sets of GPS reading, plus their 'accuracy' , how can I tell apart the uncertainty that is the same for both sets, from the part the varies between them? I'm sure there is a good mathematical way to do this, I just can't think of one...","I'm writing on an Android app that tracks the distance and bearing between two GPS location (each from a different device).

I apologize for the length, but I would be glad to just resolve my main concern (so feel free to ignore my secondary concern). Background: To begin with, a stochastic process is a family of time-indexed random variables $X(\omega, t)$, where $w$ belongs to a sample space and $t$ belongs to an index set. For a given observation $\omega$, $X_{\omega}(t)$ is a function of $t$, which is called a realization of the stochastic process. Definition: A time series is a realization from a certain stochastic process. Main Concern: Does the definition imply that a time series is a single function (the realization of a stochastic process, corresponding to some fixed outcome $\omega$), or is a time series an assignment of time-dependent functions to each element $\omega$ in the sample space $\Omega$? In other words, we define a realization of a stochastic process relative to some fixed element $\omega \in \Omega$. But then is a time series the collection of realizations for each $\omega \in \Omega$, or just a realization for a single outcome?

If you have an answer that refers to the soft-margin SVC instead, I'd also be interested. I know that the SVC has advantages: – it does not depend on specific distributional assumptions – it deals gracefully and without special tricks with the $p > n$ situation – it produces a solution which is sparse w.r.t. the training data – it integrates naturally with the ""kernel trick"". I know that the SVC performs well in many practical problems. I know that it is possible to derive diverse upper bounds on the generalization error of the SVC. I know that the SVC is based on an optimization process: finding the separating hyperplane with the largest margin. … but I'm unclear about the statistical motivation of the margin maximization approach itself. Of course it makes intuitive sense: First make sure that all training data points are correctly classified (separating hyperplane), then choose the hyperplane that least invites any ambiguity as to how the training data should be classified. But is this more than a plausible heuristic? Is there e.g. a theorem that shows that maximizing the margin leads to the smallest generalization error under some set of assumptions? Hastie et al. write in The Elements of Statistical Learning : Not only does this provide a unique solution to the separating   hyperplane problem, but by maximizing the margin between the two   classes on the training data, this leads to better classification   performance on test data. … The intuition is that a large margin on the training data will lead to   good separation on the test data. This suggests the ""plausible heuristic"" interpretation. They further write: Vapnik’s structural risk minimization (SRM) approach fits a nested   sequence of models of increasing VC dimensions $h_1 < h_2 < \cdots$ ,   and then chooses the model with the smallest value of the upper bound.   … An example in which the structural risk minimization program can be   successfully carried out is the support vector classifier … This sounds like that what makes the SVC special is that it can be analyzed by the SRM approach – but not necessarily that it is SRM-optimal, because alternatives cannot be analyzed.

Of course it makes intuitive sense: First make sure that all training data points are correctly classified (separating hyperplane), then choose the hyperplane that least invites any ambiguity as to how the training data should be classified. But is this more than a plausible heuristic? Is there e.g. a theorem that shows that maximizing the margin leads to the smallest generalization error under some set of assumptions? Hastie et al. write in The Elements of Statistical Learning : Not only does this provide a unique solution to the separating   hyperplane problem, but by maximizing the margin between the two   classes on the training data, this leads to better classification   performance on test data. … The intuition is that a large margin on the training data will lead to   good separation on the test data. This suggests the ""plausible heuristic"" interpretation. They further write: Vapnik’s structural risk minimization (SRM) approach fits a nested   sequence of models of increasing VC dimensions $h_1 < h_2 < \cdots$ ,   and then chooses the model with the smallest value of the upper bound.   … An example in which the structural risk minimization program can be   successfully carried out is the support vector classifier … This sounds like that what makes the SVC special is that it can be analyzed by the SRM approach – but not necessarily that it is SRM-optimal, because alternatives cannot be analyzed. Can anyone shed light on this?",,"['statistics', 'optimization', 'machine-learning']"

The posterior distribution is: $$ p(\lambda, \theta \, | \, \mathbf{x}) \propto p(\theta,\lambda) f(\mathbf{x} \, | \, \lambda, \theta) $$ And then the marginal posterior distributions are: $$ \begin{cases} p(\lambda | \mathbf{x}) =\int_{-\infty}^{x_{(1)}} p(\lambda, \theta \, | \, \mathbf{x}) \, d\theta \\ p(\theta | \mathbf{x}) = \int_1^\infty p(\lambda, \theta \, | \, \mathbf{x}) \, d\lambda \end{cases} $$ Trying to answer the question If I'm not wrong: $$ p(\lambda, \theta \, | \, \mathbf{x}) \propto  \underbrace{\frac{1}{\pi\lambda^2(1+\theta)^2}}_{p(\lambda,\theta)} \, \underbrace{\lambda^n e^{-\lambda(S-n\theta)}}_{ f(\mathbf{x} \, | \, \lambda, \theta)} \qquad \left(S = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\right) $$ I think that the normalizing constant is: $$ c_n = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{x_{(1)}}  \frac{1}{1+\theta^2} \int_{1}^\infty  \lambda^{n-2} e^{-\lambda(S-n\theta)} \, d\lambda \, d\theta = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{x_{(1)}}\frac{\Gamma(n-1,S-n\theta)}{(S-n\theta)^{n-1}(1+\theta^2)}  \, d\theta $$ In this case $\Gamma(n-1,s-n\theta)$ is the Incomplete Gamma Function.
