As a starting point I have the following more specific question: Suppose that $X=\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}$, where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and that $D=\{0,1,\infty\}$. The étale fundamental group of $U_{X}=\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}\setminus \{0,1,\infty\}$ is then the profinite group generated by three elements $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3$, subject to the only relation $$ \sigma_1 \cdot \sigma_2 \cdot \sigma_3=1 $$ Finite quotients of this group classify finite galois coverings $\varphi: Y \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}$, which are étale outside of $\{0,1,\infty\}$. Is it possible to choose the covering $\varphi:Y \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}$ such that every point $y \in \varphi^{-1}(\{0,1,\infty\})$ has ramification index $e$, where $e$ is a fixed positive integer, $e \geq 2$? If so, which are the properties of the finite quotient of $\widehat{\pi}_1(\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}\setminus\{0,1,\infty\})$, associated to $\varphi$, which reflect the order of the ramification indices?

To preface, for an algebraic variety $V\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ over some field $F$, one defines $\dim V=\operatorname{trdeg}(F(x)/F)$ for a generic point $(x)$ of $V$. Also, I denote by $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ the set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$  of some homogeneous forms $f_i$ in $F[X]$. As an algebraic set, we know $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ can be written as a finite union of irreducible components without inclusion relations. Now let $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ be the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible components. Apparently for any nonnegative $d$, the set of points $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ where $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ is also an algebraic set. I identify the points $(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ as a subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ in the following way. For a finite set of forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$, let $d_1,\dots,d_r$ be the degrees, with $d_i\geq 1$ for all $i$. Each $f_i$ can be written as $$ f_i=\sum w_{i,(v)}M_{(v)}(X) $$ where $M_{(v)}(X)$ is a monomial in some set of indeterminates $(X)$ of degree $d_i$, and $w_{i,(v)}$ is a coefficient. Let $(w)=(w)_f$ be the point obtained by arranging the coefficients $w_{i,(v)}$ in some definite order, and consider this point in some affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$, where $n$ is the number of coefficients, determined by the degrees $d_1,\dots,d_r$. So given such degrees, the set of all forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ with these degrees is in bijection with the points of $\mathbb{A}^n$. So if given a fixed $d\geq 0$, then why is the set of $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ such that $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ an algebraic set? So given $d\geq 0$, I want to find all sets of forms $f_1,\dots,f_r$ such that the maximum dimension of the irreducible components of their set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$ has degree greater than that fixed $d$.

To preface, for an algebraic variety $V\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ over some field $F$, one defines $\dim V=\operatorname{trdeg}(F(x)/F)$ for a generic point $(x)$ of $V$. Also, I denote by $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ the set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$  of some homogeneous forms $f_i$ in $F[X]$. As an algebraic set, we know $V(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ can be written as a finite union of irreducible components without inclusion relations. Now let $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ be the maximum of the dimensions of the irreducible components. Apparently for any nonnegative $d$, the set of points $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ where $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ is also an algebraic set. I identify the points $(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ as a subset of $\mathbb{A}^n$ in the following way. For a finite set of forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$, let $d_1,\dots,d_r$ be the degrees, with $d_i\geq 1$ for all $i$. Each $f_i$ can be written as $$ f_i=\sum w_{i,(v)}M_{(v)}(X) $$ where $M_{(v)}(X)$ is a monomial in some set of indeterminates $(X)$ of degree $d_i$, and $w_{i,(v)}$ is a coefficient. Let $(w)=(w)_f$ be the point obtained by arranging the coefficients $w_{i,(v)}$ in some definite order, and consider this point in some affine space $\mathbb{A}^n$, where $n$ is the number of coefficients, determined by the degrees $d_1,\dots,d_r$. So given such degrees, the set of all forms $(f)=(f_1,\dots,f_r)$ with these degrees is in bijection with the points of $\mathbb{A}^n$. So if given a fixed $d\geq 0$, then why is the set of $(f_1,\dots,f_r):=(w)_f$ such that $M(f_1,\dots,f_r)>d$ an algebraic set? So given $d\geq 0$, I want to find all sets of forms $f_1,\dots,f_r$ such that the maximum dimension of the irreducible components of their set of zeroes in $\mathbb{A}^n$ has degree greater than that fixed $d$. Then for each possible set of forms meeting that condition, I identify with a point in $\mathbb{A}^n$ as described above.

Furthermore, if $A\to B$ is a morphism of finitely generated algebras over an algebraically closed field $k$ ,  the map $f:\operatorname {Spec}B\to \operatorname {Spec}A$ induces a map $\operatorname {MaxSpec}B\to \operatorname {MaxSpec}A$ , by restriction. As usual denote with $V(I)\subseteq \operatorname {Spec}R$ the vanishing set of the ideal $I\subseteq R$ , and write $Z(I)$ for $V(I)\cap \operatorname {MaxSpec}R$ . It makes sense to think if, for ideals $I,J$ in respectively $A,B$ , the following equalities hold: $$fZ(J)=fV(J)\cap \operatorname{MaxSpec} B;$$ $$f^{-1}Z(I)\cap \operatorname{MaxSpec} A=f^{-1}V(I)\cap \operatorname{MaxSpec} A.$$ Observe also that the radical of an ideal in a $k$ -algebra is the intersection of the maximal ideal over it, so in this setting the max spectrum is a dense set in the spectrum. Therefore the problem can be reduced as it follows. Let $X'\subseteq X,Y'\subseteq Y$ be dense subsets of two topological space, and let $g:X\to Y$ be a map such that $gX'\subseteq Y'$ . So $(g^{-1}(S^r))^r=(g^{-1}S)^r$ , where $S\subseteq Y$ and $-^r$ denotes the restriction to $X'$ ; this is clear even without the hypothesis that $X',Y'$ are dense, and shows the second equality. Instead the first equality becomes $g(S^r)=(gS)^r$ , where $S\subseteq X$ and $-^r$ denotes the restriction to $Y'$ ; this is true if $S$ is closed, because if a prime $\mathfrak p$ contracts to a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ , also the contraction of any maximal containing $\mathfrak p$ is $\mathfrak m$ .

I want to construct an explicit quasi-smooth embedding of the weighted K3 surface $X_{38} \subset \mathbb P(5,6,8,19)$ , in order to find and classify its singularities. (The strategy that I am using is defined in Iano-Fletcher's “Working with weighted complete intersections”, and it relies on the following fact. Let $p$ be an arbitrary point on an hypersurface $X$ of a well-formed weighted projective space $\mathbb P$ . If $\mathbb P$ near $p$ is locally isomorphic to $\mathbb C^{n+1} / G$ near the origin, then $X$ near $p$ is locally isomorphic to $\mathbb C^n / G$ near the origin. In particular, the singular points of $X$ are precisely the singular points of $\mathbb P$ that happen to be in $X$ .) I came up with the following polynomial: $$f(x,y,z,w) = zx^6 - zy^5 + yz^4 + w^2 + \lambda x^4 y^3$$ where $\lambda \in \mathbb C^\star$ is a nonzero constant to be determined. Notice that, if we set $\lambda = 0$ , then $(1,1,0,0) \in \mathbb C^4$ is a nonzero critical point of $f$ , hence the embedding is not quasi-smooth. However, if we could ignore this issue, then the singularities of $X_{38}$ would be easy to find and classify: $[0:1:1:0]$ is a singularity of type $\frac 12 (1,1)$ , hence an $A_1$ singularity. $[1:0:0:0]$ is a singularity of type $\frac 15 (1,-1)$ , hence an $A_4$ singularity. $[0:1:0:0]$ is a singularity of type $\frac 16 (-1,1)$ , hence an $A_5$ singularity. $[0:0:1:0]$ is a singularity of type $\frac 18 (-3,3)$ , hence an $A_7$ singularity. From now onwards, we will call these four points the special points . Notice that $x^4 y^3$ and its first partial derivatives vanish at the special points. Therefore, varying $\lambda$ will change neither the identified singularities nor their classification. Moreover, it is easy to check that, for $\lambda \in \mathbb C^\star$ , we obtain a hypersurface that is quasi-smooth at the special points. However, at least in principle, we might be introducing other critical points elsewhere . Therefore, my question is: How can I prove that, for some $\lambda \in \mathbb C^\star$ , the weighted projective hypersurface defined by $f$ is quasi-smooth? I am aware of Bertini's theorem for linear systems in ordinary projective space, but I do not know of any analogue that works in weighted projective space. EDIT 1: I just thought of a possible solution. Consider the ordinary (not weighted!) projective space $\mathbb P^4$ with homogeneous coordinates $x,y,z,w,t$ . Then $\mathbb C^4$ is just the open affine $t = 1$ of $\mathbb P^4$ . Homogenizing $f$ , we obtain $$f^\#(x,y,z,w,t) = zx^6 - tzy^5 + t^2 yz^4 + t^5 w^2 + \lambda x^4 y^3$$ This defines a linear system of divisors of $\mathbb P^4$ parametrized by $\lambda \in \mathbb P^1$ . By Bertini's theorem, for almost all $\lambda \in \mathbb C^\star$ , we obtain a hypersurface of $\mathbb P^4$ that is smooth away from the system's base locus, which, if I am not mistaken , is the closure in $\mathbb P^4$ of the curves in $\mathbb C^4$ that project to the special points. Thus, by adding a suitable multiple of the correction term $x^4 y^3$ , we have obtained a surface $X_{38} \subset \mathbb P(5,6,8,19)$ that is quasi-smooth away from the special points. Since we already knew that $X_{38}$ would be quasi-smooth at the special points as well, $X_{38}$ is globally quasi-smooth. QUESTION: Does this work? EDIT 2: Well, I was mistaken. A line is determined by two points. Similarly, the base locus of this linear system is determined by the hypersurfaces obtained for two distinct values of $\lambda$ . But two hypersurfaces in $\mathbb P^4$ cannot possibly intersect in just a union of curves. To make this strategy workable, I need a larger linear system, determined by linear combinations of three surfaces. But at this point I am running out of imagination... EDIT 3: Actually, I do not need a larger linear system. What I need is a larger brain to come up with the right ideas faster. The base locus of the linear system given above is the intersection of $X_{38}$ with the union of the planes $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ . On the base locus , the partial derivatives of $x^4 y^3$ are identically zero, hence the the partial derivatives of $f$ do not depend on $\lambda$ . Thus, for any point $P$ of the base locus, the following two propositions are equivalent: $P$ is a quasi-smooth point of $X_{38}$ when $\lambda = 0$ . $P$ is a quasi-smooth point of $X_{38}$ for any $\lambda \in \mathbb C$ .

95,Residue fields at points on $\mathbb{A}^n$,Residue fields at points on,\mathbb{A}^n,"Let $k=\bar k$ be a field. I'm trying to ""write down"" the residue fields at various points on $\mathbb{A}^n=\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1,\cdots, x_n]$ , but am having some trouble with the non-closed points. The definition I'm using is that residue field at a point $x$ on an integral scheme $X$ is the residue field of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_x$ . Thus, if $\mathfrak{p}$ is a point on the affine scheme $X=\operatorname{Spec} A$ then the residue field at $\mathfrak{p}$ is $A_\mathfrak{p}/\mathfrak{p}A_\mathfrak{p}$ , which is isomorphic to the fraction field of $A/\mathfrak{p}$ . On $\mathbb{A}^1=\operatorname{Spec} k[x]$ these fields are not hard to determine. The only points are the generic point $(0)$ and the closed points $(x-a)$ for $a\in k$ . Clearly the residue field at the generic point (i.e., the function field) is $k(x)$ and the residue fields at closed points are all just $k$ . Already for $\mathbb{A}^2$ , though, I'm finding this a bit trickier. The points in this case are again $(0)$ (generic), $(x-a,y-b)$ for $a,b\in k$ (closed), and $(f)$ for $f\in k[x,y]$ irreducible (nonclosed). The function field at the generic point is clearly $k(x,y)$ , and it's also not hard to see that the function fields at closed points are all $k$ . But what do we get for the function field at a nonclosed point $(f)$ ? I think this should come out to be an algebraic extension of a transcendence degree 1 extension of $k$ , but would like some clarification on this. My thoughts are as follows. Given $f\in k[x,y]$ irreducible, the function field, which we denote $k(f)$ , will be the fraction field of $k[x,y]/(f)$ . Setting $R=k[x]$ and $g(y)=f(x,y)\in R[y]$ , we have $k[x,y]/(f)=R[y]/(g(y))$ , which I believe is isomorphic to $R(\alpha)$ , where $\alpha\in \overline{k(x)}$ satisfies $g(\alpha)=0$ , i.e., is a root of a polynomial equation with coefficients in $k[x]$ . Thus, the fraction field of $k[x,y]/(f)$ should be an algebraic extension of $k(x)$ . Morally, this feels right to me in that the various function fields one obtains for $\mathbb A^2$ include transcendence degree 0,1,2 extensions of $k$ . What makes me somewhat skeptical is the choice $R=k[x]$ was completely arbitrary. The same reasoning would also show that $k(f)$ is an algebraic extension of $k(y)$ . In either case, $k(f)$ seems to be a trans. degree 1 extension of $k$ , but the degrees $[k(f):k(x)]$ and $[k(f):k(y)]$ need not be equal, which I find a bit disturbing. Can someone tell me what's going on here? In the general case $\mathbb{A}^n$ , what I expect then is that the function fields are again $k$ at the generic point, $k(x_1,\cdots, x_n)$ at the closed points, and ... transcendence degree $n-1$ extensions of $k$ at the nonclosed other points?","Let be a field.
