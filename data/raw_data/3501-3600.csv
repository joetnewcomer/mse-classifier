25000,nth term of sequences,"I'm a Phd student who teaches part time at a high school and I noticed something when teaching sequences today.

If $a_n=n^2$ then the second differences will be $2$. If $a_n=n^3$ then the third differences will be $6$. If $a_n=n^4$ then the fourth differences will be $27$.

25096,On existence of an integer between $\sqrt{n}$ and $\sqrt{2n}$ coprime to $n$,"I have one proof of the following statement, and I would like to know if there is a simpler proof.  I am not sure if “simpler” is the right word or not but, for the purpose of this question, I prefer an elementary proof rather than a short proof depending on a powerful and difficult-to-prove theorem. For any integer $n \ge 171$, there exists an integer $m$ coprime to $n$ satisfying  $n\lt m^2 \lt 2n$. The proof which I have actually gives an additional guarantee that $m$ is a prime.  I do not need this guarantee and want a simpler proof if there is one. My proof uses the method used by Nagura [Nag52], which I suspect may be overkill for this purpose.  By the same argument as the one in [Nag52], we can prove that for every $x \geq 16769$, there exists a prime between $x$ and $2^\frac 14 x$, and we can verify that the same conclusion holds for $x \ge 32$ by calculation.  This implies that for $n \ge 32^2=1024$, there exist at least two primes between $\sqrt{n}$ and $\sqrt{2n}$.  Because both primes are greater than $\sqrt{n}$, at least one of them must be coprime to $n$.  The case of  $171 \le n \le 1023$ can be verified by calculation.

25209,Looking to understand the rationale for money denomination,"Money is typically denominated in a way that allows for a greedy algorithm when computing a given amount $s$ as a sum of denominations $d_i$ of coins or bills: $$
s = \sum_{i=1}^k n_i d_i\quad\text{with } n_i > 0, d_i > d_{i-1}
$$ We start with the highest denomination $d$ not exceeding $s$ and subtract it.  We repeat this process until $s$ is completely represented. As long as all denominations are available, this simple algorithm guarantees the minimum number of coins or bills used. (This is a little sketchy but I guess we are all familiar with it and it's not central to my question.) My question is: what property of $d_i$ makes this work? I once heard that the value of any coin must be bigger than the sum of all coins of lower denomination for the greedy algorithm to work. This holds for the typical denomination: $$

25221,From baby Hartshorne: showing the exterior of a circle is segment connected,"I'm finishing up reading about Hilbert's axioms, and this final problem from Hartshorne's Geometry: Euclid and Beyond is throwing me for a loop. I'm working in a Hilbert plane, so the axioms of incidence, betweenness and congruence apply. I have the additional Archimedes' axiom, which states that for given line segments $AB$ and $CD$, there is a natural number $n$ such that $n$ copies of $AB$ added together will be greater than $CD$. However, I do not have use of the parallel postulate, nor the circle-circle intersection axiom.* I want to show that the exterior of a circle is a segment connected set, which means that if $B$ and $C$ are two points outside a circle $\Gamma$, then there exists a third point $D$ such that $BD$ and $DC$ are entirely outside $\Gamma$. My intuitive argument is straightforward. We can draw line BC. If this is outside $\Gamma$, we are done. Otherwise we can find $l$ to be the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ and take points on $l$, further and further 'out' until we find some $D$ such that $BD$ and $DC$ are outside $\Gamma$. I don't know how to formalize my idea, or why Archimedes' axiom is necessary for this to work. Hartshorne includes the warning that without it or the parallel postulate, the exterior of $\Gamma$ may not be segment connected. Also, I'm not quite sure how to show that it is indeed eventually outside $\Gamma$, since without the circle-circle intersection axiom, I can't find the center of $\Gamma$ nor can I find tangents to $\Gamma$ from $B$ or $C$. I'd be grateful for any explanation, thank you. *This states that for two circles, if one contains a point inside the other and a point outside the other, then the two circles intersect in (necessarily) two points.",['geometry']

25247,Relation between analytic functions and polynomials,"I've been stumbling across a couple of questions in Ahlfors that fall along the lines of ""If $f$ is an analytic function with property $X$, show that $f$ reduces to a polynomial."" One concrete example would be: Show that a function which is analytic in the whole plane and has a nonessential singularity at $\infty$ reduces to a polynomial. I was wondering what the general approach to these problems is. Is it to use some sort of factorization of the zeros/poles of the function and then to use Cauchy's estimate? My thought process for this particular problem has been as follows: Consider $g(z) = \frac{1}{f(\frac{1}{z})}$. Then $h(z)=0$ for $z=0$. $h$ cannot vanish identically or else $f$ is identically $\infty$ and then, $f$ does not have a nonessential singularity at $\infty$. Thus, we know that $g(z) = z^h g_h(z)$ where $g_h$ is an analytic function with $g_h(0) \neq 0$. Then we get $\frac{1}{f(\frac{1}{z})} = z^h \frac{1}{f_h(\frac{1}{z})}$ (where $\frac{1}{f_h(\frac{1}{z})} = g_h(z)$), which implies that $f(\frac{1}{z}) = z^{-h} f_h(\frac{1}{z})$. This last expression can also be equivalently written as $f(z) = z^h f_h(z)$. Then, since $f_h(z)$ is bounded as $|z| \to \infty$, we can use Cauchy's estimate to show that the $(h+1)$-th derivative of $f$ is equal to $0$ for all $z$, which implies that the function must reduce to a polynomial. I'd appreciate it if any of you could tell me if that's correct and/or if there is a better/different way to go about answering the question. As an extra note, would it be wrong to assume that any approach toward these problems with polynomials is also going to extend in some sense toward problems about rational functions?",['complex-analysis']

Edit: Some context, in case it helps: As I said I was looking for a converse of the Covering Lemma – i.e. what properties do I have to require of the metric space $X$ in addition to $X$ fulfilling the Lebesgue condition (every open cover has a Lebesgue number $\delta>0$ such that every $\delta$-ball is contained in some cover element) in order for $X$ to be compact? A property I found was the “relative finiteness” of the set $X^\star$ of the isolated points of $X$. Since I did this out of mere curiosity and never actually used it for anything, the only additional properties of “relatively finite” sets I can give you are these small ones that I needed for the proof: If, in addition to the above definition, $Y$ is open, then every sequence of points from $Y$ has a cluster point in $X$. If, in addition to the above definition, $X$ is first-countable, then the interior of $Y$ is at most countable.","['general-topology', 'reference-request']"

It was a sign mistake on one of the terms (- instead of +). Having corrected that, the method which I describe below WORKS, but DON'T USE IT ::- D. My method is convoluted and prone to mistakes (as I proved, haha). The 2 answers below offer much better choices. hardmath found a few of my mistakes and provided an alternative way of obtaining X2 and Y2 using the same system of formulas I used. On the other hand, joriki provided an alternate solution which is VERY efficient in terms of number of calculations which need to be done each frame. Eventually, I completely dropped my approach and will use his solution. Thank you hardmath and joriki, and, by all means, Math @ Stack ::- D. You people rule! I humbly thank you for helping a programmer in distress! ORIGINAL POST: Hi ::- D. I'm working on a (Flash) game and I have a weapon from which a projectile departs. The projectile travels along a line. I have the slope of the line as well as the origin (1 point). I want to calculate, depending on the Distance, where should I draw the projectile, frame by frame. The distance increases with a certain quantity each frame, as the projectile travels along the line. I have tried my best to solve this and this is what I did so far. I would not mind if you know a simpler way, but I would very much appreciate it if you would tell me why my method doesn't work (the coordinates I'm getting are very chaotic). I used these equations to build a system: http://www.analyzemath.com/Calculators/TwoPointsCalculator.html d = sqrt [ (x1 -x2)^ + (y1 - y2)^ ]

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) I took out y2: y2 = m * x2 - m * x1 + y1 From that equation, I know everything except x2. x1, y1 and m are all known . I'm out to find x2 and y2 which are the coordinates of my desired point. I removed the radical by squaring the first equation and also breaking (solving) the paranthesis. I should mention it's been a very long time since I did any math so please excuse the lack of correct terminology. Also, I'm unfamiliar with how to produce a fast MathJaX of the equations, but I think they're simple enough to be written normally. ^ - means square. I used some extra paranthesis to clear it up. d^ = x1^ - (2 * x2 * x1) + x2^ + y1^ - (2 * y2 * y1) + y2 ^ Ok so I also know who d is. Now, I took y2 and substituted it in the above equation. This is what resulted: d^ = x1^ - 2 * x2 * x1  + x2^ + y1^ - 2 * y1 * (m * x2 + K) + (m * x2 +K) ^ Where K is that part which I can calculate from the above y2 equation: y2 = m* x2 -m * x1 + y1 So now I got an equation where I know everything except x2. I reduced this equation to a quadratic equation. The final form (I solved the squared parenthesis above as well) is: x2^ ( - 1 - m^) + x2 (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K) + d^ - x1^ - y1^ + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ = 0 Looks scary doesn't it? laugh . This seems to be correct so far. Because we're talking about a line, slope and distance, it's obvious that there can be TWO points which are of distance D from my Origin (x1, y1). So I solve the quadratic equation in order to find x2-1 and x2-2 which I can then take to my first equation and get y2-1 and y2-2. So, I moved to solve the quadratic equation. First, I found a, b and c. a = -1 - m^
b = (2 * x1   + 2 *  y1 * m - 2 * m * K) 
c = d^ -  x1^ - y1^  + 2 * y1 * K - K ^ And now, I found the 2 roots: x2 = (-b + sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a
x2 = (-b - sqrt (b^ - 4ac)) / 2a Then, I found the two y2 points. And that's it ::- D. It doesn't work laugh ......... I worked for hours this morning, flexing whatever pathetic math muscles I got left and I worked all this far to end up with: (x=1509141.9643610462, y=20806970.245399687) This, in a case where the origin is at 200, 250 and the distance is 1 and the slope is 2.2 or -0.7 or whatever....... Sometimes, I even get NaN (that is, Not A Number, invalid value in ActionScript 3). So the values I'm getting are DEFINITELY not related to my origin. A point of interest however: for slope = 1.380657160570366, my projectile ACTUALLY SEEMS TO WORK , as in, it appears a bit TOO far from the Origin (about 50 pixels), but it DOES MOVE along the correct line, albeit, strangely, it ACCELERATES, even though I never increase its speed, I simply increase the distance: _ProjectileDistance += _ProjectileSpeed;
var newCoords: Point = GetPointAlongLine(weaponRootPointX, weaponRootPointY, _ProjectileDistance, _ProjectileSlope);
Projectile.x = newCoords.x;
Projectile.y = newCoords.y; And for those who know programming as well, here is what all I said looks like in code: var a: Number = - 1 - slope * slope;
  var b: Number = 2 * x1 + 2 * y1 * slope - 2 * slope * y2KnownPart;
  var c: Number = distance*distance - x1*x1 - y1*y1 - 2 * y1 * y2KnownPart - y2KnownPart*y2KnownPart;

  var x2Root1: Number = (- b + Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);
  var x2Root2: Number = (- b - Math.sqrt(b*b - 4 * a * c)) / (2 * a);

I've recently started self-studying subgroup series, which is supposed to explain the analogy, but I'm not completely sure I understand how ""any group is made of simple groups"". Given a group $G$ with composition series $$ \{e\}=G_0 \triangleleft G_1\triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_{r-1} \triangleleft G_r=G$$ then $G$ has associated the simple factor groups $H_{i+1}=G_{i+1}/G_i$. But how is it ""built"" from them? Well, if we have those simple groups $H_i$ then we can say the subnormal subgroups in the composition series can be recovered by taking certain extensions of $H_i$: $$ 1 \to K_i \to G_i \to H_i \to 1$$ where $H_i = G_i/G_{i-1}$, $K_i\simeq G_{i-1}$. Then $G$ is built from some uniquely determined (Jordan-Hölder) simple groups $H_i$ by taking extensions of these groups. Is this description accurate? The question now is: this description seems overly theoretical to me. I don't know how the extensions of $H_i$ look like, and I don't understand how $G$ puts these groups together. Can we describe more explicitly how a group $G$ is made of simple groups? EDIT: I forgot a (not-so-tiny) detail.

25430,Why are generating functions useful?,"I was under the mistaken impression that if one could find the generating function for a sequence of numbers, you could just plug in a natural number $n$ to find the nth term of the sequence.

How do they make understanding counting sequences easier? For example, suppose  I had a problem where I wanted to count how many ways I could buy $n$ pieces of apples, oranges, and pears given that I want an even number of apples, an odd number of oranges, and at most 3 pears. This would be the number of nonnegative integer solutions to $a+b+c=n$ with $a$ even, $b$ odd, and $0\leq c\leq 3$. This is the same as the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product

Also, with use of exponential generating functions, it seems the choice of monomials we use as place holders for the terms of the sequence can be arbitrary.

25763,Optimising closest approach with third order motion,"I have recently come across this problem trying to visualise a certain economic model and I'm finding the solution is just beyond my reach. As far as I can tell there is a simplification of the problem which is easier and would still be good to have answered. There are two moving point particles A and B on a Cartesian plane. Particle A is trying to reach B as quickly as possible, it can do so by applying acceleration in any direction. Its acceleration and speed have constant upper limits. Particle A knows the position and velocity of itself and of B, and can continuously[1] adjust its acceleration (which doesn't have to be continuous). What function of the particles' position and velocity should A use to reach and stop at B in as little time as possible? In the simplest version B is moving with a constant velocity, which I think will produce a better result for the complete version too, in which B can have acceleration. For many nodes targeting each other my current approach of ""accelerate as fast as possible to B's current position"" quickly resembles chaos for a few particles targeting each other in a chain. I know why that's a poor approach, I just don't know how to make a better one. If I haven't been clear enough, I'd be happy to provide a visualisation of the problem and my not-working solution. EDIT: Pretty please work this all the way through. I've shown a lot of people this problem and the pattern has been for them solve it for a single dimension then tell me that it should be easy to just do it for both dimensions. It really isn't, there's almost certainly a derivation and optimisation equation in there somewhere since there are three unknowns: acceleration on each axis and time but only two equations to solve them with (position of both particles with respect to time). Another way of looking at it is that the dimensions can't be considered separately assuming they can move with maximum acceleration, since the magnitude of the acceleration is limited there is a trade-off there. As is probably clear from my fumbling explanations, I'm not math savvy enough to translate this idea into number and figures.
