1075276,Multiple integrals involving product of gamma functions,"The following integral was posted a few days back on Integrals and Series forum:
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3}{1-\frac{1}{3}\left(\cos k_1+\cos k_2+ \cos k_3\right)}=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{24}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{5}{24}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{7}{24}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{11}{24}\right)$$ I am curious if there is a closed form solution for: $$\int_{\large[0,2\pi]^n} \frac{dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3\,\cdots \,dk_n}{1-\frac{1}{n}\left(\cos k_1+\cos k_2+\cos k_3+\cdots +\cos k_n\right)}$$ Since $\left|\dfrac{\cos k_1 + \cos k_2 + \cos k_3}{3}\right|<1$, $$\int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3}{1 - \frac 1 3 \left( \cos k_1 + \cos k_2 + \cos k_3 \right)}$$
$$=8\int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \frac{dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3}{1 - \frac 1 3 \left( \cos k_1 + \cos k_2 + \cos k_3 \right)}$$
$$=8\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{3^n} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \left( \cos k_1 + \cos k_2 + \cos k_3 \right)^n\,dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3 $$ We can ignore the odd values of $n$ as the integral is zero for them. Also, for even values of $n$, the exponents of cosines in the expansion of $\left( \cos k_1 + \cos k_2 + \cos k_3 \right)^{2n}$ must be even. Hence, from multinomial therem, we can write: $$8\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\,\,\sum_{m_1+m_2+m_3=n} \frac{1}{3^{2n}}\frac{(2n)!}{(2m_1)! (2m_2)! (2m_3)!} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \int_0^{\pi} \cos^{2m_1}k_1\cos^{2m_2}k_2 \cos^{2m_3}k_3\,dk_1\,dk_2\,dk_3$$ $$ = 16\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\,\,\sum_{m_1+m_2+m_3=n} \frac{1}{3^{2n}}\frac{(2n)!}{(2m_1)!

In each step, we pick an arbitrary number, write down the sum of the number and its two neighbors on another piece of paper, and erase that number. We do this until there are only $2$ numbers left. Prove that we will write down an even number of positive numbers. I can show that for one particular sequence of erasing, the statement is true. If we erase the numbers consecutively $1,-1,1,-1,\ldots$, we always write down the number $-1$, which means we write down an even  number (i.e., none) of positive numbers.

1075352,Probability of Big Leads in CoinTossing Game Evaporating,"In a Coin Tossing game, how is the probability of a lead change affected by the size of the lead that one side has - taking into account the number of coin flips remaining in the game? I have asked for help at Statcrunch.com, Hyperstats.com and Wolfram.com without success. Given a lead at the Halfway Point in a Coin-tossing game of 20, 100, or 1,000 flips,
Feller said that the probability of their being no further Lead Changes was roughly 50%. I have been trying to explore out how the Probability of a Lead Change is affected by the size of the Lead. So, I manually conducted 20 flip coin games, and collected a sample of 50 games where there was no lead change. I looked at 39 Leads which had reached a height of 5, and found that 43% finished the game at a higher level than 5, 33% finished at exactly 5, and 23% finished at a lower level than 5. However, this does not really give me what I want, because I did not record the size of leads in all the other games where there one or more lead changes. I would like to be able to make a probability statement about the chance of a lead of Size X evaporating into a Lead Change with N number of Coin Flips remaining in a game. I thought, ""Simple. For lead size of 5, just find out the probability of 6 or more heads occurring in a sample of N coinflips.  There are all sorts of calculators for that."" However, those calculators fail to take into account whether there were any lead changes during the samples of games of N size that are generated. So, for example, starting at a Lead of 5 Heads, the next 6 flips might be Tails, which would cause the lead to evaporate and a Lead Change to occur. But, the overall number of Heads in the next 20 flips might end end up equal to the number of Tails due to Lead Changes... So, I cannot just use the probability of tossing 13 Tails and 7 Tails in a sample of 20 to figure out the probability of a Lead Size of 5 disappearing given 20 more flips. I really do not have the time, nor the patience, to do any more manual coin flip experiments and I lack the programming skills to write some simulations to answer my questions. In basic terms, I want to know when the optimum time is to follow the advice ""Quit while you are ahead."" Does not the size of your lead affect the optimum time to quit, given N number of flips remaining in your game? What is the Probability that you will lose your lead versus increase your lead, depending upon the Size of your Lead and the number of flips remaining?",['statistics']

1075526,Two series of independent Bernoulli trials. Find distributions of being simultaneously successful and of first success being simultaneous.,"Nick and Penny are independently performing independent Bernoulli trials. For concreteness, assume that Nick is flipping a nickel with probability p1 of Heads and Penny is flipping a penny with probability p2 of Heads.

(a) Find the distribution and expected value of the first time at which they are simultaneously successful, i.e., the smallest n such that $X_n$ = $Y_n$ = 1.
  Hint: Define a new sequence of Bernoulli trials and use the story of the Geometric. (b) Find the expected time until at least one has a success (including the success).
  Hint: Define a new sequence of Bernoulli trials and use the story of the Geometric. (c) For $p_1$ = $p_2$ , find the probability that their first successes are simultaneous, and use this to find the probability that Nick’s first success precedes Penny’s. Here is my solution. I'd like to know if I did this right. a) Let $Z$ be the number of trials until (and including) the first time the are simultaneously successful. Then $Z \sim \operatorname{FS}(p_1p_2)$, where $\operatorname{FS}$ denotes the First Success distribution (equivalently, $Z-1 \sim \operatorname{Geom}(p_1p_2)$). Then $E(Z) = \frac{1}{p_1p_2}$. b) Analogous to a), the results shoult be $\frac{1}{p_1+p_2 - p_1p_2}$ c) Let $p=p_1=p_2$, $S$ be the event that their first success occurs simulateously, and $S_i$ the event that their first success occurs simultaneously at the $i^{th}$ trial. Then \begin{align}
P(S) = P(\cup_{i=1}^{\infty} S_i) &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \left((1-p)^2 \right)^{k-1} p^2 \\
&=\frac{p^2}{(1-p)^2} \frac{(1-p)^2}{1-(1-p)^2} \\
&= \frac{p^2}{1-(1-p)^2} \\

1075662,Is every measurable set a measure-independent limit of open sets,"My main question is Q1. Let $B$ be a Borel-measurable subset of $\mathbb R$. Is
  there a sequence of open sets $U_n$ independent of any measure such that for all Borel probability measures $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$, $\mu(B \Delta U_n) \to 0$? Any open set is trivially a measure-independent limit of open sets. Any closed set is an intersection of a nested sequence of open sets and hence is a measure-independent limit. I wonder if Q1 can be answered negatively by showing that $\mathbb Q$ is a counter example. Q1a. Is $\mathbb Q$ a counter example? If $B$ is a measure-independent limit of $U_n$ then $1_B$ is a pointwise-limit of the sequence $1_{U_n}$ because of Dirac delta measures. Maybe this can be used to show that $\mathbb Q$ is a counter example, but I don't know how.

1075773,Topology and Measures,"I apologize if this question is a bit vague; I'm just wondering if there is a concept like what I'm talking about, or if I'm just lost. I'll start with just some thoughts. I looked a bit, and I don't think I found what I was looking for. Admittedly, my topology is pretty much limited to a bit of point-set topology. In measure theory, we talk about a measure $\mu$ being ""continuous"" with respect to $\nu$ if the measures are related appropriately. It's my understanding that the idea of continuity is inextricable from some notion of topology. Moreover, in the context of Lebesgue measure $\lambda$, in the context of $[0, 1]$ with a typical $\sigma$-algebra, say $\mathcal{B}$, $\lambda$'s behavior seems to be related to the topology of $[0, 1]$, e.g. if I have a dense subset of $[0, 1]$, say $\mathbb{Q}$, then I can define the measure of a measurable set by a sequence of better and better coverings of the set by intervals with rational endpoints. And this seems to hold for any measure that is continuous with respect to $\lambda$. Further, say I defined $\mu(F) = \int_{F}g \, \mathrm{d}\lambda$, where $g$ is an appropriate non-negative integrable function. Then if I set $M(x) = \mu([a, x])$, then $M$ is continuous, but if I set $\mu$ to be something not $\lambda$-continuous, i.e. I don't define it by $g$, but $\mu$ gives positive measure to some singleton, then $M$ ceases to be continuous in $[0, 1]$. So my question: Is there a link between the ""continuity"" of a measure and the topology of the measure space? If so, then is there some way to define a topology on a measure space by the measure? For example, is there some way to say some set is ""dense"" with respect to the measure, in the way that we can approximate any measurable set's Lebesgue measure in $[0, 1]$ by covering it with intervals with rational endpoints?

1075889,An Infinite Cyclic Group has Exactly Two Generators: Is My Proof Correct?,"I have completed a proof of this that I am inclined to believe is correct, or at least on the right track. I would like to ask if it is indeed correct, or if I need a nudge in the right direction. Perhaps there is a better way to go about this? My Proof : (1) I will show that the existence of a generator for an infinite cyclic group implies the existence of a second which is the inverse of the former. If $G$ is an infinite cyclic group, then every element of $G$ can be written as $a^n$ for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $a$ some element of $G$. It is clear, then, that $a^{-1}$ and $a$ are both generators for $G$ since, given $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, we can choose $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $(a^{-1})^n=(a)^m$ by taking $m=-n$. Moreover, we are guaranteed that $a^{-1}\ne a$ since this would imply $a=a^{-1}=e_G$ leaving us with $G$ the trivial group. So given one generator, there must be another, namely, the inverse of the given generator. (2) Now I will show that $G$ cannot have more than two generators. Now suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n>2$ and $G=\langle{a_1}\rangle=\ldots=\langle{a_n}\rangle$ (which is to say that any one of these $n$ elements and its inverses generate $G$), where $a_i=a_j\iff i=j$. Then, by invoking the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the members of $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is not an inverse of one of the others. Let us call this element $a_i\ne a_1,a_{1}^{-1}$. Thus, if $a_1$ generates $G$, then there exists $b\in\mathbb{Z}$ for which $a_{1}^{b}=a_i$. Hence, if these both generate $G$, then $\forall{c\in\mathbb{Z}},\exists{j\in\mathbb{Z}}$ such that $a_{1}^{c}=a_{i}^{j}$, but $a_{i}=a_{1}^{b}$, so $a_{1}^{c}=a_{1}^{bj}$. But if $b\ne{\pm1}$, this is cannot be true, as this would state (for $c=b-1$) that $b-1=bj\implies j=1-\frac{1}{b}$ and then both $j$ and $\frac{1}{b}$ cannot be an integer for any value other than $b=\pm{1}$, which contradicts the assumption that $a_{i}$ is neither the inverse of $a_{1}$ nor equal to $a_1$. Combining statements (1) and (2),it follows that if $G$ has one generator and it is an infinite cyclic group, then this generator is not the identity element and $G$ must have two generators. Additionally, if $G$ is an infinite cyclic group, it cannot have $n>2$ generators. These two statements mean that $G$ must have precisely two generators.","['cyclic-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'infinite-groups']"

choose $\delta_1 =f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$ and $\epsilon_1 = \frac{\epsilon }{f'(x_0)(x-x_0)} $ Proof (3rd try):

Task is to propose such configuration of $A$, where $\eta(A) = 2$ and $s$ is maximal. $\eta(A)$ is amount of different $S$ existing for a given $A$.

1075924,Finishing a proof: $f$ is injective if and only if it has a left inverse,"I've already done a lot of searching (in particular: https://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Injection_iff_Left_Inverse ) to try to prove this statement: $f: A \to B$ is injective if and only if it has a left inverse. [I'm going to also assume $A$ and $B$ are nonempty.] My attempt so far: $\Leftarrow$ Suppose $f$ has a left inverse and $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ for
   $a_1, a_2 \in A$. Then there is a function $g: B \to A$ such that
  $g\left(f(a_1)\right) = a_1$ and $g\left(f(a_2)\right) = a_2$. Since
  $g$ is well-defined, it follows that $g\left(f(a_1)\right) =
 g\left(f(a_2)\right)$, and hence $a_1 = a_2$. $\Rightarrow$Now
  suppose $f$ is injective. Then $f(a_1) = f(a_2) \implies a_1 = a_2$.
  Furthermore, since $A$ is nonempty, there is an element $x \in A$.
  Define $g: B \to A$ by  \begin{equation*} g(b) = \begin{cases}
 f^{-1}(b), & b \in \text{Im}(f) \\ x, & b \in A \setminus
 \text{Im}(f)\text{.} \end{cases} \end{equation*} This mapping is
  well-defined, since if $f$ is injective, $f^{-1}(b)$ is unique. My main question: does this imply that if $f: A \to B$ is injective that any mapping $g: \text{Im}(f) \to A$ is bijective ?

1075953,Identifiying Biased and Unbiased Samples,"My little nephew asked me a question about biased/unbiased samples in which is teachers answer is something I disagree with to say the least (I don't agree with the assumption made by the teacher nor the lack of critical thinking within his answer). The question is, ""If Johnny took a handful of photographs and threw them up in the air, and selected 7 that landed on the rug- would this be a biased sampling?"" The teachers answer is simply, ""No, each photograph has an equal chance of landing on the rug therefore it is an unbiased sample."" I couldn't disagree more. The equal probability of each photographs landing on the rug has many dependent factors, how big is the rug compared to the room, where are you in the room when tossing the photos in the air, what is your current position relative to the rug, in what way are you tossing the photos into the air, and how were you holding them when do did it... In fact I think we could continue to give factors that would be relevant, was the window open and a breeze coming through, in what direction etc, but in only a few case of the vastly many are there the situation where the probability of landing on the rug is equal for all photographs given that the size of the rug doesn't take up the entire room. Since the question give very little to no information required to actually determine if the sampling would be biased or unbiased, can we not infer this is likely a biased sample since perfect circumstances would be needed in the room to guarantee each photograph having an equal chance of landing on the rug (because there are infinitely more ways the perfect circumstance could fail to exist if the rug isn't as big as the room)? My nephew couldn't follow what I was trying to explain so I gave him this to think about. If I stood in a big room with the rug across the room and toss the pictures in the air, there is zero probability that any will land on the rug.. I repeat this each time, inching closer to the rug, until eventually seven cards landed on the rug. Now just because the sample amount you wish to take has finally landed on the rug- is that enough to guarantee that all photographs tossed up in air during this iteration of the experiment had an equal probability of landing on the rug? If given the situation where there is enough information loss so that determining the equal distribution of probabilities for an event to occur is impossible then isn't it reasonable to assume there there may exist some bias in the result?","['statistics', 'probability']"

More precisely : $$x_1(t) = c_1\cos(w_0t + \phi_1) + c_2\cos(w_1t + \phi_2)$$ with 
$$w_0=\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$ and

I wanted to understand why there exists such a nice simplification. After asking in physics.stackexchange, a suggestion was to check Fourier series. Since the solutions $x_1(t),x_2(t)$ are periodic continuous functions ( no damping in our oscillator) , it's possible to decompose it into a fourier series, i was told. For the past day, i've been reading and understanding Fourier Series but i still lack to see the exact connection in this case. For instance, decomposing a periodic function into a fourier series might get us infinitely many cosine terms ( infinitely many coefficients ) ... Why do we have only two in that case ? Secondly, the frequency of the cosine terms in a fourier series are multiples of the lowest frequency ( fundamental frequency ). Why the frequency of the fastest cosine term is not a multiple of the frequency of the slowest cosine term, but rather a function of $k_0$. In summary, i want to understand how such chaotic motions of each mass after an arbitrary set of initial conditions could be so nicely described as a linear combination of two simple harmonic motions.

$U = \{(\rho, \theta) : 1-e^{-0.5\theta}<\rho<1-e^{-\theta}\}$ and $V = B_1(0)\setminus \overline{U}$. It's easy to show that $U$ is open, bounded and since it's path-connected it is connected.

1076178,Normal derivative expressed in polar coordinates,"A normal derivative on a given contour $\Gamma$ of a function $u$ expressed in Cartesian coordinates $u=u(x,y)$, can be calculated as:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \nabla u \cdot n = 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} n_x + 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} n_y
$$ 
where symbols are depicted in the figure. When a segment of a curve is parametrized by normalized variable $\xi \in [-1,1]$ we can describe its geometry as: $x=x(\xi)= \sum_i x_i N_i(\xi)$        and 
$y=y(\xi)= \sum_i y_i N_i(\xi)$ where $(x_i, y_i)$ are nodal points, and $N_i$ - interpolation polynomials, e.g. Lagrange polynomials. 
This leads to the derivatives: $\frac{dx}{d\xi}= \sum_i x_i \frac{dN_i}{d\xi}$ and 
$\frac{dy}{d\xi}= \sum_i y_i \frac{dN_i}{d\xi}$ The Jacobian of the transformation between local and global coordinates can be calculated as $$d\Gamma = \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} $$ and the components of the normal vector are equal $n_x = \cos \alpha = \frac{dy}{d\Gamma}$ $n_y = - \sin \alpha = -\frac{dx}{d\Gamma}$ In this way one can describe components of the normal vector in terms of Cartesian coordinates and consequently in terms of parameter $\xi$. Now what if the function $u$ and a curve $\Gamma$ are expressed in polar coordinates
$r = r(\theta)$, $\theta = [0,2\pi]$, $u=u(r,\theta)$? Recently, some paper that I found provided the following formula: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} - \frac{r'}{r^2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta}.$$ According to the theory the normal derivative in polar coordinates is given by:
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = \nabla u \cdot n = 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial r} n_r + 
\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} n_\theta
$$ 
and what I need is to express the radial and angular components of the normal vector in terms of polar coordinates, or in fact in terms of parameter $\theta$ because $r=r(\theta)$. 
Taking into account that
$x=r(\theta) \cos \theta$,
$y=r(\theta) \sin \theta$ and
$d\Gamma = \sqrt{dx^2+dy^2} $
it can be obtained that
$$d\Gamma = \sqrt{r'^2 + r^2} $$
but I can't find any trigonometric relations between $dr$, $d\theta$ and  $n_r$, $n_\theta$ as it can be found for $dx$, $dy$, $n_x$, $n_y$. So my question is: Could anyone provide formulae for $n_r$ and $n_\theta$ in terms of polar coordinates? EDIT : 
I found another paper which contains formula that I was looking for. It is different from the formula from formerly cited paper by the same author. What is more, it is a bit different from what Ted Schifrin derived. $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 
\frac{r}{\sqrt{r'^2 + r^2}}
\left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} - \frac{r'}{r^2} 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \theta} \right]
$$ The appendix of the paper gives the derivation of the formula. Now everything seems OK to me.","['multivariable-calculus', 'vector-analysis']"
1076186,What is the explicit obstruction to almost sure convergence in stochastic integrals?,"Let $B(\omega,t)$ be a Brownian motion defined on some appropriately filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F}_{t},\mathbb{P})$, and let $f(\omega,t)$ be a stochastic process defined on $\Omega$ and adapted to $\mathcal{F}_{t}$. The stochastic integral of $f$ with respect to $B$ is defined as (over some partition $\Pi_{n}$ of $[0,t]$ such that $\|\Pi_{n}\|\to0$ as $n\to\infty$)
$$\underbrace{\int_{0}^{t}f(\omega,s)\;dB(\omega,s)}_{I(\omega,t)}:=\lim_{n\to\infty}\underbrace{\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f(\omega,t_{j})[B(\omega,t_{j+1})-B(\omega,t_{j})]}_{I_{n}(\omega,t)},$$
where the limit is taken in $L^{2}$, $L^{1}$, probability, etc. but not pointwise (pathwise) with respect to $\omega$. In other words, 
$$\|I_{n}^{t}-I^{t}\|_{L^{2}(\Omega)}\to0\;\text{as}\;n\to\infty$$
or
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(\omega:|I_{n}^{t}(\omega)-I^{t}(\omega)|\geq\epsilon\right)=0\;\text{for all}\;\epsilon>0.$$ Since $t$ is held fixed throughout the entire limiting process, consider just a sequence of random variables $\{X_{n}(\omega)\}$.  Intuitively, the difference between convergence in probability and convergence pointwise is that while the probability of the set on which the $X_{n}$ and $X$ disagree goes to $0$ for both, convergence in probability allows this set to move around in the domain $\Omega$, whereas pointwise convergence requires the set to remain fixed for all variables in the sequence past some finite point.  In other words, the total probability of all the events for which $|X_{n}(\omega)-X(\omega)|>\epsilon$ must go to $0$ for both modes of convergence, but in convergence in probability the location of the events within the sample space can change (as long as the total probability is shrinking to $0$), whereas for point wise convergence they must remain fixed past some finite point (and also shrink to $0$). Is there a way to understand this concretely for the case of the stochastic integral?  For instance, what is the nature of the ""shuffling"" around the sample space that causes pathwise convergence to fail, and the shrinking of probability of ""bad"" events to $0$ that still allows for convergence in probability?  I'm willing to accept an answer for the same situation as regards $[B,B](\omega,t)=t$, which is true only when the convergence of the approximating sequence is taken in probability. The main motivation for asking this question is to help dispel the lack of intuition behind calculations involving stochastic integrals (e.g. Ito's lemma), since you'd like to think of them as taking place pointwise, but in fact they are taking place after convergence in probability.

I think this statement is true because of the following reasoning: Define $\ker(\phi)=K$, by the first isomorphism theorem we know that $K \triangleleft G$. Thus $\#K \mid \#G$ by Lagrange's theorem. Now by the first isomorphism theorem we also know that $\psi: G/K \rightarrow img(\phi)$ is an isomorphism and $img(\phi)\leq H$. (I'm not sure if this statement is true, at first I thought that $img(\phi)=H$ but an homomorphism isn't always surjective. It seems obvious to me that $img(\phi)$ should be a subgroup of $H$ but I wouldn't know how to show this. I'm assuming that this is true though). Thus $\# img(\phi) | \# H $. $\mid G/K\mid=\frac{\mid G\mid}{\mid K \mid}=\mid img(\phi) \mid$ rewriting this statement gives $\frac{|G|}{|img(\phi)|}=|K|$. So my conclusion is that $img(\phi)$ divides both $\#G$ and $\#H$. And because $\phi$ has a non-trivial image this statement is true.
