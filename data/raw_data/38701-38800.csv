378487,Finding fundamental set of solution of higher order differential equation,"The fundamental set of solution $$y^{(4)} - 16y = 0$$ I worked this problem out but I was under the impression that I can apply the general method of characteristic equation to solve : $$ r^4 - 16 = 0$$ $r = \pm 2 $ so my solutions are $e^{2t} $ and $e^{-2t}$ and then I can use the Wronskian to check if it is fundamental or not. If $$W(e^{2t}, e^{-2t}) \neq 0 $$ then it is fundamental (and also linearly dependent). This is true. However, the book's solution to this problem is $$e^{2t}, e^{-2t}, cos(2t),sin(2t)$$ But I don't understand why there could be sinusoidal functions in the set of fundamental solutions since the gen. solution to the problem has no imaginary part.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

378642,Looking for help in understanding Jitsuro Nagura's analysis of the upper bound for $\psi(x)$,"I'm working on understanding Nagura's analysis of the upper bound for $\psi(x)$ which is done in Lemma 2.  I am unclear on one step of his reasoning. With Lemma 1, he establishes for $x \ge 2000$ : $$\log\Gamma(\lfloor{x}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{2}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{3}}\rfloor+1)- \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{7}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{43}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{1806}}\rfloor+1) < 1.0851x$$ With Lemma 2, he shows that for $x > 0$ : $$\log\Gamma(\lfloor{x}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{2}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{3}}\rfloor+1)- \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{7}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{43}}\rfloor+1) - \log\Gamma(\lfloor{\frac{x}{1806}}\rfloor+1)  \ge \psi(x) -\psi(\frac{x}{1806})$$ Now, it's the next step that confuses me.

378694,What is the canonical definition of an open set?,"The definition of an open set that I see in most topology texts(like the ones found in Topology by Munkres and another w/ the same title by Hocking & Young, or Basic Topology by Armstrong) is that a set S is open iff it is a neighborhood of all of its points. But the definition of a neighborhood of a point $x$, $N(x)$, is that there's an open subset $U$ of $N$ containing $x$. Now if $X$ is a topological space with a metric function $d$, then any non-empty subset $S$ is open iff $\;\forall x\in S,\;\exists\epsilon>0$ such that  $B=\{y \in X \mid d(x,y)<\epsilon\}\subset S$.

378717,Finding counterexamples: bijective continuous functions that are not homeomorphisms,"Let $f: X \to Y$ be a bijective continuous function.  If $X$ is compact, and $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $f:X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism. My goal is to demonstrate the necessity of both the compact and Hausdorff property of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.  I want to know if my counter examples are correct: Let $f: X \to Y$ be the identity function. (1)  Let $X=[0,1]$ with the standard topology and let $Y=[0,1]$ with the indiscrete topology.  Then $f: X \to Y$ is continuous and bijective but not a homeomorphism.  Since $U=(1/3,1/2)$ is open in $X$, but $(f^{-1})^{-1}(U)=f(U)$ is not open in $Y$. (2) Let $X=Y=\mathbb{R}$.  Let $Y$ have the standard topology and $X$ have the discrete topology.  Let $U=\{x\}$ since open sets are singletons.  $f(^{-1})^{-1}(x)=f(x)$ is closed in $Y$ since $Y$ has the standard topology.  Hence $f$ is not a homeomorphism. This is the old question My goal is to demonstrate the necessity of both the compact and Hausdorff property of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.  I want to know if my counter examples are correct: Let $f$ be the identity function.  Then $f: X \to Y$ be a bijective continuous function.  If $X=[0,1]$ with the standard topology and $Y=[0,1]$ with the indiscrete topology we have that $f:X \to Y$ is not a homeomorphism. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a bijective continuous function, $X=(0,1)$, and $Y=[0,1]$ both with the standard topology.  It's not a homeomorphism because $f^{-1}([0,1])$ is not connected, but $[0,1]$ is connected. The first shows why Hausdoff is necessary for $Y$ and the second shows compactness is necessary for $X$. Are both of the examples correct?  I have no confidence in my first example because I'm having problems showing $f^{-1}$ is not continuous.

378751,Can the $0$-norm represent determinism?,"In Scott Aaronson's Quantum Computing since Democritus , he presents classical probability theory as based on the $1$-norm, and QM as based on the $2$-norm. Call $\{v_1,\ldots,v_N\}$ a unit vector in the $p$-norm if $|v_1|^{\ p}+\cdots+|v_N|^{\ p}=1$ The slide below is from a presentation of his. Now, he seems to claim that the $1$-norm and the $2$-norm are the only options here, although earlier in the book he allowed for three choices: (1) determinism, (2) classical probabilities, or (3) quantum mechanics. My question is: Would it be natural to let determinism be simply based on the $0$-norm? Is this problematic? Wouldn't the definition $0^0=0$ (for this purpose) and $p_i\in\{0,1\}$ suffice? If so, what would be the equivalent to ""probability vector"" and ""amplitude vector"" be called?

378937,"Class group of $k[x,y,z,w]/(xy-zw)$","I had a homework problem (II.6.5 in Hartshorne) to compute the (Weil divisor) class group of $X=\operatorname{Spec} k[x,y,z,w]/(xy-zw)$.  I have accomplished this; however, I used some results I don't fully understand. I was left with the conviction that there is a simpler way to do it using tools I do understand. I am hoping you can help me find it. The part I do understand: Let $Z$ be the prime divisor associated with the ideal $(y,z)$. I have an exact sequence $$\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \operatorname{Cl} X \rightarrow \operatorname{Cl} \left(X\setminus Z\right) \rightarrow 0$$ where the first map sends $1\mapsto [Z]$ and the second map sends a divisor to its intersection with $X\setminus Z$. (This is Hartshorne proposition II.6.5.) Now 
$$X\setminus Z = \operatorname{Spec} k[x,y,y^{-1},z,z^{-1},w]/(xy-zw)$$
but this ring is isomorphic to $k[x,y,y^{-1},z,z^{-1}]$ because $w=xyz^{-1}$. This is a unique factorization domain, so $\operatorname{Cl} \left(X\setminus Z\right)=0$. Thus $\operatorname{Cl} X$ is a cyclic $\mathbb{Z}$-module, generated by $[Z]$. The question is whether $[Z]$ is torsion or not. I've obtained that $[Z]$ is non-torsion (thus $\operatorname{Cl}X \cong \mathbb{Z}$) by showing $\operatorname{Cl}X$ is infinite, in turn by relating $\operatorname{Cl}X$ to the class group of the projective quadric surface $Q$ of which it is the affine cone. I used the result of an exercise in Hartshorne (II.6.3) relating a projective variety's class group to that of its affine cone. I feel confident that the argument works, but I am personally unsatisfied both because I'm not fully comfortable with the reasoning in exercise II.6.3, and because the whole argument is rather indirect. What I'm looking for: What I would like is a direct way of seeing that $[Z]$ is non-torsion, i.e. that $n[Z]$ is not principal for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. Can you offer a direct argument that $[Z]$ is non-torsion in $\operatorname{Cl}X$? I have given this some thought (below), but I am stuck. My work so far: Let $A=k[x,y,z,w]/(xy-zw)$ and let $\mathfrak{p}=(y,z)$. Suppose there is some $f\in K(X)=\operatorname{Frac}A$ such that $div(f)=n[Z]$ for some $n\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. By replacing $f$ with $f^{-1}$ if necessary, we can assume that $n>0$. I think that in this case $f\in A$ and $\mathfrak{p}^{(n)}$, the $n$th symbolic power of $\mathfrak{p}$, is principal and generated by $f$. I think this because since $A$ is an integrally closed noetherian domain, it is the intersection of its localizations at the height 1 primes, which are precisely the DVRs associated to the valuations induced by the prime divisors. $div(f)$ is effective, so this means $f$ is in the intersection of these DVRs, thus $\in A$. Furthermore, for any element $g$ of $A$ whose $Z$-valuation is $\geq n$, we must have $g/f\in A$ for the same reason. (Hartshorne uses reasoning like this several times in section II.6.) It follows that $f$ generates the ideal $\{g\in A\mid v_Z(g)\geq n\}$. But this ideal is the contraction in $A$ of $\mathfrak{p}_\mathfrak{p}^nA_\mathfrak{p}$; this is $\mathfrak{p}^{(n)}$. Therefore, proving that $[Z]$ is non-torsion in $\operatorname{Cl} X$ is equivalent to proving that $\mathfrak{p}^{(n)}\triangleleft A$ is never principal. I had the thought to mimic Hartshorne's reasoning (in example II.6.5.2) and show that $\mathfrak{p}^{(n)}$'s image in some appropriate vector space, e.g. let $(x,y,z,w)=\mathfrak{m}$ and find the right $\mathfrak{m}^n/\mathfrak{m}^{n+1}$, is never one-dimensional. However, in general, $\mathfrak{p}^{(n)}$ needn't be contained in $\mathfrak{m}^n$, so I wasn't sure how to get this going. Thanks in advance for your thoughts. NB: Because this question arose out of a homework problem for me, I'm using the homework tag to be safe, but I intend to turn in the proof I described above, so this question is not intended to help me with my assignment, just my understanding.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

379116,"A numeral system built around Dirichlet series, by analogy of how positional numeral systems are built around power series?","For any natural number and chosen base p, the number admits a unique expression of the form $a_np^n + ... + a_2p^2 + a_1p^1 + a_0$, where $a_k < p$ for all k. This property is effectively what makes our Hindu-Arabic positional numeral notation system possible. When you multiply two polynomials (or power series) together, you're essentially taking the discrete convolution of their ordered sequences of coefficients. This is essentially what we're doing when we multiply numbers in a positional numeral system, except that there's an additional ""carry"" step involved to put the number back into its canonical representation. Another useful type of infinite series is a Dirichlet series, which looks like $ ... + a_3 3^p + a_2 2^p + a_1$; p is now the exponent rather than the base. Could this sort of series also be the foundation for a numeral system? For instance, is there a way to canonically represent any number as a finite sum $a_n n^p + ... + a_3 3^p + a_2 2^p + a_1$? When multiplying two numbers in this format, would multiplication resemble Dirichlet convolution rather than ordinary convolution, with some other type of ""carry"" to make the whole thing work out?

Attempt:
$D_9$ acts on the set $X$ of three triangles, so $|X| = 3$.  I presume in such a way that the vertices of the triangles are permuted.  $G$ is finite and the action is faithful(This is true I think since it is given initially that the three triangles are constructed using all nine vertices, so any perumtation of the vertices will map a single vertex to another).  Hence we may write $$G \cong \text{subgroup of}\, S_3 = \text{subgroup of}\,S_{|X|}$$  So we want $G \cong \langle \text{id} \rangle \leq S_3$, where id is the identity permutation in $S_3$.  The answer to this question is in fact the subgroup $\left\{e,g^3,g^6\right\} = \langle g^3 \rangle$.  So assign a bijection $e \rightarrow 1\,\,g^3 \rightarrow 2\,\,g^6 \rightarrow 3$ and let $G$ act on itself by the left action $g \cdot h := gh$.

Let $\varepsilon$ be a abritary positive constant. Define $E_n=\{\omega\in \Omega: |X_n(\omega) -X(\omega)|\geq \varepsilon\}$. Let $S=\cap_{n=1}^{\infty} \cup_{k=n}^{\infty} E_k$. Since $X_n \rightarrow X$ in probabilty, we have

379310,A question about the stability of a property of the normal distribution,"Recall that the standard normal distribution can be characterized as the unique standardized (having mean zero and unit variance) distribution $P$ on $\mathbb{R}$ with the property that with $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ independent variables with distribution $P$, it holds that $Z$ has the same distribution as $X/\sqrt{2}+Y/\sqrt{2}$. In other words, the normal distribution can be characterized as a standardized 2-stable distribution. Loosely put, my question is whether this characterization is stable under perturbation, in the following sense: $\textbf{Question.}$ Consider a standardized distribution $P$ on $\mathbb{R}$ and independent variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ with distribution $P$. If $Z$ almost has the same distribution as $X/\sqrt{2}+Y/\sqrt{2}$, is $P$ almost a normal distribution? The question can be made more precise in the following manner. Consider a metric $d$ on the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$. What are the optimal functions $c$ and $C$ such that $\qquad c(d(P,\mathcal{N})) \le d(P, t(P)\ast t(P))\le C(d(P,\mathcal{N}))$ where $\mathcal{N}$ denotes the standard normal distribution and $t(x)=x/\sqrt{2}$? Inequalities such as the above would essentially show that if $P$ is close to $2$-stable, then $P$ is close to normal, and vice versa, and would bound the rates at which this ""closeness"" occurs. For some perspective, a similar result is known which instead compares what is known as the ""components"" of a distribution. Let $d_L$ denote the Levy-Prokhorov distance (which metrizes weak convergence). It holds that there is a mapping $\delta(\varepsilon)$ such that if $P = P_1 \ast P_2$ and $d(P,\mathcal{N})\le \varepsilon$, then $d(P_1,\mathcal{N}')\le\delta(\varepsilon)$ and $d(P_1,\mathcal{N}'')\le\delta(\varepsilon)$ for some normal distributions $\mathcal{N}'$ and $\mathcal{N}''$, where $\delta(\varepsilon)$ tends to zero as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. In other words, for distributions which are close to normal, its components (the $P_1$ and $P_2$ above) must be close to normal as well. Furthermore, the asymptotically optimal rate of $\delta(\varepsilon)$ is known: By a result of Golinskii & Chistyakov (building on many previous results), it holds that the optimal rate is $\qquad(\log\log 1/\varepsilon)^2/\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon}$ as $\varepsilon$ approaches zero.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'measure-theory', 'inequality']"

$$
   \widetilde B = \begin{bmatrix} A & b+Aa \\ (b+Aa)^T & a^T A a+ 2b^T a + c \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Now let $\chi_B(\lambda) = (-\lambda)^{n+1} + I_0(B)(-\lambda)^{n} + \ldots + I_n(B)$ be characteristical polynomial of matrix $B$. Since $\det T_a = 1$ we have $I_n(B)=I_n(\widetilde B)$. Question. If $\det A = 0$, $\rank B \leqslant \rank A + 1$ is it possible to say that for general $a$ for some $0<k<n$ the equality $I_k(B) = I_k(\widetilde B)$ holds? Geometrical meaning. Matrix $B$ corresponds to the equation of the second order algebraic hypersurface in $\mathbb R^n$:
$$
   \begin{bmatrix} x & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} A & b \\ b^T & c \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = 0,
$$
that can also be written in the form $x^T Ax + 2b^T x + c = 0$. If we make a change of coordinates $x = y+a$ then we will obtain an equation

379470,Function field question from Silverman's AEC,"Just before Proposition 1.7 on page 5 of AEC (2nd ed), Silverman defines $M_P$ as an ideal in the affine coordinate ring. Then he states Proposition 1.7 (the intrinsic characterization of smoothness):
$\dim(M_P/M_P^2) = \dim(V)$. His proof is an appeal to Theorem I.5.1 of Hartshorne. And this is how my question arises. Hartshorne uses the maximal ideal in the local ring, not a maximal ideal in the affine coordinate ring and this seems to be the standard way of doing so. Since the local ring is the localization of the affine coordinate ring by the maximal ideal associated with the point, using results like Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 (on the behavior of ideals with regard to localization) in Matsumura's ""Commutative Ring Theory"", I suspect one can make this all work out. So to ask specific questions: (1) is there a reason or benefit to defining $M_P$ as Silverman has done here?
(as opposed to Hartshorne and others) (2) if so, then why does he change to the ""conventional"" definition of $M_P$ in Chapter II?

However, I'm not having much luck getting anywhere as combinatorics is not something I'm particularly good at. The Coupon Collector's Problem is stated as: There are $m$ different kinds of coupons to be collected from boxes. Assuming each type of coupon is equally likely to be found per box, what's the expected amount of boxes one has to buy to collect all types of coupons? What I'm attempting: Let $N$ be the random variable associated with the number of boxes one has to buy to find all coupons. Then $P(N=n)=\frac{|A_n|}{|\Omega _n|}$, where $A_n$ is the set of all outcomes such that all types of coupons are observed in $n$ buys, and $\Omega _n$ is the set of all the possible outcomes in $n$ buys. I think $|\Omega _n| = m^n$, but I'm not even sure about that anymore, as all my attempts so far led to garbage probabilities that either diverged or didn't sum up to 1.","['coupon-collector', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

379569,Can someone give me a deeper understanding of implicit differentiation?,"I'm doing calculus and I want to be an engineer so I would like to understand the essence of the logic of implicit differentials rather than just memorizing the algorithm. Yes, I could probably memorize it and get a 100% on a test, but it means nothing unless I understand it and can acquire a practical understanding of it. I would really appreciate if someone can enlighten me. What I understand already: I understand how the derivatives of normal functions are found the long way... i.e. $ f'(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x))}{(x+h)-x} $ I understand that the derivative of the above equation is found when we find the limit as h , representing the distance between the two points, approaches 0. I also understand that the chain rule, quotient rule, etc. are just algorithms that speed up the process of finding the derivative. I don't need a proof for that An example problem When we do implicit differential equations such as this one: A ladder is 8.5 m long leaning against a wall, the bottom part of the ladder is 6.0 m from the wall and is sliding away from the wall at a rate of 2.5m/s. $x^2 + y^2 = h^2$ (Pythagorean theorem) (x is x value, y is y value, h is hypot)
We can find that y = 6.2m. The derivative is 
$2x\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t} + 2y\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{d} t} = 2h\frac{\mathrm{d} h}{\mathrm{d} t}$ What I don't understand: (although I can do them by memorizing the algorithm) Is the implicit differential... How do we relate all the terms to the change in time? I mean how do we know we can make that equation's derivative with respect to t? Would it be possible to make them all with respect to the change in x? If so please demonstrate, I think that would help a lot as my biggest lack of understanding is how to know what the bottom term should be for each derivative term.

379605,Can someone explain this integration trick for log-sine integrals?,"I was working on this rather challenging log-sine integral: $$
\int_{0}^{2\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}\left(2\sin\left(x \over 2\right)\right)\,{\rm d}x = {13\pi^{5} \over 45}
$$ The upper limit is a waiver from the norm of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ . Anyway, when integrating log-sin integrals one can often times use the famous identity $$\displaystyle -\ln(2\sin(x/2))=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(kx)}{k}$$ by switching sum and integral, integrating, then evaluating the sums. However, this is only valid when $x\neq \pm \pi,\pm2\pi,\ldots$ . So, just for the heck of it, I decided to do something I thought would not be viable but have done it anyway. I integrated $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{x^{2}\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}},$$ evaluated the resulting sums and arrived at $\displaystyle \frac{41{\pi}^{5}}{180}$ . Now, take the integral $$\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\cos(x/2))dx=\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}.$$ This one can be done by using Cauchy's cosine formula, differentiating, and so on. Anyway, note that when I add the two results, the correct result for the integral at hand is obtained. $$\displaystyle \frac{41{\pi}^{5}}{180}+\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}=\frac{13{\pi}^{5}}{45}.$$ By quandary/query is why does this happen to work?. A fluke? Does that cosine sum represent something that when evaluated and added to the above log-cos integral happens to be equivalent to the log-sine integral in question?. See what I am trying to explain?. I done something I knew I was not supposed to, but it happened to work out. If viable, what would $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{x^{2}\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}}$ represent such that when it is added to $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\cos(x/2))dx=\frac{11{\pi}^{5}}{180}$ equals $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{2\pi}x^{2}\ln^{2}(2\sin(x/2))dx=\frac{13{\pi}^{5}}{45}$ . I knew I could not just square the cosine and multiply by $x^2$ . But,sometimes it can be done due to Parseval, i.e., $\displaystyle \ln^{2}(2\sin(x/2))=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(nx)\cos(kx)}{nk}$ . Then, because $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}\cos(nx)\cos(kx)dx=0, \;\ n\neq k$ , one can integrate $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\cos^{2}(kx)}{k^{2}}$ , then sum. This works for $2\pi$ as well, but that $x^2$ term tends to throw a wrench in things But I do not think I can do this in my case because of the $x^2$ term.  Or can I?. I was surprised when I saw this. I thought perhaps I stumbled onto a cool way to evaluate this, but I am not entirely sure what I have. Or, if anyone has their own clever method?. EDIT:  I managed to evaluate this integral by considering the identity $$\ln\left(2\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\right)=\ln(1-e^{ix})+\frac{i}{2}(\pi -x)$$","['definite-integrals', 'calculus']"

(Or is it uninteresting unless you at least have a convex body domain in a Euclidean space or something?)  Furthermore, it is my observation that although a lot of functions seem to satisfy Hölder conditions for all exponents in intervals of the form $(0, r)$ or $[0, r)$ that actually in general one does not have that Hölder of any exponent implies Hölder of any other exponent.  In particular, a Lipschitz function can be not Hölder-1/2.  But all Hölder functions are automatically uniformly continuous.  Please let me know if all these are correct.  I guess being familiar with Lipschitz continuity for a long time I should not be bothered by this, but it disturbs me that Holder continuity can be violated ""just because"" the function has bad asymptotic behavior, whereas I think of uniformly continuous as a local adjective.  Moreover, many mathematicians have, in my opinion, spoken of Hölder continuity as if it's ""harder"" to have it for higher exponents.

$$ then we can solve this equation as follows:
$$
y - 1 = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left(1 + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left( \cdots \right) \right) \iff \int y - 1 \, \mathrm{d} x = 1 + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left( 1 + \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} \left( \cdots \right) \right)
$$
$$
\implies \int y - 1 \, \mathrm{d} x = y \iff y - 1 = \frac{\mathrm{d} y }{ \mathrm{d} x}
$$ So $$
\ln \left( y - 1 \right) = x + C \iff y = Ce^x + 1
$$ This problem reminded me a lot of nested radical expressions such as:
$$
x = 1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{ 1 + \sqrt{ \cdots }}} \iff x - 1 =  \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{ 1 + \sqrt{ \cdots }}}

$$
\implies (x - 1)^2 = x \iff x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0

x = 0 + \sqrt{ 1 + 2 \sqrt{ 1 + 3 \sqrt{1 + 4 \sqrt{ \cdots }}}}

$$ s=-16t^2+460t\\\vec{v}=-32t+460\\\vec{a}=-32$$ Then from here I was lost in what to do. Therefore, I just found $t$ for both objects when there slope is equal to $0$.

379709,Vakil 14.2.E: $\mathcal L \cong \mathcal O_X(\mathrm{div}(s))$ for $s$ a rational section.,"I am working through Vakil's Ch. 14 (march2313 version) on invertible sheaves and am having trouble on 14.2.E. The question (in notation to be defined) is this: how do I show that each point in the support of $D$ is contained in some set in $B$ ? Let $X$ be a Noetherian normal scheme, $\mathcal L$ an invertible sheaf on $X$ , and $s$ a rational section, $D = \mathrm{div}(s)$ . This means that $s$ is an equivalence class of sections over open sets containing all of the associated points of $X$ . We associate to $D$ a sheaf $\mathcal O_X(D)$ defined by $$\mathcal O_X(D)(U) = \{t\in K(X):\: \mathrm{div}\rvert_{U}(t)+D\geq 0\},$$ where $K(X)$ is the total quotient ring of $X$ , which coincides with the function field if $X$ is irreducible. Part of the exercise is to show that $B = \{\mathrm{open}\: U\subset X:\: \mathcal O(\mathrm{div}(s)) \rvert_U \cong \mathrm O_U \}$ is a base for the Zariski topology on X. On each such set it is easy to see that $\mathcal O_X(D)(U)\longrightarrow \mathcal O_X(U)\longrightarrow \mathcal L(U)$ defined by $t\longmapsto t\longmapsto ts$ is an isomorphism, so in the end we find that $\mathcal O_X(\mathrm{div}(s))\cong \mathcal L$ . The complement $U$ of (the support of) $D$ is such an open set; sections over $U$ are those $t\in K(X)$ having nonnegative valuation at every codimension 1 point contained in $U$ . Since $X$ is normal, $\mathcal O_X(U)$ is normal, so Hartog's lemma gives that $$\mathcal O_X(U) = \bigcap_{q\in U, \mathrm{codim}(q)=1}\mathcal O_{X,q},$$ so we find that $t\in \mathcal O_X(U).$ Taking distinguished open sets in $U$ gives a basis in U, so we need only consider those points in the support of $D$ . Suppose $p\in D$ . If $p$ lies is only one prime divisor $Y$ in $D$ , then the complement $U$ of the other componenets is an open set over which the only constraint on sections of $\mathcal O_X(D)$ is that they satisfy $v_Y(t)+v_Y(s)\geq 0$ ( $v_Y$ being the valuation on $\mathcal O_{X,Y}$ ), so I should be able to find an isomorphism of $\mathcal O_X(D)(U)\cong \mathcal O_X(U)$ gotten by multiplying by an appropriate power of a uniformizer in $\mathcal O_{X,Y}$ , but I'm not sure how to make this go. For those $p$ contained in more than one irreducible component of $D$ , things seem worse because it could be that $p$ generizes to two prime divisors where $s$ has different nonzero orders. So then I want to to inject into the direct product of the associated points...? I hope I have made my points of confusion sufficiently clear.","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"
379712,"$g(\theta):= f(\theta {\bf y} + (1 − \theta){\bf x})$, find $g'$.","Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and let  $g: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $g(\theta):= f(\theta {\bf y} + (1 − \theta){\bf x})$. I want to calculate the derivative $g'$. I set $z=\theta {\bf y}+ (1 − \theta){\bf x}$, then: $$
\frac{\mathrm{d}g}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=
\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}z} \frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}\theta}=
\nabla f^\mathsf{T} ({\bf y}-{\bf x})
$$ Is this formally correct? 
If it is not wrong, is it possible to write it better?","['multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

379716,Geometry question with rectangles purely out of curiosity,"Apologies in advance, I really cannot think of an intelligent or easy way to explain this. You start out with a rectangle. Then you draw a straight line out of a right angled corner at 45 degrees until you hit a side of the rectangle at which point you reflect the line at 90 degrees and continue the line. Repeat this process until the line goes into a second corner. Sorry if that image is hard to imagine. If you add the length and width of the rectangle (providing they are both integers and have no common factors) that is the number of points of contact the lines have with the outline of the rectangle: (the walls and the 2 corners) If the lengths aren't integers then you have to make then integers before you add them eg. 0.2cm and 0.3cm = 2cm and 3cm. Or if they have factors then factorise them eg. 6cm and 4cm = 3cm and 2cm QUESTION
If anyone understands all of that, can anyone explain if and why that is true for every rectangle? Is it just a coincidence or is there maths behind it that I can't find? And can it work if one of the lengths was an irrational number like pi?",['geometry']
379731,Prove that $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} p^{2i}$ ($p$ is prime) is never a perfect square,"Prove that
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{k} p^{2i}
$$
where $k > 0$ and $p$ is an arbitrary prime, is never a perfect square. I think you can prove it by letting $q = \sum\limits_{i=0}^k a_ip^i$, then expanding $q^2$ and equaling coefficients of $p^l$ in $q^2$ and the original sum, thus showing no such $a_i$ in $q$ exist. But I'm kinda looking for a more elegant solution. Thanks.","['prime-numbers', 'summation', 'number-theory']"
379753,Pullback of sheaves and pullback of schemes,"Let $\mathbb{G}_m$ the multiplicative group, with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[x^{\pm 1}]$, and considered as a sheaf of abelian groups over $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{C}$ in the Zariski topology. Let $X$ be another complex scheme (I am interested in $X$ being a smooth projective variety, but I do not think it matters anyway). Denote by $p$ the structure morphism of $X$ down to $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{C}$. There are two (seemingly different) ways of pulling $\mathbb{G}_m$ back to $X$: As sheaves of abelian groups, $p^{-1}\mathbb{G}_m$ is the sheafification of the presheaf $$(p^{-1}\mathbb{G}_m)^\mathrm{pre}(U) = \varinjlim_{V \supseteq p(U)}\,\mathbb{G}_m(V)$$ Since $p(U)$ is the whole of $\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{C}$ for any nonempty $U$, we have $(p^{-1}\mathbb{G}_m)^\mathrm{pre}(U) = \mathbb{G}_m(\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{C}) = \mathbb{C}^\times$, so $p^{-1}\mathbb{G}_m$ is the locally constant sheaf $\underline{\mathbb{C}^\times}$. As schemes, the pullback $X \times_{\mathrm{Spec}\,\mathbb{C}}\mathbb{G}_m$ is an abelian group scheme over $X$ whose sheaf of sections is $\mathbb{G}_m(\mathcal{O}_X)$ —that is, the sheaf of functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{G}_m$. I have always thought that the first construction gave the result of the second, but I seem to have argued otherwise here. Have I made a mistake? Or am I right but the pullback as schemes is some other functor (maybe the exceptional inverse image $p^!$)?","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'topos-theory']"
