2244986,Visualizing transpose of matrices,"I am a new linear-algebra student. I find linear algebra really difficult ,however, visualizing concepts really helps me out. So I stumbled upon rotation matrices and the book stated that the transpose of B times B must equal to the identity matrix. So are there any sources I could use to maybe view transposes for myself and kind of figure it out. And if not, I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks!","['matrices', 'transpose', 'linear-algebra']"
2244988,Quotient Riesz space given by a filter $\mathscr{F}$ is Archimedean iff $\mathscr{F}$ is closed under countable intersections.,"The following is given as Example 1XE in Fremlin's Topological Riesz Spaces and Measure Theory . Let $X$ be a nonempty set, $E = \mathbb{R}^X$, and $\mathscr{F}$ be a filter on $X$. Let 
$$F = \{x \in E: \{t: x(t)=0 \} \in \mathscr{F} \}.$$ The quotient Riesz space $E/F$ is Archimedean iff $\mathscr{F}$ is closed under countable intersections. I am having trouble proving this. In fact, I haven't been able to make any progress at all, which means I must be failing to grasp something very basic. I am not looking for a complete answer, just a hint to get me started. I suspect my gap in understanding has to do with Riesz quotient spaces. All I really know about them is from Fremlin's 14G, where he shows that $E/F$ can be given a Riesz space structure. In particular, he shows that the positive cone $P$ of $E/F$ is given by the canonical map $\phi: E \to E/F$ by $P = \{\phi(x): x \in E^+ \}$, and that $\phi(x) \vee 0 = \phi(x^+)$. For completeness, Fremlin's definition is that $E$ is Archimedean if $x,y \in E$ and $ny \leq x$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ imply $y \leq 0$.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'vector-lattices', 'filters']"
2245028,the 8 queens conjecture: the next level (or dimension),"i know you have possibly seen my last problem on the 8 Queens conjecture, and it was answered by a person named Peter Kagey. he mentioned that: With regard to a $n×n×n$ chessboard, one could simply place $n$ queens at the ""bottom board"" of the cube, and use the $n*n$ configuration. This argument shows that A000170 would serve as a lower bound on the number of configurations on the $n×n×⋯×n$ analog of the nonattacking queens problem. If the sequence A000170 is the lower bound, what is the maximum number of queens that can go onto a 3-D chessboard? 4-D? so on?

2245030,factor of Riemann Zeta product formula must be zero?,"Riemann Zeta as Euler Product As you likely know, the Riemann Zeta function, commonly expressed as a sum: $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$$ can be written as an Euler product formula: $$\zeta(s) = \prod_{p\ prime} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$ Zeros For the Riemann Zeta function to be zero, this means at least one of those product factors must be zero: $$\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} = 0$$ Flaw? Why is the above logic considered incorrect? Where is the flaw? If it is indeed correct, then why don't mathematicians talk about proving the Riemann Hypothesis that non-trivial zeros lie on the $Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ line, by focussing on these factors, one of which must be zero?","['number-theory', 'complex-analysis', 'riemann-zeta', 'prime-numbers']"
2245057,Central Limit Theorem Proof using Characteristic Functions,"I have my proof of the Central Limit Theorem using characteristic functions in which the main steps are: Set up: Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be a sequence of iid random variables with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Let $Y_i=\frac{X_i-\mu}{\sigma}$ and $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}Y_i$. 1) Expand the characteristic function $\psi_{S_n}(t)=\psi_{Y}\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{n}}\right)^n$ 2)Taylor expand the characteristic function:
$$
\psi_{S_n}=(1+\frac{it}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbb{E}(Y)-\frac{t^2}{2n}\mathbb{E}(Y^2)+\dots)^n
$$
Which we can then truncate with a bounded function $H(t)$:
$$
\psi_{S_n}=(1+\frac{it}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbb{E}(Y)-\frac{t^2}{2n}\mathbb{E}(Y^2)+n^{-\frac{3}{2}}H(t))^n
$$
3) Using $\mathbb{E}(Y)=0$ and $\mathbb{V}(Y)=1$ we get:
$$
\psi_{S_n}=(1+-\frac{t^2}{2n}+n^{-\frac{3}{2}}H(t))^n
$$
Which if we take logs and the limit $n\to\infty$ we can show that, using 
$$
\frac{\log(1+x)}{x}\to1
$$
As $x\to 0$, we get $\log(\psi_{S_n})\to-\frac{t^2}{2}$ and then it exponate each term we recover that $\psi_{S_n}$ tends to the characteristic function of a $N(0,1)$ distribution. My question is, how do we know that $H(t)$ is bounded and will tend to zero as $n\to\infty$? I thought it had something to do with the moments of a $N(0,1)$ distribution being finite since we have $\mathbb{E}(Y)=0$ and $\mathbb{V}(Y)=1$ but I am not sure this is correct. I have tried to read papers online, but they usually just use little-o notation for this part of the proof, and don't explain how they know that we can essentially disregard this term.

2245154,Free groups - extending quasi isometry to commuting square,"Let's assume one has a finitely generated free group on $n$- generators, and two homomorphisms : $F \rightarrow F/k_1$, $F \rightarrow F/k_2)$ (for $k_i$ normal subgroup ) such that $F/k_1$ is quasi-isometric to $F/k_2$ and we have one fixed QI $G: F/k_1 \rightarrow F/k_2$. Does it mean that there is a quasi isometry $H:F \rightarrow F$ giving a commuting square up to a bounded distance ? Since $F$ is a tree it is easy to show that we can inductively find quasi isometric embedding $H:F \rightarrow F$ which gives a commuting square but is it possible to extend it somehow to full quasi isometry? Edit: We have one fixed quasi-isometry $G: F/k_1 \rightarrow F/k_2$ .
For anyone reading this post the comments are now irrelevant - I've updated it all to the post itself.
Here's how I do my lift. We will denote the lift $H$. Let's denote projection $F \rightarrow F/k_1$ with $p$ and projection $F \rightarrow F/k_2$ with $q$. We equip $F$ with standard symmetric generating set $<a_1,..a_n>$ and we fix their projection images as generating sets for $F/k_i$. Additionaly let $c_i$ be a reduced word in $ k_2$ beggining with letter $a_i$ and of minimal norm (it always can be found if $k_2$ is not trivial). $e$ denotes the neutral element. We build our lift inductively. 
Start with an injective lift of $\lbrace{ e,a_1,..,a_n \rbrace}$ and assume that $H(e) =e$ (for technical reasons and also I am specifically interested in a QI $G$ which sends neutral element to itself).
By injective I mean the following : if$ |b| < |d| $ then $|H(b)| < |H(d)|$.
Now assume we have an injective lift of elements from the ball of radius $n$ -$B(e,n) = \lbrace{ d \in F : |d| \le n \rbrace}$. Take any vertex $v$ of norm $n$  - we will describe lifting of elements $\gamma \in F$ such that $|\gamma^{-1} \cdot v| =1 $ and $|\gamma| > |v|$ (i.e. vertices which share one edge with $v$ but are further from the neutral element). Let's denote such vertices $\gamma_1,..,\gamma_{n-1}$. $G$ is a QI hence $d_{F/k_2}(G(p(v)),G(p(\gamma_{i})) \le K $ for some uniform constant $K$. As a result $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i)) = q(a_{i_{1}}) \cdot ... \cdot q(a_{i_{k_{i}}})$ for $i = \lbrace{1,..,n-1 \rbrace}$ and for all $i$ we have that $ i_{k_{i}} \le K$.( it is the definition of the word metric $G(p(v))^{-1} \cdot G(p(\gamma_i))$ can be written as a word shorter then $K$ but for each $i$ word's letters and its lenght may differ -but we know they are uniformly bounded!). Since we have a lift of $v$  - denoted $H(v)$ , we can lift $\gamma_i$ to $H(\gamma_i) = H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$. So far the choice of $c_{j_{i}}$ may be arbitrary - the lift will give us commuting square and will be coarse Lipschitz. But it should additionaly be QI embedding hence we choose $c_{j_{i}}$ in a special way - forcing the lifts to ""spread"". For given $i$ we choose $c_{j_{i}}$  in such a way that: i) $j_i \neq i_{k_{i}}$ hence word $ H(v) \cdot a_{i_{1}} \cdot ... \cdot a_{i_{k_{i}}} \cdot c_{j_{i}}$ is a reduced word. ii) we choose them in such a way that if $G(p(\gamma_m)) = G(p(\gamma_r)) $ then $c_{j_{m}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ hence lifts $H(\gamma_m),H(\gamma_r$ separate at vertex $H(v)$ iii) and we even choose them so that $c_{j_{i}} \neq c_{j_{r}}$ if $ i \neq r$. Such choices can obviously be made. It ends the construction. Now let's take any two points $u,t \in F$ such that $d(u,t) = n$ it means that they are connected by a unique shortest path $d_0,..,d_n$ such that $d_0 = u,d_n =t$ and $d(d_i,d_{i+1})=1$. This path divides into two parts: $d_0,...,d_{s},d_{s+1},..,d_n$ For $i \le s $ $|d_{i}| <|d_{i-1}|$ and for $i \ge s $ we have that $|d_{i+1}| >|d_{i}|$ . The lift of the first part of the path path gives us path $H(d_0),..,H(d_s)$ such that $1 \le d(H(d_i),H(d_{i+1})) \le K'$ ($K'$ is a little bit bigger then $K$ because we have added $c_j$'s but nonetheless it is uniform. Now the very construction of the lift assures us that $ H(d_{i})$ lies in the complement of $F - H(d_{i+1})$ which does not contain lift of neutral element - $H(e)$ hence If you take the shortest path connecting $H(d_0),H(d_s)$ - $f_0,..,f_k$ ($d(f_j,f_{j+1}) =1$) then $H(d_i) $ lay on this path and if $ f_{j}$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_i)$ and $ f_l$ is a vertex equal to $H(d_{i+1})$ then $ l > j$ which means that $ d(H(d_0),H(d_s)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot s = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_0,d_s)$ ( informally speaking path $H(d_0,...,H(d_s)$ always flows forward from $H(e)$, never backwards
) We can conduct the same reasoning with the second part - $d_s,...,d_n$ - hence $ d(H(d_s),H(d_n)) = k \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot (n-s) = \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot d(d_s,d_n)$ All that is left is to analyse the critical three points - $d_{s-1},d_{s},d_{s+1}$. We know that $|H(d_{s-1})| < |H(d_{s})| $ and that $ |H(d_{s+1}) < |H(d_{s})| $ But we chose $c_j$ in such a way that points $ H(d_{s-1}),H(d_{s}),H(d_{s+1})$ do not belong to one geodesic (. Hence if $r_0,..,r_m$ is the shortest path connecting $d_{s-1}$ with $d_{s+1}$  then $1 \le m \le K' $ hence path $H(d_0),..,H(d_s),r_0,..,r_m,H(d_{s+1}),..,H(d_n)$ is path joining $H(d_0)$ with $H(d_n)$ and it only ""flows"" in one direction hence $d(H(d_0),H(d_n)) \ge \frac{1}{M+1} \cdot (s + n-s) $","['geometric-group-theory', 'trees', 'group-theory', 'free-groups']"

2245340,Probability that sum of squares of two integers is divisible by $10$,"I came across this question a few days ago and have been trying to find the right answer since.

These unit places can be set up in infinite number of $x$'s and $y$'s. The answer, though, I am sure won't be much of a vague figure like infinity. So, I assumed two possible solutions- either the numbers must be having a pattern to form them into an infinite sequence, or a far suitable answer from this point that I find is finding the probability for a general- n terms.

2245383,"Derivatives of the Lagrangian $L=L(x, \dot x , t)$","Let me say I consider this a mathematics post, not a physics one -- correct me if I'm wrong. In Lagrangian Mechanics we consider the Lagrangian function, which is a function of the position, the velocity and time $L(x, \dot x,t)$. In arbitrary coordinates it has the form $L= L (q, \dot q,t) $ (where $q$ is a vector if we have a problem in $2$ or $3$ dimensions). Suppose we change the coordinate system to $q'=f(q,t)$ so that $\dot {q'}={\partial f \over \partial q} \dot q + {\partial f \over \partial t}$. Then we get a new Lagrangian by $$L'\left(q', \dot q',t\right)=  L'\left(f(q,t),{\partial f \over \partial q} \dot q + {\partial f \over \partial t},t\right) = L(q,\dot q,t).$$ We know these two Lagrangians describe the same system, when the Euler-Lagrange equations are implemented on them (a bit a grammar issue here maybe- sorry). These two functions are different, but for a given time $t$, their values coincide. I want to show that $$ {d \over dt} \left({ \partial L \over \partial{\dot q}}\right) - {\partial L \over \partial q} = {\partial f \over \partial q} \left[ {d \over dt} \left( { \partial L' \over \partial{ \dot q'}}\right) -{ \partial L' \over \partial q'}\right] \space \space (1)$$

If $n$ divides $m$, prove that $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$. Showing that a finite abelian group has a subgroup of order m for each divisor m of n I think I found a clearer way of doing that, and I would like to share it and have it ""peer-reviewed"". Lemma: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $m$. Then $\forall g\in G$, $g^m=1$. Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $m$, such that $n\mid m$. Let $g\in G$ be an element of $G$ with (finite) order $O(g)=r$. Since $g\in G$, then $\langle g\rangle\le G$. By Lagrange's Theorem, then $r\mid m$; then let $m=kr$ for a certain $k$. Thus: $$g^m=g^{kr}=(g^r)^k=(g^k)^r=1^r=1$$ Proposition: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $m$. If $n\mid m$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $n$. If $n\mid m$, let $m=kn$ for a certain $k$. Then for every $g\in G$ (with $g \ne e$, $e$ the identity element of $G$):
$$g^m=g^{kn}=1\implies (g^k)^n=1$$ Thus with $h=g^k$, we have $h^n=1$; so the subgroup generated by $h=g^k$ has order $n$. What do people think about this proof? Does it contain any flaws or holes?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'abelian-groups', 'group-theory']"

Where the paradox is formulated by considering one person’s odds when choosing to swap an envelope, my question is whether the paradox might be resolved by considering the paradox from both swapper’s perspective instead of just one (i.e. for one person to swap, there must be another person for the original to swap with). From a single person’s perspective, the paradoxical odds are traditionally given by the equation:
$$0.5( \,0.5x) \, + 0.5( \,2x) \, = 1.25x$$
To incorporate a two-person perspective, the equation would be [what one person stands to gain] less [what they stand to lose = what their opponent stands to gain]:
$$[ \,0.5( \,0.5x) \, + 0.5( \,2x) \,] \, - [ \,0.5( \,0.5x) \, + 0.5( \,2x) \,] \, = 0$$

2246188,Trying to determine equivalence of two definitions of multiplication for integers modulo $n$,"Consider an integer modulo $n$, defined in terms of the following coset of the integer group with addition operation, for a coset representative $a$:
$$\overline{a} = \{a + k n \, | \, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$ We define $\overline{b}$ similarly, where $a, b < n$. Multiplication is defined in this way: $\overline{a} \cdot \overline{b} \equiv \overline{a b}$, where the latter $a b$ employs the usual integer multiplication (I use $\equiv$ to mean ""is defined as""). See for example Dummit & Foote, Preliminaries section. I wanted to check if this is equivalent to the following definition (I don't think it is in general, but am having trouble showing whether it is or it isn't):
$$\overline{a} * \overline{b} \equiv \{xy \, | \, x \in \overline{a}, y \in \overline{b}\}$$ If you write out my second proposed definition explicitly for the set members, you'll see that whether it is equivalent seems to rest on whether the following equation has integer solutions $(k,l)$ for all $N \in \mathbb{Z}$:
$$ a l + b k + n k l = N$$ Whether this has integer solutions for all $N$ determines whether the resulting set is equal to the coset $\overline{a b}$ that results from the first (standard) definition. This looks like a nonlinear diophantine equation or the like, which I haven't dealt with before. I feel like I'm overthinking this or am missing something. Edit : It was requested that I show how I obtained the equation and why it must have solutions for all $N$. From my definition of $*$, we have: $$
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{a}*\overline{b} &\equiv& \{x y \, | x \in \overline{a}, y \in \overline{b}\} \\
&=& \{ (a + kn)(b + l n) \, | \, k,l \in \mathbb{Z} \} \\
&=& \{ ab + (a l + b k + n k l) n \, | \, k,l \in \mathbb{Z} \} \\
\end{eqnarray}
$$ If the definitions are equivalent, the set in the last equality must be the same as $\{ab+Nn \, | \, N \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. For this to be true, $a l + b k + n k l$ must span all the integers just as $N$ does. So, $a l + b k + n k l$ must be surjective on $\mathbb{Z}$, and therefore $a l + b k + n k l = N$ must have integer solutions $(k,l)$ for all integers $N$. Recall that $a$, $b$, and $n$ are all fixed.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

Are well known some conjectures about primes, you can a very good summary is this Conjecture 78 from Carlos Rivera website The prime puzzles & problems connection . Sometimes when I know a new conjecture from this or a different source I do the following exercise illustrated in this example Example 1. Let the Firoozbakht's conjecture, see it in this Wikipedia , then exponentiating such inequality I can define a sequence ( OEIS A182519 )
of integers $a(n):=a_n$, for $n>1$, such that $$a_n+p_{n+1}^n=p_{n}^{n+1}$$ and each of such triples $(a(n),p_{n+1}^n,p_{n}^{n+1})$ satisfies $\gcd(a(n),p_{n+1}^n,p_{n}^{n+1})=1$. Thus I can to combine with the abc conjecture, I say the version abc Conjecture II from this Wikipedia , to state that $\forall ε>0$ there exists a constant $K_ε$ such that for all such triples ($n>1$) $$p_{n}^{n+1}\leq K_ε\cdot (p_n p_{n+1})^{1+ε}\left(\operatorname{rad}(a_n)\right)^{1+ε}.$$ Example 2. Similarly one can do calculations for Reza's conjecture (Reza Farhadian, Lorestan Univesity) and the abc Conjecture to conclude that $\forall ε>0$ there exists a constant $C_ε$ such that for all  triples that one can defines easily from Reza's inequality ($n>4$) $$n^{p_n^{n+1}}=\left(n^{p_n}\right)^{p_n^n}\leq C_ε\cdot \left(\operatorname{rad}(np_n a_n )\right)^{1+ε}$$ ( Here a mistake was fixed. ) when we presume (I don't know if the following hypothesis is superfluous, I know that $\gcd(n,p_n)=1$)) $$\gcd(a(n),n,p_n)=1.$$ Question. I would like to know from a divulgative viewpoint, that is heuristics or your ideas, reasonings... about if such idea to combine a conjecture about primes of this kind and the abc conjecture is potentially useful to deduce interesting statements about primes.

2246270,What is the average?,"When I was first introduced to the concept of average (mean), I was confused. What does average mean? How does one number $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$ represent the ""central tendency"" of a set of data points $a_i$. Then I found a way to deal with this concept. I thought that the average (mean) is ""the closest to all the data points at the same time"". Now, I want to prove this. Concisely: Let $f$ $:$ $\Bbb{R}$$\to$$\Bbb{R}$ be defined by: $$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}|x-a_i|$$ To prove: $f(x)$ hits a minimum at $x=\bar a$, where $\bar a$ is the mean of the discrete data points $a_i$. This would mean that the sum of the distances of the mean from the various data points is minimum as compared to any other number. My attempt: Clearly $f(x)$ is continuous since it is a sum of continuous functions and piece-wise differentiable since it is a sum of such functions. So, I find $f'(x)$. Before that, let's assume $a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_n$ [clearly, no loss of generality, here]: $$
f'(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
-n, & \text {$x<a_1$} \\ 
-n+2, & \text{$a_1<x<a_2$} \\
-n+4, & \text{$a_2<x<a_3$} \\

. & . \\
-n+2n = n, & \text{$x>a_n$} \\

$$ Now, the problem arises: $f'(x)=0$ has no solutions for $n$ is odd. For n is even, it has the solution as an entire interval: $$x \in (a_{n/2},a_{n/2+1})$$ This means i failed, my intuition was wrong from the very beginning. It can be proven [i think] that for $n$ is even, $\bar a$ lies in the above interval, but still: It means that there are more real numbers that are as much the ""mean"" of the data points as the mean itself [if my ""definition"" was right]. So, two questions: Why was my intuition wrong? Which intuition is right for averages (mean)?","['derivatives', 'means', 'summation', 'average']"

Once we show it, we can proceed to show $T_1S^2$, the unit tangent bundle, being obviously a continuous image of $TS^2$ by a normalisation map must be connected too, and again its image under the determinant map $\det$ must also be connected and hence can only be the singleton $\{1\}$. But how to show $TS^2$ is connected in the first place which might be much harder?","['differential-geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'orthonormal', 'determinant']"

prove $f$ is identically zero. Give two proofs of this result. I am learning Fourier series. I can only give one proof.

$$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\|f-S_n\|=0,$$ where $S_n$ is the Fourier series of $f$. This implies 
$$\frac{1}{\pi}\|f\|_{L^2}=\frac{a_0^2}{2}+\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(a_k^2+b_k^2)=0.$$ So, $f=0$. However, I cannot give another proof using the theorems of Fourier series.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis']"
2246778,Cohomology--What Is Going on with the Geometry?,"This question is pretty open-ended, so I'm expecting that some intuitions and potentially even straight up philosophies of (Cech) cohomology will be popping up here. We've started doing cohomology in my alg. geo. class (and I've been studying the stuff solo for a little while now), and we computed
$H^0(X,\mathcal{F}) = \mathcal{F}(X)$, which is all well and good. So the $0^{\text{th}}$ cohomology group of an arbitrary sheaf of Abelian groups on a scheme (or, I imagine, a topological space) $X$ is just the group of global sections of that sheaf. Neat. I have also seen (and proved for myself) the familiar fact that
$H^1(X,\mathscr{O}_X^*)\cong \text{Pic}(X)$ where $\text{Pic}(X)$ denotes the set of isomorphism classes of line bundles on $X$. (Again, $X$ here is an arbitrary scheme.) So we can identify isomorphism classes of line bundles, isomorphism classes of divisors, and the first cohomology group of the sheaf of nowhere vanishing regular functions on $X$. Also cool; there is some geometry happening there with line bundles and such. My question, then, is what other (classical) geometric information is contained in cohomology? For instance, my prof is having us compute $H^1(\mathbb{P}_A^1,\mathscr{O}_{\mathbb{P}_A^1}(n))$ for an arbitrary commutative ring with unity, $A$. Again, I can understand how this cohomology group contains the idea of ""how easy it is to pick local sections on an (the canonical) affine cover of $\mathbb{P}_A^1$ which don't glue to a global section on the entire space."" Is there anything else latent in this computation which I'm not seeing because of just trying to do all the algebra? Update Jul, 2018: I'm still hoping for more answers and ideas about this question, maybe some things from category theory/homological algebra, or the relevance of cohomology particularly in arithmetic geometry and maybe some relationship with Galois groups, etc.","['homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2246805,Example II.$3.2.6$ in Hartshorne (reduced induced closed subscheme structure),"Consider a scheme $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ and a closed subset $Y$ of $X$. Let $X = \bigcup U_i, \, U_i \cong \operatorname{Spec}(A_i)$ be an open affine covering of $X$ and let $Y_i = U_i \cap Y$. Then $Y_i$ is closed in $U_i$ and it can be endowed with a closed subscheme structure via the ring epimorphism $A_i \rightarrow A_i / a_i$, where $a_i = \bigcap_{P \in\operatorname{Spec}(A_i) \cap Y} P$. Notice that $a_i$ is radical and so $A_i/a_i$ is reduced. This construction endows each $Y_i$ with a sheaf $\mathcal{F}_i$ of reduced rings. Notice that the $Y_i$ form an open covering of $Y$. Thus we want to glue the $\mathcal{F}_i$ to get a reduced sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ on $Y$. For this, and in view of exercise II.$1.22$, we want to demonstrate isomorphisms $\phi_{ij}: \mathcal{F}_i|_{Y_i \cap Y_j} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}_j|_{Y_i \cap Y_j}$ as well as that the cocycle condition $\phi_{ik} = \phi_{jk} \circ \phi_{ij}$ holds on $Y_i \cap Y_j \cap Y_k$. Hartshorne says that this task can be reduced to the following: given affine open $U= \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $f \in A$, show that the reduced structure on $D(f) \cap Y$ induced by the restriction of the reduced structure on $\operatorname{Spec}(A) \cap Y$ is the same as the reduced structure on $\operatorname{Spec}(A_f) \cap Y$. Can somebody please explain what exactly is the argument that leads to this reduction?",['algebraic-geometry']
2246810,Is there a natural Zariski topology on a general finite dimensional vector space?,"General question: Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space. It is clear that $V\cong \mathbb{F}^{\dim V}=\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb F}^{\dim V}$, and so you might want to give $V$ a Zariski topology based on the linear isomorphism (or equivalently, the basis of $V$). Is there a genral way to do that? The problem, as I see it, is that you can have many different isomorphisms and therefore different topologies. Specific Question: I'm reading about lie groups $G$, their associated lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, and the exterior algebra $\Lambda^d(\mathfrak{g})$ for some $d\leq \dim \mathfrak{g}$.

2246847,What are the sheaves in the $G$-equivariant resolutions seen as vector bundles?,"$\newcommand{\F}{\mathcal{F}}$
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a $G$-equivariant sheaf over a smooth projective $G$-variety $X$, generated by global sections $s_1,...s_n$.  One can construct the first locally free sheaf $\F_1$ in the resolution of $\F$.  The sheaf is $\F_1=\Gamma(X, \F)$.  It is defined as $\Gamma(X, \F)(U)=\rho_{U,X} \Gamma(X,\F)$. (I am trying to simplify a construction given in Ginzburg's Representation Theory and Complex Geometry page 241 ) Since this sheaf is supposed to be locally free, what is the vector bundle over $X$ such that the sheaf of sections is $\F_1$?  In other words what is the vector bundle that corresponds to $\F_1$? My first guess would have been $\epsilon^n$.  This has the same global sections.  But unfortunately, it has different sections over any open.  In fact the space of sections over any open set in $X$ is going to be infinite dimensional whereas $\F_1$ has a finite dimensional (in fact with dimension less than $n$) space of sections over any open.","['algebraic-k-theory', 'sheaf-theory', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

My conjecture is the following: If $X$ is regular, then $X=\operatorname{Spec} O_L$ for a finite extension $L|K$ If $X$ is not regular then it is a spectrum of an order (not maximal) of $L$. Here $L$ is still a finite extension of $K$. Is it true? In the linked question the OP accepted an incomplete answer, and  now I'm curious. Edit: As suggested in the comments, the question can be rephrased in the following way. Let $A$ be a finite $O_K$-algebra wich is also an integral domain and such that $\operatorname{Frac}(A)=L$. Is it true that $A$ is an order of $L$? Of course we have that $A$ is integral over $\mathbb Z$, so $A\subseteq O_L$. It remains to show that $A$ contains an integral $\mathbb Z$-basis of length $[L:\mathbb Q]$.
