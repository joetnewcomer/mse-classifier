1558362,Connection between L²-norm of function and its moment-sequence,"Let $f: [0,1] \to \mathbb R$ be a continuous function and define $m_i := \int_0^1 f(x)x^i dx$. I want to somehow formalize and then show the following: If the sequence $(m_i)$ has a very small $\ell^2$-norm, then the $L^2$-norm of $f$ is also very small. More formally, let $(M_n)$ be a sequence of moment sequences $(m_i)$ with the property that the $\ell^2$-norms of $M_n$ converge to zero. Does the corresponding sequence of real functions then converge to zero in $L^2$? Unfortunately I do not have any idea how to approach this problem.

1558403,Degree of a differential equation doubt,"What should be the degree of this differential equation 1 or 2 
$$\frac{d^2x}{dy^2}+\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dx}{dy}\right)^3}=0$$ As per definition: 
the degree of a differential equation is the power of highest differential coefficient, which appearing in the given equation, when the differential coefficients are free from radicals and fractions. 
So I think I should remove the radical in the equation above and the degree will be 2.

1558547,Coordinate-free definition of elementary divisors,"There is a general mantra in math which says that what is independent of bases shall be defined independent of bases. Well, it is well known that the elementary divisors of a linear map $M\xrightarrow{\ \ f\ \ }N$ of finitely generated free modules over a principal ideal domain $R$ are independent of bases. So I wonder whether there is a simple definition, which does not mention chosen bases of $M$ and $N$. Perhaps such a characterization would help to make the theory more streamlined. Of course it should be possible to prove that given elementary divisors $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_s$ of $f$ there are bases of $M$ and $N$ such that the corresponding matrix of $f$ has Smith normal form whose entries are precisely the $\alpha_i$ and conversely that given bases such that the corresponding matrix has Smith normal form, its entries are elementary divisors.","['modules', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"
1558589,Turning a geometric vector bundle into a free $\mathscr{O}_X$-module,"Given a geometric vector bundle $V\to X$ on a scheme $X$, consider the sheaf of sections $\mathscr{I}(V/X)$ defined by $U\mapsto \operatorname{Hom}_U(U,V_{|U})$. The goal is to equip the sheaf of abelian groups $\mathscr{I}(V/X)$ an $\mathscr{O}_X$-module structure. The idea is clear, take a trivializing affine cover $\{U_i = \operatorname{Spec} R_i\}$ of $X$. Over each $U_i$, we have 
$$
\mathscr{I}(V/X)(U) = \operatorname{Hom}_{U_i}(U_i,V_{|U_i}) \cong \operatorname{Hom}_{U_i}(U_i, \mathbb{A}_{U_i}^n) = \mathscr{O}_{X|U_i}^n

The problem is over the intersections $U_{ij} = U_i\cap U_j$, the two trivializing isomorphisms coming from $U_i$ and from $U_j$ give two distinct but isomorphic $\mathscr{O}_{X|U_{ij}}$-module structures on the same abelian group $\mathscr{I}(V/X)(U_{ij})$.

1558734,Different Approaches for Introducing Elementary Functions,"Motivation We all get familiar with elementary functions in high-school or college. However, as the system of learning is not that much integrated we have learned them in different ways and the connections between these ways are not clarified mostly by teachers. Once I read the calculus book by Apostol, I just found out that one can define these functions in a treatise systematic way only analytically . The approach used in the book with some minor changes is like this $1.$ Firstly, introduce the natural logarithm function by $\ln(x)=\int_{1}^{x}\frac{1}{t}dt$ for $x>0$. Accordingly, one defines the logarithm function by $\log_{b}x=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$ for $b>0$, $b \ne 1$ and $x>0$. $2.$ Then introduce the natural exponential function as the inverse of natural logarithm $\exp(x)=\ln^{-1}(x)$. Afterwards, introduce the exponential function $a^x=\exp(x\ln(a))$ for $a>0$ and real $x$. Interchanging $x$ and $a$, one can introduce the power function $x^a=\exp(a\ln(x))$ for $x \gt 0$ and real $a$. $3.$ Next, define hyperbolic functions $\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$ by using exponential function $$\matrix{
   {\cosh (x) = {{\exp (x) + \exp ( - x)} \over 2}} \hfill & {\sinh (x) = {{\exp (x) - \exp ( - x)} \over 2}} \hfill  \cr 
 } $$ and then defining the other hyperbolic functions. Consequently, one can define the inverse-hyperbolic functions. $4.$ Finally, the author gives three ways for introducing the trigonometric functions. $\qquad 4.1-$ Introduces the $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ functions by the following properties \begin{align*}{}
\text{(a)}\,\,& \text{The domain of $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ is $\mathbb R$} \\
\text{(b)}\,\,& \cos 0 = \sin \frac{\pi}{2}=0,\, \cos \pi=-1 \\
\text{(c)}\,\,& \cos (y-x)= \cos y \cos x + \sin y \sin x \\
\text{(d)}\,\,& \text{For $0 \le x \le \frac{\pi}{2}$ we have $0 \le \cos x \le \frac{\sin x}{x} \le \frac{1}{\cos x}$}
\end{align*} $\qquad 4.2-$ Using formal geometric definitions employing the unit circle. $\qquad 4.3-$ Introducing $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ functions by their Taylor series. and then defining the other trigonometric ones and the inverse-trigonometric functions. In my point of view, the approach is good but it seems a little disconnected as the relation between the trigonometric and exponential functions is not illustrated as the author insisted to stay in the real domain when introducing these functions. Also, exponential and power functions are just defined for positive real numbers $a$ and $x$ while they can be extended to negative ones. Questions $1.$ How many other approaches are used for this purpose? Are there many or just a few? Is there some list for this? $2.$ Would you please explain just one of the other heuristic ways to introduce the elementary functions analytically with appropriate details? Notes Historical remarks are welcome as they provide a good motivation. Answers which connect more advanced (not too elementary) mathematical concepts to the development of elementary functions are really welcome. As nice example of this is the answer by Aloizio Macedo given below. It is hard to choose the best answer between these nice answers so I decided to choose none. I just gave the bounties to the ones that are more compatible with the studies from high-school. However, please feel free to add new answers including your own ideas or what you may think that is interesting so we can have a valuable list of different approaches recorded here. This can serve as a nice guide for future readers. Useful Links Here is a link to a paper by W. F. Eberlein suggested in the comments. The paper deals with introducing the trigonometric functions in a systematic way. There are six pdfs created by Paramanand Singh who has an answer below. It discusses some approaches for introducing logarithmic, exponential and circular functions. I have combined them all into one pdf which can be downloaded from here . I am sure that it will be useful.","['elementary-functions', 'real-analysis', 'big-list', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Find all positive integers $(a,b)$ for which $(a+b)^2+4ab$ and $a^2+b^2$ are both squares.

1558907,"A fence of $y$ ft is $x$ ft from a wall, find shortest ladder using trigonometry","A fence $y$ ft high is $x$ ft from a wall. Find the length of the
  shortest ladder that will rest with one end on the ground and the
  other end on the wall. This is a classic problem that is expected to be solved with trigonometry but I can't seem to get the right answer. First, let the angle between the ground and the ladder be $\theta$, I express the total length of the ladder $L$ as the sum of the length between the ground and the fence $l_1$ and the length between the fence and the wall $l_2$: $$
l_1 = \frac{y}{\sin\theta} \\
l_2 = \frac{x}{\cos\theta} \\
L = l_1 + l_2 = \frac{y}{\sin\theta} + \frac{x}{\cos\theta} = y\csc\theta + x\sec\theta \\
$$ Then, since this is an optimization problem, I differentiate the length: $$
L' = -y\csc\theta\cot\theta + x\sec\theta\tan\theta = \frac{-y\cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} + \frac{x\sin\theta}{\cos^2\theta} \\
$$ With this equation, I find the critical point where the derivative is zero: $$
\frac{y\cos\theta}{\sin^2\theta} = \frac{x\sin\theta}{\cos^2\theta} \\
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin^3\theta}{\cos^3\theta} = \tan^3\theta \\
$$ Now I make the assumption that $tan\theta = (y/x)^{1/3}$ which I then proceed to replace in the equation for the length of the ladder: $$
L = \frac{y\cos\theta}{\sin\theta\cos\theta} + \frac{x\sin\theta}{\cos\theta\sin\theta} = \frac{y}{\cos\theta\tan\theta} + \frac{x\tan\theta}{sin\theta} \\
L = \frac{y}{\cos\theta(y/x)^{1/3}} + \frac{x(y/x)^{1/3}}{\sin\theta} = \frac{y^{2/3}x^{1/3}}{\cos\theta} + \frac{x^{2/3}y^{1/3}}{\sin\theta}
$$ Finally I make another assumption that $sin\theta = y^{1/3}$ and $cos\theta = x^{1/3}$ because $tan\theta = (\sin\theta/\cos\theta) = (y/x)^{1/3}$: $$
L = \frac{y^{2/3}x^{1/3}}{x^{1/3}} + \frac{x^{2/3}y^{1/3}}{y^{1/3}} = y^{2/3} + x^{2/3}

EDIT #2: My understanding on how to approach integration of a complex function with one branch cut is clear, and I state this very boldly, I feel like I understand it intuitively(keeping the Riemann surfaces in mind). I am also very comfortable with recognizing when a function has multiple branch cuts, realizing why they are there, and that we must avoid them in order for the domain to stay simply connected. What I don't understand, is how to integrate along a branch cut which isn't necessarily along the real axis(e.g. along the line $\phi=\frac{\pi}{3}$. In the question linked, this paragraph confuses me : The reader should note that there is a fourfold split here: when $z$ is to the left or right of the imaginary axis, and when $z$ is above or below the real axis. In each of these cases, the log has a negative argument, but the log of the negative argument takes on a different value along each section of the dog-bone.
  When $z$ is to the left and right of the imaginary axis we respectively parametrize $z=+iy$and $z=-iy$. However, we subtract $2i\pi$ from the log term upon crossing the imaginary axis and add $2i\pi$  upon crossing the real axis.","['complex-analysis', 'complex-integration', 'branch-cuts']"

where $[k,n]$ and $(k,n)$ are the least common multiple resp. the greatest common divisor of $k$ and $n$, then $n$ is square-free. I started with tackling the sum:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}[k,n]^{(k,n)}=\sum_{d|n}\sum_{1≤k≤n,\space (k,n)=d}{\left(\frac{kn}{d}\right)^d}=\sum_{d|n}n^d\sum_{1≤k≤\frac{n}{d},\space \left(k,\frac{n}{d}\right)=1}{k^d}=\sum_{d|n}n^d\varphi_{d}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n}[k,n]^{(k,n)}=\sum_{d|n}n^d\varphi_{d}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\equiv n\varphi_1(n) \space \mod{n^3}$$
and for $n$ even:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}[k,n]^{(k,n)}=\sum_{d|n}n^d\varphi_{d}\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\equiv n\varphi_1(n)+n^2\varphi_2\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) \space \mod{n^3}

Furthermore:
$$
\varphi_1(n)=\sum_{1≤k≤n, \space (k,n)=1}k=\sum_{1≤k≤n, \space (k,n)=1}n-k\implies\\
2\varphi_1(n)=\sum_{1≤k≤n, \space (k,n)=1}n=n\varphi(n)\implies \varphi_1(n)=\frac{n\varphi(n)}{2}

So we can see for $n$ odd:

and $n$ even:

Define the Hartogs regularity radius $R(z)$ of the series
  \begin{equation}
\sum_{v=0}^{\infty}f_{v}(z)w^{v}, w\in\mathbb{C},

  by setting $R(z)$ equal to the radius of convergence of the above in $w$. Prove that $-\log R(z)$ is subharmonic on $D$. (This is fundamental result of Hartogs, which is at the core of Oka's Theorem 5.6.) My attempt Note that, explicitly,
$$
R(z)=\frac{1}{\limsup_{v\to\infty}\sqrt[v]{|f_{v}(z)|}}
$$
so
\begin{equation}
-\log R(z)=\log\left(\limsup_{v\to\infty}\sqrt[v]{|f_v(z)|}\right).

$$
\lim_{j\to\infty}\sqrt[v_j]{|f_{v_j}(z)|}=\limsup_{v\to\infty}\sqrt[v]{|f_{v}(z)|}

and define a sequence
$$
u_j(z):=\log\left(|f_{v_j}(z)|^{1/v_j}\right).

Clearly $\lim_{j\to\infty}u=-\log R(z)$, and (as has been shown) each $\log|f_{v_j}(z)|$ is subharmonic. Hence each
$
u_j(z)=\tfrac{1}{v_j}\log |f_{v_j}|
$
is subharmonic. From here, I would like this show that this implies the limit function is subharmonic, but I don't know how to go about it. One way I know could do it by showing the sequence $\{u_j\}$ is decreasing, but I don't believe this is the case. Also, this is the first exercise in the set for this section, so I feel as though there might be a significantly easier way. If anyone has any hints/tips on how to repair this argument or possibly have an idea on a simpler one, it would be a huge help. Thanks in advance.","['complex-analysis', 'harmonic-functions']"
1560408,Which functions are derivatives of some other function?,"There is a fundamental formula in integral calculus which states that $\int_a^bF'(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$. This formula gives a connection between definite and indefinite integrals. There are plenty of functions which are integrable (in the definite sense)-for example each bounded measurable function is ok. However I don't know precisely which functions do have indefinite integral: in other words which functions are derivatives of some other function?
For example continuity is enough: on the other hand one cas show that each function being the derivative (although need not to be continuous) has the Darboux property. So my question is Which functions are derivatives of some other function?","['real-analysis', 'integration']"
1560411,Basis for the intersection of two integer lattices,"If $B_1$ and $B_2$ are the bases of two integer lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$, i.e. $L_1=\{B_1n:n\in\mathbb Z^d\}$ and $L_2=\{B_2n:n\in\mathbb Z^d\}$, is there an easy way to determine a basis for $L_1\cap L_2$? Answers of the form ""Plug the matrices into a computer and ask for Hermite Normal Form, etc"" are perfectly acceptable as this is a practical problem and the matrices of integers $B_1$ and $B_2$ are known, but I need some algorithmic way because the procedure will be repeated many times.","['integer-lattices', 'linear-algebra']"
1560434,How can I determine B-inverse from an optimal tableau of a LP?,"(This is NOT a homework question, I am reviewing for my upcoming exam) Given this linear program: and this optimal tableau: I am attempting to determine $B$ inverse using the table above. From the table I know that my basic variables are $x_1$, $x_2$ and $e_2$. I previously believed that $B$ inverse could simply be read from the optimal tableau as the values for your non basic variables. Therefore I originally thought $B$ inverse was the columns (excluding the first row) of $s_3$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ in the table above. The columns of my BVs from my original equation (and therefore the value for B) is: \begin{bmatrix}1&2&0\\1&-1&-1\\2&1&0\end{bmatrix} and if I find the inverse of $B$ myself I get: \begin{bmatrix}-1/3&0&2/3\\2/3&0&-1/3\\-1&-1&1\end{bmatrix} However this does not match the entries for my non basic variables in the table. Not only are the last two columns flipped, but the last row also has the wrong signs. I presume the problem is that $x_1$, $x_2$ and $e_2$ in the final solution do not form the identity matrix, and possibly because $e_2$ is an excess variable and not a slack variable, however I can't be certain as my textbook only has an example where in the optimal solution, the BVs columns form the identity matrix and there are only slack variables. Is it possible to read $B$ inverse from the optimal table in such a question?","['matrices', 'simplex', 'linear-programming', 'inverse']"
1560471,Group Theory: Show that $G/Z(G) \cong \operatorname{Inn}(G) $?,"Here is the question. It's rather long so I apologise. ""Let $G$ be a group. Let $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ be the set of all isomorphisms of $G$ . This is a group under composition, known as the group of automorphisms of $G$ . If $g \in G$ then we know that the map $\theta_{g}:G \rightarrow G$ defined by $\theta_g(a)=g^{-1}ag$ is an isomorphism."" Questions I have answered. 1) Show that if $g,h \in G$ then $\theta_{gh} = \theta_{h} \circ \theta_{g}$ . Answer: Let $ a \in G$ observe that $\theta_{gh}(a)= (gh)^{-1}a(gh) = h^{-1}g^{-1}agh = h^{-1}\theta_g(a)h=\theta_h(\theta_g(a))=(\theta_h \circ \theta_g)(a)$ . This is true $\forall a \in G \space \space \therefore\space \space \theta_{gh} = \theta_{h} \circ \theta_{g}$ . 2) Define a map $\phi: G \rightarrow \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ by $\phi(g)= \theta_{g^-1}$ . Show that $\phi$ is a homomorphism. Answer: We need to show that $\theta_{gh^{-1}} = \theta_{g^{-1}} \circ \theta_{h^{-1}} $ . However we know that $\theta_{gh} = \theta_h \circ \theta_g$ and therefore we can conclude that $\theta_{gh^{-1}} = \theta_{h^{-1}g^{-1}} = \theta_{g^{-1}} \circ \theta_{h^{-1}} $ . 3) Find $\ker(\phi)$ . Answer: $\theta_g(a) = g^{-1}ag \space \therefore \space \theta_{g^{-1}}(a) = gag^{-1}$ . To find $\ker(\phi)$ find $\theta_{g^{-1}}(a)=a$ so we have $gag^{-1}=a$ and then $gag^{-1}g = ag$ so we have $ga=ag$ and so $\ker(\phi)= Z(G)$ where $Z(G)$ is the centre, all the elements in the group that commute with all other elements in the group. And finally, question 4: The image of $\phi$ is called $ \operatorname{Inn}(G)$ , the group of inner automorphisms. Show that $G/Z(G) \cong  \operatorname{Inn}(G)$ . I can't work out the answer to this final question. I apologise for the length, I just wanted to explain in as much detail as possible.

1560530,In need of book recommendations (Soft Question) [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 8 years ago . Improve this question I tried to label this with as many soft question labels as possible to avoid immediate downvotes. To give you a gauge of where I am math-wise, I'm a senior in high school who has gone through all the basic subjects (geometry, algebra, trigonometry, basic statistics/probability, calculus I). In addition, I've explored a few more advanced concepts on my own (mostly pertaining to calculus). For the holidays, I told my parents that I'd like some solid math books in more advanced subjects so that I can further my knowledge, but local bookstores don't have anything of that calibre. My question to you is to give me great recommendations for books on more advanced topics I'd like to begin studying (the two I listed are complex analysis and number theory). However, I'm more than open to books that will go further into geometry, trig, algebra, or calculus if they are worth the read in your mind. Additionally, books in other subjects that would give me a good start in new areas of math are completely fine. I enjoy being challenged a great deal and have yet to fail to grasp any area I've studied thus far, so don't hold back unless the book pertains to material that requires calc III, for example. If you need any additional information, just ask. Again, sorry for the soft question.","['number-theory', 'complex-analysis', 'reference-request', 'soft-question']"
1560546,How to design a closed rectangular box of minimum cost without Lagrange Multipliers,"Suppose the box is to be of volume $V_0$ cubic cm; and the cost of material for the front and back sides is $b$ dollars per square cm, $c$ dollars per square cm for the left and right two sides, and $d$ dollars per square cm for the top and bottom sides.  Note that $V_0$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are just arbitrary constants. What are the ramifications of: 1.)$b = c = d$ 2.)$b = c = 2d$ 3.)$b = 2c = 3d$ I got help here How to design a closed rectangular box of minimum cost using Lagrange Multipliers to do it using Lagrange Multipliers, but how do I do it without? Below is my attempt, but I get a discriminant of $0$ which means the test failed. $$f(x,y,z)=2bxy+2cyz+2dxz$$ $$V_0=xyz$$ $$\frac{2bV_0}{z}+\frac{2cV_0}{x}+\frac{2dV_0}{y}=0$$ Next I solved for $z$: $$z=-\frac{bx}{c}-\frac{by}{d}$$ Now I took this and plugged it back into my original equation so that it is now a function of two variables instead of three: $$f(x,y)=2bxy+2cy\left(-\frac{bx}{c}-\frac{by}{d}\right)+2dx\left(-\frac{bx}{c}-\frac{by}{d}\right)$$ I then simplified: $$-\frac{2cy^2b}{d}-\frac{2dx^b}{c}-2xby$$ I then found all of the partials: $$f_x=\frac{-4xbd}{c}-2by$$ $$f_y=\frac{-4ybc}{d}-2xb$$ $$f_{xx}=\frac{-4bd}{c}$$ $$f_{yy}=\frac{-4bc}{d}$$ $$f_{xy}=-2b$$ Finally, I found the discriminant: $$D(x,y)=\frac{-4bd}{c}\left(\frac{-4bc}{d}\right)-(-2b)^2$$ $$D(x,y)=-4\left(\frac{b^2cd}{cd}\right)+4b^2=0$$ Did I make a computational error, or am I'm doing this completely wrong?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

Show that such a knight can return to its original position only after an even number of moves. Attempt: Assume, wlog, the knight moves $q$ steps to the right after its $p$ steps. Let the valid moves for the knight be ""LU"", ""UR"", ""DL"", ""RD"" i.e. when it moves L eft, it has to go U p(""LU""), or when it goes U p , it has to go R ight(""UR"") and so on. Let the knight be stationed at $(0,0)$ . We note that after any move its coordinates will be integer multiples of $p,q$ . Let its final position be $(pk, qr)$ for $ k,r\in\mathbb{Z}$ . We follow sign conventions of coordinate system. Let knight move by $-pk$ horizontally and $-qk$ vertically by repeated application of one step. So, its new position is $(0,q(r-k))$ I am thinking that somehow I need to cancel that $q(r-k)$ to achieve $(0,0)$ , but don't be able to do the same.
