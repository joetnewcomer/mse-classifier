1391126,Why can't that be an uncountable union?,"I'm reading part of Lee's Introduction to manifolds. I have come to the following proposition. $\textbf{Proposition 14.6 (Local Structure of Integral Manifolds).}$ Let $D$ be an involutive $k$ -dimensional distribution on a smooth manifold $M$ , and let $(U,\varphi)$ be a flat chart for $D$ . If $N$ is any integral manifold of $D$ , then $N\cap U$ is a countable disjoint union of open subsets of $k$ -dimensional slices of $U$ , each of which is open in $N$ and embedded in $M$ . Proof. Because the inclusion map $\eta:N\hookrightarrow M$ is continuous, $N\cap U=\eta^{-1}(U)$ is open in $N$ , and thus consists of a countable disjoint union of connected components, each of which is open in $N$ . The proof then continues, and I will read the rest shortly. I was just wondering: why can't $\iota^{-1}(U)$ be an uncountable union of disjoint connected open components?","['differential-geometry', 'manifolds']"
1391192,Does a left group action on a principal bundle induce an action on associated vector bundles?,"Let $G\hookrightarrow P\xrightarrow{\pi}M$ be a principal $G$-bundle with right action $\cdot $ and suppose we are also given a left action $\rho: U\times P\rightarrow P$ of some group $U$  on $P$. Everything is smooth. Note that since left and right actions commute, for $u\in U$ the map $\rho_u=\rho(u, ):P\rightarrow P$ maps fibres to fibres and induces a map $\bar \rho_u$  on $M$. I am interested in the case where $\bar\rho_u$ is not the identity on $M$. If $V$ is a vector space, $\kappa$ a representation of $G$ on $V$ and $E=P\times_\kappa V$ is the associated vector bundle with projection $\pi_E$, does $\rho$ induce in any natural way an action $\hat \rho$ of $U$ on $E$ so that the map $\hat\rho_u:E\rightarrow E$ is a vector bundle map (that is $\hat\rho$ maps fibres to fibres and $\hat\rho:E|_{\pi_(p)}\rightarrow E|_{\pi_(\rho_u(p))} $ is linear) which covers $\bar\rho_u$? It seems to me that a suitable map $\hat\rho_u$ would be of the form
\begin{equation}
\hat\rho_u([p,v])=[\rho_u(p),L_u(p)v],
\end{equation}
with $L_u(p):V\rightarrow V$a linear map. In order for $\hat\rho_u$ to be well defined we need $L_u(p\cdot h)=\kappa(h)^{-1}L_u(p)\kappa(h)$. The action on the fibres of $E$ is linear and $\hat\rho_u$ maps fibres to fibres and covers $\bar\rho_u$ as
\begin{equation}
\pi_E(\hat\rho_u([p,v]))=\pi_E([\rho_u(p),v])=\pi(\rho_u(p))=\bar\rho_u(\pi(p))=\bar\rho_u(\pi_E([p,v])).
\end{equation} In general it seems to me that the only ""preferred"" choice for $L_u$ is to take $L_u(p)=\mathrm{Id}_V$ (or a multiple thereof) for all $p$, so that
\begin{equation}
\hat\rho_u([p,v])=[\rho_u(p),v].
\end{equation}
If $U$ is a subgroup of the centre of $G$ we can also take $L_u(p)=\kappa(u)$, still independent of $p$. First, am I saying anything stupid? And second, are there other natural ways of defining an induced action of $U$ on $E$ with the required properties?

1391196,Joint distribution of Brownian motion and its running maximum,"$B$ being standard Brownian motion, its running maximum is defined as $M_t = \sup_{0\leq s\leq t} B_s$. I am trying to follow the proof of the following result but I don't understand some of the steps and they are not explained in the manuscript. Let $a \leq b$ and $b > 0$ be real numbers. Then 
  $$P^0\{B_t \leq a, M_t \geq b\} = P^0\{B_t \geq 2b-a\}$$ Proof: Let $\tau = \inf\{t\geq 0: B_t = b\}$. By path continuity $\{\tau \leq t\} = \{M_t \geq b\}$. So here is my first question. Why is continuity relevant here? I understand that continuity ensures $\tau$ to be a stopping time but other than that what role does continuity play in showing $\{\tau \leq t\} = \{M_t \geq b\}$? \begin{align}P^0\{B_t(\omega) \leq a, M_t(\omega) \geq b\} ={} & P^0\{B_t(\omega) \leq a, \tau(\omega) \leq t\}\\ ={} & E^0\left[\mathbf{1}_{\{\tau(\omega)\leq t\}}P^0\{B_t \leq a\mid \mathcal{F}_{\tau}\}\right]\\={} &E^0\left[\mathbf{1}_{\{\tau(\omega)\leq t\}}P^b\{B_{t-\tau(\omega)} \leq a\}\right]\\={} &E^0\left[\mathbf{1}_{\{\tau(\omega)\leq t\}}P^b\{B_{t-\tau(\omega)} \geq 2b-a\}\right]\\={} &P^0\{B_t(\omega) \geq 2b-a, M_t(\omega) \geq b\} = P^0\{B_t(\omega) \geq 2b-a\}\end{align} I had first thought that going from the first line to the second one was done as follows.
$$P^0\{B_t(\omega) \leq a, \tau(\omega) \leq t\} = E^0\left[E^0[\mathbf{1}_{\{\tau(\omega)\leq t\}}\mathbf{1}_{\{B_t \leq a\}}\mid \mathcal{F}_{\tau}]\right]$$
But $\{\tau(\omega)\leq t\}$ is contained in $\mathcal{F}_t$, not in $\mathcal{F}_{\tau}$. So it cannot just be moved out of the inner expectation. The third and the fourth lines come from the strong Markov property and the reflection principle, respectively. That I get. But I am lost again in the fifth line. How are the probabilities put back together? The RHS of the last line is clear to me by the way. I am talking about the LHS.","['probability-theory', 'brownian-motion', 'markov-process', 'stochastic-processes']"

Show that $$\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{a_i}{1-a_i}\leq\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{b_i}{1-b_i}$$. I have been unable to make any substantial progress. I've noticed that $\sum b_i=1$ also. Letting $A_n=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{a_i}{1-a_i}$, $B_n=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{b_i}{1-b_i}$,  both $A_n$ and $B_n$ are greater than one, and more precisely $B_n\geq\frac{n}{n-1}$. But nothing I've found seems particularly useful. I found that the problem simplifies to $\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-a_i}\leq\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{1-b_i}$, but without further progression.

1391226,Proving this result on tangent spaces to foliations,"Reading through Lee's introduction to smooth manifold, I bumped into this result: $\textbf{Lemma 14.12.}$ Let $\cal F$ be a foliation of a smooth manifold $M$ . The collection of tangent spaces to the leaves of $\cal F$ forms an involutive distribution on $M$ . I've tried to prove it, but have gotten stuck. A foliation is basically slicing $M$ into $k$ -dimensional submanifolds (immersed submanifolds), called leaves, so that each $p\in M$ has a neighborhood $(U,\phi)$ which intersects each leaf either in the empty set or in a coutable union of ""slices"", i.e. connected pieces where the final $\dim M-k$ coordinates of $\phi$ are constant. This type of chart is called flat chart . I have to prove the tangent spaces to the foliation give a $k$ -dimensional distribution on $M$ . A distribution is assigning to each point a linear subspace $\Delta_p$ of dimension the distribution's dimension, in this case $k$ , of the tangent space $T_pM$ , in such a way that each $p\in M$ has a neighborhood $U$ with $k$ linearly independent fields $X_1,\dotsc,X_k$ on $U$ which are smooth and span $\Delta_q$ for all $q\in U$ , i.e. $\Delta_q=\mathrm{span}(X_1(q),\dotsc,X_k(q))$ for all $q\in U$ . That we have a subspace of the tangent space per point of $M$ is easy: take the tangent spaces to the leaves. The $k$ fields are the first problem. How do I construct them? I'm sure I must use the flat charts somehow. Perhaps the coordinate fields of the flat chart? Those may not span the subspaces though. So how do I find these fields? Involutiveness means that those $k$ fields have Lie brackets which stay in the distribution. If I can't show the fields exist, I certainly cannot show they fulfill this condition, so I am stuck here. How do I proceed?","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'foliations']"

1391295,Few questions about the basics of Cardinality,"I am looking for some help to either conform that my reasoning is sound, or to please elaborate to me more on the subject so I can gain a better understanding. I am studying some from my class notes, and some from other sources. Suppose we are able to use the Cantor-Bernstien theorem i.e. that if $|A| \le |B|$ and $|B| \le |A|$ then $|A|=|B|$ or in other words if there is an injection from A to B and an injection from B to A, then there exists a bijection from A to B ( and hence a bijection from B to A as well), without requiring proof, and where $|A| \le |B|$ means there exists an injection from A to B. Using this and the prior knowledge that $$| \mathbb{N} |= | \mathbb{Z} |$$ I want to prove a few basics such as; $$|\mathbb{N}|=|\mathbb{N \times N}|$$ Now my question about this is, is the following valid and in line with the above thereoms? We could take $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N \times N}$ by $f(n)=(n,0)$ and $g: \mathbb{N \times N} \to \mathbb{N}$ by $g(n,m)=2^{n}3^{m}$ which are both injective, so by cantor bernstien there exists a bijection and thus they are of equal cardinality. Next, using some of that I want to prove $$| \mathbb{Z} | = | \mathbb{Z \times Z}|$$ Let $h: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N \times N}$ be a bijection ( which from the previous paragraph we know exists)
My professor then hinted to me that a bijection $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}$ induces a bijection $g=(f,f):  \mathbb{N \times N} \to \mathbb{Z \times Z}$. I am not sure I understand this part. Can anyone help to explain what that means, and how it is allowed? And from that I think we can form a function composition that allows us to use that composition of bijections is bijective to finish the proof. And lastly, I want to consider a proof of $$| \mathbb{N} | = | \mathbb{Q} |$$ Would it be correct to say if I can find some injective $f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z \times Z}$ and some injective $g: \mathbb{ Z \times Z} \to \mathbb{Q}$ and I could conclude a bijective $h:\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z \times Z}$  exists and hence from the previous paragraph I can directly conclude the proof? Is there a method I could use that incorporates the definition of rationals via equivalence classes of integers? What would be the best injective functions for the cases, $f(\frac{m}{n})=(m,n)$ $n \ne 0$
and $g(m,n)=\frac{m}{n}$ ? Anyways, my apologies for the long post, but I wanted to make sure I got all my questions/ideas out here so I can work to better understand. Thank you all for any help and insight.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification', 'cardinals']"

1391322,"This theory proof about instability of a point of equilibrium is not understandable for me, any help?","-This theory is irritating me, because I don't understand it's logic. Theorem: If in some neighboorhood $\mathbb O (0)$, exists a continuous, differentiable function $V(X), V(0)=0,$ such that the derivative based on the system: $X'=F(X)$ satisfies the inequality: $$\forall X \in \mathbb O(0): V'(X) \geq W(X)$$ where $W$ is some continuous, positive function on $\mathbb O (0),$ then the point of equilibrium $X=0$ is unstable. PROOF: In accordance with the conditions of the thereom, for every trajectory $X=X(t)$ of the system $X'=F(X)$ the function $V(X(t))$ is rising on the parts of the trajectory that are within $\mathbb K_r= \{X : \|X\|<r\}\subset \mathbb O(0).$Since $V$ is continuous on $\mathbb K_r,V(0)=0,\exists M, \mathcal E_0 > 0, \mathcal E \leq r:$ $$\forall X \in \mathbb K_{\mathcal E_0}:V(X)<M$$ Let $\delta \in (0, \mathcal E_0)$ be arbitrarily small.

$$\forall t >t_0: V(\varphi(t))> V(\varphi(t_0))=V(X_0)>0$$ or 
$$\exists \beta \in (0, \mathcal E_0) \forall t \geq t_0: \|\varphi(t)\| \geq \beta$$ therefore $$V'(\varphi(t))\geq W(\varphi(t))\geq  \min_{\beta \leq \|X\|\leq \mathcal E_0}W(X)= \gamma > 0.$$ (The following line kills me!) -Therefore function V is unlimited on $\mathbb K_{\varepsilon_0}$ a contradiction has arrised and we conclude that: $$\exists \varepsilon_0 > 0 \forall \delta >0, \exists X_0 \neq 0, \|X_0\| \leq \delta, \exists T > t_0, \|\phi(T)\|>\varepsilon_0$$ which is the definition of instability.

1391362,Proving cauchy sequence is convergent sequence.,"I know it's very petty question in real-analysis but I want to make the proof finely logical. There is 3 steps of the proof, we all know well, that cauchy sequence is convergent sequence. The first is proving cauchy sequence is bounded. The second is that by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a cluster point. The third is showing the original cauchy sequence is convergent to the cluster point. I think there is a logical gap in my text book, but i cannot make it fine. Let $L$ be the cluster point of $\{a_n\}$ which is cauchy sequence. Then there exists a subsequence $\{a_{n_k}\}$ convergent to $L$. Given  $\epsilon>0$, $\exists N_1 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall k : [k>N_1 \rightarrow |a_{n_k} - L| < \epsilon/2$. By cauchy condition, $\exists N_2 \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n,m : [n,m > N_2 \rightarrow |a_m - a_n| < \epsilon/2$. $\textbf{N := max\{N_1, N_2\}}$, then for all $n>N$
    $$|a_n-L| = |a_n - a_{n_{N+1}} + a_{n_{N+1}} -L| \leq |a_n - a_{n_{N+1}}| + |a_{n_{N+1}} -L| < \epsilon.$$ I think the bold text is the logical gap in the proof. If we set $N$ like the above proof, there is no verification that $n_{N+1} > N_2$. So, if we make this proof well, additory condition is required such as $\textbf{N :=max\{N_1, N_2\}}$, then for all $n>N$ $\textbf{and $n_k>N$} $.

1391385,What does this use of little-o notation mean?,"I am currently going through the proof of Prime Number Theorem, as given in Hardy and Wright, and in it they define the following constant: $$\alpha = \limsup_\limits{x \to \infty} \left|V(x) \right|$$ It then states:
$$|V(x)| \leq \alpha + o(1)$$ The book explains that $f(x)=o(g(x))$ means that $f(x)/g(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$, and likewise $f(x)=o(1)$ simply means that $f(x) \to 0$ as $x \to \infty$. It also states that the use of $o(g(x))$ in an equation simply means ""some unspecified function f(x) such that f(x)=o(g(x))"".

1391455,Construction of partitions of unity in Warner,"On p. 11 of Warner's Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups , he discusses partitions of unity. The theorem says Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold and $\{U_\alpha: \alpha \in A \}$ an open cover of $M$ . Then there exists a countable partition of unity $\{ \varphi_i : i = 1, 2, 3, \dotsc \}$ subordinate to the cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ with $\operatorname{supp}\varphi_i$ compact for each $i$ . If
one does not require compact supports, then there is a partition of
unity $\{\varphi_\alpha \}$ subordinate to the cover $\{U_\alpha \}$ (that is, $\operatorname{supp} \varphi_\alpha \subset U_\alpha$ ) with at most
countably many of the $\varphi_\alpha$ not identically zero. I am fine with the first part of the theorem: he constructs a countable partition of unity $\varphi_i$ with compact supports. Then, for the second part, he says If we let $\varphi_\alpha$ be identically zero if no $\varphi_i$ has
support in $U_\alpha$ , and otherwise let $\varphi_\alpha$ be the sum
of the $\varphi_i$ with support in $U_\alpha$ , then $\{\varphi_\alpha\}$ is a partition of unity subordinate to the cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ with at most countably many of the $\varphi_\alpha$ not
identically zero. To see that the support of $\varphi_\alpha$ lies in $U_\alpha$ , observe that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a locally finite family
of closed sets, then $\overline{\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A} =
 \bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}} A$ . Observe, however, that the support of $\varphi_\alpha$ is not necessarily compact. If $\sum_\alpha \varphi_\alpha$ is to be identically $1$ , then we have to make sure that we're not counting any $\varphi_i$ twice, right? But we will count it twice if $\operatorname{supp}\varphi_i$ lies in $U_\alpha$ for more than one $\alpha$ , right? So perhaps we have to renormalize afterward...that would be OK, but how do we know that $\operatorname{supp}\varphi_i$ doesn't lie in infinitely many $U_\alpha$ ? Does it have to do perhaps with the particular construction of the $\varphi_i$ he's chosen? (I don't see how.) For instance, a stupid example which seems to break this construction is the open cover of a manifold $M$ by infinitely many copies of the single set $M$ . Then take the function $\varphi$ which is identically 1 on $M$ ...this works for the first part. But in defining $\varphi_\alpha$ in the second part, we seem to be trying to sum up infinitely many copies of $\varphi$ .","['differential-geometry', 'smooth-manifolds', 'general-topology']"

If there is $b$ in $B$ such that there is no pre-image under $f$ then we say $f$ is ""not surjective"". So what would we call a ""function"" which has the property that $f(a)$ is not defined for some $a$ in $A$? It seems like there should be a word for this, other than just saying $f$ is not a function. Edit: I realize that a function which is not well defined is not actually a function. I'm talking about informal speak, for example in class how we say ""let's check if this function is well defined"" as though it were a function even if it weren't well defined.

""In a gluing diagram, arrows or other markings are used show where a surface should be connected up with itself. A square without markings is just a square. It has boundaries in all directions. Now if we connect the left side to the right side, then a flatlander living in this space could go out the right side and come back in on the left. In fact, the flatlander could travel for ever in that direction without coming to a boundary. The top and bottom are still boundaries, though, so the flatlander couldn't travel far in either of those directions. "" These are samples of some basic configurations (left-right, up-down hope to be correct: cylinder, square, Möbius strip, torus, Klein bottle , and the real projective plane ) and my question is below them: The question I would like to ask is: Is it possible to glue the surface with itself in the same point, like if it was an angle of reflection of a mirror? so if the flatlander goes through one of those points which are glued to themselves, the flatlander will appear gradually exactly in the same place but in the bouncing direction of the angle of reflection? If that is possible, how is the gluing diagram drawn? Update (2015/08/25) : I have prepared an image of the question with a cylinder as example, ""east"" and ""west"" are glued, so the flatlander can walk along the surface and make a complete round, but the ""north"" and ""south"" are glued to themselves and the flatlander exiting will return exactly to the same point but ""bouncing"" in the point where is going out of the plane (like an angle of reflection in a mirror): I have been reading some previous questions here at MSE, but I did not find hints about this point. I apologize because probably it is very basic. References or links to information about gluing diagrams covering this question are very appreciated, thank you!

Now I use $\mathbb{R} $ to cover $S^1$ and the covering map is $t \rightarrow (\cos (2 \pi t), \sin (2 \pi t))$. Now I lift the path $\gamma '(t)$ to $\widetilde{\gamma '(t)}$. Now we observe that a circle  $\alpha(t)$ which passes through the point $\gamma (0)$ has the property that the lift  $\widetilde{\alpha '(t)}$ has its endpoint at $1$. As suggested by  Andrey Ryabichev we observe that one of the two pieces obtained because of simple closed regular curve is diffeomorphic to the disc.Now we know that $\gamma(t)$ and $\alpha (t)$ are homotopic by a differentiable homotopy $H(s,t)$.

No matter how close the two horns come to each other by the process, they can't touch together since it wouldn't be embedding of a sphere anymore.

Now of course it's a bit silly to specify the operator in this fashion. However, this does make me wonder what's so special about the formulation of the Kuratowski closure axioms that they deserve a name and fame?

I try to this way, $\tan x\ge x$, when $x\in(0,\frac\pi4)$, but this turns out to be $\tan x\ge0$, which is obvious even without calculation.
I think it can be solved by using the squeeze rule but I can't find a proper scaler to meet $A=g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)=A$ when $n\to\infty$ $\color{red}{Edit}$:
According to@Khallil's advice,
I can solve that $f(n)+f(n+2)=\frac1{n+1}$, and it's trivial that $\frac1{n+1}=f(n)+f(n+2)\le 2f(n)\le f(n-2)+f(n)=\frac1{n-1}$.
So $f(x)=\frac12$. This is easy and quick. Btw, is there any other idea? $\color{red}{Edit[2]}$:
I find that @Byron Schmuland 's method is especially useful in a specific kind of problem. $$f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^1\frac{x^n}{1+x}dx$$,for example, Let $X_,...,X_n$ be i.i.d. random variables with density$f(x)=1$ on $(0,1)$, CDF(cumulative density function) of $X$ is $F(x)=x$. Now let $M=\max(X_1,\dots,X_n)$, its density function is:
$f_M(x)=nx^{n-1}$ for $x\in(0,1)$
Also, it's also not hard to see that $M\to1$ in distribution as $n\to\infty$.
So,$$f(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_0^1\frac{x^n}{1+x}dx=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac1n\int_0^1{f_M(x)\frac{x}{x+1}dx}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac1nE(\frac{M}{M+1})=0$$

Notation. —Let $x$ be a nonzero element of $\Bbb Z_p$ ; write $x$ in the form $p^nu$ with $u\in\Bbb U$ . The integer $n$ is called the p-adic valuation of $x$ and denoted by $v_p(x)$ .

Proposition $\mathbf{3}.$ — The topology on $\Bbb Z_p$ can be defined by the distance $$d(x,y)=e^{-v_p(x-y)}\;.$$ The ring $\Bbb Z_p$ is a complete metric space in which $\Bbb Z$ is dense . The ideals $p^n\Bbb Z_p$ form a basis of neighborhoods of $0$ ; since $x\in p^n\Bbb Z_p$ is equivalent to $v_p(x)\ge n$ , the topology on $\Bbb Z_p$ is defined by the distance $d(x,y)=e^{-v_p(x-y)}$ . Since $\Bbb Z_p$ is compact, it is complete. Finally, if $x=(x_n)$ is an element of $\Bbb Z_p$ , and if $y_n\in\Bbb Z$ is such that $y_n\equiv x_n\pmod{p^n}$ , then $\lim.y_n=x$ , which proves that $\Bbb Z$ is dense in $\Bbb Z_p$ .

If we put on $[0,1]$ and $[0,1]^2$ the standard Euclidean metrics induced by $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ respectively, it is somewhat well known that $f$ can't be Lipschitz, because Lipschitz maps don't increase Hausdorff dimension , and we have $\dim_H([0,1])=1$ and $\dim_H([0,1]^2)=2$ , where $\dim_H$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension. To hope for such a map to be Lipschitz we can put on $[0,1]$ the metric given by $|\cdot|^{\frac12}$ , where $|\cdot|$ denotes the standard metric. In this case, since Hausdorff dimension relies on the metric, we have $\widetilde{\dim}_H([0,1])=\dim_H([0,1]^2)=2$ , where $\widetilde{\dim}_H$ denotes the Hausdorff dimension with respect to the metric $|\cdot|^{\frac12}$ on $[0,1]$ . Hence, it is a priori possible to find a Lipschitz space-filling curve $f$ . The fact that $\widetilde{\dim}_H([0,1])=2$ is an easy calculation using the fact that $\dim_H([0,1])=1$ . I should be able to prove, using some nice properties of dyadic numbers that the Hilbert curve is indeed Lipschitz in this case (with $L=1$ ). I couldn't extend such proof to other curves which do not have any nice dyadic structure, for instance the Peano curve .  I could attempt to write down the proof, but for the time being this is not helpful to the purpose of my question so I will postpone until someone requires it.

Is it true that any space-filling curve is Lipschitz? If yes, why? If not, is there a counterexample?

$$LHS=X_{t} Y_{t}=\left(X_{0} +\int_{0}^{t} \mu_s ds+\int_{0}^{t} \sigma_s dW_s\right)\left(Y_{0} + \int_{0}^{t} b_s ds+\int_{0}^{t} h_s dW_s\right)=X_0 Y_0+X_0\int_0^t b_s ds+X_0\int_0^t h_s dW_s+Y_0\int_0^t \mu_s ds+\int_0^t\mu_s b_s (ds)^2+\int_0^t \mu_s h_s ds dW_s+Y_0\int_0^t \sigma_s dW_s+\int_0^t\sigma_s b_s dW_s ds+\int_0^t \sigma_s h_s (dW_s)^2=X_0 Y_0+X_0\int_0^t b_s ds+X_0\int_0^t h_s dW_s+Y_0\int_0^t \mu_s ds+Y_0\int_0^t \sigma_s dW_s+\int_0^t \sigma_s h_s ds,$$
since $dW_s ds=(ds)^2=0$ and $(dW_s)^2=ds$. Now the right-hand side (RHS) gives: $$RHS=X_0Y_0+\int_0^tX_sdYs+\int_0^tY_sdX_s+\int_0^t\sigma_s h_s ds= X_0Y_0+\int_0^t\left(X_{0} + \int_{0}^{s} \mu_r dr+\int_{0}^{s} \sigma_r dW_r\right)\left(b_s ds+h_s dW_s\right)+\int_0^t\left(Y_{0} + \int_{0}^{s} b_r dr+\int_{0}^{s} h_r dW_r\right)\left(\mu_s ds+\sigma_s dW_s\right)+\int_0^t\sigma_s h_s ds=$$
And using $d_s d_r=d_rdW_s=d_sdW_r=dW_r dW_s=0$, we get $LHS=RHS$.","['probability-theory', 'brownian-motion', 'martingales', 'stochastic-processes']"

$$A = 2\frac{a+d}{a-d} = 486662 \mod p$$
$$B = \frac{4}{a-d} = -486664 \neq 1 \mod p$$ My target $B$ is 1, so I determine a scaling factor: $$s = \sqrt{B^{-1}} \mod p =$$

How can I choose the correct one? In my case the generator $G$ of Curve25519 would be $(u, v_2)$.
