455255,Probabilities of uncountable intersection of events,"In order to determine a probability for some event $A\in\Omega$, I ended up with $$
\mathbb{P}\left(X_t>f(t),\quad \forall [0,T]\right)≤ \mathbb{P}(A)≤\mathbb{P}\left(X_t≥f(t),\quad \forall [0,T]\right),
$$ where $X_t$ is a continuous stochastic process$^*$ and $f(t)$ is a deterministic continuous function, both real-valued. The Question is whether $$\mathbb{P}\left(X_t>f(t),\ \forall [0,T]\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(X_t≥f(t),\ \forall [0,T]\right)\tag{1}$$ true or not? For finite intersections it's definitely true, i.e. $\mathbb{P}\left(X_{t_1}>f(t_1),X_{t_2}>f(t_2)\right)=\mathbb{P}\left(X_{t_1}≥f(t_1),X_{t_2}≥f(t_2)\right)$. The same is (perhaps) valid for countable intersections. Is it possible to show, that this is also true for uncountable case (1)? Thank you for your contribution. $^*\textbf{Edit:}$ Let's assume that $X_t$ is Brownian motion or geometric Brownian motion. In general it is obvious not true.

455256,parametrizing a circle near the origin,"In the book ""Using Algebraic Geometry"" by Cox and co-workers, i encountered the following example: consider the circle with center $(-1,0)$ and radius $1$, given by the equation $x^2+2x+y^2 = 0$. Then the authors say ""a parametrization of the circle near the origin is given by $x = \frac{-2t^2}{1+t^2}, y=\frac{2t}{1+t^2}$"". I can readily see that if we substitute for $x,y$ then the equation is still satisfied, and so every point given by this parametrization is a point of the circle. However, what does it mean to be ""a parametrization of the circle near the origin""? How does that connect to the fact that both of the rational functions that give the parametrization are elements of the local ring $k[t]_{(t)}$? I am looking for some argument that connects the algebra with the geometry.",['algebraic-geometry']

455296,Can a function with just one point in its domain be continuous?,"For example if my function is $f:\{1\}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(1)=1$. I have the next context: 1) According to the definition given in Spivak's book and also in wikipedia, since $\lim_{x\to1}f$ doesn't exist because $1$ is not an accumulation point, then the function is not continuous at $1$ (Otherwise it should be $\lim_{x\to 1}f=f(1)$). 2) According to this answer , as far as I can understand a function is continuous at an isolated point. I don't understand. Edit: Spivak's definition of limit: The function $f$ approaches to $l$ near $a$ means $\forall \epsilon > 0 \; \exists \delta > 0 \; \forall x \; [0<|x-a|<\delta\implies |f(x)-l|<\epsilon]$ Spivak's definition of continuity: The function $f$ is continuous at $a$ if $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=f(a)$","['general-topology', 'self-learning', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

455315,Does $\sum _{k=2} ^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}+(-1)^k}$ converge conditionally?,"Discuss the convergence of the sum: $$\sum _{k=2} ^\infty \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}+(-1)^k}.$$ My answer so far: It does not converge absolutely since $$\left | \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}+(-1)^k} \right | \geq \frac {1} {\sqrt{k} + 1},$$ the sum of whose terms diverges. Intuitively, I think it should converge conditionally because $ \sum \frac{(-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}}$ does, and the $(-1)^k$ in the denominator should not make a big difference. However, I am having trouble demonstrating its conditional convergence. Evidently, the problem is that $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}+(-1)^k}$ is not monotone. Let's call this sequence $a_n$. If we can show that $$\sum_{k=2}^\infty |a_k - a_{k-1}| < \infty,$$ then we're done by Dirichlet's test. But this seems to be $O(1/k)$. Any ideas?","['sequences-and-series', 'calculus', 'limits']"
455334,A question about odd perfect numbers,"Edit [in response to a comment from anon ]: Hereinafter, $N$ is a positive integer, $\sigma(N)$ is the sum-of-divisors of $N$, $\omega(N)$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $N$, and $\Omega(N)$ is the number of prime factors of $N$ (counting multiplicities). Thus, $N$ is a perfect number if $\sigma(N) = 2N$. A 2013 preprint by Nielsen claims to have proved that $\omega(N) \geq 10$ if $N$ is an odd perfect number. A paper by Ochem and Rao containing inequalities relating $\Omega(N)$ and $\omega(N)$ for $N$ an odd perfect number has been recently accepted in the Mathematics of Computation .  The state-of-the-art result for $\Omega(N)$ remains to be Hare's $\Omega(N) \geq 75$ . [Edit - August 29]  The state-of-the-art result for $\Omega(N)$ (where $N$ is an odd perfect number) is now Ochem and Rao's $\Omega(N) \geq 101$ . [End edit] [End edit - July 30 2013] If there exists an $i \in \left[1,\omega(N)\right]$ such that $$N \leq \frac{3}{2}{p_i}^{\alpha_i}\sigma({p_i}^{\alpha_i}),$$ then $$N = \prod_{i=1}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}}$$
(where the $p_i$'s are primes ordered in increasing magnitude and the $\alpha_i$'s are all positive) is ${\it not}$ an odd perfect number.  (See Theorem 4.2.5, page 112 in this M.Sc. thesis .) In particular, suppose $i = 1$.  (That is, let $p_1$ be the smallest prime factor of $N$.)  Then we have $${{p_1}^{\alpha_1}}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} = N = \prod_{i=1}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \frac{3}{2}{p_i}^{\alpha_i}\sigma({p_i}^{\alpha_i}) < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{2\alpha_1}},$$ from which it follows that $$\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_2}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{\alpha_1}}.$$ But we also have $${p_2}^{\Omega(N) - {\alpha_1}} = \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_2}^{\alpha_i}} \leq \prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N)}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_1}^{\alpha_1}} < \frac{9}{4}{{p_2}^{\alpha_1}} < {{p_2}^{\alpha_1 + 1}},$$ from which we obtain $$\frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2} < \alpha_1.$$ Note that we have obtained the result: ""If $$N = {p_1}^{2\alpha_1}{q^k}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N) - 1}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}}$$
is an odd (positive integer) with $\frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2} < \alpha_1,$ then $N$ is ${\it not}$ perfect."" Taking the contrapositive of the result we have obtained, we have: ""If 
$$N = {p_1}^{2\alpha_1}{q^k}\prod_{i=2}^{\omega(N) - 1}{{p_i}^{\alpha_i}}$$
is an odd perfect number with smallest prime factor $p_1$ and Euler prime $q$, then $\alpha_1 \leq \frac{\Omega(N) - 1}{2}$.""

455348,Gibbs / MCMC sampling for sum of parameters - how to improve slow mixing?,"Suppose I have a hierarchical Bayesian model, where my observational prediction, $y'$, is calculated as the sum of other parameters, ${\alpha_i}$. My observation equation (the likelihood) is: $P(y | \{\alpha_i\}, \sigma) \sim N(\sum_i \alpha_i, \sigma^2)$. I want to perform inference on the $\{\alpha_i\}$ parameters. Using the usual notation, let $\{\alpha_{-j}\}$ be the subset of $\{\alpha_i\}$ not including $\alpha_j$. Considering $\alpha_j$, $P(\alpha_j | \{\alpha_{-j}\}, y, \sigma) \sim N(y - \sum_{i \neq j}\alpha_i, \sigma^2)\,P(\alpha_j)$, where $P(\alpha_j)$ is the prior. Now you can obviously implement a Gibbs sampler for this, sampling each $\alpha_i$ in turn, but the mixing will be slow if there area a lot of $\alpha$ parameters as each parameter depends on the other one. I am looking to see if there is a way of drawing from the joint distribution for this (which would eliminate this problem), but I can't see how to work out the joint distribution $P(\{\alpha_i\} | y, \sigma)$. Note 1: This is not a homework problem. Note 2: my actual problem is more complicated, because the observation equation actually depends on a weighted sum of the $\{\alpha_i\}$, and then I have to deal with priors etc. I think the problem will ultimately be tractable if I can understand how to do this bit. Many thanks! OK after I have written this I've realised that the full joint probability is $P(\{\alpha_i\} | y, \sigma) \sim P(y | \{\alpha_i\}, \sigma)\,P(\{\alpha_i\})$ - the answer is right in front of me. I guess my question relates to how to sample this well - can this expressed in a form where it is multivariate normal for instance? I don't think so due to the interdependence of parameters.  Does this mean that Metropolis or Metropolis-Hastings is the only way to go?","['statistics', 'markov-chains', 'monte-carlo', 'sampling']"

455498,How to prove a claim stating that there are lots of real numbers which are not rational.,"Dear reader of this post, I am trying to prove a claim stating that there are lots of real numbers which are not rational. Unfortunately, I do not know whether I should use a constructive proof or show the contrapositive because I do not know how to deal with some elements of the conditional statement when pursuing either strategy. The claim is as follows: If $a $ is a positive integer such that $a \neq b^2$ for any $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ then there is no rational number $r$ such that $r^2 = a$. I tried a constructive prove at first. However, I am stumbling when using the statement $a \neq b^2$. Afterwards, I tried to prove the contrapositive but I cannot negate the hypothesis. I rewrote the conditional statement in term of quantifiers as:

\text{If} \ ( \exists a \in \mathbb{Z}_{++}: a \neq b^{2} \ \forall b \in \mathbb{Z}), \text{then} \ ( \not \exists r \in \mathbb{Q}: r^{2} = a).

455537,Extending the primes,"I had an idea and I'd like to find out whether it has a name or has been studied before. Imagine the natural numbers and the operations of addition and multiplication, but with the following restriction: multiplication can only be carried out $d$ times, and only with prime numbers. Any number that usually has more than $d$ prime factors now becomes 'prime' in the new system. So, if $d=2$ say, then $8$ becomes a new 'prime' because the usual prime decomposition of $8= 2\times2\times2$ takes 'too many' multiplications; similarly, if $d=3$ then $16=2\times2\times2\times2$ becomes 'prime'. Has this kind of thing ever been studied? Edit: I've been asked to clarify this, so here's two other ways of describing the same object. Geometrically. In a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, let $\mathscr{D}$ be the smallest set of natural numbers such that you can represent every natural number as the volume of a $d$-dimensional box with edge lengths that are members of $\mathscr{D}$. $\mathscr{D}$ always contains the primes, and if $d<\infty$ it also contains other numbers. Perhaps it'd be interesting to understand those other numbers. Algorithmically. First, put all the prime numbers in a set $\mathscr{D}$. Then, put every number $n$ with $\Omega(n)>d$ in $\mathscr{D}$ (where $\Omega(n)$ is the number of indistinct prime divisors of $n$). Finally, go through each of the numbers $n$ for which $\Omega(n)>d$ (i.e. the ones which were just added to $\mathscr{D}$) in increasing order, and for each such number $n$ that has not yet been removed from $\mathscr{D}$, remove from $\mathscr{D}$ every number $m$ that is product of $n$ and $d-1$ (possibly identical) numbers $k_1,k_2,...,k_{d-1}$ such that each $k_i\in\mathscr{D}$ and each $k_i \le n$.

455558,Probability sequential terms of a linear congruential generator are coprime,"I was following section 3.1.2 of the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming where they calculate $\pi$ using Cesàro's theorem that the probability two randomly chosen numbers are coprime is $6 \over \pi^2$.

  $$R = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2-3, 2X+4).$$ This is what I've got by myself and by using an internet source: Writing the ring $R = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2−3, 2X+4)$ as $\mathbb{Z}[X]/I$, we note that $I $ contains $2(X^2−3)−(X−2)(2X+4) = 2$. We then note that the generator $2X + 4$ is actually superfluous since $2X + 4 = 2(X + 2)$. Now we can write $R = \mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2 − 3, 2) = \mathbb{Z}[x]/((X+1)^2, 2)$, because $(X+1)^2=X^2+2X+1=X^2-3+2X+4$. The internet source states now the following: $$ R \cong (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})[\alpha] \quad \text{with} \quad \alpha = X+1$$
I guess that $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]$ represents the set of dual numbers of the field $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. I see that $\alpha^2=0$, but what exactly implies the isomorphism?

455626,What does limit actually mean?,"I have been in a deep confusion for about a month over the topic of limits! According to our book, the limit at $a$ is the value being approached by a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$. I have a doubt that in real number line we can never ever reach the closest value to $a$ because always a more closer value will exist. Now when talking about our methods for calculating limit, what method comes in our mind when we have to calculate where the value approaches? Let's say we have to find what value $f(x)$ approaches when $x$ moves from $[0,a)$. So we calculate the value of $f(x)$ at $x=0$, say $4$, and then at $x\to a$. But the problem is that we don't know the value $x\to a$, so we say the value is $a-h$ where $h\to 0$ and calculate the value of $f(a-h)$, say $5-h$. Now here is where my doubt starts! In the final step we put the value of $h=0$ say in that it is an infinitesimal quantity. My doubt is that $h$ was tending to $0$ means that it was never equal to zero  maybe it is infinitesimally small, not a stationary value, not an imaginable value, but we know for sure that it is not  equal to $0$. Maybe it is the point closest to zero, but it is not equal to zero and when we use the result $5-h=5$ we are actually making an error which is tending to zero. Maybe the error is very small, but still, there is some error in that we cannot calculate it but we can see that there is this infinitesimal error present. That means we don't get the exact limiting value or last value of $f(x)$. $x$ belongs to $[0,a)$ but a value approximate to infinitesimal? Isn't it right! We get an approximated value?","['nonstandard-analysis', 'calculus', 'infinitesimals', 'limits']"

Moving value towards $0$ so in most places we use its magnitude equal to zero but at the same time we also know that infinitesimal is not equal so in all those places were we use value of infinitesimal equal to $0$ we are making an infinitesimal error and are not $100\%$ accurate, maybe $99.9999\dots\%$ accurate, but no $100\%$!

For any $p \in \mathbb{S}^{n}$, we have $$T_{p}\mathbb{S}^{n} = p^{\perp} = \lbrace v \in \mathbb{R}^{n+1}, \, p \cdot v = 0 \rbrace$$ The object of this exercise is to compute the exponential map $\exp \, : \, T\mathbb{S}^{n} \, \rightarrow \, \mathbb{S}^{n}$. Explain why, if $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold, $x \in M$ and $f \, : \, M \, \rightarrow \, M$ an isometry such that $\mathrm{D}_{x}f \cdot v = v$ for some $v \in T_{x}M$ then, for the geodesic $\gamma \, : \, [a,b] \, \rightarrow \, M$ with $\gamma(0) =x$ and $\gamma'(0)=v$, we have $f \circ \gamma = \gamma$. Show that if $(p,v) \in T\mathbb{S}^{n}$ with $v \neq 0$, the reflection $R \, : \, \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \, \rightarrow \, \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that fixes pointwise the plane spanned by $p$ and $v$ and reverses all vectors perpendicular to $p$ and $v$ is an isometry of $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. Explain why this shows that the geodesic $\gamma \, : \, [a,b] \, \rightarrow \, \mathbb{S}^{n} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that satisfies $\gamma(0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=v$ must be of the form $ \gamma(t) = c(t) p + s(t) \frac{v}{\Vert v \Vert}$. Explain why we mush have $c(t) = \cos(t\Vert v \Vert)$ and $s(t) = \sin(t\Vert v \Vert)$. Here is what I did : Let $t \in [a,b]$. By definition, $ (f \circ \gamma)'(t) = \mathrm{D}_{t}(f \circ \gamma) \cdot \frac{d}{dt}$ and by the chain rule, $(f \circ \gamma)'(t) = \mathrm{D}_{\gamma(t)} f \circ \mathrm{D}_{t} \gamma \cdot \frac{d}{dt} = \mathrm{D}_{\gamma(t)} f \cdot \gamma'(t)$. It follows that $(f \circ \gamma)'(0) = \mathrm{D}_{x} f \cdot v = v$. Furthermore, if $L(\gamma)$ denotes the length of the curve $\gamma$, let $\tilde{\gamma}(t) = (f \circ \gamma)(t)$ and we have :
$$ L(\tilde{\gamma}) = \int_{a}^{b} \Vert \dot{\tilde{\gamma}}(t) \Vert_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)} \: dt$$
where 
$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Vert \dot{\tilde{\gamma}}(t) \Vert_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}^{2} & = & g_{\tilde{\gamma}(t)}\left( \dot{\tilde{\gamma}}(t) , \dot{\tilde{\gamma}}(t) \right) \\
& = & g_{(f \circ \gamma)(t)} \left( \mathrm{D}_{\gamma(t)} f \cdot \gamma'(t) , \mathrm{D}_{\gamma(t)} f \cdot \gamma'(t) \right) \\
& = & g_{\gamma(t)} \left( \gamma'(t) , \gamma'(t) \right) \\
& = & \Vert \dot{\gamma}(t) \Vert_{\gamma(t)} 
\end{eqnarray*}
$$
because $f$ is an isometry. We get $L(\tilde{\gamma}) = L(\gamma)$. I think it suffices to prove that $\tilde{\gamma} = \gamma$ but I don't know which theorem it follows from. (I'm not so sure for this one) Let $W = \mathrm{Vect}(p,v) = \mathrm{Vect}(p,\frac{v}{\Vert v \Vert})$. Since $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} = W \oplus W^{\perp}$, I can define the reflection $R$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ as follows : $R = \mathrm{Id}$ on $W$ and $R = -\mathrm{Id}$ on $W^{\perp}$. Let $x \in \mathbb{S}^{n}$. There exists $\alpha \in W$ and $\beta \in W^{\perp}$ such that $x = \alpha + \beta$. Then, $R(x) = \alpha - \beta$. If $\Vert \cdot \Vert$ denotes the usual euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, it follows from Pythagore's theorem that $\Vert R(x) \Vert = \Vert x \Vert$. So, $R$ is an isometry of $\mathbb{S}^{n}$. I think we need to use the result from 2. but I don't know how to use that $R \circ \gamma = \gamma$. I can use $\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert = \Vert v \Vert$ and $\Vert \gamma(t) \Vert = 1$ for all $t \in [a,b]$. Since $p \cdot v = 0$, we have 
$$ \Vert \gamma(t) \Vert^{2} = \vert c(t) \vert^{2} + \vert s(t) \vert^{2} = 1$$. So, we can say there exists some $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in [a,b]$, $c(t) = \cos(\ell t)$ and $s(t) = \sin(\ell t)$. From the condition $\Vert \gamma'(t) \Vert = \Vert v \Vert$, it follows that $\ell = \Vert v \Vert$. Thank you for your help !","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

Edit: For $d \geq 4$, the point at infinity of the projective plane curve given by the projective closure of $y^2 = f(x)$ is singular by the Jacobian criterion, and this is the only singular point of the curve.

455853,Probability - mega millions question,"So here's the whole question (minus parts a,b because I'm only confused on c and d)...
2. A player in the Mega Millions lottery picks five different
integers between 1 and 56, inclusive, and a sixth integer
between 1 and 46, which may duplicate one of the earlier
five integers. The player wins the jackpot if the first five
numbers picked match the first five numbers drawn and
the sixth number matches the sixth number drawn. c) What is the probability that a player wins $150 by
matching exactly three of the first five numbers and
the sixth number or by matching four of the first five
numbers but not the sixth number? d) What is the probability that a player wins a prize, if a
prize is given when the player matches at least three
of the first five numbers or the last number. $\def\c(#1,#2){\binom{#1}{#2}}$
So, for part C, I know we need to use the formula $$P(A\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).$$ Though, how do events A and B happen at the same time? It seems like they cannot bot happen at the same time, so I think the answer is:
$$\c(5,3)\c(51,2) + \c(5,4)\c(51,1)\c(45,1)\over  \c(56,6)\c(46,1)$$ For part D, I know we should take the complement, but again I'm having difficulty figuring out the $P(A\cap B)$. Would it be:
1-(ways to get 0, 1, or 2 numbers right, + ways to get last number right - ways to get both first 0,1,2 numbers right and last number right) So, $$
1-\left(\c(51,5)\c(45,1) + \c(5,1)\c(51,4)\c(45,1) + \c(5,2)\c(51,3)\c(45,1)\right) + \c(51,5) - \left(\c(51,5) + \c(5,1)\c(51,4) + \c(5,2)\c(51,3)\right) \over \c(56,6)\c(46,1)

455914,A simple elementary school math/physics problem - but where's the mistake?,"I've come across this problem and managed to get the right answer, but there remains a mystery that I wasn't quite able to solve: the minus sign (or a lack thereof)! Here's the problem and my solution: A man walks across a bridge and when he's $40 \%$ of the way through, he spots a train incoming towards him at $40$ mph. He (through superhuman calculational ability or just massive pessimism) knows that if he would start sprinting towards the train, he would be run over at exactly the end of the bridge. He also knows that if he were to turn around and start sprinting away, he would be run over exactly at the beginning of the bridge. The question is to calculate how fast he can sprint. So I pick a 'coordinate system' such that the origin is the beginning of the bridge, the end of the bridge is at a distance $d$ from the origin. At time $t=0$, the man's position is $\frac{2}{5}d$ and the train is at $d+l$. Denote: $$s^{\pm}_{1}(t) \equiv \frac{2}{5}d \pm vt$$
$$s_2 (t) = d+l -40t$$ These are the positions of the man and the train respectively as functions of time. The plus/minus in the man's position is because he can either run towards or away from the train. With this notation, the conditions we are given are: $$s^+_1(t_0)=s_2(t_0)=d$$
$$s^-_1(t_1)=s_2(t_1)=0$$ From the first condition, we get a system of equation which after eliminating the time, gives $$v=24 \frac{d}{l}.$$ From the second condition, we get $$v=16 \frac{d}{d+l}.$$ This implies $$v=-8.$$ The correct answer is $v=8$mph, so the solution is more or less correct.

If the surface $S_1$ intersects the surface $S_2$ along the regular curve $C$, then the curvature $k$ of $C$ at $p\in C$ is given by $k^2\sin^2\theta=\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2-2\lambda_1\lambda_2\cos\theta$ Where $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are the normal curvatures at $p$, along th tangent line to $C$, of $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively, and $\theta$ is the angle made up by the normal vectors in $S_1$ and $S_2$ at $p$. My attempt at the proof: Since $\lambda_i=\langle T',\nu_i\rangle$, where $T$ is the tangent vector along $C$ and $\nu_i$ is the vector normal to $S_i$ at $p$. So, $\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2-2\lambda_1\lambda_2\cos\theta$ $=\langle T',\nu_1\rangle^2+\langle T',\nu_2\rangle^2-2\langle T',\nu_1\rangle\langle T',\nu_2\rangle\cos\theta$ $=|\langle T',\nu_1\rangle\nu_1-\langle T',\nu_2\rangle\nu_2|^2$ $=|\langle kN,\nu_1\rangle\nu_1-\langle kN,\nu_2\rangle\nu_2|^2$ $=k^2|\langle N,\nu_1\rangle\nu_1-\langle N,\nu_2\rangle\nu_2|^2$ So if I could show that $=|\langle N,\nu_1\rangle\nu_1-\langle N,\nu_2\rangle\nu_2|^2=\sin^2\theta$ I am done.

Proof : We assume the weaker version of the axiom of Union. So, If $S$ is a set, there exists a set $U$, such that $x \in A \wedge A \in S \rightarrow x \in U$. Let $\varphi(x)\,$ be ""$\, \exists A\in S.\, x\in A\,$"".

456215,Characteristic of an integral domain must be either $0$ or a prime number.,"Proposition: Characteristic of an integral domain must be either $0$ or prime number. I'm confused by this proposition. I think the characteristic of an integral domain should be always $0$.
Suppose it has characteristic $n$.
Then $n * a = 0$ for all a of the integral domain. since n is not $0$ and, if $c * d = 0$ in integral domain, it means $c=0$ or $d=0$,
a should be $0$. Hence $n * a$ is not $0$ when $a$ is nonzero. Therefore, characteristic should be always $0$. What's wrong with my thought?","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

456265,Applications of complex analysis?,"I am a math major and I really cannot understand complex analysis. I've tried it twice before doing so poorly on the midterms that I had to drop. I gave it a go during this summer and I again ended up dropping it. I know that all the courses in the curriculum serve some purpose. I've taken differential equations and real analysis, so I can get my degree without ever taking complex analysis, but a lot of people have told me it's an integral part of a maths education, though they never specified why. I want to know why. Why is complex analysis so important? What area outside of math (besides physics, electromagnetism; cannot stand physics) is complex analysis used?

456309,Why are topological spaces interesting to study?,"In introductory real analysis, I dealt only with $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then I saw that limits can be defined in more abstract spaces than $\mathbb{R}^n$, namely the metric spaces. This abstraction seemed ""natural""to me. Then, I knew the topological spaces. However, this time the abstraction did not seem natural/useful to me. Then one runs into problems of classifying spaces into normal/ first countable ... In my opinion, these resulted from the high  level of abstraction adopted by studying  topological spaces. When one uses a more general definition for a space, it is possible that the number of uninteresting objects increase. I guess this is what happened here, we use a very general definition for topological spaces, we get a lot of uninteresting spaces, then we go back and make classifications such as normal, Hausdorff,.. I was trying to justify to myself why are topological spaces are good to study. The best and only reason I can propose is that the category $Top$ is bicomplete. Question 1: (Alternatives to $Top$) If this is the only reason, can't there exist a ""smaller"" category   such that it contains all metric spaces and is bicomplete ? Question 2: (History of topological spaces) I mentioned that the abstraction from metric spaces to topological spaces does not seem very natural to me.  I suspect that historically, metric spaces were studied before topological spaces. If this is the case, I'd like to know what was the motivation/justification for this abstraction. Question 3: (Applications of non-metric topology outside topology) I mentioned earlier that  ""we get a lot of uninteresting spaces"". Perhaps I am wrong  (I hope I am wrong). I would value non-metric topological spaces more, if I see examples of theorems such that: 1) The theorems are in a branch of mathematics outside Topology 2) The theorems are proven with the aid of topology 3) The topological part about the proof of the theorem is about a non-metric space Edit: ${}$ non-artificial instances of non-metric spaces appearing in other branches of math are valuable as well.

456318,"Every locally compact, second countable Hausdorff space has a countable basis of open sets with compact closure","Let $X$ be a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff space. I want to prove that it has a countable basis of opens with compact closure, and that this basis can be extracted as a subset of any basis of its topology by restricting to opens with compact closure. I understand the following: As locally compact space, for every point $x$ of $X$ we can find a compact neighbourhood $V$, thus, for every point $x$ of $X$ we can find an open $V_x$ containing $x$ and whose closure is compact (by taking $V_x = V$ if $V$ is open, or the open set whose closure is $V$ if $V$ is closed, i.e: $V_x$ such that $V_x = V°$). As second countable space, there is a basis family $\{U_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$ of opens such that for every point $x$ of $X$, and every open $V_x$ containing $x$, there is a $\alpha\in A$ such that $x\in U_{\alpha}\subset V_x$. Now, take a point $x$ in $X$, we can find an open $V_x$ around $x$ whose closure is compact, and find an element $U_{\alpha}$ of the basis such that $x\in U_{\alpha}\subset V_x$, the closure of $U_{\alpha}$ is a closed subset of the compact closure of $V_x$, thus, it is also compact. Thus, for each point $x$ and for each open $V_x$ around that point whose closure is compact we can find an open $U$ with compact closure containing $x$ and contained in $V$. Opens of the family basis whose closures are compact form a new basis family for the opens of the topological space with compact closures. Now, how to show that it actually form a new basis family for all the opens of the topological space? I guess that the ""Hausdorff"" condition has something to do with.","['general-topology', 'second-countable']"

I understand basic probability but I'm not quite sure how I would calculate this. The basic premise stands as follows: choose two distinct card ranks (without a suit) e.g. king and a 7 (but you cannot choose both the same). Shuffle the cards and now fan them out. There should be a king and a 7 adjacent to each other in the pack, just based on probabilities. My question is what are the chances of success here? Or how do you calculate it?",['probability']
