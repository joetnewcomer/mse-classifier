4914417,How to come up with a “gerrymandering” index / “roughness” index of some closed $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of finite area,"The answer to this question is not objective, but I believe this to be an interesting mathematical problem, which has different approaches one may take to arrive at an answer, and I’m interested to see what others may come up with. Gerrymandering is the process of drawing boundaries of constituencies in such a manipulative way such that a certain political party or group is favoured disproportionately to their size. Often a district can very obviously be seen to be gerrymandered if it appears to be an “ugly”, “rough”, “unnatural” shape - for example, very uneven borders and panhandles that stick out of it. The 12 Most Gerrymandered Districts In America - Ranker gives the following example of Maryland’s 3rd district: In reality, things may be more complicated and a “nice” looking shaped district may actually be heavily gerrymandered if it happens to over/underrepresent a certain demographic. For our purposes we will ignore such complexity and focus solely on the shape of a district. Formally, let $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be a closed set of finite area. I’m wondering if we can come up with some index $$g: \{ \text{such subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$} \} \to [0,1]$$ such that a “nicely shaped” $E$ , such as a near-circle/square/etc. has $g(E) \approx 0$ , and a “roughly shaped” $E$ , such as the shape of Maryland’s district 3 above, has $g(E) \approx 1$ . Some properties $g$ should have are that it should be invariant under scaling/reflection/rotation/translation of the shape $E$ , as such transformations make the shape no better or worse. An example of an attempt An attempt at a solution to this problem is to let $g(E)$ be one minus the probability that, picking two points $x_1, x_2 \in E$ uniformly at random, that the line connecting $x_1$ and $x_2$ lies entirely within $E$ . One positive of this index is that all convex $E$ have $g(E) = 0$ , i.e. not at all gerrymandered - a value we may want since convex sets have smooth boundaries, and are path-connected. $g$ is also invariant under rotations/translations/etc. A disadvantage of this index is a district may be considered heavily gerrymandered if there is a large hole, or several large holes within it, perhaps representing large lakes/seas in a real world setting. Also, “smooth” districts that are very much non-convex, such as a banana-shaped district, may be considered heavily gerrymandered. What I’m looking for in an answer I’m wondering if: There are any standard indexes for this problem or similar problems that someone has previously come up with Anyone has a particularly interesting idea for such an index. NB. We may wish to extend this question to $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ rather than $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ in a natural way.","['recreational-mathematics', 'mathematical-modeling', 'problem-solving', 'geometry']"
4914418,Direction for solving 3rd order non-linear ode $f(f''' - f'') + f'^2 = 0$,"What the title says - I was playing around with an equation and I ended up with the following $$ f(f''' - f'') + f'^2 = 0$$ It's nice because all the coefficients are $1$ I think, but that might not be exactly true either because of how it's multiplied. I've played around with it a bit but it's weird enough that I can't really make much progress on this. I did find that a solution for this is $f = c$ where $c$ is a constant. Then I get $c(0) + 0 = 0$ which is true but also doesn't feel like it's a complete solution.

4914457,$10$-digit numbers divisible by $66667$.,"Let us consider the set $S$ of $10$ -digit numbers whose digits are only allowed to be taken from the set $\{3,4,5,6,7,8\}$ . Let $S'$ be the subset of $S$ such that its elements are divisible by $66667$ . Then what is the cardinality of $S'$ ? I think this problem is similar to This one , so I try to solve this problem as follows: Let $abcdefghij$ be an element of $S'$ . Then we have that $3\cdot 66667\cdot abcde-2\cdot(100000\cdot abcde+fghij)$ is also divisible by $66667$ . We can thus write $$
abcde=2\cdot fghij+k\cdot 66667,
$$ where $k$ is an integer. Note that both $5$ -digit numbers are greater than $30000$ and are
less than $100000$ , so we further see that it is only possible for the the cases when $k=0,-1,-2$ . Unfortunately, I got stuck here. I think the factor $2$ before $fghij$ is annoying, and I have no idea how to step forward then.

4914465,Associativity of infinite products,"It is well-known that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ is an absolutely convergent complex series and $\mathbb N$ is partitioned as $J_1,J_2,\dots$ , then the series $\sum_{j\in J_n}a_j$ for all $n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{j\in J_n}a_j$ are both absolutely convergent, and $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{j\in J_n}a_j$ . I am trying to make sense of the same identity for infinite products. The convention I'm using is the following The product $\prod_{n=1}^\infty z_n$ is called convergent if there exists an $n_0$ such that the partial products $\prod_{j=n_0}^nz_j$ converge to a non-zero number as $n\to\infty$ . Write $z_n=1+w_n$ , the product is said to converge absolutely if $\prod_n(1+|w_n|)$ converges. It is a theorem that an absolutely convergent product is convergent and that $\prod_n(1+|w_n|)$ converges if and only if $\sum_n|w_n|$ does. Suppose $\prod_{n=1}^\infty z_n$ converges absolutely and $\Bbb N=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty J_n$ is a partition, I want to show that $$\prod_{n=1}^\infty z_n=\prod_{n=1}^\infty\prod_{j\in J_n}z_j,$$ with the RHS converging absolutely. By the characterisation of absolute convergence, we know that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty|z_n-1|$ converges, so the series $\sum_{j\in J_n}|z_j-1|$ converge for all $n$ and hence all the products $\prod_{j\in J_n}z_j$ converge absolutely. What I'm having trouble with is showing $\prod_{n=1}^\infty\prod_{j\in J_n}z_j$ converges (absolutely or not) and showing it is equal to the original product. By the characterisation of absolute convergence, it would be enough to show that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty|(\prod_{j\in J_n}z_j)-1|$ converges, but this has no discernible relation to the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\sum_{j\in J_n}|z_j-1|$ , which we do know converges by the ""associativity"" for absolutely convergent series.","['complex-analysis', 'absolute-convergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'infinite-product', 'convergence-divergence']"
4914472,What is the geometric explanation for why the shape operator is symmetric?,"The shape operator at acts on the tangent space of a manifold at $p$ : $S_p: T_pM \rightarrow T_pM$ By: $$S_p(v) = D_v(n(p))$$ That is, it sends the normal vector at $p$ to it's directional derivative in the direction of the input vector. The proof that this map is symmetric follows easily from the fact that partial derivatives commute, but I was hoping that somebody here could tell me why the geometric reason why this map is symmetric w.r.t. an inner product on the tangent space: $$S_p(V) \cdot U = V \cdot S_p(U)$$ The eigenvalues of this map are the principle curvatures and the direction of the eigenvectors are the principle directions.","['submanifold', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
4914495,Crazy integral with nested radicals and inverse sines,"Recently a friend who is writing a book on integrals added this problem to his book: $$\int_{0}^{1}\arcsin{\sqrt{1-\sqrt{x}}}\ dx=\frac{3\pi}{16}$$ After a while, when trying to generalize, I was able to find the following integrals: $$\int_{0}^{1}\arcsin{\sqrt{1-\sqrt{1-\sqrt{x}}}}\ dx=\frac{61\pi}{256}$$ $$\int_{0}^{1}\arcsin{\sqrt{1-\sqrt{1-\sqrt{1-\sqrt{x}}}}}\ dx=\frac{12707\pi}{65536}$$ For this last integral, simply apply a u-substitution with the term inside the arcsin: $$\int_{0}^{1}16u(1-u^2)(1-(1-u^2)^2)(1-(1-(1-u^2)^2)^2)\arcsin{u}\ du$$ Applying integration by parts and some algebra: $$\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(1-(1-(1-u^2)^2)^2)^2}{\sqrt{1-u^2}}\ du$$ With $\sin{t} = u$ , the integral becomes: $$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}(1-(1-\cos^4{t})^2)^2\ dt$$ Which can be easily calculated with some formulas for the beta function. However, when trying to solve the problem for n radicals, I was not able to solve this last step in a more general way, furthermore, the integrals with more radicals quickly become too large to calculate manually. Is it possible to calculate integrals for n radicals with some more simplified expression?","['integration', 'nested-radicals', 'inverse-trigonometric-functions', 'definite-integrals']"
4914555,"If sets $X$ and $Y$ have at least two elements each, then $X \cup Y \preceq X \times Y$","This is a problem from Derek Goldrei's Classic Set Theory, a book that I am currently working through. This is in a chapter titled 'Cardinals (without the Axiom of Choice)' in case that context is necessary. If sets $X$ and $Y$ have at least two elements each, then $X \cup Y \preceq X \times Y$ I've been struggling to come up with an injection to prove this. I understand what it's saying is analogous to saying that $x + y \leq xy$ when $x$ and $y$ are both greater than or equal to $2$ , and I thought by writing that proof out I would get some insight into proving the original statement, but that did not happen. I have written out a few finite examples and of course the injections are immediately spotted, but I haven't been able to form a general function. Going straight from $X \cup Y$ to $X \times Y$ doesn't seem feasible because there will be multiple ordered pairs for any given element in $X \cup Y$ . So I believe there will be some intermediate set(s) that I need to map $X \cup Y$ to in order to eventually map to $X \times Y$ such that all of the intermediate mappings are injections. I'm not necessarily looking for a full solution, more so a nudge in the right direction. Thanks.","['elementary-set-theory', 'intuition']"

\oint_\gamma f(z) d z=0.
$$ Many textbooks use Goursat's theorem or Green's theorem to prove this. I understand both proofs and can write it myself. Example: in Stein and Shakarchi's Complex Analysis the proof that the integral over a triangle of a holomorphic function is zero is due to a limiting argument. While this proof is elegant and slick, it doesn't give me any intuition of why the integral is zero. Are there any intuitive interpretations of this theorem that might help my understanding?

4914688,Making clear the definition of 'affine variety' in Mumford's book.,"I am reading ""The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes"" by Mumford. In section 4 the author defines the term affine variety : An affine variety is a topological space $X$ plus a sheaf of $k$ -valued functions $\mathcal{O}_X$ on $X$ which is isomorphic to an irreducible algebraic subset of some $k^n$ plus the sheaf just defined. There are a few things that are not clear to me. When it says ""which is isomorphic to"", what is the ""which"" referring to? To the whole pair $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ or just $X$ ? In any case, what is exactly the notion of ""isomorphism"" in this definition (and between what elements are we considering such isomorphism)? Is ""the sheaf just defined"" refering to the sheaf of regular functions $\mathcal{O}_X$ ? In the book, no other sheaf is considered (apart from the examples given after the definition of sheaf). I feel like I need some insight overall. Is the advantage of this definition that we ""forget"" about the ambient space $k^n$ and we look at affine varieties as topological spaces + a sheaf? If yes, why does the sheaf provide that much information? Thanks a lot. Comments to give some context to the topic, even if they are not directly related to the question, are welcome.","['affine-varieties', 'definition', 'algebraic-geometry', 'intuition', 'sheaf-theory']"

4914807,Convergence of a Non-linear Recursive Sequence with Fractional Exponent,"I am exploring a recursively defined sequence involving non-integer exponents, and I aim to find or confirm the limit of $\left\{b_n\right\} \text { as } n \rightarrow \infty \text {. }
$ The sequence is defined as follows: Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t$ be initial fixed positive real numbers, and define the sequence $\{b_n\}$ by: For $n \leq t$ , $b_n = x_n$ . For $n > t$ , $$
  b_n = b_{n-1}^p + b_{n-2}^p + \cdots + b_{n-k}^p,
  $$ where $p$ is a real number with $0 < p < 1$ . Progress and Approach: Given the concavity of the function $f(x) = x^p$ for $x > 0$ and $0 < p < 1$ , we observe that $f(x) \leq x$ for $x \geq 1$ . This suggests that each term in the sequence contributes progressively less as it grows larger, potentially indicating boundedness or stabilization of $\{b_n\}$ . Assuming the sequence might converge to a limit $L$ , we can expect $L$ to satisfy the steady-state condition: $$
  L = k L^p.
  $$ Solving this leads to: $$
  L = k^{1/(1-p)}.
  $$ This suggests a fixed point, which we hypothesize might act as an attractor for the sequence. To further validate this, I considered the function $f : [0, \infty)^k \to [0, \infty)$ defined by: $$
  f(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = x_1^p + \ldots + x_k^p.
  $$ Given that the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}(x^p) = p x^{p-1}$ is less than 1 for all $x > 1$ and $p < 1$ , I aimed to examine if $f$ acts as a contraction mapping under a suitable metric. Defining the metric as: $$
  d((x_1, \ldots, x_j), (y_1, \ldots, y_j)) = \max |x_i - y_i|,
  $$ one needs to show that: $$
  |f(x_1, \ldots, x_j) - f(y_1, \ldots, y_j)| \leq C \max |x_i - y_i|,
  $$ where $C < 1$ . This would imply that $f$ gradually brings terms closer together, suggesting convergence towards the fixed point $L$ . Initially, setting $M = \max(x_1, \ldots, x_t)$ , it leads to: $$
  b_{t+1} \leq k M^p
  $$ and following the recurrence: $$
  b_{t+2} \leq k \cdot (k M^p)^p = k^{1+p} M^{p^2}
  $$ indicating each term might be bounded by a decreasing sequence as $M^{p^n}$ approaches zero for large $n$ , given $p^n$ ’s exponential decay. Considering these, how can I rigorously prove the hypothesized convergence towards $L = k^{1/(1-p)}$ , or assess how the sequence will converge/bound instead? I would greatly appreciate any insights, corrections, or suggestions on methods to rigorously confirm whether $\{b_n\}$ converges and to what limit.","['limits', 'convergence-divergence', 'upper-lower-bounds', 'sequences-and-series']"
4914865,What probability distribution function is this?,"This is sort of a followup to this question (I'll mention everything relevant in this post though so no need to click link). Main Question: I was trying to study a random variable $Y$ . I will describe it here: Suppose we flip a fair coin $L$ times. Then, we let the random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_s$ represent the counts of consecutive runs. For example, if $L = 5$ , and I flip $$HHTHH,$$ then $X_1 = 2$ (two heads), $X_2 = 1$ (followed by one tails), $X_3 = 2$ (followed by two heads). In this example, we let $s$ be the count of the number of consecutive runs (3 in this example). Now, I want to understand the behavior of $Y = \prod (X_i+1)$ as $L \to \infty$ . Specifically, I want to understand how the pdf/cdf of the limiting probability distribution looks like. Originally, I thought this would be a messy probability distribution with nothing interesting about it. However, when I graphed the pmf (histogram with about 200 bins for the log of the value of the RV) for $L = 17$ or $18$ , I got something cool (shown below). Can someone provide some insight into what $Y$ , or $Pr(Y < a)$ is? Thanks! 😁 Please explain this like I’m an undergrad who kinda paid attention in probability class for the first half of the semester. One suggestion for a possible answer (though I am slightly skeptical) : $$Pr(Y < a) \approx Pr\left(\log \prod_{i=1}^{\left\lfloor\frac{L}{2}\right\rfloor} 1 + Geo(1/2) < \log(a)\right)$$ One thing that was suggested was to model each $X_i$ as a geometric random variable $G_i$ . Then, if we let $Z_s = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{s}(G_i + 1)$ , then we take $\log(Z_s)$ , we can use the central limit theorem and send $s \to \infty$ . It was then suggested that since $s$ will be about $L/2$ , we can approximate the distribution (pdf/cdf) of $Y$ with $Z_{\lfloor L/2 \rfloor}$ . While this explains the lognormal shape, I would now like to know why it is this is the case. Specifically, why can we approximate the $X_i$ 's with i.i.d. geometric random variables as $L \to \infty$ (necessary for CLT) and why the ""distribution of $Y$ converges to the distribution of $Z_{\lfloor L/2 \rfloor}$ ."" Specifically, it was suggested that $\mathbb{P}(Y< a)=\mathbb{P}(\log Z_{L/2}< \log  a)
=\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{\log Z_{L/2}-L\mu/2}{\sigma\sqrt{L/2}}< \frac{\log a-L\mu/2}{\sigma\sqrt{L/2}}\right)\asymp \Phi\left(\frac{\log a-L\mu/2}{\sigma\sqrt{L/2}}\right)$ This does explain the lognormal shape as expected. If this is the wrong way to approach this problem, please explain why and what I should do instead. And if it is correct, can someone work out the details of this (law of large numbers + CLT analysis details) and as a followup, when is it in general where we can make these approximations? Graph of pmf (looks like lognormal?) Below, I graphed a rough histogram of the distribution of the value of the random variable when $L$ is around 17. Some of the details might be off but theres is some lognormal shape to it and I wish to understand where this shape comes from and whether the random variable $Y$ tends to something nice like that below.

4914875,When is an ergodic Ito diffusion also mixing,"If $(X_t,t\geq0)$ denotes the strong solution to the Ito SDE $\mathrm{d}X_t=b(X_t)\mathrm{d}t+\sigma(X_t)\mathrm{d}W_t$ for $W_t$ the standard $d$ -dimensional Brownian motion and $b,\sigma$ satisfying the usual conditions with $X_0=x$ and $\sigma$ additionally satisfies the uniform hypoelliptic assumption. Additionally, we assume that $X_t$ is ergodic in the sense that the semigroup $P_t$ converges to the invariant probability measure $\mu$ in total variation norm. I am curious what conditions we need to impose on the process in order to obtain that $X_t$ additionally satisfies mixing properties (for example one of the mixing concepts in Basic Properties of Strong Mixing Conditions. A Survey and Some Open Questions ). Intuition says that there must exist some argument to argue that indeed ergodicity induces sufficient ""regularity"" on the trajectories to ensure some form of mixing. For example, example 2.2.18 in the book Stochastic
Processes and Long Range Dependence argues that a centered stationary Gaussian process $(X_n,n\in\mathbb{Z})$ is ergodic if and only if it is weakly mixing. Indeed the class of Gaussian processes could be considered one of the ""nicest"" processes to work with, yet the Ito diffusion inherets many of the welcoming properties of the Brownian motion, and so I feel that a similar result should exist for the Ito diffusion (perhaps under additional (mild) assumptions).

If such a ring Hom exists it induces an injective group Hom between the multiplicative groups, so by (b) $|E|$ is a power of $|F|$ .

4914924,Finding a function which is $L^1$ not $L^2$ and the integral is bounded by the square root.,"So I have been trying to solve the following this past exam problem: Find $f\in L^1(\mathbb{R})$ , not $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with the property: $$
\int_{A}|f(x)|dm\leq \sqrt{m(A)}\quad\text{ for all } A\in\mathcal{L} \text{ with } m(A)<\infty
$$ I tried to start solving the problem for a $A$ a bounded interval on $\mathbb{R}$ and then use some approximation theorem. The best function I found so far is $$
f(x)=\frac{e^{-\sqrt{x}}}{2\sqrt{x}}
$$ Then we can see that $f\in L^1( \mathbb{R})$ , not $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ , because of $1/x$ problems, and for an interval $I=[a,b]$ with $0\leq a\leq b$ : $$
\int_{I}f\leq \int_I \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}=\sqrt{b}-\sqrt{a}\leq \sqrt{b-a}=\sqrt{m(I)}
$$ Now also we notice that $F=-e^{-\sqrt{x}}$ is an antiderivative for f. So if we have two disjoint intervals $I_1=[a,b]$ and $I_2=[c,d]$ then: \begin{equation}
\int_{I_1\cup I_2}f=e^{-\sqrt{a}}-e^{-\sqrt{b}}+e^{-\sqrt{c}}-e^{-\sqrt{d}}\quad (1)

e^{-\sqrt{a}}-e^{-\sqrt{b}}+e^{-\sqrt{c}}-e^{-\sqrt{d}}\leq \sqrt{b-a+d-c}=\sqrt{m(I_1\cup I_2)}
$$ I tested some values on desmos and it seems to hold but I can't get a direct proof, maybe the convexity of $e^{-\sqrt{x}}$ could give something. If this is solved then we could just approximate the measurable set by a finite number of disjoint intervals and get the result for f, then just do $g(x)=f(|x|)$ to get it for $\mathbb{R}$ . In general if this doesn't work I believe that the idea of trying $g(x)/2\sqrt{x}$ should give an example for ""very decaying"" g.","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'real-analysis']"

4915051,Inclusion-Exclusion confusion: Meeting exactly one friend in lunch time during a semester,"From Trotter's Combinatorics Textbook, I was working on this problem from his Inclusion-Exclusion Chapter: A graduate student eats lunch in the campus food court every Tuesday over the course of a $15$ week semester. [They are] joined each week by some subset of a group of six friends from across campus. Over the course of a semester, [they] ate lunch with each friend 11 times, each pair 9 times, and each triple 6 times. [They] ate lunch with each group of four friends 4 times and each group of five friends 4 times. All seven of them ate lunch together only once that semester. Did the graduate student ever eat lunch alone? If so, how many times? The solution mainly involves making your sets $A_{i}$ as the set of weeks he ate with friend $i$ , and doing inclusion-exclusion from there. (See Chapter 7 Solutions, Question 9: https://trotter.math.gatech.edu/math-3012/toppage.html ) Now I tried to answer my own follow-up question of how many days he eat with exactly 1 friend. Since I know that $|A_{1} \cup \dots \cup A_{6}| = 14$ , I could just try to do: $|A_{1} \cup \dots \cup A_{6}| - |(A_{1} \cap A_{2}) \cup \dots \cup (A_{5} \cap A_{6})|$ Now the formula for $|(A_{1} \cap A_{2}) \cup \dots \cup (A_{5} \cap A_{6})|$ I couldn't find online or in the textbooks, so I tried to just count it out myself and noticed a pattern that I think generalizes: If I add up all the sets that are intersections of 2 friends, I've overcounted the sets that are intersections of 3 friends ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ times, so I have to subtract those sets and their quantities 2 times for them to be counted exactly once! Then for the sets 4-friend-intersections, I first counted them ${4 \choose 2}$ times, then subtracted them $2 \cdot {4 \choose 3}$ times, hence they've been counted $ 6 - 8 = -2$ times, so I have to add those sets and their quantities 3 times. You continue this logic and you get the coefficients should be +1, -2, +3, -4, +5. In particular I mean that: $$ |(A_{1} \cap A_{2}) \cup \dots \cup (A_{5} \cap A_{6})| = \sum|(A_{i} \cap A_{j})| - 2 \cdot \sum |(A_{i} \cap A_{j} \cap A_{k})| + 3 \cdot \sum |(A_{i} \cap A_{j} \cap A_{k} \cap A_{l})| - 4 \cdot \sum |(A_{i} \cap A_{j} \cap A_{k} \cap A_{l} \cap A_{m})| + 5 \cdot \sum |(A_{i} \cap A_{j} \cap A_{k} \cap A_{l} \cap A_{m} \cap A_{n})|$$ But when I try plugging in the numbers I get -16: ${6 \choose 2}9 - 2 {6 \choose 3} 6 + 3  {6 \choose 4}  4 - 4  {6 \choose 5}  4 + 5  {6 \choose 6}  1 = -16$ which is weird since I use this same method for this problem ( Combinations' Problem ) and I get 7 and hence 13 - 7 = 6 times they ate with exactly 1 friend alone, which is correct.

4915309,43 cookies are randomly given to 10 children. What's the probability each child receives at least 2 cookies?,"I wanted to ask 1) if I've solved this puzzle problem correctly, and 2) if there is a shorter or more elegant approach. There are 43 cookies to be given out at random to 10 children. What is the probability that each child gets at least 2 cookies? First, notice that this is a classic multinomial setup. The multinomial distribution can be thought of as giving the probability
of observing the outcome $i \in \{ 1, ..., k \}$ coming up $x_i$ times when rolling a $k$ -sided die $n$ times, and is a generalization of the Binomial distribution. We have that the probability of each outcome $i$ coming up on a single roll is given by $\pi_i$ . If the so-called die is fair, $\pi_i = \pi_{i'}\; \forall i, i' \in \{ 1, ..., k\}$ or the die is unfair and $\pi_i$ is not necessarily equal to $\pi_i'$ . In all cases, we assume $\sum \pi_i = 1$ . Let $X = (X_1, ..., X_k)$ be a $\text{Multinomial}(n, k, \pi)$ distributed where $\pi = (\pi_1, ..., \pi_k)$ . The density of the Multinomial distribution is \begin{align}
P(X = x) & = {n \choose x_1,...,x_k!} \prod_{i=1}^k \pi_i^{x_i} \\\\
& = \frac{n!}{x_1!\cdots x_k!}\pi_1^{x_1} \cdots \pi_k^{x_k}.
\end{align} Here, let $X_1, ..., X_{10}$ denote how many of the $n=43$ cookies each of the $k=10$ children received. Let $p_n$ denote the probability that all 10 children receive at least 2 cookies each given that $n$ are given out uniformly at random. Notice that $$
{\small
X_1, ..., X_{10} \Bigg\vert \sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i = 43 \sim 
\text{Multinomial}(n = 43, k = 10, \pi_i = 1/10),}
$$ where $\pi_i = 1/10$ indicates that the distribution of cookies
is uniformly random (e.g., equal probability) across the 10 children. The Poisson and Multinomial distributions have an interesting relationship.
When the outcomes $X_1, ..., X_k$ are such that $X_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$ ,
then $\sum_{i=1}^k X_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i).$ One can easily derive via the definition of conditional probability that $$(X_1, ..., X_k) {\Bigg\vert} \sum_{i=1}^k X_i = N = n \sim \text{Multinomial}(n, k, \pi),$$ where $\pi = \left(\frac{\lambda_1}{\sum \lambda_i}, ..., \frac{\lambda_k}{\sum \lambda_i}\right)$ . \begin{align}
P(X = x \Big \vert N = n) & = \frac{P(X = x, N = n)}{P(N = n)}  \\\\ 
& = \frac{P(X = x)}{P(N = n)} \\\\ 
& = \left( \frac{e^{-\sum \lambda_i} \prod \lambda_i^{x_i}}{\prod x_i!} \right) \Bigg / \left( \frac{e^{-\sum \lambda_i} (\sum \lambda_i)^{n}}{n!} \right) \\\\ 
& = {n \choose x_1, ..., x_k} \frac{\prod \lambda_i^{x_i}}{\left( \sum \lambda_i \right)^n} \\\\ 
& = {n \choose x_1, ..., x_k} \left( \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum \lambda_i} \right)^{x_i} \\\\ 
& \sim \text{Multinomial}(n, k, \pi).
\end{align} Since no information was given to us about how it came about that $n = 43$ cookies
were given out, let's assume that it was the result of a $\text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ process.
This implies that the $X_i$ are independently and identically distributed
as $\text{Poisson}(\lambda/10)$ by a similar argument in the reverse direction. $$P(X = x \Bigg| \sum X_i = n) = \frac{P(X = x, \sum X_i = n)}{\underbrace{P(\sum X_i = n)}_{\text{Poisson}(\lambda)}},$$ and $X = x \implies \sum X_i = \sum x_i = n$ , so $P(X = x, \sum X_i = n) = P(X = x)$ as
long as $n = \sum x_i$ . \begin{align}
\therefore \;\; P(X = x) & = P(X = x \Bigg| \sum X_i = n) \cdot P(\sum X_i = n) \\\\ 
& = \left[ {n \choose \pi_1, ..., \pi_k} \prod \pi_i^{x_i} \right] \cdot \left( \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{\sum x_i}}{\sum x_i! } \right) \\\\ 
& = \frac{n!}{x_1!\cdots x_k!} \pi_1^{x_1}\cdots \pi_k^{x_k} \left( \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{n}}{n!} \right).
\end{align} Assume as given in the problem that the
cookies are uniformly randomly given out, and $\pi_i = \pi_{i'}\;  \forall i, i' \in \{ 1, ..., k \}$ ; this
single probability must be $1/k$ (or in our case, $k = 10$ children). \begin{align}
P(X = x) & = \frac{e^{-\lambda}}{x_1! \cdots x_k!} \left( \frac{\lambda}{k} \right)^{\sum x_i} \\\\
& = \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{e^{-\lambda/k} \left( \frac{\lambda}{k} \right)^{x_i}}{x_i!}, \\\\ 
\text{a product of the }&\text{density for $k$ iid Poisson}\left(\frac{\lambda}{k}\right) \text{ variables}.
\end{align} We said that if $n$ cookies are given out, then there's a $p_n$ probability
that the 10 children all receive 2+ cookies. Then without conditioning on the number of cookies given out, the probability that all kids receive 2+ cookies is given by $$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}[p_n | N = n]\right] = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^n}{n!} p_n.$$ On the other hand, since the $X_1, ..., X_k$ are iid Poisson, the probability
that all 10 kids
receive 2+ cookies is $P(X_1 \geq 2)^{10} = (1-P(X_1 \leq 1))^{10} = 
(1-e^{-\frac{\lambda}{10}} - \frac{\lambda}{10}e^{-\frac{\lambda}{10}})^{10}$ . Now we have that $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^n}{n!} p_n = 
\left[1-e^{-\frac{\lambda}{10}} - \frac{\lambda}{10}e^{-\frac{\lambda}{10}}\right]^{10}.
$$ Now, recall that $e^{x}$ has a series expansion. If we
multiply both sides by $e^{\lambda}$ and by $43!$ , we should find that the coefficient on the left-hand-side series for $\lambda^{43}$ is just $p_n$ , and the right-hand-side series coefficient for $\lambda^{43}$ gives an expression we can evaluate for $p_{43}$ .
They must be equal, because in order for two convergent power series
to coincide on a non-empty interval, their coefficients must be equal. So what we're going to do is expand the function $e^{x} = \sum_{t=0}^\infty \frac{x^t}{t!}$ wherever we see it
on the modified right-hand-side and use that to identify the coefficient of $\lambda^{43}$ ,
which is $p_{43}$ . However, this is a bit hard to do by hand, so we'll use the symbolic algebra library sympy in Python to do it for us. # Python code
from sympy import symbols, exp, factorial, series, Pow

lambda_ = symbols('lambda')

inner_expression = 1 - exp(-lambda_/10) - (lambda_/10)*exp(-lambda_/10)

raised_expression = inner_expression**10 

complete_expression = exp(lambda_) * raised_expression

expanded_series = series(complete_expression, x=lambda_, n=44).removeO()

coeff_lambda_43 = expanded_series.coeff(lambda_**43)

p_43 = factorial(43) * coeff_lambda_43
p_43 $$\frac{38360235213946776318553037176114920309}{78125000000000000000000000000000000000} \approx 0.491
$$ Thus we conclude that if 43 cookies are given out to 10 children uniformly at random, then
the probability that each child receives at least 2 cookies is $\approx .491.$ Let's see if we can confirm that via a simple simulation in R: # R code
set.seed(1234)

num_trials <- 100000  # Number of simulations
num_children <- 10    # Number of children
num_cookies <- 43     # Number of cookies

This has been bothering me because of how simply it has been stated, however even after hours of work I am not close to proving this mathematically. Geometrically the statement (*) is true, as seen below. $\hspace{4cm}$ Here are some estimates: From reverse triangle inequality, $|z^2+1| \le 2$ implies $|z| \le \sqrt{3}$ with equality at $z=i\sqrt{3}$ . From triangle inequality, $|z^3+3z+2| \le |z|^3+3|z|+2 \le 6\sqrt{3}+2 \approx 12.4$ . A better bound can also be achieved by factorization, $$|z^3+3z+2| = |z(z^2+1)+2(z+1)| \le |z||z^2+1|+2(|z|+1) \le 4\sqrt{3}+2 \approx 8.93. $$ Another approach I took was to show that for any $r<6$ , $$\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z^2+1|\le 2 \} \nsubseteq \{z \in \mathbb{C} : |z^3+3z+2|\le r \}  $$ which explains the pinching behavior between the sets near the point $(1,0)$ .

4915763,Conjectured connection between $e$ and $\pi$ in a semidisk.,"A semidisk with diameter $\dfrac{e}{\pi}n$ is divided into $n$ regions of equal area by line segments from a diameter endpoint. Here is an example with $n=6$ . Consider the $n$ arcs between neighboring line segment endpoints. Let $P(n)=\text{product of arc lengths}$ . Is the following conjecture true: Conjecture: $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(n)=\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ In other words, if the average arc length is $\color{red}{\dfrac{e}{2}}$ then the product of arc lengths approaches $\color{red}{\dfrac{\pi}{2}}$ . Evidence for my conjecture I got the following approximations. $P(1)\approx 1.359$ $P(2)\approx 1.438$ $P(3)\approx 1.469$ $P(6)\approx 1.507$ $P(12)\approx 1.528$ $P(24)\approx 1.543$ $P(48)\approx 1.552$ $P(96)\approx 1.558$ It seems that if the average arc length is less than $\dfrac{e}{2}$ then the product approaches $0$ , and if the average arc length is greater than $\dfrac{e}{2}$ then the product approaches $\infty$ . What makes this difficult What makes my conjecture difficult for me to prove or disprove, is that I cannot find exact expressions for the arc lengths.

4915800,"Equivalent characterisation of the space $L^p_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is a non-empty open subset of $\mathbb R^n$?","Consider the euclidian space $\mathbb R^n$ , where $n \in \mathbb N$ is an arbitrary integer, equipped with the usual Lebesgue measure. Moreover, let $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^n$ denote an arbitrary non-empty open set. In most textbooks, the space $L^p_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$ is defined as follows: Definition . Given $1 \leqslant p < \infty$ , the space $L^p_{\operatorname{loc}}(\Omega)$ consists of all Lebesgue measurable functions $f : \Omega \to \mathbb R$ that satisfy $$ \int_K |f(x)|^p \, dx < \infty, $$ for every compact set $K \subset \Omega$ . Now, the following equivalent characterisation of $L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb R^n)$ is well known: $$ \tag{1} f \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb R^n) \iff f \, \chi_B \in L^p(\mathbb R^n), \quad \text{ for every ball } B \subset \mathbb R^n. $$ A simple proof. Suppose firstly that $f \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb R^n)$ and consider an arbitrary ball $B \subset \mathbb R^n$ . Clearly, $\overline B$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb R^n$ and it contains $B$ . Consequently, we obtain $$ \int_{\mathbb R^n} |f(x)|^p \, \chi_B(x) \, dx \leqslant \int_{\overline B} |f(x)|^p \, dx < \infty, $$ where the last inequality follows from the hypothesis $f \in L^p_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb R^n)$ . On the other hand, suppose now that $f \, \chi_B \in L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ , for every ball $B \subset \mathbb R^n$ and consider an arbitrary compact set $K \subset \mathbb R^n$ . It is well known that there exists $R > 0$ such that $K \subset B(0,R)$ . Therefore, it follows that $$ \int_K |f(x)|^p \, dx \leqslant \int_{B(0,R)} |f(x)|^p \, dx = \int_{\mathbb R^n} |f(x)|^p \, \chi_{B(0,R)} (x) \,dx < \infty, $$ where the last inequality follows from the hypothesis $f \, \chi_B \in L^p(\mathbb R^n)$ , for every ball $B \subset \mathbb R^n$ . Now comes my question. Question. Is it possible to build the analogous of $(1)$ to $\Omega$ instead of $\mathbb R^n$ ?

4915873,Perspective on Differentials Generating Transformations of Functions - with Fourier Transformations $e^{a\partial_x} f(x) = f(x+a)$,"An analytic function $f(x)$ can be transformed by the exponential of a differential operator.
The most known and easiest example is $
e^{a \partial_x} f(x) = f(x+a)
$ Generally this is shown by Taylor series.
Because $f$ is analytic it has a Taylor series $T^{\infty} [f,a](x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$ . Now the object $e^{a \partial_x}$ is interpreted by Taylor expansion: $e^{a \partial_x} f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a^n}{n!} \partial_x^nf(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!}a^n = T^{\infty} [f,x](a+x) = f(x+a)$ This is for example used in Quantum Mechanics:
By Noether-Theorem the momentum operator $\hat{p}$ generates translation.
In real space representation the momentum operator is a differential operator $\hat{p} = -i\hbar \nabla$ .
This leads us to $\psi(x+a) = e^{a \frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{p}}\psi(x)$ . The argument can be expanded to more then one dimension and I believe that the factors are simply for dimension and unitarity. From this simple case we can expand to more general differential operators for analytic and invertible functions $g$ : $e^{\frac{d}{dg(x)}}f(x) = f(G(x))$ Using $f(x) = f(g^{-1}(g(x)))$ , we can see that $G(x) = g^{-1}(g(x)+1)$ .
Because of Cauchy-Eulers differential equations, we may be interested in $e^{\frac{d}{d(ln(x)/a)}}=e^{ax\frac{d}{dx}}$ . So $G(x) = e^{a( lnx/a +1)}= e^a x$ , and $x \frac{d}{dx}$ gives us scaling instead of translation. Now the main content: I want to present an easier argument for the translation by exponentiation of differentiation and then use the same argument for the scaling operator. Based on the momentum operator argument, I will look at this operator in momentum space ( $k$ -space).
As Quantum Mechanics (and Fourier Transform) deals with Schwartz functions, so smooth and rapidly decreasing functions, this argument is just for a (very important) subspace of analytic functions. We need two pieces of information before the argument becomes evident:
Be $F(k) = \mathcal{F}(f(x))(k)$ the Fourier transform of f, given it exists and I will be making use of the unitary angular frequency convention. $1. \mathcal{F}(f(x+a))(k) = e^{ i a k} F(k)$ $2. \mathcal{F}(f'(x))(k) = ik F(k) $ $\implies$ $\mathcal{F}(e^{a\frac{d}{dx}} f(x))(k) = e^{a i k }F(k) = \mathcal{F}(f(x+a))(k)  \\ \implies e^{a \frac{d}{dx}} f(x) = f(x+a)$ The last step is also a property of Schwartz functions.
That I can transform the exponent as shown can be seen by examining the series representation.
I believe this to be a neat proof and would like to have some feedback on the argumentation, possible gaps and additional steps! Now as a last step, the application to the scaling operator. $3. \mathcal{F}(f(a x))(k) = \frac{1}{a} F(\frac{k}{a}), a>0$ $4. \mathcal{F}(xf'(x) )(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \mathcal{F}(x)(k) * \mathcal{F}(f'(x))(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} (i \sqrt{2\pi} \delta'(k) )*(ik F(k) ) = - (kF(k))' = - F(k) - k F'(k) = (-1-k\frac{d}{dk})F(k)$ $\implies$ $ \mathcal{F}(e^{a x\frac{d}{dx}} f(x))(k) = e^{-a-k\frac{d}{dk} }F(k) = e^{-a}F(e^{-a}k) \\ \iff e^{a x\frac{d}{dx}} f(x) = f(e^a x) $ Thanks for reading! I'm open to questions and comments, so I can close remaining argumentative gaps. I hope you liked my perspective on this transformation and find these ideas useful.","['fourier-transform', 'functions', 'solution-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'transformation']"

Background While working on a personal project, I came upon this definition from Wikipedia for the second fundamental form (lightly paraphrased): Let $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}(u,v)$ be a regular parametrization of a surface $S$ in $ℝ^3$ , where $\mathbf{r}$ is a smooth vector-valued function of two variables. It is common to denote the partial derivatives of $\mathbf{r}$ with respect to $u$ and $v$ by $\mathbf{r}_{u}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{v}$ . Regularity of the parametrization means that $\mathbf{r}_{u}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{v}$ are linearly independent for any $(u,v)$ in the domain of $\mathbf{r}$ , and hence span the tangent plane to $S$ at each point. Equivalently, the cross product $\mathbf{r}_{u} × \mathbf{r}_{v}$ is a nonzero vector normal to the surface. The parametrization thus defines a field of unit normal vectors $\mathbf{n}$ : $$
\mathbf{n} =\frac{\mathbf{r}_{u} × \mathbf{r}_{v}}{|\mathbf{r}_{u} × \mathbf{r}_{v}|}
$$ The second fundamental form is usually written as $$
\mathrm{I\!I} = L\,du^{2} + 2 M\,du\,dv + N\,dv^{2}
$$ where the coefficients $L$ , $M$ , and $N$ at a given point can be computed with the aid of the dot product as follows: $$
L = \mathbf{r}_{uu} ⋅ \mathbf{n}, \quad M = \mathbf{r}_{uv} ⋅ \mathbf{n}, \quad N = \mathbf{r}_{vv} ⋅ \mathbf{n}
$$ The surface $S$ with which I am dealing is is a smooth, closed, convex surface parametrized as $$
\begin{alignat}{3}
X(θ, φ) &= \sin(θ) ⋅ \cos(φ)\:& ⋅ &\:h(θ, φ) + \cos(θ) ⋅ \cos(φ)\:& ⋅ &\:h_θ(θ, φ) - \frac{\sin(φ)}{\sin(θ)} ⋅ h_φ(θ, φ), \\

Z(θ, φ) &= \cos(θ)\:& ⋅ &\:h(θ, φ) - \sin(θ)\:& ⋅ &\:h_θ(θ, φ),
\end{alignat}
$$ given a support function $h(θ, φ)$ and its partial derivatives $h_θ(θ, φ) = \frac{∂ h}{∂ θ}$ and $h_φ(θ, φ) = \frac{∂ h}{∂ φ}$ , with spherical coordinates $0 ≤ θ ≤ π$ and $0 ≤ φ ≤ 2 π$ . I also know that the unit normal vector of $S$ at a point $P(u, v) = \bigl(X(u, v), Y(u, v), Z(u, v)\bigr)$ is $$
\mathbf{n}(u, v) = \bigl(\sin(u) ⋅ \cos(v), \,\sin(u) ⋅ \sin(v), \,\cos(u)\bigr)
$$ From all of the above, and with the help of WolframAlpha, I've worked out that $$
\begin{align}
L &= -h(u, v) - h_{uu}(u, v), \\
M &= \cot(u) ⋅ h_{u}(u, v) - h_{uv}(u, v), \\
N &= -\sin(u)^2 ⋅ h(u, v) - h_{vv}(u, v)  - \cos(u) ⋅ \sin(u) ⋅ h_{u}(u, v)

Are they just there as a reminder that, for example, $L$ is a product of the second derivative of $h$ with respect to $u$ , without actually indicating a mathematical operation to be carried out on $L$ ?

EDITED: I managed to prove the following : We define the Hamiltonian (H) for our system: $$ H = \lambda(t) \left(-x(t) - 25u(t) - \frac{1}{4}x(t)u(t)\right) + \mu u(t), $$ where $\lambda(t)$ is the constant (or adjoint cost) multiplier and $\mu$ is the multiplier associated with the constraint $\int_0^T u(t) \, dt = 1$ . The maximum principle states that the optimal control $u^*(t)$ maximizes the Hamiltonian $H$ at each time instant $t$ : $$ u^*(t) = \arg\max_{0 \leq u \leq 1} H. $$ We calculate the derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to $u$ $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial u} = \lambda(t) \left(-25 - \frac{1}{4}x(t)\right) + \mu. $$ The decision of whether $u(t) = 0$ or $u(t) = 1$ at a given moment depends on the sign of the derivative $$ \frac{\partial H}{\partial u} = \lambda(t) \left(-25 - \frac{1}{4}x(t)\right) + \mu $$ $$\frac{\partial H}{\partial u} > 0 \implies u^*(t) = 1$$ $$\frac{\partial H}{\partial u} < 0\implies u^*(t) = 0$$ I'm not really sure about the last two statements. However I don't know how to conclude the problem. Please help. Thanks in advance!","['optimal-control', 'optimization', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

4916068,Can the Euclidean unit interval have a finer connected topology?,"Consider the unit interval $X = [0,1]$ equipped with the Euclidean topology $\tau_E$ , and consider some other topology $\tau_F$ on $X$ that is strictly finer than $\tau_E$ . Does there exist such a topology $\tau_F$ for which $(X,\tau_F)$ is a connected space? I suspect there is either 1) a simple, abstract way of showing this topology cannot exist, or 2) a somewhat complicated example showing it can exist. PARTIAL RESULTS: Consider a process by which (at least) one subset of $X$ is added to the Euclidean topology to form $\tau_F$ . No such subset could be a finite subset of $X$ , as finite subsets of $X$ are closed with respect to the Euclidean topology and therefore clopen in $(X,\tau_F)$ , disconnecting the space. Therefore, $\tau_F$ cannot contain any finite subsets of $X$ . Now consider adding (at least) one subset interval of $X$ that is not in $\tau_E$ to $\tau_E$ to form $\tau_F$ . Such a subset cannot be an open interval, as this is already included in $\tau_E$ . Such a subset cannot be a closed interval, and the resulting set would be clopen in $\tau_F$ , disconnecting the space. Lastly, it cannot be a half-open interval $[a,b)$ or $(a,b]$ , as the space can always be split into two disjoint open sets of $\tau_F$ of the following form: $$X = [0,a)\cup\left([a,b)\cup(\frac{a+b}{2},1]\right) = [0,a)\cup[a,1]$$ or $$X = \left([0,\frac{a+b}{2})\cup(a,b]\right)\cup(b,1] = [0,b]\cup(b,1]$$ As a result, $\tau_F$ must also not contain any half-open/half-closed or closed intervals.","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
4916102,Justification for differentiation under integral,"Given a function I seek to find its derivative $$f(x) = \int_{\frac{1}{x}}^{\frac{e^x}{x}} \frac{\cos(xt)}{t} \, dt, \quad (x>0)$$ My question is regarding the justification of the differentiation under the integral sign rather than how to do it.
The theorems that I have at hand are the following. $\textbf{Theorem 1}$ Let $[a,b]$ compact interval, $J$ open interval, suppose that $f(x,t), \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x, t)$ continuous for $(x,t)\in [a,b]\times J$ . Then $F(t) = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x, t) \,dx\quad t\in J$ . $\textbf{Theorem 2 (For generalised domains)}$ Suppose there are majorants $g(x), h(x)$ such that $\left| f(x,t) \right| \le g(x), \left| \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x, t) \right| \le h(x)$ and $\int_Ig(x)\,dx < \infty,\quad \int_Ih(x)\,dx < \infty $ . We form $F(t) = \int_If(x,t)\, dx$ then $F(t)$ is differentiable and $F'(t) = \int_I\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(x, t) \,dx$ . Now if we come back to the function I gave as an example if $x<\infty$ then the interval is compact it is also clear that the integrand and its derivative are continuous on that interval hence differentiation is justified as I understand. Now consider $x \to \infty$ if we use the second theorem a possible majorant is $\frac{1}{t}$ but leads to $x<\infty$ . As I understand this is not possible as $x$ here is a variable. A similar issue occurs with bounding its derivative. Could anyone clarify what I am misunderstanding, or perhaps I am choosing the wrong majorants? Perhaps I have to assume that the interval is not generalised. Thanks for any ideas and clarifications!","['integration', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'derivatives']"

4916221,Proving a (Representing Utility) Function is Continuous,"This question was migrated from MathOverflow because it can be answered on Mathematics Stack Exchange. Migrated last month . I sincerely apologize for posting such a long question. The question involves a complicated proof of a theorem in mathematical economics. I feel it will be better for me to state my question first. I will add all related background information afterwards. So here is my question: I need to prove that a function $\alpha(x)$ is continuous at all $x\in\mathbb{R}^L_+$ . Since every point of $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ is a limit point, I could proceed to show that for any sequence $\{x^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ . So, consider a sequence $\{x^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ such that $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ . Suppose that I can show the sequence $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has a convergent subsequence. Moreover, suppose that I can show all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converge to $\alpha(x)$ . Does this imply that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ ? If so, why is that? As you can see, it seems that the proof below says ""yes"" to the above question. But I am confused, because every convergent subsequence converges to the same point does not necessarily imply the original sequence converges to that point (for example, consider the sequence $0,1,0,2,0,3,0,4,\dots$ ). I think we should instead prove that every subsequence of the original sequence converges to the same point. But I couldn't figure out how to do that. Am I missing anything? How should we fix this? Thanks a lot for any help! As I mentioned in the beginning, the question is from a proof of a theorem in mathematical economics. So let me state the theorem together with its proof in this section. In the next section, I will provide related notations and definitions. Theorem $\quad$ Suppose that the rational preference relation $\succsim$ on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ is monotone and continuous. Then there exists a continuous utility function $u(x)$ that represents $\succsim$ . Before we prove the theorem, we need a lemma. Lemma $\quad$ For a monotone, continuous, and rational preference relation $\succsim$ on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , $y\geq x$ implies $y\succsim x$ . Proof of lemma $\quad$ Let $\succsim$ be a monotone, continuous, complete, and transitive preference relation on $X=\mathbb{R}^L_+$ . Suppose first that $y\gg x$ ; that is, $y_i>x_i$ for all $i=1,\dots,L$ . Then by the definition of monotonicity, $y\succ x$ and thus $y\succsim x$ . Now suppose that $y_i=x_i$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,L\}$ and $y_k>x_k$ for all $k\neq i$ . (So $y\geq x$ .) Let $\{y^n\}$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ such that $y^n_k=y_k$ for $k\neq i$ and $y^n_i=y_i+\frac{1}{n}$ . Let $\{x^n\}$ be a sequence of points in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ such that $x^n_k=x_k$ for $k\neq i$ and $x^n_i=x_i+\frac{1}{n+1}$ . Then for each $n$ , $y^n_k = y_k > x_k = x^n_k$ and $y^n_i = y_i + \frac{1}{n} = x_i + \frac{1}{n} > x_i + \frac{1}{n+1} = x^n_i$ . Thus $y^n\gg x^n$ , and monotonicity implies $y^n\succ x^n$ , and so $y^n\succsim x^n$ . So we have constructed a sequence of pairs $\{(x^n,y^n)\}$ with $y^n\succsim x^n$ for all $n$ , $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ , and $y=\lim_{n\to\infty}y^n$ . Then continuity implies $y\succsim x$ . Now we prove the theorem. Proof $\quad$ We proceed our proof with the help of Figure 1. Denote the diagonal ray in $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ (the locus of vectors with all $L$ components equal) by $Z$ . It will be convenient to let $e$ designate the $L$ -vector whose elements are all equal to 1. Then $\alpha e\in Z$ for all nonnegative scalars $\alpha\geq0$ . By the above lemma, for every $x\in\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , we have $x\succsim 0$ . Also note that for any $\overline{\alpha}$ such that $\overline{\alpha}e\gg x$ (as drawn in the figure), we have $\overline{\alpha}e\succ x$ and so $\overline{\alpha}e\succsim x$ by monotonicity. Then, monotonicity and continuity can then be shown to imply that there is a unique value $\alpha(x)\in[0,\overline{\alpha}]$ such that $\alpha(x)e\sim x$ . Formally, this can be shown as follows: By continuity, the upper and lower contour sets of $x$ are closed. We show that the set $A^+ = \{\alpha\in\mathbb{R}_+:\alpha e\succsim x\}$ and $A^- = \{\alpha\in\mathbb{R}_+:x\succsim\alpha e\}$ are nonempty and closed. To see the nonemptiness of $A^+$ , note that for any $x=(x_1,\dots,x_L)\in\mathbb{R}_+$ , we can always choose an $\alpha' = \max\{x_1,\dots,x_L\}+1$ , so that $\alpha'e\succ x$ . Thus $A^+\neq\emptyset$ . To see the nonemptiness of $A^-$ , simply pick $\alpha''=0$ , so that $x\succsim0=\alpha''e$ would imply $A^-\neq\emptyset$ . We now prove the closedness of $A^+$ and $A^-$ . Let $\alpha$ be a limit point of $A^+$ . Then there exists a sequence $\{\alpha_n\}$ in $A^+$ such that $\alpha = \lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_n$ and $\alpha_ne\succsim x$ for all $n$ . Consider the sequence of pairs $\{(x,\alpha_ne)\}$ with $\alpha_ne\succsim x$ , $x = \lim_{n\to\infty}x$ , and $\alpha e = \lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_ne$ . By continuity, we have $\alpha e\succsim x$ , so that $\alpha\in A^+$ . Hence every limit point of $A^+$ is a point of $A^+$ , which means $A^+$ is closed. A similar argument would show that $A^-$ is closed. Finally, not that by completeness of $\succsim$ , $\mathbb{R}_+=(A^+\bigcup A^-)$ . Then the nonemptiness and closedness of $A^+$ and $A^-$ , together with the fact $\mathbb{R}_+$ is connected, imply that $A^+\bigcap A^-\neq\emptyset$ . Thus there exists a scalar $\alpha$ such that $\alpha e\sim x$ . Furthermore, by monotonicity, $\alpha_1e\sim\alpha_2e$ whenever $\alpha_1>\alpha_2$ . Hence there can be at most one scalar satisfying $\alpha e\sim x$ . This scalar is $\alpha(x)$ . We now take $\alpha(x)$ as our utility function; that is, we assign a utility value $u(x)=\alpha(x)$ to every $x$ . This utility level is also depicted in Figure 1. We need to check two properties of this function: that it represents the preference $\succsim$ (i.e., that $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ if and only if $x\succsim y$ ) and that it is a continuous function. That $\alpha(x)$ represents preferences follows from its construction. Formally, suppose first that $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ . Then either $\alpha(x)>\alpha(y)$ or $\alpha(x)=\alpha(y)$ . If $\alpha(x)>\alpha(y)$ , then $\alpha(x)e = (\alpha(x),\dots,\alpha(x)) \gg (\alpha(y),\dots,\alpha(y)) = \alpha(y)e$ . By the monotonicity, this implies that $\alpha(x)e\succ\alpha(y)e$ , and so $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . If $\alpha(x)=\alpha(y)$ , then $\alpha(x)e=(\alpha(x),\dots,\alpha(x)) = (\alpha(y),\dots,\alpha(y))=\alpha(y)e$ . The above lemma implies that $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . Therefore, $\alpha(x)e\succsim\alpha(y)e$ . Since $x\sim\alpha(x)e$ and $y\sim\alpha(y)e$ , we have $x\succsim y$ . Suppose, on the other hand, that $x\succsim y$ . Then $\alpha(x)e\sim x\succsim y\sim\alpha(y)e$ . Assume to the contrary that $\alpha(y)>\alpha(x)$ . Then $\alpha(y)e\gg\alpha(x)e$ , and monotonicity would imply that $y\sim\alpha(y)e\succ\alpha(x)e\sim x$ , a contradiction. Therefore, $\alpha(x)\geq\alpha(y)$ . (My question above essentially begins from here:) (Cont'd) We now argue that $\alpha(x)$ is a continuous function at all $x$ . Since every point of $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ is a limit point of $\mathbb{R}^L_+$ , we shall prove for any sequence $\{x^n\}$ with $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ , we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ . Hence consider a sequence $\{x^n\}$ such that $x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x^n$ . We note first that the sequence $\{\alpha(x^n)\}$ must have a convergent subsequence. By monotonicity, for any $\epsilon>0$ , $\alpha(x')$ lies in a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_+$ , $[\alpha_0,\alpha_1]$ , for all $x'$ such that $\|x'-x\|\leq\epsilon$ (see the figure below). Since $\{x^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $x$ , there exists an $N$ such that $\alpha(x^n)$ lies in this compact set for all $n>N$ . But any infinite sequence that lies in a compact set must have a convergent subsequence. What remains is to establish that all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\alpha(x)$ . To see this, suppose otherwise: that there is some strictly increasing function $m(\cdot)$ that assigns to each positive integer $n$ a positive integer $m(n)$ and for which the subsequence $\{\alpha(x^{m(n)})\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\alpha'\neq\alpha(x)$ . We first show that $\alpha'>\alpha(x)$ leads to a contradiction. To begin, note that monotonicity would then imply that $\alpha'e\succ\alpha(x)e$ . Now, let $\hat{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2}[\alpha'+\alpha(x)]$ . The point $\hat{\alpha}e$ is the midpoint on $Z$ between $\alpha'e$ and $\alpha(x)e$ (see the second figure). By monotonicity, $\hat{\alpha}e\succ\alpha(x)e$ . Now, since $\alpha(x^{m(n)})\to\alpha'>\hat{\alpha}$ , there exists an $\overline{N}$ such that for all $n>\overline{N}$ , $\alpha(x^{m(n)})>\hat{\alpha}$ . Hence, for all such $n$ , $x^{m(n)}\sim\alpha(x^{m(n)})e\succ\hat{\alpha}e$ (where the latter relation follows from monotonicity). Because preferences are continuous, this would imply that $x\succsim\hat{\alpha}e$ . But since $x\sim\alpha(x)e$ , we get $\alpha(x)e\succsim\hat{\alpha}e$ , which is a contradiction. The argument ruling out $\alpha'<\alpha(x)$ is similar. Thus, since all convergent subsequences of $\{\alpha(x^n)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ must converge to $\alpha(x)$ , we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha(x^n)=\alpha(x)$ , and we done.

Notation $\quad$ Let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}^N$ so $x=(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ and $y=(y_1,\dots,y_N)$ . Then (i) $x\geq y$ means $x_n\geq y_n$ for all $n=1,\dots,N$ ; (ii) $x\gg y$ means $x_n>y_n$ for all $n=1,\dots,N$ . Definition $\quad$ The preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$ is rational if it possesses the following two properties: (i) Completeness . For all $x,y\in X$ , we have $x\succsim y$ or $y\succsim x$ (or both). (ii) Transitivity . For all $x,y,z\in X$ , if $x\succsim y$ and $y\succsim z$ , then $x\succsim z$ . Definition $\quad$ The preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$ is monotone if $x\in X$ and $y\gg x$ implies $y\succ x$ . Definition $\quad$ The preference relation $\succsim$ on $X$ is continuous if it is preserved under limits.

4916314,constraints on the sum and product of roots of quadratic equation assuming less than unity roots,"I am solving a math contest problem. Assume we have the quadratic equation $x^2+a_1x+a_2=0$ where $a_1,a_2\in \mathbb{R}$ are real numbers. The roots of this equation can be found as (from equation it can be inferred that $a_1 = -(p_1+p_2), a_2 = p_1p_2$ ) $$p_1,p_2 = -\frac{a_1}{2}\pm \sqrt{\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_2}$$ Now assume that $|p_1|< 1, |p_2|< 1$ , in other words the module of the roots is lesser than unity (in the case of real roots, it translates to the fact that their absolute value is less than one). The claim is twofold $|a_2| < 1$ $|a_1| < a_2+1$ proving the first one very easy since $|a_2|=|p_1p_2| \le |p_1||p_2|< 1$ . However, the second one is almost impossible to prove! If we assume the roots are real, then by using $|p_i|< 1$ we can say $$-1< -\frac{a_1}{2}\pm \sqrt{\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_2}< 1 \Rightarrow -1+\frac{a_1}{2} < \pm \sqrt{\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_2}< 1 + \frac{a_1}{2}$$ then this gives two inequalities which can be manipulated to get similar results with a lot of mental gymnastics!

Thank you! =================================Edit=============================== For the complex conjugate pair, we can write $p_1 = p_r+ip_i, p_2 = p_1-ip_i$ and by substitution we get two true statements $$(1+p_r)^2+p_i^2 > 0 , (p_r-1)^2+p_i^2 > 0$$ and this prove the complex case.

I see that the irrationals are all local minimum and that in particular the natural numbers are all local maximum. Now, I convinced myself that any other rational is indeed also a local maximum.

It seems that if $a<e$ then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(a,n)=\infty$ , and if $a>e$ then $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}P(a,n)=0$ . So $a=e$ seems to be a critical value.

What makes this difficult What makes my question difficult for me, is that I cannot find exact expressions for the lengths.

The function $f$ has a total of five zeros (counting multiplicities) in the closed half-disc $\overline{\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{D}} = \{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \leq \frac{1}{2}\}$ . How large can $|f'(0)|$ be? Schwarz Lemma $f: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C}$ is analytic with $f(0) = 0$ and $|f(z)| \leq 1$ on $\mathbb{D}$ , then $|f(z)| \leq |z|$ for all $z \in \mathbb{D}$ and $|f'(0)| \leq 1$ It would be almost indisputable that Schwarz lemma will be of use here. Now, given that $f$ has five zeros in the domain $\overline{\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{D}}$ , it's no question that Rouche's theorem will likely also be of use here. Since $f$ maps $\mathbb{D}$ to itself, then implicitly we also have $|f(z)| \leq 1$ for $z$ on $\mathbb{D}$ . Then $f$ satisfies Schwarz's lemma, and so an upper bound for $|f'(0)|$ is $1$ .

From this one can substitution to arrive at $e^{\frac{t}{g'(x)}\frac{d}{dx}}f(x) = f(G_t(x))$ with $G_t(x) = g^{-1}(g(x)+t)) \quad \quad \mathbf{(1)}$ The user LL 3.14 presented another perspective, that is seemingly more known to arrive at another general form of this transformation by exponentiation. It utilizes differential equations instead of power series:
Let's define the solution to $\partial_t h = A h$ with $h(0) = f$ at time $t$ to be given by $h(t) := e^{t A}f \quad \quad \mathbf{(2)}$ I now want to show that both approaches lead to the same results. I want to transform $f \mapsto f \circ G$ via the exponent given in $(1)$ , they give this solution by $h(x,t)$ .
Leading me to $h(x,t)= f(G_t(x)) \quad \quad \mathbf{(3)}$ . I will know try to show that this form of $h$ solves the characteristic equations: $\partial_t h = \partial_t f(G_t(x)) = f'(G_t(x)) \partial_t G_t(x) =  \frac{f'(G_t(x))}{g'(G_t(x))}$ $A h = \frac{1}{g'(x)}\frac{d}{dx} h(x,t) = \frac{1}{g'(x)} f'(G_t(x)) \frac{g'(x)}{g'(G_t(x))} = \frac{f'(G_t(x))}{g'(G_t(x))}$ $h(t=0) = f(G_0(x))$ with $G_0(x) = g^{-1}(g(x))) = x$ So they are the same. I used $f'(u)$ to refer to the total derivative in dependency of one parameter $u$ .
The differentiation for $t,x$ is analogous, as it depends only linearly in $t$ but from $g(x)$ the second calculation includes an additional $g'(x)$ to the $\frac{1}{g'(G_t)}$ factor. The given variant relys on $g$ being an invertible and differentiable function (as almost all differentiable functions are localy invertible, this is enough for my purpose). That $g \in C^1$ has to be assumed to make sense of $\frac{d}{dg}$ , which is the core idea leading me to this observations. The case that $g$ is not invertible in an enviroment arount $0$ , $g=\, const.$ , can easily be dealt with as a special case. Now I have convinced myself that both formulations are equivalent, but are you, dear reader, satisfied with this 'proof'?
What am I missing? I have a few question left: Is my form of $h(x,t) = f(G_t(x))$ the only possible choice (for $A$ depending on differential operators and invertible functions) It should be, as the solution to the differential equation should be unique, as well as the description described by $g$ and $A$ !? *What properties should the operator $A$ has? It doesn't need to be hermitian or bounded as can be seen by the example, the defining differential equation is linear... I hope the used function spaces are clear from their use, just assume what is necessary. If there is something special about these assumptions you can note them.

This result confuses me a lot. First, I expect them to be equal because both $x_{(i)}$ and $y_{(i)}$ from the same Beta distribution as discussed above. Second, even if $\; \mathbb{E}_1 \neq \mathbb{E}_2$ , since $y_{(1)}$ could be greater than $y_{(2)}$ , $\displaystyle\int_{y_{(1)}}^{y_{(2)}} (f(t)-c)^2 \; dt$ could be negative for some $y_{(i)}$ .

Numerical investigation led me to the following claim: If $a=\frac{3\sqrt3}{2e}$ then as $n\to\infty$ the product of the arc lengths converges to unity. This claim is equivalent to the claim about the integral in this question. Edit I made a calculation mistake (in one step I used the diameter instead of the radius). So it is not true that ""If $a=\frac{3\sqrt3}{2e}$ then as $n\to\infty$ the product of the arc lengths converges to unity"" (and that claim is not equivalent to the claim in this question).

4917007,Confusion of definition of covariant derivative along curve,"I am currently studying Riemannian geometry, and have come across the following proposition: Proposition. Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold with Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ and let $\gamma:I\to M$ be a $C^1$ -curve in $M$ . Then there exists a unique operator $$\frac{\mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{d}t}:C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)\to C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M),$$ such that for all $\lambda,\mu\in\mathbb{R}$ , $f\in C^\infty(I)$ , $X,Y\in C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}(\lambda X+\mu Y)}{\mathrm{d}t}=\lambda\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}+\mu\frac{\mathrm{D}Y}{\mathrm{d}t}$$ $$\frac{\mathrm{D}(fX)}{\mathrm{d}t}=f'X+f\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}$$ for each $t_0\in I$ , there exists an open subinterval $J$ of $I$ such that $t_0\in J$ and if $\bar{X}\in C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ is a vector field with $\bar{X}_{\gamma(t)}=X(t)$ for all $t\in J$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)=(\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}}\bar{X})_{\gamma(t_0)}.$$ In the above, $C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ refers to all smooth vector fields along $\gamma$ , i.e. smooth $X:I\to\mathrm{T}M$ with $\pi\circ X=\gamma$ , and $C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ refers to all smooth vector fields on $M$ . My problem with this proposition is that I don't quite think 3 makes sense, and I'm trying to figure out what it should be or how it should be interpreted. To see my problem, note first that the Levi-Civita connection on $(M,g)$ is a map \begin{align*}
\nabla:C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)\times C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)&\to C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M), \\
(X,Y)&\mapsto \nabla_XY.
\end{align*} Consequently the expression $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\bar{X}$ does not make sense, as $\dot\gamma$ is not in $C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ . Even identifying $\dot\gamma$ with $t\mapsto(\gamma(t),\dot\gamma(t))$ we still only have a vector field along $\gamma$ , i.e. an element of $C^\infty_\gamma(\mathrm{T}M)$ . So the only way to try to make sense of this is to try to interpret $\dot\gamma$ as a vector field on $M$ . If $\gamma$ is injective, this is not a problem. Simply note that $\gamma(I)$ defines a submanifold of $M$ locally, and so we can extend the map $\gamma(I)\to\mathrm{T}M$ , $p\mapsto(p,\dot{\gamma}(\gamma^{-1}(p))$ to a vector field on $M$ locally around each point, and this vector field would then take the place of $\dot\gamma$ in $\nabla_{\dot\gamma}\bar{X}$ , and everything would make sense. The problem is, however, that if we do not assume $\gamma$ to be injective, we may have self-intersections, and for a given point $p\in\gamma(I)$ with $t_1,t_2\in I$ such that $\gamma(t_1)=\gamma(t_2)=p$ , we may have that $\dot{\gamma}(t_1)\neq\dot{\gamma}(t_2)$ , meaning that the above construction would be ill-defined. So to get around this, I assume the point is to choose $J\subseteq I$ sufficiently small so that $\gamma\vert_{J}$ is injective, and then do the above construction locally. Is this what is meant by the above? So could be write 3 instead as for each $t_0\in I$ , there exists an open subinterval $J$ of $I$ such that $t_0\in J$ , $\gamma\vert_J$ is injective, and if $\bar{X}\in C^\infty(\mathrm{T}M)$ is a vector field with $\bar{X}_{\gamma(t)}=X(t)$ for all $t\in J$ , we have $$\frac{\mathrm{D}X}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)=(\nabla_{\dot\gamma\circ(\gamma\vert_J)^{-1}}\bar{X})_{\gamma(t_0)}.$$ or something along those lines?","['riemannian-geometry', 'vector-fields', 'connections', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
4917018,Understanding the Series Summation: $\alpha+2\alpha^2+3\alpha^3+...=\frac{\alpha}{(\alpha-1)^2}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Formula for the summation of the series $a+2a^2+3a^3+...$ upto nth term? [duplicate] (4 answers) Closed last month . I've been working on understanding series and their summations, and I came across this particular series: $$\alpha+2\alpha^2+3\alpha^3+...$$ The solution provided states that the sum of this series is $$\frac{\alpha}{(\alpha-1)^2}$$ , but I'm having trouble understanding why this is the case. My Work: I tried to approach this problem by comparing it to the geometric series summation formula, which is $$\frac{a}{1-r}$$ where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio. However, I'm not sure how to apply it here since the coefficients of $$\alpha$$ are increasing. Background: I'm currently an undergraduate student taking a course in Calculus II. We've covered sequences and series, including geometric series and the tests for convergence. Definitions: Here, $$\alpha$$ is a real number and the series is presumably infinite. I would appreciate any help or guidance on how to approach this problem. Thank you in advance!","['summation', 'sequences-and-series']"

I am asked to solve the differential equation $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2x^2-xy+y^2}{y-x}.$$ Note that this is non-linear, non-homogeneous, non-exact, and inseparable for variables $x$ and $y$ . This is a problem on my final exam. I gave attempts to test for known form of equations and substitutions but they yield nothing.","['calculus', 'derivatives', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
4917067,the smallest volume of the cube that can contain 9 unit volume cubes,"I have been thinking about this question for some time now. If the question was about 8 cubes, the answer is obvious as we can just fit them inside a cube of side $2cm$ and hence volume $8cm^3$ . However, how can we add another cube to this with minimal volume increase in the larger cube? I came up with an answer that is less than the obvious $27cm^3$ . What I did was trying to reduce the problem to 2 dimensions and think of how large does a unit square has to be so that I can fit 5 unit squares in it. Well, I can put four squares in the corners of the larger square and I can fit a square in the middle with the vertices of those squares touching the middle of the side of the central square (I attached my drawing to represent it). This gives a side of the square measuring $(2 + \sqrt2/2)cm$ (simple calculation). This is less than the obvious answer of $3cm$ . Now we can translate this idea to three dimensions and make a cube where we place one unit cube on each vertex of the large cube, and in the bottom (take 4 cubes touching the same face) we place a unit cube so that it touches the bottom face as well forming the solution I found for 2d. This gives us a solution of $(2 + \sqrt2/2)^3 cm^3$ which is less than the obvious $27cm^3$ . So here is the question: can I prove this solution is optimal? First, I did not find a way to prove that the 2d solution is optimal, even though intuitively it seems like it is. The total area of the square required for my solution is approximately $7.33$ , so the ""remaining"" area not covered by squares (approximately $2.33$ ) gives ""room"" for another square to fit if there is an arrangement allowing it. Secondly, if I prove the solution in 2d is optimal, I could only say that the 3d ""translation"" of the 2d idea is also optimal if the projected vision in each face of the cube resulted in the optimal 2d solution. But such is not the case. But intuitively it seems to me that this is also the optimal solution for 3d. Is there a way to prove it? Thanks in advance!","['geometry', '3d']"
4917084,A parent wants to give his horses to their three children [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Mathematical Fallacy - The $17$ camels Problem. (2 answers) Closed last month . A parent leaves their horses to their three children in their will. The oldest gets half of the horses, the middle gets a third, and the youngest gets a ninth. The parent has $17$ horses so they couldn't be divided wholly according to their will. A friend of the parent solved this problem by lending one of their horses to make the total $18$ , so the oldest gets $9$ horses, the middle gets $6$ horses, and the youngest gets $2$ horses, and each gets a little more than they were entitled to. The remaining $1$ horse is returned to the parent's friend. What is wrong here? Solution: $\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{3}+\dfrac{1}{9}=\dfrac{17}{18}$ , so after giving away the horses to the children, there should be $\dfrac{1}{18}$ of the horses left, but after the parent's friend takes their horse back there is none left. I'm a bit confused by this word problem. Nothing seems wrong to me, and each child actually gets a little more than they were entitled to. Is the solution saying the friend of the parent should leave that last horse because according to the will $\dfrac{1}{18}$ of the horses are left untouched? But that horse originally belongs to the friend.",['algebra-precalculus']
4917107,$\lim_{x\to 0}\arcsin\left(\frac{\arccos\left(x\right)}{\pi}+\frac{\arccos\left(x^{2}\right)}{\pi}\right)$,"I'm trying to evaluate this: $$\lim_{x\to 0}\arcsin\left(\frac{\arccos\left(x\right)}{\pi}+\frac{\arccos\left(x^{2}\right)}{\pi}\right)$$ Now, calculating the for $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\arccos\left(x\right)}{\pi}$$ This should equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ And similarly, $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\arccos\left(x^2\right)}{\pi}$$ should equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ . And if I understand correctly, $\lim_{x\to 0}$ returns the actual value, not approximately, but the actual value that the function is approaching. So, here $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$ And, $$\arcsin\left(1\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}$$ which is my answer. Is this valid?
The answer given in my textbook is that the limit is not defined. But, I don't understand that.","['limits', 'calculus']"
