1112040,$\sec\theta$ never equals $\tan\theta$. Or does it?!?,"Wolfram-alpha is disagreeing with me. I am wondering why: which of us is wrong? I was writing a question to demonstrate why domains of functions matter. The question is: Does there exist an angle $\theta$ such that $\sec\theta=\tan\theta$ ? Then you get $\sin\theta=1$ and $\cos\theta\neq0$ (knowing to retain this inequality is the point of the question). These angles $\theta$ coincide (so $\theta=n\pi+\pi/2$ and also $\theta\neq n\pi+\pi/2$ ). We conclude that no such angle $\theta$ exists, so $\sec\theta\neq\tan\theta$ for all $\theta$ . However, WolframAlpha disagrees . Apparently, $\theta=2n\pi+\pi/2$ works (but not, for example, $3\pi+\pi/2$ ). What is going on here? Am I wrong? Does WolframAlpha use an odd definition for $\sec$ ? Do I use an odd definition for $\sec$ ? (I use $\sec=1/\cos$ , which I believe is standard. I have never heard of any other definition.) None of the above.","['trigonometry', 'wolfram-alpha']"
1112041,Laplacian and Hodge Laplacian,"I am new to the theory of differential forms, but there is one thing that I don't get at all. Imagine that you are on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ , then the Laplacian $- \Delta$ is known to be a continuous operator $L(W^k_2,W^{k-2}_2),$ where $W$ is the appropriate Sobolev space. Now, I found that there is also the concept of a De Rham Laplacian for manifolds, as you can see here for example on wikipedia. At this point, I read now that this one maps $k-$ forms to $k-$ forms. So how is this operator different from the Laplacian that I defined in the first place?- I thought that this definition is  a generalization of the Laplacian, but I can't see how these $k-$ forms are now related to the Sobolev space. So is this Hodge Laplacian something completely different or is this one related to my operator defined in the first paragraph?","['sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'real-analysis', 'differential-topology', 'functional-analysis']"

1112107,Why does Seifert-Van Kampen not hold with $n$-th homotopy groups?,"My question concerns the Seifert-Van Kampen theorem, in the following form. Let $X$ be an arch-wise connected topological space, consider a poin $x_{0}\in X$, and let $\{U_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ be an open covering by archwise-connected open subsets of $X$ such that $x_{0}\in U_{i}$ for all $i\in I$, and $U_{i}\cap U_{j}\in \{U_{i}\}_{i\in I}$ for all $i,j\in I$. For any two elements of the covering $U_{i}$, $U_{j}$ such that $U_{i}\subseteq U_{j}$, let $\phi_{ij}:\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})\longrightarrow \pi_{1}(U_{j},x_{0})$ be the map induced by the inclusion. Similarly, for any element of the covering $U_{i}$, let $\tau_{i}:\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})\longrightarrow \pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ be the map induced by the inclusion. Let $H$ be a group and $\rho_{i}:\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})\longrightarrow H$ any collection of homomorphisms defined for all $i\in I$ and such that if $U_{i}\subseteq U_{j}$ then $\rho_{i}=\rho_{j}\circ \phi_{ij}$. Then, there exists a unique homomorphism $\lambda:\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})\longrightarrow H$ such that $\rho_{i} = \lambda \circ \tau_{i}$, for all $i\in I$. Moreover, this universal mapping condition characterizes $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ up to a unique isomorphism. It is well-known that this statement does not always hold if we consider $n$-th homotopy groups with $n\geq 2$, and I believe that easy examples of this fact could be constructed. However, I would like to understand the intrinsic reason behind this phenomenon. We can roughly say that the proof of Seifert-Van Kampen is divided in two parts. (1) With the notation above, the group $\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$ is generated by the union of the images of $\pi_{1}(U_{i},x_{0})$ via the maps $\tau_{i}$. (2) For any $[\alpha]\in\pi_{1}(X,x_{0})$, consider the decomposition $[\alpha]=  [\alpha_{1}]...[\alpha_{n}]$ given in point (1). Then the morphism $\lambda([\alpha])=\rho_{1}([\alpha_{1}])...\rho_{n}([\alpha_{n}])$ is well-defined. Which one of the two parts fails with $n$-th homotopy groups? Why?","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

1112147,The union of finite sets is a finite set,"The union of two finite sets is a finite set. Let $X,Y$ be finite sets. That means that there are $n, m\in \omega$ such that $X \sim n$ and $Y \sim m$, i.e. there are functions $f: X \overset{\text{bijective}}{\rightarrow} n$, $g: Y \overset{\text{bijective}}{\rightarrow} m$. Then we distinguish the cases: $X \bigcap Y=\varnothing$ and $X \bigcap Y \neq \varnothing$. First case: $X \cap Y=\varnothing$ We define the function $h: X \cup Y \to m+l$ so that $h(x)=f(x)$ if $x \in X$, $h(y)=n+g(y)$ if $y \in Y$. We want to show that $h: X \cup Y \overset{1-1}{\to} n+m$ Let $a,b \in X \cup Y$ with $h(a)=h(b)$ if $a,b \in X$ then $h(a)=f(a)$ and $h(b)=f(b)$. Thus $f(a)=f(b) \Rightarrow a=b$ since $f$ is injective
$$$$ if $a,b \in Y$ then $h(a)=m+g(a)$ and $h(b)=m+g(b)$. Thus $m+g(a)=m+g(b) \Rightarrow g(a)=g(b) \Rightarrow a=b$ since $g$ is injective
$$$$ if $a \in X, b \in Y$ then $h(a)=f(a)<m$ and $h(b)=m+g(b) \geq m$, so in this case it cannot be that $h(a)=h(b)$ Then we show that $h: X \cup Y \to n+m$ is surjective. In order to do this, we need to show that $\forall k \in n+m$ there is a $b \in X \cup Y$
 such that $h(b)=k$. So it suffices to show that $\forall k<n$ there is a $x \in X$ such that $h(x)=k$ and $\forall n \leq k<n+m$ there is a $y \in Y$ such that $h(y)=k$. For $x \in X$: $h(x)=k \Rightarrow f(x)=k$ and we know that $\forall k<n, \exists x \in X$ such that $f(x)=k$ since $f$ is surjective. For $y \in Y: h(y)=k \Rightarrow n+g(y)=k$ How can we continue, knowing that the subtraction between natural numbers is not defined? Second case: $X \cup Y=(X-Y) \cup Y$ with $X-Y$ finite set , $Y$ finite set and $(X-Y) \cap Y=\varnothing$ so we reduce the problem to the first case. Also, how could we show that if $A$ is a finite set of finite sets then $\bigcap A$ is finite? The fact that $A$ is finite means that there is a natural number $n \in \omega$ such that $A \sim n$, i.e. there is a function $f: A \to n$ that is bijective. But what bijective function could we pick in this case in order to prove that $\bigcap A$ is finite? EDIT : The subsets of finite sets are finite sets. We consider a finite set $A$. That means that there is a natural number $n \in \omega$ such that $A \sim n$, i.e. there is a bijective function $f: A \to n$. Now we consider a subset $B$ of $A$. Then $f|_B: B \overset{\text{bijective}}{\to} f(B)$ So it suffices to show that $f(B) \sim m, m \in \omega$. $$B \subset A \rightarrow f(B) \subset f(A)=n \rightarrow f(B) \subset n$$ $f(B)=n$ then we are done. $f(B) \subsetneq n$ If $B=\varnothing$ we have the trivial bijection $g: B \to 0$ Now we suppose that $B \neq \varnothing$. We define a function $h: m \to f(B)$ such that $0 \mapsto \min{f(B)}\\k+1 \mapsto \min\{u \in f(B): u> h(k)\} $ It holds that $h(k)<n$. We will show that $h(k) \geq k$. For $k=0: h(0)= \min{f(B)}=\varnothing=0 \geq 0 \checkmark$ We suppose that $h(k) \geq k$. $$h(k+1)=\min{u \in f(B):u>h(k)}>k \geq k+1$$ Thus $k \leq h(k)< n \Rightarrow k<n$ and therefore $m \leq n$.",['elementary-set-theory']

1112198,$f$ is Riemann integrable iif the set of discontinuous points of $f$ has Lebesgue measure zero,"This is a well known result in mathematics, but it's my first time attempting to prove it. I'm following the second book of Analysis from Folland. Below are the notations used and the theorem, from the text. Now we have the following exercise, which is supposed to led us to prove the part b of this theorem. I managed to prove the part a of this exercise, but part b is hard to do. The best idea I have so far is to write for each $x\in[a,b]$, $$\lim_{\delta\to 0}\sup_{|x-y|\leq\delta}f(y) = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sup_{|x-y|\leq 1/n}f(y)$$ and note that $\sup_{|x-y|\leq 1/n}f(y) = M_i$ for some convenient partition chosen. In fact, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we may choose the partition $P_n$ so it there is always a $M_i$ equal to $\sup_{|x-y|\leq 1/n}f(y)$.

1112208,Why a tensor product of $2\times 2$ unitaries cannot implement a $3\times 3$ unitary?,"Let $\{v_1, \dotsc, v_m\} \in \mathbb{C}^{2^n}$ be a set of orthonormal vectors. Define a map $R_m$ from $2^n \times 2^n$ to $m \times m$ matrices as follows:
$$R_m(M) := \sum_{i,j=1}^m (v_i^*M v_j) E_{ij}$$
where $E_{ij} := e_i e_j^*$ is the all-zeroes matrix with entry 1 at position $(i,j)$. In other words, $R_m$ performs a unitary change of basis and then takes the top-left $3 \times 3$ block of the resulting matrix. For any $n \geq 2$, show that no matter how the vectors $\{v_i\}$ are chosen,
$$\mathrm{U}(3) \not\subseteq \bigl\{ R_3(U_1 \otimes \dotsb \otimes U_n) : U_i \in \mathrm{U}(2) \bigr\}.$$
That is, as matrices $U_i$ range over all possible $2 \times 2$ unitaries, their tensor product will never contain the set of all $3 \times 3$ unitaries in some basis. More generally, this should hold even if $2 \times 2$ unitaries are replaced by $d \times d$ unitaries and $m = 3$ is replaced by any $m > d$.

1112415,Way to show divisibility without using Euclid's lemma.,"The generalized version of Euclid's lemma states that if $k|mn$ and that $\gcd(k, m) = 1$ then $k|n$.

      \hfill 0 \hfill & \text{elsewhere} \\
  \end{cases}
$$
In our case, we have $\alpha = n$ and $\beta = 1/n$. Show that
$$X_n \overset{\mathbb{P}}{\to} 1$$ My try: We have to show that for every $\varepsilon>0$:
$$\mathbb{P}(|X_n - 1|<\varepsilon)=\mathbb{P}(-1+\varepsilon < X_n < 1-\varepsilon)=1$$
Thus:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(-1+\varepsilon < X_n < 1-\varepsilon) &= \int_{-1+\varepsilon}^{1-\varepsilon} f(x;n,1/n)\mathrm{d}x\\
&= \int_{0}^{1-\varepsilon}\dfrac{x^{n - 1}e^{-nx}}{\dfrac{1}{n^n}\Gamma(n)}\mathrm{d}x \\
&=\dfrac{n^n}{\Gamma(n)}\int_{0}^{1-\varepsilon} x^{n - 1}e^{-nx}\mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
Now make the substitution $x \mapsto nx$, this yields
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(-1+\varepsilon < X_n < 1-\varepsilon) &= \dfrac{n^n}{\Gamma(n)}\int_{0}^{n(1-\varepsilon)} \dfrac{1}{n}\left(\dfrac{x}{n}\right)^{n - 1}e^{-x}\mathrm{d}x \\ 
&= \dfrac{1}{\Gamma(n)}\int_{0}^{n(1-\varepsilon)} x^{n - 1}e^{-x}\mathrm{d}x
\end{align*}
Now, taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ we yield \begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}(-1+\varepsilon < X_n < 1-\varepsilon) &=\lim_{n \to \infty}\dfrac{1}{\Gamma(n)} \int_0^{n(1-\varepsilon)} x^{n - 1}e^{-x}\mathrm{d}x \\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty}\dfrac{\Gamma(n)}{\Gamma(n)} \\
&=1

Since $\varepsilon>0$ was given arbitrarily, we conclude that

1112441,"(Infinite) Nested radical equation, how to get the right solution?","I've been tasked with coming up with exam questions for a high school math contest to be hosted at my university. I offer the following equation,
$$\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x-\sqrt{x+\sqrt{x-\cdots}}}}=2$$

1112447,What's the point of the PoincarÃ© disc model?,"I'm trying to work out the point of the PoincarÃ© disc model (excuse the pun). As far as I can tell, it's a disc, on which the only permitted lines are a line straight across the middle, and arcs of circles that meet the edge of the disc at right angles (and segments of such arcs, so if I draw three of them together I can get a curvy-edged triangle), and hyperbolic circles (which is ""just"" the set of points that are a common distance from another point, but where distance is a newly defined kind of distance). We define new meanings for distance and area and such on the disc. So now I've got a disc on which I can draw some curves and say they are of length such-and-such (using my new definition of distance), and I can say a curvy triangle is of area such-and-such, and I can prove that various allowed lines will and will not touch/cross under various circumstances and so on. I've calculated various distances and mid-points and areas and reflections and so on. But I could come up with an infinite number of geometries by allowing lines of various types and defining length and area in my own special way (or can I?). What's so special about this disc that it's worth examining? I'm not averse to playing with new ideas just for fun, but this PoincarÃ© disc seems like a big deal, so it must be for more than the fun of it. Perhaps the clue is in the name; it's a PoincarÃ© disc model, so what's it a model of? I think if I have a hyperbolic space with some geodesics on it, I can project those geodesics onto a disc and the projections are the right shape to be allowed (i.e. arcs of circles meeting the edge of the disc at right-angles), but I don't see what that gets me that I didn't already know. Is there some link between the length of the line on the disc (as defined using my new special definition of length) that relates to the length of the geodesic in the original hyperbolic space? Can I look at the curves on the disc and from them know something about the curves in the hyperbolic space that I didn't know before?

This is the integral curve of $X$ through $p$. (apparently) we view $I$ as a manifold (why, what is $I$ precisely?) with coordinates $t$ then $d/dt$ is a tangent vector field on $I$ which acts on functions $f:I\rightarrow \mathbb R$. By definition the tangent vector to the curve is given by $\gamma '(t):= \gamma _* (d/dt)_{\gamma (t)}=X_{\gamma(t)}$. For local coordinates about $p\in M$
\begin{equation}
X_{\gamma(t)}(x^i)=\frac{d}{dt}\gamma ^*(x^i)=\frac{d}{dt}(x^i\circ \gamma)=\frac{d}{dt}\gamma^i(t)=\frac{d}{dt}x^i(t)

\begin{equation}
X_{\gamma(t)}(x^i)=X^j\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial x^j}\bigg|_{\gamma(t)}=X^i(\gamma (t))=X^i\{x^i(t)\}

Doing this for all points of $M$ we get the flow along $X$. The vector field generates the flow. My question is can anyone explain why this is different to a set of tangent vectors in the tangent space to $M$? Is the integral curve a function on $M$?

  if $a\geq9/8$ then $f'(x)\geq0$ for all $x$. My way of doing this is to first differentiate $f(x)$ so that:
$$f'(x)=a-\frac{x^2 (x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
thus if you assume that $a\geq9/8$ and since we know from above that $$a=f'(x)+\frac{x^2 (x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^2}$$
then 
$$ f'(x)+\frac{x^2 (x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^2}\geq \frac{9}{8}\;\; \rightarrow\;\;f'(x)\geq\frac{9}{8}-\frac{x^2 (x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^2}  $$
then all we need to show is that:
$$ \frac{9}{8}-\frac{x^2 (x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^2}\geq0 $$
which we can show since we can write this as:
$$\frac{1}{8}\left( \frac{x^2-3}{x^2+1} \right)^2\geq 0$$
which is obviously true since $x^2$ is greater than or equal to zero for all real $x$.

Prove there is no branch of arg z (and consequently no continuous complex logarithm) in the region $D^* =0 < |z| < 1$. Attempt at a proof: Assume there is a branch of arg $z$, i.e., there exists $\alpha : D^* \to [a,b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ such that $\alpha(z) = \text{arg} z$. Consider the path $\gamma : [0,1] \to D^*$ defined by $\gamma(t) = \frac{1}{2} e^{2 \pi i t}$. Then, clearly $\gamma(0) = \gamma(1)$. Moreover, the function $t \mapsto \alpha(\gamma(t)) = \text{arg}(\gamma(t))$ is a strictly increasing function.

1) First, I use the homogeneous differential $y'' - y'= 0$, which gives me the complementary solutions: $$y_c=c_1 +c_2e^x.$$
2) Next, I need to determine the solution using variation of parameters of form: $$y_p = u_1 + u_2 e^x$$
$$y'_p = u'_1 + u'_2e^x + u_2e^x$$
I set $u'_1 + u'_2e^x = 0$; thus, $$ y''_p = u'_2e^x+u_2e^x,$$
and substitute in to the original equation, $y'' - y' = e^x$:
$$ u'_2e^x+u_2e^x - u_2e^x = e^x$$
$$u'_2e^x = e^x$$
$$u'_2 = 1$$
And I can solve for the other expressions using substitution ($u'_2e^x = -u'_1$) and integration:
$$ u_2 = x, u'_1 = -e^x, u_1 = -e^x$$
And using $y_p = u_1 + u_2e^x = -e^x +xe^x$ and my value for $y_c$:

Then we have: $$a \notin D \leftrightarrow a \notin f(a) \leftrightarrow a \in D, \text{ contradiction}$$ Therefore for each $x \in A, f(x) \notin D$, i.e. $f$ is not surjective. Could you explain me the proof from the point where we assume that there is an $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=D$? We have show that $D \in \mathcal{P}A$ and we want to show that $D \notin f(A)$ in order to show that $\mathcal{P}A$ isn't the image of $f$.
Why do we do it like that? Why do we assume an $a \in A$ such that $f(a)=D$?",['elementary-set-theory']

Improve this question Suppose you have a set, $\mathbb{N}$, the set of natural numbers.The proof by contradiction is simply that you assume. $a = \sup \mathbb{N}$ The definition of $\sup = a$ would then be that. $a = \sup \mathbb{N} $ So by definition, $a \ge n$ But is it also true that? $a \ge n + \beta$ for any $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ ?","['elementary-number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
1113528,Compute a parallel transport,"Let $\mathbb{S}^{2} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3}$ be the $2$-sphere ($\mathbb{S}^{2} = \left\{ (x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3, \; x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 \right\}$). Let $p \in \mathbb{S}^{2}$ and $\xi \in T_{p}S^{2} = \left\{ p \right\}^{\perp} \simeq \mathbb{R}^2$. When I wanted to compute explicitly the parallel transport of $\xi$ along a geodesic $\gamma$ (such that $\gamma(0)=p$), I used the following ""trick"" : if $T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi)$ denotes the parallel transport of $\xi$ from the point $p$ to $\gamma(t)$, along $\gamma$, then : $$\forall t, \; T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi) \in T_{\gamma(t)}\mathbb{S}^{2}$$ and an orthogonal basis of $T_{\gamma(t)}\mathbb{S}^{2}$ is given by : $(e_{1}(t),e_{2}(t))=(\gamma'(t), \gamma(t) \wedge \gamma'(t))$. As a consequence, $T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi)$ writes : $$ \forall t, \; T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi) = \alpha(t) e_{1}(t) + \beta(t) e_{2}(t) $$ And, since the parallel transport is an isometry, $$ \left\langle T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi),\gamma'(t) \right\rangle = \left\langle \xi,\gamma'(0) \right\rangle = \alpha^{2}(t) \Vert e_{1}(t) \Vert^{2} \tag{1}$$ and $$ \Vert T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi) \Vert^{2} = \Vert \xi \Vert^{2} = \alpha^{2}(t) + \beta^{2}(t) \tag{2}$$ $(1)$ and $(2)$ allow to determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 
But I think the method does not generalize to higher dimension.. Here is my idea : If I want to compute the parallel transport in $\mathbb{S}^{3} \subset \mathbb{R}^{4}$ using the same method, I could determine an orthogonal basis of $T_{\gamma(t)} \mathbb{S}^{3}$, say $(e_{1}(t),e_{2}(t),e_{3}(t))$ and write : $$ T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi) = \alpha_{1}(t) e_{1}(t) + \alpha_{2}e_{2}(t) + \alpha_{3}(t) e_{3}(t) $$ but I don't know how I would determine $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$ since the relations $\left\langle T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi),\gamma'(t)\right\rangle = \left\langle \xi,\gamma'(0) \right\rangle$ and $\Vert T_{\gamma,0,t}(\xi) \Vert^{2} = \Vert \xi \Vert^{2}$ do not give enough information (mainly because two equations are not enough to determine the three $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$)... Is there a way out with this method or shall I compute the parallel transport by solving (when possible) the differential equation ?","['riemannian-geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

With the symbol $Nm_{\pi}$ we mean the norm application that takes a meromorphic function on $C^{'}$ named $h$ and produce a meromorphic function on $C$ named $Nm_{\pi}( h)$ defined as $$Nm_{\pi}(h)(p)=\prod_{q \in \pi^{-1}(p)} h(q)^{\nu(q)}$$ where $\nu(q)$ is the multiplicity of $q$ in the fiber of $p$ respect to $\pi$.
Write $(f)=(Nm_{\pi}(h))$ the principal divisor associated to the function $Nm_{\pi}(h)$. I would like to prove that: 1) if $\tau: C^{'} \rightarrow C^{'}$ is the sheet interchange involution for the double cover $\pi$. Show that there exist a function $s$ meromorphic on $C^{'}$ such that $$ s(q)=-s(\tau(q))$$
2)Let $\tau$ as in the point 1) and let $f$ a meromorphic function on $C^{'}$ such that $f=-f \circ \tau$. Show that $(Nm_{\pi}(f))$ is divisible by 2 i.e. we can write $(Nm_{\pi}(f))=2D$.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'complex-geometry']"
