933450,A limit ordinal $\gamma$ is indecomposable if and only if $\alpha + \gamma = \gamma$ if and only if $\gamma = \omega^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$. [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Indecomposable limit ordinals (3 answers) Closed 9 years ago . I am trying to prove ex 2.13 from Jech's book on set theory: Ex 2.13: A limit ordinal $\gamma$ is indecomposable if and only if $\alpha + \gamma = \gamma$ if and only if $\gamma = \omega^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha$. I think this is equivalent to proving that the 3 following statement are equivalent: $\gamma$ is indecomposable (i.e. there are no $\alpha,\beta < \gamma$ s.t. $\gamma = \alpha + \beta$). For every $\alpha < \gamma$, $\alpha + \gamma = \gamma$. There exists $\alpha$ s.t. $\gamma = \omega^{\alpha}$. I think that I can prove $(1) \rightarrow (3)$ since it seems almost straight forward from Cantor's normal form theorem. I can also prove that $(1) \Rightarrow (2)$ since, for every $\alpha < \gamma$, there exists a unigue $\delta$ s.t. $\alpha + \delta = \gamma$. Given, (1), $\delta \geq \gamma$. But $\delta > \gamma \Rightarrow \alpha + \delta > \gamma$ and we are left with $\delta = \gamma$. My problem is with the other directions. Any help?","['ordinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"
933453,"Evaluating $\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( \sin x \right )\,dx$","Good evening! I want to compute the integral $\displaystyle \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( \sin x \right )\,dx$.  However I find it extremely difficult. What I've tried is rewritting it as: $\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2\left ( \sin x \right )\,dx &=\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\left [  \ln \left ( \sin x \right )  \right ]^2\,dx \\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\left [ \ln \left ( \frac{e^{-ix}-e^{ix}}{2i} \right ) \right ]^2\,dx\\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\left [ \ln \left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right )-\ln 2i \right ]^2\, dx\\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\left ( \ln^2\left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right )-2\ln 2i \ln \left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right ) +\ln^2 2i\right )\,dx\\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3} \ln^2 \left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right )\,dx-2\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln 2i \ln \left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right )\,dx +\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 2i \,dx \\ 
\end{aligned}$ I wrote the first integral as:
$\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( e^{-ix}-e^{ix} \right )\,dx &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( e^{-ix}\left ( 1-e^{-2ix} \right ) \right )\,dx\\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( e^{-ix} \right )\,dx+\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2 \left ( 1-e^{-2ix} \right )\,dx\\  
\end{aligned}$ Now I used MacLaurin's Expasion of $\ln(1-x)$ for the second integral, so that I can express it as complex series, which is the following: $$\ln^2\left ( 1-e^{-2ix} \right )= \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-2ikx}}{k}\frac{e^{-2imx}}{m} \implies \int_{0}^{\pi/3}\ln^2\left ( 1-e^{-2ix} \right )\,dx=\int_{0}^{\pi/3}\left ( \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-2ikx}}{k}\frac{e^{-2imx}}{m} \right )\,dx$$ I'm pretty confident that I can alter summation and integral. I don't know if this can help. And this is where I stopped. I can't play around with the middle integral, because of that $\ln(2i)$ term which bothers me, otherwise I would apply the same technic with the MacLaurin expansion. Something also tells me that the last integral should be discarded. Because it's a complex one, but I have not dwelved in it further so I'm not quite sure if there are no cancellations with the other integrals I have, because they all contain complex parts. Any help would be appreciated. P.S: This is not homework.","['improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis']"

933515,Definition of continuous spectrum of a bounded operator,"Let $T$ be a bounded operator acting on a Banach space $X$. The point spectrum $\sigma_p(T)$ is of $T$ is defined to be $$\sigma_p(T):=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C~|~T-\lambda\text{ has nonempty kernel}\}$$ and the residual spectrum $\sigma_r(T)$ is defined to be $$\sigma_r(T):=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C~|~T-\lambda\text{ has empty kernel but Ran}(T-\lambda)\text{ is not even dense in }X\}.$$ 
For the continuous spectrum there seem to exist two non-equivalent definitions. For example, Dunford-Schwartz defines
$$\sigma_c(T):=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C~|~T-\lambda\text{ has empty kernel but Ran}(T-\lambda)\text{ is a dense proper subset of } X\}$$ whereas for example Kato or Schmüdgen define
\begin{align*}\sigma_c'(T)&:=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C~|~\text{Ran}(T-\lambda)\text{ is not a closed subset of } X\}\\
\sigma_r'(T)&:=\{\lambda\in\mathbb C~|~T-\lambda\text{ has a bounded inverse defined only on a proper subset of } X\}.
\end{align*} Does anyone have insights on the difference of these definitions? What are the advantages? The former one gives a partition of the spectrum, so that's kind of nice, but why is the second definition (more?) useful? Edit: I just created a table that categorizes parts of the spectrum in terms of the questions: Is $K_\lambda:=$Ker$(T-\lambda)$ zero or nonzero? Is $R_\lambda:=$Ran$(T-\lambda)$ closed or not? Is $R_\lambda:=$Ran$(T-\lambda)$ dense or not? According to this table the point spectrum can be subdivided into four subtypes and the residual spectrum can be subdivided into two subtypes. The alternative definitions would correspond to \begin{align*}\sigma_c'(T)&=\sigma_{c}(T)\cup\sigma_{r,1}(T)\cup\sigma_{p,2}(T)\cup\sigma_{p,3}(T)\\
\sigma_r'(T)&=\sigma_{r,1}(T)

    where $p$ is the Lebesgue pre-measure on the semiring $\mathcal{S}$ of all intervalls of the form $(a,b]$ defined by $p((a,b])=b-a$ and $p(\emptyset)=0$ on the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}(\lambda^*)$ of all sets that are $\lambda^*$-measurable.
    One says that $\lambda$ is the unique continuation of $p$ and especially $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})\subset\mathcal{M}(\lambda^*)$, i.e. all Borel sets are Lebesgue-measurable.
    So far so good. Now I have one (maybe very stupid) problem. If one has f.e. the intervall $(a,b)$ (which is in the Borel-$\sigma$-algebra and therefore formally it is Lebesgue-measurable) it is $$\lambda((a,b))=\lambda^*_{|\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})}((a,b))=b-a.
$$ Why? Is it right that calculating the Lebesgue-measure of a Borel-set is calculating the outer Lebesgue-measure in fact? So that writing $\lambda$ is in fact not very precisely? Instead one should write $\lambda^*_{|\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})}$. In which way is $\lambda=\lambda^*_{|\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})}$ a continuation of $p$, because $\lambda=p$ on $\mathcal{S}$?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
933579,"Two ways to evaluate $\int (\Delta u) v d\Omega$, two different results","I would like to evaluate the integral $\int (\Delta  u) v d\Omega$, where the domain $\Omega$ is a cylinder. On the boundaries, either the normal derivative $\partial_n u$ is zero or $v$ is zero. An additional assumption is that $u$ and $v$ are axial symmetric, ie. $\frac{\partial u}{\partial \phi} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \phi} = 0$. The two steps in the derivation below are partial integration of the second derivative, and using cylindrical coordinates for the nabla operator. However, the order seems to matter. Method 1 $\int (\Delta  u) v d\Omega$ Using Green's first identity this becomes $- \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v + \oint_{\partial \Omega} (\partial_n u)v$ where the second term disappears because of the boundary conditions
  assumed. With the expression for the gradient in cylindrical
  coordinates, $\nabla = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \rho}
\boldsymbol{\hat{\rho}}, \frac1{\rho}\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}
\boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\mathbf{\hat{z}}\right)$, and the dot product in the coordinates defined by the orthogonal (local) unit vectors $\boldsymbol{\hat{\rho}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}}, \boldsymbol{\hat{z}}$:
  $(\rho_1, \phi_1, z_1) \cdot (\rho_2, \phi_2, z_2) = \rho_1 \rho_2
+ \phi_1 \phi_2 + z_1 z_2$, the first term becomes: $-2 \pi \int \int d\rho dz \left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial \rho} + \frac1{\rho^2} \frac{\partial
u}{\partial \phi}  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \phi} +
\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right] $ or due to axial symmetry: $-2 \pi \int \int d\rho dz \left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho} \frac{\partial v}{\partial \rho}  + \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right]$ Or: Method 2 $\int (\Delta  u) v d\Omega$ With the Laplacian in cylindrical coordinates, $\Delta =
 \frac1{\rho}\frac{\partial}{\partial \rho} \left(\rho
 \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho}\right) + \frac1{\rho^2}
 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \phi^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}$
  this gives $2 \pi \int \int d\rho dz \left[ \frac1{\rho}\frac{\partial u}{\partial
 \rho} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \rho^2} +
 \frac1{\rho^2} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \phi^2} + \frac{\partial^2
 u}{\partial z^2}\right] v$ Applying now partial integration to the terms with a second derivative,
  eg. $\int \int d\rho dz \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \rho^2}v = \int
 dz \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho}v \right|_0^{\rho_{max}} -
 \int \int d\rho dz \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho} \frac{\partial
 v}{\partial \rho} = - \int d\rho dz \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho}
 \frac{\partial v}{\partial \rho}$ where the last step is due to axial
  symmetry and assumed boundary conditions. The resulting equation then
  is $2 \pi \int \int d\rho dz \left[\frac1{\rho} \frac{\partial
 u}{\partial \rho} v - \frac{\partial u}{\partial \rho} \frac{\partial
 v}{\partial \rho}  - \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \frac{\partial
 u}{\partial z}\right]$ Where now there is an additional term compared to method 1, and I don't see what I did wrong?","['multivariable-calculus', 'polar-coordinates']"

933597,When do functions turn a space into a locally ringed space?,"Let $X$ be a topological space, and consider for each open set $U \subseteq X$ a set $F_U$ of functions $U \to k$ into some fixed field $k$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the sheaf of $k$-algebras induced by those $F_U$, i.e. the smallest sub-sheaf of the sheaf of all functions into $k$, such that $F_U \subseteq \mathcal{O}(U)$ for all $U$. Suppose we know that for any open set $U$ and any $f \in F_U$ the set $D(f) \subseteq X$ of non-zeros of $f$ is open, and $\frac{1}{f} : D(f) \to k$ is an element of $F_{D(f)}$. Can we conclude that the same holds for all functions of $\mathcal{O}$, so that $(X,\mathcal{O})$ turns out to be a locally ringed space? I believe this is true, and I tried to prove it in an inductive way: Let $\mathcal{O}'$ consist of those functions $f$ of $\mathcal{O}$ for which $D(f)$ is open and $\frac{1}{f}$ is an element of $\mathcal{O}(D(f))$. If we could show that $\mathcal{O}'$ is a sheaf of $k$-algebras as well it would follow $\mathcal{O}'= \mathcal{O}$ by definition of $\mathcal{O}$, and hence the claim. Indeed, the sheaf-properties and most of the $k$-algebra-properties are easy to show but the closure property under addition makes trouble. How could we show that $D(f+g)$ is open, and that $\frac{1}{f+g}$ is an element of $\mathcal{O}$ if $f$ and $g$ are elements of $\mathcal{O}'$ with the same domain? Is it even true?

933603,Longest chord inside the intersection area of three circles,"I am currently working on my masters thesis in computer science and I stumbled onto a geometry problem. My goal is to compute the length of the longest possible chord inside the intersection area of three circles. I know the following thing about the circles: their radius is r Construction: Assume that there is a circle around a point c with size r . Then I choose two random points v1 and v2 inside this circle. These two points are the centers of the other two circles. This bounds the distance between the centers of the circles: length(c,v1) is at most r length(c,v2) is at most r length(v1,v2) is at most 2r Note that the points can be the same. So some of this distances can be 0. Therefore I will break this down into four cases: Case 1: (all points are the same, c=v1=v2) If all points are the same, the solution is trivial. The longest possible line inside a circle is the diameter. Case 2: (two points are the same) If two points are the same, I can compute the distance like this: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html Case 3: (three different points, but on a straight line) If the three points form a straight line, I can compute the distance like in the 2nd case. I just ignore the point that is located in the middle. Case 4: (the three points form a triangle) If the 3 centers form a triangle there will be three intersection points A,B and C which will form a triangle, too (correct me if I am wrong). To make things more clear lets rotate the situation without loss of generality.
Rotate the circle such that c is the topmost center. Let A be the intersection point closest to c. B and C follow in clockwise direction. Here is the situation: I tried to compute these values by constructing other triangles but I just can not find any solution. In some special cases I could find the angles of the triangle(A,B,C) but that didn't help me either. Is it even possible?

933683,Decay of Fourier Coefficients implies Holder Continuity?,"This is an exercise problem. I got stuck here and would like to get a hint. The problem is Suppose $f$ is continuous and $2\pi$-periodic, and $|\hat{f}(n)|\leq |n|^{-3/2}$ for all non-zero $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Prove that $f$ satisfies for any $x,y$: 
  $$|f(x)-f(y)|\leq 100|x-y|^{1/2}$$ I'm trying to proceed in the following way: since the Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, I will expand $f$ with the Fourier series: $$
\begin{aligned}
|f(x) - f(y) | &= \left| \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} (S_Nf(x) - S_Nf(y)) \right| \\
&\leq \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=-N}^N \left|\hat{f}(n)\right|\left|e^{inx} - e^{iny}\right| \\
&\leq \lim_{N\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{n=-N,n\neq 0}^N |n|^{-3/2} \left|e^{inx} - e^{iny}\right| \\
\end{aligned}
$$ Next I want to get some Holder continuity property for $e^{inx}$ in order to proceed: $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \sup_{x,y}\frac{\left| e^{inx} - e^{iny}\right|}{|x-y|^{1/2}} &=
        \sup_{x,y}\left( \frac{\left| e^{inx} - e^{iny}\right|}{|x-y|}

Please explain the $V$ formula. What does this mean? As  my knowledge, assume that $f(z)$ is histogram of gray level 1 to 256. and $\delta(z-I(x)$ is dirac function at point $x$, hence the multiply of $\delta(z-I(x)$ and $f(z)$ will return a narrow distribution around the pixel $x$.

Since $\sum_1^\infty b_n$ diverges ( $\sum_1^\infty \frac{1}{n}$ diverges by p-series, $p=1$), $\sum_1^\infty a_n$ diverges. So by the Limit Comparison Test, $\sum_1^\infty \frac{n}{n^2 + 4}$  diverges. Right? Also, this problem was an exercise in the Ratio/Root Test section. Both tests, however seem to fail.

But this doesn't answer the question. To answer the question we have to prove that ""there does not exist a set of polynomials whose common zero set is U(n)"". For odd n I have an idea: since the real dimension of U(n) is $n^2$, when n is odd it cannot be a complex variety whose real dimension should always be even(am I right here?). But what if n is even? Any hints will be appreciated. ============ I think I've got the idea of @orangeskid answer. Let me edit the post and make it more detailed, so that others can understand. First let's state 3 lemmas: Lemma 1 . Given an analytic function $f$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$, and suppose $W$ is a $n$ (real) dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that $\mathbb{C}^n\cong W+iW$, if $\left.f\right |_W\equiv 0$, then $f\equiv 0$. Lemma 2 . The Lie algebra $W=u(n)\subset \mathbb{C}^{n^2}$ of the Lie group $U(n)\subset GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ has a real dimension of $n^2$, and has the property that $\mathbb{C}^{n^2}\cong W+iW$. Lemma 3 . Given an analytic function $g: GL(n,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $U(n)$, the exponential map exp transplants it to an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that vanishes on $u(n)$. Once we have the 3 lemmas, it's easy: Suppose $g: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a polynomial vanishing on $U(n)$. Based on Lemma 3 we get an analytic function $f=g\circ \exp: \mathbb{C}^{n^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishing on $u(n)$, so according to Lemma 1 and 2 we have $f\equiv 0$, which implies $g\equiv0$ on $\exp(\mathbb{C}^{n^2})=GL(n,\mathbb{C})$. Q.E.D. So we need only to prove the lemmas. Proof of Lemma 1 : Identifying $\mathbb{C}^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, choose an orthonormal basis $\{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \}$ of $W$. Then $\{e_1, \operatorname{J}(e_1), \dots, e_n, \operatorname{J}(e_n)\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, where $\operatorname{J}$ is the almost complex structure of $\mathbb{C}^n$. Do a coordinate transformation so that these basis become the (real)coordinate basis of the coordinate $\{z_1, \dots, z_n\}=\{x^1+iy^1, \dots, x^n+iy^n\}$ and the conclusion reduces to the following one: If the analytic function $f: \mathbb{C}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ vanishes on the real coordinates, that is, $f(x^1, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0$, then $f(z_1, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. $\forall x^2, \dots, x^n$, let $g(z)=f(z, x^2, \dots, x^n)$, $g$ is analytic and $g(x)=f(x, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall x\in \mathbb{R}$. So $g\equiv 0$, that is, $f(z_1, x^2, \dots, x^n)\equiv 0, \forall z_1\in\mathbb{C}, x^i\in\mathbb{R}, i=2, \dots, n$. Continue the process we'll get $f(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)\equiv 0$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 2 : $u(n)$ is the group of all n × n skew-Hermitian matrices, having a real dimension of $n^2$. For any n × n complex matrix A, Write A as $$A=\frac{A-A^*}{2} + i\cdot(-i)\frac{A+A^*}{2}$$. Q.E.D. Proof of Lemma 3 : This is trivial since exp is analytic. Q.E.D.",['algebraic-geometry']

934293,Geometry question pertaining to $4$ points in the plane where $90$ degree projectors are on each point and we must illuminate the whole plane.,"Suppose we have $4$ points that can be positioned anywhere in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Now imagine each point has $90$ degree projectors coming out of them and you can rotate these projectors any way you would like. How can one prove that no matter where the four points are you can rotate the projectors so that the whole plane will be illuminated entirely? I would like to elaborate on illuminate. You see, if you can imagine to lines shooting out of the points where they form $90$ degree angles then the space contained inbetween the lines can be thought of as being illuminated. And so obviously if the points are positioned such that they look to be corners of a square, we can just rotate the projectors so that they look to be the sides of a square. And so then extending the projectors off to infinity we can illuminate the whole plane. This is just one case of course. I was not sure how to prove it no matter where the points are. My thought was wherever the points are try to draw an $xy$ axis such that each point is in a quadrant. Then one can just proceed to make the projectors so that they form a square like figure again. Its an interesting problem. Heres a bonus question. Suppose there are $n$ projectors located at $n$ points where each projector illuminates $\displaystyle\frac{360}{n}$ degrees. Then one can rotate them until the whole plane is illuminated.","['geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

Question Consider the set of all skew-symmetric $M_{2\times 2}$ matrices, call it $W$ . A matrix $A$ is an element of this set provided that $-A = A^{t}$ . Find a basis for $W$ , what is the dimension of $W$ ? Attempted Answer If we consider $$A = \begin{pmatrix}
a &b \\ 
 c&d 
\end{pmatrix}$$ Then $$A^{t} = \begin{pmatrix} a & c \\ b & d\end{pmatrix}.$$ So, for a matrix to be in our subspace, we would have $$\begin{pmatrix}-a & -b \\ -c & -d\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}a & c \\ b & d\end{pmatrix}$$ This implies that $-a = a$ and $-d = d$ , so $a$ and $d$ are $0$ and that $b = -c$ . Therefore the resulting set of matrices will look like $$\begin{pmatrix}0 & -c\\c & 0\end{pmatrix}.$$ This is where I run into trouble. I'm not sure if the dimension of this subspace is $1$ or $2$ . If I factor the $c$ out, then I have the matrix $$
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix},
$$ and by taking any scalar multiple of this matrix, I can create any matrix in the subspace of $2\times 2$ skew-symmetric matrices. It's also linearly independent so it should be a basis. My confusion arises in that I could also decompose the matrix further into the two matrices $$\begin{pmatrix}0 & -c \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}
\quad \text{and} \quad 
\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\c & 0\end{pmatrix}$$ These are both linearly independent vectors and span the subspace, so it's a basis, and I was wondering if that means the dimension of the subspace should be $2$ .

$$(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_k+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{-k}) (\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}b_k+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}b_{-k})$$ $$=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{n-k}b_k +\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{n-k}b_{-k-1}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{-n+k-1}b_{k}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{-n+k-1}b_{-k},$$ is equal to $\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{n-k}b_k$. The people who regarded this question of mine as a duplicate to that were enough to have this question closed for a while, therefore, I suppose that it may well be trivial that the equality $(\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}a_n)(\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_n)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{n-k}b_k$ derives from the equality, known by me, $(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n)(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_n)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{n-k}b_k$.

I first use the definition of conditional probability. $$P(X_i=x_i\mid X_r=j)= \frac{P(X_i=x_i \cap X_r=j)}{P(X_r=j)}$$ Now, for the numerator, I use the multinomial distribution, which gives $$P(X_i=x_i \cap X_r=j) = \frac{n!}{x_i! j!} p_i^{x_i} p_r^j$$ For the denominator, I write $$P(X_r=j) =\frac{n!}{j!

So here's my problem $y''\:-\:4y'\:+\:2y\:=\:2x^2$ and here's my step to answer I know that to solve this 2nd-order inhomogeneous differential equation the general solution is $y\:=\:y_c\:+\:y_p$ where $y_c$ is the general solution of the homogeneous equation. And $y_p$ is a particular solution First, I find for $y_c$ through $y''\:-\:4y'\:+\:2y\:=\:0$ since it's in the form of different roots of the auxiliary equation, i found that $m_1\:=\:2+\sqrt{2}$ and $m_2\:=\:2-\sqrt{2}$ , so the general solution of the homogeneous equation is $y_c=c_1e^{\left(2+\sqrt{2}\right)x}+c_2e^{\left(2-\sqrt{2}\right)x}$ Second, since it's a polynomial problem so i find for $y_p$ through $y_p=Ax^2+Bx+C$ first and second derivative of $y_p$ are $y'_p=2Ax\:+\:B\:\:\:\:\:\:\:and\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:y""_p=2A$ so now i have to find the undetermined coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$. I find these coefficients through substitute $y_p$ into $y$, $y'_p$ into $y'$, and $y''_p$ into $y""$, thus $y''\:-\:4y'\:+\:2y\:=\:\left(2A\right)x^2+\left(2B-8A\right)x\:+\:\left(2A-4B+2C\right)=2x^2$ So, $A\:=\:\frac{1}{2}\:,\:B\:=\:0,\:C\:=\:\frac{1}{2}$ and then substitute this into $y_p$, I find the particular solution which is $y_p=\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2+1\right)$ and finally I find the general solution in the form of $y\:=\:c_1e^{\left(2+\sqrt{2}\right)x}+c_2e^{\left(2-\sqrt{2}\right)x}+\frac{1}{2}\left(x^2+1\right)$ This is my answer, am I correct or not?
