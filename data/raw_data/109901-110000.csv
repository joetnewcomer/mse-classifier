1584321,Importance of Locally Compact Hausdorff Spaces,"I mostly deal with measure and probability theory and quite often, whenever I look up something on wikipedia, I see the mathematical objects defined on a locally compact Hausdorff space . I have very little background in topology and while I do understand the definition, why do I see this space so often is something that you can't simply see from the definition itself. My guess is that it is in some sense a generalisation of the spaces we deal with (say $\mathbb R^n$), which is general enough to include a variety of spaces, but restricted enough to keep the nice properties we want. Similar to, say, formulating results in analysis in a metric space (even if we're mostly interested in $\mathbb R^n$ or even $\mathbb R$), or probability results formulated in $\sigma$-finite spaces (even though we really have a finite space). Therefore: is the guess above correct? If so, what are some of the nice properties? Is there a particular connection to probability theory? I would consider answering the first question sufficient, but would very much welcome a context along the lines of the second and third question. Thank you.","['general-topology', 'compactness', 'probability-theory']"
1584338,Definition of the category of group representations,"One usually considers the category of complex linear group representations for a fixed group $G$ . It is defined as the category whose objects are group morphisms $G \rightarrow GL(V)$ where $V$ is a complex vector space and whose morphisms are $G$-equivariant linear maps (equivalently, it is the category of functors $Vect_\mathbb{C}^G$). My question is: can we consider a category of group representations where the group is allowed to change? I would be tempted to define it as follows. Objects would be triples $(V, G, \pi: G \rightarrow GL(V))$ and morphisms 
$\big(V, G, \pi: G \rightarrow GL(V)\big) \xrightarrow{\Phi} \big(V', G', \pi': G' \rightarrow GL(V')\big)$ would be pairs $\Phi:=(\phi, \alpha)$ where $\phi$ is a linear map from $V$ to $V'$ and $\alpha$ is a group morphism from $G$ to $G'$ such that the following property is satisfied:
$$\forall g \in G, \pi'(\alpha(g)) \circ \phi= \phi \circ \pi(g)$$ Does this definition make sense? If yes, why is this category never considered?","['category-theory', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory']"

1584351,"Show that if $\sum_n |a_n|$ converges, then $\sum_n a_n^2$ converges","Show that if $\sum_n |a_n|$ converges, then $\sum_n a_n^2$ converges
  whenever all $a_n$ are in $\mathbb{R}$. Lemma: I have already proved that if $\sum_n a_n$ and $\sum_n b_n$ converge absolutely, then $\sum_{n,m} a_n b_m$ converges absolutely. Let's take $b_n:=a_n$ for all $n$. From the above lemma we know that $\sum_{n,m} a_n a_m$ converges absolutely. Since $\sum_n a_n^2 \le \sum_{n,m} |a_n a_m|$, by comparison we get that $\sum_n a_n^2$ is convergent. Now I have two questions: 1) Is the above derivation correct? 2) Is it possible to deduce this without refering to the Lemma?","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
1584352,Group cohomology or classical approach for class field theory?,"First of all, I don't think this is a duplicate, because the related questions I found were mainly about history of group cohomology in number theory and there was no one asking about the classical approach versus the cohomological approach. If you find one, post it below and I'll consider deleting this one. Thanks. I'm an $2$nd year undergraduate student currently studying algebraic number theory by Neukirch's book and I think that I covered most of the things people usually consider the basics, which is the study of algebraic number fields, integrality, the ideal class group, ramification of prime ideals and the theory of $p$-adic numbers and valuations in general. It feels like the next step is (and I think that I have more or less appropriate background) to dive in class field theory. Doing a little search, I found that class field theory (both local and global) can be done in a variety of ways, for example using group cohomology. I don't know anything about group cohomology, but I think that Neukirch's approach does not use group cohomology, even though he talks about groups $H^{0}(G(L/K),A_{L})$, which I believe is notation that shows up in group cohomology. About this, I have some questions: In the aspect of difficulty, which approach should I take? Neukirch vs. Group cohomology (for example in Milne's online notes for CFT) If group cohomology was the answer for the previous one, then should I learn some category theory before group cohomology or it is not that related? Are the two approaches actually distinct or just different in language? For example, is the the approach via group cohomology just identifying number-theoretical objects with ""cohomological"" objects and then applying theorems? Is it worthy to try and do both at the same time and get a wide view on the subject? EDIT : I forgot that Neukirch has a book about class field theory only. I'm actually using his Algebraic Number Theory.","['number-theory', 'class-field-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

1584374,Counterexample of polynomials in infinite dimensional Banach spaces,"I'm trying to prove exercise I.3.B in Mujica's ""Complex analysis in Banach spaces"". DEFINITIONS: A map $P$ is an m-homogeneous polynomial from $E$ to $F$ if there is a m-linear map $A$ from $E^m$ to $F$ such that $P(x)=A(x, \dots, x)$ . $P$ is a polynomial of degree at most $m$ if $P = P_0 + \dots + P_m$ where each $P_j$ is an j-homogeneous polynomial. I have to find a function $f: E \to \mathbb{K}$ (where $E$ is infinite dimensional) such that $f(a + \lambda b)$ is a polynomial in $\lambda$ for all $a,b \in E$ but $f$ is not a polynomial. $f$ clearly has to be discontinuous because there is a theorem implying that $f$ would be a polynomial in the continuous case. I thought about considering something like (where $\theta$ stands for the step function): $$f(a+\lambda b) = \theta (\| b\| -1) (a_1 + \lambda b_1)$$ But I don't know how to prove that $f$ wouldn't be a polynomial or even how to apply it to an arbitrary $x \in E$ . I also know that the restriction of $f$ to any finite dimensional subspace of $E$ is indeed a polynomial and that there is a sequence of homogeneous polynomials $P_k$ such that $f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} P_k(x)$ where for each $x \in E$ $P_k(x)=0$ for all but finitely many indices.

The most straightforward approach to define one is to use linearization, but I am not sure if this is a good idea as the accuracy of linearization will probably have an decisive impact on the region of absolute stability.","['stability-in-odes', 'numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'soft-question']"
1584409,Having trouble justifying order of integral and sum,"I'm trying to prove that $\mu$ is a measure on $\mathcal{M}$, where $\mu(E) = \int_{E}f$, $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty]$ is a Lebesgue measurable funciton, and $\mathcal{M}$ consists of all the Lebesgue measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. Right now, I'm trying to show countable additivity: $\mu(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}) = \cup_{k=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_{k})$, where the $E_{k}$ are disjoint. So far, I have that $\mu(\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}) = \int_{\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}}f = \int f 1_{\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}}$ (where $1_{\cup_{k=1}^{\infty}E_{k}}$ is an indicator function) $= \int \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}f 1_{E_{k}}$, and on the next step, I need to switch the $\int$ and the $\sum$. I would like to use Monotone Convergence Theorem to get the job done, but $f 1_{E_{k}}$, while nonnegative, is not necessarily increasing (or is it?).

1584432,Why does this proof fail?,"I'm reading some notes on topology, and the notes' author is trying to raise motivation to consider compactness by providing a theorem whose proof is built intentionally wrong, but I don't agree with the reason he gives why the proof fails. Here's the theorem, Every sequence $0<a_n<1$ has a subsequence $a_{n_k}$ with $0<\lim a_{n_k}<1$ and here's the (wrong) proof: Let's look at  a collection of intervals of the form $$(a_n- \frac{1}{2n} ,a_n+ \frac{1}{2n})$$ with n=1,2... Each of these intervals has length,  1/n, and since $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} 1/n =\infty$ and the length of the interval (0,1) is 1, there must be a point l in (0,1) which is covered by infinite intervals, say $(a_{n_k}-\frac{1}{2n_k},a_{n_k}+\frac{1}{2{n_k}} )$ , therefore
$$\lim a_{n_k}=l\in(0,1)$$
The author says the proof is wrong because one can not always pick a finite subcover from an infinite cover (hence because the interval $(0,1)$ it's not compact), but I claim the proof breaks down even before that. Why? Because there isn't always a point in $(0,1)$ which is covered by infinite intervals, and an example of a collection of intervals for which there isn't a point $l$ in $(0,1)$ which is covered by infinite intervals is obtained when we substitute $a_n$ for $\frac{1}{2n}$, that is, the collection $\{(0,1/n), n\in \mathbb{N}\}$. So my question is, where does the proof actually fail? And, if the author was right, could you give a better explanation than his?

1584450,Understanding random variables,"I am just getting into probability theory, and don't quite understand the concept of random variables. It is presented to me as a transformation, it takes input from a background space of ""events"" and gives output in a space of, say, real numbers. This makes intuitive sense, as we are simply ""labeling"" events in some way. However, shortly after this introduction, the book ignores everything about the definition it just gave, and starts talking solely about ""distributions"" of random variables, and ""distributions of transformations"" of random variables. Almost every exercise now begins with ""let $X$ be a blablably distributed random variable"" as well ... What does it, intuitively, mean to have some distribution, and why is that more important than knowing the explicit definition of $X$ (say, $X(x) = |x|$, or something)? I understand that knowing the distribution of $X$ is useful, ... but don't we want to go in the other direction instead?

$$0 \to I_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3) \to \mathcal O_{\mathbb P^3}(3) \to \mathcal O_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3) \to 0,$$

If cubic curves intersect, then $h^0(\mathcal O_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3)) < 20$, so indeed $h^0(I_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3)) > 0$ and that's all. On the contrary, if they do not intersect, $h^0(\mathcal O_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3)) = 20$, but there still may be $h^0(I_{C_1 \cup C_2}(3))$.

1584524,All the ternary n-words with an even sum of digits and a zero.,"I'm trying to find a recursive formula for all the ternary (using ${0,1,2}$) sequences of length $n$ which contain at least one zero, and have an even sum of digits. My attempt so far is added below. I think the idea is right, but the recurrence relation I get fails when setting in numbers (and it's not always an integer..). any ideas? Denote with $f\left(n\right)$ the number of legal sequences as in the question, $\bar{f}\left(n\right)$ as the number of sequences with at least one 0 with an odd number of digits, and as $g\left(n\right)$ the number of sequences with an even sum of digits and with no zeroes. For any sequence, the sum of digits would be even if and only if there is an even number of 1s, therefore any legal sequence of length $n$ can be achieved in a unique way out of the following: • Starting from a sequence where the digits are even and there is no zero, append zero at the end. There are $g\left(n-1\right)$ such sequences. • Starting from a legal sequence of length $n-1$, append 0 or 2 at the end, adding $2f\left(n-1\right)$ sequences. • Starting from a sequence with a zero where the sum of digits is odd, append 1 at the end, adding $\bar{f}\left(n-1\right)$ sequences. These gives us that $$f\left(n\right)=2f\left(n-1\right)+\bar{f}\left(n-1\right)+g\left(n-1\right)$$ Considering $g\left(n\right)$ first, we are interested in strings of length n from $\left\{ 1,2\right\} $ with an even number of 1s. There's a simple bijection to the set of strings of length $n$ with an odd number of 1s by “flipping” the first value, and as these sets include all possibilities with no overlap, it follows that $g\left(n\right)=2^{n-1}$. Next looking at $\bar{f}\left(n-1\right)$. We can use the fact that the sequences with a zero where the sum of digits is odd and the sequences with a zero where the sum of digits is even are exactly a disjoint union of all the sequences with a zero. As there are $n\cdot3^{n-1}$ such sequences (we first choose one location to be 0, and fill the rest normally), we get that $\bar{f}\left(n\right)+f\left(n\right)=n\cdot3^{n-1}$, or $\bar{f}\left(n\right)=n\cdot3^{n-1}-f\left(n\right)$ Putting this all together we get that $$f\left(n\right)=2f\left(n-1\right)+\left(n-1\right)\cdot3^{n-2}-f\left(n-1\right)+2^{n-2}

1584667,Compact subset in colimit of spaces,"I found at the beginning of tom Dieck's Book the following (non proved) result Suppose $X$ is the colimit of the sequence $$ X_1 \subset X_2 \subset X_3 \subset \cdots $$ Suppose points in $X_i$ are closed. Then each compact subset $K$ of $X$ is contained in some $X_k$ Now I really don't know how to prove this fact. The idea would be to find a suitable open cover to it and after taking a finite sub cover trying to claim that $K$ lies in one of the $X_k$. I'm able to do this reasoning in some more specific cases, where I've more control on how open subsets looks like, but in this full generality I don't see which open cover I can take. My Attempt: The only idea or approach I'm able to cook up so far is to try use some kind of sequence of points $x_n \in K\cap X_n \setminus X_{n-1}$ which can be assumed to exist by absurd. Being $K$ compact, there must be an accumulation point $k\in K$. Clearly $k \in X_k$ (little abuse of notation here) and for every neighbourhood of $k$, there is a tail of this sequence entirely contained in it. Now everything seems to boil down to find the right nbhd to find the counterexample. It seems doable, but I don't have any idea on how to choose it, because the only open I have for sure are complements of points, but they seems a little bit coarse for what I want to do. As a side note, May claims at page $67$ of his ""Concise Course (revised)"" that this result holds for any based spaces. The proof seems to use the above result without T1 assumption.

1584708,The cardinality of Indra's net?,"This question has been asked before, but the title of the post was so general that it received no sufficient answer. What is the cardinality of the set of jewels and reflected jewels in Indra's Net? For those who don't know, Indra's Net is a poetic image used in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology to represent the universe. Imagine a grid-like net with a countably infinite amount of intersections and at each intersection there is a jewel. Now, on the surface of each jewel there are reflected images of every other jewel in the net. And since each of these reflected jewels is a copy of the actual jewels, they also have an infinite amount of reflected jewels within them. And within that second level of infinite reflected jewels, each of them also have infinite reflections... and so on, and so on, forever. Basically, Indra's Net is like the scenario of two ideal mirrors facing each other, only the number of mirrors is countably infinite. I've been trying to picture this with the number line. The integers could represent the original jewels, and the non-integer rational numbers could represent the first level of reflected jewels. Just pair each integer n with every rational number greater than n but smaller than n+1. But then, each non-integer rational number would then have to be paired with its own distinct countably infinite group of numbers to represent the second level of reflection, and then every number representing that next level of reflection would in turn need its own distinct countably infinite group of numbers to be paired with, and so on, and so on. Are there enough real numbers for this? The continuum always surprises me. Thank you. EDIT: Reading the answers to the first version of this question made me realize how I underestimated the power of the old ""1,2,3..."". Now, I have a similar question to my previous one, but I want to change the image of Indra's Net a bit. Imagine the standard image mentioned above, but then project the starting position infinitely ""deep down"" the levels of reflection so that not only do you see the standard Indra's Net before you, but as you look ""outwards"" you realize that your position is just one of infinitely many reflections within a larger meta-reflection, which itself is just a one reflection within an even larger meta-meta-reflection, and so on and so on, there being no ""actual"" jewels to begin with. You can ""zoom-in"" and ""zoom-out"" forever in both directions. Is the cardinality of reflected jewels in this altered Indra's Net also the same as the set of integers?

1584799,How many ways to arrange 15 people around 3 circular tables seating 5 people each,"I've seen questions where it will have you arrange $N$ people at $2$ tables with $N\over 2$ people sitting at them. The answer is usually 
$$\binom{N} {\frac{N}{2}} \cdot \left(\frac{N}{2} - 1\right)! \cdot \left(\frac{N}{2} - 1\right)!$$ 
Because with two tables having half the total number of people at each, we know what people are at both tables just by knowing the people at $1$, then we just multiply by all possible arrangements at each. In a situation where by knowing one tables people we still do not know the others ($3$ tables or more) do we have to multiply by another $\binom{N}{K}$? For example with $15$ people at $3$ different tables each seating $5$ people, is the number of combinations of seating equal to: $$\binom{15}{5} \binom{10}{5}(4!)^3$$ And could we take this answer and divide by 3! to eliminate all situations where all arrangements are the same but just at different tables?","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

$$0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0...$$ Each term denotes the number of times the corresponding natural number, starting from $0$, was hit by subsequent steps of sieving. After we sieve the number $2$, the sequence becomes: $$1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1...$$
We can easily see a pattern here: it's just $1, 0$ repeated ad infinitum.
The pattern's length is $2$. After we sieve the number $3$, the sequence becomes:
$$2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0...$$ It's clear that we just repeat $2,0,1,1,1,0$, a pattern whose length is $6$. So the pattern constantly expands until we get to the number $6$.
Here are the patterns for $5$ and $6$ respectively (I've omitted commas for tighter spacing): $401121202120301220203110311120302111301130202210302120212110$

Numerical evidence suggests that the pattern only ever expands after sieving prime powers - if $n = p^{e}$, the pattern's length for $n$ is the pattern's length for $n-1$ multiplied by $e$. So far I've validated this up to $18$. Can this conjecture be proven? Most importantly, is there a way to conceive this phenomenon intuitively? I've looked up the sequence of consecutive pattern lengths (starting from 2) and from what I can see it's got something to do with least common multiples.","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers', 'sieve-theory']"

We have 5 'chances' for 1 goal, 2 goals, 3, 4, and 5 goals.
Each 'chance' has to be lower from previous (chance for 2 goals < chance for 1 goal in a match). And we need to fit in 100% with all 5 values. First, I ask my user to provide a chance for 'one goal'.
I did some calculations and it seems, that the 'one goal' chance has to be in a range 22-90, because:
if we get 21, our next value must be lower so: 20, 19, 18, 17
which gives: 21+20+19+18+17 = 95 which is not 100% (we need 100% for all goals)
So we need to start from 18 and end on 22, cause these are first numbers which sum gives 100. Same situation is for end of the range. It must be maximum 90. If we pick 90 for first goal, we can only pick 4, 3, 2, 1, cause it will give 100. If we would pick 91, we go out of range (100).

1584995,Justifying the Normal Approx to the Binomial Distribution through MGFs,"Would absolutely love if someone could help me with this question, in a step by step way to help those who are uninitiated to Statistics and Mathematics. So, I am trying to ""prove/justify"" through MGFs how as n(the sample size) increases and goes to infinity, a standardized binomial distribution converges to the Standard Normal Distribution. So in the beginning we have $X_n $~$ Bin(n,p)$ then we standardize this $R.V.$ by subtracting the mean $E(X_n)=np$ and dividing by the $SD$ which is $np(1-p)$. After doing this, we get a new $R.V.$ with $mean=1$ and $variance=SD=1$. It is the distribution of this standardized quantity that converges to a fixed distribution, correct? Namely the Standard Normal Distribution. Let's call the standardized version of $X_n$, $Z_n$. I think what we need to do is to find the MGF of $Z_n$ and show that this MGF becomes the Standard Normal Distribution's MGF as the sample size $(n)$ heads toward infinity. Now $Z_n$ is a function of $X_n$ which we know the MGF of which is $(1-p+pe^t)^n$. Now I know that $Z_n$ is a linear transform and that we should be able to use this to simply the MGF but I don't understand how the course notes do it, mostly because they skip a lot of steps and it is difficult to follow. There is also a Taylor Series Expansion for the exponential that I am confused about although I do understand the concept of the series expansion. Help would be greatly appreciated!

1585034,What Yoneda tells us about algebraic geometry,"I am currently learning about relative algebraic geometry, and I'm just trying to walk myself through some of the foundations and motivating examples before moving on to the proper stuff (symmetric monoidal categories et al.), starting with the category $\mathsf{Comm}_k$ of commutative $k$-algebras.
Below is my attempt at explaining the setup. Define $\mathsf{Aff}_k=\mathsf{Comm}_k^{\textrm{op}}$, the category of affine schemes over $k$ ; Define $\mathsf{Sp}_k=\mathsf{PShv}(\mathsf{Aff}_k)=\mathsf{Fun}(\mathsf{Aff}_k^{\textrm{op}},\mathsf{Set})$, the category of $k$-spaces ; Yoneda's lemma tells us that,for $A\in\mathsf{Aff}_k^{\textrm{op}}$ and $F\in\mathsf{Sp}_k$, $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{Sp}_k}(Y_A,F)\cong F(A)$, where the isomorphism is given by the canonical restriction; the functor $Y_A$ is fully faithful; Define $\mathrm{Spec}=Y\colon\mathsf{Aff}_k\to\mathsf{Sp}_k$, the spectrum functor , as the Yoneda functor; Note that $\mathsf{Aff}_k$ is equivalent to the essential image of the Yoneda embedding (since $\mathrm{Spec}$ is fully faithful (by the above) and essentially surjective onto its essential image). First of all, it'd be nice to know if all of the above is free of mistakes and the correct sort of approach, and if so (or even if not, I guess), here are my questions: For the first fact that Yoneda's lemma tells us in the above, what exactly does the 'canonical restriction' look like in this scenario? What does the first fact actually tell us about this whole setup? I've used the second fact, which is sort of a corollary of Yoneda's lemma, from what I can tell, but don't see what the first fact tells us. Why do we care about the last bit, that $\mathsf{Aff}_k$ is equivalent to the essential image of the Yoneda embedding? I know that some places define $\mathsf{Aff}_k$ to be this essential image, and others don't... If we work with a finitely-generated $k$-algebra $A$ then we can write 
$$A=\frac{k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1,\ldots,f_m)}$$
and then we have the bijection of sets (if the category is small? see below) $$\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\longleftrightarrow\{y\in B^n\mid f_1(y)=\ldots=f_m(y)=0\}$$
since a morphism is given by choosing a place to send the $x_i$, but since zero must be preserved, these images must satisfy the $f_i$.
But are we working with small categories, and should we just be working with finitely-generated commutative $k$-algebras, or is this nice fact just a useful way of looking at the 'nice' objects of $\mathsf{Comm}_k$?

Let $p(z) = z^ 3 - 3\Lambda^ 2 z$ where $\Lambda$ could be any number.  If you want $\Lambda = 1$ and $p(z) = z^ 3 - 3z$.  Then $$ \int_0^{\sqrt{3}\Lambda} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{p(z)}} = \int_0^{\sqrt{3}\Lambda} \frac{dz}{\sqrt{z(z - \sqrt{3}\Lambda\,)(z+\sqrt{3}\Lambda\,)}} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \frac{\Gamma(\frac{3}{4})}{\Gamma(\frac{9}{4})} (\sqrt{3}\Lambda)^{5/2}$$ The physics paper at least tell us $\int \propto \Lambda^{5/2}$ so we know the growth rate. It could be that $\Lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ is even simpler than $\Lambda = 1$. $$  \int_0^1 \frac{dz}{\sqrt{z(z - 1\,)(z+1\,)}} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \frac{\Gamma(\frac{3}{4})}{\Gamma(\frac{9}{4})}$$ This should be connected to the Riemann surface $y^ 2 = z(z^2 -1)$.

If it's known $T(D^o) \subseteq T(D)^o$, why is it true that $\partial T(D) \subseteq T(\partial D)$? I'm confused b/c we know LHS=$T(D)\cap (T(D)^o)^c$, which is  $\subseteq T(D) \cap T(D^o)^c$ by the assumption. RHS=$T(D\cap (D^o)^c)$, which we only know is $\subseteq T(D) \cap T((D^o)^c)$, since we don't know T is 1-to-1. Here is more background for my question.  We consider $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ open, $T:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}^n$, $T \in C'$ in $\Omega$.  Furthermore, its Jacobian $J_T \neq 0$ on $\Omega$.  We are trying to show, if $D \subseteq \Omega$ is compact and $\partial D$ has no volume, then $\partial T(D)$ has no volume either.

If dim$D=k$ constant, then the distribution is regular and the dimension of the submanifolds are all the same. In this case we have Frobenius theorem, stating that the distribution is integrable if and only if it is involutive ($X,Y\in D\Rightarrow [X,Y]\in D$). An equivalent conditions (Frobenius condition) is phrased in terms of $n-k$ independent differential forms $\omega_i\in\Omega^1(M)$  with $1\leq i \leq n-k$ that vanish on $D$, i.e. $\langle\omega_i,X\rangle=0 \;\forall i\forall X\in D$. So $D$ is integrable if and only if there are $1$-forms $\{\alpha^i_j\}_{i,j=1}^{n-k}$ such that
\begin{equation}
d\omega_i=\sum_j \alpha^j_i\wedge\omega_j
\end{equation}
and for co-dimension one foliations the condition reduces to $d\omega\wedge \omega=0$. Question: Is there a similar condition for singular, but nevertheless integrable distributions? For the dimensions to work out there would then have to be a set of $n-k$ one forms, where $k=\min_{x\in M}\dim D_x$, that are not linearly independent. Is anyone aware of a reference or a conditon similar to one above?","['integrable-systems', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology', 'exterior-algebra']"
1585108,Exercise in Engelking's book regarding a disconnected space.,"This is related to 6.3.24 in Engelking's Topology book. The Hilbert space $H$ is the set of sequences $(x_i) \in \mathbb R ^\omega$ such that $\|x\|=\sum _{i=1} ^\infty x_i ^2<\infty$, with metric $d(x,y)=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1} ^\infty (x_i-y_i)^2}$. Let $X$ be the subspace of $H$ consisting of the sequences of rationals. Observe that by assigning a point $(x_i)\in X$ with the same point in $\mathbb Q ^\omega$ one defines a continuous mapping and deduce that there is a one-to-one continuous mapping $f:X\to C$ of $X$ into the Cantor set $C$ such that $f(x_0)=0$. By the observation we may assume $X$ is second countable and zero dimensional. Let $x_0\in X$. Let $\{U_i:i\in\omega\}$ be a clopen base for $X$. Let $A=\{i\in\omega:x_0\in U_i\}$ and $B=\omega\setminus A$. For each $x\in X$ let $$f(x)(i)=\begin{cases} 0 &\mbox{if } (i\in A \wedge x\in U_i) \vee (i\in B \wedge x\in X\setminus U_i) \\ 
1 & \mbox{else} \end{cases}.$$ Then $f:X\to 2^\omega$ by $f(x)=(f(x)(i))$ is well-defined, one-to-one, continuous, and $f(x_0)=0$. Define a mapping $g:X\to [0,1]^2$ by letting $g(x)= \big(  \frac{f(x)}{\max (1,\|x\|)},\frac{\|x\|}{1+\|x\|} \big)$. Show that the space $X_1=g[X]\cup \{(0,1/2)\}$ is hereditarily disconnected but not totally disconnected. Hint: Note that there is a one-to-one continuous mapping of $g[C]$ onto $f[X]$, and that if $A\subseteq X$ is clopen and $\{\|x\|:x\in A\}$ is bounded then $A=\varnothing$. I assume that $g[C]$ should be $g[X]$. $X_1$ is hereditarily disconnected: For $(r,s)\in g[X]$ let $$h(r,s)=\begin{cases} r &\mbox{if } s\leq 1/2 \\ 
{\frac{rs}{1-s}} & \mbox{else} \end{cases}.$$ It is easy to show that $h$ is a continuous one-to-one mapping of $g[X]$ onto $f[X]$. As $f[X]$ is hereditarily disconnected, so is $g[X]$. Also, in creating this mapping I realized we can think of $g[X]$ as a subset of $C\times [0,1]$, squeezed at the top to the point $(0,1)$. It is now clear that no connected subset of $X_1$ meets $\{(0,1/2)\}$ and $g[X]$, as $(0,0)$ is the only point of $g[X]$ along the $y$-axis. $X_1$ is not totally disconnected: Suppose $A$ is clopen in $X_1$ containing $(0,1/2)$, missing $(0,0)$. There exist $\epsilon,\delta>0$ such that $\big(B_\epsilon (0)\times B_\delta (1/2)\big)\cap X_1\subseteq A$. There exists $r\in (0,\epsilon)$ such that $[0,r]\cap C$ is clopen in $C$. Then I BELIEVE $$\big([0,r]\times [0,1/2]\big)\cap g[X]\setminus A$$ is  clopen in $g[X]$. It is also nonempty as it contains $(0,0)$. Its preimage under $g$ is nonempty and clopen in $X$, and has bounded norm.  This contradicts the claim in the 2nd part of the hint, which is provable via the standard argument that $X$ (the Erdos space) is not zero dimensional. $\\$ $\\$ NOTE1: I believe I have solved this problem now, but I would of course appreciate any feedback/verification. Also, if anyone is interested I could add some details to my solution. NOTE2: For the purpose of giving a space which is hereditarily disconnected but not totally disconnected, I think we could have defined $g$ simply by $g(x)=(f(x),\|x\|)$, and let $X_1=g[X]\cup \{(0,r)\}$ for any $r\in (0,\infty)$. The definition above is more complicated in order to achieve the squeezing, so that adding $(0,1)$ to the space actually makes it connected (by the 2nd part of the hint). That is the subject of another part of the exercise.","['reference-request', 'general-topology', 'cantor-set', 'connectedness']"

Suppose that X is an $\alpha$-stable non-degenerate Levy process in $\mathbb{R}$ with characteristic exponent $\psi$. Show that $t \psi(r) = \psi(t^{1/\alpha} r)$ for $t>0, r \in \mathbb{R}$. Show that $\psi(r) = c r^\alpha$ for some complex constant $c$ for $r \in \mathbb{R}_+$. Suppose $X$ and $-X$ have the same probability law, i.e. $\psi(r) = \psi(-r)$ for all $r$.

My current work: Recall that non-degenerate means that $X_t \neq 0$ almost surely for all $t$. Also, recall that the characteristic exponent of a Levy process is given by the Levy-Khintchine formula:
  $$ \psi(r) = ir \cdot b - \frac12 r \cdot v r + \int_{\mathbb{B}} \lambda(dx)(e^{ir \cdot x} - 1 - ir \cdot x) + \int_{\mathbb{B}^c}\lambda(dx) (e^{ir \cdot x} - 1),$$ for $r \in \mathbb{R}^d$, $b$ is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $v = c c^T$ (where $c$ is a $d \times d'$ matrix), $\mathbb{B}$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{B}^c$ is the complement in $\mathbb{B}$ of the ball of radius $\varepsilon$.

  $$ t \psi(r) = t \left[ ir \cdot b - \frac12 r \cdot v r + \int_{\mathbb{B}} \lambda(dx)(e^{ir \cdot x} - 1 - ir \cdot x) + \int_{\mathbb{B}^c}\lambda(dx) (e^{ir \cdot x} - 1) \right]$$

Right now I can do that in $O(\frac{n^n}{n!})$ , but maybe there is a $O(n \log{n})$ algorithm. I would like to reformulate the problem to another domain (for example Chinese remainder theorem, prime number factorization, Galois Field, finding the GCD), and solve it like this, or prove brute force is the the best algorithm. Warning: I'm not good at math, so the following is probably ridiculous, but maybe somebody can help to improve my question and use the right tags. So I came up with a (integer only) formula that has multiple solutions, and one unknown, $x$ . I'm trying to find the smallest $x$ quickly. There are a number of known, randomly distributed, positive integers $h_n$ , in the range [0 .. 65536). The size $s$ is quite small, let's say 16 (the higher the better). The right hand side of the equation is a constant. $$
\sum_{n=1}^{s} {s ^ {(\lfloor\frac{h_n x}{65536}\rfloor \bmod s)}}
=
\sum_{n=1}^{s} {s ^ {n}}
$$ How can the smallest $x$ be found quickly. For $s = 10$ , $x$ is probably below 12'000, with $s = 11$ below 32'000, with $s = 12$ below 85'000, and so on. The $\sum_{n=1}^{s} {s ^ {n}}$ is a weird way to do ""bitwise OR"". What I'm trying to do is ensure there are no collisions, or written in another way, in case $s=3$ : $$
\lfloor\frac{h_1 x}{65536}\rfloor \not\equiv \lfloor\frac{h_2 x}{65536}\rfloor \not\equiv \lfloor\frac{h_3 x}{65536}\rfloor \bmod 3
$$ The function $f = (\lfloor\frac{h x}{65536}\rfloor \bmod s)$ is just an example. It is a ""supplemental hash function"", and is supposed to returns an integer between $0$ and $s$ with about equal probability. Any other function with the same property can be used instead. A good supplemental hash function is a bit more complex, but this one is good enough for my use case (it doesn't need to be perfect).","['number-theory', 'hash-function', 'modular-arithmetic', 'computer-science']"

I divided this proof up into 2 cases, where the sequence is convergent and the sequence is divergent.I am somewhat confident that I have shown this for the case where the sequence is convergent, and I am currently stumped on the case for divergent sequences. My intuition tells me that because the sequence is divergent, I can pick some $p\in \mathbb{R}$ and consider the subsequence of points which move farther and farther away from $p$, and that will give me my monotone subsequence. But in negating the definition of convergence I am only guaranteed that there exists some $\epsilon>0$ such that for any $N\in \mathbb{N}$, there exists an $n>N$ such that $|x_n-p|\geq \epsilon$, so these point can fluctuate between being exactly within $\epsilon$ of $p$ or more than $\epsilon$, and I don't have enough info about the behavior of the sequence to assure myself of a monotone subsequence.
