347088,How can i understand the graphical interpretation of Torsion of a curve?,"I understand the graphical interpretation of the curvature of a  curve in $\mathbb{R}^3$ .
Could you help me to understand the graphical meaning of the torsion of a curve?
I know that if torsion is positive, the curve goes through the osculating plane from below upwards.
Conversely, if torsion is negative, the curve goes through the osculating plane from above downwards. Question: How can I interpret torsion geometrically? For example, the curvature is the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle . Is there a similar interpretation for torsion?","['curves', 'differential-geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'curvature', 'osculating-circle']"
347094,Can you determine from the minors if the presented module is free?,"Motivation (you can ignore this part): A problem in Hartshorne (II.5.8c) asks to show that if we have a coherent sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on a reduced noetherian scheme $X$, and the function $$\varphi(x)=\dim_{k(x)} \mathscr{F}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x} k(x)$$ is constant on $X$ (where $k(x)$ is the residue field), then in fact $\mathscr{F}$ is locally free. (This is a homework problem for me.) I think that if $X$ is affine (say $=\operatorname{Spec}A$), then $\mathscr{F}$ will actually be free, not just locally. It will certainly be true that $\mathscr{F}$ will be the sheaf associated with a finitely generated $A$-module $M$, so there will be an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow K\rightarrow A^m \rightarrow M\rightarrow 0$$ for some $m\in\mathbb{N}$, and because $A$ is noetherian, $K$ will be finitely generated. Thus $M$ is a finitely presented module, say by the matrix $$\begin{pmatrix}
g_{11}&\dots& g_{1r}\\
\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\
g_{m1}&\dots& g_{mr}
\end{pmatrix}$$ Then if $x=\mathfrak{p}\triangleleft A$, $\mathscr{F}_x\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x}k(x) = M_\mathfrak{p}\otimes_{A_\mathfrak{p}}k(\mathfrak{p}) = M\otimes_A k(\mathfrak{p})$ is precisely the module presented by this matrix except with the entries interpreted as elements of $k(\mathfrak{p})$. The condition that $\varphi(x)$ is constant means that the rank of this matrix (with entries interpreted in $k(\mathfrak{p})$) doesn't depend on $\mathfrak{p}$. (Say it always $=s$.) Then the original matrix (entries interpreted in $A$) has the property that no $\mathfrak{p}\triangleleft A$ contains every $s\times s$ minor; however, every $\mathfrak{p}$ contains every $(s+1)\times (s+1)$ minor. The former condition means that the $s\times s$ minors generate the unit ideal in $A$. Since $A$ is presumed to be a reduced ring, the latter condition means that every $(s+1)\times(s+1)$ minor is zero. Now $\mathscr{F}$ is free iff $M$ is free. So if it's true that $X$ affine $\Rightarrow$ $\mathscr{F}$ is free (under the conditions of the question), then what I want to show is the plausible-to-me-seeming claim that if a matrix fulfills the conditions just described, then it presents a free module. It seems to me that if this is true it will not depend on the noetherian hypothesis on $A$, since all the relevant ideals and modules are already finitely generated. So - My question: Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity. Let $M$ be a finitely presented module over $A$. Say that $M$ is presented by an $m\times r$ matrix with the property that the $s\times s$ minors generate the unit ideal in $A$, but all the $(s+1)\times (s+1)$ minors are zero. Is it true that in this case $M$ is free, of rank $m-s$? If so, can you give me a hint toward a proof? (I have been having fun with this problem so far so I'd prefer less than a full solution.) My work so far: I checked this ""by hand"" in the simplest nontrivial case, that the matrix presenting $M$ is $2\times 1$ and $s=1$: suppose $a,b\in A$ and $M$ is presented by $\begin{pmatrix} a\\b\end{pmatrix}$. The condition on the $s\times s$ minors means $(a,b)=1$, so $\exists f,g\in A$ with $fa+gb=1$. (The condition on the $(s+1)\times(s+1)$ minors doesn't tell us anything because it's already forced by the shape of the matrix.) Then the $A$-linear map $$ r\mapsto \begin{pmatrix}gr\\-fr\end{pmatrix}$$ is an isomorphism of $A^1\rightarrow M$. It is injective because $gr=-fr=0$ implies that $r=r(fa+gb)=0+0=0$, and it is surjective because for arbitrary $\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}$ in $A^2$, take $r=bx-ay$, and then since $fa=1-gb$ and $gb=1-fa$, we have $$\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}gr\\-fr\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x-g(bx-ay)\\ y+f(bx-ay)\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}(1-gb)x+gay\\ (1-fa)y+fbx\end{pmatrix}=(fx+gy)\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}$$ which represents zero in $M$. I started to look at the next simplest case I could think of: I took $A=k[a,b,c,d]/(a+b+c+d-1,ad-bc)$ for $k$ some field, and was thinking about the module presented by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}$. I would like to show this matrix is isomorphic to $A^1$. I still haven't thought about minors bigger than $1\times 1$ generating the unit ideal, so I realized in the interest of time I should ask for help. A last thought: Suddenly while writing this I realized that the result I want is strongly reminiscent of the Quillen-Suslin theorem, as described in Michael Artin's Algebra . This makes me suspicious that the result I want won't be true in full generality. Any thoughts on the relation of my question to the Quillen-Suslin theorem would be appreciated as well.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

ODE: It can then be shown, by using the Banach fixed point theorem, that the sequence of ""Picard iterates"" $φ_k$ is convergent and that
  the limit is a solution to the problem. Exploiting the fact that the width of the interval where the local solution is defined is entirely determined by the Lipschitz constant of the function , one
  can assure global existence of the solution, i.e. the solution
  exists and is unique until it leaves the domain of definition of
  the ODE. An application of Grönwall's lemma to $|φ(t) − ψ(t)|$,
  where $φ$ and $ ψ$ are two solutions, shows that $φ(t) = ψ(t)$, thus
  proving the global uniqueness (the local uniqueness is a
  consequence of the uniqueness of the Banach fixed point). In the same article, it latter says The importance of this result is that the interval of definition of the solution does eventually not depend on the Lipschitz constant
  of the field , but essentially depends on the interval of
  definition of the field and its maximum absolute value of it. Wikipedia also mentions ... which (both Peano existence theorem and Picard–Lindelöf theorem) are both local results . ... When the hypotheses of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem are satisfied, then local existence and uniqueness can be extended to a
  global result . More precisely:[20] For each initial condition
  $(x_0, y_0)$ there exists a unique maximum (possibly infinite) open
  interval $$
        I_{max} = (x_-,x_+), x_\pm \in \mathbb{R}, x_0 \in I_{max} $$ such that any solution which satisfies this initial condition is a
  restriction of the solution which satisfies this initial condition
  with domain $I_{max}$. ...  Note that the maximum domain of the
  solution ... may depend on the specific choice of $(x_0, y_0)$. My questions: Global or local existence and uniqueness : I was wondering what ""local"" and ""global"" mean when referring  to existence and/or uniqueness of the solution to an ODE? In the second quote, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem is mentioned first as a local result, and the maximum domain $I_{max}$ of the solution both contains and depends on $(x_0, y_0)$, which is how I guess what ""local"" is. So why is the Picard–Lindelöf theorem said to be "" a global result"" in the second quote, and ""global existence"" and ""global uniqueness"" in the first quote ? Dependence on the Lipschitz constant : In the first article, it first says ""the width of the interval where the local solution is defined is entirely determined by the Lipschitz constant of the function"", but latter says ""the interval of definition of the solution does eventually not depend on the Lipschitz constant of the field"". I was wondering if it is self-contradicting?

( Added ) Here are some simple observations: Denote $S=support(x)=\{g\in F_2|x_g\neq 0\}$, and note that we have a disjoint union (or partition) $$F_2=\{e\}\cup S_a\cup S_{a^{-1}}\cup S_b\cup S_{b^{-1}}$$ where $e$ denotes the empty word in $F_2$, $S_a$ denotes the subset of all words (in reduced form) in $F_2$ that start with letter $a$, $S_{a^{-1}}, S_b, S_{b^{-1}}$ are defined similarly. Then, suppose $aS\cap bS=\emptyset$, then it is clear $$|\sum_{g\in F_2}x_g\overline{x_{ag}}|^2\leq (\sum_{g\in F_2}|x_g|^2)(\sum_{g\in F_2}|x_{ag}|^2)\leq \sum_{g\in F_2}|x_{ag}|^2= \sum_{g\in aS}|x_g|^2 $$ $$|\sum_{g\in F_2}x_g\overline{x_{bg}}|^2\leq (\sum_{g\in F_2}|x_g|^2)(\sum_{g\in F_2}|x_{bg}|^2)\leq \sum_{g\in F_2}|x_{bg}|^2= \sum_{g\in bS}|x_g|^2 $$ since $aS\cap bS=\emptyset$, $\sum_{g\in aS}|x_g|^2 +\sum_{g\in bS}|x_g|^2\leq \sum_{g\in F_2}|x_g|^2=1$, so the claim holds. Note that if $S\subset S_a\cup S_b\cup\{e\}$, then $aS\cap bS=\emptyset$ holds by considering the first letter is a word; but in general, $aS\cup bS\neq \emptyset$ can happen, for example, if $S\subset S_{a^{-1}}$, then
$aS\cup bS\neq \emptyset$ iff $S$ contains some reduced words of the form $a^{-1}ba^{-1}t, a^{-1}t$. (Using the fact $a(a^{-1}ba^{-1}t)=b(a^{-1}t)$). Similarly, you can find a result when $S\subset S_{b^{-1}}$. Based on the above simple observations, clearly, this problem involves very complicated stuff on combinatorics and inequality estimate, I get stuck in proving the general case, i.e., $S=support(x)$ is arbitrary set of $F_2$. So I believe if the claim holds in general, then there should be some advanced theory behind it that I do not know, perhaps group cohomology method etc. Note also that the claim can be thought as a claim on the upper norm bound gap (since it is clear that both are no bigger than 1 by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), so maybe some known rigidity result might be helpful to this problem, but still, I have no idea how to proceed the argument.","['sequences-and-series', 'geometric-group-theory', 'group-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'combinatorics']"
347787,Proof that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{\sin(kx)}{k^2}$ convergences uniformly using the Cauchy criterion,"I'd like to use the Cauchy criterion to show that $$f_n(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n\frac{\sin(kx)}{k^2} \mbox{convergences uniformly} $$ Here is what I did: We want to show that $\forall \, \varepsilon_1>0 \, \exists \, n_1 \in \mathbb N$ such that $\forall \, n,m ≥ n_1 \, \left\lvert \, f_n(x)-f_m(x) \right\rvert < \varepsilon_1 \, \forall \, x \in \mathbb R $. Let $\varepsilon_1>0$. At this point we recall that $\sum\limits_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k^2}$ is convergent. That means it's Cauchy. So we know that $\forall \, \varepsilon_2 > 0 \, \exists \, n_2 \in \mathbb N$ such that $\forall \, n,m ≥ n_2 \, \left\lvert \sum\limits_{k=m+1}^n\frac{1}{k^2} \right\rvert< \varepsilon_2 $. Very nice, maybe we could use it. Let $\varepsilon_2 = \varepsilon_1$, and then $n_1=n_2$. Now $\forall \, n,m ≥ n_1 , \, \forall \, x \in \mathbb R$: \begin{align} 
|f_n(x)-f_m(x)| &= \Big|\sum\limits_{k=m+1}^n\frac{\sin(kx)}{k^2}\Big|

347788,"If A is a denumerable set, and there exists a surjective function from A to B, then B is denumerable","I am having some trouble solving the following homework question and some help would be greatly appreciated!! Q: Prove that if $A$ is a denumerable set, and there exists a surjective function from $A$ to $B$, then $B$ is denumerable. My intuition: Since $A$ is denumerable, we can write $A$ as ${a1,a2,a3...}$. Furthermore, since there is a surjective function from $A$ to $B$, then every element of $B$ is mapped to an element of $A$. Thus, it makes sense to say that since $A$ is denumerable and every element of $B$ is being mapped to $A$, then $B$ is denumerable. Thus, we can write $B$ as ${b1,b2,b3...}$. This seems logical however I feel as though it is not a complete and mathematical proof .

347933,Compute the inverse Laplace transform of $e^{-\sqrt{z}}$,"I want to compute the inverse Laplace transform of a function

This problem seems very nontrivial to me. Here one can find the answer: the inverse Laplace transform of one variable function $e^{-\sqrt{z}}$ is equal to
$$
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}[e^{-\sqrt{z}}](x) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\pi}} x^{-\frac{3}{2}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{4x} \right).
$$
But what is the simpliest way to do it? Post's formula requires knowledge of all degree derivatives of $e^{-\sqrt{z}}$ and I think that it isn't a good way. The classical inversion formula is of the form
$$
    \mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(z)](x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i}\int\limits_{\sigma - i \infty}^{\sigma + i \infty} F(z) e^{zx}\,dz = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int\limits_{\sigma - i \infty}^{\sigma + i \infty} e^{-\sqrt{z}+zx} \, dz.
$$
To compute it I make a substitution $p = \sqrt{z}$. Then I'm looking for the image of the line $\sigma + i \mathbb{R}$. If I'm not mistaken it is the angle with vertice at $\sqrt{\sigma}$ and with rays $\sqrt{\sigma} + e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} [0,\infty)$ and $\sqrt{\sigma}+e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} [0,\infty)$ (not exactly, these rays are curvilinear, but I think that this doesn't matter because of Cauchy formula). I will denote it $\Lambda$. So 
$$
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}[e^{-\sqrt{z}}] = \frac{1}{\pi i} \int\limits_{\Lambda} e^{-p + p^2 x}p \, dp.
