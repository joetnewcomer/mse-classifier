952221,How to derive the standard symplectic form on a 2-sphere in cylindrical polar coordinates?,"I have already know that at a point $p\in S^2$ with $u,v$ the tangent vectors at $p$. Then the standard symplectic form is $\omega_p(u,v) :=\langle p,\,u\times v\rangle$ where $u\times v$ is the outer product. My question is: How can one deduce from this that the symplectic form is $dz\wedge d\theta$ in the cylindrical polar coordinates $(z,\theta)$ on $S^2$? Here, $z$ is the height and $\theta$ is the angle. Thanks.","['geometry', 'differential-forms', 'symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

952445,Lower bound for $ F(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty d(n)z^n $ near radius of convergence.,"In Stein and Sharkarchi Problem 2.7.2 one is asked to find a lower bound $$ |F(z)| \geq c\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) $$ for the function $$ F(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty d(n)z^n $$ near the radius of convergence $ R $. Here $ d(n) $ is the number of divisors of $ n $. I have already established $ R = 1 $ and the identity $$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty d(n)z^n = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{1-z^n}. $$ Furthermore, when $ z $ is a real number $ r $ then clearly $$ F(r) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{r^n}{1-r^n} \geq \int_1^\infty \frac{r^n}{1-r^n} dn = -\frac{1}{\log(r)}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) $$ by substituting $ u = 1-r^n $ and integrating. Since $ r \to 1 $ I have $ \log(r) = (r-1) + O((r-1)^2) \approx (r-1) $ and thus $$ F(r) \geq c\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right), $$ for some constant $ c $ coming from the approximation of $ \log(r) \approx (r-1) $. In the problem I have to establish the same lower bound when $ z = re^{i\theta} $ for some $ \theta = 2\pi p/q $ with $ p $ and $ q $ integers. Can I somehow use a similar approach for this? or do I need to do something completely different? Edit #1 : added difinition of $ d(n) $. Edit #2 : Okay, I think I have an answer now. Maybe someone can verify or deny it. Let $ N_q := \{n\in \mathbb{N}\mid q\ \text{does not divide}\ n \} $ and consider the follwing splitting of the sum $$ |F(z)| = \left|\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{1-z^n}\right| = \left|\underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{z^{qn}}{1-z^{qn}}}_{=: A} + \underbrace{\sum_{n\in N_q}\frac{z^n}{1-z^n}}_{=: B}\right|. $$ Now part $ A $ is strictly real so with $ z = r $ we have as before $$ A \geq c_A\frac{1}{1-r^q}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r^q}\right) \geq c_A\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) $$ since $ r < 1 $. For part $ B $ we have th following observation. Since $ e^{ik\theta} = e^{ik\theta}e^{iq\theta} = e^{i(k+q)\theta} $ clearly we only have $ q-1 $ directions to worry about and let $ k' $ be defined such that $ e^{ik'\theta} $ is the closest to 1 when following the unitcicle perimiter. Let $ c_B = \min\{1,\inf\{|1-re^{ik'\theta}|\mid 0< r <1 \}\} $ then we have $$ |B| \leq \sum_{n\in N_q}\frac{|z|^n}{|1-z^n|} \leq \sum_{n\in N_q}\frac{|z|^n}{c_B} \leq \frac{c_B^{-1}}{1-|z|} = \frac{c_B^{-1}}{1-r} $$. Now, since $ A \geq 0 $ we have $ |A+B|\geq A-|B| $ and thus $$ F(z) \geq A - |B| \geq c_A\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) - |B| \geq c_A\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) - \frac{c_B^{-1}}{1-r}, $$ but this we can rewrite at bit $$ c_A\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) - \frac{c_B^{-1}}{1-r} = c_A\frac{1}{1-r}\left(\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) - c_B^{-1}\right) $$ and since $ \log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) \gg c_B^{-1} $ as $ r \to 1 $ we simply have $$ F(z) \geq c_{p/q}\frac{1}{1-r}\log\left(\frac{1}{1-r}\right) $$ for some constant $ c_{p/q} $. Edit #3 : I realize that there was something wrong. I should probably assume $ p $ and $ q $ relatively prime.",['complex-analysis']

952466,Is there a bijection of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with itself such that the forward map is connected but the inverse is not?,"Let $(X,\tau), (Y,\sigma)$ be two topological spaces. We say that a map $f: \mathcal{P}(X)\to \mathcal{P}(Y)$ between their power sets is connected if for every $S\subset X$ connected, $f(S)\subset Y$ is connected. Question : Assume $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bijection, where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is equipped with the standard topology. Does the connectedness of (the induced power set map) $f$ imply that of $f^{-1}$ ? Full disclosure: I've now crossposted the question on MO . Various remarks If we remove the bijection requirement then the answer is clearly ""no"". For example, $f(x) = \sin(x)$ when $n = 1$ is a map whose forward map preserves connectedness but the inverse map does not. With the bijection, it holds true in $n = 1$ . But this is using the order structure of $\mathbb{R}$ : a bijection that preserves connectedness on $\mathbb{R}$ must be monotone. As a result of the invariance of domain theorem if either $f$ or $f^{-1}$ is continuous, we must have that $f$ is a homeomorphism, which would imply that both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ must be connected. (See Is bijection mapping connected sets to connected homeomorphism? which inspired this question for more about this.) Invariance of domain, in fact, asserts a positive answer to the following question which is very similar in shape and spirit to the one I asked above: Assume $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bijection, where $\mathbb{R}^n$ is equipped with the standard topology. Does the fact that $f$ is an open map imply that $f^{-1}$ is open? Some properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$ must factor in heavily in the answer. If we replace the question and consider, instead of self-maps of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard topology to itself, self-maps of some arbitrary topological space, it is easy to make the answer go either way. For example, if the topological space $(X,\tau)$ is such that there are only finitely many connected subsets of $X$ (which would be the case if $X$ itself is a finite set), then by the cardinality argument we have that the answer is yes, $f^{-1}$ must also be connected. On the other hand, one can easily cook up examples where the answer is no; a large number of examples can be constructed as variants of the following: let $X = \mathbb{Z}$ be equipped with the topology generated by: $$ \{\mathbb{N}\} \cup \{ \{k\} \mid k \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \mathbb{N} \} $$ Then the map $k \mapsto k+\ell$ for any $\ell > 0$ maps connected sets to connected sets, but its inverse $k\mapsto k-\ell$ can map connected sets to disconnected ones. Working a bit harder one can construct in similar vein examples which are Hausdorff.","['general-topology', 'connectedness', 'metric-spaces', 'examples-counterexamples']"

For the equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$, it says That is, he planned to show that if $x$ and $y$ are such that the factors $x+y, x+ry, \dots, x+r^{n-1}y$ are relatively prime then $x^n + y^n = z^n$ implies that each of the factors $x+y, x+ry, \dots$ must itself be an $n$th power and to derive from this an impossible infinite descent. If $x+y, x+ry, \dots$ are not relatively prime he planned to show that there is a factor $m$ common to all of them so that $(x+y)/m, (x+ry)/m, \dots, (x+r^{n-1}y)/m$ are relatively prime and to apply a similar argument in this case as well.

This (admittedly complex) definition is about the weakest reasonable interpretation of ""angle-preserving"" that I can think of, and it doesn't require $f$ to be differentiable (or even continuous, although I'll assume that for convenience). In words it says that the angle $\angle f(p+x),f(p),f(p+y)$ is close to $\cos^{-1}\phi$ whenever $x,y$ are sufficiently small and have angle $\cos^{-1}\phi$ between them. For example, the function $f(x)=xg(x/|x|)$ where $g$ is a nonconstant continuous positive real function on the unit circle is a non-differentiable, non-conformal continuous map that is angle-preserving at $0$. For comparison, a map is conformal at $p$ if it is differentiable at $p$ and there is a $\lambda$ such that $\langle df_p(x),df_p(y)\rangle=\lambda\langle x,y\rangle$ for all $x,y\in\Bbb R^2$, i.e. it preserves inner products up to a scale, which implies angle-preservation and length-preservation (up to an overall local scale factor). Now, the example above shows that ""angle-preserving at $p$"" is strictly weaker than ""conformal at $p$"", but the statement I'd like to prove is that ""locally angle-preserving at $p$"" and ""locally conformal at $p$"" are equivalent, which boils down to: If $f:\Bbb R^2\to\Bbb R^2$ is an angle-preserving continuous function, then $f$ is conformal. This question covers the case when $f$ is additionally known to be differentiable, but I am interested in this looser interpretation of ""angle-preserving"".","['quasiconformal-maps', 'derivatives', 'conformal-geometry', 'real-analysis', 'complex-analysis']"

953676,"The set of rationals in $(0,1)$ is not a $G_\delta$","The set of rational numbers in the interval $(0,1)$ cannot be expressed as the intersection of a countable collection of open sets I found this proof on a certain web page A direct proof would be to show that if $A_k$ is a countable family of open sets whose intersection contains only the rationals then the intersection of the $A_k$ must contain an uncountable number of points. That's a contradiction. Show you can assume the family is nested. Then the general idea is to show that for each of the open intervals in one of the sets $A_i$, there is an $A_n ~;n>i$ that contains at least two open intervals contained the original interval whose size is less than half the original interval. So the intervals split endlessly. There are an uncountable numbers of ways of following this splitting down to a limit point. Query: I understood the strategy and most of the part of this answer except the one in blue box. It says that for any open set $A_i$, we can find an $A_n$ such that $A_n$ contains at least two open intervals contained in $A_i$? Attempt: I am trying to reason the above as follows : None of the open sets in $\cap A_k$ can be disjoint from each other, else, the intersection will be the empty set contrary to our assumption. This means, for any two open sets $A_i,A_j$ in the collection $\cap A_k : A_i \cap A_j \ne \{\phi \}$ . $ A_i \cap A_j$ is an open set, hence, it contains an open interval $I$. This interval $I$ can be split endlessly and in uncountable ways. But, whichever, split interval we get, it will always have a lot more numbers than the rationals. Hence, any such interval must be uncountable contrary to our assumption. Did I infer it correctly?

953775,Geometric intuition for mixed partial derivatives,"I'm trying to better understand exactly what $f_{xy}(x,y)$ at a point is geometrically, and possibly understand why $f_{xy}$ and $f_{yx}$ should be equivalent, not just because the math happened to make it so. For example, $f_{xx}$ would be like looking at the concavity of the function in only the $x$ direction. My real question is about how the second partial derivative test works. $$D(x,y)=f_{xx}(x,y)f_{yy}(x,y)-(f_{xy}(x,y))^2$$ I can see that the sign of the first term can be interpreted as whether or not the concavity in both the $x$ and $y$ directions are in the same direction. For a critical point $(a,b)$, if the concavities are opposite, then we have a saddle point. It's also easy to see that $D(a,b)<0$. When the concavities do agree, then $f_{xy}$ starts to play a role in the sign of $D$. My current understanding on why this is necessary, is because looking at the second derivatives at only the $x$ and $y$ directions doesn't quite give the entire picture on what is happening at $(a,b)$, but including $f_{xy}$ gives sufficient information to determine if $(a,b)$ is truly a local extremum or a saddle point instead (given that $D\neq0$). My problem is that I still don't exactly get what sort of information $f_{xy}$ entails for a given point.","['multivariable-calculus', 'intuition', 'partial-derivative']"

By drawing a cube on a paper or by seeing it on a screen (a 2D surface - see Figure below), we can sort of visualise how a 3D cube would look like. I was wondering whether we will be able to visualise the tessaract (4D cube) if we build a 3D model of it? However, if we are able to, it will contradict the common belief that one (as a 3D organism) cannot visualise the 4th Dimension. This leads to the question below. Question: What is the fundamental difference between seeing the 4th dimensions in 3-dimensions and seeing the 3rd dimension in 2D view that stops us from being able to extend our understanding of the 3D to 4D? Well, some thoughts so far is that to visualize depth in 3D, we use light/shading (for example a 3D object looks lighter nearer to the edge and darker in the centre). The 4th dimension is time/duration, so a question would whether we can make use of time (e.g. moving the object through time???) to help us visualise the 4th dimension better???
