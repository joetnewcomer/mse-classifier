2039672,Number of triangles formed by n lines and m parallel lines.,"This question was posted back in 2012, but a proper answer was never given.
Here's the question I'm stuck on: ""How many triangles are formed by $n$ lines, and $m$ parallel lines, where no 3 lines can intersect at one point."" These $m$ parallel lines are all parallel to each other, so all $m$ lines have the same slope.  I've been trying to draw out cases and cannot find some type of pattern.  Any help would be great. We did this for $n$ non-parallel lines, and found out that the amount of triangles formed was $\binom{n}{3}$. So we'd have $n-m$ non-parallel lines, and we were trying to find a pattern by drawming more lines, and more non/parallel lines with no success.","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'geometry']"
2039719,"Sheaves on basic open sets of an affine scheme, confused about Vakil's notes","I thought I was generally getting my head around the sheaf structure defined by basic open sets for an affine scheme, but a line of a proof in Ravi Vakil's notes found here (page 130) has me confused. So for a ring $A$ with $s \in A$, $s$ defines a global section of the structure sheaf on $\text{spec}A$ given by taking $s \pmod{\mathfrak{p}}$. To show the identifying property for the structure sheaf, Vakil supposes that the restriction of $s$ to a basic open set, $D(f)$, is $0$. That is, he assumes,
$$ \text{res}_{\text{specA}, D(f)}s = 0. $$
He then concludes that this means that there is some integer $m$ such that $f^{m}s = 0$. I am confused about why he draws this conclusion. My reasoning was as follows: If $s$ is zero on the restriction to $D(f)$, then it means that every prime ideal not containing $f$ must contain $s$. This is equivalent to saying that every prime ideal contains $fs$. In other words, $fs$ is the zero function on $\text{spec}A$. In other words again, $fs$ is in the nilradical. But then why does Vakil say that there is an $m$ such that $f^{m}s = 0$? If he meant $fs$ as an element of $A$, then surely he means $(fs)^{m} = 0$, and if he was talking about $fs$ as a global section, then he meant $fs = 0$ as a function. So why $f^{m}s = 0$? What am I missing? Thanks","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
2039720,Prove that $R$ is a ring with division.,"I'm having problems trying to know if my proof is wrong or not. The problem states: Let $R$ a ring with 1, not necessary commutative, such that for every $a\in R\setminus\{0\}$, there exists $b\in R\setminus\{0\}$ (which depends on $a$) such that $a\cdot b=1$. Prove that $R$ is a division ring. I have almost everything to prove that is a ring with division, I think I only miss the part that $b\cdot a=1$, what I have done so far is the following: We have $ab=1$ so multiplying $b$ on the left side we have
$$b\cdot a\cdot b=b\cdot 1$$
Since $1$ is the $1$ of $R$, we get:
$$b\cdot a\cdot b=1\cdot b$$
(this is the part I'm not sure about) since we are in a group, we can cancel $b$ on the left side 
$$a\cdot b=1$$
and we are done?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"
2039764,Geometry of $2 \times 2$ matrix mappings,"Suppose $\mathbf{A}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix. I'm interested in the geometry of the mapping $T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. The effect on the vectors $\mathbf{e_1} = (1,0)$ and $\mathbf{e_2} = (0,1)$ is clear -- $T(\mathbf{e_1})$ and $T(\mathbf{e_2})$ are just the columns of $\mathbf{A}$. So, by linearity, a unit square gets mapped to a parallelogram. The green square gets mapped to the pink parallelogram in the pictures below. Now let's consider the effect on  a unit circle. It gets mapped to an ellipse, and I'm interested in how the geometry of this ellipse is related to the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. One case seems clear: if $\mathbf{A}$ is symmetric, then the axes of the ellipse are the eignevectors of $\mathbf{A}$, and its semi-axis lengths are the eigenvalues. The ""stretching"" of the circle to form the ellipse is nicely related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Fabulous. This is illustrated in the following picture: Another case is also clear: if the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$ are not real, then presumably there is no relationship whatsoever to the geometry of the ellipse. Now the case that's puzzling me: what if $\mathbf{A}$ is not symmetric, but still has real eigenvalues. What sort of geometric relationship exists in this case, if any? This case is illustrated in the following picture:","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'linear-transformations', 'geometry', 'conic-sections', 'linear-algebra']"

2039867,Elliptic curves as branched coverings of $\mathbb{CP}^1$,"Any smooth projective curve $X$ of genus one admits a morphism $f:X\to\mathbb{P}^1$ of degree 2, which by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula is ramified at exactly four points. Given a $4$-tuple $\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4\}\subset\mathbb{P}^1$, I would like to give an explicit such morphism ramified exactly at $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_4$. How can I do this? For instance, for $\{\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\infty=[1:0]\}\subset\mathbb{P}^1$ we can consider \begin{equation} X=\{[x:y:z]\in\mathbb{P}^2\mid zy^2=(x-\alpha_1z)(x-\alpha_2z)(x-\alpha_3z)\}, \end{equation} which is the closure in $\mathbb{P}^2$ of the affine curve $\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2\mid y^2=(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)(x-\alpha_3)\}$, and the morphism $F:X\to\mathbb{P}^1$ given by
 \begin{equation}
    F([x:y:z]) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        \left[1:0\right] & \text{if } [x:y:z]=[0:1:0]\\
        \left[x:z\right] & \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right\}, 
  \end{equation} which looks like $(x,y)\mapsto x$ on the open chart $\mathbb{C}^2$. This construction satisfies all my requirements (in particular, $X$ is smooth). However, if I take $\{\alpha_1,..,\alpha_4\}\subset\mathbb{P}^1\setminus\{\infty\}$ and I consider the curve \begin{equation} Y=\{[x:y:z]\in\mathbb{P}^2\mid z^2y^2=(x-\alpha_1z)(x-\alpha_2z)(x-\alpha_3z)(x-\alpha_4z)\},\end{equation} then $Y$ has a singular point at $[0:1:0]$, and the corresponding morphism $Y\to\mathbb{P}^1$ is ramified at $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_4$ $\textbf{and}$ $\infty=[1:0]$, so this construction doesn't satisfy my requirements.

2039880,On solutions of a certain $n\times n$ linear system whose coefficients are all $\pm1$,"Let $n>2$ and $A \in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ be a $\{-1,1\}$-matrix (whose elements are $-1$ or $1$).

Prove or disprove that if $Ax=0$ has only the trivial solution, then $v$ has at least two identical elements. For example,

I couldn't find a counterexample, so for the moment I'm assuming it is indeed true. Perhaps the more pertinent issue I'm having is not knowing where to start, given the peculiar structure of the matrix and of $b$. I considered proving the contrapositive (if $v_1 = \ ...\  = v_n$, then there exists some nonzero/nontrivial solution to $Ax = 0$), but I didn't get far with that. I appreciate all help, even if it's just a nudge in the right direction (or if anyone finds a counterexample). Thank you kindly! Edit: In addition, I have not found a counterexample for the case where each $a_{ij}$ is either $-\delta$ or $\delta$ for $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$, so if the initial statement is indeed true, then something that would point to this fact would be optimal (or at the very least interesting).

I want to prove that if $\cal{U}$ is the set of all neighborhoods of $e$ (the identity element), then $\overline{\{e\}}=\cap_{U\in \cal{U}}U$. What I thought was: i) If $x\in \overline{\{e\}}$, then every neighborhood $V$ of $x$ intersects $\{e\}$, hence every $V$ is a neighborhood of $e$ as well, i.e. $V\in \cal{U}$. ii) On the other hand, if $x\in \cap_{U\in \cal{U}}U$, then $x\in U$ for all $U \in \cal{U}$, meaning every $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ intersecting $\{e\}$. Now, I think that the missing part is an argument justifying that there is no neighborhood of $e$ that is not a neighborhood of $x$ (part i) ), and that there is no neighborhood of $x$ that is not a neighborhood of $e$ (part ii) ). My idea for this is to argue that there is a homeomorphism taking $e$ to $x$, therefore the neighborhood system of one cannot have more elements that the neighborhood system of the other.

I know I have to find both $ax'$ and $b'$, so here's how I think I should do it...please tell me if I'm crazy and wrong: As $b$ is a constant it follows that $b' = 0$. My textbook hasn't gone into this yet, so it isn't clear why. Anyway, moving on. This leaves us with: $$ax' = a$$ What I REALLY don't understand is why we don't use the product rule for $ax$.

2040341,When Two Connections Determine the Same Geodesics,"It's my first question!  I hope I'm correctly formatting it. I'm trying to prove that two connections $\nabla, \widetilde{\nabla}$ on a manifold determine the same geodesics iff their difference tensor is alternating.  The difference tensor of two connections is the tensor $D(X,Y) = \widetilde{\nabla}_XY - \nabla_XY$, so this is saying that the geodesics are the same for the two connections iff $D(X,Y) = -D(Y,X)$ for all vector fields $X, Y$ on $M$. Since $D$ is a tensor it can be written as a sum of its symmetric and alternating parts, $D = S + A$.  Since $A(X,X) \equiv 0$ we have $D(X,X) = S(X,X)$.  So if $S(X,X) = 0$ then so does $D(X,X)$, and if $D(X,X)$ is always $0$, then $$ D(X+Y,X+Y) =S(X+Y, X+Y) = S(X,X) + S(Y,Y) + 2S(X,Y) = 2S(X,Y)$$ Then $S(X,Y) \equiv 0$.  So it's enough to check that having the same geodesics is the same as $D(X,X) \equiv 0$.  This observation was made in Spivak Vol. II Ch. 6, Addendum 1, but his proof that this latter condition is equivalent to the connections having the same geodesics doesn't make sense to me. Does anyone know how to show that if the connections have the same geodesics then the difference tensor is $0$ on the diagonal?  That's the direction I'm stuck on.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'connections', 'geodesic']"
2040363,Comparing LU or QR decompositions for solving least squares,"Let $X \in R^{m\times n}$ with $m>n$. We aim to solve $y=X\beta$ where $\hat\beta$ is the least square estimator. The least squares solution for
  $\hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ can be obtained using QR decomposition
  on $X$ and $LU$ decomposition on $X^TX$. The aim to compare these. I noticed that we can use Cholesky decomposition instead of $LU$, since $X^TX$ is symmetric and positive definite. Using $LU$ we have: $\hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty=(LU)^{-1}X^Ty$, solve $a=X^Ty$ which is order $O(2nm)$, then $L^{-1}b=a$ at cost $\sum_1^{k=n} (2k-1)$ and finally $U^{-1}a$ at the same cost of $\sum_1^{k=n} (2k-1)$. I didn't count the cost of computing $L^{-1}$ and $U^{-1}$. Using $QR$ we have: $\hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty=((QR)^TQR)^{-1}R^TQ^Ty=R^{-1}Q^Ty$, where we solve $Q^Ty=a$ at cost $O(n^2)$ and $R^{-1}a$ with cost $\sum_1^{k=n} (2k-1)$. Comparing the decompositions: It seems that QR decomposition is much better than LU. I think the cost of computing QR is higher than LU, which is why we could prefer to use LU. On the other hand if we are given the decompositions, we should use QR. $SVD$ decomposition: Is there any advantage to use SVD decomposition?","['least-squares', 'matrices', 'matrix-decomposition', 'statistics', 'linear-algebra']"

To examine whether at present time $μ$ is greater than $200$ mg, it is agreed that daily caffeine consumption of a random sample of $100$ adults be examined.  If the sample mean is greater than $203.50$, the decision will be to reject the null hypothesis. The following information may be useful: pnorm(0.67) $=0.75$, pnorm(1) $=0.84,$ pnorm(1.56) $=0.94$, pnorm(2.33) $=0.99$ (a) What are the null and alternative hypotheses? (b) What is the test statistic and what is it distribution? (c) What is the probability of a Type 1 error? (d) What is the power of the test if the true mean is 205mg? (e) Is the assumption that the population distribution of daily caffeine consumption is normal necessary
for the hypothesis test? Explain your reasoning. My answers: (a) $H_0: μ \le 200$ (average daily caffeine consumption is at most $200mg$) $H_1: μ > 200$ (average daily caffeine consumption is more than $200mg$) (b) For large sample, and known population standard deviation, use 1-sample $Z$ test. Distribution: Normal. $$Z=\frac{\bar X-μ}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
=\frac{203.50-200}{15/10}

Compute $X_\text{critical}$ by substituting the value in following Z score formula $Z =1.64=\frac{X_\text{critical}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{X_\text{critical}-200}{1.5}$ $X_\text{critical}=202.46$ $$P(\bar X<202.46)=P\left(Z<\frac{202.46-205}{1.5}\right)=P(Z<-1.69333333)=0.0455.$$ Power of test: $1-0.0455 =0.9545.$ (e) Not necessary because the sample size is sufficiently large.

2040434,The Projection Matrix is Equal to its Transpose [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why is a projection matrix symmetric? (4 answers) Closed 7 years ago . By inspecting its formula one can see easily that the matrix for projection onto a subspace is equal to its transpose. But what is the underlying ""geometric"" reason for this equality?  I have hard time figuring out why it has to be so? EDIT:
After reviewing the suggested links, it became more clear, but the reasoning was still escaping my intuition.    However, I think that I can (based on the formal arguments in the links) put forward a rough argument.  Basically, for any operator $A$ and two vectors $x$, $y$ $$<Ax,y>=<x,A^Ty>$$ For a vector $y$ in the orthogonal complement to the subspace S we're projecting onto using the $P^S$ projection operator, $$<P^Sx,y>=0=<x,(P^S)^Ty>$$ Because we took any vector $x$, it means that $(P^S)^Ty=0$.  As $y$ is in the orthogonal complement, $P^Sy=0$ this means that $$(P^S)^Ty=0=P^Sy$$
(in plain English, for any vector in the orthogonal complement to $S$ the action of $P^S$ makes it 0, which is a symmetric action). For $y$ in $S$ and any $x$, $<P^Sx,y>=<x,y>$ and $P^Sy=y$ (by the properties of the projection operation), but also $<P^Sx,y>=<x,(P^S)^Ty>$ (true for any operator). Putting these together that yields that:$$(P^S)^Ty=y=P^Sy$$. (in plain English, for any vector in $S$ the action of $P^S$ is the identity, which is a symmetric action). To sum it up, this shows that the operator $P^S$ acts symmetrically on both elements of S and on elements in its orthogonal complement.  Being that it is a linear operator, then it acts symmetrically on all vectors $x$. A big thing why this works (I think) is that the concept of projection implies (finite) dimension inner product space and that is much more structured than a simple (finite) dimensional vector space. LAST EDIT:
Even more clear after digesting the answer of Trial and Error. Given a subspace M to project onto, any vector $z_1$ can be written as the sum of two orthogonal components: $$z_1= (z_1-P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1) + P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1,$$ But the key geometric thing is that these two components belong to orthogonal subspaces , M and $\perp M$ (any vector from one subspace is perpendicular on any vector from the other subspace). The projection operator will leave the  component in M unchanged and annihilate the component in $\perp M$. Because of the fact that the subspaces themselves are orthogonal the product of ANY two arbitrary vectors $z_1, z_2$ $$<z_1,z_2>=<(z_1-P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1) + P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1,(z_2-P_{\mathcal{M}}z_2) + P_{\mathcal{M}}z_2>$$
becomes (by the orthogonality of M and $\perp M$:
$$<z_1,z_2>=<(z_1-P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1),(z_2-P_{\mathcal{M}}z_2)>+<P_{\mathcal{M}}z_1,P_{\mathcal{M}}z_2>$$ But applying $P_M$ annihilates/zeroes the first bracket and leaves unchanged the second bracket.  This holds whether we apply it to $z_1$ or to $z_2$ . Ergo the effect of $P_M$ is the same whether applied to the first of second term of the scalar product.  So its matrix should be equal to its transpose. The bolded text indicates key issues that I was not fully appreciating before.

However, in the line below, the integral is over $[0,1]^k$. It amounts to the same  thing, since ${I^k}_{(i,\alpha)}^*(f dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge \widehat{dx^i} \wedge ... \wedge dx^k) = f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^i, ..., x^{k-1})\,dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge dx^{k-1}$ and then $$ \begin{aligned}& \int_{[0,1]^{k-1}}f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^i, ..., x^{k-1})\,dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge dx^{k-1} \\ = & \int_{[0,1]}\left(\int_{[0,1]^{k-1}}f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^i, ..., x^{k-1})\,dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge dx^{k-1}\right)dx^k \\ = & \int_{[0,1]^{k}}f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^i, ..., x^{k-1})\,dx^1 \wedge ... \wedge dx^k \\ = & \int_{[0,1]^{k}}f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^{i}, ..., x^{k-1})\,dx^1 ... dx^k \\ = & \int_{[0,1]^{k}}f(x^1, ..., x^{i-1},\alpha,x^{i+1}, ..., x^{k})\,dx^1 ... dx^k\end{aligned}$$ where the second line follows since the pulled back form is constant with respect to $x^k$ and the last line follows since we're working with the Riemann integral over $[0,1]^k$ so we're really just renaming variables.

More precisely, $S_i = \{ (x_1,\ldots, x_{i-1},0,x_{i+1},\ldots, x_n):\ x_1^2+\ldots+x_{i-1}^2+x_{i+1}^2+\ldots+x_n^2=1 \}$. The image below gives an illustration in the 3 dimensional case.

I was trying to explain basic ideas of representation of Lie Groups to an 11 years old girl who asked what I was studying. What I wanted to explain was the relation between special functions and symmetries. The mathematical thing I wanted to explain was that if we have a group $G$ acting on a space $X$, and we look at the space of infinitely derivable functions on $X$, i.e. $\mathcal C^\infty(X)$, then there is a natural representation of $G$ on $C^\infty(X)$. So I thought about the simplest example I had in mind which was the case of of the circle $G = S^1$ which has ($SO(2)$ symmetry). Then the representation are given by harmonic analysis of Fourier series. To explain this I said to consider a glass of water which has cylindrical symmetry (""if I rotate the glass you cannot say how much I did rotate the glass, so it has a symmetry"") then the vibration and deformations of the edge of the glass are the functions on $S^1$ that can be classified in harmonics... That's why - I concluded - glasses are used to sing with water... I said that but really I'm not sure at all if it's effectively the case. I mean that I'm note sure until what extension my reasoning was correct. Is the role of the water just the one to annihilate every representation but one (or some) which get excited and that's why the glass emits only one definite sound?

Edit #2: In the comment below one user has given an incredibly useful link that explains the origin of that formula.

one of them has been chosen at random to be
executed and the other two are to be freed. Prisoner
A asks the jailer to tell him privately which of
his fellow prisoners will be set free, claiming that
there would be no harm in divulging this information
because he already knows that at least one of
the two will go free. The jailer refuses to answer
the question, pointing out that if A knew which
of his fellow prisoners were to be set free, then
his own probability of being executed would rise
from $\frac 13$ to $\frac 12$ because he would then be one of two
prisoners. What do you think of the jailer’s
reasoning? If the jailer refuses to say anything, then the probability that prisoner $A$ is excecuted is $\frac{1}{3}$ . If the jailer says to prisoner $A$ that prisoner $B$ will walk free, then $2$ prisoners remain to be considered, $A$ and $C$ . One dies, one does not. Heads or tails essentially. $\frac{1}{2}$ ought to be the conditional probability that $A$ dies given that $B$ walks free no? Apparently not though, allegedly the correct answer is still $\frac{1}{3}$ . Even my attempt to calculate the correct answer yielded the result $\frac{1}{2}$ . Let $A_D$ and $C_D$ respectively denote the event of $A$ and $C$ dying. Let $B_F$ denote the event that $B$ walks free. Assume that the jailer tells prisoner $A$ that prisoner $B$ will walk free.

2042207,How to understand the projective compactification of a vector bundle?,"The following question confused me a bit: Given a rank $n$ vector bundle or locally free sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$, each fiber of this vector bundle is a vector space of dimension $n$. Therefore, we can compactify it into a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. And if we do this compatibly for every fiber we get a $\mathbb{P}^n$-projective bundle. Now my question is whether this projective bundle is $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$ or $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Here by $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{F})$ for some locally free sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ I mean the projective bundle of hyperplanes (instead of the projective bundle of lines). At first I thought the answer should be $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Then something seems to be wrong. If I consider the zero section of the vector bundle $
\mathcal{E}$, it can also be viewed as a section of the projective bundle $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Then it should corresponds to the surjection $\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow 0$ by sending $\mathcal{E}$ to $0$ because what else it can be. However if I consider a concrete example, namely the blowing up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ at a point, this is not the case. The blow-up can be viewed as a $\mathbb{P}^1$-projective bundle (i.e. ruled surface) over $\mathbb{P}^1$. Let $X=\mathbb{P}^1$. Then the resulting space of the blow-up is $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Therefore, we can also see it as the projective compactification of the line bundle $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. But then the surjection
$$
\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow 0
$$
actually determines the section at infinity, which is the exceptional divisor of the blow-up. Instead, for any section $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$, there is a natural map
$$
\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(1)
$$
given by multiplication of $s$. Therefore, when considered as a section of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$, $s$ is determined by the induced surjection
$$
\mathcal{O}_X(1)\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(1)\rightarrow 0.
$$ This example makes me believe that the projective compactification of $\mathcal{E}$ is actually $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Now everything seems to be consistent. Let $s\in H^0(X,\mathcal{E})$. Then we have a map
$$
\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow\mathcal{E} 
$$
given by multiplication of $s$. Take the dual we have a map
$$
\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X.
$$
And the induced surjection
$$
\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow 0
$$
defines the section $s$. It seems a little bit weird that the projective compactification of $\mathcal{E}$ might be $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}^{\vee}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$ instead of $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}\oplus\mathcal{O}_X)$. Is there any explanation for this (if I am not completely talking about nonsense)? My guess is that it should have something to do with the fact I am considering projective bundle of hyperplanes. According to my previous experience, if some results involving projective bundle differs by a dual, it is caused by the two different conventions whether it is projective bundle of lines or hyperplanes.","['vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Note that there exist regular maps from the affine space onto the projective line, and more precisely a regular map $\mathbb{A}^1\to\mathbb{A}^2\smallsetminus\{0\}$ (namely $z\mapsto (z,z^2+1)$) whose composite with the quotient map $\mathbb{A}^2\smallsetminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{P}^1$ is surjective, see the MathSE question ""Does there exist a regular map $\mathbb{A}^1\to\mathbb{P}^1$ which is surjective?""

2042293,Zero subscheme of a section: Making computations.,"In the Algebraic Geometry course I am following we have defined vector bundles in the following way: Given a locally free sheaf $\mathscr{E}$ on a scheme $S$ we can define a functor, $$\mathbb{V}(\mathscr{E}): \operatorname{Sch}/S \to \operatorname{Set}$$ $$(Y \xrightarrow{f} S) \mapsto f^{*}\mathscr{E}(Y)$$
The vector bundle over $S$ associated to $\mathscr{E}$ will be the representing object of this functor $\vert \mathscr{E} \vert \xrightarrow{\pi} S$. I had to show that for every $s \in \mathscr{E}(S)$ we can find a closed subscheme of $S$, $V(s)$ such that a morphism $Y \xrightarrow{f} S$ factorizes through $V(s)$ if and only if $f^{*}(s)=0$. To do this I tried to define the ""vanishing set"" of the section using the set of points where the ""coordinates"" of $s$ lie in the maximal ideal but I had problems to finish the proof. However we can give a more geometrical interpretation: $\mathbb{V}(\mathscr{E})(X \xrightarrow{id} X)=\mathscr{E}(X)$ therefore we can identify global sections of the sheaf with global sections of the bundle. Now we note that $f^{*}\mathscr{E}$ is also locally free therefore it defines a bundle $\vert f^{*}\mathscr{E} \vert \xrightarrow{\pi'} Y$ and this bundle is the pullback of $\pi$ and $f$. The composition $s \circ f$ yields a section as pictured below Now the condition $f^{*}(s)=0$ translates to the fact that the associated section we have constructed equals to the zero section of $\vert f^{*} \mathscr{E}\vert$. Let us denote the zero sections of both spaces by $0_S,0_Y$. If we define $V(s)$ as the pullback of $s,0_S$ we obtain the desired subspace and the factorization property is encoded in the universal property of the pullback. Furthermore this subscheme is unique. This seems very nice theoretically but not very useful in practice. For the second part of the question I have to show that the Segre embedding of $\mathbb{P}^1_R \times_R \mathbb{P}^1_R \to \mathbb{P}^3_R$ arises as a vanishing as some $V(s)$.I know that it should be the vanishing locus of some homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 so I should be looking at $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^3_R}(2)$ as a vector bundle. However with the tools that I have I don't see how I could possible translate the previous disgression into some actual computations because I don't know how to turn a global section of the sheaf into a geometrical section. I know that morphisms into $ X \to \mathbb{P}^3_R$ are given by surjections $\mathcal{O}_X^4 \to \mathscr{L}$ with $\mathscr{L}$ an invertible sheaf.

2042363,Compatible germs and the espace étalé,"The following is a confusion I'm having that I cannot find answers to anywhere. If this question has already been asked, I apologise, but I couldn't find any answers after some pretty extensive searching. I know this is four questions, but I think really it's just one (i.e. how do I understand these two concepts in light of each other). After starting to read Vakil's The Rising Sea (which is fantastic, by the way), I have one big confusion. There is the concept of compatible germs and also the concept of the étalé space . They seem very linked, but I can't quite pin down how. Edit: question. In the comments and answers there has been plenty of help with the first and last question, so it's really just the two questions in bold that I'm left with now :) Here's what I've come up with after thinking about this some more, as a more concrete version of the remaining questions (hopefully): we know that taking sections of $p\colon\sqcup_{x\in X}\mathcal{F}_x\to X$ gives us the sheafification of $\mathcal{F}$, as does taking compatible germs. So is there an association between compatible germs and sections $\sigma$ of $p$, e.g. a bijection between the two? Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf (of sets) on a topological space $X$, and $U$ an open set of $X$.
Here are some facts/definitions (largely from Vakil's The Rising Sea ): The natural map $\varphi\colon\mathcal{F}(U)\to\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}_x$ is injective. An element $(s_x)_{x\in U}\in\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}_x$ is a collection of compatible germs if any of the following equivalent properties hold: for all $x\in U$ there exists a neighbourhood $U_x\subset U$ and a section $f\in\mathcal{F}(U_x)$ such that for all $y\in U$ we have $s_y=f_y$ (where $f_y$ is the germ of $f$ at $y$); $(s_x)_{x\in U}$ is the image of a section $f$ under the map $\varphi$ (i.e. the above condition holds but with $U_x=U$ for all $x$). The espace étalé $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$ associated to $\mathcal{F}$ (or more generally any pre sheaf) is constructed as follows: as a set, $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})=\coprod_{x\in X}\mathcal{F}_x$; as a topological space, the basis for the open sets of $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$ is given by the $\{V_{U,\,f}\mid U\in\mathsf{Op}(X), f\in\mathcal{F}(U)\}$ where $V_{U,\,f}=(f_x)_{x\in U}$; as an étalé space, the local homeomorphism is given by projection, i.e. $p\colon\Lambda(\mathcal{F})\to X$ acts as $f_x\mapsto x$. The sheaf $\Gamma(p\colon E\to X)$ associated to a continuous map $p\colon E\to X$ acts on open sets as follows: $\Gamma(p\colon E\to X)(U)=\{\sigma\colon U\to E \mid p\circ\sigma=\mathrm{id}_U\}$. Sheafification, which can be constructed by taking only compatible germs, is just $\Gamma\Lambda$. (The last fact is emphasised because it seems to me like it should be the thing that ties everything together.) Questions: Is all of the above correct? How can we think of compatible germs in terms of the étalé space of a (pre)sheaf? I am almost certain that I have read somewhere it is equivalent to the continuity of the sections $\sigma$ or something similar, but I can't find this anywhere. It seems like a collection of germs is compatible if and only if it is open in $\Lambda(\mathcal{F})$, but this doesn't sound right to me (or at least not the whole picture), especially when you ask... ... why does the germ map $\varphi$ use the product of sets while the étalé space uses the coproduct? Does this mean we can't link the two concepts? Is there a less confusing notation for elements of $\prod_{x\in U}\mathcal{F}(U)$? Writing $(s_x)_{x\in U}$ always looks to me like we take one section $s$ and look at all of its germs (i.e. compatibility!), but writing something like $(s_x^{(x)})_{x\in U}$ (trying to emphasise that the section that we take the germ of varies with the point we're taking the germ at) seems quite cumbersome (and also something I've never seen!).","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

sufficient statistic and $W(X)$ is an unbiased

My way: W.L.O.G., assume that $X\setminus U_0\neq\emptyset$ . Since $X$ is a projective variety, then $K(X)\cong S(X)_{(0)}$ , which implies that $K(X)=k(x_1/x_0,\dots,x_n/x_0)$ . Since $\dim X=r$ , by Theorem 4.8A and Theorem 4.7A on page 27 in Hartshorne, then W.L.O.G., we can assume that $x_1/x_0,\dots,x_r/x_0$ is a separating transcendence base for $K(X)$ over $k$ , which implies that $x_{r+1}/x_0,\dots,x_{n}/x_0$ are separable over $k(x_1/x_0,\dots,x_r/x_0)$ . By Theorem 4.6A on page 27 in Hartshorne, $K(X)=k(x_1/x_0,\dots,x_r/x_0)[y]$ , where $y$ is a $k(x_1/x_0,\dots,x_r/x_0)$ -linear combination of $x_{r+1}/x_0,\dots,x_n/x_0$ . Now I do not how to continue.",['algebraic-geometry']
2042676,Definition of ' blow up time' in the context of PDE,"$$ \partial_t u - x \partial_x u = -u^2$$ $$ u(x,0) = u_0 (x)$$ (i) Find the blow up time $t_*$ for the cauchy data $u_0(x) = cosx $ and determine the position $x(t_*)$ which the solution develops poles. Found a solution for this PDE using method of characteristics, but never heard the term ' blow up time ' ever for the context of PDE. Seems like it has something to do with solution going infinity but not sure. Any help how to solve this problem??","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

2042698,The Three-Cornered Duel,"I am analyzing the following problem from the the book ""Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solution"" by Frederick Mosteller. It seems to me that the solution to the The Three-Cornered Duel Problem presented in the book is incomplete. Can anybody confirm if my calculation is ok? The problem A, B and C are to fight a three-cornered pistol duel. All know that
  A's chance of hitting his target is 0.3, C's is 0.5, and B never
  misses. They are to fire at their choice of target in succession in
  the order A, B, C, cyclically (but a hit man loses further turns and
  is no longer shot at) until only one man is left unit. What should A's
  strategy be? Mosteller's solution: A is naturally not feeling cheery about this enterprise. Having the
  first shot he sees that, if he hits C, B will then surely hit him, and
  so he is not going to shoot at C. If he shoots at B and misses him,
  then B clearly shoots the more dangerous C first, and A gets one shot
  at B with probability 0.3 of succeeding. If he misses this time, the
  less said the better. On the other hand, suppose A hits B.  Then C and
  A shoot alternately until one hits. A's chance of winning is
  $$(.5)(.3)+(.5)^2(.7)(.3)+(.5)^3(.7)^2(.3)+…$$
  Each term corresponds to a sequence of misses by both C and A ending with a final hit by A. Summing the geometric series we get
  $$(.5)(.3)+\{1+(.5)(.7)+[(.5)(.7)]^2+… \}= \frac{(.5)(.3)}{1-(.5)(.7)}= \frac{0.15}{0.65}= \frac{3}{13} < \frac{3}{10}$$ 
  Thus hitting B and finishing off with C has less
  probability of winning for A than just missing the first shot. So A
  fires his first shot into the ground and then tries to hit B with his
  next shot. C is out of luck. My calculation case 1
$$P(A survives \ in \ case \ A \ shots \  B )= \mathbf{0.3} [(.5)(.3)+(.5)^2(.7)(.3)+(.5)^3(.7)^2(.3)+…] = \mathbf{0.3} \frac{(.5)(.3)}{1-(.5)(.7)}= \frac{\mathbf{0.3}(0.15)}{0.65}=0.069$$
case 2
$$P(A \ survives \ in \ case \ A \ misses \ the \ shot \ at \  B )= (0.7) \ 1 \ (0.3) = 0.21$$ Probability of survival is higher in case 2 therefore A should miss the first shot at B. Is my calculation correct?","['game-theory', 'probability']"
