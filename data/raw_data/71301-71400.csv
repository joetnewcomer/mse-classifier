872984,Sequences length for LFSR when polynomial is reducible,"An LFSR with polynomial $1+x^4+x^5 = (1+x+x^2)(1+x+x^3)$ can generate several sequences, depending on the initial value. If I did not make any mistake enumerating them, the length of the sequences are 3, 7, and 21. For $1+x+x^4+x^6 = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)(1+x+x^3)$ , I get 1, 3, 3, 7, 7, 21, 21 For $1+x+x^6+x^8+x^9 = (1+x+x^2)(1+x+x^3)(1+x+x^4)$ , I get 3, 7, 15, 15, 15, 15, 21, 105, 105, 105, 105 My goal is to have an algorithm to compute those length without going through the enumeration of all sequences. I am a bit puzzled by the fact that in the last example $45=3\cdot 15$ is not on the list. A link to a paper or a book dealing with that would be a great help: a lot of books cover LFSRs but most of the time they cover only maximum length cases...","['finite-fields', 'linear-algebra']"
873030,Uniform continuity of the function $x(t)=e^{tA}x$,"Let $A$ be a bounded operator on a Banach space $X$. Consider the exponential function $x(t)=e^{tA}x:=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\dfrac{t^nA^n}{n!}x$, for all $t\in \mathbb{R}$, where $x\in X$. If the function $t\mapsto x(t)=e^{tA}x$ is bounded in $\mathbb{R}$ then it is uniformly continuous. In fact $x(t)$ is a solution of the ordinary differential equation
$$x'(t)=Ax(t).$$
It follows that 
$$x(t)=x(0)+\int_0^tAx(u)du.$$
Then $$\left|x(t)-x(s) \right|=\left|\int_s^tAx(u)du\right|\leq  \left|A\right| \left|x\right|_\infty \left|t-s\right|.$$ So $x(t)$ is even Lipshitz. We can visualize this intuitively in the case $X=\mathbb{R}$, the function $x(t)=e^{ta}x$ is bounded if and only if $a$ is pure imaginary, so $x(t)$ has the form $\cos(\omega t)+i\sin(\omega t)$ which is uniformly continuous. My question concerns the case when $A$ is an unbounded operator which generates a strongly continuous group of operators $(T(t))_{t\in \mathbb{R}}$. We consider now the function $x(t)=T(t)x$. I tried to do the same manipulations as the function $t\mapsto e^{tA}x$. From some properties of strongly continuous groups we have $\int_0^tT(u)xdu\in D(A)$ for all $x\in X$, where $D(A)$ is the domain of $A$. In addition
$$x(t)=T(t)x=x+A\int_0^tT(u)xdu=x+A\int_0^tx(u)du$$
Using this I tried
$$\left|x(t)-x(s) \right|=\left|A\int_s^tx(u)du\right|.$$
But I stopped here since $A$ is not bounded.
So my question is what can we say in this case ? is $x(t)=T(t)x$ uniformly continuous if it is bounded on $\mathbb{R}$ ?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'semigroup-of-operators', 'functional-analysis']"
873032,What kind of points are there in a finite type $k$-scheme?,"Let $k$ be an arbitrary field and $X$ a $k$-scheme of finite type (i.e. a scheme with a finite cover of spectra of finitely generated $k$-algebras). How can I think of the points $x\in X$? What does it mean intuitively for a point to be open, closed, or neither of both? What is a characterization of the points $x\in X$? I think I found out a characterization of closed points. Please correct me, if there is something wrong. The closed points $x\in X$ can be characterized as for the special case $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ exactly the maximal ideals of $A$, the $x\in X$ for which the canonical morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(k(x))\to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\to X$ is a closed immersion. the $x\in X$ for which $k(x)$ is a finite field extension of $k$ (Zariki's Lemma). My question is also about the open points $x\in X$ and the points which are neither closed nor open. I guess that a point $x\in X$ is open iff $\operatorname{Spec}(k(x))\to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})\to X$ is an open immersion. Of course, if $X=\operatorname{Spec(A)}$ is affine, the open points $x\in X$ should be the complements of $V(I)$ containing one element for some ideal $I\subseteq A$. Do non-closed points correspond to certain subschemes of $X$ which are in a certain sense more that zero-dimensional? If yes, what does the (transcendence) degree of the field extension $k(x)/k$ say about the point $x$ and the subscheme? How is it reflected in the subvariety if the point is open? Short: How can I think of non-closed points? I have the impression that $X$ may have at most one open point which is the (unique) generic point of $X$, if is exists, for example if $X$ is integral. Perhaps the neither closed nor open points $x\in X$ are (exactly?) the generic points of the irreducible closed subschemes of $X$ which are not $X$ itself?
What does the (transcendence) degree of the field extension $k(x)/k$ say about the point $x$? If my guess about the irreducible closed subschemes corresponding to the points was right, is this transcendence degree the Krull dimension of that subvariety?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry']"

873088,If $F[x]$ is a principal domain does $F$ have to be necessarily a field? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Let $R$ be a commutative ring. If $R[X]$ is a principal ideal domain, then $R$ is a field. [duplicate] (5 answers) Closed 3 years ago . If $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a principal ideal domain. Conversely, if $F[x]$ is a principal domain does $F$ have to be necessarily a field? My Thoughts: Suppose instead of $F$ , we take the set of polynomials $R[x]$ over a commutative ring $R$ with unity. Then, suppose $I$ is an ideal of $R[x]$ . Let $g(x) \in I$ such that $g(x)$ is the polynomial of the lowest degree in $I$ . Then: $ \langle g(x) \rangle \subseteq I .......... (1)$ Let $f(x) \in I$ . Then $f(x) = p(x)g(x) + r(x)~~|~~p(x),r(x) \in R[x], \deg r(x) < \deg g(x)$ Since, $I$ is an ideal $\implies f(x) - p(x)g(x) = r(x) \in I$ But, $g(x)$ is of the lowest degree in $I \implies r(x) = 0 \implies f(x) \in \langle g(x)  \rangle \implies I \subseteq \langle g(x)  \rangle ......(2)$ Then from $(1),(2) : I = \langle g(x) \rangle$ Does the Presence of zero divisors in $R[x]$ really make a difference? The only advantage I see is that if there are no zero divisors in $R[x]$ then $I=\{0\} \implies I= \langle 0  \rangle$ . But, every ideal contains the zero element. Why is there the condition of a field specifically given in textbooks for $F[x]$ to be a principal ideal domain? Thank you for your help.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

873435,Two definitions of functions,"In literature on logic and set theory, there seem to be two different definitions of functions, one more general than the other. First of all, a function $f\colon X\to Y$ consists of three element $(X, Y, f)$, where $f\subseteq X\times Y$ satisfies
$$\forall x\in X\quad\exists!y\in Y:(x,y)\in f.

\forall x\quad\exists!y:P(x,y).

(Of course, $P$ could have other free variables, but I don't notate them.) The last definition, which allows our functions to be defined on our entire universe of sets, is the one used, for instance, in the Axiom Schema of Replacement.

I think that, even though we can always guess from the context which definition we use, the two definitions have a significant difference, first of all in their general applicability. My question is: Do I understand everything correctly? And in this case, is there no terminology to distinguish between functions in the two senses described?

Then $B(0, 1- {1\over n})$ is an open cover of $Y$ that does not admit a finite subcover. The sequence defintion states that a set is compact iff every sequence has a convergent subsequence. Therefore, to prove that $Y$ is not compact one must find a sequence that does not admit a convergent subsequence. I tried and failed. Then I looked for a solution and found this: let $f_n (x) = x^n$. I do understand that $f_n \in Y$. But it seems that these functions only converge pointwise because the limit function is discontinuous. But for this proof one wants a sequence that converges uniformly to something not in $Y$, no? So this is not an answer.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

Then the following assertions are equivalent. The mapping $f$ is differentiable at $a$. There exists an operator-valued mapping $\phi = \phi_a: U \to \operatorname{Lin}(\Bbb R^n, \Bbb R^p)$ continuous at $a$, such that $$f(x) = f(a) + \phi_a(x)(x-a).$$ If one of these conditions is satisfied we have $\phi_a(a) = Df(a)$. I'm struggling with implication $2 \Longrightarrow 1$. The book claims it is straightforward using a lemma that says that for an operator $A$ we have $\| A h \| \leq \| A \| \| h \|$, it's the Euclidean norm. I think I've solved it as follows, and I would like to know if it's correct: If $f$ has the given representation then we have $$f(a+h) = f(a) + \phi_a(a+h) h$$ for all vectors $h=x-a$. Since $\phi_a(a+h) \in \operatorname{Lin}(\Bbb R^n, \Bbb R^p)$ then $\phi_a(a+h) = \phi_a(a) + \phi_a(h)$ and we have $$f(a+h) = f(a) + \phi_a(a)h + \phi_a(h)h.$$ We need to show now that $\epsilon_a(h) = \phi_a(h)h$ satisfies $$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\| \epsilon_a (h)\|}{\| h\|} = 0.$$ (This is an equivalent definition of differentiability presented in the book.)

Therefore, there are two solutions for $c=0$ and $c=1$. Since, $(c+r+2)(c+r+1)a_{r+2}+k(k+1)a_{r}-2(c+r)a_{r}-(c+r)(c+r-1)a_{r}=0$ general recurrence equation is as follows: $a_{r+2}=\frac{[(c+r-k)(c+r+k+1)]a_{r}}{(c+r+2)(c+r+1)}$ There is no problem so far. But my book gives the following answer for $c=0$: $y=a_{0}\left\{ 1-\frac{k(k+1)}{2}x^{2}+\frac{k(k-2)(k+1)(k+3)}{4!}x^{4}-.....\right\}$ This is only possible for $a_1=0$. But I can't see that. I will be very glad if anyone can show me why $a_1$ should be equal to zero when $c=0$. Answer: I solved both for $c=0$ and $c=1$ as @Semiclassical suggested. For $c=0$, $a_1$ is indeterminate because of the term: $c(c+1)a_1x^{c-1}$ (It can be any value). Therefore, the solution is: $u=a_{0}\left\{ 1-\frac{k(k+1)}{2!}x^{2}+\frac{k(k-2)(k+1)(k+3)}{4!}x^{4}-.....\right\} +a_{1}\left\{ x-\frac{(k-1)(k+2)}{3!}x^{3}+\frac{(k-3)(k-1)(k+2)(k+4)}{5!}x^{5}-.....\right\}$ For $c=1$, $a_1=0$ because of the term: $c(c+1)a_1x^{c-1}$, thus the solution is: $w=a_{0}\left\{ x-\frac{(k-1)(k+2)}{3!}x^{3}+\frac{(k-3)(k-1)(k+2)(k+4)}{5!}x^{5}-.....\right\}$ As it is seen this is not a distinct solution. It is already available in the solution for $c=0$. Therefore, the solution for $c=0$ in my book is incomplete. Actually, it should give the complete solution as above.

I am also given the sequence of the sides (i.e. it is $abcd$ , not $abdc$ , or $acbd$ , or $acdb$ ,... etc). I know that Bretschneider's_formula $$
K=\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-a b c d \cdot \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{\alpha+\gamma}{2}\right)}
$$ (where $s=\frac{a+b+c+d}2$ is the semi-perimeter)
can give the area if the sum of either pair of opposite angles are known. But I do not know the angles of any of the vertices (interior or exterior). I can generate two quadrilateral equations by generating diagonal lines $e$ , $f$ and using the cosine rule of the triangle... $$  a^2 + b^2 - 2.a.b.\cos(\alpha)  (= e^2) =  c^2 + d^2 - 2.c.d.\cos(\gamma) $$ $$  b^2 + c^2 - 2.b.c.\cos(\beta)  (= f^2) =  a^2 + d^2 - 2.a.d.\cos(\delta) $$ These two equations have four unknowns (i.e. the interior angles: $\alpha$ , $\beta$ , $\gamma$ , $\delta$ ). $\delta$ is given by: $$ \delta = 360 - \alpha-\beta-\gamma $$ so this leave three unknowns but only two equations. Where do I go from here? ANSWER I have accepted Ted Shifrin's answer, if opposite angles sum to $\pi$ then we can use a simplified form of Bretschneider's formula to get the (maximum) area K. $$ K^2 = [(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)] $$ For finding the maximum area we dont need to know what any of the four individual vertex angles actually are. NOTES Ted indicates that it can be proved that a quadrilateral with opposite angles summing to $\pi$ must be concyclic and vice-versa.  It is straightforward to prove that, in a concyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary, by drawing diagonals and using the rule that the angle subtended by a chord at the centre is twice the angle subtended at the perimeter. Related question:- geometric-argument-as-to-why-the-cyclic-quadrilateral-has-the-maximal-area This paper (PDF) by Thomas Peter (2003):- Maximising the area of a quadrilateral gives a proof that:- ""For any quadrilateral with given edge lengths, there is a cyclic quadrilateral with the same edge lengths"".  It goes on to prove that:- ""The cyclic quadrilateral Q has the largest area of all quadrilaterals with sides of the same length as those of Q"". Also I deduce that any angle of a cyclic quadrilateral can be obtained from:- $$ cos(\alpha) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2)/(2(a.b +c.d)) $$ where $\alpha$ is the interior angle between sides a and b.

There is $f\in L^1(\partial \Omega)$ (which depends on $u$) such that $$\int_\Omega \varphi \Delta u=-\int_\Omega \nabla \varphi\nabla u+\int_{\partial\Omega}\varphi f,\ \forall\ \varphi\in C^\infty(\overline{\Omega})\tag{1}$$ We will denote this $f$ by $\frac{\partial  u}{\partial\eta}$ (note that when we have enough regularity, this is true in the classical sense). My question is: can we conclude that $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial \eta}<0,\ a.e.\ x\in \partial \Omega$$ Remark 1: I don't know if in this setting $f\in L^2(\partial\Omega)$.

873857,Question on calculating hypercohomology,"I want to compute the algebraic de Rham cohomology of $ \mathbb{C}^* $, and I'm confused. I don't have much background in this, so I was hoping a very concrete example would clear up a lot of this confusion. So far: We have this cochain of  $ \mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}]$-modules: $0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}\longrightarrow \mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}] \longrightarrow {\Omega}_{\mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}]/\mathbb{C}}^1 \longrightarrow 0$ where ${\Omega}_{\mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}]/\mathbb{C}}^1 = \mathbb{C}[x,x^{-1}] dx $.    (as i understand) As I understand, to obtain the de Rham cohomology we want a Cartan–Eilenberg resolution for this cochain, and then we want a left exact functor $F: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is our module category. Then we want to compute  the total cohomology of $F(I)$, where $I$ is our resolution. My issue seems to be actually doing this stuff, do I need to find $I,F$ explicitly?

873859,Rational analysis,"I found myself thinking about how much of real analysis that can also be developed within the rational numbers. Of course, $\Bbb Q$ is lacking what is perhaps the most important property of the real numbers, the Cauchy completeness (or, equivalently, the existence of the least upper bound). But still, it appears you could get quite far in $\Bbb Q$. First of all, elementary notions like continuity, limits and differentiability are easily definable (though even among the real functions that can be restricted to operators on $\Bbb Q$, not all of them will satisfy these definitions). Riemann integrability can also be defined in a limited form: In real analysis, the definition of the integral involves the supremum and the infimum. But we can define rational Riemann integrability if the upper and lower bounds in question do exist in $\Bbb Q$ and satisfy the appropriate relations, which will of course often be the case. But obviously, a function like $\Bbb Q\setminus\{0\}\ni x\mapsto 1/x$ is not integrable, since $\int_a^b \tfrac 1 x d x = \log(\tfrac b a)$ is not rational for unequal $a,b\in\Bbb Q$. But still, it seems we can get quite far. Does someone have an impression of how far we can get? Also, I have been totally unable to find any mention of rational analysis, as poor as it may be, in literature. Seeing that how far I could get, I find that strange. Does someone have an opinion about why this is the case.","['rational-numbers', 'analysis']"

$$T(n,1) = 1$$
$$\text{If}\; n\geq k \; \text{then} \; T(n,k) = x \sum _{i=1}^{n-1} T(n-i,k-1)+y \sum _{i=1}^{n-1} T(n-i,k) \; \text{else} \; T(n,k) = 0$$ when $x=1$ and $y=-1$ The row sums of the table $T$ when $x=1$ appears to be: $$A_T(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n} T(n,k) = \lim_{s\to y+1} \, \frac{(s+1)^{n-1}+s-1}{s}$$ as a function of $y$.

$$t(n,1) = 1$$

Otherwise the same kind of recurrence. Proof given by Jeffrey Shallit via email: OK, now I see. You wrote ""k"" before when you talked about the k 
  previous terms, and you
  really meant ""k-1"" previous terms. Just to let you know: you should have written t(n,k) = (sum from i = 1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k-1)) - (sum from i = 1 to k-1 
  of t(n-i,k)) Here's the proof. Now (sum from i=1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k-1)) is just the number of elements in
  {n-k+1,...,n-1) that are divisible by k-1. This is always equal to 1, 
  because in k-1 consecutive
  integers, exactly one will be divisible by k-1. On the other hand, (sum from i = 1 to k-1 of t(n-i,k)) is equal to 
  either 0 or 1, because in
  k-1 consecutive integers, either 0 or 1 of them are divisible by k. 
  We get 1 except if
  all are not divisible by k, which means the next integer /is/ divisible 
  by k, and the next integer is n. What I have found experimentally is a relationship between; $$A_T(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n} T(n,k)$$ and; $$a_t(n) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=n} t(n,k)$$ when; $x \geq 1$ $y \geq 0$ or; $x \leq -2$ $y \leq -2$ $$a_t(n) \;\; \sim \;\; \frac{A_T(n)}{c}$$ where: $$c = \left(\prod _{n=2}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{A_T(n)}}\right)$$ Put together: $$a_t(n) \;\; \sim \;\; \frac{A_T(n)}{\left(\prod _{n=2}^{\text{nn}} \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{A_T(n)}}\right)}$$ Works also for $x$ and $y$ as some complex numbers but I have not studied for what ranges of complex number it is valid. Taking the difference between the left hand side ($a_t(n)$) and the right side (the approximation $\frac{A_T(n)}{c}$) I have found, and this is the question: Is the ratio between the consecutive terms: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{a_t(n)-\frac{A_T(n)}{c}}{a_t(n-1)-\frac{A_T(n-1)}{c}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left((y+1)+\sqrt{(y+1)^2+4}\right)$$ when $y \geq 1$ and $x=1$?

873947,The bird pointer problem: finding the angle of rotation,"Suppose we have a bird pointer. He is a guy that likes to point at birds in the sky: His legs cannot move, however he can rotate around his torso. Also, his body and his arm always make a right angle. Here's a simplified diagram of the problem at hand: The problem is, given his torso location $(x_1, y_1)$, body height $h$, and bird location $(x_2, y_2)$, how much should he rotate? The amount of rotation is notated as $t$ in the following diagram (positive is counter clockwise): If the angle between his arm and body is 90 degrees, then the angle between his arm and the x axis is the same as the amount of rotation, which is $t$. Therefore we know that $\tan{t} = \frac{y_2-y_3}{x_2-x_3}$. We also know that $x_3 = x_1 - h \sin{t}$ and also $y_3 = y_1 + h \cos{t}$ Putting them all together $\tan{t} = \frac{y_2 - (y_1 + h \cos{t})}{x_2 - (x_1 - h \sin{t})}$ $\frac{\sin{t}}{\cos{t}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1 - h \cos{t}}{x_2 - x_1 + h \sin{t}}$ $(x_2 - x_1 + h \sin{t})\sin{t} = (y_2 - y_1 - h \cos{t})\cos{t}$ Let as denote $x_2 - x_1$ by $dx$ and $y_2 - y_1$ by $dy$. Note that both can be calculated from the problem so those are constants. Then the equation becomes $(dx + h \sin{t})\sin{t} = (dy - h \cos{t})\cos{t}$ $dx \sin{t} + h \sin^2{t} = dy \cos{t} - h \cos^2{t}$ $h \sin^2{t} + h \cos^2{t} = dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t}$ $h (\sin^2{t} + \cos^2{t}) = dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t}$ We then use the trigonometric identity $\sin^2{t} + \cos^2{t} = 1$ $dy \cos{t} - dx \sin{t} = h$ Therefore, I have reduced to problem to an equation of the form $A \cos{t} + B \sin{t} = C$ However, I have no idea on what to do next to solve for t.

In general, the sets where two measures agree does not seem to be a $\sigma$-algebra.
