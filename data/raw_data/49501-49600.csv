504731,Wrong use of function notation $f(n)$,"I've recently read in a book about computational complexity theory:
$$ O(f(n)) = \{g:\mathbb N \to\mathbb R \cup \{0\} : \exists \xi > 0,n_0\in \mathbb N\;\: g(n) \leq \xi \cdot f(n) \;\: \forall n \geq n_0 \} $$
But I think it should be $O(f)$ since the notation $f(n)$ denotes the image of $n$ under $f$. Is this correct? Thanks in advance. Edit : What is your opinion about $O(\log n)$? Should we consider $\log n: \mathbb N \to\mathbb R^+\cup\{0\}, n \mapsto \log(n)$?","['notation', 'functions']"
504739,Simple question about matrices,"My question is simple :

504741,Easy proof that $\exp{Xt} = I \Rightarrow X = 0$,"Let $X\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ and $I$ is identity matrix , than if:
  $$
\forall t\in \mathbb{R}\quad e^{Xt} = I
$$
  than
  $$
X = 0.
$$ I'm looking for short and slick proof of this statement. The only way I can think of to prove this is take Jordan normal form of $X = SJS^{-1}$. $J$ can be writen as $J = D+N$ where $D$ is diagonal and $N$ nillpotent(those ones on superdiagonal) and $DN = ND$ so $e^{D+N} = e^D e^N$. So we want to show that if $e^{(D+N)t} = I$ than $D=N=0$. Because $J$ is block diagonal we can work on those blocks separately. So we can assume that $D = \lambda I$ and $N$ is zero or has ones everywhere on superdiagonal. If I'm right than for nonzero $N$ we have
$$
(e^{Nt})_{ij} = \frac{t^{j-i}}{(j-i)!} \qquad i\leq j
$$
zero everywhere else. If $N$ is nonzero than:
$$
e^{(D+N)t}_{ij} = e^{\lambda t} \frac{t^{j-i}}{(j-i)!}  \qquad i\leq j
$$ So this would have to hold
$$
e^{\lambda t} \frac{t^{j-i}}{(j-i)!} = \delta_{ij} \qquad i\leq j
$$
That is not possible thus $N$ has to be zero. If $N$ is zero than we get $e^{\lambda t} = 1$. So $\lambda = 0$. I don't like this proof, there has to be simpler one.","['matrices', 'exponential-function', 'lie-algebras', 'lie-groups']"
504755,What is known about $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{I}^n)$,"A few months ago, I asked a related question: Is $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{I})$ isomorphic to $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{I}^2)$?

504766,Are the algebraic-valued points of a variety dense in complex-valued points?,"Let $X$ be a variety (integral scheme of finite type) over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. We may endow the sets $X(\overline{\mathbb Q})$ and $X(\mathbb C)$ of  $\overline{\mathbb Q}$- resp. $\mathbb C$-valued points of $X$ with the topologies induced by the topology on $\overline{\mathbb Q} \subset \mathbb C$. We have $X(\overline{\mathbb Q}) \subset X(\mathbb C)$. Q: Is $X(\overline{\mathbb Q})$ dense in  $X(\mathbb C)$? For a smooth $X$ I can show this. For $\dim X = 0$ this is also true. Ansatz :
The question is local on $X$, so we can assume that $X = \operatorname{Spec} A$, $A = \overline{\mathbb Q}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]/(f_1, \ldots, f_r)$ for polynomials $f_i$ in variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. So the question is, whether

My guess is that $f$ uniformly continuous in a neighborhood of $(a,s)$ for $c\leq s \leq d$ is a sufficient condition for the above equality to hold. This is my try for a proof of this: for $(t,s)$ in this neighborhood we may choose $\delta >0$ such that $\left |f(t,s)-f(a,s)  \right |< \frac{\epsilon}{d-c}$ whenever $\left |(t,s)-(a,s)  \right |< \delta$ .

Can any one give an example of a continous function for which the above doesn't hold.

Since $k^\times = U\times P$, where $U$ is the unit group of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and $P$ is the cyclic group generated multiplicatively by $p$ (thus $P\cong \mathbb{Z}$), $c$ can be written as $c(a)=\chi(a)|a|^s$, where $\chi$ is the character of $k^\times$ obtained by projecting to $U$ and then applying $c$'s restriction to $U$, and $s$ is the complex number determined (up to a multiple of $2\pi i/\log p$) by the equation $c(p)=1/p^s$.

Finally, define a ""local zeta-function"" that takes as parameters a function $f:k\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that is sufficiently integrable, and a quasi-character $c$ of $k^\times$, as follows: $$\zeta(f,c) = \int_{k^\times} f(a)c(a)|a|^{-1}d\mu(a)$$ (The $|a|^{-1}d\mu(a)$ is the Haar measure on $k^\times$.) The question: In this setting, Lang proves that for any two sufficiently integrable functions $f,g$, and any quasi-character $c$, the equation $$\zeta(f,c)\zeta(\hat g,\hat c) = \zeta(\hat f,\hat c)\zeta(g,c)$$ holds. This equation is eventually going to be used to prove the classical functional equation of the classical $\zeta$-functions. It is kind of a miraculous formula: it implies that the ratio $\zeta(f,c)/\zeta(\hat f,\hat c)$ is independent of the function $f$ and is actually just a function of $c$. Lang calls it $\rho(c)$. I follow the proof step-by-step but I am missing the forest for the trees. So my question is this: What is the ratio $\rho(c)=\zeta(f,c)/\zeta(\hat f,\hat c)$? What is it telling us about the quasi-character $c$? Why, morally, is it independent of $f$? Apologies that this question is not more precise. An example of a more precise question whose answer would advance my understanding of what I am going for here is Writing $c(a)=\chi(a)|a|^s$ for a character $\chi$ of $k^\times$ and fixing the character $\chi$ and the field $k=\mathbb{Q}_p$, $\rho$ becomes a complex function of a complex number. It ought to be some very nice function because its definition is made of such natural components. Is it? Once we are given $p,\chi$, can we write down $\rho(s)$ in terms of familiar functions like $\Gamma$, $\exp$, etc.?

505297,Mathematical induction - what makes it true?,"I am trying to work through an example in my book and it just seems nonsensical Why is mathematical induction a valid proof technique? The reason comes from the well ordering property, listed in Appendix 1, as an axiom for the set of positive integers, which
  states that ""every nonempty subset of the set of positive integers has a least element"". So, suppose
  we know that $P(1)$ is true and that the proposition $P(k)\to P(k + 1)$ is true for all positive
  integers $k$. To show that $P(n)$ must be true for all positive integers $n$, assume that there is at
  least one positive integer for which $P(n)$ is false. Then the set $S$ of positive integers for which
  $P(n)$ is false is nonempty. Thus, by the well-ordering property, $S$ has a least element, which
  will be denoted by m.We know that $m$ cannot be $1$, because $P(1)$ is true. Because $m$ is positive
  and greater than $1$, $m − 1$ is a positive integer. Furthermore, because $m − 1$ is less than $m$, it is
  not in $S$, so $P(m− 1)$ must be true. Because the conditional statement $P(m− 1)\to P(m)$ is
  also true, it must be the case that $P(m)$ is true. This contradicts the choice of $m$. Hence, $P(n)$
  must be true for every positive integer $n$."" I am getting confused at a lot of parts of this. So assuming that $P(1)$ is true and assuming that $P(k)$ implies $P(k+1)$ for all positive integers, why do I have to show that one positive integer is false to show that it must be true? I don't understand that. Anyways now my set S of $P(n)$ false inputs is now not empty. So that element is now $m$, and $m$ must be positive so then they claim $P(m-1)$ must be true because it is less than $m$. Why is this true? For example why can't I have $5$ and $4$ both being false where $m$ is $5$? Why does $P(m -1)$ imply $P(m)$? There doesn't seem to be proven anywhere. They then claim that $P(m)$ must now be true even though they previously claimed that it was false, so how can that be?

And it is a theorem that if the limit of $f(x,y)$ as $(x,y)$ goes to $(a,b)$ along $C$ exists and is the same for all continuous curves $C$ passing through $(a,b)$, then the (unqualified) limit of $f(x,y)$ as $(x,y)$ approaches $(a,b)$ also exists and is equal to the limit along all those curves. My question is, can we weaken those conditions?  In other words, is there some smaller class of curves passing through $(a,b)$ for which $f(x,y)$ having the same limit for them suffices to guarantee the existence of the limit?  We can't make restrict ourselves to just lines passing through $(a,b)$, as there exist examples of functions which have the same limit along all lines passing through a point, but a different limit along some parabola.  (For instance, $f(x,y) = \frac{x^2y}{x^4+y^2}$ for the point $(0,0)$ and the parabola $y=x^2$.)

(By a polynomial curve I mean either the graph of a polynomial function, or a curve obtained by rotating the graph of such a function about the point $ (a,b) $.) Assuming that I'm right about all that, what if we took the class of polynomial curves of all orders?

505328,Measurable structure on the space of probability measures,"My advisor only half-jokingly mentioned that sometimes people like to consider the measurable structure on $P(X)$ where X is a locally compact polish space and $P(.)$ denotes the probability measures with the topology of distributional convergence. (Which is the same as a weak * topology as seen through Riesz Representation.)  People then consider $P^n(X)$. I have also seen other sources defining the measurable structure on $P(X)$ not by referring to the topology and saying it's borel, but rather choosing the smallest $\sigma$ field so that all of the maps $\theta \mapsto \theta(A)$ as $A$ varies over the Borel subsets of $X$ are measurable.  My question is why this is equivalent to the description where you take the $\sigma$ field to be the Borel of the weak* topology, i.e. the topology with the notion of convergence $\theta_n \rightarrow \theta$ if and only if $\forall f$ bounded continuous on $X$ we have $\int f d\theta_n \rightarrow \int f d\theta$. (I am talking about this as if it's a weak * topology and using Riesz representation because this notion is equivalent to requiring it only for those $f$ which are vanishing at infinity.) If it is not true for $X$ as general as I've stated, then please explain why it is true for $\mathbb{R}=X$, if it is. Progress so far: Seeing that the borel description makes the family of maps $\theta \mapsto \theta(A)$ measurable, hence the borel description contains the other one.  This was done by seeing that $A$ can actually just range over open sets, and then approximating the indicator of open sets pointwise by continuous functions.  Also, I know that $P(X)$ is a compact metric space. EDIT: I should take back that I see that $P(X)$ is a compact metric space.  It is not one in general.

Take for example the question: Let $a,b,c,d$ be constants, and let $U=\left\{\left[\begin{array}{r}x\\y\\z\end{array}\right]\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\;\middle|\; ax+by+cz=d\right\}$. Show that $U$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if $d=0$. By the first test above, $\left[\begin{array}{r}0\\0\\0\end{array}\right]$ is not in $U$ if $d\neq 0$ because $a(0)+b(0)+c(0)$ necessarily implies that $d=0$... Consider also the line $x+y=1$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This also does not contain the zero vector. It seems to me like ""zero vector"" is being used synonymously with ""origin"", but this doesn't fit the definition of a vector that I was given. Sure, an arrow can begin at the origin and extend outward, but not necessarily. Any arrow representing a vector is the same as any other as long as it has the same length and direction, no matter where the base of the arrow sits, the zero vector should still be the zero vector. So I ask... How can the zero vector not be in any plane, if it is indeed properly understood as ""pick a point, move 0 units on the x-axis, 0 units on the y-axis, and 0 units on the z-axis""?",['linear-algebra']

This is #16 in the first section. Show the diagonal $\Delta$ of $X\times X$ is diffeomorphic to $X$. All sets are subsets of some Euclidean space. I define $\phi:X\to X\times X$ by $\phi(x)=(x,x)$. Clearly $\phi$ is a bijection of $X$ and $\Delta$. If $x\in X$, let $U_x$ be an open nbhd of $x$ in the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^k$. Define $F:U_x\to\mathbb{R}^{2k}$ by $F(x)=(x,x)$. I suspect $F$ is smooth. Notice if $y\in U_x$, 
$$
\begin{align*}
dF_y(z)&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{F(y+hz)-F(y)}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(y+hz,y+hz)-(y,y)}{h}\\
&=\lim_{h\to 0} (z,z)=F(z)
\end{align*}
$$
so $dF_y=F$. This implies $F$ is smooth. Since $F=\phi$ on $U_x\cap X$, $\phi$ is also smooth. Finally, $\phi^{-1}\colon\Delta\to X$ is just a projection map on the first coordinate, and I know projections are smooth. So $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism of $X$ and $\Delta$. Is this sensible?

505499,Integral approximation of Fourier series.,"Consider a function $f$ defined on the real line. Consider the restriction of the function to the interval $[-L,L]$ and periodically extend the function using a Fourier series
$$f_L(x) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(k_n)e^{ik_nx}$$
where $k_n=\pi n/L$ and where $\hat{f}(k_n)$ denotes the Fourier coefficient. For sufficiently large $L$, it seems plausible that we may approximate the Fourier series with an integral. In particular, let us extend $\hat{f}(k_n)$ to non-integral values through
$$\hat{f}(k)=\frac{1}{2L}\int_{-L}^L f_L(x)\,e^{-ikx}\ dx $$
and write the approximation as
$$\tilde{f}_L(x)=\frac{2L}{(2\pi)}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat{f}(k)\,e^{ikx}\ dk$$
To provide a bit of context, I first encountered such integral approximations when studying cosmology. It seems common in physics to take such approximations where we formally make the replacement
$$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \longrightarrow \frac{2L}{(2\pi)}\int_{-\infty}^\infty$$
in the limit of large $L$, which is called the continuum limit . My question is under what conditions is such an approximation valid?

I already figured out that I can express   $-\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x^2} - \frac{1}{x^3} - \frac{1}{x^4} - \cdots$   as negative exponents:   $-x^{-1} - x^{-2} - x^{-3} - x^{-4} - \cdots$   and then factor the $-1$'s  inside the exponents:   $-x^{-1\cdot1} - x^{-1\cdot2} - x^{-1\cdot3} - x^{-1\cdot4} - \cdots$   which can be seen as a power of a power:   $-(x^{-1})^1 - (x^{-1})^2 - (x^{-1})^3 - (x^{-1})^4 - \cdots$   and the minus sign can be factored out too:   $-\left[ (x^{-1})^1 + (x^{-1})^2 + (x^{-1})^3 + (x^{-1})^4 + \cdots \right]$   which almost gives me the form of the other series with raising positive exponents. But there's that dangling minus sign in front of it, and the 0 th power term is missing :-/ so I don't know how to massage it any further to get the other form of the expansion. Any ideas? Edit: I know about Taylor series expansions and I can expand  $\frac{1}{1-x}$   this way into   $1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots$   (I don't know how to get the other form this way, though). Also, I know about the convergence condition for the infinite series,   $|x| < 1$   in the case of the first answer, and   $|x| > 1$   or   $|\frac{1}{x}| < 1$   in the case of the second answer. I just didn't expect that this could matter in my case, when I just reorder the terms in the divisor, which shouldn't produce different answer. I suspected that this could be somehow related to the fact that raising powers of a fraction is the same as falling powers of its inverse. But I cannot figure out why just one of these or the other is given, depending on the order of terms in the long division, and this is what confuses me the most.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'polynomials']"

505847,Real Analysis Proofs: Additive Functions,"I'm new here and could really use some help please: Let $f$ be an additive function. So for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$, $f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)$. Prove that if there are $M>0$ and $a>0$ such that if $x \in [-a,a]$, then $|f(x)|\leq M$, then $f$ has a limit at every $x\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lim_{t\rightarrow x} f(t) = f(x)$. Prove that if $f$ has a limit at each $x\in \mathbb{R}$, then there are $M>0$ and $a>0$ such that if $x\in [-a,a]$, then $|f(x)| \leq M$. if necessary the proofs should involve the $\delta - \varepsilon$ definition of a limit. The problem had two previous portions to it that I already know how to do. However, you can reference them to do the posted portions of the problem. Here they are: (a) Show that for each positive integer $n$ and each real number $x$, $f(nx)=nf(x)$. (b) Suppose $f$ is such that there are $M>0$ and $a>0$ such that if $x\in [−a,a]$, then $|f(x)|\le M$. Choose $\varepsilon > 0$. There is a positive integer $N$ such that $M/N < \varepsilon$. Show that if $|x-y|<a/N$, then |$f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon$.","['real-analysis', 'functional-equations']"
505848,Does this sequence always give an integer?,"It is known that the $k$-Somos sequences always give integers for $2\le k\le 7$. For example, the $6$-Somos sequence is defined as the following : $$a_{n+6}=\frac{a_{n+5}\cdot a_{n+1}+a_{n+4}\cdot a_{n+2}+{a_{n+3}}^2}{a_n}\ \ (n\ge0)$$ where $a_0=a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=1$. Then, here is my question. Question : If a sequence $\{b_n\}$ is difined as 
$$b_{n+6}=\frac{b_{n+5}\cdot b_{n+1}+b_{n+4}\cdot b_{n+2}+{b_{n+3}}^2}{b_n}\ \ (n\ge0)$$$$b_0=b_1=b_2=b_3=1, b_4=b_5=2,$$
then is $b_n$ an integer for any $n$? We can see 
$$b_6=5,b_7=11,b_8=25,b_9=97,b_{10}=220,b_{11}=1396,b_{12}=6053,b_{13}=30467$$
$$b_{14}=249431,b_{15}=1381913,b_{16}=19850884,b_{17}=160799404$$
$$b_{18}=1942868797,b_{19}=36133524445, \cdots.$$ Motivation : I've been interested in seeing what happens when we change the first few terms. It seems true, but I can neither find any counterexample nor prove that the sequence always gives an integer. As far as I know, it seems that this question cannot be solved in the way which proved that the $6$-Somos sequence always gives an integer.

505857,"""Integration by parts"" in complex analysis","I'm reading a proof of the Cauchy formula for the derivatives of an holomorphic function from some lecture notes . The author first proves that
$$f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C}\frac{f^{(n)}(\zeta)}{\zeta-z}\;d\zeta$$
where $C$ is a circumference enclosing $z$. Then he says: ""... integrating this by parts $n$ times gives the required formula..."" 
I don't understand what he means with integrating by parts; this is a technique used in real analysis! In complex analysis, what is the integration by parts?
Practically from the above formula I have problems to get: $$f^{(n)}(z)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\int_{C}\frac{f(\zeta)}{{(\zeta-z)}^{n+1}}\;d\zeta$$ Thanks in advance.","['integration', 'complex-analysis']"
