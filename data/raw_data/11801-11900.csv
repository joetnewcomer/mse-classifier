91878,Countable/uncountable basis of vector space,"I've stumbled upon this exercise in algebra book, in chapter dealing with vector spaces' dimensions. Prove that basis of the field of real numbers $\mathbb R$ as vector
  space over the field of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$ is not countable. Book doesn't cover terms ""countable"" and ""uncountable"" and I'm not able to put web info about these topics into something useful for this exercise. updated: After receiving great answer by Asaf Karagila, which I unfortunately cannot fully comprehend, I've come with my own idea of proof. Let's count all real numbers in this situation. We have countable basis, and any vector of vector space $\mathbb R$ can have only finite subset of coefficients in it not equal to zero. We can pick different combination of finite coefficients which will not be equal to zero with countable number of ways (Asaf Karagila's fact III). So, already we have countable number of different ways to choose single vector. But more than that, in every choosen finite set of the coefficients every one of it will be different from vector to vector. Every coefficient can be one different value taken from countable $\mathbb Q$ set, and we have finite number of coefficients for any finite set choosen earlier. To sum up, we have countable number of ways to choose set of coefficients for any vector, and finite number of countable sequent ways to choose concrete values for each coefficient in basis representation of vector. We've got Cartesian product of   (finite + 1) = finite   countable sets, which is countable set again (property of countable set). So, we conclude that there are countable number of different real numbers, and that's wrong, so the basis of vector space $\mathbb R$ cannot be countable. I have very strong doubts about it though. Please correct me and point to unclear parts of it.","['linear-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
91886,surface area of torus of revolution,"Here's a question from one of my exercises, Exercise 14. Let $C$ be a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ given by parametric equations $x=f(t)$ , $y=g(t)$ . Let $S$ be the surface of revolution of the curve $C$ about the $y$ -axis (something like the one shown in Figure 1). (a) Parametrize the surface $S$ . Parameters are $t$ and $\theta$ , where $0\leq\theta\leq2\pi$ . (b) Apply part (a) to parametrize the torus of revolution (see Figure 2) obtained by rotating the circle of radius $b$ centered at $(a,0)$ about the $y$ -axis. (Assume $a>b$ here.) I've got part (a) and (b), but how should I go about finding the surface area of this torus? Here's my solution to first 2 parts: (a) Applying cylindrical coordinates, since rotation is about $y$ -axis, let $x= r \cos \theta$ , $y = y$ and $z = r \sin \theta$ , at $\theta=0$ we get $f(t) = r$ , hence the parameterization is: $$x = f(t) \cos \theta\quad y = g(t) \quad z = f(t) \sin \theta$$ for $a \leq t \leq b$ and $0 \leq\theta\leq 2\pi$ . (b) In the plane $x,y$ the circle is $x = a + b \cos \psi$ , $y = b \sin \psi$ . From part (a), we get the following parametrization for the torus: $$x = (a + b \cos \psi)\cos \theta, \quad y = b \sin \psi, \quad z = (a + b \cos \psi)\sin \theta$$ where $0\leq\psi,\theta\leq 2\pi$ .

91890,Best possible approximation by holomorphic functions,"Let $D$ denote the closed complex unit disk and let $f:D \rightarrow \mathbb C$ be any continuous function. Suppose we wish to approximate $f$ by a holomorphic function $g$ in the uniform metric: we seek to minimize $\sup\{z\in D : |g(z) - f(z)|\}$, subject to the condition that $g$ be holomorphic on the interior of the disk. The uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic, so this quantity cannot be zero if $f$ is not holomorphic. Is there any general result about how small it can be for some class of choices of $f$? In particular, how closely can we approximate the conjugate function $z \mapsto \bar z$ by a holomorphic function?",['complex-analysis']
91904,Are these two versions of the dominated convergence theorem equivalent?,"First version: This is from an old script of my professor: Let $f_n$ be a sequence of integrable functions. Let $f$ be a measurable function such that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(\omega) = f(\omega)$$
$P$-almost everywhere. Let $g\geq 0$ be a positive function with the property 
$$\int g\,dP<\infty$$
such that
$$|f_n(\omega)|\leq g(\omega)$$
$P$-almost everywhere.
Then $f$ is integrable and it is true that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\Omega f_n\,dP=\int_\Omega f\,dP$$ Second version: I read this one on Wikipedia : Let $f_n$ denote a sequence of real-valued measurable functions on a measure space $(\Omega ,\mathcal{A},P)$. Assume that the sequence converges pointwise to a function $f$ and is dominated by some integrable function $g$ in the sense that $|f_n(x)| \leq g(x)$ for all $x\in \Omega$. Then the limiting function $f$ is integrable and
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\Omega f_n\,dP=\int_\Omega f\,dP$$ The difference here is that $f_n$ are real-valued measurable functions (not integrable as in the version above). Are these versions still equivalent? Thanks for anyone who enlightens me.","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

91937,"What's the largest possible volume of a taco, and how do I make one that big?","Let $f$ be a continuous, even function over some interval $I=[-a,a]$ such that the total arc length of $f$ over $I$ is at least $2$ , $f(0)=0$ , and $f$ is increasing on $(0,a)$ .  [You might imagine something like $f(x)=x^2$ .] View the graph of $z=f(x)$ as a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (so, parallel to the $y$ -axis). Model a corn tortilla (or pita bread if you prefer) as a pliable disk of radius $1$ , place it in the $xy$ -plane with its center at the origin, and wrap the tortilla up against the surface $z=f(x)$ .

Question: Can we determine how to maximize $V$ with respect to all such functions $f$ ?  Because, you know, I want my taco to be the biggest. Elementary candidates for $f$ include a semicircle function, a parabola, an absolute value function, a cosine wave, etc.  But if there is a unique answer, it might not be an elementary curve at all. Edit: This probably shouldn't have been asked in a way that relies on a function $f$ .  Maybe the biggest taco has regions where the shell is curved completely vertical, and we no longer have the graph of a continuous function.  If you prefer, consider curves parametrized by arc length $$\left(X(t),0,Z(t)\right):[0,1]\to xz\mbox{-plane}$$ with $X(0)=Z(0)=0$ , and $X$ and $Z$ (not necessarily strictly) increasing.

Is this proof correct, and if so, what is the optimal constant? My proof. Consider all the $z_i$ with positive real part. Call the real part of the sum of these numbers $X^+$ . In a similar way, form $X^-$ , $Y^+$ , and $Y^-$ . Without loss of generality, let $X^+$ have the greatest magnitude of these.

Which reads to me, to mean a consensus of mathematicians agreed upon these principle values (I'm certain with some underlying reasoning, which I don't know of yet) to solve the issue of potential multiple results from a the same input to one of these functions. What I don't get Domain of arcsine & arccosine, why? When discussing the domain of ""x"" for these 3 functions, as shown in this table on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_function#Principal_values I see the domain of arcsine and arccosine is −1 ≤ x ≤ 1. I've watched a number of basic tutorials on the unit circle and how it can be used to help solve these functions. So of course, I can see and visualize the fact that the maximum and minimum values of X on the unit circle are 1 & -1. But I'm struggling to understand the intuition behind the restriction of the domain? My understanding right now is that the unit circle has x value [1;-1], so is that why the range is that? Domain of arctangent, why? Also the domain for arctangent is ""all real numbers"" - in the video on Khan Academy http://www.khanacademy.org/video/inverse-trig-functions--arctan?playlist=Trigonometry Sal (main teacher on Khan Academy) talks about how tangent of something also represents that slope of a line (I guess the hypotenuse) and how that could have infinite results.

Now, since $m(S)>0$, there exists a non-measurable subset $S'$ of $S$, and we can then write: $$S=S'\cup (S\setminus S').$$ How would we then go about dealing with this (sorry, I don't know how to Tex an integral) $$\int_S f\,d\mu=\int_{S'} f\,d\mu+ \int_{S\setminus S'}f\,d\mu?$$ (given that $S'$ and $S\setminus S'$ are clearly disjoint) Doesn't this imply that the integral over the non-measurable subset S' can be defined? It also seems , using inner- and outer- measure, that if $S'$ is non-measurable, i.e. $m^*<m_*$, neither is $S\setminus S'$. So I'm confused here. Thanks for any comments. Edit: what confuses me here is this: We start with a set equality $A=B$  (given as $S=S'\cup (S-S')$, so that $A=S$, $B=S-S'$, from which we cannot conclude: $\int_A f=\int_B f$ , it is as if we had $x=y+z$ , but we cannot then conclude, for any decomposition of $x$, that $f(x)=f(y+z)$.",['measure-theory']

In this way the certain diffeomorphism can be defined without problem. Amazingly enough, with the same conditions in the first paragraph, ${f^{ - 1}}(0)$ and ${f^{ - 1}}(1)$ seem to be still diffeomorphic.

92075,"Sylow 2-subgroup of GL(2,R)","I was trying to work out the Sylow p -subgroups for general linear groups over arbitrary fields, and was running into some trouble with non-algebraically closed fields.  The real numbers, R , were particularly troubling: Does the group GL(2, R ) of 2×2 invertible matrices with real entries have a single conjugacy class of maximal 2-subgroups? The specific thing that bothers me is that every 2 n th root of unity has a quadratic minimal polynomial over R , and so we get cyclic 2-subgroups of arbitrary (finite) size, but I'm not sure I understand how to write down the elements of the union of this subgroup, and so I am not sure what its normalizer looks like. Is there a description of this subgroup that allows one to determine if any particular matrix is contained in it? In particular, I can write the subgroup down as a direct limit of reasonably explicit matrix groups, but the maps are not the standards inclusions, and so I cannot easily describe the limit as an actual union. Using trig identities we can write down a recursive formula for the minimal polynomial of the 2 n th root of unity over R , and then the rational canonical form gives a generator for a cyclic group of order 2 n .  A generator for 2 n is mapped to the 2 m th power of the 2 n + m generator, which for m = 1 (the only map a sane person cares about) is easy to write down explicitly.  However, as a whole the direct limit seems quite inexplicit, since no particular matrix is ever actually in the direct limit, only a conjugate of it by an infinite sequence of change of bases. I would like to give fairly constructive descriptions of the Sylow subgroups, and in particular, would like an algorithm that, for an arbitrary p -subgroup, finds a conjugator into a ""standard"" copy of the Sylow p -subgroup.

92132,Create parallel line and find intersection with other line,"I'm trying to create parallel lines of the bold, black lines in this picture: It is just an arbitrary (convex) quadrilateral, with the blue corner points known. The bold, black lines start at 25% of each blue line and end at 75%. So, say $\lambda_1 = 0.25$ and $\lambda_2 = 0.75$, then $$\begin{align}
Start = \lambda_1 \cdot c_2 + (1-\lambda_1) \cdot c_1 \\
End = \lambda_2 \cdot c_2 + (1-\lambda_2) \cdot c_1
\end{align}$$ Where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the two points of a blue line. Now my actual questions. 1.) How to create a parallel line to such a bold black line? It should have the same length, and be guided along the dashed green line towards the centroid. If I'm not mistaken, the centroid is at the intersection of the two bimedians (the dashed green lines). Since it is a quadrilateral, this should be the same as the mean value of the 4 points at the corners. Therefore, the centroid is known as well. 2.) Ok, so say I got the parallel lines. Then I move them all towards the centroid, until their endpoints touch, creating a scaled-down version of this quadrilateral. Is there a way to obtain the coordinates of these 4 new corner points in general? By the way, I did a search and came up with this topic , but there it is guided along the perpendicular line, and my green dashed lines are not perpendicular to the blue/black ones. Edit : The equation for a dashed green line from the center of the blue line towards the centroid would be $$\begin{align}
\lambda \cdot C + (1 - \lambda) \cdot \left( \frac{c_1+c_2}{2} \right)
\end{align}$$ Where $C$ is the centroid. The equation for a bimedian would be $$\begin{align}
\gamma \cdot \left( \frac{c_3+c_4}{2} \right) + (1 - \gamma) \cdot \left( \frac{c_1+c_2}{2} \right)
\end{align}$$ So somehow, the $Start$ and $End$ points must be moved in the direction of one of these lines above, in order to create a $NewStart$ and $NewEnd$ point. Then the equation for the parallel line would simply be $$\begin{align}
\eta \cdot NewEnd + (1-\eta) \cdot NewStart

92232,Reason behind the reciprocity of series,"This question may appear to be a silly one for experts. From long back I have been observing all kinds of series but every-series contain a reciprocal part, I mean the "" one over something "" , is there any interesting reason for it ? . In general if we consider the Dirichlet's L-series its given by $$L(s,\chi)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{\large \chi (n)}{\large n^s}$$ , so I know that its a generalization of Riemann Zeta function, and also know that these series are useful in proving the theorem of primes in arithmetic progression. But I observed that every such "" series "" contain the reciprocal term ( I was referring to $\large \frac{1}{n^s}$ ) . As far as I know the Dirichlet theorem for arithmetic progression of primes implies that $\large \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{11}+.........$ is a divergent series, but I was wondering that $\large 3+7+11+......$ is also a divergent series and still diverge faster than the former one. So why is the reason of using the "" one over term in the series "", like why cant the series be stated as $$L(s,\chi)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\large \chi (n)\large n^s$$ instead of $$L(s,\chi)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{\large \chi (n)}{\large n^s}.$$ What is the significance of such reciprocal term ? And also if one takes the Hasse-weil L-function of a curve its defined as 
$$L_p(s)= 1/P(\large p^{-s})$$ where $P(T)=\begin{cases} \large1-a_pT+pT^2 & \text{ If its good reduction } , 
\\ 1-T & \text{If reduction is split multiplicative } , \\ 1+T & \text { If reduction is non-split multiplicative },\\1 & \text{ If its additive } .\end{cases}$ Here also we can notice that we took a reciprocal of the term $P(\large p^{-s})$ instead of directly writing it. And actual $L$-function is $L(s,E)=\prod_p L_p(s)$. So finally to put it in short why does one always encounters these reciprocals when talking about series and other functions in Analytical Number Theory ? And also I heard that Hasse-Weil L-function carries the information about local points, so there must be some interesting reason behind considering the reciprocals when one fabricate any such functions. If the answer is "" Its a result of random attempt like one needs to take sum of reciprocals to obtain something then please explain me the use of taking reciprocals "" Thanks a lot.","['power-series', 'special-functions', 'sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

92287,A Proof of Correctness of Durstenfeld's Random Permutation Algorithm,"Question : Does anyone have a precise mathematical proof of Durstenfeld's Algorithm ? The first $O(n)$ shuffle or random permutation generator was published by Richard Durstenfeld in 1964. This algorithm came to the notice of programmers because it was included in Knuth 1969, page 125, 2 , as Algorithm P . A succinct statement of the algorithm is:
\begin{equation}
\text{for  }\ k \leftarrow n,n-1,\ldots,2\ \text{ do }
\begin{cases}
\text{Choose at random a number}\ \ r \in [1,k] \\\ \text{Interchange }\pi[r] \text{ and }\pi[k],\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\pi[1 \ldots n]$ is the array to be shuffled or randomly permuted. This is a truly elegant algorithm, computationally and mathematically. Computationally it handles set operations by dividing the array $\pi$ into an unshuffled set $\pi[1,\ldots, k]$, and a shuffled set $\pi[k+1,\ldots, n]$. At each iteration $k$, it chooses a random element $\pi[r]$ from the unshuffled set  $\pi[1,\ldots, k]$, and interchanges it with $\pi[k]$. This moves $\pi[r]$ into the new shuffled set $\pi[k,\ldots, n]$, where it remains, unmoved, for all subsequent iterations. This is done in $O(1)$ time and space. Thus, the time and space complexity of Durstenfeld's algorithm is $O(n)$, which is optimal. Mathematically, the algorithm is elegant because it implicitly uses the well-known lemma that every permutation $\pi$ is a product of transpositions. At each iteration $k$, the algorithm chooses a random number $r_k \in [1,\ldots,k]$ and performs a transposition $(\pi[k], \pi[r_k])$. Thus the random permutation produced can be written as $$
\pi = (\pi[n],\pi[r_n])(\pi[n-1],\pi[r_{n-1}]) \cdots (\pi[k],\pi[r_k])\cdots (\pi[2],\pi[r_2]),
$$ where $(\pi[k],\pi[r_k])$ is the transposition or interchange of $\pi[k]$ and $\pi[r_k]$. Matlab Implementation of Durstenfeld's Algorithm function p = GRPdurG(p)

%  GRPdurG A Combinatorial Conundrum A random permutation of the integers $\{1,2, \ldots,10^7\}$ can be generated in a few seconds using the Durstenfeld Shuffle algorithm on a standard PC. The combinatorial space $\mathcal{C}$ in this case is set of all permutations of  size $10^7$. The size of this sample space is
\begin{equation*}
|\mathcal{C}| = n! = (10^7)! \approx 10^{65,657,059}
\end{equation*}
This is a gigantic number and very far beyond limits of any known random number generator. That is, $|\mathcal{C}| \ggg |\mathcal{G}|$, the state space of the random number generator. For example, the period (size of state space) of the well-known Mersenne Twister RNG (MT) is about $10^{6000}$. Hence random permutation generators using MT must miss nearly all permutations in this space. None-the-less, the Matlab function above produces random permutations of length $10^7$ in the correct statistical proportions, e.g, $1/e$  are derangements, $1/n$ are cycles, etc., yet it must miss most of the possible permutations. Hence the conundrum. The most important question to me is: Do random permutation generators sample uniformly from the space of permutations ? assuming they use the best random number generator available. I suspect that this is a difficult mathematical problem. See this Matlab discussion: What Does RANDPERM Miss?

and I can certainly see why the function repeats itself every $2 \pi$ radians, 
using the unit circle definition. What I don't understand is why it has this exact shape, why does it look like it does between 0 and 0.5 Pi, why does it have this exact concavity?

$\cos b=\displaystyle{\sqrt3 \over k}$ and $\sin b=\displaystyle{1\over k}$. The answer from there is fairly simple to get which is $k=2$ and $b=\displaystyle{\pi\over6}$.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph, and let $0=\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots\leq \lambda_n $ be the eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix. Then, $\lambda_2 >0 $ if and only if $G$ is connected. Proof: We first show that $\lambda_{2}=0$  if $G$ is disconnected. If $G$ is disconnected, then it can be described as the union of two graphs, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. After suitably re-numbering the vertices, we can write $$L_{G}=\begin{bmatrix}
L_{G_{1}}  & 0\\
0  &  L_{G_{2}}
\end{bmatrix}.$$ So, $L_{G}$ has at least two orthogonal eigenvectors of eigenvalue zero: $$\begin{bmatrix}
0\\ 
1
\end{bmatrix}
\mbox{ and } 
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}$$ where we have partitioned the vectors as we did the matrix $L_{G}$. What does it mean ""orthogonal eigenvectors of eigenvalue zero""? Are those eigenvalues really equal 0? How do we know that these eigenvalues correspond to $\lambda_{2}$? I suspect that all $\lambda$'s are ordered by multiplicity. But how can I prove that every $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrix has $n$ eigenvalues, counted with multiplicity. On the other hand, assume that $G$ is connected and that $x$ is an eigenvector of $L_{G}$ of eigenvalue $0$. As $L_{G}x=0$, we have $$x^{T}L_{G}x=\sum_{(u,v)\in E}^{} (x(u)-x(v))^{2} = 0.$$ Thus, for each pair of vertices $(u,v)$ connected by an edge, we have $x(u)=x(v)$. Why actually it's true if $u$ and $v$ are connected by an edge, we have $x(u)=x(v)$, it's not obvious for me, even if $x$ is eigenvector, and what happens in the general case? As every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$  are connected by a path, we may inductively apply this fact to show that $x(u)=x(v)$ for all vertices $u$ and $v$. Thus, $x$ must be a constant vector. We conclude that the eigenspace of eigenvalue $0$ has dimension $1$.
