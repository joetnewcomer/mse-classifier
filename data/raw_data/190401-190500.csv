3586891,homotopic $C^{2}$ paths are $C^{2}$ homotopic?,"The context is the following : Proposition : Let $E$ be a real Banach space, $\Omega \subseteq E$ open, $\omega \in C^{1}(\Omega,E^{*})$ a closed 1-form. Let be $\gamma_{0},\gamma_{1}$ $C^{2}$ two $\gamma$ -homotopic paths with fixed endpoints. It holds that $\int_{\gamma_{0}} \omega = \int_{\gamma_{1}} \omega$ . I do understand the proof I have of the above statement, which goes on defining $\phi(s) = \int_{\gamma(s,\bullet)} \omega$ and prooving that it's constant; What I don't get is the assumption (without loss of generality) that $\gamma$ , the homotopy between $\gamma_{0},\gamma_{1}$ , a priori $C^{0}$ , can actually be considered $C^{2}$ . Are there any known approximation Thorems for this? I thought about using Stone-Weierstrass or trying to approximate the homotopy with piecewise $C^{2}$ polygonals taken in appropriate dense set, failing. I found some references of what I'm looking for only between manifolds and smooth maps in the following links, but since manifold are above my knowledge i didn't find find any solution. Any help or comment would be appreciated,thanks.

3586908,Proof Verification - Convergence of a Sequence in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$,"Let $f$ be an element in the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{R})=W^{1,2}(\mathbb{R})$ . For every $h>0$ , let $$f_h(x)=\frac{1}{h}(f(x+h)-f(x))$$ Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0^+}\left\Vert f'-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ My proof seems to be unnecessarily long and anyone who can kindly check if there are any mistakes will be appreciated! Let $\mathcal{D}$ denote the set of all smooth, compactly supported functions $\varphi:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ . It is well-known that $\mathcal{D}$ is dense in $H^1(\mathbb{R})$ . So there is a sequence $(\varphi_n)$ in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{H^1(\mathbb{R})}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\left(\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}+\left\Vert \varphi_n'-f'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}\right)=0$$ It follows that $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n-f\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=\lim_{n\to \infty}\left\Vert \varphi_n'-f'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ So both $\varphi_n$ and $(\varphi_n')$ are convergent, hence Cauchy, in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . Hence, for any $\epsilon>0$ , there exists an $N_1\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$i,j>N_1\Rightarrow\left\Vert \varphi_i'-\varphi_j'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ For every $h>0$ and every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , define the function $$\varphi_{h,n}(x)=\frac{1}{h}(\varphi_n(x+h)-\varphi_n(x))$$ Now let $n$ be fixed. By the mean value theorem, for every $x$ , there exists some $y\in (x,x+h)$ such that $$\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2=\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_n'(y)\right|^2\leq 2\left\Vert \varphi_n\right\Vert_{C^1(\mathbb{R})}^2=M_n$$ So the sequence $(\left|\varphi_n'-\varphi_{h,n}\right|^2)_h$ is dominated by the Lebesgue integrable function $g_n=M_n\cdot\chi_{\text{support}(\varphi_n)}$ (which is a scalar multiple of a characteristic function). By the dominated convergence theorem, $$
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{h\to 0}\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2dx
&=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\lim_{h\to 0}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|^2dx \\
&=\int_{\mathbb{R}}\left[\lim_{h\to 0}\left|\varphi_n'(x)-\varphi_{h,n}(x)\right|\right]^2dx \\
&=0
\end{aligned}
$$ So for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ we have $$\lim_{h\to 0}\left\Vert \varphi_n'-\varphi_{h,n}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}=0$$ Furthermore, when $h$ is fixed, $(\varphi_{h,n})_n$ converges to $f_h$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ because $\varphi_n$ converges to $f$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . In particular, $(\varphi_{h,n})_n$ is Cauchy in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ . Hence, for any $\epsilon>0$ , there exists an $N_2\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$i,j>N_2\Rightarrow\left\Vert \varphi_{h,i}-\varphi_{h,j}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ Finally, we know that for arbitrary $m,n,p\in \mathbb{N}$ , $$

(i) Choose an $m_0>N_1$ and an $n_0>\max\{N_1,N_2\}$ such that $$\left\Vert f'-\varphi_{m_0}'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5};\qquad \left\Vert \varphi_{m_0}'-\varphi_{n_0}'\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ (ii) There exists an $h_0>0$ such that whenever $0<h<h_0$ , $$\left\Vert \varphi_{n_0}'-\varphi_{h,n_0}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ (iii) For any fixed $h\in (0,h_0)$ , choose a $p_0>N_2$ such that $$\left\Vert \varphi_{h,n_0}-\varphi_{h,p_0}\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5};\qquad \left\Vert \varphi_{h,p_0}-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\frac{\epsilon}{5}$$ We conclude that for every $h\in (0,h_0)$ , $$\left\Vert f'-f_h\right\Vert_{L^2(\mathbb{R})}<\epsilon$$ giving the result.","['solution-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

I want to prove $$\prod_{i=1}^k[G_i,G_i]=\left[\prod_{i=1}^k G_i,\prod_{i=1}^kG_i\right].$$ For $k=2$ , I am able to derive the equality $$\prod_{i=1}^2[G_i,G_i]=\left[\prod_{i=1}^2 G_i,\prod_{i=1}^2G_i\right].$$ However, assuming the equality for arbitrary $k\ge 2$ , I am only able to obtain the isomorphism $$\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}[G_i,G_i]\cong\left[\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} G_i,\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}G_i\right].$$ Let's assume the relation for some $k\ge 2$ . Let $I=\big\{(1,[1,k]),(2,\{k+1\})\big\}$ . Then $$\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}[G_i,G_i]\cong\prod_{j=1}^{2}\prod_{i\in I_j}[G_i,G_i].$$ Note that $\prod_{i\in I_j}[G_i,G_i]=\left[\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i,\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i\right]$ . Hence $$\prod_{j=1}^{2}\prod_{i\in I_j}[G_i,G_i]=\prod_{j=1}^{2}\left[\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i,\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i\right]=\left[\prod_{j=1}^{2}\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i,\prod_{j=1}^{2}\prod_{i\in I_j}G_i\right]\cong\left[\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}G_i,\prod_{i=1}^{k+1}G_i\right].$$ Therefore, I only possess a mere isomorphism instead of required equality.

3586957,On the ratio $\frac{F_n}{B_n}$,"One of the interesting limits that I came up with is: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F_{n}}{B_{n}}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \left( n \in \mathbb N^+\right)$$ Where $F_n$ is the nth Fibonacci number and $B_n$ is the nth Bell number . If $n$ is a natural odd number then it can be written as $n=2k-1$ , where $k\in \mathbb N^+$ , Using Stirling's approximation for the double factorial denoted $n!!=\left(2k-1\right)!!$ and the relation $B_{n}\ge n!!$ we have: $$0<\frac{F_{n}}{B_{n}} <\frac{F_{n}}{n!!}\sim  \frac{\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{2k-1}-\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{2k-1}}{\sqrt{5}}\cdot\frac{2^{k}\sqrt{2\pi k}\left(\frac{k}{e}\right)^{k}}{\sqrt{4\pi k}\left(\frac{2k}{e}\right)^{2k}}<\frac{2\cdot2^{k}}{k^{k}}$$ Taking the limit as $k \to \infty$ and using squeeze theorem follows: $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F_{n}}{B_{n}}=0$$ Which means as $n$ gets larger,the fraction with the numerator counting  the number of ways to tile a board of size $1×n$ with squares and dominoes of size $1×1$ and $1×2$ respectively and the dinominator counting all possible partitions of a set with cardinality $n+1$ gets smaller. The same can be done for $n$ even.
For more information refer to this link . Note : I've already proved that for all $k \in \mathbb N$ the relation $B_k\ge F_k$ holds, using this we conclude that: $$0<\frac{F_{n}}{B_{n}}\le1$$ The question is that: does there exist a more elegant way to prove this convergence?","['limits', 'bell-numbers', 'fibonacci-numbers']"

However, that approach fails when we consider the cases where $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to\infty}\space f(x)$ is infinite or non-existent. I've also tried to find a counterexample by experimenting with functions like $\frac{1}{x}\sin(x^{3})$ (which appeared promising since its derivative is unbounded) but so far I haven't found one and my intuition does not steer me to either of the answers.

We can extend this action to distributions $\mathcal{D}'(T) = (C^\infty(T))^*$ via $(Au)(g) = u(A^{-1}g)$ for any $g\in C^\infty(T)$ ; this agrees with the definition for continuous functions because $$ \int_T f(x)g(A^{-1}x) dx = \int_T f(Ax)g(x) dx $$ by using a linear change of variables and using that $\det(A)=1$ .

Now $\gcd(b_1,b_2)$ has strictly fewer prime factors than $b_1$ (since $p$ is not one of them), and we can let $p'$ be the smallest.

Continue in this fashion, and since the number of prime factors of $\gcd(b_1,\dots,b_t)$ is strictly decreasing with $t$ , there must be $T$ such that $\gcd(b_1,\dots,b_T)=1$ . Is this correct?

And why is $f$ even well defined (i.e. why does the sequence converge)? It seems as if there exists some $\xi\in[1,2]$ for which $$\forall x\in\mathbb R^+:f(x)=x^{-\xi}\qquad\xi\simeq 1.2$$ $f$ is undefined for negative values and diverges at $0$ : $$\lim\limits_{x\searrow0}f(x)\to\infty $$ Can anyone explain those properties / link to some proof? I'd be quite curious about the exact value of $\xi$ too. Also, if you're interested or don't trust me, I've created the plots with this program. So to clarify this a bit, the problem can be formulated the following way: Show that $$\xi:=-\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}-2^{3^{-4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\sigma(n)\cdot n}}}}}}\simeq1.1982330602188767$$ $$\sigma:\mathbb N\to\{-1,1\},\ n\mapsto\begin{cases}-1& n\mod2=0\\1&n\mod2=1\end{cases}$$ We can formulate this mathematically precisely: Let $\sigma$ be as defined previously, then define $$e:\mathbb N^2\to\mathbb R,\ (m,n)\mapsto\begin{cases}\sigma(m)\cdot m^{e(m+1,n)}&m<n\\\sigma(m)\cdot m&m=n\end{cases}$$ then $\xi$ is defined as $$\xi:=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}e(2,n)$$ For this we can proof that $\xi\in(-2,-1)$ by something like the following: $$\forall n\in\mathbb N:\ e(4,n)=-4^{r(n)}\quad r(n)>0\implies e(4,n)<-1$$ $$\implies e(3,n)=3^{e(4,n)}=\left|3^{e(4,n)}\right|<1$$ $$\implies e(2,n)=-2^{e(3,n)}\in(-2,-1)$$ However, this is not a full proof of convergence (but merely of limitedness). I feel like the proof of convergence should contain the value it converges to. But if the value of $\xi$ only appears by this construction, that's rather difficult. It would also suffice to proof the monotony of $e(2,\cdot)$ - however, it clearly isn't monotonous. Maybe, similarly to the proof I presented, the interval for $\xi$ can be minimized bit by bit, but I don't quite know how I'd proceed there. The above proof can easily be generified to the following ( $\forall n\in\mathbb N$ ): $$\forall m\in 2\mathbb N:\ e(m,n)<-1$$ $$\implies\forall o\in\mathbb N\setminus2\mathbb N:\ e(o,n)=|e(o,n)|<1$$ $$\implies\forall p\in2\mathbb N:\ e(p,n)\in(-m,-1)$$ However, a quick computer program indicates that $$\forall m\in2\mathbb N,\ n\gg m:\ e(m,n)\in(-2,-1)$$ I don't know if that's of any use though.","['power-towers', 'sequences-and-series']"

I know angles $\Theta_{1}, \Theta_{2}$ and line lengths $A$ , $B$ and $C$ , (where $A = a_{1} + a_{2}$ etc.). I'm trying to calculate the largest semi-circle I can fit on line $B$ (i.e., calculate r), that will (always?) be tangent to line $A$ and $C$ when the angles are acute. So I think: $$
r = \frac{B.sin\Theta_{1}  .sin\Theta_{2} } { sin\Theta_{1} + sin\Theta_{2} }
$$ For the cases where $A > a_{1}$ and $C > c_{1}$ (meaning A is longer than the theoretical tangent point at the angle $\Theta_{1}$ etc.). But what if $A$ was very short? Does $r$ simply become the distance to the end point of $A$ ? And how do I 'know' when this is the case mathematically? EDIT: To add some clarification... This is part of a larger effort to find the largest semi-circle that will fit inside an arbitrary closed polygon. The lines illustrated are thus three consecutive segments of that polygon They may be any angle and length, and don't form a triangle unless my polygon is a triangle. Clearly, if the angle at either or both ends is larger than $\pi$ , the semi-circle can go right to that vertex and isn't impinged upon by the next or previous segment. The part I'm mostly struggling with is incorporating the line length in determining $r$ and the centre point. Obviously, it has an effect at any given angle: My ultimate idea is to draw lines between every polygon vertex and calculate the largest semi-circle that will fit inside the polygon along that line. I hope that will give me a good guess at the largest generally that will fit. EDIT 2: Specifics... I know the blue values, how do I calculate $r$ (and thus $b_{2}$ and $b_{3}$ )?

I have also confirmed that, when representing $A=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$ in 4-space by changing coordinates from $x$ , $w$ , $y$ , and $z$ with \begin{align}
a&=(x-y)/\sqrt{2}\\
b&=(z-w)/\sqrt{2}\\
c&=(z+w)/\sqrt{2}\\
d&=(x+y)/\sqrt{2}
\end{align} the set of rotations $SO(2)$ is the great circle on $S^3(\sqrt{2})$ in the $xw$ -plane (with $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=2\implies x^2+w^2+y^2+z^2=2$ and $\det A = 1 \implies x^2+w^2-y^2-z^2=2$ , implying $x^2+w^2=2$ , $y=0$ and $z=0$ ) and the set of reflections $O^-(2)$ is the great circle in the $yz$ -plane (with $\det A = -1$ so $y^2+z^2=2$ , $x=0$ and $w=0$ ).  Finally, I have confirmed that all singular matrices on $S^3(\sqrt{2})$ lie on the Clifford torus defined by $x^2+w^2=1$ and $y^2+z^2=1$ (since we have $\det A = ad-bc = x^2+w^2-y^2-z^2=0$ and know that $x^2+w^2+y^2+z^2=2$ ).

are tubular neighborhoods of the great circles $SO(2)$ and $O^-(2)$ .

I was able to prove this was true for two of  the representations , now im trying to prove it for the other two, where in one we suppose that $t$ is given by $h(x)$ and $z$ is given by $k(w)$ , and the other one where $x$ is given by $j(t)$ and $z$ is given by $k(w)$ .

Then, setting $m=\ln(t+1)+x$ we must calculate the limit of $$\Big(\ln(t+1)+x\Big) \left(b+\ln \left(\left[1+\frac{b}{x} \right]^{x} \right)+\ln(t+1)\ln \left(1+\frac{b}{x} \right ) \right)$$ as $x$ goes to infinity. (The plan in this calculation is to use $e^b=\lim_{x \to \infty}(1+b/x)^x$ ) as some point. I have also tried to calculate the limit $(\ast)$ using L'Hopitals rule, but to no avail.

3588089,How to numerically perform analytic continuation?,"I understand that one can in theory analytically continue a function by repeatedly computing new Taylor series. Suppose for example we have an analytic function $f$ defined on some open set $U$ and compute $$T_0(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}(z-z_0)^n$$ for some $z_0\in U$ close to the boundary of $U$ . If this converges on $V$ where $U\cap V$ is non-empty, we can then compute another Taylor series to extend further: $$T_1(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{T_0^{(n)}(z_1)}{n!}(z-z_1)^n$$ for some $z_1\in V\setminus U$ etc. However, it is impossible to compute infinitely many terms and higher derivatives quickly become prone to large amounts of cancellation error. Furthermore, one must repeated drop the degree of the next series expansion, as demonstrated here , in order for the result to be useful. Otherwise, with the same degree at the new point $z_1$ , you will end up recovering the original $T_0$ and fail to approximate $f$ further away. So how can one actually numerically compute the analytic continuation of a function? In my specific case, I have a set of data points over a subinterval of $\mathbb R$ and I know some basic behavior about the function $f$ 's derivatives (all derivatives are positive over the subinterval and to the right, which is the area I want to continue to) and that it has no singularities to the right of the given subinterval.","['analytic-continuation', 'complex-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'numerical-methods', 'analytic-functions']"

So, with this, we can generalize the definition of a connection, but this time in a vector bundle, as follows: Definition : Let $\xi=(E,\pi)$ a differentiable vector bundle over a differentiable manifold $M$ . A connection on $\xi$ is a transformation: $$\nabla:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(T^*M\otimes E)$$ with the following properties: a) $\nabla(s)(fX+X',\theta)=f\nabla(s)(X,\theta)+\nabla(s)(X',\theta)$ . b) $\nabla(\lambda s+s')=\lambda\nabla s+\nabla s'$ c) $\nabla(fs)=f\nabla s+df\otimes s$ for all $s,s´\in\Gamma(E)$ , $X,X'\in\Gamma(TM)$ , $\theta\in\Gamma(E^*)$ , $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$ and $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ .

3588598,Classify the groups of order $88$ up to isomorphism.,"Classify the groups of order $88$ up to isomorphism. Here is what I have so far (I'm aware that there are $12$ groups, but I don't know which ones I'm missing as well as why the $3$ groups are abelian and the other $9$ are non-abelian.) We are asked to classify the groups of order $88$ up to isomorphism.  To prove that any group of order $88$ is abelian.  So if $|G|=88$ , then we can construct all abelian groups of order $88$ by using the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian groups.  We can use the Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups wich  states the following: Let $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Then \begin{equation}G\cong\Bbb Z^r\times\Bbb Z_{n_1}\times \Bbb Z_{n_2}\times\dots\times\Bbb Z_{n_s},\tag1\end{equation} For some integers $r,n_1,n_2,\dots,n_s$ satisfying the following conditions: $r\ge 0$ and $n_j\ge 2$ for all $j$ , and $n_{i+1}\mid n_i$ for $1\le i\le s-1$ The expression in $(1)$ is unique: if $G\cong\Bbb Z^t\times\Bbb Z_{m_1}\times \Bbb Z_{m_2}\times\dots\times\Bbb Z_{m_u}$ , where $t$ and $m_1,m_2,\dots,m_u$ satisfy 1. and 2. (i.e., $t\ge 0$ , $m_j\ge 2$ for all $j$ and $m_{i+1}\mid m_i$ for $1\le i\le u-1$ ), then $t=r$ , $u=s$ and $m_i=n_i$ for all $i$ . This gives us an effective way of listing all finite abelian groups of a given order.  Namely, to find (up to isomorphism) all abelian groups of a given order $n$ one must find all finite sequences of integers $n_1, n_2,\dots,n_s$ such that $n_j\ge 2$ for all $j\in\{1,2,\dots,s\}$ , $n_{i+1}\mid n_i$ , $1\le i\le s-1$ , and $n_1 n_2\dots n_s=n$ We can also note that every prime divisior of $n$ must divide the first invariant factor $n_1$ .  In particular, if $n$ is the product of distinct primes, which are all to the first power, which is called squarefree, we see that $n|n_1$ , hence $n=n_1$ .  This proves that if $n$ is squarefree, there is only one possible list of invariant factors for an abelian group of order $n$ .  The factorization of $n$ into prime powers is the first step in determining all possible lists of invariant factors for abelian groups of order $n$ . This means that we can break 8 $8$ down into its prime factors which would give us the following: $$88=2\cdot 44=2\cdot 2\cdot 22=2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 11$$ So if we say that $n=88=2^3\cdot 11$ , as we have stated above we must have that $2×11|n_1$ , so possible values of $n_1$ are as follows: $$n_1=2^3\cdot 11~\lor~n_1=2^2\cdot 11~\lor~n_1=2\cdot 11$$ For each of these we need to work out the possible $n_2$ ’s.  For each resulting pair $n_1,n_2$ we need to then work out the possible $n_3$ ’s and then continue in this manner until all lists satisfying 1. and 3. are obtained.
Therefore $88$ can be written as $2^3\cdot 11$ .  Which would give us the following: Order $p^\beta$ : Partitions of $\beta$ Abelian Groups $$2^3:~3,~\Bbb Z_8;~~~2,1,~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_2;~~~1,1,1,~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2$$ $$11^1:~1,~\Bbb Z_{11}$$ We can obtain the abelian groups of order $88$ by taking one abelian group from each of the two lists above and taking their direct product.  Doing this in all possible ways gives all isomorphism types: $$\Bbb Z_{88},~\Bbb Z_8\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{11},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{22},~\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_{22},~\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{44}$$ When we have completed this we will have $12$ groups.  By the Fundamental Theorems above, this is a complete list of all abelian groups of order $88$ , every abelian group of this order is isomorphic to precisely one of the groups above and no two of the groups in this list are isomorphic. We can then define abelian and non-abelian groups.  Abelian groups or commutative groups are groups in which the results of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written, in other words these groups are are groups that following the axiom of commutativity. Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.  Non-abelian groups, also known as non-commutative groups are groups $(G,*)$ in which there exists at least one pair of elements $a$ and $b$ of $G$ , such that $a*b\ne b*a$ . Of these $12$ groups $3$ of them are abelian and the other $9$ are non-abelian groups. The three abelian groups are $\Bbb Z_{88}$ , $\Bbb Z_4\times\Bbb Z_{22}$ , and $\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_2\times\Bbb Z_{22}$ .","['group-theory', 'finite-groups', 'groups-enumeration']"

3589571,Jacobians when integrating over symmetric and antisymmetric matrices,"I'm interested in integrals over matrix elements. For integrals over the elements of a symmetric matrix $S$ or an antisymmetric $A$ , how can I find the Jacobian of the transformations $S \rightarrow B^T S B$ or $A \rightarrow B^T A B$ , where B is some real invertible matrix? Below shares my work and my guesses for what the Jacobians should be. Here's a warmup that shows how I personally would find the Jacobian corresponding to a linear transformation of my matrix of interest. Consider an integral over the $d$ by $d$ dimensional matrix $X$ . That is, consider the integral $$\int_{\Gamma} f(X) dX .$$ $f(X)$ is schematic for a function of all the matrix elements. Here, $dX$ is schematic for $\prod_{i,j}^d dX_{ij}$ . $\Gamma$ is some $d^2$ -dimensional integration region. If I were to consider a real, invertible transformation $U=BX$ , one can quickly see by considering the columns of $X$ that $$\int_{\Gamma} f(X) dX = \int_{\Gamma} f(X) \prod_{j=1}^d \Big(\prod_{i=1}^d dX_{ij}\Big) = \int_{B\Gamma} f(B^{-1}X) \prod_{j=1}^d \frac{\prod_{i=1}^d dU_{ij}}{\det(B)} = \int_{B\Gamma} f(B^{-1}X)  \frac{\ dU}{\det(B)^d}.$$ That is, we have a Jacobian not of $\det(B)$ but of $\det(B)^d$ . One can check this makes sense by considering $B$ a constant $c$ times the identity matrix - then $\det(B) = c^d$ , and $\det(B)^d = c^{d^2}$ , which is exactly what one would get by scaling each of the $d^2$ elements of the matrix $X$ by $c$ . Thus, for $U=BX$ , we have $dX \rightarrow \frac{dU}{\det(B)^d}$ . Similarly, we can see that $$\text{for }U=B^TXB\text{, we have }dX \rightarrow \frac{dU}{\det(B)^{2d}}.$$ This can be seen quickly by performing the transformation in two steps and considering the columns and rows of $X$ . However, what if our integration was over a symmetric matrix $S$ ? That is, consider the integral $\int_{\Delta} f(S)dS.$ Here, $dS$ is schematic for $\prod_{i\geq j}^d dS_{ij}$ . Here, $\Delta$ is the integration region; counting the number of independent components of a symmetric matrix gives us that $\Delta$ must be a $\frac{1}{2}d(d+1)$ -dimensional region. Note that the transformation $U=B^TSB$ preserves the symmetry of $S$ : $U$ is also symmetric. Then, by counting the number of independent components, $\frac{1}{2}d(d+1)$ , I'd guess that $$\text{for } B^TSB\text{, we have } dS \stackrel{?}{\rightarrow} \frac{dU}{\det(B)^{d+1}}.$$ Similarly, for an antisymmetric matrix $A$ , we have that the transformation $U=B^T A B$ preserves the asymmetry; $U$ is also antisymmetric. Defining $dA = \prod_{i>j}^d dA_{ij}$ , and noting $A$ has $\frac{1}{2}d(d-1)$ independent components, I'd guess that $$\text{for } B^TAB\text{, we have } dA \stackrel{?}{\rightarrow} \frac{dU}{\det(B)^{d-1}}.$$ Are these guesses correct?

3589693,Complex Analysis vs. $\mathbb{R}^2$ Integrals,"I'm wondering about the following I'm somewhat shocked about, since I wasn't too aware of it, so I'm asking here for clarification or if it is even true... Let $f(z)$ be holomorphic. When calculating the closed loop integral over the contour $C$ and converting to real and imaginary parts, I get the following $$0=\oint_C f(z) \, {\rm d}z = \oint_C (u+iv) \, {\rm d}(x+iy) \\
=\oint_C \left\{ u \, {\rm d}x - v \, {\rm d}y + i\left(u \, {\rm d}y + v \, {\rm d}x\right) \right\} \\
=\oint_C \begin{pmatrix}u \\ -v \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} {\rm d}x \\ {\rm d}y \\ {\rm d}z \end{pmatrix} + i \oint_C \begin{pmatrix}v \\ u \\ 0\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} {\rm d}x \\ {\rm d}y \\ {\rm d}z \end{pmatrix} \, .
$$ In the last step I interpreted the planar curve $C$ as part of ${\mathbb{R}}^3$ . Now because of the $i$ each term has to vanish separately. Let's consider the first term first: Because $u$ and $v$ are harmonic functions, they are differentiable and thus Stokes theorem can be applied. The first term then becomes $$0=\int_A {\rm d}\vec{A} \cdot \nabla \times \begin{pmatrix}u \\ -v \\ 0\end{pmatrix} = -\int_A {\rm d}\vec{A} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \partial_x v + \partial_y u \end{pmatrix}$$ where $A$ is any oriented area bounded by the planar curve $C$ . Therefore $\begin{pmatrix}u \\ -v \\ 0\end{pmatrix}$ is integrable and can be expressed as a gradient i.e. $\begin{pmatrix}u \\ -v \\ 0\end{pmatrix}=\nabla \phi(x,y)$ . Plugging this into the CR-equations, it all makes sense $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = - \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Delta \phi = 0$$ i.e. $\phi$ is harmonic. The second equation reads $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial y \partial x} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x \partial y}$$ which is true due to Schwarz. I see that starting from the CR-equations and expressing $u$ and $v$ as a gradient, they are automatically fulfilled. But does this also mean that this is true in all generality? For every holomorphic function, the real and imaginary part is a gradient of some scalar potential $\phi$ that is harmonic i.e. every holomorphic function $f(z)$ can be decomposed as $$f(z) = \partial_x \phi - i\partial_y \phi = 2\,\partial_z \phi \, .$$ Since $\phi$ is harmonic, i.e. $4\partial_\bar{z}\partial_z \phi=0$ , it can be written as $$\phi(x,y) = \tilde{\phi}(z,\bar{z}) = \phi_1(z) + \phi_2(\bar{z}) \, ,$$ since mixed terms can not arise. But now $\phi$ is real $\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ , so $\phi_2=\bar{\phi}_1$ . So essentially it boils down to the fact that the 2d-laplacian nicely factorizes upon the variable transformation $(x,y)\rightarrow (z,\bar{z})$ .","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

There are two hints: Use the Fourier Expansion; 2. Separate the argument into $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\alpha\notin\mathbb{N}$ . However... I don't have any idea about how to solve this.. Any idea? Thank you! Edit: In the link above,  it suggested that if $\alpha\notin\mathbb{N}$ , then $f=\log\alpha$ , and asked the reader to further discover what happens if $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$ . So if $\alpha\notin\mathbb{N}$ , we have $$x_1\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1}+x_2\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}=0 \text{??}$$ Edit 2: Below is how I convert the exercise in the link above to this PDE: Within the context of this exercise, we have the coinciding solution of the Dirichlet problem $$\Delta u=0 \text{ on } B_1$$ $$u=f \text{ on } \partial B_1 =\mathbb{S}^1$$ and of the Neumann problem $$\Delta u=0 \text{ on } B_1$$ $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=e^f-\alpha \text{ on } \partial B_1=\mathbb{S}^1,$$ where $\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}= \nabla u\cdot \nu$ is the normal derivative of $u$ at the boundary with respect to the unit outer normal direction $\nu$ . Now, note that for a point $(x_1,x_2)\in\partial B_1 = \mathbb{S}^1$ , we always have $\nu=(x_1,x_2)$ . Also, by the solution of the Dirichlet problem, we know that $u=f$ on $\partial B_1=\mathbb{S}^1$ , and thus on the boundary we have $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu} = \nabla u\cdot \nu=x_1\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1} + x_2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2} = x_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} + x_2\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2},$$ but the boundary condition of Neumann problem is $$\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}=e^{f}-\alpha,$$ and thus we have $$x_1\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} + x_2\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} = e^{f(x_1,x_2)}-\alpha.$$ Edit 3: (initial value) As ""Ninad"" pointed out, we need to an initial value to decide what is $C(t).$ And I believe perhaps the initial value is related to whether $\alpha$ is natural or not. The exercise does not give what happens if $\theta=0$ . However, I missed one conditiona that $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb{S}^1)$ , a infinity smooth $2\pi-$ periodic function. I don't know if this helps to provide us the initial value.","['fourier-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'harmonic-analysis', 'analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
