1181682,Why is the group $Z_6$ under addition isomorphic to the group $Z_7^*$ under multiplication?,"Why is the group $Z_6$ under addition isomorphic to the group $Z_7^*$ under multiplication? So I'm trying to answer this question: Q. Which of the set are isomorphic to each other? $S_3$, $Z_6$, $Z_3 \times Z_2$ and $Z_7^*$ Now I know that $S_3$ is not because its not abelian while $Z_6$, $Z_3 \times Z_2$ are since my professor said this: The group $Z_n$ under addition is an abelian group which means $Z_6$ is abelian. Now another idea is:
The direct product of two cyclic groups $Z_m$ and $Z_n$ is isomorphic to ($Z_{mn}$,+) iff m and n are relatively prime. For $Z_3 \times Z_2$, 3 and 2 are relatively prime which means $Z_6$ and $Z_3 \times Z_2$ are isomorphic. Now, whats throwing me off is $Z_7^*$. I know $Z_7^*$ is composed of the elements {1,2,3,4,5,6}. So i've researched a bit online, and $Z_7^*$ has an order of 6 which I'm not understanding. Also, it was mentioned that $Z_7^*$ is abelian. Therefore, are all groups $Z_n^*$ under multiplication an abelian group? and why does $Z_7^*$ have an order of 6? Also, I've seen people say $Z_7^*$ is cyclic and has a generator such as 3, I'm not understanding that concept or in other words, how is 3 a generator? because if i do $3^6$=729 and that is not divisible by 7. Or if anyone has a different way to do this problem, that would help as well. I'm open to any ideas. thanks!","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
1181713,Convex function with non-symmetric Hessian,"Let $U$ be an open convex subset of $\mathbb R^n$ and $f:U\to\mathbb R$ a convex function on it. It is a well-known fact that if the second partial derivatives exist everywhere on $U$ and are all continuous ( i.e., if $f\in\mathcal C^2$), then the Hessian of $f$ is symmetric, that is, $\partial^2 f/(\partial x_i\partial x_j)=\partial^2 f/(\partial x_j\partial x_i)$ for any $i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. (Actually, $f$ needn't even be convex for this result.) In fact, Alexandroff's theorem states that the Hessian exists and is symmetric almost everywhere with respect to the $n$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, without any additional assumptions beyond convexity. Question : It is possible for $f$ to be twice differentiable (and thus have, not necessarily everywhere-continuous, second-order partial derivatives) everywhere on $U$ but a Hessian that is not symmetric at some $x\in U$? Update : Dudley (1977) gives an example of a convex function with an existent and asymmetric Hessian at the origin. This counterexample doesn't settle my question, however, because Dudley's function doesn't have a second-order (Fréchet) derivative ( i.e. , not twice differentiable) at the origin (even though the second-order partial derivatives exist). I would like to see a convex function with both an existent second-order Fréchet derivative and with asymmetric Hessian at some point (which necessarily implies that some of the second-order partial derivatives are discontinuous at that point).","['hessian-matrix', 'convex-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

1181879,Question about the elements of a reduced residue system relative a primorial $p_n\#$,"I've been dividing up the elements of reduced residue system relative a prime $p_n$ into congruence classes modulo $p_{n+1}$ and I noticed that each congruence class is represented. If $r$ = the number of elements in a reduced residue system relative $p_n\#$, I am finding that for each congruence class modulo $p_{n+1}$, there are at least $1+\left\lfloor\dfrac{r}{3p_{n+1}}\right\rfloor$ instances of each congruence class. For $5\#$, there are $8$ elements and we see at least $1$ of each relative $7$:  $(0,\{7\}), (1,\{1,29\}), (2,\{23\}), (3,\{17\}), (4,\{11\}), (5,\{19\}), (6,\{13\})$ For $7\#$, there are $48$ elements and we see at least $3 > 1+\left\lfloor\frac{48}{33}\right\rfloor$ for each relative $11$:

Is this always true? Edit 1:  Changed the term ""relative"" to ""modulo"" for congruence classes to make the question more clear. Edit 2: I wrote a simple application and identified the following for primes in relation to the reduce residue system relative $7\#$ Let $R_{7\#}$ be the reduced residue system relative $7\#$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $2$ sets of each distinct congruence classes modulo $13$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $2$ sets of each distinct congruence classes modulo $17$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $2$ sets of each distinct congruence classes modulo $19$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $1$ set of each distinct congruence class modulo $23$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $1$ set of each distinct congruence class modulo $29$ $R_{7\#}$ contains $1$ set of each distinct congruence class modulo $31$ For all other primes $> 31$, $R_{7\#}$ does not contain each distinct congruence classes.  For primes $> 209$, $R_{7\#}$ maps to $48$ distinct congruence classes only. Edit 2: I believe that I am starting to make progress in thinking about this question.  Here are some thoughts.  Please let me know if any of these ideas are wrong or unclear. Let $R_{p_i\#}$ be the reduced residue system relative $p_i\#$.

I've searched all over the internet (literally), including this site and https://stackoverflow.com/ .

Let $X$ be a topological space and let $f$ be a function from $X$ into $R$. (1) $f$ is lower semi-continuous if $\forall \alpha\in R$, the set $\{x\in X : f(x) > \alpha \}$ is open in X. (2) $f$ is upper semi-continuous if $\forall \alpha\in R$, the set $\{x\in X : f(x) < \alpha \}$ is open in X. I heard that semi-continuity is a generalization of one-sided continuity from left or right (as in single variable calculus) to continuity from ""below"" or ""above"", but I could not see from the definitions above how that is so. How can I see this intuitively?","['semicontinuous-functions', 'real-analysis']"
1182796,"Legendre Differential Equation, $y_1,y_2$ linearly independent solutions","$$(1-x^2)y''-2xy'+p(p+1)y=0, p \in \mathbb{R} \text{ constant } \\ -1 < x<1$$ At the interval $(-1,1)$ the above differential equation can be written equivalently $$y''+p(x)y'+q(x)y=0, -1<x<1 \text{ where } \\p(x)=\frac{-2x}{1-x^2} \\ q(x)= \frac{p(p+1)}{1-x^2}$$ $p,q$ can be written as power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_n x^n, \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q_n x^n$ respectively with centre $0$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p_n x^n=p(x)$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} q_nx^n=q(x), \ \forall -1<x<1$ $$p(x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (-2) x^{2n+1}, -1<x<1$$ $$q(x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} p(p+1) x^{2n}, \forall -1<x<1$$ Since $p,q$ can be written as power series with centre $0$ and radius of convergence $1$, it's logical to look for  a solution of the differential equation of the form $$y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n \text{ with radius of convergence } R>0$$ $$-2xy'(x)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} -2n a_n x^n$$ $$y''(x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2} x^n \\ -x^2y''(x)=\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} -n(n-1)a_nx^n$$ We have: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left[ (n+2)(n+1) a_{n+2}-n(n-1)a_n-2na_n+p(p+1)a_n\right]x^n=0, \forall x \in (-R,R)$$ It has to hold: $(n+2)(n+1)a_{n+2}-n(n-1)a_n-2na_n+p(p+1)a_n=0, \forall n=0,1,2, \dots$ Thus: $$a_{n+2}=-\frac{(p-n)(p+n+1)}{(n+1)(n+2)}a_n, \forall n=0,1,2, \dots$$ So the solution is written as follows: $$y(x)=a_0 \left[ 1- \frac{p(p+1)}{2!}x^2+ \frac{p(p-2)(p+1)(p+3)}{4!}x^4- \frac{p(p-2)(p-4)(p+1)(p+3)(p+5)}{6!}x^6+ \dots  \right] +a_1 \left[ x- \frac{(p-1)(p+2)}{3!}x^3+ \frac{(p-1)(p-3)(p+2)(p+4)}{5!}x^5-\frac{(p-1)(p-3)(p-5)(p+2)(p+4)(p+6)}{7!}x^7+ \dots\right]$$ We will show that if $p \in \mathbb{R} \setminus{\mathbb{Z}}$ then the power series at the right of $a_0,a_1$ have radius of convergence $1$ and so they define functions $y_1(x), y_2(x)$, that are infinitely many times differentiable at $(-1,1)$. We have for $-1<x<1, x \neq 0$: $$\left | \frac{a_{2(n+1)} x^{2(n+1)}}{a_{2n} x^{2n}}\right |= \left |-  \frac{(p-2n)(p+2n+1)}{(2n+1)(2n+2)}\right| |x|^2 \to |x|^2<1$$ So the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \overline{a_{2n}} x^{2n}$ converges for $-1<x<1$ In the same way, we show that the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \overline{a_{2n+1}}x^{2n+1}$ converges for $-1<x<1$. According to the above, if $p \in \mathbb{R} \setminus{\mathbb{Z}}$ the power series at the right of $a_0, a_1$ have radius of convergence $1$ and so they define functions $y_1(x), y_2(x)$ that are infinitely many times differentiable at $(-1,1)$. Then we show that $y_1(x)$ converges and in the same way we could show that $y_2(x)$ converges. But have we shown like that that the radius of convergence is $1$? And how do we deduce that the functions are infinitely many times differentiable? Also what is meant with $\overline{a_{2n}}$? Furthermore, what happens if $p \in \mathbb{Z}$? EDIT : Couldn't we also write the solution $y$ in the following form? $$y(x)= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{2k} x^{2k}+ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{2k+1} x^{2k+1}$$ where : $$a_{2k}= \frac{\prod_{j=0}^{2k-1} (j+(-1)^{j+1} p)}{(2k)!}a_0$$ and $$a_{2k+1}= \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{2k} (j+(-1)^j p)}{(2k+1)!}a_1$$ Or am I wrong? If it is like that, applying the ratio test we would get: For $n=2k$: $$\left| \frac{\frac{\prod_{j=0}^{2k+1} (j+(-1)^{j+1} p) a_0 x^{2k+2}}{(2k+2)!}}{\frac{\prod_{j=0}^{2k-1} (j+(-1)^{j+1} p) a_0 x^{2k}}{(2k)!}}\right| = \left| \frac{(2k-p)(2k+1+p) x^2}{(2k+1)(2k+2)} \right| \to |x^2|<1$$ So the series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{2k} x^{2k}$ converges for all $x$ such that $-1<x<1$. Is it right so far? If so,how do we deduce that if $p \in \mathbb{R} \setminus{\mathbb{Z}}$ then the power series at the right of $a_0,a_1$ have radius of convergence $1$ and so they define functions $y_1(x), y_2(x)$, that are infinitely many times differentiable at $(-1,1)$ ? EDIT 2 : If $p$ is a positive integer, then one of the series terminates and becomes polynomial. For example if $p=7$, then $a_7, a_9, a_{11}, \dots, a_{2n+1}=0$ and so $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{2k+1} x^{2k+1}= a_1 x+ a_3 x^3+ a_5 x^5$, right? So does this mean that in such a case it doesn't hold that  the power series at the right of $a_0,a_1$ have radius of convergence $1$ and so they define functions $y_1(x), y_2(x)$, that are infinitely many times differentiable at $(-1,1)$?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'convergence-divergence']"

means that we can write every subgroup $H$ of $G$ as
$$H=\langle h_1,h_2,\ldots,h_m\rangle$$
for some $h_i\in G$ and $m\leq n$. What I'm thinking so far: if $n=1$, then:
$$H=\langle h_1,h_2\rangle=\langle g^a,g^b\rangle=\langle g^{\gcd(a,b)}\rangle$$
So the statement is true for $n=1$. However for $n>1$ I'm having trouble proving/disproving it. I think it comes down to some number theory stuff that I'm not aware of. For example for the case $n=2$: Say $|g_1|=n, |g_2|=m$ $$H=\langle h_1,h_2,h_3\rangle =\langle g_1^{a_1} g_2^{a_2}, g_1^{b_1} g_2^{b_2}, g_1^{c_1} g_2^{c_2}\rangle$$

Attempt: Rudin gives the hint that we can reduce to the case $\mu\geq0$. I was able to do this without too much difficulty. The idea is that we can replace $d\mu$ by $pd\mu$ if $p$ is any trigonometric polynomial, and hence by $fd\mu$ if $f$ is continuous, and therefore if $f$ is a bounded Borel function (by Lusin's theorem). Hence, since $d\mu=hd|\mu|$ for some $h\in L^1(|\mu|)$ with $|h|=1$, and since bounded functions are dense in $L^1(|\mu|)$, we can replace $d\mu$ by $d|\mu|$. But then I am not sure how to proceed.

Show that $\left| N \cap Z(G) \right| > 1.$ Proof. Let $a \ast n = C_a(n) = ana^{-1}$ for $a \in G$ and $n \in N$. Since $1 \ast n = C_1(n) = n$ for all $n \in N$ and $a \ast (b \ast n) = C_a(C_b(n)) = (C_a \circ C_b)(n)   = C_a(bnb^{-1}) = abnb^{-1}a^{-1} = abn(ab)^{-1} = C_{ab}(n) = (ab) \ast n.$ It follows that $\ast$ is an action of $G$ on $N$ by conjugation. Let $N^G$ denote the set of $G$-fixed points and note that $N^G  = N \cap Z(G)$ (Since the elements that commute with $G$ are invariant under conjugation). Thus, we obtain $| Z(G) \cap N | \equiv | N | \equiv 0 \mod p$. This implies that $p$ divides $| Z(G) \cap N |$, and so $|Z(G) \cap N| \geqslant p > 1$. Edit:
$| Z(G) \cap N | \equiv | N |$ is a result of the following corollary: Let $G$ be a $p$-group and let $X$ be a finite $G$-set. Then $|X^G| \equiv |X| \mod p$. One has $| N | \equiv 0 \mod p$, since $G$ and $N$ are $p$-groups and so have orders equal to some power of $p$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

Question Why are the intersection points $(x_{1},y_{1})=(0,\alpha)$ and $(x_{1}',y_{1}')=(1/\alpha,0)$ equivalent? What is the geometric meaning of this? Thanks,
Jack.","['projective-space', 'blowup', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Want to improve this question? Add details and clarify the problem by editing this post . Closed 9 years ago . Improve this question I know for irreducible and positive recurrent Markov Chain there exists an unique stationary distribution. For Markov Chain with several communication classes (example C1, C2) there exist stationary distributions (linear combination of $ \pi $1 and $ \pi $2). But how about this one, states {1,2,3} can communicate with each other while state {4} can access to other states. $$

1183349,Find the coordinate of third point of equilateral triangle.,"I have two points A and B whose coordinates are $(3,4)$ and $(-2,3)$ The third point is C. We need to calculate its coordinates. I think there will be two possible answers, as the point C could be on the either side of line joining A and B. Now I put AB = AC = BC. We calculate AB by distance formula : $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ = $ \sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{26}$ I plug this value into the distance of AC and BC and finally equate to get : $5x + y = 6$ Now what can I do? There are two variables, I am getting equation of a line! How can I solve this?","['analytic-geometry', 'algebra-precalculus']"
1183350,A stronger definition of locally free modules,"Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , Section 4.6, Exercise 4.12 (a) tells us if $M$ is a finitely presented $R$-module, then $M$ is projective if and only if $M$ is locally free in the stronger sense that there is a finite set of elements $f_1,\ldots,f_n\in R$ such that $(f_1,\ldots,f_n)=R$ and $M[f_i^{-1}]$ is a free $R[f_i^{-1}]$-module for every $i$. My question is: could we add some finiteness condition on $R$, say $R$ is noetherian, such that in the second half of the above statement the choice of $f_1,\ldots,f_n $ is independent of the module $M$? In other words, is there a finite set of elements $f_1,\ldots,f_n\in R$ such that $(f_1,\ldots,f_n)=R$ and any $R$-module $M$ is projective if and only if $M[f_i^{-1}]$ is a free $R[f_i^{-1}]$-module for every $i$?","['commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'noetherian']"

1183430,Show that the map $F(q)=\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ is conformal.,"Show that the map $F(q)=\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ is conformal. One way to show that a map is conformal is by looking at the first fundamental form. But since we don't have matrix here, we can recall that $\cos\theta=\frac{X\cdot Y}{|X||Y|}$. So if we can show that $\frac{X\cdot Y}{|X||Y|}=\frac{DF(X)\cdot DF(Y)}{|DF(X)DF(Y)|}$, we win. Then I computed what $DF(v)$ is, assuming that $v \in T_p M$: Consider a curve parametrized curve $\alpha(t)$ on the surface, such that $\alpha(0)=p$ and $\alpha'(0)=v$, then we have: $DF(v)=\frac{dF\circ\alpha}{dt}=\frac{|q|^2v-q\frac{d}{dt}(|q|^2)}{|q|^4}=\frac{|q|^2v-2q(q\cdot v)}{|q|^4}$ Once we have this, I computed $DF(X)\cdot DF(Y)$, which yields $|q|^4(X\cdot Y)$. But I don't know how to calculate $|DF(X)DF(Y)|$. Any idea? Thanks!",['differential-geometry']
1183460,One-sided nilpotent ideal not in the Jacobson radical?,"Problem XVII.5a of Lang's Algebra, revised 3rd edition, is: Suppose $N$ is a two-sided nilpotent ideal of a ring $R$. Show that
  $N$ is contained in the Jacobson radical $J: = \{ \cap\, I: I \text{ a
 maximal left ideal of } R \}$. I put my solution below the fold. My question is: can't we generalize a bit more? It seems that all we need is that $N$ is a nil ideal; further, I don't see why $N$ can't be merely a one-sided ideal. I assume there's some error in my thinking here... Solution: Take $y \in N$, and show that $1-xy$ has a left inverse for all $x\in R$ (this is an equivalent characterization of the Jacobson radical, see here ). The way to construct the left inverse is to note that $xy \in N$, so $\exists k$ s.t. $(xy)^k= 0$, so $(1 + xy + \dotsb + (xy)^{k-1})(1-xy)=1$.","['ring-theory', 'ideals', 'abstract-algebra']"
1183463,"If $f\colon M^n\to N^n$ is proper, $N$ is connected, and $f_*$ preserves orientation at regular points, then $f$ is surjective?","I'm attempting Exercise 8.21 from Spivak's Differential Geometry . It is not for homework or anything. The problem states Let $f\colon M^n\to N^n$ be a proper map between oriented $n$-manifolds such that $f_*\colon M_p\to N_{f(p)}$ ($f_*$ here is $df_p$ in other texts I think) is orientation preserving whenever $p$ is a regular point. If $N$ is connected, then either $f$ is onto $N$, or else all points are critical points of $f$. First, since $f$ is a proper map between manifolds, it is closed, and thus $\operatorname{im}(f)\subset N$ is closed. I want to show, assuming that there is a regular point of $f$ in $M$, then $\operatorname{im}(f)$ is open, hence all of $N$ since $N$ is connected. If $p$ is a regular point, so $f_*\colon M_p\to N_{f(p)}$ is surjective, so is also bijective since $M$ and $N$ are both $n$-dimensional. By the inverse function theorem, $f$ is a local diffeomorphism, so maps an open neighborhood of $p$ onto an open neighborhood of $f(p)$. If I could show arbitrary $q\in\operatorname{im}(f)$ is in one of these neighborhoods, then I would be done. If $q$ is not in the diffeomorphic image of any open neighborhood of a regular point of $f$, does this contradiction the orientation preserving property somehow?","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
