45482,about a subset of the multidimensional cube,"Let $[0,1]^{n+2}$ be the ($n+2)$-dimensional unit cube. Consider the set
$A\subset[0,1]^{n+2}$ consisting of all points $(x_{1},...,x_{n+2})$
such that  $x_{i}=0$, $x_{j}=1$ for some $i,j\in\{1,...,n+2\}$. My question:
is it true that the set $A$ is homeomorphic to the $n$-dimensional sphere
$\mathbb{S}^{n}$ and how to show this (if true)? If the answer is negative,
then what is the homotopy type of $A$? Note that $A$ is the union of $(n+1)(n+2)$ $n$-dimensional faces of
$[0,1]^{n+2}$ and is symmetric with respect to the center of the cube. For
example, in case $n=1$, $A$ is the union of 6 edges of $[0,1]^{3}$ forming a (topological)

45504,On a characterization of the tamely ramified coverings of the fraction field of a strict Henselian ring,"Let $K$ be the field of fractions of a strictly Henselian discrete valuation ring $A$. Following Milne (""Etale Cohomology"", Chapter I, Paragraph 5,
example e)), $Spec(K)$ is the algebraic analogue of a punctured disc in the plane. The cited example is about the calculation of the tame fundamental group (in the Grothendieck sense) of that disc.
Milne, citing Serre (""Corps Locaux"", Chapter IV), says that every tamely ramified extension of $K$ (so every tamely ramified covering of $Spec(K)$) is a
Kummer extension of $K$. Unfortunately the book of Serre seems to explain only the restrictive case: $K=\mathbb{C}((z))$. Why this is true in general?
In specific the problems seem to arise when the characteristic of the residue field of $A$ is not zero anymore. I thought also to have problems, related to this question, regarding the possible non algebraic closure of the residue field of $A$. But, since we are looking only for tamely ramified extensions, the strict Henselianity of $A$ is enough to avoid those problems. Moreover I'm interested in the more general case of $A$ being the strict Henselianization of the stalk $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ of a sheaf on a point $x$ of a scheme $X$, so $A$ being
strictly Henselian but not a discrete valuation ring anymore. I would like to have the same result (or something similar) als in this situation. So, how much is deep the request of $A$ being a discrete valuation ring? Or, can I restrict to that case in any situation?

45557,Summation Formula for Product of Two Distinct Integers within a Range (Derivation of Covariance),"I am trying to follow the derivation for the covariance of two discrete random variables. The joint distribution of the two random variables is known: $$ P(x=a, y=b) = \frac{1}{(m+n)(m+n-1)},$$

45627,Grothendieck connections and jets,"The following question is based on some remarks in section I.2 of Deligne's book Equations Différentielles à Points Singuliers Réguliers . Let $X$ be a smooth complex variety and $X_1$ the first infinitesimal neighborhood of the diagonal in $X \times X$, so there is a natural morphism $X \to X_1$. If we write $p_1,p_2 : X_1 \to X$ for the two projections, then the first-order jet bundle of a vector bundle $V$ on $X$ is defined to be $J^1(V) = p_{1*} p_2^*V$. Here ""upper star"" is used in the sense of $\mathcal{O}$-modules. This allows for a convenient way of expressing the notion of a connection: this is just an isomorphism $p_1^*V \to p_2^*V$ which restricts to the identity over $X$, which is the same as an $\mathcal{O}$-linear map $V \to J^1(V)$ such that the composition $V \to J^1(V) \to V$ is the identity. Here Deligne says something I don't understand: he refers to a first-order differential operator $j^1 : V \to J^1(V)$ ""which associates with any section a first-order jet"" (I'm translating from the French).

45648,Is the Ratio of Associative Binary Operations to All Binary Operations on a Set of $n$ Elements Generally Small?,"I started thinking about the number of associative (binary) operations on a set with $n$ elements today.  Looking online I found this paper which indicates only $113$ of the possible $19,683$ operations on a three-element set satisfy association.  So, $50\%$ of binary operations on a two-element set satisfy association, and less than $0.6\%$ of all binary operations on a three element set satisfy association.  For an $n$-element set, where $n$ denotes a natural number, is the ratio $R_{n}=A_{n}/B_{n}$, of the number of associative binary operations $A_{n}$ to the number of all binary operations $B_{n}$, in general small?  I don't mean the following questions as equivalent, but since they seem more concretely answerable in principle, does $$
\lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{A_{n}}{B_{n}} = 0 ?
$$ Also, is $F : n \to R_{n}$ a monotonically decreasing function? Some Background of the Question: In his Linear Algebra Problem Book 1995 on p. 6 Paul Halmos writes ""The commonly accepted attitudes toward the commutative law and the associative law are different.  Many real life operations fail to commute; the mathematical community has learned to live with that fact and even to enjoy it.  Violations of the associative law, on the other hand, are usually considered by specialists only.""  For all I know, Halmos might only have written that to motivate the study of Linear Algebra and doesn't quite literally mean what he appears to say.  But, if he means what he appears to say, and if $F : n \to R_{n}$ is monotonically decreasing, or $R_{n}$ is generally small, I think there's something amiss with what Halmos says, since non-associative operations seem so common that one may as well enjoy them.","['analysis', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"
45649,Rationals are not locally compact and compactness,"I was wondering if someone can please help me with the following problems: Show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is not locally compact. Prove that if $X$ is Lindelöf and $Y$ is compact then $X \times Y$ is Lindelöf. I think I got 1, here's my work: Suppose $\mathbb{Q}$ is locally compact and let $x \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then by definition of local compactness (for Hausdorff spaces) we can find an open set $U \subset \mathbb{Q}$ such that $\overline{U}$ is compact. Since the open intervals form a basis for the usual topology then we can find an open interval $(a,b)$ such that $x \in (a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q} \subset U$. Then observe $[a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \overline{U}$. But $[a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is closed so we have a closed subset of the compact set $\overline{U}$ , thus $[a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is compact. Hence it suffices to show this set is not compact. Now pick an irrational number $z \in (a,b)$ then we can find a sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ of consisting of rational numbers in $(a,b)$ such that $x_{n} \rightarrow z$. But $[a,b] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ is compact so sequentially compact. Therefore the sequence $\{x_{n}\}$ must have a subsequence converging to a point in $(a,b) \cap \mathbb{Q}$, which is impossible because every subsequence converges to $p$ and $p$ is irrational. Is this OK? 2) Stuck in this one for a while. How to prove this?","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

45699,$f$ is differentiable and $\lim_{x\to \infty }f(x)=\lim_{x\to -\infty }f(x)=0$,"This is quiet a simple question, but still I'm not sure that I am correct. Let $f$ be a differentiable function in $\mathbb{R}$ such that: $\lim_{x\to \infty }f(x)=\lim_{x\to -\infty }f(x)=0.$ We need to prove that there is $a\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f'(a)=0$. If f is permanent, it is obvious. If it is not, there must be a maximum or minimum. I know (Maybe I am wrong) that If the limits in $\infty$ and  $-\infty$ are final, so the function is  uniformly continuous by Kantor theorem, and then we may say that If it uniformly continuous it is bounded, and thus gets it minimum and maximum?

The surface area of a sphere is the rate of change of the volume of that sphere at radius R because an infinitely thin skin of sphere laid on top of the sphere is exactly the surface area. So for a cube, you'd think the same thing.  But $V_{\text{cube}} = x^3$ and $SA_{\text{cube}} = 6x^2$, where you'd expect $SA_{\text{cube}}=3x^2$ if surface area were just the derivative of volume.

45784,Reconciling 'intersecting planes' and 'linear transformation' interpretations of matrices,"I've learned in linear algebra class that an $n \times m$ augmented matrix can be thought of as a collection of n planes in $\mathbb {R}^m$ . If the matrix is invertible, the planes all intersect at a single point. If it has infinite solutions, two or more planes coincide and so their intersection is a line rather than a point. If the matrix is inconsistent then there is no one single point of intersection. When you do Gauss-Jordan elimination, you are adding scalar multiples of the planes to each other, which has the effect of rotating them over the line where they intersect. When they attain RREF, they are at right angles to each other in the dimensions corresponding to columns that contain leading ones. But then we go on to another interpretation of matrices as linear transformations for altering the magnitude and direction of vectors. I would like to have a geometric interpretation of matrix multiplication that is compatible with the intersecting planes interpretation. Since matrix multiplication is built from row by column dot-products, I guess the first step would be to visualize those. First question: Am I correct in interpreting the dot-product of two vectors as the cosine of the angle between them scaled to the magnitude of both vectors, with a value somewhere between the length of the shadow vector A casts on vector B and the length of vector B. Is there anything more specific I should associate with this quantity? Second question: Now let's say we multiply a $3 \times 3$ matrix by a vector $\in \mathbb R^3$ and get a different vector $\in \mathbb R^3$. How do I interpret it graphically relative to the three intersecting planes and one line through the origin that gave rise to it? Third question: Can anybody recommend some software I can use for visualizing matrix operations, especially on Linux?

So I was wondering, if we use $ \langle g , h \rangle_{\Omega} = \int_{\Omega} f(x) \overline{g(x)} d\mu(x) $ as the natural inner product, and define $ \zeta_{\Omega}(s) = \sum \lambda^{-s} $ wherever it converges and analytically continued otherwise, is the following necessarily true?
$$ \langle \phi(\alpha,\cdot) , \phi(\beta,\cdot) \rangle_{\Omega} = \zeta_{\Omega}(\alpha + \beta^*).$$ EDIT : It might help to reconsider this in a more general setting. Holding $\beta$ fixed above, the inner product can be seen as a functional $B:L^2(\Omega)\to\mathbb{C}$ acting on $\phi(\alpha,x)$ with respect to $x$. Similarly, analytic continuation may be seen as an operator $A:\Omega\to\Gamma\supset\Omega$ which, for $f\in C^\infty(\Gamma)$, sends the restriction $f|_\Omega$ to $f$ - in this case acting on $\phi(\alpha,x)$ with respect to $\alpha$. The question above is therefore a special case of a more generalized query: do $A$ and $B$ commute wherever their composition makes sense?

For each $y \in Y$, we choose the subset $ \lbrace U_{i_j} \rbrace $ such that $y \in U_{i_j}$, and then define $V = \bigcap_{j=1}^k f(U_{i_j})$, and $U'_j = U_{i_j} \bigcap f^{-1}(V)$. ... and this is were I got stuck. I really want to write that $f^{-1}(V) = \bigcup_{j=1}^k U'_j$ (more or less proving it's a covering map), but I can't justify that, and I actually think that it's not true. I think I might need an extra step, and to take an even smaller neighborhood of $y$, in order to make sure that extra sets from $ \lbrace U_i \rbrace $ didn't sneak into $f^{-1}(V)$. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I've already spent several hours working on this problem.","['general-topology', 'covering-spaces']"

46002,Necessary and sufficient condition for the coefficients of a quartic,"I need some help with the following problem. Many thanks in advance. Let $f(x) = x^2+px+q$ and $g(x) = x^2+rx+s$. Find an expression for $f(g(x))$ and hence find a necessary and sufficient condition on $a$, $b$, $c$ for it to be possible to write the quartic expression $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ in the form $f(g(x))$, for some choice of values of $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$. Okay the first thing I did was to find $f(g(x))$: $\begin{aligned}f(g(x)) & = (x^2+rx+s)^2+p(x^2+rx+s)+q \\& = x^2(x^2+rx+s)^2+rx(x^2+rx+s)+s(x^2+rx+s)+px^2+prx+ps+q \\& = x^4+rx^3+sx^2+rx^3+r^2+x^2+rsx+sx^2+srx+s^2+px^2+prx+ps+q \\& = x^4+(2r)x^3+(p+2s+r^2)x^2+(2rs+pr)x+s^2+q+ps \end{aligned}$ So we wish to have: $x^4+(2r)x^3+({p}+2s+r^2)x^2+(2rs+pr)x+s^2+q+ps \equiv x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ Comparing the coefficients, $r = \frac{1}{2}a$, $2s = b-\frac{1}{4}a^{2}-{p}$, and $c = r(2s+p)$, thus $c = \frac{ab}{2}-\frac{1}{{8}}a^{{3}} $. I understand that this condition is 'necessary' -- my problem is that I'm not quite sure how to make it sufficient. I'm not quite sure how I'm supposed to choose some suitable values of p, q, r and s. Show further that this condition holds if and only if it's possible to write the quartic expression $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$ in the form $(x^2+vx+w)^2-k$, for some choice of values v, w, q, r, s. $\begin{aligned}  (x^2+vx+w)^2-k & = x^2(x^2+vx+w)+vx(x^2+vx+w)+w(x^2+vx+w)-k \\& = x^4+vx^3+wx^2+vx^3+vx^2+wvx+wx^2+vwx+w^2-k \\& = x^4+(2v)x^3+(2w+v^2)x^2+(2vw)x+w^2-k. \end{aligned}$ I see that the 'suitable choice' would have been q = 0, but how was I supposed to see that?","['quartics', 'algebra-precalculus', 'polynomials']"

46038,Proof that cube has 24 rotational symmetries,"I was doing a combinatorics problem which states this definition of symmetry: for a subset $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ a symmetry is ""rigid motion"" $f:\mathbb{R^3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R^3}$ such that any $x\in S$ has its image $f(x)$ also in S. (To provide some fodder for the problem, the author dumbs it down for me that a symmetry is some operation which leaves $S$ in the same place although the individual points may be rearranged) From this working definition it is asked to find the number of rotational symmetries of the cube. So far I have seen two different arguments and I still dont know because drawing on paper is getting confusing. Also my solution was incorrect and I dont know where I undercounted. Ignore my method. Drawing 4 axis perpendicular with the faces, each with 4 rotational symmetries $(0^\circ,90^\circ,180^\circ,270^\circ)$ and I get $4\times 4 =16$ symmetries. Plus the four body diagonals$=20$. This is wrong and the answer is $24$. The book gives the short solution: ""move any vertex to any other and rotate the edges leading to it in three ways"". I don't get it. There are 8 vertices, and 3 ways of what? I google and get another argument from wikipedia : ""The group of orientation-preserving symmetries is S4, or the group of permutations of four objects, since there is exactly one such symmetry for each permutation of the four pairs of opposite sides of the octahedron."" Indeed $4!=24$ but I cannot convince myself that aall permutations of the pair of opposite edges is all the symmetries there can be (I clearly undercounted when I got 16 and still have no insight why, so this does not help me as I dont know for sure there cant be more) My imagination and visualization skills are very weak.

I have wiki it . But it does not work for me. I will give some easy  ""proofs"" to explain my confusion. Prove that every set has the same cardinality with itself. I prove it by contradiction. Suppose this statement is not true, then we pick one from what?... The elements fail in this statement cannot form a set?(How do I test whether it is a set? Is ""pick"" not a map which defined by set-theory ?). Even this is not a set, we still can pick one, right? Confusion comes from induction. General speaking, I donot encounter troubles use induction. But many authors like the following manner which I think is equivalent to induction: Suppose statement $S$ is not true for all natural numbers. By well ordered property of natural numbers, we can find a smallest number $n$ such that $S(n)$ is not true. Then....
Until here no problems. But what if the elements in $S(n)$ is not a set. For example, we want to show statement about all finitely generated $R$-module is true. When $R$ runs, module structure runs, can I say that ""since $S(n)$ is not true, say $(M,T)$ is false in $S$,(where $M$ is a $T$ module generated by $n$ elements)"" ? But here we can fix a ring $R$ first, then continue. I think there are several inconsistencies in my argument. Next is a wrong proof but not wrong too much. Show every field has an algebraic closure. proof. Say $k$ a field. Consider $\Sigma=\{L|L \text{ is an algebraic extension of }k\}$. Apply zorn's lemma, easily find a maximal element in $\Sigma$, then this element is a algebraic closure of $k$. But be carefully, we do not test whether $\Sigma$ is a set! All right. I am sorry, I cannot figure out what my confusions. I am not familiar with set-theory. What exactly is a statement?

 X\,\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} = 0 \>.$$ Could anyone provide a detailed proof? I'm wondering since $\mathbb{E}|X|<\infty$, can I use the fact $|X|<\infty \;\mathrm{a.e.}$ then $\exists M \in \mathbb{R}^{+} \,\mathrm{s.t.}\, |X|<M \;\mathrm{a.e.}$
Then $\int_{\Lambda_{n}} X\,\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P} \leq M \,\mathbb{P}\{\Lambda_{n}\}\rightarrow 0$. And, can I use this lemma to prove that every $X \in L^{1}$ is uniformly integrable, using Thm 4.5.3 in Chung's book 'A course in probability theory'? Hence, every finite set of $\{X_{n} \subset L^{1}\}$ is uniformly integrable.
However, why infinite set (possibly countably infinite) may not be uniformly integrable? Sorry to entangle these two questions together.",['probability-theory']
46292,How do you express a circle with vector arithmetic?,"I've spent the day learning elementary vector math and I'm curious: how can a circle be represented through vector notation? My textbook doesn't mention it, and Google doesn't seem to help. Thanks! Edit: in case my question doesn't make sense, what I mean by vector math is, e.g. representing a line using notation such as $$r = (a,b,c) + \alpha(d,e,f)$$",['multivariable-calculus']
