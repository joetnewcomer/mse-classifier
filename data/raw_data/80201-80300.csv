1036038,Weak tangent but not a strong tangent,"Question: Show that $\alpha(t)=(t^3,t^2)$, $t\in \Bbb R$, has a weak tangent but not a strong tangent at $t=0$. Definitions from this answer : (Weak tangent) $\alpha: I \to \Bbb R^3$ has a weak tangent at $t_0 \in I$, if the line determined by $\alpha(t_0 + h)$ and $\alpha(t_0)$ has a limit position when $h \to 0$. (Strong tangent) $\alpha: I \to \Bbb R^3$ has a strong tangent at $t_0 \in I$, if the line determined by $\alpha(t_0 + h)$ and $\alpha(t_0 + k)$ has a limit position when $h \to 0$ and $k \to 0$. My query: I'm not really clear what argument to use to demonstrate this. The weak tangent is the line joining $\alpha(t_0)$ and $\alpha(t_0+h)$, which is
$$
(\lambda(x(t_0+h)-x(t_0))+x(t_0), \lambda(y(t_0+h)-y(t_0))+y(t_0))
$$
If $t_0=0$ then $x(t_0)=0$ so this becomes
$$
(\lambda h^3, \lambda h^2)
$$
The strong tangent is
$$
(\lambda(x(t_0+h)-x(t_0+k))+x(t_0+k), \lambda(y(t_0+h)-y(t_0+k))+y(t_0+k))
$$
$$
=(\lambda (h^3-k^3)+k^3,\lambda (h^2-k^2)+k^2)
$$
As $h,k\rightarrow0$ this seems badly defined. But how can I make this argument precise? Also, what is the intuitive meaning of the strong and weak tangents? [This is exercise 1-3-7 of Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by Do Carmo.]",['differential-geometry']

1036091,Finding the convergent value of a recursion similar to Arithmetic-Geometric Mean recursion,"The sequence is defined as follows : Start : $(x_0,y_0)$ with $ 0 < x_0 < y_0 $ Step  : $x_{n+1} = \frac {x_n+y_n} {2}$ ,  $y_{n+1}= \sqrt{x_{n+1}y_n} $ Find  $\lim_{n\to \infty}(x_n,y_n)$ . I have proved that the sequences do converge by showing that the sequences are monotone bounded sequences. The prove goes as follows ,
First we will prove that: If $0<x_k<y_k<a$ then $0<x_{k} < x_{k+1} < y_{k+1} < y_k < a$. $0<\frac {x_k+x_k} 2 = x_k <x_{k+1} = \frac {x_k+y_k} 2 < \frac {y_k+y_k} {2}=y_k$  and $x_{k+1}=\sqrt{x_{k+1}x_{k+1}} <y_{k+1} =\sqrt{x_{k+1}y_k} < \sqrt{y_ky_k}=y_k<a$ Thus   $\,0<x_k<x_{k+1}<y_{k+1}<y_k<a$. It follows that $0<x_n<x_{n+1}<y_{n+1}<y_n<y_0$. Hence the $x_n$ and $y_n$ are monotone bounded sequence. Hence the sequence $(x_n,y_n)$ converges.
Let $\lim_{x \to \infty } x_n=\lim_{x\to \infty} x_{n+1}=l$ $\lim_{x \to \infty } y_n=\lim_{x\to \infty} y_{n+1}=w$ $l=\lim_{x\to \infty}x_{n+1}=\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac {x_n+y_n} {2}=\frac{\lim_{x\to \infty} x_n+\lim_{x\to \infty} y_n} {2}=0.5l+0.5w$. Hence $l=w$.I am unable to find the convergent value. I would like some assistance on this. I think  $\lim_{x\to \infty}(x_n,y_n)$ exists for a more general recursion Start : $(x_0,y_0)$ with $ 0 < x_0 < y_0 $ Step  : $x_{n+1}=tx_n+(1-t)y_n $ with $t\in(0,1)$  ,  $y_{n+1}= \sqrt{x_{n+1}y_n} $ In this case what is the value of $\lim_{x\to \infty}(x_n,y_n)$ ?

1036164,Definitions of Platonic and Archimedean Solids using Symmetry Groups?,"A Platonic Solid is defined to be a convex polyhedron where all the faces are congruent and regular, and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. An Archimedean Solid drops the requirement that all the faces have to be the same, but they must still all be regular, and each vertex must have the same arrangement of faces. However, for Archimedean Solids, the pseudorhombicuboctahedron fits this definition, despite not being vertex-transitive (meaning that the rotation group of the solid does not act transitively on the vertices). I was wondering: For Platonic Solids, is it equivalent to define them as convex polyhedra that are face, vertex, and edge-transitive (where for Archimedean solids, we drop the face-transitivty condition)? Face-transitivity forces all the faces to be congruent, edge-transitivity forces all the faces to be equilateral, and vertex-transitivity forces the same number (or arrangement, in terms of Archimedean solids). It's not immediately obvious to me that these conditions force the faces to be equiangular as well as equilateral...does it indeed follow, or is there a counterexample?","['geometry', 'group-theory']"
1036213,Can a non-zero vector field have zero divergence and zero curl?,"I don't see how. Curl and divergence are essentially ""opposites"" - essentially two ""orthogonal"" concepts. The entire field should be able to be broken into a curl component and a divergence component and if both are zero, the field must be zero. I'm visualizing it like a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$. A vector cannot have a zero $x$ component and a zero $y$ component and still be non-zero.

1036745,Proof of holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula using currents in Griffiths and Harris,"I am trying to understand the proof of the Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed point formula on page 426 in Griffiths and Harris.  However, I find their use of currents extremely confusing.  They seem to go back and forth between currents and forms without a thought, which is confusing to me as I don't know much about currents. Definitions: given a manifold $M$ and a smooth $p$-form $\phi$, the current induced by $\phi$ is the linear functional $T_\phi:\Omega^{n-p}_c(M)\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $T_\phi(\omega)=\int_M\phi\wedge\omega$.  Here $\Omega^{n-p}_c(M)$ denotes compactly supported smooth $(n-p)$-forms.  A current $T$ restricts to an open subset $U$ by extending a compactly supported form $\omega$ on $U$ by $0$ and then applying $T$.  In my case I am interested in complex currents, which are defined analagously with respect to Dolbeault cohomology. As best as I can tell, the situation is that we have we have a compact manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, a compact submanifold $A$ of dimension $k$, and smooth currents $T_\phi$ and $T_\psi$ where $\phi$ and $\psi$ are closed smooth $k$-forms on $M$.  It seems they are implicitly using that if $T_\phi$ restricted to a coordinate neighborhood $U$ of $M$ is zero, then $\int_A\phi=\int_{A-U}\phi$, and further if $T_\phi=T_\psi$ on an open set $W$ such that $A - U \subset W$ then $\int_{A-U}\phi=\int_{A-U}\psi$. Do the statements above make sense?  Are they true? Or do Griffiths and Harris mean something else?  (Note I have used somewhat different notation than they used to not clutter this question.  ) BOUNTY:  I'm setting a bounty for someone who can give a satisfactory explanation as to why, in the notation of the book, $$\int_{\Gamma_f}\phi=-\int_{\Gamma_f-\cup B_\epsilon(p_\alpha,p_\alpha)} \bar\partial k$$ This could mean proving or giving a reference to the two statements I stated above, of if those statements are not correct, then proving the above equality using the information given on page 426. UPDATE:  It seems that Poincare duality for noncompact manifolds implies by the hypotheses that on $U$, $\phi=0$ up to an exact form, and on $W$, $\phi=\psi$ up to an exact form.  However, $A-U$ will have boundary.  So I still haven't solved the problem.","['differential-forms', 'complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

1036834,On the average length of the Steiner net for $n$ randomly chosen points in the unit square,"$n$ points are randomly chosen in the unit square with respect to the uniform measure. What is the average length $L$ of the associated Steiner net (tree of minimum length through each of the $n$ points)? Heuristics show that we may expect something like $C\cdot\sqrt{n}$: a sub-optimal net is achieved by considering a square spiral with width $\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ and connecting every point with the closest point of the spiral. Another natural approach is to consider the boundary of the convex envelope, remove it, consider the boundary of the convex envelope of the remaining points and so on. Divide-and-conquer approaches looks interesting, too. However, despite the fact that $L\ll\sqrt{n}$ is straightforward to prove, I have not managed to prove that $L\geq D\cdot\sqrt{n}$, neither
$$ L\sim C\sqrt{n} $$
with an explicit constant $C$. Update : By the asymptotics on the EMST by Micheal Steele and the fact that the Steiner net is longer than a constant times the length of the minimum spanning tree, we have the double inequality
$$ A\sqrt{n} \leq L \leq B\sqrt{n}$$
with $B\leq\frac{5}{2}$ by my previous construction. It remains to prove that:
$$ L\sim C\sqrt{n}$$
for some explicit constant $C$.","['geometry', 'inequality', 'probability']"

Perhaps more interestingly, it seems that applying successive $\log$ terms to the integral \begin{align}

For $ x\in U_{1}\cap U_{2} $ there exists an open affine subscheme $V $ such that $ x\in V\subset U_{1}\cap U_{2} $ and $ V $ is distinguished in both $ U_{1}$ and $ U_{2 }$. Distinguished here means it has the form $ D(f )$ for some $f \in A_1 $ and similarly for $A_2$. The proof picks $f\in A_1$ such that $x\in D(f) \subset U_{1}\cap U_{2} $. Then replaces $U_1$ with $D(f)$ and considers the homomorphism $\varphi $ induced by the inclusion $U_1 \to U_2$. It then picks $g\in A_{2} $ such that $x\in D(g) \subset U_1$. All understood up to this point. It then claims $D(g) = D(\varphi(g))$. Since both are open subsets of the same scheme, it is sufficient to show that they are the same subset. To show this, the proof just shows that $\varphi^{-1}(D(g)) = D(\varphi(g))$. This is the part I don't understand. Why is this sufficient? Don't we have to show inclusions in both directions?

1037361,Confusions about Radon-Nikodym derivative and dominating measures,"I have some difficulties to understand the Radon-Nikodym derivative and link it to the ordinary way of obtaining the probability density function, which is through the derivative of  cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.). How can one intuitively link the Radon-Nikodym derivative to the non-measure theoretical definition of probability density function? I think I need to be more clear here. If we have a c.d.f. then even if it is discontinuos, one can take the derivative and at discontinuous points we have dirac functions. How can one see this from Radon-Nikodym derivative point of view? It might be possible that the c.d.f. is almost nowhere differentiable I guess. Then we wont have a density. Is this case directly observable from Radon-Nikodym derivative point of view? (Radon-Nykodim Theorem) : Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ be a $\sigma$-finite measurable space with two measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ on it, where $\nu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure $\mu$. That is for every set $A\in\mathcal{F}$, $\mu(A)=0\Longrightarrow \nu (A)=0$. Then there exists a unique positive measurable function $f:\Omega\rightarrow [0,\infty)$, s.t. $$\nu(A)=\int_A f \mathrm{d} \mu\quad\forall A\in\mathcal{F}$$ Question1: My first question is about the definition of absolute continuity of one measure w.r.t. another. It is only required that if one of them gives zero for some set $A$, then the other must also give zero. It seems that it is enough for the density function to exist. How is this absolute continuity is linked to the absolute continuity of functions? I know that a function is absolutely continuous if it is differentiable and the derivative is then integrable. But I cannot link this to the definition in Radon-Nykodim derivative. Doeas the definition of measures fill the gap? Question2: Consider the set of probability measures $$\mathcal{Q}=\{Q:Q=(1-\epsilon)P+\epsilon H,\, H\in\mathcal{H}\}$$
  where $\mathcal{H}$ is the set of all probability measures, $P$ is a probablity measure which has a density $p$. Then, it seems there are some $Q\in\mathcal{Q}$, which are not absolutely continuous with respect to $P$. As long as I understood, this only says that those $Q$ cannot have a density with respect to $P$ but they can have a density function with respect to another measure right? At any case since $H$ can be any measure I think there must be some $Q$ which do not accept any density function at all? Especially, if $H$ has some abrubt changes. Am I wrong? Question3: Now consider the following set
  $$\mathcal{G}=\{g:D(g,f)\leq \epsilon\}\quad D(g,f)=\int g\log(g/f)\mathrm{d}\mu$$
  where $f$ and $g$ are some density functions. In this set it is now known that every density exists and therefore their corresponding probability measures were Radon-Nikodym differrentiable. Here is it true to say that every measure $G_1$ corresponding to $g_1\in \mathcal{G}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to another measure $G_2$ corresponding to $g_2\in \mathcal{G}$?, therefore any $G$ corresponding to $g\in \mathcal{G}$ is also absolutely continuous w.r.t. $F$ corresponding to the density $f$? How to compare the set given in Question 3 to the set given in Question 2 in terms of the existence of the densities and absolute continuity issues? My last question is a notational issue. In the papers I read they assume that $F$ and $G$ are absolutely continous w.r.t. some dominating measure e.g. $\mu=F+G$. Then I know that $f$ and $g$ exist but to use the same $\mu$ for every $G$? for examples when they define $D(g,f)=\int g\log(g/f)\mathrm{d}\mu$, there is only one $\mu$ but uncountable many number of $G$ and apperantly all of them has a density with respect to some measure, say $\phi_G$ but then who guarrantees that $\mu=\phi_G$ for all $G$. It seems I have alot of confusions. I hope you can help me to clarify these issues. Thank you very much for reading this post.

I then attempted x = t and y = sin($\pi*t\over2$), which didn't help. I'm having trouble finding which parametrization works (the integration should follow easy from there). Can some help out with the setup of the parameters? Thanks","['multivariable-calculus', 'line-integrals']"

1037565,"An identity $ \int_{\partial B(0,1)}u(x_0+aw)u(x_0+cw)$ with a harmonic function $u$","This is Question 2.18 from Gilbarg and Trudinger, chapter 2. We are given that $\Omega$ is open bounded smooth boundary. Now fix $x_0\in \Omega$ and a constant $c>0$ such that $B(x_0,c)\subset\subset \Omega$ . Next, given $u$ such that $\Delta u=0$ in $\Omega$ and another $2$ positive constants $a$ and $b$ such that $a<b<c$ and $b^2=ac$ . Then, the question asks us to prove the following simple and beautiful equation. $$ \int_{\partial B(0,1)}u(x_0+aw)u(x_0+cw)\,dSw=\int_{\partial B(0,1)}u^2(x_0+bw)\,dSw $$ My try: Define $$ v(w):=u(x_0+aw)u(x_0+cw)- u^2(x_0+bw)$$ If I can prove $v$ is harmonic, then by Mean Value Theorem I would be done, since $$ 0=v(0)=\int_{\partial B(0,1)} v(w)\,dSw$$ Hence, by $v\in C^2$ , I just compute $\Delta v$ and obtain that, after simplification, $$ \Delta v(w)=2b^2(\nabla u(x_0+aw)\cdot\nabla u(x_0+cw)-\nabla u(x_0+bw)\cdot\nabla u(x_0+bw)) $$ I can not go further from here.

1037629,Are there any disadvantages to working in the category of k-spaces as opposed to Top?,"Unlike the category Top of topological spaces with continuous maps as the arrows, the full subcategory of compactly generated spaces (k-spaces) is Cartesian closed. It seems like a very nice category of spaces, since every manifold, CW complex, first countable space, compact space, and locally compact space is a k-space. Is there any compelling reason to work in the larger category of topological spaces rather than restricting to k-spaces? For instance, are there any spaces of interest to ""topology-users"" such as analysts, physicists, engineers, applied mathematicians, etc. that are not k-spaces?","['general-topology', 'category-theory', 'algebraic-topology', 'soft-question']"
