56831,Is there an everywhere discontinuous increasing function?,"Does there exist a function $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is strictly increasing and discontinuous everywhere? My line of thought (possibly incorrect): I know there are increasing functions such as $f(x) = x$, and there are everywhere-discontinuous functions such as the Dirichlet function. I also know that when there is a discontinuity at a point $c$, there is a finite gap $\epsilon$ such that there are points $d$ arbitrarily close to $c$ such that $|f(d) - f(c)| > \epsilon$. This is where my thinking gets unclear - does it make sense to have a ""gap"" at every real number?","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

56854,on the adjointness of the global section functor and the Spec functor,"In fact, it is an exercise on Hartshorne, Ex 2.4 to the second chapter of it (p.79): Let $A$ be a ring and $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ be a scheme. Given a morphism $f:X\longrightarrow \operatorname{Spec} A$ , we have an associated map on sheaves $f^\sharp :\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec} A}\longrightarrow f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ . Taking global sections we obtain a homomorphism $A\longrightarrow \Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ . Thus there is a natural map $\alpha:\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{Sch}}(X,\operatorname{Spec} A)\longrightarrow \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{Rings}}(A,\Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X))$ . How to show that $\alpha$ is bijective? My approach is to construct an inverse for $\alpha$ . Starting from a ring hom $\phi :A\longrightarrow \Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ , and an affine covering $X=\bigcup_i \operatorname{Spec} B_i$ ,restricting $\Gamma (X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ to $\mathcal{O}_X (\operatorname{Spec}B_i)$ , we get maps $\phi_i:A\longrightarrow B_i$ , thus inducing $(f_i,f_{i}^{\sharp}):\operatorname{Spec}B_i\longrightarrow \operatorname{Spec} A$ . Then I want to glue these $\operatorname{Spec}B_i$ together to get a morphism $(f,f^\sharp):(X,\mathcal{O}_X)\longrightarrow (\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}A})$ . I get stuck here: I don't know how to glue them together and verify that $(f,f^\sharp)$ is independent of the covering $\{ \operatorname{Spec}B_i\}_i$ . Is my idea right?

56870,Family of measure that admits a continuous density,"This question is a generalization of an example provided in Absolute continuous family of measures . Consider a metric space $(X,\rho)$ with a Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal B(X)$. Consider a family of probability measures $K:X\times \mathcal B(X)\to[0,1]$ such that $x\mapsto K(x,B)$ is a measurable function for each $B\in\mathcal B(X)$ and $B\mapsto K(x,B)$ is a probability measure on $(X,\mathcal B(X)).$ When does exist such a measure $\mu$ such that $\mu(\cdot)\gg K(x,\cdot)$  for each $x\in X$ and

56883,Is this similarity between trees and vector space bases just a coincidence?,"A vector space basis is a set of vectors that span the space and is linearly independent. It is well-known that for finite dimensional vector spaces this is equivalent to: The set is minimal with respect to being a spanning set. The set is maximal with respect to being linearly independent. Every element of the vector space is uniquely represented as a linear combination of the basis' vectors. Now consider finite trees. A tree is defined as a set of edges (for some fixed vertex set) such that they connect the vertices (e.g. the tree is a connected graph) and the set is ""independent"" in the sense that there are no cycles. Again, this is equivalent to: The set is minimal with respect to the connectedness of the graph. The set is maximal with respect to the independence (any edge added would create a cycle). For every two vertices, there is a unique path between them in the tree. The similarity is very striking, I believe. My question is - is this simply a coincidence or part of a greater (category-theory?) connection I'm unaware of? And are there more instances in mathematics for sets having this ""minimal-maximal-unique"" set of defining properties?","['graph-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

56899,Elementary proof of the third Lie theorem,"I would like to understand a (not well known) proof due to G.M; Tuynman, of the third Lie theorem, which asserts that for any given finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathcal{G}$ there exists a (simply connected) Lie group $G$ whose Lie algebra is $\mathcal{G}$. The proof is similar to using the theorem of Ado, but requires some tools: 1) The notion of universal cover. 2) The fact that for a simply connected Lie group $G$ not only the first de Rham cohomology space $H^1(G)=\{0\}$ but also $H^2(G)=\{0\}$. My problem is: 1) To acquire quickly the concepts of algebraic topology: simple connectedness, universal covering, fundamental group ... 2) Review the fact that $H^2(G)=\{0\}$ (unfortunately, I do not have the book of Godement).
3) Understanding the example discussed in the Tuynman's paper http://ifile.it/hy0q139 Thanks for your help! I would like also to add, I get a copy , I find it excellent to deepen his knowledge of algebraic topology.
I ran on page 202 of the Godbillon book. This is the theorem Künneth that identifies the cohomology of product manifolds with the tensor product of their cohomologies: $$K : H(M)\otimes H(N)\rightarrow H(M\times N)$$
If $M$ is compact, $K$ is an isomorphism.
There are two things I can not understand, among others: 1) Godbillon consider $d=K^{-1}\circ\mu^\star$, where $\mu$ is the multiplication on the Lie group $G$, and $K$ is invertible, while the compactness is essential for $K$ to be an isomorphism?! 2) Godbillon theorem shows in his page 202, with $d$, if $G$ is connected then the smallest integer $q>0$ such that $H^q(G)\neq 0$ is odd. First, $G$ must be compact? Why $H^1(G)=0$? This is not a consequence of the above theorem where compactness is essential!","['lie-algebras', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

56926,Character Table From Presentation,"I've recently learned about character tables, and some of the tricks for computing them for finite groups (quals...) but I've been having problems actually doing it. Thus, my question is (A) how to finish the following question (I am ok with general techniques, I can work out the particulars of the calculations) and (B) any tricks that are helpful to do the following types of questions: The question is Let $G$ be the group of order 16 with the presenation
$$
\langle x,y | x^8=y^2 = 1, yxy^{-1} = x^3 \rangle
$$ Compute the conjugacy classes and construct the character table. I compute the conjugacy classes to be $\{id\}$ $\{x,x^3\}$ $\{ x^2,x^6 \}$ $\{x^4\}$ $\{x^5,x^7\}$ $\{xy,x^3y,x^7y,x^5y\}$ $\{y,x^2y,x^6y,x^4y\}$ So, I calculate that there are 7 conjugacy classes, so there are 7 representations. The trivial represenation is one, and there is another one given by the nontrivial representation of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \simeq G /\langle x\rangle$, i.e. $-1$ on the last two conjugacy classes and $1$ otherwise. So, now I need 5 squares to sum to 14, which must be $1^2+1^2+2^2+2^2+2^2$. So, there are still two more $1$-dimensional representations, so there should be another normal subgroup, so some playing around (is there a fast way to see this?) I the even powers of $x$ to be a normal subgroup, with quotient the Klein 4 group, so I can fill in the other 1 dim reps. Now, here is where I get stuck. How do I find a 2 dimensional representation? I assume that once I find one, I can just tensor the 1-dim reps to finish the character table? Is this the best way? I don't see an obvious way to write down a representation of $G$, so perhaps I should use induction? From what subgroup? Alternatively, I could use the quotient $G/\langle x^4\rangle$, which is a nonabelian group of order 8, so without much work I should be able to write down its character table, but do other groups with similar presentations that I will see still have this nice property that the center quotients to something simpler - and even if it did, how do I construct a higher dim representation in any other case if I dont recognize the quotient group as something I can explicitly write as a symmetry group of some shape?

Thanks. Edit: I have proved a one-dimensional version of this formula: $$\delta (g(x))=\sum _a \frac{\delta (x-a)}{\left|g'(a)\right|}$$ where $a$ goes through the zeroes of $g(x)$ and it is assumed that at those points $g'(a)\neq 0$ . the integral can be divided into into a sum of integrals over small intervals containing the zeros of $g(x)$ . In these intervals $g(x)$ can be approximated by $g(a)+(x-a)g'(a)=(x-a)g'(a)$ since $g(a)=0$ . Thus $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\delta (g(x)) \, dx=\sum _a \int _{a-\varepsilon}^{a+\varepsilon }f(x)\delta ((x-a)g'(a)) \, dx$$ Using the property $\delta (kx)=\frac{\delta (x)}{|k|}$ , it follows that $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\delta (g(x)) \, dx=\sum _a \frac{f(a)}{\left|g'(a)\right|}$$ This is the same result we would have obtained if we had written $\sum _a \frac{\delta (x-a)}{\left|g'(a)\right|}$ instead of $\delta (g(x))$ as a factor of the integrand.","['multivariable-calculus', 'distribution-theory', 'physics']"

56986,Differential forms on fuzzy manifolds,"This post will take a bit to set up properly, but it is an easy read (and most likely easy to answer); in any event, please bear with me. Question In the usual setting of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, differential forms are defined as follows: Definition 1 - Given an open subset $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, a smooth differential $p$-form on $U$ is a smooth function $\omega : U \mapsto \bigwedge^p(\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ such that $\omega = \sum_I{f_Ie_{i_1}^* \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}^*}$ for the smooth function $f_I$ on $U$ and the dual basis $\{e_{1}^*,\ldots,e_{n}^*\}$ of the basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ where $I = \{i_1,\ldots,i_p\} \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $i_1 < \cdots < i_p$.  The vector space of all $p$-forms on $U$ is denoted $\Omega^p(U)$.  The vector space $\Omega^*(U) = \bigoplus_{p \geq 0}{\Omega^p(U)}$ is the set of all differential forms on $U$. which can be lifted up to differential manifolds Definition 2 - Let $M$ be a smooth manifold.  The set $\Omega^p(M)$ of smooth differential $p$-forms on $M$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge^pT^*M$ and the set $\Omega^*(M)$ of all smooth differential forms on $M$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge T^*M$. Definition 2 is all well and good when one is dealing with ""standard"" differential manifolds $M$, i.e., $M$ is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, is it possible to define differential forms, along with other related concepts, on manifolds that are not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but rather homeomorphic to a more abstract topological vector space?  More specifically, can this be done on fuzzy topological vector spaces (see the background section/papers below for clarification) and hence on fuzzy differential manifolds?  If so, how? ""Answer"" My intuition is that differential forms can be defined for fuzzy differential manifolds and hence fuzzy topological vector spaces.  In fact, it looks like it, along with the supporting notions of sections, fiber bundles, and alternating multilinear maps, can be defined without explicitly worrying much about the ""fuzzy baggage"" associated with fuzzy manifolds/fuzzy spaces. Definition 3 - Let $X$ be a differentiable fuzzy manifold (see definition 17 below), $TX = \bigsqcup_{x\in X}T_xX$ the associated tangent bundle (see definition 18 below for the tangent space), and $T^*X$ the dual bundle to $TX$.  The set $\Omega^p(X)$ of smooth differential $p$-forms on $X$ is the set of smooth sections of the bundle $\bigwedge^pT^*X$. The same appears to be true for the local representation of a $p$-form Definition 4 - Let $X$ be a differentiable fuzzy manifold $(A,\phi)$ and fuzzy chart of $X$ at $x$ (see definition 16 below), where $x$ lies in the support of the fuzzy set $A$.  A $p$-form $\omega$ can be expressed in terms of its coordinate functions with respect to the basis $\{e_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}\}$ of $T^*X$, $i_1 < \cdots < i_p$, as $\omega = \sum_I{f_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}e_{i_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{i_p}}$, where $f_{i_1,\ldots,i_p}$ is a function on $A$. Background In the paper ""$C^1$ fuzzy manifolds"", Fuzzy Sets and Systems , vol. 54, pp. 99-106, 1993 (PDF link) , Ferraro and Foster introduced one possible realization of a ""fuzzy"" manifold: a differentiable manifold that is locally homeomorphic to open fuzzy sets living in a certain kind of fuzzy topological vector space.  More formally, Fuzzy Topological Space Definition 5 - Let $X$ be a set and $I$ the unit interval $[0,1]$.  A fuzzy set $A$ is characterized by a membership function $\mu_A$ which associates each point $x \in X$ with a membership grade $\mu_A(x) \in I$. Definition 6 - Let $k_c$ be the fuzzy set in $X$ with the membership function $\mu_{k_c}(x) = c$, $c \in I$, $x \in X$.  The fuzzy set $k_1$ corresponds to the set $X$ and the fuzzy set $k_0$ to the empty set. Definition 7 - Let $X$ be a set.  A fuzzy topology on $X$ is a family $\mathscr{F}$ of fuzzy sets in $X$ which satisfy the following conditions: (i) $k_0,k_1 \in \mathscr{F}$, (ii) if $A,B \in \mathscr{F}$ then $A \cap B \in \mathscr{F}$, (iii) if $A_j \in \mathscr{F}$ then $\bigcup_j{A_j} = \sup_j \mu_{A_j}(x) \in \mathscr{F}$, for finite $j$ and $x \in X$; we call $(X,\mathscr{F})$ a fuzzy topological space. Definition 8 - An open fuzzy set $A \in X$ is one in $\mathscr{F}$.  A closed fuzzy set is one whose compliment, i.e., $\mu_{A^c}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)$, $\forall x \in X$, is in $\mathscr{F}$. Fuzzy Topological Vector Space Definition 9 - A fuzzy point in $X$ is a fuzzy set with membership function $\mu_{y_\lambda}(x)$, $x \in X$, such that $\mu_{y_\lambda}(x) = \lambda$ for $x = y$ and $0$ otherwise. Definition 10 - Let $(X_1,\mathscr{F}_1)$ and $(X_2,\mathscr{F}_2)$ be two fuzzy topological spaces.  A mapping $f$ of $(X_1,\mathscr{F}_1)$ onto $(X_2,\mathscr{F}_2)$ is said to be fuzzy continuous if for each open fuzzy set $B \in \mathscr{F}_2$ the inverse image $f^{-1}(B)$ is in $\mathscr{F}_1$.  Conversely, $f$ is fuzzy open if for each $A \in \mathscr{F}_1$ the image $f(A)$ is in $\mathscr{F}_2$.  If $f$ is a bijective mapping that is both fuzzy continuous and fuzzy open, it is called a fuzzy homeomorphism. Definition 11 - Let $\{A_j\}$ be a finite family of fuzzy sets in a vector space $E$ over the field $K$ of real numbers.  The sum $A = \sum_j A_j$ of the family $\{A_j\}$ is the fuzzy set in $E$ that has membership function $\mu_A(x) = \sup_{\sum_j A_j}\min_j \mu_{A_j}(x_j)$, $x \in E$.  The scalar product $\alpha A$ of $\alpha \in K$ and $A \in E$ is the fuzzy set in $E$ with membership function $\mu_{\alpha A}(x)$, $x \in E$, given by: $\mu_{\alpha A}(x) = \mu_{A}(x/\alpha)$ for $\alpha \neq 0$ and $\mu_{\alpha A}(x) = \mu_{0_\lambda}(x)$ for $\alpha = 0$ where $0_\lambda$ is a fuzzy point at $0$ in $E$ with $\lambda = \sup_{y \in E}\mu_A(y)$. Definition 12 - A fuzzy topological vector space is a vector space $E$ over the field $K$ of real numbers, $E$ equipped with the fuzzy topology $\mathscr{F}$ and $K$ with the usual topology $\mathscr{H}$, such that the two mappings: (i) $(x,y) \mapsto x+y$ of $(E,\mathscr{F}) \times (E,\mathscr{F})$ into $(E,\mathscr{F})$ and (ii) $(\alpha,x) \mapsto \alpha x$ of $(K,\mathscr{H}) \times (E,\mathscr{F})$ into $(E,\mathscr{F})$ are fuzzy continuous. Fuzzy Manifold and Tangent Space Definition 13 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces.  Let $o(t)$ denote a function of a real variable $t$ such that $\lim_{t\to 0}o(t)/t = 0$.  A mapping $\beta$ is said to be tangent to 0 if given a neighborhood $W$ of $0_\delta$ (a fuzzy point), $0 < \delta \leq 1$, in $\mathscr{E}_1$ there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $0_\lambda$ (a fuzzy point), for every $\lambda$, $0 < \lambda < \delta$, in $\mathscr{E}_2$ such that $\beta(tV) \subset o(t)W$. Definition 14 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces endowed with a $T_1$ fuzzy topology (a $T_1$ fuzzy topological space is one where every fuzzy point is a closed fuzzy set).  Let $f : \mathscr{E}_1 \mapsto \mathscr{E}_2$ be a fuzzy continuous mapping.  $f$ is said to be fuzzy differentiable at a point $x \in \mathscr{E}_1$ if there exists a linear fuzzy continuous mapping $u$ of $\mathscr{E}_1$ into $\mathscr{E}_2$ such that $f(x+y) = f(x)+u(y)+\beta(y)$, $y \in \mathscr{E}_1$ where $\beta$ is tangent to $0$.  The mapping $u$ is called the fuzzy derivative $f$ at $x$ and $f$ is called fuzzy differentiable if it is fuzzy differentiable at every point of $\mathscr{E}_1$. Comment 1 - One can also define the fuzzy partial derivative in a manner analogous to Lang in $\S I.3$ of: S. Lang, Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds, New York City, NY, USA: Springer, 2002; a definition of fuzzy integration also follows from $\S I.4$, ibid. Definition 15 - Let $\mathscr{E}_1$ and $\mathscr{E}_2$ be fuzzy topological vector spaces.  A bijection $f$ of $\mathscr{E}_1$ into $\mathscr{E}_2$ is said to be a fuzzy diffeomorphism of class $C^1$ if it and its inverse $f^{-1}$ are fuzzy differentiable and $f'$ and $(f^{-1})'$ are fuzzy continuous. Definition 16 - Let $X$ be a set.  A fuzzy atlas of class $C^1$ on $X$ is a collection of pairs $(A_j,\phi_j)$ which satisfies the following conditions: (i) each $A_j$ is a fuzzy set on $X$ and $\sup_j \mu_{A_j}(x)$, $\forall x \in X$ (ii) each $\phi_j$ is a bijection defined on the support of $A_j$, i.e.,  $\{x \in X,\mu_{A_j}(x) > 0\}$, that maps $A_j$ onto an open fuzzy set $\phi_j(A_j)$ in some fuzzy vector space $\mathscr{E}_j$ and for each $l$ in the index set $\phi_j(A_j \cap A_l)$ is an open fuzzy set $\mathscr{E}_j$ (iii) the mapping $\phi_l \circ \phi_j^{-1}$ which maps $\phi_j(A_j \cap A_l)$ onto $\phi_l(A_j \cap A_l)$ is a $C^1$ fuzzy diffeomorphism for each pair of indices $j,l$. Definition 17 - Let $(X,\mathscr{F})$ be a fuzzy topological space.  Suppose there exists an open fuzzy set $A$ on $X$ and a fuzzy continuous mapping $\phi$ defined on the support of $A$, mapping $A$ onto an open fuzzy set $V$ in a fuzzy topological vector space $\mathscr{E}$.  $(A,\phi)$ is said to be compatible with the fuzzy atlas $\{(A_j,\phi_j)\}$ if each mapping $\phi_j \circ \phi^{-1}$ of $\phi(A \cap A_j)$ into $\phi_j(A \cap A_j)$ is a fuzzy diffeomorphism of class $C^1$.  Two fuzzy $C^1$ atlases are compatible if each fuzzy chart in one atlas is compatible with each fuzzy chart of another atlas; this relation of compatibility between $C^1$ fuzzy atlases is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of $C^1$ fuzzy atlases on $X$ is said to define a $C^1$ fuzzy manifold on $X$. Comment 2 - As an aside, it appears one can modify Hirsch's arguments in Lemma 2.8 and Theorem 2.9 (M. W. Hirsch, Differential Topology, New York City, NY, USA: Springer, 1976) to show that every $C^1$ fuzzy manifold is $C^1$ fuzzy diffeomorphic to a $C^\infty$ fuzzy manifold. Definition 18 - Let $X$ be a fuzzy manifold.  Consider the triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ and $(A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$; here $(A_1,\phi_1)$ is a fuzzy chart at $x$ in $X$ with $v_\lambda$ being a fuzzy point of the fuzzy vector space in which $\phi(A_1)$ lies and $(A_2,\phi_2)$ and $w_\lambda$ are defined similarly.  These pair of triples are related, denoted by $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$, if the fuzzy derivative of $\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1}$ maps $v_\lambda$ into $w_\lambda$, i.e., $(\phi_2 \circ \phi_1^{-1})'(\phi_1(x))v_\lambda = w_\lambda$; this relation $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda) \sim (A_2,\phi_2,w_\lambda)$ is an equivalence relation.  An equivalence class of triples $(A_1,\phi_1,v_\lambda)$ is called a tangent vector of the fuzzy manifold $X$ at $x$ and the tangent space $T_x(X)$ at $x$ is the set of all tangent vectors at $x$. Comment 3 - As usual, $T_x(X)$ can be given the structure of a vector space. For further discussion about the above terms, e.g., fuzzy derivatives, it is advisable to consult: M. Ferraro and D.

  from the fact that
  dual distributes over tensor product (which again comes down to

57249,Path-type description for (faces of) associahedra?,"Recall that faces of associahedra are indexed by planar trees aka configurations of non-interesecting diagonals in polygons. And incidence corresponds to contracting edges / removing diagonals. Vertices of associahedra can also be indexed by Dyck paths. What is the corresponding interpretation for all faces? How can incidence be described in these terms? Some thoughts. Actually, I'm quite sure that faces are indexed by (small) Schröder paths . Heuristic explanation: edges correspond to “elementary switches” and the most natural transformation one can do to a Dyck path is to switch RU<->UR (R standing for a step right, U — for a step up, naturally); let's mark the place of switches by diagonal steps — now we get Schröder paths (small Schröder paths, actually: diagonal steps can't lie on the main diagonal — or the “UR end” of the switch would intersect the main diagonal). Note that this heuristic also describes the incidence relation — but this description is clearly wrong: it predicts that the vertex $R^nU^n$ lies only on one edge (namely, on the $U^{n-1}DR^{n-1}$). Recall that bijection between non-associative products and Dyck paths is given by Reverse Polish notation — so swtiches should correspond not to corners but just to vertical steps (and the symmetry between horizontal and vertical steps breaks). Anyway, now it's not hard to write down some examples. For 2-associahedron aka pentagon, say: the cyclic order of vertices coming from
$$((ab)c)d\to (a(bc))d\to a((bc)d)\to a(b(cd))\to (ab)(cd)\to$$
is
$$RURURU\to RRUURU\to RRURUU\to RRRUUU\stackrel{(!)}\to RURRUU\to $$

57279,Question about all the homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}$,"An exercise in ""A first course in Abstract Algebra"" asked the following:
Describe all ring homomorphisms from the ring $\mathbb{Z},+,\cdot$ to itself. I observed that for any such ring homomorphism the following has to hold: $$\varphi(1) = \varphi(1\cdot 1) = \varphi(1) \cdot \varphi(1)$$
In $\mathbb{Z}$ only two numbers exists so that their square equals itself: 0 and 1. When $\varphi(1) = 0$ then $\varphi = 0$ hence $\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}$: $\varphi(n) = \varphi(n \cdot 1) = \varphi(n) \cdot \varphi(1) = \varphi(n) \cdot 0 = 0$. Now, when $\varphi(1) = 1$ I showed that  $\varphi(n) = n$ using induction Base case: $n = 1$, which is true by our assumption Induction hypothesis: $\varphi(m) = m$ for $m < n$ Induction step: $\varphi(n) = \varphi((n-1) + 1) = \varphi(n-1) + \varphi(1) = n-1 + 1 = n$ Now I wonder whether you could show that $\varphi(n) = n$ when $\varphi(1) = 1$ without using induction, which seems overkill for this exercise. EDIT:
Forgot about the negative n's.
Since $\varphi$ is also a group homomorphism under $\mathbb{Z},+$, we know that $\varphi(-n) = -\varphi(n)$. Thus,

The direction $\Leftarrow$ indeed follows by induction, it suffices to do the case $n=2$. Indeed if $X_{1},X_{2}$ are $\sigma$ compact and $X_{1}=\cup C_{n}$, $X_{2}=\cup D_{n}$ now $X_{1} \times X_{2}$ = $\cup C_{n} \times \cup D_{n}$.

For the other direction, suppose $I$ is infinite and suppose $\prod X_{i} = \cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} C_{n}$ where each $C_{n}$ is a compact subset of $\prod_{i \in I} X_{i}$. Denote the projection by $p_{n}$ then $p_{n}(C_{n})$ is a compact subset of $X_{i}$. Since $X_{i}$ is not compact then $X_{i} \setminus p_{n}(C_{n})$ is non-empty, so for each $i \in I$ pick $z_{i} \in X_{i} \setminus p_{n}(C_{n})$, then $(z_{i}) \in \prod_{i \in I} X_{i}$, but not in the union $\cup C_{n}$, OK?","['general-topology', 'compactness', 'product-space']"

The algorithm draws these candidates from the array of prime numbers it has been constructing, which at any given iteration contains the primes between $2$ and $p_n$ inclusive, so there is an implicit assumption is that $\sqrt j \le p_n$ (the algorithm iterates over the array of primes up to $p_n$ with the only termination conditions being $d|j$ or $d > \sqrt j$, so if $\sqrt j$ could be $\ge p_n$ we risk reading past the end of the array). Quoting Dijkstra: In all humility I quote Don Knuth's comment on an earlier version of this program, where I took this fact for granted: ""Here you are guilty of a serious omission!

$$g(x)=\begin{cases}
  f(x)& x\in (A-B) \\ 
  x& \text{otherwise} \\

57450,$u$-substitution integral,"I have the following integral: $$\int_0^{y_c} e^{-y} e^{-a e^{-y}}y^2 \operatorname dy$$ My first attempt at solving in Mathematica was fruitless (I did not try using any assumptions though). However, I think I can do it by hand when I make the substitution:
$u = e^{-y}$ which means $\operatorname du = -e^{-y}dy = -u\operatorname dy$, and $y = -\ln u$.
The integral then becomes $$-\int_1^{e^{-y_c}} u e^{-a u}(\ln u)^2 \frac{\operatorname du}{u} = -\int_1^{e^{-y_c}} e^{-a u}(\ln u)^2 \operatorname du$$
Mathematica can then perform the integral in terms of exponential integrals and hypergeometric function. Does it look like I've performed the $u$-substitution correctly?","['calculus', 'integration']"

57479,Let $X$ and $Y$ be countable sets. Then $X\cup Y$ is countable,"Since $X$ and $Y$ are countable, we have two bijections: (1) $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ ; (2) $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow Y$. So to prove that $X\cup Y$ is countable, I figure I need to define some function, h: $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow X\cup Y$ Thus, I was wondering if I could claim something similar to the following: since we have (1) & (2) it follows that we also have the bijections $\alpha : \{n\in \mathbb{N} : n = 2k + 1, k\in \mathbb{N}\} \rightarrow X$; $\beta : \{n\in \mathbb{N} : n = 2k, k\in \mathbb{N}\} \rightarrow Y$; because we have bijections from $\mathbb{N}$ to the evens and odds respectively. Then define $h := \alpha$ for odd $n$, $h := \beta$ for even $n$. Thus, since $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}$(either $n$ is even or $n$ is odd but not both) $h$ is a bijection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $X\cup Y$. Thanks for reading, and for answering if you answer. I'm just really unsure if my logic holds here, or if I'm even approaching this right because I've been stuck on this problem for a little while today. p.s sorry for asking so many questions recently, I'm trying to study on my own and apparently I get confused and stuck more easily than I thought I would without a teacher. EDIT: (1) fixed the even and odd. 
(2) I do mean countably infinite. My bad, going through some notes I found online they were using the notation of ""countable"" for what you call ""countably infinite"", and ""at most countable"" for what you called ""countable""
(3) Thanks for the good answers, I do see now that this makes breaks down when they are not disjoint, but at least I'm not too far off.","['cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory']"

57488,"How does an integrating factor geometrically ""uncurl"" a vector field?","We know that certain 1-D forms $m(x,y,z)\,dx + n(x,y,z)\,dy + p(x,y,z)\,dz$ admit integrating factors as we teach in basic differential equations. How does the integrating factor geometrically turn this ""unlayered"" situation into the ""layered situation"" of level surfaces with the new vector field being the gradient field of of a suitably differentiable function $f(x,y,z)$ of $3$ variables.  I know that the general question of integrability is very complicated. Just a good intuitive example would suffice. I know how an integrating factor which is essentially a continuous ""reweighting"" of the vector field can make the required the field ""exact"" algebraically . What I want to get a feel for is ""What is happening geometrically ?"". How is a vector field which is wandering around and many times trying to form closed loops and does not ""layer"" transformed geometrically into a vector field which is inwardly or outwardly directed by the ""layered"" set of level surfaces when before there were no natural surfaces to assign to the vector field?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
