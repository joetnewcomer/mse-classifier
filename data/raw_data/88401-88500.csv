1187358,Calculating arc length $y=x^2$,"I picked this example for practice and got stuck with it. Someone moderate me if I am in the right path. I need to calculate the length of arc s, on the section of the curve $y=x^2$ with $0≤x≤1$ My Workings:
The formula is $s=\int^b_a\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx$ I work out everything under the $\sqrt{}$ my $f(x) =x^2$. I need to get $f'(x)$, which =$2x$ So our function becomes $s=\int^1_0\sqrt{1+[2x]^2}dx$ Then I work out $1+[f'(x)]^2 = 1+4x^2 $ $s=\int^1_0\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx =\int^1_0\sqrt{(1+4x^2)}dx$ $s=\int^1_0\sqrt{(1+4x^2)}dx =\int^1_0(1+4x^2)^\frac{1}{2}dx$ I reckon I have to integrate $\int^1_0(1+4x^2)^\frac{1}{2}dx$ The integration part: I used u-substitution: let $ u = 1+4x^2$ then $du = 8x dx$ hence $dx = \frac{du}{8x}$ But, now there is trouble with the $8x$ because if I plug in $dx$, I get: $\int^1_0(u)^\frac{1}{2}\frac{du}{8x} = \int^1_0\dfrac{(u)^\frac{1}{2}}{8x}du$ $= \dfrac{1}{8}\int^1_0\dfrac{1}{x}.{(u)^\frac{1}{2}}du$ Doesn't this give me $(\dfrac{1}{8}.ln|x|.\dfrac{2}{3}.u^\frac{3}{2})]^1_0$ ...but... my answer doesn't look right......shouldnt' $x >0$?

  $$f(z) = \frac{1}{(z - a)^3}\ \tanh z $$ What I'm confused about is the ambiguity surrounding $a$. Indeed, there is a pole of order 3 at $a$, but since $a$ isn't clearly defined, couldn't $a$ assume a value whereby there's a pole in $\tanh z = \frac{sinh\, z}{cosh\, z}$, in addition to the pole already caused by the $\frac{1}{(z-a)^3}$ term? Initially, I just assumed I could use the residue derivative formula, but even then, things get a bit hairy with the second derivative of $\tanh z$. Should I just assume that $a$ never achieves a value that would put a pole in the denominator of $\tanh z$ and use the derivative formula to compute the residue of a third order pole at $a$?","['residue-calculus', 'hyperbolic-functions', 'complex-analysis']"

1187637,The existence of the $n$th derivative at $c$ presumes the existence of the $(n-1)$st derivative in an interval containing $c$,"The following is from Introduction to Real Analysis by Bartle. If the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f$ exists at every point $x$ in an interval $I$ containing a point $c$, then we can consider the existence of the derivative of the function $f'$ at the point $c$. In case $f'$ has a derivative at the point $c$, we refer to the resulting number as the second derivative of $f$ at $c$ and we denote this number by $f''(c)$. In similar fashion we define the third derivative $f^{(3)}(c)$, and the nth derivative $f^{(n)}(c)$, whenever these derivatives exist. It is noted that the existence of the $n$th derivative at $c$ presumes the existence of the $(n-1)$st derivative in an interval containing $c$ , but we do allow the possibility that $c$ might be an endpoint of such an interval. My question is, does the existence of the $n$th derivative necessarily guarantee that the $(n-1)$st derivative exists in an interval containing $c$? I understand that $c$ must be an accumulation point in the domain of the $(n-1)$st derivative, but I don't see why the domain necessarily have to be an interval. For instance, $f(x)=x^2$ defined on ${\frac{1}{n}|n\in \mathbb{N}}\cup {0}$ has a derivative at $0$ but the domain is clearly not an interval.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

To tackle this, define  $f_1(x)=x$ and $f_{n+1}(x)=x^{f_n(x)}$ for $x \ge 1$ and $n\ge1$. a) Show that $f_{n+1}(x) \ge f_n(x)$ for all $n\ge1$. b) When $L(x) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)$ exists, find an equation for $L(x)$.
Use it to find an upper bound for $x$. c) For these values of $x$, show by induction that $f_n(x)$ is bounded above by $e$ for all $n\ge1$. What can you conclude? d) What happens for larger $x$? I'm having trouble showing it is increasing for a). I solved b) with the fact that $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(x)=L(x)=x^{L(x)}\implies x=L(x)^{\frac{1}{L(x)}}$ Maximizing on $L>0$: $$\frac{d}{dL}L^{1/L}=\frac{d}{dL}e^\frac{\ln(L)}{L}=\frac{d}{dL}\left(\frac{\ln(L)}{L}\right)e^\frac{\ln(L)}{L}$$
$$=\frac{1-\ln(L)}{L^2}L^{\frac{1}{L}}=L^{\frac{1}{L}-2}(1-\ln(L))$$
$$=-L^{\frac{1}{L}-2}(\ln(L)-1)=0\iff\ln(L)-1=0 \text{ so } L=e$$ Therefore $\max\{L^{1/L}\}$ happens when $L=e$ so $x\le e^{1/e}$ and I now have bounds for $x$ It then follows for c): Since $f_n$ is increasing on $[1,e^{1/e}], \max\{f_n(x)\}=f_n(e^{1/e})$ Base case: $f_1(x)=x\le e^{1/e}<e$. Assume $f_n(x)<e$, consider $x^{f_n(x)}\le x^e$
$\implies f_{n+1}(x)\le f_{n+1}(e^{1/e})<x^e<(e^{1/e})^e=e$

1188196,How can the centers of these 5 related circles be specified as a formula?,"This is my first time posting in this forum, so please forgive me if my question is too involved or if I've posted it in the wrong area. I hope someone finds it interesting enough to try their hand at it. Considering the image below, I am trying to work out a set of formulas that will specify either the radii or the center points for the five unknown single-colored circles. If I can determine either the radii or the center points for the particular five circles that I'll describe below, then I believe I can easily determine all of the remaining points of intersection in the drawing. In case the picture doesn't show up inline, or if you want to open it in another window so you can see it while you read the rest of the problem, here are a few different links to it: https://i.sstatic.net/VbFdk.png https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Z0g0E9vLRARDFRcUdRVU1UN2c/view https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EUiU3InO9qy-se2WGa1-DCAGs50K5ICtbE_GGWm578OaQjmOL3I9tHWjhCV1dge4eZsYrA_PZzU=w1142-h814 Regarding the drawing, the following facts are given: 1) All 4 corners of the bounding rectangle are 90 degrees. 2) The lower left corner is considered to be the origin (0,0). 3) The lower edge is 1 unit in length. 4) The Red quarter-circle has its center at (0,0) and a radius of 1. 5) The center of the Purple and Blue circles are on the Y axis. 6) The centers of the Orange and Yellow circles are on the vertical line defined by X=1. 7) All of the circles are tangent to one another wherever they appear to be so in the drawing. (This isn't a visual trick. They aren't 'just close'.) 8) Similarly, all of the straight lines shown are between centers of various circles and are either tangent or normal to the circles wherever they appear to be so. (Again, this isn't a trick question.) 9) The Green circle and the Blue and Yellow Half circles are all tangent to the top of the bounding rectangle, just as they appear to be. Since the center and radius of the Red circle are both given, the problem consists of determining the center and/or radius of the remaining Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple circles (or partial circles). The remaining straight lines and multi-colored circles are given as additional geometric hints, showing for example that the points of tangency for any three of the mutually tangent circles in question will always fall on a multi-colored circle whose center is at the intersection of the lines that bisect the angles formed by the centers of the respective circles. Now that's a lot of words for one sentence, so let me try to break it down and explain one case as an example. Consider the mutually tangent Purple, Green and Orange circles. The triangle drawn between their centers, intersects each of them at their respective points of tangency. The three lines that bisect the three corners of that triangle will necessarily intersect at a common point. That point of intersection is the center of the  multi-colored Purple/Green/Orange circle that overlaps the original three. Furthermore, lines drawn from the center of this new circle to the three original points of tangency are also tangent to the original circles at the same points of tangency shared by each pair of original circles. Finally, the resulting triangles are necessarily all right triangles! When all of the circles and arcs are removed from the drawing, what remains is a set of 35 right triangles that completely fill the outer rectangle. These triangles can be grouped by the color of the circle that originally generated them: 4 are Red (16 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 7 are Orange (14 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 6 are Purple (12 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 10 are Green (10, and it is the only single colored full circle.) 4 are Yellow (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) 4 are Blue (8 if it was repeated to form a full circle.) Another interesting point. The top of the Orange and Purple circles may initially appear to be at the same height. In fact, they are not. It turns out that they can't be the same if all of the other rules are met. They just happen to be close. Actually, if the Blue, Green and Yellow circles were taken out of the picture and the rectangle shortened and the Purple and Orange circles resized slightly so that their tops were both at the same level, then the problem is very simple to solve for just those two circles. It's only when the three remaining circles are added to the top as I have shown that the problem gets just past the edge of my ability. Although I don't want to expound on it here, I have actually build a spreadsheet that reflects nearly all of the mutual dependencies, but since the spreadsheet can't have circular references, it ultimately ends up with two different independent forks or branches of calculations and the only way I have been able to solve it is to set one cell equal to the difference between the final equations on each branch. This difference represents the cumulative error between the branches using the baseline estimated angles. I then have Excel apply successive approximation - using ""What-if"" - to adjust the approximated values until the error becomes as nearly zero as possible. This approach gets me close enough for the practical purpose of drawing it here, but it still leaves my original question unanswered. To reiterate: How can I derive a formula that exactly defines either the radii or the center points for each the five circles I've specified? One final note, I suspect that this may end up requiring a calculus solution. If so, it's over my head (for now). I'll still appreciate any responses, but I'm hoping for a solution that I can follow using just geometry, trig and algebra. A compass and straight-edge solution, in the unlikely case that it's even possible, would be really cool, but probably wouldn't answer my real question.

I wish to compute $\int_{S^n} \omega$ to conclude that it is not exact (by finding that integral to be not $0$ and applying Stokes' theorem). As the definition of integral via partitions of unity is not exactly practical to compute explicitly, I tried using spherical coordinates to parametrize $S^n$: $\Phi(\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n) = (\cos(\phi_1), \sin(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2), \ldots, \sin(\phi_1) \ldots \sin(\phi_{n-1}) \cos(\phi_n), \sin(\phi_1) \ldots \sin(\phi_n))$.

1188313,Right-continuity of the augmented filtration,"In most books about stochastic processes, the authors write about ""the usual augmentation of a filtration"". I am having trouble with proving that their construction is correct, i.e. that the augmented filtration is right-continuous. I will try to make this clear :
$\left(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P}\right)$ is a probability space with a filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$, i.e. an increasing family of sub-$\sigma$-algebras of $\mathcal{F}$. One defines the set $\mathcal{N}$ of negligibles (w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}_\infty$ and $\mathbb{P}$) by :
$$\mathcal{N}=\left\{N \subset \Omega : \exists C \in \mathcal{F}_\infty, \mathbb{P}(C)=0 \text{ and } N\subset C   \right\}$$
We say that the filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is complete if $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{F}_0$ (hence $\mathcal{N} \subset \mathcal{F}_t$ for any $t \in [0;+\infty]$). One can always complete a filtration by considering $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_t=\mathcal{F}_t \vee \mathcal{N}$ (where $\vee$ stands for ""$\sigma$-algebra generated by). On the other hand, $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is said to be right-continuous if, for any $t\in [0;\infty)$,
$$\bigcap_{s>t}\mathcal{F}_s=\mathcal{F}_t$$
In the same way as before, you can ""make a filtration continuous"" by considering $\mathcal{F}^+_t=\bigcap_{s>t}\mathcal{F}_s$ and $\mathcal{F}^+_{\infty}=\mathcal{F}_\infty$. The ""usual augmentation"" of $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in [0;\infty]}$ is obtained by first, making it right-continuous and then completing it, i.e. if we denote it by $\left(\mathcal{G}_t\right)$
$$\mathcal{G}_t=\overline{\left(\mathcal{F}^+_t\right)}$$ Now, it is claimed that this usual augmentation is complete (which I am fine with) and right-continuous, which, somehow, I cannot prove despite many efforts. I know that this question was already asked ( Right-continuity of completed filtration ) , but I think there is a mistake in its answer, which was accepted, so I thought that asking it again would be a good idea. edit : the last link now points to a correct answer.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory']"

If this function is onto, then let us consider the family $\{f^{-1}(x): x \in E\}$ of subsets of $\mathbb{N}$, where 
$f^{-1}(x):= f^{-1}(\{x\})$. Because $f$ is onto, $f^{-1}(x) \neq \emptyset \quad \forall x \in E.$ So for each $x\in E$, let us choose an integer $n_x \in \mathbb{N}$ with $f(n_x)=x$. We now define a map $g: E \to \mathbb{N}$ with assignment $g(x)=n_x$. Up to this point, I believe that I need to show that $g$ is one-to-one since we are already given a surjection from $\mathbb{N}$ to $E$; this would give us an injection and a surjection, and thus a bijection which will prove this direction. However, if $g$ is one-to-one, then $g(x) = g(y) \Rightarrow n_x = n_y$. Does this mean that the same integer $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is selected regardless of the input that depends on $x \in E$? How can this argument be improved? Many thanks in advance for your time and assistance.","['functions', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
1188764,Predictable martingales are constant,"Exercise: Let $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ be a predictable $\mathbb{F}$-martingale. Show that $X_n = X_0$

Solution: $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_0}$ being predictable means that $X_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable so $\mathbf{E}[X_n|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = X_n$ a. s. But using the martingale property we see that $\mathbf{E}[X_n|\mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = X_{n-1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. So we can conclude that $X_n = X_{n-1}$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and inductively that $X_n = X_0$ a. s. $\square$ Is this solution correct? Thank you!",['probability-theory']

A surprisingly hard problem for high schoolers,"An exam for high school students had the following problem: Let the point $E$ be the midpoint of the line segment $AD$ on the square $ABCD$. Then let a circle be determined by the points $E$, $B$ and $C$ as shown on the diagram. Which of the geometric figures has the greater perimeter, the square or the circle? Of course, there are some ways to solve this problem. One method is as follows: assume the side lengths of the square is $1$, put everything somewhere on a Cartesian coordinate system, find the midpoint of the circle using the coordinates of $E$, $B$ and $C$, then find the radius of the circle, and finally use the radius to calculate the circle's circumference and compare it to the perimeter of the square. The problem with that method is that ostensibly this problem is supposed to be very simple; it shouldn't require the student to know the formula for the midpoint of a circle given three coordinates. Therefore the question here is: does there exist a simple way to solve the problem without knowing any complicated geometric formulas?","['geometry', 'quadrilateral', 'circles']"
