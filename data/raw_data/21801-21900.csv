185936,Closing a subcategory under finite colimits by transfinite induction,"Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a locally small category with all finite colimits, and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a small full subcategory. I wish to prove the following: Proposition. There exists a full subcategory $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying these conditions: $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$ Finite colimits exist in $\mathcal{B}$ and are the same as in $\mathcal{C}$. Every object of $\mathcal{B}$ is a finite colimit of objects in $\mathcal{A}$. There is an obvious transfinite process that one can apply here. First, set $\mathcal{B}_0 = \mathcal{A}$. For each ordinal $\alpha$, let $\mathcal{B}_{\alpha + 1}$ be the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ obtained by adding to $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ any missing finite coproducts or coequalisers. For each limit ordinal $\lambda$, let $\mathcal{B}_\lambda = \bigcup_{\alpha < \lambda} \mathcal{B}_\alpha$. Question. Why does this transfinite process converge?
$\DeclareMathOperator{\ob}{ob}\DeclareMathOperator{\mor}{mor}$ It is easy to obtain an upper bound on the size of $\ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha$: by its very construction,
$$\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right| \le \sum_{n < \aleph_0} \left| \ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^n + \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^2$$
and if we assume $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is non-empty, the inequality $\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right| \le \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|$ then implies
$$\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right| \le \sup \left\lbrace \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^n : n < \aleph_0 \right\rbrace \le \left| \mor \mathcal{B}_\alpha \right|^{\aleph_0}$$
which, while elegant, is not too useful since we can't bound $\left| \mor \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right|$ in terms of $\left| \ob \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1} \right|$. It is conceivable that $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ are chosen in such a way that at each step $\alpha$, an object is added which vastly increases the size of $\mor \mathcal{B}_{\alpha+1}$. Nonetheless, I'm fairly confident the proposition is true. Adámek and Rosický even say that ""it is clear"" [LPAC, p. 17] (albeit with extra hypotheses on $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{C}$) and offer no proof.","['category-theory', 'cardinals', 'elementary-set-theory', 'combinatorics']"
185937,Two definitions of Lebesgue integration,"Normally, Lebesgue integral, for positive measures, is defined in the following way. First, one defines the integral for indicator functions, and linearly extend to simple functions. Then, for a general non-negative function $f$ , it is defined as the supremum of the integral of all simple functions less than or equal $f$. However, I find another definition in the book of Lieb and Loss, ""Analysis"". Let $f$ be the non-negative measurable function on a measure space $X$, let $\mu$ be the measure, and define for $t >0$,
$$S_f(t) = \{x \in X : f(x) >t\},$$
and
$$F_f(t) = \mu(S_f(t)) .$$ Note that $F_f(t)$ is now a Riemann integrable function. Now, the Lebesgue integral is defined as: $$ \int_X f \, d\mu = \int_0^\infty F_f(t) \, dt,$$ where the integral on the right-hand side is the Riemann integral. Here is the google books link to the definition. The book gives a heuristic reason why this definition agrees with the usual definition described here in the first paragraph. Now I would like to have a rigorous proof of the equivalence.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

It is not monotonic in general, so boundedness won't help. So, it seems as if I should show it's Cauchy. A wrong way to do this would be as follows (I'm on a mobile device, so I can't type absolute values. Bear with me.) $$\left|x_{n+1} - x_n\right| \leq \frac{1}{n^2}.$$ So, we have $$
\left|x_m -x_n\right| \leq \sum_{k=n}^{m} \frac{1}{k^2}$$ which is itself Cauchy, etc., etc. But, of course, I can't just use absolute values like that.

185991,Is the vector cross product only defined for 3D?,"Wikipedia introduces the vector product for two vectors $\vec a$ and  $\vec b$ as
$$
\vec a \times\vec b=(\| \vec a\| \|\vec b\|\sin\Theta)\vec n

It then mentions that $\vec n$ is the vector normal to the plane made by $\vec a$ and  $\vec b$, implying that $\vec a$ and  $\vec b$ are 3D vectors. Wikipedia mentions something about a 7D cross product, but I'm not going to pretend I understand that. My idea, which remains unconfirmed with any source, is that a cross product can be thought of a vector which is orthogonal to all vectors which you are crossing.  If, and that's a big IF, this is right over all dimensions, we know that for a set of $n-1$ $n$-dimensional vectors, there exists a vector which is orthogonal to all of them.  The magnitude would have something to do with the area/volume/hypervolume/etc. made by the vectors we are crossing. Am I right to guess that this multidimensional aspect of cross vectors exists or is that last part utter rubbish?","['vector-spaces', 'cross-product', 'linear-algebra', 'vectors']"

186035,Proof that all abelian simple groups are cyclic groups of prime order,"Just wanted some feedback to ensure I did not make any mistakes with this proof. Thanks! Since $G$ is abelian, every subgroup is normal. Since $G$ is simple, the only subgroups of $G$ are $1$ and $G$, and $|G| > 1$, so for some $x\in G$ we have $x\neq 1$ and $\langle x\rangle\leq G$, so $\langle x\rangle = G$. Suppose $x$ has either infinite order or even order. Then $\langle x^2\rangle \leq G$ but $\langle x^2\rangle \neq \langle x \rangle$, a contradiction. So $x$, and therefore $G$, has odd order, and by Feit-Thompson, $G\cong Z_p$ for some prime $p$. Edit: Thanks, I see that Feit-Thompson is too much. Since $G$ is abelian, every subgroup is normal. Since $G$ is simple, the only subgroups of $G$ are $1$ and $G$, and $|G| > 1$, so for some $x\in G$ we have $x\neq 1$ and $\langle x\rangle\leq G$, so $\langle x\rangle = G$. Suppose $x$ has infinite order. Then $\langle x^2\rangle \leq G$ but $\langle x^2\rangle \neq \langle x \rangle$, a contradiction. So $x$, and therefore $G$, has finite order. Suppose $x$ has composite order $n$ so for some $p > 1$ that divides $n$, $\langle x^p \rangle$ is a proper non-trivial subgroup of $G$, so $G$ is not simple. So $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order.","['abelian-groups', 'simple-groups', 'cyclic-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

  ...There are numerous useful integral transforms. Each is specified by a choice of the function $K$ of two variables, the kernel function or nucleus of the transform. I was wondering if the kernel function has to have any special properties in order for the integral transform to work . On the bottom of the Wikipedia page, it shows some of the common kernel functions such as $\frac{e^{-iut}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ and $e^{-ut}$ for the Fourier Transform and the Laplace Transform. However, as an example, with the kernel function $$ K(t,u)=\ln|t+u|,\space t_1=0,\space t_2=\infty $$ the integral transform would diverge for almost all $f(t)$. Or, for another example, the kernel function $$ K(t,u)=ut,\space t_1=-\infty,\space t_2=0 $$ also diverges for almost all $f(t)$. My thinking is that there has to be some certain property of the Fourier Transform and the Laplace transform that make it so they don't diverge for almost all $f(t)$. So, my basic question is whether a certain property has to hold in order for the integral transform to not diverge to infinity given any function $f(t)$.","['integral-transforms', 'integration', 'analysis']"

I couldn't find a way to make that work. Thank you! edit: For the record, here's why I asked about this special case of the more general result about fiber bundles over contractible spaces. In the much beloved book by Bott and Tu, it's claimed that the Leray Hirsch theorem can be proven in the same way the Kunneth theorem is proven:  induct on the size of a finite good cover for the base space, then apply the Mayer Vietoris sequence and the Poincare lemma for the induction step. It's assumed that there exists a finite good cover for the base space, but it's not assumed that this cover is a refinement of the cover of the base space, which gives the local trivializations of the fiber bundle. Therefore, to apply the Poincare lemma in the induction step, it seems that you need to know that the result I asked about is true. Since fiber bundles had just been introduced in the text, I thought there may be a short, elementary proof that the authors had taken for granted.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

186161,Roots of unity in non-Abelian groups: when do they form subgroups?,"I haven't studied group theory in earnest beyond first courses, so my notation may be nonstandard and my question may be a 'standard fact', so bear with me: Consider a group $G$, and for each natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ define
$$G_n := \{g \in G : g^n = 1\}$$
to be the set of $n^\text{th}$ roots of unity in $G$. If $G$ is Abelian, then each $G_n$ is a subgroup of $G$, but in general this may not be the case: for example, taking 
$$G = D_3 = \langle \sigma, \tau : \sigma^2 = \tau^3 = 1, \tau \sigma = \sigma \tau^2 \rangle,$$
we can compute that
$$ G_2 = \{1,\sigma,\sigma \tau, \sigma \tau^2\}$$

186201,What are the Eigenvectors of the curl operator?,"The curl operator $\vec\nabla\times\mathbb{1}$ can be written as a skew-symmetric 3x3 matrix $$\mathrm{curl} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -\partial_z & \partial_y \\ \partial_z & 0 & -\partial_x \\ -\partial_y & \partial_x & 0\end{pmatrix}$$ (in Cartesian coordinates). Since $\mathrm{curl}\,\mathrm{grad}=0$ and $\mathrm{div}\,\mathrm{curl}=0$, the Eigenvector 1 to the Eigenvalue 0 is $\vec\nabla$. And by calculating $\det(\mathrm{curl}-\lambda)\stackrel!=0=-\lambda(\lambda^2+\Delta)$ one obtains that the other two Eigenvalues (with opposite signs) both satisfy $\lambda_\pm^2=-\Delta$, i.e. they are the two roots of the negative Laplacian. Since $\mathrm{curl}^2=\mathrm{grad}\,\mathrm{div}-\Delta$, the Eigenvectors $\vec f_\pm$, satisfying $\mathrm{curl}^2\vec f_\pm = -\Delta\vec f_\pm$, they have a constant divergence. More precisely, since they must be orthogonal to $\vec\nabla$ due to the different Eigenvalues, they can be written as $\vec f_\pm = \vec g_\pm\times\vec\nabla$. Since the $\vec f_\pm$ are also orthogonal to each other, one can obtain $$\vec f_\pm = \pm\lambda_\pm^{-1}\,\vec f_\mp\times\vec\nabla$$ where the factor $\pm\lambda_\pm^ {-1}$ was chosen for symmetry and consistency. But what is an analytical (non-recursive) expression for them? You may already have noticed that the $\lambda_\pm$ are Dirac operators , so I wouldn't be too surprised if an answer included spinors and $\partial\!\!/$, even though that is in 4D... In fact, it is most likely that this is the case, since apart from $\vec\nabla$, the vector of $\gamma$ (or Pauli) matrices would not set any preferred direction. 1 In the sense that for any scalar function $s(\vec x)$, $\vec\nabla s$ is an Eigenvector of $\mathrm{curl}$ with Eigenvalue 0, i.e. $\forall s:\mathrm{curl}\vec\nabla s = 0\cdot\vec\nabla s$.

186249,Rigid-body matching algorithm and clustering algorithm with groups of lines in 3D,"I've been struggling with this problem for weeks, and couldn't find an appropriate algorithm to solve it. Could you guys please give me some advices or suggestions in addressing this question. Or if you know anyone who could answer this question, please send it to them. I really need the solution as I have been trying to figure it out for quite long time :| Many thanks! As can be seen in the picture below, I have more than 200 lines in 3D. They consist of 3 different groups of lines, and the common property of the lines in each group is that they pass close to the same point. However, in this problem, we don't know which line belongs to which group. What is given are only the 3D coordinates (x,y,z) of the 2 ends of all the lines. My job is to find an algorithm to match/fit/register a triangle (a rigid body) to those lines such that the sum of the sum of distances between 3 vertexes of the triangle and their corresponding lines is minimized. In some cases, one vertex may be the closest point in a group, but the other vertexes would be dragged further away from their corresponding lines (because they are in a rigid body), thus this sum will not be minimal. What I need is the best positions of the 3 vertexes (the best fit of the triangle) to minimize the global sum. In conclusion, given more than 200 sets of (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2) (which are coordinates of 2 ends of a line), I need to find the best positions of 3 vertexes of a triangle to fit in those lines (given the relative distance between the 3 vertexes). Without the rigid-body condition, I have successfully determined the positions of the 3 independent points using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. However, sometimes 2 or 3 points are assigned to the same position. Then, I realized I had forgotten the ""rigid-body"" condition. With this added condition, this error will not occur. In the EM algorithm, I can derive the formula for each repositioning step for each point. But when it comes to a rigid-body, I don't know how to figure out the translation and rotation matrix to fit the triangle to the lines. Thank you for reading this post. Your help would be greatly appreciated!","['optimization', 'geometry', '3d', 'algorithms']"
186259,Uniqueness of the random variable from its distribution [closed],"Closed. This question is off-topic . It is not currently accepting answers. This question does not appear to be about math within the scope defined in the help center . Closed 10 years ago . Improve this question Moderator's Note : This question has been put on hold due to the version over at MathOverflow having received better attention and produced an accepted answer. Interested readers are advised to visit the above link. When talking about a single random variable, knowing only its distribution, the construction of a probability space is quite easy. Namely, let $(X,\mathscr A)$ be a measurable space and let $\mathsf Q$ be some probability measure over this space which we refer to as a distribution of some random variable. The usual definition states that there is some probability space $(\Omega,\mathscr F,\mathsf P)$, the random variable is
$$
  \xi:(\Omega,\mathscr F)\to(X,\mathscr A)
$$
i.e. it is a measurable map, and its distribution is a pushforward measure: 
$$
\mathsf Q:=\xi_*(\mathsf P)
$$
i.e. $\mathsf Q(A) = \mathsf P(\xi^{-1}(A))$ for any $A\in \mathscr A$. Clearly, given $(X,\mathscr A,\mathsf Q)$ for a single random variable there is no reason to come up with a new sample space and we can take $(\Omega,\mathscr F,\mathsf P) = (X,\mathscr A,\mathsf Q)$ and $\xi:=\mathrm{id}_X$. Let us stick to this latter case. It may happen, that there is a map 
$$
  \eta:(X,\mathscr A)\to(X,\mathscr A)
$$
such that $\eta\neq\mathrm{id}_X$ but still it holds that $\mathsf Q = \eta_*(\mathsf Q)$. I wonder if the existence of this other maps is studied somewhere. The brief statement of the problem is thus the following: given a probability space $(X,\mathscr A,\mathsf Q)$ if the identity map $\mathrm{id}_X$ is the unique solution of the equation
$$
  \mathsf Q = \xi_*(\mathsf Q) \tag{1}
$$
where the variable $\xi$ is any measurable map from $(X,\mathscr A)$ to itself. As far as I am not mistaken, the space of solutions of $(1)$ is a monoid as it is closed under the composition of maps. Also, if $\xi$ is a bijection which solves $(1)$ then $\xi^{-1}$ solves it as well:
$$
\xi^{-1}_*(\mathsf Q)(A) = \mathsf Q(\xi(A)) = \mathsf Q(\xi^{-1}(\xi(A))) = \mathsf Q(A).
$$ Hence, solutions of $(1)$ which are bijection form a group - which may be thought of a group of ""symmetries"" of $\mathsf Q$, apparently. A small example just to add some clarity to the problem statement. If $X = \{a,b\}$, $\mathscr A = 2^X$ and $\mathsf Q(a) = 0.4$ then the solution is unique. However, if $\mathsf Q(a) = 0.5$ there are exactly two solutions. Indeed, there are exactly $4$ maps $\xi:X\to X$ namely
$$
\begin{align}
  \xi^1:(a,b) \mapsto (a,a) & &\xi^2:(a,b) \mapsto (a,b)
\\
 \xi^3:(a,b) \mapsto (b,a) & &\xi^4:(a,b) \mapsto (b,b)
\end{align}
$$
In the first case, the pushforwards are 
$$
\begin{align}
  \xi^1_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(1,0) & &\xi^2_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0.4,0.6)
\\
 \xi^3_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0.6,0.4) & &\xi^4_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0,1)
\end{align}
$$
and in the second case:
$$
\begin{align}
  \xi^1_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(1,0) & &\xi^2_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0.5,0.5)
\\
 \xi^3_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0.5,0.5) & &\xi^4_*(\mathsf Q) &= &(0,1)
\end{align}
$$
hence in the first case $(1)$ has the only solution $\xi^2$ which is of course $\mathrm{id}_X$, but in the second case both $\xi^2$ and $\xi^3$ solve the problem. Due to this reason, I expect a non-uniqueness of the solution to reflect some kind of symmetries in the distribution $\mathsf Q$. I posted the same question on MO .","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"
186261,The connection in terms of local trivialization,"I am having trouble to understand how one may write down the connection in terms of local trivialization of the vector bundle. Assume $\pi: E\rightarrow X$ is a vector bundle with rank $n$. A connection on $E$ is a map $$A:TE\rightarrow \pi^{*}E$$ such that $A$ is a splitting of the sequence $0\rightarrow \pi^{*}E\rightarrow TE\rightarrow \pi^{*}TX\rightarrow 0$ and commutes with multiplication by scalars. Here the map from $\pi^{*}E$ to $TE$ is defined by $$(e,v)\rightarrow (e,\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}(e+tv))$$ The author (Cliff Taubes) asserts that if we let $x_{i}$ be the $n$ corresponding trivialization functions $E_{U}\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{C}^{n}$ such that we have $$x(e)=(\pi(e),(x^{1}(e)...x^{n}(e))$$ Then the connection $A$ takes value in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ (viewed as a one form on $E$ with values in $\pi^{*}E$). So far I can follow since $\pi^{*}E$ has extra $n$ dimensions. But I feel at loss with the following assertion because I do not know how to construct an inverse to form a splitting map: Let $A^{a}$ be the coordinates, then we can write $$A^{a}=dx^{a}+A^{ab}x^{b}$$ Here $A^{ab}$ is a 1-form pulled back from $U$. We can think of $A$ as an End($\mathbb{C}^{n}$)valued 1-form on $U$. My questions are: 1): How do I get this formula? How should I interpret it in terms of the exact sequence? 2): How can I show any connection $A$ can written in this form, and any $A^{ab}$ defined on $U$ is suffice to define $A$? 3): There is a marked difference between this definition and the definition on wikipedia , for example in wikipedia connection is defined to be a map from sections to sections.

186277,Existence of smooth function $f(x)$ satisfying partial summation,"We know that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{i}=\psi_{0} (n+1)-\psi_{0} (1)$, where $\psi_{0}(x)$ is the digamma function. My problem is, (1).Is there a transformation such that it maps

When I mention transformation, I mean an operator or algorithm for me to get $g(x)$ from $f(x)$. (2). Surely $g(x)$ if exists, it is not unique because $g(x)+C$ also satisfy the condition. Let's take $g(x)+C$ and $g(x)$ as the same case. Is there another smooth $h(x)\not = g(x)+C$ satisfying this condition?

186286,Get Transformation Matrix from Points,"I have built a little C# application that allows visualization of perpective transformations with a matrix, in 2D XYW space. Now I would like to be able to calculate the matrix from the four corners of the transformed square. Here is a screenshot to help you understand what I am working with: The idea is to allow the user to move the corners of the square and update the matrix. The corners are currently located at (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1). Is there an algorithm that will calculate a 3x3 matrix given four 2D points? If I understand this correctly, every matrix corresponds to a set of four points, and every set of four points corresponds to one or more equivalent matrices ('equivalent' meaning 'producing identical transformations'). I searched for an algorithm to do this, but didn't have much luck. I figured out that I could do it by creating eight equations, one for each variable in the four points, and then setting one of the matrix values to one, and solving for the other eight with algebra. However, the equations grow much too complicated to do this all successfully on pencil and paper. This is the process I used to try to get it working. So this is the basic matrix transformation formula. $\begin{pmatrix}a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
g & h & i
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}ax+by+cz\\
dx+ey+fz\\
gx+hy+iz
\end{pmatrix}$ The resulting point is then converted from homogeneous to Euclidean coordinates. $\begin{pmatrix}x\\
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}$=$\begin{pmatrix}\frac{x}{z}\\
\frac{y}{z}
\end{pmatrix}$ So given a collection of points, we transform them like this. $\begin{pmatrix}a & b & c\\
d & e & f\\
g & h & i
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_{n}\\
y_{n}\\
z_{n}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}x'_{n}\\
y'_{n}
\end{pmatrix}$ These are the formulas used for the transformation. $x'_{n}=$$\frac{ax_{n}+by_{n}+cz_{n}}{gx_{n}+hy_{n}+iz_{n}}$ $y'_{n}=$$\frac{dx_{n}+ey_{n}+fz_{n}}{gx_{n}+hy_{n}+iz_{n}}$ We then define four base points, which are the corners of our square. $x'_{0}=1$ $y'_{0}=1$ $z'_{0}=1$ $x'_{1}=1$ $y'_{1}=-1$ $z'_{1}=1$ $x'_{2}=-1$ $y'_{2}=-1$ $z'_{2}=1$ $x'_{3}=-1$ $y'_{3}=1$ $z'_{3}=1$ This gives us the following system of equations, in the form that lets us determine the transformed points from the matrix. $x'_{0}=$$\frac{a+b+c}{g+h+i}$ $y'_{0}=$$\frac{d+e+f}{g+h+i}$ $x'_{1}=$$\frac{a-b+c}{g-h+i}$ $y'_{1}=$$\frac{d-e+f}{g-h+i}$ $x'_{2}=$$\frac{-a-b+c}{-g-h+i}$ $y'_{2}=$$\frac{-d-e+f}{-g-h+i}$ $x'_{3}=$$\frac{-a+b+c}{-g+h+i}$ $y'_{3}=$$\frac{-d+e+f}{-g+h+i}$ Now we want to reverse the transformation, and find the matrix that produces the above points. Since we have 9 unknowns and 8 equations, we need to add another equation. $i=1$ Now all that is left is to solve the system equations to find the formulas for the matrix values. I'm not patient enough nor good enough with algebra to do this myself, so I used an online calculator to solve the system of equations. The formulas it gave almost worked, but had some glitches with y-coordinates. I think this can be narrowed down to 2 questions: Are the above calculations wrong, or does the online calculator have a bug? Is there an easier algorithm for this?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'transformation', 'algorithms']"

I've also tried testing $G_t$ for convexity but this doesn't seem to work because of the conditioning part of the expectation. I've also tried numerous tests of random variable pairs which have all corroborated the positivity of $I_t$. So I'm expecting a slightly contrived counterexample if there is one.

186522,Seemingly similar but different probability games,"Burger King is currently running its ""family food"" game in which each piece can be modeled as a scratch off game where exactly one of three slots is a winner and you may only scratch one slot as your guess. As I was standing in line the other day I realized that their advertisement of ""make it a large to double your chances of winning"" (where large drinks/fries have two pieces on them) was actually not exactly true.  The real probability of having at least one winning with two tickets is $\frac{5}{9}$ rather than $\frac{2}{3}$ which would really be double the chance. This is because the probability of both losing is $\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}$ so the probability of at least one winning is $1-\frac{2}{3}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{9}$. Now this was all very clear to me but while I sipped my strawberry banana smoothie, I wondered why this game of two three-slot tickets where each one has one winner and you can scratch one from each is different from the game of a single six-slot ticket where there are two winning slots and you get two scratches.  The games must be different because the probabilities of winning are different.  The six-slot game has $1-\frac{4}{6}\times\frac{3}{5}=\frac{3}{5}$ chance of getting at least one win.  The two games seem the same to me intuitively. Can anyone explain how they are different?

Upon learning that vectors can be projected onto lines by a simple function, and that this function is a linear transformation, I recommended that we find a way to calculate the transformation matrix for the function. This function was characterized by a vector $\vec{v}$ pointing along the line to be projected onto.  The non-matrix form of the function we were given was this: $$proj_{\vec{v}}(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x} \cdot \hat{u})\hat{u}$$ where $\hat{u}$ is the normalized form of $\vec{v}$ calculated by ($\frac{1}{||\vec{v}||}\vec{v}$). When trying to construct this as a matrix, my friend came up with this (this is just for $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, but you get the idea): $$proj_{\vec{v}}(\vec{x}) = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} \vec{x} \cdot \hat{u} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \vec{x} \cdot \hat{u} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \vec{x} \cdot \hat{u} \end{array}\right] \cdot \hat{u}$$ I see multiple problems with this.  First of all, transformation matrices cannot be expressed in terms of the vector to be transformed, can they?  To my understanding, they are supposed to contain constant values that are the same no matter what vector is being transformed.  Second of all, linear transformations multiply $\vec{x}$ by the transformation matrix, not any other vector, right? I'm not particularly interested in the actual transformation matrix for this problem - I plan to get some practice with what i've learned by calculating that :) - I'd just like confirmation as to whether or not the things my friend has done are valid.

Two squares or circles are always similar but two rectangles are not necessarily similar, because for two rectangles to be similar, their ratios of lengths and breadths must be constant. So I suggested types of figure on the basis of their variables. As a circle or a square can be defined by a single variable, I called them single variable figures. For a rectangle, a rhombus, or an ellipse, we must have two variables, so I called them 2 variable figures. For random figure to be similar we must know by some means the length of the curve and maximum distance between any two points, and we will get a constant calling it $Figure_\pi$ My question is this: Am I thinking in the right direction or not, because I am finding different constants for different 2D figures as different variable figures?","['pi', 'geometry']"

Moreover, for $n\in\mathbb{N}_0:=\{0,1,2,\dots\}$, $\Pi_n[a,b]$ denotes the linear space of real algebraic polynomial functions of degree at most $n$ restricted to $[a,b]$. The following statement is well known as Chebyshev Equioscillation Theorem : $P\in\Pi_n[a,b]$ is a best approximation from $\Pi_n[a,b]$ to $f\in C[a,b]$, that is,
  \begin{equation}
 \|P-f\|_{C[a,b]}
  =\inf_{Q\in\Pi_n[a,b]}\|Q-f\|_{C[a,b]}
\end{equation}
  if and only if there exists an increasing sequence of points $x_i\in[a,b]$, $0\le i\le n+1$, and $\sigma\in\{-1,1\}$ such that
  \begin{equation}
 P(x_i)-f(x_i)
  =\sigma\ (-1)^i\|P-f\|_{C[a,b]}\text{,$\quad0\le i\le n+1$.}\tag{*}
\end{equation} Does a similar statement hold if $C[a,b]$ is replaced by $L_{\infty}[a,b]$? I am particularly interested in the case $n=1$ and the implication \begin{equation}
 \text{$P$ is a best approximation to $f$}\implies\text{A relation similar to (*) holds.}
\end{equation} Clearly, (*) cannot remain unchanged in the generalized setting for if $P\in\Pi_n[a,b]$ is a best approximation from $\Pi_n[a,b]$ to $f\in L_{\infty}[a,b]$ then $P$ is a best approximation from $\Pi_n[a,b]$ to each $g\in L_{\infty}[a,b]$ such that $\|g-f\|_{L_{\infty}[a,b]}=0$.","['measure-theory', 'polynomials', 'approximation-theory', 'reference-request', 'functional-analysis']"

186907,vector space without verification of the axioms,"I'm trying to show that the functions $c_1 + c_2 \sin^2 x + c_3 \cos^2 x$ forms a vector space. And I will need to find a basis of it, and its dimension. Is there a way how to do this without verifying the 8 axioms for a vector space, and if we let the set $X = \{c_1 + c_2 \sin^2 x + c_3 \cos^2 x\}$ then we note that $1 = \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x$, and this is enough. So the dimension is $2$.
Thanks. Can you please provide clarification on how the argument of the subspace of the vector space follows? I think you did it already by inspection, but its not very complete to me, can you please write it down? Thanks",['linear-algebra']

186918,"Morse functions are dense in $\mathcal{C}^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})$.","In Shastri's Elements of Differential Topology, p.210-211, there is written: Why do we get a Morse function $f_u$ on $X$? We know that for any $f\!\in\!\mathcal{C}^\infty(X,\mathbb{R})$, there is some $a\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^N$, such that $f_a(x)=f(x)\!+\!\langle x,a\rangle$ is a Morse function on $X$. Since $X$ is compact, the function $|\langle\_,a\rangle|$ attains its maximal value on $X$. Then, we define $$b := \frac{a\varepsilon}{\max_{x\in X}|\langle x,a\rangle|},$$ and we have $\sup_{x\in X}|f\!-\!f_b|=\sup_{x\in X}|\langle x,b\rangle|=\frac{\sup_{x\in X}|\langle x,a\rangle|}{\max_{x\in X}|\langle x,a\rangle|}\varepsilon=\varepsilon$. But why is this $f_b$ a Morse function on $X$? Its differential is $D(f_b)_p=D(f)_p+b$, so $p\!\in\!X$ is a critical point iff $D(f)_p\!=\!-b\!=\!-\frac{a}{\ldots}$. On the other hand, the critical points of $f_a$ are those for which $D(f)_p\!=\!-a$. I do not see how to make a conclusion here.","['differential-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
