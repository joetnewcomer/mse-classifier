1405460,Order of a permutation group versus degree of a permutation group,"Excuse my simple question. I am just starting to learn about group theory. I am trying to understand the description of cycle index for a permutation group.  The Wikipedia entry references both the group order and the degree of the group.  Also from Wikipedia, I read that The degree of a group of permutations of a finite set is the number of elements in the set. The order of a group (of any type) is the number of elements (cardinality) in the group. I have also read in this forum that a group can act on a set of any size.  So what does it mean if a group, say $C_{3}$, acts on a set of a size not equal to a multiple of the order of the group, say a set of size $5$ in this case such as $S=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$.  If we consider $C_{3}$ to be addition mod 3, then $4 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $5 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$.  So does $S$ have degree $5$ here even though $4$ and $5$ are equivalent to other values in the set?  Since the cycle index is based on permutations perhaps my example does not make any sense.  I am trying to think of an example that would use permutations but I am not quite sure how to express it mathematically. Aside: Can anyone suggest a better source than Wikipedia for learning about cycle index?","['group-theory', 'permutations']"

1405501,About the diameter of a Riemannian manifold,"My exact problem is a Riemannian manifold defined on $SU(2^n)$, where the metric is defined as follows: If $U(t)$ is a curve so that $U′(t)=−iH(t)U(t)$ (so just a unitary evolution of a quantum system of n qubits with a time dependent Hamiltonian $H(t)$), we can defined a metric at $U(t)$ as $$\langle H(t),H(t)\rangle =w_P(P(H(t)),P(H(t)))+w_Q(Q(H(t)),Q(H(t)))$$ where P,Q are orthogonal projections of H(t) into two orthogonal subspaces and  $(P(H),P(H)),(Q(H),Q(H))$ are inner products on these subspaces,$w_P,w_Q$  are weighting factors. It has been indicated that for some parameter selections of $(P(H),P(H)),(Q(H),Q(H))$ and $w_P,w_Q$, the manifold shows a negative curvature almost everywhere. To make things clear, obviously $H(t)$ is a vector of the Lie algebra of $SU(2^n)$. What the projectors $P$ and $Q$ did is to project $H(t)$ into two orthogonal subspaces of the Lie algebra, let's say $PH,QH$,  and then we define the metric so that we have different weights $w_P,w_Q$ on this two subspaces. Here more specifically, $PH$ is the subspace of all Hamiltonian that only involves no more than 2 qubits (local or simple). Or in another way, we know every $U$ can be reached by an EXP mapping $\operatorname{Exp}(-iH(U))$ since we always have $H(U)=i\operatorname{Log}(U)$, so that we have a diffeomorphism between the Lie algebra and the Lie group. Instead, the Riemannian manifold defined above will try to reach each $U$ from $I$ by a geodesic curve $U(t)$. But the metric is in fact setting constraints on the possible 'velocity' direction $U'(t)$ so that we prefer  that $H(t)\sim U'(t)$ can only falls in a subspace $PH$ of the Lie algebra. If in an extreme case, the wight $w_Q$ goes to infinity, then we only allow a velocity in the subspace $PH$ but not in $QH$. For me it seems quite possible that not every $U$ will be attainable from $I$. That's to say, there might exist a point $U$ so that there will be no geodesic/or a general curve with a finite length that can connect $I$ and $U$ because we are not allowed to travel along any direction in $QH$ (just imagine from point (0,0) you can not reach an arbitrary point $(x,y)$ in a unit square if you are only allowed to travel in x direction). I was told by M. Miller(thanks) that ""compact Riemannian manifold always has a finite diameter"". Since $SU(N)$ is compact, so definitely the diameter of the Riemannian manifold is finite. This seems to close the question. But my intuition does not see it. It seems there might exist some points $U$ that can not be reached from $I$ with a finite length. I think the contradiction might arise from the fact that I am thinking the case where $w_Q\rightarrow\infty$. So does this mean if both $w_P,w_Q$ are finite, we have a manifold with a finite diameter. But if $w_Q\rightarrow\infty$, then we have a different manifold so that ""compact Riemannian manifold always has a finite diameter"" does not apply? Is the manifold still a Riemannian manifold with $w_Q\rightarrow\infty$? P.S.: Since I am working on $SU(2^n)$, I was posted by Norbert Schuch that there is a way to decompose any $U \in SU(2^n)$ into simple operations involving no more than 2 qubits(let's say the unitary operators that can be achieved by a selected subspace $PH$) with a complexity of $n^3e^n$. This is exactly a special case of $w_Q\rightarrow\infty$ since we only allow simple/local operations in $PH$. Does this mean the answer highly depends on the selection of $PH, QH$?","['lie-groups', 'differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"

1406024,Equivalent condition for non-orientability of a manifold,"I've just came across this question , which gives us a great tool for showing that smooth manifold is non-orientable. Namely Thm. If $M$ is a smooth manifold and there are two charts $(U_a,\phi_a),(U_b,\phi_b),$ such that $U_a,U_b$ are connected, $U_a\cap U_b\neq\emptyset$ and transformation function $\phi_{ab}$ neither preserves nor reverses the orientation, then $M$ is non-orientable. Andrew D. Hwang gave an excellent answer. But still wonders me, if converse statement holds. I.e. Question. If $M$ is non-orientable, can we find two such charts $(U_a,\phi_a),(U_b,\phi_b)?$ Again Andrew D. Hwang suggested that it holds and gave me the following hint @Fallen: Yes, the converse is true. Intuitively, if M is non-orientable, there exists a loop (closed curve) around which ""the orientation reverses"". Thicken the loop into a tube and cover it with two ""solid cylinders"" Ua and Ub. There are details to check, and this sketch may not be the easiest strategy to make rigorous. (E.g., if no such charts exist, start with an arbitrary atlas and reverse chart orientations as needed to get an atlas of compatible charts. Again, though, there are details to check....). I only managed to do it assuming that $M$ is connected and second countable. Proof. Assume that for any two charts $(U_a,\phi_a),(U_b,\phi_b),$ such that $U_a,U_b$ are connected and $U_a\cap U_b\neq\emptyset$ transformation function $\phi_{ab}$ preserves or reverses orientation. We want to show that $M$ is orientable. Let $\{(V_i,\psi_i)\}_{i}$ be a countable atlas such that $V_i$ are connected. From that we want to construct a new atlas $\{(V_i,\overline{\psi}_i)\}_{i}$ which is oriented. Construction will be inductive.
$\overline{\psi}_1:=\psi_1. \overline{\psi}_i:=\psi_i$ or $\overline{\psi}_i:=\psi^*_i$ (here if $\psi_i=(x^1,\dots,x^n),$ then $\psi^*_i=(x^1,\dots,-x^n)$) to satisfy condition
$$\forall_{j<i}\overline{\psi}_{ji}\hspace{5pt}\text{preserves orientation,}$$ where $\overline{\psi}_{ji}$ is transformation function from $\overline{\psi}_j$ to $\overline{\psi}_i.$ But the obvious question is, if such procedure exists.

I am comfortable with teh statement: 'The restriction of a smooth map is also smooth' - but this is in terms of smooth maps from Euclidean space to Euclidean space. In order to show $\hat{\varphi}:=\varphi|_{S_1}$ is differentiable at some point $p\in S_1$ (when considered as a map between two regular surfaces), we must show that given parameterisations 
\begin{align*}
\textbf{x}_1:U_1\subset\mathbb{R}^2&\rightarrow S_1\\
\textbf{x}_2:U_2\subset\mathbb{R}^2&\rightarrow S_2
\end{align*}
such that $p\in\textbf{x}_1(U_1)$ and $\varphi(p)\in\textbf{x}_2(U_2)$, that the map
\begin{align*}
\textbf{x}_2^{-1}\circ {\varphi}\circ \textbf{x}_1:U_1\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2
\end{align*}
is a differentiable map between Euclidean space at $\textbf{x}_1^{-1}(p)$. So how would one show this? The immediate 'argument' I think of is chain rule -  'the composition of differentiable maps is differentiable' -- We have that $\textbf{x}_1$ is a differentiable map between Euclidean space by definition, as is $\varphi$. However, the map $\textbf{x}_2^{-1}$ is differentiable in the sense of a map between two regular surfaces ($S_2$ and the $xy$-plane).  So can we really employ the chain rule here given that $\textbf{x}_2^{-1}$ is defined as only a map from a regular surface to $\mathbb{R}^2$? What am I missing? Edit: From the advice below, I have tried to adapt the argument on Pg 70 of Do Carmo: is this a suitable justification that 
\begin{align*}
\textbf{x}_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ\textbf{x}_1
\end{align*}
is differentiable at $\textbf{x}_1^{-1}(p )$? Given that $\varphi(\textbf{x}_1(U_1))\subset\textbf{x}_2(U_2)$, it follows there exists $q\in U_2$ such that $\varphi(p )=\textbf{x}_2(q)$. Extend the map $\textbf{x}_2=(x_2(u,v),y_2(u,v),z_2(u,v))$ to a map $\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2:U_2\times \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ defined by
\begin{align*}
\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2:(u,v,t)\rightarrow (x_2,y_2,z_2+t).
\end{align*}
Then $\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2$ is differentiable and $\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2|_{U_2\times\{0\}}=\textbf{x}_2$. The determinant of $d\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2(q)\neq 0$. Thus, by the inverse function theorem, there exists a neighbourhood $M$ ($\subset\mathbb{R}^3$) of $\textbf{x}_2(q)=\varphi(p )$ such that $\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2^{-1}$ exists AND is differentiable on $M$ (as a map between Euclidean spaces). Define $N:=\textbf{x}_2(U_2)\cap M$. Then $\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2^{-1}|_N$ is smooth (as a map between a subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $U_2\times \mathbb{R}$ (restriction of smooth map is smooth)). If $\pi$ is the projection on to the first two factors, then $\pi$ is smooth and thus so is $\pi\circ \tilde{\textbf{x}}_2^{-1}|_N=\textbf{x}_2^{-1}$. Thus we have
\begin{align*}
\textbf{x}_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ\textbf{x}_1=\pi\circ\tilde{\textbf{x}}_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ\textbf{x}_1
\end{align*}
This map on the right hand side is a composition of smooth maps between Euclidean spaces. Thus, by the chain rule, it is smooth.","['differential-geometry', 'calculus', 'surfaces']"

1406905,Proof of Gruss inequality,"I've been reading articles that use the Gruss inequality for some time now, but I can't seem to find a proof of it anywhere. The only source I could find that actually has the proof is the original paper by Gruss, but the article costs $40 and I don't want to pay that much. The statement is as follows: Let $f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}$ be integrable functions on $[a,b]$ such that
$$
\phi \leq f(x) \leq \Phi, \enspace \gamma \leq g(x) \leq \Gamma, \enspace \forall x \in [a,b], \enspace \phi,\Phi,\gamma,\Gamma \in \mathbb{R}.
$$
Then the following inequality holds:
$$
\left| T(f,g) \right| \leq \frac{1}{4}(\Phi-\phi)(\Gamma-\gamma),
$$ where $$
T(f,g) := \frac{1}{b-a} \int\limits_a^b \! f(x)g(x)\,\mathrm{d} x - \frac{1}{b-a} \int\limits_a^b \! f(x)\,\mathrm{d} x \cdot
\frac{1}{b-a} \int\limits_a^b \! g(x)\,\mathrm{d} x.
$$ I've tried following these steps of the proof but I'm stuck on the very first one: First show that $T(f,f)\geq 0$, $T(g,g)\geq 0$ and $T^2(f,g)\leq T(f,f)T(g,g)$. Then show that $T(f,f)\leq \frac{1}{4}(\Phi-\phi)^2$ and $T(g,g)\leq \frac{1}{4}(\Gamma-\gamma)^2$. Combining these steps then yields the desired inequality. I know that the policy of this site is that you should show your work first, but right now the only thing I could show is a failed attempt at using Cauchy's or Holder's inequality to prove the statement. $\textbf{EDIT:}$ I found a proof so I'll post it if anyone gets curious. Firstly, we use this identity proven by K.A.Andreief, which states that the Chebyshev functional can be written as $$
T(f,g) = \frac{1}{2(b-a)^2} \int\limits_a^b \! \int\limits_a^b \! (f(x)-f(y))(g(x)-g(y)) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y.
$$ Now that it is written this way, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for double integrals we have $$
T^2(f,g)\leq T(f,f)T(g,g).
$$ By $A(f)$ we denote the arithmetical integral mean: $$
A(f) = \frac{1}{b-a} \int\limits_a^b \! f(x) \mathrm{d} x,
$$ so by the inequality between the arithmetic and quadratic mean we obtain $$
T(f,f)=A(f^2)-A^2(f) \geq 0.
$$ One can easily see that the following identity is also true $$
T(f,f) = (\Phi-A(f))(A(f)-\phi) - \frac{1}{b-a} \int\limits_a^b \! (\Phi-f(x))(f(x)-\phi) \mathrm{d} x,
$$ which then implies $$
T(f,f) \leq (\Phi-A(f))(A(f)-\phi).
$$ In the same way we can show that $$
T(g,g) \leq (\Gamma-A(g))(A(g)-\gamma)
$$ is valid. Combining previous steps, we obtain $$
T^2(f,g) \leq (\Phi-A(f))(A(f)-\phi)(\Gamma-A(g))(A(g)-\gamma).
$$ Finally, by the A-G inequality, it is obvious that $$
(\Phi-A(f))(A(f)-\phi)\leq \frac{1}{4}(\Phi-\phi)^2, \enspace (\Gamma-A(g))(A(g)-\gamma)\leq \frac{1}{4}(\Gamma-\gamma)^2
$$ so we have $$
T^2(f,g) \leq \frac{1}{16} (\Phi-\phi)^2(\Gamma-\gamma)^2,
$$ that is $$
|T(f,g)|\leq \frac{1}{4}(\Phi-\phi)(\Gamma-\gamma).

1406949,Showing that only $(n+1)^{n-1}$ of all the possible $n^n$ choices assure a full car park,"This exercise is taken from the site of Queen Mary University of London: A car park has $n$ spaces, numbered from $1$ to $n$ , arranged in a row. $n$ drivers each independently choose a favourite parking space in the park. As each driver enters the park, he drives to his favourite space. If it is empty, he parks there. Otherwise, he continues along the line and parks in the first free space. If all spaces between his favourite and $n$ are taken, he leaves in disgust. Show that, out of the $n^n$ choices of favourite spaces that the drivers can make, just $(n+1)^{n-1}$ lead to all drivers parking successfully. Now, my question is whether my (attempt of ) solution is wrong and what a different approach could be. Here's my idea: proving the claim by (a kind of) induction. It is easy to verify truthfulness for $n=1$ and $n=2$ , so having this base case, we shall prove that if the claim holds for all $1\le n\le k$ , then it does also for $n=k+1$ . Let us assume WLOG there is an already established order of appearance of the drivers, since a different order yields the same number of successful choices: it just suffices to swap the drivers. Let us call $d_m$ the space chosen by the $m$ -th driver. Now, consider the cases in which $d_1=1$ . By inductive hypothesis, the other drivers have $n^{n-2}$ successful choices. In fact, the same goes for all the other $n-1$ choices of the first driver, so that in total, as a ""first outcome"", we have $\color\red{n^{n-1}}$ successful choices. We somewhat can do the same reasoning with the second driver, but we must keep in mind that for each of his choices, we have already counted those in which the first driver occupies the other spaces. For example, we need to subtract the successful cases in which at the same time $d_2=1$ and $d_1=2$ : that is $(n-1)^{n-2}$ . This happens for all the spaces not chosen by the second driver, and so we actually need to subtract $(n-1)^{n-1}$ . Finally, letting vary $d_2$ yields the ""second outcome"" $\color\red{n^{n-1}-n(n-1)^{n-1}}$ . And so on, and so on. The final outcome would be the sum of all the red expressions. However I'm afraid no nice power would be a result of this. Is there a mistake in my reasoning?","['alternative-proof', 'proof-verification', 'combinatorics']"

$$ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f=0,$$
is it possible to find sufficient conditions on $a,b,c,d,e,f$ that guarantee a unique solution ? One sufficient condition is obviously $a,b,c,d,e>0$, so that the LHS of the above equation is strictly increasing in $x$. In my case, the coefficients are functions of several parameter values, so that $a,c,e>0$ and $b,d<0$, while $f\lessgtr0$ is ambiguous (depends on parameter values). My fifth degree polynomial is not always strictly increasing due to $b,d<0$, but still the solution is often unique, as the following numerical example shows: I could ""prove"" for this example that the solution is unique, by taking the derivative (a fourth degree polynomial), finding the local maxima and minima, and verifying that the function crosses 0 only once between the extrema or between the extrema and $-\infty,\infty$. But I was hoping there was a simpler and more general way. Moreover, my fifth degree polynomial is strictly increasing for some parameter values despite $b,d<0$. Is there a better way to figure out when this is the case than computing the derivative and determining whether

1407168,Optimal place to measure for simple linear regression/fitting,"Suppose I have a linear model $y_i=a\cdot x_i+b+\epsilon_i$, where $y_i,\epsilon_i,a,b\in\mathbb{R}$, $x_i\in[-1,1]$. I can take n measurements of $y_i$ at $x_i$, where $n\in\mathbb{N}$. $\epsilon_i$ denote the errors of measurement. I use $x_i$ and $y_i$ to fit $a$ and $b$, with simple linear regression. My goal is to get the most out of my limitted measurements. Which essentially means, I want the standard error of the estimator $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{b}$ as small as possible, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Normality_assumption . (Suppose the normality assumptions hold). But the only thing I can choose are the values of $x_i$.
How should I choose them? My thoughts up to now: Naive I would place them equispaced in my interval.

But then i would measure the same $x_i$ multiple times, which feels wrong. I remember from a lecture (10 years ago), that you preferably choose $x_i=cos(\frac{i⋅π}{n})$.

1407214,Understanding degrees of freedom in relation to rank for $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2$,"So I'm looking at this website which states: One of the questions an instrutor [sic] dreads most from a mathematically unsophisticated audience is, ""What exactly is degrees of freedom?"" It's not that there's no answer. The mathematical answer is a single phrase, ""The rank of a quadratic form."" And near the end: Okay, so where's the quadratic form? Let's look at the variance of a single sample. If $y$ is an $n$ by $1$ vector of observations, then
  $$\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2 = y^{\prime}My\text{, where }M = \begin{pmatrix}
1-\frac{1}{n} & -1/n & \cdot & -1/n \\
-1/n          & 1-\frac{1}{n} & \cdot & -1/n \\
\cdot         & \cdot         & \cdot & \cdot \\
-1/n          & -1/n          & -1/n & 1-\frac{1}{n}
\end{pmatrix}\text{.}$$
  The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the rank of the $n$ by $n$ matrix $M$, which is $n-1$. I will use $r$ to denote the rank and $C(A)$ to denote the column space of a matrix $A$. From my notes, I have the definition $r(A) = r\left(C(A)\right)$, which is the number of vectors that create a basis for $C(A)$. Sure. Let's consider column one:
$$\begin{pmatrix}
1-\frac{1}{n}\\
-1/n \\
\cdot \\
-1/n
\end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}
\begin{pmatrix}
1-n \\
1 \\
\cdot \\
1 
\end{pmatrix} = \dfrac{-1}{n}\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\

1

-n \\

1 \\
1 \\
\cdot \\
1 
\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
\cdot \\
0 
\end{pmatrix}\text{.}
$$
So based on what I'm seeing here, I'm guessing that a basis for $C(A)$ would be something like 
$$\mathscr{V} = \left\{\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
\cdot \\
1 
\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\

0 \\
1 \\
\cdot \\
0 
\end{pmatrix}, \cdots, \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
\cdot \\
1 
\end{pmatrix}\right\}$$
which consists of $n+1$ vectors. However, clearly $$\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
\cdot \\
1 
\end{pmatrix}$$ needs to be removed, since it is the sum of the other $n$ vectors, so I get that there are $n$ vectors in $\mathscr{V}$, and therefore $r(\mathscr{V}) = r(C(M)) = n$. Where is the $n-1$ coming from?","['statistics', 'linear-algebra']"
