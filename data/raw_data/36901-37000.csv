356045,"are ""all nets in $X$"" well defined?","Denote $f:X\to Y$ as a function between topological spaces $X$ and $Y$. One good way for determining whether $f$ is continuous is to check the following statement. $f$ is continuous iff for every converging net $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$ in $X$, one has $\lim_\alpha f(x_\alpha) = f(\lim_\alpha x_\alpha)$. However, ""every converging net"" seems not to be a well defined set, since the index set $\Lambda$ could in principle be any directed set with any cardinality. I wonder what one needs to give this a well defined meaning. From what I read, Wikipedia says nothing about it.","['general-topology', 'continuity', 'elementary-set-theory']"
356058,Additive set function properties,"I am reading an introduction to measure theory, which starts by defining $\sigma$-rings then additive set functions and their properties which are given without proof. I was able to prove two of them which are very easy $\phi(\emptyset)=0$ and $\phi(A_1\cup \ldots\cup A_n)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^nA_i$. There are three more which I couldn't do which are : 1- $\phi(A_1\cup A_2)+\phi(A_1 \cap A_2)=\phi(A_1)+\phi(A_2)$ for any two sets $A_1 $ and $A_2$. 2- If $\phi(A) \ge 0$ for all $A$ and $A_1 \subset A_2$ then $\phi(A_1) \le \phi(A_2)$. 3- If $A_1 \subset A_2$ and $|\phi(A_1)|< + \infty$ then $\phi(A_2-A_1)=\phi(A_2)-\phi(A_1)$.

356062,Matrix Derivative of $ABC$ with respect to $B$,"I have looked throughout the matrix cookbook and other sources, but am a bit confused by this problem. If I have a function $F = ABC$, what is the partial derivative of $F$ with respect to $B$? When it comes to matrix functions I could not find a nice answer to this problem. I did find something akin to $dF = CAdX$, but that doesn't seem to make sense as the dimensions of $C$ and $A$ would not match up for multiplication. A could be a $3\times3$, $B$ a $3\times 3$, and $ C$ a $3\times 4$. I'd appreciate help on this. Thanks. Edit- Well I had changed the problem to be more in line with what I was originally working with below in the comments. Here is the problem:
$f = tr((ABC)(ABC)^T)$ and I want the partial derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial B} tr((ABC)(ABC)^T)$. I ended up using a modified version of copper.hat's answer. I combined $A$ and $B$ to get something like this $2(ABC)C^T$ for the gradient. Thank you both for the help. Both answers below are technically correct, I just accepted the shorter and more convenient form.","['matrices', 'multivariable-calculus', 'functions', 'derivatives']"
356064,Solution of $ax=a^x$,"When I studied math at my school (I was 16) I was studying system of linear equations, and equations of first or second order and I liked it very much (and I was good to xD) but one day I asked to myself how to solve equation of this kind  $ax=a^x$ and ...I had no idea, I have felt completely disorientated. Now math is only an hobby for me (even if I don't study it at school I love it) so I tried again to solve this problem, using ""new concept"" I have ""learnt"" since I left school but still can't find a solution even using logarithm (aka even using a calculator). I noticed that $a^x-ax=0$ so I just need to find the zeros of the functions $f_a(x)=a^x-ax$ but I don't know how to solve this.
My second attempt was to using a graphical method plotting $ax=y$ and $a^x=y$ and finding the intersection, but this doesn't satisfy me. My last effort was to ""unify"" the two $x$'s and put them on the same side of the equation: $$a^x=ax$$ $$\log_a(a^x)=\log_a(ax)$$ $$x=1+\log_a(x)$$ $$a^{x-1}=x$$ $$a=x^{1/(x-1)}$$ here I'm lost and I am starting to doubt  that is possible to ""bring"" the $x$s using the ""standard"" algebra rules, to one side of the equation and get one $x$ ""alone"". Maybe I need more powerful theoretic tools to face this problem, but I don't understand why I can't find a way to ""reduce"" it to a simple form with easy operations $(+,\cdot)$ and powers. a) Maybe that means that the solution isn't even irrational? Why at this point all become harder? b) How can I face this problem? How to find the solution? Which are the extra concepts I need? I accept complete answers (even if I wanted only hints because I love to solve problems on my own, but I think this is above my level) I'm sorry for my terrible English but I'm using a translator.

356068,The proof of Raabe's Test for absolute convergence,"In Introduction to Real Analysis second edition by Bartle & Sherbert's, there is a proof of Raabe's Test for absolute convergence. The problem is that I don't understand why some part of the proof is necessary. I will show you first the proof as it is in the book, and then explain what I don't understand. Part (a) of the test is as follows: Raabe's Test: Let $X:=(x_n)$ be a sequence of nonzero real numbers. If there exists numbers $a>1$ and $K\in\mathbb{N}$ such that
$$\left|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\right|\leq 1-\frac{a}{n}\quad\text{for}\quad n\geq K,$$
then $\sum x_n$ is absolutely convergent. Proof: If the inequality holds, then we have
$$k|x_{k+1}|\leq(k-1)|x_k|-(a-1)|x_k|\quad\text{for}\quad k\geq K$$
On reorganizing the inequality, we have
$$(k-1)|x_k|-k|x_{k+1}|\geq(a-1)|x_k|>0\quad\text{for}\quad k\geq K$$
from which we deduce that the sequence $(k|x_{k+1}|)$ is decreasing for $k\geq K$. If we add the last inequality for $k=K,\ldots,n$ and note that the left side telescopes, we get
$$(K-1)|x_K|-n|x_{n+1}|\geq(a-1)(|x_K|+\cdots+|x_n|).$$
This shows (why?) that the partial sums of $\sum|x_n|$ are bounded and establishes the absolute convergence of the series. Q.E.D. Now, I don't see why it is important to show that the sequence $(k|x_{k+1}|)$ is decreasing. From the inequality
$$(K-1)|x_K|-n|x_{n+1}|\geq(a-1)(|x_K|+\cdots+|x_n|).$$
we have
$$(a-1)(|x_K|+\cdots+|x_n|)\leq (K-1)|x_K|\quad\text{for}\quad k\geq K$$
independently if $(k|x_{k+1}|)$ is decreasing or not since $n|x_{n+1}|>0$. So the partial sums of $\sum|x_n|$ are bounded anyway. Can someone explain me what I am missing?",['real-analysis']

356085,Inductive Limit Topology and First Countability,"Motivation: I am doing functional analysis on locally convex spaces for the first time and I would like to know when I am allowed to characterise limit points and continuity sequentially. (This may well be a silly question.) I phrase my question abstractly, but I mostly care about $\mathcal{C}_0^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Let $(X_n)$ be an increasing sequence of first-countable locally convex topological vector spaces and let $X=\cup_n X_n$. If we topologise $X$ with the finest locally convex topology such that the inclusions $X_n\rightarrow X$ are all continuous, is $X$ necessarily a first-countable space? (A local base for such a topology is given by the the collection of all balanced, convex, absorbent sets whose intersections with every $X_j$ is open in $X_j$.)

356129,Polynomial $x^3- xy^3$ and the like over finite fields.,"Let $f_{a,n}(x_1,x_2)$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_p[x_1,x_2]$, where $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a finite field or oder $p$ (perhaps, we may first assume that $p$ is prime) depending on $a\in\mathbb{F}_p$ and an integer $1\le n\le p-1$. Let $f_{a,n}$ be defined as follows as $f_{a,n}(x_1,x_2) := ax_1^n - x_1 x^n_2$. I am trying to investigate the following question: for what $a$ and $n$ is the polynomial $f_{a,n}$ surjective as a function from $\mathbb{F}_p\times\mathbb{F}_p$ to $\mathbb{F}_p$. As the question seems rather difficult, let us first concentrate on the case when $n = 3$, $a = 1$. It appears that the polynomial $f = f_{1,3} = x_1^3-x_1 x_2^3$ is surjective over any field of odd (not necessarily prime) characteristics $\mathbb{F}_p$, $3\le p\le 1000$, $p\neq 19$. I would like to understand the number theory behind this result. Why is the case $p = 19$ special or 'exceptional'? It is interesting to note that for all other values of $3 \le p \le 1000$, $p$ odd, the polynomial $f_{a,3}=a x_1^3-x_1 x_2^3$ is surjective for any $a\in\mathbb{F}_p$! (this is not $p!$, it is me being astinoshed by this result). For other combinations of $a$ and $n$ there are also such 'exceptional' values of $p$. Does anyone know if polynomials of the type $x^3-xy^3$ have been studied over finite fields?","['finite-fields', 'polynomials', 'number-theory']"
356139,Find area bounded by two unequal chords and an arc in a disc,"Math people: This question is a generalization of the one I posed at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/348296/find-area-bounded-by-two-chords-and-an-arc-in-a-disc .  Below is an image of a unit circle with center $O$.  $\theta_1, \theta_2 \in (0, \pi)$ and $\gamma \in (0, \min(\theta_1,\theta_2))$.  $\theta_1 = \angle ROS$, $\theta_2 = \angle POQ$, and $\gamma = \angle ROQ$.  I want to find the area of the shaded region with corners $P$, $R$, and $T$.  If $\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \theta$, then the area is
 $\frac{\theta-\gamma}{2}-\tan(\frac{\theta-\gamma}{2})\cos^2(\frac{\theta}{2})$.  I am in the middle of deriving a formula for the area for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ not necessarily equal.  I suspect that this has been done before, but I cannot find a reference.  I don't want to prove it, typeset a proof, and claim to have discovered the formula for the area if someone has done it before.  Has anyone seen this problem before, and can anyone provide a reference? UPDATE: I derived a formula for the area. It is $$\left(\frac{\theta_2}{2}-\frac{\sin(\theta_2)}{2}\right)-\left(\frac{\gamma - \sin(\gamma)}{2}+
       \frac{2\sin^2(\frac{\gamma}{2})

But if you set $\theta_1=\theta_2=\theta$ and take the limit as $\gamma \to \theta$, you get the right value. Of course, if anyone can locate a reference where someone has already found a formula for the area, that would also be welcome.

If ten unrelated persons are selected, what is the probability at least one is susceptible for the disease? Answer is 0.342 .

So, 0.3 * 0.05 + 0.6 * 0.04 + 0.1 * 0.02 = 0.041. Nvm, got it. So since the probability for a random person who has the disease is 0.041, the probability that a random person DOESN'T have the disease will be 1 - 0.041 = 0.959. Now since  we have ten people the probability that NONE of them have the disease is (0.959)*10 = 0.658. The original question asked for the probability that atleast one person had it.

g(x; \theta) = \frac{e^{-\theta}\theta^x}{x!(1-e^{-\theta)}}  x = 1,2,3,\dots \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3)

Also, once I calculate $\lambda$ and $\omega$, and use (1) to get a value for the frequency of $x=0$, I get a value very close to zero, whereas the frequency in the original table is 97 (all the other frequencies calculated by the model tally closely, as expected).

I know that there are other questions that are asking the same thing, but I'm trying to figure this out by myself as best as possible. Here is how I started out: Try out some cases: $x=0:$
$$f(0+y)=f(0)+f(y) \iff f(y)=f(0)+f(y) \iff 0=f(0) $$
The same result is for when $y=0$ $x=-y:$
$$f(-y+y)=f(-y)+f(y) \iff f(0)=f(-y)+f(y) \iff 0=f(-y)+f(y)\iff \quad f(-y)=-f(y)$$

$$f(qx)=f((1+1+...+1)x)=f(x+x+...+x)=f(x)+f(x)+...+f(x)=qf(x)$$
I understood this part, but I don't understand why this helps me find all the functions that satisfy the requirement that $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$, but here is how I went on: Thus 
$$f(qx)=qf(x)$$ and it should follow that
$$f \bigg (\frac {1}{q} x\bigg)= \frac{1}{q}f(x)$$ where $q\not =0$, then it further follows that 
$$f \bigg (\frac {p}{q} x\bigg)= \frac{p}{q}f(x)$$ where $\frac{p}{q}$ is rational, and lastly it further follows that 
$$f (ax)= af(x)$$ where $a$ is real. Thus functions of the form $f(ax)$ where $a$ is real satisfies the requirement of  $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$. I don't know how much of what I did is correct\incorrect, and any help would be greatly appreciated. Also is there any way that I can say that functions of the form $f(ax)$ where $a$ is real are the only functions that satisfy the requirement of  $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$? Or do other solutions exist?

My argument below attempts to show that for $x \ge 1331$ , there is always a prime between $4x$ and $5x$ . I can use a similar argument to establish there is a prime between $2x$ and $3x$ and between $3x$ and $4x$ .  Based on some rough estimates, it looks it should also work to prove a prime between $5x$ and $6x$ as well as a prime between $6x$ and $7x$ . Since I am still getting up to speed on analytic number theory, I will be very glad if someone can point out the mistake that I am making in my reasoning.  I am not yet able to find it. Let $$\vartheta(x) = \sum_{p \le x}\ln(p)$$ Let $$\psi(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\vartheta(x^{\frac{1}{n}})$$ Following Ramanujan [see (6)]: $$\psi(x) - 2\psi(\sqrt{x}) \le \vartheta(x) \le \psi(x)$$ Analogous to Ramanujan's statement about: $$\ln(\lfloor{x}\rfloor]!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!) = \psi(x) - \psi(\frac{x}{2}) + \psi(\frac{x}{3}) - \psi(\frac{x}{4}) + \ldots$$ Here's my restatement in terms of $4x$ and $5x$ : $$\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) = \psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \ldots$$ where for each successive term we can see: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{8}) \ge \psi(\frac{x}{10}) \ge  \ldots$$ Since, for any integer $v \ge 1$ , we have: $$\psi(\frac{x}{20v+4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{20v+5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{20v+8})-\psi(\frac{x}{20v+10})+\psi(\frac{x}{20v+12}) -\psi(\frac{x}{20v+15}) + \psi(\frac{x}{20v+16}) - \psi(\frac{x}{20v+20}) + \ldots$$ That is, a decreasing sequence of real numbers tending to 0, where each successive term has an alternating sign. So, based on reasoning found here , it follows: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!)$$ From $\psi(x) - 2\psi(\sqrt{x}) \le \vartheta(x) \le \psi(x)$ , it follows that: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) + 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12})$$ Using the same reasoning as above, it can be noted that: $$\psi(\frac{x}{10}) - \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ So that we have: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) + 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - [ \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!) ]$$ which implies: $$\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) - 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) - \psi(\frac{x}{8}) + \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ From Rosser and Schoenfeld (1961) , we know that (see Theorem 12): $$\psi(x) < 1.03883x$$ So that: $$\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) \ge \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{4}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{5}\rfloor!) -\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{20}\rfloor!) - 2(1.03883)(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) - (1.03883)(\frac{x}{8}) + \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!)$$ Based on Stirling's Approximation and my reasoning found here , it follows that $\vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) > 0$ for $x \ge 1331$ I have also verified that for $1331 > x > 2$ , there is always a prime between $5x$ and $4x$ so if my argument is valid, this would be enough to establish that there is always a prime between $5x$ and $4x$ for $x \ge 3$ . Is this approach valid? Update: I have found my mistake.  The following step is invalid: $$\psi(\frac{x}{4}) - \psi(\frac{x}{5}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - \psi(\frac{x}{10}) + \psi(\frac{x}{12}) \le \vartheta(\frac{x}{4}) - \vartheta(\frac{x}{5}) + 2\psi(\sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}) + \psi(\frac{x}{8}) - [ \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{12}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{60}\rfloor!) ]$$ Edit: I have added a clarification below on what type of answer I am looking for to this question. Clarification: I am especially interested in one of these answers to this question: Is this approach already ""well-understood"" (in which case, I would be interested in a reference) Does this approach have ""a major gap"" (if so, which part of the argument is wrong or needs additional detail) Could it be interesting ""if it shows...""

Therefore, $\aa = (a)$, and thus $A$ is also a PID. That's the best way to use the fact that $A[x]$ is a PID that I've found so far.

Consider $\pi_M,\pi_N$ the respective projections from it to $M,N$. The question is how to prove that $$(\pi_M)_*[M\times_XN]=f_!g_*[N]$$ as elements of $H_{m+n-d}(M;\mathbb{Z})$ (here $f_!$ is the shriek map $f_!=PD_M\circ f^*\circ PD_X^{-1}$). N.B.: I can prove the result for real coefficients, but I would like to find a proof for integer coefficients. Edit: In view of Stella's comment I'll write down the proof I have for real coefficients. Let me work in cohomology instead of homology: the equality I want to prove is equivalent to $$\pi_M^!(1)=f^*g^!(1).$$ Consider the projections $$\pi_1:X\times X\rightarrow X,\ \tilde{\pi}_M:M\times N\rightarrow M,$$ the inclusion map $$i:M\times_XN\rightarrow M\times N$$ and the map $$(f,g):M\times N\rightarrow X\times X.$$ Then we have (1) $\pi_1\circ(f,g)=f\circ\tilde{\pi}_M$, (2) $\pi_M=\tilde{\pi}_M\circ i$ and (3) $M\times_XN=(f,g)^{-1}(\Delta)$. Moreover let $a_i$ be a basis for $H_{dR}(X)$ and let $b_i$ be its dual basis with respect to Poincaré duality. Then (4) $PD_{X\times X}^{-1}([\Delta])=\sum a_i\otimes b_i$. Now, from (3) we have that $$i^!(1)=((f,g)^*\circ PD_{X\times X}^{-1})([\Delta]),$$ which from (4) leads to $$i^!(1)=\sum f^*(a_i)\otimes g^*(b_i).$$ We use (2) to get $$\pi_M^!(1)=(\tilde{\pi}_M^!\circ i^!)(1)=\tilde{\pi}_M^!\left(\sum f^*(a_i)\otimes g^*(b_i)\right).$$ Finally, since $\tilde{\pi}_M^!$ is integration along the fibre we get $$\pi_M^!(1)=\sum f^*(a_i)\int_Ng^*(b_i).$$ On the other hand, $g^!(1)=(PD_X^{-1}\circ g_*)[N]=\sum a_i\int_Ng^*(b_i)$, and applying $f^*$ we get the same expression as above.","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

First I looked at the definition for orientability for manifolds of higher degree than 2, because for surfaces I know the definition with the Möbius strip. A n-dimensional manifold is non-orientable if it contains a homeomorphic image of the space formed by taking the direct product of a (n-1)-dimensional ball B and the unit interval [0,1] and gluing the ball B×{0} at one end to the ball B×{1} at other end with a single reflection. The projective space can be seen as $\mathbb S^n/\mathbb Z_2$ or $\mathbb D^n$ with antipodal points identified on the boundary. I have looked at other similar questions like Why isn't $\mathbb{RP}^2$ orientable? In that thread someone states that the antipodal map is orientation preserving if $n$ is odd and reversing when $n$ is even. Why is this? Intuitively the antipodal map can be constructed by combining $n+1$ reflections in the hyperspaces $x_i=0$ and if $n$ is odd $n+1$ is even and combining an even amount of reflections is orientation preserving and the other way around for $n$ even and $n+1$ odd. I need a hint for a rigorous proof. Also after I establish this for myself, I need to show that in  $\mathbb D^n$  with n even and with antipodal points identified on the boundary the higher dimensional analogue of Möbius strip, which has just one reflection, can be embedded.

The example I am looking at is to do with irreducible and reducible polynomials. It says e.g in $\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$ , $x^2 + x + 1 = (x + 2)(x+2) = (x-1)(x-1)$ because $x^2 + x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$ .

How can she write $x^2 + x + 1 = (x + 2)(x + 2)$ when $(x + 2) (x+2) = x^2 + 4x + 4$ and how can she say that $x^2 + x + 1 = x^2 - 2x + 1$ ?

356983,"Random walk, Cat and mouse","Here is the problem.
In graph G, on different vertices there is cat and mouse. Cat and mouse do independent
random walk, but time is synchronous, in one unit of time both cat and mouse do one step. a)Estimate expected life duration of mouse, if cat eat mouse whenever they are on
the same vertices. They can meet on the edge without consequences. Estimate should
depend on number of edges and vertices. b) Same as above, but G is cycle $C_{2n}$ and cat and mouse starts in maximal distance from each other. Count exactlz expected mouse life duration. c)Same as B, but graph G is hypercube of dimension k. My progress so far:
a) Let $G=(V,E)$, $V=\{1, \dots, n\}$
Let P be the matrix with probability distribution for random walk $P_{ij}=P(M_{t+1}=i|M_t=j)=\frac{1}{d_j}$, where $M_t$ is position of random walk after
t steps. Let $v=(\frac{1}{n}, \dots, \frac{1}{n})$ be the initial distribution vektor.
Now if we know, that Cat and Mouse distribution is virtually the same, we just need to 
do estimate on the probability, that they meet together after at least t steps.
Let $C_t$ and $M_t$ be the position of cat and mouse respectively after t steps. And
let L to be life duration of Mouse.
I propose $P(C_t=M_t)=<P^tv,P^tv>$, where <> is scalar product of distribution Cat and
Mouse random walk after t steps. Because probability that they meet at vertex $i$ is
the probability $$P(C_t=M_t=i)=P(C_t=i)P(M_t=i)=(P^tv)_i^2$$
Is it correct? Assuming this, I have $P(L\leq t)\geq <P^tv,P^tv>$, I must count
the case, that cat and mouse meet earlier than at t, so there are inequalities. In
the end I need to estimate
$$E(L)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}kP(L=t)$$
which is by using $P(L=t)=P(L\leq t)-P(L\leq t-1)$ and telescoping the sum is
$$E(L)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}P(L\leq t)\geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}<P^tv,P^tv>$$
Problem is how to estimate this and if this is good direction if its correct. b) Here again if cats random walk is C_t and Mouse random walk is M_t. First observation is
that on on graph $C_{2(2n+1)}$, when cat and mouse start at maximal distance from each other there is no way, they can meet, because there is odd number of edges between them.
So I assume the graph is $C_{4n}$
 I can maybe do the random walk H_t=(C_t-M_t) in such way, that if graph is $C_{4n}$ then
we make from that a path on 2n+1 vertices $(1,\dots, 2n+1)$. With starting point in the middle. Distance of $H_t$ from closer of the ends of the path will correspond to distance of C_t and M_t, so if cat and mouse meet at the vertex $H_t=1$ or $H_t=2n+1$. and distribution for random walk of $H_t$ will be 
$$P(H_{t+1}=H_t+1)=1/4$$ Cat moves clockwise and Mouse moves counterclockwise
$$P(H_{t+1}=H_t-1)=1/4$$ Cat moves counterclockwise and Mouse moves clockwise
$$P(H_{t+1}=H_t)=1/2$$ Both Cat and Mouse moves counterclockwise or both move clockwise I need to count expected time, that $H_t$ meet either of the edges of the path.
To simplify I can simplify I can identify first and last vertex of the path

356995,Counting non-isomorphic relations,"On a set $X$ of $n$ elements, how many non-isomorphic relations are there? The number of relations on a set of $n$ elements is $|\mathcal{P}(X \times X)|=2^{n^2}$, but is there any way to give a general formula for how many of these are non-isomorphic?

357121,"The Cantor Space as $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and as $[0,1]$.","The Cantor-Space is defined as the space of all infinite binary sequences, i.e. the space $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$. It has a natural metric,
$$
  d(x,y) = \inf\{ 2^{-|w|} : w \in pref(x) \cap pref(y) \}
$$
where $pref(x)$ denotes the set of all prefixes of $x$ (i.e. finite initial segments of an infinite binary sequence/string). Let $X = \{0,1\}$ and $X^*$ denote all finite sequences over $X$. Then the open, closed and clopen sets are characterised as follows: 1) Open sets are of the form $W \cdot X^{\mathbb{N}}$, where $W \subseteq X^*$. 2) A subset $E \subseteq X^{\mathbb{N}}$ is open and closed (clopen) iff $E = W \cdot X^{\mathbb{N}}$ where $W \subset X^*$ is finite. 3) A subset $F \subseteq X^{\mathbb{N}}$ is closed iff $F = \{ \xi : pref(\xi) \subseteq pref(F) \}$. Now every $x = x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots \in X^{\mathbb{N}}$ could be identified with an element from $[0,1]$ by the dyadic interpretation
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^i} x_i
$$
and by identifiying sequences of the form $010000...$ and $001111...$ one gets an isomorphism. Now I ask myself how look the images of closed, open and clopen sets under this isomorphism, if $x$ is closed, then the image is also a closed subset of $[0,1]$, but what about the open sets? EDIT: Corrected definition of $d(x,y)$. EDIT: Corrected last equation. EDIT: To clarify point 3). Lemma: Let $L$ be a subset of $X^{\mathbb{N}}$ and let $u \in X^{\mathbb{N}}$. Then $u \in \overline{L}$ iff every prefix of $u$ is a prefix of a word of $L$. Proof : We have $u \in \overline{X}$ iff for each $n \ge 0$ there exists $v \in L$ such that $d(u,v) < 2^{-n}$. This amounts to saying that, for each $n \ge 0, u_1\ldots u_n$ is a prefix of a word of $L$. q.e.d. Note that $d(x,y)$ could also be written:
$$
 d(x,y) = 2^{-r} \quad where \quad r = \operatorname{min}\{ n | x_n \ne y_n \}.

$$V = \{u \in H^1 : \nabla u \cdot \nu = 0 \;\;\text{on}\;\; \partial\Omega\}$$
and $H = L^2$. But showing $V$ is dense in $H$ is a problem. So I guess this is not how we do it. How else can I tackle this problem without putting the BC in the Hilbert space? Thanks","['sobolev-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"
