3167756,Inconsistency of limits,"Let $I_n(x)$ and $L_n(x)$ be the modified Bessel and modified Struve functions of order $n$ , respectively. Assuming $x$ is real, I am interested in the following limit: $$ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{I_0(x)L_1(x) - I_1(x)L_0(x)}{x^2I_2(x)}. $$ Let's call the function $G(x)/x^2$ . Now, using Wolfram Alpha I find that $$ \lim_{x\to\infty} G(x) = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{I_0(x)L_1(x) - I_1(x)L_0(x)}{I_2(x)} = -\frac{2}{\pi}. $$ So it seems like $$ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{I_0(x)L_1(x) - I_1(x)L_0(x)}{x^2I_2(x)} = \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{G(x)}{x^2} = \left(\lim_{x\to\infty} G(x)\right)\left(\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x^2}\right) = 0 $$ On the other hand, Wolfram Alpha gives me $$ \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{G(x)}{x^2} = -\infty. $$ What went wrong?","['limits', 'wolfram-alpha', 'special-functions', 'bessel-functions']"
3167824,$M$ is projective iff $M$ is locally free,"How to prove this theorem? A finitely presented module is projective iff it is locally free (the localization at every prime ideal is free over the localized ring). This is given right after the statement that a finitely generated module over a local ring is free. How to use it? If $M$ is a finitely presented projective module, then its localization $M_P$ is a module over a local ring. Is the localization again projective? If so, the statement I mentioned can be applied. For the other direction, the hint says to use that if $S$ is flat over $R$ and $M$ is finitely presented, then there is an isomorphism $$S\otimes_R Hom_R(M,N)\to Hom_S(S\otimes_R M, S\otimes_R N)$$ More specifically, the hint is to show that for any surjection $\phi: F\to M$ , the map $Hom_R(M,F)\to Hom_R(M,M)$ is also a surjection. But not only don't I see how to deduce that from the above, but also I'm not sure why this is enough to show.","['projective-module', 'abstract-algebra', 'commutative-algebra', 'modules']"
3167841,Nontrivial Twists of a Vector Bundle,"Let $k$ be a number field, and let $X$ be a projective $k$ -variety. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a vector bundle on $X$ that is defined over $k$ . A vector bundle $\mathcal{V}'$ on $X$ that is defined over $k$ is said to be a twist of $\mathcal{V}$ if there is some finite extension $\ell/k$ such that we have an isomorphism $\mathcal{V}_\ell \simeq \mathcal{V}'_\ell$ of bundles upon basechanging to $\ell$ . Question: Is it true that all twists of $\mathcal{V}$ are in fact isomorphic to $\mathcal{V}$ over $k$ ? What I know: Twists are parameterized by the Galois cohomology group $H^1(\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{k}/k),\operatorname{Aut}(\cal{V}_{\overline{k}}))$ , so all we need to do is determine whether this cohomology group is equal to $0$ . It's a consequence of Hilbert Theorem 90 that $H^1(\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{k}/k),\operatorname{GL}_n(\overline{k})) = 0$ , which might be useful.","['number-theory', 'galois-cohomology', 'galois-theory', 'vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry']"
3167884,Did Lie Theory manage to unify ordinary differential equations,"In Lie Gourp wikipedia entry ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group ) it is said: The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of differential equations. On the model of Galois theory and polynomial equations, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of symmetry, the whole area of ordinary differential equations. However, the hope that Lie Theory would unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations was not fulfilled. Symmetry methods for ODEs continue to be studied, but do not dominate the subject. But did Lie's theory finally manage to unify the entire field of ordinary differential equations? Or maybe some version of it?...","['lie-algebras', 'unification', 'lie-groups', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3168169,Why are the sums of absolutely convergent series not affected by changing the order of summation?,"Here is my attempt to understand this:
Let $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(-1\right)^{\left(n+1\right)}a_n $$ be an alternating series now the infinite sum is defined as the limit of the sequence of partial sums and so a partial sum of $m$ terms of the series where $m$ is an even number (I think it wouldn't make a difference if $m$ was odd since we will take the limit as $m$ approaches infinity anyway) is: $$ \sum_{n=1}^{m}\left(-1\right)^{\left(n+1\right)}a_n = \sum_{n=1}^{m/2}(a_{2n-1}) - \sum_{n=1}^{m/2}(a_{2n})$$ Now taking the limit as $m$ approaches infinity on both sides and denoting the limit on the left by $S$ , the first sum on the right side by $S_o$ and the last sum by $S_e$ $$S = \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}(S_o-S_e)$$ the right term is the limit of a difference , If limits as $m$ approaches infinity of both $S_o$ and $S_e$ exist the limit can be separated which means that no matter how you change the order of summation of the original sum it can be rearranged such that the positive terms are together and the negative terms are together and since both limits exist their values are unique and their difference is the unique sum of the whole series. this seems to make sense until I try to convince myself that if one (or both) of the limits of $S_o$ and $S_e$ as $m$ approaches infinity doesn't exist (since proving that one doesn't exist implies the same of the other) corresponds to proving the fact that changing the order of summation of the original series changes the value of $S$ and that it isn't unique anymore.

3168195,Arranging cats and dogs - what is wrong with my approach,"We have 4 dogs and 3 cats in a line but no two cats can be together, in how many ways can they be arranged? Since there are 5 spaces the cats can be in with the dogs fixed, there are ${5 \choose 3} * 4! * 3! = 1440$ ways and this is the correct answer. I thought of a different approach. Instead of fixing the dogs' places, I fixed the places of the cats. Now, we have 4 spaces of which the two spaces in the middle must be filled. Therefore, out of the 4 dogs, 2 must fill those, and there are $4 * 3$ ways of doing this (since one dog must be chosen to fill one middle space and the other, to fill the second but now there are only 3 dogs left.) The other two dogs are free to go to any of the 4 spaces, with $4^2$ possibilities. The cats can now be arranged in $3!$ ways.

But how can we prove any divisor of $f(a)$ is a fourth power? If we prove that any prime divisor $p$ of $f(a)$ is a fourth power modulo $13$ , we would be done as the fourth powers form a group under multiplication modulo $13$ . If we can write $f(a)=P(a)^2-13Q(a)^2$ for some polynomials $P(a)$ and $Q(a)$ , $p$ divides $f(a)$ implies $13$ is a square modulo $p$ and quadratic reciprocity will imply $p$ is a square modulo $13$ .

3168267,Why is the Lagrange multiplier considered to be a variable?,"I'm learning the math behind SVMs (Support Vector Machines) from here . I understood the intuition behind Lagrange multipliers.

Isn't it just a constant by which the gradient vectors of the objective function (for which the optimization is to be done) and the subject function (constraint function) vary in length? Here is the equation of the Lagrangian: $$L(x, y, \lambda) = f(x,y) - \lambda g(x, y)$$ where $f(x, y)$ is objective function and $g(x, y)$ is constraint function. Now applying gradient both sides: $$\nabla L(x, y, \lambda) = \nabla f(x,y) - \lambda \nabla g(x, y)$$ Here while applying $\nabla$ , we've considered $\lambda$ as constant, even if we are considering Lagrangian ( $L$ ) as a function of $x$ , $y$ and $\lambda$ . What I'm missing here? Any intuitive explanation will help. Thanks! EDIT In Wikipedia page of this topic, $\lambda$ is considered as constant. Here is the direct quote from Wikipedia page. The constant λ is required because although the two gradient vectors are parallel, the magnitudes of the gradient vectors are generally not equal. This constant is called the Lagrange multiplier.

3168395,Definition of differentiability,"I can't figure out the intuition and motivation behind the following definition: Function $f$ , defined in some neighborhood of $x_0$ , is said to be differentiable, if: $$f(x_0 + \Delta x)-f(x_0)=A\Delta x+o(\Delta x), \Delta x \rightarrow 0$$ where $A$ is some real number, or equivalently: $$\Delta y=A\Delta x +\epsilon(\Delta x)\Delta x$$ where $\epsilon(\Delta x)$ is infinitely small as $\Delta x \rightarrow 0$ . I understand the limit definition of differentiability, and I understand the proof that two definitions are equivalent, but I just don't get the above one.
At first look it says that we can approximate the change of function by some linear(?) function ?
And if it's saying that we can approximate the value of $f$ at point $a$ by some linear function, doesn't this definition make every function differentiable, as we can chose constant function $f(x)=a$ for approximation .. ?

3168409,Bias and variance of IV estimation,"NOTE: I have asked this question on stat.stackoverflow but got no answers/comments. Hence I decide to ask it on the math.stackoverflow platform as well. I'm studying IV estimation by myself and have some confusion about the basics. Let $y=X\beta_0 + u$ be a linear model with endogenous variable $X$ , and $Z$ be an instrument, meaning that $Z$ and $u$ are uncorrelated, and $Z$ and $X$ are correlated. For simplicity let's say both $X$ and $Z$ are univariate. The IV estimation takes the form of $$
\widehat\beta = \beta_0 + (Z'X)^{-1}Z'u.
$$ I understand that $\widehat\beta$ is consistent because $Z'u\overset{p}{\to} 0$ , $Z'X\overset{p}{\to} a\neq 0$ and therefore by Slutsky's theorem $\widehat\beta\overset{p}{\to}\beta_0$ . However, I'm having some trouble on other properties of $\widehat\beta$ . Is $\widehat\beta$ unbiased? For me it seems $\widehat\beta$ is not unbiased, because $Z'u$ and $Z'X$ are correlated (are they?) and therefore $\mathbb E[Z'u]=0$ does not mean $\mathbb E[(Z'X)^{-1}Z'u]=0$ ? If $\widehat\beta$ is indeed biased, how do we obtain the (asymptotic) variance of $\widehat\beta$ ? If we calculate by definition then $\mathbb E|\widehat\beta-\beta_0|^2 = \mathbb E[(Z'X)^{-1}Z'uu'Z(Z'X)^{-1}]$ but $u$ is not uncorrelated with $(Z'X)^{-1}Z'$ , and how do we simplify this expression?","['linear-regression', 'statistics']"

By closed form, I mean something like the combination of sums ( $\sum$ ) or products ( $\prod$ ) or anything else that would make solving for $k$ the equation $$e_1^T A^k e_1= 1/2$$ easier. Such a $k$ is called the half life of an AR(p) process whose coefficients are the first row of $A$ . Explanation for the time-series tag: This problem arises from computing the impulse response function, and therefore the half life, of a general AR process. Edit: $A$ is diagonalisable, non singular, and has spectral radius < 1 for what it's worth. So one numerical way to solve the equation $e_1^T A^k e_1= 1/2$ I can think about is to first diagonalise it as $A=QDQ^{-1}$ , then we can define for any real number $k$ the matrix power $A^k$ as $$A^k=QD^kQ^{-1}$$ And once we obtain $Q$ , $D$ numerically, we can expect to get a polynomial in $\lambda_{1,\cdots, n}^k$ where $\lambda$ are eigenvalues of $A$ , and thus is solvable by software.","['matrices', 'time-series', 'linear-algebra', 'block-matrices']"

3168569,Some questions about different axiomatic systems for neighbourhoods,"I was thinking a few days ago about the development of topology, especially how you arrive at the concept of a topology $\tau$ . I knew that a lot of initial ideas came from Hausdorff who defined a topological space by giving neighbourhood axioms; so I had a look at the original text ,,Grundzüge der Mengenlehre'' to see how his definition compares to the contemporary one. Here is a translation of the ,,Umgebungsaxiome'' that Hausdorff gives: $(A)~$ To every point $x$ , there is some neighbourhood $U_x$ ; every neighbourhood $U_x$ contains the point $x$ . $(B)~$ If $U_x,V_x$ are two neighbourhoods of the same point $x$ , there is a neighbourhood $W_x$ , which is in both of them ( $W_x \subseteq U_x \cap V_x$ ). $(C)~$ If the point $y$ lies in $U_x$ , there is a neighbourhood $U_y$ , which is a subset of $U_x$ ( $U_y \subseteq U_x$ ). $(D)~$ For two different points $x,y$ there exist two neighbourhoods $U_x, U_y$ with no common points ( $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$ ). and here is a version of the neighbourhood axioms you might find in a modern textbook $\mathcal{N}(x)$ is a set of neighbourhoods for $x$ iff \begin{align*}
        (0)&~~~ x \in \bigcap \mathcal{N}(x) \\
        (1)&~~~ X \in  \mathcal{N}(x) \\
        (2)&~~~ \forall ~U_1,U_2 \in \mathcal{N}(x) : ~ U_1 \cap U_2 \in \mathcal{N}(x) \\
        (3)&~~~ \forall~ U \subseteq X ~~\forall~ N \in \mathcal{N}(x):~ N \subseteq U \Longrightarrow U \in \mathcal{N}(x) \\
        (4)&~~~ \forall~ U \in \mathcal{N}(x) ~~\exists~ V \in \mathcal{N}(x)~ \forall p \in V :~ U \in \mathcal{N}(p) 
    \end{align*} Here are a few questions I still have after reading and thinking about it: $(i)$ Are these axiomatic systems equivalent? Even leaving out axiom $(D)$ (since it says that the space is $T_2$ ) it does not seem to me that they are. A few of them clearly are equivalent, but I don't see how you could derive $(3)$ from $(A) - (C)$ . I could at least imagine that one was added over time, which would explain the problem. $(ii)$ What is the use of axiom $(4)$ ? I think most helpful to me would be an example of a proof in which the axiom is indispensable. $(iii)$ (more historically minded question) How did the word ,,Umgebung'' ended up being translated to neighbourhood? Hausdorff calls a set $U_x$ a ,,Umgebung'' of $x$ which in English (at least in the mathematical literature) is called a neighbourhood . This is quite strange, since neighbourhood has a direct translation to the German: ,,Nachbarschaft'' whose meaning is quite different from the one of ,,Umgebung'' . I my opinion the later would be better translated by the word surrounding . Which makes me curious how the translation came about.","['general-topology', 'math-history', 'axioms']"

The joint pdf of the sample is: $$f_X(\boldsymbol{x}|\theta)=e^{n(\theta-\bar{x})}\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{(1+e^{-(x_{(i)}-\theta)})^2}.$$ I want to apply Theorem 6.2.13, so I want to verify that for every two sample points $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ , the ratio $\frac{f(\boldsymbol{x}|\theta)}{f(\boldsymbol{y}|\theta)}$ is independent of $\theta$ if and only if $T(\boldsymbol{x}) = T(\boldsymbol{y})$ . This ratio is: $$e^{n(\bar{y}-\bar{x})} \prod_{i=1}^n \bigg(\frac{1+e^{-(y_{(i)}-\theta)}}{1+e^{-(x_{(i)}-\theta)}}\bigg)^2.$$ Now the first part is independent of $\theta$ , so we just need to verify (dropping the square) that $$\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1+e^{-(y_{(i)}-\theta)}}{1+e^{-(x_{(i)}-\theta)}}$$ is independent of $\theta$ if and only iff the $T(\boldsymbol{x})=T(\boldsymbol{y})$ are equal. In the solutions and everywhere else I've looked online this is just stated as true, and while the ""if"" direction is obvious, the ""only if"" one isn't.

3168820,Combinatorial proof of $\binom{nk}{2}=k\binom{n}{2}+n^2\binom{k}{2}$,"This identity was posted a while back but the question had been closed; the question wasn't asked elaborately, though the proof of the identity is a nice application of combinatorics and a good example for future reference. Also, there was just a flat-out wrong answer which had a couple of upvotes, so I thought to give my own possible proof and sort of 'reopen' the question that was left. Hopefully this time the question will have enough context to stay alive. As a side note:  the given right side does not appear symmetric between $k$ and $n$ .  However, when $\binom{m}{2}=m(m-1)/2$ is inserted and the products expanded, only symmetric terms remain uncancelled.  Rendering the right side as $k^2\binom{n}{2}+n\binom{k}{2}$ would give the same cancellations and the same net value. Proof Suppose you have a grid of $n\times k$ dots. Firstly, the amount of ways to connect any two dots is $\binom{nk}{2}$ . Now consider the right-hand side. We can split the cases for which the connected dots are on the same column, row, or are in both different columns and rows. If the two connected dots are in the same column, we can choose two points from any two different rows in $\binom{n}{2}$ ways, and we have $k$ columns for which the two points can be on the same column, which gives a total of $k\binom{n}{2}$ options. The same argument holds for constant rows: $n\binom{k}{2}$ . Now if neither the row nor the column can stay constant, we can pick any point in $nk$ ways, and choose the second point from the remaining $(n-1)(k-1)$ points; one column and one row will be unavailable. This gives us $\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}$ options, as we have to rule out the double counting. We will now show (algebraically) that $n\binom{k}{2}+\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}=n^2\binom{k}{2}$ .
We have that $\binom{k}{2}=\frac{k(k-1)}{2} =\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2n(n-1)} \iff n(n-1)\binom{k}{2}=\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2}=n^2\binom{k}{2}-n\binom{k}{2}$ which leads to the equation above. Combining these cases gives $\binom{nk}{2}=k\binom{n}{2}+n\binom{k}{2}+\frac{nk(n-1)(k-1)}{2} = k\binom{n}{2}+n^2\binom{k}{2}$ If there are any mistakes or improvements on the arguments, please feel free to point them out.","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'discrete-mathematics']"

But when I tried to prove it, I used a different approach. Can someone please verify my work? Thank you and any critic is highly appreciated! It's a proven fact that $X$ is a countable set if and only if $\exists f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ surjective. Therefore if $X$ is not a countable set then $\nexists f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ . Since $X$ is infinite, it can be a (1) countable infinite set of an (2) uncountable infinite set. (1) is trivial, since $X \subset X$ , the theorem is proved for this case. (2) $X$ is an uncountable infinite set. We can conclude by our previous statement that $\nexists f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X$ surjective. Therefore, for every function that maps $\mathbb{N}$ to $X$ there'll be elements of $X$ that is not image of any $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let's define a set of those elements: $$
S:= \{x \in X | f(n) \neq x \text{ } \forall n \in \mathbb{N} \}
$$ Now we can build a surjective function: $$
F:=f|_{f^{-1}(X\setminus S)} : f^{-1}(X \setminus S) \subset \mathbb{N} \longrightarrow X \setminus S
$$ And by axiom of choice we can change the domain of $F$ by selecting for every $x \in X \setminus S$ only one element of $f^{-1}(X \setminus S)$ . That'll make $F$ a bijective function. Let $\overline{F}$ be that modified version of $F$ and $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ be the modified version $f^{-1}(X \setminus S)$ . Now we have: $$
\overline{\mathbb{N}} \subset f^{-1}(X \setminus S) \subset \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{N} \\
\overline{F} : \overline{\mathbb{N}} \longrightarrow X \setminus S
$$ It's also a proven fact that every subset of a countable set is countable. Since $\mathbb{N}$ is countable, then $\overline{\mathbb{N}}$ is countable. By definition of countable set, we know that $\exists g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \overline{\mathbb{N}}$ bijective. Finally we can create a composition of functions to make a map from $\mathbb{N}$ to $X \setminus S$ : $$
h := \overline{F} \circ g : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow X \setminus S
$$ Since the composition of bijective functions is bijective, $h$ is also bijective and therefore $X\setminus S \subset X$ is countable.","['functions', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

3169174,"Degree of the minimal sufficient statistic for $\theta$ in $U(\theta-1,\theta+1)$ distribution","Suppose $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ is a random sample from the Uniform distribution over the interval $(\theta-1,\theta+1)$ . By the factorization theorem, it is clear that the order statistics $Y_1=X_\left(1\right)$ and $Y_n=X_\left(n\right)$ are joint sufficient statistics for $\theta$ . Now, because $$\theta-1 < Y_1 < Y_n < \theta+1 $$ implies that $Y_n -1 < \theta < Y_1 + 1$ , choosing $\hat\theta \in (Y_n-1,Y_1+1)$ will force the likelihood function to achieve its maximum; that is, $$L(\hat\theta)=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n, \forall \hat\theta\in(Y_n-1,Y_1+1)$$ Typically, statisticians takes the value for $\hat\theta$ to be the midrange of $Y_1,Y_n$ : $\hat\theta=\frac{Y_1+Y_n}{2}$ . Now, because such a value for $\hat\theta$ maximizes the likelihood function, it follows that $\hat\theta$ is an mle for $\theta$ of in $Unif(\theta-1,\theta+1)$ . It is noted in the Hogg, McKean, Craig textbook ""Introduction to Mathematical Statistics"" ( $7^{th}$ edition), however, that even though $\hat\theta$ is an mle of $\theta$ and a function of the joint sufficient statistics $Y_1,Y_n$ for $\theta$ , it does not represent a minimal sufficient statistic; this is because $\hat\theta$ is itself not a sufficient statistic for theta. What I'm wondering here is $why$ $\hat\theta = \frac{Y_1+Y_n}{2}$ is not a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ . By the definition of a sufficient statistic and using the factorization theorem, $Y_1,Y_n$ being the joint sufficient statistics for $\theta$ imply that the likelihood function can be written as $$\prod_1^nf(x_i;\theta) = K_1(Y_1,Y_n;\theta)*K_2(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$$ where $K_1(Y_1,Y_2;\theta)$ depends on $x_1,...x_n$ only through $Y_1,Y_n$ and $K_2(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ does not depend upon $\theta$ ; in our case, $$K_1(Y_1,Y_n;\theta)=\left(\frac1{2}\right)^n \cdot \mathbf 1_{(\theta-1,\theta+1)}(Y_1) \cdot \mathbf 1_{(\theta-1,\theta+1)}(Y_n) $$ Now, although it is clear that we cannot reduce the product of the two indicator functions down any further to any single order statistic $Y_i$ such that an equality remains between $K_1$ and our new function, why is it not the case that $$\mathbf 1_{(\theta-1,\theta+1)}(\frac{Y_1+Y_2}{2}) \neq \mathbf 1_{(\theta-1,\theta+1)}(Y_1) \cdot \mathbf 1_{(\theta-1,\theta+1)}(Y_n)$$ is a valid equality? In proceeding further in my reasoning, let's reference this question . For an overview, this question revolves around the sufficient statistics for the uniform distribution $Unif(-\theta,\theta)$ . In this problem, one can reduce their argument from the joint sufficient statistics $X_\left(1\right),X_\left(n\right)$ down to the single sufficient statistic $max\{X_\left(1\right),X_\left(n\right)\}=Y^*$ . Does it happen to be so that the only thing stopping us from reducing our two-dimensional joint sufficient statistic(s), $\mathbf Y=(Y_1,Y_n)$ , for $\theta$ down into the single-dimensional (""minimal"") sufficient statistic, $Y=Y^*$ , for $\theta$ the fact that our Uniform distribution is not distributed symmetrically about the Y-axis? I could see this argument being the case, but I'd like to be sufficiently (no pun intended) sure of that before proceeding on in my studies. It took me quite a bit of investigating to begin to understand how to work through various operations when working with the indicator function, so I still might a little lost when it comes to the finer intricacies of manipulating this function.","['statistics', 'uniform-distribution', 'order-statistics', 'sufficient-statistics']"

Then $$E^Q[X\mid G] = \frac{E^P[LX\mid G]}{E^P[L\mid G]}.$$ The proof is to show that the integral over any $A \in G$ of the both sides of $$E^Q[X\mid G]E^P[L\mid G] = E^P[LX\mid G]$$ is the same quantity. Starting with the left hand side, $$\begin{aligned}
\int_AE^Q[X\mid G]E^P[L\mid G]dP &= \int_AE^P\left[L\cdot E^Q[X\mid G]\mid G\right]dP \\
&=\int_AL\cdot E^Q[X\mid G]dP

&= \int_AE^Q[X\mid G]dQ

&= \int_AXdQ.

My guess is that he moves $L$ inside the expectation under $Q$ and then applies the law of iterated expectations. However for this $L$ has to be $G$ -measurable which is not generally the case since it is defined of $\mathcal F$ which is bigger than $G$ .","['self-learning', 'conditional-expectation', 'bayes-theorem', 'probability-theory', 'radon-nikodym']"

It is not too difficult to set up an integral which correctly describes this distance: Pick two points $X_1,X_2$ inside the unit disk (one of them can, by symmetry, chosen to be located on the y-axis) and denote by $r_j=|X_j|$ their distance from the origin. Then $r_j$ are indenpendently distributed random variables with probability distribution $dp_j=2r_j$ . Furthermore, the angle between these two points $\phi$ is uniformly distributed with pd $dp_{\phi}=1/\pi$ . From elementary geometry (law of cosines) is easy to see that $D^2=r_1^2+r_2^2-2 r_1r_2\cos(\phi)$ and therefore ( $A$ is a cylinder with $r=1/2, z=1$ ) $$

I have a question about tropical curves, or for the sake of this question, tropical polynomials. When plotted, tropical polynomials appear as a piece-wise tropical sum of monomial terms. More formally, I read here with the emphasis mine: A tropical polynomial is a piecewise linear function of the form $$T(x,y)  =  \max_{(i,j)}[{x i  +  y j  + ci,j}] $$ where the calculation is with the usual arithmetic operations and the maximum is taken over a finite subset of $Z^2$ of exponents of $T$ and $c_{i,j}$ are the real number coefficients of $T$ . A tropical polynomial $T$ defines a tropical curve, which is the set of points $(x,y)$ where $T(x,y)$ is not differentiable. Here are some tropical curves. Clearly, looking at these tropical curve plots, the limit definition of a derivative must apply (not at corners). Why are tropical curves the set of points $(x,y)$ where $T(x,y)$ is not differentiable if they look like these curves? What am I missing here? One thought is that I am misunderstanding the tropical curve definition. I couldn't find anything on the subject, so my question is are tropical polynomials differentiable? Second, if they are differentiable, how do you differentiate a tropical polynomial? Are their derivatives analogous to their non tropicalized counterparts just with piece wise restrictions (ie: power rule)? An example of a tropical polynomial $P$ is given by: $$P(x) = “a\otimes x^3 \oplus b \otimes x^2 \oplus c \otimes x \oplus d""$$ is just a piece wise version of the lines $y=3x+a$ , $y=2x+b$ , $y=x+c$ and $y=d$ according to Wolfram Demonstrations.

3169629,Homotopy equivalence between quotients by free actions,"Let $X,Y$ two contractible spaces.

In particular, we can consider the homotopy equivalence given by the projections $X\xleftarrow{p_X} X\times Y\xrightarrow{p_Y}Y$ Does this equivalence induce an equivalence between the quotient spaces $X/G$ and $Y/G$ ? My motivation is proving that any two little disks operads are equivalent. I'm not going to define what an operad is because it is irrelevant, but we can think of a family of contractible spaces $X_n$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . If each $X_n$ is equipped with a free action of the pure braid group $PB_n$ , then the family $X_n/PB_n$ is called a little disks operad. The way I'm trying to prove it is inspired by this paper (page 3 of the pdf). I believe that my question can be reduced to, given two spaces $X_G$ and $Y_G$ with $\pi_1(X)=\pi_1(Y)=G$ , a homotopy equivalence between the (contractible) universal coverings $\widetilde{X}_G\to \widetilde{Y}_G$ induces a homotopy equivalence $X_G\to Y_G$ . Since, in this case, the unviersal coverings are contractible, $X_G$ and $Y_G$ are both aspherical and path connected, so we get isomorphisms between all homotopy groups, but that's not enought to say they're homotopy equivalent.","['fundamental-groups', 'homotopy-theory', 'covering-spaces', 'general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

I want to ask if my own findings have some official names or no .Also I would like to get help with finding proofs. All of my finding are related to numbers with fixed maximum value, just like in the computer. So the first interesting thing I found is 'bitwise negation' operation for non binary numbers. we already know definition of bitwise negation operator for binary numbers, every 1 became 0 and every 0 became 1 . It is also can be written by this form : $x' = 2^r -1 -x $ $ r=\text{number of bites} $ $ x=\text{variable}$ $ x'=\text{bitwise negated value of variable in binary form}$ This is true , because the sum of the number and it's negative is always equal to $2^r-1$ . I trought ,we could make this operations happen in another number systems simply by replacing base . So the following equation would work : $x' = b^r-1 -x$ where $b=\text{ base}$ So for example , the 'bitwise negation' of decimal number 1250 with 4 digits would be 9999-1250 = 8749 I also 'invented' my own addition pattern, which I will be explaining right now. The new addition system Im calling 'reflow' instread of overflow, because every bit which is overflowing , will be moved to the right side. Imagine having two numbers with 4 bits each . 
Both of them have value of 1000
When you add then in normal addition, it will overflow , and the result will be 0000 1000

1|0000    | this sign means, it is overflowed but in my operation it would reflow, which means following. 1000

I thought I could find the values of $c$ by differentiating $f(x)$ which becomes $6x^2-12x-90$ , and applying the Mean Value Theorem $f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b - a}$ again. $f(b) = 6(-5)^2-12(-5)-90 = 150+60-90 = 120$ $f(a) = 6(8)^2-12(8)-90 = 384-186 = 198$ $f'(c) = \frac{120-198}{-5-8} = \frac{78}{13} = 6$ Then I took $6x^2-12x-90$ again, replaced $x$ with $c$ , and set it equal to $6$ before solving for $c$ . $6c^2-12c-90 = 6  \to 6(c^2-2c-16) = 0$ $\frac{2 \pm \sqrt{2^2-4(1)(-17)}}{2(1)} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{74}}{2}$ or $c = \frac{2 - \sqrt{74}}{2}, \frac{2 + \sqrt{74}}{2}$ But this answer is wrong.

3170039,Identification between von Neumann algebras and measure spaces,"I could show that if $\pi:(X.\mathcal{M},\nu) \to (Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)$ is a measurable map with $\pi_*(\nu)<<\eta$ , then the induced map $\tilde{\pi}: L^{\infty}(Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)\to L^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{M},\nu)$ with $\tilde{\pi}(f)=f\circ\pi$ is well defined. Moreover, I could show that $\|\tilde{\pi}(f)\|_{\infty} \le \|f\|_{\infty}$ . The link to the same can be found here. It is clear that $\tilde{\pi}$ defined above a $*$ -homomorphism. Since $\tilde{\pi}\left(L^{\infty}(Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)\right)$ is norm closed $*$ -subalgebra of $L^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{M},\nu)$ , it is also weak $^*$ -closed, hence a von Neumann subalgebra of $L^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{M},\nu)$ . I am trying to know if the converse to the above holds: Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is a von Neumann subalgebra of $L^{\infty}(X,\mathcal{M},\nu)$ . Then there exists a measurable map $\pi:(X,\mathcal{M},\nu) \to (Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)$ with $\pi_*(\nu)<<\eta$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ is isomorphic to $L^{\infty}(Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)$ as a von Neumann algebra . I came across the theorem of Mackey which is known as Mackey's point realization which says the following: Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\nu)$ be a standard Borel space and let $\mathcal{A}'\subset \mathcal{M}$ be a sub-sigma algebra which is $\nu$ -complete. Then there exists a standard Borel space $(Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)$ and a measurable map $\pi: (X,\mathcal{M},\nu) \to (Y,\mathcal{N},\eta)$ with $\pi_*(\nu)=\eta$ and $\mathcal{A}'=\{\pi^{-1}(E): E \in \mathcal{N}\}$ I am trying to use this theorem to establish my claim. First, since $\mathcal{A}$ is an abelian von Neumann algebra, $\mathcal{A}$ is of the form $L^{\infty}(Z,\mathcal{N}',\eta')$ . Let $\mathcal{A}'=\{\varphi(\chi_E): E \in \mathcal{N}'\}$ , where $\varphi$ is the weak $^*$ isomorphism between $\mathcal{A}$ and $L^{\infty}(Z,\mathcal{N}',\eta')$ . I think that $\varphi$ must take characteristic functions to characteristic functions and that $\varphi(\chi_E)=\chi_{\varphi(E)}$ . If this is the case, then $\mathcal{A}'$ is a sub-sigma algebra of $\mathcal{M}$ . I want to show that $\mathcal{A}'$ is $\nu$ -complete. Towards that end, let $S \subset\varphi(E)$ such that $\nu(\varphi(E))=0$ . The completeness of $\nu$ is not a big deal as I can always complete the sub-sigma algebra by adding the subsets of the measure zero sets but I am not sure if there is any other way of proving this. The only other possibility is that $S=\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(S))$ but why should $\varphi^{-1}(S) \in \mathcal{N}'$ ?

Could someone please provide some insight as to how the recurrence was converted to this form? Also there's the matter of actually applying annihilators to recurrence relations themselves.

The first few terms of the sequence are: $2,5,13,43,61$ Not yet found other terms because I am working with paper and pen, no software. Why the first term is $5$ ? Let be $\pi(x)$ the celebrated prime counting function.
Well 5- $\pi(5)$ = $5-3$ =2 which is a prime. 
If we repeat the same thing with the new prime $2$ , we have 2- $\pi(2)=1$ , which is not a prime. So starting the sequence from prime $5$ , we have the cycle $5\rightarrow 2\rightarrow 1$ . The arrows stop when a not prime is reached. No prime below $5$ has a longer cycle. Infact starting for example from $3$ you get $3-\pi(3)=1$ , which is not prime so the cycle is simply $3\rightarrow 1$ . 
The second term of the sequence is $13$ because below $13$ no other prime has a larger cycle. Infact $13-\pi(13)=7$ , which is prime.  Then $7-\pi(7)=3$ , which is prime and eventually $3-\pi(3)=1$ , which is not prime. So the cycle is $13\rightarrow 7\rightarrow 3\rightarrow 1$ The cycle for 43 is longer so it is the third term of the above sequence.

=\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{\pi(1/2)_m}{8m^3m!}$$ where $(1/2)_n$ denotes the Pochhammer symbol) Therefore, we are able to deduce that $$I_3=\frac{1}{16} \pi  \, _5F_4\left(1,1,1,1,\frac{3}{2};2,2,2,2;1\right).$$ Moreover, $I_n$ can be represented to similar $_pF_q$ terms. But, I'm not familiar with $_5F_4$ . I have no idea how to turn the hypergeometric term into the answer. Some equivalent forms of $I_n$ : $$I_n=\int_{-1}^1\operatorname{Li}_n(x)\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ $$I_n=\int_0^12^{1-n}\operatorname{Li}_n(x^2)\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$$ Any answer without using hypergeometric techniques will be highly appreciated.","['integration', 'polylogarithm', 'definite-integrals']"

3171034,"Is my proof correct? (function composition, surjectivity)","Exercise. Given sets $E$ , $F$ , $G$ and functions $g : E \to F$ surjective, and $f : E \to G$ . Prove that there's a function $h : F \to G$ such that $f = h \circ g$ if and only if the equality $g(x) = g(y)$ , with $x, y \in E$ , implies the equality $f(x) = f(y)$ . My strategy was the following. Right to left. I assume that $h$ exists. Then if $g(x) = g(y)$ , $h(g(x)) = h(g(y))$ . Therefore $f(x) = f(y)$ by definition. Left to right. I assume that the equality $g(x) = g(y)$ , with $x,y \in E$ , implies the equality $f(x) = f(y)$ . Given that $g$ is surjective, $g^{-1}(g(E)) = g^{-1}(F) = E$ . Therefore $f(g^{-1}\circ g(x)) = f(x)$ [ note : I know that $f$ and $g$ 's values at any given point $x\in E$ have the same preimages, but I don't know how to state this more formally.]. I can then define $h: F \to G$ such that $h(x) = f\circ g^{-1}(x)$ , and it verifies the stated condition.","['functions', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"
