520040,A question related to uniqueness principle theorem.,"We know that the equation $ \sin^2z+ \cos^2z=1$ which holds $\forall z \in\Bbb R$ , also holds $\forall z \in\Bbb C$ . This is obvious under the shadow of following theorem: Uniqueness principle theorem :If $f$ and $g$ are analytic functions on a domain $D$ , and if $f(z)=g(z)$ for $z$ belonging to a set that has a non isolated point, then $f(z)=g(z)$ for all $z\in D$ . Can we extend the domain of function $ |\sin z|^2+|\cos z|^2$ from $\Bbb R$ to $\Bbb C$ ? (i.e Can we say that $|\sin z|^2+|\cos z|^2=1\,\forall z \in\Bbb C$ )? I think this extension of the domain from the real line to the entire complex plane is not possible. Since function on left-hand side i.e. $ |\sin z|^2+|\cos z|^2$ doesn't look analytic. And to use above theorem we need both functions to be analytic. How will we show this? Thanks.","['complex-numbers', 'analyticity', 'complex-analysis']"

520147,Necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial $p$ to satisfy $\|x\|\to\infty\implies p(x)\to\infty$?,"I'm looking for a necessary and sufficient conditions (I'm not even sure these exist) for a polynomial $p:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ to be ""radially unbounded"", that is $$\|x\|\to\infty\implies p(x)\to\infty,$$ where $\|{\cdot}\|$ denotes any $p$-norm on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Ideally, I'm looking for conditions in terms of the polynomial's coefficients and degree. For example, if $n=1$ it is straightforward to see that $p$ is radially unbounded if and only if its degree is even and the monomial of highest degree has a positive coefficient. However, I'm struggling to generalise this to arbitrary $n$. Any help would great. Motivation: I'm interested in the above because I'm trying to come up with an automatised test that can decide whether or not the all the sublevel sets of a given polynomial are compact (this is so if and only if the polynomial is radially unbounded). Edit: If no necessary and sufficient conditions (or argument that no such conditions exist in general) are posted before the bounty ends, I'd be more than happy to award the bounty to any answer containing insightful remarks or necessary or sufficient conditions.","['polynomials', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
520195,Please more help me to find the convergence interval and the sum -by using residue theory- of the series.,"The sum is that $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{3n}{2n} x^n$$ First of all, I need to check whether the sum converges or not and if it is convergent, which points? I am using ratio test. $$ \vert\frac{a_{n+1}(x)}{a_n (x)}\vert= \frac{(3n+3)!}{(2n+2)!(n+1)!} \frac{(2n)!n!}{(3n)!}\vert x\vert =\frac{27n^3+ \dots}{4n^3+\dots}\vert x\vert \to \frac{27}{4}\vert x\vert $$ as $n \to \infty$ Thus, the series converges absolutely for $\vert x\vert \lt 4/27$ Now I Will check the convergence of the series for $x=4/27$ For that, I am using Raabe's test $$\lim_{n \to \infty } n(1-\frac{a_{n+1}(4/27)}{a_n(4/27)}) =\lim_{n\to \infty}n(1-\frac{27n^3+54n^2+33n+6}{4n^3+12n^2+8n+2}\frac{4}{27})\gt 1 $$ So the series converges for $x=4/27$ Now, let's check that the series converges or not for $x=-4/27$ In this case, $$a_n(-4/27)=(-1)^na_n(4/27)$$ $$\frac{a_{n+1}(4/27)}{a_n(4/27)}=\frac{108n^3+216n^2+132n+24}{108n^3+324n^2+216n+54}\lt 1$$ So, $a_{n+1}(4/27)\lt a_n(4/27), n=0,1,\dots$ Thus, $a_n(4/27)$is strictly decreasing as $n\to \infty$ To show that $a_n(4/27)\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$ I need to use stirling's theorem. But I dont know how to apply the theorem. Please, can you complete this part by demostrating clearly? By the way, hopefully, so far everything is correct. If you see any mistake, please can you notify/inform me? Thank you. Next, I want to find the sum $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{3n}{2n}x^n= \frac {1}{2\pi i}\sum_{n=0}{\infty}\int_{C_R}\frac{(z+1)^{3n}}{z^{2n+1}}x^n dz= \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}[\frac{(z+1)^3x}{z^2}]^n \frac{dz}{z}=$$ $$\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}\frac{1}{1-\frac{(z+1)^3x}{z^2}}\frac{dz}{z}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C_R}\frac{z}{z^2-(z+1)^3x}dz$$ The Cheney of infinite sum and integration is justified when the convergence of the infinite sum is uniform on the given circle. I need to check that for$|z|=2$ $$\vert \frac {(z+1)^3x}{z}\vert \le 27/4|x|<1 $$ when $|x|\lt 4/27$ So, I can take $R=2$ and $|x|<4/27$ Now, let's evaluate the integral by applying residue theory What is the roots of $z^2-(z+1)^3x=0$ ? But ıcannot calculate, and then I dont know how to decide that I need to find which points' residues. And after here,  I dont know how to find the sum. -I guess I need to find numerical result but how? And what?- Again hopefully so far every thing is correct. Please check the second part and help me to complete final part. I am trying to solve such questions by myself at first time. I showed all what I know as you see.

I am right now reading Strøm's book Modern Classical Homotopy Theory . I have encountered a problem, 5.21b) which concerns cofibrations (see the pictures). One should show that a morphism $i: A \rightarrow X$ is a cofibration iff there is a function $\phi:X \rightarrow I$ such that $A = \phi^{-1}(0)$ is a strong neighborhood deformation retract of $U = \phi^{-1}([0,1))$. In part a) I have no problem, but with b) i.e showing that if we have such a deformation retract, then $A \rightarrow X$ is a bigger problem. One wants to produce a retraction of $X \times I$ onto the mapping cylinder $A \times I \cup X$. They call $T$ the mapping cylinder in the text. Strom gives a picture trying to show how to define it, but I can't understand it properly.

Choose for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ a unit-length vector $x_n \in \mathbb{E}((a-\frac{1}{n}, a])H$, where $\mathbb{E}$ is the spectral measure.  Then $\langle Ax_n,x_n\rangle$ should converge to $\max\sigma(A)$. More precisely, $\int_{\sigma(A)}\lambda d\mu_{x_n,x_n} = \int_{\sigma(A)}\lambda d\langle\mathbb{E}_\lambda x_n,x_n\rangle$. If $\lambda \in [c,d]$ with $[c,d] \cap (a-\frac{1}{n}, a] = \emptyset$, then $\mathbb{E}_\lambda x_n = \mathbb{E}_\lambda \mathbb{E}((a-\frac{1}{n}, a])x_n = 0$.

Then $X$ is locally compact if and only if given $x \in X$, and given any neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there is a neighbordhood $V$ of $x$ such that $\overline{V}$ is compact and $\overline{V} \subset U$. One direction is clear, namely the new formulation implies $X$ is locally compact.  The converse argument goes:  Let $U$ be a neighbordhood of $x$.  Take the one-point compactification $Y$ of $X$, and let $C$ be the set $Y - U$.  Then $C$ is closed in $Y$, so that $C$ is a compact subspace of $Y$.  Then there exist disjoint open sets $V$ and $W$ containing $x$ and $C$, respectively.  Then the closure $\overline{V}$ of $V$ in $Y$ is compact; furthermore, $\overline{V}$ is disjoint from $C$, so that $\overline{V} \subset U$, as desired. (mostly quoted from Munkres').

$K$ here is either $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, as convenient. I am not really comfortable with the terminology, or sure about what I should do. I think I know that having an integral basis $\{w_k\}$ for $K(z,y)$ means that any function in $K(z,y)$ that has no poles can be written as a linear combination of $w_k$. So then I think that 
$$ \{1, y, y^2/z, y^3/z\} $$

Any insights would be appreciated. Addendum. When I compute the eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ of each $M_n$, I obtain
\begin{align}
  \lambda_k = 4\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi k}{n}\right)+\left(\frac{\beta}{n}\right)^2, \qquad k=0,1,\dots, n-1
\end{align}
from which it follows that
\begin{align}
  \Delta_n = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1}\left[4\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi k}{n}\right)+\left(\frac{\beta}{n}\right)^2\right]
\end{align}
which I don't have the foggiest idea of how to evaluate.  I do, however, have a conjecture for the answer which comes from the fact that this limit of determinants came from a path integral which can be computed in other ways.  My conjecture (which I have checked numerically using mathematica to some extent) is

520743,Can a dynamic programming problem be transformed into a linear algebra problem?,"Here is a simple standard economic problem: Let Robin Crusoe have an endowment $w_0$ of lembas bread. She is immortal and discounts at a rate of $\beta$ per period. Each period (from $t=0$ on) she choose to consume some amount $c_t\in [0,w_t]$, and since lembas bread does not decay, $w_{t+1} = w_t - c_t$. Optimize Robin's utility $$\sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(c_t)$$
  subject to the constraint $w_{t+1} + c_t = w_t$. Here $u$ is a concave function, e.g., $u(c) = c^{\theta}$ or $u(c) = \log(c)$. To solve this using dynamic programming, one uses Bellman's principle that each period, a choice will be made given optimal behavior in all future periods. Thus one obtains a series of value functions $v_t$ solving
$$v_t(w_t) = \max_{w'\in [0,w_t]} u(w'-w_t) + \beta v_t(w').$$
This is to say, on the constraint set $\Omega_t = [0,w_t]$, $v_t$ is a stationary point of the maximization operator $$T_uv(b) = \max_{b'\in \Omega_t}u(b'-b) + \beta v(b'),$$
acting on (say) $L^\infty(\Omega_t)$. This is not a linear operator, so tools from linear algebra cannot be brought to bear. I'm wondering if the problem can be ""linearized"" in the following sense: Is there a linear operator $L_u$ acting on $L^\infty(\Omega_t)$ which ""contains the same information as $T_u$"" in the sense that a stable point of $T_u$ will either be an eigenvector of $L_u$ or will lie in the kernel of $L_u$? I've played around with the idea that an integral operator $L$, say, $Lv(b) = \int U(b,b')v(b')db'$, might be able to capture this maximization problem, but I'm afraid I just don't yet have the intuition to see how this should play out.

521179,Generalization of Fatou's lemma for nonpositive but bounded measurable functions.,"Let $(f_n)^{\infty}_{n=1}$ be a sequence of measurable (not-necessarily $\ge 0$). Let $g \gt 0$ be a measurable function with $\int g d\mu < \infty$ (integrable) such that $f_n\ge -g$ a.e. relative to $\mu$ in $E\in S$ ($S$ $\sigma$-algebra). I want to show that $$\int_E \liminf f_n d\mu \le \liminf \int_E f_n d\mu.$$ My attempt:
Let $N_n=\{x\in E; f_n(x) < g(x)\}$. Then $\mu(N_n)=0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ by hypothesis. Let $N= \cup N_n$, it follows that $N$ is also $\mu$-null. With $N$ as above, one can see that $$(f_n+g)\chi_{E \setminus N}\ge 0,$$ everywhere, so applying Fatou's Lemma one gets:
$$ \int_{E\setminus N} \liminf (f_n+g) d\mu \le \liminf \int_{E\setminus N} (f_n +g) d\mu.$$ Since $\liminf g =g, \liminf \int g= \int g,$ and $\int g < \infty$, if I could ""open"" both integrals as the sum of the integrals of each function, I could cancel out the terms involving $g$, yet I can't seem to make it work. I have a semi-linearity theorem for positive measurable functions and a linearity theorem for integrable functions, but the $f_n$'s are neither positive nor integrable. I was told that I should prove a linearity theorem concerning non positive measurable functions whose integrals can be extended real numbers, i.e., we might define $$\int f = \int f^+ -\int f^-,$$ given that said difference is well-defined (we do not get $\infty - \infty$). I can't seem so see the light in the proof of said linearity. Any insight on the issue would be greatly appreciated.","['lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"
521185,A question based on Normal Subgroups,"Question: Let $G$ be a group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. A conjugacy class of an element $α∈G$ is the set $\def\CC{\mathop{\rm CC}}\CC(a)=\{ g^{-1} ag \mid  g∈G\}$. Prove that $H$ is the union of conjugacy classes if and only if $H$ is normal in $G$. My Answer: Prove that if $H$ is normal in $G$ then $H$ is the union of conjugacy classes. Assume that $H$ is not the union of the conjugacy classes. This means that $H$ does not have an element that is of the form $g^{-1} ag$ where $a∈G$. Now, $H$ is normal in $G$, then $gH=Hg$ for all $g∈G$. Hence, for some $g∈G$ and $h∈H$ there exist $h'∈H$ such that $gh=h' g$. This shows that $h=g^{-1} h' g∈H$ which contradicts that $H$ does not have any element of the form $g^{-1} ag$, $a∈G$. Thus, it is proven that if $H$ is normal in $G$, then $H$ is the union of conjugacy classes. Conversely, prove that if $H$ is the union of conjugacy classes then $H$ is normal in $G$. A property of subgroup $N$ being normal to group $M$ is that for all $m∈M$, $mNm^{-1}⊆N$. Must then show that for all $g∈G$, $gHg^{-1}⊆H$. Let $a∈ gHg^{-1}$, then $a=ghg^{-1}$  for some $h∈H$. Now, the element $$a=ghg^{-1}=(g^{-1} )^{-1} hg^{-1}∈H.$$ Thus, by the stated property, $H$ is a normal subgroup in $G$. Therefore it is proven that $H$ is the union of conjugacy classes if and only if $H$ is normal in $G$. Is my answer correct or do i need to modify it? Kindly state if needed.

If $\alpha>r$ then the space $B^\alpha_{p,q;r}$ is trivial in the sense that $B^\alpha_{p,q;r}=\mathbb{P}_{r-1}$, the polynomials of order $r$.
On the other hand, so long as $r>\alpha$, different choices of $r$ will result in norms that are equivalent to each other, and in this case we have the classical Besov spaces $B^\alpha_{p,q}(\Omega)=B^\alpha_{p,q;r}(\Omega)$.
The reason for this is the so-called Marchaud inequalities . My question concerns the borderline case $r=\alpha$. In this case, the situation seems to depend on the index $q$. Can you please confirm or invalidate the followings? Reference suggestions are also very welcome. If $1\leq q<\infty$ and $\alpha=r$, then $B^\alpha_{p,q;r}=\mathbb{P}_{r-1}$. The case $q=\infty$ gives nontrivial spaces.
Namely, we have $B^\alpha_{p,\infty;\alpha}(\Omega)=W^{\alpha,p}(\Omega)$ for $p>1$,
and $B^\alpha_{1,\infty;\alpha}(\Omega)$ consists of those functions whose derivatives of order up to $\alpha-1$ are in $BV(\Omega)$. For the one dimensional case, the second item is proved on page 53 of Constructive Approximation by DeVore and Lorentz.
I have not checked but suspect that the same proof works in multi-dimensions, with $BV(\Omega)=B^1_{1,\infty;1}(\Omega)$ now taken as a definition. Now, what puzzles me is that on page 202 of Rational approximation of real functions by Petrushev and Popov, it is claimed that $B^\alpha_{p,p;\alpha}(\Omega)$ is nontrivial, which seems to contradict the first item above.

Then, I reached the above expectation, but I'm facing difficulty. Can anyone help?","['inequality', 'exponentiation', 'sequences-and-series']"
521500,Question on the proof of the simple Markov property of a Brownian motion,"Today we proofed the (simple) Markov property for the Brownian motion. But I really don't get a crucial step in the proof.
The theorem states in particular that for $s\geq0$ fixed, the process $(C_t:=B_{t+s}-B_{s}, t\geq0)$ is independent from $\mathcal{F}_s=\sigma(B_u, 0\leq u\leq s)$. The proof starts with the remark, that it suffices to show that $\forall n, 0\leq t_1<t_2\dots<t_n$ and $\forall m, 0\leq u_1<u_2\dots<u_m$ the two vectors $(C_{t_1},\dots,C_{t_n})$ and $(B_{u_1},\dots,B_{u_m})$ are independent. But I just cannot figure out why this is true? Anyone got some advise? Thanks a lot!","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'markov-process', 'brownian-motion']"

521546,"definition of ""weak convergence in $L^1$""","I have encountered two definitions of weak convergence in $L^1$: 1) $X_n\rightarrow X$ weakly in $L_1$ iff $\mathrm{E}(X_n\mathrm{1}_A)\rightarrow \mathrm{E}(X\mathrm{1}_A)$ for every measurable set $A$. 2) $X_n\rightarrow X$ weakly in $L_1$ iff $\mathrm{E}(X_n f)\rightarrow \mathrm{E}(X\mathrm{1}f)$ for every (essentially) bounded measurable function $f$. my question: are 1) and 2) equivalent? I see that 2) implies 1) (indicators are bounded), but I have difficulties establishing that 1) implies 2). I tried approximating $f$ by simple functions $f_m$, say, assuming $X_n,X$ are nonnegative for simplicity; the problem: I cannot justify the interchange in the order of taking the limits (first with $n$, and then with $m$). any ideas?

  p.d.f. are unbounded in the neighborhood of $x = 0$:$$f(x) =

521623,A question on multiplicative linear functional on Banach algebra.,"I am reading a book about C*-algebra. But i am confused with some of its content. It says Assume $A$ is a non-unital C*-algebra and $\tilde{A}$ is its unitization (the elements of the form $a+\lambda$). If $\phi: A\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$, is a nonzero homomorphism($\mathbb{C}$ denotes complex field), then $\tilde{\phi}(a+\lambda)=\phi(a)+\lambda~(a\in A$ and $\lambda\in \mathbb{C})$. Let $P(A)$ and $P(\tilde{A})$ denote the nonzero multiplicative linear functional on A and $\tilde{A}$, respectively. Thus, $P(A)$ is a subset of $P(\tilde{A})$. In fact, $P(A)=P(\tilde{A})\cup\{\pi\}$ , where $\pi$ is determined by $\tilde{A}/A=\mathbb{C}$, i.e., $\ker\pi=A$. Since $P(\tilde{A})$ is compact Hausdorff space, we conclude that $P(A)$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space. My question are Does the ""="" in the equation $P(A)=P(\tilde{A})\cup\{\pi\}$ is under the meaning of isomorphism? Is it topological isomorphism? Why? Why does the $P(\tilde{A})$ is compact Hausdorff space implies that $P(A)$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space?","['c-star-algebras', 'operator-algebras', 'banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
