1771879,Why an absolutely irreducible representation is irreducible under all field extensions?,"A representation $G \to\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ over a field $F$ is called absolutely irreducible if it is irreducible over the algebraic closure of $F$ .

1771885,Every subset of a finite set is finite.. confused why this proof is wrong..,"Prop. Every subset of a finite set is finite Proof. Let A,B sets and suppose B is a finite set. Also let $A \subseteq B$ If B = $\varnothing$, A is also $\varnothing$ and is finite. If B $\neq \varnothing$, there exists a bijection f:B->[n] for n $\in N$ Since $A \subseteq B$, the inclusion mapping I: A->B defined f(a)=a for a $\in A$ exists and clearly this is an injection. Then we can have f$\circ$I: A->[n], which is injective. But we know there is a bijection between A and its image in f$\circ$I, meaning that A bijectively maps to the subset of [n], which is finite. Hence A is also finite. I was told that this is a good setup and the part where I said ""the subset of [n], which is finite"" is the meat of the proof..? but was also told that I didn't get the proof right.

1771911,spectrum of a unilateral left weighted shift operator on c0,"The spectrum of shift operators on $\ell_p$ is well-documented, however the spectrum of shift operators on $c_0$ does not seem to be nearly as commonly discussed. Definitions. Let $(e_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ denote the usual basis of $c_0$, and define the continuous linear operator $T:c_0\to c_0$ by the rules
\begin{equation}Te_{n+1}=w_ne_n\;\;\;(n\in\mathbb{N}),\;\;\;Te_1=0,\end{equation}
where $(w_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a strictly decreasing sequence of positive real numbers with $w_1=1$.  It is clear that
\begin{equation}\|T^n\|=\prod_{i=1}^nw_i\;\;\;(n\in\mathbb{N})\end{equation}
so that the spectral radius of $T$ is given by
\begin{equation}r:=r(T)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\prod_{i=1}^nw_i\right)^{1/n}.\end{equation} Conjecture. Let $\sigma_p(T)$ denote the point spectrum of $T$ (defined as the set of all its eigenvalues).  Then
\begin{equation}\sigma_p(T)=D_r:=\left\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}:|\lambda|\leq r\right\}.\end{equation} Discussion. The first answer below observes that
\begin{equation}D_r^o:=\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}:|\lambda|<r\}\subseteq\sigma_p(T).\end{equation}
(From this it follows that $\sigma(T)=D_r$.)  However, I need to show that $\sigma_p(T)=D_r$.  As this is not the case when $w_n=1$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ (see the comments below), I suspect the conjecture is not true even for strictly decreasing $(w_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. If necessary, we could make additional assumptions about $(w_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ so that the conjecture is true. Note. I desire an operator with $0<r(T)<1$, so any additional assumptions we impose on $(w_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ should permit this.

1771968,lottery to pick a group while respecting pairs,"I am running an event that will be oversubscribed, so I'd like to use a lottery to randomly pick the participants that will be accepted.  (For example, 29 people want to attend, but I can accommodate only 17.) The twist is that there are some couples among the people who want to attend, so I must either accept both of them or neither of them. I would like to run this lottery so that any single person has an equally likely chance of being selected, regardless of whether that person is part of a couple or not. Is it even possible to make the lottery fair in this manner?  If so, how should I run the lottery?  If not, what would be the fairest way to run the lottery? I have thought of a few things that don't work. Suppose you take all the combinations (choose 17 from 29 in my example), throw out the ones that do not violate any of the couples constraints, and pick one of the remaining combinations at random with uniform probability.  In general, the number of combinations with a member of a couple is not the same as the number of combinations with an individual. Another simple scheme would be to write each individual's name on a slip of paper, write both names of each couple on a single slip of paper, throw all the pieces of paper in an urn, and draw slips of paper until the total number of names reaches the capacity of the event.  Let's say that if the slip you draw for the last spot has two names of a couple, you throw it out.  This also does not provide the same odds of an individual and one member of a couple being selected. Perhaps there is a way of weighting the combinations in such a way to provide fair odds to an individual?  (Though when there are several couples this could get complicated...)","['combinatorics', 'probability']"
1771970,Visualizing Convergence in Probability,"Let $\{X_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of random variables defined over a common underlying space $(\Omega, \mathcal F,P)$.

My understading is that as $n$ increases, the probability of the $\omega\in\Omega:|X_n-\mu|\geq\epsilon$ will go to zero. They are highlighted in blue in the Omega axis in the figure below. This means, that the highlighted part will shrink as $n$ increases.

1772007,Why are function spaces generally infinite dimensional,"The other day, I was trying to explain some concepts in Fourier analysis and wavelets to my girlfriend (an electrical engineering student) and obviously, the concept of Lebesgue integration came up in the form of the function space $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and I tried to explain that they are infinite dimensional spaces of functions that satisfy
$$
\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \vert f(t) \vert^{2}\, dt < \infty
$$
with a norm given by
$$
\lvert\lvert f(t)\rvert\rvert=\left( \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \vert f(t) \vert^{2}\, dt \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$
and an inner product $ \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: L^{2} \to \mathbb{R}$  which allows us the notion of orthogonality such that given $f,g \in L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$
$$
\langle f,g \rangle=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} f(t)g(t) \, dt =0 \implies f \perp g
$$
I think she understood all of that as well as anyone first exposed to the concepts would but she seemed to have a hard time understanding the ""infinite dimensional"" part. I guess it is something that always seemed intuitive to me but my explanation was that if you imagine a monotone sequence of functions $f_{n}(t)$ which are pointwise convergent to some function $f(t)$, then we have that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \lvert f_{n}(t)-f(t) \rvert \, dt =0
$$
and that in the general case, one could imagine that each term in the sequence represents a scaled element of a basis (though in general, they are not orthogonal) in a Banach space. I also explained that if you imagine a Hilbert space (take $L^{2}$ for the sake of simplicity) then every function can be decomposed into a sum of scaled orthogonal basis functions such that given $f(t) \in L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and an orthogonal basis $e_{i}$
$$
f(t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \langle f,e_{i} \rangle e_{i}
$$
such that 
$$
 \left( \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\left\vert f(t)-\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \langle f,e_{i} \rangle e_{i} \right \vert^{2} \, dt \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}=0$$
and I tried to explain that if we let $i$ approach some large but finite number that we would get closer to the function we desired to approximate but it would still be a different function. I also tried to give her the standard example of the space $L^{2}([a,b])$ being the completion of $C([a,b])$ with respect to the $L^{2}$ norm via a sigmoid function converging to the Heaviside function as an example but she still seems to be struggling with the notion and I really want her to get it.

How can I to derive in $s$ the formula of $f$? I don't know if I understood very well the variation fields things, but if I fix $t=0$, I have that $f(s,0)=c(s)$ is a curve in $M$, then by definition $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial s}(s,t)=df_{(s,t)}(1,0)\text{ or }=df_{(s,t)}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\right), \text{if $(s,t)$ are coordinates in $\Bbb{R}^2$}.$$ So is correct to say that $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial s}(s,0)=c'(s)?$$ Cause, it is very ""plausible"" when we think $\frac{\partial f}{\partial s}(s,t_0)$ like the variation field along to the curve $s\mapsto f(s,t_0)$, for $t_0$ fixed.

In case there's some confusion with the notation, $C_1(0)=$ circle of radius $1$ centered at $0$ in $\mathbb{C}$. We were given several theorems in class for this, but here's one that I think might be applicable: Assume $f(z)$ analytic in domain $\Omega$ and $\Gamma \subset \Omega$ a closed Jordan curve whose interior is contained in $\Omega$ so that $f(z)$ is analytic on and inside $\Gamma$.

1772896,How to understand the notion of a differential of a function,"In elementary calculus (and often in courses beyond) we are taught that a differential of a function, $df$ quantifies an infinitesimal change in that function. However, the notion of an infinitesimal is not well-defined and is nonsensical (I mean, one cannot define it in terms of a limit, and it seems nonsensical to have a number that is smaller than any other real number - this simply doesn't exist in standard analysis). Clearly the definition $$df=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\Delta f =f'(x)dx$$ makes no sense, since, in the case where $f(x)=x$ we have that $$ dx=\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\Delta x =0.$$ All of this leaves me confused on how to interpret expressions such as $$df=f'(x)dx$$ Should it be seen simply as a definition, quantifying the first-order (linear) change in a function about a point $x$? i.e. a new function that is dependent both on $x$ and a finite change in $x$, $\Delta x$, $$df(x,\Delta x):=f'(x)\Delta x$$ then one can interpret $dx$ as $$dx:=dx(x,\Delta x)= \Delta x$$ such that $$\Delta f=f'(x)dx+\varepsilon =df +\varepsilon$$ (in which $\varepsilon$ quantifies the error between this linear change in $f$ and the actual change in $f$, with $\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\varepsilon =0$). I feel that there must be some sort of rigorous treatment of the notion of differentials since these kind of manipulations are used all the time, at least in physics?! I've had some exposure to differential geometry in which one has differential forms, in particular $1-$forms which suggestively notationally ""look like"" differentials, for example $$\omega =df$$ but as I understand it these are defined as linear maps , members of a dual space to some vector space, $V$, which act on elements of $V$, mapping them to real numbers. Furthermore, the basis $1-$forms are suggestively written as what in elementary calculus one would interpret as an infinitesimal change in x , $dx$. But again, this is simply symbolic notation, since the basis $1-$forms simply span the dual space and are themselves linear maps which act on elements of $V$. I've heard people say that differential forms make the notion of a differential of a function mathematically rigorous, however, in my mind I can't seem to reconcile how this is the case, since at best they specify the direction in which the differential change in a function occurs, via $$df(v)=v(f)$$ (since $v(f)$ is the directional derivative of a function $f$ along the vector $v$).

Partial differential equations (AMS, 1997) : Asume $U$ is a bounded open set and that $\partial U$ is $C^1$.

In terms of differential equations, the general solution to $$ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - 5 \frac{dy}{dx} + 6 y = e^{2x} (4x - 2) $$ is $$y(x) = e^{3x} A - e^{2x} (2x^2 + 2x + B),$$ or, if $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0) = 2$ are given, $$y(x) = 2  \cdot e^{3x} - e^{2x} (2x^2 + 2x + 1).$$ There are some major parallels, but there are also differences.

1773236,Is there a clever way to find a smaller number that produces the Euclidean algorithm of given length?,"Is there a simple way to tell if for a given $n$ there is $m$ such that the Euclidean algorithm on $n,m$ runs for a given number of steps, and/or a way to find $m$ efficiently (other than testing all $m<n$ by brute force)? For simplicity, restrict to $m$ relatively prime to $n$. For example, if $n=13$ and we want 1 step, then $m=6$ works: $13=2\cdot6+1$. And for 3 steps $m=7$ works: $13=1\cdot7+5$, $7=1\cdot5+2$, and $5=2\cdot2+1$. Since the algorithm is used to find the modular inverse $m^{-1}$ (mod $n$) the fewer steps it takes the easier it is to find (so in particular few step runs are convenient for making homework problems ☺). Note that it is easy to find pairs for a given length of the algorithm. Since the continued fraction of $n/m=[q_0;q_1,\dots,q_k]$ records the quotients one can take an arbitrary continued fraction of given length, and find $n,m$ by contracting it. Hence an alternative way to ask the question is if there is an efficient way to “parametrize” all continued fractions with a given numerator. If the general question is too hard, what can be said for $n$ prime, and/or small lengths like 2,3,4? It is easy for 1, since $n=q\cdot m+1$ the requisite $m$ are just the divisors of $n-1$. But already for 2 we have to find $m,r$ that simultaneously satisfy $m|(n-r)$ and $r|(m-1)$, which does not look obvious how to do.","['number-theory', 'euclidean-algorithm', 'modular-arithmetic', 'elementary-number-theory']"

Theorem Let $X$ be an LCH (locally compact Hausdorff) space and $\mu$ a positive regular Borel probability measure such that $\mu(A)$ is 0 or 1 for any Borel set of $X$. Then $\mu$ is a Dirac delta. The professor gave a hint to use Zorn's lemma, so I tried considering $Y=\{K\subset\subset X:\mu(K)=1\}$, ordered by reverse inclusion. $Y$ is nonempty since otherwise $\mu(K)=0$ for all compacts of $X$, but then by regularity $\mu(X)=0$, and $\mu(X)=1$ by hypothesis. What I got stuck on is the upper bound for chains part. Let $\{K_\alpha\}$ be a chain in $Y$. I want, of course, to take the intersection as an upper bound. It is compact since it is closed (intersection of closed sets, since compact in H space implies closed) in a compact set, any of the $K_\alpha$ works. It is nonempty since by total ordering the elements of the chain have the FIP and they are compact. But what about the measure? I and the professor both failed to prove it is 1, no matter what we tried. The professor then opened a book to find another argument for what I wanted, which was of course a minimal compact set of measure 1. But the question remains: Can I prove that $Y$ satisfies Zorn? If I take a countable chain I have continuity from above of $\mu$, but what about the uncountable case? Are there examples of spaces where $Y$ does not satisty Zorn's hypotheses? If so, can you provide such an example? If not, can we prove that any chain has an upper bound, and how? Note I am NOT asking whether a positive regular Borel probability which assings either 0 or 1 to all Borel sets is a Dirac delta or not, as answered here . I was trying to prove this and stumbled on an intermediate step I wasn't able to prove valid. Then I found another way, but I want to know if that step could have been done somehow. Repeat: I am asking about the INTERMEDIATE STEP of proving the $Y$ above satisfies Zorn, NOT the theorem I was trying to prove when I bumped into this problematic step. I hope it is clear now. I mean, this got its title edited to asking for the theorem, and I changed the title in a very long but -- at least I thought, but evidently not -- clear title. It stayed up for ages, and now, two or three days after opening a bounty, I get a comment pointing me to the post linked above, which is, for the present question, at least AFAICT, PLAIN USELESS!

So, let $X$ be a projective variety over a field $k$, $G$ a reductive algebraic group acting on $X$ linearly, $\lambda : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow G$ a 1-parameter subgroup, and denote by $\lambda_x : \mathbb{G}_m \rightarrow X$ the map sending $t \mapsto \lambda(t)\cdot x$. Then this map extends to $\mathbb{P}^1$ (by the valuative criterion) - call the extended map $f$. Then Mumford denotes in his book the point $f(0)$ by $\lim_{t \rightarrow 0} \lambda(t)\cdot x$, and says that ""clearly"" it is fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$. I can understand this intuitively as follows: let $t,t' \in \mathbb{G}_m$ then $$\lambda(t) \cdot f(t') = \lambda(t)(\lambda(t') \cdot x) = \lambda(tt')\cdot x = f(tt')$$ Letting $t' \rightarrow 0$ we get that $f(0)$ is fixed, but I'd really like an algebraic proof for this. One can't just plug in $0$ into the above equations since $0 \not \in \mathbb{G}_m$ which is where I am stuck. Also, they proceed to say that $f(0)$ being fixed by the action of $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ implies that $\lambda(\mathbb{G}_m)$ acts on the fiber of the line bundle (associated to the sheaf) $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ at $f(0)$ by a character $t \rightarrow t^r$ for some $r \in \mathbb{Z}$. What I know is that since the action on $X$ is linear the projection map from the line bundle is equivariant so we must have that the action is an automorphism of the fiber, but how is this a charater?

1773759,Can a portion of a hypocycloid be a regular polygon?,"Hypocycloids are curves that generally don't include straight lines. A significant exception is a hypocycloid with 2 cusps, generated by rolling one circle inside another having twice the radius of the first, which will generate a completely straight line and no curved portion. An example and a proof of this special case is shown in this link . Aside from this special case, I want to know if a hypocycloid can be generated such that it contains straight line segments that form the edges of a regular polygon. Specifically, I want to know if a hypocycloid of 5 cusps can be generated so that it contains a true regular pentagon, and if so, what is the ""pen position"" as a function of the radius of the smaller circle. The following images were generated at Spiromath . This first one shows generally what I am trying to accomplish. The radius of the larger circle (A) is 120. The radius of the smaller circle (B) is 72. On the web page, it is defined as -72 to cause the smaller circle to roll inside the larger instead of outside, but the end result is still a radius of 72. The ""pen position"", at the end of the green line is 96 in this example, but I think a value of 106 is closer to generating the desired result. The ratio of 72/120 reduces to 3/5 and the denominator defines the number of cusps while the numerator is related to which ""vertices"" are ""connected"" and the number of revolutions required to generate the closed curve. The second picture is the same as the first, but with several additional variations of the ""pen position"" which was varied by increments of 4 to make the drawing. Notice that increasing the pen position causes the portion of the hypocycloid within circle A to become more and more convex, while decreasing the pen position causes the portion within circle A to become increasingly concave. The portion of the hypocycloid outside circle A (the ""points"" of the star"") are always convex. Since the portions within the larger circle vary from convex to concave as the pen position is adjusted within the range shown, I am postulating that there is at least one pen position at which a significant part of curve becomes a straight line. Simply from trial and error, I am speculating that the straight part may span across the entire arc of the outer circle, or it may only span the length of the edge of the inscribed pentagon, or maybe it's somewhere in between. That's about as far as I can take it. I'd like to see if someone can provide a formula for the ""pen position"" that will generate a pentagon precisely bounded by exactly straight lines, and also show how far those line actually remain straight, or if this is impossible, provide a proof that it is impossible. I am specifically looking for the case of a pentagon, but it would be great to have a general answer that applies to any hypocycloid bounding any regular polygon such as an equilateral triangle, square or other n-gon. UPDATE: I discovered that although I have been using the term hypocycloid, the curve I am actually describing a hypotrochoid. A hypocycloid is a special instance of a hypotrochoid where the pen position equals the radius of the smaller circle. This will not be true for the solution to this question so the proper term for the curve I'm trying to find is a hypotrochoid. The parametric equations for a hypotrochoid are found at MathWorld . I am also adding a new image created with Geometer's Sketchpad. It shows a pair of complimentary hypotrochoids. In this case, the red radius is 3/5 of the green radius and the blue radius is 2/5 of the green radius. Their ""pen positions"" have been adjusted by eye until the curve closely approaches the vertical lines indicated to the left of center. The red hypotrochoid is similar to those in the other images, although the blue one is a viable alternative solution to my problem. Finally, note that I have a good background in algebra and trig, but no analytic geometry or calculus, so answers that don't require calculus are preferred, although an answer that requires calculus is better than no answer at all, although I may need additional explanation in that case.

1773857,Is the general equation for a straight line not considered a linear function in linear algebra? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is calling a linear-equation a linear-function, misnomer or completely wrong? (2 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Is the general equation for a straight line, which we called a linear function in highschool, i.e. $$f(x)=mx+c \tag{1}$$ not considered to be a linear function according to the linear algebra definition that it need to satisfy $$f(\alpha x_{1} + \beta x_{2}) = \alpha f(x_{1}) + \beta f(x_{2}) \tag{2}$$ since the two sides of equation $(2)$ would differ by the constant term if using equation $(1)$ as the definition of $f$? As far as I understand the first equation I posted would be considered an affine function but not a linear function in linear algebra (right?). Are there just (annoyingly) two completely different definitions of what a linear function is or is there a reason that these two definitions have the same name (i.e. are the concepts related)?","['linear-algebra', 'functions']"

1774006,What is $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ going to be?,"Still kind of kind of not getting the hang of this.
When we see $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{2Z}$ for instance, I can relate it to the set of integers modulo $2$. I look at $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and I am not sure. But consideinrg the notaton analogous to $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{2Z}$ I think $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{2Z}=\{0,1\}$. This can be thought as ""the integers that are in $\mathbb{2Z}$"" and ""those that are not."" So $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ means to separate ""the reals that are in $\mathbb{Z}$(i.e. te integers)"" and ""those that are non0integers"". So, is it $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}=\{[x],[y]:[x] \in \mathbb{Z}, [y] \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Z}\}$ so just as in $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{2Z}$, only two distinct elements? integers and non-integers?? Update: I have been commented that there is implicitly defined some equivalence relation $x \sim y \Leftrightarrow x-y \in \mathbb{Z}$. In more general terms, I would still be confused, for instance, when we define a quotient of sets to define a cone on a set $X$, apparently it is denoted $$X \times I/(X \times \{0\})$$ here, I understand it to be all $(x,t)$ where $t=0$ are considered ""equal"" i.e. the equivalnce relation is that $(x,t) \sim (y,s) \Leftrightarrow s=t=0$. In this case it seems, in normal human langauge, it can translated to ""we will define an equivalence relation on $X\times I$, which we symbolize by '$/$' and the specific relation is that, if the pairs $(x,t),(y,s)$ have $0$ on their second entry, we treat them the same"" In other words, any $(x,t) \in X \times \{0\}$ are all the ""same"" here. Unlike the case in $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which we define in the equivalence relation an implicit ""-"" operation $x-y$ going on, the above quotient is rather straightforward. I need not think $(x,t) \sim (y,s) \Leftrightarrow t-s=0 \text{ or } s-t=0$ or somewhat in a similar way. Namely, the cone is about ""whether it's in the set $X \times \{0\}$ or not"" whereas $\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{nZ}$ isn't. It has some additional operation ""-"" defined on it. And to add some more...If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then we have  $G/N=\{\text{left or right cosets of }N\}$, which I can barely relate to the discussion we've had here. Sometimes there are some operations ""$+-\times /$"" defined for an equivalence relation, sometimes there isn't, sometimes it's whether or not it's in the set given, sometimes it's not, sometimes it requires an explicit definition such as for $G/N$. I mean, in general, I have sets $X,Y$. I say what is $X/Y$? Is there a way to rigorously define this? Seems like I can say ""well, maybe all elements of $X$ that are in $Y$ can be seen as equivalent?"" or ""any $x \times y \in Y \Leftrightarrow x \sim y$?"" or ""any $x-y \in Y \Leftrightarrow x \sim y$?"" What are the rules? But they use the same notation ""/"" and further, we are in the world of set theory, basically. In different areas of math I understand the same notation meaning different things sometimes, but this shouldn't be the case, should it? So I don't see how I can distinguish the ""instruction"" of one on another, I simply see no pattern in defining the quotient set/space....","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

1774032,Property similar to connectedness,"Recall that $X$ is connected if $X$ cannot be written as the union of nonempty open sets with empty intersection. Consider the following similar property: $X$ is good if $X$ cannot be written as the union of connected open sets with disconnected intersection. In other words, $X$ is good if, for all open connected sets $A$ and $B$ with $A\cup B=X$, we have that $A\cap B$ is connected. $\Bbb R^n$ is good for all $n$. $S^n$ and $\rm\Bbb RP^n$ are good for all $n\ge2$. In fact, if $H_1(X;G)=0$ for some $G$, then $X$ is good. This comes from the portion of the reduced Mayer–Vietoris sequence around $\widetilde H_0(A\cap B)$. Are these the only good spaces? Or are there good spaces with $H_1(X;G)\ne0$ for all $G$? I have no idea how to approach this..","['algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'connectedness']"
