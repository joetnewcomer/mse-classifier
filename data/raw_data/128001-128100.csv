1960773,Is an expanding map on a compact metric space continuous?,"I got inspired by this question Existence of convergent subsequence to think about the following problem: Suppose you have a compact metric space $(X,d)$ and an expanding map $T:X\rightarrow X$ , i.e. $d(Tx,Ty)\geq d(x,y)$ for every $x,y\in X$ . Is the map $T$ then continuous? Without assuming continuity we already know that $T^n(X)$ must be dense in $X$ for any $n\geq 1$ , since given $z\in X$ the orbit of $z$ must accumulate upon $z$ . But showing continuity has escaped me so far. If there are counter-examples using the Axiom of Choice that also interests me.","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"

1960784,Why can a system of linear equations be represented as a linear combination of vectors?,"I was watching Gilbert Strang's first Linear Algebra lecture, and the very first thing he does is relating the standard view of a system of linear equations as lines -in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of course- (what he calls the row picture) with the notion of taking a linear combination of the vectors given by the columns of the matrix (the column picture). Now, I can see it works in practice to reach the same solution, but I don't intuitively understand why this is the case. A priori, they seem like very different things, and it's mysterious that these two views somehow correspond to each other. Could anyone shed some light on this?

1960878,Exercise problems in Arnold's ODE concerning direction/vector fields under diffeomorphism,"I am stuck with some problems in Arnold's Ordinary Differential Equation. In Page 75, Problem 5, Arnold asked Can a diffeomorphism of the plane map the direction field of the differential equation $\dot{x}=x^2$ into a field of parallel lines? and offers an Answer. It is possible, though an explicit formula is difficult to write out. But I can't see why it's possible. The diffeomorphism needs to map the line $x=0$ to some line $\ell$ in the plane. Since $x=0$ is the asymptote of the integral curves of $\dot{x}=x^2$, while the image of these curves are a collection of parallel lines. So $\ell$ should be the asymptote of these parallel lines, which means they are all the same line, a contradiction. What's wrong with my reasoning above? And why is it possible to find the diffeomorphism? Any help would be appreciated. Additional problem. Our ODE class has specified Arnold as the textbook, but unfortunately, our teacher seems to be not so good at presenting the ideas in the book clearly. To make things worse, exercises in Arnold's book frequently seems confusing(may partly due to translation, which makes sentences unsmooth), and our teacher never explains those exercises. So I'm wondering whether there are sources available about the solution of problems in Arnold's ODE. I googled with no relevant results.

If $A\subset \mathbb{R}$ show that $X_A$ is continuous at each point of $int(A)$ . Are there any other points of continuity? In this problem I have interpreted the characteristic function to be defined as: $X_A: A \to \mathbb{R}$ where $X_A(x)=0$ if $x \notin A$ and $X_A(x)=1$ if $x \in A$ Here is my attempt: $X_A(x)$ is continuous if given a closed set $E$ in the range of $X_A$ then $X_A^{-1}(E)$ is closed in $A$ . E is closed in $R$ and in the range of the characteristic function  only when $E= \emptyset$ $E=\{1\}$ and $E=\{0\}$ because singletons are closed in $\mathbb{R}$ since their compliment is the union of two disjoint open sets. $X_A(\{1\})= x\in A$ and $X_A(\{0\})=x\in \mathbb{R}-A$ . But singletons in $ \mathbb{R} $ are closed so the inverse of a closed set is closed and $X_A$ is continuous. Now for the second part of the question: Suppose $x\in A^0$ , the interior of $A$ . Then $X_A(\{x\})$ is {1} which is closed in $\mathbb{R}$ hence $X_A$ is continuous. Finally: There are other points of continuity, those in $\mathbb{R}-A$ since the image of these points are closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and their inverse image is closed. I feel like I have flawlessly applied the definitions of continuity and given the exact answer the book is looking for!!! But somehow I suspect my feelings betray reality.

Therefore, $$ G(x,a) = \begin{cases} A_1 e^x + B_1 x e^x, \; \;\; \; x<a \\ A_2 e^x + B_2 x e^x, \; \; \; \; x>a \end{cases} $$ Using boundary condition we have $$ \lim_{x \to \infty} A_2 e^x + B_2 x e^x = 0 \implies A_2 = B_2 = 0$$ and $$ \lim_{x \to - \infty} A_1 e^x + B_1 x e^x = 0 \implies A_1,B_1 \; \; \text{can be any numbers}$$ Thus, we have if $x<a$ $$ G(x,a) = A_1 e^x + B_1 x e^x $$ and $0$ otherwise. Now, since $G(x,a) $ is continous at $a$, we have $$ A_1 e^a + B_1 a e^a = 0 \implies A_1 = - B_1 a $$ Thus, we have now $G(x,a) = B_1 x e^x - B_1 a e^x $. Now, $\partial_xG(x,a)$ has a jump discontinuity at $x=a$ of length $1$. Thus, $$ B_1 e^a + B_1 a e^a - B_1 a e^a = 1 \implies B_1 = e^{-a}$$ Therefore, we conlude that $$ G(x,a) = x e^{x-a} + a $$ However, professor say that $$ G(x,a) = - \frac{1}{2} e^{-|x-a|} $$ What am I doing wrong??",['ordinary-differential-equations']

\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\tan(x)}{x} = 1
$$
You can now simplify.
$$
(\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\tan(x)}{x}*\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^2}) = (\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\tan(x)}{x}*\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}) = (1 * \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2})
$$
Now the end result
$$ 
\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2} = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{x^2} = 0
$$
1/3 does not = 0. Therefore there is a discrepancy through special trig limits and L'Hopitals rule. There is the same anomaly with
$$
\lim_{x\to0}\frac{\sin(x)-x}{x^3} = (\text{through L'Hopitals}) -\frac{1}{6} \text{ or (through special trig limits) } 0
$$
On a calculator in graph or table mode as you approach 0 it seems to be 1/3.
But as it turns out, if you get very precise, the limit actually seems to be approaching 0. This happens the same with the graph, it seems to be parabolically approaching 1/3 but if you zoom in to an extreme you see it actually approaches zero. This original work is my own as published on Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 9:51pm. I claim all knowledge credits and fallacies that may come with this discrepancy. But overall please, prove or disprove this, or at least explain why this occurs. Thank you for your time.

In algebraic geometry there is no classifying scheme, but one can define the stack $M$ of vector bundles over schemes. I don't know anything about this stack. Question: Is there a reasonable notion of Chow ring for $M$ so that the algebraic chern classes are obtained by pulling back cycles from $M$ along classifying maps? Or is this for some reason the wrong question? (By algebraic Chern classes I mean what we obtain by formally inverting the generating function built from the Segre classes of a vector bundle, which are an endomorphism of the chow ring obtained by pulling back, intersecting with the canonical divisor in the bundle some number of times, and then pushing forward. I think these algebraic Chern classes can also be defined by twisting a vector bundle until it has enough sections, and then looking at the vanishes scheme of some the minors.)","['homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

1962069,The tea bag problem: probability of extracting a single bag of tea,"Suppose you have a bunch of tea bags in a box, initially in pairs, like these: Let us suppose the box initially contains only joined pairs of tea bags, say $N_0$ of them (thus making for a total of $2N_0$ tea bags). Every time you want to make yourself a tea, you put a hand in the box and randomly extract a tea bag.
Sometimes you will find yourself with a joined pair, in which case you split it, take one for your tea, and put the other back into the box.
If you instead extract a single tea bag (which was already split before), you just take it. Now if you ever happened to be in a similar situation, you will probably have noticed that after a while you will almost always extract single tea bags and seldolmly find doubles (which is not surprising of course).
The question is, what exactly is the probability $p_k$ of extracting a single tea bag, after $k$ tea bags have already been picked? Suppose for this problem that each time there is an equal probability of extracting any of the tea bags, regardless of them being joined with another or not, so that after the first step (in which we necessarily extract and split a double) the probability of extracting a single bag is $p_1=\frac{1}{2N_0-1}$. It is relatively easy, just by computing the values of $p_k$ for the first $k$s, to see that the answer to the problem is quite nice:
$$p_k = \frac{k}{2N_0 -1}.$$
How can we prove this? An interesting variation of the problem is asking what happens if we instead consider the picking of a pair as a single event (instead that as two, as in the above considered case).
With this assumption the previous formula does not hold, as computing the first values of $p_k$ shows:
$$ p_1 = \frac{1}{N_0}, \\ p_2 = \frac{2(N_0-1)}{N_0^2} .$$",['probability']

Define $\mathcal {A}(i,j)$ be the set of all sets $A\subset \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that: $A$ has $k-1$ elements, $i\not\in A$ and also $j\not\in A$. Also, for $A$ in $\mathcal {A}(i,j)$ let $B_{i,j}(A)= \{1,\ldots,n\}\backslash \left(A\cup\{i,j\}\right)$. Consider the following matrix: $$M=\begin{cases} m_{i,j}=0&\text{ if } i=j, \text{ and }\\ m_{i,j}=\sum_{A\in \mathcal {A}(i,j)}\left( \prod_{l\in A} y_l \prod_{l\in B_{i,j}(A)} x_l\right)&\text{ if } i\neq j\end{cases},$$ where $x_l,y_l>0$ for all $l$. Conjecture : $\det(M)\neq 0$ or more precisely, $\mathrm{sign}(\det(M))=(-1)^{n-1}$. For cases that I can compute with 11G memory and 8 nodes in a Linux cluster, the determinant above has sign $(-1)^{n-1}$. In the case $\mathbf{n=4}$, it is easy to check that the even permutations whose corresponding addends are nonzero (i.e., that have no fixed points) have two cycles of length two. For example, (12)(34) corresponds to the term $+m_{1,2}^2\,m_{3,4}^2$ in the expansion of the det. The odd permutations always come in pairs. For example, both (1234) and (1432) correspond to the term $-m_{1,2}\,m_{2,3}\,m_{3,4}\,m_{1,4}$ so we have $-2m_{1,2}\,m_{2,3}\,m_{3,4}\,m_{1,4}$ in the expansion of the det. Now, by definition of $m_{i,j}$, it is easy to check that: 
$$ m_{1,2}^2\,m_{3,4}^2<m_{1,2}\,m_{2,3}\,m_{3,4}\,m_{1,4}+m_{1,2}\,m_{1,3}\,m_{3,4}\,m_{2,4}.$$ Thus, using symmetry, we can show that all positive terms are dominated by the negative terms. For higher $n$, a similar argument should work. I'm trying to 1) identify which are the even permutations (when $n$ is even) and 2) show that there are lots of odd permutations that allow us to kill the terms associated to the even permuations.

Attempt 2 : Now suppose we take the midpoint (say $M$) of 2 of the points (say $A$ and $B$). We can draw an infinite number of lines passing through $M$, out of which only 1 line will pass through $A$ and $B$. Keeping this in mind, we can choose the 3rd point $C$ on any of those infinite lines, excluding the one passing through $A$ and $B$. Now it seems as if the probability will be tending to 1. What is wrong with attempt 2? Or is the answer actually 1 and not $\frac12$?","['geometric-probability', 'probability', 'triangles']"

1963560,Ptolemy's theorem for conics,Ptolemy's theorem says: A quadrilateral can be inscribed in a circle if and only if the product of the measures of its diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of the measures of the pairs of opposite sides. A very interesting fact is that its corollaries are Pythagoras' theorem and the law of cosines. Is there a generalization of this theorem for conics? And would such theorem have more interesting corollaries?,"['circles', 'conic-sections', 'geometry']"
1963563,Finding out probability that the last digit of a product is 5,"If $n$ positive integers taken at random are multiplied together, show that the probability that the last digit of their product is 5 is $$\frac{5^n-4^n}{{10}^n}$$ My attempt: Let $n$ positive integers be $x_1,x_2, \cdots ,x_n$. Let $a=x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdots x_n$. Let $S$ be the sample set. Then $n(S)=10^n$ since there are 10 possibilities for unit digit of each integer. I couldn't proceed from there.

1963581,Probability and Conditional Probability,"Could someone please provide a worked solution to this question? A box contains 5 amber, 7 blue and 9 green balls. Six of the balls are removed from the box at random and without replacement. Find the probability that (a) three out of the six balls are blue; (b) four of the balls are blue and two are green; (c) the second ball to be selected is amber, given that the final ball to be selected is blue. I was wondering if there is a combinatorial argument for these types of problems,  because multiplying fractions here seems a little time consuming and messy. My answers: (a) $\frac{7}{21}\times\frac{6}{20}\times\frac{5}{19}\times\frac{14}{18}\times\frac{13}{17}\times\frac{12}{16}\times\frac{6!}{(3!)^2}$ (b) $\frac{7}{21}\times\frac{6}{20}\times\frac{5}{19}\times\frac{4}{18}\times\frac{9}{17}\times\frac{8}{16}\times\frac{6!}{(4!)(2!)}$ Any help very much appreciated, as always.","['combinatorics', 'statistics', 'probability']"
