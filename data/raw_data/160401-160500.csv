2771727,The `square root of a tensor'; conditions of existence.,"Suppose I have some tensor, for concreteness I will consider a rank 4 tensor with components $R_{abcd}$ where the indices run over 0,1,2,3 (my question arises in a physics context). Under what conditions is the existence of another tensor, call it $G_{abcd}$ , which satisfies $G_{ab}^{~~~mn}G_{cdmn}=R_{abcd}$ guaranteed? Edit : Indices are raised and lowered using the metric tensor : $G_{ab}^{~~~mn}=g^{cm}g^{dn}G_{abcd}$ . Also, for my problem $R_{abcd}$ is the Riemann tensor, and I suppose this would place extra conditions on the existence of a suitable $G_{abcd}$ since it is defined in terms of the derivatives of the metric (in the torsion free case). This probably complicates things quite some, so for now I will leave $R_{abcd}$ to be any rank 4 tensor.",['linear-algebra']

Taking $ln$ both sides
$$ln\left(y\right)=p.ln\left(\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}\right)$$.
$$ln\left(y\right)=p.\frac{ln\left(\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}\right)}{\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}}.\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}$$. Putting $\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}=m$ We have $$ln\left(y\right)=p.\frac{ln\left(m\right)}{m}.\tan{\frac{\pi}{2+p}}$$. As $x \to \infty$ we have $p \to 0$ and hence $m \to \infty$ Hence the limit of $\frac{ln\left(m\right)}{m}$ is $0$. But I am unable to show the limit of other to part of the product.

2771743,Function with Variable Length Argument List,"In programming languages, for instance, in the C language we may define a function with a variable length argument list as follows: double sum(int n, ...) // Returns the sum of 'n' numbers and for example call it as follows: double result = sum(3,2.5,3.5,4.0); // Now 'result' holds the value 2.5+3.5+4.0=10 The problem is, How can we define in mathematics the equivalent of this notion? For example we may try to define $sum$ as: ${sum}: \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{n\}\times \mathbb{R}^n\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ $\forall (m,\vec{x})\in  \bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\{n\}\times\mathbb{R}^n, sum(m,\vec{x}):=\Sigma_{i=1}^m x_i$ And this seems to be a good mathematical definition of $sum$ as a variable length argument function.

The definition of a local basis is supposed to be similar to this: If $B$ is a local basis for $x \in X$ , then every open set containing $x$ (say $A_x$ ) contains at least one local basis element. However, in the latter case, we may not be able to write $A_x$ as a union of some local basis element of $x$ .

2771810,How to show that $\mathscr{P} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{\sqrt{\omega^2}} e^{ - i \omega t }$ is equal to $- \log(t^2)$,"Fix $t>0$ and consider the following Principal Value integral:
$$
\mathscr{P}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d\omega \frac{e^{-i \omega t}}{\sqrt{\omega^2}} = - \log(t^2)
$$ This is the function that Mathematica spits out (and this also matches a result that I'm finding in Lighthill's ``An Introduction to Fourier Analysis and Generalized Functions'', up to a constant). I'm posting because when I check this calculation myself explicitly, I'm getting something strange. This is my method of computation:
$$
\mathscr{P} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{\sqrt{\omega^2}}  e^{ - i \omega t } =  \lim\limits_{\eta \to 0^{+}} \left\{ \int_{-\infty}^{-\eta} \frac{d\omega}{-\omega} e^{ - i \omega t } \ + \ \int_{\eta}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{\omega}  e^{ - i \omega t } \right\}
$$ After switching the variable $\omega \mapsto -\omega$ in the first integral, the above simplifies to:
$$
\ldots = \lim\limits_{\eta \to 0^{+}} \left\{ 2 \int_{\eta}^{\infty} \frac{d\omega}{\omega} \cos\left( \omega t \right) \right\} = \lim\limits_{\eta \to 0^{+}} \left\{ - 2 \mathrm{Ci}\left( \eta t \right) \right\}
$$ Where $\mathrm{Ci}$ is the cosine-integral function. The problem is that I cannot take the limit $\eta \to 0^{+}$. Upon an expansion about $\eta =0$, I find that the above looks like:
$$
\ldots = \lim\limits_{\eta \to 0^{+}} \left\{ - 2 \gamma - \log(\eta^2) - \log(t^2) + \mathscr{O}(\eta^2) \right\}
$$ So it seems to me like the integral has the value $- 2\gamma - \lim\limits_{\eta\to 0^+} \log(\eta^2) - \log(t^2)$. So I get the right functional form in $t$, but I have an extra two constant appearing - one of which is infinite! The $\eta$ seems to be a 'regulator' for the normally divergent integral - how does one get rid of it? Am I using the wrong definition for the Cauchy Principal value in my computation? Mathematica and Lighthill seems to be throwing the $-2 \gamma - \log(\eta^2)$ away somehow. P.S. $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.","['harmonic-analysis', 'integration', 'fourier-transform', 'cauchy-principal-value']"

2772134,Implicit differentiation involving a sliding ladder,"A $5$-foot long ladder is resting on a wall, so that the top of the ladder is 4 feet above the ground and the bottom of the ladder is $3$ feet from the wall. At some time, the ladder is slipping so that the top of the ladder falls at a constant rate of $1 \,\frac{\text{ft}}{\text{min}}$. How fast is the bottom of the ladder slipping away from the wall? I let $y=$ distance along the wall, and $x=$ distance along the ground, so that, $$x^2 + y^2 = 25$$
Therefore, $$2y\frac{dy}{dt}+2x\frac{dx}{dt}=0$$
Initally,
$$2(4)(-1)+2(3)\frac{dx}{dt}=0$$
$$\therefore\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{4}{3}$$
This is all well and good, but my confusion lies in the following analysis: We've established $dy/dt=-1$ and $dx/dt=4/3$, and we know that initially, $$4^2 + 3^2=25$$ Let's say a minute passes, then the vertical distance should decrease by 1 ft, the horizontal distance should increase by $4/3$ ft, and the length of the ladder is always 5 ft. $$(4-1)^2 + (3+4/3)^2 = 27.77...\neq 25$$ I would have thought the ladder would always be 5 ft long, but according to the above, it is now ~5.27 ft long. A second iteration leads to a length of ~6 ft. This ladder seems to be growing in length, which does not make sense. What is going on?","['derivatives', 'implicit-differentiation']"

A graph such as that shown in Fig is drawn where there are N vertical lines and an arbitrary number of random horizontal segments between adjacent vertical lines with the stipulation that no two horizontal segments meet at the same point. The N toys are assigned to the bottoms of the vertical lines, and each child chooses as a starting point the top of a vertical line. From this starting point, the child will trace a path downward.
However, whenever the child runs into a horizontal segment, he or she must turn horizontally, and then turn downward again when the adjacent vertical line is reached.
For example, Fig.(b) shows the path that John follows. It is claimed that no matter how many horizontal segments are drawn, in whatever possible way, no two children will reach the same toy. Prove this claim by induction on the number of horizontal segments drawn.
Image: What I have tried: Not much except I the obvious...
Base case: For N vertical lines and horizontal segment h = 0, we have obvious  result that every child will get different toy. 
Induction hypothesis: Assuming every child gets different toy for h = k segments. 
Induction: Proof for h = k + 1
What I thought is that we could divide the N lines by half then each part of graph will have less than k+1 segments. But this might not necessarily be true since the concentration of all k+1 can be on one side of the graph. It's actually not a HW problem so I do not have any guide to help me through it. Any hint will be greatly appreciated! Thank you for you valuable time!","['graph-theory', 'proof-writing', 'induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2772616,Examples which show $\|\cdot\|_p$ on $L^p$ is not induced by an inner product (Parallelogram law),"Recall the parallelogram law: $$\forall\,x,y\in X, \text{an inner product space, }\|x+y\|^2+\|x-y\|^2=2\|x\|^2+2\|y\|^2$$ This result can be used to check whether or not a norm has been induced by an inner product. Here are some examples: $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ on $\ell^\infty$ does not come from an inner product. To see this, take $x=(1,0,0,...)\in\ell^\infty$ and $y=(0,1,0,0,...)\in\ell^\infty$. But then, $\|x+y\|_\infty^2=\|x-y\|_\infty^2=\|x\|_\infty^2=\|y\|_\infty^2=1$, so that $\|x+y\|_\infty^2+\|x-y\|_\infty^2\neq2\|x\|_\infty^2+2\|y\|_\infty^2$. Thus, this norm is not induced by an inner product on $\ell^\infty$. $\|\cdot\|_1$ on $\ell^1$ does not come from an inner product.
Using the same $x,y$ as for example 1., but regarding them here as
elements in $\ell^1$, notice that $\|x+y\|_1^2=\|x-y\|_1^2=4$, but
$\|x\|_1^2=\|y\|_1^2=1$. Then, putting it all together, we see that
the parallelogram law isn't satisfied, so that this norm is not
induced by an inner product on $\ell^1$. These are some nice, easy to remember, examples which can be used with the parallelogram law to show that the respective norm is not induced by an inner product. Since the standard norm on $\ell^2$ is induced by an inner product, there isn't much to show with the Parallelogram law in the vein we did above. But what about the Lebesgue measure, $L^p$, spaces for when $p\in[1,\infty)$? As well as in the case for $L^\infty$? Again, the norm on $L^2$ is induced by an inner product, but what about those $L^p$ spaces which are not? Which are those specific $L^p$ spaces whose norms are not induced by an inner product? And which simple, easy to remember, examples do you keep in your backpocket, ready to use in conjunction with the parallelogram law to show that?","['normed-spaces', 'lebesgue-measure', 'functional-analysis', 'measure-theory', 'inner-products']"
2772654,Why does the space of SPD matrices form a differentiable manifold?,"Disclaimer: I am not a mathematician, just a young neuroscientist trying to understand a paper. So, please forgive me if I have horribly misunderstood something. In order to understand this paper $^\color{magenta}{\star}$ that involves using a Riemannian kernel for a support vector machine, I am trying to understand some of the maths behind part of the methods. I am still not entirely sure what a differentiable manifold is, despite having watched a number of video lectures on the topic (It's a topological space which is locally homomorphic to Euclidean space - with continous transfer functions?). But more importantly: the paper states that the space of symmetric positive definite matrices forms a differentiable manifold. This seems important as the we need to calculate the distances between covariance matrices (which by definition live in the SPD space) in order for the SVM to perform well. So, to me, it seems that the author's of the paper achieved impressive SVM classification results because their similarity (or distance) measure was more suited to the space in which they were working. ie a Riemannian kernel in a differentiable manifold.  Is it just a happy coincidence that the space of SPD matrices forms this.. mathematical object within which we can perform better similarity measures? I suppose my entire confusion can be summed up as: Why does a collection of a specific type of matrix (SPD) form this other topological space with specific properties that make it more efficient for measuring distances between points (matrices) in the space? $\color{magenta}{\star}$ Alexandre Barachant, Stéphane Bonnet, Marco Congedo, Christian Jutten, Classification of covariance matrices using a Riemannian-based kernel for BCI applications [ hal-00820475 ], Neurocomputing, Volume 112, July 2013.","['riemannian-geometry', 'matrices', 'positive-definite', 'symmetric-matrices', 'manifolds']"

I've proved that we can reduce the problem to the first quadrant by seeing that $x=0$ and $y=0$ are orbits of the system, so by uniqueness of solutions, we cannot have a periodic orbit crossing them. Furthermore, we can change the variables to reduce it to the first quadrant. Now we have to use the Bendixon-Dulac Theorem, with $B(x,y)$ the function they gave to us.

Let $|\ |$ denote another norm on $E$ that is weaker that $\|\ \|_E$ , i.e., $|x|\leqslant M\|x\|_E\ \forall x\in E$ . Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that $$\|x|_E\leqslant C\left(\|Tx\|_F+|x|\right)\quad\forall x\in E.$$ Hint: Argue by contradiction In the back of the book there is an answer to the exercise and I am trying to fill in the details, however there is a very important step here Without loss of generality we may assume that $T$ is surjective (otherwise, replace $E$ by $R(T)$ ). Assume by contradiction that there is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $E$ such that $$ \|x_n\|_E=1\quad\text{ and } \|Tx_n\|_F+|x_n|<1/n.$$ By the open mapping theorem there is a constant $c>0$ such that $T(B_E)\supset cB_F$ . Since $\|Tx_n\|_F<1/n$ , there exists some $y_n\in E$ such that $$Tx_n = Ty_n \quad \text{ and } \|y_n\|_E < 1/nc. $$ Write $x_n+y_n+z_n$ with $z_n\in N(T)$ , $\|y_n\|_E\to 0$ , and $\|z_n\|_E\to1$ .

This is impossible, since the norms $\|\ \|_E$ and $|\ |$ are equivalent on the finite-dimensional space $N(T)$ . which I do not understand. Why can we assume $\|y_n\|_E \leq \frac{1}{nc}$ ? The open mapping provides us with the inequality $\|y_n\|_E \leq \frac{1}{c}$ since $cB_F \subseteq T(B_E)$ , but without the 'n' in the denominator we can no longer assume that $y_n \to 0$ and we need that to get the contradiction.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces', 'operator-theory']"

2772819,Berry-Esseen Smoothing Inequality from Feller Volume 2; Lemma 2 XVI.4,"Fellow Feller fans, I have a question concerning Fellers (An introduction to probability and its Applications, Volume 2 1971) treatment of the Berry-Esseen inequality obtained by smoothing which is Lemma 2 on page 538.
Specifically it is about going from (3.11) to (3.12) on page 538.
To make the question (more or less) self contained denote by $X\sim F_X$, $Y\sim F_Y$ and $Z \sim F_Z$ three absolutely continuous and independent random variables, where $Z$ has a density $f_Z(x) = \frac{1-\cos(Tx)}{\pi T x^2}$ for $T > 0$.
Characteristic functions are denoted by $C_X$, $C_Y$ and $C_Z$.
For example $C_X(\zeta) = \mathbb{E}[\exp(i \zeta X)]$.
With the inverse transformation for densities and $C_{X+Z}(\zeta)=C_X(\zeta)C_Z(\zeta)$ we then have
\begin{align}\tag{3.11}
f_{X+Z}(x) - f_{Y+Z}(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-i \zeta x} \left[C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)\right] C_Z(\zeta) d\zeta.
\end{align}
This is (3.11) in Feller on page 538 (where $C_Z(\zeta) = \omega_T(\zeta)I_{[-T,T]}(\zeta)$ in Fellers notation).
The other relevant (in-) equalities are
\begin{align}\tag{3.12}
F_{X+Z}(y) - F_{Y+Z}(y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-i \zeta y} \frac{C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)}{-i\zeta} C_Z(\zeta) d\zeta.
\end{align}
and just for reference the final goal (in combination with Lemma 1, pager 537)
\begin{align}\tag{3.13}
\left\vert F_{X}(y) - F_{Y}(y) \right\vert \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-T}^T  \left\vert \frac{C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)}{\zeta}\right\vert d\zeta + \frac{24 m}{\pi T},
\end{align}
where $m$ is constant depending only on $F_Y$. Now to the question. Starting from (3.11) we are interested in going to (3.12) and hence need to integrate with respect to $x$.
There are now two options: 1) What I would do: Integrate  both sides of (3.11) with respect to $x$. Then we have
\begin{align}
F_{X+Z}(y)-F_{X+Z}(a) - F_{Y+Z}(y)+F_{Y+Z}(a) &= \int_{a}^y f_{X+Z}(x) - f_{Y+Z}(x) dx\\
&= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{ie^{-i \zeta x}}{\zeta} \Big|_{x=a}^{x=y} \left[C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)\right] C_Z(\zeta) d\zeta.
\end{align}
On the right the factor $\frac{ie^{-i \zeta x}}{\zeta} \big|_{x=a}^{x=y}$ in the integral is related to $e^{-i \zeta x}$ when integrating. To deal with this factor (because there is no convergence for $a \to -\infty$) take absolute values on both sides, pull them into the integral on the right. Now we have $\left\vert \frac{ie^{-i \zeta x}}{\zeta} \big|_{x=a}^{x=y} \right\vert \leq \frac{2}{\vert \zeta \vert}$ for all $y$ and $a$. Now we can take the limit $a \to -\infty$ to get
\begin{align}\tag{3.12*}
\left\vert F_{X+Z}(y) - F_{Y+Z}(y) \right\vert \leq \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} 2 \left\vert \frac{C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)}{\zeta}\right\vert \vert C_Z(\zeta) \vert d\zeta.
\end{align} This method does not give (3.12) - the absolute values are already in play, but it is still good enough to get to something like (3.13). However, this yields an additional factor of $2$ that is not present in Fellers treatment.
I have finally
\begin{align}\tag{3.13*}
\left\vert F_{X}(y) - F_{Y}(y) \right\vert \leq \frac{2}{\pi} \int_{-T}^T  \left\vert \frac{C_X(\zeta) - C_Y(\zeta)}{\zeta}\right\vert d\zeta + \frac{24 m}{\pi T}.
\end{align} 2) What Feller does: Essentially guess the anti-derivative of (3.11) and argue that there are no integration constants. Then one gets (3.12) directly (""Integrating with respect to $x$ we obtain"" (3.12) in Fellers words) and this saves the factor $2$ that we otherwise buy in. But I don't really understand the argument: ""No integration constant appears because both sides tend to $0$ as $\vert x \vert \to \infty$, the left because $F(x) - G(x) \to 0$, the right by the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma 4 of XV, 4."" My question now is how Fellers argument can be formalized (or explained in more detailed).
I would like to get (3.12) instead of (3.12*) to save the factor $2$ in (3.13) versus (3.13*).","['characteristic-functions', 'statistics', 'inequality', 'probability']"

  Let $N$ be the number of coupons you need, and show that (a) $\mathbb E[N] = n\sum^n_{k=1}\frac{1}{k} \sim n\log n$ for large $n$, (b) there is a constant c such that $\operatorname{Var}[N] \sim cn^2$ for large $n$. What is $c$? This is a famous problem called the collector's problem . Here follows one solution for part a) of the question: Let $N$ denote the (random) number of coupons that we need to purchase in order to complete our collection. We can write $N = X_1 + X_2 + . . . + X_n,$ where for any $k = 1, 2, . . . , n,$ $X_k$ denotes the additional number of coupons that we need to purchase to pass from $k − 1$ to $k$ different types of coupons in our collection. Trivially $X_1 = 1$ and, since we are considering the case of a uniform distribution, it follows that when $k$ distinct types of coupons have been collected, a new coupon purchased will be of a distinct type with probability equal to $\frac{n-k}{n}$. By the independence assumption, we get that the random variable $X_k$, for $k ∈ {2,...,N}$, is independent from the other variables and has a geometric law with parameter $\frac{n-k+1}{n}$. The expected number of coupons that we have to buy to complete the collection will be therefore $$\mathbb{E}[N]=\mathbb{E}[X_1]+\mathbb{E}[X_2]+...+\mathbb{E}[X_n] \tag{1}$$ $$=1+\frac{n}{n-1}+\frac{n}{n-2}+...+\frac{n}{2}+n \tag{2}$$ $$=n\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k}. \tag{3}$$ I don't understand this solution.

2772895,"Meaning of ""the weakest topology such that <blank> is continuous""","I've noticed one classical way of defining certain topologies is to define them as the ""weakest"" (or coarsest) topology such that a certain set of functions is continuous.

The weak*-topology on a Banach space $X$ is the weakest topology such that the evaluation map (the natural isomorphism from $X$ to $X^{**}$ , $J(x)(\phi) = \phi(x)$ ) is continuous. I have a very poor intuition behind what these ""mean"". When I look at the definition of a topology, the ones that make the most sense to me are the ones in which the open sets (or at least a base of open sets) are explicitly constructed, as in the Euclidean topology (or a general metric space topology, or a norm induced topology). I get a little stuck when the definition of the topology is given in some ""abstract"" sense, where the open sets are ""chosen"" to satisfy a certain other property. How am I supposed to visualize the open sets in these spaces, or work with them? If $\tau$ is the weakest topology on $X$ such that $f : X\to Y$ is continuous, is it correct to imagine a base for the open sets to be the preimage of all open sets in $Y$ under $f$ ? This follows directly from the definition of a continuous function on topological spaces. Is this always the coarsest topology? Furthermore, what benefit do these topologies provide?

Then, every element in $S$ has finite order, since the order is definided as the cardinality of such set. The question is, Should $S$ be group?

$$C : r_C(t) = (x,2x,1) \; x \in \mathbb R$$ And then we yield the system :

Let $d>2$. Let $f \in W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^d)$ where $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $2 \le k \le d-1$ be fixed. Suppose that $\det df>0$ a.e. and that $\bigwedge^k df$ is smooth. Is $f$ smooth? Partial answer: If $k,d$ are not both even and $\bigwedge^k df \in \text{GL}(\bigwedge^{k}\mathbb{R}^d)$ , the answer is positive. (see details below). I am not sure  the answer remains positive when $k,d$ are both even, since in that case, $\bigwedge^k A=\bigwedge^k (-A)$ and both $A,-A \in \text{GL}^+(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Thus the minors cannot distinguish beween a map and its negative, so theoretically $df$ could ""switch"" between ""something"" and its negative, thus violating smoothness. It would be interesting to find a concrete counter example for smoothness in this case. The smallest dimensions are $d=4,k=2$. Every possible counter-example must have non-continuous weak derivatives . When $k,d$ are not both even, $\bigwedge^k df$ uniquely determines $df$ (assuming $\det df>0$). That is, if $A,B \in \text{GL}^+(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $\bigwedge^k A=\bigwedge^k B$, then $A=B$. Indeed, write $S=AB^{-1}$. Then we have $\bigwedge^k S=\text{Id}_{\bigwedge^k \mathbb{R}^d}$. This implies, any $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is $S$-invariant, hence $S$ is a multiple of the identity , i.e. $S=\lambda \text{Id}$, which then forces $\lambda^k=1$, so $\lambda=\pm 1$. If $k$ is odd, then $\lambda=1$, and $S=\text{Id}$. If $d$ is odd, then the requirement $S \in \text{GL}^+(\mathbb{R}^n)$ forces $\lambda^d=\det S >0$, so again $S=\text{Id}$. We showed that the map $\psi: A \to \bigwedge^k A$ is a smooth injective homomorphism of Lie groups $\text{GL}^+(V) \to \text{GL}(\bigwedge^{k}V)$. Set $ S=\text{Image} (\psi)$. Since $S$ is an embedded submanifold , $\psi:\text{GL}^+(V) \to S$ is a diffeomorphism. Now composing $x \to \bigwedge^k df_x$ with the smooth inverse of $\psi$ finishes the job.

2773630,Direct proof that the wedge product preserves integral cohomology classes?,"Let $H^k(M,\mathbb R)$ be the De Rham cohomology of a manifold $M$. There is a canonical map $H^k(M;\mathbb Z) \to H^k(M;\mathbb R)$ from the integral cohomology to the cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbb R$, which is isomorphic to the De Rham cohomology. As a previous question already revealed, the images of this map are precisely the classes of differential $k$-forms $[\omega]$ that yield integers when integrated over a $k$-cycle $\sigma$, $$ \int_{\sigma} \omega \in \mathbb{Z}  \quad\text{ whenever } d\sigma = 0$$ Let us call them ""integral forms"". Motivated by the cup product on cohomology, my question/request is the following: Give a direct proof that the wedge product $[\omega\wedge\eta]\in H^{k+l}(M,\mathbb R)$ of two integral forms $\omega\in \Omega^k(M)$ and $\eta\in \Omega^l(M)$ is again an integral form. This should be true because the cup product is mapped to the wedge product, but the point of the exercise is to prove this statement directly, without constructing the singular cohomology $H^k(M,\mathbb Z)$ or homology first. Maybe I also have to make sure that the condition of being an integral form is something that can be ""checked effectively"" without singular homology; this might be subject to a new question.","['algebraic-topology', 'differential-forms', 'homology-cohomology', 'differential-geometry']"

Then I need the bound $$

2773695,Possible range of a function,"Suppose there is a function, 
$$f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x^2}$$
And we have to find its domain and range.
So first I calculated the domain:- Since the denominator of f(x) is always greater than 0 for all x belongs to Real numbers(R).
So the domain of the function is the set of real numbers i.e.
$$domain(f) = R$$
Then to find the range I did the following:-
Let $$y = f(x)$$. Then,
$$y = f(x)$$
$$y = \frac{x}{1 + x^2}$$
$$x^2y-x+y=0$$
$$x^2-\frac{x}{y}+1=0$$
Then, By quadratic formula:-
$$x=\frac{\frac{1}{y}\pm\sqrt{\frac{1}{y^2}-4}}{2}$$
Solving which we get:-
$$x=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4y^2}}{2y}$$
Clearly x will get real values, if
$$1-4y^2\ge0$$ $$and$$ $$y\ne0$$
Implies that, $$4y^2-1\le0 \quad \text{and} \quad y\ne0$$
Implies that, $$y^2-\frac{1}{4}\le0 \quad \text{and} \quad y\ne0$$
Implies that, $$(y-\frac{1}{2})(y+\frac{1}{2})\le0 \quad \text{and} \quad y\ne0$$
Implies that, $$-\frac{1}{2}\le y\le\frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad y\ne0$$
Implies that, $$y\in \left[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right] - \{0\}$$ This means that the set of range contains all real values from -1/2 to 1/2 excluding 0 and the domain contains all the real values.
Since the domain contains all the real values so when we put x = 0 in f(x) then we get 0 but the set of range does not contain 0.
How is this possible, what am I missing?
Any help is appreciated.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
2773750,Are eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix orthonormal or just orthogonal?,"For every matrix $A$ we have
$$AV=V\Lambda\rightarrow A=V\Lambda V^{-1}$$

$$A^T=({V^{-1}})^T\Lambda V^T\rightarrow A=({V^{-1}})^T\Lambda V^T$$
where symmetry of $A$ results in $A^T=A$, and $\Lambda^T=\Lambda$ because it is diagonal. Comparing these two yields
$$V^{-1}=V^T\rightarrow V^TV=I$$
which is the definition of the orthogonal matrix. That means not only eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal but also they are orthonormal, i.e., they are unit vector with length 1 and orthogonal.

I'd like to fill the entire frame with the rotated video clip, while cropping as little as possible. If I rotate the video without any other adjustments, the result looks like this: In this image, the rotated video clip is the black rectangle, while the canvas/frame is the blue rectangle. These rectangles are guaranteed to have the exact same dimensions - width, height, area, etc. The angle of rotation may vary, and it may rotate in either direction (positive or negative), so I need to be able to account for it in my calculations. The corners of the rotated video clip will have to be cropped - I wish to minimize this. Additionally, as you can see in the image, the video clip doesn't fill the entire frame anymore - the corners of the canvas are empty - so I need to zoom the video clip to make it larger and fill the entire frame. So I need to calculate the minimum ratio/percentage I need to scale the video clip up, in order to fill the entire frame. In other words, the smallest value by which to multiply the dimensions of the black rectangle, so that the blue rectangle will fit inside of it exactly. And I also need to calculate the resulting $(x,y)$ coordinate of the top-left corner of the rotated video clip, in relation to the top-left corner of the frame.

2773974,"$x^n = x$ implies commutativity, a universal algebraic proof?","I read in an answer on MO that Nathan Jacobson had given a universal algebraic proof that a ring satisfying the equation $x^n=x$ is commutative. The sketch given in the answer is very clear : wlog one may assume that $R$ is subdirectly irreducible, as a result of a general result in universal algebra (that is, it has a minimum nonzero ideal). Then one proves that a subdirectly irreducible ring satisfying the equation is a finite (skew, a priori) field, and one concludes from Wedderburn's theorem that it's commutative. But I'm having trouble with the interesting step, that is A subdirectly irreducible ring satisfying the equation $x^n=x$ for some $n\geq 2$ is a finite division ring I had the folliwing idea : since $R$ has no nilpotent elements it should be a subdirect product of integral domains satisfying the same equations - however I know this property for commutative rings, and it relies on the well-known fact that $\displaystyle\bigcap\{p, p\in \mathrm{Spec}R\} = \{x, x$ is nilpotent $\}$ - and I don't know whether this is true for noncommutative rings. As a matter of fact I'm pretty much convinced that it's not true (in $M_n(K)$, $K$ a field, $n\geq 2$, the set of nilpotent elements isn't a bilateral ideal - indeed there are no nontrivial ones). So unless this idea can be saved by the specifics of the situation, I can't go any further with it. What I also noticed (I don't know if that can help though) is that $I^2 = I$, if $I$ denotes the minimum nonzero ideal. I can also sort of make a connection with Wedderburn's theorem by studying the case where $Z(R)$ (the center) is a field; and so $R$ is a $Z(R)$-vector space. Then, it's a finite field. I can't yet see why $Z(R)$ would be finite dimensional (this would probably help a lot). Am I anywhere near the right direction ? Can anyone give some hints to solve this ? (If possible - I know sometimes it's not- I'd rather see some hints than a full solution; and also if someone has read the article in question and saw that the proof in question was longer than what an MS answer can suggest, I'd also like to know haha) EDIT: Here's the MO question : https://mathoverflow.net/questions/30220/abstract-thought-vs-calculation The answer I'm mentioning should be recognizable","['universal-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'noncommutative-algebra']"
