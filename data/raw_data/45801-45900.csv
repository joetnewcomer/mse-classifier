458421,"Show $\partial _x \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x,y)}P(s,t)ds + Q(s,t)dt = P(x,y)$","There is a theorem from advanced calculus that I'm trying to prove. Suppose $P(x,y)$, $Q(x,y) \in C^2$ on a simply connected domain $D$, and suppose that $P_y = Q_x$ (i.e. $\omega = Pdx + Qdy$ is closed), we have that $$\partial _x \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x,y)}P(s,t)ds + Q(s,t)dt = P(x,y)  \\
\partial _y \int_{(x_0, y_0)}^{(x,y)}P(s,t)ds + Q(s,t)dt = Q(x,y).$$ (Note the integral is well-defined since $\omega$ closed means that the integral is path-independent.)

458434,Understanding Basic Categorical Duality with an Example from Group Theory,"I am trying to understand the concept of duality in category theory, but I am having a problem, well illustrated by the following situation. Let $H$ be any nontrivial subgroup of the alternating group $G=A_5$. Thus there exists a group monomorphism $H \to G$. By duality, there exists a group epimorphism $G \to H$. This implies $H \cong G/N$ for some normal subgroup $N$ in $G$. This is ridiculous, as $A_5$ is simple. What is wrong here?","['category-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

458455,Show that a set of projectors summing to the identity implies mutually orthogonal projectors,"The general setting is the study of positive operator measures in quantum mechanics ,
instead of the projector operator measures.
Going from the PVM to the POVM is just saying that our bunch of operators are not pairwise orthogonal.
SO the question is: In a matrix algebra or the bounded operators on a Hilbert space, how to prove that if a bunch of projectors sums to the identity [or their sum is less than or equal to the identity], they must be mutually orthogonal ? Can we prove this when we only know that a projector is an operator $p$ such that $
p = p^* = p^2
$ a projector is always positive, i.e., $$
\forall\,\,{ \lvert \psi \rangle} \qquad 0 \leq  \langle\psi \lvert P \lvert  \psi \rangle.
$$ I cannot find a proof that if $p, q$ are (positive) projectors then $pq$ is again positive. We know that in general, if two operators commute and are positive, then their product is again positive.
But how the constraint by the identity forces them to be orthogonal in our setting ? My book on quantum mechanics says, $
\sum_j p_j \leq \text{Id} \iff \forall{ i \neq j} \quad p_i \leq \text{Id} - p_j
$ without proof unfortunately.","['c-star-algebras', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'quantum-mechanics']"

What is the Laurent series for $\log z$ centered at 0, if exist?

458711,"Solution of $y'+2y=g(t)$, $y(0)=0$, for a given $g(t)$ having a jump discontinuity","The differential equations book that I'm reading states the following: Linear differential equations sometimes occur in which one or both of the functions $p$ and $g$ have jump discontinuities. If $t_0$ is such a point of discontinuity, then it is necessary to solve the equation separately for $t < t_0$ and $t > t_0$. Afterward, the two solutions are matched so that $y$ is continuous at $t_0$; this is accomplished by a proper choice of the arbitrary constants. Then it asks to solve the following initial value problem: $y' + 2y = g(t),\ y(0) = 0$ where $g(t)=\begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if $0 \leq t \leq 1$} \\ 0 & \text{ if $t > 1$}\end{cases}$ For $0 \leq t \leq 1$: $$y' + 2y = 1$$ The integrating factor is $e^{2t}$: $$(ye^{2t})' = e^{2t}$$ $$ye^{2t} = \dfrac{e^{2t}}{2} + C_1$$ Since the interval $0 \leq t \leq 1$ contains the initial point $t = 0$, the constant $C_1$ is determined by the initial condition $y(0) = 0$: $0e^{0} = \dfrac{e^{0}}{2} + C_1$. So, $C=-\dfrac{1}{2}$ Therefore, the solution for this interval is $y = \dfrac{1}{2}\left(1-e^{-2t}\right)$. For $t > 1$: $$y' + 2y = 0$$ The integrating factor is $e^{2t}$: $$(ye^{2t})' = 0$$ $$ye^{2t} = C_2$$ $$y = C_2e^{-2t}$$ The above solution should be ""matched"" with the previous one at $t=1$. So, setting $t = 1$ and equalling both solutions gives the value of $C_2$: $$\dfrac{1}{2}\left(1-e^{-2}\right) = C_2e^{-2}$$ $$C_2 = \dfrac{1}{2}(e^2-1)$$ So, the second solution becomes $y = \dfrac{1}{2}(e^2-1)e^{-2t}$ Now, a continuous function can be created, joining these two solutions gives the general solution: $$y(t)=\begin{cases} \dfrac{1}{2}(1-e^{-2t}) & \text{ if $0 \leq t \leq 1$} \\ \dfrac{1}{2}(e^2-1)e^{-2t} & \text{ if $t > 1$}\end{cases}$$ This attempt is correct, because this is the answer given by the book. But, although the function above is continuous at $t=1$, it is not differentiable, since the derivative of $y(t)$ is not continuous at $t=1$ (there is a ""kink"" at $y(1)$). So, why is the function above a solution for $t\geq 0$? Shouldn't a solution be differentiable everywhere?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'continuity']"

Then use a calculator and the Euclidean Algorithm to find a factor of $n$. What is the smallest $a$ such that $a^2 - n $ is a square? Hi everyone, thanks in advance for the help. Here is what I have so far, first part seemed reasonably easy: Given $3306^2 - n = 11\cdot 17^3$ and $3834^2 - n = 11^3\cdot 13^2 \cdot 17$ Then  $(3306^2 - n)(3834^2 - n) = (11\cdot 17^3)(11^3\cdot 13^2 \cdot 17) $ so, $(3306 \cdot 3834)^2 - (11^2 \cdot 13 \cdot 17^2)^2 = 3306^2n + 3834^2n $ therefore, LHS is divisble by n and = $ 3306^2 + 3834^2 $ The next part, I used the Euclidean Algorithm, and as I understand it so far, it takes two arguments, so I used $n$ and $ 3306^2 + 3834^2 $, I obtained the gcd to be 1. Which seems to me that $n$ could be prime? I understand that the Euclidean Algorithm does not imply this, but should I just  pick random numbers to try with $n$ until I find otherwise? What sort of process should I use here? For the final part of the question, I have tried to use Fermat's factorization method. By Fermat's factorization method, I know that $a >= \sqrt{n}$, so I have simply started from $ 3397^2 - n $ to try and find a perfect square.

458714,Far-field Poynting vector for time varying source [check my math please],"This is a question from classical electrodynamics, but it's the maths of it I need some help in. I have fields $\rho\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$, $\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ and $\vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The fields $\rho$ and $\vec{J}$ are related by the Continuity Equation :
$$
-\dfrac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}, t)} {\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \vec{J} (\vec{r}, t)
$$
Let us say $\mathbb{V}_s \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is the smallest spherical volume such that:
$$
\forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\notin \mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0
$$
$$
\forall t, \qquad \forall \vec{r}\in \partial\mathbb{V}_s: \qquad\qquad \rho\left(\vec{r},t\right) = \vec{J}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 0 
$$
Since $\mathbb{V}_s$ is a sphere, I say that its center is at $\vec{r}_0$, and its diameter id $\mathcal{D}$. Now given the definitions:
$$
\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s,\qquad
\vec{R} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_s,\qquad
R=\left|\vec{R}\right|, \qquad
\hat{R}=\frac {\vec{R}} {R}, \qquad
t_r = t - \frac {R} {c}
$$
The fields $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are as follows:
$$
\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[
\frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R} +
\frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \hat{R} -
\frac {1} {R c^2} \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \right]}
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)

$$
\vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi}
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[
\frac {\vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \times \hat{R} +
\frac {1} {R c} \frac {\partial \vec{J}  (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right]}
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)
$$
(Physically, $\vec{E}$, $\vec{B}$. $\vec{J}$ & $\rho$ have the standard meanings from Electrodynamics. The equations above are the Jefimenko's equations ) Now the paper ""The Relation Between Expressions for Time-Dependent Electromagnetic Fields Given by Jefimenko and by Panofsky and Phillips"" by Kirk T. McDonald shows that the expression for $\vec{E}$ can be transformed into:
$$
\scriptsize{
\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} {\left[
\frac {\rho (\vec{r}_s, t_r)} {R^2} \hat{R}
 + \frac 
      { \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \cdot \hat{R}\right)\hat{R} + \left(\vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) \times\hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R} } 
      {R^2 c}
 + \frac {1} {R c^2} \left( \frac {\partial \vec{J} (\vec{r}_s, t_r) } {\partial t} \times \hat{R} \right) \times \hat{R}
\right]}
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)
}
$$
Now I want to compute the quantity $\vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 
\dfrac {\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\mu_0}$ for $\vec{r}$ for which $R \gg \mathcal{D}$. I figured that for such values of $\vec{r}$, the maximum possible difference between the values of $\dfrac 1 R$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$ is:
$$\frac{1}{R} - \frac{1}{R+\mathcal{D}} = \frac{\mathcal{D}}{R\left(R+\mathcal{D}\right)} = \frac{1}{R}\cfrac{ \color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}{1+\color{red}{\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}}$$
Similarly, the maximum possible angle between the values of $\hat{R}$ for any two points $\vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s$  is:
$$
2\;{\tan}^{-1}\left(\frac12 \color{red} {\frac{\mathcal{D}}{R}}\right)
$$
When $R \gg \mathcal{D}$, $\dfrac {\mathcal{D}} R \approx 0$, and each of the two expressions above are $\approx 0$ as well. So $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ are essentially independent of $\vec{r}_s$. We can, therefore, bring out all $\dfrac 1 R$ and $\hat{R}$ factors outside the integral sign. So if I define the following:
$$
W\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} 
\rho \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right)
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)
$$
$$
\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} 
\vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right)
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right)
$$
$$
\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) = 
\iiint_{\mathbb{V}_s} 
 \frac {\partial \vec{J} \left( \vec{r}_s, t_r \right) } {\partial t}
\space dV\left(\vec{r}_s\right) 
= \frac {\partial \vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right)} {\partial t}
$$
I can then say:
$$
\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0}
\left[
   \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2} \hat{R}
    + \frac {\vec{Y} (\vec{r}, t) \cdot \hat{R}} {R^2 c} \hat{R}
    + \frac {\left(\vec{Y}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R^2 c}
    + \frac {\left(\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}\right) \times \hat{R}} {R c^2}  
\right]
$$
$$
\vec{B}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {\mu_0} {4 \pi}
\left[
    \frac {\vec{Y}  (\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R^2}
    + \frac {\vec{Z}(\vec{r}, t) \times \hat{R}} {R c} 
\right]
$$
Applying $\color{blue}{\left(\vec{a} \times \hat{u}\right) \times \hat{u} \equiv \left(\vec{a}\cdot\hat{u}\right)\hat{u} - \vec{a}}$, we can then say:
$$
\vec{E}\left(\vec{r},t\right) =
\frac {1} {4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[
 \left(
    \frac {W (\vec{r}, t)} {R^2}
    + 2\frac

Now my first question is: Is my math correct so far? Now, I define a sphere $\mathbb{V}$ with its center at $\vec{r}_0$ (the center of the source volume $\mathbb{V}_s$.) such that point $\vec{r}$ is on its surface. Then the unit vector $\hat{R}$ will actually be the unit normal $\hat{n}\left(\vec{r}\right)$ at $\vec{r}$. I want to compute the power passing the surface of $\mathbb{V}$, which should be:
$$
\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}}
  \vec{S}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \cdot \hat{R}
\;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)
= \frac 1 {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c} \oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left| \frac {\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {R} + \frac {\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}} {c} \right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right) 
$$ My second question is: How do I parameterize and compute this surface integral? I have got to the following expression (it seems to me that when I am integrating over $\vec{r}$, I can still take $\dfrac 1 R$ out from under the integral, but not $\hat{R}$), but I'm stuck after this: $$ \color{blue}{\dfrac {\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left|\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)} {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^4 c} + \dfrac {\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left(\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right)\cdot\left(\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right) \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)} {8 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^3 c^2}} \color{red}{+ \dfrac {\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left|\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)} {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^2 c^3}} $$ I expected to prove that the term in $\color{red}{red}$ is independent of $R$, and the term in $\color{blue}{blue}$ is 'reversible', by which I mean if there are two time instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that: $$\forall \vec{r}_s \in \mathbb{V}_s:\qquad \rho\left(t_1\right) = \rho\left(t_2\right), \qquad\vec{J}\left(t_1\right) = \vec{J}\left(t_2\right)$$ ... then I hoped to prove that: $$ \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \dfrac {\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left|\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right|^2 \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)} {16 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^4 c} + \dfrac {\oint_{\partial\mathbb{V}} \left(\vec{Y}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right)\cdot\left(\vec{Z}\left(\vec{r},t\right) \times \hat{R}\right) \;ds\left(\vec{r}\right)} {8 \pi^2 \epsilon_0 R^3 c^2}\;dt = 0$$ ... but so far I have not been able to make any progress.

458740,Nested Radical of Ramanujan,"I think I have sort of a proof of the following nested radical expression due to Ramanujan for $x\ge 0$. $$\large x+1=\sqrt{1+x\sqrt{1+(x+1)\sqrt{1+(x+2)\sqrt{1+\cdots}}}}$$ for $ x\ge -1$ I just want to know if my proof is okay or there is a flaw, and if there is one I request to give some suggestions to eliminate them. Thank you. The proof is the following: Proof: Let us define $$ a_n(x)=\underbrace{\sqrt{1+x\sqrt{1+(x+1)\sqrt{1+(x+2)\sqrt{1+\cdots}}}}}_{n \ \mbox{terms}}$$ for $x\ge 0$ so that $$ a_1(x)=\sqrt{1+x},\ a_2(x)=\sqrt{1+x\sqrt{1+(x+1)}},\ a_3(x)=\cdots$$ and so on. Since $x\ge 0$ each one of the $a_n$ is defined (I am taking only the positive square root). Also, we note that $$a_{n+1}^2(x)=1+xa_{n}(x+1)$$ Now, we note that $\{a_n(x)\}$ is an increasing sequence and that $$a_n(x)<x+1$$ $\forall n\ge 1$, this is easy to prove by induction as below: For $n=1$, $a_1(x)=\sqrt{1+x}<1+x$ since $x\ge 0\Rightarrow 1+x\ge 1$. SO it is true for $n=1$. Similarly, the truth can be proved for $n>1$. Then $a_n(x)$ converges to $$l(x)=\sup_{n}a_n(x)\le x+1$$ Now I make the following claim: Claim: $l(x)=x+1\quad \forall i\ge 0$ Proof: Fix $x$. Let $l(x)<x+1$. Then, $l(x)=x+1-\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$. Now, I claim that there must be a $n$ such that $$x+1-a_n(x)<\epsilon$$, and if that is true then $$a_n(x)>x+1-\epsilon=l(x)$$ which is a contradiction since $$l(x)=\sup_{n}a_n(x)$$ and then it implies that $$l(x)=x+1$$ To prove my claim it requires $$x+1-a_n(x) <  \epsilon$$ Now, \begin{align}
x+1-a_n(x) = & x+1-\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} \\
\ =& \frac{(x+1)^2-({1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)})}{x+1+\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} } \\
\ =& x\frac{(x+1)+1-a_{n-1}(x+1)}{x+1+\sqrt{1+xa_{n-1}(x+1)} } \\
\ <& \frac{x}{x+2}((x+1)+1-a_{n-1}(x+1))\\
\ <& \frac{x}{x+2}\cdot\frac{x+1}{x+3}((x+2)+1-a_{n-2}(x+2))\\
\ <& \frac{x}{x+n-1}\cdot \frac{x+1}{x+n} ((x+n-1)+1-a_{1}(x+n-1))\\
\ <& \frac{x}{x+n-1}\cdot \frac{x+1}{x+n}(x+n-\sqrt{x+n})\\
\ <& \frac{x(x+1)}{x+n-1}
\end{align} Now, if one is able to find $n$ such that $$\frac{x(x+1)}{x+n-1}<\epsilon
\Rightarrow x< \frac{-(1-\epsilon)+\sqrt{(1-\epsilon)^2+4\epsilon(n-1)}}{2}$$ then we're done. Now from the upper bound it seems that there always exists some $n$ that satisfies this requirement. Hence the claim is proved.","['nested-radicals', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification']"
458767,Are filters in lattices exactly the homomorphic preimages $\varphi^{-1}(1)$ of top elements?,"Say I got a lattice $L$, a bounded lattice $K$ with top-element $1$ and a homomorphism $\varphi : L \to K$, then $\varphi^{-1}(1)$ is a filter in L.

This should be some kind of contraction of $F$ into a new, single element. My idea would be to define an equivalence relation on $L$ $$a \sim b :\Leftrightarrow a = b \text{ or } a, b \in F$$ and show that it's in fact a congruence.

458771,"Area of supercircles, or how to integrate $\int_0^1 \sqrt[n]{1-x^n}dx$?","Martin Gardner, somewhere in the book Mathematical Carnival ; talks about superellipses and their application in city designs and other areas. Superellipses (thanks for the link anorton) are defined by the points lying on the set of curves: $$\left|\frac{x}{a} \right|^n + \left|\frac{y}{b} \right|^n = 1$$ After reading the chapter, I was wondering how to calculate the area of these shapes. So I started by the more simplistic version of supercircles' area: $$\frac{A}{4}=\int_0^1 \sqrt[n]{1-x^n}dx$$ Although, it looks simple, but I wasn't able to evaluate the integral(except some simple cases, i.e. $n=1,2,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\cdots$). So I asked Mathematica to see if its result can shed some light on the integration procedure, the result was: $$\int_0^1\sqrt[n]{1-x^n}dx=\frac{\Gamma \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^2}{\Gamma \left(\frac{n+2}{n}\right)}$$
where $\Re(n)>0$. But I still couldn't figure out the integration steps. So my question is: how should we do this integration? SideNotes: It's easy to evaluate the integral in the limit of $n \rightarrow \infty$! One way to do it is using Taylor series expansion, and keeping the relevant terms(only first term in this case). Some beautiful supercircles are shown in the image bellow: As one can see their limiting case is a square. Also, it will be really nice, if one can calculate the volume of the natural generalization of the curve to 3(or $k$) dimensions: $$\left|\frac{x}{a} \right|^n + \left|\frac{y}{b} \right|^n +\left|\frac{z}{c} \right|^n = 1$$","['definite-integrals', 'volume', 'integration', 'surfaces']"
458780,Probability that a random edge coloring of the complete graph is proper,"Suppose we color the edges $\{1,\ldots, {n \choose 2}\}$ of the complete graph on $n$ vertices with $m$ colors each edge being assigned a color picked uniformly at random from $\{1,\ldots, m\}.$ I would like to estimate the probability that the obtained random coloring is proper, that is all edges incident with a vertex $v$ are colored with different colors. One way to do this is as follows. Suppose $E_i$ is the event that the edge $e_i$ of $K_n$ is colored with a color that already occurs at its adjacent edges. Then $$Pr[E_i] = \frac{1}{m} (1 - (1-\frac{1}{m})^{2n-4})$$ and thus the probability that $G$ is not colored properly is estimated as $$Pr[E_1\cup \ldots E_{n \choose 2}] \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2m}  (1 - (1-\frac{1}{m})^{2n-4} )$$ Now this is not a good estimate since the right hand size is larger then one for any $m$ that is not ""large enough"". Another way to estimate this is to define the event $V_i$ to be that the $i$th vertex of our graph is incident with edges of distinct colors and use a similar estimate. But again the given bound is not very sharp. Hence I am wondering is there a more delicate way to estimate the mentioned probability? Is this known? Is there a different way to model this ?","['graph-theory', 'coloring', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

Recall, we define the indefinite integral of $f$ by $$\lambda(E)=\int_{E} f \, d\mu$$ for $E \in \textbf{X}$. Let $f_1$ and $f_2$ be in $L$ and let $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ be their indefinite integrals. Show that $\lambda_1 (E) = \lambda_2 (E)$ for all $E \in \textbf{X}$ if and only if $f_1(x)=f_2(x)$ for almost all $x \in X$. Similar to my last question, I am having trouble with one direction of the proof. I am assuming $\lambda_1 (E) = \lambda_2 (E)$ for all $E \in \textbf{X}$. My idea is to show that the set $F= \{x \in X: f_1(x)\neq f_2(x)\}$ has measure $0$. The rational numbers are countable; hence, they can be indexed by the natural numbers. Let $(r_n)$ be the sequence of rational numbers. Set $$ F_n = (\{x \in X: f_1(x)>r_n\} \cap \{x \in X: f_2(x)<r_n\}) \cup (\{x \in X: f_1(x)<r_n\} \cap \{x \in X: f_2(x)>r_n\})$$ for each $n$. Then, $\bigcup F_n = F$. But, I am not too sure how to show that $\mu(F_n)=0$ for each $n$. Or, perhaps, there is a much easier way. Based on this and my previous question, it appears I am lacking in techniques of how to show sets have measure $0$. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",['measure-theory']

Given a sequence of element $h_n$ indexed by $\mathbb N$, we say their sum converges in norm if the sequence $\{\sum_{n=1}^k h_n \}$ converges in norm. This is the usual notion of a convergent sum in a Hilbert space. However, there is also the concept of convergence as a net, which applies also to uncountable sums. Given some index set $I$ and elements $h_i$, $i\in I$, we let $\mathcal F$ be the collection of all finite subsets of $I$, ordered by inclusion. This makes $\mathcal F$ into a directed. set. For each $F\in \mathcal F$, we define $$h_F = \sum\{ h_i : i\in F\}.$$ This is a finite sum, so it is an element of $\mathcal H$. The set of sums $h_F$ forms a net in $\mathcal H$. We say the sum over $I$ of the $h_i$ converges if the net converges. ( See here for more information on nets. ) Given a set of elements of $\mathcal H$ indexed by $\mathbb N$, one naturally wonders about how net convergence and norm convergence relate. I would like to prove the following. If $\{ h_n\}$ is a sequence in Hilbert space and $\sum\{ h_n: n\in

459134,"If $u$ is harmonic and bounded in $0 < |z| < \rho$, show that the origin is a removable singularity","This is a reworking of a previous question here which was marked as a duplicate. Some nice folks have referred me to solutions to similar problems. I still have a couple of questions, since one of the solutions used the Poisson kernel, which is not the desired solution in the text, because the Poisson kernel has not been introduced yet. The other solutions were for problems that were similar, but whose solutions were only partially applicable, as I understand them. I'm working on a problem from p. 166 of Lars Ahlfors' Complex Analysis : If $u$ is harmonic and bounded in $0 < |z| < \rho$, show that the origin is a removable singularity in the sense that $u$ becomes harmonic in $|z|<\rho$ when $u(0)$ is properly defined. My Solution So Far: Here's what I've got for a non-Poisson kernel solution: We want to find a harmonic conjugate for $u$ in the punctured disk, and then we can apply big Picard to show that $0$ is a removable singularity. The problem is that the punctured disc is not simply connected. If we take $\sigma = (u \circ \exp)(z): L \to \mathbb{C}$, where $L$ is the left half-plane, now we have $\sigma$ harmonic, and defined in a simply connected set $L$, so it has a harmonic conjugate $\tau$. Now we wish to take $v = (\tau \circ \log):\{0 < |z| < \rho\}\to \mathbb{C}$, but in order to do so we need $\tau$ to be $2\pi i$-periodic. This is where my proof breaks down. One of the similar problems which readers referred me to used the following strategy: note that since $\sigma$ is $2\pi i$-periodic, and $\sigma, \tau$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we have that $\nabla\tau(z) = \nabla\tau(z + 2 \pi i)$ for all $z\in L$, or in other words, $\tau(z) - \tau(z+2\pi i)$ is a constant function, say, equal to $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, the solution suggests, we can set $$g(z) = u + iv - \frac{c}{2\pi}z,$$ in order to make $g$ $2\pi i$-periodic, and then we can use $(g\circ \log)$ on $\{0 < |z| < \rho\}$. But the reason why this won't work for my purposes is: now we have changed $u$! On the other hand, we can't simply subtract $\frac{c}{2\pi}\Im{(z)}$, and try to leave $u$ untouched, because now $g$ is not analytic. How can we get around this? Another strategy entirely might be to try to use the mean-value property. Ahlfors discusses that a lot in the preceding section, and his main example is the punctured disc. Since $u$ is harmonic, we know that the average over circles centered at zero is a constant...","['harmonic-functions', 'complex-analysis']"

First, by translating each coordinate by $k/q$ where $0\leq k\leq q-1$, one sees that $q^n$ disjoint translates of $(0,1/q)^n$ are contained in $[0,1]^n$. But normalization, monotonicity, and translation invariance, it follows that

q^n m((0,1/q)^n)\leq 1$$

459230,Computing Brauer characters of a finite group,"I am studying character theory from the book ""Character Theory of Finite Groups"" by Martin Isaac. (I am not too familiar with valuations and algebraic number theory.)
In the last chapter on modular representation theory, Brauer characters, blocks, and defect groups are introduced. My question is this: How do we find the irreducible Brauer characters and blocks, given a group and a prime? For instance, let's say we have $p=3$ and the group $G = S_5$, the symmetric group.
An example of the precise calculation or method used to determine the characters would be very helpful. Thanks.","['representation-theory', 'characters', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory']"
459236,Constructing the character table of a group,"I am aware that, given a group, there is no simple general procedure to construct the character table of the group (over complex numbers). However, for specific groups, we could use helpful additional information regarding the characters, (apart from orthogonality relations, etc.) to construct the character table. For instance, we know that the characters of a symmetric group are all integers. Now suppose we have the group $S_5$, the symmetric group on 5 elements. Suppose we are given only the degrees of the irreducible representations/characters, namely $1,1,4,4,5,5,6$.
Can this alone (apart from general results on characters) be used to derive the entire character table of $S_5$?","['representation-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'characters', 'symmetric-groups', 'group-theory']"

I want to explain that like this: if $0$ is not in $f(X)$, then $X$ may be considered as the support of $f$, but the support of $f$ is compact since $f\in C_c(X)$, hence it contradicts to the hypothesis of $X$, thus $0\in f(X)$.
