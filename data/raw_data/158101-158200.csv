2709016,"Tricky inequality concerning polynomials on $[0,1]^n$","I have been trying to prove the following inequality. Let $[n] = \{1, \dots, n\}$, and let $\mathcal{S} = \{S \subseteq [n] : |S| = n-1\}$. Then, for all $0 \leq x_1, \dots, x_n \leq 1$:
$$\sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \prod_{j \in S} x_j \leq 1 + n\prod_{j \in [n]} x_j$$
For example, when we set $n = 2$, we obtain the following inequality:
$$x_1 + x_2 \leq 1 + 2x_1x_2 \qquad (0 \leq x_1,x_2 \leq 1)$$
And for $n = 3$, the inequality becomes:
$$x_1x_2 + x_1x_3 + x_2x_3 \leq 1 + 3x_1x_2x_3 \qquad (0 \leq x_1,x_2,x_3 \leq 1)$$
Any hints on how to prove these inequalities for general $n \in \mathbb{N}$ would be greatly appreciated. Note: Equality only occurs when all variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$ equal $1$, except for one, which equals $0$. So, for $n = 2$, equality occurs for $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, and for $n = 3$, we obtain equality when we take $(0,1,1)$, $(1,0,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$. Hence, intuitively, points in the vicinity of these points can be considered hard . My own attempts: Note that the case $n = 2$ can be elegantly proven. For any $0 \leq x_1, x_2 \leq 1$ we have $-1 \leq 1 - 2x_1 \leq 1$ and $-1 \leq 1 - 2x_2 \leq 1$ and hence:
\begin{align*}
(1 - 2x_1)(1 - 2x_2) &\geq -1 & \Leftrightarrow \\
1 - 2(x_1 + x_2) + 4x_1x_2 &\geq -1 & \Leftrightarrow \\
-2(x_1 + x_2) &\geq -2 - 4x_1x_2 & \Leftrightarrow \\
x_1 + x_2 &\leq 1 + 2x_1x_2
\end{align*}
However, I do not see a way to generalize this proof.","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality', 'polynomials']"
2709042,Can I perform 1D integration by substitution in multiple integrals?,"Suppose I have an integral of the form: $$\idotsint_D f({\bf{x}})dA = \int_{a_n}^{b_n}\ldots\int_{a_1}^{b_1}f({\bf{x}})dx_1\ldots dx_n$$ Can I perform a single variable calculus style integration by substition? If I fix all other variables in $f({\bf{x}})$ and consider $g(x_1) = f(x_1, c_2 \ldots, c_n)$, then I can make the substitution $u = h(x_1)$ and write $dx = \frac{1}{h'(x_1)}du$ to conclude: $$\int_{a_1}^{b_1}g(x_1)dx_1 = \int_{h(a_1)}^{h(b_1)}\hat{g}(u)du$$ Assuming the substitution is well chosen s.t. $g(x_1, u)\frac{1}{h'(x_1)} = \hat{g}(u)$ and the problem is more tractable. But if I try to carry this logic over to an iterated integral then I am transforming several variables, even if they are constant in this integral. Can I naively put these in the limits? I am not sure if I should start drawing pictures in the new system of coordinates to determine the limits I defined and if I should calculate Jacobians, or if I should just apply the formula from the 1 variable case. If it helps, the integral that confused me was: $$\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{2}\frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^3}dydx$$ With the substition $u = x^2 + y^2$. I'm not sure how I would even calculate a Jacobian for this, without trying to horribly force square roots to write $x$ as a $x(u)$?, for that I need enough relations for a $2\times2$ matrix of partial derivatives, this is just one.","['multivariable-calculus', 'definite-integrals', 'coordinate-systems']"

2709153,Rectangle dissection into similar rectangles,"Here is a rectangle divided into rectangles similar to itself: The small horizontal rectangle has dimensions $1.20613\times1$ . That first value is the square root of the largest root of $-1 - 5 x + x^2 + 2 x^3 = 0$ . The discriminant of that polynomial is 1101. All the various roots used in the other rectangles can be equated to this discriminant either directly or through squaring the root. We will say that this rectangle has discriminant 1101. A few rules that this rectangle follows: 1. At least one rectangle has an edge of length 1. 2. If two rectangles are congruent, they have different orientations. 3. The outer rectangle is similar to the component rectangles. 4. All component rectangles are similar. 5. The outer rectangle is divided into more than 1 component rectangles. Here's a similar rectangle dissection with discriminant 5, corresponding to the golden ratio. If a discriminant cannot be reached with fewer rectangles, the dissection is minimal. If Rule 3 is relaxed, a square can be divided into rectangles with discriminant -23, which indicates the plastic constant . I'm particularly looking for solutions (without relaxation of rule3) giving the Pisot numbers , which have discriminants -23 (plastic constant), -31 (Narayana Cow constant), -283 ( $-1 - x^3 + x^4 = 0$ ), 1609 ( $-1 + x^2 - x^3 - x^4 + x^5=0$ ), 3857 ( $-1 - x - x^2 - x^3 + x^5=0$ ), 4477 ( $-1 - x^2 - x^4 + x^5=0$ ), 29077 ( $-1 + x - x^2 + x^4 - 2 x^5 + x^6=0$ ) and 37253 ( $-1 + x^2 - x^4 - x^5 + x^6=0$ ) Other solutions I'd like to see are those where all component rectangles appear twice in different orientations and those where the ratio of component sizes is a simple series, and all possible discriminants for 6 and fewer component rectangles. Here's one where I did not use an edge of length 1 because I wanted to show rectangle areas. If the 40 was 36 instead, we would have squares of 1 to 7 as areas of similar rectangles. But not quite.

2709208,Discontinuous function which is continuous when restricted to any algebraic curve,"Background : In a first course on multivariable calculus, it's really common to find examples of functions which are discontinuous, but continuous when restricted to any line, in order to build intuition for multivariable derivatives and limits. An example of such a function is the following: $$\begin{cases} 
      \frac{xy}{x^2+y^2} & x,y\neq 0 \\
      0 & x,y=0
   \end{cases}$$ This function is continuous when restricted to any line, 
and by reparameterizing $y\mapsto y^k$, we find examples of functions which are discontinuous but continuous when restricted to higher-order algebraic curves. Question : Is there an example of a function which is discontinuous but continuous when restricted to any algebraic curve (specifically, the vanishing locus of some polynomial)? Inspiration : I recently tutored some students through some examples of the type mentioned above, and this popped up as a natural question to ask where I was unsure about what the answer was. Work/thoughts : I've tried replacing $y$ with $e^y$ or $e^y-1$, but it appears that this doesn't even handle the case of lines.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Prove that there is $C$ such that $B=CA$. If $A$ is invertible, we can get $C=BA^{-1}$. Now let's say that $A$ is not invertible so $\det A=0$. This means that the system of linear equations $Ax=0$ has a nonzero solution. But this means that also $Bx=0$ has a nonzero solution so $\det B=0$. Let $v \neq 0$ such that $Av=Bv=0$. Then $(A+B)v=(A-B)v=0$ which gives $\det(A+B)=\det(A-B)=0$. Using $$\det(A+\lambda B)=\det A +p\lambda +q \lambda^2+(\det B)\cdot \lambda^3=p\lambda+q\lambda^2$$

EDIT: The ODE looks like this: $\vec{P}_{n+1}^i = \vec{P}_n^i + \Delta t [ \sum_{j \not = i} K (\vec{P}_{n}^j - \vec{P}_n^i) + \sum_{j \not = i} \frac{G(\vec{P}_{n}^i - \vec{P}_n^j)}{|\vec{P}_{n}^j - \vec{P}_n^i|^2}]$ For a bunch of particles (each being $i$) in two dimensions (so each position $\vec{P} = [x, y]^T$).

What value of $x$ would minimize $\sum m_i |x-x_i|^k$, for values of $k>2$?  (If we normalize $\sum m_i=1$, then an equivalent interpretation is a real-valued random variable $X$ taking value $x_i$ with probability $m_i$.)

(B) For $k \rightarrow \infty$, the optimal $x$ is the point that minimizes the maximum individual ""deviation"" $d_i = |x-x_i|$, so the optimum is halfway between the leftmost and rightmost points, i.e. $x^* = (\min_i x_i + \max_i x_i)/2$ (C) For any $k\ge2$, if there are just two point masses, the optimal $x$ is the value satisfying: $m_1 d_1^{k-1} = m_2 d_2^{k-1}$, where $d_i = |x-x_i|$.  (Easy proof by differentiating $m_1 d_1^k + m_2 d_2^k$.) Any idea how to solve the general problem?

  basis, i.e., an orthonormal set whose linear span is dense in $H$ My attempt : Let $V = (v_n)_{n\geq1}$ be a dense countable set of vectors in $H$. Remove all  vectors that are $0$, and then, skim the sequence from the left to the right and remove every vector that is a linear combination of the previous ones. Call the obtained sequence, which is possibly finite, $(y_n)_{n\geq1}$. By construction, this sequence of vectors is linearly independent, so we can apply the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm to find a sequence $(\phi_n)_n$ of vectors such that $O := \{\phi_n\mid n\}$ is an orthonormal set of vectors. It now suffices to show that the linear span of $O$ is dense in $H$, in order to conclude that $O$ is an orthonormal basis. For this, it suffices to show that $O^\perp = \{0\}$. So, let $v \in O^\perp$. Then $\langle v,\phi\rangle = 0$ for every $\phi \in O$, and by linearity of the inner product, it follows that $v \in \operatorname{span}(O)^\perp$.

Here's how my book derives the formula for the volume of the sphere: A sphere can be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by
  revolving a semicircle about its diameter (see the figure below). If
  the equation of the semi-circle is $x^2+y^2=a^2$, then the element of
  volume is $dV=\pi y^2dx=\pi(a^2-x^2)dx$ and the volume of the sphere
  is given by  $$V=2\int_0^a{\pi(a^2-x^2)dx}=\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3$$ So I thought: well, I know that the 'lateral' surface area of the element of volume $dV$ is just the circumference times a little change in $x$, so by the same reasoning the area of the sphere should be given by $$2\int_0^a{2\pi\sqrt{a^2-x^2}dx}$$ That way we should be able to cover the whole surface of the sphere.

We can show this is stationary by proving that $\boldsymbol{\pi }=\boldsymbol{\pi }\boldsymbol{P}$. $$(\pi P)_{v}=\sum_{w}\pi _{w}P_{wv}= \sum_{w\sim v}\frac{deg(w)}{2e}\frac{1}{deg(w)}=\frac{1}{2e}\sum_{w\sim v}1=\frac{deg(v)}{2e}=\pi _{v}.$$ To make use of this, we can look at the hypercube. The $n$-hypercube graph has $2^{n}$ vertices.  The sum of the degrees of the vertices is $n2^{n}$.  So, $$\pi _{v}=\frac{n}{n2^{n}}=\frac{1}{2^{n}}.$$ The distribution is uniform.

Someone told me that you can use: $$
\cos(A)+(\cos(B)+\cos(C))+(\cos(A)+\cos(B))+\cos(C)+\cos(B)+(\cos(A)+\cos(C))

I'm interested in showing that the Clifford action is skew-adjoint with respect to the hermitian inner product. As far as I understood the bundle of spinors is build in the following way. Let $\rho\colon \text{Spin}(n)\to M_{2^n}(\Bbb C)$ be the representation of the Clifford algebra as a matrix algebra (the authors claim it's an isomorphism), with a little abuse of notation we will use $\rho$ to denote the representation of $\text{Spin}(n)\subset \Bbb C L_n$, given by the restriction of the above isomorphism. Therefore the spinor bundle $S$ is $$ S = P_{\text{Spin}(n)} \times_{\rho} \Bbb C^{2^n} \to X$$
We have an action of $\Bbb C l (TX)$ on the second summand which respect the identifications, hence we have an action of the Clifford algebra on $S$. I need to prove that such an action is skew symmetric when restricted to unitary elements $v \in T_x(X)\subset \Bbb C l (TX)$. Skew-symmetry involves the fact that when restrict to a fiber of $S$ with the canonical hermitian product defined (please correct me if I'm wrong) as
$$ \langle (\alpha,s_1),(\beta,s_2)\rangle := \langle \rho(\alpha)s_1,\rho(\beta)s_2\rangle$$ where the latter is the canonical hermitian product on $\Bbb C^{2^n}$, we have $$\langle v\cdot s_1,s_2\rangle =  -\langle  s_1,v\cdot s_2\rangle $$ for $s_1,s_2$ in some fiber of $S$.

$\gamma(0,t)=\gamma(t)$ and $\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\right \vert _{s=0}

I tried two different approaches. 1) My first idea was that the exponential, a fast-oscillating function around $x=1$, is killed by the $(1-x)^K$, and the integral should be dominated by the vicinity of $x=0$. Therefore, I put $x=y/K$ and approximate $(1-y/K)^K\approx e^{-y}$ and $\frac{x}{1-x}\approx \frac{y}{K}$ to get $$f(K,a)\approx \frac{1}{K^3}\int_0^\infty e^{-y+iay}y^2dy=\frac{2}{K^3(1-ia)^3}.$$ 2) On the other hand, the stationary phase approximation should be valid. If I write 
$$f(K,a)=\int_0^1 e^{KS(x)}x^2dx,$$
with $S(x)=\log(1-x)+iax/(1-x)$, the equation $S'(x_0)=0$ gives $x_0=1-ia$. Second derivative is $S''(x_0)=-1/a^2$.

I wonder what kind of property $\Sigma_\infty$ can inherit from the sequence. More precisely, if $\Sigma_n$ is the graphical, is it possible to show that $\Sigma_\infty$ is graphical as well? Of course one needs to be careful. 
Indeed it is easy to construct a sequence of functions $f_n: \{(x, y, z) : z = 0\}  \to \mathbb R$ such that $\Sigma_n := \text{graph}(u)$ satisfies the above properties but $\Sigma_\infty$ is not the graph of a function from $\{(x, y, z) : z = 0\} $. But one might still hope to  prove that $\Sigma_\infty$ is graphical but w.r.t. another direction. The example I have in mind is the following. Consider the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$. Consider the following sequence of points on its graph:
$$
p_n \quad \colon =  \quad (n, 0, n^2).
$$
Consider now the sequence 
$$
\Sigma_n \quad \colon= \quad \text{graph}(f) - p_n.

Just a random thought came to my mind after writing this question. the first identity on the same page states that $(i) \ln(z_1 z_2 ) = \ln z_1 + \ln z_2$ . this and the third identity seem to be equivalent by substituting both $z_1$ and $z_2$ by $i$ .

Therefore, obviously $x! = \int_{0}^{1}(-\ln(t))^{x-1}dt$ (this can also be verified by graphing both functions).  This reminded me of something I thought about a long time ago: $f(x)=(x!)^{\frac{1}{x}}$.

So, is there a way to take the above derivative or any other variant of $x!$ (or $\Gamma(x-1)$)? [NO POINTERS GIVEN YET] Lastly, most importantly, and my primary reason for asking this question... My ultimate goal is finding $\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_0^1\left(-\ln\left(t\right)\right)^{x}dt\right)^{\frac{1}{x}}.$  If you have any pointers or small hints on anything I could look into, that would very much be appreciated.

\begin{equation}
||u||_{W^{k,p}(M^n,g)} \leq C_2?

If this is the case, then in particular we get uniform bounds on all the functions $u$, in which case just doing conformal transformations in the integrals (see the comments) answers in the affirmative.","['conformal-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'sobolev-spaces']"

2711304,Showing $(3 + \sqrt{3})$ is not a prime ideal in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]$,"Let $I = (3+\sqrt{3})$ Looking at the field norm we note that $N(3 + \sqrt{3}) = 6$. We also know that $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]$ is a Euclidean Domain. We want to find some $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]$ s.t. $\alpha \cdot \beta = 3 + \sqrt{3}$. This requires $N(\alpha)\cdot N(\beta) = 6$. So $N(\alpha) \in \{\pm 2\}$ and $N(\beta) \in \{\pm 3\}$. $N(a+b\sqrt{3}) = a^2 - 3b^2 = -2$ when $\alpha = 1 - \sqrt{3}$ which is a non-unit since $N(\alpha) \neq 1$. 
Then we have $N(c + d\sqrt{3}) = c^2 - 3d^2 = -3$ when $\beta = -3 - 2\sqrt{3}$ which is also a non-unit. Then we see $\alpha\cdot\beta=(1-\sqrt{3})(-3-2\sqrt{3}) = 3 + \sqrt{3}$ Since this is a non trivial factorization of $3+\sqrt{3}$, then we see that $(1-\sqrt{3})\cdot(-3-2\sqrt{3})\in I$. It remains to show that neither $\alpha$ or $\beta$ are in $I$. Taking $\frac{1-\sqrt{3}}{3+\sqrt{3}} = \frac{(1-\sqrt{3})(3-\sqrt{3})}{6} = \frac{(3-\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} +3)}{6} = \frac{-4\sqrt{3}}{6}$ which is not in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{3}]$. So there will be some remainder implying that $\alpha$ is not in $I$. Doing the same thing we calculate $\frac{-3-2\sqrt{3}}{3+\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-3-\sqrt(3)}{6}$. Again, it will yield a remainder so we conclude that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not in $I$, yet $\alpha \cdot \beta \in I$. Thus $(3+\sqrt{3})$ is not prime. Is this attempt correct? Is there a shorter way to go about this?","['abstract-algebra', 'euclidean-domain', 'proof-verification']"
