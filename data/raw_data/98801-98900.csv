1366182,How does the Vitali set violate the definition of measurable sets?,"In my textbook the Vitali set is shown as a classic example of non-measurable sets. The proof is done by showing that you can derive an impossible measure of this set if it is measurable. I also searched the internet and there are other proofs more or less the same. One proof can be found here ""Is outer measure a measure?"" . However, no material I read directly shows how the Vitali set (denoted as $V$) violates the definition of measurable sets, that is for any set $A$ the equation $|A|_e=|A\bigcap V|_e+|A\bigcap V^C|_e$ holds, where $|A|_e$ denotes outer measure. Since the Vitali set is non-measurable, there must exist some set $A$ that does not satisfy the equation. Can anyone help find an example of such an $A$?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
1366206,Condition for $\overline{M}$-measurable in problem 2.24 by Folland,"I'm self-learning Real Analysis using Real Analysis of Folland, and I got stuck on this problem. Let $(X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)$ be a measure space with $\mu(X) < \infty$, and let $(X, \overline{\mathcal{M}}, \overline{\mu})$ be its completion. Suppose $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is bounded. Prove that $f$ is $\overline{\mathcal{M}}$-measurable iff there exist sequences $\{\phi_n\}$ and $\{\omega_n\}$ of $\mathcal{M}$-measurable simple functions such that $\phi_n\ \le f \le \omega_n$ and $\int(\omega_n - \phi_n)d \mu < n^{-1}$. In this case, $\lim{\int \phi_n d\mu} = \lim{\int \omega_n d\mu} = \int{fd\overline{\mu}}$ I thought about those functions which uses in Rienmann integral, but this problem only relates to Lebesgue integral, so I don't think they can help.

1366246,Powerset of infinite set minus original set equivalent to the poweset,"I had this idea which I am fairly certain is true but I am not quite certain nor how to go about proving it.

1366301,Continued fraction estimation of error in Leibniz series for $\pi$.,"The following arctan formula for $\pi$ is quite well known
$$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots\tag{1}$$ and bears the name of Madhava-Gregory-Leibniz series after its discoverers. The formula has an easy proof via integration. While reading a paper by Ranjan Roy titled ""The Discovery of the Series Formula for $\pi$ by Leibniz, Gregory and Nilakantha"" I was surprised to find that error in approximation via $n$ terms of series $(1)$ can be expressed in terms of a continued fraction studied by both Rogers and Ramanujan . Let $$f(x) = \cfrac{1}{x +\cfrac{1^{2}}{x +\cfrac{2^{2}}{x +\cfrac{3^{2}}{x + \cdots}}}}\tag{2}$$ for $x > 0$ and let $n$ be a positive integer. Let us define $S_{n}$ by $$S_{n} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(-1)^{i - 1}\cdot\frac{1}{2i - 1}$$ so that $S_{n}$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ partial sum of series $(1)$. Then we have the formula $$\frac{\pi}{4} = S_{n} + (-1)^{n}\cdot\frac{f(2n)}{2}\tag{3}$$ The formula above is so marvelous that first 2-3 convergents of the continued fraction $(2)$ are sufficient to give a very good approximation of $\pi$ for small values of $n$. For example if $n = 4$ so that $$S_{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{2}{35} = \frac{76}{105}$$ and taking 3rd convergent of $f(8)$ we see that $$f(8) \approx \cfrac{1}{8 +\cfrac{1^{2}}{8 +\cfrac{2^{2}}{8}}} = \frac{17}{138}$$ and hence $$\frac{\pi}{4} = S_{4} + \frac{f(8)}{2} \approx \frac{76}{105} + \frac{17}{276} = 0.78540372670807$$ which is greater than $\pi/4$ by approximately $5.5 \times 10^{-6}$ so that the approximation is really great. I would like to know the proof of identity $(3)$. Any reference for the proof would also be helpful. Update : Sorry people! I found the answer myself when I used the information in related link about the continued fraction $f(x)$. See my answer below. On the other hand I would be more than happy if we can obtain a proof of $(3)$ without using Rogers proof mentioned in my answer. Perhaps there was some simpler proof available with Nilkantha.","['reference-request', 'calculus', 'pi', 'continued-fractions']"

1366393,Monopoly Game Statistics,"I was playing a game of monopoly the other day, and in the course of strategizing I came up with the idea that how 'safe' you were in the game was a matter of what your expected income/outcome was as you went around the board. I figured it would be a fun project to make a helper program that would compute these values based on a given board configuration, but I found that the statistics got too complicated for me. At first I was going to just sum up the amount of potential costs you could have on each tile (excluding Chance and Community Chest cards for simplicity), and dividing by 40, the number of tiles on the board, to get the expected value. But I realized that's not actually the expected value because you're not going to land on every tile, and you definitely won't land on 40 tiles in the course of traversing the board. At this point, I figure, there are several assumptions I could make - average die roll is 7, 40 tiles divided by seven steps is ~5.7 turns, so I could divide the total costs by that for an expected value, but that seems like an overly broad assumption in this case - there could be too much variance in the number of turns to get an accurate projection, I think. I was wondering if anybody more skilled with statistics could give me a hand with this - what is the expected value of your costs in traversing the monopoly board? I intended on ignoring chance and community chest and being sent to jail, as those seemed to overcomplicate the model, but if somebody can incorporate those effects I'd be interested in seeing them.","['probability', 'statistics']"

1366423,"Is there continuous $f: [0, 1] \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ such that for all $x$ there is $y$ with $f(y) < f(x)$?","I think there isn't. Here's a sketch of a proof. I'm just not sure whether it really works because I'm not confident with the transfinite versions of the standard theorems about limits and convergent sequences. Attempted proof: Suppose there were such a function. Then use transfinite recursion to generate the following transfinite sequence: BASE CASE: $s_0 = 1$. SUCCESSOR ORDINAL: Let $s_{\lambda + 1}$ be a number in $[0, 1]$ such that $f(s_{\lambda + 1}) < f(s_\lambda)$. LIMIT ORDINAL: Suppose $\lambda$ is a limit ordinal. Then the sequence $f(s_0)$, ..., $f(s_\alpha)$, ... with $\alpha < \lambda$ is bounded below by 0. So it has a limit $\lim_{\alpha < \lambda} f(s_\alpha$) (by a transfinite version of the Monotone Convergence Theorem). Also (by a transfinite version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem) there is a subsequence of $s_0$, ..., $s_\alpha$, ... that is unbounded in that sequence and it converges to a limit. Let's call that subsequence $s_{i_0}$, ..., $s_{i_\beta}, ...$ for $\beta < \gamma \leq \lambda$. Then let
$s := \lim_{\beta < \gamma} s_{i_\beta}$
Then, since $f$ is continuous,
$$
\lim_{\alpha < \lambda} f(s_\alpha) = \lim_{\beta < \gamma} f(s_{i_\beta}) = f(s)
$$
So let $s_\lambda = s = \lim_{\beta < \gamma} s_{i_\beta}$. Then there must be $\alpha$ such that $s_\alpha = s_{\alpha + 1}$, since there are at most continuum-many distinct numbers in the list $f(s_0)$, ..., $f(s_\alpha)$, ... . This gives a contradiction.","['continuity', 'convergence-divergence', 'real-analysis', 'transfinite-recursion']"

1366491,Magic 8 Ball Problem,"This problem is probably simple enough to have an analogous problem, I just don't know the name so I'm going to describe it and hopefully somebody can point me in the right direction. The problem is this: estimating the number of sides of a Magic 8 Ball . Let's say you perform the following process: Shake the ""Magic 8 Ball"" and mark down the result If the result has not previously been seen, add it to the set of possible results and label the trial ""N"" (for ""new"") If the result has been previously seen, label the trial ""O"" (for ""old"") Repeat all steps I imagine the following kind of sequence occurring: NNNNONNOONOONOOONOOOONONNOONOOONNOONOOOOOONOOONOOOOOOONOOOOOOOONOOOOOOOO... Now imagine we don't know there are twenty sides to a Magic 8 Ball. Or imagine that you have a Magic 8 Ball with 1000 sides. As the number of ""new"" trials approaches the actual number of sides, we'll get increasingly more ""old"" trials showing up in the mix. Once we've seen all of the possible results, we'll always get ""old"" results. But we're never 100% sure we've seen every single possible result. So here are the questions I'm interested in: As we proceed with trials, can we estimate the total number of ""sides"" of the Magic 8 ball based on the number of ""new"" and ""old"" trials up to this point?

1366543,Generalizing the pull-out property in conditional expectations,"Let $(\Omega, \mathscr{F}, P)$ be a probability space and $\mathscr{G}$ a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of $\mathscr{F}$. If $X$ and $Y$ are (integrable) random variables with $X$ being $\mathscr{G}$-measurable, the pull-out property $\mathbb{E}[XY \mid \mathscr{G}] = X \mathbb{E} [ Y \mid \mathscr{G} ]$ a.s. is well known. Written pointwise, the pull-out property reads as $\mathbb{E}[XY \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) = X(\omega) \mathbb{E}[Y \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega)$ for almost all $\omega$. Now assume that $X$ and $Y$ are random elements in some measurable spaces and $X$ is $\mathscr{G}$-measurable. It then follows that
$$\mathbb{E} [s(X)r(Y) \mid \mathscr{G} ](\omega) = s(X(\omega)) \mathbb{E} [ r(Y) \mid \mathscr{G} ](\omega) = \mathbb{E} [ s(X(\omega))r(Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega)$$
for almost all $\omega$ where $s$ and $r$ are measurable real-valued functions. Question: Let $f(x,y)$ be jointly measurable in $x$ and $y$. Is it then true that $$\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) = \mathbb{E}[f(X(\omega),Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) $$
for almost all $\omega$? The problem reduces to the question whether the indicator of a measurable set $B$ in the product space can be approximated by linear combinations of indicators over measurable sets of the form $B_1 \times B_2$ or equivalently, whether $f$ can be approximated by finite sums of products $s_k(x)r_k(y)$. I doubt that this property holds when considering for example $B$ as the diagonal (for $X$ and $Y$ real-valued and not independent). EDIT: I think to have found some problems in the statement. The most important problem is that the statement $\mathbb{E} [ f(X,Y) \mid \mathcal{G} ](\omega) = \mathbb{E} [ f(X(\omega), Y) \mid \mathcal{G} ](\omega)$ does not make any sense, since in the expression $f(X(\omega), Y)$ the $\omega$ is not fixed and we can only take conditional expectations over random variables! So, if we consider instead $f(X(\omega_0), Y)$ for some fixed $\omega_0$ then the statement changes to $\mathbb{E} [ f(X,Y) \mid \mathcal{G} ](\omega) = \mathbb{E} [ f(X(\omega_0), Y) \mid \mathcal{G} ](\omega)$ for almost all $\omega$ such that $X(\omega) = X(\omega_0)$, i.e. a.s. on $X^{-1}(\{ X(\omega_0) \} )$. But now another problem appears, since $\{ X(\omega_0) \}$ is in general not contained in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathscr{E}_X$. Summing up together: The statement makes sense, if $\mathscr{E}_X$ is atomic. And in this case, the statement is true.
The statement does not make sense, if $\mathscr{E}_X$ is not atomic. EDIT 2: After some discussions in the comments, it is now clear where the problem is hidden. The expression $\mathbb{E}[f(X(\omega),Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega)$ is to be interpreted as follows.
Firstly, for every $x$, define $Z_x(\omega) := \mathbb{E}[f(x,Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega)$ as some fixed(!) chosen version for the conditional expectation of $f(x,Y)$ given $\mathscr{G}$. Note that such a version $Z_x(\omega)$ is chosen for every $x$. Secondly, define $\mathbb{E}[f(X(\omega),Y) \mid \mathscr{G}](\omega) := Z_{X(\omega)}(\omega)$, i.e. by concatenation. First of all, one has to check whether this map $\omega \mapsto Z(X(\omega),\omega)$ is $\mathscr{G}$-measurable in order to satisfy one of the constraints for the conditional expectation. Assume that it is $\mathscr{G}$-measurable. But then, in general it is NOT a conditional expectation of $\mathbb{E}[f(X,Y) \mid \mathscr{G}]$. The example with $f(x,y) = xy$, $X = Y \sim U(0,1)$ and $\mathscr{G} := \sigma(X)$ in the comments shows that if we choose as versions $Z_x(\omega) := x X(\omega) \mathbf{1}_{X(\omega) \neq x}$ (which depend on $x$!) then the desired equation between the conditional expectations does not hold. So, this might be the reason, why I have not found this ""rule"" in mathematical literature on probability theory. However, note that
$\mathbb{E}[ f(X,Y) \mid \mathscr{G} ] = \mathbb{E}[ f(x,Y) \mid \mathscr{G}]$ a.s. on $\{ X = x \}$ (which is a direct consequence of the ""local property"" for conditional expectations). If $\mathscr{G} = \sigma(X)$ then this rule reads as
$\mathbb{E} [ f(X,Y) \mid X = x] = \mathbb{E} [ f(x,Y) \mid X = x ]$
and is often referred to as the ""replacement rule"". But, in order for this rule to be valid, it is necessary that the set $\{ X = x \}$ is measurable (which in general is not true, if $X$ takes values in a general measurable space $(E_X, \mathscr{E}_X)$.","['probability-theory', 'conditional-expectation']"
1366570,"Why, historically, do we multiply matrices as we do?","Multiplication of matrices — taking the dot product of the $i$th row of the first matrix and the $j$th column of the second to yield the $ij$th entry of the product — is not a very intuitive operation: if you were to ask someone how to mutliply two matrices, he probably would not think of that method.

I immediately thought that this was long-winded, but then I thought that it could be $\dfrac{1}{13} \times \dfrac{1}{13} \times \dfrac{1}{13} \times \dfrac{1}{13}$, although this in probably not correct.

1366755,Definition of Sobolev space $H^s$ and domain of $-\Delta^s$,"The spaces below are on $\partial\Omega$, the boundary of a bounded smooth domain $\Omega$. I read this in the book on page 141. Define $H^2 := \{ u \in L^2 \mid (-\Delta u) \in L^2\}$. And then: We can define $H^s$ ($s \in \mathbb{R}$) as the domain of $(-\Delta)^s$. If $\lambda_j, e_j$ are the eigenpairs of $-\Delta$, then
  $$H^s = \{ u \in (C_0^\infty)' \mid  \sum_j\lambda_j^{2s}|(u,e_j)_{L^2}|^2 < \infty \}$$ Now I'm confused, shouldn't the power of the eigenvalues be $s$, not $2s$? For example take $u \in H^1$. Then $u=\sum (u,e_j)e_j$, so $-\Delta u = \sum \lambda_j(u,e_j)e_j$ in the weak sense, so $\langle -\Delta u, u \rangle = \sum \lambda_j |(u,e_j)|^2 < \infty$.

1366756,Proof that a random measure with orthogonal increments is a measure,"Let me first state what I mean by a random measure with orthogonal increments. Definition: A random measure with orthogonal increments $Z$ is a collection $\left(Z(B): B \in \mathcal{B}_{(-\pi,\pi]}\right)$  of zero-mean, complex random variables $Z(B)$ indexed by the Borel sets $\mathcal{B}_{(-\pi,\pi]}$ defined on some probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{U},P)$ such that for some finite measure $\mu$ on $(-\pi,\pi]$
  $$\mathrm{cov}(Z(B_1),Z(B_2))=\mu(B_1\cap B_2) \quad \forall{B_1,B_2}\in \mathcal{B}_{(-\pi,\pi]}$$ Honestly, I don't think I understand this definition. If $Z$ is a measure then it must be true that $Z(\emptyset) = 0$. How does this follow from the definition above exactly? Do I take $B_1 = B_2 = \emptyset$ and argue that given $\mathrm{cov}(Z(B_1),Z(B_2))=\mu(B_1\cap B_2) = 0$ and $E[Z(B)] = 0$ for any $B \in \mathcal{B}_{(-\pi,\pi]}$, $Z(\emptyset) = 0$ $\ P$-almost surely? Next I would like to show that $Z(\cup_j B_j) = \sum_jZ(B_j)$ in mean square whenever $B_1,B_2,\ldots$ is a sequence of pairwise disjoint Borel sets. I am not sure what the mathematical formulation of this result is. My guess is
$$E[\lvert Z(\bigcup_j B_j) - \sum_jZ(B_j)\rvert^2] = 0$$
as this would imply  $Z(\cup_j B_j) = \sum_jZ(B_j)$ $\ P$-almost surely, which I think is the most you can expect from a random measure. (If it were an ordinary measure, we would insist on algebraic equality.) Assuming that my guess is right I proceed. From the definition I have (after a few steps)
$$\mathrm{var}\left(Z\left(\bigcup_j B_j\right)\right) = \mathrm{var}\left(\sum_jZ(B_j)\right) $$ I don't know how to continue from this point on. I would really appreciate some help. Thanks.","['spectral-theory', 'measure-theory']"

1366795,Strong Induction to prove $T(n)$ is $O(n)$ for $T(n) = T(\lfloor n/3 \rfloor) + T(\lfloor n/5 \rfloor) + T(\lfloor n/7 \rfloor) + n$,"I have some questions about Strong Induction where the inductive procedure isn't entirely clear to me. I will use a specific example to demonstrate and present my attempt at a proof with questions following. Suppose we have a recurrence relation $T(n)$ defined as follows
\begin{align*}
	T(0) &= 0 \\
	T(n) &= T\left(\left\lfloor n/3\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/5\right\rfloor\right) + T\left(\left\lfloor n/7\right\rfloor\right) + n, \enspace n > 0
\end{align*} Use Strong Induction to prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$. Proof: $\underline{\text{Base Case}}$: By definition of BigOh, we want to show that $\exists c > 0 \enspace \text{s.t.} \enspace T(n) \le cn, \enspace \forall n \ge n_0$. Since $T(0) = 0$, this holds for any choice of $c$ with $n=0$ and $n_0 = 0$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Hypothesis (I.H.)}}$: Suppose there exists such a $c$ for all $0 \le n < k$. $\underline{\text{Inductive Step}}$: We need to show that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$. Since $\lfloor k/3 \rfloor,\lfloor k/5 \rfloor,\lfloor k/7 \rfloor < k$, it follows by the I.H. that $T(\lfloor k/3 \rfloor) \le ck/3$, $T(\lfloor k/5 \rfloor) \le ck/5$, and $T(\lfloor k/7 \rfloor) \le ck/7$. Then using the definition of $T(n)$ we can say that
\begin{align*}
T(k) &\le \frac{ck}{3} + \frac{ck}{5} + \frac{ck}{7} + k\\
&\le ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right)
\end{align*}
To prove that $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n=k$, we need to show that this quantity is less than $ck$ as follows
\begin{align*}
ck\left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c}\right) &\le ck \\
\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\
\frac{71}{105} + \frac{1}{c} &\le 1 \\
\frac{1}{c} &\le \frac{34}{105} \\
c &\le \frac{105}{34}
\end{align*} So for any $c \ge 105/34$, $T(n) \in O(n)$ for $n = k$, and thus $T(n) \in O(n)$. Questions: What is the particular reason that strong induction is necessary for this proof? Is it because $T(n)$ is defined in terms of three previous recursive instances with floor functions that don't follow the same $+1$ ordering as the natural numbers? Or does it relate to proving asymptotic complexity where a claim $P(n)$ involves $\forall n \ge n_0$ for each $n$? Is my base case sufficient? Since BigOh typically applies to asymptotic limits, I have trouble understanding how to prove BigOh for a base case when $n$ takes on a specific value. Are there any issues with my attempted proof? Don't hold back, I would appreciate some formal criticism.","['asymptotics', 'algorithms', 'induction', 'discrete-mathematics']"

Is there an interpretation of this concept in terms of linear operators on vector spaces? As an example of what I am trying to ask , consider the operation of taking the transpose of a matrix (with entries from a field).
This can be thought of in terms of linear operators in the following way: Let $T:V\to V$ be a linear operator on a finite dimensional vector space $V$. We define the transpose of $T$ as the linear map $T^t:V^*\to V^*$ which sends a member $\omega\in V^*$ to the member $(v\mapsto \omega(Tv))$ of $V^*$.
Now if $\mathcal B$ is a basis of $V$ and $M$ is the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to the basis $\mathcal B$, then the matrix representation of $T^t$ with respect to the dual basis of $\mathcal B$ is same as the matrix transpose of $M$.","['linear-algebra', 'matrices']"

Since I couldn't find these results in Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry and I have no idea how to prove them, I hope someone can give me the details about these claims. Let $X$ be a Noetherian scheme. Claim 1 . If
$\mathcal{O}_X=\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}\oplus\mathcal{F_2^\bullet}$, we
assume that $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}$ and $\mathcal{F_2^\bullet}$ are
coherent sheaves, for their cohomology is concentrated in degree
zero (Maybe we can just assume $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}=\mathcal{F_1}$, $\mathcal{F_2^\bullet}=\mathcal{F_2}$). Then they are ideal sheaves of certain closed subschemes, say:
$X_j\subset X$, $\mathcal{F_j^\bullet}\simeq \mathcal{I}_{X_{j}}$
($j=1,2$). Claim 2 . $\mathcal{I}_{X_{1}}+\mathcal{I}_{X_{2}}\subset
   \mathcal{I}_{X_{1}\cap X_{2}} $ Claim 3 . $\mathcal{I}_{X_{1}\cup  X_{2}}\subset \mathcal{I}_{X_{1}}\cap \mathcal{I}_{X_{2}}$ and
$\mathcal{I}_{X_{1}}\cap \mathcal{I}_{X_{2}}=0$ For Claim 1, my thoughts as follows: Since $\mathcal{O}_X=\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}\oplus\mathcal{F_2^\bullet}$, we have an exact sequence $$0\longrightarrow \mathcal{F_1^\bullet} \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X/\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}=\mathcal{F_2^\bullet} \longrightarrow 0.$$ So, for any open subset of $U$ of $X$, $$0\longrightarrow \mathcal{F_1^\bullet}(U) \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(U) \longrightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(U)/\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}(U) \longrightarrow 0.$$ is an exact sequence of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$-modules. Hence $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}$ is a coherent sheaf of ideal on $X$. By Proposition II 5.9 on Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry (Page 116), $\mathcal{F_1^\bullet}$ is the ideal sheaf of a closed subscheme.

The condition (*) here is just saying that $X$ has a workable theory of Weil divisors, viz. (*) $X$ is a noetherian integral separated scheme which is regular in codimension one. Here's is Hartshorne's proof: The kernel of $\operatorname{Cl} X \to \operatorname{Cl} U$ consists of divisors whose support is contained in $Z$.  If $Z$ is irreducible, the kernel is just the subgroup of $\operatorname{Cl} X$ generated by $1 \cdot Z$. As written, this doesn't seem to make sense.  For instance, consider the case where $X = \mathbb{P}^2$, $Z = V(x_0) \subset \mathbb{P}^2$, and hence $U = X \setminus Z \cong \mathbb{A}^1$.  Then $\operatorname{Cl} U = 0$, so this says that every divisor in $\mathbb{P}^2$ is supported on $Z$.  But of course this is false, because there are higher degree curves. Of course, these higher-degree curves are linearly equivalent to divisors supported on $Z$, or the theorem would be false.  But I don't see how this has been proven.",['algebraic-geometry']

In particular, if $U = \operatorname{Spec} A$, one can check that $S(U)$ consists of the set of all nonzerodivisors of $A$. Since $S(U)$ is multiplicative, we define a presheaf of rings $U \mapsto S(U)^{-1}O_X(U)$ with the obvious restriction map and its sheafification $\mathscr{K}_X$, which is called the sheaf of total quotient rings of $X$. Let $A$ be any ring and denote by $K(A)$ its total quotient ring. I am suspecting that $\mathscr{K}_{X,p} = K(O_{X,p})$. Since sheafification preserves germs, it boils down to checking that
$$\mathscr{K}_{X,p} = \varinjlim_{p\in D(f)} K(A_f) \stackrel{?}{=} K(A_p).$$ My idea is the following: Since we have a system of compatible arrows $A\hookrightarrow K(A)$ and $A_f\hookrightarrow K(A_f)$, we have a natural map $A_p\to \mathscr{K}_{X,p}$. Since all nonzerodivisors of $A_p$ are invertible in the target, it factors to a morphism $\varphi: K(A_p)\to \mathscr{K}_{X,p}$. Conversely we have a system of compatible arrows $K(A)\to K(A_p)$ and $K(A_f)\to K(A_p)$, therefore it induces a morphism $\psi:\mathscr{K}_{X,p}\to K(A_p)$. And these two give the isomorphism.

Due to the convolution theorem we have:
$$FAf(x) = e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}Ff(x)$$ So $FAf(x)$ is a composition of the unitary Fourier transform $F$ and the multiplication operator $M$ by the function $e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$. Norm of the latter in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ equals to $\mathrm{ess\,sup}\left(e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}\right) = 1$. And the norm of $F$ is surely also $1$. That means that $\|A\| \leq 1$ The quastion is how one proves that $\|A\|=1$ (or is it so)? My guess of $\|A\|=1$ bases on the fact that if $f\equiv 1$, than $Af \equiv 1$. But we can't use it straightforward, since $f \equiv 1$ does not lie in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. Even if we consider sequance $f_n=\chi[-n,n]$ - indicators of $[-n,n]$, that doesn't do much. While finding such sequince $\{f_n\}$ that $\|Af_n\|/\|f_n\| \to 1$ is one way to prove the equility, I wonder if it somehow follows from the fact that $F$ is unitary operator and not just have unity norm. And so it somehow is evident that oparator $FAf(x) = e^{-x^2}Ff(x)$ has a unity norm and not just $\leq 1$.

so $\varphi^{-1}$ must exist and be smooth. The proof of Lemma 7.2 is left as an exercise to the reader, so I don't have much clue to understand what the author meant.","['smooth-manifolds', 'curvature', 'riemannian-geometry', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

1367557,$M= \{ A \in Mat_{2 \times 2}{\mathbb{R}}| \det(A)=1 \}$ is homeomorphic to $S^{1} \times \mathbb{R}^{2}$,"Let's consider a group $M$ (under multiplication) of all matrices $A$ of size $2 \times 2$ over $\mathbb{R}$ so that $\det(A)=1$.

1367590,Neukirch's motivation for $p$-adic numbers,"I've started reading Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory book and at the beginning of Chapter II he starts his motivation for the $p$-adic numbers as follows: ""The idea originated from the observation made in the last chapter that the numbers $f\in\mathbb{Z}$ may be viewed in analogy with the polynomials $f(z)\in\mathbb{C}[z]$ as functions on the space $X$ of prime numbers in $\mathbb{Z}$, associating to them their ""value"" at the point $p\in X$, i.e., the element $\begin{equation}
f(p):=f \mod p
\end{equation}$ in the residue class field $\kappa(p)=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.
This point of view suggests the further question: whether not only the ""value"" of the integer $f\in\mathbb{Z}$ at $p$, but also the higher derivatives of $f$ can be reasonably defined."" My question is: If we define the higher derivatives of $f\in\mathbb{Z}$ at $p$ as the coefficientes of its $p$-adic expansion (as he does later on), can we give these derivatives an interpretation somehow analogous to the analytical one that goes with the $f(z)\in\mathbb{C}[z]$ polynomials? I'm asking this because if there is no interpretation other than ""coefficientes of the expansion"", it seems like a very artificial analogy to me. I mean, if not, why would he even mention derivatives instead of just saying something like: ""we expand functions this way, we expand integers this way and it's kind of similar."" Any explanations and/or motivations are welcome.
Thanks in advance.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

\in (a, b)$. Suppose that $\lim \limits_{x \to c} f'(x) = l \in \Bbb

\begin{cases}
x + 1  & \text{if $-1\lt x \lt $ 0 } \\
x & \text{if $ \; 0 \le x \lt 1$}

And this also tells us that $\lim \limits_{x \to 0} f'(x) = 1$. But $f$ is not differentiable at $0$ since $f$ is not continuous there. Where am I going wrong? P.

1367654,"Three different notions for ""bigness"" of a module (length, rank and ""mass"").","Let $M$ be an $R-$module where $R$ is an integral domain. I'm trying to understand the relations between these three notions of size: Let $S \subset M$ be a generating set of minimal cardinality . Define $|S| = mass(M)$ (I don't know any formal term for this so i'll use this one. Sorry.). Let $T \subset M$ be a maximal linearly independent set (A set $T$ is linearly independent iff the natural homomorphism from $R^{\oplus T}$ to $M$ is injective). Define $|T| = {rk}_R(M)$. By Jordan–Hölder for modules, all composition series of a module have the same length. Define $length(M)$ as that length. For vector spaces (i .e. if $R$ is a field) all the notions coincide. (please correct me if i'm wrong). Suppose $M$ is free and of finite length. We know $M$ is free iff it admits a basis. So $M \cong R^{\oplus B}$ where $B \subset M$ is a linearly independent subset. By splitting the composition series we find that $M$ is isomorphic to a sum of simple modules. That is: $$M \cong \bigoplus_{j \in J} N_j \cong R^{\oplus B}$$
Can we now deduce that $length(M)=mass(M)={rk}_R(M)$? Suppose $M$ is projective and of finite length. 
We have again, by splitting, that $M \cong \bigoplus_{j \in J} N_j $. Do we have $length(M)=mass(M)$? What about ${rk}_R(M)$? Suppose $M$ is noetherian . Clearly $mass(M)$ is finite. Must $length(M)$ be finite? What if we add that $M$ is projective (/free)? I'd like to have a more organized picture of how these notions interact with each other on different modules.

f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(n^2 x)}{n}\, .

Now, obviously this is a very jagged function. (I think the derivative doesn't exist anywhere.) However, it seems to go to a finite, positive limit as $x\rightarrow 0_+$. Furthermore, just looking at the first few decimal places of this limit, it looks like it may be $\pi/4$. It seems plausible that such a limit might go to a ""nice"" number like $\pi/4$, but I can't prove it. A few known things about this problem: 1) $f(x)$ is odd, so $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{-}} f(x) = -\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{+}} f(x)$. 2) $f(x)$ is $2\pi$-periodic (obviously). 3) One possible way that occurs to me to evaluate this limit (if it exists), is to replace it with the following:
\begin{align}
\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{+}} f(x)
&= \lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{+}} \frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x} dy\, f(y)\\
&= \lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{+}} \frac{2}{x}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin^2\left(n^2 x/2\right)}{n^3}
