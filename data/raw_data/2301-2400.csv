16018,"linear system solution, iterative vs direct","Dear all,
I have systems like $(A - \lambda B) X = F$ where lambda is being updated inside a loop. I also have a limited number of eigenvectors of the matrix pair (A, B), say 40 eigenpair from a previous analysis step. I could get the results with direct solution however due to repeated factorization of the operator matrix, I run into the O(n^3) wall. I was wondering if that could be possible to solve this system by some iterative methods. I, myself, tried some iterative methods, cg, minres, and others firstly in MATLAB, however cg like methods do not even converge due to the nature of the operator matrix since that can become indefinite in the loop, minres seems to converge hovewer that also does not converge in reasonable iteration counts. Also in these tries I had to use a PD preconditioner and do a factorization, which also induces other costs. Basically are there some kind of a mathematical tricks for this kind of problem, where some limited number of eigenpairs are available from a previous analysis step? As a poor engineer I tried all I know, so any further ideas? TIA,

16022,Addition on big omega notation,"It seems to my uneducated mind that if I have $\frac{n}{k}$ subproblems, each of size $\Omega (k \log k)$, that my overall problem must be at least of size $\Omega (n \log k)$, by the reasoning that if I have $\frac{n}{k}$ things, each of which is at least $k \log k$, I should be able to multiply those together to get a lower bound for their sum. However, my TA seems to disagree with me, stating that addition is not defined on $\Omega (f(x)) + \Omega (g(x))$, and therefore I can't sum or multiply the subproblems in this fashion. I was wondering if someone could explain the error in my reasoning.","['computer-science', 'discrete-mathematics']"
16033,Numerically solving ODEs — how to estimate the solution between the nodes?,"I have heard about a lot of fancy numerical methods for solving ODEs. I know that there are methods that (assuming sufficient smoothness) asymptotically give a low error, like the Runge-Kutta methods.  These estimate the solution in a set of points $t_0$ , $t_1$ , etc. But what if I want to have a function that is close to the correct solution everywhere, not just in a discrete set of points? I can extend the numerical solution to a piecewise linear function. This will be a continuous function and it will converge to the correct solution if the step-size goes to zero. But the error estimate will be poor in most places unless I use a very small step-size, which rather defeats the purpose of using a high-order method. So how does one go about estimating the solution in practice between the $t_i$ ?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"

Are there better books for multivariable calculus? (I don't think I want to jump right into Calculus on manifolds .)

16057,A problem with minimizing a function,"I have the following cost function: $\mbox{BSP Cost}=\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{G}}G^{2}\left\lceil \frac{i}{p}\right\rceil +g\left(p\right)\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{G}}Gi+l\left(p\right)\frac{n}{G}$ I would like to minimize it by choosing an appropriate G (i.e., G is a function of p and n). I have simplified it to the following form: $\mbox{BSP Cost}=\frac{Gn}{2p}+\frac{n^{2}}{2p}+g\left(p\right)\cdot\left(\frac{n}{2G}+\frac{n^{2}}{2G^{2}}\right)+l\left(p\right)\frac{n}{G}\to\min$ To find the minimization, I used a derivative $\frac{d}{dG}$ on the cost function, and compared to zero. I got this: $\frac{nG^{3}-g\left(p\right)npG-g\left(p\right)n^{2}p-2l\left(p\right)npG}{2pG^{3}}=0$ $nG^{3}-g\left(p\right)npG-g\left(p\right)np-2l\left(p\right)npG=0$ And I'm not sure how to proceed from this point.

The only test that was successful for me is the Kummer Test which gave the apparently correct result that it converges if $z > \frac{1}{2}$. To get there I use the fact that the series $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } a_n$ converges (when the limit exists) if $\lim_{n\to \infty } \, n
   \left(\frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}-1\right) > 1$ Using Mathematica I get $\lim_{n\to \infty } \, n

16098,When is an infinite sum of polynomials analytic?,"Consider the following function: $ f(x) = \sum_{i,j>=0} a_{ij} x^i (1-x)^j$ , where the coefficients satisfy $a_{ij} \in [0,1]$. Observe that $f(x)$ converges for $x\in [0,1]$. Is $f$ analytic over $[0,1]$? If not, how about over $[c,d]$ for $c,d \in (0,1)$? I think I can show that the answer is yes for the $[c,d]$ case by showing uniform convergence (EDIT: I was wrong... Not sure I can anymore). Is there a simpler way? More importantly, are there nice general conditions that guarantee that the infinite sum of polynomials is analytic over the interval (or a proper sub-interval) of convergence? This motivates the following questions: Question 1: Let $f(x) = \sum_{i,j} a_{ij} x^i (1-x)^j$, where there are no guarantees on $a_{ij}$. Assume $f$ converges on interval $[a,b]$.   Is $f(x)$ analytic over $[a,b]$? What about over $[c,d]$ where $c,d \in (a,b)$? Question 2: Let $f(x) = \sum_k p_k(x)$, where $p_k$ is a polynomial. Assume $f$ converges on interval $[a,b]$, and that $p_k(x) \geq 0$ for $x \in [a,b]$.   Is $f(x)$ analytic over $[a,b]$? What about over $[c,d]$ where $c,d \in (a,b)$? Question 3: Same as question 2, but there are no guarantees on the sign of $p_k(x)$ anymore. (EDIT: As Jonas Meyer pointed out, this is false by the Weierstrass approximation theorem) I guess what I'm trying to get at is understanding which natural conditions, short of manually showing uniform convergence, guarantee that a convergent sum of polynomials is analytic over its region of convergence (or a sub-interval of that). Question 1 starts with a very specific sum of polynomials that I somewhat understand, and Questions 2 and 3 are grasping at a generalization. These questions are my best guesses as to what generalizations may look like, though please feel free to suggest others if I'm off-base here.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Notes: I am having serious problems of finding such a subsequence, first I see what the sequence does.

Example: let $x=\pi$, then we get $a(0)=0.141592..., a(1)=0.41592..., a(2)=0.1592...$ and so on.

16175,On sort-of-linear functions: does $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ imply $f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x)$?,"Background A function $ f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \ $ is linear if it satisfies $$ f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) \ \text {, and} \tag 1 \label 1 $$ $$ f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x) \tag 2 \label 2 $$ for all $ x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n $ and all $ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} $ . A function satisfying only \eqref{2} is not necessarily linear.  For example* $ f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R} \ $ defined by $ f(x) = |x| \ $ (where $ |x| \ $ is the $ L^2 $ norm) satisfies \eqref{2} but is not linear .  However, a function satisfying \eqref{1} does satisfy a weaker version of \eqref{2}, namely $$ f(ax)=af(x) \tag {2b} \label {2b} $$ for all $ a \in \mathbb{Q} $ . *Edit:  As pointed out in the comments this example doesn't quite work since $|ax|=|a||x|$ . When $ f $ is continuous it's relatively straight-forward to show that under the extra hypothesis that $ f $ is continuous, \eqref{2b} implies \eqref{2}.  I want to say that continuity is a necessary condition for \eqref{1} to imply \eqref{2}, or at least (worst) there is some extra hypothesis required (possibly weaker than continuity), but I'm not sure how to show it. My question is therefore two-fold: Is continuity a necessary condition for \eqref{1} to imply \eqref{2} and how could I go about proving it. What are some examples (if there are any) of a function satisfying \eqref{1} but not \eqref{2}? This can be stated in a slightly more general context as follows:
Suppose $ V\ $ is a vector space over $ \mathbb{R}\ $ and $ f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\ $ satisfies $$ f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y) \tag {1'} $$ for all $ x,y \in V $ . Under what conditions is $ f\ $ a vector space homomorphism? The reason I believe continuity is necessary is because of the similarity to the fact that $ x^{\alpha} x^{\beta} = x^{\alpha + \beta} $ for all $ \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{R} $ .  Irrational powers can be defined either via continuity (i.e. if $ \alpha \ $ is irrational, then $ x^{\alpha}:= \lim_{q\to \alpha} x^q \ $ where q takes on only rational values) or by using the exponential and natural logarithm functions, and either way proving the desired identity boils down to continuity. I have come up with one example that satisfies (something similar to) \eqref{1} and not \eqref{2}, but it doesn't quite fit the bill: $ \ $ Define $ \phi : \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right) \to \mathbb{Q} \ $ defined by $ \phi\left(a+b\sqrt{2}\right) = a+b $ .  Then $ \phi(x+y) = \phi(x)+\phi(y) \ $ but if $ \alpha=c+d\sqrt{2} \ $ then $ \phi\Big(\alpha\left(a+b\sqrt{2}\right)\Big) = ac+2bd + ad+bc \neq \alpha \ \phi\left(a+b\sqrt{2}\right) $ . $ \ $ The problem is that even though $ \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right) \ $ is a vector space over $ \mathbb{Q} $ , the $ \alpha \ $ is coming from $ \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{2}\right) \ $ instead of the base field $ \mathbb{Q} $ .","['functions', 'functional-equations']"

16184,Defining compatibility between a function $F\colon A\times A\to A$ and an equivalence relation $R$ on $A$,"I'm working my way through Enderton's Elements of Set Theory, and one of the theorems from the book has a final note that is giving me some trouble. The theorem is found on page 60, and is as follows: Theorem 3Q Assume that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ and that $F\colon A\to A$. If $F$ is compatible with $R$, then there exists a unique $\hat{F}\colon A/R\to A/R$ such that 
  $$
  (*)\qquad \hat{F}([x])=[F(x)]\quad\text{for all $x\in A$.}
  $$
  If $F$ is not compatible with $R$, then no such $\hat{F}$ exists. Analogous results apply to functions from $A\times A$ into $A$. For $F\colon A\to A$, we say $F$ is compatible with $R$ if for all $x,y\in A$, 
$$
xRy\implies F(x)RF(y).
$$ I'm trying to formulate and prove the mentioned analogous results for $F\colon A\times A\to A$. I imagine the corresponding theorem would be Theorem 3Q' Assume that $R$ is an equivalence relation on $A$ and that $F\colon A\times A\to A$. If $F$ is compatible with $R$, then there exists a unique $\hat{F}\colon A/R\times A/R\to A/R$ such that 
  $$
  (**)\qquad \hat{F}([x],[y])=[F(x,y)]\quad\text{for all $x,y\in A$.}
  $$
  If $F$ is not compatible with $R$, then no such $\hat{F}$ exists. but of course I may be wrong! I suppose the definition of compatibility requires some retooling, and the only sensible formulation I could think of was $F$ and $R$ are compatible if for any $x,y\in A$, 
$$
xRy\implies F(x,y)RF(y,x).
$$ This is what I have so far, but as a warning, I don't think it really goes anywhere. Based on this, I try to show that if $F$ is compatible with $R$, then such a $\hat{F}$ exists. Since $(**)$ requires that $(([x],[y]), [F(x,y)])\in\hat{F}$, I try to define $\hat{F}$ as
$$
\hat{F}=\{(([x],[y]), [F(x,y)])\ |\ x,y\in A\}.
$$
I want $\hat{F}$ to indeed be a function, so I consider the pairs $(([x],[y]), [F(x,y)])$ and $(([u],[v]), [F(u,v)])$ in $\hat{F}$. I would then like to have the implications
\begin{align*}
([x],[y])=([u],[v]) &\implies [x]=[u]\wedge [y]=[v] \newline
&\implies xRu\wedge yRv\newline
&\implies F(x,u)RF(u,x)\wedge F(y,v)RF(v,y)\newline
&\implies [F(x,u)]=[F(u,x)]\wedge [F(y,v)]=[F(v,y)]\newline
&\implies \underline{\hspace{1in}} \newline
&\implies [F(x,y)]=[F(u,v)]
\end{align*} However, I don't know what to put in the blank to make the desired implication follows, so perhaps my idea of compatibility or something else is wrong. Can someone please explain how to get to the proper formulation of the analogous results? Thanks!","['relations', 'equivalence-relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
16203,Why doesn't Hom commute with taking stalks?,"I have been learning about sheaves and am thinking about the following problem. Let $F$ and $G$ be sheaves, say of abelian groups, on a space $X$. The sheaf $Hom(F, G)$ is defined by $Hom(F, G)(U)=Mor(F|_U, G|_U)$.  Given a point $p \in X$ and an open set $U$ containing $p$, a morphism $\varphi: F|_U \rightarrow G|_U$ induces a homomorphism on stalks $\phi: F_p \rightarrow G_p$, which is an element of $Hom(F_p, G_p)$.  Thus, by the universal property of direct limits, we have a homomorphism from $Hom(F, G)_p$ to $Hom(F_p, G_p)$.  However, this is not in general injective or surjective.  Why not?

However at the root test, I am stuck at: (For convenience I drop the limes superior in the following equations, but it should be in front of every expression.) $\sqrt[n]{\frac{n^n}{(n!)^2}}=\frac{n}{\sqrt[n]{n!}\sqrt[n]{n!}}$ Is there some estimate of $\sqrt[n]{n!}$ I should know of?

I managed to show (with some help) that the limit $f$ (of a subsequence) satisfies $\int_0^x f \ dm=0$ for all $x>0 $. From this I want to conclude that $f=0$ a.e.

16253,How to check if a subset is a generator of a vector space,"I have a very noob questions about generators: what algorithm do I have to follow so I can prove that a finite subset is a generator? Here is the background story (I'll tell it all because I suck at maths and I might have understood the whole concept wrongly): I want to know how to compute the image of a vector space morphism. I'll continue on a concrete example: $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $f(x,y) = (x-y, 2x + y)$ is the morphism. To find its image, I observe that $f(x,y)$ can be rewritten as $x(1,2) + y(-1,1)$. If I am correct, that means that $\mathrm{Im}(f) = \langle(1,2), (-1,1)\rangle$ (that's the notation we use for set generators). Now the question is: does the $\{(1,2), (-1,1)\}$ set generate $\mathbb{R}^2$ or not?","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"
16270,1981 Putnam problem A-3 : Differentiating under a double integral?,"I was trying some old problems and got stuck on this one. Then when I looked at the answer there was a step I could not understand. Perhaps you can explain it to me. A-3 Find $ \displaystyle \lim_{t \to \infty}\left[ e^{-t}\int_0^t \int_0^t \frac{e^x - e^y}{x - y}dx dy \right]$ or show that the limit does not exist. Solution Let $G(t)$ be the double integral.  Then $\lim\limits_{t \to \infty}\frac{G(t)}{e^t} = \lim\limits_{t \to \infty}\frac{G'(t)}{e^t}$ by L'Hopital.  Then
$$G'(t) = \int_0^t \frac{e^x-e^t}{x-t}dx+ \int_0^t \frac{e^y-e^t}{y-t}dy$$
so
$$G'(t) = 2\int_0^t \frac{e^x-e^t}{x-t}dx.$$ Then, the answer continues to show that  $\lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{G'(t)}{e^t}=\infty$ since,
$$\frac{G'(t)}{2e^t} = \int_0^t \frac{e^{x-t}-1}{x-t}dx = \int_0^t\frac{1-e^{-y}}{y}dy > \int_1^t\frac{1-e^{-y}}{y}dy > \left(1-e^{-1}\right)log\,t.$$
My question is how $G'(t)$ was found.  I understand the rest of the solution.

16356,Curvature $0$ and involutive horizontal distributions,"I am trying to check why curvature $0$ implies that the horizontal distribution is involutive. Let $\pi:P\to U$ be a principal $G:=GL_n$ bundle. Assume that $P$ is trivial and $\pi$ admits a section. Thus, $P\cong U\times G$. A connection on $P$ is a $G$ equivariant splitting of the short exact sequence of bundles $0\to P\times\mathfrak{g} \to TU\oplus TG\to \pi^*TU\to 0$. Let us denote this splitting by $s$. If $(v,u)$ is a tangent vector at the point $(x,g)$, then $s(v,u)=w_x(v)+(R_{g^{-1}})_*(u)$, where $w\in\Gamma(X,\Omega_U\otimes\mathfrak{g})$. Let $x_1,x_2,...x_n$ be coordinates on $U$ and consider vector fields $X_i$ corresponding to them. Use these to construct horizontal $G$ invariant vector fields on $P$ which are given by $((X_i)_x, -w_x((X_i)_x))$ at the point $(x,Id)$. This should give an involutive distribution on $P$. Using that $[X_1,X_2]=0$, when we compute the Lie bracket, we get 
$[(X_1,-w(X_1)),(X_2,-w(X_2))]=-[w(X_1),X_2]-[X_1,w(X_2)]+[w(X_1),w(X_2)]$.
=$X_2(w(X_1))-X_1(w(X_2))+[w(x_1),w(X_2)]$. We need to show that this is $0$. The condition that curvature is 0 is given by $dw+w\wedge w=0$, i.e. $dw_{ij}+\sum_{k=0}^{n}w_{ik}\wedge w_{kj}=0$. This means that $dw(X_1,X_2)+[w(x_1),w(X_2)]=0$, which is same as saying that $X_1(w(X_2))-X_1(w(X_2))+[w(x_1),w(X_2)]=0$ There seems to be some mismatch.",['differential-geometry']

16366,"Linear Algebra, cube & dimensions > 3","I have found interesting problem in Gilbert's Strang book, ,,Introduction to Linear Algebra'' (3rd edition): How many corners does a cube have in 4 dimensions? How many faces? How many edges? A typical corner is $(0,0,1,0)$ I have found the answer for corners: We know, that corner is $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$. For every $x_i$ we can use either $1$ or $0$. We can do this in $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2^4 = 16$ ways. The same method can be used for general problem of cube in $n$ dimensions (I suppose): Let's say, we have $n$-dimensional cube (I assume, that length of edge is $1$, but it can be some $a$, where $a \in \mathbb{R}$ [1]). Here, corner of this cube looks like this: $(x_1,x_2, \ldots , x_n)$. For every $x_i$ there are $2$ possibilities: $x_i = 0$ or $x_i = 1$ ($x_i = a$ in general). So, this cube has $2^n$ corners. It was pretty simple, I think. But now, there are also faces and edges. To be honest, I do not know, how to find the answer in this cases. I know, that solution for this problem is: A four-dimensional cube has $2^4 = 16$ corners and $2 \cdot 4 = 8$ three-dimensional sides and $24$ two-dimensional faces and $32$ on-dimensional edges.

If two or more assets in a portfolio correlate too highly it concentrates rather than diversifying the risk. What we want We want an approach or method to construct a portfolio of assets that minimizes the portfolio’s “concentration” risk. I’ll illustrate concentration risk with a couple of examples below, but first... Why this is an interesting problem or question? A couple of things make this an interesting and challenging question: While related to “efficient frontier”
we have no assumptions about future
performance for the individual
instruments to use. Minimizing variance gives an answer,
but not an intuitively satisfying or
even useful one. Principal Components Analysis seems a
natural way to look at this, but also
doesn’t appear to give us what we
need. We’ve looked at using entropy
maximization, but while one of our
guys familiar with discrete entropy
thought it seemed promising, when we
tried thinking about this in terms of continuous entropy it proved a dead end. A couple of simple examples to illustrate concentration risk It's easiest to understand what we want to achieve if we look at a portfolio of 3 assets in a thought experiment.  Assume 2 of the instruments have correlations of 1 (100%) and the third at 0, it's correlation matrix would look like this: 1, 1, 0 1, 1, 0 0, 0, 1 From our perspective in this case, it would make sense to put 25% in each of the 2 correlated stocks and 50% in the uncorrelated one. 25%,   25%,   50% This offsets the risk of concentrating in correlated instruments, while recognizing that the 100% correlated assets are in fact still different instruments whose correlation in the future may change. One might make the case that as the two assets that have 100% correlation move the same, then a wide range of possible allocations could equally serve our purposes e.g: 50%,    0%,    50% 0%,     50%,   50% 10%,    40%,   50% ... or any such variations on the theme. But, as we don’t know how their future correlation will evolve, we think the best and most intuitive solution remains at: 25%,  25%,  50% Another example In a portfolio of 5 assets with 4 having 100% correlation and 1 having 0% correlation the correlation matrix would look like the following: 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 and the portfolio allocation we want would have the following proportions: 12.5%,   12.5%,   12.5%,   12.5%,   50% Of course the real world presents us with greater complication. Things we’ve tried Minimizing variance (promising but doesn’t work) Someone suggested minimizing variance to do this, but as one can see it doesn’t produce an intuitive solution: Some Mathematica code illustrating this follows: For 3 assets: m3 = {{1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0 }, { 0, 0 , 1}}; Array[x, Length@m3]; Minimize[{p.m3.p, Tr@p == 1 && And @@ Thread[p >= 0]}, p] {1/2, {x[1] -> 1/4, x[2] -> 1/4, x[3] -> 1/2}} This looks good.  It gives us: 25%,   25%,   50% but... For 5 assets: m5 = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 0}, {1 , 1, 1, 1, 0 }, {1 , 1, 1, 1, 0 }, {1 , 1,1, 1, 0 }, { 0, 0 , 0, 0, 1}}; p = Array[x, Length@m5]; Minimize[{p.m5.p, Tr@p == 1 && And @@ Thread[p >= 0]}, p] {1/2, {x[1] -> 1/16, x[2] -> 1/4, x[3] -> 1/8, x[4] -> 1/16, x[5] ->1/2}} Not so good as it gives us: 6.25%,   25%,   12.50%,   6.25%,   50% So, minimizing variance doesn’t work even for this simple (if artificial) case let alone something more realistic. A promising solution One contributor to our discussion suggested a promising approach - at least for cases that do not have any negative correlations.  Perhaps it would lead someone to suggest a more complete solution. Again with Mathematica code:
 
m = {{1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}; Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]/Tr[ Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]] {1/4, 1/4, 1/2} Exactly what we would want.
Note: For those not familiar with Mathematica code the functions: “Tr” finds the trace of a matrix and “/@” maps a function to a list or matrix.  The rest probably makes sense. Another example for four assets:
 
m = {{1, 1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}}; Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]/Tr[ Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]] {1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/2} Again, exactly what we want. This works better than minimizing variance, but in a more real world example (the first one described in the post) we get something that doesn’t work: m = {{1.0, 0.635562, 0.698852, 0.404792, -0.32746},
 {0.635562, 1.0, 0.410075, 0.314375, -0.0636438},
 {0.698852, 0.410075, 1.0, 0.374416, -0.260137},
 {0.404792, 0.314375, 0.374416, 1.0, 0.293135},
 {-0.32746, -0.0636438, -0.260137, 0.293135, 1.0}} Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]/Tr[ Tr /@ PseudoInverse[m]] {0.267806, 0.0898877, 0.22403, -0.0541658, 0.472441} In this case we have a negative allocation (-0.0541658) for the 4th asset, something that doesn’t make sense for what we want to achieve. Conclusion So, we need a kind of MinimizeVarianceIntuitively function.  I hope all of this describes what we want to achieve clearly enough.  Any suggestions or ideas for attacking this problem in completely different ways or for extending any of the things we’ve tried already much appreciated.

16455,How to evaluate probability estimators with only external information?,"Here's a problem that I have pondered over many times without ever coming to a satisfactory solution: Let's say that we have a series of random events: V(i) for I = 1 to n.  Each of these events will have a result VR(i) of either 0 or 1, and a probability VP(i) (from zero to one) that represents the probability that VR(i) = 1. We also have a group of k estimators: E(j) for j = 1 to k, that generate EP(j,i) which are estimates of VP(i). What I want is an evaluation function F(j) that given EP(j,i={1..n})  (that is, E(j)'s estimates of VP(i) for i = 1 to n), and VR(i={1 to n}) (i.e., the actual results), that will return a number that is a ""good"" valuation of E(j)'s ability to estimate VP(i). Some Notes: The results, VR(i), are known to the Evaluation function, but (obviously) not to the Estimators, neither before or after each result (so the estimators cannot use the VR(i)'s to adjust their subsequent predictions, if that matters). The probabilities, VP(i), are not known to the Evaluation function. The distribution of the probabilities VP(i) is not know to the Evaluation function. EP(j,i) is supposed to be an estimate of the event probabilities , VP(i), and not an estimate of the results , VR(i).  Virtually every valuation system that I have seen tends to weight each EP(j,i) solely on its closeness to VR(i), which invariably rewards ""polarized"" estimators: those that always return 1 if VP(i) > 0.5 and 0 if VP(i) < 0.5. One hallmark of the problem in #4 is that if VP(i) = 0.5, then these types of valuation systems will tend to reward all EP(j,i)'s the same, or else give the highest reward to EP's of 0 or 1, and the worst valuation to the actual correct estimate, 0.5.  What I would like, of course, is just the opposite: for estimates of 0 or 1 for actual probabilities of 0.5 to receive the worst valuation while the correct estimates of 0.5 to be rated the highest. This I think is also the essence of the difficulty in this problem: how do I correctly value the probability estimates (and estimators) if I only know the event results, but not the actual probabilities being estimated?","['probability-theory', 'approximation', 'probability']"

16501,"Generalizations of the number theory concepts of ""even"" and ""odd""?","One of the very first number theory concepts introduced to students -- even before primeness, divisibility, etc. -- is the idea that a natural number can either be ""even"" (that is, evenly divisible by 2) or ""odd"" (all other numbers).  For all intents and purposes, at that time, even and odd numbers were evenly distributed and of the same density in the natural numbers. There always seemed to be something inherently ""special"" about a number's evenness or oddness, besides the trivial one that members of one class could be divided equally into two groups and the other cannot.  One would memorize addition and multiplication tables of evenness and oddness (an odd number will remain odd when added to ANY even number).  You could not iterate through all of the even numbers through multiplication alone, while you could for the odds. I've heard the chess board being described as possessing evenness and oddness.  For example, dark squares and light squares can represent either even or odd.  A diagonal move can be an ""even"" move and a side-to-side move is an ""odd"" one, and moves are represented as additions to a square. In this way, a knight's move is an ""odd"" move (odd+odd+even), and when added to an odd square will yield an even square; when added to an even square will yield an odd square (odd + odd = even, odd + even = odd)
A bishop's move can be considered always even, so once a bishop is on an odd square, it can only ever move onto other odd squares.  Likewise for bishops on even squares. Are there any more generalizations of this concept to math?  Is it meaningful to talk of even or odd matrices, or even or odd vectors or vector spaces? I've heard the concept applied to functions (even or odd functions), but I don't know if they are related to this by anything other than their name.","['parity', 'number-theory']"

Is there an easy way to find the roots as rational expressions in $x$? The easiest example is a pure quadratic: $X^2 + 7$ for instance.  If $A$ is a root, then so is $−A$.  Good ole $\pm\sqrt{−7}$. If the Galois group is abelian (like for any quadratic), then all of the roots can be expressed as polynomials in a given root.  However, I am not sure how to tell by looking at the polynomial if its Galois group is abelian, and even if it is, I am not sure how to find those rational expressions for the other roots. It might help to see some non-Abelian (non-Galois) examples: If $A$ is a root of $X^6 + 2X^4 − 8$, then $−A$ is also a root, but its other $4$ roots cannot be expressed as rational functions of $A$ (assuming I still understand Galois theory). Is there some easy way (not asking a CAS to calculate the Galois group) to see the other $4$ roots of of $X^6 + 2X^4 − 8$ cannot be expressed as rational functions of $A$? This one had the nice feature that it was a function of $X^2$, so it was easy to find two roots.  For $X^6 − 2X^5 + 3X^3 − 2X − 1$, I still have not found its other root (even using a CAS). If $A$ is a root of $X^6 − 2X^5 + 3X^3 − 2X − 1$, then what is a rational expression in $A$ for another root? This all first came up with the polynomial $x^4−4x^2+2$, where several distinct ad hoc arguments each sufficed, but I had no real understanding of how to even tell if my ad hoc arguments were worth trying on other polynomials.  If it helps, the roots are $A$, $−A$, $A^3−3A$, and $3A−A^3$. The context is hand calculations and reasonable degrees (say $\leq 10$), though I am not opposed to having a polynomial evaluation oracle that computes $f(g(x)) \mod f(x)$ in $1$ second (so ""try this finite and not too big list of possible roots"" is ok). If someone is interested, I am curious what the normalizer of a point stabilizer in the Galois group actually means in terms of Galois theory.  The index of the point stabilizer in its normalizer is the number of roots of $f$ in $\Bbb{Q}[x]/(f)$, but I'm not sure if it really means anything useful.","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

So far I know there exists some bijection $\sigma : S \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$. If I can define a bijection $\tau : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$, then a one-to-one correspondence between $S$ and $S \times S$ is given by $\mu$ such that $s_\mu = (a_{\sigma^{-1}},b_{\sigma^{-1}})$, with $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$ given by $s_{\sigma \circ \tau} = (a,b)$. I'm having trouble defining $\tau$. I think a possible way to do so would be to create some kind of spiral (like the Ulam spiral), and assign each point to a different integer. I suppose this would be a one-to-one correspondence but I'm at a loss on how to prove it. Thanks a lot!",['elementary-set-theory']
16630,Nice application of the Cauchy?-Frobenius?-Burnside?-Pólya? formula,"Burnside's Lemma , whose list of names is longer than the proof, says that the number of orbits of a permutation group is the average number of fixed points of its elements. It's a very elegant result, but I'm a bit disappointed by the fact that the examples given in the textbooks always amount to counting some colorings of a symmetric object, up to symmetry (the less original example probably being the cube). My question is then: do you know some funnier (but still rather direct) applications of this result?","['group-theory', 'soft-question', 'combinatorics']"

16637,Existence of open set in product topology,"Let $X$ be a compact topological space and $Y$ a Hausdorff space. Let $C \subseteq Y$ be closed in $Y$ and $U$ an open set in $X \times Y$ which contains $X \times C$. Prove there exists an open set $V \subseteq Y$ such that $X \times C \subseteq X \times V \subseteq U$. Here's what I tried. Let $b \in C$ fixed. For each $x \in X$ find open sets $U_{x}$ and $V_{x}$ in $X$, $Y$ respectively containing $x$ and $b$. Then the colecction $\{U_{x}: x \in X\}$ covers $X$ so by compactness of $X$ , we have $X \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} U_{i}$. From here how to obtain the open set $V$ ?, if we take $V$ as the finite intersection of the V_{i} then this won't satisfy $X \times V \subseteq U$. Also I don't see where to use the hypothesis that $C$ is closed. I don't think the above approach works. Can you please help? Thanks.",['general-topology']
16638,"A converse of sorts to the intermediate value theorem, with an additional property","I need to solve the following problem: Suppose $f$ has the intermediate value property, i.e. if $f(a)<c<f(b)$, then there exists a value $d$ between $a$ and $b$ for which $f(d)=c$, and also has the additional property that $f^{-1}(a)$ is closed for every $a$ in a dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is continuous. I can see plenty of counterexamples when the second property is not added, but I can't seem to bridge the gap between adding the property and proving $f$ is continuous. I can't get there either directly or by contradiction, because the additional property doesn't seem directly relevant to the property of continuity, so could anyone please tell me how to go about doing this?

16640,Continuous bijections from the open unit disc to itself - existence of fixed points,"I'm wondering about the following: Let $f:D \mapsto D$ be a continuous real-valued bijection from the open unit disc $\{(x,y): x^2 + y^2 <1\}$ to itself. Does f necessarily have a fixed point? I am aware that without the bijective property, it is not necessarily true - indeed, I have constructed a counterexample without any trouble. However, I suspect with bijectivity it may be the case. I'm aware of the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem and I imagine these two are intricately linked. However, i'm not certain where the bijectivity comes in - I believe we can argue something along the lines f now necessarily maps boundary to boundary - something about how if $x^2+y^2 \to 1$, $\|f(x,y)\| \to 1$ maybe. However, how does this help? Even if we could definitely define a limit to f(x,y) along the whole boundary and apply Brouwer, we can't guarantee the fixed points aren't all on the boundary anyway. Conversely however, I still can't construct a counterexample. Could anyone help me finish this off please? Thanks!","['fixed-point-theorems', 'examples-counterexamples', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
16641,"Trisect unknown angle using pencil, straight edge & compass; Prove validity of technique","This question was posed by my high school geometry teacher, for extra credit: Is it possible, using only a pencil, a straightedge (not a ruler) and a compass to trisect an angle of unknown value? If so, describe the technique, and mathematically prove its validity. If not, mathematically prove the impossibility. I recall wondering at the time, why he was posing this question to a freshman high school geometry class, and if he genuinely expected any of us to come up with an answer. Nothing more was said about it and to my knowledge, nobody submitted an answer. But the question stuck in my mind, and I would often spend hours puzzling over it, trying over and over to come up with a valid solution. I'll be 60 years old this July, and I'm no closer to an answer now than I was that day, so many years ago. If anyone knows the answer, I'd appreciate a simple explanation, as I am no mathematician.","['geometry', 'geometric-construction']"
16646,Why is first cohomology group of divisor sheaf on riemann surface zero?,"Let $X$ be riemann surface (not supposed compact) and $\mathcal D$ be sheaf of divisors on $X$.Remind that this means for $U\subset X$ open then $\mathcal D(U)$ is group of divisors on $U$.

This is exercise in §16 of Forster book Riemann Surfaces (but is not homework for me) and he says hint is to use discontinuous partitions of unit but I don't understand. Any other method for proving is for me also satisfying . I suppose $H^2(X,\mathcal D)$ is also zero, no? Addedd: Problem is in analytic category, not algebraic ( where is trivial : $\mathcal D$ is flabby).

16663,"Convergence of sequence of functions, $f_n(x) = n^2 x(1-nx) \dots $","Doing an exercise for exam preparation, I stumbled across the following function: $f_n(x)=  n^2x(1-nx),  \quad \text{if }0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{n} $ $f_n(x)=  0, \quad \text{if } \frac{1}{n} < x \leq 1$ The task is to find the limit of this function series and to determine whether this function converges uniformly in $[0,1]$ On the one hand $\frac{1}{n}$ approaches $0$ for $n \to \infty$. So one would just have to insert $0$ in $n^2x(1-nx)$. Thereby gaining $f_n(x) = 0$ for $n \to \infty$. On the other hand the function has a maximum for $x=\frac{n}{2}$. Putting this into $n^2x(1-nx)$ and calculating $f_n(x)$ for $n \to \infty$ afterwards one gets $f_n(x) = \infty$. So whats correct? How does one approach such a problem?

16695,Complexity of Counting the number of inducing $n$-gons,"Definition: A $n$-gon is simple if it has no self intersection and is in general position if no pair of its edges are parallel. It is clear that by extending the edges of each simple $n$-gon in general position we would achieve a set of $n$ lines such that no pair of lines are parallel and no triple of lines intersect in a common point.
Let’s call the  $n$-gon as inducing $n$-gon and the set of lines as induced arrangement of $n$ lines. It is interesting to consider the reverse, and think about finding such an inducing $n$-gon in a given arrangement of $n$ lines which induces the arrangement, and therefore each line of the arrangement should contain exactly one side of the inducing $n$-gon. It is clear that there are arrangements that cannot be induced by a simple polygon; an arrangement of lines that all intersect in one point, and an arrangement of lines that forms a $3$ \texttimes $2$ parallel grid serve as examples of such arrangements. It has been proved that every simple arrangement of lines contains at least one inducing $n$-gon. It is clear that an inducing $n$-gon for an simple arrangement is not unique and there are lots of inducing $n$-gons. Is there any suggestion or idea about complexity of counting the number of inducing $n$-gons in a simple arrangement of $n$ lines?","['discrete-mathematics', 'discrete-geometry', 'computational-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'combinatorics']"
