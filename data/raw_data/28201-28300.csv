261983,Lebesgue Measure vs. Product Measure,"I am going through exercise problems of Rudin, and I came across this question. Find an example of a positive continuous function $f$ in the open unit square in $\mathbb{R}^2$, whose integral (relative to Lebesgue measure) is finite but such that $\int_0^1 f_x(y) dy$ is infinite for some $x \in (0,1)$. (Here, $f_x(y) = f(x,y)$.) I tried thinking of cases when Fubini theorem fails, for example $\displaystyle f(x,y) = \frac{2x-1}{y}$, but I found it difficult to evaluate the integral in Lebesgue sense.

261988,number with finite binary representation and infinite decimal representation,"One can easily find numbers with finite decimal representation with infinite binary representation.

262018,Why does this statistic have an approximate $\chi_{\nu}^{2}$ Distribution?,"I am currently studying goodness of fit tests and the $\chi^{2}$ distribution. To calculate the goodness of fit of a theoretical distribution, we compute the quantity $$X^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}$$
Where $n$ is the number of outcomes, $O_{i}$ is the number of times the $i^{th}$ outcome is observed, and $E_{i}$ is the number of times we expect it to occur (given our distribution). My book then states $X^{2} \sim \chi^{2}_{\nu}$ approximately, where $\nu$ is an appropriate number of degrees of freedom for the data. It then defines the $\chi^{2}$ distribution as follows: If $Z_{i} \sim N(0,1)$ and $X=\sum_{i=1}^{\nu}Z_{i}^2$, then $X\sim \chi^{2}_{\nu}$. It also briefly proves that $X^{2}$ has an approximately $\chi^{2}$ distribution when $\nu=1$. My question is this: How do we prove that, for any $\nu$, $X^{2}$ has an approximately $\chi^{2}$ distribution? Intuitively I feel like this is the start of an induction proof, but I don't know how to show the inductive step. If this is the case, please show me how. NOTE: I have just noticed that there is an added condition: Each of the $E_{i}$ are greater than or equal to 5.","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"
262026,On the differential equation $y''+y=0$,"Consider the differential equation $$\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}+y=0$$
with initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y'(0)=1$. The solution is well known - $y=\sin(x)$. I know how to derive this solution, since the given equation is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, and characteristic equation $z^{2}+1=0$. I also know that this identity, combined with the initial conditions, allows us to compute $y^{(n)}(0)$ and thus the Maclaurin series of $y$, which coincides with the Maclaurin series of $\sin(x)$.  Neither of these proofs appear to use any property of $\sin(x)$ other than its oscillating derivatives. Does there exist a proof of the solution to this equation which uses some other properties to $\sin(x)$? If not, is there a way of visualising it, considering the connection of $\sin$ to the unit circle?","['trigonometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'intuition', 'alternative-proof']"

So if we have an Cauchy sequence $(f_n)$, define $f(x) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(x)$, we much show that $f\in C_b(\mathbb{R})$ and $\|f - f_n\| \leq \epsilon.$ How can I proceed?

262056,"Limit inferior, limit superior and Borel Cantelli lemmas","I am having trouble trying to understand the topic of my question. For reference please use Virtual Laboratory of Probability and Statistics . Let's start with limit superior:
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i$$
It works for arbitrary sequences of events $A_n$, right? Let's assume we have independent replication of the same basic event $A$ whose probability is strictly positive $\mathbb{P}(A) = p \in (0, 1]$, so that each $A_n$ is just $A$. And since set union and set intersection are both idempotent operations, we get:
$$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A = A$$
so that
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n = A$$
and
$$\mathbb{P} \left( \limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n \right) = \mathbb{P} \left( A \right) = p$$
So far, so good. But from the second Borel-Cantelli lemma, since $p > 0$, we get
$$\mathbb{P} \left( \limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n \right) = 1$$
For me it's hard to accept, that arbitrarily chosen $p \in (0, 1]$ will always be equal to 1. Where's my mistake? Anyway, what is that event $\limsup_{n \to \infty} A_n$? Since it is assigned probability 1, it must cover the entire sample space $\Omega$ of our probability space $(\Omega, \mathscr{F }, \mathbb{P})$, minus some countable subset. The first term in the definition of limit superior is $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty$, and it specifies a decreasing (non increasing) sequence of events. From this it follows that any of it ""tails"" $\bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i$ must have probability 1 -- $\mathbb{P} \left( \bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i \right) = 1$. Putting it all together, any of the ""tails"" $\bigcup_{i=n}^\infty A_i$ must include every possible event from the probability space. Is this line of thinking is correct? I mean, do I use the right words to describe my intuition behind limit superior/inferior? One last question, can limit superior/inferior of arbitrary sequence of events ever take any other probability different from 0 and 1?","['probability-theory', 'independence', 'convergence-divergence', 'limsup-and-liminf']"

262099,How to get more creative in Calculus,"I'm currently doing Calculus I (one variable and some max- min problems with two variables as well), and I can follow most proofs and understand most of all chapters in the book. It seems tough that when solving problems you really need to be creative, and it is this creativity that I lack at the moment. For instance, limits is of course a good example where it is not enough with just knowing the theory but you also need to be creative to find a solution. It seems like I have to manipulate expressions all the time before actually solving problems (now I'm speaking of calculation problems, not ""show that.."" problems). Is it just me or is there some ""creative structure"" I can follow when solving Calculus problems? There are so many different things to have in mind, and it feels like this course is almost going more on to memorizing formulas rather than actually understand them, which is frustrating. It just seems that knowing the theory really good is not just enough?","['calculus', 'learning']"

But how deduce that $X\times_S \mathrm{Spec}(k(t))\neq\emptyset$?

Idea 2: let $s=\varphi(t)$ and $x\in X$ so that $f(x)=s$ then $f(s)=\varphi(t)$.

262140,Showing the Measure of the Limsup of a Countable Sequence of Measurable Sets is Zero,"Let $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$ be a finite measure space and suppose $\{A_n\} \subseteq \mathcal{B}$ s.t. $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n) < \infty$.  Furthermore let  $\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{\text{limsup}}$ $A_n = S$. I aim to show that $\mu(S) = 0$.  Is the following proof (in particular, step 2) valid? First consider that $S = \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty \bigcup_{m=n}^\infty A_n$ is measruable since it is a countable intersection of a countable union of the measurable sets $A_n$. As an immediate consequence of the definition of $S$, we have that if $s \in S$, then $s \in A_n$ for an infinite number of the $A_n$.  Moreover, $S \subseteq A_n$ for an infinite number of the $A_n$. If for sake of contradiction we had that $0 < \mu(S) = r \in \mathbb{R}^+$, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n) \ge \sum_{k=1}^\infty \mu(S) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty r = \infty$, a contradiction since $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n) < \infty$ by hypothesis.

262187,Practical applications of first order exact ODE?,"In elementary ODE textbooks, an early chapter is usually dedicated to first order equations. It is very common to see individual sections dedicated to separable equations, exact equations, and general first order linear equations (solved via an integrating factor), not necessarily in that order. Common practical applications in these texts include population growth/decay, mixing problems, draining tank/Torricelli's Law problems, projectile motion, Newton's Law of Cooling, orthogonal trajectories, melting snowball type problems, certain basic circuits, growth of an annuity, and logistic population models. (This is just off the top of my head so maybe I am missing other popular ones.) However, all of these end up as separable or first order linear problems and are solved accordingly. Are there practical applications that lead to first order ODEs which are (exclusively) exact equations ? Edit: To clarify, I am not saying that exact equations are never useful. I am simply inquiring about their relevance/applicability in the very particular context mentioned above.

262318,Weak compactness of Sobolev spaces,"I am trying to understand a proof in Evan's book ""Partial Differential Equations"". We have a sequence $(u_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in $L^q(U)$ where $U$ is a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^m$. We know that $\sup_n||u_n||_{L^q(U)}<+\infty$ and $\sup_n||\nabla u_n||_{L^q(U,\mathbb{R}^m)}<+\infty$ (so $\sup_n||u_n||_{W^{1,q}(U)}<+\infty$). It is then said that there exists a subsequence $(u_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$ and a function $u \in W^{1,q}(U)$ such that $(u_{n_k})_k$ converges weakly to $u$ in $L^q(U)$ and $(\nabla u_{n_k})_k$ converges weakly to $\nabla u$ in $L^q(U,\mathbb{R}^m)$. The author abbreviate it in ""$(u_n)_n$ converges weakly to $u$ in $W^{1,q}(U)$"". I understand that from Rellich-Kondrachov theorem, we can extract a subsequence such that $(u_{n_k})_k$ converges to a function $u$ and then another subsequence such that $(\nabla u_{n_{k}})_k$ converges to a function $F$, but I don't understand why we would have $u \in W^{1,q}(U)$ and $\nabla u = F$. Perhaps we could directly use Rellich-Kondrachov with the weak convergence in $W^{1,q}(U)$ since $(u_n)_n$ is bounded in $W^{1,q}(U)$, but I thought this weak convergence only was an abbreviation and not really a weak convergence in a Banach Space...

262324,"Existence of a Strictly Increasing, Continuous Function whose Derivative is 0 a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$","This proof is almost done except for the step of showing that the function's derivative is $0$ a.e. Let $I = \{[p_n, q_n]\}$ denote the set of all closed intervals in $\mathbb{R}$ with rational endpoints $p_i, q_i \in \mathbb{Q}$. Let $\phi_n$ denote a variant of the Cantor Ternary Function (i.e., Devil's Staircase Function) extended to all $\mathbb{R}$ which satisfies $\phi_n(x) = 0$ for all $x < p_i$, $\phi_n(x) = 1/2^n$ for all $x > q_i$ and is non-decreasing, continuous, and of zero derivative a.e. on $[p_i,q_i]$ so that $\phi_n$ satisfies $\phi_n'(x) = 0$ a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$ $\phi_n$ non-decreasing, continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ $\phi_n$ is bounded above by $1/2^n$ $\phi_n (p_n) < \phi_n (q_n)$ (trivial but important later) Now let $\sum \phi_n = \phi$. $\fbox{Claim}$ $\sum \phi_n \rightarrow \phi$ uniformly $\phi$ is strictly increasing and continuous on $\mathbb{R}$ yet also satisfies $\phi'(x) = 0$ a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$. $\fbox{Attempted Proof}$ First since $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have that $|\phi_n| \le 1/2^n$ with $\sum 1/2^n < \infty$, it follows that $\sum \phi_n \rightarrow \phi$ uniformly (a fact from Real Analysis). Consider that the finite sum of $k$ continuous functions is itself a continuous function.  Since all of the $\phi_n$ are continuous functions, we therefore have that $f_k = \sum_{n=1}^k \phi_n$ is also a continuous function.  Moreover, since (1) implies that $f_k \rightarrow \phi$ unformly, we now have that $\phi$ is also continuous (via another Real Analysis fact that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions converges to another continuous function). To show $\phi$ is strictly increasing, consider $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $x < y$.  Since $\exists k \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $x < p_k < q_k < y$, we have that $\phi_k(x) \le \phi_k(p_k) < \phi_k(q_k) \le \phi_k(y)$ implies that $\phi_k(x) < \phi_k(y)$ so that for $N \ge k$ we have $\sum_{n = 1}^N \phi_n(x) < \sum_{n = 1}^N \phi_n(y)$ and more generally $\phi(x) < \phi(y)$.  This shows that indeed $\phi$ is strictly increasing on $\mathbb{R}$. To show that $\phi'(x) = 0$ a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$, we will show that $\phi' = \sum \phi_n' = \sum 0_n$, where each $0_n$ is the derivative function of $\phi_n$ which is $0$ almost everywhere.

262337,"Can you quantify a pattern as being ""more random""","(Link to refenced image ) I'm looking into the patterns used to position ""padfeet"" on a padfoot soil compactor.  The point of the feet is to gain an increased ground pressure, the downside is that as you roll over an area you only cover a certain percent of the ground, in this case 15% each time.(I've already calculated average % you will hit with each successive pass"" The pattern that is typically used is the chevron(bottom right, spaces removed).  What is done is that the operator will roll forward and back over and area, and then turn around 180 degrees and repeat up to 6-8 total passes.  The reversing is done to purposely decrease the chance of overlapping the ""V""'s. My question is, I've considered changing this to either the gull wing(bottom left and top with accurate spacing) or a even more scattered pattern such as putting row 5 as the 3rd impact, thus making a double chevron.  Looking at this, I visually perceive this to be a ""more random"" pattern, but is there a way quantify or define a difference between the changing patterns when they are both ""equal"" in their coverage.  Or is it just in my head. Thinking a bit more about it:  What I've calculated previously (with some assistance) is the % coverage from each pass""In general if the compactor affects p fraction of the area each time, after n passes it will have covered 1−(1−p)n of the area. So to cover 90% in 8 passes, you'll need just about 25% coverage on each pass, as 1−(1−.25)8≈90%."" The purpose of the 180 turn is to better mimic this calcuation, because you don't have a unique pattern hit with every pass, and if you overlap while just driving forwards and back you're likely to overlap with all 9 rows.  It seems like introducing a change to the pattern going around the drum, so that the pattern does not repeat identically for all 15 chevrons around the circumference, but adjusts slightly so that even when an overlap takes place it takes place to a lesser percent. That still doesn't tell me if/how the shape of ""each"" pattern matters or not though.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

I have also done some very introductory material in topology, sort of covered a typical ""intro to topology"" book. What I was wanting to ask about was the connections between the two. Now I know that there are many strong connections, but I am yet to actually come across any of these connections (apart from reading things which says they exists and hearing people talk about these connections very generally). So I was wondering if anyone could give me some idea as to where the connections lie and some references for reading about this. I am aware that there is something called ""o-minimality"" but I have no idea what this is, so I was looking for some good references. Also as I stated above I have an introductory grasp on topology so is it the case that I need to learn much more before I can grasp these connections at all? (I would also like to add that I am not really sure what I am asking about, as I'm sure is obvious from the question, so please feel free to tell me that I'm looking for the wrong things or my questions is too naive.) As always any help is greatly appreciated.","['general-topology', 'model-theory', 'reference-request', 'soft-question']"

262701,How to obtain (prove) 5-stencil formula for 2nd derivative?,"My question seems pretty easy. Prove the correctness of the following approximation: $$f(x)''= \frac{-f(x-2h)+16f(x-h)-30f(x)+16f(x-h)-f(x+2h)}{12h^2}$$ I rendered myself deeply saddened upon stumbling on this and being seemingly unable solve it by my own. I also failed to find proof anywhere online. Only final answer. The way I tried to it is via pretty common Taylor series expansion: $$f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h+\frac{1}{2!}f''(x)h^2+\frac{1}{3!}f^{(3)}(x)h^3 + \sum_{n=4}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}f^{(n)}(x)h^n\quad (1)$$ I cut it off after $f^{(3)}$. I use this formula to get rest of the points to have 5-stencils, simply by substituting $h$ with $\{-h; 2h; -2h\}$ Thus I get: $$f(x-h) = f(x) - f'(x)h+\frac{1}{2!}f''(x)h^2-\frac{1}{3!}f^{(3)}(x)h^3\quad (2)$$ 
$$f(x+2h) = f(x) + 2f'(x)h+\frac{4}{2!}f''(x)h^2+\frac{8}{3!}f^{(3)}(x)h^3\quad (3)$$
$$f(x-2h) = f(x) - 2f'(x)h+\frac{4}{2!}f''(x)h^2-\frac{8}{3!}f^{(3)}(x)h^3\quad (4)$$ When I use equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, and add them by sides, I can get the 3-point formula: $$f(x+h) + f(x-h) = 2f(x) + f''(x)h^2\quad (5)$$ $$f''(x) = \frac{f(x-h) - f(2x) + f(x+h)}{h^2}$$ However when I try to do this with all the equations $(1)$-$(4)$ I get: $$f(x+h) + f(x-h) = 2f(x) + f''(x)h^2 \quad (6)$$ $$f(x+2h) + f(x-2h) = 2f(x) +4f''(x)h^2\quad (7)$$ Then I can try subtracting $(6)$ from $(7)$ and I get: $$f(x+h) + f(x-h) - f(x+2h) - f(x-2h) = 3 f''(x)h^2\quad (8)$$ which gives $$f''(x) = \frac{f(x+h) + f(x-h) - f(x+2h) - f(x-2h) } {3 h^2} \quad(9)$$ This is clearly different from what I am expecting. Also doing $(6)$+$(7)$ doesn't seem to yield correct coefficients, even though it preserves $f(x)$ term. Could you point out flaw in the approach and provide correct reasoning or any materials?

It's fairly evident, using symmetry, to find that there are 2 pairs of kite's edges (is geodesic the correct term?) which have equal length (blue and red above). Similarly two of the angles ($\beta$) are the same. It's easy to find $P$ and $Q$ given $R$ and the square's edge-length, but how does one find the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given $P$ and $Q$ ? (I assume $\gamma=\frac{\pi}{4}$ because the square touches the sphere at the bottom right vertex). This originated from a question about the red kite's area (easy to get is you know $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$), but whilst I'm interested how to find $P$ and $Q$ now for its own sake, is there a more direct way that only involves $P$ and $Q$ to find the area (this is not the same as a formula that only involves $P$, $Q$ and the area but whose derivation requires $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$)?

Assume $Q$ is not true, and $P$ is true. Blabla, but this implies $P$ is not true, which is a contradiction. When I want to prove the contrapositive, I say. Assume $Q$ is not true. Blabla, this implies $P$ is not true. The only difference in the proof is that I assume $P$ is true in the beginning, when I want to prove by contradiction. But this feels almost redundant, as in the end I always get that this is not true. The only other way that I could get a contradiction is by proving that $Q$ is true.
