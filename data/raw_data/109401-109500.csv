1576681,Is a factorial-primorial mesh divisible by the factorial infinitely often?,"Question Suppose the factorial and primorial functions conceived a baby through the act of addition and called it $n!\#$, and it looked like this: $$n!\# = \prod_{i=1}^n (p_i + i) = (2 + 1)(3 + 2)(5 + 3)(7 + 4) \dots (p_n + n)$$ Does it happen infinitely often that the factorial divides this function, i.e. are there infinite integer solutions to: $$\dfrac{n!\#}{n!}$$ Background The factorial function $n!$ is well known and is given by: $$\prod_{i=1}^n i = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \dots n$$ The marginally less well known primorial function $p_n\#$ is given by: $$\prod_{i=1}^n p_i = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times \dots p_n$$ where $p_i$ is the $i^{th}$ prime. The function defined above is catalogued in the OEIS under the following link: OEIS reference . However there is no reference to divisibility by $n!$ there. What I know so far Here are the first few values I've computed for $n!\#$: $\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
n & n! & n!\# & \textrm{divides?} \\ 
\hline
1 & 1 & 3 & \textrm{Yes} \\ 
2 & 2 & 15 & \textrm{No} \\ 
3 & 6 & 120 & \textrm{Yes}\\ 
4 & 24 & 1320 & \textrm{Yes} \\
5 & 120 & 21120 & \textrm{Yes} \\
6 & 720 & 401280 & \textrm{No} \\
7 & 5040 & 9630720 & \textrm{No} \\
\end{array}$ My Intuition I'm of two minds as to the truth of this statement, and I don't have enough experience with numbers to judge either way, so I'm on the fence for now. Here are my two basic arguments, which are far from rigorous. Argument for: The primes are randomly scattered, whereas the sequence $1, 2, 3, \dots, n$ isn't. So adding $p_n + n$ should preserve the randomness that was there in the primes in the first place. By randomness, I mean there should be no preference shown for particular prime factors over others. Now, since $n\#!$ grows much faster than $n!$, it should eventually start sweeping up all the primes in $n!$. Perhaps there is even some $N$ such that that divisibility of $n!\#$ by $n!$ is true for all $n > N$, but this is quite strong and I'm not so sure. Argument against: On the other hand, what throws doubt on the conjecture is that because $n\#!$ grows so fast, perhaps it grows too fast, and misses lots of little primes that are bundling up in $n!$. In other words, perhaps there is a point $N$ such that that divisibility of $n!\#$ by $n!$ is false for all $n > N$.",['number-theory']

1576708,A function of two cumulative probability distributions with same first 2 moments,"Let $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$ be cumulative probability distribution functions with domain $[L, \infty)$, $L\geq 0$, both distributions having the same expectation $\mu$ and the same second moment (hence finite second moment, $\textbf{a modification and added constraint to the earlier post}$), and the kurtosis of the distribution behind $\Phi_2$ is higher than that of $\Phi_1$ (new constraint). Looking for whether $G'-G \geq 0$ $, with $$G=1-\frac{1}{\mu}\int_L^\infty \left(1- \Phi_1(x)\right)^2 \, \mathrm{d} x$$ $$G'=1-\frac{1}{\mu}\int_L^\infty \left(1- \frac{1}{2}\left(\Phi_1(x)+\Phi_2(x)\right)\right)^2 \, \mathrm{d} x$$ $\textbf{Approach: }$
Consider a square integrable function $s(x):[L,\infty) \rightarrow (-1,1)$, as a difference, with
$\Phi_2(x)=\Phi_1(x) + s(x)$. $$G'-G=\frac{1}{\mu}\left(\int_L^{\infty } s(x) \, dx- \int_L^{\infty } s(x) \Phi (x) \, dx-\frac{1}{4}\int_L^{\infty } s(x)^2 \, dx\right) $$ It looks like we have $\int_L^\infty s(x) \, dx=0$ and  $\int_L^\infty x \, s(x) \, dx=0$, since both distributions have the same first two moments and are in the positive domain, and integrating by parts  we get $ \int_L^\infty \left(1-\Phi(x)\right) \, dx= \int_L^\infty \left(1-\Phi(x)-s(x)\right) \, dx$, and  $ \int_L^\infty x \left(1-\Phi(x)\right) \, dx= \int_L^\infty x \left(1-\Phi(x)-s(x)\right) \, dx.$ What are the bounds on $G'-G$? Are there calculation mistakes in the above? We also have $s(L)=s(\infty)=0, s(x)\leq 1-\Phi_1(x)$. By Cauchy-Schwarz, we also get $\left(\int s(x) \Phi (x)\right)^2 \leq \int s(x)^2  \int \Phi (x)^2$, but I can't see where this can be useful.","['probability-theory', 'integral-inequality', 'probability-distributions', 'statistics', 'integration']"

1576804,Tangent Space to Grassmannian,"I have a second question today. In Harris' ""Algebraic Geometry: A First course"" he constructs (on page 200) an isomorphism between the tangent space of the Grassmannians and some homomorphisms: He begins with the cover of the Grassmannians defined in Section 6, i.e. for a (n-k)-plane $\Gamma \subset K^{n+1}$ he defines $U_{\Gamma}:= \{\Lambda'\in\mathbb G(k,n)|\ \Lambda \cap \Gamma=(0)\}$. Then he constructs an isomorphism to $\mathbb A^{(n-k)(k+1)}$ as follows: ""Fixing a subspace $\Lambda\in U_{\Gamma}$ a subspace $\Lambda' \in U_{\Gamma}$ is the graph of a homomorphism $\phi:\Lambda\rightarrow\Gamma$, so that
                       $U_{\Gamma}=$Hom$(\Lambda, \Gamma)$. He then deduces $T_{\Lambda}(\mathbb G)=$Hom$(\Lambda, \Gamma)$. This last step is not trivial for me so I tried to cut it up in several substeps, but I seem to be stuck: We know by one definition of the projective tangent space at some point $p$ of some projective variety $X\subset \mathbb P^n$ that it is the projective closure of the affine tangent space of $X\cap U$, where $p\in U$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb A^n$. Now for $\Lambda \in \mathbb G$ there exists such an open subset $\Lambda \in U\subset \mathbb P^{\binom{n+1}{k+1}}$ such that $\mathbb G\cap U=U_{\Gamma}$ for some $\Gamma$. Then by the fact above, we know $T_{\Lambda}(\mathbb G)=\bar{T_{\Lambda}(U_{\Gamma})}=\bar{U_{\Gamma}}$, as $U_{\Gamma}$ is affine (the bars are supposed to denote the projective closure). How do I continue? I know that $U_{\Gamma}=$Hom$(\Lambda, \Gamma)$ but don't I need $\bar{U_{\Gamma}}=$Hom$(\Lambda, \Gamma)$? Thank you very much!","['projective-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry']"

There may, of course, be many such points (maybe $f$ is constant!) But I'd still like to show that some ""equivariant"" point is stable in the following sense. We start with a map $\varphi: X \times S^n \to \Bbb R^n$, $X$ some compact manifold. We think of this as a continuously varying family of maps $\varphi_x: S^n \to \Bbb R^n$, given by $\varphi_x(p) = \varphi(x,p)$. The Borsuk-Ulam theorem guarantees there is some point $p_x$ with $\varphi_x(p_x) = \varphi_x(-p_x)$.

(This should be called stability of the equivariant point because given a map $\varphi_x$, under a mild perturbation of $\varphi_x$, we may still find two equivariant points that are close to one another.) Said another way, given a continuous family of maps $S^n \to \Bbb R^n$, can I continuously choose an equivariant point? It would be good to prove this at first for $X = I$.

1577105,How does one in general analyze the convergence of the following series?,"The following question is inspired in the following videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL43B1963F261E6E47 Say one has a general second order linear differential equation $y''+Qy=0$ for some functions $y,Q:U\subseteq\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with the initial condition $y(0)=a$ and $y'(0)=b$. Replace the equation by $y''+\epsilon Qy=0$ for $\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}$. Assume the solution is of the form $y(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}y_n(x)\epsilon^n$ for some functions $y_1,\dots,y_n:U\subseteq\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$. Then plugging in one finds:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}y''_n\epsilon^n+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}Qy_n\epsilon^{n+1}=y_0''+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(y_n''+Qy_{n-1}\right)\epsilon^n=0$$
Therefore, if we let $y_0(x)=a+bx$ and $y_1(0)=\dots=y_n(0)=y_1'(0)=\dots=y_n'(0)=0$ the initial conditions are fulfilled. Finally, one needs to solve $y_n''+Qy_{n-1}=0$ which has the obvious thanks to the initial condition of $y_n(x)=-\int_0^x\int_0^{s_{2n-1}}Q(s_{2n-2})y_{n-1}(s_{2n-2})ds_{2n-2}ds_{2n-1}$. The close form for $y_n$ is
$$y_n(x)=(-1)^n\int_0^x\int_0^{s_{2n-1}}Q(s_{2n-2})\int_0^{s_{2n-2}}\int_0^{s_{2n-3}}Q(s_{2n-4})\dots\int_0^{s_{2}}\int_0^{s_1}Q(s_1)(a+s_0b)ds_0\dots ds_{2n-1} \\
=(-1)^n\int_0^x\int_0^{s_{2n-1}}\dots\int_0^{s_1}Q(s_{2n-2})Q(s_{2n-4})\dots Q(s_{0})(a+s_0b)ds_0\dots ds_{2n-1} \\
=(-1)^n\int\limits_{[0,s_1]\times\dots\times[0,s_{2n-1}]\times[0,x]}(a+bs_0)\prod_{\{m\in\mathbb{N}^{\leq2n-2}|\text{m is even}\}}Q(s_m)ds_0\dots ds_{2n-1}$$
and the general solution would be
$$y(x)=a+bx+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n\int\limits_{[0,s_1]\times\dots\times[0,s_{2n-1}]\times[0,x]}(a+bs_0)\prod_{\{m\in\mathbb{N}^{\leq2n-2}|\text{m is even}\}}Q(s_m)ds_0\dots ds_{2n-1}$$
Now, this solution does in fact work for $Q=0$ and $Q=1$ (in the latter the solution yields the taylor expansion of $\sin$ and $\cos$). Non the less, I am guessing that in most cases the solution diverges since otherwise it would be taught in any differential equations class.

\end{pmatrix}
$$ Where $S$ means sunny, $R$ means rainy and $F$ means foggy. For example $P(S \mid F)$ is the probability of being sunny tomorrow given that today is foggy. Similarly,  $P(R \mid R)$ is the probability of tomorrow being rainy if today is also rainy. The graph representing the situation would look like this Now suppose today is Monday and it's sunny. I would like to estimate the probabilities of a sunny Tuesday a sunny Tuesday and Wednesday a sunny Wednesday On Wikipedia there's a similar problem , but since I am new to these things, I decided to ask you help you anyway at least for some clarifications. As far as I have understood a Markov process is a memoryless stochastic process, that only remembers the current state in order to predict future states. For point $1$, we can simply use the fact that $P(S \mid S) = 0.5$, i.e. the probability of tomorrow being sunny if today is sunny is $0.5$, which is therefore the answer. For the other cases it's a little bit more complicated: we cannot use directly any value from the stochastic matrix $P$. We need of course to do intermediary calculations. The example I am linking to, to predict the weather on day $1$, it creates a vector representing the weather on day $0$. Similarly, in my case, I think that vector would be $$v_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ that is the $1$ represents that it's $100 \%$ sunny. If I multiply $v_1$ by $P$ I obtain (similarly to the Wikipedia's problem above) the following vector $$v_1 =\begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.3 \end{pmatrix}$$ From this to obtain my guess of $0.5$ there's some distance of reasoning. Could you please explain it to me How do you explain the $0.5$ I am guessing (if it's correct) from the calculations that I just did and done in the solutions to the Wikipedia's problem. If it's not correct, why and how can I solve it? In the third question, do I need to do the same thing as I did for the first point, but using $P^2$, like in the Wikipedia's article? The second question involves a compound probability (I think). Am I right? How exactly would I proceed to solve this case, and why?

1577150,Frattini subgroup of a finite elementary abelian $p$-group is trivial,"I would like to improve my proof of the following result: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. Here, $\Phi(H)$ is the Frattini subgroup, defined as the intersection of all maximal subgroups of $H$. An elementary abelian $p$-group is an abelian group with the property that $x^p = 1$ for all $x \in H$. I proved this by choosing an arbitrary nonidentity element $x \in H$ and showing that there exists a maximal subgroup $M < H$ which does not contain $x$. My proof explicitly constructs $M$. I wonder if there is a cleaner, more elegant way to establish the existence of $M$ without resorting to a construction . My proof: Let $x \in H$ be a nonidentity element. Define $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $|N_1| = p$. If $N_1 < H$, choose $x_2 \in H \setminus N_1$, and define $N_2 = \langle x_2\rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2$ is a subgroup, with $N_1 \cap N_2 = 1$, so $N_1 N_2$ is a direct product with order $p^2$. If $N_1 N_2 < H$, we continue in the same way. By step $k$ we start with a direct product $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ with order $p^{k-1}$. If this subgroup is proper, choose $x_k \in H \setminus N_1 N_2 \cdots N_{k-1}$ and define $N_k = \langle x_k \rangle$. Then $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_k$ is a direct product with order $p^k$. Since $H$ is finite, this process eventually terminates and we end up with $H = N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, where $N_1 = \langle x \rangle$. Then $M = N_2 \cdots N_m$ is a maximal subgroup of $H$ which does not contain $x$: Maximality is clear because the index of $N_2\cdots N_m$ is $p$. If $x \in N_2 \cdots N_m$ then we can write $x$ in two different ways in $N_1 N_2 \cdots N_m$, namely $(x)(1)\cdots(1) = (1)(n_2)\cdots(n_m)$. The uniqueness of representation in a direct product then forces $x = 1$. Context: This question addresses a remark made by Isaacs in Finite Group Theory , following problem 1.D.8: If $G$ is a finite $p$-group, then $\Phi(G)$ is the unique normal subgroup of $G$ minimal with the property that the factor group is elementary abelian. I proved this by establishing the following results: If $H$ is a finite, elementary abelian $p$-group, then $\Phi(H) = 1$. If $\theta : G \to H$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $\theta(\Phi(G)) \leq \Phi(H)$. Therefore, if $K \lhd G$ and $G/K$ is elementary abelian, then $\Phi(G) \leq K$.","['p-groups', 'alternative-proof', 'finite-groups', 'abelian-groups', 'group-theory']"

Performing the change of variables to polar coordinates $x=r\cos\phi$ , $y=r\sin\phi$ and after some trigonometric manipulations we result in $$\dot{r}=r^2(\cos^3\phi+\sin^3\phi)\\ \dot{\phi}=4+r\cos \phi \sin\phi(\cos \phi -\sin \phi )$$ From this set of equations I want to prove that if we start with sufficiently small $r$ then $r$ will remain bounded with very small variations over time. My intuitive approach: For very small $r$ $$\dot{\phi}\approx 4$$ that yields $$\phi(t)\approx 4t +\phi_0$$ If we replace in the $r$ dynamics we obtain $$\dot{r}\approx r^2\left[\cos^3(4t+\phi_0)+\sin^3(4t+\phi_0)\right]$$ Integrating over $[0,t]$ we obtain $$\frac{1}{r_0}-\frac{1}{r(t)}\approx \int_0^t{\left[\cos^3(4s+\phi_0)+\sin^3(4s+\phi_0)\right]ds}$$ The right hand side is a bounded function of time with absolute value bounded by $4\pi$ since $$\int_{t_0}^{t_0+2\pi}{\left[\cos^3(4s+\phi_0)+\sin^3(4s+\phi_0)\right]ds}=0 \quad \forall t_0$$ Thus for very small $r_0$ it holds true that $r(t)\approx r_0$ .

Again consider the group $G := PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ over some field $\mathbb F$. Then as written in the other post, there are two natural actions associated with $G$, one is by considering the points $\mathbb F^2$ and look at the induced action of $SL(2,\mathbb F)$ (as $PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ is just a quotient of $SL(2, \mathbb F)$), another by viewing $G$ as consisting of ""Möbius""-like maps of the form

where $ad - bc = 1$ (remark: you get the same set of mappings by just asserting that $ad - bc$ must be a square) and let them act on $\mathbb F_{\infty} = \mathbb F \cup \{\infty\}$ (the extended field, or the projective line). Now I want to show that both actions are equivalent, i.e. we have essentially the same actions by identifiying the points $\mathbb F^2$ with the projective line $\mathbb F_{\infty}$. I started to give such an indentification, and then started to compute if the actions are equivalent, I give all these computations. In case iv) and v) I got stuck. So I am asking if anybody could help me resolving these points? Now the computations: Given two actions of $G := PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ on two sets, $\Omega := \mathbb F^2$ and $\Gamma := \mathbb F_{\infty}$. Then an operation of a group $G$ on two sets $\Omega, \Gamma$ is called equivalent if there exists a bijection $\lambda : \Omega \to \Gamma$ such that
$$
 \lambda(\alpha^g) = \lambda(\alpha)^g
$$
for all $g \in G$. The bijection is $\lambda((x,y)^T) = x/y$ if $y \ne 1$ and $\lambda((x,0)^T) := \infty$ otherwise. An element of $g \in PSL(2,\mathbb F)$ is represented by four numbers $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb F$ such that $ad - bc = 1$. This could be viewed as a matrix modulo $\{I, -I\}$, or as a mapping as written at the beginning. So if $(x,y)^T \in \mathbb F^2$ we define the action by matrix multiplication, and for $x \in \mathbb F_{\infty}$ by applying the mapping. Now let $g \in PSL(2, \mathbb F)$ and let $a,b,c,d$ the corresponding numbers (up to a common constant). i) $y \ne 0, cx + dy \ne 0$ Then

 \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right) 
 & = \lambda\left( \begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{pmatrix} \right)
 = \frac{ax + by}{cx + dy}
 = \frac{a(x/y) + b}{c(x/y) + d} = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g.
\end{align*} ii) $y = 0, cx + dy \ne 0$. Then $x \ne 0$ and $c \ne 0$ is implied.
\begin{align*}
 \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right) 
 & = \lambda\left( \begin{pmatrix} ax \\ cx  \end{pmatrix} \right)
 = \frac{ax}{cx}
 = \frac{a}{c}
 = \infty^g
 = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g.
\end{align*} iii) $y = 0, cx + dy = 0, c = 0$. 
\begin{align*}
 \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right)
 = \infty
 = \infty^g
 = \lambda((x,y)^T)^g
\end{align*} iv) $y = 0, cx + dy = 0, c \ne 0$ Then we must have $x = 0$. Hence $\lambda((0,0)^g) = \lambda((0,0))$
and this should equal $\lambda((0,0))^g$, hence $\lambda((0,0))^g$
must be a fixed point of each $g$ with the above conditions. But I do not see what this fixed point should be? The only reasonable choice would be $\lambda((0,0)) = \infty$, but that does not works out as for $c \ne 0$
we have $\infty^g = a/c$. v) $y \ne 0, cx + dy = 0$. \begin{align*}
 \lambda\left(\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \right) = \infty 
\end{align*}
Here $\lambda((x,y)) = x/y$ and $(x/y)^g = (a(x/y) + b)/(c(x/y) + d)$, and this must equal $\infty$, but it does only if $y = 0$ (as then $\lambda((x,y)) = \infty)$ or $(-d/c)^g = \infty$ is also another value that gives $\infty$, but in general we do not have $x = -d, y = c$ in this situation. So how to go on? EDIT : With Derek's answer I am able to resolve my issues: iv) As this gives $x = 0, y = 0$ the argument does not desribe a line, therefore this case is excluded. v) Here $cx + dy = 0$ implies $\langle (x,y)^T \rangle = \langle (-d, c)^T \rangle$ if $(-d, c) \ne (0,0)$ (note $(-d,c) = (0,0)$ is not possible anyway). Now 
$$
\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle^g) = \lambda(\langle (ax + by,0)^T \rangle) = \infty.
$$
On the other side we have $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle) = \lambda(\langle (-d, c)^T \rangle) = -d/c$ if $c \ne 0$, and $\lambda(\langle (-d, c)^T\rangle) = \infty$ if $c = 0$. An now by convention $(-d/c)^g = \infty$ for $c \ne 0$
and $\infty^g = \infty$ (see wikipedia:Möbius transformation ). So that the equality asserted for equivalent actions holds. Now suppose $c = 0$, then by $ad - bc = 1$ we must have $d \ne 0$ and by convention $\infty^g = \infty$ then. Further as 
above $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle^g) = \infty$ and $\lambda(\langle (x,y)^T \rangle) = \infty = \infty^g$ the equation for equivalent actions hold. If $d = 0$, then $c \ne 0$ and $b \ne 0$, and $y \ne 0$ together with $cx + dy = 0$ implies $x = 0$. This gives
$$
 \lambda(\langle (0,y)^T \rangle^g)
 = \lambda(\langle (by, dy)^T \rangle)
 = \lambda(\langle (b, 0)^T \rangle)
 = \infty.
$$
On the other side $\lambda(\langle (0,y) \rangle) = 0$, so we must have $0^g = \infty$ if $d = 0$ and the argument ist $0$? I guess this would be natural convention by looking at the mapping side, as then $g$ would be the mapping
$$
 \frac{ax + b}{cx}
$$
and for $x = 0$ setting the value of this ""division by zero"" to $\infty$ might be a natural definition (anyway, the convention $0^g = \infty$ for $d = 0$ is included in $(-d/c)^g = \infty$).","['mobius-transformation', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'geometry', 'field-theory']"

This question was inspired by (and is a variation of) the following question and its answer . Let $f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a differentiable function such that $f(0)=0$ and $f'(x)>f(x)$ for all $x>0$. It could be shown then, as in the answer referred to above, 
that $f(x)>0$ for all $x>0$. The solution goes as follows (with some details added). Let $g(x)=e^{-x} f(x)$. Because $g'(x)=e^{-x}\Bigl(f'(x)-f(x\Bigr)>0$ we have that $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $(0,\infty)$. Since $g(0)=0$ we have $g(x)>0$ for all $x\in(0,\infty)$, hence $f(x)=e^x g(x)>0$ whenever $x\in(0,\infty)$. On close inspection this argument works even if we add to the assumptions the requirement that $f'(0)<0$. This seems contradictory, since then on one hand $f(x)>0$ for all $x>0$, but on the other hand $f(x)<0$ for all $x\in(0,\varepsilon)$, for some small enough $\varepsilon>0$. This contradiction only shows that no such $f$ exist that satisfy all these conditions (including 
$f'(0)<0$). 
Thus the following: Question .  For which $t\ge0$ does there exist an $f$ with $f'(0)=t$, 
and with $f(0)=0$, $f'(x)>f(x)$ for all $x>0$? Easily $t≥1$ works, e.g. $f(x)=e^{tx}−1$. I wonder if any $t<1$ might also work, in particular if $t=0$ works. I feel the solution may have something to do with the notion of blow up as understood in this answer , but I don't seem to be able to figure the details. Tried to get a modification of $e^{-\frac1{x^2}}$ but it only works on a bounded interval of positive reals, not on all of $(0,\infty)$. Thank you for your help. (I included tag integration only because I thought the answer may have also something to do with the average value of $f$ on any interval $[a,b]$, defined as $\frac1{b-a}\int_a^b f(x) dx$. In particular the average value of $f'(x)$ on $[0,b]$ is $\frac1b\int_0^b f'(x) dx=f(b)$.)","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'exponential-function', 'integration', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Can one prove that the abelian group $E(k)$ is non-torsion? Better yet, can one prove that $E(k) \otimes_\mathbb Z \mathbb Q$ is an infinite-dimensional $\mathbb Q$-vector space? It is very tempting here to try to use the Lefschetz principle, to try to reduce the situation to $k= \mathbb C$ where both statements are obvious. However I am not sure that one can actually apply the Lefschetz principle as it would require formulating the statements in the first-order theory of fields and I am unfortunately not much of a logician. At least one can say that if the field $k$ is uncountable then $E(k)$ is uncountable whereas $E(k)^{\text{tors}}$ is countable (so much is true over any field), so there is always a non-torsion point. However when the field $k$ is countable, there seems to me to be no ""trivial"" reason why $E(k)$ should have an element of infinite order.

(One can check that this is an outer measure and that $\mu^*$ agrees with $\mu$ on $\mathcal{A}$). I want to show now that if $\{A_n\}_{n \geq 1}$ is a sequence of increasing sets (not necessarily in $\mathcal{A}$) such that $A_n \nearrow A$, then $\mu^*(A_n) \nearrow \mu^*(A)$. I have this so far. By monotonicity of outer measure, $\mu^*(A_n) \leq \mu^*(A)$ for all $n$, hence $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mu^*(A_n) \leq \mu^*(A)$. It remains to show that
$\mu^*(A) \leq \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \mu^*(A_n)$. My rough idea is as follows. Fix any $\epsilon > 0$. We can pick a sequence of sets $\{G_i\}_{i \geq 1}$ in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $\mu^*(A_i) \geq \mu(G_i) - \epsilon/2^{i}$. If the $\{G_i\}$ were an increasing set then we'd be done by using the continuity of measure from below. However, they are not. But, we can define $H_n := \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} G_i$ which is an increasing sequence by definition. Since $A \subset \bigcup_{n \geq 1} H_n$, we have that

However, I failed to come up with a formal solution. Yesterday our TA provided the solution to the problem. Unfortunately, while I understand it intuitively to some degree I can't make it $100\%$ formal. Here's the solution: Let $\Omega = \{\textrm{all Cubes in $S^2$}\}$ and suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is the uniform distribution. We define $X_i(\omega) = 1$ , if vertex $i$ of $w$ is red and $X_i(\omega) = 0$ otherwise. Then $\sum_{i=1}^{8} X_i(\omega) = \textrm{Number of red vertices of $\omega$}$ . Now we have $E(X_i) = \frac{9}{10}\cdot1 + \frac{1}{10}\cdot 0 = \frac{9}{10}$ and thus $E(X) = E(\sum_{i=0}^{8}  X_i) = \sum_{i=0}^{8}  E(X_i) = 8\cdot\frac{9}{10} = 7.2 \implies \exists \omega \textrm{, such that } \sum_{i=1}^{8} X_i(\omega) = 8$ . My questions: It seems natural that $E(X_i) = \frac{9}{10}$ , but how do we arrive at this result and why is it a sum? Since $\Omega$ is uncountably infinite the expected value should be an integral of some kind, but $X_i$ isn't even continuous!

If this is true, then it would be true for the (I know it's not the exact) definition of a definite integral: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d}x =\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_i^*)\Delta x$$ So I just did a quick verification of a simple definite integral of $x^2$ from $0$ to $1$. Using the Riemann sum definition I got $1/3$ and switching the limits of integration I got $-1/3$ as expected. However, I noticed that if you take $\Delta x$ to always be positive, in the sense that it's a width of a rectangle and couldn't possibly be negative, then the answer either way would be $1/3$. Which, in conclusion, brings me back to my question: wouldn't it be simpler to take $\Delta x$ as a distance or width (always positive) and eliminate this property of integrals? Leaving us with: $$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \mathrm{d}x =\int_{b}^{a} f(x) \mathrm{d}x$$ To me this makes more sense, because the area under a curve should be maintained when calculated from any direction.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'area', 'riemann-sum']"

1577745,MISSISSIPPI with 2 constraints,"This is a post with two questions: The problem states: How many arrangements of MISSISSIPPI are there in which the first I precedes the first S and the first S precedes the first P. First answer and question: For the $S$'s the basic construction is: $$
I \wedge S \wedge P \wedge P \wedge,
$$ so there are 4 spaces where to put 3 $S$'s: $\binom{6}{3}$. For each arrangement of the $S$'s there are $8$ spaces where to fit $3$ $I$'s: $\binom{10}{3}$. Finally, for the $M$, there are 11 ways to put it. Answer: $\binom{6}{3}\binom{10}{3}\binom{11}{1}=26400$. Apparently this is wrong, is it? Second answer and question The basic construction is $$
\wedge I \wedge S \wedge P \wedge P \wedge,
$$ but here, the S's can occupy places $2-5$, $I$'s and the M can occupy all the places. (a) There's zero $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ is also in place $1$:
$1 \binom{6}{3}\frac{4!}{3!}$. (The first one is arrange the $S$'s, the arrange them in the allowed places, and the last term is to arrange $I$'s and the $M$ in the first place. (b) There's zero $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ is also in places $2-5$:
$\frac{4!}{3!} \binom{7}{4} 1$. (Again, the first term is to arrange the $S$'s and the $M$, then place them in the places $2-5$, the last term is the arrangement of $3$ identical I's. (c) $1$ $I$ in places $2-5$ and $M$ in place $1$: $\frac{4!}{3!}\binom{7}{4}\frac{3!}{2!}$ (d) $1$ $I$ in places $2-5$ and $M$ in places $2-5$: $\frac{5!}{3!}\binom{8}{5} 1$ (e) $2$ $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ in place $1$: $\frac{5!}{3!2!}\binom{8}{5} 2!$ (f) $2$ $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ in places $2-5$: $\frac{6!}{3!2!}\binom{9}{6}$ (g) $3$ $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ in place $1$: $\frac{6!}{3!3!}\binom{9}{6}$ (h) $3$ $I$'s in places $2-5$ and $M$ in places $2-5$: $\frac{7!}{3!3!}\binom{10}{7}$ Summing up all the cases I obtain the same number as my answer 1: $\binom{6}{3}\binom{10}{3}\binom{11}{1}$. Now, my second question is the following, is it wrong this last argument?
I don't know if I can save my answer because for example I think I have double counting in the following example (I placed in parenthesis the position of the letters that occupy an allowed space): $$
(M) I (SISI) S \wedge P (IS) P \wedge = \\
(M) I \wedge S (ISIS) P (IS) P \wedge

1577775,"Are the addition and multiplication of real numbers, as we know them, unique?","After recently concluding my Real Analysis course in this semester I got the following question bugging me: Is the canonical operation of addition on real numbers unique? Otherwise: Can we define another operation on Reals in a such way it has the same properties of usual addition and behaves exactly like that? Or even: How I can reliable know if there is no two different ways of summing real numbers? Naturally these dense questions led me to further investigations, like: The following properties are sufficient to fully characterize the canonical addition on Reals? Closure Associativity Commutativity Identity being 0 Unique inverse Multiplication distributes over If so, property 6 raises the question: Is the canonical multiplication on Reals unique? But then, if are them not unique, different additions are differently related with different multiplications? And so on... The motivation comes from the construction of real numbers. From Peano's Axioms and the set-theoretic definition of Natural numbers to Dedekind and Cauchy's construction of Real numbers we haven't talked about uniqueness of operations in classes nor I could find relevant discussion about this topic on the internet and in ubiquitous Real Analysis reference books by authors as: Walter Rudin Robert G.

1577847,"$f'(x)\geq 0$ only, but still strictly increasing","It is a quick corollary of the Mean Value Theorem that for a real differentiable function $f:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb R$ that if $f'(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ then $f$ is (weakly) increasing if $f'(x)>0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$ then $f$ is strictly increasing However, this result can be significantly strengthened. For example if $f'(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ and $Z(f')=\{x\in(a,b):f'(x)=0\}$ is a discrete subset of $(a,b)$, then $f$ is strictly increasing if $f'(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ and if the derived set of $Z(f')$ is discrete, then $f$ is strictly increasing This pattern continues. Given $A\subseteq\mathbb R$, let $A^{(0)}=A$ and $A^{(n+1)}=(A^{(n)})'$ where $E'$ denotes the derived set of $E$. We then have
this result: if $f'(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$ and $(Z(f'))^{(n)}$ is discrete for some $n$, then $f$ is strictly increasing (note that $Z(f')$ must be countable in this case) The next-simplest-yet-more-complicated example that I couldn't wrangle is when $Z(f')$ has an order type like $\omega^\omega+1$. Thus the question is Let $f'(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$ such that $Z(f')$ has order type $\omega^\omega+1$. Is $f$ necessarily strictly increasing on $(a,b)$? You may assume that $Z(f')$ is embedded as a closed subset of $(a,b)$ if necessary. The proof of the three claims before-hand rely heavily on two facts: Strictly increasing is a local property. That is, if $f:(a,b)\rightarrow\mathbb R$ such that for all $x\in (a,b)$ there is an $\varepsilon>0$ such that $f$ is strictly increasing on $(x-\varepsilon,x+\varepsilon)$ then $f$ is strictly increasing on $(a,b)$ if $f$ is strictly increasing on $(a,b)$ and extends continuously to $[a,b)$, then $f$ is strictly increasing on $[a,b)$. The dual statement is also true. When $Z(f')$ had order type $\omega+1$, the real question is what happens around the 'top' of $Z(f')$. When $Z(f')$ had order type $\omega^2+1$, the question is what happens around $Z(f')^{(1)}$. And so forth. This argument can be extended to deal with $A$ such that $A^{(n)}$ is discrete for some $n$. This wraps up a lot of sets which are order-isomorphic to countable ordinals. But with a set with order type $\omega^\omega+1$, we have that every element, except one (the 'bottom'), is an accumulation point. And I can not apply the induction I was using to prove the third claim.","['real-analysis', 'monotone-functions', 'calculus', 'order-theory', 'general-topology']"

1578034,"Which spaces can be used as ""test spaces"" for the Stone-Čech compactification?","Stone-Čech compactification $\beta X$ of a completely regular space $X$ is defined by the following property: Let $X$ be a completely regular space. Let $i \colon X \hookrightarrow \beta X$ be an embedding into a compact Hausdorff space $\beta X$. Then for every continuous map $f\colon X \to K$ where $K$ is a compact Hausdorff space there exists a unique continuous map $\widehat f \colon \beta X \to K$ such that $\widehat f \circ i =f$.  (In the other words, every continuous map $X\to K$ has a continuous extension $\beta X\to K$.) http://presheaf.com/?d=d4l86n4i40s4n18675m3rw6cye1p It is known that if we require the above property to be true not for all compact Hausdorff spaces $K$ but only for $K=[0,1]$, i.e. for the unit interval, then we get an equivalent definition. (One possible argument to show this is based on the fact that every compact Hausdorff space embeds into a power of the unit interval.) My question is: Which (compact Hausdorff) spaces $K$ has similar property as unit interval, i.e., the property that if we require the universal property from the definition of Stone-Čech compactification to hold only for this space $K$, then we obtain an equivalent definition? Is complete characterization known? Are these spaces precisely the generators of the reflective subcategory $\mathbf{CHaus}$ of the category $\mathbf{Top}$? Here $\mathbf{CHaus}$ denotes the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, $\mathbf{Top}$ is the category of topological spaces. By a generator of a reflective subcategory I mean a space such that its reflective hull is precisely this subcategory. For example, this is true if we take the unit circle $S$, simply because $[0,1]$ is a closed subspace of $S$. If we take $K=\{0,1\}$ with the discrete topology, then we cannot repeat the same argument as for unit interval. (Not every compact space, is a subspace of some power $\{0,1\}^a$.) So the above is probably not true for $K=\{0.1\}$","['category-theory', 'general-topology', 'compactness']"
1578062,Limsup of a probability,"I've encountered the following questions. Suppose  $X_n \rightarrow X$ in distribution, and $a<b$ Prove that
$$ P( a \le X\le b) \ge \limsup_{n\to \infty}P(a\le X_n\le b)   $$ I know how to find the limsup of a r.v, but i'm confused on the concept of limsup of a probability. My idea of approaching this problem is that, we can consider the event of $X$ being within $[a,b]$, and if we can prove that the $\lim\sup$ of this event is a subset of the event itself, the inequality would hold, but I'm worried if I'm mixing the idea of $\lim\sup$ of event and $\lim\sup$ of random variable. Would someone be so kind to give me some hint?","['weak-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'limsup-and-liminf']"

Let's suppose $\psi$ is a function of $x$, and if $\psi(x)>0$ then $\psi''(x)>0$. Similarly, if $\psi(x)<0$ then $\psi''(x)<0$.
A positive derivative indicates an increasing rate of change (convex up and local minima exists) and a negative derivative indicates a decreasing rate of change(concave down and local maxima exists) but why isn't the function able to start and end at $x=0$?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
