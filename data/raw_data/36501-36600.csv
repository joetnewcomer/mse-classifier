351854,To find Area of rectangular with given 3 parameters,"$a,b,c$ are given parameters . I would like to find Area of (ABCD) rectangular. I can find $d$ from $a,b,c$. $$(x-m)^2+(y-n)^2=a^2$$
$$(x-m)^2+n^2=b^2$$
$$m^2+(y-n)^2=c^2$$
$$m^2+n^2=d^2$$ $$m^2+n^2+(x-m)^2+(y-n)^2=a^2+d^2=b^2+c^2$$ $$d=\sqrt {b^2+c^2-a^2}$$ Let's define $\angle AEB =\alpha$,
$\angle DEC =\beta$ ,$\angle AED =\gamma$ , $\angle BEC =\phi$ $$x^2=a^2+c^2-2ac \cos (\alpha)$$
$$x^2=b^2+d^2-2bd \cos (\beta)$$
$$y^2=c^2+d^2-2cd \cos (\gamma)$$
$$y^2=a^2+b^2-2ab \cos (\phi)$$ $$b^2+d^2-2bd \cos (\beta)=a^2+c^2-2ac \cos (\alpha)$$
$$a^2+b^2-2ab \cos (\phi)=c^2+d^2-2cd \cos (\gamma)$$ And also we know that $$\alpha + \beta + \phi + \gamma = 2 \pi $$
$$\cos (\alpha + \beta + \phi + \gamma)= \cos (2 \pi)=1$$ Area of $ABCD =\frac{1}{2} [ac \sin (\alpha) + bd \sin (\beta) + cd \sin (\gamma))+ ab \sin (\phi)]=xy$ I am stuck to solve the equations and find the area by given $a,b,c$, Is it possible to find area of ABCD rectangular via given 3 parameters $a,b,c$ ? 
Thanks for hints and answers. UPDATE: Nov, 14th 2014: I proved that Area of ABCD does not depend on only $a,b,c$ $$y=a.\sin P +b \sin Q$$ $$|EF|=a \cos P=b \cos Q$$ $$x=a.\cos P +\sqrt{c^2-a^2 \sin^2 P}$$ $$y=a.\sin P +b \sin Q=a.\sin P +b \sqrt{1-\frac{a^2 \cos^2 P}{b^2}}$$ $$y=a.\sin P +b \sin Q=a.\sin P + \sqrt{b^2-a^2 \cos^2 P}$$ Area of $ABCD=x.y=(a.\cos P +\sqrt{c^2-a^2 \sin^2 P})(a.\sin P + \sqrt{b^2-a^2 \cos^2 P})$ The formula shows that The Area also depends on an angle not only $a,b,c$",['geometry']

351889,Isomorphisms of inner-product spaces,"I think I understand why all finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field $\mathbb{K}$ are isomorphic to $\mathbb{K}^n$. Any linear map $T: V \rightarrow W$ between finite-dimensional vector spaces taking a basis to a basis is automatically an isomorphism, by linearity. (c.f. this nice post .) But I'm puzzled about the following. On the one hand, there's $\mathbb{R}^n$ with standard basis $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and the natural Euclidean inner-product $$\langle \bar{x},\bar{y}\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i$$ On the other hand, there's $P_n([-1,1])$, the space of real polynomials on $[-1,1]$ of degree less than $n$, with the obvious basis $\{1,x,x^2,...,x^{n-1}\}$ and the $L^2$ inner-product $$\langle p,q\rangle = \int_{-1}^{-1} p(x)q(x)dx$$ They're both Hilbert spaces. The basis given for the former is orthonormal; the latter is not (but we can apply Gram-Schmidt to build the Legendre polynomials, which are.) This seems somehow strange to me: the $L^2$ inner-product looks like the most straightforward generalization of the Euclidean inner-product to function spaces, and the basis of monomials seems like the most natural basis of $P_n$ corresponding to the standard basis on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The Legendre polynomials, by contrast, appear bizarre and complicated. The vector spaces are obviously isomorphic: given any basis of each, we can easily construct an isomorphism $T$ mapping each basis to the other. But in the above example, orthonormality isn't preserved. If I want to keep orthonormality, it seems I have to choose: if I want the $L^2$ inner-product on $P_n([-1,1])$, I have to map $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to the Legendre polynomials. If I want the monomial basis $\{1,x,x^2,...,x^{n-1}\}$, I have to pick a different inner-product. I can't have my cake and eat it, too. (And I don't even know if an inner-product on $P_n$ exists for which the basis of monomials is orthonormal.) This leads me to several questions. For isomorphic, finite-dimensional vector spaces V and W, just how many isomorphisms are there? How many distinct inner-products can there be? Is there some sort of 'natural' correspondence here between isomorphisms and pairs of inner-products? (This was just confusion on my part.) Suppose I specify an inner-product and an orthonormal basis for $V$, and I map that to a basis for $W$. Is there an inner-product on $W$ such that this latter basis is orthonormal in $W$? More generally, is there an inner-product on $W$ that acts the same on $W$ as the inner-product on $V$ acts on $V$? I have a feeling that I'm confused about some pretty fundamental things here.","['inner-products', 'linear-algebra', 'orthogonal-polynomials', 'hilbert-spaces', 'orthonormal']"

351894,Rational map from a smooth surface,"I know that a rational map $f$ from a smooth variety $X$ to a projective variety $Y$ must be defined away from a set of codimension at least 2. So if $X$ is a surface, it is defined everywhere but finitely many points. I know that the inverse of a blowup provides an example of a rational map between surfaces which fails to be defined everywhere. My question is, what if $X$ is a surface, but the image of $f$ is one-dimensional? Then can we conclude that $f$ is defined everywhere?",['algebraic-geometry']
351905,Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality for Integrals for any two functions clarification,"I'm trying to work through a homework set, and it states that for any two functions, $f$ and $g$, that the following inequality holds: $$
\int{fg} \le ||f|| \cdot ||g|| \le \frac{c}{2}||f||^2 + \frac{1}{2c}||g||^2
$$ I am confused as to how to actually utilize this inequality.  First, what does it mean to say that the integral of a product of two functions is less than a weighted sum of the squares of their individual 2-norms?  I think my confusion stems in large part to the LHS of the above equation being an indefinite integral. Let's say that $f = f(x)$ and $g = g(x)$.  For integration between bounds $[a, b]$, is the below use the correct way to apply the inequality? \begin{align} 
\int_a^b f(x)g(x) dx \le \sqrt{f^2(b) - f^2(a)}\cdot\sqrt{g^2(b) - g^2(a)} \ ...
\\ \le \frac{c}{2}(f^2(b)-f^2(a)) + \frac{1}{2c}(g^2(b)-g^2(a))
\end{align} I'm at a step in my assignment, which I believe requires me to use this inequality, but I am not sure how I should apply the inequality when given a definite integral that is the product of two functions.  Is my understanding of the application misguided here?","['inequality', 'integration']"
351913,Probability that a stick randomly broken in five places can form a tetrahedron,"Edit (June. 2015) This question has been moved to MathOverflow, where a recent write-up finds a similar approximation as leonbloy's post below; see here . Randomly break a stick in five places. Question: What is the probability that the resulting six pieces can form a tetrahedron? Clearly satisfying the triangle inequality on each face is a necessary but not sufficient condition; an example is provided below. Furthermore, another commenter kindly points to a reference that may be of help in resolving this problem. In particular, it relates the question of when six numbers can be edges of a tetrahedron to a certain $5 \times 5$ determinant. Finally, a third commenter points out that since one such construction is possible, there is an admissible neighborhood around this arrangement, so that the probability is in fact positive. In any event, this problem is far harder than the classic $2D$ ""form a triangle"" one. Several numerical attacks can be found below; I will be grateful if anyone can provide an exact solution.","['geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'problem-solving']"

351933,Positive functions with zero integrals,"I was a bit confused by this link mentioned in this question - in particular, in Remark 4.21 in Theories of Integration by Kurtz and Swarz: Suppose that $f$ is a positive function on $[a,b]$. If $f$ is Henstock-Kurzweil integrable, then the best we can conclude is that $\int_a^bf\geq 0$; from our results so far we cannot conclude that the integral is positive. The Riemann integral has the same defect. The latter part of the statement is something that is not very clear to me. For any non-negative Lebesgue measurable function $f:[a,b]\to\Bbb R_+$ it holds that if $\lambda\{f>0\}>0$ then 
$$
  \int_{[a,b]} f\mathrm d\lambda >0
$$ 
where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure and the integral is the Lebesgue one. As a result, if there is a function $f:[a,b]\to\Bbb R_+$ such that $f(x)>0$ for any $x\in [a,b]$, but $\int_a^bf = 0$ (whatever way the latter integral is defined) then $f$ is either non-measurable, or the latter integral is such that
$$
  \int_a^b f\neq \int_{[a,b]}f\mathrm d\lambda.
$$
So my question is: is there a positive function on $[a,b]$ such that $\int_a^b f = 0$ for some (commonly known) definition of integral. In particular, does Remark 4.21 above mean that such example exists for the Riemann integral?","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'integration']"

352021,Finding a more direct way to reach $\mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = \sigma^2$,"Let $X_i$ be independent random variables, $\forall\,i \in \mathbf{n} \equiv \{0,\dots,n-1\}$, with identical expectation value $\mathbb{E}(X_i)=\mu$, and identical variance $\mathrm{Var}(X_i)=\sigma^2$. 1 Also, let $\overline{X}$ be their average, $\frac{1}{n}\sum X_i$ (where the summation for all $i\in \mathbf{n}$ is implicit, a convention I'll use throughout). It is not hard to show, by direct (if slightly tedious) calculation, that $$
\textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = \sigma^2
$$ Whenever I arrive at a very ""simple"" result through a ""tedious"" derivation, as in this case, I get the strong suspicion that there has to be a more direct, and yet entirely rigorous, reasoning to reach it.  Or rather, a way to view the problem that makes the result immediately ""obvious"". 2 In this case, the best I have found goes something like this: the above result follows  from the fact that, first, $$
\textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) = n \sigma^2
$$ and, second, if we subtract $\overline{X}$ instead of $\mu$, we have ""lost one degree of freedom"" , and ""therefore"" $$
\textstyle \mathbb{E}  \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) = (n - 1) \sigma^2
$$ I find this hand-wavy argument thoroughly unconvincing.  (I doubt that those who propose it would believe it if they didn't already know the result from a more rigorous derivation.) Is there something better? EDIT: Here's an example of the kind of argument I'm looking for.  It still has too many gaps to be satisfactory, but at least it shows a reasoning that does not require pencil and paper : it could be delivered orally, or with crude ""marks in the sand"" (no algebra), and be readily understood. First we can see that $$
\textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) \geq \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right)
$$ Why?  Because, the value of $c$ that minimizes $\sum (X_i - c)^2$ is $c = \overline{X}$ (a fact for which I could give a similarly hand-wavy, not-entirely-watertight argument, though easy to prove by tedious computation), which means that whenever $\overline{X} \neq \mu$, we would have $\sum (X_i - \mu)^2 > \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2$. Now, what ""drives"" $\overline{X}$ away from $\mu$ (so to speak) is $\sigma^2$.  So we can conclude that the difference $$
\textstyle \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right) \geq 0
$$ should increase monotonically as $\sigma^2$ increases... Fair enough, but why is the difference exactly $\sigma^2$, and not, say, $\sigma^2/n$, or *gasp* $\pi \sigma^2/n$?  Here my hand-waving begins to run out of steam...  It is suggestive that $\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}) = \mu$ and $$\mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} =
\mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mathbb{E}(\overline{X}))^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ Therefore it is tempting to surmise that, since, for each $i$, $(X_i - \mu) - (X_i - \overline{X}) = \overline{X} - \mu$, then each term $(X_i - \mu)^2 - (X_i - \overline{X})^2$ would contribute, ""on average"", $\mathbb{E}\left( ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right) = \sigma^2/n$ to the total difference.  This would require justifying the tantalizingly Pythagorean-looking equality: $$\mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \mu )^2 \right) = \mathbb{E} \left( ( X_i - \overline{X})^2 + ( \overline{X} - \mu )^2 \right)$$ ...though I readily concede that this is beginning to look as tedious as any algebraic computation. (I note that in this argument I did not use the fact that in this case $\mathrm{Var}(\sum X_i)=\sum\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$, which is surely the way forward.) 1 The typically given condition is to say that the $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed , but, AFAICT, the last condition is stronger than necessary.  For that matter, as Dilip Sarwate pointed out, the independence condition is also stronger than needed.  It is sufficient that $\mathrm{Var}(\sum X_i)=\sum\mathrm{Var}(X_i)$. 2 The ""scare quotes"" around ""simple"", ""tedious"", and ""obvious"" aim to convey the concession that these terms are all, of course, in the eye of the beholder.  So ""simplicity"" is shorthand for subjective simplicity or perceived simplicity , etc.  Also in the eye of the beholder is how much (perceived) tedium seems too much relative to the (perceived) simplicity.  If the difference $\mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \mu)^2 \right) - \mathbb{E} \left( \sum (X_i - \overline{X})^2 \right)$ had been, say, $\sigma^2/\sqrt{\pi}$, I would not have perceived the standard algebraic derivation as particularly tedious, because $\sigma^2/\sqrt{\pi}$ does not seem to me particularly simple.","['statistics', 'probability']"

Now I am in a trouble because I have the minimax theorem which holds for compact sets for the existence of a unique solution. According to Von Neumann's minimax theorem, I have
$$\max_{x\in X} \min_{y\in Y}f(x,y)=\min_{y\in Y} \max_{x\in X} f(x,y)$$
for some compact sets $X$ and $Y$ in my problem $X={\cal{F}}$ and $Y=\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the set of all decision rules $\delta\in\Delta$. However In this paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.2926.pdf with a slight difference, where $X$ is constructed by means of KL-divergence instead of squared Hellinger distance, it is claimed that there exists a unique solution for Von Neumann's minimax theorem! His argument for the compactness of $\Delta$ was that it satisfies infinity norm. However $y^2/(y^2+1)$ as an example given by @did shows that the maximum does not exist. Now I want to get something working but all I get is something not working. My second question : What minimal assumptions I can have such that X and Y are compact 
 sets or at least one of them is compact. Normally whenever I get some nominal density $f$ and construct ${\cal{F}}$, and choose a decision function $\delta$ for the minimization, the solution is unique. However I have mathematically either incorrect or incomplete expressions if I try to type the things as I observe. I would really appreciate your help in this matter. Thank you very much.","['convergence-divergence', 'nonlinear-optimization', 'uniform-convergence', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

I think I've done the work correctly, but I end up having an extra factor of $2\pi i$ at the end (this is from Stein and Shakarchi's book and they list the answer for this particular problem). So, my work is \begin{align}
e^z-1&=e^{z/2}\left(e^{z/2}-e^{-z/2}\right)\\ \\

\end{equation} Prove that: a) $P\{X_{n}=1 \; \text{for some} \; n\} = 1$ b) $P\{X_{n}=1 \; \text{infinitely often}\} = 1$ Part a) can be solved by conditioning on all possible realizations of $X_{n-1},\dots, X_{1}$ and using and inductive argument. For part b) it seem easier to prove that the complement of the desired event occurs with probability 0. I have two questions regarding this approach: 1) What is the complement of the event described in b)?, to me it would be the event of $X$ not occurring infinitely often, i.e., $\{\forall n\geq k, \;X_{n}=0 \}$. My confusion arises since it has been suggested to me that the complement is $\{X_{n}=1$ except for a finite number of indices $\}$, which is equivalent to $\{X_{n}=1, \forall n \geq k\}$ 2) In any case, the solution of b) revolves around finding the probability of a realization of the sequence $X_{k}, X_{k+1}, \dots$ given the sequence $X_{k-1}, X_{k-2}, \dots, X_{1}$. I need some suggestions about how to proceed here. Any help would be great.","['elementary-set-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

352501,A group of order $30$ has a normal $5$-Sylow subgroup.,"There are several things that confuse me about this proof, so I was wondering if anybody could clarify them for me. Lemma Let $G$ be a group of order $30$ . Then the $5$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ is
normal. Proof We argue by contradiction. Let $P_5$ be a $5$ -Sylow subgroup of $G$ . Then the
number of conjugates of $P_5$ is congruent to $1 \bmod 5$ and divides $6$ . Thus, there must be six conjugates of $P_5$ . Since the number of conjugates is the index of the normalizer, we see that $N_G(P_5) = P_5$ . Why does the fact that the order of $N_G(P_5)$ is 5 mean that it is equal to $P_5$ ? Since the $5$ -Sylow subgroups of $G$ have order $5$ , any two of them intersect in the
identity element only. Thus, there are $6\cdot4 = 24$ elements in $G$ of order $5$ . This leaves $6$ elements whose order does not equal $5$ . We claim now that the $3$ -Sylow subgroup, $P_3$ , must be normal in $G$ . The number of conjugates of $P_3$ is congruent to $1 \bmod 3$ and divides $10$ . Thus, if $P_3$ is not normal, it must have $10$ conjugates. But this would give $20$ elements of order $3$ when there cannot be more than $6$ elements of order unequal to $5$ so that $P_3$ must indeed be normal. But then $P_5$ normalizes $P_3$ , and hence $P_5P_3$ is a subgroup of $G$ . Moreover, the Second Noether Theorem gives $(P_5P_3)/P_3 \cong P_5/(P_5 \cap P_3)$ . But since $|P_5|$ and $|P_3|$ are relatively prime, $P_5 \cap P_3 = 1$ , and hence $P_5P_3$ must have order $15$ . Why do we need to use the second Noether theorem? Why can't we just use the formula $\frac{|P_5||P_3|}{|P_3 \cap P_5|}$ to compute the order? Thus, $P_5P_3 \cong Z_{15}$ , by Corollary $5.3.17$ . But then $P_5P_3$ normalizes $P_5$ , which contradicts the earlier statement that $N_G(P_5)$ has order $5$ . Why do we have to realize that $P_5P_3$ is isomorphic to $Z_{15}$ ? Also, how can we conclude that $P_5P_3$ normalizes $P_5$ ? Thanks in advance.","['sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

352554,Harris' AG ex 2.24: projective variety under regular map.,"I am trying to show that if $X$ is an irreducible projective variety, its graph under a regular map into projective space is an irreducible subvariety [Harris Ex 2.24]. I tried to modify a proof I gave before for the affine case. If $X\subset P^n$ is a projective variety, it is the vanishing set of some homogenous polynomials $G_j$ in $n+1$ variables. The regular map $\phi: X \rightarrow P^m$ is of the form $[\phi_0([X_0:\ldots:X_n]):\ldots: \phi_m([X_0:\ldots:X_n])]$, where each $\phi_i$ is regular on $X$. Call the graph of regular map $\phi$,  $\Gamma= \{[x:\phi(x)]:x\in X\} \subset P^n\times P^m$. To show that this graph is a variety, we can exhibit a set of polynomials who zero-locus is $\Gamma$. Consider the set of polynomials $S = \{G_j\} \cup \{ x_{n+i}-\phi_i\}$ where $i=0,\ldots, m$ and its vanishing set $V(S)$. First we show $\Gamma \subset V(S)$. Take some element $[x:\phi(x)]$ in $\Gamma$, by definition $x\in X$ so we know first $n+1$ coordinates of $x$ satisfy all the $G_j$ and the last $m+1$ coordinates satisfy them trivially as they do not appear. We need to see that $x$ satisfy the other $m$ polynomial. The polynomials $x_{n+i}-\phi_i$ are trivially satisfied by the definition of the graph thus $\Gamma \subset V(S)$. So we check $\Gamma \supset V(S)$. Satisfying the $x_{n+i}-\phi_i$ polynomials guarantees we are on the bigger graph $\Gamma' = \{(x,f(x)):x\in P^n\}$ and the other polynomials $G_i$ intersect the first $n$ coordinates with $X$ as a subspace, thus giving $\Gamma$. To see that $\Gamma$ is irreducible if $X$ is, we can look at the ideals of the polynomials. We know the ideal generated by $\{G_j\}$ is prime, and  the ideal generated by $\{-\phi_i+x_{n+i}\}$ are all prime because of the $x_{n+i}$ term being irreducible and degree 1. Since the ideal generators do not intersect, the ideal generated by their union is still prime and therefore the graph is irreducible. Two issues I have: the set $S$ needs to be all homogenous polynomials, and the $-\phi_i+x_{n+i}$ are clearly not since $x_{n+i}$ is degree 1 and $\phi_i$ can be any degree. I was thinking of raising $x_{n+1}$ to the degree of $\phi_i$ but I am not sure that would fix anything. Also, then my argument about irreducibility would not work. To be frank, I am not full convinced it works, but I tried several examples and it seems to be the case that if you have generates $S_i$ for a prime ideal and generators $T_i$ for a prime ideal and if $\{S_i\}\cap \{T_i\}=\emptyset$ then $\{S_i\}\cup \{T_i\}$ generates a prime ideal.",['algebraic-geometry']

352559,Prove that f[X] ≼ X iff X is finite.,"X is finite. Let f : X → Y be arbitrary. Prove that f[X] ≼ X. Suppose X=Y is finite. Show f : X → X is a surjection iff it is injective. If X is not finite, is it still true that f[X] ≼ X? With 2, I started by assuming f is injective and not surjective. Let x ∈ X and f(y) ̸ ≠ x for some y ∈ X.  But since f : X → X, then x ∈ X must go to X and two elements in X map to the same element. This contradicts injectivity. My problem is with part 1.  I understand f[X] is not necessarily Y. Eg  X = {0,1}, Y = {0,1,2}, f:X->Y s.t. f(x) = x+1, then f[X] = {1,2}. For this specific case, I would show there is an injective map from {1,2} to {0,1}. But the question is asking me to show  a proof that a function from f[X] to X is injective for any domain and any image. The problem though, is this. If the function is arbitrary, couldn't the function simply be not injective and multiple elements of the codomain map onto some x ∈ X? I don't get how this proof could work for any arbitrary function. Evidently, I am not seeing something simple. Could someone clear this up for me and give me pointers as to how to construct the proof? Also, why exactly is being finite/ infinite important in all of this? Thanks.",['elementary-set-theory']

I would like to show that the only symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^n(\operatorname{Sym}^2V)$ that contains trivial summands (e.g. $\mathbb{C}$ appears when decomposed into irreducible representations) are when $n=3k$ ($n$ is divisible by $3$), and that the trivial summand here is just the $k$-th power of the original trivial summand.

$$\operatorname{Sym}^3(\operatorname{Sym}^2V)=\operatorname{Sym}^6V\oplus \Gamma_{2,2}\oplus \mathbb{C},$$

This has real dimension $2(n-1)$, but since $X$ is an affine algebraic variety, the only possible non-zero topological Betti numbers of $X$ are $b_0,\ldots,b_{n-1}$. What is the top Betti number $b_{n-1}$? The real sphere $S^{n-1}$ embeds in $X$, determining a class in $H_{n-1}(X,\mathbb{Q})$. I wonder if this class actually spans the homology group. I have seem some results on Betti number for projective hypersurfaces, but not for affine ones.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-topology', 'betti-numbers']"
352785,"Coin Game, Probability and Fairness","The following game is being played : Player $\mathrm{B}$ pays to Player $\mathrm{A}$ an amount $\mathrm{X}$ and throws a coin at most $20$ times. If at the toss $k\space (k \leq 20)$ tail is thrown, the game stops and player $\mathrm{A}$ has to pay to player $\mathrm{B}$ $2^k$ cents. Else A gets to keep the stake $\mathrm{X}$. Now the questions are: When is the game fair and what is a corresponding fair stake $\mathrm{X}$?
I assume that since it is a binomial distribution, the expected value is $np$, hence here the expected value is $10$ and so $X = 10$ for a fair game. Does anything else has to be considered such that the game is fair? Now the game is changed as follows: $\mathrm{A}$ has only a capital of $50$ dollars, but he lets player $\mathrm{B}$ throw the coin $20$ times anyway. The rules are now changed such that $\mathrm{A}$ pays to player $\mathrm{B}$ $ (5000+X)$ cents if $\mathrm{B}$ throws tail for the first time at the $k$-th throw and $2^k > (5000+X)$ holds. What would be here a fair amount $\mathrm{X}$?","['decision-theory', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"
352798,Distribution of infinite sum of Poisson distributed r.v.,"Let $X_1,X_2\dots$ all be independent, Poisson distributed with parameter $l_i$ each.
Then it is known that for each n $S_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\sim \text{po}(\lambda_n)$ where $\lambda_n:=\sum_{i=1}^n l_i$. Now assume $\sum_{i=1}^\infty l_i = \lambda < \infty$ is it then true that $S:=\sum_{i=1}^\infty X_i \sim \text{po}(\lambda)$? I'm thinking for each $x\in \mathbb{N}_0$ by dominated convergence and continuity $$P(S=x)=E[1_{\{S=x\}}]=\lim_{n\to \infty} E[1_{\{S_n=x\}}]=\lim_{n\to \infty}P(S_n=x)=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\lambda_n^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda_n}=\frac{\lambda^x}{x!}e^{-\lambda}$$ But I can't find a result like this anywhere.

352818,"does $\oint_C P\,dx + Q \,dy = 0$ for all curves imply $P$ and $Q$ are harmonic conjugate functions?","(a) Suppose $P(x,y)$ and $Q(x,y)$ are conjugate harmonic functions and $C$ is any simple closed curve, prove that $\displaystyle \oint_C P\,dx + Q \,dy = 0$ . (b) If for all simple closed curves $C$ in the region $R$ , $\displaystyle \oint_C P\,dx + Q \,dy = 0$ , is it true that $P$ and $Q$ are harmonic conjugate functions? i.e. is converse of (a) true? For (a) since they are harmonic conjugate functions so they should satisfy Cauchy-Riemann equations and using Green's theorem, it can be shown. The problem is asked under the topic Morera's theorem . Can it be shown using Morera's theorem? How is it related to Morera's theorem? For (b), the closed loop integral for all curves implies $\displaystyle \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}$ . How show that it is harmonic or non harmonic? EDIT:: There seems to be a problem which states that if $\displaystyle \oint_C Pdx + Q dy = 0$ for all curves in the region bound by $C$ then show $\displaystyle \oint_C Q\,dx - P \,dy = 0$ . I can't prove this either but I think they are equivalent. Help!!",['complex-analysis']

352822,Why are log-probabilities of global states of Boltzmann machines linear in their energies?,"While going through the Wikipedia article about Boltzmann machines, I read the following on the probabilities of global states of Boltzmann machines in the ""Equilibrium state"" section ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine#Equilibrium_state ): The network is run by repeatedly choosing a unit and setting its state
  according to the above formula. After running for long enough at a
  certain temperature, the probability of a global state of the network
  will depend only upon that global state's energy, according to a
  Boltzmann distribution. This means that log-probabilities of global
  states become linear in their energies . The probability of a global state is usually defined as: $$ P(x) = \frac{e^{-Energy(x)}}{Z}, $$ where the partition function Z is: $$ Z = \sum_u{e^{-Energy(u)}}. $$ However, taking log of P(x): $$ \log{P(x)} = -Energy(x) - \log{(\sum_u{e^{-Energy(u)}})},$$ we arrive at an expression of the log probability of a global state which is not linear. Could you tell me where I'm wrong?","['statistics', 'dynamical-systems', 'machine-learning']"
352826,The continuity assumption in Schwarz's reflection principle,"The Schwarz reflection principle says (Serge Lang, Complex Analysis, 1993): Let $U^+$ be a connected open set in the upper half plane, and suppose that the boundary of $U^+$ contains an open interval $I$ of real numbers. Let $U^-$ be the reflection of $U^+$ across the real axis. If $f$ is a function on $U^+\cup I$, analytic on $U^+$ and continuous on I, and f is real valued on $I$, then $f$ has a unique analytic continuation on $U^+\cup I\cup U^-$. I wonder if the assumption ""$f$ is continuous on $I$"" could be replaced by the weaker assumption that ""$\text{Im}(f)$ is continuous on $I$"", since the analogue reflection theorem for harmonic functions only needs such a weaker assumption. Or is there a counter-example?",['complex-analysis']
