1008114,what are the fppf covers of an algebraically closed field,"I'm trying to get a feel for Grothendieck topologies by considering some really simple examples (and this relates to a question in Kleiman's chapter on the Picard Scheme in FGA explained). I know that the etale covers of $\text{Spec}(k)$ are precisely the spectra of finite separable field extensions of $k$ (or perhaps finite disjoint unions of such spectra). Thus if $k$ is algebraically closed, there are no non-trivial etale covers. So, moving to the finer fppf topology, I'd like to know what the fppf covers of $\text{Spec}(k)$ for $k$ an algebraically closed field look like. This is how far I've got: If $T\xrightarrow{f} \text{Spec}(k)$ is fppf, then for any open affine $U = \text{Spec}(A)\subset T$, $A$ must be a finitely presented $k$-algebra. It will automatically be flat over $k$, since $k$ is a field. I can't see any other restriction on $T$, so it apears as if the fppf covers of $\text{Spec}(k)$ should be all $k$-schemes of finite type. But this seems like way too many covers, especially considering how there weren't any etale covers. So have I done this right or am I missing something?

1008207,"Proving Reflexivity, Symmetry and Transitivity of a Relation","I'm currently taking an intro discrete math course, and I'm having some trouble understanding the rules of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The book isn't making a lot of sense to me, and my professors examples haven't been very clear. I have two problems in which I'm not confident in my answers. 1) There is a set S = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and a relation R on S, defined by R = {(1,1),(3,4),(4,2),(4,1),(3,2)}. I need to determine if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. A relation is reflexive if, and only if, xRx for all elements x in S, correct?
So there is only one tuple where x relates to itself, so R is not reflexive A relation is symmetric if, and only if, if xRy then yRx for all (x,y) pairs in S, correct?
In this relation, there are no instances where x relates to y and y relates to x, so R is not symmetric A relation is transitive if, and only if, xRy and yRz then xRz for all x,y,z pairs in S, correct? This relation has one instance of transitivity, where 3R4 and 4R2 then 3R2, but transitivity doesn't hold true for all pairs (pairs including 1), so R is not transitive ? 2) There is a set S = {all real numbers}, and a relation R defined by: R is the set of all ordered pairs (x,y) such that x and y are real numbers, 1 < x < 2 AND x = y. I need to determine if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Since, by definition of R, x = y wouldn't that mean that every (x,y) tuple that would be part of R would contain an x and y such that x = y, so the elements would relate to themselves? So they would be reflexive. But this relation is also limited to 1 < x <2. So this relation obviously doesn't hold all possible ordered pairs possible in the set of real numbers. So I would say that R is not reflexive . Is that correct reasoning? By definition of R, I know that x = y so y = x, so the proposition if xRy then yRx would be true in this case. So I would think that R is symmetric , but I don't know how the stipulation 1 < x <2 plays into this. Also, This relation won't have every ordered pair in S, so would that mean it's not symmetric? You could prove transitivity with the transitive law if x=y and y=z then x=z , but again I don't see how it would apply to all ordered pairs or satisfy the 1 < x < 2, so I'd say not transitive tl;dr: I'm having problems proving reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of the following:
1) set S = {1,2,3,4} relation R = {(1,1),(3,4),(4,2),(4,1),(3,2)}
2) set S = {all real numbers} relation R = {(x,y)|1 < x < 2 and x=y}","['relations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'elementary-set-theory']"

1008286,Folland Exercise 3.3: Stuck + Possibly missing $\sigma$-finite hypothesis?,"This is Exercise 3.3 from Folland's Real Analysis, Second Edition stated exactly as it appears in the text: ''Let $\nu$ be a signed measure $(X, \mathcal{M})$. $(a)$  $L^1(\nu) = L^1(|\nu|)$. $(b)$  If $f \in L^1(\nu)$, $|\int f d\nu| \leq \int |f|d|\nu|$. $(c)$  If $E \in \mathcal{M}$, $|\nu|(E) = \sup \{ |\int_E f d\nu| \colon |f| \leq 1 \}$.'' Parts $(a)$ and $(b)$ are easy to show.  My question concerns part $(c)$.  First off, I immediately assumed that Folland meant $$ |\nu|(E) = \sup A := \sup \bigg\{ \bigg| \int_E f d\nu \bigg| \colon f \in L^1(\nu) \text{ and } |f| \leq 1 \bigg\}, $$ although, as we shall see soon, this interpretation may be up for debate. It is quick to show using $(b)$ that $|\nu|(E)$ is an upper bound for $A$.  For the other direction, what seems close to the right method is to first set a Hahn decomposition $P \cup N$ for $\nu = \nu^+ + \nu^-$, and then to let $$f(x) = 1 \text{ if } x \in P \text{ and } f(x) = -1 \text{ if } x \in N.$$ Then, $|f| \leq 1$ and $$ \int_E f d\nu = \int_{P \cap E} f d\nu^+ - \int_{N \cap E} f d\nu^- = |\nu|(E) \geq 0, \tag{*}$$ so that $|\nu|(E) \in A$ and is thus the supremum. However, upon closer look, we have $$ \int_X|f| \chi_E d\nu^+ = |\nu|(E \cap P) \;\;\; \text{ and } \;\;\; \int_X|f| \chi_E d\nu^- = |\nu|(E \cap N), $$ and if either of these quantities are $\infty$, then $f\chi_E \notin L^1(\nu)$ and equation $(*)$ becomes nonsense.  (Recall by definition that $f \in L^1(\nu)$ iff $f \in L^1(\nu^+) \cap L^1(\nu^-)$.) Since we are not given any finiteness conditions on $\nu$, we are thus forced to consider this possibility.  I have not been able to get around this difficulty, and I can only make headway by assuming that $\nu$ is at least $\sigma$-finite. My question: Can anyone see a way to prove the result without assuming $\nu$ is $\sigma$-finite?  (This would be the most desirable answer.)  Alternatively, is the $\sigma$-finite condition necessary (and/or sufficient)? Thanks.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

1008549,Prove an integral operator is compact,"The statement is like this, $K\subset\mathbb{R}$ is compact, the operator $A:L^\infty(K)\mapsto L^\infty(K)$ is defined by $f(x)\mapsto\int_K k(x,y)f(y)dy$. For $x\neq y$, $|k(x,y)|\leq M|x-y|^{\alpha-2}$, where $\alpha\in(0,2]$ and $M$ is constant. Show $A$ is a compact operator. I thought about Hilbert-Schmidt operator first. However, I noted that, although we can relax $L^\infty(K)$ to $L^2(K)$ (because $L^\infty\subset L^2$, is that correct?), $k\notin L^2(K\times K)$. So the condition for Hilbert-Schmidt is not satisfied. Information about $k$ is not enough, so it seems difficult to construct $\{k_n\}$ that makes $A_n$ compact and converge to $A$ - so that $A$ is compact. Therefore, now I am thinking about Arzela-Ascoli. So, I think I should take a bounded sequence $f_n(x)$ in $L^\infty(K)$, and prove that $Af_n$ is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. For uniformly boundedness,
$$
||Af_n||_\infty=\sup_{x\in K}|\int_Kk(x,y)f_n(y)dy|\leq\sup_{x\in K}\int_KM|x-y|^{\alpha-2}|f_n(y)|dy
$$
Then I get stuck in how to obtain the bound. For equicontinuity,
$$
||Af_n(x_1)-Af_n(x_2)||_\infty=\sup_{x_1,x_2\in K}|\int_K[k(x_1,y)-k(x_2,y)]f_n(y)dy|\leq\sup_{x_1,x_2\in K}\int_K|k(x_1,y)-k(x_2,y)||f_n(y)|dy
$$
Again I got stuck in bounding the integral. So, is my general idea correct? If so, how should I proceed to bound the two integrals? Any helpful suggestion will be appreciated! Thanks in advance! Update: I got an idea in using sequence of compact operators. Maybe we can consider $k_n(x,y)$ such that $|k_n|\leq \frac{M}{|x-y|^{2-\alpha}+\delta}$, where $\delta>0$. $A_n$ can be defined by using $k_n$ as kernel. It seems $k_n\in L^2(K\times K)$ and $A_n$ is Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator, then $A_n$ is compact. Then we only need to prove that $A_n\rightarrow A$. I am working on details of that idea. By the way, the bound for $k(x,y)$ in the statement is correct. Actually, that form is common in Green's functions.","['integral-operators', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

1008732,Integral that arises from the derivation of Kummer's Fourier expansion of $\ln{\Gamma(x)}$,"I am trying to prove that for $0<x<1$,

It is quite straightforward to compute $a_0$ and $a_n$. $a_0$ is
\begin{align}
a_0
=2\int^1_0\ln{\Gamma(x)}\ {\rm d}x
=\int^1_0\ln\left(\frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi x)}\right)\ {\rm d}x
=\ln(2\pi)\\

As for $a_n$,
\begin{align}
a_n
=&2\int^1_0\ln{\Gamma(x)}\cos(2\pi nx)\ {\rm d}x
=\int^1_0\ln\left(\frac{\color{grey}{\pi}}{\sin(\pi x)}\right)\cos(2\pi nx)\ {\rm d}x\\
=&-\frac{1}{\pi}\int^\pi_0\ln(\sin{x})\cos(2nx)\ {\rm d}x
=\frac{1}{4n\pi}\int^\pi_{-\pi}\frac{\sin(2nx)\cos(x)}{\sin{x}}\ {\rm d}x
\end{align}
If we name the remaining integral $\mathcal{I}_n$, it is easy to see that $\mathcal{I}_{n+1}-\mathcal{I}_n=0$. Hence $\mathcal{I}_n=\mathcal{I}_1=2\pi$, and
$$a_n=\frac{2\pi}{4n\pi}=\frac{1}{2n}$$
However, I have trouble calculating $b_n$ and proving that
$$\color{red}{2\int^1_0\ln{\Gamma(x)}\sin(2n\pi x)\ {\rm d}x=\frac{\gamma+\ln(2n\pi)}{\pi n}}$$
The only idea that I can think of is to use the series representation of $\ln{\Gamma(x)}$
\begin{align}
\ln{\Gamma(x)}
=&-\gamma x-\ln{x}+\sum^\infty_{k=1}\left\{\frac{x}{k}-\ln\left(1+\frac{x}{k}\right)\right\}\\
=&-\gamma x-\ln{x}+\sum^\infty_{m=2}\frac{(-1)^m\zeta(m)}{m}x^m
\end{align}
and multiply throughout by $\sin(2n\pi x)$ then integrating term by term. However, arriving to the final result using this method definitely seems arduous.

If, instead of an amoeba, there was a single point (i.e. $f$ was a function from $R$ to $R^2$), then I would just say that $f$ should be a continuous function.

1009097,Hartshorne's Exercise II. 2.15 (fully faithful functor),"I'm struggling with the last part of the exercise. Namely, let $V,W$ be any two varieties over a field $k$. We build the functor $t$, which induces a natural map 
$$
\mbox{Hom}_{Var}(V,W)\xrightarrow{\beta} \mbox{Hom}_{Sch}(tV,tW)

we need to prove the map is bijective (i.e. we want to show that $t$ is fully faithful). Here's what I've done so far: first, let $f:V\to W$. Recall that the map $\beta(f)$ between topological spaces sends an irreducible closed subset of $V$, say $C$, to $\overline{f(C)}\in tW$. We have a bijection between open sets $U$ in $V$ and open sets $tU$ in $tV$, this allows us to define $\beta(f)^{\sharp}$ between the sheaves. Injectivity is easy: using the two preceeding parts of the exercise we see that a morphism of schemes sends point with residue field $k$ to points with residue field $k$, and these points correspond exactly to the points of the varieties. Hence if $\beta(f)=\beta(g)$, in particular for all points $p\in V$, we have $f(p)=\overline{f(p)}=\beta(f)(p)=\beta(g)(p)=\overline{g(p)}=g(p)$. Furthermore, the sheaves are not problematic (using the definition of push forward, and the fact that $f,g$ coincide on the variety). Hence $f=g$ as morphisms of varieties. Now comes surjectivity and my problem: take a morphism of schemes $F:tV\to tW$. This sends closed points to closed points. Its restriction to closed points induces $f:V\to W$. This map is continuous, because $F$ is continuous and the topologies are in a bijection. Also, the pull-back of regular functions is induced nicely by $F$. The last thing to prove would be the following: that $\beta(f)=F$. In particular, I want to show that for an irreducible closed subset $C$ of $V$, $F(C)=\overline{f(C)}$.

1009180,irregular pairs in half graphs - Szemeredi regularity,"Szemeredi's regularity lemma is a well-known result about partitioning large graphs into pieces such that most pairs of pieces are ""regular"". The precise statement takes a bit of detail so I'll just refer to the the Wikipedia link. My question is about the part of the lemma saying ""all except $\epsilon k^2$ of the pairs $V_i$, $V_j$ are $\epsilon$-pseudo random"". (Note: ""pseudo-random"" and ""regular"" seem to be somewhat interchangeable in this context.) Concerning the necessity of these ""irregular"" pairs, a frequently cited example is the ""half-graph"". In particular, given $n>0$, the half-graph of height $n$ , $H_n$, is described as follows: $V(H_n)=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n,w_1,\ldots,w_n\}$, given, $1\leq i,j\leq n$, $(v_i,w_j)\in E(H_n)$ if and only if $i\leq j$, no other edges are present in $H_n$ (so $(\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\},\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\})$ is a bipartition for $H_n$). The graphs $H_n$ were the first observed example of where irregular pairs in Szemeredi's Lemma are necessary. I have two questions about this. 1) What is the precise statement of this claim about irregular pairs in half graphs? 2) Is there a source where this claim is explained in detail? Remarks: Concerning question 1, the closest thing I have found is Section 2.1.2 of this survey paper, which says: ""The reader is invited to prove that, for small enough $\epsilon>0$, any $(\epsilon,k)$-equitable, $\epsilon$-regular partition of [$H_n$] requires at least $ck$ $\epsilon$-irregular pairs, where $c=c(\epsilon)>0$ is some constant that depends only on $\epsilon$."" But I am still uncertain on exactly how $n$ and $k$ are being quantified in this statement. My best guess is: ""For any small enough $\epsilon>0$, there is $c=c(\epsilon)>0$ such that for all $k$ there some large enough $n$ such that any $(\epsilon,k)$-equitable, $\epsilon$-regular partition of $H_n$ requires at least $ck$ $\epsilon$-irregular pairs."" Concerning question 2, I have only found sources that mention half-graphs as examples of irregular pairs.

My question is whether $ \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}{P(C_{n})} = P(\mathbb{N}) $ ? I believe this seems true because on the LHS above, we have a union of an infinite number of power sets of the counting number sets, $ C_{1}, C_{2}, ...$, so this should give us all of the subsets of the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, which by definition is $P(\mathbb{N})$ on the RHS.

There is a proof in Munkres topology that a nonempty compact Hausdorff space which has no isolated points is uncountable. Obviously, this is satisfied by closed intervals in $\mathbb R $, but in $Q $, compact subsets must have isolated points ( this follows from an argument using Baire's category theorem). And can this be shown to follow from completeness? So can one say that the uncountability of the real numbers hinges on the fact that we have compact sets that are perfect, whereas the set of rationals havn't?

Let $X=\coprod_{\alpha\in A}(U_\alpha\times\mathbf R^k)$. You want to find a relation ${\sim}$ on $X$ such that $X/{\sim}$ and $E$ are in bijection. The obvious candidate for a bijection is the one defined on each $U_\alpha\times\mathbf R^k$ by $\phi:(p,v)\in U_\alpha\times\mathbf R^k \mapsto (p,v)\in E_p$. This $\phi$ is surjective, but not injective: if $p$ is in $U_\alpha\cap U_\beta$, then both $(p,v)\in U_\alpha\times\mathbf R^k$ and $(p,v)\in U_\beta\times\mathbf R^k$ are sent to $(p,v)\in E_p$. The obvious solution is to define the relation ${\sim}$ by: for $(p,v)\in U_\alpha\times\mathbf R^k$ and $(q,w)\in U_\beta\times\mathbf R^k$, say that $(p,v)\sim(q,w)$ when $p=q$ and $w=\tau_{\alpha\beta}(p)v$. Then $\phi$ gives a bijection $X/{\sim}\to E$, and you can use it to build the bijections $\Phi_\alpha$ in the construction lemma."" The confusing thing is that if we define the equivalence relation like that, we can not say whether $(p,v)\in U_{\alpha}\times\mathbb{R}^k$ and $(p,v)\in U_{\beta}\times\mathbb{R}^k$ are equivalent to each other, because then we would have $v=\tau_{\alpha\beta}(p)v$, but how can we know if this is true?

Then $\nu_1 \times \nu_2 <\!\!< \mu_1 \times \mu_2$. Here is about where I am at. (1)  It is immediate that if $\mu_1 \times \mu_2(A \times B) = 0$, then $\nu_1 \times \nu_2(A \times B) = 0$. (2)  Because $\nu_1 \times \nu_2$ is $\sigma$-finite, it is enough to prove the result for when $\nu_1 \times \nu_2$ is finite.  Since the result is quickly verified if either $\nu_1$ or $\nu_2$ is the zero measure, we may assume that both $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are finite.  We then have the following equivalent formulation for $\nu_1 <\!\!< \mu_1$: For every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $\mu_1(E) < \delta$ implies $\nu_1(E) < \epsilon$. And similarly for $\nu_2 <\!\!< \mu_2$. I thought I might be able to prove the same condition for $\nu_1 \times \nu_2$ with respect to $\mu_1 \times \mu_2$, which would then imply $\nu_1 \times \nu_2 <\!\!< \mu_1 \times \mu_2$ since $\nu_1 \times \nu_2$ has been reduced to being finite.  As a suggestion, following Folland's technique, it might be easier to argue by contradiction, assuming first the $\epsilon-\delta$ condition is false. (3)  If $\mu_1 \times \mu_2(E) = 0$, then, by definition, $$0 = \inf \bigg\{ \sum_n \mu_1(A_n)\mu_2(B_n) \colon A_n \times B_n \text{ are rectangles such that } E \subset \bigcup_n A_n \times B_n\bigg\}.$$ To show $\nu_1 \times \nu_2(E) = 0$, we want to show that the analogous equation holds for $\nu_1 \times \nu_2$.

Here $$\mathrm{d}t (v)$$ is a one-form that takes a tangent vector from $T_p$ and returns a real number, $\mathrm {d}t(v) \in \mathbb {R}$. The tangent vector to a curve $x^{\mu}(\lambda)$ in the basis $\partial_\mu$ is $$v=\frac {dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\partial_\mu$$ Now apply the one-form to this vector $$\mathrm {d}t(\frac {dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\partial_\mu)=\frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\mathrm {d}t(\partial_\mu)$$
$$ =\frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac {\partial t}{\partial x^\mu}$$
$$=\frac {dt}{d\lambda}$$ Now the above metric, in terms of one-forms read $$0=-\mathrm {d}t^2(v,v)+\mathrm {d}x^2(v,v)=-\mathrm {d}t(v)\mathrm {d}t(v)+\mathrm{d}x(v)\mathrm {d}x(v)$$ $$=-(\frac {dt}{d\lambda})^2+(\frac {dx}{d\lambda})^2$$ If we use the chain rule $$\frac {dx}{dt}=\frac {dx}{d\lambda}\frac {d\lambda}{dt}$$ We eventually obtain $$dx=\pm dt \to x=\pm t$$ The above is from Carroll's page 77.

What are the unit and co-unit? Supposedly, adjunctions in category theory allow us to compare an object from one category to an object from another category? But, in vector spaces, both the source and target categories are the category of vector spaces over F (right?). So, why do we need an adjunction? According to Wikipedia, adjunctions provide a way to find a universal solution to a diagram (if I'm reading this correctly). In the context of vector spaces, dual spaces/adjoints allow us to find what universal solution to what diagram? Also, can anyone recommend further reading about this. All the stuff I read on category theory does not say much about adjunctions in vector spaces. Thanks a lot!","['adjoint-operators', 'category-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'adjoint-functors']"
1009624,Path Connectedness and fixed points,"We have the following given to us, Let $α, β \colon [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$ be (not necessarily continuous) functions such that $α(x) ≤ β(x)$, for all $x ∈ [0, 1]$. The set $K = \{\,(x, y); α(x) ≤ y ≤ β(x)\,\}$ is closed in $\mathbb R^2$
. Show that there exists $t ∈ [0, 1]$ such that $(t, t) ∈ K$. We think that if $K$ is closed, then it must be path-connected. In which case, we have a continuous function from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ that is contained in $K$. Therefore can use the intermediate value theorem to show that this function must have a fixed point, which would conclude our argument. Our difficulty is that we are unable to prove that $K$ is actually path-connected, even though every example of $α$ and $β$ that we can think of satisfying the required properties make $K$ path connected.","['connectedness', 'fixed-point-theorems', 'analysis']"

1009649,Why is the sample set denoted with $\chi$ in statistics?,"My professor of statistics based his lesson notations on H. Georgii's work 'Stochastics'. The sample set is thereby notated as $\chi$, instead of the usual $\Omega$. I don't really understand the reason for this. At page 190, Georggi writes: The notation $\chi$ instead of $\Omega$ is based on the idea that the observation is given by a random variable $X\colon\Omega\to\chi$, where $\Omega$ yields a detailed description of the randomness, whereas $\chi$ contains only the actually observable outcomes. However, since only the distribution of $X$ (rather than $X$ itself) plays a role, $\Omega$ does not appear explicitly here. Although this fragment is obviously ment as a clarification, I don't fully get it. Can you explain it a little bit better for me, please?","['statistics', 'notation']"
1009658,Problem related to the ring $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{d}]$,"Let $d \in \mathbb Z$ and let $\sqrt{d} \in \mathbb C$ be a square root of $d$. Consider the subring of $\mathbb C$, $$\mathbb Z[{d}]=\{a+b\sqrt{d}: a,b \in \mathbb Z \}$$ and we define the norm of an element in $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{d}]$ by $N(a+b\sqrt{d})=a^2-db^2$. Prove the following: 1) $z \in \mathbb Z[\sqrt{d}]$ is a unit if and only if $N(z)=\pm1$. 2) The ring $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{d}]$ is prefactorial, i.e., every non zero element which is not a unit can be written as product of irreducible elements. I'll write what I could do: 1) Suppose $N(z)=\pm 1$, where $z=a+b\sqrt{d}$. Then $(a+b\sqrt{d})\dfrac{a-b\sqrt{d}}{a^2-b^2d}=1$, so the candidate for $z^{-1}$ is $\dfrac{a-b\sqrt{d}}{a^2-b^2d}$. From here it is clear that if $N(z)=\pm 1 \implies z^{-1} \in Z[\sqrt{d}]$. I couldn't prove the other implication. I don't know what to do in 2), I would appreciate suggestions.","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1009722,SU(2) subgroups of SU(4)?,"The Wikipedia article on Gell-Mann matrices states that there are 3 independent SU(2) subgroups of SU(3). One of them, for example, is given by the generators $\{ \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \}$, which satisfy the commutation relation of the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. How can I found similar subgroups of SU(4) such that their combination satisfy a commutation relation of the form $[t_a, t_b] = \epsilon_{abc} t_c$ as well? So far I am aware of three such ways -  for example the matrices A, B and B, where $B= i( t_2 + t_{14}) $, $C= i(t_5 - t_{12})$ and $D= i (t_7 +  t_{10})$ and $t_i$ are the 4x4 generators of SU(4), obey the above commutation relation.

if every 0 must be immediately followed by a 1? Note: There is a similar but also very different question on this site . Please do not report this as a duplicate because it is not! My Attempt I thought could we not also have $8$ 01 strings and $2$ 1 bits. This ensures that 0 is directly followed by a 1. I then have 9 spaces (since the 01 will occupy two of our 18 spaces) to distribute these into, which can be done in 9 ways, then I put the 1s in the remaining spaces, giving us 9 bit strings. My Problem My answer was not correct. My textbook gives the answer 45. I'm wondering what was wrong with my approach, and how I would approach this question correctly.","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
1009801,Roadmap to Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields,"I am a beginning graduate student with (almost) no background in algebraic geometry.
I would like to learn the proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, including all prerequisites. I am looking for books to get me there. I am not necessarily looking for the quickest way, but rather for self-contained well-written books that will get me to this result. Nevertheless, I prefer to be focused and study only the needed prerequisites in the adequate generality (in particular, I'm focusing on the case of curves, rather than more general varieties). (my knowledge in group theory, field theory, and algebraic number theory is equivalent to what appears in J.S. Milne's notes, but as mentioned - I have almost no background in algebraic geometry).","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request', 'algebraic-curves']"
1009822,Why is Existence and Uniqueness for Navier-Stokes Easier in 2-D than in 3-D? [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Why Navier-Stokes Partial Differential Equations Are Difficult To Simulate (1 answer) Closed 10 months ago . I know that existence and uniqueness for incompressible viscous flow in the 2-D case has already been established$^1$, and that doing the same for the 3-D case has yet to be shown. Not only that, but it's one of the hardest problems out there in mathematics today. Clearly then, the 2-D case is considerably easier than the 3-D case, but why is this so? As quoted from the Navier-Stokes Millenium Problem's problem statement, ""This gives no hint about the three-dimensional case, since the main
  difficulties are absent in two dimensions."" What are these main difficulties? I'm looking for any answers, going as deep into any subjects as necessary. I'm ready to read long and deeply for this. P.S: I've only started self-studying basic partial-differential equations, but I'm really interested in numerical (and analytic too) methods for solving PDE's. [1] Ladyzhenskaya, Olga A.

ways are there for three medals to be awarded if ties

fastest time receive gold medals, the runner or runners
who finish with exactly one runner ahead receive silver
medals, and the runner or runners who finish with exactly
two runners ahead receive bronze medals.) My Attempt I saw a few cases: Case I: No Ties P(6,3) = 120 ways to pick the gold medal Case II: 2 people tie First we must pick the two people who tie, this can be done C(6,2) = 15 ways. Now I have to pick a medal for them to win, which opens up more cases because if they tie for first no silver medal is awarded and if they tie for second no bronze medal is awarded. My Problem My problem with this method is that it takes way too long to consider all the cases and wouldn't be practical if I was writing a test, or if I was designing an algorithm for this type of question. I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to solve this? The Answer My book gave the answer $873$ if that helps at all","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
