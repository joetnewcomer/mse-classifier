516796,Counting Fractional Linear Transformations,"This is a problem from Ahlfors' Complex analysis, Section 3.5. In an obvious way, which we shall not try to make precise, a family of [Möbius] transformations depends on a certain number of real parameters. How many real parameters are there in the family of all [fractional] linear transformations? How many in the families of hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic transformations? How many fractional linear transformations leave a given circle invariant? I'm not really sure what he's getting at.
I am wondering my thoughts below are in the general direction of what kind of reasoning he's looking for. All fractional linear transformations $Tz = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ looks like it has 4 complex numbers, so at first I thought there should be 8 real numbers involved. But, many collections give the same transformation, so if you normalize using the determinant, you're left with three degrees of freedom in complex numbers. So you need 6 real parameters. Hyperbolic transformations You can write these like $\frac{Tz - a}{Tz - b} = k \frac{z-a}{z-b}$, where $k$ is real, and $a$ and $b$ are complex. So you need 5 real numbers to specify one. Elliptic transformations Pretty much the same as hyperbolic, except $k = e^{i\theta}$. So also 5 parameters in this case. Parabolic transformations You can write these like $\frac{\omega}{Tz - a} = \frac{\omega}{z-a} + c$ where $\omega$ and $a$ are complex and $c$ is real. So again 5 real parameters. Transformations taking a given circle to itself Pich three points on the circle $z_1, z_2, z_3$. Transformations taking the circle to itself are in bijective correspondence with triples $w_1, w_2, w_3$ with $|w_i - c| = r$.
 So $w_i = c + r e^{ i \theta_i}$. One real parameter is required for each $w_i$, and so three real parameters are required to specify such a transformation.","['mobius-transformation', 'complex-analysis']"

This statement came up in an algebraic geometry text with no explanation provided, and I'm trying to understand why it's true. Thoughts so far: Since $H^0(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(m))$ is the vector space of regular sections of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(m)$ over $\mathbb{P}^n$, we can try to find a basis. Since the regular sections are the degree $m$ polynomials in $x_0, \dots, x_n$, it seems like the collection of degree $m$ monomials in $x_0, \dots, x_n$ should work. But I don't see how there are ${n + m \choose n}$ of these. Is it just a basic counting argument that I'm struggling with? On a side note, I think I understand what global sections of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(m)$ look like, but how can we describe the regular sections over a distinguished open set $D(f)$?

516886,Prove that a subset of a separable set is itself separable,"The problem statement, all variables and given/known data: Show that if $X$ is a subset of $M$ and $(M,d)$ is separable, then $(X,d)$ is separable. [This may be a little bit trickier than it looks - $E$ may be a countable dense subset of $M$ with $X\cap E = \varnothing$.] 
Definitions
Per our book: A metric space $(M,d)$ is separable if there exists a countable dense $E$ contained in $M$. $E$ contained in $M$ is dense if $\forall m\in M$, $\forall ε>0\in\mathbb R$, $\exists e\in E$ s.t. $d(m,e) < ε$ The attempt at a solution My best attempt was doomed from the start, because I don't quite understand the hint. My thought process went as follows: Since $X$ is a subset of $M$, $\forall x\in X, x\in M$. Thus, since $E$ is dense in $M$, $\forall x\in X$, and ε > 0, $\exists e\in E$ st $d(x,e)<ε $. At this point, I was done, because the set of $e$'s satisfying the above, is a subset of $E$, a countable set. So a subset of a countable set is dense in $X$, and $X$ is separable. This is incorrect, but I cannot see why.

516889,Proof that $n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n$ is a multiple of $3$.,"I'm struggling with this problem: For any natural number $n$, prove that $n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n$ is a multiple of $3$. That $n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n$ is a multiple of $3$ means that: $n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n = 3 \times k$ where $k \in \mathbb N$
So I tried to find a the number $k$. The best result I found was: $n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n = n(n+1)(n+2)$ 
But I'm lagging at the last step, to prove that it is a multiple of $3$. (However, I got the intuition, If you see the multiples of $3$: $\{0, 3, 6, 9,\dotsc\}$ there is a difference of $3$ between them. So $n(n+1)(n+2)$ incorporates that difference. This means that if you take a number $n$ then $n$ or $n+1$ or $n+2$ could be a multiple of $3$ and so their multiplication is a multiple of $3$) But I couldn't extend that idea into a consistent mathematical proof. Also this problem doesn't help either: Proof that $n^3+2n$ is divisible by $3$","['elementary-number-theory', 'arithmetic', 'algebra-precalculus']"

In other words, there's no analogue of Mazur's Lemma for the $w^{\ast}$-topology. As a hint, I'm given that a functional in a TVS is continuous iff it's kernel is closed. I thought about two main approaches to tackle the problem: (1st) $X$ non-reflexive implies at least one $\psi \in X^{\ast \ast}$ s.t. $\psi \notin i[X]$, $i[X]$ being the canonical embbeding of $X$ in it's second dual. Therefore, $\ker \psi$ is a closed, convex subset of $X^{\ast}$, and I'd have to show that it's not $w^\ast$-closed. The problem here is that I just can't find any direct connection between $w^\ast$-closedness and $\psi \notin i[X]$, and also, I don't see where I could use $X$ Banach. (2nd) $X$ Banach non-reflexive implies that $i[X]$ as above is a proper, closed subspace of $X^{\ast \ast}$. Therefore, I could use a separation theorem to find $\Gamma$ in $X^{\ast \ast \ast}$ s.t. $\text{Re } \Gamma (\psi_{0}) > \sup_{x \in X} \Gamma(i(x))$ for some $\psi_{0} \notin i[X]$, and then try to get some useful result from embedding $X^{\ast}$ in $X^{\ast \ast \ast}$, maybe by using Goldstine's theorem about $w^{\ast}$-density. The problem here is that it seems too confusing, and I just couldn't get very far with so many embeddings. Specially considering that embedding is an $w-w^{\ast}$ homeomorphism, so if I get results about $w^{\ast}$ in the embedding of the first dual in the third dual, it translates as a result about $w$ in the first dual.

517211,Looking for guidance on a Fourier integral,"Working with a Fourier transform problem, I've encountered the following integral: $$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\exp\left(-a^2x^2+ibx\right)}{x^2+c^2}dx
$$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real coefficients.  Mathematica claims that this has no closed-form solution, but I suspect (hope?) that's not the case.  Unfortunately, my background in complex analysis is limited to some panic-studying I did to make it through a field theory course a decade ago.  I've spent the weekend dusting that off, but am still stumped... I know there's a pole at $z=ci$.  If I take (to me) the obvious extension of the integral to the complex plane by simply replacing $x$ with $z$, I can even calculate its residue as: $$
\frac{\exp\left(a^2c^2-bc\right)}{2ci}
$$ My hope was to integrate over a semicircle in the positive half-plane, and use this residue to get the integral along the real axis.  However, with this extension, the integral over the semicircle of radius R doesn't seem to be zero (or possibly even converge) with R going to infinity -- or at least, Jordan's lemma doesn't give me any reason to believe so, since the $-a^2z^2$ part becomes unfriendly on the imaginary axis. I vaguely recall there being a strategy for dealing with this sort of problem.  I specifically recall the strategy not being to use $zz^*$, since explicit dependence on the complex conjugate was a no-go.  For the life of me, though, I can't recall what the strategy was . If anybody can (a) refresh my memory on this; (b) give a solution method; or (c) explain why no closed form solution exists, that would be much appreciated.

The function $\psi: X \to pt(\Omega(X))$ sends a point $x\in X$ to $\overline{ \{ x\} }^c$ . $pt(\Omega(X))$ has the topology of subspace of $Spec(\Omega(X))$ . I would like to prove that this function is always continuous, and it is injective if and only if $X$ is $T_0$ . To prove that $\psi$ is injective if and only if $X$ is $T_0$ is really simple, because $\psi(x)=\psi(y)$ iff $\overline{ \{ x\} }^c$ = $\overline{ \{ y\} }^c$ iff $x, y$ are contained in exactly the same open sets.
So, $\psi(x)=\psi(y)$ implies $x=y$ iff $X$ is $T_0$ . So, the proof of continuity is left.
I was also wondering when this function is onto. Any help or hint is appreciated. Edit: So far I've managed to come up with a characterization of $X$ so that $\psi$ is onto: $\psi$ is onto if and only if for any $x,y\in X$ such that $y\notin\overline{\{x\}}$ we have $\overline{\{x,y\}}$ is not connected.

Where the numerator is a binomial polynomial (For ex:$\text{Cos} (6 \text{Arctan} x)=\frac{-x^6+15 x^4-15 x^2+1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^3}$,$\text{Cos} (7 \text{Arctan} x)=\frac{-7 x^6+35 x^4-21 x^2+1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^{7/2}}$,etc...) admitting solutions in the form $\pm \text{Tan}\left(\frac{(2k+1) \pi  }{2n}\right)$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Using a set $S=\left\{\text{  }\tan ^2\left(\frac{1\pi  }{2n}\right), \tan ^2\left(\frac{3\pi  }{2n}\right), \tan ^2\left(\frac{5\pi  }{2n}\right)\text{  },\text{...},\tan ^2\left(\frac{(2k-1)\pi  }{2n}\right) \right\}$ with $k$ in range $\left[1,\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor\right]$, we can then rewrite the numerator as a same order polynomial:
$$
\text{Cos}(n \text{Arctan} x)=\frac{\left(x^2-\text{Tan}^2\left(\frac{1\pi }{2n}\right)\right)\left(x^2-\text{Tan}^2\left(\frac{3\pi }{2n}\right)\right)\text{...}\left(x^2-\text{Tan}^2\left(\frac{(2k-1)\pi }{2n}\right)\right)}{\left(1+x^2\right)^{\frac{n}{2}}}
$$
Expanding the numerator and matching the binomial coefficient for each order gives one formula, the other coming from:
$$
\text{Sin}(n \text{Arctan} x)=\frac{z^n-z^{*n}}{2i |z|^n}=\frac{\sum _{k=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor } (-1)^k\text{  }\left(
\begin{array}{c}
 n \\
 2 k+1

\right)x^{2 k+1}}{\left(1+x^2\right)^{\frac{n}{2}}}

517665,How far do I need to drive to find an empty parking spot?,"A parking lot consists of an infinite row of bays.  Cars arrive at random intervals (mean interval $T_a$) and stay for a random time (mean stay $T_s$).  The time intervals are memoryless (negative exponential distribution).  An arriving car parks in bay $n$, which is the first available bay.  What is the distribution of $n$? The question is motivated by the following annoyance: why is it that, when I meet someone at the airport, I always end up driving to the far end of the lot? Here is a bit more information, based on simulation.  The ratio of the times, rather than their actual values, determines the behaviour.  Thus we can write $k=T_s/T_a$ and use $k$ as the single parameter.  If $k=1$, the parking lot can be small (two bays are usually enough), and the distribution is interesting only for large values of $k$.  E.g., cars arrive every $2$ minutes and stay for $2$ hours. The first bay is the one most likely to be free (!).  However, for large $k$, the distribution is almost flat, falling off rapidly after $k$ bays and therefore having a mean of $k/2$.  In fact, I conjecture that $\mu \rightarrow k/2$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. Thanks,

Then there is a subsequence $\{f_{\hat n(i)}(m)\}^\infty_{i = 1}$ so that for each fixed $m$,  the sequence $f_{\hat n(i)}(m)$ converges as $i \to \infty$. I was wondering whether the uniform bound is actually necessary. I am not sure where it is essential in the proof, outlined below: Consider the sequence $f_n(1)$. It is a bounded set of numbers, so we can find a subsequence $f_{n(i)}$ such that $f_{n_1(i)}(1) \to f_\infty(1)$, for some number $f_\infty(1)$. Now consider the sequence $f_{n_1(i)}(2)$. We can find a subsequence $f_{n_2(i)}(2) \to f_\infty(2)$ as $i \to \infty$. Proceeding inductively, we find successive subsequences $f_{n_k(i)}$ so that $f_{n_{k+1}(i)}$ is a subsequence of $f_{n_k(i)}$, and $f_{n_k(i)} \to f_\infty(k)$ as $i \to \infty$. Thus, in particular, $f_{n_k(i)}(j) \to f_\infty(j)$ as $i \to \infty$ for $j = 1,2,\dots,k$. To get a subsequence $f_{\hat n(i)}$ converging for each $j$, take the diagonal sequence $\hat n(k) = n_k(k)$. Then $f_{\hat n(k)}, f_{\hat n(k+1)}, \dots$ is a subsequence of $f_{n_k(i)}$ so $f_{\hat n(i)}(k) \to f_\infty(k)$ as $i \to \infty$ for each $k$.","['functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The family $\{A_i:i\in I\}$ is referred to as the partiton of the set $A$. Does this imply that all of the elements of a partition on the set $A$ are pairwise disjoint? Also, is it true that the union over every element of $\{A_i:i\in I\}$ is equal to $A$? Also, a quick question on notation, when we write a union in the form $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i$ do we mean that we take the union for all $i$ in $I$? Or, we take the union for any $i$ in $I$ not necessarily every $i$?",['elementary-set-theory']

518179,A strange characterization of connected spaces,"Let $X$ be a topological space. Recall that an open cover $\mathcal U$ of $X$ is point finite if every point of $X$ is contained in finitely many elements of $\mathcal U$. Let us say that a point finite open cover $\mathcal U$ is fair if any two points of $X$ are contained in the same number of elements of $\mathcal U$. Let us call a space unfair , if the only fair covers of $X$ are the trivial covers $\mathcal U = \{X\}$ and $\mathcal U = \{X, \emptyset\}$. Question: Is it true that $X$ is connected if and only if it is unfair? If $X$ is not connected, say $X= U \cup V$, with $U, V$ disjoint and nonempty, then $\{U, V\}$ is a nontrivial fair cover of $X$. This establishes one side of the implication. What about the other implication?","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"
518192,How to calculate where a line through the earth will exit,"If we assume that it is possible to dig a hole through the earth, how can we calculate exactly where the hole would exit the earth if we know ....
1) The point of entry (gps coords)
2) The angle of entry
3) The direction of entry So if a hole was dug with an entry point of  51.50360, -0.11959, in the direction of 0 degrees (north) at an angle of 45 degrees (straight down = 90 degrees), how can I figure out where on the planet the exit to the hole will be? Any ideas? If anyone can help with even a better way of asking the question, key words to use on Google, or related reading that might help me solve this I would appreciate it. So far I have found a few sites which talk about chords through the earth and euclidean distance. But they all seem to start from the basis of knowing the point of entry and exit to work out the euclidean distance. I only know the point of entry, angle of entry and direction of entry and need to calculate the exit (..and distance would be a nice extra).",['geometry']
518202,What is the codimension of matrices of rank $r$ as a manifold?,"I'm reading through G&P's Differential Topology book, but I hit a wall at the end of section 4. There is a result stating The set $X=\{A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{R}):\mathrm{rk}(A)=r\}$ is a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with codimension $(m-r)(n-r)$. There is a suggestion: Let $A\in M_{m\times n}(\mathbb{R})$ have form
$$
A=\begin{pmatrix} B & C \\ D & E\end{pmatrix}
$$
where $B$ is an invertible $r\times r$ matrix. Then right multiply by
$$
\begin{pmatrix} I & -BC^{-1} \\ 0 & I \end{pmatrix}
$$
and show $\mathrm{rk}(A)=r$ iff $E-DB^{-1}C=0$. I multiplied out and got the matrix
$$
M:=\begin{pmatrix} B & 0 \\ D & E-DB^{-1}C\end{pmatrix}.
$$ Since I multiplied by a nonsingular matrix, I know that $\mathrm{rk}(A)=\mathrm{rk}(M)$. If $E-DB^{-1}C=0$, then 
$$
M=\begin{pmatrix} B & 0 \\ D & 0 \end{pmatrix}
$$
has rank $r$, so $A$ has rank $r$. For the converse, if $A$ has rank $r$, then $M$ has rank $r$, so by performing row operations, $M$ is row equivalent to a matrix of the form
$$
\begin{pmatrix} I_r & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
$$
This would imply $E-DB^{-1}C$ is row equivalent to $0$, and I think this implies $E-DB^{-1}C=0$. My main concern is then, how does this approach imply $\mathrm{codim}(X)=(m-r)(n-r)$?

518205,The convergence of a sequence of sets,"A sequence $\{A_n : n=0,1,2,...\}$ is said to be monotone nondecreasing if we have

To specify the type of convergence, for a monotone nondecreasing sequence of set we write we write $\{A_{n}\}\uparrow A$, likewise for a monotone nonincreasing sequence we write $\{A_{n}\}\downarrow A$. I am confused by the notation, does the latter statement about convergence imply that $\bigcup \{A_n\}=A$? Or, does it only mean that the as $n\to\infty$ the $n$-th element of $\{A_n\}$ will get closer and closer to the some set $A$ (not necessarily $\bigcup\{A_n\}$) but it will never be equal to $A$ because the sequence is infinite?","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
518216,Why does Munkres define functions in a seemingly complicated way?,"In Munkres's extremely careful and well-written textbook, Topology (2nd Edition) , he defines functions as follows. First he defines a rule of assignment as a subset of a cartesian product $r\subset C\times D$ where each element of $C$ appears as the first coordinate of at most one ordered pair belonging to $C\times D$. The domain and image set of $r$ are then defined as the set of all first coordinates and all all second coordinates of $r$ respectively. Finally, a function is defined to be a rule of assignment together with a set $B$ that contains the image set of $r$. $B$ is called the range of $f$, and the function is finally denoted by $f\colon A\to B$ if $A$ is the domain of $f$. Thus a function is defined by first taking a relation in $C\times D$, shrinking $C$ to the domain $A$, shrinking $D$ to the image set, and then enlarging the image set to a possibly different (from $D$) set $B$. This seems very complicated to me. I don't see what the relevance is of introducing the sets $C$ and $D$ to begin with. A much more natural definition would be simply that a function $f\colon A\to B$ is a relation $r\subset A\times B$ such that every $a\in A$ is the first coordinate of exactly one ordered pair. I know Munkres did this for a reason, but I have not located where in the book he uses the more elaborate definition. I know many readers of math.stackexchange are pretty familiar with Munkres's book, so I wonder if anyone has any insight as to why the more complicated definition is useful. Edit: As Asal Beag Dubh suggested, I want to emphasize that my question is what is the point of introducing $C$ and $D$ instead of sticking with $A$ and $B$.",['general-topology']

518279,"Building Bayesian Networks, Causality and Cyclic Reasoning","I am studying Bayesian Statistics and I am trying to get a good understanding on Bayesian Networks, which seems to be vital in order to make something useful in Machine Learning. Most of the texts I am reading just say simply that: ""Vertices are variables and arcs are independence relations"" and then build a whole bunch of complex stuff like d-separation, inference by message passing algorithms, etc. over this very superficial definition of the fundamental logic behind the Bayesian Networks. I still did not gain an intuition about how the ""independence relations"" are built into a Bayesian Network, to begin with. We have a bunch of variables describing a random process, which is OK. Then we build the structure of the graph, which is where I am getting lost. First of all, when we have the variables $V={X_1,X_2,...,X_n}$, according to the Chain Rule of Probability we have $n!$ alternatives to build the factorization of $P(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$ like $P(X_5)P(X_8|X_5)P(X_{12}|X_8,X_5),...$ So how can one select an ordering among these $n!$ alternatives? People talk about causality, like choosing the ""causes"" of an effect and making them the parents of the ""effect"" variable. But if we are sure that $X_i$ is the cause of $X_j$, still, for some chain rule orderings we can get a term like $P(X_i|X_j,...)$ which implies us that the ""effect"" $X_j$ acts incorrectly as the ""cause"" $X_i$. So, doesn't this conflict with the ""causality"" principle of a Bayesian Network? An another issue is with the notion of the ""Cyclic Reasoning"". Let's think of a hypothetical machine consisting of two parallel plates which rub together. We think of three variables ""Heat"", ""Plate Area Expansion"" and ""Friction"". Plate Area Expansion is the effect of the cause ""Heat"" and ""Friction"" is just the effect of the plate area expansion, in turn. This means a graph with ""Heat"" -> ""Expansion"" -> ""Friction"". But in reality, ""Friction"" is also a cause of the ""Heat"". We cannot draw an arc from ""Friction"" to ""Heat"" since this violates the Directed Acyclic Graph structure by creating a cycle. So, how does the Bayesian Network handle such kinds of ""circularity""? What if our causality assumptions cannot be represented by a Bayesian Network, like in the above sample with ""Friction"" ?","['machine-learning', 'statistics', 'graph-theory', 'bayesian-network', 'probability']"

518323,The definition of locally Lipschitz,"Marsden's Elementary Classical Analysis seems to indicate this definition: A function $f:A{\subset}\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m$ is locally Lipschitz if for each $x_0{\in}A,$ there exist constants $M{>}0$ and $\delta_0{>}0$ such that $$||x-x_0||<\delta_0\implies||f(x)-f(x_0)||\leq M||x-x_0||.$$ Here's a scan of the first edition of the text, where the only change from the second (latest) edition referred to above is that the last sentence now reads ""This is called the local Lipschitz property"" (emphasis mine). Two questions: Is the correct inequality $M\geq 0$ or $M>0$ ? Does $M$ depend on $x_0$ , like $\delta_0$ seems to? EDIT :  After pondering further, I've revised the definition to this: A function $f:A{\subset}\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m$ is locally Lipschitz at $x_0{\in}A$ if there exist constants $\delta{>}0$ and $M{\in}\mathbb R$ such that for each $x{\in}A,$ $$||x-x_0||<\delta\implies||f(x)-f(x_0)||\leq M||x-x_0||.$$ Unlike regular/global Lipschitz, local Lipschitz can be defined at a point, and implies pointwise continuity.","['normed-spaces', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'lipschitz-functions']"
518338,"baby rudin 2.33, relative compactness","my question is relative to baby rudin theorem 2.33 which states; $$ \ suppose \  K \subset Y \subset X.  \ then\  K \ is\  compact\  relative \ to\  X \ iff\  K\  is\  compact\  relative \ to \ Y.$$ honestly, i think i only have  maybe a superficial understanding of what Rudin is even saying here.  however, i become more uncertain in his proof. 
i would say that i feel i have a pretty good understanding of theorem 2.30, the preceding theorem, which says $$ suppose \ Y \subset X. a \ subset \ E \ of \ Y \ is \ open \ relative \ to \ Y \ iff \  \  E = Y \bigcap G  \ for \ some \ open \ subset \ G \ of \ X.$$ which, as i understand the idea of openness as $E \subset Y$ may be open in $Y$ but may not be open in $X$ where $E \subset Y \subset X$. also i feel pretty comfortable with the idea of a compact set as being one where it is a subset of a finite union of a family of sets, the finite subcover.  compared to a general open cover, which is just a union of any family of open sets, which is a superset of some other set which it is the open cover for. now that i have explained the relative parts of what i do (think) i understand, let me clarify what about theorem 2.33 i am uncomfortable with; i really am not sure what it even means for sets to be compact relative to another set.  in the topological sense, is compactness not a invariant property of a topological space? Rudin proceeds on with the proof as follows; suppose $K$ is compactive relative to $X$, and let $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ be a collection of sets, open relative to $Y$, such that $K\subset \bigcup_{\alpha} V_{\alpha}$. this is the first part of the proof i am confused by.  $K$ is assumed to be compact relative to $X$ but Rudin describes $K$ as being covered by $V_{\alpha}$, where $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ is an open subset of $Y$.  would not $K$ being covered by a family of sets, subsets of $X$, follow immediately from the fact that $K$ is compact relative to $X$? i dont understand the motivation for this part. carrying on for the moment. By theorem 2.30 there are sets $G_{\alpha}$, open relative to $X$, such that $V_{\alpha}=Y \bigcap G_{\alpha}$, for all $\alpha$; and since $K$ is compact relative to $X$ we have $$(22) \  K \subset G_{\alpha_1} \bigcup ..... \bigcup G_{\alpha_n}$$  for finitely many indices $\alpha_1,...\alpha_n$ which i dont argue with any of. since $K \subset Y$, (22) implies $$ (23) \ K \subset V_{\alpha_1} \bigcup ... \bigcup V_{\alpha_n} $$.  and this proves $K$ is compact relative to $Y$. this is the last part i dont understand, how does $K$ being a subset of $Y$ force (22) to imply (23)? of course this is only one direction in the bijection, but i was so bothered by the theorem/proof i havent even gotten to the second part of the bijection.","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"
