1422244,Sum of two harmonic alternating series,"Evaluate the series $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{2n+1}{n(n+1)}.$$ I've simplified it to the form $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n+1} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\frac{1}{n}$$
 and I've proved that both parts converge. However, I'm having trouble finding the limit. Writing out the terms as $(1+\frac 1 2 - \frac 1 2 + \frac 1 3 - \frac 1 3 ... )$ suggest their sum is one. However when I look up the sums of the two parts, they are $-\ln(2)$ and $\ln(2)$ respectively, which suggests the sum of the overall series is $0$. I'm aware that if a series is not absolutely convergent then its terms can be rearranged to converge to any number, but we haven't covered that topic yet so I feel like that shouldn't be a consideration in solving this.","['analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"
1422255,Stirling approximation note,During my study to Stirling approximation I find this formula  $n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi  n}  n^{n}e^{-n} $ but we know that  $ 0!  =1 $ And in this formula if we replace every  $ n $ with  $ 0$ we will have $ 0^0$ which is undefined.  My question is how we get  $0! $ by using this formula? ..  can anyone explain that for me.  I'll appreciate that..  thanks,['calculus']
1422261,"Contour Integral solution to differential equations, Euler transformation?","The book Spain, B. and Smith, M. G., Functions of Mathematical Physics , Volume 81, Volume 8 of New university mathematics series , Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1970,  introduces the contour integral method of solving ODEs. The baseic idea is: given an ODE $\sum_0^m a_r(t) \frac {d^rf}{dt^r} = 0$ , a solution may be sought after in the form: $$ \int_c{k(z,t)v(t)dt} $$ The ingenuity is really in the choice of $k$ and a contour can then be chosen to make sure 'boundary terms' vanish. The apeal is of course for example in finding integral representations of special functions.
The Laplace method is when choice of $k$ is of the form $k = e^{t*h(z)}$ (in general) and we frequently end up with a Mellin inversion formula or similar looking solution after finding the solution to a much simpler problem satisfied by $v(t)$ . For example the integral representation of Airy functions. Another popular choice of $k$ is of the form $ k = (t - z)^\mu $ which is called the euler transformation. where $\mu$ is a parameter to be determined. For example, the integral representation of Gauss's hypergeometric function looks like this. For example, the nth order ODE with linear polynomial coefficients: $$ \sum_{k=0}^n {(a_k + b_kt)\frac {d^kw}{dt^k}} = 0; $$ We can try a Laplace-type choice for $k$ say $k = e^{zt}$ which upon substitution yields two polynomials in z: $F(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n{a_kz^k}$ and $G(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n{b_kz^k}$ and the ODE is tranformed to: $$ \int_c {e^{zt} v(z)(F(z)+tG(z))}dz = 0 $$ Upon integration by parts (i'll ommit the z's, primes denote differntiation wrt z): $$\int_c{e^{zt}(Fv - (Gv)^\prime)dz} + [GSe^{zt}]_{C} = 0$$ We then choose a contour that ensures the last term in the LHS above vanishes and solve the 1st order system in the parentheses in $z$ intead to find $v$ as: $$v(z) = \frac {A}{G(z)} exp\{\int^z \frac {F(z)}{G(z)} dz\}$$ for some arbitrary constant. In general tis type of choice of $k$ 'reflects the order' of the problem to be solved. For example above an nth order ODE is solved by finding a 1st order ODE that $v$ satisfies. If the order of the polynomials in $a_k,b_k$ were quadratic we would have a 2nd order ODE that $v$ satisfies thereby not have simplified the problem a great deal. This is usually when the Euler-type choice of k is useful. For example in proving the integral representation of Legendre polynomials. My long preamble is to get others interested in the elegance of this as I see it isn't very popular. My question is: Is there a more modern text that covers this method of solving ODEs?
Perhaps the name 'Euler transformation' is not the most popular name for the second choice of $k$ , if so does anyone know another name for the method?
Alternatively, does anyone know a different proof of the integral representation of Legrendre polynomials and how to show equivalence of the different types of representations?","['special-functions', 'integral-transforms', 'reference-request', 'complex-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1422305,Succinct Proof: All Pentagons Are Star Shaped,"Question: What is a succinct proof that all pentagons are star shaped? In case the term star shaped (or star convex ) is unfamiliar or forgotten: Definition Reminder: A subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is star shaped if there exists an $x \in X$ such that the line segment from $x$ to any point in $X$ is contained in $X$. This topic has arisen in the past in my class discussions around interior angle sums; specifically, for star shaped polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$ we can find their sum of interior angles as follows: By assumption, there is an interior point $x$ that can be connected to each of the $n$ vertices. Drawing in these line segments, we construct $n$ triangles; summing across all of their interior angles gives a total of $180n^\circ$, but this over-counts the angle sum for the polygon by the $360^\circ$ around $x$. Therefore, the sum of interior angles is $(180n - 360)^\circ = 180(n-2)^\circ$. This formula for the sum of interior angles holds more generally (often shown by triangulating polygons) but the proof strategy above already fails for some (obviously concave) hexagons. For example: The above depicted polygon is not star shaped. Moreover, it is a fact that any polygon with five or fewer sides is star shaped. And so I re-paste: Question: What is a succinct proof that all pentagons are star shaped? Edit: Since it has come up as a counterexample (of sorts) for each of the first two responses, here is an example of a concave pentagon that may be worth examining in thinking through a proof.","['euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'problem-solving', 'reference-request']"

Implicit assumptions: The hands rotate continuously The clocks don't overlap My try: This seems like an application of the intermediate value theorem, but I find it very hard to make my argument rigourous. Intuitively, if we extend the hour hand of the first clock infinitely, it swaps the entire second clock in some portion of the day that last less than 6 hours. During that time, surely it must meet the tip of the hour hand of the second clock. But how to prove this rigourously .",['geometry']
1422391,"Finding partial derivative of $f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$","I'm studying Mathematical Analysis II for a university course. There is a training exercise that asks me to: Find the partial derivatives at $(1,0)$ of $f(x,y)$ , where: $f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}$ when $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ and $f(x,y) = 0$ when $(x,y)= (0,0)$ So far, I've used the definition as per the other examples. For example, let's start with $f_x(a,b)=g'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h}$ Applied to my problem, I've got $f_x(1,0)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(1+h,0) - f(1,0)}{h}$ And this is where I stall.

1422399,"Other than $\setminus$ and $-$, are there any other notations for the set-theoretic difference of sets?","Let $X$ denote a set, and suppose that $B$ and $A$ are subsets thereof. Then the set-theoretic difference of $B$ and $A$ may be denoted in any of the following ways: $$B \setminus A, \qquad B - A, \qquad B \cap A^c$$ I'm not entirely happy with any of these options, however: $B \setminus A$ ""looks"" contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second, but in actuality the opposite is true. Furthermore, if $A$ and $B$ are subsets of a non-commutative monoid $M$, I like to write $B \setminus A$ for the set of all $c \in M$ such that $Bc \subseteq A$. Notice that this is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second. $B - A$ is a good option unless $X$ has an Abelian group structure, in which case there's a potential notational conflict with $\{b-a \mid b \in B, a \in A\}$. $B \cap A^c$ is a good way of proving things about set-differences algebraically, but I don't think its a good idea to get rid of a symbol for set-theoretic difference altogether. It would be like getting rid of ""$p$ if $q$"" in favor of ""$p$ or not $q$."" Although this algebraic reduction can be useful, I think it kind of undermines clarity and readability. I'm currently using $\setminus$, but I'd like to replace it with something else. The notation $A / B$ isn't a good option, because it looks like a quotient of the structure $A$ by the subobject $B$.

Other than $\setminus$ and $-$, are there any other notations for the set-theoretic difference of sets?","['computer-science', 'elementary-set-theory', 'notation', 'order-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

1422433,Two different definitions of General Measurable Function,"I've noticed two different kinds of definitions for a Measurable Function . In Folland's Real Analysis Modern Techniques : If $(X, \mathcal {M})$ and $(Y, \mathcal {N})$ are measurable spaces, a mapping $f: X \to Y$ is called $(\mathcal {M}, \mathcal {N})$-measurable , or just measurable when $\mathcal {M}$ and $\mathcal {N}$ are understood, if $f^{-1}(E) \in \mathcal {M}$ for all $E \in \mathcal {N}$. In Halmos' Measure Theory : Suppose now that in addition to the set $X$ we are given also a $\sigma$-ring $\mathcal {S}$ of subsets of $X$ so that $(X, \mathcal {S})$ is a measurable space. For every real valued (and also for every extended real valued) function $f$ on $X$ we shall write $$N(f) = \{x: f(x) \ne 0 \};$$
  if a real valued function $f$ is such that, for every Borel subset $M$ of the real line the set $N(f) \cap f^{-1}(M)$ is measurable, then $f$ is called a measurable function . I think both kinds of Measurable Function above are talking about a more general edition compared with Lebesgue measurable function. Basically, the difference between them two general measurable functions is whether singling $0$ out of codomain. Why does Halmos do such a removal? Or it is just a evolving process of measure theory from Halmos to Folland coz Folland's book comes out much later?","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1422548,"If $G$ acts on $A$ faithfully/freely/transitively, what can we say about its action on $\hat A$?","Let $A$ be a finite abelian group and let $G\subset \operatorname{Aut}A$, with $G$ acting from the left. $G$ acts in a natural way (on the left) on $A$'s character group $\hat A$ by $g\chi = \chi\circ g^{-1}$. My question is, if we know something about $G$'s action on $A$, can we say anything about its action on $\hat A$? More specifically: (1) If $G$'s action on $A\setminus\{0\}$ is free, is its action on $\hat A\setminus\{0\}$ free? (2) $G$'s action on $A$ is faithful by construction; is its action on $\hat A$ faithful? (3) If its action on $A\setminus\{0\}$ is transitive, is its action on $\hat A\setminus\{0\}$ transitive? My intuition says yes to all 3 questions, but I really do not see the argument so I have no idea whether to trust it. I think it is based on the fact that (a) $A$ and $\hat A$ are isomorphic (though not canonically), and (b) $A$ is canonically isomorphic to $\hat{\hat{A}}$, and the canonical isomorphism commutes with the action of $G$. But logically these don't imply anything. I can't extract any info from (a) unless one of the isomorphisms $A\rightarrow\hat A$ commutes with the action of $G$ on each, but usually none of them do. And (b) has nothing direct to say about $\hat A$ or $G$'s action on it. It would be enough to conclude (1), (2) and (3) if I could guarantee that there is an isomorphism $A\rightarrow\hat A$ that commutes with the action of $G$ up to twisting $G$ by some automorphism . This seems potentially plausible to me but I don't see the argument; it's true in the one case I've worked out by hand ($A=C_7$, $G=C_6 = \operatorname{Aut} A$), but there are lots of special reasons why it should be true in that case.","['abelian-groups', 'group-theory', 'representation-theory', 'group-actions']"

1422705,Help with a contradiction I found in an equation group,"The following is a homework problem but I seem to find a contradiction in it. My problem By the third equation, $\frac{{\partial u}}{{\partial t}} = f'(x + t) - g'(x - t)$, and $\frac{{\partial u}}{{\partial t}}(x,0) = f'(x) - g'(x)=0$, thus $f(x) - g(x) = C$ for some constant $C$. Note here $f'(x),g'(x)$ are differentiations with respect to $x$, not $t$. Together with the second equation, we further have $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + C - |x|)$, $g(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 - C- |x|)$. Now by the first equation, $u(1,t) = f(1 + t) + g(1 - t) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + C - |1 + t|) + \frac{1}{2}(1 - C - |1 - t|) = 0$, which gives $|1 + t| + |1 - t| = 2$.

Therefore $$\begin{align}I&=\int\frac {\sqrt{2-x-x^2}}{x^2}\ dx\\&=\int \left(\frac tx\right)\left(\frac{2t\ dt}{-\frac4{x^3}+\frac 1{x^2}}\right)\\&=\int \frac{2t^2\ dt}{\frac{x-4}{x^2}}\\&=\int \frac{2t^2(1+t^2)\ dt}{{x-4}\over{2-x}}\\&=\int \frac{2t^2(1+t^2)(5+4t^2-\sqrt{8t^2+9})\ dt}{\sqrt{8t^2+9}-(8t^2+9)}\end{align}$$ Now I substituted $8t^2+9=z^2 \implies t^2=\frac {z^2-9}8 \implies 2t\ dt=z/4\ dz$.

1423121,"Let $G$ act transitive, and $H \unlhd G$. Why is number of orbits at most $|G : H|$?","I have a question on the argument in part (2) of the following theorem (it is a shortened version of this theorem from the book Permutation Groups by Dixon & Mortimer): Theorem : Let $G$ be a group acting transitively on a set $\Omega$, and $H \unlhd G$. Then: (1) the orbits of $H$ form a system of blocks for $G$; (2) the group $H$ has at most $|G : H|$ orbits, and if the index $|G : H|$ is finite then the number of orbits of $H$ divides $|G : H|$; (3) if $G$ acts primitively on $\Omega$ then either $H$ is transitive or $H$ lies in the kernel of the action. The proof of (2) just notes: This follows at once from (1) since all blocks in a system of blocks have the same size. The proof (3) is a similar short note, but there it is totally clear to me, but for (2) why it could be readily seen by (1)? The arguments I found in the finite case are a little bit more involved: By orbit-stabilizer and as they all have the same size their common size is $|H : H_{\alpha}|$ for some $\alpha \in \Omega$ and $|\Omega| = k \cdot |H : H_{\alpha}|$ where $k$ denotes the number of orbits. Further as $G$ acts transitively $|\Omega| = |G : G_{\alpha}|$, and also we have $|G : H_{\alpha}| = |G:H|\cdot |H:H_{\alpha}|$ and with $H_{\alpha} \le G_{\alpha}$ also $|G:H_{\alpha}| = |G:G_{\alpha}||G_{\alpha}:H_{\alpha}|$.
Putting all this 
together we have
$$
 \frac{|G:H_{\alpha}|}{|G_{\alpha}:H_{\alpha}|} = k \cdot \frac{|G:H_{\alpha}|}{|G:H|}
$$ 
hence $|G:H| = k \cdot |G_{\alpha} : H_{\alpha}|$. But the arguments above are just valid if the involved indices are finite, and besides being not simply seen at once, what is the simple argument that (2) follows at once from (1), and how is this applied in the infinite case?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'group-actions', 'permutations']"

Another way I though about it was we have 7 total items, one group of 3 and one of four. 7!/4! would drop all permutations of the group of 4 which would be a sort of parallel to having 3 items in 7 spaces where we care about the order.

We know every TM fits either one of those sets, and $P \cup Q = TM$. But we also know that we can't always decide, given a particular TM, if it is in $P$ or in $Q$: that is the undecidable Halting Problem . Now have this set $H = \{\text{Haltable}, \text{Unhaltable}\}$, does the following function ""exists""? $$

Let $\mathcal {A}$ be a $\pi$ -system that contains $\Omega$ and let $\mathcal {H}$ be a collection of real-valued functions that satisfies: (i) If $A ∈ \mathcal {A}$ , then $1_A ∈ \mathcal {H}$ . (ii) If $f, g ∈ \mathcal {H}$ , then $f + g$ , and $cf ∈ \mathcal {H}$ for any real number $c$ . (iii) If $f_n ∈ \mathcal {H}$ are nonnegative and increase to a bounded function $f$ , then $f ∈ \mathcal {H}$ . Then $\mathcal {H}$ contains all bounded functions measurable with respect to $\sigma (\mathcal {A})$ . Proof. The assumption $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$ , (ii), and (iii) imply that $\mathcal {G} = \{A : 1_A ∈ \mathcal {H}\}$ is a $\lambda$ -system so by (i) and the $\pi − \lambda$ theorem, Theorem 2.1.2, $\mathcal {G} ⊃ \sigma(A)$ . (ii) implies $\mathcal{H}$ contains all simple functions, and (iii) implies that $\mathcal{H}$ contains all bounded measurable functions. I can't understand one sentence from the proof, ""(ii) implies $\mathcal{H}$ contains all simple functions"". Why? P.S. I think ""measurable with respect to $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ "" means $\sigma(\mathcal {A})$ -measurable. I know $\mathcal{F}$ -measurable mapping that is suppose $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ and $(E, \mathcal{E})$ are two measurable spaces, $f$ is a mapping from $\Omega \to E$ . $f$ is a $\mathcal{F}$ -measurable mapping if $f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{F}$ for $\forall A \in \mathcal{E}$ . So $\sigma(\mathcal {A})$ -measurable probably means those $f: (\Omega, \sigma (\mathcal{A})) \to ([0, +\infty), \mathcal{B}{[0, +\infty)})$ where $\mathcal{B}{[0, +\infty)}$ denotes Borel $\sigma$ -algebra on $[0, +\infty)$ . Update: The author didn't make the sentence clear. So I try to make it a little bit more complete. Let $\forall f$ is $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ -measurable. I suppose $g_n =\sum_{k=0}^{n2^n -1} \frac{k}{2^n} I_{\{\frac{k}{2^n} \le f^+ ＜ \frac{k+1}{2^n}\}} + n I_{f^+ \ge n}$ where $f^+ = f ∨ 0$ . Then $g_n \in \mathcal{H}$ coz $f$ is $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ -measurable that is $\{x: \frac{k}{2^n} \le f^+ ＜ \frac{k+1}{2^n} \} \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ and $\{x: f^+ \ge n\} \in \sigma(\mathcal{A})$ . Then $g_n$ increasingly converges to $f^+$ and so does $f^-$ . $f = f^+ - f^- \in \mathcal{H}$ . Please note that I can only get simple functions defined on $\{x: \frac{k}{2^n} \le f^+ ＜ \frac{k+1}{2^n} \}$ and $\{x: f^+ \ge n\}$ are in $\mathcal{H}$ .

1423467,Calculating angles neccessary to reach a position on a 2D plane for two robot arms in a row,"I ran into a problem I am unable to solve while constructing a simplish robot with two arms connected in a row. It is simple to find what point the arms will reach given the angles. Lengths of the arms $a, b$ are constant. Angles $\alpha, \beta$ are variables. $$\begin{align}
x &= a\cos(\alpha ) + b\cos(\alpha + \beta)\\
y &= a\sin(\alpha ) + b\sin(\alpha + \beta)
\end{align}$$ I would like to calculate the opposite of this: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ given $x$ and $y$. I believe this can have 0-2 solutions, but that is about as far as I got.

1423553,Polar to Rectangular Coordinates,"Problem:
Transform the following equation from polar to rectangular coordinates.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho &=& \frac{2}{1 - \cos \theta} \\
\end{eqnarray*} Answer: Recall that:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho &=& {(x^2+y^2)} ^ {\frac{1}{2}} \\
\cos \theta &=&  \frac{x}{\rho} =\frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \\
\end{eqnarray*}
This gives us:
\begin{eqnarray*}
{(x^2+y^2)}^{\frac{1}{2}} &=& \frac{2}{1 - \frac{x}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}}} \\
2 &=& {(x^2+y^2)^\frac{1}{2}} - x \\
x + 2 &=& (x^2+y^2)^\frac{1}{2} \\
(x + 2)^2 &=& x^2+y^2 \\
x^2 + 4x + 4 &=& x^2+y^2 \\
4x + 4 &=& y^2 \\
y^2 &=& 4x + 4

However, the book gets:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y^2 &=& 4(x + 2)

I can solve this problem with addition: By assuming $x<y$, we have $89$ possibilities for $y$ when $x=1$, and $88$ possibilities for $y$ when $x=2$, and so forth. This leads to the solution $$89+88+\dots+1=\frac{90\cdot89}{2}$$ However, since

1423662,Regarding $\mathscr{O}_X$ Modules and stalks,"Suppose that we have a topological space $X$ together with a sheaf of rings $\mathscr{O}_x$ such that for a sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ of abelian groups  we can define a $\mathscr{O}_x$ module. Can the $\mathscr{O}_X$ module be interpreted as a natural transformation $\mathscr{O}_X \times \mathscr{F} \implies \mathscr{F}$? In that case where's the product being taken? Are we considering both as sheaves : $X \rightarrow Set$? When we take the stalk of $\mathscr{F}_p$ the equivalence relation defined depends on the nature of the maps? I mean even if we have a sheaf of abelian groups the nature of the stalk is just set theorical? I was trying to prove that the stalk $\mathscr{F}_p$ was naturally a $\mathscr{O}_{X,p}$ module using the universal property. Suppose we take the colimit of the product $\mathscr{O}_X \times \mathscr{F}$ that would be $\mathscr{O}_{X,p} \times \mathscr{F}_p$ Given $\mathscr{O}_X(U) \times \mathscr{F}(U) \rightarrow \mathscr{F}(U)\rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p$ by the universal property of the colimit  there should be a unique map :$\mathscr{O}_{X,p} \times \mathscr{F}_p \rightarrow \mathscr{F}_p$ with the desired commuting properties.

My professor's lecture notes have proved an interval of type $(a,b]$ where $a,b\in\Bbb R,a<b$ is connected. The proof is long and tricky. Now I want to use the fact that $(a,b]$ is connected to prove $(a,b)$ is connected. Assume $(a,b)$ is not connected, then $\exists G_1,G_2$ which are open sets in $\tau_{(a,b)}$ st. $(a,b)=G_1\bigcup G_2$ and $G_1\bigcap G_2=\emptyset$. 
  Since $b=\sup(a,b)$, then either $b=\sup G_1$ or $b=\sup G_2$. Without loss of generality, suppose $b=\sup G_1$. If we can show $G_1\bigcup\{b\}\in\tau _{(a,b]}$, then $(G_1\bigcup\{b\})\bigcup G_2=(a,b]$ and $G_1\bigcup\{b\}$,$G_2$ are disjoint open sets in $\tau _{(a,b]}$, which is a contradiction with the fact that $(a,b]$ is connected. However, I have tried but was not able to prove $G_1\bigcup\{b\}\in\tau _{(a,b]}$. Can anyone help with a proof of this or there is another way to show $(a,b)$ is connected?
