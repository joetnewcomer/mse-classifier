812089,$\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is invertible implies $D$ is locally principal,"With words added for context, 14.2.G of Ravil Vakil's notes asks Suppose $X$ is an integral, normal and Noetherian scheme, and $D$ a Weil divisor. Let $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ be the quasicoherent sheaf defined by 
\begin{align*}
\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X(D)) :=\{t\in K(X)^{\times}: {\rm div}|_U t + D|_U\geq 0\}\cup \{0\}\}.

Suppose in addition that $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is invertible. (a) Let $s$ be the rational section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ corresponding to the function $1\in K(X)$ in the defintion above. Show that ${\rm div}(s)=D$. (To clarify what $s$ is, we can see that 1 is a section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ away from the support of $D$. If referring to it as ""1"" is confusing, Vakil uses the notation $\sigma(1)$, where $\sigma$ takes $f\in K(X)$ and outputs a rational section. More generally, if $f\in K(X)$, then $\sigma(f)$ is a section of $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ away from the poles of $f$ and the support of $D$. We can compute the divisor of $\sigma(f)$ by taking local trivializations.) (b) Show that $D$ is locally principal. I think I see how (a) and (b) are equivalent, and I have tried to do (b) directly by taking an open set $U$ over which $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ is trivial, and fixing an isomorphism $\mathcal{O}_X|_U\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(D)|_U$. Then, we can let $s$ be the image of 1, and try to get a contradiction if ${\rm div}(s)|_U>-D|_U$ by finding a section that is not a multiple of $s$. For example, if given an integral, noetherian, and normal ring $A$, a height 1 prime is never contained in the union of the remaining height 1 primes, I think this approach can work. However, I think I am just missing something obvious. How do we prove (a) directly, as the exercise intends?

One of the domains was $[1,5]$ and I plugged into the x of the original function $1$, $\dfrac{1}{2}\cos^{-1}(-\dfrac{1}{2})$, $5$, and found out that $1$ was the minimum and $5$ was the maximum with the resulting values of $1.909297427$ and $4.455978889$, respectively.

$$u(0,x) = u_0(x)$$
$$u_t(0,x) = u_1(x)$$ Hadamard showed that this problem is ill-posed : there exist large solutions with arbitrarily small initial data. For instance, if we take $u(t,x) = a_{\omega} \sinh(\omega t) \sin(\omega x)$, then $u_0(x) = 0$ and $u_1(x) = a_{\omega} \omega \sin (\omega x)$, then we can make $u(t,x)$ grow arbitrarily fast while keeping $u_0$ and $u_1$ small. Tweaking this construction, it is not hard to see that for any given $k$ and $\epsilon > 0$, we can construct initial data such that $$
||u_0||_{\infty} + ||u_0^{(1)}||_{\infty} + \ldots + ||u_0^{(k)}||_{\infty} + ||u_1||_{\infty} + ||u_1^{(1)}||_{\infty} + \ldots + ||u_1^{(k)}||_{\infty} < \epsilon

812434,Maximal area covered by two triangles in unit circle,"What is the maximal area covered by two triangles in a unit circle? There are no restrictions other than that. They can overlap, touch the circle, not touch the circle etc. So far I have shown In an optimal solution all six vertices have to lie on the unit circle. If the two triangles are not overlapping, the optimal solution has area $2$ . Using two equilateral triangles, the maximal area is $\sqrt 3\approx 1.7320508$ . Explanations AD 1: This is true since any triangle with not all vertices touching the unit circle will be entirely contained in a larger triangle where all three vertices lie on the unit circle. AD 2: The optimal non-overlapping solution is a square formed by two triangles meeting in a diameter of the circle. This can be derived from a few simple principles: (a) Given a triangle with all vertices on the unit circle we can always increase the area by fixing two vertices using their distance as base and then move the third vertex to the middle of the circular segment between the other two to maximize the height with out changing the base. This makes optimal non-overlapping solutions consist of isosceles triangles. (b) Any non-overlapping triangle contained within one half  of the circle can be enlarged by a parallel displacement of one side until it either meets the diameter of the circle or a side of the other triangle. This effectively makes the two triangles share one side so they form a 4-gon. (c) The optimal 4-gon with vertices on a circle is a square which can be obtained by applying principle (a) four times namely to each of the triangles formed by dividing the 4-gon by a diagonal. So the optimal non-overlapping solution will be an inscribed square of area $2$ . AD 3: I wrote a ""dirty"" equation for the area as a function of the radian distance between a vertex from each triangle and found that the area was maximized when the six vertices where evenly spread out forming a hexagram (star of David). Remark I suspect the optimal solution is actually $2$ so that the triangles do not need to overlap. In other words, we gain nothing from allowing the triangles to overlap, if I am right. I hope someone can provide a nice and clear way to either prove or disprove this conjecture.","['optimization', 'geometry', 'triangles', 'circles']"

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold with a $(G,X)$-structure, i.e. an atlas made of charts with values in $X$ and transition maps from $G$.

The first holonomy does not obviously give a representation of the fundamental group: for example it is not invariant under homotopy of the paths.

813357,Pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions,"Unfortunately my analysis lecturer, as awesome as he is, lacks the structure in his lessons to provide worked out proofs for us to use as guidelines for proving other things. Hence, I am having a great deal of trouble proving this question (or even knowing what/how to prove). Question : Show that a sequence $\left\{ f_{n}\right\} _{n=0}^{\infty}$ of functions which converges uniformly to the function $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$ converges pointwise to $f$ on that interval. So far... I know that a sequence of functions converges uniformly if: For $\forall \varepsilon>0$ $\exists N$ s.t $\forall x$ and $n \geq N$, we have $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|< \varepsilon$ (Thank you wiki) So, in order to show pointwise convergence, I need to show $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_{n}(x)=f(x)$ for every $x$. I can clearly see that from the definition of uniform convergence, if my $n$ is tending to infinity, that is clearly an $n \geq N$, hence if I was to take: $|f_{n}(x)-f(x)|< \varepsilon \implies -\varepsilon<f_{n}(x)-f(x)< \varepsilon$ But $\varepsilon > 0$, so: $f_{n}(x)-f(x)< \varepsilon \implies f_{n}(x)<f(x)+ \varepsilon$ But if I consider that, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, hence could I say: $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f_{n}(x)=f(x)$ Hence the sequence is pointwise convergent to $f$. Problem: I feel like I'm missing steps, or logical connections, yet I'm at a loss to fill them. I feel like my basic idea is at least close to sound, but as I said, I may just be looking at the similarities and saying ""It's clearly evident"", but with more work. Would greatly appreciate a critique and aide, as we don't get a great deal of feedback or particular teaching on proofs - literally, our lecturer is great, but he tends to scrawl proofs rather vaguely, leaving out much of the ""self evident"" or ""obvious"" connections.

813427,"Is there a concept of a ""free Hilbert space on a set""?","I am looking for a ""good"" definition of a Hilbert space with a distinct orthonormal basis (in the Hilbert space sense) such that each basis element corresponds to an element of a given set $X$. Before I explain my attempt for a definition of this, let me talk about something analogous. Analogy: There exists something analogous for vector spaces, namely the free vector space on the set $X$ . This is a vector space $V(X)$ with a distinct basis such that every basis element corresponds to an element of $X$. More precisely, a free vector space on $X$ is a vector space $V(X)$, together with a map $i: X \rightarrow V(X)$ such that the following universal property is satisfied: For every vector space $W$ (over the same field) and every map $\phi: X \rightarrow W$, there is a unique linear map $\psi: V(X) \rightarrow W$ such that $\phi = \psi \circ i$. For such a free vector space over $X$, the set $i(X) = \{i(x) \mid x \in X\}$ is a basis of $V(X)$ such that each element of the basis corresponds to an element of $X$. I heard that one calls $V(X)$ the free vector space because $V(X)$ free object on $X$ , but I don't fully understand this concept. Let's restrict to complex vector spaces. For a given set $X$, one can construct a free vector space on $X$ as follows: One takes the set $V(X)$ of functions $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with finite support, endowed with pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. This is a vector space with the Kronecker delta functions $\delta_x$ (which evaluate to 1 on $x$ and to zero elsewhere) as a basis. Then $V(X)$, together with the map $i: X \rightarrow V(X), \ x \mapsto \delta_x$ is a free vector space on $X$. My attempt: Inspired by the above construction of a free vector space on a set $X$, I want to define a free Hilbert space on $X$. Again, let's restrict to complex Hilbert spaces. For a given set $X$, let $\mathcal{H}(X)$ be the set of functions $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with countable support such that $\sum_{x \in \text{supp}(f)} \vert f(x) \vert^2 < \infty$, endowed with pointwise addition and scalar multiplication and the inner product $\langle f, g \rangle = \sum_{x \in \text{supp}(f) \cap \text{supp}(g)} f(x) \overline{g(x)}$. In other words, set $\mathcal{H}(X) := \ell^2(X)$. This is a Hilbert space where the Kronecker delta functions $\delta_x$ for $x \in X$ form an orthonormal basis. Let $i: X \rightarrow \mathcal{H}(X)$ be the map $x \mapsto \delta_x$. My question: Is this a ""good"" definition of a free Hilbert space on a set $X$? Does it satisfy a universal property analogous to the one for free vector spaces? Is this a ""Hilbert space with a distinct orthonormal basis such that each basis element corresponds to an element of $X$""? What makes me skeptical is the fact that I found a document on the functor $\ell^2$ in which it is said that ""The important $\ell^2$–construction is in many ways the closest thing there is to a free Hilbert space"" (page 1) but also ""Lemma 4.8 showed that $\ell^2(X)$ is not the free Hilbert space on X, at least not in the categorically accepted meaning.""

However, I don't really understand the definition or why this is the way to look at it topologically.
Visually speaking, I mostly have trouble picturing blow-ups of product manifolds or generally ""complicated"" ones, as opposed to blowing up a single point which is usually the most basic given example. Also, I know there is an analogous idea in algebraic geometry and that it is discussed in several threads on MSE, but my background in algebraic geometry is very basic so I'd like to understand the concept in as topological/differential terms as possible.

I already struggled to even come up with a non abelian Banach algebra. The only two examples I could think of were matrix groups and the space of bounded linear oeprators. (are there any more?) From there I went on to think about matrix groups since it seemed to promise a simpler example. I was trying to use the determinant as an isomorphism: if you start with the general linear group and note that the special linear group is a subgroup (they're all rings, really) then the determinant is a surjective homomorphism from the general linear group into $\mathbb C \setminus \{0\}$. To  make it into an isomorphism one can quotient the general linear group by the special linear group (the special linear group is the kernel). But the problem with this idea is that once the domain is a quotient (set of equivalence classes) the map doesn't seem to be well-defined anymore: if $A$ has determinant $a$ and $B$ has determinant $1$ then $\mathrm{det}(A + B)$ should equal $\mathrm{det}(A)$ since the two matrices differ by an element of the special linear group. On the other hand, since $\mathrm{det}$ is a homomorphism, $\mathrm{det}(A + B)$ should equal $\mathrm{det}(A)+\mathrm{det}(B) = \mathrm{det}(A)+1$. What am I doing wrong here? Then I started to wonder about why they should be closed ideals. I know that a maximal ideal in a Banach algebra is closed but the converse does probably not hold. So what's the significance of closedness here? Edit Apparently I was on the right track. If you look here at example 3.1.1. then matrix algebras can be show to have no nonzero proper two sided ideals. Would that be enough for an example or can a matrix algebra still have a one sided closed proper ideal?","['ideals', 'banach-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"

We can easily show that one cannot accomplish walking to infinity using steps of bounded length on the real line using primes in $\mathbb{R}$. For an arbitrary natural number $k$, consider the $k-1$ consecutive numbers $$
k! + 2, k! + 3, \ldots k! + k,
$$
all of which are composite. This is another way of saying there are arbitrarily large gaps in the primes. For the Gaussian primes, there is computational proof that a moat of length $\sqrt{26}$ exists, so one cannot walk to infinity using steps of length $5$. Erdos is said to have conjectured that it is impossible to complete the walk. Percolation theory also suggests that the walk is impossible, though to my understanding this heuristic assumes the primes are completely independent in some way. Eisenstein integers are numbers of the form $a+b\omega$, with $a$, $b \in \mathbb{R}$, where $\omega = \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\pi/3}$. My first and main question is - What is the current lower bound for step size in the analogous problem for Eisenstein primes? Quaternions with all integer components are called Lipshitz integers. So let us call primes over this ring Lipshitz primes. A Lipshitz integer is only a Lipshitz prime if its norm is a prime. Is anything known about the moat problem over $\mathbb{H}$? One might think that given the extra dimensions or degrees of freedom walking to infinity should be easier, however I'm not sure how rare Lipshitz primes are.
