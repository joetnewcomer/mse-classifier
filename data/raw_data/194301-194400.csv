3733276,What is the true status of the Lehmer totient problem?,"The Lehmer-totient problem : For a prime number $\ n\ $ we have $\ \varphi(n)=n-1\ $ . In particular, we have $\ \varphi(n) \mid n-1\ $ . Is there a composite number $\ n\ $ with $\ \varphi(n)\mid n-1\ $ ? It can easily be shown that such a number must be a Carmichael number. What is the real status of this problem ? I found some pages in the internet claiming a proof, but neither Wikipedia nor Mathworld consider this
problem to be solved. The best lower bound is claimed to be $10^{22}$ in Mathworld, but Wikipedia still gives $10^{20}$ as the best bound. Which is true ? And is the problem solved or not ?","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'reference-request', 'totient-function', 'open-problem']"
3733282,Compute $\pi_2(S^2 \vee S^2)$,"As far as I know, there are two ways to calculate higher homotopy groups. One way is if we have a fibration then we get a long exact sequence in homotopy. The other is if we know a space is $(n-1)$ -connected, then by Hurewicz Theorem, $\pi_n \cong H_n$ . I know $H_2(S^2 \vee S^2)=\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ and $\pi_1(S^2 \vee S^2)$ is trivial as the pushout of $\pi_1(S^2) \leftarrow \pi_1(\ast) \rightarrow \pi_1(S^2)$ (using van Kampen's Theorem). Is it true that a wedge of $n$ -spheres is $(n-1)$ -connected? If so, why? If this is the case, Hurewicz applies. Also, is there any fibration involving $S^2 \vee  S^2$ ? I thought about the Hopf fibration $S^1 \rightarrow S^3 \rightarrow S^2$ , but intuitively I doubt that this produces another fibration $S^1 \vee S^1 \rightarrow S^3 \vee S^3 \rightarrow S^2 \vee S^2$ .

3733291,"If $X$ and $Y$ are two ordered sets, how many orderings of $X \times Y$ exist that preserve the orderings of $X$ and $Y$?","Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two totally ordered sets with $|X| = n_X$ and $|Y|=n_Y$ . We'll say an ordering ( $\preceq$ ) of $X \times Y$ preserves the orderings of $X$ and $Y$ if for any elements $x_1,\,x_2 \in X$ and $y_1,\,y_2 \in Y$ , we have $$x_1 \leq x_2 \implies (x_1, y_1) \preceq (x_2, y_1)$$ and similarly $$y_1 \leq y_2 \implies (x_1, y_1) \preceq (x_1, y_2)$$ How many orderings existing with this property? This order preservation property naturally induces a partial ordering on $X \times Y$ and the number of linear extensions of a poset is a $\sharp P$ -complete problem but given the natural structure of this order preservation, I'm hoping there may be a close-form solution or a polynomial-time algorithm that answers the question.","['order-theory', 'combinatorics']"
3733292,My solution to this UW Madison qualifying exam problem,"Can someone please check my solution to this qualifying exam problem? Thanks!! For each of the following, either construct a holomorphic function $f$ in the unit disk $D=\{z\in\mathbb{C}|\,|z|<1\}$ with the stated properties, or show that no such function exists. 1.For each sequence $(a_n)\subset D$ such that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|a_n|=1$ , it follows that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}|f(a_n)|+\infty$ . $|f'(0)|=2$ , $|f(z)|\leq 1$ for all $z$ such that $|z|=\frac{1}{2}$ , and $\Big|f\Big(\frac{3}{4}\Big)\Big|=\frac{5}{3}.$ 3. $|f(z)|\leq 1$ for all $z\in D$ , $f\Big(1-\frac{1}{n^2}\Big)=0$ for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ , and $f$ is not identically zero. My solution: 1.If such $f$ exists, first we claim the set of zeros of $D$ is finite. For otherwise, let $(z_n)$ be an infinite sequence consisting of distinct zeros of $f$ in $D$ such that $(z_n)$ converges to $z\in\mathbb{C}$ . If $z\in D$ , then $f(z)=0$ , which shows that $f$ is identically zero. If $z\notin D$ , then $|z_n|\rightarrow 1$ but $f(z_n)\rightarrow 0$ . Therefore, the set of zeros of $f$ is finite. Let $\xi_1,...,\xi_n$ be the zeros of $f$ repeated according to multiplicities, let $$g=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\xi_n-z}{1-\overline{\xi_n}z},$$ then $\frac{g}{f}$ is nonzero and holomorphic on $D$ and $\Big(\frac{g}{f}\Big)(a_n)\rightarrow 0$ if $(a_n)\subset D$ is a sequence such that $|a_n|\rightarrow 1$ . Let $h:\overline{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be defined by $$h(z)=\frac{g}{f}(z)$$ if $|z|<1$ and $$h(z)=0$$ if $|z|=1$ , then $h$ is holomorphic on $D$ and continuous on $\overline{D}$ . However $h=0$ on $\partial D$ , so $h=0$ on $\overline{D}$ by the maximum modulus principle. Contradiction! 2.If such $f$ exists, define $g:D(0,2)\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ by $g(z)=f\Big(\frac{z}{2}\Big)$ , then $|g'(0)|=1$ , $|g(z)|\leq 1$ for all $z$ such that $|z|=1$ and $\Big|g\Big(\frac{3}{2}\Big)\Big|=\frac{5}{3}$ . Cauchy integral formula says $$|g'(0)|=\bigg|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D(0,1)}\frac{g(z)}{z}\,dz\bigg|,$$ which implies that $|g(z)|=1$ if $|z|=1$ . Furthermore, same as before, $g$ only has finitely many zeros in $D(0,1)$ . Let $(z_1,...,z_n)$ be the zeros of $g$ in $D(0,1)$ , repeated according to multiplicities. Let $$h=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{z_i-z}{1-\overline{z_i}z},$$ if $n>0$ , and $h=1$ if $n=0$ ; then $\Big|\frac{g}{h}(z)\Big|=1$ and $\Big|\frac{h}{g}(z)\Big|=1$ if $|z|=1$ . Apply the maximum modulus principle to $\frac{f}{g}$ and $\frac{g}{h}$ , we see that there exists a $c\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|c|=1$ , and $g=ch$ . This shows that $n>0$ . Since $g$ has an analytic continuation to $D(0,2)$ , we have $|z_j|\leq\frac{1}{2}$ for each $j$ . Furthermore, we can compute that $$1=|g'(0)|=\bigg|\sum_{j=1}^n (1-|z_j|^2)z_1...z_{j-1}z_{j+1}...z_n \bigg|\leq n \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}.$$ However, the equality cannot be reached if $n>1$ , so $n=1$ . This shows that $1=1-|z_1|^2$ , hence $z_1=0$ . Therefore $g=cz$ for some constant $c\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|c|=1$ . Therefore, it is impossible that $\Big|f\Big(\frac{3}{4}\Big)\Big|=\frac{5}{3}.$ 3.Let $$f(z)=\prod_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\bigg(1-\frac{1}{n^2}\bigg)-z}{1-\bigg(1-\frac{1}{n^2}\bigg)z}.$$ Since $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}<\infty$ , the Blaschke product converges.",['complex-analysis']

3733392,"Prove that every collection of partitions $T$, there exists $\inf{T}$ and $\sup{T}$","I am self-studying Hrbacek and Jech's Introduction to Set Theory (3rd edition), and I want to know if the following solution to problem 5.10 (c) is correct. Unfortunately the book contains no answers and the only solution manual for the book I found thought it was too trivial to include its solution. For problem 5.10 (d) I would like some sort of clue, since the hint given in the book is, I think, a typo. Let $A$ be a non empty set and $\operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ be the set of all partitions of $A$ . Define a relation $\preceq$ in $\operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ by: $S_1 \preceq S_2$ if and only if for every $C \in S_1$ there is $D \in S_2$ such that $C \subseteq D$ . Take $T \subseteq \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ . Prove $\inf{T}$ exists. The idea is to find the greatest partition $S$ of $A$ such that, $S \preceq Q,$ for every $Q \in T$ . Since $A \neq \emptyset$ , take $x \in A$ and consider the set $P_x = \{ z \in A: \forall Q \in T, \exists E \in Q, (x,z \in E) \}$ . Define $S = \{P_x: x \in A \}$ . I want to prove $S = \inf T$ . First we show $S$ is indeed a partition of $A$ : $S$ contains non empty sets: This is easy, since for any $x \in A$ , $x \in P_x$ (Remember, for every $Q \in T, A = \bigcup Q$ ). $S$ is a collection of disjoint sets: Take $P_x, P_y \in S$ and $z \in P_x \cap Py$ . Then for every $Q \in T$ , there is some $E \in Q$ and some $F \in Q$ such that $x,z \in E$ and $y, z \in F$ . Since $E$ and $F$ belong to the partition $Q$ and $z \in E \cap F$ , we must have $E = F$ . This implies $P_x = P_y.$ $A = \bigcup S$ : $x \in A \Longleftrightarrow$ for every $Q \in T, x \in \bigcup Q \Longleftrightarrow$ for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $x \in Q \Longleftrightarrow x \in P_x,$ for $x \in A$ $\Longleftrightarrow x \in \bigcup S$ . So $S \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ , as desired. We now proceed to prove $S$ is indeed the infimum of $T$ : $S$ is a lower bound of $T$ : We want to show that $S \preceq R$ , for every $R \in T$ . So let $R$ be any partition in $T$ . If $P_x \in S,$ for $x \in A$ , let $F$ be the set in $R$ that contains $x$ (there is one and only one such set); we show $P_x \subseteq F$ . If $z \in P_x$ , then for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $x,z \in E$ . In particular, for partition $R$ we have $x,z \in F$ . Then $P_x \subseteq F$ and we conclude $S \preceq R$ , as wanted. $S = \inf{T}$ : Let $S_0 \in \operatorname{Pt}{A}$ such that $S_0 \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . We prove $S_0 \preceq S$ , so let us take $F \in S_0$ and $x \in F$ (the set $F$ is not empty). Then, for every $Q \in T$ there is some $E \in Q$ such that $F \subseteq E$ ; so every element in $F$ (in particular $x$ ) is contained in all those sets $E$ , hence $F \subseteq P_x$ , with $P_x \in S$ . We conclude $S_0 \preceq S$ . We conclude $\inf{T} = S$ . Prove $\sup{T}$ exists. For this the book suggests forming $T_0 = \{ R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}: \forall Q \in T, Q \preceq R \}$ , and then showing $\sup{T_0} = \inf{T}$ ; however I think this is a typo, and the authors meant $\sup{T} = \inf{T_0}$ . For this part, actually, I am a bit lost. I tried writing the definitions, but couldn't even show $\inf{T}$ is an upper bound for $T$ . In problem 5.10 (c) I would like any feedback, especially from the very last part ( $S = \inf{T}$ ), as it feels a bit sketchy for me. Thank you for the help. Update: Thank you for the answer. I will fill in the details in your argument, if only for the sake of future reference: Prove $\inf{T}$ exists.
Let us start by recalling that there is an asossiated equivalence relation $\sim_Q$ in $A$ for every $Q \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ : $x \sim_Q y \Longleftrightarrow$ there is some $C \in Q$ such that $x, y \in C$ . Let $Q, R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ . Then, $Q \preceq R \Longleftrightarrow \sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ : First the ( $\Longrightarrow$ ) direction: Assume $Q \preceq R$ . If $x \sim_Q y$ , then there is some $C \in Q$ such that $x,y \in C.$ But this implies the existence of some $D \in R$ such that $C \subseteq D$ (definition of $\preceq$ ). Hence $x, y$ both belong to some set in $R$ (namely $D$ ), so $x \sim_R y$ . We concluce $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ . Now the ( $\Longleftarrow$ ) direction: Assume $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ . If $C \in Q$ , then $C \neq \emptyset$ , so we take some $x \in C$ . The relation $\sim_Q$ is reflexive so $x \sim_Q x$ , which implies $x \sim_R x$ . This is, $x$ belongs to some $D \in R$ . Notice this set $D$ is unique, for if $y \in C$ and $x \neq y$ , then $x \sim_Q y$ ; this again implies $x \sim_R y$ , which means $x$ and $y$ belong to the same set in $R$ . But $R$ is a partition, so $x$ can belong to only one set in this partition, the set $D$ . Thus, $C \subseteq D$ and $Q \preceq R$ . Now we define $\sim = \bigcap \{\sim_Q: Q \in T\}$ , which is an equivalence relation in $A$ (we leave this easy verification for the reader). This relation induces a partition of $A$ , $A/\sim = \{[x]_\sim: x \in A\}$ , which will be denoted by $S$ for simpliticy. We show $\inf{T} = S$ : $S$ is a lower bound of $T$ : We know $\sim \subseteq \sim_Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Then, $S \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . $\inf{T} = S$ : Let $S_0 \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}$ be such that $S_0 \preceq Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Then $\sim_{S_0} \subseteq \sim_Q$ , for every $Q \in T$ . Hence, $\sim_{S_0} \subseteq \sim$ , which implies $S_0 \preceq S$ as desired. We conclude $\inf{T} = S$ . Prove $\sup{T}$ exists. Let $T_0 = \{ R \in \operatorname{Pt}{(A)}: \forall Q \in T, Q \preceq R \}$ . By the previous exercise, $\inf{T_0} = F$ exists and its induced equivalence relation is: $\sim_F = \bigcap\{\sim_R: R \in T_0\}$ . We show $\sup{T} = F$ . $F$ is an uper bound of $T$ : Take $Q \in T$ . Then we have $Q \preceq R$ , for every $R \in T_0$ , which implies $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_R$ , for every $R \in T_0$ . Hence $\sim_Q \subseteq \sim_F$ , and thus $Q \preceq F$ . So $F$ is an upper bound of $T$ . $\sup{T} = F$ : The partition $\inf{T_0} = F$ is an upper bound for $T$ , but $T_0$ is the set of upper bounds for $T$ and, then, it is the least upper bound for $T$ . We conclude $\sup{T} = F$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification', 'set-partition', 'problem-solving']"
3733394,In how many ways can you bet thirteen different football matches to get exactly 12 right,"In how many ways can you bet thirteen different football matches to get exactly 12 wins? My attempt First I notice that there is only $1$ way to bet $13$ different matches to get $13$ wins. Second, I notice that ther are $3^{13}$ ways to bet $13$ different football matches. Now, I refrase the question: In how many ways can you bet thirteen different football matches to get exactly $1$ loss? This gives $$\binom{13}{1}\cdot2^{1} = \frac{13!}{1! (12)!}\cdot2=13\cdot2=26.$$ Now, assume you want to know in how many ways you can bet thirteen different football matches to get exactly $2$ losses? Well that would give $$\binom{13}{2}\cdot2^{2} = \frac{13!}{2! (11)!}\cdot4=78\cdot4=312.$$ So, the general formula is $\binom{n}{r}\cdot2^{r} = \frac{n!}{r! (n-r)!}\cdot2^{r}.$ On the other hand, with $13$ matches to be bet on and exactly $1$ to be a loss, I could argue that the loosing match could be chosen in $13$ different ways, and that each match only have $2$ possible choices, as $$13\cdot2=26.$$ This result corresponds well to the answer above. With the same argument, with $13$ matches to be bet on and exactly $2$ to be a losses I could argue that the first loosing match could be chosen in $13$ different ways, and the second loosing match in $12$ different ways, and that each match only have $2$ possible choices, as $$13\cdot12\cdot2=312.$$ Even this result correspond to the answer above. But, when repeating the calculation for the choice of $3$ lost games (corresponding to $10$ wins), the magic disappears: $$\binom{13}{3}\cdot2^{3} = \frac{13!}{3! (10)!}\cdot8=286\cdot8=2288\ne13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot2=3432.$$ Where do I go wrong?","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I am interested in the rate of growth of $f(n)$ as $n \to \infty$ . In other words, is there a way to quantify how fast $f(n)$ approaches its limit as a function of $n$ and some “property” of $X$ ? A few observations: Upper bound: By Cauchy-Schwarz we have that $f(n) \le 1$ . Exact limit: It can be shown that $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty} f(n)=1$ . So, we are trying to refine this limit. Trivial example: If $X$ is supported on $\{0,B\}$ , then $f(n)= 1$ for all $n \ge 1$ . Connection to Strong Cauchy-Schwarz: Essentially, this is a question about the sharper versions of Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Therefore, using the expression for the correction term in Cauchy-Schwartz we have $$
f(n)=1-\frac{1}{2} E \left[ \left| \frac{X^\frac{n-1}{2}}{ \sqrt{E[X^{n-1}]}}  -\frac{X^\frac{n+1}{2}}{ \sqrt{E[X^{n+1}]}}\right|^2 \right].

3733486,"If R is a ring, and A has all the sets in R and it's complements, is A an algebra? (Halmos Measure Theory question)","The question I have is related to problem 4.5 in chapter 1 of Halmos' text . Some definitions related to the question are the following. If $X$ is a set then a ring $\textbf{R}$ is a non-empty class of subsets such that if $E,F\in \textbf{R}$ then $E\cup F, E-F\in \textbf{R}$ , where $E-F=E\cap F^c$ . Similarly, an algebra is a non-empty class of sets such that if $E,F\in \textbf{R}$ then $E\cup F\in \textbf{R}$ and $E\in\textbf{R}$ then $E^c\in\textbf{R}$ . The problem in the text is as follows. If $\textbf{R}$ is a ring, and $A=\{E\subseteq X|E\in \textbf{R}$ or $E^c\in\textbf{R}\}$ , then show that $A$ is an algebra. My trouble is in the following line of argument in showing so. If $E\in\textbf{R}$ and $F\in A$ is such that $F^c\in\textbf{R}$ , why does it imply that $E\cup F\in A$ ? I'm surely missing something. Here's what I've got till now. $E\cup F^c\in R\subseteq A\Rightarrow$ either $E\cup F^c\in R$ or $E^c \cap F\in R$ . In the case of the latter, $E\cup F=(E-F)\cup (F-E)\cup (E\cap F)\in R$ by definition, but I'm stuck with the former and have tried other arguments like showing that it's in the intersection of all algebras that contain the ring and $X$ , but can't wrap my head around why $E\cup F$ in this case must be in $A$ , and am starting to doubt whether $A$ would even be an algebra.

3733506,"If a function has a jacobian with linearly independent columns on a set B, is the following union equal to B?","Suppose we have a function $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ with the condition that the rows of the Jacobian matrix of $f$ are linearly independent on $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ .

3733558,Does Hilbert's theorem 90 hold for local rings?,"Let $R$ be a local ring (commutative with 1). Let $G$ be a finite subgroup of $\text{Aut}(R)$ preserving the maximal ideal. Then it seems to me that we also have: $$H^1(G,R^\times) = 0$$ Is this correct? (The classical Hilbert theorem 90 states this when $R$ is a field). Here's the argument: First, you need the Lemma: If $g_1,\ldots,g_n$ are distinct automorphisms of $R$ , then if for $c_i\in R$ , $\sum_{i=1}^n c_ig_i = 0$ (as a function $R\rightarrow R$ ), then each $c_i = 0$ . Indeed, one may assume that there is a minimal such relation, where $c_1g_1 + \cdots + c_rg_r = 0$ with $c_1,\ldots,c_r$ all nonzero. In this case we must have $r > 1$ since $c_1g_1 = 0$ means $c_1g_1(1) = c_1\cdot 1 = 0$ so $c_1 = 0$ . Now since $g_1\ne g_r$ , let $a\in R$ be such that $g_1(a)\ne g_r(a)$ . Let $x\in R$ be arbitrary. We have: $$\sum_{i=1}^r c_ig_i(ax) = \sum_{i=1}^r c_ig_i(a)g_i(x) = \sum_{i=1}^rc_ig_i(x) = 0$$ Multiplying the last sum by $g_r(a)$ and subtracting from the second sum, we get: $$\sum_{i=1}^rc_i(g_i(a)-g_r(a))g_i(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{r-1}c_i(g_i(a)-g_r(a))g_i(x) = 0$$ Since this holds for all $x\in R$ , this gives a shorter relation and by our choice of $a$ , the coefficients are not all zero, since $c_1(g_1(a) - g_r(a))\ne 0$ . To prove the theorem, we now proceed as usual: Let $\alpha : G\rightarrow R^\times$ be a 1-cocycle, so $\alpha$ satisfies $\alpha(gh) = \alpha(g)\cdot (g.\alpha(h))$ . In particular, we have $g.\alpha(h) = \alpha(g)^{-1}\alpha(gh)$ . Applying the above result to the residue field $R/\mathfrak{m}$ , the linear combination $$\sum_{g\in G}\alpha(g)\cdot g$$ is nonzero in the residue field. Thus, there exists a $\theta\in R$ such that $$\beta := \sum_{g\in G}\alpha(g)\cdot g(\theta) \in R^\times$$ Then, for each $h\in G$ , we have $$h(\beta) = h\left(\sum_{g\in G}\alpha(g)\cdot g(\theta)\right) = \sum_{g\in G}h(\alpha(g))\cdot (hg)(\theta) = \sum_{g\in G}(\alpha(h)^{-1}\alpha(hg))\cdot (hg)(\theta) = \alpha(h)^{-1}\sum_{g\in G}\alpha(hg)\cdot (hg)(\theta) = \alpha(h)^{-1}\beta$$ Thus, $\alpha(h) = \frac{\beta}{h(\beta)} = \frac{h(\beta^{-1})}{\beta^{-1}}$ , so $\alpha$ is a coboundary. Does this seem right? I just want to record this here since I find it strange that I've never seen this simple generalization, which doesn't require any real additional technology to state or prove.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

First, in many books, these is such a sentence: let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ , then a finite group $G$ acts on $X$ on the right is  equivalent to $G$ acts on $A$ on the left. I try to write this explicitly. $\Longrightarrow$ Suppose $G$ acts right on $X$ , then we have group homomorphism: $\phi: G^{op}\to \mathrm{Aut}(X)=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Spec}(A)), g\to \phi_{g} $ . $\phi_{g}$ induces a ring homomorphism $\hat{\phi}_{g}\in \mathrm{Aut}(A)$ . Then we could get a group homomorrphism $\psi: G\to \mathrm{Aut}(A)$ . Thus we have right action $G$ on $A$ . $\Longleftarrow:$ similarly.  Is this understanding right? Secondly, when we say a group acts on a scheme, do we mean left action or right action? I feel often we mean left action, that is a group homomorrphism $G\to \mathrm{Aut}(X)$ . Am I right? Thirdly, how should I understand Galois action on an affine variety? For example, let $G=Gal(\mathbb{Q(i)/\mathbb{Q}})=\{1, \sigma\}$ and $H=Gal(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ , $\tau$ is a non-trivial element of $H$ . $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Q}[x])$ . How to describe $\sigma,\tau$ acting on $X$ ? Suppose $\sigma,\tau$ corresponds $\phi_{\sigma},\phi_{\tau}\in \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Q}[x])$ , then what are $\phi_{\sigma},\phi_{\tau}$ ? It seems that rational points do not move, but some other points move. I do not know how to describe it. Fourth, how to understand Galois action on a non-affine variety? For example, using the same notion with the third, but let $X=\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{Q}}^{1}$ or $\mathrm{Proj}(\mathbb{Q}[x,y,z]/(y^2z-x^3-xz^2))$ , how to describe the action $\sigma,\tau$ on $X$ exactly? For general projective variety $X$ , should we first embed it to some projective space and them describe Galois action on it? Lastly, how to understand the Galois action on morphism of varieties? That is let $X$ and $Y$ be two varieties over $k$ , $\phi: X\to Y$ is a morphism between them. Let $G=Gal(\bar{k}/k)$ , $\sigma$ is an element of $G$ , then what is the action of $\sigma$ on $\phi$ , $\phi^{\sigma}$ ? Many books just write it and never explain it. For example ,let $X=Y=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Q}[x])$ and $\phi$ corresponds the ring map $x\to x^2$ , then what is $\phi^{\sigma}$ ? If $X=Y=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Q}(i)[x])$ , $\phi$ also corresponds $x\to x^{2}$ , , then what is $\phi^{\sigma}$ ? Thank you very much for reading these questions. Could you explain these to me?

So far I've gotten that if the result does not hold, we have $8 \le |S_i| \le 14$ for all $i,$ but I cannot rule out these cases. I also tried to draw segments within a $6 \times 21$ rectangle to find sets which violated the condition, and always failed by the time I got to the $5$ th row, so maybe the bound isn't even that sharp. The problem with the probabilistic method is that $p(k \in S_i \, \& \, k \in S_j) \ne p(k \in S_i)p(k \in S_j)$ since the events are not independent. If you use conditional probabilities to fix this, you end up getting $\mathbb{E}(|S_i \cup S_j|) = \dots = \mathbb{E}(|S_i \cup S_j|).$ This problem is outside the realm of horseshoe combinatorics, so such an equality is not helpful. The issue with the pigeonhole principle is that while it will give you interesting bounds on numbers within $\{1,2,\dots,21\}$ appearing in at least this or that amount of sets $S_i,$ it will not produce a set of numbers appearing in two sets simultaneously; you might be drawing different numbers over and over.

3733671,Is $S =\{ x \in T\}$ proper notation?,"I am a bit confused regarding the set-builder notation. If I'm correct, in general, a set is described by $S = \{ x \mid p(x) \}$ where p(x) is some conditional. That's what my professor's lecture notes, say at least. My professor's lecture notes define $\mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{p}{q} \mid p,q\in\mathbb{Z} \wedge q\neq0\}$ and define $\mathbb{N} = \{x\in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \geq 0\}$ . The way I understand the general notation, a set $S$ compromises all arbitrary objects $x$ that meet the conditional statement $p(x)$ . With this understanding, the given definition of $\mathbb{Q}$ makes sense to me: it is compromised of all objects $\frac{p}{q}$ meeting some criteria. The given definition of $\mathbb{N}$ , however, seems to say it is comprised of a conditional statement, $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ , rather than some arbitrary object. At least, it seems to be a conditional to me based on its usage elsewhere. Basically, is notating a set $S = \{x\in T\}$ proper? If so, why is this the case—given the qualms I have listed above? It makes much more sense to me that $S = \{x \mid x\in T\}$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'notation']"

3733889,Kind of a proof for the circumference of a circle?,"Hello fellow StackExchange members! Some time ago, I was thinking about the proofs concerning the circumference of a circle and had the following idea. Having insufficient knowledge in trigonometry and calculus at that time, I couldn't get myself to ""do the math"". But after taking classes, I now have the ability (and time due to quarantine!) to share my proof with you. I do not know if this counts as a proof since we have a predefined definition of $π$ , but here is my way of thinking: In a regular polygon of $n$ sides and with a distance $r$ between its vertices and its center, we can use trigonometry to find the length of one side. ( $n∈\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $r∈\mathbb{R}^+$ ) First of all, we have to find the central angle $α$ between any two neighboring ""radii"" forming an isosceles triangle when looked at with the side connecting the two vertices. To find this, we can divide the central angle of $2π$ to the number of sides: $α=\frac{2π}{n}$ Next, we can use the law of cosines to calculate the length of the third side of the isosceles triangle, which also happens to be the side length of the regular polygon. Let's call the side length $s$ . $s=\sqrt{r^2+r^2-2⋅r⋅r⋅\cos(α)}=\sqrt{2r^2-2⋅r^2⋅\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}\\=r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}$ To find the total perimeter ( $P$ ) of the regular polygon, we have to multiply the number of sides by the side lenght: $P=n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}$ Now, when $n$ approaches infinity, our polygon should approach to being a circle; so if we take the limit  of this expression with $n$ approaching infinity, we should be able to approximate the circumference of the circle with a radius of $r$ . (I urge you to plot this function into a graphic calculator with $x$ instead of $n$ as a variable. As $x$ fets larger, the function approaches the value of $2πr$ . I was really happy to see this for the first time.) Before the limit, let's simplify our expression. I was careful with the domains and ranges of the trigonometric functions and rewriting the expression in the following way should not cause any problems while taking the limit at infinity. $n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}=n⋅r\sqrt{2(1-\cos(2⋅\frac{π}{n}))}\\=n⋅r\sqrt{2[1-(1-2\sin^2(\frac{π}{n}))]}=n⋅r\sqrt{4\sin^2(\frac{π}{n})}=2⋅n⋅r⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})$ (That simplification was quite magical for my simple mind!) Let's now take the limit: $\lim_{n \to \infty} n⋅r\sqrt{2-2\cos(\frac{2π}{n})}=\lim_{n \to \infty}2⋅n⋅r⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}n⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})$ Now this was where I got stumped for a while; until I learned L'Hospital's Rule of course! We can rewrite the expression as follows: $2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}n⋅\sin(\frac{π}{n})=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{π}{n})}{\frac{1}{n}}$ We now see that the limit gives us $\frac{0}{0}$ as $n$ approaches infinity so let's use L'Hospital's Rule: $2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\sin(\frac{π}{n})}{\frac{1}{n}}=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\frac{d}{dn}(\sin(\frac{π}{n}))}{\frac{d}{dn}(\frac{1}{n})}\\=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{\cos(\frac{π}{n})⋅(-\frac{π}{n^2})}{-\frac{1}{n^2}}=2r⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}π⋅\cos(\frac{π}{n})\\=2πr⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\cos(\frac{π}{n})$ Since the limit of the fraction $\frac{π}{n}$ approaches $0$ , the value of $\cos(\frac{π}{n})$ approaches $1$ : $2πr⋅\lim_{n \to \infty}\cos(\frac{π}{n})=2πr⋅1=2πr$ And this is how I ended up with the circumference of a circle. Thank you very much for sticking around until the end! Is this a mathematically correct way of proving the circumference of a circle?","['trigonometry', 'solution-verification', 'circles']"

Consider a nonempty set $W$ . Let $F$ be the set of all nonempty finite subsets of W. Find $\bigcup_{A \in F}A$ and $\bigcap_{A \in F}A$ . So what i have done: knowing that $(\forall x)(x \in W \Leftrightarrow \{x\} \subseteq W)$ , we have that for any $x$ in $W$ the singleton set $\{x\}$ is also in $F$ , thus the union of all these singleton sets is all the elements of $W$ , then $\bigcup_{A \in F}A = W$ . For the intersection part i think its possible to have two different results, if we consider $W$ as a singleton like $W=\{a\}$ , then $F=\{\{a\}\}$ and in this case $\bigcap_{A \in F}A = \{a\} = W$ .
But if we consider $W$ having two or more elements we will have an obvious intersection with disjoint sets and therefore $\bigcap_{A \in F}A = \emptyset$ . My results are correct? and should i did this with less words?","['elementary-set-theory', 'solution-verification']"

If ${A}$ is large enough, an application of the Chernoff bound (11) (or more precisely, the refinement in Exercise 3) then gives (after some computation) $$\displaystyle {\bf P}( |S_{n,m}| \geq 2^{-m-1} A n ) \leq C' 2^{-m} \exp( - c' A n )$$ (say) for some ${C', c' > 0}$ , and the claim follows.

 {\bf P}( |S_{n,m}| \geq 2^{-m-1} A n ) &=  {\bf P}( |S_{n,m}| \geq \lambda\sigma)\\

So I don't understand why $L(f,P'')-L(f,P)\le2M(\text{mesh} P)(\text{width}Q)^{n-1}$ Let be $P:=(P_1,...,P_n)$ and we create a refinement $P''$ of $P$ by adding a point $q$ at the $i$ -th partition $P_i$ which is part of $P$ so that $P$ and $P''$ differ only for the subrectangles whose sides contain the newly added point, that is for the subrectangles of the form $R_S:=S\times[a_i,q]\times T$ , $R_T:=S\times[q,b_i]\times T$ of $P''$ and $R':=S\times[a_i,b_i]\times T$ of $P$ , where $S$ is a rectangle of $\Bbb{R}^i$ and $T$ is a rectangle of $\Bbb{R}^{n-i}$ .

Now for convenience we define $$\lambda:=\text{width} Q$$ and we observe that if $R=[\alpha_1,\beta_1]\times...\times[\alpha_n,\beta_n]$ is a subrectangle of $P$ then $R\subseteq Q$ and so if $Q=[a_1,b_1]\times...\times[a_n,b_n]$ then $[\alpha_j,\beta_j]\subseteq[a_j,b_j]$ for any $j=1,...,n$ so that $\beta_j-\alpha_j\le\lambda$ ; analogously we define $$\delta:=\text{mesh} P$$ so that clearly $\beta_j-\alpha_j\le\delta$ for any $j=1,..,n$ . So is not difficult to see that $$v(R)\le\delta\lambda^{n-1}$$ for any subrectangle $R$ of $P$ . Now if $|f(x)|\le M$ for any $x\in Q$ then $-M\le m_{R_S},m_{R_T},m_{R'}\le M$ so that $-m_{R'}(f)\cdot v(R')\le M\cdot v(R')$ and $m_{R_S}(f)\cdot v(R_S)\le M\cdot v(R_S)$ and $m_{R_T}(f)\cdot v(R_T)\le M\cdot v(R_T)$ .

3734250,Are normal subgroups of finite index in an absolute Galois groups open?,"Let $G$ be a profinite group. It is known that open normal subgroups of $G$ have finite index, but in general not every normal subgroup of finite index is open (see https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/profinite+group#examples for a counterexample). This last fact is true if the profinite group is (topologically) finitely generated (this is a theorem of Nikolov–Segal). Let now $K$ be a field. A theorem about the ""inverse Galois problem"" states that for every profinite group $G$ there are fields $K\subseteq L\subseteq F$ such that $Gal(F/L)\cong G$ . This means that also for general Galois groups, it is not true that every normal subgroup of finite index is open. My question is: could this be always true for absolute Galois groups, i.e. for Galois groups of extensions $\bar{K}/K$ with $K$ field and $\bar{K}$ the separable closure of $K$ ? My question is justified by a sentence I found in Silverman's book ""The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves"" where, at the beginning of the appendix B.2, it is written ""Let $G_{\bar{K}/K}$ be the Galois group of $\bar{K}/K$ . (...) Thus $G_{\bar{K}/K}$ is a profinite group, i.e. an inverse limit of finite groups.

By using the substitution $u = 1+bx$ , I obtained $$\left(1 + \frac ab (u-1) \right)^{1/a} = u^{1/b},$$ which led me to the nicer looking equation $$u^{a/b} - \frac abu + \frac ab -1 = 0.$$ I also noticed that using the substitution $v = u^{1/b}$ led me to $$v^a - \frac ab v^b + \frac ab -1 = 0,$$ which also yielded $$\sum_{r=0}^{a-1} v^r - \frac ab\sum_{r=0}^{b-1} v^r = 0,$$ which is an $a-1$ degree polynomial in $v$ . Interestingly, the first $b-1$ terms of this polynomial have the same coefficient equal to $1 - a/b$ and the rest have a coefficient equal to $1$ . But, through either of these approaches, I still get stuck. Any help would be much appreciated! Sorry for the late response! There were some mistakes on my part, and I hope to correct them here in this edit. Proof of unique solution $x < -2/b$ . Begin by raising $a$ on both sides to obtain $$1 + ax = (1 + bx)^{a/b} \implies 0 = (1 + bx)^{a/b} - ax - 1.$$ Define $f(x) = (1 + bx)^{a/b} - ax - 1$ . Its derivative is given by $$f'(x) = a(1 + bx)^{\frac ab - 1} - a = a((1+bx)^{\frac {a-b}b} - 1).$$ Now, since $a,b$ are both positive odd integers with $a  >b$ , we have that $a-b$ is a positive even integer, and thus, $$(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \geq 0$$ holds over all real $x$ . The quantity $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \leq 1$ only when $|1 + bx| \leq 1$ , or when $-2/b \leq x \leq 0$ , and similarly $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} \geq 1$ only when $|1 + bx| \geq 1$ , or when either $x \geq 0$ or $x \leq -2/b$ . Finally, note that $(1 + bx)^{\frac{a-b}b} = 1$ when $|1 + bx| = 1$ , or when $x = 0$ or $x = -2/b$ . From here, since $a > 0$ , we have that $$f'(x) > 0 \quad \text{when } x \in (-\infty, -2/b) \cup (0, \infty),$$ and $$f'(x) < 0 \quad \text{when } x \in (-2/b, 0),$$ and $$f'(x) = 0 \quad \text{when } x = 0, -2/b.$$ Here I've used interval notation to denote the possible values of $x$ . Notice $f(0) = 0$ . Since $f$ strictly increases for $x > 0$ , we have that $f(x) > f(0) = 0$ for all $x > 0$ . Now, $f$ strictly decreases for $-2/b < x < 0$ , so $f(x) > f(0) = 0$ , for $-2/b < x < 0$ , which implies that there are no roots in the interval $(-2/b, 0)$ . Finally, we note the value $f(-2/b) = 2a/b - 2$ , for which, since $a/b > 1$ , we have $2a/b - 2 > 0$ . The function $f$ strictly increases for $x < -2/b$ , so $f(x) < f(-2/b)$ , and in particular, $f$ is injective on this interval. That is, on this interval, $$f(s) = f(t) \implies s = t, \quad \text{for } s,t < -2/b.$$ Since $f(-2/b) > 0$ , there is exactly one $x$ with $x < -2/b$ such that $f(x) = 0$ , signaling the end of the proof. For a more visual representation of this proof, see this Desmos graph. I should also mention some background on how I stumbled across this problem. I was investigating a generalization of Bernoulli's inequality, for which the classic version states that $$(1 + x)^n \geq 1 + nx$$ for $n = 1,2,\dots$ and $x \geq -1$ . In particular, I was investigating the inequality $$\left(1 + x\right)^{\frac ab} \geq 1 + \frac ab x$$ over real $x$ and positive integers $a,b$ and determining when the above holds. It is known that the above holds for $x \geq -1$ , which can be shown with calculus over real $a/b$ . ( Here's the Wikipedia page if you're interested. ) However, I was more interested with the case in which $x < -1$ . There must be additional restrictions, however, in particular $b$ must be odd, or $(1 + x)^{a/b}$ will not be a real number. I was able to show that the inequality held for all real $x$ when $a$ was even, however, for odd $a$ , I had determined that there was a negative nonzero solution to the equation $$(1 + x)^{a/b} = 1 + \frac ab x.$$ At this solution, say $x_0$ , I had that the inequality did not hold for $x < x_0$ . To obtain the original inequality I posted here, you raise both sides by $1/a$ and take the transformation $x \mapsto bx$ , which gave the much more aesthetically pleasing equation $$(1 + ax)^{1/a} = (1 + bx)^{1/b}.$$ From here, I think it would be appropriate to ask a few other questions other than ""what's the solution?"". In particular, for positive integers $n,m$ , if $R(n,m)$ is the solution to the equation, $$(1 + (2n-1)x)^{2n-1} = (1 + (2m-1)x)^{2m-1},$$ then... Can we approximate $R(n,m)$ to a precise degree? (This one is mostly solved by Newton's method which was mentioned by someone who for some reason I can't find now.) Can we create any identities involving $R(a,b)$ ? I am particularly interested with question 2. If I find anything, I'll be sure to add it in another edit to this post. Thanks guys!","['algebra-precalculus', 'inequality']"

3734540,Proof verification: Pringsheim interpolation formula,"This is an exercise in Complex Analysis by Stein, Exercise 5.17. Let $\{a_n\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of distinct complex numbers such that $a_0 =0$ and $\lim_{k \to \infty} |a_k| = \infty$ , and let \begin{align*}
E(z)=z\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}{E_n (\frac{z}{a_n})}
\end{align*} , where $E_k$ is Weierstrass canonical factors defined by \begin{align*}
E_k (z) = (1-z) e^{z+ \frac{z^2}{2} + \cdots + \frac{z^k}{k}}
\end{align*} Given complex numbers $\{b_k\}_{k=0}^{\infty}$ , show that there exist integers $m_k \ge 1$ such that the series \begin{align*}
F(z) = \frac{b_0}{E'(a_0 )}\frac{E(z)}{z} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_k}{E'(a_k)}\frac{E(z)}{z-a_k} \Big ( \frac{z}{a_k} \Big ) ^{m_k} 
\end{align*} defines an entire function that satisfies $F(a_k )=b_k $ for all $k \ge 0$ . Here is my proof, which I want to get verified. I assumed that I already know that $E(z)$ is entire, and has simple zeros only at $\{a_k\}$ s. First, let's prove that $E'(a_k) \neq 0$ , so that fractions are well-defined. Since $E$ has simple zero at $a_k$ , there exists entire function $F_k$ where $E(z)=(z-a_k)F_k (z)$ and $F_k (a_k) \neq 0$ . Then, \begin{align*}
E'(z)=F_k (z) + (z- a_k ) {F_k}'(z)
\end{align*} , thus we have $E'(a_k) \neq 0$ , as desired. Now let $m_k$ be an integer that satisfies \begin{align*}
\frac{|b_k|}{|E'(a_k)|} \frac{1}{3} 4^{1-m_k} < 2^{-k}
\end{align*} To prove that $F$ is entire, we only need to prove that the infinite sum converges uniformly in the closed disc $|z| \le R$ . Let $M_R$ be the supremum of $E(z)$ in $|z| \le R$ . Let $N$ be a integer such that $n \ge N$ yields $|a_n| \ge \max\{RM_R , 4R\}$ . Then for $N' \ge N$ , we have \begin{align*}
\Big | \sum_{k=N'}^{\infty} \frac{b_k}{E'(a_k)} \frac{E(z)}{z-a_k} \Big ( \frac{z}{a_k} \Big )^{m_k} \Big | &\le \sum_{k=N'}^{\infty} \frac{|b_k|}{|E'(a_k)|} \frac{|E(z)|}{|z-a_k|} \Big | \frac{z}{a_k} \Big |^{m_k} \\
&\le \sum_{k=N'}^{\infty} \frac{|b_k|}{|E'(a_k)|} \frac{M_R}{4R-R} \frac{R}{RM_R} \Big ( \frac{R}{4R} \Big ) ^{m_k -1} \\
&= \sum_{k=N'}^{\infty} \frac{|b_k|}{|E'(a_k)|} \frac{1}{3R} \Big ( \frac{1}{4} \Big ) ^{m_k -1} \\
&\le \sum_{k=N'}^{\infty} \frac{2^{-k}}{R} = \frac{2^{1-N'}}{R}
\end{align*} Since right side of the inequality converges to $0$ as $N' \to \infty$ , our infinite sum converges uniformly. Thus, $F$ is entire. Now we only need to prove that $F(a_n) = b_n$ . Using that $E(a_n)=0$ and $\lim\limits_{z \to a_n} \frac{E(z)}{z-a_n} = E'(a_n)$ , \begin{align*}
F(a_n) = \frac{b_n}{E'(a_n)} \frac{E(z)}{z-a_n} \Big | _ {z=a_n} = b_n

3734561,Basis of $L(4p_0)$ for a torus and induced embedding into $\mathbb{P}^3$,"I am trying to solve the following exercise; in more general situations also I do not know how to address the problem of finding the equations for the image of a Riemann surface under the embedding induced by a very ample divisor. We consider a complex torus $E=\mathbb{C}/L$ and we denote $p_0=[0] \in E$ . I have to describe a basis of $L(4p_0)$ and find equations for the image of $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ under the embedding induced by the divisor $4p_0$ . I have more or less no idea where to start. We have done something similar in class in the case of $3p_0$ : we have observed that there must be some non constant function in $L(2p_0)$ and that this function, say $f$ must have a pole of order $2$ at $p_0$ and no other poles and must be even; up to rescaling and subtracting a constant we can WLOG suppose that a local representative of $f$ is given by $f(z)=1/z^2+\alpha z^2+\mathrm{h.o.t.}$ for some $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ , hence a basis for $L(2p_0)$ is given by $\{1, f\}$ . Taking (a multiple of) the derivative of $f$ we get a meromorphic function $g=-\frac{1}{2}f'$ which is odd and has a pole of order $3$ at $p_0$ ; $\{1, f, g\}$ is a basis of $L(3p_0)$ and using Laurent expansion we get that $g^2-f^3\in L(2p_0)$ , hence $g^2-f^3=af+b$ for some constants. So the image of the embedding $\phi(z)=[1:f(z):g(z)]$ is in the zero locus of the homogenized polynomial $h(x_1, x_2, x_3)=x_1x_3^2-x_2^3+ax_1^2x_2+bx_1^3$ and we can actually prove that $\phi(X)=Z(h)$ . Now in the case of the exercise the most natural thing seemed considering the function $h= -\frac{1}{3} g'$ and form a basis of $L(4p_0)$ as $\{1, f, g, h\}$ , but as for the equations for $\phi(X)$ I have no ideas.","['riemann-surfaces', 'complex-geometry', 'divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'meromorphic-functions']"

(a) Show that $\pm 1$ are the only eigenvalues of $T$ . (b) Describe the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue of $T$ . (c) Find an ordered basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $M_{2\times 2}(\textbf{R})$ such that $[T]_{\mathcal{B}}$ is a diagonal matrix. (d) Find an ordered basis $\mathcal{B}$ for $M_{n\times n}(\textbf{R})$ such that $[T]_{\mathcal{B}}$ is a diagonal matrix for $n > 2$ . MY (NEW) ATTEMPT (a) Let $A\in M_{n\times n}(\textbf{R})$ s.t. $A
\neq 0$ . Then $A$ is an eigenvector of $T$ iff $T(A) = \lambda A$ , that is to say, $A^{t} = \lambda A$ . Based on it, we conclude that $A = \lambda A^{t}$ . Finally, one has that \begin{align*}
A^{t} = \lambda(\lambda A^{t}) \Rightarrow A^{t} = \lambda^{2}A^{t} \Rightarrow \det(A^{t}) = \lambda^{2n}\det(A^{t}) \Rightarrow \lambda^{2n} = 1 \Rightarrow \lambda = \pm 1
\end{align*} But I still do not know how to justify the implication where we consider $\det(A^{t}) \neq 0$ Any help in this sense is appreciated. (b) For $\lambda = 1$ , we have that $T(A) = A^{t} = A$ . Thus the eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda = 1$ belongs to the subspace of symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. For $\lambda = -1$ , we have that $T(A) = A^{t} = -A$ . Thus the eigenvectors corresponding to $\lambda = -1$ belongs to the subspace of skew-symmetric $n\times n$ matrices. (c) Let us determine the eigenspace associated to each eigenvalue. We shall start with $\lambda =1$ : \begin{align*}
T(A) = 1\cdot A \Rightarrow A^{t} = A \Rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
a & c\\
b & d
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b\\
c & d
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow b = c
\end{align*} Thus the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue $\lambda = 1$ is spanned by \begin{align*}
E_{1} = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0\\
0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\right\}
\end{align*} We may now proceed and determine the eigenspace associated to $\lambda = -1$ : \begin{align*}
T(A) = -1\cdot A \Rightarrow A^{t} = -A \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
a & c\\
b & d
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-a & -b\\
-c & -d
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow b = -c,\,a = 0,\,d = 0.
\end{align*} Thus the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue $\lambda = -1$ is spanned by \begin{align*}
E_{-1} = \left\{\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1\\
-1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}\right\}
\end{align*} Since $E_{1}\cup E_{-1}$ is LI and it spans $M_{2\times 2}(\textbf{R})$ , we conclude that $\mathcal{B} = E_{1}\cup E_{-1}$ is a basis indeed. (d) The same reasoning applies to this case. Precisely speaking, there are $\displaystyle\dim\text{span}\{E_{1}\} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ symmetric matrices and $\displaystyle\dim\text{span}\{E_{-1}\} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ skew-symmetric matrices in the corresponding bases.

For $n=3$ , these equations are easy to solve: \begin{align*}
(1,2):\quad&\frac{a_1-a_3}{a_1+a_3}\cdot\frac{a_2-a_3}{a_2+a_3}=0\\
(1,3):\quad&\frac{a_1-a_2}{a_1+a_2}\cdot\frac{a_3-a_2}{a_3+a_2}=0\\
(2,3):\quad&\frac{a_2-a_1}{a_2+a_1}\cdot\frac{a_3-a_1}{a_3+a_1}=0.
\end{align*} Indeed we just get $a_1=a_2=a_3$ . For $n=4$ , the first of $6$ equations is $$(1,2):\quad\frac{a_1-a_3}{a_1+a_3}\cdot\frac{a_2-a_3}{a_2+a_3}+\frac{a_1-a_4}{a_1+a_4}\cdot\frac{a_2-a_4}{a_2+a_4}=0.$$ (For the other $5$ , just permute the indices.) I multiplied to clear the denominators, then added equations $(1,2)$ and $(3,4)$ to get $$4(a_1a_2-a_3a_4)^2=0$$ and thus $$a_1a_2=a_3a_4,\quad a_1a_3=a_2a_4,\quad a_1a_4=a_2a_3.$$ These imply that $a_1^2=a_2^2=a_3^2=a_4^2$ ; and we can't have $a_i=-a_j$ , again because of the denominators. So $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4$ . Does this continue for $n\geq5$ ? If the variables are non-negative real numbers, then we can arrange them in order, $a_1\geq a_2\geq a_3\geq\cdots\geq a_n\geq0$ ; equation $(1,2)$ is then a sum of non-negative terms, so each term must vanish, which gives $a_2=a_3=\cdots=a_n$ . Then equation $(2,3)$ has only its first term remaining, which gives $a_1=a_2$ . What if some of the variables are negative, or complex numbers? We might define $b_{ij}=\dfrac{a_i-a_j}{a_i+a_j}$ to simplify the equations to $\sum_kb_{ik}b_{jk}=0$ . Collecting these into an antisymmetric matrix $B$ , we see that the system of equations is just saying that $$BB^T=-B^2=B^TB=D$$ is some diagonal matrix. But I don't think this tells us enough about $B$ itself. The defining equation for $b_{ij}$ can be rearranged to $$a_j=\frac{1-b_{ij}}{1+b_{ij}}a_i$$ so in particular $$a_3=\frac{1-b_{13}}{1+b_{13}}a_1=\frac{1-b_{23}}{1+b_{23}}a_2=\frac{1-b_{23}}{1+b_{23}}\cdot\frac{1-b_{12}}{1+b_{12}}a_1;$$ cancelling $a_1$ , $$(1+b_{31})(1+b_{23})(1+b_{12})=(1-b_{31})(1-b_{23})(1-b_{12});$$ expanding, $$2b_{12}b_{23}b_{31}+2b_{12}+2b_{23}+2b_{31}=0.$$ In this process I divided by some things that might be $0$ , but this resulting cubic equation is valid nonetheless. I think we can dispense with $a_i$ now. In summary, we need to solve the system of equations \begin{align*}
\forall i,\forall j,\quad&b_{ij}+b_{ji}=0\\
\forall i,\forall j,\forall k,\quad&b_{ij}b_{jk}b_{ki}+b_{ij}+b_{jk}+b_{ki}=0\\

3734942,Is the composition of closed operators closed?,"Let $K,G,H$ be Hilbert spaces with $D_A \subseteq K$ , $D_B \subseteq G$ (possibly not dense) subspaces and let $A: D_A \rightarrow K$ and $B:D_B \rightarrow H$ be closed linear operators. Then is the linear operator $B \circ A: A^{-1}(D_B) \rightarrow H$ a closed linear operator? where $A^{-1}(D_B)$ denotes the preimage of the domain of $B$ . Claim: This is the case when $D_A$ is complete and $A$ is bounded (see e.g. here ). More generally, this is true when for any convergent sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ with $x_n \rightarrow x \in K$ we have $Ax_n \rightarrow y$ for some $y \in G$ . Proof of claim: Let $x_n \rightarrow x$ and $BAx_n \rightarrow y'$ for some $y' \in K$ . Then by assumption $Ax_n \rightarrow y$ . So since $A$ is closed, $x \in D_A$ and $Ax = y$ . But now since $B$ is closed and $Ax_n \rightarrow y$ and $BAx_n \rightarrow y'$ we have $y \in D_B$ and $y' = By = B A x$ , which proves the claim. So I suspect that the answer to the original question is negative, but I have not been able to construct a counter example. Partial answers and pointers to literature are very welcome.

3735458,Definition of a variety in category theory,"I want to define a variety in category-theoretic terms. First of all, we define a functorial scheme as in the first definition from ""Two functorial definitions of schemes"" . A variety over a field $k$ is normally defined as a reduced, irreducible and separated scheme of finite type over $k$ . First, I speak about irreducibility (this is from A functorial definition of a projective curve ). We define an affine space $\Bbb A^n_k$ as $k$ -scheme $\Bbb A^n_k$ such that $\Bbb A^n_k(R)=R^n$ (as in this paper from the arXiv ). We consider the coproduct of two of $\Bbb A^n_k$ (in the functor category), that is $\Bbb A^n_k \sqcup \Bbb A^n_k$ (i.e. disjoin union). A $k$ -scheme $X$ is said to be connected if there doesn't exists an epimorphism $X \rightarrow \Bbb A^n_k \sqcup \Bbb A^n_k$ , and then a scheme $X$ is said to irreducible if for every closed immersion (i.e. proper monomorphism by the valuative criterion for properness) $Z \rightarrow X$ we have $X\setminus Z$ is connected. Second, a separated scheme is as usual defined (for example, the nlab definition ). Let $f:X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes. Write $\Delta:X \rightarrow X \times_Y X$ for the diagonal morphism. The morphism $f$ is called separated if $Δ(X)$ is a closed subspace of $X\times_YX$ . A scheme $X$ is called separated if the terminal morphism $X \rightarrow \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ is separated. Third, a scheme of finite type over $k$ defined as a scheme with a finite cover of ring spectra (functors $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ ) of finitely generated $k$ -algebras $R$ (from version 2 of this MSE post ). Here $\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is the functor as following: $$\begin{array}{rrcl}
\operatorname{Spec}(R): & \textbf{Ring} & \to & \textbf{Set} \\
 & A & \mapsto & \operatorname{Hom}_{\textbf{Ring}}(R,A)
\end{array}$$ from ""The definition of an affine scheme using a functor"" and ""Two functorial definitions of schemes"" again. Finally, we want to define a reduced scheme. However the definition of a reduced scheme is the following: the local rings are reduced rings. Because we functorially define a scheme, we don't have directly local rings. My questions are: Can we define a reduced scheme in category-theoretic terms? And is this definition except for reduced correct? Thanks in advance!","['algebraic-geometry', 'category-theory']"

\int_{K_{12}}{f^-dV}>\int_{K_{11}}{f^+}dV-\left( l+1 \right) 
$$ We can remove the part on which $f^+>0$ from $K_{12}$ (This part can be open by the continuity of $f^+$ ),and then $K_{12}$ is still compact.The similar procedure should be acted on $K_{11}$ .And then let $K_1=K_{11}\cup K_{12}$ ,we have $$
\int_{K_1}{f}dV=\int_{K_1}{f^+}dV-\int_{K_1}{f^-}dV<l+1

3735834,A set as an algebraic structure,"A set is collection of distinct objects: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics) . The word distinct implies the identity relation on each set: an element of a set is equal to itself, or $a = a$ ( Does the word 'distinct' in the definition of Set implies an equivalence relation between the objects of the collection? ). Thus, every set by the definition is a relational structure with the identity relation . The identity relation is a binary relation $(a, a)$ that implies the unary identity operation $f(a) = a$ ( https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3719648/427611 ). Thus, every set by the definition is an algebraic structure with the identity operation . But Wikipedia states that a set is ""a degenerate algebraic structure S having no operations"" ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure#One_set_with_operations ). Which statement is correct? If a set is an algebraic structure, can we apply algebraic terms in set theory and vice versa? E.g., can we call equinumerous sets isomorphic ? Update Based on the discussion: The concept of an identity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy) is more fundamental, then the concept of a set. Without the concept of identity it is not possible to introduce a set, since if an element $a$ of a set $A$ is not equal to itself than the statements "" $a$ is an element of $A$ "" and "" $a$ is not an element of $A$ "" are true at the same time. Therefore, no matter how exactly we define a set, it has the identity relation. The binary identity relation ""an element is equal to itself"" is the unary identity operation ""an element is paired with itself"". Therefore, no matter how exactly we define a set, it is an algebraic structure with the identity operation. Would it be correct?

3735857,Help understanding a creative definition of the derivative based purely on integrals,"I am trying to understand section 3 of Here , titled ""what is a derivative"". At equation (3.2) Hestenes defines the derivation in relation to the integral, as follows: $$
\partial A =\lim_{d\omega\to0} \frac{1}{d\omega} \oint_{\partial \mathcal{M}} d\sigma A \tag{1}
$$ where $d\omega$ is a volume element. Hestenes suggests that this is a very good way to think of a derivative (perhaps even the best way). I am trying to apply this definition to the 1D case, but I am struggling to do so. Specifically, my goal is to start from (1) and obtain (2): $$
\frac{d A[x]}{d x} = \lim_{dx\to 0} \frac{A[x+dx]-A[x]}{dx} \tag{2}
$$ My thoughts and assumptions are as follows. Since we are dealing with the 1D case, should I be using $Cl_1(\mathbb{R})$ ; that is, the Clifford algebra of dimension 1 over the reals with basis element $\{\hat{\mathbf{x}}_1\}$ ? Hestene claims $d\omega$ is m-vector-valued differential; that is, it is a pseudo-scalar from the tangent space of $\mathcal{M}$ evaluated at point $x \in \mathcal{M}$ . In our 1D case, $d\omega=Idx=\hat{\mathbf{x}}_1 dx$ where I is the unit pseudoscalar of $Cl_1(\mathbb{R})$ $A$ is a function of $x$ . Thus, I write $A[x]$ . Hestenes claims that $\partial=\partial_x$ is the derivated with respect to a vector $x$ . In 1D, therefore $\partial_x=\partial/\partial x$ . Hestenes claims that $d\sigma$ is a (m-1)-valued pseudoscalar also in the tangent space of $\partial \mathcal{M}$ evaluated at point $x$ . I am not sure how to downgrade $\mathcal{M}$ to $\partial \mathcal{M}$ such that it is $0$ -dimensional? Am I supposed to consider $d\sigma$ as a pseudoscalar of $Cl_0(\mathbb{R})$ ? If so then is the answer just $d\sigma=dx$ ? Finally, Hestenes claims (starting from equation 3.2) that one needs $d\omega \wedge \partial =0$ in order to get to the geometric product. In 1D, why is $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_1dx \wedge \partial=0$ ? Is $\partial$ assumed in the tangent space of $\mathcal{M}$ and thus parallel to $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_1$ ? What becomes of the counter integral in 1D... does it collapses to a simple definite integral? I hope I dont have to integrate from a to b then from b to a to get back to the original point and thus to complete the ""contour"". If so then the integrals would simply cancel each other: $\oint_R f(x)dx = \int_a^b f(x)dx + \int_b^a f(x)dx=0$ ... that can't be good :( Since the left-most term of (1) is a derivative of A and the right-most term contains $A$ and not $A'$ , then I feel the contour integral in 1D must collapse to a non-integral in order to avoid raising A to its anti-derivative. What is $\partial \mathcal{M}$ for a 1D manifold $\mathcal{M}$ - I am assuming it is simply an interval $[x,x+h]$ , where h is an infinitesimal element?","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'clifford-algebras']"

One direction of the above is straightforward. Given that $S$ is a group with additive identity $0_S,$ consider an ideal $I$ of $S.$ Given any element $i \in I,$ by hypothesis that $S$ is a group, we have that $-i \in S.$ Consequently, we have that $$s = s + 0_S = s + (-i + i) = (s + (-i)) + i$$ is an element of $S + I.$ By assumption that $I$ is an ideal of $S,$ we have that $S + I \subseteq I,$ from which it follows that $s \in I.$ We conclude therefore that $S \subseteq I.$ Evidently, the reverse containment holds, so we find that $I = S.$ But this says precisely that the only ideal of $S$ is $S$ itself. Unfortunately, however, I am unable to prove the converse, i.e., I cannot show that if the only ideal of $S$ is $S$ itself, then $S$ is a group. Of course, there are many different equivalent conditions to show that a semigroup is a group, but my initial thought is that I could show that $S$ has an additive identity $0_S$ and additive inverses $-s$ for each of its elements. I have tried for a while to use the fact that for any nonempty subset $J$ of $S,$ we have that $J \cup (S + J)$ is an ideal of $S.$ Explicitly, I tried to show by way of contradiction that the set $I = \{s \in S \,|\, \forall t \in S, \, s + t = t \}$ is nonempty, but I got tied up in the negation, and I could not come up with a nonempty set $J$ such that $J \cup (S + J)$ is an ideal -- in which case, I could use the fact that $J \cup (S + J) = S.$ I would greatly appreciate any advice or assistance.

Thus, for $s=0$ I found that the solution is $$y_1(x)=a_0\sum_{j=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^j}{2^{2j}(2j+1)!}x^{4j}$$ I'm struggling to find the second solution. I tried to use two methods. The first one by using: $$y_2(x)=y_1(x)\int^x\frac{\exp\left[-\int^{x_2}P(x_1)dx_1\right]}{\left[y_1(x_2)\right]^2}dx_2$$ where $P(x)=\frac{3}{x}$ , but I dont know what to do with the term $[y_1(x)]^2$ . The second method I tried was to use the series form of the second solution that my book (Mathematical Methods for physicists, Arfken) gives by writing $P(x)=\sum_{i=-1}^\infty p_ix^i$ and $Q(x)=\sum_{j=-2}^\infty q_jx^j$ , replacing that in the integral form of the first method gives $$y_2(x)=y_1(x)\ln|x|+\sum_{j=-n}^\infty d_jx^{j+\alpha}$$ where $n$ is the difference between the two roots of the inditial equation and $\alpha$ is the higher root. When I tried this method, I replaced $y_2(x)$ in the original ODE usiing $n=2$ and $\alpha=0$ . After taking the derivatives and with the fact that $y_1(x)$ is a solution, I ended up with this: $$2\left(\frac{y_1(x)}{x}+y_1'(x)\right)+\sum_{j=-2}^\infty [j(j-1)+3j]d_j x^{j-1}+\sum_{j=-2}^\infty d_j x^{j+3}=0$$ The problem here is the term $2\left(\frac{y_1(x)}{x}+y_1'(x)\right)$ , I don't know what to do with it. In my book, they write it as a new power series, but I don't know how to determine the coefficients of such power series. I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to show a bit of the process I did, Hope you can help me. If it is necessary, I can upload an image of the whole process I did.","['frobenius-method', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3736302,Finding The Number Of The Solutions For $\cos x = \frac{x^2}{100}$,"Hello everyone how can I find the number of the solution to the equation: $\cos x = \frac{x^2}{100}$ in real numbers? I tried to convert it to function $y = \frac{x^2}{100} -\cos x$ and find all the cutting points with the x axis by find all the extreme points of y. $y' = \frac{x}{50}+\sin x$ I found 1 minimum point in $(0,-1)$ because of that I know that the equation have
at least two solutions.",['trigonometry']
3736314,A counterxample of a non-adapted process?,"I know that, given $\mathbb{I}\subset[0,\infty]$ , we call a stochastic process $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{I}}$ adapted to the filtration $\left(\mathcal{F}_t\right)_{t\in\mathbb{I}}$ if $X_t$ is for each $t\in\mathbb{I}$ an $\mathcal{F}_t$ -measurable random variable. At this point, I cannot figure out - even intuitively - an example of a stochastic process which is not adapted. If for example one considers natural times, with $t=2$ , how could it be possibile that the value of the r.v. $X$ at time $2$ , that is $X_2$ , is not $\mathcal{F}_2$ -measurable (that is, not measurable wrt the information set available up to time $2$ )? Could you please give me some counterexample?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'filtrations', 'random-variables']"
