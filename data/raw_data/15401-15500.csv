123430,Parametric quadratic function,"Everyone. I've been trying to solve this task for an hour now and I got pretty nervous so i had to ask for help. The task is to find the parameter $m$ ($m$ belongs to the set of real numbers) for which the function $$y=(m+1)x^2 + (m-5)|x| +m-2$$  has the function minimum for $x=1$. I tried to use $x=1$ in the function formula and then use canonical form of quadratic function to get $$\alpha =\frac{m-5}{2(m+1)}=-1$$  and the for $x>0$, the $m$ is $1$ and for the $x<0$ the $m=-1$. But I am not sure if this solution is correct since when I draw the function it doesn't look as it should.","['calculus', 'functions']"

For example, what is the standard basis for $\Bbb C^2$ (two-tuples of the form: $(a + bi, c + di)$)?  I know the standard for $\Bbb R^2$ is $((1, 0), (0, 1))$.  Is the standard basis exactly the same for complex numbers?

123449,How many squares does a line between two points pass through?,"Suppose I have a square, let's say the sides have length 1. I will then partition the square into $N^2$ sub-squares, where $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and the sub-squares are all the same size. Now, suppose we place two points $A$ and $B$ randomly within the large square a distance of $D$ apart from each other, and then draw the line segment $AB$. The question is, what is the expected number of small squares that $AB$ will pass through? I have no idea how to solve this analytically, and was thinking of attempting to get a sense using simulation, but was curious what I could learn about it here.

123454,Conditions for defining new metrics,"Suppose $(M,d)$ is metric. I have proven that if $\psi\colon[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ is non-decreasing, subadditive and satisfies $\psi(x)=0\iff x=0$ for $x\ge0$, then $$\rho(x,y)=\psi(d(x,y))$$ is a metric on $M$. But I want to `tweak' the restriction of this statement, I want to use differentiability of $\psi$. I found the following: Suppose $(M,d)$ is metric and $\psi\colon[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ is
  differentiable with continuous non-increasing derivative $\psi'$ and
  $\psi(0)=0$. Then $\psi$ is non-decreasing and subadditive. I have also proven this statement, but is $\rho=\psi(d(x,y))$ a metric in this situation? And if not, what is a sufficient condition on the derivative $\psi'$ to turn $\rho$ into a metric on $M$?","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"
123465,Do we really know the reliability of PrimeQ[n] (for $n>10^{16}$)?,"The algorithm Mathematica uses for its PrimeQ function is described on MathWorld . That web page says PrimeQ uses, ""the multiple Rabin-Miller test in bases 2 and 3 combined with a Lucas pseudoprime test."" It also says, ""As of 1997, this procedure is known to be correct only for all
  $n<10^{16}$, but no counterexamples are known and if any exist, they
  are expected to occur with extremely small probability (i.e., much
  less than the probability of a hardware error on a computer performing
  the test)."" More details on the algorithm are given in A Course in Computational Number Theory by David Bressoud . That book says there are 52,593 integers less than $10^{16}$ that are 2- and 3- strong pseudoprimes. It also suggests Lucas pseudoprimes less than $10^{16}$ are rare. Number theory is a very rigorous field. Has any rigorous work been done to substantiate the claim above that, if a PrimeQ counterexamples exist, they are expected to occur with extremely small probability. All I can find so far is an extrapolation of the trend for ($n<10^{16}$), and that is a very hand-wavy argument. Besides that, I am aware of no efforts to extend the brute force testing beyond $10^{16}$. With Moore's law and 15 years of work, considerable progress could have been made in that way.","['prime-numbers', 'mathematica', 'number-theory']"

123501,Does the asymptotic stability of a differential equation imply uniform boundedness?,"Consider the system of differential equations $$\dot{x}(t) = f(t,x)$$ where $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $f$ is a $C^{\infty}$ function. Suppose that every trajectory which begins in the closed unit ball tends to zero as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Does it follow that there exists a ball around the origin $\mathcal{B}$ such that every trajectory that begins in the unit ball stays in $\mathcal{B}$? My natural inclination is to think the answer ought to be yes and one should be able to show this by picking a convergent subsequence somehow. I'm having trouble making this work, however. Here is where I am stuck. Supposing $x_i(t)$ is a trajectory that begins from $x_i(0)$ at $t=0$ and has distance at least $i$ away from the origin at some later time; and supposing $\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} x_i(0) = x$; then I can't see how to derive a contradiction between the fact that the trajectory beginning from $x$ approaches zero, and is consequently bounded, and the the fact that $||x_i(t_i)||_2 \geq i$ for some $t_i$. If each $t_i$ was below some $T$ a contradiction is easy to obtain, but how to deal with $t_i$'s which blow up? Finally, this is not homework.",['ordinary-differential-equations']
123524,Fermat numbers are coprime,"So today in my final for number theory I had to prove that the Fermat numbers ($F_n=2^{2^n}+1$) are coprime. I know that the standard proof uses the following: $F_n=F_1\cdots F_{n-1}+2$ and then the $\gcd$ divides $2$, and it cannot be two, and hence the numbers are coprime. However, he asked us to use the hint: ""Let $l$ be a prime dividing $F_n$. What can you say about the order of $2$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/l\mathbb{Z})^\times$?""

123537,Any lower semicontinuous function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ on a compact set $K \subseteq X$ attains a min on $K$.,"I've been thinking about this problem for a long time right now, and feel stuck. Given that $X$ is a topological space, and that for $f$ to be lower semicontinuous, for any $x \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is a neighborhood of $x$ such that $f(x) - f(x') < \epsilon$ for all $x'$ in the neighborhood of $x$. Also, for the compact definition, I can only think of using every open cover of $K$ has a finite subcover for the topological definition of compact sets. I don't know where I went wrong, but I don't see where I used the fact of $K$ being compact. So I'll put what I did. Suppose that $\inf f(K)$ exists, then let's call it $a \in \mathbb{R}$. By the intermediate value theorem, we know that there exists some $x_0 \in X$ such that $f(x_0) = a$. So given that $f$ is lower-semicontinuous, then for $x_0 \in X$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is a neighborhood of $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) - f(x') < \epsilon$ for all $x'$ in the neighborhood of $x_0$. Note there is an open set in the neighborhood of $x_0$ that contains $x_0$. Then since $K$ is compact, there is a finite open subcover of $K$. So call this finite subcover of $K$, $J$ and call the open set that contains $x_0$, $L$. Hence, $J \cup L$ is an open cover of $K$ and $f$ attains a minimum on $K$. If the infimum of $f(K)$ does not exist, then we can't consider the case above. Take any $c \in f(K)$. Consider the set of the form $f_c := \{x \in X | f(x) \leq c\}$. Then we see each  $f_c$ is closed since $f$ being lower-semicontinuous implies $f^{-1}(-\infty,a]$ is closed for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$ and $f(K)$ being unbounded. For all $c \in f(K)$, we have that the intersection of all $f_c$ gives us that the intersection of the $f_c$ is closed. Not sure if this fact is in contrary of $K$ being compact. I got stuck here.","['measure-theory', 'semicontinuous-functions']"
123542,Factor $14x^2 - 17x + 5$.,"Objective: To factor general quadratic trinomials with integral coefficients. If $ax^2 + bx + c$, $(a>1)$ can be factored, the factorization will have the pattern
$$(px + r)(qx + s).$$
Factor $14x^2 - 17x + 5.$ Clue 1  Because the trinomial has a positive constant term and a negative linear term,
        both $r$ and $s$ will be negative. Clue 2  List the factors of the quadradic term $14x^2$ and 
        the negative factors of the     constant term, $5$ Factors of $14x^2  $ : $(x, 14x)$ and $(2x, 7x)$ Factors of $5$: $(-1, -5)$ and $(-5, -1)$ Test the possibilities to see which produces the correct linear term $-17x$. Since $(2x - 1)(7x - 5)$ gives the correct linear term, $$14x^2 - 17x + 5 = (2x - 1)(7x - 5).$$ My question is if the negative factors of the constant term, 5 are listed as $(-1, -5)$ and $(-5, -1)$, then why aren't the factors of the quadratic term $14x^2$ listed as $(x, 14x)$ and $(14x, x)$ and $(2x, 7x)$ and $(7x, 2x)$?

123544,Keyhole contour integration,"I would like to show that $\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\sin(ax)\exp(ibx)\over x}dx$ is equals to $\pi$ for $b\in (-a,a)$ and equals to $0$ otherwise. So I thought I shall use the keyhole contour integration, with a positively orientated contour in the upper half plane and having an indentation at $z=0$. Since $z=0$ is a simple pole, I can apply the indentation theorem which gives me (I believe) an arc integral of the indentation as $0$ and since my contour does not enclose any singularities, Cauchy's theorem suggests that the contour integral is $0$. Now I need to find the integral of the larger arc (of radius $R$, say) of the contour and find its limit as $R\to \infty$. But I don't quite know how.","['definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis']"

I observed that $\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\sin \frac {1} {3^{n}z}\rightarrow 0$ and also that $\left| \sin\frac {1} {3^{n}z}\right| \leq 1$ so if we replaced all the $sin\frac {1} {3^{n}z}$ parts we end up with a geometric series and since $|2| > 1$ and in such a case it would diverges, according to wolframalpha the series converges by ratio test so $\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\left|\frac {2^{n+1}\sin \frac {1} {3^{n+1}z}} {2^{n}\sin \frac {1} {3^{n}z}} \right| = \lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }\left|\frac {2\sin \frac {1} {3^{n+1}z}} {\sin \frac {1} {3^{n}z}} \right|$ here i am not sure how to simplfy the sin parts  further before taking the limit .

123797,Relationship between the weak law of large numbers and characteristic functions,"I'm trying to learn some probability theory atm and got stuck with the following exercise in Durrett's Probability: Theory and Examples : Exercise 3.3.17. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots $ be i.i.d. with characteristic function $\varphi$. If $\varphi'(0) = ia$ and $S_n = X_1 + \dots + X_n$, then $S_n/n\to a $ in probability. If $S_n/n\to a$ in probability then $\varphi(t/n)^n\to e^{iat}$ as $n\to \infty$. Use 2. and the uniform continuity of $\varphi$ to show that $(\varphi(h)-1)/h \to -ia$ as $h\to 0$. Thus the weak law holds if and only if $\varphi'(0)$ exists. I would really appreciate some help with the third part of this exercise (I don't quite see the connection between $\varphi(t/n)^n$ and $(\varphi(h)-1)/h$, yet). Thanks for your help! =) My thoughts on 1, 2 : I managed to prove 1. using the inequality $\mu\{x\, : \, |x|>u/2\} \le u^{-1} \int_{-u}^u (1-\varphi(t)) \, dt$, where $\mu$ is the pushforward measure of a random variable $X$ and $\varphi$ is its characteristic function. Using the fact that the ch.f. of $S_n/n - a$ is given by $e^{-iat}\varphi(t/n)^n$, this leads to $$P\left[\left|\frac{S_n}n - a\right| > 2/u \right]\le u^{-1} \int_{-u}^u (1-e^{-iat}\varphi(t/n)^n) \, dt$$ Now 1. implies $\varphi(t/n)^n \to e^{iat}$, so the RHS goes to zero as $n\to \infty$ for every fixed $u$. 2.: Using $|e^{i\epsilon t} - 1| \le 2\epsilon |t|$ for small enough $\epsilon>0$: \begin{align}
\left|\varphi (t/n)^n - e^{iat}\right| 
&= \left| E\left[e^{iS_n/nt} - e^{iat}\right]\right| \\
&\le E\left|e^{i(S_n/n - a)t} - 1\right| \\
&\le 2 \epsilon |t| + 2P[|S_n/n - a|> \epsilon]
\end{align} So $\limsup_{n\to\infty}\, \left|\varphi (t/n)^n - e^{iat}\right| \le 2\epsilon |t|$ and since $\epsilon>0$ was arbitrary (apart from being small) this proves $\varphi(t/n)^n\to e^{iat}$.",['probability-theory']

The probability that he makes a guess is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability that he copies the answer is $\frac{1}{6}$. The probability that his answer is correct, given that he copies it, is $\frac{1}{8}$ What is the probability that he knew the answer to the question, given that he correctly answers it? From the text I identified $3$ events regard to the same experience.So the sum of the $3$ probabilities must be $1$.It's known that: $P(A)=\frac{1}{3}$ $P(B)=\frac{1}{6}$ So, $P(C)+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}=1$ $P(C)=\frac{1}{2}$, this is the probability of knowing the answer. It's also known that $P(D|B)=\frac{1}{8}$. $P(D)$ is the probability of the question is correctly answered. The problem ask about $P(C|D)$. From the knowledge that $P(D|B)=\frac{1}{8}$, $P(B)=\frac{1}{6}$ and by the definition of conditional probability, it's known that $P(D \cap B)=\frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{6}$. This proves that $B$ and $D$ are indepentend events. And if the $P(B)$ it's known, the $P(D)$ must be $\frac{1}{8}$. Now, using the conditional probability definition, one can find $P(C|D)$.But if $D$ and $B$ were independent, and $C$ and $B$ are events of the same experience, than $C$ and $D$ must also be independents. So $P(C|D)=P(C)=\frac{1}{2}$ Is my thought right?",['probability']
123816,Is there a topology on the full transformation semigroup?,"$\mathscr T_X$ will denote the set of all functions from a non-empty set $X$ into itself, with the binary operation of composition $\circ$ making it a semigroup, called the full transformation semigroup on $X$. Is there a topology on the set $\mathscr T_X$ such that $\circ:\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X\longrightarrow \mathscr T_X$ is a continuous function with respect to the product topology on $\mathscr T_X\times \mathscr T_X?$ (i.e., is there a topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup?) Clearly, two (one if $X$ is a one-element set) topologies always work: the discrete and the indiscrete topology on $\mathscr T_X$ make the composition continuous as any function into an indiscrete space is continuous and any function from a discrete space is. (And the product of two discrete spaces is discrete.) I will call those two topologies trivial. These topologies don't seem useful at all, so I will re-write the question. Let $\operatorname{card}(X)>1.$ Is there a non-trivial topology on $\mathscr T_X$ making it a topological semigroup? (or at least, is there a construction of such a topology depending on $\operatorname{card}(X)$ which yields non-trivial topologies at least in some cases?) I cannot think of any general approach to this question and I think I may not have the tools -- I know virtually nothing about topological semigroups. I would be grateful for any help, be it in the form of a hint, a reference, or a full or partial answer to the question. Also, please don't hesitate to comment on anything even remotely related to this. Re Tara B's answer I may be mistaken but I think your example works only for finite sets. In general, I think, when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$ Let's say that in this situation, we call $A$ saturated and $S\setminus A$ prime. (I'm not sure if this is standard nomenclature, but I can imagine it might be.) Suppose a non-empty proper subset $A\subset \mathscr T_X$ is saturated. Then there is $\phi\cdot\operatorname{id}=\phi\in A$ and so $\operatorname{id}\in A.$ Let $\psi\in S_X.$ Then $\psi\psi^{-1}=\operatorname{id}\in A,$ and so $\psi\in A.$ Therefore $S_X\subseteq A.$ But also, let $\mathscr T_X\ni\chi\mathscr J\operatorname{id}.$ Then for some $\alpha,\beta\in\mathscr T_X,$ we have $\alpha\chi\beta=\operatorname{id}.$ Hence $\alpha\chi\in A,$ and so $\chi\in A.$ Therefore the $\mathscr J$-class $J_{\operatorname{id}}$ is contained in $A.$ But for an infinite set $X,$ we have the proper containment $S_X\subsetneq J_{\operatorname{id}},$ because there are functions from $X$ to $X$ whose rank is equal to $\operatorname{card}(X)$ but which aren't permutations. So $S_X$ cannot be saturated. I think for an infinite set $X$ there will be no such $A$ at all. I'm unable to prove this but I think we can obtain any function in $\mathscr T_X$ by composing functions in $J_{\operatorname{id}}.$ If that's true, then if $A$ were saturated, then it would be a subsemigroup containing a set generating the whole $\mathscr T_X$ and so $A=\mathscr T_X.$ $S_X$ clearly works for finite sets $X$ though. It's a subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ and its complement is an ideal because the composition of functions of which at least one doesn't have the maximal rank cannot have the maximal rank either. And for finite $X,$ a function $\phi: X\longrightarrow X$ is a permutation iff it has the maximal rank. I believe $S_X$ is the only saturated subsemigroup of $\mathscr T_X$ for $X$ finite. EDIT The statement ""when we have a semigroup $S$ and a non-empty proper subset $A\subset S,$ then $\{\emptyset, A,S\}$ forms a good topology iff the following two conditions are satisfied: $(1)$ $A$ is a subsemigroup of $S;$ $(2)$ $S\setminus A$ is an ideal in $S.$"" is false. When a semigroup isn't a monoid it may not be true. For example, Let $\mathbb N=\{1,2,\ldots\}$ be the additive semigroup of natural numbers. Let $A=\{1\}.$ Then $\{\emptyset,A,\mathbb N\}$ is a good topology on $\mathbb N,$ because the inverse image of $A$ under addition is empty. This is impossible in a monoid. It is also impossible in a monoid for the inverse image of $A$ to be equal $S\times S$ because the image of $S\times S$ under the semigroup operation is equal to $S.$ I have to think about it some more.","['general-topology', 'semigroups', 'functions']"

What I note was that subtracting the function by a constant, changing the sign in one entry, and permuting the entries preserve the isometric property. So we can assume $f(0,\ldots,0)=(0,\ldots,0)$. For any vector $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$, $\|f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)-(0,\ldots,0)\|=\|(a_1,\ldots,a_n)-(0,\ldots,0)\|$, so $\|f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\|=\max|a_i|$.

Actually, we could just as well take the algebra of all holomorphic functions (instead of polynomials only) with the standard derivative. However, there are more such functions. It was a homework assignment in my field theory class to prove that for any $f\in K[x]$ there is exactly one derivation $d_f:K[x]\longrightarrow K[x]$ such that $d_f(x)=f.$ This is an easy exercise and one easily sees that in particular, for $K=\mathbb C,$ the standard derivative is just $d_1.$ QUESTION I understand that I will soon be shown how such derivations can be used in algebra, and I can't wait to see that. But since it's a field theory class, I'm quite sure that nothing will be said about their meaning outside algebra. This is why I'm writing this. I would like to know $(a)$ whether the derivations $d_f$ on $K[x]$ I wrote about above have any interpretation connected to actually differentiating something (which I understand involves taking limits in some metric space) and what the interpretation is.

124002,Why doesn't integrating infinitesimally small likelihoods work in this sense?,"We know that something is going to happen after $x$ amount of time, but the exact time at which the event occurs is random within $x$ time. (Like, say we did it a bunch of times where it happened in $x-y$ time, and all the $y$s were uniformly distributed reals $0$ to $x$.) It is easy to see that you can compute the likelihood that the event has occurred by using $t/x$ with $t$ being the time that has elapsed and $x$ being the total amount of time.
It's also easy to see the likelihood of it occurring in the next $n$ amount of time by computing $n/(x-t)$ (With $t$ again being the amount of time elapsed) As $n$ gets very small, the likelihood of it happening in the next $n$ amount of time also clearly also becomes very small. This can be expressed by realizing that: $$\lim_{n \to 0}\frac{n}{x-t}=0$$ But now, if you take that limit and integrate it over some period of $t$ s.t. $0<t<x$, you should get $t/x$ again, since we're essentially adding up all the likelihoods of it happening at each instant in the interval: $$\int_{0}^{x-a} \lim_{n \to 0} \frac{n}{x-t} dt$$ Resolving the limit first clearly doesn't yield.

124039,How many primes does Euclid's proof account for?,"This is a passing curiosity, and I haven't found any duplicates, so I thought I'd share my thoughts. In the most basic (or at least the most famous) proof of the infinitude of prime numbers, due to Euclid, we have a finite set $\mathcal{P}_n = \{ p_1, \dots, p_n \}$ of primes and note that $p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$ must have a prime factor not in $\mathcal{P}_n$. (In fact, no prime factors of $p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$ lie in $\mathcal{P}_n$.) Suppose we set $p_1=2$ and, given $\mathcal{P}_n$, we choose $p_{n+1}$ to be the smallest prime dividing $p_1 \cdots p_n + 1$. I'm interested in finding out how many primes are picked up by this algorithm. Specifically, for each $n$ let $m_n$ be the largest prime in $\mathcal{P}_n$, and suppose $m_n$ is the $k_n^{\text{th}}$ smallest prime. I'm interested in finding the asymptotic behaviour of $k_n$ as $n \to \infty$. For instance, $\dfrac{n}{k_n}$ is the proportion of primes less than the largest prime picked so far which are accounted for after $n$ primes have been picked. Here are a few values: $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
n & p_n & m_n & k_n \\ \hline
1 & 2   & 2   & 1   \\
2 & 3   & 3   & 2   \\
3 & 7   & 7   & 4   \\
4 & 43  & 43  & 14  \\
5 & 13  & 43  & 14  \\
6 & 53  & 53  & 16  \\
7 & 5   & 53  & 16  \\
8 & 6221671 & 6221671 &  \approx 397715
\end{array}$$ I'm aware that $k_n \sim \dfrac{m_n}{\log m_n}$ as $n \to \infty$, so knowing how $m_n$ grows with $n$ might also do the trick. I suspect it grows quite fast. Another thing I'm curious about is whether every prime appears as $p_n$ for some $n$. Edit: I now know that it's an open problem to find out whether every prime appears as some $p_n$ (I've accepted Pantelis's answer pro tem), and that we barely know any terms in the sequence $(p_n)$, but I'm still interested to find out if any progress has been made in understanding the asymptotic behaviour of these sequences. After all, we understand the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of primes!","['prime-numbers', 'asymptotics', 'number-theory']"

  for all $x > 0$ and all $y > 0$.  If $f(1) = 3$, compute $f(x)$ for each $x > 0$. My initial thought was to use properties of the integral to write: $$\begin{align*} 
\int_1^{xy} f(t) dt & = \int_1^x f(t) dt + \int_x^{xy} f(t) dt \\
& = \int_1^x f(t) dt + x \int_1^y f(xt) dt

I cannot seem to pull an equation for $f(x)$ out of this though (I might be missing some very simple manipulation...). I also thought in terms of letting $A(x) = \int_1^x f(t)dt$, so the problem is giving us a functional equation:

Solution  Attempt Based on the upper bound of the partial sums are bounded as shown by Julián Aguirre
below and based on G.H.Hardy's test for uniform convergence which states that if, in a given domain, $\left| \sum _{n=1}^{p}a_{n}\left( z\right) \right| \leq k$ where $a_{n}\left(z\right)$ is real and $k$ is finite and independent of p and z, and if $f_{n}\left( z\right) \geq f_{n+1}\left( z\right) $ and $f_{n}\left( z\right)\rightarrow 0$ uniformly as $n\rightarrow \infty$, then $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }a_{n}\left( z\right) f_{n}\left( z\right) $ converges uniformly. Since $u_n\rightarrow 0$ and the sequence $u_0,u_1,u_2,...$ is monotonically decreasing. 
We also observed that the  partial sum is bounded so the series converges uniformly. 
Hence the series must converge. I am unsure how to attack the second part of the problem, to be more specific how the cos function varies when the parameter part is irrational. Any help would be much appreciated.","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

Note the ""only if"" direction is trivial. Folland suggests that we use the following fact in our proof: for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists an $x\in\mathcal{X}$ such that $\|x\|=1$ and $\|x+\mathcal{M}\|\ge 1-\epsilon$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a proper closed subspace of $\mathcal{X}$. I can prove both the hint, and the exercise, but not the latter using the former! My proof is to suppose (toward a contradiction), that there existed some sequence $\|x_n\|=1$ such that $f(x_n)>n$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and then consider the sequence $\{x-f(x)\frac{x_n}{f(x_n)}\} $ and observe that this is in the kernel of $f$ for each $n$ and approaches $x$ in the limit, from which the statement should follow since $x$ is arbitrary. Can anyone tell me how to use the hint? I'm guessing the closed subspace we consider is the kernel of $f$, but it's not clear how to go from there.

124161,Understanding why the positive bounded linear functionals on $C_0(X)$ are given by integration against finite Radon measures.,"Folland says in his chapter on the dual of $C_0(X)$ (continuous functions on $X$ vanishing at $\infty$ ): We recall that for any LCH space $X$ , $C_0(X)$ is the uniform closure of $C_c(X)$ , and hence if $\mu$ is a Radon measure on $X$ , the functional $I(f)=\int f\ d\mu$ extends continuously to $C_0(X)$ iff it is bounded with respect to the uniform norm . In view of the equality $$\mu(X)=\sup \big\{ \int f\ d\mu: f\in C_c(X), 0\le f\le 1 \big\}$$ together with the fact that $|\int f\ d\mu| \le \int |f|\ d\mu$ , this happens precisely when $\mu(X)<\infty$ , in which case $\mu(X)$ is the operator norm of $I$ . We have therefore identified the positive bounded linear functionals on $C_0(X)$ : they are given by integration against finite Radon measures. I feel like an idiot but I just can't seem to parse this passage. Can someone link me to another explanation of this?

B requires $g'(x) \not= 0$ on the closed set $[a,b]$ - why is this? $g$ itself isn't even defined on $[a,b]$ and actually we're not working on the extended reals so the following leads to trouble $g'(x) \not= 0 \forall x \in [-\infty,+\infty]$. C is somehow different Since $a$ isn't allowed to be $-\infty$ and $b$ is not allowed to be $+\infty$, C is not including the same functions as A and B. It requires differentiability and $g'(x) \not= 0$ on the closed set $[a,b]$ in contrast to A and B. It lacks the second case. So C only helps us, if we can't calculate the limit of $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ since $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=0$. We additionally get information about $g(x)$ on the half-open interval $]a,b]$.

124238,Need help computing the partial derivatives of a vector function.,"I need help computing the partial derivative shown below.  I've never taken a course in vector analysis so I'm not if my previous attempts at solving the problem were even on the right track.  If someone could show me step by step what to do, that would be a great help to me. I need to compute $$ \frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{X_{0}}}$$ where $$ f(X_{0},X_{1},X_{2}) =\frac{W_{u}}{\mid\mid W_{u} \mid\mid} $$ and $$ W_{u} = a(X_{1} - X_{0}) + c(X_{2} - X_{0} ) $$ All of the variables above denoted by capital letters are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.  I've been stuck on a couple of different aspects of this.  Firstly, is there a ""quotient rule"" for taking this type of derivative?  And does it work the same way as it does in single variable calculus?  I assumed that this was the case and went along with the problem however when I did this I eded up with an equation that didn't really make sense to me (matrices, vectors, and scalars added together).  If someone could please break down the process for solving this I would much appreciate it. Thanks!","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'vector-analysis', 'derivatives']"

124244,Showing that a curve is not rectifiable if its arc length is not a continuous function,"This is a (translated) proof from a textbook of the fact that arc length of a rectifiable curve is a continuous function. Let $\phi:[T_0,T_1]\rightarrow\mathbb C$ be a function whose real part and imaginary part are continuous, and $C$ be a curve represented by $\phi$. Suppose $C$ is rectifiable.  Define $f:[T_0,T_1]\rightarrow\mathbb R$ by $f(t) = L(C|[T_0,t])$, where $L(C|I)$ is the arc length of $C$ restricted to the interval $I$.  To show by contradiction that $f$ is continuous, assume $f$ is not continuous at $t_0\in [T_0, T_1]$.  Since $f$ is monotonously increasing, either of
  $
\lim_{t\rightarrow t_0-0} f(t) < f(t_0)
$ or $\lim_{t\rightarrow t_0+0} f(t) > f(t_0)$ holds. WLOG we may assume the former holds.  Here $t_0 > t$. Let $\epsilon_0 = f(t_0) - \lim_{t\rightarrow t_0-0}f(t)$.  By definition, there exists an infinite number of $t_j < \tilde{t_j} < t_{j+1} < \tilde {t}_{j+1}\quad(j = 1,2,\dots)$ s.t. $L(C|[t_j,\tilde{t}_j])>\epsilon_0/2$.  Then we have $L(C) = +\infty$.  Contradiction. I can't figure out why the sentence that begin with ""By definition"" is true.  Why are there such $t_j$'s? EDIT: In the book, $L(C)$ is defined to be the supremum (possibly $+\infty$) of $\sum_{j=1}^{n}|\phi(s_j)-\phi(s_{j-1})|$ for any partition $T_0 = s_0 < s_1 < \dots < s_n = T_1$.  $C$ is rectifiable iff $L(C) <\infty$.","['complex-analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"
124251,Associativity: why does $((a \ast b) \ast c) = (a \ast (b \ast c))$ mean we can bracket longer expressions however we like? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Closed 12 years ago . Possible Duplicate: How does one actually show from associativity that one can drop parentheses? In some ways this question seems obvious, but it is rarely covered.  The normal definition given for a binary operation $\ast$ on a set $S$ is that, for all $a,b,c \in S$: 
$$((a \ast b) \ast c)=(a \ast (b \ast c)) \tag{Assoc}$$ It is normal then to go straight from here to assuming that given any string of members of $S$, we can bracket them however we like.  For example, if we have the string $(a,b,c,d,e,f)$, where $a,b,c,d,e,f \in S$, then: 
$$\Bigl((a \ast b) \ast \bigl(c \ast ((d \ast e) \ast f)\bigr)\Bigr)=\Bigl(a \ast \Bigl(\bigl((b \ast c) \ast d\bigr) \ast (e \ast f)\Bigr)\Bigr).$$ We can prove this particular identity by repeated use of (Assoc): 
$$\begin{align*}
((a \ast b) \ast (c \ast ((d \ast e) \ast f))) &= (a \ast (b \ast (c \ast ((d \ast e) \ast f))))\\
&=(a \ast (b \ast (c \ast (d \ast (e \ast f)))))\\
&=(a \ast ((b \ast c) \ast (d \ast (e \ast f))))\\
&=(a \ast (((b \ast c) \ast d) \ast (e \ast f))).
\end{align*}$$ However, I am looking for a neat, formal proof for the general case.  This will involve coming up with some way of coding a 'bracketing'.  One thought I had was to write the string of things we are multiplying together as the ordered $n$-tuple $(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots ,a_n)$ and then considering the $(n-1)$-tuple of pairs of adjacent elements $(j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_{n-1})$ where $j_i=(a_i,a_{i+1})$.  Then we can order the $j_i$ to define a bracketing - for example, if we have $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$, the order $(j_2,j_3,j_1)$ corresponds to the bracketing $(a_1 \ast ((a_2 \ast a_3) \ast a_4))$ where we first bracket together around the second $\ast$, then around the third and then around the first.  The bracketing need not be unique to the ording of the $j_i$ - $(j_3,j_1,j_2)$ and $(j_1,j_3,j_2)$ both correspond to the bracketing $((a_1 \ast a_2) \ast (a_3 \ast a_4))$, but we have a surjective mapping from the set of orders of the $j_i$ to the set of bracketings.  The statement (Ass) above then corresponds to the statement that the product represented by $(\ldots,j_i,j_{i+1},\ldots)$ is the same as the product represented by $(\ldots,j_{i+1},j_i,\ldots)$.  We can write this as $(\ldots,j_i,j_{i+1},\ldots) \backsimeq (\ldots,j_{i+1},j_i,\ldots)$.  If we can show that this implies that any ordering $(j_{i_1},j_{i_2},\ldots,j_{i_n}) \backsimeq (j_1,j_2,\ldots,j_n)$ then we win. Has anybody got any ideas?",['abstract-algebra']

124268,"Gromov-Hausdorff distance and the ""set of all sets""","If $X$ and $Y$ are compact metric spaces, then the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{GH}(X,Y)$, describes how far $X$ and $Y$ are from being isometric. In the Wikipedia article on Gromov-Hausdorff distance , it is currently written: ""The Gromov–Hausdorff distance turns the set of all isometry classes of compact metric spaces into a metric space."" My naive attempt to do this rigorously immediately leads to the well-known issue that the ""set of all sets"" is not, in fact, a set. Googling led me to the MathOverflow question, ""When is something too big to be a set?"" In a comment under the accepted answer, Nate Eldredge wrote, ""a compact metric space has at most a certain cardinality, and so by fixing a set $S$ of that cardinality, any metric space is isometric to some metric on some subset of $S$."" But then Thierry Zell responded, ""even the definition of $d_{GH}$ requires you to consider all possible isometric embeddings of $X$ and $Y$ into all possible metric spaces, so the 'too big' issue already occurs at this level."" So my questions are these: What is the mathematically correct definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance? What is the mathematically correct theorem that corresponds to the heuristic notion that the set of all compact metric spaces is a metric space under $d_{GH}$?","['general-topology', 'logic', 'set-theory']"
124272,Degenerate critical points and higher order derivatives (Intuition),"The question I'd like to ask is about the relevance of higher order derivatives in determining the behaviour of a function around a critical point in the multivariate case. The question occurs towards the end and I am going to try to be clear about what I get and what I don't get. Now in a single variable case, we know from Taylor expansion around the critical point that $$\Delta y=\frac{1}{2}f''(x_{0})(x-x_{0})^2+R$$ where R is the remainder term which goes to zero one degree faster than the quadratic term, thus if $$f''(x_{0})=0$$, the behaviour around the critical point, i.e. the sign of $$\Delta y$$ is determined by the sign of the third derivative, assuming that its non zero and so on. In two variable case, we know from Taylor expansion around the critical point that $$\Delta y=\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0})(x-x_{0})^2+f_{xy}(x_{0},y_{0})(x-x_{0})(y-y_{0})+\frac{1}{2}f_{yy}(x_{0},y_{0})(y-y_{0})^2+R$$ Now if the determinant of the Hessian matrix is  strictly positive, then depending on the sign of $$f_{xx}$$, delta y is always positive or negative so we either have a local minimum or a local maximum. Similarly, if the determinant of the Hessian is strictly negative, then there are some (x,y) where the change is positive, and some (x,y) where the change is negative, so the critical point is a saddle point. Now what I don't get is, if the determinant is zero, then the polynomial becomes $$\Delta y=\frac{1}{2}f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0})((x-x_{0})+\frac{f_{xy}(x_{0},y_{0})}{f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0})}(y-y_{0}))^2+R$$ (completing the squares) for which the quadratic part is always positive or always negative, assuming that $$f_{xx}(x_{0},y_{0})$$ is non-zero (I don't have any problems with the case when it is zero). So how come the higher-order derivatives are relevant, since always positive or always negative implies local min or local max? The common explanation is that ""the derivative is degenerate in one direction so the behaviour in that direction is determined by the higher order terms"". I don't get this explanation from the expression above. Thanks. Note: I can get the intuition of the examples where partials drop down completely easily, i.e. for the ones where if you expand and take a Taylor expansion around (0,0), all the partials of second and third (or k-1th) order drops, so you are only left with the 4th (or kth) order term, which determines the behaviour of the function around (0,0). The examples that throw my intuition off are the ones (unfortunately, I can't provide an explicit function), where $$f_{xx}(critical)\neq 0,f_{yy}(critical)\neq 0,f_{xy}(critical)\neq 0 $$, but $$f_{xx}(critical)f_{yy}(critical)-f_{xy}(critical)^2=0$$. In those cases, the second order part of the Taylor expansion drops only partially, not completely. Is that because it loses part of it, it stops dominating the effects of higher order terms?","['multivariable-calculus', 'approximation', 'calculus']"

124320,Counterexamples in convergence in $M(X)$ and $C_0(X)$.,"I'm trying to get a good handle on analysis counterexamples as they relate to convergence in $M(X)$ and $C_0(X)$. Awhile back there was an excellent discussion of pointwise convergence, convergence in $L^p$ norm, weak convergence in $L^p$ and convergence in measure, here . How about a similar set of counterexamples for $M(X)$ and $C_0(X)$? Here we have the notions of vague convergence, weak* convergence, convergence in norm (where the norm of a complex Radon measure is its total variation). How about these counterexamples (asked in Folland or a variation therein): a) $\mu_n\to 0$ vaguely, but $\|\mu_n\|=|\mu|(X)|\nrightarrow 0$. b) $\mu_n\to 0$ vaguely, but $\int f\ d\mu_n\nrightarrow \int f\ d\mu$ for some bounded measurable $f$ with compact support. c) $\mu_n\ge 0$ and $\mu_n\to 0$ vaguely, but $\mu_n((-\infty,x])\nrightarrow \mu((-\infty,x])$ for some $x\in\mathbb{R}$. d) $\{f_n\}\in C_0(X)$ converges weakly to some $f$, but not pointwise. Any links to conceptual ways of internalizing these different notions of convergence, in addition to providing counterexamples, would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: Let me define the notions of convergence as Folland does: Vague convergence means convergence with respect to the vague topology on $M(X)$, which is also known as the weak* topology on $M(X)$, which means that $\mu_\alpha\to \mu$ iff $\int f\ d\mu_\alpha\to \int f\ d\mu$ for all $f\in C_0(X)$. Weak convergence means that convergence on $X$ with respect to the topology generated by $X^*$. The norm on $M(X)$ is given by the total variation , so that $\|\mu\|=|\mu|(X)$, so that convergence with respect to this norm means that $|\mu_n-\mu|(X)\to 0$. Incidentally I find it awkward working with the total variation in such discussions of convergence because there is no clear geometry to work with as far as I can tell; the definition is rather too abstract for me at the moment.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
