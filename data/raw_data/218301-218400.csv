4457691,Is $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})/\mathbb{R}^{\times}$ isomorphic to $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$?,"Let $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of real $2\times 2$ invertible matrices (where the operation is matrix multiplication). It has $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})=\{ A \in \text{GL}_2(\mathbb{R}| \det A = 1)$ as a normal subgroup. Similarly, let $\text{gl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ be the set of real $2\times 2$ matrices (where the operation is matrix addition). It has $\text{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})=\{ A \in \text{gl}_2(\mathbb{R}| \text{tr} A = 0)$ as a normal subgroup. It is standard to show that $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})\cong\mathbb{R}^{\times}$ and $\text{gl}_2(\mathbb{R})/\text{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})\cong\mathbb{R}^+$ . Recently I saw that the surjective homomorphism $\text{gl}_2(\mathbb{R})\to\text{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ given by $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}\mapsto 
\begin{pmatrix} a - d & b \\ c & d - a \end{pmatrix}$$ has a kernel isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^+$ , allowing us to write $\text{gl}_2(\mathbb{R})/\mathbb{R}^+\cong\text{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ . All the above begs the question: is there a surjective homomorphism $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})\to\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ with kernel isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{\times}$ ?

4457867,Why is there a 1/2 coefficient for the curvature formula in the Wikipedia Curvature Form article?,"The formula for the principal curvature form in the Wikipedia article Curvature Form, when applied to the $X, Y$ tangent vectors to the principal bundle $P$ , goes on like $$\Omega(X, Y)=d\omega(X, Y)+\frac12[\omega(X), \omega(Y)]$$ where $\omega$ is the connection form with value in the lie algebra of the structure group. It only depends on the lie bracket of the lie algebra, not on any conventional definition of the wedge product of forms Having learned that there is no $\frac12$ coefficient, I was about to edit the article when I saw a caveat from the authors ""do not remove the $\frac12$ coefficient"". They did motivate its presence by a correct calculation made from the definition given in the article Lie-Algebra Valued Forms of Wikipedia where there is a $\frac1{(p+q)!}$ coefficient in front of the definition of the wedge product of two lie-algebras valued forms. This definition is different from the one I saw in Michor's book Natural Operations in Differential Geometry, Cap. 19, or other textbooks, where the coefficient is $\frac1{p!q!}$ . This explain the difference in the formula for the curvature. What is right? It seems to me that there should be no such a coefficient $\frac12$ and that I should edit the article on Lie-Algebra Valued Forms. Am I right? Edit 2 Well, the only explanation that makes sense for me is the following: the authors of the article are using an ""old"" convention for the definition of the exterior derivative of a one form, following there the one given in the Kobayashi & Nomizu book they referred to in a note. In this book, the convention used put a $\frac1{p+1}$ in front of the definition of the exterior derivative of a $p$ -form compare to the ""modern"" definition. So, for the connection form , we have a $\frac12$ coefficient in the formula $$d\omega(X,Y)=\frac12(X.\omega(Y)-Y.\omega(X)-\omega([X,Y]))$$ With this convention, it is easy to see that the formula for the curvature given in the Wikipedia article is right, albeit giving a curvature that is half of the modern definition for it. Having two competing definitions for such an important and basic operator is a source of confusion and waste of time IMHO. I will definitely go for the ""modern"" approach. Thus, I just edited the wikipedia article with a reference to the choice of convention made for the exterior derivative definition, following my answer. It seems so me the safest path of action, since getting rid of the $\frac12$ coefficient would have implied a change in other articles. Therefore, my remaining questions are now
1/ is my reasoning right?
2/ is there any rationale behind the choice of the Kobayashi convention for the exterior derivative versus the modern one or is it just a matter of convention? In any case, the choices of some wikipedia articles (like Curvature Form, or Lie-Algebra Valued form, etc.) of the Kobayashi convention is confusing when it is not clearly specified.","['principal-bundles', 'curvature', 'differential-geometry']"
4457875,Prove that $\nu$ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. $\mu$ iff $\sum \alpha_j^2<\infty$,"This is question 3 in Chapter 4.12 from Barry Simon - Real analysis I tried to define $ f_j : \{0,1\} \to \mathbb{R} $ where $n$ means that it is a function from $j$ th $\{0,1\}$ in the product to $\mathbb{R}$ . It is given by $$ f_j(0)=2p_j \ \ \ f_j(1)=2(1-p_j)$$ Finally, let $f=\otimes f_j$ which gives me, by Kolmogorov Consistency Theorem, $d\nu=fd\mu$ (???). But, I believe this is wrong or I am missing something because I didn't even use the assumption. Idea behind defining $f_j$ in this way was, consider $\{0,1\}^N$ then for example for the point $(1,1,...1)$ the integral gives ( $f^N=\otimes_{j=1}^N f_j$ ) $$ \int_{\{(1,1,...,1)\}}f^N(x)d\mu(x)=\prod_{j=1}^N \frac{1}{2}2(1-p_j)=\int_{\{(1,1,...,1)\}}d\nu(x) $$ Then I tried to find counter example but I couldn't even find a counter example for the case $\alpha_j=1/4$ for all $j$ .

4457927,What does it mean when a chern class of a vector bundle is postive(resp. negative)?,"Recently i was studying line bundles on $\mathbb{C}P^1$ . Here is my confusion:

Then $f^*E$ split into direct sums of $r$ line bundles $L_1\oplus\cdots \oplus L_r$ (Why??? any reference to this?)

4457935,Gorenstein's proof of the classification of solvable CN-groups,"I am reading Gorenstein's Finite Groups . Chapter 14 is about CN-groups , a (finite) group where the centralizer of every non-identity element is nilpotent. Theorem 14.1.5 gives the classification of solvable CN-groups , which states that any such group is either (i) nilpotent, (ii) a Frobenius group whose complement is either cyclic or the product of an odd cyclic group with a generalized quaternion group, or (iii) a 3-step group . A 3-step group $G$ is a group that satisfies all of: (a) $O_{p,p'}(G)$ is a Frobenius group with kernel $O_p(G)$ and odd cyclic complement; (b) $G = O_{p,p',p}(G)$ and $G$ strictly contains $O_{p,p'}(G)$ ; (c) $G/O_p(G)$ is a Frobenius group with kernel $O_{p,p'}(G)/O_p(G)$ . I feel like there is a gap in Gorenstein's proof of this classification theorem. In high level, the proof proceeds as follows. Let $G$ be a solvable CN-group and let $F=F(G)$ be its Fitting subgroup. If $F=G$ , then $G$ is nilpotent and we are done (case (i)). Otherwise, let $\pi=\pi(F)$ be the set of primes dividing $|F|$ . Since $G$ is solvable, then $G$ has a Hall $\pi'$ -subgroup $A$ ( $\pi'$ denotes the primes dividing $G$ but not $F$ ). Then we show that $A$ acts regularly on $F$ and hence $FA$ is a Frobenius group if $A \ne 1$ . Next, we show that $A$ is nilpotent. Then, by properties of Frobenius complements, $A$ must be one of the alternatives described in case (ii). Now if $G = FA$ , then we are done (case (ii)). Otherwise, if $G$ properly contains $FA$ , we show that $\pi(F)$ consists of a single prime $p$ , i.e., $F$ is a $p$ -group. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$ -subgroup of $G$ . Then $P$ necessarily contains $F$ , and $G = PA$ . Note that $A$ is a $p'$ -group and $F = O_p(G)$ . We may assume $A \ne 1$ else we would be in case (i). Next, we write $\overline{G} = \overline{P}\mbox{ }\overline{A}$ where the bars denote reduction modulo $F = O_p(G)$ . Gorenstein shows that no nontrivial element of $\overline{P}$ can centralize a nontrivial element of $\overline{A}$ . Then Gorenstein claims that $\overline{P}$ acts regularly on $\overline{A}$ which establishes the necessary 3-step group structure of $G$ for case (iii) where $\overline{G}$ is a Frobenius group with kernel $\overline{A}$ and complement $\overline{P}$ . Here we use the restricted structure of $A$ already established above; note that $\overline{A} \cong A$ since $A$ is a $p'$ -group and $F$ is a $p$ -group. To me, it looks like there is a gap in this last step. The problem is that I don't see anywhere it is shown that $\overline{P}$ has to act on $\overline{A}$ at all, i.e., why is $\overline{A}$ a $\overline{P}$ -invariant subgroup? Equivalently in the original group, why $FA$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ ? It appears that we are claiming that $FA = O_{p,p'}(G)$ in order to establish the 3-step group structure, but $O_{p,p'}(G)$ is clearly a normal subgroup of $G$ and I don't see how to prove that $FA$ must be. Can anyone help me understand this step?","['group-theory', 'finite-groups']"

4457966,"Is there a smooth strictly-increasing bijection $\mathbb{R} \to (0, 1)$ that maps $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0, 1)$?","I noticed that none of the ""nice"" sigmoid functions I know of sends rationals to rationals. I set out to find a sigmoid function that maps rationals into rationals.  I did find one, but it is not smooth.  I wonder if such a function exists, and if not, what is the connection between this non-existence and the requirement that it and its inverse map rationals to rationals. The function $$
x \mapsto
\begin{cases} 
      \frac{1}{2 (1 - x)} &, \text {if} \ \ x < 0 \\
      \frac{2 x + 1}{2 (1 + x)} &, \text {if} \ \  x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$ is a strictly increasing bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ onto $(0, 1)$ , and it maps $\mathbb{Q}$ into $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0, 1)$ . Furthermore, its inverse $$
y \mapsto
\begin{cases} 
      \frac{2 y - 1}{2 y} &, \text {if} \ \  0 < y < \frac{1}{2} \\
      \frac{2 y - 1}{2 (1 - y)} &, \text {if} \ \  \frac{1}{2} \leq y < 1
\end{cases}
$$ maps $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0, 1)$ into $\mathbb{Q}$ . Therefore, the restriction of this function to $\mathbb{Q}$ is a monotone bijection from $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0, 1)$ . The original function (over $\mathbb{R}$ ) is not smooth, however: its second derivative does not exist at $x = 0$ . Does there exist a smooth monotone bijection from $\mathbb{R}$ onto $(0, 1)$ whose restriction to $\mathbb{Q}$ maps $\mathbb{Q}$ onto $\mathbb{Q}\cap(0, 1)$ ?  Is it possible to write down a formula for it? EDIT: Below is the function one gets if one subtracts $\frac{1}{2}$ from the expressions in the original definition. $$
x \mapsto
\begin{cases} 
      \frac{x}{2 (1 - x)} &, \text {if} \ \ x < 0 \\
      \frac{x}{2 (1 + x)} &, \text {if} \ \  x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$ (Informally, this ""translates"" the graph of the function down by $\frac{1}{2}$ , so that the function's value at $0$ is $0$ .) This ""translate"" of the original function more clearly shows its symmetry. EDIT2: I realized after the fact that the word ""monotone"" in the phrase ""smooth monotone bijection"" is probably redundant.  I cannot envision a smooth bijection on $\mathbb{R}$ that fails to be monotone.

4458016,"$\sum_{A\in2^\Omega}P(A)=2^{|\Omega|-1}$ for probability space $(\Omega,2^\Omega,P)$ with finite $\Omega$","I'm looking for a combinatorial argument to complete a proof (below) of the following: Claim : If $(\Omega,2^\Omega,P)$ is a probability space with finite $\Omega,$ then $\sum_{A\in2^\Omega}P(A)=2^{|\Omega|-1}.$ In other words, if $\Omega$ is finite and every subset of $\Omega$ is considered an event, then the sum of all the event-probabilities must equal $2^{|\Omega|-1}.$ Proof:
Let $\Omega=\{\omega_1,...,\omega_n\}$ and $p_i=P(\{\omega_i\}).$ Then, by summing over subsets of successively larger size, $$\begin{align*}&\sum_{A\in\cal 2^\Omega}P(A)\\

4458069,Does a torsion-free coherent sheaf embed into a locally free sheaf?,"Let $ X $ be a Noetherian integral regular scheme and $ \mathcal{F} $ be a torsion-free coherent sheaf.

In general, care has to be taken when the scheme is not integral.) Question 1: Is it true that $ \mathcal{F} $ always embeds into a locally free sheaf? Some things I can do: If $ X $ is a smooth projective variety say over the complex numbers, then this is true. Indeed, being torsion-free implies that $ 
\mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{F}^{\vee \vee} $ is an injection. Now by Serre's theorem, a high enough twist of $ \mathcal{F}^{\vee} $ is globally generated, that is, there is a surjection $ \mathcal{O}_X^p \rightarrow \mathcal{F}^{\vee} (n) $ for $ n $ a large number. Tensoring by $ \mathcal{O}_X(-n) $ and dualizing gives an injection $ \mathcal{F}^{\vee \vee} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_X(n)^p $ and now just compose the two injections to finish the proof. This proof can be adapted if we replace projective by quasi-projective. Question 2: Is it true that $ \mathcal{F} $ always embeds into a locally free sheaf of rank equal to the rank of $ \mathcal{F} $ ?

I'm convinced that this is likely a solved combinatorics question, but I don't have the mathematical background to know how to ask it formally. Allow me to explain. DNA has four nucleotide bases: A T G C. A dinucleotide sequence is just any sequence to two nucleotides, so AT, GC, TT, etc. There are of course 16 possible dinucleotide sequences. (Direction matters, so for instance GC and CG are different dinucleotides.) I'm searching for minimal sequences that contain every one of those 16 dinucleotide sequences exactly once. I know this one: ACGTTAGCTGGATCCAA It is 17 nucleotides long, and each of the 16 adjacent pairs of nucleotides is unique. This is what I'm looking for. I also know that I can make more such sequences by circular permutation of this sequence. My question is, how would I count all such sequences? How would I construct a list of all such sequences?","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'biology']"

Let $i : C \rightarrow X \times_k \overline{k}$ be a closed immersion where $C$ is a reduced curve. Then, we want to prove $deg(i^* M) =0$ .

4458268,Haar measure on isomorphic subgroups,"Let $G$ be an abelian locally compact Hausdorff group endowed with a chosen Haar measure $\mu$ . Moreover, let $H,N$ be subgroups of $G$ where $N$ is discrete. Then we have the isomorphic quotient groups $$\frac{(H+N)}{N}\cong\frac{H}{H\cap N}.$$ If we put the natural counting measure on the discrete subgroups, then we get a unique induced measure on the quotient. Now I wonder whether the groups in the isomorphism have the same volume under the canonical measures? Or maybe a better formulation is, whether the pushforward measure induced by the canonical measure on the left hand side coincides with the canonical measure on the right hand side? Edit: We assume that the restricted measure on $H$ is nonzero, and therefore a Haar measure. On $N$ we denote the measure by $\lambda$ , and on $H\cap N$ the restricted measure by $\lambda_{H}$ . On $G$ we have the measure $\mu$ , and on the quotient $G/N$ the measure $\nu_{N}$ . The unique induced measure on $G/(H\cap N)$ is denoted by $\nu_{H}$ . We want to show that $\nu_{N}((H+N)/N) = \nu_{H}(H/(H\cap N))$ (if it is true). I guess that if this it true, one needs the quotient integral formula. But I dont exactly see how to obtain it here. $$\nu_{N}((H+N)/N)=\int_{G/N}\chi_{(H+N)/N}(x)\mathrm{d}\nu_{N}(x)$$ $$\nu_{H}((H/(H\cap N))=\int_{G/(H\cap N)}\chi_{H/(H\cap N)}(x)\mathrm{d}\nu_{H}(x),$$ where the integrands are the characteristic funtions. The reason why I think the quotient integral formula is needed, is that the measure on $H\cap N$ is just the restriction of the measure on $N$ . And therefore you might get a nice equality when you can write the integral $$\int_{G/N}\chi_{(H+N)/N}(x)\mathrm{d}\nu_{N}(x) = \int_{G/N}\int_{N}f(yn)\mathrm{d}\lambda\mathrm{d}\nu_{N}(yN),$$ for some integrable $f$ .","['group-theory', 'measure-theory', 'borel-measures']"

As far as I've understood the explanation, we used a $C^2$ diffeomorphism and I don't understand how it's non-existence implies the non-existanece of a $C^1$ diffeomorphism. Here it goes, verbatim from Croatian: Using differential $1$ - froms, we can show certain subsets of $\Bbb R^2$ aren't diffeomorphic. $\underline{\boldsymbol{\text{example } 17.33}:}$ For $c\in\Bbb R^2,$ and $0<r<s$ let's denote by $B(c,r)$ and $B(c,r,s)$ the open disc centered at $c$ of radius $r$ and open circular annulus centered at $c$ with the inner radius $r$ and outer radius $s$ respectively. Since $B(c,r)$ is convex (and in particular, it's a 'star-like' set), every closed differential $1$ -form of class $C^1$ on $B(c,r)$ is exact. On the other hand, there are closed differential $1$ -forms on $B(c,r,s)$ which aren't exact. Namely, for $c=(c_1,c_2),$ let $\omega_c$ denote the angular form centered at $c$ : $$\omega_c=\frac{-(y-c_2)dx+(x-c_1)dy}{(x-c_1)^2+(y-c_2)^2}.$$ Then, $\omega_c$ is a well defined $1$ -form on $B(c,r,s)\subset\Bbb R^2\setminus\{c\}$ and $d\omega_c=0,$ (that is, $\omega_c$ is closed). On the other hand, for $p=\frac{r+s}2$ let $\gamma:[0,2\pi]\to B(c,r,s)$ be a parametrization of the circle $\{(x,y)\in\Bbb R^2\mid\|x-c\|=p\}\subset B(c,r,s)$ defined by $\gamma(t)=(c_1+p\cos t,c_2+p\sin t).$ Then, $\begin{aligned}&\color{white}=\int_\gamma\omega_c\\&=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{-p\sin t(-p\sin t)+p\cos t(p\cos t)}{(p\cos t)^2+(p\sin t)^2}dt\\&=\int_0^{2\pi}dt=2\pi\end{aligned}$ Suppose there exists a $C^2$ diffeomorphism $\boldsymbol F:B(c,r)\to B(c,r,s).$ Then, it would hold, $$\int_{\boldsymbol F^{-1}\circ\gamma} \boldsymbol F^*(\omega_c)=\int_\gamma\omega_c=2\pi\tag 1$$ Since the pullback and the differential commute, $\boldsymbol F^*(\omega_c)$ a is closed $1$ -form on $B(c,r)$ and hence exact. Since $F^{-1}\circ\gamma$ is a closed path in $B(c,r),$ $$\int_{\boldsymbol F^{-1}\circ\gamma}\boldsymbol F^*(\omega_c)=0,$$ which is a contradition with $(1)$ . In a lemma where we've proven that the pullback and the differential of a $1$ -form commute, there was an assumption on $\boldsymbol F$ being a $C^2$ diffeomorphism and in the proof by brute-force computation, we recalled the Schwarz theorem which requires continuous second derivatives. I believe, for the same reason, $\boldsymbol F$ is said to be of class $C^2$ in the above example. However, I'm missing why this example proves the two sets aren't diffeomorphic. I thought we should prove there isn't a $C^1$ -diffeomorphism $\boldsymbol F:B(c,r)\to B(c,r,s),$ and, indeed, I found, only the text, of the same task in an old exam where it is explicitly stated one should prove there isn't a $C^1$ diffeomorphism. I see the converse is true by contrapositive, but I can't grasp how we know there isn't a $C^1$ -diffeomorphism based on the non-existence of a $C^2$ -diffeomorphism. Is there a fallacy in this approach, or does the pullback not require a $C^2$ -diffeomorphism $\boldsymbol F$ in order to commute with the differential? $\boldsymbol{\text{ P.

\int_{\mathbb R} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{tf(x)} e^{-(x-t)^2/2} dx = 1.

@Cretin2 Thanks for the suggestion.
The density of $Y=f(X) + X$ is $$p_Y(y) = \sum_{x:f(x)+x=y} \frac{p_X(x)}{|f'(x) + 1|},$$ which is reduced to $$ \sum_{x:f(x)+x=y} \frac{e^{f(x)(y-f(x)/2)}}{|f'(x) + 1|} = 1,$$ for any $y\in\mathbb R$ . If $f(x)+x$ is not monotone, then there is some point $x_0 < x_1$ such that $f'(x_0) + 1= 0$ and $h:(x_0,x_1)\to\mathbb R, x\mapsto f(x)+x$ is injective. As $y\to h(x_0)$ , $$\frac{e^{f(h^{-1}(y)) (y - f( h^{-1}(y) )/2) }}{|f'(h^{-1}(y)) + 1|} \to \infty,$$ a contradiction. Then $f(x)+x$ must be monotone and $f$ must be linear.

Plugging this in, we arrive at the ODE for $v$ : $$-v = -\frac 12 v'' - v^3$$ Which we can rewrite as: $$\frac 12 \left((v')^2\right)' = v'\partial_v (v^2 - \frac 12 v^4)$$ Integrating both sides (and using B.C. vanishing at $\pm \infty$ ), we arrive at: $$\frac{dv}{dx} = \pm\sqrt{2 v^2 - v^4} $$ Rewriting, we have: $$\int \frac{dv}{\sqrt{2v^2 - v^4}}= -\frac{\tanh ^{-1}\left(\sqrt{1-2 v^{2}}\right)}{\sqrt{2}} = \pm x + c_0$$ For a positive soliton centered at the origin, we then have: $$v(x) = \sqrt{2}\operatorname{sech}(\sqrt{2}\cdot x)$$ Now, going back to the defocusing case, if we likewise propose an ansatz of the form $u = v(x) e^{it}$ where $v(x)$ vanishes at $\pm \infty$ , we have $v(x)$ solves the ODE: $$v + v^3= \frac 12 v''$$ But multiplying both sides by $v$ and integrating on $\mathbb R$ , we have: $$\int_\mathbb{R} v^2 + v^4 + \frac 12 v'^2 dx = 0 \implies v(x) = 0$$ Hence, for this case, there is no such non-trivial solution of this ODE if $v$ is real. Now, my question is this: is there an alternative ansatz I can use here for the defocusing case that would yield an analogous result to the focusing case? Indeed, if we try: $v(x) = i \sqrt{2} \operatorname{sech}(\sqrt{2} \cdot x)$ this solves the ODE, but it fails for the ansatz (it is not real, so the $ | \cdot |^2$ term causes issues).","['physics', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

\left. \pi\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{k!}( e^{-\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}} )^{(k)} \right|_{a=1}$$ By Wolframalpha , we have $$
\frac{\partial^{k} e^{-1 / \sqrt{x}}}{\partial x^{k}}=e^{-1 / \sqrt{x}} x^{-k} \sum_{j=0}^{k} \sum_{i=0}^{j} \frac{(-1)^{i}\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right)^{j}\left(\frac{1}{2}(2+i-j-2 k)\right)_{(k)}}{i !(j-i) !}

4460045,How to make calculations for a complex 3-D conduit shape?,"I'm an electrician running conduit horizontally along a wall at a height of 6 feet off the floor, when I come to a corner of the room. Normally, I would bend a 90-degree elbow and continue level along the adjacent wall, but there are complications. In the corner, a vertical pipe, 7-inches outside diameter, is running from floor to ceiling. No problem, I would normally change strategies and use a double 45 (45+45) to cut neatly in front of the pipe to the adjacent wall. However, there is a locker with a shelf above it on the adjoining wall that the conduit will need to rise above. The top of the shelf is at 6'10"", but I would like to rise to the 7-foot level mark. And I want to do all of this in only two (2) bends! I want the shape of the conduit through this corner, from a top view, to appear as a simple 45+45 inside corner, though I realize the hypotenuse of the triangle will actually be stretched out in order to make the 12"" rise. Here are some rough sketches of what I mean. First Question: If I use 45-degrees for the first bend, How do I calculate the distance from the adjacent wall to make the first bend in order for the conduit to pass just in front of the pipe? (assume the 7-inch pipe is tight up against both walls) Second Question: How do I calculate the length of my inclined hypotenuse? Third Question: If I make the first bend at 45-degrees and begin rolling the conduit toward the shelf, the conduit will need to be rotated in my bender out of the plane of the two legs of the first bend to correct the run back to level. How do I calculate the degree of rotation out of plane I should rotate before making the second 45-degree bend? Fourth Question: Or am I wrong to assume two 45-degree bends can accomplish all of this? If so, what degrees would I need to use? [Notes: I'm not sure these facts matter, but my conduit is approximately 3/4"" in diameter, and the bend radius of the bender is 4-5/16"". I do not yet understand how to use radians, but usually working with degrees in regular trigonometry has been close enough for conduit bending.]","['trigonometry', 'vectors', 'applications']"

Then the limit $\lim_{s\to 0} s F(s)$ exists, and $\lim_{t\to\infty} f(t) = \lim_{s\to 0} s F(s)$ . Critically, there is no a priori explicit assumption that the limit $\lim_{t\to\infty} f(t)$ exists; it follows as a consequence of the assumptions made on $s F(s)$ . The standard proof uses partial fraction decomposition, which requires assuming $F(s)$ is a rational function. Is there a more general version of this result that can handle the cases where: $F(s)$ may have infinitely many poles $F(s)$ may not be rational I want to preserve the property that no assumptions are made about $f(t)$ or its limiting behavior.

Show that the action of $G$ on $A$ extends to an action on $S^{-1} A$ , and that $(S^G)^{-1} A^G \cong (S^{-1} A)^G$ . The piece that I am stuck on is proving that $(S^G)^{-1} A^G \cong (S^{-1} A)^G$ . I have tried two approaches: Using the universal property of localizations, and defining the ""obvious"" map $\phi : (S^G)^{-1} A^G \to (S^{-1} A)^G$ via $\frac{a}{s} \mapsto \frac{a}{s}$ . In both cases, the issue I run into is that I need to show that any $\frac{a}{s} \in (S^{-1} A)^G$ , is equal to $\frac{a'}{s'}$ , where $a' \in A^G$ and $s' \in S^G$ .

For the numerator, if $A$ is an integral domain , then since $\frac{a}{s} \in (S^{-1} A)^G$ , we have that $\sigma(a)s - \sigma(s)a = 0$ . I can use this to show that the numerator is in $A^G$ by applying $\sigma$ to the numerator, and noting that if $\sigma \neq 1$ , then we get $s \sigma(a) \prod_{\tau \in G, \tau \neq \sigma,1} \tau(s) = a\prod_{\tau \in G, \tau \neq 1} \tau(s)$ , so the numerator is in $A^G$ . If $A$ is not an integral domain, then we get only that there exists $s_\sigma \in S$ such that $(\sigma(a) s - \sigma(s) a)s_\sigma = 0$ , and we have that $(\prod_{\sigma \in G} s_\sigma)(\prod_{\sigma \in G, \sigma \neq 1} \sigma(s))a \in A^G$ , but then we need to show that $(\prod_{\sigma \in G} s_\sigma) \in S^G$ .
