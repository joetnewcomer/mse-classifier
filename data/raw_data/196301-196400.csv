3782196,"Quadratic P.S.D. differential operator that is invariant under $\textrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$","Given some function $f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ , I'm interested in finding a positive semi-definite differential operator $\mathcal P: L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) \rightarrow L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ that is quadratic in $f$ and invariant under the the action of $\textrm{SL}{(2, \mathbb{R})},$ such that $\forall A \in \textrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and $\forall {\bf x} \in \mathbb{R}^2,$ $$ {\mathcal P} f(A {\bf x}) = [{\mathcal P} f] (A {\bf x} ).$$ After thinking for some time, I've come up with two operators that are invariant and P.S.D, but not quadratic. For example, suppose we consider the operator $${\mathcal P} = \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} - \left[\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x y}\right] \right)^2,$$ which is the squared determinant of the Hessian. It's clear that it is P.S.D. and invariant under transformations in $\textrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ , though it is quartic in $f$ . Furthermore, letting $H$ denote the Hessian and $J \in \textrm{SO}(2)$ be a rotation by $90^\circ$ , the operator $$ {\mathcal P} = \left(\nabla^T  J^T H  \ J \ \nabla\right)^2,$$ is also invariant and P.S.D., but is not quadratic. I'm asking this question in the hope that someone might know of such a quadratic P.S.D. differential operator that is invariant under $\textrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{R})$ (if it even exists) or be able to point me toward a with a few other ideas I could try.

3782213,How to choose the order of a Runge-Kutta method?,"I have seen that Runge-Kutta's methods are a family of methods used to approximate the solution of an initial value problem. I have also seen that they are classified depending on their order (with the second-order R-K being the Euler's Modified method, and the fourth-order R-K being the most used among them). So, given a first-order ODE $y'=f(x,y)$ with an initial condition $y(x_0)=y_0$ , what is the criteria to follow to choose the order of the Runge-Kutta method to be used?","['runge-kutta-methods', 'numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

3782304,A Sobolev space on a perforated domain with extension by a solid vector field,"Presentation : Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ an open bounded regular set and $B=B(a,r)$ a ball such as $\bar{B} \subset \Omega$ . I'm studying the following space : $$V=\{v|_{\Omega \setminus B} \in (H^1(\Omega \setminus B))^3 \ | \ \operatorname{div}(v) = 0 \text{ in } \Omega \setminus B \ | \ \gamma_0(v)=0 \text{ a.e on }  \partial \Omega \ | \ \exists (b,c) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3 \text{ such as } v|_{B}(x)=b + c \wedge (x-a) \}$$ where $\gamma_0 : (H^1(\Omega \setminus B))^3 \rightarrow (L^2(\partial \Omega \cup \partial B))^3$ is the sobolev trace application on $\Omega$ and the divergence condition should be understand in the distribution sense : $$\int\limits_{\Omega \setminus B} v \cdot \nabla \varphi=0, \ \forall \varphi \in C^\infty_c(\Omega \setminus B).$$ Concretely, the function $v \in V$ is a divergence free element in $(H^1(\Omega \setminus B))^3$ , which is worth $0$ on $\partial \Omega$ , that has been extended in the ball $B$ by a solid vector field $x \mapsto b + c \wedge (x-a)$ so as to get a function $v$ which is at least in $L^2(\Omega)$ . I want to study the property of this extension. My question I was wondering if it were possible to show that an element $v \in V$ is  in $(H^1_0(\Omega))^3$ and is divergence free in $\Omega$ . My attempt so far I want to show that the weak derivatives of $v$ are elements of $L^2(\Omega)$ . However, since I have a jump at the interface $\partial B$ , i'm not sure I will be able to have this kind of regularity. For the divergence free condition, I know that the divergence of a solid vector field $x \mapsto b + c \wedge (x-a)$ is $0$ pointwise, so the weak divergence is equal to $0$ both in $\Omega \setminus B$ and $B$ , but again I have an issue with the jump at $\partial B$ . Any help or references wich deal with such extension are welcomed, as always :).

The distance in both workouts was the same, but I'm not sure of the absolute value of it. I'm assuming the same walking speed for both workouts.
So I was wondering, is it possible to know how much faster was I running today in percentage or in absolute value?

3782320,Understanding the Lebesgue's Decomposition Theorem,"In his book Bauer proves the Lebesgue's decomposition theorem . Actually he proves it only in the case where $\mu$ and $\nu$ are finite, leaving the $\sigma$ -finite case as an exercise. Looking at the proof however I don't see anywhere where the finiteness of $\mu$ is used. For the $\sigma$ -finite case I did the following: Since $\nu$ is $\sigma$ -finite we can find a partition $(A_n)$ of $\Omega$ into sets of finite $\nu$ measure.  For each $n$ , let $\nu_n$ denote the finite measure defined by $\nu_n(A):=\nu(A\cap A_n)$ for measurable $A$ . From the finite measure case there is a unique decomposition $$\nu_n=\nu_n^c+\nu_n^s \hspace{0.7cm}\nu_n^c\ll\mu \hspace{0.7cm} \nu_n^s\perp\mu.$$ For each $n$ , let $N_n$ be such that $\mu(N_n)=0=\nu_n^s(N_n^c)$ and let $N=\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}N_n$ . Define the measures $\nu_c$ and $\nu_s$ by $\nu_c(A):=\nu(A\cap N^c)$ and $\nu_s(A):=\nu(A\cap N)$ for measurable $A$ . We see that $\nu=\nu_c+\nu_s$ and $\nu_s \perp\mu$ . Also $\nu_c\ll\mu $ , since $\mu(A)=0$ implies $$\nu_c(A)=\nu(A \cap N^c)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu_n(A\cap N^c)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu^c_n(A\cap N^c)+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu^s_n(A\cap N^c)$$ $$\leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu^c_n(A)+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu^s_n( N_n^c)=0$$ This shows existence as well as uniqueness, because if $\nu=\nu'_c+\nu'_s$ is any such decomposition, then defining the measures $\nu_n^{'c}(A):=\nu'_c(A\cap A_n)$ and $\nu_n^{'s}(A):=\nu'_s(A\cap A_n)$ for measurable $A$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we get $$\nu_n=\nu_n^c+\nu_n^s=\nu_n^{'c}+\nu_n^{'s} \hspace{0.7cm}\nu_n^{'c}\ll\mu \hspace{0.7cm} \nu_n^{'s}\perp\mu $$ which implies $\nu_n^c=\nu_n^{'c}$ and $\nu_n^s=\nu_n^{'s}$ for each $n$ by uniqueness. Hence $\nu'_c=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu_n^{'c}$ and $\nu'_s=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu_n^{'s}$ are completely determined. Again I don't see where the $\sigma$ -finiteness of $\mu$ is needed in the argument. I also get confused by the hint Bauer gives for the exercise: Hint. For the existence proof use 17.6 . For the uniqueness proof choose a sequence $(A_n)$ of measurable sets with $A_n \uparrow \Omega$ and $\mu(A_n),\nu(A_n)$ finite for each $n$ , and consider the measures $\nu_n(A):=\nu(A\cap A_n)$ for mesurable $A$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . EDIT: I think the requirement that $\mu$ be $\sigma$ -finite is due to the fact that Lebesgue's decomposition theorem is usually proven in conjunction with the Radon-Nikodym theorem. See my answer below. Still I don't get how to use the hint provided to prove existence and uniqueness. Any help is appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'radon-nikodym']"

3782394,"How is the function $\psi(c) = (c\bmod m,c\bmod n)$, given $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, a bijection?","I came across this lemma in a textbook, and found something in the proof I did not understand: Proof that $\psi$ is injective: Assume otherwise, that there exists a value in the co-domain that has more than one pre-image: $$\psi(c) = \psi(c')$$ By its definition, $\psi(c) = (c\mod m,c\mod n)$ , given $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ , so it follows: $$c \bmod m = c' \bmod\ m \iff c \equiv c' \pmod m$$ $$c \bmod n = c' \bmod\ n \iff c \equiv c' \pmod n$$ By definition of a congruence modulo x: $$c \equiv c' \pmod m \iff m\ |\ (c - c')$$ $$c \equiv c' \pmod n \iff n\ |\ (c - c')$$ Given that $m, n$ are relatively-prime ( $\gcd(m,n)=1$ ), it follows that: $$mn \mid(c - c')\iff c \equiv c' \pmod {mn}$$ Then, the text concludes that $c = c'$ from the above congruence, which I don't understand. Given that $c, c' \in \mathbb N$ , I don't see why $c - c'$ must equal $0$ . I even have a counterexample to this reasoning. If we take $m=2, n=3$ , which are relatively prime, we see that $\psi(7) = \psi(13) = \psi(6k + 1) = (1, 1)$ , showing that $(1,1)$ in the co-doman has multiple pre-images.

3782539,If the boundary of a manifold is $C^2$ then the distance to it is also $C^2$ in a neighborhood of the boundary.,"This question comes from the the local property of pseudoconvexity. Pseudoconvexity is is determined by the behaviour of the function of distance to the boundary. In fact it is determined by the differentially geometric property of the boundary in the view of Levi form . As in Demailly's note on complex analytic geometry , assume the boundary of an open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ has $C^2$ boundary. In order to generate Levi form we should make sure $\delta(z) = \mathrm{d}(x, \mathsf{C}\Omega)$ is also $C^2$ . But how can I make sure this is actually $C^2$ . One of my thought is using tubular neighbourhood. Locally the map $(x , t) \mapsto x+vt$ where $v$ is the unit normal vector is a diffeomorphism satisfying the nearing point on the boundary to $x+vt$ is $x$ . But if the boundary is $C^2$ , this map seems to be $C^1$ and so is the inverse $\pi$ of the map. And $\delta(z) = |\pi(z) - z|$ is also $C^1$ .","['complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

3782778,Prove that $\mathcal A$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\Bbb R^2.$,"Let $\textbf {x} = (x,y) \in \Bbb R^2.$ For any subset $E \subseteq \Bbb R^2$ define $\textbf {x} E$ as follows $:$ $$\textbf {x} E : = \left \{(ax,by)\ |\ (a,b) \in E \right \}.$$ Prove that $\mathcal A = \left \{E \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2}\ |\ \textbf {x} E \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2} \right \}$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra of subsets of $\Bbb R^2.$ It is easy to see that $\varnothing, \Bbb R^2 \in \mathcal A.$ Also $\mathcal A$ is closed under countable unions. For that let us take a sequence $\{E_n \}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ of elements in $\mathcal A.$ Need to show that $E = \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal A.$ For that we need only to show that $\textbf {x} E \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2}.$ Claim $:$ $\textbf {x} E = \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n.$ Let $y \in \textbf {x} E.$ Then $\exists$ $(a,b) \in E$ such that $y = (ax,by).$ Since $(a,b) \in E,$ $\exists$ $i \in \Bbb N$ such that $(a,b) \in E_i.$ But then $y = (ax,by) \in \textbf {x} E_i.$ Hence $y \in \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n.$ This shows that $\textbf {x} E \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n.\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)$ To prove the reverse inclusion let us take any $z \in \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n.$ Then $\exists$ $j \in \Bbb N$ such that $z \in \textbf {x} E_j.$ So $\exists$ $(p,q) \in E_j$ such that $z = \textbf {x} (p,q) = (px,qy).$ But since $E_j \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n = E,$ it follows that $(p,q) \in E.$ This shows that $z=(px,qy) = \textbf {x} (p,q) \in \textbf {x} E.$ Hence $\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n \subseteq \textbf {x} E.\ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ (2)$ From $(1)$ anf $(2)$ it follows that $\textbf {x} E = \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n.$ This proves the claim. Now since $E_n \in \mathcal A,$ for all $n \geq 1,$ it follows that $\textbf {x} E_n \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2},$ for all $n \geq 1.$ Since $\mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2}$ is a $\sigma$ -algebra of subsets of $\Bbb R^2,$ we have $\textbf {x} E = \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \textbf {x} E_n \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2}.$ This shows that $E = \bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n \in \mathcal A.$ Hence $\mathcal A$ is closed under countable unions. The last thing what we have to show is that $\mathcal A$ is closed under complimentation. For that let $E \in \mathcal A.$ Then $\textbf {x} E \in \mathcal L_{\Bbb R^2}.$ Now I'm trying to prove that $\left (\textbf {x} E \right )^c = \textbf {x} E^c.$ But I don't think it's true. For instance let $E = [0,1] \times [0,1]$ and $\textbf {x} = (1,0).$ Then $\textbf {x} E = \{(t,0)\ |\ t \in [0,1] \}.$ Now $\left (\frac  1 2,2 \right ) \in E^c.$ Therefore $\textbf {x} \left (\frac  1 2,2 \right ) = \left (\frac 1 2,0 \right ) \in \textbf {x} E^c.$ Therefore $\textbf {x} E^c \cap \textbf {x} E \neq \varnothing.$ Hence $\textbf {x} E^c \subsetneq \left (\textbf {x} E \right )^c.$ The equality can only occur if the both the components of $\textbf {x}$ are non-zero. So how do I prove that $\mathcal A$ is closed under complimentation in case both the components of $\textbf {x}$ are not simultaneously non-zero? Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.

3782864,"Derive a field from gradient expression that is linear in the field variable, $\textrm{grad}\,F \propto aF$","Not a mathematician.
I have got a problem of finding by integration a field $F$ from the expression of its gradient.
It is a physical problem in continuous space $x,y$ and time $t$ and with real-valued smooth functions. I first show the vanilla case I coped with; please do correct where applicable. The gradient relationship has the simple form $$
\textrm{grad} F =a \{\cos (\omega t), \sin(\omega t)\}  
$$ I consider the differential form for the spatial variation: $$
dF = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} dy
$$ Since the gradient components are independent of space, and of $F$ , in my case the formula above becomes the relationship $$
dF = a \cos(\omega t)\, dx + a \sin(\omega t)\,dy
$$ I integrate both sides along an arbitrary line on the plane $(x,y)$ and the result is $$
F -F_0 = a \cos(\omega t)\, (x-x_0) + a \sin(\omega t)\,(y-y_0)
$$ where $F_0 = F(x_0,y_0)$ , which I can set. The surface of $F$ is a rotating plane. The case that I found difficult is when the gradient depends on $F$ , say as simply as this form $$
\textrm{grad} F =aF \{\cos (\omega t), \sin(\omega t)\}  
$$ The same differential form as above becomes $$
dF = aF \cos(\omega t)\, dx + aF \sin(\omega t)\,dy

3782930,regular Borel probability measure implying countable basis,"Peter Walters' An Introduction to Ergodic Theory (page 10) says If $X$ is a metric space and ( $\mathscr{B}$ is the $\sigma$ -algebra of Borel subsets of $X$ ... and $m$ is any probability measure on $(X, \mathscr{B})$ then $(X, \mathscr{B},m)$ has a countable basis. (This follows from Theorem 6.1.) Therefore most of the spaces we shall deal with have $L^2(X, \mathscr{B}, m)$ separable. I do not see why $(X, \mathscr{B},m)$ has a countable basis. Here, $(X, \mathscr{B},m)$ is said to have a countable basis if there exists a sequence of elements $\{E_n\}_n^\infty\subset \mathscr{B}$ such that for every $\epsilon>0$ and every $B\in\mathscr{B}$ with $m(B)<\infty$ there is some $n$ with $$

3782955,Continuity of retraction on $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$,"I'm reading Milnor's Morse Theory and I have difficulty verifying some claim (which is easy according to Milnor) on page $88$ ,  section $\S 16$ in the book. Here's the setup for my question. In the end, I only ask about how to show that a certain map between metric spaces is continuous. Let $\Omega= \Omega(M;p,q)$ be the set of piecewise smooth path $\omega : [0,1]\to M$ from $p$ to $q$ in the connected, complete Riemannian manifold $M$ . This set equipped with metric function $d : \Omega \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $$
d(\omega,\omega') = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega(t), \omega'(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\omega}(t)\| - \|\dot{\omega}'(t)\| \Big)^2 dt },
$$ where $\rho : M \times M \to \mathbb{R}$ is the topological metric of $M$ coming from its Riemannian metric. I already showed that the Energy function $E : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ , $E(\omega) = \int_0^1 \|\dot{\omega}\|^2 dt $ is continuous. So for some $c>0$ we have open subset $\text{Int }\Omega^c :=  E^{-1}([0,c))$ . For a subdivision $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_k=1$ ,  let $\Omega(t_0,\dots,t_k)$ be a subspace of $\Omega$ consisting of paths $\omega : [0,1] \to M$ such that segment $\omega|[t_{i-1},t_i]$ is a geodesic for each $i=1,\dots,k$ . Finally we have subspace $$
B := \text{Int }\Omega^c \, \cap \, \Omega(t_0,\dots,t_k). 
$$ It is shown in the text that we can define a map $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$ such that each piecewise-smooth curve $\omega \in \text{Int }\Omega^c = E^{-1}([0,c))$ maped to unique broken geodesic $r(\omega) \in B$ formed by joining the end points $\omega(t_{i-1})$ to $\omega(t_i)$ by minimal geodesic. The detail as follows : for each $i=1,\dots,k$ , the couple $\omega(t_{i-1}),\omega(t_i)$ contained in a neighbourhood $W_i$ of a point $x_i \in M$ such that $W_i \times W_i \subset F(U' \times B_{\delta}(0))$ , where $F : U' \times B_{\delta}(0) \to M \times M$ is the map $F(x,v)=(x,\text{exp}_x(v))$ which map $U'\times B_{\delta}(0)$ diffeomorphic onto its image. Therefore the couple $\omega(t_{i-1}),\omega(t_i)$ contained in the image $F(U'\times B_{\delta}(0))$ which means that there is a unique minimal geodesic from $\omega(t_{i-1})$ to $\omega(t_i)$ . Therefore broken geodesic $r(\omega)$ uniquely determined. $\color{blue}{(\star)}$ Question : How to show that the map $r : \text{Int }\Omega^c \to B$ is continuous? I decided to show this by sequence criteria for continuous function. That is if $\omega_n \to \omega$ as $n \to \infty$ then $\gamma_n=r(\omega_n) \to \gamma=r(\omega)$ as $n \to \infty$ . Here is my thought so far: The sequence $\omega_n \to \omega$ says that I can make the distance $$
d(\omega_n,\omega) = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega_n(t), \omega(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\omega}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\omega}(t)\| \Big)^2 dt }, \qquad (1)
$$ as small  as i like by letting $n$ large enough. Let $\epsilon>0$ be the challenge, i have to show that for $n$ large enough, the distance $$
d(\gamma_n,\gamma) = \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \gamma_n(t), \gamma(t)\big) + \sqrt{\int_0^1 \Big( \|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| \Big)^2 dt }, \qquad (2)
$$ will be small than $\epsilon$ . I think I can show that $ \max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \gamma_n(t), \gamma(t)\big) $ can be made small as I like since I can control the term $\max_{t \in [0,1] } \rho\big( \omega_n(t), \omega(t)\big)$ . My problem is to control the integral term in $(2)$ . I know that the $\gamma$ 's are broken geodesics, so on each segement $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ , the integrand $\Big( \|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| - \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| \Big)^2$ on the integral term in $(2)$ , is constant. So if i can show that on each segment that $\|\dot{\gamma}_n(t)\| \to \|\dot{\gamma}(t)\| $ as $n \to \infty$ for some fix $t \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$ , then the whole integral goes to zero. To show this, i plan to use the continuity of exponential map $(q,v) \to \text{exp}(p,v)$ that define each geodesic segment $\gamma_n$ and $\gamma$ . Am I on the right track ? Any help will be appreciated. Thank you. Update Here is the detail of my idea in the paragraph above this: lets concentrate on a particular segment $[t_{i-1},t_i]$ . Since i already showed that $\max_{t \in [0,1]} \rho\big( \gamma_n(t),\gamma(t) \big) \to 0$ we have $$
\rho\big( \gamma_n(t_{i-1}),\gamma(t_{i-1}) \big) \to 0, \quad \text{and} \quad \rho\big( \gamma_n(t_{i}),\gamma(t_{i}) \big) \to 0.
$$ Therefore if $W_i$ is the neighbourhood of a point $x_i \in M$ such that $\omega(t_{i-1}) = \gamma(t_{i-1})$ and $\omega(t_i) = \gamma(t_i)$ both contained in $W_i$ (as described in $\color{blue}{(\star)}$ above), then for $n$ large enough the end points $\gamma_n(t_{i-1})$ and $\gamma_n(t_i)$ also contained in $W_i$ . Since $W_i \times W_i \subset F(U'\times B_{\delta}(0))$ with $F(x,v):=(x,\text{exp}_x(v))$ and $F$ diffeomorphic to its image, then $$
F(\gamma_n(t_{i-1}),v_n) = (\gamma_n(t_{i-1}), \gamma_n(t_i)), \quad \text{and} \quad F(\gamma(t_{i-1}),v) = (\gamma(t_{i-1}), \gamma(t_i))
$$ for some tangent vectors $v_n$ and $v $ at the starting points. But since the curves $\text{exp}_{\gamma(t_{i-1})}(tv_n)$ with domain $[0,1]$ is just reparametrization of geodesic segment $\gamma_n|[t_{i-1},t_i]$ , then the initial velocities related by a constant as $v_n = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}_n\|$ . Similarly for $\gamma$ we have $ v = \lambda \| \dot{\gamma} \|$ . Since $F$ diffeomorphism (onto its image) we can write $$
(\gamma_n(t_{i-1}),v_n) = F^{-1}(\gamma_n(t_{i-1}), \gamma_n(t_i)), \quad \text{and} \quad (\gamma(t_{i-1}),v) = F^{-1}(\gamma(t_{i-1}), \gamma(t_i)).
$$ Now by continuity of $F^{-1}$ , the convergence $\gamma_n(t_{i-1}) \to \gamma(t_{i-1})$ and $\gamma_n(t_i) \to \gamma(t_i)$ implies $v_n = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}_n\| \to v = \lambda  \|\dot{\gamma}\| $ . Therefore $\|\dot{\gamma}_n\| \to \|\dot{\gamma}\|$ .","['riemannian-geometry', 'morse-theory', 'continuity', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

For example consider the two-dimensional irreducible representation $V$ of the quarternion group $Q_8$ , then the ring of invariants is finitely generated by Hilbert's finiteness theorem, but  the algebra of invariants, which is a subalgebra of a polynomial algebra in two variables holds the form $$ \mathbb{C}[V]^{Q_8} = \dfrac{\mathbb{C}[f,g,h]}{(h^2-f^2g+4g^3)},$$ where $f$ and $g$ are invariant polynomials of degree 4, and $h$ is of degree 6. The reason is that the generating polynomials are not algebraically independent. Now consider a commutative ring $R$ , and $M$ a finitely generating $R$ -module, and $\{m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n\}$ a generating set for $M$ , I want to know whether it is true that $M$ holds the form $$ M = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n Rm_i$$ I think this is not true, but this is true if and only if $M$ is a finitely generated $\textit{free}$ module over $R$ .

I want to show with rigor that the process $(S_{\tau + n}- S_\tau)_{n \geq 1}$ is a Markov chain (satisfies the Markov property). For convenience, let us write $\tilde{S}_n = S_{\tau + n} - S_\tau$ . As $\tilde{S}_n$ is independent of $\tau$ and $S_\tau$ it makes absolutely sense that the process is Markov but I would like to see the argument in more detail.

Let us in addition to (1) assume that $$ (X_1, X_2, \dots) \overset{d}{=} (X_{\tau + 1}, X_{\tau +2}, \dots).$$ Maybe this is now enough to prove the claim that $\tilde{S}_n$ is a Markov chain. Edit2: I am starting to think that the assumptions are not necessary. Simply by the structure of $S$ and in view of $\tilde{S}_n = X_{\tau + 1 } + \dots + X_{\tau + n}$ we have should have that $\tilde{S}_n$ conditioned on the values of $\tilde{S}_1, \dots , \tilde{S}_{n-1}$ only depends on $\tilde{S}_{n-1}$ .

3783141,Functoriality of the module of Kähler differentials,"In Eisenbud's Commutative Algebra , at the start of Chapter 16, he describes the module of Kähler differentials: given a ring $R$ and an $R$ -algebra $S$ , we have the associated $S$ -module $\Omega_{S/R}$ . This comes equipped with an $R$ -module homomorphism $d: S \to \Omega_{S/R}$ , called the universal $R$ -linear derivation , which satisfies an associated universal property. He goes on to state that the module of Kähler differentials is functorial in the following sense: given a commutative diagram of rings $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
R @>>> R'\\
@V{}VV @VVV\\
S @>>> S',
\end{CD} where $S$ is an $R$ -algebra, and $S'$ is an $R'$ -algebra, there is a commutative square of abelian groups $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}

As Eisenbud notes, this is quite complicated to state. I am curious if this can be rephrased in a simpler way. My question can be stated concisely as follows: As the module of Kähler differentials is functorial, we should be able to understand it as a functor of the form $\Omega_{-/-}: \mathscr{C} \to \mathscr{D}$ . In this context, what are the categories $\mathscr{C}$ and $\mathscr{D}$ ?

3783199,Structure of the Mapping Cylinder of a Continuous Function,"Let $X,Y$ be topological spaces and $f : X \to Y$ a continuous function. In his book Algebraic Topology , Hatcher constructs the mapping cylinder of $f$ to be the quotient space $M_f = ((X \times I) \sqcup Y)/\sim$ , where $(x,1) \sim f(x)$ for all $x \in X$ . I'm trying to prove the intuitively obvious claim that $\pi|_Y : Y \to \pi(Y)$ is a homeomorphism, where $\pi : (X \times I) \sqcup Y \to M_f$ is the quotient map. Here are my thoughts: Clearly the map is continuous and a bijection onto its image, so we just need to show that it's open. For any $U \subset Y$ open, we know that $f^{-1}(U) \subset X$ is open since $f$ is continuous. Then $f^{-1}(U) \times I$ is open in $X \times I$ which implies that $V := (f^{-1}(U) \times I) \cup U$ is open in $(X\times I) \sqcup Y$ . $V$ is also saturated with respect to the quotient map $\pi$ , so $\pi(V)$ is open in $M_f$ . It follows that $\pi(V) \cap \pi(Y)$ is open in $\pi(Y)$ , but it's easy to see that $\pi(V) \cap \pi(Y)$ is just $\pi(U)$ , and the proof is complete. I'm pretty sure this reasoning is correct (let me know if it isn't), but I'm trying to figure out if the continuity of $f$ is necessary for the claim to hold. My gut tells me that it shouldn't---even if $X \times I$ is joined to $Y$ by some crazy, discontinuous function, the gluing should still leave $Y$ intact. Is there a way to prove this without relying on the continuity of $f$ , or is the claim even true in this case?","['continuity', 'general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

3783255,Let $\alpha>0$. Show that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\sin nx\over n^\alpha}$ converges for all $x\in\Bbb{R}$ and examine continuity of the limit function.,"First of all I have proved that this series of functions $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty {\sin nx\over n^\alpha}$$ converges $\forall x\in\Bbb{R}$ .
Let $f_n(x)=\sin nx$ and $g_n(x)=\frac{1}{n^\alpha}$ .
Let us fix $x\in\Bbb{R}$ .
Now, let $a_n=f_n(x)$ and $b_n=g_n(x)$ . Now if $x=2m\pi$ for some $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ , $a_n=0$ , hence the series $\sum a_nb_n$ converges to $0$ . Now we assume $x\ne2m\pi$ for any $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ .
Then the partial sums of $(a_n)$ to be $A_n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k$ . Then $$ \left| A_n \right| = \left| \sin x + \sin 2x + \cdots + \sin nx \right| = \left|\frac{\sin{\frac{nx}{2}}\sin {\frac{(n+1)x}{2}}}{\sin{\frac{x}{2}}}\right| \le \frac{1}{\left|\sin{\frac{x}{2}}\right|} $$ and $\frac{1}{\left|\sin{\frac{x}{2}}\right|} \in \Bbb{R}$ since $x \ne 2m\pi$ .
So, partial sums of $(a_n)$ are bounded. Again $b_n={1\over n^\alpha}$ is monotone decreasing and converges to $0$ .
Hence by Dirichlet's test the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nb_n$ converges. Thus the series of functions $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha}$ converges for all $x\in\Bbb{R}$ . Let $$ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha} $$ My target is to find where the function $f$ is continuous. Let us choose a point $a\in\Bbb{R}$ such that $a\ne2m\pi$ for any $m\in\Bbb{Z}$ .
Now we can always find a compact interval $I$ containing $a$ such that $\sin \frac{x}{2} \ne 0$ $\forall x\in I$ since we have chosen $a\ne2m\pi$ . Since, $I$ is compact interval and $\sin$ function is continuous we have $\min_{x\in I}\lvert \sin \frac{x}{2} \rvert = m > 0 $ . We will show that the series of functions $\sum f_n g_n$ converges uniformly on $I$ by using Dirichlet's test for the series of functions.
Let $(F_n)$ denotes the sequence of partial sums of $(f_n)$ .
Then for all $x\in I$ , $\left|F_n(x)\right|\le \frac{1}{\lvert\sin\frac{x}{2}\rvert}\le\frac{1}{m}$ , hence the sequence of functions $(F_n)$ is uniformly bounded over $I$ .
Again, the sequence of function $g_n(x)={1\over n^\alpha}$ is monotone decreasing and converging uniformly to $0$ function.
Thus by Dirichlet's Test for series of functions the series of functions $\sum f_n(x)g_n(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sin nx}{n^\alpha}$ converges uniformly over $I$ .
Since the functions $f_n g_n$ are continuous on $I$ , the limit function $f$ is continuous on $I$ .
In particular since $a\in I$ , $f$ is continuous at $a$ . So I found $f$ is continuous on the set $\Bbb{R}\setminus \{2m\pi \mid m\in\Bbb{Z}\}$ . But what about the points like $2m\pi$ ? I observed that $f$ is $0$ at those points.
I am getting no idea how to check continuity at those points. Can anyone help me in this regard? Thanks for your help in advance.","['sequence-of-function', 'continuity', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

3783337,"Prove that if a finite simple graph $G$ has exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components, then $G$ is a forest","Problem If a finite simple graph $G$ has exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components, then $G$ is a forest. Prove this by induction on the number of vertices. Solution I reached a solution to this problem; however, I wasn't able to reach a conclusion using induction. First, I'm going to show the solution without using induction. Then, I will show the beginning of a solution that attempts to use induction, but in which I got stuck. Without using induction In this solution, I'm going to use, without proof, the following theorem about finite forests, found on the textbook I'm using: Theorem . A finite forest $F$ cosists of exactly $|V(F)| - |E(F)|$ trees. Let $G$ be any finite simple graph with $n$ vertices and exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components. Then, there is a set $E \subseteq E(G)$ of edges on cycles of $G$ such that removing these edges from $G$ leaves an acyclic graph $H = G - E$ . By definition, $H$ is a forest. Then, by the above Theorem, it has $|V(H)| - |E(H)|$ connected components. Removing edges on cycles from $G$ doesn't change the number of connected components, because, for each edge $e$ that was removed from $G$ , there is a path between the endpoints of $e$ that doesn't include $e$ . So, $G$ and $H$ have the same number of connected components: $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(H)| - |E(H)|$$ Since $V(H) = V(G)$ and $E(H) = E(G) - |E|$ , substituting these values in the above expression yields: $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(G)| - (|E(G)| - |E|)$$ $$|V(G)| - |E(G)| = |V(G)| - |E(G)| + |E|$$ $$|E| = 0$$ So, $G$ had no cycles to begin with. Therefore, $G$ is a forest. Using induction Induction hypothesis : $P(n)$ := if a finite simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has exactly $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components, then $G$ is a forest. Base case ( $n = 1$ ): A graph with only 1 vertex has $|V(G)| - |E(G)| = 1$ component, and it's a forest. So, $P(1)$ is true. Inductive step ( $n \geq 1$ ): Let $G$ be a graph with $n + 1$ vertices and $|V(G)| - |E(G)|$ components. Let $v$ be a $k$ -degree vertex of $G$ . Remove $v$ and all its $k$ incident edges, leaving a subgraph $H$ with $|V(G)| - 1$ vertices and $|E(G)| - k$ edges. I got stuck at this point.

Can we do this without using complex integration? I know the proof of the fact that there exists no function whose exponential is the identity function $id(z) = z$ on the complex plane which uses complex analysis. We proceed by assuming such a  holomorphic $h(z)$ exists. This means that $e^{h(z)} = z$ . Differentiating, we get $1 = e^{h(z)} h'(z) = z h'(z)$ . This means that $1 = z h'(z)$ , or $h'(z) = 1/z$ . Now we compute $\oint h'(z)$ around the countour $c(t) = e^{2 \pi i t}$ in two different ways: $\oint h'(z) = h(1) - h(1) = 0$ , by using FTC and that the countor starts and ends at the same point: $1$ . $\oint h'(z) = \oint 1/z = 2 \pi i$ by the Residue Theorem Thus, we get $0 = 2 \pi i$ which is absurd.

The reason for this is because $A^H A$ and $B^H B$ are related the following way ( $A^H$ is the Hermitian transpose of $A$ ): $$B^H B = (U_1 A U_2)^H (U_1 A U_2) = U_2^H A^H U_1^H U_1 A U_2 = U_2^H A^H A U_2 = U_2^{-1} (A^H A) U_2$$ Since $A^H A$ and $B^H B$ are similar matrices (by definition), they share the same eigenvalues. Since the singular values of any matrix $M$ are the positive square-roots of the eigenvalues of $M^T M$ , $A$ and $B$ have the same singular values. Is there a special name relating these types of matrices (just like ""similar matrix"" relates $A$ and $B$ with the same eigenvalues)? I know that orthogonally equivalent matrices $C$ and $D = U C U^H$ are kind of similar to this, but $C$ and $D$ are always square, and the two unitary matrices are related as the inverse of one another ( $U^H = U^{-1}$ ). In my problem statement, $A$ and $B$ can be rectangular, and the 2 unitary matrices $U_1$ and $U_2$ don't have to be related to each other (in fact, even their dimensions may differ).","['matrices', 'singular-values', 'linear-algebra', 'terminology']"
3783546,Is the set of all random $n$-vectors with arbitrary expectations an inner product space?,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal A, Prob)$ be a probability space. Let $V$ be a set of all random $n$ -vectors $X$ of the form $X = [x_1 \cdots x_n]^T$ , where each $x_i: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is in turn an arbitrary random variable with finite second moment, i.e., $e\left[X^T X\right] < \infty$ . Is $V$ a real inner product space without requiring that expectation $E[X] = 0$ for each element $X$ of $V$ ? If yes, what is the simplest inner product definition that does the job? (Note: $E$ is the expectation operator on $V$ whereas $e$ is the expectation operator on the vector space of all random variables $x: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R$ .) It is clear to me that $V$ satisfies the axioms of a real vector space. I can also see that if $V$ were to consist of only those random $n$ -vectors $X$ that have zero expectation, then the inner product definition $\langle X, Y \rangle = e\left[X^TY\right]$ transforms $V$ into a real inner product space. However I am unsure about the general case of $V$ as mentioned in the question. Would appreciate some insight, and a simple example of an inner product definition, if the answer to the question is ""yes"".

3783577,Chernoff bound for binary cross entropy loss with finite bracketing entropy,"Consider the binary cross entropy loss of the posterior $\eta(x) = \mathbb{P}(Y=1 | X=x)$ : $$\mathcal{L}_n(\eta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i\log(\eta(X_i)) + (1-Y_i)\log(1-\eta(X_i))$$ Assume that $\eta$ has finite bracketing entropy. Specifically, assume that for every $\eta$ there exists $\eta_L \leq \eta \leq \eta_U$ with $\eta_L, \eta_U \in \mathcal{F_\delta}$ where $\mathcal{F_\delta}$ is a finite class of functions and $\eta_L, \eta_U$ are close in the sense that: $\mathbb{E}|\eta_L- \eta_U| \leq \delta$ . Show the following upper bound on the deviation of the empirical likelihood from the expectation for all $\varepsilon < \varepsilon_0$ where $\varepsilon_0$ is some positive constant that may depend on the $\eta$ being considered: $$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_n] > \varepsilon) \leq e^{-n\varepsilon^2/16}$$ I expect I should be able to apply a Chernoff bound here but I am having trouble evaluating or bounding the moment generating function of $\mathcal{L}_n$ : $$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_n] > \varepsilon) \leq \inf_t \frac{\mathbb{E}\exp{t\mathcal{L}_n}}{\exp{t\epsilon}}$$ In this case I don't know anything about $\eta$ other than it's range. In particular, $\eta(x)$ can be $0$ for some values of $x$ , in which case $\log(\eta(x))$ is unbounded. How do I deal with this? If it's not possible to show such a bound, what additional assumptions do I need to make so that such a bound is possible? EDIT: I've tried to apply a symmetrization argument, but I am still missing a bound on the deviation of each term in the summation. As described in the question, we will use a chernoff bound: $$\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_n] > \varepsilon) \leq \inf_t \frac{\mathbb{E}\exp{t(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_n])}}{\exp{t\epsilon}}$$ Let's focus on the numerator. By Jensen's: $$\mathbb{E}\exp{t(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_n])} \leq \mathbb{E}\exp{t(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathcal{L}_n')}$$ where $\mathcal{L}_n'$ is an independent sample that is identically distributed to $\mathcal{L}_n$ . Now, since $\mathcal{L}_n - \mathcal{L}_n'$ is distributed as $\sigma(\mathcal{L}_n - \mathcal{L}_n')$ where $\sigma$ is a rademacher random variable we can take the expectation conditonal on $\sigma$ and apply the fact that $\sigma$ is subgaussian: $$\leq \Pi_i \mathbb{E}\exp{(t/n)^2(Z_i - Z_i')^2/8}$$ where $Z_i, Z_i'$ are individual terms in the summation forming $\mathcal{L}_n, \mathcal{L}_n'$ respectively. All that remains to do is to upperbound $(Z_i - Z_i')$ and then optimize $t$ to get the upper bound. However, it's not clear to me that I can bound this difference. EDIT 2: It should also be possible to apply Theorem 2 from https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/01/03/254a-notes-1-concentration-of-measure/ by showing that each term in the likelihood has bounded variance. EDIT 3: I'm pretty sure we need additional conditions on the class of bracketing functions (either bounded second moment or bounded a.s.) but I am not sure how to show that those conditions are required. For example, for the weak law of large numbers we use the condition of finite variance and arrive at a similar subgaussian convergence rate (we could also arrive at the same rate with absolute integrability condition by applying the truncation method). Although in this case, the convergence is subexponential since we only need to specify some $\epsilon_0$ where the condition holds. This question is from problem 15.4 in [1].

Clearly, the conjecture is true if any of $d_1, \dots, d_k$ are prime powers. If none of them are prime powers, then they must be among $6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, \dots$ Since $S = \frac{1}{6}+ \frac{1}{10}+ \frac{1}{12}+ \frac{1}{14}+ \frac{1}{15}+ \frac{1}{16}+ \frac{1}{18}+ \frac{1}{20}+ \frac{1}{21} + \frac{1}{22}+\frac{1}{24}+\frac{1}{26}+\frac{1}{28}+\frac{1}{30}+\frac{1}{33}+\frac{1}{34}+\frac{1}{35} < 1 < S + \frac{1}{36},$ any counterexample must have $k \ge 18.$ But including a number with $2$ distinct prime divisiors severely restricts the numbers we are allowed to take afterwards, so we could perform further casework and make the bound for a potential counterexample higher and higher. Warning: You cannot rely solely on analysis because if $=1$ is replaced with $\ge 1,$ the result is false. There are $2$ constructions that demonstrate this: $\{6, 10, 15\} \cup \{30a : a \le n\}$ for $n$ large enough. $\{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 210\} \cup S'$ where $S'$ is a finite subset of $S = \{2^a 3^b 5^c : \text{at most one of } a, b, c \text{ is zero}\}$ with sum $\ge 209/210.$ This is possible since $\sum\limits_{s \in S} \frac{1}{s} = 1.$","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'egyptian-fractions']"

3784109,Ratio of the sum of the four circles to the area of the original right triangle,"A right triangle is divided into two smaller right triangles by the altitude $CD$ to its hypotenuse $AB$ as shown in the diagram. Circle $O$ with radius $r$ is inscribed in the $\unicode {0x25FA} BCD$ . The $\unicode {0x25FA} CAD$ contains 3 circles which are tangent to each other and also to the sides of the triangle as depicted in the diagram. All four circles are congruent . What is the ratio of the sum of the areas of the four circles to the area of the original $\unicode {0x25FA} ABC$ ? My solution: Say, $BC = a, CA = b, AB = c$ . As $\unicode {0x25FA} BCD \sim \unicode {0x25FA} CAD$ , it is easy to see that $\angle OBC = \angle ACE$ and $\angle OCB = \angle CAG$ . Given that the circles are congruent, $BH = CI, CH = AJ, IJ = 4r$ . So we get, $b-a = 4r$ . Given $\unicode {0x25FA} BCD \sim \unicode {0x25FA} ABC$ , the ratio of their inradius will be the ratio of their hypotenuse (or other sides). So, $r \times c = a \times \dfrac{a+b-c}{2}$ or $c(b-a) = 2a(a+b-c)$ or $(a+b)(2a-c) = 0$ . So, $c = 2a$ and hence $\angle A = 30^0, \angle B = 60^0$ . $BC = 2BD = 2r(1+cot30^0) = 2r(\sqrt3+1)$ $AC = BC+4r = 2r(3+\sqrt3)$ Area of $\unicode {0x25FA} ABC = \dfrac{1}{2} \times AC \times BC = 4r^2(2\sqrt3 + 3)$ So, the ratio of the sum of the areas of 4 circles to the triangle ABC $= \dfrac{4 \pi r^2}{4r^2(2\sqrt3+3)} = \dfrac{\pi}{3} (2\sqrt3-3)$ Coming to the purpose of posting the question here - With the arrangement of the congruent circles and division of the triangle $ABC$ , we come to the conclusion that $c = 2a$ .

3784368,Problems with Set Function,"(Questions are at the bottom of the post. I’ve added two more doubts since the recent answer.) Introduction Consider $f:A\to\mathbb{R}$ where $A\subseteq[a,b]$ , $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $S$ is a fixed subset of $A$ . Before mentioning my set function, it is important to know I need it to compute my average. The average should satisfy the following Positivity: If $f>0$ , $\operatorname{average}(A,f)>0$ . Linearity: $\operatorname{average}(A,f+g)=\operatorname{average}(A,f)+\operatorname{average}(A,g)$ , and $\operatorname{average}(A,cf(x))$ is $c \times\text{average}(A,f(x))$ . As $f\to\text{constant function}$ , $\operatorname{average}(A,f)\to\text{constant}$ The $\operatorname{average}{(A,f)}$ should give a defined, unique value when $f$ is defined on a measurable set. Take for example functions defined on Lebesgue measurable sets. The average of $f$ should satisfy $\inf f \le \operatorname{average} (A,f) \le \sup f$ when $f$ is defined on measurable sets. The Average defined by the Lebesgue Measure and Integral does not fit all the requirements. If $\lambda(A)$ is the Lebesgue Measure of $A$ and $\lambda(A)=0$ , then the average of $f$ is undefined breaking rules 4 and 5. I wish to define an average that matches all the rules and gives the following. When $\lambda(A)>0$ , the average should be the Lebesgue Average. When $A$ is finite the average of $f$ should be $$\frac{1}{|A|}\sum_{x\in A}f(x)$$ When $A$ is infinite and $\lambda(A)=0$ , divide $[a,b]$ into $r$ equal sub-intervals. Take the average of $f$ over the infimum of all sub-intervals that meet $A$ . Call this the lower average. Take the average of $f$ over the supremum of all sub-intervals that meet $A$ . Call this the upper average. As $r\to\infty$ , if the lower and upper average meet at the same value, call this the total average. When the total average is defined it should equal the average I want to define. There are cases of $f$ where neither of these averages can give a defined value. Rather we generalize these definitions into my average and see that supports rules 4. and 5. The problem may not be well-defined since an average may be unable to exist on all zero Lebesgue Measure sets. However, before working on my average, I would like to work on my set function which I shall use to compute my average. Note the set function I am defining may not be a measure. It could be finitely additive but give positive values for sets with zero Lebesgue measure. Definition of Outer Set Function $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ If we define the following: $I=[a,b]$ $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ $\left(I_k\right)_{k=1}^{m}$ are $m$ open sub-intervals of $I$ $\ell(I)=b-a$ is the length of $I$ $\ell(I_k)=c\in\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is the length of $I_k$ for $k=1,...,m$ $$\Omega(S\cap I_k)=\begin{cases} 
0 & S\cap I_k \ \text{is countable}\\
1 & S\cap I_k \ \text{is uncountable} \\ 
\end{cases}$$ then $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ is the outer piece-wise set function defined as \begin{align*}
& \mu^{*}(c,S)=  \begin{cases}\inf\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{m}c\ \Omega\left(S\cap I_{k}\right): S\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{m}I_{k}\right\} & A \ \text{is uncountable}\\
\inf\limits_{m\in\mathbb{N}}\left\{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{m}c : S\subseteq\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{m}I_{k} \right\} & A \ \text{is countable}\\
\end{cases}
\end{align*} Explanation of $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ (Skip if you understand my definition) The parameter $c$ must remain a variable throughout the computation of $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ . When $A$ is uncountable, $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ should equal $cm^{\prime}_{\text{min}}$ , where $m^{\prime}_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum number of $I_k$ that cover $S$ for $k$ where $S\cap I_k$ is uncountable. The reason we set some $I_k$ to lengths zero is that countable subsets of $A$ , such as countable $S\cap I_k$ , are regarded to be as small as the null set compared to the uncountable set. Hence we ""prevent"" corresponding $I_k$ from covering this part of $S$ by setting their ""lengths"" to zero instead of $c$ . When $A$ is countable $\mu^{*}(c,S)$ should equal $cm_{\text{min}}$ where $m_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum number of $I_k$ that can cover $S$ . Here $S\cap I_k$ can be countable (instead of uncountable). When $A$ is countable, we do not set the length of any $I_k$ to be zero, since countable subsets of countable $A$ , should be covered by $I_k$ such that the total length of $I_k$ should have a positive proportional value to $\mu^{*}(c,A)$ . Inner Set Function $\mu_{*}(c,S)$ and Total Set Function $\mu(c,S)$ where $\mu(c,S)=\mu^{*}(c,S)=\mu_{*}(c,S)$ The inner set function should be $$\mu_{*}(c,S)=\mu^{*}(c,A)-\mu^{*}(c,A\setminus S)$$ Making the total set function $\mu(c,S)$ defined for values of $c$ where, $$\mu(c,S)=\mu^{*}(c,S)=\mu_{*}(c,S)$$ I added this so the total set function would be as rigorous as the Lebesgue Measure. I'm not sure whether this is necessary. The problem is for most values of $c$ , $\mu^{*}(c,S)\neq \mu_{*}(c,S)$ , so to fix this I set the limit as $c\to 0$ . $$\lim_{c\to 0}\mu(c,S)=\lim_{c\to 0}\mu^{*}(c,S)=\lim_{c\to 0}\mu_{*}(c,S)$$ Questions What is $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,\mathbb{Q})$ , $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))$ , and $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,\mathbb{Q}\cup\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))$ , where $A=\mathbb{Q}\cup\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0})$ ? My guess is all the answers would be $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}c\left\lceil\frac{b-a}{c}\right\rceil$ since they are countable and dense in $[a,b]$ . If I am correct, here is the problem... If my set function is finitely additive: $$\lim_{c\to 0}\mu(c,\mathbb{Q}\cup\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))=\lim_{c\to 0}\left(\mu(c,\mathbb{Q})+\mu(c,\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))\right)=2(b-a)$$ However, $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,\mathbb{Q}\cup\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))=\lim\limits_{c\to 0}c\left\lceil\frac{b-a}{c}\right\rceil=b-a$ The finite additivity on my set function doesn't give this, hence either my calculations are wrong or my set function is not finitely additive. Which is true? What should be $\mu^{*}(c,\mathbb{Q})$ and $\mu^{*}(c,\ln(\mathbb{Q}_{>0}))$ instead? Edit: According to a recent answer, the set function is not well-defined for this specific case. Here are a few more things I need resolved. When $A=[a,b]$ , does my set function of $S$ equal the Lebesgue measure of $S$ . If $A=\mathbb{Q}$ could we solve $\lim_{c\to 0} \mu(c,S)$ by doing the following: Take elements of $S$ that have $n$ decimal places. Take $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu$ of these elements as $n\to\infty$ . If we cannot do this, how can we change my definition of $\lim\limits_{c\to 0}\mu(c,S)$ so this is possible.","['amenability', 'measure-theory', 'outer-measure', 'means', 'average']"
3784420,Are partitions of unity needed in manifolds to define a measure coinciding with the Lebesgue measure under coordinate systems?,"Consider a Hausdorff smooth manifold $M^n$ . In the book Riemannian Geometry by Gallot, Hulin and Lafontaine, proposition 6.1.4 reads as follows: If $M$ is compact (or locally compact and countable at infinity), there always exists a density. (...) In such context, I understand that the idea for defining a density would be: let $\{\rho_i\}$ be a partition of unity strictly subordinate to a smooth atlas $\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}$ . Given a local chart $(U_i,\phi_i)$ and a Lebesgue measurable $E \subset \phi_i(U_i)$ , define $\mu_i(E)=\sum_j \int_{\phi_i(U_i \cap U_j)} \rho_j \chi_E dm=m(E)$ , where m is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ . I understand that such definition allows us to prove the second axiom of densities. (i.e., the Change of Variables Theorem holds for continuous functions supported on the intersection of local charts) On the other hand, it does not seem clear to me whether the definition $\mu_i(E)=m(E)$ would likewise define a density for a non-paracompact $M$ . In other words, my question is: could we use such definition and obtain a density in a non-paracompact manifold? Edit: the problem was that I guessed the idea for defining the density wrongly! The correct definition for a measurable $E \subset \phi_i(U_i)$ would be $\mu_i(E)=\sum_j \int_{\phi_j(U_j)} \chi_{\phi_j \circ \phi_i^{-1}(E)} (\rho_j \circ \phi_j^{-1}) dm \neq m(E)$ , which is reasonable, as it takes into account how the volume is deformed through the diffeomorphisms between charts.","['measure-theory', 'smooth-manifolds']"

3784423,Exercise 11.1.G Vakil FOAG,"I am trying to solve Ex 11.1.G from Ravi Vakil's FOAG. It says if $X$ is an affine scheme over $k$ , a field and $K|_k$ is an algebraic field extension, then $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ iff $X_K:=X\times_k K$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Here's my attempt at a solution. Let $X=\operatorname{Spec}A$ . Then $X_K=\operatorname{Spec}(A\otimes_k K)$ . The canonical map $X_K \rightarrow X$ , in this case corresponds to the homomorphism of $k$ -algebras namely $A\rightarrow A\otimes_k K$ ; $a\mapsto a\otimes 1$ Since $K|_k$ is an integral extension, so is $A\otimes_k K|_A$ . Thus the Going-Up theorem holds true. Also since $K$ is a free $k$ -module, $A\otimes_k K$ is a free $A$ -module and faithfully flat. Since $A\hookrightarrow A\otimes_k K$ is a flat ring extension, the Going-Down theorem holds true. Now say $P$ be a minimal prime ideal of $A\otimes_k K$ . Then $p:=P \cap A$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$ by Going-Down theorem. Conversely if $p$ is a minimal prime of $A$ and $P$ lies over $p$ (since it is an integral extension) then $P$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A\otimes _k K$ by Incomparability. Assume $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Then for any minimal prime $p$ of $A$ , we have $\operatorname{coht}p=\dim X$ . If $P$ is a minimal prime of $A\otimes _k K$ , then $\operatorname{coht} P =\operatorname{coht} P\cap A=\dim X $ by Going-Up Theorem and Incomparability. Thus $X_K$ is of pure dimension $n$ as well. Now assume $X_K$ is of pure dimension $n$ . Then if $p$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$ , then $p=P\cap A$ where $P$ is a minimal prime of $A\otimes_k K$ . Again by Going-Up and Incomparability, we get $\dim X_K=\operatorname{coht}P=\operatorname{coht} P\cap A $ . Thus $X$ is of pure dimension $n$ . I hope this is a correct solution. I am pretty sure there exists alternative solution along the lines of Vakil's hints or preferably without using flatness since Vakil does not develop it upto this point but I simply can't get it. To be more precise, Vakil has first asked to reduce the problem to $A$ being an integral domain. I am stuck with this part without using the Going-Down theorem for flat ring extensions.

I am looking for an equivariant diffeomorphism $S^2 \times S^3 \rightarrow S^2 \times S^3$ that takes the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ action above, and moves the action to the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ action generated by $(x,q) \mapsto (x,q\overline{j})$ . My issue is that you cannot just use the diffeomorphism $(x,q) \mapsto (R^{T}x,q)$ because $R$ is only being multiplied by the fist coordinate when half of the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ are acting.","['equivariant-maps', 'riemannian-geometry', 'group-actions', 'algebraic-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
3784470,Are all non-associative (not necessarily associative) finite division rings finite fields?,"According to the Artin–Zorn theorem, any finite alternative division ring is a finite field, but I'm interested in the general non-associative (i.e. not necessarily associative) case. Are there any non-associative finite division rings different from finite fields, or are all non-associative finite division rings finite fields? Edit: We define a not necessarily associative division ring to be a set $S$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ such that $S$ with $+$ is an abelian group $S/\{0\}$ with $\cdot$ is a loop (unital quasigroup) $\cdot$ distributes over $+$ . This comes from the following defintion of a division ring: a set $S$ equipped with two binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ such that $S$ with $+$ is an abelian group $S/\{0\}$ with $\cdot$ is a group (associative loop) $\cdot$ distributes over $+$ .","['quasigroups', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
3784472,Find equilibrium points when given polar coordinates,"Consider the following system given in polar coordinates $\dot{r}=-r^3+r+r\sin{(2\theta)}/2$ and $\dot{\theta} = 1+\cos^2{\theta}$ . Find all equilibria and show that there are no invariant circles centered at the origin. I know that when a system is given in cartesian coordinates then we convert to polar coordinates. And to find equilibria, we just look at values of $x$ and $y$ such that $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{y}$ are $0$ . But here, we are given only polar coordinates. Can we convert it back to cartesian coordinates and then find equilibrium points? Otherwise, using polar coordinates, I can think of only origin as the equilibrium point since $r=0$ will yield $\dot{r}=0$ . And no other point will yield $\dot{\theta}=0$ . So would origin be the only equilibrium point? And how do we show there are no invariant circles centered at the origin?",['ordinary-differential-equations']
3784475,Fixed point theorem with one-sided assumption,"The problem is stated as follows: Assume that $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable.
(a) If there is an L < 1 such that for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we have $f '(x) < L$ , prove that there exists a unique point x such that $f(x) =x$ .
(b) Show by example that (a) fails if $L=1$ . I find this problem interesting because, since the derivative has no lower bound, it is not a contraction mapping problem nor is the function necessarily Lipschitz continuous. I think I understand the essence of the problem in that since the function grows at a rate strictly slower than 1 (and a rate not approaching 1), then the graph of the function must necessarily intersect the graph of $y = x$ . Only, I have no idea how to prove this mathematically. Any help with a starting point for proof of this theorem would be greatly appreciated. I tried analyzing the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$ and even $h(x)=f(x) - (x + f(0))$ , but couldn't really see how this lead to a solution.","['fixed-point-theorems', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'functions', 'derivatives']"

3784555,Calculating a Fréchet derivative,"Let $I$ be a set, and let $B(I)$ be the space of bounded, real-valued functions on $I$ equipped with the sup-norm. Let $\phi: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be bounded and continuously differentiable everywhere. Finally, let $S: B(I) \to \mathbb R$ be linear and continuous. Define $\Phi: B(I) \to \mathbb R$ by $\Phi(x) = S(\phi \circ x)$ . Is $\Phi$ Fréchet differentiable at every $x \in B(I)$ , and if so is it the case that $\Phi'(x) = S(\phi' \circ x)$ ? I can show that the function $x \mapsto S(\phi' \circ x)$ is linear and bounded, using the corresponding facts about $\phi'$ and $S$ , but I'm not sure I can show that this function satisfies the definition of the Fréchet derivative. I have to show, for every $x \in B(I)$ , that $$\lim_{\| h \|_\infty \to 0} \frac{| \Phi (x + h) - \Phi(x) -  S(\phi' \circ h) |}{\| h \|_\infty} = 0,\tag{1}$$ where $\| \cdot \|_\infty$ is the sup-norm on $B(I)$ . Now, by the definition of $\Phi$ and the linearity of $S$ $$ \frac{\Phi (x + h) - \Phi(x) -  S(\phi' \circ h)}{\|h\|_\infty} =  \frac{S(\phi \circ (x+h)) - S(\phi \circ x) -  S(\phi' \circ h)}{\|h\|_\infty}  = S\Big(\frac{[\phi \circ(x+h)] - [\phi \circ x] - [\phi' \circ h]}{\|h\|_\infty} \Big).$$ From here I would like to argue that as $\|h\|_\infty \to 0$ , $$\frac{[\phi \circ(x+h)] - [\phi \circ x] - [\phi' \circ h]}{\|h\|_\infty} \to 0, \tag{2}$$ and then use the continuity of $S$ to conclude.

3784563,Maximizing An Integral Using Stokes' Theorem,"Here's a question I've been stuck on: Find a piecewise smooth, simple, closed, oriented curve $C$ which maximizes $$
\int\limits_{C} \vec{F} \,\mathrm{d}\vec{x},\quad \vec{F}(x,y,z)=\big(-y(z+1),x(z+1),0\big)
$$ among all curves $C$ restricted to lie on the three-dimensional unit sphere. I began with computing $$\nabla \times F=\big(-x,-y,2(z+1)\big)$$ which doesn't really simplify the question a lot. Next, I restricted myself to deal with situations where $z$ is held constant. In this situation, by the Stokes' Theorem, and by using Polar Coordinates, I can write out, $$\int\limits_{C} \vec{F}\, \mathrm{d}\vec{x}=\iint\limits_S \big((\nabla \times \vec{F})\cdot \vec{n}\big) r\,\mathrm{d}r\,\mathrm{d}\theta \quad\vec{n}=(0,0,1), r\in(0,a],\theta\in(0,2\pi), z^2=1-a^2 $$ Upon solving this, I got that the integrand is maximized when, $$a=1 \implies z=0\implies x^2+y^2=1$$ I'm trying to generalize this approach to any curve which lies on the unit sphere. However, the primary issue I'm encountering is a lack of a neat expression for the unit normal (for any arbitrary surface satisfying the constraints) which appears in the Stokes' Theorem. I'm not really sure how to proceed any further. Update: 23rd August 2020 So, based on some comments and help from other forums, I got the following idea. The integrand, after the application of Stokes' Theorem, reduces to: $$\iint\limits_S 3z^2+2z-1 dA$$ If you consider the function in the integral on the domain $$z\in[-1,1]$$ , you'll see that the function is non-negative when $$\frac{1}{3}\leq z<1$$ , and non-positive otherwise. Therefore, in order to maximize the integral, we need to consider the surface on the sphere enclosed between the planes $$z=\frac{1}{3}, z=1$$ I used the following parameterization: $$(x,y,z)=(\cos(\theta)\sin(\phi), \sin(\theta)\sin(\phi), \cos(\phi)), 0\leq \theta \leq 2\pi, 0 \leq \phi \leq \frac{\pi}{2}-\arctan{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}}$$ Then, $$\iint\limits_S 3z^2+2z-1 dA=\iint\limits_S (3\cos^2(\phi)+2\cos(\phi)-1)\sin(\phi)d\phi d\theta = \frac{64\pi}{27}$$ I believe this is the maximum...","['integration', 'stokes-theorem']"
3784585,About the definition of the indexed set of a family,"I'm a computer science student currently studying universal algebra by reading the book Foundations of Algebraic Specification and Formal Software Development by Donald Sannella and Andrzej Tarlecki. I'm having a hard time trying to understand the subtleties of indexed families. As far as I know, families are just maps between two sets: $I$ , the index set; and $A$ , the indexed set. That means that $|A|_{i_0}$ , which is the element of $A$ indexed by $i_0$ could be basically anything, like a number, a set, a collection, etc. And that the particular case where $I$ is $\mathbb{N}$ it is called a sequence. However, the definition of the product of an indexed family is: $ \prod_{i\in I} A_i=\{f:I\to \bigcup_{i\in I} A_i: (\forall i_0\in I)(f(i_0)\in A_{i_0})\}$ Considering the definition of a family, then the product could be also defined as the set of all families $ (a_i)_{i \mathop \in I}$ with $|a|_{i_0} \in |A|_{i_0}$ for each $i_0 \in I$ But then, it is implied that the indexed set ( $A$ ) must be a collection (a set of sets), because otherwise, $|A|_{i_0}$ could be an element like a number thus the union of $|A|_i$ would make no sense, since it only works for sets. So why does the definition of a family (at least the ones I've read on several math textbooks) does not require the indexed set to be a collection rather than just a set? Also, would this mean that the elements of a sequence must be sets (containing just one or more elements)? I'm use to thinking about elements of a sequence, specially when studying convergence, as just real numbers. And finally, I will give an example of what I understand so that you could tell me what I'm missing: I will define a family of countries indexed by their currency name. So: $I$ , the index set would be $I = \{pound, dollar,euro\} $ $A$ , the indexed set would be $A = \{\{Spain, Italy, France\},\{UK\},\{US, Canada\}\}$ Then, the family would be a mapping defined as: $(A_i)_{i \in I}= \{pound \rightarrow \{UK\},dollar \rightarrow \{US, Canada\}, euro \rightarrow \{Spain, Italy, France\} \} $ Finally, the product of the family $\prod_{i\in I} A_i$ will consist on a set of mappings (families) where each one of them has $I$ as index set, and maps each index to a set containing just one of the elements of the corresponding subset of $A$ . So in that way, each of these families will map the indexes to one of the six combinations possibles by picking one element from each subset of $A$ . Then the product of the family will be a set of exactly 6 families, somewhat similar to the Cartesian product of the subsets of $A$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'definition', 'universal-algebra']"

Yet I have not been familiar with the concrete calculation of tensor products (though I know the universal property of tensor products, its relation with localization, its exactness and etc.) So beside the above question, I hope to know that what is going on in your mind when calculating the tensor product ? For example, when calculating the quotient ring $k[x,y]/(y-x^2)$ , we can imagine that $y-x^2 = 0$ and hence $y=x^2$ , then in the ring $k[x,y]$ , we can make $y$ be $x^2$ and the quotient ring is isomorphic to $k[x]$ . For example, when calculating the quotient ring $k[x,y]/(1-xy)$ , we can imagine that $xy=1$ and hence $y=1/x$ , then in the ring $k[x,y]$ , we can make $y$ be $1/x$ and the quotient ring is isomorphic to $k[x, 1/x]$ , or the localization $k[x]_{x}$ . Then, when calculating the tensor product, is there a way like these above in mind to help us calculate these?
