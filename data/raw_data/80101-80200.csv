1034109,Why does my professor say that writing $\int \frac 1x \mathrm{d}x = \ln|x| + C$ is wrong?,"My professor says that writing this is convenient
$$\int \frac 1x \mathrm{d}x = \ln|x| + C\tag{1}$$
but wrong, since it should be written as:
$$\int \frac 1x \mathrm{d}x = \begin{cases}\ln x + C &x > 0\quad(\star)\\[0.2em]
\ln(-x) + C &x < 0\end{cases}$$ I was wondering why is that the case. I thought that the two were equivalent, as one can see by the definition of absolute value.
In $(\star)$ the equality sign is dropped because the logarithm is not defined in $0$, but that would be the case with $(1)$ as well.","['logarithms', 'calculus', 'integration', 'indefinite-integrals']"
1034150,Is there a specific name for this set of square-rooted primes?,"Consider the set of all the primes numbers (Â± square rooted) and all the irrational numbers that can be formed under their addition (only the addition of finitely many elements is allowed, i.e. no limits). We also include 0, as the identity element into this set. Is this set a group? I believe yes. For example $7^{0.5}+3^{0.5}+5^{0.5}$ can be formed by adding $7^{0.5}+ 7^{0.5}+3^{0.5}+5^{0.5}+11^{0.5}$ and $-11^{0.5}$, (and infinitely many other other pairs of elements). However, I have a doubt. Say we want to form $11^{0.5}$ from $5^{0.5}$ without resorting to the addition of $-5^{0.5}+11^{0.5}$. I believe that no finite sum of irrational primes (hence element) of the set exists such that $x=-5^{0.5}+11^{0.5}$. So now I wonder, what could this set be called (I haven't formally studied mathematics. Can it be regarded as a group, for I am not sure if it can fairly said to satisfy the latin square property. I am tempted to say that is does, but then again, is there a very specific name for the group I seem to have described, with its particular characteristic of ""fundamental"" elements and ""constructed"" elements?

1034156,Ways to prove $ \int_0^\pi \frac{\sin^2 nx}{\sin^2 x} dx= n\pi$,"In how many ways can we prove the following theorem? $$I(n):= \int_0^\pi \frac{\sin^2 nx}{\sin^2 x} dx= n\pi$$ where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. The proof I found is by considering $I(n+1)-I(n)$ , which can be reduced to $$
g(n):= \int_0^\pi \frac{\sin(2 n x) \cos x}{\sin x}dx
$$ I then showed that $g(n)=g(n+1)$ , with $g(n) = ng(1) = n\pi$ . This completes the proof. I was wondering if there is a more direct way to prove it. By 'direct' I mean without deriving auxiliary recursions.","['definite-integrals', 'trigonometry', 'trigonometric-integrals', 'integration']"

1034247,How does $\int_0^\infty e^{-t^4}dt = \Gamma (\frac{5}{4}) ?$,"My text book claims that $$\int_0^\infty e^{-t^4}dt = \Gamma \left(\frac{5}{4}\right).$$ I fail to see this. By the definition of the gamma function we have
$$\Gamma (z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt.$$ Thus, plugging in $\frac{5}{4}$ for $z$ should give us

1034276,Fourier Transform of Newton's Law of Cooling,"I am attempting to solve Newton's Law of Cooling differential equation with Fourier Transforms for a high school math report. Can Fourier Transforms be used to solve first-order ODEs? The equation is: $\frac{dT}{dt} = -kT + kT_a$, where $k$ and $T_a$ are constants. Since the Fourier Transform is a linear operator, I took the transform of each of the three terms: $$F\{T'\} = F\{-kT\} + F\{kT_a\}$$ $$F\{T'\} =  -kF\{T\} + kT_aF\{1\}$$ The Fourier transform of 1 should be $\delta(s)$, so: $$F\{T'\} = -kF\{T\} + kT_a\delta(s)$$ The transform of the derivative of a function, using $s$ instead of $\omega$ in the formulas, is $F\{T'\} = 2\pi isF\{T\}$. Substituting this into the original equation, $$2\pi isF\{T\} = -kF\{T\} + kT_a\delta(s)$$ Adding the terms with the transform should yield $$2\pi isF\{T\} +kF\{T\} = kT_a\delta(s)$$ $$F\{T\}(2\pi is +k) = kT_a\delta(s)$$ $$F\{T\} = \frac{kT_a\delta(s)}{2\pi is + k}$$. The formula for the Inverse Fourier Transform is $f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2\pi ist} F(s) ds$. Thus $$T = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{e^{2\pi ist} \delta(s) kT_a}{2\pi is + k}ds$$, which I evaluated to $T_a$, dropping the integral and plugging in 0 for $s$ due to the $\delta(s)$ function...however, the actual solution to the differential equation is $T_a + Ae^{-kt}$, where A is a constant.

1034278,"If a linear operator has an adjoint operator, it is bounded","This is a question I'm struggling with for a while: Let $H$ be a Hilber space. Let  $T,S: H\rightarrow H$ be linear operators (not neccessarily bounded) such that for every $x,y\in H$: $\langle Tx,y\rangle=\langle x,Sy \rangle$. Prove $T,S$ are bounded. What I did so far: First attempt: $||Tx||^2=\langle Tx,Tx\rangle=\langle x,STx\rangle\le||x||*||STx||\le||x||*||S||*||Tx||$ I'm not entirly sure I'm allowed to do the last inequallity, since $||S||$ might be $\infty$. It follows $||Tx||\le ||x||*||S||$ and analogly $||Sx||\le ||x||*||T||$ From the first I'd get $||T||\le ||S||$ and from the second $||S||\le||T||$. Therefore $||S||=||T||$.
I don't know where to go from here. Second Attempt:
assume  $T$ isn't bounded, therefore so is $S$, therefore there are series $(x_n),(y_n)\subset H$ such that $||x_n||=||y_n||=1$ and $\lim ||Tx_n||=\infty,\lim ||Sy_n||=\infty$.

1034288,Prove every prime ideal of a ring is a radical ideal.,"this is my attempt: Since $R$ is commutative, we let $I$ to be a prime ideal of $R$, the for $a,b\in R$,then the product $ab$ we must have that $a\in I$ or $b \in I$, by definition of a prime ideal. On the other hand,we have: $radI = \{r\in R | r^n\in I $ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}\}$. so the argument goes by induction on $(ab)^n$, for $n=1$ is just the definition of a prime ideal, so we assume that its true for $n$. now for $n+1$, we have the product: $(ab)^{n+1}= (ab)^n(ab)= (a^{n}a)(b^{n}b)$, but if $a\in I$, then $a^n\in I$, similarly if $b\in I$, then $b^n\in I$, therefore we thus have that $radI=I$. Now, i need to give an example that the converse is false, so if $a,b\in radI$, then $a^n\in I$ and $b^n\in I$, so when we consider the product $a^nb^n=(ab)^n$, we thus have that $a^n\in I$ and $b^n\in I$, therefore $I$ cant be a prime ideal.

Suppose we have a set of fruits, costs, and their associated provisions Apples cost \$1 and provide 1HP, 3MP, 2STA Oranges cost \$2 and provide 2HP, 3STA Pears cost \$3 and provide 2MP, 4STA If I require 10HP, 7MP, and 12STA, how do I optimize for the following: Generate fruit combinations which go as minimally in excess of the requirements (you know, because wasting fruit is bad) Consume as few fruits as possible to fully satisfy the requirements Spend as little money as possible to fully satisfy the requirements The problem illustrated is obviously trivial, but if the number of fruits can approach dozens or even hundreds, and the number of required parameters HP, MP, STA, etc. can also reach dozens, the combinatorial space becomes computationally prohibitive, so I need another approach. What are some possible alternatives that may not be perfect, but give an asymptotically increasingly accurate answer? Some approach thoughts I've had but haven't fully pursued due to intuited problems with the approach: Brute force (the permutations become innumerable and the computation time even worse) Multidimensional hill-climbing algorithm with a distribution of starting points (not sure what ""up"" means in this approach) Linear Programming (The selection process doesn't appear linear?

In the following $\nu$ is the surface-normal and $e_1,e_2,e_3$ the Frenet 3-frame. It states: Every asymptotic curve $c: I \rightarrow S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$  ( $II(c',c')=0$, where $II$ is the second fundamental form) with curvature $\kappa \neq 0$ and torsion $\tau$ satisfies the equation $\tau^2=-K$, where $\tau$ is the torsion of the curve and $K$ the GauÃ-curvature of the surface $S$. Proof: Let $c(s)$ be an aymptotic curve with $II(c',c')=0$. Then the normal curvature of $c$ vanishes. Hence, $e_2$ is tangential to the surface (so far is everything alright), but now it goes on with, then $e_3 = \nu$. 
I mean, I see that $e_3$ is then either $+ \nu$ or $- \nu$, but I don't see why the $+$ sign is already clear here. Then it goes on like $\tau= \langle e_2',e_3 \rangle = \langle e_2', \nu \rangle $ which is just definition and the fact we just proved, but now it is claimed that this is equal to $II(e_1,e_2).$ Then the author claims that 
$K = Det(II)/Det(I) = II(e_1,e_1)II(e_2,e_2) - (II(e_1,e_2))^2 = 0 - \tau^2.$ Apparently, the determinant of the metric tensor is supposed to be equal to one here(why?).

\begin{align}
f_1(x,y,z,u,v) &= xy^2+xzu+yv^2-3 \\
f_2(x,y,z,u,v) &= u^3yz+2xv-u^2v^2-2

1035393,Minimal polynomials and cyclic subspaces,"I'm trying to make my way through two problems in Curtis's Linear Algebra , chapter 25.  One of the two problems is this one, #5: Prove that $V$ is cyclic relative to a linear transformation $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ if and only if the minimal polynomial of $T$ is equal to the characteristic polynomial. Part of the issue is that I'm not really sure what it's asking. The statement that $V$ is cyclic seems to suggest that the entire vector space (say it has dimension $n$) is generated by some vector $v \in V$, along with $Tv, T^2v, \ldots T^{n-1}v$; Curtis's definition of a cyclic subspace (as opposed to a space, though I can't see why there should be a difference) seems to reinforce this: A $T$-invariant subspace $V_1$ of $V$ is called cyclic relative to $T$ if $V_1 \neq 0$ and there exists a vector $v_1 \in V_1$ such that $V_1$ is generated by $\{ v_1, Tv_1, T^2v_1, \ldots T^kv_1 \}$ for some $k$. However, I've seen several examples that seem to directly contradict this interpretation. For example, we recently had a take-home midterm that required we find elementary divisors, rational canonical form, etc., of a $6\times 6$ matrix; a classmate who received a perfect score on her test found that her matrix's characteristic polynomial was equal to its minimal polynomial â it was $(x+8)^2 (x+14)^2 (x^2+61x+80)$ â and yet the vector space could be written as $\left< v_6 \right> \oplus \left< v_4 \right> \oplus \left< -v_2+v_3+v_6 \right>$ â i.e., as the direct sum of three cyclic subspaces, not as one cyclic subspace. So that suggests that ""$V$ is cyclic"" might mean the direct sum of cyclic subspaces. However, while working on the exercise that follows (#6), I came across this: $$S= \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}\right)$$ Here, the characteristic polynomial is not equal to the minimal polynomial, which is $m(x) = (x-1)(x+1)(x+2)$. The eigenspace associated with $\lambda = 1$ has dimension $2$. And so it seems as though, if $V$ has basis $\{ v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 \}$, we can write $V = \left< v_1 \right> \oplus \left< v_2 \right> \oplus \left< v_3 \right> \oplus \left< v_4 \right> $. This would seem to contradict my second interpretation of the original question. Obviously I'm missing something. Could someone fill me in on what it might be?

There are no hints, but given the placement in the book, the goal is presumably to use Baire category. I have never seen a non-measure based proof of this result, so I gave it a try.  I'm a bit stuck, though.  It's clear that Baire tells us that one of the sets $\bigcup_{n=k}^\infty B(r_n,2^{-n})$ for $k \in \mathbb{N}$ must not be dense, but I'm not sure how to use this information to prove the result.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Here are the details on my above claim.  Set $U_k = \bigcup_{n=k}^\infty B(r_n,2^{-n})$, which is clearly open.  Suppose, BWOC, that each $U_k$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^N$.  Then Baire says that $\bigcap_{k=0}^\infty U_k$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^N$, but on the other hand by construction $\bigcap_{k=0}^\infty U_k = \varnothing$.  This contradiction means we must have $E_k$ not dense for some $k$. EDIT 2: As pointed out in the comments below, this argument doesn't seem to fly.

is $$X(n+1)=\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$ I used induction to show that. I have done the following: For $n=0$ : $X(1)=1 \checkmark $ We assume that it stands for each $1 \leq k \leq n$:
$$X(k)=\frac{1}{k}\binom{2(k-1)}{k-1} \ \ \ \ \ (*)$$ We want to show that it stands for $n+1$: $$X(n+1)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} X(i)X(n+1-i)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{i}\binom{2(i-1)}{i-1}\frac{1}{n+1-i}\binom{2(n-i)}{n-i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{i}\frac{(2(i-1))!}{(i-1)!(2(i-1)-(i-1))!}\frac{1}{n+1-i}\binom{(2(n-i))!}{(n-1)!(2(n-i)-(n-i))!}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(2(i-1))!}{i!(i-1)!}\frac{(2(n-i))!}{(n-i+1)!(n-i)!}$$ How could I continue??","['induction', 'recurrence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1035933,Chapter dependency tree for Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry,"I'm self-studying Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry and I need some guidance. I've studied chapter I (varieties) and sections 1, 2 and 3 of chapter II (schemes). Do I need to study all sections in chapter II before moving on to chapter III (cohomology)? Or is it the case that some sections in chapter II can be skipped in a first reading? What's the optimal strategy for studying the sections of the book? I'm asking because in some other books I studied, more advanced sections where tagged as optional for a first reading. I found that getting back to them after getting a comprehensive understanding of the essentials much more efficient than attacking advanced sections in the middle of a first reading. Thank you","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request']"

If you know the position, velocity, acceleration and so on of a particle you can predict it's location at any time.

1036001,"Show that $u(x)=\ln\left(\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\right)$ is in $W^{1,n}(U)$, where $U=B(0,1)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$.","The entire problem statement is: Let $n>1$ and let $U=B(0,1)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Show that $u:U\to\mathbb{R}$ given by 
$$u(x)=\ln\left(\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\right)$$ is in $W^{1,n}(U).$ My attempt at the proof is as follows: To show that $u\in W^{1,n}(U)$ it suffices to show that $|Du|\in L^{n}(U)$. Consider
$$u_{x_i}=\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{|x|}}|x|^{-2}\frac{x_i}{|x|},$$
which simplifies to,
$$u_{x_i}=\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{|x|}}\frac{x_i}{|x|^3}.$$
Thus,
$$|Du|=\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{|x|}}\frac{1}{|x|^2}$$
which can be manipulated to,
$$|Du|=\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{1+|x|}\frac{1}{|x|}.$$ Moreover, since $U=B(0,1)$ we can bound the second term from above which gives,
$$|Du|\leq\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{|x|}$$ Thus, we can instead show that
$$\int_U\left(\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{|x|}\right)}\frac{1}{|x|}\right)^n<\infty.$$ Converting this into polar coordinates we have with $r=|x|$,
$$\int_0^R\int_{\partial B(0,r)}\left(\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)}\frac{1}{r}\right)^n\,dSdr=\int_0^R\left(\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)}\frac{1}{r}\right)^n\int_{\partial B(0,r)}dSdr$$
Note that $\int_{\partial B(0,r)}\,dS=n\alpha(n)r^{n-1}$, which is the surface area of $B(0,r)$. Thus, we have then
$$n\alpha(n)\int_0^R\left(\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)}\frac{1}{r}\right)^nr^{n-1}\,dr=n\alpha(n)\int_0^R\left(\frac{1}{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{r}\right)}\right)^n\frac{1}{r}\,dr$$ And so this is where I get stuck in the problem, since I don't how I can evaluate that last integral to show it's finite.

1036019,"If $G$ has no proper subgroup, then $G$ is cyclic of prime order","This is something I'm supposed to be able to prove for an upcoming test, but I can't find anything to help me prove this in my notes or the chapter, which is on cosets and Lagrange's theorem.

1036021,Laplace transform and Fourier transform of kernel,"Suppose $p_t(x)=\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi t}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2t}}$ is the Gaussian density. $p_t(x)$ is also the Green kernel of the heat equation in 1D: $(\partial_t-\frac12\Delta)u=0$. The Fourier transform of $p_t(x)$ is $\hat p_t(\xi)=e^{-\frac{t}2|\xi|^2}$. Then the Laplace transform at 1 has the special bound
$$\int_0^\infty e^{-t}|\hat p_t(\xi)|^2dt=\int_0^\infty e^{-t}e^{-t|\xi|^2}dt\lesssim \frac1{1+|\xi|^2}. $$
In this bound, we see that this integration decay as $|\xi|^{-2}$ when $|\xi|\to\infty$. Note also that the Laplace transform is closely related to resolvent of the operator $\Delta$. Suppose now that we replace $\Delta$ by a ""nice"" (symmetric) operator $A$ with symbol $\psi(\xi)$. What are the characteristics of $A$ so that we have a similar bound
$$\int_0^\infty e^{-\lambda t}|e^{-t\psi(\xi)}|^2dt\lesssim \frac1{1+|\xi|^a} $$
for some $\lambda>0$ and $a>0$. Is there a method to identify the decay rate $a$? PS: I know this is probably well known in semigroup theory, but I couldn't find any exact reference.","['probability-theory', 'semigroup-of-operators', 'operator-theory']"
1036033,Show stable node or spiral cannot occur,"If I have the equation:
$$\ddot{x} + f(\dot{x}) + g(x) = 0$$
where $f$ is even and $f$ and $g$ are both smooth, how do I show that the equilibrium points cannot be stable nodes or spirals? What I've done so far is:
$$\dot{x} = y$$
$$\dot{y} = F(x,y) = -f(y) - g(x)$$
I can try to take the Jacobian at the fixed points
$$J = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}
\end{pmatrix}$$
but without knowing the values of $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$ I can't tell what type of fixed points can occur. My best guess is that, based on the information in the question, there must be some restriction on the values $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ or $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$ can take, which would then rule out the possibility of stable nodes or spirals. However, I can't seem to find any such restrictions. Any help would be appreciated!",['ordinary-differential-equations']
