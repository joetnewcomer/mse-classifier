4932106,Generic bound on quadratic character sum,"Let $\chi$ be the non-trivial quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_q$ , and let $f(x)$ be a square-free polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ . Then by the Weil bound, we have the generic estimate $|\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}_q}\chi(f(x))|\le \deg(f)q^{1/2}$ . Say we now deal with a function $f(x,y)\in \mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$ , so that we look for a bound on $|\sum_{x,y\in\mathbb{F}_q}\chi(f(x,y))|$ . Do we have any similar generic bound, perhaps using the full power of the Weil conjectures? This is basically the number of points on the surface $z^2=f(x,y)$ , but I don't know how to use the Weil conjectures to bound the number of points on this surface. Edit: one could approach this by fixing $x$ and showing thay the resulting polynomial in $y$ is generically squarefree (or not a square). Thia gives a bound of order $q^{3/2}$ if works. I wonder if there's some tighter bound.","['number-theory', 'finite-fields', 'characters', 'algebraic-geometry', 'exponential-sum']"
4932148,Difference of ≡ and ⇔ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : What's the difference between $\equiv$ and $\leftrightarrow$ in a formal proof? (4 answers) Closed 16 days ago . I'm studying cs in germany, I have been going through my script starting with propositional logic. I don't really understand the difference between those. I watched some YT-Videos on the topic but i didn't really helped me differentiate between those. They just sometimes use one or the other. ""Definition"" in my own words (my understanding): The script says something like "" $A ⇔ B$ "" gets when "" $A ↔ B$ "" is true. So only if both statements A, B are true or both are false "" $A ⇔ B$ "" would get used. The Term "" $A ≡ B$ "" gets used if two logical Terms (consisting of Variables, Constants, ...) result in a equal logical value. Example: $A ↔ B ⇔ (A → B) ∧ (B → A)$ $A ∧ (B ∧ C) ≡ (A ∧ B) ∧ C$ . Problem:When given to ""equal"" statements they will be right and wrong the same time therefore i can use $⇔$ . But they also will have the same logical value so i can use $≡$ . I can't really differentiate between them. Almost a different question. Why do the de morgan laws use ↔, why don't the use one of $≡, ⇔$ ? $¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)$ .
English is not my first language and i translated my question mostly by myself. Also its my first time asking a question here.","['logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4932165,Closed range of $T^*T$ for Hilbert space map.,"Earlier today, I came across a paper that stated (but did not prove!) the following theorem. Theorem : Let $T:A \rightarrow B$ be a bounded linear Hilbert space map. Then the following are equivalent. $T$ has closed range; $T^*$ has closed range; $T^*T$ has closed range. The equivalence of (1) and (2) easily follows from the closed range theorem for Banach spaces. I have also managed to show that (1) + (2) implies 3 by using the identity $\text{image}(T) = \ker(T^*)^\perp$ , which holds when $T$ has closed range. This identity allows you to show that if $T$ has closed range, then $T^*T$ and $T^*$ have the same range. I am struggling to show that (3) implies the other conditions though. It seems like there should be a way to maybe take advantage of the fact that $\ker(T^*T) = \ker(T)$ and $\ker(T^*T)^\perp = \text{image}(T^*T)$ (since $T^*T$ has closed range). But I’m not seeing how to put the pieces together. If anyone has a reference for this result, or knows how to prove it, I’d appreciate it!","['hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"
4932219,How do I find the absolute maximum and minimum values of the Lamb-Oseen Vortex?,"I am researching alternative solutions to Stokes equations and I came across a problem with the Lamb-Oseen vortex I cannot solve that I hope will allow easier derivations of vortex functions with boundary conditions, such as restricting vortex growth and confining laminar radial flow. For example, if stirring coffee in a cup has a solution in cylindrical coordinates given ideal flow conditions, I want to find it mathematically and compare this behavior with experimental results. For an angular velocity function derived by Navier-Stokes, $$ \omega \left(r,t\right)=\frac{\omega _0R_0^2}{R\left(t\right)^2}exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{R\left(t\right)^2}\right)$$ from which the azimuthal velocity $u_\theta$ component of the vector field in cylindrical coordinates, $\vec{u}$ , derived by vorticity, $\vec{\omega }=\nabla \times \vec{u}= \nabla \times \vec{u_\theta}$ , is the vortex function, $$v_\theta (r,t)=\frac{\omega _0R_0^2}{r} \left ( 1- e^{-\frac{r^2}{R(t)^2}} \right )$$ This is equivalent to the Lamb Oseen equation for some $ \Gamma_0 = 2\omega_0 \pi R_{0}^2$ , where, $\Gamma_0$ is the initial circulation. Question: How do I find the max/min values of $u_\theta$ for all $R>0$ assuming that $R_{0}>0$ in $ R(t)=\sqrt{4\nu t +R_{0}^2}$ ? So far, to find the $r$ locating the max, I have taken the partial derivative of $u_\theta$ w.r.t $r$ , set this equal to zero, and attempted to solve for $r$ in, $$\frac{\partial u_{\theta }}{\partial r}=0$$ $$\frac{\partial u_{\theta }}{\partial r}=\omega _0R_0\left(-\frac{1}{r^2}+\frac{1}{r^2}e^{-\frac{r^2}{R^2}}+\frac{2}{R^2}e^{-\frac{r^2}{R^2}}\right)=0$$ which reduces down to a seemingly unsolvable form. $$\frac{r^2}{R^2}=ln\left(\frac{2r^2+R^2}{R^2}\right)$$ I looked into the Lambert W function, but haven't turned up algebraically exact solutions. Using the abs-max value for $\omega(r,t)$ , $$\left(\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}},\:\frac{\omega _0R_0^2}{R^2}\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}}\right),\left(-\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}},\:-\frac{\omega \:_0R_0^2}{R^2}\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}}\right)$$ I approximated for $u_\theta$ to be, $$\left(\pm \:\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)},\pm \:\frac{\omega \:_0R_0^2}{R^2}\sqrt{\frac{R^2}{2}\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)}\right)$$ Is there an exact set of solutions to $\frac{\partial u_{\theta }}{\partial r}=0$ ?","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'vector-fields', 'fluid-dynamics']"
4932220,Finding a open subset of a open set whose closure is also contained in the open set,"This may be dumb, but I am trying to prove the following statement. Let $(X,\mathcal{T})$ be a topological space. For every $U\in\mathcal{T}$ , for every $x\in U$ , there exists $V\in\mathcal{T}$ such that $x\in V$ and $\overline{V}\subseteq U$ . I am reading Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds and his proposition for $3.9$ . He had the following claim: ""Let $B$ be a neighbourhood of $p$ such that $\overline{B}\subseteq U$ ."" I am wondering why such a choice is always possible.",['general-topology']
4932228,Evaluation of limit of integrals where calculus tricks don't work,"Suppose that we want to evaluate $\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_0^1 \frac{n x^n}{1+x^3} \, dx$ . Clearly the standard limit theorems for integration (Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, monotone convergence theorem, etc.) don't work here, as the answer is $1/2$ .  There's at least three ways to prove this converges to $1/2$ . $1) \ $ Set $u = x^n$ .  This converts the problem to $\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_0^1 \frac{u^\frac{1}{n}}{1+u^\frac{3}{n}} \, du$ and now using the bounded convergence theorem this is trivially $1/2$ $2) \ $ Integrating by parts, setting $dv = nx^n \, dx$ and $u = \frac{1}{1+x^3}$ .  Then $u(1) v(1) - u(0)v(0) = \frac{n}{2(n+1)}$ while $\displaystyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_0^1 v \, du = 0$ rather trivially $3) \ $ Avoiding any calculus tricks:  Fix small $\epsilon > 0$ and write $\displaystyle \int_0^1 \frac{n x^n}{1+x^3} \, dx = \int_0^{1-\epsilon} \frac{n x^n}{1+x^3} \, dx + \int_{1-\epsilon}^1 \frac{n x^n}{1+x^3} \, dx$ .  As $n \rightarrow \infty$ the first integral converges to zero by uniform convergence.  In the second one, we have $\frac12 \leq \frac{1}{1 + x^3} \leq \frac{1}{1 + (1-\epsilon)^3}$ while $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\int_{1-\epsilon}^1 nx^n \, dx = 1$ . To make this precise, the easiest thing (in my opinion) is to play with $\liminf$ and $\limsup$ and then let $\epsilon \rightarrow 0^+$ , which (again in my opinion) makes performing $3)$ very useful pedagogical (as is breaking an integral up and estimating each piece, instead of using calculus). So my question is: are there similar examples as above (concrete examples where the standard limit theorems of integration don't apply) where you $\textit{can't}$ use calculus tricks to evaluate the limit, and where you $\textit{must}$ estimate like in $3)$ (or estimate in a more sophisticated manner?)","['lebesgue-integral', 'limits', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis']"
4932306,Is a connected space possible if it is Hausdorff? (T2),"Getting into topology this semester and have been studying and doing some exercises and I was wondering if a Hausdorff space i.e: $ {\displaystyle \forall \,x,y\in X\,|\,x\neq y\,\exists \,U,V{\text{ open sets of }}x,y\,|\,U\cap V=\varnothing }$ Could eventually be a connected space ie:
X is connected, that is, it cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets.
,even if at first to me they seem to counter each other there are claims they exists, but I can't find any examples and I just found this very poor wiki link.
Of course if anyone has a proof I would more than appreciate it or any literature that could give me an answer https://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Connected_Hausdorff_space#:~:text=There%20do%20exist%20countably%20infinite%20connected%20Hausdorff%20spaces .","['general-topology', 'connectedness']"

4932366,Technique for showing a group is not free?,"The specific case I present here is much less important than the general question. I have two matrices: $$
p = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & -\frac{1}{2} \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1

1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\

Is there a program that can help me search for such non-trivial identities? Is there a way to do it in Sage? (I'm afraid I'm very new to sage, so don't know much about it). Ideally there would be some general way of dealing with this for general matrices. At the moment I don't have a better technique than simple trial and error. EDIT: I have gotten sage to run: from sage.groups.free_group import is_FreeGroup

p = matrix(QQ, [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, -1/2], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1]])
q = matrix(QQ, [[1, -1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]])

G = MatrixGroup([p, q])

is_FreeGroup(G) Which returns False. But I don't know how to have it tell me which non-trivial relation the generators satisfy. Is there a way to tell me which group it is isomorphic to? (I have a hunch it is isomorphic to the Heisenberg group: 3x3 upper triangular matrices with 1 on the diagonal)","['group-theory', 'free-groups', 'sagemath']"
4932383,Quotient of Special Linear Group by its centre,"I am currently writing my Master's Thesis about Moduli Spaces of Groups Representations via the GIT quotient, i.e. in the context of Algebraic Geometry. Hence, algebraic groups are fundamental objects of study. For the general theory of algebraic groups, I have mainly studied the book by Humphreys. However, via a MathStack post, I saw that a fundamental result on quotients of linear algebraic groups was in the book of Springer, so I took a look of it. It is the following: Proposition 5.5.10 Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group and $H$ a closed, normal subgroup. (i) $G/H$ is an affine variety. (ii) Provided with the usual group structure, $G/H$ is a linear algebraic group. Let us focus on the particular case $G=\mathsf{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ . Its centre is the group $$ Z:=Z(\mathsf{SL}(n,\mathbb{C}))=\{ \lambda I_n:\lambda^n=1 \}, $$ where $I_n$ denotes the $n\times n$ identity matrix. Since $Z$ is isomorphic to the group of $n$ -th roots of unity, $Z$ is a finite subgroup, so it looks that it is a closed subgroup. Hence, the above proposition should implies that $\mathsf{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})/Z\cong \mathsf{PSL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is a linear algebraic group. However, I have read some MathStack posts (see $\operatorname{PSL}_n$ as an algebraic group ) which talk about how this group is NOT an algebraic group and not a variety at all. Am I misunderstanding something? Thank you in advance!","['group-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups']"
4932438,What is the name of this group-like structure?,"I noticed this group-like structure popping up all over place. Below is a realization of the structure in first order rational functions. The structure has only six elements ( Edit: it's tempting to think it's some group like $S_3$ , but I will later note that crucially, the three sets of elements I describe below each have a distinct additive operation only defined on that subset, and there are 4 operations in total, but the structure is still closed, and has identities and inverses). Define $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be complementary fractions (real numbers between 0 and 1 such that $x_1+x_2=1$ ). Define $y_1$ and $y_2$ to be the ratios between the complementary fractions, i.e. $y_1=\frac{x_1}{x_2}$ , $y_2=\frac{x_2}{x_1}$ . Define $n_1$ and $n_2$ to be the multiplicative inverses of $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively. I'll include a diagram of operations between the elements later in the post, but I first want to show examples of where this structure pops up, to show why I'm motivated to understand it. An example of this structure in probability theory is if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are probabilities of complementary events. Then $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the expected numbers of tries one needs to perform to get 1 success on the associated events. Then $y_1$ and $y_2$ are the odds (e.g. 7:1 or 19:20, if one wants to use the limited colon notation for odds). A second example of where this occurs is if we let $x_1=\sin^2 x$ , $x_2=\cos^2 x$ , $n_1=\csc^2 x$ , $n_2=\sec^2 x$ , $y_1=\tan^2 x$ , and $y_2=\cot^2 x$ . A third example is in circuit theory. If we have two elements sharing a branch or a node, then voltage or current division follows this algebra/group-thing. If you're an electrical engineer, you might also see glimpses of this structure when dealing with BJT transistors. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are in fact $x_1$ and $y_1$ which is why $\beta=\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}$ and $\alpha=\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}$ . The reason why this structure is fascinating to me is that every element can be transformed into another element by the use of a simple first-order rational function, but of a specific form. For example $n_1=\frac{n_2}{n_2-1}$ (and this specific transformation is special in that it is an involution, along with the more obvious $1-x$ and $1/x$ in the structure). Various other interesting functions like $\frac{x}{x+1}$ , $\frac{x}{1-x}$ and their one-complements and multiplicative inverses (which also simlplify to (1,0), (0,1), or (1,1) rational functions of same form, where the criteria for sameness is left vague by me, but I hope you can see the general form and which rational functions satisfy this form) can be studied in this structure and reveal cool patterns. Here is a picture of how the structure looks like under all allowed operations: Important Edit: PLEASE look at the diagram carefully. This does not seem associative in a way that a group would be! Note that there are in total 4 operations, 1-, -1, +1, and 1/. Not all operations can be used on all elements. The three additive-flavor operations for example are only defined on the x's, n's, or y's respectively. However, the 1/ operation is universal in the structure. The elements neatly sort themselves into two groups of three and three groups of two based on these allowed operations. Finally, I want to mention that the rational functions participating in transformations between the elements can be extended to all rational functions with unity coefficients, of order 1 in 2 variables $a,b$ by defining $x_1=\frac{a}{a+b}$ and $x_2=\frac{b}{a+b}$ . I don't have a proof of this, this argument follows from intuition and might not be precisely correct. But this all just intrigues me so much. This is in fact the starting point from which I discovered this structure; I'm an electrical engineering student and I noticed that voltage division for example has $x_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}$ , and if one allows for negative resistance (as in active devices), you might have something like $\frac{R_a}{R_a-R_b}$ which falls into this extended structure too. You can even further extend this structure by defining a dual set of these once-extended rational functions over additional variables 1/a and 1/b. This fits nicely into the electrical engineering picture because it actually gives a ton of intuitive insight on some relationships between resistances, conductances, and their series and parallel configurations! For example, the equivalence $\frac{R_1}{R_1+(R_2+R_3)}=\frac{G_2\|G_3}{G_1 + G_2 \| G_3}$ (where $R_i=\frac{1}{G_i}$ , and $A\|B=\frac{AB}{A+B}$ ) can be established more intuitively in this way, if one studies the structure deeply. Note that the sum of resistances is the inverse of the parallel configuration of conductances, i.e. $\frac{1}{R_1+R_2}=G_1\|G_2=\left(\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\|\left(\frac{1}{R_2}\right)$ . Hope I demonstrated well enough why this structure is interesting to me. Does anyone know what this is? Edit: Also, what are these extensions to the structure that I described at the end?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'rational-functions']"
