3506984,Can the fact that $\bigcap _{g\in G}gHg^{-1}\lhd G$ be used to prove that certain groups are not simple?,"If $G$ is finite, and $H$ a proper subgroup (which existence is often easy to show by using Sylow Theory), it would be sufficient to prove $core_G(H)=\bigcap _{g\in G}gHg^{-1}\neq \{ 1\}$ to conclude that $G$ is not simple since we know $core_G(H)\lhd G$ . Also, some proofs regarding groups of particular order (say, groups of order $p^nq$ for primes $p$ & $q$ ) not being simple are somewhat long and I'm just in hopes of not having to learn them for my exam. In the infinite case there is some merit to $core_G(H)$ in this regard, since by Poincare's Theorem (namely, if $G$ has a subgroup $H$ with finite index, then $core_G(H)$ also has a finite index in $G$ ) if an infinite group has a subgroup of finite index, then it is not simple. For a finite group $G$ and $H< G$ , I've tried without success to find useful conditions for which $core_G(H)\neq 1$ , so I'm wondering if there are non-trivial sufficient conditions for which $$core_G(H)\neq 1$$","['simple-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'soft-question']"
3507063,Large prime factors in a sequence of consecutive numbers,"When trying to solve a number theory problem I came across this other problem which sounds interesting. Let $n$ be a positive integer, and consider $n$ consecutive positive integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ that are at most $n^2$ . What is an upper bound for the number of integers in this kind of list that have a prime factor greater than $n$ ? What's interesting is that for any such prime factor, it appears only once as a factor in the list, and there can only be at most $n$ such primes. I'm guessing that $n$ is too large an upper bound and cannot be reached, i.e. there is always at least one number with prime factors all less than or equal to $n$ . I don't have any results besides checking some lists of numbers, and I don't really know how to approach this. Any ideas?","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"

$$ Where the output of $J(n)$ is grouped by power of two. Using the concrete table (and thus $\alpha = 1$ , $\beta = -1$ , and $\gamma = 1$ )I think I understand why $\alpha$ 's coefficient is $n$ 's largest power of 2 i.e. we're just representing symbolically what the concrete table has. Similarly for $\beta$ 's coefficient decreasing: the $J(n)$ output starts small so we need a negative $\beta$ of larger magnitude at the start to get 1, then reducing the magnitude i.e. for $n=4$ to $n=7$ it is $3\beta$ , $2\beta$ , and $\beta$ . Then we need to start counting upwards with $\gamma$ so $J(n)$ 's output increases: using example above of $n$ 4 to 7 it is $\gamma$ , $2\gamma$ , and $3\gamma$ . It almost seems like there is some kind of ""middle"" that $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are relative to.

3507180,Understanding the roles of rapid decay & smoothness in the Fourier transform,"1) If we define a rapidly decaying function in the usual way, it says nothing about derivatives; rather, just that its decay beats any polynomial growth. 2) A Schwartz class function is then simply a smooth function that is also rapidly decaying. 2) A Schwartz class function is not only smooth, but it and all of its derivatives are also rapidly decaying. 3) The Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the Schwartz class functions to themselves. This all feels very beautiful and deep, like a truth underlying something much bigger. At first glance it seems like rapid decay is such a powerful condition, and that smoothness is something quite common and boring. Because of these assumptions, I wouldn't have been surprised if the rapid decay condition for Schwartz class functions was the ""more important"" of the two conditions (whatever that means... perhaps that there is a loosening of the condition that could still lead to some interesting analysis? ) But as soon as you take away the smoothness condition, things start to unravel: Obviously $e^{-|x|}$ is rapidly decreasing, but it of course fails to be smooth at $x=0$ . And its Fourier transform ends up being $\frac{2}{1+\omega}$ , which is certainly not rapidly decreasing any longer. Strange... But for all $\epsilon > 0$ , the family of functions $f_{\epsilon}(x) = e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon + x^2}}$ is smooth and rapidly decreasing (hence Schwartz class). Therefore $\widehat{f_\epsilon}(\omega)$ is also Schwartz class, even though $f_\epsilon \to f$ uniformly as $\epsilon \to 0$ . Again, quite strange... We could have also created a compactly supported bump function, $\beta(x)$ , that is identically $1$ on some $\epsilon$ -neighborhood of $x=0$ . Then you can use $1-\beta(x/\epsilon)$ as a family of smooth cutoffs to eliminate the point of non-differentiability: $g_{\epsilon}(x) = (1-\beta(x/\epsilon))e^{-|x|}$ . This does the same thing as before, with $\widehat{g_{\epsilon}}(\omega)$ being Schwartz class for all $\epsilon > 0$ , with $g_{\epsilon} \to g$ as $\epsilon \to 0$ . And even if we go one level deeper and consider a function which is $C^1$ , just not smooth, things aren't any better. Consider the function $h(x) = x|x|e^{-x^2}$ . The exponential term, $e^{-x^2}$ , is a Gaussian which is pretty much as nice as it gets when it comes to Fourier transforms; and the other term, $x|x|$ , has a derivative equal to $2|x|$ and hence it is $C^1$ . But sure enough, $\widehat{h}(\omega)$ involves some polynomial terms and the Dawson function , and ends up being $O\left( \omega^{-3} \right)$ . Similar computations can be done for any function of the form $h_k(x) = x^k |x| e^{-x^2}$ , with $k\in \mathbb{N}$ , where each $h_k \in C^{k}(\mathbb{R})$ , and yet none of these have a Fourier transform that has rapidly decay. So clearly being $C^k$ and rapidly decreasing is still not very much better than simply being $C^0$ and rapidly decreasing; and certainly nowhere close to being as good as being smooth and rapidly decreasing. Again, I'm not disputing any of these facts, and these kinds of phenomena where sequences of ""nice"" functions converge to ""not nice"" functions are abundant in analysis. I'm just looking for some deeper understanding or insight (dare I say, intuition ) as to the role smoothness plays when it comes to Fourier transforms. This then would also beg the question of what role rapid decay has as well? How do these two unrelated ideas come together so perfectly for the Fourier transform? And is there analogous concepts when it comes to the more general Fourier transform on locally compact abelian groups ?","['fourier-transform', 'locally-compact-groups', 'functional-analysis']"

3507907,Complex Trigonometry using a Complex Triangle,"When using the trigonometric functions with real numbers we often use a right triangle to visualize and simplify certain calculations. The same can be done when using the trigonometric functions with complex numbers with the triangle shown below: In this triangle all the sides and angles are complex. Additionally, those sides and angles satisfy the following properties: $$
z_1+z_2=z_3=\frac{\pi}{2}\\
w_1^2+w_2^2=w_3^2\\
$$ All the complex trigonometric functions obey the expected SOHCAHTOA relations on this triangle, and the inverse functions behave as expected as well. In particular, deriving the inverse trigonometric functions is made very easy by using this approach. For example, if we are given that: $$\sin^{-1}u=-i\ln\left(iu+\sqrt{1-u^2}\right)$$ and we are asked to derive a similar formula for $\cos^{-1}u$ then we can simply draw a complex right triangle with $w_1=\sqrt{1-u^2}, w_2=u, w_3=1$ , from which it is immediately clear that: $$\cos^{-1}u=\sin^{-1}\left[\sqrt{1-u^2}\right]=-i\ln\left[i\sqrt{1-u^2}+\sqrt{1-\left[\sqrt{1-u^2}\right]^2}\right]\\
=-i\ln\left(u+i\sqrt{1-u^2}\right)$$ The only drawback with this approach is that the real lengths and angles of the triangle have no connection with the complex sides and angles. If anything, the shape of the triangle should just be treated as a visual mnemonic. My question is this: why have I never heard of this approach being used when dealing with trigonometric functions of complex variables?","['complex-analysis', 'trigonometry']"

3508010,Trivial subsigma algebra of the Borel algebra,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be the unit interval $[0,1]$ equipped with the Borel algebra and the Lebesgue measure (restricted to the Borel algebra). I am trying to verify whether $P$ is 0-1 on the following sub-sigma algebra: for each $x$ , let $A_x=\{y\in [0,1]: y-x\in\mathbb{Q}\}$ . Clearly each $A_x$ is countable and therefore Borel. Moreover $\mathcal{A}=\{A_x: x\in[0,1]\}$ is a partition. Let $\mathcal{G}\subset\mathcal{F}$ denote the collection of $\mathcal{A}$ -saturated sets (i.e.~ $\mathcal{G}=\{F\in\mathcal{F}: \forall x, A_x\subset F\vee A_x\subset F^c\}$ , equivalently the elements of $\mathcal{G}$ are borel sets that are unions of $A_x$ 's). It is easy to verify that $\mathcal{G}$ is in fact a sigma-algebra. I want to check if $P$ is 0-1 on $\mathcal{G}$ . I can't find a way to apply either the Kolmogorov 0-1, Herwitt-Savage 0-1 or the ergodic theorem, and don't know any other way to prove this (or perhaps it is false - but I don't know how to show that either). Any help would be greatly appreciated. I think I have a proof idea, but it relies on certain assumptions that I am not sure are true. So I put it here for scrutiny: Say a rational $q$ is an $n$ -ary rational if $q=\frac{k}{n^i}$ for some $n, i, k$ (e.g.~ $q$ is a dyadic rational if $q=\frac{k}{2^i}$ ). Let $A_x^{n}$ denote the set of $y\in[0,1]$ that differs from $x$ by an $n$ -ary rational. Clearly $\mathcal{A}^n=\{A_x^n:x\in[0,1]\}$ also forms a partition and $A_x=\bigcup_nA_x^n$ . Now let $\mathcal{G}_n$ denote the collection of $\mathcal{A}^n$ -saturated sets in $\mathcal{F}$ . We claim that $P$ is 0-1 on $\mathcal{G}_n$ for all $n$ . This is straightforward when $n=2$ : identify $[0,1]$ with the Cantor space, then $\mathcal{G}_n$ is the tail-sigma-field generated by infinite iid coin tosses. I think the same reasoning applies to $n>2$ . Suppose the reasoning above is cogent. Then let $A\in\mathcal{G}$ . Note that $A\in\mathcal{G}$ only if $A\in\mathcal{G}_n$ for all $n$ . Since $P$ is 0-1 on $\mathcal{G}_n$ , it follows that $P(A)\in\{0,1\}$ .","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"

3508167,"KKT multipliers and ""active"" and ""inactive"" constraints on the generalized Lagrangian $L$","The textbook Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, says the following in a section on constrained optimization : The inequality constraints are particularly interesting. We say that a constraint $h^{(i)}(\mathbf{x})$ is active if $h^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}^*) = 0$ . If a constraint is not active, then the solution to the problem found using that constraint would remain at least a local solution if that constraint were removed. It is possible that an inactive constraint excludes  other solutions. For example, a convex problem with an entire region of globally optimal points (a wide, flat region of equal cost) could have a subset of this region eliminated by constraints, or a nonconvex problem could have better local stationary points excluded by a constraint that is inactive at convergence. Yet the point found at convergence remains a stationary point whether or not the inactive constraints are included. Because an inactive $h^{(i)}$ has negative value, then the solution to $\min_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha, \alpha}}\ge 0} L(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha}})$ will have $\alpha_i = 0$ . We can thus observe  that at the solution, $\mathbf{\alpha} \odot \mathbf{h(x)} = \mathbf{0}$ . In other words, for all $i$ , we know that at least one of the constraints $\alpha_i \ge 0$ or $h^{(i)}(x) \le 0$ must be active at the solution. To gain some intuition for this idea, we can say that either the solution is on the boundary imposed by the inequality and we must use its KKT multiplier to influence the  solution to $\mathbf{x}$ , or the inequality has no influence on the solution and we represent this by zeroing out its KKT multiplier. Prior to this section, the authors define the aforementioned functions as follows: To define the Lagrangian, we first need to describe $\mathbb{S}$ in terms of equations and inequalities. We want a description of $\mathbb{S}$ in terms of $m$ functions $g^{(i)}$ and $n$ functions $h^{(j)}$ so that $\mathbb{S} = \{ \mathbf{x} | \forall i, g^{(i)}(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \ \text{and} \ \forall j, h^{(j)}(\mathbf{x}) \le 0 \}$ . The equations involving $g^{(i)}$ are called the equality constraints , and the inequalities involving $h^{(j)}$ are called the inequality constraints . So it seems that the $h^{(i)}$ being described here is the ""inactive"" constraint. Furthermore, when the authors say that, because an inactive $h^{(i)}$ has negative value, the solution to $\min_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha, \alpha}}\ge 0} L(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha}})$ will have $\alpha_i = 0$ , this is because, in the section prior to saying this, they introduce new variables $\lambda_i$ and $\alpha_j$ for each constraint (these are called KKT multipliers), and define the generalized Lagrangian as $$L(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha}}) = f(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_i \lambda_i g^{(i)} (\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{j} \alpha_j h^{(j)}(\mathbf{x})$$ So therefore, evidently, if we are calculating $\min_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}} \max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha, \alpha}}\ge 0} L(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{x}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\lambda}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha}})$ , then, in order to satisfy $\max_{\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\alpha, \alpha}}\ge 0}$ , we require $\alpha_j = 0$ , since, again, $h^{(j)} \le 0$ (that is, it is ""inactive""). But this section still leaves me unclear on a number of things: When the authors refer to ""convergence"" in this context, they're referring to convergence to the stationary point, right? Why is it the case that an ""inactive"" constraint potentially excludes other solutions? Is this just due to the fact that the values being considered during convergence are constrained to $h^{(j)}(\mathbf{x}) \le 0$ , and so we are not also considering the values $h^{(j)}(\mathbf{x}) \ge 0$ ? I'm not understanding the following explanation and the idea of how the KKT multipliers influence the solution: To gain some intuition for this idea, we can say that either the solution is on the boundary imposed by the inequality and we must use its KKT multiplier to influence the  solution to $\mathbf{x}$ , or the inequality has no influence on the solution and we represent this by zeroing out its KKT multiplier.

Let $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a manifold. Then the tangent space at $x \in M$ is defined in the following way: For some parametrization $ \phi: U \rightarrow V $ near $x$ , let $\phi_{0}$ be the Jacobian matrix of $\phi$ evaluated at $0$ , which can be seen as a linear transformation from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ .Then the tangent space of $M$ at $x$ is defined as $$T_{x}(M)= \phi_{0}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$$ I have always worked with the tangent space as being the set of derivations at a point.

3508910,Dissecting a hypercube into specific hypercubes,"The problem We define "" $m$ -cube"" as an $m$ -dimensional hypercube. ( $m=2$ is square, $m=3$ is cube, ...) $(\mathbf Q):$ Given a container $m$ -cube of integer side length $a$ , and $n$ many $m$ -cubes of integer side lengths $1\lt a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\lt a$ , determine if we can fit all of them into the container such that the remaining empty space is fully filled with unit $m$ -cubes. You can assume that the given lengths of sides are sorted: $a_1\ge a_2 \ge  \dots a_n \ge 2$ . I'm looking for references to known algorithms that can be applied here. Motivation: the problem "" For what natural n does there exist a cube composed of n cubes and more "" can be reduced to sets of $(\mathbf Q)$ problems. So far I know that if $m=1$ or $n\le 2^m$ , we can answer $(\mathbf Q)$ in $O(n)$ time. (See below.) Case $(n\in\mathbb N, m=1)$ and case $(n\le2^m,m\ge 2)$ Since $a$ -side $m$ -cube has at most $a^m$ unit cubes, we have the least necessary condition: $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^m\le a^m \tag{$\mathbf n_1$}$$ If $m=1$ , we have a $1$ -cube which is a segment. In this case, $(\mathbf n_1)$ is a sufficient condition. That is, if $m=1$ then $(\mathbf Q)$ can be answered true if and only if $(\mathbf n_1)$ holds. From now on, assume $m\ge 2$ . WLOG assume $a_{\text{max}}=a_1\ge a_2 \ge \dots \ge a_n\ge 2$ . It is not hard to consider placing $m$ -cubes in corners of the container, to conclude: $$ (\forall i\in\{2,3,\dots,n\})(a_i\le a-a_1) \tag{$\mathbf n_2$}$$ After placing the largest (side length $a_1$ ) $m$ -cube in the (side length $a$ ) container $m$ -cube, any next $m$ -cube can't be larger than $a-a_1-j$ where $j\ge 0$ is the minimal distance from the placed $m$ -cube and any of the sides of the container. To minimize $j$ (and maximize allowed space for next $m$ -cube), we place the $a_1$ into any of the $2^m$ corners of the container $m$ -cube. If $n\le 2^m$ , then $(\mathbf n_2)$ is a sufficient condition. (Place the $m$ -cubes in the corners). That is, If $n\le 2^m$ then $(\mathbf Q)\iff(\mathbf n_2)$ . From now on, we can assume $n\ge 2^m+1,m\ge 2$ . The question now is, how to continue with this analysis further? Can we find necessary and sufficient conditions for more general cases?","['reference-request', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'algorithms']"

3508940,Function being differentiable vs. derivative expression being undefined,"Here's my confusion: My teacher, as well as some online sources such as Khan Academy, seem to assume that the derivative expression being undefined at a point implies that the function being differentiated is not differentiable at that point. Consider, for example, $g(x)=x^{1/3}$ . The second derivative is $g''(x)=-2/9*x^{-5/3}$ . In this Khan Academy video , the speaker concludes that the second derivative doesn't exist at $x=0$ because if you plug zero into the $g''$ expression you end up dividing by zero. But why does that conclusion follow? How can we be sure the expression is defined wherever the function is twice differentiable? Along similar lines, when doing implicit differentiation in class, we were taught that a function $y$ fails to be differentiable when the expression we get for $dy/dx$ is undefined. For example, if $x^2+2xy+2y^2=1$ , then we found $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{(-2x-2y)}{(2x+4y)}$ . We were told that to find where $y$ fails to be differentiable, we should set $2x+4y = 0$ , because that is the denominator of our derivative expression and we can't divide by zero. But again, as asked above, why can we be certain that having the derivative expression undefined implies that $y$ isn't differentiable? Finally, I'll note that there's at least one example where I've noticed disconnect between where the expression is defined and where the derivative exists . That example is $f(x)=\ln(x)$ . That is obviously not differentiable for $x<0$ , yet the derivative expression, $f'(x)=1/x$ , is defined for $x<0$ (it's only undefined if $x=0$ ). How do we reconcile that with what I've written in the preceding paragraphs? I hope my question is clear. I can clarify if necessary - I realize it's a bit complicated and lengthy.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

Unfortunately, I'm not able to get the result via SVD which is why I created that question 3D Data $p_0 = (0|0|0)$ $p_1 = (-7|0|0)$ $p_2 = (3|-6|0)$ $p_3 = (7|-4|0)$ $p_4 = (3|2|0)$ $p_5 = (6|1|0)$ $p_6 = (4|7|0)$ 2D Data $p_0 = (700|288)$ $p_1 = (93|63)$ $p_2 = (293|868)$ $p_3 = (1207|998)$ $p_4 = (1218|309)$ $p_5 = (1540|502)$ $p_6 = (1679|128)$ Calculation General Formula $PH = \begin{bmatrix} -x_1 \quad -y_1 \quad -1 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad x_1x_1' \quad y_1x_1' \quad x_1' \\ 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad -x_1 \quad -y_1 \quad -1 \quad x_1y_1' \quad y_1y_1' \quad y_1' \\ -x_2 \quad -y_2 \quad -1 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad x_2x_2' \quad y_2x_2' \quad x_2' \\ 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad -x_2 \quad -y_2 \quad -1 \quad x_2y_2' \quad y_2y_2' \quad y_2' \\ -x_3 \quad -y_3 \quad -1 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad x_3x_3' \quad y_3x_3' \quad x_3' \\ 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad -x_3 \quad -y_3 \quad -1 \quad x_3y_3' \quad y_3y_3' \quad y_3' \\ -x_4 \quad -y_4 \quad -1 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad x_4x_4' \quad y_4x_4' \quad x_4' \\ 0 \quad 0 \quad 0 \quad -x_4 \quad -y_4 \quad -1 \quad x_4y_4' \quad y_4y_4' \quad y_4' \\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}h1 \\ h2 \\ h3 \\ h4 \\ h5 \\ h6 \\ h7 \\ h8 \\h9 \end{bmatrix} = 0$ Add new row to get a $9 \times9$ matrix $PH = \begin{bmatrix} -x_1 & -y_1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x_1x_1' & y_1x_1' & x_1' \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1 & -y_1 & -1 & x_1y_1' & y_1y_1' & y_1' \\ -x_2 & -y_2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x_2x_2' & y_2x_2' & x_2' \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_2 & -y_2 & -1 & x_2y_2' & y_2y_2' & y_2' \\ -x_3 & -y_3 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x_3x_3' & y_3x_3' & x_3' \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_3 & -y_3 & -1 & x_3y_3' & y_3y_3' & y_3' \\ -x_4 & -y_4 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & x_4x_4' & y_4x_4' & x_4' \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_4 & -y_4 & -1 & x_4y_4' & y_4y_4' & y_4' \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\ \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}h1 \\ h2 \\ h3 \\ h4 \\ h5 \\ h6 \\ h7 \\ h8 \\h9 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\1 \end{bmatrix}$ Fill in values $P = \displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}-93 & -63 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -651 & -441 & -7\\0 & 0 & 0 & -93 & -63 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\-293 & -868 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 879 & 2604 & 3\\0 & 0 & 0 & -293 & -868 & -1 & -1758 & -5208 & -6\\-1207 & -998 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 8449 & 6986 & 7\\0 & 0 & 0 & -1207 & -998 & -1 & -4828 & -3992 & -4\\-1218 & -309 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3654 & 927 & 3\\0 & 0 & 0 & -1218 & -309 & -1 & 2436 & 618 & 2\\0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]$ Invert matrix $P$ and multiply with homogeneous vector to get matrix $H$ $H = P ^{-1} * \displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\1\end{matrix}\right]$ Fill in and calculate result $H= \displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}\frac{13724393133269}{1982067999646851}\\\frac{28367198390048}{1982067999646851}\\- \frac{5924445050578537}{660689333215617}\\\frac{11075363038922}{1982067999646851}\\- \frac{29759444826748}{1982067999646851}\\\frac{281612087155126}{660689333215617}\\\frac{2748231707}{1982067999646851}\\\frac{1890176860316}{1982067999646851}\\1\end{matrix}\right]$ Convert to $3 \times 3$ matrix $H= \displaystyle \left[\begin{matrix}\frac{13724393133269}{1982067999646851} & \frac{28367198390048}{1982067999646851} & -

3509050,"Find a continuous, real valued function without maximum and show that a set is compact in $\ell^1$","I am working on following task: Let $$ \ell^1(\mathbb{R}) = \{ x=(x_k)_{k=1}^\infty : x_k \in \mathbb{R}, \|x\|=\sum_{k=1}^\infty |x_k| < \infty \}.$$ Fix $y \in \ell^1$ and define $$ B=\{x \in \ell^1: \|x\|\leq1\}$$ and $$ M = \{x\in \ell^1: |x_k|\leq |y_k|\}.$$ Find a continuous, real valued function on $\ell^1$ that does not have a largest value on $B$ and show that $M$ is a compact subset of $\ell^1$ . My first thought was that such a function doesn't exist, since $B$ is compact and a continous function will take its minimum and maximum value. But then I recognized that that $\ell^1$ is an infinite dimensional space, so the closed unit ball doesn't have to be compact anymore.
Do you have some good idea to define such a function? For the compactness of $M$ I thought about using the definition, that every sequence in $M$ has a convergent subsequence in $M$ . If I take a sequence $x^n$ in $M$ , then $|x^n_k| \leq |y_k|$ for every $k$ (coordinates) and $n$ (member of the sequence). But how can I construct a convergent subsequence out of $x^n$ ? Some hints or solutions would be really helpful.","['continuity', 'functional-analysis', 'compactness']"
3509227,Is $f(\sqrt{x}) + f(-\sqrt{x})$ always rational?,"Suppose that $f$ is a rational function over $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$ , or whatever field makes this easier to answer). Is $$\frac{f(\sqrt{x}) + f(-\sqrt{x})}{2}$$ always a rational function of $x$ ? This question is inspired by a sequence question. Given a sequence $a_n$ with a rational generating function, is it true that, say, $a_{2n}$ also has a rational generating function? If $f$ is the generating function for $a_n$ , then $(f(\sqrt{x}) + f(-\sqrt{x})) / 2$ is the generating function for $a_{2n}$ . As an example, take $f(x) = 1 / (1 - x)$ , which corresponds to the all-ones sequence $a_n = 1$ . Then $$\frac{f(\sqrt{x}) + f(-\sqrt{x})}{2} = \frac{1}{1 - x},$$ as we would expect. This specific case might be ""easy"" to answer (not for me), but when I first heard about this someone mumbled something about Galois theory and field extensions that I didn't understand.

3509277,A triangle whose only lattice points are exactly its vertices has area $1/2$. Help formalize my proof?,"Consider a triangle $ABC$ in the plane. Its vertices are all lattice points (their coordinates are integers.) Further, there are no other lattice points in this triangle, either on its boundary or interior. It can be shown in a number of ways that such a triangle has area $\frac{1}{2}$ . There are several questions on this site asking for proofs, but I have an idea for an argument that I haven't seen in the answers to those questions. I'm having a little trouble formalizing it, though, and I'm not entirely sure the idea can lead to a rigorous proof. My idea is this: Every triangle whose vertices are all lattice points necessarily has area of the form $\frac{n}{2}$ where $n$ is a positive integer (this would follow directly from the expression for the area of a triangle in terms of its vertices' coordinates.) If a triangle $ABC$ contains a lattice point $A'$ in its edge or interior, we can construct a new triangle $A'BC$ by replacing the vertex $A$ with $A'$ . Visually, it seems to me that such a triangle has strictly smaller area than $ABC$ does, and its vertices are also all lattice points, so its area is of the form $\frac{m}{2}$ with $0 < m < n$ . It should then follow immediately that any such $ABC$ has area greater than $\frac{1}{2}$ . It is easy to see that there are some lattice-point triangles having area $1/2$ , so the only lattice-point triangles having area $\frac{1}{2}$ are those that do not contain other lattice points. Something about this proof feels handwavy to me (in particular, I haven't justified that by replacing a vertex of a triangle with a point on its edge or in its interior, you obtain a strictly smaller triangle), but I think the basic outline is promising. Moreover, I've only established that any triangle containing lattice points has area $> 1/2$ , not that every triangle not containing lattice points has area $1/2$ .

3509327,Induction step is not clear in Bóna's proof that the generating function of the alternating runs has $-1$ as a root of a certain multiplicity,"I am reading the book Combinatorics of Permutations (2nd edition) by Miklós Bóna, and in $\S$ 1.2 Alternating Runs , he states and proves a lemma on page 29 whose proof I do not fully understand. Assume $n > 1$ . Let $p := p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_n$ be a permutation in $S_n$ . We say that $p$ changes direction at $i \in \left\{2,3,\ldots,n-1\right\}$ if either $p_{i-1} < p_i > p_{i+1}$ or $p_{i-1} > p_i < p_{i+1}$ . We say that $p$ has $k$ alternating runs if $p$ changes direction at $k-1$ points. Let $r(p)$ denote the number of alternating runs of $p$ . Let $G(n,k) := \lvert\{ p \in S_n : r(p) = k\}\rvert$ , that is, $G(n,k)$ equals the number of permutations in $S_n$ having $k$ alternating runs. Consider the generating function $$
G_n(x) := \sum_{p \in S_n} x^{r(p)} = \sum_{k = 1}^{n-1} G(n,k) x^k
$$ Observe that the coefficients of $G_n(x)$ are all even, because if $p \in S_n$ has $k$ alternating runs, then so does $p^c$ , the complement of $p$ , given by $p^c(i) := n + 1 - p(i)$ . One also empirically observes that $-1$ is a root of $G_n(x)$ with multiplicity $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1$ , by computing $G_n(x)$ for many small values of $n$ . Bóna gives a combinatorial proof that the second observation holds for all $n > 1$ , and this is essentially the content of the lemma on page 29. Some more definitions before stating it: Let $1 \leq j \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ and $p \in S_n$ . We say that $p$ is $j$ -half-ascending if the last $j$ disjoint pairs of elements in the sequence $p_1,p_2,\dotsc,p_n$ are ascending, that is, if $p_{n+1-2i} < p_{n+2-2i}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq j$ . For a $(j+1)$ -half-ascending permutation $p \in S_n$ , define $r_j(p)$ to be the number of alternating runs of the subsequence $p_1,p_2,\dotsc,p_{n-2j}$ , and $s_j(p)$ to be the number of descents of the subsequence $p_{n-2j},p_{n-2j+1},\dotsc,p_n$ (the number of descents of a sequence $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_k$ is the cardinality of the set $\{i \in [k-1] : u_i > u_{i+1}\}$ ). Define $t_j(p) := r_j(p) + s_j(p)$ , and define $$
G_{n,j}(x) := \sum_{p} x^{t_j(p)},
$$ where the sum is taken over all the $(j+1)$ -half-ascending permutations $p$ in $S_n$ . Now, we have the following lemma on page 29: LEMMA 1.41 For all $n > 1$ and $0 \leq j \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor -1$ , we have $$
\frac{G_n(x)}{2(1+x)^j} = G_{n,j}(x).
$$ The proof is purportedly by induction. The base cases are easy: this is how they go. Base case I: $j=0$ and $n \geq 2$ . A $1$ -half-ascending permutation $p \in S_n$ satisfies the single constraint $p_{n-1} < p_n$ . Clearly, $r_0(p) = r(p)$ and $s_0(p) = 0$ , so $t_0(p) = r(p)$ . Since $r(p) = r(p^c)$ , and for every $p \in S_n$ either $p$ or $p^c$ is $1$ -half-ascending, we see that $$
\frac{G_n(x)}{2} = G_{n,0}(x),
$$ as required. Base Case II: $j = 1$ and $n \geq 4$ . A similar argument as in the previous case shows that $$
\frac{G_n(x)}{2} = \sum_{p : p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}} x^{r(p)}.
$$ Let $I \colon S_n \to S_n$ be the involution defined by $I(p_1\dotsm p_{n-2}p_{n-1}p_n) := p_1\dotsm p_{n-2}p_n p_{n-1}$ , that is, $I$ swaps $p_{n-1}$ and $p_n$ . One can check that for every $p \in S_n$ such that $p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}$ , $r(p)$ and $r(I(p))$ differ by $1$ . Let $q \equiv q(p)$ be that permutation in the set $\{ p, I(p) \}$ with smaller number of alternating runs. Then, $$
\sum_{p : p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}} x^{r(p)} = \sum_{q(p)} \bigl(x^{r(q)} + x^{r(q)+1}\bigr) = (1+x) \sum_{q(p)} x^{r(q)}.
$$ Let $q' \equiv q'(p)$ be that permutation in the set $\{ p, I(p) \}$ which is $2$ -half-ascending. Then, it turns out that $r(q) = t_1(q')$ , so that $$
\sum_{q(p)} x^{r(q)} = \sum_{q'(p)} x^{t_1(q')} = G_{n,1}(x).
$$ Hence, $$
\frac{G_n(x)}{2(1+x)} = G_{n,1}(x),
$$ as required. Now, how does one check that $r(q) = t_1(q')$ ? Note that it suffices to check this in the case $n = 4$ , because it is only the last $4$ terms in the sequence $p_1,\dotsc,p_n$ that are really relevant here. Thus, one just writes down all $6$ pairs of elements of the form $(p,I(p))$ where $p \in S_4$ is $2$ -half-ascending, and checks that $t_1(p)$ equals the number of alternating runs of that permutation between $p$ and $I(p)$ which has smaller number of alternating runs. This completes the second base case. Induction Step. Now, this is what Bóna has to say regarding the induction step (on pages 29–30): Now let us assume that we know that the statement holds for $j-1$ and prove it for $j$ . Apply $I$ to the two rightmost entries of our permutations to get pairs as in the initial case, and apply the induction hypothesis to the leftmost $n-2$ elements. By the induction hypothesis, the string of the leftmost $n-2$ elements can be replaced by a $j$ -half-ascending $(n-2)$ -permutation, and the number of runs can be replaced by the $t_{j-1}$ -parameter. In particular, $p_{n-3} < p_{n-2}$ will hold, and therefore we can verify that our statement holds in both cases ( $p_{n-2} < p_{n-1}$ or $p_{n-2} > p_{n-1}$ ) exactly as we did in the proof of the initial case. $\blacksquare$ Quite frankly, this is completely confusing and I can find no interpretation of this paragraph that actually works. For example, what does . . .apply the induction hypothesis to the leftmost $n-2$ elements. . . mean? How does one apply the induction hypothesis to individual elements? This is just one of many points due to which the given outline for the inductive step does not go through, in my opinion. Can anyone help me find out how to fix the proof, or even exhibit how the inductive step works in the case $n = 6$ ?

While attempting a proof on my own, I discovered a method that seems right to me but does not appear anywhere as a standard proof. Please comment on the validity of this proof, since it is likely I messed up somewhere. Throughout the proof we consider elements belonging to a group $G$ . We attempt a proof by induction on the number of elements in the expression. The base cases of 1,2,3 are seen to be true trivially or by the associative property. Now assume that the value of any n-element expression is independent of how the expression is bracketed. (Induction Hypothesis) Now consider any $(n+1)$ -element expression given by $a_1\star a_2\star ... \star a_n\star a_{n+1}$ . All bracketings of this expression may be divided into $n$ types as follows (these types are not necessarily disjoint ): bracketings containing $(a_1\star a_2)$ bracketings containing $(a_2\star a_3)$ . . . n. bracketings containing $(a_n\star a_{n+1})$ Let $(a_i\star a_{i+1})$ = $a_{(i,i+1)}$ , which is also an element of $G$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$ ).
Now for any type $i$ considered above, the corresponding $(n+1)$ - element expression can be reduced to an $n$ - element expression by substituting $a_{(i,i+1)}$ instead of $(a_i\star a_{i+1})$ . Then by IH, all bracketings of this type evaluate to a bracketing- independent value which we shall call $A_i$ . It remains to show that $A_1 = A_2 = A_3 = .... = A_n$ . But note that for any $i$ , $A_i$ = $(..((a_1\star a_2)\star a_3)..\star a_{i-1}) \star ((a_{i}\star a_{i+1})\star a_{i+2})\star(..((a_{i+3}\star a_{i+4})\star a_{i+5})..\star a_{n+1})$ = $(..((a_1\star a_2)\star a_3)..\star a_{i-1}) \star (a_{i}\star( a_{i+1}\star a_{i+2}))\star(..((a_{i+3}\star a_{i+4})\star a_{i+5})..\star a_{n+1})$ = $A_{i+1}$ . So for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$ , $A_i$ = $A_{i+1}$ . This implies $A_1 = A_2 = A_3 = .... = A_n$ , as required. This proves the result for the case of $n+1$ .

3509716,Efficient algorithm to determine which of 2 sums of quantities infinitesimally close to 1 is greater,"Let $\gamma$ be infinitesimally close to 1 (or more precisely, let $\gamma=1-\epsilon$ and consider this problem for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ ). Suppose I have two quantities which consist of finite sums of powers of $\gamma$ , for example, $a=\gamma+\gamma^4$ and $b=\gamma^2+\gamma^3$ . Is there an efficient way to determine which of $a$ or $b$ is greater without doing a binomial expansion? (i.e. decide if $a-b>0$ ?) Obviously, if $a$ and $b$ consist of a different number of terms, then whichever has more terms is greater. In this case, however, they both have 2 terms. One straightforward way to decide which is bigger is to expand: $$ a=(1-\epsilon)+(1-\epsilon)^4 = (1-\epsilon)+(1-4\epsilon+6\epsilon^2-4\epsilon^3+\epsilon^4)=2-5\epsilon+6\epsilon^2-4\epsilon^3+\epsilon^4$$ $$b = (1-\epsilon)^2+(1-\epsilon)^3=(1-2\epsilon+\epsilon^2)+(1-3\epsilon+3\epsilon^2-\epsilon^3)=2-5\epsilon+4\epsilon^2-\epsilon^3$$ So for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ , we get $b<a$ since $4\epsilon^2<6\epsilon^2$ . However, ideally I'd like to implement this on a computer efficiently, and in particular, binomial coefficients can grow quite large and require arbitrary precision arithmetic if the array which decides whether the $i$ th power of $\gamma$ is present is large. I was hoping that there would be a straightforward, obvious way to just 'look' at them and decide which is bigger. One constraint I have is that for each $i$ , $\gamma^i$ appears in at most one of $a$ or $b$ with coefficient $0$ or $1$ . One result I discovered is that if we start with $\gamma$ and for the $n$ th power, add or subtract $\gamma^n$ to bring the current sum closer to $0$ , we get the Thue-Morse sequence with the signs. For example: We start with $\gamma$ . Since $\gamma>0$ , subtract $\gamma^2$ . Since $\gamma-\gamma^2>0$ , subtract $\gamma^3$ . Since $\gamma-\gamma^2-\gamma^3<0$ , add $\gamma^4$ etc. The sequence is $\gamma-\gamma^2-\gamma^3+\gamma^4-\gamma^5+\gamma^6+\gamma^7-\gamma^8-\dots$ . Since the Thue-Morse sequence is easy to compute, I was hoping this would give an easy way to generalize this to comparing arbitrary sums of powers of $\gamma$ by comparing them to the Thue-Morse sequence. Alternatively, a proof of the Thue-Morse property would be nice, and might give me some insight.","['computational-mathematics', 'discrete-mathematics', 'infinitesimals']"
3509769,Is set Dedekind continuous?,"The set is called Dedekind continuous when there is no way to make a $A||A'$ or $A)(A'$ cuts where: $A||A'$ cut means there is the biggest element in $A$ set and the lowest element in $A'$ set $A)(A'$ cut means there is no biggest element in $A$ and no lowest element in $A'$ We all know that $\mathbb{R}$ is Dedekind continuous. The question is whether the following subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is Dedekind continuous or not: $$ M = (-\infty; 2) \cup [3; +\infty) $$ It is obvious this set can't be ""geometry"" continuous since there is a gap between $2$ and $3$ but I can't find a way to make $A||A'$ or $A)(A'$ cuts to prove it is not Dedekind continuous.","['elementary-set-theory', 'continuity', 'real-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
3509803,Using the implies symbol in proofs,"Is it valid to use the implies symbol ( $\implies$ ) or the if and only if symbol ( $\iff$ ) in mathematical proofs to replace writing assumptions? For example, if I want to prove, $$\text{If } A \subseteq B, \text{ then } A \cup B = B$$ Can I write my proof as follows? Let A be a subset of B. $$
x \in A \cup B \\
\iff x \in A \vee x \in B \\
\implies x \in B \vee x \in B (\because x \in A \implies x \in B) \\
\iff x \in B \\
\therefore A \cup B \subseteq B \\
x \in B \\
\implies x \in B \vee x \in A \\
\iff x \in A \cup B \\
\therefore B \subseteq A \cup B \\
\therefore A \cup B = B

3509953,Are surjective sheaf morphisms locally surjective?,Let $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal G$ be sheaves of groups of some topological space $X$ and let $\varphi : \mathcal F \to \mathcal G$ be a surjective morphism. That means that for each $x \in X$ the induced group morphism $\varphi_x : \mathcal F_x \to \mathcal G_x$ is surjective. Does this imply that for each $x\in X$ there exists an open $U \subseteq X$ with $x \in U$ such that $\varphi_U : \mathcal F(U) \to \mathcal G(U)$ is surjective? I don't think so but would be glad to see an easy counter example.,"['group-theory', 'sheaf-theory']"
