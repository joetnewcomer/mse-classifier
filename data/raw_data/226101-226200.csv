The chapter is about continuity and it defines $$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$$ (for a function mapping a metric space $E$ into a metric space $F$ ) saying $a$ is a limit point of $E$ . I don't understand: for a function whose domain is $\mathbb R$ , does it mean that for $\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)$ we have ∞ being a limit point of $\mathbb R$ ?

4666735,Using an integral to generate rational approximations of $\pi$,"Let $$f(r)=\int_0^1\frac{x^r(1-x)^r}{1+x^2}dx.$$ One surprising fact is that $f(4)=\frac{22}{7}-\pi.$ This got me thinking.

Well, this is what I've found so far: $$\boxed{f(0)=\frac{\pi}{4}â‰ˆ0.785}$$ $$\boxed{f(4)=\frac{22}{7}-\piâ‰ˆ0.001}$$ $$\boxed{f(8)=4\pi-\frac{188684}{15015}â‰ˆ3.64Ã—10^{-6}}$$ $$\boxed{f(12)=\frac{431302721}{8580495}-16\piâ‰ˆ1.18Ã—10^{-8}}$$ $$\boxed{f(16)=64\pi-\frac{5930158704872}{29494189725}â‰ˆ4.00Ã—10^{-11}}$$ Let $k\in\{0,1,2,\ldots\}.$ It seems to me that $f(4k)=4^{k-1}((-1)^k\pi+(-1)^{k+1}R_k),$ where $R_k$ is some rational approximation of $\pi.$ We have: $$\boxed{R_0=0}$$ $$\boxed{R_1=\frac{22}{7}}$$ $$\boxed{R_2=\frac{188684}{15015Ã—4}}$$ $$\boxed{R_3=\frac{431302721}{8580495Ã—16}}$$ $$\boxed{R_4=\frac{5930158704872}{29494189725Ã—64}}$$ I have three conjectures at this point: $$\textbf{C1:}\lim_{r\to\infty}f(r)=0.$$ $$\textbf{C2:}\forall k\in\{0,1,2,\ldots\},f(4k)=4^{k-1}((-1)^k\pi+(-1)^{k+1}R_k),R_k\in\mathbb{Q}.$$ $$\textbf{C3:}\lim_{k\to\infty}R_k=\pi.$$ Clearly, $(\textbf{C1}\wedge\textbf{C2})\implies\textbf{C3}.$ How do we go about proving these conjectures?

4666776,Phase spaces for second order differential equations - Arnold's ODE,"this is my first post here, so please excuse me if I do anything wrong I'm a high school student, and my question is about phase planes, which I got interested in after learning about differential equations. In Arnold's ODE book, he introduces the notion of a phase plane here: This phase plane seems to be different from other vector fields I've seen, which has normally axes $x$ against $t$ , or $y$ against $x$ . It seems to be different because it is '2 dimensional' and that this case arises for second order differential equations. Gilbert Strang's course on YouTube also introduces this, but doesn't explicitly explain why the axes of the phase plane are $y'$ and $y$ . A comment in the video said that it is because 'any second order ODE can be transformed into a system of 2 first order ODEs'. My question is that I do not understand the process of defining the coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$ of the phase space to be the position and velocity, instead of maybe the velocity and time, or using a three dimensional vector field, with position velocity and time. I know that time is specific to this case, which is time-dependent, but is time somehow built into the solution to the differential equation? I am not sure where time fits into this and how we can interpret the phase space without time. It would be helpful enough to point me in any further reading I would have to do to understand this, instead of a full answer if possible. I have tried to look for an explanation which relates creating phase plots to transforming second order equations to a system of first order ones, but to no avail. Thanks very much to anyone who can help! References: What is ""Phase Space"" in differential equations and classical mechanics? What is the defininition of phase Space in simple terms?

4666781,Does Hessian of rank one mean curvature in one direction and flatness in the other,"I'm following a course on convex optimization by Stephen P. Boyd. https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:StanfordOnline+SOE-YCVX0001+1T2020/ My question is about Lecture 3 ( https://youtu.be/JrWSn5wW_Z0 ). Boyd gives a function: quadratic-over-linear : $f(x,y) = x^2/y,\: y>0$ The Hessian matrix of the function is: $$\nabla^2f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}2/y&&-2x/y^2\\-2x/y^2&&2x^2/y^3\end{bmatrix}=\frac{2}{y^3}\begin{bmatrix}y\\-x\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}y\\-x\end{bmatrix}^T$$ So  the Hessian matrix has rank one. Boyd says at https://youtu.be/JrWSn5wW_Z0?t=1527 : The fact that it's rank one tells you that at any point on that surface it's
sort of curving in one direction, but not the other.
Alright, so that's what it says. In one direction, it's flat.
In the other direction, it's got positive curvature. I don't see why it's true for any point. For example, $\nabla^2f(1,1)= \begin{bmatrix}2&&-2\\-2&&2\end{bmatrix}$ . So the function has curvature in both $x$ and $y$ direction. Maybe Boyd meant to say that this is true for any point $(x_0, y_0)$ where $\nabla f(x_0,y_0) = 0$ ?
In that case the line $x_0=0$ would represent the set of such points, and the Hessian matrix would be $\nabla^2f(0,y_0)= \begin{bmatrix}2/y_0&&0\\0&&0\end{bmatrix}$ . This would mean that the function has curvature only in $y$ direction. So, what am I missing here? Is the claim really true for any point? Is it true only for points where the gradient is zero? Is it true for any function in general?","['multivariable-calculus', 'convex-analysis', 'hessian-matrix']"
4666800,Upper bound for the norm of a matrix by using an upper bound on the entries,"Let $F:\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}^3$ be a function of class $C^1$ such that $$(x_1, x_2, x_3)\in \mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}\mapsto F_i(x_1, x_2, x_3)\in\mathbb{R}, \quad \forall i\in\{1, 2, 3\}.$$ As an exercise, I have to find an upper bound (better if as tight as possible) for $$\left\Vert\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}(y)\right)_{i, j=1, 2, 3}\right\Vert  $$ where the above notation refers to the norm of the matrix $\left(\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}(y)\right)_{i, j=1, 2, 3}$ as it is defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm (the norm defined through the supremum). $\textbf{EDIT:}$ By following the idea given in the answer by @kieransquared, I checked again all the computations.
The only information I have is that $$ \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}(y) \le\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{1}{\alpha^{\beta +1}} -\frac{y_i^2 (\beta +1)}{\gamma^{\beta +3}} &\hbox{ if } i=j\\[10pt]
\displaystyle -\frac{y_j^2 (\beta +1)}{\gamma^{\beta +3}} &\hbox{ if } i\neq j,
\end{cases}$$ where $a, \beta\ge 1$ , $\alpha,\gamma >0$ constants and $|x|$ denotes the euclidean norm of the vector $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ . Hence, by using the triangle inequality, it follows that $$ \left\vert\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}(y)\right\vert \le\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{1}{\alpha^{\beta +1}} +\frac{y_i^2 (\beta +1)}{\gamma^{\beta +3}} &\hbox{ if } i=j\\[10pt]
\displaystyle \frac{y_j^2 (\beta +1)}{\gamma^{\beta +3}} &\hbox{ if } i\neq j,

4666901,Suppose $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two $n$-dimensional convex polytopes. Does $\partial P_1 \subseteq\partial P_2$ imply that $P_1 = P_2$?,"Given two convex polytopes $P_1$ and $P_2$ with the same dimension, I want to know if the boundary of $P_1$ (denoted $\partial P_1$ ) being contained in the boundary of $P_2$ (denoted $\partial P_2$ ) is enough to conclude that $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the same polytope. From $\partial P_1 \subseteq\partial P_2$ we immediately have that $\mathcal V_1 \subseteq \mathcal V_2$ (where $\mathcal V_i$ is the vertex set of $P_i$ ), which also implies that $P_1 \subseteq P_2$ . My rough idea of how to proceed is as follows: Suppose that there exists $v^\dagger$ such that $v^\dagger \in \mathcal V_2 \setminus \mathcal V_1$ ; if there are many such $v^\dagger$ , pick it so that there exists a vertex, $v$ , adjacent to it (in $P_2$ ) such that $v \in \mathcal V_1$ . Now, there must be a vertex $v^*$ in $\mathcal V_1$ such that $v^*$ is adjacent to $v$ in $P_1$ but not in $P_2$ (not sure how to show this formally, but basically the idea is that in $P_2$ , $v^\dagger$ is ''in-between'' $v$ and $v^*$ ...). Then, the convex hull of $\{v,v^*\} \subseteq \partial P_1$ but $\{v,v^*\} \not\subseteq \partial P_2$ , a contradiction. Therefore, we have $\mathcal V_1 = \mathcal V_2$ , giving us that $P_1 = P_2$ . Appreciate any ideas about how to formalize the step of showing that such a $v^*$ must exist, or showing that the claim is false (or, if it is correct, an alternate proof!). I know that the $v^*$ existence step must necessarily leverage that the polytopes have the same dimension, but it's not clear to me how to do this exactly...","['analytic-geometry', 'polytopes', 'convex-hulls', 'convex-geometry', 'geometry']"
4666925,"If $f(x,t) = g(u)$, how do I relate $\iint{fdxdt}$ to $\int{gdu}$?","I'm learning about Fourier Transforms in the context of travelling waves on a dispersive medium, and my textbook sort of handwaves a simplification in which $$ \textbf{F}(k,\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,t)e^{-i(kx-\omega t)}dxdt $$ becomes $$ \textbf{F}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,0)e^{-ikx}dx $$ Which, in conjunction with a dispersion relation $\omega =\omega (k)$ , allows the Fourier series for the travelling wave to be expressed as a single integral with respect to k. In trying to wrap my head around the subtleties of why this works, I ran into a more general problem that I think is at the crux of my confusion: if $f(x,t)=g(u)$ where $u$ is a function of $x$ and $t$ , is there a way to relate $\iint{fdxdt}$ to $\int{gdu}$ ? Of course $du=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}dt$ , but I have no clue how to use that to turn a single integral into two. I was also having trouble finding anything about this online since I don't know if there's a name for this simplification. Many thanks in advance for any and all help. Edit: I've managed to grasp a intuitive understanding for the Fourier simplification, but I'm still confused on how to mathematically justify it. Essentially, if you have a formula for the waveform at a specific time, then you can do a spatial FT to get the wavenumbers k that comprise it. Then, if you know the dispersion relation, essentially knowing the wavespeed associated with each wavenumber, then you can imagine pushing all the component waves of the spatial FT at their associated wavespeed, giving $$ f(x,t)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \textbf{F}(k)e^{i(kx-\omega (k)t)}dk $$ With $\textbf{F}(k)$ being what I had written above. While I have a clear enough picture in my head as to why this works, I'm still having trouble justifying it algebraically.

4666964,Rudin's RCA The Hahn-Banach Theorem.,"There is the theorem: If $M$ is a subspace of a normed linear space $X$ and if $f$ is a bounded linear functional on $M$ , then $f$ can be extended to a bounded linear functional $F$ on $X$ so that $||F||$ $=$ $||f||$ . There is the proof: We first assume that $X$ is a real normed linear space and, consequently, that $f$ is a real-linear bounded functional on $M$ . If $||f||$ $=$ $0$ , the desired extension is $F$ $=$ $0$ . Omitting this case, there is no loss of generality in assuming that $||f||$ $=$ $1$ . Choose $x_0$ $\in$ $X$ , $x_0$ $\notin$ $M$ , and let $M_1$ be the vector space spanned by $M$ and $x_0$ . Then $M_1$ consists of all vectors of the form $x$ $+$ $\lambda x_0$ , where $x$ $\in$ $M$ and $\lambda$ is a real scalar. If we define $f_1(x + \lambda x_0)$ $=$ $f(x)$ $+$ $\lambda \alpha$ , where $\alpha$ is any fixed real number, it is trivial to verify that an extension of $f$ to a linear functional on $M_1$ is obtained. The problem is to choose $\alpha$ so that the extended functional still has norm $1$ . This will be the case provided that $|f(x) + \lambda \alpha |$ $\leq$ $|| x + \lambda x_0||$ ( $x$ $\in$ $M$ , $\lambda$ real). Replace $x$ by $-\lambda x$ and divide both sides of $|f(x) + \lambda \alpha |$ $\leq$ $|| x + \lambda x_0||$ by $|\lambda|$ . The requirement is then that $|f(x) - \alpha|$ $\leq$ $||x-x_0||$ ( $x$ $\in$ $M$ ), i.e., that $A_x$ $\leq$ $\alpha$ $\leq$ $B_x$ for all $x$ $\in$ $M$ , where $A_x$ $=$ $f(x)$ $-$ $||x-x_0||$ and $B_x$ $=$ $f(x)$ $+$ $||x-x_0||$ . There exists such an $\alpha$ if and only if all the intervals $[A_x,B_x]$ have a common point, i.e., if and only if $A_x$ $\leq$ $B_y$ for all $x$ and $y$ $\in$ $M$ . I have two questions : $(1)$ -   How is discussing the case where $||f||$ $=$ $1$ enough for the proof of the  theorem? $(2)$ -  How do we conclude that There exists such an $\alpha$ if and only if all the intervals $[A_x,B_x]$ have a common point, i.e., if and only if $A_x$ $\leq$ $B_y$ ?

=\ \frac1{2(4n+1)}+ \frac1{2(4n)}+ \frac1{4(4n-1)}-\frac14I_{n-1}}
\end{align} Let’s start with the easy one. $$
\begin{aligned}I_2& =\int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \frac{1}{\left[1+\tan \left(\frac{\pi}{4}-x\right)\right]^2} d x \\
& =\frac{1}{4} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}(1+\tan x)^2 d x \\
& =\frac{1}{4} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left(1+2 \tan x+\tan ^2 x\right) d x \\

\end{aligned}
$$ To proceed, I tried  further with the same method of evaluating $I_2$ by putting $x\mapsto \frac{\pi}{4} -x$ which transforms $$
\begin{aligned}
I_n & =\frac{1}{2^n} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}(1+\tan x)^n d x \\

\end{aligned}
$$ Using the reduction formula for $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \tan ^{2 k} x d x,$ we can continue our evaluation on $I_n$ as below: $$
\begin{aligned}
 I_3=-\frac{\pi}{8}+\frac{3}{4},\quad  I_4=\frac{2}{3} -\frac{\pi}{8}, \quad  I_5=\frac{5}{12}-\frac{\pi}{16},

$$ For $n=6$ , letting $x\mapsto \frac{\pi}{4}-x  $ transforms the integral into $$

& =\frac{1}{64} \int_{-\frac{\pi}{4}}^{\frac{\pi}{4}}(1+\tan x)^6 d x\\\\

$$ Expanding the integrand into $3$ odd and $4$ even functions simplifies it into $$
\begin{aligned}I_6&=\frac{1}{32} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left(1 +\tan ^6 x +15 \tan ^2 x+15 \tan ^4 x\right) d x\\&= \frac{1}{32} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\left(1-\tan ^2 x+\tan ^4 x+15 \tan ^2 x\right) d(\tan x)\\& =\frac{1}{32}\left[\tan x+\frac{14 \tan ^3 x}{3}+\frac{\tan ^5 x}{5}\right]_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}}\\&=\frac{11}{60}  \end{aligned}
$$ When evaluating $I_6$ , I found the symmetry of the binomial coefficients in expansion, I can group the corresponding terms together and found that $I_n$ has no $\pi$ when $n\equiv 2 \quad  \pmod 4$ , i.e. $$I_{4n+2}\in Q.$$ Proof: $$

4667183,Can a Jordan curve contain measure-theoretic interior points of the domain it bounds?,"Let $I$ be an interval, and $\gamma:I\to \mathbb{R}^2$ a Jordan curve. By the Jordan--Schoenflies Theorem $\gamma(I)$ splits up $\mathbb{R}^2$ in two connected pieces, that is, $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus \gamma(I)$ is made by exactly two connected components, a bounded one, $V$ , and an unbounded one $U$ , that have as boundary the image of the curve $\gamma(I)$ . The bounded one is homeomorphic to the unit disk. I know that are bad-behaved curves, à la Knopp--Osgood, such that their image has Hausdorff dimension $2$ (if you prefer, a slightly stronger thing is to say it has positive $2$ -dimensional Lebesgue measure).

We say that a point $p\in \mathbb{R}^2$ belongs to $V^{(1)}$ if $$\lim_{r\to 0^+} \frac{|B_r(p)\cap V|}{\pi r^2} = 1.$$ Can $\gamma(I)$ contain any point that belongs to the measure-theoretic interior of $V$ ?

I first tried induction but doesn't seem to work well. Special cases can be proved like $n=2,3$ using brute force but I am trying to find a simpler proof. Some observations: Define the function $f_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)=\prod_{1\leq i,j\leq n}\frac{1+x_ix_j}{1-x_ix_j}$ for $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in(-1,1)^n$ . Note that if $a_i\geq0$ for all $i$ then all the terms in the product are at least $1$ and hence $(1)$ is trivially true. So, is it possible to prove the following? $$f_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\geq1\iff f_n(-x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\geq1$$ , if yes then by symmetry we can repeat this process and make all $a_i\geq0$ . Also, using Induction we can do the following: Base case $n=1$ is trivial. Assuming for some $n\geq1$ , we see that $$f_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)f_n(-x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)=f_{n-1}(x_2,\ldots,x_n)^2\geq1$$ and hence at least one of the following is true: $f_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\geq1$ or $f_n(-x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)\geq1$ . The case of equality As @RiverLi pointed out and @MartinR wrote an answer, it is evident that equality holds if and only if $$\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2k-1}\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{2k-1}\right)^2=0$$ The partial sums form an increasing sequence of nonnegative reals. So, the series can evaluate to zero if and only if $$\sum_{i=1}^na_i^{2k-1}=0,k\geq1$$ which is a separate and interesting problem and is discussed here.","['contest-math', 'algebra-precalculus', 'inequality', 'real-analysis']"

In total, 1000 people will be choosen. Me and 4 of my friends have joined to the draw. So we have 5 people in. I wonder, what should be my approach to calculate what is the probability that at least one of us will be choosen? I mean, it looks like each have 1000/10000 = 0.1 probability to be choosen. But I cannot simply add 0.1 5 times because then if we were 10 people, result would be 100% probability that at least one of us will be choosen by this method, however, it is not true of course. Also, another thing bothers me is the fact that the second one to be choosen will not be 0.1, instead 999/9999, and 3rd one 998/9998, and so on. So I cannot say that each will have 0.1 probability. If the numbers were smaller, the difference in probabilities would be very noticable. As seen, I need a bit of enlightment about how to approach such a problem. By the way, my best solution to this is 1 - (1 - 0.1)^5 Which is 1 - the joint probability of all of us not being choosen, which I think should give the probability that at least one of us will be chosen.

4667272,How to compute the number of tuples such that no element appears exactly once?,"I'm trying to compute the number of $t$ -tuples such that no element appears exactly once in the tuple, and each element can take values from $[N]=\left\{0,\ldots,N-1\right\}$ . Let us denote $u_{N, t}$ this quantity. For instance, for $t=4$ and $N=128$ , $(1, 4, 1, 4)$ is a valid tuple (each element within the tuple has at least one other copy) but $(1, 4, 1, 1)$ is not ( $4$ is alone). It is fairly simple to see that: $u(N, 1)=0$ , since every tuple will contain a single element, it can't have any other copies of it $u(N, 2)=N$ , since every valid tuple can be written as $(x, x)$ , with $x\in[N]$ $u(N, 3)=N$ , since every valid tuple can be written as $(x, x, x)$ My reasoning for the general case is the following: $u_{N, t}$ is equal to $N^t$ minus the number of tuples such that at least one element is unique. For $k\geqslant1$ , we thus choose the positions of the unique elements, for which we have $\binom{t}{k}$ choices We have to choose the values for these elements, for which we have $\frac{N!}{(N-k)!}$ choices. We finally have to choose the values for the other $N-k$ elements. We know that they cannot contain a single unique element, thus we have $u_{N-k,t-k}$ choices. All in all, we have: $$u_{N, t}=N^t-\sum_{k=1}^t\binom{t}{k}\frac{N!}{(N-k)!}u_{N-k, t-k}$$ However: I'm not sure this formula is correct: for $t=1$ and $t=2$ there are some corner cases that make it most likely wrong (we don't get $0$ and $N$ respectively), but it might work for $t\geqslant3$ For large values of $N$ , this can be quite tedious to compute (dynamic programming?)

There should be a pretty elegant+fast way to do it from this prototype, no?
But difficulties I came across are: We can not just show that these induce isomorphisms of graded rings, because they don't. This is for one thing because we need two charts (see second point), but also because we need cancellation. For example, applying our maps $\mathbb{P}_k^1 \to \Proj k[x,y,z]/I \to \mathbb{P}_k^1$ with the first chart yields $(\lambda : \mu) \mapsto (2\lambda \mu : 2 \mu^2)$ . This is the identity, but to see it we need to cancel by $2\mu$ , and in particular it doesn't define an isomorphism of rings (also not localized ones, no?). To define the morphism to $\mathbb{P}^1$ , we need two charts. (I think it's not possible to do it with only one chart, no?) So the proof would need to use at least some localizations.

Below are some inference rules and axioms I'm using: Axiom: Let $\Gamma$ be a list of formulas, $\phi ,\psi$ be two formulas e $x,y$ be two variables. We assume that $\forall x\phi \vdash \phi $ . Moreover, if $y$ is not a bounded variable of $\phi$ , then $\forall x\phi \vdash \phi [y/x]$ Suppose that $x$ isn't a free variable of $\psi$ . If $\Gamma,\phi \vdash \psi$ , then $\Gamma,\exists x\phi \vdash \psi $ . I want to emphasize that I'm NOT using the existential instantiation . Let $\phi$ be a formula. We denote $\color{red}{\forall \overline{x}(\phi (\overline{x}))}:=\forall x\big(\exists X(x\in X)\Rightarrow \phi (x)\big)$ $\color{red}{\exists {\overline x}(\phi (\overline{x}))}:=\exists x\big(\exists X(x\in X)\wedge \phi (x)\big)$ . Axiom of Pairing: We assume that $$\vdash \forall \overline{x}\forall \overline{y}\exists
 \overline{z}\forall w\big(w\in \overline{z}\Leftrightarrow
 (w=\overline{x}\vee w=\overline{y})\big)$$ Below is what I did: Definition: Let $x,y,Z$ be three classes. We say that $x$ and $y$ are the only elements of $Z$ if $\vdash \forall w\big(w\in Z\Leftrightarrow (w=x\vee w=y)\big)$ Proposition: Let $x,y,Z_1,Z_2$ be four classes. If $x$ and $y$ are the only elements of $Z_1$ , then $(Z_2=Z_1)\equiv \forall w\big(w\in Z_2\Leftrightarrow (w=x\vee w=y)\big)$ . Because of the previous proposition, if $x$ and $y$ are the only elements of a class $Z$ , then we can denote $Z$ by $\color{red}{\{x,y\}}$ . Using the axiom of pairing and the previous notations, I want to prove that, given any two sets $x$ and $y$ , we have $\vdash \exists \overline{z}(\overline{z}=\{x,y\})$ . That is, I want to prove that if $\vdash \exists X(x\in X)$ and $\vdash \exists Y(y\in Y)$ then $\vdash \exists z\big(\exists Z(z\in Z)\wedge z=\{x,y\}\big)$ . I was able to prove that $$\vdash \exists z\big(\exists Z(z\in Z)\wedge \forall w(w\in z\Leftrightarrow (w=x\vee w=y))\big)\color{red}{(1)}.$$ So, to prove what I want, I just need to prove that $\vdash \forall w\big(w\in z\Leftrightarrow (w=x\vee w=y)\big)$ and use the previous proposition.

4667435,PI Controller - Integral term is causing instability,"I am simulating the height of the reservoir in a hydro power plant using Matlab, without Simulink. The radial gates of the power plant are used to control the height of the water in the reservoir. This is done by implementing a PI controller on the radial gates. First, I am trying to let things work with only one radial gate. The flow into the reservoir is chosen to be $$Q_{in} = 400 \,\,m^3/s. \qquad \qquad (1)$$ The output flow through a radial gate is given by $$Q_{out} = \frac{dV}{dt} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{2\cdot g \cdot H_g} \qquad \qquad (2)$$ where $$H_g = H - \frac{D}{2} \qquad \qquad (3)$$ . Rewriting eq. (2) with respect to (3) gives $$Q_{out} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{2g (H - \frac{D}{2})} \\
= C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot L \cdot \sqrt{g} \cdot \sqrt{2H-D}. \qquad \qquad (4)$$ Grouping all the constants as $C_1 = L \cdot \sqrt{g}$ gives $$Q_{out} = C_g(D) \cdot D \cdot C_1 \cdot \sqrt{2H-D} \qquad \qquad (5)$$ Eq. (5) includes following variables and constants: $C_g(D)$ is a function dependent on the gate opening $D$ . $D$ is the gate opening. It's interval is 0 - 8.7 meters. $C_1$ consists of $L$ which is the width of the gate and gravity $g$ . $H$ is the height of the reservoir, calculated from the edge of the lower part of the
gate where $D = 0$ . Furthermore, I am using a PI controller to control the height $H$ . I am using a for-loop in Matlab to simulate this problem. The discrete PI controller I use is calculated as follows. The error in Matlab is calculated by $$error(1,i) = H(1,i) - H_d(1,i)$$ where $H$ is the height and $H_d$ is the reference value or the set point. The height of the reservoir should always be at $116 m$ above sea level.
In the program, I subtract the lower edge of the radial gate, where $D = 0m$ , which is $H_{edge} = 110m$ , so the radial gate is placed very high above sea level. I also choose the initial height in the simulation to be $H_{initial} = 115.8 m$ , therefore, $$H(1,1) = H_{initial} - H_{edge} = 115.8 - 110 = 5.8m \\
H_d(1,1) = H_{d} - H_{edge} = 116 - 110 = 6m.$$ This gives an initial error of $error = -0.2m$ . Next thing I do is to calculate the $P$ and the $I$ terms: $$PI\_P(1,i) = k_p \cdot error(1,i) \\
PI\_I(1,i) = (\frac{k_i}{T_i}) \cdot (PI\_I(1,i-1) + 0.5 \cdot (error(1,i) + error(1,i-1))\cdot dt) - intWindup(1,i)$$ The integral term is actually calculated in the program as if i == 1
        PI_I(1,i) = ((ki/Ti)*error(1,i)*dt) - intWindup(1,i);
    else
        PI_I(1,i) = ((ki/Ti)*(PI_I(1,i-1) + 0.5*(error(1,i) + error(1,i-1))*dt)) - intWindup(1,i);
    end The controller output is then calculated as the sum of the two terms: $$
PI\_u(1,i) = PI\_P(1,i) + PI\_I(1,i)
$$ Since the radial gate can only vary between 0m up to 8.7m, I used a integral windup method called ""backwards calculation"" so that the integrator will not ""windup"". This is shown in the image below: Next thing I do is calculate the saturation $$u\_sat(1,i)  = CheckSaturation(PI\_u(1,i),Dmax,Dmin)$$ The function I wrote is given below function u_sat = CheckSaturation(u,gateMax,gateMin)
% Controller saturation check

    if u >= gateMax
        u_sat = gateMax;
    elseif u <= gateMin
        u_sat = gateMin;
    else
        u_sat = u;
    end
end After this, I calculate the integral windup as $$intWindup(1,i+1) = intWindupBackCalculation(PI\_u(1,i),u\_sat(1,i),k\_lim)$$ where $k\_lim = 1$ . The function I wrote is given by function val = intWindupBackCalculation(u,u_sat,k_lim)
    diff = u - u_sat;
    val = diff * k_lim;
end Now finally, I update the model of the reservoir with the following code Cg1(1,i)     = Cg_D(D1(1,i),Dmin,Dmax);


    % The physical system
    Qout_gate1(1,i)  = Cg1(1,i) * C1 * D1(1,i) * sqrt(2*H(1,i) - D1(1,i));
    Qout(1,i)        = Qout_gate1(1,i) + Qout_m;
    H_dot(1,i)      = (1/A(1,i)) * (Qin(1,i) - Qout(1,i));
    H(1,i+1)        = H(1,i) + 0.5 * (H_dot(1,i) + H_dot(1,i+1)) * dt; This is simply calculation of eq. (2) from above, $Qout\_m = 0$ is the flow through the machines which is excluded in the calculations. The differential equation used to calculate the change of height is $$
\dot H = \frac{1}{A} (Q_{in} - Q_{out})
$$ then in the last line of the code, I use discrete integral to calculate the height. My question starts now . Below is a plot where I choose $k_p = 40$ and $k_i = 0.1$ $H$ is the change of height per second $H_d$ is the desired height, or the reference level, 116m $D1$ is the radial gate opening in meters error is simply the error, the blue line, while the integral windup is the red line.
it is also possible to see the proportional and integral gains in the legend. Qin is the red line and Qout is the blue line $PI\_P$ is the proportional term of the controller $PI\_I$ is the integral term of the controller In these figures above, it can be seen that the controller tries to keep the water height at 116m but there is this settling error, I think it's related to slowness of the integral term. It can also be seen that the radial gates opens up and it tries to regulate the water heigt. The error can be seen as very small related to the integral windup, but the error is there and it's not always zero. The flow in vs. flow out starts to be equal slowly. On the last figure, it can be clearly seen that the proportional term and the integral term is working. Now I choose $k_p = 40$ again, but the integral gain $k_i = 1$ In the figures above, the settling error is much smaller now and the response is much faster. The integrator is doing much more now, but not enough. I want the water level to be at 116m above sea level with only +/- 5cm. In real life, this system is very slow. The reservoir is huge, its area is $A = 3.8 \cdot 1000^2 \, \, m^2$ or $3.8 \,\, km^2$ . Now I want to increase the integral gain, and go above 1. So I choose $k_p = 40$ and $k_i = 2$ . In the figures above, it can clearly be seen that everything is very slow now which is not acceptable. Now I increase the integral term to $k_i = 5$ and everything goes unstable and crashes as you can see in the figures below. My question is:
What can I do about this problem? Do you have any idea of what I'm doing wrong or what I could do better? The integrator is being a little bit of problem for me and I thing it's a bit strange that the system crashes. The whole code is below: t0      = 0.0;           % [s] Initial time

4667438,Finding the distance from a point a distance $z$ above the center of a square to any point on the edge,"I was working on an electrostatics problem that I thought I was doing correctly. However, upon reading the solution I see I was not. I will post my attempt and the solution below and then ask a few (math pertinent) questions about both my attempt and the solution provided. I would greatly appreciate any help in understanding this problem. Thanks! Problem Statement Find the electric field a distance $z$ above the center of a square loop (side length $a$ ) carrying uniform line charge $\lambda$ . My attempt Well, first I knew that the $x$ and $y$ components would cancel due to symmetry so that only leaves the $z$ component. For the $z$ component itself I noted that there are $4$ line segments of equal length (hence equal charge) and so we could calculate the electric field due to one segment then just multiply it by $4$ (since each contribution would be pointing in the positive $z$ direction). Doing so yielded $$E_z = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda dx}{R^2}\sin\theta \hat{z} = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda dx}{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2}^2)}\frac{z}{\sqrt{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2}} \hat{z} = \frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}\int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} \frac{\lambda z dx}{(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \hat{z} = \frac{\lambda z}{\pi\epsilon_0(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}[x]\vert^{\frac{a}{2}}_{-\frac{a}{2}} = \frac{\lambda z a}{\pi\epsilon_0(z^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$ Where the distance from the center of an edge to the point $P$ is given by $R = \sqrt{z^2+ (\frac{a}{2})^2}$ and I implicitly multiplied by $4$ from the start by writing $\frac{1}{\pi\epsilon_0}$ Provided Solution They note the distance from $P$ to the center of the edge is also $R = \sqrt{z^2+ (\frac{a}{2})^2}$ and that the electric field due to one edge is then $$E_1 = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{\lambda a}{\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4}}\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{a^2}{4}}}$$ Hence the total vertical contribution to the electric field is found by multiplying by $4\sin\theta = 4\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 \frac{a^2}{4}}}$ which yields $$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{4\lambda az}{(z^2 + \frac{a^2}{4})\sqrt{z^2 + \frac{a^2}{2}}}$$ My questions I would just like help seeing where they found the expression for the field contribution for one segment. In particular the expression for the distance between the point $P$ and the source charge. I feel like maybe it comes about from integrating with $x$ -dependence in the denominator. It feels a bit ""wrong"" to not have any $x$ -dependence in my expression for the distance since the distance will change as we integrate along the line charge. The only way I can think about incorporating this is: for every small increment moved on the $x$ axis, we would create a right triangle (in the xy plane) with opposite and adjacent sides defined by the distance from the center of the square in the plane (static), $\frac{a}{2}$ , and the distance we've moved along the $x$ -axis from $0$ (varying) such that the hypotenuse of that triangle in the xy-plane would then become the xy-component of the $3D$ triangle used to calculate the distance from the point $P$ to a point on the edge. But that seems quite cumbersome. Any help in understanding where their expression for the distance came from and/or how to account for varying distance as we move along the line charge will be greatly appreciated.","['physics', 'trigonometry', 'electromagnetism', 'vectors']"

But this means that $\cos A = \pm \sqrt{1 – \sin^2 A}$ . However this implies that there are exactly two cosine values we are looking for. Is this correct? Moreover, I found that it is usual that when I define a trigonometric equation, say $\sin A = 0.5$ , then according to my algebra, there are exactly 2 values for $\cos A$ , exactly 2 values for $\sin 2A$ , and exactly 4 values for $\sin \frac A 2$ . Is this correct? I ask because I have never been taught this. Thank you in advance.","['algebra-precalculus', 'trigonometry']"

and then multiplying in the $1/n$ , the resulting rational functions are of the form: $1/(n+i)$ where the $i$ is the running index $i =1,2,3,\ldots$ . At first when I evaluated this as $n\to\infty$ ,
Realized it summed in a way that was not a nice number, it looked like the logarithm of a number you can say based on the expression. I now think that this sum/integral may Diverge due to looking like a harmonic series, but that running index that I call $i$ and that $n$ is a positive integer, that eventually you take to infinity, is a key thing. But trying to take this and seeing it as a Riemann sum and hence grouping the limit and Sigma sign to get the integral representation is where I am having difficulty seeing this.

The exercise is to prove $\operatorname{Pic}(\widehat{X})\rightarrow \operatorname{Pic}(Y)$ is an isomorphism. The hint is to use Exercise II.9.6, Exercise III.4.6, and Exercise III.5.5. Let me explain the crux of each part that I understand so far. For II.9.6,  the main point of the application is that $\operatorname{Pic}(\widehat{X})\cong \varprojlim_n \operatorname{Pic}(\widehat{X})(X_n)$ where $X_n$ is the scheme $(\widehat{X},\mathcal{O}_{\widehat{X}}/\mathfrak{I}^n)$ where $\mathfrak{I}$ is the ideal of definition to this formal scheme. In other words, $X_n$ is precisely $(Y,\mathcal{O}_X/\mathscr{I}^n_Y)$ for $\mathscr{I}_Y$ the ideal sheaf of $Y$ .  The only thing one needs to check is that the inverse system of global sections groups is Mittag-Leffler and this should easy enough due to a Noetherian hypothesis. The next part is to study the maps $\operatorname{Pic}(X_{n+1})\rightarrow \operatorname{Pic}(X_n)$ . These induced maps clearly exist and these Picard groups can be identified with $H^1$ of their unit sheaves. This leads to the next hint -- I take a short exact sequence $$
0\rightarrow \mathscr{I}_Y^n/\mathscr{I}_Y^{n+1}\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X_{n+1}}^*\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{X_{n}}^*\rightarrow 0
$$ which exists for each $n$ . More importantly, Exercise III.4.6 give rise to an exact sequence of abelian groups $$
\dots \rightarrow H^1(X,\mathscr{I}_Y^n/\mathscr{I}^{n+1}_Y)\rightarrow \operatorname{Pic}(X_{n+1})\rightarrow\operatorname{Pic}(X_{n})\rightarrow H^2(X,\mathscr{I}^{n}_Y/\mathscr{I}^{n+1}_Y)\rightarrow\dots 
$$ Now my thought would be that the last hint (Exercise III.5.5) should be applicable to this case to get some cohomology to vanish. However, the hypothesis that $N\geq 4$ is needed to show that $H^2(Y,\mathscr{I}^n,\mathscr{I}^{n+1})$ is always vanishing. In this case, we always have a surjective map $\operatorname{Pic}(X_{n+1})\rightarrow \operatorname{Pic}(X_n)$ for all $n\geq 1$ . And thereby I get a surjection for the desired map above. Crux of the Post / Question: How do we get injectivity? In general, I do not think we can get $H^1(\mathscr{I}^n/\mathscr{I}^{n+1})$ to vanish so I am stuck...","['algebraic-geometry', 'picard-group', 'commutative-algebra']"
4667801,Milne's definition of component group,"I am trying to understand the following definition from Milne's Algebraic Groups. Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $k$ and let $k^s$ be the separable closure of $k$ . Let $\pi_0(G)$ be the etale $k$ -scheme of connected components of $G$ and let $G\to \pi_0(G)$ be the canonical morphism of algebraic schemes. Taking the $k^s$ points of this morphism, one gets $G(k^s)\to \pi_0(G_{k^s})$ . Milne then claims that because the identity component $G^\circ$ is normal in $G$ , then there exists a unique group structure on $\pi_0(G_{k^s})$ such that the map $G(k^s)\to \pi_0(G_{k^s})$ is a group homomorphism respecting the Galois action, which would then make $\pi_0(G)$ an etale group scheme over $k$ . Does this mean that the map $G(k^s)\to \pi_0(G_{k^s})$ is a surjection?  And the fibres of this map are the connected components of $G(k^s)$ (topology induced from $G_{k^s}$ ) and $G^\circ (k^s)$ is the connected component of the identity in $G(k^s)$ ? If so, why are these true? I know that the map $G_{k^s}\to \pi_0(G_{k^s})$ is surjective, the fibres are the connected components of $G_{k^s}$ . I am not sure of the situation when $G_{k^s}$ is replaced by $G(k^s)$ . Could $G(k^s)$ be empty?

If the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \lvert g_n \rvert$ converges uniformly on $S$ ,
then the product $\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1+g_n)$ converges absolutely
and uniformly on $S$ . Furthermore, if $f(z)=\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}
 (1+g_n(z)), z\in S$ , then $f(z)=0$ iff $1+g_n(z)=0$ for some $n\in
 \mathbb N$ . Is the bounded condition redundant? The proof never makes use of it, in fact, uniform convergence of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |g_n|$ implies the boundedness of $g_n$ 's after a certain stage. Here's how it can be show: Let $\sigma_n (x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} |g_k(z)|$ . Since $\sigma_n$ converges uniformly, it is uniformly Cauchy ( see here ). Thus, there is some $K \in \mathbb N$ such that for every $m,n \ge K$ , we have that $|\sigma_{m} (x) - \sigma_{n} (x)| < 1$ . The result is now immediate by choosing $m=n+1$ for each $n \ge N$ .

4668045,What is the definition of a fiber of a vector bundle in algebraic geometry?,"I am learning the variations of Hodge structure, yet getting stuck at the very first beginning. Let $S$ be a projective nonsingular variety over $\mathbb{C}$ . I have seen that a variation of Hodge structure of weight $k$ on $S$ is the data A $\mathbb{Q}$ -local system $V$ , A decreasing separated exhaustive filtration $\{F^p\mathcal{V}\}_{p \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of holomorphic subbundles of $\mathcal{V} := V \otimes_{\underline{\mathbb{Q}}} \mathcal{O}_S$ such that for any $s \in S$ , the fiber $(V_s, F^pV_s)$ is a Hodge structure of weight $k$ and the canonical flat connection $\nabla$ satisfies the Griffith transversality. Question 1 : I am quite confused on the meaning of the "" fiber "" $(V_s, F^pV_s)$ . Could someone tell me the definition or provide a reference on what it means? As I understand it, a $\mathbb{Q}$ -local system $V$ is a locally constant sheaf of finite dimensional $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space. (I guess the dimensions locally are constant since $S$ is irreducible? Am I right?) I have been searching, and guessing that it might be $V_s := \mathcal{V}_s \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_{S,s}} \kappa(s)$ , where $\kappa(s)$ is the residue field of $s \in S$ , and similar for $F^p \mathcal{V}$ . Yet trying to be a Hodge structure, it has to be a $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space , but I cannot see why it is a $\mathbb{Q}$ -vector space. Moreover, Question 2 : what does the subbundle in the definition mean? And what does people mean by saying a ""holomorphic bundle""? As far as I can see, $\mathcal{V}$ is a locally free $\mathcal{O}_S$ -module of finite rank since locally it looks like $\mathbb{Q}^{\oplus N} \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathcal{O}_S \cong \mathcal{O}_S^{\oplus n}$ if we ignore the sheafification. (I am a little uncertain on this, since I have heard people saying that it is coherent, yet seldomly they say it is locally free.) So does the ""subbundle"" mean a sub- $\mathcal{O}_S$ -module that is still locally free?

4668051,Boundary conditions for weight function in weak form of an ODE or PDE,"I am really quite confused by how to pick a weight function's boundary conditions when evaluating the weak form of a differential equation. For example, given this ODE in the domain $0<x<1$ : $$u'''' + \frac{2}{x} u''' = 0$$ where $u(0) = u(1) = 0$ (Dirichlet BCs) and $u'(0) = u'(1) = 0$ (Neumann BCs), we pick a weight function $w(x)$ with the exact same Dirichlet and Neumann BCs , i.e. $w(0) = w(1) = w'(0) = w'(1) = 0$ , such that the boundary terms from subsequent IBP all vanish . However, when given this ODE in the domain $-1<x<1$ : $$xu''+2u'+2u = 0$$ with $u(1) = 0$ and $u(-1) = -2$ , we instead pick an arbitrary weight function such that $w(1) = w(-1) = 0$ ( not the same as the Dirichlet BCs of $u$ ) such that the boundary term from the subsequent IBP vanishes . Lastly, given Poisson's equation (a PDE): $$- \nabla^2u = f$$ with $$
\begin{aligned}
u=0 & \text { on } S_g, \\
\nabla u \cdot \boldsymbol{n}=h & \text { on } S_h,
\end{aligned}
$$ where $S_g$ and $S_h$ cover the entire boundary but do not overlap, the weight function we pick is 0 on $S_g$ (i.e. same Dirichlet BC but not the same Neumann BC ). This leaves us with the following weak form: $$
\int_V \nabla w \cdot \nabla u d V=\int_V w f d V+\int_{S_h} w h d S 
$$ where now the boundary term from IBP hasn't fully vanished (since we only picked $w=0$ on $S_g$ and not $S$ entirely). So I can't seem to figure out how to pick the boundary conditions of the weight function $w$ . E.g. in the case of the two ODEs I described, we pick the BCs of $w$ such that the boundary terms from IBP vanish (i.e. are equal to 0). Whereas with the PDE, the weight function we pick has boundary conditions such that the boundary term (surface integral) doesn't vanish. Is there a different approach to ODEs and PDEs? I would very much appreciate someone describing the general rules to follow with regards to the boundary conditions of $w$ .","['boundary-value-problem', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"

$ On the left is an example of a Word Ladder puzzle, invented (allegedly) by Lewis Carroll. One possible solution is on the right. The aim is to place a valid word in each row that is the same as the one preceding it except for one letter change. There are four words to fill in, so there are five letter changes between the start and end: at least one  additional letter must be introduced (the L in line 3 of my example.) I got to wondering how many possible solutions a given puzzle may have. Puzzles vary in this because of the restriction that all words must be valid, but if we use numbers instead of words that restriction disappears. Furthermore, in the word problem all eight of the given letters are different, but in my digital version I want to allow duplicates. So I am attempting to calculate the number of ways that one $4$ -digit number may be changed into another, changing one digit at a time, such that all the $4$ -digit numbers are different, and five changes are made (so over six lines). Leading $0$ 's and duplicate digits are allowed. First case and a solution The easiest case to enumerate is where none of the digits in the final row are in the same position in the starting row (e.g. changing $1234$ into $5678$ or changing $1234$ into $4321$ ). Four of the five digit changes are ""fixed"" in that once a digit is placed in its correct position in the final row it can't be changed. The other change I call ""free"" in that it doesn't appear in that position in the final row, so any valid digit will do. Here is an example using numbers: \begin{array}{ll}
1234 & \text{ Start}\\
\hline
5234 & 5 \text{ is fixed}\\
5634 & 6 \text{ is fixed}\\
5639 & 9 \text{ is free}\\
5679 & 7 \text{ is fixed}\\
\hline
5678 & 8 \text{ is fixed}
\end{array} The four fixed digits can appear in any order, and so these lines contribute a factor of $4!$ to the total. Which leaves the line containing the free digit. The number of possibilities for this line depends on when it is introduced: as more of the fixed digits are put in position, there are fewer places for the free digit to go. Although all 10 digits are theoretically available, each line must be different to the one(s) preceding it (i.e. one digit must change each time), and the free digit must not be the same as the digit in the same position in the final line (or it wouldn't be free). So only eight digits are available. The possibilities of what can happen where are: \begin{array}{clcc}
\text{Line}^1 & \text{Positions available} & \text{Possible lines}\\
\hline
2 & 4 & 32\\
3 & 3 & 24\\
4 & 2 & 16\\
5 & 1 & \phantom{0}8
\end{array} $^1$ i.e. the line in which the free digit is introduced. So the line containing the free digit can appear in $32+24+16+8 = 80$ ways.
Putting all this together, there are $24 \cdot 80 = 1920$ possible ways to complete each game. Other cases The next case is where one of the target digits is already in position, e.g. changing $1234$ into $1678$ . There are two cases here: i) force the target digit already in position to change. Another line then has to be used up to change it back again, so there is room for only one free digit. ii) do not change the target digit already in position. The problem becomes one of changing the other three digits over five lines, so two free digits are required. There are $\binom42 = 6$ ways in which they can be introduced (the final change must be fixed, not free). This gives six sub-cases of varying complexity. As above, the number of possibilities depends on when the free digits come in. I shan't take up time and space describing them here. The remaining cases (changing $1234$ into $1278$ (up to three free digits) and changing $1234$ into $1238$ (up to four free digits)) have increasing complexity. My question Is there an easier way to enumerate all this? Maybe consider the whole problem in one go rather than considering all these cases? Or a different way to divide into cases that makes for easier computation?","['recreational-mathematics', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics']"

If the integral inequality $\left|\int_{a}^{b}{f(x)\,dx}\right|\leq\int_{a}^{b}{|f(x)|\, dx}$ is used you can double the integral and use $\frac{\pi}{2}$ as the bound instead, and then use Jordan’s inequality. But the Estimation lemma follows from the integral inequality, so it must still be possible to bound the expression.

If I prescribe data at, say, $t = 1$ , then I can solve backwards in time: if $u(x, 1) = P_1f(x) = e^x$ or $u(x, 1) = x^2$ then respectively the solution is $u(x, 0) = f(x) = e^{-t}e^x$ or $u(x, 0) = x^2 - 2$ . Even if $u$ has very rapid growth at infinity, e.g. $u(x, 1) = e^{\alpha x^2}$ with $\alpha > 0$ , we can solve to find $f(x) = \sqrt{1+4\alpha}e^{\alpha x^2/(1 + 4\alpha)}$ . Formally, I know the solution should be $$e^{-\Delta}u(x, 1) = \sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}\Delta^k u(x, 1)$$ which, e.g. for polynomials, is a finite sum and, e.g. for exponentials (and probably the Gaussian too), is a convergent infinite sum. My question is: is there a class of functions (to which these non $L^2(\mathbb R)$ examples belong) for which this inversion/backwards heat equation makes sense and has nice estimates? For instance, if $u \in L^2(\gamma)$ where $\gamma$ is the standard Gaussian measure, we can write $u$ as an infinite sum of $u_n = \sum_{i=0}^\infty a_iH_i$ of Hermite polynomials (being an orthonormal base for $L^2(\gamma)$ ), and with enough decay on the $(a_i)$ the formal sum $f_n = e^{-\Delta}u_n$ converges to some $f \in L^2(\gamma)$ and it has the expected behaviour (that is, $P_1f = u$ ). But in doing so I lose (or do not know how to recover) statements about smoothness (which I expect is important since the heat kernel is smoothing) or even continuity. I have an inkling this question is also related to the nature of the error term (based off a paper [""A well posed problem for the backward heat equation"" by Miranker) in the expansion $$e^{-\Delta}u = u - \Delta u + \frac{1}{2}\Delta^2 u - \cdots$$ and I suspect the answer is that the question is ""well-posed"" if $u(x, 1) \leq Ce^{\alpha x}$ has at most exponential growth based on some simple examples for which the error $|e^{-\Delta u} - u| \leq C(1 + |\Delta u|)$ is roughly controlled by the first term. But I do not know if this problem is no longer well-posed if I introduce some pathological behaviour, e.g. by adding a fast oscillation like $u(x, 1) = e^x + x^2\sin^2(x^2)$ and if I need some extra conditions to prohibit this.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'heat-equation', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations']"

Hence $W ∈ 𝒫(A) ∪ 𝒫(B)$ . Assume $W ∈ 𝒫(A)$ . Then $W ⊆ A$ , so $x,y ∈ A$ . But $y ∉ A$ , so $W ∉ 𝒫(A)$ . Then $W ∈ 𝒫(B)$ , but then $x,y ∈ B$ , in particular $x ∈ B$ .

Ergo, $A ⊆ B$ or $B ⊆ A$ . I am suspicious of the step where I create a set $W = \lbrace x,y\rbrace$ . It seems a bit odd, to be able to create a set out of the blue, especially since $W$ is not arbitrary, it includes $x$ and $y$ . While I can see that $x$ and $y$ must exist, I don't see why they must be in the same set.

\int_0^\infty r g(r) J_1(qr) \, \mathrm{d}r =
\frac{2q}{\alpha^2} \left(  e^{-q} - e^{-Q}\right) \, ,

4668965,"Hints on showing that the sequence $\frac{1}{\#S_n}\sum_{l\in S_n}\mu\circ f^{-l},S_n\subset\mathbb{N}$ converges to $f$-invariant probability measure","Let $X$ be a metric space and $\mu$ be any probability measure on $X$ . Suppose that $f:X\to X$ is a continuous $\mu$ -measurable function and that $(S_n)_n$ is a sequence of subsets of the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ such that $\# S_n\to\infty,n\to\infty$ for the counting measure $\#$ . Define the map $\alpha_n(B) := \frac{1}{\# S_n}\sum_{l\in S_n}\mu(f^{-l}(B))$ for $B\subset X$ . It is then not hard to see that $\alpha_n$ is a probability measure on $X$ . Suppose then that $(n_k)_k$ is a subsequence of indices such that the subsequence $(\alpha_{n_k})_k$ converges in weak* topology to a probability measure $\alpha$ over $X$ , i.e. for any bounded continuous function $g:X\to\mathbb{R}$ we have $$\lim_{k\to\infty}\left|\int_Xg(y)d\alpha_{n_k}(y) - \int_X g(y)d\alpha(y)\right| = 0$$ where $$\int_Xg(y)d\alpha_{n_k}(y) = \frac{1}{\# S_{n_k}}\sum_{l\in S_{n_k}}\int_X(g\circ f^l)(y)d\mu(y)$$ as one can verify easily. ( Extra assumption: ) Take it as granted that if $f:X\to X$ is a continuous map then its pushforward map $f_*\mu(B) := \mu(f^{-1}(B)), B\subset X$ is continuous in weak* topology. I.e. if $\mu_n\to\mu$ in weak* as $n\to\infty$ then $\lim_{n\to\infty}f_*(\mu_n) = f_*\mu$ . ( Problem: ) I want to show that the prior limit measure $\alpha$ is $f$ -invariant, that for any $\alpha$ measurable subset $B\subset X$ we have $\alpha(B) = \alpha(f^{-1}(B))$ . ( Solution attempt/thoughts: ) Let $g:X\to \mathbb{R}$ be a fixed bounded and continuous function. By continuity of $f_*$ , $$f_*\alpha = f_*\left(\lim_{k\to\infty}\alpha_{n_k}\right) = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{1}{\# S_{n_k}}\sum_{l\in S_{n_k}}\mu\circ f^{-l - 1}$$ Therefore I would want to conclude that the difference $$I := \left|\frac{1}{\# S_{n_k}}\sum_{l\in S_{n_k}}\int_X(g\circ f^{l})(y) - (g\circ f^{l+1})(y)d\mu(y)\right|$$ can be made arbitrarily small after some sufficiently large $k$ . But since nothing guarantees that $l\in S_n\implies l+1\in S_n$ I have no idea how to relate these two quantities of the integrand. One could use triangle inequality and the fact that $\alpha_{n_k}$ s are probability measures to show that $$\left|\int_X(g\circ f^{l}) - (g\circ f^{l+1})(y)(y)d\mu(y)\right|\leq 2\sup_{y\in X}\left|g(y)\right|$$ for any $l\in S_n$ . But without additional information you would get this same bound for every summand occurring in $I$ and so the averaging is lost. What to do? I am not necessarily looking for a full-blown answer, but I'll appreciate any help/hints that you might be able to give.

4669015,Why is span defined as the linear combination with *finite* terms?,"I understand that, for a vector space $V$ with scalar field $K$ , the linear span of a family of vectors $S\subseteq V$ is usually defined as $$ \mathrm{sp}(S):=\left\{ \sum_{i=1}^k a_iv_i \mid k\in \mathbb{N},  a_i \in K, v_i\in S\right\} $$ In words: the span is the set of finite linear combinations of the vectors in $S$ . My question is about the motivation for defining the span to be a finite linear combination. Is there some uncomfortable conclusions  that would result from using a definition like $$ \mathrm{sp}(S):= \left\{ \sum_{v\in S} a_v v \mid a_v \in K \right\}$$ I suspect that this has something to do with preserving important structures of $S$ in the span of $S$ (perhaps topological structures?), but I have no concrete examples.","['motivation', 'topological-vector-spaces', 'definition', 'linear-algebra']"

false = λ xy. y
nil = λ x. x

I initially thought that I could define isempty as (λ x. x True ???) since nil evaluates to true . However, the resulting list from a non-empty list would be in the form (True x y) , which makes it unclear what to do when neither true nor false can be assigned to x and y .

4669121,Transformation of a vector field on $\mathbb{R}^2$ into one on the complex plane,"To gain a better understanding of vector fields and their flow computation, I wanted to experiment with a coordinate transformation: real coordinate in $\mathbb{R}^2$ <-> polar coordinates <-> complex plane. I have no problem with polar coordinates, but I got really confused, about how to deal with the transformation into the complex plane. I have chosen a simple vector field that describes a counterclockwise circular movement: $$ V = -y \partial_x + x \partial_y. $$ Given a starting point $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ , we know that there exist an integral curve $\phi \colon (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \to \mathbb{R}^2$ for some $\epsilon >0$ . It also holds that $$ \phi'(t) = \phi_1'(t) \partial_x + \phi_2'(t) \partial_y = V_{\phi(t)}. $$ So, to find $\phi$ , we need to solve the following system of ODEs: $$\phi_1'(t) = - \phi_2(t),$$ $$\phi_2'(t) = \phi_1(t).$$ A solution for a given initial problem is $$ \phi(t) = (x_0 \cos t - y_0 \sin t, x_0 \sin t + y_0 \cos t) \in \mathbb{R}^2.$$ If we transform this solution into complex numbers, we get that $\phi(t) = (x_0 + i y_0) e^{it} =: z_0  e^{it}$ . I find this form much easier to deal with, so I asked myself, how could I skip all this sine-cosine-computations, in such a way that I just need to solve something like $$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \phi(t) = i \phi(t).$$ As in the case of the polar coordinate transformation, I started with the transformation of my vector field. Somehow I ended up on the Wiki page reading about the Wirtinger derivative (never heard about it before) and managed to transform my vector field to $$ V = i (z \frac{\partial}{\partial z} - \bar{z} \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar{z}}).$$ After thinking a lot about this new form of the vector field and the result that I wanted to achieve with the complex exponential function, I understood that I have no idea how these two thoughts connect. I have a feeling that I try to combine apples with chairs. I do not know how to get to the point, where I can compare the components of the vector field and the velocity of the curve $\phi$ as I did it in the example above. Or in general, I don't really understand, how to find a flow for this complex vector field. I also don't understand, why I have two ""components"" ( $\partial_z$ and $\partial_\bar{z}$ ). I have thought that I will get a vector field in the form of $V = i z \partial_z$ , in my head, this would somehow connect to the solution that I have.

You have to split an odd number N of distinct objects into three different groups such that the number of objects in each group is an odd number. In how many ways can this be done? The blog goes into a combinatorial solution, giving an answer of $\frac{3^N-3}{4}$ . My question is: Is there an elegant reason why it is almost exactly a quarter of the possible distributions that work? More interestingly, is there a simpler argument for why it is exactly the number it is? As an example of what I'm looking for, for the easier question of how many ways there are to split an even number of distinct items into two groups with an even number of items, you can have a given item (item A, say), and for every selection where A is in the first group, there is one for which it is in the second group (just by moving it from group 1 to group 2). Since exactly one of those possibilities has an even number in each group, exactly half of the possible selections will work. Therefore the total number of ways is $2^{N-1}$ .
