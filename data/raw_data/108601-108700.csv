1560820,Conjecture about natural number satisfying $ m(n)^k+1\space\mid\space n^{2k}+1 $,"Let $m(n)$ be the greatest proper divisor of $n$. Is there any number $n≥2$ not of the form $p$ or $p^3$ for $p$ prime that satisfies
$$

1560894,Numbers whose powers are almost integers,"Some real numbers $\alpha$ have the property that their powers get ever closer to being integers -- more precisely, that
$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} \alpha^n-[\alpha^n] = 0 $$
where $[\cdot]$ is the round-to-nearest-integer function. This is trivially the case when $\alpha$ is itself an integer as well as when $|\alpha|<1$. But there are also other numbers with this property, such as $\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}$ (the golden ratio), $2+\sqrt3$, or $\frac{5+\sqrt{13}}2$. (The trick for each of these is that $\alpha^n+\beta^n$ solves a second-order integer recurrence, where $|\beta|<1$). Just to be sure this is not trivial, there numbers without this property, such as $\sqrt k$ for any nonsquare integer $k$. Is there a name for this property? Or a general theory of such numbers? Are there nontrivial ones that are not quadratic over $\mathbb Q$?","['number-theory', 'recreational-mathematics', 'field-theory', 'exponentiation']"

I would expect that for large $t$, the resulting measure on the unitary group approaches Haar measure -- is that right? Is there a simple heuristic argument showing that the limiting distribution is unitary-translation-invariant? I imagine that some much larger class of distributions on the Lie algebra might also yield the Haar measure under exponentiation for large $t$?   (Perhaps for other Lie groups / Lie algebras as well?) And if so, I'm also curious which distribution converges most quickly to Haar measure (for some fixed normalization of the size of $H$).","['probability-limit-theorems', 'probability-theory', 'random-matrices', 'lie-groups']"

1560964,Map Laplacian in terms of covariant derivatives,"I stumbled upon the following definition: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a manifold, $g_{ij}$, $h_{ij}$ be two Riemannian metrics on $\mathcal{M}$, $\psi : \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ be a twice differentiable map, $C_1$, $C_2$ be two charts on $\mathcal{M}$, $\Psi := C_2 \circ \psi \circ C_1^{-1}$. The map Laplacian $\Delta_{g,h}$ is defined by $$ (C_2 \circ
 (\Delta_{g,h} \psi) \circ C_1^{-1})^q := g^{ij}\left( \partial_i
 \partial_j \Psi^q 
 -  \Gamma(g)^k_{ij} \, \partial_k \Psi^q
 + (\Gamma(h)^q_{mn} \circ \Psi) \, \partial_i \Psi^m \, \partial_j \Psi^n \right) . $$ Basically, my question is how to make sense of the above beast, but since this is probably too broad, I would like to narrow it down to: can the above formula be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives? What I got so far: I recognise the term $\partial_i  \partial_j \Psi^q -  \Gamma(g)^k_{ij}\, \partial_k \Psi^q = \nabla_i \nabla_j \Psi^q$ as the second covariant derivative of $\Psi^q$ such that $g^{ij} \nabla_i \nabla_j \Psi^q = \nabla^i \nabla_j \Psi^q$ can be interpreted as the Laplacian of $\Psi^q$. Since $\Psi^q$ depends on the chart $C_2$, I also expect there to be some term to correct for that, which is probably the last one, but I cannot make that last statement any more precise. Update: Another question would be whether it is possible to give a physical intuition for this operator. For example, if $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}^3$, the map Laplacian becomes the vector Laplacian appearing in the Navier-Stokes equation where it describes the friction in the fluid (diffusion of momentum). This intuition does not generalise to the situation at hand, however, because $\psi$ is a map from the manifold onto itself, not from the tangent space (which is $T\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}^3 = \mathcal{M}$ for $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}^3$) onto itself.","['tensors', 'differential-geometry']"

1561036,$p$-Splittable Integers,"Let $p$ be a positive integer.  For each nonnegative integer $k$ , write $[k]$ for the set $\{0,1,2,\ldots,k\}$ .  Also, we define $[-1]:=\emptyset$ .  We say that an integer $k\geq -1$ is $p$ -splittable if there is a partition of $[k]$ into $p$ subsets $A_1$ , $A_2$ , $\ldots$ , $A_p$ such that $\sum_{x\in A_1}\,x=\sum_{x\in A_2}\,x=\ldots=\sum_{x\in A_p}\,x$ (i.e., these sets have the same sum).  Such a partition $\left\{A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_p\right\}$ is called a $p$ -splitting of $[k]$ . What are all $p$ -splittable integers for a given $p$ ? How many $p$ -splittings of $[k]$ are there for each of these available $k$ 's?  If the exact number of $p$ -splittings of $[k]$ is not easily computable, then what is the asymptotic answer? Clearly, $k=-1$ and $k=0$ are $p$ -splittable.  We can also ignore the trivial case $p=1$ .  We know that, if $p=2$ , then all $p$ -splittable numbers are of the forms $4t-1$ and $4t$ , where $t$ is a nonnegative integer.  If $p$ is an odd prime, then all $p$ -splittable numbers are integers of the forms $tp-1$ and $tp$ , where $t\in\{0,2,3,4,\ldots\}$ . For $p=2$ , we can show that the number of $2$ -splittings of a $2$ -splittable integer $k$ is given by the coefficient of $x^{\frac{k(k+1)}{4}}$ in the expansion of $\prod_{r=1}^k\,\left(1+x^r\right)$ .  For example, if $k=3$ , there are two $2$ -splittings of $[3]$ , namely, $\big\{\{0,1,2\},\{3\}\big\}$ and $\big\{\{1,2\},\{0,3\}\big\}$ , whereas $$\prod_{r=1}^3\,\left(1+x^r\right)=1+x+x^2+2x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6$$ whose coefficient of $x^{\frac{k(k+1)}{4}}=x^3$ is also $2$ .  Similarly, there are $2$ , $8$ , and $14$ $2$ -spittings of $[k]$ for $k=4$ , $k=7$ , and $k=8$ , respectively.  I do not know if there is any closed form for this coefficient for an arbitrary $2$ -splittable $k$ . I conjecture the following: (1) If $p$ is odd, then, for any $j\in\{-1,0,1,2,\ldots,p-2\}$ such that $p\mid j(j+1)$ , every integer of the form $tp+j$ , where $t\in\{2,3,4,\ldots\}$ , is $p$ -splittable, and nothing else (except $-1$ and $0$ ) is $p$ -splittable. (2) If $p$ is even, then, for any $j\in\{-1,0,1,2,\ldots,2p-2\}$ such that $2p\mid j(j+1)$ , every integer of the form $2tp+j$ , where $t$ is a positive integer, is $p$ -splittable, and nothing else (except $-1$ and $0$ ) is $p$ -splittable. This conjecture is true, at least, if $p$ is a prime power (where $j=-1$ and $j=0$ are the only possible choices of $j$ ).  If you can show that (1) holds for $t=2$ and for $t=3$ , and that (2) holds for $t=1$ , then you are done.  It is worth noting that, if $k$ is $p$ -splittable, then $k+2p$ is $p$ -splittable. Inspiration: Partitioning $\{1,\cdots,k\}$ into $p$ subsets with equal sums P.S. I include $k=0$ and $k=-1$ for the sake of completeness.  There is nothing subtle about these numbers.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'prime-numbers', 'combinatorial-number-theory']"

1561106,What does it mean for a sequence of sheaves to be exact,"Let $F, G, H$ be sheaves on a topological space $X$, and let $$F \xrightarrow{\alpha} G \xrightarrow{\beta} H $$ be morphisms of sheaves.  By definition,  $\textrm{Ker } \beta$ is the subpresheaf $U \mapsto \textrm{Ker}(\beta(U))$ of $G$, and it is in fact a sheaf.  If $O$ is the subpresheaf of $G$ given by $U \mapsto \textrm{Image}(\alpha(U))$, then $\textrm{Im } \alpha$ is defined to be any sheafification of $O$.  Let $\theta: O \rightarrow \textrm{Im } \alpha$ be a morphism of presheaves such that the pair $(\textrm{Im } \alpha, \theta)$ satisfies the universal property for sheafification. I've seen the definition that the sequence above is exact if $\textrm{Ker } \beta = \textrm{Im } \alpha$, but I'm confused as to what this really means.  I am aware that the sheafification $(\textrm{Im } \alpha, \theta)$ may be chosen to literally be a subsheaf of $G$ (from the fact that $\theta$ preserves an isomorphism on the stalks, and a morphism of sheaves is injective on the sections if and only if it is injective on the stalks).  But even so, any sheafification of $O$ which is a subsheaf of $G$ need not be uniquely determined (as far as I can see).

1561162,Continuous comparison between two Finsler norms?,"Let $(E,F_1)$ be a Finsler vector bundle over a manifold $M$. (See precise definition below).
Let $F_2$ be another Finsler function (norm) on $E$. For any $p \in M \, , \, F_1|_{E_p}:E_p \to \mathbb{R}$ is a norm on a finite dimensional vector space. Hence the corresponding unit sphere $\mathbb{S^p_1}=\{v_p \in E_p |F_1(v_p)=1 \}$ is compact. So $F_2$ attains a minimium on $\mathbb{S^p_1}$. Thus we obtain a function $m:M \to \mathbb{R}$ via $m(p) = \min\{F_2(v_p) | v_p \in \mathbb{S^p_1}\}$ Question: Is $m$ always continuous? Remarks: (1) I am quite sure $m$ is not smooth in general. For example, if $E=TM$ and $F_i$ are the Finsler norms induces by two Riemannian metric $g_1,g_2$, then a calculation here shows that $m(p)=\min \lambda(G)$ where $G$ is the component matrix $g_{ij}$ of one metric w.r.t an orthonormal frame of the other. (2) We cannot always choose a continuous minimizing section $s:M \to E$  ,i.e $s$ such that: $s_p \in \mathbb{S^p_1} \, , \, F_2(s_p)=m(p)$ (This follows from the above example together with this answer ) Of course, when such a continuous choice as described in (2) is possible this imediately implies continuity of $m$. A Finsler vector bundle is a (smooth) vector bundle $E$ over a (smooth) manifold $M$  together with a Finsler function $F : E \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for every vector $v \in E$: (1) $F$ is smooth on the complement of the zero section of $E$.

The reason I ask this is because, while working on a problem involving Stokes' Theorem, I deduced that the appropriate normal vector for some surface was $\hat{i} + \hat{k}$, and so I normalized it, yielding $\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\hat{i} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\hat{k}$.

1561323,Understanding better linear regression,"I have been trying to understand linear regression as much as possible, so I am asking you this question in order to keep doing it. There's simple linear regression, where we have just one independent variable $x$, and we have multiple linear regression, where there are multiple predictors. In a linear regression related problem we usually have data for the predictors and the response variable, whereas what we need to find is a line that better estimates the linearly relationship between $y$ and the predictors. Of course a line will not describe perfectly the relationship between many observations $x_i$ and $y_i$ unless the relationship is really mathematically linear, which is usually not the case in the real world (I guess). That's why we want to estimate the ""best line"", there might be errors, which usually we denote with $\epsilon$ in the following perfect model $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots+ \beta_n x_n + \epsilon$$
The line that we want to estimate has therefore no ""error terms"" $\epsilon$, because they cannot estimated, thus it should look like $$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{x}_1 + \cdots+ \beta_n \hat{x}_n$$ What we need to find from this line are the coefficients, and we can find them using least squares for example. This is what I have understood so far. I am not even sure if this is all correct.

For the second estimator I had until now: $$E[m_2(x,h)]=\int K_{h}(z-x)m(z)\frac{f(z)}{f(z)}dz=\int K(\frac{z-x}{h})m(z)dz=h\int K(u)m(x+uh)du$$
$$= hm(x)\int K(u)du+\frac{1}{2}h^3m´´(x)\int u^2K(u)du=hm(x)+\frac{1}{2}h^3m´´(x)\int u^2K(u)du+o(h^2)$$

1561597,"Probability in the board game ""Istanbul""","I tried this game yesterday with a couple of friends (really interesting, although I did not win, I would definitely recommend it) here is a small piece of the game: A player first calls out a number between 2-12,(name this variable x) then rolls two dices, (name the result y) if $y \ge x$, then player gets x number of dollars. If $y<x$, then the player only gets 2 dollars (the lowest possible value) and if the player has completed a certain task he will also have the following ability: After rolling two dices, the player can choose either re-roll or replace the number of one dice with the number 4 My question is what should my strategy be before and after I completed the task given that I want to maximize my revenue Before the task, I am thinking...
$$E(12)=12*{1\over36}+2*{35\over36}=2.27$$
$$E(11)=11*{3\over36}+2*{33\over36}=2.75$$
$$E(10)=10*{6\over36}+2*{30\over36}=3.33$$
$$E(9)=9*{10\over36}+2*{26\over36}=3.94$$
$$E(8)=8*{15\over36}+2*{21\over36}=4.5$$
$$E(7)=7*{21\over36}+2*{15\over36}=4.92$$
to be honest I think calling 7 is pretty good, you have like 60% chance of getting it, 7 is the most common number for 2 dices, it also has the highest expected value in this case, is it a coincidence? $$E(6)=6*{26\over36}+2*{10\over36}=4.89$$
$$E(5)=5*{30\over36}+2*{6\over36}=4.5$$ After the task, its hard for me to calculate
$$E(7)=7*{32\over36}+{4\over36}*(EE(7))=6.768$$
I feel like this is correct, $32\over36$ is the probability of getting at least 1 dice $\ge$ 3 when rolling two dices. $EE(7)=7*{21\over36}+2*{15\over36}=4.92$ which is the expectation for 7 when I don't have the ability to replace/re-roll and if I was right about my calculation E(8)=7.125 and it should be the biggest expectation ? This is pretty neat. I thought even though I completed the task, the expectation distribution should be the same as the previous (7 is still the most likely number? 90+?) now what should my strategy be? completing the task is going to cost me some time...well it raised my lower bound by a lot(previous 2, now 5:4+anything) but if I just call out 8 every time... I am getting 1+ compare to calling 7 every time(even though the expected value is differ by 2.2, still not much) How should I estimate the cost of getting the task done? can someone check my answers? and answer my doubts? great thanks...I need my revenge :)","['game-theory', 'statistics', 'probability']"

 Is $f$ then uniformly continuous on $X$? If yes, is the following proof right? If not, where is the error in my proof? Proof: Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given. Since $f$ is uniformly continuous on $E$, there is some $\delta > 0$ such that $$\forall_{x,y \in E}\;d_X(x,y)<\delta \Rightarrow d_Y(f(x),f(y))< \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ Now let $x,y \in X$ be arbitrary with $d_X(x,y) < \frac{\delta}{3}$. Because $f$ is continuous at $x$ and $y$ there are $\lambda_x$ and $\lambda_y$ such that $$\forall_{z \in X}\;d_X(z,x)<\lambda_x \Rightarrow d_Y(f(z),f(y)) < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ and $$\forall_{z \in X}\;d_X(z,y)<\lambda_x \Rightarrow d_Y(f(z),f(y)) < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$$ We set $k:= \min\{\lambda_x, \lambda_y, \delta/3\}$ and find (since $E$ is dense in $X$) $x', y' \in E$ such that $d_X(x,x') < k$ and $d_X(y,y') <k$. But then we have $$d_X(x',y') \leq d_X(x',x)+d_X(x,y)+d_X(y,y') < \frac{\delta}{3}+\frac{\delta}{3}+\frac{\delta}{3} = \delta$$ and thus $$d_Y(f(x),f(y))\leq d_Y(f(x),f(x'))+d_Y(f(x'),f(y'))+d_Y(f(y'),f(y)) < \frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3}+\frac{\epsilon}{3} = \epsilon$$","['continuity', 'uniform-continuity', 'real-analysis', 'proof-verification']"
1561672,Is there an easier way to show that a tetrahedron is optimal?,"Basically, I'm trying to address a problem that somewhat mirrors electron geometry, and I'm phrasing it like this: Consider four points in three dimensional space ($P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4$) such that each $P_i$ is on the unit sphere. Define the disturbance of the four points as:
$$ D(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)=\sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 4} \frac{1}{|P_i-P_j|^2}$$ Where $|P_i-P_j|$ is the euclidean distance between $P_i$ and $P_j$. My goal is to minimize the disturbance of the four points, and show that the four points which minimize the disturbance form a tetrahedron. Since we are only considering the shape (up to rotation), we can assume w.l.o.g. that $P_1=(1,0,0)$, and that $P_2$ also lies on the plane $z=0$. To do this, I've decided to parametrize these points as:
$$ P_2=(\cos(\alpha),\sin(\alpha),0)$$
$$ P_3=(\sin(\phi_1)\cos(\theta_1),\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\theta_1),\cos(\phi_1))$$
$$ P_3=(\sin(\phi_2)\cos(\theta_2),\sin(\phi_2)\sin(\theta_2),\cos(\phi_2))$$ And in this sense, the disturbance is a function from $\mathbb{R}^5$ to $\mathbb{R}$. I took the partial derivatives with respect to each variable and set them equal to zero, but it just all gives an incredibly nasty system of equations that I don't know how to simplify.

1561762,Lipschitz continuity is equivalent to absolute continuity with bounded derivative,"I am trying to show that a function is a Lipschitz $M$ continuous if and only if it is absolutely continues and $|f'(x)| \leq M$. I think I am on the right track: Proof:
(=>) Let f be Lipschitz M continues  ie if $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq M|x-y|$ for all $x,y \in E=[a,b]$. now we want to show abs cont: $\sum^n_{i=1}|f(x'_i)-f(x_i)|< \epsilon$  if  $\sum^n_{i=1}|x'_i-x_i|< \delta$ for all any finite collection of disjoint intervals $(x'_i,x_i)$. Consider we let $\sum^n_{i=1}|x'_i-x_i|< \delta$, then we observe that  $\sum^n_{i=1}|f(x'_i)-f(x_i)| \leq M \sum^n_{i=1}|x'_i-x_i|$ by the Lipschitz M continues and triangle inequality. Then define $\epsilon = M \delta$ and we are done. To see that $|f'(x)| \leq M$ we can just let $x'_i=x_i+h$ and have the following $|f(x_i+h)-f(x_i)| \leq M|x_i+h-x_i|$ thus we have $\frac{|f(x_i+h)-f(x_i)|}{|h|}\leq M$ and if we take the limit and take it inside the absolute values we are done. (<=) Now assume abs continuity and  $|f'(x)|=M$ now by another theorem we know that f is absolute continues if and only if it is an indefinite integral $f(x)= \int_a ^x f'(t)dt +f(a)$  we can manipulate this to $f(x)-f(a) \leq \int_a ^x Mdt$ . Now we can integrate the RHS to get $\int_a ^x Mdt = M (x-a)$ now we have $f(x)-f(a) \leq M (x-a)$ we can take the absolute calues of both sides and we are done.

Let $\mathcal O = \textrm{Im}^{\textrm{pre}}(\alpha)$ be the presheaf $U \mapsto \textrm{Im }( \alpha(U))$, and let $\textrm{Im } \alpha$ be a sheafification of this presheaf.  There is a canonical choice of $\textrm{Im } \alpha$ which is actually a subsheaf of $G$, which is directly obtained by using the universal property on any sheafification of $\mathcal O$, and does not depend on the specific choice of sheafification.  Assuming $(\textrm{Im } \alpha, \theta)$ (where $\theta: \mathcal O \rightarrow \textrm{Im } \alpha$ is the universal map) is this canonical sheafification, we say that the sequence is exact if $\textrm{Im } \alpha$ is equal to the sheaf $\textrm{Ker } \beta$. I'm having trouble understanding the proof of the result that the sequence is exact if and only if the corresponding sequence on the stalks $F_x \xrightarrow{\alpha_x} G_x \xrightarrow{\beta_x} H_x$ is exact for all $x \in X$. For example, let me suppose that $\textrm{Im } \alpha = \textrm{Ker } \beta$.  Let $i, i^+$ be the respective inclusion morphisms of $\mathcal O, \textrm{Im } \alpha$ into $G$.  Since $i^+ \circ \theta = i$, and $i^+$ maps $\textrm{Im } \alpha$ onto the kernel of $\beta$, we have that also $i$ maps $\mathcal O$ into $\textrm{Ker } \beta$, i.e. $\textrm{Im } (\alpha(U)) \subseteq \textrm{Ker } \beta(U)$ for all $U$.  Thus $\beta \circ \alpha$ is the zero morphism, which implies $\beta_x \circ \alpha_x = 0$ for all $x$.

$$ n = 13 : 3*2 + 7*1$$
$$ n = 14 : 3*0 + 7*2$$ Induction hypothesis: Assume for some $k>14$ that $k = 3a + 7b$ for $a, b \in Z$. Induction step: We will show that $k + 1$ can be made up of 3 and 7 cent stamps. $$k+1 = 3a + 7b + 1$$
$$k+1 = 3a + 7b + 7 -6$$
$$k+1 = 3a - 6 + 7b + 7$$
$$k+1 = 3(a-2) + 7(b+1)$$ So when $a > 2$ we can make $k + 1$ stamps. Is it at this point that I need to also clarify when $a = 1$ and $a = 0$ that other cases of $k$ will hold as well?

The clever answer is to realize that the integration of curl on these 5 regions of interest is the same as the line integral ($\int F \cdot \vec{dr}$) around the perimeter of the base. This line integral of the base's perimeter is also equal to the curl through this one face (as if it were there). 1) I cannot convince myself that this boundary ""covers"" all 5 sides of the square (ie, that the line integral of the boundary equals the integration of curl on the five higher faces). I would think that each of these faces is only describable, with a line integral, using its own perimeter. 2) If this is true, I am curious to know whether the curl through any solid with edges (and with one empty face) can be found simply by finding the line integral of the vector field on the empty face's perimeter. For example, can taking the line integral around the pentagon shown in the buckeyball give me the flux through all other faces?","['multivariable-calculus', 'stokes-theorem']"

Using these rules, a lot of the standard differentiation rules that you would expect can be easily proven:
$$ (a^n)'=na^{n-1}a'$$
$$ \left( \frac{a}{b} \right)'=\frac{a'b-b'a}{b^2}$$ The field is not required to be a field of functions; however, I have found that every instance of a differential field that I have seen (other than any field being endowed with the trivial derivation $\forall x,x'=0$ has been some sort of function field (usually a $F(x)$ for some field $F$ or something like the field of meromorphic functions). I was then curious if the chain rule could somehow carry over, and this got me thinking about what a functions field really was. I guess my question can then be formulated: Let $K$ be a field. Now let $F$ be a set of functions which map from $K$ into $K$ such that $F$ forms a field under point-wise addition and multiplication and $F$ is closed under composition and differentiation. My question is, what conditions must we place on $K$ or $F$ for it to be true that whenever $f,g\in F$, the following holds:
$$ (f \circ g)'=(f' \circ g)\cdot g'$$ The only proof I have ever seen of the chain rule is done by analytical means; however, I suspect that it can be proven for fields like $Q(x)$ using purely algebraic means. Does anyone know anything about this?","['derivatives', 'field-theory']"

1562249,Proof of strong Markov Property of double sided Levy Process,"Let $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ be a Levy Process, i.e. $X_0 = 0$ a.s., $X$ has independent and stationary increments, and almost all paths $t\mapsto X_t(\omega)$ are right continuous with left hand limits. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the natural filtration of $X$, i.e. $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(X_s)_{s\leq t}$, and analogous $\mathcal{G}_t = \sigma (X_s)_{0\leq s \leq t}$ for $t\geq0$. It is a well known fact (can't think of a concrete reference right now, but the proof should be for example in Kallenberg's ""Foundations of Modern Probability Theory"") that the one-sided process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is strong $\mathcal{G}$-Markov, i.e. for any $\mathcal{G}$-stopping time $\tau$ with a.s. $\tau<\infty$, any $t>0$ and any Borel set $B$ the equation 
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{P}\left[ 
         X_{\tau+t}\in B \;\vert\; \mathcal{G}_\tau
    \right]
    =
    \mathbb{P}\left[ 
         X_{\tau+t}\in B \;\vert\; X_\tau
    \right]
    \qquad\qquad\text{a.s.}
\end{equation*}
is fulfilled, i.e. for any $G\in\mathcal{G}_\tau$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}\left[
        1G \cdot \mathbb{P}
        \left[
            X_{\tau+t}\in B \; \vert \; X_\tau
        \right]
    \right]
    =
    \mathbb{P} G\cap \{ X_{\tau+t}\in B \}
\end{equation*}
As far as i can remember, this proof used the independence of
$\mathcal{G}_t$ and $(X_{t+s}-X_t)_{s\geq 0}$, which follows from $X_0 = 0$ a.s. and the independent increments of $X$.
One can also proof the independence of $\mathcal{G}_\tau$ and
$(X_{\tau+s}-X_\tau)_{s\geq0}$. In the double-sided case of $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ and $\mathcal{F}$, this independence is not given, i.e. for $t<0$ the $\sigma$-Algebra $\mathcal{F}_t$ is not independent of $(X_{t+s}-X_t)_{s\geq0}$, because
$X_{t+s}-X_t = -X_t$ a.s. for $s=-t$.
Nevertheless, one can proof that $X$ is weakly $\mathcal{F}$-Markov, i.e. the above a.s. equation is fulfilled for all constant $\tau\equiv t\in\mathbb{R}$. This follows from the elementary properties of the conditional expected value. My question is now: Does the strong $\mathcal{F}$-Markov property also hold for the double-sided case? I would guess yes (heuristically you should still only need to know $X_\tau$ in order to determine the distribution of $(X_{\tau+s}-X_\tau)_{s\geq0}$, even if the latter process needs not be distributed as $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$). Like in the proof of the one-sided case, I would be happy for an explanation in the case $1<\vert \tau\Omega \vert < \infty$. EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I believe this to be untrue; heuristically only knowing $X_\tau$ doesn't tell you if $\tau >0$ or $\tau<0$, which I believe is important for the distribution of
""$X_{\tau+\vert \tau\vert}-X_\tau$"". Q: Is my thinking sound? Can someone produce a rigorous proof? EDIT: As requested, the Definition I use in my question (if this is not the standard definition, please inform me). By a double-sided (or two-sided; don't know the correct terminology) Levy Process I mean a Stochastic Process $X_t$ on the whole real line, i.e. $t\in\mathbb{R}$ (I can only find the case $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$ in the literature) with the following properties: (a). $X_0 = 0$ almost surely; (b). for almost every $\omega\in\Omega$ the path $X\omega : t\mapsto X_t\omega$ is an element of $D$, the space of all real functions 
$f:t\in\mathbb{R} \mapsto ft\in\mathbb{R}$, which are right-continuous, i.e.
$ft = \lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0} f(t+\varepsilon)$, and have left limits, i.e. $f(t-) := \lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0} f(t-\varepsilon)$ exists and is real. (c). $X$ has independent increments, i.e. for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and 
$t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n\in\mathbb{R}$ with $t_0<\cdots<t_n$ the increments
$X_{t_1}-X_{t_0},\dots,X_{t_n}-X_{t_{n-1}}$ are independent. (d). $X$ has stationary increments, i.e. for a fixed $c>0$ the increments $X_{t+c}-X_t$ and $X_{s+c}-X_s$, $s,t\in\mathbb{R}$, have the same distribution. This definition is actually a direct copy of the one-sided case $t\in\mathbb{R}_+$. The problem I have is the following: In the one-sided case, one can easily show the independence of $(X_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ and $(X_{T+t}-X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ for $T\in\mathbb{R}_+$, from which the strong Markov property follows (basic proof, which can be found in literature about Levy Processes; there is even a discussion about this proof on SE). As mentioned above, this independence doesn't follow in the double-sided case, which makes the proof of the strong MP non-transferable.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'markov-process', 'levy-processes']"

1562374,Dual Basis: Finite Versus Infinite Dimensional Linear Spaces,"Motivation I know that in a finite dimensional Euclidean space $\Bbb{E}^n$, for every basis $G=\{g_1,g_2,...,g_n\} \subset \Bbb{E}^n$ we can define a dual basis $G'=\{g^1,g^2,...,g^n\} \subset \Bbb{E}^n$ such that $$g_i \cdot g^j = \delta_{i}^{j} \tag{1}$$ Also, it can be proved that such a basis exists and it is unique. The main advantage of dual bases is that when we write an arbitrary vector as a linear combination of the original basis $G$ then we can obtain the coefficients of the linear combination by just using the orthogonality property of $G$ and $G'$ like below $$\begin{align} 
x &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}x^i g_i \\
x \cdot g^j &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} x^i g_i \cdot g^j = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x^i \delta_{i}^{j} = x^j \\
x &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x \cdot g^i) g_i
\end{align}
\tag{2}$$ Now, let us go into the infinite dimensional space of infinitely differentiable functions $f(x)$ over the interval $[-a,a]$. We all know that the eigen-functions of the Sturm-Liouville operator can form an orthonormal basis for such functions with proper boundary conditions at the end points. However, this is really a nice operator, a self-adjoint one which produces orthonormal eigen-functions. In some Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) , we encounter non-self-adjoint operators and we should expand our solution and boundary data in terms of their eigen-functions which unfortunately are not orthogonal anymore! Just to give an example, consider the following biharmonic boundary value problem (BVP) $$\begin{array}{lll}
\Delta^2 \Phi=0 & -a \le x \le a & -b \le y \le b \\
\Phi(a,y)=0 & \Phi_x(a,y)=0 & \\
\Phi(-a,y)=0 & \Phi_x(-a,y)=0 & \\
\Phi(x,b)=f(x) & \Phi_y(x,b)=0 & \\
\Phi(x,-b)=f(x) & \Phi_y(x,-b)=0 & \\
\end{array} \tag{3}$$ where we have the symmetry $f(-x)=f(x)$. Also, for the sake of continuity of boundary conditions at the corners we require that $$f(a)=f(-a)=f'(a)=f'(-a)=0 \tag{4}$$ Then solving this BVP leads to the following eigen-value problem $$ \left( \frac{d^4}{dx^4}+2\omega^2\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\omega^4 \right)X(x)=0 \\
   X(a)=X(-a)=X'(a)=X'(-a)=0 \tag{5}$$ which has a non-self adjoint operator. The eigen-functions are known as Papkovich-Fadle eigen-functions . They can form a basis for the infinite dimensional space of infinitely differentiable functions $f(x)$ satisfying $(4)$ over the interval $[-a,a]$. As I told before, these eigen-functions are not orthogonal and this makes finding the coefficients $c_i$ of the expansions $$f(x)= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_i X(\omega_i;x) \tag{6}$$ really difficult leading to solve an infinite system of linear algebraic equations for the unknown coefficients $c_i$! Questions $1.$ Is there a dual basis thing for the basis $X(\omega_i;x)$'s that can make the computation of $c_i$'s easier? To be more specific, is there some basis $Y(\omega_j;x)$ such that $$\int_{-a}^{a} X(\omega_i;x) Y(\omega_j;x) dx =\delta_{ij} \tag{7}$$ which can be considered to have the similar role of $g^j$. If such a thing existed then we could compute the $c_i$'s by using $(6)$ and the orthogonality in $(7)$ easily $$\int_{-a}^{a} f(x) Y(\omega_j;x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_i \int_{-a}^{a} X(\omega_i;x)  Y(\omega_j;x) dx = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_i \delta_{ij} = c_j \tag{8}$$ $2.$ If the answer to question $1$ is YES , how it can be computed?

1562512,Closed form for Euler sum with $H_{2n}$?.,"I ran across this Euler sum while trying to evaluate an integral. I mentioned it in another thread, but though perhaps asking about it separate may be a good idea. Is there a closed form for this Euler sum? 
  $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{2n}}{n(6n+1)}.$$ Numerically, it converges to around $0.502788$ I found that sum while trying to evaluate $$\int_{0}^{1}\log(1+x^{3})\log(1-x^{3})dx=\int_{0}^{1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\left(H_{n}-H_{2n}-\frac{1}{2n}\right)dx$$ I managed to obtain two of the sums. This is the only one giving me trouble. It comes from the identity: $$\log(1+x)\log(1-x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\left(H_{n}-H_{2n}-\frac{1}{2n}\right)x^{2n}$$ Note that: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{n}}{n(6n+1)}=1/4\left(-72+2\gamma^{2}+\pi^{2}+4\gamma\psi(1/6)+2\psi(1/6)-2\psi_{1}(7/6)\right)$$ and $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}(6n+1)}=3\sqrt{3}\pi+\zeta(2)+9\log(3)+12\log(2)-36.$$ I thought maybe the residue method would work, but I am not so sure. By considering $f(z)=\frac{\pi cot(\pi z)(\gamma+\psi(-2z))}{z(6z+1)}$ The residue at the origin is $18-\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}$ The residue at $-1/6$ is $3\pi (\gamma+\psi(1/3))$ But, there does not appear to be a residue for the positive half integers. The series for the positive integers is: $$\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{(z-n)^{2}}+\frac{H_{2n}}{z-n}+...$$ which gives a residue of : $$\frac{-1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{12n+1}{n^{2}(6n+1)^{2}}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{2n}}{n(6n+1)}+....=\frac{1}{2}\psi_{1}(7/6)-\frac{\pi^{2}}{12}+H$$ At the negative integers: $$\frac{H_{2n}}{z+n}+....$$ giving a residue of: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_{2n-1}}{n(6n+1)}$$ I do not think it quite adds up though. I could have easily went astray in all of that, though.","['summation', 'integration', 'sequences-and-series']"

1563040,Let $f$ be Lipschitz and $g$ be absolutely continuous. Show that the composition $f\circ g$ is absolutely continuous.,"I want to prove: Let $f$ be Lipschitz on $\mathbb{R}$ and $g$ be absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$. Show that the composition $f\circ g$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$. Proof: For $f$ being Lipschitz, there exist a constant $c \geq 0$ such that
$$|f(x')-f(x)| \leq c|x'-x| \ \forall x',x \in \mathbb{R}.$$ Now, let $g$ to be absolutely continuous and let $\epsilon>0$. Choose $\delta > 0$, such that for any disjoint collection $\{(a_k,b_k)\}_{k=1}^n$ of $(a,b)$, we have
$$\sum_{k=1}^n[b_k-a_k] < \delta \Rightarrow \sum_{k=1}^n[g(b_k)-g(a_k)] < \frac{\epsilon}{c}.$$
In particular, for the composition $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$, we obtain
$$|f(g(x'))-f(g(x))| \leq c|g(x')-g(x)| \ \forall x',x \in \mathbb{R}.$$
Thus, for each $k = \{1,2, \ldots,n\}$, we have
$$|f(g(b_k))-f(g(a_k))| \leq c|g(b_k)-g(a_k)|,$$
it follows that 
$$\sum_{k=1}^n|f(g(b_k))-f(g(a_k))| \leq c\sum_{k=1}^n|g(b_k)-g(a_k)| < \epsilon,$$

1563043,Differentiating $e^x$ from first principles using limits.,"I have been trying to differentiate the exponential function from first principles without the use of Taylor's series or the derivative of its inverse function ($\frac{d}{dx} (\ln x) = \frac{1}{x}$ and $\ln (e^x) = x$. Let $f(x) = e^x$, then differentiating $f(x)$ from first principles,
$$f^\prime(x) = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\delta x) - f(x)}{\delta x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{e^{x+\delta x} - e^x}{\delta x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0}\frac{e^x(e^{\delta x} - 1)}{\delta x} = e^x \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{e^{\delta x} - 1}{\delta x}$$ Therefore, in order to prove from first principles that $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x$, I would need to first show that
$$\lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac{e^{\delta x} - 1}{\delta x} = 1$$ However, I am not sure how to evaluate this limit and the use of L'Hôpital's rule requires preliminary knowledge on the derivative of $e^x$. Is it possible to prove the derivative of $e^x$ from first principles solely using limits, or is it impossible as the knowledge of its derivative is a prerequisite to its discovery by Bernoulli?","['derivatives', 'exponential-function', 'limits-without-lhopital', 'limits']"
1563058,Let $f$ be integrable over $\mathbb{R}$. Show that the following four assertions are equivalent:,"Let $f$ be integrable over $\mathbb{R}$. Show that the following four assertions are equivalent: $f = 0$ a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$. $\int_{\mathbb{R}}fg=0$ for every
  bounded measurable function $g$ on $\mathbb{R}$. $\int_A f = 0$ for 
  every measurable set $A$. $\int_{\mathcal{O}} f = 0$ for every open
      set $\mathcal{O}$. $(1) \Rightarrow (2)$ If $f = 0$ a.e. on $\mathbb{R} $, then $m(E_0) = 0$, where $$E_0 =\{x \in \mathbb{R} : f(x) \neq 0\}.$$
Now, by the previous exercise, we shown that for $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ being bounded and measurable, then $fg$ is integrable and
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}}fg = \int_{\mathbb{R}\sim E_0}fg + \int_{E_0}fg,$$
but since $$f = 0 \text{ a.e  and } m(E_0) = 0,$$
we have $$\int_{\mathbb{R}\sim E_0}fg =0,$$
and
$$\int_{E_0}fg = 0,$$
thus,
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}}fg = 0,$$ as required. $(2) \Rightarrow (3)$ For a measurable set $A$, let $g = \chi_A$. Clearly, $g$ is measurable and bounded. Therefore,
$$0= \int_{\mathbb{R}}fg =  \int_{\mathbb{R}}f \chi_A =  \int_A f = 0,$$
as required. $(3) \Rightarrow (4)$ Since every open set is measurable, then if $(3)$ holds, we have
$$\int_{\mathcal{O}}f = 0 \text{ for every open set $\mathcal{O}$, }$$
as required. $(4) \Rightarrow (1)$ Let $\{U_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable collection of open sets. Then,
$$G = \bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathcal{O}_n,$$
is a $G_\delta$ set with $\mathcal{O}_n = \bigcap_{k \leq n}U_k,$ where each $U_k$ is an open set. Thus, $\{\mathcal{O}_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a countable descending collection of open sets, i.e.
$$\forall i \in \mathbb{N}: \mathcal{O}_i \supset \mathcal{O}_{i+1}.$$
Now, for $\mathcal{O}_n$ being open, we have
$$\int_{\mathcal{O}_n} f = 0,$$
and by the continuity of integration, 
$$\int_{G} f  =\int_{\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \mathcal{O}_n} f = \lim_{n \to \infty} \int_{\mathcal{O}_n} f = 0.$$
Since every measurable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}$ is of the form $G \sim E_0$, where $G$ is a $G_{\delta}$ subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $m(E_0) = 0$, so that 
$$\int_{E} f = 0 \text{ for each measurable set } E \subset \mathbb{R}.$$
Now, define
$$E^+ = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: f(x) \geq 0 \} \text{ and } E^- = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: f(x) \leq 0 \},$$
then $E^+$ and $E^-$ are measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and thus, 
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f^+ = \int_{E^+} f = 0,$$
and
$$\int_{\mathbb{R}} (-f^-) = -\int_{E^-} f = 0,$$
where $f^+ = \max\{f,0\}$ and $f^- = \max\{-f,0\}$. Finally we use the fact (proposition $9$ chapter $4$) that
$$\int_E f = 0 \text{ if and only if } f = 0 \text{ a.e}$$
so that $f^+$ and $f^-$ vanishes almost everywhere in $\mathbb{R}$ and so does $f$ as required.","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"
