167159,diagonalizing a matrix over the $\ell$-adics,"Let $M$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$ whose characteristical polynomial is $$
P(T) = T^2- (a+d) T + (ad-bc). 
$$ I've encountered the following assertion: If $P(T)$ factors over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell \mathbb{Z}$ as $$
P(T) = (T-\lambda_1)(T-\lambda_2)
$$
with $\lambda_1 \not\equiv \lambda_2 \pmod{\ell}$, then in fact $M$ is diagonalizable over $\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$. I was able to prove this using a straightforward argument by diagonalizing over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell \mathbb{Z}$ and then explicitly lifting. However, I was wondering if there was a more conceptual way to explain this in terms of Hensel's Lemma or something (i.e. a more conceptual way to package this lifting argument).","['modules', 'commutative-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'p-adic-number-theory']"

167196,"Congruence subgroups and modular curves of type (M,N)","I would like to study the ""modular curve"" $Y(M,N)$, parametrizing an elliptic curve $E$ together with $p \in E[M]$ and $q \in E[N]$ (here and in the following $M$ divides $N$). Let $\Gamma(M,N)$ be the subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ of matrices $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$, where $a-1=b=0 \mod M$, $c=d-1=0 \mod N$. Observe that $\Gamma(M,N)$ contains $\Gamma(N)$, the principal congruence subgroup of level $N$. Now define $Y(M,N)$ as the quotient of the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}$ by the action of $\Gamma(M,N)$. Questions: 1) Does $Y(M,N)$ parametrize what I wrote in the first paragraph? 2) Is $Y(M,N)$ well-known and studied as $Y(N)$ is? Are there references? 3) For example, what are the irreducible components of $Y(M,N)$? Are they identified, via the restriction of the Weil pairing of $E[N] \times E[N]$, to the elements of $\mu_M$?
EDIT: (See answer by David Loeffler) As observed below, this is clearly irreducible. The question is if this truly parametrizes triples $(E,p,q)$ as in the first paragraph, with fixed value of the Weil pairing. 4) Is there any hope of saying what is its genus? Is everything easily deducible from the known properties of the usual congruence subgroups and modular curves?","['modular-forms', 'modular-arithmetic', 'algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves']"
167203,cyclic polygons & trigonometry,"At one vertex of a pentagon inscribed in a circle of unit diameter (unit diameter, not unit radius) let the angles between adjacent diagonals be $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ , at the next, $\beta,\gamma,\delta$ , at the next $\gamma,\delta,\varepsilon$ , then $\delta,\varepsilon,\alpha$ , and finally $\varepsilon,\alpha,\beta$ .  Note that $$
\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta+\varepsilon=\pi. \tag{constraint}
$$ Later note: (Lest anything be misunderstood, notice that what I wrote above is true of all pentagons inscribed in a circle.  Angles with vertices on the circle have the same measure if they're subtended by the same arc.  Consequently if the three angles between adjacent diagonals at one vertex are $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ , in that order, then two of the angles between adjacent diagonals at one of the neighboring vertices must be $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , and two of those at the other neighboring vertex must be $\beta$ and $\gamma$ .  And regardless of the shape of the pentagon, the sum of the five angles must be a half-circle.  That's a general proposition about polygons inscribed in a circle, which, when applied to triangles, says the sum of the three angles is a half-circle.) End of later note It's not hard to show that the area of the pentagon is $$
\frac{\sin(2\alpha)+\sin(2\beta)+\sin(2\gamma)+\sin(2\delta)+\sin(2\varepsilon)}{8}.\tag{1}
$$ It's somewhat more work than that to show that if the ""constraint"" above holds, then $(1)$ is equal to $$
\frac 1 2 \left(\overbrace{\sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma}^\text{sines}\  \overbrace{\cos\delta\cos\varepsilon}^\text{cosines} +\  \cdots\text{nine more terms }\cdots\  - \overbrace{2\sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma\sin\delta\sin\varepsilon}^\text{all sines} \right).
$$ (It should be obvious what the nine more terms are: choose three factors in each term to be sines and then the other two are cosines.) (As far as I know, this is my own.  I've mentioned it here at least once before.) Can the eleven terms be interpreted as areas? LATER EDIT: Even for quadrilaterals it seems mysterious.  If the angles between adjacent diagonals are $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta=\pi$ , and two of them occur at each vertex, and each occurs at two of the four vertices, the the area is \begin{align}
& \frac{\sin(2\alpha)+\sin(2\beta)+\sin(2\gamma)+\sin(2\delta)}{8} \\[8pt]
= {} & \frac 1 2\Big(\overbrace{\sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma}^\text{sines}\  \overbrace{\cos\delta}^\text{cosine}+\cdots\text{ three more terms }\cdots\Big)
\end{align} You might think that the four terms are areas of the four triangles into which the polygon is divided by the diagonals.  But guess what??  They're not! Similarly, the pentagram divides the pentagon into $11$ triangles, and there are $11$ terms on the right side, but they don't correspond to the areas.","['trigonometry', 'polygons', 'metric-geometry']"

167225,Unification of expressions involving sets,"Let's let $\def\OP#1#2{\left\langle#1,#2\right\rangle}\OP xy$ represent the set $\{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}$ as is usual, per Kuratowski. Then: $$
\begin{eqnarray}
\OP{\OP ab}c  & = & \{\{\{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}\}, \{\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}, c\}\} \\
\OP x{\OP yz} & = & \{\{x\}, \{x, \{\{y\}, \{y,z\}\}\}\}
\end{eqnarray}
$$ I would like to unify these two equations to produce a set of relations on $a,b,c,x,y,z$ that give the most general conditions for which $ \OP{\OP ab}c = \OP x{\OP yz}$. The unification algorithm I know works on expressions. Applying it to $ \OP{\OP ab}c = \OP x{\OP yz}$ directly gives $x=\OP ab, c=\OP yz$. This is correct, but may not be the most general possible set of conditions. I can also abbreviate $\{x\}$ as $Sx$ and $\{y,z\}$ as $Dyz$, so that $\OP xy = \{\{x\}, \{x, y\}\} = DSxDxy$.  Then the two set expressions I want to unify become $DSDSaDabDDSaDabc$ and $DSxDxDSyDyz$.  I can unify these; the result is the same as in the previous paragraph. But this may not be fully general, because it fails to capture the fact that for sets , $\{a, a\} = \{a\}$. Abbreviating $\{x\}$ as $Sx$ and $\{y,z\}$ as $Dyz$, and attempting to unify $\{x\}$ and $\{y, z\}$ with this method fails outright.  But I want it to succeed and to yield the equations $x=y, x=z$. How can I fix either the unification algorithm or my representation of the expressions to allow $\{x\}$ to unify with $\{y, z\}$? I can make some progress on this particular problem by representing $\{x\}$ as $Dxx$.  Then $\{x\}$ unifies with $\{y,z\}$ because $Dxx$ unifies with $Dyz$ giving $x=y, x=z$ as I wanted. But this is not quite enough either, because it doesn't understand that $\{x, y\} = \{y, x\}$.  I want the unification of $\{x, y\}$ with $\{a, b\}$ to give me not simply $x=a, y=b$ but $[x=a, y=b] \lor [x=b, y=a]$. The problem grows worse if any of the sets have more than two elements. There are several possible ways in which  $\{x, y\}$ could unify with $\{a,b,c\}$. For example, we might have $x=a=c, y=b$, or $x=c, y=a=b$. Is there a modified version of the unification algorithm that can handle unification of sets in this way?","['unification', 'elementary-set-theory', 'universal-algebra']"

167238,Is it unlikely to get the same number of heads/tails?,"A question in probability by a non-mathematician: A fair coin is tossed $2N$ times. Is it unlikely that we get exactly $N$ heads and $N$ tails? From one side, this must be the most likely result! But intuitively, if someone reports to me that they threw 2,000,000 coins and got exactly 1,000,000 heads and 1,000,000 tails I would be a little suspicious. If this really is suspicious, how does it compare to biased results? Obviously, 2,000,000 heads is a much more suspicious result. But, for what value of $K$ is $N+K$ heads and $N-K$ tails as suspicious as $N$ heads and $N$ tails? Equations are very welcome, but please try to provide some aid in understanding them. ADDED : Henning Makholm's answer helped me understand better what I want to ask: I always assume a fair coin and would like to compare the probability of the split N/N with the probability of getting either more than more than N+K or less than N-K heads. By ncmathsadist's answer , the probability for the N/N split goes like 1 over the square root of N.  What about the probability to get more than either more than N+K or less than N-K heads? For what value of K (approximately) does it equal to 1/sqrt(n pi)? CLARIFICATION : If f(N) is the probability to get an N/N split in 2N tosses of a fair coin, and g(N,K) is the probability to get more that N+K heads or less than N-K heads in 2N tosses of a fair coin, then I am asking for a formula which, given N, approximates the values of K for each f(N) is closest to g(N,K). This is a formula that takes N and returns K so we can call it h(N)=K. Which kind of function is h? My guess from a little experementing with the online software in Brian M.

167262,Value of $n$ for which an improper integral is convergent.,"A question from the Calculus book that I'm self-studying is asking me to determine the value of $n$ for which the improper integral below is convergent: $$\int_1^{+\infty}\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2 + n} \right ) dx$$ My attempt is below: Using the definition of improper integral: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \int_1^{b}\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2 + n} \right ) dx$$ I will first solve the indefinite integral: $$\int\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2+n} \right )dx = \int \frac{n}{x+1}dx-\int \frac{3x}{2x^2+n}dx$$ For the first integral, $\int \frac{n}{x+1}dx=n\ln (x+1) + \text{constant}$. For the second integral, substituting $u = 2x^2+n$ (and therefore $dx=\frac{du}{4x}$), $\int \frac{3x}{2x^2+n}dx=\frac{3}{4}\int \frac{1}{u}du=\frac{3}{4}\ln(2x^2+n) + \text{constant}$. So, the result for the whole integral is: $$\int\left( \frac{n}{x+1} - \frac{3x}{2x^2+n} \right )dx = n\ln(x+1) - \frac{3}{4}\ln(2x^2+n) + \text{constant} = \ln\left(\frac{(x+1)^n}{(2x^2+n)^{3/4}}\right) + \text{constant}$$ Thus, the value of the definite integral from $x = 1$ to $x = b$ is: $$\ln\left(\frac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{(2)^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$$ Thus, the value of the improper integral is: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)\right]$$ For this limit to exist, it only depends on the limit of the term $\ln\left(\dfrac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$, because the term $\ln\left(\frac{2^n}{(2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$ is a constant. To calculate the limit of $\ln\left(\dfrac{(b+1)^n}{(2b^2+n)^{3/4}}\right)$ as $b\to +\infty$, I suppose we can neglect the terms $1$ in $(b+1)^n$ and $n$ in $(2b^2+n)^{3/4}$, because they become negligible as $b$ gets larger. Thus we get, for the limit of this term: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\frac{(b)^n}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right)$$ For the above limit to exist, it seems that $n = 3/2$ is the only possible value, because $\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{(b)^{3/2}}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{b^{3/2}}{2^{3/4}b^{3/2}}\right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln\left(\dfrac{1}{2^{3/4}}\right)$. If any different value for $n$ were chosen, the logarithm would approach $-\infty$ or $+\infty$, and therefore the limit would not exist. For $n = 3/2$, the value of the limit is: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{(b)^{3/2}}{(2b^2)^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^{3/2}}{(2+3/2)^{3/4}}\right)\right]=\lim_{b\to+\infty} \left[\ln\left(\frac{1}{2^{3/4}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{2^{3/2}}{(7/2)^{3/4}}\right)\right]=\frac{3}{4}\ln\frac{7}{16}$$ This is equal to the answer given by the book. So, this informal argument of neglecting the terms $1$ and $n$ worked. But I would like to ask if the reasoning above is correct, and if this informal way of finding the value of $n$ is good. Is there a more formal way? Edit : A more formal way of showing that $n$ should be $3/2$ is suggested by David Mitra in the comments to this question below: $$\lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln \left( {(b+1)^n\over (2b^2+n)^{3/4} } \right) = \lim_{b\to+\infty} \ln \left( {b^n\over b^{3/2}} \cdot {\bigl(1+{1\over b}\bigr)^n\over \bigl(2 +{n\over b^2}\bigr)^{3/4}} \right)$$ It is clear from above that $n$ should equal $3/2$. If it were a different value, the limit would not exist, because the expression inside the logarithm would approach either $0$ (causing the logarithm to approach $-\infty$) or $+\infty$ (causing the logarithm to tend to $+\infty$).","['improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'limits']"

167289,Determining the minimum number of pixels on the boundary of a circle drawn in discrete space,"I am trying to draw a circle in discrete space (actual image pixel space). I have the center (x,y) and radius r of a circle that I am supposed to draw. The manner in which I draw this circle is the following: Starting from the center position (x,y), I have a for loop over angles $\theta \in \{0,2\pi\}$. Lets say the angle is incremented by $\Delta\theta$ in every iteration. In each iteration, I calculate an x-deviation and a y-deviation based on,
$$\Delta x = r cos(\theta)\\ \Delta y = r sin(\theta).$$
The point on the circumference of the circle is then calculated as
$$x' = \text{round}(x + \Delta x)\\ y'= \text{round}(y + \Delta y).$$ This gives a location $(x', y')$ in discrete space at which I can color a pixel. How do I determine for a given radius, what is the minimum number of discrete ""pixels"" I will have along the circumference. In other words, lets say if I have a radius of 10, then how many unique discrete points would I have along the boundary of the circle? Is this problem well defined?

167303,How can I intuit the role of the central limit theorem in breaking the curse of dimensionality for Monte Carlo integration,"I would like to more intuitively understand where the power of Monte Carlo integration comes from for large-dimensional domains of integration. Other questions on this site have referenced the proof that the scaling of the error in a MC integration goes as $N^{-1/2}$, where $N$ is the number of function evaluations, and does not depend on the dimension $d$ of the domain of integration. On the other hand, the scaling of the error in a uniform sampling integration goes as some power of $N^{-1/d}$. Consequently, for a sufficiently large $d$, one may achieve a desired level of accuracy using a fewer number of function evaluations with a Monte Carlo method than with a uniform numerical quadrature method. The essence of the proof is an invocation of the central limit theorem. I understand the proof on a formal level. However, I have no intuition for why this proof works. It still seems like ""cheating"" to me that by either randomly or quasi-randomly selecting the locations to evaluate the function being integrated, you can achieve a more accurate integration than you would by choosing to evaluate the points in a uniform set of spacings (provided that the dimensionality of the integral is large enough). I have tried to construct an extremely non-rigorous analogy to conducting a statistical survey. One could either poll people at regular distance spacings in a neighborhood, or instead poll the same number of people in completely randomized locations. If there were no correlation between a person's response and the location where that person lives, then I would be able to conclude that my sampling error would be the same using either method. If there were such a correlation after all, then I might bias my results. Is this sort of reasoning at all on the right track to building intuition for the proof? To phrase my question another way, it seems that when performing a high-dimensional integral you gain accuracy by including a variety of length scales in the points where you evaluate the functions. Why is that? And, is the role of the randomness essentially to ensure that you use a wide range of length scales?","['integration', 'monte-carlo', 'computational-complexity', 'numerical-methods', 'intuition']"
167304,Complex part of a contour integration not using contour integration,"A propos of a user's comment on this question, quoting Feynman to the effect that some integrals are only possible using contour integration, I wonder what the simplest example of such an integral might be. In particular, he spoke of integrals that were the complex part of a solution, divorced from the rest of the solution. For me, something like $$I = \int_0^\infty \frac{\ln x}{x^2+1}dx, $$ seems hard; it falls out as the complex part of contour integration using the residue theorem in the problem, $$J = \int_0^\infty \frac{(\ln x)^2}{x^2+1}dx  . $$ That is, we can use contour integration to evaluate J and end up with something like $J + iI = \frac{\pi^3}{8}$ so we conclude $I = 0.$ Perhaps it is hard but I don't know that it can't be done without complex analysis [edit: Robjohn has shown it can be done without complex analysis]. So I would like to see one good example of the sort of thing Feynman might have had in mind.

My Attempt The approach that occurred to me is the following. Since $f(z)^2 + g(z)^2 = 1$ then we have $(f(z) + ig(z))(f(z) - ig(z)) =  1$. Then each factor is nonvanishing everywhere in $\mathbb{C}$ and thus by the ""holomorphic logarithm theorem"" we know that since $\mathbb{C}$ is simply connected, there exists a holomorphic function $H:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that $$e^{H(z)} = f(z) + ig(z)$$ and then we can write $\exp(H(z)) = \exp\left(i\dfrac{H(z)}{i} \right) = \exp(ih(z))$, where  $h(z) := \dfrac{H(z)}{i}$. Thus so far we have an entire function $h(z)$ that satisfies $$e^{ih(z)} = f(z) + ig(z)$$ On the other hand, we also know that $e^{iz} = \cos{z} + i \sin{z}$ for any $z \in \mathbb{C}$, thus we see that $$e^{ih(z)} = \cos{(h(z))} + i \sin{(h(z))} = f(z) + ig(z)$$ Thus at this point I would like to conclude somehow that we must have $f(z) = \cos(h(z))$ and $g(z) = \sin(h(z))$, but I can't see how and if this is possible.

Is it: ""[...] such that $gcd(a+1,N) = 1$ and $gcd(a-1,N) = 1$"" ? Or rather it is: ""[...] such that $gcd(a+1,N) = 1$ or $gcd(a-1,N) = 1$"" ?

trigonometric polynomial is an almost-periodic function .  This implies in
particular that: For $\epsilon > 0$, there is a number $L=L(\epsilon)$ such that any
interval of length $L$ on the real line has an $\epsilon$-translation
integer, that is, an integer $t$ such that $|P(n) - P(n +t)| < \epsilon$
for any $n$. From any sequence $\{P(n + m_k)\}$, one can extract a subsequence which
converges uniformly with respect to $n$.  Moreover the function to which it
converges is almost-periodic itself.  ($\{m_k\}$ is an arbitrary sequence
of numbers). In particular, for any sequence $\{m_k\}$, for any $\epsilon$, there exist
$i \neq j$ such that $m_i - m_j$ is an $\epsilon$-translation number. An even simpler case is to consider that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} P(n) =
0$.  A proof that it implies that $P(n) = 0$ for any $n$ is the following.
Suppose there is an $m$ such that $P(m) > 0$, and set $\epsilon = P(m)/2$.
Now for any $N$, there exists an $\epsilon$-translation number $t$ of $P$ with $t
> N$ an integer.  Then $|P(m) - P(m+t)| < \epsilon$, thus $P(m+t) >
\epsilon$.  Thus $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} P(n)$ is not null. ¹: Trigonometric polynomial is taken in the sense of, say, Corduneanu (in

167664,Gerrymandering on a high-genus surface/can I use my powers for evil?,"Somewhat in contrast to this question . Let's say the Supreme Court has just issued a ruling that the upper and lower roads of an overpass need not be in the same congressional district. This makes states with lots of overpasses into high-genus surfaces for the purpose of gerrymandering. I, an unscrupulous mathematician, get a call from my state legislature, asking me to consult for them about how best to place new roads in order to achieve their desired district layout, in exchange for a generous fee. Specifically, my state is a rectangle with no existing roads or overpasses. It has $n$ congressional districts. The state legislature has in mind a collection $\{P_{i,j}\}$ of convex polygons with nonempty interior which tile the state, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$ and $j$ from $1$ to at most $m$ for each $i$, and wishes for each $P_{i,j},P_{i',j}$ to be in the same congressional district, thus must be connected by roads (smooth curves). Any time a road passes through a polygon of a different congressional district, an overpass must be built across it to avoid disrupting the other district. Any time two roads meet, an overpass must also be built. Note that for any fixed $i$, some but not all of the $P_{i,j}$ may be empty. The legislature wants to know the minimum number $\mathcal O(n,m)$ of overpasses that need to be built in order to facilitate their gerrymandering, in the worst-case scenario. Equivalently, take a tiling of the unit square $S$ by convex polygons $P_{i,j}$, and $n$-color them such that at most $m$ polygons have the same color. For each color $i$, choose smooth curves $\lambda_{i1},\ldots,\lambda_{ir_i}:[0,1]\to S$ such that 
$$\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^m P_{i,j}\cup \bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{r_i}\mathrm{im}(\gamma_{ik})$$ is connected. For each color $i$, choose points $p_{i1},\ldots,p_{is_i}$ such that 
$$\left(\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^m P_{i,j}\setminus \left(\bigcup\limits_{i'\neq i}\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{r_{i'}}\mathrm{im}(\gamma_{i'k})\right)\right)\cup \{p_{i1},\ldots,p_{is_i}\}$$
is connected. If we can choose the curves and points freely, then $\mathcal O(n,m)$ is the worst-case (among all choices of tiling and coloring) minimum possible value of $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n s_i$. Clearly $\mathcal O(n,1)=0$. A very rough upper bound is $\mathcal O(n,m)\leq n(m-1)(nm-1)$ since we can connect the necessary districts by drawing $n(m-1)$ curves, none of which touch the boundary and each of which intersects at most all $\leq nm-1$ other districts, and intersect each polygon in straight lines. A rough lower bound comes from dividing the square into $nm$ vertical strips and coloring them cyclically, i.e. red, yellow, blue. red, yellow, blue etc. Then any path which connects all districts of the same color must pass through at least all but one district of each other color, so $\mathcal O(n,m)\geq (n-1)(m-1)$. Can these bounds be improved upon, or even an exact formula be found? Note: For those of you not in the United States, this question won’t make much sense unless you’re familiar with gerrymandering . Edit: This question was inspired by my state legislature (Kansas), which tried to make a congressional district which consisted of the conservative western third of the state, a road going across the state, and two liberal cities along the eastern border. Edit 2: For the purposes of this problem, I assume that at most two roads meet at any overpass.","['geometry', 'combinatorial-geometry']"

167702,How does a harmonic oscillator with nonlinear damping behave?,"It is well known that for a harmonic oscillator with linear damping,
$$\ddot x+c\dot x+x=0$$
with positive $c$, the amplitude of the oscillations decays exponentially when $c<2$. If it is higher than $2$, the system fails to oscillate at all and is said to be overdamped. Suppose the damping is nonlinear instead, following a power law
$$\ddot x+c\lvert \dot x\rvert^{p-1}\dot x+x=0.$$
For example, $p=1$ recovers linear damping, while $p=2$ gives quadratic damping which can model aerodynamic drag. I assume that in general a closed-form solution is not possible due to the presence of the absolute value signs. What can be said about the asymptotic behaviour of the system? Edit: While @doraemonpaul's comment and @mjqxxx's answer are very nice, I am more interested in stronger results than merely the existence or absence of overdamping. For comparison, consider a first-order nonlinear decay equation,
$$\dot x+\lvert x\rvert^{p-1}x=0.$$
The solution to this has the form $x = \pm(p-1)(t-t_0)^{1/(1-p)}$ with certain conditions on $t_0$. When $p<1$, the solution drops to zero in finite time; when $p>1$, it decays roughly as $t^{-1/(p-1)}$ which is much slower than exponential. What are the corresponding characterizations of how the amplitude of the nonlinearly damped harmonic oscillator behaves? What is the exponent of the decay when $p > 1$?

By a theorem by Hochschild(?), $G/K$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^n$, where $K$ is a(ny) maximal compact subgroup.

It is abstracted in the following way: ""Let $X_1$, $\cdots$, $X_n$ be $n$ i.i.d. random variables taken uniformly in $[[1, 365]]$. What is the probability that all the $X_i$'s are distinct?"" There are many generalizations, for instance: ""Let $n$, $d$ be two positive integers, $n \leq d$. Let $X_1$, $\cdots$, $X_n$ be $n$ i.i.d. random variables taken uniformly in $[[1, d]]$. What is the probability $p(n,d)$ that all the $X_i$'s are distinct?"" One can show that in the regimen $1 \ll n \ll d$, the probability $p(n,d)$ is logarithmically equivalent to something like $e^{-\frac{n^2}{2d}}$ (Wikipedia) or $e^{-\frac{n^2}{d}}$ (my computations)*. This problem can be reduced to simple combinatorics, and Stirling's formula (for instance) gives the solution. However, in the real world, the birthdays are not distributed that way . One might also want to estimate the probability that two peoples are born the same half-day, the same hour, etc. The following generalization seems natural: ""Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $[0,1]$ absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Let $n$, $d$ be two positive integers. For $k \in [[0,d-1]]$, let $a_k := [k/d, (k+1)/d]$. Let $X_1$, $\cdots$, $X_n$ be $n$ i.i.d. random variables in $[0,1]$ with distribution $\mu$. What is the probability $p(n,d)$ that all the $X_i$'s lie in different elements of the partition?"" I would expect the solution to be something like $e^{-C(\mu) \frac{n^2}{d}}$, with perhaps some explicit expression of $C(\mu)$. But the combinatorial solutions do not work as well in this setting, and all I can get are very crude bounds when the density of $\mu$ is bounded. In addition, I would expect $C(\mu)$ to be minimal when $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure, but I don't know how to prove it. One might wonder what happens when $\mu$ is no longer absolutely continuous, but this might be a bit too broad of a generalization. I am sure this problem has been done to death, but I don't have any access to the literature right now, and quick search didn't yield anything (the generalizations of the birthday problem I found are quite different). Any result/proof/reference related to the problems above would be nice. .* By the way, any rigorous proof of either of the two facts (or of any similar-sounding result) is appreciated. I don't know which I can trust more, between my computations and Wikipedia.","['reference-request', 'birthday', 'probability']"

167864,Fixed marginals of joint distribution: status,"One of the well-known problems of classical probability theory is the determination of the set of all extreme points in the convex set of all probability distributions in a product Borel space $\left (X \times Y, \:\:{\cal F} \times {\cal G} \right )$ with fixed marginal distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ on $\left (X, {\cal F} \right )$ and $\left (Y, {\cal G} \right )$ respectively. Denote this convex set by $C(\mu, \nu).$ When $X = Y = \left \{ 1,2,\ldots,n \right \},$ ${\cal F} = {\cal G}$ is the field of all subsets of $X$ and $\mu = \nu$ is the uniform distribution then the problem is answered by the Birkhoff. I do not work in probability theory. I have heard that the above result is the 'only' result in this direction. Is it true? Can someone please tell me the present status of the above problem. It is nice, if anybody can point out survey article(s) on this matter. My motivation is to look at the analogues  problem in a quantum set up. Birkhoff's theorem and methods are used in some works regarding quantum channels. Hence I want to know the present status of the problem.

167865,Spherical shell enclosing the Earth's surface,"What is the minimum thickness of a spherical shell that encloses the Earth's surface? The two spheres are concentric, the outer sphere encloses all the surface (to the highest mountain), and the inner sphere excludes all the surface (down to the deepest ocean trench). Yes, I know this is not strictly a mathematics question, but it is mathematical in some extended sense.  Of course, just subtracting the highest mountain peak from the deepest ocean
trench ignores the oblate spheroid shape of the Earth. I am curious to learn how close the Earth is to a sphere, and the shell thickness divided by, say, the inner radius, is one measure of that closeness.  Thanks!","['geometry', 'classical-mechanics']"

167926,Formal basis for variable substitution in limits,"So we do a lot of variable substitution in limits at school. Stuff like $\lim\limits_{x\to5}\ (x+1)^2\ =\ \lim\limits_{y\to6}\ y^2$, where we define the substitution $y = x + 1$. But I've never been clear on what exactly the theoretical basis for this is. What is the formula that you're actually applying when you do variable substitution? What are the formal conditions under which it is possible? My conjecture would be the following: For all continuous $f$, and all real $a$: $\lim\limits_{x\to a}\ (f\circ g)(x)\ =\lim\limits_{x\to g(a)}\ f(x)$, where $g$ is a continuous function So to take my first example, $f$ would be $x^2$, $g$ would be $x + 1$, and $a$ would be $5$.
