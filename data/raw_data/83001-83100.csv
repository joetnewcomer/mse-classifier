1083550,Is this estimator biased?,"I am struggeling to understand the how an estimator is arrived and whether it can be determined it is biased or not. I have this example
Let $X_1 , X_2 ,\ldots, X_7$ denote a random sample from a population having mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Consider the following estimator of $\mu$:
$$\hat{\Theta}_1 = \frac{X_1 + X_2 +\cdots+ X_7}{7}$$
$$\hat{\Theta}_2 = \frac{2X_1 − X_6 + X_4}{2}$$ a) Is either Estimator unbiased? So since these are trying to estimate the $\mu$, $E[\hat{\Theta}] = \mu$.
So i've done it like this 
 $E[\hat{\Theta}_1] = \frac{E[X_1] + E[X_2]+\cdots+E[X_7]}{7}$.
And since the expected value has been taken from the same population, we would expect it would be the same in all cases therefore it can be rewritten as 
 $E[\hat{\Theta}_1] = \frac{7E[X]}{7} = E[X]$.
which lead to showing that it is unbiased. My confusing occurs when i use the Expected value on an estimator estimating $\mu$, it does not make sense to do that, (and seems incorrect to say so), since it's like finding the expected value of $\mu$, which obviously is $\mu$. 
So what am I doing wrong?","['statistics', 'means', 'estimation', 'parameter-estimation']"

I've always relied on this principle when solving combinatorics problems for the mathematical olympiads, where a high level of formalization is not necessary, but recently I've seen it in a group theory proof, so I wonder: is there a mathematically formal and rigorous formulation of this principle and, if so, what is its proof?","['pigeonhole-principle', 'combinatorics']"

In that case the inner product: $$x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3+\dots+x_ny_n$$ Is the cosine of the angle between them. For an application I was originally interested in the angle like this, but I have only been able to achieve the squared inner product: $$x_1^2y_1^2+x_2^2y_2^2+x_3^2y_3^2+\dots+x_n^2y_n^2$$ And now I wonder if this has any interesting geometrical interpretations? I suppose it can't be too closely related to the angle between the vectors, given the value can only be in the interval $[0,1]$. I suppose this is also similar to what we have in the Cauchy Schartz inequality, after some rewriting, but I'm not sure what the geometric intepretation is of this.

Consider all $2\times d$ matrices with entries in $F_q$, so we have $q^{2d}$ matrices. Consider each matrix as a vertex, and two vertices $A$ and $B$ are adjacent when $\operatorname{rank}(A-B)=1$. We want to prove that this graph which was introduced is strongly regular. I fix an arbitrary vertex $A$. Because these matrices have two rows, I put one of rows (first row) of matrix $B$ with identity element of adding (first) operation of field, then put the other row (second) the converse of second row entries of $A$.

Now substitute first and second in above paragraph, then we have another $B$ with the properties we want, so I get this result that this graph is 2-regular, but I have no idea about $\lambda$ and $\mu$.

1083698,How many ways are there to put $mn$ balls of $n$ different colors in $n$ different boxes?,"This is a generalization of exercise number $60$ in Chapter $2$ of Hugh Gordon's Discrete Probability . We have $m$ balls of each of $n$ different colors. We also have $n$ boxes, each of a different shape. In how many ways can the balls be distributed among the boxes so that each box contains $m$ balls? The way I read this, there are a total of $mn$ balls. If we order the boxes (which we can without changing the results because they're different shapes) then we can find the number of possibilities for the first $m$ balls (i.e. the first box). Since we could have any color of ball in any amount in the first box, we can use stars and bars to find the number of possibilities. We imagine the color possibilities as the spaces between ""bars,"" so we have $n-1$ bars, and the (uncolored) balls as ""stars,"" so we have $m$ stars. This gives the number of possibilities for just the first box as $$\binom{m+n-1}{n-1}$$ However, the number for the second box varies greatly depending on which configuration the first box is in, so I don't think this method will continue to work. There has to be a better, elegant way to crack this one.",['combinatorics']

Show that there are infinitely many rows of Pascal's Triangle that consist entirely of odd numbers. Intuitively, if you draw boxes around the numbers in Pascal's triangle and color the boxes black if the number is odd and white if the number is even, then the triangle will look like the Sierpinsky triangle as you zoom out. In particular, if we number the rows starting with the top as $1$, the rows will all odd numbers will be exactly the rows with number $2^n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (or $n=0$ for the first). You can see this if you think about the Sierpinsky triangle coloring. Anyway, is there any direct way to show the following for all $k$ with $0 \leq k \leq 2^n-1$? $$\binom{2^n-1}{k} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$$ This can probably be done by induction but a direct proof would be preferable.","['modular-arithmetic', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

Person A found the value of $\pi$ and then it says that person B found more accurate value of $\pi$ (may be up to $100$ decimal places) and then person C found much more accurate value of $\pi$ and this goes on.

Then for each $\epsilon>0$, there is a measurable subset $X_{\epsilon}$ of $X$ for which $f_n→f$ uniformly on $X_{\epsilon}$ and $\mu(X\backslash X_\epsilon)<\epsilon$. Proof: Let $X_0$ be the set on which $f_n \to f$, so $\mu(X \backslash X_0)=0$. Let $m \in \Bbb N$. For every $x \in X_0$ we can find $n \in \Bbb N : |f_k(x)-f(x)|< \frac 1m\ \forall k \gt n$. Now define $$A_n^m = \{x\in X_0 : |f_n(x)-f(x)|< \frac 1m\},$$ and set $X_n^m=\bigcap_{k=n}^{\infty}A_k^m$. Since the $A_n^m$ are measurable and $X_n^m$ is the countable intersection of measurable sets, the $X_n^m$ are measurable. The $X_n^m$ are ascending, since as $n$ grows one is intersecting fewer and fewer of the $A_n^m$. And so on... And question is : How can I show that $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}X_n^m=X_0$?

1083812,Can we teach calculus without reals?,"This question is related to another question, Do we really need reals? , 
and could be considered a duplicate, so I would not be surprised if it will be put on hold. But I'm especially interested in the teaching aspects of the problem so I ask it in the following form. An anecdote. Years ago, when I was a high school teacher, I used to introduce real numbers showing first that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational and that there are infinitely many algebraic numbers of the same type. Then I used to add (obviously without any proof) that there are other numbers, such as $\pi, e, 2^{\sqrt{2}}$ (said transcendental ) that are not algebraic.  All of these new numbers have a non periodic representation and, added to the rationals, form the set of real numbers. To taste the beauty of mathematics, I  was then used to sketch the Cantor's diagonal proof, to show that the real numbers are much more numerous than the rationals and form a set called continuous . Once a student asked me if  were the transcendental numbers (as $\pi, e ...$) that make the set of reals continuous. I was a bit uncomfortable and I thought about it for a while  before I gave an answer; finally the answer was: NO, we don't really know the numbers that make the reals continuous because those numbers are not computable. The student was a bit astonished by that answer and he commented that mathematics was not such an exact knowledge as he hoped. After that day I was convinced that students have to be exposed with caution to the mysteries of real numbers. Now the question. What is the minimal extension of the rational field that we need to teach (and learn) the calculus at a beginner level? My guess is that  is enough an exponential extension $\mathbb{E} / \mathbb{A}$ of the algebraic numbers field $\mathbb{A}$ considered as a subfield of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ and constructed as in Exponential extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ $. As shown in that post, such a field is countable and all its elements are obviously computable.
As far as I know, we don't know if $e$ is an element of that field, but however if we add it to $\mathbb{A}$  (possibly with some other helpful transcendent numbers) the field closure is anyway countable and its exponential estension is entirely computable.","['education', 'calculus', 'soft-question', 'real-numbers']"

1083875,Uniform continuity of scalar multiplication in topological vector spaces,"If $X$ and $Y$ are topological vector spaces over $\mathbb R$, then a map $f:X\to Y$ is called uniformly continuous if for each neighborhood $V\subseteq Y$ of $0\in Y$, there exists a neighborhood $W\subseteq X$ of $0\in X$ such that for any $x,y\in X$ satisfying $x-y\in W$, it follows that $f(x)-f(y)\in V$. It is not difficult to show that addition $+:X\times X\to X$ is a uniformly continuous function when $X\times X$ is endowed with the product topology. Also, for a given $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, the map $x\mapsto \alpha x$ is a uniformly continuous function from $X$ to $X$. However, I suspect that scalar multiplication $\cdot:\mathbb R\times X\to X$ is not necessarily uniformly continuous when $\mathbb R$ is endowed with the usual topology and $\mathbb R\times X$ is endowed with the product tvs structure. Indeed, if $X=\mathbb R$ under the usual topology, then the function $(\alpha,x)\mapsto \alpha x$ from $\mathbb R^2$ to $\mathbb R$ is clearly not uniformly continuous. Can anybody confirm this? I'm asking because several textbook references on topological vector spaces claim that both addition and multiplication are uniformly continuous functions, but I suspect uniform continuity of scalar multiplication can only be established in a restricted sense, i.e. , when it is interpreted for a given scalar and not when $\mathbb R$ is considered as a tvs in its own right to be multiplied with $X$ to form a product tvs. In particular, I'm confused as to which of these two notions of “scalar multiplication” is appropriate when one is talking about the uniform continuity of such an operation.","['general-topology', 'vector-spaces', 'continuity', 'functional-analysis']"

1084041,Evaluating $\int_0^\infty \sqrt{\frac{x}{e^x-1}}dx$ in terms of special functions,"Introduction: I've been studying integrals of the form $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^a}{(e^x-1)^b}dx$$ where a and b are real parameters.

I then thought of generalizing this to the case where both a and b are non-integers. As a start I considered the integral $$\int_0^\infty \sqrt\frac{x}{e^x-1}dx$$ Using substitution methods and integration by parts I deduced that $$\int_0^\infty \sqrt\frac{x}{e^x-1}dx=\int_1^\infty \frac{\sqrt{\ln x}}{x\sqrt{x-1}}dx=\int_0^1 \sqrt\frac{-\ln x}{x(1-x)} dx=2\sqrt2\int_0^1 \sqrt\frac{-\ln x}{1-x^2}dx$$ $$=\sqrt2\int_0^1 \frac{\arcsin x}{x\sqrt{-\ln x}}dx=\sqrt2\int_0^\infty \frac{\arcsin(e^{-x})}{\sqrt x} dx=2\sqrt2\int_0^\infty \arcsin(e^{-x^2})dx$$ $$=2\sqrt2\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \sqrt{-\ln(\sin x)} dx$$ I tried different methods on each integral but pretty much nothing worked. With each method not shown here the integral got much more complicated. The last integral looks similar to the Clausen's integral but I wasn't able to establish a relation between them.

All of these $x^2$ values are equally likely, because their corresponding $x$ values were.

1084103,Every natural number is representable as $\sum_{k=1}^{n} \pm k^5$ ... if somebody proves it for 240 integers,"(This post is inspired by "" Is every $\mathbb{N}$ representable as $\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \pm k^3$ ""? My question is at the end.) The problem of whether every natural number $N$ is, $$N=\sum_{k=1}^n \pm k^p$$ in an infinite number of ways may be reduced to finding polynomial identities and checking a finite number of cases. (The background can be found in Dumitrescu and Xu's paper , but the identities here are new.) For $p=5$, it can be shown this reduces to merely checking all integers $0\leq N<240$ . Details: $\color{blue}{\text{I.}\;p = 3:}$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{10}s_n\big(x+n)^3-\sum_{n=1}^{10}s_{11-n}\big(x+n+10\big)^3
= 6\tag1$$ for the ten $s_n = 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1$. As the paper points out, what remains is to show that all $0\leq N<6$ is a sum of cubes, which is indeed the case. Note : This is more symmetrical and uses only $20$ addends, whereas the paper uses $28$ addends. $\color{blue}{\text{II.}\;p = 4:}$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{20}a_n\big(x+n)^4+\sum_{n=1}^{20}a_{21-n}\big(x+n+20\big)^4 = 192$$ where $a_n =-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1$. $$\sum_{n=1}^{20}b_n\big(x+n)^4+\sum_{n=1}^{20}b_{21-n}\big(x+n+20\big)^4 = 480$$ where $b_n =-1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1$. Since $\text{GCD}(192,\,480) = 96$, we can combine these two into one
  with sum $96$. Let $\alpha=-2,\beta=1$, and $192\alpha+480\beta=96(2\alpha+5\beta)=96$, so we use the first sequence ${2\times,}$ and subtract it with the second sequence $1\times,$ to get, $$\sum_{n=1}^{120}c_n(x+n)^4 = 96\tag2$$ where $c_n = \text{-Flatten[{a, Reverse[a], a, Reverse[a], -b, -Reverse[b]}]}$, in Mathematica . Note: This uses only $(40\times2)+(40\times1)=120$ addends, whereas the paper uses $136$. (The authors then show that all $0\leq N<96$ can be decomposed into fourth powers.) $\color{blue}{\text{III.}\;p = 5:}$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{20}u_n\big(x+n)^5-\sum_{n=1}^{20}u_{21-n}\big(x+n+20\big)^5 = 1668000$$ where $u_n = -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1$. $$\sum_{n=1}^{24}v_n\big(x+n)^5-\sum_{n=1}^{24}v_{25-n}\big(x+n+24\big)^5 = 1509120$$ where $v_n = 1, -1, -1,1, -1, -1,1,1,1, -1, 1, 1,1,-1, -1, -1, -1,1, -1,-1,1,1,-1, 1$. Since $\text{GCD}(1668000,\,1509120) = 480$, we can also combine these. Let $\alpha=19,\beta=-21$, and $1668000\alpha + 1509120\beta=480 (3475\alpha + 3144\beta) =480$, so we use the first sequence $19\times,$ and subtract it
  with the second sequence $21\times,$ to get, $$\sum_{n=1}^{1768}w_n(x+n)^5 = 480\tag3$$ where $(40\times19) + (48\times21)=1768$. (The explicit sequence $w_n$ is
  too tedious to include.) Note : The very first version of this post had an identity for $p=5$ with more than $70000$ addends. But it can be reduced to just $168$ given explicitly here . Question: For the remaining integers, anyone has an efficient computer code to show that, $$N=\sum\limits_{k=1}^n \pm k^5,\quad\text{where}\; 0\leq N<240$$ is indeed the case? ( P.S.

1084436,Two-leg games in Elo rating for football teams,"Do you know Elo rating for association football? It is a numerical estimation of strength of football clubs using simple mathematical formula based  past results allowing predictions for the future. If two teams play each other, the resulting change in points of one team is calculated as follows:
  $$ \Delta P = W \times \max (\sqrt{| G - G_{O}|}, 1) \times (R - \frac{1}{10^{\frac{-(P - P_{O} + V)}{400}} + 1})$$ where $\Delta P$ : The point that the team gets after the match. $W$ : Weight(significance) of the game. 0 for friendly matches, 20 for official matches, 40 for ""big"" games (such as World cup, ...) $G$ : Number of goals scored in the game by our team. $G_{O}$ : Number of goals scored in the game by the opponent. $R$ : Result of the game. 1 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0 for defeat. $P$ : Current point of our team, before the game. $P_{O}$ : Current point of the opponent, before the game. $V$ : Home advantage. 0 for neutral venue, 90 for domestic home game, -90 for domestic away game, 120 for international home game, -120 for international away game. For example: Real Sociedad (Spain) beat Real Madrid (Spain) 4-2 at their home. Before the game, the points of two teams were Real Sociedad 1752, Real Madrid 2081. 
After the game, Real Sociedad get $\displaystyle 20 \times \sqrt{2} \times (1 - \frac{1}{10^{\frac{-(1752+90-2081)}{400}} + 1}) = 22.5798$ points, Real Madrid lose $22.5798$ points. (As you notice, the rating is always zero-sum game) Chelsea (England, 1950 pts) beats Schalke (Germany, 1773 pts) 5-0 at the away game. 
Chelsea get $18.7248$ points, Schalke lose $18.7248$ points. Real Madrid (Spain, 2101 pts) beats Razgrad (Bulgaria, 1542 pts) 4-0 at their home. Real Madrid get $0.7869$ points, Razgrad lose $0.7869$ points. The formula is generally considered reasonable when it comes to single-leg games. However, the problem arises on two-leg games (such as UEFA Champions League knockout tournament): A team winning its first leg by a high margin can afford to lose the second leg by a narrow margin. Consider this real example: In 2013/14 UEFA Champions League quarterfinal game, Real Madrid (pts around 2050) beat Dortmund(pts around 1870) 3-0 at first-leg home game, and lost to Dortmund 0-2 at second-leg away game, but anyway qualified through semifinal with aggregate score 3-2. If we apply the formula to each two of games individually, then Real Madrid get 5.18 points in the first leg, and lost 17.15 points in the second leg, resulting total loss of 12.03 points. This is NOT PLAUSIBLE, because the eventual winner of the two-leg game was Real Madrid anyway. So, we have to apply the formula in different manner for 2nd-leg games in double-leg tournament matches. What I think that the new revised formula must satisfy is: What really matter is to qualify for the next round. Hence, if you qualify, the total change in the points throughout 2 games must be positive. If you fail to qualify, the total change must be negative. Winning/drawing/losing the second leg game also matters. If you win the first game 4-0 and lose the second game 3-0, then anyway you must lose some points in second game, but the amount of losing points should not exceed the amount of point you've gain in the first game (because we must satisfy the condition 1). The first leg should be considered as a standard game. I thought several cases: 1) First Win, Second Win : Just apply the formula as usual. I see no reason in changing that. 2) First Win, Second Draw (Eventual win) : First you get point, and second you get or lose point. If your team are considered as very strong, then your team would lost some points in second game, but the amount of point loss must be less than the amount of point gain. In terms of mathematics, $\Delta P_1 > 0$ and $\Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 > 0$. 3) First Win, Second Lose (Eventual Win, like 3-0 and 0-2, or away goal win) : $\Delta P_1 > 0$, $\Delta P_2 < 0$, $\Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 > 0$. 4) First Win, Second Lose (Eventual Lose, like 3-0 and 0-4, or away goal lose) : $\Delta P_1 > 0$, $\Delta P_2 < 0$, $\Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 < 0$. 5) First Draw, Second Win (Eventual Win) : $\Delta P_2 > 0$, $\Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 > 0$. 6) First Draw, Second Draw (Eventual Win, like away goal or penalty shootouts after extra time) : $\Delta P_1 + \Delta P_2 > 0$. Since the point system is zero-sum, these cases are all we need to consider. I'm struggling on making ideas about how to revise the formula for case 2)~6). Any talk would be appreciated.

1084444,Extending the set of algebraic numbers,"I have been trying to extend the countable set of algebraic numbers , by adding a countable amount of transcendental numbers (so that the resulting set is also countable). Now, of course I could simply add some transcendental number or numbers while keeping the resulting set countable, for example: $\pi$ All integer multiples of $\pi$ All rational multiples of $\pi$ All algebraic multiples of $\pi$ But I am looking for a more elaborate way to do it (let's leave the non-mathematical definition of ""elaborate"" aside for now, because it's not the main point in this context). In any case, I have finally managed to come up with what I believe to be a countable extension, but it left me with a few (practical as well as philosophical) questions. Consider the set of all the numbers that can be calculated using a formula which contains a finite amount of: Natural numbers The basic arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div$) The infinite-repetition operator (e.g., $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or $\prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}$ or continued-fraction ) In fact, we only need $\left[1,+,-,\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\right]$ but I would like to keep this definition easier to understand. In any case, this set contains all the algebraic numbers, as well an infinite amount of transcendental numbers (including $\pi$, $e$, etc). I'm pretty sure that this amount is countable, since we are using a finite amount of symbols in order to represent every element in the set, but I'm not sure how to prove it. From a philosophical point of view, it seems like the uncountable ""majority"" of real numbers are in fact values that we can never ""lay our hands on"" - some sort of ""unreachable numbers in another dimension"" (like particles that go undetected in every sensor that we could possibly build, if I may use metaphors here). My questions are: Is the set above indeed countable as I speculate? If no, then where did I go wrong claiming that it was? If yes, then: How can we prove it? What other research has been conducted on this? What is ""the mathematical point"" in declaring that there are uncountably many real numbers, when the uncountable part of them contains values that we can never describe in any conceivable manner? I have previously posted some of the insights above in response to this question (though I had them in mind before I bumped into it), which follows this question . The latter essentially asks the same thing that I am asking in the last section above, but without the context that I am providing here in order to ""justify"" it.

Edit 3: The story behind this mysterious curve:
In a closed system with two compartments A and B , exchanges of some element E occurs between these two compartments. A is finite while B is not. Flux from A to B ( Fab ) in one unit of time is a fraction of stock of E in A ( Fab = 0.001 * A ). Flux from B to A is a fraction of stock of E in B times the fraction of free “space” in A ( Fba = 0.1 * B * (Amax-A)/Amax ). Considering, at the start of simulation, that A = 0 and B = x , for x = 1:2000 , what is the value y of B at the equilibrium? (given Amax = 500 ) When B0 gets high enough, A is saturated and B_eq (y) increases as a linear function of B0 . Hence the idea of substracting B0 from B_eq . Which gives away my mysterious curve. Edit 4: The reproducible R code behind: Amax <- 500 # max stock of element in solid phase

A0 <- 0 # stock of element in solid phase (A) at time zero

niequ <- 1000   # time allowed for reaching equilibrium between A and B

1084785,A man who lies a fourth of the time throws a die and says it is a six. What is the probability it is actually a six?,"First, I apologise for the vague title. I couldn't think of a short way to represent the problem. Also, I am aware that a similar question exists, but I have a little bit more insight. The problem is: A man is known to speak the truth three out of four times. He throws a
  die and reports that it is a six. Find the probability that it
  actually is a six. The answer in the book is $ \frac{3}{8} $, which sounds completely off to me, given the numbers, on first glance. I decided to try it on my own. After some contemplation, it indeed is true that $ \frac{3}{8} $ is correct. But, the question's vagueness makes it interesting. It's sort of a naive answer! First, here's the book's solution: Let $ E $ be the event that the man reports that a six occurs, $ S_1 $ be the event that six occurs and $ S_2 $ be the event that six does not occur. $ P(S_1) $ = Probability that six occurs = $ \frac{1}{6} $ $ P(S_2) $ = Probability that six does not occur = $ \frac{5}{6} $ $ P(E~|S_1) $ = Probability that the man reports that a six occurred when it has actually occurred (truth) = $ \frac{3}{4} $ $ P(E~|S_2) $ = Probability that the man reports that a six occurred when it hasn't actually occurred = $ \frac{1}{4} $ $ P(S_1|E) $ = Probability that a six has actually occurred when the man claims so = $$ \frac{P(S_1)~P(E~|S1)}{P(S_1)~P(E~|S_1)+P(S_2)~P(E~|S_2)} = \frac{3}{8} $$ Link to original: Page 25 of this (link updated 22/11/2015; tends to break often). Here's the first of my two solutions: The question is a little vague and it doesn't tell us what the man says when he doesn't get a six. Assuming he lies every time he doesn't get a six (which is not quite what the question says), would bring up $ P(E~|S_2) $ to $ 1 $, which skyrockets $ P(lie) $ to $ \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6}.\frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{8} $. Also, $ P(E~|S_1) = \frac{3}{4} $ and $ P(E) = \frac{5}{6} + \frac{1}{6}.\frac{3}{4} = \frac{23}{24} $. This brings us to, $$ P(S_1|E) = \frac{P(S_1)P(E~|S_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{3}{23} = 13.04\% $$ Please note that I don't care about the sixes rolled when he lies about it being a six, because that condition is not applicable to the question. I'm very skeptical about my calculations! I decided to whip up a simple program and see what the probability distribution is for $$ \frac{Number~of~sixes~rolled~while ~saying~it's~a~six}{Number~of~dice~rolls} $$ Here's the result: Considering the book says $ P(E~|S_2) = \frac{1}{4} $, which is in essence is contradictory to the question, let's also consider the other possibility: It's even more vague in this scenario! If the man lies after any given roll, there is a $ \frac{1}{5} $ probability that he will lie about it being any other number. This creates a new branch at each lie, which splits into five. In this case, $$ P(E) = \frac{1}{6}.\frac{1}{4}.\frac{1}{5}.\frac{5}{1}+\frac{1}{6}.\frac{3}{4} =  \frac{1}{6} $$ $ P(E~|S_1) $ still remains $ \frac{3}{4} $, but $ P(E~|S_2) = \frac{1}{4}.\frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20} $. $$ P(S_1|E) = \frac{P(S_1)P(E~|S_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{3}{4} = 75\% $$ This seems like the more intuitive answer, and it is why I doubted the original answer in the first place. Given a truth probability of $ \frac{3}{4} $, there was no way that the probability of a six was $ 37.5\% $! The ambiguity of the question is what makes $ \frac{3}{8} $ wrong to me. Entirely out of curiosity, which answer fits best with the question and are these calculations correct or baloney?",['probability']

1084844,Cramer-Rao bound for a parameter that can take only a finite set of values,"My question is related to the bound on the variance of an estimation of a parameter that can take only a finite set of values. I copy and paste what is written on wikipedia to have a common starting point and give a first example related to a parameter belonging to a continuous set. Suppose $\theta$ is an unknown deterministic parameter which is to be estimated from measurements x, distributed according to some probability density function $f(x;\theta)$. The variance of any unbiased estimator $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ is then bounded by the reciprocal of the Fisher information $I(\theta)$: $\mathrm{var}(\hat{\theta})
\geq
\frac{1}{I(\theta)}$ $I(\theta) = \mathrm{E}
 \left[
  \left(
   \frac{\partial \ell(x;\theta)}{\partial\theta}
  \right)^2
 \right] = -\mathrm{E}\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \ell(x;\theta)}{\partial\theta^2} \right]$ and $\ell(x;\theta)=\log  (f(x;\theta))$ is the natural logarithm of the likelihood function and $\mathrm{E}$ denotes the expected value (over x). As a simple case we can consider the estimation of a constant $\theta \in \mathbf{R}$ in an AWGN system (Additive White Gaussian Noise). We measure $x=\theta+ \nu$ where $\theta$ is our constant and $\nu$ is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2_{\nu}$ It is a known result that given a set of $N$ measurements $x[n], n=[0,...N-1]$ in a situation that can be modelled as $x[n]=s[n;\theta]+\nu[n]$ where $\nu[n]$ is a set of i.i.d gaussian random variable $\sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\nu})$ the variance of the estimator is $\mathrm{var}(\hat{\theta})
\geq
\sigma^2_{\nu}(\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}(\frac{\partial s[n;\theta]}{\partial \theta})^2)^{-1}$ In this simple case the output of our ML estimator is simply $\hat{\theta}=x$
and the variance of the estimation is  $\sigma^2_{\nu}$ Now this is a simple case and the calculation of the derivative it's easy and we have only one measurement (N=1) $s[n,\theta]=\theta \rightarrow \frac{\partial s[n;\theta]}{\partial \theta}=1$ I finally concluded my introduction,sorry if it was boring. Now i introduce my question:
Suppose that you have a parameter that can take only a finite set of values.
For example only two values (-1,+1); $\theta \in$ {-1;+1} If i'd ask you to create an estimator for this parameter it would simply be a threshold detector: $x>0 \rightarrow \hat{\theta}=+1$ $x<0 \rightarrow \hat{\theta}=-1$ We can also evaluate the variance of this estimator. But what about a general theoretical minimum variance for an estimator of a parameter that can take only a finite set of values? In this case the concept of derivative does not hold since it does not exist:
$\frac{\partial s[n;\theta]}{\partial \theta}$ cannot be calculated as the limit of the variation of the function $x[n;\theta]$ as the increment of $\theta$ goes to zero. Is it something known in literature? Do i have to switch to a different kind of calculus such as quantum calculus?

The sequence is similar to the Look-and-say sequence , but using the prime factors (in increasing order) of the previous term for the current. When the current term is prime, the sequence stops. For example, if the first term is 15, you get: 15       = one 3, one 5  (1 3 1 5)
1315     = one 5, one 263 (1 5 1 263)
151263   = two 3s, five 7s (2 3 5 7)
2357     = prime, stop sequence So, starting with 15 gives a four-term series. Starting with any prime gives a one-term series. Additionally, if a sequence revisits a number, it stops (counting the revisited number only once). I don't know if there are any cyclic sequences, but that's there to prevent it. Each number I've tried so far (manually) eventually terminates, but I'm not confident that it holds for any starting term. Is there any simple insight I'm missing that would show (or disprove) that for every (positive) starting number the sequence will be finite?

But such fractions are well-defined and I'm failing to see anything wrong with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ - in fact, IMO it is simpler than $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ because 1 is simpler than 2 (or similarly, because the former can trivially be rewritten without a fraction). So why does this bias against roots in the denominator exist and what is its justification? The only reason I can think of is that the bias is a relic of a time before the reals were understood well enough for mathematicians to be comfortable dividing by irrationals, but I have been unable to find a source to corroborate or contradict this guess.","['fractions', 'algebra-precalculus', 'soft-question']"

Proof Say $f$ has infinite many poles in $K$. Consider the series $(z_n)_n$ of different poles in $K$. Since $K$ is compact this series has a convergent subseries which converges to a $\color{red}{(1)}$ certain $z_0\in K$.

It seems intuitive that both of these tilings also apply on a torus. Is it the case that anything that maps 1-to-1 to a plane surface has a ""complete"" tiling with regular polygons? It seems like I should be able to tile hexes over a torus, and even over the sphere; although this seems like an edge case, since it's not 'on' the sphere except with a certain granularity and so on. I saw a Buckminster Fuller house the other days and have been wondering about this. I will try to spell out the sense of the one-to-one mapping requirement a bit more clearly. Can I tile any surface homeomorphic to the plane? To what degree are constraints around gluing edges together the same as those for performing a tiling? It seems plausible to me that tiling is at least somewhat independent of homeomorphicity -- for instance I can imagine that there could be certain constructions permitting smooth tiling even over particularly awkward edges. (That is to say it seems possible that tiling properties don't need to have quite the same ""algebra"" as proximity relations; that possibly a slightly different homeomorphic relation is required?) I note that on further reflection it seems like I'm conflating two tiling strategies in the first graph. The first being an 'internal' tiling, i.e., drawing on the actual surface. The second style being an 'approximation' tiling (like the way the Bucky house approximates a sphere with hexagonal tiles.) I hope this clarifies somewhat: that is, the question is whether the first kind of tiling is 'limited' to manifolds homeomorphic to the plane. Some assumptions that might help clarify my intent: By tiling I mean the isometric ""filling"" of a surface by compact tiles; and in particular I am concerned with the case of simple polygonal tilings, e.g., quadrilaterals and hexagons By surface I think I mean a 2-d Riemannian manifold (at any rate: I am particularly curious about the cases of the torus, cylinder and 2-sphere)","['general-topology', 'noneuclidean-geometry', 'tiling']"
