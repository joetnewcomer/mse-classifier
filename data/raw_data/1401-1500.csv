9502,solving a univariate equation with a sum of exponentials,"I am interested in a method to find the roots of the following equation: \begin{equation}
f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i e^{\beta_i t} + \gamma t + \delta = 0.

In particular I am interested in the smallest positive real root of $f$. For those interested, this equation arises when attempting to compute the point of intersection between the solution to the linear ODE \begin{align}

9508,"Looking for a bijective, discrete function that behaves as chaotically as possible","I need to write a coupon code system but I do not want to save each coupon code in the database. (For performance and design reasons.) Rather I would like to generate codes subsequent that are watermarked with another code. They should like kind of fancy and random. Currently they look like this: 1: AKFCU2, 2: AKFDU2, 3: AKFDW2, 4: AKHCU2, 5: AKHCW2, ..., 200: CLFSU2, 201: CLFSW2, ... It's obvious that subsequent codes look very similar as I just converted my code ingredients (the watermark and the integer in the front) to binary base and permutated the order by a fixed scheme. But to prevent people to easily guess another valid code or even accidently enter another valid code (thus making another code invalid by using it) I would prefer something more chaotic, like this: 1: FIOJ32, 2: X9NIU2, 3: SIUUN7, 4: XTVV4S, ... In the end the problem is to find a bijective, discrete function on the domain {0,1}^27 (or alternatively {0,1,2,3,4, ..., [10^(8.5)]}) that is far away from being continuous. Also it should be as simple as possible to implement. (EDIT: I also need to implement the reverse function.)

9510,Optimal yarn balls,"Winding yarn into a ball suggests some mathematical questions: Under some natural model, what paths should the yarn follow to achieve the most dense ball?
One model is that used by Henryk Gerlach and Heiko von der Mosel in their paper
""On sphere-filling ropes"" arXiv:1005.4609v1 (math.GT) .
(This is the same model I suggested in a MO question .)
I expect it would be difficult to extend the optimal solutions of the above paper to the multiple layers for a ball of yarn. (Below is shown part of Fig.6 from their paper.) What paths should the yarn follow to achieve the least dense ball?
Here I imagine layers forming a grid that suspends the yarn above as much empty space as possible. Random winding.
Typical instructions for how to do this by hand say, ""Change directions every once in a while while you are winding,"" or ""As you wrap, slowly rotate the ball counterclockwise to keep the distribution even."" What density is achieved by random winding? I ask these questions primarily out of curiosity. Perhaps there is an analogous process (winding the interior of a golf ball or baseball?) that has been studied mathematically.",['geometry']
9513,How to find a bijection between R-valued points of X and local ring homomorphisms?,"I am trying to prove the following fact for a homework assignment in algebraic geometry: Let R be a local ring, and X a prescheme. Show that there is a one-one correspondence between R-valued points on X and pairs (x, g) of points x on X and local homomorphisms $g: O_{X, x} \to R$. Now, given f: Spec R -> X, and writing x for f(M) where M is the maximal ideal of R, the induced map on stalks gives us a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R_M = R$. Then it remains to show that given a point x of X and a map $g: O_{X,x} \to R$, that there is a map f: Spec R -> X such that f(M) = x and such that the induced map is g. I haven't had any luck yet with associating a map f with a given g. Here are my thoughts and some of the things I've tried: When R is a field, then Spec R has only a single point, and thus the map f is completely determined by where it sends the zero ideal. This induces a local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, which is to say that it induces a map from $O_{X,x} / M_x \to k$ since the maximal ideal $M_x$ of $O_{X,x}$ is contained in the kernel of the local homomorphism. Anyway, as long as there is some local homomorphism from $O_{X,x}$ to k, then the map f sending (0) to x is a well-defined morphism. Now, when R is again just a local ring, it seems unlikely that f is completely determined by where it sends M, and I can't see how to work with this. I've tried extending the map g to a map of sheaves, thinking that maybe from there I'd be able to find my map of preschemes. But here I get a little lost, and I'm not sure how to make it work. We know a lot about the topology of Spec R, and this forces some properties of X. For example, the only open neighborhood of M in Spec R is the whole space. Therefore, f(Spec R) covers any open neighborhood of f(M). I haven't pursued this way very far yet, as it seems a little further afield. I just need a little hint to get me going again -- I've been thinking about this one for a while and I can't seem to get unstuck.",['algebraic-geometry']

9523,"Proof that $\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint f'(z)/f(z) \, dz = n$","My text gives a much more complicated proof of this result, which makes me wonder if the argument I have in my head for this has something wrong with it.  Does this work, or have I made a bad assumption somewhere along the line? Let $U \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be open, $\overline{D}(z_0, r) \subset U$, and $f : U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ be holomorphic with a zero of order $n$ at $z_0$ and no other zeroes in $U$. Taking a power series expansion at $z_0$,
$$f(z) = a_n(z-z_0)^n + o((z-z_0)^{n+1}).$$
Differentiating,
$$f'(z) = n a_n(z-z_0)^{n-1} + o((z-z_0)^n),$$
so we have
$$\lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{(z-z_0) f'(z)}{f(z)} = \lim_{z \rightarrow z_0} \frac{n a_n(z-z_0)^n + o((z-z_0)^{n+1})}{a_n(z-z_0)^n + o((z-z_0)^{n+1})} = n.$$
Define the function $g : U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ by
$$g(z) = \begin{cases}
(z-z_0) f'(z)/f(z) & \text{if } z \neq z_0 \\
n & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
By the Cauchy integral formula,
$$n = g(z_0) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial\overline{D}(z_0, r)} \frac{g(z)}{z - z_0}  dz =  \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial\overline{D}(z_0, r)} \frac{(z-z_0)f'(z)}{(z-z_0)f(z)} dz=  \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\partial\overline{D}(z_0, r)} \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz$$

9524,Motivating infinite series,"What are some good ways to motivate the material on infinite series that appears at the end of a typical American Calculus II course? My students in this course are generally from biochemistry, computer science, economics, business, and physics (with a few humanities folks taking the course for fun) - not just math majors. I have struggled some in the past to motivate the infinite series material to these students.  For one, it doesn't fit with the rest of Calc II, which is on the integral.  Over the years I have ""converged"" on telling them that the main point of the unit is Taylor series and that the rest of the material is there primarily so that we have the tools we need in order to understand Taylor series.  Then I illustrate some of the many uses of Taylor series (mainly function approximation, at this level).  This approach works better than anything I've come up with thus far with respect to getting my students to care about infinite series, but I feel a little like I'm selling the rest of the material short by subordinating it to Taylor series.  Does anyone have other ways of motivating infinite series that they would like to share?  (Again, only a small percentage of the students in my class are math majors.) Background: The material in this unit typically consists of sequences, basic series (like geometric and telescoping ones), a slew of tests for convergence (e.g., integral test, ratio test, root test), an introduction to power series, Taylor and Maclaurin series, and maybe binomial series.","['sequences-and-series', 'education', 'calculus']"

The idea is like this Let $f:X\to Y$ is a mapping, where $X$ is a complete metric space (not sure if its strictly needed or whether a looser condition would do). If $f$ is a continuous mapping then $f$ is uniquely specified by a mapping $g:E\to Y$ where $E$ is a dense subset of $X$.

9540,Does order isomorphism of linear extensions of two partially ordered sets imply order isomorphism of themselves?,"This question was firstly posted on Mathoverflow . Two answers are pretty interesting. The potential counter-example given in the second answer is really interesting, but it is not surely a counter-example. Consider two partially ordered sets $A = \{a< b,a< c\}$, $B=\{x< z,y< z\}$. Their linear extensions (here we allow equality in linear extensions) for $A, B$ are 
$A_L=\{A_1=\{a< b< c\}, A_2=\{a< b= c\}, A_3=\{a< c< b\}\}$
and
$B_L = \{ B_1 = \{x< y< z\}, B_2=\{y< x< z\}, B_3 =\{x= y< z\}\}$ We may define $f_1: A_1\to B_1$ by $f_1(a)=x, f_1(b)=y, f_1(c)=z$ and $f_2:A_3\to B_2$ by $f_2(a)=y, f_2(b)=x, f_2(c)=z$, but there are no bijective mappings from $A_2$ to $B_3$ s.t. $t< s\Longleftrightarrow f_3(t)< f_3(s)$ and $t=s \Longleftrightarrow f_3(t)=f_3(s)$.  (And it's easy to see that no other pairing of the $A_i$ with the $B_j$ will allow such maps to be chosen.) There are no order isomorphisms from $A$ to $B$, either. Is the following conjecture true? For any partially ordered sets $A,B$, if there exist isomorphisms from $A$'s linear extensions to $B$'s, then there exists an isomorphism from $A$ to $B$.

9592,Card shuffling to Even Decks,"I have an interesting math question I've developed while playing cards with my family and wonder if anyone has a way to approach the problem. Say I have n people who each have a deck of cards. Each deck has a different number of cards in it. We are shuffling the cards for a game and in the end we all want to have the same number of cards to shuffle. Each individual can do one of two actions per round of shuffling. They can shuffle their deck, or they can split their deck in half and swap one half of their deck with half of another person's deck. My question is, is there an equation based on n to describe a method of swapping that will eventually give all n players the same amount of cards? Furthermore, how many rounds does it take? (In my mind, I define a round as a period of time where everyone performs one action. A player can only perform one action per round and the round ends when all players have performed one action) To make the problem simpler, you can assume that each individual can only do one action: split their deck and swap with any other player. The problem is trivial when n is a power of 2. For example if we have 2 people, they split their decks, swap, and they have the same number of cards. It takes one round. For 4 people, you split them into 2 groups of 2 people and perform the swap internally in the group. Then you make 2 groups with one person from each group in round one and have them swap. This takes 2 rounds. I would like to see if there is an simple elegant solution when n is not a power of 2. (You can also assume that each deck splits evenly every time, which is a big assumption but should give a good basis for how to solve the problem. A similar problem would be to replace the cards with cups of liquid which gets rid of passing half of cards around.)","['combinatorics', 'number-theory']"

As a reminder: Amicable numbers are two different numbers so related that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.

9648,A particular case of the quadratic reciprocity law,"To motivate my question, recall the following well-known fact: Suppose that $p\equiv 1\pmod 4$ is a prime number. Then the equation $x^2\equiv -1\pmod p$ has a solution. One can show this as follows: Consider the following polynomial in ${\mathbb Z}_p[x]$: $x^{4k}-1$, where $p=4k+1$. The roots of this polynomial are precisely the elements of ${\mathbb Z}_p^*$, each one with multiplicity 1. The polynomial factors as $(x^{2k}-1)((x^k)^2+1)$, and it follows that if $a$ is any element of ${\mathbb Z}_p^*$ with $a^{2k}\ne 1$ (and there are precisely $(p-1)/2$ possible such $a$), then $b=a^k$ satisfies $b^2\equiv -1\pmod p$.

9792,The $n$-shortest lattice vectors problem in $\mathcal{R}^2$,"I am looking for an algorithm to compute the $n$ shortest lattice vectors in $\mathcal{R}^2$. The problem statement is as follows: Given a lattice $L: \{ m \vec{u}+n\vec{v} \} \in \mathcal{R}^2$, a norm $\left\lVert\cdot\right\rVert$, and an integer $N>0$, compute a set of $N$ shortest lattice vectors $S$ such that if $\vec{x}\in S$, then for all $\vec{y} \notin S$, $\left\lVert\vec{y}\right\rVert \ge \left\lVert\vec{x}\right\rVert$. One may assume that $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are reduced basis vectors returned from Gauss' algorithm. Ideally, the algorithm can take an existing $S$ and expand it by adding in the next ""ring"" of vectors with the next greatest norm. I have a rough idea of how to go about doing this for the Euclidean norm; you can move along the perimeter of the already-found vectors and add in new vectors of minimal norm, but I am wondering if it is possible to generalize this to any norm. Even generalizing to $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ norms would be good. Edit : Description of my algorithm for the $L_2$ norm. The algorithm seeks to find the next ring of points with the next largest norm (radius from the origin) given an existing ring. We accomplish this by scanning along the ""perimeter"" of the existing ring, in only one of the dimensions since the other length in the other dimension is roughly known based on the equation of a circle. Assume you are given the reduced lattice basis vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, integer coefficients $(a,b)$ such that $a \vec{u} + b\vec{v}$ is one of the points on the existing ring of radius $r$. Determine the maximum extent we need to scan in the $\vec{u}$ direction:
Compute $m>0$ such that $\left\lVert m\vec{u}+n\vec{v} \right\rVert = r$ has no solution for any $n$. This is a simple quadratic equation. Round $m$ away from zero by one to be safe. The amount of time it will take to complete the scan is proportional to $m$. Initialize $r_b = \infty$, the radius of the best next candidate ring. Initialize the set $S$ of next ring points to empty. For each $i$ in $-m \le i \le m$, determine $j$ so that $r_c = \left\lVert i\vec{u}+j\vec{v} \right\rVert > r$. If $r_c \lt r_b$, then we found an even smaller ring: set $r_b = r_c$ and set $S = \{i,j\}$. Otherwise if $r_c = r_b$ we found another point on the ring and add $\{i,j\}$ to $S$. Otherwise, if $r_c \gt r_b$, do nothing. A little thought should convince you that this works. This only works for the $L_2$ norm since it explicitly makes use of the shape of the equi-norm contours. For a general norm, the shape is not known ahead of time.","['geometry', 'integer-lattices', 'computational-geometry', 'algorithms']"

9825,Does this property characterize a space as Hausdorff?,"As a result of this question , I've been thinking about the following condition on a topological space $Y$: For every topological space $X$, $E\subseteq X$, and continuous maps $f,g\colon X\to Y$, if $E$ is dense in $X$, and $f$ and $g$ agree on $E$ (that is, $f(e)=g(e)$ for all $e\in E$), then $f=g$. If $Y$ is Hausdorff, then $Y$ satisfies this condition. The question is whether the converse holds: if $Y$ satisfies the above condition, will it necessarily be Hausdorff? If $Y$ is not at least $T_1$, then $Y$ does not have the property: if $u,v\in Y$ are such that $u\neq v$ and every open neighborhood of $u$ contains $v$, then let $X$ be the Sierpinski space, $X=\{a,b\}$, $a\neq b$, with topology $\tau=\{\emptyset,\{b\},X\}$, $E=\{b\}$, let $f,g\colon X\to Y$ be given by $f(a)=f(b)=v$, and $g(a)=u$, $g(b)=v$. Then both $f$ and $g$ are continuous, agree on the dense subset $E$, but are distinct. My attempt at a proof of the converse assumes the Axiom of Choice and proceeded as follows: assume $Y$ is $T_1$ but not $T_2$; let $u$ and $v$ be witnesses to the fact that $Y$ is not $T_2$, let $\mathcal{U}\_s$ and $\mathcal{V}\_t$ be the collection of all open nbds of $s$ that do not contain $t$, and all open nbds of $t$ that do not contain $s$, respectively. Construct a net with index set $\mathcal{U}\_s\times\mathcal{V}\_t$ (ordered by $(U,V)\leq (U',V')$ if and only if $U'\subseteq U$ and $V'\subseteq V$) by letting $y_{(U,V)}$ be a point in $U\cap V$ (this is where AC comes in). Let $E=\{y_{(U,V)}\mid (U,V)\in\mathcal{U}\_s\times\mathcal{V}\_t\}$, and let $X=E\cup\{s\}$. Give $X$ the induced topology; let $f\colon X\to Y$ be the inclusion map, and let $g\colon X\to Y$ be the map that maps $E$ to itself identically, but maps $s$ to $t$. The only problem is I cannot quite prove that $g$ is continuous; the difficulty arises if I take an open set $\mathcal{O}\in \mathcal{V}_t$; the inverse image under $g$ is equal to $((\mathcal{O}\cap X)-\{t\})\cup\{s\}$, and I have not been able to show that this is open in $X$. So: Does the condition above characterize Hausdorff spaces? If not, I would appreciate a counterexample. If it does characterize Hausdorff, then ideally I would like a way to finish off my proof, but if the proof is unsalvageable (or nobody else can figure out how to finish it off either) then any proof will do. Added: A little digging turned up  this question raised in the Problem Section of the American Mathematical Monthly back in 1964 by Alan Weinstein. The solution by Sim Lasher gives a one paragraph proof that does not require one to consider $T_1$ and non-$T_1$ spaces separately.","['general-topology', 'separation-axioms']"

There are two possible ways of combining these two data sets: 
 (1) a1+b1 and a2+b2 which results in values of 5 and 2, and 
 (2) a1+b2 and a2+b1 which results in values of 3 and 4.

possible of 3. Ergo, the 3rd highest value possible from 
 a data set of a{3,2,1} and b{4,3,0} is a1+b3=3. 
There are six possible ways of combining these two data sets: 
(1) a1+b1 followed by a2+b2  and a3+b3, which results in values of 7, 5 and 1, and

We all know that $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$ converges for $s>1$ and diverges for $s \leq 1$ (Assume $s \in \mathbb{R}$). I was curious to see till what extent I can push the denominator so that it will still diverges. So I took $\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n\log n}$ and found that it still diverges. (This can be checked by using the well known test that if we have a monotone decreasing sequence, then $\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} a_n$ converges iff $\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} 2^na_{2^n}$ converges). No surprises here. I expected it to diverge since $\log n$ grows slowly than any power of $n$. However, when I take $\displaystyle \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(\log n)^s}$, I find that it converges $\forall s>1$. (By the same argument as previous). This doesn't make sense to me though.

It is relatively easy to prove this. $\textbf{My question is there a counting argument to prove that this is an integer?}$ By this, I mean does $\frac{(30n)!n!}{(15n)!(10n)!(6n)!}$ count something?

The question here is which resource should he prefer to maximize the chance of survival. I tried to find out if there already established measures of such sort, but so far without success. Some thoughts led me to the following measure of the resource' value: $$V=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} e^{\int_0^t \log (p_1(u))du}\log \frac{p_1(t)}{p_0(t)} dt$$ where $p_0(t)$ is the probability density of survival without the resource, $p_1(t)$ is the probability density of survival with the resource and $(t_0,t_1)$ is the period of time through which the resource affects the probability of survival (the time for which the value is evaluated considered t=0) I would like to know if there any similar measures already proposed and about the possible drawbacks of this proposed value.

9993,Summing divergent series based on physics,"Solving a heat equation with central symmetry i got the following result: The problem is to find a sphere center temperature vs. time given that the surface of the sphere is kept constant at $$T_1$$ and at initial moment t=0 the temperature inside the sphere is distributed uniformly with value $$T_0$$ A solution is following: $$T(t)=T_1+2 (T_0-T_1)\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} e^{-t(\frac{k\pi a}{r})^2}$$  
Here r is the radius of the sphere and a=const is a coefficient of thermal conductivity. Now the solution must satisfy the initial condition $$T(0)=T_0$$: $$T(0)=T_1+2 (T_0-T_1)\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} $$ This is satisfied only if the following holds: 1-1+1-1+1-1+ ... =1/2 So, we found this divergent sum  through physical arguments? Is this appropriate for the pure mathematician? Lets go a step further and differentiate the solution by t: $$\frac {d T(t)}{dt}=-2 (T_0-T_1)(\frac{\pi a}{r})^2\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} k^2 e^{-t(\frac{k\pi a}{r})^2}$$ Now, at initial moment t=0 we have: $$\frac {d T(0)}{dt}=-2 (T_0-T_1)(\frac{\pi a}{r})^2\sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k+1} k^2 $$ Obviously  $$\frac {d T(0)}{dt}=0$$  because  the maximum speed in the universe is limited.

Now I'm trying to prove that the torsion submodule of $\prod \mathbb{Z}_p$ is not a direct summand of $\prod \mathbb{Z}_p$. I found this interesting because it's an example that over a PID, a non-finitely generated module may fail to be decomposed as torsion $\oplus$ something free, showing even that it can't be decomposed as torsion $\oplus$ anything. Now, it is easily proven that the torsion submodule of $\prod \mathbb{Z}_p$ is $\bigoplus \mathbb{Z}_p$. So if we could decompose $\prod \mathbb{Z}_p$ as torsion $\oplus$ something it would have to be $\prod \mathbb{Z}_p = \bigoplus \mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \frac{\prod \mathbb{Z}_p}{\bigoplus \mathbb{Z}_p}$ (this is correct, right?)

10233,Uses of quadratic reciprocity theorem,"I want to motivate the quadratic reciprocity theorem, which at first glance does not look too important to justify it being one of Gauss' favorites. So far I can think of two uses that are basic enough to be shown immediately when presenting the theorem: 1) With the QRT, it is immediate to give a simple, efficient algorithm (that can be done even by hand) for computing Legendre symbols. 2) In Euler's proof of Fermat's claim on the conditions in which a prime $p$ is of the form $x^2+ny^2$ (for certain small values of $n$) the proof is reduced to finding the conditions under which $p$ divides $x^2+ny^2$ for some $x,y$, hence to the question under which conditions is $-n$ a quadratic residue modulo $p$, which leads immediately to the QTR (for example, for $n=3$, where we get that $p\equiv_3 1$). I really like this example since it begins with an ""historic"" problem and proceeds to ""discover"" the QTR through special cases (which is what Euler did in practice - see Cox's book on ""Primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$""). However, I am sure there are many more examples (and I'm especially curious as to how Gauss reached the theorem himself). I'd love to hear about them and receive references for further reading.","['applications', 'quadratic-reciprocity', 'motivation', 'number-theory']"
10255,Tractrix-like curves,"Is there a common name for curves, obtained from dragging a point along another curve, similar to how tractrix is obtained by dragging a point along a line? What is a parametric equation of such curve given the parametric equation of a curve along which the master goes?","['analytic-geometry', 'geometry', 'plane-curves', 'calculus']"
