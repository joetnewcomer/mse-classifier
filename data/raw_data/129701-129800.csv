2007570,Absolute values of complex irreducible characters of finite groups,"I had few questions on complex irreducible characters of finite groups which are mostly on their arithmetic nature. I will also mention here that I am considering only $\mathbb{C}$-irreducible characters of finite groups . If $\chi$ is an irreducible $\mathbb{C}$-character of a finite group $G$, then one can see that $|\chi(g)|\leq |G|$ for any $g\in G$. My question is about opposite side of this fact. To avoid triviality, we do not consider zero  character values. Question 1. Is there lower bound on $\{|\chi(g)|:g\in G\}\setminus \{0\}$? For second question, it is well known that character values are algebraic integers, and so are their absolute values (am I right?). But, absolute values are also real numbers. This forced me to consider the question: Question 2. Consider those real numbers which are absolute values of irreducible $\mathbb{C}$-characters of finite groups. Is this set dense in $\mathbb{R}$? The third question came because of the very basic property of characters. Question 3. Given any algebraic integer, does there exists a finite group which takes this value for some irreducible character? (In other words, does any algebraic integer sits in character table of some finite group?)","['finite-groups', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'characters']"
2007626,Normalisation using Softmax- What advantage does exponential provide,"I am trying to apply some bench marking across different organizations. I have 3 organizations with 3 scores using which I would like to relatively rank them. For e.g. Org 1 = 115, Org 2 = 105, Org 3= 50, then $\mathbf{x} = (115, 105, 50)$ I was told to try Softmax function \begin{equation}
\mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{e^{x_{i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{3}e^{x_{j}}}
\end{equation} as it normalizes the values. I could also normalize using \begin{equation}
\mathrm{standard~normalisation}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{x_{i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{3}x_{j}}

2007678,Proving that a vector field is conservative using only Green Theorem,"Consider a vector field $F: \mathbb{R}^2/\{\vec{0}\} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ $$F=(F_1(x,y),F_2(x,y))$$ $\mathbb{R}^2/\{\vec{0}\}$  is not a simply connected domain . Suppose also that $F$ is irrotational . Can the following procedure be valid to prove that $F$ is conservative? I find one closed curve $\gamma_1$ that goes around the origin and such that $$\oint_{\gamma_1} F \cdot ds=0$$
(assuming that such curve exists). If I consider any other closed curve $\gamma_2$ that goes around the origin, then I can use Green Theorem and see the union of $\gamma_2 \cup \gamma_1$ as the border of a regular domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. 
Let's say this domain is $D$: then its border is $\partial D=\gamma_1 \cup \gamma_2$. I have to choose the positive orientation for $\partial D$ but suppose that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ already have the right orientations in order to have $+\partial D$ (I think that this is not restrictive). Therefore I can finally say that: $$\oint_{+\partial D} F \cdot ds=\oint_{\gamma_1 \cup \gamma_2 } F \cdot ds=\oint_{\gamma_1  } F \cdot ds+\oint_{\gamma_2  } F \cdot ds= \int \int_{D} \partial_{x} F_2- \partial_{y} F_1=0$$ $$\implies \oint_{\gamma_1  } F \cdot ds=-\oint_{\gamma_2  } F \cdot ds$$
Since $F$ is irrotational. But $\oint_{\gamma_1} F \cdot ds=0$, therefore $$\oint_{\gamma_2  } F \cdot ds=0$$ This is valid for any curve $\gamma_2$ that goes around the origin. (indipendently from the fact that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are indeed oriented in the proper way to have $+\partial D$). For any curve $\gamma_3$ that does not go around the origin it is possible to find a subset $A \subset \mathbb{R}^2/\{\vec{0}\}$ simply connected such that $\gamma_3 \subset A$, and $F$ is irrotational, $F$ is conservative in $A$ and $$\oint_{\gamma_3} F \cdot ds=0$$ So in conclusion we have 
$$\oint_{\gamma} F \cdot ds=0 \,\,\, \forall \gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^2$$ and $F$ is conservative. Is the previous proof valid or are there any mistakes? I think it should be valid, but it looks strange because if it is, I would conclude that $F$ is conservative looking at one only curve $\gamma_1$, which seems a bit reductive I think?","['vector-fields', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'integration', 'vector-analysis']"

2007791,Characterise Abelian groups categorially,"I wonder if there is any way to characterise Abelian groups (in Grp ) in the language of category theory. This is so basic that I can't imagine that this is not possible, but I cannot think of a way how. One idea was to say a group is Abelian iff it is equal to its Abelianisation, but this does not work, because in order to define the Abelianisation we already need to know what Abelian groups are. Then I thought maybe requiring that all subgroups are normal would be enough, but this is not strong enough since there are non-Abelian groups with only normal subgroups. There's probably something I'm not thinking about. Would appreciate some input.","['category-theory', 'group-theory']"

2008128,Understanding the combinatorial argument for $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2} = 3 \binom{n+1}{4}$.,"I was playing around the expression for $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$, and I discovered that it equals $3\binom{n+1}{4}$. I couldn't come up with any combinatorial argument, but found various ones on this site. I'm trying to understand a particular one. In this comment , the user r9m gives the following combinatorial argument: A direct combinatorial interpretation of the factor $3$ can be obtained by counting number of parallelograms in a equilateral triangle with side length $(nâˆ’1)$ and tiled with $(nâˆ’1)^2$ equilateral triangles with side length $1$(like this ). Of course one way of counting is $\binom{\binom{n}{2}}{2}$. The other way is divide the parallelograms into $3$ cases (each parallelogram must have its diagonal parallel to one of the $3$ sides of the equilateral triangle) which is $3 \times \binom{n+1}{4}$. I'm having trouble understanding both parts of this argument. In particular, I cannot think of the things to choose from for both binomial coefficients. For the first half, what are the $\binom{n}{2}$ things, from which we need to choose $2$? I suspect that since a parallelogram is uniquely defined in this grid by its longer diagonal, they are the endpoints of the diagonal of a parallelogram. But there are some restrictions for choosing the endpoints of a diagonal: e.g. the line joining them cannot be parallel to any of the sides of the equilateral triangle. For the second half, I understand the factor of $3$, and counting parallelograms with their shorter diagonal parallel of a particular side. However, I cannot see a ""thing"" that exists $n+1$ times in this figure. I suspect $4$ is the number of vertices of a parallelogram, but what is $n+1$?","['combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorial-proofs']"

2008142,Characterising subgroups of PrÃ¼fer $p$-groups.,"In my recent study of Artinian modules I have been looking at PrÃ¼fer $p$-groups (which I will denote by $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ from now on). I am attempting to prove that $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ is an Artinian $\mathbb{Z}$-module which is not finitely generated. To do this I am trying to show that every proper non-trivial submodule of $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ is equal to $\left(\frac{1}{p^n}\mathbb{Z_{}}\right)/\mathbb{Z}$ for some $n$. I am using the following definition of $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$:
$$\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}=\left\{x\in \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\mid \exists n:p^nx=0 \right\}$$
I have read in several places, Atiyah & MacDonald Example 6.3 and Wikipedia to name a few, that the subgroups of $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ are of this form. This would demonstrate that $\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ is Artinian. However, I can't seem to find anywhere a proof or example showing why all the subgroups are of this form. I would like to understand this further, as it is not immediate to me that this would be the case, but my attempts to figure out why have so far been futile. I may be thinking too much and missing a simple explanation. I have looked at starting with an arbitrary subgroup $H$ such that $H\neq 0$ and $H\neq\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}$ and seeing if I can deduce anything from that. I got this far, but it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. I have also looked at Sylow's theorems, but I'm not sure if they will be any use to me as $|\mathbb Z_{p^\infty}|=\infty$ (unless I'm wrong about this!). I would be extremely grateful if anybody could offer a few hints here as I am slowly losing my sanity trying to figure it out!

2008267,Is it possible to quantify the quality of a probability estimator?,"Given a number of sources of probability estimates, what is the best way to quantify the ""best"" source.

I've been asked to clarify the specifics of the question, but my question is less about a specific solution and more that I'm interested in all the angles from which this problem is attacked. If I were pressed into providing specifics, I'd point to a pair of thoughts I've had about this. First, when I hear people say, ""I'm 30% sure that...."" or, ""There's only a 10% chance of that ever happening,"" I have wondered how you could gauge that person's skill at guessing probabilities. Clearly, I could collect a few hundred samples from that individual and see if the stuff he labels at 10% happens roughly 10% of the time, his 20s 20% of the time, 30s 30%, etc. But if the sample set is, say, a dozen different estimates covering the range from 0.0 to 1.0, how do you assess the quality of those estimates? This is a question that's been tickling the back of my mind for years. Second, I might be writing a genetic algorithm that will look at current, highly local, weather patterns and guess the probability of the wind switching to 15-20MPH between SW and NW. I have decades of historical data, taken every few minutes, to train with, but analyzing the fitness of an individual in the gene pool hinges on that individual's accuracy in guessing probabilities.","['machine-learning', 'statistics', 'estimation', 'probability']"

2008373,Cauchy's integral formula with high tech methods,"Using Stokes theorem there is particularly nice way to prove Cauchys theorem. If $U$ is a domain in $\mathbb{C}$ with (piecewise) smooth boundary $\Gamma$, then for all differentiable functions $g: \bar U \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ we have
$$
 \int_\Gamma g dz = \int_Ud(gdz)=\int_U \frac{\partial g}{\partial \bar z} d\bar z \wedge dz = 2i \int_U \frac{\partial g}{\partial \bar z} d\mathcal{L}^2
$$
(where $\mathcal{L}^2$ is the two dimensional Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}$). Consequently, if $g$ is holomorphic, then the line integral over $\Gamma$ vanishes. I want to know if this reasoning also gives rise to Cauchy's integral formula. How do I want to do this? For simplicity we assume that $0 \in U$ and want to prove that
$$
 f(0) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\Gamma \frac{f(z)}{z} dz.
$$
The function $z \mapsto \frac{1}{z}$ is locally integrable over $\mathbb{C}$ and  homogeneous of degree $-1$, hence it can be considered as a tempered distribution which is also homogeneous of degree $-1$. Since this distribution is holomorphic away from $0$, we conclude that $\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z}\frac{1}{z}$ has its support in $\{0\}$ and is homogeneous of degree $-2$. Consequently it is a multiple of the Dirac distribution at $0$, which we denote by $\delta$. Either by a computation or in anticipation of Cauchy's formula we may assume that
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z}\frac{1}{z} = \pi \delta
$$
To prove Cauchy's integral formula I want to perform the following computation: Let $f$ be holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $\bar U$, then (trusting our inner physicist) we see
$$
\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\Gamma \frac{f(z)}{z} dz = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_U\frac{\partial }{\partial \bar z}\left(\frac{f(z)}{z}\right)  d\mathcal{L}^2 = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_U f(z) \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar z}\frac{1}{z} d\mathcal{L}^2 = \int_U f(z)  \delta d\mathcal{L}^2 = f(0)
$$
Of course this is not rigorous, the main problem being that we are dealing with a tempered distribution, which we can only apply to Schwartz functions and not to holomorphic functions. My question is: Can we do this in a rigorous way, somehow using holomorphic functions as test functions? (In light of this question I read about hyperfunctions, which somehow seem to be related, but at a first glance the theory seemed to be quite extensive - too much to answer the question myself right now.

Prove that $E \subset X$ is Caratheodory measurable iff $ \mu^*(E)+ \mu^*(E^C) = \mu(X)$. Going in the forward direction is fairly easy. Assuming that E is Caratheodory measurable, we can just substitute X into $\mu^*(A) = \mu^*(A \cap E) + \mu^*(A \cap E^C) $, and then we note that the outer measure and the premeasure of X themselves would have the same value. The other direction is more difficult however.

2008709,Shape of spectrum of bounded linear operator on complex Banach space,"I was reading Kreyszigâ€™s Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications some time ago in which the author discusses bounded linear operators $T$ on complex Banach spaces $X$, proving results such as that the spectrum $\sigma(T)$ ($\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ such that $(T-\lambda I)^{-1}$ is not a bounded operator defined on a set dense in $X$) is closed and (using complex analysis ) that it is nonempty and has spectral radius $\sup{|\lambda\in\sigma|}=\lim_\limits{n\rightarrow\infty}{||T^n||^{\frac{1}{n}}}$ (where the norm of an operator is defined in the usual way as $||T||=\sup_\limits{||x||=1}{||Tx||}$). The use of complex analysis and bounding within a disk made me think for some reason of the Mandelbrot set and wonder whether there could exist a bounded linear operator whose spectrum â€˜happenedâ€™ to be the Mandelbrot set, and if so how it would be found. Specifically are there higher-order constraints on the shape of the spectrum of these operators? I could not think of any immediate way of doing the problem in reverse to try to define an operator whose resolvent would not exist at specified locations, or perhaps this is actually trivial (the book did not touch on this topic too deeply)? I could find nothing relevant when I searched for this sort of thing. Thus my question is the following: can bounded linear operators on complex Banach spaces have relatively arbitrary shapes in the complex plane and if not what are the constraints? Finally, within those constraints is it possible to find possible operators and Banach spaces (since we constrain neither) for given spectral shapes?","['functional-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'spectral-theory', 'operator-theory']"

then show that $f$ is continuous, but not $C^1$. I have tried solving it. The problem is, that if $\phi(x)=\sqrt{x}$, then $f$ would not be continuous (taking the path $y=2x$, and letting $x \rightarrow 0$ makes the limit $-\infty \neq 0$). Did I not understand the question properly? Is taking $\phi(x) = \sqrt{x}$ as a counter example a mistake? Is there some mistake with the problem? And if not, could I get some sort of hint on solving it, as I have tried a few methods, but I can't seem to solve it. Edit: I may have solved it, but I am not sure if it is correct.

&\leq |x| + |y| \\
&\leq 2\delta_m

2008784,What is the reasoning behind why the ratio test works?,"The ratio test says that, if we have the positive series $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n,$$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \dfrac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = L$ , then (1) if $L < 1$ , then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ is absolutely convergent; (2) if $L > 1$ , then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ is divergent; (3) if $L = 1$ , then the ratio test gives no information. I want to understand the reasons behind why and how this works, rather than just memorising formulae. I have attempted to reason about this theorem myself. It can be seen that we're taking the ratio between the second term in the series, $a_{n+1}$ , and the first term in the series, $a_n$ . This is exactly how one finds the common ratio in a geometric sequence ( $r = \dfrac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} )$ . We then take the limit of this ratio, which I assume is to find the relative rate of change between $a_{n+1}$ and $a_n$ . In which case, it is more effective to take the absolute value of the limit, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \begin{vmatrix}{ \dfrac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} }\end{vmatrix} = L$ . This seems analagous to how the limit comparison test theorem works. Therefore, I presume that, if $L < 1$ , then this implies that $a_n$ has a greater rate of change than $a_{n+1}$ , which implies that each successive term in the series is getting smaller, and so as we go to infinity, each successive term is converging towards $0$ . As such, the series should converge to some value. Analogously, I presume that, if $L > 1$ , then this implies that $a_{n+1}$ has a greater rate of change than $a_n$ , which implies that each successive term in the series is getting larger, and so as we go to infinity, the terms diverge towards infinity.

Daniel McLaury gave the following answer here . In general, if you want the map from cellular homology to singular homology, just notice that if you have a homology class represented by a cell then that cell's closure can be regarded as a singular simplex, so send the cell to itself. If you want to talk about simplicial homology here, probably the easiest way of thinking about things is to show that both cellular and simplicial homology are isomorphic to singular homology.

I am not getting that how come this result is possible ? [Editor's comment #1: The question makes sense, but the asker forgot to explain their notation - possibly because they have not been exposed to any alternatives (happens regrettably often when programmers and/or telecommunication majors are introduced to finite fields). Below please find an elaboration of my educated guess, JL.] Here the notation is using a common way of writing polynomials with binary coefficients as integers. We are working over the field $GF(2^3)$ aka $\Bbb{F}_8$ defined as $\Bbb{F}_2[\alpha]$, where $\alpha$ is a zero of an irreducible cubic. We then compactly represent an arbitrary element 
$$
z=a_0+a_1\alpha+a_2\alpha^2\in GF(8), \ a_0,a_1,a_2\in GF(2),
$$
as the sequence of bits
$$
z=a_2a_1a_0
$$
that is then (internally to the computer program) stored as the integer
$$
i(z)=(a_2a_1a_0)_2
$$
in base two. For example, the element $\alpha^2+\alpha$ is converted to $6$, because
$$
\alpha^2+\alpha=1\cdot\alpha^2+1\cdot\alpha^1+0\cdot\alpha^0=110_2=6.
$$ [Editor's comment #2: A popular choice is that $\alpha$ is a zero 
of the polynomial $x^3+x+1$. In other words, we have the equation
$$
\alpha^3+\alpha+1=0.
$$
Unless I made a mistake, the first component of the matrix product above matches with this minimal polynomial in the sense that the calculation
$$
1\cdot4+1\cdot5+6\cdot6=1\cdot\alpha^2+1\cdot(1+\alpha^2)+(\alpha+\alpha^2)^2=\alpha+1=3,$$

In another question asking the same for an equilateral triangle an answer is given generalizing this to a regular $n$-gon . I once extended the solution method of this answer to computing the proportion $p_3$ of a cube closer to the centre than the outside, by considering a $2\times2\times2$ cube centred at the origin and considering by symmetry only the square pyramid whose base is the side $y=1$ and apex is the origin $(0,0,0)$ and then further restricting this by requiring by symmetry $z>0$ and $x>z$ (the volume under consideration will then be $\frac{1}{48}$th of the cube). The integrand of our problem is then $\frac{1-x^2-z^2}{2}-x$ but the limits of the integration become more complex than the two-dimensional case, and the solution to the problem is now given (unless Iâ€™ve made an error) by: $$p_3=6\int_{0}^{\frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{2}}\int_{z}^{\sqrt{2-z^2}-1}\frac{1-x^2-z^2}{2}-x\;dx\;dz$$ where the upper limits of the integrations are found by solving $\frac{1-x^2-z^2}{2}=x$ and then $\sqrt{2-z^2}-1=z$ and the lower limits follow by the definition of the region we are integrating on; the factor of $6$ comes from dividing $48$ by $2^3$ (the volume of the whole cube). I once managed to integrate this by hand to: $$p_3=\frac{5}{4}-\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{8}+\frac{\pi}{4}$$ and Wolfram Alpha agrees giving $p_3\approx0.086841$. However, if we step this up to a 4-cube then the integral becomes correspondingly more complicated and I have no idea how to explicitly compute the resulting integral. I do not know how this method could possibly be extended easily either. My question is this: the problem of what proportion $p_n$ of an $n$-cube is closer to the centre than the periphery seems to be one that might have a simpler or deeper way of solving it (perhaps just because it can be stated so easily); is there an alternative solution method to just doing a brute force integration over the bounding region?

There is a hint that says 'use the fact that $\zeta^2+\zeta +1=0 $ where $\zeta $ is a cube root of unity'. The way I solved this was to recognise that the third derivative of the series was equal to the series itself. So I just solved a linear ODE of order 3 and then found the constants (and so the hint made sense - in a way). But I don't think the question was designed for me to do this and so I feel as though I'm missing something obvious that makes this problem very easy.

As I understand the question I only have to provide one z that satisfies this condition for each property. Assuming that is the case I found the following answers: The relation is: reflexive , since $z = 0$ satisfies $a - a = z \cdot p$ $^1$ symmetrical , since $a-b = z \cdot p \implies b - a = z \cdot p$  is true for $z = 0$ anti-symmetrical , since $ a- b = z \cdot p \land b-a = z \cdot p \implies a = b$ is true for $z = 0$ transitive , since $a-b = z\cdot p \land b -c = z\cdot p\implies a = c$ is true for $z = 0$ However, I think I commit some very basic fallacies, because I completely ignore p.

Then the commutator in $\pi_1 (M,x)$ is related to a period matrix via $$\int_{[\alpha,\beta]} \omega_1 \omega_2 = \det\left( \matrix{{\int_\alpha \omega_1,\int_\alpha \omega_2}\\{\int_\beta \omega_1 ,\int_\beta \omega_2}}\right).$$ I am struggling to prove this using the shuffle product/coproduct/path reversal formulas. Assuming I haven't made a calculation mistake, however, I believe it reduces to showing that $$\int_\alpha \omega_1\omega_2 + \int_\beta \omega_1\omega_2 + \int_\alpha \omega_2\omega_1 + \int_\beta\omega_2\omega_1 = 2\int_\alpha\omega_1\omega_1+2\int_\beta\omega_2\omega_2$$

I have three questions relating to this: 1) Can anybody provide a proof for this formula? I can't find one referenced anywhere, but I believe it is just a clever applyication the basic shuffle product (etc...) formulas for iterated integrals. 2) More conceptually, is there a reason we expect such a relation to hold (i.e. without having to explicitly calculate it)? For example, suppose $M$  has a $2\times 2$ period matrix $A$; as far as I understand this matrix provides the coefficients for an isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology and singular cohomology of $M$. Why should its determinant relate to the iterated integral over the commutator of the two generators of $H_1(M)$ given by the images of $\alpha, \beta$ in the abelianistion map $\pi_1 (M,x)\to H_1 (M)$? 3) When the period matrix is larger, are there further relations between its determinant and more complicated iterated integrals involving elements of $\pi_1 (M,x)$ and the basis elements for $H^1_{ dR} (M)$?","['algebraic-topology', 'manifolds', 'iterated-integrals', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Clearly LU factorization has some value, I would like to know what that it.

2010067,What is an intuitive way to understand the dot product in the context of matrix multiplication?,"I was trying to understand where it came from that each row in a matrix multiplication is a dot product, as in: $$
Ax = \left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1}^T \\
\vdots \\
a_m^T  \end{array} 
\right)x = \left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1}^Tx \\
\vdots \\
a_m^T x  \end{array} 
\right)
$$ what is an intuitive explanation or interpretation that each row is a dot product of the vector x? What I do understand is that $Ax$ encodes a linear transformation $T$. Consider a super simple example in 2 dimensions to explain what I do understand. I understand that $Ax = A [x_1 x_2] = T(v) = T(x_1 \hat i + x_2 \hat j) = x_1 T(\hat i) + x_2 T( \hat j)$. This makes me interpret intuitively that a multiplication by a matrix gives me a new vector that is composed of the same linear combination of the transformed basis vectors (or whatever vectors v is composed of) [source] . Furthermore one can easily see from this view where the multiplication of a matrix comes from: $$Ax = \left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} \\  
\end{array} 
\right] 
x = \left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc}
T(\hat i)_1 & T(\hat j)_1\\
T(\hat i)_2 & T(\hat j)_2\\
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\

x_2
\left[

\left[

T(\hat i)_1 x_1 + T(\hat j)_1 x_2\\
T(\hat i)_2x_2 + T(\hat j)_2 x_2\\
\end{array}
\right]
$$ where now its obvious why matrix multiplication is defined the way it is (because of linear transformations). Notice that the nice thing about this view is that one can interpret that each column of the matrix tells us how each basis vector changes . i.e. each column specifies how $\hat i$, $\hat j$ are transformed. Furthermore, the amount it used to be in the old vector is retained but now its in the new direction $T(\hat i)$ for the first coordinate. This for me is really intuitive and explains a lot of where matrix multiplication comes from. However, if you notice this view reveals that each row $(Ax)_i = a_1^T x$ is a dot product of the initial array representation of the vector. This seems to me to not be a coincidence and that something deeper has to be going on. Usually dot products are related with projections so I was trying to understand if each coordinate of $(Ax)_i$ might actually be encoding how much the original $x$ is being projected into each row vector of $A$ (or possible something to do with the row space of $A$ i.e. $C(A^T)$ ). In an attempt to understand this I considered what each row means: $$ \left[ a_{i,1} \dots a_{i,m} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
x_1\\
\vdots\\
x_n \\
\end{array} \right] = \sum^n_{j=1} a_{ij} x_j$$ in the old interpretation I had of what a column of a matrix is (this time the matrix is 1 by m), it seems that the columns $a_{i,j}$ specifies how much some basis vector $e_i$ is transformed. However, I've had difficulties understanding beyond that what the significance of the dot product of $x$ with the rows of $A$ means. Does someone know how to interpret this or how to understand it at a conceptual level, similar to the way the interpretation I gave of what the columns of a matrix mean? Are we doing some transformation to the row space of $A$ or something like that?","['intuition', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations']"

2010361,Estimating and checking the maximum of sin(t)+cos(t),"This is a problem from Calculus by Gilbert Strang. But please note that at this point, the author has not yet introduced the formal definition of a derivative nor the concept of limits. Draw a graph of $f(t) = sin(t) + cos(t)$. Estimate its greatest height
  (maximum $f$) and the time it reaches that height. By computing $f^2$ check
  your estimate. Since $sin(0) = 0$, $cos(0) = 1$ and $sin(\frac \pi 2) = 1$ and $cos(\frac \pi 2) = 0$, the maximum of $f$ should be in the middle. Based on that assumption, our estimate is $sin(\frac \pi 4) + cos(\frac \pi 4) = \sqrt 2$ at $t = \frac \pi 4$. Now, $f^2(t) = (sin(t) + cos(t))^2 = 1 + 2sin(t)cos(t)$ so $f^2(\frac \pi 4) = 1 + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt 2}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt 2}2 = 2 = (\sqrt 2)^2$. I do not think I have really checked my estimate.

2010394,Proving the existence and uniqueness of an operator over a Hilbert space,"Let $H$ be a Hilbert space and let $f \colon H \times H \to \mathbb C$ be a
  sesquilinear map such that
  $$    M = \sup \{ |f(x, y)| \mid x, y \in H, \|x\| = \|y\| = 1 \} < \infty$$ Prove that there exists a unique operator $S \in B(H)$, such that
  $$    f(x, y) = \langle Sx, y \rangle,\qquad\forall x, y \in H.$$
  Finally, prove that $\|S\| = M$. My incomplete attempt Fix $x \in H$ and consider the functional
\begin{align*}
    \Phi_x \colon H &\to \mathbb C\\
                  y &\mapsto \overline{f(x, y)}
\end{align*} $\Phi_x \in H^\star$ is well-defined by construction, since by
hypothesis $f(x, y) \in \mathbb C$. $\Phi_x$ is linear.
Let $y, z \in H$ and $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb C$. Then
$$\Phi_x(\alpha y + \beta z) = \overline{f(x, \alpha y + \beta z)} =
    \alpha \overline{f(x, y)} + \beta \overline{f(x, z)} = \alpha
    \Phi_x(y) + \beta \Phi_x(z).$$ $\Phi_x$ is bounded. Let $y \in H$. We have to prove that there
exists a constant $c \in \mathbb R$ such that $|\Phi_x(y)| \leq
c\|y\|$. If $y = 0$, the inequality is trivially true. Therefore,
suppose $y \neq 0$. Using the bilinearity of $f$ we have that
$$|\Phi_x(y)| = |\overline{f(x, y)}| = |f(x, y)| =
    \|x\|\cdot\|y\|\left|f\left(\frac{x}{\|x\|},
    \frac{y}{\|y\|}\right)\right| \leq M\|x\| \cdot \|y\|$$
Therefore we can take $c = M\|x\| \in \mathbb R$, since $x$ is fixed.
We also observe that $\|\Phi_x\| \leq M\|x\|$. By Riesz's representation theorem, there exists a unique element in $H$, which we call $Sx \in H$, such that $\Phi_x(y) = \overline{f(x, y)} = \langle y, Sx \rangle$. We will now prove that $S \in B(H)$. $S$ is linear. Let $x, z \in H$ and $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb C$.
For all $y \in H$, we have that
$$\langle y, S(\alpha x + \beta z) \rangle = \overline{f(\alpha x +
    \beta z, y)} = \overline{\alpha f(x, y) + \beta f(z, y)} =
    \bar\alpha \langle y, Sx \rangle + \bar\beta \langle y, Sz \rangle
    = \langle y, \alpha Sx + \beta Sz \rangle$$
From the arbitrariness of $y$, it follows that $S(\alpha x + \beta z) =
\alpha Sx + \beta Sz$. $S$ is bounded. From Riesz's theorem, we have that $\|Sx\| =
\|\Phi_x\|$, and at point $3.$ above we proved that $\|\Phi_x\| \leq
M\|x\|$. So $\|S\| \leq M \in \mathbb R$ and $S$ is bounded. Finally, we use the definition of operator's norm:
$$\|S\| = \sup \{ \|Sx\| \mid x \in H, \|x\| = 1 \} = {\large\textbf{?}}$$ Questions 1. Is the proof correct up to the last point? I'm particularly interested in the second part, where I applied Riesz's theorem. 2. How should I conclude it? I know it must be related to the definition of $M$, probably I'm just missing something simple.","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory', 'proof-verification']"
2010406,Peter Walker's $C^{\infty}$ conjectured nowhere analytic slog,"Consider the function $h(x)$ which is conjectured to be $c^\infty$ nowhere analytic, and can be used to generate what we call the base change slog, which is the inverse of the basechange sexp.  This is Peter Walker's helper function from his 1991 paper.  In http://eretrandre.org/rb/files/Walker1991_111.pdf Peter Walker proves $h(x)$ is $C^{\infty}\;$ infinitely differentiable.  How can we prove that $h(x)$ nowhere analytic?  $h(x)$ has a surprisingly simple definition, and converges nicely at the real axis. $$l(x) = \ln(x+1)$$
$$h_n (x) =  l^{[n]}\exp^{[n]}(x) $$
$$h(x) = \lim_{n\to \infty} h_n (x) $$ There is an analytic Abel function $\alpha(z)$ for iterating $f(z)=\exp(z)-1,\;\;\alpha(f(z))=\alpha(z)+1$, which has an aymptotic series studied by Ecalle; see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/45608/does-the-formal-power-series-solution-to-ffx-sin-x-converge .
Then Peter Walker's slog function, which has also been referred to the basechange slog, is: 
$$\text{slog}(x) = \alpha(h(x))\;\;\;\text{slog}(\exp(x))=\text{slog}(x)+1 $$ Peter Walker was aware of the difficulties of defining $h(z)$ in the complex plane, and wrote, ""...we cannot identify our function ... with Kneser's function defined by conformal mappings, without an extension of the domain of the function h to include nonreal values. Until both these difficulties have been overcome, the possibility remains that ... two ... distinct generalized logarithms have been constructed."" In fact, we now have more tools to generate Kneser's analytic sexp(z)/slog(z) solution, and there is a 1-cyclic mapping connecting it to Walker's solution.  For Walker's solution, the issue is that when $\exp^{[n-1]}(z)=(2m-1)\pi i\;$ then $\exp^{[n]}(z)=-1\;$ so $l(\exp^{[1]}(z))\;$ has a singularity in the definition of $h_n(z)$ and these singularities get arbitrarily close to the real axis as n increases. So even though the iteration of $h_n(x)$ converges superbly at the real axis, it fails to converge in any radius in the complex plane, no matter who small that radius is.  As far as I know, it has yet to be proven that Walker's solution doesn't converge to its Taylor series anywhere, so that Walker's solution is nowhere analytic. Here are some steps I took to understand the $h(x)$ function by understanding the $h_n(x)$ sequence. I continue to use the shorthand $l(x)=\ln(x+1)\;$ along with $l^{[n]}(x)$ for the iterated $l(x)$.  I also make use of the shorthand $\chi(x)=\exp(x)\;\;\;\chi^{[n]}(x)=\exp^{[n]}(x);$ and the shorthand $\Delta_n(x)=h_n(x)-h_{n-1}(x)$. $$ h_0(x)=x;\;\;\; h_1(x) = h_0(x) + l\left(\frac{1}{\exp(x)}\right) $$ $$ \Delta_1(x) = l \left(\frac{1}{ \chi^{[1]}(x) }\right)$$ $$ \Delta_2(x) = l \left( l \left(\frac{1}{ \chi^{[2]}(x) }\right)\frac{1}{ (\chi^{[1]}(x))+1 } \right)$$ $$ \Delta_3(x) = l \left(l \left(l \left(\frac{1}{\chi^{[3]}(x)}\right)\frac{1}{ \chi^{[2]}(x)+1 } \right)\frac{1}{ l^{[1]}(\chi^{[2]}(x))+1 }\right)$$ $$ \Delta_4(x) = l \left(l \left(l \left(l \left(\frac{1}{\chi^{[4]}(x)}\right)\frac{1}{ \chi^{[3]}(x)+1 } \right)\frac{1}{ l^{[1]}(\chi^{[3]}(x))+1 }\right)\frac{1}{ l^{[2]}(\chi^{[3]}(x))+1 }\right)$$
$$ \Delta_4(x) \approx \frac{1}{\chi^{[4]}(x)}\cdot\frac{1}{ \chi^{[3]}(x)+1 } \cdot \frac{1}{ l^{[1]}(\chi^{[3]}(x))+1 }\cdot\frac{1}{ l^{[2]}(\chi^{[3]}(x))+1 }\cdot\left(1-\frac{O}{2\chi^{[4]}(x)}\right)$$ The above equation can be extended arbitrarily.  One can also expland these equations using the Tayor series $l(x)=x+\frac{-x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{-x^4}{4}+...$, which is what I think the next step is which leads to an expansion whose first term is the approximation above.  But then ultimately, we need to show that sum of these $\Delta_n(x)$ is nowhere analytic by studying the Taylor series expansion of $\Delta_n(x)$.  Then one hopes to show that as n increases, for low enough terms, the Taylor series for $\Delta_n(x)$ is very small compared with $\Delta_{n-1}(x)$ but for large enough terms, the Taylor terms grow faster than any $r^n$, so that the series radius of convergence gets arbitrarily small.","['real-analysis', 'complex-analysis', 'analyticity', 'tetration', 'power-towers']"

The AM is the number corresponding to the fulcrum's position when the plank with the stones on it is completely still and parallel to the ground. The Weighted AM is the same situation with some of the stones having the weight distinct from 1 pound.
