First i would like some advice on the question itself, How does it sound, is it possible to make it better? 
Otherwise what are some theorems you can recommend me? What other research should i approach?
What does 21st century geometry look like? How is it used in the real world?

2102736,Order of sublattice.,"I am reading serre's book A Course in Arithmetic"""",
and want to understand the Hecke operator.
Let $\omega_1,\omega_2\in \mathbb{C},$
and $\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_1}\in \mathbb{H},$
where $\mathbb{H}$ stands for upper half plane,
we define a lattice in $\mathbb{C}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
\Gamma:=\mathbb{Z}\omega_1\oplus\mathbb{Z}\omega_2.
\end{align*} 
It is obviously a additive subgroup of $\mathbb{C}$.
Let $\mathcal{R}$ be the set of lattices of $\mathbb{C}$,
and $X_\mathcal{R}$ be the free abelian group generated by $\mathcal{R}$. Suppose that $T(n):X_\mathcal{R}\longrightarrow X_\mathcal{R}$ is a group homomorphism defined as follow:
\begin{align*}
T(n)\Gamma=\sum_{(\Gamma,\Gamma')=n}\Gamma'.
\end{align*}
In other words, $T(n)$ transforms a lattice to the sum of its sub-lattices of index $n$. With the notations above,
he said: My qusetion: why the lattice $\Gamma'$ must contains $n\Gamma$? why the number of $\Gamma'$ is equal to the number of subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^2$ of order $n$? how can we count the number of projective lines over finite fields? Some of ny ideas: I sence that it may need ""Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms"". I have known a obvious isomorphism $\mathbb{Z}\omega_1\oplus\mathbb{Z}\omega_2\cong\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}.$
Thus we can just consider the subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$. Any help is greatly appreciated!","['reference-request', 'number-theory', 'modular-forms', 'hecke-algebras', 'modular-arithmetic']"

2102804,"If $q^k n^2$ is an odd perfect number with Euler prime $q$, does $I(n^2) \geq 5/3$ imply $k=1$?","Let $\sigma(x)$ denote the sum of the divisors of $x \in \mathbb{N}$.  Denote the abundancy index of $y \in \mathbb{N}$ by $I(y)=\sigma(y)/y$. If $\sigma(N)=2N$, then $N$ is said to be perfect . Euler proved that every odd perfect number has the form $q^k n^2$ where $q$ is prime (called the Euler prime ) with $q \equiv k \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $\gcd(q,n)=1$. If $k=1$, then since $q \geq 5$, then we have
$$I(q)I(n^2)=2 \Longleftrightarrow I(n^2)=\dfrac{2q}{q+1} \geq \dfrac{5}{3}.$$ If $k>1$, then we can use the bound
$$I(q^k) < \dfrac{q}{q-1} \leq \dfrac{5}{4}$$
so that
$$I(n^2)=\dfrac{2}{I(q^k)} > \dfrac{2(q-1)}{q} \geq \dfrac{8}{5}.$$ Here is my question: If $q^k n^2$ is an odd perfect number with Euler prime $q$, does $I(n^2) \geq 5/3$ imply $k=1$?","['number-theory', 'perfect-numbers', 'conjectures', 'elementary-number-theory']"

2102925,Equivalence of the Box and product topologies on a finite product,"This is a very basic question but am having trouble showing it so will really appreciate any help with this, thanks in advance. Let $(X_i,\mathscr{T}_i)$, $i=1,...,n$ for some $n\in\{2,3...\}$ and $X=\prod\limits_{i=1}^nX_i$.  Then the box topology $\mathscr{T}^*$ on $X$ is generated by the basis $\mathscr{B}^*:=\{\prod\limits_{i=1}^n U_i|U_i\in\mathscr{T}_i\}$ and the product topology $\mathscr{T}'$ is generated by the subbasis $\mathscr{S}':=\{\pi^{-1}_i(U_i)|U_i\in\mathscr{T}_i\}$. Now let $\mathscr{B}'$ be the basis of $\mathscr{T}'$, so the set of of finite intersections of $\mathscr{S}'$. So it seems to me that $\mathscr{B}^*\subset\mathscr{B}'$, (as $V_i\times ...\times V_n=\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n\pi_i^{-1}(V_i)$) so $\mathscr{T}^*\subset\mathscr{T}'$ but I cannot see why the reverse inclusion is true.

  $$
\vert \lambda - A_{ii}\vert \leq \sum_{j\neq i}\vert A_{i,j}\vert , i\in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}
$$ And the proof offered: If Theorem 2.1 is not satisfied, then $\lambda I-A$ is strictly diagonally dominant (SDD). $\Rightarrow$ $\lambda I - A$ is non-singular $\Rightarrow$ $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$ My problem lies with Theorem not satisfied $\Rightarrow$ $\lambda I - A$ is SDD part. I mean, the author also states that the matrix $\lambda I - A$ is SDD if $\vert \lambda - A_{ii}\vert > \sum_{j\neq i}\vert A_{i,j}\vert$ for every i But the way I see it, the theorem is already not satisfied if
$$\vert \lambda - A_{ii}\vert > \sum_{j\neq i}\vert A_{i,j}\vert$$
were to hold for some $i$ while $$\vert \lambda - A_{kk}\vert \leq \sum_{j\neq k}\vert A_{k,j}\vert$$ for some $k\neq i$, in which case $\lambda I - A$ would not be SDD. What am I missing?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'linear-algebra', 'proof-explanation']"

And, my question is about a basic fundamental definition as the following: If two smooth complex curve $z(t):[a,b]\to C$ and $z_1(s):[c,d]\to C$ have the same image, then does there exists real function $f:[a,b]\to[c,d]$ such that $z(t)=z_1(f(t))$ for all $t$ on $[a,b]$, and $f$ is a continuously differentiable functoin on $[a,b]$, and $f'(x)>0$? The way of the author use is that if there exist a continuouly differentiable real function $f:[a,b]\to[c,d]$, $f'(x)>0$, and $z(t)=z_1(f(t))=z_1(s)$, then we call the two curve $z(t)$ and $z_1(s)$ are equivalent, but I want to try to claim that it only needs that if two curve have the same image, i.e., $z(t)=z_1(f(t))=z_1(s)$ , and then we can imply the other two requirement to be equivalent.

Next, I guess that we can write $z_1^{-1}$ since $z_1$ is a one to one map, but I don't know how to say that $z_1^{-1}$ is differentiable, if $z_1^{-1}$ is continuously differentiable, then $z_1^{-1}(z_1(f(t)))=f(t)$ is continuously differentiable.

Specifically we can use $(2)$ to show that $$\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin nx} {\sin x} =n\tag{3}$$ for all rational $n$. My contention is that the above limit can not be established for irrational values of $n$ just by using $(2)$ and it necessarily requires the use of $(1)$.

2103237,Functions vs. Operators,"Let $\mathsf{I}$ be an operator that takes as input $x$ and returns $x$. Then $\mathsf{I}$ is not a function . 1 Why is this not a function? According to Lambda Calculus and Combinators , $\mathsf{I}$ is not a function in the set theoretic sense (that is, $\mathsf{I}$ cannot be represented as a set of ordered pairs): In ZF, each set $S$ has an identity function $\mathsf{I}_S$ with domain $S$, but there is no 'universal' identity which can be applied to everything. Question 1: Is this because if $\mathsf{I}$ were a function, then its domain would be some universal class $U$ that contained everything (and hence would run into Russell's paradox, implying $U$ cannot be a set)? 2 Why can't set-theoretic functions be applied to themselves? Consider that $\mathsf{I}x = x$ implies that $\mathsf{I} \mathsf{I} = \mathsf{I}$. This seems to make sense. But this implies that $\mathsf{I}$ is in its own ""domain"", which can evidently never happen in ZFC: [T]he axiom of foundation ... prevents functions from being applied to themselves. Now the axiom of foundation , according to Wikipedia, states in English that [E]very non-empty set $A$ contains an element that is disjoint from $A$. But it hardly seems evident from this why this means a function cannot be applied to itself. Question 2: Why can a set theoretic function $f$ not be in its own domain? 3 Modeling operators in ZFC The operator concept can be modelled in standard ZF set theory if, roughly speaking, we interpret operators as infinite sequences of functions (satisfying certain conditions), instead of as single functions. The author does not explain how this works. Question 3: How do we model operators like $\mathsf{I}$ in ZFC?","['set-theory', 'functions']"

Prove that  $\displaystyle \prod_{i<j} (p_i^{p_j}-p_j^{p_i})$ is divisible by $5777$. Note that $5777 = 53 \cdot 109$. We first consider $p_i^{p_j}-p_j^{p_i}$ modulo $53$. We are to prove that \begin{align*}p_i^{p_j} \equiv p_j^{p_i} \pmod{53} \quad \tag{1}\end{align*} for some primes $p_i,p_j$.There exist primes in the list such that $p_i = 53k_1+d,p_j = 53k_2+d$, where $0 \leq d \leq 52$ and $k_1,k_2 > 0$. Then $(1)$ is equivalent to $$d^{53k_1} \equiv d^{53k_2} \pmod{53} \iff d^{53(k_1-k_2)} \equiv 1 \pmod{53}.$$ Now since $53$ is odd, $k_1,k_2$ must be only odd or only even. Then note there are at least $2017-15 = 2002$ such primes $p_i,p_j$ because there are $28$ primes between $0$ and $53$. Therefore, since $\left\lceil\dfrac{2002}{53}\right\rceil = 39$, there exist $p_i,p_j$ such that $k_1 \equiv k_2 \pmod{26}$ and $k_1$ and $k_2$ have the same parity quotient upon division by $26$ and $k_1 > k_2$. Therefore, $$52 \mid 53(k_1-k_2)$$ and so we have found primes $p_i,p_j$ that satisfy $(1)$. I tried proving divisibility by $109$ using the same argument, but it didn't work: Now we consider modulo $109$. We are to prove that \begin{align*}p_i^{p_j} \equiv p_j^{p_i} \pmod{109} \quad \tag{2}\end{align*} for some primes $p_i,p_j$. primes in the list such that $p_i = 109m_1+d_1,p_j = 109m_2+d_1$, where $0 \leq d_1 \leq 108$ and $m_1,m_2 > 0$. Then $(2)$ is equivalent to $$d_1^{109m_1} \equiv d_1^{109m_2} \pmod{109} \iff d_1^{109(m_1-m_2)} \equiv 1 \pmod{109}.$$ Now since $109$ is odd, $m_1,m_2$ must be only odd or only even. Then note there are at least $2017-28 = 1989$ such primes $p_i,p_j$ because there are $28$ primes between $0$ and $109$. Therefore, $\left\lceil\dfrac{1989}{109}\right\rceil = 19$.

Thanks in advance guys! Enjoy :) EDIT AFTER SOLUTION:
Basically thanks to Doug M and the other members, I understood that I had done a STUPID mistake in the limit and so : 
$$\lim_{x\to +\infty} (17\ln|x| -3\ln|x-2| - 7\ln(2x^2 +9)  = $$
$$\lim_{x\to +\infty} ln|\frac{x^{17}}{(x-2)^3(2x^2 +9)^7}|\simeq ln|\frac{x^{17}}{(2)^7(x)^{17} + O(x^{17})}|\simeq ln|\frac1{(2)^7}|\simeq -7ln(2)$$ So the correct whole limit is:
$$\lim_{x\to +\infty} \frac 1{51}(17\ln|x| -3\ln|x-2| - 7\ln(2x^2 +9) +2 \sqrt 2 \arctan(\frac{\sqrt 2}3x) = \frac1{51}(\sqrt 2\pi - 7ln(2)) $$
In order to continue this triggering integral (because if you start something in math, you have to see it through), I need to evaluate the expression at x = 3 and I get:
$$ \frac 1{51}(-4\ln(3) +2 \sqrt 2 \arctan(\sqrt 2))$$
And so FINALLY the integral becomes:
$$ I =\frac1{51}(\sqrt 2\pi - 7ln(2)) - [\frac 1{51}(-4\ln(3) +2 \sqrt 2 \arctan(\sqrt 2))] $$
And I got the solution :)

Let $I$ be the set $\{1,2\}$, then consider the sets $\{1\}$, $\{2\}$. For objects in the slice category, take functions $i,j$ which will be the embeddings $\{1\}\rightarrow \{1,2\}$ and $\{2\}\rightarrow \{1,2\}$ respectively. Suppose there is a product $i\times j$ which has as its domain the set $\{(1,2)\}$. Let $\bar 1,\bar 2:\{(1,2)\}\rightarrow \{1,2\}$ denote the constant functions which map to 1 and 2 respectively. Then, $i\circ \bar 1:\{(1,2)\}\rightarrow \{1,2\}$ is the constant function which maps to 1, and $i\circ\bar 2$ is the constant function which maps to 2. There's no single choice for $i\times j$ which makes it an actual candidate to be a product. (I also don't think disjoint union works, it doesn't satisfy the UMP I don't think.)

My question is: why is it legal to use $\frac{dy}{dx}$ when $y$ is often not a function of $x$? For example, the curve described by the parametric equations $x=6sin(t)$ and $y=t^2+t$ ( image here ) is clearly not a function of $x$, since it fails the vertical line test infinitely many times, and yet $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2t+1}{6cos(t)}$. What is the intuition behind $\frac{dy}{dx}$ in this case? I usually think of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as the (unique) slope induced from a small change in $x$, but that doesn't make sense here, since a small change in $x$ corresponds to infinitely many changes in $y$.","['derivatives', 'calculus']"

$$Y(s)=G(s)H(s), \quad G(s)=\frac{1}{\chi}=\frac{1}{s+a}=\mathscr{L}[e^{-ax}](s)$$

$$ Now we look at the set $M=\{ \omega \in \Omega : g(\omega)=0 \}$ where $g$ vanishes. Question : Does $M$ always have $\mu$-measure zero? Partial Answer : Suppose that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite and suppose that $M$ does not have measure zero. Then we can find a subset $M_0$ of $M$ which has positive but finite measure, i.e. the characteristic function $\chi_{M_0}$ is in $L^2(\mu)$. But we have $M_g \chi_{M_0} = 0$, so by the assumption $\chi_{M_0}$ is the zero function. This is a contradiction. The problem with this is that in general we do not have $\sigma$-finiteness of $\mu$. So this argument won't work. Maybe some context: This statement is needed in a proof of the spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators on a (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space. The function $g$ is given by the spectral theorem for bounded, normal operators, i.e. we are given a non-trivial Hilbert space $H$ and a normal operator $A$ on it which then is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by $g$ on $L^2(\mu)$.

Could you help us with this simpler sample set of only 3 balls, one of each color?  Note, we have agreed that we can assume that the first ball was replaced since there is no zero% probability in the available answers. We think that the first pick would 1/3 for any color and the second pick (with the ball replaced in the set) would be 1/3 again.  1/3 x 1/3 = 1/9 He says that the first pick would be a 3/3 (100%) chance of picking any color since the color is not specified, second pick 1/3 so 1/1 x 1/3 = 1/3 I'd really appreciate your help.

I don't know the relevant tags for this question, so feel free to edit","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'operator-theory', 'geometry', 'category-theory']"
2104874,Definition of a distribution and integral manifolds,"We are currently talking about the various forms of the Frobenius theorem in my differential geometry class in order to build up integrability. For one of the versions, we use distributions, and I'd like to get a few things straight. Given a manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, I have that a distribution , $\mathcal{D}$, is a sub-bundle (subspace) of the tangent space $TM$ such that $\mathcal{D}\subset TM$ and $\mathcal{D}_p\subset T_pM$ for all $p\in M$. I was also told to think of the distribution as $\mathcal{D}=\text{span}\{X_1,\cdots,X_r\}$ where $X_1,\cdots,X_r$ are linearly independent vector fields in the tangent space of $M$. We also distinguished a distribution from a smooth distribution by adding the requirement that vectors must vary smoothly from point to point. Given two vector fields $X,Y \in \mathcal{D}$ with $X_p,Y_p\in \mathcal{D}_p$ if $[X,Y]\in \mathcal{D}$ then there exists an integral manifold which is a sub-manifold of the distribution; that is $\mathcal{D}$ is integrable . We also say that the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is involutive . Do you see any errors here? I'm fairly new to the material so any additional comments would be appreciated as well. Thanks.",['differential-geometry']
