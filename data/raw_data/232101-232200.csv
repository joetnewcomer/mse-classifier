Moreover, by considering the monomorphism $A/\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak p)\longrightarrow k[t]/\mathfrak p$ (where $\mathfrak p$ is an ideal), we too get that $f$ is a closed map. It remains to show that $f$ is injective (since closed, continuous bijections are homeomorphisms), but I can't seem to figure out why this is the case.

4831888,"A more straightforward proof of ""Urysohn's Lemma"" (Theorem 2.12) as it is presented in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis.","Rudin states Urysohn's Lemma as follows: $\textbf{Theorem Statement}$ Suppose $X$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space, $V$ is open in $X$ , $K\subset V$ , and $K$ is compact. Then there exists an $f\in C_c(X)$ such that $$
K\prec f\prec V.
$$ Here, $K\prec f$ means $K$ is a compact subset of $X$ , that $f\in C_c(X)$ , that $0\leq f(x)\leq 1$ for all $x\in X$ , and that $f(x)=1$ for all $x\in K$ . Similarly, $f\prec V$ means $V$ is open, $f\in C_c(X)$ , $0\leq f\leq1$ , and that the support of $f$ lies in $V$ . $\textbf{Rudin's Proof}$ Rudin constructs an open set $V_r$ with compact closure for each $r\in\mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ , such that $K\subset V_1,\ \overline{V_0}\subset V$ , each $\overline{V_r}$ is compact, and such that $$
s>r\enspace\textrm{implies}\enspace\overline{V_s}\subset V_r.
$$ He then defines $$
f_r(x)=
\begin{cases}
r&\textrm{if}\enspace x\in V_r, \\
0&\textrm{otherwise},
\end{cases}
\qquad g_s(x)=
\begin{cases}
1&\textrm{if}\enspace x\in\overline{V_s}, \\
s&\textrm{otherwise},

$$ as well as $$
f=\sup\limits_r f_r,\qquad g=\inf\limits_s g_s.
$$ He notes lower semicontinuity of $f$ and upper semicontinuity of $g$ and then proves that $f=g$ to show $f$ is continuous. $\textbf{My Question(s)}$ Why does Rudin choose his method of proof? My proof below is just as well suited to introduce the concept of semicontinuity as Rudin's proof; isn't it much more straightforward to define $$
f_r(x)=
\begin{cases}
r&\textrm{if}\enspace x\in\overline{V_r}, \\
0&\textrm{otherwise},
\end{cases}
$$ and to set $f=\sup\limits_r f_r$ ? We may directly prove $f$ is continuous as follows: $\textbf{My Proof}$ Define $f,f_r$ as they are defined in section immediately above (My Question(s)). First, note that for any $q\in[0,1)$ we have $$
f^{-1}(q,\infty)=\bigcup_{r>q}\overline{V_r}=\bigcup_{r>q}V_r.
$$ On the other hand, $f^{-1}(1,\infty)=\varnothing$ . Second, observe that any rational $r\in(0,1]$ satisfies $$
f^{-1}(-\infty,r)=(\overline{V_r})^c.
$$ On the other hand, $f^{-1}(-\infty,0)=\varnothing$ . Hence any open interval of the form $(q,r)$ where $q,r\in[0,1]$ , $q<r$ , and $r$ is rational satisfies the condition that $f^{-1}((q,r))$ is open. It follows from this and the above comments that $f^{-1}(W)$ is open for any open $W\subset\mathbb{R}$ , i.e., that $f$ is continuous, since any open interval $(a,b)\subset[0,1]$ may be written as a union of intervals of the form $(q,r)$ , where $r$ is rational, and $a\leq q<r\leq b$ . It is easy to see that my $f$ satisfies the conditions that $0\leq f\leq1$ , that $f(x)=1$ if $x\in K$ , and that $f$ has support in $\overline{V_0}$ , just as Rudin's $f$ does.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
4831907,"Nonisomorphic groups with the same character tables, including power maps","It is known that two finite groups with the same complex character table are not necessarily isomorphic. The examples of smallest order are the quaternion group and the dihedral group of order $8$ . We can extend the character table by specifying the power maps . Given an element $x\in G$ , we can calculate any $x^n$ up to conjugacy by following an element through its power maps one prime factor at a time. We can define this because two conjugate elements raised to the same power will still be conjugate: $$\begin{align}x^n &= h^{-1}(g^{-1}xg)^nh\\ &= h^{-1}g^{-1}(x(gg^{-1}))^{n-1}xgh^{-1}\\&= h^{-1}g^{-1}x^{n}gh\end{align}$$ $$, \forall n\in\mathbb{N}, \forall x,g \in G,\exists h\in G $$ .

If so, how to prove it ? If not, what assumptions would be sufficient to ensure its finiteness ? (Bonus : can it be upper bounded by a non-random quantity ?) My idea was to proceed by contradiction : if we assume that $B=\infty$ then we can construct (passing to a subsequence if necessary) a sequence $\hat\theta_1,\hat\theta_2,\ldots $ of minimizers of respectively $\hat R_1,\hat R_2,\ldots $ with norm going to $\infty$ . However, if we assume that the Rademacher complexity of $\mathcal F$ vanishes as $n\to\infty$ , we get by the uniform law of large numbers that $(\hat R_n)$ (as a sequence of real-valued functions defined on $\mathbb R^p$ ) converges uniformly to $R:\theta\mapsto \mathbb E_{(x,y)\sim\rho}\left[f_\theta(x)-y)^2\right]$ . I'm not sure of how to go on from here. I thought I could adapt the argument given here , to find a sequence of minimizers of $\hat R_n$ which converges to a minimizer of $R$ , but it doesn't seem to work ( $\mathbb R^p$ is not compact)...

4832193,Quotient by sheaf of ideals associated to effective divisor,"Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, and $D$ a divisor (we define a divisor to be a map $D:X \to \mathbb Z$ with closed and discrete support). Define the sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$ -modules $\mathcal O_X(D)$ with sections $$\mathcal O_X(D)(U)=\lbrace f:U\to\mathbb S : \forall x\in U,v_x(f)\geq -D(x)\rbrace.$$ If $D\geq 0$ , then $\mathcal O_X(-D)$ is a sheaf of ideals of $\mathcal O_X$ . We denote $\mathcal O_{D,x}$ the quotient sheaf. I am interested in the stalks of this sheaf. I have proved that if $D(x)=0$ , then $\mathcal O_X(-D)_x=\mathcal O_{X,x}$ , so in this case, $\mathcal O_{D,x}=0$ . If $D(x)\neq 0$ , then $\mathcal O_X(-D)_x=\mathfrak m_{X,x}^{D(x)}$ . Now the thing I don't understand is that, in this case, $\mathcal O_{D,x}$ is a $\mathbb C$ -vector space of dimension $D(x)$ , with $1,z,\dots,z^{D(x)-1}$ as a basis. Why is that? My first and obvious try is to study the quotient itself. Using the exact sequence $$0\to\mathcal O_X(-D)\to\mathcal O_X\to\mathcal O_D\to 0$$ I have shown that $\left(\mathcal O_X\big/\mathcal O_X(-D)\right)_x$ is isomorphic to the quotient of the stalks, so now I can study the quotient $\mathcal O_{X,x}\big/\mathfrak m_{X,x}^{D(x)}$ . And now I am lost. I've tried the brute force proof taking a linear combination etcetera and using a uniformizer at $x$ to maybe show that set is linearly independent but... I cannot proceed. Edit: I am adding my try on showing that directly: First, every element $f\in\mathcal O_{X,x}$ can be written like $f=uz^n$ with $z$ a uniformiser at $x$ and $u$ a unit. In the quotient, $n\leq D(x)-1$ , and that is nice but, since I am trying to prove that the quotient is a vector space over $\mathbb C$ , an element should be of the form $\sum \lambda_i z^i$ with $\lambda_i\in\mathbb C$ . What do I do with the unit? This is my first problem. In order to show that $1,z,\dots,z^{D(x)-1}$ is linearly independent, let us consider the following linear combination: $$\lambda_0+\lambda_1z+\dots+\lambda_{D-1}z^{D(x)-1}=0$$ And we have to show that all $\lambda_i=0$ . Evaluating at $x$ we have $\lambda_0=0$ , then writing $$\lambda_1+z(\lambda_2z+\dots+\lambda_{D-1}z^{D(x)-2})=0$$ we have $\lambda_1=0$ ... doing this inductively gives us linear independence! The only thing is left is proving that the set generates.","['algebraic-curves', 'riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'sheaf-theory']"
4832197,Help proving that this metric space is not path connected,"Consider the metric space embedded in $S^1$ with the intrinsic metric(the distance between two points is the length of the shortest arc connecting them): $\hspace{3cm}$ Notice there are $3$ 'gaps' in the circumference of the circle.

Is the space $\mathcal{U}$ path connected? Although it seems intuitively clear that the space $\mathcal{U}$ is not path connected, how does one formally prove it? The intuitive argument is that if you want to travel from $0$ to $1$ , you need to initially stick to the left-segment, then when you get to the end of this left segment, and the start of the next circle, again to traverse this circle, you would need to stick to the left segment, and so you're forced to take the left-most segment each time, but the ""path"" that originates if you try to do this has a single point missing precisely in the middle, and so there is no path.","['connectedness', 'path-connected', 'metric-spaces', 'examples-counterexamples', 'general-topology']"

drop off $n$ passengers in a single tour, while each passenger has an
individual pickup and dropoff location. Combinatorically, this seems to relate to both A000680 and A080934 . A000680 has the very simple and quite intutive formula $\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n}}$ . This would be the number of valid entrance and exit sequences in a vehicle with unlimited capacity  (ruling out all exit before entrance combinations). Alternatively, it could be modeled as the number of lattice walks in an n-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb{Z_{2}})^n$ . A080934 on the other hand limits the height of a dyck path. Also, for sequences of balanced parenthesss, this would mean the number of parentheses sequences of maximum depth $k$ . For instance, (()()()) has depth 2, while (((()))) has depth 4. So, in the lattice example, it would be the number of subdiagonal walks in a two-dimensional lattice with distance from root location bounded by $k$ . A recursive definition of this is explained in detail here . It is not completely congruent to my problem, since the bracket pairs are not distinguishable here. Combining these together while staying in the lattice context, my formula should also be a calculation rule for the number of possible walks in $(\mathbb{Z_{2}})^n$ where the manhattan/hamming distance from the root location is bounded by $K$ .

4832545,Finding the limit of an integral using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem,"I found the following problem while preparing for some math olympiad in my country. Let $c\in (1, +\infty)$ and $f \colon [0, c] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous and monotonically increasing function with $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$ . Calculate the following limit $$\lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{1}{t}\int_0^1 f(x)(f(x+t)-f(x))dx$$ (the integral is assumed to be a Riemann integral, it is supposed to be solved without Lebesgue integrals) My approach to solving the problem: The problem is trivial if we assume that $f$ is differentiable. If we do, then by the mean value theorem, there exists, for each $x \in [0, 1]$ a $c_t \in [x, x+t]$ , such that $f(x+t)-f(x)=f'(c_t)*t$ . Since $f$ is continuous and $f'$ is bounded, so is $f(x)*f'(c_t)$ , for all $t$ near $0$ . So our limit becomes $\lim_{t \to 0^+} \int_0^1 f(x)*f(c_t)dx$ . By Arzela's theorem for uniformly bounded integrals, we can interchange the limit and the integral and we get $\int_0^1 f(x)*f'(x)dx=0.5*(f(1)^2-f(0)^2)$ . Since every continuous function can be uniformly approximated by polynomials(Stone-Weierstrass theorem), then the set of differentiable functions with bounded derivative are dense in the set of continuous functions with the $||\cdot||_{\infty}$ norm, so for any continuous function $f_0$ , we can find differentiable functions arbitrarily ""close"" to it. These observations lead to considering the following function. Let $C$ be the Banach space of continuous functions with the $||\cdot||_{\infty}$ norm. Let $T \colon C \times (0, +\infty) \to \mathbb{R}, T(f)(t) = \frac{1}{t} \int_0^1 f(x)(f(x+t)-f(x))dx$ . Consider now, $u \in C$ and $v \in C$ fixed and $t$ an arbitrary positive real number. Then $$
|T(u)(t)-T(v)(t)| \leq \frac{1}{t} \int_0^1 | u(x)u(x+t)-u(x)v(x+t)+u(x)v(x+t)-v(x)v(x+t)+v(x)^2-u(x)^2 |dx \leq \frac{1}{t}\left(\int_0^1|u(x)||u(x+t)-v(x+t)|dx+\int_0^1|u(x)-v(x)||v(x+t)|dx + \int_0^1|u(x)-v(x)||u(x)+v(x)|dx\right) \\ \leq \frac{1}{t} \left(\|u\|_{\infty}\|u-v\|_{\infty}+\|u-v\|_{\infty}\|v\|_{\infty} + \|u-v\|_{\infty}\|u+v\|_{\infty}\right) \leq \frac{1}{t} \left( \|u-v\|_{\infty} \left( \|u\|_{\infty}+\|v\|_{\infty} + \|u+v\|_{\infty} \right) \right) \leq \frac{1}{t} \left( 2\|u-v\|_{\infty} \left( \|u-v\|_{\infty}+2\|v\|_{\infty}\right) \right)
$$ Therefore $T$ is continuous in $f$ uniformly in $t$ . Because of $T(f)(t)$ converges uniformly to some function $g(t)$ . Therefore, $$
\lim_{t \to 0} \lim_{f \to f_0} T(f)(t) =\lim_{f \to f_0} \lim_{t \to 0} T(f)(t) 
$$ To justify the interchange of limits, let's denote $g(t)\colon=\lim_{f \ to f_0} T(f)(t)$ , $h(f)= \lim_{t \to 0} T(f)(t)$ and $l=\lim_{f \to f_0} \lim_{t \to 0} T(f)(t)$ . Now let $a$ be a function such that $\|a-f_0\|<\delta$ . We can see that $$
|g(t)-l| \leq |g(t)-T(a)(t)+T(a)(t)-h(a)+h(a)-l| \leq |g(t)-T(a)(t)| + |T(a)(t)-h(a)| + |h(a)-l|
$$ And each term can be made arbitrarily small. Since the differentiable functions are dense in $C$ , we can assume WLOG that $f$ is differentiable in the limits above. The question in the problem is equivalent to $\lim_{t \to 0} \lim_{f \to f_0} T(f)(t)$ . And by interchanging limits, the result is trivial. Is my proof correct?

4832651,The alternating Abel Plana formula and Riemann $\xi\left(\frac12\right)$,"Starting from the alternating Abel Plana summation formula ( presented here ): $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^nf(n) = \frac{f(0)}{2} + i\int_0^\infty\frac{f(iy)−f(−iy)}{2\sinh(πy)} dy \tag{1}$$ and putting $f(t)=\xi\left(\frac12+it\right)$ , where $\xi(s)$ is the Riemann $\xi-$ function . Since $\xi(s) = \xi(1-s)$ the integral part reduces to zero and we obtain: $$2\,\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n\,\xi\left(\frac12+in\right) = \xi\left(\frac12\right) \tag{2}$$ Questions: Numerically this appears to work fine, but is it formally allowed in terms of the required growth conditions for the Abel Plana formula? This is rather philosophical, but the series on the LHS ""samples"" its values at the integer imaginary parts on the critical line. We know that $\xi\left(\frac12+it\right)$ oscillates around $0$ and has its sign changes at the non-trivial zeros. Given the unpredictable nature of these zeros, the signs of the integer samples are expected to fluctuate rather randomly as well. Does this imply that the complexity of the distribution of the non-trivial zeros is fully ""encoded"" in $\xi\left(\frac12\right)$ ADDED 1: Numerical evidence strongly suggests that the above could be generalised as follows: $$\xi(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\,\big(\xi\left(s+in\right)+\xi\left(1-s+in\right)\big) \qquad s \in \mathbb{C} \tag{3}$$ or after expanding to the $d$ -th derivative: $$\xi^{(d)}(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\,\big(\xi^{(d)}\left(s+in\right)+(-1)^d\,\xi^{(d)}\left(1-s+in\right)\big) \qquad s \in \mathbb{C} \tag{4}$$ ADDED 2: Numerical evidence also strongly supports the alternating series with multiplication of $\xi(s)$ : $$\frac12\,\xi(s)^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^{n+1}\,\xi\left(s+in\right)\,\xi\left(1-s+in\right) \qquad s \in \mathbb{C} \tag{5}$$","['riemann-zeta', 'number-theory', 'sequences-and-series']"

Given that we are conditioning on $E$ , our term $P(A_i|E)$ for that $i$ will simply be zero right?

4832793,κ₀ for Mercury—Formula,"I refer here to Ptolemy’s epicycle-and-deferent model of the Solar System, specifically that of Mercury (see drawing). In this model, Mercury (not shown) revolves on an epicycle of center C , which itself turns on an eccentric circle (later called “deferent”) of center D , which in turn moves on a small circle of center F . The size of this small circle is such that DF = FE = EO = 3 arbitrary units where DC = 60 of the same units. Point A is the direction of the apogee, the deferent’s point which is furthest from the Earth. Angle AFD increases uniformly and is called the mean centrum $ \bar{\kappa} $ . The true centrum , $ \kappa $ , is angle AOC —obviously, this one does not increase uniformly, and a good part of the Almagest consists of the explanation of the procedure to find it. The calculation of latitudes involves finding out distance OC for when $ \kappa = 90° $ . Its calculation is not mentioned in Ptolemy’s Almagest , but its value in the model for Mercury is specified as being about 56.7° (Ptolemy actually says it was found previously, but such is not the case). For other planets, for which the deferent is fixed and centered where point E is for Mercury, the calculation is easy: $ \displaystyle OC = \sqrt{R^2 - e^2} $ , but the calculation is made more complex in Mercury’s case, because the deferent moves, with angle AFD equal to (but in opposite direction from) angle AEC , in both cases being $ \bar{\kappa} $ . In A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy , Otto Neugebauer states that, in order to find this value, “One finds a cubic equation for the sine of the angle under which the eccentricity e = 3 is seen from C” (p. 221, n. 1).

(I got it from a Master's student report, which I am not sure if they want to share it publically) System description For a particle in an infinite square well (""particle in a box""), the solutions to the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation are known. In a box with length $a$ (for simplicity $a=1$ ), the particle has a wavefunction/eigenfunction $\psi_n$ with corresponding energy/eigenvalue $E_n$ , where $n$ refers to the state, with $n=1$ being the ground state. $$
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\right)|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle\\
\psi_n = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{a}x\right)\\
E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2}{2a}
$$ A perturbation can be made, specifically a Dirac potential in the middle of the well. This means that the energies and wavefunctions are no longer known. Perturbation theory can approximate the perturbed system using solutions of the unperturbed system. Look at Physics Exchange , which discusses the same problem. However, they did not state any closed form of the different correction terms. Perturbation theory The repulsive Dirac potential will change the Schrödinger Equation. $$
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\delta\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle.
$$ Perturbation theory , says that the Hamiltonian $\mathscr{H}$ can be split in the unperturbed Hamiltonian $\mathscr{H}_0$ and the perturbation $\mathscr{V}$ . Some shorthand notation can be set up. $$
V_{ij} = \langle i|\mathscr{V}|j\rangle = \langle i|\delta\left(x-\frac{a}{2}\right)|j\rangle = 2\sin\left(\frac{i\pi}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{j\pi}{2}\right)\\
E_i^{(0)} = E_i = \frac{i^2\pi^2}{2}.
$$ This shows that $V_{ij}=V_{ji}$ and note that $a=1$ was used. Using the unperturbed wavefunctions and energies, the ground state energy of the perturbed system ( $\mathscr{E}_1$ ) can be approximated. For the first few terms a closed form can be found, could this be extended to arbitrary order? $$\mathscr{E}_1=E^{(0)}_1 + E^{(1)}_1 + E^{(2)}_1 + E^{(3)}_1 + E^{(4)}_1 + E^{(5)}_1 + ...$$ Diagrammatic perturbation theory One way of finding the energy corrections is called diagrammatic perturbation theory . ""Modern Quantum Chemistry"" by Szabo and Ostlund has a chapter on this [1]. It comes down to the fact that diagrams can represent parts of the energy correction terms. The rules for drawing the diagrams are as follows: Draw $n$ dots vertically, in order. Connect all $n$ dots together with a continuous line, so that each dot has one line passing through it. Do this in all possible distinct ways. diagrams are equivalent if each and every dot is connected to an identical pair of dots. Then arrows can be added to the lines, lines going down are ""hole lines"" and lines going up are called ""particle lines"". The perturbation ( $\mathscr{V}$ ) is represented by the dots. The rules to translate the diagrams into expressions are as follows: Each dot contributes a factor $\langle\psi_{\text{label line in}}|\mathscr{V}|\psi_{\text{label line out}}\rangle$ , to the numerator. Each pair of adjacent dots contributes to the denominator factor $\sum E^{(0)}_{\text{hole}}-E^{(0)}_{\text{particle}}$ , this sum runs over all lines crossing a (imaginary) horizontal line separating two adjacent dots The overall sign of the expression is $(-)^{h+l}$ , $h$ is the number of hole lines and $l$ is the number of closed loops (which is 1 in this system). Below the diagrams representing the first four corrections to the energy are shown. Below that their corresponding expressions are given. \begin{align}
    E^{(1)}_1 = V_{11}&\\
    E^{(2)}_1 = \sum_{n\neq1}& \frac{V_{1n}^2}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)}\\
    E^{(3)}_1 = \sum_{nm\neq1}& \frac{V_{1n}V_{nm}V_{m1}}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)\left(E_1-E_m\right)}-V_{11}\frac{V_{1n}^2}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)^2}\\
    E^{(4)}_1 = \sum_{nmk\neq1}& \frac{V_{1n}V_{nm}V_{mk}V_{k1}}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)\left(E_1-E_m\right)\left(E_1-E_k\right)} + V_{11}^2\frac{V_{1n}^2}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)^3} \\&- V_{11}\frac{V_{1n}V_{nm}V_{m1}}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)^2\left(E_1-E_m\right)}- V_{11}\frac{V_{1n}V_{nm}V_{m1}}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)\left(E_1-E_m\right)^2} \\&- \frac{V_{1n}^2V_{1m}^2}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)\left(2E_1-E_n-E_n\right)\left(E_1-E_m\right)} - \frac{V_{1n}^2V_{1m}^2}{\left(E_1-E_n\right)^2\left(2E_1-E_n-E_n\right)}
\end{align} One can see that there would be 24 distinct diagrams for the 5th order and 120 for the 6th order. Using Mathematica the infinite sums are then evaluated, and the energies at the top of this post are found. Concluding, is there a series or an easy way to go to higher orders?

4833031,$q$-analog of Number Theory [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 5 months ago . Improve this question The main motivation behind this is to see whether the 'magic' of q-analogs can be felt in number theory. Obviously for q-analogs to be applied to number theory the parametrization in $q$ must yield a generalization in some way whilst simultaneously keeping the structure in such a way that we are still studying numbers. For example: If in some equations involving q-numbers we are manipulating expressions and suddenly we get an additional ' $q^2$ term', as so $${[n]}_q + q^2= 1+q + 2q^2 ... + q^{n-1}$$ This becomes pretty meaningless in the context of number theory. It's good to wonder whether this is possible, studying a $q$ -analog of numbers, as by constructing some q-analog without it arrising naturally we are essentially just doing number theory with some unnecessary parameters. One way I thought to do this was as follows. Let ${[n]}_q$ denote the $q$ -number such that $${[n]}_q = \frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$$ such that $\lim_{q \rightarrow 1}{[n]}_q = n$ . We have the following rule for multiplication $${[nm]}_q = {[n]}_q{[m]}_{q^n}$$ Since we can write every number as a product of some primes and their powers $n = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_i^{k_i}$ we arrive at the following $q$ -analog expression $${[n]}_q = {[p_1^{k_1}]}_q{[p_2^{k_2}]}_{q^{p_1^{k_1}}}\ldots{[p_i^{k_i}]}_{q^{p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}}} \\ = \left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_1-1}{[p_1]}_{q^{p_1^j}}\right)\left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_2-1}{[p_2]}_{q^{p_2^jp_1^{k_1}}}\right)\ldots\left(\prod_{j=0}^{k_i-1}{[p_i]}_{q^{p_i^jp_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\ldots p_{i-1}^{k_{i-1}}}}\right)$$ resulting in the fact that $${[n]}_q = \prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}{[p_i]}_{q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}}\right)$$ (Writing the $p$ -adic valuation $\nu_{p_i}(n)$ instead of $k$ ) Now we can turn to cyclotomic polynomials $$\Phi_n(x) = \prod_{\,\,\, 1 \leq k \leq n \\ \gcd(k,n) = 1} (x - e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{n}})$$ Note that since all $k \leq n$ (for some prime $n$ ) is coprime to $n$ if $n$ is prime we get $$\Phi_n(q) = {[n]}_q$$ (when $n$ is prime) Because of this we can write any $q$ -number as a product of cyclotomic polynomials. For example the obvious $${[n]}_q = \prod_{d \mid n}\frac{\Phi_d(q)}{\Phi_1(q)}$$ Perhaps more interestingly, using the formula we derived above we can see that $${[n]}_q = \prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}\Phi_{p_i}\left(q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}\right)\right)$$ Note that $$n = \lim_{q \rightarrow 1}\prod_i\left(\prod_{j=0}^{\nu_{p_i}(n)-1}\Phi_{p_i}\left(q^{p_i^j\prod_{r \leq i}p_r^{k_r}}\right)\right)$$ This form of product of cyclotomic polynomials has been studied by Borwein and Choi , who in their paper state that Any polynomial $P(x)$ with even degree $N-1$ and coefficients $\pm$ 1 is cyclotomic iff $$P(x) = \pm \Phi_{p_1}(\pm x)\Phi_{p_2}(\pm x^{p_1})...\Phi_{p_r}(\pm x^{p_1p_2...p_{r-1}})$$ Borwein and Choi's conjecture of the odd degree case is immediately obvious for all $\quad {[2k+1]}_q \quad \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ by the connection presented above At first glance this seems to offer insight into number-theoretic statements through the roots of these equations, and hence Galois theory The twin-prime conjecture can be re-stated as asking whether there are infinitely many cases where $$1+q+q^2\Phi_p(q) = 0$$ for $q \in \{x: \Phi_{p+2}(x) = 0\}$ . This could allow for a different angle to approach the conjecture, from the perspective of varieties in algebric geometry. One could derive such a polynomial in $q$ for primes with any size gap. Although I'm not sure if this would lead to any progress toward the conjecture, I do think it could reveal some interesting structures. For simple number sums like $$\sum_{n=0}^{m}a_n$$ where $a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ we have the following analog $$\sum_{n=0}^{m}{[a_n]}_qq^{\sum_{k < n}a_k}$$ This can also be considered in the case where $a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$ . Either way we are left with a sum with 'Fibonacci'-like properties $$a_0+a_1q^{a_0}+a_2q^{a_0+a_1}+a_3q^{a_0+a_1+a_2}...$$ This can be studied from the perspective of Lucas sequences If we consider the analog to a sum over the divisors of $n$ in terms of the ' $q$ -divisors' of $n$ (i.e the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{d \mid n}(q)$ ) we get $$\left[n\sum_{d\mid n}\frac{f(d)}{d}\right]_q \rightarrow \left(\prod_{d\mid n}\frac{\Phi_d(q)}{\Phi_1(q)}\right) \sum_{d\mid n}\frac{f_q(d)}{\Phi_d(q)}$$ for example: $f\rightarrow (1-q)$ $$ = \Phi_{d_1}(q)\Phi_{d_2}(q)...\Phi_{d_{i-1}}(q)+...+\Phi_{d_2}(q)\Phi_{d_3}(q)...\Phi_{d_i}(q)$$ Another potentially interesting application is the study of $q$ -congruences on $q$ -numbers. One could look at some $${[n]}_q \equiv f(q) \quad \text{mod} \,\,\, \Phi_m(q)$$ $${[n]}_{q^k} \equiv \quad ... \quad \text{mod} \,\,\, {[m]}_q$$ This seems to already exist though. Here ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) are some papers that go over it. Although the concept seems to be studied with regards to hypergeometric series, instead of numbers, so this could also be very interesting These are the basic ideas. I would like to know if this parametrization and subsequent generalization of numbers in terms of cyclotomic polynomials is a viable analog to number-theory, or if there is another better analog. Relevant formulas, ideas, related papers, etc. are also appreciated. $q$ -analogs aren't widely used in (elementary) number theory, so this post (depending on the viability of 'number-theortic $q$ -analogs') can serve as a starting point.","['number-theory', 'big-list', 'soft-question', 'q-analogs']"

Which one is bigger 2^3 or 3^2. Of course 3^2 beacause it's 9 and the other one is 8. What about 2^4 and 4^2? They're equal.
Basically this was my idea: How many times is x^y different or equal to y^x , when x and y ranges from 1 to n (x and y are natural numbers). I wrote a code to it and for the first 60 there was nothing unusual. Then I was only interested in ratios ((times x^y = y^x) / (n^2 (all combinations))). I ran the code for bigger numbers and plotted it. I found a weird curve. For the first 60 numbers the ""diff ratio"" was increasing, then it started to decrease with a ""pattern"" (I couldn't figure out what could it be exactly). I also noticed that the ratios not just decreasing and increasing, they are converging, and not to 0.5-0.5, but 0.75 and 0.25. I can't figure out why does this happen, I tried to run the code with bigger numbers, but even after n=35000 it still hasn't crossed the previously mentioned limit. (I'm guessing it has something to do with the powers of 2) What do you think, did I make a mistake somewhere in my code or I just didn't noticed a pattern?

Linear Algebra Done Right, 4th edition, by Sheldon Axler. Chapter 3, section 3B, exercise 32. Notation used. $\mathcal{L}(V)$ is the set of all linear transformations from a vector space $V$ to $V$ . $\mathbb{F}$ represents either the set of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$ , or the set of complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$ . What I've tried. Axler suggests to use the definition of a two-sided ideal which goes as follows: A subspace $\mathcal{E}$ of $\mathcal{L}(V)$ is called a two-sided ideal of $\mathcal{L}(V)$ if $TE \in \mathcal{E}$ and $ET \in
\mathcal{E}$ for all $E \in \mathcal{E}$ and all $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ . I have shown before that $\mathcal{L}(V)$ is a two-sided ideal of $\mathcal{L}(V)$ . This implies that for any $S,T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ , we have $ST \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $TS \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ . This implies that $\varphi(TS)$ is well-defined. Since $\varphi(ST) = \varphi(S)\varphi(T)$ , we must have then $\varphi(TS) = \varphi(T)\varphi(S)$ . It is easy to show that $$\varphi(S)\varphi(T) = \varphi(T)\varphi(S)$$ This implies that $\varphi(S)\varphi(T) - \varphi(T)\varphi(S) = 0$ which, by the distributive property of linear maps, grants us $$\varphi(S)[\varphi(T) - \varphi(T)] = 0$$ Question. Obviously, this will not lead me to the conclusion $\varphi = 0$ . Is this the direction I am meant to go in? Could someone give me a hint? The only place where I have used the fact that $V$ is finite-dimensional is when showing $\varphi(S)\varphi(T) = \varphi(T)\varphi(S)$ (I omitted this here, but have shown it on paper). Am I supposed to use it elsewhere to help me?","['linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces', 'linear-transformations']"

I have tried it and I think I reached a successful answer, however, I would like that my answer was confirmed. Here is my approach: To begin with, if I fix an element of $C$ , for the set $B$ , I use inclusion-exclusion principle: the cardinal of the set of subsets of $A$ with non-empty intersection with $B$ is obtained by fixing one of $3$ elements in $B$ and obtaining another $2^{28} - 1$ subsets (without counting the empty set). However, if I decide to choose two elements fixed, there are $3$ options to do that, and another possible $2^{27} - 1$ subsets. For fixing all elements in $B$ , there are $2^{26} - 1$ subsets remaining. Therefore, using inclusion exclusing I have $3\cdot 2^{28} - 3\cdot 2^{27} + 2^{26} - 1$ possible sets taking into account the intersection between a subset and $B$ . I can fix two elements of $C$ , so for the moment it would be $2 \cdot that \ quantity$ . Now, if there are the two elements of $C$ fixed in the intersection, then using the same reasoning would be $3 \cdot 2^{27} - 3 \cdot 2^{26} + 2^{25} - 1$ Using again inclusion-exclusion, the final answer would be the first final term minus the second final term since I have counted twice all the cases in which both $29,30$ appear. Is this correct? By the way, if I just wanted to know the intersection of subsets and $B$ , is my reasoning right?","['combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

If my system has a non-zero solution for $x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}$ is there an equivalent statement that the determinant of the coefficient matrix must vanish? Based on some experiments, it seems to be that if I define $A_1 = (a_{ij})_{i,j=1}^{n-1}$ and $A_2 = (a_{ij})_{i,j=2}^{n}$ then the existence of a non-trivial solution requires both $A_1$ and $A_2$ to have a non-vanishing determinant .

However, I am not interested in non-vanishing determinants. I would like to know is there anything which must vanish .","['nonlinear-system', 'linear-algebra']"
4833441,How to interpret what a set is to see how it could be infinite?,"Currently, 'infinite set' sounds oxymoronic to me, so my question is how to interpret what a set is such that it is consonant with it being infinite. I understand that we take it as axiomatic that infinite sets exist, but I'm wondering how to interpret what a set is on a high-level way to allow for the possibility of it being infinite. A set has been taught to me to be 'a collection of objects'; and when considering the set of all $x$ , the capacity to collect all types/instatiations of $x$ implies to me that the set of all $x$ is finite- in real life, if I imagine these things as discrete objects, and collecting in a box of some size, I can only fit a finite amount into this box. I do potentially see that we could 'fit' an infinite amount of reals in a finite space of length 1, in some sense; however, the act of collecting them cannot be performed in a real world time, and this doesn't work to explain the set of all real numbers, or the set of all natural numbers- I fail to see how it is possible to collect them. So I am wondering how to interpret a 'collection of objects', or 'set', here, in an abstract way which allows for it being infinite.","['elementary-set-theory', 'philosophy', 'infinity', 'discrete-mathematics']"

  x = \frac{u-v}{\sqrt{2}}

The problem involved an integrand containing $xy$ , which is transformed to $1/2(u^2-v^2)$ . Now, out of curiosity, are there other transformations in higher dimensions sending $x_1x_2 \cdots x_n$ to $a\cdot(u_1^2 \pm u_2^2 \pm \ldots \pm u_n^2)$ for some constant $a$ ? What is the Jacobian, if such transformations exist? Do these transformations involve complex coefficients, and what are the transformations with real coefficients?

Consider the set $$N_T := \bigcap \{\overline{T(V)} : V \text{ is a neighborhood of } 0\},$$ where $\overline{A}$ denotes the closure of a subset $A \subset Y$ . Notice $N_T$ is a closed linear subspace of $Y$ . First I'd like to point out that this set seems to remind me of the kernel of a linear operator, but clearly this isn't the case, since $N_T\subset Y$ . I'd like to show that $T$ is continuous if and only if $N_T = \{ 0 \}$ . First we can see that $0\in N_T$ , since for every neighbourhood V of 0, we have that $T(0)\in\overline{T(V)}$ , and by linearity we have that $T(0)=0$ , thus, $0\in N_T$ .
I also tried using the fact that $T$ is continuous iff $T$ is continuous at 0, but that didn't take me very far either.

I'm curious under what circumstances we can represent one of these lattices as the lattice of closed sets on a topological space $(X, \tau)$ . I've tried a lot of things to try to build myself a point-set representation of an arbitrary (distributive) lattice (with a global maximum and minimum). Intuitively, filters and especially ultrafilters act a lot like element-elements in a family of sets. So, I tried making my point set $X$ the ultrafilters in $\Lambda$ (and declare the representation of a lattice element $a$ to be the set of ultrafilters containing it), since that respects $\land$ and $\lor$ but I immediately ran into problems. If we take the lattice of closed sets of the Sierpiński space , $\{ \{a, b\}, \{b\}, \varnothing \}$ , there's only one ultrafilter, so it collapses down to the two-element Boolean algebra. I also tried taking my lattice $\Lambda$ and adding a new formal operation the formal relative complement , $a \setminus b$ , to try to build myself a larger Boolean lattice for $\Lambda$ to embed into, and then take ultrafilters there. My intuition is breaking down though and I remember from looking at Boolean algebras previously that they can have few or no atoms or otherwise be really badly behaved. So, at this point, I'm taking a step and wondering which lattices can be represented as the lattices of closed sets in topological spaces in the first place.","['general-topology', 'abstract-algebra']"
4833605,Alternative proof that ring of functions does not contain any nontrivial multiple of the exponential function,"Let $R$ be the ring generated by $\{\sin, \cos, \sec\}$ , closed under scalar multiplication by $\mathbb{R}$ , and accompanied by a derivative operator $D$ . The following hold: $D(\sin) = \cos$ $D(\cos) = -\sin$ $D(\sec) = \sin \sec^2$ $\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1$ $\cos \sec = 1$ Consider the equation $Dx = x$ ; it's a differential equation. Let $S$ be the ring consisting of analytic real functions defined almost everywhere. I add in the defined almost everywhere constraint to cover the fact that $\sec$ is technically not a total function of the reals. Within $S$ , the solution to $Dx=x$ is $\{ r\exp : r \in \mathbb{R} \}$ . $0$ is in $R$ and is a solution to $Dx=x$ . I claim that it is the only solution in $R$ . We can prove this by noting that any unbounded function in $R$ approaches positive or negative infinity as its argument approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$ . Whenever $r \neq 0$ , $r \exp$ is unbounded. However, it doesn't approach positive or negative infinity as its argument approaches $\frac{\pi}{2}$ , therefore it is outside of $R$ . Alternatively, we could prove this by noting that every function in $R$ is periodic, and the only periodic multiple of $\exp$ is $0$ , since $\exp$ is not periodic as a real function. However, solving this problem in this way required pulling in a lot of information about how real functions behave, rather than treating the functions abstractly. Is there a way to prove this algebraically, by appealing to the ring structure of $R$ , the linearity of $D$ , and the facts that we know about $D$ ?","['alternative-proof', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

4833720,Can such a pair of functions exist?,"Let $p\colon \mathbb{Z}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ and $q\colon \mathbb{Z}^n\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ , such that: $\forall x,y,z\in \mathbb{Z^n}\colon q(x, p(y)) \leq q(x, p(z)) \iff d(x,y) \leq d(x,z)$ $\forall x\in \mathbb{Z^n}\colon q(x,\cdot)$ is monotone, where $d$ denotes the Euclidean distance. Can such $p$ and $q$ exist? It's clear that $p$ cannot be something as simple as $\|x\|_2$ , since for example in case of $n=2$ both $\|(1,0)\|_2 = \|(-1, 0)\| = 1$ , but if $x = (2,0)$ then $(-1,0)$ is twice as far from it as $(1,0)$ . This makes me think, that $p$ somehow must encode the position in an invertible way. An idea I had is that for a fixed $x\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ we could define $p$ using the following: Since all the points are grid points, we could cover them with a countable number of circles (spheres). The sequence of radii is the square root of the integers that are expressable as the sum of $n$ squares. For $n\geq 4$ , all the natural numbers form the sequence of radii, due to Lagrange's four-square theorem. The complicated part is the number of lattice points on these spheres, this is related to the sum of squares function . But it's easy to see, that from the perspective of an $x\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ if we order the points first by the index of the sphere and then by the index on the sphere (which for $n>2$ can be also tricky) then the $$C_{1,1}, C_{1,2}, C_{1,3}, C_{1,4}, C_{2,1}, C_{2,2}, C_{2,3}, C_{2,4}, C_{3,1}, C_{3,2} \dots$$ sequence can define $p(y)$ as we need. For every point $y$ assign its index in this ""C-sequence"" as $p(y)$ . So for example $p(C_{1,1}) = p((0,1)) = 1$ , $p(C_{2,2}) = p((-1,-1)) = 6$ , etc. The problem is that this whole construct is for a fixed $x$ as we use it as the center of the spheres. Let for $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}^n: c_x(y)$ denote the index of $y$ in this ""C-sequence"" if the center is $x$ (instead of $\underline{0}$ as in the example). It's easy to see that these $c_x$ functions are invertible. Let's define $p$ as $p(x) = c_{\underline{0}}(x)$ . Since they are invertible, we can define $q$ as a function that transforms the ""C-sequence"" from the perspective of $\underline{0}$ to the perspective of $x$ : $$q(x, p_y) = c_x(c_{\underline{0}}^{-1}(p_y))$$ Due to this strongly hacky definition it's true that if $p_y = p(y)$ , $p_z = p(z)$ and $q(x,p_y) \leq q(x,p_z)$ then $d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)$ since $q(x,p_y) = c_x(c_{\underline{0}}^{-1}(p_y)) = c_x(y)$ is the order of $y$ in the ""C-sequence"" from the perspective of $x$ , which is equivalent to the distance of $y$ from $x$ . So this satisfies my first condition. There is only one problem left, $q(x,\cdot)$ is clearly not monotone. It's easy to craft a counter-example for $n=2$ . Since $q(x,\cdot)$ is essentially the transformation taking $c_0$ into $c_x$ , it's enough the find points $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $c_{\underline{0}}(a)\leq c_{\underline{0}}(b)\leq c_{\underline{0}}(c)$ but neither $c_x(a) \leq c_x(b) \leq c_x(c)$ nor $c_x(a) \geq c_x(b) \geq c_x(c)$ holds. The following is a counter-example: $$c_{(0,0)}((0,1)) = 1 \leq c_{(0,0)}((1,0)) = 2 \leq c_{(0,0)}((1,2)) = 13$$ but $$c_{(2,1)}((0,1)) = 12 \geq c_{(2,1)}((1,0)) = 3 \leq c_{(2,1)}((1,2)) = 8$$ This was a kind of ""intuitive"" way of defining $p$ and $q$ but it didn't work out, so I'm wondering if it's really possible. It actually feels a little unnatural to have such functions, so maybe I should focus on proving their non-existence.","['functions', 'geometry', 'real-analysis']"

Now, let's define the derivative of $\delta(x)$ as \begin{equation*}
\dot{\delta}(x)\triangleq \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\delta(x+\tau)-\delta(x)}{\tau}

&= \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{1}{\tau}\left[f(0-\tau) - f(0)\right]=-\dot{f}(0)\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*} provided that we can push the limit sign outside the integral (if I'm not wrong, here Lebesgue help us to see when this can be done); the difference between the two integrals is not in the form $\pm \infty \mp\infty$ ; the derivative of $f(x)$ exists in $x=0$ .

4833783,Integration by parts for distributions (generalized function),"The following question comes from a research paper. I have simplified some statements and backgrounds.

$$ Now I am stating some properties we have already deduced. If $u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2), Lu \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ ( $Lu$ is understood as a distribution), then for any $t_0 \in \mathbb{R},$ we have $u|_{t=t_0} \in H^{-1/2}(\mathbb{R})$ and the following estimate holds $$
\| u|_{t=t_0}\|_{H^{-1/2}(\mathbb{R})} \leq C(\| u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}+\| Lu \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}).
$$ Moreover, $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ (compactly supported functions) are dense in $\{(u,Lu): u \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2),Lu \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2) \}$ with respect to the graph norm $\| u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}+\| Lu\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)}.$ Hence, for $u,Lu \in L^2$ , we know that there is a sequence of functions $u_n \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ so that $u_n,L u_n$ converge to $u,Lu$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2),$ and $u_n|_{t=t_0}$ converges to $u|_{t=t_0}$ in $H^{-1/2}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $t_0 \in \mathbb{R}.$ Clearly, for any compactly supported function $v$ and $u_n,$ the classical integration by parts formula holds: \begin{equation}

I believe that there is a more elegant/algebraic approach to this problem because of the following observations I made: $A^{-1}=(A^T)^2\implies \det A= 1$ so there can be at most $\dfrac{(3^3-1)(3^3-3)(3^3-3^2)}{3-1}=5616\tag*{}$ such matrices.

For each permutation $\sigma$ of $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , there are four matrices such that $\text{diag}(A)=\sigma$ . This accounts for the $1+4+4+3!\cdot 4=33$ such matrices. I would want to know why $(2)$ and $(4)$ are true. Here's a short summary: For a matrix $A$ over the field of three elements, it looks like: $$A^{-1}=(A^T)^2 \iff  \begin{array}\ A^T=A\\ \text{det }A=1\\  A^3=I \end{array}\implies \text{tr}(A)=0$$ However, I don't have a proof, it's just observations. Update: After a long discussion in comments, it is clear to me why $(2)$ and $(4)$ are true. Why (2) is true? You can rewrite the given condition as $A^T=(A^TA)^{-1}$ ; now take transpose on both sides to get $A=(AA^T)^{-1}$ and now, use these facts: The product of a matrix and its transpose is always symmetric. The inverse (if exists) of a symmetric matrix is symmetric. Why (4) is true? $1$ is the eigen value of $A^3$ with algebraic multiplicity of $3$ ... This means that eigenvalues of $A$ are of the form cube-root of unity. There is only one cube root of unity in this field. It is $1$ iteself. So the eigenvalues of $A$ are $1,1,1$ . Thus, $\text{tr}(A)=1+1+1=0$ . Account for 33 solutions : I think I have also got an idea for a more elegant approach which accounts for the $33$ solutions. I don't know if there is any fallacy in my logic, it is not at all rigorous :( The properties $A^3=I$ and $A^T=A$ are preserved under conjugation by a non-singular diagonal matrix in this field . What I mean is that: Let $D$ be a non-singular diagonal matrix (there are $2^3$ choices because $0$ can't be diagonal entry). If $A$ is a solution, $DAD^{-1}$ is also a solution. Reason : $\mathbb Z_3^*$ is a cyclic group of order two and the group of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_3^*\times \mathbb Z_3^*\times \mathbb Z_3^*$ which is Boolean group. Hence, $D^2=I$ . This implies that $D^{-1}=D=D^{T}$ . Thus, the conjugate $DAD^{-1}=DAD^T=(DAD^{-1})^T$ is symmetric. Also, notice that $(DAD^{-1})^3=DA^3D^{-1}=I$ . Another point to note is that Conjugation by a diagonal matrix preserves the diagonal… I mean that $\text{diag}(DAD^{-1})=\text{diag}(A)$ . Reason: When you left multiply $A$ by a diagonal matrix $D$ , each row $i$ is scaled by $D_{ii}$ . Following that right multiplication by $D^{-1}$ , scales each column $i$ by $1/D_{ii}$ . As a result, the diagonal elements remain unscaled and intact. Given a solution $A$ with $\text{diag}(A)=(1,2,0)$ , how many $D$ -conjugates of $A$ exist? $D$ and $-D$ yield the same conjugate because $DAD^{-1}=(-D)A(-D)^{-1}$ … We have $8/2=4$ unique diagonal matrices upto sign, each of which yield a unique $D$ -conjugate of $A$ . These conjugates have the same diagonal as $A$ and also satisfy our condition. Likewise, for every solution $A$ with $\text{diag}(A)=(2,2,2)$ or $(2,1,0)$ , etc. (we make sure the trace is zero), we have $4$ solutions each by conjugating $A$ with diagonal matrices. $A=I$ is an exception because $DID^{-1}=I$ so we don’t get any new solution. Leaving $(1,1,1)$ aside, there are $8$ other arrangements for the diagonal entries which make the trace zero: $(0,0,0)$ , $(2,2,2)$ or some permutation of $(1,2,0)$ . For each of these types of arrangements along the diagonal, it is observed that there is at least one solution, which can be $D$ -conjugated to generate new solutions. \begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline \text{diag}(A) & \text{No. of $D$-conjugates}\\ \hline (1,1,1)&1\\ \hline(0,0,0)&4\\ \hline (2,2,2)&4\\ \hline (1,2,0)&4\\ \hline (1,0,2)&4\\ \hline (0,1,2)&4\\ \hline (0,2,1)&4\\ \hline (2,1,0)&4\\ \hline (2,0,1)&4\\ \hline \end{array} That makes the count $8\times 4+1=33$ .","['matrices', 'finite-fields', 'linear-algebra']"

4833876,How can tempered distributions be identified with functions?,"In Stein's Harmonic Analysis: Real-Variable Methods, Orthogonality and Oscillatory Integrals , he defines tempered distribution ( $\mathscr S'$ ) as continuous linear functionals from the Schwartz class. Here, the continuity is given with respect to the family of seminorms \begin{equation*}\|\Phi\|_{\alpha,\beta}=\sup_{x\in\mathbb R^N}|x^\alpha\partial^\beta_x\Phi(x)|.\end{equation*} Then, without any further clarification, he proceeds to discuss convolutions between a tempered distribution and functions in the Schwartz family. This is where I get puzzled. If the tempered distributions are functionals, what is this convolution supposed to mean? It seems as if he (and every other source, for that matter) was assuming these functionals can be clearly identified with some functions. My question is: how do you make this identification? I was thinking, as Schwartz functions are in $L^2$ , maybe the identification is the one given by Riesz representation theorem. However, I think this is not possible as the topology we are considering in the Schwartz class is different from that of $L^2$ . Moreover, while discussing $H^p$ spaces, he claims that, for $p>1$ , $L^p$ is the same as $H^p$ . Here, he is using again this identification that I don't quite get and, if my hypothesis was correct that the identification is made through Riesz representation theorem, this should mean $H^2=L^2=\mathscr S'$ . This seems a bit strange to me. Another thing that's worrying me as well is the fact that he is discussing, without a prior definition, bounded distributions. Of course, if these were elements of $L^2$ 's dual, they would be automatically bounded, so this is another hint that my original assumption about the identification is wrong. I think this is a very basic question, but I don't find any source in which this is specifically discussed and clarify. How can we talk about an object as both a tempered distribution (an element of $\mathscr S'$ ) and a function defined on $\mathbb R^N$ ?","['distribution-theory', 'real-analysis', 'functional-analysis', 'dual-spaces', 'schwartz-space']"

4833916,Prove that $f(x)$ is almost everywhere equal to a characteristic function,"Suppose $f$ be a non-negative function in $L^{1}[0,1]$ . Suppose that for every integer $n=1,2,3..$ , we have $$ \int_{[0,1]} f(x)^{n} dm= \int_{[0,1]} f(x) dm $$ Then prove that $f(x)$ must be almost everywhere equal to the characteristic function $\chi_{E}$ of a measurable set. My attempt: Since $f \in L^{1}[0,1], \int_{[0,1]} f dm < \infty$ . I am partitioning the sample space such into $$A_{1} = \{   |f| > 1 \}$$ $$A_{2} = \{   |f| = 1 \}$$ $$A_{3} = \{ 0 <  |f| < 1 \}$$ Applying Fatou's lemma to $g_{n}=f(x)^{n}$ , we get that $$\int_{[0,1]} \liminf_{n \to \infty} g_{n} \leq \liminf_{n \to \infty} \int g_n= \int_{[0,1]}f(x) dm $$ $$\int_{[0,1]} \liminf_{n \to \infty} f(x)^n \leq  \int_{[0,1]}f(x) dm $$ Now, I multiply both the sides with $\chi_{A_1}(x)$ ( it is measurable as f is measurable). $$\int_{[0,1]} \liminf_{n \to \infty} f(x)^n \chi_{A_1}(x) \leq  \int_{[0,1]}f(x) \chi_{A_1}(x) dm $$ $$\int_{[0,1] \cap A_1} \liminf_{n \to \infty} f(x)^n  \leq  \int_{[0,1]\cap A_1}f(x)  dm $$ Thus, $m(A_1)=0$ , else we get a contradiction. For $A_{3}$ , I multiply the original equation with $\chi_{A_3}$ on both the sides, $$ \int_{[0,1] \cap A_3} f(x)^{n} dm= \int_{[0,1]\cap A_3} f(x) > \int_{[0,1] \cap A_3}  dm > 0$$ But, this is true for all $n$ and as we increase $n$ to infinity, we get $0$ on the Left Hand side, hence $m(A_3)=0$ as well. For values of $x$ in $A_2$ , $f(x)^{n}=f(x)$ for all $n$ . Hence $f(x)=1$ almost everywhere.

T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v),\ \forall u,v\in\mathbb R^n\tag1
\end{align} and \begin{align}
T\big(\langle u\rangle\big)=\big<T(u) \big>,\ \forall u\in\mathbb R^n,\tag2
\end{align} this means \begin{align}
\forall u\in\mathbb R^n,\ \forall\lambda\in\mathbb R,\ \exists\,\mu=\mu(\lambda)\in\mathbb R:\ T(\lambda u)=\mu(\lambda,u)T(u),\tag3
\end{align} Moreover, we assume that \begin{align}
T(\lambda u)\,=\lambda T(u),\ \forall\lambda\in\mathbb Q. \tag4
\end{align} Then is $T$ $\mathbb R-$ linear ? My attempt : Let us define the maps as follow \begin{align}
\mathbb R\,\overset{f}{\longrightarrow}\,\langle u\rangle\,\overset{T}{\longrightarrow}\,\big< T(u)\big>\,\overset{g}{\longrightarrow}\,\mathbb R
\end{align} given by \begin{align}
\lambda\,&\longmapsto\,f(\lambda)=\lambda u
\\ \lambda u\,&\longmapsto\,T(\lambda u)=\mu T(u)
\\ \mu T(u)\,&\longmapsto\,g\big(\mu T(u)\big)=\mu.
\end{align} From the additivity of $T$ ,we can show that \begin{align}
\mu(\lambda+\varepsilon,u)&=\,\mu(\lambda,u)+\mu(\varepsilon,u)
\end{align} In other hand, we have \begin{align}
\mu(\lambda\varepsilon,u)T(u) \,=\,T(\lambda\varepsilon u)\,&=\,\mu(\lambda,\varepsilon u)T(\varepsilon u)
\\ &=\,\mu(\lambda,\varepsilon u)\mu(\varepsilon,u)T(u)
\end{align} Thus \begin{align}
\mu(\lambda\varepsilon,u)\,=\,\mu(\lambda,\varepsilon u)\mu(\varepsilon,u)
\end{align} I want to show that the function $\mu(\cdot,u)$ is multiplication preserving, and in order to get that, the first thing I think to show is \begin{align}
\mu(\lambda,\varepsilon u)\,=\,\mu(\lambda,u).\tag5
\end{align} Then, we can use this fact to show that $\mu(\epsilon^2,u)=\mu(\epsilon,u)^2$ , this will implies $\mu(\lambda,u)>0,\ \forall \lambda >0$ . Hence $$\mu(\lambda,u)-\mu(\varepsilon,u)\,=\,\mu(\lambda-\varepsilon,u)\,>\,0,\ \forall \lambda >\varepsilon. $$ Thus $\mu$ is strictly increasing. Let $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ , suppose $\lambda <\mu(\lambda,u)$ . By density of $\mathbb R$ , there exists $q\in\mathbb Q$ such that $\lambda<q<\mu(\lambda,u)$ . Since $\lambda<q$ , we have $\mu(\lambda,u)<\mu(q,u)=q$ from (4), a contradiction. By similar deduce, we claim that $\lambda=\mu(\lambda,u)$ . So all remains is to show (5), but it seems not trivial. My another try is to consider the function \begin{align}
f:\ \mathbb R&\longrightarrow\mathbb R
\\ \lambda&\longmapsto f(\lambda)=T(\lambda u)\cdot v
\end{align} for a fixed $v\in\mathbb R^n$ . From additivity of $T$ , we have $f(\lambda+\varepsilon)=f(\lambda)+f(\varepsilon),\ \forall\lambda,\varepsilon$ . Since $f(\lambda)$ is a inner product with respect to $u$ , I think we can someway show that $f(\lambda)$ is continuous, which will lead $f$ is linear. But this is not simple.
