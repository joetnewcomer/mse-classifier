2830385,Connected components of nonempty level sets form a foliation of $M$.,"Let $M,N$ smooth manifolds and $F:M \to N$ a smooth submersion. Show that the connected components of nonempty level sets form a foliation of $M$. My idea is to use the Global Fr√∂benius theorem for the distribution $D$, where $D_{p}=ker (dF)_{p}$, I proved that $D$ is involutive distribution and for each $p \in M$, $F^{-1}(F(p))$ is an integral manifold for $M$ passing by $p$. My question is: If I prove that the connected components of $F^{-1}(F(p))$ are integral manifolds for $M$, then is each one a maximal integral manifold passing by $p$ and the global Frobenius theorem assures that connected components are a foliation for $M$?","['smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'foliations']"
2830397,How to evaluate this integral using this definition?,"Let $a$ and $b$ be any two real numbers such that $a < b$, and let $f$ be the real-valued function defined on $[a, b]$ by the formula 
$$ f(x) = \mathrm{e}^x \ \mbox{ for all } \ x \in [a, b]. $$ Then how to evaluate 
$$ \int_a^b f(x) \ \mathrm{d} x, $$
using the definition of the integral given here ? My Attempt: Since $f$ is strictly increasing on $[a, b]$ [Can we show this fact using the machinery developed in the first seven chapters of Baby Rudin?], so it is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$; that is, the integral $\int_a^b f(x) \ \mathrm{d} x$ exists as a real number. Thus the upper integral $\overline{\int}_a^b f $ and the lower integral $\underline{\int}_a^b f $ are equal, where 
  $$ \overline{\int}_a^b f \colon= \inf \left\{ \ U(P, f) \ \colon P \mbox{ is a partition of the interval } [a, b] \ \right\}, $$
  and 
  $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f \colon= \sup \left\{ \ L(P, f) \ \colon P \mbox{ is a partition of the interval } [a, b] \ \right\}, $$ Thus, for every partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have 
  $$ L(P, f) \leq \int_a^b f \leq U(P, f). $$ Again as $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $[a, b]$, so, corresponding to every real number $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a partition $P_\varepsilon$ of $[a, b]$ such that 
  $$ U \left( P_\varepsilon, f \right) - L \left( P_\varepsilon, f \right) < \varepsilon. $$ Now let $P \colon= \left\{ \ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n \ \right\}$ be any partition of the interval $[a, b]$, where 
  $$ a = x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_{n-1} < x_n = b. $$
  As $f$ is a monotonically increasing function on $[a, b]$, so for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$, we see that 
  $$ m_i \colon= \inf \left\{ \ f(x) \ \colon \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i \ \right\} = f \left( x_{i-1} \right) = \mathrm{e}^{x_{i-1}}, $$
  and 
  $$ M_i \colon= \sup \left\{ \ f(x) \ \colon \ x_{i-1} \leq x \leq x_i \ \right\} = f \left( x_{i} \right) = \mathrm{e}^{x_{i}}; $$
  therefore we have 
  $$ L(P, f) \colon= \sum_{i=1}^n m_i \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{e}^{x_{i-1}} \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right), $$
  and 
  $$ U(P, f) \colon= \sum_{i=1}^n M_i \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{e}^{x_{i}} \left( x_i - x_{i-1} \right). $$ Now for each positive integer $n$, let $P_n$ be the partition of $[a, b]$ given by 
  $$ P_n \colon= \left\{ \ a, a + \frac{b-a}{n}, a +  \frac{2(b-a)}{n}, \ldots, a + \frac{ (n-1) ( b-a ) }{n}, b \ \right\}; $$
  that is, $P_n$ partitions the interval $[a, b]$ into $n$ equal subintervals. Thus 
  $$ P_n = \left\{ x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n \ \right\}, $$
  where $$ x_i \colon= a + \frac{ i(b-a)}{n} $$
  for each $i = 1, \ldots, n$. 
  Then we have 
  $$ 
\begin{align} 
 L \left( P_n, f \right) &= \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{e}^{a + \frac{ (i-1)(b-a)}{n} } \frac{b-a}{n} \\

&= \frac{ \frac{b-a}{n} }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{ b-a}{n} } - 1 } \left( \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a \right),

&= \frac{b-a}{n} \left\{ 1 + \frac{1 }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{ b-a}{n} } - 1 } \right\} \left( \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a \right) \\
&= \left\{ \frac{b-a}{n}  + \frac{ \frac{b-a}{n}  }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{ b-a}{n} } - 1 } \right\} \left( \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a \right) . 
\end{align} $$ Is what I have done so far correct? If so, then what next? How to proceed from here, preferably using only the machinery developed by Walter Rudin as far as Chapter 7 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis , third edition? P.S.: We note that, for every partition $P$ of $[a, b]$, we have 
  $$ L(P, f) \leq \underline{\int}_a^b f  \leq \overline{\int}_a^b f \leq U(P, f). \tag{A} $$ Now from (A), we can conclude that, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, by using the partitions $P_n$, we have 
  $$ L \left( P_n, f \right) \leq \underline{\int}_a^b f \leq  \overline{\int}_a^b f \leq U \left( P_n, f \right); $$
  that is, 
  $$ \frac{ \frac{b-a}{n} }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{ b-a}{n} } - 1 } \left( \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a \right) \leq \underline{\int}_a^b f \leq  \overline{\int}_a^b f \leq \left\{ \frac{b-a}{n}  + \frac{ \frac{b-a}{n}  }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{ b-a}{n} } - 1 } \right\} \left( \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a \right) \tag{B} $$
  for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now we see that 
  $$
\begin{align}
 \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{ r }{ \mathrm{e}^r - 1 } &= \lim_{r \to 0} \frac{1}{\mathrm{e}^r - 0} \qquad \mbox{ [ using the L'Hosptial's rule ] } \\ 
&= \frac{1}{1} \\
&= 1. \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$ Now as $n \to \infty$, $(b-a)/n \to 0$, and so from (1) we can conclude that 
  $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{b-a}{n} }{ \mathrm{e}^{ \frac{b-a}{n} } - 1 } = 1. \tag{2} $$ Finally letting $n \to \infty$ in (B) and using (2), we find that 
  $$ \mathrm{e}^b - \mathrm{e}^a \leq \underline{\int}_a^b f \leq  \overline{\int}_a^b f \leq \mathrm{e}^{b }  -  \mathrm{e}^a.  $$
  Therefore 
  $$ \underline{\int}_a^b f  = \mathrm{e}^b - \mathrm{e}^a = \overline{\int}_a^b f. $$
  That is, 
  $$ \int_a^b f =  \mathrm{e}^b - \mathrm{e}^a. $$ I hope I've completed the proof satisfacorily enough in the P.S., haven't I?","['real-analysis', 'riemann-integration', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'analysis']"

My thoughts and questions : $B$ is obviously  a (n - 1) $\times$ (n - 1) matrix in the field $\mathbb{K}$. For example: For n = 4 is $B$ a $\underbrace{3}_{4-1}$ $\times$ $\underbrace{3}_{4-1}$ matrix in the field $\mathbb{K}$. But generally I don't understand how $A$ $\in$ $GL_n$($K$) applies if $B$ $\in$ $GL_{n-1}($K$)$. I thought about using this lemma: Let $A$ $\in$ $K^{n,m}$ with $A$ = $
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{1} \\
A_{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}$ which means that $A_{1}$ $\in$ $K^{l,m}$, $A_{2}$ $\in$ $K^{n-l,m}$. Therefore we have that Rank(A) $\le$ Rank($A_{1}$) + Rank($A_{2}$). But it is made for  $A$ $\in$ $K^{n,m}$ and not for $A$ $\in$ $K^{n,n}$. How do I beginn this proof? and how does  $A$ $\in$ $GL_n$($K$) applies if $B$ $\in$ $GL_{n-1}($K$)$?

I can solve for a simpler case, that is when she doesn't know the number of cubes of each color.

2830445,How to recover the covariant derivative from the pull back from that on the principal bundle,"I am watching these lecture series by Fredric Schuller. Covariant derivatives - Lec 25 - Frederic Schuller @minute 01:10:11 When we arrive at the covariant derivative from the principal bundle $P$ by pulling back to the base manifold $M$ we have: $$\nabla _{T} S=dS(T)+\omega^{u, \phi} \triangleright S$$ where $S:u \to F$, $F$ any finite dimensional vector space on an open subset $u$ on $M$, $\phi: u \to P$, is the section on the principal G-bundle,  $T \in T_{x}M$, is a tangent vector at point $x$ in the base manifold $M$, and $\omega^{u, \phi}$ is the Lie algebra valued one-form on the principal bundle . Now my question is that how to recover, if possible step by step, the more familiar covariant derivative for e.g. a vector $V$ on the base manifold which is written as: $$\nabla_{\mu}V^{\nu}=\partial _{\mu}V^{\nu}+\Gamma_{\mu \lambda}^{\nu}V^{\lambda}$$ I am a bit confused when I plug a vector $V$ instead of $S$ in the general equation above and how should I put the exterior derivative of this one-form vector-valued object and operate it on another vector $T$ and also how to operate a connection one form pulled back to the base manifold on the vector $V$?","['derivatives', 'pullback', 'principal-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-algebras']"
2830450,Field having exactly two extensions of each degree,"It is well-known that a finite field has a unique extension of degree $n$, in a given algebraic closure, for every $n \geq 1$. Is there a field $F$ such that, in some given algebraic closure of $F$, there are exactly two extensions of $F$ of degree $n$, for every $n \geq 3$ (or $n$ big enough)? (Here, ""exactly two"" means that $F \subset K, L \subset \overline F$ simply satisfy $K \neq L$. In particular, I'm not identifying isomorphic fields or $F$-algebras.) A more general question would be to replace ""exactly two"" by  ""exactly $N$"" (for some fixed integer $N > 1$). Actually, the most general setting is the study of the maps $d_F$ (resp. $d_{F, \text{iso}}$, resp. $d_{F, F\text{-iso}}$) which assign, to every integer $n \geq 2$, the cardinal of the set of (resp. field isomorphism classes, resp. $F$-algebras isomorphism classes of) extensions of $F$ of degree $n$. For instance: Can $d_F$ be a constant map $n \mapsto c$ for some $1<c<\aleph_0$ ? Can $d_F$ be a bounded function (different from the constant function $1$) ? Can $d_F$ take both finite and infinite values? It can be shown that a local field of characteristic $0$ has finitely many extensions of some given degree, but the number might grow with the degree (instead of being bounded by $N$ as I want).

2830475,"An interesting proof that $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ (using only series, no trigonometry).","This question concerns an interesting proof of the fact that $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, but only using the series that defines them, not any trigonometry. So define
$$
s(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \ldots
$$
and 
$$
c(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \ldots
$$ Step 1: we prove that $s' = c$ and $c' = -s$. This can be done by differentiating the series componentwise:
$$
s'(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \ldots = c(x), 
$$
and 
$$
c'(x) = - x + \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!} + \ldots = -s(x).
$$ Step 2: we prove that $(s^2+c^2)' = 0$. Using the chain-rule on both terms and then using our result of step 1 we compute:
$$
(s^2+c^2)' = 2s \cdot s' + 2c \cdot c' = 2sc+2c(-s) = 0. 
$$ Step 3: we prove that $s^2 + c^2 = 1$. The idea here is to use step 2, to obtain something like 
$$
s^2 + c^2 = \int (s^2 + c^2)'\,dx = \int 0 \, dx = 1. 
$$
However, I cannot figure out the details of this last step. In particular, as far as I know, $\int (s^2 + c^2)'\,dx = s^2+c^2 + C$, and $\int 0\,dx = C'$. What happens with these constants?","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"

Tito Piezas III begins his answer with the quadratic Tschirnhausen transformation, $$y=x^2+mx+n$$ and by using resultants which may be calculated by WolframAlpha , one can write the result as $$y^5+c_1y^4+c_2y^3+c_3y^2+c_4y+c_5=0$$ where we proceed to make $c_1=c_2=0$. However, it is not immediately obvious to me how one performs this step, particularly the process of eliminating $x$ and replacing it with $y$.

Suppose $U$ is a connected bounded region in $\Bbb R^n$, $u\in C^2(\bar U)$ and $\Delta u\ge 0$ in $U$. Then I try to prove in the following that if $u$ isn't constant, then $\max_{\bar U}u$ is only attained on the boundary $\partial U$. Proof: for any $x\in U$ and $r>0$ such that $B_r(x)\subset U$, consider the spherical mean 
$$\phi(r):=\frac1{|\partial B_r(x)|}\int_{\partial B_r(x)} u(y)dS(y)=\frac1{|\partial B_1(0)|}\int_{\partial B_1(0)} u(x+rz)dS(z).$$
Then 
$$
\begin{align}
\phi'(r)&=\frac1{|\partial B_1(0)|}\int_{\partial B_1(0)} Du(x+rz)\cdot zdS(z)\\
&=\frac1{|\partial B_1(0)|}\int_{B_1(0)}\Delta u(x+rz)dz\ge 0
\end{align}
$$
Hence $\phi(r)$ is monotonously increasing and in particular $\ge \phi(0^+)=u(x)$ when $r>0$. Hence, if at $x\in U$ is attained the max $M$, then the above mean value inequality forces $u=M$ on a small ball centred at $x$. So $E:=\{x\in U\mid u(x)=M\}$ is open in $U$, but is also closed by continuity. So either 
$E$ is empty (max is only attained on the boundary) or $E$ is all of $U$ ($u$ is constant).","['real-analysis', 'harmonic-functions', 'partial-differential-equations', 'proof-verification', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

I am preparing for a multiple choice exam where time per question is only about $2$ minutes. Such identities are often asked in the form where LHS is given as the given and one is asked to chose the correct option for the RHS expression. It is very time consuming to actually prove the identity and then chose the correct option. Hence there is often a short cut to such problems wherein one can check all four options by substituting ratios of some common simple triangle such as the $30-60-90$ triangle. This works most of the times. However sometimes it so happens that two options seem to be correct when we check using the $30-60-90$ triangle but in reality only one answer is correct. This happens because I am using a special type of triangle (right triangle). To avoid this I am looking for a general triangle (scalene and non right angled) with simple rational sides (like $2$ or $\frac{3}{4}$) as well as angles whose trigonometric ratios are simple enough so that my method is feasible.","['contest-math', 'trigonometry', 'triangles']"

2831604,Limit of composite functions,"Let $f$ and $g$ be some functions, assuming all right conditions that allow function composition, I want to prove that $$\lim_{x \to \infty} f(g(x))=f\left(\lim_{x \to \infty}g(x)\right) $$ As long as $\lim_{x \to \infty}g(x)$ exists and it's equal to, let's say, $L$ , and $f$ is continuous at $L$ . Basically these conditions must be sufficient to guarantee that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(g(x))$ exists and it's equal to $f(L)$ . So my proof so far goes as follows: Let $\epsilon>0 $ , since $f$ is continuous at $L$ , then there exists $\delta$ such that $|f(y)-f(L)|<\epsilon$ provided that $|y-L|<\delta$ . Let $y=g(x)$ , then provided that $|g(x)-L|<\delta$ , it follows that $|f(g(x))-f(L)|<\varepsilon$ . But since $\lim_{x \to \infty}g(x)=L$ , for any $\delta>0$ there exists $N\in\Bbb{R}^+$ such that if $x>N$ then $|g(x)-L|<\delta$ . That is, for any $\epsilon>0$ , there exists $N\in\Bbb{R}^+$ such that if $x>N$ then it follows that $$|f(g(x))-f(L)|<\epsilon$$ Which proves that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(g(x))$ exists and it's equal to $f(L)$ . It's very important to me that the proof includes the existence of this limit, since it has great computational value when calculating limits that look a bit ""messy"".

2831952,Complete reducibility for the Poincar√© group,"If $(\rho,V)$ is a unitary representation of a group $G$ which is finite dimensional, then complete reducibility is kind of easy to prove. Indeed, if $V$ is not irreducible, then it has one proper invariant subspace $W$. The orthogonal complement of $W$, namely $W^\perp$ is then another proper invariant subspace so that $V$ decomposes as $$V = W\oplus W^\perp,$$ decomposing $\rho$ as $\rho|_W\oplus  \rho|_{W^{\perp}}$. Furthermore, since $V$ is finite dimensional and $W$ is a proper subspace, $\dim W,\dim W^\perp < \dim V$. We can repeat this process with $W,W^\perp$ and so on, until we get irreducible representations, and we are assured this will end because each step lowers the dimension. Now consider the Poincar√© group $\mathbb{R}^4\rtimes SL(2,\mathbb{C})$. One looks for unitary representations of this group. It is then one theorem that there are no finite dimensional unitary representations. So they are all infinite dimensional. The procedure above doesn't work. Each step won't lower the dimension. Still, physicists seem to still try to somehow get complete reducibility here. What they do, which is actually quite cryptic really is: let $(U,\mathscr{H})$ be a unitary representation in the Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$. Consider a pure translation, namely, $U(a,1)$. This is $U(a,1)=e^{-ia^\mu P_\mu}$ for hermitian operators $P_\mu$. Then they ""diagonalize"" these operators with the improper basis $\Psi_{p,\sigma}$ so that $$P_\mu \Psi_{p,\sigma}=p_\mu \Psi_{p,\sigma}.$$ Then one works on this basis, and notices that a pure $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ transformation, $U(0,\Lambda)$ acting on $\Psi_{p,\sigma}$ is such that $$P_\mu U(0,\Lambda)\Psi_{p,\sigma}=\sum_{\sigma'}C_{\sigma\sigma'}(p,\Lambda)\Psi_{\Lambda p,\sigma'}.$$ From this, Weinberg, e.g., says: In general it may be possible by using suitable linear combinations of the $\Psi_{p,\sigma}$ to choose the $\sigma$ labels in such a way that the matrix $C_{\sigma'\sigma}(\Lambda,p)$ is block-diagonal; in other words, so that the $\Psi_{p,\sigma}$ with $\sigma$ within any one block by themselves furnish a representation of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group. It is natural to identify the states of a specific particle type with the components of a representation of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group which is irreducible, in the sense that it cannot be further decomposed in this way. So it seems that all this procedure I described above is some sort of ""complete reducibility under the hood"". It seems more like ""complete reducibility parametrized by $p$"" actually. But I confess I don't get the point. Actually I've read in this blog post that the matter is actually so subtle so a ""direct integral"" decomposition would be required. So what is going on here? How is complete reducibility actually dealt with for the Poincare group? What is this ""physicists procedure"" Weinberg shows and comments all about?","['mathematical-physics', 'functional-analysis', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory', 'lie-groups']"

2831983,A Killing field on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of positive sectional curvature has a singularity,"This problem comes from do Carmo's book on page 104. I've almost got this thing worked out but am stuck at one point. The problem is long so I'll try to break it down. Assume $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold of even dimension whose sectional curvature is positive. Show that every killing field $X$ on $M$ has a singularity, i.e. a point $p$ where $X_p = 0$. We have the following maps: $A_{X}: \mathfrak{X}(M) \rightarrow \mathfrak{X}(M)$ defined by $A_{X}(Z)=\nabla_{Z}X$ $f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by  $f(q)=\| X \|_{q}^{2}=\langle X, X \rangle_{q}$. Let $p \in M$ be a critical point of $f$, i.e. where $df_{p}=0$. I proved the following lemma (exercise 2 from p. 104): Lemma: For any $Z \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$, we have at the critical point $p$ (i) $\langle A_X(Z),X \rangle_p = 0$ (ii) $ \langle A_X(Z),A_X(Z)\rangle_p = \frac{1}{2}Z_p(Z\langle X,X \rangle)+  R(X,Z,X,Z)(p)$ We will look at a point $p \in M$ where $f$ attains its minimum. Assume for contradiction that $X_p \neq 0$. The map $A_X$ defined above induces a map $A:T_pM \rightarrow T_pM$ by $A(y)=A_XY(p)=\nabla_Y X(p)$ where $Y$ is any extension of $y \in T_pM$. Let $E \subset T_pM$ be orthogonal to $X_p$. I want to show that the restriction $A: E \rightarrow E$ is an antisymmetric isomorphism. Note it follows from Lemma (i) that $A$ actually gives a map $E \rightarrow E$. I've already showed antisymmetric so I'm going to only show my work on isomorphism. It suffices to show that $A: E \rightarrow E$ is injective. If $A(y_1)=A(y_2)$ then $A(y_1-y_2)=0$, so let $Z=Y_1 -Y_2$ where $Y_1$, $Y_2$ are extensions of $y_1$ and $y_2$. Then, using Lemma (ii) we have $0=\langle(A(y_1-y_2),A(y_1-y_2) \rangle_p = \langle A_X(Z),A_X(Z) \rangle_p = \frac{1}{2}Z_p(Z\langle X,X\rangle) + R(X,Z,X,Z)(p)$ By the assumption on curvature, $R(X,Z,X,Z)(p)>0$, so if we can show $Z_p(Z\langle X, X \rangle) \geq 0$ then we will have a contradiction.

In the proof of Proposition 8.12, there is a part that I do not understand clearly. For my problem in particular, I am not sure that all the context is actually needed in order to understand what is going on. However, just to be sure, let me write down what we are doing. The statement is the following. Let $S$ be a scheme, let $E$ be a smooth curve over $S$, let $N\geq 1$ be an integer. Suppose $X$ is a closed subscheme of $E$ that is finite flat of finite presentation over $S$ of degree $N$. For sections $P_1,\ldots ,P_N:S\rightarrow X$, the following are equivalent: 1. $P_1,\ldots ,P_N$ form a full set of sections of $X$. 2. The following equality of effective Cartier divisors holds: $$X=\sum_{i=1}^N[P_i]$$ Actually, my problem lies in the easiest part of the proof, that is $2.\Rightarrow 1.$ Here is how the proof of the book goes. We may assume that $S=\operatorname{Spec}(R)$ is affine. For $i=1,\ldots ,N$, we let $\mathcal{I}_i$ be the defining sheaf of ideals of the effective Cartier divisor $[P_i]$ of $E$. By the equality of divisors $X=\sum_{i=1}^N[P_i]$, the finitely generated free $\mathcal{O}_S$-module $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a successive extension of the invertible $\mathcal{O}_S$-modules $\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\mathcal{I}_j/\prod_{j=1}^{i}\mathcal{I}_j$. For any element $f\in \Gamma (X,\mathcal{O})$, the multiplication-by-$f$ map of $\mathcal{O}_X$ induces the multiplication-by-$f(P_i)$ map of $\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\mathcal{I}_j/\prod_{j=1}^{i}\mathcal{I}_j$. Hence, we have $\operatorname{Norm}_{X/S}(f)=\prod_{i=1}^Nf(P_i)$. That is the proof. Now, the part of it that bugs me is the one I wrote in italic: what does ""a successive extension of $\mathcal{O}_S$-modules"" actually mean? I understand that $\mathcal{O}_X=\mathcal{O}_E/\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathcal{I}_j$ (or, to be more exact, this is rather $i_{\star}\mathcal{O}_X$ where $i$ denotes the closed immersion of $X$ in $E$). What does ""successive extension"" then mean? Should we exploit the algebraic fact that if $L\subset M\subset N$ are modules, then $(N/L)/(M/L)=N/M$? If so, how does this writing allows us to make sense of the following argument about the multiplication by $f$ endomorphism?

That is, there is no non-trivial reduced word on $a^{\pm 1}, b^{\pm 1}$ defining the identity. Equivalently, $a, b$ satisfy the universal property defining $F_2$. I tried attacking this the first way: suppose $u$ and $v$ are free generators, then if I take a word on $a$ and $b$ I can rewrite it in terms of $u$ and $v$. But how do I know that if I took a non-trivial reduced word on $a, b$ defining the identity, it does not become trivial after reduction with $u$ and $v$? I also tried to use the universal property. Then we get that if $a$ and $b$ are not free, $F_2$ is isomorphic to one of its propert quotients. Maybe this is not the case for $F_2$ specifically, but it may be for other groups, so no contradiction in sight once again. I know this is true because it is used in a class I am taking.

(More generally, $[0,1]$ is not homeomorphic to $[0,1]^2$.) However, is there a continuous a.e. (almost everywhere) bijective function from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]^2$? The motivation for asking this question comes from the following: 1) $([0,1],B_{[0,1]})$ is borel isomorphic to $([0,1]^2,B_{[0,1]^2})$, i.e., there exists a measurable bijective function $f$ from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]^2$, and its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also measurable. 2) By Lusin's theorem, we have that for every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a compact $E ‚äÇ [0, 1]$ such that $f$ restricted to $E$ is continuous almost everywhere and $\mu (E)>1-\varepsilon $, where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.

Just to stay concrete suppose $a_{n}=\frac{1}{n}$ then when I look at ''$\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. whenever $n \geq N$'' I get confused.

2832587,Roots of polynomial over finite field form a group,"I was playing around with some polynomials over finite fields (specifically $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ where $p$ is prime), and I was wondering if there is in general a condition for the roots of a polynomial to form a group. As an example, the polynomial that prompted the question was $x^3 - 1$. Playing around with the roots in different fields, I noticed that the set of solutions is always either $\{1\}$ or $\{1,k,k^{-1}\}$, which are obviously subgroups of the finite field we work in. It's easy to show that this is always true. Next came the generalization to polynomials of the form $x^q-1$ for any $q\in \mathbb{N}$, and it again it's fairly straightforward to show that their roots form a group. However after investigating some more, it looks like I got lucky with those polynomials, as other ones I've looked don't have that nice structure in their roots. The base condition that already limits our choice quite a bit is that $1$ must be root, but I haven't found any more restrictions.

2832699,Tate module of an elliptic curve.,"In the case of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a field $K$, I know that there is a good definition of the so-called Tate module, for every prime $p$, which is the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module $T_p(E)=\underset{\underset{n}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}E[p^n](K^s)$, where $E[p^n]$ is the subscheme of $E$ representing its $p$-torsion, and $K^s$ is the separable closure of $K$. I know that this object satisfies very good properties, e.g. it realizes a representation of the Galois Group of $K$. I also know that, under suitable hypothesis, $T_p(E)$ can be used to describe all the possible isogenies between $E$ and itself (or another elliptic curve). Now, I learned via Katz-Mazur book on Arithmetic moduli of Elliptic Curves, that it is possible to define an elliptic curve over arbitrary base rings, and even schemes. I was wondering, but I didn't find any good reference, wether or not it is possible to define a kind of global Tate module. In fact, consider $R$ a ring, and $E/R$ an elliptic curve, i.e. a proper, smooth scheme over $R$ equipped with a zero section, and whose fibers are elliptic curves in the usual sense. Then it is proved in Katz-Mazur that this object again comes equipped with a Group structure, so, is it is meaningful to consider the $p^n$-torsion for varying $n$. Is it possible to define a kind of relative version of the Tate module? My guess is to define it as a functor $T_p(E)$, which sends any $R$-algebra $A$ to $T_p(E)(A)=\underset{\underset{n}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}E[p^n](A)$. Clearly this defines a sheaf over the category of $R$-Algebras, being an inverse limit of sheaves. Is it representable? And, is there any beautiful and known result about it? For example situations under which it classifies isogenies of elliptic curves over $R$?

Is this quotient space a smooth (Riemannian, etc.) manifold? If so, does that manifold have a simpler or more standard equivalent description? What is its algebraic topology? Intuitively, it seems to me that the quotient space should be a smooth manifold, except possibly at the origin. (If we'd started off with the sphere $S^n$ instead of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, then we would of course get the real projective space smooth manifold $\mathbf{RP}^n$.) A few further thoughts: if we foliate $\mathbb{R}^n$ into concentric spheres, then we see that this topological space consists of a bunch of nested copies of $\mathbf{RP}^n$. So away from the origin it should locally look like $\mathbf{RP}^n \times \mathbb{R}$ and so should be a smooth manifold, but I'm not sure what happens at the origin. Another way to approach the problem is to distinguish one Cartesian coordinate (WLOG let it be the first one) and think of $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ as a direct sum $(x^1, \mathbf{y}) \in \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. We can then forget about the half-space $x^1 < 0$ since it's identified with the other half-space (with the appropriate inversion of the orthogonal subspace). If we denote the quotient space $\mathbb{R}^n / \mathbb{Z}_2$ by $Y_n$, then the identification reduces the boundary hyperplane $(x^1 = 0) \cong \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ to a lower-dimensional version of the same problem, so we can recursively describe $Y_n$ as an $n$-dimensional Euclidean half-space bounded by $Y_{n-1}$.

  as only one line! E.g. $f(3) = 9$ and $f(4) = 24$. Can anyone point me in the right direction with this problem? Perhaps tell me what area of mathematics or what concepts would help me solve this? If this is a trivial problem don't give the answer but tell let me know. Thanks.","['functions', 'geometry']"
