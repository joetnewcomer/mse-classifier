115226,Largest circle between $y=x^n$ and $y=\sqrt[n]{x}$,"Something I have been wondering about for a while. Let us look at the area between $x^n$ and $\sqrt[n]{x}$ when $x\in [0,1]$. Where $n$ is a positive integer. 
Below is an image. With a given n, how large of a circle can you fit between $x^n$ and $\sqrt[n]x$? I know that the circle must lie on the line y=x, but more than that I have not been able to figure out. Will update with my research and images. soon =) Cheers for all help and solutions","['optimization', 'geometry', 'functions']"

115230,Summing over General Functions of Primes and an Application to Prime $\zeta$ Function,"Along the lines of thought given here , is it in general possible to substitute a summation over a function $f$ of primes like the following:
$$
\sum_{p\le x}f(p)=\int_2^x f(t) d(\pi(t))\tag{1}
$$
and further
$$
\int_2^x f(t) d(\pi(t))=f(t)\pi(t)\biggr|_2^{x}-\int_2^{x}f'(t)\pi(t)dt\tag{2}.
$$ If it's possible only for some cases, how can one specify them? answered in the comments Let's continue from $(2)$ with an representation of the prime counting function:
$$
\pi(t) = \operatorname{R}(t^1) - \sum_{\rho}\operatorname{R}(t^{\rho}) \tag{3}
$$
with $    \operatorname{R}(u) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ \mu (n)}{n} \operatorname{li}(u^{1/n})$ (the so-called Riemann's ${\rm R}$ Function, see e.g. $(11)$ here ) and $\rho$ running over all the zeros (trivial and non-trivial) of $\zeta$ function. $\operatorname{li}(\cdot)$ is the logarithmic integral . So we have 
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
&=&f(t)\pi(t)\biggr|_2^{x}-\int_2^{x}f'(t)\pi(t)dt\\
&=&f(t)\left(\operatorname{R}(t^1) - \sum_{\rho}\operatorname{R}(t^{\rho})\right)\biggr|_2^{x}
-\int_2^{x}f'(t)\left(\operatorname{R}(t^1) - \sum_{\rho}\operatorname{R}(t^{\rho})\right)dt \phantom{somemorerspace}\\
&\phantom{AA}&\\
&=&\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ \mu (n)}{n}\Big\{\left[f(t)\left( \sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}} (-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}} \operatorname{li}(t^{z/n})\right)\right]_2^{x}\\
&&- \int_2^{x}f'(t)\left( \sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}} (-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}} \operatorname{li}(t^{z/n})\right)dt\Big\}\\
&\phantom{AA}&\\
&=&\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ \mu (n)}{n}\sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}}(-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}}\left\{\left[f(t)\left(   \operatorname{li}(t^{z/n})\right)\right]_2^{x} -
\int_2^{x}f'(t)\left(  \operatorname{li}(t^{z/n})\right)dt\right\}\hskip0.9in(4)
\end{eqnarray}
$$
where I tried to combine the sum a little without introducing to much confusion by using 
$$
(-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}}=
\cases{
+1&$ \text{if } z=1$\\
-1&$ \text{if } z=\rho$\\
}
$$ Now, what if we just take an approximation $\tilde{\pi}(t)$, where the sums over $n$ and $\rho$ are truncated. Is this approach still valid? I'm worried because $\tilde{\pi}(t)$ might not be monotone, which is a prerequisite of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integration . 
Let's work out the last integral, by parts:
We use
$$
\int_2^{x}f'(t) \operatorname{li}(t^{w})dt
=\left[ f(t)\operatorname{li}(t^{w}) \right]_2^x - \int_2^x \frac{f(t)wt^{w-1}}{\ln(t^w)}dt
\tag{5}
$$
which gives a nice result when $f(t)=t^{-s}$, see here :
$$
\int_2^{x}(-st^{-s-1}) \operatorname{li}(t^{w})dt
=\left[ t^{-s}\operatorname{li}(t^{w}) \right]_2^x - \int_2^x \frac{t^{-s}t^{w-1}}{\ln(t)}dt
=\left[ t^{-s}\operatorname{li}(t^{w}) \right]_2^x - \left[{\rm li}(t^{w-s})\right]^x_2.
$$ So overall we get
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ \mu (n)}{n}\sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}}(-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}}\left\{\left[f(t)  \operatorname{li}(t^{z/n})\right]_2^{x}-
\left[ f(t)\operatorname{li}(t^{z/n}) \right]_2^x +\int_2^x \frac{zf(t)t^{z/n-1}}{n\ln(t^{z/n})}dt \right\}\\
=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ \mu (n)}{n}\sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}}(-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}}\left\{\int_2^x \frac{f(t)t^{z/n-1}}{\ln(t)}dt \right\}\tag{6}\\
$$
and in the special case $f(t)=t^{-s}$ this simplifies to
$$
P_\color{red}x(\color{blue}s)=\sum_{p<\color{red}x} \frac{1}{p^s} =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{ \mu (n)}{n}\sum_{z\in\{1,\rho\}}(-1)^{1-\delta_{1z}}
\left[
{\rm li}(t^{\frac zn-\color{blue}s})
\right]^{\color{red}x}_2
\tag{7}

115397,Why is the group action on the vector space of polynomials naturally a left action?,"When seeking irreducible representations of a group (for example $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ or $\text{SU}(2)$), one meets the following construction. Let $V$ be the space of polynomials in two variables. Define a group action on $V$ by $g\cdot P(z) = P(zg)$ (in some texts the convention is $P(g^{-1}z)$). Here $z=(z_1 \; z_2)$ is a row vector and matrix multiplication is implied. So my question is, why is this a left action? In both conventions (multiplication on the right, multiplication on the left by inverse) it naively appears to be a right action. I check that $g_1\cdot(g_2\cdot P(z))=g_1\cdot P(zg_2)=P(zg_2g_1)=(g_2g_1)\cdot P(z)$, which certainly looks like a right action. What am I doing wrong here? And how can I understand this issue on a more fundamental level? Is there some contravariant functor lurking around which converts the action? I found this discussion by Michael Joyce, which seemed relevant. The space of (homogeneous) polynomials can actually be realized as $\operatorname{Sym}^k(V^*).$ Maybe that dual space functor explains something?","['linear-algebra', 'representation-theory', 'group-theory']"

115568,Is every invertible rational function of order 0 on a codim 1 subvariety in the local ring of the subvariety?,"I have been trying to read Fulton's Intersection Theory , and the following puzzles me. All schemes below are algebraic over some field $k$ in the sense that they come together with a morphism of finte type to $Spec k$. Let $X$ be a variety (reduced irreducible scheme), and let $Y$ be a codimension $1$ subvariety, and let $A$ be its local ring (in particular a $1$-dimensional Noetherian local domain). Let $K(X)$ be the ring of rational functions on $X$ (the local ring at the generic point of X). Let $K(X)^*$ be the abelian group (under multiplication) of units of $K(X)$, and $A^*$ -- the group of units of $A$. On the one hand, for any $r\in K(X)^*$ define the order of vanishing of $r$ at $Y$ to be $ord_Y(r)=l_A(A/(a))-l_A(A/(b))$ where $r=a/b$ for $a$ and $b$, and $l_A(M)$ is the length of an $A$-module $M$. On the other hand, it turns out that $Y$ is in the support of the principal Cartier divisor $div(r)$ if and only if $r\not\in A^*\subset K(X)^*$. It is obvious that $Y$ not in the support of $div(r)$ implies that $ord_r(Y)=0$, since the former claims that $r\in A^*$ from which it follows that $ord_Y(b)=ord_Y(rb)=ord_Y(a)$ since obviously $ord_Y(r)=0$ for any unit. The contrapositive states that $ord_r(Y)\neq0$ implies $Y$ is in the support of $div(r)$. Because the latter can be shown to be a proper closed set and thus containing finitely many codim. $1$ subvarieties, which shows that the associated Weyl divisor $[D]=\sum_Y ord_Y(r)[Y]$ is well-defined. What is not clear to me is whether or not the converse is true, i.e. whether $Y$ in the support of $div(r)$ implies that $ord_Y(r)\neq0$. I find myself doubting since if I am not mistaken, this is equivalent to the statement $l_A(A/(a))=l_A(A/(b))$ if and only if $(a)=(b)$, where $A$ is any $1$-dimensional local Noetherian domain (maybe even a $k$-algebra) which seems much too strong.

115574,Solving $n!=p^r-p$ with $p$ prime,"A while ago, I was told of this exercise in Pollack's book, "" Not always buried deep ."" I think it is exercise 3 in chapter 1, but I do not own a copy of the book, so I cannot give more precise references. I have heard from different people that the exercise is harder than intended, and the reference given in the book does not quite prove the statement. I was hoping somebody knew of a reference, or sees how to solve it. The question is to show the following. (I think this is then applied to show some estimates on the number of primes in an interval, but this is the part I am interested in.) If $n\ge 6$ and $2\le k\le n$, then $\frac{n!}k+1$ has a prime factor larger than $n$. Towards a contradiction, suppose that this is not the case. If $p$ is a prime factor of $(n!/k)+1$, then we are assuming that $p\le n$ and since $p\mid n!+k$, then $p\mid k$. In fact, $p=k$, or else $p$ appears in the factorization of $n!/k$. So we are saying that $(n!/p)+1$ is a power of $p$, and we are led to the equation $$ n! = p^r-p $$ from the title. Conversely, any solution to this equation leads to a pair $(n,k)$ contradicting the statement of the question, except for the fact that perhaps $n<6$. Now, the above is on the trivial side of things but unfortunately I do not see how to continue. (We have that $n<2p$. Perhaps Stirling can be somehow used to bound the size of $r$?) Note that $n\ge 6$ needs to be used somehow, as otherwise we have counterexamples: If $n=2$, we have $2!=2^2-2$. If $n=3$, we have $3!=2^3-2=3^2-3$. If $n=4$, we have $4!=3^3-3$.

One can say that, we can find all the permuted matrix $B$ and evaluate $\|A -\operatorname{perm}(B)\|_F^2$ and choose the best $B$ .

The proof considers this exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathcal J \rightarrow \mathcal G \rightarrow 0$, in which $\mathcal J$ is an injective sheaf containing $\mathcal F$, and $\mathcal G$ is the quotient sheaf. As $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal J$ are flasque, so is $\mathcal G$. Now since $\mathcal F$ is flasque, we have an exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \Gamma(X, \mathcal F) \rightarrow \Gamma(X, \mathcal J) \rightarrow \Gamma(X, \mathcal G) \rightarrow 0$. On the other hand, since $\mathcal J$ is injective, we have $H^i(X, \mathcal J) =0$ for $i>0$. Thus from the long exact sequence of cohomology, we get $H^1(X, \mathcal F) =0$ and $H^i(X, \mathcal F) \cong H^{i-1}(X, \mathcal G)$ for each $i \geq 2$. But $\mathcal G$ is also flasque, so by induction on $i$ we get the result. What I don't understand is why we can discuss the cohomology group of $\mathcal F$ in the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathcal J \rightarrow \mathcal G \rightarrow 0$. By definition, the cohomology functor $H^i(X,-)$ is the right derived functor of $\Gamma(X,-)$. So I think $H^i (X, \mathcal F)$ is related to the injective resolution of $\mathcal F$. But, in the above sequence,  is $\mathcal G$ injective? If it is, why? If not, why is the proof valid? Thanks to everyone.","['homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-geometry']"

115718,Ring homomorphisms which yield same endomorphisms on modules,"Let $\varphi: R \rightarrow S$ be a (unital) ring homomorphism. So every left $S$-module $M$ has also a left $R$-module structure via $\varphi$ and in general we have
$$ \text{End}_S(M) \subseteq \text{End}_R(M)$$
My question is: Is there a necessary and sufficient condition on $\varphi$ such that the above inclusion becomes an equality for every $M$? Note that $\varphi$ being surjective is sufficient but not necessary as $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ also has the desired property. This led me to believe $\varphi$ being an epimorphism in the category $\mathsf{Ring}$ is the condition I want but I couldn't show that or find a counterexample. Edit: We can generalize the situation with $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}$: If $R$ is commutative and $D$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $R$, the localization $R \rightarrow D^{-1}R$ has the desired property. Moreover ring homomorphisms with this ""equal endomorphisms"" property are closed under composition. So any composition of surjections and localizations also works. Unfortunately there are commutative ring epimorphisms which cannot be factored to surjections and localizations, as can be seen here . (Some time I will try to work out some of the examples given there to see whether they fail to equalize the endomorphisms or not) Edit: In general a necessary condition is that the centralizer of the image $\varphi(R)$ in $S$ should be equal to the center of $S$: We always have $\mathbf{Z}(S) \subseteq \mathbf{C}_{S}(\varphi (R))$. For the reverse inclusion, let $u \in \mathbf{C}_S(\varphi(R))$. Then letting M be the left regular $S$-module $_S S$, the map $\alpha: S \rightarrow S$ given by $\alpha(s) = us$ lies in $\text{End}_R(M)$. Now by assumption $\alpha$ is also an $S$-endomorphism. We know that $S$-endomorphisms of $M$ are right multiplications by elements of $S$. Say $\alpha$ is given by right multiplication by $t \in S$. Then evaluating at $1$, we get $u = t$. Thus left and right multiplications by $u$ coincide, that is $u \in \mathbf{Z}(S)$. Note that by above, when $R$ is commutative we get
$$\varphi(R) \subseteq \mathbf{C}_S(\varphi(R)) = \mathbf{Z}(S)$$
This means $S$ is an $R$-algebra via $\varphi$. So in this case the question can be rephrased as ""Let $k$ be a commutative ring and $S$ be a $k$-algebra. When can we say that $k$-linear endomorphisms of $S$-modules are always $S$-linear?"" Maybe this has an easy answer when $k$ is a field. A relevant (perhaps more natural) question to mine is when all homomorphisms are the same, not just endomorphisms. That is, can we find a (nice) condition on $\varphi$ such that for every pair of $S$-modules $M$ and $N$ the inclusion $$\text{Hom}_S(M,N) \subseteq \text{Hom}_R(M,N)$$ becomes an equality?","['modules', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

115755,Geometric interpretation of element by element division of one vector by another,"This is my first post here, and I'm not a mathematician, so please go easy on me :) In statistics there is a geometric interpretation of correlation that uses basic vector geometry. This is fairly straight forward, even for me: each of two vectors of data are transformed so that the length of each new vector is equal to the standard deviation of the elements in the original vector. The i'th element of the new vector x is then:
$x[i]=(X[i]-mean(X))/\sqrt{n-1}$ ,
where n is the number of elements in the vector and X is the original data vector. Then, the correlation between the two original vectors of data is then simply the cosine of the angle between the two transformed vectors. Neat ! Now, the really interesting (for me) thing is that if we have 3 independent vectors of data generated from the same probability distribution, let's call them X Y and Z, so the correlation between any 2 of them is close to zero, then the correlation between X/Z and Y/Z is usually close to 0.5-0.6, where X/Z is the element by element division of X by Z. I say ""usually"" because there are certain provisions, such that the data come from a probability distribution where near-zero values are impossible or highly unlikely (and some others which I won't go into here). So you are probably wondering why I am posting this here and not on stats.se. Well, that's because I'm trying to get a handle on the geometric interpretation of this, and in particular, the geometric interpretation of dividing one vector by another, element by element, and I guess this is more of a maths concept. EDIT/UPDATE:
I was informed (in the real world) that it is not correct to try to interpret this element-by-element division of one vector by another geometrically. Instead, we should first take the natural log of the original data vectors (this is justified since the data are physical measurements), transform them as above, and then interpret the vectors $\ln (x)-\ln (z)$ and $\ln (y)-\ln (z)$ geometrically. Apparently ""it follows"" that the angle between them will be $\pi /3 $ giving the required correlation of 0.5. Unfortunately it didn't ""follow"" for me ! Could anyone help explain ?

\begin{align}
& f(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) =a_0 + a_1 y \left( 1 + \frac{(1/2)x^2}{y^2} + \frac{(1/2)((1/2)-1)x^4}{2!y^4} \right. \\  \\
& \left. {} + \frac{(1/2)((1/2)-1)((1/2)-2)x^6}{3!y^6} + \cdots\right) + \frac{ a_2 (x^2+y^2)}{2!} \\  \\

& = a_0f(y)+a_1f(y)x+\frac{a_2f(y)x^2}{2!}+\frac{a_3f(y)x^3}{3!}+\cdots

115795,Euler Product of Modular L-series,"This question is probably really easy to someone that knows the theory of modular forms well, so I apologize if this is obvious. Suppose $E_1$ and $E_2$ are elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ and the Euler product expansion of the Hasse-Weil L-series of each matches at all primes of good reduction. Some references use the definition of modular to be that for all but finitely many primes, $L(E_1, s)=L(f,s)$ where $f$ is a (certain type of) modular form. Some references seem to say that modular means $L(E_1, s)=L(f, s)$ where it seems implied that all factors are the same. My first question is whether or not there is a way to see directly from modularity properties (such as there being an analytic continuation of $L(E_1, s)$ that satisfies a functional equation) that there is some unique way to fill in the rest of the Euler factors. The second related, or possibly equivalent, question is whether or not you can tell that $L(E_1, s)$ and $L(E_2, s)$ have the same factors just from knowing the factors of good reduction. Note: the motivation is from more general ""Galois representations coming from geometry"" where you don't know something nice about the relation between the varieties. For instance, if you prove this by first saying they must be isogenous it won't generalize. Note 2: the reason I find this hard is that a priori you could have bad reduction of $E_1$ and $E_2$ at exactly two primes $p_1$ and $p_2$, and somehow it just works out that the factor of $L(E_1, s)$ at $p_1$ is exactly the factor at $L(E_2, s)$ at $p_2$ and vice-versa to give exactly the same L-function, but the factors are filled in differently (this can't happen in the elliptic curve case because we know the formula explicitly, but again I'm wondering if it can be seen without knowledge of this formula). If you don't like this wording of the question using elliptic curves and then not being able to use that fact, the real question is if $X$ is a variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ and its middle $\ell$-adic cohomology is $2$-dimensional with the property that the L-series coming from the (contragredient) Galois representation matches the L-series of a normalize Hecke eigenform for all primes of good reduction of $X$ (an integral model was fixed), does this uniquely determine the other factors in the sense that if I had another modular variety of the same dimension with the same modular form attached I could conclude every factor of the L-series matches with every factor of $L(X,s)$?","['modular-forms', 'elliptic-curves', 'number-theory']"

115802,Solving SDE's on subsets of $R^n$.,"It is well-known (see for instance Oskendal's text ) that if $T>0$ and
$$b(\cdot,\cdot): [0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n~~~~~~\sigma(\cdot,\cdot):[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$
are measurable functions and for some $C>0$ we have
$$|b(t,x)|+|\sigma(t,x)| \leq C(1+|x|)~~\mbox{and}~~|b(t,x)-b(t,y)|+|\sigma(t,x)-\sigma(t,y)| \leq C|x-y|,$$
then there is a unique strong solution to the SDE
$$dX_t=b(t,X_t)dt+\sigma(t,X_t)dB_t.$$ I have seen papers/books talk about solving this SDE for $t<\tau_D$ where $\tau_D$ is the first time $X_t$ leaves an open set $D$.  In this case, we may only have $b$ and $\sigma$ defined on $[0,T] \times D$.  I am wondering what precisely is meant by this. One interpretation is to extend $b$ and $\sigma$ to functions defined on $[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^n$ by defining $b(t,x)=\sigma(t,x)=0$ for $x \notin D$, but if we do this we kill the Lipschitz property and no longer are guaranteed uniqueness (intuitively it seems like what happens outside of $D$ should not effect what happens to the process before it leaves $D$, but . . .).  Another way is to use something like Kirszbraun's Theorem to extend $b$ and $\sigma$ to Lipschitz functions functions on $[0,T] \times \mathbb{R}^n$, use the existence theorem to find a solution to the SDE and then stop the solution at $\tau_D$.  Since there might be multiple ways to extend $b$ and $\sigma$, it's not immediately clear that this solution is unique.  I think you can argue if it weren't (at least when $b$, $\sigma$ don't depend on $t$), you could piece together a solution up to time $\tau_D$ and a solution from $\tau_D$ to $T$ to contradict the uniqueness of the solution up until time $T$.  This all seems too complicated though. I am wondering what the ""right"" way of thinking about this sort of thing is (a reference to a book would be great).

115812,Combinatorics and snakes.,"I've recently watched a fun video about some snakes made up of modules and how we can think about the way they are arranged as follows. We have a ""snake"" composed of $n$ modules, including head and tail.  That is: Each joint (?) is flexible so that we can turn it either $0º$ or $90º$ degress, both right or left. For example, with a $3-\text{snake}$ we can make the following (among others): Suppose we start at the black dot and we place the snake, coding each $n$ placements in a string of letters. We first code the direction of the first module, as $N$, $E$, $W$ or $S$, and from there on, we note wether we're placing the module at $0º$ (straight), $90º$ (leftwards) or $-90º$, (rightwards). As an example, let's code the four configurations above (left to right, left to right) $$E:SS$$
$$E:RR$$
$$E:SR$$
$$E:RL$$ Suppose also, that the snake can't run into itself, that is: from $n\geq4$, we can't have a string composed of $n-1$ $R$s or $n-1$ $L$s, since that will mean our snake will run into itself. Given this rules, can we combinatorially find a way of computing the possible configurations of an $n-\text{snake}$? I guess we can just leave the orientation aside and then multiply by $4$. As an example, I leave the configurations for $n=3$ and starting $E:$, which are: This means there are a total of $4 \times 9 = 36$ configurations for $n=3$ if I'm not wrong. It seems easier to compute $\mathcal{S}(4)$ if we use the coding. This gives $$\eqalign{
  & SSS - SSR - SSL  \cr 
  & SLR - SLS - SLL  \cr 
  & SRR - SRL - SRS \cr} $$ $$\eqalign{
  & RRS - RRL - \color{red}{RRR}  \cr 
  & RSS - RSL - RSR  \cr 
  & RLR - RLS - RLL \cr} $$ $$\eqalign{
  & LLR - LLS - \color{red}{LLL}  \cr 
  & LRL - LRR - LRS  \cr 
  & LSR - LSL - LSS \cr} $$ I'll write some values, without multiplying by $4$: $$\mathcal{S}(1)=3^0=1$$
$$\mathcal{S}(2)=3^1=3$$
$$\mathcal{S}(3)=3^2=9$$
$$\mathcal{S}(4)=3^3-2=25$$
$$\mathcal{S}(5)=3^4-10=71$$ We can say that $$\mathcal{S}(n)=3^n-\mathcal{R}(n)$$ The reminder is actually the important thing here. We have that for the first 5 cases $$\mathcal{R} = 0,0,0,2,10$$ The reminder of $n=5$ is built up from the case $n=4$ since we just consider the next step. In the first one we set apart $$RRR$$ $$LLL$$ So now we consider the following ""products"": $$\{R,S,L\} \times RRR= RRRR , SRRR, LRRR$$ $$\{R,S,L\} \times LLL= RLLL , SLLL, LLLL$$ $$  LLL \times \{R,S\} = LLLR , LLLS$$ $$  RRR \times \{L,S\} =  RRRL,  RRRS$$ Thus we have that $$\mathcal{R}(4)\times 5 = \mathcal{R}(5)$$ The next remainder will be $$\mathcal{R}(6)=54$$ Why? We take $\mathcal{R}(5)$ as a base, and worry about the palindromes, which are $$L???L$$ Where we fill in with a triad. So we have $$\eqalign{
  & RRRR  \cr 
  & RRRL  \cr 
  & RRRS \cr} $$ $$\eqalign{
  & RLLL  \cr 
  & SLLL  \cr 
  & LLLL \cr} $$ $$\eqalign{
  & SRRR  \cr 
  & LRRR \cr} $$ $$\eqalign{
  & LLLR  \cr 
  & LLLS \cr} $$ We apply $\{R,L,S\}\times$ to the left side and get $30$ more cases. And for the right, we apply $\{R,L,S\}\times$ on the right to those that can't be turned into a plaindrome, to get $4$ more cases, plus $2\times$ the $6$ posible palindromes. We get a total of $$10\times 3+3 \times 4 +2\times6 = 54$$ Thus $$\mathcal{S}(6)=3^5-54=189$$",['combinatorics']

More generally, if the number of bad computers is at most $k$ (so $n=2k+1$ or $n=2k+2$), I can show that at least $k+1$ questions are needed while $2k-1$ questions suffice. Can anyone narrow that gap? EDIT: starting a bounty, looking for improvements to the lower bound (or the upper bound, though I'd be surprised if the latter is possible) for general $n$.

Can it be that these two statements mean a different kind of 'line'? Any explanation of this, hints, or even a solution would be very appreciated.

115955,Ample line bundles and dimension of a proper variety,"Let $Y$ be a proper variety over a field $k$. Suppose that $\mathcal{L}$ is an ample line bundle on Y and suppose that $\mathcal{L}$ is isomorphic to the trivial bundle. What can I conclude about the dimension of the variety? From the assumption I can (hopefully) deduce that the trivial bundle $\mathcal{O}_Y$ is not only ample: it is indeed very ample (relative to Spec$(k)$), so that there is an immersion $i\colon Y \to \mathbb{P}^n$, for some $r$ such that $\mathcal{O}_Y \cong i^{*}(\mathcal{O}(1))$. My feeling is that this should imply that the variety is affine - that forces the dimension of $Y$ to be $0$, being proper - but I don't see a proof. Thank you!",['algebraic-geometry']

116026,Is $2048$ the highest power of $2$ with all even digits (base ten)?,"I have a friend who turned $32$ recently.  She has an obsessive compulsive disdain for odd numbers, so I pointed out that being $32$ was pretty good since not only is it even, it also has no odd factors.  That made me realize that $64$ would be an even better age for her, because it's even, has no odd factors, and has no odd digits .  I then wondered how many other powers of $2$ have this property.  The only higher power of $2$ with all even digits that I could find was $2048.$ So is there a larger power of $2$ with all even digits?  If not, how would you go about proving it? I tried examining the last $N$ digits of powers of $2$ to look for a cycle in which there was always at least one odd digit in the last $N$ digits of the consecutive powers.  Unfortunately, there were always a very small percentage of powers of $2$ whose last $N$ digits were even. Edit: Here's a little more info on some things I found while investigating the $N$ digit cycles. $N$ : $2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ Cycle length: $20,100,500,2500,12500,62520,312500,1562500,\dotsc, 4\cdot 5^{N-1}$ Number of suffixes with all even digits in cycle: $10, 25, 60, 150, 370, 925, 2310,5780,\sim4\cdot2.5^{N-1}$ It seems there are some interesting regularities there.  Unfortunately, one of the regularities is those occurrences of all even numbers!  In fact, I was able to find a power of $2$ in which the last $33$ digits were even $(2^{3789535319} = \dots 468088628828226888000862880268288)$ . Yes it's true that it took a power of $2$ with over a billion digits to even get the last $33$ to be even, so it would seem any further powers of $2$ with all even digits are extremely unlikely.  But I'm still curious as to how you might prove it. Edit 2: Here's another interesting property I noticed.  The next digit to the left of the last $N$ digits will take on every value of its parity as the $N$ digits cycle each time.  Let me illustrate. The last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers.  Now examine the following: $2^7 =    128$ $2^{27} = \dots 728$ $2^{47} = \dots 328$ $2^{67} = \dots 928$ $2^{87} = \dots 528$ $2^{107} = \dots 128$ Notice that the hundreds place starts out odd and then proceeds to take on every odd digit as the final 2 digits cycle. As another example, let's look at the fourth digit (knowing that the last 3 digits cycle every 100 powers.) $2^{18} = 262144$ , $2^{118} = \dots 6144$ , $2^{218} = \dots 0144$ , $2^{318} = \dots 4144$ , $2^{418} = \dots 8144$ , $2^{518} = \dots 2144$ This explains the power of 5 in the cycle length as each digit must take on all five digits of its parity. EDIT 3: It looks like the $(N+1)$ st digit takes on all the values $0-9$ as the last $N$ digits complete half a cycle.  For instance, the last $2$ digits cycle every $20$ powers, so look at the third digit every $10$ powers: $2^{8}	= 256$ , $2^{18} = \dots 144$ , $2^{28}	= \dots 456$ , $2^{38}	= \dots 944$ , $2^{48}	= \dots 656$ , $2^{58}	= \dots 744$ , $2^{68}	= \dots 856$ , $2^{78}	= \dots 544$ , $2^{88}	= \dots 056$ , $2^{98}	= \dots 344$ Not only does the third digit take on every value 0-9, but it also alternates between odd and even every time (as the Edit 2 note would require.)  Also, the N digits cycle between two values, and each of the N digits besides the last one alternates between odd and even.  I'll make this more clear with one more example which looks at the fifth digit: $2^{20}	= \dots 48576$ , $2^{270}	= \dots 11424$ , $2^{520}	= \dots 28576$ , $2^{770}	= \dots 31424$ , $2^{1020}	= \dots 08576$ , $2^{1270}	= \dots 51424$ , $2^{1520}	= \dots 88576$ , $2^{1770}	= \dots 71424$ , $2^{2020}	= \dots 68576$ , $2^{2270}	= \dots 91424$ EDIT 4: Here's my next non-rigorous observation.  It appears that as the final N digits cycle 5 times, the $(N+2)$ th digit is either odd twice and even three times, or it's odd three times and even twice.  This gives a method for extending an all even suffix. If you have an all even N digit suffix of $2^a$ , and the (N+1) th digit is odd, then one of the following will have the (N+1) th digit even: $2^{(a+1*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+2*4*5^{N-2})}$ , $2^{(a+3*4*5^{N-2})}$ Edit 5: It's looking like there's no way to prove this conjecture solely by examining the last N digits since we can always find an arbitrarily long, all even, N digit sequence.  However, all of the digits are distributed so uniformly through each power of 2 that I would wager that not only does every power of 2 over 2048 have an odd digit, but also, every power of 2 larger than $2^{168}$ has every digit represented in it somewhere. But for now, let's just focus on the parity of each digit.  Consider the value of the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ (with $a_0$ representing the 1's place.) $$
a_k = \left\lfloor\frac{2^n}{10^k}\right\rfloor \text{ mod 10}\Rightarrow a_k = \left\lfloor\frac{2^{n-k}}{5^k}\right\rfloor \text{ mod 10}
$$ We can write $$2^{n-k} = d\cdot5^k + r$$ where $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k}/5^k$ .  So $$
a_k \equiv \frac{2^{n-k}-r}{5^k} \equiv d \pmod{10}
$$ $$\Rightarrow a_k \equiv d \pmod{2}$$ And $$d\cdot5^k = 2^{n-k} - r \Rightarrow d \equiv r \pmod{2}$$ Remember that $r$ is the remainder of $2^{n-k} \text{ div } {5^k}$ so $$\text{The parity of $a_k$ is the same as the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$.}$$ Now we just want to show that for any $2^n > 2048$ we can always find a $k$ such that $2^{n-k} \text{ mod }5^k$ is odd. I'm not sure if this actually helps or if I've just sort of paraphrased the problem. EDIT 6: Thinking about $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ , I realized there's a way to predict some odd digits. $$2^a \pmod{5^k} \text{ is even for } 1\le a< log_2 5^k$$ The period of $2^a \pmod{5^k}$ is $4\cdot5^{k-1}$ since 2 is a primitive root mod $5^k$ .  Also $$2^{2\cdot5^{k-1}} \equiv -1 \pmod{5^k}$$ So multiplying any $2^a$ by $2^{2\cdot5^{k-1}}$ flips its parity mod $5^k$ .  Therefore $2^a \pmod{5^k}\text{ }$ is odd for $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} \le a< 2\cdot5^{k-1} + log_2 5^k$$ Or taking the period into account, $2^a \pmod{5^k} \text{ }$ is odd for any integer $b\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \le a< 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ Now for the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ ( $ k=0 \text{ } $ being the 1's digit), we're interested in the parity of $2^{n-k}$ mod $5^k$ .  Setting $ a =n-k \text{  } $ we see that the $k^{th}$ digit of $2^n$ is odd for integer $b\ge0$ such that $$1 + 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) \le n - k < 2\cdot5^{k-1} (1 + 2b) + log_2 5^k$$ To illustrate, here are some guaranteed odd digits for different $2^n$ : (k=1 digit): $ 2\cdot5^0 + 2 = 4 \le n \le 5 $ (k=2 digit): $ 2\cdot5^1 + 3 = 13 \le n \le 16 $ (k=3 digit): $ 2\cdot5^2 + 4 = 54 \le n \le 59 $ (k=4 digit): $ 2\cdot5^3 + 5 = 255 \le n \le 263 $ Also note that these would repeat every $4\cdot5^{k-1}$ powers. These guaranteed odd digits are not dense enough to cover all of the powers, but might this approach be extended somehow to find more odd digits?

This proof is in the section on the basic limit theorems and definition of continuity, so essentially the only knowledge we have is of the definitions and basic theorems regarding limits.  We have also proved the continuity of indefinite integrals (though it is isn't clear to me how or if to apply that theorem). Geometrically, I believe I understand in a non-rigorous way what is happening, and why it is true.  The quantity on the left is the area between $f(x)$ and the horizontal line at $f(a)$ from $a$ to $b$.  The quantity on the right is the area of the right triangle of base and height $b-a$ (or viewed as an integral it is $\int_a^b x dx$).  The condition on $f$ we are given in the hypothesis of the theorem roughly states that the change in $f$ over any interval must be less than the change in $x$ (or the width of the interval).  So, we have a function $f$ that is changing less than linearly over $[a,b]$; hence, the integral of the function will be $\leq$ than that of $f(x) = x$.
