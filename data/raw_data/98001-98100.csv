1353718,Behavior of a solution of the differential equation,"Suppose we are given function $f:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}$ being twice differentiable. What is more $f$ satisfies: $$(1) \quad f''(x)-5f'(x)+6f(x)\ge0$$ for all $x\in [0,+\infty)$, $f(0)=1$ and $f'(0)=0$. I am asked to prove $f(x)\ge 3e^{2x}-2e^{3x}$. My approache: Let $g(x)=3e^{2x}-2e^{3x}$, than it satisfies all conditions on $f$ with equality in $(1)$. Now if we define $h=f-g$ it satisfies $(1)$, $h(0)=0$,  $h'(0)=0$ and we are forced to show that $h(x) \ge 0$.

1353727,$ y' = x^2 + y^2 $ asymptote,"For the D.E. 
$$ y' = x^2 + y^2 $$
show that the solution with $y(0) = 0$ has a vertical asymptote at some point $x_0$. Try to find upper and lower bounds for $x_0$. I have also been given the hint that a crude estimate for the bounds is 
$$ \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} < x_0 < 2\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} $$
however I am unsure about how to obtain these bounds. My approach so far has been to compare the differential equation above to the equation:
$$y' = 1 + y^2 $$
which we know has the solution of $ y = \tan(x + c) $ and asymptotes at $x = \pm \frac{\pi}{2}$. But apart from that I am stuck.","['bessel-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
1353736,Second Isomorphism Theorem Notation Query,"I'm reading about the Second Isomorphism Theorem and it seems to me as if $HN/N$ should equal $H/N$. Because, $hnN$ is the same as $hN$.

1353738,Semantics of Writing Differential Equations,"Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$, and consider the differential equation
$$
 f'(t) = f(t)
$$
it is easily seen that it has the solutions $f(t) = a\cdot \exp(t)$ for $a \in \mathbb R$. Now another way of writing this
$$
 \frac{df}{dt} = f
$$
(here the argument isn't written anymore, an abstraction step leading to the next notation). Seeing $\frac{df}{dt}$ as a shorthand for $f'(t)$ this is no problem, but I have seen the notation
$$
 \frac{df}{f} = dt.
$$
Suddenly we have two new quantities and $df/dt$ gets handled like a fraction (not just merely a notation for $f'$ anymore), I know this is the Leibniz way of thinking about differentials, and I knew it for example as a shorthand from the substitution rule for integrals. I know how to think about such terms, $dt$ should be interpreted as $t_{i+1} - t_i$ for two time steps or $(t + h) - t$ as the time steps get finer, or $h \to 0$, so $dt \approx h$, similarly $df$ could be understood as $f(t + h) - f(t)$ in the limit, so $df \approx f(t+h) - f(t)$ for $h$ sufficiently small at $t$. But how should $df / f = dt$ be read, as ""the proportion of the change in quantity to the total quantity equals the change in time, i.e. for constant time changes it is constant too, which implies that if the quantity increases, the rate of change has to increase too."" But with substituting
$$
 df \approx (\exp(t + h) - \exp(t)) \mbox{ and }
 dt \approx (t + h) - t
$$
we should have
$$
 \frac{\exp(t + h) - \exp(t)}{\exp(t+h)} = h
$$
as $\exp(t+h) - \exp(t) \approx \exp(t+h)h$ (i.e. $df = fdt$)
which is not valid, because $(\exp(t + h) - \exp(t))/\exp(t+h) = 1 - \exp(-h) \ne h$? So where is the problem, why does this interpretation does not work?","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'derivatives']"

As far as I know we can define $X=\text {Spec} R$ to be an affine scheme for any commutative ring $R$. If we choose $R=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ do we still get a ""reasonable"" picture of the geometry of $X$, or is the non-noetherian case always somewhat more abstract than the ""classical"" picture of algebraic sets in finite affine space? From what I was reading, any open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover ($\text {Spec} R$ is quasi-compact). Does this still hold if $R$ is not noetherian?

I was trying to conclude that $G$ must be abelian (I am not sure about this). I proceed as follows: if $|G|\leq 4$, then obviously, $G$ is abelian. Suppose $|G|>4$. Then consider products of all elements in the order $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab cc^{-1}dd^{-1}....$. This, being identity, implies that $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=1$, i.e. $G$ is abelian. BUT, the problem is in $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab$, the elements $a$ and $a^{-1}$ should be distinct, and similarly for $b$. Otherwise, the product $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab cc^{-1}dd^{-1}....$ is not in the prescribed form as in question.

1353946,Why is the solution of a stochastic differential equation wrt the Brownian motion suitable for a model of a disturbed time continuous process,"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ be a probability space $\mathbb F=(\mathcal F_t)_{t\ge 0}$ be a filtration on $(\Omega,\mathcal A)$ $B=(B_t)_{t\ge 0}$ be a Brownian motion on $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ with respect to $\mathbb F$ $H=(H_t)_{t\ge 0}$ be $\mathbb F$-adapted and $\mathbb F$-progressively measurable with $$\operatorname E\left[\int_0^\infty H_t^2\right]<\infty$$ Under this conditions, the Itô integral of $H$ with respect to $B$ $$\int_0^\infty H_s\;dB_s$$ is well-defined. Now, let $b,\sigma:[0,\infty)\times\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ be Borel measurable and suppose we are considering a ""process"" $X=(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ whose local behavior in time can be described by a differential equation $$dX_t=b\left(t,X_t\right)dt\;.\tag{1}$$ However, maybe $(1)$ is not accurate cause the process is disturbed by a random influence. The Brownian motion at time $t$ is $\mathcal N_{0,\;t}$-distributed and the increments $B_t-B_s$ are $\mathcal N_{0,\;t-s}$-distributed. So, since the normal distribution occurs almost naturally in many practical problems, it makes sense to me, that we somehow want to integrate $X$ by $B$ and add this term to $(1)$. Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration would make perfectly sense to me. The integration interval would be weighted by a normally distributed factor (the increments of the Brownian motion). However, we all know that Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration with the Brownian motion as the integrator is impossible. So, we use the Itô integral and model our problem by $$dX_t=b(t,X_t)dt+\sigma(t,X_t)dB_t\tag{2}\;.$$ While I know, that the Itô integral has beautiful properties like being a continuous $\mathbb F$-martingale, I ask myself in which terms $(2)$ is still appropriate for our problem. Let $X$ be the solution of $(2)$. How can we motivate, that $X$ is really a solution for our problem? $X$ should be the solution of $(1)$ (which is the perfect model function without any disturbance) plus some normally distributed distortion whose intensity depends on $\sigma$. Honestly, I don't see that $X$ has this property.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-integrals', 'stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion']"

1354148,Proving the formula for finding the determinant of a square matrix.,"I have read the proof for finding the determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix.

$(ad-bc)$ must be non-zero for the inverse of the matrix to exist. So it is logical that $(ad-bc)$ is the determinant.

However, unlike the $2 \times 2$ matrix determinant formula, no proof is given. Similarly, the formula for the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix is not given in my textbook.

1354274,Why does it suffice to check the geodesic equation to leading order?,"I am reading Taubes's book on differential geometry and am wondering about a proof. My apologies if this is simple, as I'm still grappling with the material. My question concerns material in chapter 8, page 83. Embed $S^n$ into $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ as the set of points with $|x|=1$. Pulling back the standard metric on $\mathbb R$ gives a metric on $S^n$ called the round metric. Taubes asserts the geodesic equation for a curve $\gamma: \mathbb R \rightarrow S^n \subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with coordinates $(x^i(t))$ is given by
$$\ddot x^j + x^j|\dot x|^2=0.$$ To show this, he introduces the map $y\rightarrow (y, (1-|y|^2)^{1/2})$ from $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R^n \times \mathbb R$ that embeds the ball of radius $1$ into $S^n$. Pulling back the round metric gives 
$$g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + y_i y_j(1-|y|^2)^{-1}.$$
(This expression fixes a typo found in the book and pointed out here. ) Expanding in a power series and writing out the geodesic equation gives 
$$\ddot y+y_j|\dot y|^2 +O(|y|^2)=0.$$ Taubes asserts that since this matches the original equation to leading order in $y$, the claim is proved. Why is this? That is, why does it suffices to check that the equations agree to leading order?
His justification, which I do not understand, is: This agrees with what is written above to leading order in y. Since the metric and the sphere are invariant under rotations of
  $S^n$, as is the equation for $x$ above, this verifies the equation at
  all points. Presumably the second sentence is just referring to the face that, by symmetry, it suffices to verify the equation for the given coordinate patch, but perhaps there is more I am missing. I am also confused because the equation in $y$ is in $\mathbb R^n$, but the equation in $x$ is in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$.

Proof that $A_n$ is countable. (Hint: For each $m \in \mathbb{N}$, consider polynomials with $\sum_{i=0}^n |a_i| \leq m$. My main problem is that I don't understand why $\sum_{i=0}^n |a_i|$ should be $\leq m$ and not equal to $m$. I would go as follows: Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Then there are only finitely many polynomials of degree $n$ having integer coefficients satisfying $\sum_{i=0}^n |a_i| = m$, because there are only finitely many ways how the coefficients can be chosen. Hences, let $n_m$ be the number of these polynomials, and let $S^m_i$ be the set of solutions of the $i$th of such polynomials, $1 \leq i \leq n_m$. Since a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ solutions, $S^m_i$ is finite for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $1 \leq i \leq n_m$. Then, $S^m = \cup_{i=1}^{n_m} S^m_i$ is finite.

1354333,Maximal geodesics on compact manifolds,"I have two questions about the following passage in Taubes's book on differential geometry. I also quote the proposition it references. 9.1 The maximal extension of a geodesic Let $I \subset R$ denote a closed interval that is not the whole of $R$, and let $s$ denote an end point of
  $I$, for the sake of the discussion, the maximum point. Let $\gamma: I \rightarrow M$
  denote a geodesic. It follows from Proposition 8.3 that there exists
  an extension of $\gamma$ to an interval with maximal endpoint $s + \epsilon$ for some
  $\epsilon > 0$. To see this, take a point $q =\gamma (s')$ for $s'$ nearly $s$. Then $q$
  is very close to $p =\gamma (s)$. Proposition 8.3 tells us that the
  geodesic $t \rightarrow \gamma_q(t) = \gamma(s'+ t)$ is defined for $|t|<\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon$
  that depends only on p. This extends $\gamma$. It follows as a consequence
  that each geodesic in $M$ has a maximum extension. In particular, if $M$
  is compact, then each geodesic extends as a geodesic mapping $R$ into $M$. Proposition 8.3 Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $g$ denote a Riemannian metric on $M$. Let $p\in M$ and let $v \in TM|_p$. There
  exists $\epsilon>0$ and a unique map from the interval $(-\epsilon,
 \epsilon)$ to $M$ that obeys the geodesic equation, sends $0$ to $p$,
  and whose differential at $0$ sends the vector $d/dt$ to $v$. How is this extension argument valid? The argument claims that $\epsilon$ depends only on the endpoint of the interval $I$, but in proposition $8.3$, $\epsilon$ depends on the point $0$ is being mapped to. Here, that is $s'$. I'm lost on the details of the argument here and would appreciate any clarification you could provide. Why does it follow from the fact that geodesics have maximal extensions that geodesics on compact manifolds have extensions to all of $\mathbb R$?","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry', 'geodesic']"

At the first turn you can put as many coins as you like on the weighing device and it will tell you exactly how much they weigh. However, there is something really strange about the weighing device.  If you put coins $x_1, x_2, ..., x_j$ on the device the first time, then the next time you have to put coins $(x_1+1), (x_2+1) , ..., (x_j+1) $ on the scale with the except that you of course can't put on a coin numbered higher than $n-1$.   Not only that, for every new weighing you get to choose if you want to put coin $0$ on the scale. In other words, all the weighings are defined by the choice of coins you choose to weigh the first time and the decision for every successive weighing about whether to add coin $0$ as well. We want to separate the lighter coins from the heavier coins just by performing a number of weighings. We can express our choices for each weighing as a matrix.  Now we know, for example, that if we have $14$ coins it is possible to separate the two sets in only $8$ weighings as follows. $$

So my thought is to somehow use the MVP since the methods of Liouville and Max/Min Modulus Principle don't look promising. I just don't see how to connect the above and $$f(0)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(re^{i\theta}) d\theta,$$ where $0<r<1.$

1354428,"Why can a closed, bounded interval be uncountable?","From what I have read, all finite sets are countable but not all countable sets are finite. As I understand it, Countably Finite --- a one to one map onto $\Bbb{N}$ with a limited number of members Countably Infinite --- a one to one map onto $\Bbb{N}$ with an unlimited number of members but that you can count in principle if given an infinite amount of time Uncountably Infinite --- there is no one to one mapping onto $\Bbb{N}$. Even if you count, you will miss some of the members. And it is infinite. From this I gather that countable is not the same as finite. Countable is the one to one property with $\Bbb{N}$. Finite just means a limited number of elements. Now consider $[0,1]$ which is closed and bounded. Bounded --- $\forall k \in [0,1]$ we have $k \leq 1$. Similarly all $k\geq0$. Closed --- it contains the endpoints $0$ and $1$ Yet I read $[0,1]$ is uncountably infinite. So clearly, neither closure nor boundedness implies finiteness or countability. Question: Why can a closed, bounded interval be uncountable? It just seems like something that is bounded would be ""more finite"" than something that isn't.","['real-numbers', 'elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

2. The number of items in a treasure chest
3.

I am interested in computing a normalized version of the mutual information which takes a value in $[0,1]$ and is defined as the proportion of reduction in entropy of $X$ once the realization of $Y$ is known, i.e. $$I'(X;Y) = \frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X)}$$ Are there any references in the literature which use this normalized version $I'(X;Y)$ (which is obviously not symmetric)? The reason I am interested in this question is to use mutual information to compare the strength of dependencies between random variables (parallel to how correlation is a normalization of covariance for measuring the strength of linear dependence). If $I(X,Y) = 4$ and $I(W,Z)$ = 1000, this alone does not facilitate a comparison about the relative strength of dependency (are $(X,Y)$ or $(W,Z)$ more strongly dependent?) without knowing the entropies of $X,Y,W,Z$.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'statistics', 'information-theory']"

I have found that the splitting field is $\mathbb{Q}(i, \sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2})=\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{28})$. Edit: (Justifying the splitting field stated above) The roots of the polynomial are $\sqrt[4]{7}\big(\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\pm i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\big)$ so the spliting field is $E=\mathbb{Q}\bigg(\sqrt[4]{7}\big(\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\pm i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\big) \bigg)=\mathbb{Q}\bigg(\sqrt[4]{7}(\pm\sqrt{2}\pm i\sqrt{2} ) \bigg)$. We have $\sqrt[4]{7}(\sqrt{2}+i\sqrt{2}) \in E$ and $(\sqrt[4]{7}(\sqrt{2}-i\sqrt{2}) \in E$, hence their sum $=2\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2} \in E \implies \sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2} \in E$. Then we also have $\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2}+i\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2}-\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2} = i\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2} \in E \implies \frac{i\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2}}=i \in E$. So $\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt{4}\sqrt{7}) \subseteq E$. But all of the roots of $x^{4}+7$ are contained in $\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2})$ so we in fact have $E=\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{7}\sqrt{2})=\mathbb{Q}(i,\sqrt[4]{28})$.

This question stems from Stillwell's Naive Lie Theory where he states that a quaternion $t$ of absolute value $1$, has a real part and an imaginary part (in $\mathbb{R}i+\mathbb{R}j+\mathbb{R}k$).

$$

$$
where $0<\delta \ll 1$, and $a$, $b$, $C$, $K$ and  are all positive. Is it possible to obtain some constant bound on the process $x$? Comment: Note that first equation alone is not enough. $x$ can stay close to zero for a long time and then increase to a large value abruptly so that $x_t$ is large and $\int x_s^2$ is near zero and both add up close to $x_0+\delta+bt$. This way we only get that $x_t<x_0+\delta+bt$. The second equation does not allow such a rapid rise of $x$. Gronwall kind of inequalities are not helpful because they assume $C<0$. Motivation: Consider $y\geq 0$ satisfying
$$
\dot{y}_t=-Cy_t^2+b.
$$
Then it is easy to see that $y_t\leq \max\{y_0,\sqrt{b/C}\}$. Instead, if $y$ satisfied 
$$
\dot{y}_t \leq -Cy_t^2+b.
$$
then a comparison principle would give same answer $y_t\leq \max\{y_0,\sqrt{b/C}\}$. Now consider a process $z\geq 0$ satisfying
$$
\dot{z}_t \leq -Cz_t^2+b + G(z_t,t/\epsilon),

where $\epsilon\ll 1$ and $G$ as a function of its second argument is periodic with mean zero, and as a function of its first argument has atmost quadratic dependence. Using the fact that $G$ has atmost quadratic dependence in $z$ we get the second equation of the question . The effect of $G$ on $\dot{z}$ is a very rapid mean zero oscillation. So if we consider integral form of the above equation and approximate the effect of $\int G$ (and assume some other things) then we get the form of the first equation of the question .","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'integral-inequality']"

  $[0,1],$ and $m$ is the Lebesgue measure. Let $f$ be some function s.t. $$\int_a^b f dm =b-a,$$

Thus we have for any $[a,b]\subseteq[0,1]$ $$\mu([a,b])=b-a.$$ I want to show $f=1$ [m] a.e., and I think good way to go about this would be to show $m=\mu.$ Now if we consider the set $L,$ which is where the Lebesgue measure and $\mu$ agree we have that $I,$ the set of intervals is contained in the former, i.e. $I\subseteq L.$ Now I is clearly a $\pi$ system and $L$ is a $\lambda$ system, which means by Dynkin's Theorem $\sigma(I)=\mathcal{B}\subseteq L,$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel sets on $[0,1].$ Now this would give me that $\mu=m,$ but only on the Borel sets, and hence I can't say that $m=\mu$ on $\mathcal{M}.$ Is this correct or am I missing something?

1354864,Proof verification of a weak version of Bezout's Theorem,"I'd like to make sure here that my reasoning seems sound. I am working from Kirwan's book on algebraic curves. I was not totally happy with her proof of this theorem, so I wanted to see if I could rework it. The simplicity of my proof suggests I've forgotten some important details. In particular, the original proof required that we change coordinates so that the point [0 : 0 : 1] was on neither curve, nor did it lie on any line defined by any two points of intersection. So please correct any mistakes, since I'm still learning this :) Theorem. Given any two projective curves $P$ and $Q$ in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ of degrees $n$ and $m$ respectively which do not share a component, they meet at no more than $nm$ points. By a projective change of coordinates, we can assume that all points of intersection are finite . (That is, they do not lie on the line at infinity, $z=0$ ). I'm fairly sure this is easy enough to do by sending the line at infinity to any other line, as long as you're careful about what gets mapped to the point at infinity on the new line. Even if there is an error in the proof elsewhere, this seems like a productive thing to do since we can now work in affine space. Momentarily considering $P$ and $Q$ as elements of the ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y][z]$ and define their resultant with respect to $z$ , $R(x,y)$ . Because $P$ and $Q$ are homogeneous polynomials in $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ , we can show that $R(x,y)$ is homogeneous and of degree $nm$ . (This is a lemma Kirwan front-loads and proves at the end of the section). And so, we can factor $R(x,y)$ as $\kappa(\lambda_1 y - \mu_1 x) \dots (\lambda_{nm} y - \mu_{nm} x)$ . Notably, it has exactly $nm$ factors. Suppose $[\alpha : \beta : 1]$ is a common point of intersection. (We can assume the third compontent is $1$ since all such points are finite points). Then, as polynomials in $\mathbb{C}[\alpha, \beta][z]$ , $P(\alpha, \beta, z)$ and $Q(\alpha,\beta, z)$ have a common zero (namely, when $z=1$ ) and so $R(\alpha, \beta)$ must be zero, and so consequently, $\alpha y - \beta x$ must be a factor of $R(x, y)$ . Finally, suppose that that we have at least $nm + 1$ distinct points of intersection: $[\alpha_1 : \beta_1 : 1] \dots [\alpha_{nm+1} : \beta_{nm+1} : 1]$ . By the above argument, this makes $\alpha_i y - \beta_i x$ must be a factor of $R(x, y)$ for each $i$ . But this gives us at least $nm + 1$ distinct factors, while we counted exactly $nm$ earlier. This is a contradiction and ends our proof.","['projective-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'solution-verification', 'algebraic-curves']"

1354911,Questions about Affine algebraic group scheme over an infinite field K,"For an easily comprehension of my questions I write some definitions: An affine algebraic group scheme over $K$ is a representable group-functor from $K$-algebras category, with a finitely generated representing algebra. An affine algebraic group over a $K$ is an affine algebraic variety with polynomials of definition having coefficients in $K$ equipped with a group structure compatible with the variety structure. I know that every affine algebraic group over an infinite $K$ is equivalent to some affine algebraic group scheme over $K$. I try to show if the converse is true but in my reference i can't read anithing helpful. Can, some one, give me a hint to show that the converse is true or not? I try to work with the rispective topologies but i'm confusing about topology over an affine algebraic group scheme. 
If i have $G : \mathcal{Alg}_K \longrightarrow \mathcal{Grp}$ representable with $A=K[X_1, \ldots , X_n]/I$, the isomorphism $G(K) \simeq Hom_K(A,K)$ allow me to equip G(K) with a topology?

See for instance Mapping $\mathbb{F}_1$-land for an overview. In combinatorics, the notion of a q-analog has a structural interpretation only when $q$ is a prime power (now including $q=1$), which is kind of awkward. Question. Can you think of a reasonable notion of a ""generalized field"" such that, for every natural number $q \geq 1$ there is a ""generalized field"" $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ ""elements""? Here are some minimal requirements: The category of fields should have a fully faithful functor to the category of generalized fields. If $q$ is a prime power, then this embedding should map $\mathbb{F}_q$ to $\mathbb{F}_q$. Every $\mathbb{F}_q$-""module"" should be free. There should be a morphism $\mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_{q'}$ if and only if $v_p(q)|v_p(q')$ for each prime $p$.

x_{1} = \pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 2\pi n: n \in \mathbb{Z}\\
x_{2} = \pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 2\pi n: n \in \mathbb{Z}
$$ Wolfram Alpha, here the link , instead, gives the following results: $
x_{1} = 2\pi n - 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}}) : n \in \mathbb{Z}\\
x_{2} = 2\pi n + 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}}) : n \in \mathbb{Z}
$ Now, supposing that my solutions are correct, this means that there must be a relation between: $\pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3})$ and $- 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})$ or between: $\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3})$ and $+ 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})$ or viceversa. But, given the solutions I have found, how can I prove that they are effectively the same as the solutions Wolfram found? Mathematically? P.S.: I have found out, by looking at the graphs of $y_{1} = \pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3})$ and $y_{2} = 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})$ e.g., that: $\pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) = 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})$ Then, of course: 
$\pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 2\pi = 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ 2\pi \\
\pi - \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 4\pi = 2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ 4\pi \\
... every\,\,360°n, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ And that: $\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) = -2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ 2\pi\\
\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 2\pi = -2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ 4\pi\\
\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + 4\pi = -2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ 6\pi\\
...
\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + (n - 2)\pi = -2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}})+ n\pi\\
$ So we can say that $\pi + \arccos(\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}) + (n - 2)\pi$ differs from $-2\arctan(\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{6}}) + n\pi$ by just one lap ($2\pi$), otherwise they can be safely considered the same (for all integers).

1355000,Invariant subspaces of Lie group vs invariant subspaces of Lie algebra,"I am starting to study infinite-dimensional representations of Lie groups and I am wondering about the following: Let $G$ be a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and with a representation $\Phi: G \to \text{GL}(V)$ , with $V$ finite-dimensional.

I am struggling to see why and how exactly is this statement wrong for infinite-dimensional representations? I do not see where the proof does not carry over. Also, what are easy illustrative (counter-)examples and what does it mean for a Lie algebra representation to be integrable? Edit: On a second thought, could it be that in the infinite-dimensional case, the function $g \mapsto \Phi(g)v$ will not be differentiable for all $v \in V$ and thus we can not that easily differentiate our Lie group representation to a Lie algebra representation? Then my additional question is: where does the proof that a continuous Lie group homomorphism is automatically smooth, does not carry over?

1355007,Fiber dimension theorem for locally closed sets,"I want to prove (or to find a reference to) the following statement: Statement: Let $Z$ be an irreducible locally closed set (Zariski topology) of $\mathbb C^n$ and $\pi$ be a projection on the first $l$ coordinates (the values of $l$ is not important).
Assume  that there exists $d$ such that $\dim\pi^{-1}(\pi(z))\geq d$ for all $z\in Z$. Then 
$$
\dim \pi(Z)\leq \dim Z - d.\ \ \ \ \ \ (1)
$$ I found several versions of the fiber dimension theorem, but they cannot be applied directly to my case since $Z$ is always assumed to be  a variety. For example, Theorem 3.7 on p.78 in Perrin D., Algebraic Geometry.. an introduction, Springer 2008 says (I omit statement 1)) Theorem 3.7 Let $\phi:\ X\rightarrow Y$ be a dominant morphism of irreducible algebraic varieties. Then
 there exists a non-empty open set $U\subset Y$ such that a) $U\subset \phi(X)$ b) $\forall y\in U$, $\dim \phi^{-1}(y)=\dim X-\dim Y$. Question: Is the following derivation of the statement above from Theorem 3.7 correct? Since $Z$ is a locally closed set, there exist polynomials $p_1,\dots,p_k$ and $q_1,\dots,q_m$ in $n$ variables such that
$$
Z=\{z\in\mathbb C^n:\ p_1(z)=\dots=p_k(z)=0\ \text{ and }\ q_1(z)\ne 0\ \text{ or }\ q_2(z)\ne 0\ \text{ or } \  \dots q_m(z)\ne 0\}.
$$
Since $Z$ is irreducible, $m=1$, that is 
$$
Z=\{(z_1,\dots,z_n):\ p_1(z_1,\dots,z_n)=\dots=p_k(z_1,\dots,z_n)=0\ \text{ and }\ q(z_1,\dots,z_n)\ne 0\}.
$$
We extend $Z$ to a Zariski closed subset $\widetilde{Z}\subset \mathbb C^{n+1}$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\widetilde{Z}=\{(z_1,\dots,z_n, z_{n+1}):\ &p_1(z_1,\dots,z_n)=\dots=p_k(z_1,\dots,z_n)=0\ \text{ and }\\ &z_{n+1}q(z_1,\dots,z_n)=1\}.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
It is clear $Z=\pi_{1,\dots,n}\widetilde{Z}$ (projection onto the first $n$ coordinates). On the other hand,
$\widetilde{Z}$ is the image of $Z$ under the mapping $(z_1,\dots,z_n)\in Z\mapsto (z_1,\dots,z_n,\frac{1}{q(z_1,\dots,z_n)})\in\widehat{Z}$.
Hence, $\dim Z=\dim\widetilde{Z}$. Thus, we can apply Theorem 3.7.",['algebraic-geometry']
