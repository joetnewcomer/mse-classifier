604654,Estimating the entropy,"Given a discrete random variable $X$, I would like to estimate the entropy of $Y=f(X)$ by sampling. I can sample uniformly from $X$. The samples are just random vectors of length $n$ where the entries are $0$ or $1$.  For each sample vector $x_i$, I can then compute the function $f(x_i)$ which itself is a vector.  A naive method is to run this process for as long as time allows and then to take the collection of $f(x_i)$ vectors and compute its entropy by making a histogram of how frequently each vector has occurred. This however doesn't seem a good estimate. In particular, the sample space for $Y$ is exponential in $n$ and so I am very likely never to have seen any samples with low probability.  This will mean I may grossly underestimate the entropy I think. The size of the vectors $n$ will typically be at most $100$ and is known. Is there an unbiased estimator for the entropy? Or alternatively, Is there an estimator with lower variance?","['statistics', 'information-theory', 'entropy']"

604779,"Show that $f, f^{-1}$ are continuous","Let $A,B \subset \mathbb{R}$ be open, and $f:A\rightarrow B$ be surjective and strictly monotonic increasing. Show that $f,f^{-1}$ are continuous. Proof: I first show $f$ is injective. Let $x,y \in A, \mbox{and } x\neq y.$ This means either $x<y \mbox{  or } y<x.$ As $f$ is monotonic increasing, $f(x)<f(y) \mbox{ or }f(y)<f(x).\Rightarrow f(x)\neq f(y)\Rightarrow f$ is injective. This shows $f$ is bijective. To show $f$ is continuous, let $D \subset B$ be open. I need to show $f^{-1}(D)$ is open in $A$. Suppose not, i.e., $(f^{-1}(D))^{c}$ is not closed. $\quad\Rightarrow \exists$ a sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ in  $(f^{-1}(D))^{c}$ that converges to $x$ which is in $f^{-1}(D)$. As $f$ is bijective, $\exists$ a unique $y_n,y$ for each $x_n$ such that $f(x_n)=y_n,f(x)=y,\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $(y_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is in $D^{c}, y\in D$. Here, $y_n\rightarrow y$. If it does not, this means $f^{-1}(y_n)=x_n$ does not converge to $f^{-1}(y)=x$, contradiction.  $\quad \Rightarrow D^c$ is not closed. $\Rightarrow D$ is not open. Contradiction. $f^{-1}$ can also be proved to be continuous in the same way as above. I somehow get a feeling that I am not allowed to argue $y_n \rightarrow y$ because a priori, my argument, which I think, assumes $f$ is continuous, which I have not proven yet! Is my proof correct or my doubt? Please help me get out of this situation!","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

604820,A problem with the geometric series and matrices?,"Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $A$ be a square matrix. Let $I$ be the identity matrix with the same size as $A$. I want to simplify $f_n(A) = I + A + A^2 + A^3 + A^4 + \cdots + A^n$ Now I know that for a complex number $z$ we have $1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 + \cdots + z^n= \dfrac{z^{n+1}-1}{z-1}$ when $z$ is not equal to $1$ ... and even if $z=1$ then by computing the limit we get the right answer : $n+1$.
This is well known as the geometric series and leads to the so-called q-analogue ideas. But for matrices $A$ this does not work if the determinant of $A-I$ is $0$ , because then $\dfrac{A^{n+1} - I}{A - I}$ is not well defined. This frustrates me a lot. Now I have heard about pseudoinverses but I do not know much about them and I even wonder if they can be of any help here.

604824,Can this ant find its way back to the nest?,"So the puzzle is like this: An ant is out from its nest searching for food. It travels in a straight line from its nest. After this ant gets 40 ft away from the nest, suddenly a rain starts to pour and washes away all its scent trail. This ant has the strength of traveling 280 ft more then it will starve to death. Suppose this ant's nest is a huge wall and this ant can travel in a whatever curve it wants, how can this ant find its way back? I interpret it as: I start at the origin. I know that there is a straight line with distance 40 ft to the origin, but I don't know the direction. In what parametric curve I will sure hit the line when the parameter $t$ is increasing, while the total arc length is less than or equal to 280 ft. I asked a friend of mine who is a PhD in math, he told me this is a calculus of variation problem. I wonder if I could use basic calculus stuff to solve this puzzle (I have learned ODE as well). My hunch tells me that a spiral should be used as the path, yet I am not sure what kind of spiral to use here. Any hint shall be appreciated. Thanks dudes!

604861,Convergence in norm!,"Let $f_n(x)=\sqrt{n}e^{-nx}$ for $x\in \Omega=(0,1).$
Question: Does $\int_{\Omega}f_n(x)h(x)dx\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ for each $h(x)\in L^1(\Omega)?$. My intuition is that this is not true, but I cannot find a counterexample or prove if this is the case. 
If it helps, I have already shown that $$||f_n||_{L^2(\Omega)}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$$ as $n\rightarrow \infty.$ Also I have shown that $$\int_{\Omega}f_n(x)g(x)dx\rightarrow 0$$ for each $g\in L^2(\Omega).$ $\Large {\bf Edited}$ So I know I claimed above that I have shown that $$\int_{\Omega}f_n(x)g(x)dx\rightarrow 0$$ for each $g\in L^2(\Omega),$ but upon a closer look I am a little confused, and I cannot seem to resolve the confusion. My original thought was as follows: I could show that the statement is true for every monomial. Then, using a similar logic, I could show that $$\int_{\Omega}f_n(x)P_k(x)dx\rightarrow 0,$$ where $P_k(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $k$. Then, using the fact that every measurable function can be approximated with a continuous function, and the latter with polynomials, I could show that the statement holds in its full generality. There are two things that are confusing me: First, why isn't the same logic working in the $L^1$ case? There must be some subtle difference here, but I cannot seem to see it. Second, each of these functions $f_n\in L^2(\Omega)$ defines a bounded linear functional $F:L^2(\Omega)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where $$F_n(g)=\int_{\Omega}f_ng.$$ In Royden (ch. 6, pp 131) they show that $||F_n||=||f_n||_{L^2}.$ But as $n\rightarrow \infty$ this does not approach zero, so wouldn't this imply that there is at least some function $g\in L^2(\Omega)$ for which the statement is wrong??

604919,solution set in $\mathbb{C}$ of $ z^{\frac1{z}}=\left(\frac1{z}\right)^z$,"If $z \in \mathbb{C}$ what can be said about the solution set of:
$$
z^{\frac1{z}}=\left(\frac1{z}\right)^z
$$
aside from the fact that it contains the fourth roots of unity? I will add as a footnote something that I only realized whilst reading through the comments, that the symmetry of the problem suggests examining the intersection of two sets in $\mathbb{C}^2$ defined by:
$$
z^w = w^z
$$
and
$$
wz = 1
$$ further footnote: one small bit of progress is to see what happens if $z=e^{i\theta}$ with $\theta$ real and $ -\pi \le \theta \lt \pi$. plugging this value in gives:
$$
\theta \cos \theta = n \pi
$$
so for $n=0$ either $\theta =0$ or $\cos \theta =0$, and if $n=1$ then $\theta = -\pi$ so this is a derivation of the four solutions satisfying $z^4 = 1$ which were already fairly obvious by ""inspection"". I am very lacking in knowledge of complex analysis, so perhaps someone with more experience can determine if each of these solutions is an isolated zero, or if there is some way of showing that for any or all of them other solutions can be found in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood - i.e. the four solutions on the unit circle might be points of accumulation of a larger set of solutions. for example if we are very near $z=1$ we may (naively) set $z=1+dz$ and $\frac1{z}=1-dz$ so the constraint requires:
$$
(1+dz)^{1-dz}=(1-dz)^{1+dz}
$$
or
$$
\frac{1+dz}{1-dz} = (1-dz^2)^{dz}
$$ 
applying the binomial theorem in a simplistic way gives $dz=0$, but since the functions $(1+dz)^{-dz}=(1-dz)^{dz}$ are (?) for general complex values of $dz$ infinitely many-valued, this naive analysis may not rule out something like a series of solutions lying on a set of spirals converging around $z=1$. however this is little more than hand-waving, and i am out of my depth, so unable to take such an argument further.","['roots', 'complex-analysis']"

Instead of answering, he told me to determine which form of numbers of the new paper should we solve this week.

It seems to me from the definition, that order to have a notion of ""almost sure convergence"" we must have a sequence of random variables $X_i$ on the same probability space; at the same time $\overline{X}_n$ is a random variable on the product of probability spaces of the first $n$ of the $X_i$'s. Of course we can think of all $\overline{X}_k$'s as living on the $n$'th product for $k \leq n$, but to consider all $n$ at the same time, we would have to have an infinite product.

Let $d_A = d+A$ be a covariant derivative on $E$. It is an $\mathbb R$-linear map $d_A \colon \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$. Then the formal adjoint map $d_A^*$ acts from $\Gamma(T^*M \otimes E^*)$ to $\Gamma(E^*)$. But how to find explicitely this map? I know the answer but I don't know how to obtain it. If we had $\Gamma(T^*M \otimes E^*) \cong \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$ and $\Gamma(E^*) \cong \Gamma(E)$ and if we had scalar products defined on these two spaces then I could obtain the answer starting from the formula $\langle d_A s, \omega \rangle = \langle s, d_A^* \omega \rangle$, where $s \in \Gamma(E)$, $\omega \in \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$ and $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ are corresponding scalar products, but it's not so clear for me what to do in the case when we have no scalar products in these spaces. I think that we need to give some sense to $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. Given $(s,v) \in \Gamma(E) \times\Gamma(E^*)$ we can define $\bigl(v(s)\bigr)_x = v_x(s_x)$ to be a $C^\infty$-function on $M$ so we can define $\langle s, v \rangle = \langle v(s) \rangle_{L_2(M)}$. On the other hand, given $(\omega \otimes s, \eta \otimes v) \in \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E) \times \Gamma(T^* M \otimes E^*)$ (locally)  we can define $\langle \omega \otimes s, \eta \otimes v\rangle = \int_M v(s) \omega \wedge *\eta$ and using these two expressions for $\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ we can find formal adjoints as in the case of scalar product spaces.

605435,Evaluate spatial variation of density-like scalar,"Apologies if this has been asked previously, but I'm not totally sure of the best way to pose the question. Background I'm evaluating the variation of a spatially varying scalar field $p$ (specifically, the density of power) across a domain. As a first step, I simply integrated this field over several relevant subdomains, and divided by their volume to get the average density in those subdomains. For example, for a subdomain I'll call A:
$$
p_A = \frac{\int_A p dV}{\int_A dV}
$$
I then compared the differences of the average density between regions. Question As a better way of considering the overall 'spread' of the density values, not sensitive to my choice of regions, I would like to evaluate the variance of the power density $p$. Presently, I am evaluating this as:
$$
\text{Var}(p) = \text{E}(p^2) - (\text{E}(p))^2 
              = \frac{\int_\Omega p^2 dV}{\int_\Omega dV} - \left( \frac{\int_\Omega p dV}{\int_\Omega dV} \right)^2
$$
where $\Omega$ represents the whole domain in question. I would like to know: Is this a correct representation of the variance of this scalar field? How can I relate this calculation with a more 'pure' statistical definition of variance, such as:
$$
\text{Var}(X) = \int (x-\mu )^2 f(x) dx
$$
I believe I have a conceptual understanding of what the probability density function $f(x)$ represents in this case, but am unsure how it can be written down as an equation. I considered writing it as an integral of $p$ over the domain, including a multiplicative factor such as the Dirac delta function in the integrand to 'knock out' desired values, but am uneasy about the rationale for doing so. Something like:
$$
f(x) = \int_\Omega \delta (x - p) dV

The definition given in my notes is that given an action $\sigma: G\times X\rightarrow X$ of an algebraic group $G$ and a line bundle $\pi:L\rightarrow X$, a linearization of $\sigma$ is an extension to an action $\bar{\sigma}: G\times L\rightarrow L$ that commutes with $\sigma$ via the projection $\pi$. I understand the definition, but do not see why we do this/how it helps us construct quotients.

605570,Einstein Notation for product of stacked matrices,"Background Information: I recently started using the Einstein summation notation to express certain operations over an ""image"" $\mathbf{A}$ where to each pixel a square matrix is attached.

Now, if I want to represent the multiplication of each ""submatrix"" $A_{pq}$ of size $n \times n$ by a matrix $\mathbf{B}$ of compatible size, I can express it as: $A^{'}_{pqij} = B_{ik}A_{pqkj}$. The problem: I have an array $\mathbf{B}$ of the same size as $\mathbf{A}$ and I want to compute a third array $\mathbf{A}^{'}$ where each pixel $\mathbf{A}_{pix}^{'}$ at the first two indices $p$ and $q$ corresponds to the matrix multiplication of matrix $\mathbf{A}_{pix}$ with $\mathbf{B}_{pix}$ in array $\mathbf{B}$ at the same indices $p$ and $q$. In the notation of linear algebra, for each $n \times n$ matrix indicized by $p$ and $q$ I want: $A_{pix}^{'} = B_{pix}A_{pix}$ Attempt : I initially tried something of the form:
$A_{mnloij}^{'} = B_{mnik}A_{lokj}$
but if I think this will compute the submatrix multiplication at all combinations of indices $m,l,n,o$. The Question in Brief: Is there a way, using the Einstein summation notation, to compute the sum: $A_{pqij}^{'} = B_{mnik}A_{lokj}$ for the combinations of indices where $(m,n)=(l,o)=\left(p,q\right)$ only? Additional Attempt: In the worst case, I suppose that I have to first compute the expression above and then only slice the array in order to select the ""diagonals"" where $(m,n)=(l,o)$.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"

Attempted solution: Let $f:G\mapsto\hat{G}$ be a group homomorphism such that $\mbox{Ker}f \subseteq H$ we will try to show that $[G:H]=[f(G):f(H)]$.
Define a map $\phi: xH\mapsto f(x)f(H)$.
Function $\phi$ is injective as $f(x)f(H)=f(y)f(H)\Rightarrow f^{-1}(y)f(x)f(H)=f(H) \Rightarrow f(y^{-1}x)=f(h_1)\Rightarrow f(y^{-1}xh_1^{-1})=1_{\hat{G}}$ for some $h_1 \in H$. Since $\mbox{Ker}f \subseteq H$ we have $y^{-1}xh_1^{-1}=h_2$ for $h_2 \in H$. Finally, $xh_1=yh_2$ and, hence, $xH=yH$. Also, $\phi$ is well defined since $xH=yH$ implies $f(xH)=f(yH)\Rightarrow f(x)f(H)=f(y)f(H)$. Surjectivity of $\phi$ is obvious. Since $\phi$ is a bijection, $[G:H]=[f(G):f(H)]$.

605654,Orthonormal Basis for Hilbert Spaces,"The following is the definition of orthonormal base that I am using: The notion of an orthonormal basis from linear algebra generalizes over to the case of Hilbert spaces. In a Hilbert space H, an orthonormal basis is a family $\{e_{k}\}_{k} ∈ B$ of elements of $H$ satisfying the conditions: Orthogonality: $\langle e_{k}, e_{j}\rangle = 0$ for all $k,j$ in $B$ with $k \neq j$.
Normalization: $||e_{k}|| = 1$ for all $k,j$ in $B$ with $k \neq j$.
Completeness: The linear span of the family $e_{k}$ with $k \in B$ is dense in $H$. A system of vectors satisfying the first two conditions basis is called an orthonormal system or an orthonormal set. Such a system is always linearly independent. Completeness of an orthonormal system of vectors of a Hilbert space can be equivalently restated as: if $\langle v, e_{k}\rangle = 0$ for all $k \in B$ and some $v \in H$ then $v = 0$. This is related to the fact that the only vector orthogonal to a dense linear subspace is the zero vector, for if $S$ is any orthonormal set and $v$ is orthogonal to $S$, then $v$ is orthogonal to the closure of the linear span of $S$, which is the whole space. In the infinite-dimensional case, an orthonormal basis will not be a basis in the sense of linear algebra; to distinguish the two, the latter basis is also called a Hamel basis. That the span of the basis vectors is dense implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series, and the orthogonality implies that this decomposition is unique. Questions: 1.How does it follow ""$v$ is orthogonal to the closure of the linear span of $S$"" in the explanation of the restated definition of completeness? 2.In the last paragraph it states that ""The span of the basis vectors is dense in $H$ implies that every vector in the space can be written as the sum of an infinite series.

I did find this older post ( $x^y = y^x$ for integers $x$ and $y$ ) which included an answer by ""Yuval Filmus"" which states $y=x=0$ is $\it{trivially}$ a solution.  He accomplished this by defining $0^0$ to some value and moves on.  I would like to see something more rigorous, if it exists. Any hints on how to proceed? Edited for wording. Edit:  Stefan Smith confirms my suspicion that the comment of Yuval Filmus cannot be made rigorous.",['algebra-precalculus']

If $a^3 ≡b^3$(mod n) then $a ≡ b$ (mod n) How do I do this? For the record, I do not think this is True.","['modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"
