1639524,Why was the zeta function introduced?,"I know the 'Zeta Function' is very useful in Mathematics, and that it has relations with many other functions (such as the 'Gamma Function' ). I also know the 'Zeta Function' $\zeta(s)$ is defined as: $$\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1\over {n^s}}$$ But my question is why and how was this even derived? I've studied and understood many proofs regarding $\zeta(s)$, such as: $$\Gamma(s) \zeta(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} {{u^{s-1}\over {e^u}-1}} \space du$$ $$\zeta(s) = {2^s}{\pi^{s-1}}{sin \bigg({\pi s\over 2}\bigg)}{\Gamma(1-s)}{\zeta(1-s)}$$ But anytime I try search up information regarding the derivation of $\zeta(s)$, all I get is the fact that Leonhard Euler was amongst the first to study it.

1639595,How to calculate the derivative of logarithm of a matrix?,"Given a square matrix $M$, we know the exponential of $M$ is
$$\exp(M)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty{\frac{M^n}{n!}}$$ and the logarithm is $$\log(M)=-\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{(I-M)^k}{k}$$ The derivative of $\exp(M)$ should be itself. It is easy to prove if $\frac{dM}{M}=I$. But how to calculate the derivative of $\log(M)$? By the same way of calculation of the derivative of $\exp(M)$, the derivative of $\log(M)$ cannot converge.

1639767,About Factorization,"I have some issues understanding factorization. If I have the expression $x^{2}-x-7$ then (I was told like this) I can put this expression equal to zero and then find the solutions with the quadratic formula, so it gives me $x_{0,1}= 1 \pm 2\sqrt{2}$ then $$x^{2}-x-7 = (x-1-2\sqrt{2})(x-1+2\sqrt{2}).$$ That is correct I have checked it. Now for the expression $3x^{2}-x-2$ if I do the same I have $x_{0} = 1$ and $x_1=\frac{-2}{3}$ so I would have $$3x^{2}-x-2 = (x-1)(x+\frac{2}{3})$$
but this is not correct since  $(x-1)(x+\frac{2}{3}) = \frac{1}{3}(3x^{2}-x-2)$, the correct factorization is $3x^{2}-x-2 = (3x+2)(x-1)$. So I guess finding the roots of a quadratic expression is not sufficient for factorizing.",['algebra-precalculus']

1640075,Proof of the DKW inequality,"My goal is to prove the following inequality, known as the Dvoretsky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality (1956) : Let $(X_i)_{i \geqslant}$ be iid random variables. Let $\displaystyle F_n(x)= \frac{1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^n 1_{X_i \leqslant x}$ and $F$ the distribution function of $X_1$. Then there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for every $\varepsilon >0$ : $$\mathbb{P} \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)| > \varepsilon \right) \leqslant  C e^{-2n\varepsilon ^2}$$ I did not find any proof on the web (only the article of DKW of 1956 but it is not understandable to me due to their notations). The only thing I found was the proof that :  $$\mathbb{E} \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)| \right) \leqslant  \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}}$$ in this paper : https://www.math.ens.fr/enseignement/telecharger_fichier.php?fichier=474 (theorem 3.3) which is named the DKW inequality. I was not able to prove the DKW inquality from this result btu here is my try  : By the Markov inequality and for every function : $$\mathbb{P} \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)| > \varepsilon \right) \leqslant  \frac{\mathbb{E} \left( f \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)|\right) \right)}{f(\varepsilon)} $$. With $f(x)=e^{tx}$ and using the convexity of $f$ the Jensen inequality gives :
$$\mathbb{P} \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)| > \varepsilon \right) \leqslant  \frac{e^{ctn^{-1/2}}}{e^{t \varepsilon}} $$ But that does not give the correct result. Question. Does anyone can help me with proving the DKW inequality with the estimate  $\mathbb{E} \left( \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_n(x)-F(x)| \right) \leqslant  \frac{c}{\sqrt{n}}$ for start ?

1640092,Polynomial in the components of the curvature tensor,"Consider a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension n and let $K(t,x,y)$ be its heat kernel. Then it is known that the heat kernel has an asymptotic expansion as $t\downarrow 0$: $$K(t,x,x)\sim (4\pi t)^{-n/2}\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}u_k(x,x)t^k.$$ Often it is said that the functions $u_k(x.x)$ can be written as $O(n)-$invariant polynomials in the components of $R_x, (\nabla R)_x, (\nabla^2 R)_x,..., (\nabla^{2k-4} R)_x$ where $R$ denotes the Riemannian curvature tensor. The components of these polynomials do only depend on the dimension of $M$. I would really like to understand the above description for the functions $u_k(x,x)$ and need some help with it. My first naive interpretation would be the following: In order to evaluate $u_k(x,x)$, first choose an orthonormal basis $e_1,...,e_n$ of $T_xM$ and consider the 'components' of all the tensors above with respect to this orthonormal basis. The components would be: \begin{align}
R_x &: \lbrace g(R(e_i,e_j)e_k, e_m) \vert i,j,k,m=1,...,n\rbrace \\
 \nabla R_x&: \lbrace g(\nabla R(e_i,e_j,e_k,e_p), e_m)\vert i,j,k,m,p=1,...,n \rbrace ...\text{etc. up to $(\nabla^{4k-4}R)_x$}
\end{align} There exist a polynomial $P_k(x)$ (only depending on $k$), $x\in\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N=N(k)$ sufficiently large and $$p(x)=\sum_{\alpha\in \mathbb{N_0}^N} a_{\alpha}x^{\alpha} $$ such that: 1)  the coefficients $a_{\alpha}\in\mathbb{R}$ do only depend on the dimension $n$ (but not the particular manifold $M$) 2) If we replace formally the variables $x_1,...,x_N$ by all of the components above, we get the value $u_k(x,x)$ 3) The value of the polynomial does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis in $T_xM$. A different choice of orthonormal basis would obviously give rise to different components, but the values of the polynomial will not be effected by such a change of basis. (This would correspond to the $O(n)$-invariance of the polynomial) I am wondering if my interpretation is correct? Even if my suggestions are right, I am sure my interpretation is not the only possible or best one. So I would be glad if you could share your knowledge and can tell me different or better ways to handle this situation.

1640179,Trigonometric Equation Simplification,"$$3\sin x + 4\cos x = 2$$ To solve an equation like the one above, we were taught to use the double angle identity formula to get two equations in the form of $R\cos\alpha = y$ where $R$ is a coefficient and $\alpha$ is the second angle being added to $x$ when using the double angle identity. Why can't we use the identity $\sin(x) = \cos(x-90)$ to get $3\cos(x-90) + 4\cos x = 2$? Is this equation difficult to simplify further? Additionally, why was the relationship between $sinx$ and $cosx$ in the pythagorean theorem (modified for the unit circle) not put to use? I did the following: $$\sin^2x = 1 - \cos^2x$$ $$\therefore \sin x =  ¬±\sqrt{1-\cos^2x}$$ If: $$\sin x = y$$ Then, $$y = ¬±\sqrt{1-\cos^2x}$$ Meaning that, $$\cos x = ¬±\sqrt{1-y^2}$$ Inputting this into the original equation, $$3y + 4\sqrt{1-y^2} = 2$$ We see, $$3y-2=-4\sqrt{1-y^2}$$
So, $$(3y-2)^2=16-16y^2$$
Therefore, $$9y^2-12y+4=16-16y^2$$
Rearranging gives, $$25y^2-12y-12=0$$
And so the solutions are, $$y_0,y_1=\frac{12}{50}\pm\frac{1}{50}\sqrt{144+1200}$$
And simplifying yields, $$y_0,y_1=\frac{6\pm4\sqrt{21}}{25}$$

1640349,Number of $n$-digit permutations with exactly $n-2$ digits smaller than the next,"How many permutations of $1,2,\cdots, n$ contain exactly $n-2$ digits that are smaller than the digit immediately to their right? My solution proceeded with recursion. It has some chance of being wrong. We call all such permutations good permutations . We call a digit good if it is  are smaller than the next digit. Let $f(n)$ denote the number of good permutations of $1,2, \cdots ,n$. Note that a good permutation has exactly  $n-2$ digits. Consider any good permutation of $1,2,\cdots ,n+1$. Remove $1$ from the permutation. Note that this can decrease the number of good digits  by at most $1$. We have two cases : $1)$ Number of good digits remain the same: Since the original permutation was good, the new permutation has exactly $(n+1)-2=n-1$ good digits, but has only $n$ digits. But $n+1$ can never be a good digit, since it can never be smaller than any other digit. Hence, after removing $1$, each of $2,3,4, \cdots ,n$ is a good digit. But the only such permutation is $2$ $3$ $\cdots$ $n+1$. Now note that putting back $1$ does not increase or change the number of good digits (unless we put it at the start). Hence, there are exactly $n$ places where $1$ can go. $2)$ Number of good digits decreases: Since the number of good digits can decrease by at most $1$, in this case, the new permutation has exactly $n-2$ good digits. But there are exactly $f(n)$ of these permutations. When we put back $1$, we cannot place it in any of the following positions because then the number of good digits does not increase: A) After a good digit itself B) At the end There are exactly two places to put $1$ in then. So there are $2f(n)$ permutations in this case. Combining, we get, $f(n+1)=2f(n)+n$ Is this right? Thanks in advance","['combinatorics', 'contest-math']"

My question is closely related to this one, which was only asking for $\cos(ab)$. For instance $$\cos(x^2)= \frac{\cos^3(x)+\sin^3(x)}{2\cos^2(x)+2016}$$ could be such a formula. More precisely, I would like to know if the function $f : x \mapsto \cos(x^2)$ belongs to $F = \Bbb R(\cos, \sin)$. Here, the space $F$ denotes all the rational functions of the form $$x \mapsto \frac{P(\cos(x), \sin(x))}{Q(\cos(x), \sin(x))}$$ where $P, Q \in \Bbb R[X,Y]$ and $Q(\cos(x), \sin(x))‚â†0$ for all real numbers $x$.
(Notice that $x \mapsto \cos(nx)$ belongs to $F$ (if $n‚â•1$). It can be proved by induction on $n$.) My guess is no and here is why : thanks to partial fraction decomposition , every rational function has a primitive. Doing some tangent half-angle substitutions , one can see that every $g \in F$ has an explicit primitive (if I'm not mistaken). But my function $f : x \mapsto \cos(x^2)$ above has no elementary primitive. I think this can be shown thanks to Liouville's theorem . Does my reasoning is correct ?

1640496,"Proof that the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is a smooth manifold","This is my definition of a smooth manifold I am supposed to work with: Let $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$. The set $\mathcal{M}$ is a $k$-dimensional smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ if: $\mathcal{M}$ is given locally as the zero set of a function $F\colon W \to \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$, where $W \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $F$ is of class $C^{\infty}$, and so that $\mathcal{M} \cap W = \{\, x \in W \mid F(x)=0\, \}$. My definition also requires that the Jacobian $\mathcal{J}_{F}(x)$ has rank $n-k$ for every point $x \in \mathcal{M} \cap W$. $\ $ The special linear group is the set $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R}) = \{\, A \in M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \mid \det(A)=1\, \}$. I am trying to prove that this set is a smooth submanifold. From my reading online, I have understood that this submanifold has dimension $n^2-1$. I'm going to make the identification $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}\cong M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})$. My thoughts on proving this are to define a function $G\colon M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $G(A)=\det(A)-1$. We have obviously $M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \cap \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R}) = \mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ where $M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is open, and we know that $G$ is smooth since $\det$ is smooth. Furthermore, $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{R}) = \{\, A \in M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \mid G(A)=0\, \}$. Finally, the Jacobian of the function $\mathcal{J}_{G}$ is going to be a column vector of length $n^2$, and I will need to show that it has rank $1$. But since its a column vector, isn't this an immeadiate conclusion? So to me it seems like this proof is finished. However, it seems a little too easy.

1640731,"How do find the numerical average of $x^x$ from $(-4,-2)$ without x-values that give a complex output?","I wanted to find the approximate average of all real points in $(x)^{x}$ from $[-4,-2]$. This means I am ignoring all real inputs that give a complex output and need average to be a real number. To first solve this I found the following defined sets of $x^x$ when $x<0$.
$$x=-\frac{2m}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ $$x=-\frac{2m+1}{2k+1}|m,k\in\mathbb{Z}$$ Each of the sets coincides with another equation so I got the following peice-wise definition.
$$x^x=\begin{cases} (-x)^x & x=\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\\ -\left(-x\right)^{x} & x=\left\{ -{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\}\ \\ \text{undefined} & x\neq\left\{ -{2m\over 2k+1}\bigcup-{2m+1\over 2k+1}\ |\ m, k \in \Bbb Z\right\} \end{cases} $$ Then I took the limit definition of an integral along with $\frac{1}{b-a}$ to determine the average.
$$\frac{1}{b-a}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(a+\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{b-a}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)$$ where $f(x)=x^x$ (Note that it is possible to skip $x$-values that given an undefined output in an interval. An example is $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$) When $n\in\left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ there are numbers whose outputs coincide with $(-x)^{x}$ and numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$. So I took the probabilty of having numbers whose ouputs coincide with ($(-x)^x$ vs a numbers whose outputs coincide with $-(-x)^{x}$ in $[-4,-2]$. I got $\frac{1}{2}$ for both of them. Thus I found when $n \in \left\{\left.{4n+2}\right| n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ as $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{(-2)-(-4)}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{(-x)}^{x}+\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}-{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\right)=0$$ But when $n$ is odd, all numbers in the interval have outputs coinciding only with $(-x)^{x}$. So when $n$ is odd integer and $n\to\infty$ $$\frac{1}{-2+4}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{f\left(-4+\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)i\right)}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-4}^{-2}{\left(-x\right)}^{x}\approx.062152$$ I have two different numbers depending on which $n$value I choose. So does this mean the average does not exist? If not how could one find the average? What other methods can be used to find a real number average? EDIT Analyzing this I believe that one should choose specific $n's$ despite a limit having to accept all $n's$ I presume that an interval of reimmmen sum interval should be as dense as possible and represent all defined numbers. This leads me to believe the average is 0. Since this goes against the definition of a limit, I think the definition of a reimmen sum should be slightly altered for dense defined inputs with undefined outputs. For example I believe intervals with numerator increase of $1$ in $\{-12/3,-11/3,-10/3,-9/3,-8/3,-7/3,-6/3\}$ can would give an accurate average compared to an numerator increase of $2$ in $\{-12/3,-10/3,-8/3,-6/3\}$. When there is numerator increase of $1$ I end up with zero. Since it represents inputs whose output coincide with both $(-x)^x$ and $-(-x)^{x}$ the average should be zero. Perhaps my reasoning is correct but I would like to find out if this is the case.","['complex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'recreational-mathematics']"

using trapezoidal rule, namely:
$$
y_{n+1}=y_{n} + \frac{h}{2} \left( f(t_{n},y_{n}) + f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) \right)
$$
we get LTE (local truncation error) proportional to $C h^{3}$, $C=const$. Let's denote LTE in $n+1$-th step as:
$$
e_{n+1}= \phi(t_{n+1}) - y_{n+1}
$$
where $\phi(t_{n})$ represents the actual solution of our problem at $t=t_{n}$ and we assume that at the $n$-th step our approximating solution is exact with the real one ($\phi(t_{n}) = y_{n}$). I know that the most common method starts at representing $\phi(t)$ as the Taylor series about $t_{n+1}=t_{n}+h$ and using the fact that $\phi'(t_{n}) = f(t_{n},\phi(t_{n}))$. In this particular example I used two Taylor representations: $\phi(t_{n+1})=\phi(t_{n}+h)$ and $\phi(t_{n+1}-h)=\phi(t_{n})$. Combining them resulted in the formula:
$$
\phi(t_{n+1})=\phi(t_{n}) + \frac{h}{2}(\phi'(t_{n})+\phi'(t_{n+1})) + \frac{h^{2}}{4}(\phi''(t_{n})-\phi''(t_{n+1})) + \frac{h^{3}}{12}(\phi'''(\xi_{n})+\phi'''(\eta_{n+1}))
$$
where:
$$
t_{n}<\xi_{n}<t_{n}+h
$$
$$
t_{n}<\eta_{n+1}<t_{n}+h
$$
So plugging this obtained formula for $\phi(t_{n+1})$ into the equation 
$$
e_{n+1} = \phi(t_{n+1}) - y_{n+1} = \phi(t_{n+1}) -y_{n} - \frac{h}{2} \left( f(t_{n},y_{n}) + f(t_{n+1},y_{n+1}) \right)
$$
and assuming that $\phi(t_{n})=y_{n}$ resulted in:
$$
e_{n+1} = \frac{h^{2}}{4}(\phi''(t_{n})-\phi''(t_{n+1})) + \frac{h^{3}}{12}(\phi'''(\xi_{n})+\phi'''(\eta_{n+1}))
$$
So it would be $e_{n+1}=O(h^{2})$, not $O(h^{3})$ (and we know that it is $O(h^{3})$). I saw in the literature that assuming correctness of approximation at $t_{n}$ means that trapezoidal rule can be represented as:
$$
y_{n+1} = y_{n} + \frac{h}{2} \left( f(t_{n},\phi(t_{n})) + f(t_{n+1},\phi(t_{n+1})) \right)
$$
but it doesn't make sense to me because of the correctness of the term $\phi(t_{n+1})$. I hope that I presented my problem clearly, thanks in advance for any help  with solving it!","['numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1641094,Raising e to the power of both sides of an equation,"I have a simple question: in differential equations, it has been common in several of my homework problems to raise a base $e$ to the power of both sides of an equation to get variables out of natural log functions. My question is what happens if you have a zero term? For example: $$
ln(x) + ln(y) = z
$$
is equivalent to
$$
e^{ln(x)} + e^{ln(y)} = e^z
$$ which simplifies to
$$
x + y = e^z
$$ But what happens if $y=1$? $$
ln(x) + ln(1) = z
$$
$$
ln(x) + 0 = z
$$ At this point, if you removed zero from the equation and then raised both sides by $e$, you would get $x = e^z$ when it should be $x + 1 = e^z$. Thinking about it in this manner, one could claim the following: $$
1 + 0 = 1
$$
$$
e^1 + e^0 = e^1
$$
$$
e + 1 = e
$$
$$
1 = 0
$$
Is there some rule that explains why this algebra breaks down, and when it is wrong to raise both sides of an equation by $e$?

1641110,Proof that the Rubik‚Äôs Cube group is 2-generated,"Singmaster (1981) writes, on page 32 of his Notes on Rubik‚Äôs Magic Cube : Frank Barnes observes that the group of the cube is generated by two moves:

\beta &= UFRUR^{-1}U^{-1}F^{-1} &=(UF,UL)_+(UR)_+(UBR,UFL)_-(URF)_+
\end{align*}
  Observe that $\alpha^7$ is an $11$-cycle of edges and $\alpha^{11}$ is a $7$-cycle of corners, that $\beta$ affects the edge and corner left fixed by $\alpha$, and that $$\beta^2 = (UF)_+(UL)_+(UBR)_-(UFL)_-(UFR)_-$$ [...] The remaining details are left as an exercise. I hadn't seen this notation before, so I'll explain it here. Notation like $(LU, BD, DF)$ means an edge cycle , in which: The $L$-$U$ edge moves to the $B$-$D$ edge's place, with the $L$ half ending up on the $B$ face, and the $U$ half ending up on the $D$ face. Similarly $BD \to DF$ and $DF \to LU$. The notation for corners is similar. Notation like $(UF, UL)_+$ is a twisted cycle : again, $UF \to UL$, but now $UL \to FU$; the final edge gets flipped when cycling back to the first edge. For corners, the notation is similar, but corners rotate , they don't flip. A subscript $+$ means clockwise rotation, a subscript $-$ means counterclockwise rotation. $(UR)_+$ means a single edge is flipped. $(UBR)_-$ means a single corner is rotated counterclockwise. I would like to show that this is indeed true, by writing each element in $\{F,B,L,R,U,D\}$ as a product of elements in $\{\alpha, \beta, \alpha^{-1}, \beta^{-1}\}$ ‚Äì preferably, having those product be as short as possible.

An earlier video in lecture series proved these properties: If $u(x,t)$ is a solution to $I)$ then for each fixed $y$, the translate
  $u(x-y,t)$ is also a solution. If $u$ is a solution then every derivative of $u$ is also a solution. Every linear combination of solutions is also a solution. If $S(x,t)$ is a solution then so is its integral. Thus $S(x-y,t)$ is a
  solution and so is $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S(x-y,t)g(y)dy$ for each

1641264,Concavity of the $n$th root of the volume of $r$-neighborhoods of a set,"Let $A$ be a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For $r>0$, let $A_r$ be the $r$-neighborhood of $A$, namely the set $\{x:\operatorname{dist}(x,A)\le r\}$. Is the function $f(r) = \mu(A_r)^{1/n}$ concave? ($\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure.) Context This came up in the discussion of George Lowther's answer , where I asserted that the concavity of $f$ follows from the Brunn-Minkowski inequality . As George Lowther pointed out, this approach seems to require $A$ to be convex. Here's a proof for convex $A$. Since $A$ is convex, we have $A=\frac12(A+A)$, using Minkowski/vector addition. Let $B$ be the closed unit ball (also convex). For $r,s>0$ we have 
$$
A+\frac{r+s}{2}B = \frac12 (A+A)+\frac r2 B + \frac s2 B = \frac12(A+rB)+\frac12(A+sB)
$$
Taking the $n$th root of volume on both sides and using the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, we obtain
$$
f((r+s)/2) = \mu\left(\frac12(A+rB)+\frac12(A+sB)\right)^{1/n} \ge 
\frac12 \mu(A+rB)^{1/n}+\frac12 \mu(A+sB)^{1/n}
$$
proving that $f$ is midpoint-concave. Since it's also monotone, it is concave. The proof falls apart when $A$ is not convex, since the inclusion $A\subset \frac12(A+A)$ goes the wrong way. But I don't see a counterexample.","['volume', 'measure-theory', 'convex-analysis']"
1641268,Uniqueness of Smith normal form in Z (ring of integers),"It is a very well known fact that Smith Normal Form has proven useful when dealing with the development of the structure theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. In this context, there is an approach that takes advantage of the next result, which indeed is a very particular case of a much more general theorem related with a special kind of rings. If $A$ is a $m\times n$ matrix with integer coefficients, then there exist two matrices $P$ of size $m\times m$ and $Q$ of size $n\times n$, both having integer entries and $\det =\pm 1$, such that $PAQ$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_k$ ($k<\min(m,n)$) such that $d_1\mid d_2\mid \ldots\mid d_k$, and each $d_i$ is a positive integer.
Furthermore, $d_1\mid \ldots\mid d_k$ are unique. I have no problem with the proof of the ""existence"" part of the last theorem. However, I can't manage to give a proof of the ""uniqueness"" part; at most, I can only show that if $d'_1\mid\ldots\mid d'_{\ell}$ have the same property, then $d'_1 = d_1$ (they are both the gcd of the entries of $A$).

I can't find any solutions to $\text{gpf}(p^4+1) \le p$ for prime $p \le 10000$, where $\text{gpf}$ is the greatest prime factor, but there are plenty for $\text{gpf}(p^3+1) \le p$, for example $\text{gpf}(2971^3+1) = 743 \lt 2971$.

I'm interested in ways to intuitively understand this fact. Most of what I know on this topic comes from this wonderful blog , which gives a proof [*] of the above at the link. He points out that every child uniquely defines a parent, and that every parent has a either a smaller numerator or a smaller denominator than its child. Therefore, if you start from any fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ in lowest terms, you can always trace a path back to $\frac{1}{1}$, the root. This is a really nice proof, but it feels a bit ""backwards"" to me, in that we visualize walking the tree from the bottom up. Does anyone know of alternate proofs of this fact? I don't need rigor, just intuition. Thoughts: Clearly, all children must have either a greater numerator or a greater denominator than any of their ancestors, so they can't be repeats of an ancestor. (We also need ""lowest terms"" for this, but that follows by a separate argument -- see footnote). So I'm only worried about ""cousins"". Perhaps there is some property that all the left children of a node share, which the right children do not?

1641414,Theorem 2.43 in Baby Rudin: How to understand the proof?,"Here's Theorem 2.43 in the book Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, 3rd edition: Let $P$ be a non-empty perfect set in $\mathbb{R}^k$ . Then $P$ is uncountable. Here's the definition of a perfect set: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, and let $P \subset X$ . Then $P$ is perfect if it is closed (i.e. it contains all of its limit points) and every point of $P$ is also a limit point of $P$ . Now here's the proof Rudin gives: Since $P$ has limit points, $P$ must be infinite. Suppose $P$ is countable, and denote the points of $P$ by $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$ . We shall construct a sequence $\{V_n\}$ of neighborhoods as follows: Let $V_1$ be any neighborhood of $x_1$ . If $V_1$ consists of all $y \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $\vert y - x_1 \vert < r$ , the closure $\overline{V_1}$ of $V_1$ is the set of all $y \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $\vert y - x_1 \vert \leq r$ . Supose $V_n$ has been constructed, so that $V_n \cap P$ is not empty. Since every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$ , there is a neighborhood $V_{n+1}$ such that (i) $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , (ii) $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ , (iii) $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is not empty. By (iii), $V_{n+1}$ satisfies our induction hypothesis, and the construction can proceed. Put $K_n = \overline{V_n} \cap P$ . Since $\overline{V_n}$ is closed and bounded, $\overline{V_n}$ is compact. Since $x_n \not\in K_{n+1}$ , no point of $P$ lies in $\cap_1^\infty K_n$ . Since $K_n \subset P$ , this implies that $\cap_1^\infty K_n$ is empty. But each $K_n$ is non-empty, by (iii), and $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ , by (i); this contradicts the Corollary to Theorem 2.36. Finally, here's Theorem 2.36: If $\{K_\alpha\}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space $X$ such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of $\{K_\alpha\}$ is nonempty, then $\cap K_\alpha$ is nonempty. And, here's the Corollary to Theorem 2.36: If $\{K_n\}$ is a sequence of nonempty compact sets such that $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ ( $n=1, 2, 3, \ldots$ ), then $\cap_1^\infty K_n$ is not empty. Now my question is, what exactly is the induction hypothesis that Rudin refers to in the proof? For $V_1$ , he only says that it is any neighborhood of the point $x_1$ . What is the induction hypothesis? Please also proceed from $V_1$ to $V_2$ , and then from $V_2$ to $V_3$ for the sake of illustration. After reading David's comment, I've modified my proof as follows: Since $P$ is nonempty, it has a point $a$ , which is also a limit point of $P$ since $P$ is perfect. But no finite set in a metric space can have a limit point. So $P$ must be infinite. Suppose that $P$ is countable, and let's denote the points of $P$ by $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots$ . We shall construct a sequence $V_n$ of neighborhoods such that, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the intersection $V_n \cap P$ is non-empty and $x_n \not\in V_{n+1}$ . Let $V_1$ be any neighborhood of $x_1$ . Then we can show that if $$V_1  = \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - x_1 \vert < \epsilon_1 \ \right\},$$ where $\epsilon_1$ is some positive real number, then the closure $\overline{V_1}$ of $V_1$ is given by $$ \overline{V_1} = \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - x_1 \vert  \leq \epsilon_1 \ \right\}.$$ Since $x_1$ is a limit point of set $P$ , the nieghborhood $V_1$ of $x_1$ contains a point, say, $y_1$ of $P$ other than the point $x_1$ itself. Now $y_1 \in V_1$ and $V_1$ is an open set in the metric space $\mathbb{R}^k$ . So there is a positive real number $\delta_1$ such that $N_{\delta_1} (y_1) \subset V_1$ , where $$N_{\delta_1} (y_1)  \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_1 \vert  < \delta_1 \ \right\}.$$ Let $$\epsilon_2 \colon= \frac 1 2 \min \left( \delta_1, \vert x_1 - y_1 \vert \right).$$ Then $\epsilon_2 > 0$ .
  Let $$V_2 \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_1 \vert  < \epsilon_2 \ \right\}.$$ Then $$\overline{V_2} = \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_1 \vert  \leq  \epsilon_2 \ \right\}.$$ Thus, $V_2$ is a neighborhood such that $ y_1 \in V_2 \cap P$ so that $V_2 \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_2} \subset V_1$ , but $x_1 \not\in \overline{V_2}$ . If $ y_1  \not= x_2$ ,  then let $$\epsilon_3 \colon= \frac 1 2 \min \left( \epsilon_2 , \vert p - x_2 \vert \right).$$ Then $\epsilon_3 > 0$ .
  Let $$V_3 \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_1 \vert < \epsilon_3 \ \right\}.$$ Then $$\overline{V_3} = \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_1 \vert \leq  \epsilon_3 \ \right\}.$$ Thus, $y_1 \in V_3 \cap P$ , and so $V_3 \cap P$ is non-empty; moreover, $\overline{V_3} \subset V_2$ and $x_2 \not\in \overline{V_3}$ . On the other hand, if $y_1 = x_2$ , then since $y_1$ is a limit point of set $P$ , and $V_2$ is a neighborhood of $y_1$ , this neighborhood $V_2$ contains a point $y_2$ , say, of $P$ other than the point $y_1 = x_2$ itself. Now as $y_2 \in V_2$ and $V_2$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^k$ , so there is some positive real number $\delta_2  > 0$ such that $$N_{\delta_2 } (y_2) \subset V_2.$$ So if we take $$\epsilon_3 \colon= \frac 1 2 \min \left( \delta_2 - \vert y_2 - x_2 \vert , \  \vert y_2 - x_2 \vert \right),$$ then $\epsilon_3 > 0$ . Let $$V_3 \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_2 \vert < \epsilon_3 \ \right\}.$$ Then $$\overline{V_3} \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - y_2 \vert \leq  \epsilon_3 \ \right\}.$$ Thus, $y_2 \in V_3 \cap P$ and so $V_3 \cap P$ is non-empty; moreover, $\overline{V_3} \subset V_2$ , and $x_2 \not\in V_3$ . Thus, in either case we have obtained a neighborhood $V_3$ such that $V_3 \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_3} \subset V_2$ , but $x_2 \not\in V_3$ . The step from $V_2$ to $V_3$ is redundant in the formal  presentation of the proof, but this step perhaps more vividly illustrates how to proceed. Now suppose that a neighborhood $V_n$ ( $n= 3, 4, 5, \ldots$ ) has been constructed such that $x_{n-1} \not\in \overline{V_n}$ , $\overline{V_n} \subset V_{n-1}$ , and $V_n \cap P$ is non-empty.
  Let $$V_n \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - p \vert < \epsilon  \ \right\},$$ where $\epsilon$ is some positive real number and $p$ is some point in $\mathbb{R}^k$ . We now construct $V_{n+1}$ such that $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , and $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ . Suppose that $q \in V_n \cap P$ . As $q \in V_n$ and $V_n$ is open, there is some positive real number $\delta_n$ such that $$N_{\delta_n} (q) \subset V_n,$$ where $$N_{\delta_n} (q) \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - q \vert < \delta_n \ \right\}.$$ If $q \not= x_n$ , then let's take $$\epsilon_{n+1} \colon= \frac 1 2 \min \left( \delta_n , \vert q - x_n \vert \right).$$ So $\epsilon_{n+1} > 0$ , and let $$V_{n+1} \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - q \vert < \epsilon_{n+1} \ \right\}.$$ Then $$\overline{V_{n+1}} \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - q \vert \leq  \epsilon_{n+1} \ \right\}.$$ Thus, $V_{n+1}$ is a neighborhood such that $q \in V_{n+1} \cap P$ so that $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , and $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ . On the contrary, if $q = x_n$ , then since $q$ is a limit point of $P$ , the neighborhood $N_{\delta_n} (q)$ contains a point $b$ , say, of $P$ other than the point $q = x_n$ itself. Now if we take $$\epsilon_{n+1} \colon= \frac 1 2 \min \left( \delta_n - \vert b - x_n \vert, \  \vert b - x_n \vert \right),$$ then $\epsilon_{n+1} > 0$ . Let $$V_{n+1} \colon= \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - b \vert < \epsilon_{n+1} \ \right\}.$$ Then $$\overline{V_{n+1}} = \left\{ \ y \in \mathbb{R}^k \ \colon \ \vert y - b \vert = \epsilon_{n+1} \ \right\}.$$ So, $b \in V_{n+1} \cap P$ , which implies that $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , and $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ . Thus, from $V_n$ , in either case, we have constructed  a neighborhood $V_{n+1}$ such that $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , but $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ . Thus, we have inductively obtained a sequence $\{V_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of neighborhoods such that, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ , the intersection $V_n \cap P$ is non-empty, $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , and $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ . Put $K_n \colon= \overline{V_n} \cap P$ for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be arbitrary. Now $\overline{V_n}$ , being a closed and bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ , is compact. Moreover, as both $P$ and $\overline{V_n}$ are closed, so is $K_n$ . Thus, $K_n$ , being a closed subset of the compact set $\overline{V_n}$ , is also compact. Since $V_n \cap P$ is non-empty, so $K_n$ is also non-empty. Moreover, as $$\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n \subset \overline{V_n},$$ so we have $K_{n+1} \subset K_n$ . Finally, as $$P = \left\{ \ x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots \ \right\}$$ and as $x_n \not\in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ , so $x_n \not\in K_{n+1}$ and hence $$x_n \not\in  K_1 \cap K_2 \cap K_3 \cap \ldots,$$ which implies that this intersection is empty. Let $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_r \in \mathbb{N}$ , and let's take $$m \colon= \max \left( m_1, \ldots, m_r \right).$$ Then $$K_{m_1} \cap \ldots \cap K_{m_r} = K_m,$$ which is non-empty. Thus, $\{K_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence of non-empty compact sets in the metric space $\mathbb{R}^k$ such that the intersection of any finitely many of these sets is non-empty but the intersection $\cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} K_n$ is empty. But this cannot hold in any metric space, by Theorem 2.36 in Rudin. So our suppose that $P$ is a non-empty perfect set in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and $P$ is also countable is wrong. Hence Theorem 2.43 in Rudin holds. Is the above proof correct? If so, is the presentation clear enough (or any clearer than Rudin's presentation)? Where does this proof need improvement?","['real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Then, the reflection principle states that for all $a > 0$, $$P(\max_{1\leq k\leq n} S_k \geq a) = P(S_n \geq a) + P(S_n \geq a + 1).$$ I have looked at many places but I have rarely found a full proof for the simple random walk case (I have found lots of document that state it for stochastic process / brownian motion, etc. ). So just to be sure to understand, I wrote the following proof. Is it correct? Proof : We have, for $a \in \mathbb N$, \begin{align*}P\Big(\max_{k\leq n} S_k \geq a\Big) &= \sum_{k=-n}^n P(\max_{k\leq n} S_k \geq a \cap S_n = k)

\\ &= \sum_{k=-n}^{a - 1}  P(\max_{k\leq n} S_k \geq a \cap S_n = 2 a - k) + \sum_{k=a}^n P(\max_{1\leq k\leq n} S_k \geq a \cap S_n = k)
\\ &= \sum_{k=-n}^{a - 1}  P(S_n = 2 a - k) + \sum_{k=a}^n P(S_n = k)
\\ &= \sum_{j=a+1}^{2 a + n}  P(S_n = j) + \sum_{k=a}^n P(S_n = k) = P(S_n \geq a + 1) + P(S_n \geq a).
\end{align*} When $a$ is not an integer, the same argument works by replacing $a$ by $\lceil a \rceil$, and we can verify that the equality $P(\max_{1\leq k\leq n} S_k \geq a) = P(S_n \geq a) + P(S_n \geq a + 1)$ still holds.","['random-walk', 'probability-theory', 'random-variables']"

Since the law of the log of the order of a permutation converges to a normal law (for instance Erd√∂s-Turan Statistical group theory III), one expects that the probability for two permutations of $S_n$ to have the same order goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. Indeed experimentally this seems to happen with speed $O(1/n^2)$ I know that Wilf proved an asymptotic for a permutation in $S_n$ to be of order $d$ ( https://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/website/Asymptotics%20of%20exp%28P%28z%29%29.pdf ) but I don't think it can be used directly.

I have to say it's not easy to grasp the concepts without a practical example, so I'm trying to understand topology in a practical (psychologically applicable) way. I was thinking for example about the concept of something being inside of another thing , like someone being inside a house, tea being inside a cup or a smaller circle lying inside a bigger one asf. Humans can identify those things as being the same (belonging to one equivalence class?), i.e. if I ask someone to identify the object inside the other one, every normal functioning person will be able to identify the object inside, no matter how different the properties (color, size, form asf.) of the objects are. So there must be some general properties the brain uses. But how can I define this concept of being inside another thing topologically/mathematically so that it is applicable for a wide range of objects? And what if it gets even more complex. What if a time factor is included like putting something inside another thing . For example putting a key inside a keyhole, putting a steak in the frying pan, putting food into a shopping bag  asf. So here it's about a processes over time which should belong to the same equivalence class. How can this be defined? I hope it became clear what I mean and I'm looking for some inspirational thoughts.

1641851,Proving that the exponential inequality $e^x \ge x^e$ holds for all $x \ge 0$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Why $e^x$ is always greater than $x^e$? (8 answers) Closed 8 years ago . How does one prove that $$e^x \ge x^e$$ for all $x \ge 0$? I tried to do this by setting $f(x)=e^x-x^e$ Plotting this function shows this easily, as seen here . However, when I tried to prove this, it proved quite difficult. It seems to be increasing for $0 \le x \le e$, and seems to be increasing for all $x \ge e$. I tried to use that $f'(x)=e^x-ex^{e-1}$ but was not able to. Any help would be appreciated.","['derivatives', 'inequality', 'exponential-function', 'calculus']"

1641953,Russell's paradox question,"Tao's analysis book uses following example for Russell's paradox:
$$P(x) \Longrightarrow `` x\text{ is a set, and }x \notin  x""\\
\Omega := \{x : P(x)\text{ is true} \} = \{x : x\text{ is a set and }x \notin x\}$$
then conclude that $¬≠\Omega \in \Omega$ and $¬≠\Omega \notin \Omega$ happened same time. so it is a paradox. 
My question is if $x$ is a set, you can't write $x \notin  x$ right? only element belong to a set, isn't the statement wrong at the first place? or this could not be called as a statement.","['paradoxes', 'real-analysis', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1641960,Proving that a function grows faster than another,"I'm told to prove or disprove that $4^{\sqrt{n}}$ grows faster than $\sqrt{4^n}$
As n tends to infinity. From my Previous years Calculus I know that if I take the derivative of two functions, and one is bigger, than it must grow faster. $f(n) = 4^{\sqrt{n}}$ $g(n) = \sqrt{4^n}$ if
$f'(n)$ is > $g'(n)$ Then $f(n)$ grows faster than $g(n)$, as $n\to\infty$ My Attempt: $f'(n) = (\ln(4)\times 4^{\sqrt n)})
 /2^{\sqrt n}$ $g'(n) = (\ln(4)\times 4^{n/2})
             /2$ But Now I'm not sure if f(n) does grow faster, how would I know that it's first derivative is bigger here, just by plugging in numbers?","['functional-analysis', 'discrete-mathematics', 'calculus', 'limits']"
