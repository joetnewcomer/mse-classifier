2116934,"What counts as a ""known"" function","This question arises from a discussion on How to deal with the integral of $e^x e^{x^2}$? where the error function is invoked and there is a comment that this might not be a satisfactory solution (at least for some) because it is more a renaming exercise than a solution. Similarly for the Lambert W, which appears regularly. Now there are functions we all know and learn, like the trigonometric functions, exponential function and logarithm, which emerge reasonably naturally in various contexts early in our mathematical experience. Hyperbolic functions (sinh/cosh etc) are not so immediately used, but emerge through being the odd and even parts of the exponential function as well as in other ways. Then there are special functions of various kinds like Bessel Functions, Legendre Polynomials, Hypergeometric functions as well as those in the presenting discussion. It seems to me that whether we actually like particular functions or not - or consider them as solutions rather than renamings - might depend on the fluency and intuition we have developed in understanding them. It seems to me to be a bit like solving equations by radicals, which is a nice thing to do, because we know what radicals are - but practically we return to numerical estimates very often, so the radical gives an illusion of precision rather than a practical solution. So my question is approximately ""what makes a function familiar enough to be a special function?"" Now this could be too vague, or opinion-based, or more suitable for meta - but on the other hand I thought the discussion was interesting enough to highlight, and maybe others will have some useful insight.","['special-functions', 'soft-question', 'functions']"

2116999,Euler Limit of $\frac{x^x-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}$ Without L'Hopital,"On slide $10$ here: http://math.cmu.edu/~bwsulliv/basel-problem.pdf , it is stated that Euler may have used L'Hopital's Rule to show that the limit $$\lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^x-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}=-2$$
I was able to reproduce this easily with L'Hopital's Rule Upon two applications of it (shown at the bottom of this post). I've attempted and failed showing this limit using various methods including substitutions, Squeeze Theorem, splitting it up into $\dfrac{x^x}{1-x+\ln(x)}-\dfrac{x}{1-x+\ln(x)}$ (doesn't seem to work because it's just indeterminate), and series expansion representations (sort of). Substitutions tried and problems with them: Let $y=\ln(x)\implies x=e^y$ and $x^x=e^{ye^y}$, but I still get
$\frac{0}{0}$ and couldn't find a way to transform it into a known
limit. Let $y=x^x\implies \ln(y)=x\ln(x)$, but don't know how to solve for $x$ here in terms of $y$. Let $y=e^x\implies \ln(y)=x\implies x^x=(\ln(y))^{(\ln(y))}$. This limit did not seem to be easier. For Squeeze Theorem, I simply couldn't find suitable comparisons mostly since I could not remove the $\ln(x)$ in those comparisons. Even removing the $x^x$ doesn't seem like it would help since $\dfrac{x^x-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}$ is strictly less than $\dfrac{-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}$. So, even if the new limit went to $-2$, which it doesn't, we wouldn't have strictly shown the original limit to be $-2$. As for series expansions, I have no idea how to get a good series expansion of that (tried Taylor at $x=0,1,2$, but very messy and still gave $\frac{0}{0}$ and didn't give any hints). With L'Hopital $$\lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^x-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}\to\dfrac{0}{0}\implies \lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^x-x}{1-x+\ln(x)}=\lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^x(\ln(x)+1)-1}{-1+\frac{1}{x}}=\dfrac{0}{0}$$ $$\implies \lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^x(\ln(x)+1)-1}{-1+\frac{1}{x}}=\lim_{x\to 1}\dfrac{x^{x-1}+x^x(\ln(x)+1)\ln(x)+x^x(\ln(x)+1)}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}$$ $$=-(1^2)\cdot\left[1^{1-1}+1^1(\ln(1)+1)\ln(1)+1^1(\ln(1)+1)\right]=(-1)\cdot\left[1+0+1\right]=\boxed{-2}$$ I appreciate any helps or hints on changing this does to a bunch of known/simpler limits.","['limits-without-lhopital', 'limits']"

On a coordinate plane, the lines would be equivalent to starting at $y=9$ on the $y$ axis and ending at $x=1$ on the $x$ axis.  With each line, I would decrease the $y$ by one unit and increase the $x$ by one unit.

2117058,Is this hierarchy of manifolds correct?,"Question: a Hausdorff differentiable manifold (locally Euclidean space): $$ \text{is metrizable} \iff \text{is paracompact} \iff \text{admits a Riemannian metric} \,?$$ Does one also have for a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space (not necessarily differentiable): $$\text{second countable} \iff \text{metrizable with countably many connected components}? $$ Thus second countability is strictly stronger for such spaces than metrizability/paracompactness/existence of a Riemannian metric? ( According to this question , it seems they are all equivalent when connectedness is assumed, and according to this question even equivalent to the existence of a universal cover when connected.) Attempt: By the Smirnov metrization theorem , a locally metrizable space (e.g. locally Euclidean spaces) are metrizable if and only if they are Hausdorff and paracompact. According to Wikipedia, Riemannian manifolds are metrizable . (Is this only true for connected Riemannian manifolds, or can we use the trick where we make the metric less than 1 on each connected component and 1 for distances between points in different components? Or perhaps only when there are at most countably many components?) Finally, according to Wikipedia , any differentiable paracompact manifold admits a Riemannian metric (I'm not sure if the differentiable hypothesis is necessary -- this question seems related ). Thus (at least for connected , differentiable Hausdorff manifolds) ""admits Riemannian metric"" $\implies$ ""metrizable"" $\implies$ paracompact $\implies$ ""admits Riemannian metric"". Context: This question is motivated by how the definition of manifold used by Spivak in Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry ( see here for a related question ) is different from the one used by Lee in Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (where second countability is required). In particular, I had thought that the definition my professor was using (Hausdorff, metrizable, locally Euclidean) was equivalent to Lee's, until Spivak started mentioning a bunch of counterexamples which I recognized as not being second countable. Although I don't remember if my professor specified countably many components, which would rule out most of Spivak's counterexamples consisting of uncountable spaces with the discrete topology and metric.","['differential-topology', 'proof-verification', 'manifolds', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"
2117059,Is it possible to take infinite derivates on a finite interval?,"This question comes from physics but I think it fits better here. On page 488 of Sakurai's Modern Quantum Mechanics he says that in order to find an infinite series of higher order derivatives of a function, i.e.
$$
i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t) = \left[m - \frac{1}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{8m^3}\frac{\partial^4}{\partial x^4}-\cdots\right]\psi(x,t),
$$ 
you would have to specify the function at ""farther and farther away from the origin"" (or whatever point you are evaluating at). The problem (in the physics context) is that this implies nonlocality. Ideally, you should be able to specify the time derivative and spacial derivatives at a point, solving the equation. However, I think Sakurai means to imply that knowing all derivatives at a point is equivalent to knowing the value of the function everywhere. My question is is it possible to take all derivatives $\frac{\partial^n}{\partial x^n}\psi$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ only knowing the value of the function on a finite interval? (thanks to Roland for the wording). If so, can't we do the same thing we do with the first derivative (making the interval smaller and smaller) in order to make the interval vanishingly small? Could we then recover locality?","['derivatives', 'quantum-mechanics']"

2117099,Calabi-Yau condition in darboux coordinates,"Definition: One definition of a Calabi-Yau manifold is that of a Kahler manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, with a non-vanishing holomorphic $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ satisfying 
$$
\omega^n/n! = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(i/2)^n \Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega},

where $\omega$ is the symplectic form on $X$. For any symplectic form we can take Darboux coordinates $(x,y)=(x_1,\dots,x_n, y_1,\dots,y_n)$ such that 
$$\omega = \sum_i dx_i \wedge dy_i.$$ (Note: In general these coordinates are not holomorphic, i.e. $z= x+iy$ are not complex coordinates.) Question: In these coordinates, does $\Omega$ look like $\Omega = dx_1 +idy_1 \wedge \dots \wedge dx_n +idy_n$? Thoughts : This seems like a lot to expect since the condition only requires the wedge product to be non-trivial as we are in the top degree and the coefficients can be adjusted. So I guess this must be a highly underdetermined equation. On the other hand, I don't see that it is has to be false. The Calab-Yau condition would definitely hold and it seems like it is true when $n=1$. In the $X=\mathbb C^n$ setting it is also true (however, in that case $(x,y)$ do induce complex coordinates). Another reason I'm thinking this might be true up to some function is that a Kahler manifold with SU$(n)$ holonomy admits such an $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ and it is unique up to change of phase (see Lemma 4.4) . So maybe it is not as underdetermined as it looks?","['riemannian-geometry', 'complex-geometry', 'symplectic-geometry', 'kahler-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
2117107,Spectrum of the derivative operator,"Let $X$ be the subspace of $L^2(\Bbb{R})$ which consists of continuously differentiable functions with derivatives in $L^2(\Bbb{R})$. Then it asks to perform spectral analysis on the differential operator $A=\frac{d}{dx}$, i.e. find the spectrum of $A$. The statement of the question itself is vague. From my understanding, I think the question means the following: we need to find the spectrum of the linear operator
$$A:X\to S,\quad Af=f',$$
where $S=C(\Bbb{R})\cap L^2(\Bbb{R})$, and both $X,S$ are endowed with the $L^2$ norm $\|\cdot\|_2$. About the definition of spectrum I have:
Let $T: V\to W$ be a bounded linear operator between two normed linear spaces, we say that $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ is in the point spectrum of $A$ if $\lambda I-A$ is not injective the residual spectrum of $A$ if $\lambda I-A$ is injective but the range of $\lambda I-A$ is not dense in $W$ the continuous spectrum if $\lambda I-A$ is injective and the range of $\lambda I-A$ is dense in $W$, but the inverse $(\lambda I-A)^{-1}$ defined on the range is unbounded. My attempt: First I found the point spectrum $\sigma_p(A)$. For any $\lambda\in\Bbb{C}$, let $f\in Ker(\lambda I-A)$. This implies that $\lambda f(t)-f'(t)=0$ for all $t\in\Bbb{R}$. Then we can see that $f(t)=ce^{\lambda t}$ for $c\in\Bbb{C}$. Since $f$ is square integrable on $\Bbb{R}$, this forces $c=0$. Hence we see that $f\equiv 0$ and therefore $\sigma_p(A)=\emptyset.$ Then I was trying to find the residual and continuous spectrums, and I got stuck at this point. Any help is greatly appreciated.","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'spectral-theory', 'operator-theory']"

However, this 'closed form' doesn't check out when I try implementing it in Mathematica. For a complete description see this paper , section 2.5. For more general information see this paper .

B = a_0 + b_0 - c_0 - d_0 \\
C = a_0 - b_0 + c_0 - d_0 \\
D = a_0 - b_0 - c_0 + d_0$$ (Note the problem - some of the numbers above can be negative).

2117178,On the integral $\int\sqrt{1+\cos x}\text{d} x$,"I've been wondering about the following integral recently:
$$
I = \int\sqrt{1+\cos x}\,\text{d}x
$$
The way I integrated it is I used the identity $\sqrt{1+\cos x} = \sqrt2\cos\frac x2$, and so
$$
I = 2\sqrt2\sin\frac x2 + C
$$ the problem is that $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ is actually integrable over the entire real line, but the derivative of $2\sqrt2\sin\frac x2$ is only equal to $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ in certain intervals. This is because the actual identity is $\sqrt{1+\cos x} = \sqrt2\left|\cos\frac x2\right|$. Now, I wasn't exactly sure how to integrate the absolute value, so I thought I would ""fix"" the function after integration. The first fix we can do is making sure that the sign of the result of integration is correct:
$$
I = 2\sqrt2\sin\frac x2\text{sgn}\cos\frac x2 + C
$$
The problem with just $\sin\frac x2$ was that sometimes it was ""flipped"", on certain intervals it was actually the antiderivative of the $-\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ (this is because we dropped the absolute value signs). There is one further problem with this, however. The above function is not continuous, meaning it's not continuously differentiable with derivative equal to $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ everywhere. Namely, it is discontinuous at $x=(4n\pm1)\pi$ where $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. I noticed, however, that the limit of the derivative on either side of $x=(4n\pm1)\pi$ existed and was equal to each other. Hence, I figured that I could somehow ""stitch"" these continuous sections end to end and get a continuous result whose derivative was $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ everywhere. The resulting function I got was
$$
I = 2\sqrt2\sin\frac x2\text{sgn}\cos\frac x2 + 4\sqrt2\left\lfloor\frac1{2\pi}x+\frac12\right\rfloor + C
$$ Now, I was wondering, is there any way to arrive at this result just by integrating $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ using the usual techniques? The method I used can be boiled down to ""integrating"" then ""fixing"", but I'm just wondering if you can arrive at a result that is continuous and differentiable on the entire real line by doing just the ""integrating"" part. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! Edit: To be clear, I'm not looking for exactly the function above, but rather simply any function that is ""nice"", continuous and differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$, and has derivative equal to $\sqrt{1+\cos x}$ everywhere, and which is attainable through ""simple"" integration methods.","['indefinite-integrals', 'integration']"

2117291,How to compute distribution conditional on two random variables,"I have the following scenario: A fair coin is tossed, and we record the result ""heads"" or ""tails"" as random variable $Z$. If a head is observed, a random sample $X_1,\dots,X_n \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$ is collected, with fixed sample size $n$. If a tail is observed, a random sample $X_1,X_2,\ldots \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)$ is collected until $k$ successes are obtained, for some $k<n$. Let $N$ denote the random variable recording the total number of $X$s observed, and let $M$ denote the number of successes in the observed $Xs$. I must show that the distribution of $Z$, given $N$ and $M$, does not depend on $\theta$. Say $Z=0$ represents ""heads"" and $Z=1$ represents ""tails"". We can then find conditional distributions for random variables $N$ and $M$. Here is what I have found so far. $$\text{P}[N=j\mid Z=0]=\begin{cases}0 & \text{if } j\neq n \\ 1 & \text{if } j=n\end{cases} \\ \text{P}[N=j\mid Z=1]=\binom{j-1}{k-1} \theta^k(1-\theta)^{j-k}, j=k,k+1,\dots$$ $$\text{P}[M=j\mid Z=0]=\binom{n}{j}\theta^j(1-\theta)^{n-j}, j=0,1,\dots,n\\ \text{P}[M=j\mid Z=1]=\begin{cases}0 & \text{if } j\neq k \\ 1 & \text{if } j=k \end{cases}$$ I also know the following result, by the definition of conditioning and using the law of total probability. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{P}[Z=z\mid N=j,M=j]&=&\frac{\text{P}[N=j,M=j\mid Z=z]\text{P}[Z=z]}{\text{P}[N=j,M=j]} \\

First, an exact sequence $0\to A\to B\to C\to 0$ in an abelian category is split if any of the following equivalent conditions hold: the map $A\to B$ has a section, the map $B\to C$ has a retract, $B=A\oplus C'$ for some subobject $C'$ of $B$, and $B=A'\oplus C$ for some quotient object $A'$ of $B$.

Such a chain complex has very nice properties: the maps $s_n$ induce splittings of $C_n$ and $Z_n(C_\bullet)$. Although Weibel's definition has nice properties, it comes from nowhere. 
Is there some way to view his definition as a particular case of the first?

2117793,How do I differentiate under the integral sign here.,"Assume we are working on the interval $[a,b]$, we have that $f \in L^1
 [a,b]$. Let $\gamma \in (0,1)$. We then have that $$\int_a^uf(t)(u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt, u \in [a,b]$$ is well-defined. Because $(u-t)^{1-\gamma}$ is continuous on $[a,u]$,
  and hence bounded. A book I am reading states that: $$\frac{d}{du }\int_a^uf(t)(u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt=(1-\gamma)\int_a^uf(t)(u-t)^{-\gamma}dt.$$ But why is this the case? I tried using the leibniz integral rule . But from what I see I can not use it because the derivative $(u-t)^{-\gamma}$ does not behave well when $t=u$. Another problem I have is that by Fubini/Tonelli we may have that $(1-\gamma)\int_a^uf(t)(u-t)^{-\gamma}dt$ is well defined only  a.e. on $[a,b]$? But do you see how we can prove that identity if $(1-\gamma)\int_a^uf(t)(u-t)^{-\gamma}dt$ is well-defined? I tried writing the definition of the derivative, and then taking limits etc.. But I do not get that the fraction is bounded(so I can use the dominated convergence theorem), because $(u-t)^{-\gamma}$ is not bounded. If I am supposed to solve it using this I get: $\frac{\int_a^{u+\Delta u}f(t)(u+\Delta u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt-\int_a^{u}f(t)(u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt}{\Delta u}=\int_a^u\frac{f(t)[(u+\Delta u-t)^{1-\gamma}-(u-t)^{1-\gamma}]dt}{\Delta u}+\int_u^{u+\Delta u}\frac{f(t)(u+\Delta u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt}{\Delta u}.$ Do you see what happens with the last terms when $\Delta u$ goes to zero?
(If what I wrote in the start is correct, the last term is supposed to go to zero. And in the second last term we are supposed to be able to write the derivative inside, but how do I argue for this using DCT?) ANSWER For those who are interested I think I found the answer. The book I was reading was a book containg articles, and I think the article my quesiton is based on was badly written. I looked at the source for the article and it seemed better. Note first if we can show that $\int_a^u f(t)(u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt=(1-\gamma)\int_a^u[\int_a^t\frac{f(s)ds}{(t-s)^\gamma}]dt , H(t)=\int_a^t\frac{f(s)ds}{(t-s)^\gamma}\in L^1[a,b]$, we are done, because then the result follows from the fundamental theorem of calculus. First we show that $H$ is well defined, and simultaneously show that we can use Fubini to interchange limits.: $\int_a^b\int_a^t\frac{|f(s)|ds}{(t-s)^\gamma}dt=\int_a^b \int_s^b|f(s)|(t-s)^{-\gamma} dtds=\int_a^b |f(s)|(b-s)^{1-\gamma} \cdot1/(1-\gamma)ds<\infty$. And now the same calculuation with $u$ instead of b, and $f(s)$ instead of $|f(s)|$ tells us that $\int_a^u f(t)(u-t)^{1-\gamma}dt=(1-\gamma)\int_a^u[\int_a^t\frac{f(s)ds}{(t-s)^\gamma}]dt$.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'definite-integrals', 'calculus']"

This question was given to me by my Mathematics Teacher as a ""brain teaser"". At first I divided $m \times n$ by $a \times b,$ but then I realized that it is not possible in the given situation, as the ""left over"" cardboard will also be ""divided"" among $a \times b$. Next I tried started thinking it terms of perimeter. I imagined all the $a \times b$ rectangles lying side by side in a ""rows and columns"" format(sort of a grid), without any space between them, thus forming another rectangle/square. I assumed $\lambda$ rows and $\sigma$ columns of those smaller rectangles. After a bit of calculations, my answer came out as following : Number of smaller $a \times b $ rectangles  $\geq \sigma \times \lambda$ = $\left(\dfrac {m - m \, mod \, a }{a}\right) \times \left(\dfrac {n-n\, mod \, b}{b}\right).$ Is my ""second"" approach correct ?

2118317,Does product and sum rule characterize the derivative?,"If $F$ is a field (one can do it in any ring, but lets restrict ourselves to fields), then we can define a formal derivative of a polynomial

as
$$ D_xf(x)=na_nx^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2}+\cdots+2a_2x+a_1 \in F[x].$$
With this definition, one can prove the usual rules for the derivative of the sum and product of polynomials, they are
\begin{equation}\tag{1}
D_x(f(x)+g(x))=D_x(f(x))+D_x(g(x))

and
\begin{equation}\tag{2}
D_x(f(x)g(x))=D_x(f(x))g(x)+D_x(g(x))f(x).
\end{equation} From the product rule we can deduce that $D_x(\lambda f(x))=\lambda D_x(f(x))$ for any $\lambda \in F$ and $f(x) \in F[x],$ so the derivative is a linear map.

I mean, if I have a linear map $L:\mathbb{C}[x]\to\mathbb{C}[x]$ (or $L:\mathbb{R}[x]\to\mathbb{R}[x]$) that satisfies (1) and (2), does it necessarily be the formal derivative? Also, I was wondering if this can be generalized to general linear maps between smooth functions from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$ (or from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$), so that if $L:C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a linear map that satisfies (1) and (2), then $L$ must be the derivative. If not, I was wondering if there is some other conditions that $L$ must satisfy to guarantee that is must be the derivative. I appreciate any comments on the problem. Note: I had a little problem with the tags of this question, as I asked by formal derivative between fields but also consider the question to general linear maps between $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$.

2118349,How to round numbers fairly,"There are $n$ positive numbers, $x_1+\ldots+x_n = 1$ , and a number $S$ .

This can be interpreted as a method for apportionment of seats in congress. In the elections to the congress, there were $n$ parties, and each party $i$ received a fraction $x_i$ of the total votes. There are $S$ seats in the congress, and we want to determine how many seats $s_i$ to allocate to party $i$ . Ideally, we would give each party exactly $x_i\cdot S$ seats, but this number is not an integer, so we have to round it. Naturally, each party demands that its fraction will not be rounded 'too much', i.e, each party demands at least its fractional share $x_i\cdot S$ rounded down to the nearest integer. Moreover, this requirement should hold not only in the general population, but also when we compare each party $i$ against any other subset of parties $J$ : party $i$ should get at least its fractional share of the seats of the subset $J$ , rounded down to the nearest integer. A fair rounding might not exist if some fractions are equal. For example, if $S=3$ , $n=2$ , $x_1=x_2=0.5$ , fairness requires that $s_1=s_2$ , but this is not possible since $s_1+s_2$ is odd. To prevent such edge cases, let's assume that all fractions are different, and moreover, there is no linear combination of fractions with integer coefficients that equals 0.

2118704,Detail in the use of the Residue Theorem for $\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2x)-1}{x^2}dx$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Question about evaluating the integral $\int_0^\infty \frac{1-\cos(ax)}{x^2}dx$ using the residue theorem (2 answers) Closed last year . As usual, I have a ridiculously specific question about a tiny detail of a tiny calculation. There is a tremendous amount of context, so fair warning. I don't need a solution to this whole problem. I need a solution to one specific part, and it is a minor detail. I'll show what I've got so far, and point out my concern at the end. Our problem is to use residue calculus to compute:
$$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\cos(2x)-1}{x^2}dx.$$ We note that this is equal to the real part of the easier-to-work-with integral:
$$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{2ix}-1}{x^2}dx,$$
and we use a ""hippo's back"" contour, formed by the positively-oriented half-circle $|z|\leq R$ in the upper half-plane and the line along the real axis from $-R$ to $R$, interrupted from $-\varepsilon$ to $\varepsilon$ by the negatively oriented half-circle in the upper half-plane of radius $\varepsilon$, so as to 'jump' over the simple pole at $z=0$. Since this contour contains no poles or singularities, etc., the integral of our integrand around it is zero by Cauchy's Theorem. It is also a simple matter to show that the large half-circle's contribution is zero in the limit $R\to\infty$. So now we are left with the fact that in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$, we obtain: $$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{2ix}-1}{x^2}dx=\lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0}\int\limits_{C_\varepsilon}\frac{e^{2iz}-1}{z^2}dz,$$ where $C_\varepsilon$ is the little negatively-oriented half-circle mentioned above. Now, I know the trick in which the value of the right-hand side happens to give exactly $\pi i \text{Res}(f,0)$ (that is, half of what the full circle would give), and can use it to show that the result is $-2\pi$. Okay, thanks for reading this far. Here is my actual question: Without resorting to tricks like the half-residue thing, how can we get this result from the right-hand side? That is, how do we prove rigorously that: $$\lim\limits_{\varepsilon\to 0}\int\limits_{C_\varepsilon}\frac{e^{2iz}-1}{z^2}dz=-2\pi$$ I have been using the parametrization $z=\varepsilon e^{-it}$ with $t\in[0,\pi]$, where the negative in the exponential deals with the negative orientation, which almost always works in these situations, but not here, since the $\varepsilon$ does not entirely cancel from the denominator then as it usually does in these types of problems. I have confirmed the result with Wolfram-Alpha using the original problem statement, and also noted a few other things, like that the original integrand can be expressed as $\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2}$, but gotten nowhere with that. In a pinch, I'll use the 'half-residue' trick, but being able to do this simply from basic principles would be nice.","['complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'residue-calculus', 'complex-integration']"

2118773,broken stick : average of the ratio of the shortest piece to the largest piece,"Frederick Mosteller , 'Fifty challenging problems of probability', Q.42 If a stick is broken in 2 at random, what is the average ratio of the smaller length to the larger ? the answer is given as: Breaking 'at random' means that all points of the stick are equally likely as a breaking point (uniform distribution).

We might suppose that the point fell in the right half. Then $\frac{1-x}{x}$ is the fraction of the stick if the stick is of unit length. Since $x$ is evenly distributed from $1 \over 2$ to $1$ the average value - instead of the intuitive $1 \over 3$ - is:

$$ 2 \int_{1 \over 2}^{1} \frac {1-x}{x}dx = 2 \ln(2)-1 \approx 0.386$$ I don't understand this. Why don't I need to somehow derive the probability density of the ratio of the 2 uniform random variables involved, and then integrate: $$ 2 \int_{1 \over 2}^{1} \frac {1-x}{x}\  \text{pdf_of_the_ratio}(x) \ dx =?$$","['puzzle', 'probability']"

2118857,Simple closed form for $\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+x}\sqrt[4]{8x^2+8x+1}}\;dx$,"Some time ago, I used a fairly formal method (in the second sense of this answer ) to derive the following integral, and am wondering whether it is correct or not: $$\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+x}\sqrt[4]{8x^2+8x+1}}\;dx=\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2}{2^{\frac{11}{4}}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}\tag{1}$$ Wolfram Alpha doesn't evaluate this integral, but gives the first 5 decimal places of the transformed integral $\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{x-x^2}\sqrt[4]{x^2-8x+8}}\;dx$ which are correct . The method I used was formal and convoluted, with much rearrangement of integrals and series whose convergence I did not know; such methods have given me incorrect results in the past (e.g. here and here ). Nevertheless, the integral appears simple and perhaps there is a change of variables which would enable easy evaluation to the RHS (in particular I wonder whether elliptic integrals are involved) but I cannot find one. My question is: is the above result correct, and if so is there a simpler way to prove it than that  below (which feels like I might have almost come in a circle)? Derivation : I began with the fact that $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^n}dx=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{n})}{n}$ and then proceeded as follows: $$\left[\int_0^\infty e^{-x^8}\;dx\right]^2=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{8})^2}{64}=\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty e^{-x^8-y^8}\;dx\;dy=\int_0^\infty\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}re^{-r^8(\cos^8\theta\;+\;\sin^8\theta)}\;d\theta\;dr={\int_0^\infty\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}re^{-r^8(1\;-\;\sin^2\theta\;+\;\frac{\sin^42\theta}{8})}\;d\theta\;dr}={\int_0^\infty re^{-r^8}\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}e^{r^8(\sin^2\theta\;-\;\frac{\sin^42\theta}{8})}\;d\theta\;dr}$$ In order to evaluate the inner integral I used Maclaurin series , the binomial theorem , and freely rearranged integrals and sums as follows: $$\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}e^{a(\sin^2\theta\;-\;\frac{\sin^42\theta}{8})}\;d\theta=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a^n}{n!}\left(\sin^2\theta-\frac{\sin^42\theta}{8}\right)^n\;d\theta={\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{a^n}{n!}\sum_{m=0}^n\frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!}\sin^{2n-2m}2\theta\;\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m\sin^{4m}2\theta\;d\theta}={\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^n\frac{a^n\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m}{m!(n-m)!}\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^{2n+2m}2\theta\;d\theta}$$ Using $\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^{2k}2\theta\;d\theta=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^\pi\sin^{2k}\theta\;d\theta=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^{2k}\theta\;d\theta=\frac{\pi(2k)!}{2^{2k+1}(k!)^2}$, I got: $${\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^n\frac{a^n\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m}{m!(n-m)!}\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\sin^{2n+2m}2\theta\;d\theta}={\frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^n\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)^n\left(\frac{-1}{32}\right)^m\frac{(2n+2m)!}{m!(n-m)!(n+m)!^2}}$$ So that I had: $$\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}e^{a(\sin^2\theta\;-\;\frac{\sin^42\theta}{8})}\;d\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{a}{4}\right)^n\left(\frac{-a}{128}\right)^m\frac{(2n+4m)!}{m!\;n!\;(n+2m)!^2}\tag{2}$$ Substituting $(2)$ into our original integral, using the series and integral definitions of the hypergeometric function , and rearranging integrals and sums gave: $$\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{8})^2}{64}=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^\infty re^{-r^8}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{r^8}{4}\right)^n\left(\frac{-r^8}{128}\right)^m\frac{(2n+4m)!}{m!\;n!\;(n+2m)!^2}\;dr={\frac{\pi}{2}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n\left(\frac{-1}{128}\right)^m\frac{(2n+4m)!}{m!\;n!\;(n+2m)!^2}\int_0^\infty r^{8n+8m+1}e^{-r^8}\;dr}={\frac{\pi}{16}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{n=0}^\infty\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^n\left(\frac{-1}{128}\right)^m\frac{(2n+4m)!}{m!\;n!\;(n+2m)!^2}\Gamma\left(m+n+\frac{1}{4}\right)}={\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{16}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m\frac{\Gamma(m+\frac{1}{4})\;\Gamma(2m+\frac{1}{2})}{m!\;\Gamma(2m+1)}\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(m+n+\frac{1}{4})}{\Gamma(m+\frac{1}{4})}\frac{\Gamma(2m+1)}{\Gamma(n+2m+1)}\frac{\Gamma(n+2m+\frac{1}{2})}{\Gamma(2m+\frac{1}{2})}}={\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{16}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m\frac{\Gamma(m+\frac{1}{4})\;\Gamma(2m+\frac{1}{2})}{m!\;\Gamma(2m+1)}\;_2F_1\left(m+\frac{1}{4},2m+\frac{1}{2};2m+1;1\right)}={\frac{1}{16}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\left(\frac{-1}{8}\right)^m\frac{\Gamma(m+\frac{1}{4})}{m!}\int_0^1 x^{2m-\frac{1}{2}}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1-x)^{-m-\frac{1}{4}}\;dx}={\frac{1}{16}\int^1 x^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1-x)^{-\frac{3}{4}}\sum_{m=0}^\infty\frac{\Gamma(m+\frac{1}{4})}{m!}\left(-\frac{x^2}{8(1-x)}\right)^m\;dx}$$ In order to evaluate a sum of the form present in the integrand I used basic Laplace transform identities and interchanged sum and Laplace transform to get: $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}\frac{\Gamma(n+\frac{1}{4})}{s^{n+\frac{1}{4}}}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{1}{n!}L\left[t^{-\frac{3}{4}}\right](s)=L\left[t^{-\frac{3}{4}}e^t\right](s)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}{(s-1)^\frac{1}{4}}$$ and hence $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^n}{n!}\Gamma\left(n+\frac{1}{4}\right)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}{(1-x)^\frac{1}{4}}$ so that I had: $$\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{8})^2}{64}={\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}{16}\int_0^1 x^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1-x)^{-\frac{3}{4}}\left(1+\frac{x^2}{8(1-x)}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}}\;dx}={\frac{8^{\frac{1}{4}}\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}{16}\int_0^1 x^{-\frac{1}{2}}(1-x)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(8-8x+x^2)^{-\frac{1}{4}}\;dx}$$ From which $(1)$ follows immediately by the substitution $u=\frac{1}{x}-1$.

Let $\epsilon > 0$. We want to find $N$ such that for all $n > N, |x^n\sqrt{n}| < \epsilon$. Now we have $n\log(x) + \frac{1}{2}\log(n) < n + n = 2n < \log (\epsilon)$. So pick $N$ with $N<\frac{\log(\epsilon)}{2}$. My question is, is using logarithms a valid way to approach a question on convergence, and is there a better alternative method to tackle this question? EDIT: Attempt 2:
If $x=0$, then $x^{n}\sqrt{n}=0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and therefore $$\lim_{n\to\infty}x^{n}\sqrt{n}=0$$ So we can assume $x \neq 0$. Then, note that $h = \frac{1}{|x|} - 1 > 0$. From Bernoulli's inequality we have:
$\frac{1}{|x|^{n}\sqrt{n}} = \frac{(1+h)^{n}}{\sqrt{n}} \geq \frac{1+nh}{\sqrt{n}} > \sqrt{n}h.$ Therefore, we have $0 \leq |x|^{n}\sqrt{n} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}h}.$ Now, given any $\epsilon > 0$, we take $N \geq (\frac{1}{\epsilon h})^2$. Now for $n>N, |x^n\sqrt{n} - 0| = |x^n\sqrt{n}| \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}h} < \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}h} \leq \epsilon$. Hence $$\lim_{n\to\infty}x^{n}\sqrt{n}=0$$","['convergence-divergence', 'limits']"
