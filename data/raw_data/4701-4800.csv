34436,Evaluating the contour integral $\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^{3}(x)}{x^{3}}\mathrm dx$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : show that $\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac {\sin^3(x)}{x^3}dx=\frac{3\pi}{8}$ (8 answers) Closed 6 years ago . I am trying to show $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin^{3}(x)}{x^{3}}\mathrm dx = \frac{3\pi}{8}.$$ I believe the contour I should use is a semicircle in the upper half plane with a slight bump at the origin, so I miss the singularity. Lastly I have the hint to consider 
$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{3iz}-3e^{iz}+2}{z^{3}}\mathrm dz$$ around the contour I mentioned. Thanks for any help or hints!","['integration', 'complex-analysis']"
34449,Automorphism group of an abelian group,"We know that for the elementary abelian group $G$ of order $p^n$, its automorphism group is $GL(n,\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Here we consider the group $G$ as a vector space over the field  $\mathbb{F}_p\cong \mathbb{Z}_p$; and every automorphism is an invertible linear transformation of the vector space and conversely, so the automorphism group is $GL(V)\cong GL(n,\mathbb{Z}_p)$. Is it true that the automorphism group of the abelian group  $(\mathbb{Z}_{p^2})^n$ is $GL(n,p^2)$? (I think that it need not be true; I could not apply the technique of above group, because here the group $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$ is a ring, but not a field, so I can not consider the group as a vector space.)",['group-theory']
34452,Yarn-like functions,"When wrapping yarn around a ball you cannot make sharp turns or the yarn will fall off. If we think of the yarn as a curve on the surface of the sphere, we would say it must have curvature less than some small constant m. (meaning the best fit tangental circle must have radius greater than $\frac 1m$) The yarn should be wrapped evenly: it should not overlap itself too often. (This would lead to the yarn ball taking on a non-spherical shape over time. No good!) The distribution of the self-intersections should be of nearly consistent density over the surface of the sphere. The yarn will divide the surface of the sphere in to regions. If $A_i, A_j$ are the areas of any two of these regions then for some small constant F, $|A_i- A_j| < F$, $\forall i, j$. As the curve is extended further and further (wrapped around more times) the density of intersections should increase and $A_i \rightarrow 0$ for all of the regions. I know one answer is a randomly generated curve that deviates from a straight path. Overtime it produces a perfect yarn ball. I want to know if there is a non-random answer to this question. My own try: *In trying to solving this myself I thought it might be a good idea to project the sphere on to the plane, as a Riemann surface. But, since so many of the requirements focus on uniformity, this makes the problem a little strage. Observe: 
The area of the regions will need to increase as we move away from the unit circle toward infinity. If the curve ever passes through the north pole, then the plane version would shoot off to infinity. What I found even more weird is what would happen if the curve simply passed very near, but not through, the north pole. Then, on the plane, the curve would go very far from the origin and then loop back.  By making the curve near enough to the north pole the loops can be as large as we please. 
Since wrapping increases the density uniformly, if we observe the wrapping pattern projected on to the plane it would be like loopy knot that, over time, keeps casting bigger and bigger outlier loops, it would always grow and be un-bounded. (even without any intersection with the north pole!)
The requirement about curvature, would mean that the knot could be more curvy inside of the unit circle, and then grow less curvy as we move away from the origin.
I know of no such curve, and so I abandoned this way of thinking about the problem. But, I thought I'd share. * Updated to add a drawing of the projection idea. Update 2: Maybe if I projected the following polar plot back on to the Riemann sphere? The graph of the form $r= \theta^2 \sin (k \theta)$ produced good-looking results for $0 < k <1$... but all of the graphs are far too dense near the origin. Also, wrapping would start in a lop-sided manner, filling in the bottom of the sphere first then moving up... and never reaching the north pole!  But, maybe there is some way to tweak this? (This graph shows the kind of non-random pattern I have in mind for a solution. In a practical sense a solution to this problem could be used to wind spherical balls of ropes, yarns, or cords in a factory setting. Now, I will think about how I would instruct a robot to wind a yarn ball... if the robot is unable to do things randomly. What would you tell the robot to do? )","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
34458,Pairs of points exactly $1$ unit apart in the plane,"This is a problem I found in a graph theory text, but I can't figure it out. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in a plane, the distance between any two of which is at least one. Show that there are at most $3n$ pairs of points of $S$ at distance exactly one. Experimenting, I figured the way to get the most points of distance exactly 1 would be to lay out the points in a grid made out of equilateral triangles. While building up this grid, it seems that when adding a new vertex, I can connect it to 2 or 3 other points to have distance exactly 1, which implies that I can only add at most 3 new pairs of points 1 unit apart for every point I add, which suggests the result.

34501,Complexity of divisor function,"I've been looking at this the past few days, but can't figure it out. Maybe I don have enough mathematical background, but most probably I'm overlooking something super basic from times long gone. Anyway, my problem: What is the complexity of: $$\limsup _{n \to \infty} \; d(n)$$ With $d(n)$ the divisor function. I know that the average complexity is $O(log n)$ and that the infinum is $2$ (for primes), but I can't figure out the complexity of the limit of the supremum. Ridicule and actual solutions both much appreciated. Also, feel free to retag, I have no clue under what I should tag this. [Edit] I should have mentioned that I was aware of the Wikipedia article. Here's what I don't get about it. Wikipedia states: $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log d(n) \log\log n}{\log n} = \log 2$$ This, I assume leads to: $$d(n) = O(n^{\frac{\log 2}{\log \log n}})$$ But then, as $n \to \infty$, the exponent will go to $0$, since $\lim _{n \to \infty} \log \log n = \infty$. And thus $$\lim _{n \to \infty} d(n) = O(1)$$ That seems wrong, am I making a mistake? And if so, where?","['computational-complexity', 'number-theory']"

34549,Embedding the Infinite Binary Tree in Regular Tilings,"Consider the regular tiling $(m,n)$ in which $m$ $n$-agons meet at each vertex. Most of the time this tilings have to ""live"" in the hyperbolic plane. The edges of its polygons define a graph where two vertices are adjacent if they share an edge of a polygon. I would like to prove that most of these graphs have the infinite binary tree as a subgraph. Of course, it would be impossible to show this for the regular tiling $(4,4)$ because the amount of vertices at a given distance from a given vertex grows quadratically, not exponentially like in the binary tree. However, for most $(m,n)$ this growth is exponential and so the infinite binary tree could fit.  By staring at images of these tilings this seems completely plausible, but I am having troubles formalizing it. I have been able to prove that this indeed happens in $(4,5)$. I tried to use Cayley graph's arguments but got lost. So basically I have the following questions: How can I know if the graph I described for $(m,n)$ is the Cayley graph of a group? And if so, is it the Cayley graph of a well-known group? Is my Cayley argument too complicated and there is a simpler proof? Do you have any tips for drawing the $(m,n)$ tiling?

34569,"Enigma : of Wizards, Dwarves and Hats","I've got quite a hard enigma that require extensive knowledge in mathematics, and I thought some might appreciate it. An evil sorcerer holds in prison an infinite number of dwarves (countably infinite). He gathers them and tells them : 
Tomorrow, I will align you so that the first of you will see all the other dwarves. The second one will see all of them but the first, etc... Then, I will put a hat on each of your heads , black or white. No one can see his own hat, or the hat of those before him. But each dwarf can see the hats of those after him (they've got a good eyesight). And then, beginning with the first dwarf, I will ask each of you to tell me exactly one word, ""Black"" or ""White"" . But you will have to whisper it in my ear, so that no one else can hear it .
Then, when it's done (the sorcerer is quite fast) I'll release the dwarves who rightly guess the color of their hat and keep the rest imprisonned. The dwarves gather after the meeting, and they find a strategy so that only a finite number stay imprisonned . What did they decide? P.S : There is no trick. There is no information given from one dwarf to the other when they say ""Black"" or ""White"" to the sorcerer. They don't grunt or wait a certain time. The dwarves can't escape or do anything fishy.

Nevertheless, the paper I'm reading says: ""A direct computation shows that $\hat{K}_t(\xi)=e^{-it \lvert \xi \rvert^2}.$"" This mysterious direct computation leaves me puzzled. The Fourier transform must be taken in the distributional sense, this is clear to me; I just can't figure out how to carry the actual computation. I'm not necessarily after a fully-rigorous answer.

(Recall that surjectivity may fail on sections.) So, for all that I can tell, we might very well have a situation where $X$ is isomorphic to $\rm{Spec} \, \, A$ for some ring $A$, and yet $\Gamma(X, \mathcal{O}_X) \not \cong A$!

Can the roving rational robot ever reach the rational number 2? Now, of course, I know it is true (I proved it and got the answer correct). However, I'm interested to see whether or not the robot can move from 2011 to 2 in four steps. I know it must move an even number of steps and cannot move in two steps, but that's as far as I was able to prove.

This seems false to me, but it is harder than I expected to find a counterexample. For example, when trying to decompose f(x)=x this way, one can easily see that if our functions are a(x) and b(x), and we can translate and stretch so that we need to solve the functional equations: $a(x)+b(x)=x$ $a(-x)=a(x)$ $b(x)=b(1-x)$ but I do not see an obvious contradiction.

34652,"Examples of compact, nonorientable n-manifolds","Among the best-known examples of nonorientable, compact manifolds are projective spaces. However for these one has the fact that $\mathbb RP^n$ is orientable iff $n$ is odd, so that only ""half"" of them are nonorientable.
This statement relies on the fact that the antipodal map $\alpha$ on $S^n$ is orientation-preserving iff $n$ is odd, and $\mathbb RP^n = S^n/\{id_{S^n}, \alpha\}$ is a quotient manifold. Now, since $S^n$ is precisely the orientation covering of $\mathbb R P^n$, and $\alpha$ is the nontrivial covering transformation on $S^n$, I wondered, whether one could generalise this to arbitrary compact, connected manifolds $M^n$ of dimension $n$. I.e. whether it is true that if $n$ is odd, the nontrivial covering transformation cannot be orientation reversing, which would mean that every such $M$ has to be orientable. I guess this cannot be true so generally, so I went looking for some counterexamples, but neither I myself nor google seems to find any.

makes no sense for some $\varphi \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. But is it enough? I am afraid that this argument is incomplete. Question 2 . More generally, is there some characterization of tempered functions , that is, functions which belong to the space $L^1_{\text{loc}}(\mathbb{R})\cap \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R})$? The only tempered functions that I know are polynomially growing functions . By this I mean the functions of the form $Pu$, where $P$ is a polynomial and $u \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for some $p\in[1, \infty]$. Question 3 . Is it true that all tempered functions are polynomially  growing functions? $^{[1]}$ The definition of tempered distribution I refer to is the following. A distribution $T \in \mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is called tempered if for every sequence $\varphi_n \in \mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $\varphi_n \to 0$ in the Schwartz class sense, it happens that $\langle T, \varphi_n \rangle \to 0$. If this is the case then $T$ uniquely extends to a continuous linear functional on $\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and we write $T \in \mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^n)$.","['gaussian-integral', 'distribution-theory', 'fourier-analysis', 'functional-analysis']"

Here's (my slight paraphrasing of) the section that's bothering me: Let $R$ be a complete DVR and let $S = \operatorname{Spec}R$.  Let $s \in S$ be the closed point.  Let $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow S$ be a proper scheme over $S$ with generic fibre $X$ and special fibre $\mathcal{X}_s$.  For any closed point $x \in X$, the Zariski closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible finite scheme over $S$ and is therefore a local scheme with closed point $\overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$. One then defines the reduction map $r\colon X^0 \rightarrow \mathcal{X}_s$, where $X^0$ is the set of closed points of $X$, by $r(x) = \overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$.  Here are my questions: What is the point of considering the Zariski closure of a closed point?  By definition $x$ is closed precisely when $\{x\} = \overline{\{x\}}$, so this part of the definition seems redundant.  Am I missing something obvious? More importantly, I don't understand how to interpret the intersection $\overline{\{x\}} \cap \mathcal{X}_s$ since the two sets in question don't share a common ""parent"" space.

34780,Prove that $\int_0^x f^3 \le \left(\int_0^x f\right)^2$,"This problem comes from Calculus by Spivak, namely in Chapter 14- ""The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus"".

Prove that for all $x\ge0$ we have $$ \int_0^x f^3 \le \left(\int_0^x f\right)^2. $$ Now, I have a (proposed) solution, so my question is whether the following is correct. We know that both the l.h.s. and r.h.s. of the inequality begin at 0, so we can prove the inequality by showing that the same inequality holds for the derivatives of each side. (If both begin at the same value and one increases more quickly or at the same rate than the other, then that one will also take on a value greater than or equal to the other for all $x\ge0$.) So, we have $$f^3 \le 2f\int_0^x f. $$ If $f=0$ the inequality is clearly satisfied, otherwise we have that $$f^2 \le 2\int_0^x f. $$ We then apply the same logic as before, showing that this inequality holds after differentiating (since, again, both expressions evaluate to 0 when $x=0$). So, we have that $$2ff' \le 2f.$$ We have already taken care of the case that $f=0$ (and the inequality holds anyway for $f=0$) so we end up with $$f' \le 1.$$ This is given, so the first inequality is proven.

clarifying & I'd read a lot of links, wiki's etc... just looking for that kind of

what you need to know to really appreciate these theorems. I guess what I'm asking for is an insightful & human explanation of what these theories
are, what you need to know to lead up to them, why you need to know that certain material & why these things are so powerful (for instance, I believe you can use these to prove the Lagrange Multipliers theorem, though I don't know why it has anything to do with it, I also know that knowing one means you can prove the other & that it doesn't matter which direction you approach from, but again I don't appreciate why that is).

need to know that & why it is so important, than what the theorem says so I'd much

34838,Are there uncountably many non homeomorphic ways to topologize a countably infinite set?,"Today I was fooling around a bit trying to count the topologies on a finite set. I didn't make much progress, so I did some googling and quickly discovered it is an open problem to give a closed form expression for the number $T_n$ of topologies on a set with $n$ elements. At this point I asked myself ""if I can't compute $T_n$, can I perhaps compute $T_\omega$?"". First I wondered whether it is even obvious that there are uncountably many ways to topologize a countably infinite set $X$. It is. For each $S \subset X$, $\{\varnothing, S, X\}$ is a topology so there are at least $c$ ways to topologize $X$. This is a bit of a cheat though since, up to homeomorphism, this topology depends only on the cardinalities of $S$ and $X-S$ for which there are only countably many possibilities. Thus we are lead naturally to the question in the title: Are there uncountably many non homeomorphic topologies on a countably infinite set? The most obvious approach that I could think of was to look at order topologies. Distinct ordinal numbers are not order-isomorphic and there are uncountably many countable ordinals so surely by considering the countable ordinals in their order topologies we exhibit uncountably many nonhomeomorphic spaces... right? There is a gap though because distinct ordinals can be homeomorphic. For instance, if $\alpha \geq \omega$ then $\alpha + 1, \alpha +2, \alpha +3, \ldots$ are all homeomorphic (we can sneak the $n$ isolated points at the end of $\alpha + (n+1)$ into the copy of the $\omega$ at the beginning of $\alpha + 1$). To close the gap, we need to prove that for any countable ordinal $\alpha$ there exists a countable ordinal $\beta > \alpha$ homeomorphic to no ordinal in $[0,\alpha]$. I would be flabbergasted if this did not hold, but to prove it would probably require more set theory than I have at my disposal. If my title question is easily answered (in the affirmative) then, as a follow up question, I would also be interested to know if we can actually determine the number of topologies on a countable set (either topologies proper, or topologies up to homeomorphism). At the moment it would seem I can do little more than supply the obvious upper bound of $2^c$ for both quantities... Added: There have been several nice answers. Nate (whose answer I accepted) provided probably the slickest way to resolve the title question. Martin answers the follow up question by showing that the existence of $2^c$ ultrafilters on $\omega$ (this is proved at his first link) implies the existence of $2^c$ topologies on $\omega + 1$ (hence $2^c$ topologies up to homeomorphism since there are only $c$ permutations of a countable set). Actually it seems the proof that there are $2^c$ ultrafilters can easily be adapted to prove the existence of $2^c$ topologies directly. I'll sketch the argument below while I convince myself I understand what's going on. Let $X$ be the (countable) set of all subsets of $\mathbf{R}$ which are finite unions of intervals with rational endpoints. For any of the $2^c$ sets $S \subset \mathbf{R}$ we get a basis $\mathscr{B}_S$ for a toplogy on $X$ consisting of all sets $U_S(F) := \{ x \in X : x \cap F = S \cap F \}$ as $F$ ranges over finite subsets of $\mathbf{R}$. This is a basis since if $x \in B(F_1) \cap B(F_2)$ then $x \in B(F_1 \cup F_2) \subset B(F_1) \cap B(F_2)$. It remains to check that different subsets of $\mathbf{R}$ give rise to different topologies. In fact, if $\mathscr{B}_T$ is a refinement of $\mathscr{B}_S$ then $S \subset T$. Suppose that $s \in S$. If $\mathscr{B}_T$ refines $\mathscr{B}_S$ then there should exist a finite subset $F \subset \mathbf{R}$ so that $U_T(F) \subset U_S(\{s\})$. Wlog $s \in F$ since $U_T(F \cup \{s\}) \subset U_T(F)$. If $s \notin T$ then we have $s \notin x$ for all $x \in U_T(F)$ while $s \in x$ for all $x \in U_S(\{s\})$ so these basis elements are disjoint. Thus $s \in T$ must obtain and we are done.","['general-topology', 'set-theory']"

I set $a=(0,0)$ and $b=(1,0)$ and get We can see right easily that the only point where the derivative shoul be zero is exactly between the peaks so we guess that $z=\frac{a+b}{2}$. We set it in and easily verify that $p_1(z)=p_2(z)=0$ (so the total derivative will also be 0 at z). Now we have to proove that this is the only solution which is the hard part for me. We can play a bit around with this and get to two final equations (will be right below this). Now the real problem: $(1) 0=\left(a_1-x\right)\left(\left(b_2-y\right){}^2+(\text{b1}-x)^2\right){}^{3/2}+\left(b_1-x\right)\left(\left(a_1-x\right){}^2+\left(a_2-y\right){}^2\right){}^{3/2}$ $(2) 0=\left(b_2-y\right)

As you don't want to disappoint your guests too much, you try to divide the (round) pizza up into $n$ equal pieces, so everyone gets an equal share. You are, however, not in the company of someone with a compass. You do have an unmarked ruler and a pen that can leave a colored, eatable solution on the pizza. You can also fold the pizza as much as you want. You can use the creases on the pizza that are left one the surface of the pizza after one has unfolded it. We assume that the pizza is perfectly round. Question : Is there a method by which we can divide the pizza into any $n$ equal parts using the prescribed materials and rules?

34952,Necessary and sufficient conditions for a helix,"I would like to prove that the following two statements are necessary and sufficient conditions that a curve is a helix. I know that a helix is a space curve with the property that the tangent to the curve at every point makes a constant angle with a fixed direction. I am attempting to prove it but am not sure if some of the logic is right. (i) The Principal normal is orthogonal to a fixed direction (ii) $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = c$ where $\kappa$ is the curvature, $\omega$ is the torsion, and $c$ is a constant. Now for (i) we prove the necessary condition. If my space curve is a helix, it has parametric equations $x = a \cos \theta$, $y = a \sin \theta$, $z = b\theta$. Assume without loss of generality that $a = 1$ and $b=1$. Then performing calculations I find that the principal normal $\overrightarrow{n} = \langle -\cos \theta, -\sin \theta, 0 \rangle$ which is orthogonal to any vector of the form $\langle 0, 0, a \rangle$, $a$ some constant. For the sufficient condition, suppose $\overrightarrow{n} \cdot \overrightarrow{a} = 0$, $\overrightarrow{a}$ some vector with fixed direction. Then by the frenet- serret formulas, $\frac{d \overrightarrow{T}}{ds} = \kappa \overrightarrow{n}$, and hence taking the dot product with $\overrightarrow{a}$ on both sides gives the equation $\frac{d \overrightarrow{T}}{ds} \cdot \overrightarrow{a} = 0$. $(*)$ Now here's the logic. If $T'(s)$ is perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{a}$, where $T$ is my unit tangent vector, then since $T$ is perpendicular to $T'(s)$ it follows that $T$ itself makes a constant angle with $\overrightarrow{a}$. Is this bit of logic right?? Now for part (ii), the bit on necessity is easy as I just use the same helix and get that $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = 1$. It is just the bit on sufficiency that is difficult. I have no idea how to go from $\frac{\kappa}{\omega} = c$ to the fact the tangent vector makes a constant angle to a fixed direction. Please do not give me any full answers for the last bit, but instead pose me some questions that my motivate my understanding of the problem. Edit: Proof of the neccesary condition for (i). If $T \cdot \bar{e} = c$, $\bar{e}$ some vector with fixed direction and $c$ a constant, then differentiating both sides you get $T'(s) \cdot \bar{e} = \kappa \bar{n} \cdot \bar{e} = 0$, by the first of the frenet serret formulas which means that the unit normal vector is perpendicular to some vector with fixed direction.",['differential-geometry']

35010,Which is the Abel's theorem invoked in the context of convergence of this infinite product?,"Motivation: As I wrote in this answer the following product is evaluated in Proposition 5 of Jean-Paul Allouche and Jeffrey Shallit's paper The
ubiquitous Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence $$P=\displaystyle\prod_{n=0}^{\infty }\left( \frac{2n+1}{2n+2}\right) ^{(-1)^{t_{n}}},$$ where $\left( t_{n}\right) _{n\geq 0}=\left( 0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,\ldots \right) $
is a binary sequence defined recursively by $t_{0}=0,t_{2n}=t_{n}$ and $%
t_{2n+1}=1-t_{n}$ for $n\geq 0$. According to the authors the product is
""convergent by Abel's theorem"", but I have no idea which theorem is this.
Due to the properties of $\left( t_{n}\right) $ the terms of $P$ can be
broken into two groups of two terms each (this idea came from Ross Millikan). I got: $$\begin{eqnarray*}
P &=&\displaystyle\prod_{m=0}^{\infty }\left( \frac{8m+1}{8m+2}\frac{8m+4}{8m+3}\cdot 
\frac{8m+6}{8m+5}\frac{8m+7}{8m+8}\right) ^{(-1)^{t_{m}}} \\
&=&\displaystyle\prod_{m=0}^{\infty }\left( 1-\frac{1}{32m^{2}+20m+3}\right)
^{(-1)^{t_{m}}}\displaystyle\prod_{m=0}^{\infty }\left( 1+\frac{1}{32m^{2}+52m+20}%
\right) ^{(-1)^{t_{m}}}\text{.}
\end{eqnarray*}$$ and wonder if this form helps to prove the convergence of $P$ in a similar
way to the proof of the $\displaystyle\prod_{n=0}^{\infty }\left( 1+b_{n}\right) $ (with 
$b_{n}\rightarrow 0,b_{n}>0$) is convergent iff $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty }b_{n}$
is convergent. Question : A - Which is the Abel's theorem the authors refer to? B - Suppose we have a product $$\begin{equation*}
P^{\prime }=\displaystyle\prod_{n=0}^{\infty }\left( 1+b_{n}\right) ^{e_{n}}\qquad (\ast
)
\end{equation*},$$
where [edited] $b_n>0$ is such that $\displaystyle\sum b_n$ converges [end edit], and $e_{n}$ is a sequence that takes $-1$
and $+1$ values. Is $P^{\prime }$ convergent? I think so for if I take the logarithm of 
$P$ I get $$\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty }e_{n}\ln (1+b_{n})
\end{equation*}$$
and this series is absolutely convergent 
$$\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty }\left\vert e_{n}\ln (1+b_{n})\right\vert \leq
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty }\left\vert \ln (1+b_{n})\right\vert

$$\begin{equation*}
\underset{n\rightarrow \infty }{\lim }\frac{\ln (1+b_{n})}{b_{n}}=1.

$$\begin{equation*}
P^{\prime \prime }=\displaystyle\prod_{n=0}^{\infty }\left( 1-a_{n}\right)
^{e_{n}},\qquad (\ast \ast )
\end{equation*},$$
where [edit] $0<a_n<1$ is such that $\displaystyle\sum a_n$ converges [end edit]. 
The limit comparison test would be

Indeed with five sets it is easy to find examples where $|A|+|B|+|C|+|D|+|E|$ is a better approximation to $|A∪B∪C∪D∪E|$ than is the second partial sum: $$|A|+|B|+|C|+|D|+|E| −\left({|A∩B|+|A∩C|+|A∩D|+|A∩E|+|B∩C|+ \atop |B∩D|+|B∩E|+|C∩D|+|C∩E|+|D∩E|}\right).$$ In other words, the ""remainder term"" in inclusion-inclusion is not necessarily monotonically non-increasing.

with $u_i^*\in X^*$ and $v_i\in Y$. Now, there are quite a few tensor norms that I can define on $X^*\otimes Y$ in order to complete the space, e.g. the projective norm 
$$
\epsilon(A)=\inf\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \|u_i^*\|_{X^*} \|v_i\|_Y\right)
$$
where the infimum goes over all such decompositions, and (as I take from R. Ryan, Introduction to Tensor Products of Banach Spaces) 13 more norms you can sensibly define on a tensor product space. Now my question is: is there any of these tensor norms that coincides with the operator norm? The only thing I could show is, that the projective norm if always larger or equal to the operator norm. However, that doesn't help me much, I would need equality.","['banach-spaces', 'operator-theory', 'tensor-products', 'hilbert-spaces', 'functional-analysis']"

35198,Axiom of Choice: Can someone explain the fallacy in this reasoning?,"Not a ""set theory"" guru (apologies if my terms are imprecise), but I have heard that it is an elementary result that the set of rational numbers has a measure of zero - intuitively meaning that the set of rationals is ""less dense"" than the set of real numbers (or equivalently than the set of irrational numbers). However, I read this article which seems to provide a rather simple proof showing that the rationals have a cardinality at least as big as the irrationals, which would contradict the above paragraph.  So at least one of the results should be wrong?  However I cannot find the fallacy in the reasoning in the article - the author places the blame on the axiom of choice (bit of a whipping boy of set theory I think). Any ideas? or is the author's argument sound?","['elementary-set-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

$$\frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{a(y-1)}{x\cdot b}\right)^{x-1} +\frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{a(z-1)}{x\cdot c}\right)^{x-1}+\frac{1}{y}\left(\frac{b(z-1)}{y\cdot c}\right)^{y-1}+2$$ I already know that the first formula is bounded above by 3, and each of the individual terms in both formulas is between 0 and 1. Further, I ran a lot of simulations with different values for $a,b,c,x,y,z$ and the bound seems tight only when $a$ approaches $\infty$ and $x=a+1$, while $b,c$ approach 0 and $y = b+1$ and $z=c+1$. The problem is that I cannot show it formally, because I don't know how to simplify or bound the functions involving the beta functions.

35229,free groups: $F_X\cong F_Y\Rightarrow|X|=|Y|$,"I'm reading Grillet's Abstract Algebra. Let $F_X$ denote the free group on the set $X$.

I am hoping for a simple and short proof , having all the tools of Grillet at hand. Rotman (Advanced Modern Algebra, p.305) proves it only for $|X|<\infty$, Bogopolski's (Introduction to Group Theory, p.55) proof seems (unnecessarily?) complicated, and Lyndon & Schupp's (Combinatorial Group Theory, p.1) proof I don't yet understand. It's the very first proposition in the book; in the proof, they say: The subgroup $N$ of $F$ generated by
  all squares of elements in $F$ is
  normal, and $F/N$ is an elementary
  abelian $2$-group of rank $|X|$. (If
  $X$ is finite, $|F/N|=2^{|X|}$ finite;
  if $|X|$ is infinite, $|F/N|=|X|$). $\square$ Is $N:=\langle w^2;w\in F\rangle$? What is an abelian $2$-group? Elementary? What and how does the above quote really prove?

35240,"Efficiently solving a large, sparse linear system $M(s)ab(s)=c(s)$ (determined by smooth functions) over some range of $s$","I'm looking at a differential equation on the edges of a graph (the application is neuroscience), and the Laplace transform of the solution on most of the edges has a general solution more-or-less of the form $(\mathcal{L}v)(x,s)= a(s)e^{-x/\sqrt{s}} + b(s)e^{x/\sqrt{s}}$, where $x$ is in the interval assigned to the edge and $s$ is the Laplace variable. One of the edges has another term in its solution which has no unknowns and can be evaluated easily. The functions $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ are unknown, but can be found by putting together the boundary conditions for each vertex of my graph. This means substituting $x=0$ or $x=L$ (depending on the direction of the edge) for each edge incident on each vertex, and substituting a value of $s$ ($L$ is the length of an edge). This results in a system of $2m$ independent linear equations in $2m$ variables (where $m$ is the number of edges). We can write this system as $M(s)ab(s)=c(s)$, where $M(s)$ is a sparse matrix whose nonzero entries are smooth functions of $s$, $c(s)$ is a vector mostly consisting of zeros whose entries are smooth functions of $s$, and the unknown $ab(s)$ contains the values of $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ for all edges. The zero entries are zero for every value of $s$. I plan to get the solution $v(x,t)$ for a single value of $x$ on an edge (in the time domain) by finding $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ for that edge, for some range of $s$ (probably a large finite number of discrete values), substituting $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ into the formula for $(\mathcal{L}v)(x,s)$, and feeding the resulting Laplace-domain solution into a numerical inverse Laplace transform ( using a fast Fourier transform ) to get a time series of $v(x,t)$ (for a single value of $x$ and a range of $t$-values). An obvious way to do this is to apply a sparse linear system solver to the system $S$ times, where $S$ is the number of values of $s$ required for the NILT. This could be very time-consuming, and I would like to be able to do this for values of $m$ as large as possible. My question(s) are: Is there a name for this kind of problem? I would be surprised if no-one has encountered anything similar before, but I've no idea what it would be called.
EDIT: These are called parametrised matrix equations . Most of the material about them that I can find is by Paul Constantine. Can the smoothness of the functions defining $M(s)$ and $c(s)$ be exploited to find the array of values of $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ without solving the whole system $S$ times? For instance, is it possible to specify any the circumstances under which interpolation could be used to get intermediate values of $a(s)$ and $b(s)$ without ruining the accuracy of the NILT at the end? Would it be practical to solve this symbolically using a computer algebra system? All of the nonzero matrix entries have a form something like $Ke^{L/\sqrt{s}}$, where $K$ and $L$ are known numbers (and $L$ may be zero). Am I going completely the wrong way about this?","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"

35259,"Random Walk - If $m$ is odd, probability of no equalization in the last $m$ steps in path of length $2m$ is 1/2","I am trying to solve the problems in the Chapter 12 Random Walks of Introduction to Probability by Grinstead and Snell. I am stuck at Problem 6(b) which I quote below ( page 482 ) Problem 6 (a) Show that the probability that a random walk of length $2m$ has a last
return to the origin at time $2k$, where $0 \le k \le m$, equals
$ \frac{{2k \choose k} {2m-2k \choose m-k}}{2^{2m}} = u_{2k} u_{2m-2k} $. (The case $k = 0$ consists of all paths that do not return to the origin at
any positive time.) Hint: A path whose last return to the origin occurs
at time $2k$ consists of two paths glued together, one path of which is of
length $2k$ and which begins and ends at the origin, and the other path
of which is of length $2m - 2k$ and which begins at the origin but never
returns to the origin. Both types of paths can be counted using quantities
which appear in this section. Solution I could solve this part. The proof follows from the hint. We know the probability of 
equalization at $2k$ is $u_{2k} = {2k \choose k}$. The probability of no equalization in $2k$ steps is = $1 - \sum_{m=1}^{k} f_{2m}$
where $f_{2m}$ is the probability of first equalization happening at $2m$. From Problem 2(a), we know $f_{2m} = u_{2m-2} - u_{2m}$. Using this result we get, $1 - \sum_{m=1}^{k} f_{2m} =  1 - [(u_{0}-u_{2}) + (u_{2}-u_{4}) + \ldots + (u_{2k-2} - u_{2k})]$ which on telescoping leads to $1 - u_{0} + u_{2k}  = u_{2k}$ since $u_{0} = 1$ by definition. Thus the probability of no equalization in $2k$ steps is $u_{2k}$ which is same as the probability of equalization in $2k$ steps. Thus in $2m$ steps the probability of equalization in $2k$ and no equalization in the remaining $2m-2k$ steps is $u_{2k} u_{2m-2k}$. Problem 6(b) Using part (a), show that if $m$ is odd, the probability that a walk of length $2m$ has no equalization in the last $m$ outcomes is equal to $1/2$, regardless of the value of $m$. Hint :  The answer to part a) is symmetric in $k$ and $m-k$. I don't understand the hint in this part and I am not sure how to go about solving this problem. I tried the brute force and could not generalize it. This is what I did. I wrote down the sample paths for $2m=6$ and found that at $m=3$ the sum can either be $S_{3} = \{3,1,-1,-3\}$. There are $3$ paths whose sum is either $\{1,-1\}$ and a path each whose sum is either $\{3,-3\}$. The path whose sum is either $\{3,-3\}$ can combine with $7$ paths without equalizing and the paths whose sum is either $\{1,-1\}$ can combine with $3$ paths without equalizing. Thus total number of paths which do not equalize in the latter half ($k = 4,5,6$) of $2m=6$ is = $7 \times 1 + 3 \times 3 + 3 \times 3 + 7 \times 1 = 32$. Thus $32$ out of possible $64$ paths do not equalize the latter half  ($k = 4,5,6$) of the sample path. I tried to generalize this to get an answer of $2^{2m-1}$ but I could not make any headway. I think there must be an easier way based on the hint. Can someone give me more hints on how to solve this problem?","['random-walk', 'probability']"
35264,Congruences for Fermat Quotients,"If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is relatively prime to $p$, then by Fermat's Little Theorem, the Fermat quotient $q_p(a) = (a^{p-1}-1)/p$ is an integer.  A well-known collection of theorems beginning with the work of Wieferich shows that if the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds for $p$, then $q_p(a)$ is divisible by $p$ for every prime number $a \leq 89$. I have stumbled across some congruences between Fermat quotients, and haven't turned up similar ones in a Google search.  I hope someone here is an expert on these and can tell me 1) if these and/or similar congruences are known, and 2)where I can find other proofs than my own, either simple enough to post here or written up somewhere. Here are some examples:
If $p = 2^a-1$ is a Mersenne prime, so $a$ is prime, then $q_p(2) \equiv 2q_a(2) \pmod{p}$.  In particular, since $q_a(2) < p$, a Mersenne prime is not a Wieferich prime (i.e., $q_p(2)$ is not divisible by $p$), a well-known result but not by this proof, I think. If $p = 2^n-3$ is prime for some $n$, then $3nq_p(2) + 1 \equiv 3q_p(3) \pmod{p}$, so in particular by the result mentioned above, the first case of FLT must hold for all such $p$. If $p = 3^n-4$ is prime for some $n$, then $4nq_p(3) + 1 \equiv 8 q_p(2) \pmod{p}$, so again, the first case of FLT must hold for all such $p$. I have proved a few others of this nature and seem to have a way to generate more if I wish. Thanks in advance for any information that you can provide.",['number-theory']
