Then there exists $c \in [a,b]$ with $f'(c) = \alpha$. Please could somebody check my proof? Define $g(x) = f(x) - \alpha x$. Then $g$ is continuous and because $[a,b]$ is compact $g$ attains its minimum on $[a,b]$. Let $x_m \in [a,b]$ be such that $g(x_m) \le g(x)$ for all $x\in [a,b]$. If $x_m \in (a,b)$ then $g'(x_m) = 0 = f'(x_m) - \alpha$ which shows the claim. If $x_m = a$ then $g'(x_m) = g'(a) < 0$. Because $g$ is continuous and $g'(a) < 0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that if $x \in (a,a+\delta)$ then $g(x) < g(a) = g(x_m)$. But this is a contradiction because $x_m$ is the minimum. If $x_m = b$ then again there is $\delta>0$ such that if $x \in (b-\delta, b)$ then $g(x)<g(b)=g(x_m)$ because  $g'(b) > 0$. Again this is a contradiction.

771448,"Show that if polynomials $f,g$ have no common factor in $K[x,y]$, then they have only finitely many common roots [duplicate]","This question already has an answer here : Irreducible polynomials and affine variety (1 answer) Closed last year . I have a homework problem where I have to show that if $f$ and $g$ are polynomials with no common factor in $K[x, y]$, where $K$ is a field, there are only finitely many elements $(a, b)\in K^2$ such that $f(a, b)=g(a, b)=0$. My approach involves looking at $f$ and $g$ as polynomials in $y$ whose coefficients are polynomials in $x$. Then I can write the Sylvester matrix of $f$ and $g$, which is a matrix whose entries are polynomials in $x$. I've shown that if $f$ and $g$ have a common root $(a, b)$, then this matrix's determinant evaluated at $x=a$ would be $0$. Thus, if this determinant, viewed as a polynomial over $x$ is not the zero polynomial, it only has finitely many roots, and thus there are only finitely many values of $x$ that can be in a common root, and I'd be done. Now I have to deal with the case where this determinant is identically the zero polynomial. If so, that means, that for every $a\in K$, $f(a, y)$ and $g(a, y)\in K[y]$ have a common root. I'm not quite sure how to get from this to my desired contradiction... Something that may or may not be helpful is that I was able to show, from Gauss' Lemma and the fact that $K(x)[y]$ is a Principal Ideal Domain ($K(x)$ is the field of rational functions of $x$), that if there's a $b\in K$ such that both $f(x, b)$ and $g(x, b)\in K[x]$ are both the zero polynomial, then $f$ and $g$ have a common factor in the Unique Factorization Domain $K[x, y]$, a contradiction. Does this result help me prove that if the Sylvester determinant is zero, then $f$ and $g$ have a common factor? I know one way of doing this is to prove that the Sylvester Determinant is equal to the resultant, but that proof seems rather long, requiring me to consider the algebraic closure of a field of fractions, and I don't think I need the full force of the result...is there an easier way to prove the weaker result that if the determinant is $0$, then $f$ and $g$ have a common root/factor.

I:=\int_0^\pi \theta^2 \ln^2\big(2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\big)d \theta.
$$
Here is a related Integral $\int_0^\pi \theta^2 \ln^2\big(2\cos\frac{\theta}{2}\big)d \theta$. .  This paper may also be of interest to people here : http://www.math.uwo.ca/~dborwein/cv/zeta4.pdf . We can expand the log in the integral to obtain three interals, one trivial, the other 2 are not so easy, any ideas? I tried doing the following
$$
\left( \ln 2 +\ln \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \right)^2=\ln^2(2)+\ln^2\sin\frac{\theta}{2}+2\ln (2)\ln \sin\big(\frac{\theta}{2}\big).
$$
We can write I as 
$$
I=\ln^2(2)\int_0^\pi \theta^2d\theta  +\int_0^\pi\theta^2 \ln^2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}d\theta+2\ln 2 \int_0^\pi\theta^2 \ln \sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}d\theta.
$$
Change of variables $x=\theta/2$ and performing the trivial integral we obtain
$$
I=\frac{\pi^3\ln^2 2}{3}+8\int_0^{\pi/2} x^2 \ln^2 \sin x\, dx+16\ln 2\int_0^{\pi/2} x^2 \ln \sin x \, dx.
$$
I am stuck at this point, I was trying to somehow work these two integrals into the form of $$
\int_0^{\pi/2} \ln \sin x dx= \frac{-\pi\ln(2)}{2}\approx -1.08879
$$
but couldn't do so.  Thanks.","['improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis']"

For convergence I have $g(0)$ is divergent because we get a sum of 1, but for $x \not = 0$ we get $$0< \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+n^2x^2} < \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2x^2} = \frac{1}{x^2} \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6x^2}$$ and since $g$ is monotonic and bounded it converges (right?) Since the pointwise limit doesn't exist for $x \not = 0$ then $g$ doesn't converge uniformly making proving continuity more difficult. For differentiability I know that if $g_m(x)$ (partial sum of g) is point-wise convergent and $g_m'(x)$ is uniformly convergent then $g'(x) = lim_{m \rightarrow \infty } g'_m(x)$ but again I can't use this due to pointwise limit not existing.

When magnified with the infinitesimal microscope, one would see a straight horizontal line, as all nonstandard numbers would be ""rounded"" to the nearest real. This reminds me of the floor function, but somehow this one doesn't seem to have discontinuities (it really doesn't, for any infinitesimal $\Delta x$, there's always an infinitesimal $\Delta(\text{st}\ x)=0$).

Question: I'm not sure how to approach (c), and feel that my proof for (b) has a dubious step in it that I highlighted below. Attempt for (a): To say that $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ have algebraic orders $h$ and $k$ respectively at $z = a$ is to say that $$
\lim_{n \to \infty} |(z-a)|^{\alpha} |f(z)| = 0 \text{ for all } \alpha > r

771835,Distance point on ellipse to centre,"I'm trying to calculate the distance of a certain point of an ellipse to the centre of that ellipse: The blue things are known: The lengths of the horizontal major radius and vertical minor radius and the angle of the red line and the x-axis. The red distance is the desired result. It is not given where on the ellipse the point is. It can be anywhere on the ellipse. Is this problem possible? If so, in which can this be solved? Thanks in advance! After reading Kaj Hansen's comment and trying a bit this is what I did, it still won't work though. In a triangle, $tan(\theta)=\frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{adjecent side}}$. The slope of a line is $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$. Therefor the slope of the red line is $\tan(\theta)$; the formula of the line is $y=\tan(\theta)\cdot x$. The formula of the ellipse is $\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$. When I put the two formulas together I get 
$$\frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{(\tan(\theta)\cdot x)^{2}}{b^{2}}=1$$ After a bit of rearranging: $$x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}$$ $$$$ $$y=\tan(\theta)\cdot x$$ $$y=\pm \tan(\theta) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}} $$ Now with the help of Pythagoras' theorem $c=\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}$ the red line should be $$\sqrt{\left ( \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}\right ) ^{2}+\left ( \tan(\theta) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}} \right )^{2}}$$ which can be simplified: $$\sqrt{\frac{a^{2}\cdot b^{2} \cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+a^{2}\cdot b^{2}}{a^{2}\cdot (\tan(\theta))^{2}+b^{2}}}$$ This, however, does not give the right answer. Let's try something: $a=2$; $b=1$; $\theta=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi$ (The point is the point where the ellipse intersects with the minor radius) $$\sqrt{\frac{2^{2}\cdot 1^{2} \cdot (\tan(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi))^{2}+2^{2}\cdot 1^{2}}{2^{2}\cdot (\tan(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi))^{2}+1^{2}}}$$ $$\sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot (\tan(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi))^{2}+4}{4\cdot (\tan(\frac{1}{2} \pi))^{2}+1}}$$ But wait, $\tan(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \pi)$ is undefined.

771838,Asymmetric roles that are symmetric in every instance,"This is similar to something else I posted, but this time we'll pretend we've never heard of infinite sets or infinite series.

\end{align} Superficially, it looks as if sine and cosine play symmetrical roles in this trigonometric identity.  And they do as long as the number of terms in $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta+\varepsilon+\zeta$ remains fixed at six for all Eternity. If we go to $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta+\varepsilon+\zeta+\eta$, then the numbers of cosine factors in each term will be $6$, $4$, $2$, or $0$.  If we go to $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\delta+\varepsilon+\zeta+\eta+\theta$ then the number of cosine factors is again odd in each term, but this time the ones with five cosines have a minus sign rather than a plus sign.  But the sine function sees no such changes as the number of terms changes:

1 & + \\ 3 & - \\ 5 & + \\ 7 & - \\ 9 & + \\ \vdots & \vdots

4 & \text{depends on the number of terms in $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\cdots$} \\

$$ So, my vague question is whether this is but one instance of some known phenomenon in combinatorics/logic/set theory/whatever , an account of which would not generally hint at trigonometry. PS: If we had had a cosine of a sum rather than the sine of a sum, then it would still be the sine rather than the cosine for which the sign does not depend on the number of terms in $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\cdots$.  The difference would be that the number of sine factors would always be even (whereas the parities of the numbers of cosine factors would depend on the number of terms in $\alpha+\beta+\gamma+\cdots$).","['set-theory', 'logic', 'trigonometry', 'reference-request', 'combinatorics']"

Also, since $G$ is a closed linear subspace of $H$, then $G$ itself is a Hilbert space. Thus, there exists a unique $y\in G$ such that $f_G(x)=(x,y)$ for all $x\in G$, where $f_G\in G^*$.

772879,Uniqueness of the extension in Hahn-Kolmogorov extension theorem,"Statement: (Hahn-Kolmogorov theorem) Every pre-measure $\mu_0 : \mathcal{B}_0\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ on a Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}_0$ in $X$ can be extended to a countably additive measure $\mu:\mathcal{B}\rightarrow [0,\infty]$. Outline for proof of the existence is the following, construct the outer measure $\mu^*:2^X\rightarrow[0,\infty]$
$$\mu^*(E) := \inf\{\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu_0(E_n) : E\subset \cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n; E_n\in \mathcal{B}_0\},$$
then applying the Caratheodory extension theorem that the set of $\mu^*$-measurable sets forms a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and by restricting $\mu^*$ to $\mathcal{B}$ we get the countably additive measure $\mu:\mathcal{B} \rightarrow [0,\infty]$. At last, check that $\mathcal{B}$ contains $\mathcal{B}_0$ and $\mu(E) = \mu_0(E)$ for $E\in \mathcal{B}_0$, in another word $\mu$ extends $\mu_0$. For uniqueness , if $\mu_0$ is $\sigma$-finite, for two extensions of $\mu_0$, namely $\mu:\mathcal{B}\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ and $\mu':\mathcal{B}'\rightarrow [0,\infty]$, we have $\mu(E) = \mu'(E)$ for all $E\in \mathcal{B}\cap\mathcal{B}'$. My first question where does the non-uniqueness come from? From different outer measures? Or from the Caratheodory extension
  theorem which extends the outer measure to a measure? This is not clear from the existence proof. If the outer measure is unique, is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the $\mu^*$-measurable sets the smallest $\sigma$-algebra which the extension can be done? So all the extensions would agree on this smallest $\sigma$-algebra. Just like Lebesgue measure on Lebesgue measurable sets and Lebesgue measure on Borel sets are both extensions of the elementary measure on $\sigma$(elementary sets) , in this case, is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that we can work with for the extension. To prove this, it suffices to show that given an extension $\mu:\mathcal{B}\rightarrow [0,\infty]$, for any other measure $\nu$ defined on $\mathcal{B}$ which agrees with $\mu_0$ on $\mathcal{B}_0$, we have $\nu(E) = \mu^*(E)$ for $E\in \mathcal{B}$, or to say $\nu = \mu$ on $\mathcal{B}$. Is the above argument sufficient? This is something that I read in a
  note which hinted it would imply this kind of uniqueness. From what I understand, there is a measure on $\mathcal{B}\cap\mathcal{B}'$ which is an extension of $\mu_0$, since both $\mu$ and $\mu'$ can be restricted to this $\mathcal{B}\cap\mathcal{B}'$, we would get the desired result. For $\nu \leq \mu^*$, observe that for each collection $\{E_n\}$ such that $E\subset \cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n; E_n\in \mathcal{B}_0$, we have
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu_0(E_n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \nu(E_n) \geq \nu(\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n)\geq \nu(E),$$
since taking the infinum does not change the inequality, we have $\nu(E) \leq\mu^*(E)$. For $\nu\geq\mu^*$, first assume that $\mu^*(E) <\infty$ so that we can apply an ""$\epsilon$"" argument, then we generalize the result which uses the $\sigma$-finiteness of $\mu_0$. To prove $\nu(E)\geq\mu^*(E)$, it suffices to show $\nu(E)\geq\mu^*(E)-\epsilon$ for each $\epsilon>0$. Let $\epsilon$ be given, we know there exists disjoint $\{E_n\}, E_n \in \mathcal{B}_0$ such that 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu_0(E_n) \leq \mu^*(E) +\frac{\epsilon}{2},$$ 
using the fact that $\mu_0 (E_n) = \nu(E_n)$, $\nu$ is countability additive and (1), we have 
$$\nu(\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n / E) \leq \mu^*(\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n / E)\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2}.$$ Also use the fact that 
$$\nu(\cup_{n=1}^N E_n) =\mu^*(\cup_{n=1}^N E_n) $$
for each finite $N$ together with there exists $N$ such that 
$$\mu^*(\cup_{n=1}^N E_n) \geq \mu^*(E) - \frac{\epsilon}{2},$$
we have
$$\nu(E) \geq \nu (\cup_{n=1}^\infty E_n) -\frac{\epsilon}{2} \geq \nu (\cup_{n=1}^N E_n) -\frac{\epsilon}{2} = \mu^* (\cup_{n=1}^N E_n) -\frac{\epsilon}{2}\geq \mu^*(E) - \frac{\epsilon}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}.$$ Now for the case when $\mu^*(E) = \infty$, cover $E$ with $A_n \in\mathcal{B}_0$ which all have finite $\mu_0$ measure and define $G_k = \cup_{n=1}^k A_k$, we have
$$\nu (E\cap G_k) \geq \mu^*(E\cap G_k)$$
for all $k$. Letting $k$ tends to infinity, $\mu^*(E\cap G_k)$ goes to infinity, then $\nu (E\cap G_k)$ goes to infinity as well$. Last, could you guys check my proof please. Thank you very much!","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
772908,$f$ meromorphic on $\mathbb{\hat{C}}$ $\implies$ $f$ has a finite number of poles,"Setting: Let $f: \mathbb{\hat{C}}\rightarrow \mathbb{\hat{C}}$ be a meromorphic function . Let $\{p_k\}$ denote the set of poles of $f$ inside $\mathbb{\hat{C}}$. Question: Why must $\{p_k\}$ be a finite set? Attempt: I know only how to reason that $\{p_k\}$ is a countable set.  To see this, consider that the poles $p_k$ of $f$ are isolated by definition.  Hence for each $p_k$ there is associated a neighborhood $N_{p_k}$ about $p_k$ s.t. there are no poles inside $N_{p_k}$.  Then we have that $$
j \ne k \implies N_{p_k} \cap N_{p_j} = \emptyset
$$ so that if $\{p_k\}$ were uncountable, we would have that $\bigcup N_{p_k} \subsetneq \mathbb{\hat{C}}$ which is absurd (an uncountable number of neighborhoods of $\mathbb{\hat{C}}$ must cover $\mathbb{\hat{C}}$). So how do I show that $\{p_k\}$ is finite?","['complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

772916,A linear growth model with immigration,"Ill give some background first before asking questions.(the text below is straight out of the book) Each individual in the population is assumed give birth at an exponential rate of $\lambda$ in addition ,there is a an  exponential rate of increase $\theta$ due to external source of immigration. Hence the total birth rate where there are $n$ persons in the system is $n\lambda + \theta$ . Deaths are assume to occur at an exponential rate $\mu$ for each member of the population, so $\mu_n = n\mu$ . Let $X(t)$ denote the population size at time $t$ . Suppose $X(0)= i$ and let $M(t) = E[X(t)]$ . So they will determine $M(t)$ by deriving and then solving a differential equation that is satisfies. we start by deriving an equation for $M(t+h)$ by conditioning on $X(t)$ this yields: $$M(t+ h) = E[X(t+h)] = E[E[X(t+h)\vert X(t)]]$$ Now, given the size of the population at time $t$ then, ignoring  events whose probability is $o(h)$ , the population at time $t+h$ will either increase in size by 1 if a birth or immigration occurs in $ (t,t+h)$ , or, decrease by 1 if a death occurs in this interval, or remain the same if neither of these two possibilities occurs that is given $X(t)$ $$
X(t+h)=
\begin{cases}
 X(t) + 1, & \text{with probability} \quad [\theta + X(t)\lambda]h + o(h) \\
 X(t) - 1, & \text{with probability} \quad X(t)\mu h + o(h)\\
 X(t),     & \text{with probability} \quad 1-[\theta + X(t)\lambda + X(t)\mu]h +o(h)
\end{cases}
$$ therefore, $E[X(t+h) \vert X(t)] =  X(t) + [\theta + X(t)\lambda - X(t)\mu]h + o(h)$ .....
.....
.....(text continues) $\textbf{questions:}$ I understand the first two cases, but the last case i don' t quiet get: $X(t)$ , with-probability $1-[\theta + X(t)\lambda + X(t)\mu]h +o(h)$ . can someone explain this? How do i interpret this statement: $$E[X(t+h) \vert X(t)] =  X(t) + [\theta + X(t)\lambda - X(t)\mu]h + o(h)$$","['statistics', 'stochastic-processes', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"
