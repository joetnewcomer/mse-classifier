if for all $a, b$, the limits $$\lim\limits_{t \to 0} f(at,bt)$$ exist are all are equal. Can the condition of approach in all directions be weakened to the equallty of approach along two distinct lines ?

829277,Weil restriction - from abstract nonsense to a practical procedure,"Let $L/K$ be a finite field extension. Let $X$ be a $L$-scheme, that is $\exists$ a morphism of schemes $\pi : X \to \operatorname{Spec} L$. The Weil restriction of $X$ is a $K$-scheme $W_{L/K}X$ which can be defined in two ways: Definition 1. For every $K$-algebra $A$ the $K$-scheme $W_{L/K}X$ is the representing object of the functor 
  $$ A \longmapsto X(A \otimes_K L) = \operatorname{Mor}_L( \operatorname{Spec}(A \otimes_K L),X) . $$ Construction 2. Taken from https://mathoverflow.net/questions/7715/what-is-restriction-of-scalars-for-a-torus . Now for a more concrete description. Suppose $X=\operatorname{Spec}L[y1,...,yn]/J$ is an affine scheme. Let $d=[L:K]$ and $a_1,...,a_d$ be a $K$-basis of $L$. Then we make the following ""substitution"":
$$ y_i= a_1 x_{i,1}+...+a_d x_{i,d}, $$
thus replacing each $y_i$ by a linear expression in d new variables $x_{i,j}$. Moreover, suppose $J=\langle g_1,...,g_m \rangle$; then we substitute each of the above equations into $g_k(y_1,...,y_n)$ getting a polynomial in the $x$-variables, however still with $L$-coefficients. But now using our fixed basis of $L/K$, we can regard a single polynomial with $L$-coefficients as a vector of $d$ polynomials with $K$ coefficients. Thus we end up with $md$ generating polynomials in the $x$-variables, say generating an ideal $I$ in $K[x_{i,j}]$, and we put $$W_{L/K}X=\operatorname{Spec}K[x_{i,j}]/I \ . $$ The question: While Definition 1 is a very abstract and hard to work with object (abstract nonsense) the second definition is very practical and can be worked with. In particular, for $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}$ the Weil restriction (via the 2nd construction) allows us to see an $n$-dimensional complex variety as a $2n$-dimensional real variety. The question is how to derive Construction 2 from Definition 1.","['category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'galois-theory']"

Determine the maximum possible value of $$ \frac{9\sqrt[3]{b_{3}}}{b_{1}+3} + \frac{4+3b_{1}+2b_{2}+b_{3}}{a_{1}+1} $$ I used Vieta's formulas combined with calculus. I set this expression equal to $y$ and then cubed both sides. Then I tried to use the fact that since $y$ is real, the cubic in $y$ (generated by cubing both sides) will have three real roots. Now, I differentiated the equation w.r.t. $y$ (assuming everything else to be constant). I got a quadratic in $y$ and I then made its discriminant $>0$. Now I used Vieta's formulas. After that I'm stuck since I still have more than one variable left. Also, I'm not yet familiar with multivariable calculus. Any help will be greately appreciated.

829441,Tiling a rectangle and tensor products,"Consider the following theorem: Whenever a rectangle is tiled by rectangles each of which has at least one integer side, then the tiled rectangle has at least one integer side. There is a paper by Stan Wagon with fourteen proofs of this result.
If we replace integer by rational, then it is possible to prove this result using tensor products. Sketch of a proof: ($\otimes = \otimes_\mathbb{Q}$)
Let $a$ and $b$ the sides of the big rectangle and let $(a_i)$, $(b_i)$ the sides of the small rectangles. We have $a\otimes b=\sum a_i\otimes b_i$, using that each rectangle has a rational side we can rewrite this sum as $1\otimes c + d\otimes 1$. Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-linear function such that $\ker f =\mathbb{Q}$ (it is possible to construct it using a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of $\mathbb{R}$). Now, define $\phi:\mathbb{R}\otimes \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ as $\phi(u\otimes v)=f(u)f(v)$. We have
$$
f(a)f(b)=\phi(a\otimes b)=\phi(1\otimes c + d\otimes 1)=0,
$$
so that $a\in \mathbb{Q}$ or $b\in \mathbb{Q}$. Question: Is it possible to write a similar proof for the original question? Comment: As $\mathbb{R}\otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{R} =  \mathbb{R}\otimes_\mathbb{Q} \mathbb{R}$ I would think the answer is no, but maybe we can overcome this problem using different $\mathbb{Z}$-modules.","['tensor-products', 'tiling', 'reference-request', 'abstract-algebra']"
829456,How does one cut onions in a mathematically efficient way?,"Perhaps a math degree and cooking don't go hand in hand, but hopefully they do. I have been thinking about this problem for some time when in the kitchen without making any real progress: How does one cut onions in a mathematically efficient way? For simplicity, let's assume that an onion is perfectly spherical with radius $r$, consisting of $n$ layers of thickness $d = \frac{r}{n}$. Each cut consists of a plane $p_i$ orthogonal to the $xy$-plane (the cutting board) intersecting some (or all) parts of the onion, arranged in some way, dividing them. The goal is to, with a sequence of cuts $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^{N}$, get the onion to consist of a set of pieces (most likely irregular in shape) so that they all have diameter at most $M$. By diameter of a piece, we mean the longest possible distance between two points on the piece. How should the cuts $p_1, p_2, p_3, \dots, p_N$ of the onion be made so that this criterion is fulfilled (all the pieces are small enough) and $N$ is as small as possible? In other words, we don't consider time to be an issue, just the smallest number of cuts. You may rearrange the pieces in any which way between cuts as long as you specify which part goes where. I think it's fair to assume $d < M$, because otherwise the pieces need to be very small and one would just use a blender. Of course, the model isn't perfect , since we have an infinitely long knife on an infinitely large cutting board, but since I never seem to run out of room on it, I think that's OK. Yes, this question is just as ""serious"" as it sounds, but I would very much appreciate your thoughts on this. I welcome everything from ideas on how to approach the problem and sketches of an optimal strategy (I'm a Master student in computational science) to a full-blown perfect algorithm.

829474,(Easy?) consequence of the Riemann Hypothesis,"I'm trying to show that the relation $\psi(x)=x+O(\sqrt{x}\log ^2 x)$ (consequence of the Riemann hypothesis) implies $\pi(x)=Li(x)+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)$, where $Li(x)=\int_2^x \frac{dt}{\log t}$. I haven´t achieved so much towards the solution of this exercise that seems to be easy. This is what i've done: As $\pi(x)\sim \psi(x)/\log x$, we get $$\pi(x)= \psi(x)/\log x+O(\psi(x)/\log x)=x/\log x+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)+O(x/\log x).$$ Using the relation $Li(x)=x/\log x+\int_2^x\frac{dt}{log^2 t}-2/\log 2$, we obtain $$\pi(x)=Li(x)+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)+O(x/\log x)-\int_2^x\frac{dt}{log^2 t}.$$ I can't handle with the last two terms because i guess they are not big O's of $\sqrt{x}\log x$. I would appreciate any orientation. Due to Greg Martin's answer, i've come to this solution, is it right?: Let's suppose that \begin{equation}
\psi(x)=x+O(\sqrt{x}\log^2 x).\end{equation}
We have that \begin{equation}
\psi(x)-\vartheta(x)=O(\sqrt{x}\log^2 x)\end{equation} -proof of theorem 4.1 from Apostol's book-, then 
\begin{equation} E(x):=\vartheta(x)-x=O(\sqrt{x}\log^2 x).\end{equation}
By (1) and theorem 4.2 from Apostol's, we obtain the following
\begin{equation}
\pi(x)-\int_2^x\frac{\vartheta(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{\psi(x)-\vartheta(x)}{\log x}=\frac{\vartheta(x)}{\log x}+\frac{\psi(x)-\vartheta(x)}{\log x}=\frac{x}{\log x}+O(x^{1/2}\log x).\end{equation}  So
\begin{eqnarray}
\pi(x) &=& \frac{x}{\log x}+O(x^{1/2}\log x)+\int_2^x\frac{\vartheta(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{\vartheta(x)-\psi(x)}{\log x} \\
  & = & \frac{x}{\log x}+O(x^{1/2}\log x)+\int_2^x\frac{\vartheta(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{\vartheta(x)-x-O(x^{1/2}\log^2 x)}{\log x} \\
  & = &\frac{x}{\log x}+O(x^{1/2}\log x)+\int_2^x\frac{\vartheta(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{E(x)}{\log x}.
\end{eqnarray}
But \begin{equation}
Li(x)=\frac{x}{\log x}+\int_2^x\frac{dt}{\log^2 t}-\frac{2}{\log 2},
\end{equation} so we get
\begin{eqnarray}
\pi(x) & = & Li(x)-\int_2^x\frac{dt}{\log^2 t}+\frac{2}{\log 2}+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)+\int_2^x\frac{\vartheta(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{E(x)}{\log x}\\
 & = & Li(x)+\int_2^x\frac{E(t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+\frac{E(x)}{\log x}+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)\\
  & = & Li(x)+\int_2^x\frac{O(\sqrt{t}\log^2 t)}{t\log^2 t}dt+O(\sqrt{x}\log x) \\
   & = & Li(x)+O(\int_2^x\frac{\sqrt{t}\log^2 t}{t\log^2 t}dt)+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)\\
   & = & Li(x)+O(2\sqrt{x}-2\sqrt{2})+O(\sqrt{x}\log x)\\
   & = & Li(x)+O(\sqrt{x}\log x).

829508,Concentration inequality of weighted sum of random variables given a tail inequality,"I tried to solve the exercise below which can be seen as a generalization of the Bernstein's concentration inequality. However, I have difficulty bounding the moment generating function of $Z$ (see $(2)$ below) with appropriate terms that yield the desired tail bound following the Chernoff method.

 \exp\left(-\frac{1}{L}\min \left(\frac{t^2}{\left\Vert
 s\right\Vert_2^2},\frac{t^p}{\left\Vert
 s\right\Vert_q^p}\right)\right),\tag{2} \end{align} 
  where $L>0$ is a
  constant that only depends on $p$, but not $n$. I have shown that it suffices to establish
\begin{align*}
\log\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda Z}\right] & \leq \log L + \max\left(\frac{L\left\Vert s\right\Vert_2 ^2\lambda ^2}{4} ,\frac{(p-1)L^{q-1}\left\Vert s\right\Vert_q^q\lambda^q}{p^q}\right).

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda X}\right]& \leq \mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda \left\vert X\right\vert}\right]\\
& = 1 + \lambda \int_0^\infty \mathbb{P}\left(\left\vert X\right\vert > t\right)e^{\lambda t}\mathrm{d}t\\
&\leq 1 + \lambda \int_0^\infty e^{\lambda t - t^p}\mathrm{d}t 
\end{align*}
However, I have trouble (i) simplifying this bound and (ii) use it obtain the desired bound on the cumulant generating function of $Z$ mentioned above which should be independent of $n$. Update: Here's another incomplete attempt. Clearly we have
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda X}\right]&\leq\sum_{k\geq 0}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}\mathbb{E}\left[|X|^k\right].
\end{align*}$$
Furthermore, using $(1)$ we can bound the moments as
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[|X|^k\right]&=\int_{0}^\infty\mathbb{P}\left(|X|^k\geq u^k\right)du^k\\
&\leq \int_0^\infty e^{-u^p}du^k\\
&=\int_{0}^\infty  e^{-u}du^{k/p}=\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{p}+1\right),\tag{3}
\end{align*}$$
where $\Gamma\left(\cdot\right)$ is the Gamma function. Using log-convexity of the Gamma function we have $\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{p}+1\right)\leq \left(\Gamma\left(k+1\right)\right)^{1/p}=\left(k!\right)^{1/p}$, and thus 
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[|X|^k\right]&\leq\left(k!\right)^{1/p}.
\end{align*}$$
Putting this bound back in $(3)$ we obtain 
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[e^{\lambda X}\right]&\leq\sum_{k\geq 0} \frac{\lambda^k}{\left(k!\right)^{1/q}}.
\end{align*}$$
If we can simplify the series in the latter inequality or find a good approximation for it then we might be able to follow the standard Chernoff bound and obtain the desired result. However, so far I haven't been able to simplify the series.","['distribution-tails', 'statistics', 'concentration-of-measure', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

I have some kind of proof, but I think it can't be correct, because it only uses the fact that $R \colon S^2 \longrightarrow S^2$ is well defined and that $R$ is a diffeo. Here is a sketch: I used the fact, that the parallel transport is uniquely determined by the unique parallel vector field $X$ with $X(0) = v$ and $\nabla_t X = 0$ on $\lbrack 0,1 \rbrack$. So I chose a map $(x,U)$ around $p$ and wrote down the differential equations in the basis belonging to the map $(x \circ R^{-1}, R(U))$, which is just given by $R(X_i)$, when $X_i$ are the basis vectors for $T_p S^2$ corresponding to $x$ (is that correct?).
Then I could use linearity of $R$ to show that if I multiply with $R^{-1}$ the differential equations for the parallel transport $P_{\gamma}$ are fullfilled.

Please help me find the logical flaws or counting mistakes in my arguments. The first alleged solution: Since $5$ is a prime number, then $5 \mid a$ or $5 \mid b$.  Without loss of generality, assume that $5 \mid a$. There are $200$ numbers in $\{1,\cdots,1000\}$ that are divisible by $5$. So, we have $200$ choices for $a$. On the other hand, the other number can be anything that we want, except $a$, because in that case the subset will be a singleton. So, we have $999$ choices for $b$. Therefore, there are $200 \times 999=199800$ such subsets. The second alleged solution: There are $200$ numbers that are divisible by $5$ in $\{1,\cdots,1000\}$. To find a $2$-element subset such that the product of its two elements is divisible by $5$ we can find the number of all $2$-element subsets such that the product of its elements is not divisible by $5$ and subtract this quantity from the number of $2$ element subsets of $\{1,\cdots,1000\}$:

829939,Why does this $u$-substitution zero out my integral?,"Here's how I understand $u$-substitution working for an integral. Essentially, it involves substitution of differential expressions, allowing you to cancel out terms of the integrand. When we change the limits of integration, we essentially evaluate $u(x)$ to make sure the value stays the same. $$
\begin{gather*}
\int_{x=0}^{x=2} \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \, dx \\
\text{let $u = 1 + x^2$ so $du = 2x \, dx$ and $dx = \frac{1}{2} du / x$} \\

\frac{1}{2} \left( \left. 2\sqrt{u} \  \right|_{u=1}^{u=5} \right) \\
\sqrt{5} - 1.

$$ That's all well and good. But I can choose anything for my $u$-expression. What if I wanted to let $u = (x)(x - 2)$? Then the limits of integration are $$\int_{u=(0)(0-2)}^{u=(2)(2-2)} \implies \int_{u=0}^{u=0}$$
and so the whole integral becomes zero. Clearly this is invalid. The correct result for the integral is indeed $\sqrt{5} - 1$. But what am I missing here? Why can't I set the integral up like this? My thoughts: This is a definite integral, so there's no ""$+ C$"" constant of integration business going on. (Right?) Even if you end up having some $x$s in your expression because the $u$-substitution doesn't cancel them out, that doesn't matter because you're still integrating over an empty domain. (Right?) Plus, I can also get this to ""work"" with $\int_{y=-r}^{y=r} (r^2-y^2)^{-1/2}y^2\,dy$ with $u = r^2-y^2$, and that can be expressed as $\int_{u=0}^{u=0} u^{-1/2}\sqrt{r^2-u} \, du$, which is completely in terms of $u$.

Suppose that for some $y \in Y$ that $X_{y} \rightarrow k(y)$ is smooth. According to the definition of smooth given in that section, this just means for all $x$ in $X_{y}$, $n=dim_{k(x)}(\Omega_{X_{y}/k(y)}\otimes k(x))$ where $n=dim X - dim Y$. Show that there is an open subset $U$ of $Y$ such that $f^{-1}U\rightarrow U$ is smooth. My idea: It's easy to show that $dim_{k(x)}(\Omega_{X_{y}/k(y)}\otimes k(x)) = dim_{k(x)}(\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x))$. This means that for each $x$ in $f^{-1}(y)$, there is a neighborhood $U_{x}$ such that $dim_{k(z)}(\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(z))\leq n$ for all $z\in U_{x}$. Somehow we need to find a (possibly smaller) neighborhood for which the reverse inequality holds. If $y$ were a closed point, so that $p:X_{y}\hookrightarrow X$ is a closed immersion, then since $X_{y}$ is quasi-compact we can take a finite number of $U_{x_{i}}$ to cover $p(X_{y})$. Then $U=\cap_{i=1}^{n} f(U_{x_{i}})$ is an open subset of $Y$ containing $y$, since $f$ is flat hence open. Then the claim is that this $U$ works. Don't know about the case where $y$ isn't a closed point. also, don't see how proper comes into play. This feels dlose to right to me, but who knows.

We say that $\Pi$ has highest weight $\lambda$ if $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$ and $\mu \prec \lambda$ for all $\mu \in \Pi$. It is immediate that $\Pi$ is closed under the action of the Weyl group. What I want to prove is that for any $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$, there is a unique saturated set $\Pi$ with highest weight $\lambda$. Some ideas: Everything follows once we can prove that the following set is saturated: $$\Pi = \{\sigma \mu: \mu \in \Lambda^+, \mu \prec \lambda, \sigma \in W\}$$ where $W$ is the Weyl group. It is enough to prove that for all $\mu \in \Lambda^+$, $\mu \prec \lambda$ the following holds: For all $\alpha \in \Phi$ and $i$ between $0$ and $\langle \mu, \alpha \rangle$, the element $\mu - i\alpha$ is conjugate under $W$ to some $\mu' \in \Lambda^+$, $\mu' \prec \lambda$. I can see how this holds in the case where $\alpha \in \Delta$. Now $\langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle \geq 0$. Let $0 \leq i \leq \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle$ and $\mu = \lambda - i \alpha$. Consider two cases: If $0 \leq i \leq \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle / 2$: then $\mu$ is dominant, because $\langle \mu, \alpha \rangle \geq 0$ by the condition on $i$ and because $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle \leq 0$ for $\beta \in \Delta$, $\beta \neq \alpha$. If $\langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle / 2 \leq i \leq \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle$: Now using the reflection $\sigma_\alpha$ with respect to $\alpha$, we have $\sigma_\alpha(\mu) = \lambda - j \alpha$, where $0 \leq j \leq \langle \lambda, \alpha \rangle / 2$. So we are done by the first case. How to prove this in the general case? I think it should be enough to do this for positive roots, but I have no idea how to generalize from the case $\alpha \in \Delta$.","['root-systems', 'lie-algebras', 'abstract-algebra']"

Improve this question In a previous question it is asked to represent $f(x)=\dfrac{x}{1-x^2}$ as a power series.
It gave me $\displaystyle\sum _{n=1}^{\infty \:}x\left(2x^2-x^4\right)^{n-1}$.
Then they ask to use the last expression to calculate $\displaystyle\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\:\frac{n}{2^n}$.

830755,"Evaluate $\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-x^2-2xy-y^2}\,dx\,dy$","I would like to compute the following,
$$
\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-x^2-2xy-y^2}\ dx\,dy
$$
It is obvious that we can rewrite the integral above to,
$$
\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{\infty}e^{-(x+y)^2}\ dx\,dy
$$
so we are ending up with something looking like a gaussian integral. I think that a smart substitution would help but all I tried ended up to be something I am not able to compute... I really would appreciate any hint. Thanks in advance!","['multivariable-calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis']"
