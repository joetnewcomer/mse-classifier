116879,Where have I gone wrong? Contour integration $\int_{-a}^a {u\over 1+u+u^2} du$ as $a\to \infty$,"I would like to integrate $\int_{-a}^a {u\over 1+u+u^2} du$ as $a\to \infty$. So I thought I might use the residue theorem. In the complex plane, the singularities occur at $z=e^{\pm i2\pi\over 3}$. So if we close the contour in the upper half plane we enclose $z=e^{i2\pi\over 3}$. This is a covert simple pole, so res$\left({z\over 1+z+z^2};e^{i2\pi\over 3}\right)={z\over 2z+1}|_{z=e^{i2\pi\over 3}}={1\over 2}+{i\over 2\sqrt3}$. So by the residue theorem, the integral is $2\pi i \left({1\over 2}+{i\over 2\sqrt3}\right)=\pi(i-{1\over\sqrt 3})$. But this cannot be the answer since it contains $i$. Where have I gone wrong? Thanks.","['integration', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

116899,"If $f$ is a non-constant analytic function on a compact domain $D$, then $Re(f)$ and $Im(f)$ assume their max and min on the boundary of $D$.","This is a homework problem I got, my attempted proof is: Since $f$ is non constant and analytic, $f=u(x)+iv(y)$ where neither $u$ nor $v$ is constant(by Cauchy Riemann equations) and $u v$ are both analytic in $D$. Therefore $u$ and $v$ both assume their max on the boundary of $D$ (by maximum modulus theorem). Also, $u$ and $v$ have no minimums in the interior of $D$ unless they are $0$. I'm stuck here and don't know how to show that $u$ and $v$ are nonzero. I looked at the answer at the back of the book. They used the Open Mapping Theorem(the image of an open set under a nonconstant analytic mapping is an open set): According to the Open Mapping Theorem, the image under f of any open set D containing z0 in its interior is an open set containing $f (z_0)$ in its interior. Hence, both Re f and Im f assume larger and smaller values in D than the values $Re f (z_0)$ and $Im f (z_0)$. I don't understant the proof given by the book, can someone explain a bit?

116966,"Does a regular function on an affine variety lie in the coordinate ring?(Lemma 2.1, Joe Harris)","I think the proof in for Lemma 2.1 in Joe Harris's book Algebraic Geometry, A First Course , does not work. (The statement is on Page 19, and the proof on Page 61 .) The proof fails because that $gk_\alpha=h_\alpha$ is valid on $U_\alpha$ only, while the last but one equation on Page 61 must work on the whole domain of the regular function. I have been trying to give a proof or find a counterexample. The proof for the case in which the variety is irreducible is easy. In the reducible case, I managed to reduce the question to the following one: Suppose we are working with a algebraically closed field K and a regular function on an open subset of an affine variety is by definition a function locally representable as $F/G$, with $F,G\in K[x_1,...,x_n]$, and $G$ non-vanishing in a neighbourhood. Suppose we have a variety $V\subset \mathbb A^n$, $V=\cup V_i$ is the decomposition into irreducible components. Suppose we have $F,G\in K[x_1,...,x_n]$, such that $G$ divides $F$ in each $K[x_1,...,x_n]/I(V_i)$. Does it follow that $G$ divides $F$ in $K[x_1,...,x_n]/I(V)$? Intuitively, this means that $I(F)~$  contains $I(G)~$  in each component implies the same thing on the whole variety. It seems quite reasonable. But I am not sure whether there will be any abnormality when considering ""multiplicities"". P.S.You may assume that $\cap V_i$ is nonempty, this is adequate for my purpose.

  the distribution of the primes is that we do not currently have too
  many tools with which one can rule out “conspiracies” between the
  primes, in which the primes (or the von Mangoldt function) decide to
  correlate with some structured object (and in particular, with a
  totally multiplicative function) which then visibly distorts the
  distribution of the primes. For instance, one could imagine a scenario
  in which the probability that a randomly chosen large integer ${n}$ is
  prime is not asymptotic to ${\frac{1}{\log n}}$ (as is given by the
  prime number theorem), but instead to fluctuate depending on the phase
  of the complex number ${n^{it}}$ for some fixed real number ${t}$, thus
  for instance the probability might be significantly less than ${1/\log
> n}$ when ${t \log n}$ is close to an integer, and significantly more than
  ${1/\log n}$ when ${t \log n}$ is close to a half-integer. This would
  contradict the prime number theorem, and so this scenario would have
  to be somehow eradicated in the course of proving that theorem. In the
  language of Dirichlet series, this conspiracy is more commonly known
  as a zero of the Riemann zeta function at ${1+it}$. Please note that my motivation is chiefly a philosophical interpretation than a number theoretic one, so it would be very helpful if the reasoning is directed in that way. Thank you.","['prime-numbers', 'intuition', 'soft-question', 'number-theory']"

117022,Probability that sum of rolling a 6-sided die 10 times is divisible by 10?,"Here's a question I've been considering: Suppose you roll a usual 6-sided die 10 times and sum up the results of your rolls. What's the probability that it's divisible by 10? I've managed to solve it in a somewhat ugly fashion using the following generating series:
$(x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6)^{10} = x^{10}(x^6 - 1)(1+x+x^2+\cdots)^{10}$ which makes finding the probability somewhat doable if I have a calculator or lots of free time to evaluate binomials. What's interesting though is that the probability ends up being just short of $\frac{1}{10}$ (in fact, it's about 0.099748). If instead, I roll the die $n$ times and find whether the sum is divisible by $n$, the probability is well approximated by $\frac{1}{n} - \epsilon$.

117024,Complexity of counting the number of triangles of a graph,"The trivial approach of counting the number of triangles in a simple graph $G$ of order $n$ is to check for every triple $(x,y,z) \in   {V(G)\choose 3}$ if $x,y,z$ forms a triangle. This procedure gives us the algorithmic complexity of $O(n^3)$. It is well known that if $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ then the number of triangles in $G$ is $tr(A^3)/6.$ Since matrix multiplication can  be computed in time $O(n^{2.37})$ it is natural to ask: Is there any (known) faster method for computing the number of triangles of a graph?","['algorithms', 'graph-theory', 'computational-complexity', 'combinatorics', 'algebraic-graph-theory']"

117033,Prop. 2.3 Hartshorne: $\varphi:A\to B$ induces a morphism $\operatorname{Spec}(B)\to\operatorname{Spec}(A)$,"I don't fully understand a step in the proof of the above-mentioned Proposition; more precisely, in part (b): If $\varphi:A\to B$ is a homomorphism of rings, $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$, $Y=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, then $\varphi$ induces a natural morphism of locally ringed spaces $$(f,f^*):(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)\to(X,\mathcal{O}_X).$$ As for the proof: I understand how $f$ is constructed and why it is continuous. It's the $f^*$ part I don't quite get yet. If we localize $\varphi$ at a point $\mathfrak{p}\in Y=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, we get a local homomorphism $\varphi_{\mathfrak{p}}:A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})}\to B_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Now for an open set $U\subseteq X$ we should obtain a ring homomorphism $f^*:\mathcal{O}_X(U)\to\mathcal{O}_Y(f^{-1}(U))$. I tried to figure out how that works: the elements of $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ are functions $U\to\coprod_{\mathfrak{q}\in U}A_{\mathfrak{q}}$, while those of $\mathcal{O}_Y(f^{-1}(U))$ are of the form $f^{-1}(U)\to\coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in f^{-1}(U)}B_\mathfrak{p}$. If we compose an $s\in\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ with $f$ from the left, half of what we need is there. I want to use the local homomorphisms $\varphi_\mathfrak{p}$ on the codomain of $s$, but my mind begins twisting when I try to think about the indexing set there. I'm pretty sure it's an easy 'problem'. Does maybe the first equality in
$$\coprod_{\mathfrak{q}\in U}A_\mathfrak{q}=\coprod_{\mathfrak{p}\in f^{-1}(U)}A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})}=\coprod_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})\in U}A_{\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})}$$ already hold (so I could use the $\varphi_\mathfrak{p}$)? Is every point in $U$ already of the form $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$, and is this one-to-one? I guess my thoughts here go in the wrong direction, and maybe someone is able to understand my little crisis and help me out.

In one sense, this is trivially equivalent to the problem of moments: the $n$th moment is a polynomial in the first $n$ cumulants and vice-versa.  But cumulant sequences have a nice property that moment sequences don't have: the set of all such sequences is closed under addition.  So draw a ray out from the origin $(0,0,0,\ldots)$.  If the ray bumps into a cumulant sequence $(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3,\ldots)$, then $2(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3,\ldots),3(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3,\ldots),\ldots$ are also cumulant sequences. For infinitely divisible distributions, for every real $t\ge 0$, the sequence $t(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\kappa_3,\ldots)$ is a cumulant sequence.

117092,Irreducible Representations of Matrix Algebras,"I am currently reading the book Spin Geometry by Lawson/Michelsohn to understand Dirac Operators and related topics. At some point it uses representation theory to classify Clifford Algebras. In particular this book states in I,§5. Theorem 5.6 on p.31: Let $K=\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{H}$ and consider the ring $K(n)$ of $n \times n$ $K$-matrices as an algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. Then the natural representation $\rho$ of $K(n)$ on the vector space $K^n$ is, up to equivalence, the only irreducible representation of $K(n)$. The algebra $K(n) \oplus K(n)$ has exactly two equivalence classes of irreducible representations. They are given by

I think the solution of the problem involves the chain rule or some generalised form, but I can not see how to do it. Any hint or help is appreciated. The situation:
Lets assume we have variables $x_1, \dots, x_4$. These are transformed by a function $f$, which returns more than the given $4$ parameters. For example: $$
f: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^6, \quad
x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \rightarrow (0, x_1 + x_3, 2 \cdot x_1 + x_4, 0, x_2 + x_3, 2 \cdot x_2 + x_4)
$$ The 'output' of $f$, let us call it $\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_6)$, is processed by another function $g$ which is defined as followed: 
$$g:\mathbb{R}^6 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^6, (y_1, y_2, \dots, y_6) \rightarrow (\exp(-y_1), \exp(-y_2), \dots, \exp(-y_6))$$ Then we have a third function $h$ which takes the 'output' of $g$, let us call this 'output' $\mathbf{z} = (z_1, z_2, \dots, z_6)$, and processes it further, returning some single value, so we have $h: \mathbb{R}^6 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. (I will not show the concrete definition of $h$, because I do not think it does help, but rather complicates things.) What I am looking for is the first derivative of $h$ with respect to the original four parameters $x_1, \dots, x_4$. What I tried is to apply the simple chain rule, like in the following. But I am not shure if this is correct or if I do miss something. Let's say we are interested in the first derivative of $h$ with respect to $x_2$. Then I got the following with the simple chain rule:
$$
\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_4} = \frac{dh}{d\mathbf{z}} \cdot \frac{dg}{d\mathbf{y}} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}
$$ While writing this question, I ask myself if I need some 'partial derivative' of $h$ and $g$, but with respect to which parameter? All involving $x_2$? Any help or hints will be appreciated. Thank you! Best,

117147,Why is the domain of a rational function necessarily nonempty,"Let $V$ be an irreducible affine variety. A rational map $f : V \to \mathbb A^n$ is an $n$-tuple of maps $(f_1, \ldots , f_n)$ where there $f_i$ are rational functions i.e. are in $k(V)$. Th map is called regular at the point $P$ if all the $f_i$ are regular at the point $P$. Hence $\mathrm{dom}(f) = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \mathrm{dom}(f_i)$. My book then says that $\mathrm{dom}(f)$ is therefore a nonempty open subset of $V$. I can see why it's open, but I can't see why it has to be nonempty. I can see that each of the $\mathrm{dom}(f_i)$ are nonempty, and that it's true in the case where $V$ embeds into $\mathbb A^1$ and the polynomials are in one variable. So, why is $\mathrm{dom}(f)$ necessarily nonempty? Thanks",['algebraic-geometry']

If $m = 2$ and $n = 10$ (for example), and the subpartitioning was done by splitting the region up equally, when we go from the first region to the second, the partition size is very different. What I want to do is blend the divisions between regions. Suggestions on how I can do this (bearing in mind I'm not that good at maths) welcome! EDIT: Sorry for being unclear. Picture should help. In this pic there's 2 regions divided into 2 and 4 (I couldn't easily draw 10 divisions!). The upper part shows equidistant splitting which is ignorant of what's happening in a neighbouring region. The lower part of the picture is roughly what I want. A key requirement is the nodes in the interval $[80,100]$ go from having larger spacing to smaller spacing the further they get away from the interval $[0,80]$. If there was 10 nodes within $[80,100]$, they'd be mainly bunched up towards 100 and the gaps between the nodes would get progressively smaller. The larger spacing is because of the large division size in the neighbouring interval. The number line could be split up into any number of regions, and the number of divisions on each region is not chosen by me, but imposed on me.

then these four rectangles delimit another rectangular region of points that do not belong to any of $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. It looks obvious on such a picture.  But surely there must be some elegant way to prove this fact. My current approach would be to define each region $R=([R_{x},R_{x'}], [R_{y}, R_{y'}])$ as pair of intervals (the projection on each axis).  Then justify that $[A_{x},A_{x'}]\cap[C_{x},C_{x'}]\ne\emptyset \iff [A_{y},A_{y'}]\cap[C_{y},C_{y'}]=\emptyset$ (otherwise $A$ would intersect $C$ or $B$ would intersect $D$), likewise for $B$ and $D$.   Then by symmetry fix an order on $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, so it looks like in the picture with $A_{y'}< C_{y}$ and $B_{x'}<D_{x}$.  And finally note that rectangular the region $((B_{x'},D_{x}),(A_{y'},C_{y}))$ does not intersect $A$, $B$, $C$, nor $D$.  This looks very clumsy to me.

The solution is a bit tedious to type in latex so I'll give you the cliffs. Define $F(x,y,z) = x + xy + z^3$  and $G(x,y,z) = \sin (xyz)$.

117338,Explaining the motivation behind two different definitions of a generic point,"This question is primarily regarding the definition of a generic point of a topological space that I came across in Qing Liu's Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves . First I will give the definition of a generic point that I am used to: Definition I am used to: Let $X$ be a topological space. A point $x\in X$ is a generic point of $X$ if $x$ is dense in $X$. (In particular this implies that if a topological space has a generic point, then the space must be irreducible. So, reducible spaces do not have generic points.) Definition in Qing Liu's book : Let $X$ be a topological space. Given $x,y \in X$, we say $x$ specializes to $y$ iff $y \in \overline{\{x\}}$. We say $x$ is a generic point of $X$ if $x$ is the unique point of $X$ that specializes to $x$. From what I have been able to deduce so far, under Liu's definition of a generic point, reducible spaces can have generic points. For example if we take a ring $A$, then the generic points of $Spec(A)$ (according to Liu's definition) are all the minimal primes of $A$. And certainly, $Spec(A)$ is reducible unless $Nil(A)$ is a prime ideal. Also, Liu's definition implies that if $O \subset X$ is a non-empty open subset and $x \in O$ is a generic point of $O$, then $x$ is a generic point of $X$. So, something that is locally a generic point is also globally a generic point. This is not true for the first definition. So far I had been happily using the first definition of a generic point, but Qing Liu's definition has thrown me a little off-guard. I guess I do not fully understand the motivation behind Qing Liu's definition, and also the need for two different definitions that are clearly not equivalent. Which definition do people generally use? Looking at Wikipedia it seems that the first definition of a generic point of a topological space is more prevalent. Any explanation or motivation for Qing Liu's definition will be useful, along with an explanation (perhaps?) of why there are two different definitions for the same concept. Also, if answers are too long to type up, then references that explain the concept of generic point are more than welcome. But, I hope they address the questions I have asked.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'terminology']"

Question: What is the centralizer of $\mu$ in $S_n$ ?  That is, what is the subgroup $Z(\mu)$ of all permutations in $S_n$ that commute with $\mu$ ? Note that $\mu$ is the product of $k$ disjoint transpositions, and thus an involution (self-inverse), $\mu = (1\;n) (2\;n-1) \ldots (k\;k+1)$.  Because they are disjoint, these transpositions commute, and it follows that $\mu$ commutes with any product of a subset of these. But such products do not generally account for the entire centralizer $Z(\mu)$.  For example with $n=6$, the permutation $(1\;3) (4\;6)$ commutes with $\mu$ but is not expressible as a product of the disjoint transpositions above that form $\mu$. If possible an explicit characterization of $Z(\mu)$ elements would be preferred, but a construction of generators (valid for all $n$) would also be useful.  The application I have in mind is the enumeration of diagonal latin squares ; see also a related question I posted previously. The idiosyncratic term used there, $\mu$- derangement , may be justified by its definition being equivalent to both a permutation $g$ and $\mu g$ being derangements (permutations without fixed points).

I solved a similar problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (or at least think I did :p). Given $\{u, v\}$ is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$, show that $\{u + v, au\}$ is also a basis. I used the definition of a span to say $\implies cu + dv =\langle x, y\rangle $ (for $c, d$ in $\mathbb{R}$) Let $c = d + a^2$ (for $a$ in $\mathbb{R}$) $\implies (d + a^2)u + dv = \langle x, y\rangle $ $\implies d(u + v) + a(au) = \langle x, y\rangle $ $\implies \mathrm{span}(u + v, au) = \mathbb{R}^2$ From there I also showed that this set was linearly independent (by starting with putting $c$ and $d$ equal to zero) and concluded that, as it had both properties in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it must be a basis. So I've been wracking my brains trying to find ways to manipulate coefficients to achieve the new basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$, but I can't come up with anything.

The vertices are obviously the ends of the edges, and the faces are any collection of three vertices that are all connected by edges (and the 3-faces are any collection of four vertices that are all connected by edges, but there aren't any of either).  If a bunch of vertices are all connected to each other, then their convex hull is contained in the shape (or more combinatorially, they form a face). A hollow tetrahedron or the bi-cone over a triangle are not very good triangulations of the sphere.  In the first case, all 4 vertices are connected to each other, but the convex hull of those connected guys are not in the shape (the tetrahedron wants to be filled in).  In the second case, there is a cycle of 3 points, all connected, but the interior of that triangle is not contained in the shape (this is the equator, and filling it in would make the wedge of two spheres instead of a single sphere). Möbius's 7 vertex triangulation of the torus is also not very nice: it has cycles of length 3 that are spirally candy-stripes around the donut.  In fact, the graph is the complete graph on 7 vertices, so we might even think it had 3, 4, 5, and 6 dimensional faces if we just looked at the graph. I'd like a vertex minimal triangulation of the torus where the underlying graph actually specified the faces (if three vertices are all connected to each other, then they should form a triangle of the triangulation).
