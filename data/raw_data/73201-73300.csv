901969,Must a normed vector space be over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$?,"If it must be, why is this so? In the maths courses I have taken normed vector spaces always have been over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, but I don't see that this has to be so. I am asking because I was proving that if a normed vector space X has a Schauder basis then it is separable, and I had a proof along the lines of this question How to prove that if a normed space has Schauder basis, then it is separable? What about the converse? The problem I had is this proof requires that we have a sequence of rationals converging to the scalars of the vector space. But if the vector space is not $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$ then why should this work? Someone has asked this in a comment to the second answer of the question above, but I do not quite understand the response given: ""The fiel has to be restricted, notably because of the definition of a normed space: an absolute value is needed""
I can see that we do use absolute values on the scalars of the vector space but I'm not then sure why this restricts them to being in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, other than I don't know how to define an absolute value on something other than a real or complex number (but wikipedia seems to suggest it can be done).","['vector-spaces', 'normed-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

902007,Why is continuous differentiability required?,"I have two questions. My book proves that if $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is a holomorphic function, then it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and if we look at the function as $F: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, then this function is differentiable. The point is that we are looking at conditions when we can go from complex differentiability(holomorphic), to differentiability when we look at the function in terms of real variables only ,that is differentiability in multivariate calculus. question 1: The book also has the converse of the above[picture], and in the converse result they write
$ f = u(x,y)+i*v(x,y)$, where $z=x+i*y$, now in the converse result they have that the u and v must be continuously differentiable, why not only differentiable? Do you guys see in the proof where they need to use that it is continuously differentiable and it would fail if they were only differentible? question 2: A related question is: If we have a function $h: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 $. And we know that the partial derivatives exist, but they are not continous, will it may be that h is not differentiable?","['multivariable-calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

902102,The nature of isomorphism between fundamental groups with different base points,"New to algebraic topology. Munkres (Topology, 2 ed.) in the last paragraph on page 332 says that ""If $X$ is path-connected, all the groups $\pi_1(X,x)$ are isomorphic, so it is tempting to try to ""identify"" all these groups with one another and to speak of the fundamental group of the space X, without reference to base-point"". He goes on to say that there is no ""natural way of identifying"" these groups and ""different paths...may give rise to different isomorphisms between these groups."" I just don't get this at all. If groups are isomorphic, they are the same algebraically. What does ""different isomorphisms between groups"" mean? Again on the following page (334) he says that even in a path-connected space, the induced homomorphism map is an isomorphism, and ""these groups are isomorphic, [but] they are still not the same group"". This is driving me nuts. The Klein-$V_4$ group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z_2} \times \mathbb{Z_2}$ and $D_4$; OK they do not ""arise"" naturally the same way, but they are the same algebraically and up to isomorphism. My question is this: Agreed in a space not path-connected, you cannot dispense with the base-point; why is that a problem in a path-connected space?

902107,"Is there an easier way to find the ""natural"" integration constant?","Suppose we take consequtive derivatives of a function at a point and then interpolate them with Newton series (Newton interpolation formula) so to obtain a smooth curve. $$f^{(s)}(x)=\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \binom {s}m \sum_{k=0}^m\binom mk(-1)^{m-k}f^{(k)}(x)$$ If the series converges at $s=-1$ we take this value to be the ""natural"" value of antiderivative of $f$ at the point $x$ (assuming that integral is the -1-th derivative). For instance, for function $f(x)=a^x$ the expansion converges (if converges, which is not the case for all $a$) to $a^x (\ln a)^s$, or $(\ln a)^s$ at $x=0$. Thus antiderivative of $a^x$ should naturally have value of $\frac{1}{\ln a}$ at $x=0$.

As I'm discussing all the mathy stuff and insights gained over the summer, I cannot help but notice that many of my peers in second or third year undergrad cannot bridge the gap between vectors and functions.

basically pointy arrows in $R^2$ and written with brackets $\{\}$ or sometimes with
arrow on the top Functions are completely different, they are the object under study in calculus, never drawn as an arrow, doesn't
satisfy some axioms of vector space, can be drawn in a lot of ways
(piecewise or continuous, with crazy oscillations). You can do a lot with functions, such as taking the derivative of it,
or the integral of it. You can find the inverse of a function. No authority has ever said functions are vectors, if they did I would
believe them Yes, functions are sometimes contained in brackets, but that is just a
vector of functions, not a function Can someone please provide a good example may bridge this gap? Also, is there any books that explicitly bridge the two concepts? Thank you for your inputs!","['linear-algebra', 'calculus', 'vectors', 'functions']"

902247,Monotonic curvature and self intersections.,"I'm trying to prove that if $\alpha: I \to \Bbb R^2$ is a differentiable curve, where $I$ is an interval, has strictly monotonic curvature, then $\alpha$ has no self-intersections. My attempt : We suppose WLOG that $\alpha$ is parametrized by arc-length. If the curvature $\kappa$ is strictly monotonic, and is defined on an interval, then $\kappa$ is injective. We consider $t_0, t_1 \in I$ such that $\alpha(t_0) = \alpha(t_1)$, and I want to prove that $t_0 = t_1$. If I manage to get $\kappa(t_0) = \kappa(t_1)$, then I'm done. For me, it is rather clear that this will be indeed the case, but I'm failing to justify that. My first thought was that: $$\alpha(t_0) = \alpha(t_1) \implies \alpha'(t_0) = \alpha'(t_1) \implies \alpha''(t_0) = \alpha''(t_1) \implies \kappa(t_0) = \kappa(t_1)$$
and so we would use $\kappa$'s injectivity to get $t_0 = t_1$. But the first two implications are clearly false, in general. Is there some way to use the hypothesis we have to conclude these implications, or is there another approach to the problem whatsoever? Thanks for your time. On the other hand, I think that this might be false, since we could ""glue"" some curves together, like this: What to do? Edit: As pointed by Semiclassical in the comments, the image on the pic is not a counter-example, since the curvature first increases, then decreases.

902306,On the definition of groups of multiplicative type,"Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0. The definition of a linear algebraic $k$-group of multiplicative type (m.t.) I've seen the most in the literature is that $G$ is of m.t. if it is a $\bar{k}/k$-twist of a closed subgroup of a torus. Some authors however define $G$ as a commutative group which is an extension of a finite group by a torus. Why are these two definitions equivalent? Also, from the first definition it's clear that a closed subgroup of a group of m.t. is again a group of m.t. From the second definition this is not that clear. Let me expand this a bit. Suppose $G$ is of m.t. Then $G$ is commutative and fits a s.e.s. $1 \to H \to G \to F \to 1$ with $H$ a torus and $F$ finite. Take a closed (commutative) subgroup $G'$ of $G$. How do we construct a s.e.s. $ 1 \to H' \to G' \to F' \to 1$ with $H'$ a torus and $F'$ finite such that $G'$ fits it? What I'm having trouble is seeing why $H'$ should be a torus again.

902311,The Day Camp Stacking Game,"My friend works at a day camp as a counselor and he told me about an interesting game he plays with his group of kids. You have a perfectly shuffled, regular $52$-card deck and a group of $2 \leq n < 52$ kids under your supervision. You ask the kids to sit in circle and randomly distribute a card to each one of them. Thus, each individual gets either a red or a black card (depending on the suit) that they stick on their forehead for everyone to see. The counselor then sits in the middle of the circle and passes through the remaining $52-n$ cards from top to bottom of the deck and show each card to the group. The rules are as follows: Each kid has an assigned chair to start the game. This chair can either be vacant or occupied during the game and cannot be moved. If a red (resp. black) card is shown, each kid with a red (resp. black) card sits on the chair to his/her left. If someone is already on the chair, the kid sits on him/her. If a kid has someone on top of him/her, he/she cannot move when his/her color is drawn, i.e. only kids on top of a stack can move. If two kids have the same color and this color is drawn, they rotate (shift) clockwise by $1$, $e.g.$ if $n=4$ and the colors are $RRBR$ and red is drawn, then the new configuration is $R \sharp (BR) R$, where $(BR)$ means black kid under red kid and $\sharp$ denotes an empty seat. It is possible that no kid moves on a card. The game ends when there are no more cards in the deck. Everybody wins in this game, like any day camp game. I found this game extremely fascinating due to its underlying mathematical structure. It gives rise to some deep mathematical problems which I am currently trying to understand. Let's assume the game does not stop when the deck of cards is empty, but instead after some multiple (called turn ) of the remaining cards are shown, i.e. after $(52-n)m$ cards are shown for some $m$. I wish to analyse two cases, namely cycling though the deck after each turn or shuffling the deck after each turn. By cycling , I mean that the first card that was shown in the first turn is the first card shown in the second turn and so on. In case of cycling, what is the probability that, at some point in the game, all $n$ children are stacked on top of each other? What about shuffling? In both cases, what happens when we let $m \to \infty$? I know very little about probabilities, let alone combinatorics, but I feel like these questions might be difficult to answer. This problem might even be undecidable. The game somewhat reminds me of an ""ordered"" version of the Tower of Hanoi with additional rules, which I know how to solve but I can't see how it could be useful in the current situation.

902320,Is there a theory of integration in elementary terms for definite integrals?,"Let's call a real number explicit if it can be expressed starting from integers by using arithmetic operations, radicals, exponents, logarithms, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. For complex numbers $i$ is allowed in addition to integers, and we get what Chow calls EL numbers . Rational numbers, $e=\exp(1)$ and $\pi=\cos^{-1}(-1)$ are explicit, some algebraic numbers and Euler's $\gamma$ probably are not. If a function has an elementary anti-derivative then a definite integral of it with explicit limits is also explicit. The converse is not true, $\int x^{-2}e^{-\frac1{x^2}}dx$ is not elementary, but $\int_0^1 x^{-2}e^{-\frac1{x^2}}dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ is explicit (this is the Gaussian integral up to substitution). There is a theory of Liouville that allows proving that some anti-derivatives are not elementary, is there something similar for definite integrals? There was a long standing unanswered question on MSE about computing $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac1{(1+x^2)(1+\tan x)}dx$, and the consensus was that it's not expressible in elementary terms. How does one prove something like that? EDIT: Since there doesn't appear to be a general theory any non-trivial example of a proof for a particular case would be interesting. Also, explicit or EL numbers above are only an example, proving non-expressibility in some other reasonable terms would also be interesting.","['closed-form', 'calculus', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'elementary-functions']"

902401,Families of Idempotent $3\times 3$ Matrices,"I did the following analysis for $2\times2$ real idempotent (i.e. $A^2=A$) matrices:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}^2=\begin{bmatrix}a^2+bc&(a+d)b\\(a+d)c&bc+d^2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}
$$
So in particular we have $(a+d)c=c$ and $(a+d)b=b$ so if either $b$ or $c$ is nonzero we have $a+d=1$. We also see that $a$ and $d$ both satisfy the equation $x^2+bc=x\iff x^2-x+bc=0$ which is a quadratic equation having solutions
$$
x=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4bc}}{2}=0.5\pm\sqrt{0.25-bc}
$$
But this is only possible if $bc\leq 0.25$ for otherwise the above expression is not real. This gives us the following cases: CASE 1: If $b,c=0$ we have $x\in\{0,1\}$ and since $a+d=1$ is unnecessary we have four possibilities: $(a,d)\in\{(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\}$. CASE 2: If $bc=0.25$ we have $x=0.5$ so $a=d=0.5$. CASE 3: If $bc<0.25$ yet $(b,c)\neq(0,0)$ we have $x\in L=\{0.5-\sqrt{0.25-bc},0.5+\sqrt{0.25-bc}\}$ and to have $a+d=1$ we must have $\{a,d\}=L$ so that if $a$ is one solution, then $d$ is forced to be the other solution. Or the other way around. The cases can be illustrated via the following diagram graphing the hyperbola $xy=0.25$ corresponding to CASE 2 , the area $xy<0.25$ corresponding to CASE 3 , and the point $(0.0)$ corresponding to CASE 1 : The blue bands show the graphs of $xy=k$ for $k=0.05$ to $0.20$ and the cyan bands show $xy=k$ for $k=-0.05,-0.10,...$ For instance one could choose $(b,c)=(3.75,-1)$ so that $\sqrt{0.25-bc}=2$ thus rendering $x=0.5\pm 2=-1.5$ and $2.5$ and form the matrix
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}-1.5&3.75\\-1&2.5\end{bmatrix}

902445,Is it absolutely certain that repeated random selection of integers from 0 to 100 will eventually select every integer?,"I would like to know if one can be absolutely certain, after a number of trials, to circle every integer from 1 to 100 using the following method: Let's say you write down integers 0 to 100 from left to right. Then take one 6-sided die and roll it. The result gives the number of integers from 0 to move to the right along the number line you wrote down. Circle that number. Do it again, moving along the number line and circling numbers. So if on the first roll the die resulted in a 3, you move 3 spaces from zero to the number 3. If the second roll results in a 5, you move 5 spaces from the number 3, to the number 8. Then circle number 8. So now you have 3 and 8 circled. Do this all the way up through the numbers until the last die roll results in a number that would put you past 100. Call this set of results ""layer 1"". Now repeat this again on the exact same set of numbers, with some already circled. This will be called ""layer 2"". Then do ""layer 3"" and so on until all numbers from 1 to 100 are circled (if possible). What I am puzzled by is that common sense tells me that eventually all numbers from 1 to 100 will be circled. This appears to me to be absolutely certain. But the results depend on die rolls, which are based on probability, which says there's a small chance that 1 billion ""layers"" can still leave one number uncircled. I would guess that a resolution to this would be that there's a limit to how many layers of this there could be before all numbers are circled. Or is there always going to be some probability that billions of layers of this can be done with still one or more numbers uncircled?

Hartshorne defines nonsingular points using the Jacobian matrix in $\mathbb{A}^n$ and proves proves that this is the same as the local ring being regular. Then the book proceeds to define nonsingular points for arbitrary varieties as having regular local rings.

Since the local ring of $P$ in $U_0$ is the same as that in $\mathbb{P}^2$, it is sufficient to consider the image of the curve under the isomorphism in $U_{0}\to\mathbb{A}^2$.

Show that if $Y$ is compact, then $X$ is compact. My question is, are the assumptions that $p$ be continuous and surjective even necessary for the result to hold?  I've done the following: Let $U$ be an open set containing $p^{-1}(\{y\})$.  Since $X-U$ is closed, $p(X-U)$ is closed in $Y$.  Then $W=Y-p(X-U)$ is an open set that contains $y$.  Since $(X-U)\cap p^{-1}(W)=\varnothing$, $p^{-1}(\{y\})\subset p^{-1}(W) \subset U$. Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $X$.  Then $p^{-1}(\{y\})\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}U_k$.  For each $y\in Y$, define $W_{y}$ as above; then $\{W_y\}$ is an open cover of $Y$, so can be covered by $W_{y_1},...,W_{y_m}$, and $p^{-1}(\{y_j\})\subset p^{-1}(W_{y_j})\subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{N}U_k$.  Since $X=p^{-1}(Y)$, $X=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} p^{-1}(W_{y_j})$.  Since each $p^{-1}(W_{y_j})$ is covered by finitely many $U_k$, so is $X$, so it is compact. If we dispense with surjectivity of $p$, the only thing that happens is that $p^{-1}(\{y\})$ may be empty, but then $p^{-1}(\{y\})\subset p^{-1}(W)$ holds vacuously, and the empty set is still compact. If $p$ is continuous, then $p^{-1}(W)$ is open, but I don't use the fact that it is open at all in my proof. I know that all 3 assumptions make a map ""perfect"" so that may be why they were mentioned, but can we dispense with continuity and surjectivity?

I've tried to find the point of intersection between the tangent line and the $y$ axis and then calculate $\|P-Q \|^2$ but I got stuck. $$\|P-Q\|^2=\|(\gamma_1(t_0),-\frac{\gamma_2'(t_0)}{\gamma_1'(t_0)}\gamma_1(t_0))\|^2$$ I've calculated 
$$\gamma'(t_0)=\left(\cos(t),-\sin(t)+\frac{\sec^2(\frac{t_0}{2})}{2\tan(\frac{t_0}{2})} \right),$$

902714,"Prove that $f$ is differentiable in $(0,0)$ if and only if $\lim_{t\to0+} g(t)$ exists","Let $g:[0,\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ be a mapping and $f(x,y)=xg(\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$ for all $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R^2}$. Prove that $f$ is differentiable in $(0,0)$ $\iff$ $\lim_{t\to0+} g(t)$ exists. My attempt: $\implies:$ We suppose that $f$ is differentiable in $(0,0)$, that is, there is a linear mapping $A=(a_1 \,\, a_2)$ such that $$f(x,y)-f(0,0)-A(x,y) = R(x,y)$$ where R is a remainder term satisfying $\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{R(x,y)}{|(x,y)|} = 0$. Given the definition of $f$, we see that $f(0,0)=0$, so that $$f(x,y)-A(x,y) = R(x,y) \\ \iff xg\big(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\big)-A(x,y) = R(x,y) \\ \iff g\big(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\big) = \frac{R(x,y)}{x}+\frac{1}{x}A(x,y) = \frac{R(x,y)}{x}+\frac{1}{x}(a_1x + a_2y).$$ Now we use polar coordinates: $x=r\cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin\theta$, which gives $$g(r) = \frac{R(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)}{r\cos\theta}+\frac{1}{r\cos\theta}(a_1r\cos\theta+a_2r\sin\theta) \\= \frac{R(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)}{r\cos\theta}+a_1+a_2\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$$ Now taking the limit as $r\to0$ the first term vanishes and we see that the limit is $$a_1+a_2\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}.$$ $\impliedby:$ Now we suppose that $\lim_{t\to0+} g(t)$ exists. I will calculate the two partial derivatives and then show that the matrix $$A = \big(\partial_1 f(0,0) \,\,\, \partial_2 f(0,0)\big)$$ is indeed the derivative of $f$ in $(0,0)$. We have that $$\partial_1 f(0,0) = \lim_{t\to0} \frac{f(t,0)}{t} = \lim_{t\to0}\frac{tg(t)}{t}=\lim_{t\to0}g(t) = M$$ for some finite $M$; and $$\partial_2 f(0,0)=\lim_{t\to0}\frac{f(0,t)}{t} = 0.$$ We shall now investigate $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)} \frac{f(x,y) -f(0,0) - A(x,y)}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}.$$ Using polar coordinates this becomes $$\lim_{r\to0} \frac{r\cos\theta \,g(r) - Mr\cos\theta}{r} = \lim_{r\to0} \cos\theta \,g(r) - M\cos\theta = 0,$$ as desired.

But I can't see this physically. I can think of instances in which the sequence may close up, then diverge, then close up again at infinity. What stops the sequence from coming as close as $\epsilon_1$ to the limit, then diverging, then coming back after some elements. Of course, the Cauchy sequence does not allow this, but I don't see how this instance violates the basic definition of an existence of a limit. The basic definition simply requires that $\forall \epsilon >0\exists N \in \mathbb{N}\  s.t. |s_n -s| < \epsilon$.

My answer is that the set $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ is closed in the box topology hence, its closure is itself. Here is my justification of my answer: Suppose $x=(x_1,x_2,\dots)$ is not in $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$.
  So for some $i_1,i_2,i_3,\dots$ we get, $x_{i_j} \neq 0$ for $j=1,2,3,\dots$ It's clear that for every $x_{i_j}$, there is a neighborhood $U_{i_j}$ of $x_{i_j}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $0 \not\in U_j$. Now, let $U=\prod_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i$ where $A_{i_j}=U_{i_j}$ and $A_i$ is any open set of $x_i$ for $i \neq i_j$ for $j=1,2,3,\dots$ Now, $U$ is a neighborhood of $x$ but $U\cap \mathbb{R}^{\infty}=\emptyset$ so $x$ is not a limit point of $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$ hence is not in the closure of $\mathbb{R}^{\infty}$. Why is $U\cap \mathbb{R}^{\infty}=\emptyset$? Because for every element $y=(y_1,y_2,\dots)$ of $U$, there are an infinite number of $y_i$'s such that $y_i\not=0$ (by definition) so $y\not\in \mathbb{R^{\infty}}$.

I am aware that there is a similar question elsewhere, but I need help with my proof in particular. Can someone please verify it or offer suggestions for improvement? Show that $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\Delta = \{(x, x):x \in X\}$ is closed in $X \times X$ The proof is trivial if $|X|=1$. So, assume that $|X|>1$. Suppose $X$ is Hausdorff. Let $(a, b) \in X \times X - \Delta$. Note that such an element exists, since $|X|>1$. Then, $a \neq b$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, we can pick open sets $U_a$ and $U_b$ such that $a \in U_a$, $b \in U_b$, and $U_a \cap U_b = \varnothing$. Now, note that $(U_a \times U_b) \cap \Delta = \varnothing$ (Assume $(p, q) \in (U_a \times U_b) \cap \Delta.$ Then, $(p,q) \in \Delta$ implies that $p = q$. But then, $p \in U_a$ and $p \in U_b$, contradicting the fact that $U_a \cap U_b = \varnothing$). This implies that the set $X \times X - \Delta$ is open in $X \times X$. So, $\Delta$ is closed in $X \times X$. Now, suppose $\Delta$ is closed in $X \times X$. Then, $X \times X - \Delta$ is open in $X \times X$. So, there exists a basis element $U \times V$ of $X \times X$ such that $(a, b) \in U \times V$ and $U \times V \subseteq X \times X - \Delta$. This implies that $(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \varnothing$. Then, $a \in U$ and $b \in V$. Note that $U \cap V = \varnothing$. If such were not the case, then there exists a $y \in U \cap V$. This implies that $(y, y) \in U \times V$, contradicting the fact that $(U \times V) \cap \Delta = \varnothing$.

903143,Show $\sin(x+h) \cdot \cos x - \cos(x+h) \cdot \sin x = \sin h$ (without limits please - straight trigonometry only).,"I've tried an algebraic approach using the identity $\sin(x) = \sin(x+h-h) = \sin(x+h)\cos(h) - \cos(x+h)\sin(h)$, leading to a complicated expression I'm having trouble simplifying: $[\sin(x)\cos(h) + \cos(x)\sin(h)]\cos(x) - [\cos(x)\cos(h) - \sin(x)\sin(h)][\sin(x+h)\cos(h)-\cos(x+h)\sin(h)]$ (further expansion of $\sin(x+h)$ and $\cos(x+h)$ in this expression did not help me). Use of this identity was a hint in the book I came across this in, What is Mathematics, by Courant and Robbins, p. 422.

903188,Homology commutes with direct sum and product?,"I'm looking at exercise 1.2.1 from Weibel's An Introduction to Homological Algebra . (I need to show that homology commutes with direct sum and direct product.) Is it possible to show that cokernels commute with direct sum and product? Since $H_{n} (C)=\ker d_{n}/ \operatorname{im} d_{n+1}$, $H_{n} (C)=\operatorname{coker} d'_{n+1},$ where $d'_{n+1}:C_{n+1}\rightarrow \ker d_{n}\subset C_{n}$. Or, if I can show that kernels, images, and quotients commute with direct sums and products, would that also prove the statement? I can start with $\oplus(\ker d_{n})=\ker(\oplus d_{n})$, $\oplus(\operatorname{im} d_{n+1})= \operatorname{im}(\oplus d_{n+1})$, then $\oplus (\ker d_n /\operatorname{im} d_{n+1})=\ker \oplus d_n / \operatorname{im}\oplus d_{n+1}$ or $\oplus \ H_n (C)=H_n (\oplus \ C)$ where $ \oplus \ d$ is the differential for the chain complex $\oplus \ C. $ Similar statements for direct product. So my questions are, is it true that quotients, image, and kernel commute with direct sum and product? I think its easy to see that image and kernel commute with direct sum and product but I don't know how to prove it. I'm not so sure about quotients.","['homological-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"

903277,About composition of Holder functions.,"Let $f,g$ be Holder continuous functions with respective exponents $\alpha, \beta \in (0,1)$. More precisely $f \in C^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^n)$, $g\in C^{\beta}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R})$. I am wondering whether the composition $g \circ f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is Holder of exponent $\min \{\alpha,\beta \}$, i.e, if $g \circ f \in C^{\min\{\alpha,\beta \}}(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R})$. This is claimed on a paper I am reading but I don't know how to prove it. The naive approach would be: $$
|g(f(x+h))-g(f(x))| \le [g]_{\beta}|f(x+h)-f(x)|^{\beta} \le [g]_{\beta} |h|^{\beta \alpha} [f]^{\beta}_{\alpha}
$$ so we have $g \circ f \in C^{\alpha \beta }(\mathbb{R}^n)$. But $\alpha \beta < \min \{\alpha,\beta\}$, so this is not very helpful. Any help would be welcome. Thak you.","['fourier-analysis', 'partial-differential-equations', 'holder-spaces', 'real-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
903280,Finding the expected value of a function of random variables,"I'm having troubles with finding marginal density functions and expected values in my probability theory class.
