5450,How do I solve inequalities of the form $\left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right| \geq 1$?,"I'm stuck trying to solve an inequality of the form $\left|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right| \geq 1$; specifically, $\left|\frac{2x + 5}{x + 1}\right| \geq 1$ I tried the approach that was taught for solving inequalities in general, and solved first for x when the part enclosed in absolute value signs is  $\geq 1$, and then solved for when it is $\leq -1$, but plugging in numbers for the resulting domain $[-4, -2]$ back into the original inequality resulted in some answers that were not $\geq 1$. Where have I gone wrong in trying to solve this inequality? How is this different from solving an inequality like $\left|\frac{3}{x + 1}\right| \geq 1$? EDIT : Okay, since I'm clearly messing this up horribly(and now realize that I was absent-mindedly taking the intersection and not the union of my results in spite of having not mixed up the two many times before), I'll edit with the specifics of the solution I was trying and which had me confused before I asked the question. So: $\left|\frac{2x + 5}{x + 1}\right| \geq 1$ Meaning 1: $\frac{2x + 5}{x + 1} \geq 1$ or 2: $\frac{2x + 5}{x + 1} \leq -1$ Tackling the first: multiplied 1 by $x + 1$, forgetting to account for the fact that $x + 1$ could potentially be negative: $2x + 5 \geq x + 1$, then rearrange for $x \geq -4$. Now the other inequality: multiplied -1 by $x + 1$, again forgetting to consider $x + 1$ being negative: $2x + 5 \leq -x - 1$ , rearrange and divide by 3 for $x \leq -2$. Domain is the union, so $[-4, \infty] \cup [-\infty, -2]$, so $R - { 1 }$. This is obviously not right, as plugging in -3 shows. So, in inequalities where the denominator is some function g(x), if I split it and choose to multiply, will I have to solve each part of the inequality twice(once assuming g(x) is positive, a second time assuming it's negative) and then check which solution makes sense by plugging in numbers?","['inequality', 'absolute-value', 'algebra-precalculus']"

5481,Van Dyke's matching rule,"I am looking at Perturbation Theory by E.J. Hinch. The author introduces Van Dyke's matching rule: (m term inner)(n term outer) = (n term outer)(m term inner) To be used to match the terms in an inner solution to the the terms in the outer solution for some perturbed differential equation. Hinch when comparing with introducing intermediate variables says: 'Van Dyke's matching rule usually works and is more convenient.' Does anyone know an example where this matching rule doesn't work? Edit In section $5.2.6$ of the book above, the author gives an example of where the matching rule is meant to fail. Is this an example where the matching rule actually fails or just shows some care in comparing terms is required? In particular, would the intermediate variables approach have any problems?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'perturbation-theory']"
5505,"Extension of previous problem, involving $\ell^p$ norm circles","If you look at this previous problem , I asked how to find the sum of all the areas between two taxicab geometry circles. However, upon learning about $\ell^p$ norms , I thought it would be pretty interesting to extend the problem to all $\ell^p$ norm circles, not just $\ell^1$ (taxicab). If $p=1$, then the result has already been found (the total area is $\frac{5k^2-k-4}{2}$). If $p = \infty$, then each ""circle"" is just a square, and the area is also easily found (I'm too tired to think about it, but I think it would just be $4(k^2-1)$). Is there, however, a general formula for the area of each circle and the total area of the regions between circles in terms of $k$ and $p$; that is, what is the equation for the area of each overlapping region? The area of an individual circle, if I did it correctly, is the area of a LamÃ© curve with $r = p$ and a radius of $k-n$ (see the linked problem ), which equals $\displaystyle 4(k-n)^2\frac{(\Gamma(1+\frac{1}{p})^2)}{\Gamma(1+\frac{2}{p})}$. This can be reduced to $\displaystyle 2(k-n)^2 \frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{p})^2}{p \Gamma(\frac{2}{p})}$ (see equations 41 and 42 here ). Here are some explanatory pictures: $k=5, p=1$ $k=5, p=2$ $k=5, p=3$","['geometry', 'calculus', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

5537,"Does projectivizing always fix problems at infinity? (Or, am I making a mistake somewhere?)","This question is motivated by the following homework problem.  I'm trying to explicitly compute the homeomorphism $f:S^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{CP}^1$ by using stereographic projection and considering $\mathbb{CP}^1 = \mathbb{C}\cup {\infty}$.  I'll want to prove that this is an isometry, where $S^2$ has the standard angle metric and $\mathbb{CP}^1$ has the Fubini-Study metric given by $d(\overline{x},\overline{y})=2\cos^{-1}|(x,y)|$, where $x,y\in \mathbb{C}^2$ are unit vectors (and presumably $(-,-)$ is the usual Hermitian inner product).  Later, I'll use this to explicitly compute the Lie group homomorphism $U(2)\rightarrow SO(3)$. My stereographic projection is from the north pole, takes the equator to the unit circle, and puts the south pole at the origin.  What I've gotten so far is that for $z\not= 1$, \begin{equation*} f(x,y,z)=\left( \frac{x}{1-z} , \frac{y}{1-z} \right) = \frac{x+iy}{1-z} = [x+iy : 1-z ], \end{equation*} where these are coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbb{C}$, and $\mathbb{C}\subseteq \mathbb{CP}^1$ respectively.  This is troublesome, because philosophically I'd expect that I should be able to define this for $(x,y,z)\not= (0,0,1)$ and then end up with a function to projective space that extends continuously over the north pole; that's sort of the point of projective space, to make $\infty$ into just another point.  However, it is not immediately obvious that this works, although luckily \begin{equation*} \left| \frac{x+iy}{1-z} \right| = \sqrt{ \frac{|x+iy|^2}{(1-z)^2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{1-z^2}{(1-z)^2}}, \end{equation*} and the limit of this expression as $z\rightarrow 1^-$ is indeed $\infty$. So, fair enough.  This ends up extending to a continuous function after all.  But: Am I wrong in my philosophical understanding of projective space? (For what it's worth, I tried using my calculations to verify that $f$ is an isometry, and it didn't look like it was going to work out.  So maybe I really am just doing something wrong.)","['projective-space', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"

5568,Why are some mathematical constants irrational by their continued fraction while others aren't?,"Catalan's Constant and quite a few other mathematical constants are known to have an infinite continued fraction (see the bottom of that webpage). On  wikipedia (I'm sorry, I can't post anymore hyperlinks because of my low rep.), a condition for irrationality of that continued fraction is given (see 'generalized continued fractions'). It is said that a given continued fraction converges to an irrational limit if $ b_n > a_n $ in the continued fraction $b_0 + a_0/(b_1 + a_1/(b_2 + a_2/(...b_n+a_n)))$ for some sufficiently large $n$. In the webpage I provided you with, however, the degree of the polynomial $a_n$ of the continued fractions is bigger than the one of $b_n$. Therefore, all values of $b_n$ will never exceed all values of $a_n$, even after some large $n$. My question is: Why does the degree of $a_n$ need to be smaller than the degree of $b_n$ in order for a continued fraction representation of a constant to be irrational? I think I read somewhere it had to do with something like 'Tietschzes criterion' (but I'm not sure).

5607,Very ample sheaf on a blowup,"Suppose one wants to prove that a $1$ -dimensional integral proper scheme over an algebraically closed field is projective. This is a step in how Hartshorne has you prove that any $1$ -dimensional proper scheme (over an algebraically closed field) is projective. The method is that first note the normalization is non-singular and hence projective. Consider $f: \tilde{X}\to X$ , and let $\mathcal{L}$ be a very ample sheaf on $\tilde{X}$ . The goal is to prove that there is an effective divisor $D=\sum P_i$ such that $\mathcal{L}(D)\simeq \mathcal{L}$ and such that each $f(P_i)$ are non-singular points. The rest of the proof follows from the fact that there merely exists some very ample sheaf with that property, but the exercise seems to imply that any very ample sheaf satisfies this property. I think I'm missing something really obvious, but take a proper curve over $k$ , say $C$ , that has a single singularity. Blow-up that singularity, $\pi: \tilde{C}\to C$ , this is the normalization. Take a point $P\in \tilde{C}$ such that $\pi(P)$ is the singularity. It seems to me that $D=P$ is an effective divisor, so $\mathcal{L}(D)$ is an invertible sheaf. If the above is correct, then $\mathcal{L}(D)$ cannot be very ample. Does anyone have a simple reason for this?",['algebraic-geometry']

5641,Is addition continuous?,"I'm going to ask a very silly question, so I'm begging you to be understanding if it is absolutely trivial, or if it's an exercise in some Bourbaki. I'm afraid of asking you, because the question entails this particular case: is the addition of (a finite, but variable quantity of) real numbers a continuous function? Ok, let me try to explain what I mean. I'm insisting in doing exercices about topological groups, see if I can understand something about those previous question 1 , question 2 and question 3 . This one should be more elementary. Let $G$ be a topological Abelian group, written additively, and let $I$ be an arbitrary set. I don't mind if you take $G = \mathbb{R}$, with the usual Euclidian topology and the usual addition of real numbers, but you cannot assume $I$ is finite, nor countable. Let $$
G^I = \prod G = \prod_\alpha G_\alpha , \qquad \text{where}\ G_\alpha = G \qquad \text{for all}\ \alpha \in I \ .
$$ Let us denote  $(x_\alpha)$ the elements of $\prod G$. This is an Abelian topological group with the usual product topology and operations defined component-wise: $$
\begin{align}
(x_\alpha) + (y_\alpha) &= (x_\alpha + y_\alpha)  \\\
-(x_\alpha)              &= (-x_\alpha)
\end{align}
$$ Consider also the weak product $\prod' G$ (aka, direct sum ). That is, elements of $\prod' G$ are those tuples $(x_\alpha) \in \prod  G$ such that $x_\alpha = 0$, except for a finite number of indexes $\alpha \in I$. $\prod'G $ is of course a subgroup of $\prod G$, $\prod' G \subset \prod G$. Let's consider the subspace topology on $\prod' G$, induced from the product topology on $\prod G$. Then we have a well-defined addition map that we hadn't in $\prod G$: $$
\sum : \prod ' G \longrightarrow G \ , \qquad  (x_\alpha ) \mapsto \sum_\alpha x_\alpha \ .
$$ This makes sense, despite the fact $I$ is not necessarily an ordered set because, given an element $(x_\alpha) \in \prod'G$, if $x_{\alpha_1}, \dots , x_{\alpha_n}$ are its non-zero components, we don't have a canonical choice in order to perform the addition $x_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + x_{\alpha_n}$. Nevertheless, since the sum is associative and commutative, we may do it as we please: the result will always be the same. Hence $\sum_\alpha x_\alpha$ is well-defined. Question. Is this map $\sum$ continuous? That is, if you don't like too much abstraction in your life, but prefer to be very specific: is the sum of real numbers $$
\sum: \prod' \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} \ , \qquad (x_\alpha) \mapsto \sum_\alpha x_\alpha
$$ continuous? Remark 1. The question seems silly, doesn't it? Well, maybe it is, but the first answer that came to my mind is wrong, as far as I can see: you cannot say ""this $\sum$ is continuous because it is a composition of continuous maps""; namely, the iteration of the addition of $G$. Yeah, but: which composition? Notice that there is no canonical choice for doing the addition in an specific order -there could be no order at all in $I$. So every time you compute $\sum_\alpha x_\alpha$ you can change the order in which you perform the (continuous) sums $x_\alpha + x_\beta$. So, $\sum$ is not a composition of a finite number of specific maps. (Edit. Previous Remark 2 was wrong.)","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"

where the sets are pairwise disjoint (in $j$) such that $h_n \to h$ pointwise almost everywhere?

5657,"Prove that the interior of the set of all orthogonal vectors to ""a"" is empty","I made a picture of the problem here: If the link does not work, read this: Let $a$ be a non-zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let S be the set of all orthogonal vectors to $a$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. I.e., for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $a\cdot x = 0$ Prove that the interior of S is empty. How can I show that for every point in S, all ""close"" points are either in the complement of S or in S itself? This is what I attempted: Let $u\in B(r,x) = \\{ v \in \mathbb{R}^n : |v - x| < r \\} $ So $|u - x| < r$ Then, $|a||u - x| < |a|r$. By Cauchy-Schwarz, $|a\cdot(u-x)| \leq |a||u - x|$. Then, $|a\cdot u - a\cdot x| < |a|r$. If $u\in S$, then either $u\in S^{\text{int}}$ or $u\in \delta S$.  ($\delta$ denotes boundary). If $u\in S^{\text{int}}$, then $B(r,x) \subset S$, and $a\cdot u = 0$. But then the inequality becomes $|a|r > 0$ which implies $B(r,x) \subset S \forall r > 0$, but this is impossible since it would also imply that $S = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $S^c$ is empty, which is false. Therefore, if $u\in S$, then $u\in\delta S$. Hence, $\forall u\in B(r, x)$ such that $u\in S$, $u\in\delta S$. Thus $S^{\text{int}}$ is empty.",['general-topology']

 By David G. Wells . Anyway, the books lists many assertions without proof, only references which I can't find. One I could not solve for myself said that not all even numbers are values of $\phi(n)$. The sequence of even non-values of $\phi(n)$ starts: $14, 26, 34, 38, 50, 62,\dots$ After thinking about it for a while, I've made little headway. Looking at 14 specifically, I suppose if such a solution $a$ to $\phi(x)=14$ were to exist, $(a,m_i)=1$ for $1\leq i\leq 14$, for some $m_i\lt a$ and so there must also exist inverses $\overline{a_i}$ such that $\overline{a_i}a\equiv 1 \pmod {m_i}$ for each $i$. I'm looking for some contradiction, possibly of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, to show such $a$ cannot exist. Is there some way to generalize which values are not taken by $\phi$, or at least explain why this is the case? I was hoping to see why $14$ is the least such integer such that this is true, but values $1$ to $13$ must be indeed taken. I suppose this would also explain why 26 is the next such value that is not taken, while $15$ to $25$ are.","['prime-numbers', 'number-theory']"
5666,Napier's Rules applied to spherical distance calculations,"I was in the middle of writing the same old geographic distance calculation using the Haversine formula when it occurred to me: shouldn't there be simpler way to do this? Haversine is of course derived from the Law of Cosines. But in thinking about this problem, I ran across Napier's Rules for right-angled spherical triangles. It seems like Napier's Rules should apply, after all Latitude small circles and Longitude great circles always intersect at right angles, so you should be able to draw a right-angled spherical triangle where the hypotenuse connects any two points (unless the case devolves into a line or single point). So if I'm applying Napier's Rules correctly, if our delta latitude and delta longitude in radians are $a$ and $b$ respectively, the angle $c$ should trace the arc between the two points. So Napier says: $\sin(\pi-c) = \cos(a) \cos(b)$ Which should then simplify to: $c = \arcsin(\cos(a) \cos(b))$ But when I try to verify this with a couple test points, the result doesn't match the Haversine formula. Is there a mistake in my (admittedly rusty) algebra or is my mistake in assuming I can apply Napier's Rules to this problem?","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'spherical-geometry']"

5697,Coloring the faces of a hypercube,"I will restate the 3-D version of the problem. In how many ways can you color a regular cube with 2 colors up to a rotational isometry. The answer is of course a special case of Burnsides Lemma which can be used to show that the number of distinct face permutations is $\frac{1}{24}(N^6 + 3N^4 + 12N^3 + 8N^2)$ where $N$ is the number of colors used, $2$ in this case, which gives us an answer of $10$ distinct permutations. My question is how can you expand this to a tesseract, and then more generally, to any hypercube. The rotational isometries of a cube are somewhat simple to comprehend, but the rotational isometries o hypercube are difficult to grasp (even after an hour of playing with the 4d rubiks cube app) My initial thought was to consider the expansion of a tesseract as 8 interconnected cubelets. For the two color case each one of these cubelets has 10 distinct states. Which gives us $10^8$ non-distinct permutations of the hypercube. Or more generally, this reduces to how many distinct ways one can color a 8 faced 3-dimensional figure using 10 colors. So the complicated question of 4-dimensional isometries reduces to 3 dimensional rotational isometries of a octahedron.

\in \mathcal{G}$.  Proving the uniqueness of $Y$ is easy, but
existence is harder.  I am looking for a nice existence proof with
minimal prerequisites. The traditional proof is to invoke the Radon-Nikodym theorem: the
signed measure $\nu(A) = E[X;A]$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal{G})$ is
absolutely continuous to $\mu = P|_\mathcal{G}$, so take $Y$ to be the
Radon-Nikodym derivative, and it clearly has the desired properties.
But the proofs I know of the Radon-Nikodym theorem, while elementary,
are somewhat involved (at least 2 pages, even if you only do the

$K = L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{G}, P)$ is a closed subspace of the Hilbert
space $H = L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$; then take $Y$ to be the

that $Y$ has the desired properties.  But this is not as suitable

We can see that there is a series whose partial sums are always below our series, but which diverges.

Obviously some terms are left out of the sequence on the left, which is fine since our sequence of terms on the left is already greater than the right side. Notice the right side can be grouped into $\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + ... $ because we will have $10$ $\frac{1}{80}$s, $100$ $\frac{1}{800}$s, etc etc. Thus we are adding up infinitely many 1/8s. This is similar to the idea of the divergence of the harmonic series. So, my conclusion is that it diverges. A bunch of other students in my real analysis class have come to the conclusion that is, in fact, convergent, and launched into a detailed verbal explanation about comparison with a geometric series that I couldn't follow without seeing their work.

I guess this anti-commutative nature of wedge product does not work for Lie algebra valued one-forms since tensoring two vectors is not commutative. If the vector space in which the vector valued differential form is taking values is $V$ with a chosen basis ${v_i}$ then books use the notation of $A = \Sigma _{i}  A_i v_i$ where the sum is over the dimension of the vector space and $A_i$ are ordinary forms of the same rank. I would like to know whether this $A_i v_i$ is just a notation for $A_i \otimes v_i$ ? Similarly say $B$ is a vector valued differential form taking values in $W$ with a chosen basis ${w_i}$ and in the same notation, $B = \Sigma _j B_j w_j$. Then the notation used is that, $A \wedge B = \Sigma _{i,j} A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ I wonder if in the above $A_i \wedge B_j v_i \otimes w_j$ is just a notation for $A_i \wedge B_j \otimes v_i \otimes w_j$ ? $A$ and $B$ are vector bundle valued differential forms (like say the connection-1-form $\omega$ or the curvature-2-form $\omega$) then how is $Tr(A)$ defined and why is $d(Tr A) = Tr( d A)$ and $Tr(A \wedge B) = Tr(B \wedge A)$ ? Is $A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A = 0$ ? for $A$ being a vector bundle valued $1$-form or is only $Tr(A \wedge A \wedge A \wedge A) = 0$ ? If A and B are two vector bundle valued $k$ and $l$ form respectively then one defines $[A,B]$ as , $[A,B] (X_1,..,X_{k+l}) = \frac{1}{(k+l)!} \Sigma _{\sigma \in S_n} (sgn \sigma) [A (X_{\sigma(1)},X_{\sigma(2)},..,X_{\sigma(k)}) , B (X_{\sigma(k+1)},X_{\sigma(k+2)},..,X_{\sigma(k+l)})]$ This means that if say $k=1$ then $[A,A] (X,Y) = [A(X),A(Y)]$ and $[A,A] = 2A \wedge A$.
The Cartan structure equation states that, $d\Omega = \Omega \wedge \omega - \omega \wedge \Omega$. But some people write this as, $d\Omega = [\Omega,\omega]$. This is not clear to me. Because if the above were to be taken as a definition of the $[,]$ then clearly $[A,A]=0$ contradicting what was earlier derived.",['differential-geometry']

The transitivity of the group implies that there is only $1$ orbit. Burnside's lemma then implies that the average number of fixed points for an element in the group is $1$. Since the identity fixes everything, there is a fixed point free element. I can show that there exists an element of order $p$:
Again we use that the group is transitive and that there is therefore only one orbit. Since there is only one orbit, the order of the orbit of $x$ is $p^k$. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the order of the stabilizer of some element $x$ is equal to the order of the group divided by $p^k$. Since the order of a stabilizer is an integer, $p^k$ divides the order of the group. By Cauchy's theorem, there is an element of order $p$ in the group.

Ideally, I would also like to have some measure of the goodness of the fit and the degree of variation within the parameters. As a materials physicist, I often have to create a simple quantum mechanical model from either experimental data or a more complex calculation.  For the smaller problems (8x8, with 10 params), the parameters can be found by painstakingly working through the various relationships among the parameters, due to symmetry, etc.  But, this method is specific to each problem and does not scale well to larger problems.  For instance, one system I'm looking at would require a 20x20 matrix with 21 parameters, and that is without including spin!  Alternatively, there is the brute force method of simulated annealing, which involves taking a random walk through the parameter space, and slowly decreasing the step size in the hopes that the calculation will get stuck in the global minimum.  Neither of these methods is particularly appealing, so I'd like some ideas on how to approach this in a consistent manner.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'physics']"

In other words, is it really impossible to define integration on nonorientable manifolds using forms alone? I am of course aware that any $n$-form must vanish somewhere on a nonorientable manifold, so we cannot find a volume form, hence cannot use the standard definition of integration.  I think the reason I'm not finding this answer satisfying is that it is a bit tautological: we can't define integration with respect to volume forms because there are no volume forms. But why must we define integration with respect to a (global) volume form in the first place? Is there really no other way to do it using locally-defined forms?

- it's a constant I'm inclined to call ""natural chance of success"". I have estimated this value to be ~0.632121 but would very much like to see how it could be calculated aside from the brute-force method i employed earlier. The background of this would be... consider n = 2 (a coin). You are given two flips of the coin to get what you pick - what is the chance you'll get your chosen outcome, assuming of course it's a fair coin. The best way to go about this would be to say there's a 1/2 chance of failing, and you have 2 flips. This means you have $(1/2)^2$ chance of failure, being 1/4. 1-1/4 is 3/4, so your chance of success here is 3/4. Now consider n = 6 (standard die). You get six rolls to get the number of your choice (assuming a fair die again). Again, you have a 5/6 chance to not get your choice, and 6 rolls at 5/6 chance would be $(5/6)^6$, or ~.334, giving you a ~.665 chance of success. And I'm curious as n increases to infinity, what is your chance of success? Now again, I've estimated this with a double precision float (in Java) to be 0.63212 (actually, this was the point at which it could simply gain no more precision on the value, n = 296536) but this doesn't really give insight to the derivation of the number, merely its value.
