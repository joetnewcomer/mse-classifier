2154574,Getting complex solutions with MATLAB's ode45,"I'm trying to solve the ODE below using Matlab's ode45 : $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\sqrt{A\cdot \sin(y) + B\cdot \cos(y)}$$ where $0\le x \le 1$. The Matlab code is: A = -2.45;

The solution seems fine for most values of $x$, but for the last few points close to $x=1$ I get complex $y$ with very small imaginary parts.

From this, the equation of altitude from intesection of lines $y - \alpha x = 0$ and $lx + my - 1 =0$ can be computed. I did the labour and got $$\beta \gamma y + \gamma x - (\alpha\beta + 1) = 0\tag 2$$

$$ The bounty on this question is really for this one calculation, and the original question below is just for some (historical) context. Let $X$ be a complex $n$ -manifold with a rank- $r$ vector bundle $E$ and open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ such that $E|_{U_\alpha}\cong\mathbb{C}^r$ . Say we have two $r\times r$ -matrices $P,Q$ of differential $1$ -forms, i.e. $P\in\Omega^1_{U_\alpha}\otimes\operatorname{End}(E|_{U_\alpha})$ ; $Q\in\Omega^1_{U_\beta}\otimes\operatorname{End}(E|_{U_\beta})$ . Question 1: What is the wedge product $P\wedge Q$ ? I believe it should just be matrix multiplication, but using the wedge product component-wise, i.e. $$(P\wedge Q)_{ij}=\sum_{k}(P_{ik}\wedge Q_{kj})$$ but (having read the article on vector-valued differential forms on the infallible Wikipedia) we should have that $$P\wedge Q\in\Omega^2_{U_{\alpha\beta}}\otimes\operatorname{End}(E|_{U_\alpha})\otimes \operatorname{End}(E|_{U_\beta}).$$ Then, using the fact that the $E|_{U_\alpha}$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces, we see that $P\wedge Q$ should be an $r^2\times r^2$ -matrix of differential $2$ -forms (since $\operatorname{End}(V)\otimes\operatorname{End}(W)\cong\operatorname{End}(V\otimes W)$ for f.d. vector spaces). In this case, the wedge product should be given by something like the Kronecker product of $P$ and $Q$ . Question 2: Now let $M$ be an $r\times r$ matrix of holomorphic functions (i.e. $0$ -forms). What can we say about $P\wedge MQ$ ? It seems clear that we should always have $(MP)\wedge Q=M(P\wedge Q)$ ; $P\wedge MQ=PM\wedge Q$ ; $P\wedge Q=-(Q^t\wedge P^t)^t$ (or something similar, depending on the answer to Question 1). However, using these two 'facts' it doesn't seem possible to 'pull out the $M$ ' from an expression of the form $P\wedge MQ$ . Is there a way of doing so? Matrix non-commutativity gets in the way here, but are there restrictions we can place on $M$ , $P$ , or $Q$ to get some nice result?","['matrices', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

2154974,Bounding angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides,"Is it true that angles in Riemannian triangles with bounded sides are uniformly bounded? More precisely, let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. Given $0<r <s$, is there a number $\delta$ (depending on $M,r,s$), such that for every triangle in $M$  (composed of geodesic edges), with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, its angles are greater than $\delta$? Do we need compactness of $M$ for that to hold? Or are curvature bounds suffice? Edit: The statement is false if we allow arbitrary pairs of $(r,s),0<r<s$. In fact, if we allow $2r \le s$, then one can always take a degenerate triangle whose edge lengths are $r,r,2r$ and then two angles will be zero! Thus, there are to ways to proceed towards a correct version: Proposition (1): Let $M$ be compact, $0<r<s, 2r > s$. Then, there exist a number $\delta=\delta(M,r,s)$, such that for every triangle in $M$ with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, all its angles are greater than $\delta$. Proposition (2): Let $M$ be compact, $0<r<s$. Then, there exist a number $\delta=\delta(M,r,s)$, such that for every triangle in $M$ with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, at least one angle is greater than $\delta$. Below I give proofs for the two propositions stated above. Open questions: Do the propositions hold if we only assume lower bound the curvature, without compactnes? Is there a way to get an effective bound $\delta$ as a function of $r,s$ (depending also in $M$ somehow)? 
What if we assume some bounds on the curvature? (The above discussion on degenerate triangles implies that in Proposition (1), we should expect $\delta(r,s)$ to tend to zero, when $s \to 2r$). Proof of Proposition (1): Suppose by contradiction there is no bound $\delta$. Then, there exist triangles $\Delta_n=\{[a_n,b_n],[b_n,c_n],[c_n,a_n]\}$ (where $[a_n,b_n]$ is a minimizing geodsic of unit speed connecting $a_n,b_n$ etc) with edge lengths in $[r,s]$, and each $\Delta_n$ has an angle $\theta_n$ which tends to zero when $n \to \infty$. By passing to a subsequence (or relabeling the vertices) we can assume $\theta_n=\angle b_n a_n c_n$. Using the Arzela-Ascoli theorem (and perhaps again passing to a subsequence) we can assume that $[a_n,b_n] \to [a,b], [b_n,c_n] \to [b,c],[c_n,a_n] \to [c,a]$, when the convergence is uniform ($[a,b],[b,c],[c,a]$ are paths connecting the corresponding limit points). By our assumption, $$d(a_n,b_n)=L([a_n,b_n]),$$ hence by the continuity of the distance function, and lower semi-continuity of length (w.r.t uniform convergence), we get that $$ L([a,b]) \le \lim_{n \to \infty} L([a_n,b_n])=\lim_{n \to \infty} d(a_n,b_n)=d(a,b),$$ hence $[a,b]$ is a shortest path connecting $a,b$ and similar statements hold for $[b,c],[c,a]$. Observation (1): Continuity of the distance imlies $d(a,b),d(b,c),d(c,a)$ all lie in $[r,s]$. Now, since angles in Riemannian manifolds are lower semi-continuous* , $$ \angle b a c \le \liminf \angle b_n a_n c_n =0,$$ so $\angle b a c=0$ Hence, $b,c$ lie on the same geodesic emanating from $a$. W.L.O.G we assume $b$ lies on that geodesic between $a,c$. But then $$ s \ge d(a,c)=d(a,b)+d(b,c)\ge 2r,$$ which contradicts the assumption. (we have used observation (1) above). Proof of Proposition (2): The proof is very similar to the proof of proposition (1), so we only give a sketch: Assume the claim is false. Then there exist suitable triangles $\Delta_n$, whose all angles are not greater than $\frac{1}{n}$. Thus, following the proof above, we conclude there is a ""limit triangle"" with all angles zero, which is a contradiction. *Remrak on semi-continuity of angles: By theorem 4.3.11 in ""A course in metric geometry"" (by Burago,Burago,Ivanov), if the curvature of $M$ is nonnegative then angles in $M$ are lower semi-continuous. The assumption of nonnegative curvature can probably be omitted. The lower semi-continuity of angles which seems to hold in any intrinsic space of bounded curvature (see details in HK Lee's answer ); Locally, every Riemannian manifold has bounded curvature, and since angles are ""local"" objects (we can restrict our attention to the a neighbourhood of the corresponding vertex) the conclusion follows.","['angle', 'riemannian-geometry', 'triangles', 'geometry']"
2154983,"Likelihood Ratio Test: Uniform Distribution, Change of Inequality in Alternative Hypothesis","Thanks, in advance. I would really appreciate any help here. Problem:  Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be a random sample from a $\operatorname{Uniform}(0,\theta)$ population.  Let $$H_0 : \theta = \theta_0 \quad \text{and} \quad H_A : \theta < \theta_0.$$  The unrestricted MLE of $\theta$ is $X_{(n)}$ (the maximum). (a) Show that for a likelihood ratio test of size $\alpha$ that the rejection region is $$\frac{X_{(n)}}{\theta_0} < \alpha^{1/n}.$$ Solution :  This question I was able to do.  We know that the rejection region for any GLRT is of the form $$RR = \{\Lambda(X_1, \ldots, X_n) < c\}.$$  So, $$\begin{align*}
\Pr[\text{reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ true}] &= \Pr[\Lambda(X_1, \ldots, X_n) < c \mid \theta = \theta_0] \\
&= \Pr[(X_{(n)}/\theta_0)^n < c \mid \theta = \theta_0 ] \\
&= \Pr[X_{(n)} < c^{1/n} \theta_0 \mid \theta = \theta_0 ] \\
&= \Pr[X_1 < c^{1/n} \theta_0 \mid \theta = \theta_0]^n \\
&= \biggl( \int_{x=0}^{c^{1/n} \theta_0} \frac{1}{\theta_0} \, dx \biggr)^{\! n} \\
&= (c^{1/n})^n = c \\
&= \alpha \end{align*}$$ Thus, $$RR = \{\Lambda(X_1, \ldots, X_n) < c\} = \left\{ \left(\frac{X_{(n)}}{\theta_0}\right)^{\! n} < \alpha \right\} = \left\{ \frac{X_{(n)}}{\theta_0} < \alpha^{1/n} \right\}.$$ (b) Now, let $$H_0 : \theta = \theta_0 \quad \text{and} \quad H_A : \theta > \theta_0.$$  Show that the LRT is simple in the sense that if $X_{(n)} < \theta_0$ we accept $H_0$ and if $X_{(n)} > \theta_0$ we reject $H_0$ for all $\alpha$. Attempt at this question :  So in this case would the rejection region of the LRT switch to this:  $$RR = \{ \Lambda(X_1, \ldots, X_n) > c \}?$$  My reasoning is that if $\Lambda(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = (X_{(n)}/\theta_0)^n$, then $H_A$ implies that $\theta > \theta_0 = X_{(n)} > \theta_0$ and so we would expect $(X_{(n)}/\theta_0)^n$ to be a number larger than one if $H_A$ is true.  And so, doing the same process as (a) for all $\alpha$ it would follow that if $X_{(n)}/\theta_0 > 1$ (as long as $X_{(n)} > \theta_0$) then we would always reject for all $\alpha$ since we end up with $(X_{(n)}/\theta_0)^n > \alpha \rightarrow X_{(n)}/\theta_0 > \alpha^{1/n}$ and $0 < \alpha \le 1$.  Of course, the bound could be lower for different $\alpha$ that aren't one, but $X_{(n)}/\theta_0 > 1$ will always be a stronger condition. Basically, this whole idea revolves around the RR being different from what I am used to seeing.  What is wrong with my reasoning? EDIT: I believe I have figured out this problem. Here was my solution in case anyone cares: Since $\Lambda_r = (\frac {X_{(n)}}{\theta_0})^n$ , we know that if $H_A : \theta > \theta_0$ then this implies that $H_A : X_{(n)} > \theta_0$. So, we want to find c such that again, $Pr[reject \ H_0 | H_0 \ is \ true]
=Pr[\Lambda_r < c \ \ | \theta = \theta_0]$=$Pr[\ (\frac {X_{(n)}}{\theta_0})^n < c \ \ | \ \ \theta = \theta_0] = \alpha$. If indeed $H_A : X_{(n)} > \theta_0$ is true then this would imply (as I originally stated) that $\Lambda_r > 1$. In other words, 
$RR = \{ \Lambda_r > 1\} $. However, if $X  \sim Uniform(0, \theta)$ distributed random variable then under $H_0$ it is impossible for the maximum $X_{(n)}$ to be greater than $\theta_0$ and so it is impossible for $\Lambda_r > 1$, since under the null $X  \sim Uniform(0, \theta_0)$ and thus $Pr[ X_{(n)} > \theta_0 | \theta = \theta_0] = 0 $ . Thus, $Pr[reject \ H_0 | H_0 \ is \ true] = Pr[\ \Lambda_r > 1\ | \theta = \theta_0] = Pr[X_{(n)} > \theta_0 | \theta = \theta_0] =  0.$ Thus, it follows that if we observe a maximum value that is greater than $\theta_0$ that the null hypothesis cannot be true (ie. the alternative hypothesis must be true), since under the null hypothesis the probability of observing a maximum value greater than $\theta_0$ is zero, regardless of $\alpha$.","['statistics', 'probability', 'hypothesis-testing']"

Here is the problem. It will cost time to form this matrix to see if there will be lines with zeroes only. For this I can use Gaussian Elimination .

2155126,Cohen-Macaulay and connected implies equidimensional?,"I'm asking for a reality check. It seems to me that since Cohen-Macaulay rings are locally equidimensional, such a ring is either equidimensional or else disconnected (with different dimensions occurring on different connected components). But I have not slept enough, so I don't trust my reasoning. Is it sound? Addendum: Having given this more (and better-slept) thought, it is not at all clear to me. I know that a local Cohen-Macaulay ring is equidimensional, in other words, all minimal primes have the same dimension. (E.g. Eisenbud, Commutative Algebra with a View Toward Algebraic Geometry , Corollary 18.11.) ( Edit 2/24/17: The following proof is flawed. See second addendum.) It follows from this that for an arbitrary (noetherian) Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$, if $\operatorname{Spec} R$ is connected, then all the minimal primes $\mathfrak{p}$ have the same dimension. I.e. $\dim R/\mathfrak{p}$ does not depend on $\mathfrak{p}$. Proof: two minimal primes of differing dimension cannot be contained in the same maximal, by localizing at that maximal and applying the result for local rings. Therefore, sort the minimal primes according to dimension. There are only finitely many minimal primes, so finitely many classes containing finitely many primes each, and one can build a partition of $\operatorname{Spec} R$ into finitely many disjoint closed sets corresponding to the classes in this way. Connectedness implies there is only one class, thus all minimal primes have the same dimension. Geometrically, this is the statement that the irreducible components of $R$ are all the same dimension. But I thought equidimensionality also meant that the maximals all have the same height. Here, I don't see the argument. Imagine one maximal that covers all the minimals with height $1$, say, and another maximal that lies above all the minimals with height $2$, with a lot of height 1 primes in between. This yields a connected $\operatorname{Spec}$ since a single closed set containing all the minimal primes will be everything, but if two different closed sets each contain a minimal prime, then they overlap at the maximals. This scenario is not ruled out by any property I can think of possessed by the poset of primes of a Cohen-Macaulay ring: it is catenary (since it is a ranked poset, ranked by height); the minimals are all dimension 2; etc. But yet I see numerous references on the internet to the notion that Cohen-Macaulay rings are equidimensional (sometimes without even a connected assumption, which can't be right; e.g. $k\times k[x]$ is Cohen-Macaulay). E.g. here . Perhaps they mean the local case? Or are using a weaker notion of equidimensionality? Second addendum, 2/24/17: I am no longer convinced by the above argument that the minimal primes in a Cohen-Macaulay ring with a connected spectrum must have the same dimension. It is the case that the minimal primes under a given maximal have the same-length saturated chains to that maximal , but it doesn't follow that they have the same dimension: perhaps one of them is also under another maximal with a greater height, while the other is not. On the other hand: if the Cohen-Macaulay ring with the connected spectrum happens to be integral over an equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring (which is guaranteed, e.g. for finite-type $k$-algebras by Noether normalization, per conv. with MooS below her/his answer), then I have convinced myself it is equidimensional. Here is why I think so: Let the Cohen-Macaulay ring be $R$ and let the equidimensional Cohen-Macaulay subring be $S$; say its dimension is $d$. Since $S$ is Cohen-Macaulay, the result quoted above for local rings, together with the fact that Cohen-Macaulay rings are catenary, implies that the lengths of any two saturated chains of primes from a given maximal to two minimals under it are equal. Since $S$ is equidimensional, this common length must be $d$ for every maximal. Thus, the length of any saturated chain between any minimal prime and any maximal is $d$. It follows from a second application of catenaryness that for any prime ideal of $S$, and any saturated chain from a minimal to a maximal containing this prime, the position of this prime in this chain depends only on the prime and not on the chain. Now consider any saturated chain of primes between a minimal prime $\mathfrak{p}$ and a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ in $R$. Say its length is $\ell$. Intersecting with $S$, one obtains a chain of primes, and due to integrality, it has the following three properties: (1) it is saturated; (2) its ""top end"" is a maximal; (3) it is length $\ell$. (1) and (2) are due to going-up and (3) is due to incomparability . ( Edit 2/24/17: I'm no loger convinced going-up implies (1). Grr! See third addendum.) Let the $h(\mathfrak{p})$ be the height of $\mathfrak{p}\cap S$ in $S$. By the above discussion, $h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$; thus $\ell$ doesn't depend on $\mathfrak{m}$ or the choice of chain, but only on $\mathfrak{p}$. Connectedness of the spectrum (at least for noetherian rings) is equivalent to connectedness of the bipartite graph with vertex classes the minimal and maximal primes, and edges indicating containment. (Proof: two closed sets $V(\mathfrak{p}), V(\mathfrak{q})$ of the spectrum, where $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$ are minimal primes, meet iff there is a maximal containing both $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$. So if the graph is disconnected, there is a partition of these finitely many closed sets $V(\text{minimal prime})$, which cover the spectrum, into disjoint classes, and this disconnects the spectrum. Conversely, if the spectrum is disconnected, there are two disjoint nonempty closed sets; they must both meet the minimal primes and contain everything above the ones they meet, and then the way they partition the minimal primes also partitions the graph.) Thus, between any two minimal primes $\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{q}$, there is a path in the graph $$\mathfrak{p} = \mathfrak{p}_1 \subset \mathfrak{m}_1\supset \mathfrak{p}_2\subset \mathfrak{m}_2\supset \dots\subset\mathfrak{m}_r\supset \mathfrak{p}_{r+1} = \mathfrak{q}$$ Because $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay, by the same logic as for $S$ above (i.e. by localizing at $\mathfrak{m}_i$) we conclude that the lengths $\ell_i$ and $\ell_i'$ of saturated chains between $\mathfrak{m}_i$, and $\mathfrak{p}_i$ and $\mathfrak{p}_{i+1}$ respectively, are equal, for each $i$. Thus $h(\mathfrak{p}_i)$ and $h(\mathfrak{p}_{i+1})$ are equal. And thus $h(\mathfrak{p})$ and $h(\mathfrak{q})$ are equal. Thus $h$ is a constant function on the minimal primes of $R$. Now take any minimal prime of $S$. By lying-over, there is some prime of $R$, say $\mathfrak{p}^*$, lying over it, which must be minimal by incomparability, and we have $h(\mathfrak{p}^*)=0$. Therefore, $h$ is identically zero on the minimal primes of $R$. Thus for any saturated chain in $R$ from a minimal $\mathfrak{p}$ to a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$, of length $\ell$, we have $0=h(\mathfrak{p}) = d - \ell$, and we conclude $\ell=d$. Therefore, all maximals have height $d$ and all minimals have dimension $d$, i.e. $R$ is equidimensional of dimension $d$. Third addendum, 2/24/17: There is a soft spot in the proof of the second addendum as well. I found another unjustified assumption I made probably due to being overly familiar with the good behavior of the coordinate rings of varieties. Going-up doesn't imply by itself that the intersection of a saturated chain in $R$ with $S$ yields a saturated chain in $S$, although it may well be true in the present context for other reasons. I asked a followup question on this point here . Fourth addendum, 2/26/17: Given the track record at this point, there's no reason to expect me not to find another mistake; however, I believe I have proven this variant of the statement in the second addendum: If a Cohen-Macaulay ring has a connected spectrum and is finite (strengthened from integral) over a subring that is an integrally closed, equidimensional, catenary noetherian domain, then it is equidimensional. This OP is already too long without me adding another detailed proof, but it very loosely follows the pattern of the argument in the 2nd addendum, i.e. argues that all maximal chains in $S$ have length $d$ and then shows $h(\mathfrak{p})=0$ using connectedness. Here is a reasonably complete outline: I. Show all maximal chains in $S$ have the same length $d$ using equidimensionality + catenariness. II. Consider the set $W_0$ of primes of $R$ whose intersection with $S$ is zero. (a) They are all minimal and dimension $d$. (b) Fixing one of them $\mathfrak{p}$, and a target maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ containing it, construct a chain of length $d$ to $\mathfrak{m}$ by (b1) passing temporarily to $R/\mathfrak{p}$ which is a domain containing $S$; then passing to their fraction fields; then forming normal closure of $\operatorname{Frac}(R/\mathfrak{p}) /\operatorname{Frac}S$ and taking $S$'s integral closure $B$ in it; (b2) invoking going-up to construct a chain of length $d$ in $B$ with top term lying over $\mathfrak{m}\cap S$, and and lying-over to find another prime in $B$ lying over $\mathfrak{m}$; (b3) using a Galois automorphism to move the chain til its top term is the prime we found lying over $\mathfrak{m}$; (b4) intersecting with $R$ yielding the desired chain. (c) By Cohen-Macaulayness, a maximal $\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$ that contains one of the $\mathfrak{p}$'s in $W_0$ (and is therefore height $d$) can't also contain a minimal prime $\mathfrak{q}$ with $h(\mathfrak{q}) >0$. Thus if there are any such minimal primes, the graph described in the 2nd addendum is disconnected. This contradicts the fact that the spectrum of $R$ is connected, so there are no such primes. Therefore all minimals are in $W_0$, so are dimension $d$ by (a), and all maximals contain one of these, so are height $d$ by (b). Conclude equidimensionality. Fifth addendum, 3/13/17: Fourth addendum holds up I believe, but argument in (b) can be simplified by replacing the Galois theory just by passing to $R/\mathfrak{p}$ and then invoking the going-down theorem for $S\subset R/\mathfrak{p}$.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'cohen-macaulay', 'commutative-algebra']"

Show that there is an unique operation on $X$ so that $X$ is a group and $f$ is an isomorphism. My attempt: Define an operation $*$ on $X$ such that $f(a \ \cdot \ b) = f(a) * f(b)$ for an arbitrary $a, b \in G$, so $f(a), \ f(b), \ f(a) * f(b) \in X$, because $a, b \in G$ are arbitrary and $f$ is a bijection, so $*$ is an binary operation on $X$. We show now that $(X, *)$ is a group. In fact, $\bullet \ f(e)$ is the neutral element of $(X,*)$, because $f(e) * f(a) = f(e \ \cdot \ a) = f(a) = f(a \ \cdot \ e) = f(a) * f(e)$, where $e$ is the neutral element of $(G, \cdot)$ and $a$ is an arbitrary element of $(G,\cdot)$. $\bullet$ $f(a^{-1})$ is the inverse element of $f(a)$ in $(X,*)$, because $f(a^{-1}) * f(a) = f(a^{-1} \ \cdot \ a) = f(e) = f(a \ \cdot \ a^{-1}) = f(a) * f(a^{-1})$ Therefore $(X,*)$ is a group and $f: G \longrightarrow X$ is an isomorphism by the way it was defined. We show now the oneness of operation $*$. Suppose there are two operations $*$ and $\circledast$ on $X$ such that $(X,*)$, $(X,\circledast)$ are groups and $f: (G, \cdot) \longrightarrow (X,*)$, $f: (G, \cdot) \longrightarrow (X,\circledast)$ are isomorphisms, so $id_X: (X,*) \longrightarrow (X,\circledast)$ is an isomorphism.

2155285,Show that a set is finite if and only if every linear ordering on it is a well-ordering,"Show that a set is finite if and only if every linear ordering on it is a well-ordering What i have done so far: $\Rightarrow$: Let $(X,\prec)$, where X is finite and $\prec$ is linear ordering. Consider a subset $A\subset X$. Since $X$ is finite, $A$ is also finite. Hence, there exists some $f:I(x)\rightarrow A$ bijective, where $I(x)$ is a finite subset of the natural numbers. We redefine $f$ in a such way that it is an increasing function. Given $a,b\in A$, we have that $f(m)=a$ and $f(n)=b$, for some $m,n\in I(x)$. Since $\prec$ is linear ordering we have that $a\prec b$ or $b\prec a$. Considering the firt case $a\prec b$ (ie, $f(m)\prec f(n)$), we redefine $f$ only if $n<m$, and put $f(m)=b$ and $f(n)=a$. Similarly we redefine $f$ for $b\prec a$. Doing this process for all pairs $a,b\in A$, we ensure that $f$ is increasing and, recalling that every subset of the natural numbers has a minmal ement, we have that $A$ also has a minimal element. Since $A$ was arbitrary, this proves that $\prec$ is well-ordering. That's what i could do. Is it correct? Any hints on the $\Leftarrow$ part?","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2155293,Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$ genus of a Torus?,"So I'm attempting to compute the $\chi_{y}$ genus of a one-dimensional torus.  Even though I know it's certainly not zero, there are two reasons why I convinced myself it was; one of them probably very basic, the other to do with Atiyah-Bott localization. Before getting there, let $X$ be a compact, complex manifold with formal Chern roots $x_{i}$.  The Hirzebruch $\chi_{y}$ genus is given by $$\chi_{y}(X) = \int_{X} \prod_{i} (1+ye^{-x_{i}}) \frac{x_{i}}{1-e^{-x_{i}}}$$ Now, for a one-dimensional torus, there is only one factor in that product.  Moreover, its Chern root is zero since the tangent bundle is trivial.  However, one cannot naively set $x=0$, since you end up with a indeterminate $0/0$ expression.  Rather, I expanded the integrand: $$(1+ye^{-x})\frac{x}{1-e^{-x}}=(y+1) + \frac{1}{2} x (y-1) + \cdots$$ Since the integral is a pairing of homology and cohomology classes, we only get contributions from one of those terms leaving, $$\chi_{y}(X) = \frac{1}{2}(y-1)\int_{X} x $$ If that integral were one , I think that would be the right answer, but why isn't that integral zero!?  That Chern root should be zero, and moreover, the integral of the top Chern class is the Euler characteristic which is zero.  Where exactly am I overlooking something here? Localization Argument: The other reason I convinced myself this should vanish, is that a torus acts freely on itself.  So I thought that by the Atiyah-Bott localization, if there are no fixed points, then the integral simply vanishes.

2155305,Physicist trying to understand GIT quotient,"I am reading Nakajima's textbook on Hilbert Schemes. I am trying to understand some very basic facts about the GIT quotient. We start with a vector space $V$ over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $G \subset U(V)$ be a Lie group and $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ its complexification so I guess $G^{\mathbb{C}} \subset GL_V$. I will denote by $G$ the complexification from now on. Apparently $V/G$ is a very badly behaved space. I do not know really why though. I can imagine that there might be some singularities but can they not be resolved e.g. by blowing up? Also, why sometimes this space is not Hausdorff? Now, let $A(V)$ be the coordinate ring of $V$. Nakajima says something I did not know, that the $A(V)$ is the same as the symmetric power of the dual space $V^*$. 
$$ A(V) = Sym^n(V^*) $$ Why is this true? I have to admit that this seems very basic and I did not know about it. Next I learn that $G$ has a natural action on $V$ i.e. $v \mapsto gv$ for $g \in G$ and $v \in V$. Then, this induces an action on $A(V)$. We define $$ A(V)^G = \{ {\text{polynomials }a | ga =a \text{ for }\forall g\in G }  \}$$
the ring of invariant (polynomials). Finally we define the algebro-geometric quotient of $V$ by $G$ as
$$  Spec(A(V)^G)=V//G  $$
To me this is the space of prime ideals that are invariant under $G$. But I do not see how exactly this is related to the original space we wanted to construct. It seems quite different actually. Intuitively what is this space $V//G$ and why is it useful? P.S. Nakajima says: The underlying space of $V//G$ is the set of closed $G$-orbits modulo the equivalence relation defined by $x \backsim y$ if some specific condition, that I do not mention here, holds.","['symplectic-geometry', 'geometric-invariant-theory', 'quotient-spaces', 'algebraic-geometry']"

$$a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+......a_2x^2+a_1x=c$$
Let the LHS of this expression be the function $f(x)$. I'm gonna write the Taylor series of $f^{-1}(x)$ around x=0 and then put $x=c$ in it to get $f^{-1}(c)$ which will be the value of $x$. Since, $f^{-1}(0)=0$ here, so we've got the first term of our Taylor series as $0$. Now, the only thing that remains is calculating the derivatives of $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x=0$. I'm using the fact that $$\frac{d(f^{-1}(x))}{dx}=\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$$ By differentiating this equation, we can get the second derivative of f−1(x) as:
$$\frac{d^2(f^{-1}(x))}{dx^2}=-\frac{1}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^2}\cdot f''(f^{-1}(x))\cdot (f^{-1})'(x)$$ Similarly, we can get the other derivatives by further differentiation of this equation. Then we can evaluate all the derivatives at x=0 to get the Taylor series of $f^{-1}(x)$ and evaluate it at $x=c$ to get the value of $x$. I don't know the formula of $f^{-1}(x)$ but I know the value of $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x=0$. After doing all the formulas, what I have to do in the end in evaluating that expression at $x=0$ and I've the value of $f^{-1}(x)$ at $x=0$.
For example, $$f'^{-1}(x)=\frac{d(f^{-1}(x))}{dx}=\frac{1}{f'(f(^{-1}(x))}$$
$$=\frac{1}{n*a_{n}(f(^{-1}(x)))^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}(f(^{-1}(x)))^{n-2}+.............2a_2f^{-1}(x)+a_1}$$
which gives $$\frac{1}{a_1}$$ at $x=0$ since $$f^{-1}(0)=0$$
Similarly,
$$\frac{d^2(f^{-1}(x))}{dx^2}=-\frac{1}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^2}\cdot f''(f^{-1}(x))\cdot (f^{-1})'(x)$$ We already have the value of the first derivative at $x=0$ so we can substitute that here, so
$$\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}(f^{-1}(x))=-\frac{1}{a_1^{2}}\cdot 2a_2\cdot \frac{1}{a_1}$$
$$=-\frac{2a_2}{a_1^{3}}$$

2155691,How to relate the spectrum of a self-adjoint unbounded operator to the spectrum of a compact solution operator,"Apologies if this is a trivial question. I'm having some trouble getting this straight in my head and would appreciate either an explanation or a pointer to a good reference. If this looks too long, here's a tl;dr Say I have a densely defined, bounded below, symmetric operator $T$ defined in a Hilbert space $H$. After shifting by some $\sigma$ one can show there exists a compact solution operator $K$. Why does the spectrum of $T$ coincide with (a shift of) the spectrum of $K$? Setup Let $H$ be a Hilbert space with inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$. Let $T$ be a densely defined symmetric operator bounded below by some constant $c$, with $D = \operatorname{dom}(T)$. Define the form $\mathfrak{t}$ on $D\times D$ by $\mathfrak{t}(u,v) = (Tu,v)$. By symmetry $\mathfrak{t}$ is sesquilinear. Because $T$ is bounded below, if we choose $\sigma > \max\{1,-c\}$, the form defined on $D\times D$ by 
$$ \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(u,v) = \mathfrak{t}(u,v) + \sigma\cdot(u,v) $$
is a positive definite Hermitian inner product on $D$. Define by $V$ the completion of $D$ with respect to $\mathfrak{t}_\sigma$. As $\mathfrak{t}_\sigma$ majorizes the norm on $H$ the injection $D\hookrightarrow H$ extends to a bounded embedding $\iota : V\hookrightarrow H$. Now assume that $V$ compactly embeds in $H$. (Here, if $T$ is not self-adjoint, take the Friedrichs extension.) Define an eigenvalue of $\mathfrak{t}$ to be any $\mu\in\mathbb{C}$ such that there exists some $u\in V$ so for all $v\in V$ we have $\mathfrak{t}(u,v) = \mu(u,v)$. I do not assume eigenvectors of $\mathfrak{t}$ are elements of $D$. By Riesz there exists a solution operator $S_\sigma: V^*\to V$. There is a bounded map $P:H\to V^*$ given by $u\mapsto (v\mapsto (u,v))$. (This is bounded by an application of Cauchy-Schwarz.) Composing these with the compact injection $\iota$ gives a compact map $K = S_\sigma P\iota:V\to V$. Note that $K$ has the property that for any $u\in V$, 
$$ \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(Ku, v) = (u,v). $$ By the spectral theorem for compact operators, the spectrum of $K$ is discrete accumulating only at zero, and all nonzero elements of the spectrum are eigenvalues of finite multiplicity. Suppose $u$ is an eigenvalue of $K$ with eigenvector $\mu$. Then for arbitrary $v\in V$,
\begin{align*}
\mathfrak{t}(u,v) &= \mathfrak{t}_\sigma(u,v) - \sigma(u,v) \\
  &= \frac{1}{\mu}\mathfrak{t}_\sigma(Ku, v) - \sigma(u,v) \\
  &= \bigg(\frac{1}{\mu}-\sigma\bigg)(u,v)
\end{align*}
and so we have that $\frac{1 - \mu\sigma}{\mu}$ is an eigenvalue of $\mathfrak{t}$ with eigenvector $u$. Confusion Does it follow that
  $$ \mbox{spectrum of } T = \bigg\{ \frac{1-\mu\sigma}{\mu}\ \bigg|\ \mu\in\mbox{spectrum of }K - \{0\} \bigg\}? $$ Thoughts I've been worrying at this for a couple of days and trying to prove something like the following: If $\lambda$ is in the resolvent set of $T$, then $\frac{1}{\sigma+\lambda}$ is in the resolvent set of $K$. This would immediately imply what I want modulo showing that that eigenvalues of $\mathfrak{t}$ are contained in the spectrum of $T$. (This is not a concern, see the note below.) Some algebra and head-scratching later, nothing has panned out -- it looks promising, but I haven't found the zinger yet. Maybe more to the point, I don't have enough intuition for where the algebra ought to go. I've started by assuming that $u$ is a $\mu$-eigenvector of $K$ in $H$ (after extending showing $K$ is symmetric and extending $K$ to a map $H\to H$ by density of $V$ and compactness), assuming that $\frac{1}{\lambda + \sigma}$ is in the resolvent set of $T$, and showing that we cannot have $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda + \sigma}$, but this approach doesn't seem to rely on the assumption that the domain of $(T-\lambda)^{-1}$  is all of $H$, nor that it is bounded. I'm aware that this closely follows standard reference materials (Gilbarg-Trudinger Ch 8, Evans ch 6.5). In fact in Evans 6.5, at the end of the proof of Theorem 1, Evans writes, ""But observe as well that for $\eta\neq 0$, we have $Sw = \eta w$ if and only if $Lw = \lambda w$ for $\lambda = \frac{1}{\eta}$."" You might interpret this question as, ""why does the 'only if' follow?"" There are at least two other approaches I'm aware of to showing the spectrum of $T$ is discrete. One uses the Rayleigh quotient, shows there exists a lowest eigenvalue, and proceeds by induction to exhaust $H$ with orthonormal eigenspaces (e.g. Gilbarg-Trudinger, last section of ch 8). The other uses the theory of spectral measures (e.g. ch 13 of Green Rudin). I'd prefer to avoid those approaches if possible because I'd like to understand all three in as much detail as possible, in order to more thoroughly understand how they relate to each other. (My intuition is that the exhaustion proof is related to how this proof would go if one unpacked the spectral theorem for compact operators, while the theory of spectral measures is ""not homotopic,"" as it were, to this proof, but that's not yet clear to me.) Anyway, I'm missing a piece of the puzzle here and I'm not sure where the missing piece fits to look more closely for it. Notes In the context of PDEs I'm happy to assume the facts bolded in the setup: $V$ is related to a Sobolev space $W^{1,1}$ so Rellich-Kondrachov comes into play, and elliptic regularity gives that the eigenvectors of $\mathfrak{t}$ are in fact eigenvectors of $T$.

I tried in the following way.
First to find out a non singular matrix $A,$ clearly any row of $A$ can't be full of $0$ s.
So the first row (say) can be filled up by $(8-1)$ ways.
Once the row is filled up,the next row can't be the same and also can't be full of zeros,so we can fill the next row by $
(8-2)$ ways.
And at last the third row also can't be full of zeros,same as the first row,and same as the second row also.So we have $(8-3)$ choices.
Hence the number of non singular matrices seems to be $7×6×5=210$ .
Am I right? Or there are more non singular matrices ? May be less also.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

The isometries of the regular tetrahedron can be given by permutations of its four vertices.
If we look at the action by $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$

we can interpret it as giving a map $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)\rightarrow S_4$

2155855,Explain approximate lines in graph of this function,"Sorry that this is a long question; the crux of it is that I want to know why lines appear in the graph of the function ($\varphi^\infty(x)$) I've defined. Define $\varphi(x)$ as follows: If the decimal representation of $x\in \mathbb{R}$ is $x=\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n 10^n$ where $a_n\in\{0,1,2,...,9\}$ and $|\{a_n\;|\;n>0\}|$ is finite let: $$\varphi(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n\left(\max{\{a_k\;|\;k\in\mathbb{N}\}}+1\right)^n$$ (i.e. read $x$'s base $10$ expansion as if it is written in base $1+\max{\{a_k\}}$). Then let $\varphi^\infty(x)$ be the value obtained by repeated applications of $\varphi(x)$ until a stable value is reached (if it exists), i.e. $\varphi^\infty(x)=\varphi(\varphi(...(\varphi(x))...))$. To illustrate, $\varphi(57)=57_8=47_{10}$, so $\varphi(57)=47$, and $\varphi(47)=47_8=39_{10}$ so $\varphi(47)=39$, and $\varphi(39)=39_{10}$, so no further applications of $\varphi(x)$ will change it, so $\varphi^\infty(57)=39$. Similarly $\varphi(\frac{1}{3})=0.333..._4=1$ and $\varphi(1)=1$ so $\varphi^\infty(\frac{1}{3})=1$. For any number $y$ with $9$ in its decimal expansion we will obviously have $\varphi(y)=\varphi^\infty(y)=y$; $\varphi^\infty(x)$ seems mathematically irrelevant, but it interests me; when graphed for integer $x$, we get linear patterns. Graphs of $\varphi^\infty(x)$ at integer $x$ over increasing domains (full size versions here and here and here and here ): The top line (slope $1$) is numbers containing a $9$; but there are lines of other slopes below (one in red); the following zooms show they are made up of smaller line segments of different slopes. Graphs of $\varphi^\infty(x)$ at integer $x$; the first shows the boxed area above, the second is a zoom for large $x$, and the third is a zoom into one of the line segments in the previous graph (full size versions here and here and here ): $\hskip1.7in$ At the smallest scale line segments with slope $1$ will occur; this can be seen in $\varphi(x)$ which displays the same pattern (I have only focused on $\varphi^\infty(x)$ because the lines are more obvious). Graphs of $\varphi(x)$ at integer $x$ over increasing domains (full size versions here and here and here ): $\hskip1.7in$ I cannot explain why the points (which on the small scale form short lines of slope $1$) on the large scale arrange themselves approximately into lines of varying slopes passing through the origin. Why do the values of $\varphi^\infty(x)$ and $\varphi(x)$ approximately fit onto clear lines like the ones highlighted above? I don't know if similar lines occur for non-integer $x$; points where $\varphi^\infty(x)$ is continuous are obviously dense in $\mathbb{R}$; I can't see a good way of plotting $\varphi(x)$ for real $x$ ($\varphi(\frac{2}{3})=0.666..._7=1$ but a computer might give $\varphi(\frac{2}{3})=0.666...7_8\overset{!}{=}0.857..._{10}$). It exists for all integer $x$, but I can't prove $\varphi^\infty(x)$ exists for all $x$ (for some $x$, we might never get a number with $9$ in the decimal expansion). But my main question is the following: Can anyone explain why the approximations to lines passing through the origin occur in the above graphs? What determines the slope of the lines?

2156257,The Parseval theorem applied to 8 well known functions. Could this be extended to L-series?,"In the shaded section below, I listed 8 well-known functions that nicely hang together: $$\displaystyle\frac{\beta(s)+\lambda(s)}{\kappa(s)+\alpha(s)}=\frac{\zeta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)+\eta_H\left(s,\frac12\right)}{\zeta(s)+\eta(s)}$$ Each of these functions has a Laplace/Fourier integral transform that can be ""plugged into"" the integral from the Parseval theorem : $$\small G_f(s):=\frac{1}{\pi\,\Gamma(s+1)}\int_{0}^{\infty} f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}+x\,i\right)f\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{s+1}{2}-x\,i\right)dx$$ Based on the example for $f(s)=\zeta(s)$ shown here , I managed to derive the new closed forms for each of the 8 functions and also listed them in the shaded area (note: only analytically continued to $\Re(s)>0$). All closed forms $G_f(s)$ are now directly related to $\zeta(s)$ (note that f.i. $\beta(s)$ wasn't). I then found that the same nice relation remains for $s \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\Re(s)>0$, i.e: $$\displaystyle\frac{G{_\beta}(s)+G_{\lambda}(s)}{G_{\kappa}(s)+G_{\alpha}(s)}=\frac{G_{\zeta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)+G{\eta_H}\left(s,\frac12\right)}{G_{\zeta}(s)+G_{\eta}(s)}$$ 1) Is the fact that this relation remains the same a logical consequence of applying the Parseval theorem? (note that other relations like $\zeta(s)+\eta(s)=2\lambda(s)$ or $\alpha(s)+\lambda(s)=\zeta(s)$ do break down). 2) Besides $\zeta(s)$ and sums of $\zeta_H(s)$, the $\lambda$ and the $\beta$-functions are as $L(s,\chi_{4,1})$ and $L(s,\chi_{4,2})$ respectively, the only ones related to a Dirichlet L-series . However, I could not find any further connections like these in the ""G-world"". Do closed forms for L-series (other than mod 4) also exist after applying the Parseval theorem? Addition to question 2: I believe that I have now also found a closed ""G""-form for the Dirichlet L-series . With $\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)$ being a Dirichlet character with modulus $k$ and index $j$, it is well known that: $$\displaystyle L(s,\,\chi_{_{k,\,j}})=\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^k \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)$$ Then I defined: $$\zeta_H^*(s,a)= \zeta_H(s,2a)-(2a-1)\,\zeta_H(s+1,2a)$$
and found that: $$\displaystyle G_{L(s,\,\chi_{{k,\,j}})}=\frac{1}{k^{s+1}}\left(\sum_{n=1}^{k} \chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)^2\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n}{k}\right)+2\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=n+1}^{k-1}\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(n)\cdot\chi_{_{k,\,j}}(m)\cdot\zeta_H^* \left(s,\frac{n+m}{2k}\right)\right)$$ that seems valid for $\Re(s)>-1$, except for index $j=1$, when it is valid for $\Re(s)>1$ only. The latter can be analytically continued to f.i. $0 <  \Re(s) <1$ by just subtracting from the above: $$\displaystyle \small \frac{2}{s\,k}\,\left(L(s,\,\chi_{{k,1}})+\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{n=1}^{k-2}\sum_{m=1}^{k-n-1}\chi_{_{k,1}}(m)\cdot\chi_{_{k,1}}(m+n)\cdot\left(\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m}{k}\right)+\zeta_H \left(s,\frac{m+n}{k}\right)\right)\right)$$ $\\$

2156457,What space corresponds to the localisation of the ring of continuous functions?,"Suppose $A$ is a commutative Banach algebra. By Gelfand duality there is a compactum $X$ such that $A = C(X)$ is the ring of continuous functions. The space $X$ can be recovered as the space of characters on $A$. That is to say multiplicative linear functionals $A \to \mathbb R$ under the weak$^*$ topology. Observe this topology on the space of characters does not depend on the topology of $A$. Now let $f \in C(X)$ be any non-invertible element. In other words $f$ has a zero. We can localise the ring $C(X)$ at $f$ to get the ring of 'formal fractions' $C(X)_f = \displaystyle  \{\frac{g}{f^n} \colon g \in C(X), n \in \mathbb N\}$.

By this I mean a norm under which it is complete and the embedding is an isometry. Nevertheless we can consider the space of characters on $C(X)_f$ and give that the weak$^*$ topology.

Find the probability that exactly one king, exactly one queen and exactly one jack appear (in any order) before the ace first. Please review my methods and answers: One: Find the probability that no kings, queens or jacks appear before the first ace. Notation: Let b cards precede the first ace Let A be the first Ace Let a cards follow the first ace Conditions: b will range from 0 to 36 ($52 - (12 + 4)$) A will be one of four Ace cards a will range from 51 to 15 ($12 + 3$) In order to maintain equal likeliness of all configurations (an assumption), we will find the number of valid permutations and divide by the total number of permutations which will result in the probability of a valid configuration, denoted P(A). $$ P(A) = \frac{\textrm{number of valid permutations}}{\textrm{number of all permutations}} $$ $$P(A) = \frac{1}{52!}\sum_{i=0}^{36}\left(\frac{36!}{(36-i)!}\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}(51-i)!\right) $$
where within the summation, the first expression selects and permutes the number of cards preceding the first ace, the second expression selects the first ace, the third expression selects and permutes the cards which follow the first ace. The expression reduces to:
$$ P(A)=\frac{4\times36!}{52!}\sum_{i=0}^{36} \frac{(51-i)!}{(36-i)!}$$
$$P(A) = 0.25$$ Two: Find the probability that exactly one king, exactly one queen and exactly one jack appear (in any order) before the ace first. There are $\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}$ ways to select one of four elements, be it an ace, jack, queen or king. Proceed in a similar fashion to part 1. by finding the quotient of the total number of permissible permutations and the total number of permutations, labelling it $P(B)$. $$P(B) = \frac{1}{52!} \sum_{i=0}^{36}\left(\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}\frac{1}{3!}\times\frac{36!}{(36-i)!}\frac{4!}{(4-1)!}(48-i)!
\right)$$
Where the first three expressions in the summation are the selection of a king, queen and jack, the fourth expression allows these three cards to be chosen in any order.  The expressions following the multiplication symbol are: selection of a number of cards ( two, three, ... , ten) to follow the face cards and precede the first ace. selection of the first ace selection of the remaining cards The expression collapses to:

Again, as far as I know only hexagonal lattice fits these properties. And I suppose an 1D lattice with equal segments, but this is a trivial case. Square lattice ($d=2$) or cubic lattice ($d=3$) or any generalization for larger $d$ don't work, because there are ways to leave the cell without going through one of its closest neighbors first.

Show that $E$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{Q}$, but that $E$ is not compact.  Is $E$ open? My attempt: By definition $E$ is closed if every limit point of $E$ is an element of $E$. Thus, we want to show that if a point $p$ is a limit point of $E$, $p \in E$, that is $2<p^2<3$. To do this, let $p$ be a limit point of $E$. We then know that $$\forall r> 0, \exists q :d(p,q) < r$$ In other words $$ \forall r> 0, \exists q : q-r < p < q + r$$ Now squaring the inequality gives $$ q^2-2qr + r^2 < p^2 < q^2 + 2qr + r^2 $$ Thus I would like to find an $r$ such that $2<p^2<3$ as desired.  Unfortunately I am having a hard time constructing such an $r$.  Can anyone point me in the right direction? Moreover, I've seen similar problem to this one, in which the set $E$ is proven to be closed by showing that the complement of $E$ is open.  Is this usually the easier route to take?

2156644,There cannot be an infinite AP of perfect squares.,"I could not find any existing questions on this site stating this problem. Therefore I am posting my solution and I ask for other ways to prove this theorem too. The Question Prove that there cannot be an infinite integer arithmetic progression of distinct terms all of which are perfect squares. My attempt We shall prove it using contradiction. First off, there are a couple of things to notice which greatly simplify our discussion: The AP cannot be decreasing as eventually, the terms will be negative and perfect squares are non-negative. There has to be a non-zero, positive difference between the terms otherwise the terms would not be distinct. Let us therefore, assume an AP with the first term $a$ - a non-negative integer and the positive difference $d$. The $i$th term of the AP is $T_i=a+(i-1)d$. The AP is increasing, therefore there is a term $T_n$ for the least value of $n$ such that $T_n\geq d^2$. Now, $T_{n+1}$ is also a perfect square. Let $T_{n+1}=b^2$. Therefore, we have
$$
d^2 \leq b^2 \implies d \leq b 
$$ Therefore we have 
$$
T_{n+1}=b^2+d<b^2+2b+1=(b+1)^2

2156665,How and when to do exercises from books?,"Most math books I have seen seem to be structured in the same way; each chapter is a few dozen pages, and after each chapter there are a few dozen exercises. I often find myself not knowing what exercises to do and when to do them. If I have read the first 10 pages, I'm not sure what $x$ is in ""the first $x$ exercises should be answerable after reading the first $10$ pages."" A prime example is Tristan Needham's ""Visual Complex Analysis"". It's a very good book; however, the first chapter is about $50$ pages long, after which follows a splatter of $50$ exercises. I'm not sure when I should interrupt my reading and go the exercises.

2156761,Help understand the proof of the Multivalued opertor version of the Hille-Yosida Theorem in Ethier-Kurtz,"I am looking at the proof of the following version of the Hille-Yosida theorem given in Ethier and Kurtz' Markov Process. Some Definitions. Here, $A$ is a (multivalued) linear operator on $L$, i.e. a subset $A$ of $L \times L$ with domain $D(A)=\{f:(f,g)\in A \;\text{for some}\;g\}$ and range $R(A)=\{g: (f,g)\in A \; \text{for some}\;f\}$. $A\subset L\times L$ is said to be linear if $A$ is a subspace of $L\times L$. If $A$  is linear, then $A$ is said to be single-valued if $(0,g)\in A$ implies $g=0$, in this case, $A$ is a graph of a linear operator on $L$, also denoted by $A$, so we write $Af=g$ if $(f,g)\in A$. If $A\subset L\times L$ is linear, then $A$ is said to be dissipative if $\Vert \lambda f-g\Vert \ge \lambda \Vert f\Vert $ for all $(f,g)\in A$ and $\lambda >0$; the closure $\bar{A}$ of $A$ is just the closure in $L\times L$ of the subspace $A$. Finally, we define $\lambda - A=\{(f,\lambda f-g):(f,g)\in A\}$ for each $\lambda >0$. Lemma preceding the theorem. Below is the Theorem. Now in the below part of the proof, I don't understand why $\Vert \lambda(\lambda - \bar{A})^{-1}f-f\Vert = \Vert(\lambda - \bar{A})^{-1}g\Vert$ which is above (4.2). Also, why is the domain of $(\lambda - \bar{A})^{-1}$ given as $R(\lambda - A_0)$? Shouldn't it be $R(\lambda-\bar{A})$ by definition? Finally, I don't understand why the range is $D(A_0)$ either. I would greatly appreciate if anyone could explain these to me.","['functional-analysis', 'markov-process', 'semigroup-of-operators', 'analysis']"

I am approaching this problem using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that $\forall a \in \{0, 1, ..., p-1\}$, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$ I try to argue that $a \cdot a^{k(p-1)} \equiv a \mod p$, because $a^{k(p-1)} \mod p$ appears to always be equivalent to $1$ (although I do not have a good justification for this, only experimental data). Then it can be said that $$(a \mod p) \cdot (a^{k(p-1)} \mod p) \equiv (a \mod p) \cdot 1 \equiv a \mod p$$ I then argue that using the numbers we are given, we can say that $x^{p-1} \equiv a^{{(p-1)}^e} \equiv 1 \mod p$, but I don't see how to get back to $a$.","['cryptography', 'modular-arithmetic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2156821,Multiple derivative notation,"Official Leibniz notation for double derivative is: $$\frac{\mathrm d^2s}{\mathrm dt^2}$$ This term seems inconsistent. Two considerations: We have infinitesimal change in distance $\mathrm ds$ per infinitesimal change in time $\mathrm dt$ : $\mathrm ds/\mathrm dt$ . Both terms are a tiny value/interval. Because the $\mathrm d$ symbolizes difference , I would as a change of the change of the distance to time intuitively write: $$\frac{\mathrm d(\mathrm ds/\mathrm dt)}{\mathrm dt}=\frac{(\mathrm ds^2/\mathrm dt^2)}{\mathrm dt}=\frac{\mathrm ds^2}{\mathrm dt^3}$$ where the extra $\mathrm d$ says that both terms are now ""double"" infinitesimal differences. Maybe more properly following mathematical logic and not my intuition, the $\mathrm d$ could be considered a ""free"" variable in itself that can be multiplied onto this $\mathrm ds/\mathrm dt$ fraction numerator: $$\frac{\mathrm d(\mathrm ds/\mathrm dt)}{\mathrm dt}=\frac{(\mathrm d^2s/\mathrm dt)}{\mathrm dt}=\frac{\mathrm d^2 s}{\mathrm dt^2}$$ That agrees with the actual notation but doesn't really make physical sense now. $\mathrm d$ means (infinitesimal) difference, so that $\mathrm ds=s_{final}-s_{start}$ , and therefore it makes no physical sense to consider the $\mathrm d$ and the $s$ separate. The $\mathrm ds$ is physically just a ""name""/""symbol"" for one term, which could just as well have been called $x$ or $a$ or anything else. Now, while searching for an explanation, the answers always tend to consider $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}$ as one symbol in itself, so that a double derivative is $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}s=\frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dt^2}s=\frac{\mathrm d^2s}{\mathrm dt^2}$ - which makes even less physical sense, since the $\mathrm dt$ term has to be a separable term before we can treat $\frac{\mathrm ds}{\mathrm dt}$ as a normal fraction (as done in integration e.g.). $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}$ can't possibly be just ""a symbol"". Why is $\frac{\mathrm d^2s}{\mathrm dt^2}$ the correct one in a physical context, where $\mathrm ds$ actually means the infinitesimal difference in $s$ ? Are my considerations in point 2 correct, and I just can't figure out that splitting $\mathrm d$ and $s$ is allowed? Update The answers already given at this time both indicate the use of $\mathrm d/\mathrm dt$ as merely a symbol. So, neither of my two suggestions mentioned above are the case. Sure, I can accept that. But the question still remains of why as well of how come we still treat them as variables then, e.g. in integration ? Let me clarify those two points: Firstly , if it indeed is the case that $\mathrm d/\mathrm dt$ is merely a symbol and should be thought of as just a symbol, then I do not understand the motivation for this symbol. Why did Leibniz choose $\mathrm d/\mathrm dt$ as a symbol, which causes the confusion and inconsistency described in the question above? Why not, say, $\mathrm d/\mathrm d$ , in which case we would get a writing-style that at least looks a bit more ""consistent"": $$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac st=\frac{\mathrm ds}{\mathrm dt}\qquad \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac st=\frac{\mathrm d^2s}{\mathrm d^2t}\qquad \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d}\frac st=\frac{\mathrm d^3s}{\mathrm d^3t}\qquad \cdots$$ Or even better yet, if the two $\mathrm d$ involved in this $\mathrm d/\mathrm dt$ symbol have no meaning as neither a variable nor an indicator of a change in the parameter, then why use this letter at all? Why not stick to, say, the prime-notation throughout and never jump into the Leibniz notation: $$s_t'\qquad s_t''\qquad s_t'''\qquad \cdots$$ And secondly , if the $\mathrm d/\mathrm dt$ really just is a symbol, and that's it, then how come we suddenly can treat it as a fraction again containing a set of variables $\mathrm ds$ and $\mathrm dt$ that we can split apart during for instance integration? Such as here: $$\frac{\mathrm ds}{\mathrm dt}=v\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \mathrm ds=v\,\mathrm dt\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad \int  1 \,\mathrm ds=\int v\,\mathrm dt \quad\Leftrightarrow\quad s=\int v\,\mathrm dt$$ I hope to get this notion cleared out and appreciate all comments and answers that can help.","['derivatives', 'notation']"

2156863,"How to efficiently use a calculator in a linear algebra exam, if allowed","We are allowed to use a calculator in our linear algebra exam. Luckily, my calculator can also do matrix calculations. Let's say there is a task like this: Calculate the rank of this matrix: $$M =\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 6 & 7\\  12 &4  &9 \\  1 & 7 & 4
\end{pmatrix}$$ The problem with this matrix is we cannot use the trick with multiples, we cannot see multiples on first glance and thus cannot say whether the vectors rows / columns are linearly in/dependent.
Using Gauss is also very time consuming (especially in case we don't get a zero line and keep trying harder). Enough said, I took my calculator because we are allowed to use it and it gives me following results: $$M =\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0{,}3333 & 0{,}75\\  0 &1  &0{,}75 \\  0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}$$ I quickly see that $\text{rank(M)} = 3$ since there is no row full of zeroes. Now my question is, how can I convince the teacher that I calculated it? If the task says ""calculate"" and I just write down the result, I don't think I will get all the points. What would you do?
