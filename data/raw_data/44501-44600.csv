444393,"What is $\int \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} \frac{\delta G}{\delta v} \, dx \; $?","Given $F[u]$ and $G[v]$ are functionals of a real-valued function, what is
$$
  \int \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} \frac{\delta G}{\delta v} \, dx \quad ?
$$ I have encountered such expressions for example in ""Hamiltonian description of the ideal fluid"" by P. J. Morrison. There Poisson brackets for several systems (mostly some version of ideal fluid) are given, like
$$
  \{F, G\} = \int \left[\frac{\delta F}{\delta q} \cdot \frac{\delta G}{\delta \pi} - \frac{\delta G}{\delta q} \cdot \frac{\delta F}{\delta \pi} \right] \, d a^3 \qquad (119)
$$
$$
  \{F, G\} = - \int_D \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \frac{\delta G}{\delta u} \, d x \qquad (156)
$$
and, in general:
$$
  \{F, G\} = \int_D \frac{\delta F}{\delta \psi^i} \mathfrak{J}^{ij} \frac{\delta G}{\delta \psi^j} \, d \mu \qquad (169)
$$
where $F$ and $G$ are functionals of appropriate functions, $\mathfrak{J}$ is a certain operator. Unfortunately it is not said what does it mean, or at least I overlooked it. Moreover, the biggest problem is that even types of expressions involved are not specified. I've tried to filled that gap. Considering functions $u,v : M$ and functionals $F, G : M \to R$, $\; M$ being a manifold of certain kind of functions, functional derivative $D$: $$D : (M \to R) \to M \to M \to R $$
$$ \left( \left(D \, F \right)\, u \right) \, [v] = \left[\frac{d}{d \varepsilon} F[u + \varepsilon v] \right]_{\varepsilon = 0}$$ thus $\delta F / \delta u$ stands likely for $$(D \, F)(u) : M \to R.$$ Now 
$$
  \int_D \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} v \, d x := \left< \frac{\delta F}{\delta u}, v \right> := \left[\frac{d}{d \varepsilon} F[u + \varepsilon v]\right]_{\varepsilon = 0},
$$
that is to some sort of contraction, analogous to covector and vector, and integral notation is just a reference to a finite-dimensional case. Thus I believe $$
  \int_D \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} \frac{\delta G}{\delta v} \, dx := \left[ \frac{\delta F}{\delta u}, \frac{\delta G}{\delta v} \right],
$$
where $[\,,]$ is some sort of scalar product. Indeed, I guess scalar product between functions is implied:
$$
  \left[u. v \right] := \int_D uv \, dx,
$$
but I don't see from
$$\langle \,, \rangle : M \to (M \to R) \to R $$
$$[\,,] : M \to M \to R $$
how $[\,,]$ can be lifted to act for two functional derivatives. That is I know the mapping from functions to functionals, but not vice versa. Probably given enough limitations on $M$ there is one? Maybe someone will point me an accessible, but rigorous introduction to a subject.","['fluid-dynamics', 'classical-mechanics', 'functional-analysis', 'physics']"

Does the Dirichlet density always exist if and only if the lower logarithmic density exists? If both exist, are they equal? Do the above hold in the special case $B=\mathbb{N}$?

444460,IBM Research Ponder This (June Challenge),"This was the challenge in last month's 'IBM Reseach Ponder This'. I just cannot get my head around the solution posted. Can someone explain further? Challenge Find a rational number (a fraction of two integers) that satisfies the following conditions: 1)Its denominator is five digits long and all of them are different. 2)In the infinite decimal representation, every digit occurs an equal number of times in the digits from one billion to two billion places to the right of the decimal point (inclusive), except for the last digit in the denominator, which occurs twice as often as the other nine digits. 3)Its numerator contains as few different digits as possible. Update 6/4: To clarify the problem, here is an example: 5/17 = 0.294117647058823529411764705882... and in the 11 digit in the places 20-30 after the decimal point the digit 7 (the last digit of the demonimator) appears twice as many times as the digit 4, but not twice as many as the digit 9 (which does not appear there at all). Solution The way to have one digit appear twice as many times as the other nine is to set a period of 11 digits. To do that, we need the fraction to be X/99999999999. Factoring the denominator leads us to 21649 as the denominator, and looking at the possible numerators we find that 639/21649 solves the first two conditions. 
To get fewer number of distinct digits, 646/21649 may seem to be the best solution (there are only two different digits), but using improper fractions, we can get the best solution: 333333/21649.","['decimal-expansion', 'number-theory']"
444468,The recursion principle.,"In the book that I read there is a exercise where we need to prove the recursion principle that is written in the next fashion. Proposition : Let $f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function and $c \in \mathbb{N}$. Then, there exist a unique function $ a: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that: $a(0):=c\: $ and  $\:a(n^{+}):=f(n,a(n))$; (where $n^{+}:=n \cup \left\{n \right\} $). The book give us a hint: Show that for each natural number there exist a n-function $ a_{n}: n^{+}\rightarrow \mathbb{N} $ such that $a_{n}(0):=c\: $ and for each $ i \in n$, $\:a_{n}(i^{+}):=f(i,a(i))$. And here is what I have at this moment: Claim 1 : For each natural number there exist a n-function. Proof of Claim 1: Let  ""$\varphi (x)$"" be the following: $ \forall x \forall y \forall y' ( \langle x,y\rangle  \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y'\rangle  \in a_{n} \rightarrow y=y' ) \wedge Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} \wedge a_{n} (0)= c \,\wedge \,  \forall i (i \in n \rightarrow a_{n} (i^{+}) = f(\,i,a_{n} (i))\,). $ Now we can apply the separation axiom and form a set which we define as:
$ S : = \left\{n \in \mathbb{N}: \exists a_{n} \varphi (x) \right\} $ For n=0, we require a function with domain $ 0^{+} $. And as the only element of the domain is $ 0 $, we can form the ordered pair $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\}. $ Which is a function, its domain is in fact $n^{+}$ and the last statement of the formula is vacously true. Then $ 0 \in S$. Suppose $ n\in S $ that means $ a_{n} $ exist. Then, we define  $ a_{n^{+}} $ as follows: $ a_{n^{+}}: = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$. So, only we need to show that  $ a_{n^{+}} $ is a n+1- function. i) $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n^{+}} \leftrightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in  a_{n} \vee  \langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ As $ a_{n}$ is a function by our inductive hypothesis, only we need to show that $ \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} $ is a functional relation: $\langle x,y \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} \rightarrow y = f(n,a_{n} (n) = y'$. It follows because f is indeed a function. ii) $ Dom (a_{n^{+}}) = Dom(a_{n}) \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} $.  By hypothesis we know that $ Dom(a_{n}) = n^{+} $. Hence  $  n^{+} \cup \left\{ n^{+} \right\} = n^{++}$. iii) As $a_{n}\subset a_{n ^ {+}} $, and by hypothesis we know that $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n} $. Then  $\langle 0,c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} $. iv) $\forall i \in n^{+}. \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n ^ {+}} \leftrightarrow \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} \vee \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}  $. If $ \langle i^{+},c \rangle \in a_{n} $ by hypothesis we know that  $ c = f(i, a_{n}(i)) $ as desired. On the other hand if $\langle i^{+},c \rangle \in \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\}$ it follows by construction. Then $ n^{+} \in S $, and we conclude by induction that, there exist a n-function for every natural number. Claim 2 : For each natural number this function is unique. Proof of claim 2: 
For n = 0, the only 0-function is $ a_0 = \left\{ \langle 0, c\rangle \right\} $. If we assume that holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. Let $ a_n = a'_n $, for construction of n-functions we know that: $ a_{n^{+}} = a_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n}  \cup \left\{ \langle n^{+}, f(n,a'_{n} (n)) \rangle \right\} =a'_{n^{+}} $. Therefore all the n-functions are uniques. At this point  I'm not sure how could I derive exactly the  function 
  a, I think that maybe using the union of all the families  $ a_{n} $.
  But I'm not really sure, somebody knows? I'm not sure here, but if we use the replacement axiom for each n-function we have: Let ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" be the formula: $  ( x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = \,x-function ) \vee (\neg x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge y = 0 ) $. For the claim 2 there exist a unique n-function for each n, therefore ""$\varphi (x,y)$"" is functional. And we can apply replacement to derive: $\left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$. And (maybe) define the function $a$  to be: $a: = \bigcup \left\{a_{n}: n\in  \mathbb{N} \right\}$ Here is my attempt: By the union axiom and the replacement schema axiom $a$ defined as above is a set. So, only we need to show that indeed is a function and that all property that we wish really holds. Claim 3 : The relation a is a functional relation. Proof of Claim  3: To $a$ be a functional relation we need to show $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a \wedge  \langle x,y' \rangle \in a \rightarrow y = y'.$ if $\langle x,y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} $ at the same way $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists m \in \mathbb{N}. \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m}. $ And as $ m \in n \vee n\in m  \vee n = m$. (1) If $n = m$, by claim 2 we have that $ a_{n} = a_{m}$ and as $ a_{n} $ is functional. We're done, that means $ y = y'$ because  $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow y = y'$. (2) If  $ m \in n\, (m < n)$  by construction we know that $ a_{m} \subset a_{n}$. Then $\langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} \rightarrow \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{n} $  and as $a_{n}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. (3) At the same way if  $ n \in m\, (n < m),\, a_{n} \subset a_{m}$. Then $\langle x,y \rangle \in a_{n} \rightarrow \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} $. As  $ \langle x,y \rangle \in a_{m} \wedge \langle x,y' \rangle \in a_{m} $  and as $a_{m}$ is functional. Then $ y = y' $ as desired. Then $a$ is a functional relation. Claim 4 : The functional relation a, is a function such that $ a(0) = c \wedge a (i^{+}) = f(i, a(i))$. Proof of claim 4: (1) As definition all the n-function evaluated at 0 are c, therefore the union of all of them is c, $ \langle 0,c \rangle \in a $ as desired. (2) If  $i^{+} \in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a \leftrightarrow \exists n\in \mathbb{N}. \langle i^{+},y \rangle \in a_{n}. $ By construction of all the n-function that means $ y = f(i, a_{n} (i))$. So, only we need to show that $ a_{n} (i) = a (i) $. But since $ a_{n} $ is the restriction of $a$ at n, that follows inmediately. What do you think? Is it correct? The other exercise the book says this: Show using the last proposition there exist only one version of the natural numbers in set theory. My attempt: Let $ \mathbb{N'}$ be a set such that the Peano's axioms hold. Let f be a function, $f : \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N'} \rightarrow  \mathbb{N'} $, such that $ \langle n,n' \rangle \mapsto n'^{+}$. And, $ a: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N'}$ such that, $a(0) = 0'$ and $ a(n^{+}) = f(n, a(n)) = n'^{+} =(a(n))^{+} $. By the last proposition the function exist and it is unique. Injective part: For $n = 0$ we have $ a (0) = a(0^{*}) = 0'$, so we need to show that $0 = 0^{*}$. By the sake of the contradiction suppose $0 \neq 0^{*}$. Therefore $ 0^{*} = k^{+} $ for some $k \in \mathbb{N},\, a(0^{*})=a(k^{+}) = k'^{+}$. And as the Peano's Axiom hold in $\mathbb{N'}, k'^{+} \neq 0'$, a contradiction. Then, $ 0=0^{*} $. Suppose that our assumption holds for n, we need to show that also holds for $ n^{+} $. If
$ n'^{+}=a (n^{+}) = a (n^{*+})=n'^{*+}$. By the Peano's axioms we have $ n'^{+} = n'^{*+} \rightarrow  n'= n'^{*}$. As $a(n)=n' = a(n^{*})=n'^{*},\; a(n) = a(n^{*}) \rightarrow n = n^{*} $ (by the inductive hypothesis). Hence $ n^{+} = n^{*+}$. That closed the induction. Surjective part: By definition we know that $0' = a (0)$, so there exist a $0 \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that our assumption holds for n', that means $ n' = a(n)$ there exist a $n \in \mathbb{N}$. So, $ n' ^{+}=(n')^{+} = (a(n))^{+} = a(n^{+})$. That closed the induction. Hence exist a bijection between them. Any suggestion about all of these exercises....",['elementary-set-theory']

444488,Surface area element of an ellipsoid,"I would like to evaluate an integral numerically over the surface of an ellipsoid. Take an $N \times N$ grid over the parameter space $(u, v) \in [0, 2\pi) \times [0, \pi) $. A simple approximation of the integral is
$$

where $\Delta A(u_i, v_j)$ is the surface area of the portion of the ellipsoid spanned by the parameter region $(u_i, u_{i+1}) \times (v_j, v_{j+1})$. I had hoped to compute $\Delta A(u_i, v_j)$ analytically:
\begin{equation}
\Delta A(u_i, v_j) = \int_{u_i}^{u_{i+1}}\int_{v_j}^{v_{j+1}}dA.
\end{equation}
To derive $dA$ I used the first fundamental form , $dA = \sqrt{EG-F^2}du\,dv$. An example of its application to an ellipsoid can be found in this answer, though note that (1) $dA$ is merged with the integrand and (2) $u$ and $v$ are switched from here. Here is what I obtain: $$
dA = \sqrt{a^2b^2 \cos^2 v \sin^2 v + c^2 \sin^4v\ (b^2 \cos^2 u + a^2 \sin^2 u)}\ \ du\,dv,
$$
where $a,b,c$ are the semi-major axes associated with $x,y,z$ respectively. I am almost certain that with this expression for $dA$, the integral for $\Delta A(u_i, v_j)$ above cannot be evaluated analytically. Do I need to resort to a numerical approximation of $\Delta A(u_i, v_j)$? If so, in light of the simplistic approximation of the original integral, will it be sufficient to use the area of the trapezoid formed by connecting the image of the four points $(u_i, v_j), (u_{i+1}, v_j), (u_{i}, v_{j+1}), (u_{i+1}, v_{j+1})$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$?","['surfaces', 'differential-geometry', 'numerical-methods']"

444681,"Proof that for any interval (a,b) with a<b in the real numbers contains both rational and irrational numbers?","Background: We are assuming that the elements of $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ are irrational number . If $x$ is irrational and $r$ is rational then $y=x+r$ is irrational. Also, if $r\neq 0$ then $rx$ is irrational as well. Likewise, if a number is irrational then its reciprocal is irrational as well. Theorem: Every interval $(a,b)$, no matter how small, contains both rational and irrational numbers. Proof . First we can see that the interval $(0,1)$
  contains both rational and irrational, just select the numbers $1/2$
  and $1/\sqrt{2}$. For the general interval $(a,b)$, think of $a$
  and $b$
  as cuts, that is $a=A\mid A^{'}$
  and $b=B\mid B^{'}$
 , such that $a<b$
 . The fact that $a<b$
  implies that $B\setminus A\neq\emptyset$
 , moreover since $B$
  has no greatest value if we select an a rational element $r\in B\setminus A$
  then we can find another rational element $s\in B\setminus A$
  such that $r<s$
 . Thus $a\leqslant r<s\leqslant b$
 . The transformation
$$T:t\mapsto r+(s-r)t$$ sends the interval $(0,1)$
  to the interval $(r,s)$
 . Since $r,s,$
  and $s-r$
  are all rational, the transformation $T$
  sends rationals to rationals and irrationals to irrationals. That is, $(r,s)$
  contains and irrationals, and so does the larger interval $(a,b)$.$\space\space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \space \square$ My Confusion: My first confusion is what does the transformation  $T$ map from and to? If $t\in \mathbb R$ then for any value of  $t$  we should have $r\leqslant r+(s-r)t \leqslant s$ right? However, if  $t<0$, $r<0$, and $s<0$ then the preceding inequality shouldn't hold (unless I am missing something); and if the preceding inequality doesn't hold then what good is the transformation $T$ for  showing that there is an irrational in the interval $[r,s]$?",['real-analysis']
444696,"How to respond to ""solve this equation"" in a basic algebra class","If it's acceptable practice on math.se, I'd like to really only ask this question of math educators as opposed to students or mathematical researchers.  Some researchers will undoubtedly think the whole question is not worthy of consideration, and some students will not understand the issue. But if you really have something to contribute, please do. Imagine yourself teaching a basic algebra class: maybe to grade schoolers or to high schoolers, or in my case, to adults ages 18 and up in a community college. You will encounter ""problems"" like the following, where for now I am intentionally leaving out words: $$2x+3=6-x$$ The ""answer"" to a question like this somehow communicates that $1$ is the only solution, that $x$ needs to equal $1$, that the solution set is $\{1\}$, or $\{x\mid x=1\}$, etc. Some of my colleagues feel that if the task was to ""solve this equation"", that ""$x=1$"" is not an acceptable final response from a student. They say that ""$x=1$"" is an ""equivalent equation"" to the original equation, because it has the same solution set. They say that to ""solve this equation"", to the exclusion of other ways a student might respond, is to write a set as part of an English statement. They are happy with: ""The solution is $1$"", ""The solution set is $\{1\}$"", or ""The solution set is $\{x\mid x=1\}$"". But they are emphatic that ""$x=1$"" or ""The solution to the equation is that $x=1$"" cannot count as appropriate responses. Answers like these don't get full credit on their exams. This matters because we are creating a library of higher quality online problems (for WeBWorK) and we need to set a standard for how the solutions should be entered. I am opposed to having answer blanks where the student merely enters a number. So for example I am opposed to having something like ""The solution is _ _."" appear on screen and the student only fills in the number. This trains the student that those words don't matter; they don't have to write them and they won't generally pay them any attention. We could program the question to understand a whole sentence, but there are too many issues with alternatively worded correct sentences, not to mention poor spelling. Remember, these responses are to be automatically evaluated. I support making the students have to enter ""$x=1$"", because it is a whole statement. And if they enter something simpler, like ""$1$"", it is an easy matter to shoot back an automated message that their response is not the form we are looking for. And I counter the idea that ""$x=1$"" has to be interpreted as an ""equivalent equation"" by saying that sometimes ""$x=1$"" is an assertion (aka an assignment ) rather than an equation to solve; I'm asserting that $x$ has to equal $1$ for the equation to be true. So my question to this community, assuming you support my position, is: can you help me make better arguments for my case?

If they have difference over some specific number (like 8) it would return value that is zero, or one that is very close to zero, and same goes for higher difference. It also is a requirement that the value that the function returns does not change linearly but lets say if the difference is 0, it would be 4, if its 2-3 it would already return ~2. Then I need another function that does the same thing but instead of being based on the absolute difference of x and y , it is based on their percentage difference.

$$\lVert B(x,y)\rVert \leq M\lVert x\rVert\lVert y\rVert.$$ Is completeness needed here? The bilinearity of $B$ means for a fixed  $x\in X$,$B_x\colon Y\to Z$ is linear and for a fix $y\in Y$, $B^y:X\to Z$ is linear. Since $X,Y,Z$ are metrizable by norms, I think what we do is to show that $B$ is bounded.

I'm having a hard time getting my bearings in the world of ""geometric algebra"", even though I'm using as my guide an introductory undergraduate-level 2 book ( Linear and  geometric algebra by Macdonald). Among the general problems that I'm running into is that most definitions and theorems that I find (either in this book, or online ) seem to apply to some multivectors (e.g. to $k$ -vectors, or to blades), not all.  Sometimes it is not clear to me whether a definition or result refers to all multivectors in $\mathbb{G}^n$ or only to a distinguished subset (e.g. blades), since these definitions/theorems are expressed in terms the word ""vector"".  This leads to the pervading doubt as to whether this word ""vector"" is being meant as synonymous with ""multivector""—i.e. an object in the so-called "" vector space $\mathbb{G}^n\;$ "")—, or with "" $1$ -vector"", or with "" $k$ -vector"", or something else entirely. (Hence the specification ""clearly-worded"" in my question above.  A more accurate specification would have been ""unambiguously-worded"", but it would have been puzzling on first encounter.) Case in point is the definition of the geometric product in $\mathbb{G}^n$ .  Macdonald gives a very partial definition of this product for ""vectors"" (and only in $\mathbb{G}^3$ ) 3 , but far as I can tell Macdonald never defines this product in general, even though he uses it freely throughout much of the book! I find this astonishing, to put it mildly.  But, please correct me if I'm wrong. 1 In his answer below Alan Macdonald writes ""I do not think it possible to give a quick definition of the general geometric product.""  In light of this remark, I want to stress that succinctness is not among the requirements in my specifications what I'm looking for. 2 The original version of this post incorrectly described this book as being written for ""high-school students"", but the author pointed out this error in his answer below .  I apologize for the (now-amended) inaccuracy. 3 On p. 82, Macdonald gives a definition for the geometric product of two $1$ -vectors in $\mathbb{G}^3$ , and later explicitly states: ""We have defined the geometric product of two vectors, but not for example, the geometric product of a vector and a bivector.  This will be taken up in the next chapter, where we will learn to take the geometric product of any two multivectors.""  As far as I can tell, however, the ""next chapter"", which is called simply $\mathbb{G}^n$ , never fulfills this promise.

Now suppose that we have two finite groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of the equal size $n$. If I remember Oleg’s words right, the groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ are not necessarily isomorphic provided the families $Sub_1(G_1)$ and $Sub_1(G_2)$ are isomorphic, and there is a counterexample of two subgroups of small order. But the isomorphism of the families $Sub_1(G_1)$ and $Sub_1(G_2)$ implies the isomorphism of the groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, provided the groups are abelian. So Oleg asked me: are groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ isomorphic provided the families $Sub_2(G_1)$ and $Sub_2(G_2)$ are isomorphic?

Thus, for example, if $\phi(\beta)>>\phi(\alpha)$ the last term in the numerator is negative, but then $[-\phi'(\alpha)+\phi'(\beta)]$ should be positive, since $\alpha$ must be in the left tail while $\beta$ is close to the mean. I am not sure if there are $a,b,\mu,\sigma$ such that this derivative can become negative. In some numerical calculations I did not find such a profile. Can you find an example, or can you instead prove that it is always nonnegative?","['normal-distribution', 'calculus', 'derivatives']"
445166,Is mathematical history written by the victors?,"The question is the title of a 2013 publication in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , by twelve authors (of which I am one).  The contention is that traditional history of mathematics is based on the assumption of an inevitable evolution toward the real continuum-based framework as developed by Cantor, Dedekind, Weierstrass (referred to as the ""great triumvirate"" by Carl Boyer here ) and others. Taking some seminal remarks by Felix Klein as their starting point, the authors argue that the traditional view is lopsided and empoverishes our understanding of mathematical history.  Have the historians systematically underplayed the importance of the infinitesimal strand in the development of analysis? Editors are invited to submit reasoned responses based on factual historical knowledge, and refrain from answers based on opinion alone. To be even more explicit, we ask for additional examples from history that support either Boyer's viewpoint or the NAMS article viewpoint. That is, limit the question to facts and not opinions (based on a comment by Willie Wong at meta). Note 1.  For a closely related MO thread see this . Note 2.  A reaction to the Notices article by Craig Fraser was published here . Note 3. Another would-be victor Gray is analyzed in this MSE thread . Note 4. The Notices article originally contained a longish section on Euler, which was eventually split off into a separate article.  The article shows, using the writings of Ferraro as a case study, how an assumption of default Weierstrassian foundations deforms a scholar's vision of Euler's mathematics.  The article was recently published in 2017 in Journal for General Philosophy of Science . Note 5. A response to Craig Fraser's reaction was published in 2017 in Mat. Stud.; see this version with hyperlinks . Note 6.

$$\frac{1}{6}\times 6 = 1$$ But that can't be true. It's actually possible that I roll six dice and none of them land on 6. What about if I roll $100$ dice? It's still possible that none of the land on 6. So what are the odds that at least one will?",['probability']

So $H$ and $H'$ are related without this relation explicitly depending on $G'$. Is this also true for $M$ and $N$, i.e. is there a relation between $M$ and $N$ that does not hinge on $G'$? In the case of $N$ abelian of maximal order it might hold that $N \cong Z(G) \times M$, where $Z(G)$ is the center of $G$. At least it holds for the few groups I checked.

    f(x) := A x^2 + B x + C 
$ given $f(0) = f(h) = a/2$ and $f(h/2) = b/2$. This yields $ \displaystyle \hspace{1cm}

445354,Computing partition numbers,"Today a friend and myself came up with the question of computing partitions of numbers, i.e.: given a number $n$, what is the number $p(n)$ of was of different ways writing $n$ as a sum of non-zero integers (where commuting two terms in the sum counts as a unique way)? We know of no formulas to do this. I am currently trying to write a bruteforce (computational) approach to the problem, but I wanted to ask you about another more sophisticated way of attacking the problem (still with a computer). It is well known that 
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty p(n)x^n = \prod_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{1-x^k}$$
The idea we had is to proceed as follows: $\log\left(\prod_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{1-x^k}\right) = -\sum_{k=1}^\infty\log(1-x^k) = -\sum_{k=1}^N\log(1-x^k) + O(x^{N+1})$ where we used the Taylor expansion of $\log$ around $1$ to get the error term. $\prod_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{1-x^k}\approx \exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^N\log(1-x^k)\right) =: F(x)$ with some error term. Evaluate $F$ for some $x$ close to zero (so that the higher order terms are no longer relevant) and use polyfit (least squares) to get the coefficient of $x^n$, i.e. $p(n)$. Now my questions are the following: Would this method (or something similar) work? What would the error term in point (2.) look like? How to choose $N$ and the points $x$ where we evaluate $F$ in step (3.) such that the error is less than, say $0.1$ in the end? Notice that the preceding question is closely related to this one. What would be the complexity of the resulting algorithm? How are the $p(n)$ computed usually?
