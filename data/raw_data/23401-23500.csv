203177,A question about curves in $\mathbb{R}^2$,"I need to show this result: Let $\alpha :I\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ a smooth curve, where $I$ is a compact interval of the real line. If $\lVert \alpha (s) - \alpha (t) \rVert$ depends only on $|s-t|$, for all $s$, $t$ in $I$, then $\alpha$ must be a subset of a line or a circle. I have tried calling $\lVert \alpha (s) - \alpha (t) \rVert=f(|s-t|)$, where $f$ is smooth but this led me nowhere. Also, I had a suggestion to fixing $t$ as $0$ and $\alpha(0)=0$ through reparametrization and a rigid movement, so I would have $\lVert\alpha(s) \rVert=f(|s|)$, $f$ is smooth; this lead to nothing also. I strongly believe I must show that the curvature of this function if constant, either $0$ (then it is a line) or it is a constant $\neq 0$ from where it is in a circle.

203427,Oblique projection matrix - proof definition is correct.,"The oblique projection matrix on $\text{range}(X)$ orthogonal to $\text{range}(Y)$ is given by $P = X (Y^\top X)^\dagger Y^\top$. Prove that the above definition is right, i.e. it holds that 
$Xw^\star = Py$ where $w^\star = \text{argmin}_{w: (Xw - y)^\top Y = 0} \|Xw - y\|_2$. Edit : originally, the formula above erroneously had a min instead of an argmin. I do recognize this has the feel of very standard material, but for some reason I can't find it. It's OK if you could just name a reference. I don't know if this makes a huge difference, but I need the case where the matrix $Y^\top X$ need not be invertible (hence the pseudo-inverse). Ok, I do accept that calling the matrix $P$ an oblique projection requires that $\text{range}(X)$ and $\text{range}(Y)^\perp$ are complementary subspaces. Even given this, $Y^\top X$ may still not be invertible (consider $X=Y$ and $X$ has linearly dependent columns). Also, if we forget the geometry, it is still a legitimate question to ask, in terms of pure algebra, if $Xw^\star = Py$ for the given definition of $w^\star$, for any matrices $X$, $Y$. I am interested in this case because the question comes from an application where the matrices involved are estimated from samples and the task is to show that even when the inverse doesn't exist, the formula $X (Y^\top X)^\dagger Y^\top$ still solves the optimization as mentioned above. I have realized that the optimization given above may not be the obvious way to ask the question - the solution $X w^\star$ is already defined by just the fact that $(Xw^\star - y)^\top Y$ has to vanish, even without any optimization. Now, I'm trying to prove the following things suggested by Marc van Leeuwen below. $Pw = w$ for $w \in \text{range}(X)$. This is equivalent to saying $\forall b. PXb = Xb$, or $X(Y^\top X)^\dagger (X^\top Y) = X$. But where do I go from here? I can't just cancel the terms because $(Y^\top X)^\dagger (X^\top Y)$ isn't necessarily the identity. $Pw=0$ for $w \perp \text{range}(Y)$. This is obvious since $Y^\top w = 0$. Also, I don't see how 1 and 2 should imply the result.","['projection-matrices', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

($x^{-1}$ is $x$'s inverse) to check if the identity is an element of the subgroup: $ex=x$; $(e^{-1})ex=(e^{-1})x$; $ex=(e^{-1})x$; $e=e^{-1}$. To check closure: this is where I'm not sure I know what I am doing. To check closure, I need to show that... $(ab)x=(ab)^{-1}(x^{-1})$? Let $a,b\in H$, $(ab)(ab)= e$ if $(ab)=(ab)^{-1}$. From that we can get $(aa)(bb)=e$ because we have commutativity and associativity from our group. We know $a=a^{-1}$, $b=b^{-1}$, so $(aa^{-1})(bb^{-1})=e$, $ee=e$; $e=e$. So... $(ab)=ab^{-1}$. If I plug that into $(ab)x=(ab)^{-1}(x^{-1})$, and say that $(ab)x=(ab)(x^{-1})$.  If I left multiply with a $(ab)^{-1}$, I get $x=x^{-1}$.  Which is what I started with so... I'm done? To check inverses: the group includes inverses by definition of the group. H is closed, includes the identity, and inverses, so it is a subgroup of $G$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
203472,"$f_n \to f$ a.e. and $g$ continuous at $f(x)$ for a.e. $x$, then $g\circ f_n \to g \circ f$ a.e.","Okay, this is a question from Cohn (3.1 exercise 3). I think I solved it, but I didn't use two major hypotheses. Here is the question: Let $(X, \mathscr{A}, \mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f$ and $f_1,f_2,\ldots$ be real-valued $\mathscr{A}$ measurable functions on $X$, and let $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be Borel measurable. Show that if $\{f_n\}$ converges to $f$ almost everywhere, and if $g$ is continuous at $f(x)$ for almost every $x$, then $\{g \circ f_n\}$ converges to $g \circ f$ almost everywhere. Here is what I have come up with. Since $f_n \to f$ a.e. we may choose $N_1$ with $\mu(N_1)=0$ containing all the points with $f_n(x)\not\to f(x)$. Similarly, choose $N_2$  with $\mu(N_2)=0$ containing all the points where $g$ is not continuous at $f(x)$. Then $\mu(N_1 \cup N_2) = 0$. Let $x \notin N_1 \cup N_2$ be given. Then since $x \notin N_1$ we have $f_n(x) \to f(x)$. Furthermore, since $x \notin N_2$ we have that $g$ is continuous at $f(x)$, so since $\{f_n(x)\}$ is a sequence converging to $f(x)$ we have
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}(g \circ f_n)(x)=\lim_{n \to \infty}g(f_n(x)) = g(\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)) = g(f(x)) = (g\circ f)(x).
$$
So $g \circ f_n \to g \circ f$ except possibly on the measure zero set $N_1 \cup N_2$, i.e. almost everywhere. QED. But I didn't use the fact that any of the $\{f_n\}$ are measurable, nor the fact that $g$ is Borel measurable. Where have I gone wrong?",['measure-theory']
203485,How to define difference quotients for Sobolev functions,"There is a definition for difference quotients of Sobolev functions I do not understand. Let $U\subset\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be open sets such that the closure of $U$ is compact in $\Omega$ and let $h\in\mathbb{R}$ with $0<|h| < \mbox{dist}(U,\partial\Omega)$. Then one defines a function $\partial^h_i u$ on $U$ by $\partial_i^h u(x) := \frac{u(x+he_i) - u(x)}{h}$, (where $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$), see e.g. [1]. But how can one even define this? One must be able to evaluate $u$ at $x$ and $x+he_i$, but since $u$ is only an $L^p$-function, point evaluation is not even well defined. One needs higher regularity, I assume - an unique continuous representative of $u$ which can be evaluated. But no mention of such higher regularity is made in [1] (and the other texts on PDEs I'm reading) where such difference quotients are used. So I guess that no such higher regularity is needed after all? Am I missing something obvious here? Why can one define $\partial_i^h u$ in such a way? Could you please give me a hint why this definition works or recommend me some literature on this? Thank you in advance! Reference: [1] Lawrence C. Evans, ""Partial Differential Equations"", 5.8.2.

203669,Can the sign of a continuous function be 'made Riemann integrable'?,"Question: I would like to know whether the following statement is true: For every continuous function $f:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ there is a Riemann-integrable function $g:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ with values in $[-1,1]$ such that $\int f\cdot g=\int |f|$. Motivation: I am trying to prove that the canonical bounded linear injection $X\to X^{**}$ of a normed space into its double (continuous) dual is isometric, for the specific case of $X=C[0,1]$ in the $L^1$-norm, without using Hahn-Banach , and without using the Lebesgue integral . So I want to constructively cook up for each continuous $f$ a functional $\alpha$ on $C[0,1]$ of norm 1 which maps $f$ to its norm. From Lebesgue integration we know: the dense inclusion $C[0,1]\to L^1[0,1]$ yields an isomorphism $L^\infty[0,1]\cong(L^1[0,1])^*\to (C[0,1])^*$, so every functional (of unit norm) on $C[0,1]$ must be given by integration against an essentially bounded function (with essential supremum equal to 1). I am hoping to get such a function which is Riemann integrable. Some thoughts: A naive guess is to take $g_0=|f|/f$, i.e. the 'sign' of $f$, and set it to be $0$ (say) on points where $f$ is zero. Then $g_0=1_{\{f>0\}}+0\cdot 1_{\{f=0\}}-1_{\{f<0\}}$. This $g_0$ is measurable (the sets $\{f>0\},\{f<0\}$ are open as $f$ is continuous) with essential supremum equal to 1. But I am afraid this (for suitable $f$) is NOT Riemann integrable for the following reason. Riemann integrability of this bounded function is equivalent to being continuous outside a set of measure zero. If I am not mistaking, the discontinuity set of $g_0$ is precisely $\partial\{f=0\}$, the boundary of the zero set of $f$. Since every closed set of $[0,1]$ is the zero-set of a continuous function (e.g. the 'distance to that set'), it suffices to construct a closed set of nonzero measure consisting solely of boundary points. For example the closure of a nowhere dense set (i.e. a closed with empty interior) of positive measure will do. The (closure of the) fat Cantor set is an example of such a set. My problem is that this $f$ (the distance function) does not take both positive and negative values, and I could imagine that an adjustment of the behaviour of $g_0$ at $\{f=0\}$ could 'compensate' for this.","['integration', 'real-analysis']"

However since the space of all square integrable functions on the unit interval forms a Hilbert space, and all Hilbert Spaces are Banach, this space must not be of countable dimension.  However we know that each point has a unique decomposition as a sum complex exponentials $e^{2n\pi}$ were $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.  Thus these complex exponentials form a basis.

Let $F=(h,k)$ be a point not necessarily inside the circle. Let $M=(a\cos\theta,a\sin\theta)$ be a point in the circle, and $L$ the line that pases through $M$ and $F$. Let $L_1$ be the line passing through the midpoint of $MO$ where $O$ is the origin, perpendicular to $MO$. Then the curve sought is the locus of points of the point of intersection of $L$ and $L_1$. You can check that these two lines can be written as $$y =  - \frac{1}{{\tan (t)}}\left( {x - \frac{{a\cos \left( t \right)}}{2}} \right) + \frac{{a{\text{ }}\sin (t)}}{2}{\text{ }}$$ and $$y = \frac{{a\sin (t) - k}}{{a\cos (t) - h}}{\text{ }}(x - h){\text{ }} + k$$ This, what we want to is express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $t$ and the curve will be $(x(t),y(t))$. Now, although the plotting soft produces the right curves, I have failed $4$ times already to solve for $x$ and $y$. I am getting $$x(t) = \frac{{2a\cot t\cos t  + 2a\sin t  + {\text{2}}f\left( t  \right)h - 2k}}{{{\text{ 2}}f\left( t  \right) + 2\cot t }}{\text{ }}$$ and $$y(t)=f(t)(x(t)-h)+k$$ where $${\text{ }}\frac{{a\sin (t) - k}}{{a\cos (t) - h}} = f\left( t \right)$$ but this fails to give the correct parametrization. Could you help to find a closed expression in terms of $t$ and verify it is correct? These are pics of the curves generated.

203736,Homotopy Question Help?,"Let $X$ be a topological space and suppose $X_1$ and $X_2$ are spaces obtained by attaching an n-cell to $X$ via homotopic attaching maps. Show that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are homotopy equivalent. Proof: So, my idea is to use the fact that if two spaces are homeomorphic to deformation retracts of a single larger space then they are homotopy equivalent to one another. So, I would need to either show that both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are deformation retracts of some space, or homeomorphic to some deformation retracts of this larger space. Since n-cells are homeomorphic to the balls $\mathbb{B}^n$, ( with $\mathbb{B}^n$ we are denoting the closed n-ball here) the idea would be to consider the larger adjunction space $X\bigcup_{\phi}\mathbb{B}^n\times I$, where the attaching map $\phi:\mathbb{B}^n\times \{0\}\rightarrow X$ would be given by $\phi(x,0)=f(x)$, where $f:\mathbb{B}^n\rightarrow X$ would be some continuous map. On the other hand we know that $X_1$ is the space obtained from $X$ by attaching an $n$-cell, so it is homeomorphic to an adjunction space, more specifically: $X\bigcup_{f_1}\mathbb{B}^n$, where $f_1:\partial\mathbb{B}^n\rightarrow X,$ is the corresponding attaching map. Similarly, $X_2$ is homeomorphic to the adjunction space $X\bigcup_{f_2}\mathbb{B}^n$, where $f_2:\partial\mathbb{B}^n\rightarrow X,$ is the corresponding attaching map. So, I guess, now to conclude the proof, it would suffice to show that $X\bigcup_{f_1}\mathbb{B}^n$ and $X\bigcup_{f_2}\mathbb{B}^n$ are deformation retracts of $Z_f:=X\bigcup_{\phi}\left(\mathbb{B}^n\times I\right).$ So, we need to define a homotopy: $H:Z_f\times I\rightarrow Z_f.$ Before we do that, let $q:X\amalg\left(\mathbb{B}^n\times I\right)\rightarrow Z_f,$ be the quotient map between the given disjoint union of those spaces and $Z_f.$ Now, let us define the homotopy as follows: $$H(q(b,s),t)=q(b,s(1-t)),\hspace{3mm} H(q(x),t)=q(x),$$ where $(b,s)\in \mathbb{B}^n\times I$, and $x\in X.$ Now, $H(q(b,s),0)=q(b,s)$ and $H(q(x),0)=q(x),$ also $H(q(b,s),1)=q(b,0)\in\mathbb{B}^n\times\{0\}$ and $H(q(x),1)=q(x)\in X.$ So, i believe this shows that they are deformation retractions, but i think i am missing something  here??

Let $N_{r}$ be the $(r+1)$ by $(r+1)$ matrix $$N_r = [a_{ij}] = \begin{pmatrix} {1}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{\dots}\\{0}&{1}&{1}&{0}&{0}&{ }\\{0}&{0}&{1}&{1}&{0}&{ }\\{0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{1}&{\dots}\\{0}&{0}&{0}&{0}&{1}&{ }\\{\vdots}&{ }&{ }&{\vdots}&{ }&{\ddots}\\ \end{pmatrix}.$$ Let $N_r^n = [b_{ij}]$. Then $\binom{n}{r} = b_{1(r+1)}$. Obtain $N_r^n \pmod{m}$ using repeated squaring with the binary representation of $n$, and hence $q$. The complexity seems to be $O ((r+1)^3 \log_2(n))$, not amazing compared with just computing $\frac{n (n-1) \dots (n-r+1)}{r(r-1) \dots 1}$. Of course there will be almost identical rows of $N_r^k$ which may be exploited in computing $q$ in this way so being clever might reduce the complexity to $O ((r+1)^2 \log_2(n))$.

203816,Counting multidimensional structures (Chomp game states),"The game Chomp is described as follows on Wikipedia : Chomp is a 2-player game of strategy played on a rectangular
  ""chocolate bar"" made up of smaller square blocks (rectangular cells).
  The players take it in turns to choose one block and ""eat it"" (remove
  from the board), together with those that are below it and to its
  right. The top left block is ""poisoned"" and the player who eats this
  loses. I am interested in counting the number of possible game states, including the initial game state where all the chocolate is left, and the end-game state where all the chocolate is gone. $2$-dimensions In the 2-dimensional case, this is possible using the following observation: We will visualise a game board as follows: $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
x & x & x & x\\ \hline
x & x & x & x\\ \hline
x & x & x & -\\ \hline
-& - & - & -\\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ where $x$ denote the remaining blocks, and the $-$ corresponds to removed blocks. Any 2-dimensional game state, is characterised by the cells on the boundary of the remaining cells (the cells which are adjacent - either directly or diagonally - to a removed cell or the bottom or right side of the board). Here are some examples of game states, with boundary cells highlighted $$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
x & x & x & {\bf x}\\ \hline
x & x & {\bf x} & {\bf x}\\ \hline
{\bf x} & {\bf x} & {\bf x} & -\\ \hline

x & {\bf x} & - & -\\ \hline
{\bf x} & {\bf x} & - & -\\ \hline
{\bf x} & - & - & -\\ \hline
\end{array}
$$ In turn, such a boundary corresponds to a special walk on the grid graph constructed by letting each cell be a vertex, and by joining vertices corresponding to adjacent cells (note that the end-state corresponds to the empty walk). These walks start in the left-most column of the grid graph, and end in the top row of the grid graph. Using this bijection from game states to such walks, we compute the number of game states as follows: The number of game states in a 2-dimensional chomp-game with $n_1$ rows and $n_2$ columns is given by $$
1 + \sum_{d_1 = 1}^{n_1} \sum_{d_2 = 1}^{n_2} \binom{d_1 + d_2 - 2}{d_1-1}.
$$ which is based on the number of staircase walks . The plus one takes care of the end-game state. For example, plugging in $n_1=n_2=2$ gives us
$$
1 + \sum_{d_1 = 1}^{2} \sum_{d_2 = 1}^{2} \binom{d_1 + d_2 - 2}{d_1-1}
=
1 +
\binom{0}{0} + 
\binom{1}{0} + 
\binom{1}{1} + 
\binom{2}{1} +

For instance, if I have a point $(x, y)$, how can I test whether or not $y > \sin(x)$? Obviously taking the actual $\sin(x)$ (or $\cos(x)$) is not an option otherwise I wouldn't be asking. All three angles, $A, B$, and $x$ are first-quadrant angles in $[0, 90°]$. Additionally, I know two reference points, A and B such that A < x < B, and I know both the sine and cosine of A and B. I thought perhaps comparing slopes might be useful, for instance, I know that the slope of the tangent at A is greater than the slope of the secant from A to x, which is greater than the slope of the secant from x to B, which is greater than the slope of the tangest at B.

I'm currently able to estimate sines and cosines of any angle in degrees to within $10\%$ error, but I'd really like to be able to take those initial estimates and then refine them further with some kind of simple iterative process that can be carried out relatively quickly with pencil and paper.

Now, suppose that $\hat c=[\hat c_1,\hat c_2]^T$, where $\hat c_1=\hat c_1(t),\hat c_2=\hat c_2(t)$ are differentiable functions with constant term $0$, and let $\hat x=\Phi\hat c+\Phi d$ for some constant vector $d$. Noting that $$A\Phi=\left[\begin{array}{cc}-e^{it} & e^{-it}\\-ie^{it} & -ie^{-it}\end{array}\right]=\Phi',$$ it follows that $$(\Phi\hat c)'=\Phi'\hat c+\Phi\hat c'=A\Phi\hat c+\Phi\hat c',$$ so since $A\Phi d=(\Phi d)'$ by the work done with the homogeneous system, then $$\hat x'=(\Phi\hat c)'+(\Phi d)'=A\Phi\hat c+\Phi\hat c'+A\Phi d=A\hat x+\Phi\hat c'.$$ Thus, $$\hat x'=A\hat x+b\quad\text{if and only if}\quad\Phi\hat c'=b.$$ Now, $\Phi$ is invertible, so letting $c$ be the antiderivative (with respect to $t$) of $\Phi^{-1}b$ without integration constant, we should have that $x=\Phi c+\Phi d$ is the general solution to $(2)$, and then $x_1$ would be the general solution to $(1)$, yes?
