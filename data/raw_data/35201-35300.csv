336097,Finding a vector orthogonal to a subspace,"Suppose you were given vectors $a_1,\dots,a_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$ then how would you compute some vector orthogonal to the given list of vectors? Note that you are allowed to return the zero vector only if the vectors span $\mathbb{R}^m$. I thought about it for a while and the best I could do was to form the matrix with these vectors as rows and pick a vector from the nullspace. Is there an easier/faster way? Perhaps something geometric like Gram-Schmidt could be possible. Thanks!",['linear-algebra']
336098,"Proof: if the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$ intersect, they do so on the line $y=x$","This came out of a textbook problem, and as Lubin pointed out below, it's not actually true as originally stated. I'm guessing it should be restated as: If the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at some value(s) of $x$, but not at all values of $x$ in their respective domains ($f$ is not it's own inverse), then any points of intersection fall on the line $y=x$. Or maybe it could just say: If the graphs of $y=f(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$ intersect at a finite number of points, then any points of intersection fall on the line $y=x$. I'm sure its staring me right in the face. It's totally intuitive and I can see it on the graph, but when I try to prove it analytically I end up chasing my tail. Here's what I've got so far: Suppose $f$ is an invertible function. Then it's necessarily one-to-one, so for any $a,b$ in the domain of $f$, it is true that $f(a)=f(b)$ if and only if $a=b$. The same is true of $f^{-1}$. Now suppose a point $(a,b)$ lies on both $y=f(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$. Then $b=f(a)$, which implies $a=f^{-1}(b)$. Also, $b=f^{-1}(a)$, which implies $a=f(b)$. So we know,
$$f(a)=f^{-1}(a)=b$$
and,
$$f(b)=f^{-1}(b)=a$$
and I'd think it would be relatively simple to combine these and prove that $a=b$, but I keep going in circles and proving stuff like $a=a$. I've tried making use of $a=f^{-1}(f(a))$, but still no dice. Any help would be much appreciated.","['inverse', 'functions']"

336133,What is the property that allows $5^{2x+1} = 5^2$ to become $2x+1 = 2$?,"What is the property that allows $5^{2x+1} = 5^2$ to become $2x+1 = 2$? We just covered this in class, but the teacher didn't explain why we're allowed to do it.",['algebra-precalculus']
336135,"Can a sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a normed linear space satisfies that $\lim{l(x_n)} = l(x)$ for a set dense in $X'$,but not weakly converge?","Suppose that a sequence $\{x_n\}$ of points in a normed linear space satisfies that $\lim{l(x_n)} = l(x)$ for a set $A$ of $l$ dense in  $X'$(the dual of $X$,  the collection of all continuous linear functionals, with the norm $|f|_{\infty} = \sup_{X}|f(x)|$).

336143,Is $\omega_n$ exact in $\mathbb R^n -\{0 \}$?,"For $n \ge 2$ consider the differential form $\omega_n=r^{-n} \sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i-1}x_idx_1 \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_{i-1} \wedge dx_{i+1} \wedge \ldots \wedge dx_n$, defined on $\mathbb R^n \setminus \{ \bf0\}$. (where, $r=\sqrt{x_1^2+\ldots + x_n^2}$). Is it exact there? I think the answer is no, and I've verified my answer for $n=2,3$ by integrating $\omega_n$ over the unit $(n-1)$-sphere $S^{n-1}$ to a nonzero result. I guess it's true for all values of $n$, but the calculations become very cumbersome (many $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ Jacobians to find...). I also need to prove that the boundaries are empty. Is there a more sophisticated way of proving that $\omega_n$ is not exact? If not, can anyone help my with the calculations?","['differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'real-analysis']"
336182,A proof with Legendre polynomials and an integral minimum value,"I need to prove that, over the monic polynomials $f$ of degree $n$, the integral $$\int_{-1}^1\bigl(f(x)\bigr)^2\,dx$$ takes its minimum value when $$f(x)=\frac{2^n}{\binom{2n}n}L_n(x),$$ where $L_n(x)$ is the $n$th Legendre polynomial.",['functional-analysis']
336188,How to quantify the distance between matrices with an irrelevant rotation factor?,"Suppose you have two invertible matrices $A$, $B$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, that is, $A,B\in GL(n)$.  You want to define a distance between them that ignores arbitrary rotational factors, so basically if $M\in O(n)$ is an orthogonal matrix and $A = MB$, $||A-B|| = 0$.  One way to do this would be to take the geodesic length between $A, B \in GL(n)/O(n)$, the quotient group of invertible matrices over orthogonal matrices.  How would you compute this geodesic distance?","['matrices', 'lie-groups', 'differential-geometry']"
336190,"Show that a set $D$ is measurable with respect to a product measure $m \times \nu$, (lebesgue $\times$ counting measure)","Let $m$ be the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$, and $\nu$ be the counting measure on $[0,1]$. Show that the diagonal (1) $$D = \{ (x,x), x \in [0,1] \}  $$ is measurable with respect to $m \times \nu$, but if $\chi_{D}$ denotes its characteristic function then (2) $$ \int_{[0,1]}\int_{[0,1]} \chi_{D}(x,y)\,dm(x)\,d\nu(y) \neq \int_{[0,1]} \int_{[0,1]} \chi_{D}(x,y)\,d\nu(y)\,dm(x).$$ Ok, so I do not have so much experience of product measures. Let's start with showing that is a measurable set. What does it take for $D$ to be measurable w.r.t. $m \times \nu$ ? Must it lie in a sigma-algebra, (which is not given in the exercise)? Or what do I have to show? And how about (2)? My guess is that it has something to with that the counting measure is infinite on $[0,1]$. Shall it be seen as a integral in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $D$ as the line $y = x$? Then the lebesgue measure of a straight line in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is always zero and the left integral would be $0$? On the other hand, in the right integral we have an inner integral w.r.t. the counting measure which is infinite so that one equals $\infty$? On this one I am quite stuck and any help and explanation of what is going on is appreciated. / Erik","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
336191,Numbers represented by a cubic form,"EDIT, April 11, 2013: See answer at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/127160/numbers-integrally-represented-by-a-ternary-cubic-form/127295#127295 This is part 2 ( of 25 discriminants of class number exactly three) of primes represented integrally by a homogeneous cubic form I think two will be enough. Given integers $a,b,c,$ and cubic form
$$ f(a,b,c) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a^2 b  - a b^2 + 3 a^2 c - a c^2  + b^2 c - b c^2  - 4 a b c $$
$$ f(a,b,c) =
\det  \left(  \begin{array}{ccc}
  a  &  b & c  \\
  c & a + c & b + c \\
   b + c   &  b + 2 c  & a + b + 2 c
\end{array} 
  \right)  .  $$ 
what primes $p$ can be integrally represented as
$$  p = f(a,b,c)? $$ I think it is  all primes $(p| 11) = -1 ,$ and all $p = u^2 + 11 v^2$ in integers, but not any $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2.$ 
Note that, if $-p$ is represented, so is $p.$ I also suspect that if  prime $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2$ and $f(a,b,c) \equiv 0 \pmod q,$  then all three $a,b,c \equiv 0 \pmod q,$ and  $f(a,b,c) \equiv 0 \pmod {q^3}.$ Note that if $f$ integrally represents both $m,n$ then it represents $mn.$ That is because $f(a,b,c) = \det(aI + b X + c X^2),$ where
$$ X =  \left(  \begin{array}{ccc}
  0  &  1 & 0  \\
  0 & 0 & 1 \\
   1  &  1  & 1
\end{array} 
  \right)    $$ Then $X^3 = X^2 + X + I$ and $X^4 = 2 X^2 + 2 X + I.$ If all suspicions are correct, we can correctly describe all numbers integrally represented by this polynomial: positive or negative are unimportant, most prime factors are unimportant, all that matters is that every exponent of a prime factor $q = 3 u^2 + 2 u v + 4 v^2$ must be divisible by 3. I should have done this last time: most of the class field part has already been done, by Hudson and Williams (1991) , Theorem 1 and Table 1 on page 134. You get my version of the polynomial by negating their variable $x.$ Note the connection to the ""tribonacci"" numbers, with precisely the formalism I described at Fibonacci Sequence in $\mathbb Z_n$. =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= p           a           b           c

336319,A question to be solved via the Pidgeonhole Principle,"Question: Let $n_1, n_2, \cdots, n_t$ be positive integers. Show that if $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_t - t + 1$ objects are placed into $t$ boxes, then for some $i$ , $i = 1, 2, \cdots, t, $ the $i$ th box contains at least $n_i$ objects. Attempt: So, before I began attempting to solve this, I decided to see if this was actually true, but I couldn't get what I'm supposed to show to even be correct. Here are the numbers I chose: $n_1 = 5, n_2 = 3, n_3 = 6, n_4 =8, n_5 = 7, n_6 = 2.$ This implies that $t = 6,$ and we have $i = 1, 2, \cdots, 6$ . So, next step is to do $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_t - t + 1 = 5 + 3 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 2 - 6 + 1 = 26.$ I distribute these 26 objects among my boxes one box at a time, so one time through, each box obtains 1 object, which leaves $26-6 = 20$ objects left to distribute. Follow this pattern and we end with box $1$ containing $5$ objects, box $2$ containing $5$ objects, and boxes $3, 4, 5, 6$ containing $4$ objects each. According to the question, the $i$ th box should hold at least $n_i$ objects, but if you look at the $4$ th box, where $i = 4$ , then you witness that it only holds $4$ objects, not at least $n_4 = 8$ objects. Am I misinterpreting the question? I understand that if I stick with variables, I could show the statement holds through contradiction. For instance, If every box, $i$ , contains $n_i - 1$ objects at most, then $\sum_{i=1}^t n_i - 1 = n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_t - t < n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_t - t + 1$ , which is a contradiction, because we have $n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_t - t + 1$ .

I know of the following examples: $R \rightarrow R[X]$, where $X$ is an indeterminate over $R$ (or any set of algebraically independent indeterminates over $R$) $R \rightarrow R[[X]]$, where $X$ is an analytic indeterminate over $R$ (or any finite set of such) If $R$ is a field, take any (unital) ring map $R \rightarrow S$ such that $S$ is an integral domain. If $R$ is a Noetherian valuation domain, the map $R \rightarrow \hat{R}$ will work. Whenever $g: R \rightarrow S$ is an example of this and $W$ is a multiplicatively closed subset of $S$ such that $m S_W \neq S_W$ for any maximal ideal $m$ of $R$, then the induced map $R \rightarrow S_W$ works as well.  (Some other localizations will be fine too.) Then there are cases that sometimes work.  For instance, one might expect $R \rightarrow \hat{R}$ to work, where $(R,m)$ is an arbitrary Noetherian local ring and $\hat{R}$ is its $m$-adic completion.  (As noted above, this works for valuation rings.)  However, it only works when $R/p$ is analytically irreducible for every prime ideal $p$ of $R$.  It fails, for instance, when $R$ is the localization of $k[x,y]$ at $(x,y)$ when $k$ is a field of characteristic other than $2$.

336804,Elementary Proof Involving Wronskian and Existence and Uniqueness,"I’m in need of some help to understand an elementary proof involving the Wronskian of $n$ vector functions and the following existence and uniqueness theorem. Existence and Uniqueness Suppose $A(t)$ and $f(t)$ are continuous on an open interval $I$ that contains the point $t_0$ . Then, for any choice of initial vector $x_0$ , there exists a unique solution $x(t)$ on the whole interval $I$ to the initial value problem $$x’(t) = A(t)x(t) + f(t) \space \space , \space \space x(t_0) = x_0$$ The proof I’m reading is about how if $x_1, \space \ldots \space, x_n$ are linearly independent solutions on $I$ then the Wronskian is never zero. So I understand that if the Wronskian is zero this implies that the vector functions are linearly dependent which implies that $$c_1 x_1(t_0)  \space + \space \ldots \space + \space c_n x_n(t_0) = 0$$ At some point $t_0$ (ie a non-trivial solution exists at some point). Now here is what my textbook goes on to say: … However, $c_1 x_1(t_0)  \space + \space \ldots \space + \space c_n x_n(t_0) = 0$ and the vector function $z(t) \equiv 0$ are both solutions to $x’ = Ax$ on I, and they agree at the point $t_0$ . So these solutions must be identical on $I$ according to the existence and uniqueness theorem (What!?). So this may be obvious to some, but I’m having a hard time understanding what the existence and uniqueness theorem means in this context and how it proves that it is zero for all $t$ .

336827,Why must a finite covering map be closed?,"A covering map $p:C\to X$ is finite when for each $x\in X$ we have $|p^{-1}(x)|<\infty.$ I have to prove that such a covering map has to be closed. I'm having trouble with it. When $p$ is a covering map, we can take open neighborhoods $U_x$ of every point $x\in X$ such that $p^{-1}(U_x)$ is a disjoint union of open neighborhoods $U_{x_i}$ of $x_i$, where $\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}=p^{-1}(x)$, and $p$ maps each $U_{x_i}$ homeomorphically onto $U_x$. I see that when I have a closed subset $A\subseteq C$ such that $p(C)\subseteq U_x$ for a certain $x\in X$, then $p(A)$ is closed. That's because in this case $A$ is a disjoint union of $A\cap U_{x_i}$ and each of this sets is closed. (Well, certainly they're closed in $U_{x_i}.$ I'm not sure why it must be closed in $C$, but I think it must.) Since $p$ is a homeomorphism on $A\cap U_{x_i}$, we have that each $p(A\cap U_{x_i})$ is closed. (Again, certainly in $U_x$, and I think in $X$ too.)  Since there are finitely many of them, they're union, that is $p(A)$ is closed too. I'm sure there are problems with this reasoning, which show how little I understand of topology, but I think the gist of it is right. But I don't see how I can make this local property global. What if $p(A)$ is large? And what if $A$ spans several components of $C$? This is a homework question.","['general-topology', 'covering-spaces']"

On any interval that contains $0$ convergence will not occur.  On any inverval that does not contain $0$ there is uniform convergence by the Weierstrass M-Test.

It's maybe because it requires solving some math, which is something I hope you could help me with. So Flash uses a simple frustum model with a viewpoint, projection plane, and focal length , which is the distance from the viewpoint to the projection plane.

To achieve the effect, the rectangle is rotated by some angle .

But while having done lot of physics courses, I see that if I learn pure math I would understand lot of things better and also probably my modeling skills also might get better. A math prof asked me to do all courses from basic analysis to differential geometry. But that would take time as I see I am taking time doing rudin(principles of mathematical analysis) . So I am little confused whether am going the right way. Any suggestions?",['analysis']

337201,Computing the intersection divisors of a smooth projective cubic curve.,"Let $X$ be the smooth projective plane cubic curve defined by $y^2z=x^3-xz^2.$ Compute the intersection divisors of the lines defined by $x=0,y=0,$ and $z=0$ with $X$. Here is an idea: Any point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ of intersection between the line $x=0$ and the curve must satisfy $x_0=0$ and $y_0^2z_0=0.$ This means the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ must satisfy $x_0=0$ and one of the following : $y_0=0$ and $z_0=0$. Is this the right way to go about it? Any suggestions/hints will be helpful. Thanks.
Edit: I removed some statements that weren't refined.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

If you know me at all, or have read my profile, or have seen any of my previous questions, you might know that I am very interested in Olympiad maths and have come across many challenging maths problems, although I'm not too strong in the functions department myself. Could you please help me with the following problem? Again, any help and contributions are greatly appreciated. For each positive integer $n$, define $f(n)$ such that $f(n)$ is a positive integer, $f(n+1)$ $>$ $f(n)$ and $f(f(n))$ $=$ $3n$. The value of $f(10)$ is? This was a multiple choice question, and the possible answers were (A)12, (B)15, (C)19, (D)21, (E)30 Okay, so far I know that this function must be injective because it is strictly increasing, because $f(n+1) > f(n)$. I don't think that we can know yet if this function is surjective or not. This shouldn't be too much of a hassle for most experienced mathematicians (like the users of this site) but for me it makes little sense. And I try, I really do! Just now I searched what injective and surjective means, and I finally understand that much, so... yea. Improvement. Anyway, any help or contributions will be greatly appreciated.

He can only turn around and go back the other way immediately after painting a post, and each post can only be painted once. How should he do this if $n=5$, and if $n=13$? Can you generalise this to any $n$? Hello everyone. I've done a lot with this one. The largest number I can get for the $n=5$ case is $10$, and $78$ for the $n=13$ case, using the equation $n(n-1)/2$, which is just from the sum of natural numbers. It can also be shown using induction that this can be generalised to any n. My problem is, how can I prove that this is truly the least efficient way of doing things? I can clearly see that there is no better option, but I'm not sure how to project that mathematically. Thank you.",['discrete-mathematics']
337272,Show that unit circle is compact?,"Quick question. Say we are given the unit circle $\{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2+y^2=1 \}$. Is this set compact? How can I prove that this is closed? Bounded? Do I have to take the complement of the set, showing that that set is open (and so unit circle is closed)? Any other trick? In addition, how can I show that $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: x^2+y^2 < 1\}$ is not compact? I have to show that this thing is open, how can I do that? I know that compact is equivalent by saying that the set is bounded and closed, if we are talking about subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. I also can see that the unit discs are bounded, because the distance between any two points in the set is bounded. But how to show that those are open/closed?

337308,"Is this an undergraduate-level proof of conservation of energy, or an arbitrary manipulation of symbols that happens to give the right answer?","This is a slightly farcical question, for which I apologise. An undergraduate tutee of mine was faced with the following problem: Q. A particle of mass $m$ moving along a line is subject to a force $F(x) = −dV /dx.$ Show that the energy $E =\frac{1}{2}mv^2+V(x)$ is constant. Here is his answer. A. We're given $F(x)=-dV/dx.$ Now $F=ma$, so $m\ddot{x}=-dV/dx .$ Next observe $\ddot{x}=\frac{d\dot{x}}{dt}=\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}\dot{x}$. Hence $m\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx} = -dV/dx$, and integrating wrt $x$ we get $\frac12m\dot{x}^2 + V(x)=C$ a constant. Is that a proof? On some formal level it looks fine to me. However an applied mathematician friend of mine (I'm a pure mathematiaian) objected that the UG had only proved that the energy was constant independent of $x$, rather than independent of $t$. I have no idea what that even means, on some level. On the other hand whilst I'm completely happy with the formal aspects of the argument, I have this uncomfortable feeling that if I were pressed to define $\frac{d\dot{x}}{dx}$ I would go for something like ""change in $\dot{x}$ divided by change in $x$ and then take the limit"" and if then someone observed that if the particle were stationary and $V$ were constant then $x$ wouldn't actually be changing so what does it even mean to change it, I think I'd be beginning to feel uncomfortable. The bottom line was that the marker didn't like it, because they claimed that something like $d(\dot{x})/dx$ was meaningless, and didn't give him any marks. I want to argue that usually it's meaningful but on the other hand...what am I saying here. I think I'm saying that part of me wants to resort to arguing that this proof is supposed to be applying to some space of potentials $V$, which are supposed to be at the very least continuous, so perhaps we could attempt to put some extra structure on the space of all potentials (e.g. restrict to $x$ in some closed and bounded interval and put some $L^2$ norm on it or something) and the potentials for which the argument seems a bit vague are some small subset of this space and so by continuity we should be fine. On the other hand this incident simply brings flooding back all the memories of the struggles I had doing applied mathematics when I was an undergraduate myself, when I would just try and answer the questions by formally manipulating the symbols and hoping that what I did would be bought by the people marking the questions. Presumably there are people out there that have a sufficiently rigorous way of thinking about this sort of question that they can say for sure whether this argument actually deserves any marks? Is it really an argument that ""isn't quite rigorous but can be made rigorous using a standard technique""? Or is it fine? Or, heaven forfend, is it a question for which different people might have different opinions??","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'physics']"
337309,"Show that, if $f:A\to B$ is a function, with $A$ and $B$ being finite sets, and $|A|=|B|$, then $f$ is one to one iff $f$ is onto.","I'm a little stuck with this proof. Not sure where to go.

337397,Show that the infinite intersection of nested non-empty closed subsets of a compact space is not empty,"I'm given the following problem: Suppose that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ $V_n$ is a non-empty, closed subset of a compact space $X$, with $V_n \supseteq V_{n+1}$. Now I have to show that $V_{\infty}= \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} V_n \neq \emptyset$. How can I do that? I know the nested interval property from real analysis... The 'answer' should be that the family $\{V_n: n\in \mathbb{N} \}$ has the finite intersection property - the intersection of any finite subfamily $\{V_{n_1}, V_{n_2}, ..., V_{n_r} \}$ is $V_N$, where $N$ is $\max \{n_1,n_2, ..., n_r \}$ and $V_N \neq \emptyset$. Hence since $X$ is compact another exercise $(*)$ says that $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} V_n$ is non-empty. Exercise $(*)$ was about to prove that for a space $X$ to be compact, it is necessary and sufficient condition that if $\{V_i: i\in I \}$ is any indexed family of closed subsets of $X$ such that $\bigcap_{j\in J}V_j$ is non-empty for any finite subset $J \subseteq I$, then $\bigcap_{i\in I}V_i$ is non-empty. So I don't understand the proof now.... Can somebody clarify this stuff? :-) Thanks for your trouble ! Definition of open cover: Let $A$ be a subset in $X$. A family $\mathcal{U}=\{U_i: i\in I\}$ of subsets of $X$ is called a cover for $A$ is $A\subseteq \bigcup U_i$.
