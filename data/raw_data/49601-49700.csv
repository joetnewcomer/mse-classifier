But how can I do $\sqrt{\ln(1)}+\sqrt{\ln(2)}+\sqrt{\ln(3)}+\cdots$?,"This is also related to an older thread in MSE ("" what is the half derivative of zeta at zero? "") . One of the possible steps in the problem of that thread was to evaluate the series $$s_a=\eta^{(0.5)}(0) = Ã® \small{\left(\sqrt{\ln(1)}-\sqrt{\ln(2)}+\sqrt{\ln(3)}-\sqrt{\ln(4)} \cdots \right) \underset{\mathfrak E}{\approx}} - 0.347006596200 \, Ã® $$ as the (regularized by Euler-summation $\mathfrak E$) value for the half-derivative of the alternating zeta (or ""Dirichlet's eta""). Note, that the additional imaginary factor $Ã®$ is due to the fact, that we had originally negative values under the square-root terms. In the following I'll leave this factor out for convenience. Q: But how can I do the nonalternating series $$ s_p=\zeta^{(0.5)}(0)= Ã® \small{ \left( \sqrt{\ln(1)}+\sqrt{\ln(2)}+\sqrt{\ln(3)}+\sqrt{\ln(4)}+ \cdots \right)} \underset{\mathfrak ???}{\approx} ??? $$ 
$\qquad \qquad$ I don't see so far any possibility for instance in the sense of L. Euler's famous $\eta() \to \zeta() $ - conversion. [update] : what I've additionally just done was to apply a procedure to find the/a formal power series for the problem of finite sums of consecutive terms. The procedure is that of the approximation of the Neumann-series of the Carleman-matrix for the function $f(x) = \sqrt{\ln(\exp(x^2)+1)}$ which is the iterative transfer function which produces the term of the series for index $n+1$ from the term at index $n$. I'll explain this now in more detail: For the procedure which is also known with the name ""indefinite summation"" we need first a function, which generates the terms of the series to be summed as iterates of itself. What function can transfer $\sqrt{\ln(x)}$ to $\sqrt{\ln(x+1)}$? This is $f(x)$ as given above, because for instance it gives for $z= \sqrt{\ln(5)}$ the result $f( z) = \sqrt{\ln(6)}$ and $fÂ°^2( z) = \sqrt{\ln(7)}$ and so on. So we can formally write the series $$ s_p  =Ã® \cdot ( z + f(z) + fÂ°^2(z) + fÂ°^3(z) + ... ) \qquad \qquad \text{ with } z=\sqrt{\ln(1)}=0 $$
An approach which I've exercised a couple of times is to implement $f()$ by a Carlemanmatrix based on $f()$'s formal powerseries. That powerseries is
$$ \mathcal {\text{Taylor}} (f(x)) \approx \small  0.83255461 + 0.30028060 x^2 + 0.020918484 x^4 - 0.0075447481 x^6  + ... $$ Let now $ C = \text{carleman}(f) $ be the Carlemanmatrix for $f(x)$ then the dotproduct of a vector $V(x)=[1,x,x^2,x^3,x^4,...]$ with $C$ gives $V(x) \cdot C= V(f(x))$ by definition, and if we look at the second column of $C$ only we have $V(x) \cdot C_{0..\infty,1} = f(x)$ at least as formal powerseries, and if it is convergent for small $x$ we can also evaluate numerically. Now the idea of the Neumann-series comes into play. As $V(x) \cdot C_{0..\infty,1} = f(x)$ we should formally also have $V(x) \cdot C^2_{0..\infty,1} = fÂ°^2(x)$,  $V(x) \cdot C^3_{0..\infty,1} = fÂ°^3(x)$ and so on, such that we make the ansatz:
$$ V(z) \cdot ( C^0 + C^1 + C^2 + C^3 + ... )_{0..\infty,1} \overset?= z + fÂ°(z) + fÂ°^2(z) + fÂ°^3(z) + ... $$
and the key-observation is here, that we have in the parenthese of the lhs the geometric series of the matrix $C$ (such a construct is also called ""Neumann-series""). We can surely expect, that this is no proper sum, but with some examples of alternating geometric series instead I could get meaningful approximations when using empirical approximations to $B = (I+C)^{-1}$ and then approximate for instance $V(z) \underset{\mathfrak E}\cdot B_{0..\infty,1} \approx z - f(z) + fÂ°^2(z) - ... + ...$ where $\mathfrak E$ means Eulersummation in the dotproduct if needed. This is not so simple and straightforward for the non-alternating geometric series. As the Carlemanmatrix of any function has the eigenvalue $1$ (at least once) by construction we would run into $\frac 10$ and cannot immediately try the approximation with finitely truncated matrices $A = ( I - C)^{-1}$. One of the workarounds, which gives sometimes meaningful results is, to omit the first column of $(I - C)$ which gives then some result, but where the first row is then systematically missing/unknown. Remark: a case where this workaround is successful is the problem of the sum-of-like-powers where the Carlemanmatrix is the upper-triangular Pascalmatrix $P$ . The removal of the empty first column in $ Q = (I - P)_{0..(n-1),1..n} $ allows inversion and provides the matrix $Q^{-1}$ of coefficients, with which Faulhaber had solved the summing-of-like-powers-problem. The same ansatz was also tried as far as I know by two authors for solving the extension of tetration to real iteration heights. I've similarly attempted some other series-problems with such ""iteration-series"" of iterated functions $fÂ°^h(x)$ and their according Neumann-series with meaningful approximations So I've now tested $_n Q = (I - C)_{0..n-1,1..n}$ with increasing $n$ and computed $\,_nA^* = \,_n Q^{-1} $ and made $\,_nA$ by inserting the unknown first row in $\,_nA^*$ 
The top-left of the heuristically approximated matrix $\,_nA$ is $$\small \,_nA_{0..16,0..1}=\begin{bmatrix}

Using the coefficients of the first column for a power series in $x$ building the function $a_0(x)$ we get
$$ a_0( \sqrt{\ln(n_1)})-a_0( \sqrt{\ln(n_2)}) = n_2 - n_1 $$
which indicates the sum of the $(fÂ°^k(n_1))^0$ - and which is just counting the terms. Using the coefficients $a_{k,1}$ of the second column for a power series in $x$ building the function $a_1(x)$ we get the finite sum of the function at consecutive arguments:
$$ a_1( \sqrt{\ln(n_1)})-a_1( \sqrt{\ln(n_2)}) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty  (\sqrt{\ln(n_1)}^k - \sqrt{\ln(n_2)}^k )a_{k,1}  = \sum_{k=n_1}^{n_2-1} \sqrt{\ln (k)}  $$
which indicates the sum of the $fÂ°^k(n_1)$ which is the desired finite sums $s_p$ for  the required terms to a very good (and seemingly arbitrary) numerical approximation. ------ End of lengthy explanation Q: However - I'm missing the first coefficient for the second power series $a_1(x)$ .

506178,How do we find non-self-adjoint A and unitary U such that exp(iA) = U?,"The following is a theorem: If $A$ is a self-adjoint matrix (i.e. $A^\dagger = A$), then $U = e^{iA}$ is a unitary matrix. This is easy to prove: $(e^{iA})^\dagger = e^{-iA^\dagger} = e^{-iA}$, with the last step a consequence of self-adjointness of $A$. Since powers of matrices commute with themselves, $e^{iA}$ commutes with $e^{-iA}$, and so we can write $e^{iA}e^{-iA}=e^{iA-iA}=e^{0}=I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. This shows that $(e^{iA})^{-1}=(e^{iA})^\dagger$, and hence that $e^{iA}$ is unitary. This is all well and good. However, the following (the converse) is not a theorem: If $U$ is a unitary matrix, then the (a?) matrix $A$ defined by $e^{iA} = U$ is self-adjoint. I have been led to believe that the best way to disprove this is by counterexample, but I have no idea how to construct a non-self-adjoint matrix $A$ for which $e^{iA}$ is still unitary. An explicit counterexample would be great, but an approach to figuring out how to find a counterexample would be even beter.",['linear-algebra']

In starting: Let P be a directed complete partially ordered set.  A subset $U$ of $P$ is said to be ""Scott open"" if it satisfies the following two conditions: U is an upper set: $\uparrow U= U$ if D is a directed set with $\bigvee D \in U$, then there is a $y \in D$ such that $(\uparrow y) \cap D \subseteq U$.

506256,"Prove that $\operatorname{Hom}_{\Bbb{Z}}(\Bbb{Q},\Bbb{Z}) = 0$ and show that $\Bbb{Q}$ is not a projective $\Bbb{Z}$-module.","1) Prove that $\operatorname{Hom}_{\Bbb{Z}}(\Bbb{Q},\Bbb{Z}) = 0$. 2) Show that $\Bbb{Q}$ is not a projective $\Bbb{Z}$-module. 1) We know that $\Bbb{Q}$ is an injective $\Bbb{Z}$-module. This implies that every short exact sequence $$0 \rightarrow \Bbb{Q} \xrightarrow{f} A \xrightarrow{g} B \rightarrow 0$$ is split exact. In particular, $$0 \rightarrow \Bbb{Q} \xrightarrow{f}  \Bbb{Z} \xrightarrow{g} A \rightarrow 0$$ is split exact. But this implies that we have a homomorphism $k: \Bbb{Z} \rightarrow \Bbb{Q}$  such that $kf = 1_{\Bbb{Q}}$. So we need to look at what possible homomorphisms we could have from $\Bbb{Z}$ to $\Bbb{Q}$. Since $\Bbb{Z}$ is cyclic, the homomorphism $k$ is determined by where it sends $1$. Suppose that we send $1$ to $q \in \Bbb{Q}$ such that $q \not= 1$ and $q \not= 0$. Let $m \in \Bbb{Z}$. Then $$k(m) = mk(1) = mq$$ But then $$qmq = k(1)k(m) \not= k(m) = mq$$ So either $1 \in \Bbb{Z}$ must be sent to $1 \in \Bbb{Q}$ or $k$ can be the trivial homomorphism. But if $1_{\Bbb{Z}}$ is sent to $1_{\Bbb{Q}}$, then $k$ must be the inclusion map. However in order to for $kf = 1_{\Bbb{Q}}$ to hold, $f$ must also sent $z$ to $z$ for all $z \in \Bbb{Q}$. But if that's the case, then for any $a/b \in \Bbb{Q}$ where $b \not= 0, 1$, we have (for $n \in \Bbb{Z}$) $$f(a/b) = n = f(n)$$ and this contradicts the fact that $f$ must be injective (since the sequence is exact). So the only possible $\Bbb{Z}$-module map from $\Bbb{Z}$ to $\Bbb{Q}$ is $0$. Do you think my answer is correct? 2) I was wondering if anybody could give a hint on this one, because I couldn't really get started.

Take two homogeneous polynomials $F(X,Y,Z)$ and $G(X,Y,Z)$, of order $N$ and $M$, respectively, and treat $X$ and $Y$ as constants for the moment. Then the resolvent will be equal to zero iff the two polynomials share a factor. But the resolvent is an homogeneous polynomial in two variables of order $M+N$, hence is a projectivisation of a one variable polynomial. If the field is algebraically closed then this gives us exactly $M+N$ projective solutions to res$(X,Y) = 0$, counting with multiplicity, call them $[X_i,Y_i]$. But then if we consider $F[X_i,Y_i,Z]$ and $G[X_i,Y_i,Z]$ and look to solve for $Z$ we can have up to $\max(M,N)$ solutions for each $i$.

Once it reaches halfway of that halfway is has halfway to go again.  Thus, there are an infinite number of half-ways!  Just to be concise, let me express my opinion of something that at least kinda sorta reaches for its resolution: $$\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^2}\,dx = 1. $$ (Note this could also be discussed in terms of a similar series solution, such as $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$, but actually trying to and resolving xeno's paradox is going way beyond the scope of this question.) But, the point of this is that an infinite pattern can lead to a finite result (such as the area under curve $1\over{X^2}$).  Now, look at the leftmost panel closely: If the third panel plots the location of Black ink in the image, as it says, it must plot itself in miniature.  This miniature, in turn, must include a plot of the comic; in this EXTRA-miniature plot, there must also be a plot of the comic, an infinite number of times. In other words, the third panel must plot itself and infinite number of times. Can it be shown that like the the amount of ink needed for these plots will so fast that a  thus that a finite amount of ink is needed to draw an infinite number of these ""reflected"" third panels? Let us try to compute the amount of ink recquired to draw this infinite number of self-mirrors. Amount of Ink $\bf \propto$ Surface  area of square We can assume this because the area covered by ink will be a fixed proportion of the squares area if the thickness of the the ink varies with the size of the square, which it obviously must or the image cannot be drawn! Let us say the sides of the small square are proportional (they must be if the plot is accurate) and that they are 1/5 the size of the first square.  Therefore both the surface area and the amount of ink used will be $\frac{1}{(5^n)^2}$ including the first square if n=0.  Now, let $A$ be the area of the first square.  We already know that $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{(5^n)^2} < (\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{\pi^2}{6})$$ therefore $A*(1 + \lim_{n \to +\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{(5^n)^2})$ must be a finite number. Thus an infinite number of panels can mathematically be drawn with a finite amount of ink! In other words, the added surface areas of a square, within a square, within a square, so on to infinity, is a finite combined area (remember the proof that the infinite series $\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges if $ p > 1$ - but I'll leave that to the reader.) Does this first differential equation still apply?  How would we unite these equations !? I will not comment on the second panel, but I think it may be similar to the first.....

If $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is lower semi-continuous, then $f$ is bounded from below and attains its infimum. I want to prove this. This is my proof: Since $X$ is compact then it follows that $f(X)$ is compact therefore it is closed and bounded (because $f(K)$ is in $\mathbb{R}$) and therefore $f$ has an infimum, $m = \inf f(x)$.
Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is compact by equivalence it is sequentially compact. There is a sub-sequence $(x_{n_k})$ of $(x_n)$ such that $f(x_{n_k})\rightarrow m \in\mathbb{R}$ since it is closed. Then by the lower semi-continuity of $f$ we have that
$$m = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\inf(x_n) =   \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\inf(x_{n_k})\geq f(x) \geq m. $$ Thus $$m\geq f(x) \geq m.$$
Hence $m = f(x)$. Therefore $f$ attains its minimum and is bounded below. (I did not assume $X$ was closed and bounded because it is not necessarily a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$).

506700,Is there some sort of correspondence between groups and partitions of a set?,"Every group action on a set $S$ partitions the set into orbits.  Conversely, for every partition of $S$ is there a group action such that the set of orbits of the group action equals the partition? My attempt.  Let $P = \{S_1,\dots, S_k\}$  be a partition of a finite set $S$ of order $n$.  Then there are elements of $G = Perm(S)$, the set of permutations of $S$, that leave each subset fixed, i.e. $g\in G$ such that $g\cdot S_i = \{gs : s\in S_i\} = S_i, \forall i$.  Think of the permutations that fix all of $S$ except permutes $S_i$ possibly in some nontrivial way.  If $g, h$ are such elements then $gS_i = S_i, \forall i$, so $g^{-1} S_i = S_i$, the action also being an action on the subsets.  Similarly $g\cdot h S_i = g S_i = S_i$.  Thus, the set of all $P$-stabilizing elements is a subgroup of $G$. Groups are known in correspondence with subgroups of $G$.  Please comment. Motivation: is there a group-theoretical way to count partitions of a set of size $n$?  So that maybe it can help prove formulas about the latter. According to m_l in a comment, there's no application here to counting partitions here that doesn't lead to having to count the partitions the known ways. I was thinking, we haven't considered yet, at least I haven't, the set of partitions of $S$ itself, call it $P(S)$, and the group $G = Perm(S)$ acting on it.  The nice thing about $G = Perm(S)$ is that every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of it.  So if $H \leqslant G$, and $H'$ is the group presented in some other way, then almost anything we say about $H$ can be applied to $H'$ regarding group actions on $S$ or $P(S)$.  Hopefully, so let's keep that in the back of our minds.  In other words, every partition corresponds to a partition of the set of subgroups of $G$.  But we should say more about it than that.  I'm moving off track here, so continuing on... Define the action of $G$ on $P(S), $ to be $g \cdot P = \cup_{i=|P|} \{ g\cdot S_i \}$, where $g\cdot S_i$ is the element $g$ acting on the block $S_i$ suing simple coset multpilcation.  Relatedly there's an obvious way to make $G$ act on the set of all subsets of $S$. Anyway.  As you can tell the action on $P(S)$ defines a group action.  Proof:
The identity permutation obviously fixes a partition.  And $g(h P) = g\cdot\cup_{i=1..|P|} \{ h\cdot S_i \}$.  Note that since $g$ acts on the set of subsets of $S$, $g(hP) = (gh)P. \ $  The rest of the proof is left to the reader. Let's switch notation a bit.  $P\in P(S)$ will now be called $p$, and $P(S)$ will be called $P$. An orbit is simply $O_p = G\cdot p \subset P(S)$.  We have the class equation $|P(S)| = \sum_{orbits} |O_p|$ Burnside's Lemma: # orbits $ = 1/|G| \sum_{g\in G}|P^g|, \ $ where $P^g$ is the set of all partitions fixed by $g$. and the index counting formula $|G| = |H_p||O_p| = |H_p|[G:H_p], \ $ where $H_p = Stab(p)$ is the stabilizer of the partition $p$.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'set-partition']"

506840,A query about countability,"Suppose we are working in an elementary  context where we want to keep background assumptions modest (not take a stand on fancy issues in set theory, say). What should our attitude be to the idea of countability? Countability is defined by a quantification â€“ $X$ are countable if there is a function $f \colon N \to X$ which enumerates them. But quantification over which functions? Even if you fully buy into a rich set-theoretic background, taken at face value, different set theories will supply different enumerating functions. Thus the so-called constructible reals are uncountable according to the theory â€˜ZFC + V = Lâ€™ but countable according to the theory â€˜ZFC + there exists a Ramsey cardinalâ€™. More needs to be said even by the orthodox who identify functions with sets, if it isnâ€™t to be left somewhat indeterminate what objects are countable.  But suppose we fall short of  endorsing the set-thereotic orthodoxy because we donâ€™t (in the context, anyway) want definitely to buy into the wildly infinitary assumptions of this or that set theory: then that leaves more indeterminacy in what counts as countable. (If we don't settle just which functions we are prepared to countenance, we leave it correspondingly open which enumerating functions we are aiming to quantify over when we say that some given objects are countable.) Yet mathematicians â€” at least when writing in fairly elementary contexts â€” cheerfully talk about the countable as if thatâ€™s unproblematic. How come? Is that just carelessness?? Or worse??? Well, elementary talk about the countable tends (doesnâ€™t it?) to feature  in three sorts of context: There are claims that certain objects are indeed countable, defended by showing that the objects in question are unproblematically counted by producing a nice enumerating function. (Consider, for a familiar simple example, how we show that the positive rationals $m/n$ are countable by actually constructing the â€˜zig-zagâ€™ enumerating function for ordered pairs $m, n$, and so counting them.) There are claims that certain objects are uncountable, defended by reducing the assumption that they can be counted to absurdity. (Consider, for another familiar simple example, the usual diagonal argument that the infinite binary sequences are uncountable.) There are conditional claims of the kind if X are countable, then ... , supported by general arguments that are insensitive to how exactly we delimit (or fail to delimit) the countable. (The second is a special case of the third, of course, but perhaps worth highlighting separately.) In none of these kinds of case, at any rate, does such indeterminacy as we might be leaving in the extent of the countable become problematic. So if we proceed with due caution â€“ restrict ourselves to these cases â€” we can continue to talk about the (un)countable safely enough. And in elementary contexts we do exercise such caution. So we are not in trouble after all. Or at least, so it seems. Query: is that a fair description of â€˜ordinaryâ€™ mathematical practice in elementary, non-set-theoretic, areas? If not, what is a better description of what is going on?

506855,The irreducibility of $x^p-a$ implies that of $x^{p^2}-a$,"Morandi's Field and Galois Theorey, exercise 10.5c Let $p$ be a prime, and suppose that either $F$ contains a primitive $p$ th root of unity for $p$ odd, or that $F$ contains a primitive fourth root for $p=2$ . If there is an $a\in F$ with $x^p-a$ irreducible over $F$ , then $x^{p^2}-a$ is irreducible over $F$ . (Hint: Use a norm argument) My efforts: suppose $\alpha^{p^2}-a=0$ , and let $K=F(\alpha),\beta=\alpha^p,L=F(\beta)$ Since $x^p-a$ is irreducible, we have $[L:F]=p$ . If $[K:L]=p$ , we have $[K:F]=p^2$ and therefore $x^{p^2}-a$ is irreducible, so we only need to show that $[K:L]=p$ , which is equivalent to the irreducibility of $x^p-\beta$ . Suppose not, since a $p$ th primitive root is contained in $L$ , we have $x^p-\beta$ splits in $L$ , which means that $\alpha\in L$ , therefore $\alpha$ is an $F$ -polynomial of $\beta$ . I don't know how to proceed. Any help? Thanks!","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
506860,Support of Convolution and Smoothing,"I just want to know how it follows that $v^{\epsilon} \in C^{\infty}(\bar{V})$? I could see how $v^{\epsilon} \in C^{\infty}(V)$ by using the translations, but I'm having difficulty seeing how it extends to $\bar{V}$, since it says that $u_{\epsilon}(x) := u(x^{\epsilon}) \text{ for } x \text{ in } V$, we are mollifying on $V$. I also don't think we can use the same type of extension as in the previous question I asked, since previously we extended a function that had already become zero to zero on the rest of the domain. Do you have any idea of how this follows? Thanks for the assistance.","['convolution', 'regularization', 'sobolev-spaces', 'partial-differential-equations', 'functional-analysis']"

506902,Rotation matrix convention; successive rotations in intermediate coordinate systems or not,"I am getting very confused about the different conventions used for rotation matrices. Thing is I want to accomplish (3) successive rotations each time in the newly defined coordinate system. I use this convention for a rotation matrix: $$R_{21} = \begin{bmatrix} \hat{u} & \hat{v} & \hat{w} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} u_x &v_x & w_x \\ u_y & v_y & w_y \\ u_z & v_z & w_z \\ \end{bmatrix}$$ Meaning that the x, y and z vector of the new $\underline{e}_2$ coordinate system are given column-wise . If I then define three successive rotations in the order $zyx$ / yaw pitch roll / $\psi \theta \varphi$ with: $$R(\psi) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\psi) & -\sin(\psi) & 0 \\ \sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\  \end{bmatrix}$$
$$R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \\ \end{bmatrix}$$
$$R(\varphi) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\varphi) & -\sin(\varphi)\\ 0 & \sin(\varphi) & \cos(\varphi) \\  \end{bmatrix}$$ Then I can calculate the final coordinate system $\underline{e}_4$ using: $$R_{41} = R(\varphi) R(\theta) R(\psi)$$ Unfortunately this results in each rotation around the initial coordinate system $\underline{e}_1$, which is what I do not want. I require $R(\psi)$ to rotate around the z axis of $\underline{e}_1$, $R(\theta)$ around the y axis of $\underline{e}_2$ and $R(\varphi)$ around the x axis of $\underline{e}_3$, together resulting in $\underline{e}_4$. I guess this has something to do with active/passive rotations (e.g. vector or coordinate system rotations). I achieve what I want by doing:
$$R_{41} = \left( R(\varphi)^T R(\theta)^T R(\psi)^T \right) ^T$$ But this is a rather ugly way, nor do I fully understand why this is correct. Who can explain me what happens? And who can recommend me a better approach? Second thing is pre-multiplication versus post-multiplication when dealing with column vectors and row-vectors (seen in the context of the above). How do I transform a column vector to $\underline{e}_4$ taken into account that each successive rotation has to be around the newly defined coordinate system? Similar for a row-vector. Is this correct (for a row vector):
$$\vec{w}_2 = \vec{w}_1 R_{41}^T$$
And for column vectors:
$$\vec{v}_2 = R_{41} \vec{v}_1$$ Thanks for your help in this!","['geometry', 'linear-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'rotations']"

506954,Showing limit does not exist using two-path test,"I am new to using two-path test and my textbook only discusses it without showing any examples. I attempted to do this question below but I am not sure if I am correct. The question says to show the limit doesn't exist as $(x,y) \to (0,0)$:
$$f(x,y)=\frac{xy}{|xy|}.$$ First I set $y=0$ and let $x \to 0$ and got the limit to be undefined
