Thanks for the explanations and I'd like to get help on another one. $(A \cap B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cap B)$. So for $(A \cap B)$, $x \in A \land x \in B$. And $x \in A$ and $ x \in B$ must be true.

971021,Whats wrong with this proof of Cayley-Hamilton,"There are a handful of longish proofs for Cayley-Hamilton, but I haven't seen one that goes along the following lines.  What's wrong in my thinking. Take a real square matrix $A$, with Jordan decomposition $D=Q^{-1}AQ$.  Call the eigenvalues of $A$ (and $D$) $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\dotsc,\lambda_k$, with respective algebraic multiplicities $n_1,n_2,\dotsc,n_k$.  Then $A$ has the characteristic polynomial:
$$\Delta(\lambda):=\det(\lambda I-A)=\prod_i(\lambda-\lambda_i)^{n_i}.$$
So,
$$\Delta(A)= \prod_i(A-\lambda_i)^{n_i}=Q\left(\prod_i(D-\lambda_i)^{n_i}\right)Q^{-1}.$$ The block(s) associated with $\lambda_i$ for the matrix $(D-\lambda_i)^{n_i}$ are nilpotent (for at least $n_i$ if not smaller) so $\prod_i(D-\lambda_i)^{n_i}=\mathbf{0}$ so $\Delta(A)=\mathbf{0}$.",['linear-algebra']

These homeormorphisms will obviously induce automorphisms of the group $\pi_1(T)$. But how do I show that all the automorphisms are induced this way?

971209,"Prove that $e^{t(X+Y)}=e^{tX} e^{tY}$ implies $[X,Y]=0$","I am currently reading about the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and in a textbook on Lie Algebras, he shows that if $$[X,[X,Y]] = 0 \quad \text{ and } [Y,[X,Y]] = 0$$ then $$e^{Xt}e^{Yt} = e^{Xt + Yt + \frac{t^{2}}{2}[X,Y]}.$$ where $[X,Y] = XY-YX$ and $X,Y$ are square matrices. I later read on wikipedia that if $$e^{X}e^{Y} = e^{(X+Y)},$$ this does not necessarily imply that $X$ and $Y$ commute, which leads me to believe that the converse of the result in the text is false. How do you prove/disprove the converse? It seems difficult and laborious to construct and verify a counterexample (and I'm not even sure the converse is false); I tried to differentiate $e^{Xt}e^{Yt} = e^{Xt+Yt + \frac{t^{2}}{2}[X,Y]}$ and evaluate at zero, but it quickly turned into a mess due to the complexity of the higher order derivatives. I then tried to prove the much easier $$e^{Xt}e^{Yt} = e^{(X+Y)t} \implies [X,Y] = 0$$ with the same technique (I hypothesized that if it can work with this statement, then it will work with the harder one after some effort), but I ended up with a collection of matrix products after the third derivative evaluated at zero that did not seem to help me at all. Edit: After some additional reading, I have found that $e^{X}e^{Y} = e^{(X+Y)} \implies [X,Y]=0$ is not true, but if $e^{Xt}e^{Yt} = e^{(X+Y)t}$ for all $t$, then this stronger statement will be true. This makes me suspect the converse I want to prove/disprove is true, but has put me no closer in actually proving it. Edit 2: After taking several higher order derivatives and evaluating at zero, I have been able to show that $[Y,[X,Y]] = 0$, but repeating this process again is becoming too difficult to compute by hand due to the large amount of nested commutators. I think there should be a way to use symmetry to use this result to conclude that $X$ must also commute with $[X,Y]$ here, but I don't know how to proceed.","['matrix-exponential', 'matrices', 'matrix-calculus', 'lie-algebras']"

971253,Is a path connected covering space of a path connected space always surjective?,"If $X$ is a path connected topological space, a covering space of $X$ is a space $\tilde{X}$ and a map $p:\tilde{X} \to X$ such that there exists an open cover $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}$ of $X$ where $p^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ is a disjoint union of homeomorphic open sets ($p$ being homeomorphism between them). Are there path connected covering spaces of a path connected $X$ which are not surjective? Why? Allen Hatcher's book 'Algebraic Topology' says the disjoint union of open sets mentioned may be empty/null in some cases (e.g. $X$ not path connected with $p$ the identity on a path component). I'm really asking if the path connectedness of the spaces can be used to show there is no 'folding'. For instance, if $X = \tilde X = [−1,1]$ and the covering map the absolute value. (This example is not a covering space as the preimage of any open set around 0 is bad. I hope this demonstrates my point though).","['general-topology', 'covering-spaces', 'algebraic-topology']"

971383,Difficulty understanding the solutions to $x'' = -\omega^2 x$,"For some reasons involving physics, I'm supposed to consider the equation $x'' = -\omega^2 x$. Normally, I would say the solutions are of the form $x = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$. But when $\omega = 0$, the equation degenerates to $x'' = 0$, which gives an entirely different set of solutions: $x = ct + d$. What stumps me is how these two cases aren't in the same form. No matter what I try to do to the cosine (splitting it as sin + cos, writing it as complex exponentials, etc), I can't seem to get it in a form where plugging in $\omega = 0$ gets me a linear solution. So my question is this: If I were to prove that the solutions of $x'' = -\omega^2 x$ were exactly those of the form $x = A \cos(\omega t + \phi)$, where and why would the case $\omega = 0$ be eliminated?

971758,Finding the Discriminant of $f(x)=x^n+ax+b$ Using Differentiation,"Greetings fellow Mathematics enthusiasts. I was hoping someone could offer me some advice on proving the following statement about the discriminant of a polynomial with degree $n$. Let $f(x)=x^n+ax+b$ be irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha$ a root of $f$, where $a,b\in \mathbb{Q}, a \neq 0, n \geq 2$. Prove that disc$(\alpha) = (-1)^\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\left( (-1)^{1-n}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n+n^nb^{n-1}\right)$.
My professor left us a hint that reads: Show that $f'(\alpha)= \frac{-((n-1)a \alpha+nb)}{\alpha}$. Now find $N((n-1)a \alpha+nb)$ by noticing that it is a root of $\left( \frac{x-nb}{(n-1)a}\right)^n + a\left( \frac{x-nb}{(n-1)a}\right)+b$.
This power-reducing technique was introduced in class to find the discriminant above, but with $n=3$. As for the Norm calculation, we are told to use the constant term of the minimal polynomial. Here is my work so far: Given $f'(\alpha)=\frac{-((n-1)a \alpha+nb)}{\alpha}$, let $\beta=(n-1)a\alpha+nb$. So we have $\alpha = \frac{\beta-nb}{(n-1)a}$. Back substituting into the original equation, $\left( \frac{\beta-nb}{(n-1)a}\right)^n + a\left(\frac{\beta-nb}{(n-1)a}\right) + b \Rightarrow
\left(\beta-nb \right)^n + \left((n-1)a\right)^n\frac{\beta-nb}{n-1} + \left((n-1)a\right)^nb=0$.
Upon simplifying a bit, we are left with $\left(\beta-nb\right)^n + \left((n-1)\right)^{n-1}a^n(\beta-nb)  + \left((n-1)a\right)^nb=0$. Using the Binomial Theorem, we expand the first term and obtain $\left[\beta^n-nb\beta^{n-1} + \ldots + (-nb)^n\right] + \left((n-1)\right)^{n-1}a^n(\beta-nb) + \left((n-1)a\right)^nb=0$.

However, the Law of large numbers says, that given enough repetitions a certain event will likely happen. To my understanding, these two kinda contradict each other because one says that you can not predict any random event but the other one says so (given enough repetitions of course). For example imagine a series of coin tosses where the coin comes up heads a million times. The Gambler's fallacy says that the chance for the next toss to be tails is still 1/2. However the law of large numbers says, that since enough repetitions of tosses have come up heads, the next toss is more likely to be tails.

971962,The meaning of a definition involving multiple sums with Bernoulli numbers,"Reading a paper regarding Bernoulli numbers, and I stumbled onto a definition.  First let
$$\frac{x}{e^x-1}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}B_k\frac{x^k}{k!}$$
The author then goes on to define new terms. Let
$$\beta_n=(-1)^n\frac{B_n}{n}, n\ge 1$$
noting that $\beta_n=B_n/n$ except for $\beta_1=-B_1=1/2$ since $B_n=0$ when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.  Now he defines
$$\beta_n^{(j)}=\frac1{j!}\sum_{i_1+i_2+...+i_j=n}\binom{n}{i_1,i_2,...,i_j}\beta_{i_1}...\beta_{i_1}$$
I'm not even sure where to start with this, but, I suppose I'm confused about the role of the bound $i_1+i_2+...+i_j=n.$  I would have to say that the sum of the $i_k$'s are integer partitions of a number $n$.  Should I take this as unique integers?  Or is this simply all possible integer partitions of $n$? So for $n=4$, so i take

These numbers are the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ elements into $k$ disjoint parts whose partition cardinality are greater than 1. If there isn't already an explicit formula, how I do go about attempting to derive such a thing? EDIT:
One thing that I do know is that 
$$b(n,j)=\sum_{k=0}^j(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}S(n-k,j-k)$$
where $S(n,k)$ are Stirling numbers of the second kind.  Therefore, I can say that 
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b(n,j)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\sum_{k=0}^j(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}S(n-k,j-k)\right)x^n$$
which is quite ugly.  I also know that the Stirling Numbers of the Second kind have the ordinary generating function
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty S(n,k)x^n=\frac{x^k}{(1-x)(1-2x)...(1-kx)}  $$
which I'm hoping to take advantage of after some brute force calculation... EDIT 2:  Aftr some brute force calculation, it appears that I have a series generated, that looks like
$$b(n,j)=\sum_{k=0}^j(-1)^k\binom{n}{k}S(n-k,j-k)$$
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b(n,j)x^n=b(0,j)+b(1,j)+b(2,j)+b(3,j)+b(4,j)+...$$
Now
$$b(0,j)=1$$
$$b(1,j)=S(1,j)$$
$$b(2,j)=S(2,j)-2S(1,j-1)$$
$$b(3,j)=S(3,j)-3S(2,j-1)$$
$$b(4,j)=S(4,j)-4S(3,j-1)+6S(2,j-2)$$
$$b(5,j)=S(5,j)-5S(4,j-1)+10S(3,j-2)$$
$$b(6,j)=S(6,j)-6S(5,j-1)+15S(4,j-2)-20(3,j-3)$$
$$b(7,j)=S(7,j)-7S(6,j-1)+21S(5,j-2)-35(4,j-3)$$
$$... $$
Rearranging I can see that I have
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty b(n,j)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty S(n,j)x^n-\sum_{n=1}^\infty nS(n-1,j-1)x^n+\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}S(n-2,j-2)x^n-\sum_{n=3}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}S(n-3,j-3)x^n+...$$
And it looks like a derivative is taking effect but my powers of $x$ are not changing, but it also looks like I'm running in circles.  I feel like my bounds are incorrect...Should, for example, I change
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty nS(n-1,j-1)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)S(n,j-1)x^{n+1}$$
$$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{n(n-1)}{2!}S(n-2,j-2)x^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2!}S(n,j-2)x^{n+2}$$
Any suggestions? EDIT 3:  By comparing the first few numbers given $j$ values 2,3,4, there seems to be a trend, the generating function is structured 
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b(n,j)x^n=\frac{f(x)}{\prod_{k=1}^{j}(1-kx)^{j-k+1}}$$
The degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator in the cases where $j=2,3,4$ and the ratios of degree(numerator) to degree(denominator) for $j=2,3,4$ are $$\frac{4}{3}, \frac{9}{6}, \frac{14}{10}$$ EDIT 4:  I found a paper that gives me an exponential generating function of the form: $$\sum_{n,k\ge 1}b(n,k)u^k\frac{t^n}{n!}=\exp{(u\exp{(1-Q(2,t)}})$$

The sup metric is $d_{\infty}(f,g) = \sup \left\{|f(x) - g(x)| : a \leq x \leq b \right\}$ for $f,g\in C[a,b]$ Clearly $C^1[a,b] \subset C[a,b]$ $C^1[a,b]$ is a closed subset of $C[a,b]$ if $C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ is open in $C[a,b]$ - i.e. $\forall h \in C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$, $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that $\left\{ f \in C[a,b] : d_{\infty}(f,h) < \epsilon \right\} \subseteq C[a,b]\backslash C^1[a,b]$ Which seems to be saying that, essentially, for any non-differentiable continuous function $h$ we can find an $\epsilon > 0$ such that when the supremum of the distance between $h$ and all other continuous functions on $[a,b]$ is less than $\epsilon$, then they will also not be differentiable. This is where I get stuck, not least because I'm not convinced whether that is true or not. Clearly, it's easily possible to create further non-differentiable functions by, for example, moving one point of $h$ less than $\epsilon$. My instinct is that you're not going to be able to turn a non-differentiable function into a differentiable one with an arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, so I think such an $\epsilon$ exists - but this obviously isn't formal (or even likely to be correct) Thanks.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces']"

Then there is some $\beta>0$ such that $$\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^n\quad\langle Ax,x\rangle\leq-\beta\|x\|^2.$$I think the claim is false , as can be shown by taking for example $$A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&-1\\1&-1\end{array}\right).$$The characteristic polynomial is $$f_A(x)=\left|\begin{array}{rr}x&1\\-1&x+1\end{array}\right|=x^2+x+1,$$and its roots are $$x=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{-3}}{2},$$so the real parts are negative. But taking $x=(1,0),$ $$\langle Ax,x\rangle=\langle(0,1),(1,0)\rangle=0,$$which shows that the above claim does not hold. My problem: This claim is used in the text to prove a theorem which seems to be well-known and important. I guess the proof is not totally wrong, therefore I suspect that the above claim can be modified and turn into a true one. This is the point where I'll be happy to hear any suggestions. Some ODE intuition: Consider the linear equation $$\frac{dy}{dt}=Ay.$$ Any solution is of the form $$y(t)=e^{tA}y_0,$$and if $A$'s eigenvalues all have negative real parts, it turns out that all the solutions get closer to $0$ as $t\to\infty$.

The solution is very simple using the Frechet filter $\mathcal{F}:=\{A: X\setminus A \text{ finite}\}$ and defining the measure on the ultrafilter $\mathfrak{U}$ containing $\mathcal{F}$, as follows $$m(A)=\begin{cases} 1& A\in \mathfrak{U}\\
0&A\notin \mathfrak{U} \end{cases}$$ For the following Lemma : Let $\mathfrak{U}$ be an ultrafilter of subsets of $X$ and let $m$ defined as above. Then $m$ is finitely additive on $2^X$. PF: It's clear that $\varnothing\notin \mathfrak{U}$, so $m(\varnothing)=0$. Let $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^N\subset 2^{X}$ and disjoint, and let $A$ be their union. We consider two cases: If all are not in $ \mathfrak{U}$, i.e, $X\setminus A_n\in \mathfrak{U}$ for $n\le N$. Thus $X\setminus A=\bigcap_{n\le N}X\setminus A_n\in \mathfrak{U}$, so $A\notin \mathfrak{U}$. Hence $m(A)=\sum_{n\le N}m(A_n)=0$ Now suppose that at least one is in $\mathfrak{U}$. Let $A_1\in \mathfrak{U}$, so all the other elements are not in $\mathfrak{U}$ since otherwise $\varnothing=A\cap A_i\in \mathfrak{U}$ for $i\not=1$. Since $A_1\subset A$ and $A_1\in \mathfrak{U}$,  $A\in\mathfrak{U}$. Thus $m(A)=\sum_{n\le N}m(A_n)=1$. $\Box$ Does someone know if there is hope of a constructive approach?

$$\int_0^1\frac{\ln^2(1+x)\,\ln^2x}xdx=\frac{\pi^2\,\zeta(3)}3-\frac{29\,\zeta(5)}8\tag3$$ $$\int_0^1\frac{\ln^3(1-x)\,\ln^2x}xdx=12\zeta^2(3)-\frac{23\pi^6}{1260}\tag4$$ \begin{align}
\int_0^1\frac{\ln^3(1+x)\,\ln^2x}{x^2}dx=&\,\frac{3\zeta(3)}2+2\pi^2\zeta(3)+\frac{3\zeta(5)}2-\frac{21\zeta(3)}2\ln^22\\&\,-\frac{63\zeta(3)}2\ln2+\frac{23\pi^4}{60}-\frac{4\ln^52}5-\frac{3\ln^42}2\\&\,-4\ln^32+\frac{2\pi^2}3\ln^32+\frac{3\pi^2}2\ln^22-24\operatorname{Li}_5\!\left(\tfrac12\right)\\&\,-36\operatorname{Li}_4\!\left(\tfrac12\right)-24\operatorname{Li}_4\!\left(\tfrac12\right)\ln2\tag5

Show that the common tangents to circles $x^2+y^2+2x=0$ and $x^2+y^2-6x=0$ form an equilateral triangle. Solution : Let $C_1 : x^2+y^2+2x=0$ here centre of the circle is $(-1,0) $ and radius 1 unit. $C_2:x^2+y^2-6x=0$ here centre of the circle is $(3,0) $ and radius 3 units. But how to proceed to prove that the tangents form equilateral triangle please suggest thanks.","['geometry', 'circles']"
