168004,Product norm on infinite product space,"Today I proved that if $V$ is a normed space with norm $\|\cdot\|$ then I can define a norm on $V \times V$ that induces the same topology as the product topology as follows: $\| (v,w) \|_{V \times V} = \|v\| + \|w\|$. I think I can do the same for an infinite product $V^{\mathbb N}$ by defining $\|(v_n)\|_{\mathbb N} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \|v_n\|$ and I proved it using the proof of the case $V \times V$ and changing some minor things. Can you confirm that this result is correct? Thanks.","['normed-spaces', 'real-analysis']"
168023,Am I allowed to realize one object twice within one set-theory?,"Say I consider a set theory with the Axioms of Extensionality and the Axiom of Pairing. As I understand it, stating the axiom allows me to make a definition like $$(a,b):=\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$$ and work with that $(a,b)$ in the context of my theory. Pairing says ""it exists"" (I can write it down with my language) and Extensionality says the abstract idea of it is unique as a set. Is that way of thinking correct? Is that the purpose? Because (if I know $a$ and $b$ exists and since I know what set brackets are) in a way I feel the set $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$ existed already before the existence of a pair was guaranteed by the axiom - the possibility of nesting of sets as for the definition seems to be apriori to me, I asked a related question here . Secondly, since there are more set-constructions of the ordered pair , like say $$(a,b)':=\{b,\{a,b\}\}$$ as an alternative, I wonder: Am I allowed to realize the ordered pair twice in one theory? Then I could for example put ordered pairs as elements of ordered pairs of the second type and so on. Is there really only one realization of the ordered pair in say ZFC or are there in fact all thinkable versions in the theory and we just choose one if we prove stuff about the abstract thing (which implies that the statements are true for all models)? Or another idea: Should I view the whole thing in a way that I only define the thing using a concrete relization so that I can prove stuff about the ""actual"" abstract object, which is really only implicitly postulated to exist in the axiom. 
If that point of view ist true then I don't really see what the real difference of two realizations can be.","['axioms', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"

168034,Set of finite subsets as vector space: Double dual?,"Some problem I've found while thinking about duals of vector spaces: Be $S$ an arbitrary set. Denote by $F(S)$ the set of finite subsets of $S$, and by $P(S)$ its power set. Now it is easy to see that $F(S)$ forms a vector space over $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ if you define vector addition as symmetric difference and multiplication with scalar by the simple relations $0A=\emptyset$ and $1A=A$. A particular basis of that vector space is $\{\{s\}: s\in S\}$. From that, it is also easy to construct the dual space $F(S)^*$: Its members are simply given by the elements of $P(S)$ with the following application rule: If $\alpha\in P(S)$ and $v\in F(S)$, then $$\alpha(v) = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if $\alpha\cap v$ has an odd number of elements}\\0 & \text{if $\alpha\cap v$ has an even number of elements}\end{cases}$$ (or simply, express the number of elements in $\alpha\cup v$ in $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. It is also not hard to show that vector addition in $F(S)^*$ is again the symmetric difference. So one can say that, given the application rule above, $F(S)^* = P(S)$ Note that for finite $S$, $F(S)=P(S)$, while for infinite $S$, $F(S)$ is smaller than $P(S)$. So far, so good. However, what about the double-dual $F(S)^{**} = P(S)^*$? Since for finite $S$, $P(S)=F(S)$, one would conclude that the very same construction works again. However for infinite $S$, it cannot work, because you cannot say whether an infinite set has an even or odd number of elements. Also, $P(S)$ already contains all subsets of $S$, and as far as I understand, $P(S)^*$ should then be larger than $P(S)$. Therefore my question: Does there exist a simple representation of $F(S)^{**}=P(S)^*$, and if so, what does it look like? Ideally one should easily see the equivalence to $F(S)$ in the case of finite $S$.",['linear-algebra']

168113,How can I properly isolate the variables for this differential equation?,"I'm attempting to solve a problem involving this differential equation: $$\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2y^2 + x^2 - y^2 - 1$$ Because this is a separable differential equation, I tend to split the equation between variables $x$ and $y$, and integrate both sites; but I can't seem to get them separated, due to the $x^2y^2$. $$\frac{dy}{dx} + y^2 = x^2y^2 + x^2 - 1$$
$$ dy + y^2 = x^2y^2\space dx + x^2\space dx - dx$$ Now the only $y$ variable left to get on the opposite side is the $y^2$ that's trapped in $x^2y^2$, but extracting $y^2$ would leave a $y^2$ variable in all the other terms. That's sort of the problem. $$\frac{dy + y^2}{y^2} = x^2 dx + \frac{x^2}{y^2} dx - \frac{dx}{y^2}$$
$$\frac{dy}{y^2} + 1 = x^2 dx + \frac{x^2}{y^2} dx - \frac{dx}{y^2}$$ And now, if I want the $y$ variables out of the left side, I end up to the previous equation. $$ dy + y^2 = x^2y^2\space dx + x^2\space dx - dx$$ It's a really bad loop I'm in right now.

I have outlined my solution below in case there is a mistake I have overseen. I rewrite the differential equation piecewise and solve each piece independently. $y'=x$ for $x\ge0$ $y'=-x$ for $x<0$ This yields, $y_1=\frac{1}{2}x^2+c_1$ for $x\ge0$ $y_2=-\frac{1}{2}x^2+c_2$ for $x<0$ I use the initial condition to solve for $c_2$ and get, $y_2=-\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{5}{2}$ for $x<0$ Does this mean that the solution is only $y_2$?  I am thinking that if possible we want to find $c_1$ such that the solution is continuous and differentiable for the largest possible interval of definition.  If $c_1=c_2$ then the piecewise solution is continuous and differentiable for all reals and satisfies the initial condition.

The book I am reading calculates this using a previously shown identity that: $$F\left(\left.{1-c-2n,-2n \atop c}\right|-1\right)=(-1)^{n}\frac{(2n)!}{n!}\frac{(c-1)!}{(c+n-1)!},\space\forall n\in\mathbb{Z}^{*}$$ And then, the more general Kummer's Formula: $$F\left(\left.{a,b \atop 1+b-a}\right|-1\right)=\frac{(b/2)!}{b!}(b-a)^{\underline{b/2}}$$ It then shows that they would only produce consistent results if: $$(-1)^{n}\frac{(2n)!}{n!}=\lim_{b\to-2n}{\frac{(b/2)!}{b!}}=\lim_{x\to-n}{\frac{x!}{(2x)!}},\space n\in\mathbb{Z}^{*}$$ It then gives the example of $n=3$, proving that: $$\lim_{x\to-3}{\frac{x!}{(2x)!}}=-\frac{6!}{3!}=-120$$ However, using Wolfram|Alpha, I can see that there are other such limits defined (such as $\lim_{x\to-3}{\frac{x!}{(8x)!}}=-103408066955539906560000$.

168307,Generalized PNT in limit as numbers get large,"If $\pi_k(n)$ is the cardinality of numbers with k prime factors (repetitions included) less than or equal n, the generalized Prime Number Theorem (GPNT) is: $$\pi_k(n)\sim \frac{n}{\ln n} \frac{(\ln \ln n)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}.$$ The qualitative appearance of the actual distribution of $\pi_k(n)$ for k = 1,2,3,..., agrees very well with the GPNT, for numbers $n$ within reach of my laptop. But I noticed that as $n$ and $k$ get large, ""most"" of the numbers less than $n$ seem to have relatively few factors. Writing $n = 2^m$ and replacing $k$ by $x$ we can graph $$f(x) =\frac{2^m (\ln\ln 2^m)^{x-1}}{\ln 2^m (x-1)!}$$ from $x = 1$ to $m$ (since no number will have more than m factors) and see that for relatively small fixed $m$, most of the area under the curve f is is contained in a steep bell-shaped curve on the far left of the image. I take this to suggest that as we consider very large sets, $S_m = \{ 1,2,3,...,2^m\},$ almost all elements of these sets have a ""very small"" number of factors (including repetitions).

168334,Is this conjecture on Fibonacci sums correct?,"I have the following conjecture, need to know a proof just in case mine is wrong, or the conjecture itself is wrong. The sum of $k$ distinct Fibonacci numbers can be written in at most $k$ ways as the sum of another $k$ distinct numbers from the sequence Proof: Take, say 4, Fibonacci numbers with distinct values: $$144+34+3+2$$
We can see that we must maintain the distinctness and number of the Fibonacci numbers. So when we split the numbers; $$[89+55]+[13+21]+3+2$$ It is immediately apparent that if some numbers are split into smaller Fibonacci numbers, others must be merged to keep only 4 numbers.

Thus, $$144+34+3+2=89+55+34+5=144+21+13+5$$ I know it's a rudimentary proof, and $k$ ways of writing the same sum is probably a wrong upper bound, but at least it works for now.

168448,"Two different characterization of ""differentiable function""","In a calculus class we were given the following definition of ""differentiable function"" (working with 2 variables): Definition : Let $A \in \mathbb{R^2}$, and $f : A \to \mathbb{R}$. We say that $f$ is differentiable in $(x_0, y_0) \in A$ if the graph of $f$ admits a tanget plane at $(x_0, y_0, f(x_0, y_0))$. Then the teacher gave us the following equivalent characterization: Proposition : $f$ is differentiable in $(x_0, y_0)$ iff 1) $f$ admits partial derivatives in $(x_0, y_0)$ 2) the following holds:
$$
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0, y_0)} \frac{f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0) - A(x-x_0) - B(y-y_0)}{\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2}} = 0
$$
where 
$$A = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)$$
$$B = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)$$
i.e. the partial derivatives evaluated in $(x_0,y_0)$ Unluckily, I was not able to find any reference about this. So here's my questions: I got it right? Are the two definitions equivalents? How to prove that the limit is zero iff the function admits a tangent plane? Isn't (2) quite obvious? If a tangent plane at $P$ exists, its equation has to be $$f(x,y) = f(P) - \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(P)(x-x_P) - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(P)(y-y_P)$$
follow that the numerator of the limit is zero. So what's the point of the denominator? Couldn't one use anything else for the denominator? Am I missing something? Is (2) noteworthy?

168564,RSA public key cryptosystem,"I got stuck on a homework question. If anyone could help me with this certain problem, I would be grateful. I'll state what the problem say and some relevant theorem (i believe) that I used to partly prove the problem. Problem: A decryption exponent for an RSA public key $(N,e)$ is an integer $d$ with the property that $a^{de} \equiv a \mod N$ for all integers $a$ such that $\gcd(a,N) = 1$. Note that $N = pq$ but $p,q$ is unknown where $p,q$ are distinct primes and $e$ is the encryption exponent. Suppose I can find a decryption exponent for a given $(N,e)$ where $N$ is a fixed modulus and for a large number $e$ that is not $N$. How can I factor $N$? Attempt: According to the RSA public key cryptosystem, primes $p$, $q$ are picked such that they are distinct and an encryption exponent $e$ is chosen such that $\gcd(e, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1$. So here's what I did: Suppose that I am given two public keys with both public keys having the same modulus, so I have $(N, e_1)$ and $(N,e_2)$. By hypothesis, I can find $d_1$ and $d_2$ such that $e_1d_1 \equiv 1 \mod (p-1)(q-1)$ and $e_2d_2 \equiv 1 \mod (p-1)(q-1)$. By definition of congruences, there exists $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $e_1d_1 - 1 = k_1[(p-1)(q-1)]$ and $e_2d_2 - 1 = k_2[(p-1)(q-1)]$. Then I took the $\gcd(e_1d_1-1,e_2d_2 -1) = \gcd(k_1,k_2)[(p-1)(q-1)]$. Consider the case when $\gcd(k_1,k_2) = 1$. Then we found the value of $(p-1)(q-1)$, so $(p-1)(q-1) = pq - (p+q) + 1 = N - (p+q) + 1$. This implies that $(p+q) = N + 1 - (p-1)(q-1)$. So we use the quadratic formula to solve $X^2 - (p+q)X + N$ since this equation equals $(X-q)(X-p)$. Hence, I found the factors of $N$. But if the case that $\gcd(k_1,k_2) > 1$ seems to got me stuck. If anyone can help me with this by providing a way to think about this problem, that'll be great.","['cryptography', 'number-theory']"
168566,stopped filtration = filtration generated by stopped process?,"I am interested in a proof of the following statement which seems intuitive, but is somehow really tricky: Let $X$ be a stochastic process and let $(\mathcal{F}(t) : t \geq 0)$ be the filtration that it generates (unaugmented). Let $T$ be a bounded stopping time. Then we have
$\mathcal{F}(T) = \sigma(X(T \wedge t) : t \geq 0)$ I have a proof at hand (Bain and Crisan, Fundamentals of Stochastic Filtering, page 309), but in my opinion there is a major gap. I will try to explain the idea of proof. Let $V$ be the space of functions $[0,\infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ equipped with the sigma algebra generated by the cylinder sets. Consider the canonical map $X^T:\Omega \rightarrow V$ which maps $\omega$ to the trajectory $t \mapsto X(t \wedge T(\omega),\omega)$. Then we have $\sigma(X(T \wedge t) : t \geq 0) = \sigma(X^T)$. The difficult part is $\subseteq$. Let $A \in \mathcal{F}(T)$. We want to find a measurable map $g:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $1_A = g \circ X^T$, then we're done. It is now straightforward to show that $1_A$ is constant on sets where the sample paths of $X^T$ are constant. (To be more precise: for $\rho \in \Omega$ consider the set $\mathcal{M}(\rho) = \lbrace \omega : X(\omega,t) = X(\rho,t), 0 \leq t \leq T(\rho) \rbrace$. Then $T$ and $1_A$ are constant on every set of this form). The problem is: this is not sufficient! It suffices to construct a map $g$ such that $1_A = g \circ X^T$, but how we can we know that $g$ is measurable? This is where the proof of Bain and Crisan comes up short IMO. I can show this result only under the assumption that the map $X:\Omega \rightarrow V$ be surjective: Since $A \in \mathcal{F}(\infty)$, we have a measurable map $g$ such that $1_A = g \circ X$. Let $x \in V$. Then $T$ and $1_A$ are constant on the preimage of $x$ under $X$. Therefore, $g(x)$ does not depend on the values of $x$ after time $T$ (which is constant on the preimage of $x$). Since $X$ is surjective, we have $g(x) = g(K^Tx)$, where $K$ is the killing functional $K^tx(s) = x(t \wedge s)$. Hence, $g \circ X = g \circ X^T$, and we are done. I think that this result could be a little bit deeper. I have seen two proofs of this for the special case that $X$ is the coordinate process on $C[0,\infty)$, one is given in the book of Karatzas & Shreve, Lemma 5.4.18. The fact that Karatzas proves this late in the book only in this special case somehow makes me think that the general case is not so easy. I would really appreciate any comment or other reference for this result.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory', 'probability']"

For an example in which exhaustion is impossible, consider the real line with the co-countable topology. If $U\subsetneq \mathbb{R}$ is open, and if $F_n$ is a non-empty closed set, we have that necessarily $F_{n+1}$ contains a non-empty open set, is closed, and hence must be $\mathbb{R}$.

168754,Is it possible to capture a light ray in a solar panel?,"A while ago I was wondering how we could use mathematics to increase the efficiency of solar panels. The kind of mathematics I was thinking about in particular was Dynamical Billiards . Though I think it is improbable that it is currently technologically feasible to create the solar panel I am thinking about, I guess the following question could be interesting from a mathematical point of view. We first need some definitions: An $(k+l)$ -setting is a collection of two sets of points in $\mathbb{R^d}$ , $\{n_1,...,n_k \}, \{m_1,...,m_l \}$ such that each of the points $m_i \in \{m_1,...,m_{l-1} \}$ is connected with the point $m_{i+1}$ , by some continuous function (the continuous function may differ for each pair of points $(m_i,m_{i+1})$ ). For example, this is an $(k+l)$ -setting in $\mathbb{R^2}$ : I hope it's somewhat readable. In this case, we have $k=2$ and $l=5$ . Furthermore, we say that a $(k+l)$ -setting is good , if it is possible create a circle, such that the points $m_1,...,m_l$ are in the circle, but the points $n_1,...,n_k$ are not in the circle. If a $(k+l)$ -setting isn't good , it's bad . For example: Please notice that the first example of a $(k+l)$ -setting is bad . No matter how you draw the circle, the point $n_2$ is always contained in it. Now, the point of these definitions is that I would like to launch a light rays from the the points $n_1,...,n_k$ , that bounces against the continuous functions. These continuous functions act as a mirror, causing the light ray to reflect according to the laws of reflection . We assume that the light ray loses no energy with each reflection, thereby maintaining its intensity on it whole course. The continuous functions that act as a boundary of the ""solar panel"" aren't affected by a reflection either. Question 1: Does there exist a good $(1+l)$ -setting in $\mathbb{R^2}$ , such that we can send a light ray from point $n_1$ into the circle that encloses the points $m_1,...,m_l$ , in such a way that the light ray never leaves the circle? If you can answer the question in the affirmative, I have a number of follow-up questions: Question 2.1: If there exists such a setting, how is it visualised? Question 2.2: What about the case $k>1$ ? Question 2.3: What about the case $d>2$ ? If you answer the question in the negative, I also have some follow-up questions: Question 3.1: Why does such a setting not exist? Can you prove it cannot exist? Question 3.2: What if $d>2$ ? Please notice that, when $d=3$ , the continuous functions between the points become continuous surfaces, and when $d=4$ , they become volumes, etc. By the way, it would be great if someone told me how I could center the images, or places them in the middle themselves.","['dynamical-systems', 'geometry', 'euclidean-geometry']"

Since $char(\mathbb{Q})=0$ then $\mathbb{Q}$ is perfect hence every field extension is separable, in particular $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}},\sqrt{p_{2}},\ldots,\sqrt{p_{n}})/\mathbb{Q}$ is separable. Since $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}},\sqrt{p_{2}},\ldots,\sqrt{p_{n}})/\mathbb{Q}$ is a finite and separable field extension, by the primitive element theorem, it holds that there exist $\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}},\sqrt{p_{2}},\ldots,\sqrt{p_{n}})$ s.t $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}},\sqrt{p_{2}},\ldots,\sqrt{p_{n}})$.

& =(\sqrt{p_{1}}+\cdots+\sqrt{p_{n-1}})^{2}-p_{n}

$$ If $n=2$ then this product is in $\mathbb{Q}$ hence in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}}+\sqrt{p_{2}})$ hence 
$\sqrt{p_{1}}-\sqrt{p_{2}}\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}}+\sqrt{p_{2}})$ so adding we get $\sqrt{p_1}\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1}+\sqrt{p_2})$ hence $\sqrt{p_2}\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_1}+\sqrt{p_2})$ and we have proven $(2)$ So the reason I fail here is that I can't manage to show $$\sqrt{p_{1}}+\sqrt{p_{2}}-\sqrt{p_{n}}\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p_{1}}+\sqrt{p_{2}}+\sqrt{p_{n}}).$$ Can someone please help me find a primitive element, or help complete the proof I am trying to do here ? help is very much appriciated!","['abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

Since it is a normal subgroup, I know the group of deck transformations of my covering space is naturally isomorphic to the subgroup itself. Supposing that $N$ is finitely generated, I would like to lift its generating loops to the covering space, I will get, because of the infinite-index, loops starting at all the fibers of my base point.

Claim: $C_0(X)$ is a closed subspace of $C_b(X)$ Proof: We have to show that $C_0(X)$ contains all of its limit points. Let $f(x)$ be a limit point of it, then we have a sequence $f_n$ converging to it (in $\|\cdot\|_\infty$) hence $f_n$ is a Cauchy sequence (with respect to $\|\cdot\|_\infty$). Of course, $f$ is continuous since it's the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions. So we only have to show that $f(x)$ vanishes at $\pm \infty$ (apparently, $X \subset \mathbb R$? See here for a definition of $C_0(X)$. I'd have thought it's more general but then what does $x \to \infty$ mean in a general topological space?) Let $\varepsilon>0$.
