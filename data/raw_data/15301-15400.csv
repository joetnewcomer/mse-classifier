122400,Why were filters and nets in topology named filters and nets?,"I am wondering why do mathematicians categorizes some structures and called them filters , Nets ? In English, filter means: A porous material through which a liquid or gas is passed in order to separate the fluid from suspended particulate matter. Is this meaning of filter correspond to that of mathematics? What is the reason behind calling filter as filter in maths? Is their any reason for naming Nets (the structure) as Nets?

122414,"Isomorphism of direct sums $R/a \oplus R/b \cong R/{\rm lcm}(a,b)\oplus R/\gcd(a,b)$","So I basically have to prove the following. If $a,b\in R$ non-zero, with $R$ a PID. Then we want to show $$R/aR\oplus R/bR\cong R/cR\oplus R/dR$$ Where $c$ is the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ , and $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ . Here is my proof: Since $R$ is a PID it is also a UFD, so let $$a=u_1p_1^{\alpha_1}...p_n^{\alpha_n}$$ $$b=u_2p_1^{\beta_1}...p_n^{\beta_n}$$ where $u_i$ are units, and some of the $\alpha$ 's or $\beta$ 's might be zero, but it is written this way for a later convinience. By the chinese remainder theorem we have that $R/aR\cong R/p_1^{\alpha_1}R\oplus...\oplus R/p_n^{\alpha_n}R$ . I do the same with $R/bR$ , and then I have $$R/aR\oplus R/bR\cong  R/p_1^{\alpha_1}R\oplus...\oplus R/p_n^{\alpha_n}R\oplus R/p_1^{\beta_1}R\oplus...\oplus R/p_n^{\beta_n}R$$ Then for a given if $\alpha_i<\beta_i$ , then I interchange the summands of $R/p_i^{\alpha_i}R$ and $R/p_i^{\beta_i}R$ . I basically write the high exponents in the front and the low exponents in the back. The combination of the low exponents furnishes the gcd, and the combination of the high exponents yields the lcm. I was wondering if there is an easier way (which probably there is, I am somewhat tired) that gives an explicit map. Thanks.","['principal-ideal-domains', 'abstract-algebra']"

122552,Equivalence of quadratic forms over p-adic fields.,"There is a theorem that states that two quadratic forms over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are equivalent iff they have the same rank, discriminant and the same $\epsilon$ invariant. (The last is defined as follows: if $f = \sum_{i=1}^n a_ix_i^2$ then $\epsilon(f) = \prod_{1\le i < j \le n} (a_i,a_j)$, where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the Hilbert symbol over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.) The proof (from Serre's Arithmetic) is based on a previous theorem, which relates these invariants to the elements the forms represent. However, I do not know how I can show that two particular forms are equivalent (with the same invariants of course). So fix some prime $p$ and consider the following two forms over $\mathbb{Q}_p$: \begin{equation}
f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 - (x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2) \nonumber

122575,Covariant Derivatives and the Cross Product,"I've recently read a paper that used a covariant derivative product rule for cross products. It was something like $\nabla_v (A \times B) = (\nabla_v A) \times B + A \times (\nabla_v B)$.  Here, $A, B$ are vector fields on a regular surface $S$, and $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection. From my limited knowledge of covariant derivatives, this seems implausible.  For instance, I believed that the output of the covariant derivative always lies in the tangent plane, which seems to contradict the above rule.  For example, assume $A$ and $B$ are tangent vectors, then $\nabla_v A, B$ are tangent vectors, so $\nabla_v A \times B \notin T_p(S)$. I'd like to read up on this, but none of my standard books on differential geometry cover the cross product. I understand that the cross product is a (1, 2) tensor, so it should follow the product rule associated with tensors, but I'm not sure if that results in the product rule above.  Could any differential geometers please give me a reference?

  the regions formed with only two colors so that no two adjacent
  regions share the same color. First of all, I was not able to solve it. Then I did I search on Google, and I've find the following here . 4.Show that if n lines are drawn on the plane so that none of them are parallel, and so that no three
lines intersect at a point, then the plane is divided by those lines into $\dfrac{n^{2} + n + 2}{2}$ regions. The next exercise is: Show that if the same lines as in problem $4$ are drawn on a plane that it is possible to color the regions formed with only two colors so that no two adjacent regions share the same color. Proof: With zero lines, you can obviously do it; in fact, one color would be sufficient. If you can
successfully $2$-color the plane with $k$ lines, when you add the $(k + 1)$st line, swap the colors of all the regions on one side of the line . This will provide a $2$-coloring of the configuration with $k + 1$ lines. (In fact, for this problem, there is no real need to have the lines in general position: some can be parallel, and multiple lines can pass through a point, and the proof will continue to work.)

122699,"How to estimate the number of articles on Wikipedia using the ""random article"" function?","There is a Wikipedia-type website of a fixed size of $S$ number of articles. You start at any article on Wikipedia. You then start to press the ""random article"" button and count the number of times $N$ that it takes for you to randomly generate the original page again. The goal is to find the best estimate for $S$ given only the number $N$. Assume that the ""random article"" function generates any particular article with a uniform probability and that each click is a (EDIT: independent) random event. The page that you start on does not count as a click and is thus not counted in $N$. This problem reminds me of the solutions to the locomotive problem and the German tank problem . Since the button is clicked N times, the case with the highest number of articles has all N pages being different pages, yielding an estimate of (I think) $2N+1$. This would mean that the best estimate would be less than $2N+1$, because it is always possible for $N$ to contain an article, other than the one you were looking for, to be repeated multiple times. Another possible solution is based off of the method of mark and recapture to estimate the size of animal populations in the wild. This method gives the estimate as $S=N$. This would because out of $N$ samples taken during the ""recapture"", exactly $1/N$ of them are articles viewed during the ""mark"" phase (original article that is remembered).

Similarly I argue that $M$ is not free.

Suppose $a_n$ be the number of regions into which a convex polygonal region with $n+2$ sides is divided by its diagonals, assuming no three diagonals have a common point. Define $a_0 = 0$. Show that $$a_n = a_{n-1} + {n+1 \choose 3} + n \quad (n \geq 1)$$ So far, I have that for $n \geq 1$, we look at an $(n+2)$-gon. Pick an edge from one of the $n+2$ edges from the $(n+2)$-gon. Then adjoin a triangle to it, so we can have an $(n+3)$-gon. Given the triangle that we adjoin to the $(n+2)$-gon, let's look at the exposed vertex of that triangle. We can create $n$ diagonals, since we can't create a diagonal by joining the exposed vertex to an adjacent vertex. So now, we have that $n$ diagonals run through the edge created by the intersection of the $(n+2)$-gon and the triangle. This gives us $n+1$ regions in the triangle. But now, I can't seem to find a pattern to why the $(n+2)$-gon has ${n+1 \choose 3}$ extra regions that is as a result of those $n$ diagonals traversing through the $(n+2)$-gon.

122755,Sequence converges iff $\limsup = \liminf$,"I want to prove that a sequence of real numbers $\{s_n\}$ converges to $s$ if and only if $\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n = s$. Here are my definitions: For any sequence of real numbers $\{s_n\}$, let $E$ be the set of all subsequential limits of $\{s_n\}$, including possibly $+\infty$ and/or $-\infty$ if any subsequence of $\{s_n\}$ diverges to infinity.  Then $\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \sup E$, and $\liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n = \inf E$. I know the theorem that a sequence converges to a point if and only if every one of its subsequences converge to that same point, so one direction of this proof is easy: If $\{s_n\}$ converges to some point $s \in \mathbb{R}$,  then every subsequence of $\{s_n\}$ converges to $s$.  So the set $E$ of every subsequential limit of $\{s_n\}$ consists of the single point $s$, so
$$\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \sup \{s\} = s = \inf \{s\} = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n$$ But the other direction seems more tricky... If $\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n = \liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n = s$, then every convergent subsequence converges to the same point $s$.  Also, there can be no subsequences which diverge to infinity (otherwise $\limsup_{n \to \infty} s_n$ would be $+\infty$, or $\liminf_{n \to \infty} s_n$ would be $-\infty$). But can't there be subsequences which diverge otherwise?  And wouldn't that throw off the convergence of $\{s_n\}$?

122857,Does the existence of a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $\mathbb{R}$ imply that choice holds up to $\frak c$?,"The axiom of choice is, for ZF, equivalent to the statement that every vector space has a basis. The implication of AoC by the existence of a basis for any vector space is shown in this paper . The proof of that theorem can be summed up as following: One adjoins all members of the sets $X_i$ from which one needs choice as variables to an arbitrary field $k$ creating the field of rational functions $k(X)$ over that field. Then a subfield $K$ of that field is defined through a variation of homogeneity that considers the index of the $X_i$ from which variables are occurring and finally the span of the variables as a vector space $V$ over $K$ is considered. A basis for $V$ over $K$ is chosen, and the construction is such that for all $x \in X_i$, the same set of basis elements occurs with non-zero coefficient in their $K$-representation. This fact is then used together with a similarity of the coefficients occuring to pick a unique $x_i \in X_i$ and an element was chosen as desired. Now, this comment made me curious if there can be a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis of $\mathbb{R}$ when choice fails at size continuum or below. That separates into three potentially hard (or, perhaps more likely, easily negatively answered) questions: a) Can we conclude anything from the existence of one specific basis? The construction of the critical field in the proof relies on the structure of the set family we choose from, and so it seems that these fields will not be isomorphic for different families of sets. But that doesn't say there cannot be a different proof where they are. Or it might also be possible to choose that one guaranteed basis for a family such we can imply choice for all other set families of the same cardinality - but then, does such a family exist? Any direct proof of the existence of well-orderings I know use multiple instances of choice, but perhaps one carefully chosen one can be enough? b) Assuming a) is positively answered, can we make any conclusions about lower cardinalities? Or, under ZF more strongly, can we actually say something about all subsets even if they are not comparable - can they still exist if we have choice for all families of sets of cardinality $\frak c$? c) Even if a) is answered positively, could a $\mathbb{Q}$-basis for $\mathbb{R}$ be used as this basis? This would then obviously require a different proof. To make the question precise, consider three versions of ""hold up to $\frak c$"": Do we have choice for families of sets where both the index set and all sets are subsets of $\mathbb{R}$? And, not necessarily equivalently, do we have choice for families of sets where both the index set and all sets have defined cardinalities $\le\frak c$ or perhaps $<\frak c$?","['set-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'model-theory', 'axiom-of-choice']"

$$ f(\alpha , \alpha) = \frac{2}{\alpha} \left[ \lfloor 2 \alpha\rfloor

with $\{ x \} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$. For large $\alpha$ the function $f(\alpha, \alpha)$ thus approaches $4$.

This other question by RiaD asks for a proof that $\dim C_A\geq n$ for any $A$.  The answer by Johannes Kloos uses Jordan Normal Form, and so yields the same result over any algebraically closed field $F$ in place of $\mathbb{C}$. Now let's write $C_{F,A}$ in place of $C_A$ to keep track of the field.  Note that $C_{F,A}$ is the kernel of the linear map $B\mapsto AB-BA$.  The dimension of a kernel doesn't change in a field extension because row reduction proceeds in the same way regardless of field, so if $K$ is a field extension of $F$ then $\dim_F C_{F,A} = \dim_K C_{K,A}$.  Since any field $F$ is contained in an algebraically closed field $K$ we can combine these facts to get $\dim_F C_{F,A} = \dim_K C_{K,A}\geq n$, so the original result holds for all fields $F$, not just algebraically closed fields.

123186,Why do we need (the abstract concept of) random variables (in discrete probability models)?,"What we defined : Suppose we have a (discrete) probability model $\left(\Omega,P\right)$,
where $P$ is the probability function (at least, that was the way
it was introduced in a course I took; that means only that $\Omega$
is at most countable, that $P\left(\bigcup_{i}A_{i}\right)=\sum P\left(A_{i}\right)$,
for all (at most countable and disjoint) events $A_{i}$ and that of course $P\left(\Omega\right)=1$).
We defined a random variable (rd from now on) $X$ to be a mapping
$X:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and then discussed some aspects of
$P\left(X=k\right)$ for some $k\in\mathbb{R}$ . What bothers me : To me, this definition seems rather artificial:
Why define a mapping like that, if there is no apparent need for it
(at least in this probability model) ? Since if we have an event $A\subseteq\Omega$,
that depends on some parameter $k\in\mathbb{R}$, (for example the
sum of the faces of dice be $k$) then we could just as easily define
a collection of events $A_{k}$ - one for each parameter - and discuss
aspects of $P\left(A_{k}\right)$, instead of the above way by using $X$. Of course one could now argue,
that $A$ does not always need to depend on some parameter $k$, so
one in some cases really has to ""convert""  probabilities
to numbers via $X$, but of all examples that I have seen until now,
even in $\Omega$ isn't made up out of numbers, somewhere a parameter
$k$ does sneak in, so we could equivalently work with $P\left(A_{k}\right)$
instead of $P\left(X=k\right)$, since defining the subsets of $\Omega$
whose elements we want to count (to establish the probability of the
subset) always amounts to using some $k$ in the definition of those
subsets (this reasoning extends of course also to other cases like
when we consider $P\left(X\leq k\right)$, since this can also be
circumvented by considering an appropriate $P\left(\cup_{j\leq k}A_{j}\right)$). Thus, introducing rd's seems to me to be a superfluous definition

123192,The definition of independence is not intuitive,"In the book ""Introduction to Probability"" by J. Charles M. Grinstead and Laurie Snell independent events are introduced in the following way: ""It often happens that the knowledge that a certain event $E$ has occurred has no effect
on the probability that some other event $F$ has occurred, that is, that $P (F |E) =P (F )$"". This is then taken as the definition (notice that the setting in which this is done is that of discrete probabilities - if this makes any difference). But I can't come to terms with this definition, because of the following two reasons: a) If I have a die then the event of getting a face with one of the numbers $1,2$, if rolling once, seems intuitively to be independent of getting a face with one of the numbers $5,6$.
But since these two events are disjoint, but neither is the empty space, by the above definition, they should be dependent, which seems very counter-intuitive. b) If we chose to somehow ""interpret visually"" this definition, then that would mean that the sum of the probabilities of all elements in $F$ weighted with the weight $1$ is equal to the sum of all probabilities in $F\cap E$ weighted with $\frac{1}{P(E)}$, because $$\sum_{\omega\in F} \omega=P (F )=P (F |E) =\frac{P(F\cap E)}{P(E)}=\sum_{\omega\in F\cap E} \omega \cdot
\frac{1}{P(E)}.$$ Or - if I use the equivalent definition of independence, $P(E\cap F)=P(E) P(F)$ - then the same interpretation of this definition would say that the sum of all elements in $F$ multiplied the sum of all elements in $E$, both  weighted with the weight $1$,   is again equal to the sum of all probabilities in $F\cap E$ weighted with $\frac{1}{P(E)}$. But both these interpretations seem artificial - out of this I can't deduce, why this definition is calling $E,F$ ""independent"". Could you please solve this ""paradox"" for me ? If I were to give a definition of independent events, I would say that $E,F$ are independent (which, for me, would mean ""they don't have anything to do with each other""), if $E\cap F =\emptyset$.

The ideal space $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is defined to be subset of $2^R$ consisting of ideals, equipped with the induced topology. This is the ring-theoretic analogue of the Gromov--Grigorchuk space of marked groups, which can be used to give nice proofs of simple facts about algebraic geometry over groups (cf. this paper by Champetier and Guirardel).  My question is: Is the 'ideal space' of a ring a standard construction in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry?  If so, what's it called and where can I read more about it? My motivation is to strengthen the analogy between algebraic geometry over groups and classical algebraic geometry. To demonstrate that it's a useful concept, I'll give an application.  But first, here are a few basic facts. $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is compact (because it is a closed subset of $2^R$, which is itself compact by Tychonoff's Theorem), Hausdorff and totally disconnected. Each point $I\in \mathcal{I}(R)$ is contained in a canonical closed subset $U_I=\{J\in \mathcal{I}(R)\mid I\subseteq J \}$ (which is in fact isomorphic to $\mathcal{I}(R/I)$). If $R$ is Noetherian then each $U_I$ is equal to the set of ideals that contain a (finite) generating set for $I$, and hence is open. The subset of prime ideals in $\mathcal{I}(R)$ is closed: indeed, for each pair of non-units $x,y$, the subset $N(x,y)=\{x\notin I, y\notin I, xy\in I\}$ is open, and the union of these sets is the complement of the set of prime ideals. Now here's a sample application -  a proof of a well known lemma. Lemma: If $R$ is a Noetherian ring then there is a finite set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_1,\ldots,\mathfrak{p}_k\subseteq R$ with the property that every prime ideal contains one of the $\mathfrak{p}_i$. Proof: The set of $U_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for $\mathfrak{p}$ prime is an open cover of the set of prime ideals.  Since the set of prime ideals is compact, there is a finite subcover.

Since $I$ is closed and the element of $X'$ belongs to $I$, it follows from a previous theorem that I proved that $c∈I$. Here is where I get stuck, I want to use that the function $f$ is bounded on a neighborhood $V_{d_x}(x)$ somehow to show that $f$ is bounded on $I$. I'm not sure how to proceed. $f$ is bounded on $I$ means if there exist a d-neighborhood $V_d(c)$ of $c$ and a constant $M>0$ such that we have $|f(x)|\leq M$ for all $x$ in $A ∩  V_d(c)$. I would like to do try a proof by contradiction somehow.",['analysis']
123379,"Show that if $f^{-1}((\alpha, \infty))$ is open for any $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, then $f$ is lower-semicontinuous.","I've tried looking for this question on this site, but I can't seem to find it. But if anyone can direct me to it, that would be great. But I'll pose my question in the mean time. As the title states, if $f^{-1}(\alpha, \infty)$ is open, then show that $f$ is lower-semicontinuous. Starting with the basics. The definition according to my professor gave on lower-semicontinuous is the following: Given a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ on a topological space $X$ , $f$ is lower-semicontinuous if, for any $x \in X$ and for any $\epsilon > 0$ , there is a neighborhood $N$ of $x$ such that $f(x) - \epsilon < f(x')$ for all $x' \in N$ . I proved the conversed of this statement, but for this direction I seem to be stuck, been thinking for it for an hour or two. To my understanding a neighborhood of a point $x$ is a subset of $X$ such that it contains an open set which has $x$ . To me, it seems that I must consider if $x \in f^{-1}(\alpha, \infty)$ or $x \in f^{-1}(-\infty, \alpha)$ . I started with the consideration of $x \in f^{-1}(\alpha, \infty)$ . So by definition of pre-image, $f(x) \in (\alpha, \infty)$ . We have that $\alpha < f(x) < \infty$ .  So it seems to me that I want a neighborhood of $x$ such that it satisfies $f(x) - f(x') < \epsilon$ for all $x' \in$ nieghborhood of $x$ . Fix $x \in X$ . Then I went on the path of suppose that $x \in f^{-1}(\alpha, \infty)$ and using that using $f^{-1}(\alpha, b)$ where $b = f(x)$ . Since $f^{-1}(\alpha, \infty)$ can be written as the union (index starting at $k$ ) of $f^{-1}(\alpha, k)$ for $k > \alpha$ and $k \in \mathbb{R}$ , then $f^{-1}(\alpha, b)$ must be open. Then the problem is that I can't get a neighborhood of $x$ such that $f(x) - f(x') < \epsilon$ . I get a neighborhood of $x$ but it has elements such that $f(x) - f(x') \not<\epsilon$ . I'll currently will update the progress of my work. Hopefully I can progress somewhere. Thanks.","['general-topology', 'semicontinuous-functions', 'real-analysis']"

$$ In trying to understand outer automorphisms of $S_6$ at the most concrete level of arithmetic, it appears to me that the $15$ generators whose cycle structure is $2+1+1+1+1$ get mapped to the $15$ permutations whose structure is $2+2+2$ (which also generate the group).  And the $40$ permutations whose structure is $3+1+1+1$ similarly get interchanged with the $40$ whose structure is $3+3$; likewise the $120$ whose structure is $3+2+1$ with the $120$ whose structure is $6$. But apparently the set of $90$ whose structure is $4+2$ is invariant, as is the set of $90$ whose structure is $4+1+1$. Is this in accord with the experience of those who've actually thought about this? Does some web page somewhere walk through this?  I would think the routine arithmetic would have been figured out.","['discrete-mathematics', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics']"
123420,A question regarding a cluster set,"I've been having some difficulty trying to prove this exercise in $\textit{Complex Analysis}$ by Gamelin: Let $\{z_k\}$ be a sequence of distinct points in a domain $D$ that accumulates at the boundary $\partial D$ and let $E$ be a closed subset of the extended complex plane $\mathbb{C} \cup \{\infty\}$. Show that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ on $D$ such that $E$ is the set of cluster values of $f$ along the sequence $\{z_k\}$. Now there is a theorem that states that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ on the open unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ whose radial cluster set at any $\zeta \in \partial \mathbb{D}$ coincides with the entire complex plane. In the exercise couldn't I just let $D= \mathbb{D}$, and somehow work from there using this theorem? I'd appreciate some input here.",['complex-analysis']
