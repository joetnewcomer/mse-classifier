1425179,Augmented coalgebras,"Let $C, \Delta$ be a coalgebra. Assume that it is coaugmented with coaugmentation $u\: : \: k\to C$ and co unit $\epsilon\: : \ C\to k$. Since $\epsilon\circ u=id $ we get
$$
C=\text{Kern}(\epsilon )\oplus k
$$
Set $\bar{C}:=\text{Kern}(\epsilon )$. Then $\bar{C}$ equipped with the reduced coproduct $\bar{\Delta}(x):=\Delta(x)-1\otimes x-x\otimes 1$ is a (non-coaugmented) coalgebra. Then we have a functor between the category of augmented coalgebras into the category of coalgebras. Does this functor defines an equivalences of categories? I ask this because a similar thing is true in the contest of algebras and aumented algebras. The idea is starting from a generaleal coalgebra $C',\Delta'$ choose a symbol 1 and define $C:=C'\oplus 1 k$, then define 
$$
\Delta(x):=\Delta'(x)+1\otimes x+x\otimes 1
$$
Do you know some reference about that?

1425212,"""alternate definition"" of continuity","I was trying to find a definition of the continuity of a function that fits better the unrirgorous definition that ""it can be drawed with a pencil in a single stroke"" and I came up with this:
a function $f : I → R$ is ""continuous"" iff for any $a, b \in I$ and any $\alpha \in (f(a), f(b))$ there is an $x \in (a, b)$ so that $f(x) = \alpha$. 
Basically this means that between two points $a$ and $b$ $f$ must assume all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. This definition is obviously no equivalent to the normal definitions since functions such as $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\tan x$ would not be continuous. But on the other hand they cannot be drawn in a single stroke (kind of). I myself find it a lot more intuitive than the normal definitions. What I would want to know is: how much sense does this definition make? Is it correct for functions whose domain is connected (so not $\frac1x$, $\tan x$)? English is not my first language and I don't learn math in English, so I may have used some terms wrongly. Please ask if something doesn't make sense.","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'functions']"
1425240,Geometrical representation of square of pi?,"a) Let's say I have a circle with a diameter $1$. Then a perimeter is $π$ (pi) and ratio between a perimeter and a diameter is $π$. b) I want to use π as a diameter of another circle, which gives a perimeter of $π*π = π^2$ and a ratio $\frac{π^2}{π} = π$. My question is if there are ways to illustrate a progression from a) to b) by continuous geometrical construction. Or, how would you illustrate $π$ squared by geometry? Added background information I was thinking if this could be done because fractions can be presented by infinite geometric series, which is true for pi as well (Euler?): a) $$\pi =\sqrt{ 6\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2}}$$ b) $$\pi^2 = 6\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i^2}$$ respectively to pictures above. So why this geometric serial representation: where (perimeter / diagonal ratio = 4): c) perimeter (D,E,F,G) = 4 AND diagonal (B1,C1) = 1 d) perimeter (V,W,Z,A1) = c) perimeter squared = 4^2 = 16 AND diagonal (D1,E1) = 4 is fundamentally different from a) and b) which can be expressed as geometric series? Other background for question is my wondering what does it really mean in real world physics when you use pi squared on equations like centripetal acceleration formula: $$\frac{T2}{R3} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM_{central}}$$ but it is really a side matter in this case. Update 2: Akiva Weinberger pointed out these practical formulas for pi squared: The surface area of a torus (donut shape) is $4π^2Rr=(2πr)(2πR)$ The volume $2π^2Rr^2=(πr^2)(2πR)$ For Euler equation I found this interesting figure, which is not exactly a progression I was asking, but a progression altogether visual and guide giving: Source: http://mathart.livejournal.com/24013.html","['geometry', 'pi']"

Show that $(g \circ f)^{-1}$ is equal to $f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$ as maps $\mathcal{P}(Z) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)$. We know that a map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ can be viewed as a map from $\mathcal{P}(Y)$ to $\mathcal{P}(X)$ which can be further denoted by $f^{-1}$. It's quite straightforward that $(g \circ f)^{-1}$ is define as $\mathcal{P}(Z) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)$ $f^{-1}$ is defined as $Y\rightarrow X$ and $g^{-1}$ is defined as $Z\rightarrow Y$ Hence, $f^{-1}\circ g^{-1}$ is clearly $Z\rightarrow X$ which essentially is $\mathcal{P}(Z) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(X)$ But is there a more rigorous proof?

1425286,Prove that it is not possible to completely cover a 6 × 6 chessboard by tiles which have dimensions 1 × 4.,"I think I have some sort of understanding of how to solve this but I'm not sure. I would colour the board with 4 colours such that every 1x4 rectangle would cover one of each colour. Then cover the bottom 4 rows such that we are left with a 2x6 rectangle. Then fill the 4 leftmost columns so we are left with a 2x2 square which will have 2 tiles of the same colour hence it is impossible to cover the board with 1x4 tiles. Would that be a correct answer? Edit: 
My colouring scheme works like this:
The 4 colours will be represented as 0,1,2 and 3. Working along the top row of the board, we may as well label the first four squares 0, 1, 2 and 3, in that order. In order to satisfy the property that any 4 × 1 rectangle placed on the board occupies one square of each colour, the next square along must be labelled 0. And the next square along must be labelled 1, and the next square along must be labelled 2, and the next square along must be labelled 3, and so on. So we see that every square in the first row will be coloured according to the
repeating pattern 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .. Since this seems to work along the first row, we can use the same trick to fill the first column. Then cycle through the rows marking tiles in the same pattern.
(The first tile of the second row is 1 so the tile to the left of it is 2, the next one is 3 and so on for every row) Finally the board will be coloured in such a way that the square in
row i and column j is coloured i + j modulo 4.","['tiling', 'parity', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1425415,Switch flipping sequence with no repeats,"Okay, you have N switches.  They are all off.  You may flip one switch at a time.  You must visit each possible state of switches being flipped without repeating any state.  At the end, you must be able to return to the original all-off state with one more flip.  How many ways are there to do this?  (Bonus: Ignoring the final rule that you must be able to return to the original state in one flip, how many additional ways are there to visit all states?) Examples: For 2 switches, this is trivial: 00
10  01
  11 You can go around the circle in either direction, for a total of 2 possible paths.  There is no way to ignore the final rule with 2 switches. For 3 switches, there are more possibilities: 000          000          000          000          000          000

000 100 110 010 011 001 101 111 These 6 paths will visit every possible state, but end on 111 , so they cannot be done in a cycle, since it will take 3 flips to get back to 000 . It can be proven that there are no other paths which visit all states without repeats.  Since there are 8 possible states, it will take 7 flips to get to them all, which is an odd number, so there must be an odd number of 1's at the end of the sequence.  These 6 circles and 6 straight sequences have exhausted all possible paths that do not repeat. The question is: How many such cycles exist for N switches?  I found these by hand, but there must be some formula that would account for all possibilities in a less tedious manner.  (And does this sequence exist in the OEIS?  It probably should.)","['binary', 'combinatorics']"

Observing the resulting sequence, what is the chance of any point in the sequence (aside from the first and last where it is not defined) to be a local extremum? I.e. either a local maximum (the point is larger than both its neighbors) or a local minimum (the point is smaller than both its neighbors). At first glance, you would think that once you've drawn the 1st point,  the expectancy of the 2nd to be smaller\bigger than the 1st is 50% and then the 3rd is bigger\smaller in 50% hence 0.5*0.5 + 0.5*0.5 = 0.5 chance.

1425573,Lie Groups Exponential Map,"Hallo Math StackExchange users, I have a little question concerning the exponential map and how one can apply this to infinitesimal transformations. I am an engineer in 2nd year and I want to write my bachelor thesis in fluid mechanics. I am using the book Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations (Peter J. Olver). As recommended by the author I started to read from Chapter 2.2 and was able to follow. But now I am stuck at something. It's about the heat equation; I could follow the text until the derivation of the generators of symmetry. $$
v_1 = \partial_x, \quad
v_2 = \partial_t, \quad
v_3 = u\partial_u, \quad
v_4 = x\partial_x+2t\partial_t, \quad
v_5 = 2t\partial_x-xu\partial_u, \quad \ldots
$$ After this passage the one Parameter Groups $G_i$ which are generated by the $v_i$ are calculated by using $(x',t',u')=\exp(\epsilon v_i) (x,t,u)$. It is concluded that $G_1: (x+\epsilon,t,u)$, $G_2: (x,t+\epsilon,u)$, $G_3: (x,t,e^\epsilon u)$, $G_4: (e^\epsilon x, e^{2\epsilon}t,u)$, ... . Can someone explain how I can actually calculate these groups? I tried this interpretation: $\exp(\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon v_i)(x,t,u) =(x+\epsilon v_i \cdot x,t+\epsilon v_i \cdot t, u \epsilon v_i \cdot u)$. I could recover $G_1$ and $G_2$ using this approach, while interpreting the operation between the exponential and the $(x,t,u)$ as a simple dot product. But from there I have no clue how to show that for $G_3$ and the other $G_i$. I tried this for $v_3 = u\partial_u$. $\exp(\epsilon u\partial_u)(x,t,u)=(1+\epsilon u\partial_u+\frac{(\epsilon u\partial_u)^2}{2!}+...)(x,t,u)=(x,t,u+u\epsilon_u u)=(x,t,u+\epsilon u)$. I left out the higher order terms as I thought, that $\partial_u \partial_u u = 0$. If I had kept them in the series I could have recovered $G_3: (x,t,e^\epsilon u)$, but I could not explain it to myself why this should make any sense.
But the textbook says $G_3: (x,t,e^\epsilon u)$. Could someone explain me (step by step) how one can get these groups? The book is really doing a bad job at explaining these steps.

1425591,Group Ring to Hopf Algebra -- I'm missing something simple,"I've been working through Federico Ardila's online Hopf algebra lectures and hoped to check my understanding so far by constructing the Hopf algebra of a very small group ring from scratch. But I've failed, which has left me in a state of perplexity. I chose $G=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{k}=\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. So my group ring $\mathbb{k}G$ is the set of all formal $\mathbb{k}$-linear combinations of the two elements of $G$ (I'll call them $e$ and $a$ to avoid confusion with the coefficients, which I'll write as 0, 1, 2). On top of this structure we have: Multiplication as defined here . Comultiplication as $r\mapsto r\otimes r$, for each $r\in \mathbb{k}G$ The unit as $g\mapsto 1_\mathbb{k}$ for $g\in G$, extended linearly (so, for example, it maps $2e + a\mapsto 2 + 1 = 3 = 0 \mod 3$) The counit as $\lambda \mapsto \lambda e$ for all $\lambda\in \mathbb{k}$ The antipode as $g\mapsto g^{-1}$, extended linearly. But in this case, that's just the identity. With these definitions, I hoped this diagram would commute: but it blinking doesn't . Example: Along the top path: $(e + a)\to (e + a)\otimes (e + a)\to (e + a)\otimes (e + a)\to (2e + 2a)$ Through the middle: $(e + a)\to 2\to (2e)$. And it's obvious why: products in the group ring don't always annihilate the $a$ element, but the counit-unit sequence does. So this could never work.

for some $a,b,\varphi$ depending on $p,q,r,s$. The special case I posted in April was one in which $p=s$ and $r=q$ and there was nothing in it I thought was messy.  On this one I'm getting $\tan\varphi=r/s$ (that part's easy) and $a$ and $b$ are slightly messy rational functions of $p,q,r,s$. (Among the values of $\varphi$ whose tangent is $r/s$ I know of no reason to prefer any particular one.) Are this identity and the specifics of the function $$p,q,r,s\mapsto a,b,\varphi \tag 1$$ universally known and out there in the literature somewhere?

1426348,Learning Roadmap to Function Spaces,"We are a small group of people that would like to start a reading course with the topic 'Function Spaces'. 
So far, we have all attended some graduate courses in Functional Analysis, Measure Theory, PDEs and some Harmonic Analysis (about the first four chapters of Grafakos' first book). Especially, we enjoyed the part about Sobolev Spaces a lot and we would like to deepen our knowledge in that area. Furthermore, we would like to enter that huge zoo of function spaces that are important in the modern theory of PDEs (like Besov, Morrey-Capanato, Triebel-Lizorkin, Hardy, BMO, etc.), especially in the theory of regularity of solutions. However, we are a bit overwhelmed by the vastness of this field and don't know where to start and what to read. We intend to start with the paper Hitchhiker’s guide
to the fractional Sobolev spaces first since we have no background knowledge in fractional Sobolev spaces yet and it seems to be a good resource. But what is next? Sure, we thought about the classical books like Triebel's 'Theory of Function Spaces' but in this book, a lot of proofs are missing. 
Also, we found the book 'Morrey and Campanato Meet Besov, Lizorkin and Triebel' but it turned out to be very hard to read for a beginner. Could anybody give us some advice?

He says that he will only sketch the proof which might be the source of confusion. I will state the proof up to the point that causes the problems and explain what exactly causes the troubles. $\textbf{Proof: }$ So first we consider the $1$-form $pdq$ on the manifold $M_f:=\{(p_1,..,p_n,q_1,..,q_n)=:(p,q) \in M; F_1(p,q)=f_1,...,F_n(p,q)=f_n\}$ where $F_1,..,F_n$ have linearly independent derivatives and $M$ is a symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$. addendum: It can be shown that $\omega|_{M_f} = 0$ and he also assumed that $\frac{\partial I}{\partial f}|_{M_f}$ is invertible in a previous proof. Therefore, $S(x)= \int_{x_0}^{x} pdq|_{M_f}$ is invariant under deformations of paths $(x_0 \rightarrow x)$ (by Stokes' theorem). addendum: It can be shown that if $M_f$ is connected and compact it is diffeomorphic to a torus. Still, $S$ is multiple-valued as when we integrate around one circle $\gamma_i$ of this torus, we get a period $\Delta_i (S)= \int_{\gamma_i} dS = 2 \pi I_i.
$ Now he continues by saying: Let $x_0$ be a point on $M_f$, in a neighbourhood of which the $n$ variables $q$ are coordinates of $M_f$ such that the submanifold $M_f \subset \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is given by $n$-equations of the form $p= p(I,q)$, $q(x_0)=q.$ In a simply connected neighborhood of the point $q_0$ a single-valued function is defined $S(I,q) = \int_{q}^{q} p(I,q) dq.$ Finally, he remarks that: It is not difficult to verify that these formulas actually give a canonical transformation, not only in a neighborhood of the point under consideration but also ""in the large"" in a neighborhood of $M_f$. $\textbf{Question:}$ Now my question is: Why is it possible to take $(I,q)$ as coordinates, i.e. what is the argument that explains why the coordinates $q$ can be taken as even global coordinates (as Arnold actually says that it is easy to conclude that this also holds true in the ""large "" around $M_f$) in a nbh of $M_f$?

1426914,basic question on varieties (algebraic geometry),"I study basic algebraic geometry and I saw this exercise:
V is the complement of the twisted cubic in $$ A_c^3. $$ i.e. $$ V = A_c^3 - \{(t^3, t^4, t^5) \mid t\in c\}. $$
1. How can I proove that V is not an affine variety (and is a quasi-affine)? 2. How should I present V as a union of affine neighborhoods? Thanks!","['algebraic-geometry', 'affine-geometry']"
1426916,Minimal number of animals in a matching card game,"I saw a card game designed for small children. Each card has a picture of 6 animals on it, and there are 31 cards. When any two cards are compared to each other, they share exactly one animal. The game is for the child to find the animal that is common to both cards. I began to wonder how many animals the company would need to draw in order to produce such a set of cards. So here's the question. Given N cards with K animals on each card, what is the minimum number of unique animals required such that there can exist at least one collection of animals on cards where each card shares precisely one animal with each other card?","['combinatorial-designs', 'combinatorics']"

1427045,Showing every finite rank n vector bundle over the affine line is trivial of rank n,"In Ravi Vakil's algebraic geometry notes, exercise 13.2.C asks to show that every finite rank n vector bundle over $X = \mathbb{A}^1_k$ is actually free of rank n. The hint is to use the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over PIDs. My question is how to show that the vector bundle being locally free implies it is globally finitely generated. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be our vector bundle. If $\mathcal{F}(X)$ is finitely generated the structure theorem implies it's free, and clearly when we restrict down to one of our open sets over which is was free of rank n the ranks must agree. But why is it finitely generated? Is it simply because if it were not I could construct a submodule of $\mathcal{F}(X)$ of rank greater than n? i.e. by choosing linearly independent elements.",['algebraic-geometry']
1427079,Is holomorphic function on the Riemann sphere entire?,"What does holomorphic function on the Riemann sphere mean? Is that just $f\in H(\mathbb{C}\cup \{\infty\})$, so $f:\mathbb{C\cup \{\infty\}}\to \mathbb{C}$. And is $f$ entire? Since $f$ is holomorhpic over the whole complex plane. I am attempting to prove the following: All holomorphic functions on the Riemann shpere are constant The way to do this is by Liouville's theorem, which said every bounded entire function is constant. So I just need to show that entire function on Riemann sphere is bounded.",['complex-analysis']
