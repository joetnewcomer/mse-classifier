2872900,Using Variation of Parameters to Find the General Solution of $u''-u=\frac{2}{e^x+1}$,"I am trying to use variation of parameters to find the general solution to the inhomogeneous ODE
  $$u''-u=\frac{2}{e^x+1}$$ By computing the characteristic polynomial of the homogeneous equation $u''-u=0$, I have found $$u_H=c_1e^x+c_2e^{-x} \ \ \ \ c_1,c_2\in\mathbb{R}$$
Hence $u_1(x)=e^x, u_2(x)=e^{-x}$. So,
\begin{align}
v'_1(x)&=-\frac{u_2(x)f(x)}{W(x)} \\
v_1(x)&=\int \frac{e^{-x}}{e^x+1} \ dx \\
&=-e^{-x}+\ln|e^{-x}+1|+C_1

\begin{align}
v'_2(x)&=\frac{u_1(x)f(x)}{W(x)} \\
v_2(x)&=-\int \frac{e^{x}}{e^x+1} \ dx \\
&=-\ln|e^{x}+1|+C_2

$$u(x)=v_1(x)u_1(x)+v_2(x)u_2(x)=\left(-e^{-x}+\ln|e^{-x}+1|+C_1\right)e^x+\left(-\ln|e^{x}+1|+C_2\right)e^{-x}$$

($V_p$ denotes the tangent space at $p$) Theorem: Given a metric $ g$, there exists some orthonormal basis $v_1,...,v_n$ for $ T_p$ for each $ p \in M$, i.e. $ g(v_\mu,v_\nu)=\pm \delta_\mu^\nu$.

2872997,Solutions of the equation $(m! + 2)\sigma(n) = 2n \cdot m!$ where $5 \leq m$,"Are there any pairs of natural numbers $(m, n)$, with $5 \leq m$, other than $(5, 15128)$ and $(6, 366776)$, that satisfy the condition $(m! + 2)\sigma(n) = 2n \cdot m!$, where $\sigma(n)$ denotes the sum of divisors of $n$ and $m!$ denotes the factorial of $m$? This question arises from the theory of immaculate groups (or, equivalently, Leinster groups). An immaculate group is a group, such that its order is equal to the sum of all orders of its proper normal subgroups. It is easy to see, that if $A$ is a non-abelian simple group then $A\times\mathbb{Z}_n$ is immaculate iff $(|A|+1)\sigma(n) = 2|A|n$. Two well known examples of immaculate groups of that form are $A_5\times\mathbb{Z}_{15128}$ and $A_6\times\mathbb{Z}_{366776}$. In terms of immaculate groups this question thus can be reworded as:
""Does there exist any immaculate group of the type $A_n \times \mathbb{Z}_n$ other than those two?"". I checked this condition for all $n \leq 10000$ and $5 \leq m \leq  7$ but found nothing. Any help will be appreciated.

2873110,Algebraic topology for non-nice spaces,"I recently read something along the lines of ""General topology deals with the nice properties of pathological spaces, and algebraic topology with the pathological properties of nice spaces"". In a sense, this is consistent with my experience of both subjects, at least the part concerning which spaces we're talking about : in general topology often one thinks of the worst possible cases (e.g. totally disconnected spaces, non separated spaces, etc.), but in algebraic topology those are usually kept out : if someone says ""but the space has to be connected"", in algebraic topology we'll gladly add this as a hypothesis without a second thought; often we deal only with CW-complexes, or ""connected, locally path-connected, semi-locally simply connected spaces"" which are very far from the beasts one is concerned about in general topology. Of course this is very schematic and I'm just generalizing stuff (though if you think this is a bad generalization, please tell me so !), especially about general topology. However it's easy to come up with natural statements concerning nice spaces in general topology, we can easily add hypotheses such as path-connectedness etc. But can we go in the other direction ? Is there some ""algebraic topology of pathological spaces"" ? Of course it would have to look very different from what algebraic topology usually is (at least the one I know) : for instance the fundamental group of a totally disconnected space is quite useless. But I can't see a reason why, a priori, one couldn't associate interesting algebraic invariants to pathological spaces, perhaps they wouldn't be groups, but some other thing. For a more formal question (though still vague) : is there a reason why there aren't nice functors from $\mathbf{Top}$ to ""algebraic"" categories ?

I can split $x^4 - x$ in $\mathbb{C}[x]$ (which is not a field but which is contained in the field $\operatorname{Frac}(\mathbb{C[x]})$ ). The roots are $F = \{ 0, 1, \frac{-1 - i \sqrt{3}} {2}, \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}} {2} \}$ . So what does it mean to adjoin a suitable root to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ? I have been unable to construct a four element field using either complex root. So I went and tried to use the proof of Thm 33 (Galois) which gives a construction. In this case, F is as above and has the required four elements with $p = 2$ , $n = 2$ , and $q = 4$ , and indeed $F \setminus \{0\}$ behaves as desired for multiplication. The problem is addition. How is addition defined? Normal addition is not closed, nor do I see how to define it to make it work. Further, given Kronecker's and Galois's theorems, I would assume that addition must be defined as it would be in the containing field.","['galois-theory', 'finite-fields', 'abstract-algebra', 'extension-field']"

In general if we restrict valid inputs to be of length $L$, then a valid input is a tuple of the form $\{-1,0,1\}^L$. I've been self-learning some algebra on the side, and was realizing that these valid inputs start to look like a vector space. To illustrate in the case of $L=3$: we can sometimes add these inputs nicely element-wise: $(0,1,-1) + (1,0,1) = (1,1,0)$ we have an additive neutral element $(0,0,0)$ we can multiply inputs element-wise by scalars from $(-1,1,0)$ under element-wise addition each element has an ""inverse"" in the sense that another sequence exists that sends it to the neutral element (but elements are not invertible) But we have a problem here! This is because we can't specify an input bigger than $1$ in absolute value to the pulser. We can model the pulser input as saturating so that the input $(1,-1) + (1,-1) = (1,-1)$. This implies that we do not have have associativity, as $-1+(1+1) = -1 + 1 = 0$ but $(-1+1)+1 = 0+1 = 1$. Upon realizing this, I began to wonder if there was some other acceptable way of defining the group operation to both faithfully model the tri-state pulser but also get an actual group structure. Inputs are really a sort of ""direct sum"" of individual inputs, and so we can consider the problem at the individual input level. Unfortunately, there is only one unique group (up to isomorphism) with three elements, and this is the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. Unfortunately, it makes no physical sense to say that providing a very high input voltage level (ex. $6$) to the pulser should be the same thing as providing zero voltage to the pulser. So the cyclic group doesn't seem to provide a good model. So we have a structure that superficially looks like a vector space, where: ""addition"" is commutative, but not associative ""addition"" has an additive neutral, and ""inverses"" exist multiplication by a scalar is defined, has identity, and is distributive What algebraic object is this? (Parenthetical follow-up: Is group theory really the right tool to try and understand this structure?

2873385,A function satisfying $f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Is there a function whose inverse is exactly the reciprocal of the function, that is $f^{-1} = \frac{1}{f}$? (6 answers) Closed 5 years ago . Background . This question originates from the problem of finding a function $f$ such that its $n$-th iterate is equal to its $n$-th power, which I asked about here . Now I would like to focus on the related case $n = -1$, because it seems to be quite a different problem. In other words, I am looking for a function $f$ such that its compositional inverse is equal to its multiplicative inverse, that is,
$$f^{-1}(x) = \frac 1 {f(x)}.$$
It is immediate to see that this is equivalent to
$$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(x)} \right ) = x$$
which is the equation in the title. I believe I have found an example of a function $f \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+$ satisfying the equation, but it is quite convoluted. The construction is as follows: Let $x \in \mathbb Q^+$. Then we can write
$$x = \left ( \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}} \right )^n$$
where $p_1, \dotsc, p_h, q_1, \dotsc, q_k$ are distinct prime factors, $p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h} \le q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}$, the exponents $a_1, \dotsc, a_h, b_1, \dotsc, b_k$ are coprime positive integers, and $n \in \mathbb Z$. Then we define
$$\rho \colon \mathbb Q^+ \to \mathbb Q^+ \qquad \rho (x) = \frac {p_1^{a_1} \dotsb p_h^{a_h}} {q_1^{b_1} \dotsb q_k^{b_k}}.$$ Clearly the image $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$ is countably infinite, so we can fix two sequences $(r_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ and $(s_m)_{m \in \mathbb N}$ such that:
$$r_0, s_0, r_1, s_1, \dotsc, r_m, s_m, \dotsc$$
is an injective enumeration of $\rho(\mathbb Q^+)$. Notice then that each $x \in \mathbb Q^+$ is either $r_m^n$ or $s_m^n$ for some $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$, in a unique way. Therefore, we define
$$f(r_m^n) = s_m^n \qquad f(s_m^n) = r_m^{-n}$$
for all $m \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb Z$. With this definition, we can check that the above property is satisfied:
$$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(r_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {s_m^n} \right ) = f (s_m^{-n}) = r_m^n$$
$$f \left ( \frac 1 {f(s_m^n)} \right ) = f \left ( \frac 1 {r_m^{-n}} \right ) = f (r_m^n) = s_m^n.$$ My questions are: Are there any less artificial functions satisfying the equation? If so, is there such a function that is defined on an interval of $\mathbb R$? Remark . If $f$ is defined on an interval $I$ of $\mathbb R$ and is always positive (or negative), then it is monotonic. Indeed, if $f$ were increasing we would have
$$x_1 < x_2 \implies f(x_1) < f(x_2) \implies \frac 1 {f(x_1)} > \frac 1 {f(x_2)} \implies x_1 > x_2$$
and similarly if $f$ were decreasing.","['functional-equations', 'functions', 'inverse-function']"

By definition, each $p \in M$ the map $g_p : T_pM \times T_pM \to \Bbb{R}$ is a non-degenerate, symmetric, bilinear form. How to find a local orthonormal frame on a neighbourhood $U \subseteq M$ of a point $p \in M$ ? That is $n$-tuple of local vector fields $(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ defined on a neighbourhood of a point such that for any $p \in M$, $(X_1|_p,\dots,X_n|_p)$ is linearly independent, $\text{span }(X_1|_p,\dots,X_n|_p) = T_pM$ and $g_p(X_i|_p,X_j|_p) = \pm \delta_{ij}$. I've seen such construction for Riemannian manifold in Lee's smooth manifolds which using Gram-Schmidt procedure. Using similar idea as in Lee's, i came up with this following construction. The problem with using the same strategy (Gram-Schimdt) is that since $g_p$ is indefinite, the normalizing function $1/|\cdot| = 1/\sqrt{|g(\cdot,\cdot)|}$ is not automatically smooth function since $g(\cdot,\cdot)$ can vanish somewhere. However, i may get a way with this issue but not really sure. I need some opinion and justification for this. $\textbf{Choosing a local frame}$ Let $p \in M$ be arbitrary point and $\{v_1,\dots,v_n\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $T_pM$. Having this, we can find  a smooth local frame $(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ on some neighbourhood $U\subseteq M$ of $p$ such that $X_i|_p=v_i$ for all $i =1,\dots,n$ (See John Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds 2nd Ed, Proposition 8.11 ). $\textbf{Normalizing}$ We normalize them as follows: Since  $g(X_1,X_1): U \to \Bbb{R}$ is a smooth function with $g(X_1,X_1)(p) = g_p(X_1|_p,X_1|_p) =g_p(v_1,v_1)= \pm 1$, then by continuity we have a smaller neighbourhood $U_1 \subseteq U$ of $p$ such that $g(X_1,X_1)$ is strictly positive or strictly negative in this region, depends on the sign $g_p(v_1,v_1)=\pm 1$. Because of this $|X_1| = \sqrt{|g(X_1,X_1)|}$ is a non-vanishing smooth vector field on $U_1$, then we can normalize $X_1$, by setting 
$$
E_1 =  \frac{X_1}{|X_1|}.
$$
Similarly, the vector $V_2 = X_2 - \varepsilon_1 g(X_2,E_1)E_1$ is a smooth vector field with  $g(V_2,V_2)(p) = g_p(V_2|_p,V_2|_p) = g_p(v_2,v_2) = \pm 1$. So $g(V_2,V_2) $ has a neighbourhood $U_2 \subseteq U$ of $p$ such that it has only positive or negative values. So we have normalized smooth vector field
$$
E_2 = \frac{X_2 - \varepsilon_1 g(X_2,E_1)E_1}{|X_2 - \varepsilon_1 g(X_2,E_1)E_1|}, \quad \varepsilon_1=g(E_1,E_1)=\pm1
$$
defined on $U_1 \cap U_2$ and with $g(E_2,E_1) = 0$. Working inductively, we have $n$-tuple of smooth vector fields $(E_1,\dots,E_n)$ defined on $W = U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n$ given by 
$$
E_j = \frac{X_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \varepsilon_i \, g(X_j,E_i)E_i}{|X_j - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \varepsilon_i \, g(X_j,E_i)E_i|}  
$$
with  $\varepsilon_i=g(E_i,E_i)=\pm1$. By construction $g(E_i,E_j) = 0$ for $i \neq j$ and $g(E_i,E_i) = \pm 1$, and $\text{span}(X_1,\dots,X_n) = \text{span}(E_,\dots,E_n)$. Is this correct ? Is there any simpler approach ? Any help will be appreciated.

$$x=k \left(1+2 \cosh \left(\frac{1}{3} \cosh
   ^{-1}\left(1+\frac{2}{k^2}\right)\right)\right)\qquad \text{where}\qquad k=\tan(y)$$ which is valid for any $y$. What is interesting to notice is that $x(k)$ is almost a linear function  which is far away to be the case for $x(y)$ as one could expect. For large values of $k$, corresponding to $y \to \frac \pi 2$, Taylor expansion gives
$$x=3 k+\frac{4}{9 k}-\frac{32}{243 k^3}+O\left(\frac{1}{k^5}\right)$$ My problem is that I do not see how this could be used to generate an approximation for other values of $a$. Any idea will be more than welcome. Edit After @Mariusz Iwaniuk's comments, we could expand $y$ as a Taylor series for infinitely large values of $x$ and use series reversion. Using $\Delta=y_\infty-y$, we should end with $$x=\frac{a^2-1}{\Delta }-\frac{\left(a^2+1\right) }{3(a^2-1)}\Delta -\frac{\left(a^4+11

$$y_\infty=\frac \pi2 (a-1) \tag 2$$
$$y=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right)-\tan^{-1} (x)\tag 3$$
$$\Delta=y_\infty-y=a \left(\frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} \left(\frac x a\right) \right) -\left( \frac \pi2-\tan^{-1} (x)\right)=a \tan^{-1} \left(\frac a x \right)-\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\tag 4$$ seems to be an easier approach for large $x$. Expanding as Taylor series

2873722,"Alternative definition of ""sheaf""","Let $(X,\tau)$ denote a topological space and $\mathcal{O}$ denote a presheaf on this space with codomain $\mathbf{Set}$ . We can take the category of elements of $\mathcal{O}$ , which consists of a poset $\mathrm{el}(\mathcal{O}) = \{(U,f) : U \in \tau, f \in \mathcal{O}(U)\}$ together with a forgetful map $\pi : \mathrm{el}(\mathcal{O}) \rightarrow \tau$ satisfying certain properties. If $\cal O$ happens to be a sheaf, this should be reflected in the structure of $(\mathrm{el}(\mathcal{O}),\pi).$ There should consequently be a definition of sheaf like so: Let $(X,\tau)$ denote a topological space. Then a sheaf on $X$ consists of a poset $P$ togther with a monotone map $\pi : P \rightarrow \tau$ such that the following axioms are satisfied: (a) (b) (c) (whatever)... I'm a bit unsure what these conditions should be (even for a presheaf). We want to be able to restrict elements of $P$ to arbitrary opens, which makes me think we should view $P$ as a "" $\tau$ -module"", by which I mean that for all opens $U \in X$ and all $f \in P$ , we can form the restriction $U \cap f$ which would normally be denoted $f \restriction_U$ . The usual axioms of an action hold, e.g $$X \cap f = f, \qquad U \cap (V \cap f) = (U \cap V) \cap f.$$ I'm not quite sure whether this module structure should be viewed as extra data, or whether it can be recovered from the map $\pi$ . Note that we have $\pi(U \cap f) = U \cap \pi(f)$ , for example. Ideas, anyone? Addendum. I just learned that local homeomorphisms into a space $X$ are in bijective correspondence with sheaves on $X$ .

Pretty much I want to understand this paper pretty completely. My relevant background includes a formal undergraduate analysis course, a graduate measure theoretic probability course, and of course a bunch of random engineering mathematics/mathematical physics courses. I'm using the book ""Introduction to Differential Geometry for Engineers"" by Doolin/Martin to try and get up to speed quickly. The first ""definition"" given is the following: 
A subset $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a k-dimensional manifold if for each $\mathbf{x} \in M$ there are: open subsets $U$ and $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $x \in U$  and a diffeomorphism $f$ from $U$ to $V$ such that $f(U \cap M) = \{ \mathbf{y} \in V : y^{k+1}=y^{k+2}=...= y^n = 0 \}$. Thus, each point $y$ in the image of $f$ has a representation like $y = (y^1(x), y^2(x), ... y^k(x),0,...,0)$. The book also quotes an implicit function theorem, which I'll summarize as: 
If $F:\mathbb{R}^{n-k}\times\mathbb{R}^{k}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^k$ is continuously differentiable in an open set containing $(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$ and $F(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{0}$ then if the Jacobian of F is of rank $k$ then there is an open set $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$ containing $\mathbf{a}$ and an open set $B \in \mathbb{R}^k$ containing $\mathbf{b}$ such that for each $\mathbf{x}\in A$ there is a unique $g(\mathbf{x})\in B$ such that $F(\mathbf{x}, g(\mathbf{x}))=0$ Furthermore the function $g$ is differentiable. Furthermore, there is a change of coordinates such that assigns $g(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}$. My question is in regards to the following example from the text: Consider a $C^{\infty}$ function $F$ with the domain $A \in
 \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a range in $\mathbb{R}^k$, $k<n$. Consider the set
  $M = \{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n:F(\mathbf{x}) =\mathbf{0}\}$ Let the
  rank of the Jacobian of $F$ be equal to $k$ $\forall$ $\mathbf{x}\in M$.
  $M$ is an $n-k$ dimensional manifold. They indicate that this is true precisely because in the inverse function theorem there exists the change of coordinates that allows us to set $g(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ above. I don't see why that fact leads to the conclusion that $M$ is a manifold. Am I missing some obvious construction or something? I tried to construct an alternative argument: If I consider the function $f:\mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $f( \mathbf{x} ) = [x^{1},x^2,x^3,...,x^n, F(\mathbf{x})]$. I have $f\in C^{\infty}$ and defined on $A$, the domain of $F$, and I think its easy to see that for an open subset of $A$ we have the diffeomorphism as in the ""definition"" above"".

So let's take for example the function $$f(x,y)=\frac{x^3y}{x^2+y^2}$$ 
This function has a limit in $(x,y)=(0,0)$ and I'll have to prove it So according to my understanding, I'll have to examine the behavior of the function while it approaches $(0,0)$ from every possible path.
First I examined the trivial limits when $x=0$ and $y=0$ cases which both wielded the result $0$ as expected. Then I tried for  $t \in (0,1]$ the approach from every different line of origin $y=kx$ by setting $x=at$ and $y=bt$ (with a and b never both equal to $0$) to test the limit $$\lim_{t\to0} f(x(t),y(t))$$ which also gave $0$. 
At this point, I don't think that I've covered every single approach of $f$ to the point $(x,y)=(0,0)$, and even if I have, I think that in order to complete the proof I'll have to also mention the definition of limits, for which I am completely unfamiliar in multivariable functions, but I think that for this example it goes like this: Since for every $ε>0$ there is a $δ>0$ so that for every $(x,y)$ with $0 < ||(x,y)-(0,0)|| < δ$ then $|f(x,y)-0|<ε$ and the limit exists.

    f(x), & f(x)\leq n, \\
    n, & f(x)>n.
  \end{cases}$$
Here $f$ is a non-negative measurable function and $I=\lbrack 0,1\rbrack$.
I'm told to prove the following: Show that $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_I f_n(x)\,dx=\int_{I}f(x) \, dx$. Show that given $\varepsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $A\subseteq I$ with $m(A)<\delta$, then $\int_Af_ndx<\varepsilon$. Now if we assume $f$ is integrable, show that if $A\subseteq I$ with $m(A)<\delta$, then $\int_Afdx<\varepsilon$. I worked through this as follows and I would like to see if you can help me out with my mistakes and doubts. I readily noticed that $f_n(x)=\min\{f(x),n\}$, however I don't see how that can help me.
For part 1. I used the monotone convergence theorem. For this I (almost) proved that $(f_n)$ is an increasing sequence of functions. This is because $$
f_n(x)\leq f_{n+1}(x)\iff
\begin{cases}
f(x) = f(x) &\text{ when } f(x)\leq n,\\
n\leq f(x) &\text{ when } n< f(x)\leq n+1,\\
n<n+1 &\text{ when } f(x)>n+1.\\
\end{cases}
$$ The part of this argument I'm not so sure of is why does $n\leq f(x)$ when $ n< f(x)\leq n+1$? I tried drawing the function and the sequence on a piece of paper and it does make sense that $f_{n+1}\geq f_n$ in any of those sets. My justification is along the lines of ""if $f$ were less than $n$, it would occur that $f_n$ would also equal $f$ in that set and so $f=f$ gives no contradiction"".  I feel like my intuition is right but I can't formalize it. To complete the first part and apply the MCT I have to show that there exists a function $\phi\in L(I)$ such that $\phi\leq f_n$ for all $n$. The prime candidate for this function would be $\phi=f_1$. The question then reduces to the integrability of $f_1$ which I worked like this \begin{align*}
\int_{I}f_1d x &=\int_{\{f>1\}}f_1d x+\int_{\{f\leq 1\}}f_1dx=\int_{\{f>1\}}1d x+\int_{\{f\leq 1\}}fdx\\
&=m(\{f>1\})+\int_{\{0\leq f\leq 1\}}fdx\leq m(\{f>1\})+m(\{0\leq f\leq 1\})\\
&=m(\{f\geq 0\}).
\end{align*} Now since $f$ is measurable the latter set is measurable. But now I have another problem, how do I handle the case when the measure of the set is infinite? Is my process of showing that $f_1$ integrable even correct? EDIT1: Since $\{f\geq 0\}\subseteq I$ and both are measurable sets, it follows that 
$m(\{f\geq 0\})\leq m(I)=1$. By this it follows that $f_1$'s integral is finite thus $f_1\in L(I)$. Now we can apply the MCT to show the first part. Is this reasoning correct? If it were the case that all the answers were positive then by MCT we get the first part of the problem. For the second and third parts I'm stumped. I know that the condition in question is uniform integrability. I tried taking the integral of $f_n$ over $I$, but this time I separated it into $\{f>n\}$ and $\{f\leq n\}$ then it followed that \begin{align*}
\int_{I}f_nd x &=\int_{\{f>n\}}f_nd x+\int_{\{f\leq n\}}f_ndx=\int_{\{f>n\}}nd x+\int_{\{f\leq n\}}fdx\\
&=m(\{f>n\})+\int_{\{0\leq f\leq n\}}fdx\leq nm(\{f>n\})+nm(\{0\leq f\leq n\})\\
&=nm(\{f\geq 0\}).
\end{align*} How can I choose my $\delta$ with the quantity $nm(\{f\geq 0\})$? Once again I also have the question about my treatment of the past integral, is it done correctly? EDIT1: Following the same reasoning as the edit above, $nm(\{f\geq 0\})$ is bounded above by $n$. But this still doesn't lead me to a choice of an appropiate $\delta$... For the third part I can write $f$ as $f-f_n+f_n$ and since $f$ is integrable the difference of integrals has no problem. Then if $A$ is the set of the last item we have
\begin{align*}
\int_A|f| dx&\leq\int_A |f_n-f|dx+\int_A|f_n|dx\\
&<\eta m(A)+\varepsilon.
\end{align*} The last quantity is ""small"" so I feel like I can take $\eta=\varepsilon$ and then we will get a multiple of $\varepsilon$ so the whole integral is small. I feel like this needs to be formalized but I can't quite grasp it since I'm yet not sure about the second item. This is the whole of my process, any comments and suggestions will be very welcome.","['measure-theory', 'proof-verification', 'lebesgue-integral', 'proof-writing']"

2874467,"Is there a notion ""above"" that of perfect numbers?","When trying to understand a notion, it often gives great insight to see it as the ""shadow"" of something bigger, carrying more information. The notion of categorification relies on this idea. A basic example , where hopefully the point is clearly seen: if $n$ is a natural number and $\varphi$ denotes the Euler function, then the following identity holds: $$n=\sum_{d\mid n} \varphi(d)\tag{1}$$ Now if $\Phi_k(X)$ denotes the $k$-th cyclotomic polynomial, one can write $$X^n-1=\prod_{d\mid n}\Phi_d(X)\tag{2}$$
Then $(1)$ is a ""shadow"" of $(2)$, as it is obtained by taking the degree of the polynomials on both sides. Note that $(1)$ can be (and originally was) proved by much more elementary means that building the whole theory of cyclotomic polynomials, otherwise this observation would somewhat lose interest. Definition: a perfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all of its proper positive divisors. Question: Is there something ""above"" this definition? Attempt: A number-theorist's-perfect group is a finite group whose order is equal to the sum of the orders of all of its proper subgroups. For instance, cyclic groups with perfect order satisfy the above definition, since a cyclic group has one subgroup for each factor of its order. What is less easy, and the point of my question, is whether this notion is in any way actually interesting. Possibly more interesting if blanks can be filled: A nobody's-perfect group is a finite group satisfying [some conditions that could look interesting to a group-theorist and which imply that its order is equal to the sum of the orders of all of its proper subgroups]. In that last case one could start investigating the interest of that notion by trying to figure out whether there is a nobody's-perfect group of each perfect order.","['perfect-numbers', 'categorification', 'finite-groups', 'reference-request', 'group-theory']"

Do the hyperreals extend the Levi-Civita and/or Dehn fields? I've found unclear indications that the hyperreals extend the Levi-Civita numbers, but I wasn't able to find information on the comparison with the Dehn field.","['field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'nonstandard-analysis', 'ordered-fields']"
2874999,"Definitions of analytic, regular, holomorphic, differentiable, conformal: what implies what and do any imply that a function is a bijection?","I'm looking back at some complex analysis and have gotten myself a little muddled in all of the definitions analytic/ regular/ holomorphic/ differentiable/ conformal... In particular, at the moment I'm thinking about conformal functions $f(z)$ on open sets in $\mathbb{C}$. Many of the conformal maps I'm using are bijections on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$ e.g. Mobius Transformations. But other conformal maps are only bijections when restricted to a certain set e.g. $f(z)=z^2$ from $\{z:\vert \mathrm{arg}(z) \vert < \frac{\pi}{4} \}$ to $\{z: \vert \mathrm{arg}(z) \vert < \frac{\pi}{2} \}$ is conformal and a bijection but $f(z)=z^2$ from $\{z:\vert \mathrm{arg}(z) \vert < \frac{2\pi}{3} \}$ to $\mathbb{C}-\{0\}$ is not a bijection. Does bijection-ness feature of any of the definitions of analytic/ regular/ holomorphic/ differentiable/ conformal? Is it a result of any of the definitions? (e.g. might ""analytic"" imply ""bijection""?) Is there a specific name for conformal functions like $f(z)=z^2$ that can be restricted so that they become bijections?

2875041,"Implicit Function Theorem to solve $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ when $f\big(x,y,u(x,y),v(x,y)\big)$ mapped to $\mathbb{R^2}$","I am given $2$ equations $$f_1=x^2-y^2-u^3+v^2+4=0$$
$$f_2=2xy+y^2-2u^2+3v^4+8=0$$ and asked to show that we can solve the equations for $u$ and $v$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ in a neighbhourood of the solution $(2,-1,2,1)$.  I have applied the implicit function theorem and showed that $det\bigg(\frac{\partial f_1,f_2}{\partial_u,v}\bigg)$ at $(2,-1,2,1)$ is non-zero. My Question They then ask to solve for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$.  This is what I'm having trouble with.  I know that when we, for e.g, have $f(x,g(x))$ mapped to one function then we can solve for $\frac{dy}{x}$ by computing $\frac{dy}{x}=-\frac{f_x}{f_y}$.  I tried applying the same definition to this problem but had some difficulty.  I know that I can derive $f_1$ with respect to $x$ thus getting $\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x}=2x-3u^2\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +2v\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ and can do the same for $f_2$.  And from there I can eliminate $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$ and isolate for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$.  Is this the only procedure to solve for $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ or is there a formula like in the case for one component function.

$$\tan x+\tan 2x=1-\tan x\tan 2x$$
I rewrote it as $$\dfrac{\tan x+\tan 2x}{1-\tan x\cdot\tan 2x}=1$$
Using the identity, $$\tan (A+B)=\dfrac{\tan A+\tan B}{1-\tan A\cdot\tan B}$$ I simplified my equation as $$\tan (x+2x)=1$$ which implies $$3x=\dfrac{\pi}{4}+n\pi$$
So, $$x=\dfrac{\pi}{12}+n\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{3}$$
Where, $n$ is an integer. However, when $n=5$, $\tan (2x)$ is undefined. 
This is causing a problem.

2875099,Computing volume for a scutoid,"I was challenged by someone to compute the volume for a scutoid . At first I wanted to know how this shape is described mathematically, but did not find much on that so I started with what I already know: bottom is hexagonal top is pentagonal there is a triangle between 2 ""faces"" the 2 ""faces"" where the triangle cannot be in one plane Starting from these, the first thing that I needed to do, independent of the method of computation, was to get some formula for the non-plane faces. My attempt to solve this relied on assuming that the surface satisfies Laplace equation (I thought of it as an elastic membrane that is stretched so that it touches the edges of the face I'm interested in). Having those 2 computed, I guess one can try to integrate but I'm still traumatized by this approach, so I would make use of the method of inserting this shape into a cube like volume, generate random points and them count the ones that fall inside the shape. Any other ideas that are not based on using a PC (solving the Laplace equations and the volume computation part)?","['geometry', 'volume']"
2875142,Pigeonhole principle based algorithm,"I was trying to solve this problem. http://olympiads.hbcse.tifr.res.in/olympiads/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/inmosol-15.pdf INMO-2015 P6. From a set of $11$ square integers, show that one can choose $6$ numbers $a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2, e^2, f^2$ such that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \equiv d^2 + e^2 + f^2 \mod 12$. I came up with the following solution. We note that there are 4 distinct residues modulo $12$, namely $\{0,1,4,9\}$. LEMMA: Among any 5 squares we can find a pair that is congruent modulo 12. 
Since there are atmost 4 unique residues mod 12, by the Pigeonhole Principle we must have two squares with the same residue. We describe the following algorithm for finding $a,b,c,d,e,f$. Label the set of given 11 squares $\mathbf{Z}=\{Z_1,Z_2,Z_3\ldots\}$ and let $\mathbf{R}=\{\},\mathbf{L}=\{\}$. Consider the set of the last 5 elements. Among these elements, we may choose two elements with the same residue. Put one of these in $\mathbf{R}$ and the other in $\mathbf{L}$ Remove the elements from $\mathbf{Z}$. Repeat step 2 two more times. We can do this because each step removes two elements, and we need remove only 6 elements so at each step we still have 5 elements to work with. In fact by my count, we can do this one more time and end up with 4 integers in $\mathbf{R},\mathbf{L}$ each. My issues Is an algorithm a valid proof style? If it is, any tips on writing it better? Is the 4th integer possible? Thanks in advance!","['number-theory', 'combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory', 'algorithms']"

2875173,Numerical (Second) Derivative of Time Series Data,"First and second order derivatives are often used in chromatography to detect hidden peaks. The time series data consists of Instrumental Response vs. Time at very short time intervals (250 Hz). I wanted to calculate the second derivative of the data numerically in Excel. The simple option is that we calculate the first derivative and then calculate the first derivative of the first derivative to get the second derivative. 
The other option is to use the direct approach using central difference formula for the second derivative. The question is about the denominator of the second derivative from the central difference formula. It should the square of the time interval. This is my understanding and it is consistent dimensionally for example distance x (m) becomes acceleration (m/s2) as the second derivative of x. A reviewer wrote a rather denigrating comment saying that there is a lack of understanding of the second derivative ""definition"" where the authors assert that the definition of a second derivative requires division by the square of the time interval. This reference to the square of a time interval suggests a worrying lack of understanding of the nature of the derivative 𝒅𝟐/𝒅𝒕𝟐 as an operator and not as an algebraic variable. Do mathematicians agree with the above comment? Can we interpret d^2/dt^2 as if it is repeating the d operator twice divided by time interval squared?

2875179,"Why does Herstein add all these extra hypotheses for a ""simple"" modules proof?","An exercise paraphrased from Herstein's Topics in Algebra (2nd edition, Chapter 4, §4.5, problem 12): Let $M$ be an irreducible left $R$-module, where $R$ is an arbitrary ring and $rm \neq 0$ for some $r \in R$ and $m \in M$. Prove that if $T \colon M \to M$ is an $R$-homomorphism, then it is either the zero map or an isomorphism. This exercise is marked as more difficult than others, but I don't understand why, or why all of the hypotheses are necessary. In particular, I don't understand why the $rm \neq 0$ for some $r \in R$ and $m \in M$ matters. I know that assuming that implies that $M$ is cyclic, but not why that would be helpful here. Disagreeing with the text makes me think I've completely missed some subtlety of modules. Here's my attempted proof: Proof: The kernel of $T$ is a submodule of $M$. Since $M$ is irreducible, it can be either $\{0\}$ or $M$. If the kernel is $M$, then $T$ is the zero map, and we're done; if it's $\{0\}$, then $T$ is injective. Further, if the kernel is $\{0\}$ and $M$ has at least one nonzero element, then $T(M) \neq \{0\}$. Applying the irreducibility of $M$ to the submodule $T(M)$ yields $T(M) = M$, so $T$ is also surjective. $\blacksquare$ Have I gone wrong somewhere? If not, why would the extra hypotheses be added?
