1350719,Understanding Householder Transformations,"I've been thinking about Householder transformation for the past few days and one point appears to be escaping my insight. I hope that the following description helps someone correct my understanding and point me in the right direction. Based on a book I've been reading, in contrast to the popular convention, I'll assume that all vectors in the following discussion are row vectors . Let $\textbf{e}_0$ denote the leading row basis vector in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The goal is to transform a row vector, $\textbf{z}$ to the form $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ using an orthogonal, involutary matrix, $\Theta$. The vectors, $\textbf{z}$ and $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ are as shown in Figure 1 below. Suppose now that the difference $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ is aligned in the direction of some row vector, $\textbf{g}$. However, we do not know ""how much"" of $g$ is represented by $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||e_0$. Let's call it $2a\textbf{g}$. This vector is shown in yellow in Figure 2 below. Since $\textbf{z}$ and $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ are equal in length, they form the sides of an isosceles triangle. A perpendicular from origin to $2a\textbf{g}$ bisects it. Therefore, the vector $(\textbf{z}-a\textbf{g})$ is orthogonal to $\textbf{g}$. That is, $\begin{eqnarray}
&\phantom{\Rightarrow}&(\textbf{z}-a\textbf{g})\textbf{g}^T=0 \\
&\Rightarrow& \textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T-a\textbf{g}\textbf{g}^T=0 \\
&\Rightarrow& a =||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T.
\end{eqnarray}$ On the other hand, based on Figure 2, we see that performing the vector addition $(\textbf{z}-2a\textbf{g})$ will take us to $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ which is the reflection of $\textbf{z}$ w.r.t the perpendicular bisector from origin to $2a\textbf{g}$. In other words, $\begin{eqnarray}
&\phantom{\Rightarrow}& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}-2a\textbf{g}\\
&\Rightarrow& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g} \\
&\Rightarrow& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}\;(\,\textbf{I}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g}).
\end{eqnarray}$ From the last equation, we can read off $\Theta=(\,\textbf{I}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g})$ as the required orthogonal, involutary matrix that transforms $\textbf{z}$ to the form $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$. Now, an example. Suppose that $\textbf{z} = [1\;\;0.75\;\;0.25]$. Here, $||\textbf{z}||=1.2748$. Hence, the transformation we are looking for is $\textbf{z}_t=||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = [1.2748\;\;0\;\;0]$. Let us now write, $\textbf{g}=\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0=[-0.2748\;\;0.75\;\;0.25]$. Notice that according to Figure 2, $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ should in fact be $2a\textbf{g}$. But, if we do the computation, we'll see that $a=0.5$ regardless of what $\textbf{z}$ is. That is, $\textbf{g}=2a\textbf{g}$. In fact, if we substitute $\textbf{g}=\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ in $a =||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T$ above, we can show with a little bit of algebra that $a=0.5$. After finding $\Theta$ by evaluating $(\,\textbf{I}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g})$, we get some numbers and we will see that $\textbf{z}\,\Theta=[1.2748\;\;0\;\;0]$. The point that I'm missing is as follows: if we had called the difference, $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||e_0$ in the third paragraph above as simply $\textbf{g}$, we will not be able to find $a$ and hence $\Theta$. But, I know from Figure 2 that I might as well call $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||e_0$ as $\textbf{g}$ and observe that $a$ needs to be $0.5$ based on the properties of an isosceles triangle here. I'm missing some intuition here. Any comments? Thanks. Update : Can I instead make the following argument to explain how the Householder transformation matrix, $\Theta$ is derived by replacing a portion of the above discussion as follows: Suppose now that the difference $\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ is $\textbf{g}$, i.e. , $\textbf{g}:=\textbf{z}-||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$. This vector is shown in yellow in Figure 3 below. Since $\textbf{z}$ and $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ are equal in length, they form the sides of an isosceles triangle. A perpendicular from origin to $\textbf{g}$ bisects it. Therefore, the vector $(\textbf{z}-0.5\textbf{g})$ is orthogonal to $\textbf{g}$. That is, $\begin{eqnarray}
&\phantom{\Rightarrow}&(\textbf{z}-0.5\textbf{g})\textbf{g}^T=0 \\
&\Rightarrow& \textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T-0.5\textbf{g}\textbf{g}^T=0 \\
&\Rightarrow& 0.5 =||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T.
\end{eqnarray}$ On the other hand, based on Figure 3, we see that performing the vector addition $(\textbf{z}-\textbf{g})$ will take us to $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$ which is the reflection of $\textbf{z}$ w.r.t the perpendicular bisector from origin to $\textbf{g}$. In other words, $\begin{eqnarray}
&\phantom{\Rightarrow}& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}-\textbf{g}\\
&\Rightarrow& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}-2\times 0.5\textbf{g}\\
&\Rightarrow& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g} \;\;\;\;\;\textrm{    (where, we replaced 0.5 with } ||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{z}\textbf{g}^T \textrm{    from before)}\\
&\Rightarrow& ||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0 = \textbf{z}\;(\,\textbf{I}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g}).
\end{eqnarray}$ From the last equation, we can read off $\Theta=(\,\textbf{I}-2||\textbf{g}||^{-2}\textbf{g}^T\textbf{g})$ as the required orthogonal, involutary matrix that transforms $\textbf{z}$ to the form $||\textbf{z}||\textbf{e}_0$. As you can see, this explanation appears very roundabout. Is there an alternative way? Thanks for your comments.",['linear-algebra']
1350729,Properties that are true for finite sets but are (non-trivially) false for infinite sets,"The finite analogue of the axiom of choice is true, and it seems highly intuitive that it would be true for the infinite case. It is, however, undecidable. When explaining this to myself or to others, what I typically note is that our intuitions about finite sets don't necessarily hold over for infinite sets, and we should try to discard them. But this itself is an intuition that I'm looking to fortify. I thus ask, what are examples of theorems that hold true for finite sets, and to most people would seem to hold true for infinite sets, but don't. I.e., I'm looking for something that's provably false for infinite sets rather than merely undecidable.",['elementary-set-theory']
1350739,Operator Norm and Submultiplicativity against the Spectral Norm,"Consider $\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\to \mathbb{R}^{p\times q}$ to be a linear operator. I know that by considering the trace norm and using the submultiplicativity of the operator norm we have $\|\mathcal{A}(X)\|_F \leq \|\mathcal{A}\|_{op} \|X\|_F$ where $\|.\|_{op}$ denotes the operator norm and $\|.\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm. The question is whether we can also claim that $\|\mathcal{A}(X)\| \leq \|\mathcal{A}\|_{op} \|X\|  $ where $\|.\|$ is the matrix spectral norm (the largest singular value of $X$)? It is certainly true that $\|\mathcal{A}(X)\| \leq \sqrt{r}\|\mathcal{A}\|_{op} \|X\|
$ where $r = rank(X)$, but I am not sure about the one without $\sqrt{r}$. I would appreciate any thoughts or even references.","['analysis', 'spectral-theory', 'linear-algebra', 'normed-spaces']"
1350748,What *is* affine space?,"In my recent reading of various books and notes on algebraic geometry and scheme theory, I have come across three definitions of affine $n$-space over a field $k$ : $\mathbb{A}_k^n$ is $k^n$ 'without an origin'; $\mathbb{A}_k^n$ is simply $k^n$ with the Zariski topology (i.e. zero loci of sets of polynomials are closed); $\mathbb{A}_k^n=\operatorname{Spec}k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$. I know that things like the Nullstellensatz give us a nice way of going from one point of view to another when it comes to polynomial rings and affine varieties, but here I'm having some confusion.
For $k=\mathbb{C}$ (which is algebraically closed, so things should all act reasonably nicely) we have that the points of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{C}[x]$ are in bijective correspondence with points of $\mathbb{C}$, apart from the general point $[(0)]$.
So it seems to me that these definitions can't all be the same, but searching for affine space on Google or in books leads to any one of the above definitions, depending on the level of the text. Am I just making a silly mistake, or is there a difference in these definitions?
If so, which one is the 'right' one?","['algebraic-geometry', 'affine-geometry', 'schemes']"

1350756,Latin square property sufficient?,"So I know that for any group table, every row must contain distinct group elements and the same holds for every column for a group table. And this property is called the Latin square property. However, every time I read a book about abstract algebra, they say that the Latin square property is necessary but not sufficient for a table to form a group. However, I have not seen any counter example for that. So I was wondering if there exists a counter example for a table that has the Latin square property but is not a group? And what property will it violate from the 4 group axioms? I mean I know for sure that closure is not violated. When I was thinking of examples, the easiest I could think of is to construct a table which has no identity element as follows $$
\begin{array}{c|lcr}
 & e & a & b \\
\hline
e & e & b & a \\
a & a & e & b \\
b & b & a & e

1350765,Expectation of Nonnegative Random Variable - Measurability,"Recall the result that for a nonnegative random variable $X$ on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$,
$$
E[X] = \int_0^\infty (1 - F(x)) dx,
$$
where $F$ is the cdf of $X$.  In many of the proofs I've seen for this we rely on Tonelli's theorem in the step
$$ 
\int_\Omega \int_0^\infty \mathbf{I}_{[0, X(\omega))}(x) \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}P(\omega) = \int_0^\infty \int_\Omega \mathbf{I}_{[0, X(\omega))}(x) \mathrm{d}P(\omega)  \mathrm{d}x.
$$
Tonelli's theorem, however, requires that $\mathbf{I}_{[0, X(\omega))}(x)$ be $\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{B}$-measurable where $\mathcal{B}$ is the Borel sigma-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$.  I've spent quite a while trying to show this is the case here, but have come to believe I'm not equipped to handle showing measurability on product sigma algebras.  Would anyone be able to demonstrate a method to show this? As an aside, it seems that measurability is often implicitly assumed in applications of Tonelli and Fubini, and rather, the nonnegativity or integrability (which also implicitly assumes measurability) is focused on.  Is it just that measurability is ""so easy"" to get that it's okay to sort of neglect?","['probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

However, this does not agree with numerical evidence and also looking at the linearization method, which shows that the origin is indeed a stable node. Might someone have a suggestion for a Lyapunov function, as well as the domain to choose for it?

EDIT: Here is a streamplot of the system in a neighborhood of the origin,it appears that the origin is unstable, so I guess I was wrong with my initial assumption. I guess this agrees with my choosing of a Lyapunov function because the function is positive for all x and y(except at the origin), implying instability.

1351031,Existence of a Cech cover for computing Picard group,"Let $X$ be a variety -- one can compute $\text{Pic}(X) = H^1(X, \mathcal{O}^*_X)$ by choosing a Cech cover which is acyclic with respect to $H^\bullet(-, \mathcal{O}^*)$.

For example, take the quadric cone $X = \text{Spec} k[x,y,z]/xy-z^2$.  $\text{Pic}(X)$ is generated by the two rulings, and it seems like there isn't a distinguished open containing zero which cuts out a ruling.

In previous exercises it has been shown that $\phi$ universally closed is equivalent to $\phi$ being closed with compact fibers. Also it has been shown that $\phi$ universally closed implies that $\phi$ is proper, i.e. preimages of compact sets are compact. Also could be useful: a map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is universally closed, and a proper map into a Hausdorff $k$-space is universally closed. My strategy has been to show that $f$ is closed with compact fibers. I have succeeded in showing that $f$ must have compact fibers, but I have not been able to show $f$ is closed. The argument for compact fibers is: Suppose $y \in Y$. Then $(gf)^{-1}g(\{y\})$ is compact, since it is the preimage under $gf$ of the compact set $\{g(y)\}$. The point set $\{y\}$ is closed since $Y$ is Hausdorff, so $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is a closed set, because $f$ is continuous. Since $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is a closed subset of the compact set $(gf)^{-1}g\{y\}$, it is itself compact. QED Note that the same argument works for $\{y\}$ replaced by any compact set, so $f$ is surely proper. As mentioned, a proper map into a Hausdorff $k$-space is universally closed, so if we can show that $Y$ is a $k$-space, we'd be done, but I don't see why it should be.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

1351287,"If a set $S$ has a choice function, does $\bigcup S$ have one too?","I have an exercise in a book that asserts that if a set $S$ has a choice function on it, then so does the union of all its elements $\bigcup S$ (without assuming the axiom of choice). I, however, have serious doubts that this statement holds and I even have an argument against it. However, since I am up against the word of a textbook, I cannot be sure. I may just be missing something obvious. Hence, I want to verify my hunch. First a little clarification of my terminology: By a choice function $C$ on a set $S$ , I mean a function $C : \wp(S)\setminus\{\emptyset\} \to S$ such that $C(\sigma) \in \sigma$ . For a set $S$ , $\bigcup S = \{x \in \mathcal{U} : \exists y \in S\text{ s.t. } x \in y\}$ ( $\mathcal{U}$ is the universal class) i.e. it is union of all the elements of $S$ . Now, my argument against the book's assertion is this: if the axiom of choice (AOC) were false, then there would be a set $\Sigma$ which has no choice functions on it. Consider, now, the singleton set $\{\Sigma\}$ ; it clearly has a choice function on it but its union doesn't as $\bigcup \{\Sigma\} = \Sigma$ . Hence, if AOC were false, then I can prove this statement false using the other axioms of set theory. Thus, contrapositively, if I could prove this exercise true using just the other axioms of set theory, I could prove AOC too which seems ridiculous! Is my reasoning correct?

Sum Parameters: -If 1 is reached at an exact given point, the sum stops and thus making the sum finite. -The sum must be $\le $ 1 -All terms must be the reciprocal of composite numbers. -To find the next term in the list, you must find the largest reciprocal (that fits standards) that makes the sum $\le$ 1, and NOT the term that best fits the sum. For example, if you were to need to add $\frac{1}{x}$ and $\frac{1}{y}$ to make the sum exactly 1, but $\frac{1}{a}$ was the largest and still fit the rest of the parameters, then you would have to stick with with $\frac{1}{a}$.

The interior of $E \subseteq X$ is the set of interior points of $E$ and is denoted here by $E^\circ$. Two subsets of $X$, $A$ and $B$, are separated if $A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset$ and $\overline{A} \cap B = \emptyset$. A set $E \subseteq X$ is connected if it is not the union of two separated nonempty sets, i.e. if $\lnot \exists A \exists B (E=A \cup B \land A \neq \emptyset \land B \neq \emptyset \land A \cap \overline{B} = \emptyset \land \overline{A} \cap B = \emptyset)$ This last definition is logically equivalent to $\forall A \forall B ([E=A \cup B \land A \neq \emptyset \land B \neq \emptyset] \to [A \cap \overline{B} \neq \emptyset \lor \overline{A} \cap B \neq \emptyset]) $ So if $E$ is some neighborhood in $X$ then consider any $A$ and $B$ where $E = A \cup B$, $A \neq \emptyset$, and $B \neq \emptyset$. We must then show that $A \cap \overline{B} \neq \emptyset \lor \overline{A} \cap B \neq \emptyset$. First if $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ then clearly they are not separated so we need only worry about the case where $A \cap B = \emptyset$, i.e. they are disjoint. I think I can show this if both $A$ and $B$ are not open because if $A$ is not open then $\breve{A} = A - A^\circ \neq \emptyset$ and I can show that any $x \in \breve{A}$ is a limit point of $B$ thus $A \cup \overline{B} \neq \emptyset$, using the facts that $E=A \cup B$ and $E$, being a neighborhood, is open. However I am having trouble showing that both $A$ and $B$ cannot both be open despite thinking about it for days. It was shown in a previous exercise that two disjoint open sets are separated but obviously we can't use this since we are trying to show that the arbitrary $A$ and $B$ are not separated. I am thinking that a proof by contradiction is the way to go here and to show that if they are both open then $\exists x \in E (x \not\in A \cup B)$ so that $E \neq A \cup B$ but I cannot pin down how to show this. Anybody have any insights that might help me out here? NOTE: It has been brought to my attention below that not every $N_r(x)$ in every metric space is connected, e.g. $X=\mathbb{Z}$ for $r > 1$. So really I am talking specifically about $\mathbb{R}^2$, though I suspect it is true in any $\mathbb{R}^n$. Of course this implies that we'd probably need to use the fact that we are in $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the proof.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1351653,Algorithm to find shortest path to net values across nodes,"I have an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with nodes $V$ and edges $E$.
Each node $v$ has an associated number $n_v \in \mathbf{Z}$ Let us define for any two nodes $v, w \in V$ connected by an edge $e \in E$, that to net node $v$ with node $w$ means that we set $n_v = 0$ and set $n_w = n_w + n_v$. We also define that the cost of such a netting operation is $|n_v|f(e) \geq 0$ where $f : E \rightarrow[0,\infty)$ is a function describing unit cost of netting between $v, w$. As an example: In the above image, the big numbers in each node $v$ represent $n_v$ and the little numbers along each vertex $e$ represent $f(e)$. The Question By only netting nodes, I wish to make node $Z$ (green) the only non-zero node. I also want this done at minimal cost. Does anyone know of an algorithm that does this at minimal cost? In the above example, we should net node $A$ with $C$ (with a cost of $|-2|\times1$) and $B$ with $C$ (with a cost of $|-3|\times1$). All nodes apart from $Z$ are then $0$ with a total cost of $5$. Motivation Using an application for motivation, imagine we are a charity distributing medicine across cities in a country with a viral outbreak. The situation is rapidly evolving as the virus spreads or as people get better, and so some cities may find they have a shortage of medicine while others have surplus medicine. The situation may look like: We need to move medicine from where there is a surplus to where there is a shortage. The medicine can be transported from one city to another via interconnecting roads. There is a transportation cost involved in transporting each unit of medicine. Equivalently, we can move people from one city's hospital to another (we assume the same cost of transportation as medicine for simplicity, i.e. the undirected graph case). We wish to ensure that all cities have neither a surplus nor a shortage of medicine. Any surplus must be moved back to the depot. Any shortage must also be moved back to the depot (this represents the scenario when we need to create and distribute new medicine from the medicine depot).","['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-optimization']"

Especially, can one of them be a.s. continuous while the other isn't? Here is where my question originated from. You don't need to read it, but you would help me if you did and maybe spotted my mental mistakes I did: Prestory: Earlier I had some problems with understanding why two brownian motions have to have the same supremum, because as I understood it, all I knew about two different brownian motions would be, that they share some properties (e.g. the finite dimensional distributions), but for example don't need to share their overall distribution on $\mathbb{R}^{[0,\infty)}$. Now after doing some research I found out, that from the Kolmogorov theorem it follows that the finite dimensional distributions already uniquly define the distribution of a process on $\mathbb{R}^{[0,\infty)}$ and thus obviously its supremum. Problem: Now I read further in the script I got that from. It is a method for constructing a brownian motion. At that point we have a consistent family of measures $\mathbb{P}_J$ on $\mathbb{R}^J$, $J \subset [0, \infty)$ finite which are distributed like the finite dimensional distributions of a brownian motion. From that we can construct a uniquely defined measure $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{[0, \infty)}$ which has the finite dimensional distributions $\mathbb{P}_J$ of a brownian motion and from that construct a stoch. process with the coordinate projections $\pi_i, i \in [0, \infty)$. The last problem is, that this stoch. process isn't necessarily almost surely continuous. We solve that by showing that there exists a a.s. continuous modification. Now to my core problem. This modification obviously again shares the same finite dimensional distributions with the original process $\pi$. Thus it also has the same distribution on $\mathbb{R}^{[0, \infty)}$. So the two processes have the exactly same distribution on $\mathbb{R}^{[0, \infty)}$ while one being a.s. continuous and one not? This bugs me.

Consider a smooth function $f:\R^n\to\R$ and let $Df:\R^n\to \R^{n*}$ be the map which takes a point $\mathbf a\in R^n$ to the linear map $Df_{\mathbf a}:\R^n\to \R$. This itself is a smooth map whose derivative at a point can be thought of as a multilinear map from $\R^n\times \R^n\to \R$, the matrix representation of which (with respect to, say, the standard basis) will have second partial derivatives. On the other hand, the map $Df$ can be thought of as a $1$-form on $\R^n$, for at each point $\mathbf a\in \R^n$, we have a functional $Df_{\mathbf a}$. Explicitly, this $1$-form can be written as $$\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}dx^i$$ The exterior derivative of this is $0$. So there is a big difference between the notion of the (usual?) derivative and that of the exterior derivative. If I were asked to say something about what the usual derivative is trying to capture, I would say that the derivative is the natural generalization of the derivative of a map from $\R$ to $\R$.
A smooth function $f:\R^n\to \R^m$ at any given point in the domain behaves as closely as we please to a linear map, the derivative, in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the given point.

Trivially, if $\deg f$ is known then so is $f$, for instance by finding the values of $f$ at $\{0,\dots,\deg f-1\}$ and taking successive differences. But what if $\deg f$ is unknown? The most obvious thing to do to try and compute successive differences at $\{0\},\{0,1\},\{0,1,2\},\dots$ and wait for a pattern to occur, but my preliminary intuition tells me that this does not necessarily work.

1351949,$f$ is continuous on $E$ if and only if its graph is compact.,"This question may be asked before under different formulation, the original problem is Chapter 4, Exercise 7 of Rudin's text: The Principles of Mathematical Analysis : Problem: If $f$ is defined on $E$, the graph is the set of points $(x, f(x))$, for $x \in E$. Suppose $E$ is compact, and prove that $f$ is continuous on $E$ if and only if its graph is compact. My Attempt: Let $\Gamma(f) = \{(x, f(x)): x \in E\} \subset E \times \mathbb{R}^1$. I was trying to define a function $F: E \rightarrow E \times \mathbb{R}^1$ by $F(x) = (x, f(x))$ and show $F$ is continuous on $E$. Since $E$ is compact, it follows that $F(E) = \Gamma(f)$ is compact. For the converse, the earlier thread A real function on a compact set is continuous if and only if its graph is compact stated that the projection function $\pi$ is continuous on $E \times \mathbb{R}^1$. My question is: without knowing any specific metric on $E$ or on $E \times \mathbb{R}^1$, it looks hard to me to show that $F$ and $\pi$ aforementioned are continuous.

1351957,Find a point so that the triangle is equilateral,"We have O(0,0), A(3,4) and B(x,y). Find $x,y\in{R}$ so that the OAB triangle is equilateral. I tried using the fact that the median is also the altitude(height) of the equilateral triangle. I calculated that distance from O to A(it's 5), meaning all the sides of the triangle have to be 5. Then, I computed the line equation for OA. I set M as the middle point of line OA. I then computed the equation for the line BB' which would be perpendicular on line OA(I knew the slope, since I knew the slope of line OA and I knew that M was a point on the line) and pass through point M(the median/height of the triangle). After all this I could say that: $$d(O,B)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=5$$
and $$d(A,B)=\sqrt{(3-x)^2+(4-y)^2}=5$$ The solutions I get from this equation system should be in the form of x,y, where x and y are the coordinates of point B. The system should return me more than one solution, but in order for it to be right I must also check that the points I get are also on line BB'. Anyway, that was my thought process. The problem is that I'm getting into really 'icky' equations that I deem hard to solve, giving me really odd solutions for my coordinates. Isn't there a better way to solve this problem?

1351967,Finding Gaussian Primes along Lines in $\mathbb Z[i]$,"I am trying to prove the following statement: For all positive integers $a$ does there exists a positive integer $b$ such that $a^2 + b^2$ is prime? (If so, can we provide such a $b$?) Given the connection between primes of this form and Gaussian primes, the above problem leads to the lemma: Given a positive integer $a$ does there exist a positive integer $b$ such that $a+bi$ is a Gaussian prime. (If so, can we provide such a $b$?) Based on the pictures generated of Gaussian primes, such as the ones shown in A Stroll Through Gaussian Primes , it seems to the case that this statement is true. (The pictures suggest that every vertical line in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ contains at least one Gaussian prime.) My current approach, which is somewhat of a longshot, goes as follows: a Gaussian integer $z = a+bi$ is a Gaussian prime if and only if $N(z) := a^2 + b^2$ is prime. Given some $a$, consider the Gaussian integers $$z_n = a + ni, \quad n=0, \ldots, a,$$ and the corresponding norms $$N_n := N(z_n) := a^2 + n^2, \quad n=0, \ldots, a.$$ These norms range between $N_0 = a^2$ and $N_a = 2a^2$. By Bertrand's Postulate, there exists some prime $p$ within that range of norms. The part that I was hoping could be proven is that there exists some prime $p$ such that $p = N(z_n)$ for some $n$ . Finally, here is a little Python code demonstrating that this is true for $a = 1, \ldots, 100000$: %pylab

1351969,Distribution of the sum reciprocal of primes $\le 1$,"$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{43}+\cdots \le 1 $$ This is an interesting infinite summation. This is very closely resembling my other problem with has to do with the distribution of composites. That other problem is here . The same rules of that other summation apply, but it's good to repeat them :). Rules of this summation: 1) All terms of the summation must be reciprocal of some prime. For example, $\frac{1}{6}$ could never be a term because 6 is not a prime number. 2) The next term must be the largest reciprocal term that does not allow the entire sum to be $>1$. The next term also must be < the term before it. 3) The sum must also be permanently less than $1$ if you were to stop at a number $\lt \infty$. If you were to stop on term $\infty$, then the sum would amount to exactly $1$ by definition. Now that you know the rules, we must rewrite the summation in a different way in order to propose my question in a reasonable manner. $$\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}+\frac{1}{d}+\cdots\le 1$$ As a mote of clarification, $a, b, c, d$, etc. represent $2, 3, 7, 43$, etc. respectively.

My question is what function, $f(n)$, could hold this property and maintain true no matter what term you are at. -One who is loving this must remember that $a, b, c, d$, etc. are integers rather than fractions in this case and therefor $f(1) \not= 1/a, f(1) \not= 1/b$, etc.
The reciprocal however is the form in which the numbers have that interesting property. -What is $f(n)$?
