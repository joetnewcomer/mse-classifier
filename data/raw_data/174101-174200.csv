3106372,How to find the second solution to an ODE of the form $xy''+y'-xy=0$?,"I am learning about the Frobenius method to solving ordinary differential equations, but I seem to have some difficulty with finding the second linearly independent solution to the above equation (this is a homework problem). I was hoping someone could point out what is going wrong here. To start, I found my first solution by letting $y = x^{r} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$ . Using this method and substituting it above, I found the first solution to be: $$ y_1 = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{2n}}{2^{2n}(n!)^2}.$$ The characteristic of the original ODE is $r^2 = 0$ , so we have repeated roots. Therefore, the second solution should contain a logarithm and be given by: $$y_2 = y_1 \ln x + x^{r+1} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n x^n.$$ When I do this, I find that the coefficients $b_{2n} = 0$ , and the recursion relation for the odd coefficients is (with $b_1 = -1/4$ ): $$ b_{2n-1} = \frac{b_{2n-3}}{(2n)^2} - \frac{2}{2^{2n} (n!)^2 (2n) }, \,\, n \ge 2.$$ The issue is that this recursion relation will yield coefficients that are always negative. However, the actual solution yields alternating coefficients, which means something above is wrong. I'm only interested in the first few terms of the solution for $y_2$ , but I still need to get the alternative terms. I know the actual second solution is given by (from the textbook Elementary Differential Equations With Boundary Value Problems , sixth edition, Edwards and Penney, question 9 on page 246): $$y_2 \approx y_1 \left( \ln x - \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{5x^4}{128} - \frac{23x^6}{3456} \right).$$ In addition to this, I know there is a different way to go about this by using an integrating factor and doing some long division (through the method of reduction of order), and I do indeed get the correct answer. It's just that I would like to confirm why I'm getting the wrong coefficients here. The first coefficient $b_1$ is good, but the others don't match the solution above. Finally, I realize that this equation yields Bessel functions with imaginary arguments, but I'm looking for the actual terms using the above method.","['power-series', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'recursion']"
3106414,Fourier transform of $e^{-i\lambda\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ - asymptotics for $\lambda$?,"As the title says: I want to compute the Fourier transform (in the distributional sense) of $f(x)=e^{-i\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ , $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ - say $n=1$ for the moment. I have no idea how to get it done: I have tried with the usual machinery (""ODE approach"" like for the Gaussian, explicit computations, estimates for oscillatory integrals, complex analysis) but I am not able to come up with a useful suggestion.

Is there any result in order to connect this transform with the one of $e^{-i|x|}$ , at least in asymptotic terms? In fact, I am interested in an estimate for the parameter $\lambda >0$ in the Fourier transform of $f_{\lambda}(x)=e^{-i\lambda\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ .

Having only seen one proof of the theorem as part of an introduction to toric geometry that went somewhat over my head at the time, I'm curious how these proofs work. I'm especially interested in the ""can be explained to an advanced high-school student"" aspect, as I'm wondering if this might be good material for a math club talk to undergraduates or a week-long course for advanced high schoolers. However, I have no idea where any of these proofs would be documented, if they even are documented; some poking around on Math Reviews didn't turn up much.

[duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Maximum of the Variance Function for Given Set of Bounded Numbers (2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . What is the largest possible variance of a random variable on $[0; 1]$ ? It is evident that it does not exceed $1$ , but I doubt, that $1$ is actually possible. The largest variance, for which I found the example is $\frac{1}{4}$ . That is the variance of a random variable $X$ , such that $P(X = 1) = P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{2}$ , but I doubt that  it is the largest possible one. Why is it interesting: Initially I wanted to find the largest possible second moment of $X - Y$ , where $X$ and $Y$ are i.i.d. random variables on $[0; 1]$ . Then I found: $$E(X - Y)^2 = E(X^2 - 2XY + Y^2) = EX^2 - 2EXY + EY^2 = 2(EX^2 - EXY + EXY - EXEY + Cov(X, Y)) = 2(EX^2 - {(EX)}^2) = 2VarX$$ And thats where I am now.

3106649,"The spaces $\ell^p, \; 1 \leq p < + \infty$ are separable. On the other side, $\ell^\infty$ is not.","Exercise : Show that the spaces $\ell^p, \; 1 \leq p < + \infty$ are separable. Attempt : In order to show that $\ell^p$ is separable for $\ell^p, \; 1 \leq p < + \infty$ , we need to work over a set $D$ proving that it is countable and dense over $\ell^p$ , while showing that for $x \in \ell^P$ and $y \in D$ , it is $\|x-y\|<\varepsilon.$ Since $x \in \ell^p$ , where $x=(x_n)_{n}$ , this obviously means that : $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|^p <\infty \implies \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|^p \right)^{1/p} < \infty \implies \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|^p \right)^{1/p}<\varepsilon$$ $$\Leftrightarrow$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty |x_n|^p < \varepsilon^p, \quad \text{for some } \varepsilon >0$$ But that would mean that $\exists k \in \mathbb N$ , such that : $$\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty |x_n|^p < \left(\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right)^p$$ Now, if I let $y=(y_n)_n$ be the sequence $$y_n = \begin{cases} x_n& n \leq k \\ 0& n> k \end{cases}$$ then, one can easily see that : $$\left\| x-y\right\|_p = \left( \sum_{n=k+1}^\infty |x_n|^p \right)^{1/p}<\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$$ Now, let $D_n$ be the set : $$D_n = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n q_ie_i : q_i \in \mathbb Q \right\}$$ This set is countable as $D_n$ can be correlated to $\mathbb Q^n$ . Now, the union $$\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty D_n$$ is also countable as a union of countable sets. Now, it is : $$\|x-z\|_p \leq \|x-y\|_p + \|y-z\|_p < \varepsilon/2 + \varepsilon/2 \equiv \varepsilon$$ This means that $D = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty D_n$ is countable and dense over $\ell^p$ which means that $\ell^p$ is separable.

3106728,Random walk on thin ice?,"My Question: Is the stochastic process which is described below a (special case of a) well-studied model? What kind of properties are known under which assumptions? Let's think of a random walker on a frozen lake. Obviously, this lake is a subset $E$ of $\mathbb Z^n$ . The ice isn't too stable, though, and therefore our poor walker can occupy each vertex only $k\in\mathbb N$ times before the ice collapses. Luckily, the walker is quick and agile enough to leave the vertex before she is swallowed by the lake. However, she will no longer be able to visit this vertex, changing the rules for the future of her odyssey. I know that there is a huge community of probabilists who investigate random walks in random environments (and also environments that are randomly changing over time), so I'd be rather surprised if there were no results about this kind of process. The above description is intenionally vague: One might think of different asymmetry properties and different ways in which the ""weight"" of a removed vertex will be given to neighbouring (or maybe even more) vertices. The ""stability"" $k$ might depend on the site, and it might also be random. Lots of directions in which one might take this... Obvious questions about this process: What's the probability that the walker will eventually get trapped between collapsed vertices? If e.g. the lake $E$ is finite, the probability is obviously one. What about the expected time for this to happen? If $E=\mathbb Z^n$ , which recurrence properties (or general asymptotic properties) does the process have and in which sense?

Now one should prove that $f$ is surjective. $x \in X$ , $y \in Y$ One idea is:
to choose x = g(y) so f(x)=f(g(y)) and with IDy given above it follows that f(x)=y q.e.d.
But I think this isn't valid, because I need g to be a surjection for this and it is not given that it is one. Another idea is:
x=g(f(x)) I can say so because of the IDx relation given.
From that it follows that f(x)=f(g(f(x))) which transforms to f(x)=y with the IDy relation given.

3107335,Is the Lorenz system well-posed in the Hadamard sense?,"Apologies if this has already been discussed, but I searched the site and I couldn't find an answer. For the sake of simplicity, consider only ODEs, possibly depending on some vector of parameters $\mathbf{p}$ . The definition of a well-posed problem in the Hadamard sense is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-posed_problem The third point says that ""the solution's behavior changes continuously with the initial conditions"". I'm not sure what's the rigorous meaning of this. I interpret it as ""the integral operator which associates the forcing term, the parameters and the initial condition(s) to the solution of the ODE is continuous"", which seems to agree with the usual interpretation that ""small changes in the data lead to small changes in the solution"". However , the Lorenz system is usually considered ill-posed: see https://ac.els-cdn.com/089812219400188X/1-s2.0-089812219400188X-main.pdf?_tid=27b719d7-543e-4290-bfe6-e9d62887ba6c&acdnat=1549797064_ba8fd399224e0c3170aef5cc8ba4a182 Doesn't the solution depend continuously on data, though? Sure, changes $\epsilon$ in the initial conditions or in $\mathbf{p}$ will cause changes of order $\epsilon\exp(\lambda t)$ in time $t$ , which may be exponentially large, but they still depend continuously on $\epsilon$ , don't they? So, why would it be ill-posed? Also more recent paper seem to consider the Lorenz system ill-posed, though admittedly it's not stated explicitly: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85e5/908a9e21fb1c017c4206cf4df4475c89bdd8.pdf","['chaos-theory', 'stability-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'dynamical-systems']"

$$ I became intrigued by the algebraic patterns exhibited by traces of monomials in $X$ and $P$ . Before list them, let me define the degree in $X$ (or $P$ ) of a matrix $M$ written as monomial, $\text{deg}_X(M)$ , as the the sum of exponents of $X$ . For example, $\text{deg}_X(X^2PX^3P^7X)=6$ and $\text{deg}_P(X^2PX^3P^7X)=8$ . Now a partial list: The trace is nonzero only if the degree in $X$ and $P$ is even and it is always an integer. The trace is invariant if $X$ and $P$ are exchanged. So, for example, $\text{trace}(P^2)=\text{trace}(X^2)$ . For $3\times 3$ matrices, $\text{trace}(X^{2n})=\text{trace}(P^{2n})=2\cdot 3^n$ , where $n$ is positive. There is no direct generalization for bigger matrices. For $4\times 4$ matrices, for example, $\text{trace}(X^{2n})= 12, 60, 324, 1764$ with $n=1,2,3,4$ . For a $n\times n$ matrix monomial, $\text{trace}(X^2)=n\cdot(n-1)$ . For $2\times 2$ matrix monomials, the nonzero traces are always $\pm 2$ . If the degree in $X$ and $P$ are fixed, the monomials have different nonzero traces only if they cannot be transformed into each other by a cyclic permutation or an exchange of $X$ and $P$ . Thus, for example $\text{trace}(XPXP)=-2$ and $\text{trace}(X^2P^2)=10$ for $3\times 3$ matrix monomials.","['matrices', 'trace', 'linear-algebra', 'polynomials']"

Now let’s define scalar covariance of two random vectors $X$ and $Y$ as $Cov_H(X, Y) = E\langle X, Y\rangle - \langle E_HX, E_HY \rangle$ Is it always true, that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $Cov_H(X, Y) = 0$ ?

Further, Victor writes that Corollary 3.1 follows from using the lemma on $f(x) = g(x) \sin (\frac{\pi x}{a})$ with the half-angle formula $$ \tan \frac{x}{2} = \frac{\sin x}{1 + \cos x} $$ However, this is where my problems starts. Inserting in our values and using that $\cot x = 1/\tan x$ $$ \cot \bigl( \frac{\pi x}{a} \bigr) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\pi x/a)}{\sin(2\pi x/a)}$$ Inserting this into the lemma with $f = g \cdot \sin(\pi x/a)$ gives $$

How to construct such an example? This seems especially interesting when $k < \text{rank}(E)$ . Moreover generally , are there any non-trivial relations between the dimension of the space of parallel sections of $(E,\nabla)$ , and that of $(\bigwedge^k E, \bigwedge^k\nabla)$ (locally)? If there are $k$ independent parallel sections of $E$ , then $\bigwedge^k E$ has at least one parallel section; $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_k$ are parallel $\Rightarrow \sigma_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \sigma_k$ is parallel. What happens if $E$ has $r<k$ parallel sections? Does $\bigwedge^k E$ still admit (locally) a non-zero parallel section? Edit: We can probably use the relation between the curvatures: Let $X,Y \in \Gamma(TM)$ . Then $R^{ \bigwedge^k\nabla}(X,Y)=d\psi_{\operatorname{Id}}
(R^{\nabla}(X,Y)) $ , where $\psi:\text{End}(E) \to \text{End}(\bigwedge^k E)$ is the exterior power map, $\psi(A)=\bigwedge^k A$ . Since the dimension of the space of local parallel sections around $p \in M$ equals $\ker R(\cdot,\cdot)$ , it suffices to construct an example where $R^{\nabla}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is singular, but $R^{ \bigwedge^k\nabla}(\cdot,\cdot)$ is invertible.

I don't have an easy solution for the last equation and I feel that I'm complicating things unnecessarily. (It's a grade 10 geometry question). Edit: Using the fact $\tan(a+b) = \dfrac{\tan(a)+\tan(b)}{1-\tan(a)\tan(b)}$ yields the following quadratic equation $$2\tan(19)\tan^2(y)-\tan(y)+\tan(19) = 0$$ which gives you that $\tan(y) = 0.890833$ or $\tan(y)= 0.561272$ which means $x = 27\times0.890833$ or $x= 27\times 0.561272$ .

I set $\displaystyle{ {a_n} = \frac{1}{n}}$ which monotonically decreases and has a limit of zero.

3107668,Intersection of any function and a circle,"I wanted to know how to find a specific angle based on a function and a circle intersection.
To understand, you first need to see the drawing : What I want is to find the smaller alpha angle possible value where the arc-circle drawn by this angle 'cut' a random function. The origin of the circle is $O(0, 0)$ and the radius is $1$ ( but I don't think the radius would impact the calcul ). I first thought about how I could find this angle if the function was linear: $y=ax+b$ . When $a \ne 0$ there are some equations : $ax + b = 0$ $x^2+y^2=R^2$ (with R the circle radius) $\cos{\alpha}=x$ $\sin{\alpha}=f(x)$ and the solutions are : $$x = {-ab \pm \sqrt{-b^2+R^2+a^2R^2} \over 1+a^2}.$$ This worked with $R = 1$ . You just have to set $\alpha=\arccos{x}$ . So I thought about guessing the intersection between the tangent of the function at the value $a.$ This gave me two equations : $y=f(x)$ and $x^2+y^2=R^2.$ The first gives that  tangent line : $y = xf'(x)+(f(a)-f'(x)a)$ . So I solved the same system and found : $$x = {-f'(x)[f(a)-f'(x)a] \pm \sqrt{-[f(a)-f'(x)a]^2+R^2+f'(a)^2R^2} \over 1+f'(a)^2}.$$ This equation is true when $f(x) = ax + b$ , because if you replace everything by those values, you get the previous correct equation.
But this new $x$ value is not right and I don't know why.... Maybe there is an easier way to solve my problem... Anyway thanks for trying helping me :). Edit 1 : An algorithm will do the job too if the mathematical solution is too hard to find (I'm using Java). Edit 2 : So, since there is an infinite number of possibilities which may answer the question as impossible, do you think there is an algorithm capable to find that angle ?","['trigonometry', 'angle', 'geometry']"

3107806,Identification of the tangent space of a manifold and the tangent vectors to curves,"I'm studying the different definitions of the tangent space for abstract manifolds, and I'm struggling to prove that these abstract concepts reduce to the classical ones when dealing with submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . What I know: The tangent space $T_pM$ can be defined as the space of all equivalence classes of curves $\gamma:(-\epsilon, \epsilon)\to M$ with $\gamma(0)=p$ under the equivalence relation $$ \gamma \sim \beta \quad\iff\quad (\mathbf{x}^{-1}\circ\gamma)'(0) = (\mathbf{x}^{-1}\circ\beta)'(0), $$ where $\mathbf{x}$ is a local chart of $M$ at $p$ . This is easily shown to be independent of the chosen chart. The tangent space $T_pM$ can also be defined as the space or all derivations $D$ which are linear functionals obeying the Leibniz rule, which act on the space of smooth functions defined locally around $p$ . I know how to prove that the latter two are equivalent (in the sense that the spaces are isomorphic), and related by $$ [\gamma]\mapsto \left(f \mapsto (f\circ\gamma)'(0)\right), $$ where the latter map can be thought of as the directional derivative with respect to $[\gamma]$ I also know that they are both isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ . For the the differential of a smooth map $\varphi:M\to N$ , I use the definition using derivations derivations, i.e. $$\mathrm d\varphi_p(X)(f) = X(f\circ \varphi).$$ I know how to prove the chain rule and I also know that the differential $\mathrm d\varphi_p$ is an isomorphism whenever the map $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism. What I don't know how to prove: If $M$ is a submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ , the tangent space $T_pM$ is isomorphic to the space of all tangents $\dot\gamma(0)\in \mathbb{R}^n$ of curves $\gamma$ passing through $p$ ? I can intuitively see why this should be the case given the information that I have, but I don't know how to write a proper proof of it. One of the ideas is to show that two curves belong to the same equivalence class if and only if their tangent vectors at $p$ coincide, in which case I could do something as shown in this post . However, with my definition of the differential I do not directly see that $$ (\mathbf{x}^{-1}\circ\gamma)'(0) = \mathrm d\mathbf{x}^{-1}_p(\dot\gamma(0)). $$ That being said, I would guess that one can use the aforementioned isomorphisms to identify the differential with a map that operates in this way. Another idea would be to prove that the directional derivative with respect to $[\gamma]$ actually coincides with the tangent vector $\dot\gamma(0)$ , but I don't see how one can do this. Could you help me with this? EDIT: I have added a bounty. Let me know if my question is unclear or missing any of the details. EDIT 2: After thinking about this a bit more, I don't think it is possible to show what I'm trying to show without first defining the tangent space and the differential for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the natural way (i.e. using tangents to curves) and showing that the differential of a chart is an isomorphism, and then using that fact to show that all of the new notions reduce to the classical ones.
I would love to be wrong regarding this though.","['manifolds', 'tangent-spaces', 'differential-geometry']"

Given a handle decomposition for the cobordism, the Whitney trick is used to eliminate every pair of intersection points with opposite sign between the belt sphere of a $k$ -handle and the attaching sphere of a $k+1$ -handle attached to it. Essentially the statement is: given two transversally intersecting submanifold $P^p$ , $Q^q$ of complementary dimensions in a simply connected smooth manifold $M^{p+q}$ , suppose also that $n\ge 2, m\ge 3$ . If $x',x''$ are two points in the intersection with opposite signs then there exists an isotopy $\varphi_t$ of $\text{Id}_M$ such that $\varphi_1(P)\cap Q=P\cap Q\setminus \{x',x''\}$ We have two arcs respectively in $P$ and $Q$ connecting the points $x',x''$ . Together they form a 2-dimentional disc $D$ and the idea of the trick is to ""push"" $P$ along this disc. Rigorously, Scorpan says that all we want is to show that the normal bundle $N_{D/M}$ of $D$ in $M$ splits in one part tangent to $P$ and normal to $Q$ and another normal to $P$ and tangent to $Q$ .

3108085,Why is the volume element unique in the way Spivak develops it?,"In Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds, he develops the volume element in the following way: The fact that $\dim \Lambda^n(\mathbb{R}^n) = 1$ is probably not new to you, since det is often defined as the unique element $\omega \in \Lambda^n(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $\omega (e_1, \ldots, e_n) = 1$ . For a general vector space $V$ there is no extra criterion of this sort to distinguish a particular $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$ . Suppose, however, that an inner product $T$ for $V$ is given. If $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ are two bases which are orthonormal with respect to $T$ , and the matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is defined by $w_i = \sum_{j=1} ^n a_{ij}v_j,$ then $$\delta_{ij} = T(w_i, w_j) = \sum_{k,l = 1} ^n a_{ik}a_{jl}T(v_k,v_l) =\sum_{k=1} ^na_{ik}a_{jk}.$$ In other words, if $A^T$ denotes the transpose of the matrix $A$ , then we have $A \cdot A^T = I$ , so $\det A = \pm 1$ . It follows from Theorem 4-6 (stated below) that if $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$ satisfies $\omega (v_1, \ldots, v_n) = \pm 1$ , then $\omega (w_1, \ldots, w_n) = \pm 1$ . If an orientation $\mu$ for $V$ has also been given, it follows that there is a unique $\omega \in \Lambda^n(V)$ such that $\omega (v_1,\ldots, v_n) = 1$ whenever $v_1, \ldots,v_n$ is an orthonormal basis such that $[v_1, \ldots, v_n] = \mu.$ This unique $\omega$ is called the volume element of $V$ , determined by the inner product $T$ and orientation $\mu$ . Theorem 4-6: Let $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ be a basis for $V$ , and let $\omega \in \Lambda^n (V)$ . If $w_i = \sum_{j = 1}^na_{ij}v_j$ are $n$ vectors in $V$ , then $$\omega (w_1, \ldots, w_n) = det (a_{ij}) \cdot \omega (v_1, \ldots, v_n)$$ Two questions: Why is $\omega$ unique? Is it because $\dim \Lambda^n(V) = 1$ so every other element is $c \cdot \omega$ for some $c$ ? What exactly is the role of the inner product in determining the volume element? Is it so that an orthonormal basis can be determined? Why are orthonormal bases important in this development?","['volume', 'tensors', 'multivariable-calculus', 'linear-algebra', 'exterior-algebra']"

If each $A_i = \{i, i+1, \dots, i + n/2\}$ , then choosing $T$ to be every 4th integer would do the trick; that is, we can let $T = \{1,5,9,13,\dots\}$ .

A N-mover is a knight-like piece that can move to any square that has a Euclidean distance of $\sqrt{N}$ from its current square. That is, it can move from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$ if and only if $x^2 + y^2 = N$ (And of course $x$ and $y$ need to be integers). For example, a 1-mover can move to any of the four adjacent grids, and a 5-mover is a regular chess knight. Consider an infinite board. Starting from a given grid, what proportion of the infinite grid can a N-mover reach? For clarity, let's say the answer is defined as $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\text{The number of grids }(x,y)\text{ with }|x|,|y|<=n\text{ and reachable from }(0,0)}{(2n+1)^2}$$ Some thoughts: If we treat each grid and possible move as a Gaussian integer, the reachable grids are sums of Gaussian integer multiples of the moves (we can multiply by $i$ because our set of moves is 4-fold rotational symmetric). Using Bezout's identity, they are the multiples of the GCD. Therefore, the answer should be $1/|d|^2$ where $d$ is the GCD of the moves if there are possible moves, or 0 otherwise. Let's call the answer $f(N)$ .

Furthermore the cycle structure and spectrum of $\pi^n_m$ can be visualized and related to number theoretic facts about $n$ and $m$ . This is how the graph for $\mu_{3\ \mathsf{ mod }\  64}(k) = 3k\ \ \mathsf{ mod }\  \ 64$ looks like when highlighting permutation cycles (the shorter the stronger): When visualizing the function $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}(k) = k^2\ \ \mathsf{ mod }\  \ m$ (which gives the quadratic residue of $k$ modulo $m$ ) in the same way as a graph, other observations can be made and tried to relate to facts of number theory, esp. modular arithmetic: These graphs are not as symmetric and regular than the graphs for $\mu_{n\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}$ but observations can be made nevertheless: the image of ${f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}}$ , i.e. those $n$ with ${f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}}(k) = n$ for some $k < m$ (black dots) number and distribution of fixed points with ${f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}}(k) = k$ (fat black dots) cycles with ${f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}}^{(n)}(k) = k$ (colored lines) parallel lines (not highlighted) My questions are: How can the symmetric distribution of image points $n$ (with $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  61}(k)=n$ for some $k$ , black dots in the picture below) be explained? Can there be more than one cycle of length greater than 1 for $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  m}$ ? How does the length of the cycles depend on $m$ ? How does the ""parallel structure"" depend on $m$ ? With ""parallel structure"" I mean the number and size of groups of parallel lines. For example, $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  8}$ has two groups of two parallel lines, $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  12}$ has two groups of three parallel lines. $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  9}$ has no parallel lines. For $f^2_{\ \mathsf{ mod }\  61}$ one finds at least four groups of at least two parallel lines: For other prime numbers $m$ one finds no parallel lines at all, esp. for all primes $m\leq 11$ (for larger ones it is hard to tell).","['modular-arithmetic', 'number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory', 'visualization', 'quadratic-residues']"

3109299,A continuous curve intersects its 90 degrees rotated copy?,"This is almost the same problem as in this question . However, the OP there was looking for a solution where we could assume any number of things, while I want to stick with just the given assumption (continuity). All the answers there addressed the OP's intent, making certain assumptions that might not be necessary. So none of them apply here. Here's the question: A continuous, injective curve $C$ goes from $(-1,-1)$ to $(1,1)$ in the Euclidean plane. Rotating $C$ in either direction by $90$ degrees with respect to the origin, we obtain a new curve $C'$ from $(-1,1)$ to $(1,-1)$ . Prove that there exists a point $X$ that lies on both $C$ and $C'$ . In the linked question, the accepted answer by Arthur assumes every straight line through the origin intersects $C$ at exactly one point (of course, except the  line $y=x$ ), and that $C$ goes strictly counterclockwise. Assuming these, he provides a proof. The other two answers are incomplete, each missing a case that they did not discuss. Here's an approach that seems promising. Look at $C$ as a set of points, which we represent in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$ . There exists a point $P_0=(r_0,\theta_0)$ so that $r(P)\geq r_0$ for all $P\in C$ (by continuity), and similarly we have a upper bound with $P_1=(r_1,\theta_1)$ . If we assume that there exists precisely two points in $C$ of distance $r$ to the origin for every $r$ so that $r_0<r<r_1$ , then the difference of their $\theta$ s is uniquely determined by $r$ . Let's call this number $\theta(r)$ . Since $\theta(\sqrt2)=\pi>\pi/2$ and $\theta(r_0)=0<\pi/2$ , and $\theta$ is continuous, by IVT there is some $r$ so that $\theta(r)=\pi/2$ . So we have a point on $C$ which is exactly $90$ degrees away from another point on $C$ of the same distance to the origin. Hence, rotating this point by $90$ degrees, the result still stays on the curve. We are done. This approach still assumes more than just continuity. In particular, it is not in general true that there are exactly $2$ points of each $r$ on $C$ . If we don't assume that, this proof breaks down since $r$ does not determine $\theta$ .

Drawing any function $f(x)$ through those 2 points, the function must have an average velocity over $[x_1,x_2]$ of $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ . However, the area bounded by the line and $f(x)$ can vary greatly, and what I'm trying to find is the relationship between $f'(x)$ and that area. I'm not sure about how to formally express this next part, but as the average velocity of both the line and function over $[x_1,x_2]$ is the same, the average of the sum of the values of $f'(x)$ at all the infinite points on $f(x)$ over the domain $[x_1,x_2]$ will be the same as the average of the sum of the slope/value of the line's derivative at all the infinite points the line in the domain $[x_1,x_2]$ . However, the actual values of $f'(x)$ could vary significantly. Visually, it appears the greater the greatest y-value of $f'(x)$ over $[x_1,x_2]$ , the greater the area if $f(x)$ has no stationary points in the domain $[x_1,x_2]$ . For example, with the line segment with endpoints $(0,0)$ and $(2,4)$ , and the function $f(x)=x^\frac{3}{2}*\sqrt{2}$ , the area bounded by $y=2x$ and $f(x)$ is $\frac{16-2\sqrt{2}}{5}$ , and the greatest y-value of $f'(x)$ over $[1,2]$ is 3. If $f(x)=\frac{x^3}{2}$ , then the area bounded is 4, and the greatest y-value of $f'(x)$ over $[0,2]$ is 6. Am I correct in saying that the greater the greatest y-value of $f'(x)$ over $[x_1,x_2]$ , the greater the area bounded, if $f(x)$ does not have stationary points in the domain $[x_1,x_2]$ ? And if so, does there exist a relation that, given a line segment over $[x_1,x_2]$ , can give the area bounded by the line segment and $f(x)$ , given only the greatest y-value of $f'(x)$ over $[x_1,x_2]$ ?
