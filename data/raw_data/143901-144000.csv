2341172,Fitting subgroup is abelian and has complement if the mother group is Frattini free,"I am currently reading on some theorems about relations between finite group and its largest cardinality of independent generating sequence. One assumed-well-known result is that if given a finite Frattini free group $G$ (Frattini free means the intersection of all maximal subgroups is trivial), then the Fitting subgroup $F(G)$ is abelian and complemented. Also, $F(G)$ is a direct product of minimal normal subgroups of G. Definition: if $G$ is finite, then the Fitting subgroup is the subgroup generated by all nilpotent normal subgroups of G. Currently, I do not know why the result stated above is true. Any comment or guide is greatly appreciated.","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'generating-functions', 'group-theory', 'linear-algebra']"

2341274,Automorphisms of $\mathbb{A}^1_R$,"When $R$ is an integral domain, the automorphisms of the affine line are all of the form $X \mapsto aX + b$ with $a \in R^\times$ and $b \in R$; the proof is the same as in the case of $R$ a field, see this answer . It is easy to see that this group of maps is isomorphic to the semidirect product $R^\times \! \rtimes R^+$. This paper by Dupuy studies the case where $R$ is not reduced. In particular, he proves that the group 
$\text{Aut}(\mathbb{A}^1_{\mathbb{Z}/m})$ is solvable, for arbitrary m. What other properties does it have? Is there an explicit description of this group? For example, with a bit of playing around I found that $\varphi(X) = X + 2X^2$ is an involutive automorphism of $(\mathbb{Z}/4)[X]$: 
$$\varphi^2(X) = (X + 2X^2) + 2(X + 2X)^2 = X + 4X^2 + 4X^3 + 8X^4$$
which reduces to $X$ when we take the coefficients mod 4. But I could not generalize this example to the ring $R = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$. Also, what can be said in the case that $R$ is reduced but not integral? E.g. $\mathbb{Z}[X,Y]/(XY)$ or $\mathbb{Z}/6$.","['polynomials', 'algebraic-geometry', 'automorphism-group', 'affine-geometry', 'affine-schemes']"
2341279,Combinations: Drawing marbles from a bag,"Problem I'm told that a bag of marbles contains $10$ red and $5$ white marbles. Each of the red and white marbles is numbered such that they are distinct within their own groups, i.e. $R = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j\}$ $W = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ I'm asked to calculate how many combinations there are if I am to select $4$ marbles from the bag but at least one of them must be a red marble. Attempt If there is at least $1$ marble, then that is $10$ choose $1$, which is just $10$. Afterwards, we are left with $14$ marbles in total and need to choose $3$ of them, which is $364$. Multiplying by $10$, I get $3,640$, but the answer key says it's supposed to be $1,360$. Where did I go wrong?

2341307,Maximum modulus principle for several variables,"The goal is to prove the following. Theorem : Let $f: U \subset \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function and $w=(w_1,...,w_n)\in U$ such that $w$ is a local maximum for $|f|$. Then there exists a polydisc $D=D_1 \times ... \times D_n$ around $w$ such that $f$ is constant on $D$ . My approach was to rewrite $f=(f_1,...,f_n)$ with $f_i : U_i \subset \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ all holomorphic such that the $|f_i|$ admit $w_i$ as a maximum on some $D_i \subset U_i$ for all $i=1,...,n$. By the usual maximum modulus principle the $f_i$ would be constant on $D_i$ for all $i$, and it would follow that $f$ is constant on $D=D_1 \times ... \times D_n$. However, actually finding the functions $f_i$ has proven to be more difficult than expected, which makes me suspect that this very naive approach maybe isn't the best one.

2341389,Help with a differential equation using variation of parameters,"I've been asked to find the general solution of this system: $\begin{cases} x_1'= -x_2 + 2 \\ 
 x_2'= 2x_1 +3x_2 +t\end{cases}$ So, we have been working on this with a friend and were wondering if there's a better method to solve it. We wanted to used variations of parameters. To start with, we found the eigenvalues: $\lambda_1= \frac {3+\sqrt17}{2}$ $\lambda_2=\frac {3-\sqrt17}{2}$ Then, we computed the eigenvectors and found the $X_h$, the homogenous solution. With that, we set out to find $X_p(t$), by solving $Q(t).C'(t)=b(t)$ where $X_p$ stands for a particular solution. We learned that we need to find $C(t)$ to get $X_p(t)= Q(t).C(t)$ in order to, finally, get the general solution, $X_g$, where $X_g= X_p + X_h$. In our case, we had: $
e^{\frac{3}{2}t}\left(\begin{matrix}
2e^{\frac {\sqrt 17}{2}t} & 2e^{-\frac {\sqrt 17}{2}t} \\
(3+\sqrt 17) e^{\frac {\sqrt 17}{2} t}&(3-\sqrt 17) e^{-\frac {\sqrt 17}{2}t}\\
\end{matrix}\right)$. $\left(\begin{matrix} c_1' \\ c_2'\\ \end{matrix}\right) =\left(\begin{matrix} 2 \\ t\\ \end{matrix}\right)$ I prefer to avoid the rest of the computations, I believe they are unnecessarily complicated and you don't need to see them to understand the point. In short, we found ourselves dealing with a pretty complicated integral to find $C(t)$ and very long computations and started wondering if we were mistaking somewhere or if maybe there's a better method than this one.

2341460,Upper Bound for Vertices of Intersection of Subspace and Simplex,"Let $S$ be a simplex in $\mathbb R^m$. It can be expressed as the convex hull of the columns of some affinely independent $m \times m + 1$ matrix $A$: $$S=\left\{A\vec\alpha: \vec\alpha\in\mathbb R^{m+1},\alpha_i\ge0,\sum\alpha_i=1\right\}$$ Or alternately by the intersection of a set of $m + 1$ half-spaces defined by the rows of a matrix $C$, where each row $\vec c$ gives $\vec c^T \vec x \le 1$. (This requires that the origin be in the interior of the simplex, but that can be done without loss of generality). $$S=\left\{\vec x\in\mathbb R^{m}:C\vec x\leqq 1\right\}$$ Let $Q$ be a subspace of dimension $n<m$, expressed  in terms of a linearly independent basis: $$Q=span\left\{\vec v_1,\vec v_2,...,\vec v_n\right\}=\left\{V\vec y:\vec y\in\mathbb R^n\right\}$$ If the intersection $Q\cap S$ contains a point in the interior of $S$, then it can be expressed as a convex hull in $Q$. From low dimensional cases, it is clear that there are some restrictions on its geometry. In particular, I am interested in the number of vertices. I believe the best lower bound is $n+1$; that is the minimum for any convex hull in $n$ dimensions, and one can be obtained in any dimension by construction. The the upper bound is much less clear. At $m=3, n=2$ (a plane intersecting a tetrahedron), the lower bound is 3 and the upper bound is 4, since the planar cross sections of a tetrahedron are either triangles or quadrilaterals. However, it's not clear to me how this argument generalizes to higher dimensions. The best general upper bound I could come up with is $\binom{m+1}{n}$, which follows from this argument: The set of $\vec y$ coordinates has the same topology as the hull in $\mathbb R^m$, so we can look at the hull in that space, again assuming that the origin is an interior point. $$Q\cap S = \left\{V\vec y: \vec y \in \mathbb R^n, CV\vec y\leqq 1\right\}$$ $CV$ is an $m+1\times n$ matrix, so this equation describes the intersection of $m+1$ half spaces in $\mathbb R^n$. Some of them could be redundant, but we can assume that none are to obtain an upper bound on vertices. Since this hull exists in $n$ dimensions, each vertex lies at the intersection of the boundaries of at least $n$ half spaces in order to be fully determined. If it is in the intersection of more than $n$ half spaces, we can find a subset of exactly $n$ whose intersection is the vertex. Thus if we consider every combination of $n$ half spaces, we will obtain all the vertices, which gives an upper bound of $\binom{m + 1}{n}$ vertices. It seems like there ought to exist a better upper bound. This one gives more vertices than can possibly be attained for the low dimensional cases $(m=2, n=1)$, $(m=3, n=1)$, and($m=3, n=2)$. Any input on how best to improve this bound (or show it can't be inproved) would be much appreciated. A more general result would be preferred, but I'm primarily interested in the case $m>>n>>1$.","['combinatorial-geometry', 'simplex', 'linear-algebra']"

Happy to delete this question, if it is just noise. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// By Danny Chan: I rephrase your question: Let $F:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow[0,1]$ be a distribution function with $F(0)=0$. Let $K>0$. Prove that $\int_{0}^{\infty}(K-t)^{+}dF(t)=\int_{0}^{K}F(t)dt.$ Proof:
Let $A=\{(x,y)\mid0<y\leq x\leq K\}$ be the triangular region with vertices
$(0,0)$, $(K,0)$, and $(K,K)$. Clearly $A$ is a Borel subset of
$\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let $\mu$ be the probability measure on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$
induced by $F$. That is, $\mu((-\infty,x])=F(x)$, for any $x\in\mathbb{R}$.
Let $m$ be the usual Lebesgue measure on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.
Note that the product sigma algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$
coincides with $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$. Consider the product
measure space $(\mathbb{R}^{2},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^{2}),m\times\mu)$.
By Tonelli-Fubini Theorem, we have 
$$
\int1_{A}d(m\times\mu)=\int\!\int1_{A}(x,y)\,dm(x)d\mu(y)=\int\!\int1_{A}(x,y)\,d\mu(y)dm(x).
$$ Note that the second integral is equal to $\int_{(0,K]}(K-y)\,d\mu(y)=\int_{[0,\infty)}(K-y)^{+}dF(y)$
(observe that $\mu(\{0\})=0)$, while the third integral is equal
to $\int_{0}^{K}\mu((0,x])\,dm(x)=\int_{0}^{K}F(x)\,dx$. Hence we have: $\int_{0}^{\infty}(K-t)^{+}\,dF(t)=\int_{0}^{K}F(t)\,dt$.","['probability-theory', 'definite-integrals', 'probability-distributions']"

2341639,Proof verification - A specific function $f$ has non-zero derivative at $0$ but is not monotone in any interval around $0$,"Here's a problem on a function that has non-zero derivative at the point $0,$ but is not monotone in any interval around the point $0$. I'm stating the problem and presenting my solution to it. I'd greatly appreciate if someone checks the solution and tell me if there's any gap in my arguments. Also, is there any method/trick that may enable me produce a shorter solution? Thank you. The Problem : Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be given by
  $f(x)=
\begin{cases} 
      x+2x^2sin\Big(\frac{1}{x}\Big) & x\neq 0 \\
      0 & x=0
\end{cases}
$ To show that $f'(0)=1,$ but $f$ is not monotonic in any interval around $0$. My Solution : We see that $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}=\lim_{x \to 0;~x \neq 0} \frac{f(x)}{x}=\lim_{x \to 0;~x \neq 0} \frac{x+2x^2sin\big(\frac{1}{x}\big)}{x}=1+2\lim_{x \to 0}xsin\Big(\frac{1}{x}\Big)$ We first find out $\lim_{x \to 0}xsin\Big(\frac{1}{x}\Big)$. Let $\epsilon>0.$ Choose $\delta=\epsilon$. Then
$$x \in (-\delta,\delta)\setminus\{0\} \implies \left| xsin\Big(\frac{1}{x}\Big)-0 \right| \leq |x| < \delta=\epsilon$$
Since $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary, $\lim_{x \to 0}xsin\Big(\frac{1}{x}\Big)=0$. And hence, $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x-0}$ exists and is equal to $1+(2 \times 0)=1$. Thus $f'(0)=1$. Now, let $\alpha>0$ be arbitrary. By Archimedean Property $2,$ $\exists N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{1}{N}<2\pi\alpha,$ i.e. $\frac{1}{2\pi N}<\alpha$. Choose $x_1=\frac{1}{2\pi N},~x_2=\frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}},~x_3=\frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{3\pi}{2}}$. Then, $x_1>x_2>x_3$.

Then,
\begin{align}
f(x_1) \geq f(x_2) &\iff \frac{1}{2\pi N} \geq \frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}+2\Big(\frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}\Big)^2\\
&\iff \frac{1}{2\pi N} - \frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}} \geq 2\Big(\frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}\Big)^2\\
&\iff \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}}{(2\pi N)(2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2})} \geq 2\Big(\frac{1}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}\Big)^2\\
&\iff \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}}{2\pi N} \geq \frac{2}{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}\\
&\iff \frac{2\pi N+\frac{\pi}{2}}{2\pi N} \geq \frac{2}{\frac{\pi}{2}}\\
&\iff 1+\frac{1}{4N} \geq \frac{4}{\pi}\\
&\iff \frac{1}{4N} \geq \frac{4}{\pi}-1=\frac{4-\pi}{\pi}\\
&\iff 4N \leq \frac{\pi}{4-\pi} < 4\\

& \implies N<1
\end{align} And we reach a contradiction. Hence $f(x_1)<f(x_2)$. Thus the claim is true. We have $x_1,x_2,x_3 \in (0,\alpha)$ such that $x_1>x_2>x_3$ and $f(x_3)<f(x_1)<f(x_2)$. We conclude that $f$ is not monotone in $(0,\alpha),$ and hence in $(-\alpha,\alpha)$. Since $\alpha>0$ is arbitrary, $f$ is not monotone in any interval around $0$. $\blacksquare$","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'monotone-functions', 'proof-verification']"

Should the denominator in the integrand not be $\sqrt{1-w^2}\sqrt{1-k^2w^2}$ for that to happen? And if so, why is the elliptic integral always shown without this additional separated square root? As it is now it seems not even to be analytic in $\mathbb{H}$. And furthermore, if we wish to have continuity in the closure of the upper half-plane $\overline{\mathbb{H}}$ --- something which is explicitly used in a couple of arguments I have seen ---, do we not really need the even further separated $k\sqrt{1+w}\sqrt{1-w}\sqrt{\frac{1}{k}+w}\sqrt{\frac{1}{k}-w}$ as denominator, like in the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping formula?

The motivation is utility maximization from economics. Suppose the target goal is to maximize the terminal wealth $u(W_T)$, where $u$ is a utility function and $W_T$ is denoting the terminal wealth at time $T$. Formally, we want to maximize $$ \max E[u(W_T)]$$ where the max is taken over the allocation to different assets $x$. The wealth evolves as $W_{t+1}= W_t + \langle x_t, R_t\rangle$ where $x_t$ is the allocation at time $t$ and $R_t$ is the return (random) of the different assets. There might be some linear constraints which are not that important for my question. One approach to solve this problem and find the correct allocation over time is to use dynamic programming. For this problem the Bellman equation turns into
$$V_{t}(W_{t}) = \max_{x} E[V_{t+1}(W_{t+1})|W_t]$$
With $V_T = u$. Now, often it is assumed that $u$ is concave. My question is whether all other value function $V_i$ resulting from the optimization are then concave as well.

Then is there necessarily a finite vector space $V$ containing $X$ and a finite vector space $W$ containing $Y$ so that $f$ is the restriction of a linear transformation $\phi : V^n \to W$? The $n=1$ case is pretty easy : just let $V$ be the free $K$-vector space on $X$, where $K$ is any finite field, and let $W$ be any $K$-vector space containing $Y$; since $X$ is now a basis of $V$, then $f : X^n \to Y$ automatically extends linearly to a (unique) linear transformation $V^n \to W$. Does the same kind of result hold for $n > 1$? If $X$ and $Y$ do not embed in vector spaces so that $f$ extends to a linear transformation, then can we relax the requirements and instead just require that $X$ and $Y$ embed in finite abelian groups so that $f$ extends to a group homomorphism? It seems that the naive attempt of letting $V$ again be a free vector space over $X$, and then extending $f$ to a map $V^n \to W$, where $W$ just contains $Y$, does not work, since $V^n$ is of dimension $n\left|X\right|$, while $\left|X^n\right| = \left|X\right|^n$ instead; and if we instead say that $V^n$ itself should be a free vector space over $X^n$, then this would require that $\dim V = \frac{1}{n}\left|X\right|^n$, so in particular we have an unnatural requirement that $n | \left|X\right|^n.$","['abstract-algebra', 'elementary-set-theory']"

2341962,Some questions on complex determinants and flat connections on a $U(1)$ bundle,"Inspired by Geometric interpretation of the determinant of a complex matrix , I ask the following related questions. The complex determinant is determined up to a global scaling factor by the fact that it is multilinear and skew-symmetric. Let us try to understand the phase of the determinant. For that purpose, let us restrict our attention to $G = U(n)$. Let $E = G \times U(1)$ be the trivial $U(1)$ bundle over $G$. Let $T$ denote a maximal torus of $G$; to fix the ideas, let us assume it is the one consisting of all diagonal matrices in $G$. Let $N(T)$ denote the normalizer of $T$ in $G$. $N(T)$ is the semi-direct product of $T$ with the symmetric group $S_n$ ($S_n$ is the full permutation group on $n$ elements). We can now say that the determinant is a global smooth section $s$ of $E$ over $G$ which is further $N(T)$-equivariant. Question 1: do these properties determine $s$ up to a global phase factor? If we let $\nabla$ denote the unique flat connection on $E$ which makes the actual determinant function parallel (i.e. covariantly constant) everywhere, then if we require that the section $s$ be covariantly constant with respect to $\nabla$, then we recover the determinant function uniquely up to a global phase factor, and the symmetry properties under $N(T)$ are automatically satisfied. What remains to be done, is to describe this flat connection $\nabla$ on $E$ in a way that does not involve the determinant function, so as to avoid circularity. What we know about $\nabla$ is that it is a flat connection on the trivial $U(1)$ bundle $E$ over $G = U(n)$, such that there exists a global parallel section $s$, unique up to a global phase factor, which is equivariant under $N(T)$. Question 2: how can $\nabla$ be the defined directly (say using Maurer-Cartan 1-forms and geometric things like that)? Edit: The whole point of my post, is to be able to define the determinant function on $U(n)$, simply as a parallel section (parallel with respect to the connection $\nabla$) which has the value 1 at the identity.","['connections', 'differential-geometry', 'determinant']"

You flip a fair coin $n = 10$ times and get $7$ heads and $3$ tails, which suggests a relatively low $p$ -value. But as you flip this coin more times (say $n = 100$ ) and now get $45$ heads and $55$ tails, your $p$ -value increases - which results in you being more likely to fail to reject the null over the alternative hypothesis.

when $r$ lies between $0$ and $1$ (we use continuity to extend this result to irrationals) and for $x\geq -1$. Besides being quite sharp, this inequality also wraps up the case of equality in the more canonical Bernoulli's Inequality. Naturally, this result begs to have a dual proved. That is, can we
  find a function $f$ and a constant $C_r$ such that $$(1+x)^r\geq 1+rx+C_r(f(x))^2$$ where $r>1$, $x\geq -1$, $C_r>0$ is allowed to
  depend on $r$, and $f$ has a unique root at $0$? The thought that occurred to me was to choose the positive integer $n$ such that $n-1\leq r<n$ and then apply the previous result to
$$\left(1+\frac{r}{n}x\right)^{n/r}=\left(1+\frac{r}{n}x\right)^{(n-1)/r}\left(1+\frac{r}{n}x\right)^{1/r}$$
and hopefully take powers and apply the integer form of Bernoulli to the left-hand side. The algebra have proved tedious and subtle however. I've thought about trudging through the Taylor Formula for $(1+x)^r$ (Newton's binomial expansion), but the case analysis on $r$ and $x$ doesn't seem fruitful or pretty.","['real-analysis', 'inequality']"

2342073,Non-Hausdorff locally compact topological field,"Do non-Hausdorff locally compact topological fields exist? If so, what is an example? Edit: In light of Daniel Fischer's comment, I need to add the condition that topology not be the trivial $\{X,\emptyset\}$ topology. Context: X is locally compact if every point of X has a compact neighbourhood. (A neighbourhood of a point is a set containing an open set which contains the point.) A topological group $G$ is Hausdorff if and only if the subgroup containing only the identity $\{e\}$ is closed. $G/\overline{\{e\}}$ is Hausdorff, so some authors just assume Hausdorff when discussing topological groups. Commonly (wikipedia, Taibelson's book, etc) a local field is defined as a locally compact topological field, and it is proved that every local field has an absolute value (induced by the unique-up-to-multiplicative-factor property of Haar measure) and is therefore Hausdorff. But the usual proofs of the existence of Haar measure require the locally compact topological group to be Hausdorff. So it seems to me that the usual definition of local field assumes Hausdorff (otherwise I am not sure how to construct the Haar measure with the unique-up-to-multiplicative-factor property). Thus I am wondering if non-Hausdorff locally compact topological fields exist. I looked in various books and googled around before asking. Related: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/22800/must-a-locally-compact-group-be-hausdorff-in-order-to-possess-a-haar-measure Daniel Fischer has pointed out that any field with the trivial (indiscrete, only open sets are whole space and empty set) topology is a non-Hausdorff compact topological field. He also pointed out that the $T_0$ axiom must be avoided to get non-Hausdorff. Here's a candidate non-$T_0$ topology (from wikipedia)to put on the field $\mathbb{C}=\mathbb{R}^2$: Open sets are the Cartesian product of an open set in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ itself, i.e., the product topology of $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology and $\mathbb{R}$ with the trivial topology; points $(a,b)$ and $(a,c)$ are not distinguishable.","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"

But I'm not so sure that the opposite holds. Perhaps if our synthetic geometry had a notion of measure with the entire set of real numbers, we could use that to ""mimic"" the coordinate system. However, if it didn't have any sort of measurement (i.e. Hilbert's axiomatization), I'm thinking that maybe you could take a line segment to be the ""unit length"", and somehow construct the rational lengths and some irrational lengths. The problem is, I don't know whether being able to give coordinate names to points actually gives us any power to carry out analytical proofs. 
Also, we won't even have the entire real line using this method, since there are numbers that aren't constructible. So essentially what I'm asking is: Is synthetic geometry logically complete? Moreover, is it possible to mimic analytic proofs in coordinates by constructing a coordinate system out of a synthetic geometry without measurement?","['analytic-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'logic', 'geometry']"
2342398,Finding the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$,"EDIT: turns out $\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$ was actually right. In that case, that gives me a follow-up question of sorts. So the larger context of the original question was to find the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. Following the definition of the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$ in my textbook (all $x$ in the domain of $g(x)$ such that $g(x)$ falls into the domain of $f(x)$), I first found the domain and range of $f(x)=\sqrt{x-3}$, which was $[3,+\infty)$ and $[0,+\infty)$ respectively. I next found the domain and range of $g(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}+3}$, which was $\mathbb{R}$ and $[\sqrt{3},\infty)$ respectively. From there, I reasoned that since the range of $f(x)$ falls within the domain of 
$g(x)$, the domain of $f(x)$, $[3,+\infty)$ must also be the domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. A graph of $\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$ indicates otherwise. Thus, my (real, presumably) question is why $[3,+\infty)$ was the incorrect domain of $(f \circ g)(x)$. ORIGINAL QUESTION I was asked to evaluate $(f \circ g)(x)$ given the following functions:
$$f(x)=\sqrt{x-3}$$
$$g(x)=\sqrt{x^{2}+3}$$
My first answer was that $(f \circ g)(x)=\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$, which would make sense considering $(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$. However, this is apparently not correct (graphing $f(g(x))$ as $Y_{1}(Y_{2}(X))$ in my calculator didn't match graphing $\sqrt{\sqrt{x^{2}+3}-3}$).

2342483,Alternative proof for Riemann integration Theorem,"I already have a proof of the following theorem and I was wondering if there is another kind of proof, (just being curious). Suppose $f$ is Riemann integrable and $h$ is non-decreasing and
non-negative. Let $F(x) = \int_x^b f$. If $A \leqslant F(x) \leqslant
B$ for all $x \in [a,b],$ then $h(b)A \leqslant \int_a^b f h \leqslant
 h(b)B$. Proof: Taking any partition $P = (x_0,x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ consider the Riemann sums $$S_P = \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k) h(x_k)(x_k -x_{k-1}), \\ S_{P,j} = \sum_{k = j}^n f(x_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}),$$ which converge to $\int_a^b fh $ and $\int_{x_{j-1}}^b f$. Since $f(x_k)(x_k - x_{k-1}) = S_{P,k} - S_{P,k-1}$ we have $$S_P = \sum_{k=1}^n h(x_k)(S_{P,k} - S_{P,k-1}) \\ = h(x_1)S_{P,1} + (h(x_2) - h(x_1))S_{P,2} + \ldots (h(x_n) - h(x_{n-1}))S_{P,n} $$ Let $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$ be the upper and lower bounds for the finite set $\{S_{P,k}\}$. Since $h$ is non-decreasing $h(x_k) - h(x_{k-1}) \geqslant 0$ and $$\hat{A} h(b) = \hat{A} h(x_n) \leqslant S_P \leqslant \hat{B} h(x_n) = \hat{B} h(b).$$ As the number of partition points increases the sum $S_P$ converges to $\int_a^b fh $ and it can be shown that $\hat{A} \to A$ and $\hat{B} \to B.$ Therefore, $$h(b)A \leqslant \int_a^b f h \leqslant h(b)B$$ Note: This proof was made by RRL user :)","['real-analysis', 'alternative-proof', 'riemann-integration', 'integration', 'analysis']"

My answer was yes, and this is my ""proof"". Since the limit of $f'(x)$ exists, we can conclude that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f'(x)=0$. Suppose that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}>0$. Hence, there are $c,k\in\mathbb{R}^+$ such that for every $x>k$, we have $\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}>c$, or $f'(x)>cf(x)$. By letting $x\rightarrow\infty$, we shall get $0>0$, which is a contradiction.
