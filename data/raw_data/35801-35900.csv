343894,If $(\pm x)^2 = X$ then $\sqrt{X} = x$?,"I've been helping my siblings with their GCSE and A Level maths and I've come across a question where they have just taken the positive square root. It's a pure maths question and there's no (obvious) reason to ignore the negative square root. I always thought that the square root always gave two values, a positive and negative, and this is shown in the quadratic formula where we have $\pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$. So what is the correct answer? Should you always take just the positive or the negative aswell? In the same way, if we have $\cos(\theta) = x$, why do we not say then $\theta = \pm \cos^{-1}(x)$ as $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$ isn't it? EDIT: One question wants me to work out the normal of the curve $y^2 = 4ax$ where $a$ is a positive constant at the point $(at^2, 2at)$. They start by taking the square root and write $y = \sqrt{4ax}$. In another question, they want me to work out the tangent to the line $y^2 = 27x$ at the point $(3,9)$. Here, they also start by taking the square root but write $y = \pm \sqrt{27x}$. Why have they taken the positive in one and both in the other? It'd probably be easier to do it using implicit differentiation, but I just want to understand why the square root bit is different.",['algebra-precalculus']
343905,Making both bounds of integration zero,"I came across a question while evaluating the integral: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{\cos{t}}{1+9\sin^2{t}}\, dt $$ If you substitute $u=3\sin{t}$, you get: $$ \int_{0}^{0}\frac{1}{3+3u^2}\, du $$ Which evaluates to zero because(?) the bounds are both zero. But then, can't you substitute any arbitrary expression to change both bounds to zero -- making the value zero? So in evaluating: $$\int_{0}^{1}x\,dx$$ We could substitute $u = x^2-x$ or some trigonometric expression to change both bounds to zero. Clearly there is a misstep here, but which part of this substitution is invalid?","['calculus', 'integration']"

, it doesn't have well-defined moments . 
Therefore both the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem can't apply to the distribution.
For example,
Given iid sample points $X_1, \dots, X_n$ of the distribution, as $n\to \infty$, $\bar{X}$ will not converge to a constant in probability . However a note says under the above Cauchy distribution, ""asymptotic variance of $\sqrt{n} \bar{X}$ is $\infty$"", which seems like a version of CLT? The definition of the asymptotic variance of a statistic is defined in Casella's Statistical Infernce: Definition 10.1.9 For an estimator $T_n$, suppose that $k_n(T_n - \tau(\theta)) \to n(0, \sigma^2)$ in distribution. The parameter $\sigma^2$ is called the asymptotic variance or variance of the limit distribution of $T_n$. So I wonder if the above definition applies to the case here, for example, with $\tau(\theta) =0$ and $k_n = \sqrt{n}$? If yes, the limit distribution of $\sqrt{n} \bar{X}$  is $N(0, \infty)$, the asymptotic mean of $\sqrt{n} \bar{X}$  is $0$ and its asymptotic variance is $\infty$? If no, how shall we understand ""the asymptotic variance of $\sqrt{n} \bar{X}$ is $\infty$""? Btw, for each $n$, $\sqrt{n} \bar{X}$ doesn't admit mean and variance, right?

344019,generating set of predictable sigma algebra,"I am solving an exercise in Rogers and Williams and want to ask if my solution is correct. Let me first introduce the notation. The space $b\mathcal{E}$ is the space of processes of the form
$$H(t,\omega)=\sum_{i=1}^nZ_i(\omega)(S_i(\omega),T_i(\omega)]$$
where $(S_i(\omega),T_i(\omega)]$ is the characteristic function of the set $\{t:S_i(\omega)<t\le T_i(\omega)\}$. We assume $S_1\le T_1\le S_2\le \dots$  are stopping times and $Z_i\in b\mathcal{F}_{S_i}$ (bounded r.v. measurable w.r.t $\mathcal{F}_{S_i}$. The predictable sigma algebra $\mathcal{P}$ on $(0,\infty)\times\Omega$ is generated by all LCRL adapted processes. I know that $\sigma(b\mathcal{E})=\mathcal{P}$. I want to prove that the sets of the form
$$(u_\Gamma,\infty)=\{(t,\omega):t>u,\omega\in\Gamma\}$$
with $u\ge 0$ and $\Gamma\in \mathcal{F}_u$ also generate the predictable sigma algebra. Let's denote with $\mathcal{C}$ the set of all these sets. What I did: A characteristic function of a set above is of the form $\mathbf1_{(u,\infty)}\mathbf1_{\Gamma}$, which is clearly LCRL and adapted. Therefore $\sigma(\mathcal{C})\subset \mathcal{P}$. For the reverse inequality I am not sure. A hint says that $\mathcal{P}$ is also generated from processes of the form $Z(s,\infty)$, where $Z$ is $\mathcal{F}_s$ measurable. Why is this true? Clearly the generated sigma algebra of this processes is contained in $\mathcal{P}$. But why is the reverse inequality true? Assuming this hint, I would prove the original statement like this: First let $Z=\mathbf1_\Gamma$, where $\Gamma\in\mathcal{F}_s$. Then $Z(s,\infty)$ is $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ measurable. By measure theoretic induction, we can find a sequence of linear combinations of functions of the form $\mathbf1_\Gamma(s,\infty)$ which converges to every $H=Z(s,\infty)$ with $Z\in b\mathcal{F}_s$. This proves the reverse inequality, assuming the claim. Is my proof correct? And if so, why is the hint true? Moreover, they claim as Corollary of the exercise: $\mathcal{P}=\{(T,\infty):T \mbox{ stopping time }\}$. I guess this should mean that the RHS is also a generating set for $\mathcal{P}$. But again, why is this true?

344032,How to find a local maximum and local minimum of a function?,"My question is related to how to find a local maximum and local minimum. As far I know, for the first we should find  derivative of the function and set it  to zero. For exmaple, suppose our function is given by: $$f(x)=x^3+4x^2+5x+6$$ We first differentiate it: $$f'(x)=3x^2+8x+5$$ For optimal points of $3x^2+8x+5=0$ we find $x_1=-1$  and  $x_2=-5/3$. For local maximum and/or local minimum, we should choose neighbor points of critical  points, for $x_1=-1$, we choose  two points, $-2$  and $-0$, and after we insert into first equation: $$f(-2)=4$$ $$f(-1)=-8+16-10+6=4$$ $$f(0)=6$$ So, it means that  points  $x_1=-1$ is local minimum for this case, right? 
Because it has minimum  output among  $-2$ and  $-0$, right? For this  case, $f(-2)=f(-1)$, but does it change something? Just consider for first point, so if  $f(-1)<f(-2)$, then it means that it would be local minim as well, but if $f(-2)>(-1)$, then it  would be saddle point.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"

I have proven that the axiom of choice implies the statement , but I am having difficulty with the other implication. The hint given in the book is to use the previous exercise, which says that the axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that if $I$ is a set, $\forall\alpha\in I$ $X_\alpha$ is a non-empty-set and $\forall \alpha,\beta\in I, \alpha\neq \beta\implies X_\alpha\cap X_\beta=\emptyset$, then there exists a set $Y$ with $\forall \alpha\in I ,|Y\cap X_\alpha|=1$.

I think then we should find a set $Y$ with $\forall \alpha \in I,|Y\cap(\{\alpha\}\times X_\alpha)|=1$, perhaps by using that there is some surjection between two sets and so by assumption some injection which goes the other way, whose image is suitable as a set $Y$.

\lim_{n\to \infty} \mbox{(perimeter of the inscribed $2^n$-gon)} &= \lim_{n\to \infty} \mbox{(perimeter of the circumscribed $2^n$-gon)} \\ &:= 2\pi
\end{align}
$$ Yet now (at least according to my professor) we are not allowed to conclude that the perimeter of the unit circle itself equals $2\pi$, because we have only showed it for $2^n$-gons and maybe some other approximations would give us different result. Now what if we are interested in the areas? $$
\begin{align} 
\lim_{n\to \infty} \mbox{(area of the circumscribed $2^n$-gon)} &=
\lim_{n\to \infty} \mbox{($2^n \times $ area of the triangle)}  
 \\ &=  \lim_{n\to \infty} (2^n \frac{1 \times s_n}{2})

Both minimizations are under a constraint that $\sum_{i,j}d^2_{i,j}(X)$ or $\sum_{i,j}||f(Y_{i.})-f(Y_{j.})||_\mathcal{H}$ is constrained to a fixed real positive value $\nu$. Here, $d_{ij}^2(X)$ is the squared Euclidean distance between the rows $i,j$ of the real unknown matrix $X$. $Y$ is a fixed real matrix. Question:
Why would the latter problem under the function space be better!? What does the RKHS norm provide, which is different than the euclidean distance/norm? From this description, why do you think my academic friend has said this-when thought from different mathematical directions? What are we gaining or losing between these two formulations?

344370,Question about set theory class notation,"In set theory (say, ZF) the 'class notation' is introduced. In general one could say that a class is something of the form $\{ x \, | \, \varphi ( x ) \}$ where $\varphi ( x)$ is some formula in the language of set theory, having only $x$ as free variable. I know that these (i.e. classes) are just a matter of handy notation, and that in principle they can always 'deleted', so they're not really part of the language. Now I've heard that the big difference between sets on the one hand, and classes on the other hand, is that sets can be element of other sets while classes cannot be element of a set (and also, classes cannot be element of another class). I thought I understood this, however I have the following concern. I will give a concrete example below. Let $A=\{ x \, | \, \varphi ( x ) \}$ be a class, and let $B$ be the class $\{ x \, | \, \emptyset \in x, \mbox{ and if } y \in x \mbox{ then } \{ y \} \in x \}$. Now, the expression ""$A \in B$"" does make sense, in this particular case, I think. Namely it would be simply an abbreviation of the sentence $\emptyset \in A \wedge \forall y \, ( y \in A \rightarrow \{ y \} \in A )$. And this means that $\varphi ( \emptyset ) \wedge \forall y \, ( \varphi ( y ) \rightarrow \varphi ( \{ y \} ) )$. (Note that in this example the 'a priori' class $B$ in fact happens to be a set itself, assuming some axioms.) So my point is: it seems to be the case that in some cases it would make sense. (Of course, the reason why it makes sense in this particular example is because in the sentence ""$\emptyset \in x, \mbox{ and if } y \in x \mbox{ then } \{ y \} \in x$"" defining the class $B$, there are only terms of the form $\ldots \in x$, and not the other way around; if for example there would have appeared $x \in \emptyset$ we would finally get $A \in \emptyset$ which doesn't make any sense.) Thus, I think that in general it does not make sense to write things like ""$A \in B$"" where $A$ and $B$ are classes. But I'm a bit in doubt about all of this, as it seems pretty confusing. Hence, Questions: 1) What I have described above, does that make sense? Is my 'analysis' correct? Or is what I've said essentially false. 2) In cases when $A \in B$ (with $A,B$ classes) does make sense, can we just write it like this? Or maybe write it along with a comment that in this particular case it makes sense, as it is just an abbreviation of this and that formula?",['elementary-set-theory']
344393,Prove that if $A \mathop \triangle B \subseteq A$ then $B\subseteq A$,"I'm having trouble with the logic in this proof and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction (if I'm wrong)? Prove that if $A\mathop\triangle B\subseteq A$ then $B\subseteq A$. (Here $\triangle$ refers to the symmetric difference). I started by using the definition of symmetric difference that $A\mathop\triangle B = (A\setminus B)\mathop\cup \mathop(B\setminus A)$. So $A\mathop\triangle B\subseteq A$ = $\forall\psi[(\psi\in A \wedge \psi \notin B) \vee (\psi \in B \wedge \psi \notin A) \rightarrow \psi \in A$]. Here is what I have for my proof: Suppose $x \in B$. Suppose $x \notin A.$ Then since $x \in B$ and $A\mathop\triangle B\subseteq A$, it follows that $x \in A$. But this contradicts the fact that $x \notin A$, so we can conclude that $x \in A$. Since $x$ was an arbitrary element of $B$, it follows that $B\subseteq A$. What I'm wondering is, is it enough to use universal instantiation on $x$ from the statement $\forall\psi[(\psi\in A \wedge \psi \notin B) \vee (\psi \in B \wedge \psi \notin A) \rightarrow \psi \in A$] given that $x \in B$ and $ x \notin A$ to get my contradiction?

344427,Solutions to $\binom{n}{5} = 2 \binom{m}{5}$,"In Finite Mathematics by Lial et al. (10th ed.), problem 8.3.34 says: On National Public Radio, the Weekend Edition program posed the
  following probability problem: Given a certain number of balls, of
  which some are blue, pick 5 at random.  The probability that all 5 are
  blue is 1/2.  Determine the original number of balls and decide how
  many were blue. If there are $n$ balls, of which $m$ are blue, then the probability that 5 randomly chosen balls are all blue is $\binom{m}{5} / \binom{n}{5}$.  We want this to be $1/2$,
so $\binom{n}{5} = 2\binom{m}{5}$; equivalently,
$n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4) = 2 m(m-1)(m-2)(m-3)(m-4)$.
I'll denote these quantities as $[n]_5$ and $2 [m]_5$ (this is a notation for the so-called ""falling factorial."") A little fooling around will show that $[m+1]_5 = \frac{m+1}{m-4}[m]_5$.
Solving $\frac{m+1}{m-4} = 2$ shows that the only solution with $n = m + 1$ has $m = 9$, $n = 10$. Is this the only solution? You can check that $n = m + 2$ doesn't yield any integer solutions, by using the quadratic formula to solve $(m + 2)(m  +1) = 2(m - 3)(m - 4)$.  I have ruled out $n = m + 3$ or $n = m + 4$ with similar checks.  For $n \geq m + 5$, solutions would satisfy a quintic equation, which of course has no general formula to find solutions. Note that, as $n$ gets bigger, the ratio of successive values of $\binom{n}{5}$ gets smaller; $\binom{n+1}{5} = \frac{n+1}{n-4}\binom{n}{5}$
and $\frac{n+1}{n-4}$ is less than 2—in fact, it approaches 1. So it seems possible that, for some $k$, $\binom{n+k}{5}$ could be $2 \binom{n}{5}$. This is now a question at MathOverflow .","['binomial-coefficients', 'diophantine-equations', 'probability', 'combinatorics']"

This problem can be somewhar reduced via $\sin \theta = \frac{e^{i \theta} - e^{-i \theta}}{2i}$. For the case of $n$ prime this turns the problem into the classical evaluation of a Quadratic Gauss Sum, so for $n$ prime the problem is trivial.

Find the radii of convergence of the power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^{2n}$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^{n^2}$.

Shouldn't the $\mathrm{log}\Delta t$ terms go to $-\infty$? Edit I think I understand now where my confusion was coming from. If we look at the probability, instead of log probability, then as $\Delta t$ becomes small the probability approaches: $ \Delta t^n \prod_{i=1}^n \lambda(t_i) \mathrm{exp}\left(-\int_0^T\lambda(t)dt\right)$ The probability of an event happening in the interval: $[t_1 - \Delta t/2, t_1 + \Delta t/2] \times [t_2 - \Delta t/2, t_2 + \Delta t/2] \times \ldots \times [t_n - \Delta t/2, t_n + \Delta t/2]$ should scale as $\Delta t^n$ for small $\Delta t$, so while the probability of events happening at exactly those times goes to zero (as it must), the density does not.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability']"

344719,On the smooth structure of $\mathbb{R}P^n$ in Milnor's book on characteristic classes.,"This question concerns problem 1-B in the book of Milnor and Stasheff part a.

The problem is to show that $F$  is a smoothness structure on $\mathbb{R}P^n$. It is my understanding that to do this I must do the following: First I should show that the set of functions in $F$ separates points on $\mathbb{R}P^n$, then show that $i(\mathbb{R}P^n)\subset\mathbb{R}^{F}$ is a smooth manifold where $i_{f}(x)=f(x)$ for $f\in F$. Finally I should show that $F$ is the set of all smooth real valued functions on $\mathbb{R}P^n$. 1) What are some candidates for functions in $F$ that separate points? My first guess was maybe I should play with trignometric functions but then I think smoothness becomes an issue. Perhaps the $f_{ij}$ functions defined in part b work? 2) I dont know how to get my hands on $i(\mathbb{R}P^n)$ because $F$ could be infinite. What charts can you use?

Question: Are the product variables $z_1$ and $z_2$ dependent? What is the PDF of $S=z_1 + z_2$? My take: since $S$ is a function of $a_1, a_2, x_1, x_2$ and $x_1, x_2$ are dependent, the joint PDF $f_{z_1, z_2}(\zeta_1, \zeta_2) = f_{a_1, a_2, x_1, x_2} (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \xi_1, \xi_2)$ is not in general the product of the marginals, so $z_1$ and $z_2$ are dependent.","['probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'random-variables']"
