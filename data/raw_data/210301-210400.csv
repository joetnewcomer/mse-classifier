4226667,"Is an $\mathrm{ARMA}(1,1)$ process with an $\mathrm{ARCH}(1)$ innovation strictly stationary?","During some self studies of time series and ARCH processes, I thought of the following example. Given an $\mathrm{ARCH}(1)$ process $Z_t$ , \begin{align*}
Z_t &= e_t\sqrt{h_t}\\
h_t&=\alpha_0+\alpha_1Z_{t-1}^2 
\end{align*} where $e_t$ is a sequence of IID standard Gaussian rvs and $\alpha_0\geq0$ and $\alpha_1\in[0,1)$ . By Brockwell and Davis (2016) $Z_t$ is strictly stationary. Next, suppose we let $X_t$ be a causal $\mathrm{ARMA}(1,1)$ process $\phi(B)X_t=\theta(B)Z_t$ . Then clearly $X_t$ is weakly stationary. However, is it also strictly stationary? Spontaneously, I'd think that strict stationarity of $X_t$ would follow by strict stationarity of $Z_t$ but have no clue of how one would prove that. My searches online on the topic have not yielded much of an answer.","['time-series', 'statistics', 'stationary-processes', 'probability-theory']"
4226721,"Inequality for a decreasing, concave function on [0,1]","Suppose I have a function $f:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ that is decreasing and concave. Let $a,b,c,d\in(0,1)$ , with $a>b$ and $a+b>1$ . I am trying to prove the following inequality: $$ 
f\Bigg(\frac{(1-a)\cdot c}{(1-a)\cdot c + b\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( (1-a)\cdot c + b\cdot d \big)
+ 
f\Bigg(\frac{a\cdot c}{a\cdot c + (1-b)\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( a\cdot c + (1-b)\cdot d \big) \leq \\
f\Bigg(\frac{(1-b)\cdot c}{(1-b)\cdot c + a\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( (1-b)\cdot c + a\cdot d \big)
+ 
f\Bigg(\frac{b\cdot c}{b\cdot c + (1-a)\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( b\cdot c + (1-a)\cdot d \big) 
$$ My approach was the following. Since $f$ is also subadditive (it's concave and $f(0)\geq0$ ), you can show that $$
f\Bigg(\frac{(1-a)\cdot c}{(1-a)\cdot c + b\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( (1-a)\cdot c + b\cdot d \big) \leq f\big( (1-a)\cdot c \big), 
$$ and $$
f\Bigg(\frac{a\cdot c}{a\cdot c + (1-b)\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( a\cdot c + (1-b)\cdot d \big) \leq f\big(a\cdot c \big),
$$ after which I got stuck.. Does anyone know how to proceed, or perhaps know a better way to approach this? EDIT: Similarly, (using the subadditivity), you can also show that $$
f\Bigg(\frac{(1-b)\cdot c}{(1-b)\cdot c + a\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( (1-b)\cdot c + a\cdot d \big)\geq f(1) \cdot (1-b)\cdot c,
$$ and $$
f\Bigg(\frac{b\cdot c}{b\cdot c + (1-a)\cdot d }\Bigg)\cdot \big( b\cdot c + (1-a)\cdot d \big) \geq f(1) \cdot b\cdot c.
$$ If you combine these inequalities you will get the sufficient condition: $$f\big( (1-a)\cdot c \big) + f\big(a\cdot c \big) \leq f(1)\cdot c,$$ which is not satisfied because of the decreasing property of $f$ . So this condition is too ""loose"", probably because the inequalities are too loose..","['inequality', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"
4226725,"Differential equation: mixing salt into water problem where there is also leakage. Is my differential equation correct, and how to solve?","Initially, a tank contains $50$ litres of water and the tank water contains no
salt. Salt is added to the water at time $t=0,$ at a constant rate
of $5$ grams per minute. The salt does not change the volume of the
water in the tank. The water in the tank is stirred constantly, so
that the concentration of salt throughout the tank is uniform. Furthermore,
the saltwater solution leaks out the tank a constant rate of $100$ ml per minute. What is
the concentration of salt in the tank after $4$ hours? My attempt: Let $t$ be time in minutes, let $V(t)$ be the volume of water at time $t$ , and let $m(t)$ be the mass of salt dissolved in the water in the tank at time $t$ . Then, changing units of volume from litres into metres cubed, $V(t) = (0.05 - 0.0001t) m^3.$ Now, in order to find the rate of mass of salt leaving the tank with respect to time, we first should find the concentration of salt in the tank water. Concentration of salt in tank water = $\left(\frac{m(t)}{V(t)}\right)\ = \left(\frac{m(t)}{0.05 - 0.0001t}\right)\ g/m^3.\ $ Hence we need only need to find $\ m(240)\ $ and then the answer to the question is just $\left(\frac{m(240)}{0.05 - 0.0001\times 240}\right)\ g/m^3. $ Now I believe that the rate at which the mass of the salt leaks out the tank with respect to time is (concentration of salt in tank water in $g/m^3$ ) $\times$ (the rate at which water leaks out the tank in $m^3$ /second), although I am not certain of this. On the basis that this is all correct so far, the mass of salt in the water in the tank should satisfy the differential equation: $$\frac{dm}{dt} = 5 - 0.0001 \times \left(\frac{m(t)}{0.05 - 0.0001t}\right),$$ or to tidy up the final term, $$\frac{dm}{dt} = 5 - \frac{m(t)}{500 - t}.$$ I am not sure how to solve such an equation. Wolfram Alpha says that the general solution is: $$m(t) = c(t-500) + 5(t-500)\log(t-500).$$ However, this doesn't allow for the initial condition $m(0) = 0$ to be satisfied, so something has gone wrong here. Perhaps $\log(t-500)$ should be $\log\lvert t-500 \rvert$ ? Or Is it the differential equation itself wrong? I suspect so, in which case, can someone give me a hint as to how to figure out what the differential equation should be ? I am looking for pointers in the right direction, rather than a complete solution to the problem.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'initial-value-problems', 'calculus', 'related-rates', 'problem-solving']"
4226726,6-dimensional integral with strange result,"I am working through a physics paper where I encounter the following 6-dimensional integral: $$ G(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{2}{(2\pi)^6 n^2} \int_{k \leq q_F} \int_{k' \leq q_F} \frac{\mathbf{q} \cdot (\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{k} -\mathbf{k}')}{|\mathbf{q} + \mathbf{k} -\mathbf{k}'|^2} \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{k} \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{k}'.$$ Here $\mathbf{q},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}'$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $q,k,k'$ are their euclidean norms. The authors present a solution to this intergal which is claimed to be exact, but sadly without any ansatz or idea to solve it. It reads: \begin{align} 
G(\mathbf{q}) = \frac{9}{32} \left( \frac{q}{q_F} \right)^2 \left\lbrace \frac{2}{105} \left[ 24 \left( \frac{q_F}{q} \right)^2 + 44 + \left( \frac{q}{q_F} \right)^2 \right] \\

\end{align} I find this result rather strange because of all the numerical fractions and I have never seen any result similar to this, which is why I don´t have any idea how to arrive at this result. So far the only idea I had was to substitute with a relative coordinate $\mathbf{t} = \mathbf{k} -\mathbf{k}'$ , but I have trouble finding out the new integral boundaries. Further I would take $\mathbf{q}$ parallel to the $z$ -axis, such that I can use $\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{k} = qk \cos\theta$ and use spherical coordinates. Also the definitions $n = \frac{q_F^3}{3\pi^2}$ and $\int_{k \leq q_F} \mathrm{d}^3 \mathbf{k} = \frac{4\pi}{3}q_F^3$ could be helpful. Maybe someone has done something similar before and knows how to approach an integral like this.

4226763,Letter permutations in 'COOLEEMEE',"I'm considering the word 'COOLEEMEE'. The first part is asking the number of distinguishable permutations of these 9 letters, which should be $9!/(2!4!)=7560$ . The next part is asking how many distinguishable permutations of these 9 letters are there if consecutive O’s are forbidden? (And the last part if how many distinguishable permutations if consecutive E’s are forbidden) If we don't allow consecutive O's, then I think we could first permute the rest letters 'CLEEMEE', so there're $7!/4!$ ways. Then there're 8 spaces and I want to insert 2 O's, so should that be $\frac{7!}{4!}\binom{8}2$ in total? Then similarly if consecutive E’s are forbidden, there're $\frac{5!}{2!}\binom{6}4$ total ways. Is my reasoning correct? I feel like I missed some cases but I'm not sure.

4226767,Finite subgroups of the multiplicative group of a skew field,"It is well known that any finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic, but this certainly fails for skew fields (look in the quaternions for an easy example). Yet there are constraints on what finite subgroups of multiplicative groups of a skew fields can be: for example, every all their abelian subgroups must be cyclic (this follows readily from the above result). Is there a nice characterization of such subgroups, or at least some interesting constraints on them? I'd be surprised if any finite group with all its abelian subgroups cyclic occurred as such a group, though I don't have a counterexample. I'm also curious about the simplest example of such a group which doesn't come from the quaternions, and results that extend for infinite subgroups.","['field-theory', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups']"
4226768,Consider two i.i.d random variables $X$ and $Y$ with same PDF $f(x) = e^{-x}$,"Question: Given two iid random variables $X$ and $Y$ with same PDF of $f(x) = e^{-x}$ , $x>0$ , find the PDF of $X+Y$ and $3X+2Y$ . Are these two new PDF's independent? What I've got so far: First I defined $Z = X + Y$ , since $x,y>0$ , $z>0$ . By applying a convolution on $X$ and $Y$ we get: $f_Z(z) = \int_{0}^{z} f_{XY}(x,z-x) \,dx \rightarrow f_Z(z) = \int_{0}^{z} e^{-x + x - z} \,dx \rightarrow f_Z(z) = ze^{-z}$ . Now for $W = 3X+2Y$ , by also applying a convolution, we get: $f_W(w) = \int_{0}^{w/3} f_{XY}(x,\dfrac{w-3x}{2}) \,dx \rightarrow f_W(w) = \int_{0}^{w/3} e^{(x-w)/2} \,dx \rightarrow f_W(w) = 2(e^{-w/3} - e^{-w/2})$ . However, when calculating the joint distribution of $Z$ and $W$ using the jacobian method, we get: $|J| = 1$ , $Y = 3Z-W$ and $X = W-2Z$ , and thus: $f_{WZ}(w,z) = f_{XY}(w-2z,3z-w) \rightarrow f_{WZ}(w,z) = e^{-(w-2z+3z-w)} \rightarrow f_{WZ}(w,z) = e^{-z} $ And so I concluded that the two new PDF's are not independent, because their joint probability is not equal to the product of the marginal probabilities. Are these results correct? Also, how can I get to $f_Z(z)$ from $f_{WZ}(w,z)$ ? Because I can't seem to figure out the right integration bounds in order to get the right marginal probabilities.","['probability-distributions', 'convolution', 'calculus', 'probability', 'random-variables']"
4226775,How to plot cosine with trigonometric identity,"There is the well-known trigonometric identity: $\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x) = 1$ . Without giving a second thought I took use of it to convert from cosine to sine. Especially in physics involving reflections: $\frac{n_2}{n_1}\,\cos(\alpha_2) = \frac{n_2}{n_1}\,\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\alpha_2)}$ . This helped many times. Just now I realized that plotting both sides of the equation actually lead to two different graphs. Even plotting $\pm\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\alpha_2)}$ does not equal the simple cosine. It seems like there has to be a piecewise function defined giving the positive square for positive $\alpha_2$ and vice versa.

As a bonus, attempting this with a $70\times70$ Klein bottle or projective plane would be interesting, too. edit: The torus case was resolved in the negative in this question, which leaves just the Klein bottle and projective plane identifications left.

4226846,"Relation between an ""algebra"" in Analysis and in Algebra","While studying some measure theory, I came across the following two definitions, given a set $\mathbb{X}$ : A ring is a non-empty subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})$ such that it is closed for unions and set-differences An algebra is a non-empty subset of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})$ such that it is a ring and contains $\mathbb{X}$ ; equivalently, it is closed for unions and complements This immediately got me thinking about the algebraic implications. Given a former question of mine on this site, I saw that the first definition actually said such a set was a subring of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{X})$ , with the operations $A \Delta B = (A\setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)$ and $A\cup B$ .

4226899,Visualizing Spectrums of basic localizations of rings,"I'm trying to understand how to visualize schemes and so I'm starting with visualizing $\operatorname{Spec}$ of different rings.  I've marked my questions with question numbers as I go: I understand that $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x)$ is the set of prime ideals in $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ containing $(x)$ which is just $(x)$ and maximal ideals $(x,y-a)$ , so this is the affine line (corresponding to the obvious fact that $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(x) \cong \mathbb{C}[y]$ ) What about the localizations $\mathbb{C}[x,y]_x$ and $\mathbb{C}[x,y]_{(x)}$ ? I understand that these correspond to prime ideals of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ not containing $x$ and contained in $x$ respectively. For the former, $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{C}[x,y]_x$ is the picture of the entire affine plane that's 'away' from the y axis. That is every prime ideal that doesn't 'pass through' the y axis, which is every prime ideal not equal to $(x)$ or $(x, y-a)$ . (Maybe 'pass through' isn't the best phrase here, since the parabola $(y-x^2)$ is perfectly fine, even though it intersects the y-axis?) It seems like it's just the compliment of the quotient example at the start. Is there some algebraic way of saying this geometric intuition aside from just noting the ideals contain and resp. don't contain x? Or is that the main point? The second thing I'm confused about is the second localization $\mathbb{C}[x,y]_{(x)}$ . What geometric picture does the spectrum of this correspond to? Intuitively, it seems like the spectrum contains the prime ideals of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ contained in $(x)$ which is just $(0)$ and $(x)$ . But what's the picture for that? Is it just the y-axis? If so, how is that different from the first example? I don't quite see the translations between algebra and geometry here.

If the force has the form $F=F(x_i,t)=f(x_i)g(t)$ , determine if the equation of motion is integrable. The standard answer I am finding copied and pasted is: $$
m\ddot{x}_i=f(x_i)g(t)\\

m\frac{d\dot{x}}{f(x_i)}=g(t)dt

m\ddot{x}_i=f(x_i)g(t)\\
m\dot{x}\frac{d\dot{x}_i}{dx_i}=f(x_i)g(t)\\

\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2=g(t)\int f(x_i)dx_i\\
\text{which can be modified to give }\\ \sqrt{\frac{m}{2}}\dot{x}=\sqrt{g(t)}\sqrt{\int f(x_i)dx_i}\\

4227091,showing that $G$ does not have an embedding in $GL_n(F)$ for any $n\ge 1$ and field $F$,"Let $G$ denote the group of bijective maps $g : \mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ such that $g$ fixes all but finitely many integers. Show that there does not exist a field $F$ and an $n\ge 1$ so that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of (embeds in) $GL_n(F),$ the set of invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $F$ . I know that for any field $F$ , every finite group embeds into $GL_n(F)$ for some $n\ge 1.$ I think it might be useful to use a contradiction here. So suppose there exists an $n\ge 1$ and a field $F$ so that $\phi : G\to S$ is an isomorphism, where $S$ is a subgroup of $GL_n(F),$ denoted $S\leq GL_n(F).$ There are various properties of isomorphisms that may be useful; for instance, the order of $g\in G$ equals the order of $\phi(g)$ in $S$ , $S$ is abelian if and only if $G$ is abelian, etc.  I'm not sure how to use the properties of $G$ and $\phi$ to obtain a contradiction here though. Edit: I was wondering if @JyrkiLahtonen could elaborate on his answer? I think I mostly understand it, but I don't get a few details. Below is my understanding of his answer. $G_2$ is abelian because the permutations $\sigma_i$ and $\sigma_j$ commute for any $i$ and $j$ and any element of $G_2$ is of the form $\sigma_{i_1}^{a_{i_1}}\cdots \sigma_{i_n}^{a_{i_n}}$ for some $i_j \ge 1, a_{i_j} \in \mathbb{Z}\,\forall i_j$ (so $\sigma_{a}^{b}\sigma_{c}^{d} = \sigma_{c}^{d}\sigma_{a}^{b}$ for any $b,d \in\mathbb{Z}, a,c\ge 1$ ). It is an infinite direct sum of cyclic groups of order two because for any $i$ the cyclic group $\langle \sigma_i \rangle = \{e, \sigma_i\}$ has trivial intersection with the subgroup $\langle \{ \langle \sigma_j\rangle : j\neq i\}\rangle$ , $G_2$ is abelian so every subgroup $\langle \sigma_i\rangle$ of $G_2$ is normal in $G_2$ , and $G_2 = \langle \{ \langle \sigma_j\rangle : j\ge 1\} \rangle = \langle e,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\cdots \rangle = \langle \sigma_1,\sigma_2,\cdots \rangle.$ The vectors $\frac{1}2(x+\phi(\sigma_i)(x))$ and $\frac{1}2(x-\phi(\sigma_i)(x))$ are eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ with corresponding eigenvalues +1 and $-1$ . Since $x$ was arbitrary, this shows that every vector of $V$ is a linear combination of eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i),$ so the set of eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ spans $V$ . Hence we can obtain a basis of eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ for $V$ (e.g. we start with an eigenvector $v_1$ and then if $V\neq \mathrm{span} \{v_1\}$ , we pick an eigenvector $v_2 \in V\neq \mathrm{span} \{v_1\}$ and continue until we get a basis). Since $V$ has an ordered basis consisting of eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ , the matrix $\phi(\sigma_i)$ is diagonalizable. $N$ is the number of matrices. The above shows that the space $V$ has a basis consisting of eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_i)$ for fixed $i$ . Every element of $V$ can be written as a linear combination of two eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ corresponding to the eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$ . Also, these eigenspaces are disjoint because if $0\neq w\in V_+\cap V_-,$ then $w$ is an eigenvector of $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ with eigenvalue $1$ and $-1$ , which isn't possible. So $V= V_+\oplus V_-.$ The transformations $\phi(\sigma_j), 1\leq j\leq k$ commute with $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ because $\phi(\sigma_j)\phi(\sigma_{k+1}) = \phi(\sigma_j \sigma_{k+1}) = \phi(\sigma_{k+1}\sigma_j) = \phi(\sigma_{k+1})\phi(\sigma_j).$ Fix $1\leq j\leq k.$ Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be the eigenvectors of $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ corresponding to eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$ . Then $\phi(\sigma_j)(v_1) = \phi(\sigma_j)(\phi(\sigma_{k+1})(v_1)) = \phi(\sigma_{k+1})(\phi(\sigma_j)(v_1)),$ so $\phi(\sigma_j)(v_1)$ is an eigenvector of $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ with eigenvalue $1.$ Hence $\phi(\sigma_j)(V_+) \subseteq V_+.$ Similarly $\phi(\sigma_j)^{-1}(V_+)\subseteq V_+$ so $V_+ = \phi(\sigma_j) (V_+).$ Similarly $\phi(\sigma_j)(V_-) = V_-.$ So does the induction hypothesis apply for $N=k$ ? An eigenvector $v$ is a shared eigenvector of all $\phi(\sigma_i)$ if it's an eigenvector of every $\phi(\sigma_i),$ right? What does ""they must all respect the decomposition (*)"" mean precisely? Hence if $v$ is a shared eigenvector of all $\phi(\sigma_j)$ 's in the basis for $V_-,$ for any $1\leq j\leq k, \phi(\sigma_{k+1})(v) = \phi(\sigma_{k+1})(-\phi(\sigma_j)(v)) = -\phi(\sigma_j)(\phi(\sigma_{k+1})(v))$ , so $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})(v)$ is an eigenvector of $\phi(\sigma_j)$ with eigenvalue -1. But is $v$ an eigenvector of $\phi(\sigma_{k+1})$ with eigenvalue $-1$ ? How does the claim follow from the fact that $GL_n(F)$ contains only $2^n$ diagonal matrices with entries $\pm 1$ ? The statement is clearly true, but each $\phi(\sigma_j)$ is diagonalizable, so there is an invertible matrix $P_j$ so that $P_j^{-1} \phi(\sigma_j) P_j$ is diagonal for all $j$ . Why can we adjoin a primitive third root of unity, $\omega$ to the field $F$ ? Does this just mean we replace $F$ with $F\cup \{\omega\}$ ?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'group-isomorphism']"

4227117,Show that the Ricci form of a Kähler metric is closed (using the second Bianchi identity),"Let $g = (g_{i \overline{j}})$ be a Kähler metric. The Ricci form $\rho$ is a closed real $(1,1)$ -form, which can locally be written as $$\rho = i \partial \overline{\partial} \log (\det(g)),$$ and from this local expression, we see that $d \rho =0$ . I want a proof of $d \rho =0$ directly from the second Bianchi identity. To this end, let $R_{i\overline{j} k \overline{\ell}}$ denote the Riemannian curvature tensor of $g$ . The Ricci curvature is given by $$\text{Ric}_{i \overline{j}} = g^{k \overline{\ell}} R_{i \overline{j}k\overline{\ell}}.$$ Hence, we can write $\rho = i \sum_{i,j} \text{Ric}_{i\overline{j}} dz_i \wedge d\overline{z}_j$ , and we want to show that $$d \rho = i \sum_{\alpha, i,j} \nabla_{\alpha} \text{Ric}_{i \overline{j}} dz_{\alpha} \wedge dz_i \wedge d\overline{z}_j + \nabla_{\overline{\alpha}} \text{Ric}_{i\overline{j}} d\overline{z}_{\alpha} \wedge dz_i \wedge d\overline{z}_j =0.$$ The second Bianchi identity can be expressed as $\nabla_m R_{i\overline{j}k\overline{\ell}} = \nabla_i R_{m \overline{j} k \overline{\ell}}$ . Therefore, $$\nabla_{\alpha} \text{Ric}_{i\overline{j}} = g^{k\overline{\ell}} \nabla_{\alpha} R_{i\overline{j}k\overline{\ell}}=g^{k\overline{\ell}}\nabla_iR_{\alpha\overline{j}k\overline{\ell}}= \nabla_i \text{Ric}_{\alpha\overline{j}},$$ and similarly, $$\nabla_{\overline{\alpha}} \text{Ric}_{i\overline{j}}=\nabla_{\overline{j}}\text{Ric}_{i\overline{\alpha}}.$$ At this point, I suspect that I want to use the skew-symmetry of the wedge product.

4227159,Characterization of Lipschitz derivative,"Let $f \colon O \to \mathbb R$ be continuously differentiable, where $O \subset \mathbb R^n$ is open and convex. Then, the following two assertions are equivalent: $\nabla f$ is Lipschitz-continuous with constant $1$ , i.e., $$ \| \nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x) \| \le \| y - x \| \qquad \forall x,y \in O.$$ we have $$ \bigl| (\nabla f(y) - \nabla f(x) )^\top (y - x) \bigr| \le \|y - x\|^2 \qquad\forall x,y \in O.$$ I am looking for a concise proof or a reference for this equivalence. The direction $1 \Rightarrow 2$ is just an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The other direction is slightly harder. Let me outline a proof. If we assume additionally $f \in C^2$ , then by using $y = x + t h$ , with fixed $h \in \mathbb R^n$ in 2, we obtain $$ |h^\top \nabla^2f(x) h| \le \| h \|^2 \qquad\forall x \in O, h \in \mathbb R^n$$ by passing to the limit $t \to 0$ .
Since $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is symmetric, this yields $\| \nabla^2 f(x) \| \le 1$ and the Lipschitz continuity of $\nabla f$ follows.
In the general case, one can apply this argument to the mollification $f_\epsilon = f \mathbin\star \psi_\epsilon$ , where $\psi_\epsilon$ is a standard mollifier. Is it possible give a direct proof of $2 \Rightarrow 1$ without the 'detour' to $C^2$ -functions? By the way: Although the statements 1 and 2 only depend on $\nabla f$ , the equivalence no longer holds if $\nabla f$ is replaced by an arbitrary, continuous function $g \colon O \to \mathbb R^n$ : Use, e.g., $g(x) = A x$ , where $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$ is skew symmetric.","['multivariable-calculus', 'calculus', 'lipschitz-functions']"

4227402,Deligne category $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t)$ is abelian,"I am reading Deligne & Milne's notes on tannakian categories. In this document, the authors defin the notion of Deligne categories, $\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t)$ , let me give a rough introduction to this sort of categories and what I am confused about. One of the main interest of this paper is neutral Tannakian categories, which can be defined in two equivalent ways: A category $\mathcal{C}$ which is rigid abelian tensor such that $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{1})=k$ is a field ( $\mathbf{1}$ is ""the"" identity object) and $\mathcal{C}$ is equipped with an exact faithful $k$ -linear tensor functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Vect}_k$ , the latter category indicates the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over $k$ . Such a functor, if exists, is called a fiber functor. The category $\mathrm{Rep}_k(G)$ consists of finite dimensional representations of a given affine group scheme $G$ over $k$ , i.e. its objects are pairs $(V,\rho)$ , $\mathrm{dim}_k(V) < +\infty$ and $\rho: G \to GL_V$ is considered as a morphism of functors $k-\mathbf{Alg} \to \mathbf{Grp}$ . The fiber functor in this case is just the forgetful functor. The purpose of the last example $1.27$ in chapter $1$ in DM's note is to show a counterexample, i.e. a rigid tensor abelian category such that $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{1})$ is a field but it can not be endowed a fibered functor. The key point is to look at categorical ranks of objects. Ranks in $\mathrm{Rep}_k(G)$ are nonnegative integers, here Deligne creates catgories with ranks are intermediates. Let denote $\mathcal{C}_0$ be the category with objects are symbols $T^{a,b}$ ( $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ ), morphism sets $$\mathrm{Hom}(T^{a,b},T^{c,d}) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z}[t][S_{a+d}] & \text{if} \ a + d = b + c \\ 0 & \text{other cases} \end{cases}.$$ The tensor product is simply $T^{a,b} \otimes T^{c,d} = T^{a+c,b+d}$ . Define $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{C_0}^{add}$ be the additive envelope of $\mathcal{C_0}$ , i.e. formally adding direct sums. This category fails the positivity because $\mathrm{rank}(T^{1,0})=t$ is not in $\mathbb{N}$ , the ground ring, however, is $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ , not a field so we extend it to $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ to obtain a new category, let denote it by $\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathbb{Q}(t)$ . Finally, we consider the Karoubian envelope $(\mathcal{C} \otimes \mathbb{Q}(t))^{kar}=\underline{\mathrm{Rep}}(GL_t)$ (formally adjoining images of idempotents) this category has several properties: $\mathrm{rank}(T^{1,0})$ is not an integer, of course! The endormophism set of every object is semisimple algebra by using Maschke theorem, as they are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}(t)[S]$ for certain symmetric group $S$ . It is Karoubian, i.e. every idempotent has image. First question . That is, this category is ""almost"" rigid abelian tensor and what I want to prove is to prove it is indeed abelian , I don't have a clue to this so many thanks for any suggestion. Second question . Deligne wrote down an isomorphism for $$\mathrm{Hom}(T^{a,b},T^{c,d}) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[t]} \mathbb{C} \to \mathrm{Hom}_{GL_V}(V^{\otimes a} \otimes V^{* \otimes b}, V^{\otimes c} \otimes V^{* \otimes d}).$$ in which $V$ is finite-dim $\mathbb{C}$ -vector space and $n=\mathrm{dim}(V) \geq a + d$ , $\mathbb{C}$ is a $\mathbb{Z}[t]$ algebra under the morphism $\mathbb{Z}[t] \to \mathbb{C}, t \mapsto n$ . My question here is what exactly is the morphism above? Why should we consider the action of $GL_V$ here? I guess the RHS is somehow related to Schur-Weyl duality but I cannot write it explicitly. I don't even think we need this isomorphism to conclude $\mathrm{End}(\bigoplus T^{a,b}) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}[t]} \mathbb{C}$ is semisimple for some sum $\bigoplus T^{a,b}$ . Update . The first question is done, it is a special of theorem $2$ in U. Jannsen, Motives, numerical equivalence, and semi-simplicity . If $\mathcal{C}$ is $k$ -linear, Karoubian and endomorphism semisimple then $\mathcal{C}$ is abelian semisimple.","['group-schemes', 'representation-theory', 'category-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abelian-categories']"

4227500,Orthogonality relationship for solutions to the wave equation,"If I have two plane waves $e^{i k \cdot x}$ and $e^{i k' \cdot x}$ for $x, k, k' \in \mathbb{R}^d$ , I can consider them to be orthogonal in the sense that $$\int d^dx e^{i k \cdot x} \overline{e^{i k' \cdot x}} = \delta^d(k-k').$$ Now I want to restrict them to solve to the wave equation in Minkowski spacetime $\Box \phi(x) = 0$ , where $\Box := \partial_0^2 - \sum_{i = 1}^{d-1} \partial_{i}^2$ . This means I need to have $k^2 = k'^2 = 0$ , and I'd like to enforce this using a Dirac delta function, so that I consider a basis of solutions to the equation to be $$\Phi_k(x) :=\delta(k^2)e^{i k \cdot x}.$$ I then want write down an orthogonality condition on these basis elements, and I arrive at $$\int d^dx \delta(k^2) e^{i k \cdot x} \overline{\delta(k'^2)e^{i k' \cdot x}} = \delta(k^2)\delta(k'^2)\delta^d(k-k') = \delta(k^2)^2\delta^d(k-k'),$$ where in the last equality I set $k'^2 = k^2$ on support of $\delta^d(k-k')$ . It's clear to me that I'm missing something here, because I don't want to have the square of the Dirac delta function. So how can I write down an orthogonality relationship between $\Phi_k(x)$ and $\Phi_{k'}(x)$ that doesn't introduce $\delta(k^2)^2$ ? If I restrict to $k^2 = k'^2 = 0$ without using the Dirac delta function and instead think of these as some additional constraints that I enforce algebraically then I end up with $\delta^d(k-k')$ constrained to $k^2 = k'^2 = 0$ . Then I seem to have shifted the problem so that I now have two null vectors which cover only a $d-1$ dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ , but they're set equal using a $d$ dimensional delta function.

If this holds, then to prove $G\approx G'$ I only need to consider the map between their generators and check the relation of $G$ hold for $G'$ w.r.t. the corresponding generators. However, I cannot prove or disprove the statement above. I think the problem lies in how to formalize the group presentation and its properties. Inspired by the comments:
What if $\varphi$ is defined from $S\rightarrow G'$ ? Can we extend it to a homomorphism from $G\rightarrow G'$ given that $\varphi(a_1),\ldots,\varphi(a_n)$ follow the same rules in $R$ ?

This is certainly possible if $R=K$ is a field. Then $K[[X]]$ is a discrete valuation ring, i.e. a local PID with maximal ideal $\mathfrak =\langle X\rangle$ . In this case all ideals are of the form $\langle X^k\rangle$ which are polynomials. This is also possible for $R$ a complete local ring. In this case the Weierstraß preparation theorem holds which allows us to write any $f\in R[[X]]$ (uniquely) as the product of a unit and a so-called distinguished polynomial $F$ . Hence we may replace $f$ by $F$ and are done. I am not sure whether something similar is possible for, say, $R=\mathbb Z$ . Is there are general theorem on this situation?

&=\log(\Phi(e^{A}\times \cdot{}\times e^{-A},t))\\

Edit: $A$ contains its residue field. Next, consider the $k$ -algebra homomorphism $\phi: k[x_1,\ldots, x_d] \to A$ defined as $\phi(x_i)=f_i$ .

4227961,Every continuous function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ is a quotient map,"A continuous surjection $f:X\to Y$ is a quotient map if the topology on $Y$ is the final topology with respect to $f$ , namely, for each subset $F\subset Y$ , $F$ is closed if $f^{-1}(F)$ is closed in $X$ . Equivalently, for each saturated closed subset $B$ of $X$ , $f(B)$ is closed in $Y$ .  (Here, saturated = saturated with respect to $f$ , i.e., saturated with respect to the fibers $f^{-1}(y)$ .) All the examples of a map that is not quotient that I could find in various references or on this site were always a little complicated.  So I tried to find a simple example of a continuous map from the reals to the reals that is not a quotient map.  After a while I realized it is not possible: Every continuous map $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a quotient map, when viewed a surjection onto its image. Apart from checking that my reasoning below is correct, can you provide a different proof?  Specifically, is this a consequence of some more general topological results? Proof of result: Let $X=Y=\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ be a continuous map from $X$ to $Y$ .
Let $B$ be a saturated closed set in $X$ .  We have to show that $f(B)$ is closed in $f(X)$ .  Suppose that is not the case.  So we can find $a\in X$ with $f(a)\notin f(B)$ , but such that $f(a)$ is a limit point of $f(B)$ .  There is a sequence $(x_n)$ in $B$ such that $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(a)$ .  Taking a subsequence if necessary, we can assume that $f(x_n)$ converges monotonically to $f(a)$ .  Without loss of generality, say it's an increasing sequence, and $a<x_1$ . We have $f(x_1)<f(x_n)<f(a)$ , so by the intermediate value theorem there is a $z_n\in[a,x_1]$ such that $f(z_n)=f(x_n)$ .  Since $B$ is saturated, the point $z_n$ also belongs to $B$ .  Thus $(z_n)$ is a bounded sequence in $B$ and by compactness there is a subsequence converging to a point $z\in B$ (because $B$ is closed).  Replacing $(z_n)$ again by that subsequence, we can assume $z_n$ converges to $z$ , and by continuity of $f$ we have $f(z_n)$ converging to $f(z)$ .  But that is the same as $f(x_n)$ , which converges to $f(a)$ .  So $f(a)=f(z)$ did belong to $f(B)$ after all.","['general-topology', 'quotient-spaces']"

The cycle structure for $S$ is well known. For example, the expected number of cycles $C$ is given by $H_n$ , the harmonic number. We also know in the limit that the distribution is approximately Gaussian with mean and variance $\log n$ . Let $0<r<n$ . But what about permutations conditioned on the number of cycles being at least $r$ .
Obviously now a lower bound for the number of cycles is $r$ .
I know the expected number of cycles can be written as $$ \frac{\sum_{i=k}^n i.s(n,i)}{\sum_{i=k}^n s(n,i)}$$ where $s(n,m)$ is the unsigned stirling number of the first kind. But I don't know how to simplify that. My guess is that the expected number of cycles would be asymptotically something like $$r+\log (n-r)?$$ Is there a better way to count this number, or can this be simplified (asymptotically)?
If it helps, I would be interested for example when $r\approx \sqrt{n}$ . Are there any references for this problem or similar? I couldn't really find anything that discussed this problem.

Does simply applying this to the derivative of $f$ give that the implication in my question is true? My second question is how does the second Fréchet derivative of $f$ differ from the Fréchet derivative of the gradient mapping of $f$ (i.e. the Hessian). The issue is probably that I'm just still struggling with the concepts... Edit: So the definition I have for $k$ times continuously differentiable is that all partial derivatives of order less than or equal to $k$ exists and are continuous.

4228192,"Are these permutations, combinations, or something in-between? How many are they? How can they be enumerated?","Taking this post as starting point: Number of permutations of AABBBCC, taking 7 letters at a time, when repititions are allowed My case is slightly different, in the sense that, if my letters are, say, AABBC, the non-redundant permutations are of course $30 = \frac {5!} {2! 2! 1!}$ : AABBC AABCB AACBB ... CBBAA however, for my purposes, these 2 permutations are equivalent: AABBC BBAAC and so are these: CAABB CBBAA etc. i.e. I can swap any groups of letters that appear the same number of times . This is because I am interested in finding all the possible ways I can form ordered sets of groups of objects, where the identity of the objects themselves however does not matter: it only matters that they are the same. So, to be clear, if I had AAB, all $3 = \frac {3!} {2! 1!}$ non-redundant permutations would be considered distinct: AAB ABA BAA Instead, if I had AABB, the $6 = \frac {4!} {2! 2!}$ non-redundant permutations: AABB ABAB ABBA BAAB BABA BBAA are for my purposes 2 by 2 'equivalent', because e.g. AABB and BBAA both indicate putting 2 identical objects first and second, and the other 2 identical objects third and fourth; ABAB and BABA both indicate putting 2 identical objects first and third, and the other 2 identical objects second and fourth. And so on. I hope I am making sense. What I do not know, and would please like to have some advice about, is: is there a 'formal' mathematical definition for this kind of arrangement of letters or objects, with he specific type of equivalence I described? how do I calculate how many I should expect in total, given the distinct letters and the number of times they must appear? how do I generate all of them, without generating first all non-redundant permutations and eliminating a posteriori the equivalent ones? For point 2, my current guess is that I need to start from the frequencies of each letter, and make a summary of how many letters there are, by the number of times they appear (their frequency). E.g. if A, B, C appear $2, 2, 1$ times respectively, as in my initial example, I have: $freq = 2: 2 \ letters$ $freq = 1: 1 \ letter$ Then I divide by the counts of letters (not by the frequencies). So for AABBC, $30 = \frac {5!} {2! 2! 1!} \cdot \frac 1 {2 \cdot 1} = 15$ . This seems about right. If I use package arrangements in R: permutations(c(""A"",""B"",""C""), freq = c(2,2,1))

How many words can we assemble without the substrings $'ab'$ and $'bc'$ ? define the recursive formula. define the generating function for this formula. $Solution.A.$ For the first sub-question, we consider 3 disjoint cases: $$a_{n}^{c}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'c' }$$ $$a_{n}^{b}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'b' }$$ $$a_{n}^{a}=\text{the number of valid words with length of $n$, starting with 'a' }$$ For the first case, we can add $'c'$ at the beginning of the word and then take a valid word with a length of $n-1$ . Therefore, we have $a_{n-1}$ options for this case. For the second case, we use the complement method. We can take all valid words starting with $'b'$ and then get rid of all the options for words with a length of $n-2$ starting with $'c'$ . So we have: $a^{b}_{n}=a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$ options. For the third case, we use the complement method. We can take all valid words starting with $'a'$ and then get rid of all the options for words with a length of $n-2$ starting with $'b'$ . So we have: $$a_{n}^{a} =a_{n-1} -a_{n-1}^{b} =a_{n-1} -( a_{n-2} -a_{n-3}) =a_{n-1} -a_{n-2} +a_{n-3}$$ options.

4228353,Determine the maximum of $f(x) = x + \sqrt{4-x^2}$ without calculus,"I was given this problem in a Calc BC course while we were still doing review, so using derivatives or any sort of calculus was generally forbidden. We were only doing review because a lot of people hadn't taken Calc AB due to scheduling issues so the teacher felt he should at least cover some of what would be covered in AB for a while. Of course using calculus this problem is quite trivial. $f'(x) = x/\sqrt{4-x^2}$ , set this equal to zero and the maximum occurs at ( $\sqrt2$ , $2\sqrt2$ ). But again, this method was not allowed. I immediately recognized the $\sqrt{4-x^2}$ as a semicircle with maximum value at 2, so I knew that because x was being added, the value must be greater than 2 at the maximum. Also, the x value must be less than two. I then attempted to rearrange the equation such that it could be written in polar coordinates but, letting $y=f(x)$ caused $x^2$ to cancel out and I was left with $y^2 = 2x\sqrt{4-x^2}$ which only seems to complicate the equation further. I've been stuck at this point for a while as I haven't thought too much about the problem, but my teacher dismissed the problem as he didn't realize he had assigned it. Regardless, this was in the pre-calculus portion of our textbook, so I assume that there has to be a way to solve it (our textbook only gives solutions for odd problems).","['optimization', 'calculus', 'maxima-minima', 'algebra-precalculus']"

Is there a standard way of identifying these objects? Is there a standard way of denoting the multiplicity across inner sets/tuples? By way of example, we'll take the set of primitive Pythagorean triples as tuples: $$S := \{(a,b,c) \in \mathbb{N}^3 \mid [a^2 + b^2 = c^2] \land [\gcd (a,b,c) = 1] \land [a < b < c] \}$$ $$S = \{(3,4,5), (5,12,13), (8, 15, 17), \cdots\}$$ Obviously $5 \not \in S$ , because every element of $S$ is a tuple.

If not, is there a standard correct method? I think that if we have indexed/ordered sets and tuples, we can identify individual elements with typical notation. For instance, if we use $c$ to order the tuples, we could say that $s_{1,3} = s_{2,1} = 5$ . But how does one specify the ordering of the tuples mathematically? Or is a well-ordered set of tuples a mathematical impossibility? And is there any notation for the multiplicity of an object across the inner sets/tuples of the set?

On the contrary, I came up with a different (read: easier) proof. But there might be loopholes in it. I am a newbie in discrete maths and I would be glad if someone could possibly point out a mistake in my proof. 2n ambassadors are invited to a banquet. Every ambassador has at most n−1
enemies. Prove that the ambassadors can be seated around a round table, so that
nobody sits next to an enemy. Proof:
Say we place all people around a round table in any arbitrary order. Say H is the total sum of all cases when we have a person sitting adjacent to his enemy. If H=0, we are done. Otherwise, Case 1: P is sitting adjacent to 2 enemies. Leaving P and his 2 enemies, we have at most n-3 enemies and at least n-1 friends. Placing the n-3 enemies, we have n-2 gaps between them, by pigeonhole principle, we see at least n-1 people in n-2 gaps, hence at least 1 gap should contain 2 friends thus we place P between them and H decreases. Case 2:  P is sitting adjacent to 1 enemy. Leaving P and his enemy and the friend beside him, we have at most n-2 enemies and at least n-2 friends. Placing the n-2 enemies, we have n-1 gaps between them, so at least one gap remains empty, we place P between 2 enemies then do according to case 1 and H decreases. So H $>=$ 0 always so we cannot keep on decreasing H forever, we have to reach a minimum, hence H=0 will be the minimum and then we will be done.",['discrete-mathematics']
4228743,Prove that there exists infinitely many prime numbers of the form 4k+3 for some integer k.,"We shall prove this theorem by contradiction. Assume $p_n$ is the largest prime number of the form 4 $k_n$ +3 for some n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ . Consider an odd value of n. Even if n is even, we could miss one of the prime numbers to get an odd n. Now, consider \begin{align*}
N &= 2(4 k_1 +3)(4 k_2 +3)(4k_3+3)...(4 k_n +3) + 1 \\
  &= 4m + 2\cdot 3^n + 1 \\ 
  &= 4m + 2\cdot (4-1)^n + 1 \\
  &= 4m + 2\cdot 4a -2 + 1 \\
  &= 4m + 2\cdot 4a -1 \\
  &= 4m + 3 
\end{align*} for some m,a $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ Two cases are possible. N is definitely not divisible by 4 $k_i$ +3 i $\in$ [1,n]. All numbers between 4 $k_n$ +3 and N are composite $\implies$ they are formed from a unique prime factorisation of the finite set of prime numbers. Then N is prime. so contradiction. There is a new prime between 4 $k_n$ +3 and N of the form 4k+3 so N is a multiple of that prime(Note that N cannot be a multiple of 4k+1 since we have 2 occurring only once in our expression for N-1), which any way is again a contradiction. My prof said that this proof misses some cases but I am unable to figure out which case. Please help. I feel pretty confident of my proof.",['discrete-mathematics']
4228751,How to write a function that is the sum of all $y$ values at some $x$ value of a relation,"For example, if I had the relation: $x^3 + 3x^2 + y^3 - y^2 - 15y + 20 = 0$ , and I wanted to find the sum of all $y$ values at $x=1$ . So if my new function was $f(x)$ , then $f(1)$ would be about $3.5 + 1.7 + (-4) = 1.2$ . How would I write such a function on desmos? Maybe I could simplify and rewrite the relation, but that might not work for other relations.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'polynomials', 'graphing-functions']"
4228753,Is a principal bundle over a discrete base space necessarily trivial?,"Let $X$ be a topological space with discrete topology. More concretely, one can think of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ . Then, is it true that any principal $G-$ bundle over $X$ is trivial? Here $G$ is an arbitrary Lie group. I feel this way because every one-point set is open in $X$ but cannot prove rigorously myself.. Could anyone please help me?","['general-topology', 'principal-bundles']"
