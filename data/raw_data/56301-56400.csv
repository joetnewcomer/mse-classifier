611949,Arzela-Ascoli and adjoint of compact operator compact,"I have seen in this thread a nice answer where it is shown that Thread that the adjoint operator of a compact operator is compact by using the Arzela Ascoli theorem. Unfortunately, there is one thing I do not understand: It is not shown that $(f_n)_n$ is closed, so why is this sequence compact then? It is only shown that it is equicontinuous and bounded but not closed and since we derive from Arzela Ascoli that there is a convergent subsequence we probably need compactness. I should point how we formulated Arzela Ascoli: Let $M \subset C(S)$ where $S$ is a compact set, then $M$ is compact iff: $M$ is bounded, closed and equicontinuous.

611997,Weak and almost everywhere convergence,"Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded domain. Suppose that $p\in (1,\infty)$ . Assume that the sequence $u_n\in L^p(\Omega)$ satisfies: There is $u,w\in L^p(\Omega)$ such that $u_n\to u$ a.e. in $\Omega$ and $u_n$ weakly converge to w in $L^p(\Omega)$ . Can we conclude that $u=w$ ? I was trying to prove this result by using Mazur lemma , which says that the sequence $$v_n=\sum_{k=n}^{f(n)}\alpha_{k,n}u_k\to w\ \mbox{in}\ L^p(\Omega)$$ where $f(n)\geq n$ and $\sum_{k=n}^{f(n)}\alpha_{k,n}=1$ . We can assume without loss of generality that $v_n(x)\to w(x)$ a.e. in $\Omega$ . Now, I want to use the fact that $u_n$ to $u$ a.e. everywhere to conclude that $v_n\to u$ a.e. Can I do this? Update: I think I could finish the proof, please verify it to me. Fix $x\in \Omega$ such that $u_n(x)\to u(x)$ . Note that $$|v_n(x)-u(x)|=\left|\sum_{k=n}^{f(n)}\alpha_{k,n}(u_k(x)-u(x))\right|\leq \sum_{k=n}^{f(n)}|\alpha_{k,n}(u_k(x)-u(x))|\tag{1}$$ For any $\delta>0$ choose $N$ um such a way that if $n\geq N$ then $|u_n(x)-u(x)|\leq\delta$ then, from $(1)$ we conclude that $$|v_n(x)-u(x)|\leq \delta$$","['weak-convergence', 'functional-analysis']"

612002,"if $\|x+y\|=\|x\|+\|y\|$, then $\|\alpha x+\beta y\|=\alpha \|x\|+\beta \|y\|$","Let $X$ be a normed linear space. Assume that for $x,y \in X$, we have $||x+y||=||x||+||y||$. Show that $||\alpha x+\beta y||=\alpha ||x||+\beta ||y||$ for every $\alpha,\beta \geq 0$. My attempt: Suppose $\beta \geq \alpha$. Then $\|\alpha x+\beta y\|=\|\alpha (x+y)-(\alpha-\beta)y\| \leq |\alpha|(\|x\|+\|y\|)+|\beta - \alpha|\|y\|=\alpha\|x\|+\beta\|y\|$. Since the inequality is true for all $\alpha,\beta \geq 0$ and $\beta \geq \alpha$, if we let $\alpha=\beta=1$, we have $||x+y|| \leq |x||+||y||$. If the inequality is a strict inequality, then this contradicts with $\|x+y\|=\|x\|+\|y\|$. Hence, we must have equality, which is the desired result. Is my proof correct?

612147,How to demonstrate the equality of these integral representations of $\pi$?,"Each of the three following definite integrals are well known to have the same value of $\pi$: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\,\mathrm{d}x=2\int_{-1}^1\sqrt{1-x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1+x^2}\,\mathrm{d}x=\pi.$$ I like taking the first definite integral as the definition of $\pi$, since it represents half the circumference of the unit circle. The second integral obviously represents the area of the unit circle, but as an exercise I wanted to prove its equality with integral #1 using just elementary integration rules.

 \DeclareMathOperator{\lcm}{lcm}$In using Guassian elimination to put a matrix into Smith normal form over $\mathbb{Z}$ (or, more generally, some PID ), the last step is to make sure that successive diagonal entries divide each other.  Solving this reduces to the following problem (with all matrices over $\mathbb{Z}$): given a diagonal matrix $M = \left( \begin{array}{cc} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{array} \right)$, find invertible matrices $L$, $R$ such that 
$$ M = L \left( \begin{array}{cc} \gcd(a,b) & 0 \\ 0 & \lcm(a,b) \end{array} \right) R $$ This is of course well-known and not hard to do.  For instance, using the Euclidean algorithm to find $(x,y)$ such that $ax + by = d = \gcd(a,b)$, one can define $$ L = \left( \begin{array}{cc} a/d & -y \\ b/d & x \end{array} \right),
 \quad R = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1-yb/d & yb/d \\ -1 & 1 \end{array} \right)$$

\quad R = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1-yb/d & b/d \\ -y & 1 \end{array} \right).$$ However, in the special case where $a$ divides $b$, we know that $M$ is already as desired and so we could simply take $L = R = I$.  My question is: can we find a general algebraic solution like the ones above (i.e. algebraic definitions of $L$, $R$ in terms of the integers $(x,y,a/d,b/d)$), but with the additional property that when $a$ divides $b$ (and so $x=1$, $y=0$, $a/d=1$), the solution yields $L = R = I$?

By a conditional random variable for $X$ given $Y$, a ""pseudo"" random variable $(X|Y)$ with the density function $f_{X|Y = y}(x) = \frac{f_{(X,Y)}(x,y)}{f_Y(Y)}$. Does this path lead to ambiguity or contradiction?  It seems pretty straight-forward to interpret $(X|Y)$ as a function from the sample space of $Y$ to the random variable $X$, so that $X$ is a random random variable.  But is this abuse of notation sound? More generally, what kinds of functions can be composed to make random variables while remaining consistent with ""the"" axioms of probability (i.e., some sensible foundation)? Perhaps tangentially, is there a categorical interpretation?  In particular, it would be nice if $(X|Y)$ and $Y$ are an adjoint pair. This question has got some attention recently, so I thought I'd try to clarify my question again: I guess my question is ""how can we define choosing a random variable randomly?"" After all, we can pick a random matrix, random people, random heights, etc.  So why not arbitrary real functions? Presumably, this would require a probability distribution to assign densities to real functions.  This may not even be possible in the ""general"" case, and this might be a reason why the construction I'm trying to get at is unsound. But it certainly seems that we can define conditional random variables for ""classes"" of random variables, for example by treating a parameter of a probability distribution as a random variable. Conditional expectation seems to be another instance of the idea. So there seems to be a tension between these instances and the ""fact"" that it can't be done in general.  I am hoping someone can talk to us about it. :-)",['probability-theory']
612470,Doubt about Proposition 2.39 in Dana Williams' crossed product book,"You can see the proposition in a google books preview here . First and foremost, my question is: Question: Am I correct to interpret Proposition 2.39 as setting up a bijective correspondence between The set of nondegenerate covariant homomorphisms  $(\pi,u) : (A,G,\alpha) \to \mathcal{L}(X)$. The set of nondegenerate homomorphisms $L : A \rtimes_\alpha G \to \mathcal{L}(X)$. by sending each $(\pi,u)$ to $L = \pi \rtimes u$ and sending each $L$ to the $(\pi,u)$ defined by $\pi(a) = \overline{L}(i_A(a)), u_s = \overline{L}(i_G(s))$ for all $a \in A, s \in G$. I don't really have a mathematical reason to doubt this reading is correct. My reasons are slightly meta, so I hope I am making myself understood. The immediately following Proposition 2.40 would seem, in part, to be a corollary, where the Hilbert $B$-module $X$ is taken to be a Hilbert space. Now, in Proposition 2.40 Williams states explicitly that a bijective correspondence is being set up, whereas in Proposition 2.39 this is only implicit. That in and of itself would not be enough to raise my eyebrows, but, have a look at the 1st paragraph of the proof of Proposition 2.40. ""Proposition 2.39 on the facing page shows that the map $(\pi,U) \mapsto \pi \rtimes U$ is a surjection. It's one-to-one in view of Equations (2.21) and (2.27)."" I don't understand the need for the reference to equations (2.21) and (2.27).

Define $s=-y$ Let $U := u(\overline{z})=u(x,-y)=u(x,s)$ : $$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \Rightarrow \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$
And $$\frac{\partial U}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \frac{\partial s}{\partial y}  = - \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}  $$
Similarly $$\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial y^2}=   \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial y} ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial y}) \right] =- \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial y} ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}) \right] = ... = - \left[ - \frac{\partial }{\partial s} ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}) \right] = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial s^2}  $$ Hence
$$\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial y^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial s^2}= 0 \ \ \ (*)$$ Therefore $u(\overline{z})$ is also harmonic. * My Questions is : Is my try problematic?Does $(*)$ needs justification? *",['complex-analysis']

612553,"Sum of difference of numbers in an arrangement of the numbers $0,1,2,\cdots, n$","A seemingly interesting (easy?) problem came to mind and I thought it would be nice to ask your opinion about it. Suppose we are going to arrange numbers $0$ to $n$ in a row in such a way that the sum of the difference between adjacent numbers is max. How could we accomplish this? How could we determine the maximum sum of the difference? How about the minimum? As an example let us take the numbers $0,1,2,3,4$. Let us look at some arrangements: $0,1,2,3,4$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $1,1,1,1$ so the sum is $4$ $1,3,4,0,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $2,1,4,2$ so the sum is $9$ $1,4,0,3,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $3,4,3,1$ so the sum is $11$ $3,0,4,1,2$; the difference between the adjacent numbers are $3,4,3,1$ so the sum is $11$ I figured that the arrangement that will give us the minimum sum is the arrangement $1,2,3,...,n$ because all the difference would just be $1$ and their sum is $n-1$. I think the maximum sum can be attained by arranging the numbers in the following way: Place the number $n$ between $0$ and $1$. Then place $n-1$ next to $0$ and $n-2$ next to $1$ and so on. An additional question, if we already know the minimum and maximum would it be possible to always get an arrangement that will give a sum for all the values between the minimum and the maximum? I tried it with $0,1,2,3$ and I was able to find arrangements for all the values between $3$ and $7$. Maybe this problem has been asked before but I can't find it on the net. Any ideas?

P(both dice are six)= $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$. P(at least one six)= $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{36}=\frac{11}{36}=30.6\%$ This is what explained in the video.

The clue is to use Baire's Category Theorem. I can't see how to do that, and can't see the connection to Baire's category theorem.
Intuitively, I agree that this seems reasonable, since any intersection of open sets is a set with non empty interior (am I right about that?). So, if $\mathbb{Q}$ were an intersection like that it would contain an open interval (again, hope I am right would like to know if not.). But, I guess this is not a proof, and, can't see the connection to Baire's theorem. Thank you!!

612879,Integral $\int_1^\infty\frac{dx}{1+2^x+3^x}$,"Can the integral $$\int_1^\infty\dfrac{dx}{1+2^x+3^x}$$ be given in closed form? This question arises naturally when I considered doing integrals. What makes an integral hard? Well, the integrand, of course. So why is it hard to integrate some integrands? For starters, I need to say that there are definite and indefinite integrals and that might affect the difficulty of the integral, but in both cases the situation seems the same. Let's say $f(x)$ is the (elementary) integrand. For starters, consider short expressions for $f(x)$. That makes sense, because logically long expressions are harder to integrate on average. So, we consider elementary functions $f(x)$ with a short expression. If $f(x)$ is mainly a product of simple functions, in other words, if $f(x)$ contains more products then sums then by using integration by parts it is clear that the integral of $f(x)$ is more likely to be 'solvable'. Similarly, if $f(x)$ contains more products than compositions, it is easier in general. So, in order of difficulty: $$ \text{products}<\text{compositions}<\text{sums} $$ The argument: there is only one formula for sums when it comes to integrals or derivatives and that is the trivial $\int a(x) + b(x) dx = \int a(x) dx + \int b(x) dx$
or $(a(x)+b(x))' = (a(x))' + (b(x))'$. However, the formula for products and compositions are more powerful and lead more to success. As an example, I will give three integrals of about the same notational length.
They are similar but the argument above seems to make a point. Which of the functions below do you consider easier to integrate? $$\color{Red}{\sin(x) (e^x + \cos(x))},\,\,  \color{Blue}{e^{\sin(x)} \cos(x)}\,  \text{or}\color{Green}{\dfrac{1+\cos(x)}{e^x+\sin(x)}}?$$ Or maybe some examples from MSE itself? Consider the list of integrals below. $$\int_1^\infty\dfrac{\operatorname{arccot}\left(1+\frac{2\pi}{\operatorname{arcoth}x-\operatorname{arccsc}x}\right)}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}\,dx$$ This value is known to agree with a closed form for the first $9000$ digits, yet no satisfactory proof has been given. All the following integrals, though, have closed forms: $$\int_{-1}^1\frac1x\sqrt{\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}}\ln\left(\frac{2\,x^2+2\,x+1}{2\,x^2-2\,x+1}\right) \, dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{\ln\left(x+\sqrt2\right)}{\sqrt{2-x}\,\sqrt{1-x}\,\sqrt{\vphantom{1}x}}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\log\log\left(\dfrac{1}{x}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2}-1}\right)\, dx$$ $$\int_0^\infty\dfrac{\ln\left(1+x+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x}\right)\,\ln\left(1+\sqrt{x^2+2\,x+2}\right)}{x^2+2x+1}\,dx$$ $$\int_0^1\dfrac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x}\ \sqrt[4]x\ \sqrt[4]{2-x\,\sqrt3}}$$ $$\int_0^{\frac{\ln^22}4}\,\dfrac{\arccos\frac{\exp\sqrt x}{\sqrt2}}{1-\exp\sqrt{4\,x}}\,dx$$ So, why is the first one so much more difficult or impossible? Note that the first integral contains more additions while the others have more compositions and products. Those compositions and products lead to possible ways to attack the problem with substitutions, pattern recognitions, integration by parts and rewritting them as (not too complicated) infinite sums. Many deceivingly simple looking integrals are of the form $\displaystyle\int f\left(\frac{1}{a(x)+b(x)}\right)g(x)\,dx$, where $a$ and $b$ are not both polynomials and $f$ is not the exponential, sine or cosine. It is also hard to see how to use contour integrals to deal with integrands that contain a lot of sums, in particular when $\int_1^{\infty}f(x)\,dx$ does not equal an integer. There have been complains about a lack of motivation for posting integrals on MSE, so hereby I did show my motivation. As for showing how far I got, I must admit I am nowhere. I do not know how to start with this integral since all the methods I know well do not seem to help or at least I do not see it.","['definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals', 'integration']"
612880,Scalar product and uniform convergence of polynomials,"Given two functions $u$ and $v$, you can compute $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$. It resembles the scalar product $\int_{-1}^1 u(t)v(t) \,\mathrm{d}t$, which leads to Legendre polynomials , with a major difference: while the latter is a scalar product over continuous functions, the former is not, since for $f(t)=e^t$, $(f|f)=0$. However, it's obviously a scalar product over polynomials (the solutions of $(f|f)=0$ are not polynomials, and all other defining properties of a scalar product are trivial). We can therefore find an orthonormal basis of polynomials, using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization on the basis $[1,t,t^2,...]$. Let's call $P_n$ this orthonormal basis. Now, after doing this numerically with a CAS, and after some plots, it looks like $\frac{P_n}{P_n(0)}$ tends uniformly to the function $t \to e^t$ (on $[0,1]$), a solution of $y'-y=0$, which is closely related to the definition of the scalar product above. But I don't know how to prove this. Any idea? Also, if I do the same with $(u|v)=\int_0^1 (u''(t)-u(t))(v''(t)-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$, I'm not absolutely sure, but numerically it looks like, up to a constant factor $P_{2n} \to \cos t$ and $P_{2n+1} \to \sin t$, uniformly on $[0,1]$, so the orthogonal basis of polynomials leads to a basis of solutions of $y''-y=0$. I'd like to know if the process can be generalized to other linear differential equations (provided they don't have polynomial solutions). Does it work with equations with nonconstant coefficients? This is not homework. It's something I discovered while playing with a Ti89 long ago (initially, to test a program doing Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization), and I have never been able to prove or disprove the numerical evidence. $\color{red}{\textbf{Now, why this question?}}$ Apart from mathematical curiosity, there may be some motivation: the method seems quite robust, there is convergence, probably under certain conditions, for several weight functions and differential equations. And we get uniform approximation of solutions of linear differential equations, by polynomials, which may be quite useful in practice. Since many linear ODE give rise to special functions, that would give a cheap way to compute uniform approximations of their solutions, on arbitrary (but bounded) intervals. To help visualize, here are some sample graphics done with Maxima, computed with a straightforward Gram-Schmidt algorithm. The two following are $P_4(x)/P_4(0)-\exp(x)$ and $P_9(x)/P_9(0)-\exp(x)$, in the case $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$. The division by $P_n(0)$ is only done in order to ""normalize"" polynomials, since $\exp 0=1$. Now example with ""trigonometric"" differential equation $y''+y=0$. And $(u|v) = \int_0^{2\pi} (u(t)''+u(t))(v(t)''+v(t)) \,\mathrm{d}t$. Notice the integration bound differ from the preceding, and now uniform convergence of $P_n$ takes place on $[0,2\pi]$. The normalization is here $P_{2n}(x)/P_{2n}(0)$ as $\cos 0 = 1$ ans $P_{2n+1}(x)/P_{2n+1}(\pi/2)$, as $\sin \pi/2=1$, and precisely, $P_{8}(x)/P_{8}(0)-\cos x$ and $P_{9}(x)/P_{9}(\pi/2)-\sin x$ are respectively plotted. Notice, it's also possible to add a weighting function to our scalar product, e.g. $(u|v) = \int_0^1 (u(t)'-u(t))(v(t)'-v(t)) \mathcal{W}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t$. For example, with$\mathcal{W}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{t(1-t)}}$ on $[0,1]$, there is still convergence, and for example $P_9(x)/P_9(0) -\exp x$ yields the following plot.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'orthogonal-polynomials', 'real-analysis']"

What is $[\cos x]$  ? Describe all the equivalence classes and the quotient group $A/R$. Describe a subset of $A$, in it only one element exactly from each equivalence class (a system of representatives for the quotient group). Well, first of all to make sure I understand the notation, $A=\Bbb R^{[0,1]}$ means the set of all the functions from the section $[0,1]$ to the reals right ? And the relation is when two functions are equal when $x=0$. If it was from the reals to the section then some of these functions would be the trig functions, but the other way around I don't think it would be any elementary function. In order to prove this is an equivalence relation we need to check reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity, so for reflexivity I suppose it's enough to say that $f(0)=f(0)$, symmetry: $f(0)=g(0) \rightarrow g(0)=f(0)$ and transitivity:  $f(0)=g(0) \ , \ g(0)=h(0) \Rightarrow f(0)=h(0)$. What is $[\cos x]$ ? I'm not sure I understand the notation here... I suppose the equivalence classes are functions that equal $i\in \Bbb R$ when $X=0$ so there are $i$ equivalence classes.

The problem is taken from Problem set 7: Question 4B-5. 1 Q: Find the volume of an equilateral triangle with side length a which is rotated around one of its sides. I am actually doing the calculus side okay, I believe. My difficulty is with the trigonometry/geometry setting up the problem. Here is how I set up the integral: $$
2 \int_0^\frac{a}{2} \pi(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{a}x)^2dx
$$ My integrand is apparently wrong. I've calculated $y$ to be a function of $x$ such that $y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{a}x$. The solution sets it up the integral exactly the same, except that $y = \sqrt{3}x$. Here is how I derived the integrand: Let the equilateral triangle sit with one side along the x-axis and its leftmost vertex at (0,0) and its rightmost vertex at (a, 0). The strategy will be to split the triangle in half, integrate the rotated solid around the x-axis, and multiply by two to get the whole triangle. So the function to be integrated is a simple linear f(x) from 0 to $\frac{a}{2}$. Great. But what is $f(x)$? Here's where I go wrong. I derived the slope of the line of f(x) by observing that the vertex at (0,0) is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ radians. Using sohcahtoa, I calculated the height of the triangle (i.e., $f(\frac{a}{2})$) as:$$\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})$$ To then derive the slope of f , I simply did rise-over-run, i.e. (plugging in for $\sin\frac{\pi}{3})$:
$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\div\frac{a}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{a}$$ Which is the slope of the function f(x) . I will leave it here, as I don't think the calculus is the problem. Clearly, I've done something wrong in the way I derived the slope of $f(x)$. What am I missing?

613162,A simple question about completely positive linear maps,"Let $A$ be the C*-algebra and $M_{n}(A)$ be the C*-algebra of $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $A$. We use $(a_{ij})$ to denote the element of $M_{n}(A)$. My question is: For every $a\in A$, can we verifies that$(a_{i}^{*}a^{*}aa_{j})\leq||a^{*}a||(a_{i}^{*}a_{j})$. Here, we fix $\{a_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\in A$.","['operator-theory', 'operator-algebras', 'von-neumann-algebras', 'functional-analysis']"
613164,Counting the number of sequences with these properties.,"The following question was given on an exam I wrote, and I would like to see if anyone can identify any problems with my solution. I would also be very interested if anyone has a more elegant solution. Note: if my solution is too long to look over, I won't mind if you ignore it and volunteer your own solutions to the question . Question : How many sequences of 21 coin flips consisting of 15 tails and 6 heads satisfy the following three properties: 1) the first and last coin flip results in tails; 2) there are no consecutive occurrences of heads; 3) every sequence of consecutive tails has odd length. Below is an outline of my solution: We suppose the first and last coin flip results in a tails and count the number of sequences of 19 coin flips with 13 tails and 6 heads (and adjust the above conditions appropriately). Case #1: There is a head immediately after the first tails and immediately before the last tails. The number of such sequences is given by counting how many ways we can choose the size of the ""gap"" between consecutive heads. Since we require that consecutive sequences of tails have odd length, we must have that the gaps between successive heads are of odd length. In particular, they may take the values $\{1, 3, 5, 7\}$. Solving this is equivalent to distributing 13 identical objects into 5 distinct boxes such that no box is empty. This is given by ${(13-5)+5-1\choose (13-5)}= {12 \choose 8} = {12 \choose 4}$. Case #2: There is a head immediately before the last tails, but there is some odd-length sequence of consecutive tails at the start of the sequence. Since we fixed the first tail, there must be some even-length sequence of tails following the first tail. We observe that the length of this sequence is, at most, 8 (otherwise we have an occurrence of consecutive heads). So then the length of this initial sequence of tails (not counting the first tail we fix) takes values in $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$. The number of sequences of this form is given by:
$\displaystyle\sum_{k}{(13-k-5)+5-1\choose (13-k-5)}$, for $k \in \{2,4,6,8\}$. Case #3: This case is the same as the previous one, except we consider those sequences where there is a head immediately after the first tails, and some odd-length sequence of tails at the very end (counting the last tail we fix). Case #4: In this final case, we consider all such sequences where there is some even-length sequence of consecutive tails immediately after the first tail and immediately before the last tail. As by our previous remark, these two sequences cannot have a combined length of greater than 8. So then the possible lengths of these initial and terminal sequences of consecutive tails is given by the ordered pairs $(2,2), (2, 4), (4,2), (4,4)$. So then if we index these lengths, we have $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$, and the number of such sequences is given by ${(13-j-5)+5-1\choose (13-j-5)}$ for each $j \in \{4, 6, 8\}$ except that for $j=6$ we multiply by two since there are two such possibilities.","['proof-verification', 'combinatorics']"
613183,Understanding higher order SVD,"Can someone explain the singular value decomposition of a tensor (maybe a 3 dimensional matrix) with an example? It is intuitively difficult to the get the meaning from just the formulas. On a related note, consider the following scenario. There are n cars on the road and say the distance traveled by each of them is determined only by mood of the driver(let's think that higher the value the more he drives) and number of people in the car(which is independent to the mood of the driver). If I were to model this as a 3 dimensional(distance traveled by the car, mood, number of people in car being the 3 dimensions) matrix and with some sufficient data points, can I get the distance traveled by a specific car given a mood and the number of people in the car(of course the data point is missing for this)? The real use case I have probably has more dimensions(add hour of the day as a 4th dimension). My problem is to exactly understand the process of decomposing the tensor to a singular matrix and  also, given other (n-1) points, how do I get the distance traveled by the car? Probably there are better approaches to solve this example, but I am specifically looking for this approach to understand higher order SVD.","['svd', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'numerical-linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"
613212,One point compactification of the rationals is not second countable,"As a counter example to show that second countable is a property which is not preserved under a continuous function, I consider the rationals under the discrete topology, which is second countable, and the existence of any other countable space that is not second countable is sufficient. I chose the one point compactification of the rationals as such a space because several sources say this is true, but I am very lost on how to go about proving this. I have studied other questions on this site about the compact subsets of Q, and aim to form an open set in Q* that couldn't possibly be formed by a countable union of open sets, but I do not see how this is possible. I appreciate any insight. Thanks","['general-topology', 'compactness']"
