For example $150$% of $100$ is $150$. But does the statement in the title make sense?",['probability']

2339333,Degrees of freedom in the Euclidean group: reflections?,"I apologise if this is a rather basic question- I am relatively new to group theory and geometry/topology etc. I was reading about the Euclidean Group, which Wikipedia defines as being... the symmetry group of n-dimensional Euclidean space. Its elements, the isometries associated with the Euclidean metric, are called Euclidean motions. From what I am aware, isometries include translations, rotations and reflections. However later on in the Wiki article it talks about dimensionality and degrees of freedom: Dimensionality The number of degrees of freedom for E(n) is n(n + 1)/2, which gives 3 in case n = 2, and 6 for n = 3. Of these, n can be attributed to available translational symmetry, and the remaining n(n âˆ’ 1)/2 to rotational symmetry. I was confused as to why reflections did not factor in here, although intuitively I didn't see how a reflection could be a degree of freedom either. There just seems to be something different about reflections compared with translations and rotations, although I'm not sure what (not very mathematical, I know) After reading about Classification of Euclidean plane isometries on Stack exchange, one of the answers described how you could describe any isometry by a translation, rotation and reflection by considering three points: use a translation to map one point onto its image, a rotation to map the second point to its image, and finally a reflection to match the third. From this I can see how once the translation and rotation are used to match two points, the reflection used for the third is entirely determined by the isomatry- there is no more freedom in choosing the reflection, if you have used a translation and rotation to specify the mapping of two of the points. For an isometry, the final step is fixed. This kind of makes sense to me, although I am not sure if it is the best way, or even a correct way, of thinking about this. Also, the answer also stated that A non-zero translation and a non-zero rotation together are simply a rotation around some other center. A rotation followed by a reflection is a reflection in some different line. (MvG) So it seems that all combinations of translations and rotations can be described by a single reflection? So reflections 'hide' all of the degrees of freedom? I think this is related to the final point, but I admit I do not quite understand it. Perhaps some of my confusion regarding transformations and degrees of freedom is that I find myself veering towards thinking of the Euclidean group as consisting of transformations as opposed to isometries, and it seems that these are not the same (in this link, it asks about isometries being a subgroup of the reflection group)","['transformation', 'finite-groups', 'euclidean-geometry', 'metric-spaces', 'group-theory']"
2339344,"Find work done by the force field $F(x,y) = (3y^2 + 2)i + 16xj$ along the upper half of an ellipse","I'm trying to solve the following problem. (10.13.10 from Apostol Vol. 2.) Let $$ F(x,y) = (3y^2 + 2)i + 16xj $$ be a force field. I want to find the work done by $F(x,y)$ from
  $(-1,0)$ to $(1,0)$ along the upper half of the ellipse $b^2 x^2 + y^2

So $$ F(a(t)) = (3(b \sin(t) )^2 + 2)i + 16\cos(t) j $$ $$ a'(t) = -\sin(t) i + b\cos(t) j .$$ Thus the work done is $$ \int_C F ds = \int_{-\pi}^\pi F(a(t)) \cdot a'(t) dt $$ which is equal to $$ \int_{-\pi}^\pi -3b^2 \sin(t)^3 - 2\sin(t) + 16b \cos^2(t) dt. $$ This integral evaluates to $16b\pi$. I checked it both by hand and using Mathematica. However, the solution is supposed to be $4b^2 - 8\pi b + 4$.

Then $\exists c \in (a,b),$ such that $$f(b)-f(a)=f'(c) \cdot (b-a)$$ Of course, we can restrict $f$ to any interval $[x,y] \subset [a,b]$ and apply the theorem on $f|_{[c,d]}$ to state that $\exists z \in (x,y)$ such that $f(y)-f(x)=f'(z) \cdot (y-x)$ Can I formulate a converse proposition as follows?

EDIT : As pointed out by @Henrik, the proposition does not hold with it's current assumptions.

Suppose that $f$ is sequentially continuous at $a$. Prove that $f$ is continuous at $a$ in the sense of $\varepsilon-\delta$ definition. My proof: Let $\{x_k\}\subset A$ be a sequence such that $x_k$ converges to $a$. Then, since $f$ is sequentially continuous on $A$, $\forall \varepsilon >0$, $\exists k_0\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\|f(x_k)-f(a)\|<\varepsilon$ whenever $k\ge k_0$. Also, $\forall\delta >0$, $\exists k_1\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\|x_k-a\|<\delta$ whenever $k\ge k_1$. Let $k':=\max\{k_0, k_1\}$, let $k\ge k'$ (we can fix $k$), then $\|x_k-a\|<\delta\implies \|f(x_k)-f(a)\|<\varepsilon$. Hence, $f$ is continuous at $a$ in the $\varepsilon-\delta$ sense.

2339805,"Unit Quaternions on the 3-sphere, $S^3$ as orthogonal transformations.","I am reading through Andrew Hanson's ""Visualizing Quaternions"" and came across this passage on page 50: $q(\theta, {\bf n}) = \left( \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, {\bf n} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \right)$ produces the standard rotation matrix ${\bf R} \left( \theta, {\bf n} \right)$ for a rotation by $\theta$ in the plane perpendicular to ${\bf n}$, where ${\bf n} \cdot {\bf n} = 1$. $\theta$ is an angle obeying $0 \leq \theta < 4 \pi$ rather than $0 \leq \theta < 2 \pi$. This extension of the range of $\theta$ allows the values of q to reach all points of the hypersphere $S^3$. Here, $q$ represents the quaternion and ${\bf n}$ the rotation axis. To describe how I visualize $S^3$, I will first describe analogously how to visualize $S^2$. Imagine cross sections of $S^2$ as we pass from $z = 1$ to $z = -1$. The cross sections are circles of radius $\sin\beta$, where $0 \leq \beta \leq \pi$ is the usual polar angle in the spherical polar parametrization of $S^2$. If $0 \leq \alpha < 2\pi$ is the azimuth, then $\alpha$ gives a parametrization of every cross sectional circle. Now, to visualize $S^3$, I draw a set of 2-spheres, the intersections of $S^3$ with the various hyperplanes $w$ = constant, where we pass from $w = 1$ at the North Pole through the equator at $w = 0$, to the South Pole at $w = -1$. $w$ represents the real part of the quaternion. In this case, we identify $w = \cos \frac{\theta}{2}$. The North Pole and the South Pole are degenerate 2-spheres of zero radius. $\sin \frac{\theta}{2}$ represents the radius of every cross sectional 2-sphere. When $\theta = \pi$, $w = 0$, and we are at the equator of $S^3$, and the radius is unity. Here is my concern: I see no reason for extending the range of $\theta$ to cover all the points on $S^3$. $0 \leq \theta < 2 \pi$, allows us to reach every point on $S^3$, with ${\bf n}$ being a unit vector. Is this an error on the part of Hanson?","['rotations', 'quaternions', 'linear-algebra', 'geometry']"

2339869,Projectile Motion with Differential Equations,"I've been trying to write code that will calculate the required intercept angles of a projectile launch to hit a moving target, a person running around a game world. I have no issues programming things, but I need a bit of help with the mathematics. The projectile's motion in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is modeled as the solutions to the following initial value problems (taking advantage of the fact that motion along one axis is independent of the others). The coordinate system is rotated so that y points ""upward"" (against the direction of gravity), and x and z point ""horizontally"". It is still right-handed. Sorry about the ASCII equations; I don't have enough reputation to post images. $x(0) = c_1$ $x'(0) = v \cos(Î¸)\cos(Ï†)$ $x''(t) = -0.01x'(t)$ $y(0) = c_3$ $y'(0) = v \sin(Ï†)$ $y''(t) = -0.03 + -0.01y'(t)$ $z(0) = c_2$ $z'(0) = v \sin(Î¸)\cos(Ï†)$ $z''(t) = -0.01x'(t)$ Î¸ (horizontal angle), Ï† (elevation angle), and v are the launch parameters, but I can only control the two angles. I have no problem solving these differential equations to derive the components of the projectile's velocity, but I have a moving target to contend with. Let's say X (t, Î¸, Ï†, v) is the projectile's position as a function of time with given launch parameters guaranteed to stay constant with respect to changing t. I also have Y (t) as the target's position as a function of time, which is differentiable. However, this function doesn't have a clean analytical solution because the moving person's acceleration is often not differentiable (as when trying to intercept someone jumping off a cliff -- his acceleration will be about -0.03 m/s^2 until he hits the ground, when it suddenly goes to 0). I know I can remove this discontinuity, but still I'm left with a piecewise function which is really hard to use. This made my second approach by modeling the relative positions, velocities, and accelerations with differential equations fail. I've also tried simplifying the x and z coordinates into just one coordinate, and modeling the projectile as traveling an arc within a plane; this works well since there's no wind, and I can hit any static target in range accurately. But this only calculates based on the target's position and essentially calculates a function Z(Ï†) that is the altitude of the projectile when it is either directly above or below the target. I then calculate the roots of Z by using Newton's method, getting the angle (sometimes two). I tried adapting the static method by calculating the time-of-flight of the projectile to the target's original position, using this to estimate the target's moved position, repeating for a few iterations, and then firing at the final moved position, but this method resulted in worse accuracy than simply spreading shots out around the static target. I think it diverged. Now I'm stuck. I can't figure out a numerical method to find the required launch parameters given the target's position Y (t) as a function of time and a function X (t, Î¸, Ï†, v) and their derivatives. Is there anything that gives a reasonable degree of accuracy (10% or so) without anything a modern Intel processor can't do in about 50ms? Edit I don't care when the time of impact happens; I just need the paths to intersect at a given time. I can calculate the target's position at any point in the near future (or in the past).","['physics', 'trigonometry', 'numerical-methods', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'projectile-motion']"
2339882,"If the roots of an equation are $a,b,c$ then find the equation having roots $\frac{1-a}{a},\frac{1-b}{b},\frac{1-c}{c}$.","Actually I have come to know a technique of solving this kind of problem but it's not exactly producing when used in a certain problem. Say we have an equation
$$2x^3+3x^2-x+1=0$$
the roots of this equation are $a,b,c$. If I were to find the equation having the roots $\frac{1}{2a}, \frac{1}{2b}$ and $\frac{1}{2c}$ then I can use the root co-efficient relations and use the rule of creating equations from roots.
This gives me the result : $$4x^3 + 2x^2 -3x -1 =0$$
A much much simpler way to solve this math is: if we pick that, $f(x)= 2x^3+3x^2-x+1$ and the values of $x$ are $a,b$ and $c$ then $f\left(\frac{1}{2x}\right)$ will denote an equation (if we just write $f\left(\frac{1}{2x}\right)=0$ ) which has the roots $\frac{1}{2a}, \frac{1}{2b}$ and $\frac{1}{2c}$. And this way the result also matches the result of my previous work. But now I face an equation
$$x^3+3x+1=0$$ and if the roots are $a,b,c$ then I have to find the equation with the roots $\frac{1-a}{a},\frac{1-b}{b},\frac{1-c}{c}$.

2339908,"If $\lim_{x\to c} f'(x)$ exists, does $f'(c)$ exist? [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : Question on differentiability of a continuous function (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Here's a problem on differentiability at a point and continuity of the derivative function at the same point. I'm stating the problem and presenting my solution to it. I'm not entirely confident on my solution (especially about interchanging the limits). So I'd greatly appreciate if someone checks the solution and tell me if there's any gap in my arguments. Thank you. The Problem : Let $f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ and is differentiable except possibly at $c \in (a,b)$. Assume that $\lim_{x \to c} f'(x)$ exists. Show that $f'(c)$ exists and $f'$ is continuous at $c$. My Approach : Given that $\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)$ exists, we can write
\begin{align}
\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)&=\lim_{x \to c} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\
&=\lim_{h \to 0} \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} ~~\text{[Since the double-limit exists]}\\
&=\lim_{h \to 0} \Big[\frac{1}{h} \cdot \lim_{x \to c}\big\{f(x+h)-f(x)\big\}\Big]\\
&=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h} ~~\text{[Since $f$ is continuous]}\\
\end{align}
Since $\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)$ exists, so does $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(c+h)-f(c)}{h},$ i.e. $f'(c)$. Clearly, $\lim_{x \to c}f'(x)=f'(c)$. Hence $f'$ is continuous at $c$. $~\blacksquare$ P.S. The problem is from an exercise consisting of Mean Value Theorem (MVT)-related problems. So it is highly likely that MVT should play a role here, which makes me suspect this is a comparatively simple, probably too-simple-to-be-correct solution.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'continuity', 'proof-verification']"

2340017,A curve with arc length equal to the elliptic integral of the **first** kind. What's the area?,"A new curve whose arc length is given by the elliptic integral of the first kind has been developed. I'm seeking help in determining properties beyond the arc length. The roles of the elliptic integrals in the analysis of ellipses are well established and will not be repeated here. The basic results are that the average radius and the arc length of the elliptic curve for $\theta\in[0,\pi/2]$ are given by the elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, respectively. Specifically, $$
{\overline r}=\frac{2a}{\pi}~\text{K}(-A)\\
s=b~\text{E}(-A)\\
A=\frac{a^2-b^2}{b^2}
$$ where $a,b$ are the semi-major and -minor axes. We wondered if the there is a curve whose arc length is given by the elliptic integral of the first kind. To that end, we consider the arc length in the complex plane and reverse-engineered it to get the curve we want. $$
s=\int |\dot z(u)| du\\
\text{K}(k^2)=\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2\theta}}\\
|\dot z(u)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a^2\sin^2\theta}}\\
\dot z(u)=\frac{1}{1-ai\sin\theta}\\
z=\frac{2}{\sqrt{1+a^2}}\tan^{-1}\left[\frac{ai+\tan\frac{\theta}{2}}{\sqrt{1+a^2}} \right]
$$ I'll confess to using Mathematica to get indefinite integral, but I did verify its derivative manually. This is a single-parameter family of sigmoidal curves for $\theta\in[0,\pi]$ that can form closed curves when continued into the remaining quadrants. The arc length of the sigmoidal curve is $s=2\text{K}(-a^2)$. This result has been verified numerically, as well. Some example closed curves are shown below. The top figure shows random solutions for $a<\sqrt{2}$ and $a>\sqrt{2}$ on the left and right respectively. Those on the left overlap, those on the right do not. The lower figure demonstrates that these curves tessellate. So finally, the outstanding questions are: (1) The solution for $z$ seems to be intractable; it is important to simplify it if we are to have any chance of finding the area under the curve or its centroid. These will allow us to get at the bodies of revolution, as well. The problem is here is that these depend on the product $z^*\dot z$. The centroid of the curve itself is probably at its center point due to its symmetry. (2) A proper formula for extending the equation all the way around to a closed form is needed, in much the same way as the following equation describes a complete ellipse. $$z=a\cos\theta~\text{sign}(\cos\theta)+b\sin\theta~\text{sign}(\sin\theta),\quad \theta\in[0,2\pi]$$ (3) The significance of $a=\sqrt{2}$, which, by the way, is empirical, and may only be approximate. What I've tried so far: I can express $z(\theta)$ in terms of a logarithm instead of the arctangnet (by way of the arc hyperbolic tangent), but that does not improve matters. Here it is $$z=-\frac{i}{\sqrt{1+a^2}}\log\left[\frac{\sqrt{1+a^2}-a+i\tan\frac{\theta}{2}}{\sqrt{1+a^2}+a-i\tan\frac{\theta}{2}} \right]$$ Clearly, we express the tangent as sine and cosine, or exponentials, but it just gets worse and worse.","['special-functions', 'complex-analysis', 'elliptic-curves', 'elliptic-integrals']"

2340027,"Short exact sequence of topological groups which is split, but not topologically split","Consider an exact sequence of locally compact groups 
$$1 \to A \overset{\iota}{\to} B \overset{\pi}{\to} C \to 1.$$ Naturally, I assume the homomorphisms are continuous. I should probably also assume that $\pi$ is a quotient map, in the topological sense, but let's leave this assumption out for now. Now, suppose that there exists a homomorphism 
$$r : B \to A$$ such that $r \circ \iota = \mathrm{id}_A$. Then, $b \mapsto (r(b), \pi(b))$ is a continuous, bijective homomorphism $B \to A \times C$. In reasonable situations, one expects  the inverse map $A \times C \to B$ to be continuous so  that $B \cong A \times C$ as topological groups. Let us say that the sequence is topologically split if this holds. If the sequence, is topologically split, then there is a continuous homomorphism $s :C \to B$ such that $\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}_C$. So, clearly a necessary condition for the sequence to be topologically split is $\mathbf{(*)}$ There exists an open neighbourhood $U$ of $1$ in $C$ and a continuous function  $s: U \to B$ (not assumed compatible with multiplicaiton!) with $s(1) = 1$ such that $\pi \circ s = \mathrm{id}_U$. On the other hand, if $(*)$ holds, then $B$ is topologically split. Indeed, it suffices to check continuity of the inverse mapping $A \times C \to B$ on the neighbourhood $A \times U$ of $(1,1) \in A \times C$ and, in that neighbourhood, the inverse is given by the formula $(a,c) \mapsto \iota(a) s(c) \iota(r(s(c)))^{-1}$, whence is continuous. So, we have Proposition: Consider an exact sequence of locally compact groups $1 \to A \overset{\iota}{\to} B \overset{\pi}{\to} C \to 1$ and suppose there is a (continuous) homomorphism $r : B \to A$ with $r \circ \iota = \mathrm{id}_A$. Then, the sequence is topologically split if and only if $(*)$ holds i.e. if and only if $\pi$ admits a continuous section, defined on a neighbourhood of $1 \in C$. My question is as follows: Question: Can someone think of an example where there is a continuous, retracting morphism $r : B \to A$, but the sequence is not topologically split? Equivalently, by the above proposition, we need to take an example where $B$ is a not a locally trivial $A$-bundle over $C$. There are easy examples of this phenomenon: Take $A = \{\pm 1\}^\mathbb{N}$, the infinite product of 2-element groups (a Cantor set); $B = C =\mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N}$, the infinite product of the circle group; $\iota$ the evident inclusionl and $\pi$ the entrywise squaring map. This gives a short exact sequence
$$1 \to  \{\pm 1\}^\mathbb{N} \overset{\iota}{\to} \mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N} \overset{(z_i) \mapsto (z_i^2)}{\to} \mathbb{T}^\mathbb{N} \to 1$$
where $B$ is not an $A$-bundle over $C$, because $A$ is not locally-connected, and $B$ is. This example does not help with the question, because there is not retraction $B \to A$, but it does show that the condition $(*)$ is not automatic. The point is to show $(*)$ is still not automatic, even if there is a retraction $B \to A$.","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples', 'fibre-product', 'topological-groups']"

Let $\phi(t) \in C^2(\Bbb R, \Bbb C)$; that is, $\phi(t)$ is a twice continuously differentialble complex valued function on the real line $\Bbb R$.  Assume that $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vert \phi(t) \vert = 0, \tag{1}$ and $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vert \ddot \phi(t) \vert \to 0 \tag{2}$ as well.  Then must we also have $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vert \dot \phi(t) \vert \to 0? \tag{3}$ An answer to the above question as such would be most appreciated.  There are, however, two more restricted questions the answers to which would suffice for my purposes: I.) Suppose instead of (2) we assume the existence of a globally bounded, non-negative real function $b: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R_{\ge 0}$ such that $\vert \ddot \phi(t) \vert \le b(t) \vert \phi(t) \vert \tag{4}$ for sufficiently large $t$.  Is this hypothesis, in concert with (1), sufficient to force (3)?  Readers should feel free to add various hypotheses on $b(t)$ if they desire, such as $b(t) \in C^k(\Bbb R, \Bbb R_{\ge 0})$ for some $k\ge 0$, or that $b(t)$ exhibits some specific functional behavior, e.g. $b(t) = e^{-t}$ for sufficiently large $t$. I am particularly interested in the case $b(t) = B > 0$ a constant, so that $\vert \ddot \phi(t) \vert \le B \vert \phi(t) \vert. \tag{5}$ 2.) Suppose $c(t) \in C^k(\Bbb R, \Bbb C)$, $\Vert c(t) \Vert_k < \infty$, and $\ddot \phi(t) + c(t)\phi(t) = 0; \tag{6}$ then the hypothesis $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vert \phi(t) \vert \to 0$ clearly implies (2); can we now show $\lim_{t \to \infty} \vert \dot \phi(t) \vert \to 0$? Of particular interest to me is the case $k = 0$, that is, $c(t):\Bbb R \to \Bbb C$ is a bounded, continuous function. It is clear that these questions are, more or less, in order of decreasing generality: (2) is a case of (1) , itself a case of most widely scoped question stated at the beginning. My own efforts on this problem focused primarily on case (2.) and equation (6).  I looked a several things; for instance, (6) implies $\dot \phi \ddot \phi(t) + c(t)\phi(t) \dot \phi(t) = 0, \tag{7}$ or $\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{d(\dot \phi(t))^2}{dt} + c(t) \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{d (\phi(t))^2}{dt} = 0 \tag{8}$ or $\dfrac{d(\dot \phi(t))^2}{dt} + c(t)\dfrac{d (\phi(t))^2}{dt} = 0, \tag{9}$ which leads to an integral relationship $( (\dot \phi(t))^2 - (\dot \phi(t_0))^2 + \displaystyle \int_{t_0}^t c(s)\dfrac{d (\phi(s))^2}{ds} = E, \tag{10}$ a constant.  I think perhaps (10) might be used to show $\dot \phi(t)$ becomes small for large $t$, since $\phi(t)$ does; but I haven't found a conclusive argument along these lines as of this writing. I also tried looking at (1) and (2) directly, hoping to show that if $\ddot \phi(t)$ became very small, so that $\dot \phi(t)$ couldn't change too much, it ($\dot \phi$) would have to remain relatively small, lest $\phi(t)$ itself grow in a way not permitted by (1); but these are at the present more intuitive speculations rather than rigorous results. I'm hoping someone can help me fill in the gaps . . . any insights offered will be seriously considered and appreciated, whether or not they provide a complete solution.","['real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2340044,"In combinatorics, how can one verify that one has counted correctly?","This is a soft question, but I've tried to be specific about my concerns. When studying basic combinatorics, I was struck by the fact that it seems hard to verify if one has counted correctly. It's easiest to explain with an example, so I'll give one (it's fun!) and then pose my questions at the bottom. In this example there are two ways to count the number of ways $2n$ people can be placed into $n$ partnerships (from the book Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang): $$\frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!} = (2n - 1)(2n - 3) \cdots 3 \cdot 1$$ Story proof for the right side: For the first person you have $(2n - 1)$ choices for partner. Then for the next person you have $(2n - 3)$ choices, etc. Story proof for the left side: Line all $2n$ people up, walk down the line, and select every 2 people as a pair. The ordering you chose for the line determines the pairs, and there are $2n!$ ways to order $2n$ people. But divide by $2^n$ because the order within each pairing doesn't matter. Also divide by $n!$ because the order of the pairings doesn't matter. My question is: What if I had been tasked with getting this number at work, and I chose the approach on the left side, but I neglected to divide by $2^n$ and only divided by $n!$? I'd be wrong of course, but how could I have known? I suppose one answer to my question could just be ""Try hard, try to think of ways you might be over/undercounting, look at other examples, and continue to study theory."" But the prospect of not knowing if I'm wrong makes me nervous. So I'm looking for more concrete things I can do. So, three questions of increasing rigor: What are specific ""habits of mind"" that people in combinatorics use to avoid error? What are specific validation techniques that such people use to check their work?

On a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, coordinate functions $(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ are called isothermal if the metric is locally conformal to the Euclidean metric in these coordinates, that is, if $g$ is locally of the shape $d s^2 = \lambda(x_1, \dots, x_n) (d x_1^2 + \dots + d x_n^2)$ for some $\lambda(x_1, \dots, x_n) > 0$. Firstly, Deturck and Kazdan prove that on any Riemannian manifold, harmonic coordinate functions (where the Lacplace operator of the function is $= 0$) exist everywhere locally. Now to prove the existence of isothermal coordinates in the $2$-dimensional case, this allows to choose a harmonic function $u$ with non-vanishing derivative as the first component. So far I can follow. Now in the next step, they choose the second coordinate function $v$ using the Hodge star operator $\star$. Since $d u$ is a $1$-form and the Hodge star sends $1$-forms to $1$-forms, $\star d u $ is also a $1$-form. Now because $\star du$ is closed, the PoincarÃ© lemma ensures the existence of a coordinate function $v$ satisfying $d v = \star du$. Finally, they show that $v$ is also harmonic through a simple calculation. Now my question is: how can I see that these coordinate functions $(u, v)$ constructed this way are actually isothermal? Deturck and Kazdan don't seem to elaborate on that unless I have missed it somewhere, so maybe it's very easy and just I'm missing something trivial, but I've been trying to wrap my head around why the off-diagonal entries of the metric become $= 0$ when representing it with respect to these coordinate functions.

2340204,Power Reduction applied to Double Angles: $\cos^{2}(2\theta) = \frac{1+\cos(2(2\theta))}{2}$?,"I searched extensively for an answer, but couldn't find one that specifically explained what I was looking for.

$$ I don't get this step though. The power reduction equations are easy enough to understand, but the book does not explain how they apply to multiples of angles. The double angle identities don't really help either since they turn the trig functions into squares again. Why does applying power reduction on a squared double angle function quadruple the angle?

2340216,Bathroom floor tiles,"Recently I was looking at the tiles on my bathroom floor.  They are small square tiles about a square cm each arranged in a grid.  They come in two colors, the majority of them are a light brown while a select few of them are a darker brown.  Since the color scheme of my bathroom is pretty awful we'll just call them black and white (with white being the more abundant color). While I was looking at the tiles I was looking for four tiles that formed a the points of a parallelogram.  To my dismay there were none (I spent much more time than I care to admit verifying this fact).  So I started a new game, I would try to see what tiles I could make black without disturbing this property.  Soon I began to wonder how many tiles I could could be black in my bathroom while maintaining this property.  I found this a pretty daunting task because there quite a few tiles in my bathroom, so I downsized.  First I worked it out with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 bathrooms.  These were pretty easy you can fit 1 tile in a 1 by 1 and 3 in a 2 by 2. 3 by 3 is a little more difficult I was able to determine 5 tiles could be fit. Proof: Let us for a moment just consider the following parallelograms: (the parallelograms with corners in the top and bottom row) This will require at least 2 white tiles in these rows to break all of these parallelograms, and unless there are more than 2 we need one in the center column.
We can make an identical argument for the first and last columns , meaning that we need at least 3 white tiles in the outer ring (corners can be shared between the columns and row but centers cannot). Originally I made a more complex argument involving a lot of the parallelograms here, but I think it is a little more appropriate to brute force it from here. Here are all the ways that we can have three white tiles that satisfy the properties stipulated above: I have shaded the parallelograms that can be made from black tiles in red.  As we can see all 3 of the possibilities fail. Since none of these pass we know that there are at least 4 white tiles.  Luckily for us I found some solutions with 4 white tiles that do work so we can stop here: This proof does not scale up to 4 or larger squares very well or at all.  It feels barely more elegant brute forcing the problem and I fear that it would take me hours to come up with a proof on a 4 by 4. As Rahul pointed out and Jaap Scherphuis expanded upon we can create a lower bound for the number of black tiles that can fit on the floor at $2n-1$ (or $m+n-1$ for rectangular floors) by filling in two of the edges.  Jaap was kind enough to do a programatic search and found that this lower bound is optimal up to $7\times 7$, however no one has yet proven that $2n-1$ is the best for all squares. What methods might I use to solve larger or general cases of this problem? Is the lower bound always the best way?",['geometry']

2340445,"Prob. 10, Sec. 3.5, in Kreyszig's Functional Analysis: How to show that this set is at most countable?","This is Prob. 10, Sec. 3.5, in the book Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications by Erwine Kreyszig: Let $X$ be an inner product space, let $M$ be an uncountable orthonormal subset of $X$, let $x \in X$ such that $x$ is not the zero vector $\mathbf{0}_X$ in $X$, and let $S(x)$ be the subset of $M$ defined as follows: 
  $$ S(x) \colon= \left\{ \ v \in M \ \colon \ \langle x, v \rangle \neq 0 \ \right\}. $$
  Then how to show that this set $S(x)$ is at most countable? And, this is Prob. 8, Sec. 3.4, in the same book: Let $\left( e_k \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N} }$ be an orthonormal sequence in an inner product space $X$, let $x \in X$, let $m \in \mathbb{N}$, let $A_m(x)$ be the subset of $\mathbb{N}$ defined as follows: 
  $$ A_m(x) \colon= \left\{ \ k \in \mathbb{N} \ \colon \ \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert > \frac{1}{m} \ \right\}, $$
  and let $n_m$ be the cardinality of $A_m(x)$. Then 
  $$ n_m \leq m^2 \lVert x \rVert^2. $$ The proof of this result involves the Bessel's inequality and goes as follows: As $\left( e_k \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is an orthonormal sequence in the inner product space $X$, so by Theorem 3.4-6 (Bessel Inequality) in Kreyszig, for any $x \in X$, the series $\sum \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2$ converges in $\mathbb{R}$, and
  $$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 \leq \lVert x \rVert^2. $$ Let $x\in X$, let $m$ be a given natural number, and let $A_m(x)$ be ths subset of $\mathbb{N}$ given by
  $$ A_m(x) \colon= \left\{ \  k \in \mathbb{N}  \ \colon \ \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert > \frac{1}{m} \ \right\}. $$ Let $n_m$ denote the cardinality of the set  $A_m(x)$ (which is the same as  the number of elements in the set $A_m(x)$ if $A_m(x)$ is finite ),  where
  $$n_m \in \{ \ 0 \ \} \cup \mathbb{N} \cup \{ \ \aleph_0  \ \},$$
  where $\aleph_0$ (pronounced ``aleph null'') denotes the cardinality of the set $\mathbb{N}$ of natural numbers,
   because the set $A_m(x)$ can be empty, non-empty but finite, or countably infinite. Furthermore, as $A_m(x) \subset \mathbb{N}$ and as $\mathbb{N}$ is countable, so $A_m(x)$ cannot be uncountable. If $x = \mathbf{0}_X$, the zero vector in $X$, then
  $$ \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle = 0 $$
  for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and so the set $A_m(x)$ is empty, and therefore
  $$ n_m = 0 = m^2 \cdot 0 =  m^2 \lVert x \rVert^2. $$ So let's suppose that $x$ is not the zero vector in $X$, and suppose also that $n_m \geq m^2 \lVert x \rVert^2$. Then as
  $$ \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 \geq 0 $$
  for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and as
  $$ \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 > \frac{1}{m^2} $$
  for all $k \in A_m(x)$, so we note that
  \begin{align*}
 \sum_{k=1}^\infty  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 &= \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N} }  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 \\
 &= \sum_{k \in A_m(x) }  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 + \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N} - A_m(x)  }  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 \\
 &\geq \sum_{k \in A_m(x) }  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 \\\
 &> \frac{n_m}{m^2} \\
 &\geq \frac{m^2 \lVert x \rVert^2 }{m^2} \\
 &=  \lVert x \rVert^2,
\end{align*}
  which contradicts the Bessel's inequality. Hence we must have
  $$ n_m < m^2 \lVert x \rVert^2, $$
  as required. In the above calculation, we have used the equality
  $$  \sum_{k=1}^\infty  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2 = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N} }  \left\lvert \left\langle x, e_k \right\rangle \right\rvert^2. $$

Indeed, with reference to the picture at the bottom, we can see that we must have $$\theta = \frac{2 \pi} n = 2 \arctan \left( \frac r {\sqrt{R^2+2 R r}} \right)$$ from which $$n = \left \lfloor \frac \pi {\arctan \left( \frac r {\sqrt{R^2+2 R r}} \right)}\right \rfloor$$ The last expression gives the correct result for $R=r$, namely $n=6$ (hexagonal lattice).

2340664,"Is ${\varprojlim}^1 (\mathbb{Z}, \cdot n_k)$ torsion(free)?","Let $$\mathbb{Z} \xleftarrow{\cdot n_1} \mathbb{Z} \xleftarrow{\cdot n_2} \mathbb{Z} \xleftarrow{\cdot n_3} \cdots$$
be an inverse system with $n_i$ a natural number bigger 1.
Actually I'm trying to find out if the ${\varprojlim}^1$ term is not a torsion group, where ${\varprojlim}^1 (\mathbb{Z}, \cdot n_k)$ is defined as the cokernel of the map 
$$ \mu : \prod_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \prod_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z} \text{ , } (z_k)_k \longmapsto (z_k - n_k \cdot z_{k+1})_k \text{ .}$$
In the literature I found similiar examples saying it follows by an easy argument that ${\varprojlim}^1 (\mathbb{Z}, \cdot n_k)$ is torsionfree, but I don't seem to see it even after I worked on it for a while. My first idea was to take this inverse system into an exact sequence
$$ 0 \rightarrow \left(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot n_k \right) \rightarrow \left(\mathbb{Z}, \text{id} \right) \rightarrow \left( \mathbb{Z} \bigg/ \prod_{i=1} ^k n_i, \text{projections} \right) \rightarrow 0 $$
so by the long exact lim-lim$^1$ sequence the problem reduces to take a look at $\varprojlim \left(\mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1} ^k n_i \right) \bigg/ \mathbb{Z}$ where $\mathbb{Z}$ is canonically embedded in $\varprojlim \left(\mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1} ^k n_i \right)$ by taking a number $z$ to the sequence $(z)_k$. But also at this point I got stuck, so I tried working with the definition of ${\varprojlim}^1$ even so without any result. Has anybody a hint how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance. I've decoded the problem a little, so someone might have an idea for the important step (comments welcome).
As I mentioned above we have ${\varprojlim}^1 (\mathbb{Z}, \cdot n_k) \cong \varprojlim \mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i \bigg/ \mathbb{Z}$.
Every element in $\mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ is uniquely represented by an $0 \leq a_k < \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$, which we can uniquely write as $a_k = x_0 + x_1 n_1 + ... + x_{k-1} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} n_i$, where $ 0 \leq x_j < \prod_{i=1}^{j} n_i$. Since $\varprojlim \mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ is the kernel of the above map $\mu$ with $\prod_{k \in \mathbb{N}}\mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ instead of $\prod_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \mathbb{Z}$, we have $a_{k+1} \equiv a_k \text{ mod } \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, so $a_{k+1}$ has a (unique) representation $x_0 + x_1 n_1 + ... + x_{k-1} \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} n_i + x_k \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$. Then an element in $\varprojlim \mathbb{Z} \big/ \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Z}$ if $x_k \neq 0$ for infinitely many $k$ in the above representation. So let $a_k = x_0 + x_1 n_1 + ... + x_k \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i$ for every $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $z \in \mathbb{Z} \backslash \{0\}$. We like to show $([za_k])_k \notin \mathbb{Z}$. For every $k$ we have $$za_{k+1} = z (x_0 + ... + x_k \prod_{i=1}^{k} n_i) \equiv y_0 + ... + y_k \prod_{i=1}^k n_i \text{ mod } \prod_{i=1}^{k+1} n_i$$ for some $0 \leq y_j < \prod_{i=1}^j n_i$. (More precisely for each $x_m$ we can write $zx_m \equiv b_0 + ... + b_{m-1} \prod_{i=1}^{m-1} n_i \text{ mod } \prod_{i=1}^{m} n_i$ for $0 \leq b_j < \prod_{i=1}^j n_i$.) Now the question is if we can choose infintely many $x_j \neq 0$ such that there are infinitely many of those $y_j$ which are nonzero.","['abstract-algebra', 'homological-algebra', 'commutative-algebra']"

2340721,Theorem 2.20 in Friedberg's Linear Algebra,"Theorem 2.20 Let $V$ and $W$ be finite-dimensional vector spaces over $F$ of dimensions $n$ and $m$, respectively, and let $\beta$ and $\gamma$ be ordered bases for $V$ and $W$, respectively. Then the function $\phi : \mathcal{L}(V,W) \to M_{m \times n} (F)$, defined by $\phi(T) = [T]_\beta^\gamma$, is an isomorphism. In proving the theorem, the author merely shows that $\phi$ is linear and surjective. However, this seems to be fallacious. By just showing surjectivity, it seems that the author is implicitly relying on the finite dimensionality of $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ to conclude that it must also be injective. This is initially what I thought of doing when I tried proving theorem myself; I was going to use the rank-nullity theorem but then realized I do not have finite dimensionality. Instead, I chose to prove the two following two lemmas: First I proved that $v \in V \setminus \{0\}$ implies $[v]_\beta \neq 0$. Here is my proof: Let $\beta = \{v_1,...,v_n\}$. Since $v$ is not zero, there exist $a_1,...,a_n$ not all equal to zero such that $v = \sum a_i v_i$. By definition, $[v]_\beta = (a_1,...,a_n)^T$, which cannot be the zero vector in $F^n$, since not every entry is zero. Then I proved that $T \neq 0$ implies $[T]_\beta^\gamma \neq 0$. Here is my proof: Let $\gamma = \{w_1,...,w_m\}$ and suppose that $T \neq 0$. Then there exists a $v \in V \setminus \{0\}$ such that $T(v)\neq 0$. Hence $0 \neq [T(v)]_\gamma = [T]_\beta^\gamma [v]_\beta$. If $[T]_\beta^\gamma$ were zero, then we would have a contradiction. Hence, $[T]_\beta^\gamma \neq 0$ From this it follows that if $[T]_\beta^\gamma = 0$, then $T=0$, proving that the kernel of $\phi$ is trivial and therefore injective. Now, as far as I can tell, $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ being finite dimensional has not been demonstrated yet; in fact, the corollary of this theorem is that $dim (\mathcal{L}(V,W))$, which of course entails finite dimensionality. Thus, it seems that the proof is lacking since injectivity does not follow from what has been proven heretofore. To put it straightforwardly, how do the authors prove the theorem without explicitly showing injectivity?  Perhaps those with a copy of Friedberg might be able to answer the question. EDIT: As Li Chun Min points out, a crucial part of the proof is that there exists a unique linear operator $T : V \to W$ such that $$T(v_j) = \sum_{I=1}^m A_{ij} w_j,$$ which gives one surjectivity and injectivity.","['matrices', 'vector-space-isomorphism', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations']"
2340732,Relation between exclusive-OR and modular addition in a specific function,"I am trying to understand the relation between exclusive-OR (XOR) and modular addition in the function $f(x,a,b,c,d) = \bigg(\Big(\big((x \oplus a) \boxplus b\big) \oplus c\Big) \boxplus d\bigg)$ over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^n}$, where $\oplus$ denotes XOR and $\boxplus$ denotes addition modulo $2^n$. It seems that when $n=2$, for any value of $(a,b,c,d)$, I can find $31$ different $(a',b',c',d')$ such that $f(x,a,b,c,d) = f(x,a',b',c',d')$. I can explain it in the following way:
bits of different operands can be flipped to get the same result at the end. For example, let's consider $(a,b,c,d) = (3,3,1,0)$. If we flip the most significant bit of $a$ and the most significant bit of $b$ we get $(a',b',c',d') = (1,1,1,0)$ and $f(x,a,b,c,d) = f(x,a',b',c',d')$ for any $x$. There are four other combinations, which explains the number of solutions $2^5 = 32$. I get $96$ results for $n=3$, $256$ for $n=4$, etc...
My problem is the following: whereas some combinations remain the same regardless of the parameter $n$, it seems that operands' size impact the number of combinations. So my question is:  given $n$, and $(a,b,c,d)$ how can I find the set $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\mathcal{S} = \{(a',b',c',d') \in (\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})^4\space | \space f(x,a,b,c,d) = f(x,a',b',c',d') \space \forall x \in \mathbb{Z}_{2^n}\}$?","['finite-fields', 'binary', 'binary-operations', 'combinatorics', 'linear-algebra']"

2341089,Show that $\lim\inf A_n\subset \lim\sup_n A_n$,"Let $\{A_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ a family of subsets of a metric space

 \cup_{n=1}^\infty(\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_i)$$ Show that a) $\lim\inf A_n\subset \lim\sup_n A_n$ b) If $A_n\subset A_{n+1}$ $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}$ then $$\lim\inf_n
A_n=\lim\sup_n A_n=\cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$$ I followed some answers from here lim sup and lim inf of sequence of sets. and did a) If $x$ is a member of $\cup_{n=1}^\infty(\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_i)$ then $x$ is a member of at least one of $\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_i$ what means that $x$ is member of all except a finite number of $A_i$, so $x$ is member of $\cup_{i=n}^\infty A_i$ and consequently $x$ is a member of $\cap_{n=1}^\infty
 (\cup_{i=n}^\infty A_i)$ I'm not sure how to justify this, but it seems to me that something is missing. b) Since $A_n\subset A_{n+1}$ then $\forall x\in A_n\Rightarrow x\in A_{n+1}$. Then $\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_n=A_n$. Thus
$$\lim\inf_n A_n=\cup_{n=1}^\infty(\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_i)=\cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$$ I guess that I should proof that $$(1) \lim\inf_n A_n\subset \lim\sup A_n$$ and $$(2) \lim\sup_n A_n\subset \lim\inf_n A_n$$ But I'm stuck In (1) if $x$ is member of $\cup_{n=1}^\infty(\cap_{i=n}^\infty A_i)$ then $x\in \cup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$ But how I can justify that $x$ is member of $\lim\sup_n A_n$ too?","['real-analysis', 'metric-spaces', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2341094,Find the angle $\angle ACD=\theta$.,"Problem: Triangle $\triangle ABC$ has $AC=BC$ and $\angle ACB=96^{\text{o}}$. $D$ is a point in $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle DAB=18^{\text{o}}$ and $\angle DBA=30^{\text{o}}$. Compute $\angle ACD.$ Drawing the problem first: From the law of cosine we have that $b^2=2a^2-2a^2\cos{96}=2a^2(1-\cos{96})$ which leads to $b=|a|\sqrt{2(1-\cos{96})}.$ Since $\angle CAB=\angle ABC=(180-96)/2=42$, it follows that $\angle CAD=42-18=24$ and $\angle CBD = 42-30=12$. This information allows us to express $f$ in two ways by the law of cosine: \begin{array}{lcl}
f^2 & = & e^2+a^2+2ea\cos{12} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \quad \ \quad (1)\\
f^2 & = & d^2+a^2+2da\cos{24} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \quad \ \quad (2)\\

Subtracting (1)-(2) we get $e^2-d^2+2a(e\cos{12}-d\cos{24})=0$. Here I'm stuck. Any suggestion on how to proceed?",['geometry']

The way I approached this problem was to convert $\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{71}\right)$ into complex form using:
$$\sin(x)=\frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}$$
Substitute $\sin(x)$ with complex form and solve the series to finally deduce to:
$$\frac{71}{2^{2560}}\sum_{n=0}^{36}\left(-1\right)^n \begin{pmatrix} 2560\\71n+2\\\end{pmatrix}$$
This is where I finally stuck but I tried to use calculator with lower power of $\sin$ (i.e. $\sin^{50}\left(\frac{n\pi}{23}\right)$ or $\sin^{20}\left(\frac{n\pi}{71}\right)$) to calculate the alternative but similar version of the original summation to see how would the answer looks like, so far, the answer seems to be $$\frac{71}{2^{2560}}\begin{pmatrix} 2560\\1280\\\end{pmatrix}$$ though this have yet to be confirmed or proven. The summation I have got make it difficult to confirm the answer since it chooses very specific terms to compute i.e. every 71 terms and it is also alternating.

2341143,How many days are needed to cover at least half of all birthdays in a group of people?,"My question is related to this question . I am wondering if we have a large crowd of $2000$ people: what is the expected minimum number days of the year we have to pick in order for at least half of the birthdays of the crowd to be in one of those days? To be clear: with $2000$ people the average number of birthdays for any day is between $5$ and $6$, but there surely will be days where $10$ or even $12$ people have their birthday. So, knowing the birthdays of all people, I want to pick as many of those days, so that with as few days as possible I do cover half of the birthdays. That should be a good bit below $183$ I would think. In fact, my intuition is that for a crowd of $2000$, this would be $100$ or so, but I could be way off, so I would like to know. I also have the feeling that with a crowd of this size, we can make a fairly precise prediction as to how many days are needed. That is, if the expected number of days we need to cover at least $1000$ of the $2000$ birthdays is $100$, I would guess that the actual number of days with an actual crowd will be fairly close that that expected number. That is, I would like to have a result that says something like: There is a $95$% chance that the actual number of days lies within the interval $[X-Y,X+Y]$. I am just guessing: $X=100$ and $Y=5$ How far am I off? I welcome any kind of mathematical analysis, but I also welcome computer simulated approximations for this. And of course, while I am particularly interested in a crowd size of $2000$, feel free to provide a general answer in terms of $n$.","['birthday', 'statistics', 'probability', 'poisson-distribution']"
