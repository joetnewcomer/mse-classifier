943731,Show $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$ is dense and open in $\mathbb{R}$,"I was trying to prove the statement that 
$$\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \text{ is dense and open in $\mathbb{R}$}$$ 
Could someone help to read my proof and give me some feedbacks/corrections. Here is my try: OPENNESS: To show $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\} \text{ is open in $\mathbb{R}$}$ Take any point $x \in \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$, need to show there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal{B}{(x, \delta)}$ such that $\mathcal{B}{(x, \delta)} \subset \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$. Thus, let $\delta >0$ and an arbitrary point $y := x + \delta/2$ with $\delta >0$. Then observe that 
$$|x-y| = |x - (x + \delta/2)| < \delta$$ Thus, $y \in \mathcal{B}{(x, \delta)}$ and thus $y \in \mathbb{R}$. It implies $ \mathcal{B}{(x, \delta)} \subset \mathbb{R}$. Hence, $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$ is open. DENSITY: To show $\mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$; it is obvious to see the set is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ except at one point $0$. So we just only need to check the density at that point $x =0$. Thus, we show the point $0$ is a limit point of the set $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$. Let $\mathcal{B}(0,\delta)$ be any neighborhood of $0$, then take a point $\delta/2 \neq 0$ with any $\delta >0$. Then we can see that
$$
|\delta/2 -0 | < \delta
$$ so that $\delta/2 \in \mathcal{B}(0, \delta)$ and the point $\delta/2 >0$ which is contained in $\mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$.","['general-topology', 'calculus']"

943835,Central limits without replacement in a finite population.,"""Everybody knows"" that there are lots of variations on the theme of the central limit theorem.

My only other idea was to find the power series for $x^x$, which is $x^x=\sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty\frac{1}{i!}x^i\log^i(x)$ according to Wolfram Alpha , somehow prove I can swap series and integral after plugging that series into the integral, and compute each term, but the calculations are really ""crazy"" for the general term $\int\limits_{-\infty}^0\frac{x^i\log^i(x)}{i!(x^3-1)}\mathrm{d}x$. Note that $i$ is an index, not the imaginary unit. I have a hunch this may require some complex analysis, especially since $x^x$ is not really defined on those negative numbers, but is complexly . Since I can't go anywhere on my own, I thought I'd come here and ask: is there some smart and not overly calculation-y way to compute this? Edit: It does seem that the integral has a complex value. Here is the screenshot of the exercise: A a first glance I thought it was a Calculus exercise. Then $x^x$ is not defined for negative numbers, or at least, not for all of them. The integral seems to have a complex value as written. So this has become a really misterious exercise.

If $m = 3$ and the system is consistent, (equivalently, $\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space of $A$ ), then the columns of the augmented matrix $\pmatrix{ A \mid {\bf b}}$ are linearly dependent, and so $$\det \pmatrix{ A \mid {\bf b}} = 0.$$ In particular, we have produced a polynomial in the components $(a_{ij}, b_j)$ of the linear system for which vanishing is a necessary condition for system's consistency. I'll call such polynomials polynomial obstructions for the system. If $m > 3$ , then we can produce ${m}\choose{3}$ such polynomials by considering the determinants of the $3 \times 3$ minors of $\pmatrix{ A \mid {\bf b}}$ . Are essentially all polynomials obstructions to the system essentially given by these, or are there others?

If not, how does one produce a complete set of generators? More generally, for an $m \times n$ overdetermined linear system (so that $m > n$ ) $$A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b},$$ we can produce polynomial obstructions by taking the determinants of the ${m}\choose{n+1}$ minors (of size $(n + 1) \times (n + 1)$ ).

The chapter where that is introduced comes much later.  Therefore I would not have access to that knowledge directly. I am very confused by the wording of this question from Kenneth Rosen's Discrete Mathematics 6th Edition . p. 346 problem 40 In how many ways can a photographer at a wedding arrange 6 people in a row from a group of 10 people, where the bride and the groom are
  among these 10 people, if a) the bride must be in the picture? b) both the bride and the groom must be in the picture? c) exactly one of the bride and the groom is in the picture? This problem comes after chapter 5.1, which is an introduction to the basic principles of counting: product rule, sum rule, and inclusion-exclusion principle.  The chapter never deals with permutations or combinations (these terms are not even defined yet).  However, the answers to this question suggest that it is asking for permutations and not just combinations.  What wording of the question says I am looking for permutations and not combinations ? For example, to solve part a), I calculated all the (unique) combinations of 6 people from a group of 10 where 1 is always the bride.  This comes to $1 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 15,120$.  But the number of permutations is actually $6 \times 15120 = 90720$, since for each combination the bride has 6 possible positions.  This sort of makes sense. The same reasoning is used to solve b) (permutations again), which comes to $1 \times 1 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 = 1,680$ combinations times $6 * 5$ ways to permute each combination, so the answer is $30 * 1680 = 50,400$. However , part c) is incredibly confusing because the answers I have found seem to just use combinations, and not permutations.  Assuming my reasoning is correct in both a) and b), the number of combinations of 6 people from a group of 10 where either the bride or the groom (but not both) is chosen is just $1 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 40,320$ for the bride and for the groom.  However, this is just combinations, and not permutations to my understanding, because there are 6 ways to arrange either the bride or groom for each such combination.  Yet, the answers I have found simply add both combinations together: $40320 + 40320  = 80,640$.  If we were considering permutations, would it not need to be $[6 * 40320] + [6 * 40320] = 483,840$ permutations? So my question is, why is the solution to part c) asking only for combinations, where as a) and b) both ask for permutations, when the scope of the question never changed ( arrange still has scope over part c)). I am confused overall by this question as well, since the author never introduced any permutations in chapter 5.1 and these are the exercises for 5.1.","['permutations', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinations']"

944879,"Possible to figure out whose go it is in checkers game, based purely on the position of pieces on the board?","I came across a checkers board in my house with an unfinished game on it which made me wonder if it possible, just by looking at the positions of the pieces on the board, whose go it is next. For example, this is impossible in chess (I.e. There are plenty of positions which come to mind where it is impossible to determine who goes next.)I was wondering if it is the same for checkers. I feel that it should be determinable but I'm not sure. I tried to prove it by numbering the rows of the checkers board and assigning values to each piece based on the row the piece is in, and created a semi-successful system where different positions could be described as even or odd, each indicating a different player to move next. That said, the system failed to work in some situations (capturing wasn't properly accounted for). Of course, if someone can come up with a counter example, that would solve the problem.

\end{align} We have the following explicit formula for the Hermite polynomials: for
all $m$ and $x\in\mathbb{R}$ \begin{align*}
	H_m(x)=m!\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor m/2\rfloor}\frac{(-1)^k}{k!(m-2k)!2^k}
		x^{m-2k}.
\end{align*} By $(1)$ for all $m=2l+1$ with some $l\geq 1$ we can calculate \begin{align*}
	a_m&:=\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{E} \mathrm{sgn}(X)H_m(X)=
		\frac{(2l+1)!}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^l
		\frac{(-1)^k}{k!(2l-2k+1)!2^k}2^{l-k+1/2}\Gamma(l-k+1)\\
		&=\frac{(2l+1)!2^l}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\sum_{k=0}^l
		\frac{(-1)^k(l-k)!}{k!(2l-2k+1)!4^k}.
\end{align*} On the other hand for any $\varepsilon>0$ \begin{align}
	\sqrt{2\pi}a_m&=\int_0^{\infty}\mathrm{sgn}(x)H_m(x)
		\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}dx\\

		\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}\right)\bigg|^{\infty}_{\varepsilon}.\quad(2)
\end{align} Now \begin{align*}
	\left(\frac{d^{m-1}}{dx^{m-1}}

		(-1)^{m-1}\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}H_{m-1}(x)\bigg|^{\infty}_{\varepsilon}=
		(-1)^m\mathrm{e}^{-\frac{\varepsilon^2}{2}}H_{m-1}(\varepsilon).
\end{align*} Since the integrand in $(2)$ is bounded on $[0,\varepsilon]$ (e.g. here ) and $\varepsilon$ is arbitrary we conclude that \begin{align*}
	\sqrt{2\pi}a_m=H_{m-1}(0)=(-1)^{(m-1)/2}(m-2)!!
\end{align*} and thus the desired identity holds for all $l\geq 1$ .","['factorial', 'summation', 'combinatorics']"
945621,Geometry question: ray paths and circles,"I was working on a problem and used the image below to make an argument regarding an effective line-of-sight (from one of my papers).  My question below is more of an intellectual curiosity since the paper was already published (I am a physicist, so if my mathematical lingo is sloppy, I will entertain criticism if witty). Suppose one moved along either of the red arrows (or equally the obstacle moved over you) at a velocity $\mathbf{V}_{o}$, then we could say that $L_{s}$ = $\lvert \mathbf{V}_{o} \rvert t$.  Using some simple geometric rules, we can also show that:
$$
L_{s} = 2 \left( a^{2} - b^{2} \right)^{1/2}
$$
where $a$ is the radius of the circle and $b$ is the impact parameter (see figure).  I was also able to find an analytic solution for $L_{a}$ = $L_{a}\left( L_{s},a,\theta \right)$ for the top trajectory, given by:
$$
L_{a} = -\frac{ L_{s} }{ 2 } \pm \frac{ \left\{ \left[ 2 \ a \ \cos \theta + \sqrt{4 \ a^{2} - L_{s}^{2} } \right]^{2} + L_{s}^{2} \sin^{2} \theta \right\}^{1/2} }{ 2 \sin \theta }
$$
This is the length of the trajectory over which one would be in the effective ""shadow"" of this obstacle (don't worry about what SLAMS stands for… unless you are interested in nonlinear solitons). However, this solution only works for the top trajectory.  Therefore, I have two questions: Is there an analytic solution for the lower trajectory? If so, how would I go about finding it [I used power of point etc. for the top part but couldn't convince myself it would work for the bottom part]? Edits In the figure below, you see two red arrows.  These correspond to two possible trajectories through the obstacle.  One could imagine sitting still while the obstacle moved over you at a velocity $\mathbf{V}_{o}$ (or you move through the obstacle at that velocity, it doesn't matter).  Therefore, $L_{s}$ is the distance traversed while inside the obstacle. The distance $L_{a}$ shown in blue is the distance between the point of exit from the obstacle to the point where the green arrows no longer intersect with the obstacle.  Meaning, $L_{a}$ defines the distance along the red arrow one must traverse before one can observe something along a green arrow line of sight that does not intersect the obstacle. In the current figure, the $L_{a}$ is only shown for the top trajectory.  The corresponding $L_{a}$ for the bottom trajectory with this specific $\theta$ and $b$ would be very short (actually, just to the right of the blue vertical dashed line is where it would end and just to the left is where it would start).","['geometry', 'trigonometry', 'circles']"
945635,How can I determine the number of wedge products of $1$-forms needed to express a $k$-form as a sum of such?,"This question was motivated by this related one: How ""far"" a differential form is from an exterior product . Let $\mathbb{V}$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ with underlying field $\mathbb{F}$, and say (for lack of a better term) that the wedge rank of a $k$-form $$\phi \in \Lambda^k \mathbb{V}^*$$ is the minimum number $r$ for which there are exist wedge products $v_a^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_a^k$, $a = 1, \ldots, r$, of $1$-forms $v_a^b \in \mathbb{V}^*$, $b = 1, \ldots, k$, such that
$$\phi = \sum_{a = 1}^r v_a^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_a^k.$$
(For convenience, we can declare the empty sum to have value the $0$ k-form, so that the wedge rank of $0$ is $0$.) In general, given  $\phi$, what is an effective way to determine its wedge rank $r$? We can make a few obvious remarks: First, $r \leq \dim \Lambda^k \mathbb{V}^* = {{n}\choose{k}}$, but in general it is much smaller, and anyway for nonzero $0$-, $1$- and $n$-forms, $r = 1$, and exploiting the natural isomorphism $\Lambda^{n - 1} \mathbb{V}^* \cong \mathbb{V} \otimes \Lambda^n \mathbb{V}^*$ gives that the same applies to nonzero $(n - 1)$-forms. For $k = 2$, a $2$-form $\phi$ has wedge rank $1$ (that is, it is decomposable) iff $\phi \wedge \phi = 0$, and we can exploit the isomorphism $\Lambda^{n - 2} \mathbb{V}^* \cong \Lambda^2 \mathbb{V} \otimes \Lambda^n \mathbb{V}^*$ to make an analogous statement about the $k = n - 2$ case. Furthermore, if $n$ is even, the wedge rank of $\phi$ is exactly $r$ iff $$\underbrace{\phi \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi}_r \neq 0 \qquad \text{but} \qquad \underbrace{\phi \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi}_{r + 1} = 0.$$
(Perhaps something similar holds for odd $n$?) In higher tensor ranks, the story quickly becomes more complicated. For example, if $\dim \mathbb{V} = 7$ (and $\mathbb{F}$ perfect and $\text{char } \mathbb{F} \neq 2$), the tensor rank of a $3$-form $\phi$ is at most $5$ (this already seems nonobvious). It turns out (at least over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$) that $r = 5$ iff the $\Lambda^7 \mathbb{V}^*$-valued bilinear form $$(X, Y) \mapsto (i_X \phi) \wedge (i_Y \phi) \wedge \phi$$ is nondegenerate, but the rank of the bilinear form does not determine $r$ for all smaller values of $r$. Anyway, this particular property seems essentially unique to this $(n, k)$. There's a further complication, namely that the wedge rank of a $k$-form need not remain the same under extension of the base field. This phenomenon already shows up in the smallest-dimensional case not covered by the above considerations: If $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{R}$ and $\dim \Bbb V = 6$, there is a $3$-form whose stabilizer under the pullback action of $GL(\mathbb{V}) \cong GL(6, \mathbb{R})$ on $\Lambda^3 \mathbb{V}^*$ is exactly $SU(3)$, and any such $3$-form has wedge rank $4$ (in fact, there is a single $GL(\Bbb V)$-orbit of such $3$-forms, and it is open). When viewed as an element of the complex vector space $\mathbb{V} \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C}$, however, any such $3$-form has wedge rank $2$. So, the structure of the underlying field $\mathbb{F}$ plays a (to me) subtle role, and quite possibly it turns out this question is easier to answer over algebraically closed fields.","['tensors', 'linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra']"

My attempt: $E(X;G)$ and $E(Y;G)$ are finite measures that agree on a pi-system. They are finite because you can plug in $\Omega$ in each and say the output is finite X $\in L^1 (\Omega, \mathscr{F}, P)$ and Y $\in L^1 (\Omega, \mathscr{G}, P)$ and $\Omega \subseteq \mathscr{I} \subseteq \sigma(\mathscr{I}) = \mathscr{G} \subseteq \mathscr{F}$. Thus by uniqueness lemma, they agree on the sigma-algebra generated by the Pi-System. QED...? Is this right?

The mean vector $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ is given (no need to compute it by the available samples). We want to compute the covariance matrix $\Sigma$. By definition,
$$
\Sigma = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N (\mathbf{x}_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})(\mathbf{x}_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^\top,

but what is the case when $N\ll n$? For instance, let the dimensionality of $\mathbf{x}$ be $n=1000$ and suppose that we have solely $N=10$ observations of it. I think that because of the so-called ""curse of dimensionality"" we cannot find a sufficient estimation of $\Sigma$. Is that true? Finally, could we have some better estimation given that $\Sigma=\sigma I_n$? That is, does it help if we require to find just one parameter ($\sigma$), not the full covariance matrix? EDIT I: What I have tried so far is to find that $\sigma^\star$ which minimizes the Frobenius norm of $\Sigma-\sigma I_n$:
$$
\sigma^\star = \underset{\sigma} {\mathrm{argmin}} \left\| \Sigma - \sigma I_n \right\|_F^2,
$$
and thus
$$
\sigma^\star = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{ii}.

Does it make sense? Thanks a lot! EDIT II: The above approach seems to produce meaningful covariance matrices (are they trully meaningful?), but it does not work in practice.
