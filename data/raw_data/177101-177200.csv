3189993,Do 50% of people die on either side of an average life expectancy?,"I am no statistician so this may come across as very naive, but I've been trying to get my head around how to interpret life expectancy data. Say you have a population of $n$ and a range of possible ages from 0â€“ $m$ . Am I right in thinking that given an average life expectancy of $x$ years, roughly 50% of the population must fall on either side of that line (ignoring those who fall directly on it)? As such, given an average life expectancy of 75, a maximum age of 120 and a population of 10,000, 5,000 (ish) would be expected to die between the ages of 0 and 74 and 5,000 (ish) between 76 and 110? And that that second half will be more densely packed than the first half (as it covers 34 years rather than 74 with the same number of people)? Finally, if the above is broadly correct (and if we assume for simplicity's sake that each age has an equal likelihood of fatality), does that mean you are more likely to die on the left side of the average until you make it halfway between 0 and $x$ , whereupon you are equally as likely to die on either side of the average, and each subsequent year survived increases your likelihood of outliving the average? My thinking being that if you have a $\frac{1}{120}$ chance of dying each year (0.83%), each year of the left side is $\frac{1}{74}$ (1.35%) whereas each year on the right side is $\frac{1}{34}$ , or ~ $\frac{2}{74}$ (2.94%).","['actuarial-science', 'statistics']"
3190012,Find the number of degree 1 vertices in terms of n and d,"Fix an integer $d>1$ . Let $G$ be a tree with $n$ vertices, and every vertex can have either degree $1$ or $d$ . Find the number of degree $1$ vertices in terms of $d$ and $n$ . 
I've been working on this problem and I feel like I almost have the answer. I worked out that if $d=2$ , the graph will just be a line with vertices and $2$ leaves, so there will be $2$ vertices with $\deg(1)$ , no matter how many vertices there actually are. If $d=3$ , $n$ starts to matter. Using the fact that the sum of all the $\deg(v)$ of a graph is $2|E|$ and that in a tree $|E|=|V|-1$ I worked out that the sum of $\deg(v)=2n-1$ , and that this sum mod $d$ will be the amount of degree $1$ vertices. ( Since $d+d+d+\dots+1+1+1+1$ mod $d$ will be the sum of the $1$ 's unless the sum is greater than $d$ , then it will wrap around). I'm having a hard time putting this all together into a simple equation. I don't want just the solution, I want to understand how to find the equation as well.","['trees', 'graph-theory', 'eulerian-path', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

3190070,"Is this proof of $H\le G, [G:H] =2 \implies a^2\in H \forall a\in G$ correct?","If $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$ and the index (number of right cosets) of $H$ is $2$ , then $a^2 \in H$ for all $a\in G$ . My attempt: if $a\in H$ then $a^2\in H$ directly. If $a\notin H$ and $a^2\notin H$ then $a(a^{-1})^{-1}  = a^2 \notin H$ then $G = Ha \cup Ha^{-1}$ (the union being disjoint). But $e\notin Ha$ because $e=a^{-1}a$ and $a^{-1}\notin H$ . Also $e\notin Ha^{-1}$ because $e = aa^{-1}$ and $a\notin H$ . Then we have a contradiction. So $a^2$ must be in $H$ in both cases.

3190075,Show that there is no simple group of order $3393$,"Show that there is no simple group of order $3393$ The hint I was given was to look at Sylow $3$ -subgroups. I know that $3393 = 3^2 \times 13 \times 29$ and that $G$ must contain a subgroup of order $3^2$ , say $H$ . But how can I proceed further with this. The proof I managed to come up with was this. Attempted Proof: Let $G$ be a simple group of order $3393$ . Sylow theory tells us that the number of Sylow $29$ subgroups of $G$ , $n_{29}$ is either $1$ or $117$ and that the number of Sylow $13$ subgroups of $G$ , $n_{13}$ is either $1$ or 260 $261$ . Since $G$ is simple we must have $n_{13} = 261$ and $n_{29} = 117$ . Let $\operatorname{Syl}_{29}(G) = \{H_i \ | 1 \leq i \leq 117\}$ , since $H_i \cap H_j \leq H_i$ for any $i \neq j$ we must have $H_i \cap H_j = \{1_G\}$ , for otherwise we'd end up with $H_i \cap H_j$ . This shows that we have at least $117 \times 28 = 3276$ elements of order $29$ in $G$ . Applying the same reasoning to $\operatorname{Syl}_{13}(G)$ we see that $G$ must also contain $261 \times 12 = 3132$ elements of order $13$ . Thus $|G| \geq 3132 + 3276 > 3393 = |G|$ a contradiction. $\square$ Are there any errors in my proof? If not, how can I use the hint to prove this?","['group-theory', 'proof-verification', 'finite-groups']"
3190078,Birth/Death Processes with constant departure rate,"So, I'm looking at a Birth/Death process $Z$ with an arrival rate of $\frac{1}{n+1}$ and a departure rate of $1$ . I'm trying to show that this process is positive recurrent and find the stationary distribution. My understanding of positive recurrent is that if there is a non-zero probability that the markov chain will not return to a state. Additionally, it is a class property, and there only seems to be one communication class as you can access every state from any other state. Since the departure rate is greater than 0, isn't there always a probability that the markov chain will return to any initial starting state? So, if we take state 1, there is always a non-zero probability that the markov chain will return back to state 1 as the departure rate is nonzero? I'm a bit confused on how to answer the question (and show that this chain is positive recurrent) since I don't agree with the assumption the question is making (that this process is positive recurrent). I'd appreciate any help! Thank you so much!","['stochastic-processes', 'statistics', 'probability']"
3190126,Finding particular solutions of $y^{(4)} + 2y'' + y = x \sin x$,"We have a non homogeneous ODE $$y^{(4)} + 2y'' + y = x \sin x$$ with characteristic equation I get $(l^2+1)^2 = 0$ so $l = -i ,i$ and so the answer of homogeneous ODE is a linear combination of $\sin x , \cos x , x \sin x , x\cos x$ . For finding the Particular solution first I assumed $y_p = (Ax+B)(C\sin x + D \cos x)$ and it didn't work. Then $y_p = x(Ax+B)(C\sin x + D \cos x)$ and it didn't work. At last, $y_p = x^2(Ax+B)(C\sin x + D \cos x)$ worked and the answer was $-1/24 x^3 \sin x -1/8 x^2 \cos x$ worked but it took a lot of time to find that the other two don't work. I want to know is there any way to guess the leading $x^n$ term and not testing different situations? (In this case $n=2$ ) I know it can be solved with a way involving Wronskian and Cramer's rule (but that way needs a 4x4 determinant which takes time to calculate) but I want to solve with undetermined coefficients rule so I want to find a better way for guessing the answer format.","['derivatives', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
3190151,How can we show that $\left\{x\mapsto\prod_{i=1}^kf_i(x_i):f_i\in C_0(E_i)\right\}$ is convergence determining on $\times_{i=1}^ kE_i$?,"Let $E$ be a complete locally compact separable metric space and $\mu,\mu_n$ be probability measures on $\mathcal B(E)$ . We say $\mu_n\to\mu$ weakly if $$\int f\:{\rm d}\mu_n\to\int f\:{\rm d}\mu\tag1$$ for all bounded continuous $f:E\to\mathbb R$ (write $f\in C_b(E)$ ) and we say $\mu_n\to\mu$ vaguely if $(1)$ for all compactly supported continuous $f:E\to\mathbb R$ (write $f\in C_c(E)$ ). By the Portmanteau theorem, $\mu_n\to\mu$ weakly if and only if $\mu_n\to\mu$ vaguely and $\mu(E)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu_n(E)$ . Now, we say that $M\subseteq C_b(E)$ is convergence determining if the assertion that $(1)$ holds for all $f\in M$ implies $\mu_n\to\mu$ weakly. By Proposition 4.4 of Chapter 3 in the book of Ethier/Kurtz, $C_c(E)$ is convergence determining. But that means (by our definition) $\mu_n\to\mu$ vaguely. Question 1 : Am I missing something or does that mean that in the Portmanteau theorem we are able to conclude $\mu_n\to\mu$ vaguely and $\mu(E)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu_n(E)$ from $\mu_n\to\mu$ weakly, while we only need to know $\mu_n\to\mu$ vaguely in order to conclude $\mu_n\to\mu$ weakly? Now assume we have complete locally compact separable metric spaces $E_1,\ldots,E_k$ . I would like to show that $$\tilde M:=\left\{\prod_{i=1}^k(f_i\circ\pi_i):f_i\in C_0(E_i)\right\},$$ where $\pi_i:\times_{j=1}^dE_j\to E_i$ is the projection onto the $i$ th coordinate) is convergence determining (on $\times_{i=1}^kE_i$ ). Again in Ethier/Kurtz, Proposition 4.6 of Chapter 3, we find the claim that if $M_i\subseteq C_b(E_i)$ is convergence determining (on $E_i$ ), then $$M:=\left\{\prod_{i=1}^k(f_i\circ\pi_i):f_i\in M_i\cup\color{red}{\left\{1\right\}}\right\}$$ is convergence determining. I would clearly take $M_i=C_0(E_i)$ (which is convergence determining by the former result and since $C_c(E_i)$ is dense in $C_0(E_i)$ by definition). However, Ethier/Kurtz allow $f_i$ to be the constant function $1$ (which is clearly not in $C_0(E_i)$ , unless $E_i$ is compact). They state Proposition 4.6 in the more general case of a countable product, but I don't think that this is the reason why we need to allow $f_i\equiv 1$ . On the other hand, taking $k=1$ yields a result weaker than what we assume beforehand (we start with $M_1$ being convergence determining and conclude $M_1\cup\left\{1\right\}$ is convergence determining). Question 2 : What am I missing here? Is my $\tilde M$ convergence determining?","['weak-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

3190258,Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular,"It would be very appreciated if someone could review my solution. Thanks! Problem: Show that every locally compact Hausdorff space is completely regular. Proof: Let $X$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space. One point sets are closed in $X$ since $X$ is Hausdorff. Then there is a space $Y$ such that $Y$ is the one point compactification of $X$ where $Y$ is compact Hausdorff. Let $x_0 \in X$ and $B \subset X$ such that $x_0 \notin B$ and $B$ is closed in $X$ . Then the open set $U = X - B$ contains $x_0$ . Then since $U$ is open in $X$ it is also open in $Y$ by construction of the one point compactification Munkres gives. Then $C = Y - U$ is a closed set in $Y$ that contains $B$ . Then since Y is compact Hausdorff it is also normal. Hence since the set $\{x_0\}$ is closed since Y is Hausdorff, by the Urysohn lemma we can define a continuous function $f: Y \to [a,b]$ such that $f(x_0) = a$ and $f(x) = b$ for every $x \in C$ . But since $f$ is continuous we can take the continuous function $g$ on a subspace of the domain of $f$ . Namely, $g: X \to [a,b]$ since $X$ is a subspace of $Y$ . Hence we have a continuous function $g$ that maps $g(x_0) = a$ and $g(B) = b$ , since $B \subset C$ . We can replace $[a,b]$ by $[0,1]$ to satisfy the definition of completely regular. Hence $X$ is completely regular.","['separation-axioms', 'general-topology', 'solution-verification', 'compactness']"

3190288,Proof - Graph Connectedness,"Let $n\ge2$ be an integer. Let $G$ be a graph with $n+1$ vertices and
  more than ${n \choose 2}$ edges. Show that $G$ is connected. Here's my attempted solution to the above problem: Induction on $n$ : Base case: $n=2$ So $n+1=3$ vertices. $\vert E\vert \gt {2 \choose 2} = 2$ so at least 3 edges, so connected. Inductive step: Assume $G$ connected for graph with $n+1$ vertices and $\vert E\vert \gt {n \choose 2}$ for all $n\ge2$ . Define $G\prime$ graph with $n+2$ vertices and $\vert E\vert \gt {n+1 \choose 2}$ . Notice that $G\prime$ forms the complete graph $K_{n+1}$ with $n+1$ vertices and exactly ${n+1 \choose 2}$ edges (which is connected by IA). Now assume for contradiction that $G\prime$ is disconnected. Since we need to use more edges than ${n+1 \choose 2}$ that are used for $K_{n+1}$ , there is nowhere to else to add the edge back in other than between the complete graph and the vertex not included in it. We then obtain one connected component or a connected graph $G\prime$ which contradicts initial assumption. All graphs $G$ connected for $n\ge2$ . (Q.E.D) Is this proof correct?

3190509,Why is this proof of a congruence relation valid?,"The following question comes from the 2012 Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (Open Section), Round 2. Let $p$ be an odd prime. Show that $$1^{p-2}+2^{p-2}+3^{p-2}+\dots+\left(\frac{p-1}2\right)^{p-2}=\frac{2-2^p}{p}\pmod p.$$ After trying and failing to find a proof, I went to look at the official solution, which is as follows. Note that for every $k=1,2,\dots,(p-1)/2$ , it is true that $$\frac{2k}p\binom{p}{2k}=\frac{(p-1)(p-2)\dotsm(p-2k+1)}{(2k-1)!}=-1\pmod{p}.$$ Therefore, the LHS is $$\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-2}=-\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-2}\frac{2k}{p}\binom{p}{2k}=-\frac2p\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}k^{p-1}\binom{p}{2k}=-\frac2p\sum_{k=1}^{(p-1)/2}\binom{p}{2k}.$$ The summation in the last equality counts the number of even-sized nonempty subsets of a $p$ -element set, which is $2^{p-1}-1$ . I have a problem with the proof, in the last equality. I know that the proof goes on the idea that $k^{p-1}=1$ for every $k\neq 0$ (Fermat's Little Theorem), but doesn't that mean that we have to work inside $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ , which would make the $-\frac2p$ a division by $0$ ? To illustrate, suppose we claimed that $$\frac{2-2^p}p=\frac2p(1-2^{p-1})=\frac2p(1-1)=0\pmod p.\tag{1}$$ This is of course absurd, because we really have a $0/0$ in the last step, so we are dividing by $0$ . Indeed we can see (for example) that $(2-2^3)/3=-2$ , which is not divisible by $3$ . So when we are working inside $\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ , it is not possible to divide by $p=0$ .

3190687,Actuarial practice exam: Find number of exponential data values above threshold given MLE.,"I was going thorough an actuarial exam and came across a problem that I can't figure out. Here is the problem as stated on the practice exam: You are given: $\bullet$ An insurance product with a per loss limit of 200 covers losses from an exponential distribution with parameter $\theta$ . $\bullet$ Based on the following table, the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$ is 168. $$\begin{array}{|c | c | c |}\hline
\text{Size of loss} & \text{Number of claims} & \text{Sum of losses} \\ \hline
\text{Less than  } 200 & 1,114 & 142,752\\ \hline
\text{At least  } 200 & N & 200N \\ \hline
\end{array}$$ Calculate $N$ for the table above. The answer is: $N$ is less than 250. My question: How can we know for sure that $N$ is less than 250? It can be thought of as a random variable, couldn't it? It could be that there is a single loss above 200 but very large so that the overall average is still 168, yes? It seems that we are supposed to assume that the losses above 200 are exponential with mean 168 above 200 by the memoryless property and thus $$\frac{142752+368N}{1114+N}=168$$ gives $N=222$ , which aligns well with the official answer. But with the given information, it could be that the first 1,114 data points are all 128.14 and then we have a single data point of 44568.

My book is From Calculus to Cohomology by Ib Madsen and JÃ¸rgen Tornehave. I didn't study much of the definitions or theorems in the book, if they were already found in An Introduction to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu. I mostly assume they're the same until there is evidence otherwise. In Chapter 11, Madsen and Tornehave define ""local index"", which looks to me like just a different way to say sign of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix that represents the differential (See Tu Proposition 8.11 ; Tu Section 23.3 ; Madsen and Tornehave Lemma 10.1 ; Madsen and Tornehave Lemma 10.3 ; Wikipedia Degree of a continuous mapping , specifically this ). Now, for a regular point $q \in f^{-1}(p)$ for a regular value $p$ that is in the image of $f$ (For a regular value $p$ that isn't in the image of $f$ , I'm sure there are neat vacuous arguments that I'm gonna skip), it says the local index is defined as $1$ if $D_qf$ preserves orientation and $-1$ otherwise. I was surprised to see orientation-preserving as an adjective for an isomorphism of vector spaces because I'm used to seeing orientation-preserving as an adjective for diffeomorphisms of manifolds. However, $T_pN^n \cong \mathbb R^n$ (vector space isomorphic), so I guess tangent spaces of manifolds are manifolds as well, assuming the image of an oriented manifold under a vector space isomorphism is also an oriented manifold or something. ( This question seems to confirm that tangent spaces of manifolds are manifolds, although I think the definition in the question is the same as the one in Madsen and Tornehave but different from the one in Tu). Actually, upon a second reading of the answer of Alex Mathers to that question, I think I have an answer to my question: Any vector space isomorphism, of tangent spaces of manifolds or any other vector spaces, turns out to be a homeomorphism. While my question is diffeomorphism, it turns out John M. Lee's Example 1.24 , which was pointed out by Alex Mathers, shows that any isomorphism of finite real vector spaces is a diffeomorphism as well. Rather than analyzing the example, I'm going to try a different proof.) I think that $D_qf$ , or $f_{*, q}$ in Tu's notation, is a diffeomorphism of the tangent spaces as manifolds because: $D_qf$ is surjective either by definition of $q$ being a regular point (Tu Definition 8.22 ) or by $q \in f^{-1}(p)$ and definition of $p$ being regular value of $f$ that is in the image of $f$ (Madsen and Tornehave Chapter 11 ). $D_qf$ is a homomorphism of tangent spaces (almost immediately from definition, but anyway, this follows from Tu Exercise 8.3 ). $D_qf$ is injective, by this , because of (1), (2) and that the dimensions of $T_qN$ and $TpM$ are finite and equal. $D_qf$ is a local diffeomorphism of manifolds if and only if for each $X_q \in T_qN$ , the (double) differential $D_{X_q}(D_qf): T_{X_q}(T_qN) \to T_{D_qf(X_q)}(T_pM)$ is an isomorphism of (double) tangent spaces, by the Inverse Function Theorem for manifolds (specifically by Tu Remark 8.12 , which gives a ""coordinate-free description"" for Tu Inverse Function Theorem for manifolds (Tu Theorem 6.26) ) $D_qf$ is a diffeomorphism of manifolds if and only if $D_qf$ is a bijective local diffeomorphism of manifolds (at each $X_q \in T_qN$ ) by this . $D_qf$ is an isomorphism of tangent spaces by (1), (2) and (3). Every $D_{X_q}(D_qf)$ is identical to $D_qf$ itself, by Tu Problem 8.2 (also found in this question and this question ), because of (2). Every $D_{X_q}(D_qf)$ is an isomorphism of tangent spaces because of (6) and (7). $D_qf$ is a local diffeomorphism of manifolds (at each $X_q \in T_qN$ ) by (4) and (8). $D_qf$ is a diffeomorphism of manifolds by (1), (3), (5), and (9).","['proof-verification', 'vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Please do. In jnez71's answer, he concludes that laplace transform is a change of basis, Now lets look at that mysterious laplace transform. $$\mathscr{L}(f(x)) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-sx}f(x) \, dx$$ Imagine all possible values of $e^{-sx}$ in a big matrix $^1$ , where each
  row corresponds to plugging in a specific $s$ and each column
  corresponds to plugging in a specific $x$ . (This matrix is orthonormal
  if $s=i\omega$ , i.e. the Fourier transform). If you select some $s$ ,
  you are plucking out a specific value of the function that resulted
  from the multiplication of this matrix with the vector $f(x)$ , a
  function we call $F(s):=\mathscr{L}(f(x))$ . Specifically, $$F(s=3) =
> f(x) \cdot e^{-3x}$$ (where that dot is an inner product, not ordinary multiplication). We
  say that $F(s)$ is just $f(x)$ expressed on a basis of exponential
  functions $^2$ . Choosing a specific value of $s=s_1$ is picking out the
  value of $f(x)$ in the $e^{-s_1x}$ direction . The entire $e^{-sx}$ can be viewed as the change of basis matrix. Wait, what basis were we on before if we're on the exponentials now?

3191024,What are mathematically definable/ useful properties of ternary relations? ( How to define for example symmetry or transitivity?),"My question may seem gratuitous. Here are my presuppositions. What makes a relation mathematically interesting is that one can define abstract properties of this relation , such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity. These three are, it seems to me, the basic ones. So, knowing that ternary relations exist and are sometimes used  in mathematics  ( for example the relation of colinearity in geometry), I presuppose that abstract properties can be defined for these relations that make them interesting. So I began to ask myself how to define these properties for ternary relations. And I started  with reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. But maybe I did not take the right way. What other properties are interesting for ternary relations? As an attenpt to define reflexivity for a ternary relation , I would say that R  is reflexive iff ( for all a, the triple ( a,a,a) belongs to R ). But I cannot manage to find a plausible definition of symmetry or of transitivity for ternary relations. Symmetry requires the notion of , so to say, "" converse"" n-tuple. The "" converse"" couple of (a,b) is (b,a). What would be the "" converse"" triple of 
(a,b,c)? Should one  say ( a, c, b)? ( c, a ,b) ? If I analyse (a,b,c) as ( (a,b), c); may I say that ( c, (a,b) ) is its "" converse"" triple? The problem, is, apparently, that if ( (a,b), c) ( with a, b and c elements of some set A) belongs to a relation R, this relation is from AÂ² to A . But the pair ( c, (a,b)) is not a possible element of a relation from AÂ² to A. So the second pair cannot belong to the same relation as the first one . But this is required to define symmetry: a pair and it's ""converse"" pair have to belong to the same relation in order this relation to be called symmetric.

3191570,Are there trilinear inner products?,"Is there such a thing as a ""trilinear inner product""? The definition of an inner product is: Let $H$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{K}\in \{\mathbb{R,C}\}$ . An inner product is a map $\langle \cdot|\cdot\rangle: H^2 \to \mathbb{K}$ such that for all $x,y,z \in H$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{K}$ the following properties hold: Bilinearity: $\langle x+\lambda y | z\rangle = \langle x|z\rangle + \lambda \langle y|z\rangle $ Complex conjugacy: $\overline{\langle y | x \rangle} = \langle x | y \rangle$ Positive definiteness: $||x||^2:=\langle x | x \rangle$ > 0 if $x \neq 0$ Can this be modified to have a trilinear map $\langle \cdot |\cdot| \cdot \rangle : H^3 \to \mathbb{K}$ ? Would it for example be possible to make $L^3$ into a ""trilinear inner product space"" like $L^2$ is a ""bilinear inner product space""? What is so special about the number $2$ in this context? Of course $2$ is the only number that is conjugate to itself in the sense that $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$ , so there would be no nice identification of this trilinear inner product space with its dual. I guess that there is no useful notion because the complex conjugacy can't be modified to get a trilinear inner product: $\mathbb{C}$ is a field extension of degree $2$ of $\mathbb{R}$ , but there is no field extension of degree $3$ of the reals this inner product could be defined over. What if the ""trilinear space"" is solely defined over $\mathbb{R}$ ?","['inner-products', 'multilinear-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"
3191645,Uniqueness of spanning tree on a grid.,"When I was at the Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference earlier this month, someone introduced me to a puzzle game called Noodles! . The game starts with a collection of ""pipes"" on a grid (centered on each vertex), clicking on a piece rotates it $90^\circ$ , and a piece can be rotated any number of times. The goal is to turn the final configuration of pipes into a spanning tree (of the grid graph), as shown in the screenshots below. Example Question We left the conference with an unsolved question:
Are solutions to this puzzle always unique? Or is it possible to come up with a starting configuration (on any size grid) that has multiple trees as solutions? (The prevailing guess is that solutions are unique, but nobody could manage to prove it.)","['graph-theory', 'trees', 'puzzle', 'combinatorics']"
3191721,Minimum number of dominoes on an $n \times n$ chessboard to prevent placement of another domino.,"OEIS sequence A280984 (based on this Math Stack Exchange question ) describes the minimum number of dominoes on an $n \times n$ chessboard to prevent placement of another domino. The sequence begins: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 17, 22, 27, 34, 41, 48, 57, 66, 75 Fifteen terms are known, and a few folks have conjectured that $$
   A280984(n) = \left\lceil \frac {n^2}3 \right\rceil \text{ for } n > 1.
$$ Andrey Zabolotskiy has a proof that (1) this is a lower bound , and (2) this conjecture holds when $n$ is a multiple of $3$ . In order to prove the conjecture it is sufficient to give a tiling strategy for the $(3n+1)\times(3n + 1)$ and $(3n+2)\times(3n+2)$ boards. Example of $3n \times 3n$ boards. To achieve this bound for the $3n \times 3n$ boards you can just do the naive placement, but for the other boards, it's not clear which placement strategy to use. (Notice that the second and third examples are not optimal: the last two boards have $35$ tiles and $42$ tiles respectively, but there exist $34$ and $41$ tile placements.) Question Is there simple strategy for the $(3n+1) \times (3n+1)$ and/or the $(3n+2) \times (3n+2)$ boards that attains the lower bound?

3191739,Meromorphic continuation of the multifactorial,"The double factorial $z!!$ , like the normal factorial function, can be extended to the complex plane using $$ z!! = 2^{z/2} \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{(\cos\pi z-1)/4} \left(\frac{z}{2}\right)! $$ which is a slightly nicer-looking variant from Wolfram Mathworld and is what you get when you type in ""double factorial"" in Wolfram Alpha. (NB $z! = \Gamma(z+1)$ just for consistency here.) The function can take complex numbers, and satisfies the empty product , $0!! = 1$ as well as the double factorial for negative numbers using the identity $$ x!! = x(x-2)!! \implies x!! = \frac{(x+2)!!}{x+2} $$ thus the poles at even negative numbers and the intermediate values $(-1)!! = 1$ , $(-3)!! = -1$ , $(-5)!! = 1/3$ , etc. My question is that is there a similar extension for the triple factorial and further multifactorials? I know there are extensions for the general multifactorial, but they don't cover all the premises raised here. For example, this function is one possible extension: $$ z\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}} = \alpha^{(z-1)/\alpha}\frac{(z/\alpha)!}{(1/\alpha)!}$$ but here $0!\cdots ! \neq 1$ . Has there been found a meromorphic function $z\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}}, \alpha\gt 0$ (probably in the form $f(z)(z/\alpha)!$ ) to the multifactorial such that they agree with the following...? $$z\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}} = \prod_{k=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{z-1}{\alpha}\right\rfloor}(z-\alpha k)\qquad z\in\mathbb{N} \tag{1} $$ $$ \left.\begin{aligned} z\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}} = \frac{(z+\alpha) \overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}}}{z+\alpha} \\ \implies (-n\alpha)\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}} = \pm\infty \end{aligned} \ \right\} \ n\in\mathbb{N}\backslash 0 \tag{2} $$ $$ 0\overset{\alpha}{\overbrace{!\cdots !}}  =1 \tag{3}$$","['factorial', 'analytic-continuation', 'complex-analysis', 'gamma-function', 'meromorphic-functions']"

The proof is required to be made through the binomial theorem. I will expose the demonstration I was tought, and forward my questions after exposing it. You'll see question marks like this one (?-n) on points I don't quite understand, where $n$ is the numeration of the mark. This are the doubts I have about the demonstration, the which I hope someone can clarify. Prove that $\binom{n}{0}^2 + \binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \binom{n}{n}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$ . We will use the following equality, and call it $P$ : $(1+x)^n(1+x)^n=(1+x)^{2n}$ (?-1) The result will be proved finding the $x^n$ coefficient of both terms of this equality (?-2) . According to the binomial theorem, the left-hand side of this equation is the product of two factors, both equal to $\binom{n}{0}1+\binom{n}{1}x+...+\binom{n}{r}x^r+...+\binom{n}{n}x^n$ When both factors multiply, a term on $x^n$ is obtained when a term of the first factor has some $x^i$ and the term of the second factor has some $x^{n-i}$ . Therefor the coefficients of $x^n$ are $\binom{n}{0}\binom{n}{n}+\binom{n}{1}\binom{n}{n-1}+\binom{n}{2}\binom{n}{n-2}+...\binom{n}{n}\binom{n}{0}$ . Since $\binom{n}{n-r}=\binom{n}{r}$ , the previous summation is equal to $\binom{n}{0}^2 + \binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \binom{n}{n}^2$ . So the left hand side of the equation we are asked to proove is a coefficient of $x^n$ . When we expand the right-hand side of the equation $P$ , we find that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is a coefficient of $x^n$ . Therefore (?-3) the left-hand side of the equation we were asked to prove is in deed equal to $\binom{2n}{n}$ . In conclussion, $\binom{n}{0}^2 + \binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \binom{n}{n}^2 = \binom{2n}{n}$ . This was all the demonstration. My doubt one (?-1) goes about where the heck does this equation come from?

Doubt two (?-2) goes about why would the solution of the first equation would have anything to do with finding the $x^n$ coefficients of the one I just made up (see doubt one).

I don't see how to prove this fact. Question2: If question1 has a negative answer, how should such a statement be understood?

3192540,Is a HNN extension of a virtually torsion-free group virtually torsion-free?,"Let $G=\langle X\ |\ R\rangle$ be a (finitely presented) virtually torsion-free group.

3192613,Special case of Bertrand Paradox or just a mistake?,"I've been working on a question and it seems I have  obtained a paradoxical answer. Odds are I've just committed a mistake somewhere, however, I will elucidate the question and my solution just in case anyone is interested. I want to know what is the average distance between two points on a circle of radius 1 where we consider only the boundary points. My attempt is as follows: Consider a segment of the diameter x which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2. Then you can calculate the distance between the points (2,0) and the point determined by x just by elementary geometry as this picture shows: Here in the picture, the green segment is the geometric mean and the orange one is the distance whose distribution we want to know.
Just by calculating the expected value, we obtain: $E\left(\sqrt{(4-2X)}\right) = \int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{(4-2x)}\cdot\frac{1}{2} dx = 1.333.... = \frac{4}{3}$ Where $\sqrt{(4-2x)}$ is the transformation of the random variable and $\frac{1}{2}$ is the pdf of a uniform distribution $[0,2]$ . Also, if we derive the pdf of the transformation we obtain the same result: $y = \sqrt{(4-2x)} , x = 2- \frac{y^2}{2}, \mid\frac{d}{dy}x\mid = y$ $g(y)=f(x)\cdot\mid\frac{d}{dy}x\mid = \frac{1}{2}\cdot y$ $E(Y)= \int_{0}^{2}y\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot y dy = 1.333.... = \frac{4}{3} $ I have seen a different approach somewhere else where the distribution of the angle is considered as a uniform distribution between 0 and $\pi$ and the final result was: $1.27... = \frac{4}{\pi}$ That's pretty much the problem I found. Maybe I just did it wrong in some step but it all makes sense to me. I know this is not exactly what we refer as Bertrand paradox but it just suggests something like that because both problems handle with segments in circumference and maybe my result is wrong because it does not hold for rotations of the circle or something like that (I read a little bit about the Bertrand's Paradox). That's pretty much it. Also sorry for my bad English and maybe I'm also wrong in something pretty elemental since I've just started learning about probability theory.

Moreover these three capture the ""natural"" idea of order I may think of, at different levels. On the other hand directed set are less intuitive to me. Clearly do not fit into the hierarchy since they do not libk with partially ordered sets, but totally ordered sets are directed, even if the converse does not hold.

3192647,"Understanding HNN extensions: intuition, examples, exercises.","What is an HNN extension? What would be some elementary, intuitive examples of them and what exercises involving them would you suggest? The Wikipedia definition is easiest to get to, since neither indexes of Magnus et al. nor Johnson's ""Presentation $\color{red}{s}$ of Groups (Old Version)"" indicate where they are. Here it is for convenience: Let $G$ be a group with presentation $G=\langle S\mid R\rangle$ , and let $\alpha: H\to K$ be an isomorphism between two subgroups of $G$ . Let $t$ be a symbol not in $S$ , and define $$G\ast_\alpha=\langle S, t\mid R, tht^{-1}=\alpha(h)\forall h\in H\rangle.$$ The group $G\ast_\alpha$ is called the HNN extension of $G$ relative to $\alpha$ . The original group $G$ is called the base group for the construction, while the subgroups $H$ and $K$ are the associated subgroups . The new generator $t$ is called the stable letter . The definition in Lyndon & Schupp's ""Combinatorial Group Theory"" , despite the concept being mentioned a few times prior to it, is on page 179. It's very similar: Let $G$ be a group, and let $A$ and $B$ be subgroups of $G$ with $\phi: A\to B$ an isomorphism. The HNN extension of $G$ relative to $A$ and $B$ and $\phi$ is the group $$G^\ast=\langle G, t\mid t^{-1}at=\phi(a), a\in A\rangle.$$ The group $G$ is called the base of $G^\ast$ , $t$ is called the stable letter , and $A$ and $B$ are called the associated subgroups . The definition in Baumslag's ""Topics in Combinatorial Group Theory"" , page 66, reads Definition 2: Let $$B=\langle X\mid R\rangle$$ be a group given by a presentation and suppose $U$ and $V$ are subgroups of $B$ equipped with an isomorphism $$\tau: U\stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} V.$$ Then we term $$E=\langle X, t\mid R\cup\{ tut^{-1}=u\tau\}\rangle\quad(\text{where }t\notin X)$$ an HNN extension of $B$ with stable letter $t$ , associated subgroups $U$ and $V$ and associating isomorphism $\tau$ . These are all well & good. I can see how they are equivalent quite readily. The definition in Stillwell's ""Classic Topology and Combinatorial Group Theory (Second Edition)"" is on page 286 and is much different. I shan't copy it down, for it's quite lengthy, but, again, I can sort of see what it's getting at. There are three exercises on HNN extensions starting on that page too, now that I've looked at the dreaded topology book, so I'll give them a go now.

Let $T: H\longrightarrow H$ be a bounded linear operator on $H$ such that the inner product satisfies $$\langle Tx, x \rangle \geq \|x\|^2 \tag{A}$$ Prove that a solution for the equation $Tx = y$ exists for all $y \in H$ . I've been looking at this problem and studying orthogonal complements and the direct sum theorem for a few days now, to no avail, so I suspect there's something very fundamental I don't understand here. Below I'm posting W. Zhan's proof that I don't understand, and a couple of starting points of my own. W. Zhan's, as mentioned below, isn't working for me, so I'm starting a bounty. Thank you. Proof given by W. Zhan Note that adjoint of a bounded operator always exists by Riesz Represenation Theorem. So we have $$ \langle Tx,x \rangle = \langle x, T^*x \rangle  \ge ||x||^2$$ So $T^*$ is injective. We also have $im T^\perp =  \ker T^*$ . Hence, $im T = H$ . I'm not sure what I'm not understanding. I do understand So $T^*$ is injective. and also We also have $im T^\perp =  \ker T^*$ but not how those two facts yield the conclusion. Here's a couple starts I've had on my own Proof (alternate start 1) Let $Tx = 0$ , then $$0 = \langle Tx, x\rangle \geq \|x\|^2 \geq 0$$ so $\|x \| = 0$ , but by definition of the norm, only if $x = 0$ . So $Tx = 0 \iff x = 0$ , therefore $T$ is injective. This means $T$ has an inverse linear operator $T^{-1}$ . Now, let $y \in \overline{TH}$ . By definition, $y$ is a limit point of $TH$ , so there exists a sequence $(x_n)$ in $H$ such that $(Tx_n) \longrightarrow y$ . However, $x_n = T^{-1}Tx_n$ , which implies $$\lim_{n\to \infty}x_n = \lim_{n\to \infty} T^{-1}Tx_n  = T^{-1}\lim_{n \to \infty}Tx_n = T^{-1}y$$ ... here I think I'm in trouble because I don't know if I can actually show $T^{-1}y$ exits, which I think is equivalent to showint $T^{-1}$ is bounded. Proof (alternate start 2) Here, as W. Zhan pointed out, it's easy to see that $(TH)^\perp = \{0\}$ , which implies that $TH$ is dense in $H$ . In other words, $\overline{TH} = H$ . So all that remains is to show that $TH$ is closed. But this is similar to the argument in my first attempt. Discussion I understand that $T^*$ is injectiveâ€”because it is a linear operator and $Tx = 0 \implies x = 0$ . In fact $T$ is as well. So I believe another option is to show surjectivity of $T$ , but I can see how to do that.

Assume $f$ is not a constant. Than $f$ must have a stationary point, $a$ . Assume it's a max point. Than $f''$ must be negative in a neighborhood of that point. Now let's prove that $f''$ has at least one zero in $[-\infty, a ]$ ... From this my proof gets really messy...",['analysis']
3193336,WeitzenbÃ¶ck identity for $TM$-valued differential forms,"Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold, and let $\nabla$ denote its Levi-Civita connection. We have two second order differential operators $\Gamma(T^*M \otimes TM) \to \Gamma(T^*M \otimes TM)$ : The Bochner Laplacian $\Delta_B=\nabla^* \nabla$ , and the ""Hodge"" Laplacian $\Delta_H=\delta_{\nabla} d_{\nabla}+d_{\nabla}\delta_{\nabla}$ , where here $d_{\nabla}: \Omega^1(M,TM) \to \Omega^2(M,TM)$ is the covariant exterior derivative associated with the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ , and $\delta_{\nabla}$ is its adjoint. Is there some kind of WeitzenbÃ¶ck formula connecting these two Laplacians? something like $\Delta_H-\Delta_B=C(R^{\nabla})$ , where $R^{\nabla}$ is the curvature tensor of $\nabla$ ? I know that for real-valued one-forms, the classical WeitzenbÃ¶ck formula is $\Delta_H-\Delta_B=\text{Ric}$ , where "" $\text{Ric}$ "" denotes the Ricci curvature of the manifold. Can we do something similar here?","['riemannian-geometry', 'curvature', 'laplacian', 'differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

3193377,"Rewrite $(\det A)^{1/n}=\min\left\{\frac{\mathrm{tr}(AC)}{n}:C \in \Bbb{C}^{nÃ—n},C>0,\det C=1\right\}$ in terms of $\frac{\rm{tr}(CAC)}{n}$","Given $$
(\det A)^{1/n} = \min \left\{\frac{\operatorname{tr}(AC)}{n} : C \in {\Bbb C}^{n \times n}, C > 0, \det C = 1\right\}. \label1\tag1
$$ Question Show that the formula can be rewritten as $$
(\det A)^{1/n} = \min \left\{\frac{\operatorname{tr}(CAC)}{n} : C \in {\Bbb C}^{n \times n}, C > 0, \det C = 1\right\}. \label{2}\tag{2}
$$ Then, show by an example that the formula \eqref{1} is false if $A$ is singular. My approach , would love to get your opinions: The determinant and the trace are two quite different beasts, little relation can be found among them. If the matrix is not only symmetric (hermitic) but also positive semi-definite , then its eigenvalues are real and non-negative. 
Hence, given the properties ${\rm tr}(AC)=\sum \lambda_c$ and ${\rm det}(A)=\prod \lambda_C$ , and recalling the AM GM inequality, we get the following (probably not very useful) inequality: $$\frac{\operatorname{tr}(AC)}{n} \ge {\det}(A)^{1/n}.$$ (equality holds iff $M = \lambda I$ for some $\lambda \ge  0$ ) My Solution: If $\det C = 1$ , could I say that $C$ is either an unity matrix or identity matrix, and hence it won't have any other max. or min. occurrences, thus the formula can be re-expressed as stated above? Could I say that $AC = A = $ matrix with all zeros and just eigenvalues on the diagonal $\lambda_1 ,..., \lambda_i,..., \lambda_n$ , then $$
\frac{\lambda_1 +...+\lambda_n}{n} \ge (\lambda_1 \cdot ... \cdot \lambda_n)^{1/n}$$ and $$
\frac{\lambda_1 +...+\lambda_n}{(\lambda_1 \cdot ... \cdot \lambda_n)^{1/n}} \ge n\:?
$$ Then, I say that if $A$ is singular then $\det A = 0$ thus one of the $\lambda_i = 0$ , therefore the product of all $\lambda_i = 0$ , thus, could I say that $\frac{0}{0} \ge n$ (although it's undefined), therefore, it contradicts the assumption and the formula doesn't hold for a singular matrix? What I'm struggling with: where I bolded ""could I say that"" - I'm not sure that it's correct and would love to know your opinion.","['trace', 'determinant', 'linear-algebra']"

3193511,How to prove this simple property for two sets?,"We are given two vectors, $a = (a_1,\dots,a_n)$ and $b = (b_1,\dots,b_n)$ such that $0 \le a_i=b_i \le \varDelta$ for $i=1,\dots,n$ . We want to modify each of these vectors in an iterative procedure such that in each iteration one component of each vector is increased. However, we do this for each vector differently. Let $0 \le \delta \le \varDelta$ be a given number. 
For vector $a$ , we select the minimum component , say $a_k$ , and increase it by $\min(\delta,\varDelta-a_k)$ . For vector $b$ , we select an arbitrary component , say $b_k$ , and increase it by $\min(\delta,\varDelta-b_k)$ . Let $a^\ell$ and $b^\ell$ represent the modified vectors at iteration $\ell$ . At the beginning, iteration $0$ , we have $a^0 = b^0=a=b$ . It is quite clear that $$
\min \{a^\ell_1,\dots,a^\ell_n\} \ge \min  \{b^\ell_1,\dots,b^\ell_n\}
$$ for any iteration $\ell$ . However, I have difficulty proving this simple logical fact, mathematically! I tried induction, proved it for $\ell=1$ , but could not succeed proving the next steps. Given that our statement is logically trivial, there should be some easy way to prove this. Any ideas? If that helps, all parameters are non-negative integers.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'supremum-and-infimum', 'alternative-proof']"
