2246986,Long line with large uncountable ordinals,"The long line, and long ray, is defined with respect to $\omega_1$, the first uncountable ordinal. Is it possible to construct a long line with any of the larger uncountable ordinals, a very long line, if you will? Would it still be a manifold, if so? From what I've seen, it is generally said that there are only 4 (Hausdorff) 1 dimensional manifolds. The line, circle, long ray and long line. But if a very long line existed, I would assume that it wouldn't be homeomorphic to the long line, since they would have a different cardinality.","['manifolds', 'general-topology', 'ordinals']"

2247130,Tightness + Integrability does not imply uniform integrability?,"Consider these definitions of tightness and integrability: A sequence of real-valued random variables $f_n$ on a probability space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is $\textit{tight}$ if for all $\epsilon$ there is a compact $K_{\epsilon}$ with $\mu(\{ x \mid f_n(x) \in K_{\epsilon} \}) > 1-\epsilon$ for all $n$. A sequence of real-valued random variables $f_n$ on a probability space
$(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ is $\textit{uniformly integrable}$ if two conditions are satisfied: $\sup_{n}\int_{X}|f_n|d\mu < \infty$ For all $\epsilon>0$ we can find a $\delta>0$ so that $\sup_n\int_{A}|f_n|d\mu < \epsilon$ whenever $\mu(A) < \delta$ I know that uniform integrability $\implies$ tightness. My first question was whether we can conclude the converse. Clearly the answer is no, since tightness does not require integrability. So my refined question is as follows: Let $f_n$ be a collection of real-valued random variables defined on the probability space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$, such that the $f_n$ are tight and  $\sup_{n}\int_{X}|f_n|d\mu < \infty$.

2247183,"If $P(A) = 1/3, P(B|A) = 3/5$, then $A$ and $B$ cannot be disjoint","Show that if $P(A) = 1/3, P(B|A) = 3/5$, then $A$ and $B$ cannot be
  disjoint The expression $P(B|A) = 3/5$ means that, given that $A$ happened, the probability of $B$ happening is $3/5$. However, it does not force $B$ to have or not a relation to $A$. What I know to be a universal rule is: $$P(A\cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)$$
When $A$ is independent from $B$, we have $P(A|B) = P(A)$. So in the two cases: they're dependent or not dependent, their product isn't $0$, right? So $A$ and $B$ cannot be disjoint. Even though I understand this proof, I cannot understand why this is true. Suppose that the probability of an event $A$ is $1/3$, and of the event $B$ is $3/5$, as stated in the question. Why cannot $A$ and $B$ be disjoint? $P(A\cap B)$ is just the probability that $A$ and $B$ occur together, right? Why this isn't possible?","['statistics', 'probability', 'elementary-set-theory']"

  individual chosen randomly in ths city, find the probability that
  this person is alergic given that it does not pratice sports While I was writing this exercise I found my error so I'm just gonna leave it here to help people I denoted by $A$ the event ""alergic"" and $S$ for sports. So, the exercise wants to know $P(A|S^c)$ which is by bayes theorem: $$P(A|S^c) = \frac{P(S^c|A)P(A)}{P(S^c)}$$ Well, $P(S^c|A) = 0.5$ since if $50\%$ of alergic people pratice, $50\%$ does not. The probability of being alergic is $20\%$ as said in the exercise. Now, $P(S^c)$ is the probability of: being alergic and do not pratice sports + not being alergic and do not pratice sports = $0.2\cdot 0.5 + 0.8 + 0.6$, so the result is: $$P(A|S^c) = \frac{P(S^c|A)P(A)}{P(S^c)} = \frac{0.5\cdot 0.2}{0.2\cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.6} = 0.172413\cdots$$ Turns out my error was that I was writing $P(S^c|A)$ as $0.5\cdot 0.2$ instead of just $0.5$","['statistics', 'probability']"

2247511,Ample invertible sheaves on projective surfaces,"This question popped up as I was thinking about intersection theory on fibered surfaces, which is slightly different from the situation I'm about to describe, and as a result I may have gotten some facts wrong. Anyway, here goes: Let $X$ be a regular projective surface. If $D$ be an ample effective divisor on $X$, corresponding to an ample invertible sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X(D)$ on $X$. Then, for every closed curve $C\subset X$, $\mathcal{O}_X(D)|_C$ is ample on $C$, and hence has positive degree as an invertible sheaf on $C$. In terms of intersection theory, this means that $D\cdot C > 0$ for every closed curve $C\subset X$. But...isn't the intersection pairing negative semidefinite? Hence, $D\cdot D\le 0$. At first, this seems like it would break the ampleness of $D$, and hence regular projective surfaces $X$ can't have any ample divisors, but this is plainly false since you can just take $X = \mathbb{P}^2$, and $D$ to be any prime divisor.

What is the standard for learning terminology (lets keep it specific to topology and functional analysis, though if other fields are applicable then there is no reason not to mention them), if such a standard exists?

2247940,Is this continuous analogue to the AM–GM inequality true?,"First let us remind ourselves of the statement of the AM–GM inequality: Theorem: ( AM–GM Inequality ) For any sequence $(x_n)$ of $N\geqslant 1$ non-negative real numbers, we have $$\frac1N\sum_k x_k \geqslant \left(\prod_k x_k\right)^{\frac1N}$$ It is well known that the sum operator ∑ can be generalised so that it operates on continuous functions rather than on discrete sequences. This generalisation is the integral operator ∫. Likewise, we can generalise the product operator to operate on continuous functions. We begin with the following property of the discrete product: $$\log\prod_k A_k=\sum_k \log A_k$$ (assuming that $A_k>0$). Using this we can define the continuous product (also known as the geometric integral according to Wikipedia ) as follows: $$\prod_a^b f(x)\ dx := \exp\int_a^b\log f(x)\ dx.$$ assuming that the integral converges. From these definitions we can seek to generalise the AM–GM inequality to continuous functions: Proposition: ( Continuous AM–GM Inequality ) For any suitably well-behaved non-negative function $f$ defined on $[a,b]$ with $a<b$, we have: $$\frac1{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)\ dx \geqslant \left(\prod_a^b f(x)\ dx\right)^\frac1{b-a}$$ or in traditional notation: $$\frac1{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)\ dx \geqslant \exp\left(\frac1{b-a} \int_a^b \log f(x)\ dx\right)$$ As a simple illustration, consider the function $f(x)=1+\sin x$ and fix the lower bound $a=0$. On the following graph the $x$-axis represents the upper bound of integration $b$, and on the $y$-axis are represented the the arithmetic mean (blue) and the geometric mean (red) of $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$ where $a=0$ and $b=x$. Clearly the claimed inequality seems to hold, and is in fact quite tight when $b\approx0$. This inequality is of interest not least because it is readily abe to produce a number of non-trivial numerical inequalities pertaining to known constants. For instance, again with the example $f(x)=1+\sin x$, set $b=\pi/2$. Then assuming the proposition holds, we have $$\frac{2}{\pi}\int_0^{\pi/2} 1 + \sin x\ dx \geqslant \exp \left( \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \log(1+\sin x)\ dx \right)$$ Evaluating these integrals and rearranging, we obtain: $$G \leqslant \frac\pi4\log\left(2+\frac2\pi\right) \approx 0.9313$$ where $G\approx 0.9159$ is Catalan's constant. Anyway I would like to ask, firstly: Is the claimed inequality true, and if so what is the proof and on what class of functions is it applicable? Secondly, and this is more of a fun little challenge: Assuming its veracity, can this inequality be used to prove remarkable numerical inequalities, e.g. $\pi < 22/7$ or $e^\pi - \pi < 20$?","['inequality', 'integration', 'integral-inequality', 'a.m.-g.m.-inequality']"
2247953,"For all positive integers, n, if $3^n \equiv 1 \mod 8$, then n is even.","I've had trouble trying to prove this statement. I have been at it for 4 hours, but I don't feel like the proof I produced is right. And since this is a simple question, I think I am missing some big point. I hope you guys can share some tips or feedback. Here's the solution I've come up with so far. I am sure there is a more elegant way. I was also thinking of maybe assuming n is odd and finding a contradiction or come to a false conslusion using P.M.I. (math induction). Let $n$ be a positive integer, then $n\geq1$. Suppose $3^n\equiv1 \pmod 8$. Then $8\mid 3^n-1$ and $3^n-1=8k$ for some integer $k$. Suppose $n$ is even, then $n=2v$ for some positive integer $v$. Then $$3^{2v}-1=8k=(3^2)^v-1=9^v-1,$$ which can be rewritten as $9^v-1=8k$. Now we need to prove that for every positive integer $v\geq 1$, $8\mid 9^v-1$ holds. Let $P(v)$ denote the statement $8|9^v-1$. We shall prove, by mathematical induction that $\forall v\geq1:P(v)$. 
For $v=1$, $$P(1)\iff 8\mid9-1\iff 8\mid 8,$$ $8$ does indeed divide itself. Hence the basis premise $P(1)$ is true. Now we shall work with the second step of this proof, which is the induction premise. Let $v$ be an integer, $v\geq 1$ and suppose that $P(v)$ is true. That is, suppose that $9^v-1=8m$ for some integer $m$ (induction hypothesis). It must be shown that $P(v+1)$ is true, that is $9^{v+1}-1=8p$ ($*$) for some integer $p$. Let’s expand ($*$).
$9^{v+1}-1 = 9^v9^1$. But, by substitution from the induction hypothesis we can rewrite it as:
$$(8m+1)9^1-1=72m+9-1=72m+8=8(9m+1)=8p$$
Thus, $P(v+1)$ is true for all $v\geq 1$. Thus, from the basis step and the induction premise and with the help of P.M.I we can conclude that $P(v)$ is true for all $v\geq 1$. Therefore the congruence holds for all positive and even integers $n$. Thanks in advance.","['congruences', 'proof-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"

POST MORTEM: The elephant, as all of you hinted, was the definition of a subspace $(X_0, \mathscr{O}|X_0)$ of a topological space $(X,\mathscr{O})$.

That means, when $X = \mathbb{R}$ and $X_0 = [0,1]$, that I was missing some really important open sets: All of $[0,1]$, $\{[0,n) \ \ | \ 0<n<1\}$, $\{(m,1] \ \ | \ 0<m<1\}$. And it's all downhill from there!","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

Now on Wikipedia I have found the following definition of irreducible component: An irreducible component of a topological space is a maximal irreducible subset. My question : What do we mean with maximal here? I thought if a subset is irreducible it is automatically maximal because we can not split it up into two smaller closed sets. Can someone explain what is wrong with my thought? It would be great if someone could give me an specific example (e.g. from the Zariski topology).

2248250,Every complex number has 2 square roots - Rudin,"I am using Baby Rudin for self study and as many of you are aware, it is one thing to follow Rudin's calculations to verify that his proof is correct. It is quite another to work backwards to see how he came up with his proof in the first place. I find that unless I do the latter, the former does absolutely nothing for me. Chapter 1 exercise 10 is as follows:
Suppose $z = a + bi$, $w = u + vi$ and 
$a = \left(\frac{|w| + u}{2}\right)^{1/2}$, $b = \left(\frac{|w| - u}{2}\right)^{1/2}$. Prove that $z^2 = w$ if $v \geq 0$ and $\overline{z}^2 = w$ if $v \leq 0$. Conclude that every complex number(with one exception) has two complex square roots.
It is pretty easy to verify this calculation:
If $v \geq 0$ then
$(a+bi)^2 = (-a - bi)^2= a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = \frac{|w| + u}{2} + \frac{|w| - u}{2} + 2i\left(\frac{|w| + u}{2}\right)^{1/2}\left(\frac{|w| - u}{2}\right)^{1/2} = u + 2i \sqrt{\frac{|w|^2 - u^2}{4}} = u + 2i\sqrt{\frac{u^2 + v^2 - u^2}{4}} = u + 2i \sqrt{\frac{v^2}{4}} = u + 2i\frac{|v|}{2} = u + |v|i = u + vi$
On the other hand if $v \leq 0$ then it is similar to show that
$(a - bi)^2 = (-a + bi)^2 = u - |v|i$ This completes the proof. Now for the backwards derivation attempt: We want $(a + bi)^2 = u + vi \implies a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = u + vi \implies a^2 - b^2 = u$ and $2ab = v$. So essentially we have a system of equations to solve for $a$ and $b$. I have been stuck on this for a couple hours.

Now given these integers, you can create a data structure (a number representation), such as a fraction, and ensure that each possible value that it can represent will only ever be represented in one way. For a fraction, we do this by removing all factors shared by the numerator and the denominator. This means that we can just compare each element of the fraction individually, and we never need to worry about accidentally comparing 12/4 with 3/1. We also have the ability, however, to do the simplification at the time of the comparison. Again with the fraction example, we can also find the common denominator of the two and scale them so that we can compare them (or something like that).

We can represent the distribution as a vector: $\vec{p}={p_1,p_2,p_3,...p_n}$ such that: $$\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\ =\ 1$$ and $$Entropy(\vec{p})=-\sum_{i=1}^n p_i\ log_2(p_i)\ =\ h$$ for a known $h$ between $0$ and $log_2(n)$. Specifically, I know $h$ and I want to randomly select $n$ values that satisfy the above conditions for that $h$. The set of values ${p_1,p_2,p_3,...p_n}$ should be uniformly distributed. In other words, the probability density function of a point should match the probability density function of a point uniformly distributed on a simplex. See this post about randomly generating points on a simplex. To put it in formal terms, the distribution should be uniform in the sense that it will be the same as though the point were generated through rejection sampling of points on the simplex where any point $\vec{p}$ is rejected if outside of the $Entropy(\vec{p})$ is outside the range range $[h-\epsilon,h+\epsilon]$ for an infinitesimally small $\epsilon$. Update: If we raise each element of $\vec p$ to a power $x$ and then normalize the result by scaling it so that it sums to one, then we can adjust the entropy arbitrarily (provided that $\vec p$ doesn't represent an exactly uniform distribution). Based on this, I think we can randomly generate a point on the simplex and then just raise it to a power to adjust the entropy to the desired value.

For $\lambda=7$, my eigenvector came out to be, \begin{bmatrix} 2\\1\\0 \end{bmatrix} So no problems here. On the other hand, I had some difficulties for when $\lambda = 3$.

Is $\mathcal{F}_y$ the restriction of $\mathcal{F}$ onto the fiber $X_y$, i.e $\mathcal{F}_y = i^{-1} \mathcal{F}$, which is not necessarily locally free or even an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module, or is $\mathcal{F}_y$ the pullback, $i^* \mathcal{F}$ which is locally free and an $\mathcal{O}_x$-module? I imagine $\mathcal{F}_y$ should be the latter but I am not exactly sure what Hartshorne has in mind here. Furthermore, in the same corollary, he goes on to define the following sheaf: $\mathcal{F} \otimes k(y)$ where $k(y)$ is the constant sheaf on the closed subset $\overline{ \{ y \} }$ of $Y$. First of all, is $k(y)$ with this definition a sheaf on $Y$ via extension by zero? Also, I thought to take the tensor product of two sheaves they must both be modules over the same structure sheaf.

The fiber of the sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ is $\mathcal{F}(x) := \mathcal{F}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x} k(x)$ where $k(x)$ is the residue field for some point $x \in X$. Note that this is definitely a vector space over $k(x)$. Is $\mathcal{F}(x) \cong \pi^{-1}(x)$? It seems like a basic question but I cannot find a straightforward answer. Using the correspondence of between locally free sheaves of modules and vector bundles $\pi^{-1}(x) = \mathcal{F}_x / m_x \mathcal{F}_x$. 
We have the following: $$\mathcal{F}_x / m_x \mathcal{F}_x \cong \mathcal{F}_x \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_x} \mathcal{O}_x/m_x' \mathcal{O}_x \cong \mathcal{F}_x / m'_x \mathcal{F}_x$$.

Improve this question It seems that there are real integrals that are immune to all real methods of integration and one has to apply the residue theorem and contour integration. Here is my collection $$\int_0^1 x^{-x}(1-x)^{x-1}\sin \pi x\,\mathrm{d}x=\frac{\pi}{e}\tag {1}$$ $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{(e^{x}-x)^{2}+{\pi}^{2}}=\frac{1}{1+W(1)}=\frac{1}{1+\Omega}\tag {2}$$ $$\int^{\pi/2}_{0}\cos(xt)\cos^y(t)\,\mathrm{d}t=\frac{\pi \Gamma(x+1)}{2^{y+1}\Gamma\left(\frac{x+y+2}{2}\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{2-x+y}{2}\right)}\tag{3}$$ $$\int_0^{1}\arctan\left(\frac{\mathrm{arctanh}\ x-\arctan{x}}{\pi+\mathrm{arctanh}\ x-\arctan{x}}\right)\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{x}=\frac{\pi}{8}\log\frac{\pi^2}{8} \tag {4}$$ $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{(e^x+x+1)^2+\pi^2}=\frac{2}{3}\tag {5}$$ Are there any other examples ?

2249411,Positive cone of Banach lattice algebra,"From the literature on Banach lattice algebras (and that on ordered Banach algebras) there does not appear to be a consensus on a definition. What is agreed is that one should be a Banach lattice, be an associative algebra with a sub-multiplicative norm and that the product of positive elements should be positive. To standardise terminology we propose that a Banach lattice algebra simply is at the same time a Banach lattice, an algebra with the sub-multiplicative norm, and with the product of positive elements being positive. Question: For $X$ being a Banach lattice algebra endowed with an ordering $\leq$ , let $X_+:=\{x\in X:x>0\}$ be the positive cone. This cone would generally be open or closed? Please provide proof or hints to prove it with references.","['functional-analysis', 'banach-lattices', 'banach-spaces', 'banach-algebras']"

2249521,"If $A$ is a symmetric matrix, then $A^2$ is also symmetric","I first tried if the claim was true by testing it with a symmetric matrix, and I got that if I have a symmetric square matrix $A$ then $A^2$ is also symmetric.
So to prove this for a general case I did: First of all I take a general square matrix $$A=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
   a_{11} & a_{12} & ...a_{1n}\\
   a_{21} & a_{12} & ...a_{1n}\\
   ... & ... & ...\\
   a_{n1} & a_{n2} & ...a_{nn}\\
  \end{array} } \right]$$ we can see that the matrix above is symmetric because it is equal to its transpose. Then I calculate $$A^2=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
   \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{1k}a_{k1} & \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{1k}a_{k2} & ...\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{1k}a_{kn}\\
   \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{2k}a_{k1} & \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{2k}a_{k2} & ...\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{2k}a_{kn}\\
   ... & ... & ...\\
   \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{nk}a_{k1} & \sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{nk}a_{k2} & ...\sum\limits_{k=1}^n a_{nk}a_{kn}\\
  \end{array} } \right]$$ so I get that $A^2$ is symmetric because it is equal to its transpose $(A^2)^T$ or we can say that because $a_{ij}a_{ji}=a_{ji}a_{ij}$ for all $1\le i,j\le n$ . Do you think this is a good proof or how can I improve it? Thanks","['matrices', 'abstract-algebra', 'linear-algebra']"
2249528,A minimization problem in function fitting setup,"Let $\Omega$ be a convex, closed, compact set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a smooth boundary. Given a data $(x_i,d_i)$ , $x_i \in \Omega$ , $d_i \in \mathbb{R}$ , $i = 1,2,3...N$ , $N>d$ and $\sum\limits_{i=1}^N d_i = 0$ . Also given that, there are always $d$ vectors in $\{x_i\}$ which are linearly independent. Let $A = \int_{\Omega}dx$ I want to find a continuous function $f:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ , such that, $\int_{\Omega}f(x)dx = 0$ and $C(f)$ is minimum, where $$C(f) = \frac{A^{1/d}}{N}\bigg(\sum\limits_{i=1}^N |f(x_i)-d_i|^d\bigg)^{1/d} +\|f\|_{L^d}+ A^{1/d} \||\nabla f|\|_{L^d}$$ Does the solution exist?

2249571,Order preserving map $\mathbb R^2 \mapsto \mathbb R$,"What would be an order preserving map $\mathbb R^2 \mapsto \mathbb R$ if $\mathbb R^2$ is arbitrarily ordered by x then y? I saw the interleaving answers here: Examples of bijective map from $\mathbb{R}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ but they don't mention order preserving. Simply doing a linear transofrmation $w=5x+7y$ for example isn't order preserving because before $(1,1) < (2,0)$ but after $12 > 10$. So what would be an order preserving map? Is interleaving order preserving? Edit: By arbitrarily ordering $\mathbb R^2$ I mean using a comparer like this one: (a,b)=>{  //a,b are Vector2
    let x = a.x - b.x;
    if (x != 0){
        return x;
    }
    return a.y - b.y;  // a tie with x is broken with y
} So for example $(1,3) < (1,5) < (2,2)$ Another comparer is to set a known minimum point and then to compare distances from that point. My set of points is known to be ""larger"" than that minimum. For example: I set my minimum to $(0,0)$ and then order all the other points relative to their distance from that point. So we'll get: blue(2,3) < red(6,2) < green(9,5) etc.","['well-orders', 'real-numbers', 'order-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'group-theory']"
