Quick lookup in Gradshteyn—Ryzhik and Prudnikov et al. did not find this integral, and it also is returned unevaluated by Mathematica and Maple . How can we prove this result? Am I overlooking anything trivial? Further questions: Is it possible to generalize it and find a closed form of

Suppose that $f_n$ converges to $f$ uniformly on every compact subset of $U$ . Prove that $f$ is either constant or one-to-one on $U$ . Here's my proof. I would appreciate if you guys point out any possible mistakes, or maybe give a different proof that uses different techniques. We may assume that the zeros of $f$ have no accumulation point in $U$ , otherwise, $f$ is identically zero. Now we proceed by contradiction; suppose, WLOG, that $f$ has two zeros in $U$ ; say $f(a)=f(b)=0$ . There exists $\delta >0$ such that $a$ and $b$ are the only zeroes of $f$ in $B(a,\delta)$ and $B(b,\delta)$ , respectively. Moreover, the Maximum Modulus Principle implies that $|f(z)|>0$ on the boundaries of the two balls above; say $$|f(z)|>m>0\, \text{ for all }\, z\in \partial B(a,\delta)\cup \partial B(b,\delta).$$ Since $f_n \rightarrow f$ uniformly on compact sets, then for $n$ large enough, we have $$|f_n (z)-f(z)|<m<|f(z)| \, \text { for all } \,z\in \partial B(a,\delta)\cup \partial B(b,\delta).$$ By Rouche's Theorem, $f_n$ and $f$ have the same number of zeroes in $B(a,\delta)$ and $B(b,\delta)$ , namely one in each ball (not counting multiplicities). But this contradicts the assumption that $f_n$ is one-to-one.","['complex-analysis', 'proof-verification']"

1583017,Does sample-path continuity imply mean square continuity?,"Let $(X_t)_{t>0}$ be a square-integrable stochastic process on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. I'm well aware that in general almost sure convergence does not imply mean square convergence, unless some additional conditions (such as the ones of the dominated convergence theorem) are met. I've also come across this related question where the OP is interested in the case of (the weaker) almost sure continuity at a given time. However, in the stronger case of sample path continuity (i.e. $\forall \omega \in \Omega, t \to X(t, \omega)$ is a continuous function) I am curious as to whether the process would also be mean square continuous. If so, I'd appreciate any pointer to the proof. If not, can you please provide a counter-example? The counter-example provided in the question above does not have continuous paths. Please note that these lecture notes , more specifically the remark following Definition 72, seem to suggest that not only is it true in general, but the proof is also obvious.

1583103,Tablecloth & table problem,"Friday night we threw an house warming party and invited quite a number of fellow students. To fit everybody around the table we had to enlarge it, pulling out two sort of shelves from the short sides, but unfortunately our tablecloth was too small. Being a bunch of smart engineering students we started to discuss how to lay out the tablecloth on the table, whether an optimum existed and how to find it. Luckily enough beer and wine let us rapidly change the subject, but did not kill the curiosity. Here is some (sorta) math jargon, finally: you have a table of known dimensions $a$ and $b$ you have a tablecloth of known dimensions $c$ and $d$ $a>c>d>b$ holds$^*$ Thickness is not a problem, i.e. the tablecloth might hang how much you want and the table sides must not necessarily be covered. This is a problem on the plane . Your goal is to maximize the covered surface of the table, your knobs are three real numbers, the tablecloth position and its angle with respect to the table. I am afraid that the optimum depends on how the inequality holds, i.e. the solution changes dramatically if the tablecloth short side is, say, 100 times the table short side. If this is the case please stick to ""reasonable"" values, i.e. the difference between the various dimensions is within the $10\%$ range. And I also believe the solution is symmetrical, i.e. the tablecloth is centered on the table, but I am not entirely sure of it. Folding the tablecloth is not permitted, mainly because the problem gets heavily dependent on the ratio $\frac{d}{b}$. The question is: How can I prove there is an optimum and find it? $^*$this means that the tablecloth short side is longer than the table short side, and the table long side is longer than the tablecloth long side. Plus both the table and the tablecloth are rectangular.","['puzzle', 'optimization', 'geometry']"

1583149,How to describe the points of a quotient stack?,"Let $G$ be a finite algebraic group acting on a projective complex variety $X$. Then a quotient $Y=X/G$ exists as a scheme and, if $G$ acts freely, $Y$ is an orbit space and the natural map $$\eta:[X/G]\to X/G=Y$$ is an isomorphism.
I am trying to figure out how this isomorphism works at the level of points . The $\mathbb C$-points of $Y$ are the orbits of the action. These must correspond to the $\mathbb C$-points of the stack $[X/G]$, which are $G$-equivariant maps $G\to X$. I am trying to see how this correspondence works. I would say that a $G$-orbit $\textrm{Orb}(x)\subset X$ should correspond to the $G$-equivariant map $\alpha_x:G\to X$ sending $g\mapsto g\cdot x$. The orbit is just the image of this map. But conversely, if I have a $G$-invariant map $G\to X$, is it obvious that its image is an orbit? Let now $S$ be any scheme over $\mathbb C$. The $S$-points of the stack $[X/G]$ are couples $(P,f)$ where $P\to S$ is a principal $G$-bundle and $f:P\to X$ is a $G$-equivariant map. I cannot describe explicitly the $S$-points of $Y=X/G$. Question . Is it true, at least étale locally, that the $S$ points of $Y$ are the orbits of the action of $G(S)$ on $X(S)$? How do the

1583271,Partitions of the odd integers,"Understanding the nature of the odd integers is a necessity to prepare oneself to work on the unsolved problems in number theory, such as the Collatz $3n+1$ problem.     I hope to demonstrate how the odd integers can be represented as a sequence of sets which fit together like a glove with infinite fingers.  First, some definitions are required. Define a sequence $(A_k)$ of ordered sets by: $$ A_0 = \{3, 7, 11\} $$ $$ A_1 = \{1, 9, 17\} $$ $$ A_2 = \{13,29,45\} $$
$$ A_3 = \{5, 37, 69\} $$   and
$$ A_{k+2} = A_k + 4 ( A_k – A_{k-2}) \forall k>1, $$ Note that the operations implied are matrix addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication on the $1 \times 3$ matrices formed from sets $A_k.$ For example, when  $k=2$ we have:
$$ A_2 = \{13,29,45\}, \mbox{ in matrix form is }\begin{pmatrix}13 \\29 \\45\end{pmatrix} $$
$$ A_0 = \{3, 7, 11\}, \mbox{ in matrix form is }\begin{pmatrix}3\\ 7\\ 11\end{pmatrix} $$ By definition: $$A_4 = A_2 + 4 ( A_2 - A_0) $$ 
$$ A_4 = \begin{pmatrix}13\\ 29\\ 45\end{pmatrix} + 4\left(\begin{pmatrix}13\\ 29\\ 45\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}3\\ 7\\ 11\end{pmatrix}\right)$$
$$ A_4 = \begin{pmatrix}13\\ 29\\ 45\end{pmatrix} + 4\begin{pmatrix}10\\ 22\\ 34\end{pmatrix} $$
$$ A_4 = \begin{pmatrix}13\\ 29\\ 45\end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix}40\\ 88\\ 136\end{pmatrix} $$
$$ A_4 = \begin{pmatrix}53\\ 117\\ 181\end{pmatrix} $$ Converting back to set notation gives: 
$$ A_4 = \{53, 117, 181\} $$ The next step is to extend the finite sets $\,A_k\,$ to infinite sets $\,M_k\,$ as follows: Define: $$ M_k = \left\{p \in \mathcal{N}, p \equiv 1 \pmod 2 : \exists a \in A_k, p\equiv a\pmod {3\left(2^{k+2}\right)} \right\} $$ By definition of $M_0$: if $(a \in A_0)$, then
$$ a + 12i \in M_0, \forall i \in \mathcal{N},$$ By definition of $M_k$: if $ (a \in A_k)$ then 
$$ a+3i(2^{k+2}) \in M_k, \forall i \in \mathcal{N}. $$ Assertion: 
$$ \forall n \in \mathcal{N}, n\equiv 1\pmod 2,\,\exists k \in \mathcal{N}, k\geq0 \text { such that } n \in M_k $$ Since this analysis was developed informally, is there a better way to express the assertion in order to search for prior solutions?","['number-theory', 'collatz-conjecture']"

Hence the partial derivative of the metric tensor with respect to a coordinate $x^l$ is $$ \partial_l g_{ij} = \partial_l \frac{\delta_{ij}}{(1 - x_k x^k)^2} = \delta_{ij} \partial_l (1 - x_k x^k)^{-2} = -2 \delta_{ij} (1 - x_k x^k)^{-3} \partial_l (1 - x_k x^k) = 2 \delta_{ij} (1 - x_k x^k)^{-3} (x_k \partial_l x^k + x^k \partial_l x_k) = 2 \delta_{ij} (1 - x_k x^k)^{-3} (x_k \delta_l^k + x^k \delta_{lk}) $$ In summary $$ \partial_l g_{ij} = 2 \delta_{ij} (1 - x_k x^k)^{-3} (x_k \delta_l^k + x^k \delta_{lk}) = 4 \delta_{ij} (1 - x_k x^k)^{-3} x_l $$ The Christoffel symbols are defined in terms of the partial derivatives of the metric tensor as $$ \Gamma^i_{jk} = \frac{1}{2} g^{il} (\partial_j g_{lk} + \partial_k g_{lj} - \partial_l g_{jk}) $$ Hence we substitute our expression for $ \partial_l g_{ij} $ with the right indices.

1583474,Can a class test scores with a bimodal distribution provide statistical evidence for cheating?,"I know the normal distribution can represent many things in nature. Most items are normally distributed . I recently watched a video of a professor who claims that biomodal distributions provide evidence of cheating . He states that biomodal distribution "" when external forces are applied to a data set that creates a systematic bias to a data set "" aka cheating. He compares this information to previous grade distributions of students given the same test in other years when he gave the test and estimated that 1/3 of his students have cheated . My question is does a bimodal distribution really provide statistical evidence of cheating? Can't it be that some students do very poorly and some students do really well, leaving a peak that is low and a peak that is high? Do biomodal distribution really mean there is a higher probability of ""when external forces are applied to a data set that creates a systematic bias to a data set?"" The link to the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbzJTTDO9f4 Yes, I get some students admitted to cheating, but that doesn't answer my question. My question is can a teacher really provide statistical evidence of someone cheating without them admitting it? I know statistics is all about probability, so can a teacher claim that the probability of this is really lower than a certain threshold and say because of this there exist a statistical significance of them cheating? And how can they approximate 1/3 of there students cheated just by comparing the bimodal distribution to a normal distribution. To me, it seems that the teacher is just trying to use scare tactics with his ""statistics"" and guilt students into admitting to cheating rather than have any evidence of them cheating.

1583504,Absolute convergence in Banach space,"Let $X$ be a Banach space. Show that, if $\sum_{n\ge 1}x_{n}$ is absolutely convergent then $\sum_{n\ge 1}x_{n}$ is convergent and 
$$\left\|\sum_{n\ge 1}x_{n}\right\|\le \sum_{n\ge 1}\|x_{n}\|$$ I have tried this :
Let $\sum_{n\ge1}x_{n}$ be absolutely convergent, this is $\sum_{n\ge1}
	  \|x_{n}\|$ converges. So put $s_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{n}$ and 
      $p_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\|x_{n}\|$. We want to proof that $s_{n}$ is a 
      Cauchy sequence, and as $X$ is a Banach space it will follow  that 
      $s_{n}$ is convergent. But this is straight forward, because as $p_{n}$ is convergent we know that 
      $$\sum_{n\ge k}\|x_{n}\|\rightarrow 0\mbox{ when } k\rightarrow\infty, $$
      or more precisely given any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists an $N\in\mathbb{N}$ 
      such that 
      $$\sum_{n\ge k}\|x_{n}\|<\varepsilon,~\forall n\ge N$$ and so
      $$\|s_{n}-s_{m}\|=\left\|\sum_{k=\min\{m,n\}}^{\max\{m,n\}}x_{k}\right\|
	  \le \sum_{k\ge\min\{m,n\}}\|x_{k}\|<\varepsilon, \forall ~m,n\ge N.$$
      This proves that $s_{n}$ is convergent because any Banach space is complete. As for any integer $k$ 
      $$\left\| \sum_{n=1}^{k}x_{n}\right\|\le \sum_{n=1}^{k}\|x_{n}\|$$
      and the norm $\|\cdot\|$ is continuous, as $k\rightarrow\infty$ we get 
      $$\left\|\sum_{n\ge 1}x_{n}\right\|\le \sum_{n\ge 1}\|x_{n}\|.$$

As a function, $\mathbf{X}$ is defined on $M$ and at $p \in M$ it can take values on $T_p M$; in fancier terms, it is a cross section of the tangent bundle of $M$. Now let $\phi: M \to N$ be a smooth function (not necessarily a diffeomorphism) and $\phi_*$ its differential. What kind of object is $\phi_* \mathbf{X}$? Here are my thoughts: it's not really a vector field on $M$ or on $N$; rather, it's defined on $M$, but at $p \in M$ it takes values in $T_{\phi(p)} N$. Therefore, it's a cross section of a vector bundle with base space $M$ and tangent spaces on $N$ as fibres. At each point $p$ of $M$ we would place the tangent space $T_{\phi(p)}N$. Is this correct?

(shows they aren't isomorphic, but doesn't actually show the derivation for the 4 groups listed) So I wanted to ask, the specific question not yet presented, of how to derive that there must be 5 non isomorphic groups of order 12, and which groups those are. Work So Far: To begin with we have $|G|=12= 2^2 \times 3$ for any group of order 12. Let $n_3$ be the number of sylow-3 subgroups and let $n_2$ be the number of sylow 2 subgroups. We have by the third sylow theorem that $$n_3 | 4, n_3 \equiv 1 \mod 3$$
$$n_2 | 3, n_2 \equiv 1 \mod 2$$ So the groups can have either 1 or 4 sylow 3 subgroups of order 3, and either 1 or 3 sylow 2 subgroups of order 4. Furthermore coprime sylow-p groups only share the identity element in common, so we can rule out 4 sylow-3 groups and 3 sylow-2 groups, as the presence of either rules out the existence of a single copy of the other. Now we have established our groups must have a SINGLE sylow 2 subgroup, and a SINGLE sylow 3 subgroup, and that means that each is a normal subgroup of the entire group. The sylow-2 subgroup can be either $\Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_2$ or $\Bbb{Z}_4$. And the sylow-3 subgroup has a single contender $\Bbb{Z}_3$. Naturally then we can list out two groups $$\Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_2 \times \Bbb{Z}_3$$
$$\Bbb{Z}_4 \times \Bbb{Z}_3$$ But now the question remains, how to discover any remaining groups, and show that the remaining set covers all possible groups.a","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'sylow-theory']"

What do you think?  Thanks, The problem statement is: Consider the function $ f(z) = \sqrt {z\sin z}$ . Can $f(z)$ be defined near the origin as a single valued analytic function? What will be the radius of convergence of the power series expansion of $f$ around $z=0$? My thoughts: It is tempting to say ""no"", since $z=0$ seems like a branch point of $f(z)$. But a closer look at the function $$ f(z) = \sqrt {z\sin z} = e^{\large \frac{1}{2} \log z}e^{\large \frac{1}{2} \log\sin z}$$ shows that we need to pick two branch cuts.  And if we choose both cuts to  be $\mathbb R^- \cup \{0\}$, i.e., choose the principal branch of the logarithm for both factors, then each factor is discontinuous and not defined on the negative real axis (plus the origin), and each jumps by a factor of $e^{\frac{1}{2} 2 \pi i} = e^{i\pi} = -1$. However, considering both factors together, we get a total ""jump"" of $e^{2\pi i} =1$, and I think that now $f(z)$ has been made single-valued and analytic on the negative real axis, including the origin, and thus we get an analytic continuation onto the negative axis and the origin, so that $f(z)$ can in fact be defined near the origin as a single-valued analytic function. What do you think? This seems a bit too generous, though.  I feel like I have claimed that this function is entire , which I am almost certain cannot be true...because of the complex logarithm used to define $f(z)$. Any ideas are welcome.

1583985,Is Kaplansky's theorem for hereditary rings a characterization?,"This question came up during a first course on rings and modules I TA'd at. Kaplansky's Theorem for hereditary rings states that If $A$ is a hereditary ring, and $F$ is a free left $A$-module, then every submodule $M \subset F$ is isomorphic to a direct sum $\bigoplus_{i \in I} J_i$, where every $J_i$ is a left ideal of $A$. See for example Lam's Lectures on modules and rings , (2.24). Recently a student asked me for an example of a submodule of a free module that was not a direct sum of ideals, and the best I could come up with was the following: Let $A = \mathbb Z_4[X]/(X^2)$, and let $M = \langle (2,X) \rangle \subset A^2$; then $M$ is not isomorphic to a direct sum of ideals. My proof is long and tedious, and besides $A$ is very very far from being hereditary, since it has infinite global dimension. Hence the question: Can we find a simpler example of a submodule of a free module that is not isomorphic to a direct sum of ideals (say, over $\mathbb Z[X]$)? In fact, I was wondering if there are examples for all non-hereditary rings. is the converse of Kaplansky's theorem true? if a ring $A$ is such that all submodules of a free module are isomorphic to a direct sum of ideals, does it follow that $A$ is hereditary?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

1584134,Ways of characterizing sufficient statistics,"I've been reading a little about the Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem on my own, and I think I understand intuitively what a sufficient statistic is, but I am wondering what the convention is for formally defining it. Is it true that, for a given collection of iid samples ($\vec{x}$) from a distribution $X$, the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^t$ depends exclusively on $T(\vec{x})$ and not on other factors such as the number of elements in the sample? If that is the case, does it make sense to take the following as a definition of sufficiency. (Maximum likelihood estimates given $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ are equal iff $T(\vec{x}) = T(\vec{y})$). $$
\forall
{
     \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \text{Seq}[\mathbb{R}]:
} 
     \left(

 \Longleftrightarrow
      T(\vec{x}) = T(\vec{y})
$$ So this definition, while closer to right, is also wrong. Based on the comments below, the above definition inappropriately rejects all sufficient statistics except for the maximum likelihood estimate itself. For instance, the sum is a sufficient statistic for the mean in a normal distribution with standard deviation 1: $\mathcal{N}(\mu, 1)$. Amending the formula above gives us:
$$
\forall
{
     \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n:

(1) $\mathcal{N}(E(n))-E(n)\ \in \{1,\Bbb P\}$ . (2) $E(n)-\mathcal{P}(E(n))\ \in \{1,\Bbb P\}$ . It is based in the same idea as the Fortunate Numbers , to know more about the reasons why I did the test please check here (longer explanation).
I tried several combinations, but the following one seems to work properly so far and is not related with factorials or primorials, so I believe it would be easier to test: $E(n)$ ={ $m$ whose $\sigma_1(m)$ value is the $n^{th}$ element of the Record value sequence of $\sigma_1(m)$ (sum of divisors of m) ( A034885 )}$ ""Record values"" are defined as the subset of values $\sigma_1(m)$ of the set of sum of divisors of $m \in \Bbb N$ who are bigger than any previous values of the set, up to that value $m$ , so it provides a strictly increasing set of values of $\sigma_1(m)$ . Those are exactly the values of OEIS A034885 $(1,3,4,7,12,15,18,28,31,39,42...)$ . And they are exactly (thanks to @Ivan Neretin for the suggestion in the answers!) the Highly Abundant Numbers sequence (OEIS A002093 ): $\{1,2,3,4,6,8,10,12,16,18,20,24,30,36,42,48...\}$ The point is that tested almost up to $10^{27}$ both the distances of those elements $E(n)$ to the previous and following closer primes (when there is a previous positive prime) is also a prime number or $1$ . Here is a sample PARI/GP code able to check easily up to $10^9$ : testlimit = 10^9;n=1;exitval=0;prevsumdiv=0;while((n<testlimit) && (exitval==0),dj=divisors(n);sum_div=0;for(t=1,length(dj),sum_div=sum_div+dj[t]);while(sum_div<=prevsumdiv,sum_div=0;n=n+1;dj=divisors(n);for(t=1,length(dj),sum_div=sum_div+dj[t]));prevsumdiv = sum_div;np=nextprime(n+1);npmn=np-n;pp=precprime(n-1);nmpp=n-pp;if((nmpp==1 || isprime(nmpp)) && (npmn==1 || isprime(npmn)), print(""n= "",n,"" sigma1(n)= "",sum_div,"" N(n)= "",np,"" N(n)-n= "", npmn ,"" P(n)= "",pp,"" n-P(n)= "", nmpp);,exitval=1;)); After that point, I have been able to reduce the expression. It is possible to use instead of $\sigma_1(m)$ a reduced version of the sum of divisors, I will call it $\sigma_e(m)$ defined as the sum of the even composite divisors of $m$ not including $m$ itself in case of being even. In other words, it is the sum of divisors not including the sum of the prime numbers that are divisors, odd divisors, $1$ and $m$ itself. $E(n)$ is: $E(n)$ ={ $m$ whose $\sigma_e(m)$ value is the $n^{th}$ element of the Record value sequence of $\sigma_e(m)$ (sum of composite even divisors of m not including m in case of being even)}$ So it is not required to use A034885 anymore. Apart from this expression, I tried also using the sum of the prime divisors of $m$ , and other combinations of partial sums of the divisors of $m$ , including $1$ and $m$ itself, but those ones did not work. The even divisors seem to be the key. This is an example including the interval [1,99]. Please I would like to ask the following questions: Why does it happen? I can not imagine which possible reason is behind that property. Some insights would be very welcomed! Are there similar expressions based on other non-factorial functions? so far I have tried using the totient function and some sums of divisors of even numbers instead of $\sigma_e(n)$ , all of them unsuccessfully. I did not find any reference to this property, if it was already tested please I would like to know about it.
Thank you! Last update 2016/01/05 : amazingly $\forall h \in $ {Highly Abundant Numbers}, $h\gt3$ ,tested up to $10^{27}$ no counterexamples found, the closest prime number $p \lt h$ located to a distance $d=(h-p) \gt 1$ is also always at a prime distance, so $d \in \Bbb P$ . If the test is not wrong, these would mean that the even Highly Abundant Numbers greater than $2$ have always at least a Goldbach pair of primes. $h=p+d, p,d\in\Bbb P$","['conjectures', 'divisor-sum', 'prime-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'elementary-number-theory']"

1584220,Let $f: \Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ be a differentiable function such that $\sup_{x \in \Bbb R}|f'(x)| \lt \infty$. Then,"(UGC CSIR-2015, DECEMEMBER, MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES) $f$ maps a bounded sequence to a bounded sequence. $f$ maps a Cauchy sequence to a Cauchy sequence. $f$ maps a convergent sequence to a convergent sequence. $f$ is uniformly continuous. I choose all of the options as possible answers because the condition $\sup_{x\in \Bbb R}|f'(x)| \lt \infty$ forces $f$ to be uniformly continuous.(Because $f$ becomes Lipschitz and Lipschitz condition implies uniform continuity) i.e. $\frac {|f(x)-f(y)|}{|x-y|} \le \sup_{x\in \Bbb R}|f'(x)|$
$ \forall x,y$. Hence all other options are bound to be true. Am I correct?","['real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences', 'functions', 'uniform-continuity', 'convergence-divergence']"
