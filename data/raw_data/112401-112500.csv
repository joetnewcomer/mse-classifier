1629323,Volume enclosed by $(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2=x$,"I need to calculate the volume of solid enclosed by the surface $(x^2+y^2+z^2)^2=x$, using only spherical coordinates. My attempt: by changing coordinates to spherical: $x=r\sin\phi\cos\theta~,~y=r\sin\phi\sin\theta~,~z=r\cos\phi$ we obtain the Jacobian $J=r^2\sin\phi$. When $\phi$ and $\theta$ are fixed, $r$ varies from $0$ to $\sqrt[3]{\sin\phi\cos\theta}$ (because $r^4=r\sin\phi\cos\theta$). Keeping $\theta$ fixed, we let $\phi$ vary from $0$ to $\pi$. Thus the volume equals: $$V=\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\pi}\int\limits_{0}^{\sqrt[3]{\sin\phi\cos\theta}}r^2\sin\phi ~dr ~d\phi ~d\theta=0$$

1629357,2 is a square modulo $p$ if and only if $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 8$,"2 is a square modulo $p$ if and only if $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 8$ The indication for this exercise was to consider $\alpha$ such that $\alpha^8 = 1$ ($\alpha$ is eigth root of the unity) in a field extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$ and consider $y = \alpha + \alpha^{-1}$. I have got the part that if $p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 8$, then $2$ is a square modulo 8. I showed that $y^2 = 2$ (this is because $\alpha^8 = 1 \Rightarrow \alpha^4 = -1 \Rightarrow \alpha^2 = -\alpha^{-2}$. Then I used the proposition that if $\mathbb{K}$ is a field extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$, then $\mathbb{F_p} = \{x \in \mathbb{K} | x^p = x\}$ and I showed $y^p = y$ (easy in caracteristic $p$). Edit 2: $y^p = y$ is shown as follows:
$$\begin{align*} y^p &= \alpha^p + \alpha^{-p} & \text{every other terms vanish as we work in car $p$} \\
 & =\alpha^{8n \pm 1} + \alpha^{-8n \mp 1} & p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 8 \text{ by hypothesis}\\
&= (\alpha^8)^{n} \alpha^{\pm 1} + (\alpha^8)^{-n}\alpha^{\mp 1} & \alpha^8 = 1\\
&= \alpha^{\pm1} + \alpha^{\mp 1}\\
&= y.
\end{align*}$$
This shows that $2$ is a square modulo $p$, as $y^2 = 2$ and $y \in \mathbb{F}_p$. Now I have some troubles for the other part, I don't know where to start and what to do. Edit: While searching on google for help, I fell on quadratic residues, and I don't know what they are, we did not see them in class.","['number-theory', 'elementary-number-theory']"
1629401,Show by combinatorial argument that ${2n\choose 2} = 2{n \choose 2} + n^2$,"So i was given this question. Show by combinatorial argument that ${2n\choose 2} = 2{n \choose 2} + n^2$ Here is my solution: Given $2n$ objects, split them into $2$ groups of $n$, $A$ and $B$. $2$-combinations can either be assembled both from $A$, both from $B$ or one from each. There are ${n \choose 2}$ from $A$ and ${n \choose 2}$ from $B$. For the mixed pair, each choice from $A$ can be coupled with $n$ choices from $B$ so the total is $n^2$. Therefore ${2n\choose 2} = 2{n \choose 2} + n^2$ Is this correct. Is there any other combinatoric proof to solve this?","['combinatorics', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1629604,Variety of proofs of a simple proposition in arithmetic,"I have a couple of simple proofs of a simple proposition and I'm curious to see the variety of different approaches others would take to prove the same thing. Definition: The dilation of a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3,\ldots$ by a factor $n$ is the sequence $b_1,b_2,b_3,\ldots$ for which
$$
\begin{cases}
b_{kn} = a_k & \text{for } k=1,2,3,\ldots, \\
b_j = 0 & \text{if $j$ is not a multiple of $n$.}
\end{cases}
$$
Thus the dilation of $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ by a factor of $3$ is
$$
0,\ 0,\ a_1,\ 0,\ 0,\ a_2,\ 0,\ 0,\ a_3,\ 0,\ 0,\ a_4,\ \ldots
$$
(This is not standard terminology as far as I know, so tell me if there's some standard name for this.) Now let $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ consist of an infinite sequence of repetitions of $1,0,0,0,1,0$ (a $\text{“}1\text{''}$ in the $1$st and $5$th positions and $\text{“}0\text{''s}$ elsewhere).  In other words $a_k$ is just the indicator that $k$ is coprime to $6$. Now start by letting $c$ be an infinite sequence of $0$s and proceed as follows: 1. Let $n$ be the smallest index for which $c_n=0$ (thus initially $n=1$); 2. Let the new value of $c$ be $(c + \text{the dilation of } a \text{ by } n)$ (where the occurrence of $c$ inside the round brackets is the value of $c$ we had at the end of step $1$.); 3. Go back to step $1$. This goes on forever. Proposition: This process converges to an infinite sequence of $1$s.  (Thus, we never add $1$ to any position that was not $0$.) As I said, I have a couple of simple proofs and I am curious to see the variety of different approaches others would take to prove the same thing.","['sequences-and-series', 'arithmetic']"

1629679,asymptotic behavior of the two sequences defining exponential function,"There are two definitions of exponential function: $$e^x=\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n=\lim_{n\to \infty} a_n \text{       ,}$$ where $$S_n=1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\dots+\frac{x^n}{n!}$$ and $$a_n=(1+\frac{x}{n})^n \text{   .}$$ Since the two sequence have the same limit, I guess they are somehow related and reflect different aspects of $e^x$. So my first question is: are there any relationships between $S_n$ and $a_n$? My other questions come from the following observations: When x is positive, obviously $S_n$ is increasing. Is $a_n$ also increasing? When x is negative, $S_n$ goes up and down since it keeps adding numbers of alternating signs as as $n$ grows. Eventually $S_n$ ""squeezes"" to its limit. What about the behavior of $a_n$ in this case? When $n$ is smaller than $|x|$, I can see that $a_n$ changes signs very often. When $n$ is large, $a_n$ is always positive, and is $a_n$ increasing when $n$ is large?","['real-analysis', 'exponential-function', 'limits']"
1629688,What integers are coprime to the first $x$ prime numbers?,"I have noticed that there is a very specific pattern to numbers that are coprime to $2$, it is simply all of the odd numbers.  More specifically, it is in the following pattern, where $n$ is an integer: $$2n+1$$ For numbers that are coprime to the first $2$ prime numbers, $2$ and $3$ (or $6$), it is given as: $$6n\pm1$$ And upon analyzing this, I found an equivalent expression: $$6n\pm p_i$$ Where $p_i$ is the $i^{th}$ prime number greater than $2$ or $3$.  You can check this using modular arithmetic. When considering a pattern to numbers that are coprime to the first $3$ prime numbers, I get the following: $$30n\pm p_i$$ In fact, I have found that there is a particular $p_i$ which satisfies the entire problem for each problem, as we see $5$ satisfies $p_i$ for the first $2$ prime numbers problem.  In fact, $6n\pm5$ will never produce numbers that aren't coprime to the first $2$ prime numbers and never misses any numbers that are. For the first 3 prime numbers, I note the following: $$15n\pm2^a$$ For any integer $n$ or $a$, $15n\pm2^a$ will always be coprime to $2,3,5$ and there is no number it misses. And then going back, I realize this also implies $3n\pm2^a$ is also coprime to $2$ and $3$. In fact, I found that the following two expressions represent all numbers that are coprime to the first $x$ prime numbers: $$\Pi_{v=1}^xp_vn\pm p_i$$ $$\frac{\Pi_{v=1}^xp_v}2n\pm2^a$$ And the second one reduces since $p_1=2$: $$\Pi_{v=2}^xp_vn\pm2^a$$ Though I cannot construct a proof as to why such occurs.  Could someone explain why these two expressions manage to produce all numbers that are coprime to the first $x$ prime numbers and no numbers that aren't coprime?","['number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

Since $|b_i - b_j| \leq \sum_{k=i}^j \frac{1}{2^k}$ supposing $j \geq i$, the sequence $(b_n)$ is Cauchy and converges to some $b$.

\int_{[0,1]} |\chi_{[0,b]} - \chi_{[0,b_n]}| \mathrm{d}\lambda 
= |b_n - b|

Here's what I've been thinking so far: Let's bring $2016$ down to its prime factorized form, such that we have $2016 = 2^5\times3^2\times7^1$. Because the solution may include negative integers, note that a pair or 4 integers will form positive numbers, therefore we have $C(4,2)$ OR $C(4,4)$ ways of doing this. Let's also note that the solution may include 1s in $3, 2, 1$, or $0$ positions for $(x_i)$, such that we have $C(4,3), C(4,2), C(4,1)$, or $C(4,0)$.

1630068,Is It Always Possible to Cross a Surface Exactly Once?,"Yesterday, in my physics class, the following question arose: Is there a closed surface embedded in $\mathbb R^3$ dividing space into two connected components such that all paths from one component to the other cross the surface multiple times? Note that one can safely replace ""closed surface"" with ""topological sphere"" if they like, since this question concerns only the local properties of the surface, not the global structure. You can see that by noting that, if a path with exactly one crossing exists, then it can be restricted to some neighborhood of the crossing and still be a path from one component to the other, crossing the surface once (that is, the path should being within the surface and end outside, and have exactly one point on the surface).

1630222,Determinant from Paul Garrett's Definition of the Characteristic Polynomial.,"$\DeclareMathOperator{\id}{id} \DeclareMathOperator{\End}{End}$ On pg. 390 of Paul Garrett's notes on Algebra, a definition for the characteristic polynomial is given, which I discuss here. Let $V$ be an $n$ -dimensional vector space over a field $F$ and let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$ . Consider the $F$ -module $M=F[x]\otimes_F V$ and give it an $F[x]$ -module structure by extending the scalars via the natural inclusion $F\to F[x]$ . Thus $M$ is a free $F[x]$ -module of rank $n$ . Now we can think of $1\otimes T-x\otimes \id_V$ as a member of $\End_{F[x]}(M)$ . Definition. The characteristic polynomial of $T$ is then defined as the unique polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ such that the $n$ -th exterior power map $$\Lambda^n_{F[x]}(1\otimes T-x\otimes \id_V):\Lambda^n_{F[x]} M\to \Lambda^n_{F[x]}M$$ is same as multiplication by $p(x)$ with the identity map on $\Lambda^n_{F[x]}M$ . On the other hand, the following is well known: Definition. Let $\lambda\in F$ is a scalar in $F$ , we have a linear operator $T-\lambda I$ on $V$ , whose determinant is defined as the unique scalar $\theta\in F$ such that the map $$\Lambda^n_F (T-\lambda I):\Lambda^n_F V\to \Lambda^n_F V$$ is $\theta$ times the identity map on $V$ . Question. How do we see that $\det(T-\lambda I)=p(\lambda)$ under the above definitions. I have a feeling that this should be rather straightforward from the definitions but I can't see it.

This is pretty close to using exactness on the sequence $0 \to \mathfrak{a} \to R \to R/\mathfrak{a} \to 0$, except now we're localizing $R/\mathfrak{a}$ with respect to $\bar{D}$, not just tensoring it with $D^{-1}R$.

1630445,Adjoint to $\mathsf{Proj}$? - A quest to understand categories of graded objects.,"I've been having a hard time with graded objects in algebraic geometry for some time. Lately I realized a lot of my difficulties come from not having any idea at all of where graded objects live. Having no idea what category they come from I am forced to swallow a lot of ad hoc constructions which are hard to internelize. So I decided to attack these core issues. Alas, I can't seem to find a source which treats the basics of categories of graded modules/algebras. I didn't find even the basic definition for a category in either cases. Here's what I have so far: Rings can be viewed as monoids in $\mathsf{Ab}$, modules are modules over monoids and algebras are monoids in the category of modules. This statement generalizes imediately to the category of graded abelian groups. The jist here (from what i've been able to gather) is we have (at least?) two choices for the braiding  in the symmetric monoidal category of graded abelian groups (kozul sign rule). I'm still having trouble though with the down to earth understanding. Here are couple of questions: How well behaved is the subcategory of positively/non-negatively graded modules/algebras? What is the graded tensor product? (pushout of graded algebras). Is the category of graded modules over a graded algebra abelian? Is graded localization of modules/rings/ algebras universal in some sense? Is the $\mathsf{Proj}$ functor adjoint to something? If so what equivalence of subcategories does it induce?

Then by our definitions of even and odd numbers, we know that integers m and n exist so that a = 2m and b = 2n+1 . This means: a+b = (2m)+(2n+1) = 2(m+n)+1 = 2c+1 where c=m+n is an integer by the closure property of addition.

Proposition: For all sets $A, B$ and $C$, $A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$ Proof: We must show that $A \cap (B - C) = (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$.  To do so, we must prove that $A \cap (B - C) \subseteq (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$ and $(A \cap B) - (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B - C)$. Part 1: Suppose that x is any element in $A \cap (B - C)$. We must prove that $A \cap (B - C) \subseteq (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$ By the definition of intersection and the definition of set difference, $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ and $x \notin C$. Since $x \in A$ and $x \in B$, $x \in (A \cap B)$ Since $x \notin C$, then $x \notin (A \cap C)$ Therefore, since $x \in (A \cap B)$ and $x \notin (A \cap C)$, $x \in (A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$ Part 2: Suppose that $x$ is any element in $(A \cap B) - (A \cap C)$. We must prove that $(A \cap B) - (A \cap C) \subseteq A \cap (B - C)$ Since $x \in (A \cap B)$, by the definition of intersection, $x \in A$ and $x \in B$. Since $x \notin (A \cap C)$, by the definition of set difference, we know that $x \notin C$. Since $x \in A$ and $x \in B$ and $x \notin C$, then $x \in A \cap (B - C)$.

  $i$. That is, $X_i \subset U \cup V$. However, $X_i$ intersects both $U$ and $V$ , since $X_i  \cap A\neq ∅$ and $X_i \cap B \neq ∅$. This contradicts the assumption that $X_i$
  is connected. Can someone please elaborate on some of the details of the proof? 1) Why bother finding open sets containing $A,B$ and how do we know that they even exist?

The process is stationary. $E[W_t]= 0, \forall t$ The hint for the exercise is: Consider $E[(W_t^{(N)}-W_s^{(N)})^2]$ where: $$W_t^{(N)}=(-N)\vee(N\wedge W_t)$$ From what I understand, this means that the modified process is $-N$ if the original process is smaller than $-N$, it is equal to the original process, if the original process is between $-N$ and $N$, and it is $N$ if the original process is bigger than $N$. Basically we bound the absolute value. Now I will try to solve the exercise by contradiction. We get $E[(W_t^{(N)}-W_s^{(N)})^2]=2E[(W_t^{(N)})^2]$, since the expected value of each is 0, and they are independent. But $W_t^{(N)}$ is 0 iff  $W_t$ is 0, so $E[(W_t^{(N)})^2]$  can not be 0, because then $W_t$
 would be 0 a.s. and then we would only have a trivial process. Notice that stationarity gives that $E[(W_t^{(N)}-W_s^{N})^2]=2E[(W_t^{(N)})^2]$ must be constant no matter what s is. Now look at $E[(W_t^{(N)}-W_{t+1/N}^{(N)})^2]$ for $\omega$ fixed we will get N is bigger than $W_t(\omega)$ at some $N$, assuming for contradiction continuity of the path, it will happen in a neighbourhood around $W_t(\omega)$ the neighbourhood is if we hold $\omega$ fixed, it is a neighborhood in the time-parameter. Then the assumed continuity gives that we get a pointwise limit to $0$. Now, if I could move the limit outside the integral. I would get a contradiction, because then we would must have that $E[(W_t^{(N)}-W_{t+1/N}^N)^2]\rightarrow 0$. But we showed above that this is a constant value, which has to be above $0$, or else the process is trivial. Can you please help me finish the proof?

What I have tried: claim: $X = \bigcup_{x\in X} \{ x \}$ indeed, $\{x \} \subset X ;\forall x$ hence $ \bigcup_x \{x \} \subset X$. Suppose $y \in X$ then here I am stuck - is it OK to write that $y \sim y$ so $y \in \{y \}$? I am not sure I can do that, but if I could it would finish the proof.

1631284,"$20$ people sit at a round table, how many ways can we choose $3$ with no $2$ being neighbors?","My thought process to this problem was as follows:
$1st$ move you have $20$ choices, when you pick you eliminate $3$ people, the first person and their two neighbors. The $2nd$ move you have $20-3$ people to choose from so $17$. And so on. Does: $20 \cdot 17 \cdot 14$ make sense as an answer?","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"
1631300,Must this rng be a ring?,"A rng is a ring without the assumption that the ring contains an identity. Consider a finite rng $\mathbf{R}$. I am investigating conditions that get close forcing an identity but not quite. The closest condition I can think of is the following: If $a\in \mathbf{R}$ is non-zero then there is $b\in\mathbf{R}$ such that $ab\neq
 0$ I am finding myself unable to prove that $\mathbf{R}$ must/need-not have a multiplicative identity i.e. be a ring. Are there well-known results/examples that deal with this sort of condition?","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'rngs']"

1631375,Sequence $\left(\frac{k^n}{2^k}\right)$ convergence through epsilon proof.,"Prove that, for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
  $$\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k^n}{2^k} = 0$$
  using an $\epsilon-$proof. As scratchwork, I've gotten to
$$\left|\frac{k^n}{2^k} - 0\right| = \frac{k^n}{2^k}\leq \epsilon$$ but I don't know how to get farther. I understand that if I can find a way to solve for k as a ""function"" of epsilon, then I can complete the proof. This is the part that I'm stuck on. We don't have many tools available yet, since we have only established the rational numbers and the concept of sequence convergence.","['real-analysis', 'limits', 'epsilon-delta', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series']"
1631396,What is the difference between disjoint union and union?,"If $S = A \cup B$, then $S$ is the collection of all points in $A$ and $B$ What about $S = A \sqcup B$?, I think disjoint union is the same as union, only $A, B$ are disjoint. So the notation is a bit misleading. Because it is not a new operation, but operation where the pair $A,B$ satisfies $A \cap B = \varnothing$. So given $A \cap B = \varnothing$, $S = A \sqcup B = A \cup B$. Is my interpretation correct?","['terminology', 'notation', 'elementary-set-theory']"

However, it can also be shown that the complex numbers cannot be made an ordered field. How can these two facts coincide?

1631437,Prove $\int_{0}^{x}f+\int_{0}^{f(x)}f^{-1}=xf(x)\qquad\text{for all $x\geq0$}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : The sum of integrals of a function and its inverse: $\int_{0}^{a}f+\int_{f(0)}^{f(a)}f^{-1}=af(a)$ (5 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Suppose that the function $f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and strictly increasing and that $f:(0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is differentiable. Moreover, assume $f(0)=0$. Consider the formula $$\int_{0}^{x}f+\int_{0}^{f(x)}f^{-1}=xf(x)\qquad\text{for all $x\geq0$}$$ Prove this formula. Attempt: Consider that $g(x)=\int_{0}^{x}f+\int_{0}^{f(x)}f^{-1}-xf(x)$ which is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Then differentiate $g(x)$, we have $g'(x)=f(x)+xf'(x)-f(x)-xf'(x)=0$. Thus for all $x$, $$g(x)-g(0)=0\Longrightarrow\int_{0}^{x}f+\int_{0}^{f(x)}f^{-1}-xf(x)=0$$ I am not sure my the equality valid not or not. If not, can someone give me a suggestion to modify the proof. Thanks.","['real-analysis', 'proof-verification']"
1631439,Proving positive definiteness of matrix $a_{ij}=\frac{2x_ix_j}{x_i + x_j}$,"I'm trying to prove that the matrix with entries $\left\{\frac{2x_ix_j}{x_i + x_j}\right\}_{ij}$ is positive definite for all n, where n is the number of rows/columns. I was able to prove it for the 2x2 case by showing the determinant is always positive. However, once I extend it to the 3x3 case I run into trouble. I found a question here whose chosen answer gave a condition for positive definiteness of the extended matrix, and after evaluating the condition and maximizing it via software, the inequality turned out to hold indeed, but I just can't show it. Furthermore, it would be way more complicated when I go to 4x4 and higher. I think I should somehow use induction here to show it for all n, but I think I'm missing something. Any help is appreciated. Edit: Actually the mistake is mine, turns out there are indeed no squares in the denominator, so it turns out user141614's first answer is what I really needed. Thanks a lot! Should I just accept this answer, or should it be changed back to his first answer then I accept it?","['matrices', 'positive-definite', 'linear-algebra']"
