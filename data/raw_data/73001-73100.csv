897939,On the square coeffecients of a modular form,"Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$. Let $f\in M_k(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)$ be a modular form of weight $k$ on $\Gamma_0(N)$ with a Dirichlet character $\chi$. 
If $f$ has a Fourier expansion of the form 
$$
f(\tau)=\sum_{n\in \mathbb{N}} a(n) q^n \qquad (q=e^{2\pi i }).
$$ Set $$F_f(\tau)=\sum_{\substack{n\in \mathbb{N}\\n=\square}} a(n) q^n$$ Question: is $F_f$ a modular form. If yes, which weight and level? Background: If $k\in \mathbb{Z}+\frac{1}{2}$, one can associate using Shimura lifting, to each Hecke eigenforms $f$ of weight $k$ a modular form $g$ of weight $2k-1$ such that 
$$
\lambda(f,l^2)=\lambda(g,l)
$$ 
where $\lambda(f,l^2),\lambda(g,l)$ are the Hecke-eigenvalues with respect to the operator $T(l^2),T(l)$. As we see, for normalized Hecke-eigenform $f$ the coefficient $a_f(l^2)$ are important in this case, since it is give us information about the corresponding coefficients $a_g(l)$. If $k\in \mathbb{Z}$, the situation not clear for me!. Bests.","['analytic-number-theory', 'modular-forms', 'number-theory']"

Suppose that: $A \subset X$ and that  $x$ is a limit point of $A$. Show that $f(x)$ is a limit point of $f(A)$ By a limit point $c$ of $B$ I mean that every neighborhood of $c$ intersects $B$ in a point $d$ such that $c\not = d$ What I have done is that: I supposed that $x$ is a limit point of $A$ but $x\not\in A$ and showed the required. but in the case when $x \in A$. My trial goes as follows: Suppose $W$ was a neighborhood of $f(x)$ so $f^{-1}(W) \text{is a neighborhood of } x$. So $ f^{-1}(W) \cap A \not=\emptyset$ because $x$ is a limit point of $A$. Say $y\in f^{-1}(W) \cap A$. So $f(y)\in A$ and $f(y)\in W$. Now, if  $x\not\in A$ then $f(x) \not\in f(A)$ but $f(y)\in A$ so $f(y)\not = f(x)$. So $W$ intersects $f(A)$ in a point $f(y)$ which is different of $f(x)$ If $x\in A$, it may happen that $f$ is not injective and happen that  $f(x)=f(y)$ in which case I can't show that f(x) is a limit point of $f(A)$.

I think it would be useful to let you know the definition of sub-net I am using: $\{y_e\}_{e \in E}$ is a subnet of $\{x_d\}_{d \in D}$ (where $D$ and $E$ are directed (filtered) sets) if and only if there is a function $f: E \to D$ that verifies the following two properties: $\forall d \in D$ there is $e' \in E$ such that for all $e\geq e'$, $f(e) \geq d$. 2.$\forall e \in E$, $y_e=x_{f(e)}$ Now, I've tried to show the statement straightforward but I couldn't. So maybe it is easier to show it by the absurd: Suppose $(x_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in \Lambda}$ doesn't converge to $x$. Then, there is some $U$ open with $x \in U$ such that for all $\alpha$, there is $\alpha'$ with $\alpha'\geq \alpha$ such that $x_{\alpha'} \not \in U$.

897971,Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ invertible complex matrix such that $A^7 = A^*$. Show that $A^8 = I$.,"Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ invertible complex matrix such that $A^7 = A^*$ (where $*$ denotes conjugate transpose). Show that $A^8 = I$. Here are my thoughts so far: I was able to show that all the eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy $\lambda^8 = 1$. I tried writing $A$ in Jordan canonical form $A = PJP^{-1}$ so that $A^* = (P^{-1})^*J^*P^*$ and $A^7 = PJ^7P^{-1}$. I was hoping to conclude $J^* = J^7$ but this isn't necessarily true as they may not be Jordan matrices; they would be if $J$ was diagonal, but if I knew that $J$ was diagonal, I would be done. As $A^{49} = (A^7)^7 = (A^*)^7 = (A^7)^* = (A^*)^* = A$, $A^{48} = I$ so the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $x^{48}-1$; note that $x^8 - 1$ is a factor of $x^{48}-1$. If $A^8 = PJP^{-1}$ is the Jordan normal form of $A^8$, then $J = I + N$ and $J^6 = I$ by the previous point so $(I+N)^6 = I$ but I can't directly deduce from this equality that $N = 0$. Any hints are very much appreciated.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

898071,Determining if a recursively defined sequence converges and finding its limit,"Define $\lbrace x_n \rbrace$ by $$x_1=1, x_2=3; x_{n+2}=\frac{x_{n+1}+2x_{n}}{3} \text{if} \, n\ge 1$$ The instructions are to determine if this sequence exists and to find the limit if it exists. I prove that the sequence is eventually decreasing and that it is bounded below (see work below). Hence, if my work is correct, the sequence will have a limit. The problem is that if the limit is, say, $L$ then it should satisfy $L=\frac{L+2L}{3}$; however, every real number satisfies the latter equality. So, if this limit exists, how do I actually find it? Proving the limit exists: 1) The sequence is bounded below by $1$.
Base Case: $x_1=1\ge 1$. Induction: Suppose $x_n\ge 1$ for all $k=1,\ldots ,n+1$. Then $x_{n+2}=\frac{x_{n+1}+2x_{n}}{3}\ge \frac{3}{3}=1$. 2) The sequence is eventually decreasing: It actually starts decreasing after the 4th term. So I take as my base case $x_5<x_4$.
Base Case: Note that $$x_3=\frac{x_2+2x_1}{3}=\frac{3+2}{3}=5/3$$ and hence $$x_4=\frac{x_{3}+2x_{2}}{3}=\frac{5/3+2\times3}{3}=23/9$$ so $$x_5=\frac{x_{4}+2x_{3}}{3}=\frac{23/9+2\times5/3}{3}=\frac{53}{27}<x_4$$ Induction: Suppose $x_{n}<x_{n-1}.$ Then $$x_{n+1}-x_n=\frac{x_{n}+2x_{n-1}}{3}-x_n \\=2\frac{x_{n-1}-x_n}{3}<0$$
Therefore, the sequence is bounded below and is eventually decreasing.","['recurrence-relations', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

If $\sum a_n$ is absolutely convergent, then $\sum \sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} = \sum a_n \sum b_n$ . I realized that this theorem can be generalized in the context of Banach space.

898152,Rolling parabola & catenary,"By rolling a rigid catenary on a straight line one obtains the locus of its center of curvature as a parabola. This is well known as the natural equation connecting arc length and radius of curvature is 
 $$ R = s^2/a + a $$ EDIT2: which for dynamic rolling we set: $$ s= x , R = y $$ to make its evolute re-appear as $$ y = x^2/ a + a. $$ EDIT1: In the central position the rigid catenary has the equation:  $\, y/ a = cosh (x/a) $ Likewise by rolling a rigid parabolic curve on a straight line do we get back a catenary locus?

898181,Families of Square Roots of Identity Matrices,"I just analysed this equation for real matrices
$$
A^2=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}^2=I
$$
From the main diagonal of $A^2$ we must have $a^2+bc=bc+d^2=1$ showing that $d=\pm a$. CASE 1: If $b=0$ we have $a^2=d^2=1$ so then $c=0$. If $c=0$ the same argument renders $b=0$. CASE 2: Otherwise assume $b,c\neq 0$. Then if $d=a$ the opposite diagonal of $A^2$ shows that $2ab=2ac=0$. Thus $a=d=0$ and the equation $a^2+bc=1$ yields $bc=1$. CASE 3: Now, if $d=-a$ we have $ab-ab=ac-ac=0$ which is always true, so then only the first equation $a^2+bc=1$ matters. So we have three sets of solutions: CASE 1: gives the four solutions $b=c=0$ and $a,d\in\{-1,1\}$. CASE 2: gives an infinite family of solutions $a=d=0$ and $b=x,c=x^{-1}$ with $x\in\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}$. CASE 3: gives a last family of solutions: choose $(x,y)\in\mathbb R\times\left(\mathbb R\setminus\{0\}\right)$ and define $a=x,d=-x$ and $b=y,c=(1-x^2)y^{-1}$. I find it interesting how the solutions divide nicely into advancing stages of first discrete, then one-dimensional, and finally two-dimensional parametrisations in this analysis. I wonder if that is purely a coincidence ... QUESTION: What would a similar analysis of $A^2=I$ where we are dealing with $3\times 3$ matrices look like?

898251,Determinant of a standard magic square,"What is the lowest positive, what the highest possible value for the determinant of a standard-magic-square-matrix of order $n$ ? Are there singular standard-magic-square-matrices of any order greater than $3$ ? First of all, the determinant of a standard-magic-square-matrix must be a multiple of $\frac{n^2(n^2+1)}{2}$ for odd $n$ . This follows easily by the following process: Add all the columns to the last column. Then every entry in the last column is $\frac{n(n^2+1)}{2}$ ,the constant of the standard-magic-square. Now extract this constant and add all the rows to the last one. Then every entry in the last row is again the constant, beside the last entry, which is $n$ . Since $n$ is for odd n a divisor of the constant, it can be extracted as well. For even $n$ , only $\frac{n}{2}$ can be extracted, so the determinant is only a multiple of $\frac{n^2(n^2+1)}{4}$ . This gives lower bounds for the absolute value of the determinant of regular magic-square-matrices. For size $3$ , the only possible determinant (ignoring the sign) is $360$ . For size $4$ , my personal minimum for the absolute non-zero determinant is $2176$ and my maximum is $17408$ . For size $5$ , my best results are $325$ and $6\ 547\ 775$ . For sizes $4$ and $5$ , I also found matrices with determinant $0$ , but for $n = 6$ I found none. OEIS claims that the magic square of order $6$ produced by Matlab has determinant $0$ (By the way, the sequence seems to contain a typo because in the list $-360$ appears for $n=2$ instead of $n=3$ ). My pascal program generating random magic squares did not find a magic square with order $6$ and determinant $0$ .

Motivation : Finite extensions must have finite automorphism groups since they are algebraic, so you can write $K/F$ as $K = F(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n)$ and using the minimal polynomials of the generators we deduce the finiteness of the group $G$, so in this case the transcendence degree is always zero if $G$ is finite.

For this choice of points, we also have $z \mapsto z$, $z \mapsto -z$, and $z \mapsto -\frac{1}{z}$, so $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2 \leq \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{-1, 0, 1\})$. Furthermore, for any $a, b, c$ on a straight line, we can conjugate by a rotation, a translation, and a rescaling to get a corresponding subgroup. If I had to guess, the group will depend on whether or not $a, b, c$ are collinear. Any hints on how to proceed would be very much appreciated.",['complex-analysis']

Hardy, Ramanujan gave the following sum $$\dfrac{1}{1^{7}\cosh\left(\dfrac{\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)} - \dfrac{1}{3^{7}\cosh\left(\dfrac{3\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)} + \dfrac{1}{5^{7}\cosh\left(\dfrac{5\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)} - \cdots = \frac{\pi^{7}}{23040}\tag{1}$$ or using $\sum $ notation $$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \dfrac{(-1)^{n}}{(2n + 1)^{7}\cosh\left(\dfrac{(2n + 1)\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)} = \frac{\pi^{7}}{23040}$$ Since $\cosh y = (e^{y} + e^{-y})/2$ we can see that the sum is equal to $$S = 2\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{n}\exp\left(-\dfrac{(2n + 1)\pi\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{(2n + 1)^{7}\left\{1 + \exp\left(-(2n + 1)\pi\sqrt{3}\right)\right\}}$$ Putting $$q = \exp\left(-\pi\sqrt{3}\right)$$ we get the sum as $$S = 2\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}q^{n + 1/2}}{(2n + 1)^{7}(1 + q^{2n + 1})}$$ We can then use $$\dfrac{q^{n + 1/2}}{1 + q^{2n + 1}} = \frac{q^{n + 1/2} - q^{3(n + 1/2)}}{1 - q^{4n + 2}}$$ and hope to use the Ramanujan functions $P, Q, R$ given by $$P(q) = 1 - 24\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{nq^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\
Q(q) = 1 + 240\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{3}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}\\
R(q) = 1 - 504\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{5}q^{2n}}{1 - q^{2n}}$$ to calculate the sum $S$ in terms of $P, Q, R$. However the stumbling block is the term $(2n + 1)^{7}$ appearing in the denominator. Therefore I am not sure if the functions $P, Q, R$ can be used in the evaluation of sum $S$. Please let me know if there are any other approaches to calculate the sum $S$. Update : While going through Ramanujan's Notebooks Vol 3 (by Bruce C. Berndt) I found the proof for the above sum. But he uses a highly non-obvious formula (also discovered by Ramanujan) $$\frac{u^{6n}}{\cos u\cos(\omega u)\cos(\omega^{2}u)} = 12\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\dfrac{(-1)^{k}\left\{\left(k + \dfrac{1}{2}\right)\pi\right\}^{6n + 5}}{\left[\left\{\left(k + \dfrac{1}{2}\right)\pi\right\}^{6} - u^{6}\right]\cosh\left\{\left(k + \dfrac{1}{2}\right)\pi\sqrt{3}\right\}}\tag{2}$$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Berndt goes on to say that Ramanujan probably obtained this formula $(2)$ via partial fractions and says that it can be obtained by a routine procedure with somewhat lengthy calculation. The method of partial fractions is used to express a rational function (for the purpose of integrating them) in the form of a sum of finite terms which can be integrated via standard formulas. I am nor sure how that could be extended to any general function (which is not rational) and thereby produce a series. Berndt says ""the sum $(1)$ can be obtained by putting $n = 0$ in $(2)$ and then equating coefficients of $u^{6}$ on both sides"". This part requires some reasonable amount of calculation, but it is not so difficult. I want to understand the technique of partial fractions as applied to general functions (may be with some requirement of continuity and differentiability) and its proper justification so that I can provide a proof of formula $(2)$ for myself and thereby have a complete proof of the Ramanujan's sum $(1)$.",['sequences-and-series']

The reason I am asking this is that if we have a function $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, then clearly $\int \limits_{X \times Y} |f| \,d\lambda < \infty$.  But we can say $f = f\chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} }$, where $\chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} }$ is the characteristic function of $ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \}$. Since the two functions are equal, we get that $\int \limits_{X \times Y} |f| \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X \times Y} |f\chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} }| \,d\lambda = \int \limits_{X \times Y} |f| \,d( \chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda)$. This means that $f \in L^{1}(d( \chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda))$. But my professor said that the measure $\chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda$ is a $\sigma$-finite measure, but not necessarily a product measure .  What does that mean?  Why can we integrate with it over $X \times Y$ if it is not a product measure? Does it possibly mean that the measure is not necessarily defined on the product $\sigma$-algebra?  This measure is defined on the product $\sigma$-algebra, so that can't be it... Note that if $E \in \overline{\Sigma \times \tau}$, then the measure of $E$ with respect to $\chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda$ is defined to be $\int \limits_{E} \chi_{ \{ (x,y) \mid f(x,y) \neq 0 \} } \,d\lambda$.","['measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

The question is motivated by a result that we can find a pseudo-differential operator $S$ of order $-l$ such that $SL - I = K$ continuously maps compactly supported distributions to smooth functions. This would seem to imply we can prove a form of the above estimate by writing $$u = SLu - Ku$$ Then using the continuity of inclusions $H^r \to \mathcal{E}' = \mathcal{D}'$ (compactness of $M$ key here) and $C^\infty \to H^{s+l}$ to bound the latter term, and the operator norm of $S$ to bound the former.

I have seen this apllied to vector spaces/modules-used in tensor product definition. Thanks","['terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"
900513,Looking for a smooth curve that is not rational,"I am preparing for an exam in (mostly classical) algebraic geometry, and I have some preparatory questions, among which: Can you write the equations of any nonsingular curve in any projective space which is not rational? A problem with this question is that we never really defined what a ""rational curve"" is in class, but from what I can understand looking around, it should be a curve which is birationally equivalent to $\mathbb{CP}^1$. I have found this beautiful answer on MO, saying that cubic curves are an example since they have genus $1$ and $\mathbb{CP}^1\cong S^2$ has genus $0$. However, if I'm not mistaken, this relies on the fact that two smooth curves are birational iff they are isomorphic, which we didn't see in class. Is there some simple (and simple to prove) example for this question?",['algebraic-geometry']
900541,Implementing trig functions for dual numbers,"I'm curious, how do common trig functions get implemented for dual numbers? One way would be to use the power series definition, but that seems inefficient","['numerical-linear-algebra', 'derivatives', 'abstract-algebra']"
900550,Union of subgroups is subgroup,"I am doing an exercise where I am asked to prove or disprove the statement: If $G$ is a group, and $H_1,H_2,H_3$ and $H_1 \cup H_2 \cup H_3$ are subgroups of $G$ then $\exists i,j$ with $i \neq j$ such that $H_i \subset H_j$. In the same exercise, I've already prove that this statement is true in the case union of two subgroups is a subgroup. I have no idea how to show this statement holds for this case and I couldn't think of a counterexample. Any suggestions would be appreciated.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
900553,Is there an easy way to find the sign of the determinant of an orthogonal matrix?,"I just learned that if a matrix is orthogonal, its determinant can only be valued 1 or -1. Now, if I were presented with a large matrix where it would take a lot of effort to calculate its determinant, but I know it's orthogonal, is there a simpler way to find out whether the determinant is positive or negative than the standard way of calculating the determinant?","['orthogonality', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'computational-complexity', 'determinant']"
900557,"""Practical"" Claim about Hypothesis Testing of Bernoulli Distribution Parameter","First, let me state the original problem (in my own wording): Describe the decision procedure for testing the hypothesis about the parameter $p$ (success rate) of a Bernoulli distribution. The hypotheses are \begin{gather}
H_0: p = p_0 \\
H_1: p \ne p_0
\end{gather} where $p_0$ is a fixed number. If $Y = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$, where $X_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ are i.i.d., is available, describe the decision procedure based on $Y$ that will guarantee that the probability of type 1 error does not exceed $\alpha$. (Assume $n$ is large.) The first solution without the assumption that $n$ is large: Find two critical values $Y_{lower}$ and $Y_{upper}$ such that $P(Y_{lower} < U < Y_{upper}) = 1 - \alpha$, where $U \sim \text{Binomial}(p_0, n)$. (There are many possible choices.) We accept $H_0$ if $Y_{lower} < Y < Y_{upper}$. Then if $n$ is assumed large and we are allowed to approximate the distribution of $Y$ with a normal distribution, the method simplifies to Find two critical values $Z_{lower}$ and $Z_{upper}$ such that $P(Z_{lower} < U < Z_{upper}) = 1 - \alpha$ where $U \sim \mathcal N(0, 1)$. We accept $H_0$ if $Z_{lower} < Z < Z_{upper}$, where $Z = \sqrt{n}\frac{(Y/n) - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}}$. This simplifies the problem slightly if we take the symmetric interval around the mean, i.e., $Z_{lower} = -Z_{upper}$. Here comes my question: I was told by a teacher that in practice , some people use
$$
\tilde Z = \sqrt n \frac{(Y/n) - p_0}{\sqrt{(Y/n)(1 - (Y/n))}}
$$
instead of $Z$. In other words, $p_0$ in the denominator of $Z = \sqrt{n}\frac{(Y/n) - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}}$ is replaced by $\hat p = \frac{Y}{n}$. His explanation was that $\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}$ might not be representative of the true variance, and the sample variance $\sqrt{\hat p(1 - \hat p)}$ may be better. I don't think this reasoning is valid because we are testing the hypothesis! However, after some reflection, I am starting to think that using $\tilde Z$ might not be such a wrong thing because we did employ the central limit approximation, and using $\tilde Z$ might correct the approximation in a proper way. Of course this would somewhat contradict the assumption that the problem allows you to use normal approximation, but is this kind of correction (if it's really a correction) valid to some degree? Why I think it might be correction in the right direction: Suppose $\frac 12 < \hat p < p_0$. Then $\sqrt{\hat p(1 - \hat p)} > \sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)}$, so $Z < \tilde Z < 0$, making it more probable to accept $H_0$ using $\tilde Z$ than $Z$. On the other hand, if $\frac 12 < p_0 < \hat p$, it becomes less probable to accept $H_0$ using $\tilde Z$.","['statistics', 'hypothesis-testing', 'central-limit-theorem', 'soft-question', 'probability']"
