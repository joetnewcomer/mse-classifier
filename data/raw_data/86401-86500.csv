1144959,Biholomorphic map from a disk to its quarter,"Could you tell me how to find a biholomorphic map from a unit disk $D$ to $\{ |z|<1 \ : \ \Re z >0, \ \Im z >0 \}$? I know that mapping of the form : $\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ won't work. Also, we can map the quarter of the disk to upper half of the disk by $f(z) = z^2$. Then, using the map $g(z)= \frac{z-1}{z+1}$ we map  $Q:= \{ 0< \arg z < \frac{\pi}{2}\}$ to $D_+$ the  upper half of the unit disk. So $g^{-1}$ maps $D_+$ to $Q$ And $\varphi (z) = \frac{iz^2+1}{iz^2-1}: \ Q \rightarrow D$ Will this mapping work? $f^{-1} \circ g \circ \varphi ^{-1} (z)$","['conformal-geometry', 'complex-analysis']"

1145034,What are the commutative quasigroups satisfying $a/b=b/a$?,"There's a harder question lurking behind this question that was just asked. The context is quasigroup theory. A commutative quasigroup can be defined as a set $Q$ together with commutative binary operation $*$ such that for all $a,b \in Q$, there is a unique ""solution"" $s \in Q$ solving $s*a=b$. We write $b/a$ for the unique such $s$. The linked question (essentially) asks if there exists a commutative quasigroup satisfying the identity $a/b=b/a$. (Yes, for example $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ has this property with respect to addition.)

1145195,Approximation of a strongly measurable function by a sequence of simple functions.,"Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and let $E$ be a normed space. $(i)$ $f:X \rightarrow E$ is called Borel measurable if $f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal A$ for all $B \in \mathcal{Bo}(E)$ where $\mathcal{Bo}(E)$ is the $\sigma-algebra$ generated by the metric topology on $E$ . $(ii)$ $f:X \rightarrow E$ is called strongly measurable if $f$ is Borel measurable and $f(X)$ , the range of $f$ , is a separable subset of $E$ . $(iii)$ $f:X \rightarrow E$ is called a simple function if $f$ has a finite range. Lemma. Let $(X, \mathcal{A})$ be a measurable space and let $E$ be a Banach space. Let $f:X \rightarrow E$ be a simple function. Then $f$ is strongly measurable $\Leftrightarrow$ $f$ is Borel measurable. In the light of the above lemma, my question is the following: A New Question: How to prove the statement labeled as (1) in the proof of the proposition in the image? In the underlined area in the image below, how did the author conclude that each $f_{n}$ is Borel measurable? The underlined part is already answered in a another question. $\quad$ Proposition E.2. $\quad$ Let $(X,\mathscr A)$ be a measurable space, let $E$ be a Banach space, and let $f:X\to E$ be strongly measurable. Then there is a sequence $\{f_n\}$ of strongly measurable simple functions such that $\qquad\qquad f(x)=\displaystyle\lim_nf(x)$ and $\qquad\qquad|f_n(x)|\leq|f(x)|,\ \ \ \ n=1,2,...,$ hold at each $x$ in $X$ . $\quad$ Proof. We can certainly assume that $f(X)$ contains at least one non-zero element of $E$ . Let $C$ be a countable dense subset of $f(X)$ , let $C^\sim$ be the set of rational multiples of elements of $C$ , and let $\{y_n\}$ be an enumeration of $C^\sim$ . We can assume that $y_1=0$ . It is easy to check (do so) that (1) for each $y$ in $f(X)$ and each positive number $\epsilon$ there is a term $y_m$ of $\{y_n\}$ that satisfies $|y_m|\leq|y|$ and $|y_m-y|<\epsilon$ . For each $x$ in $X$ and each positive integer $n$ define a subset $A_n(x)$ of $E$ by $\qquad\qquad A_n(x)=\{y_j:j\leq n\ \ \ {\rm and}\ \ \ |y_j|\leq|f(x)|\}.$ Since $y_1=0$ , each $A_n(x)$ is non-empty. $\quad$ We now construct the required sequence $\{f_n\}$ by letting $f_n(x)$ be the element of $A_n(x)$ that lies closest to $f(x)$ (in case (2) $\quad\quad|f(x)-y_j|=\inf\{|f(x)-y_i|:y_i\in A_n(x)\}$ holds for several elements $y_j$ of $A_n(x)$ , let $f_n(x)$ be $y_{j_0}$ , where $j_0$ is the smallest value of $j$ for which $y_j$ belongs to $A_n(x)$ and satisfies (2)) It is clear that each $f_n$ is a simple function and that $|f_n(x)|\leq|f(x)|$ holds for each $n$ and $x$ . $\color{red}{\underline{\color{black}{\text{Since the sets $\{x\in X:f_n(x)=y_j\}$ can be described}}}}$ $\color{red}{\underline{\color{black}{\text{by means of inequalities involving $|f(x)|$, $|y_i|$, $i=1,...,n$,}}}}$ $\color{red}{\underline{\color{black}{\text{and $|f(x)-y_i|$, $i=1,...,n$, each $f_n$ is strongly measurable.}}}}$ Finally, observation (1) abov implies that $\{f_n\}$ converges pointwise to $f$ (if $y_m$ satisfies the inequalities $|y_m|\leq|f(x)|$ and $|y_m-f(x)|<\epsilon$ , then $|f_n(x)-f(x)|<\epsilon$ holds whenever $n\geq m$ ). $\blacksquare$ Thanks in advance.","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"

1145238,Are there numbers in R which cannot be expressed as a finite formula (including limits)?,"A fellow student just claimed that there are numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ which cannot be expressed as a limit. I don't think that is true, but first some definitions / examples: Definition : A set $S$ is countable if there exists an injective function $f:S \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Examples : $\{1,2,3,4\}, \mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ are all countable. $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable. Now we can define a formal Grammar $(V, \Sigma, P, S)$ with: The terminal symbols $\Sigma = \{0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,.,+,-,\cdot,:,(,), \lim, n, \mathrm{pow}, !, \sum, \prod\}$ The vocabulary: $V = \Sigma \cup \{S, Z, N, \mathrm{var}\}$ The production rules $P \subseteq (V^* \setminus \Sigma^*) \times V^*$ (they follow) The start symbols $S$ The set of production rules is $S \rightarrow Z\mid\lim_{\mathrm{var}\rightarrow \infty} S \mid  S+S\mid S-S\mid S \cdot S\mid S:S\mid (S)\mid S^S\mid S!\mid \sum_{\mathrm{var}=N}^\infty S\mid \prod_{\mathrm{var}=N}^\infty S$ $Z \rightarrow ZZ\mid N.N\mid -N.N$ $N \rightarrow NN\mid 0\mid 1\mid 2\mid 3\mid 4\mid 5\mid 6\mid 7\mid 8\mid 9$ $\mathrm{var}\rightarrow n_N$ You can build some invalid expressions with this grammar (like $\frac{0}{0}$), but I think you can express every number which can be written as a finite forumula / a limit of a finite formula limit with it (can you?). Sanity check $\mathbb{Q} \in \mathcal{L}(V, \Sigma, P, S)$ $e^x = \lim_{n_1 \rightarrow \infty} (1+\frac{x}{n_1})^{n_1}$ (where $x$ is any number) $\in \mathcal{L}(V, \Sigma, P, S)$ $\pi = \sum_{n_1 = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n_1}}{2\cdot n_1 + 1}\in \mathcal{L}(V, \Sigma, P, S)$ Question Now my problem is that this grammar suggests that you can enumerate each limit with it by using breadth first search. This means the language which is created by this grammar is countable. This either means (1) that I forgot some important numbers which cannot be expressed that way or (2) that there are numbers in $\mathbb{R}$ which cannot be expressed with a finite ""formula"" and my grammar cannot be extended so that it would work. Now I want to know if (1) or (2) is the case. If (1) is the case: What are characteristics of those numbers? What is their name? Obviously they cannot be in $\mathbb{Q}$ and there have to be at least countable infinite many of this kind as you can add numbers of $\mathbb{Q}$ to them, so if (1) is the case those numbers have to have some interesting properties If (2) is the case: Which group did I forget? Which numbers cannot be expressed this way?","['elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"

It's possible to place 4 unit spheres in a configuration like a tetrahedron to get $2^4 = 16$ regions, but beyond that, we can't place another unit sphere that intersects every single region.

1145400,"Is this proof for $(\mathbb{Z},+) \ncong (\mathbb{Q},+)$ valid?","In an introductory cryptography course, our teacher demonstrated a proof for $(\mathbb{Z},+) \ncong (\mathbb{Q},+)$. I'm not convinced, even though the statement may be correct (I don't know). Earlier in the course, we had seen the isomorphism of the Klein-4 group as $(\{0,1\}^2,+)$ and the 2D symmetry group of a rectangle not being a square (using identity, vertical reflection, horizontal reflection and 180 degree rotation). Now, our teacher made a list of different equations and whether or not they could be solved in the sets $\mathbb{Z}^+, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. This to show that some equations can be solved in certain sets but not in others (like $x=3$ being solvable in all four sets, but $3x=5$ only in the latter two and $x^2=-1$ in none of the considered sets). Then, she stated that if we have some equation using an operation $\odot$ that is solvable in $A$ but not in $B$, then $(A,\odot) \ncong (B,\odot)$ (supposing of course that $(A,\odot)$ and $(B,\odot)$ are groups). This already is a rather vague description, isn't it? She then proposed the equation $x+x=3$ which is solvable in $\mathbb{Q}$ but not in $\mathbb{Z}$. While that is obviously correct, I'm not sure if this argument is sound and if it actually proves the two groups not being isomorph. I have difficulties to express my concerns. Somehow, I would expect the constant $3$ in that equation to be some number from the particular set instead of some constant. I'm not convinced by the argument because if we'd map all odd numbers from $\mathbb{Q}$ to even numbers in $\mathbb{Z}$, the equation would in fact be solvable in $\mathbb{Z}$.

I know that since $d$ is a metric, $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$ by the triangle inequality. Is it enough to use the triangle inequality like this: \begin{align*}
d(x, y) &\leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) \\
\Rightarrow f(d(x, y)) & \leq f(d(x, z) + d(z, y)) \\
&\leq f(d(x, z)) + f(d(z, y))

1145701,Proof of the Bernstein–Chernov bound,"This is Exercise 5.2.1 from Achim Klenke: »Probability Theory — A Comprehensive Course«. Exercise (Bernstein–Chernov bound): Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $p_1,\ldots, p_n \in [0,1]$. Let $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ be independent random variables with $X_i = \mathrm{Ber}_{p_i}$ (this means Bernoulli-distributed: $\mathbf{P}[X_i = 1] = p_i, \mathbf{P}[X_i = 0] = 1-p_i$) for any $i = 1,\ldots, n$.  Define $S_n = X_1 +\cdots+X_n$ and $m:= \mathbf{E}[S_n]$. Show that, for any $\delta > 0$, the following two estimates hold:
  \begin{align*}
  \mathbf{P}[S_n\geq (1+\delta)m] &\leq \biggl(\frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{1+\delta}}\biggr)^m \\
  \mathbf{P}[S_n\leq (1-\delta)m] &\leq \exp\biggl(-\frac{\delta^2 m}{2}\biggr)\, .
\end{align*}
  Hint: For $S_n$, use Markov’s inequality with $f(x) = e^{\lambda x}$ for some $\lambda > 0$ and then find the $\lambda$ that optimizes the bound. Solution: We prove the first inequality. The Markov inequality says that for a real random variable $X$ and $f\colon [0,\infty) \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ monotone increasing, for any $\varepsilon > 0$ with $f(\varepsilon) > 0$ the following holds:
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{P}\bigl[|X| \geq \varepsilon\bigr] \leq \frac{\mathbf{E}\bigl[f(|X|)]}{f(\varepsilon)}\, .
  \end{equation*} Using the Markov inequality with $X = S_n$, $\varepsilon = (1+\delta) m$ and $f(x) = e^{\lambda x}$ (which is monotone increasing) we get:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{P}\bigl[S_n \geq (1+\delta)m\bigr] & \leq \frac{1}{e^{\lambda(1+\delta)m}} \mathbf{E}\bigl[e^{\lambda S_n}\bigr] \, .
\end{align*}
Using the definition of $S_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$ and the independence of the $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{E}\bigl[e^{\lambda S_n}\bigr] = \mathbf{E}\Bigl[\prod_{j=1}^n e^{\lambda X_j} \Bigr] 
   = \prod_{j=1}^n \mathbf{E}\bigl[e^{\lambda X_j}\bigr] =  \prod_{j=1}^n \bigl(e^{\lambda} p_j + (1-p_j)\bigr) \, .
\end{align*}
We now use $\lambda = \ln(1+\delta)$. All derivatives of $e^{\delta x}$ are positive for $\delta > 0$, so a Taylor expansion around $x=0$ gives us that $e^{\delta x} \geq 1 + \delta x$.
`\begin{align*}
  \mathbf{P}\bigl[S_n \geq (1+\delta)m\bigr] & \leq \frac{1}{e^{\ln(1 + \delta) (1+\delta)m}} \prod_{j=1}^n \Bigl(e^{\ln(1 + \delta)} p_j + (1-p_j)\Bigr) \\
  & = \frac{1}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)m}} \prod_{j=1}^n (\delta p_j + 1) \\
  & \leq \frac{1}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)m}}\prod_{j=1}^n e^{\delta p_j} \\
  & = \frac{e^{\sum_{j=1}^n \delta p_j}}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)m}} 
  = \frac{e^{\delta m}}{(1+\delta)^{(1+\delta)m}} = \biggl(\frac{e^\delta}{(1+\delta)^{1+\delta}}\biggr)^m \, .

1145725,Almost every $x$ is a cluster point of its own trajectory.,"The following problem appears in [1]: 2.3.2(a) Let $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space and let $T:X \rightarrow X$ be a continuous map. Suppose that $\mu$ is a $T$-invariant probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of $X$. Prove that for $\mu$-almost every $x \in X$ there is a sequence $n_k \rightarrow \infty$ with $T^{n_k}(x) \rightarrow x$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. (b) Prove that the same conclusion holds under the assumption that $X$ is a metric space, $T:X \rightarrow X$ is Borel measurable, and $\mu$ is a $T$-invariant probability measure. This question appears in the section on Poincaré recurrence. Intuitively, it makes sense and should obviously be true. However, I am having difficulty writing a nice proof, mainly from the fact that $x$ is a specific point in its own neighborhood, and I cannot be certain when changing neighborhoods that the collection of almost every point returning is the same. My intuition is telling me that I might be able to use the Lebesgue number of an open cover of $\varepsilon$-balls to simplify the argument. However, part (b) does not assume compactness (or even completeness). What I want to say is: Let $A_k = \{x \in X : \exists n_k \in \mathbb{N}, T^{n_k}(x) \in B_k(x)\}$, where $B_k(x) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) < 1/k\}$, for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$. By Poincaré recurrence, $\mu(A_k) = \mu(X) < \infty$. Let $B = \cap_{j=1}^\infty A_j$. Then, $B$ is precisely $\{x \in X : \exists n_k \rightarrow \infty, T^{n_k}(x) \rightarrow x \mathrm{\ as\ } k \rightarrow \infty\}$, and $\mu(B) = \mu(X)$.

Does this difference give us the idea that it is meaningful to ask whether or not $B \in A$? Is there where ZFC states that everything is a set? If yes, how? Excuse my ignorance but apologies in advance if these are unrelated questions. Second question: Paul Halmos arrives at $B \not \in A$ for $P(x):=x \not \in x$ and goes on to state that nothing is contained in everything, given that the universe of discourse $A$ was arbitrary. I fail to see the conclusion. P.S.

1146345,Notational position of $dx$ in integral,"In the Analysis courses in Aachen in the 1980s, an integral, whether Riemann or Lebesgue always had the form $$ \int \text{stuff}\, d\text{var} $$ where the $\int$ and the $d\text{var}$ where used like braces to enclose the integrand 'stuff'. These days on the net and in books, often in the context of physics, I find a notation like $$ \int d\text{var}\, \text{stuff}_1\, \text{stuff}_2 $$ where it seems that at least $\text{stuff}_1$, maybe even $\text{stuff}_2$, is the integrand. The situation is even more confusing if 'var' is not just a variable but a more elaborate expression. As an example consider the formula from Wikipedia : $$ f(H) = \int dE\, |\Psi_E\rangle \,f(E)\, \langle\Psi_E^{*}| $$ Where is $\text{var}$ and where is $\text{stuff}$ now?

On top of that, I'd like to fix one element in the cartesian power to a certain value (say the second), and count the number of possibilities with this fixed value. Simple example : with $X=\{A, B, C\}$ and $n=4$. The question is: how many four-letter words with an $A$ in the second position have a (relative) majority of $A$'s? And how many have a (relative) majority of $B$'s? Solution for the simple example : We can iterate on the total number $k$ of the element we want as a (relative) majority (say $A$). With $k=4$ elements being $A$, there is 1 option ($A$ is the majority, and $A$ is in the second position) $AAAA$ With $k=3$ elements being $A$, there are three possibilities for locating $A$'s. The second element is $A$ by constraint. The two extra $A$'s can be in position $(1,3), (1,4)$ or $(3,4)$. And there is one free position, where it can be everything but $A$: 2 possibilities. In total: $3\times 2=6$ possibilities. $AAAB, AAAC, AABA, AACA, BAAA, CAAA$ With $k=2$ elements being $A$'s, there is an extra-challenge: the two remaining positions should not be the same, otherwise $A$'s are not a majority anymore. About locating the $A$'s, one is fixed in the second position and the other $A$ can be in position $(1)$, $(3)$ or $(4)$: 3 possibilities. In the two remaining positions, there are 2 possibilities for the first one ($B$ or $C$ but not $A$) and 1 possibility for the second one (not $A$ and not the same than the first one). Total: 6 possibilities. $AABC, AACB, BAAC, CAAB, BACA, CABA$ With $k=1$ element being $A$, there are zero possibilities for $A$ to be a majority (three remaining possibilities, with only two letters, $B$ and $C$, so necessarily a majority of $B$ or $C$).

I asked this question on puzzling.se and someone suggested I post it here: I discovered this by accident, when trying to create a formula that generates prime numbers (an impossible task, I know). But, I find it very interesting that you take any prime number 5 and greater, then you square it and subtract 1, dividing it by 24 always results in a whole integer. For example: 5 x 5 = 25 - 1 = 24 / 24 = 1
7 x 7 = 49 - 1 = 48 / 24 = 2
11 x 11 = 121 - 1 = 120 / 24 = 50 The result is always a whole number, regardless of how high the prime number is. Can someone explain why this is so, mathematically? This does not seem possible (to me). And if this is really true, why can I find nothing written about it? I have never heard of this theorem before, and nothing is mentioned on Wikipedia or other sources. But perhaps this could be a helpful in reducing $33\%$ of the possibilities when trying to find or prove large prime numbers, computationally.

1146548,"Number of strings, when each character must occur even times","I was reading this question on programmers.StackExchange and wanted to try a combinatorics approach to solve the following problem: Let $S=\{A,B,C,D\}$ be a set of characters and $n$ a positive natural,
  find the number of strings of length $n$ composed of characters in $S$
  such that each character occur even times. I tried to solve it by myself but I am stuck and I would appreciate a hint to solve this kind of problems. Also, there are similar questions on this site for not quite exactly the same problem, but I didn't find an answer that could help me. Current attempt First, when $n$ is odd, the result must be zero. A string satisfying the desired property would necessarly have an even length, as a permutation of the concatenation of substrings of even lengths (each substring being a character from $S$ repeatead even times). Now, let's suppose that $n$ is even. If we have a mapping $c$ from $S$ to $\mathbb{N}$ assigning the number of occurence of each character (e.g. $c_A=0, c_B=2, c_C=4, c_D=0$), then the number of strings $N(c)$ we can produce with this mapping would be a k-permutation of characters, as we choose a string of size $n$ with $c_A$ times $A$, $c_B$ times $B$, etc. : $$N(c) = \frac{n!}{c_A! c_B! c_C! c_D!}$$ Also, I can evaluate the number of such mappings $c$: this is equivalent to finding the number of strings where characters appear in order with varying occurences. For example, with $n=4$: $$\begin{array}{c|cccc}
&            c_A & c_B & c_C &c_D \\
\hline
     AAAA &  4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     AABB &  2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\
     AACC &  2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
\dots\\
\end{array}
$$ The number of strings of size $n$ with an even number of each character is exactly the same as the number of strings of size $k=n/2$ with single characters (just imagine that AA, BB, CC, DD are characters).
So, the number of mappings is the number of combinations of characters from $S$, with repetition, like the following ones with $k=2$: AA AB AC AD
BB BC BD
CC CD
DD That is given as a $k$-combination of 4 elements: $$ N_{mapping}(k) = \binom{|S|+k-1}{k} = \binom {3+k}{k}$$ This is where I'am stuck. I wanted to combine this number of mappings with the number of permutations computed by each mapping, previously, but I can't ($N(c)$ depends on actual values of the mapping $c$).
Also, I am sure there is a more straightforward approach, but I don't know how to proceed. Thanks for any help you could provide.",['combinatorics']

Notice that for each $ n\in \mathbb{N} $, $ x_{n} $ can be written as $ \sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{x_{n,k}}{3^{k}} $ where $ x_{n,k}\in \{0,2\} $ for each $ k\in \mathbb{N} $. Since $ x\in [0,1] $ we have that $ x=\sum \limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{x_{k}}{3^{k}} $ where $ x_{k}\in \{0,1,2\} $ for each $ k\in \mathbb{N} $. Since $ \{x_{n}\} $ converges to $ x $, for each $ k\in \mathbb{N} $, there exists $ n_{k}\in \mathbb{N} $ such that for each $ n\geq n_{k} $, $ |x_{n}-x|<\frac{1}{3^{k}} $. This implies for each $ k\in \mathbb{N} $, there exists $ n_{k}\in \mathbb{N} $ such that for each $ n\geq n_{k} $, $ x_{k}=x_{n,k} $.

However, considering an alternative approach, we observe that $\frac{n}{n^2+n}<\frac{n}{n^2+i}<\frac{n}{n^2+1}$ . Therefore $$\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n^2+n}<\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n^2+i}<\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n^2+1} \implies \frac{n^2}{n^2+n}<\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n^2+i}<\frac{n^2}{n^2+1}$$ Taking limit $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}$ on the three expressions, we find that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^2}{n^2+n}=\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}\frac{n^2}{n^2+1}=1.$ Therefore by the sandwich theorem, $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{n^2+i}=1$ Since there exists a unique limit, there must be only one solution. Which approach is the correct one? There was one suggested reason that each of the individual limits that was calculated in the 1st approach had to be summed up to infinite terms. Since each of the limits were infintesimally small, we cannot predict the way they will behave when summed to infinity and therefore the approach is incorrect.

1146808,Prove $s$ is a supremum iff for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $a>s-\epsilon$.,"Let $A\subseteq\Bbb{R}$ is a nonempty set and $s\in \Bbb{R}$ is an upper bound. Prove $s$ is the supremum iff for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $a>s-\epsilon$.
This is important to me to know I am correct in my attempt, because I always grant more when I do try. Attempt: Suppose for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $a>s-\epsilon$. Assume $s$ is not the supremum. Then, since the supremum exists, let $s_1$ be the supremum. By the density of the real number,there exists $c$ such that $s_1<c<s$. Let us pick $\epsilon_1$ such that $s=c+\epsilon_1$ $\color{red}\Rightarrow c=s-\epsilon_1$ $\color{red}{\Rightarrow} s_1<s-\epsilon_1<s$ $\color{red}{\Rightarrow}$ $s>s_1+\epsilon_1$. Since for $\epsilon_1$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $a>s-\epsilon_1$. In particular $a>s_1+\epsilon_1-\epsilon_1$ meaning $a>s_1$. A contradiction. Therefore, $s$ is the supremum. Now, suppose, $s$ is the supremum. Assume there exists $\epsilon$ such that for all $a\in A$, $a<s-\epsilon$. That would mean that $s-\epsilon$ is an upper bound that is smaller than $s$. A contradiction. Therefore, for all $\epsilon>0$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $a>s-\epsilon$.","['calculus', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification']"

1146832,Inertia field of a compositum.,"My question is regarding composite field extensions. The problem is motivated but not explicitly stated in the chapter 4 exercises of Marcus' Number Fields, in particular ex. 31 c) We first provide the set-up: Let $K$ be an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ st $[K:\mathbb{Q}]=p^m$, where $p$ is prime $\in\mathbb{Z}$. Let $q\neq p\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $q$ is ramified in $K$. Fix $Q$ to be a prime of $\mathcal{O}_K$ lying over $q$, and let $e$ be the ramification index of $q$ in $Q$. Earlier exercises tell us that $e$ divides $q-1$, and hence, that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_q)$ has a unique subfield of degree $e$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. (To see this note that as $q$ is prime, |Gal$(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_q)/\mathbb{Q})$| = $q-1$, and as this is a cyclic group and $e$ divides $q-1$ we have a unique subfield, which can be determined by considering the multiplicative group of integers modulo $q$). We denote this subfield by $L$, and note that it is clearly a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We can now state the problem: Consider the compositum field $KL$, and let $U$ be a prime of $\mathcal{O}_{KL}$ lying over $Q$. My question is this, when we consider the inertia field of $KL$, where does it lie in the field extensions diagram? i.e. does it necessarily contain $K$? Does it necessarily contain $L$? Or is it a subfield of one or both of these fields? Let me be clear in saying that the inertia field I am referring to is specifically the subfield of $KL$ fixed by the inertia subgroup of $U$, that is 
$$\{\sigma \in G\:|\:\sigma(\alpha)\equiv\alpha\pmod{U}\: \forall \alpha\in\mathcal{O}_{KL}\},$$
where $G=\text{Gal}(KL/\mathbb{Q})$.","['number-theory', 'ramification', 'abstract-algebra', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'galois-theory']"

1146851,Why doesn't the author subtract everything by two first before applying modulus?,"This is from a youtube video on the Chinese Remainder Theorem  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru7mWZJlRQg What the author has done thus far is basically 1.Make sure that the mods, 3, 4, 5 are relatively pairwise prime by showing that gcd(3,4) = 1, gcd(3,5) = 1 and gcd(4,5) = 1. 2.Set up a table with mod 3, mod 4, mod 5 as the columns. He multiplied one column by the other two so that when applied it's modulus, say for mod 3, mod 4 and mod 5 column values will be set to zero. 3.Here's the part that I have a question about. The author states that the first linear congruence x $\equiv$ 2(mod 3) must be satisfied and to do so, he mods all the values by 3. The only non zero value will be the value in column 1(because of the last step). My question is by the definition of  a is congruent to b modulo m(below) Shouldn't the author have to subtract all the values by 2 first and then mod 3, that way he get 18 mod 3, 13 mod 3, and 9 mod 3, or 0, 1, and 0?

1146864,Moment method for weak convergence,"Say, we have a sequence of probability distributions $\mu_n$ on $\mathbb R$, that are uniformly subgaussian in the sense that $$\mu_n(\mathbb R\setminus[-R,R])\leq Ce^{-CR^2}$$ for some positive constant $C$. Assume that all moments of these distributions exist and that they converge to those of a standard normal distribution, i.e., $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int x^k~d\mu_n(x)=\begin{cases}(k-1)!!&\text{if }k\text{ is even}\\ 0 &\text{else}\end{cases}.$$ Then $\mu_n$ converges weakly to a standard-normal distribution $\mu$, i.e., $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \int f~d\mu_n=\int f~d\mu$$ for all bounded continuous $f$. The above claim is clearly true: The uniform subgaussian hypothesis implies that the $k$-th moments are uniformly bounded by $(Ck)^{k/2}$ and therefore the characteristic functions can be written as $$\int e^{itx}~d\mu_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(it)^k}{k!}\int x^k~d\mu_n(x),$$ which converges point wise to the characteristic function of the normal distribution. The result now follows from Levy's Continuity Theorem. Question: Is there a way to prove the above statement directly? (I am concerned with something related where the measures are random themselves and I can't argue with the characteristic function) Thoughts: Fix $\epsilon>0$ and $f\in C_b(\mathbb R)$ and choose $\lambda<\infty$ such that $\mu_n(\mathbb R\setminus[-\lambda,\lambda])\leq \epsilon$. From the Weierstraß approximation theorem, we find a polynomial $p$ that approximates $f$ on the interval $[-\lambda,\lambda]$ up to an error of $\epsilon$. Thus we find 
$$\big\lvert\int f~d\mu_n-\int f~d\mu\big\lvert\leq \int_{[-\lambda,\lambda]}\lvert f-p\lvert~d\mu_n+\big\lvert\int_{[-\lambda,\lambda]^c} f-p~d\mu_n\big\lvert+\big\lvert\int p~d(\mu_n-\mu)\big\lvert+\int \lvert p-f\lvert~d\mu.$$ The first term is bounded by $\epsilon$ and the third term converges to zero by assumption. The fourth term can be bound by $\epsilon$ and the integral outside the finite interval. Since $f$ is bounded we can estimate $\lvert f(x)-p(x)\lvert\leq c x^{2k}$ outside the interval for some $c,k\in\mathbb N$. It would therefore remain to show that $$\int_{[-\lambda,\lambda]^c} x^{2k}~d(\mu_n+\mu)$$ is small. Does this somehow follow from the subgaussian assumption (which wasn't really used till now)?","['calculus', 'weak-convergence', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability']"

1146893,"Prove that for a set of self-adjoint projectors on a Hilbert space, $\sum_k P_k$ is a projection iff $P_i P_j=0$","It is known that a projection operator can be written explicitly as follows: $$\hat{P} = \sum_{k=1}^n \hat{P_k} = \sum_{k=1}^n | k \rangle\langle k|$$ where $\{|k\rangle$, $k= 1,\ldots,n\}$ are the orthonormal basis. So it is curious to ask if a projection should always be written as the sum of projection operators to the smaller subspaces, which are orthogonal to each other. This is proved as following. Given two projection operators $\hat{P_1}$ and $\hat{P_2}$, for the sum $\hat{P} = \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2}$ to be also a projection operator: $$(\hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2})^2 = \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2} \\
 \Rightarrow \hat{P_1}^2 + \hat{P_2}^2 + \hat{P_1}\hat{P_2}
 + \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} \\
= \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2} + \hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} + \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2}$$ Therefore we get $$\hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} + \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1}\tag 1 = 0$$ (1) left-multiplied by $\hat{P_1}$, we get: $$\hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} + \hat{P_1}\hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = 0\tag 2$$ (1) right-multiplied by $\hat{P_1}$, we get: $$\hat{P_1}\hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = 0\tag3$$ (2) - (3) gives: $$\hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} - \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = 0\tag4$$ (1) + (4) eventually gives: $$\hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} = \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = 0\tag5$$ The above proved that equation (5) is the necessary condition for the sum $\hat{P} = \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2}$ to be also a projection operator. It is straightforward to see that (5) is the sufficient condition, too. So we conclude that: $$(\hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2})^2 = \hat{P_1} + \hat{P_2} \\
\Longleftrightarrow \hat{P_1}\hat{P_2} = \hat{P_2}\hat{P_1} = 0$$ given two projection operators $\hat{P_1}$ and $\hat{P_2}$.

1146901,Equivalence of definitions of tangent space,"For a given manifold $M$ and a point $x \in M$, we can define the tangent space at $x$, $T_xM$ in two ways (more, actually, but I am just concerned about these two for now): 1) Given a chart $(U, \phi)$, where $p \in U$, call two curves $\gamma_1 : (-1,1) \to M $, $ \gamma_2 : (-1,1) \to M $, ($ \gamma_1(0)=\gamma_2(0)=p$) $\textbf{equivalent}$ if $ (\phi \circ \gamma_1)'(0)=(\phi \circ \gamma_2)'(0)$. Call the equivalence classes $[\gamma]$ the $\textbf{tangent vectors of }$M$ \textbf{ at } x$. Define $T_xM$ as the collection of $[\gamma]$'s. These classes map to vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ via $[\gamma] \mapsto \frac{d}{dt}(\phi \circ \gamma)(0)$. 2) A $\textbf{derivation at } x$ is a linear map $D_x:C^\infty(M) \to \mathbb{R}$ such that, $\forall f,g \in C^\infty(M)$, $D_x(fg)=D_x(f)g(x)+D_x(g)f(x)$.

1146926,Can one player win more games while scoring fewer points over multiple trials a simple probabilistic game?,"The Game Two players $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ will play the following game: Three non-negative numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be selected at random from a distribution unknown to either player. The players know only that the numbers will be non-negative. Player $P_{1}$ will be given a choice of two options, after they make their selection the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ will be revealed, and $P_1$ and $P_2$ will score points depending on the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ as described below. ($P_2$ makes no choices.) Player $P_{1}$'s two options are: Option 1: Score points equal to $a+b$. Option 2: Score points equal to the maximum value of $a$, $b$, or $c$. Note: Neither player knows the values of $a$, $b$, or $c$ at the time this choice is made. Whichever option $P_{1}$ selects, $P_{2}$ will score the points of the other unselected option. For example, if: $P_1$ selects Option 2 $a$, $b$, and $c$ turn out to be $1$, $17$, and $\pi$ respectively Then: $P_1$ scores $17$ points (e.g. the maximum of $1$, $17$, and $\pi$) $P_2$ scores $18$ points (e.g. $a+b = 1+17 = 18$) The player who scores the most points wins the game. (Ties are also possible.) The Scenario Let's assume: The game will be played some number $N$ times, with the unknown distribution from which $a$, $b$, and $c$ are selected remaining fixed over these $N$ games. $P_1$ must select the same choice of Option 1 or 2 in each of the $N$ games. (e.g. they make only one choice at the beginning of Option 1 or 2, which is then applied in every game.) We tabulate both: The number of times each player wins The cumulative points scored by each player over the $N$ games The Question Does there exist: A distribution of numbers from which $a$, $b$, and $c$ are selected A choice by $P_1$, and Sufficiently large $N$ Such that both: $P_1$ is expected to win at least as many games as $P_2$, and $P_1$ is also expected to score no more points than $P_2$ ? (Thanks to Marcus M for answering this with a clear example!) Does the answer change if all values must be positive, as opposed to non-zero? My sense is that there is no such distribution possible when $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive - but I'm not sure how to go about proving that ? It's fairly easy to construct distributions such that Option 1 or Option 2 both lead to $P_1$ expecting to win more games and scoring more points , for example: If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are always some permutation of 0, 0, and 1 then as $N$ approaches infinity: Option 2 ties 2 games out of 3 and wins 1 game out of 3 Option 2 scores 1 point per game whereas Option 1 expects to score $2/3$ points per game If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are selected over a uniform continuous distribution then as $N$ approaches infinity: Option 1 expects to win 5 games out of 6, and score $4/3$rds as many points as Option 2. However I'm interested if it's possible to have distribution where there is a split outcome of winning more while also scoring less overall.

The set $S_p:=F^{-1}(1)\cap T_pM$ will be called the indicatrix of $F$ in $p$ and is a convex hypersurface of $T_pM$, diffeomorphic to an (n-1)-sphere. If we restrict the metric $g$ to $S_p$, so $(S_p,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold, whose distance I will call $d$. Then for any pair of nonzero vectors $v,w\in S_p$, we can define a certain ''angle'' doing
$$\sphericalangle_p(v,w)=d(v,w).$$ We say that a diffeomorphism $\phi:M\longrightarrow M$ is an isometry if $F(p,v)=F\big(\phi(p),d\phi_p(v)\big)$.
