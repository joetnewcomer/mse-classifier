480897,"Prove that the interval $[a,b]$ in $\Bbb R$ is the same as the segment $[a,b]$ in $\Bbb R^1$","Prove that the interval $[a,b]$ in $\Bbb R$ is the same as the segment $[a,b]$ in $\Bbb R^1$. 
That is, $\{x\in\Bbb R: a\le x\le b\} = \{y\in\Bbb R: \exists s,t\in [0,1], s+t=1\text{ and } y=sa+tb\}$ I was trying to solve it as follows. Let's denote 
$A= \{x\in\Bbb R: a\le x\le b\}$ and 
$B= \{y\in\Bbb R: \exists s,t\in [0,1], s+t=1\text{ and }y=sa+tb\}$. Then I wanted to show, that $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$ so $A = B$. For the $B\subseteq A$ I did the following: $y=sa+tb=sa+(1-s)b=s(a-b)+b$ that is obviously in $[a,b]$ (as when $s=0 $ then $y=b $ and when $s=1 $ then $ y=a$). So $B\subseteq A$. For $A\subseteq B$ I tried to show that if $x\in [a,b] $ then we can express $x=a+(b-a)k, k\in [0,1]$ then $x=a(1-k)+bk$ Saying that $(1-k)=t $ and $ k=s$ we can conclude that $A\subseteq B$. It seems to me that the second part is incorrect, but, unfortunately I can't figure out what should be done here.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"
480904,"Weaker Version of ""Goldbach's Other Conjecture""","Taken from problem 46 on Project Euler: It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number
can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square. $9 = 7 + 2 \times 1^2$ $15 = 7 + 2 \times 2^2$ $21 = 3 + 2 \times 3^2$ ... It turns out that the conjecture was false. Now, suppose the phrase ""twice a square"" was replaced with ""two squares.""  In other words, this revision of the conjecture would state that all odd composites $C$ can be written in the following form: $C=p+a^2+b^2$ Where $p$ is a prime and $a$ and $b$ can take on any non-negative integer values.  Making the substitution $a=b$ reduces this problem to the classical conjecture. Now, is this weaker conjecture true? My Attempt at the Problem: Let $d=a^2+b^2$ .  A well-known theorem states that the sum of two squares can be rewritten as $2^{e_0} \left( {p_1}^{e_1}...{p_n}^{e_n} \right) \left( {q_1}^{2 o_1}...{q_n}^{2 o_n} \right)$ , where $p_i$ is a prime of the form $4k+1$ and $q_i$ is a prime of the form $4k+3$ .  We can therefore write the conjecture as follows: $C=p+d$ $C=p+ 2^{e_0} \left( {p_1}^{e_1}...{p_n}^{e_n} \right) \left( {q_1}^{2 o_1}...{q_n}^{2 o_n} \right)$ $C=p+ 2^{e_0}g$ Where $g$ is any integer such that $g=1 \left( \text{mod } 4 \right)$ .  Letting $p=2$ and $e_0=0$ shows us that the conjecture is true when $C$ is of the form $4k+3$ . From here I am not sure where to go.  Any clues?","['number-theory', 'goldbachs-conjecture', 'conjectures', 'prime-numbers', 'sums-of-squares']"
480905,Conditions to satisfy trigonometric inequality,"I'm looking for sufficient (and necessary would be good too) conditions on $a,b,c$ such that \begin{align}
a\cos\phi + b \cos 3\phi + c \cos 5\phi \geq -1 \hspace{20pt} (\forall \phi)
\end{align} Given that $a+b+c=\frac 12$. In practise, $a,b,c$ are actually parametrisations of $\theta$: \begin{align}
a&=\frac 9 {16} + 2\theta \\
b&=-\frac 1 {16} - 3\theta \\
c&=\theta
\end{align} And I'm looking for the condition(s) on $\theta$. Deriving directly to find local minima reduces to solving a quintic (which I don't know how to do). Expressing $\cos n\phi$ as a polynomial in $\cos\phi$ seems numerically promising: Denoting $\alpha=\cos\phi$, this is equivalent to guaranteeing \begin{align}
(a+5c-3b)\alpha + (4b-20c) \alpha ^3 + (16c) \alpha ^5 \geq -1 \hspace{20pt} \forall \alpha\in[-1,1]
\end{align} Deriving here reduces to solving a quartic (which is one degree and a whole world of algebraic concepts easier). My plan was to just throw this into Matlab and graph the results. Alternatively, maybe it's feasible to find the general roots of the derivative which are real, and correspond to local minima, and ensure the condition. That sounds easier than it probably is in practise because of the dependence on $\theta$ which will probably generate more cases than it's practical to deal with. Lagrange multipliers would have helped but there's not really a constraint here. I was hoping for a closed-form, more analytical insight. A superposition identity that simplifies this, or some other trigonometric simplification. Thanks. EDIT Numerically, it appears that to double precision, the inequality holds for $-0.284203953109394 \leq \theta \leq  0.145635938534616$. Maybe some kind of monotonicity in $\theta$ can prove this is a unique interval. EDIT 2 The function (governing the inequality) is linear in $\theta$, which means we really only need to solve the 1-dimensional inequality for any fixed $\theta$ (say $\theta=0$), and extrapolate the extrema linearly. This indeed proves that there is a unique interval around $\theta=0$ on which the inequality will hold.","['optimization', 'trigonometry', 'inequality']"
480906,Prove $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{R}$,"Take $\mathbb{R}$ in the standard (order) topology.  Show that the closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{R}$. I'm new to topology, self-studying using the Munkres book.  In fact I'm new to proofs.  In the book he has just defined a closed set, and the notion of a closure of a set.  Here I attempt to do this proof.  I find it difficult not to appeal to things that seem 'obvious' in the course of a proof (I flag a couple of these points below).  But sometimes 'obvious' things are hard to prove indeed!  How can I improve my proof?  How would you prove it using only relatively elementary facts? Let us consider some irrational $x \in \mathbb{Q}'$.  For convenience, take $x>0$.  I intend to show that for any such $x$, there's no neighborhood of $x$ that does not intersect $\mathbb{Q}$, so all such $x$ have to be in the closure in question, $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ A minimal open set $U$ that contains $x$ is $(r_1, r_2)$ with $r_1<x<r_2$ and $r_1,r_2\in \mathbb{R}$.  But I shall show that no matter what we take for $r_1$ and $r_2$,
$$r_1<r_2 \iff \exists q \in \mathbb{Q}: r_1<q<r_2$$ To begin, note $r_1 < r_2 \iff 0<r_2-r_1$. Let us define $\Delta r \equiv r_2 - r_1$ Consider $(\Delta r)^{-1}$ -- it could be large if $\Delta r$ is small, but certainly$^1$ $\exists z \in \mathbb{Z}_+:z>(\Delta r)^{-1}$ and this implies that ${1 \over z}<\Delta r$.  By definition, ${1 \over z} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Next consider $m {1 \over z}$ for $m \in \mathbb{Z}$.  If we take $m=0$, then $m {1\over z}<r_1$ 
(Otherwise we get $r_1 < 0 < r_2,$ and $0 \in \mathbb{Q}$).
Also, if $m$ is large enough, then $m {1 \over z} > r_1$.  Let $M=\{0\} \cup \{m \in \mathbb{Z}_+:m {1 \over z}<r_1\}$.  Clearly $M$ is bounded by $zr_1$.  Take $n$ to be the largest element$^2$ of $M$.  Since $n \in M$, $n{1 \over z} < r_1$.  Also, $(n+1){1 \over z}>r_1$, since if not, $(n+1) \in M, (n+1)>n$ which contradicts that n is the largest element in $M$. Now 
$$n{1 \over z} < r_1 \wedge {1 \over z} < r_2 - r_1 \implies n{1\over z} + {1 \over z} < r_1 + (r_2 - r_1) \\
\implies (n+1){1 \over z} < r_2$$ Therefore, we have that 
$$ r_1 < {n+1 \over z} < r_2$$ But of course ${n + 1 \over z} \in \mathbb{Q}$ so this neighborhood of $x$ intersects $\mathbb{Q}$ no matter what interval $(r_1, r_2)$ containing $x$ we take, assuming $x$ is positive and irrational.  This means that all neighborhoods of positive irrational numbers intersect $\mathbb{Q}$.  I believe the argument for negative irrational numbers would go the same way without much different.  This would lead to all neighborhoods of positive and negative irrational numbers intersecting $\mathbb{Q}$, thus putting them in $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$.  But the set of all positive or negative irrationals plus all rationals is itself $\mathbb{R}$ so we have $\bar{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$. How did I do? $^1$ I didn't show that $\forall r \in \mathbb{R}: \exists q \in \mathbb{Z}_+:q>r$.  I find it difficult to prove something that seems so obvious.  But I would like to see it proved once.  How can we get that? $^2$ I didn't show that $M$ has a largest element, how might I do that?",['general-topology']

480936,Cardinality of the Fiber of a Finite Morphism Vs. Degree (via Vakil),"I would like to show the following (note: it is not an assigned problem, so it may be false) (EDIT: Indeed it is false, see end of post): Suppose $f:X \rightarrow Y$ is a finite, surjective morphism of integral nonsingular curves over $k$ algebraically closed. If the fiber over some point $p$ of $Y$ contains exactly one point of $X$, then $f$ is birational.
(Since a finite map is affine, we  can reduce to the case $X=SpecA$, $Y=SpecB$) In browsing around trying to prove this, I came upon Vakil's definition of the degree of a finite morphism at a point (Section 13.7 of his online notes). He defines the degree of $f$ at $p$ to be the dimension of $(f_*O_X)_p \otimes _{O_{Y,p}} k(p)$ as a $k(p)$ vector space, where $k(p)$ denotes the residue field of $Y$ at $p$. In an exercise, he asserts that degree is an upper semicontinuous function of the point on $Y$. My feeling is that this solves my problem. Degree as defined above is the dimension of the vector space of functions on the fiber over the field $k(p)$ (=$k$, since I assumed algebraically closed). Morally, this should be the number of points in the fiber, with a basis of functions being those which send one point in the fiber to 1 and the others to 0. Then, since degree counts the fiber, is upper semicontinuous, and equal to 1 at some point, then $f$ must be injective in a neighborhood, hence birational. My problem is that ""morally"" is not a proof and weird commutative algebra things can happen. So if my thought process is correct, can someone prove it to me? Also, if I am indeed on the right track, then in what kind of generality can one say that ""degree (as defined above) counts the fiber""? Thanks. EDIT: Li Yutong gives the example of projection of the curve $xy = z^2$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$. It is a 2:1 map except over the points (0:1) and (1:0) where it is 1:1. Since my proposition fails in such a nice case, my thinking about Vakil's ""degree"" must be way wrong.

480942,Properties of canonical divisor of fibres,"Suppose $f: X \to Y$ is a morphism between varieties, let $y \in Y$ be a closed point, and $X_y$ be the fibre of the morphism over $y$. I learned that the canonical divisor $K_X$ of $X$, the canonical divisor $K_{X_y}$ of $X_y$, and the relative canonical divisor $K_{X/Y}:= K_X -f^*K_Y$ are somehow related as the following: (1) For generic $y \in Y$, one has $ K_{X_y} \cong K_X|_{X_y}$. Remark Intuitively, I can understanding the relation given above, but I do not know how to show this rigorously. Besides, I do not know the correct conditions to be put on  $ f, X, Y$. Certainly one should assume $X,Y$ at least to be normal, but it seems that it is too strong to assume they are smooth . However, you can freely assume they are projective/proper varieties. (2) For generic $y$, $K_{X_y} \cong K_{X/Y}|_{X_y}$. Remark (i) $Y$ should to be at least $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein in order to make sense of pull-back of $K_Y$. (ii) If (1) is true, then (2) is equivalent to $(f^*K_Y)|_{X_y}=0$, this seems like some projection formula. (3) Both formula are not valid for all $y \in Y$, this can be seen from the example of $f$ being the blowup of one point in $\mathbb{P}^2$.",['algebraic-geometry']

Assume the statement is true if $\dim(V) = n-1$. If $\dim(V) = n$ then because $V$ is a complex vector space $N$ has an eigen vector: $Nw = \lambda w$. Two cases: Either $w \in U$ or $w \notin U$. 1) If $w \notin U$: Then $\tilde{V} = V \setminus span(w)$ is a space satisfying the induction hypothesis (for $\tilde{N} = N\mid_{\tilde{V}}$).

Then $AP_{(-\infty, \lambda)}$ is a bounded operator. What I have thought so far: $A$ can be thought of as the identity on its spectrum and since the spectrum is bounded from below, and since $P_{(-\infty, \lambda)}$ corresponds to the characteristic function of $(-\infty, \lambda)$, $AP_{(-\infty, \lambda)}$ corresponds to the identity on a bounded set, and is then a bounded operator. I have no idea on how to give a rigorous proof of this. Edit: Here $P_{\Omega} = \chi_{\Omega}(A)$ for a Borel set $\Omega$, and where $\chi$ is the characteristic function. $AP_{\Omega}$ is composition of the operators $A$ and $P_{\Omega}$. Edit: spectral theorem (multiplication form) : Let $A$ be a self-adjoint operator on a separable Hilbert space $H$. Then there is a finite measure space $(M, \mu)$, and a unitary operator $U: H \rightarrow L^2(M, \mu)$ and a real-valued function $f$ which is finite a. e. such that $UAU^{-1}\phi(m) = f(m)\phi(m)$. spectral theorem (projection valued measure form) There is a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators $A$ and projection-valued measures $\{P_{\Omega}\}$, the correspondence is given by

Definition of contractible : A space $X$ is said to be contractible if it has the homotopy-type of a point, i.e. there is a map $f : X \to \{p\}$ and a map $g : \{p\} \to X$ such that $fg \simeq \mathbb 1_p$ and $gf \simeq \mathbb 1_X$. Since $fg = \mathbb 1_p$, it suffices to show that there is some point in $X$ such that the identity map $\mathbb 1_X$ is homotopic to a constant map at some point $g(p) \in X$. Definition of deformation retract onto a point : there exists a map $f : X \times I \to X$ such that $f(x,0) = \mathbb 1_X$ and $f(x,1) = p$ for some fixed point $p \in X$ and $p$ does not depend on $x$.

I know that any vector in $\mathbb{R^3}$ can be represented by the span of these three vectors alone (it is quite intuitive, take some scalar times the first to get the first term of the vector, some scalar times the second, etc...). If we write out the augmented matrix for these three vectors and some vector $\vec{v}$ with elements $a, b, c$ we see the following: \begin{bmatrix}
1 &  0&0& a \\ 
0 &  1& 0& b\\ 
0 &  0& 1& c
\end{bmatrix} The first weight for the linear combinations is strictly set to be $a$, the second weight is $b$, and the third is $c$. Since, for any vector, these three vectors $i, j, k$ will always have solutions for the weights, namely a, b, and c. So, for any vector to be in the span of n vectors, we need a specific solution for each of the weights. (no free variables) In order to accomplish this, we would need the reduced row echelon form for any n vectors to be of the above ""triangular"" form, with $1's$ going down the diagonal. Is the above statement correct, or are there other cases in which this is true? Thanks!","['vector-spaces', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra']"

This is pretty basic stuff, but it somehow never occurred to me before. I'd like to make sure I'm using the term properly with respect to relations. The definition (and, I assume,  etymology) of bijective is usually given for functions as: (1) injective and surjective . But I've also heard the term used for relations. Thinking back, it would refer to a relation that is: (2) injective and uniquely defined . The point being that the bijective property should actually refer to the ""one-to-one"" nature of the relation or function in question. (Functions get uniquely defined 'for free'. The extra ingredient for a bijective function is surjectivity, probably with the purpose that its inverse is then also a bijective function.) But the two definitions are incompatible with the interpretation of functions as well-defined relations. Taking them both literally would result in contradiction: a non-surjective function would be bijective by (2) , but not bijective by (1) . How is this usually dealt with? Is there a generally accepted alternative term for (2) ? Edit 1: As it turns out I am unable to find any reference to definition (2) . I suppose my new question now becomes: Is there a nice term for uniquely defined, injective relations / injective partial functions? Edit 2: Take a look at this Wikipedia section: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation#Analogy_with_functions According to this, a relation can be bijective without being a function. It still doesn't correspond to (2) though. It keeps its etymological meaning: injective and surjective, i.e., the inverse of a function. The nouns bijection , injection and surjection are reserved for functions, but the adjectives can apply to relations too.

We assume that each outcome is equally likely(ie classical probability formulation). Let event A1 = ""card1 is the ace"", thus P(A1) = 1/3. Let event B = ""turn over card3 and it is not an ace"". My professor says that once B occurs it becomes the sample space since it becomes the full set of possibilities given that it actually occurred. He says that A1 = {1} and B = {1,2}, so now the probability of the ace being the first card is $P(A1|B) = \frac{|A1\cap B|}{|B|} = \frac{1}{2}$. The answer to this problem made me uneasy because this problem looks very similar to the Monty Hall problem. Applying the ""Monty Hall problem"" reasoning to this problem would give the probability of the ace being card 1 as 1/3, since the probability of the ace being card 2 (ie ""switching your pick"") would be 2/3.

Prove that $f$ is one-to-one if and only if $f \circ h = f \circ k$ implies $h = k$, for every set $C$ and all choices of functions $h: C \to A$ and $k: C \to A$. Here is my work: Assume that $f$ is one-to-one and let $A = \{x_1, x_2\}$ for two arbitrary $x_1, x_2$.
So we have $f(x_1) = f(x_1)$ and $x_1 = x_2$. Assume $h$ and $k$ are one-to-one. (Is that okay assume that they are one-to-one?) And let $C = \{z_1, z_2\}$ so we have $h(z_1)=h(z_2) = x_1$ and $k(z_1) = k(z_2) = x_2$ since $h: C \to A$ and $k: C \to A$. 
If we substitute $h(z)$ and $k(z)$ into $x_1$ and $x_2$ respectively, we have $f(h(z)) = f(k(z))$.
It follows $f \circ h = f \circ k$ implies $h = k$. Conversely, we assume that $f \circ h = f \circ k$. It follows $f(h(z_1))=f(k(z_2))$ follows $z_1 = z_2$.
Hence we can conclude that $h$ and $k$ are one-to-one.
Since we know $h: C \to A$ and $k: C \to A$, ($x_1$ and $x_2$ are elements of $A$) and $h(z_1) = x_1$ and $h(z_2) = x_2$. Since $h(z_1)=k(z_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$ and since these two elements are in $A$, $f$ is onto. I know it is hard to read, but I really need your help to check my ambiguous proof.

481845,Regression with a Vandermonde matrix.,"From what I understand, when doing a least squares regression with a Vandermonde matrix, you're essentially solving the equation $y=Xa$ Where $y$ is a vector of $y$ -values, $X$ is the Vandermonde matrix, and $a$ is a vector of coefficients. When you solve this equation for $a$ , $a=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ You get the above expression for $a$ . My understanding is that this should be a solution to the set of equations. However, it is possible to fit $n$ points of data to a $k$ -th degree polynomial, where $n>k$ . This would imply that there are more equations than unknowns, which results in no possible solutions. However, the vector a can be calculated. This resulting vector does not completely perfectly satisfy $y=Xa$ But instead is a good approximation, as with regression. Why can we get a value for $a$ ? As I do not believe this could be possible if we were dealing with $n$ equations, and $k$ unknowns. Where does the matrix solution differ from solving $k$ unknowns with $n$ equations?","['matrices', 'regression', 'least-squares']"

As $C_G(N)\subset N$, we have $G/N\leq G/C_G(N)$ I some how want to say that $G/C_G(N)$ is abelian and by that conclude that $G/N$ is abelian.

481880,let $H\subset G$ with $|G:H|=n$ then $\exists~K\leq H$ with $K\unlhd G$ such that $|G:K|\leq n!$ (Dummit Fooote 4.2.8),"Question is to prove that For $H\subset G$ with $|G:H|=n$, $\exists~K\leq H$ with $K\unlhd G$ such that $|G:K|\leq n!$ What i have done so far is that : $H$ be a subgroup of index $n$ in $G$ and let $\{g_i :1\leq i\leq n\}$ be its coset representatives.\
Consider the action of  $G$ on set of left cosets $G\times \{g_i H:1\leq i \leq n\}\rightarrow  \{g_i H:1\leq i \leq n\}$. In  other words we have the action  $G\times \{1,2,3,...n\}\rightarrow \{1,2,3,...n\}$. For each $g\in G$ acting on $\{1,2,3,...n\}$ we have image in $\{1,2,3,...n\}$. So,each $g\in G$ gives a permutation in $\{1,2,3,...n\}$ So, we have $G\rightarrow S_n$ a homomorphism. As $\eta : G\rightarrow S_n$ is a homomorphism, $Ker(\eta)$ would be a normal subgroup of $G$ and by Isomorphism theorem we have $G/Ker(\eta)$ is isomorphis to subgroup of $S_n$. Set $K=Ker(\eta)$, we see that $K\leq H$ and $G/K\cong M$ where $M\leq S_n$. As $|S_n|=n!$ we see that $|G/K|\leq n!$ and so, $|G:K|\leq n!$. Infact $|G:K|$ divides $n!$ which is not asked to prove in the Question. So, I am wondering whether my approach is fine or i have just proved something more.

481957,"$Q_8$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_8$, but not isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ for $n\leq 7$.","Question is to prove that : $Q_8$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_8$ , but not isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ for $n\leq 7$ . I see that $Q_8$ is isomorphic to subgroup of $S_8$ by left multiplication action. Hint given was to prove that stabilizer of any point contains $\{\pm 1\}$ . To prove Cayley's theorem, stating any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of $S_n$ we take action of given group on a set $A$ having same cardinality. with that motivation I want to check if there is a Isomorphism then there is a map from $G\times A \rightarrow A$ . i.e., $G$ gives a permutation group $S_A$ . I tried in same manner. Suppose $Q_8$ is isomorphic to subgroup of $S_n$ with $n\leq 7.$ Then it should come from a group action of $Q_8$ on a set of cardinality at most 7. Suppose $Q_8$ acts on a set $A$ with possible cardinality at most 7. For $a \in A,$ let $\textrm{Stab}(a)=\{g\in Q_8 : g \cdot a = a\}$ $\textrm{cl}(a)=\{g \cdot a : g\in Q_8\}$ denote the stabilizer of $a$ in $Q_8$ and the class (or orbit) of $a,$ respectively. I know the number of elements in a class of $a$ equals to the index of the stabilizer of $a$ in $Q_8.$ By the definition of class of $a$ , $\textrm{cl}(a)\subseteq A$ and as $|A|\leq 7,$ I see that $|\textrm{cl}(a)|\leq 7$ . But, $|\textrm{cl}(a)|=|Q_8: \textrm{Stab}(a)|$ for any element $a\in A$ . So, $|Q_8:\textrm{Stab}(a)|=|\textrm{cl}(a)|\leq 7$ for all $a\in A$ . So, $\textrm{Stab}(a)$ should be non-trivial subgroup of $Q_8$ (if not then $|Q_8:\textrm{Stab}(a)|=8.$ A proper non-trivial subgroup of $Q_8$ contains $\{\pm1\}$ . So, in the worst case, $\{\pm 1\}\subseteq \textrm{Stab}(a)$ for all $a\in A$ . As $\ker(\eta)=\cap_{a\in A}\textrm{Stab}(a)$ (where $\eta$ is the action of $Q_8$ on $A$ ) We see that $\{\pm 1\}\subseteq \ker(\eta)$ which means that $\ker(\eta)$ is non-trivial. Thus, there is no isomorphism (coming from $\eta$ ) between $Q_8$ and any subgroup of $S_7$ . I would be thankful if someone can check whether my approach is correct or if there is any other simple possible way. P.S : Usually what i do to see whether two groups are isomorphic or not is to check for cardinality, abelian property, no of elements with same order and so on. But I was having no idea when i fail in all these ways.
