1635495,"Is $\nu(E) = \max\{\mu(E),\eta(E)\}$ a measure","Let $\mu$ and $\eta$ be measures on the measurable space $(X,\mathcal{M})$. For $E \in \mathcal{M}$, define $\nu(E) = \max\{\mu(E),\eta(E)\}$. Is $\nu$ a measure on $(X, \mathcal{M})$? My Try: I use the fact: $$\max(a,b)=\frac{a+b+|a-b|}{2}$$
then I tried to prove that $\nu$ is a measure and though I can prove or get to a contradiction. $$\nu(E)=\max\{ \mu(E), \eta(E) \} = \frac{\mu(E) + \eta(E) +|\mu(E)- \eta(E)|}{2}$$ $\nu(\emptyset)=\frac{\mu(\emptyset)+\eta(\emptyset)+|\mu(\emptyset) -\eta(\emptyset)|}{2}=0$ since $\mu$ and $\eta$ are measure. Consider now a countable disjoint collection $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ of measurable sets \begin{align*}
\nu(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) &= \frac{1}{2} \Big[\mu(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k) +\eta(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k)+\Big|\mu(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k)-\eta(\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} E_k)\Big|\Big]\\
&=\frac{1}{2} \Big[\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_k)+ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \eta(E_k)+\Big|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_k)-\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \eta(E_k)\Big| \Big ]\\
&=\frac{1}{2} \Big[ \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \Big(\mu(E_k) +\eta(E_k)\Big) + \Big|\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} \mu(E_k) - \eta(E_k)\Big|\Big]

1635585,Uppercase E notation for sets?,"In JÃ³nsson and Tarski's (1951) paper Boolean Algebras with Operators, Part I from the American Journal of Mathematics, they write formulae such as $L_i = \underset{u}{\mathbf{E}} \, [u \in At^m \text{ and } u \leq x^{(i)}]$ and $K = \underset{u}{\mathbf{E}} \, [y \geq u \in At^m]$, without explaining this $\underset{u}{\mathbf{E}}$ notation. From the context, I guess these define sets, i.e., they respectively mean $L_i = \{u \mid u \in At^m \text{ and } u \leq x^{(i)} \}$ and $K = \{u \mid y \geq u \in At^m \}$. Am I correct in this? Also, is this notation something common that mathematicians generally understand? What does E stand for, and where did this notation originate? Are there good books/articles/webpages where I can learn about this notation? I would greatly appreciate your help! Additional note. To give some context, on p. 900, following the first formula, they proceed to define $K = \bigcup_{i \in I} L_i$ (which has nothing to do with the $K$ in the second of the formulae above) and say that $u \in K$ if and only if $\sum_{i \in I} x^{(i)} \geq u \in At^m$. In order for this equivalence to hold, it seems to me that $L_i = \{u \mid u \in At^m \text{ and } u \leq x^{(i)} \}$. $At$ denotes the set consisting of $0$ and all the atoms of a Boolean algebra $A$. For my interpretation to make sense, however, I suppose that $At^m$ should be the set consisting of $0$ and all the atoms of $A^m$, and not the $m$-times product of $At$.","['boolean-algebra', 'notation', 'elementary-set-theory', 'universal-algebra']"

$$\int_0^1 \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{ax-x^2\sin(\theta)}{\sqrt{a^2-2ax\sin(\theta)+x^2}}d\theta dx$$
This integral is from the following paper : Frictional coupling between sliding and spinning motion and can be understood as an integration of unit vector field parallel to the velocity of a spinning disk which is sliding with the speed of $a$ over a unit disk. The evaluation of the integral is claimed to be $$\frac{4}{3}\frac{(a^2+1)E(a)+(a^2-1)K(a)}{a}$$
for $a<1$, and $$\frac{4}{3}((a^2+1)E(1/a)+(a^2-1)K(1/a))$$
for $a\geq1$ in the paper, where $K$ and $E$ are the first and second kind of complete elliptic integrals respectively. But for me this integration is not clear since if I do the integration for $x$ first then it results in a term with natural log which is irrelevant to elliptic integral, and doing it for $\theta$ first results in the terms including $E(\frac{4ax}{(a-x)^2})$ and $K(\frac{4ax}{(a-x)^2})$ which seems hard to be reduced to $E(a)$ and $K(a)$.

1635823,Find a Markov chain transition kernel,"Let $f_{X}$ be a density we would like to sample from. For some reasons, $f_{X}$ may be analytically intractable or expensive to evaluate. A solution consists in considering a density $(x,y) \in X \times Y \, \mapsto \, f(x,y)$ on $X \times Y$ such that $f_{X}$ is a marginal density of $f$. Then, we define a Markov chain $(X_{n})_{n \geq 0}$ as follows : Given the current state of the chain $X_{n} = x$ : $ Y_n \sim f_{Y \mid X}(\cdot \mid x)$ $X_{n+1} \sim f_{X \mid Y}(\cdot \mid Y_n)$ where $f_{X \mid Y}(\cdot \mid y)$ (resp. $f_{Y \mid X}(\cdot \mid x)$) denotes the conditional density of $X$ given $Y=y$ (resp. of $Y$ given $X=x$). I would like to determine the transition kernel of the Markov chain $(X_{n})_{n \geq 0}$. For that, let $\varphi$ be a bounded measurable function on $X$. I would like to compute $\mathbb{E}\big[ \varphi(X_{n+1}) \mid \mathcal{F}_{n} \big]$ where $\mathcal{F}_{n} = \sigma(X_{0},\ldots,X_{n})$ is the natural filtration. Let $g(Y_n) = \mathbb{E}\big[ \varphi(X_{n+1}) \mid Y_n \big]$. Then : $$ g(y) = \int_{X} \varphi(u) f_{X \mid Y}(u \mid y) \, du. $$ Therefore : $$ \mathbb{E}\big[ \varphi(X_{n+1}) \mid \mathcal{F}_{n} \big] = \mathbb{E}\big[ g(Y_n) \mid \mathcal{F}_{n} \big] = \int_{Y} \Bigg( \int_{X} \varphi(u) f_{X \mid Y}(u \mid y) \, du \Bigg) f_{Y \mid X}(y \mid X_{n}) \, dy.$$ This can be rewritten : $$ \int_{X} \varphi(u) \Bigg( \int_{Y} f_{X \mid Y}(u \mid y) f_{Y \mid X}(y \mid X_{n}) \, dy \Bigg) \, du \tag{$\star$}$$ We know that $\mathbb{E}\big[ \varphi(X_{n+1}) \mid \mathcal{F}_{n} \big] = P\varphi(X_{n})$ where the transition kernel $P$ satisfies $\displaystyle P\varphi(x) = \int_{X} \varphi(u)P(x,du)$.

1636152,Double Integration over finite plane.,$$\phi(z)=\frac{\sigma}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int_{\frac{-a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}\int_{\frac{-a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}~dx~dy$$ I'm not sure how to do this integral. For the first integral w.r.t $x$ i tried to substitute $x=\sqrt{y^2+z^2}\sin{\theta}\implies dx=\sqrt{y^2+z^2}\cos\theta~d\theta$. The integral then becomes: $$\phi(z)=\frac{\sigma}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\int_{\frac{-a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}\int_{-\text{?}}^\text{?}1~d\theta~dy$$ But the bounds are $\text{?}=\arcsin{\frac{a}{2\sqrt{y^2+z^2}}}$ since arcsin is an odd function. However this just makes it even harder to solve. So what is the best way to do this integral? If it helps I will give the context of the question.

1636169,"Question on a ""dual form"" of $F$ that caprures the singularity of a plane section of $F$","In an article I was reading the notion of dual form came up, which I write down below. I was interested in learning more about this and I have two questions regarding it. This is how it came up:
Let $F(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ be a non-singular homogeneous rational polynomial. Then there exists a non-zero ""dual form""
$
f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in \mathbb{Q}[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]
$
such that 
we have
$$
f(\mathbf{t}) = 0
$$
whenever the plane section 
$$
F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathbf{x} = 0
$$
is a singular curve. 
Furthermore, $f$ is irreducible. My two questions are the following: Does this only hold for a form in $4$ variables? or is there a generalization for which works in more variables? (so that $f(\mathbf{t})$
vanishes whenever $F(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathbf{x} = 0$ is singular) I would like to learn some ideas behind the proof. I would greatly appreciate if someone could explain me how one can obtain such a form.","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

I am doing mainly complex analysis and recently I was informed about the existence of Artin's theorem and it sounded like it could be of interest to me. I have found a survey on the subject and I started reading it. Here's the link . So to the actual theorem (section 1.1) Let $\mathbb{k}$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $f(x,y)$ be a vector of convergent power series in two variables $x$ and $y$. Assume given a formal power series $\hat{y}(x)$ vanishing at 0,
  $$f(x,\hat{y}(x))=0.$$
  Then for any $c\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a convergent power series solution $\tilde{y}(x)$
  $$f(x,\tilde{y}(x))=0$$
  which coincides with $\hat{y}(x)$ up to degree $c$,
  $$\hat{y}(x)\equiv \tilde{y}(x) \mbox{ mod }x^c. $$ I really care only for the case where $k=\mathbb{C}$. Using the implicit function theorem for some analytic $f$ we get the existence of an analytic solution as long as the Jacobian is invertible at 0. If on the other hand the Jacobian is not invertible then we generically get some king of branching and this means that there is no formal solution in powers of $x$ that solves the equation. So in that sense I don't see how Artin's theorem is stronger than the implicit function theorem in the analytic setting. Is this true or do I miss something? By the way I don't know what happens when we considering other fields and I don't imply that the theorem is trivial or useless.","['complex-analysis', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Everywhere I looked had the same approach, where they first looked at curvature by finding the rate of change of the angle between the tangent at the point of interest and the $x$ -axis, with respect to arc length, and then getting to the radius of curvature. What I've done seems more of a direct approach to me, maybe more geometric as well. What I started with: What I finished with: $$R = \left | \frac{(1+f'(a)^2))^{\frac{3}{2}}}{f''(a)} \right |$$ Before getting to that I made these statements: $$\left (  \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}f(a+h)=f(a)\right )$$ and \begin{align*}
\text{By definition:}\qquad
\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} &= f'(a), \\

1637409,What does the integral of position with respect to time mean?,"The integral of acceleration with respect to time is velocity.
The integral of velocity with respect to time is position. What is the integral of position with respect to time, and what does it mean? Please explain so that your answer is understandable by someone who took calculus I.","['intuition', 'physics', 'integration', 'calculus']"
1637412,Would this solution of the limit of the sequence be correct?,"Let's suppose that I have the sequence $a_n = \frac{1}{n^2} + \frac{2}{n^2} + \frac{3}{n^2} + \ldots + \frac{n}{n^2}, n \in \mathbb{N}$. And I have to find the limit of the sequence as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Would the below solution be correct? The sequence $a_n$ can be rewritten as
\begin{align}
a_n &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{k}{n^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
&= \frac{n+1}{2n}.
\end{align} Thus we have
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}.
\end{align}","['sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification', 'limits']"
