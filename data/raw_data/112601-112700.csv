1633326,What's so special about hyperbolic curves?,"This is really a two-part question, but I would be happy to get an answer for either bit. By a hyperbolic curve as defined by e.g. Szamuely in Galois Groups and Fundamental Groups (p.137) I mean an open subcurve $U$ of an integral proper normal curve $X$ over a field $K$ such that $2g-2+n>0$ where $g$ is the genus of the base change $X_\bar{K}$ $n$ is the number of closed points in $X_\bar{K}\backslash U_\bar{K}$. Many theorems/conjectures in anabelian geometry involve hyperbolic curves - for example, the section conjecture states that the rational points $U(K)$ on a hyperbolic curve $U$ correspond bijectively to (conjugacy classes of) sections of $\rho$ in the exact sequence of Ã©tale fundamental groups $1\rightarrow \pi_1 (U_\bar{K}) \rightarrow \pi_1 (U)\xrightarrow{\rho}G_K \rightarrow 1$ where $G_K$ is the absolute Galois group of $K$. Now, amongst all hyperbolic curves I have seen many particular references to the curve $U = \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{Q}}^1 \backslash \left\{0,1,\infty\right\}$. Indeed, in his Notes on Etale Cohomology (p.30), J.S. Milne says that $\pi_1 (U)$ is arguably the most interesting object in mathematics. I know that in part this is because it ought to give us insight into the absolute Galois group of the rationals, but the particular choice of removed points seems quite mysterious to me. So my questions are: Where does the interest in hyperbolic curves come from? Why is $= \mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{Q}}^1 \backslash \left\{0,1,\infty\right\}$ of particular interest?","['number-theory', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1633354,Why can quotient groups only be defined for subgroups?,"I know that for the operation on cosets to be well-defined one requires normality. But why is it a requirement (with $G / N$) that $N$ be a subgroup or even a subset of $G$? Surely all that is required is that $N$ is a normal subgroup of a group $S$ (say), of which $G$ is a subgroup of. In which case $G / N \le S/N$.",['group-theory']

1633453,Why do people all the time exploiting almost sure properties of a stochastic process as if they were sure properties?,"All the time, I see people working with a given Brownian motion $(B_t)_{t\ge 0}$ on a fixed probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ and suddenly exploiting its almost sure properties as if they were sure properties. Yeah, I know we can find a $\operatorname P$-null set $N\subseteq\Omega$ such that these properties hold surely on $\tilde\Omega:=\Omega\setminus N$ and hence coud replace $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ by $(\tilde\Omega,\left.\mathcal A\right|_{\tilde\Omega},\left.\operatorname P\right|_{\tilde\Omega})$. As a second option, we can modify $X_t$ on $N$ for any $t\ge 0$ such that these properties hold surely on $\Omega$. However, either we need to modify the probability space or the Brownian motion. But that's a weird and unusual practice in mathematics. If we can't prove the desired result, then we just modify our objects such that we can prove them. Carry the world as you like it . Shouldn't we better state (in a theorem) that there exists $B$ and $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ such that ... instead of fixing $B$ and $(\Omega,\mathcal A,\operatorname P)$ (at a global space)? And that's just an example. In probability theory, we do things like that all the time. Why is it legitimate?","['stochastic-processes', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

One can use the implicit differentiation $y'(x) = -\frac{\partial_y f}{\partial_x f}$ to obtain $$s = \int\sqrt{1 + |\partial_y f / \partial_x f|^2}\,dx,$$ but that still requires (locally) solving for $y(x)$. Is there any formulation that does not require this, e.g. another implicit equation involving $s$? Thoughts so far: One could rewrite $s$ as $$s = \int |\nabla f|\, |\partial_x f|dx,$$ or symmetrize to $$s = \int |\nabla f|\, \underbrace{(|\partial_x f|dx + |\partial_y f|dy)}_{(*)}/2$$ where $(*)$ might be strongly related to $|df|$ I guess (though it's not identical due to the $|\cdot|$), but then?","['real-analysis', 'integration', 'implicit-function-theorem', 'implicit-differentiation']"

1633704,Calculating the length of the paper on a toilet paper roll,"Fun with Math time. My mom gave me a roll of toilet paper to put it in the bathroom, and looking at it I immediately wondered about this: is it possible, through very simple math, to calculate (with small error) the total paper length of a toilet roll? Writing down some math, I came to this study, which I share with you because there are some questions I have in mind, and because as someone rightly said: for every problem there always are at least 3 solutions. I started by outlining the problem in a geometrical way, namely looking only at the essential: the roll from above, identifying the salient parameters: Parameters $r = $ radius of internal circle, namely the paper tube circle; $R = $ radius of the whole paper roll; $b = R - r = $ ""partial"" radius, namely the difference of two radii as stated. First Point I treated the whole problem in the discrete way. [See the end of this question for more details about what does it mean] Calculation In a discrete way, the problem asks for the total length of the rolled paper, so the easiest way is to treat the problem by thinking about the length as the sum of the whole circumferences starting by radius $r$ and ending with radius $R$.
But how many circumferences are there? Here is one of the main points, and then I thought about introducing a new essential parameter, namely the thickness of a single sheet. Notice that it's important to have to do with measurable quantities. Calling $h$ the thickness of a single sheet, and knowing $b$ we can give an estimate of how many sheets $N$ are rolled: $$N = \frac{R - r}{h} = \frac{b}{h}$$ Having to compute a sum, the total length $L$ is then: $$L = 2\pi r + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi R$$ or better: $$L = 2\pi (r + 0h) + 2\pi (r + h) + 2\pi (r + 2h) + \cdots + 2\pi (r + Nh)$$ In which obviously $2\pi (r + 0h) = 2\pi r$ and $2\pi(r + Nh) = 2\pi R$.
Writing it as a sum (and calculating it) we get: $$
\begin{align}
L = \sum_{k = 0}^N\ 2\pi(r + kh) & = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1}\ 2\pi(r + kh)
\\\\
& = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} r + 2\pi h \sum_{k = 1}^{N-1} k
\\\\
& = 2\pi r + 2\pi R + 2\pi r(N-1) + 2\pi h\left(\frac{1}{2}N(N-1)\right)
\\\\
& = 2\pi r N + 2\pi R + \pi hN^2 - \pi h N
\end{align}
$$ Using now: $N = \frac{b}{h}$; $R = b - a$ and $a = R - b$ (because $R$ is easily measurable), we arrive after little algebra to $$\boxed{L = 4\pi b + 2\pi R\left(\frac{b}{h} - 1\right) - \pi b\left(1 + \frac{b}{h}\right)}$$ Small Example: $h = 0.1$ mm; $R = 75$ mm; $b = 50$ mm thence $L = 157$ meters which might fit. Final Questions: 1) Could it be a good approximation? 2) What about the $\gamma$ factor? Namely the paper compression factor? 3) Could exist a similar calculation via integration over a spiral path? Because actually it's what it is: a spiral.

1633895,affine variety definition,"I had this very elementary question which baffles me. Most introductions to the topic define an affine variety as a subset of affine space that is the zero-locus of a set of polynomials. Now, $X:=\mathbb{A}\setminus\{0\}$ does not satisfy this property. Yet I see in many places that it is treated as an affine variety (e.g. on Wikipedia) because it is isomorphic (not biregular, but birational, I guess) to the zero-locus of one variety that does satisfy the above definition (the zero-locus of $\langle xy-1\rangle$ on $\mathbb{A}^2$). Now, there's a circularity problem here, since for two objects to be isomorphic they must first be in the same category, and, according to our original definition, the first object $X$ is not an object in the category of affine varieties (over the given field, say $\mathbb{C}$). I assume there's some reference with a definition that captures this silly issue and gives a broader definition that pleases me, but I can't find it. The question then is: what should such a definition of an affine variety (in a classical sense, that is, avoiding schemes and the like) be?

1634106,Cech cohomology commuting with colimits? (Non noetherian confusion.),"Suppose that $X$ is a quasicompact, separated $A$-scheme, and $I$ is some directed poset. Suppose that $F_i$ is a system of sheaves on $X$ over $I$. I am having difficulties proving the claim that $H^i(X, \operatorname{colim} F_j) = \operatorname{colim} H^i(X, F_j)$. (An exercise in Ravi chapter 18.) Does one need $X$ to be locally Noetherian? Mainly, the confusion is that because $X$ if is not locally Noetherian, there are conceivably affine opens in some chosen cover were the $\operatorname{colim} (F_i(U)) \not = (\operatorname{colim} F_i)(U)$. If I could commute these, I know how to finish this, because ""filtered colimits commute with cohomology."" (The Cech complex for the $\operatorname{colim} F_i$ is the colimit of the Cech complexes of $F_i$, so the cohomology for the Cech complex for $colim F_i$ is the colimit of the cohomology for the Cech complexes of $F_i$.) I don't think I especially care about non Noetherian things right now, but I feel that I should know how to fix this. Edit: I think this is probably actually very simple, and I am just getting characteristically confused: For the open affine $U$ sets in the covering, I think probably $colim (F_i(U)) = (colim F_i)(U)$. This should be because any cover of $U$ can be refined to a finite cover, and for some abstract nonsense reason filtered colimits commute with finite products ( https://mathoverflow.net/questions/57099/why-do-filtered-colimits-commute-with-finite-limits ) It's not completely clear to me how to write that out. Is it  the case if $X$ is quasi-compact, then $\Gamma(X, \operatorname{colim} F_i) = \operatorname{colim} \Gamma(X,F_i)$? ** Edit: So here is the confusing thing: Suppose that $U_a$ is some cover of $U$ (quasi compact), and $U_i$ is some finite subcover. Let $F$ be a presheaf, and suppose the exactness of (1) $0 \to F(U) \to \Pi F(U_i) \to \Pi F(U_{i,i'})$. (In the previous set up, this exactness would come from the colimit commuting with finite products.) Then does it follow that (2) $0 \to F(U) \to \Pi F(U_a) \to \Pi F(U_{a, a'})$ is exact? (Which would tell us that the colimit presheaf is already a sheaf.) The map $F(U) \to \Pi F(U_a)$ is clearly still injective (because $\Pi F(U_i)$ injects in $\Pi F(U_a)$). What seems unclear is this: if $f_a$ is in the kernel at the second slot, from the data of the $f_i$ (and the $U_{ij}$) we get an $f \in F(U)$ with the property that $f|_{U_i} = f_i$. However, this $f$ only has $f|_{U_a \cap U_i} = f_a|_{U_a \cap U_i}$, for the cover $U_{ia}$ of $U_a$. But $F$ is not known to be separated, so it is not clear that then $f|_{U_a} = f_a$. If $U_a$ is quasi-compact, then we can use that $I$ is filtered to get that the canonical map $\operatorname{colim} (F_i(U_a) ) \to ( \operatorname{colim}  F_i) (U_a)$ is injective, i.e. the colimit presheaf is already ""separated"" over $U_a$. From this $f|_{U_a \cap U_i} = f_a|_{U_a \cap U_i}$ implies that $f|_{U_a} = f_a$, hence (2) is exact. So here is where we need the space to be Noetherian in order to conclude. I'm confused. (Final edit): If it is known that all finite covers of $U$ give exact sequences (which would be true in the filtered colimit situation), then one can apply the method of adding $U_a$ back to the finite cover to obtain that $f|_{U_a} = f_a$. The second bolded question should be true (provided the limits are filtered.) So I think Noetherianity is not necessary, because all of the covers used in computing Cech cohomology are quasi compact, so their sections are the colimits of the sections.

After letting them move independently, my goal is to find the best rotation of the original configuration to try to match the current state.  This is for a soft body physics simulation, the idea being that if I can construct an optimal 'rigid' frame for the deformed shape then I can apply a shape matching constraint that removes deformation without introducing energy. Existing solutions tend to find the optimal linear transformation representing the deformation, and then use various methods to decompose the matrix into rotation and scale/shear components.  However, I found the orientations provided by such methods tended to not be very stable.  After significant searching I discovered that my problem was identical to a problem solved by NASA to determine satellite orientations.  When I implemented their solution my simulation was remarkably stable.  I want to gain a better understanding of why it works. Details of Davenport's Q-method are here .  Somehow, after taking a bunch of outer, cross and dot products of the original and deformed samples, jamming them into a symmetric 4x4 matrix, and then computing the eigenbasis for that matrix, the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue can be reinterpreted as a quaternion that is the best orientation to use.

Munkres, 2nd edition: Let $\{ A_\alpha \}$ be a collection of subsets of $X$; let $X = \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha$. Let $f \colon X \to Y$: suppose that $f | A_\alpha$ is continuous for each $\alpha$. (a) Show that if the collection $\{A_\alpha \}$ is finite and each set $A_\alpha$ is closed, then $f$ is continuous. [ I have managed to show this! ] (b) Find an example where the collection $\{ A_\alpha \}$ is countable and each $A_\alpha$is closed, but $f$ is not continuous. [Example found easily!] (c) An indexed family of sets $\{ A_\alpha \}$ is said to be locally finite if each point $x$ of $X$ has a nieghborhood that intersects $A_\alpha$ for only finitely many values of $\alpha$. Show that if the family $\{ A_\alpha \}$ is locally finite and each $A_\alpha$ is closed, then $f$ is continuous. It is part (c) that stumps me. My Attempt at Part (c): Let $B$ be a closed set in $Y$. We need to show that $f^{-} (B)$ is closed in $X$. Let $A \colon= f^{-1}(B)$. Then 
  $$A = \bigcup_\alpha \left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1} (B).$$
  Now since $f | A_\alpha$ is continuous for each $\alpha$, each set $\left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1} (B)$ is closed in $A_\alpha$ and hence is closed in $X$. Suppose that $x \in X - A$. Then $x$ has a neighborhood $U$ (i.e. an open set $U$ containing $x$) that intersects only finitely many of the sets in the collection $\{A_\alpha \}$. Let $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ be the values of the indices $\alpha$ for which $U$ intersects the sets $A_\alpha$. Since $x \not\in A$, therefore $x \not\in \left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1} (B)$ for any $\alpha$. So $\left( f|A_\alpha \right) (x) \not\in B$ for any $\alpha$. But as $X = \bigcup_\alpha A_\alpha$, so $x \in A_\alpha$ for some $\alpha$, and so $f(x) = \left( f|A_\alpha \right) (x) $ for some $\alpha$. But $x$ can only belong to one of the sets $A_{\alpha_1}, \ldots, A_{\alpha_n}$. So $f(x) = \left( f | A_{\alpha_i} \right) (x)$ for some $i \in \{ i , \ldots, n\}$. Thus we can conclude that $f(x) \not\in B$. Let $S_i \colon= \left( f | A_{\alpha_i} \right)^{-1} (B)$. Then $x \not\in S_i$ for any $i$. Since the sets $\left( f | A_{\alpha_i} \right)^{-1} (B)$ are closed in $X$, we can conclude that, for each $i$, the point $x$ has a neighborhood $U_i$ such that $U_i \cap S_i = \emptyset$. Let $V \colon= U \cap U_1 \cap \ldots \cap U_n$. Then $V$ is a neighborhood of $x$ and if $v \in V$, then $v \in U$ so that $v \in A_{\alpha_i}$ only for some $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and $v \in U_i$ so that $v \not\in S_i$ for any $i = 1, \ldots, n$. Also then $v \not\in A_\alpha$ for any $\alpha \neq \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$. Is my reasoning so far correct? How to show from here  that $v \not\in A$? P.S.: My Attempt at Part (c) Contd.: Now if this $v$ were to lie in $A$, then $v$ would have to lie in some set $\left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1}(B)$ for some $\alpha$. But as each set $\left( f | A_\alpha \right)^{-1}(B)$ is contained in $A_\alpha$ and as $v$ cannot be in any set $A_\alpha$ for any $\alpha$ different from one of the $\alpha_i$, so we can conclude that if $v$ were to lie in $A$, then $v$ would have to be in one of the sets $\left( f | A_{\alpha_i} \right)^{-1}(B) = S_i$ for some $i = 1, \ldots, n$. But as $v$ is in $U_i$ and $U_i \cap S_i = \emptyset$ for each $i$, so $v$ cannot be in $S_i$ for any $i$. Thus $v$ cannot be in $A$, which implies that $v \in X-A$, showing that the open set $U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n \subset X-A$. And $x \in U \cap U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n$ also. Thus every point $x \in X-A$ has a neighborhood disjoint from $A$, which implies that set $X-A$ is open and hence $A$ is closed, as required. Is my proof correct now?

1634849,Inverse (finite group) isomorphism of a certain form exists,"I have been working on something in group theory for a long time and I have one problem that I cannot solve. I have reduced that problem to a conjecture. It takes some work to set it up, but I don't thinks it's that hard to understand. Let $\mathcal G$ be the finite abelian group
$\sum_\limits{i=1}^A \mathbb Z/a_i \mathbb Z.$ We represent an element 
$\bar{\mathbf x} \in \mathcal G$
as a column vector
$\begin{bmatrix}
  \overline{x_1} &
  \overline{x_2} &
  \overline{x_3} &
  \cdots &
  \overline{x_A}
\end{bmatrix}^\text T$
where
$\mathbf x =
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 &
  x_2 &
  x_3 &
  \cdots &
  x_A
\end{bmatrix}^\text T \in \mathbb Z^{A \times 1}$ Define
$D_a = \operatorname{diag}(a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_A)$.
Then, for any two
$\overline{\mathbf x}, \overline{\mathbf y} \in \mathcal G, \,$
$\overline{\mathbf x} = \overline{\mathbf y}$ if and only if there exists a
$\mathbf u \in \mathbb Z^{A \times 1}$
such that
$\mathbf x = \mathbf y + D_a \mathbf u$. Let $\mathcal H$ be a nontrivial subgroup of $\mathcal G$ which can be expressed as an internal direct sum of cycles, 
$$\mathcal H =
  \bigoplus_{j=1}^B \langle \, \overline{\mathbf s_j} \, \rangle.$$
For $j=1 .. B,$ let
$\operatorname{ord}(\, \overline{\mathbf s_j} \,) = b_j$. Let $S =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \mathbf s_1 &
  \mathbf s_2 &
  \mathbf s_3 &
  \cdots &
  \mathbf s_B
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb Z^{A \times B}$
be the matrix formed by the column vectors
$\{\mathbf s_j\}_{j=1}^B$ Define
$D_b = \operatorname{diag}(b_1, b_2, b_3, \dots, b_B)$. Then there exists a matrix
$\widetilde S \in \mathbb Z^{A \times B}$ such that 
$$ S D_b = D_a \widetilde S $$
This is true because each $b_j$ is the smallest positive integer such that, for every $i$, there exists an integer $\tilde s_{ij}$ such that
$b s_{ij} = \tilde s_{ij} a_i \equiv 0 \pmod{a_i}.$ Finally, we get to Conjecture: The matrix
$\begin{bmatrix} \widetilde S \\ -D_b \end{bmatrix}$
has an integer left inverse. This is equivalent to saying that the rows of $\widetilde S$ span $\prod_{j=1}^B \mathbb Z_{b_j}$. It is easy to show that the elements in each column of
$\begin{bmatrix} \widetilde S \\ -D_b \end{bmatrix}$
are relatively prime. But I can't see how to take the next step and create an integer left inverse. Context: The mapping
$f : \prod_{j=1}^B \mathbb Z_{b_j} \to \mathcal H$
defined by
$f(\bar{\mathbf x}) = \overline{S \mathbf x}$
is an (additive group) isomorphism. So there must exists an isomorphism
$\, f^{-1} : \mathcal H \to \prod_{j=1}^B \mathbb Z_{b_j}$ It would be nice if there were a matrix
$T \in \mathbb Z^{B \times A}$
such that 
$f^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf y}) = \overline{T \mathbf y}$,
but this only happens some times. If my conjecture were true, then we would always have 
$T = D_b \widetilde T D_a^{-1} \in \mathbb Q^{B \times A}$
where, for some
$U \in \mathbb Z^{B \times B} $, 
$$\begin{bmatrix} \widetilde T & U \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \widetilde S \\ -D_b \end{bmatrix} = I$$ I tried for a long time to find a counter example with no success, but I also can't prove that
$\begin{bmatrix}
    \widetilde S \\
    -D_b \\
 \end{bmatrix}$
always has a left inverse. NOTES: The expression 
$ S D_b = D_a \widetilde S $
is just the matrix way of expressing that
for $j = 1..B, \operatorname{ord}\mathbf s_j = b_j$ What the function
$F:\mathbb Z^B \to \mathcal H$
defined by 
$F(\bar{\mathbf x}) 
  = \overline{S x}
  = \sum_{j=1}^B x_j \mathbf{\bar s}_j$
is doing is pretty obvious. The problem is that the function is ""too big"" in the sense that any $x_j$ can be replaced by
$x_j + nb_j \; (n \in \mathbb Z)$
without altering the image of 
$\bar{\mathbf x}.$
That periodic redundancy is encapsulated in the function
$f : \prod_{j=1}^B \mathbb Z_{b_j} \to \mathcal H$
defined by
$f(\bar{\mathbf x}) = \overline{S \mathbf x}$.
Here is how you prove that this function is well-defined.
\begin{align}
  \bar{\mathbf x} = \bar{\mathbf y}
  &\implies x = y + D_b u \; (u \in \mathbb Z^{B \times 1})\\
  &\implies Sx = Sy + S D_b u\\
  &\implies Sx = Sy + D_a (\widetilde S u)\\
  &\implies f(\bar{\mathbf x}) = f(\bar{\mathbf y})\\
\end{align} So $f$ is a well-defined isomorphism. Hence there is also an inverse isomorphism 
$f^{-1}:\mathcal H \to \prod_{j=1}^B \mathbb Z_{b_j}$.
Let's assume that there is a rational matrix
$T \in \mathbb Q^{B \times A}$
such that
$f^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf y}) =\overline{Ty}.$
We will show that $f^{-1}$ is well-defined if there exists an integer matrix
$\widetilde T \in \mathbb Z^{B \times A}$ such that
$T D_a = D_b \widetilde T$. \begin{align}
  \bar{\mathbf y} = \bar{\mathbf z}
  &\implies y = z + D_a u \; (u \in \mathbb Z^{A \times 1})\\
  &\implies Ty = Tz + T D_a u\\
  &\implies Ty = Tz + D_b (\widetilde T u)\\
  &\implies f^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf y}) = f^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf z})\\
\end{align} We also need to ensure that, for $j = 1..B$,
$f^{-1}(f(\bar{\mathbf e}_j)) = f^{-1}(\bar{\mathbf s}_j) 
 = \bar{\mathbf e}_j.$
This can all be compressed into
$f^{-1}(f(\overline{I_B})) = \overline{I_B}$. \begin{align}
  f^{-1}(f(\overline{I_B})) &= \overline{I_B} \\
  f^{-1}(\overline S) &= \overline{I_B} \\
  \overline{TS} &= \overline{I_B} \\
  TS &= I_B + D_b U \; (U \in \mathbb Z^{B \times B})\\
  (D_b \widetilde T D_a^{-1})(D_a \widetilde S D_b^{-1}) &= I_B + D_b U \\
  D_b \widetilde T \widetilde S D_b^{-1} &= I_B + D_b U \\
  \widetilde T \widetilde S &= I_B + U D_b \\
  \widetilde T \widetilde S - U D_b &= I_B \\

My start: Let $A \subset X$, $B \subset Y$, and let $A\times B$ be an open subset open in $X\times Y$. Since $A\times B$ is open, then $A\times B = \text{Int}(A\times B)$. I'm stuck in how to proceed. (b) If both $(X,d_{X})$ and $(Y,d_{Y})$ are separable, then $(X\times Y, d_{1})$ is also separable. Suppose that both $(X,d_{X})$ and $(Y,d_{Y})$ are separable. Then, there exists some countable dense subset in each of $X$ and $Y$, say $A$ and $B$, respectively. We claim that $A \times B$ is a countable dense subset of $X\times Y$.

1635250,What are numerical methods of evaluating $P(1 < Z \leq 2)$ for standard normal Z?,"Let $Z \sim Norm(0, 1)$ and denote its PDF and CDF by $\phi$ and $\Phi$ respectively. Then, theoretically, $P(1 < Z \leq 2) = \Phi(2) - \Phi(1).$ However $\Phi$ cannot be expressed in closed form, so some sort of computational method is required to obtain a numerical answer. The traditional method has been to consult tables of of $\Phi$ such as the five place table available online from NIST online, or similar tables available in many textbooks on probability and statistics to obtain $P(1 < Z \leq 2) = 0.47725 - 0.34134 = 0.13591.$
Nowadays, many software packages give such answers. For example, using R one obtains. diff(pnorm(c(1,2)))
  ##  0.1359051 in which pnorm (with default second and third parameters) is a function for computing $\Phi.$ This R function is based on numerical integration. In the initial answer below, our purpose is to illustrate several computational and Monte Carlo methods that have been used to make CDF tables or to program software for finding intervals associated with normal distributions, and a few other commonly occurring distributions. Mostly, our focus is on widely applicable methods that are also useful for practical problems involving a variety continuous distributions.

1635332,Show that $\hat{\theta}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\theta$,"Let $f(x, \theta) = \frac{1}{\theta} x^{\frac{1-\theta}{\theta}}$, where $0 < x < 1$ and $\theta > 0$. Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be iid with density $f$. Taking the log likelihood, I found
$$ l(\theta) = -n\ln{\theta} + \frac{1-\theta}{\theta}\sum_{i=1}^n{\ln{X_i}}  $$
$$ l'(\theta) = -\frac{n}{\theta} - \frac{1}{\theta^2}\sum{\ln{X_i}}$$ Setting $l'(\theta) = 0$ yields the MLE of $$\hat{\theta} = -\frac{1}{n}\sum{\ln(X_i)}$$ But I don't know how to show that $E(\hat{\theta}) = \theta$, i.e. it's an unbiased estimator. I tried taking the estimate of both sides as follows: $$ E(\hat{\theta}) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum{\ln{E(X_i)}} = -\frac{1}{n}\sum{\ln{\frac{1}{1 + \theta}}} = \ln(1 + \theta)$$
where I found $E(X_i)$ as follows: $$ E(X) = \int_0^1{x f(x, \theta) dx} = \frac{1}{\theta}\int_0^1{x^{1/\theta}} = \frac{1}{1 + \theta} x^{\frac{1 + \theta} {\theta}}{\huge\rvert}_0^1 = \frac{1}{1 + \theta}$$ Okay, thanks to @CommongerG for pointing out my mistake in his answer. We have 
$$E(\hat{\theta}) = -\frac{1}{n}\sum{E(\ln{X})} = -E(\ln{X})$$
So I need to show $E(\ln{X}) = -\theta$. Well, $$ E(\ln{X}) = \int_0^1{\ln{x} f(x, \theta) dx} = \theta^{-1}\int_0^1{x^{\frac{1-\theta}{\theta}}\ln{x}dx}$$ Thank you @MlleM for pointing out my calculus error. I finally got the desired result. Letting $u = \ln{x}$ and $dv = \theta^{-1}x^{\frac{1-\theta}{\theta}} dx$, we have $du = \frac{dx}{x}$ and $v = x^{\frac{1}{\theta}}$. Then this solves as: $$ E(\ln{X}) = x^{\frac{1}{\theta}}\ln(x){\large\rvert}_0^1 - \int_0^1{x^{\frac{1}{\theta}}dx}{\huge\rvert}_0^1 = 0 - \theta x^{\frac{1}{\theta}} {\huge\rvert}_0^1 = - \theta$$","['maximum-likelihood', 'statistics', 'log-likelihood', 'proof-verification']"

1635402,Probability of every ball occurring in multiple independent random samples,"An urn contains 5 distinct numbered balls. You choose 2 without replacement. You then reset the urn and choose another 2 without replacement. Do this one more time. Now you have three random samples of size 2. What is the probability that all of the numbered balls appear at least once in your 3 random samples of size 2? My thinking of a way to approach this is through complements. Finding the probability one of the balls is missing, two, and three. Then subtracting all of these scenarios from one. Is this a solid approach? Here is the work: P(all numbered balls appear at least once) = 1 - P(at least one ball is missing) P(at least one ball is missing) = P(one ball missing) + P(two balls are missing) + P(three balls are missing) I found the probabilities of one ball, two balls, and three balls missing to be the following: P(one ball missing) = $$\left(1*{4 \choose 2}/{5 \choose2}\right)^2$$ P(two balls missing) = $$\left(1*{3 \choose 2}/{5 \choose2}\right)^2$$ P(three ball missing) = $$\left(1*{2 \choose 2}/{5 \choose2}\right)^2$$ This is because the first time you can choose any three balls, in the one ball missing case, you can only choose two balls from four when there are five possible balls. You can choose either the two that are original or any combination with a different arbitrary two but one must be left out. This is true for both random samples following the first.

1635406,Locally square integrable (local) martingales,"I'm reading Protter and sometimes he says ""locally square integrable martingale"", and sometimes he says ""locally square integrable local martingale"", and I wonder if these two are the same. Protter's definition is a property holds locally for $X$ if there are $T_n$ increasing to $\infty$ such that $X^{T_n}1_{T_n>0}$ has the property. Then a local martingale is an adapted cadlag $X$ which is locally a martingale. Protter also proves that a cadlag $X$ which is locally a local martingale is a local martingale. Now I try to parse ""locally square integrable local martingale"". If $X$ is such that it is locally a square integrable local martingale, in particular $X$ is locally a local martingale, and hence is a local martingale. Thus the question reduces to is ""(locally square integrable) + (local martginale) = locally (square integrable martingale)""? I think they are the same because if $T_n$ makes $X^{T_n}1_{T_n>0}$ a martingale, and $S_n$ makes $X^{S_n}1_{S_n>0}$ square integrable, then $T_n \wedge S_n$ should make $X^{T_n \wedge S_n}1_{T_n \wedge S_n > 0}$ a square integrable martingale.
