2228398,'Trace trick' for expectations of quadratic forms,"I am trying to understand the proof for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions . On the way, a sort of trace trick is applied for the expectation of the quadratic form $$E[ (x-\mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu) ]= \operatorname{trace}(E[(x-\mu)(x-\mu)^T)] \Sigma^{-1}),$$ where $x$ is MV-normal with mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ . The expectation is taken over $x$ . I would like to understand why this identity holds. I think more than one step is taken at once. I believe, $\operatorname{trace}(E[(x-\mu)(x-\mu)^T] \Sigma^{-1})$ = $\operatorname{trace}(E[(x-\mu) \Sigma^{-1} (x-\mu)^T])$ , but where does the trace come from?","['matrices', 'trace', 'statistics', 'expected-value']"
2228415,questions about double centralizer theorem,"An important fact in the theory of central simple algebras is the double centralizer theorem, which says: if $k$ is a field, $A$ is a $k$-algebra, $V$ is a faithful semisimple $A$-algebra, then $C(C(A)) = A$, where $C(A)$ is the centralizer of $A$ in $End_k(V)$. Taking the centralizer is an inclusion-reversing operation. If we consider the algebra $M_n(k)$ of $n\times n$ matrices over a field $k$, identfying $k$ with the scalar matrices and $\Delta$ with the diagonal matrices, we get $C(k)$ = $M_n(k)$, $C(M_n(k)) = k$, and $C(\Delta) = \Delta$. (1) This suggests that the centralizer operation is something like a duality between $k$-subalgebras. Is there any truth to this? (2) Will there always be a subalgebra like $\Delta$ which is its own centralizer? I'm not exactly sure what conditions to put on $k, A$, and $V$, so I'm open to flexibility on that. (3) Does a double centralizer result hold in the context of groups? (i.e. $C_G(C_G(H)) = H$?). If not in general, for what groups does this hold?","['abstract-algebra', 'division-algebras', 'representation-theory']"
2228418,Find the sum of all primitive roots of $n$,"Let $\xi_n$ denote a primitive $n^{th}$ root of unity and let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\xi)$ be the associated cyclotomic field.

It is actually the I know that the trace of $\xi_n$ from $K$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ is the sum of all primitive roots of $n$. If $n=1$, it is very easy. I know the fact that $a$ is a primitive root of $n$, then $-a$ is a primitive of $n$ as well if $n$ is divisible by the square of a prime. How to prove that? This is the key to prove the second case.

2228457,Standard notation for expressing a certain binary operation between functions,"Given two functions whose outputs coincide at all values in the intersection of their domains, is there some commonly used notation to express the function whose graph is formed by the union of both those function's graphs? Symbolically given any two functions $f:A\to X$ and $g:B\to Y$ with $f(r)=g(r)$ for all $r\in A\cap B$ I'm looking for some standard notation to write the function $h:A\cup B\to X\cup Y$ defined by: $$h(r)=\begin{cases} f(r)& \text{if } r\in A\\ g(r)& \text{if } r\in B\end{cases}$$ So far I've just been writing $h=f\cup g$, as this notation seems pretty natural and also satisfies a lot of nice properties involving the standard usage of the union operator between sets. For example: $$f\cup g=g\cup f$$
 $$(f\cup g)\cup h=f\cup (g\cup h)$$
 $$\text{dom}(f\cup g)=\text{dom}(f)\cup \text{dom}(g)$$
 $$\text{range}(f\cup g)=\text{range}(f)\cup \text{range}(g)$$
 $$(f\cup g)[U]=f[U\cap A]\cup g[U\cap B] \text{ for any subset } U\subseteq A\cup B$$
 $$\text{ If } f \text{ and } g \text{ are bijective then so is } f\cup g \text{ further we have } (f\cup g)^{-1}=f^{-1}\cup g^{-1}$$ In particular a recent example of where this notation would have been useful, was when I was dealing with three functions $f:A\to X$ and $g:B\to Y$ and $h:C\to Z$ as well as two binary operations $*$ on $A\times B$ to $C$ and $\cdot$ on $X\times Y$ to $Z$ which satisfied: $$h(a*b)=f(a)\cdot g(b)$$ Now using the previous notation this is equivalent to the identity: $$(f\cup g\cup h)(a*b)=(f\cup g\cup h)(a)\cdot (f\cup g\cup h)(b)$$ Thus instead of writing all the aforementioned relations I could have just more concisely wrote that $f\cup g\cup h$ is a homomorphism from $(*,A\times B)$ to $(\cdot,X\times Y)$. However for the sake of communicability I'm hesitant to define the ""union"" of functions in the way that I did and so I'm curious if there is some standard notation for expressing this binary operation between arbitrary functions.","['abstract-algebra', 'functions', 'elementary-set-theory', 'binary-operations', 'graphing-functions']"
2228474,Two-variable polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$ with finitely many roots in $\mathbb{R}^2$,"I found this interesting exercise (not homework assignment) in real algebraic geometry: Describe an algorithm which decides whether a given polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[X, Y]$ has infinitely or finitely many roots in $\mathbb{R}^2$. There's not much I've found already. It's easy to construct a polynomial with a given number of roots, for example
$$
X^2 + \prod_{k=1}^n (Y - k)^2
$$
has exactly $n$ roots in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The idea used is that any system of polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[X, Y]$ having finitely many solutions (in this case $\lbrace X = 0, \prod_{k=1}^n (Y - k) = 0 \rbrace$) can be converted into one polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[X, Y]$ having exactly those solutions as roots using sums of squares. However, not all polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[X, Y]$ can be written as a sum of squares (or minus a sum of squares), provided that they have finitely many roots. For example, it is well-known that the Motzkin polynomial $F = X^4Y^2 + X^2Y^4 - 3X^2Y^2 + 1$ cannot be written as a sum of squares in $\mathbb{R}[X, Y]$, but on the other hand the polynomial
$$
(1 + X^2)F = (1 - X^2Y^2)^2 + X^2(1 - Y^2)^2 + X^2Y^2(1 - X^2)^2
$$
has exactly the same roots in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as $F$, namely $(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)$ and $(-1, -1)$. The above equality also shows that $F$ only takes positive values. In fact, using the middle value theorem, one can easily see that if a polynomial in $\mathbb{R}[X, Y]$ can take both strictly negative and strictly positive values, it must have infinitely many zeroes in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Conversely, though, some polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[X, Y]$ never take negative values and still have infinitely many zeroes. Any thoughts on this? Both hints and full answers are welcome.","['real-algebraic-geometry', 'roots', 'polynomials', 'algebraic-geometry']"

By integrable path we mean a path that has its coordinates as integrable functions. It's intuitive to say that since it has a ""finite graph"" then it should be integrable.

Here is my approach. I try to use change coordinates method. notice $(u_x, u_y)$ $\cdot$ (1, 1)=1

Then $""u_x = u_{x_1} + u_{y_1}, u_y= u_{x_1} - u_{y_1}$

2228556,Alternative way to find if an infinite set is countable,"I'm studying about countable and uncountable sets, and I have found that 
an infinite set is countable if and only if its possible to find a bijective relation between that set and the set of natural numbers. I got a bit confused thinking the way of the definition above, so I thought of another way to find if a set
is countable or uncountable. I'm not sure if it's correct so I would like to get some help. An infinite set S is countable if and only if: Given any ordering relation that covers all the elements of S: for each pair (e1, e2) of elements of S,
it is always possible, starting from e1, to reach e2 by counting the elements between e1 and e2 one by one
(the same if starting from e2 and going towards e1). This way I can prove that P(N) is uncountable by establishing an order relation that states all the subsets of N that are elements of P(N) and have cardinality 'c' are located in the left of all of those that have cardinality 'c+1'. So I can start from, for example, {1}, and knowing that {1,2} is in some place to the right of {1}, even if I try to reach {1,2} from {1} counting element by element to the right, I will never, so P(N) is uncountable. I thought this way because it's easier for me to undersand, but I'm not sure if I'm right.","['infinity', 'elementary-set-theory']"

I'd like to show that $P_1 \wedge P_2 \neq 0$. I know that $P_1 \wedge P_2$ is defined for all $B \in \mathcal{B}$ by 
$$(P_1 \wedge P_2)(B) = \inf\{P_1(A) + P_2(B-A): A \subseteq B, A \in \mathcal{B} \},$$

2228597,Combinatorics problem using inclusion/exclusion on matching pairs,"There are 5 different pairs of shoes. How many ways are there for 5 people to each choose 2 shoes with no one getting a matching pair? So I think this is a inclusion/exclusion problem.

If $X$ is now projective, we know that $H^q(X,\Omega_X^p)$ is dual to $H^{n-q}(X, \Omega_X^n \otimes \wedge^p T_X )$.
I would like to then deduce the identity of Hodge numbers above by saying that $\Omega_X^{n-p}$ is isomorphic to $\Omega_X^n \otimes \wedge^p T_X$ but I don't know why that should be true.

2228685,Generalization of Fuchs' Theorem for Differential Equations,"I am familiar with the method of Frobenius for solving second order linear DEs and have found a number of references to it online. To recap, it allows us to solve a DE like $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + p(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = 0$ with power series near a regular singular point assuming that p(x) and q(x) have poles of order at most 1 and 2 respectively. Fuchs' Theorem tells us that this method will always produce at least one answer. And I'm wondering if there is an analog to Fuchs' theorem to higher order linear DEs that anyone knows about and has a proof for. If we consider a higher order DE, $\frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}} + p_{n-1}(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}} + \cdots + p_{1}(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + p_{0}(x)y = 0$, we could begin to generalize the method. I imagine a singular point $x_{0}$ is called regular if $(x-x_0)^k p_{n-k}(x)$ is analytic for all $k = 1, 2, \cdots, n$. For this particular DE we would get an indical equation $r(r-1)\cdots (r-n+1) + r(r-1)\cdots (r-n+2)p_{n-1} + \cdots + p_{0} = 0$ where $p_k = lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}p_{k}(x)$ for each $k = 0, 1, \cdots, n-1$. Using solutions for $r$ we could then consider and work with solutions $y = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n (x-x_0)^{n+r}$. This seems like it would logically work, but I can't find much literature on this sort of generalization. I have only found one reference to this generalization at http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/sciencepublications/jmssp/2005/3-7.pdf and am curious as to whether there are others, perhaps an actual proof of these results and a characterization of the solutions in terms of the multiplicity of the solutions of the indical equation and their differences.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

2228704,Find all solutions to $x^2+54=y^3$ over the integers,"Find all solutions to $x^2+54=y^3$ over the integers. Hint: the ideal class group order of $\mathcal{O}_{-6}$, $h_{\sqrt{-6}}=2$. $$\\$$
First we note that if $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, then $R=\mathcal{O}_K=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-6}]$, and by some theorem, since $-6\equiv2 \pmod4$, then the ideal $(2)_R$ ramifies into $\mathfrak{p}_2^2$, where $\mathfrak{p}_2=(2,\sqrt{-6})_R$, which cannot be a principal ideal since there is no solution to $a^2+6b^2=2$ over the integers. Hence the class group $Cl(R)=\{e,[\mathfrak{p}_2]\}$, since its order is 2. We can factorise so that if $\alpha =x+3\sqrt{-6}$, then $\alpha\tilde{\alpha}=y^3$. Now, note that $2\nmid x$ (otherwise $2|y\Rightarrow 4|54=2\cdot3^3$, contradiction), so $2\nmid y$. This means that $(y)_R^3\sim e $, since otherwise we would have $\mathfrak{p}_2|(y)_R^3\Rightarrow \mathfrak{p}_2^2|(y)_R^3$ which we cannot have by the above. Hence $(\alpha\tilde\alpha)_R\sim (y)_R^3\sim e$. This in turn implies that in the maximal ideal decomposition of $(\alpha)_R$, we cannot have a factor of $\mathfrak{p}_2$, and so $(\alpha)_R\sim(\tilde\alpha)_R\sim e$. Then we can write $(\alpha)_R=\prod_{i=1}^n\mathfrak{q}_i^{r_i}$ for $\mathfrak{q}_i\nsim\mathfrak{p}_2$ maximal ideals. We can now deduce that $3|r_i\;\; \forall i$, so that we can write $(\beta)_R=\prod_{i=1}^n\mathfrak{q}_i^{r_i/3}$ with $(\beta)^3_R=(\alpha)_R$. As both are principal ideals, we can write $\beta^3=\alpha=x+3\sqrt{-6}$ for some $a+b\sqrt{-6}=\beta\in R$. Solving this equation by comparing coefficients we get that: $\beta^3=a(a^2-18b^2)+3b(a^2-2b^2)\sqrt{-6}=x+3\sqrt{-6}\Rightarrow b(a^2-2b^2)=3$, and we get that the only solution is $b=-1,a=\pm 1\Rightarrow x=\pm17\Rightarrow y=7$.

2228942,Ring homomorphism: Prove the image is a subring,"I was given the following question (in my undergraduate Abstract Algebra module): Let $f:R\to S$ be a ring homomorphism. Prove that: the image of $f$ is a subring of $S$ if $R$ is a ring with unity and $f$ is surjective. The following is my attempt: The image of $f=\{s\in S\mid s=f(r)$  for some $r\in R\}$.
Let $x,y\in R$ and  $f(x), f(y)\in f(R)$ $$f(x)-f(y)=f(x-y)$$ 
$x-y\in R$ (since $R$ is a group). Thus the image of $f$ is closed under subtraction. $$f(x)*f(y)=f(xy)        $$
$xy\in R$ (since $R$ is a group).
Thus the image of $f$ is closed under multiplication. Therefore the image of $f$ is a subring of $S$. Is this even correct? I never used the fact that $R$ is a ring with unity and that $f$ is surjective so it is confusing me? Thank you.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"

Therefore , the surjection of a finite ring into $\frac{O_K}{\mathfrak{p}}$ implies both rings are finite. But $\frac{O_K}{\mathfrak{p}}$ is a finite integral domain, therefore a field, therefore $\mathfrak{p}$ is a maximal ideal. In short, every quotient of $O_K$ by an ideal is finite, so prime ideals must be maximal.

2229117,Why is Normalizer-Centralizer (N/C) Theorem valid only for subgroups?,I have a few queries regarding the normalizer/centralizer theorem and I would prefer a response suitable for a beginner. Suppose that $G$ is a group and $S \subseteq G$ then we know that both $N_{G}(S)$ and $C_{G}(S)$ are subgroups of $G$ and in particular $C_{G}(S)$ is a normal subgroup of $N_{G}(S)$. The N/C theorem only deals with the case when the subset $S$ is actually a subgroup of $G$ and not just any subset of $G$. The quotient $N(S)/G(S)$ makes sense for arbitrary subsets $S$ of $G$. Why does the $N/C$ theorem not deal with such subsets $S$? One obvious reason is that we can't talk about $Aut(S)$ unless $S$ itself is a group. But apart from that is there any other specific reason to choose $S$ as a subgroup of $G$? Or perhaps the quotient $N/C$ is interesting enough (i.e. it provides valuable information about $S$) only when $S$ is a subgroup. Next consider the usual N/C theorem: $$\frac{N_{G}(H)}{C_{G}(H)} \cong K \leq Aut(H)$$ where $H\leq G$. Now the members of $K$ are inner automorphisms of $G$ based on conjugation by members of $N_{G}(H)$ i.e. $K \subseteq Inn(G)$. The only reason this $K$ is also a subset of $Aut(H)$ is because members of $K$ are conjugation via members of $N_{G}(H)$. Is my understanding about $K$ above correct? Also does $K \leq Inn(G)$?,"['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

I know how to divide a rectangle into some number of rectangles, but my current situation is making it difficult to visualize how many rectangles should I divide it into. Let me explain the scenario - I've been given a large rectangle with n number of uniformly distributed points inside it and I've to make smaller rectangles so that each rectangle has ~10^3-10^4 points in it. The n can vary easily from 10^5 - 10^8 and even above. My idea is to cluster those points into smaller rectangles so that I don't have to compare all points linearly and just compare their bounding rectangles to the geometric figure. So in earlier case, I would be comparing millions of points for each geometric figure, now I would be comparing much much less number of bounding rectangles. For now I've hardcoded the values eg. 1000 smaller rectangles for 10^6 number of points and like that for 10^7 and 10^8. But it has a disadvantage that instead of calculating for continuous range, I'm hard coding for discrete range which does not work for 5000000 number of points or any such in middle. Also, they are usually made into thin strips which makes them very hard to fall completely within the geometric shape I'm comparing with. I hope I've explained it clearly, but I'll provide a TLDR; Given a rectangle with n number of points uniformly distributed inside it, split that rectangle into smalle rectangles with 10^3-10^4 number of points in each of them. Also, the naive solution like dividing into very slim strips does not work for me because then most strips only intersect with geometric figure rather than falling within it completely, it would be preferable for an algorithm/function to make somewhat both axis uniform boxes. ________                           ________

So, my next guess is that it means that, in some choices of local frame $e_i$, the matrix $\omega_i^j(v)$ is skew-symmetric for any $v$. Orthormal frame is the probable condition. But this would mean, in particular, that each $\nabla e_i$ is skew-symmetric, since if $v = e_i$, there are no nonconstant components of $v$ to worry about, and '$\nabla = \omega$'.

2229343,Find uncountable set of functions from countable set agreeing only in finite subsets,"(Sorry for the terrible title, but I couldn't come up with a reasonable description of the problem with words.) The problem: Let $I$ be a countably infinite set and $A$ be an infinite set. Prove that there exist $S \subseteq A^I$ such that $|S|=\aleph_1$ and for $f,g \in S$, if $f \neq g$ then $\{ i \in I : f(i) = g(i) \}$ is finite. Show that, if $U$ is a free ultrafilter over $I$, then $|A^I/U| \geq \aleph_1$. (Here, the quotient is over the equivalence relation $\sim_U$ given by $a \sim_U b$ iff $\{ i \in I : a(i) = b(i) \} \in U$). I am allowed to use the Continuum Hypothesis. Partial resolution: Given the result of the first part, the second one is easy to prove. If $U$ is a free ultrafilter over $I$, then all the cofinite sets of $I$ belong to $U$, and therefore, no finite subset of $I$ belongs to $U$. So, $a/U \neq b/U$ whenever $\{ i \in I : a(i) = b(i)\}$ is finite, and thus, each member of $S$ represents a different class of $\sim_{U}$, that is, a different element of $A^{I}/U$, so that $|A^I/U| \geq |S| = \aleph_1$. Tentative of solving the first part: If $A$ is uncountable, then $|A| \geq \aleph_1$ and so we can take a subset $B$ of $A$ with $|B| = \aleph_1$ and the $S$ to be the constant functions from $I$ to $B$. Suppose $A$ is countable.
In this case, I though I could parametrize a family of functions from $I$ to $A$ more or less like $c_{a,J}$, for $a \in A$ and $J$ a finite subset of $I$, by making
$$c_{a,J}(i) = 
\begin{cases}
a &\text{ if } i \in J,\\
\phi(i) &\text{ if } i \notin J.
\end{cases}$$
where $\phi$ would be a function from $I$ to $A$ that would suit the required conditions. (The reason for which $J$ must be finite is that otherwise we could have $J,J'$ for the same $a \in A$, so that $c_{a,J}$ and $c_{a,J'}$ could agree in an infinite subset of $I$, although being different.) But on a second though I realized that this family is not large enough, because, since there are only as many finite subsets of $I$ as members of $I$, there are only $|I| \cdot |A|$ such functions, that is, we would have $|S| = \aleph_0$.",['elementary-set-theory']

Then there exists a $x^* := (x^*_{1}, \dots , x^*_n)$ on the line segment between $x$ and $x'$ such that $$ f(x) - f(x') = \sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*) (x - x').$$ Proof: Apply the Mean Value Theorem found in any calculus book to the function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ and use the Chain Rule:
  $$ \frac{d f(tx + (1-t)x')}{dt} \Bigg|_{t = t^*} = %
\sum^{n}_{i = 1} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*) \frac{d (tx_i + (1-t)x'_i)}{dt} \Bigg|_{t = t^*} = %

  with $x^* := t^* x + (1 - t^* )x' $. I have the following problems. Why $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ is defined on $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ ? I think it should rather be defined on $[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ (i.e., it should be convex and not affine), since we want to capture that $x^* \in f(t^* x + (1 - t^* )x')$ for some $t^* \in [0,1]$. If $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ is defined on $[0,1]$ then I can almost get what happens in the equation. That is, things should work as follows: start from $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$ and apply calculus Mean Value Theorem getting
\begin{align}
\frac{f(x) - f(x')}{?} & = \frac{df}{dt} (t^*) \\
& = \sum^{n}_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} (x^*).

Notice that at the denominator on the LHS I put a question mark because I don't see how it should work. We should get $(x - x')$, but I don't really see how. Or better, I see it, if the denominator works as
$$ (1x + (1-1)x' - 0x + (1-0)x' ),$$ which is indeed equal to $(x - x')$, but to me this is not clear at all. Indeed it should simply be equal to $1$, because we are acting on the domain of $t \mapsto f(tx + (1-t)x')$, that should be just $[0, 1]$, not on its codomain. [The RHS should be OK, since we have that there is a $t^*$ and then we use it to define $x^*$.] How should this actually work? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated since I am self-taught and I think I never really got how these analysis proofs with differentiation actually work.

Thus $\nabla_{f'(t_0)}\tilde V=0$, and thus the required covariant derivative is also $0$. This is not the right answer, for Problem 6 of Chapter 2 of Do Carmo's Riemannian Geometry asks to prove that the covariant derivative is same as the derivative of the smooth map $V:I\to T_pM$, which might not be $0$. I am unable to locate my mistake.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Assume that $X$ is a set and $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ is a collection of subsets of $X$. Assume also that for every $i\in I$, there is a topology $\mathcal{T}_i$ defined on $X_i$. We say that a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$ is consistent with the family $(X_i,\mathcal{T}_i)_{i\in I}$ if the induced topology by $\mathcal{T}$ on $X_i$ is exactly $\mathcal{T}_i$ for every $i\in I$. Consistent topologies may or may not exist. And if they exist, there might be a unique consistent topology, or there might be more than one. It is easy to check the following facts: If consistent topologies exist, then the finest consistent topology is given by $$\mathcal{T}=\{U\subset X:\; U\cap X_i\in\mathcal{T}_i,\;\forall i\in I\}.$$ A necessary condition for the existence of consistent topologies is the pairwise compatibility of the topologies $(\mathcal{T}_i)_{i\in I}$, i.e., it must be the case that for every $i,j\in I$, the topology induced by $\mathcal{T}_i$ on $X_i\cap X_j$ must be the same as the topology induced by $\mathcal{T}_j$ on $X_i\cap X_j$. The above condition becomes sufficient if the spaces $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ are an increasing sequence, i.e., if $I=\mathbb{N}$ and $X_n\subset X_{n+1}$ for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Is the above necessary condition also sufficient in general for arbitrary collection of subspaces? if not, is there a known necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of consistent topologies?

Question: Write $z=re^{i\theta}$, where $0<r<1$, in the summation formula $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n=\dfrac{1}{1-z}$$ whenever $|z|<1$. Then, with the aid of the following theorem, Suppose that $z_n=x_n+iy_n$ ($n=1,2,\dots$) and $S=X+iY$. Then
  $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty z_n=S \text{ if and only if }\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n=X \text{ and } \sum_{n=1}^\infty y_n=Y$$ show that

Proof: Let $z=re^{i\theta}$, where $0<r<1$. Recall $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty z^n=\dfrac{1}{1-z}$$ whenever $|z|<1$. Replace $z$ by $re^{i\theta}$ in the summation. $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(re^{i\theta}\right)^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^ne^{i\theta n}=\dfrac{1}{1-re^{i\theta}}$$ whenever $\left|re^{i\theta}\right|<1$.

\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^ne^{i\theta n} =\dfrac{1}{1-r\cos\theta-ir\sin\theta} =\dfrac{1-r\cos\theta+ir\sin\theta}{((1-r\cos\theta)-ir\sin\theta)((1-r\cos\theta)+ir\sin\theta)}=\dfrac{1-r\cos\theta+ir\sin\theta}{(1-r\cos\theta)^2+(r\sin\theta)^2}=\dfrac{1-r\cos\theta+ir\sin\theta}{1-2r\cos\theta+r^2\cos^2\theta+r^2\sin^2\theta}=\dfrac{1-r\cos\theta+ir\sin\theta}{1-2r\cos\theta+r^2}

2230232,Applications of valuation rings,"Some background: I am in the process of writing a research paper for an undergraduate abstract algebra course. I've chosen to write my paper on valuation rings and discrete valuation rings. The goal of the paper is to broaden my own and my classmates' understanding of abstract algebra by independently researching a topic not covered in the course. So far, my paper consists of surveying the properties of valuation rings and giving examples of valuation rings. What I would like to know: I would like to be able to comment on how valuation rings are utilized in various fields of mathematics. Thus far I've had a hard time finding examples that are both explicit and accessible to me, as all of the literature I've found on valuation rings have been graduate texts. It seems like valuation rings are often used in number theory and algebraic geometry, but how are they applied in those fields? What other fields find valuation rings of significant usefulness, and how are they applied? I would also find so-called real world applications useful for my understanding of the topic, but personally I'm more interested in how mathematicians make use of them. Assume I know linear and abstract algebra at an undergraduate level. Do not assume I know very much about geometry, number theory, or analysis. I'm currently taking a differential geometry course, but what I'm learning seems entirely separate from anything I've seen relating valuation rings to geometry. My apologies for the broad question. Please let me know if I can clarify or specify in any way.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'valuation-theory', 'applications']"
2230247,What is the linear algebra of the Schur complement?,"I am interested in the combinatorics of electrical networks, and this leads naturally into the notion of the Schur complement: Suppose we have a graph (possibly edge-weighted with 'resistances') with ""boundary"" and ""interior"" verticesâ€” the idea is that we get to have control over the voltages on the boundary, but not on the interior. The graph, being a graph, has a Laplacian matrix $L=D-A$ . It turns out that the Schur complement of the Laplacian with respect to the internal vertices (thus, a square matrix of side length the number of boundary vertices) has electrical significance. Namely, this is the so-called ""response matrix"" which takes in a vector of voltages and spits out the corresponding vector of current: how much electricity will flow through the boundary vertices. Regardless of application: I don't like matrices. I like linear maps (and I'm fine with bases). Is there any way for someone like me to think about the Schur complement without going all the way down to matrix-land?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'schur-complement']"
2230255,supremum of expectation $\le$ expectation of supremum?,"Suppose that $X$ is an arbitrary random variable, is the following is true for any function $f$: 
$$\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\big[f(X,y)\big] \le \mathbb E\big[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\big]?$$ If $f$ is convex in $X$, then the inequality clearly holds, since the supremum of a family of convex functions is still convex.  If $f$ is not convex in $X$, I think the inequality still holds for the following reason: For any realization of $X$ and any value of $y$, we have $f(X,y) \le \underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)$.  Therefore, for any $y$, $\mathbb E\big[f(X,y)\big] \le \mathbb E\big[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\big]$.  In other words, $\mathbb E\big[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\big]$ is an upper bound of the set $\left\{\mathbb E\big[f(X,y)\big]: y\in \mathcal Y\right\}$, so it follows that $\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup \mathbb E\big[f(X,y)\big] \le \mathbb E\big[\underset{y\in \mathcal Y} \sup f(X,y)\big]$. So it appears that convexity of $f$is not needed at all for the inequality to hold. Am I mistaken somewhere?  I'd appreciate it if someone would correct me, if I missed something.

2230301,Interchanging Derivative and Integral Example,"In class the other day, my professor stated the following theorem: Suppose $\frac{d}{dy}f(x,y)$ is continuous on $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, then $\frac{d}{dy} \int^1_0 f(x,y) \, dx = \int_0^1 \frac{d}{dy}f(x,y) \, dx$. He then quickly corrected this to read: Suppose $\frac{d}{dy}f(x,y)$ and f are continuous on $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, then $$\frac{d}{dy} \int^1_0 f(x,y) \, dx = \int_0^1 \frac{d}{dy}f(x,y) \, dx.$$ I was wondering if anyone could provide an example of $f$ which satisfies the conditions for the first statement written but not the subsequently added continuity condition from the second statement, and therefore fails the overall implication of the first statement.",['multivariable-calculus']
2230311,Are quaternions useful as coordinate systems for two-dimensional manifolds?,"I am learning how quaternions work. For that reason I have prepared a coordinate system based on quaternions applied to two-dimensional topological manifolds of the shape of a Klein bottle (it can be adapted easily to others like a MÃ¶bius strip, or a torus for instance). Basically we can represent the Klein bottle by its gluing diagram : And we will add extra information to the points that ""inhabit"" the surface of the manifold. A point of the surface will be represented by a quaternion as follows: $$a+bi+cj+dk$$ Where: $a$ represents the side. Any point of the surface of the bottle has an equivalent point in the internal side, so $a = 0,1$ ( $0$ outer side, $1$ inner side). A point can be in some of the both inner or outer sides. $i$ represents the horizontal position $x$ in the gluing diagram ( $i \in [0,I]$ where $I$ is the length of the Klein bottle diagram) $j$ represents the vertical position $y$ in the gluing diagram ( $i \in [0,J]$ where $J$ is the height of the Klein bottle diagram) Finally, $k$ will be an extra property of the point, in my case I named it the ""spin"", it has $4$ positions, ( $k \in [0,3]$ ). I could be seen as a kind of local orientation associated to the gluing diagram (North,South,East,West). This provides a coordinate system with sum and multiplication. As we are using quaternions, the standard rules of quaternions are applied: $$i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$$ Addition, scalar multiplication and quaternion multiplication are available and the quaternion multiplication rotation laws hold: $$ij=k, ji=-k, jk=i, kj=-i, ki=j, ik=-j$$ The Hamilton product is defined as the standard one: $$(a_1+b_1i+c_1j+d_1k)\cdot(a_2+b_2i+c_2j+d_2k) = (a1a2-b1b2-c1c2-d1d2)+(a1b2+b1a2+c1d2-d1c2)i+(a1c2-b1d2+c1a2+d1b2)j+(a1d2+b1c2-c1b2+d1a2)k$$ To visualize how the points move along the Klein bottle, let us define a collision game. We put randomly $7000$ points in a Klein Bottle, visualized as seen in the gluing diagram. The yellow points are in the outer side and blue points in the inner side. The points are represented depending on the spin ( $k$ ) as little points, circles, stars and ""plus"" (+) symbols ( $k=0,1,2,3$ respectively). They are moving following random walks. Collision rules: When two points $P_1,P_2$ of located in the same side and with the same spin collide (they have exactly the same values $a,i,j,k$ ), they disappear and generate a new point $P_1+P_2$ (quaternion sum). When two points $P_1,P_2$ of the different side are in the same position and spin collide  (they have exactly the same values $i,j,k$ ), they disappear and generate a new point $P_1 \cdot P_2$ (quaternion Hamilton product). This is how it looks like when the width and height of the diagram is $100$ units and we put $7000$ points on the surface of the manifold: And this is the animation of the evolution of the first $500$ steps of a test: (*) I cannot add a bigger version of the animation due to the weight of the image, a bigger version can be seen here . The Python code is also available, please use it and modify it freely. Due to the properties of the Klein bottle: When a point goes out from the right side, is going to the other side of the Klein bottle, so it will appear from the left side of the diagram with the opposite side color and the $j$ position is inverted. When a point goes out from the left side, is going to the other side of the Klein bottle, so it will appear from the right side of the diagram with the opposite side color and the $j$ position is inverted. When a point goes out from the top or bottom, it keeps in the same current side (inner or outer), so it will appear at the opposite region of the current side (Top $\to$ Bottom, or Bottom $\to$ Top). As time evolves, collisions happen and the number of points decreases. I would like to ask the following questions: Are the properties of quaternions good for this kind of coordinate systems? Are there documented references of this kind of application? (quaternions applied as coordinate systems to topological manifolds). Any insights are very appreciated.","['coordinate-systems', 'reference-request', 'quaternions', 'visualization', 'general-topology']"
