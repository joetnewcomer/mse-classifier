1126008,Central Limit Theorem proof.,"I am trying to understand the proof of the Central Limit Theorem in my book. However, I don't really understand  what is going on. I know the proof is assuming that the moment generating functions of each $W_{i}$ exists.
Then we will show that eventually the limit of these generating functions approach $e^{t^2/2}$. Can someone please explain what is happening? This is almost in the middle of the proof. Given the following. $M(0) = 1, M^{(1)}(0) = 0, M^{(2)}(0) = 1 $ They apply Taylor's theorem, then to write $M(t)$ and get $M(t) = 1 + M^{(1)}(0)t +  \frac{t^2}{2} M^{2}(r) = 1 + \frac{t^2}{2} M^{2}(r) $. However, I don't understand why the proof stops after the second derivative in the Taylor expansion from the above expression. In addition, I the book does not explain what it's doing in the following algebraic expression . $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}$$[M(\frac{t}{\sqrt n})]^n$ = $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}$ [$1 + \frac{t^2}{2n} M^{2}(s)]^n$ = exp $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} n$ $\ln[$1$ + \frac{t^2}{2n} M^{2}(s)]^n$ = exp  $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{t^{2}}{2}M^{2}(s)$$\frac{ln[ 1 + \frac{t^2}{2n} M^{2}(s)] - ln(1)}{\frac{t^2}{2n} M^{2}(s)}$. and $|s| < \frac{|t|}{\sqrt n}$. I think they are taking natural log on both sides, and applying the the quotient rule. Can someone please help me understand the above.

1126121,Defining the equation of an ellipse in the complex plane,"Usually the equation for an ellipse in the complex plane is defined as $\lvert z-a\rvert + \lvert z-b\rvert = c$ where $c>\lvert a-b\rvert$. If we start with a real ellipse, can we define it in the manner below? For $x,y,h,k,a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $a,b\neq 0$, we define a real ellipse as
$$
  \frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.
$$
Let $z = \frac{x}{a} + i\frac{y}{b}$ and $z_0 = \frac{h}{a} + i\frac{k}{b}$. If we expand the equation for an ellipse, we have
$$
  \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2} -
  \frac{2xh}{a^2} - \frac{2yk}{b^2} = 1.
$$
Notice that $\lvert z\rvert^2 = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}$ and $\lvert z_0\rvert^2 = \frac{h^2}{a^2} + \frac{k^2}{b^2}$. Now, let's write the ellipse as
$$
  \lvert z\rvert^2 + \lvert z_0\rvert^2 - \frac{2xh}{a^2} - \frac{2yk}{b^2} +
  \frac{yh}{ab}i - \frac{yh}{ab}i + \frac{xk}{ab}i - \frac{xk}{ab}i =
  \lvert z\rvert^2 + \lvert z_0\rvert^2 - \bar{z}z_0 - z\bar{z}_0 = 1.
$$
Thus, the equation of an ellipse in the complex plane is
$$
  (z - z_0)(\bar{z} - \bar{z}_0) = \lvert z - z_0\rvert^2 = 1\Rightarrow
  \lvert z - z_0\rvert = 1
$$
where $z$ and $z_0$ are defined above.","['geometry', 'complex-numbers']"

1126231,What separates the dot product from the scalar projection?,"Just a little problem with geometric intuition here (or perhaps I just haven't slept in far too long!).

However, I thought that was the definition of the scalar projection? They are obviously not the same thing (however I can see that the scalar projection is derived from the geometric definition of the dot product); the scalar projection is the dot product divided by the magnitude of one of the vectors: $ \displaystyle \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = \| \vec{u} \| \| \vec{v} \| \cos{\theta}  $ $ \displaystyle \frac{\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}}{\| \vec{v} \|} = \| \vec{u} \|  \cos{\theta} = proj_{\vec{v}}\vec{u} $ What am I missing, in general, about the differences or similarities between these two things?","['geometry', 'intuition', 'vectors']"

After instituting an improvement / QA program for six months, let me assume that out of a sample of $55$ cases, there are only $11$ with residual flaws. The two samples are independent. Although the numbers are exaggerated, I still want to see if the two proportions are statistically different, and I think I have a couple of options: I can run an exact binomial test to calculate the probability that the new proportion of flawed observations, $11/55$, would occur if the actual underlying probability remained $31/52$. Alternatively, I can run a chi-square test. The chi-square is an approximation, and what I have read is that it is to be applied when the total number of observations is too high. This is clearly not the case in the example; however, playing with the numbers in R, I couldn't see any delay or problems with the results even after using numbers $> 10,000$. And there was no indication of any normal approximation being used. So, if this is all true, why shouldn't we always opt for an exact binomial test, rather than a chi square? The code in R would be: binom.test(c(11, 55 - 11), p = 31/52, alternative =""less"") versus: prop.test(c(31, 11), c(52, 55), correct = FALSE, alternative = 'greater') Thank you.","['statistics', 'statistical-inference']"

$$y(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty a_n(x-1)^2,$$

My question is, how do you do this process in reverse? Start with some arbitrary group (in the sense that its existence doesn't depend on anything) and learn something about it using field theory?","['galois-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
1127272,return a lower number based on a higher base number and vice versa.,"So I am making an attack timeout based on a speed rating for a program that I am writing, but I am no genius when it comes to math. As it is i have a formula like so speed(x) = x/50 the base speed rating defaults at 100, so the attack would occur every two seconds at speed(100) . Now what I want is for the attack to occur faster at a higher speed rating, and slower at a slower speed rating. I.e. speed(98) would return something higher than 2, while speed(101) would return something lower than 2. These numbers are just examples but the main point is that is there a formula that can return a lower number based on a higher base number, and vice versa? Example: speed(101) = forumla; returns x < y and speed(98) = formula; returns x > y y being a constant number such as 2.",['functions']

My method and working is: Case 1: Let $AX<\dfrac{l}{2}$. Then it is obvious that $AX<AO<BX$ and $BX=l-AX$. Then $AX,AO,BX$ will form a triangle iff $AX+AO>BX$ implying $AX+\dfrac{l}{2}>l-AX$ i.e. $AX>\dfrac{l}{4}$. The probability of this event is $P(AX>\dfrac{l}{4},AX<\dfrac{l}{2})=\dfrac{1}{4}$ Case 2: Let $AX>\dfrac{l}{2}$ then obviously $AX>AO>BX$ and we have $BX=l-AX$.

I've been studying differential geometry as part of a course on General Relativity, so I don't have a very well grounded understanding of the mathematical formalism; it's all kind of a blurry mess of index notations. The question are: 1) How do I formally interpret the product of two tensors/vectors? We often write products of the type $v^iw^j$ and just interpret them as a rank 2 tensor. Is this expression commutative? i.e. is it the same as  $w^jv^i$? I realize that this creature transforms like a rank 2 contra-variant tensor, but does it mean anything geometrically? Is there a meaningful notion of a product here? The same can be done for higher rank tensors, even products of mixed higher with lower rank tensors, etc. 2) Regarding the operation of lowering and raising indexes using the metric tensor. I realize that we define the co-variant vector $v_i$  as $g^{ij}v^j$. Can I write this as  $v^jg^{ij}$? This kind of relates to the previous question regarding commutation. Do I interpret the raising/lowering operation as a linear operator operating on a vector? If so the second notation seems wrong to me, but I've seen it used before... 3) We often encounter equations like the following one for a Christoffel symbol - $\Gamma_{\,\mu\nu}^{\rho}=g^{\rho\rho'}\Gamma_{\rho,\mu\nu}$. I have a problem interpreting this type of equation, as for it to make sense, I generally expect to see the same indexes on both sides. However on the right side $\rho$ is a summation index and doesn't actually appear there.

My original idea was to say $\psi (z)=\frac{(e^z-1)^2}{z^2}$ and then find the taylor series of $(e^z-1)^2$ at $z=0$, find the taylor series of $\frac{1}{z^2}$ at $z=0$ and multiply. The problem is that there is no such thing as taylor series of $\frac{1}{z^2}$ at $z=0$ since it is not analytic, continuous, or even defined at $z=0$. So that was a bad idea. My second idea ""worked"", but I want to check my answer. The idea was to find the taylor series of $f(z)=(e^z-1)^2$. It's easy to see that $f(0)=f'(0)=0$ so the first 2 terms are $0$, and for any $n \geq 2$: $f^{(n)}(z)=2e^z$ and so $f^{(n)}(0)=2$ So the taylor series of $f$ around $z=0$ is $f(z)=\frac{2}{2!}z^2+\frac{2}{3!}z^3+\frac{2}{4!}z^4+...$ So we have $\frac{2}{2!}z^2+\frac{2}{3!}+\frac{2}{4!}z^4+...=z^2 \psi(z)$, and so $\psi(z)=\frac{2}{2!}+\frac{2}{3!}z+\frac{2}{4!}z^2+...$ and we specified the first three terms.

1127845,"If six points of an elliptic curve are contained in a conic, then their sum is $O$.","Let $C$ be a projective cubic without singular points and $O\in C$ an inflexion point. We consider the addition in $C$ with $O$ as neutral element. If $R_{1},...,R_{6}\in C$ are different points such that there exists a conic that contains all of them, then $R_{1}+...+R_{6}=O$. I think I have to use Pappus/Pascal's theorem (depending on the irreducibility of the conic) and the next result: $a,b,c\in C$ lie on the same line if and only if $a+b+c=O$. The thing is that I do not know how to combine them to solve the exercise. Observation: This exercise is a particular case of theorem 9.2. of chapter 6 in Walker's algebraic curves book, but I would like to use more elementary tools.","['algebraic-geometry', 'elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-curves']"
1127849,Decorating eggs,"I came across this question as I have been helping someone decorate styrofoam eggs by gluing wrapping paper onto it. The question is quite simple but I found myself stumped. Given an egg what is the most efficient way to produce the prettiest egg? So prettiest here would mean with the least amount of creases when the wrapping paper has been glued onto the egg. After a bit of thought one realises that a crease occurs because the chart maps onto the egg are not isometries. We can produce a prettier egg by using more charts with smaller domain. However, we don't want to be here all day cutting out tiny shapes in wrapping paper and gluing them onto eggs so we only want to use 2 charts. So the question can be rephrased as Given an egg what 2 shapes should be cut out in the wrapping paper so that the charts are as close to an isometry as possible? The types of eggs I am thinking of are as follows: Glue two halves of two different ellipses together and then rotate about the axis of symmetry. So in parametric equations consider $x \colon [0, 2\pi) \to \mathbb{R}$ and $y \colon [0,2 \pi) \to \mathbb{R} $ where
$$x(\theta) = \begin{cases}
a \mathrm{cos} (\theta) \quad \text{for } \theta \in [0,\pi/2) \cup [3\pi/2,2\pi) \\
b\mathrm{cos}(\theta) \quad \text{for } \theta \in[\pi/2,3\pi/2)
\end{cases}$$
and
$$y(\theta) =\mathrm{sin}(\theta) $$
for $a,b \geq 1$. To get the egg rotate the image of $(x(\theta),y(\theta))$ about the x-axis.","['geometry', 'manifolds', 'soft-question']"

1127908,Boundary on a manifold,"I was wondering how I can see if a manifold has a boundary just by looking at the surface? The thing is that I want to understand how to apply the Gauß Bonnet theorem to surfaces and there I need to integrate over the boundary, too. If you are just dealing with sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ it is pretty simple to find out if a point is on the boundary, as soon as you have a visual picture of the set, cause you can just ask yourself if this point would be in the closure of the complement or if there is an open set containig this point which is still part of the set. This seems to be no longer possible for manifolds. Despite, it seems to be still possible to say that no point on the sphere for example is not in the interior which is different from the triangle in the plane, where the edges are visually not part of the interior. So somehow this boils down to: Think you are standing on a $n-$ dimensional manifold and you are standing at a point $p$. If you can walk in any of the $n-$ directions, this point is not part of the boundary, otherwise it is. Still, I don't like this characterization, because a cube for example does not have a boundary, although standing on any of the edges might give you the idea, that this should be part of a boundary. So my question is: Does anybody have a good way to find out if a point belongs to the boundary of a surface or not?","['differential-geometry', 'real-analysis', 'analysis', 'differential-topology', 'surfaces']"
1127921,For which prime numbers $p$ does the congruence $x^2 + x + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ have solutions?

1127935,Rank of a coherent sheaf in terms of coefficients of the Hilbert polynomial,"Let $X$ be a projective scheme over a field $k$. Let $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be an ample line bundle on $X$, then the Hilbert polynomial $P(E)$ is given by $m\mapsto\chi(E ⊗ O(m))$. The explicit polynomial form is given by the following result $\textbf{Lemma}$: Let $E$ be a coherent sheaf of dimension $d$ and let $H_1 , . . . , H_d \in |\mathcal{O}(1)|$ be an $E$-regular sequence. Then $P(E, m) = \chi(E ⊗ \mathcal{O}(m)) =\Sigma_{i=0}^{d}\chi(E|_{\cap_{j\leq i }H_j}){m+i-1\choose i}$. So this polynomial can be uniquely written in the form $\Sigma_{i=0}^d\alpha_i(E)\frac{m^i}{i!}$. We then define the rank as $rk(E)=\frac{\alpha_d(E)}{\alpha_d(\mathcal{O}_X)}$. But for an integral scheme, the rank is defined to be the rank at the generic point. How are these two notions the same? Similarly, the degree of $E$ is defined to be $deg(E)=\alpha_{d-1}(E)-rk(E).\alpha_{d-1}(\mathcal{O}_X)$. Again, for a projective variety, the degree is defined to be $c_1(E).H^{d-1}$. How do we show that these two are the same. Any help will be greatly appreciated!","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles']"
1127956,An inequality with elementary symmetric polynomials,"Fix a natural number $n\geq 1$ . Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be $n$ real numbers such that $a_i>0$ for each $i$ . Show that for each natural $k$ with $0\leq k\leq n$ $$e_k(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\geq\binom{n}{k}(a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n)^{k/n}$$ where $e_k(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ denotes the $k$ th symmetric polynomial with $n$ arguments and where we make the convention that $e_0(x_1,\ldots, x_n)=1$ . Here's the proof I gave: It suffices to prove the claim assuming that $a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n=1$ . For if this is not the case, then setting $\overline{a_i}=a_i/(a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n)^{1/n}$ will give $$\overline{a_1}\cdot\cdots\cdot\overline{a_n}=1$$ and the general claim will follow from the fact that $$e_k(\overline{a_1},\ldots,\overline{a_n})=\frac{1}{(a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n)^{k/n}} e_k(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$$ Thus we prove that if $a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n=1$ then $e_k(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\geq\binom{n}{k}$ . We induct on $n$ (we go through Pascal's Triangle row-by-row left-to-right). Note that this claim is trivial for $k=0$ or $k=n$ . Thus when $n=1$ , the claim holds for $k=0$ and $k=n$ . Now assume the claim is true for the natural number $m$ and all natural $k$ with $0\leq k\leq m$ ; we show that the claim is true for the natural number $m+1$ and all natural $k$ with $0\leq k\leq m+1$ . Since $$e_0(a_1,\ldots, a_{m+1})=1=\binom{m+1}{0}$$ the claim follows trivially. And since $$e_1(a_1,\ldots, a_{m+1})=a_1+\cdots+a_{m+1}\geq m+1$$ is a special case of the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality we have that this case holds as well. Without loss of generality we can assume that $a_1\leq \cdots\leq a_{m+1}$ . This ordering implies that $a_{m+1}\geq 1$ since a product of numbers strictly greater than 0 and strictly less than 1 cannot multiply to 1. Now note that $$e_{k+1}(a_1\ldots, a_{m+1})=e_{k+1}(a_1,\ldots,a_m)+a_{m+1}e_{k}(a_1,\ldots,a_m)$$ for $1\leq k+1\leq m$ . Thus $$e_{k+1}(a_1,\ldots, a_{m+1})\geq\binom{m}{k+1}+a_{m+1}\binom{m}{k}\geq\binom{m}{k+1}+\binom{m}{k}=\binom{m+1}{k+1}$$ And since $e_{m+1}(a_1,\ldots,a_{m+1})=a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_{m+1}=1=\binom{m+1}{m+1}$ , the claim follows by induction. Two questions. First, is this proof correct? Second, can someone come up with a slicker proof? Moving through Pascal's Triangle is kind of messy. Perhaps someone knows certain recursive relations between the symmetric polynomials that would make this easier, or other interesting inequalities (I suspect some identity with binomial coefficients will have to be used in another proof).","['symmetric-polynomials', 'inequality', 'abstract-algebra', 'proof-verification', 'alternative-proof']"
