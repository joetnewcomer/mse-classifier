2996773,"Solving linear system, finding equilibrium and bifurcation points","For homework, I have to solve the following problem: consider the system of ODE's \begin{equation} 
x'=-x^2+a \\ y'=-y
\end{equation} where the parameter $a$ is a real number. I have to characterize the equilibrium points and draw a bifurcation diagram. I am asked to linearize the system first. I have missed a couple of classes and I am struggling to understand how I am supposed to work here. If $a$ is positive, then there are two equilibrium points $(\sqrt{a},0)$ and $(-\sqrt{a},0)$ , if $a$ is equal to zero, then there is one equilibrium point $ \left ( 0,0 \right )$ and finally  if $a$ is negative,  then no equilibrium points exist. The Jacobi matrix of the system is \begin{pmatrix}
 - 2x & 0\\ 
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} which is diagonal, hence its eigenvalues are $-2x$ and $-1$ . Then, I calculate this matrix at the equilibrium points: If $a>0$ , then the two Jacobi matrices are \begin{pmatrix}
-2\sqrt{a}  & 0\\ 
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} which has two real and negative eigenvalues, so $(\sqrt{a},0)$ is a stable point and \begin{pmatrix}
2\sqrt{a}  & 0\\ 
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} which has one negative and one positive eigenvalue, so $(-\sqrt{a},0)$ is a saddle point. If $a=0$ the Jacobi matrix is \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0\\ 
0 & -1
\end{pmatrix} which has one zero eigenvalue so the linearization method does not provide any information about the stability of $\left ( 0,0 \right )$ . As my notes suggest, for this point we find the eigenvectors of this matrix and the orbits of the solutions. But I do not understand why and what information we obtain from this. What can I say about the stability of $\left ( 0,0 \right )$ then? What about the saddle point, do I use a similar method? I understand that there is a bifurcation for $a=0$ but I don't know how am I supposed to draw the diagram without a computer. Another thing I find in the notes in another example is that we divide the equations and find a relationship between the solutions which does not involve time, for some reason.

2996796,"""Funny Integral"" over the Cantor Set","I was thinking about integrals and how one might generalize them to be able to integrate over fractals rather than just over intervals. For example, consider the cantor set $C$ . Let us assume that $$\int_C dx=1$$ for our funny, not-yet-well-defined integral-like operation. If we assume linearity of this ""funny integral,"" then we may calculate the integral of $xdx$ over the Cantor set, because of its symmetry about $x=1/2$ : $$\int_C xdx=\int_C (1-x)dx=1-\int_C xdx=\frac{1}{2}$$ We may also make use of the fact that the left half of the Cantor set, or $C_1$ , is a contraction of $C$ by a factor of $3$ , and the right half $C_2$ is also a contraction of $C$ by a factor of $3$ . If $f$ is a function defined over the Cantor set, by extending another property of integrals to our ""funny integral,"" we have that $$\int_C f(x)dx=\int_{C_1}f(x)dx+\int_{C_2}f(x)dx$$ However, if we wish to make the substitution $x\to x/3$ , we should not replace $dx$ with $dx/3$ , because shrinking $C$ by a factor of $3$ does not actually decrease its ""size"" by a factor of $3$ , but rather by a factor of $2$ (this is also why the fractal dimension of $C$ is $\log_3(2)$ ). Thus, when we let $x\to x/3$ , we must also let $dx\to dx/2$ , giving us $$\int_C f(x)dx=\int_{C}\frac{f(x/3)+f(1-x/3)}{2}dx$$ This formula, derived by assuming some of the familiar properties of the classical integral for our ""funny integral,"" allows one to compute the integrals of $x^2,x^3,x^4,$ and so on recursively. My question is the following: Is there a ""proper"" way (a way already accepted and used by mathematicians, I mean) to integrate over a nasty fractal set like $C$ , and if so, do my assumptions about the ""funny integral"" still hold? I would be very surprised if this sort of thing has not been formalized yet.","['integration', 'cantor-set', 'fractal-analysis', 'definite-integrals', 'fractals']"

2997086,Orthogonality of principal curvature directions,"I was trying to find a counterexample to the theorem that states that principal curvature directions are orthogonal.
Obviously such an example doesn't exist but I'm having hard time understanding what's wrong with the following example. I construct the surface as follows.
I take a planar curve, namely a parabola $a (r^2)$ and revolve it through the $Z$ axis while adjusting the parameter $a$ that controls the curvature of the parabola. The parametrization is given by: $$ \left [X = rcos(\theta), \quad \quad Y = rsin(\theta),  \quad \quad Z = ar^2 \right],$$ $$a(\theta)=0.5(1 + sin(4\theta)),$$ where the parametric domain is $$ \theta \in [0,\pi],  \quad \quad r \in [-0.5,0.5].$$ The ""problematic"" point is the origin $(0,0,0)$ .
See a Matlab rendering of the surface in $3D$ : For $\theta \in \{3\pi/8,7\pi/8\}$ the $\sin(4\theta)$ in the expression for $a(\theta)$ is at minimum ( $-1$ ) and we get $a=0$ .
The restriction of $\theta$ to these two values corresponds to two orthogonal 
straight lines on the surface (green in the figure).
Hence $\kappa_2 = 0$ .
For $\theta \in \{\pi/8,5\pi/8\}$ the $\sin(4\theta)$ in the expression for $a(\theta)$ is at maximum ( $1$ ) and we get $a=1$ .
The restriction of $\theta$ to these two values corresponds to two orthogonal parabolas on the surface (red in the figure) with $\kappa_1=2$ . Here is a top view of the $XY$ plane: The ""contradiction"" seems to be that the curves with minimal and maximal curvatures at the origin are attained at $45$ degrees rather than $90$ .",['differential-geometry']

2997376,When does order matter in probability,"In most cases, I can intuitively understand when selection order is important in probabilistic inference. However, I've come across a few cases recently where I've come unstuck. Here's an example, Alice has 2 kids and one of them is a girl. What is the probability that the other child is also a girl? You can assume that there is an equal number of males and females in the world. The answer I am given is as follows, The outcomes for two kids can be {BB, BG, GB, GG} Since it is mentioned that one of them is a girl, we can remove the BB option from the sample space. Therefore the sample space has 3 options while only one fits the second condition. Therefore the probability the second child will be a girl too is 1/3. So if the answer is correct the order of selection matters, because both BG and GB appear as possible outcomes above. On the other hand, the way I tried to answer the question was to note that we are already given that Alice has 2 kids and one of them is a girl. My logic goes that we then have only two possibilities to choose from for the 2nd child G or B, which would lead me to answer 1/2. If the question would have been, e.g. Alice wants to have two kids what is the probability that she will have a G and B. Then in my mind order would matter {BB, BG, GB, GG} but not in the above. Can someone explain to me if/why I am wrong? and in any case, I'm interested to hear your general tips for establishing whether order matters in these types of questions.","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'probability']"

The correct answer is $\frac{(1-e^{-2})\pi}{4}$ , but I keep getting $(1-e^{-2})\pi$ , so I want to see where I have made a mistake. Here is the method: setting $t = 1$ provides the integral in question. By repeatedly differentiating $I(t)$ , you  can obtain the differential equation that $4  I'(t) = I'''(t)$ . Setting $J(t) = I'(t)$ , use a Laplace transform to obtain $J(t)$ . Now integrate $\int_0^1 J(t)dt$ ,  which is equal to $I(1) - I(0)$ from the second fundamental theorem of calculus. Since $I(0) = 0$ , solving for $I(1)$ yields the integral in question. Keep in mind that I'm still in high school, so all I really know how to do is partial derivatives and Laplace transforms to solve differential equations. If something is beyond the subjects of multivariable calculus, please continue to answer the question, but know that what I am looking for is an answer through the Feynman technique and Laplace transforms.","['definite-integrals', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'laplace-transform', 'multivariable-calculus', 'calculus']"

2997828,How big must the union of a group's Sylow p-subgroups be?,"For various orders $n$ it's a common exercise to prove that a finite group $G$ of order $n$ can't be simple by using the Sylow theorems to show that there is some prime $p \mid n$ such that the number $n_p$ of Sylow $p$ -subgroups equals $1$ , so the unique Sylow $p$ -subgroup is normal. One way these proofs can go is that you show that if $n_p$ isn't equal to $1$ , then because $n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p$ it must be very large, so large that there isn't enough room in $G$ for all of its Sylow $p$ -subgroups together plus the other Sylow subgroups. I know how to run this argument if the exponent $a$ of $p$ in $n$ is $1$ and we can show that $n_p = \frac{n}{p}$ ; in this case the Sylow $p$ -subgroups are cyclic, so intersect only in the identity, which means that $G$ has at least $\frac{n}{p}(p - 1)$ elements of order $p$ , and hence only room for $\frac{n}{p}$ elements of other orders. However, I don't know how to run this argument if $a \ge 2$ ; this came up when I was trying to answer this question and specifically trying to show that a group of order $|G| = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2 = 735$ can't be simple. The Sylow theorems give that if $n_7 \neq 1$ then $n_7 = 15$ , so $G$ has the maximum possible number of Sylow $7$ -subgroups. The specific question this gave rise to is: Specific question: What is the sharpest lower bound on the size of the union of these $15$ Sylow $7$ -subgroups? I wanted to use the Bonferroni inequalities to address this question, using the fact that any two Sylow $7$ -subgroups intersect in at most $7$ elements, but something very funny happened: if I apply Bonferroni to all $15$ subgroups I get a lower bound of $$15 \cdot 49 - {15 \choose 2} \cdot 7 = 0.$$ The problem is that there are too many pairwise intersections between $15$ subgroups. If I instead apply Bonferroni with only $k$ of the $15$ subgroups I get a lower bound of $$49k - 7 {k \choose 2}$$ which turns out to be maximized when $k = 8$ , giving a lower bound of $210$ . Is it possible to do better than this? I'm ignoring $7$ of the Sylows! So the general question is: General question: What is the sharpest lower bound on the size of the union of the Sylow $p$ -subgroups of a finite group $G$ which can be written as a function of the size $p^a$ of such a subgroup and the number $n_p$ of such subgroups? What if $G$ is assumed to be simple? When $a = 1$ the union has size exactly $(p - 1) n_p + 1$ . In general any two Sylows intersect in at most $p^{a-1}$ elements, so Bonferroni with $k$ of the Sylows gives a lower bound of $$k p^a - {k \choose 2} p^{a-1} = k p^{a-1} \left( p - \frac{k-1}{2} \right)$$ which is maximized when $k \approx p$ as above (or $k = n_p$ , if $p$ is more than a little larger than $n_p$ ). But the smaller $p$ is compared to $n_p$ the less helpful of a bound this will be.","['group-theory', 'sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'inequality']"

He saw the following conclusion in this note Page 188, in the proof of 4.4.6. Given a riemannian manifold $M$ , and a point $p\in M$ . Let $$r=\sup\{d: \exp_p|_{B(0,d)}\textrm{is diffeomorphism}\}$$ Then $$\exp\{x\in T_p: x\in B(0,r)\}=\{x\in M: d(x,p)<r\}$$ where $d(*,*)$ is the induced metric on riemannian manifold. The note thinks it is trivial. As one can see, the $\subseteq$ part is trivial. But the problem arise in $\supseteq $ part. The $\exp$ is surjection to the right side implies any point with distance less than $r$ to $x$ is connected by a geodesic. It is generally a boundry problem in ODE. One knows that the geodesics are length-minimizing locally, and since $\textrm{d}\exp=\operatorname{id}$ , geodesics connect each point locally, but it is often mysterious to talk about how much locally. I think the claim is false. 
 - I considered firstly the sphere with hole, then two point whose big circle joint the hole can not be joint by geodesics. But the problem is the $r$ defined above is exactly the distance between $p$ and the hole. 
So the example is not a counter-exmaple. Another example is a plane with deep well. One can construct a deep well (of course smoothly) at $1$ , and the hole is so deep that the geodesic connected $0$ and $2$ is longer than the path pass around the well. But the problem is the geodesic going into the well may intersects with the others after leaving the well, so the $r$ may be short also. So the question is Is the above statement right? And what can we say about the relation between the induced metric and the geodesics.

Aside from this, it would be necessary to develop plane geometry as precisely as we intend to develop the properties of real numbers ... We shall use geometric pictures only as an aid to intuition"" Later in the text, he derives the equation of a circle from it's definition. The definition is: ""A circle with center (a, b) and radius r > 0 contains all the points (x, y) whose distance from (a, b) is equal to r."" Now, here's the part I'm confused about:
Deriving the equation of the circle depended on the definition of the circle, and the definition of distance between two points on the Cartesian plane. How do we prove that plotting all the points which satisy the equation of a circle will actually be a circle on the Cartesian plane. For example - if the definition of distance were changed, the 'circle' might look completely different on the plane. Or if the plane were 'bent' a circle would also look different. I assume that the definition of a circle does not change in these cases - it's just that the circle 'looks' different from what we expect. So how do we proceed that the circle still looks like a circle on the Cartesian Plane? In fact, for any equation, how do we prove that the graph is correct? For example, for a parabola, we could plot a large number of points, and then demonstrate that it forms a pattern that looks like a parabola- but the unplotted points could still break this pattern. I don't know if this confusion seems to stem from what Spivak mentioned earlier in the text- linking the algebraic and geometric concepts, or if I'm just over thinking things. Any help would be appreciated, and if there is a book or resource that explains this in more detail please let me know.","['calculus', 'geometry']"

  mapping subsets of $\Omega$ onto $[0,1]$ . Is it a different $P'$ probability measure altogether? I mean surely it depends on the map of
  our previous probability measure $P$ ? What is the intuition behind
  this rather opaque version of defining the probability with respect to
  a random variable? My example for independence: Let there be $3$ $6-$ sided dice with each dice taking on either colour blue, green or red.

Since T(n) = 1 for all values $\le$ 10 and $\ge$ 1, we know T(n) =1 for all base cases. 1 < 10n when n $\ge$ 1, therefore P(n) is true. Inductive hypothesis.

Here what is being minimized by the curve is the $1$ -dim measure of the $1$ -dim object in the $2$ -dim space that joins the two given $0$ -dim objects. In $3$ -dim Euclidean space, what is the minimal surface that connects (and necessarily contains) two given straight line segments (of known finite length)? Again, here what is being minimized is the surface area ( $2$ -dim measure) of the $2$ -dim object (embedded in $3$ -dim space) connecting two given $1$ -dim objects. Is there an umbrella name for this whole category? By ""the whole category"" I mean given line segments can be in general configurations and not just special cases like being parallel, or the two segments having the same length. (btw the special case of parallel and same length seems to yield helicoid as the minimal surface) As pointed out by Rahul in the comment, besides the given two straight line segments, it is necessary that one specifies the ""other"" boundaries. For simplicity, a reasonable choice seems to be connecting the end points to have a non-planar (skew) quadrilateral frame (for the soap film, so to speak). Note: This post seems relevant, but it doesn't solve my problem (of finding the keywords). I suspect this should be one of the basic stuff in differential geometry that everybody knows or agrees on (just like how people agree on the notion of a straight line). The next section describes my current guesswork, and it would be nice to know if I'm on the right track. My Naive Guess: the unique ruled surface Given two straight line segments in the $3$ -dim space, it suffice to consider the two skew lines $L_1$ and $L_2$ that contain them respectively. As one can parametrize a segment as part of an infinite line, the desired minimal surface from the given segments is part of the surface ""generated"" by $L_1$ and $L_2$ . One can find the unique pair of points, $P_1$ on $L_1$ and $P_2$ on $L_2$ , that have the smallest distance. Accordingly one obtains $\overset{\longrightarrow}{P_1P_2}$ as the common normal vector between for two skew lines. Now one can define a ruled surface by parametrizing the ""moving"" lines $L(t)$ , thus making a ruled surface, with parameter $t$ : starting with $L(t) = L_1$ at $t = 0$ , ""move"" $L(t)$ towards $L_2$ along $\overset{\longrightarrow}{P_1P_2}$ , ""anchoring"" at $P_1$ and rotate $L(t)$ along the way to make it eventually coincide with $L_2$ . The surface is not yet unique before specifying the amount of rotation (with respect to the distance to $L_2$ ). I'm guessing the rotation should be done linearly, but I haven't figure out if this indeed minimizes the surface area. Obviously a standard approach is to formulate the whole thing in terms of calculus of variations. I've done the almost trivial case of a straight line minimizing the distance, but apparently things get very complicated already for a $2$ -dim surface in $3$ -dim. Even in the special cases where the coordinates are setup nicely so that the surface is a function like $z = f(x,y)$ , it's an elliptic PDE and the solution seems to vary greatly depending on the boundary conditions. In short, I don't know how to handle the situation.","['euclidean-geometry', 'analytic-geometry', 'calculus-of-variations', 'parametric', 'differential-geometry']"

Note: I took the weight function, $w$ , to be $1$ . Please help.","['proof-verification', 'fourier-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"
2999390,How many ultrafilters there are in an infinite space?,"I'm stuck with the next exercise from the book Rings of Continuous Functions by Gillman. If $X$ is infinite, there exist $2^{2^{|X|}}$ ultrafilters on $X$ all of whose members are of cardinal $X$ . The exercise have a hint based on the next proof (here $\beta X$ is the Stone–Čech compactification) In the proof, the author constructs $2^{2^{X}}$ distinct ultrafilters on $X$ . The hint of the exercise says In the proof of Theorem 9.2, observe that every finite intersection of members of $\mathfrak{B}_{\mathscr{S}}$ is of cardinal $|X|$ . Adjoin to each family $\mathfrak{B}_{\mathscr{S}}$ all subsets of $\mathscr{F}\times\Phi$ with complement of power less than $|X|$ . I'm stuck in the two parts of the hint. I don't know how can I prove that every finite intersection of elements of $\mathfrak{B}_{\mathscr{S}}$ is of cardinal $|X|$ . I only know that because $\mathfrak{b}_{S_{i}}\subseteq \mathscr{F}\times \Phi$ and $-\mathfrak{b}_{S_{j}}\subseteq \mathscr{F}\times \Phi$ then $|\mathfrak{b}_{S_{i}}|\leq|X|$ and then $|-\mathfrak{b}_{S_{j}}|\leq |X|$ . Therefore $$|\mathfrak{b}_{S_1}\cap\mathfrak{b}_{S_2}\cap\dots\cap,\mathfrak{b}_{S_k}\cap-\mathfrak{b}_{S_{k+1}}\cap\dots\cap-\mathfrak{b}_{S_n}|\leq|\mathfrak{b}_{S_1}|\leq|X|$$ But, how can I conclude the another inequality?, i.e., $$|\mathfrak{b}_{S_1}\cap\mathfrak{b}_{S_2}\cap\dots\cap,\mathfrak{b}_{S_k}\cap-\mathfrak{b}_{S_{k+1}}\cap\dots\cap-\mathfrak{b}_{S_n}|\geq|X|$$ And, how can it helps to consider the subsets of $\mathscr{F}\times\Phi$ with complement of power less than $|X|$ ?

2999453,"Suppose $\kappa$ is a cardinal, such that $2 \kappa = \kappa$. Can it be proven that $\kappa ! = 2^\kappa$ without choice?","The original question is given in an exercise. The first part of the problem is to show that if $\left|A\right| = \left|A\right| +\left|A\right|$ for some set $A$ , then there exists a partition of $A$ , with every cell in the partition having cardinality $2$ (i.e. a partition of $A$ into pairs). The second part of the problem is to show that the cardinality of the set of permutations of $A$ is $2^{\left|A\right|}$ . Using the first part of the problem, it's not hard to show that that cardinality of set of permutations of $A$ is bounded between $2^{\left|A\right|}$ and $\left|A\right|^{\left|A\right|}$ . But I couldn't find a way to proceed from here without assuming that $\left|A\right| = \left|A\right|\cdot\left|A\right|$ . Is it possible to complete the proof without choice?","['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"
2999482,Zero-dimensional Hilbert scheme of two points and Hilbert-Chow morphism,"I would like to understand what happens to the Hilbert scheme of two points on a scheme if the scheme is zero-dimensional. The background for this question is just general curiosity, Hilbert schemes were discussed a lecture I attended but no-one every talked about this case (only about curves and surfaces). The following should, hopefully, serve as minimal example. If there are issues with it, let me know. Let $X$ be the subscheme of $\mathbb A^1$ defined by the ideal $\langle x^k\rangle$ for some $k$ . We can consider the symmetric product $\operatorname{Sym}^2(X)$ and it is easy to write down equations for this by computing the ring of invariants. I did so and got a point of multiplicity $\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ in $\operatorname{Sym}^2(X)$ . Question 1: Is there, besides the calculations, a reason to expect this number? From my lecture I know that for a scheme $Y$ we have the Hilbert-Chow morphism $$H:\operatorname{Hilb}^2(Y)\to \operatorname{Sym}^2(Y),\quad C\mapsto \sum\limits_{P\in Y}\operatorname{length}_P(C)\cdot P, $$ and I have at least a rough idea of what it does. In particular, I understand that points being mapped to points of the form $2P\in\operatorname{Sym}^2(Y)$ can be understood as points together with a tangent direction. Returning to the zero-dimensional situation, $\operatorname{Hilb}^2(X)$ should be zero-dimensional, too. But then, how can we talk a tangent direction at a point? Question 2: Do we have a Hilbert-Chow morphism for zero-dimensional $X$ and if so, how can we understand it? Finally, I am also curious about the multiplicity of $\operatorname{Hilb}^2(X)$ . Is there a way to calculate it, just as I did for $\operatorname{Sym}^2(X)$ ? Question 3: What is the multiplicity of $\operatorname{Hilb}^2(X)$ ? Comments, references and basically everything is welcome. In particular, partial answers would also be helpful. Thanks in advance.","['affine-schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'schemes']"
2999528,Optimal rate of growth of i.i.d. Gaussians?,"Suppose I have a countable collection $\{N_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ of independent $\mathcal{N}(0.1)$ random variables and I want to estimate their rate of growth in the sense that I want to find a function $f:\mathcal{N}\to\mathcal{R}$ such that $$\sup_k \frac{\vert N_k\vert}{f(k)} <\infty \ \text{ a.s.}$$ By means of the basic inequality $$\mathbb{P} (\vert N_k\vert \geq c)\leq 2e^{-c^2/2}$$ and Borel-Cantelli lemma, I can obtain that this works for $f(k)=\sqrt{2\log(1+k)}$ (the constant 2 is there only because it simplifies calculations) and that such an $f$ is sufficiently optimal in the sense that $\alpha=1/2$ is the threshold parameter for which this works with $f$ of the form $(\log(1+k))^\alpha$ . The problem is that, if I define the variable $$Y:= \sup_k \frac{\vert N_k\vert}{\sqrt{2\log(1+k)}}$$ then apparently $Y$ is heavy tailed distributed, in the sense that the estimate I'm able to obtain again by the above inequality is $$\mathbb{P}(Y\geq y)\leq \frac{C}{1+y^2}$$ for a suitable constant $C$ . So the first thing I'm asking is whether this estimate is quite sharp, and $Y$ is indeed heavy-tailed, or there are better estimates which lead to $Y$ having some finite moments. The second question is, if this is not the case, if one defines instead $$Y:= \sup_k \frac{\vert N_k\vert}{g(k)\sqrt{2\log(1+k)}}$$ for a suitable $g$ such that $g(k)\to\infty$ as $k\to\infty$ , if there is some kind of optimal $g$ that grows as slowly as possible but such that $Y$ now admits moments of all orders. My intuition tells me that this should work for instance with $g(k)=\sqrt{\log(\log(1+k))}$ but I'm not able to perform nice calculations and I don't know if there is something even better, like $g$ even slower such that $Y$ still admits all moments.","['probability-distributions', 'probability-theory']"

2999689,How to prove that an even permutation of $A_n$ is a square of another permutation from $S_n$?,"I am trying to go through a proof which contains a statement that an even permutation from $A_n$ is a square of another permutation from $S_n$ . My basic ideas are like this: Suppose an even permutation is $y$ . As the signature of an even permutation is $+1$ , we are able to write it as a product of $t_{1}t_{2}t_{3}t_{4}...t_{2r-1}t_{2r}$ with each $t$ standing for a two cycle. Then, consider $t_{1}t_{2}$ , it can be written as $(ij)(kl)$ if $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ are distinct, or as $(ij)(jk)$ if they are not distinct. However, $(ij)(kl) = (ikjl)^2$ and $(ij)(jk) = (ikj)^2$ , which means each of the $t_1t_2$ , $t_3t_4$ ,..., $t_{2r-1}t_{2r}$ is a square of another permutation of $S_n$ , say $x_i$ . However, how does it imply that $y$ is a square of another permutation? If $y = x_1^2...x_r^2$ , does it necessarily mean that $y$ is a square of something? Is $x_i$ commutative in this case?
