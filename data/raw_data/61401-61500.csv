692049,Example of nonempty scheme with no closed points,"I know that when a scheme $X$ is quasicompact, every point has a closed point in it's closure.

Say $q$ has degree three and $p$ has degree two. If you partially decompose it, you'll get three variables $A$,$B$,$C$ and three equations with these variables. You can solve these variables and find the values of the numerators. But not all systems of three equations have solutions, so how do we know that $A$, $B$ and $C$ always exists for all rational functions that meet the criteria for decomposition?","['fractions', 'algebra-precalculus', 'partial-fractions']"
692108,If the partial derivatives are continuous then the tangent plane exists.,"Background: I am studying Calculus from Stewart which is not rigorous. So, Stewart does not talk about this problem. Also, multivariable calculus is dealt mostly in context of three dimensions which is alright for me. And, I would like the answer in the context of 3 dimensions. Definitions: Differentiable: A function is differentiable at a point iff the tangents with respect to every direction (a,b) lies on one plane. This definition is just an intuition. I may be wrong and it may not be equivalent to the standard definition. But the problem still stands even if the two definitions are not equivalent. Motivation: Problem: If the partial derivatives are continuous at a point, then the function is differentiable at the point. This problem that if the partial derivatives are continuous at a point, then all the tangents lie on a single plane has been bugging me for a while. Sidenote: I saw in one forum post that existence of both partial derivatives at the point, and continuity of one is enough for the above problem to be true. Trials and thoughts: I don't seem to have a mental picture of of how this theorem is true and how the argument works. I have thought about proving the inverse: If all the tangents lie on a plane, then one of the partial derivatives might not be continuous. But, I haven;t succeeded.
All I have done is set up the problem using the respective definitions. First I found the equation of the plane which contains the the two partial tangents and the point. Then I found the slope of the line which lies on the plane and is directed in a particular direction (a,b). Then, I tried to show that this ratio is equal to the directional derivative in the direction (a,b). The proof of this will illuminate why this theorem works the way it works. Thanks for the answers.","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"

692223,Topology - interval homeomorphic to another interval,"{a.}
Prove that any open interval $(a, b)$ is homeomorphic to the interval $(0, 1)$. Define $f:(a, b) \to (0, 1)$ by $f(x)=(x-a)/(b-a)$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:(0, 1) \to (a, b) := f^{-1}=a(-x)+a+bx$. We can see that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous functions. Therefore, the open intervals are homeomorphic. {b.}
Prove that the ray $(a, \infty)$ is homeomorphic to $(1, \infty)$. Define $f:(a, \infty) \to (1, \infty)$ by $f(x)=x/a$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:(1, \infty) \to (a, \infty) := f^{-1}=ax$. We can see that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous functions. Therefore, the defined rays are homeomorphic. {c.}
Prove that $(a, \infty)$ is homeomorphic to $(-\infty, -a)$. Define $f:(a, \infty) \to (-\infty, -a)$ by $f(x)=-x$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:(-\infty, -a) \to (a, \infty) := f^{-1}=x$. We can see that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous functions. Therefore, these open intervals are homeomorphic. {d.}
Prove that R is homeomorphic to the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$. Define $f:R \to (-\pi/2, \pi/2)$ by $f(x)=tan^{-1}x$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:(-\pi/2, \pi/2) \to R := f^{-1}=tanx$. We can see that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous functions. Therefore, R is homeomorphic to the interval $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$. {e.}
Prove that $(1, \infty)$ is homeomorphic to $(0, 1)$. Define $f:(1, \infty) \to (0, 1)$ by $f(x)=1/x$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:(0, 1) \to (1, \infty) := f^{-1}=1/x$. We can see that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous functions. Therefore, these open intervals of the real line are homeomorphic. We thus conclude that any two open intervals of the real line are homeomorphic. {f.}
Prove that any two closed intervals of the real line are homeomorphic.
Define $f:[a, b] \to [c, d]$ by $f(x)=[(d-c)(x-a)/(b-a)]+c$, which is one-to-one and onto. Consider $f^{-1}:[c, d] \to [a, b] := f^{-1}=[(b-a)(x-a)/(d-c)]+a$.

692230,Help me correct my ideas of continuity,"I've been studying real analysis over the past few months, and I'm having trouble organizing the different notions of continuity and ideas related to continuity in my head geometrically. I will explain my notions in general terms (in other words, without delta-epsilon definitions). Can you tell me how to sharpen my intuitive thinking wherever my ideas are incorrect or too general? Continuous - The preimage of every open set is an open set. Lipshitz Continuous - The absolute values of the slopes of all secant lines for the function are bounded. Uniformly Continuous - The best notion I have is that it's just what a continuous function over a closed and bounded set is. One idea I have is that it means the function is the uniform limit of some series of piecewise linear functions, but does this hold for uniformly continuous functions over domains that are not compact? Absolutely Continuous - This is my shakiest notion geometrically. The delta-epsilon definition gives me a loose notion of being able to break up the condition for uniform continuity over disconnected unions of open intervals. I know absolutely continuous functions have to be of bounded variation, which carries a geometrical notion of a continuous function whose image over any partition of the domain has a finite arc length, but I can't see what makes this notion stronger visually, nor can I grasp how it connects so well to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Another question: how do these different types relate to one another, and what examples can show these relations? I know the Cantor function is a good example of a uniformly continuous function (one of bounded variation) that is not absolutely continuous, but is it Lipschitz? If not, is there a function that is Lipschitz but not absolutely continuous?

$|a - L| > e$. 2. How? We chose $e$ guarantee this? However, by Darboux’s Theorem , there exists a point x such that $|x| < d$

Now the way I approached the problem was to take the derivative of the CDF with respect to $\lambda$ to get the PDF which is: $$(x-L)e^{-\lambda(x-L)}$$ Then since we have $n$ observations where $n=10$, we have the following joint pdf, due to independence: $$(x_i-L)^ne^{-\lambda(x_i-L)n}$$
which can be rewritten as the following log likelihood: $$n\ln(x_i-L)-\lambda\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-L)$$
Is this the correct approach? Because it would take quite a while and be pretty cumbersome to evaluate $n\ln(x_i-L)$ for every observation? Part2: The question also asks for the ML Estimate of $L$.
So assuming the log likelihood is correct, we can take the derivative with respect to $L$ and get: $\frac{n}{x_i-L}+\lambda=0$ and solve for $L$? Is this correct?

693231,How to compute the mean average exponent of the naturals? What is the limit for large numbers?,"With a friend I was trying to get an understanding for why the expected gap between primes is logarithmic. With that motivation I tried to express the average exponent of numbers. By average exponent of a number I mean the following rational: If $p,q,r$ are some primes and a number $n$ has factorization $n=p^aq^br^c$, then in this case the average exponent would be $(a+b+c)/3$. For example the number $3087$ equals $3^2\,7^3$, a number where all exponents are bigger than one, and the average exponent is $(2+3)/2=2.5$. Similarly, the average exponent of $156=2^2\,3^113^1$ is $(2+1+1)/3=1.\dot 3$. We computed the average exponent for the first $10000$ numbers and, not too surprisingly, the value jumps quite a bit and the function isn't nice to look at. So next we plot a function of $n$ with value being the mean from the numbers $2$ up to $n$  (of the average exponents). The plot is below, it seems to stabilize to $\approx 4/3$ in this interval. How to interpret this? What is the behavior and more concretely the limit of the above construction?

693366,"Number of binary $M\times N$ matrices with even row sums, even col sums and $K$ ones, $K$ even","A combinatorial problem arising with certain checksums: When sending messages, the user data are protected by adding a parity bit for bit positions $1\dots8$ and a parity bit for each byte. So, the checksum protected messages have both even parity bitwise (columns) and even parity bytewise (rows). Now, bit failures will not be detected on the receiver side, if they occur on an even number of positions in rows and on an even number of positions in columns. I have to figure out the undetected error probability of this checksum for certain user message lengths ($1$ byte up to $15$ bytes). As a consequence, assuming equally distributed bit failure probability, I have to find out for each even number $K$ of bit failures, a (closed) formula for: How many $M\times N$ binary matrices are there having even row sums and even column sums, whereby the number of $1s$ is $K$, $K$ even? It's relatively easy to answer this question, if there is no restriction to a specific value of $K$. This is stated e.g. as exercise $20$ in Richard P. Stanleys ""Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol I, 2nd Edition"" (see also the answer to question 329932 ). I tried to solve this problem with generating functions.

For 6 weeks the students learned about basic/classical algebraic geometry. In a few weeks they will start projects based on material from the course which they have to present. The idea is that the question they have to answer is difficult enough to be worth presenting, but not too difficult as to go beyond the scope of what was taught.
Does anyone have algebraic geometry problems which would be good topics for projects? I should mention what they have already learned in my lessons. We went through definitions and examples of affine and projective varieties (of course no mention of structure sheaves), regular and rational maps, projective space and it's standard affine covering, Bezout's theorem without proof, five points determine a conic, Segre and Veronese maps, singular and smooth points, blowing-up a point and basic resolution of singularities (for curves and some simple surfaces). I tried to stay clear of abstract/commutative algebra techniques since their knowledge in this area is limited. One possible project I am thinking about is asking the student to explore/classify various types of singularities for curves and surfaces (cuspidal, nodal, pinch point etc) and learning some of the techniques for finding such singularities. The five points determine a conic would have made a good portion of one project if I didn't already cover it in class. Any ideas from past experience would be a big help. UPDATE: The three project choices ended up being the following: An elementary proof that 27 lines lie on a smooth cubic surface, a basic exploration of resolution of singularities, and a proof of the Cayley-Bacharach Theorem. The students already presented a few weeks ago, and I was very pleased with the results. The material was definitely above what they were used to, but they learned a lot. I thought it would be nice for future lecturers on the subject to know that high school students can learn the basics of the field.","['algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question']"

Then the path components of $X$ under the usual topology of $\mathbb R^n$ are the 'path components of the real algebraic variety $X$'.

The set $S=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2:x^4+y^4=x^2+y^2\}$ is an irreducible algebraic variety having two path components.

 $$\sigma_{m}\circ \gamma (t)=\gamma (-t).$$ But in the question there was an assumption that $\gamma (t)$ is geodesic and I didn't use it. So my question is: is my line of thinking is correct, or I just completely wrong?","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"
693809,Understanding that $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ has two connected components,"I am trying to understand the proof of the theorem: $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ has two components. The proof says that The group of matrices with positive and negative determinant, $GL_n(\mathbb{R})_+$ and $GL_n(\mathbb{R})_-$, respectively are homeomorphic open subsets of $GL_n(\mathbb{R}).$  So it suffices to prove that $GL_n(\mathbb{R})_+$ is connected. I don't understand why they are homeomorphic and open. Could you help me?","['general-topology', 'matrices', 'lie-groups']"
693821,Is evaluation homomorphism surjective?,"Let $A^n$ be an affine space over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $\mathbb{C}[X_1,\cdots,X_n]$ be the polynomial ring of $n$ variables. Then $A^n\to (\mathbb{C}[X_1,\cdots,X_n])^*$ by evaluation homomorphism, where $(\mathbb{C}[X_1,\cdots,X_n])^*$ is the set of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{C}[X_1,\cdots,X_n]$ to $\mathbb{C}$.

693861,Harmonic map into sphere,"Let $B$ be the unit ball and $S$ the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Consider the map $u: B\rightarrow S$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
u^j(x)=\frac{x_j}{|x|}\quad\forall \ j =1, 2, 3.
\end{equation}I would like to show that for each $j=1, 2, 3,$ we have
\begin{equation}
-\triangle u^j=|Du|^2u^j\quad \text{in }B\setminus\{0\}.
\end{equation} My working is as below but I can't exactly establish the relationship; I am missing a factor of two and I don't know where I am going wrong. Firstly, we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u^j}{\partial x_i}=\frac{|x|\delta_{ij}-x_jx_i|x|^{-1}}{|x|^2}=\frac{\delta_{ij}}{|x|}-\frac{x_ix_j}{|x|^3}
\end{equation}where $\delta_{ij}=1$ if $i=j$ and zero otherwise. Consequently,
\begin{align}
|Du|^2=\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{i=1}^{3}\left(\frac{\partial u^j}{\partial x_i}\right)^2&=\sum_{j=1}^3\sum_{i=1}^{3}\frac{|x|^2\delta_{ij}-2\delta_{ij}x_ix_j+|x|^{-2}x_j^2x_i^2}{|x|^4}\\
&=\frac{3}{|x|^2}-\frac{2}{|x|^2}+\frac{1}{|x|^2}\\
&=\frac{2}{|x|^2}.
\end{align} So
\begin{equation}
|Du|^2u^j=\frac{2x_j}{|x|^3}.
\end{equation} For the left hand side, however, I end up with
\begin{align}
-\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\frac{\partial u^j}{\partial x_i}\right)&=\sum_{i=1}^3-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{|x|}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\left(\frac{x_ix_j}{|x|^3}\right)\\
&=\sum_{i=1}^3\frac{\delta_{ij}x_i}{|x|^3}+\frac{|x|^3x_j-3|x|x_i^2x_j}{|x|^6}\\
&=\frac{x_j}{|x|^3}
\end{align} Somewhere I am missing a factor of two and I can't spot it.","['multivariable-calculus', 'partial-differential-equations', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
693875,Whether a set is closed or not,"Denote by $C_{[0,1]}$ the ternary Cantor set on $[0,1]$. Now consider $[0,1] \setminus C_{[0,1]}$. It contains open intervals. Now define Cantor sets on all these open intervals by simply translating and dilating the standard Cantor set. Denote them as $C_{[a_i,b_i]}$. Now is the set $F=C_{[0,1]} \cup \bigcup C_{[a_i,b_i]}$ closed? My try: I wanted to show that its complement is open. I argued that the complement of $F$ consists of open intervals. So $F^c$ consists of unions of open intervals. Hence $F$ is closed. But my professor says it is not so. Is it because the open intervals are getting smaller every time? I do not understand where i am going wrong. Can any one please tell me where I am going wrong. Thanks","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'analysis']"
