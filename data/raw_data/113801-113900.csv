1658339,What can be said about $f$?,"I faced this question in an interview yesterday. QUESTION: We have a function $f$ depending on three variables $x_1,x_2,x_3$. Now the gradient of $f$ is perpendicular at any point
  $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$, or in mathematical language , $$\vec r \cdot \nabla f
 =0$$ Now what can be said about $f$ from this information? I could not make out anything from this. And I failed to proceed since I did not know the relation between $x_1,x_2,x_3$. I was given the hint that I should consider the function $f(t\vec r)$ where $t$ is a scalar and differentiate it with respect to $t$. I calculated it as:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\left[f(t\vec r)\right]=f'(t\vec r) \vec r$$ I was still unable to make any interpretation. I was asked what the $f'$ thing meant. I said that it was a derivative but he asked me what it signified. But I had no clue. Can anybody help me? P.S. You can take $\vec r=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$. The interviewer said nothing about this.

1658362,Is there a countably compact sequential non-$T_2$ space that is not sequentially compact?,"Let $X$ be a topological space. Definitions: $X$ is countably compact if every countable open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover or equivalently, every sequence in $X$ has a cluster point. $X$ is sequentially compact if every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence $X$ is sequential if every sequentially closed set is closed. It is known that if $X$ is countably compact + sequential + $T_2$ then $X$ is sequentially compact (see e.g. Engelking). The proof goes like this:
Let $x_n$ be a sequence in $X$. Since $X$ is countably compact $x_n$ has a cluster point $x \in X$. If $\{ n \mid x_n = x \}$ is infinite then we have a constant subsequence of $x_n$, thus convergent. So assume that $\{ n \mid x_n = x \}$ is finite such that there is some $n_0$ and $x_n \neq x$ for all $n \geq n_0$.
Consider the set $A := \{ x_n \mid n \geq n_0 \} \setminus \{ x \}$.
Then $A$ is not closed and since $X$ is sequential, $A$ is not sequentially closed. Thus, there is a sequence $y_k \in A$ and $y \in X \setminus A$ such that $y_k \to y$. Since $X$ is $T_2$ it follows that $y_k$ is not eventually constant since otherwise $y_k \to y_N \in A$ for some $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and $y_k \to y \in X \setminus A$ implies $y_N = y$ which is a contradiction. Thus, we have infinitely many $y_k$ in $A$ which can be finally used to construct a convergent subsequence of $x_n$. There are also other properties $\varphi$ such that countable compactness + $\varphi$ imply sequential compactness. As an example, $\varphi$ can be taken to be first-countable or even Fréchet-Urysohn (cluster points of injective sequences $x_n$ are accumulation points of the corresponding sets $x(\mathbb{N})$, thus lying in the closure and thus being able to be approximated by a sequence in $x(\mathbb{N})$ which can be used to generate a convergent subsequence of $x_n$). There is no need for an additional separation property. In my eyes, the Fréchet-Urysohn property is not ""too far"" away from the sequential property and thus it is a little bit ""strange"" that sequentialness needs an additional separation property. By ""too far"" I mean that typical spaces that are sequential but not Fréchet-Urysohn are a little bit pathological (e.g. Arens-Fort space). Questions: Is there some deeper insight, why we need a separation property for sequentialness but not for Fréchet-Urysohn? Is the separation property really needed, i.e. is there some sequential space which is countably compact but not sequentially compact? Remark: In fact, for the uniqueness of the sequential limit we can reduce the $T_2$ separation property to the $US$ separation property (i.e. $X$ is sequentially Hausdorff) which lies strictly between $T_1$ and $T_2$. This gives a hint, that $T_1$ should be not enough.","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples', 'compactness', 'separation-axioms']"
1658378,"The ""ring of characters"" of a finite group and its automorphisms","Let $G$ be a finite group and let $C(G)$ denote the set of characters of $G$ (in my representation theory course the values these characters take are in $\mathbb{C}$, but this is one point I'd like to ask about later). Then $C(G)$ has quite a lot of algebraic structure; if $\rho$ and $\sigma$ are two representations of $G$ with corresponding characters $\chi_\rho$ and $\chi_\sigma$ then $\chi_\rho +\chi_\sigma$ is again a character of $G$ corresponding to the representation $\rho \oplus \sigma$. Further, $\chi_\rho \cdot \chi_\sigma$ is a character of $G$ corresponding to the representation $\operatorname{Hom}(V^*, W)$, where $V$ and $W$ are the carrier spaces of $\rho$ and $\sigma$ respectively. So we are allowed to add and multiply characters together within $C(G)$, giving two operations on $C(G)$ which I'd assume interact nicely and satisfy the ring axioms except for the fact that the additive structure is not complete - additive inverses don't exist! So I suppose the natural thing to do is define $\mathbb{Z}C(G)$ as the free abelian group on $C(G)$; then $\mathbb{Z} C(G)$ is a ring. Now I'm aware of one automorphism of this ring; namely, complex conjugation of characters: if $\chi$ is a character of some representation $\rho$ with carrier space $V$ then $\bar{\chi}$ is the character of the representation $\rho^*: G\rightarrow GL(V^*)$ defined by $\rho^* (\phi) (v) = \phi(\rho(g^{-1})(v))$. So my questions are: What is sort of object is $\mathbb{Z} C(G)$? Are there special cases where it is a field? I've written down one automorphism of $\mathbb{Z} C(G)$, namely complex conjugation of characters. Are there other automorphisms coming from different modifications to representations, perhaps in the case that we consider our characters to take values in some general field $K$ rather than just $\mathbb{C}$? Is there a ""Galois theory"" of these automorphisms?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'representation-theory']"

1658397,Central Limit Theorem for a Lévy Process (mild assumptions),"I want to discuss the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) of a Lévy process  under some assumptions.
The answer of the previous post Central Limit Theorem for Lévy Process required a wide base of knowledge, without any assumptions on the Lévy process. So I'm considering now a more specific setup: Setup: Given a Lévy process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $E|X_1|<\infty$ (thus $E|X_t|<\infty$ for $t>0$) and finite second moment for all $t\geq 0$. Let $\Sigma$ be the positive definite covariance Matrix of $X_1$.
Then for $n:=\lceil t \rceil$ or $n:=\lfloor t \rfloor$ then 
$$
X_n=\sum_{i=1}^n X_1
$$
is considered (due to the Lévy property) as a partial sum of $n$ i.i.d. variables. 
Then by CLT we have 
$$
\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}-E[X_1]\right) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}\left(0,\Sigma\right) \text{ as } n\rightarrow \infty
$$
with covariance Matrix $\Sigma$. From this I want to conclude, that the CLT holds for real values $t$ also.(so I may avoid the proof a new CLT in continuous time for this given setup i.e. by characteristic functions).
So \begin{align}
\sqrt{t}\left(\frac{X_t}{t}-E[X_1]\right) \rightarrow \mathcal{N}\left(0,\Sigma\right) \text{ as } t \rightarrow \infty
\end{align} My idea Reduce the setting to the classical CLT by splitting up. Choose $n:=\lfloor t \rfloor$
\begin{align} 
\frac{X_t}{t}=\frac{n}{t}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}+\frac{X_t-X_n}{n}\right) \tag 1
\end{align} \begin{align}
\sqrt{t} \left(\frac{n}{t}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}+\frac{X_t-X_n}{n}\right)-E[X_1]\right)
\end{align}
Define $U_n:=\frac{1}{n} \sup_{t\in [n,n+1]}|X_t-X_n|$. $U_n$ is i.i.d. Since $E|X_{1}|<\infty$ it follows that $U_1$ has finite expectation, see Finite supremum . By classical Law of Large Number we have 
\begin{align}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n U_{n}\rightarrow E[U_1]\quad P\text{-a.s.}
\end{align} such that $n^{-1}U_{n}\rightarrow 0$ $P\text{-a.s.}$ (as $n\rightarrow \infty$ by $t\rightarrow \infty$) which implies convergence in distribution. Note that $U_n$ dominates the second term in the brackets in $(1)$. Then we can conclude from that, that (remark that $n:=\lfloor t \rfloor$)
$$
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\frac{X_t}{t}=\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}\frac{n}{t} \frac{X_{n}}{n}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{X_{n}}{n}\quad P\text{-a.s.}
$$
Now sandwich for $n:=\lfloor t \rfloor$
$$
\sqrt{n}\left(\frac{n}{t}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}+\frac{X_t-X_n}{n}\right)-E[X_1]\right)\leq \sqrt{t}\left(\frac{n}{t}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}+\frac{X_t-X_n}{n}\right)-E[X_1]\right) \leq \sqrt{n+1}\left(\frac{n}{t}\left(\frac{X_n}{n}+\frac{X_t-X_n}{n}\right)-E[X_1]\right)
$$

1658411,To what extent can the fondamental theorem of arithmetic be used to give a canonical form to non-integer numbers?,"The fundamental theorem of arithmetic gives us a unique way of writing any non-zero integer. For any $n \in \mathbb{Z}^*$, we have a unique decomposition :
$$n = (-1)^\epsilon \prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{N}^*} p_i^{\alpha_i}$$
where $\epsilon \in \{0, 1\}$, $p_i$ denotes the $i$-th prime number, and $(\alpha_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}^*}$ is a sequence of non-negative integers such that only a finite number of terms are different from $0$. Now, let $S_0$ denote $\mathbb{N}^*$. We construct by induction, for every $k \in \mathbb{N}^*$, the set $S_k$ of numbers that can be written as
$$(-1)^\epsilon \prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{N}^*} p_i^{\alpha_i}$$
where $\epsilon \in \{0, 1\}$, $p_i$ denotes the $i$-th prime number, and $(\alpha_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}^*}$ is a sequence of elements of $S_{k-1} \cup \{0\}$ such that only a finite number of terms are different from $0$. $S_1 = \mathbb{Z}^*$. $S_2 = \mathbb{Q}^*$. Moreover, the uniqueness of the decomposition is conserved. $S_3 = \{(-1)^\epsilon \sqrt[n]{q} \mid \epsilon \in \{0,1\}, q \in \mathbb{Q}_+^*, n \in \mathbb{N}^* \}$ and the uniqueness of the decomposition is still conserved. With $S_4$ appear the first transcendental numbers, and I am unsure about the uniqueness of the decomposition. So I have a few questions that maybe some of you could answer : Has this been studied before ? Do we always keep the uniqueness of the decomposition or do we lose it at some step ?

""Choosing"" who gets to attend the concert can be done in two ways. The first way (the RHS), we have $n+1$ number of tickets for sale but $n+r+1$ people who wants to buy the tickets. Thus, there are $\binom{n+r+1}{n+1}$ ways to ""choose"" who gets to attend the concert. The second way (the LHS) is to select the last person in line to buy the first ticket (I think this was the step I missed in my first attempt). Then, we choose $n$ from the remaining $n+r$ people to buy tickets. Or we can ban the last person in line from buying a ticket and choose the second-to-last person in line to buy the first ticket. Then, we have $\binom{n+r-1}n$ ways. This continues until we reach the case where we choose the $n+1$ person in line to buy the first ticket (banning everyone behind him/her from buying a ticket). This can be done in $\binom{n+0}n$ ways. Therefore, adding up each case on the LHS is equal to the RHS.","['combinations', 'combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

$$c = \frac{1}{\cos\phi}, \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \  \tan\phi = \frac{9.8}{f}\tan\alpha \implies \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9.8}{f}\tan\alpha\right).$$

$$u = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9.8}{f}\tan\alpha\right)\right)}\sin
\left(ft +\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{9.8}{f}\tan\alpha\right)\right) - \frac{9.8}{f}\tan\alpha,$$

Then $S^{-1}(C)$ is the integral closure of $S^{-1}A$ in $S^{-1}B$. In the proof, they show that every element $\frac bs \in S^{-1}B$ is integral over $S^{-1}A$, by multiplying the equation $$(\frac bs)^n+\frac {a_1} {s_1}(\frac bs)^{n-1}+...+\frac {a_n}{s_n}=0$$ by $(s \cdot \prod s_i)^n$, and claiming that this gives an integral equation in $A$ for $bs_1...s_n$. How do we justify going from an equation in the localization to an equation in the original ring, given that $A$ is not necessarily a domain?

  is nonempty Now, please note I am not a big fan of compactness. I'm trying to get used to it. That being said, I came up with an odd conclusion. My understanding of a compact space is that $X$ is compact if for every open covering, there is a finite subcovering. And an open covering is just a union of open subsets of $X$. So, well, if I assume that every family of ""closed"" subsets of $X$ has the finite intersection property... I concluded that $X$ can't have a bunch of open coverings. Because, say $V_i,V_j$ are distinct closed subsets of $X$. By the said property, the intersection is non empty. Equivalently, they share at least one element of $X$. Equivalently, $(X＼V_i) \cup (X＼V_j)$ will have a ""hole"" which is the part that $V_i,V_j$ have in common. So, since every open subset of $X$ must be in the form $X＼V_i$, the union of them will always have a ""hole"" because the closed subsets are guaranteed to have some element in common, whichever and how many I choose to intersect. And this ""hole"" there means that $X$ is not covered how ever many I gather $X＼V_i$s around. That one hole cannot be covered by open subsets. Therefore, even before considering finite subcoverings, $X$ does not have an open covering. Well, clearly my conclusion ""should"" be wrong. Problem, is, where and why. I drew a picture with just $2$ closed subsets of $X$ in $X$ but indeed I get a hole in the picture. Can someone tell me what is wrong with my reasoning?","['general-topology', 'analysis']"

1659061,Basic formality when considering random numbers,"Suppose we are interested in randomly picking numbers in the interval $[0,1]$ with the uniform distribution. If I want to write a mathematical text about this, it can be done by saying that $X$ is a random variable with uniform distribution in $[0,1]$, or $X\sim U[0,1]$ for short. Then I can analyze the expected value of $X$, it's variance, some particular probabilities and so on. By analyzing $X$, I'm analyzing the process of picking numbers described above. In practice, I'm able to do that, and if asked to formalize more about this random variable, I would introduce a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$, say that $X:\Omega\to[0,1]$ is a measurable function, talk about it's density function and so on. Everything ok to this point. Usually the sample space $\Omega$ stands for some concrete (real world) problem we are interested in and $X$ translates this concrete in numbers (so we can use mathematics). But in this case there is no concrete, we are only interested in numbers. We really just want the codomain of $X$, not the domain. So I considered two explanations of how we should interpret $\Omega$: 1) We just let $\Omega$ undefined. It is there just to formalize the notion of a measurable function. 2) $\Omega = [0,1]$ and $X(\omega) = \omega$, for all $\omega\in [0,1]$. My two questions are: How should we interpret $\Omega$ in this situation? And what are the differences between my two interpretations (is one of them more right )?

What I want to know is what are the conditions on a family of isomorphisms as described above to have come from a connection. I feel like just the above should be nearly enough, but there should also be some condition saying that this choice of operator ""varies smoothly"".

for all $A,B \in \mathcal{A}$. Any dirac measure $\delta_x$ for some $x \in X$ is multiplicative. Do there exist nonzero multiplicative measures that are not dirac measures? If so, then can we make additional assumptions on the measurable space and the measure such that nonzero multiplicative implies dirac? The implication is true if $X$ is a compact Hausdorff space and $\mu$ is a regular Borel measure on $X$, but does it hold in more general circumstances? EDIT: As Jonas pointed out, $(*)$ becomes meaningless if $\mu(A) = 0$ and $\mu(B) = \infty$, so we should not require $(*)$ to hold for pairs of measurable sets where one has measure zero and the other has measure infinity. EDIT: Under no extra assumptions, $\mathcal{A} = \{\emptyset, X\}$ with $\mu(X) = \infty$ is a counter-example, though a rather uninteresting one. If we assume that at least one measurable set $A$ has finite positive measure then if $\mu(B)=\infty$ we get $\infty > \mu(A) \geq \mu(A \cap B) = \mu(A)\mu(B) = \infty$, a contradiction, so no sets can have infinite measure in this case.

1659695,Proving continuity/smoothness for a special function on a Lie group.,"So I asked this question , yesterday, forgetting the compactness requirement. Jack Lee commented shortly afterwards, noting that, if we take an inner product on the Lie algebra $T_eG$ of a Lie group $G$, extend it to a left-invariant metric on $G$, and define: $$(u,v)_g=\int\limits_G\langle\mathrm{d}_gR_h(u),\mathrm{d}_gR_h(v)\rangle_{gh}d\mu(h),$$ where $\mu$ is the unique left-invariant Haar measure that exists on $G$, the integral might not converge. If $G$ is not compact. So I wondered why compactness ensured convergence, and he said the integrand is continuous, hence integrable on a compact set. Now I can see how continuous would imply bounded. But I'm not too sure I can always guarantee a compact set will have finite measure and hence allow integration of constants. In fact, reading that pdf again, the Haar measure is defined to have this property, and in the construction, the property is evident. But above all, I'm not too sure how to prove continuity. I was thinking I could maybe show the two entries of the metric are smooth vector fields, but then $h\mapsto\mathrm{d}_gR_h(u)$ with $u$ tangent at $g$ is not a vector field because it outputs something not tangent at $h$, but at $gh$. So perhaps I could use the left-invariance of $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ to get actual vector fields and work on those: $$\langle\mathrm{d}_gR_h(u),\mathrm{d}_gR_h(v)\rangle = \langle(\mathrm{d}_hL_g)^{-1}\mathrm{d}_gR_h(u),(\mathrm{d}_hL_g)^{-1}\mathrm{d}_gR_h(v)\rangle_h.$$ Now the two entries are vector fields, so if I show they are smooth, since I know $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is a metric, I conclude the integrand is smooth, hence continuous.

As I understand their statement of classical probability: ... Classical probability is the propertion of times that an event will occur assuming that all outcomes in are sample space a equally likely to occur... So as I understand it, we assume each outcome is equally likely, so for, say a die roll my sample space, the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment, is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} . Ie. $$
   P(A)=\frac{number\ of\ outcomes\ relevant\ to\ event\ A}{total\ number\ of\ outcomes} = \frac{N_A}{N}
$$ My first question had been: Is it correct to say that we have to assume each outcome is equally
likely? My thinking had been this: So if I want the probability I roll a 6, for example, the number of relevant outputs is len({6}) = 1 and the total number of outcomes is len({1,2,3,4,5,6}) = 6 , so I would say P(6) is 1/6. But what if my dice is unfair. How can I represent this in classical probability? The number of outcomes remain the same... what tools does classic probability have to allow for this? Or is this where relative frequency probability is required? The reason I was asking is that I couldn't see how we could, using classical probability, model a biased dice for example. I think now that it can't and that to  model events of unequal probability we need relative frequency probability. All I was asking for was confirmation that my thinking on this was correct. It seems there has been quite dome disagreement on it, but above is a verbatim quote from the book. So... given this, the book also makes the following definitions: Sample Space = The set of all possible basic outcomes from a random experiment. Population = The complete set of items or ""events"" of interest. Size is very large, denoted N, possibly infinite. So my next question had been, Is the ""sample space"" in this case (for classical probability) also the population? . Still not sure if sample space is the same as population: I have understood ""sample space"" as ""the set of all possible basic outcomes from a random experiment."" I have understood population as ""the complete set of items or ""events"" of interest""... so surely all possible results of an experiment must be the complete set of items of interest, so the two terms are equivalent? This seems wrong to me, but I don't have a grasp as to why? In fact even in relative frequency probability, how do these two terms really differ.",['statistics']

1660079,$15$ integers $m_1 \ldots m_{15}$such that $ \sum _{k=1} ^{15} m_k \arctan {k} = \arctan 16$,"Determine whether or not there exist $15$ integers $m_1 \ldots m_{15}$ such that $ \sum _{k=1} ^{15} m_k \cdot  \arctan (k) = \arctan (16)$. This is a question from IMC 2015 Day 1 Problem. Here is the link for the solution. Their solution goes like this. Suppose that the equation is satisfied by some integers $ m_1, \ldots ,m_{15}$. Then the argument of the complex number $ z_1 = 1+16i$ coincides with the argument of $$z_2 = (1+i)^{m_1} (1+2i)^{m_2} \cdots \cdots (1+15i)^{m_{15}}$$ Therefore the ratio $R=z_1/z_2$ is real and nonzero. As $Re(z_1)=1$ and $Re(z_2)$ is an integer, $R$ is an integer. So we get $$(1+16^2)R^2=\prod ^{15} _{k=1} (1+k^2)^{m_k} $$. Since $1+16^2=257$ is prime, which yields an easy contradiction through $p$-adic valuations. My thought is that if one of $m_i$'s is negative then $Re(z_2)$ is not necessarily integer. On the other hand all of $m_i$'s cant be positive since $ \arctan 1 + \arctan 2 > \arctan 16$. Whats the solution to the problem?","['number-theory', 'contest-math', 'complex-numbers']"

Based on the Wilks theorem,under null hypothesis that $H_{0}: \theta=\theta_{0}$ ,one have that $-2\log\left(f(x\mid \theta_{0})/f(x\mid \hat\theta)\right)\to \chi_{1}^{2}$ as $n\to\infty$.

1660187,Affine $k$-algebras and reduced rings,"In my question, $k$ is a field, and all $k$-algebras are assumed to be finitely generated.  A $k$-algebra $A$ is said to be affine if $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is reduced.  I am trying to prove the following: If $A$ is an affine $k$-algebra, and $B$ is a reduced ring containing $k$, then $A \otimes_k B$ is reduced. Since $A$ is $k$-flat, we can regard $A \otimes_k B_0$ as a subring of $A \otimes_k B$ for any subring $B_0$ of $B$ containing $k$.  So without loss of generality we can assume that $B$ is finitely generated. We can write $A = k[X]/I$ and $B = k[Y]/J$ for some ideals $I$ and $J$ of the polynomial rings $k[X], k[Y]$.  Clearly $A$ is reduced, since $A \simeq A \otimes_k k$ is embedded in $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$, which is reduced.  So $I$ and $J$ are radical ideals.  Writing $I$ as an intersection of its finitely many minimal primes, we can embed $A$ into a direct sum of fields (take the quotient fields of all the $k[X]/\mathfrak p$). The same can be done with $B$.  So the tensor product $A \otimes_k B$ is isomorphic to a subring of a direct sum of tensor products of fields over $k$.  In order to show that direct sum is reduced, it seems like we need to know something about the quotient fields of the $k[X]/\mathfrak p$, where $\mathfrak p$ is a minimal prime containing $I$. Somehow the fact that $A \otimes_k \overline{k}$ is reduced is coming into play here.","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

would appreciate your attention and critique. this is what I did: given: $\forall {x\in X}: x\in A$ Need to prove: $\forall y\in X\cap B: y\in A$ So $y\in X \cap B$ implies $y\in X$ and $y\in B$. Then from the statment '$p\land q \to p$' it follows that $y \in X$, but we also know that $X\subseteq A$. Hence $y \in A$. Therefore we conclude that: $X\cap B \subseteq A$.
