394092,Valid Proof that the Irrationals are Uncountable?,"So I originally wanted to prove that the reals are uncountable, but the best solution I came up with was to prove the irrationals are uncountable so therefore the reals must be as well. I suppose my first question is, is this valid logic? Next take any countable subset of $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$, put it as $S$. Since it's countable $\exists \; a : S \to \mathbb{N}$ whereas $a$ is bijective. Because it's bijective, $\exists \; b : \mathbb{N} \to S$ similarly bijective whereas $b$ is the inverse of $a$. Now let's form an irrational, put it as $s$. Start with the number defined as '$0.$'. The $n$th place after the decimal place the $n$th digit of $b_n$ with one added to it (if the $n$th digit of $b_n$ is $9$ put it to be $0$). It's clear that this number $s$ is not in the set $S$ so it follows that any countable subset of $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ is a strict subset, so $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ must be uncountable (otherwise it would apparently be a strict subset of itself...). Now since $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ is uncountable it follows that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. P.S. I tag this as topology because it's introduced in ""basic topology"" in Rudin EDIT: as William and Thomas pointed out this isn't exactly valid, there is no guarantee that $s \in \mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$. So we can say let $S$ be a countable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ so $\exists \; a : S \to \mathbb{N}$ and similarly the inverse of $a$, $b : \mathbb{N} \to S$ and so form $s$ as the number $0.$ with the $n$th digit after the decimal point to be either the $n$th digit of $b_n$ (extending the number with as many $0$'s as needed) plus one or if that number turns out to be $10$, place $0$ there. Then it's clear that $s \not\in S$ so every countable subset is a strict subset so $\mathbb{R}$ must be uncountable. It then must follow that $\mathbb{R} \backslash \mathbb{Q}$ is uncountable since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, and taking a countable number of things from an uncountable number of things will clearly result in an uncountable number of things.","['general-topology', 'elementary-set-theory']"

394145,Attaching two manifolds along their boundary,"I have a question about a proof in John Lee's Introduction to Topological Manifolds. Suppose $M$ and $N$ are two topological $n$-manifolds with nonempty boundary (for reference, the definition I am using is: $M$ and $N$ are second countable Hausdorff spaces such that each point has an open neighborhood homeomorphic to either an open set in $\mathbf{R}^n$ or an open set in $\mathbf{H}^n = \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \mathbf{R}^n: x_n \geq 0\}$). If $\partial M$ and $\partial N$ denote the manifold boundaries of $M$ and $N$, suppose $h: \partial N \to \partial M$ is a homeomorphism. We may attach $M$ and $N$ along their boundaries by forming the adjuction space $$ M \cup_h N = \frac{M \sqcup N}{\sim}$$ where $\sim$ is the relation generated by identifying $x\in \partial N$ with $h(x)$. The theorem is: With $M$, $N$, and $h$ as above, $M \cup_h N$ is an $n$-manifold (without boundary). The proof first proceeds to show that each point of the adjuction space has a euclidean neighborhood. If $q: M \sqcup N \to M \cup_h N$ denotes the quotient map, then Lee puts $S=q(\operatorname{Int} M \cup \operatorname{Int} N)$ (where $\operatorname{Int}$ denotes the manifold interior) and shows that each point of $M \cup_h N -S$ has a euclidean neighborhood. I am OK with this argument. Now, I quote: Suppose $s\in S$, and let $y \in \partial N$ and $x=h(y) \in \partial M$ be two points in the fiber $q^{-1}(s)$. We can choose coordinate charts $(U,\phi)$ for $M$ and $(V, \psi)$ for $N$ such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$, and let $\hat{U}=\phi(U)$, $\hat{V} = \psi(V) \subseteq \mathbf{H}^n$. It is useful in this proof to identify $\mathbf{H}^n$ with $\mathbf{R}^{n-1}\times [0,\infty)$ and $\mathbf{R}^n$ with $\mathbf{R}^{n-1} \times \mathbf{R}$. By shrinking $U$ and $V$ if necessary, we may assume $h(V \cap \partial N) = U \cap \partial M$, and that $\hat{U} = U_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$ and $\hat{V} = V_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$ for some $\epsilon>0$ and some open subsets $U_0,V_0 \subseteq \mathbf{R}^{n-1}$. My question: How does one choose the coordinate domains $U$ and $V$ to satisfy these two conditions simultaneously? I know how to choose $U$ and $V$ such that $h(V \cap \partial N) = U \cap \partial M$, and I know how to choose $U$ and $V$ such that their images under the coordinate maps are equal to sets of the form $U_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$ and $V_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$, but I don't know how to pick $U$ and $V$ such that both of these conditions are satisfied at the same time. EDIT: Let me be a bit more specific. We are to choose the coordinate domains (by shrinking if necessary) to satsify the following two conditions simultaneously: (a) $h(V \cap \partial N) = U \cap \partial M$, (b) $\hat{U} = U_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$ and $\hat{V} = V_0 \times [0,\epsilon)$. Now, assuming that I have adjusted $U$ and $V$ to satisfy (a), then I may adjust them further to satisfy (b). But then how do I know that $U$ and $V$ still satisfy (a)? I can be more specific by what I mean by ""adjust"" if neeeded. Am I misreading the proof, or am I missing something glaringly obvious?","['general-topology', 'manifolds']"

  that the system of linear equations $Ax = b$ has a solution in

394620,square cake with raisins,"Alice bakes a square cake, with $n$ raisins (= points). Bob cuts $p$ square pieces. They are axis-aligned, interior-disjoint, and each piece must contain at least $2$ raisins. Note that a single raisin can be shared by two pieces (if it is on their boundary), or even four pieces (if it is on their corner). Bob tries to maximize the number of pieces $p$, and Alice tries to minimize $p$ by a sophisticated placement of the raisins. For a given $n$ (number of raisins), how should Alice place the raisins such as to minimize $p$, and what is the minimum? Here are some simple cases: For n=0, 1, obviously p=0. For n=2, 3, 4, Alice can make p=1, by placing the raisins on the corners of the cake, since the only square piece that can contain 2 raisins is the entire cake. For n=5, the minimum p is 2: there is at least one quarter of the cake that contains 2 raisins. Bob can cut a piece that contains these 2 raisins on its boundary, and is entirely contained within that quarter of the cake. Now there is enough room for another square, that contains one of these raisins and another raisin. What is the minimum $p$ for a given $n$? - Some insights: Given two raisins, the minimum length of a square that contains both of them is the chessboard distance between them. Therefore, it seems that Alice's best strategy is to maximize the  chessboard distances, and so force Bob to use large squares. This makes sense, but I cannot prove this. If n is a square number ($n = k^2$), then Alice can place the raisins in a k-by-k grid, such that the smallest chessboard distance between raisins is $1/(k-1)$. In this case, Bob can cut at most $(k-1)^2$ squares. But is this really Alice's best strategy? Bob can always do best with pieces that have raisins only on their boundary (He never has to cut a piece which has a raisin in the interior). PROOF: For any two raisins, there is a square that contains both of them in the boundary. If a piece contains two raisins in the interior, or one in the interior and one in the boundary, Bob can shrink that piece to get a square that has these two raisins in the boundary. This square will be entirely contained in the original square, and so will not affect the other pieces.","['geometry', 'discrete-optimization', 'combinatorial-geometry', 'discrete-geometry']"

394739,Uniformly solvable families of polynomials,"It is a famous theorem that there is no ""quintic formula"", i.e. there is no formula which expresses the roots of a quintic polynomial $x^5+a_4x^4+\cdots+a_0$ in terms of $a_4,\ldots,a_0$ and rational constants using the field operations and taking $n$th roots. But the standard proof of this actually proves something which on its face seems stronger: that there are particular quintics with roots that cannot be expressed in terms of rational numbers using these operations. The non-existence of a quintic formula merely requires that there be no ""uniform"" way of doing so. I'm wondering if this is actually a stronger statement. To make this rigorous: Given $f(a_0,\ldots,a_k,x)\in \mathbb Q(a_0,\ldots,a_k)[x]$, we can define the family of polynomials associated to $f$ to be the set of polynomials $f(t_0,\ldots,t_k,x)\in \mathbb Q[x]$ where $t_0,\ldots,t_k\in \mathbb Q$ are such that this expression is defined. For example, the family of polynomials associated to $x^2+a_1x+a_0$ is the set of monic quadratic polynomials. If there an $f\in \mathbb Q(a_0,\ldots,a_k)[x]$ which does not admit a formula for its roots (in the variable $t$) in terms of elements of $\mathbb Q(a_0,\ldots,a_k)$, field operations and taking $n$th roots, yet every polynomial in the family of polynomials associated to $f$ does? From the point of view of Galois theory, the question becomes whether there exist polynomials $f\in \mathbb Q(a_0,\ldots,a_k)[x]$ which are not solvable over $\mathbb Q(a_0,\ldots,a_k)$, but evaluating them at any point $(t_0,\ldots,t_k)\in\mathbb Q$ (for which the result is defined) gives a polynomial solvable over $\mathbb Q$?","['galois-theory', 'commutative-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra']"

394816,Line Integral of Every Positively Oriented Simple Closed Path - Green's Theorem,"This question is from Example #5, Section 16.4 on P1059 of Calculus , 6th Ed, by James Stewart. Given Question: If $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \left(\dfrac{-y}{x^2 + y^2}, \dfrac{x}{x^2 + y^2}\right)$, show that $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 2\pi $ for every positively oriented simple closed path that encloses the origin. Part of the Given Solution: Since $C$ is an ARBITRARY closed path that encloses the origin, it's difficult to compute the given integral directly. So let's consider a counterclockwise circle $A$ with center the origin and radius $a$, where $a$ is chosen to be small enough that $A$ lies inside $C$, as indicated by the picture below. Let $D$ be the region bounded by $C$ and $A$. Then positively oriented $\partial D = C \cup (-A)$. So the version of Green Theorem's applied to regions with holes gives: $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} + \int_{-A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_D \underbrace{(\partial_x Q - \partial_y P)}_{\Large{= 0}} \, dA $
  $\Longrightarrow \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$. (Rest of solution omitted) $\Large{\text{Q1.}}$ I can't perceive how one would divine to construct $A$ to solve this problem. So I feel that my following solution is more intuitive. Is it really? However, I don't seem to need Green's Thoerem. How and where would it be applied? My solution: It's hard to calculate $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} $. The idea then is to find one $A$ so that $(\dagger) \int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$ is easier to compute and $(\ddagger)\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$. Now, $(\ddagger) \iff \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \huge{\color{red}{-}} \normalsize\int_A \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0 \iff \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}  +\int_{\huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A}}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0 $
$\iff \int_{\Large{\partial D} \normalsize{ \, = \, (C} \, \cup \huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A})}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0$. For $\partial D$ to be positively oriented, $C$ and $\color{red}{-}A$ must both be positively oriented $\Longrightarrow A$ must be NEGATIVELY oriented, so $D$ must be to the right of $A$. One convenient choice of $A$ would just be a counterclockwise circle with center the origin and the radius $a$. $\Large{\text{Q2.}}$ Why don't I get the requested answer if I pick $A$ as a counterclockwise ellipse enclosing the origin? In other words, $A$ is parameterised via $r(t) = (a\cos t, b\sin t), 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi $. Then $\int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_0^{2 \pi} \left(\dfrac{-b\sin t}{a^2 \cos^2 t + b^2 \sin^2 t},\dfrac{a\cos t}{a^2 \cos^2 t + b^2 \sin^2 t} \right) \cdot (-a\sin t, b \cos t) \, dt$. $ = ab \int_0^{2 \pi} \dfrac{1}{a^2 \cos^2 t + b^2 \sin^2 t} \, dt $. If $a = b$, then the requested answer follows by inspection. But what if $a \neq b$? $\Large{\text{Supplementaries to Muphrid's Answer: }}$ $\Large{\text{Q1.1.}}$ To rephrase your answer, are you saying that my solution has to justify why there exists an $A \ni \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}. ?$ 
This is true because $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \int_{A} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} \iff \int_{\Large{\partial D} \normalsize{ \, = \, (C} \, \cup \huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A})}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0, $ 
where the last equation is true by Green's Theorem: $\int_{\Large{\partial D} \normalsize{ \, = \, (C} \, \cup \huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A})}} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_D \underbrace{(\partial_x Q - \partial_y P)}_{\Large{= 0}} \, dA. $ $\Large{\text{Q1.2.}}$ I wrote that $\partial D \normalsize{ \, = \, (C} \, \cup \huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A})} $. Are you saying that this is wrong and that $\partial D \normalsize{ \, \subsetneqq \, (C} \, \cup \huge{\color{red}{-}\normalsize{A})} $? $\Large{\text{Q1.3.}}$ I understand that $\mathbf{F}(0,0)$ is undefined.

394896,Why is learning modern algebraic geometry so complicated?,"Many students - myself included - have a lot of problems in learning scheme theory. I don't think that the obstacle is the extreme abstraction of the subject, on the contrary, this is really the strong point of modern algebraic geometry. I'm reading many books such those written by Hartshorne, Gortz & Wedhorn, Liu, Vakil (notes), Gathmann (notes), Shafarevich, Perrin and Milne (notes) and in my humble opinion the learning problems arise from the following considerations: It is enlightening to read about ""the aim"" of modern algebraic geometry, so I'm referring to: motivations behind schemes, the correpondence between algebraic and geometric entities (so the duality between  the category of affine schemes and the category of rings), the importance of sheaves (so the concept of admissible functions) etc. But, despite this, when one goes into the actual construction of the new objects, all theorems, lemmas and propositions are missing details (that are left to the reader). For example the verification that  certain presheaves are sheaves, functorial properties of assignments between categories and details about limit/colimit constructions are often missing. Even if the student has a solid background in algebra and geometry, generally they don't have the time or the capacity to complete all the statements. Basically taking a course in algebraic geometry implies that one must take many statements as acts of faith. I realize that authors and professors may have the same difficulties (especially lack of time) in writing down all the boring details, and moreover that a book with all proofs may include thousands of pages, but in this way students are encouraged (read discouraged) to simply memorize the most important results without really understanding the constructions. Finally, a book or a course characterized by explanations and by motivating as complete proofs is much more instructive than a book or a course which covers many advanced arguments IMHO. In mathematics when two object are isomorphic, it is a common practise to ""identify"" them. Basically if $A\cong B$ but $A$ has a simple description we write $A$ instead of $B$ , but formally we are thinking of $B$ . This procedure is used very often in algebraic geometry, but in some cases without explaining the isomorphisms and in other cases the two objects in question are considered ""really the same"" even if this can provoke formal problems (look for example here ). This ""abuse of identifications"" often makes one lose sight of the essence of what one is studying and once again the ""stupid student"", exhausted, tends to simply memorize things. I point again that the problem is not the abstraction, but the fact that the excessive tendency to simplify notation, often leads to inconsistencies. Enough importance is not given to the following: the process of successive generalizations, put in place by the great mathematicians across history, which marked the birth of modern algebraic geometry. This process is fundamental in learning because it probably represents the most natural way whereby the human mind can deal with the subject. In summary, because of the above issues (principally the first two), rigorous mathematical statements, incredibly seem to be informal dissertations at the eyes of the student that is eager for formalism. In your opinion, what are the most common difficulties that a student encounters during their learning process of algebraic geometry? If my problems do arise precisely from the above considerations, can you give me some advice to solve them?","['algebraic-geometry', 'self-learning', 'soft-question']"

Suppose by contradiction that $A \cap \bar{Y} \neq \emptyset$. Then $\exists \ x \in A \cap \bar{Y}$. I need help formalizing this reasoning  (or correcting if it is wrong) By the definition of $A$ open, $\exists \ U \subset A$ open neighborhood of $x$. Then my idea is to prove that $U \cap Y \neq \emptyset$ because $U$ in somewhat sense ""touches"" $Y$, because it's a neighborhood of $x$. But i can't write down a formal demonstration.
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks^^",['general-topology']
394954,Simplify with fractional exponents and negative exponents,"I am trying to simplify $$ \left(\frac{3x ^{3/2}y^3}{x^2 y^{-1/2}}\right)^{-2} $$ It seems pretty simple at first. I know that a negative exponent means you flip a fraction. So I flip it. $$  \left(\frac{x^2 y^{-1/2}}{3x^{3/2}y^3}\right)^2$$ Now I need to square it, which is tricky because there are a lot of weird rules with squaring. This is probably where I went wrong. $$  \left(\frac{x^2 y^{-1/2}}{9x^{3/2}y^3}\right)$$ Now I need to try and simplify things. I know that I can get rid of the $x$ on top since there is a larger one on the bottom. $4/2 - 3/2 = 1/2$ $$  \left(\frac{x^{1/2} y^{-1/2}}{9y^3}\right)$$ Now I need to get rid of the $y$ exponent. I am not sure how that is possible.","['fractions', 'algebra-precalculus']"
394960,Express $4+\sqrt{-2}$ as a product of irreducibles,"This is part of an old Oxford Part A exam paper. (1992 A1) Suppose we equip $R=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$ with the Euclidean function $d$ defined by $$d(m+n\sqrt{-2})=|m+n\sqrt{-2}|^2$$
I want to determine the units of $R$ and express $4+\sqrt{-2}$ as a product of irreducibles and to use this to determine how many ideals of $R$ contain $4+\sqrt{-2}$. Progress I think I have shown that the only units are $1,-1$, but cannot see how one can show this element is a product of irreducibles. In general, we have that in a Euclidean Domain every element is a finite product of irreducibles, but I cannot see how to calculate them. Thanks","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
394975,Generalising the Chinese Remainder Theorem,"We have that for $I,J$ ideals of some ring $R$ with $R=I+J$ , $$\frac{R}{I\cap J} \cong \frac{R}{I} \times \frac{R}{J}$$ My question is whether the analogous expression for three ideals $I,J,K$ where $R=I+J+K$ is true? I think I have found a counterexample with $R=\mathbb{Z}$ , $I=2\mathbb{Z}$ , $J=2\mathbb{Z}$ , $K=3\mathbb{Z}$ . Here, $R=I+J+K$ and $\frac{R}{I\cap J\cap K}=\frac{R}{I \cap K}=\frac{\mathbb{Z}}{6\mathbb{Z}} \cong \frac{R}{I} \times \frac{R}{K}$ We have that $\frac{R}{I} \times \frac{R}{K}$ is not isomorphic to $\frac{R}{I} \times \frac{R}{J}\times \frac{R}{K}$ and so this is our counterexample. Can someone please check this counterexample is sound? Thanks","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
394988,Calculating in quotient ring of $\mathbb{R}[X]$,"Part of an old Oxford exam (1992 A1) We want to find which elements of the quotient ring $\mathbb{R}[X]/(x^3-x^2+x-1)$ are equal to their own square. Now, we note first that $x^3-x^2+x-1=(x-1)(x^2+1)$ Let $f(x)=(x-1)(x^2+1)$. Clearly we have $[1+(f(x))]^2=[1+(f(x))]$ but I cannot see how to find others. Any guidance would be appreciated.

395004,"Quadratic Equation with ""0"" coefficients","Let's say I have two objects $x$ and $y$ whose position at time $t$ is given by:
$$
x = a_xt^2+b_xt+c_x \\
y= a_yt^2+b_yt+c_y
$$ And I want to find which (if any) values of $t$ cause $x$ to equal $y$. That is
$$
(a_x-a_y)t^2+(b_x-b_y)t+(c_x-c_y) = 0
$$ This can easily be solved with quadratic equation. But what about the case when $a_x = a_y$? Now obviously this makes the problem much simpler to solve by hand! But if I were writing, lets say a simulation, where $a_x$ didn't necessarily equal $a_y$, but it could, how would I go about solving the equation? Preferably I'm looking for some sort of algorithm/equation that I can use to avoid having to write separate logic for the cases where $a_x = a_y$ and $a_x \neq a_y$. Quick background: I have knowledge of math up to Linear Algebra (I feel a very simple answer lies here, but I can't quite work it out) and ~1/2 a course in Differential Equations (though I think that doesn't really apply here), but I'm more than willing to learn something new if it provides an easy way of solving my problem.

395028,How to deal with polynomial quotient rings,"The question is quite general and looks to explore the properties of quotient rings of the form $$\mathbb{Z}_{m}[X] / (f(x)) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbb{R}[X]/(f(x))$$ 
where $m \in \mathbb{N}$ Classic examples of how one can treat such rings is to  find relationships like $$\mathbb{Z}[x]/(1-x,p) \cong \mathbb{Z_{p}}$$ for prime $p$. However, I often struggle to intuitively understand what the elements of such rings are, and they to compute using them. For example, what do the elements of the set $\mathbb{Z}_{2}[X] / (x^4+1)$ actually look like. Can this set be described in a clearer way to help understand the way the rings work. Is there some general way of describing elements of such rings so that isomorphisms and computations become easier to handle? Apologies if this question is not sufficiently clear.","['ring-theory', 'polynomial-rings', 'abstract-algebra']"
