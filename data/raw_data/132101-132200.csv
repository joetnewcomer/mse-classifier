2068802,Quotient maps in algebraic geometry,"In topology, a quotient map is a surjective map $\pi:X\to Y$ such that $V\subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $\pi^{-1}(V)$ is open in X. This definition has the following nice property: If $\rho:X\to Z$ is a continuous map and $f:Y\to Z$ is any map of sets such that $\rho=f\circ \pi$, then $f$ is continuous. What is the corresponding concept of quotient map in the category of quasi-projective varieties? Is it only $\textit{surjective regular map}$? A more concrete question: let $\pi:X\to Y$ be a surjective regular map of quasi-projective varieties. Is it true that for any regular map $\rho:X\to Z$, a map of sets $f:Y\to Z$ such that $\rho=f\circ\pi$ is necessarily a regular map?",['algebraic-geometry']

2068829,Conformal map of an annulus onto a strip to solve BVP?,"I have a problem involving conformal maps on annuli, about which I can't find very much at all here on SE, nor in two or three Complex Analysis texts. My difficulty involves firstly a wrinkle in solving under-specified Dirichlet problems, and latterly in transforming the annulus. The problem is as follows: Write down the solution $u(x,y)$ to the Dirichlet problem for the following region and boundary conditions:
  $$U = \{x+iy:0 \leq y \leq1\}, \qquad u(x,0)=0, \qquad u(x,1)=1$$
  Hence, using appropriate conformal maps, solve the Dirichlet problem for the region with boundary conditions:
  $$V = \{z: r \leq |z| \leq R \}, \qquad u(z)=0 \;\textrm{when} \; |z|=r, \qquad u(z)=1 \;\textrm{when} \; |z|=R,  $$ Firstly, $U$ is an infinite horizontal strip, so has no boundary conditions for $x$. Clearly $u(x,y)=y$ is one such solution, but given then region is unbounded am I right in thinking we don't have uniqueness? The method I'm used to via separation of variables and Fourier analysis doesn't get me very far. Secondly, I take it we wish to conformally map the annulus $V$ onto the strip $U$. But $U$ is simply connected and $V$ is not, so surely this can't be possible? Happily glossing over the first question, with the latter I am not sure how to proceed. Any comments welcomed! Update Jan '17: Following comments, I think this is how these regions look on the Riemann sphere! The strip maps to the half of the sphere that lies in/over/under (you get the idea!) the upper half plane $\mathbb {H} : \Im (z) \geqslant 0$ minus a circle (?) from the pole $N$ to the point $i$ on the circumference. The annulus maps onto a 'belt' around the circumference. So actually, to shift between the two, could we slide the strip-projection down underneath the sphere (to avoid going through $N$) and fit it onto the belt?","['complex-analysis', 'conformal-geometry', 'mobius-transformation']"

2068876,How to explicitly perform the circle eversion in the $3$-dimensional space?,"The following claim is a well-known consequence of the Whitney-Graustein theorem : Claim. It does not exist $H\colon\mathbb{S}^1\times[0,1]\overset{C^1}{\rightarrow}\mathbb{R}^2$ such that for all $t\in [0,1]$, $H(\cdot,t)\colon\mathbb{S}^1\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ is an immersion, $H(\cdot,0)=(\cos(2\pi\cdot),\sin(2\pi\cdot))$ and $H(\cdot,1)=(\cos(2\pi \cdot),-\sin(2\pi\cdot))$. In other words, it is impossible to perform a circle eversion in the plane, namely it is impossible to continuously and regularly change the orientation of the circle while sticking to the plane. However, I want to illustrate that it is possible to realize the circle eversion in the $3$-dimensional space. The idea is to thicken the circle into a cylinder, perform a $\pi$-twist on the cylinder in order to put its inside out and finally to retract the everted cylinder onto its equatorial circle. My main concern is to graphically represent the above process using a mathematical software, e.g. SageMath. I tried in vain to write down explicit formulas for it and here I am stuck. Please note that the following homotopy did not seem to do any good: $$\forall x\in\mathbb{S}^1\times [-1,1],\forall t\in [0,1],H(x,t)=\frac{x}{\|x\|^{2t}}.$$ Any enlightenment will be greatly appreciated!","['circles', 'orientation', 'differential-geometry', 'homotopy-theory']"

2068935,Practical aspect of diffeomorphisms,"I've been trying to learn differential geometry (for awhile now), and one thing that has confused me a little is what it means from a practical perspective to have a diffeomorphism between two manifolds. I understand the basic concept of equivalence: for instance, in algebra, when I hear: ""These two groups are isomorphic,"" I have no problem thinking of them as exactly the same thing up to a (superficial) renaming of the elements. And in topology, when I hear: ""These two spaces are homeomorphic,"" I have no problem visualizing one space to be exactly the same as the other up to some (superficial) stretching or twisting. However, in differential geometry, when I hear: ""These manifolds are diffoemorphic,"" I'm not really sure how to think about them and the situation seems less straightforward to me. Maybe this is because I'm associating a lot of additional things to a manifold which do not come purely from it's smooth structure. At the same time, given two diffoemorphic manifolds, assuming one of them has some additional structures (e.g., tensor field, differential form, complex structure), then the other manifold also carries corresponding structures induced from the diffeomorphism. To be more specific, let's say $M$ and $N$ are two manifolds that are diffeomorphic ($\phi: M \rightarrow N$) to one another. And, for example, maybe I'm given manifold $M$, but I'd prefer to think about it as $N$ because I'm more comfortable with $N$. My impression is that I can now do anything on $N$ that depends only on the smooth structure - for example, construct differential forms, tensor fields, and vector fields - and, given my diffeomorphism, view these constructions as also existing on $M$. (this is because the tangent and cotangent bundles, and all tensor products of these are also diffeomorphic/isomorphic). e.g. 1) If $h$ is a metric on $N$, $g = h \circ d\phi$ is a metric on $M$. 2) If $J$ is a complex structure on $N$, $J' = d\phi^{-1} \circ J \circ d \phi$ is a complex structure on $M$. 3) If $g$ and $h$ are as from 1), then $\int_N dV_h = \int_M dV_g$. 4) Any curvature at a point $p \in M$ will be equal to the same curvature at the corresponding point $\phi(p)\in N$. Is this correct/does this capture the essence of what it means to be diffeomorphic? Is it even necessary to refer back to $M$? Or in practice once you have a diffeomorphism can you just work on $N$ and the fact that everything carries over to $M$ is obvious/implicit? Are there other or better ways to think about diffeomorphism?","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

2069016,Number of solutions to $x^n=e$ in group $G$ is divisible by $n$,"My question is, can we prove that the number of solutions to $x^n=e$ in group $G$ is divisible by $n$, for $n | |G|$ Apparently the answer is it is indeed true, infact for the equation $x^n = a$ for any $a \in G $ also, however I have had many ideas each of which having a small flaw with them. For example I attempted induction on order of $G$ as follows: Assume true for all groups of order $ \leq k$. Consider $|G| = k+1$. If $G$ is cyclic, we show fairly easily the result holds. (In fact if I recall correctly there are $n$ solutions for each divisor $n$). If $G$ is not cyclic, we can look at the subgroups of $G$. It'd be nice to say the number of solutions in each group is divisible by $n$ by the induction hypothesis and get the desired answer by inclusion-exlusion for solutions in all the subgroups, however we could potentially have a subgroup of order  less than $n$ and still contain a solution. So if we were able to show it works for all the subgroups of orders $ < n$ collectively we would be done. I have no idea whether this can work though. I did see this question The number of solutions of $x^n = e$ in a finite group is a multiple of n, whenever n divides the group order. however I couldn't find much help on it. From the hint given I managed to show $no. solutions = \sum_{ d|n} \lambda_{i} \phi(d)$ for some $\lambda_{i}$s, however they could be different so I can't just use the well know summing of euler-phi formula. Any solution/ideas would be very much appreciated.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2069019,Integration by substitution: follow-up,"This is a follow-up question to the one I ask here .  Gono's answer indicates that the following is true: Suppose that $f:I \to \Bbb R$ is continuous and $\varphi: [a,b] \to I$ is continuously differentiable.

Note, however, that with the example I gave, the $f(\varphi(t))\varphi'(t)$ resulting from my substitution failed to coincide with the integrand $t^4$ over $[-1,1]$.

2069069,How to normalize by volume the density of a set of points distributed within a sphere.,"Suppose we are in $R^3$ and we have a set of points distributed within a sphere of radius $\rho$. I want to have a measure of ""density"" of points in spherical shells of the sphere. To visualize this, I draw a histogram where the $n'th$ point on the x-axis represents the $n'th$ spherical shell, covering some radius $0\leq (r_n \pm\epsilon) \leq \rho$, and the y-axis represents the number of points belonging to the corresponding shell. Of course, this would give me a biased measure of density because shells further away from the center of the sphere have greater volume, hence more points in them, but are not necessarily denser. To remedy that, I divide the number of points in each shell by its volume $\frac{4}{3} \pi (r_2^3-r_1^3)$ where $0\leq r_1 \leq r_2 \leq \rho$ are the radial distances defining the shell. My statistical knowledge is extremely limited, is this a proper/usual method of normalizing in this context? To test this I distributed points uniformly in a sphere and proceeded with this method to normalize the density, and here's some graphs: Measuring the actual number of points per spherical shell:
x-axis spherical shell. y-axis number of points in it Before normalization Now here's the same plot after normalizing as I describe above To somebody inexperienced in dealing with data, like myself, this would mean the method is fine it just needs a lot more shells and a lot more points, and it will converge to a good measure of normalized density (i.e. it will flatten to a line). However, this is for 50,000 points and 500 shells. I ran this for 500,000 points and 1000 shells, it didn't get much better. Perhaps it's a matter of slow convergence, but I do think there seems to be a problem near the origin, as I have observed in the specific problem I'm trying to solve.

2069175,Entire function is polynomial of degree $n$ iff $z^{n}f(1/z) \to \alpha$ as $z \to 0$.,"I am working through old qualifier questions in analysis over break, and I was hoping someone would be willing to help me verify (and correct) my proof for the following statement. I feel fairly confident in the forward side, but less so in the converse. In particular, am I on the right track in reaching for uniform convergence to move the limit inside the series? If not, what tools should I be reaching for instead? Thank you in advance for any help! Theorem: Let $f$ be an entire function. Prove carefully that $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ if and only if there exists $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\lim_{z \to 0} z^{n} f(1/z) = \alpha$. Proof: Suppose first $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$. Then:
$$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k}z^{k}$$ And: $$z^{n}f(1/z) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} z^{n-k}$$ And $z^{n}f(1/z) \to a_{n}$ as $z \to 0$. So $a_{n}$ is our choice of $\alpha$. Conversely, let $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$ and suppose $\lim_{z \to 0} z^{n}f(1/z) = \alpha$. As $f$ is entire, we have that $f$ is equal to its power series representation for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$:
$$f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{k}$$ As $f$ is entire and the Cauchy root test, this power series converges uniformly on $\mathbb{C}$. Now consider:
$$z^{n}f(1/z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{n-k}$$ I show that the power series representation of $z^{n}f(1/z)$ converges uniformly using the Weierstrass $M$-test. Let $r > 0$. We have that for any $z \in B_{r}(0)$ that:
$$\left|\dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{n-k} \right| \leq \left|\dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \right| r^{k}$$ Let $M_{k} := \left|\dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \right| r^{k}$. By the Ratio Test, we see that $\sum M_{k}$ converges absolutely. So by the Weierstrass $M$-test, the power series representation of $z^{n}f(1/z)$ converges uniformly in $B_{r}(0)$. As $r$ was arbitrary, the power series representation of $z^{n}f(1/z)$ converges uniformly everywhere. Thus, we can move the limit inside the series: $$\alpha = \lim_{z \to 0} z^{n} f(1/z) = \lim_{z \to 0} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{n-k} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\lim_{z \to 0} \dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{n-k} \right)  $$ It follows that $\lim_{z \to 0} \dfrac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} z^{n-k} = 0$ whenever $|n-k| < 0$, which implies that $f^{(k)}(0) = 0$ whenever $n-k < 0$. Now when $k = n$, $\lim_{z \to 0} \dfrac{f^{(n)}(0)}{k!} z^{0} = \alpha$. So $f$ is a polynomial of degree $n$ (provided $\alpha \neq 0$). QED.",['complex-analysis']

Before asking the question one needs to explain some facts about this infinite product. Consider these two propositions If $\cos\frac{\pi j}{n+1}+\cosh\alpha_j= \cos\frac{\pi k}{m+1}+\cosh\beta_k=x$ for all integers $1\le j\le n,\ 1\le k\le m$ then $$

\prod_{j=1}^n2\cosh m\alpha_j=\prod_{k=1}^m2\cosh n\beta_k.\tag{2}
$$ The formulas defining $\alpha_j$ and $\beta_k$ arise during solution of Helmholtz equation on a finite rectangular lattice with suitable boundary conditions (see e.g. Phillips, B.; Wiener, N. (1923). Nets and the Dirichlet problem. Journal of Math. and
Physics, Massachusetts Institute, 105–124 ). The proofs of these two identities are elementary in the sense that only elementary trigonometry is involved in the proof. There are also corresponding identities on hexagonal lattices as well. When $m,n\to\infty$ with the ratio $m/n$ fixed they have continous analogues
$$

$$

It is possible to prove these formulas directly by contour integration. Now it turns out that there are other similar identities and in fact an infinite family of them. Here I give only two examples

The formula is I have been thinking about it in terms of Phythagoras' theorem, and since the variables $X, Y,\ldots$ in this formula are independent, they have orthogonal directions.
So in terms of Pythagoras' theorem, I would think that the formula should be $$(\Delta R)^2 = (\Delta X)^2+(\Delta Y)^2 + \cdots$$ I really don't understand where the partial derivatives come from. I have looked at the multivariable chain rule as I read that this formula was based on the multivariable chain rule, however I don't see the link! EDIT ADDED AFTER READING THE ANSWERS 25/12/2016 So it seems to me that my confusion lies in the fact that the variation of $R$ in the orthogonal $x$ and $y$ directions is not just $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ and the orthogonality is needed to use Phythagoras' theorem. I'm not sure if this is a correct way of thinking about this, but perhaps this has to do with the orthogonal 'axes' for this being skewed or not exactly orthogonal in a certesian coordinate system, which is why the partial derivatives are needed to decompose R onto these orthogonal axes? I don't think I'm making much sense, but in a nutshell, could linear algebra and basis sets provide an answer to my question? If so, does anyone know what topics specifically it would be useful to look up/Google search to understand this better?

2069468,Optimal strategy: Two Player Gambling Die Game,"This is a simple 2 player game on which each player has an individual ""pool"" of finite money or points, and every round they must decide how many points they want to risk for a chance to get a directly proportional reward. I've been trying to solve this problem for a while, but I still know very little about game theory and I can't seem to even find the proper place to start. I'd be thankful if anyone could help me. The Game: Two players, A and B, start the game with \$500 each. In every round, a single, 6 faced die is tossed. Both players have to gamble an integer value from \$1 to \$99 (inclusive). If the die shows the number one, both players get their respective bets back and earn 5x the amount they gambled. All earnings are added to the amount available for gambling. If the die rolls any other number, both players lose the amount they gambled. The amount of money remaining for each player is revealed to their opponent at the end of every round. The game ends when one of the players has no money left, or after 1000 rounds. The winner is the player with the most money. Example: Round 1 begins Player A bets \$1, Player B bets \$2 Die rolls a 5 Player A now has \$499, Player B now has \$498 Round 1 ends Round 2 begins Player A bets \$1, Player B bets \$2 Die rolls a 1 Player A gets his \$1 back, plus another \$5. He now
has \$504. Player B gets her \$2 back, plus another \$10. She now has
\$508. Round 2 ends What is the best strategy the players can play to win the game? Any help is appreciated.","['game-theory', 'probability']"
2069481,Calculate return on investment (ROI),"Before coming to the question, I'll quickly explain how to calculate NPV (Net present value) with an example Information Available Equipment Cost - \$20,000 Annual Benefit - \$6,000 Scrap Value - \$2,000 Years in Service ($n$) - 4 Years Inflation Rate/Interest Rate ($r$) - 7% What is NPV Net Present Value is the amount of money we'll have from our investment in a particular product during the course of it's service. We calculate first the Present Value (PV) by $$\textrm{PV} = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\left(\frac{\textrm{Annual Benefit}}{(1+r)^k}\right)\quad + \quad \frac{\textrm{Annual Benefit}+\textrm{Scrap Value}}{(1+r)^n}$$ that is, the present value of each annual benefit over the lifetime, plus the present value of the final year benefit. For Final Year, we add the scrap value to annual benefit as well. For this case the values we get are Y1 = \$5,607 Y2 = \$5,240 Y3 = \$4,897 Y4 = \$6,103 Add them all together we get \$21,849. So at the end of 4 years we made \$21,849 on an investment of \$20000 in terms of today's money. $$\textrm{NPV} = 21,849 - 20,000 = \textbf{\$1,849}$$ ROI Now ROI is the value of r (Interest Rate) at which NPV comes out to be 0. At a certain value of r (for this case it's 11%), when you run the formula 4 times (for four years), the four values add up to 20,000 (the initial investment) Can you calculate it  with a formula?

2069504,A Banach space has an absolutely convergent basis $\iff$ it is topologically isomorphic to $\ell^1$,"$X$: Banach space. Then, $X$ has an absolutely convergent basis $\{x_n\}$ $\iff$ $X$ is tolopogically isomorphic to $\ell^1$ This is Exercise 4.14 in A Basis Theory Primer, Christopher Heil. I am just reading this book and not a homework. Proof: $(\implies)$ Let $\{x_n\}$ be an absolutely convergent basis for $X$. Let $T\colon \ell^1\to X$ be defined by $$y\mapsto Ty:=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{y_n}{\|x_n\|_X}x_n,$$ for $y=(y_n)\in\ell^1$. We show that $T$ is linear continuous and $\mathrm{range}(T)=X$. Then, as a consequence of the Open Mapping Theorem the assertion will follow. (linearity) Take $y^{(1)},y^{(2)}\in\ell^1$ arbitrarily. Let $P_Ny:=(y_1,\dotsc,y_n,0,0,\dotsc)$. Then, 
we have $\alpha_N:=T(P_Ny^{(1)}+P_Ny^{(2)})=T(P_Ny^{(1)})+T(P_Ny^{(2)})$, but it is easy to check both $T(y^{(1)}+y^{(2)})$ and $T(y^{(1)})+T(y^{(2)})$ are the limit of $\alpha_N$, and thus, checking the scaler multiplication similarly, the linearity follows. (continuity) We have $\|Ty\|_X\le \sum_{n=1}^\infty |y_n|\cdot1=\|y_n\|_{\ell^1}$. (onto) Let $x\in X$. Since $\{x_n\}$ is an absolutely convergent basis, we have the representation $x=\sum_{n}a_n(x)x_n$ with a coefficient functional $a_n$ such that $\sum_{n}|a_n(x)|\|x_n\|<\infty$. Letting $y_n:=a_n(x)\|x_n\|$ we have $y\in \ell^1$ and $Ty=x$. ($\impliedby$) With the standard basis $\{\delta_n\}$ where only the $n$-th component of $\delta_n=(0,\dotsc,0,1,0,\dotsc)$ is non-zero, clearly $y=\sum_{n}\delta_ny_n\in\ell^1$ is absolutely convergent, i.e., $\{\delta_n\}$ is an absolutely convergent basis. Let $\mathcal{T}\colon\ell^1\to X$ be an homeomorphism, and let $x_n:=\mathcal{T}y_n$. Then, $\{x_n\}$ is a basis (Lemma 4.18, Heil's book). Since $\mathcal{T}^{-1}x\in\ell^1$, because $\delta_n$ is a basis there exist a unique scalars such that $\mathcal{T}^{-1}x=\sum_n c_n \delta_n\in \ell^1$. Since $\delta_n$ is an absolutely convergent basis with $\|\delta_n\|=1$ we have $\sum_n|c_n|<\infty$.  From the continuity of $\mathcal{T}$ we have
$$
x=\sum_n{c_n}\mathcal{T}\delta_n=\sum_n{c_n}x_n.
$$
But 
$$\sum_n|{c_n}|\|\mathcal{T}\delta_n\|\le \sup_{y\in\ell^1\, \|y\|=1}\|\mathcal{T}y\|\sum_n|{c_n}|<\infty,$$
and thus indeed $\{x_n\}$ is an absolutely convergent basis. I think the proof is alright, but what I don't really like about it is that I used Lemma 4.18 (p.140), which appears after Exercise 4.14 (p.139) in the book. 
I don't think ""I wonder if I could show this just by using knowledge prior to Exercise 4.14"" is a good way of asking a question, as the book isn't available to everybody even though it is what I wish to ask. So, I wonder if I could show this using, results from Section 2, say Heil, Contents (pdf) where results from  elementary functional analysis are introduced.","['alternative-proof', 'proof-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'schauder-basis', 'analysis']"

At every step, we choose a random pair $(i,j)$ with $i<j$ and copy the $i$-th color into the $j$-th position. For example, if the state is $BWW$ and we choose $(1,3)$, then the next state would be $BWB$. Starting with an initial state $BWW\ldots W$, we will reach a final state $BB\ldots B$ in finite time with probability $1$ (because any initial segment of blacks persists forever).

I listed below my attempt to validate the statement in the title with an example.  I'd appreciate it if someone can confirm it or correct me. For simplicity (WLOG), pick the real number '$2$'.  We construct a subsequence $\{s_{n_k}\}$ converging to '$2$' as follows: Pick $s_{n_1}=1.$ Pick $s_{n_2}\in [2-\frac{1}{2}, 2]$, with $n_2>n_1$.  (This is feasible because there are infinitely many rationals in $[2-\frac{1}{2}, 2]$.) Similarly, pick $s_{n_3}\in[2-\frac1{3},2].$  (Note that $s_{n_3}$ need not be greater than $s_{n_2}$.) Continue this process ($s_{n_k}\in [2-\frac1{k},2]$) to construct the rest of $\{s_{n_k}\}$ for $k=4, 5, 6,...$ Is this a valid example to show that the order of the rationals in $\{s_n\}$ doesn't matter and that every real number must be a subsequential limit of $\{s_n\}$?

My attempt so far: For any test function $\phi \in C_0^\infty((0,

So, $$\left|\langle u, \phi\rangle\right| \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N+1} \left|\partial^k \phi(1/k)\right|.$$ Using that estimate it is not hard to show that $u \in \mathscr{D}((0, \infty))$.  Suppose $v$ is a distribution on $\mathbb{R}$ that restricts to $u$ on $(0,
\infty)$.  Let $\rho$ be a test function identically equal to 1 on $[-1, 1]$ and support in a small neighborhood of that set. For all $n$, let $\mathbb{O_n} = \{(-2, \frac{1}{n-1}), (\frac{1}{n}, 2)\}$ and let $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ be the partition of unity of $supp(\rho e^x)$ with respect to $\mathbb{O_n}$.  Then

Suppose we cut up the sphere in spherical shells of uniform thickness $\Delta r=r_n-r_{n-1}$. I want to find the density of points in each spherical shell. Since outer shells are larger than inner shells, a proper measure of density would have to be somehow normalized. The straightforward answer would be to divide the number of points in each spherical shell by its volume, $\frac{4}{3}\pi (r_n^3 - r_{n-1}^3)$ and that would give a normalized density. Here's some plots. X-axis: radial distance from center of sphere. Y-axis: number of points in corresponding spherical shell This is density before normalizing for volume: This is density after normalizing for volume: Perhaps, refining this process will give a straight line for the normalized density and indeed this is the correct way of measuring what I want. However, taking alot more points and cutting up the sphere in much finer partitions, the results don't get drastically better. Perhaps it's an instance of slow convergence. But perhaps this method really has trouble as you approach the origin. Any ideas?

I'm asked to find $ \Phi^*\omega $. Moreover, if $p=\left(1, \frac\pi2\right), v=(1,0)$ and $w=(3,1)$, I must compute $(\Phi^*\omega )_p(v, w)$. At first, it is straightforward to find out that $\Phi^*\omega =r\,dr\wedge d\theta$, I don't have any problem at this point. (This is what everyone learns to do effortlesstly) On the other side, one learns that $(\Phi^*\omega )_p(v, w):=\omega_{\Phi(p)}\big(d\Phi_p(v), d\Phi_p(w)\big)$. Also, 
$$d\Phi_p(v)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial \Phi_1}{\partial r}(p) & \frac{\partial \Phi_1}{\partial \theta}(p)  \\ \frac{\partial \Phi_2}{\partial r}(p) &  \frac{\partial \Phi_2}{\partial \theta}(p)\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} =\cdots = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1& 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.$$

Definition (Binary Operation): A binary operation , on a set $G$ is a function $$\star  : G \times G \to G$$ Definition (Group): A group , is an ordered pair $(G, \star)$ where $G$ is set, and $\star$ is a binary operation on $G$ satisfying the following axioms $(a \star b) \star c = a \star (b \star c) \forall a, b, c \in G $ $\exists e \in G$ (called an identity of $G$ ) such that $a \star e = e \star a = a \forall a \in G$ For each $a \in G$ , there is an $a^{-1}$ in $G$ (called an inverse of $a$ ) such that $a \star a^{-1} = a^{-1} \star a = e$ If for some $a, b \in G$ , $\not\exists \  c \in G$ such that $a \star b = c$ . Is $(G, \star)$ still a group? I know that to verify that $(G, \star)$ is a group all we need to do is check the axioms for a group and verify that the necessary properties (of which closure is not one), hold, which leads me to believe that $(G, \star)$ is indeed a group, even though it's not closed under $\star$ . But perhaps more importantly, I can't see why one would define a group in this way (apart from it being obviously more general). I can't see the motivation for closure to not be an axiom for a group (again apart from generality). As must of us know from the Vector Space axioms, that $V$ is a vector space only if it is closed under both addition and multiplication, which is where this question sprung about. Even more generally is there any reason apart from generality, as to why some mathematical structures have an axiom for closure under a binary operation (e.g. addition/multiplication etc.) and others don't?","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'definition']"

In particular, the plane, the cylindre, the surfaces of revolution (circular cone, sphere, torus...), the helicoid. The sliding motion can be a combination of translation and rotation. I want to know if there is some theory about these, and in particular if they have a name, if there are others than those I listed and if they can be characterized by some property of their principal curvatures. (I guess that at least one of them must be constant.) Update : If I am right, those surfaces are obtained by sweeping an arbitrary curve with a constant rigid motion, one of translation, rotation about an axis or ""screw displacement"". Then during surface motion, every point follows a straight line, a circular arc or an helix. Using cylindrical coordinates $(r,\theta,z)$, where the $z$ axis is that of the helix, and using the parametric equation of the section curve of the surface by the plane $xz$, $(r(u),0,z(u))$, the equation of the swept surface is $$(r(u),v,z(u)+\sigma v)$$ where $\sigma$ is the pitch. In Cartesian coordinates, $$(r(u)\cos v,r(u)\sin v,z(u)+\sigma v).$$ Then the first fundamental form is $$\begin{align}E&=r'^2(u)+z'^2(u),\\F&=\sigma z'(u),\\G&=r^2(u)+\sigma^2.\end{align}$$ The normal vector, $$\frac1{\sqrt{\sigma^2r'^2(u)+z^2(u)r^2(u)+r^2(u)r'^2(u)}}\\(\sigma r'(u)\sin v-z'(u)r(u)\cos v,-\sigma r'(u)\cos v-z'(u)r(u)\sin v,r(u)r'(u)).$$ And the second fundamental form, $$\begin{align}
L&=-z'(u)r(u)r''(u)-\sigma r'(u)r''(u)+r(u)r'(u)z'(u),\\

2070129,Completeness of $\ell^2$ done right,"One of our problem sets this quarter in analysis asked us to show that $\ell^2$, the set of all square-summable sequences, is complete. At the time, I struggled to prove this, but I have an idea after reading on in Rudin's Principles . My idea is to use uniform convergence of a sequence of continuous functions and change the order of limits. Please let me know what I need to make the following go through; I have seen many questions here on StackExchange, similar to this, where the answerer skirts the question of this exchange of limits, and I would like if someone could just answer with as many epsilons as needed to get the thing settled once and for all. We have shown that $\ell^2$ is an inner-product space, and it has a norm $\lVert \mathbf x\rVert^2 = \sum_{n\ge 1} x_n^2$. One step of the process is to come up with a candidate limit for a Cauchy sequence, and we can do this fairly easily. Let $(\mathbf x_n)$ be a Cauchy sequence in $\ell^2$ with $\mathbf x_n = x_{n,1},x_{n,2},x_{n,3},\dotsc$. We can arrange the sequences $\mathbf x_n$ into an infinite square matrix $(x_{i,j})$, and show without much trouble that for a fixed $j\in \mathbf N$ the sequence $(x_{i,j})_{i\in\mathbf N}$ is Cauchy (the columns of the infinite array are themselves Cauchy). For each fixed $j\in \mathbf N$, and with $m,n$ sufficiently large, $|x_{n,j}-x_{m,j}|\le\lVert \mathbf x_n-\mathbf x_m\rVert < \varepsilon$, since $(\mathbf x_n)$ is Cauchy. Since $\mathbf R$ is complete, put $y_j = \lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n,j}$. We claim that $\mathbf y = y_1,y_2,y_3,\dotsc$ is in $\ell^2$ and $\mathbf x_n\to \mathbf y$. By the reverse-triangle inequality, for sufficiently large $m,n\in\mathbf N$, $|\lVert \mathbf x_n\rVert-\lVert\mathbf x_m\rVert| \le \lVert \mathbf x_n-\mathbf x_m\rVert < 1$ by the Cauchy criterion, so that since $\lVert \mathbf x_m\rVert = C < \infty$, we have $\lim_{n\to\infty}\lVert \mathbf x_n\rVert \le C + 1 < \infty$. We want to show that $\sum_{j=1}^\infty y_j^2 < \infty$, and here is how I want to do that. For each $n=1,2,\dotsc$, put $f_n:\mathbf N\to \mathbf R$ to be the function $f_n(k) = \sum_{j=1}^kx_{n,j}^2$. Every function from $\mathbf N$ to $\mathbf R$ is continuous, so $(f_n)$ is a sequence of continuous functions. Now, $\sum_{j=1}^\infty y_j^2 = \lim_{k\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{j=1}^kx_{n,j}^2 = \lim_{k\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}f_n(k)$. If only I could interchange these limits, then I would have $\sum_{j=1}^\infty y_j^2 = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{j=1}^\infty x_{n,j}^2 = \lim_{n\to\infty}\lVert \mathbf x_n\rVert^2 < \infty$, as we already saw. My thoughts are that, as $k\to\infty$, $f_n(k)\to \lVert \mathbf x_n\rVert^2$, and as $n\to\infty, f_n(k)\to\sum_{j=1}^ky_j^2$, and that this latter convergence is uniform (we are dealing with a finite sum, so the uniform convergence shouldn't be hard to demonstrate is my gut reaction). Thus, if we put $f(k) = \sum_{j=1}^k y_j^2$, then $f_n\to f$ uniformly on $\mathbf N$, so we can exchange the order of the limits, just like in Rudin's theorem 7.11. I am not sure if this is correct—particularly the part where I am asserting $f_n\to f$ uniformly on $\mathbf N$. If anyone could help straighten this out, I'd be much obliged. Edit I am aware that this isn't all that has to be said to justify completeness. My main question is the rigorous justification of switching limits.","['real-analysis', 'proof-verification']"

Using the definition of Lebuesgue measure. let's order $\mathbb{Q}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}\left\{ r_{i}\right\} $. For given

for any $\delta>0$, there exists $b\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $|a-b|<\delta$ (by

Then $f([a,b]) = [c, d]$ where $c \leq d$. Two questions: $(1)$ Why isn't this combination more common? $(2)$ Can we prove this in one go (ie., without first proving the IVT and EVT and deducing this as a corollary)? From the perspective of topology, this theorem follows from the fact that the continuous image of a connected and compact space is connected and compact. I'm looking for a ""calculus"" style proof (ie., using an $\epsilon-\delta$ argument, least upper bound property and/or sequences).","['continuity', 'real-analysis', 'calculus']"

2070433,"What information does a group extension Ext$^1(X,Y)$ convey?","I am struggling to understand exactly what a group extension is (Hartshorne is quite abstract for me). Studying vector bundles I encounter the following problem: Let $X = P^1 ×P^1$ over the complex number be a quadric surface. We denote by $l$ and $m$ the standard basis of Pic$(X)=Z^2$. So, the canonical class $K_X =−2l−2m$ and $l^2=m^2=0$ and $lm=1$. Let $E$ be a rank 2 vector bundle on $X$ given by a non-trivial extension $e\neq 0$:
$$
0 \to O_X(l-3m) \to E \to O_X(3m) \to 0
$$
and apparently this extension exists because 
$$ 
\text{Ext}^1(O_X(3m), O_X(l-3m)) \cong H^1(X,O_X(l-6m)) \cong \mathbb{C}^{10}
$$
My question is is there a way to understand intuitively what information this group extension conveys? From the short exact sequence I know that gives the information that $O_X(l-3m) \backsimeq \frac{E}{O_X(3m)}$ but I do not know what else is hidden there. How can I quickly compute $c_1(E)$ and $c_2(E)$? And how does this extension actually change $E$?","['abelian-groups', 'vector-bundles', 'sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

It is actually a part of this whole question: If $S_n = (3+\sqrt{5})^n + (3-\sqrt{5})^n$, show that $S_n$ is an integer and that  $S_{n+1} = 6S_n - 4S_{n-1}$.
Deduce that the next integer greater than $(3+\sqrt{5})^n$ is divisible by $2^n$. I could do the first two parts. The first part I have done by induction and the second part by simply using the given formula. I cannot proceed at all in the third part. I think it may need induction. Please give any solutions regarding the third one and see whether the second one can be proved using induction.","['algebra-precalculus', 'induction']"

$a_n:=\frac{n^{3n}}{n3^n}$ I have done it using the ratio test for limits as I will illustrate below, but I feel like there is an easier method but cannot find one; it would sate my curiosity to see it done in less lines: Let $a_{n+1}:=\frac{(n+1)^{3n+3}}{(n+1)3^{n+1}}$ $$\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{(n+1)^{3n+3}}{(n+1)3^{n+1}}\times\frac{n3^n}{n^{3n}}=\frac{n}{3}(n+1)^2(1+\frac{1}{n})^{3n}\ge \frac{n}{3}(n+1)$$ We are utilising the comparison test to observe that $\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$ is greater than a sequence which clearly tends to infinity, and thus by the ratio test $lim\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}>1$ as n tends to infinity, so the limit of $a_n=+\infty$ as $n \rightarrow+\infty$ Could anyone provide a shorter method which doesn't use the ratio test maybe?

2070494,"The divisibility of a particular case of $\binom{x}{y}$ (when $(x,y) = 1$) [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : The binomial coefficient $n\choose m$ is divisible by $n/\gcd(n,m)$ (2 answers) Closed 7 years ago . Suppose $x + 2y = k$ where $k$ is prime and $x > y > 0$. Prove that $x|\binom{x}{y}$. That is, prove that $\binom{x}{y}$ is divisible by $x$. The only leads I have are that, since $x$ and $y$ must be relatively prime -- or else $k$ would not be prime -- in the expansion of the binomial coefficient: $$\frac{(x)(x-1)\dots(x-y+1)}{(y)(y-1)\dots 1}$$, there is necessarily some value in $\{x-1 \dots x-y+1\}$ that is divisible by $y$. This is true, because given any consecutive $y$ numbers, at least one must be divisible $y$, and we know that $x$ is not that number. Edit: Apparently this is answered here When is $\binom{n}{k}$ divisible by $n$? I'm not seeing how the result is obvious, however, for the particular case that $(n,k) = 1$.","['combinatorics', 'elementary-number-theory']"
