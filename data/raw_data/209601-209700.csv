4208196,Which space do we obtain if we take a Möbius strip and identify its boundary circle to a point?,"I know that the boundary circle of a Möbius strip is actually formed by the horizontal sides of $[0 ,1] \times [0,1]$ .If we identify all the points of the 1st horizontal side to a single point and do the same for the second horizontal side we get a disc with the antipodal points identified to itself(which is $\mathbb{RP}^2$ ). However I am not sure of how to write it down rigorously. $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
    Mobius strip  @>i(x)>> [0,1] \times[0,1] @>g(x)>> D  @>f(x)>> D/\sim_1\\
     @VV\pi(x) = cl(x)V \\
    Mobius Strip / \sim  \\
\end{CD} where $\sim$ denotes identifying the boundary cirlce  of a Mobius strip and $\sim_1$ denotes identifying the opposite points of the disc. I am not sure of what $g(x)$ is ? or the fact that mobius strip will be compact or the composition of $f \circ g \circ i(x)$ will be onto? Any other method will be appreciated but I wanted to know whether the mobius strip is compact?","['non-orientable-surfaces', 'general-topology', 'mobius-band']"
4208197,Conjugacy classes of finite group G having size at most 4 implies G is solvable.,"I am stuck on the following question and am looking for help/ hints: Question: Show that if the conjugacy classes of a finite group $G$ have size at most 4, then $G$ is solvable. (I have not been able to find anything on stackexchange that is the same or a similar question). Context : This is a past paper question for an algebra preliminary exam I am studying for, not a homework question. Apologies if this is still against the rules. The sequence associated with the exam uses Dummit-Foote as the main textbook to give some idea of the level the questions are aimed at: I have not taken the sequence and did not learn solvable groups (or composition/ normal series) in undergrad, but have read the relevant parts of Dummit-Foote and Aluffi's Chapter 0 and tried some problems from there (I much prefer the style of exposition in the latter). So I'm quite new to the topic of solvable groups and not at all comfortable/ proficient with it yet. My thoughts/ attempt : I have mostly been trying to work with the derived series definition, as I didn't get very far with trying to come up with an abelian/ cyclic series for $G$ . I've showed that conjugacy classes are identified in the abelianization, but this just gives me that $|G/[G,G]| \leq$ (number of conjugacy classes of $G$ ), but the hypothesis of the question just implies that the number of conjucagy classes is at least $|G|/4$ , which is unhelpful. Abelian groups are solvable but they are their abelianization, so the only a priori bound on the number of conjugacy classes is $|G|$ , so I don't think this approach has gotten me anywhere. I am mainly stuck on firstly which characterisation of solvable groups to use, and secondly how to use the bound given in the hypothesis of the question.  I also noted that the hypothesis can be restated as: $ [ G \colon C_{G}(g) ] \leq 4 $ for any $ g \in G $ . But $C_{G}(g)$ is not a normal subgroup a priori so I can't quotient by it (it would be if its index were bounded by 2, however). Apologies for the length, this is my first post and I wanted to provide context for my level and the level the question is aimed at, as well as showing that I've thought and attempted the question (but am quite lost at the moment). I tried to follow the guidelines for asking questions as much as possible. For questions on solvable groups I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the different approaches one can take: derived series terminating in the identity, showing $G$ has a cyclic (or merely abelian) series, finding a solvable normal subgroup $N$ such that $G/N$ is solvable... and I always find it hard to see which approach will be most viable when starting out on a problem. At this stage I would appreciate hints etc. to point me in the right direction and get me unstuck, and not a full answer, as working out some of it on my own would be more beneficial to me. EDIT : Thanks to the helpful hint from @DerekHolt I've managed to work out the solution so will now accept answers (if none come I will type one up when I have time) so that this can be marked as answered.","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'finite-groups', 'solvable-groups']"
4208222,Fenchel Dual of indicator function,"It is well known that if I have the indicator function $$\iota_S(x)=\cases{ 0 \text{ if } x \in S \\ +\infty \text{ else} }$$ of a convex set $S$ , then this is a convex functional and its Fenchel dual is the support function $$\sigma_S(y) = \sup_{x\in S} \langle y,x \rangle .$$ One can then use this in convex optimisations problems to find the dual of the problem itself. So, if I have $$\min_{x\in C} \psi(x) \text{ s.t.} Ax=b,$$ then I can rewrite the problem as $\min_x \psi(x) + \iota_C(x) + \iota_S(Ax)$ , where $\iota_s(x) = \cases {0 \text{ if } x = b,\\ +\infty \text{ else}}$ and compute the dual of my problem, using Fenchel-Rockafeller duality as $\sup_y -\sigma_S(-y) - (\psi+\iota_c)^\star(A^\star y).$ In this simple case, it's easy to see that $-\sigma_S(-y)= \inf_{x\in S} \langle y,x \rangle = \langle y,b \rangle $ (as $x \in S \iff x = b$ ). My question then is: what happens if $S$ , instead of being $S=\{ x : x = b\}$ is a set denoting inequality constraints? For instance, $S=\{ x: x \geq \gamma\}$ ? Is there a standard/straight-forward way of characteristing the Fenchel dual? More precisely, if I have a problem $\min_{x\in C} \psi(x) \text{ s.t } Ax \geq \gamma$ what would the dual be? If our space were the space of Radon Measures and $A$ were a linear operator (say, the integral of the measure with respect to a fixed measurable function $g$ ) how would the constraint that $\int dQ g \geq \gamma$ impact the dual? Intuitively, the new $-\sigma_S(-u)$ would be $\inf_{Q\in S} \int u dQ$ . If $u=g$ then clearly this infimum can be $\gamma$ , otherwise it is $-\infty$ . But, how do I reason about all the possible measures and functionals I can plug in this infimum?
If $u = \lambda g$ with $\lambda >0$ , is it then true that $\inf_{Q\in S}\int u dQ = \inf_{\lambda>0} \lambda \gamma$ ? Is it arbitrarily small then? What about other (non-linear) transformations of $g$ ?

4208234,On the 'wrong proof' of the chain rule,"I am looking through an old analysis course that I had and I was pondering a bit about the proof of chain rule (especially the notorious wrong proof that you can give). I'd be happy if someone was willing to verify my reasoning below. I end with an actual question. Let's start with the following nice result. Let $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function which is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}_0$ . Assume that $\lim_{x\to 0}f'(x)=L\in \mathbb{R}$ . Then $f$ is differentiable in $0$ . Proof: For each $h\neq 0$ , the mean value theorem yields a $c_h\in \mathbb{R}$ strictly between $h$ and $0$ such that $f'(c_h)=\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}$ . Letting $h\to 0$ , is it is obvious that $c_h\to 0$ as each $|c_h|<|h|$ . Hence $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}f'(c_h)=L.$$ $\square$ Great, let's apply this to the following function: $$\phi\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}:x\mapsto \begin{cases}x^3\sin(\frac{1}{x}) & \mbox{ if }x\neq 0,\\0 & \mbox{ if } x=0.\end{cases}$$ Clearly $\phi$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}_0$ and $$\phi'(x)=3x^2\sin(\frac{1}{x})-x^3\cos(\frac{1}{x})\frac{1}{x^2}=3x^2\sin(\frac{1}{x})-x\cos(\frac{1}{x})$$ for all $x\neq 0$ .
It is straightforward to see that $\lim_{x\to 0}\phi'(x)=0$ and thus the above result yields that $\phi'(0)=0$ (in particular $\phi$ is differentiable on the whole of $\mathbb{R}$ ). Now at this point, recall the chain rule. Let $f,g\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be functions. If $a\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f'(a)$ and $g'(f(a))$ both exist, then $(g\circ f)'(a)=g'(f(a))f'(a)$ . The obvious argument to try is the following 'wrong proof': \begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{x-a} &=& \lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{f(x)-f(a)}\cdot \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\\
&=& \lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{f(x)-f(a)}\cdot \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\\
&=& g'(f(a))f'(a).
\end{eqnarray} Here we used that $f$ is continuous in $a$ to see that $f(x)\to f(a)$ as $x\to a$ . $\triangle$ However, there is an obvious error in the above reasoning. If for example $f$ is a constant function $f(x)=f(a)$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$ , then $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{f(x)-f(a)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{0}$ is nonsensical! Having said that, it is also clear that the above proof does work for functions such that $\exists \delta>0:\forall x\in (a-\delta,a+\delta)\setminus \{a\}:f(x)\neq f(a)$ . In that case, $f(x)$ does not equal $f(a)$ for $x$ near $a$ (and $x\neq a$ ). So the above proof only fails for a particular type of function, the easiest of which are constant functions. However, for a constant function $f$ , one can calculate $(g\circ f')(a)$ directly and show that it's $0$ . A natural question at this point is to wonder whether there exists a nonconstant function $f$ such that $f$ is differentiable in $a$ and $f(x)=f(a)$ infinitely often for $x$ near $a$ . The answer is yes and the function $\phi$ given in the example above (with $a=0$ ) satisfies these properties. (Also, the wikipedia page of the chain rule gives the function $f(x)=x^2\sin(\frac{1}{x})$ for $x\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$ as an example, but this function is not differentiable in $0$ . As far as I can tell, this is a worse example than just a constant function to pinpoint the failure of the 'wrong proof'. Perhaps this should be changed?) In general let $f$ be such a function (thus $\forall \delta>0:\exists x\neq a: |x-a|<\delta$ and $f(x)=f(a)$ ). If $\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{x-a}$ exists , then we can compute this limit by choosing an appropriate sequence $x_n\to a$ . For each $n\geq 1$ , there exists an $x_n\neq a$ such that $|x_n-a|<\frac{1}{n}$ and $f(x_n)=f(a)$ . It follows that \begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{x\to a}\frac{g\circ f(x)-g\circ f(a)}{x-a}&=&\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{g\circ f(x_n)-g\circ f(a)}{x_n-a}\\
&=& \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{g\circ f(a)-g\circ f(a)}{x-a}\\
&=& 0.
\end{eqnarray} This shows that if $f$ is a function for which the 'wrong proof' of the chain rule fails, then $(g\circ f)'(a)=0$ . Off course, I was only able to show this under the assumption that $(g\circ f)'(a)$ actually exists (which off course is true as one can actually prove the chain rule). Nonetheless, this begs the question whether there is a more direct way of showing that $(g\circ f)'(a)$ actually exists (and equals zero) if $f$ is a function for which the 'wrong proof' fails. If so, one can actually fix this 'wrong proof' by considering two cases.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'solution-verification', 'derivatives', 'chain-rule']"

4208327,Sparse PCA vs Orthogonal Matching Pursuit,"Can't wrap my head around the difference between Sparse PCA and OMP.
Both try to find a sparse linear combination. Of course, the optimization criteria is different. In Sparse PCA we have: \begin{aligned} \max & x^{T} \Sigma x \\ \text { subject to } &\|x\|_{2}=1 \\ &\|x\|_{0} \leq k \end{aligned} In OMP we have: $$
\min _{x}\|f-D x\|_{2}^{2} \text { subject to }\|x\|_{0} \leq k
$$ Even though these are different, they resemble one another in my eyes.
I'll explain: In PCA we wish to take the projection that counts for the most variance.
If we add the ""sparsity"" constraint, than we regularize and get some projection which is sparser, but does not account for the most variance possible (without the constraint). In OMP (the algorithm procedure here ), we pretty much do the same thing, iteratively - we find the ""atom"" that gives the largest inner product - which is the most correlative. Differences I see: Different optimization problem (already said) - however the ""applicative"" view look very similar, therefore I ask this question OMP is an iterative (greedy) procedure, while in Sparse PCA, there are direct solutions? Moreover,
how about this minor modification: we assume that $f$ is ""taken out"" of $D$ (which applicatively mean that we include 𝑓 to our sparse vectors) - now we have a ""basis"" $D$ , where the OMP result will give us the ""best"" sparse approximation (variance-wise) of $f$ , which resembles PCA on the covariance matrix, no? Example : $D$ is our data (samples and features). In SPCA we find the projections that count for the most variance of the data (done by defining $\Sigma=DD^T$ and applying the Sparse PCA). In OMP we do something similar, we ""take"" one sample, $f$ , ""out"" of matrix $D$ , and try to approximate it with the other samples.
This ""forces"" us to ""use"" $f$ as an atom (with coef = $1.0$ ), but eventually we will get $y = f - D'x' $ with minimum variance, which translates to $Dx$ where there is coefficient $1.0$ in the row of the sample.

4208474,Asymptotic behaviour of transformed Schwartz functions,"Given two Schwartz functions $f, g$ , I consider the following simultaneous transform of them: $$\Lambda_{f,g}(\lambda) := \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dx f(x) g(x) e^{i\sinh(x+\lambda)}.$$ Of course, the product of Schwartz functions is still Schwartz so I could consider just a single function here, however I keep it this was for my attempt at the problem.
What I would like to show is a Riemann-Lebesgue type property: $$\lim_{\lambda \to \pm \infty} \Lambda_{f,g}(\lambda) = 0.$$ Due to the presence of the $\sinh$ term in the exponential, the usual arguments for proving Riemann-Lebesgue don't seem to be useable here as I cannot seem to find a primitive for $e^{i\sinh(x-\lambda)}$ . My attempt to show this was to apply a hyperbolic trig identity, then split the integral into two using a delta distribution: $$\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dx f(x) g(x) e^{i\sinh(x+\lambda)} = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dx dy f(x)e^{i\cosh(\lambda)\sinh(x)} g(y) e^{i\sinh(\lambda)\cosh(y)} \delta(x-y)$$ Then I apply a substitution: $$= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dx dy \frac{f(x)}{\cosh(x)} \cosh(x)e^{i\cosh(\lambda)\sinh(x)} \frac{g(y)}{\sinh(y)}\sinh(y) e^{i\sinh(\lambda)\cosh(y)} \delta(x-y) \\= 2\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}\int^{\infty}_{0}dx dy\frac{f(x)}{\cosh(\sinh^{-1}(x))}e^{i\cosh(\lambda)x} \frac{g(y)}{\sinh(\cosh^{-1}(y))}e^{i\sinh(\lambda)y} \delta(\cosh^{-1}(x) -\sinh^{-1}(y))$$ Now the ""altered"" test functions $\frac{f(x)}{\cosh(\sinh^{-1}(x))}$ and $\frac{g(y)}{\sinh(\cosh^{-1}(y))}$ are still Schwartz as the denominator contributions are only polynomial. From here, I was hoping to apply a Riemann-Lebesgue type argument to the integral over x to show the final integrals vanishes asymptotically in $\lambda$ , but I'm not convinced due to the presence of the delta distribution. Does this argument work? Any other possible directions of investigation to show this, other than what I have attempted, is also welcome.","['complex-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis']"
4208480,"Does ""probability distribution"" refer to the PDF or CDF","In my work and studies, I keep coming across statements that are similar to the following: Quote from one source: A better angle, at least from the perspective of GANs, is to define similarity in
the sense of probability distribution. Two data sets are considered similar if they
are samples from the same (or approximately same) probability distribution. Thus
more specifically we have our training data set X ⊂Rn consisting of samples from a
probability distribution μ (with density p(x)), and we would like to find a probability
distribution ν (with density q(x)) such that ν is a good approximation of μ. By taking
samples from the distribution ν we obtain generated objects that are “similar” to the
objects in X. Quote from a different source: The graph of a continuous probability distribution is a curve. Probability is represented by area under the curve. We have already met this concept when we developed relative frequencies with histograms in Chapter 2. The relative area for a range of values was the probability of drawing at random an observation in that group. Again with the Poisson distribution in Chapter 4, the graph in Example 4.14 used boxes to represent the probability of specific values of the random variable. In this case, we were being a bit casual because the random variables of a Poisson distribution are discrete, whole numbers, and a box has width. Notice that the horizontal axis, the random variable x, purposefully did not mark the points along the axis. The probability of a specific value of a continuous random variable will be zero because the area under a point is zero. Probability is area. The curve is called the probability density function (abbreviated as pdf). We use the symbol f(x) to represent the curve. f(x) is the function that corresponds to the graph; we use the density function f(x) to draw the graph of the probability distribution. I have been trying to really understand at more than a surface level the mathematics behind generative models, but a roadblock has been trying to determine what authors mean by ""probability distribution"". I am fairly certain that ""probability distribution"" in the first quote is referring to the CDF, since the author specifically denotes the density as p(x), which I think refers to the PDF. In the second quote, the author portrays ""the curve"" is a probability distribution, and taking an integral over it results in a probability, obviously conveying it is the PDF. Maybe ""probability distribution"" in fact has no concrete definition and the reader is left to figure out what it is referring to themselves, but it would make my life a lot easier if I knew it referred to one or the other.","['measure-theory', 'statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

Since $|x-y|^2=|x|^2-2 x\cdot y+|y|^2$ then $$I_{\alpha}(x)= \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\frac{e^{-|x-y|^2}}{|y|^{\alpha}}dy=e^{-|x|^2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\frac{e^{-2 x\cdot y+|y|^2}}{|y|^{\alpha}}dy.$$ Using spherical coordinates, we get $$I_{\alpha}(x)= e^{-|x|^2}\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}
\int_{0}^{\infty}
e^{-2 x\cdot \omega r+r^2}r^{n-1-\alpha}dr d\sigma(\omega).$$ By Fubini's theorem we have $$I_{\alpha}(x)= e^{-|x|^2}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}
e^{-2 x\cdot \omega r} d\sigma(\omega)
e^{-r^2}r^{n-1-\alpha}dr.$$ Using the formula (Grafakos, Classical Fourier Analysis, Appendix D) $$C\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} F(x\cdot \omega)d\sigma(\omega)= \int_{-1}^{1}F(s|x|)(\sqrt{1-s^2})^{n-3} ds$$ we have $$I_{\alpha}(x)= e^{-|x|^2}
\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{-1}^{1}
e^{-2 s|x| r}(\sqrt{1-s^2})^{n-3} ds 
e^{-r^2}r^{n-1-\alpha}dr.$$ Applying Fubini's theorem one more time $$I_{\alpha}(x)= e^{-|x|^2}
\int_{-1}^{1}\int_{0}^{\infty}
e^{-2 s|x| r-r^2}r^{n-1-\alpha}dr(\sqrt{1-s^2})^{n-3} ds.$$ Is there a way to calculate $$\int_{0}^{\infty}
e^{-2 s|x| r-r^2}r^{n-1-\alpha}dr$$ Mathematica gives some kind of the hypergeometric function. It is difficult to understand how Mathematica's answer behaves in terms of $\alpha$ .","['integration', 'multivariable-calculus', 'analysis', 'real-analysis']"

4208823,If $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$ then $A \coprod B \subseteq X \coprod Y$.,"I am beginning to study algebraic topology. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces. In the lecture notes, the topology of $X \coprod Y$ was defined in the following way:
""the open subsets are precisely those of the form $A \coprod B$ with $A \in \tau_X$ and $B \in \tau_Y$ "". This tacitly implies that if $A \subseteq X$ and $B \subseteq Y$ then $A \coprod B \subseteq X \coprod Y$ . I drew the following diagram for this situation: $\require{AMScd}$ \begin{CD}
A @>{i_A}>> A \coprod B @<{i_B}<< B\\
@V{\iota_A}VV @V{\phi}VV @V{\iota_B}VV\\
X @>{i_X}>> X \coprod Y @<{i_Y}<< Y

4208828,Tranformations of Curves,"A while ago I asked a question similar to this, but looking back, I think I would have to further clarify. Please excuse how I ask this question, as I am very new to the Math Stack Exchange. Suppose I have a curve, with one endpoint on the origin of the x-y axis, and the other at some other point on the x-axis. In other words, the two endpoints of the curve are on (0,0) and some (x,0) If I were to change the position of the latter endpoint (x,0), how do other points on curve f(x) change with respect to the change of (x,0)? Intuitively, if I have a string, and I stretch an endpoint to some other position, how does the original string change? Moreover, if I were to move that endpoint in a specific path (represented as a function), what would the paths of the other points on the curve be? Looking at the problem, I thought about representing the function as a series of points, to which I would draw respective lines through each point, and would then calculate the motion of the other points with respect to the change of the latter endpoint. I did this for a 'one-point system', which is merely a point connected with 2 lines, with these lines connecting towards the two endpoints listed above (I would draw a diagram but I do not know how to on this software). Doing this, I found an equation, although it was huge. I then did this for two-point systems, and I soon realized that the solutions would be much bigger than I imagined. I am sure that if I continued to work on this problem, I would arrive at somewhat of a verdict. However, the people on this Stack Exchange are much more well-trained in mathematics than I am. And so my question is this: Does a solution currently exist to this problem? If so, what is it? If not, how would I further proceed with the method I used above? How would you all solve the problem? Please note that the new, transformed curve is subject to the previous curve's arc length (the original and new curve have the same length). The question I seek to find is how the original curve changes into its new form. Again, please excuse any difficulties with how I have written this post.

After dividing $\Gamma(s)$ , summing up on both sides and changing the variable, I got the following equation( needed to be proven): $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\sin(k\tan^{-1}(x))}{(x^2+1)^{\frac{k}{2}}}=\frac{1}{x}$ . I noticed that $\tan^{-1}(x)=\cos^{-1}({(x^{2}+1)^{-\frac{1}{2}}})$ , so after substitution, this is the equivalent equation: $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \sin((k+1)x)\cos(x)^k = \csc(x)$ . I have worked a lot and I found some other equations (with the assumption that the equation above is true): $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \cos((k+2)x)\cos(x)^{k}= -1$ , $\sum_{k=0}^\infty \cos(kx)\cos(x)^{k}= 1$ By using those equations, with the formula $(\cos(x)+i\sin(x))^n=\cos(nx)+i\sin(nx)$ , I could form a geometric series which visually proves that my assumption is true.

The questions are inserted from time to time within the proof. Thanks for your patience. Notation Let $Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety. Letting $S=k[x_0,\dots, x_n]$ (equipped with the usual grading $S=\oplus_{r\ge 0} S_r$ ), there is a naturale grading on $S(Y)=S/I(Y)$ which is constructed as follows: for each integer $r\ge 0$ define $$S(Y)_r:=S_r/I(Y)_r:=\{f+I(Y)_r\;:\; f\in S_r\}$$ where $I(Y)_r=I(Y)\cap S_r.$ Theorem. Let $Y\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be a projective variety with homogeneous coordinate ring $S(Y)$ . Then we have: $(a)\quad$ for any point $P\in Y$ , let $\mathcal{m}_P\subseteq S(Y)$ denote the ideal generated by the set of all homogeneous elements $f\in S(Y)$ such that $f(P)=0$ . Then $\mathcal{O}_P=S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}$ ; $(b)\quad$ $K(Y)\cong S(Y)_{((0))}$ Proof. Let $U_i\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n$ be the open set defined by $x_i\ne 0$ and set $Y_i:= Y\cap U_i$ . We may consider $Y_i$ as an affine variety. We can construct a natural isomorphism $$\varphi_i^*\colon A(Y_i)\to S(Y)_{(x_i)}$$ as $$\varphi_i^*\bigg(f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-i},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)\bigg)=\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r},$$ where $f\in S_r$ . $(b)\quad$ Let $P\in Y$ and chose any $i$ so that the $i-$ th coordinate of $P$ is non-zero. Then $P\in Y\cap U_i$ . We may write $P=[a_0:\dots: a_{i-1}:1:a_i:\dots: a_n]$ . Set $P_0:=(a_0,\dots, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1},\dots, a_n)=\varphi_i(P)$ , the corresponding point in the affine space. Denote with $\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}$ the maximal ideal of $A(Y_i)$ corresponding to $P_0$ . More precisely, $$\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}=\bigg\{g+I(Y_i)\in A(Y_i)\;:\; g(P_0)=0\bigg\}.$$ It's easy to prove that: $$\boxed{\varphi_i^*(\mathcal{m'}_{P_0})=\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$$ Recall that the product in the right of the above equation is interpreted in the localization as follows (with the natural induced grading on the quotient ring $S(Y)=S/I(Y))$ $$\mathcal{m}_p\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}=\bigg\{\frac{f(x_0\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}\;:\; f+I(Y)_r\in\mathcal{m}_P\cap S(Y)_r\;\text{for same}\; r\ge 0\bigg\}.$$ Using this isomorphism, we then have the isomorphism of the localizations $$A(Y_i)_{\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}}\cong \big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$$ Question 1. I believe that the last isomorphism can be obtained from exercise number 4 on page 44 of Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Atiyay - MacDonald, is that so? We need to argue that $$\big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}\cong S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}\tag1$$ Question2. Why $(1)$ is not usual transitivity of localizations? A typical element in $\big(S(Y)_{(x_i)}\big)_{\mathcal{m}_P\cdot S(Y)_{(x_i)}}$ is of the form $$\frac{\frac{f+I(Y)_{s+r}}{x_i^{r+s}+I(Y)_{s+r}}}{\frac{g+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}\equiv \frac{f+I(Y)_{s+r}}{x_i^sg+I(Y)_{s+r}}$$ where $g+I(Y)_r\notin\mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_r$ , and the identification takes place in the quotient field of $S(Y)$ . Now since $x_i^s+I(Y)_s\notin \mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_s$ it follows that the product $x_i^sg +I(Y)_{s+r}\notin\mathcal{m}_p\cap S(Y)_{s+r}$ . So the element on the right is a degree $0$ element of the localization $$S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\big(S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}\big)_n$$ where $$\big(S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_P}\big)_n=\bigg\{\frac{p+I(Y)_{n+r}}{q+I(Y)_r}\;:\; q+I(Y)_r\notin \mathcal{m}_P\cap S(Y)_r\;\text{for same}\; r\ge 0\bigg\}.$$ This proves that $$A(Y_i)_{\mathcal{m'}_{P_0}}\cong (S(Y)_{\mathcal{m}_p})_0=S(Y)_{(\mathcal{m}_P)}$$ $(b)\quad$ Observe that $K(Y)\cong K(Y_i)$ . The final part is to show that $$K(Y_i)\cong S(Y)_{((0))}.$$ We have already obtained the isomorphism $\varphi_i^*\colon A(Y_i)\to S(Y)_{(x_i)}$ . Extending this isomorpgism to $\tilde{\varphi_i^{*}}$ on the quotient fields fo both the sides we get $$\tilde{\varphi_i^*}\bigg(\frac{f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}{g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}\bigg)=\frac{\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}{\frac{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_s}{x_i^s+I(Y)_s}}=\frac{x_i^s f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r+s}}{x_i^rg(x_0, \dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r+s}}$$ In the denominator of the last expression above we have $g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_s\ne 0$ So to make sense of this, we need $x_i^r+I(Y)_r\ne 0$ as well. Since $I(Y)$ is a homogeneous prime ideal, this is violated only if $x_i\in I(Y)$ . I have proved that $x_i\in I(Y)$ is equivalent to $Y_i=\emptyset$ , which is absurd according to our choise of $U_i$ . Finally, notice that the element in the image of $\tilde{\varphi_i^*}$ in above are elements of $S(Y)_{((0))}$ . Question 3 It remains to show that every element of $S(Y)_{((0))}$ is also an image of an element of $K(Y_i)$ . How can I show this? My Solution for question 3. A typical element in $S(Y)_{((0))}$ is of the form $$\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r},$$ where $f+I(Y)_r\in S(Y)_r$ and $g+I(Y)_r\notin S(Y)_r\cap (0)$ . Let us consider the dehomogenized of $f$ and $g$ : $$f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n)\quad\text{and}\quad g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n),$$ where $\deg f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n)= \deg g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1}, 1, y_i,\dots, y_n) = r$ , results $$\begin{split}\tilde{\varphi_i^*}\bigg(\frac{f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}{g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}\bigg)=&\frac{\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}{\frac{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}\\
=\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}{g(x_0, \dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}\end{split}$$ The above happens just in case $x_i\nmid f$ and $x_i \nmid g$ . Suppose now that $x_i\mid f(x_0,\dots, x_n)$ and that $x_i\nmid g(x_0,\dots, x_n)$ We denote by $h(x_0,\dots, x_n)$ the homogenized polynomial of $f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1,\,y_i,\dots, y_n)$ , then $h\in S_{\deg f}$ , then $$
\begin{split}
\tilde{\varphi_i^*}\bigg(\frac{f(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}{g(y_1,\dots, y_{i-1},1, y_i, \dots, y_n)+I(Y_i)}\bigg)=
\frac{\frac{h(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{\deg f}}{x_i^{\deg f}+I(Y)_{\deg f}}}{\frac{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{x_i^r+I(Y)_r}}=&\frac{x_i^{r-\deg f} h(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}{g(x_0, \dots, x_n)+I(Y)_{r}}\\
=&\frac{f(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}{g(x_0,\dots, x_n)+I(Y)_r}

4209167,The expected distance between two points on a sphere and on a circle,"Two points are randomly selected on the circle. What is the expected
distance between them? And what will be the expected distance between
the two points on a sphere? An interesting problem, I had several ideas: we can generate a uniform distribution in an $n$ -dimensional cube described around a unit ball, remove points outside the ball from the sample, and obtain a uniform distribution of vectors in the ball. We normalize the vectors - we get on the sphere. And we use Monte Carlo.... Of course, there are a lot of iterations, and the accuracy is low, but for a rough estimate and for checking the exact calculations, it will do well. I also reasoned like this: since the task does not change when rotating, I can take one point fixed. We get the expectation of the distance from a random point of the circle to a fixed one. This is an obvious integral: $$ \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sqrt{(1-\cos x)^{2}+\sin ^{2} x}\,dx=\frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left|\sin \frac{x}{2}\right|dx=\frac{2}{\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin \frac{x}{2}\,dx=\frac{4}{\pi}$$ - for the unit circle, of course. $$ \begin{aligned} &\frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin \theta \sqrt{(1-\cos \theta)^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta \cos ^{2} \varphi+\sin ^{2} \theta \sin ^{2} \varphi}\, d \varphi d \theta= \\ &=\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\pi} 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \sin \theta\, d \theta=\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\pi} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}-\cos \frac{3 \theta}{2} d \theta=\left.\left(\sin \frac{\theta}{2}-\frac{1}{3} \sin \frac{3 \theta}{2}\right)\right|_{0} ^{\pi}=\frac{4}{3} \end{aligned}.$$ -and this is for the sphere. Parameterization of the sphere: $z=\cos(\theta)$ , $x=\sin(\theta)\cos(φ)$ , $y=\sin(\theta)\sin(φ)$ . As a fixed point we take $(0,0,1)$ . Jacobian $\sin(\theta)$ . I took a slightly non-standard parameterization relative to theta, so that later I would not mess with things like $\sin (\pi/4-\theta/2)$ . Here are my thoughts. I ask you to double-check me and, if possible, write your own version.","['calculus', 'probability-distributions', 'geometry', 'probability']"
4209178,Random walk returning probability: Back to the origin,"Considering a discrete random walk in 2D starting from $(0,0)$ with 1/4 probability of moving in each of the four directions for each step, calculate the probability of returning to $(0,0)$ after $2n$ moves. For instance, the probability for the point returing to its origin (0,0) after $2$ moves is: $4/4^2 = 0.25$ . I have got an answer as follows, but I think it is not elegant: After 2n moves, there are $4^{2n}$ outcomes. Let A be the event in which the point returns, and $n(A_{n})$ be the number of outcomes in event A. Suppose A include the point moving upwards and downwards $k$ times(so that the point will not shift in the y-axis direction), and rightwards and leftwards $(n-k)$ times. In such case, there are $\displaystyle{\frac{(2n)!}{[k!k!(n-k)!(n-k)!]}}$ outcomes. Sum up to get event A: $
\begin{eqnarray}
n(A_{n}) &=&  \displaystyle{\sum^{n}_{k=0}\frac{(2n)!}{(k!)^2[(n-k)!]^2}}= 
\displaystyle{\frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}}\sum_{k=0}^{n} \left[ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \right]^2 \\
&=&   \displaystyle{ \binom{2n}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n}}\binom{n}{k}^2 = \displaystyle{\binom{2n}{n}^2} \\ \text{because} \displaystyle{ \sum_{i=0}^{n}\binom{n}{i}^2=\binom{2n}{n}}
\end{eqnarray}
$ Hence, the probability of returning is $P(A_n)=\displaystyle{\frac{ \binom{2n}{n}^2}{4^{2n}} } $ Obseving the numerator I think there might be some easy ways to figure out the answer: Since the point "" moves upwards and downwards $k$ times "", and "" leftwards and rightwards $(n-k)$ times "", if combining the number of steps moving $\color{red}{up}$ and $\color{red}{right}$ it would be $\color{red}{n}$ steps in total, and choose $\color{red}{n}$ steps from $2n$ , there would be $\color{fuchsia}{\binom{2n}{n}}$ possibilities. Considering the answer above $P(A_n)=\displaystyle{\frac{ \binom{2n}{n}^2}{4^{2n}} } $ , the product and numerator $\binom{2n}{n} \binom{2n}{n} $ must contain the event $A$ , which is ""the point moves upwards and downwards $k$ times , and leftwards and rightwards $(n-k)$ times. Let the first part $\binom{2n}{n} $ contain ""moving $n$ steps leftwards and upwards in total"", and let the second part $\binom{2n}{n} $ contain ""moving $n$ steps rightwards and upwards in total"". Together, I get the event $A$ ,

4209251,"Link between left Poisson bracket, Hamiltonian vector field and the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field","I am going through Variations on a Theme by Kepler , Guillemin and Sternberg. It is stated that a symplectic transformation on a manifold $\phi:X \rightarrow X$ induces a transformation on function. $$f \rightsquigarrow f \circ \phi^{-1}
$$ They say: It turns out that every function $f$ on phase space generates a (local) one-parameter group, $\phi_t$ , of symplectic transformations such that $$\{f, g\} = \dfrac{d}{dt}g \circ \phi_{-t}\rvert_{t=0}
$$ My understanding is that they are referring to the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field $X^f = \{f, \cdot\}$ $$\phi_t = \exp(tX^f)
$$ I am however confused as to how everything fits together. We have for the flow $\rho$ of a complete vector field $X$ that: $$\dfrac{d\rho_t(p)}{dt} = X(\rho_t(p))
$$ and so $$X^f(g) = \{f, g\} = \dfrac{d}{dt}g \circ \phi_{-t}\rvert_{t=0}
$$ Intuitively, it seems to me that there is a minus sign error, indeed we are considering the change in $g$ as we travel against the flow, and I would expect this to be $-X^f(g)$ I am asking this because I am trying to understand the statement ""left Poisson bracket by $f$ is the infinitesimal symmetry associated to $f$ "" and how the above statements fit together EDIT: According to Wikipedia, some authors define the Hamiltonian vector field with the opposite sign. My best answer is this must be the case here. $$-\{f, \cdot\} = X^f
$$ Then indeed $$X^f(g) = -\{f, g\} = -\dfrac{d}{dt}g \circ \phi_{-t}\rvert_{t=0}
$$ This can also be checked with the fact the Lie derivative for functions is $\mathcal{L}_X f = X(f)$ along with the general definition of the Lie derivative of a k-form: $$\mathcal{L}_X \omega := \dfrac{d}{dt}(\exp(tX))^*\omega \Big \rvert_{t=0}
$$ giving $$\mathcal{L}_X f = \dfrac{d}{dt}f \circ(\phi_t)) \Big \rvert_{t=0} = X(f)
$$ In this way, for a function $f$ , $-\{f, \cdot\}$ = $X^f$ is the infinitesimal generator for the one-parameter family of symmetry transformations on the manifold $$\phi_t:X\rightarrow X$$ $$\phi_t = \exp^{tX^f}$$ while $\phi^*_{-t}$ is the induced transformation on a function $g$ Is it thus correct to say the following ? $$\dfrac{d}{dt}\exp(tX)\Big\rvert_{t=0}f = X(f) = \dfrac{d}{dt}f\circ\exp(-tX)\Big\rvert_{t=0}

4209255,Algebraic(!!) version of the Riemann existence theorem,"In Appendix B to Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry , Hartshorne claims that one can prove that compact Riemann surfaces are algebraic in the following way.  First show there exists a nonconstant meromorphic function from $X$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$ , which realizes $X$ as a ramified covering over $\mathbb{P}^1$ .  Second, use the Riemann existence theorem to show this gives $X$ the structure of a nonsingular algebraic curve. I am asking about this second step.  Everything I've seen about the Riemann existence theorem has been about the existence of things related to Riemann surfaces, not algebraic curves a priori.  For example, one statement is that the meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface separate points, and another is that if we prescribe certain ramification data over some $Y$ - $d$ points, then we can find a corresponding map of Riemann surfaces $X\rightarrow Y$ .  Anyways, I don't see any statement that says that $X$ must then be an algebraic curve (i.e. a complex projective variety of dim 1), and I would appreciate it if anybody gave me a reference or a proof of this particular step. And just to be clear: I know there are other proofs that $X$ is algebraic, but I am looking for the one Hartshorne is referring to here.  And of course I see the generalized Riemann existence theorem he states right after which is much more high-powered, but I'd like the elementary argument Hartshorne refers to.","['algebraic-curves', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'riemann-surfaces']"

In particular, I was studying a system comprised of two qubits (qubit is a standard shorthand for two level quantum system) separated by distance (in configuration space e.g. a laboratory) $R$ from one another and coupled to a one-dimensional Bosonic reservoir hosting a pair of boson species corresponding to right and left moving photon fields with linear dispersion relation and fixed propagation speed (equal to $1$ in my units (Planck's constant is set to be $2\pi$ )). It is really one of the simplest system one can imagine which possesses the so-called delayed coherent quantum feedback, a property that dynamics of the quantum system at any time $T$ depends on the entire history of its dynamics for all times $t\in[0, T]$ in deterministic (i.e. classical, not quantum, and thus very human-being controllable) fashion. You can easily guess that without any knowledge of physics whatsoever, you have quantum information that propagates with finite velocity $v=1$ over given distance $R$ , so there is an intrinsic time delay $\tau=vR$ in the system and due to Lorentz covariance this cannot be altered by any quantum effects. The Hamiltonian operator of such a system can be written as $H=H_{0}+V$ ,  where \begin{align}H_{0}&=\sum_{n=1, 2}\frac{\Delta_{n}}{2}\sigma_{3}^{(n)}+\sum_{\mu=1, 2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dk\omega_{\mu}(k)a^{\dagger}_{\mu}(k)a_{\mu}(k),\\V&=\sum_{n=1, 2}\sum_{\mu=1, 2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}dkg_{\mu, n}(k)a^{\dagger}_{\mu}(k)\sigma_{+}^{(n)}+g_{\mu, n}^{*}(k)\sigma_{-}^{(n)}a_{\mu}(k).\end{align} Here $\Delta_{n}$ is the detuning of the qubit number $n$ from some reference energy $k_{0}$ , i.e. $\Delta_{n}=\Omega_{n}-k_{0}$ , where $\Omega_{n}$ is the transition frequency of the qubit number $n$ and $k_{0}$ is the momentum around which the spectrum of the bath of boson fields was linearised (we of course expect photons of energy ( $hvk_{0}/(2\pi)=k_{0}$ ) $k_{0}$ to couple most strongly to some system with transition frequency $\min[\Omega_{1}, \ \Omega_{2}]$ ). Further, $\omega_{\mu}(k)=hvk/(2\pi)=k$ is the energy of the photon of flavour $\mu$ and momentum $k$ . Such a photon is created by operator $a^{\dagger}_{\mu}(k)$ and destroyed by $a_{\mu}(k)$ , these obey non-zero commutation $[a_{\mu}(k), a^{\dagger}_{\mu'}(k')]=\delta(k-k')\delta_{\mu, \mu'}$ . $\sigma_{j}^{(1)}=\sigma_{j}\otimes\sigma_{0}, \ \sigma_{j}^{(2)}=\sigma_{0}\otimes\sigma_{j}$ , where $\sigma_{\pm}=(\sigma_{1}+i\sigma_{2})/2$ , and $\sigma_{1,2, 3}$ are usual Pauli-matrices ( $\sigma_{0}$ is an identity on $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ ). The coupling constants are defined as $$g_{\mu, n}(k)=\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma_{n}}{2\pi}}e^{-ic_{\mu}c_{n}(k_{0}+k)R/2},$$ where $\Gamma_{n}$ is the bare decay rate of a single qubit into the continuum, and $c_{s}=(-)^{s+1}, \ s=\mu, \ n$ distinguishes the coupling to right/left (with index $\mu$ ) photons of an atom number $n=1, 2$ , located at $\pm R/2$ . As a mock up problem I consider the following. Consider the system described above Hamiltonian prepared at time $t_{0}=0$ in the following 2-parameter family of states $$|\psi(0)\rangle=(\cos\vartheta|1\rangle\otimes|0\rangle+e^{i\varphi/2}\sin\vartheta|0\rangle\otimes|1\rangle)\otimes|\Omega\rangle.$$ Here the quantum states are ordered as qubit 1, qubit 2, bath, i.e. $|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle\otimes|c\rangle$ = qubit one is in state $a$ , qubit $2$ is in $b$ and bosons are in $c$ . Here $|\Omega\rangle$ is the ""vacuum"" state of bosons defined by $a_{\mu}(k)|\Omega\rangle=0,\forall \mu=1,2 , \ k\in\mathbb{R}$ . In physics you'll call such a setup a spontaneous emission problem. I was able to deduce with the help of diagrammatic techniques (see our recent paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07603.pdf related to the $T\rightarrow\infty$ limit of non-Markovian systems) that the exact survival probability amplitude for an initial state defined above has the form (this result is exact in all parameter regime iff $\Theta(t)$ the Heaviside step function is defined equal to $1$ at $t=0$ , it is indeed ambiguous since we use use both Hille–Yosida theorem and Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem which are good until $T=t_{0}=0$ where divergencies happen, then you have to maintain the order of limits with some care) $$P(t)=|a(t)|^{2},\quad a(t)=\oint_{C_{+\eta}}\langle{\psi(0)|G(z)|\psi(0)\rangle}e^{-izt}\frac{dz}{2\pi i}, \ t>0.$$ Here the integration contour $C_{+\eta}$ is a Bromiwich style contour suspending itself above the real axis with positive imaginary part $\eta\searrow0$ . $G(z)$ is the operator valued function known in physics as the retarded Green's function. One thus sees that all important information about dynamics is contained in the poles and branch cuts of $G(z)$ . The projection of the retarded Green's function onto the single atomic excitation subspace can be determined analytically in the exact form: $$
G^{(1)}(z)=\frac{1}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}}(g_{1}(zc|10\rangle\langle{10}|+g_{2}(z)|01\rangle\langle{01}|$$ $$-ig_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\sqrt{\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}}e^{i(z+k_{0})R}(\sigma_{+}^{(1)}\sigma_{-}^{(2)}+\sigma_{-}^{(2)}\sigma_{+}^{(1)})$$ $$=G_{e1}(z)|10\rangle\langle{10}|+G_{e2}(z)|01\rangle\langle{01}|+G_{o}(\sigma_{+}^{(1)}\sigma_{-}^{(2)}+\sigma_{-}^{(2)}\sigma_{+}^{(1)}),
$$ where \begin{align}
G_{ej}(z)=\frac{g_{j}(z)}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}}, \quad G_{o}(z)=\frac{-ig_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\sqrt{\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}}e^{i(z+k_{0})R}}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}},
\end{align} and $g_{j}(z)=(z-\Delta_{j}+i\Gamma_{j})^{-1}$ are the single-quit green's functions (note that their Laplace transform is trivial $e^{-i\Delta_{j}t}e^{-\Gamma_{j}t}$ due to locality (like you've learned in high school-an exponential decay)). The complete answer is a bit involved but can be clearly expressed in terms of Fourier images of $G_{ej}(z), \ G_{o}(z)$ , these are \begin{align}
G_{e1}(t)&=\oint_{C_{+\eta}}\frac{dz}{2\pi i}\frac{g_{1}(z)}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}}e^{-izt}\\
&=e^{-i\Delta_{1}t}e^{-\Gamma_{1}t}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2ik_{0}R})^{m}I(2m, m+1, m, t),\\
G_{e2}(t)&=\oint_{C_{+\eta}}\frac{dz}{2\pi i}\frac{g_{2}(z)}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}}e^{-izt}\\
&=e^{-i\Delta_{2}t}e^{-\Gamma_{2}t}+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}(-\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2ik_{0}R})^{m}I(2m, m, m+1, t),\\
G_{o}(t)&=\oint_{C_{+\eta}}\frac{dz}{2\pi i}\frac{-ig_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\sqrt{\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}}e^{i(z+k_{0})R}}{1+g_{1}(z)g_{2}(z)\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2i(z+k_{0})R}}e^{-izt}\\
=&-i\sqrt{\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}}e^{ik_{0}R}\sum_{m=0}^{\infty}(-\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{2}e^{2ik_{0}R})^{m}I(2m+1, m+1, m+1, t)
\end{align} where \begin{align}
&I(a, b, c, t)=\oint_{C_{+\eta}}\frac{dz}{2\pi i}e^{-iz(t-aR)}g_{1}^{b}(z)g_{2}^{c}(z)
=\int_{C_{+}}\frac{dz}{2\pi{i}}\frac{e^{-iz(t-aR)}}{(z-\Delta_{1}+i\Gamma_{1})^{b}(z-\Delta_{2}+i\Gamma_{2})^{c}}\\
&=\Theta(t-aR)\Bigg(\sum_{k=0}^{b-1}\frac{(-1)^{k}(c+k-1)!(-i(t-aR))^{b-k-1}}{k!(b-k-1)!(c-1)!}\frac{e^{-i\Delta_{1}(t-aR)}e^{-\Gamma_{1}(t-aR)}}{(\Delta_{2}-\Delta_{1}+i(\Gamma_{2}-\Gamma_{1}))^{c+k}}\\
&+\sum_{k=0}^{c-1}\frac{(-1)^{k}(b+k-1)!(-i(t-aR))^{c-k-1}}{k!(c-k-1)!(b-1)!}\frac{e^{-i\Delta_{2}(t-aR)}e^{-\Gamma_{2}(t-aR)}}{(\Delta_{1}-\Delta_{2}+i(\Gamma_{1}-\Gamma_{2}))^{b+k}}\Bigg).
\end{align} So far so good. These functions are looking physically correct, etc. You can see an infinite number of revival peaks in survival probability which happen on all integer multiples of delay time $vR$ , i.e. when the photon emitted by one atom reaches the other, isn't it cool you can control what atom does by just moving it around?=) Many physicists though are recently discussing the possibility of so called DARK states, the states for which $p(t)=1, \ \forall t>0$ . Their argument is based on Markov approximation though, it is the limit where $\max{\Gamma_{n}}_{n=1, \ 2}\times vR\ll1$ . The first assumption to be done is that the quits are equivalent and ""bright"" (no detuning) $\Delta_{1}=\Delta_{2}=0, \ \Gamma_{n}=\Gamma$ . The second is $\theta=\pi/4, \mod 2\pi, \varphi=4\pi, \mod 2\pi$ for bright and $\theta=\pi/4, \mod 2\pi, \varphi=2\pi, \mod 2\pi$ for dark states. My analysis shows \begin{align}
\label{eq: DE58}
p_{B}(t)=&\Bigg{|}G_{e}(t)+G_{o}(t)\Bigg{|}^{2}=\Bigg{|}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Theta(t-nR)\frac{(-\Gamma(t-nR))^{n}}{n!}e^{-\Gamma(t-nR)}\Bigg{|}^{2},\\
\label{eq: DE59}
p_{D}(t)=&\Bigg{|}G_{e}(t)-G_{o}(t)\Bigg{|}^{2}=\Bigg{|}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\Theta(t-nR)\frac{(\Gamma(t-nR))^{n}}{n!}e^{-\Gamma(t-nR)}\Bigg{|}^{2}.
\end{align} I.e. for the dark state we obtain $p_{D}(t)=1, \forall t>0$ at $R=0$ . For $R\neq0$ when $t\rightarrow \infty$ the sereies converges to a finite value $$p(t)\rightarrow\text{constant}.$$ By numerical exercise I'd like to claim that the $t$ infinity limit of $p_{D}(t)$ is precisely $1/(1+\Gamma R)^{2}$ . Can you help me to prove or disprove that? And if you happen to know the closed form the above series do not hesitate to share. By the long-time limit I understand you take above series with all $\Theta$ equal to $1$ (do not bother about how rigorous this is please). To be specific: if you happen to know something about series like $x^{n}(c-nx)^n/n!$ give us a clue. Another clue from numerics: at super large times $\Gamma t\gg1$ we deduce that the quantum decay of bright state follows a sub-exponential power law $1/t$ in the long time regime. Numerics show the $R/(2\pi t)$ law, see picture.","['quantum-field-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'mathematical-physics', 'real-analysis']"
4209443,Problems with seemingly not enough information,"Two of my favorite geometry problems are as follows: Consider two concentric circles with the property that a chord of the larger circle with length 20 is tangent to the inner circle.  What is the area of the region between the circles? Consider a sphere with a circular hole drilled through its center, such that the height of the remaining ring (in the direction along the hole) is $h$ .  What is the volume of the ring? The fascinating thing about these problems is that they seem to be under-determined: In the first case, it seems that you should need to know at least one of the circles' radii; in the second case it seems that you should need to know the radius of the sphere or the radius of the hole.  It turns out that the answer is independent of these unknown quantities, however, so the questions are well posed. Another cute fact about these problems is that, supposing them to be well posed, they admit very easy computations of their answers, since we can choose the unknown parameters to be whatever we want to facilitate the computation: In the first case, choosing the radius of the inner circle to be zero, the chord is a diameter of the outer circle, and the desired area is just the area of the same circle, $\pi \times 10^2 = 100 \pi$ . In the second case, choosing the radius of the hole to be zero, the volume is just that of a full sphere of radius $h/2$ , i.e. $\frac{1}{6}\pi h^3$ . Question: What are other examples of problems which seem to be ill-posed, but are not? I once thought that these two problems were anomalous, but I've recently discovered there are other examples.  (I will post one if no one else does.)  The examples need not come from geometry.  Please post only one problem per answer, and if (as with the above problems) a computation is simplified by assuming the problem to be well posed, please explain.","['big-list', 'geometry']"
4209471,A modified median,"Assume we have real numbers $x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n$ .
Consider the following function which returns the average distance of a point $t$ from $x_1,\dots,x_n.$ $$
D_1(t) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i - t|.
$$ It is well known that $D_1(t)$ is minimized at a median of $x_1,\dots,x_n$ . I am interested in the centrality parameter that is obtained when the mean is replaced by the median above (you may assume $n$ is odd and $n \geq 3$ if it helps). So, my question is this : Is there a simple expression for $$ \arg\min D_2(t) $$ where $$
D_2(t) = \operatorname{median}\{|x_1-t|,\dots,|x_n-t|\}?
$$ I have done some numerical experiments. I think that there is always a minimum at a point of the form $\frac{x_i + x_j}{2}$ where $i \leq j$ and $\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}\leq x_{i+1}.$ This problem is combinatorial because one has to keep track of how the order of $|x_i - t|$ 's change as $t$ changes. Update: User Joe has conjectured that if $n=2k+1$ is odd then the minimum occurs that $t = \frac{x_m + x_{m+k}}{2}$ where $m = \arg\min (x_{m+k} - x_m)$ . The plot of the objective function for $1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 20$ shows that a median may not be the minimizer. The conjecture is valid here (k=3), a minimum occurs at $\frac{x_1+x_4}{2}$ and $x_4-x_1=9$ . Another example where the conjecture is valid. Here $k=4$ and the minimum occurs at $\frac{x_1+x_5}{2}=3.$","['optimization', 'statistics', 'combinatorics']"
4209496,Alternative to the Binomial PMF?,"Since hypergeometric distribution is the without replacement version of the Binomial distribution why can't we replace the combinations in the Hypergeometric PMF with combinations with replacement and expect the same result with the standard Binomial PMF ? To elaborate this is the regular combination formula counting unordered without replacement : $$C(n,r)= \frac{n!}{r!(n−r)!}$$ And this is the combination with replacement formula counting unordered with replacement: $$C^R(n,r)= \frac{(n+r−1)!}{r!(n−1)!}$$ and this is the hypergeometric distribution PMF: For $X\sim\operatorname{HGeom}(w,b,n)$ $$P(X=k)= \frac{C(w,k)C(b,n-k)}{C(w+b,n)}$$ My question is, since binomial and hypergeometric are both fixed number of trials where Binomial is counting with replacement and Hypergeometric is counting without replacement, why doesn't altering the Hypergeometric formula to be $$P(X=k)= \frac{C^R(w,k)C^R(b,n-k)}{C^R(w+b,n)}$$ give us the PMF of the Binomial Distribution ?

&=\int_K \phi_\sigma(x) \exp((1/2\sigma^2)(2x^\top y-|y|^2)) dx.
\end{align*} For $\sigma \to \infty$ , the term $\exp((1/2\sigma^2)(2x^\top y-|y|^2))$ goes to 1 locally uniformly in $x$ and $y$ , so we can infer that $$
\frac{P(X_\sigma+y\in K)}{P(X_\sigma\in K)} \xrightarrow{\sigma\to\infty} 1
$$ locally uniformly in $y$ . Here's where my argument becomes sloppy: For sufficiently large $N\in\Bbb N$ and $\sigma>0$ we should then have \begin{align*}

4211730,Lowenheim-Skolem number for satisfaction via continuous function rings,"EDIT: now asked at MO . For $\mathcal{X}$ a topological space, let $C(\mathcal{X})$ be the ring of continuous functions $\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ . For a first-order sentence $\varphi$ in the language of rings, write $\mathcal{X}\models_{C}\varphi$ iff $C(\mathcal{X})\models\varphi$ in the usual sense. Say that $\varphi$ is C -satisfiable iff $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ for some topological space $\mathcal{X}$ . I'm generally curious about analogues of classical model-theoretic questions in this context. For example: What is the least cardinal $\kappa$ such that, if $\varphi$ is $C$ -satisfiable, then $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ for some space $\mathcal{X}$ with cardinality $<\kappa$ ? The obvious Lowenheim-Skolem argument doesn't help much here. Roughly speaking, given $\mathcal{X}\models_C\varphi$ we can form a ""small"" elementary substructure $(\mathcal{Y}, R)$ in the usual first-order sense of (an appropriate version of) the pair $(\mathcal{X},C(\mathcal{X}))$ . However, in general we might have $R\subsetneq C(\mathcal{Y})$ (this is similar to the distinction between Henkin and standard semantics for second-order logic). (Of course number of points isn't the only cardinal invariant for which we could ask a Lowenheim-Skolem flavored question, but it seems the simplest to start with. Another natural thing to do would be to restrict attention to a ""nice"" class of spaces, e.g. the compact Hausdorff spaces , but again this seems like a better first step.) One issue here is that I don't know an abstract characterization of which rings are isomorphic to some $C(\mathcal{X})$ . Obviously any such ring $R$ must be the underlying ring of a commutative associative unital $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra, but beyond that I don't see anything. I recall seeing a very snappy theorem addressing this, but I can't find it at the moment (I think it was more complicated than just ""any commutative associative unital $\mathbb{R}$ -algebra's underlying ring,"" but I'm not certain). My broader interest incidentally is in what happens if we replace $\mathbb{R}$ with some other topological structure (= first-order structure + topology such that all functions are continuous and all relations are closed, as subsets of the appropriate product space) . Given a topological structure $\mathcal{A}$ and a topological space $\mathcal{X}$ we can always turn the set of continuous maps from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{A}$ into a structure of the same type as $\mathcal{A}$ by defining everything ""pointwise."" So for each topological structure $\mathcal{A}$ we get an analogue $\models_C^\mathcal{A}$ of the relation $\models_C$ above. Ultimately my interest is in developing a connection between ""coarse"" model-theoretic properties (e.g. variants of the Lowenheim-Skolem number) of $\models_C^\mathcal{A}$ and topological algebraic properties of $\mathcal{A}$ . While this question specifically asks about $\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{R}$ , if anyone has information about a different (""nontrivial"") $\mathcal{A}$ or class of $\mathcal{A}$ s I'd be very interested.","['model-theory', 'logic', 'functional-analysis', 'general-topology', 'set-theory']"

4211777,"Choice of $\delta$ for ""brute force"" proof of continuity of exponential function $e^x$","I have read several answers ( example 1 , example 2 ) about continuity of $e^x$ , but most rely on Power Series definition of $e^x$ , or sequential definition of a limit, or squeeze theorem. I would like a brute-force proof that meets the following criteria: Does NOT use sequential definition of limit Does NOT use Squeeze Theorem Uses $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity directly Does NOT use perturbations (e.g. $|e^{a + h} - e^a|$ ) Uses definition of limit, starting with a $0 < |x-a| < \delta$ and ending with $|e^x - e^a| < \epsilon$ Is NOT based on power series definition of $e^x$ Is based on elementary limit definition $e^x = \lim_{n \to 0} (1+n)^{\frac{x}{n}}$ I would like to use exponential bounds (which come from Bernoulli's Inequality) like this answer : \begin{align*}
y+1 \le \ & \ e^y \le \frac{1}{1-y} \\
\to \quad \quad y \le \ & \ e^y - 1 \ \le \ \frac{y}{1-y} \\
\to \quad x-a \le \ & \ e^{x-a}-1 \ \le \ \frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}
\end{align*} except I am trying to modify that proof so it doesn't depend on Squeeze Theorem. Proof attempt : Let $\epsilon > 0$ and $a > 0$ arbitrary. Choose $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{e^a}$ . Then \begin{align*}
& \quad 0 < |x - a| < \delta \quad \quad \quad \textrm{ (Given)}\\
&\to \quad |e^{x-a}-1| \quad < \delta \quad \quad \textrm{ (Reason unknown?)} \\
&\to \quad |e^{x-a}-1| < \frac{\epsilon}{e^a} \quad \quad \textrm{ (Substitute $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{e^a}$)} \\
&\to \quad e^a|e^{x-a}-1| < \epsilon \quad \quad \textrm{ (Multiply both sides by $e^a$)} \\

& \to \quad \lim_{x \to a} e^x = e^a \quad \quad \quad \textrm{ (Definition of limit)}
\end{align*} I know my proof is supposed to use the exponential bounds, $$x-a \le e^{x-a}-1 \le \frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)},$$ so I tried using it (probably incorrectly) in step 2. Just because $|x-a| < \delta$ doesn't mean $e^{x-a}-1$ (bigger) is also less than $\delta$ . It may be bigger than $\delta$ . So I am having trouble going from step 1 to step 2. Edit 7/29 ( $2^{nd}$ Proof Attempt) : Some comments are suggesting, based on Chappers' answer here , that I should choose $$\delta=\max\left\{|x-a|, \left|\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\right|\right\}.$$ Making this substitution, our proof becomes \begin{align*}
& \quad 0 < |x - a| < \delta \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad\textrm{ (Given)}\\
& \quad 0 < |x - a| < \max\left\{|x-a|, \left|\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\right| \right\} \quad \quad \quad \textrm{ (Substitution of $\delta$)}\\
&\quad \quad \quad \vdots \\
&\quad \quad \quad ? \\
&\quad \quad \quad \vdots \\
&\to \quad e^a|e^{x-a}-1| < \epsilon \quad \quad \textrm{ (Multiply both sides by $e^a$)} \\

& \to \quad \lim_{x \to a} e^x = e^a \quad \quad \quad \textrm{ (Definition of limit)}
\end{align*} I am not sure how to fill in the gaps. The left hand side needs to somehow become $e^a |e^{x-a}-1|$ . The right hand side needs to become $\epsilon$ . But it seems to me that by making this choice, $\delta$ is no longer a function of $\epsilon$ . Edit 8/19 (Final proof): For those it helps, here's my final proof based off Paramanand Singh's answer: Let $\epsilon > 0$ and $a>0$ arbitrary. Choose $\delta= \frac{1}{2}\min\left\{1,\frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\}$ . Then \begin{align*}
& \quad \left|x - a\right| < \delta \tag{Given} \\
\to& \quad \left|x - a\right| < \frac{1}{2} \min\left\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\} \tag{$\delta = \frac{1}{2}\min\left\{1,\frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\}$} \\
\to& \quad 2\left|x - a\right| < \min\left\{1, \frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\} \tag{Multiplication by 2} \\
\to& \quad \left|\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\right| < \min\left\{1,\frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\} \tag{$\left|\frac{h}{1-h}\right|<2|h|$ if $|h|<\frac{1}{2}$} \\
\to& \quad \left|\frac{x-a}{1-(x-a)}\right| < \frac{\epsilon}{e^a} \tag{$\min\left\{1,\frac{\epsilon}{e^a}\right\}< \frac{\epsilon}{e^a}$} \\

(and is this Riemannian metric given by $g_p(A,B)=tr(AB^{t})$ like $GL(n)$ ?) Why is this metric $d$ natural from the construction of the Grassmannian by the orthogonal group as was described above, and not from the alternative definition $GL(n)/H$ for $H$ the stabilizer of a $r$ -dimensional subspace?

This can be solved by using method of integrating factor; but without referring to it, I went for looking solution step-by-step with complexity, as follows. Simple Case: If it would have been $y'=e^x$ , i.e. $Dy=e^x$ , we could have taken integration of both sides to get $y=ae^x+b$ . (The method of integrating factor brings above equation to form $D(e^{-x}y)=1$ ) General Case: The right side is not only the function of $x$ , but some terms of the (unknown) function $y$ also; an easy example is the equation in title. We then move to collect terms of $y$ on one side, and keep function of $x$ other side. We can write main equation as $$(D-\mathbf{1})y=e^x,$$ and we want to invert $D-\mathbf{1}$ to get information of unknown $y$ . [In case $Dy=f(x)$ , we expect to get $y=\int f(x)$ , provided, $f(x)$ satisfies some conditions on given domain of it.] For $(D-\mathbf{1})y=e^x$ , I went to do like: $y=\frac{1}{D-\mathbf{1}}e^x= (\mathbf{1}+D+D^2+\cdots )(-e^x)$ . But, this last expression on RHS does not make sense since $D^n(-e^x)=-e^x$ for all integers $n\ge 0$ . Question: When does such method of inverting $D-\mathbf{1}$ or a polynomial expression of $D$ actually works to give solution of given differential equation - say $(D^r + a_1D^{r-1} + \cdots + a_r\mathbf{1})y=f(x)$ ?",['ordinary-differential-equations']

Now, let us assume that $X$ is defined over a field $K$ of characteristic zero and $H$ as before. We can prove that $\pi^{et}_1(H) \rightarrow \pi^{et}_1(X)$ is an isomorphism if $\dim X \geq 3$ using weak Lefschetz theorem and the comparison theorem for topological fundamental group of $X(\mathbb{C})$ and etale fundamental group of $X$ .

It seems that that the isomorphism on etale fundamental group continues to hold in positive characteristic under certain assumptions ( $H$ is also a regular hyperplane section.). Let us now turn to etale version of Lefschetz hyperplane theorem conerning higher homotopy groups. I am new to this topic so I might be making several mistakes here. There do exist notions of higher etale homotopy groups which was first developed by Artin-Mazur. I have come to know that the first fundamental group computed in this theory does not match up with the Grothendieck's etale fundamental group but with the fundamental group defined in SGA3. There is an agreement when $X$ is a normal noetherian scheme. With this in mind, we may ask the following question : Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field $K$ which can be of positive characteristic and let $H$ be moreover regular. Then what can we say about the induced map on higher etale homotopy groups? are they isomorphic in degrees up to $\dim X - 1$ ?","['algebraic-geometry', 'homotopy-theory']"

  \int_{-\infty}^{e_2}\frac{dt}{t\sqrt{(t-e_1)(t-e_2)(t-e_3)}}=c\int_{0}^{u_1}\frac{1-cnu}{1+\alpha\, cn u}
\end{align} for some constants $c,\alpha$ depending on the $e_i$ and $cn u_1=-1$ . The right hand side can be simplified to \begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\alpha}(-2K(m)+\frac{2}{1-\alpha}\Pi(\frac{\alpha^2}{\alpha^2-1},m))
\end{align} where $K$ and $\Pi$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and third kind, respectively. Edit2: I kind of found the solution by myself but this will probably not work in the general case because I have some additional information. Nevertheless, maybe the edit will help someone else. The following calculation should be right modulo signs. Assume that the imaginary part of $e_1$ is greater than zero (which is no restriction since we can just exchange $e_1$ and $e_3$ ). The additional information I have is that I know the imaginary part of the integral \begin{align*}
  \int_{e_1}^{e_2}\frac{dt}{t\sqrt{(t-e_1)(t-e_2)(t-e_3)}}.
\end{align*} Denote the imaginary part of this integral by $v$ . Since $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ is completely imaginary and $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}+\int_{e_3}^{\infty}+\int_{\infty}^{e_1}=0$ by the residue theorem we get $\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ . On the other hand $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}+\int_{e_2}^{e_3}+\int_{e_3}^{e_1}=2\pi i$ and hence $\int_{e_3}^{e_1}=2\pi i - 2 i v$ (as the imaginary part of $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}$ and $\int_{e_2}^{e_3}$ are the same). Therefore \begin{align*}
  \textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\pi  - v.
\end{align*} By holomorphicity $\int_{e_1}^{e_2}=\int_{e_1}^{-\infty}+\int_{-\infty}^{e_2}$ (above the branch cut). However, we also have $\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=\textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{-\infty}$ we and hence \begin{align*} 
  \textrm{Im}\int_{e_1}^{\infty}=v-\textrm{Im}\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}.
\end{align*} The integral $\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}$ is purely imaginary. Putting these equations together we can express the integral $\int_{e_1}^{e_3}$ in terms of some constants and the formula for $\int_{e_2}^{-\infty}$ in my first edit. Again, I did not take care of the signs in the integrations at all so be careful there. Remark: For the general case I tried to identify $\wp=x$ and then use the relations of Weierstrass elliptic functions for rhombic tori, i.e. $\wp(z)=e_2+H_2\frac{1+cn(z';m)}{1-cn(z';m)}$ (see Abramowitz/Stegun p. 649 for the notation).  We can integrate the Jacobi ellitpic functions (eq. 361.60 from Handbook of ellitpic functions ) and for the elliptic integral of the third kind I tried using the identities of the book Elliptic functions and applications, Lawden on page 76. But unfortunately I did not succed and mathematica always gave me wrong results.","['integration', 'elliptic-curves', 'elliptic-functions', 'indefinite-integrals', 'elliptic-integrals']"
4212129,Proof that f = g a.e. with Fatou's lemma,"In the book ""A user friendly introduction to Lebesgue measure and integration"" by Nelson, Exercise 24 in Ch. 2 states: Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of functions in $\mathcal L [a,b]$ . Suppose $f \in \mathcal L [a,b]$ and $$
\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_a^b|f_n-f| = 0.
$$ If the sequence $(f_n)$ converges pointwise a.e. on $[a,b]$ to the function $g$ , show that $f=g$ a.e. on $[a,b]$ .
Suggestion: Consider the sequence $(|f-f_n|)$ and Fatou's Lemma. My try: From $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n  =g$ a.e., we know that $\lim_{n\to\infty}  f_n -f  =  g - f$ a.e. and $\lim_{n\to\infty} | f_n -f | = | g - f|$ a.e.. Integrating, we have \begin{align}
0\leq \int_a^b|g-f|&=\int_a^b\lim_{n\to\infty}|f_n -f|=\int_a^b\liminf_{n\to\infty}|f_n -f|\\
&\leq \liminf_{n\to\infty}\int_a^b|f_n -f| = 0,
\end{align} where the second inequality follows from Fatou's lemma and the last step from the assumption that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\int_a^b|f_n-f| = 0$ . We conclude that $|g-f| = 0$ a.e.. Is this the correct direction to approach the exercise? I don't see how to go from the above result to showing that $f=g$ a.e..

4212158,Method of Moments estimation,"I am sorry in advance if this question seems like low effort, but I really do not know how to solve this problem. My understanding of method of moments estimation is bad. Here is the definition of method of moments estimation in my book: Let $\{X_1,X_2,...,X_n\}$ be a random sample from a population $F(x;\theta)$ . Suppose $\theta$ has $p$ components (for example, for a normal popoulation $N(\mu, \sigma^2),p=2$ ; for Poisson population with parameter $\lambda$ , $p=1$ ). Let $$\mu_k=\mu_k(\theta)=E(X^k)$$ denote the kth population moment, for k=1,2,... Therefore, $\mu_k$ depends on the unknown parapemter $\theta$ , as everything else about the distribution $F(x;\theta)$ is known. Denote the $k$ th sample moment by: $$M_k=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X_i^k=\frac{X_1^k+X_2^k+...+X_n^k}{n}.$$ The MM estimator (MME) $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ is the solution of the $p$ equations $$\mu_k(\hat{\theta})=M_k \text{ for } k=1,2,...,p$$ So my problem I am struggling to solve is the following: An economist decides to model the distribution of income in a  country with the probability density function: $$f_x(x;\alpha,k)=\frac{\alpha k^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha+1}} \text{ for } x\geq k$$ and $0$ otherwise, where $k>0$ and $\alpha >2$ . Let $\{X_1,X_2,...,X_n\}$ be a random sample of size $n$ from this distribution. You may use the fact that: $$E(X)=\frac{\alpha k}{\alpha-1} \text{ and } E(X^2)=\frac{\alpha k^2}{\alpha-2}$$ Show that the method of moments estimators of $\alpha$ and $k$ are the solutions of: $$\frac{1}{\hat{\alpha}(\hat{\alpha}-2)}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)\frac{S^2}{\overline{X}^2} \text{ and } \hat{k}=\frac{(\hat{\alpha}-1)\overline{X}}{\hat{\alpha}}$$ where: $$\overline{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X_i\text{ and } S^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(X_i-\overline{X})^2$$ My attempt to solve this: We have that $\mu_1(\alpha,k)=\frac{\alpha k}{\alpha-1}$ , $\mu_2(\alpha,k)=\frac{\alpha k^2}{\alpha - 2}$ So we have to solve the following equations: $$\mu_1(\alpha,k)=M_1 \text{ and } \mu_2(\alpha,k)=M_2$$ We have that $$\mu_1(\alpha,k)=M_1\Rightarrow \frac{\alpha k }{\alpha-1}=\overline{X}$$ Now, $$\mu_2(\alpha,k)=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i\Rightarrow \frac{\alpha k^2}{\alpha-2}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i$$ So from the first equation we have that $$\frac{\alpha k}{\overline{X}}-1=\alpha-2$$ Plugging $\alpha-2$ into the first equation we get $$\frac{\alpha k^2}{\frac{\alpha k}{\overline{X}}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i\Leftrightarrow k\overline{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i\Leftrightarrow \hat{k}=\frac{1}{\overline{X}}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i$$ Now I'd like to find $\hat{\alpha}$ . So for $k$ we plug in $\hat{k}$ (in equation $\mu_1(\alpha,k)=M_2$ ): $$\frac{\alpha k}{\alpha -1}=\overline{X}\Leftrightarrow \frac{alpha\frac{1}{n\overline{X}}\sum^n_{i=1}X^2_i}{\alpha-1}=\overline{X}\Leftrightarrow \frac{alpha \sum X^2_i}{n\overline{X}(\alpha-1)}=\overline{X}\Leftrightarrow \alpha = \frac{(\alpha-1)n\overline{X}^2}{\sum X_i^2}\text{ this is equation (1) }$$ Now we plug in $\hat{k}$ in the equation $\mu_2(\alpha,k)=M_2$ : $$\frac{\alpha k^2}{\alpha-2}=\sum X_i^2\Leftrightarrow \frac{\alpha\frac{1}{\left(n\overline{X}\right)^2}\left(\sum X^2_i\right)^2}{\alpha-2}=\sum X^2_i \Leftrightarrow \alpha = \frac{\left(n\overline{X}\right)^2(\alpha-2)}{\sum X^2_i} \text{ this is equation (2) for alpha }$$ Equating the 2 equations of $\alpha$ and solving for $\alpha$ : $$\frac{\left(n\overline{X}\right)^2(\alpha-2)}{\sum X_i^2}=\frac{(\alpha-1)n \overline{X}^2}{\sum X^2_i}$$ $$\Leftrightarrow (\left(n\overline{X}\right)^2(\alpha-2)=n\overline{X}^2(\alpha-1)\Leftrightarrow $$ $$\alpha\left(\left(n\overline{X}\right)^2-n\overline{X}^2\right)=2(n\overline{X}^2-n\overline{X}^2\Leftrightarrow \hat{\alpha}=\frac{2n-1}{n-1}$$ Well now that I have these, I don't know how they are the solutions of $$\frac{1}{\hat{\alpha}(\hat{\alpha}-2)}=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)\frac{S^2}{\overline{X}^2} \text{ and } \hat{k}=\frac{(\hat{\alpha}-1)\overline{X}}{\hat{\alpha}}$$ Did I solve for the estimators correctly?

If this is true, is this property unique to $\mod 4$ ? Motivation: I came across this post here today, and this problem is the generalized case. I have posted a solution via brute-force for the linked question, for the $n=3$ case, where it holds. But my approach provided no insight for a general solution, which would be more interesting to me. Attempt: I tried to come up with an alternative solution for the $n=3$ case itself, hoping that perhaps that would be useful for a generalization. But even this I couldn't finish. Here is my attempt: $$a+b+c=w+z+y {\tag 3}$$ and $$ab+bc+ac=wz+wy+zy {\tag 4}$$ We wish to arrive at $$abc \equiv wyz \mod 4$$ Squaring $(3)$ and using $(4)$ allows us to arrive at $a^2+b^2+c^2=w^2+z^2+y^2$ .
This means that $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc= w^3+y^3+z^3-3wyz$ Hence, if I could show that $$\sum a^3 \equiv \sum w^3 \mod 4$$ our problem is finished. But this is where I got stuck. Edit: Although I could make no further advances on the problem, a more interesting reformulation of the problem might be note-worthy-
The conjecture is that any $n$ degree polynomial with $n$ integer roots, if after translation along the $y$ axis gives a polynomial which again has $n$ integer roots, then we must have shifted the original polynomial by $4k$ units, $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ .

4212258,On well-definedness of Shimura curve.,"Suppose that we have a quaternion algebra $D$ over a totally real number field $K$ such that $[K \colon {\Bbb Q}] = {\mathrm{odd}}$ . We assume that $D$ splits everywhere at finite places of $K$ and at one infinite place of $K$ . (Hence, $D$ is ramified at $[K \colon {\Bbb Q}] -1$ infinite places.) Suppose we have an Eichler ordre ${\cal O}_N$ of level $N$ in $D$ . ${\cal O}_N$ is defined as the intersection of two maximal ordres of $D$ and level $N$ is defined as the index of ${\cal O}_N$ in any maximal ordre which contains ${\cal O}_N$ . We shall fix one isomorphism $\phi \colon D \otimes_{\Bbb Q} {\Bbb R} \cong M_2({\Bbb R})$ . Take ${\cal O}_N^{(1)} \subset {\cal O}_N$ which consists of norm $1$ elements. Q. Is Shimura curve $C \colon = {\Bbb H}/{\cal O}_N^{(1)*}$ well-defined? That is, ${\cal O}_N$ is defined uniquely up to conjugate in $D$ ? I.e., type number of ${\cal O}_N$ is one. By the way, I have learned that $C$ is actually well-defined as follows: Shimura curve over ${\Bbb C}$ is just a quotient space $C \colon= D^* \backslash D_A^*/\widehat{{\cal O}_N}^*F_{\infty}^*C$ for a maximal compact subgroup $C$ . So it is a union of $a \widehat{{\cal O}_N} a^{-1} \cap D^* \backslash {\Bbb H}$ for  a running over a complete representative set of $D^* \backslash D_A^*/{\widehat{R}}^*D_{\infty}^*$ . That is, all adelic conjugacy classes of ${\cal O}_N$ appears once. I cannot very well understand this explanation, although I know it is correct. My biggest question is that when one speaks of uniformisation, one must once and for all choose arithmetic Fuchsian group up to conjugacy. Hence the uniquness of Eichler ordre ${\cal O}_N$ in $D$ must be ensured somehow in ordre to give the precise definition of Shimura curve for our quaternion algebra.","['algebraic-curves', 'complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'division-algebras', 'arithmetic-geometry']"

4212364,Representations of an algebraic group $G$ versus representations of the group $G(k)$,"The following question stems from the discussion here . Let $G$ be a group scheme, $G$ acting on a vector space $V$ over a field $k$ is morphism of group valued functors $G \rightarrow GL_V$ , where $GL_V$ is the functor on commutative $k$ -algebras defined by: $$
R \mapsto \text{Aut}_{R-\text{Mod}}(V\otimes_k R)
$$ This is I believe a standard definition and is used by J.S. Milne in his book on algebraic groups . Consider the case when $G$ is actually a variety, over an algebraically closed field $k$ , say an affine or quasi-projective one. Then from a geometry perspective I can think of $G$ as being it's set of $k$ points like chapter 1 of Hartshorne and $G(k)$ is just an abstract group, but when $G$ has coordinates then $G(k)$ is defined by polynomials and the group operations are given by regular functions. Lets say $G(k)$ acts on some vector space. When is this equivalent to the scheme theoretic notion above? Example when these notions don't allign even though they might seem to is the following. Any $G$ rep in the scheme theoretic sense is an increasing union of finite dimensional reps, it's ""rational"", this is corollary 4.7, page 71, of in J.S. Milne's notes linked above. But consider the case of $(\mathbb{C},+)$ , (the $\mathbb{C}$ points of $\mathbb{G}_a$ ) acting  on $\mathbb{C}(t)$ . Where $g\cdot f(t)=f(t+g)$ . Then the $G$ -submodule spanned by $1/t$ is infinite dimensional. Meaning that this representation is not something that comes out of a $\mathbb{C}[t]$ -codmodule structure like group scheme theoretic rep of $\mathbb{G}_a$ over $\mathbb{C}$ would. So given a rep of $G(k)$ how do I know it's the same as the $k$ -points of some a scheme theoretic rep, $G\rightarrow GL_V$ I'm especially interested in the case of an affine algebraic group $G$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ acting on a variety and thus $G(k)$ acting it's field of rational functions $k(G)$ . Edit: Note that in the finite dimensional case if $G$ is quasi-projective and $k$ is algebraically closed then $G(k)$ -reps as an abstract group which are defined by polynomial equations are the same as scheme theoretic maps $G\rightarrow GL_n$ , because maps of varieties in the sense of Hartshorne chapter 1 are equivalent to schemes maps. So in particular this question is of interest when the representation is infinite dimensional. Edit: The lack of the word ""acting"" in $G(k)$ acting on it's field of rational functions $k(G)$ was corrected. I also added a definition for $GL_V$ when $V$ is infinite dimensional.","['algebraic-groups', 'reductive-groups', 'representation-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'group-theory']"

4212441,How to find a point on the perimeter of a square?,"Given the four corners $(x, y)$ of a square, the center $(x, y)$ , and a starting direction (ex: $45^\circ$ ) around a $360^\circ$ rotation ( $0^\circ/360^\circ$ at the top), how do you find out the intercept on the perimeter as the direction is incrementally stepped? What I'm basically doing is taking a circle of radius $(r)$ , determining it's area $(A)$ , converting that to length $(L)$ of the sides of the square, and then determining the corners $(x, y)$ given the starting center point and the above described direction. This allows for the square to rotate it's starting position depending on the direction. I used the equations below to determine the corners (assuming $(x, y)$ is the center of the circle): $$\left(x - \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) - \cos(\text{rotation})), y + \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) + \cos(\text{rotation}))\right)$$ $$\left(x + \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) + \cos(\text{rotation})), y + \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) - \cos(\text{rotation}))\right)$$ $$\left(x + \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) - \cos(\text{rotation})), y - \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) + \cos(\text{rotation}))\right)$$ $$\left(x - \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) + \cos(\text{rotation})), y - \frac{L}{2} * (\sin(\text{rotation}) - \cos(\text{rotation}))\right)$$","['elementary-functions', 'trigonometry', 'geometry', 'parametric']"

4212530,Are lower bounds for set systems with restricted intersection known in special cases?,"Consider $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ . Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of subsets of $[n]$ such that every set in $\mathcal{F}$ has exactly $k$ elements and for any $A,B \in \mathcal{F}$ with $A \neq B$ , $|A \cap B| \leq r$ . Denote the largest possible value of $|\mathcal{F}|$ by $m(n,k,r)$ . I'm interested in the special case when $k=2k' \leq \frac{n}{2}$ and $r = k'-1$ . My main question is as follows. What are some good lower bounds for $m(n,2k',k'-1)$ with $k' \geq 3$ ? Can it be exactly determined in any cases? Some related questions and results are mentioned below. In the case $k'=2$ , this boils down to evaluating $m(n,4,1)$ which is equivalent to the $K_4$ -packing number of $K_n$ . This was determined exactly in the paper 'Optimal packing of $K_4$ 's into a $K_n$ ' by A.E Brouwer in 1979. As noted in this question which links to this paper , the general case is equivalent to finding a lower bound on the maximum number of binary codewords of length $n$ and weight $k$ such that the Hamming distance between any two codewords is at least $2k-r$ . Adapting the notation in the paper, I want a lower bound on $A(n,2k-r,k)$ . Theorems 4 and 7 do provide some lower bounds but it seems to me that the argument only works if $2k-r$ is even. Moreover, I am interested in the case $A(n,2k-r,k) = A(n,3k'+1,2k')$ and was wondering if you can somehow obtain stronger bounds in this case. (Note that in my case, the results from the paper seem to apply only if $3k'+1$ is even, or equivalently if $k'$ is odd). This question is also related and provides a nice lower bound attributed to Frenkl, but I could not find a reference to the original statement of this theorem despite some digging around. The paper 'On a  Packing and Covering Problem' by Rödl provides the asymptotic behavior of $m(n,k,r+1)$ (Warning: there is some difference in notation regarding $r$ and $r+1$ ). Statements such as 'the lower bound holds for sufficiently large $n$ ' are not helpful to me unless I know what this large $n$ is. Apologies for the lengthy question! Thank you.","['coding-theory', 'combinatorics', 'extremal-combinatorics']"

So, I tried both the one-dimensional mean-value theorem and the $n$ -dimensional mean value theorem. I always get $$|e^{\dot{\imath}x\cdot y}-1|\leq c|y||x|$$ Here are the details: Apply $1$ -dimensional the mean value theorem to the smooth function $f(t)= e^{\dot{\imath}t}$ on $[0,x\cdot y]$ if $x\cdot y>0$ 0r the integral $[x\cdot y,0]$ of $x\cdot y<0$ . We get $$|f(t)-f(0)|=|e^{\dot{\imath}x\cdot y}-1|=|t|=|x\cdot y|\leq |x||y|.$$ Now, apply the $n$ -dimensional the mean value theorem to the smooth function $f(y)= e^{\dot{\imath}y\cdot x}$ on the line segment $\lambda y+(1-\lambda)0$ , $\lambda\in [0,1]$ . We have $\nabla_{y}f(y)=\dot{\imath} x e^{\dot{\imath}y\cdot x}.$ So $$|e^{\dot{\imath}y\cdot x}-1|=\lambda |y||x|.\qquad (1)$$ If one regards $ e^{\dot{\imath}y\cdot x} $ as a function of $x$ in stead, and use $n$ -dimensional the mean value theorem on the line segment $\lambda x+(1-\lambda)0$ we also get (1) by symmetry.

4212681,Convergence of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\sin (\sin n))^n$,"I'm studying this series: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (\sin (\sin n))^n$$ which apparently converges (according to the solutions at the end of the book). I haven't yet learned derivatives or integrals (or L'Hopital rule); I've only learned criteria to determine if a series with only positive terms is convergent or divergent. I have two problems with this exercises: It does not look to me that the series has only positive terms (e.g. $n=5$ yields a negative term) so none of my tests for convergence could be applied I'm unable to compute the limit of the sequence as $n \to \infty$ , which is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the series to converge With regards to the limit, I can definitely do $\lim_\limits{n\to\infty} \sin (\sin n)$ which is indeterminate, it is unclear to me why adding a power of $n$ makes the limit go to 0 and I have been unable to prove it. So two questions: hints to prove the limit, and confirm my theory that this is not a series of positive terms. I spent a considerable amount of time on this series (and the respective limit) and I feel that I have exausted the limits of my knowledge at this point.","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series']"
