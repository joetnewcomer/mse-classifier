477235,Extending primes,"This question is more of a curiosity than anything. Start with a prime number and consider concatenating digits onto the right hand side. Sometimes you can make a prime and continue the process making bigger primes but this process always ends.

477253,$1^k+2^k+\cdots+n^k\mod n$ where $n=p^a$.,"My friend said that for any $n=p^a$, where $p$ is odd prime , $a$ is positive integer then: If $k$ is divisible by $p-1$ then $1^k+2^k+\cdots+n^k\equiv -p^{a-1}\pmod{p^a}$.  I am very sure that his result is wrong. My though is simple: I use primitive root of $p^a$. But I fail to construct a counterexample for him. So my question is that: Could we construct an example of  $k$ so that $p-1\mid k$ and $1^k+2^k+\cdots+n^k\not\equiv -p^{a-1}\pmod{p^a}$.

477297,Calculate $\tan(1+i)$,"Calculate $\tan(1+i)$. I use the expression $\tan x = -i\dfrac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}$. So it only remains to calculate $e^{i(1+i)}$ (and then $e^{-i(1+i)}$ follows by taking the reciprocal). So $e^{i(1+i)} = e^ie^{ii} = e^i/e$. For $e^i$ I use the formula $e^x = 1+x+\dfrac{x^2}{2!}+\ldots$, so $$e^i = 1+i-\dfrac{1}{2!}-\dfrac{i}{3!}+\dfrac{1}{4!} = \left(1-\dfrac{1}{2!}+\dfrac{1}{4!}-\ldots\right)+i\left(1-\dfrac{1}{3!}+\dfrac{1}{5!}-\ldots\right)$$ and there's probably no way to calculate that except say that it's equal to $\cos 1+i\sin 1$. So $e^i/e = (\cos 1+i\sin 1)/e$, and $e/e^i = e/(\cos 1+i\sin 1)$. This seems to yield a very ugly expression for the original $\tan(1+i)$.

($x$ can be assumed to be large enough that edge effects are negligible.) I assume this is a standard problem and has a name but I don't know it. It's related to the birthday problem, a discrete version of this problem, and also to Rényi's parking problem which disallows overlap rather than measuring it. I suppose there are at least two ways to measure overlap: the total length of the interval covered by more than one stick, or the same weighted by the number of sticks, less 1, at that point. The second is slightly more natural in my application, but I'd be happy with either. Edit: I found Comparing Continuous and Discrete Birthday Coincidences: “Same-Day” versus “Within 24 Hours” (2010) which discusses finding the probability of any overlap in my model, rather than the expected length of the overlap.","['statistics', 'probability-theory', 'analysis']"

I found this relational expression by using computer. Then, I got interested in the generalization of this expression. After receiving an answer, I decided to start an easy example. First, I got the following with a proof:
$$\lfloor\sqrt n+\sqrt {n+1}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt {4n+1}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{4n+2}\rfloor.$$ Note that $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the largest integer not greater than $x$. Proof : By the AM-GM inequality, we get $n\lt\sqrt{n(n+1)}\lt n+1/2$. Then, we get
$$4n+1\lt\left(\sqrt n+\sqrt{n+1}\right)^2=4n+2-2\left(n+1/2-\sqrt{n(n+1)}\right)\lt4n+2.
$$
By the way, there are no perfect squares in $\left(4n+1, 4n+2\right].$ (since $k^2\equiv0, 1(mod 4)$ for any natural number $k$, there is no natural number $k$ such that $k^2=4n+2$.) Now, the proof is completed. Second, I've just got new relational expressions by using computer:
$$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{9n+8}\rfloor,$$
$$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}+\sqrt{n+3}\rfloor=\lfloor\sqrt{16n+20}\rfloor$$
for any natural numbre $n$. I won't ask these expression because I'm going to prove these by myself. Third, I haven't got any expression about 'six terms expression'.
Then, I expect the following theorem would be proven true: Theorem : For any real number $c$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that
$$\lfloor\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{n+1}+\sqrt{n+2}+\sqrt{n+3}+\sqrt{n+4}+\sqrt{n+5}\rfloor\not=\lfloor\sqrt{36n+c}\rfloor.$$ Then, here is my question. Question : The theorem I wrote is true?

If $(f \circ g)(a)=(f \circ g)(b)$, then $f(g(a))=f(g(b))$.  Since $f$ is one-to-one, we know that $g(a)=g(b)$.  And, since $g$ is one-to-one is must be that $a=b$.  Hence $f \circ g$ is one-to-one. (b) Since $f$ is surjective we know that for all $c \in C$ there is a $b\in B$ such that $f(b)=c$.  Since $g$ is surjective, there is a $a \in A$ such that $g(a)=b$.  Hence, for all $c \in C$ there is an $a \in A$ such that $(f \circ g)(a)=f(g(a))=f(b)=c$. (c)  This is false.  Let $A=\{1\}$, $B=\{1,2\}$, and $C=\{1\}$. Define $g(1)=1$ and $f(1)=f(2)=1$. Then $f \circ g$ is injective, but $f$ is not injective. (d)  This is true.  Let $a,b \in A$ where $a \neq b$.  If $(f\circ g)(a)\neq(f\circ g)(b)$, then $f(g(a))\neq f(g(b))$.  Hence $g(a) \neq g(b)$. (e)  Since $f \circ g$ is surjective, then for every $ c \in C$ there is an $a \in A$ such that $f(g(a))=c$.   Let $b = g(a)$.  Then $b \in B$ and $f(b)=g(f(a))=c$.  Thus $f(b)=c$.  Hence $f$ is surjective.

Now, we can see that this is isomorphic to $M_2(K)$, the matrix ring, where the isomorphism is given by $$j_1 \rightarrow \pmatrix{0 & -4 \\ 1 & 0},$$ $$i_1 \rightarrow \pmatrix{1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 }.$$
Call $\psi$ the isomorphism $(1,-4)_K \rightarrow M_2(K)$. 
Now, we can see that as a quaternion algebra, $(1,-4)_K \cong (1,1)$ ( call the generators here for $i_2$ , $j_2$) by the isomorphism
$$i_1 \rightarrow i_2,$$
$$j_1 \rightarrow j_2(1+i_2)$$

$\sigma:(1,1)_K \rightarrow M_2(K)$ be the isomorphism (which is of the same ""form"" as $\psi$). Now, this induces an automorphism:
$\sigma \circ \phi \circ \psi^{-1}: M_2(K) \rightarrow M_2(K)$, which takes 
$$e= \pmatrix{1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 }$$ onto itself and takes $$f= \pmatrix{0 & -4 \\ 1 & 0}$$ onto $\sigma(j(1+i))$. Now, I can not get this to be an inner automorphism!

$$\sigma(j(i+1))= \sigma(j)\sigma(i+1) = \pmatrix{0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 } [ \pmatrix{1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 } + \pmatrix{1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1}].$$ Multiplying this, I get $$\pmatrix{ 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 0 }.$$ So if we assume that we have an inner automorphism: we should have
$$\pmatrix{a & 0 \\ 0 & b } \pmatrix{0 & -4 \\ 1 & 0 } = \pmatrix{0 & 0 \\ 2 & 0} \pmatrix{a & 0 \\ 0 & b}$$ but this can not hold! So, some of my assumptions should be wrong, or some step, but I really can't see which one. I suspect that it lies in the step where I multiply by a norm. But it should hold, but maybe my isomorphism isn't an isomorphism. But there should be one, and I am quite sure that that one is correct!","['noncommutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
477534,Counting Question,"Been wrestling with the following counting question for about an hour. I will explain my reasoning for counting in the question and I request any BETTER WAY to make this calculation or corrections if my counting is wrong. ""If each coded item in a catalog begins with 3 distinct letters followed by 4 distinct   nonzero digits, find the probability of randomly selecting one of these coded items with the first letter a vowel and the last digit even."" I first calculate the sample space: 26 * 25 * 24 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6
= 47,174,400 This is done using the simple ""placeholder"" technique for counting. Now I must calculate the special case such that the first letter is a vowel and the last digit even. The ""placeholder"" technique confuses me here. 5 * 25 * 24 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 4 = 6,048,000 So probability  is 6048000/47,174,400. I can't  help but think this is wrong. What about the case where the code has a vowel BEFORE the last vowel, for example. Does this not make the calculation the following: 5 * 25 * 24 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 3 Because one vowel has already been seleccted BEFORE the last vowel... there are fewer choices. Should I need to add up all the permutations in which there is a vowel previous to the last vowel?

I need to show that $G$ is abelian. My attempt: Let $\sim$ be a relation defined on $G$ as follows:
For $x,y\in G$, we write $x\sim y$ iff $x=\phi(y)$ or $x=y$. Then $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $G$ with each equivalence class containing $2$ elements except for the equivalence class of $e$ which has just $1$ element. So $|G|$ is odd. Another observation is that if $\phi(x)=y$ then $\phi(xy)=yx$.

In fact if $\phi$ sends each element to its inverse then it easily follows that $G$ is abelian. Any help is greatly appreciated. Please try to give insights as to how you arrived at your solution.

477696,Finding domain of a rational function,"Find the domain and graph: $$f(t)=\frac{-t}{|t|}$$ My book says to define it piecewise. My questions: $\mathbf{1)}$ Do all rational functions have to be defined piecewise, or just this one because there is an absolute value in the denominator, and the absolute value is always defined piecewise? $\mathbf{2)}$ Are all rational functions defined piecewise in order to avoid having a denominator be equal to zero, is that the general reason for defining anything piecewise, to avoid having division by zero? (so then this would mean that the domain of a rational function is always defined piecewise, or only when we need to avoid having denominator be $=0$?) This is how my book defines $f(t)$ piecewise: If $t>0$, then $|t|$ is $t$ since $t$ is already positive. For $t>0$, simplify $$f(t)=\frac{-t}{|t|} = \frac{-t}{t}=-1$$ If $t<0$, then $|t|$ is $-t$ since $t$ is negative. For $t<0$, simplify $$f(t)=\frac{-t}{-|t|} = \frac{-t}{-t}=1$$ (or for the last part, should the negative be inside the absolute value sign for $t<0$, as in $|-t|$ instead of $-|t|$?) So we define it piecewise to avoid having $0$ in the denominator? Because isn't absolute value defined at $0$, the absolute value is continuous everywhere, and thus defined at $0$? I'm confused about defining things piecewise, and how to know when to apply a piecewise attempt in order to define a function's domain. Also, I'm confused about the second part of this, where $t<0$ for $|t|$. How is it that here, $|t|$ is $-t$ if absolute value is always positive? Maybe I'm not understanding the absolute value concept correctly, because in grade school it has always been drilled into my head that |absolute value| just ""turns things positive"", so here I don't really understand how it can be negative. I understand how the domain is $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$, because by using open intervals we're not letting it be exactly $=0$, but I'm confused about the whole piecewise thing.","['absolute-value', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'self-learning', 'functions']"

Because, an open interval would allow a left and right limit to exist since the limit can approach from both sides, correct? Because for any point that is in an open interval, you can always mark off a little interval around it where that interval is still within the original open interval. So for any point in a given open interval, we have a little ""space"" on either side for our left and right limits to form. But endpoints on $[a,b]$ cannot be approached from both sides, so a function defined on this interval is right-continuous at $a$ and left-continuous at $b$ and has only one-sided limits at endpoints $a$ and $b$ ? So then a function on $[a,b]$ has only one-sided continuity, correct? Because how can an endpoint $a$ be approached from the left since it's an $endpoint$ , it could only make the function right-continuous, not totally continuous. And a derivative is usually defined on some differentiable interval $(a,b)$ , but it could also be differentiable on a closed interval $[a,b]$ , but in this case it would be a one-sided derivative, correct? Why is continuity defined mostly on closed intervals, when closed intervals mean that it is only continuous from one-side, and open intervals mean that it's both right-continuous and left-continuous and hence has total continuity?","['calculus', 'self-learning', 'continuity', 'derivatives', 'limits']"

Let $\epsilon > 0 $ be arbitrary, we seek to find $\delta$ such that $\forall x,y \in [0,1]$, $|x-y|<\delta \Longrightarrow |x\sin{\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}- y\sin{\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)}|<\epsilon$ SCRATCHWORK \begin{align*}

& t\sin{\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)} = - \frac{2}{\pi(4k+3)}  \text{    is true for   } t =\frac{2}{\pi(4k+3)}

&\text{distance}\left(f_1\left(\frac{2}{\pi(4k+1)}\right), f_1\left(\frac{2}{\pi(4k+3)}\right)\right) = \\
& \frac{2}{\pi(4k+1)} - \left(- \frac{2}{\pi(4k+3)} \right) =\\

& \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)\frac{4k+2}{(4k+1)(4k+3)}

Define $\epsilon(k) = $ such $k$ so that 
$$
\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)\frac{4k+2}{(4k+1)(4k+3)} < \epsilon 
$$ So as long as $\delta = \frac{2}{\pi(4\epsilon(k)+1)} - \frac{2}{\pi(4\epsilon(k)+3)}= \frac{4}{\pi(4\epsilon(k)+1)(4\epsilon(k)+3)}$

I think the answer is yes and I've supplied the following proof: let $\alpha \subset W$ be a basis of the subspace. Since there's an isomorphism $\phi : W \to V$ and since isomorphisms transforms basis into basis, we know that $\phi(\alpha)\subset V$ is a basis of $V$ and that $\phi | \alpha : \alpha \to \phi(\alpha)$ is a bijection between those bases as sets. Now, we know from the proof that every vector space has a basis that we can produce a basis for $V$ from the set $\alpha$. In that case, let $\beta$ be that basis. We know that any two basis of $V$ has the same cardinality and we know that $\alpha \subset \beta$ and that $|\alpha| = |\phi(\alpha)|$ (because $\phi$ is a bijection between those) and we know that $|\phi(\alpha)| = |\beta|$ because those two are basis of $V$. Hence, the set $\beta$ has the same cardinality as it's proper subset $\alpha$ (which we know to be proper because $W$ is a proper subspace).

478349,Computing bicharacters of (small) finite groups,"I'm trying to find some finite groups with certain properites (hopefully of small order; no more than 100, I suspect), and one of the things I need to look at are all of its bilinear bicharacters: maps $G\times G \to \mathbb{C}^*$ where fixing any one coordinate yields a linear character of G. For example, if $G$ is the symmetric group $S_n$, then there are two bicharacters: the trivial one (all values are 1); and the one defined to be -1 when both inputs are odd, and 1 otherwise. Are there any computationally efficient ways of computing all such bicharacters?  I'm fairly proficient with using Mathematica, but I'm currently pretty unfamiliar with other systems, like GAP and Magma.  If the others are better for this purpose, I'm fine with learning how to use them, especially if I can easily convert answers to Mathematica code (the bicharacters are just one part of a bigger picture that I'm currently handling with Mathematica).  You may suppose I already know the irreducible linear characters of $G$ (my understanding is that these are easy to get with systems like GAP). EDIT: It is probably worth pointing out that I need to know the bicharacters explicitly, and not up to isomorphism.  I need to perform computations involving them and other pieces of data.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'characters']"
478350,On the definition of the exponential map,"The exponential map on a manifold $M$ is defined at a point $ p\in T_p(M)$ as $$exp_p:T_p(M)\rightarrow M \\ exp_p(v)=\gamma_v(1) $$ where $\gamma_v$ is the constant speed geodesic with initial velocity as $v$ Can anyone please tell me what the existence of an affine connection has to do with this definition and also why is the curve's value taken at the point 1? The latter probably has a simple answer, if so a hint would suffice.","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"
478365,Showing that the product of vector magnitudes is larger than their dot product,"QUESTION Show that $$|\mathtt{u} \cdot \mathtt v| \le |\mathtt u||\mathtt v|$$ ATTEMPT Let $ \mathtt {u,v} \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $ \mathtt u = u_1 x_1 + u_2 x_2 + ... + u_n x_n, \mathtt v = v_1 x_1 + v_2 x_2 + ... + v_n x_n$ Then  $$|\mathtt{u} \cdot \mathtt v| = | u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + ... + u_n v_n | $$
$$ |\mathtt u||\mathtt v| = \sqrt{ {u_1}^2 + {u_2}^2 + ... + {u_n}^2}\sqrt{ {v_1}^2 + {v_2}^2 + ... + {v_n}^2}  $$ This is where I get a bit stuck. Instinctively I do know that (2) is in fact larger or equal to (1). I'm just not sure which lemma/theorem/rule to use to show this.

478382,left inverse is not equal to right inverse [duplicate],This question already has an answer here : Right and left inverse (1 answer) Closed 10 years ago . Is it possible to have a function which has both left and right inverse but they are unequal ? A left inverse means the function should be one-to-one whereas a right inverse means the function should be onto. How can both of these conditions be valid simultaneously without being equal ? An example will be really helpful. Thanks in advance,"['inverse', 'functions']"
