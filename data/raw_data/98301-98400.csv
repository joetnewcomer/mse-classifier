1357994,$(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ independent Cauchy-distributed random variables. Convergence of $n^{-\gamma}(X_1+\cdots+X_n)$,"I want to solve the following exercise but i am unsure if my ideas are correct or not. Let $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ be i.i.d. random variables with probability density 
$$
f_a(x)=\frac{1}{a\pi}\frac{1}{1+(x/a)^2},
$$ i.e. each $X_n$ is Cauchy-distributed. a) For which $\gamma$ does $n^{-\gamma}(X_1 + \cdots + X_n)$ converge in distribution? b) Does $( n^{-1}(X_1 + \dots + X_n) )_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converge almost surely? If not, why not? My ideas so far: a) Define $S_n:=X_1 + \dots + X_n$. Because of the $X_i$'s independency $S_n$ is Cauchy-distributed with parameter $na$. I tried to use Lévy's continuity theorem and characteristic functions.
The characteristic function of $S_n$ is $\varphi_{S_n}(t) = e^{-na|t|}$ and the characteristic function of $n^{-\gamma}S_n$ is $\varphi_n(t):=\varphi_{n^{-\gamma}S_n}(t) = e^{-n^{1-\gamma} |t|}$. Now i look at several cases: Let $\gamma = 1$. Then $\varphi_n(t) = e^{-|t|}$ and thus $n^{-1}S_n$ is Cauchy-distributed with parameter $1$ (independent of $n$) which implies that the sequence converges in distribution. Now let $\gamma > 1$. Then 
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \varphi_n (t) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} e^{-n^{1-\gamma} |t|} \underset{1-\gamma < 0}{=} 1
$$
for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
I'm not sure about this though. What kind of distribution has a constant characteristic function? Based on my knowledge about Fourier transform i guess that this has something to do with the Dirac-Delta. Finally let $\gamma < 1$. Then
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \varphi_n(0) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} e^0 = 1
$$
and for $t\neq 0$
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \varphi_n(t) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} e^{-n^{1-\gamma} |t|} \underset{1-\gamma > 0}{=} 0.
$$ The characteristic function converges point-wise but the limit function isn't continuous at $0$ and by Lévy's continuity theorem we conclude that the sequence doesn't converge in distribution. Now part b):
My intuiion says that the sequence ($n^{-1} S_n$ is the arithmetic mean) does not converge and that it has something to do with the fact that a Cauchy-distributed random variable does not have an expected value.

1357997,Accumulation points of sets,"Determine all of the accumulation points of the following sets in $\mathbb{R}^1$ and decide whether the sets are open or closed or neither. I have two problems with the following problems first of all consider the following set $S = \left\{\frac{1}{m}: m \in \mathbb{N}\right\}$ I have already proved $0$ is accumulation point. My claim is that $0$ is the only accumulation point. I came with the following claim: suppose the only interval that could cause problems is $(0,1)$ (I have already proved that points outside of $(0,1)$ can't be accumulation points). So, let $y \in (0,1)$ let $m$ be the smallest $m$ such that $y \geq \frac{1}{m}$.  My claim is that $r := y - \frac{1}{m}$. If we use such $r$ according to my intuition then $(B(y,r) - {y})\cap S = \emptyset$, however I can't prove it, so maybe it is wrong. I am proving only using point-set topology. So I have decided to edit the question to show the proof that I think is fully rigorous maybe it would benefit people in the future:
Proof: Let m be the smallest integer such that $y > \frac{1}{m}$ Consider $r := min(y - \frac{1}{m},\frac{1}{m - 1} - y)$ One thing we must clarify here is that we can't have by definition the following that $\frac{1}{m - 1} < y$ according to how I defined my m to be. Suppose $r = y - \frac{1}{m} \implies B(y,r) = (\frac{1}{m},2y - \frac{1}{m})$. Now I will get a contradiction by supposing that $\frac{1}{q} \in (\frac{1}{m},2y - \frac{1}{m})$. This means that $\frac{1}{q} > \frac{1}{m} \& \frac{1}{q} < 2y - \frac{1}{m - 1}$, however by hypothesis we have $min(y - \frac{1}{m},\frac{1}{m - 1} - y) = y - \frac{1}{m} \implies y - \frac{1}{m} < \frac{1}{m - 1} - y \implies 2y - \frac{1}{m} < \frac{1}{m - 1} \implies \frac{1}{q} <  2y - \frac{1}{m - 1} < \frac{1}{m - 1}$ So $q$ must be less than $\frac{1}{m}$ which is contradiction by construction that is from the fact that $m$ is the smallest integer such that $y > \frac{1}{m}$","['real-analysis', 'general-topology']"

1358012,Combinatorics: How many ways are there to distribute zero to thirteen distinct cards to four distinct players?,"Other ways to word the question so that it's clear: In a game where players hold a maximum of thirteen cards and a minimum of zero cards, how many possible positions are there? How many possible Tien Len (Vietnamese Poker, Thirteen) positions are there? If a person is holding 52 distinct cards and 52 identical cards, how many ways can this person give thirteen cards to player one, thirteen cards to player two, thirteen cards to player three, and thirteen cards to player four, where players are distinct? This is not my homework, but I am interested in the combinatorics that would go into solving this problem. I've figured out how to solve the problem when each player must have exactly thirteen cards. It's just ${52 \choose 13} {39 \choose 13} {26 \choose 13} {13 \choose 13}$. However, allowing players to have less than 13 cards makes it more complicated. I'd appreciate any help. Thanks. EDIT: I realized that I wasn't clear in my question. In some places I wrote that each player has a minimum of one card, where in others I wrote that the player has a minimum of zero cards.

Since $2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot8\cdot10\cdots = 2^n\cdot n!$ , we can say $$f(n)=\sqrt[n]{\left\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \right\rfloor !\cdot2^{\lfloor n/3 \rfloor + 1}}$$ And since the floor function doesn't matter much on a larger scale, and to be more consistent with the $\frac{n}3+1$ , we can essentially rewrite the function as $$f(n)=\sqrt[n]{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{3}+1\right)\cdot2^{n/3+ 1}}$$ After graphing this function and reading a list of identities of the gamma function I could not simplify this, even though the graph looks fairly straightfoward.
My question is, is there a simpler, or perhaps constant $g(n)$ where $$\lim_{x\to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 1 \text{ ?}$$","['continued-fractions', 'functions']"

Determine the volume of the object obtained by removing this volume $V$ from the inside of the sphere of radius $2$ centered at $0$. Edit: I think evgeny's hint (see below) in the comments is a good one to go with, so I computed the volume V of the surface S with triple integration of the 1-function, with $-1 \le x \le 1$ $-1 \le z \le 1$ -min{f(x), $\sqrt(1-x^2)$} $\le y \le$ +min{f(x), $\sqrt{1-x^2}$}, as my bounds of integration. The volume of the object is then $\frac {32\pi}{3}$ - 8*min{f(x), $\sqrt{1-x^2}$}. Feel free to comment on this answer or offer another solution.

And in the abstract of the lectures, the author argued that there is a misconception among calculus professors: That they say that derivation is just an algorithm, but integration is not and he wants to show that it's not completely true. In his lectures, he gives: Hermite algorithm. Lazard-Rioboo-Trager algorithm. Abel's theorem and the non-integrability of algebraic functions in terms of elementary functions. So, it seems that these algoritms are learnable and also that learn it would not be so overkill. I got curious if Risch algorithm could also be learned by a human being.","['calculus', 'algorithms']"

1358700,An Average of Probabilities,"This is an open ended question in that the desired end result is not well posed.  Still, it may be of some interest. Suppose you have a number of teams which play against each other in two team competitions (all pairings occur with equal likehood, no ties allowed).  Let $P(A,B)$ be the probability that A triumphs in a match between A and B.  Clearly, if you know all the $P(A,B)$ you can compute the team average $P(A)$, the probability that A will win against an unknown opponent.  You can't go the other way, though.  To see this, look at 3 teams $A,B,C$ and suppose $P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = \frac{1}{2}$.  One way we might have gotten this outcome is if $P(X,Y) = \frac{1}{2}$ for any pair of teams X,Y.  In some vague sense, I suppose this is the ""most natural"" guess.  But it is not the only possibility.  We might, for instance,  be in ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" world, where A always beats B, B always beats C, and C always beats A. The Question:  Given all the P(A), is there a reasonably natural way to produce a   list of probabilities P(A, *)? Of course the probabilities must be consistent (so that the list of P(A,B)'s does imply the given list of team averages). Sample attempt:  attach a ""greatness factor"" $\lambda_i$ to each team and then define $$P(A_i,A_j) = .5 + \lambda_i - \lambda_j$$
You can even make the $\lambda$'s sum to 1.  This is easily computable and gives plausible results so long as all the team averages are reasonably near .5.  In more extreme cases, though, you get unphysical results (probabilities greater than 1 and so on). For baseball statistics, where this problem first arose, this crude method works fairly well.

What kind of singularities can it have? Why? Show that the origin is an essential singularity for $e^f$ . Point one is fairly easy: it can either have a pole or an essential singularity, because those are the only possible isolated singularities except for a removable one, which is excluded by hypothesis, and that singularity is surely isolated since the function is holomorphic in the rest of the disk $\mathbb{D}$ . But how do I go about the second one? I thought of trying to prove the conclusions of the Casorati-Weierstrass theorem , because that would exclude a removable singularity since the function would not be bounded, and a pole since the modulus would wildly oscillate and therefore not tend to infinity, which is equivalent to 0 being a pole. But I'm still stuck. I mean, if $f$ has real part going to $-\infty$ and imaginary part doing whatever it wants, then $e^f$ has a removable singularity at 0, yet $f$ still has a pole, since whatever the imaginary part does, the modulus will tend to infinity.

Information: The feasible set $X$ is sequentially compact with respect to weak$^\star$ convergence, and the objective function $f: X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is nonnegative. The arguments: We consider the set \begin{align}
W = \{ f(x): x \in X \}.
\end{align} Now, since $f$ is nonnegative, $W$ is bounded from below and therefore has an infimum. Write $\kappa = \inf W$. Then, by the definition of the infimum there is a sequence $(f(x_n))_n \subset W$ such that \begin{align}
f(x_n) \rightarrow \kappa.
\end{align} By sequential compactness we can find a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})_k$ of $(x_n)_n$, such that \begin{align}
x_{n_k}\overset{w^\star}{\rightarrow}x^\star
\end{align} for some $x \in X$. Clearly, we also have that \begin{align}
f(x_{n_k}) \rightarrow \kappa.

\lim\inf\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) \geq f(x).

Here's the catch: this is from an exercise sheet from over a year ago, so it was written sloppily and it is not clear if we can assume $M$ and $N$ to be metric spaces, or if they are topological spaces in general. I had solved it, but reading again I think that there are some things off in my solution, so I would like some input and to know how to fix it, if needed. What I had done: Let $y \in N$ be arbitrary. Take $x \in f^{-1}(\{y\})$. Since $f$ is a local homeomorphism, exists $U \subset M$ open containing $x$ such that $f\big|_U : U \to f(U)$ is a homeomorphism. In particular, $f$ is bijective. I claim that $\{x\} = U \cap f^{-1}(\{y\})$. If $x' \in U \cap f^{-1}(\{y\})$, we have that $f(x) = f(x') = y$, and since $x,x' \in U$ and $f$ is injective in $U$, we have that $x = x'$. So $x$ is an isolated point of $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ (more precisely, $\{x\} = U \cap f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is the intersection of an open set with $f^{-1}(\{y\})$, hence closed in $f^{-1}(\{y\})$). Since $x$ was arbitrary, every point of $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is isolated, so $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is discrete. And for closedness, it suffices to note that $f^{-1}(\{y\})' = \varnothing \subset f^{-1}(\{y\})$, and every set containing all of its limit points is closed. Issues: It seems I didn't actually prove that $f^{-1}(\{y\})' = \varnothing$, but only that $x \in f^{-1}(\{y\}) \implies x \not\in f^{-1}(\{y\})'$, so I would have to make an argument for the points $x \not\in f^{-1}(\{y\})$. Maybe it is trivial, but I'm not seeing it. I didn't used continuity of $f\big|_U$. This bothers me. Proving continuity of $f$ is the following exercise, which I managed to do (and I'm happy with my work there).

The problem is simple enough, and after evaluating the wronskian I got a result of $~-2~$ . Therefore, the implication is that the two functions are linearly independent for any value of $~x~$ . And the way we've defined linear dependence is the following: If we can find some $~c_1~$ and $~c_2~$ constants such that $$c_1~f(x) + c_2~g(x) = 0~,$$ where $~c_1~$ and $~c_2~$ can't both be zero, then $~f(x)~$ and $~g(x)~$ are linearly dependent. However, with this definition, I can easily think of a counter example to the result of our wronskian: If I pick $~c_1 = 1~$ and $~c_2 = -1~$ , then at $~x = \frac{\pi}{8}~$ , we get that $~\frac{\sqrt 2}{2} - \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} = 0~$ .

I've seen the formula for differentials alot, namely $$dy=f'(x)dx$$ but what I think when I see this is that someone is manipulating the ""formula"" $$f'(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}$$ When I think of ""differential equation"", I think of $$f\left(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx},\frac{d^2y}{dx^2},\cdots,\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}\right)=0$$ not $$f(x,y,dy,dx,\cdots)=0$$ I've heard that $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$ can be approximated by $dy$ and $dx$ (or maybe its the other way around?), but that doesn't make much sense to me. If you replace $dy$ and $dx$ by $\Delta y$ and $\Delta x$, you sort of have Euler's method, but this still doesn't clear much up for me.

1358909,How do we identify $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphisms of a group?,"If $G$ is a finite group, a bijection $f\colon G\to G$ is called a (normed) $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{R}}$-automorphism if $f$ maps subgroups of $G$ to subgroups of $G$, and $f(gH) = f(g) f(H)$ for any $g\in G$ and $H \leq G$, i.e. $f$ maps cosets of $H$ to cosets of $f(H)$. Any automorphism of a group is an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism, but the converse does not hold.  For example, if $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order, then any permutation of the elements that fixes the identity is an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism. In my answer to this question , I observed that the group
$$
\mathbb{Z}_9 \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_3 \;=\; \langle a,b\mid a^9=b^3=1,b^{-1}ab = a^4\rangle
$$
has an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism defined by
$$
f(a^jb^k) = a^{-j}b^{-k}
$$
for all $j,k$. My question is Is there any simple way to prove that $f$ is an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism? The only proof I have is by brute force: we write down all the cosets of all of the subgroups and observe that $f$ maps cosets to cosets. More generally, Are there any good techniques for proving that a given function is an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism?","['lattice-orders', 'group-theory', 'finite-groups']"

1358953,Can you define arc length using a piece of string?,"In calculus, how we calculate the arc length of a curve is by approximating the curve with a series of line segments, and then we take the limit as the number of line segments goes to infinity.  This is a perfectly valid approach to calculating arc length, and obviously it will allow you calculate correctly the length of any (rectifiable) curve.  But it's obviously not the way people intuitively think about the length of a curve. Here is how they introduced arclength to us in elementary school.  If you want to measure the length of a straight line segment, use a ruler.  If you want to measure the length of a curve, overlay the curve with a piece of string, then straighten the string and measure it with a ruler. So I was wondering if it's possible to make a definition of arc length that preserves the spirit of that definition.  Without using the calculus-based definition of length, is there any way to define what it means for one curve to be a ""length-preserving deformation"" of another curve?  If that's possible, we could construct equivalence classes of curves that are length-preserving deformations of one another, and we can define the length associated with an equivalence class to be the length of the straight line that's in the class. Is there anything in topology that would allow us to make such a definition?  We'd need to account for the Euclidean metric somehow, since, e.g. in Taxicab geometry the circumference of a circle is $8r$ rather than $2\pi r$ (which is why your friends keep sending you that dumb $\pi = 4$ picture).

I might say: No, you can tell that can't possibly be right, since it treats $x$ and $y$ on unequal footing.

$$\theta_{11}(z;\tau) = i q^{1/8} y^{1/2} \prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n) (1-yq^n) (1-y^{-1}q^{n-1})$$
$\eta(\tau)$ is the Dedekind eta function
$$\eta(\tau) = q^{1/24}\prod\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$$
and $\mu (z;\tau)$ is the following sum.
$$\mu(z;\tau) = \frac{iy^{1/2}}{\theta_{11}(z;\tau)}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n \frac{q^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}y^n}{1-y q^n}$$
where $q = e^{2\pi i \tau}$ and $y = e^{2\pi i z}$ throughout, with $z \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\tau \in \mathbb{H}$. It is argued below equation (3.22) that since the function $J(z;w;\tau)$ is holomorphic in all its variables, then fixing the value of $w$ to $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1+\tau}{2}$ and $\frac{\tau}{2}$ gives us following identifications of J-function with ratios of theta functions based on the transformation properties of these functions: $$J(z;\frac{1}{2};\tau) = \left(\frac{\theta_{10}(z;\tau)}{\theta_{10}(0;\tau)}\right)^2$$

$$J(z;\frac{\tau}{2};\tau) = \left(\frac{\theta_{01}(z;\tau)}{\theta_{01}(0;\tau)}\right)^2$$ My question is: Why is it so that holomorphicity and transformation properties of J-function at particular values of $w$ fixes the function completely? In other words, how can the authors be sure that, say $J(z;\frac{1+\tau}{2};\tau)$ is exactly equal to $\left(\frac{\theta_{00}(z;\tau)}{\theta_{00}(0;\tau)}\right)^2$ based on the knowledge of the two functions' transformation properties?

$$J(z+\tau;\frac{1+\tau}{2};\tau) = q^{-1} y^{-2} J(z;\frac{1+\tau}{2};\tau)$$
$$J(\frac{z}{\tau};\frac{1+\tau}{2};\frac{-1}{\tau}) = e^{-2\pi i z^2 /\tau} J(z;\frac{1+\tau}{2};\tau)$$ and $\left(\frac{\theta_{00}(z;\tau)}{\theta_{00}(0;\tau)}\right)^2$ also has the same transformation properties.","['modular-forms', 'number-theory', 'theta-functions', 'automorphic-forms', 'complex-analysis']"

Find the probability that within that 2 points contains an extremum point (maxima/minima). I realise part (B) is relatively easy to solve once we have found the extremum points and identify the range of values of the interval that contains the extremum, but my problem is to solve and find its extremum.

1359580,"""Binomiable"" numbers","Is there a nice criterion to determine whether a given natural $m$ can be written as a binomial number $\binom{n}{k}$ with $1 < k < n-1$? I've been thinking on this problem with a friend and all we concluded is that primes aren't ""binomiables"". CLAIM 1. Primes aren't ""binomiables"". Proof. Let $p$ a prime and suppose $p = \binom{n}{k}$. If $n$ is prime, then $n$ must be equals $p$, because $n\mid \binom{n}{k}$. But, in this case, $n\mid\mid \binom{n}{k}$, so $k=1$. (This would work to prime powers too.) If $n$ is composed, note that $\binom{n}{k} = p$ implies, a fortiori , that $p\mid \binom{n}{k}$ and consequently $p\leqslant n$. But under our conditions, $\binom{n}{k} > n$, contradiction. $\square$ Also, I've already saw in Proofs from THE BOOK the problem ""Binomial coefficients are (almost) never powers"", and although it is highly related, it doesn't provide much insight towards this problem (at least as far as I understood). EDIT: Prime powers aren't binomiables too! Let's state three results first: Lemma. Let $p$ a prime. If $p\mid n$ and $0<k<p$, then $p\mid \binom{n}{k}$. Proof. Let $n= pm$ and assume $0<k<p$. Consider the Vandermonde's identity: $$\binom{pm}{k} = \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{p}{j}\binom{p(m-1)}{k-j}.$$ It follows that $\binom{pm}{k}\equiv \binom{p(m-1)}{k} \mod{p}$ (the
term $j=0$ in the sum). Repeating it $m$ times, we conclude
$\binom{pm}{k}\equiv \binom{p}{k} \mod{p}$, and from $p\mid
    \binom{p}{k}$ follows our statement. $\square$ Bertrand's postulate. If $n\geqslant 2k$, then the binomial $\binom{n}{k}$ has a prime factor $q > k$. Theorem. [Erdös] The binomial $\binom{n}{k}$ is never a perfect power for $4\leqslant k\leqslant n-4$. (This is the paragraph I mentioned in Proofs from THE BOOK .) So there is only two cases to analyse, $k=2$ and $k=3$. In both cases we can assume $n \geqslant 6$. CLAIM 2. Prime powers aren't ""binomiables"". Proof. Let $p$ a prime, $m>1$, and suppose $p^m = \binom{n}{k}$. If $k=2$, then $p^m = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. By Bertrand's postulate, $p\neq 2$. Now observe that $\gcd(n, n-1) = 1$, so
  $$ p^m \mid n\quad \text{xor}\quad p^m\mid n-1. $$
  Then:
  $$2 =\frac{n(n-1)}{p^m} \geqslant n-1 \implies n \leqslant 3,$$
  that contradicts $n\geqslant 6$. If $k=3$, then $p^m = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$. Bertrand's postulate allows us to take $p\neq 2,3$. Hence, similarly to the previous case, we can deduce:
  $$p^m \mid n \quad \text{xor}\quad p^m\mid n-1 \quad \text{xor} \quad p^m\mid n-2.$$
  But then:
  $$ 6 = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{p^m} \geqslant (n-1)(n-2) \implies n \leqslant 4,$$
  a contradiction. $\square$ EDIT 2: I've just realized that I didn't use the Lemma at all. Anyway, I think I'll let it here, it may be useful someday hahaha","['number-theory', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
