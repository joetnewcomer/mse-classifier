2528141,Determine if $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(\sin(x))^{n}}{x^2+1}d\lambda(x)$ exists and calculate its value if it exists.,"Determine if the next limit exists and calculate its value if it exists.
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(\sin(x))^{n}}{x^2+1}d\lambda(x)$$
where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb{R}$ My attepmt: We consider $f_{n}(x)=\frac{(\sin(x))^{n}}{x^2+1}$, and $g(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+1}$. Note that $g$ is absoltely improper Riemann integragle, that is, $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|g(x)|dx<\infty$ because
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|g(x)|dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}dx=2\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}dx=\pi<\infty.$$
Therefore, $g$ is Lebegsue integrable in $[-\infty,\infty]$ and 
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)d\lambda(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)dx=\pi <\infty.$$ Note that $|f_{n}(x)|\leq g(x)$ for all $x\in [-\infty,\infty]$. Also, $\{f_{n}(x)\}_{n}$ converge for each $x\in [-\infty,\infty]$, then we define $f$ as
$$f(x)=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }f_{n}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1 & \mathrm{if}\:x=\frac{\pi}{2}+2m\pi \mbox{for some }m\in\mathbb{N} \\
-1 & \mathrm{if}\:x=\frac{3\pi}{2}+2m\pi \mbox{ for some }m\in\mathbb{N}\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{array}\right.$$ We have that $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f d\lambda(x)=0$ because $f$ is not zero in a discrete set. Is it correct? Then, by Dominated Convergence Theorem we have that $f$ is Lebesgue integrable and $$\begin{array}{rcl}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{(\sin(x))^{n}}{x^2+1}d\lambda(x)&=&\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{n}(x)d\lambda(x)\\ &=&\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }f_{n}(x)d\lambda(x) \\ &=&\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x) d\lambda(x)\\&=&0.\end{array}$$ The question: Is my attempt correct? Do I have an error? and if I have it, what is it?","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-measure', 'proof-verification', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"
2528201,Find the marginal distributions (PDFs) of a multivariate normal distribution,"Let $\mathbf{x}\in\Bbb{R}^n$ be a multi-variate normal vector with mean $\bar{\mathbf{x}}\in\Bbb{R}^n$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma\in\Bbb{S}_{++}^n$, where $\Bbb{S}_{++}^n$ denotes the space of all $n\times n$ symetric posotive definite matrices with real entries. Also, let $f$ denote the probability density function of $\mathbf{x}$, i.e., 
$$
f(\mathbf{x})
=
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}\vert\Sigma\vert^{\frac{1}{2}}}
\exp
\left(
-\frac{1}{2}
(\mathbf{x}-\bar{\mathbf{x}})^\top
\Sigma^{-1}
(\mathbf{x}-\bar{\mathbf{x}})
\right).
$$
In general we suppose that $\Sigma$ is a non-diagonal matrix. Thus, the elements of $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_j,\ldots,x_n)^\top$, i.e., the variables $x_j$, $j=1,\ldots,n$ are dependent normal variables. I am interested in the computation of the marginal densities of $x_j$, $j=1,\ldots,n$. In the corresponding Wikipedia's article , it states that: To obtain the marginal distribution over a subset of multivariate normal random variables, one only needs to drop the irrelevant variables (the variables that one wants to marginalize out) from the mean vector and the covariance matrix. It also gives the following example: Example: Let $\mathbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, x_3)^\top$ be multivariate normal random variables with mean vector $\bar{\mathbf{x}}=(\bar{x}_1,\bar{x}_2, \bar{x}_3)^\top$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ (standard
  parametrization for multivariate normal distributions). Then the joint
  distribution of $\mathbf{x}^\prime=(x_1, x_3)^\top$ is multivariate
  normal with mean vector $\bar{\mathbf{x}}^\prime=(\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_3)^\top$ and covariance matrix  $$ \Sigma^\prime = \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{13} \\  \Sigma_{31} & \Sigma_{33} \end{bmatrix}. $$ Does this mean that, if we want to obtain the marginal probability density function of each of $x_j$, for all $j=1,\ldots,n$, we just use the diagonal entries of $\Sigma$ as the variances of the respective random variables? What bugs me is that this would be the same as if $\Sigma$ was diagonal (and thus $x_j$'s independent). Does the solution lie in the parentheses of the above example (i.e., standard parametrization for multivariate normal distributions )?","['probability', 'density-function', 'normal-distribution']"
2528211,"If C is a chain of set S, $C \subseteq S$ or $C \subseteq S \times S$?","I'm doing an exercise, which asks us to prove that ""every infinite set $S \subseteq \mathbb N^n_0$ contains an infinite chain $C\subseteq S$."" But since C is a chain of set S, C is supposed to be a relation on S, which means, suppose P is a poset of S, $P=(S,\preceq)$, $P \subseteq S \times S$, and $C \subseteq P$, so actually $C \subseteq S \times S$. Or maybe in this context it's also understandable to write $C \subseteq S$?
Could anyone please tell me what's wrong here? I think I've misunderstood some concepts. Thank you very much.","['intuition', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2528216,Polarization Operators identity and $GL_{\ell}(\mathbb{R})$,"( This question is also posted in Mathoverflow: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/286539/polarization-operators-and-the-action-of-gl-ell-mathbbr-on-mathcalr ) Let $X$ be a matrix of variables $x_{ij}$ of size $\ell\times n$:
\begin{equation*}
X=\left(\begin{array}{cccc} x_{11}&x_{12} &\dots & x_{1n}\\
x_{21}&x_{22} &\dots & x_{2n}\\
\vdots& \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{\ell 1}&x_{\ell 2} &\dots & x_{\ell n}\\\end{array}\right).
\end{equation*}
The ring $\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}=\mathbb{R}[X]$ of polynomials in $\ell$ sets of $n$ variables is defined as the $\mathbb{R}$-vector space generated by the monomials:
$$X^{A}=\prod_{i=1}^{\ell}\prod_{j=1}^{n}x_{ij}^{a_{ij}}$$
The multidegree of a monomial in this ring is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\deg\left(X^{A}\right):=\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{1j},\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{2j},\dots,\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{\ell j}\right)
\end{equation*}
So an element $f\in\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ have the form
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle{f(X)=\sum_{A\in\mathbb{N}^{\ell\times n}}f_{A}X^{A}}
\end{equation*}
The multidegree of $f$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\deg\left(f(X)\right):={\max}_{{\rm grlex}}\left\{\deg\left(X^{A}\right):\ f_{A}\neq 0\right\}.
\end{equation*}
where the maximum is taken w.r.t. the graded lexicographic order in $\mathbb{N}^{\ell}$. So the ring $\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ is $\mathbb{N}^{\ell}$ graded. Soit $Q$ la matrice diagonale suivante:
\begin{equation*}
Q=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
q_1&0&\dots&0\\
0&q_2&\dots&0\\
\vdots&\vdots&\dots&\vdots\\
0&0&\dots&q_{\ell}\\
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation*}
A polynomial $f(X)\in\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ is said to be homogeneous of multidegree ${\bf d}$ if the following condition holds:
\begin{equation*}
f(QX)={\bf q}^{\bf d}f(X).
\end{equation*}
where ${\bf q}=(q_1,\dots,q_{\ell})$, ${\bf d}=(d_1,\dots,d_{\ell})$ , ${\bf q}^{\bf d}=q_1^{d_1}\dots q_{\ell}^{d_{\ell}}$. It's well known that For a matrix of variables $Y=(y_{{ij}})$ of size $\ell\times n$ and $f\in\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ an homogeneous polynomial of multidegree ${\bf d}$, then for every matrix $M$ of size $\ell\times\ell$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
f(MX)=\sum_{\big\{K\in\mathbb{N}^{\ell\times\ell}:\ \big\vert{K}\big\vert={\bf d}\big\}}
\frac{M^{K}}{K!}\,\prod_{i=1}^{\ell}\prod_{j=1}^{\ell}P_{j,i}^{k_{ij}}
\big(f(Y)\big),
\end{equation*}
  where $$K!:=\displaystyle{\prod_{i=1}^{\ell}\prod_{j=1}^{\ell}k_{ij}!}$$ $$\displaystyle{M^{K}=\prod_{i=1}^{\ell}\prod_{j=1}^{\ell}m_{i,j}^{k_{ij}}}$$ and the polarization operator $P_{ik}$ is given by
  $$P_{i,k}:=\displaystyle{\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{ij}\frac{\partial\ }{\partial y_{kj}}}.$$ The notation $\ \big\vert{K}\big\vert={\bf d}$ represents the set of all squares matrices $K$ of order $\ell$ such that $\displaystyle{\sum_{j=1}^{n}k_{ij}=d_{i}}$, for all $i$ such that $1\leq i\leq\ell$. My question: Reading Claudio Procesi book I saw that the ring $\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ is closed under polarization operators $P_{ik}$ if and only if is closed under the action of the general linear group $GL_{\ell}(\mathbb{R})$. Using the formula for $f(MX)$ above I can understand why geing closed under the $P_{ik}$ implies that $\mathcal{R}_{n}^{(\ell)}$ is closed under the right side action of $GL_{\ell}(\mathbb{R})$. But, how to find the matrices $M$ to show the reciprocal of this result. Thank for any hint on this.","['combinatorics', 'algebraic-groups', 'invariant-theory', 'generalized-polarization-modules']"

2528378,What is known about the space of geodesic vector fields on a surface?,"Let $M$ be a compact two-dimensional manifold.

$$\nabla_v v = \phi v$$
where $\phi$ is a function $M\to\mathbb{R}$. What is known about the space of such vector fields? Is there a way to characterize or parameterize them? For example, I imagine one possible construction is to pick a closed subset $S$ of $M$, construct the signed distance function $d_S$ to $S$, and set $v = \nabla d_S$. This vector field is undefined at the cut locus of $S$, but presumably that can be fixed by adjusting the magnitude of $v$ so that it vanishes near the cut locus.","['differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

Can we say that when an even function is expressed as a Fourier series, the Fourier cosine series is also the Fourier series?

2528608,"Find the number of solutions of $|\cos(x)|=\cot(x)+\frac{1}{\sin(x)}$ that lie in $[-4\pi,4\pi]$.","I came across this problem Find the number of solutions of $|\cos(x)|=\cot(x)+\frac{1}{\sin(x)}$ that lie in $[-4\pi,4\pi]$ in a PreCalculus book and I am looking for a simple solution. What I can say: let $\displaystyle f(x)=|\cos(x)|$ and $\displaystyle g(x)=\cot(x)+\frac{1}{\sin(x)}$ The functions $f$ and $g$ are $2\pi$-periodic so it is enough to study the problem on $[0,2\pi]$. The function $g$ is undefined when $x$ is a multiple of $\pi$. $g(x)=\frac{1+\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}$, so $g$ has the same sign than $\sin$. Therefore, there is no solution on $(\pi,2\pi)$ and e can assume that $x\in(0,\pi)$. Let $c=\cos(x)$. Then $c$ is a root of $P(c)=c^4+2c+1$ and $c\in[-1,1]$. By Descartes' Rule of Signe, $P$ has no positive root and $0$ or $2$ negative roots (counted with multiplicity). $c=-1$ is one of them and Synthetic Division gives $P(c)=(c+1)(c^3-c^2+c+1)$. Let $Q(c)=c^3-c^2+c+1$. $Q(-1)\neq 0$, so $P$ has another negative root. By the Lower Bound Rule, $c=-1$ is a lower bound for the roots of $P$ and the other root, say $a$ is in $(-1,0)$. This means that the original equation has at most one solution ($x=\arccos(a)$) in $(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$. On the other hand, $f$ is decreasing $(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$, $g(x)=\cot(\frac{x}{2})$, so $g$ is decreasing on $(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$. Since $f(\frac{\pi}{2})=0<1=g(\frac{\pi}{2})$ and $f(\pi)=1>0=\cot(\frac{\pi}{2})$, we obtain that $f(x)=g(x)$ for exactly one value in $(\frac{\pi}{2},\pi)$. Finally, there is exactly one solution in $[0,2\pi]$, so there are $4$ solutions in the given interval. That's quite convoluted, so I was hoping for a way to shortcut the solution.

Answer: $(3\pm \sqrt{2})^4$ . My attempt: I will make my attempt below, but I think the approach might be too complicated... are there simpler approaches? I started making the substitution $$u=\sqrt[4]{386-x},~~v=\sqrt[4]{x}$$ so that $u^4+v^4=386$ . Therefore we can define a system of 2 equations, in order to hopefully find $u$ and $v$ : $$\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
u+v=6 \\ 
u^4+v^4=386\\ 
\end{array}
\right.
$$ If we use $p_k=u^k+v^k$ , $e_1=(u+v)$ and $e_2=uv$ , by Newton-Girard identities we get $$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
p_4=e_1p_3-e_2p_2\\
p_3=e_1p_2-e_2p_1\\
p_2=e_1p_1-e_2\times 2\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$ But as we know that $p_1=e_1=u+v=6$ , we can make the substitutions backwards, 
so that $$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
p_2=36-2 uv\\
p_3=6(36-2uv)-6uv=216-18uv\\
p_4=6(216-18uv)-uv(36-2 uv)\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$ But, as we know that $p^4=u^4+v^4=386$ , so making the substitution $z=uv$ and some simplifications the last equation is equivalent to $$-z^2+72z-455=0.$$ Solving this last equation we find the roots $7$ and $65$ , therefore $uv$ will potentially have these two values. Now as we know that $u+v=6$ we can set a system to solve for $u$ and $v$ : $$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
u+v=6\\
uv=7~~\text{or}~~65\\
\end{array}
\right.
$$ That can be solved noticing the $u$ and $v$ are the roots of $P(z)=z^2-(u+v)z+uv$ . When $uv=65$ , $P(z)$ has only complex roots. When $uv=7$ , $P(z)$ has 2 real roots. 
When using $uv=7$ the roots $(u,v)$ for $P(z)$ are, by the symmetry, either $$(3-\sqrt{2},3+\sqrt{2})~~\text{or}~~(3+\sqrt{2},3-\sqrt{2}).$$ But as $x=v^4$ the final solution would be $$x=(3\pm \sqrt{2})^4=193\pm 132\sqrt{2}.$$ Both solutions comply with the initial restritions for the argument of the radicals: $0\le x\le 386$ .

Background The motivation for this question comes from the following. Suppose $\mathbf A (x)$ is a $2\times 2$ matrix such that $\det (\mathbf A (x))$ has $n+1$ roots (inside the unit circle): $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $0$. To solve some forecasting problems (in which $\mathbf A (x)$ represents the signal structure) it is useful to find a matrix $\mathbf B (x)$ such that $\det(\mathbf A (x)\mathbf B (x))$ has no roots (inside the unit circle). A procedure to obtain the matrix $\mathbf B (x)$ is as follows. To remove the first root, $\lambda_1$, you multiply $\mathbf A (x)$ by an unitary matrix times the Blaschke matrix for this root, i.e. $$ \mathbf A^* (x) = \mathbf A (x) \mathbf W_1 \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{x-\lambda_1}{1-\lambda_1 x}\end{bmatrix}$$ where $\mathbf W_1$ is a matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors of the of $\mathbf A(\lambda_1)$. To remove the second root, $\lambda_2$, you repeat this step using $\mathbf A^*(x)$ instead of $\mathbf A(x)$. Then, one can simply repeat this step for each of the other roots. The matrices $\mathbf M_i(x)$ above are (up to a constant), the transpose of the matrices that are multiplied to $\mathbf A^*(x)$ in each step described above. One simplifying aspect of the problem I am working with is that the second row of $\mathbf A(x)$ is equal to $0$ when evaluated at any of the roots.","['matrices', 'complex-analysis', 'recurrence-relations', 'linear-algebra']"

To date over 200 proofs of this result have been found. The single most frustrating thing about this theorem is that there are no easy proofs of it, at least when measured relative to the simplicity of the statement and the mathematics it involves. For someone like myself, who prides themselves on being able to find very slick proofs, it can drive you insane. As an undergraduate, when confronted with the lattice-point proof in an introductory number theory class, I refused to learn it. I thought to myself there's no way I need to go through all that just to prove something so simple. There must be an easier way. Zolotarev's Proof of the law has been to date the simplest, and quite frankly most elegant, proof that I can find. The crucial step involves equating the value of the Legendre symbol with the signature of the permutation on $\mathbb{Z}_q$ induced by left multiplication. It can take a little bit longer going through it the first time, but winds up being one of those proofs you can just remember without needing to re-reference it.

If for some $B\in\gamma$ we have $B'\in\gamma$ the square peg problem is solved, and solving the square peg problem with suitable smoothness assumptions boils down to showing that two curves intersect (like in Gauss' original proof of the fundamental Theorem of Algebra). $\hspace{1in}$ The green curve and the ellipse intersect, hence the square peg problem can be solved in an ellipse. Context's over. Now I propose the following variation: let $\gamma$ be a (simple,) closed curve of class $C^2$ without any inflection point. Given some $P\in\gamma$ , we define $P'$ as the symmetric of $P$ with respect to the center of curvature of $P$ . We denote as $\gamma'$ the set $\{P':P\in\gamma\}$ . Q1 . Is it true that $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ always have an intersection? Q2 . Has this problem already been studied in the literature?","['fixed-point-theorems', 'plane-curves', 'curvature', 'geometry']"

Is it meant in the sense that the tangent vectors at that point provide the best linear approximation of functions on the manifold at that point? Does this extend for a sufficiently small neighbourhood around a given point? In the context of GR, is this a mathematical implementation of the equivalence principle, in the sense that the $T_{p}M$ is flat and so the laws of physics are those of special relativity (SR) on $T_{p}M$.

2529862,Proof that a function is bijective if and only if it is both surjective and injective,"I am given the usual definitions for surjectivity and injectivity, but I am introduced with an alternative formulation of bijectivity: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are sets and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a mapping. This mapping is said to be bijective if $\exists g:Y\rightarrow X$ such that $\forall x\in X,\ y\in Y$, $f(g(y))=y$ and $g(f(x))=x$. I have to proof that in this sense, bijectivity is equivalent to simultaneous injectivity and surjectivity. Now from bijectivity, I found it quite easy to prove the other two conditions. The other way around, however, poses some difficulty. My proof: Suppose $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is surjective and injective. I define the function $g:Y\rightarrow X$ by $g(y)=x\Longleftrightarrow f(x)=y$. Surjectivity of $f$ implies $\forall y\in Y\ \exists x\in X$ such that $f(x)=y$, thus $f(g(y))=y$. Now suppose $x,z\in X$ and $f(x)=f(z)$. Along with the definition of $g$ this implies $g(f(z))=x$. From injectivity follows $x=z$, thus $g(f(x))=x$. First of all, initially, I have not shown that $g$ is well-defined. I am not sure how to actually prove this, or if it is even necessary here. However, using surjectivity of $f$ is it easy to see that $g$ maps every value of $Y$. Can I conclude from this that the function is well-defined, or is there more to say on the matter? I suppose I would also have to show that $g$ cannot take on two different values of $x$ for the same $y$. Also, suppose I have proven that $g$ is indeed well-defined, is my proof as presented above correct? Thank you for your help! EDIT: From a discussion in the comments of an answer, I have come to realise that perhaps I have misused the term ""well-defined"". Since I don't really understand the formal definition, I will re-state a part of my question as follows: can I directly use $g$ as defined above, or do I have to prove that it is ""okay"" to use it? I'm really not sure how to say this anymore... intuitively, I would say that ""okay"" means that the definition itself does not produce any inconsistencies.

We see that on $\mathbb{R}$ when $y = 0$, this becomes: $$
f(x) = e^{\frac{1}{1 + x^2}} \qquad x \in \mathbb{R},

Furthermore, this function is analytic on $\mathbb{R}$, and so there exists some power series of form: $$
f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n (x - x_0)^n \qquad a_n, x, x_0 \in \mathbb{R}

Let's say both regions must be contiguous. Note that without loss of generality, we may consider the restricted range $A\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]$, because we can always swap the black and white regions. A simple way of dividing the square into two regions is to draw a straight line parallel to two of the sides (right figure). This works for any area, and has an interface perimeter of $P=1$, regardless of the area. Another solution* is to draw a quadrant, centered at one of the square's corners (left figure). Clearly, we can enclose more than half of the area with this method, so it can be used for any given $A$. Using simple geometry, we can show that to enclose an area $A<\frac{1}{2}$, the interface perimeter will be $P = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{A}$. This means that the quadrant is a better solution than the line when $\sqrt{\pi}\sqrt{A}<1$, or $A<\frac{1}{\pi}$, and a candidate optimal (?) solution would be: My question is: Is there a solution better than the one above? If not, how can we
prove that this solution is optimal? Bonus question: Does the optimal solution change if the regions are not required to be contiguous? *Other solutions such as a full circle, a semi-circle using the border as a diameter, a square using the borders as two of the sides, and a diagonal line at 45 degrees all do worse than the quadrant for any $A$, and therefore cannot feature in an optimal solution.","['nonlinear-optimization', 'optimization', 'calculus', 'geometry', 'area']"

Somehow we want to express the cohomology of $X$ and $Y$ in terms of each other (motivating example : expressing the cohomology of projective space in terms of that of the sphere). This question is strongly related, but here we are concerned with the technical details of the claim. For now we are only interested in homology. Firstly we want a nice action of $G$ on $\Omega^*(Y)$. I think we can define one as follows : if $g$ is a covering space automorphism of $Y$, we can associate an automorphism $g^* : \Omega^*(Y) \to \Omega^*(Y)$. The action induced by $G$ is an action by such automorphisms. Now denote by $\Omega^*(Y)^G$ the subalgebra of differential forms on $Y$ that are fixed by all automorphisms $g^*$. Claim : The induced map $p^*:\Omega^*(X) \to \Omega^*(Y)^G$ is an isomorphism. This is where I encounter some problems. Firstly I can show that $p^*(\Omega^*(X)) \subset \Omega^*(Y)^G$ (the covering map $p$ and some automorphism $g$ of covering spaces form a commutative diagram. This gives us a ""reverse"" commutative diagram in homology with $p^*$ and $g^*$ from which we can deduce the inclusion). However the reverse inclusion seems difficult. We may have to use at some point the fact that $p$ is Galois ($Y=X/G$) but it gets more confusing as I go forward. Moreover we should be able to find an explicit inverse for $p^*$ but I am unable to do so. Is my group action even reasonable ? Any help in either direction would be greatly appreciated.","['homology-cohomology', 'differential-topology', 'algebraic-topology', 'general-topology', 'differential-geometry']"

2529924,Proof of Schwarz's theorem on partial derivatives for vector-valued functions,"I really appreciate your help in checking the below proof (especially the last section). Let $(E_{i})_{i=1 \dots n}$ and $F$ be normed vector spaces and $f: \prod{E_{i}}\rightarrow F$ a twice-differentiable function (no hypothesis is made on the continuity of partial derivatives). We want to prove that $\forall a,h,k \in \prod{E_{i}}, f''(a)(h)(k)=f''(a)(k)(h)$. We write $\Delta(a,h,k)=f(a+h+k)-f(a+h)-f(a+k)+f(a)$. Then: $||\Delta(a,h,k) - f''(a)(k)(h)|| \leq$
$||\Delta(a,h,k) - f'(a+k)(h)+f'(a)(h)||+||f'(a+k)(h)-f'(a)(h)-f''(a)(k)(h)||$ Let $(1)$ denote the first summand and $(2)$ the second. I can show that $(2)=o(||h||.||k||)$ using the definition of $f''$ therefore I will now try to do the same with $(1)$ (from there we can conclude by applying the same reasoning to $||\Delta(a,h,k) - f''(a)(h)(k)||$ and using the linearity of the derivatives: I am not interested in that part of the proof). $(1) = ||\Delta(a,h,k) - f'(a+k)(h)+f'(a)(h)||=$ $||\delta(a,h,k)-\delta(a,h,0)|| \leq $ $||k||.Sup_{x \in B(0,||k||)}{||f'(a+h+x)-f'(a+x)-f''(a+x)(h)||}$ where $\delta(a,h,k)= f(a+h+k)-f(a+k)-f'(a+k)(h)$, $B(0,||k||)$ the closed ball with center $0$ and radius $||k||$, and using the Mean Value theorem.
Since $f'$ is differentiable it is continuous and the $Sup$ is reached at some point say $x0$. $(1) \leq ||k||.||f'(a+h+x0)-f'(a+x0)-f''(a+x0)(h)|| \leq $ $||k||.||f''(a+x0)(h)|| \leq$ $||k||.||h||.||f''(a+x0)|| = o(||h||.||k||)$ P.S.: Is there any useful, simple way to weaken the hypotheses?","['derivatives', 'normed-spaces', 'proof-verification']"

Find: set of values for $c$ such that $(1)$ has solution in $\mathbb R$. Question from the Brazilian Math Olympiad 2004. No solution provided. I'm not sure whether I'm setting the right constraints to find the asked set. Hints and full solutions are appreciated. My attempt: as an initial observation, the solution must consider at least 2 constraints: $(c_1)$ $x\ge 0;$ and, $(c_2)$ $\sqrt{x}\ge -c$, to avoid negative arguments in the square root. By assuming ($c_1$) and ($c_2$) hold, and squaring both terms in (1) we get
$$\sqrt{x}=\sqrt{\sqrt{x}+c}\Leftrightarrow x=\sqrt{x}+c\Leftrightarrow x-c=\sqrt{x}.$$ Now considering an addicional constraint $(c_3)$ $x-c\ge 0$, and squaring both terms, we get
$$x-c=\sqrt{x}\Leftrightarrow x^2-2cx+c^2=x \Leftrightarrow x^2-(2c+1)x+c^2=0$$
To solve this last equation, notice that 
$$\triangle=(2c+1)^2-4c^2=4c+1$$
Therefore, another constraint, for real roots, is $\triangle\ge 0$ or $(c_4)$ $c\ge -1/4$. And the tentative solution for $x$, before checking constraints, will be given by
$$x=\frac{2c+1\pm\sqrt{4c+1}}{2}.$$
Now the set of values for $c$ that leads to a real solution in $x$, will be the set resulting from the intersection of 4 conditions:

Question: (a) is this last step the right set of conditions to be intersected to give the asked set for $c$? (b) how to solve for the intersection of the conditions? Hints and full answers are appreciated. Maybe I'm just complicating something that is a lot easier.","['algebra-precalculus', 'contest-math', 'inequality', 'radicals']"
