16701,What are open immersions in terms of rings?,"Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two commutative rings, and let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a ring homomorphism. Suppose that the induced map on the spectra $f^*:Spec B\rightarrow Spec A$ is an open immersion. What does it say about $f$? does it follows that $f$ is a localization? edit: Thanks for the answer!

16719,Algebra without Zorn's lemma,"One can't get too far in abstract algebra before encountering Zorn's Lemma.  For example, it is used in the proof that every nonzero ring has a maximal ideal.  However, it seems that if we restrict our focus to Noetherian rings, we can often avoid Zorn's lemma.  How far could a development of the theory for just Noetherian rings go?  When do non-Noetherian rings come up in an essential way for which there is no Noetherian analog?  For example, Artin's proof that every field has an algebraic closure uses Zorn's lemma.  Is there a proof of this theorem (or some Zorn-less version of this theorem) that avoids it?","['abstract-algebra', 'axiom-of-choice']"
16723,Evaluation of the sum $\sum_{k = 0}^{\lfloor a/b \rfloor} \left \lfloor \frac{a - kb}{c} \right \rfloor$,"Let $a, b$ and $c$ be positive integers. Recall that the greatest common divisor (gcd) function has the following representation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textbf{gcd}(b,c) = 2 \sum_{k = 1}^{c- 1} \left \lfloor \frac{kb}{c} \right \rfloor + b + c - bc
\end{eqnarray}
as shown by Polezzi, where $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denotes the floor function. In trying to generalize the formula I came across the following summation
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 0}^{\lfloor a/b \rfloor} \left \lfloor \frac{a - kb}{c} \right \rfloor.
\end{eqnarray}
I can prove the following identity for real $x$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 0}^{c-1} \left \lceil \frac{x - kb}{c} \right \rceil = d \left \lceil \frac{x}{d} \right \rceil - \frac{(b-1)(c-1)}{2} - \frac{d-1}{2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lceil \cdot \rceil$ denotes the ceiling function and $d = \text{gcd}(b,c)$. (Note that in the first summation the upper index is in general independent of $c$.) Ideas or reference suggestions are certainly appreciated. Thanks in advance! Update I can prove the identity
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 0}^{c-1} \left \lfloor \frac{x - kb}{c} \right \rfloor = d \left \lfloor \frac{x}{d} \right \rfloor - \frac{(b+1)(c-1)}{2} + \frac{d-1}{2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $d = \text{gcd}(b,c)$. There is another identity which might be useful. If $n = c \ell +r$ with $0 \leq r < c$, then
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 1}^{n} \left \lfloor \frac{k}{c} \right \rfloor = c \binom{\ell}{2} + (r + 1) \ell.
\end{eqnarray} Update 2 Ok, so I can prove that for real $x, y > 0$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 0}^{\lfloor y \rfloor} \left \lfloor x + \frac{k}{y} \right \rfloor = \lfloor xy + (\lceil y \rceil - y) \lfloor x + 1 \rfloor \rfloor + \chi_{\mathbb{N}}(y)(\lfloor x \rfloor + 1),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\chi_{\mathbb{N}}$ denotes the characteristic function of the positive integers. My original problem (and a nice generalization of it) will be in hand if I can evaluate the following minor generalization: For real $x, y  > 0$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \left \lfloor x + \frac{k}{y} \right \rfloor.

16724,How far are the $p$-adic numbers from being algebraically closed?,"A few days ago I was recalling some facts about the $p$-adic numbers, for example the fact that the $p$-adic metric is an ultrametric implies very strongly that there is no order on $\mathbb{Q}_p$, as any number in the interior of an open ball is in fact its center. I know that if you take the completion of the algebraic closure of the $p$-adic completion you get something which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$ (this result was very surprising until I studied model theory, then it became obvious). Furthermore, if the algebraic closure is of an extension of dimension $2$ then the field is orderable, or even real closed. Either way, it implies that the $p$-adic numbers don't have this property. So I was thinking, is there a $p$-adic number whose square equals $2$? $3$? $2011$? For which prime numbers $p$? How far down the rabbit hole of algebraic numbers can you go inside the $p$-adic numbers? Are there general results connecting the choice (or rather properties) of $p$ to the ""amount"" of algebraic closure it gives?","['p-adic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

16728,"How $\log(t)$ can be the limit of $t^r$, where $r\to 0$?","My class is solving the Cauchy-Euler differential equation $a t^2 y'' + b t y' + c y = 0$.  The solutions are powers of $t$, $y = t^r$ and then you solve for $r$ using the characteristic equation $a r^2 + (b-a) r + c = 0$.  This has two roots $r = \overline{r} \pm \Delta r$ and the general solution is $y = A t^{\overline{r} + \Delta r} + B t^{\overline{r} - \Delta r }$. What happens if we get double roots, i.e. $(b-a)^2 = 4ac$ or $\Delta r = 0$? We guess a solution of $y = t^r \ln t$.  Can derive this guess taking the limit of two distinct roots solution as $\Delta r$ tends to 0?  In some sense 
$$ A t^{\overline{r} + \Delta r} + B t^{\overline{r} - \Delta r }
= t^{\overline{r}} (  A t^{ \Delta r} + B t^{ - \Delta r }) \to  t^{\overline{r}} (C + D \ln t )$$
for some constants $A,B,C,D$. In a way, it is plausible the limit works this way because of the integral formula:
$$ \int t^{r - 1}\mathrm dt = \begin{cases}  \frac{t^r}{r} & r \neq 0\\ \ln t  & r = 0 \end{cases}$$
And I expect this is coming into play in the Euler-Cauchy equation.  How to make it rigorous, though?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

16737,Riemannian Immersions into Euclidean Space?,"The Whitney embedding theorem states that any smooth manifold can be embedded in Euclidean space. In the Riemannian setting this naturally leads to the question whether this can be done in such a way that the Riemannian metric is preserved, that is, whether we can find an embedding such that the inherited metric as a submanifold of Euclidean space is the original metric? I guess there are partial results on this topic (e.g. spaces of constant curvature), but is there anything like the Whitney embedding theorem? Any answers, links, book recommendations would be very much appreciated! Thanks in advance for your always great responses, S.L.

16742,AGM Inequality Proof,"I have been stuck on this one for hours. Let $x$, $y$, $z$ be non-negative real numbers. Also we know $x + z \leq 2$. Prove the following: $(x - 2y + z)^2 \geq 4xz - 8y$. Apparently this can be proven with or without AGM, which is $xy \leq \left(\frac{x + y}{2}\right)^2$. This is what I have done so far: \begin{align}
((x + z) - 2y)^2 &\geq 4xz - 8y\\
(x + z)^2 -4y(x + z) + 4y^2 &\geq 4xz - 8y
&\quad&\text{expanded the squared term keeping }(x+z)\\

$$\left(\frac{x + z}{2}\right)^2 -yx -yz + 2y \geq xz - y^2.$$ This is as far as I got and we also know that the told us this:
$x + z \leq 2$. Rearranging we get: $x + z - 2 \leq 0$; then multiply by $y$ to get:

16829,Useful sufficient conditions for a topological space to be the underlying space of a topological group?,"Here is a question that I have had in my head for a little while and was recently reminded of. Let $X$ be a (nonempty!) topological space.  What are useful (or even nontrivial) sufficient conditions for $X$ to admit a group law compatible with its topology? There are many necessary conditions: for instance $X$ must be completely regular.  In particular, if it is a Kolmogorov space it must be a Urysohn space.  It must be homogeneous in the sense that the self-homeomorphism group $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ acts transitively.  In particular $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ must act transitively on the connected components of $X$. It is rather clear though that these conditions are nowhere near sufficient even for very nice topological spaces.  A recent question on this site calls attention to this: even for the class of smooth manifolds there are a sequence of successively more intricate necessary conditions but (apparently) no good sufficient conditions. What about for other classes of spaces?  Here are two examples: it suffices for $X$ to be discrete (i.e., every set is open) or indiscrete (i.e., only $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open).  These are, of course, completely trivial.  Can anyone do any better than this?  For instance: If $X$ is totally disconnected and compact (for me this implies Hausdorff), must it admit the structure of a topological group? Added : as some have rightly pointed out, the above necessary condition of homogeneity is not implied by my assumptions.  So let us assume this as well.  Note that assuming second-countability as well forces the space to be (finite and discrete or) homeomorphic to the Cantor set, which is well-known to carry a topological group structure, so I don't want to assume that.","['general-topology', 'topological-groups']"

16841,$f(x) + f(1-x) = f(1)$,"I was discussing with a friend of mine about her research and I came across this problem. The problem essentially boils down to this. $f(x)$ is a function defined in $[0,1]$ such that $f(x) + f(1-x) = f(1)$. I want to find a condition on $f(x)$ so that I can conclude $f(x) = f(1)x$. Clearly, $f \in C^{0}[0,1]$ alone is insufficient to conclude $f(x) = f(1)x$. My hunch is if $f(x) \in C^{\infty}[0,1]$, then $f(x) = f(1)x$. However, I am unable to prove it. Further, is there a weaker condition with which I can conclude $f(x) = f(1)x$?

Motivation : The motivation behind this is an algorithm which receives a list L and needs to calculate $B(A(x), A(y))$ for each unordered pair ${x,y}$ of distinct elements of L (I'm only considering unordered pairs since $B(u,w)=B(w,u)$). The result of operation A is very large and takes almost half of the available memory. Such a circuit will allow me to minimize the number of calls to operation $A$. Note : This is a sort of ""undirected"" version of generating a de-Bruijn sequence. I once heard it's possible to generate a de-Bruijn sequence with constant memory, but I don't know how to do that.","['graph-theory', 'algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

16947,Proving there is no natural number which is both even and odd,"I've run into a small problem while working through Enderton's Elements of Set Theory. I'm doing the following problem: Call a natural number even if it has the form $2\cdot m$ for some $m$. Call it odd if it has the form $(2\cdot p)+1$ for some $p$. Show that each natural number number is either even or odd, but never both. I've shown most of this, and along the way I've derived many of the results found in Arturo Magidin's great post on addition , so any of the theorems there may be used. It is the 'never both' part with which I'm having trouble. This is some of what I have: Let
$$
B=\{n\in\omega\ |\neg(\exists m(n=2\cdot m)\wedge\exists p(n=2\cdot p+1))\},
$$
the set of all natural numbers that are not both even and odd. Since $m\cdot 0=0$, $0$ is even. Also $0$ is not odd, for if $0=2\cdot p+1$, then $0=(2\cdot p)^+=\sigma(2\cdot p)$, but then $0\in\text{ran}\ \sigma$, contrary to the first Peano postulate. Hence $0\in B$. Suppose $k\in B$. Suppose $k$ is odd but not even, so $k=2\cdot p+1$ for some $p$. Earlier work of mine shows that $k^+$ is even. However, $k^+$ is not odd, for if $k^+=2\cdot m+1$ for some $m$, then since the successor function $\sigma$ is injective, we have
$$
k^+=2\cdot m+1=(2\cdot m)^+\implies k=2\cdot m
$$
contrary to the fact that $k$ is not even. Now suppose $k$ is even, but not odd. I have been able to show that $k^+$ is odd, but I can't figure a way to show that $k^+$ is not even. I suppose it must be simple, but I'm just not seeing it. Could someone explain this little part? Thank you.","['natural-numbers', 'arithmetic', 'elementary-set-theory']"

16970,A way to determine the ideal number of maximum iterations for an arbitrary zoom level in a Mandelbrot fractal,"I've created a JavaScript-based fractal drawer which you can see here: http://jsfiddle.net/xfF3f/12/ As you're probably all aware, a Mandelbrot Set is created by iterating over pixels as though they were coordinates on the real and imaginary planes. Each pixel then has a real and an imaginary part (like all complex numbers) which can be fed into an iterative loop of its own: $ z = z^2 + c $ Where both z and c are complex numbers, z starts at 0 , and c is the value of our pixel. If you run this a bunch of times, the squared modulus of z ( |z| ) will either stay below a limit you set (6 in my fractal drawer) or it will go above the limit. If it goes above the limit, you break the iteration and consider that pixel to be outside of the set. When this happens, you color that pixel a certain color depending on how big |z| has gotten and how many iterations it took to determine that it's outset the set. (See more on the formula used in my drawer here: Continuous coloring of a Mandelbrot fractal ) So given all this, we can say that a higher max iteration value will tell you with greater precision whether or not a point is in the set. It will also take more time to run because it's doing more calculations per pixel. There are also other visual factors... If you start at a full zoom out and run the plot with a maxIterations value of 50, 100, and 300, you get this: So you can see that while the detail of the edge of the set does get better as you increase the maxIterations value, the pixels outside the set are almost all red. At this zoom level, I'd say something like 50 iterations would be an ideal balance of color variation and edge detail. Now if you zoom in to some arbitrary level keeping 50 maxIterations, you will begin to see something like this: The detail is horrible and the colors are also a bit homogeneous. So let's see what happens if we keep the same zoom level and change the maxIterations number to 80, 120, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 (remember, the coordinates and zoom are exactly the same in all images, the only difference is the maxIterations value): As usual, increasing the maxIterations value too much leaves most of the points outside of the set red. Here I'd say something between the second (120 maxIterations) and third (250 maxIterations) is more or less ideal. This is all relatively simple to do one image at a time with your eye and some tinkering, but this would be very difficult to do if I were to create a zoom like this: http://vimeo.com/1908224 . I'd need some method of finding something like an ideal maxIterations value depending on the zoom level. So after all of this, my question is: is there some such method? If not, where might I start to look in order to figure this out for myself? Am I thinking about this wrong? Is there a more obvious solution that I'm missing?

The question is: Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and let $A,B \subset X$. If $A$ is an open dense subset, and $B$ is a dense subset, then is $A \cap B$ dense in $X$?. Well, i think this is true. We have to show that $\overline{A \cap B}=X$. Or in other words, $B(x,r) \cap (A \cap B) \neq \emptyset$ for any $x \in X$. Since $A$ is dense in $X$, so we have $B(x,r) \cap A \neq\emptyset$.

17013,"Coordinate free proof that curvature is the ""square"" of the connection","Here's the setup.  Consider a vector bundle $E$ over a manifold $M$ and let $\Omega^*(M, E)$ denote the space of $E$-valued differential forms (i.e. the space of sections of the vector bundle $\bigwedge^* T^*M \otimes E$).  Let $\nabla$ be an affine connection on $E$, i.e. a map $\Omega^0(M, E) \to \Omega^1(M, E)$ satisfying the Leibniz rule.  For each vector field $X$ there is a contraction operator $\iota(X)$ on $\Omega^*(M,E)$, and we form $\nabla_X = \iota(X) \nabla$. Recall that the curvature of $\nabla$ is defined to be $F(X,Y) = [\nabla_X, \nabla_Y] - \nabla_{[X,Y]}$.  It is well known that $F$ is actually a $End(E)$-valued 2-form.  $\Omega^2(M, End(E))$ acts on $\Omega^*(M, E)$ in the standard way, and it is also well known that $\nabla^2: \Omega^k(M,E) \to \Omega^{k+2}(M, E)$ is given by the action of $F$. My question is about the proof that ""$\nabla^2 = F$"" in the sense described above.  The textbook proofs all involve trivializing $E$ and doing a coordinate calculation; I don't mind trivializing $E$, but for my own nefarious (and perhaps misguided) purposes I would like to avoid coordinates.  Here is what I mean. If $E$ is trivial then $\nabla = d + \omega$ where $\omega$ is an $End(E)$-valued 1-form.  So $F(X,Y) = [\iota(X)(d+\omega), \iota(Y)(d + \omega] - \iota([X,Y])(d + \omega)$, and it seems to me that one should be able to carry out the argument using only Cartan's homotopy formulas.  There are complications which arise from the fact that the $d$ operator and the contraction operators are different for $\Omega^*(M, End(E))$ versus $\Omega^*(M,E)$, but nevertheless I can get tantalizingly close.  I can show my progress if it would help you help me. In any event, I've been at it for quite some time now and I've decided it's time to seek assistance.  So I'm wondering if anybody knows either how to do this, a reason why it can't be done, or a place where I could look it up.  Thanks in advance!","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"

that a is not a limit point of $A$ so we can find a basis element $U_{a}$ such that $U_{a} \cap A = \{a\}$.

Why do we need the property: $\langle A, B\rangle =\langle O^{T}AO,O^{T}BO\rangle$? Thank you very much. Edit: I am having a course about random matrices. The course is related to the lecture notes: http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.1858 . On page 2, equation (2.4), I think that the integral is a haar integral. I don't know why we need (2.5) in the paper.

17267,"""On the consequences of an exact de Bruijn Function"", or ""If Ramanujan had more time...""","In this question on Math.SE, I asked about Ramanujan's (ridiculously close) approximation for counting the number of 3-smooth integers less than or equal to a given positive integer $N$, namely, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\log 2 N \ \log 3 N}{2 \log 2 \ \log 3}.
\end{eqnarray}
In his posthumously published notebook , Ramanujan generalized this formula to similarly counting numbers of the form $b_1^{r_1} b_{2}^{r_{2}}$, where $b_1, b_2 > 1$ are (not necessarily distinct) natural numbers and $r_1, r_2 \geq 0$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\log b_1 N \ \log b_2 N}{2 \log b_1 \ \log b_2},
\end{eqnarray}
where a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is to be added if $N$ is of the prescribed form. Both of these problems could be understood by counting the number of non-negative integer solutions of the Diophantine inequality: $(\log b_1) x_1 + (\log b_2) x_2 \leq \log N$, which also counts the number of $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice points in the $\log N$ dilate of the $2$-polytope $\mathcal{P} = \textbf{conv}(\mathbf{0}, (\log b_{1})^{-1} \mathbf{e}_1, (\log b_2)^{-1} \mathbf{e}_{2})$. Here, $\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\}$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Unfortunately, counting lattice points in real polytopes is hard . My question, now, is how important a contribution to mathematics would it be if one had an exact formula for counting $y$-smooth integers less than or equal to a real $x > 0$, i.e., an exact formula for the de Bruijn function $\Psi(x,y)$? This would, at the same time, translate into an exact formula for counting lattice points of real polytopes of the form $\textbf{conv}(\mathbf{0}, a_{1} \mathbf{e}_{1}, \dots, a_{n} \mathbf{e}_{n})$ with $a_{i} \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$.

Areas are values of integrals, and there are some kind of integrals in category theory (ends), but this is really just a wild guess. For some great examples of categorification see this list on MO, and for the meaning of categorification see this MO question or that article by Baez/Dolan. Inspired by the answers of Todd Trimble, we may consider a categorified sine function $$\sin(X) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} (-1)^{\otimes n} X^{\otimes (2n+1)} / (2n+1)!$$ in any complete symmetric monoidal category, at least if we can make sense of $(-1)$ . Perhaps $(-1)$ should be the universal invertible object $\mathcal{L}$ such that the symmetry on $\mathcal{L} \otimes \mathcal{L}$ equals $-1$ . In the theory of $k$ -linear cocomplete symmetric monoidal categories, this is the category of super vector spaces over $k$ , i.e. $\mathbb{Z}/2$ -graded vector spaces, with a twisted symmetry. Here, $\mathcal{L}$ is $1$ -dimensional concentrated in degree $1$ . Thus, we have a sine function for super vector spaces, namely $$\sin(V) = \bigoplus_{n \geq 0} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes n} \otimes V^{\otimes (2n+1)} / \Sigma_{2n+1}.$$ How does it look like, and can we extract something which resembles $\pi$ ? Maybe we can also attack $\pi$ more directly with something like $\pi/4 = \sum_{k \geq 0} (-1)^k / (2k+1)$ which may be categorified to $$\bigoplus_{k \geq 0} \mathcal{L}^{\otimes k} / C_{2k+1},$$ but again this is just a wild guess.","['number-theory', 'categorification', 'category-theory', 'pi', 'groupoids']"
17318,limsup and liminf of a sequence of subsets of a set,"I am confused when reading Wikipedia's article on limsup and liminf of a sequence of subsets of a set $X$ . It says there are two different ways
to define them, but first gives what is common for the two .
 Quoted: There are two common ways to define
  the limit of sequences of set. In both
  cases: The sequence accumulates around sets
  of points rather than single points
  themselves. That is, because each
  element of the sequence is itself a
  set, there exist accumulation sets that are somehow nearby to infinitely
  many elements of the sequence. The supremum/superior/outer limit is a
  set that joins these accumulation sets together. That is, it is the union of
  all of the accumulation sets . When
  ordering by set inclusion, the
  supremum limit is the least upper
  bound on the set of accumulation
  points because it contains each of
  them. Hence, it is the supremum of the
  limit points. The infimum/inferior/inner limit is a
  set where all of these accumulation sets meet. That is, it is the
  intersection of all of the accumulation sets . When ordering by
  set inclusion, the infimum limit is
  the greatest lower bound on the set of
  accumulation points because it is
  contained in each of them. Hence, it
  is the infimum of the limit points. The difference between the two
  definitions involves the topology
  (i.e., how to quantify separation) is
  defined. In fact, the second
  definition is identical to the first
  when the discrete metric is used to
  induce the topology on $X$. Because it mentions that a sequence
of subsets of a set $X$ accumulate to
some accumulation subsets of $X$, are
there some topology on the power set
of the set for this accumulation to
make sense? What kind of topology is
that? Is it induced from some
structure on the set $X$? Is it possible
to use mathematic symbols to
formalize what it means by
""supremum/superior/outer limit""  and
""infimum/inferior/inner limit""? If I understand correctly, here is
the first way to define
limsup/liminf of a sequence of
subsets. Quoted: General set convergence In this case, a sequence of sets
  approaches a limiting set when its
  elements of each member of the
  sequence approach that elements of the
  limiting set. In particular, if $\{X_n\}$
  is a sequence of subsets of $X$, then: $\limsup X_n$, which is also called the
  outer limit, consists of those
  elements which are limits of points in
  $X_n$ taken from (countably) infinitely
  many n. That is, $x \in \limsup X_n$ if and
  only if there exists a sequence of
  points $x_k$ and a subsequence $\{X_{n_k}\}$ of
  $\{X_n\}$ such that $x_k \in X_{n_k}$ and $x_k \rightarrow x$ as
  $k \rightarrow \infty$. $\liminf X_n$, which is also called the
  inner limit, consists of those
  elements which are limits of points in
  $X_n$ for all but finitely many n (i.e.,
  cofinitely many n). That is, $x \in \liminf X_n$
   if and only if there exists a
  sequence of points $\{x_k\}$ such that $x_k \in X_k$
   and $x_k \rightarrow x$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. So I think for this definition, $X$ is
required to be a topological space.
This definition is expressed in
terms of convergence of a sequence
of points in $X$ with respect to the
topology of $X$. If referring back to
what is common for the two ways of
definitions, I will be wondering how
to explain what is a ""accumulation
set"" in this definition here and
what topology the ""accumulation set"" is with respect to? i.e. how can the
definition here fit into
aforementioned what is common for
the two ways ? It says there are two ways to define
the limit of a sequence of subsets
of a set $X$. But there seems to be
just one in the article, as quoted
in 2. So I was wondering what is the
second way it refers to? As you might give your answer, here
is my thought/guess (which has
actually been written in the article
but not in a way saying it is the
second one). Please correct me. In an arbitrary complete lattice, by
viewing meet as inf and join as sup,
the limsup of a sequence of points
$\{x_n\}$ is defined as: $$\limsup
\, x_n =  \inf_{n \geq 0}
\left(\sup_{m \geq n} \, x_m\right)
= \mathop{\wedge}\limits_{n \geq 0}\left( \mathop{\vee}\limits_{m\
\geq n} \, x_m\right) $$ similarly
define liminf. The power set of any set is a
complete lattice with union and
intersection being join and meet, so
the liminf and limsup of a sequence
of subsets can be defined in the
same way. I was wondering if this is
the other way the article tries to
introduce? If it is, then this
second way of definition does not
requires $X$ to be a topological
space. So how can this second way
fits to what is common for the two
ways in Part 1, which seems to requires some
kind of topology on the power set of
$X$ ? I understand this way of definition
can be shown to be equivalent to a
special case of the first way  in my
part 2         when the topology on
$X$ is induced by discrete metric.
This is another reason that let me
doubt it is the second way, because
I guess the second way should at
least not be equivalent to a special
case of the first way. Can the two ways of definition fit
into any definition for the general
cases ? In the general cases,
limsup/liminf is defined for a
sequence of points in a set with
some structure. Can limsup/liminf of
a sequence of subsets of a set be
viewed as limsup/liminf of a
sequence of ""points"". If not, so in some
cases, a sequence of subsets must be
treated just as a sequence of subsets, but not
as a sequence of ""points""? EDIT: @Arturo: In the last part of your reply to another question,
did you try to explain how
limsup/liminf of a sequence of
points can be viewed as
limsup/liminf of a sequence of
subsets? I actually want to
understand in the opposite
direction: Here is a post with my current
knowledge about limsup/liminf of a
sequence of points in a set. For
limsup/liminf of a sequence of
subsets of any set $X$, defined in
terms of union and intersection of
subsets of $X$ as in part 3, it can
be viewed as limsup/liminf of a
sequence of points in a complete
lattice, by viewing the power set of
$X$ as a complete lattice. But for
limsup/liminf of a sequence of
subsets of any set defined in part 2
when X is a topological space, I was
wondering if there is some way to
view it as limsup/liminf of a
sequence of points in some set? It is also great if you have other approaches to understand all the ways of defining limsup/liminf of a sequence of subsets, other than the approach in Wikipedia.
