990790,Statement about $(I-A)^{-1}$ matrices,"Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and let denote $I$ the $n \times n$ identitiy matrix . Theorem. If $(I-A)$ is invertible and $(I-A)^{-1}$ is a nonnegative matrix and there is such a diagonal element in $(I-A)^{-1}$ which is less then $1$, then at least one of the elements in $A$ is negative. Question. How could we prove this statement? I've tried to use Perron–Frobenius theorem for $(I-A)^{-1}$, but after I've taken the eigenequation I don't know how to use the condition for the diagonal element. I've also tried binomial inverse theorem and Woodbury matrix identity but they also didn't help me. Although I think using these tools lead us far away.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'inverse']"
990794,$E[X^2]$ of the Beta Distribution,"So I know the Beta distribution is $$f(x) = \frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}\cdot x^{a-1}\cdot(1-x)^{b-1}$$ I know the $E[X^r] = \dfrac{\Gamma(a+b)\Gamma(a+r)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(a+r+b)}$ And I know plugging in $1$ for $r$ to get $E[X]$ (or $\mu$ mean) gives you $a/(a+b)$ because I know $\Gamma(n+1) = n\Gamma(n)$.

990829,Is this the wrong way to find $\delta$?,"Find $\delta$ such that $$|x^n - a^n| < \epsilon $$ whenever $$|x-a|<\delta$$ My thought is factoring $|x^n-a^n|$ so we have $|(x-a)|\cdot|x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}a+x^{n-3}a^2+...+xa^{n-2}+a^{n-1}|$ In order to make it smaller than $\epsilon$, I let $|x-a|<1$, so I have $$(a-1)^k<x^k<(a+1)^k$$ Thus, $$|(x-a)|\cdot |(a-1)^{n-1}+(a-1)^{n-2}a+..+a^{n-1}| <|(x-a)|\cdot|x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}a+...+xa^{n-2}+a^{n-1}| \hspace{0.5cm} (1)$$ so I choose $$\delta=\min \left(1,\frac{\epsilon}{|(a-1)^{n-1}+(a-1)^{n-2}a+..+a^{n-1}|}\right)$$ However, it strikes me that it might not be true, because inequality (1) might not hold when $a$ is negative.","['epsilon-delta', 'calculus', 'limits']"

And I know computing $E(Z^2)$ shows some links to the Gamma function/distributions and helps the integration and gives the answer of $1.$ However, I'm having difficulty figuring $E(Z^4).$
I know $\displaystyle E(Z^4) = \int \left[z^4 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^2/2}\right] dz,$
then I do 
$\displaystyle 2 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int \left[\frac{z^2}{2} e^{-z^2/2}\right] d\left(\frac{z^2}{2}\right).$ This is similar to the Gamma function $\Gamma(\alpha)= \int t^{\alpha-1} e^{-t}.$ 
However, my ""$t$"" in my problem $[(z^2)/2]$ doesn't have an $(\alpha-1)$, it's just to the first power. Any suggestions of how to manipulate it better to form a better gamma function to solve the problem for $E(X^4)$? Thanks a lot","['statistics', 'normal-distribution', 'probability']"

I realise now that spatial dimensions aren't required at all for the idea of trigonometry - because the whole concept of ""two-dimensional space"" can be reduced to either - the ""matrix system"" which compresses the concept of 2D space into a set of rules which can exist separately (albeit would seem very strange to a 1D life form), and similarly a space and time dimension.

The main idea is to decompose the map $[0,T]\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^d, (t,\omega)\mapsto X_{t\wedge\tau(\omega)}(\omega)$ into $M: (t,\omega)\mapsto (t\wedge\tau(\omega),\omega)$ and $(t,\omega)\mapsto X_t(\omega)$ (for all $T>0$).

991187,Show that $S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$,"The problem statement is: Show that $S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$ My attempt at the proof is as follows: Let $f:S^n\to\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}$ be defined as $f(x)=h(x)$ for $x\neq p$ and $f(x)=\infty$ for $x=p$, where $h$ is the homeomorphism between $S^n-\{p\}$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $h$ is bijective, $f(p)=\infty$ and $f^{-1}(\{\infty\})=p$, it's clear that $f$ too is bijective. We must show that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous. To begin, let $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}$ be open. Then $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ or $O=K^c\cup\{\infty\}$ for some compact $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. If $O\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ then $f^{-1}(O)=h^{-1}(O)$, which we know is open since $h$ is continuous. Now, if $O=K^c\cup\{\infty\}$ then we have $f^{-1}(O)=f^{-1}(K^c\cup\{\infty\})=f^{-1}(K^c)\cup f^{-1}(\{\infty\})=(f^{-1}(K))^c\cup\{p\}=(h^{-1}(K))^c\cup\{p\}.$ This is where I get stuck in the proof. What I want to say is since $h:S^n-\{p\}\to\mathbb{R}^n$, $(h^{-1}(K))^c\subset S^n-\{p\}$ and so we really have $S^n-h^{-1}(K)$, which is open because $h^{-1}(K)$ is compact, more specifically closed and bounded, since $K$ is compact and $h^{-1}$ is continuous. Afterword, I figure showing  $\,f^{-1}$ is continuous will be a similar argument. Another approach I wanted to take was to consider $S^n-\{p\}\cong\mathbb{R}^n$. Then since the one point compactification preserves homeomorphisms between sets, we must have $S^n-\{p\}\cup\{p\}=S^n\cong\mathbb{R}^n\cup\{\infty\}.$ In the text I'm reading, the one point compactification adds $\infty$, to add a different point, do we need to only confirm that $S^n-\{p\}$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space? That way, we satisfy the hypothesis for one point compactification? Thank you for any help or feedback!","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

For example, in his very first proposition, Book I Proposition I, he sets out to construct an equilateral triangle. Seems easy enough, right? He gives a construction involving two circles drawn at the ends of a line segment which is to be one side of the triangle and uses this to produce the remaining two sides. Trouble is, he has no axioms which guarantee that the circles will intersect, as they must to produce the third vertex of the triangle! Another, even more subtle, problem is that when you draw the segments to the third vertex, how do you know what you form is in fact a triangle? You need another axiom for that -- specifically, the problem is you don't know the sides don't meet somewhere else than the new point before they get there. This trouble was actually known even back in old Greece: Zeno of Sidon pointed this one out. So that makes me wonder: just what can you prove from Euclid's axioms, definitions, etc. without resorting to any hidden, ""obvious"" assumptions? If you can't so much as even get something as basic as whether the points you are attempting to construct by crossing lines and circles really exist, it seems the answer is ""not a whole heck of a lot!""

992334,Morphisms of quasi-affine varieties and locally closed sub-varieties,"The Problem Let $\varphi:X\to Y$ be a morphism of quasi-affine varieties. Let $Z\subset X$ be a locally closed sub-variety (that is, $Z$ is an open sub variety of a closed subvariety). Show that $\varphi|_Z:Z\to Y$ is also a morphism. Necessary Definitions A quasi-affine variety is a topological space $X$ together with an algebra of $\mathbb{C}$-valued functions $\mathcal{O}(X)$ such that: There is a homeomorphism $\psi:X\to U_X$ where $U_X$ is an open subset of an algebraic set in $\mathbb{C}^n$ for some $n$. The induced algebra homomorphism $\psi^*:\mathcal{O}(U_X)\to \mathcal{O}(X)$ is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. A morphism of quasi-affine varieties is a map $\Psi:X\to Y$ between quasi-affine varieties such that for every $f\in \mathcal{O}(Y)$, $f\circ \Psi\in \mathcal{O}(X)$. Discussion My first observation is that we should be able to reduce the problem to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are open subsets of algebraic sets, i.e. we can replace them by $U_X$ and $U_Y$ and suppose that $\varphi:U_X\to U_Y.$ (Although I don't know if this should be necessary) My biggest problem with this question is that I don't know what exactly the ring of functions $\mathcal{O}(Z)$ should be for a locally closed subset $Z$ of $U_X$. Abusing notation I will write $X$ for the algebraic set $U_X$ belongs to and $Y$ for the one $U_Y$ belongs to. I do know how to describe $\mathcal{O}(U_X)$ (or more generally the $\mathcal{O}(U)$ for an open subset $U$ of an algebraic set): $f:U_X\to \mathbb{C}$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}(U_X)$ if there exists an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U_X$ such that on $U_i$, $f=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in U_i$. Since $\varphi:U_X\to U_Y$ is a morphism, for all $f\in \mathcal{O}(U_Y)$, $f\circ \varphi\in \mathcal{O}(U_X)$, that is, there exists an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $U_X$ such that on $U_i$, $f\circ \varphi=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in U_i$ (*). Let $Z=U\cap X'$  where $U$ is an open sub-variety of $U_X$ and $X'$ is a closed sub-variety. By $(*)$ we have that for all $f\in \mathcal{O}(U_Y)$, 
there is a cover $Z=\cup_i V_i$ (With $V_i=U_i\cap U\cap X'$) such that on $V_i$, 
 $f\circ \varphi|_Z=g_i/h_i$ with $g_i,h_i\in \mathcal{O}(X)$ and $h_i(x)\neq 0$ for all $x\in V_i$ Is this equvialent to saying $f\circ \varphi|_Z$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}(Z)$?

992487,Problem on EU commission,"Consider the following problem. A collection of $n$ countries $C_1, \dots, C_n$ sit on an EU commission. Each country $C_i$ is assigned a voting weight $c_i$. A resolution passes if it has the support of a proportion of the panel of at least $A$, taking into account voting weights. Each country $C_i$ has a probability $p_i$ of voting for the resolution, and each country acts independently of the others. The problem is to assign the voting weights so as to maximize the probability that any given resolution will pass. I am interested in answering the question asymptotically under something like the following assumptions. The number of countries $n$ is very large. (Perhaps the EU's $n = 28$ is already not so far from this!) The proportion of votes held by any one country is bounded above by $M/n$, for some fixed reasonable number $M$. $p_i > A$ for all $i$. The probabilities $p_i$ are bounded away from $1$. Perhaps some of these conditions can be relaxed, or perhaps additional assumptions are needed, but these are the ones that seem to be needed for my arguments below. I have tried to answer the question in an approximate and non-rigorous way as follows. Let $X_i$ be the random variable equal to $1$ when country $C_i$ votes for the resolution, and $0$ otherwise. Now let $V = \sum c_i X_i$. By a suitably general version of the central limit theorem (the Berry-Esseen inequality?), $V$ follows approximately a normal distribution with mean $\sum c_i p_i$ and variance $\sum c_i^2 p_i(1-p_i)$. The probability that we would like to maximize is 
$$P\left( V \geq A\sum c_i \right).$$ If we let $F(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution, this probability can be approximated by $F(z)$ where
$$z = \frac{\sum c_i(p_i - A)}{\left[\sum c_i^2 p_i (1-p_i) \right]^{1/2}}. $$ Considering the gradient of the function $z = z(c_1,\dots,c_n)$ shows that $z$ is maximal when the weights $c_i$ are proportional to the numbers
$$\gamma_i = \frac{p_i - A}{p_i(1-p_i)}.$$ I conclude that it is plausible that the weights $c_i = \gamma_i$ are close to being optimal. My questions, in descending order of importance, are: Has anything significant been written on this problem, or an equivalent one? Is my ""theorem"" correct? What would a rigorous formulation of the ""theorem"" look like? EDIT: I've simulated the problem for $A = 0.5$ with 1867 countries with a 50.17% chance of voting in favour and 637 countries with a probability of 50.5%. I gave weight $1$ to each of the first group of countries and weight $c$ to the second. In the graph below, the horizontal axis is for $c$, and the vertical axis for the probability of passing the resolution. The blue curve represents the theoretical probability we would have if the normal approximation worked perfectly, and the red curve experimental data based on 5 million repetitions of the experiment. The maximum for the red graph is not too far from the conjectured optimal value of $\gamma = 2.94$. EDIT: In response to a comment, here are some additional details on the maximization of $z$ above. By homogeneity, it makes no difference whether or not we constrain the $c_i$'s to have sum $1$. But if we do, then a compactness argument shows that $z$ must attain a maximum at some point. Now return to unconstrained $c_i$'s. $\partial z/\partial c_i$ has the same sign as
$$\frac{\sum c_j^2 p_j (1 - p_j)}{\sum c_j (p_j - A)} \gamma_i - c_i.$$
This shows that where the maximum occurs, all the $c_i$'s must be proportional to $\gamma_i$.","['probability-theory', 'optimization', 'probability']"

Thanks for your kind and nice answers, I'm sure a good tip or starting point will suffice.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

I have the following hint, but I don't know how to work it. Hint : Show that the absolute value of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^n$ is less than $1/2$.","['fibonacci-numbers', 'sequences-and-series', 'divisibility', 'number-theory']"
992832,Expected Number and Variance,Practice Exam question. Not sure how to do this. The number of offspring of an organism is a discrete random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Each of its offspring reproduce in the same manner. Find the expected number of offspring in the third generation and its variance.,"['statistics', 'probability']"

992850,Inverse of an infinitely large matrix?,"This is probably a trivial problem for some people, but I've spent quite some time on it:
What is the inverse of the infinite matrix $$
\left[\begin{matrix}
0^0 & 0^1 & 0^2 & 0^3 & \ldots\\
1^0 & 1^1 & 1^2 & 1^3 & \ldots\\
2^0 & 2^1 & 2^2 & 2^3 & \ldots\\
3^0 & 3^1 & 3^2 & 3^3 & \ldots\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots
\end{matrix}\right]
$$
(Assume that $0^0=1$ for this problem). I'm not sure if this problem has a solution or is well-defined, but if it has a solution, it would help greatly in a ton of stuff I'm doing (mostly related to generating functions and polynomial approximations). I began by taking the inverse of progressively larger square matricies, but I didn't see any clear pattern.","['matrices', 'infinity', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"
992863,"Find the $\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n})$","Find the $\bigcap_{n = 1}^{\infty} (-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n})$ So the way I understand it is that I'm trying to find $(\frac{-1}{1}, \frac{2}{1}) \bigcap (\frac{-1}{2}, \frac{2}{2}) \bigcap (\frac{-1}{3}, \frac{2}{3})\bigcap ...$ and so forth. Then the intersection would be $\varnothing$ right? Can I prove this by just writing out the first few elements and seeing that they do not intersect? Or is the question asking me to find: $\frac{-1}{1} \bigcap \frac{2}{2} \bigcap \frac{-1}{3} \bigcap...$? in this case the intersection would still be $\varnothing$, right?",['elementary-set-theory']
992867,Show that $\int_{|z|=1} \frac{e^z}{z^k} dz = \frac{2\pi i}{(k-1)!}$,"I'm supposed to show that $$\int_{|z|=1} \frac{e^z}{z^k} dz = \frac{2\pi i}{(k-1)!}$$ where $|z|=1$ is traversed counterclockwise and $k>0$. We can parametrize this path as $\gamma(t)=e^{it}$ for $t\in [0,2\pi]$. Now I already know that if $n\neq -1$, we have $\int_{\gamma} z^n dz = 0$ by Cauchy's Integral Theorem (and $= 2\pi i$ if $n=-1$). I also know that $e^z$ converges uniformly on any closed ball $\overline{D_r(0)}$. Lastly, I'm told that $$ \frac{e^z}{z^k} = z^{-k} + z^{1-k}+\frac{z^{2-k}}{2!} + \cdots$$ converges uniformly on any annulus $\{z\in\mathbb{C} \mid r\leq|z|\leq R\}$, where $0<r<R$. I'm supposed to use all of these elements to calculate the integral, but I'm having a hard time putting all the pieces together.","['complex-integration', 'uniform-convergence', 'complex-analysis']"
