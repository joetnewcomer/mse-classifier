1609041,Convergence of $\int_0^{\infty}\sin (p(t))dt$,"Using contour integration, for integer $n\ge 2$, I could obtain the result  $$\int_0^{\infty}\sin t^n dt=\sin\bigg(\frac{\pi}{2n}\bigg)\Gamma\bigg(1+\frac{1}{n}\bigg).$$ With the definition $f(x) = \int_x^{x+1}\sin(e^t)dt$  and substitution $e^t=u$, $$e^xf(x) = \cos e^x-e^{-1}\cos e^{x+1}-e^x\int_{e^x}^{e^{x+1}}\frac{\cos u}{u^2}du.$$Because $|\cos u |\lt 1$, it follows that  $|\int_{e^x}^{e^{x+1}}\frac{\cos u}{u^2}du|\lt e^{-x}-e^{-x-1}$. Using this in the above equality one has 
$$e^x|f(x)|\le|\cos e^x| + e^{-1}|\cos e^{x+1}|+ e^x|\int_{e^x}^{e^{x+1}}\frac{\cos u}{u^2}du|$$
$$e^x|f(x)|\lt1+e^{-1}+1-e^{-1}$$ $$\implies e^x|f(x)| \lt 2.$$ Since $$\int_0^{\infty}\sin(e^t)dt=\Big[\sum_{k=0}^{N}f(k)\Big]_{N\rightarrow \infty}$$ and the series $2\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}e^{-k}$ is a majorant of the series in the RHS of above, it follows that $\int_0^{\infty}\sin(e^t)dt$ is convergent. Now consider an integral of the form $$\int_0^{\infty}\sin(p(t))dt$$ where $p(t)$ is a polynomial in $t$ of degree $\ge 2$. It seems likely that such an integral should also converge. My question is does this integral converge, and if it does, then is there a general argument that uses the above facts to show this? Also, what can be said if $p(t)$ were a rational function with no non-negative poles?","['complex-analysis', 'real-analysis', 'convergence-divergence']"

\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\vert f_{\alpha,k}(x)\vert^{2}\text{d}x &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\left\vert \frac{x^{2\alpha}}{(1+\Vert x\Vert^{2})^{2k}}\right\vert\text{d}x\\

1609276,Negation of injectivity,"I'm having some problems understanding the negation of injectivity. Take the function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x) = x^2$.

First it is solved the problem: $u''(t) + \rho (t) u= -f $ $u(0)=u(1)=0 \hspace{1cm}$ (1) Picking two arbitrary linearly independent solutions $u_1,u_2, u_1(0)=0$ $u_2(1)=0$ and using Variation of constants method to obtain a particular solution $u_p$. Then, by imposing to the general solution $u=u_p +a u_1 +b u_2$ the boundary conditions of the original (1) problem, it is found the solution that the solution to (1) is written in integral form as $ \int_{0}^{1} k(t,s)f(s)ds$. So it is defined the operator $K$: $$K:L^2([0,1]) \hspace{1cm} \longrightarrow \hspace{1cm} L^2([0,1])$$ 
 $$ \hspace{4cm} f \hspace{1cm} \longrightarrow \hspace{1cm} u(t)= \int_{0}^{1} k(t,s)f(s)ds$$ Where u is the solution to the ODE $u'' + \rho u=f$  (With the boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1)=0$) and $k(t,s)$ is Green's Function: $$k(t,s):=\left\{\begin{matrix}
- \frac{u_2(t)u_1(s)}{W(0)}& s \leq t \\ 
  -\frac{u_2(s)u_1(t)}{W(0)}& t\leq s
\end{matrix}\right.
$$ I understand the last part of the paper which uses spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators to solve the initial problem.
But I have a few  questions: It is shown that the operator $K$ is injective, so that for a given $f \in  L^2([0,1])$ there is a unique solution $u \in  L^2([0,1])$. Is this necessary? Couldn't it be shown using the fact that two different $\hat{u_1}, \hat{u_2}$ lineally independent solutions yield the same Green's function as $u_1, u_2$? Also, it is shown that if  $f \in  C([0,1])$ then  $u \in  C^2([0,1])$. This is done by derivating u in its integral form two times. Again, Is this necessary? As u verifies $u'' + \rho u=f$ then $u''$ is also continuous so that $u \in  C^2([0,1])$ as long as f is continuous.

1609777,Looking for a function $g(x)$ such that $g(2x+2) = g(x) + 2x+2$,"So recently I got bored in maths class (I'm in tenth grade) and made up a little equation that looked something like this: $$g(f(x)) = g(x) + f(x) $$ 
My original goal was to find different $g(x)$ to fulfill this equation for $f(x) = 2x, 2x+1$ and $2x+2$. I found solutions for the first two cases, but the third one keeps hiding its secrets from me and it's slowly taking my sleep. So if anyone of you guys out there who have some actual knowledge about the topic (I tried and asked my maths teacher and he didn't even know an answer for $f(x) = 2x+1$) could sort out how to find a fitting $g(x)$, please tell me. (There might be a general way to solve for any given f$(x)$?) I tried proving that a polynomial of some sort could solve the equation, but I stopped at third degree because it simply was too much work to write down all the formulas and I don't know how to handle all those terribly professional math programs like Octave etc. (I'm 15) Looking forward to some informative replies. Edit: I've already gained some really helpful insights here, but I still don't know why my original solution for $f(x)=2x+1$ wasn't correct. So, if anybody could give me a hint, that would be very appreciated. Here is how I got there: I assumed that the function looked like $f(x)=$ $(ax^2+bx+c) \over (x+1)$ because I found out that $g(x)$ had no value at $x=-1$. By just putting this function into our initial equation, we get
$${a(2x+1)^2+b(2x+1)+c \over x+1}={ax^2+bx+c \over x+1}+2x+1,$$ after simplifying
$$3ax^2+4ax+a+bx+b=2x^2+3x+1$$
We can now see that $a$ and $b$ have to be solutions to the following three equations in order to be valid parameters for our function $g$:
$$1: 3a = 2$$
$$2: 4a+b = 3$$
$$3: a+b = 1$$ When working out the solutions, one will easily find $a$ to be $2 \over 3$ and $b$ to be $1 \over 3$, thus our function $g(x)$ is defined as ${{2 \over 3}x^2+{1 \over 3}x}\over x+1$. For the test, we just put this function into our starting problem again:
$${{2 \over 3}(2x+1)^2+{1 \over 3}(2x+1) \over x+1} = {{2 \over 3}x^2+{1 \over 3}x \over x+1} + 2x+1.$$
Multiplying with $x+1$ (but still keeping in mind that $x=-1$ may never hold), we get:
$${2 \over 3}(2x+1)^2+{1 \over 3}(2x+1) = {2 \over 3}x^2+{1 \over 3}x + (2x+1)(x+1)$$
$${2 \over 3}(4x^2+4x+1)+{1 \over 3}(2x+1) = {2 \over 3}x^2+{1 \over 3}x + 2x^2+3x+1$$
$${8 \over 3}x^2+{8 \over 3}x+{2 \over 3}+{2 \over 3}x+{1 \over 3} = {2 \over 3}x^2+{1 \over 3}x+2x^2+3x+1$$
$${8 \over 3}x^2+{10 \over 3}x+1 = {8 \over 3}x^2+{10 \over 3}x+1, $$
which holds for all $x \in \Bbb R \ | \ x \neq -1$. I really don't know where my error is, and I am very grateful for every piece of help.","['polynomials', 'functions', 'quadratics']"

Obviously any finite linear combination $u(x,t)=\sum_{1}^n u_n$ of the functions $u_n$ will still satisfy the PDE and the boundary conditions, even though one cannot always - depending of course on our choice of f and g- find constants $A_n, B_n$ such that $u$ will satisfy the initial conditions. I am wondering what happens if one ""sums up"" all the functions $u_n$, i.e. if we consider $u_{\infty}(x,t):=\sum_{1}^{\infty}u_n(x,t)$?

Q:Is this function $u_{\infty}(x,t)$ a differentiable function and a solution of the PDE? Are there any instructive examples where this infinite sum happens to be not differentiable etc?

Then:
$$\sin^n(x) = \sqrt{\frac3n} + o\left(\frac 1{\sqrt n}\right)$$ And a further approximation here gives : $$\sin^n(x) = \sqrt{\frac3n} - \frac {3\sqrt3\:\ \ln(n)}{10\:n \sqrt n} + o\left(\frac {\ln(n)}{n\:\sqrt n}\right) $$
which is still independent from the initial value $x$ (assumed to be between 0 and π/2 for simplicity). I am using the method described in this paper to push it further :
$$\frac1{sin^2(u_n)} - \frac1{u_n^2} = \frac13 + \frac{u_n^2}{15} + \frac{u_n^4}{189} + \frac{2\:u_n^4}{189} +o(u_n^5)  $$
Now we can replace $u_n^2$ by its approximation $ \frac n3+ \frac{\ln(n)}5 + o(\ln(n))$
and sum from 0 to n (with $u_0$ = x ) Which gives me :
$$\frac1{\sin^n(x)^2}- \frac1{x^2} = \frac n3 + \frac{\ln (n)}5 + constant + o(\frac 1n)$$
and finally 
$$\sin^n(x) = {\bigg[\frac n3 + \frac{\ln (n)}5 + \frac1{x^2} + constant + o(\frac 1n)\:\:\bigg]} ^{-1/2}$$
Where x appears after the term in $\ln(n)$ and fades out as $n^{-3/2}$. The constant involves Euler constant and other limits of convergent series. Q: Is this wrong ? Did I miss something ?

1610359,"If these two expressions for calculating the prime counting function are equal, why doesn't this work?","So I've seen some different explanations of how the zeros of the zeta function can predict the prime counting function.  The common example is that $$\pi(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n}J(x^{1/n})$$ where $\mu(n)$ is the möbius function and $$J(x)=Li(x)+\sum_{\rho}Li(x^{\rho})-\ln(2)+\int_{x}^\infty\frac{1}{t(t^2-1)\ln(t)}dt$$ For future ease let's call $$m(x)=-\ln(2)+\int_{x}^\infty\frac{1}{t(t^2-1)\ln(t)}dt$$ I've also seen that $$\pi(x)=R(x)-\sum_{\rho}R(x^{\rho})-\sum_{n=1}^\infty R(x^{-2n})$$ The sums over the $\rho$ are for the complex nontrivial zeroes and the last term above is accounting for the trivial zeros and $$R(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}Li(x^{1/n})$$ My thought process was that I have two expressions for $\pi(x)$.  They must simply be different forms of the same thing, otherwise I could equate them and get something new.  So I equated them to see what would happen. (On a side note, I'm not really sure where the offset logarithmic integral is defined and where it is not. I initially assumed they were all the offset Li, but I'm not sure if that's accurate so please correct me if that's' wrong or if it even matters. Anyway let's take the first form of $\pi(x)$ and convert it a bit. \begin{align}\pi(x)&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}J(x^{1/n})\\&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}Li(x^{1/n})+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\sum_{\rho}Li(x^{\rho/n})+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})\\&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}Li(x^{1/n})+\sum_{\rho}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}Li(x^{\rho/n})+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})\\&=R(x)+\sum_{\rho}R(x^\rho)+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})\end{align} We know from the other form that $\pi(x)$ also equals $$R(x)-\sum_{\rho}R(x^\rho)-\sum_{n=1}^\infty R(x^{-2n})$$ Immediately the fact that one expression has a positive sum over the zeros and the other has a negative sum over the zeros hints to me that something's not right.  If we continue on, equating the two then substituting back to the $\pi(x)$ equation, we would get $$\sum_{\rho}R(x^{\rho})=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})+\sum_{n=1}^\infty R(x^{-2n})\right)$$ And from that, we get to $$\pi(x)=R(x)+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^\infty\left(\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})-R(x^{-2n})\right)$$ Interestingly, because $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}m(x^{1/n})=-\sum_{n=1}^\infty R(x^{-2n})$$ We circle back around, attaining only the approximation $$\pi(x)=R(x)-\sum_{n=1}^\infty R(x^{-2n})$$ Thus the result is seemingly trivial, however all of my steps seemed legitimate.

By the Yoneda embedding, suppose $A$ is a topological ring, if the functor $\mathrm{Hom}(-,A)$ is given, then we can recover the topological ring $A$ from this functor $\mathrm{Hom}(-,A)$. My question is, how to determine the topology of $A$? I know how to recover the set structure of $A$, and the addition and multiplication law on it. [EDIT] More precisely, as a set, $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb Z[X],A)$ is isomorphic to $A$, where $\mathbb Z[X]$ is with discrete topology. In this way we can recover the set structure of $A$. My question is how to determine the topology of $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb Z[X],A)$ only using the information of the functor $\mathrm{Hom}(-,A)$, such that the natural map $A\to\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb Z[X],A)$, $a\mapsto(X\mapsto a)$ is a homeomorphism of topological spaces? @crystalline said that we can consider the compact-open (?) topology on $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb Z[X],A)$, yes it recovers the topology on $A$, but I'm not satisfied with this answer, because if we give the compact-open topology to $\mathrm{Hom}$ sets, then for $A\to B$  a continuous ring homomorphism, I think in general the induced maps $\mathrm{Hom}(B,R)\to\mathrm{Hom(A,R)}$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(R,A)\to\mathrm{Hom}(R,B)$ are not continuous.

1610374,"Some heuristics about the Pisano Period, primes and Fibonacci primes. What reasons are behind them?","I started to read about the Pisano Period , $\pi(n)$ , applied to the classic Fibonacci sequence and made some simple tests looking for possible properties of the sequence . I have observed the following ones, tested for the first 10000 terms : $\pi(n)=n-1 \implies n\in\Bbb P$ $\pi(n)=(n-1)/2 \implies n\in\Bbb P$ $\pi(n)=(n+1)\cdot 2 \implies n\in\Bbb P$ $k \gt 5\ ,\ F_k \in \Bbb P \implies \pi(F_k)/4=k$ I do not understand the reasons for the results: points $1\sim3$ would work as a primality test, but it does not detect all the possible primes, only a subset of them, e.g. $\{2, 5, 47, 107, 113, 139,\ldots\}$ do not comply with points $1\sim3$ and are not detected. And specially the last point, if the test is correct, would mean that the Pisano period of a Fibonacci prime is exactly four times the index of the Fibonacci prime in the Fibonacci sequence when the index is greater than $5$ (being $F_5=5$ ) . For instance: $\pi(1597)= 68$ and $\frac{68}{4}=17$ which is exactly the index of $1597$ in the Fibonacci sequence, $F_{17}=1597$ . I would like to ask the following questions: (a) Is there a counterexample? Initially I think the tests are correct, but I am not very sure about point 4. If somebody could confirm would be great. (b) What are the reasons behind the observations? I guess that it is related with the relationship of the Pisano periods and the divisibility of the Fibonacci numbers by prime numbers . (c) If the observations are correct, would we find pseudoprimes in the lists of primes detected by the rules $1 \sim 3$ ? Probably the reasons behind the observations (if no counterexamples are found) are based on some simple properties of the Fibonacci numbers, but I do not see it clearly. Any hints or ideas are very welcomed. Thank you! Update 2016/01/14 : I have modified the information about point $4$ just to keep the correct information. After testing again, there are other $n$ 's complying with $4$ and not being Fibonacci primes, so I have rewritten the statement: the Pisano period of a Fibonacci prime seems to be four times its Fibonacci index (position in the Fibonacci sequence) but that also holds for some other numbers.

where the prime denote the derivative, and $a$ is a positive constant, $0<a\le1$.
This ODE is subjected to four initial conditions: $y^\prime(0)=y^{\prime\prime\prime}(0)=0$, and the other two $y(0)$ and $y^{\prime\prime}(0)$ will be determined by shooting (method) for boundary conditions (BCs) at infinity. To find the desired BCs at infinity, I try to figure out the far-field asymptotic behavior. In my problem, I know that the far-field BCs is quasi-steady behavior of this ODE. Case 1 . If I drop the first term and solve
$$\frac{5}{8}xy^\prime-\frac{1}{2}y+\frac{a}{y}=0,$$
I obtain a general solution
$$y=\sqrt{2a+e^{2c}x^{8/5}},$$
where $c$ is a free constant, and the negative one has been dropped due to $y>0$ in my problem. 
At this point, can I say the far-field asymptotic behavior is
$$y\sim e^cx^{4/5}.$$ Case 2 .
If I drop all the nonlinear terms in the ODE and solve
$$\frac{5}{8}xy^\prime-\frac{1}{2}y=0,$$ I got a simpler solution
$$y=cx^{4/5}.$$ In this case, I might say the far-field asymptotic behavior is
$$y\sim cx^{4/5}.$$ My first question is which case is right? Or both of them are wrong, how can I got it? Alternatively, if I requires $$\left(y^3y^{\prime\prime\prime}\right)^\prime \sim 0 \quad as \quad x \rightarrow \infty,$$
and let $y=Ax^\alpha$, by plug it in the above asymptotics, I have $$A^4x^{4\alpha-3}\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)=0$$
which yields $\alpha=0,1,2$.
Here, my second question is: could I say the far-field asymptotic behavior is
$$y\sim Ax^2,$$ because this is the fastest growing one? Update Thanks for @Frits Veerman's answer, I understand that the far-field behavior is not affected by the last term $\frac{a}{y}$, which is my ""afraid"" term. So come to my third questions: whether or not the following derivation is right? Case 3 .
Now, an alternative far-field behavior is produced
$$\left(y^3y^{\prime\prime\prime}\right)^\prime \sim \frac{1}{2}y-\frac{5}{8}xy^\prime \quad as \quad x \rightarrow \infty,$$
Again let $y=Bx^\alpha$, by plug it in above asymptotics, I have
$$\frac{1}{2}(1-\frac{5}{4}\alpha)=B^3\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)(4\alpha-3)x^{3\alpha-4}.$$
For this equality, it must have
$$3\alpha-4=0,$$ which gives $\alpha=\frac{4}{3}.$ 
Thus I obtain a different far-field behavior
$$y=Bx^{\frac{4}{3}}.$$ Am I right? I think this question is related to the perturbation solution of ODE. Anyone can help me, or recommend some famous books or journal papers to me? Many thanks! Regards, Robin","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'mathematical-physics', 'perturbation-theory']"

1610598,parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry and curvature,"In elementary geometry, we have two standard examples which violate the (strong) parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry: in hyperbolic geometry, we have more than one parallel through a point which doesn't lay on a given line, and in spherical geometry, we have no parallels at all. In both of these geometries, we have some kind of curvature: if we draw a triangle in Poincaré's disc model of hyperbolic geometry, the sides of a triangle can be bent inward and in spherical geometry, the sides of a triangle are bent outward. My question is: does the absence of the (strong) parallel postulate imply a geometry with curvature and does the presence of the parallel postulate imply the absence of curvature? I know that this question may sound really vague. It is motivated by playing with Euclids axioms and I don't have a precise mathematical definition of curvature in mind. Also, I don't have knowledge of differential geometry. I hope it is still possible to answer it somehow.","['curvature', 'euclidean-geometry', 'soft-question', 'geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

1610629,Kolmogorov's 0-1 law - Corollary from Loève's book,"Studying from the book Probability Theory by Michael Loève I came across the following corollary of Kolmogorov's 0-1 law, which is not proved: Corollary. If $X_n$ are independent r.v.'s, then the sequence $X_n$ either converges a.s. or diverges a.s.; and similarly for the series $\sum X_n$. Moreover, the limits of the sequences $X_n$ and $(X_1 + \ldots + X_n) / b_n$ where $b_n \uparrow \infty$, are degenerate. I don't understand the statement. I know that: $\limsup X_n$ and $\liminf X_n$ are tail functions. $\limsup \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{X_k}{b_n}$ and $\liminf\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{X_k}{b_n}$ are tail functions. The set of elements where $\sum X_n$ converges is a tail event. The set of elements where $\sum X_n$ diverges is a tail event. Consequently, applying 0-1 law, we have: My corollary. If $X_n$ are independent r.v.'s, then the set where $X_n$ converges and the set where $X_n$ diverges have probability 0 or 1; similarly for the series $\sum X_n$. Moreover, the if the limits of the sequences $X_n$ and $(X_1 + \ldots + X_n) / b_n$, where $b_n \uparrow \infty$, exist, then they are degenerate. However, from the first corollary I understand that the sequences always converges or diverges a.s. It also seems that they always have limits. Have I understood the corollary properly? Is it wrong?

so I have

$ Now I multiply the $x$ located right with 20 to make all denominators to disappear, so we have $4x+2x+5x+1500=20x$. I move the $20x$ to the left and 1500 to the right. As I do this, positive goes to negative and negative goes to positive etc... $

1610854,Closed subschemes of affine scheme,"In Mumford's Red Book (p. 106, 2nd edition, Theorem 3) it is proved that any closed subscheme $(f,f^\sharp):Y→X, f$ the inclusion, of an affine scheme $X=\operatorname{Spec}R$ is of the form $\operatorname{Spec}R/I$ with $I=\operatorname{ker}f^\sharp(X)$. The proof runs as follows: - may assume that the map $f^\ast$ obtained by taking global sections is injective - prove that $f$ is surjective (and thus a homeomorphism) - prove that the map of sheaves is injective, which is done by checking this on the stalks, i.e. $R_P\to \mathcal{O}_{Y,y}$ with $P=f(y)$ is injective for all $y \in Y$. Let $a \in R$ be in the kernel of this map and define the open set $U=\{y′\in Y\vert f^\ast (a)=0\in \mathcal{O}_{Y,y′}\}$. Then $f(U)$ contains some $(\operatorname{Spec}R)_t$ with $t\in R \setminus P$. Mumford then says that this means, $f^\ast (a)$ vanishes on the principal open $Y_{f^\ast (t)}$. However, I do not understand how one can make this conclusion without knowing that $f^\sharp$ is an isomorphism. By definition of $U$ (and the fact that sheaves are in particular separated presheaves), $f^\ast (a)$ vanishes on $U=f(U)$ and thus on $(\operatorname{Spec}R)_t=X_t$. If I knew that $f(Y_{f^\ast (t)})=X_t$, I'd be done; however I do not see a way of proving this equality or the inclusion $Y_{f^\ast (t)} \subseteq U$ not using the fact that  $f^\sharp$ is an isomorphism.

1610897,Significance of the notion of equivalent actions vs. permutation isomorphic action,"Let $G$ be a group acting on $\Delta$, and $H$ be a group acting on $\Gamma$. If there exists an isomorphism $\varphi : G \to H$ and a bijection $\psi : \Delta \to \Gamma$ such that
$$
 \psi( \alpha^g ) = \psi(\alpha)^{\varphi(g)}
$$
for all $\alpha \in \psi, g \in G$ then the two group actions are said to be permutation isomorphic . They are called equivalent iff $G = H$ and $\varphi = \mbox{id}_G$, i.e. if $G$ acts on two sets $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ and we have a bijection $\psi : \Delta \to \Gamma$ such that
$$
 \psi(\alpha^g) = \psi(\alpha)^g.
$$
So the conditions of equivalent actions is stronger. But why we bother about that stronger notion? Where is it essential? This question is related to my other recent question in which I asked for examples differentiating both notions. What I see there in the example provided in the answer, that just under the notion of equivalent actions we can for example conclude more specific about individual elements, for example that if it fixes a point in one action, then also in the other. So this makes it easier to count fixed points of a single element, under permutation isomorphic actions we just know that it is isomorphic to some other element fixing a point. But are there any other causes. Any theorems that rely specifically on the notion of equivalent action, and not just permutation isomorphic groups? I know that two actions on the cosets of some subgroup by right multiplication are equivalent iff the two subgroups are conjugate. By using that each action of a transitive group is equivalent to an action on some subgroup, this help in classifying all equivalent actions of some group. This is a nice connection, but still does not answer why we bother about classifying them, i.e. what's their significance in the first place? So to be more specific, do you know any theorem's were it is essential that two group actions are equivalent (either in its statement or its proof). Or any other intuitive ideas on the significance of this notion as opposed to permutation isomorphic?","['finite-groups', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-actions', 'permutations', 'group-theory']"

I would preferably do it using the tools of complex analysis, but since I haven't found any other thread dealing with this integral at all so far, I'd be open to any approach. I must admit that I haven't really found a way to start. The function $f(z) := \frac{\sin^2(z)}{z^2}e^{i t z}$ has an isolated singularity (a removable singularity, with continuation $f(0) = 1$, to be precice) at $z = 0$. I think a clever way would be to integrate over the edge of rectangle, semicircle or ""slice of cake"" (the edges of which we then would let go against $-∞$ and $∞$), then maybe somehow apply the Cauchy theorem or Residue theorem. But I don't know how to concretely do that, or how to even get started with that. On a more general note, I'm having trouble understanding how to transform a ""normal"" integral over a real interval into one where we integrate over the edges of a geometric shape; and I also don't know, based on which pattern one can see with geometric shape fits best. Are there any tips or hints on how to get more intuition for that? (Apart from, obviously, dealing with these integrals regularly, what I'm trying to do but where I'm still failing a lot of times.) I also noticed that the above integrals looks strikingly similar to the Fourier transformed of $f$ (or, even more similar to the formula for the inverse transformed). So maybe this could help us with this integral? I'm not really sure though.","['complex-analysis', 'integration', 'fourier-analysis', 'analysis']"
