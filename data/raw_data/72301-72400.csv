887418,Extended Calendar Cube Question,"The calendar cube puzzle is famous: using two six-sided cubes, label them such that any day of any month can be represented by positioning the cubes accordingly. The solution involves allowing the ""6"" and ""9"" to be represented by the same character. My question is an extension: is it possible, using 4 six-sided cubes, to represent the two digit month and two digit day of any day of the year? With the proviso that 6 and 9 not be represented by the same character . I don't know if this is possible or not, and the best I've been able to do is: cube1 = {1, 9, 5, 2, 3, 4};
cube2 = {1, 5, 0, 7, 8, 9};
cube3 = {1, 6, 0, 2, 3, 4};
cube4 = {1, 6, 0, 2, 7, 8}; This allows for any dates besides the following: 06/06; 06/07; 06/08;

However, from the limited calculus I know I thought there were methods to find the maximum of a mathematical function using calculus? I'd assume the reason genetic algorithms are sometimes used to maximize functions is because there are functions where the mathematical methods don't work. If I'm correct, what are those conditions? I'd guess that maybe it's because the function is not continuous or differentiable?","['optimization', 'calculus', 'artificial-intelligence', 'functions']"
887431,Replacing order of infinite sum and limit with some weaker form of dominated convergence,"Let $f(x,n)$ be some positive function of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb N$
Using dominated convergence theorem, with $\mu(A)=|A|$ as the measure, we can prove that if $f(x,n)<g(n)$ for any $x$, and $g(n)$ is integrable in $\mu$ (i.e. absolutly convergent), then $\sum\limits_i\!\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\!f(x,i)=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\!\sum\limits_i\!f(x,i)$. Assume that $\sum\limits_i f(x,i)<c$ for any $x>0$. Say that for any $\delta>0$ there exists some $m$ (we can also assume that for any $m$ there exists some $\delta>0$) and integrable  $g(n)$ such that for any $|x|<\delta$ and any $n<m$ we get $f(x,n)<g(n)$ (note that $g$ is not a function of $m$), and $\sum\limits_i\!g_m(i)<2c$. Is it still true that $\sum\limits_i\!\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\!f(x,i)=\lim\limits_{x\rightarrow 0}\!\sum\limits_i\!f(x,i)$? Edit:
We can assume the following: $f$ is bounded for any $x,i$ $f$ is uniformly continuous for any fixed $i$ $f$ is a function from $(0,1)\mathbb\times{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ For any $i,x$, $f(x,i)\leq\frac{1}{i}$","['measure-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'limits']"
887459,"Scary contour integral, but is also an integral representation for $\Gamma$-function","This problem is supposed to be from an old Acta Mathematica volume I circa 1880's, and is attributed to Bourguet. By using a parabola with its focus on the origin as a contour, show that: $$\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-ax^{2}}(1+x^{2})^{z-1/2}\cos(2ax+(2z-1)\tan^{-1}(x))dx=\frac{\sin(\pi z)\Gamma(z)}{2a^{z}e^{a}}$$ I am not a total cabbage head with contour integration, yet certainly not along the lines of Ron G, RV, robjohn, et. al. But, this thing looks nasty. Sometimes looks can be deceiving. I have never used a parabola as a contour. The closest thing I can think of is a Hankel contour. That is not exactly a parabola, but is commonly used with the Gamma function integral. A Hankel looks more like a bobby pin. But, if anyone would care to exert their contour integration prowess, it would be nice to see this one worked out.","['definite-integrals', 'gamma-function', 'integration', 'contour-integration']"
887469,A strictly convex function defines an implicit function with non-positive second derivative,"Problem. Let $F\colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb R$ be a non-negative, $C^2$ function which is also strictly convex, meaning that 
  $$
F(\lambda P + (1-\lambda)Q) < \lambda F(P) + (1-\lambda)F(Q), \qquad \forall P\ne Q \in \mathbb R^2, \,\, \forall \lambda \in (0,1). 
$$
  Assume $F(0,0)=0$. (1) Prove that the equation $F(x,y)=F(0,1)$ defines implicitly a $C^2$ function $y=\phi(x)$ in a neighbourhood of $(0,1)$ with $\phi(0)=1$. (2) Show that $\phi^{\prime\prime}(0)\le 0$. Point (1) is an application of Implicit function theorem. Indeed we have that
$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(0,1) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{F(0,1)-F(0,1-t)}{t} = \lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{F(0,1)-F(0,1-t)}{t}.
$$
Now using strictly convexity and $F(0,0)=0$ we have for $t \in (0,1)$ 
$$
\frac{F(0,1)-F(0,1-t)}{t} = \frac{F(0,1)-F(t(0,0) + (1-t)(0,1))}{t} > \frac{F(0,1)- (1-t)F(0,1)}{t} = F(0,1) \ge 0
$$
which is non negative by assumption. Therefore, $F_y(0,1) \ne 0$ and the claim now follows. Can I ask you what you think about this? Is this correct? EDIT : I am now doubtful about this first point. I have proved that the difference quotients are strictly bounded from below by a non negative constant. But this is not enough to conclude the derivative is nonzero, right? 
  I have just realized that $F(0,1)$ cannot be $0$ because a strictly convex function has at most one global minimum (which in this case will be $(0,0)$). Indeed, if we had $a\ne b$ global minima then 
  $$
f(ta+(1-t)b)<tf(a)+(1-t)f(b) \le tf(b)+(1-t)f(b) = f(b)
$$ 
  hence $b$ would not be a minimum. Is this eventually correct? Concerning point 2 I am a bit in trouble. If I am not wrong I have computed
$$
\phi^{\prime\prime}(0) = - \frac{F_y^2F_{xx}-2F_{xy}F_xF_y+F_{yy}F_x^2}{F_y^3}(0,1) 
$$
but I do not know how to estimate the sign of this expression... Could you help me, please? Thanks in advance.","['multivariable-calculus', 'implicit-differentiation']"

887491,Fubini's theorem and $\sigma$-finiteness?,"I'm reviewing my analysis notes, and I am really confused about what is meant by $\sigma$-finiteness being a hidden hypothesis of Fubini's theorem. Here is Fubini's theorem as was stated to me: Suppose $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ and $(Y, \tau, \nu)$ are complete measure spaces.  Consider the complete product measure space $(X \times Y, \overline{\Sigma \times \tau}, \lambda)$.  If $f \in L^{1}(d\lambda)$, then $\int \limits_{X\times Y} f d\lambda = \int \limits_{X} \left [ \int \limits_{Y} f d\nu \right ] d\mu$. I was also told that a measure space $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ being $\sigma$-finite is equivalent to there existing $f \in L^{1}(d\mu)$ such that $f > 0$.  This equivalence was easy to prove. I can't wrap my head around where $\sigma$-finiteness is ""hiding"" in this theorem (although my professor mentioned something about the ability to find a sequence of simple functions $s_{n}$ which is monotonic increasing and converges to our non-negative function $f$ -- this was a necessary step in our proof).

887560,"In a complete metric space with no isolated points, any countable intersection of open dense sets is uncountable?","I was playing with Baire's Theorem, and seemed to deduce the following: In a complete metric space $X$ that has no isolated points, any countable intersection of open dense sets is uncountable. Proof: Let $S$ be the countable intersection of open dense sets $\{U_n\}$. By Baire's Theorem $S$ is dense thus $U_n$ are open and dense. This implies that $U_n^c$ are nowhere dense. 
$$X = S\cup S^c = S\cup (\bigcap_n U_n)^c = S\cup \bigcup_n U_n^c.$$ If $S$ were countable, then $X = \bigcup_{s\in S}\{s\} \cup \bigcup_n U_n^c$. Since $X$ has no isolated points, every singleton set is closed and has empty interior, thus nowhere dense. We have just written $X$ has a countable union of nowhere dense sets. A contradiction to Baire's corollary. As a corollary, any connected complete metric space, such as $\mathbb{R}$, must be uncountable (this gives a topological proof that $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable). Also $\mathbb{Q}$ is not the intersection of open dense sets of $\mathbb{R}$. I am a little bit suspicious about my proof, is it correct?","['general-topology', 'real-numbers', 'baire-category']"

887671,What is the Riemann surface of $y=\sqrt{z+z^2+z^4+\cdots +z^{2^n}+\cdots}$?,"The following appears as the second-to-last problem of Stewart's Complex Analysis : Describe the Riemann surface of the function $y=\sqrt{z+z^2+z^4+\cdots +z^{2^n}+\cdots}$. This problem intimidated me when I first saw it as an undergrad, as the series under the root isn't the expansion of any function I know (then or now). That renders the Riemann surface more subtle than usual, since any info about poles and zeroes must be found from this series alone. For instance, it has a zero at $z=0$ and therefore a branch point. But there should be other zeroes — indeed, infinitely many zeroes — since the number associated with any truncation of the series grows as $2^N$!. This suggests that the Riemann surface of this function must be exotic. I'll give a sketch of an argument below, taking the pedestrian approach of hunting poles and zeroes of the function. However, I'd be glad to see an elegant and advanced perspective of the problem, particularly if it uses some ideas which I wouldn't have encountered as an undergraduate. The more food for thought, the better! EDIT: As noted by O.L.'s answer below, the series above is the canonical example of a lacunary function with the unit circle as natural boundary. What that leaves open is the nature of the resulting Riemann surface, which would seem to hinge upon the quantity of the function's zeros within the unit circle. David Speyer has given an argument in his answer that this number is at least 10. Is there a more definitive result on the zeroes of this lacuuary function?","['power-series', 'riemann-surfaces', 'analyticity', 'complex-analysis']"
887687,Eigenvalues gone wild,"I added some significant details to this problem, as it was apparently not clear to everyone what I want to know: This is a question about convergence of eigenvalues which essentially came up in studying the spectrum of St.-Liouville operators. 
We want to look at matrices that agree in most of their entries and want to investigate whether this implies convergence of the eigenvalues. We start with two matrices $$ A_1:=\left[ \begin {array}{cc}  3.5&- 0.5\\ - 0.5& 0.75
\end {array} \right] $$ with eigenvalues
$$\lambda_{1,1} := 0.661912511160047 \quad \lambda_{1,2}:=3.58808748883995  $$ and the matrix
$$ B_1:=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc}  3.5&- 0.5&-1/4\,\sqrt {2}
\\ - 0.5& 0.25&-1/2\,\sqrt {2}\\ -
1/4\,\sqrt {2}&-1/2\,\sqrt {2}&- 0.5\end {array} \right] 
$$
with eigenvalues $$\mu_{1,0}:=-0.9958877876 \quad \mu_{1,1}:= 0.6554756723 \quad  \mu_{1,2}:=3.590412115.$$ We observe that $\lambda_{1,1} \approx \mu_{1,1} $ and $\lambda_{1,2} \approx \mu_{1,2}$. Now, we extend our matrices to larger dimensions, denoting them as $A_{i},B_{i}$ ,in the following way:
So we get $A_i$ from $A_1$ by doing the following: (i) we use $A_1$ as the $A_i[n-1:n,n-1:n]$ submatrix of $A_i$. The elements down the diagonal are found from bottom to top by successive iterations in steps of two:
 So $A_i(n-2,n-2) = A_i(n-1,n-1) + 5$, $A_i(n-3,n-3) = A_i(n-2,n-2) + 7$ $A_i(n-4,n-4) = A_i(n-3,n-3) + 9$ and so on. (ii)Down the first subdiagonal all entries are $-0.5$ and (iii)down the subsubdiagonal all entries are $-0.25$. All other entries are zero! For the $B_i$ we use the same extension, but use the different basis matrix $$ B_i[n-2:n,n-2:n]:=\left[ \begin {array}{ccc}  3.5&- 0.5&-1/4\,\sqrt {2}
\\ - 0.5& 0.25&-1/2\,\sqrt {2}\\ -
1/4\,\sqrt {2}&-1/2\,\sqrt {2}&- 0.5\end {array} \right] .
$$ Notice that due to the fact that we use THE SAME iterative scheme to define $A_i$ and $B_i$ we get very similar matrices $A_i,B_i$.
So we get for example $$A_4:=\left[ \begin {array}{ccccc}  24.5&- 0.5&- 0.25&0&0
\\ - 0.5& 15.5&- 0.5&- 0.25&0\\ -

-1/2\,\sqrt {2}\\ 0&0&0&-1/4\,\sqrt {2}&-1/2\,\sqrt 
{2}&- 0.5\end {array} \right] 
$$ This matrix has the eigenvalues $$\mu_{4,1} = 0.6473654185 \quad \mu_{4,2} =3.540589910 \quad \mu_{4,3} =8.517603211 \quad \mu_{4,4} =15.51364936 \quad \mu_{4,5} =24.53079208,\mu_{4,0}=-0.9999999836$$ Obviously, the eigenvalues of $A_4$ and $B_4$ are extremely close together. Though, $B_4$ has an additional eigenvalue $\mu_{4,0}$ without a partner in the spectrum of $A_4$. So what I want to do is the following: By the iterative definition of these matrices we get sequences $(A_i)_i$ and $(B_i)_i$ with eigenvalue sequences $(\lambda_{i,1})_{i \ge 1}$,$(\lambda_{i,2})_{i \ge 1}$,$(\lambda_{i,3})_{i \ge 2}$,$(\lambda_{i,4})_{i \ge 3}$ and so on and eigenvalues $(\mu_{i,0})_{i \ge 1}$,$(\mu_{i,1})_{i \ge 1}$,$(\mu_{i,2})_{i \ge 1}$,$(\mu_{i,3})_{i \ge 2}$ and $(\mu_{i,4})_{i \ge 3}$.. . I want to show that $\mu_{i,0} \rightarrow -1$ and all the other eigenvalues converge to their partner value, so $\lambda_{i,k} \rightarrow c_k \in \mathbb{R}$(for i approaching infinity, hence going over to larger extended matrices) and accordingly $\mu_{i,k} \rightarrow c_k.$ Numerical simulations actually suggest that this happens ( I calculated up to $A_{150}$ and $B_{150}$ where I reached a pretty good convergence to the values already strongly suggested by $A_4$ and $B_4$, but I am not able to show it.)

887718,"Biggest subset of $\{1, 2 ... 1000\}$ such that difference between any pair of elements $\neq 4, 7$","The problem, as stated in the title, is to find the maximal size of a subset $V$ of $S = \{1, 2, ... 1000 \}$ such that no two elements of $V$ have a difference of 4 or 7 between them, i.e. $x \in V \implies x \pm 4,x \pm 7 \notin V.$ What I've done so far: first let's generalize the upper bound on $S$ and call $f(n)$ the maximal subset size for $S = \{1, 2, ... n\}$. I've conjectured that the optimal ""tiling"" pattern for such a subset is: $$\dots \\
        (x+11)+0, (x+11)+1, (x+11)+3, (x+11)+6, (x+11)+9, \\

     \dots$$ i.e. taking 5 elements for every cycle of 11. This would imply $$\lim_{n \to \infty}f(n) = \frac{5n}{11},$$ and hence $f(1000)\approx 454$. However, I don't know how to prove that this way of tiling the elements is optimal, and I also doubt this approach will yield an optimal packing to begin with (what about the edges of the set, around $1$ and $n$?)

I began thinking some more about the nature and behavior of $i$ and ran into some confusion.  I have seen the definition of $i$ in two different forms; $i = \sqrt{-1} $ and $i^2 = -1$.  Now I know that these two statements are not equivalent, so I am confused as to which is the 'correct' definition.  I see quite frequently that the first form is a common mistake, but then again Wolfram Math World says otherwise.  So my questions are: What is the 'correct' definition of $i$ and why?  Or are both definitions correct and you can view the first one as a principal branch? It seems that if we are treating $i$ as the number with the property $i^2 = -1$, it is implied that we are treating $i$ as a concept and not necessarily as a ""quantity""? If we are indeed treating $i$ as a concept rather than a ""quantity"", how would things such as $i^i$ and other equations/expressions involving $i$ be viewed?  How would such an equation have value if we treat $i$ like a concept? I've checked around on the various imaginary number posts on this site, so please don't mark this as a duplicate.

It seems like there should be slicker, categorical ways of proving these properties. If so, can we do this for other functors? If you'd prefer, here's a formal variant of my question, in the language of Milnor-Stasheff $\S$ 3: Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the category of finite-dimensional real vector spaces and isomorphisms between them, and let $T: \mathcal{V}^n \to \mathcal{V}$ be a continuous (covariant) functor.

887755,Interpretation of generalized eigenvector in orbits,"First of all, this is my fourth question about dynamical systems in a week, sorry for that. Considering a linear bidimensional dynamical (autonomous) system, the orbits can be plotted in the phase state as so: Let me specify that I already managed to solve the dynamical equations in every case (regarding eigenvalues), and plot similar orbits. My question is on the third image: there, there is one double (positive) eigenvalue. The dimension of the unstable manifold is therefore $2$. It is spanned by an eigenvector (here, $(1,0)$ for e.g.) and a generalized eigenvector. My question is, is there a link between the shape of the trajectories and a generalized eigenvector? For the eigenvector the link is quite obvious (also in the first and last cases in the figure), but I am not able to show a generalized eigenvector from the orbits. Thank you edit :
I wrote the dynamical equations for complex conjugate eigenvalues, and:
- the (un)stable manifold is of obviously bidimensional (stable/unstable manifold theorem);
- but nothing prevents me from trying to find a 1D-submanifold of the (un)stable manifold, by seeking a parametric curve of the form $(x,h(x))$ and writing that it is invariant ($h$ is written as its Taylor expansion up to a finite degree). The interesting thing is that there is no such curve! As I have not read anything about this, I'd be willing to have your opinions: in some cases (1 and 4 in the figure), the (un)stable manifold is of dimension 2, and two submanifolds of dimension 1 can always be calculated. If the eigenvalues are complex (not real) (case 2 in above figure), the (un)stable manifold is of dimension 2, but this manifold cannot be ""decomposed"" in two (un)stable submanifolds. I'm not sure what I'm taking about when writing about decomposition in submanifolds...

$$\|f\ast \mu\|_{L^{p}}\leq \int_{\mathbb R}\|f(\cdot-y)\|_{L^{p}}d\mu(y)=\|f\|_{p}\|\mu\|.$$

If $ f \in L^1 (\mu) $, there exist $ g \in L^1 (\nu) $ such that $\int_E f \,d\mu = \int_E g\, d\nu $ for all $ E \in N $. Let $ X $ the set of natural numbers, $\mu $ the counting measure, $ N $ containing just $ X $ and the empty set and $ f $ the characteristic function of the singlepoint $1 $ which is a $ L^1 $ function. Then, we have $$ 1 = \int_X g\, d\nu ,$$
for some $ g \in L^1 (\nu) $. But if $ h $ is positive and $\nu $-measurable function, we can take an increasing sequence of simple and measurable functions which converges to $ h $. By definition of $ N $, a simple measurable function is a linear combination of the characeristic of $ X $ and the empty set. So, the integral of $ h $ must be 0 or infinity. Then $ L^1 (\nu) $ is trivial, and we have an absurd. Is there something wrong in this argument? I can't see. And since he doesn't define sub-$\sigma $-algebra before (I'm assuming that is just a $\sigma $-algebra contained in the first), perhaps we need to assume more things.

888151,"Mean and Variance of ""Piecewise"" Normal Distribution","Note - I put piecewise in quotes because I don't think it's the right term to use (I can't figure out what to call it). I am building a program to model the load that a user places on a server. The load a user produces follows a normal distribution. Depending on which application the user is using, however, the mean and variance of that normal distribution will be different. What I am trying to do is calculate the overall mean and variance for a user's activity given the proportions of time they use each application. For example, Application A follows $\mathcal{N}(100, 50)$ and Application B follows $\mathcal{N}(500, 20)$.  If a user uses A 50% of the time and B the other 50%, what is the mean and variance of the data that the user would produce during a day? I'm able to simulate this by selecting a number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then generating a value from the appropriate distribution.  Something like this: $f(x) =
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{N}(100, 50), &0 \le x \lt 0.5\\
\mathcal{N}(500, 20), &0.5 \le x \lt 1\\
\end{cases}
$ When I simulate a large number of these values and measure the results, it looks like the mean is just $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n\mu_ip$ where $p$ is the percentage of the day a user is using each application. I can't figure out what pattern the variance follows or what the formula might be to determine it without measuring a bunch of simulated values (When I simulate the above example, the variance looks to be something close to 41500). I'd appreciate confirmation that how I'm calculating the combined mean is correct and some help in figuring out how to determine the variance of the overall distribution.","['normal-distribution', 'probability']"

$\kappa(t) = \frac{\dot c(t) \cdot \ddot c^\perp (t)}{\| \dot c \|^3}$ My proof: Let $\tilde c(s) := c \circ \varphi(s) \Rightarrow c = \tilde c \circ \varphi^{-1}$ be parametrized by the arc length with $\varphi$ orientation preserving. $\Rightarrow \|\dot{\tilde c}\| = 1$ From the definition of curvature follows with rotating both sides by $\frac{\pi}{2}$: $\ddot{\tilde c} = \tilde k(s) \tilde n(s) = \tilde k(s) \dot{\tilde c}^\perp(s)\\
\Rightarrow \ddot{\tilde c}^\perp = -\tilde k(s) \dot{\tilde c}(s)\\
\Rightarrow \dot{\tilde c}(s) \ddot{\tilde c}^\perp(s) = -\tilde k(s)$ Now I simply substitute: $
\dot{ c} = \dot{\tilde c} \circ \varphi^{-1} \cdot \dot \varphi^{-1}\\
\ddot{ c} = \ddot{\tilde c} \circ \varphi \cdot (\dot \varphi^{-1})^2 + \dot{\tilde c} \circ \varphi^{-1} \cdot \ddot \varphi^{-1}$ $
\dot c(t) \cdot \ddot c^\perp (t) = \dot{\tilde c}(s) \ddot{\tilde c}^\perp(s) \cdot (\dot \varphi^{-1})^3 = \dot{\tilde c}(s) \ddot{\tilde c}^\perp(s) \cdot \|\dot {\tilde c(s)}\cdot (\dot \varphi^{-1})^3\|\\

888250,Is there an algebraic-geometric solution to the problem of the Leibnizian formalism?,"The precise question appears at the end of this entry. With all the recent advances in understanding infinitesimals, we still don't fully understand why Leibniz's definition of $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as literally a ratio works the way it does and seems to explain numerous facts including chain rule. Note that Robinson modified Leibniz's approach as follows. Suppose we have a function $y=f(x)$. Let $\Delta x$ be an infinitesimal hyperreal $x$-increment. Consider the corresponding $y$-increment $\Delta y=f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)$. The ratio of hyperreals $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is not quite the derivative. Rather, we must round off the ratio to the nearest real number (its standard part ) and so we set $f'(x)=\text{st}\big(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\big)$. To be consistent with the traditional Leibnizian notation one then defines new variables $dx=\Delta x$ and $dy=f'(x)dx$ so as to get $f'(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}$ but of course here $dy$ is not the $y$-increment corresponding to the $x$-increment. Thus the Leibnizian notation is not made fully operational. Leibniz himself handled the problem (of which he was certainly aware, contrary to Bishop Berkeley's allegations) by explaining that he was working with a more general relation of equality ""up to"" negligible terms, in a suitable sense to be determined. Thus if $y=x^2$ then the equality sign in $\frac{dy}{dx}=2x$ does not mean, to Leibniz, exactly what we think it means. Another approach to $dy=f'(x)dx$ is smooth infinitesimal analysis where infinitesimals are nilsquare so you get equality on the nose though you can't form the ratio. On the other hand, Leibniz worked with arbitrary nonzero orders of infinitesimals $dx^n$ so this doesn't fully capture the Leibnizian framework either. Question: In an algebraic-geometric or other algebraic or analytic context (with suitable limitations on $f$), is there a way of assigning a precise sense to the Leibnizian generalized equality using global considerations?

Both of their eigenvectors form a complete set of $V$, but $\xi$'s eigenvalues are discrete, while $\eta$'s are continuous. How is this possible? I mean how is it possible that the same vector space has both an uncountably infinite basis and a countably infinite basis? This is taken from Dirac's Principles of Quantum Mechanics, he uses these kinds of operators without considering this problem, which buggles me. While thinking about this, I've realized, that the problem of Fourier-series is an example of the same vector space having two bases with different cardinality. A function which equals its Fourier-series can be viewed as a vector expanded in a continous basis in time domain and in discrete basis in frequency domain. So this problem is definitely not a contradiction, there exist vector spaces with countable and uncountable basis at the same time. Still, if a vector space is countably finite dimensional there shouldn't be uncountably many independent vectors in it, and conversely, if it is uncountably infinite dimensional, then a countably infinite set of vectors shouldn't be enough to span it. Last but not least we are considering a closed space equipped with a scalar product, so infinite sums of vectors are allowed.

888728,"Is $\tan(x)$ differentiable for $x\in ( -\pi/2 , \pi/2 )$","This is an assignment question and in class we taught the definition that: A function $f(x)$ is differentiable if we can find $f(x+h) - f(x) = Kh +h E(x,h)$, where $K=f'(x)$ and $E(x,h) \rightarrow 0$   as $h \rightarrow 0$ E.g. $f(x) = x^3 \Rightarrow f(x+h) - f(x) = (x+h)^3 - x^3 = 3x^2h+2xh^2 +h^3$
  and so $3x^2h+2xh^2+h^3 =Kh +h E(x,h) $. Thus we can conclude that $K = 3x^2$ and $E(x,h) = 2xh + h^2 $, and thus $f$ is differentiable since $E(x,h) = 2xh + h^2 \rightarrow 0$   as $h \rightarrow 0$ But for proving that $tan(x)$ is differentiable I started and got stuck: $\tan(x+h) - \tan(x) = \dfrac{\tan(h)(1+\tan^2(x))}{1-\tan(x)\tan(h)}$, I really want to find $K = 1+ \tan^2(x)$ but I can't find a way to get $(1+\tan^2(x))h$ without a fraction term, and $E(x,h) = 0 , h \rightarrow 0$.

888772,What's wrong with this proof of the infinity of primes?,"While reviewing an online textbook in abstract algebra for my website—which I'm hoping will go live by the end of the month—one of the exercises in the book inspired me to produce a simple, set theoretic proof of the infinity of primes. But it looks wrong! I can't say why exactly—but something looks off about it! If anyone can spot what's wrong with it, let me know, I'm too  tired to think of it now. If it's NOT wrong, well, you get to publish that for free, go ahead, I won't fight you for credit. But boy, I'd be shocked if no one ever thought of this and it's correct! There are countably infinite positive integers by definition. Decompose the positive integers into the following partition: the set of all primes and the set of all composite positive integers. Assume there are finitely many primes. Then there must be infinitely many composite positive integers because a union of finitely many finite sets is finite. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, each composite must be a unique product of primes. Since there is a finite number of primes, let's say $n$ primes, then there are at most $n!$ products of primes. Therefore, there must be at most n! composite positive integers. But that means the positive integers are a union of 2 finite sets and must be finite and this is a contradiction! There has to be something wrong with this proof, but for the life of me I can't see what it is right now. I'm probably going to kick myself when someone points it out—it's probably something really trivial. Any takers?","['elementary-number-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Well, I started my proof with saying aRb and bRc exists, and try to prove aRc exists. However, because of the condition that we have the sets X as subsets of A without {a,b}, we have to consider two cases. Case 1 is when $b \notin X$ and case two is when $b \in X$. The first case is not so difficult, as our premises aRb and bRc does not include b as well, hence case 1 follows directly. However for case 2, I am stuck. Thank you very much in advance.

888851,Essential support vs. classical support for a continuous function,"The essential support of a function $f:\Bbb R^n\rightarrow \Bbb R$ is defined in the following way: Let's denote $\mathcal A_f=\{\omega \subset \Bbb R^n: \omega \quad \text{open}, \quad f(x)=0\quad \text{a.e.} \quad x\in \omega\}$ and $A_f=\cup_{\omega \in \mathcal A_f}\omega$. The essential support $supp_e f$ of $f$ is $\Bbb R^n -A_f$. I want to show that, if $f$ is continuous, then $supp_e f=supp f$. My attempt: Now, let $\omega \in \mathcal A_f$. Then, there exists $N_\omega\subseteq \omega$ such that $|N_\omega|=0$, and $f(x)=0$ for each $x\in \omega- N_\omega$, and suppose that $N_\omega \neq \varnothing$. Let $x\in N_\omega$, so $f(x)\neq 0$. Since $f$ in continuous in $x$, there exists a ball $B$ centered in $x$, such that $f(y)\neq 0$ for each $y\in B$, so $B\subset N\omega$. Thus $|B|=0$, which is impossible. It follows that $N_\omega = \varnothing$. (Is it correct?) Then $f(x)=0$ for each $x\in \omega$, for each $\omega\in \mathcal A_f$ $(*)$.
From $(*)$ follows that $supp_ e f= supp f$. In fact, if $x\in supp_e f$, then $x\notin A_f$, thus $f(x)\neq 0$, that is $x\in supp f$. On the other hand, suppose that $x\in supp f$. Then either $f(x)\neq 0$, or $x\in \overline{\{x\in \Bbb R^n:f(x)\neq0\}}-\{x\in \Bbb R^n:f(x)\neq0\}$. In the former case, we have that $x\notin A_f$, so $x\in supp_e f$. In the latter case, there are points of $\{x\in \Bbb R^n:f(x)\neq0\}$ arbitrarily closed to $x$, and again, since $f$ is continuous, $f(x)\neq 0$, so we are again in the previous case. Is it correct? Or is there an easiest way to solve the problem?","['proof-verification', 'measure-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
888852,A topological function with only removable discontinuities,"I've posted similar questions here and here , but no one has answered them to my satisfaction. Suppose that $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is such that $\lim_{y\to x}f(y)$ exists for all $x$, that is, $f$ has only removable discontinuities. Then I claim the function $g: x\mapsto \lim_{y\to x}f(y)$ is continuous (see the first link above for a proof). I was wondering how we might extend this to a function $f:X \to Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are topological spaces. Suppose that besides just existing, $\lim_{y \to x}f(y)$ is unique for all $x$. (Or if we assume $Y$ is Hausdorff, we get that for free.)  Is $g:x\mapsto \lim_{y\to x}f(y)$ continuous? Here's a partial result I've gotten: Proposition: Suppose $f$ is as above, and $Y$ has the following property: $$\tag{1} \text{For every open set $V$ and every point $y\in V$, there }\\ \text{ exists a neighborhood $U$ of $y$ such that $\overline{U}\subseteq V$.}$$ Then $g$ is continuous. Proof: Let $V$ be open in $Y$, and let $x\in g^{-1}(V)$. Take $U \ni g(x)$ as above. Then the definition of $g$ implies that there exists a neighborhood $\mathcal{N}$ of $x$ such that $f(\mathcal{N} \setminus \{x\})\subseteq U$. Now $\lim_{z\to \xi}f(z)$ must lie in $\overline{U}$ for all $\xi \in \mathcal{N}$, so $g(\mathcal{N})\subseteq \overline{U}\subseteq V.\quad \blacksquare$ What are the simplest kinds of topological spaces that have property $(1)$?

I am now wondering if there is a shorter proof? Here is my proof: Let $x_n \to x$ weakly. By this result here $T$ is norm-norm continuous if and only if it is weak-weak continuous. Hence $Tx_n \to Tx$ weakly. Next note that because $x_n\to x$ weakly the sequence $x_n$ is bounded. Hence $S=\{x_n\}\cup \{x\}$ is bounded. Since $T$ is compact it follows that $Tx_n$ has a (norm) convergent subsequence. Let's call it $Tx_{n_k}$. Since strong convergence implies weak convergence,  $Tx_{n_k}$ converges weakly and since the weak topology is Hausdorff we use uniqueness of the limit to get that $Tx_{n_k}$ converges to $Tx$ weakly. Finally, since $Tx_n$ has the same limit in the weak topology and in the strong topology, $Tx_{n_k} \to Tx$ strongly.
