169032,Understanding the IMDb weighted rating function for usage on my own website,"I'm trying to implement a review function on my website, but I want it weighed. I checked on IMDb and they have this: weighted rating $(WR) = (v / (v+m)) R + (m / (v+m)) C$ where: $R$ = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating) $v$ = number of votes for the movie = (votes) $m$ = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 50 (currently 1000) $C$ = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.8) Now, I was wondering how I would implement it for my situation. So please help me understand if what I assume here is correct: $R$ = $\sum$(review of item $X$ * ratingvalue) / (total reviews of item $X$) $v$ = total reviews of item $X$ $m$ = I have only a few reviews on my site right now, so does it matter what number I provide here?  I thought I'd just enter 1 $C$ = which report do they mean by this?  Do they mean the average value of a review across all reviews? Example based on comments below (thanks guys): Let's say I have two movies with the following ratings:
Movie A votes: 8,8,10,5,7,8
Movie B votes: 10 Would that result in the following values for the variables:
Movie A total reviews: 6
Movie B total reviews: 1 Movie A sum: 46
Movie B sum: 10 Movie A average: 7,666666667
Movie B average: 10 Thus for movie A the variable values would be:
R   7,666666667
v   6
m   0,8  <- with value of variable m I could play based on whether this movie relatively has a lot of reviews
C   8 And the rating would be:
(WR)=(v/(v+m))R+(m/(v+m))C 
(WR)=(6/(6+0,8))7,666666667+(0,8/(6+0,8))8 
(WR)=7,7 If that's correct: I also tried giving movie A 6*10 and movie B 1*10 but in that case it would make sense to rank movie A higher, which it doesn't with my current formula. Thanks!",['functions']
169056,The completion of a noetherian local ring is a complete local ring,"We have defined the completion of a noetherian local ring $A$ to be $$\hat{A}=\left\{(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\in\prod_{i=1}^\infty A/\mathfrak{m}^i:a_j\equiv a_i\bmod{\mathfrak{m}^i} \,\,\forall j>i\right\}.$$
I have a slight problem trying to understand the proof that then $\hat{A}$ is a complete local ring with maximal ideal $\hat{\mathfrak{m}}=\{(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\in\hat{A}:a_1=0\}$. Proof. If $(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\in\hat{\mathfrak{m}}$, then $a_i\equiv 0\bmod{\mathfrak{m}}$ for all $i$, i.e., $a_i\in\mathfrak{m}$. Hence $$\hat{\mathfrak{m}}^i=\left\{(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\in\hat{A}:a_j=0\,\,\forall j\leq i\right\}.$$
So the canonical map $\hat{A}\to A/\mathfrak{m}^i$, $(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\mapsto a_i$, is surjective with kernel $\hat{\mathfrak{m}}^i$. Thus $\hat{A}/\hat{\mathfrak{m}}^i\cong A/\mathfrak{m}^i$. In particular, $\hat{\mathfrak{m}}$ is a maximal ideal. But why is it the only one in $\hat{A}$? If $(a_1,a_2,\ldots)\not\in\hat{\mathfrak{m}}$, we have $a_1\neq 0$, hence $a_1\not\in\mathfrak{m}$, hence it is a unit. By the defining property of the completion, $a_j$ is a unit for all $j$. So I could choose a candidate for the inverse of $(a_1,a_2,\ldots)$ by choosing inverse elements of the $a_j$. Why would this candidate be in $\hat{A}$ then, i.e. how can I choose it properly such that the congruences on the right hand side of the definition of the completion would be fulfilled?

169061,When are attracting sets invariant?,"Consider a control system of the form $\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t), u(t))$ where $u(t)$ is the control input, $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $u \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. Assume $f$ is Lipschitz continuous so that the existence and uniqueness of solutions holds. Following are the definitions of attracting sets and invariant sets that I use: A set $S$ is (control) invariant if for any initial state $x(0) \in S$, there exists a control signal $u(\cdot)$ such that $x(t) \in S$ for all $t \geq 0$. A set $A$ is (weakly) attracting with basin of attraction $B$ if for any initial state $x(0) \in B$, there exists a control signal $u(\cdot)$ such that $x(t)$ converges to $A$ as $t \to +\infty$, that is $\lim_{t \to +\infty} \operatorname{dist} (x(t), A) = 0$. It seems to me that attracting sets and invariant sets are closely related, in particular when $B = \mathbb{R}^{n}$ then in many cases, $A$ is also invariant. My questions are: Is there any example in which an attracting set is not invariant? Under what condition an attracting set is invariant? I come from the control community and not many control textbooks mention these concepts. If there are any good (math) books that discuss these sets well, please let me know.","['dynamical-systems', 'control-theory', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'set-invariance']"

169079,"If $V \times W$ with the product norm is complete, must $V$ and $W$ be complete?","Let $V,W$ be two normed vector spaces (over a field $K$). Then their product $V \times W$ with the norm $\|(x,y)\| = \|x\|_V + \|y\|_W$ is a normed space. Using this norm it's easy to show that if $V,W$ are complete then so is $V \times W$. To see this, let the limit of the sequence $(x_n , y_n)$ be $(x,y) = (\lim x_n, \lim y_n)$.  Then for $n$ large enough, both $\|x - x_n\|_V$ and $\|y - y_n\|_W$ are less than $\varepsilon / 2$ and hence $\|(x,y) - (x_n, y_n)\|< \varepsilon$. The other direction does (probably) not hold.

I realize that it's impossible to show both perfectly but how would you calculate the best scale? I would prefer a general solution for all situations like this (graphing sections with large differences on the same graph). Note this doesn't only apply to piecewise functions but any functions with large diff. in values. For example try graphing the points ${0,1,2,3,4}$ from $f(x) = 10^x$. (a difference of 9999 between the first and last point!) I am not talking about breaks. In a continuous function, I cannot show a break in scale because this gives an inaccurate model of the graph.

However P has been translated, rotated and translated back from the global coordinate system by theta degrees along the global x-axis. The following image should illustrate my point. I need to rotate my 3D line vector by a known angle theta to find the line between x0 and x2 . Can this be done by a set of transformation matrices (i.e. translate, x-rotate to global xy-plane, z-rotate by theta then x-rotate and translate back)? If so, how do I do this? I know the 3D vector equation is as below, but I'm not sure how to integrate that into the transformation. UPDATE: Thanks for the answers guys. I apologise for not making myself clear - my head's got in a bit of a muddle with all this! So I have a world system as in the 1st image, where the Z-axis faces vertically up. $P$ , the red plane section, is defined by it's normal (giving orientation) and it's distance, $d$ , from the origin using the equation $$\textbf{n}\cdot\textbf{x} = d$$ $\textbf{n}$ is formed using the rotation of the plane in terms of the global coordinate system. That is, assume that $P$ was flat along the x-y plane, as with the black one. It was translated to the origin, rotated by (e.g.) 25 degrees, then translated back. The actual problem I'm trying to solve is to simulate an object moving from the first (black) plane onto the 2nd (red). I know the direction and speed of the object's movement on the black plane, but I need to know it on the red. I know $x_0$ , this is the objects position at the intersection of the two planes. I can work out $x_1$ by simply taking the unit direction vector from one end of P to the other (call this $l$ ) and multiplying it by the object's speed: $$x_1 = x_0 + s*l$$ However, my object may not be moving directly up the plane as assumed for $l$ . We know the angle it's moving at relative to $l$ , call this $\theta$ .

169569,Universal property of the completion of rings / modules,"If $A$ is a noetherian local ring and $M$ an $A$-module, then we define the completion $\hat{M}$ of $M$ with respect to the stable $\mathfrak{m}$-filtration $\{M_n\}$ by $$\hat{M}=\left\{(a_1,a_2,...)\in\prod_{i=1}^\infty M/M_i:a_j\equiv a_i\bmod{M_i}\,\,\forall j>i\right\}.$$
See also my previous question . Now in the book I use (A SINGULAR Introduction to Commutative Algebra by Greuel/Pfister), there is no universal property of this completion mentioned, but once it uses something that looks like one: We have a map from $K[x_1,...,x_n]_{\langle x_1,...,x_n\rangle}$ to some complete ring, hence we got a map from $K[[x_1,...,x_n]]$ to it. Is that the 'universal property of the completion of a ring / module', and if yes, is it somehow obvious from my definition of the completion, so that we could use it directly?

169584,Completion of $C_c(X)$ with respect to $\|\cdot\|_\infty$,"Notation: All functions here are from $X$ to $\mathbb R$. $C_c(X)$ = compactly supported continuous functions. $C_b(X)$ = bounded continuous functions. $B(X)$ = bounded functions. $C_0(X)$ = continuous functions that tend to zero ( so $X$ has to be locally compact and Hausdorff ) Today I proved that $C_c(\mathbb R)$ is not complete with respect to $\|\cdot\|_\infty$. One can do this by taking $g_n$ to be the function that is zero on $(-\infty,-n]$, linear on $[-n, -n+1]$, $1$ on $[-n+1, n-1]$ and symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. For $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ one can show that $\|fg_n - f\|_\infty \to 0$ but $f \notin C_c(\mathbb R)$. Then I read about completions and wanted to work out the completion of $C_c$(X). (I did this all for $X = \mathbb R$). In any case, my thoughts were as follows: $C_c(X)$ is contained in $B(X)$. But it is a proper subset because the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous but there are discontinuous bounded functions. The next candidate then seems to be $C_b(X)$ but $f(x) = 1$ is in there and not the uniform limit of $f_n$ in $C_c$. (cannot be because if $f_n$ is zero outside a compact set then $\|f_n - 1\|_\infty = 1$ for all $n$ so this doesn't converge in norm). The next candidate then is $C_0(X)$ and I'm quite sure that that's the completion of $C_c$ with respect to $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ in $B(X)$. But now I need to show this by showing that $C_0(X)$ is isomorphic to the space of Cauchy sequences in $C_c(X)$ quotient Cauchy sequences that tend to the zero function and I don't really know how to think about this. Can someone please show me how to prove this? Thank you.

I am interested in the expected time to find a duplicate given only that the sampling process is pairwise independent. That is I would like to find the expected time until a sample matches one of the samples taken before. One way to compute the expected time is
$$E=\sum_{x=1}^\infty P(X \geq x).$$  Here $X$ is a random variable that represents the time at which the first duplicate is found. If the samples were fully independent then we would have that  $$\sum_{x=1}^\infty P(X \geq x) = \sum_{x=1}^\infty \prod_{i=1}^{x-1} (1-i/n).$$ 
We can bound this quantity using the fact that $e^{-2x} \leq 1-x \leq e^{-x}$ when $0 \leq x \leq 0.5$ and then bound the resulting sum using an integral. This gives an asymptotic bound of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ steps.

So we can define the connective constant $\mu = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} c_n^{1/n}$ that governs the growth rate of $c_n$, and if we happen to know a particular $c_n$ that gives a rigourous upper bound on $\mu$, namely $\mu \leq c_n^{1/n}$.

169845,Any affine algebraic group is linear.,"It is a well-known result that any affine algebraic group is a closed subgroup of some $\mathrm{Gl}_n(\Bbbk)$. However, I would like to see a proof for that, so I looked it up in various books, more precisely in Procesi, Lie Groups - An Approach through Invariants and Representations , the theorem on page 172 Borel, Linear Algebraic Groups , 2nd Edition, Proposition 1.10 Alexander H.W. Schmitt, Geometric Invariant Theory and Decorated Principal Bundles , Theorem 1.1.3.3 The proof is always more or less the same and always lacks an important argument (in my opinion). Let me give you a quick overview: If $\mu:G\times G\to G$ denotes the multiplication morphism and $\Bbbk[G]=\Bbbk[f_1,\ldots,f_n]$ then we may assume that the $f_i$ span a $G$-invariant subspace $V\subseteq\Bbbk[G]$. One can show that the comorphism $\mu^\sharp:\Bbbk[G]\to\Bbbk[G]\otimes\Bbbk[G]$ maps $V$ into $\Bbbk[G]\otimes V$ and thus,
$$ \mu^\sharp(f_i) = \sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes f_j $$
for certain $\psi_{ij}\in\Bbbk[G]$. One then maps $g$ to the matrix $\Psi_g$ with entries $\psi_{ij}(g)$. Now my question is: Why is this a homomorphism of groups? I can tell you what I have done so far. One may consider the triple multiplication morphism $\nu:G\times G\times G\to G$ which is just $\nu:=\mu\circ(\mathrm{id}\times\mu)$, so we get
$$\begin{align*}
\nu^\sharp(f_i) &= (\mathrm{id}\times\mu)^\sharp\left(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes f_j\right) =
 \sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \mu^\sharp(f_j)
\\ &=
\sum_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \sum_{k=1}^n \psi_{jk} \otimes f_k
= \sum_{k=1}^n \left(\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^n \psi_{ij} \otimes \psi_{jk}\right) \otimes  f_k 
\end{align*}$$
so
$f_i(abc) =  \sum_{k=1}^n (\Psi_a\Psi_b)_{ik} \cdot f_k(c)$. Conversely, we may also understand $abc$ as the product of $ab$ with $c$, so
$$\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^n (\Psi_a\Psi_b)_{ik} \cdot f_k(c) = f_j(abc) &= \sum_{k=1}^n (\Psi_{ab})_{ik} \cdot f_k(c).
\end{align*}$$
Now, what we need are elements $c_j\in Z(f_k\mid k\ne j)\setminus Z(f_j)$ to show that $\Psi_a\Psi_b=\Psi_{ab}$. I have a vague feeling that $f_j$ can not be contained in $(f_k\mid k\ne j)$ because $G$ acts linearly on $V$, but for some reason I am stuck. So my question is: Can you finish my proof, i.e. show that $Z(f_k\mid k\ne j)\setminus Z(f_j)\ne \emptyset$ or equivalently, $f_j\notin(f_k\mid k\ne j)$? If not, can you give an alternative proof?","['algebraic-geometry', 'group-theory', 'invariant-theory']"

The solution there works mainly because the number chosen is small enough for the sum of sum of sum to be equal to the repeated sum: i.e. if we sum digits further, the result does not change. Since finding repeated sums of digits is just a matter of elementary number theory, this solves the problem. It seems the following question might be much harder: what is the sum of sum of digits of $$4444^{4444^{4444}}?$$
In other words, let $f:\Bbb N_0\to\Bbb N_0$ be the function defined by $f(n)=\textrm{sum of decimal digits of }n$. What is the value of $f\left(f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\right)$? In this question, we have not yet reached a single-digit number, which at least seems to make it much harder. Some estimates: the number of decimal digits of $4444^{4444^{4444}}$ is equal to $$\left\lfloor\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}\right\rfloor+1,$$ which implies $$f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\le9\left(\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}+1\right).$$ Next, the number of digits of this last number is at most $$\left\lfloor\log_{10}\left(9\left(\log_{10}4444^{4444^{4444}}+1\right)\right)\right\rfloor+1,$$ which is $16213$, according to Wolfram|Alpha . Therefore, $$f\left(f\left(4444^{4444^{4444}}\right)\right)\leq9\cdot16213=145917.$$ So the number we are looking for has at most $6$ digits. This makes it very feasible to express in decimal notation, but possibly hard to find. We might be further interested in numbers like $$f\left(f\left(f\left(4444^{4444^{4444^{4444}}}\right)\right)\right),$$ so a related question would be: Is there any hope for a general method of evaluating such functions or is the behaviour of the $k$-fold composition $f^k$ completely chaotic?",['number-theory']

I have lots of trouble, because I need to do this on my own and my background in differential geometry and multilinear algebra is not strong. I shall try to explain how I would describe $K \otimes E^*$ locally, if somebody could comment on what goes wrong that would be immensely helpful! The canonical bundle $K$ over a Riemann surface $M$ is the cotangent bundle, or the bundle of holomorphic $1$-forms. In local coordinates $(z,\overline{z})$ an element of $K$ can be written as
  $$
\omega = \frac{i}{2} f\,dVol_h

  where $f$ is a holomorphic function on $M$ (or at least defined locally) and $dVol_h = \frac{i}{2}\, h dz\wedge d\overline{z}$, the Volume element induced by the metric $h\,dz\,d\overline{z}$ on $M$ (here again $h$ is a holomorphic function on $M$). Question 1: Is this a correct way to describe the canonical bundle locally ? The dual bundle $E^*$ can be described locally given a choice of basis $\{e_1,\dots, e_n\}$ for the bundle $E$. We take the dual basis $\{\phi^1,\dots\phi^n\}$ (so $\phi_k (e_l) = \delta^k_l$) and write
  $$
 \sigma = \sum^n_{k = 1} g_k\,\phi_k
$$
  where the coeficients $g_k$ are holomorphic functions locally defined on $M$. Question 2: is this description sufficient ? i fear the locality of what I want to show is not emphasized enough but i am not sure how the local coordinates $(z,\overline{z})$ on a patch $V \subset M$ (say) should be mentioned here. do i need to invoke local coordinates on $E$, or is this done by specifying the basis? Therefore the bundle $K \otimes E^*$ consists of tensor fields which have local description

\omega \otimes \sigma = \sum^n_{k = 1} (\frac{i}{2}\,h\,f\,g_k)\, dz \wedge d\overline{z} \otimes \phi_k

169961,Openness of $\varphi(U_Q \cap U_{Q'})$ in the definition of Grassmannian Manifolds (Lee: Introduction to Smooth Manifolds),"I am reading Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds and I have some problems with definition of Grassmannian manifold given in Example 1.24, p.22 . I'll write the details below. My question is: Why is the set $\varphi(U_Q \cap U_{Q'}) \subset L(P, Q)$ (i.e., the set of all
$A \in L(P, Q)$ whose graphs intersect both $Q$ and $Q'$ trivially) an open set?
(Which topology is used on $L(P,Q)$. Should I take the standard topology from $\mathbb R^{k(n-k)}$ and an identification of this space with $L(P,Q)$?) Here is the relevant part from the book: Example 1.24 (Grassmann Manifolds) . Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional
  real vector space. For any integer $0 \le k \le n$, we let $G_k(V)$ denote the set
  of all $k$-dimensional linear subspaces of $V$ . We will show that $G_k(V)$ can be
  naturally given the structure of a smooth manifold of dimension $k(n-k)$.
  The construction is somewhat more involved than the ones we have done
  so far, but the basic idea is just to use linear algebra to construct charts for
  $G_k(V)$ and then use the smooth manifold construction lemma (Lemma 1.23). Let $P$ and $Q$ be any complementary subspaces of $V$ of dimensions $k$ and
  $(n-k)$, respectively, so that $V$ decomposes as a direct sum: $V = P \oplus Q$.
  The graph of any linear map $A \colon P \to Q$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace $\Gamma(A) \subset V$,
  defined by
  $$\Gamma(A)=\{x+Ax: x\in P\}.$$
  Any such subspace has the property that its intersection with $Q$ is the zero
  subspace. Conversely, any subspace with this property is easily seen to be
  the graph of a unique linear map $A\colon P \to Q$. Let $L(P, Q)$ denote the vector space of linear maps from $P$ to $Q$, and
  let $U_Q$ denote the subset of $G_k(V)$ consisting of $k$-dimensional subspaces
  whose intersection with $Q$ is trivial. Define a map $\psi \colon L(P, Q) \to U_Q$ by
  $$\psi(A)=\Gamma(A).$$
  The discussion above shows that $\psi$ is a bijection. Let $\varphi = \psi^{-1} \colon U_Q \to
L(P, Q)$. By choosing bases for $P$ and $Q$, we can identify $L(P, Q)$ with
  $M((n-k)\times k, \mathbb R)$ and hence with $\mathbb R^{k(n-k)}$, and thus we can think of $(U_Q,\varphi)$
  as a coordinate chart. Since the image of each chart is all of $L(P, Q)$, condition (i) of Lemma 1.23 is clearly satisfied. Now let $(P', Q')$ be any other such pair of subspaces, and let $\psi'$, $\varphi'$ be
  the corresponding maps. The set $\varphi(U_Q \cap U_{Q'} ) \subset L(P, Q)$ consists of all
  $A \in L(P, Q)$ whose graphs intersect both $Q$ and $Q'$ trivially, which is easily
  seen to be an open set, so (ii) holds.","['linear-algebra', 'grassmannian', 'differential-geometry']"

170012,Prove that the dihedral group $D_4$ can not be written as a direct product of two groups,"I like to know why the dihedral group $D_4$ can't be written as a direct product of two groups. It is a school assignment that I've been trying to solve all day and now I'm more confused then ever, even thinking that the teacher might have missed writing out that he means normal subgroups. On another thread it was stated (as the answer to this question) that the direct product of two abelian groups is again abelian. If we consider the direct product of abelian subgroups $H$,$K\in G$ where $HK=G$ (for all $g \in G$, $g=hk$ $h \in H$, $k \in K$.) I can't understand why this would imply $g=kh$? It is not stated anywhere that $H$,$K$ has to be normal! But if this implication is correct I do understand why $D_4$ (that is non-abelian) can't be written as a direct product of two groups. But if it's not, as I suspect, I need some help! We know that all groups of order 4 and 2 are abelian, (since $4=p^2$), but only 4 of the subgroups of $D_4$ are normal: Therefor I can easily show that $D_4$ can't be a direct product of normal subgroups:
The only normal subgroups of $D_4$ is the three subgroups of order 4, (index 2 theorem): $\{e,a^2,b,a^2b\}$, $\langle a\rangle$, $\{e,a^2,ab,a^3b\}$ and the center of $D_4=\{e,a^2\}$ We can see that these are not disjoint. So $D_4$ can't be a direct product of normal subgroups. The reason for this being that the center is non-trivial. But why can't $D_4$ be a direct product of any two groups? If we write the elements of $D_4$ as generated by $a$ and $b$, $a^4=e$, $b^2=e$, $ba=a^3b$ why isn't $D_4=\langle b\rangle\langle a\rangle$ ? I calculated the products of the elements of these two groups according to the rule given above and ended up with $D_4$, and also $\langle a\rangle$, $\langle b\rangle$ is disjoint...?

170025,Duals via a Bilinear map,"Let $E$ and $F$ be normed vector spaces.  Then if $B$ is a bounded bilinear form on $E \times F$ then every $y \in F$ defines a bounded linear functional $f_y$ where $f_y(x)=B(x, y) \forall x \in E$.  When the bounded linear map $y \mapsto f_y$ of $F$ into $E^*$ the continuous dual of $E$ happens to be an isometric isomorphism, we say that $F$ is the dual of $E$ via $B$. (This can all be found in Dixmier Von Neumann Algebras)  Why is it then true that $||x||=sup_{||y|| \leq 1} |B(x, y)| \forall x \in E$?  He states both this and its analog with x, y interchanged, and E, F interchanged.

170054,Suboptimal confidence for bounds on the extreme eigenvalues of random matrices: can they be improved?,"Typical results from the literature of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) (e.g., Tropp'11 , Vershynin'12 ) provide probabilistic guarantees for large deviation of the extreme eigenvalues of random matrices like $\lambda_{\max}\left(\overline{X}:=\sum_{i=1}^m X_i\right) \leq \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^m\lambda_{\max}\left(X_i\right)\right]+ m\epsilon$, where $X_i$'s are $d\times d$ random matrices and $\epsilon$ is small positive constant. One of the common assumptions made in these analyses to establish the desired guarantees is that the random matrices are bounded from above with respect to the spectral norm or the largest eigenvalue almost surely . In some simple scenarios this assumption the confidence on the eigenvalue bounds is suboptimal compared to results obtained using different techniques. To be concrete let's consider a simple example. Suppose that $X_i = x_i x_i^\mathrm{T}$ where $x_i$'s are iid Rademacher vectors (i.e., the entries of $x_i$ are iid uniformly distributed $+1$ and $-1$). Note that satisfy the condition $\lambda_{\max}\left(X_i\right)\leq d$ almost surely. Applying the RMT results (i.e, matrix versions of the Chernoff, Bernstein, etc inequalities) generally provide bounds on deviation of $\lambda_{\max}\left(\overline{X}\right)$ (and $\lambda_{\min}\left(\overline{X}\right)$) that will fail with probability at most $\exp\left(-c_1\left(\epsilon\right)m/d\right)$ with $c_1\left(\epsilon\right)$ being a positive constant depending only on $\epsilon$ mentioned above. This is worse than the results that do not use the RMT and yield failure probabilities on the order of $\exp\left(-c_2\left(\epsilon\right)m\right)$. So my questions are: Is there something fundamental to the RMT analyses that yield these suboptimal results?  Under what conditions we can get sharper confidence probabilities like the example above? (on a slightly different path), assuming that random matrices in the summation are bounded is too restrictive, e.g., it even excludes Gaussian matrices. Is there any relevant result beyond the simple cases that doesn't need the boundedness assumption preferably with the sharper confidence guarantee?","['probability-theory', 'random-matrices']"

Since $a$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $a$. $$\vec{v}=\frac 1 a \vec{u}$$ If $\vec{u}$ were $\vec{0}$ then by $$\frac 1 a \vec{0}=\frac 1 a (\vec{0}+\vec{0})\implies\frac 1 a \vec{0}=\vec{0}$$
$v$ would be $0$ as well. Since it isn't by assumption, $\frac 1 a \vec{u}$ cannot be zero and so $\vec{u}$ cannot be as well. Is this fully rigorous?
