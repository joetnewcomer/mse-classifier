The point of this questions is that even though the midpoint approximation to an integral is generally better than the trapezoidal approximation, there is, for each $n$, a continuous function $f:[0,1]\to \mathbb{R}$ such that the trapezoidal approximation to $\int_{0}^{1}f(x)\,dx$ with $n$ trapezoids is better than the midpoint approximation with $n$ rectangles.

960971,Difficult algebraic expression for $f(x) = \frac{x-a}{bx-c}$ to find involutory solution,"So I read in another thread about involutory functions, he claims for any real numbers $a$ and $b$ , the function: $$f(x) = a + \frac{b}{x-a} = \frac{ax + (b-a^2)}{x-a}$$ satisfies $$f(f(x)) = a + \frac{b}{a + \frac{b}{x-a} - a} = a + (x-a) = x$$ And well, I thought I'd give it a try.

961000,A short question about the convexity of a function,"Let $x$ and $y$ be two numbers; $0\leq x \leq 1$ and $0\leq y \leq 1$ satisfying
$$\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}=\left\{(x,y):\sum^{\lfloor k\rfloor}_{i=0}\binom{n}{i}(1-y)^{i} y^{n-i} +\sum^{\lfloor k\rfloor}_{i=0}\binom{n}{i}x^i (1-x)^{n-i}=1\right\}$$ Define a function $f^n_k:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ with the mapping $\mathcal{X} \overset{f^n_k}{\mapsto} \mathcal{Y}$ Prove that for every $k<n/2$, the function $f_k^n$ is concave (or similarly for every $k>n/2$ the function $f_k^n$ is convex). For simplicity, $n$ can be assumed odd. Summary of what I've found (for $k<n/2$): $f_k^n$ is obviously continous and passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. $f_k^n$ passes through all pairs $(x,y)$ for which $y>x$ holds (except at $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, therefore $f_k^n$ lies above $y=x$ line on $[0,1]^2$. For every $f_k^n(x_0)=y_0$ there is an $\epsilon>0$ close point to $x_0$, namely $x_0+\epsilon$ such that $f_k^n(x_0+\epsilon)=y_0+\delta$ for some positive $\delta$. This proves that $f_k^n$ is increasing above $y=x$ line, but I dont think that it is enough for concavity. Here is the figure for $n=5$: Details of what I've done: The set defined above is the same with $$\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}=\left\{(x,y): B(k,n,1-y)=1-B(k,n,x)\right\}$$ where $B$ is the binomial c.d.f. Now let $h_0(x;n,k)=1-B(k,n,x)$ and $h_1(y;n,k)=B(k,n,1-y)$. I am able to prove that both $h_0$ and $h_1$ are increasing functions of $x$ and $y$ respectively. I know that in case $k=n/2$ then  $$h_0(x;n,n/2)=h_1(x;n,n/2)$$ One can see that we also have the following inequalities: $$h_0(x;n,n/2-1)>h_0(x;n,n/2)$$
and
$$h_1(x;n,n/2-1)<h_1(x;n,n/2)$$
From this point i conclude that 
$$h_0(x;n,n/2-1)>h_1(x;n,n/2-1)\quad\forall x\quad\quad (1)$$
BUT the condition of the set says that I need to find all $(x,y)$ such that $$h_0(x;n,n/2-1)=h_1(y;n,n/2-1)\quad\quad (2)$$ If $x=y$ or $x>y$ is assumed to satisfy $(2)$ then this is a contradiction for $(1)$. Accordingly I conclude that $y>x$ must be true for all pairs $(x,y)\in[0,1]^2$ except $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, which always satisfy the equality $(2)$. In the next step I assume the point $(x_0,y_0)$ is valid and satisfies $(2)$. Then II choose another point which is very close to $x_0$, i.e., $x_0+\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$. Then since $h_0$ is an increasing function of $x$ then I will have $$h_0(x_0+\epsilon;n,n/2-1)>h_0(x_0;n,n/2-1)$$ this says that left hand side of $(2)$ increased with adding $\epsilon$ to $x_0$ and for $(2)$ to hold, right hand side must also increase. We are lucky because $h_1$ is also an increasing function of $y$ therefore if $(x_0,y_0)$ is a valid point satisfying $(2)$, then $(x_0+\epsilon,y_0+\delta)$ should also be valid for some positive $\delta$. I used $h_0(x;n,n/2-1)$ for the case $k<n/2$ but I could use $h_0(x;n,n/2-a)$ for some $a$. The conclusion would not change. Thanks: Could you please help me?

961133,Probabilistic proof of green-eyed dragons logic puzzle,"I came across the ""green-eyed dragons"" puzzle (alternatively known as the ""blue eyed villagers"" puzzle). The typical proof uses a straightforward inductive strategy. I came up with a probabalistic proof, and I wondered if there are holes in it. The puzzle in its (possibly original) form can be found here: https://www.physics.harvard.edu/uploads/files/undergrad/probweek/prob2.pdf and the inductive proof here: https://www.physics.harvard.edu/uploads/files/undergrad/probweek/sol2.pdf . Theorem : All 100 dragons transform at midnight on the first night. Proof : It suffices to prove that each dragon independently concludes
$$\Pr[\textrm{exactly 100 dragons have green eyes}] = 1$$ Upon departing, we tell the dragons collectively that at least one of
them has green eyes. Specifically, we impart the knowledge that
$$\Pr[\textrm{at least 1 dragon has green eyes}] = 1$$ Define $L_i$ to be the event that at least $i$ dragons have green eyes, and $E_i$ to be the event that exactly $i$ dragons have green eyes. Then the above probability can be restated as: \begin{align*}
\Pr[L_1] = {100 \choose 1} \Pr[E_1] + {100 \choose 2} \Pr[E_2] + \dots + {100 \choose 100} \Pr[E_{100}]
\end{align*} Because each dragon observes the eye color of every other dragon except himself, each dragon concludes independently that: \begin{align*} 
\Pr[E_0] = \Pr[E_1] = \Pr[E_2] = \dots = \Pr[E_{98}] = 0
\end{align*} Therefore, each dragon concludes \begin{align*}
\Pr[L_1] = {100 \choose 99} \Pr[E_{99}] + \Pr[E_{100}] = 1
\end{align*} Note that \begin{align*}
\Pr[E_{99}] &= 1-\left(\Pr[E_0] + {100 \choose 1}\Pr[E_1] + \dots + {100 \choose 98}\Pr[E_{98}] + \Pr[E_{100}]\right) \\
&= 1- \Pr[E_{100}]
\end{align*} Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
{100 \choose 99} \Pr[E_{99}] + \Pr[E_{100}] &= 1 \\
100(1-\Pr[E_{100}]) + \Pr[E_{100}] &= 1 \\
100 - 99\Pr[E_{100}] &= 1 \\
\Pr[E_{100}] &= 1
\end{align*} Thus, each dragon individually concludes that with probability 1, all
100 dragons have green eyes (including himself). This reasoning
happens simultaneously across all dragons, and thus they all transform
together on the first midnight, QED.","['puzzle', 'recreational-mathematics', 'probability', 'solution-verification']"

961341,A differentiable map doesn't depend on the parametrization,"In Do Carmo's Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces there's an excercise in section 2-3 that says: Prove that the definition of a differentiable map between surfaces does not depend on the parametrization chosen. According to the book, the definition of a differentiable map is, if $\varphi:S_1\to S_2$ is a continuous map, where both $S_1,S_2$ are regular surfaces. then $\varphi$ is differentiable at $p\in S_1$ if given parametrizations: $f:U \subset\Bbb R^2\to S_1$ and $g:W \subset\Bbb R^2\to S_2$, with $p\in f(U)$ and $\varphi(f(U))\subset g(W)$, the map $g^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f: U\to W$ is differentiable at $q=f^{-1}(p)$. I'm getting a little bit confused on how to prove this without making a mess. I'm relying on the following diagram: Where $f_1,f_2$ are two diferent parametrizations for $S_1$, and $g_1,g_2$ are two diferent parametrizations for $S_2$. And my guess is that we have to prove that $g_1^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_1=g_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_2$, althought would it be also necesary to prove $g_1^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_2=g_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_1$? Am I considering this wrong? An attempt to do this: We know that $f_1=f_2\circ f_2^{-1}\circ f_1$ and $g_1^{-1}=(g_2\circ g_2^{-1}\circ g_1)^{-1}=g_1^{-1}\circ g_2\circ g_2^{-1}$, hence 
$$g_1^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_1=(g_1^{-1}\circ g_2\circ g_2^{-1}) \circ\varphi\circ (f_2\circ f_2^{-1}\circ f_1)
\\=g_1^{-1}\circ g_2\circ (g_2^{-1} \circ\varphi\circ f_2)\circ f_2^{-1}\circ f_1
\\=G \circ (g_2^{-1} \circ\varphi\circ f_2)\circ F$$ because $S_1,S_2$ are regular, then  $F,G$ are diff. but I'm not sure what to do from here, can we conclude that $g_1^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_1\subseteq g_2^{-1}\circ\varphi\circ f_2$?",['differential-geometry']

$$g(x)=
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{f(x)}, & f(x) \not= 0 \\
0, & f(x)=0 \\

$$
Show that $g(x)$ is also measurable. Here's my reasoning so far: I have to show that the preimage $g^{-1}(S)$ of an open set $S$ is measurable. If we first assume that $S$ does not contain $0$, we get $$g^{-1}(S) = \{x \mid g(x) \in S \} = \{x \mid \frac{1}{f(x)} \in S \} = \{x \mid f(x) \in S' \},$$
where $S' = \{\frac{1}{s} \mid s \in S\}$. Now since $f$ was measurable and $S'$ is an open set, the rightmost expression must be a measurable set. (I think you can also show that the composition of a measurable function and a continuous function is again measurable, that would be even shorter.) I think I probably got that part right, but now I'm stuck on what to do if $0 \in S$. My first idea was that we could write $g^{-1}(S)$ as a union of two sets in the following way: $$g^{-1}(S) = g^{-1}(S-\{0\}) \cup g^{-1}(0)$$ If this is a union of measurable sets, then it is measurable. But how do I know that $g^{-1}(0)=f^{-1}(0)$ is a measurable set? I know that the preimage of any open set is measurable, but the singleton $\{0\}$ isn't open, right?

Are there any other such functions?","In particular, I was musing on this trick for swapping two values in a program without allocating any new variables. Wikipedia proves its correctness , and the proof picqued my curiosity. It relies on the following four properties of XOR: Commutativity: $A \oplus B = B \oplus A$ Associativity: $(A \oplus B) \oplus C = A \oplus (B \oplus C)$ Identity exists: there is a bit string, 0, (of length N) such that $A \oplus 0 = A$ for any $A$ Each element is its own inverse: for each $A$, $A \oplus A = 0$. I suspect that it'd be trivial to construct another group for which those four properties of XOR hold, so I'm not interested in the assertion that other such groups exist . Instead, I ask: Are there any other functions over bit strings that satisfy these same properties? If so, what are some examples? If not, can we prove that?

The problem is that I haven't studied rigorously in the previous basic probability class. I think it's because the professor just wanted to nurture us the intuition and become prepared to be rigorous after having learned the Measure Theory (I'm just guessing here). And the current stochastic probability class is mainly dealing with a general probability space, Martingale and Marcov chains, so I somewhat feel there is a gap between the two classes (our textbook is Basic Stochastic Processes by Brzezniak and Zastawniak, a small book indeed). So I want a book that covers the whole probability theory in a rigorous framework. For example, we haven't proved the central limit theorem or had gone deep into the probability generating function. I know what a Poisson point process is, but we used it only to solve some questions. But, as far as I know, without measure theory I cannot understand those concepts any deeper, am I right?

On the other hand I found in various references, such as Fulton's Algebraic Curves, that the length is taken over $k$, the residue field of $\mathcal{O}_P$. Since $k$ embeds in $\mathcal{O}_P$ naturally, I can see any sequence of $\mathcal{O}_P$-modules as sequence of $k$-modules and then I get that the length over $k$ is grater or equal than the length over $\mathcal{O}_P$.

961922,Second (and higher) derivatives of maps between manifolds,"I'm trying to understand derivatives of maps between manifolds, and specifically something I read in Dodson and Poston's Tensor Geometry . I'll try to provide as much background as I can for those without the book (for anyone who has the second edition the relevant section is VII.2... pages 166-168 in my copy). For starters, if $(U, \phi)$ and $(U', \phi')$ are charts on a manifold M (e.g., $\phi: U \subset M \to \mathbb{R}^m$), $u \in U \cap U'$, and $\vec{t}, \vec{t}'$ tangent vectors to $\mathbb{R}^m$, then tangent vectors to $M$ (elements of $T_uM$) are an equivalence class of triples defined by a relation $\sim$ given by $$
(U,\phi,\vec{t}) \sim (U', \phi', \vec{t}') \iff D_{\phi(u)}(\phi' \circ \phi^{-1})\vec{t} = \vec{t}'.
$$ If $f : M \to N$ is differentiable at $u$, and $(V, \psi)$ is a chart on $N$ (say $\psi : V \to \mathbb{R}^n$) with $f(u) \in V$, then $$
\begin{align*}
(U,\phi,\vec{t}) &\sim (U', \phi', \vec{t}') \\
&\Rightarrow
D_{\phi(u)}(\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})\vec{t} = D_{\phi(u)}(\psi \circ f \circ \phi'^{-1})\vec{t}' \\
&\Rightarrow
(V,\psi,D_{\phi(u)}(\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})\vec{t}) \sim (V,\psi,D_{\phi(u)}(\psi \circ f \circ \phi'^{-1})\vec{t}')
\end{align*}
$$ so that $f$ induces a well defined map $$
D_uf : T_uM \to T_{f(u)}N
$$ taking the $\sim$ equivalence class of $(U,\phi,\vec{t})$ to that of $(V,\psi,D_{\phi(u)}(\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1})\vec{t})$. Note that here $D_{\phi(u)}$ is just the regular derivative... as I understand what's going on, we basically create a map $\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$  and take its derivative. The result (in combination with the arbitrary chart $\psi$) uniquely specifies the tangent vector to $N$ for a given tangent vector to $M$ (answering the question: as we move in some direction on $M$, what direction are we moving on $N$?). The above construction can easily be extended to higher derivatives, by simply taking more derivatives of $\psi \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$. Dodson and Poston say ""In a similar way we can define higher derivatives, with $D^k_uf \in L^k(T_uM;T_{f(u)}N)$"". $L^k(T_uM;T_{f(u)}N)$ is the space of multilinear mappings taking in $k$ vectors in $T_uM$ and returning a vector in $T_{f(u)}N$. Moving towards my questions. Consider a map $g : U \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to V \subset S^2$. Following the above, $D^2_u(g)(\vec{t},\vec{t}') : T_u \mathbb{R}^2 \times T_u \mathbb{R}^2 \to T_{g(u)}S^2$, i.e. after feeding it two vectors we get a vector tangent to the sphere. This doesn't seem to be what you get if you take derivatives of $\iota \circ g : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$, i.e., considering the sphere as embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ ($\iota$ being the inclusion map). Fixing $\vec{t}$, after the first derivative we have a field of tangent vectors to the sphere at each point $g(x)$ for $x \in U$, and the second derivative I presume looks at how this field changes with position (yielding vectors no longer necessarily tangent to the sphere, since we're using just a regular and not covariant derivative). My questions : I think my confusion festers somewhere in that last paragraph. Are second derivatives of $g$ and $\iota \circ g$ not the same because the second derivative of the inclusion map is not the inclusion map between the relevant tangent spaces (i.e., chain rule)? Is my picture of the second derivative of $\iota \circ g$ incorrect or misleading? What does $D^2_u(f)$ actually tell us about $f$? Is there some intuitive question that can be formulated like in the first derivative case, which tells us how we move on N under $f$ as we move on M? Any and all help in untying my knotty brain would be greatly appreciated.","['manifolds', 'derivatives', 'differential-geometry']"

If it moves 1 square north, south, east or west; it requires $1$ unit energy.
If it moves to one of its diagonal neighbor (NE, NW, SE, SW); it requires $\sqrt 2$ units of energy.
It is equally likely to move in any of the eight directions.
If it initially has $20$ units of energy, find the probability that, after using the maximum possible energy, the ant will be $2$ units away from its initial position. Assumption If in case it doesn't have enough energy to move in a particular set of directions, it will move in any of the other directions with equal probability. I approached this problem, considering that the case that it finally ends up $2$ units to the east (we can multiply by four to get all the cases). If it ends up $2$ units to the east, then $\text{Total steps to right}=2+\text{Total steps to left}$ . We will somehow balance these steps, considering that the ant has a total of $20$ units of energy at the start. I don't know how to effectively calculate the sample space either. If the ant takes a total of $n$ steps, such that while taking all $n$ steps it is equally likely to move in any of the eight directions, then the sample space would be $8^n$ . But here we do not know $n$ . Further, if the energy left after the second-last step is less than $\sqrt 2$ and more than $1$ , then the ant will not be able to move diagonally.

Then consider $$\left(\bigcup_{r_n \in S, r_n \neq0,1}B(r_n,p)\right)\cup 0\cup 1$$ is an open cover of $S$. But there exists no finite subcover. Thus, $S$ is not compact in $[0,1]$. Apart from the above question, if I change the metric space from $[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{R}$, can I still make the same conclusion? This confuses me as I did not really consider the metric space in my solution! Thanks in advance.","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
962219,$K = 0$ and $K = \text{const}$ surfaces produce $k_g = \text{constant}$ intersections?,"Generally speaking, when do constant K (Gauss curvature) and zero K surfaces intersect to produce lines of constant geodesic curvature $ k_g $ ? Small circles on a sphere are examples. Or more specifically the  question is: How should a plane be bent and relatively positioned in order to intersect a constant  K surface along a constant $k_g$ line  ? EDIT1: A more complicated example with a cone type pseudosphere and a geodesic circle: EDIT2: A hyperbolic sphere (with cuspidal edge not shown) cut by an almost flat bent cylinder: In both cases constant $k_g$ geodesic circles are seen rotated around axis of symmetry. EDIT3: MY BACKGROUND CONJECTURE: ""A suitably bent right circular cylinder intersects constant Gauss curvature surfaces in $R^3$ along lines of constant geodesic curvature. It remains to disprove my conjecture and, if validated define what that bending is. EDIT4:
In the particular images above generators of cylinder are perpendicular to symmetry axis  of revolution. EDIT5: I suppose this edit would make it easier to define case of moving red ring:
The ring is made to slide on surface of revolution of K as a special case. Let a thin parallel circle of ring be mounted on the surface. Let us imagine it is made of an inextensible but flexible material.It can be cut and dislocated to any arbitrary latitude,cut ends repaired to be again glued back elsewhere on the surface.

962281,Chebyshev's Theorem regarding real polynomials: Why do only the Chebyshev polynomials achieve equality in this inequality?,In the book Proofs from The Book by Aigner and Ziegler there is a proof of 'Chebyshev's Theorem' which states that if $p(x)$ is a real polynomial of degree n with leading coefficient $1$ then $$ \max_{-1 \leq x \leq 1} |p(x)| \geq \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$$ In the proof $g( \theta ) = p( \cos \theta )$ is written as a cosine polynomial $ \sum_{k=0}^n \lambda_k \cos(k \theta)$ and it is then proved that this can't be less than $|\lambda_n|$ (which happens to be $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$) everywhere. Afterwards it is claimed that 'The reader can easily complete the analysis' to show that the Chebyshev polynomials are the only ones for which equality occurs in the above inequality. I haven't been able to figure this out. Can someone explain why this is true?

962314,Can it be proved that a Meromorphic function only has a countable number of poles?,"One definition I have seen is that a Meromorphic function has at most a countable number of poles. Another says that a function f is Meromorphic if every point is either a pole or the function is analytic there. Now first an easy question, but I am unsure of it: 1. That poles are isolated, that is usually taken as a definition of the pole? Now come the hard question: 2. Can it be proved that if we use definition 2 of a Meromorphic function it can at most have a coutnable number of poles? If the answer to question 1 is yes, I guess we can assume for contradiction that it has more than a countable number of poles, and then show that it must have a limit point, and hence not be isolated? Is this hard to prove? PS: I think an equivalent question for 2 in terms of $\mathbb{R}^2$ is that lets say that the set A is bigger than just beeing countable(I don't know if this implies if it is uncountable?). Then the set A must have a sequence of distinct points, with a limit point in $\mathbb{R}^2$. But I don't think the limit point must be in A? Is this something we can prove?",['complex-analysis']

962354,Pushforward along an exponential map,"My differential geometry is a bit rusty, so I'd like some help with what follows: I have the following setting: $M,N$ Riemannian manifold of dimension $m<n$ with codimension $d$, $M$ in embedded in $N$ via an isometry $\phi$. We define a new manifold $\mathcal{T}=M\times B^d\ni(p,x)$ and a map:
$$\begin{array}{rclc}\overline\phi:&\mathcal{T}&\longrightarrow&N\\&(p,x)&\longmapsto&\exp_{\phi(p)}x\end{array}$$
Assume this new map is again an embedding. Take a vector:
$$v=(v_M,v_B)\in T_{(p,x)}\mathcal{T}\cong T_pM\times T_xB^d$$
I would like to know what is:
$$\overline\phi_*v\in TN$$
We are taking the pushforward of an exponential map, so intuitively I would say that it is just the parallel transport of $\overline\phi_*v$, where $v$ is now seen as an element of $T_{(p,0)}\mathcal{T}$, along the geodesic $\gamma(t)=\exp_{\phi(p)}(tx)$. Is this correct? If it is, what would be the easiest way to prove it? If not so, is there a nice expression/interpretation for it? Edit: Some details on the definition of $\overline\phi$. As written above, the map doesn't really make sense, because $\exp_{\phi(p)}$ should take an element of $T_\phi(p)N$ as argument, while $x\in B^d$ (thanks Jack Lee). However, assuming $M$ is orientable, we have a natural identification of $\mathcal{T}$ as a submanifold of $NM$ (the normal bundle to $M$ in $N$; fix a basis of $NM$...), in particular we can see $(p,x)$ as an element of $N_{\phi(p)}M\subset T_{\phi(p)}M$.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
