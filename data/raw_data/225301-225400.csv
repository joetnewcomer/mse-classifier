4644266,Arithmetic properties of cardinality of unions,"Given that the cardinality of a countable set $A$ equal $\mathfrak a$ , and $A$ be partitioned into singleton with elements within. Can we define the cardinality of disjoint double union with index $i\in I$ and $j\in J$ , $I, J\subset \Bbb N$ such that: $$A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{|I|}\bigcup_{j=1}^{|J|}\{a_{ij}\}$$ $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^{|I|}\bigcup_{j=1}^{|J|}\{a_{ij}\} \right|=\sum_{i=1}^{|I|}\sum_{j=1}^{|J|}|\{a_{ij}\}|=\sum_{i=1}^{|I|}\sum_{j=1}^{|J|}1 $$ $$=|I||J|=\mathfrak a\text{ is true?}$$ And if so, can it serve as an alternate definition of same cardinality between sets as existing a bijection? EDIT: The answer provided by @Hamdiken was satisfactory. Just to add the context of my motivation: I thought of a prove that $|\{2k:k\in\Bbb N\}|=|\{2k-1:k\in\Bbb N\}|=|\Bbb N|$ like: $$|\{2k:k\in\Bbb N\}|=\left|\lim_{n\to\infty}\bigcup_{k=1}^n\{2k\} \right| $$ $$=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\bigcup_{k=1}^n\{2k\} \right|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n|\{2k\}| $$ $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n 1=\lim_{n\to\infty}n=|\Bbb N|  $$ The same can be done for $\{2k-1:k\in\Bbb N\}$ . So given that for that case works, then I tried to prove with the same method that $|\Bbb Z|=|\Bbb N|$ , so i tried to define $\Bbb Z=\{k:k\in \Bbb N \}\cup\{-k:k\in \Bbb N\}\cup\{0\}$ , so: $$|\Bbb Z|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\{0\}\cup\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^2\bigcup_{k=1}^n\{(-1)^ik\}\right) \right| $$ $$=\lim_{n\to\infty} 1+\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^2\bigcup_{k=1}^n\{(-1)^ik\} \right|=1+\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^2\sum_{k=1}^n|\{(-1)^ik\}| $$ $$=1+\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^2\sum_{k=1}^n 1=1+\lim_{n\to\infty}2n $$ $$1+2|\Bbb N| $$ and by the info in this page , $1+2|\Bbb N|=|\Bbb N| $ , and then this method would also work for $|\Bbb Q|=|\Bbb N|$ . Sadly, doesn't for for all cardinality so I don't think it serve as a proof.","['elementary-set-theory', 'cardinals']"
4644319,"Given a function $F$, how to evaluate $\max_{t\in (0,1)}\left\vert \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(ty)\right\vert$?","As an ""extra problem"" for my calculus 2 test class we got the following. Since it is an extra problem, I expected it to be more difficult than the other exercises, but actually but not that much. This is the problem: Let $F:\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $$F:(x_1, x_2, x_3)\mapsto -\frac{1}{|x|^2} +\frac{1}{|x|}\in\mathbb{R}.$$ For a fixed $y\in\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{0\}$ , find $$\max_{t\in (0,1)}\left\vert \frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(ty)\right\vert.$$ To start I computed $\nabla F(x)$ which is $$\nabla F(x) = \left(\frac{2}{|x|^4}-\frac{1}{|x|^3}\right) x,$$ where $x$ denotes the vector $x=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ . I went ahead by computing the second partial derivatives. I had $$\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial x_i^2} = \frac{2}{|x|^4}-\frac{1}{|x|^3} +\frac{3x_i^2}{|x|^5}-\frac{8x_i^2}{|x|^6}, \quad i\in\{1, 2, 3\}$$ and $$\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial x_i\partial x_j} = \frac{3x_i x_j}{|x|^5}-\frac{8x_i x_j}{|x|^6}, \quad i\in\{1, 2, 3\}, i\neq j.$$ I got stuck at this point since I have no idea how to establish the maximum. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it unsuccessfully for a couple of days, but I am really interested in the solution. Could someone please help in finding that maximum? Any hint will be very helpful.

4644350,Consistent or inconsistent estimator,"If $\hat{\theta}_n$ is an estimator for the parameter $\theta$ , then the two sufficient conditions to ensure consistency of $\hat{\theta}_n$ are: Bias( $\hat{\theta}_n)\to 0$ and Var $(\hat{\theta}_n)\to 0$ , then we will have $\lim_{n\to\infty}Pr(|\hat{\theta}_n-\theta|>\varepsilon)=0, \forall\varepsilon>0$ . Now suppose $X_1,\ldots X_n$ be iid samples drawn from the Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$ . Let $\hat{p}=\bar{X}$ be the estimator for $p$ , where $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean. It is clear that $Bias(\hat p)=E(\hat{p})-p=0$ and $Var(\hat{p})=\frac{Var(X_1)}{n}\to 0$ , as $n\to\infty$ . We should expect that $\hat{p}$ is a consistent estimator. However, from the definition of consistency, if I choose $\varepsilon=0.25, p=0.5$ and $X_i=1$ for all i. Then $\hat{p}= 1$ and $$Pr(|\hat{p}-p|>\varepsilon) = Pr(1-0.5>0.25) = 1.$$ This looks like a contradiction to the sufficient conditions above. Can anyone let me know about the mistakes in my argument? Thank you!","['statistics', 'probability-limit-theorems', 'parameter-estimation', 'probability']"
4644357,Monte Carlo Integration by sampling according to general measure,"Is the following statement true: Let $f: C \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a bounded function, where $C \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ compact. Let $\mu$ be a probability measure over $C$ . Furthermore, let $(X_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with $X_n \sim \mu$ . Then $\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(X_n) = \mathbb{E}_{\mu}[f]= \int_C f d \mu$ almost surely. Proof:
Define $Y_n := f(X_n)$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . As $f$ is bounded, $Y_n$ is a bounded random variable. By Popoviciu's inequality on variances , $Var(Y_n) = \sigma^2 < \infty$ . Therefore, the law of large numbers applies and the statement follows. I am hesitant because there are hardly any restrictions on $\mu$ . The compactness of $C$ rules out things like a Cauchy distribution. I am thankful for any pointers and sources on this.","['measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"
4644390,Simple proof involving functional equations,"I'm struggling with a proof involving a simple functional equation.  The problem asks to show that if $f$ satisfies ( for all $x,y$ real): $$f(xy+x+y) = f(xy)+f(x)+f(y),$$ then $f$ must also satisfy $$f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y).$$ I tried contrapositive.  Suppose there is one pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the functional equation, but for which the second equation is not satisfied.  Then, it follows that $$f(xy+x+y) \ne f(xy)+f(x+y).$$ That is, if $(x,y)$ does not hold for the second equation, then neither does $(xy,x+y)$ .  This gives us a collection of points that, if the functional equation is true, also do not hold for second equation.  My goal was to show that the second equation would fail at all points and thus give a contradiction (because both equations are clearly satisfied if $x = 0$ , $y = 0$ , for example), but not sure if this is the right approach. I'm new to study of functional equations, so bear with me.","['functions', 'functional-equations', 'abstract-algebra', 'functional-analysis']"

I am getting a result I am not supposed to get , which means there must be a computation mistake but I really need help finding it . To answer this post, all you need to do is to follow through my calculation and find out the first mistake you see. (Update: the LaTeX newcommand issue and the font issue has been completely resolved.) Fix positive integer $d$ and real number $\theta$ . Define function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ by setting, for every $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_d)$ : \begin{equation*}
f(x) = C \exp \curly{- \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-\theta)^4}
\end{equation*} Here $C$ is a constant such that $f$ becomes a probability density function with respect to the Lebesgue measure. The integral calculator shows that: \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} \exp(-x^4)\, dx = \frac{1}{2} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^3\exp(-x^4)\,dx = 0
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^2\exp(-x^4)\,dx = \frac{1}{2} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^4\exp(-x^4)\, dx = \frac{1}{8} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\int_{\mathbb{R}} x^6\exp(-x^4)\, dx = \frac{3}{8} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}
\end{equation*} Therefore, $C = \bracket{\frac{1}{2} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-d}$ . Next, define: \begin{equation*}
l_{\theta}(x) = \ln (C) - \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-\theta)^4 
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\dot{l_{\theta}}(x) = 4 \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-\theta)^3
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
\ddot{l_{\theta}}(x) = - 12 \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i - \theta)^2
\end{equation*} And we define the matrix: \begin{equation*}
    M_{\theta} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}}^2} & \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}}\ddot{l_{\theta}}} \\
        \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}}\ddot{l_{\theta}}} & \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\ddot{l_{\theta}}^2} - \iota_{\theta}^2 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*} Here $\iota_{\theta} = \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}}^2}$ .
Finally, the statistical curvature $\gamma_{\theta}$ is defined as: \begin{equation*}
    \gamma_{\theta} = \sqrt{\frac{\det{M_{\theta}}}{\iota_{\theta}^3}} =
    \sqrt{\frac{\mathbb{E}_{\theta}\squared{\ddot{l_{\theta}}^2}}{\iota_{\theta}^2} 
    - \frac{\mathbb{E}_{\theta}^2\squared{\dot{l_{\theta}} \ddot{l_{\theta}}}}{\iota_{\theta}^3}- 1}
\end{equation*} Our goal is to compute the curvature for this $f$ .
We will be repeatedly using the formula: \begin{equation*}
\bracket{\sum_{i=1}^da_i}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^da_i^2 + 2\sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_ia_j
\end{equation*} We have: \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    & \iota_{\theta} = \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}}^2} 
    = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \bracket{4 \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-\theta)^3}^2 C \exp{- \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-\theta)^4} dx
    \\ & = 16 C \curly{\sum_{i=1}^d \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} x_i^6 \exp{- \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^4}  dx +
    2 \sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} x_i^3x_j^3 \exp{- \sum_{i=1}^d x_i^4}  dx }
    \\ & = 16 C d \bracket{\frac{1}{2} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{d-1} \frac{3}{8} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}
    = 12d \bracket{\Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-1}\Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}
    \end{split}
\end{equation*} Clearly, $\mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\dot{l_{\theta}} \ddot{l_{\theta}} } = 0$ . Finally: \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        & \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\ddot{l_{\theta}}^2} =
        \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{ \curly{- 12 \sum_{i=1}^d (x_i - \theta)^2 }^2 }
        \\ & = 144C \curly{\sum_{i=1}^d \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} x_i^4 \exp{-\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^4} dx 
        + 2\sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} x_i^2x_j^2 \exp{-\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^4} dx}
        \\ & = 144C \curly{d \bracket{\frac{1}{2} \Gamma\bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{d-1} \frac{1}{8} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}} +
        d(d-1) \bracket{\frac{1}{2} \Gamma\bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{d-2} \bracket{\frac{1}{2} \Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}^2}
        \\ & = 36d + 144d(d-1) \bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-2}\bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}^{2}
    \end{split}
\end{equation*} We see that the last entry is: \begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}_{\theta} \squared{\ddot{l_{\theta}}^2} - \iota_{\theta}^2  
    = 36d - 144d \bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-2}\bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}^{2}
\end{equation*} Now we have a problem. The covariance matrix $M_{\theta}$ is positive-semidefinite.
The statistical curvature should be a real number.
However, my computation shows that this is not the case for $f$ . \begin{equation*}
    M_{\theta} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        12d \bracket{\Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-1}\Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}} & 0 \\
        0 &  36d - 144d \bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^{-2}\bracket{\Gamma\bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}^{2}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
    \gamma_{\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{\bracket{\Gamma \bracket{\frac{1}{4}}}^2 - 4 \bracket{\Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}^2}}
    {2 \Gamma \bracket{\frac{3}{4}}}

4644511,Minimizing a function in $\mathbb R^3.$,"I am currently solving the following task: Exercise. Minimize in $\mathbb R^3$ the function $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 - x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 - x_1x_3.$ My attempt. I was able to show that $(0,0,0)$ is a local  strict minimizer (consequently, $f(0,0,0) = 0$ is a local strict minimum) using the usual arguments, i.e., I found the critical points of $f$ (which is only one, $(0,0,0)$ ); then, I found the hessian of $f$ in the point $(0,0,0)$ and proved it was positive defined. Therefore, from the theorem below I am able to guarantee that $(0,0,0)$ is a local strict minimizer. Theorem. Assume that $f$ is twice differentiable in $\bar x \in X.$ Then, if $\nabla f(\bar x) = 0$ and $H(\bar x) = \nabla ^2 f(\bar x)$ is positive defined, then $\bar x$ is a local strict minimizer. My question. After this, one question comes up to my mind: is $(0,0,0)$ a global minimizer? Looking to answer this further question, I gave some values to some of the coordinates ( $x_1, x_2 $ or $x_3$ ) individually and plotted the resultant graphs (which are $3D$ ). Every one I plotted (and I plotted a nice quantity...) leads me to the same conclusion: $(0,0,0)$ is, in fact, a global minimizer. After this, I tried to prove analitically that $f(x_1,x_2,x_3) \geqslant 0,$ for every $(x_1,x_2,x_3) \in \mathbb R^3$ (to show that, in fact $(0,0,0)$ is a global minimizer).

4644513,"How to procedurally generate deterministic, easily differentiable terrain?","For my A-Level computer science project I'm making an arcade game in which I need to generate a heightmap for 3D terrain.
Originally I tried using a sum of sine curves (with randomly initialised x and y scale factors) as I need it to be easily differentiable (players are modelled as spheres rolling along the terrain so I need to know the gradient to calculate the portion of weight acting down the slope) but this doesn't provide a high enough periodicity or level of detail.
So without a very high number of sine curves to sum (which is very computationally expensive) this doesn't seem to really work.
Using a high degree polynomial is also difficult as the terrain should maintain roughly the same average height as the game progresses.
I need to be able to initialise an equation for the curve at the start of the game and then base all calculations on that since terrain generation should be deterministic (unloading then reloading the same chunk should generate same terrain without having to store it in memory) so I don't think I can just use Perlin Noise unfortunately.

For example, $\{6,7,15\}$ is an antichain but not a maximal antichain, and $\{1\}$ is a maximal antichain, and $\{p : p \text{ is a prime less than } 120 \}$ is a maximal antichain. Here is my work so far: whatever we end up doing with primes, we must add one to our final result because $\{1\}$ is a special antichain. Since there are precisely $30$ primes less than $120$ , I was at first thinking about the number of ways of putting $30$ primes into $k$ indistinct boxes, so that for example if $2, 5, 7$ were in the same box, then we would have their product $70$ in the resulting set. We can form maximal antichains this way; however, this is not the only way to form maximal antichains, since $18,20$ could be part of some maximal antichains.

There are $17$ primes from $2$ to $59$ , including the two ends; there are $26$ primes from $11$ to $113$ , including both ends. This question comes from a chapter dealing with Sperner's theorem.

4644751,Do the lifts of commuting circle homeomorphisms commute?,"I am going over proofs of the following result concerning the rotation number of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle: If $f, g \in \text{Homeo}^+(S^1)$ commute with respect to composition (i.e. $f\circ g = g\circ f$ ), then $\rho(f\circ g) = \rho(f) + \rho(g)$ where $\rho(f) \in S^1$ is the rotation number. The Problem: From what I've seen on this site (e.g., here ), the proof involves lifting $f$ and $g$ to maps $F$ and $G$ on $\mathbb{R}$ , and then utilizing $F\circ G = G\circ F$ . But I'm having trouble seeing why the lifts must commute. My work so far: Certainly it is clear from $f\circ g = g\circ f$ that the lifts satisfy $\pi\circ(F\circ G) = \pi\circ(G\circ F)$ , where $\pi : \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ is the canonical covering map. Therefore the map $F\circ G - G\circ F$ maps $\mathbb{R}$ into $\mathbb{Z}$ . So by continuity of the lifts, there is a constant $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $F\circ G = G \circ F + k$ . Thus the problem reduces to showing $k = 0$ . I can at least prove that $k \in \{-1,0,1\}$ by the following method: let $F$ and $G$ be the lifts such that $F(0),G(0) \in [0,1)$ . Then $F(G(0)) \in [F(0), F(0)+1) \subseteq [0,2)$ and $G(F(0)) \in [G(0), G(0)+1) \subseteq [0,2)$ . Immediately it follows that $|k| = |F(G(0)) - G(F(0))| < 2$ . However, I can't seem to proceed from here. It should be noted that it doesn't matter which lifts of $f$ and $g$ we pick, because if $F_1, F_2$ lift $f$ and $G_1, G_2$ lift $g$ , then there exist constants $p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $F_1 = F_2 + p$ and $G_1 = G_2 + q$ . It follows that $$
F_1 \circ G_1 = F_1 \circ (G_2 + q) = (F_1 \circ G_2) + q = [(F_2 + p)\circ G_2] + q = F_2 \circ G_2 + p + q
$$ and $$
G_1 \circ F_1 = G_1 \circ (F_2 + p) = (G_1 \circ F_2) + p = [(G_2 + q)\circ F_2] + p = G_2 \circ F_2 + p + q
$$ hence $F_1\circ G_1 = G_1 \circ F_1$ if and only if $F_2 \circ G_2 = G_2 \circ F_2$ . It should also be noted that it is absolutely necessary (at least for the linked proof) that $k = 0$ , because otherwise $F\circ G = G\circ F + k$ implies that $(F\circ G)^n = F^n\circ G^n$ plus some quadratic function of $n$ (I believe it's $k$ times the $n$ th triangular number, but I've not worked the details). The quadratic does not get eliminated once we take the rotation number limit in this case.","['general-topology', 'function-and-relation-composition', 'dynamical-systems']"

I want to find those coordinates without the presuming that the foci exists because most proofs I found online assume the properties of foci to be true and then take some extreme case to find foci's coordinates. So to rephrase my question: Given a closed curve of the equation $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} =1$$ prove that there exists two points inside the curve such that if we take any point on the boundary of the curve and join it to those two points then the sum of those lengths will give a fixed constant based on $a$ and $b$ (Assume $a>b$ ). Here's my attempt which gave me nothing: Let's take a point $P$ on the curve as $\left(x,\  b\sqrt{1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}}\right)$ Let those two points be $(-f,0)$ and $(f,0)$ then the sum of lengths from point $P$ becomes $$S = \sqrt{(f+x)^2+b^2\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)}+\sqrt{(f-x)^2+b^2\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)}$$ Differentiating this wrt to $f$ and equating to $0$ to find the stationary case $$\dfrac{f+x}{\sqrt{\left(f+x\right)^2+b^2\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)}}+\dfrac{f-x}{\sqrt{\left(f-x\right)^2+b^2\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)}}=0$$ Squaring and simplifying $$4bfx\left(1-\frac{x^2}{a^2}\right)=0 \implies f =0$$ which is obviously wrong...

4644833,Does convexity on a set implies hessian PSD on the boundary?,"Let $C \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ be a closed convex set with nonempty interior.
Let $f : \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ be twice differentiable on $C$ . We also assume that it is convex on $C$ : $$ (\forall x,y \in C) (\forall \alpha \in [0,1]) \quad f((1- \alpha)x + \alpha y) \leq (1- \alpha)f(x) + \alpha f(y).$$ My main question is : can we say that the Hessian of $f$ is positive semidefinite on $C$ ? Some comments: The basic result I know holds when $C$ is an open set ; so applying such result on the interior of $C$ , we immediately get that for all $x \in {\rm{int}}~C$ , $\nabla^2 f(x) \succeq 0$ . So my question is about what happens at the boundary. What is also clear is that if I assume further that $f$ is of class $C^2$ on $C$ (and not only twice differentiable), we could pass to the limit from the interior to the boundary of $C$ to conclude that yes, $\nabla^2 f(x) \succeq 0$ for all $x \in C$ . I have been trying to find a counterexample, but every example of ""twice differentiable but not $C^2$ "" function I find is highly nonconvex, so I start to wonder if convexity and twice differentiable implies $C^2$ ? After all, it is known that: convex functions are always continuous in the interior of their domain the subdifferential of a convex function has a closed graph ; so differentiable convex functions have a continuous gradient So my secondary question is : is the hessian of a twice differentiable convex function always continous?","['continuity', 'convex-analysis', 'derivatives', 'hessian-matrix']"

Prove that $\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}f(x)\sin{x}dx \geq \pi - 2$ . The given inequality does not seem very generous, so what I tried to do, seeing that we need to obtain $\sin{x}$ and we have a $\tan{x}$ inside the inequality, was to process it by rearranging terms and eventually obtaining $f(x)\sin{x}$ on one side. Therefore: $(f^{''}(x) - f(x))\tan{x} \geq 1 - 2f^{'}(x) \Leftrightarrow (f^{''}(x) - f(x))\frac{\sin{x}}{\cos{x}} \geq 1 - 2f^{'}(x)$ At this stage, since we only really care about $I = (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}) \subset \mathbb{R}$ , we know that $\cos{x} > 0, \forall x \in I$ , but $\sin{x}$ takes both negative, positive and a null value, therefore we cannot multiply by it. We can, however, multiply by $cos{x}$ , unaffecting our inequality. We obtain: $(f^{''}(x) - f(x))\sin{x} \geq (1 - 2f^{'}(x))\cos{x} \Leftrightarrow f^{''}(x)\sin{x} - f(x)\sin{x} \geq \cos{x} - 2f^{'}(x)\cos{x}$ By rearranging and isolating the $f(x)\sin{x}$ terms, we finally obtain that: $f(x)\sin{x} \leq 2f^{'}(x)\cos{x} + f^{''}(x)\sin{x} - \cos{x}, \forall x \in I$ The problem with this inequality is that we have a $\leq$ , but we need a $\geq$ . Knowing this is true for all $x \in I$ , it must also remain true for every $-x \in I$ , therefore we map $x \rightarrow -x$ in our inequality, to obtain: $-f(-x)\sin{x} \leq 2f^{'}(-x)\cos{x} - f^{''}(-x)\sin{x} - \cos{x}$ Denote $J = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}f(x)\sin{x}dx$ . It is known that $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = \int_{a}^{b}f(a+b-x)dx$ . Therefore, substituting $u = -x$ in J, we obtain that $J = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}f(-x)\sin{(-x)}dx = -\int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}f(-x)\sin{x}dx$ , since sine is an odd function. However, this is where I am lost; I do not exactly know how to turn the sign from $\leq$ to $\geq$ , even with my substitution idea. Another thing I noticed is that the $f^{'}(x)\cos{x} + f^{''}(x)\sin{x}$ term can be written as $(f^{'}(x)\sin{x})^{'}$ , but the constant term $2$ is particularly annoying.

Lobachevsky's integral formula states that if $f(x)$ is a continous $\pi$ - periodic function then we have that $$ \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(x)}{x}f(x) dx= \int_0^{\pi/2} f(x) dx.$$ Substituing our $f(x)$ yields us $$ \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{1+\cos(x)}{2+\cos(x)} dx = \pi/2 - \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{1}{2+\cos(x)}dx $$ where $$I_2 = \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{1}{2+\cos(x)}dx = \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\sec^2(x/2)}{3+\tan^2(x/2)}dx.$$ Letting $ u = \tan(x/2)/\sqrt{3}$ , for which $du = \sec^2(x/2)/(2\sqrt{3})dx$ , therefore gives us: $$ I_2 = \int_0^{1/\sqrt{3}}\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3u^2+3} = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}.$$ Finally we can compute $I$ to $$I = 2\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{\pi(3\sqrt{3}-2)}{3\sqrt{3}}.$$ I've tried calculating this integral in Desmos where it gives me $0$ when I calculate the integrand on the interval $(-\infty, \infty)$ , and something negative for $(0,\infty)$ . This contradicts my answer. I also tried typing it into Wolfram, without success. Can anyone confirm the validity of my result?","['integration', 'improper-integrals', 'real-analysis']"
4645256,Show that $G$ is a subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}_3(\mathbb R)$ and $G \cong \mathbb R^2 \rtimes (\mathbb R^\times \times \mathbb R^\times)$,"This is exercise $3-5$ from Milne's group theory book. $\DeclareMathOperator{\GL}{GL}$ $\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb R}$ Problem. Let $G$ be all matrices in $\GL_3 (\R)$ of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & b\\ 0 & a & c \\ 0 & 0 & d \\ \end{pmatrix},$$ where $ad\neq 0$ . Check that $G$ is a subgroup of $\GL_3 (\R)$ and that it is a semidirect product of $\R^2$ (additive group) and $\R^\times \times \R^\times$ . Is it a direct product of these two groups? Attempt. First, to check $G$ is a subgroup of $\GL_3 (\R)$ we can take a matrix $A \in G$ and find that its inverse is given by $$A^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} a^{-1} & 0 & e\\ 0 & a^{-1} & f \\ 0 & 0 & d^{-1}\end{pmatrix},$$ where $e=-a^{-1}bd^{-1}$ and $f= -a^{-1}cd^{-1}$ . Then straightforward matrix multiplication shows if $A,B \in G$ then $AB^{-1}\in G$ , so by the subgroup test $G$ is a subgroup. Now to show $G  \cong \R^2 \rtimes (\R^\times \times \R^\times)$ it suffices to find $N \cong \R^2$ and $Q \cong \R^\times \times \R^\times$ such that \begin{align*}
    N &\vartriangleleft G;\\
    NQ &= G;\\
    N \cap Q &= \{1\}.\\
\end{align*} Let $N$ be all matrices of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & d \end{pmatrix}$$ such that $ad \neq 0$ , and let $Q$ be all matrices of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & b \\ 0 & 1 & c \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{pmatrix},$$ such that $b,c \in \R^\times$ . Then we can identify $N$ with $\R^2$ and $Q$ with $\R^\times \times \R^\times$ in the obvious way, and we see that the three conditions for semidirect product are also satisfied. Therefore $G \cong \R^2 \rtimes (\R^\times \times \R^\times)$ as desired. Note that $G$ cannot be a direct product of these two subgroups because, e.g., $Q$ is not normal in $G$ .

4645299,Differentiating between points and their coordinates,"In Croatian mathematical textbooks it is customary to use the notation $A(x,y)$ to mean that $(x,y)$ are the coordinates of point $A$ . The coordinates of the point are clearly differentiated from the point itself. However, I have never encountered this notation in foreign (English) literature. Rather, Iâ€™ve seen this written as $A=(x,y)$ . This confuses me because if interpreted literally the notation says that point $A$ is the ordered pair of coordinates $(x,y)$ with no differentiation made between the two whatsoever. Is this notation shorthand or are points and ordered pairs of real numbers indistinguishable in this paradigm? I get that it makes no difference in practice since every n-dimensional Euclidean space is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ but Iâ€™m still curious as to the precise meaning of this notation.

Showing $C(x)\subseteq [x]$ is easy: let $y\in C(x)$ and let $f\colon X\to E^1$ be continuous with $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=1$ . Since $C(x)$ is connected, $f\big(C(x)\big)$ is connected and thus $[0,1]=[f(x),f(y)]\subseteq f(C(x))$ . It is then clear that $C(x)\subseteq [x]$ .

4645410,"If infinitely many equidistant points on a circle are connected in every possible way, will there be a line that crosses the center of the circle?","I've been thinking about the fact that if an odd number of points are placed on a circle equidistantly (same arc length between points) and these points are connected in every possible way, there will not be any line that cross the center of the circle, no matter how many points there are if this number of points is odd. Only if there are an even number of points there can be lines connecting points that cross the center of the circle. But what about when there are infinite points? One can think that if we divide a circle into infinitely equidistant points and connect these points in every possible way, all the internal points of the circle will be crossed by some line, but this is not true given that only an even number of points are able of generate a line that crosses the center of the circle. My question is: is ""infinity"" even or odd? If someone were to divide the circle forever and connect the points in every possible way, in the end would the center be crossed or not? EDIT:
In cartesian coordinates, points on a unitary circle are given by: $$P =\left(cos\left(\theta\right),sin\left(\theta\right)\right) $$ Since the circle has been divided into N pieces, the angle between each point is: $$\theta = \frac{2\pi}{N}$$ If you say some point A has angle $\phi = \frac{n2\pi}{N}$ where n can be any number from zero to N-1, and point B has angle $\gamma = \frac{\left(n+k\right)2\pi}{N}$ where k can be any number from one to N-1, you end up with the condition: $$k = \left(2p+\frac{1}{2}\right)N$$ For the line between the points A and B to be equal to the diameter of the circle. if k and N are integers, then it means N needs to be even.

I do not want to use any non-set elements. However, in that case, there's a limited number of possible sets with less than depth $M$ , while there's an unlimited number of possible tuples.

Prove the relation $$a \sim b \iff f(a) = f(b)$$ is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the fibres of $f$ . In principle this is easy to solve. Reflexivity, Symmetry and Transitivity are all straightforward since $f(a) = f(a)$ $f(a) = f(b) \iff f(b) = f(a)$ $f(a) = f(b) \wedge f(b) = f(c) \rightarrow f(a) = f(c)$ Any fibre of $f$ is $\{a\in A|f(a) = b\}$ and since the right inverse $h$ exists, $b$ can be written as $f(c)$ . $f(a) = f(c) \iff a\sim b$ . Simple enough? Except this all sounded a little too straightforward and I couldn't really understand in particular how the equivalence classes are the same as the fibres of $f$ . So I thought up this lil visual representation. All the elements of $B$ are occupied i.e. the codomain is the range. Sometimes multiple elements of $A$ point towards a single element of $B$ . That is allowed by our required surjectivity. Now every time $f(x) = f(y)$ for two elements $x,y \in A$ , $x \sim y$ . $x$ and $y$ share an equivalence class by this definition. I feel this captures the intrinsic symmetry of equivalence classes well. $x$ and $y$ are ""equivalent"" in that there is a certain indistinguishability about them. They are identical in the one way we care about, that applying $f$ to either yields the same result. Within that little coloured bubble inside $A$ , they are all the same. I think this best shows how the equivalence classes are the fibres of $f$ . P.S. you can also see how all the equivalence classes form a partition of $A$ . Am I correct in everything above? In particular, I still do not understand why $f$ must be surjective because while it was an integral part of the proof, I could always add a few extra harmless elements to $B$ , invalidating the surjective property of $f$ , and the equivalence classes would remain the fibres of $f$ .","['elementary-set-theory', 'equivalence-relations']"

So what I inferred initially is that modulus function are continuous but non differentiable at the point where $f(x)=0$ (where $f(x)=|x|$ ofc) as the left hand derivative and the right hand derivatives are different. But then I know if $f(x)$ = $|x^3|$ at $x=0$ the left and the right hand derivative would be defined and equal, thus being defined for all x belonging to Real numbers.

4645732,What's the explanation for the distribution of this kind of dice roll?,"Consider the following type of dice roll for the attack damage in some tabletop RPG: Roll three six-sided dice. Pick two of them that have a sum greater six. The remaining die is the attack damage. If no combination of two dice has a sum greater than six then the attack damage is zero. Naturally players want to maximize damage and thus pick the lowest possible sum of two dice that is still greater than six. I tried to simulate that roll to see the probability distribution of the attack damage and was surprised that there is a probability of ~20% to roll the maximum damage of six. Here is the full distribution after 1M rolls: dmg p 0 0.195335 1 0.153332 2 0.097448 3 0.125001 4 0.101249 5 0.115615 6 0.21202 I makes sense to me that the attack damage is biased towards higher values, because players will choose the higher one when having the choice, but I kind of expected the distribution to increase from 1 to 6 as a result of that instead of fluctuating so much. So what's happening here? Inspired by some of the comments I plotted the distribution with this roll/selection for different kind of dice: The target value is always the most probable value when rolling two dice and taking the sum (so 7 for d6, 11 for d10 and 21 for d20).","['statistics', 'probability-distributions', 'dice', 'probability']"

However, if we consider some field extension $K/F,$ is $\text{rad} (f)=\text{rad} (g)$ possible in $K[x]?$ I am taking $f,g$ to be irreducible in $F[x].$ If $f,g$ are irreducible in a characteristic $0$ field, then $f,g$ won't have repeated factors in $K,$ and so $\text{rad} (f)=\text{rad} (g)$ won't be possible.

4646060,Is this a new discovery in the diagonals of Pascal's triangle?,"To preface, I am a senior in high school and my knowledge of combinatorics and its notation is quite limited. I came across Pascal's triangle while drilling the binomial expansions into my head, and I quickly became fascinated with its various properties. When I looked at the diagonals, I wanted to challenge myself by coming up with formulae for the diagonals, and I began with the first two diagonals. Once again, I am not familiar with the standard notation, so please look past it for now. However, I would greatly appreciate advice on what I should change, and where I can learn the standard notation. I am making this post off of a ""paper"" I wrote to collect my thoughts, screenshots of said paper will be used. For the diagonals, I will use $D_n$ , where each value of $n$ represents each diagonal. (ex: $D_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\cdots]$ For the numbers within the sets of $D_n$ , I will use $d_n$ . $D_n = [d_1, d_2, d_3\cdots]$ So for the first two diagonals $D_1: d_n=1$ $D_2: d_n=x$ As I approached the third diagonal, my mind immediately jumped to recursion, and the formula for $D_n$ would be $D_3: d_n=  d_{n-1} + x$ ; $d_{n<1} = 0$ (this applies for all subsequent formulae) The formula for $D_4$ took me a little longer, but I knew the set for $D_4$ was larger than $D_3$ , so its formula should contain the formula from $D_3$ and another positive term. After some messing around, I arrived at making the next term as follows. $D_4: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + (d_{n-1} - d_{n-2})$ The next day, I continued my brainstorming and made the next 2 formulae. $D_5: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + 2(d_{n-1} - d_{n-2}) - (d_{n-2} - d_{n-3})$ $D_6: d_n= d_{n-1} + x + 3(d_{n-1} - d_{n-2}) - 3(d_{n-2} - d_{n-3})+(d_{n-3} - d_{n-4})$ I hit a brick wall for a little while, and I stared at the formulae I had for hours until I noticed something. I looked at the coefficients of the terms, and saw a pattern forming; the coefficients follow Pascal's triangle. This can be visualized best in the image below, which includes the formulae from $D_3$ through $D_8$ . Apologies for my handwriting The coefficients of the formulae appear to follow the values of Pascal's triangle indefinitely. It is worth noting for sets $D_n$ where $d_2$ is an odd number, the coefficients are always central binomial rows and the last term is always negative. And for sets $D_n$ where $d_2$ is an even number, the coefficients are always central trinomial rows and the last term is always positive. With this in mind, I followed the pattern to make the formula for $D_{11}$ , and then used it to solve $d_{10}$ of $D_{11}$ . again, handwriting So this is where I am at right now, nothing much else besides that except my final questions and some basic proof at the very bottom. Have I found something new? Not the formula's use itself, because I know there are other much more efficient methods, but the pattern that I am seeing in the coefficients. Do other methods for getting a number in a diagonal of Pascal's triangle show the rows of Pascal's triangle like this method is? Regardless of if this is new or not, can I get some help with the notation?

4646084,Unraveling the various definitions of $k$-space or compactly generated space,"There are multiple (incompatible) definitions of ""compactly generated"" or "" $k$ -space"" in the literature.  For a sample, see the various references mentioned in this question .  See also the discussion here and here for example. One starts with a topological space $(X,T)$ , where $T$ is the topology.  Sometimes some separation condition (like weak-Hausdorff, etc) is added to the definition, sometimes not, but we'll ignore that part here.  What all the definitions have in common is that one takes the final topology on $X$ with respect to some family of continuous maps into $X$ .  One can either take all the inclusion maps from certain subspaces, or all the continuous maps from arbitrary spaces of a certain kind.  And on the other hand, one can take the domains of these maps to be compact, or compact Hausdorff.  That gives a total of four combinations.  I am trying to unravel things and understand the relationships between these four possible definitions, spelled out explicitly below. In each case, one starts with an appropriate family $\mathcal F$ of continuous functions into $X$ and one forms the final topology on $X$ with respect to $\mathcal F$ .  That topology is called the k-ification of $(X,T)$ , denoted $T_{\mathcal F}$ .  The space $X$ is then called a $k$ -space or compactly generated if its topology coincides with its k-ification.  So here are the four possibilities with separate names for the purpose of discussion: (1) CGSub: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all inclusions from compact subspaces of $X$ .  The corresponding definition of compactly generated space is the one in wikipedia . (2) CG: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary compact spaces. (3) HCGSub: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all inclusions from compact Hausdorff subspaces of $X$ .  The wikipedia article calls the corresponding spaces ""Hausdorff-compactly generated"". (4) HCG: $\mathcal F=$ the family of all continuous maps from arbitrary compact Hausdorff spaces.  This is the definition in nlab and is the one more commonly used in algebraic topology. Note that for CG and HCG, the families of maps are not sets but proper classes.  The final topology is still perfectly well-defined, as explained here . To understand the relationships between the various k-ifications, the following is useful. Lemma 1: Let $X$ be a set, $\mathcal F$ a family of functions from topological spaces to $X$ , and $\mathcal G$ a subfamily of $\mathcal F$ .  Then the respective final topologies satisfy $T_{\mathcal F}\subseteq T_{\mathcal G}$ . This implies these relationships between the k-ifications: $T_{CG}\subseteq T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}$ $T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}$ Now combine this with Lemma 2: Suppose $(X,T)$ is a topological space and $\mathcal F$ and $\mathcal G$ are two families of continuous functions from topological spaces to $X$ .  If each $f:Y\to X$ in $\mathcal F$ factors through an element $g:Z\to X$ in $\mathcal G$ (via some continuous function $Y\to Z$ ), then $T_{\mathcal G}\subseteq T_{\mathcal F}$ . We can apply this to CG and CGSub.  Each continuous function in CG, namely $f:C\to X$ from a compact space $C$ , has compact image and factors through the inclusion $f(C)\to X$ in CGSub.  So $T_{CGSub}\subseteq T_{CG}$ . Combining this with the previous inclusions gives this relationship between a topology and its k-ifications: $$T\subseteq T_{CGSub}=T_{CG}\subseteq T_{HCG}\subseteq T_{HCGSub}.$$ And for the corresponding definitions of spaces, $X$ is CGSub if $T=T_{CGSub}$ , etc.  So the relationships between the various definitions of space properties are: $$HCGSub\implies HCG\implies CG \iff CGSub.$$ In particular, ""nlab compactly generated"" (HCG) implies ""wikipedia compactly generated"" (CGSub).  And for the wikipedia definition, it does not matter if it is defined via subspaces (CGSub) or via maps from arbitrary spaces (CG). The implication HCG $\implies$ CGSub cannot be reversed.  For example, as explained in this question , the one-point compactification of a space which is not CGSub (like the Arens-Fort space) is CGSub but not HCG (because HCG is preserved by open subspaces, but that's not the case in the example). Also note: if $X$ is Hausdorff, all notions above coincide. Apart from validating the above, I would be interested if anyone could point to a reference that ""nlab definition"" implies ""wikipedia definition"". Specific question: Can the implication HCGSub $\implies$ HCG be reversed?  In general a continuous map from a compact Hausdorff space does not seem to factor through an inclusion of a compact Hausdorff subspace of the codomain.  So my guess would be no.  But what would be an example of a HCG space that is not HCGSub?  A compact example would be even better. Minor question: HCGSub is called ""Hausdorff-compactly generated"" in wikipedia (note the hyphen!).  That name seems very dubious.  Never heard of it anywhere.  Maybe someone can comment on that.  Maybe for categorical reasons HCGSub is not a very useful notion compared with HCG, for uses in algebraic topology in particular?",['general-topology']
4646086,Definition of ground state?,"In quantum mechanics, a ground state is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with the minimal eigenvalue and its existence is guaranteed by appropriate theorems. At least that's how it's defined in undergraduate courses. In the formalism of operator algebras, the definition of ground state is equally clear but so different that I cannot relate it to the classic definition. Given a suitable operator algebra $U$ and a continuous group of automorphisms $\tau$ defineing a dynamical system on $U$ , and calling $\tau$ the infinitesimal generator of the system (for a quantum system this would be the Hamiltonian) a ground state $\omega$ is one that for every operator $A$ of the algebra with adjoint $A*$ satisfies $$- i \omega(A^* \delta(A)) \geq 0 \ \ \ \ \ (1) $$ Eq. (1) follows from the KMS condition, I will paste a screenshot from one source here: I wonder if anybody has an intuition on how to bridge this definition to the classic one.","['c-star-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis', 'quantum-mechanics', 'quantum-information']"
4646124,Proof of Running Maximum of Brownian motion has continuous distribution without using the density or the fact that it is absolutely continuous,"I wanted to show that the running maximum say $\max_{t\in [0,1]}W_{t}$ has continuous distribution without taking help from the fact that it is absolutely continuous and has the distribution of $|W_{1}|$ . To clarify, I want to just use the definition of Brownian motion and to prove this. (I am always talking about the standard brownian motion here). Let us restrict to the set (of probability $1$ ) where $W_{t}$ is continuous. Then I want to show that $P(\{\max_{t\in[0,1]}W_{t}=x\})=0$ for each $x\in\Bbb{R}$ . So let us consider an enumeration of rationals $\{r_{n}\}_{n\in\Bbb{N}}$ in $[0,1]$ and define $Q_{n}=\{r_{1},...,r_{n}\}$ . We have that $\max_{t\in[0,1]}W_{t}=\sup_{r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]}W_{r}$ . Also $\sup_{r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]}W_{r}=x\implies W_{r}\leq x\,,\forall r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ and for each $m\in\Bbb{N}$ , there exists $r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]$ such that $W_{r}\in (x,x-\frac{1}{m}]$ . So I want to write $\displaystyle P(\sup_{r\in[0,1]\cap\Bbb{Q}} W_{r}=x)\leq P\big(\bigcap_{m\in\Bbb{N}}\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb{N}}\{\exists r\in Q_{n}\,: W_{r}\in (x-\frac{1}{m},x]\}\big)=\lim_{m\to\infty}P(\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb{N}}\{\exists r\in Q_{n}: W_{r}\in(x-\frac{1}{m},x])$ $$\leq \lim_{m\to\infty}P\bigg(\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb{N}}\big\{\exists r\in Q_{n}:W_{r}\in (x-\frac{1}{m2^{n}},x]\big\}\bigg)\leq \lim_{m\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}P(W_{r_{k}}\in(x-\frac{1}{m2^{n}},x])$$ $$\leq \lim_{m\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{n}{m2^{n}}=0$$ However I am having trouble making this precise and I obviously am making a mistake in the step of considering $\lim_{m\to\infty}\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n}P(W_{r_{k}}\in(x-\frac{1}{m2^{n}},x])$ . Can anyone tell me how do I make it correct?. Also is there an easier way to do this? (I mean without using the fact that it has a density). Another way I tried to think of is that if I can show that $\max_{t\in[0,1]} W_{t}=\max_{r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]}W_{r}$ (note that I mean $\max$ and not $\sup$ ) , then I can do it easily as for any finitely many points $r_{1},...,r_{n}$ , we have $P(\max_{r\in Q_{n}}W_{r}=x)\leq \sum_{k=1}^{n} P(W_{r_{k}}=x)=0$ for all $n$ . So I can proceed with the countable union and conclude what I want. But this is not necessarily true for continuous functions. I mean for example , $\sin(2x)$ achieves it's maximum at $x=\frac{\pi}{4}\in[0,1]$ and not at a rational point. EDIT: I also tried the following but I am unsure of it. Consider the sets $A_{n}=\bigcap_{m\in\Bbb{N}}\bigg\{\exists r\in Q_{n}:W_{r}\in(x-\frac{1}{m},x]\bigg\}$ . Then $A_{n}$ 's increase to $\bigcap_{m\in\Bbb{N}}\bigg\{\exists r\in \Bbb{Q}\cap[0,1]:W_{r}\in(x-\frac{1}{m},x]\bigg\}$ . But $\displaystyle P(A_{n})=P\bigg(\bigcap_{m\in\Bbb{N}}\bigg\{\bigcup_{r\in Q_{n}}W_{r}\in (x-\frac{1}{m},x]\bigg\}\bigg)=\lim_{m\to\infty}P\bigg(\bigcup_{r\in Q_{n}}\bigg\{W_{r}\in(x-\frac{1}{m},x]\bigg\}\bigg)$ (We could switch the intersection over $m$ to limit because for each fixed $n$ , the sets $\{\exists r\in Q_{n}:W_{r}\in(x-\frac{1}{m},x]\}$ is a decreasing sequence) $$\leq \lim_{m\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{m}\frac{1}{\sqrt{r_{k}}}=0$$ (By using a simple bound for standard gaussian that $P(X\in(a,b))\leq (b-a)$ for $X\sim N(0,1))$ Also to note that the maximum is always $\geq 0$ a.s. . So we can ignore $r=0$ and consider $r\in\Bbb{Q}\cap(0,1]$ as $W_{0}=0$ a.s. So $P(A_{n})=0\,,\forall n\in\Bbb{N}$ and hence $P(\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb{N}}A_{n})=0$ which is what is required.","['probability-distributions', 'solution-verification', 'brownian-motion', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

Suppose there are two different solutions $y_1,y_2$ . We look at $z= y_1 - y_2$ . $z\left(0\right) = z\left(1\right) = 0$ . So by Rolle's theorem $z$ has a positive maximum or a negative minimum. W.L.O.G $z$ has a positive maximum at point $x_0$ .

4646193,$\int_a^b \frac{(x-a)^p(b-x)^{1-p}}{\text{P}(x)} dx$ using contour integration and residue theorem,"So a while ago I came across these types of integrals that has the form of $$
I = \int_a^b (x-a)^p(b-x)^{1-p}dx
$$ Where $a$ , $b$ and $p$ are real numbers, $a<b$ and $0<p<1$ . And those types integral has a closed form, namely $$
I = \frac{\pi}{2}p(1-p)(b-a)^2\csc(p\pi)
$$ But then I also came across integrals like these along the way $$
\int_0^3 \frac{x^{3/4}(3-x)^{1/4}}{5-x}dx
$$ So I asked myself, is there a more generalized form of the $I$ integral, namely $$
J = \int_a^b \frac{(x-a)^p(b-x)^{1-p}}{\text{P}(x)} dx
$$ Where $\text{P}(x)$ is any polynomial. To begin with, I decided to make a more concise (?) definition of the function $$
\text{P}(x) = \prod_{k=1}^n (x-c_k)^{q_k}
$$ Where $c_k$ is the $k$ -th root of $\text{P}(x)$ and $q_k$ is the $k$ -th root's multiplicity. $c_1 \not = c_2 \not = c_3 \not = \ldots \not = c_n$ , $c_k \not \in (a, b)$ , and if $a$ or $b$ is a root of $\text{P}(x)$ then they can't have a multiplicity of 2 or higher First off, I'll analyze this function $$
f(z) = \frac{(z-a)^p (b-z)^{1-p}}{\text{P}(z)} \\
= \frac{|z-a|^p |b-z|^{1-p}}{\text{P}(z)} e^{i(p\arg(z-a) + (1-p)\arg(b-z))}
$$ The poles of this function are $z = c_k$ with order $q_k$ for $k = 1,2,3,\ldots, n$ To begin, I integrated $f(z)$ over the dogbone contour Which means I'll have $$
\oint_{\text{Dogbone}} f(z) dz = \left(\int_{\gamma_1} + \int_{\gamma_2} + \int_{\mu_1} + \int_{\mu_2}\right) f(z) dz
$$ If we call the radius of the $\mu$ paths $\varepsilon$ , and have it approach 0, then both integrals over $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ will go to 0 also. The integral over $\gamma_1$ will be $J$ and the integral over $\gamma_2$ will be $-e^{(1-p)2\pi} J$ . Which means $$
\oint_{\text{Dogbone}} f(z) dz = \left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J
$$ Now, to continue, we can inflate the contour into this I'll call the big circular contour $\Gamma$ and the small ones surrounding the poles at $c_k$ $\omega_k$ . Which means we'll have $$
\left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J = \left(\oint_\Gamma + \sum_{k=1}^n \oint_{\omega_k}\right) f(z) dz
$$ For the $\omega$ integrals, we can simply use residue theorem for higher order poles $$
\oint_{\omega_k} f(z) dz = - \frac{2\pi i}{(q_k - 1)!} \lim_{z \rightarrow c_k} \partial_z^{q_k - 1} (z-c_k)^{q_k} f(z)
$$ Plugging it back into the equation $$
\left(1 - e^{(1-p)2\pi}\right) J = \oint_\Gamma f(z) dz - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2 \pi i}{(q_k - 1)!} \lim_{z \rightarrow c_k} \partial_z^{q_k - 1} (z-c_k)^{q_k} f(z)
$$ Now, my main problem is the final integral. I know that it'll be the residue of $f(z)$ at infinity, I know there's a formula for it, but I have no idea of how to evaluate such residues. My guess is that it'll some how evaluate to 0, but still, I have no idea how that'll be the answer. 26/2 Edit: Fixed some of the mistakes in calculation + Thanks to @Diger for pointing out the mistake in the inflated contour","['integration', 'residue-calculus', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration', 'branch-cuts']"

4646425,Do these two definitions of ring of regular functions coincide?,"I'm following Gathmann's notes (from 2021) and I got to the section on regular functions (on affine varieties). He gives the following definition, which I believe is pretty standard: Definition 1. Let $X$ be an affine variety (not necessarily irreducible), and let $U$ be an open subset of $X$ . A regular function on $U$ is a map $\varphi\colon U \to K$ with the following property: for every $a\in U$ there are polynomial functions $f,g\in k[X]$ with $f(x)\neq 0$ and $\varphi(x) = \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}$ for all $x$ in an open subset $U_a$ with $a\in U_a\subseteq U$ . The set of all regular function on $U$ will be denoted $\mathcal{O}_X(U)$ . However, I don't find this definition very intuitive, specially when compared to other texts. For instance, an older version of the notes (from 2002), or Mukai's book, give an alternative one, which I think is more natural: Definition 2. Let $X$ be an irreducible affine variety. As its coordinate ring is an integral domain, it has a well defined field of fractions, called the set of rational functions on $X$ , which we denote as $k(X) := \mathrm{Quot}(k[X])$ . Given a point $P\in X$ , the set of rational functions on $X$ defined at $P$ is $$\mathcal{O}_{X,P} := \left\{\frac{f}{g}\in k(X)\colon g(P) \neq 0 \right\}.$$ Given an open set $U\subseteq X$ , the set of rational functions of $X$ defined on $U$ is the set $$\mathcal{O}_X(U) := \bigcap_{P\in U} \mathcal{O}_{X,P}$$ . I'm aware these sets are usually called the local ring of $X$ at $P$ , and the ring of regular functions of $X$ on $U$ , respectively. My first question is the following: Q1. Do these two definitions actually coincide? This question is prompted because the texts tend to emphasize the fact that the local representations of a regular function may vary from point to point, ie. there is not a global representation of a regular function on all of $U$ , necessarily. The thing is I'm failing to catch the local aspect of the second definition: Q2. How is the second definition local? In particular, I'm struggling to understand the meaning of this example: Example. Let $X:= \mathbb{V}(x_1x_4-x_2x_3)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^4_k$ , the open subset $U:= X - \mathbb{V}(x_2,x_4)\subseteq X$ . The function $$
(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4) \longmapsto \begin{cases}
 \frac{x_1}{x_2} &\text{if $x_2\neq 0$},\\
\frac{x_3}{x_4} &\text{if $x_4\neq 0$}
\end{cases}
$$ is easily seen as regular on $U$ in the sense of the first definition, and has no representation as a quotient that works in all of $U$ , which is fine by the definition. The thing is, I can't wrap my head around using the second definition to study this example. I don't think the function is regular according to that definition. I don't even think is in $k(X)$ . Q3. What is going on? Is the function actually regular in the sense of the second definition? How is it an element of $k(X)$ ? Thanks in advance.","['algebraic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"
4646441,Solving a gradient equation involving Jacobian of orthonormal vectors,"Revised to more specific question after realizing some steps Let $N(x)$ be a $K\times D$ matrix function of $x\in \mathbb{R}^D$ with orthonormal rows, so that $N(x)N(x)^T=I_{K\times K}$ . Let $\vec{n}_k$ be the $k$ -th row of $N$ , written as a column vector, and let $D[\vec{n}_k]$ be the Jacobian matrix of $\vec{n}_k$ . Consider the matrix equation $$P(x) \nabla \log p(x) = N(x)^T \vec{q}(x)+\sum_{k=1}^K D[\vec{n}_k(x)]\vec{n}_k(x),$$ where the vector $\vec{q}(x)$ has $r$ -th component $$q^r(x) = \operatorname{Tr}(N(x) D[n_r(x)] N^T(x)),$$ for $r=1,2,\dotsc, K$ and where $P(x)=I_{D\times D} - N(x)^T N(x)$ is the orthogonal projection of $\mathbb{R}^D$ onto the tangent space $T_x M$ at $x$ of some manifold $M$ , and the unknown $p(x)$ is a nice enough function of $x\in \mathbb{R}^D$ . Question: Can we solve this equation explicitly for the unknown function $p(x)$ ? Some simplifications and easy cases: When $K=1$ , and $\operatorname{Tr}(n(x)^T D[n(x)] n(x)) n=0$ we have $P(x)\nabla \log p(x) = D[n]n$ , I know how to proceed, see this answer . This more general case is giving me some trouble however. In general, notice that applying $P(x)$ to both sides of the original equation and using the fact that $P(x)^2=P(x)$ , that $D[\vec{n}_k(x)]\vec{n}_k(x)$ already lies on $T_x M$ , and that (suppresing notation on $x$ ) \begin{align*}
PN^T q &= (I-N^TN)N^T q\\
& = N^Tq -N^T N N^Tq\\
& = N^Tq - N^T I_{p\times p} q\\
& = N^Tq-N^Tq=\vec{0}
\end{align*} where we have used the orthogonality of $N$ , i.e. $NN^T=I_{K\times K}$ , we obtain the equation $$P \nabla \log p = \sum_{k=1}^K D[\vec{n}_k]\vec{n}_k.$$ It follows that $$\nabla \log p = \sum_{k=1}^K \left(D[\vec{n}_k] +c_kI_{D\times D} \right)\vec{n}_k$$ for some scalar functions $c_k$ (since $\{n_1,\dotsc, n_K\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the kernel of $P$ . It remains to show the RHS is a gradient, analogous to the case $K=1$ . I think it is possible to generalize the argument for $K=1$ but the exact details are escaping me at the moment, so I would appreciate any tips or ideas. Update 2/26/2023: When $N$ comes from orthonormalizing a Jacobian matrix $D[f]$ with full rank on $f^{-1}(\{0\})$ of some smooth function, and we also assume that the rows of $D[f]$ are already orthogonal then we can directly use the previous method linked above with the appropriate changes. We obtain in this case that $\sum_{k=1}^K D[\vec{n}_k]\vec{n}_k = \frac12 \nabla \left[\sum_{k=1}^K H_k\right] - \sum_{k=1}^K \mu_k \vec{n}_k$ and then we get that $$\nabla \log p(x) = \nabla \left[\sum_{k=1}^K \frac12 H_k\right]$$ $$ = \nabla \left[\log \prod_{k=1}^K \|\nabla f_k\|\right],$$ hence $p(x) = \prod_{k=1}^K \|\nabla f_k(x)\|$ . Here $H_k = 2\log \|\nabla f_k\|$ and $$\mu_k = \frac{1}{\|\nabla f_k\|} n_k^T (\nabla^2 f_k)n_k,$$ and $n_k = \nabla f_k / \|\nabla f_k\|$ . I have omitted a bit of the details but if anyone wants to see them I can add them in later when I have more time. In general, my conjecture is the solution is $p(x) = \sqrt{\det J_f(x) J_f(x)^T}$ , where $J_f := D[f]$ .","['linear-algebra', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

If I manage to prove some of the results in this special case, I will certainly go back to the general case $:$ doing the special case might help me tackle the general case.

4646532,size of tensor product,"In a recent intro to homological algebra, someone drew an analogy between tensoring and the geometric operation of intersecting varieties. (I didn't understand this as I don't know algebraic geometry.) But it left me with the following intuitive question: Why does taking the tensor product of $\mathbb{Z}$ -modules sometimes make things bigger and sometimes smaller? Examples: The tensor of free modules of finite rank is free of bigger rank. The tensor of the infinitely generated non-free module $\mathbb{Q}$ with itself is again itself. $\mathbb{Z}/2\otimes \mathbb{Z}/3 = 0$ . In general, the tensor of modules has annihilator something like the ideal sum of annihilators. Also contrastingly, the intersection of submodules $2\mathbb{Z}$ and $3\mathbb{Z}$ within $\mathbb{Z}$ is their ideal product, which is $6\mathbb{Z}$ , set-theoretically smaller. But isomorphic to both inputs as a module. Is there a ""geometric"" way of thinking that covers all of this?","['homological-algebra', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

If $V$ is the given potential, and $V_{\epsilon}$ is another potential whose eigenvalues and eigenstates are known, such that $\|V_\epsilon-V\|<\epsilon$ (in some norm) then if $E_{\epsilon}, E$ denote the ground state energies in $V_{\epsilon}, V$ respectively, then what is an estimate on $|E_{\epsilon}-E|$ ?

Since $\mu, \lambda$ are eigenvalues there exists, $x,y\neq 0$ such that $Ax=\mu x$ and $Ay=\lambda y$ .Then I claim that $x,y$ are fixed points: $$Tx=\frac{Ax}{\|Ax\|}=\frac{\mu x}{\|\mu x\|}=\operatorname{sign}(\mu)\frac{x}{\|x\|}=\frac{x}{\|x\|}=x$$ similarly one can show that $Ty=y$ .

4646752,Bumping Series and its Formula,"I was thinking of random series, popping up in mind, when I thought of one possible series in my head. It is as follows: The basic idea is, take a line of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ which goes till infinity, and add them. One visible thing here is that the most maximum highest number $\mathbb{N}_{max}$ would be $\mathbb{N}_{i}$ . In basic words, if we go till number 5, $\mathbb{N}_5$ then the height it reaches by summation is 5. Further, carrying on, we can get: The basic implication here is that we bump the numbers by specific $\mathbb{N}$ . At start, we take the beginning number, in our case it is 1, we move once up and then once down. Then we do it twice, thrice and so on. So 1 3 2 according to my diagram is one bump. At the ending $\mathbb{N}$ which is 2 here, we will jump it by 2 and make it low by 2. So it gets 2 5 12 7 4 . Here, assume $\mathbb{N}_i$ as the number of incrementation, before it was 1, now it is 2. We get different sets, with different terms, but total number of terms we get through this would be $2 \mathbb{N}_i + 1$ . Now, it will start from 4, go on making 3 jumps before landing by three terms. By this, we get series highlighted by circles in that triangular array as: 1, 3, 2, 5, 12, 7, 4, 9, 20, 44, 24, 13, 7, 15, 32, 68, 144, 76, 40, 21, 11, 23, 48, 100, 208, 432, 224, 116, 60, 31, 16...

Therefore, $$
\int_{\frac{k-1}{n}}^{\frac{k}{n}}f(t)dt = F\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) - F\left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right).
$$ From this, we deduce that: $$
a_n = \sum_{k =1}^n f\left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)\left[F\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) - F\left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)\right]
$$ Using Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, one can easily see that there exists $c_{k, n} \in \bigl( \frac{k-1}{n}, \frac{k}{n} \bigr)$ , so that: $$\frac{F(\frac{k}{n}) - F(\frac{k-1}{n})}{\frac{k}{n} - \frac{k-1}{n}} = F'(c_{k, n}) = f(c_{k, n})$$ Using this, we obtain that: $$
a_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^n f\left(\frac{k-1}{n}\right)f(c_{k, n})

Then, by choosing $\Delta = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \mathcal{D}([0, 1])$ , with $x_k = \frac{k}{n}$ , we realize that $\|\Delta\| = \frac{1}{n}$ , and then by choosing $\xi_k \in [x_{k - 1}, x_k]$ , $a_n$ is precisely the Riemann sum, thus because $f$ is Riemann integrable, and by Lebesgue's criterion, $f\cdot f = f^2$ is Riemann integrable: $$

My idea would be to write: $$
L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n - \int_0^1f^2(x) \, dx}{\frac{1}{n}}

Alternatively I tried this: $$\begin{aligned} \int x \sqrt{x^2 - x}\ dx &= \int x^2 \sqrt{1- \frac{1}{x}}dx\\ & \overset{1- \frac1x = t^2}{=} \int  \frac{2t^2}{(1-t^2)^4}\ dt\\& \overset{t =\sin(\theta)}{=} \int \frac{2\sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta)\ d\theta}{\cos^4(\theta)}\\& = \int 2 \tan(\theta)\tan(\theta) \sec(\theta) \ d\theta\\ & = \int 2\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta) - 1}\tan(\theta) \sec(\theta) \ d\theta\\&  \overset{\sec(\theta) = u}{=} \int 2 \sqrt{u^2 - 1}\ du\\& = u \sqrt{u^2 - 1} - \ln|u + \sqrt{u^2- 1}| + C\\& = \sqrt{x^2 - x} - \ln|x + \sqrt{x^2 - x}| + C\end{aligned}$$ This method is very tedious. Is there any easy way to do the original integral?,"['integration', 'indefinite-integrals', 'calculus']"
