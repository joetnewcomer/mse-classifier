198777,What is the generating set of the Vietoris topology?,"Here is what Kechris says about the Vietoris topology, Let X be a top. space. We denote by K(X) the space of all compact subsets of X equipped with the Vietoris topology, i.e., the one generated by the sets of the form $\{K \in K(X):K \subseteq U\}$ and $\{K \in K(X): K \cap U \neq \emptyset\}$ for U open in X. 1) Isn't $K \subseteq U$ redundant?  Can we not just say $K \subseteq X$? EDIT: Is the definition above ""for all U"", or ""for a fixed U""? EDIT2:  The problem that is seeming to stump me is that if we take U=X then it seems we will get all the compact sets.","['general-topology', 'set-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"
198793,Why are squares chosen as a weighting method for quantifying the deviations from a mean?,"Reading about variance and it occurred to me that this squaring business seems to be used many places in statistics. I think I understand that the square is used to help ""weight"" values which are further from the mean more heavily, so they don't get swallowed up in when there are a lot of less-deviant values?
but, why was squaring chosen, and not cubing?
Are there situations where it would make more sense to cube the deviations and not square them? Or was squaring just chosen because it made the deviations powerful, but not too powerful?",['statistics']

There exists a Moishezon manifold which is not projective for example and I believe that Moishezon manifold form a good class of manifolds. The existence of the non-projective Moishezon manifold surprised me because there are lots of meromorphic functions on it; in my understanding (it turns out to be incorrect), a non-projective compact complex manifold has very few meromorphic functions and very few complex submanifolds. My question is how should one think of the difference among projective manifolds, non-projective manifolds, and Moishezon manifold?

198886,How strong is the statement that Thompson F is amenable?,"Justin Moore's proof turned out to have an error I just attended Justin Moore's talk on this today. Since I am neither a group theorist nor a combinatorist, and is not familiar with ultrafilters I cannot judge the correctness of his proof. But more elementary - if Thompson's group F is amenable, what would this signify? Can we deduce some non-elementary results from this statement? I was not able to ask this in person, but it seems this would imply the amenability of some other related groups as well. Any comments, answer, etc are welcome. I suspect this is too low for mathoverflow (as I am not a researcher in this field) so I ask in here. To cite the background, the wikipedia link on Thompson group F is here . Justin Moore's proof is here . Some related mathoverflow question can be found at here , here , and there . I have read about 60 pages' paper not related to Justin Moore's proof on F in the past, and raise the question under this context. Also, often that the statement itself is not significant (like Fermat's last theorem), but what mathematical structure the proof involved is important. So any comments, answers, etc on that direction is also welcome. I personally felt very surprised and happy to know ramsey theory was lurking in the background of the proof. A summary of Justin's proof is this (borrowed from others): The definition of amenability of a group G demands
a. a positive measure m defined on all subsets of G
b. m(G) = 1
c. m is finitely additive
d. m is invariant under left mult by elements of G. The motivation for the definition is that amenable groups acting on
other spaces allow for measures on the space with the properties above. Often a space can be found with a G action so that if a measure with
the properties above can be found then the group is amenable. For F, such a space is the space T of all finite binary trees. The spaces of trees T has a binary operation.
(Trees A and B are made into a tree A^B whose left subtree is
A and right subtree is B). The space M of measures on T having all the properties but (d)
inherits a binary operation from the binary operation ^ on T. An idempotent in M will have (d) and prove the amenability of F. There is a famous lemma that finds idempotents in spaces that
are compact and have an associative operation. The space M is (I think) compact, but the operation is not
associative. Moore's work is 30% proving (7) above and 70% generalizing
the result (8) to the non-associative setting of the binary
operation on M.","['logic', 'amenability', 'geometric-group-theory', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics']"

198980,"Holomorphic extension to a perfect, nowhere dense set.","Suppose $f$ is holomorphic and uniformly bounded by $M$ on $\mathbb{C}\setminus E$, where $E$ is perfect and nowhere dense? Can $f$ be extended to a holomorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$? Riemann's theorem on removable singularities let's you remove one singularity $\{a\}$ at a time, provided $f$ is holomorphic and bounded on $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{a\}$. I suspect that the proof may be tailored in this case, since $E$ is nowhere dense, but would like your help on this. Furthermore, as is usual in cases of ""I want to do something uncountably many times, but only have a method for doing it once"", it seems natural to invoke Zorn's Lemma, so I tried: Let $\mathfrak{F}$ be the collection of all pairs $\{(F,\Omega)\}$ satisfying: $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$. $\mathbb{C}\setminus E\subseteq \Omega$ $F: \Omega\to \mathbb{C}$ is uniformly bounded by $M$ and is holomorphic. $F\mid_{C\setminus E}=f$ Since $f\in \mathfrak{F}$, it's nonempty. So we may define a partial order on $\mathfrak{F}$ by declaring that $(F,\Omega)\le (G,\Omega')$ if: $\Omega\subseteq \Omega'$ $G\mid_{\Omega}=F$ Now if $\{(F_{\alpha},\Omega_{\alpha})\}$ is a chain in $(\mathfrak{F},\le)$, we set $O=\bigcup_{\alpha\in A}F_{\alpha}$ and $F(x)=f_{\alpha}(x)$ for all $x\in \Omega_{\alpha}$. It is clear that $O$ is open, does not meet $E$, and that $F$ is well-defined, uniformly bounded by $M$, and $F\mid_{C\setminus E}=f$. It remains to show that $F$ is holomorphic. So here's my try: pick $a\in O$. Find $\epsilon>0$ so that $B(a,\epsilon)\subseteq O$ and $\overline{(B(a,\frac{\epsilon}{2}))}\subseteq O$. Then the closed ball is compact and, being covered by $\{\Omega_{\alpha}\}$, admits a finite subcover. Since they lie in a chain, there exists some $\alpha^*$ for which $a\in \Omega_{\alpha^*}$. But $F=F_{\alpha^*}$ on $\Omega_{\alpha^*}$, and so taking difference quotients shows that $F$ is holomorphic at $a$. So $F\in \mathfrak{F}$, and hence $(F,O)$ is clearly an upper bound (if this all worked) on the chain. By Zorn's Lemma, there exists some maximal element $(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{O})$. I claim that $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{C}$. It is clear that there must be some $a\in E$ for which $a\not\in E$. But now we run through the proof of Riemann's Removable Singularity Theorem and find an extension of $F$ to...what!? $E$ has no isolated points, so I'm out of luck. I can't extend $F$ in a way to contradict its maximality. Does anyone have an idea of how to fix this, or do this in general? The question I'm actually interested in knowing is if one embeds the Cantor Set into $\mathbb{C}$ and finds a holomorphic function $F$ that is uniformly bounded on the complement of the Cantor set, can one extend it to all of $\mathbb{C}$.

198990,The Argument Principle used to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,"Greene and Krantz pose the following problem in Function Theory of One Complex Variable , Ch. 5 problem 3: Give another proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra as follows:
  Let $P(z)$ be a non-constant polynomial. Fix $Q\in \mathbb{C}$.
  Consider 
  \begin{equation}
 \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\partial D(Q,R)} \frac{P'(z)}{P(z)}\,dz. 
\end{equation}
  Argue that as $R\to +\infty$, this
  expression tends to a nonzero constant. I was thinking along these lines: Since we do not know $P(z)$ factors completely, let us write
$$ P(z) = \prod_j (z - \alpha_j) \, g(z),$$
where $g(z)$ is an irreducible polynomial. Now
$$ \frac{P'(z)}{P(z)} = \sum_k \frac{1}{z-\alpha_k} + \frac{g'(z)}{g(z)}.$$
Each of the terms $1/(z-\alpha_k)$ adds $1$ to the integral expression. As $R \to \infty$, all the $\alpha_k$ are eventually inside $D(Q,R)$, whereas the term $g'(z)/g(z)$ approaches zero, since the denominator has a higher degree.
Is the reasoning correct ? Can someone offer a simpler argument ?",['complex-analysis']

By the Rellich-Kondrakov theorem, $H^1(\Omega)$ is compact in $L^2(\Omega)$. Suppose $u_n\rightharpoonup u$ in $H^1$, and that $\|u_n\|_2=1$ for all $n$. It follows that the convergence is strong in $L^2$ by taking a subsequence. Call this limit $v$. Question: Is $u = v$? I suspect not, but would like a counterexample! Suppose $u\neq v$. Then $u_n$ cannot converge to $v$ weakly, since weak limits are unique. Then there is at least one $f\in H^{-1}$ such that $\langle u_n-v, f\rangle\nrightarrow 0$.

$\mathcal{F} ( f ) = \frac{\displaystyle \int\limits_{-1}^1 \int\limits_{-1}^1 \left( \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2 f(x) f(y) - g(x) g (y) \right) \frac{\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} |x - y|\right)}{|x - y|} \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y}{\displaystyle \int\limits_{-1}^1 \int\limits_{-1}^1 \left( \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2 f(x) f(y) - g(x) g (y) \right) \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} |x - y|\right)}{|x - y|} \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y} = \displaystyle\frac{\mathcal{W}(f)}{\mathcal{P}(f)},\qquad(1)$ where the function $g(x)$ has a form of $g(x) = \displaystyle\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}.\qquad(2)$ and similarly for $g(y)$. Moreover, you know the boundary condition $f(-1) = f(1) = 0 \qquad(3)$ (Dirichlet B.C.). Expression (1) has a form of energetic functional which can be discretized to the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP): $F(f) = \displaystyle\frac{\langle f, \mathbf{X} f \rangle}{\langle f, \mathbf{R} f \rangle} = \frac{W(f)}{P(f)}, \qquad(4)$ where $\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{X}$ are square $(N \times N)$ symmetric matrices. Some of you probably know the Method of moments in electrodynamics, where the resultant impedance matrix is $\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{R} + \jmath \mathbf{X}$. Problem is ,that the GEP (4) says that there is a function $f_0(x)$ in natural resonance for which the numerator and denumerator in (1) are: $W(f_0) = 0$ and $P(f_O) = \max $, respectively. So, my question is: Can you find analytical function $f_0$ that causes $\mathcal{W}(f_0) = 0$ and $\mathcal{P}(f_0) = \max$. Note, that the second condition quarantees the uniqueness of solution. And additionally: Do you know any transformation of (1) which transforms the double integration (convolution) to the single integration? Many thanks. Edit1 : Is it possible to prove that (1) converges only for the function $f(x) = \sin(\pi x/2)$? Edit2 /Based on latest comments/ : Well, here's the transition from the 3D to the 1D functional (1). We started from the following functional: $\mathcal{F} ( \mathbf{J} ) = \frac{\displaystyle \iiint\limits_{\Omega} \iiint\limits_{\Omega'} \left(k^2 \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}') - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}) \nabla ' \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}') \right) \frac{\cos \left(k R \right)}{R} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}'}{\displaystyle \iiint\limits_{\Omega} \iiint\limits_{\Omega'} \left(k^2 \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}') - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}) \nabla ' \cdot \mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}') \right) \frac{\sin \left(k R \right)}{R} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}'} = \displaystyle\frac{\mathcal{W}(f)}{\mathcal{P}(f)},\qquad(5)$ where $R = ||\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}'||$ is the Euclidean distance, $\Omega$ is region containing all sources (i.e., only here is $\mathbf{J}\neq 0$), $\mathbf{J}$ is arbitrary vector function with Dirichlet B.C. on boundary of $\Omega$ (noted as $\partial\Omega$) and tangential to the surface $\partial\Omega$ ($\mathbf{J}$ is actually current density on a perfect electric conductor). Functional (5) is derived from Maxwell theory, Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE), Poynting and some other theorems. We tested it numerically with great success. If we stress the region $\Omega$ to straight thin-wire (1D object) and define as yet-unknown function $\mathbf{J} = I(x) \delta(y) \delta(z) \, \mathbf{x}_0 \sim f(x),\qquad(6)$ where $\delta$ is delta function and $\mathbf{x}_0$ is unit vector pointing in $x$-direction, then according to the definition of divergence $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \frac{\partial _k J_k}
{\partial_k x_k} = \frac{\partial I(x)}{\partial x}\,\delta (y)\,\delta (z),\qquad (7)$ from (6) we have $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \frac{\partial I(x)}{\partial x} \delta(y) \delta(z) \sim \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x},\qquad(8)$. After assumptions (5)-(8) we can conclude, that 1D variation of (5) is (1).

Let's stipulate that the models have the same number of parameters, $k$, and that $SSE_{Model 1} = SSE_{Model 2}$.  The only difference is that residuals from Model 1 'appear' to be more systematic than those in Model 2.  That is, upon examining the residuals for Model 1 along the dimension $x$, it becomes clearly apparent that there are areas along $x$ where $Prob(\epsilon_i \ge 0 | x_i) > .5$ - and there are areas along $x$ where $Prob(\epsilon_j \ge 0 | x_j) < .5$. Since a test of just $SSE$ would rule that the two models are equivalent (as both models have the same overall error measurement) - and since the number of parameters, $k$, is the same for both models, the usual tests, Mallow's CP, Akaike's AIC & Schwarz's BIC wouldn't discriminate.  Yet, I can see with my eyes that one model has more (or at least a less-random pattern of) systematic error than the other. Yes, I know that this probably means that neither model is the 'correct' model, but I'm constrained to select between the given choices of models. I don't know of a test (other than just 'eyeballing' the residuals) that would allow me to decide between the alternatives. Is there a formal test, perhaps one based upon the pattern of residuals, that would allow me to discriminate?  I could see something that perhaps stepped through the various values of $x$ and tested as the null hypothesis that the residuals are such that $Prob(\epsilon_{segment} \ge 0|x_{segment}) = .5$. Perhaps the model where the cumulative stepwise test is most false would be the model that I should select against. Any ideas?","['statistics', 'mathematical-modeling', 'mean-square-error']"

How far does the rabbit run before the dog catches him? (b)  Assume now that $a=b$, and find $y$ as a function of $x$.  How close does the dog come to the rabbit? Example 1.21 A rabbit begins at the origin and runs up the $y-axis$ with speed $a$ feet per second.  At the same time, a dog runs at speed $b$ from the point $(c,0)$ in pursuit of the rabbit.  What is the path of the dog? Solution:  At time $t$, measured from the instant both the rabbit and the dog start, the rabbit will be at the point $R=(0,at)$ and the dog at $D=(x,y)$.  We wish to solve for $y$ as a function of $x$. $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{y-at}{x}$$ $$xy'-y=-at$$ $$xy''=-a\frac{dt}{dx}$$ Since the $s$ is a arc length along the path of the dog, it follows that $\frac{ds}{dt}=b$.  Hence, $$\frac{dt}{dx}=\frac{dt}{ds}\frac{ds}{dx}=\frac{-1}{b}\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$$ $$xy''=\frac{a}{b}\sqrt{1+(y')^2}$$ For convenience, we set $k=\frac{a}{b}$,   $y'=p$, and $y''=\frac{dp}{dx}$ $$\frac{dp}{\sqrt{1+p^2}}=k\frac{dx}{x}$$ $$\ln\left({p+\sqrt{1+p^2}}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^k$$ Now, solve for $p$: $$\frac{dy}{dx}=p=\frac{1}{2}\Bigg(\left(\frac{x}{c}\right)^k-\left(\frac{c}{x}\right)^k\Bigg)$$ In order to continue the analysis, we need to know something about the relative sizes of $a$ and $b$.

199609,Groupification and perfection of a commutative monoid,"The following definitions and proposition are taken from the paper The geometry of Frobenioids I by S. Mochizuki. Let $\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$ be the set of positive integers.
$\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$ is a directed set by the order relation $a|b$.
Let $M$, $N$ be commutative monoids(the binary operations are written additively).
A map $f\colon M \rightarrow N$ is called a morphism if $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ for any $x, y$ and $f(0) = 0$. For every $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$, the multiplication map $x \rightarrow nx$ on $M$ is a morphism. $M$ is said to be torsion-free if $nx = 0$ implies $x = 0$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$. Let $M^{gp}$ be the groupification of $M$, i.e. the grothendieck group of $M$.
Let $\psi\colon M \rightarrow M^{gp}$ be the canonical map.
If $\psi$ is injective, $M$ is said to be integral . $M$ is said to be saturated if $na \in \psi(M)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$ and $a \in M^{gp}$, then $a \in \psi(M)$. $M$ is said to be perfect if the multiplication map $x \rightarrow nx$ is bijective for every $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$. The perfection $M^{pf}$ of $M$ is defined as follows.
Let $M_a = M$ for every $a \in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$.
if $a|b$, we define a morphism $f_{ba}\colon M_a \rightarrow M_b$ by $f_{ba}(x) = (b/a)x$.
Then $(M_a)_{a\in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}}$ and $(f_{ba})$ consitute a direct(or inductive) system.
We define $M^{pf} = colim_{a\in \mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}} M_a$.
There exists the canonical morphism $\phi\colon M = M_1 \rightarrow M^{pf}$. My question: How do we prove the following proposition? Proposition (1) $\phi\colon M \rightarrow M^{pf}$ is injective if $M$ is torsion-free, integral, and saturated. (2) $M$ is perfect if and only if $\phi$ is an isomorhism. Motivation Recently(August, 2012), S. Mochizuki submitted a series of papers( Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory I,II,III,IV ) which develops his new theory. As an application of his theory, he wrote a proof of ABC conjecture.
I think the validity of the proof has not yet been confirmed by other mathematicians.
However, considering his track record, I think it's worthwhile to read the papers.

Since $\|\cdot\|_A \leq \|\cdot\|_B$, there are more poins in $B_{\|\cdot\|_A}(0,1)$ than in $B_{\|\cdot\|_B}(0,1)$. In particular, there is a point that is in $B_{\|\cdot\|_A}(0,1)$ but not in $B_{\|\cdot\|_B}(0,1)$. Around this point we cannot make an epsilon $A$-ball that is contained in the $B$-unit-ball. Hence the $B$-unit ball is not open in the $A$-topology, hence the $B$-topology is coarser than the $A$-topology.

199692,Binary Logistic Regression Model Processing,"Thanks for showing interest and wanting to help out. My aim is to develop a model that - as accurately as possible - predicts how entities in a population will either cooperate or defect, as a % of total population. For this purpose, I have 70 predictor variables, however, not all of them may be significant (some are though). There could be a degree of multicollinearity for these variables. There are other variables that could potentially affect the outcome, but they are currently unknown. I have approximately 300 datapoints. So far, I have used the glmfit function in Matlab to create a binary logistic regression model for all predictor variables. Now, my statistics expertise is limited at best (I'm sorry about that), and I struggle to choose how to proceed at this point. I would very much appreciate if you could help me out with solving following questions in matlab: How do I best assess the accuracy of the model? Would it be better to reduce the number of predictor variables to
improve the accuracy of the model? If so, how should I best do this? How do I check whether multicollinearity is significant? If so, what
actions should I take to improve the model? What outputs/plots should I produce to demonstrate the above? Finally, is there a better way of doing things? I would very much appreciate your help. Sorry if some of this seems basic - I assure you I have read up on this, but I find myself unable to make an informed decision as to how I should proceed to obtain optimum results. Thank you very much for your time. EDIT:
For example, would it be a good idea to look at the individual p-values for all the predictors and eliminate all those that fail a chosen significance level (say 0.05), then reconstructing the model with predictors that pass the test, and then see whether a better deviance (D) is obtained? How would I be able to judge whether the model is suitable, even if the deviance is better? Is there a better way of doing this? I just don't understand the maths behind these statistics well enough in order to choose an effective strategy. EDIT 2:

Likewise, if event C happens, event B cannot happen.  It is possible that neither event B or C will happen, but they can’t both happen. Consider the possibilities, starting with whether event B happens. If event B occurs, event C cannot occur, so there is no way for both event A and event C to happen.

Thus, the probability that both event A and event C will occur is the probability that B will NOT happen, A will happen, and C will happen.  {NOTE:  ""and"" means multiply probabilities, ""or"" would mean add probabilities.} P(A and C) = P(not B) × P(A) × P(C)
  P(A and C) = [1 – 0.3] × 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.7 × 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.07 = 7% The correct answer is 7% Source: http://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/ChallengeProblems/LastWeek/ My question is: 1) P(A,C) = 0.07 in this question. However, this is not P(A)*P(C)=0.10, despite A and C are independent. Why does the rule P(A,C) = P(A)*P(C) fail even though A and C are independent? Is there a certain restraint that applies to this rule? 2) Event B and C are not independent. However, the problem states that P(A,C,~B) = P(A)*P(C)*P(~B). I thought this was possible only if C and ~B are independent. Can you please explain if this is valid? Your help is greatly appreciated. Have a wonderful day.",['probability']
199859,Is the 'arc-' notation for inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions discouraged?,"Any books we've used throughout high school and university preferred the '^-1' notation, leading me to believe that the 'arc-' notation is archaic. It feels like we're taught it, but discouraged from using it (similar to the situation between Imperial and SI units). Is this true? If not, then is this notation more widespread outside of Canada and the States?","['notation', 'trigonometry']"
199860,Nirenberg-Gagliardo- Sobolev inequalities,"I need a small help in understanding the following that how ""Nirenberg -Gagliardo-Sobolev inequalities"" were used. This is a part of the paper. Denote

H^1=W^{1, 2}(\Omega)\\
V_1=\{ f\in  H^2 (\Omega) : \frac{\partial f}{\partial n}|_{\partial \Omega} =0\}\\
H_2=\{ f\in L^2(\Omega)^2: \nabla . f =0,~ f.n=0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega\}\\
V_2 = \{ f\in H^1_0(\Omega)^2 : \nabla . f =0\}
$$ Let $C \in L^2(0, \tau ; V_1) \cap L^\infty (0, \tau; H^1)$ and $u \in L^2(0, \tau ; V_2) \cap L^\infty (0, \tau; H_1)$ are bounded. By $|\cdot|$ we denote the norm on both in $L^2(\Omega)$ and $l^2(\Omega)^2$ where
$\Omega$ a bounded regular open set in $\mathbb{R^2}$, with boundary $\partial \Omega$. Now given equation is $ C'_t = d \Delta C - u . \nabla C$  we have $$
|\frac{\partial  C}{\partial t}| \leq | d \Delta C| + |u . \nabla C|\qquad \text{ triangle inequality}
$$
$$
\leq  d\|\Delta C |  ~+~\|u\|_{L^4(\Omega)^2} \|\nabla C\|_{L^4(\Omega)^2}\qquad\text{How?}

$$
\leq  d\|\Delta C | + M |u|^{1/2} \|u\|^{1/2}_{H^1(\Omega)^2} \|C\|^{1/2}_{H^1(\Omega)} \|C\|^{1/2}_{H^2(\Omega)}\qquad\text{How is this for some $M>0$?}

If the number wouldn't change the probability would just increase every guess, giving in the end a probability of 1. If the number changes every guess tough, you just have a 1/1000th chance everytime. Can it be calculated how many attempts it would probably take, on average?

So the sum is equal to $-1 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} = -1 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{2n + 1}{n^2(n+1)^2}$. Which got me nowhere.
