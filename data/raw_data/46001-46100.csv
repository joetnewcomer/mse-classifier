460727,Computing Conjugacy Classes of Subgroups in GAP,"GAP has the command ConjugacyClassesSubgroups which gives a list of the conjugacy classes of a finite group $G$.  Is there a way I can specify further what types of subgroups GAP reports?  For instance, can I ask GAP to only list conjugacy classes of subgroups of a certain order or isomorphism type? I'm interested in computing $p$-groups, and I'm hoping to cut down on computation time by instructing GAP to ignore all other subgroups.

460729,What would have been our number system if humans had more than 10 fingers? Try to solve this puzzle.,"Try to solve this puzzle: The first expedition to Mars found only the ruins of a civilization.
  From the artifacts and pictures, the explorers deduced that the
  creatures who produced this civilization were four-legged beings with
  a tentatcle that branched out at the end with a number of grasping
  ""fingers"". After much study, the explorers were able to translate
  Martian mathematics. They found the following equation:
  $$5x^2 - 50x + 125 = 0$$
  with the indicated solutions $x=5$ and $x=8$. The value $x=5$ seemed
  legitimate enough, but $x=8$ required some explanation. Then the explorers 
  reflected on the way in which Earth's number system developed, and found
  evidence that the Martian system had a similar history. How many fingers would 
  you say the Martians had? $(a)\;10$ $(b)\;13$ $(c)\;40$ $(d)\;25$ P.S. This is not a home work. It's a question asked in an interview.","['puzzle', 'number-systems', 'algebra-precalculus']"

460757,Sequence is universal net if and only if eventually constant,"Definition : A net in a topological space $X$ is universal if for any $A\subseteq X$, either the net is eventually in $A$ or it is eventually in $X\setminus A$. Problem : A sequence is a universal net if and only if it is eventually constant. I've shown that if a sequence is eventually constant, then it is universal. I'm trying to figure out the other direction. My attempt : Let $X$ be a topological space, $\Phi \colon \mathbb{Z}^+ \to X$ be a sequence, and suppose $\Phi$ is not eventually constant. Consider two cases. Case 1: There is an element $x_0\in X$ such that $\Phi(n) = x_0$ for infinitely many $n$. In this case, let $A = \{x_0\}$. Then given any $n$, there exists $m\geq n$ and $k\geq n$ such that $\Phi(m) = x_0\in A$ and $\Phi(k) \neq x_0$ so $\Phi(k) \notin A$. Thus $\Phi$ cannot eventually be in $A$ nor can it eventually be in $X\setminus A$, so $\Phi$ is not universal. Case 2: There are infinitely many elements in $\Phi(\mathbb{Z}^+)$, each appearing finitely many times in the sequence. To finish case 2, I would now like to define two disjoint subsequences (in that they share no common elements), which I think should be possible. This would then finish the proof. However, I cannot think of a way to do this precisely. Question : Is this proof going in the right direction?","['general-topology', 'nets']"

460823,isometries of the sphere,"There is a theorem by Pogorelov that if a $C^2$ surface $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is isometric to the unit 2-sphere, then $M$ is itself (a rigid motion of) the sphere. What is known about isometric deformations of the sphere, when the smoothness condition is relaxed? First, we need some notion of isometry for surfaces with singularities. Intuitively, if I take a piece of paper and crease it, the creased paper is still isometric in a weaker sense to the original flat sheet. More generally, for any topological surface embedded in $\mathbb{R^3}$, shortest distance between two points can still be well-defined as the (possibly infinite) infimum of the arc lengths of all curves on the surface joining the two points. An isometry is then any homeomorphism that preserves this distance. Is anything known about the isometries of the sphere, when the surface is no required to remain $C^2$? Perhaps it's easier to look at isometric deformations -- continuous functions $f(s):\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}^3$ with $f(0)$ the identity, and $f(s)$ an isometry of the unit sphere for all $s$. There are some obvious isometric deformations of the sphere, for instance, cutting the sphere along a latitude, inverting one piece, and gluing it back on:
$$f(s): (x,y,z)\mapsto (x,y, s-1+|z+1-s|)$$
and of course this deformation can be done at any point on the sphere, not just the south pole, and at different speeds, generating a large family of isometric deformations of the sphere. Are there any others? Have the isometries been classified?","['geometry', 'surfaces', 'metric-geometry']"
460832,"Let $ X $ be compact and let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a local homeomorphism. Show that for any point $y \in Y$, $f^{-1}(y)$ is a finite set.","PROBLEM: Let $ X $ be compact and let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be a local homeomorphism. Show that for any point $y \in Y$, $f^{-1}(y)$ is a finite set. I was trying out this problem from Massey, but got stuck. MY ATTEMPT: My thought was to pick an open neighborhood $U_i$ of arbitrary but fixed $y_i \in Y$, then show that $U_i$ is evenly covered by $f$, so $f^{-1}(U_i)$ is a disjoint union of open sets in $X$, $f^{-1}(U_i) = \underset{\alpha \in X} \amalg V_{{y_i}_{\alpha}} $ such that for each $\alpha$, $f|_{V_{{y_i}_{\alpha}}}: V_{{y_i}_{\alpha}} \rightarrow U$ is a surjective homeomorphism. This also implies $f$ is a covering map. Then $X = \underset{\alpha \in X}\amalg V_{{y_1}_{\alpha}} \cup \underset{\alpha \in X}\amalg V_{{y_2}_{\alpha}} ...$, which is an open covering. Since $X$ is compact, that means there is a finite subcover. Specifically, this means only finitely many $f^{âˆ’1}(U_i) = \underset{\alpha \in X} \amalg V_{{y_i}_{\alpha}}$ cover $f^{-1}(y_i)$ for each $y_i$. Does this outline seem correct? I have a problem at the beginning, not knowing how to use the local homeomorphism to show that $f$ evenly covers $U_i$, and I'm not sure about if my conclusion appropriately proves the statement.","['general-topology', 'compactness']"

460877,Statistical Significance level - elementary level,"Let's say one day my sister tells me she has psychic powers and can help me predict the winners in horse racing games and for whatever reason, we only have 2 horse racers in a game. She tells me that if she chooses 'blue', then the blue horse wins (painted blue okay?) and if she chooses 'red', then the red horse wins. She does this $8$ times and it turns out she was correct on all of them, making me very wealthy. Now is this a fluke or not? Let's test this at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$ Assuming my sister isn't really a psychic, then I expect she would be correct half the time. This yields $\mu = 4$. So my null hypothesis is $\mu = 4$ and my alternative would be $\mu = 8 > 4$. Let $X$ be the random variable denoting the ""number of correct predictions my sister makes"". So $X \sim Bin(8,1/2)$ and I did $P(X = 8| \mu = 4) = (1/2)^8 \approx 0 < 0.05$. This leads me to conclude I should reject my initial null hypthosis and conclude my sister may be a psychic. However this seems to go against any intuition since my sister is actually only 3 years old, and I probably made a Type I Error. Is this a correct analysis?",['statistics']
460887,How can one tell if a sequence is well-defined; is the axiom of choice needed?,"This question is in the context of the following exercise:
Let $X$ be a first countable topological space, let $A \subseteq X$, and let $x \in X$ with $x \in \overline{A}$. Then there exists a sequence $\{a_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq A$ with $a_{n} \rightarrow x$. My work: Let $\{U_{i}\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a countable nbhd base for $x$. Consider the sequence $\{\cap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. Each $\cap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i}$ contains an element of $A$. Call this element $a_{n}$. Then $a_{n} \rightarrow x$ because if $\mathcal{O}$ is an open nbhd of x, there's some $j$ such that $U_{j} \subseteq \mathcal{O}$. Then $a_{n} \in \cap_{i=1}^{n}U_{i} \subseteq \cap_{i=1}^{j}U_{i} \in \mathcal{O}$ for all $n \geq j$. My question is: is it o.k. to form a sequence in that way? Do we get the information of what the points $a_{n}$ are all at once?

460915,Improper Multiple Integral,"I am trying to solve the following exam problem: Let $s$ be a real number.  Find the condition under which the improper integral $$I:=\iint_{\mathbb R^2} \frac{dxdy}{(x^2-xy+y + 1)^s}$$ converges, and obtain the values of $I$ for the values of $s$ that makes $I$ converge. I tried to solve it in the following way. I transform the coordinate system from $(x,y)$ to $(\xi,\eta)$, so that the quadratic form $x^2-xy+y^2$ in the denominator may become of the form $a\xi^2+b\eta^2$.  Then I rewrite the integral by using a ""distorted"" polar coordinate (in the shape of an ellipse, not of a circle), and then $I$ is a multiple of the integral $$ J:=\int_0^\infty \frac{dr}{(r^2+1)^s}.$$ So $I$ converges if and only if $s>1/2$ (is it true?). By letting $\tan \phi := r$, I have $J = \int_0^{\pi/2}\cos^{s-2}\phi\ d\phi$. The problem is how to evaluate the last integral for general $s>1/2$.  I would appreciate if you could give a clue, or suggest some other way to attack the original problem.","['multivariable-calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration']"

460931,Prove $f=x^p-a$ either irreducible or has a root. (arbitrary characteristic) (without using the field norm) [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Irreducibility of a polynomial if it has no root (Capelli) [duplicate] (3 answers) Closed 10 years ago . Let $K$ be an arbitrary field, $p$ a prime and $a\in K$. Show $f=x^p-a$ is either irreducible in
  $K[x]$ or has a root in $K$. My strategy was to split this up into a case for each characteristic. The characteristic $p$ case is easy. Assume $f$ is reducible $=gh$ both smaller degree $g$ irreducible, with $\alpha$ a root of $g$. Then in $K(\alpha)[x]$, $f=(x-\alpha)^p$. So $g=(x-\alpha)^k$, and all the other factors of $f$ are of the same form. Hence they are all equal to the $minpoly(\alpha)$ and the degree of $minpoly(\alpha)|p$ so it is $1$ or $p$ and we are done. The characteristic $0$ case  and characteristic $q\ne p$ I get stuck on. If $K$ contains a primitive $p$th root of unity $\zeta$, then over $K(\alpha)$, $f$ splits into linear factors. So the degree of the field extension for any root of $f$ is the same, so the degree of such a root is either $1$ or $p$. If $K$ does not have a primitive $p$th root of unity, then simply adjoin one. We know $[K(\zeta):K]|p-1$ and by the previous step either $f$ is irreducible over $K(\zeta)$ or splits into linear factors. If it is irreducible we are done, if not we have it splits into linear factors of the form $x-\zeta^ia^{1/p}$, but I am unsure what to do from here. The characteristic $q$ case seems similar to the characteristic $0$ case but again I am stuck trying to finish the proof. Some googling has lead me to believe that this problem is generally approached using the field norm and if an accessible online reference exists I would love to see it, but I feel that in the context I have seen it should be entirely possible that this is done without needing the norm. As I have not seen the field norm before, I would like to know if there is a possible way to prove this without using it and hopefully that follows in the same vein my attempt at a proof did.","['field-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

460959,Where in the proof did Herstein use the fact that $A$ is a two-sided ideal of $R$?,"I'm reading Noncommutative Rings by I. N. Herstein . The theorem I'm having trouble with is 1.2.5, on page 16 of the book. Some definition 1. Regular ideal An ideal $\rho \subset R$ is called a regular ideal right ideal of $R$ iff There exists a $r \in R$, such that $x - rx \in \rho, \forall x \in R$. 2. Right quasi-regular element $a$ is called the right-quasi element of $R$, is we can find $r \in R$, such that $a + r + ar = 0$. Such $r$ is called a right-quasi inverse of $a$. 3. Right quasi-regular ideal An ideal $\rho \subset R$ is called a right-quasi regular ideal iff every element of it is right-quasi regular. 3. Simple module A right $R-$module $M$ is called simple iff the two requirements below hold: $MR \neq 0$. $M$ has no non-trivial submodule. 4. Jacobson radical The Jacobson radical is the set of all elements in $R$ that annihilate all simple $R-$modules. Some properties $J(R) = \bigcap\limits_{M \text{ simple $R-$module}}\text{Ann}(M) = \bigcap\limits_{\rho \text{ regular, maximal right ideal of } R} \rho$ $M$ is a right, simple $R-$module iff there's some maximal, regular right ideal $\rho \subset R$, such that $M \cong R/\rho$. Every right-quasi regular ideal is contained in $J(R)$, and $J(R)$ is the maximal ideal amongst the set of right-quasi ideals of $R$. And this is a theorem I'm having trouble with. Theorem 1.2.5 (page 16) If $A$ is a two-sided ideal of $R$, then $J(A) = A \cap J(R)$. Proof We'll now prove that $A \cap J(R) \subset J(A)$: Let $a \in A \cap J(R)$, since $a \in J(R)$, as an element of $J(R)$, $a$ is right-quasi, hence there exists an $a'$, such that $a + a' + aa' = 0$, so $a' = -a -aa' \in A$, since $A$ is an ideal of $R$. Being a right-quasi ideal of $A$, $A \cap J(R) \subset J(A)$. We'll now prove that $A \cap J(R) \supset J(A)$: For every maximal, regular right ideal $\rho$ of $R$, let $\rho_A = A \cap \rho$. Now, there can only be 2 cases: $A \not \subset \rho$, since $\rho$ is maximal, $A + \rho = R$, and combining the two, we'll have:
$$R/\rho \cong (A + \rho) / \rho \cong A /(\rho \cap A) = A/\rho_A$$
Now, since $R / \rho$ is $R-$simple, we get that $\rho_A$ is a maximal right ideal of $A$ (?) . Since $\rho$ is regular, there exists some $b \in R$, such that $x - bx \in \rho, \forall x \in R$. Now $A + \rho = R$, hence $b = a + r$, for $a \in A$, and $r \in \rho$. So, we'll have $x - bx = x - (a + r)x = a - ax -rx \in \rho, \forall x \in R$. Since $r \in \rho$, we must have $rx \in \rho$. Hence $x - ax \in \rho, \forall x \in R$, hence $x - ax \in \rho_A, \forall x \in A$, which makes $\rho_A$ $A-$regular. Since $J(A)$ is the intersection of all maximal, regular ideal of $A$, we'll have $J(A) \subset \rho_A$. If $A \subset \rho$, then $\rho_A = A \cap \rho = A$, so obviously $J(A) \subset A =  \rho_A$. Combining the two cases above, we'll have $J(A) \subset \bigcap \rho_A = \left(\bigcap \rho \right) \cap A = J(R) \cap A$. Hence, yielding the desired result. After this theorem, Herstein point out that if $A$ is not two-sided, then the theorem's result will fail. But as far as I can see, there's no place in the theorem that Herstein actually used $A$ as a two-sided ideal of $R$. And there's one thing that I cannot get, it's the (?) part. I know $R / \rho$ is $R-$simple, hence $A / \rho_A$ is also $R-$simple, which means that there is no right ideal of $R$ ( not $A$) lies in between $\rho_A$, and $A$. How come he concluded that $\rho_A$ is a maximal ideal of $A$? Is it where I must use the fact that $A$ is two-sided to prove?

I was asked to show the cardinality of this set but the best I can do right now is the following Monotonically increasing sequences are equivalent to infinite subsets (trivial). Number of finite subsets is countable (by mapping to rational numbers within $[0;1]$ like $\{4,5,6\} \rightarrow 1/2^4+1/2^5+1/2^6$). Number of all subsets is uncountable (by similarly mapping to all numbers within $[0;1]$). Hence the number of infinite subsets is uncountable.

461062,A question on generalization of the concept of derivative,"I am looking for some material to understand the process of generalization of the concept of derivative. I would not like to just read and apply the definition of the concept of differentiation in order to comprehend this generalization. I would like to work with Differential Calculus fluently so please forgive me if this is not a high-level question. What I've read is that for functions $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ it would be equivalent the fact that the limit
$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}
$$
exists and the existence of a (unique) linear map $\lambda:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ (depending on $x_0$) such that
$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)-\lambda(h)}{h} = 0.
$$
Correct me if I'm wrong but only in the case $f:\mathbb R^1 \to \mathbb R^1$ and because of the definition of the function $f'$, it would be $\lambda(h):=h f'(x_0)$. But we use the equivalence with the next equation in order to generalize the concept for $\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R$ (and also $\mathbb R^n\to\mathbb R^m$) functions:
$$
\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)-\lambda(h)}{\lVert h\rVert} = 0\;\: (\in\mathbb R),
$$
which does not depend on the undefined operation of division $\frac{1}{h}$ in $\mathbb R^n$ (why then not requiring the existence of the limit $\lim_{h\to 0}(f(x_0+h)-f(x_0))/{\lVert h\rVert}$?).
Is this correct? Have I committed a lot of inaccuracies? Concluding, what I would like to mean by this question is that I want to understand every step taken in the method of generalization of the concept of derivative.

461082,Rotations around the origin,"The problem is to find the number of rotations around the origin for the function $$f(z)=z^{2013}+2z+1 $$

I tried to solve it with the help of argument principle. $${{N}_{r}}\left( {{z}^{2013}}+2z+1 \right)={{N}_{\left| z \right|<1}}\left( {{z}^{2013}}+2z+1 \right),$$ where ${{N}_{r}}$ - number of rotations around origin, ${{N}_{\left| z \right|<1}}$- number of zeros of ${{z}^{2013}}+2z+1$ in $\left\{ z:\left| z \right|<1 \right\}$.
As ${{z}^{2013}}+2z+1$ is continuous function and ${{z}^{2013}}+2z+1$has no roots on $\left\{ \left| z \right|=1 \right\}$, we can use the theorem of RouchÃ©:
if we take $r=0.999999$ then 
$$|z^{2013}+1|<r^{2013}+1<2r=|2z| ,$$ so, there is only 1 root in $\left\{ z:\left| z \right|<0.999999 \right\}$. But if we take $r=1.001$ and use this theorem again,
$$|2z|<2r<||r|^{2013}-|1||\le|z^{2013}+1|,$$
so, in $\left\{|z|<1.001\right\}$ there are 2013 roots. But how many roots are there in 
$\left\{1<|z|<1.001\right\}$ and $\left\{0.999999<|z|<1\right\}$ -- is unknown. Anything usefull will be appreciated.","['plane-curves', 'complex-analysis']"
461089,Need help understanding this proof of regularity of traveling wave solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation,"These are actually 4 question about a proof given in this paper . Any hint to solutions for any of these questions would be much appreciated! Lemma 1. Assume $v$ is a solution to the equation \begin{equation} ic \partial_1 v + \Delta v + v(1-\vert v \vert^2) =0 \tag{GP} \end{equation} in $L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ of finite energy, then $v$ is regular, bounded and its gradient belongs to all the spaces $W^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for $k \in \mathbb{3}$ and $p \in [2,\infty]$. Here ""finite energy"" means, that \begin{equation} \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\vert \nabla v \vert^2+\frac{1}{4}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}(1-\vert v \vert^2)^2 < \infty. \end{equation} Proof. The authors consider a point $z_0 \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and denote by $\Omega$ the unit ball with center $z_0$. Then the consider the solutions $v_1$ and $v_2$ of \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \Delta v_1=0 & \mbox{on } \Omega  \\ v_1 = v & \mbox{on } \partial \Omega\end{cases} \tag{1} \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \Delta v_2=g(v):=v(1-\vert v\vert^2) + ic \partial_1 v & \mbox{on } \Omega  \\ v_2 = 0 & \mbox{on } \partial \Omega\end{cases} \tag{2} \end{equation} Question 1. It seams odd to consider $v \in L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. A function in this space can not even be a weak solution to (GP), can it? Also equation (1) does not need have a solution if $v$ is only $L^1$, does it? The authors go on and show that $g(v)$ is uniformly bounded in $L^{\frac{4}{3}}(\Omega)$, i.e. $\Vert g(v) \Vert_{L^{\frac{4}{3}}(\Omega)}$ is bounded by a constant not depending on $z_0$. The infer that $v_1$ is unformly bounded in $L^4(\Omega)$ and $v_2$ in $W^{2,\frac{4}{3}}(\Omega)$. I do already understand this part (some elliptic arguments and Sobolev embeddings). But now they denote by $\omega$ the ball with center $z_0$ and radius $\frac{1}{2}$ and tell me to use Cacioppoli inequalities to show that $v_1$ is uniformly bounded on $W^{2,\frac{4}{3}}(\omega)$ and $W^{3,\frac{12}{11}}(\omega)$. This would show that $v$ is uniformly bounded in $W^{2,\frac{4}{3}}(\Omega)$. Question 2. How do you do that? By Caccioppoli inequalities for the Laplace equation I can show that $\Vert Dv_1 \Vert_{L^2(\omega)} \Vert \leq C \Vert v_1 \Vert_{L^2(\omega)}$ but nothing else. How do they do this? Why do they even need the second statement (i.e. $W^{3,\frac{12}{11}}$)? They go on and compute \begin{equation} \nabla g(v) = \nabla v(1-\vert v\vert^2) - 2 (v.\nabla v)v + ic \partial_1 \nabla v \end{equation} which is easy. But from this they infer that $g(v)$ is uniformly bounded in $L^\frac{12}{11}(\omega)$ and finally $v$ is uniformly bounded in $C^{0,\frac{1}{12}}(\omega)$. Question 3. I don't understand any of these steps. For the first one I try to estimate $\int \vert \nabla v - \nabla v \vert v \vert^2 \vert^\frac{12}{11} \leq \int \vert \nabla v \vert^\frac{12}{11} + \int \vert \nabla v \vert^\frac{12}{11} \vert v \vert^\frac{24}{11}$ which I can't manage. For the second one I don't understand why they pick the $\frac{1}{12}$-HÃ¶lder space of all HÃ¶lder spaces. Last but not least they set \begin{equation} h(w)=w(1-\vert v \vert^2) - 2 (v.w)v + \left(\frac{c^2}{2}+2\right)w \end{equation} where $w=\nabla v$ and state that $h(w)$ belongs to $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $w$ to $H^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Question 4. Why is $\nabla v$ even differentiable enough to be plugged in $h$? How do they infer their two results? I have absolutely no idea.

every sequence obtained from $x_n+1 = F(x)$ starting with $x_0\in C$. For $f(x) = 2\pi+x-\arctan(x)$ the domain is all reals and so is the codomain. I don't see another premise that is violated by $f(x)$. Thanks for all the help.","['fixed-point-theorems', 'analysis']"

For $2\times 2$ matrices: $\det \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ c+x & d+y\end{bmatrix}=a(d+y)-b(c+x)=(ad-bc)+(ay-bx)=\det \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\end{bmatrix}+\det \begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ x & y\end{bmatrix}$ Let $
C=\begin{bmatrix} \dots\\ R+S\\ \dots \end{bmatrix}$ be a $n\times n$ matrix for $n\gt 2$, we compute $\det C$ in terms of $\det R$ and $\det S$ where $R = \begin{bmatrix}\dots\\R\\\dots\end{bmatrix}$ and $S = \begin{bmatrix}\dots\\S\\\dots\end{bmatrix}$. Let $i$ denote the index of the rows $R, S, R+S$. $$\det C = \sum_{j\neq i}\pm c_{j1} \det C_{j1} \pm c_{i1} \det C_{i1}$$. By the induction hypothesis, we can write: 
$$\det C = \sum_{j\neq i}\pm c_{j1}(\det R_{j1}+\det S_{j1}) \pm c_{i1}\det C_{i1}$$ We know that $\det C_{i1}=\det R_{i1}=\det S_{i1}$ and $c_{i1}=r_{i1}+s_{i1}$ and $c_{j1}=r_{j1}=s_{j1}$ for $j\neq i$. So 
$$\det C = \sum_{j\neq i}\pm r_{j1}\det R_{j1} + \sum_{j\neq i}\pm s_{j1}\det S_{j1} \pm (r_{i1} + s_{i1})\det C_{i1}=
\sum_{j\neq i}\pm r_{j1}\det R_{j1} + \sum_{j\neq i}\pm s_{j1}\det S_{j1} \pm ( r_{i1}\det C_{i1} + s_{i1}\det C_{i1})=

\sum_{j}\pm r_{j1}\det R_{j1} + \sum_{j}\pm s_{j1}\det S_{j1}=\det R + \det S$$. A simular induction argument shows that $$\det \begin{bmatrix}\dots \\ c\times R \\ \dots\end{bmatrix}=

461250,proof of the chain rule for calculus,"I was comparing my attempt to prove the chain rule by my own and the proof given in Spivak's book but they seems to be rather different. Please tell me if I'm wrong or if I'm missing something. I really appreciate any comment. Thank you so much. Theorem: Let $I$ and $J$ be open intervals in $\mathbb{R}$. Let $a\in I$ and let $f:I\longrightarrow J$ and $g:J\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ functions. Suppose that $f$ is differentiable at $a$, and that $g$ is differentiable at $f(a)$. Then $g\circ f$ is differentiable at $a$ and $(g\circ f)'(a)=g'(f(a))f'(a)$ Idea and observations: We wanted to find $\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(g\circ f)(a+h)-g\circ f(a)}{h}= \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))}{h}$, which seems to be the same as $\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))}{f(a+h)-f(a)}\cdot \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=g'(f(a))\cdot f'(a)$. The problem here, as Spivak suggests is that $f(a+h)$ may be equals $f(a)$ for some values of $h$ and then the division might not be defined for such values. In this case Spivak defines a new function $\phi$ such that $\phi(h)=\frac{g(f(a+h))-f(a)}{f(a+h)-f(a)}$ if  $f(a+h)\neq f(a)$ and $f'(g(a))$ otherwise. Then he proves that $\phi$ is continuous by using $\epsilon - \delta$ definitions and since $\frac{(g\circ f)(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=\phi(h)\cdot \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$, the result follows. Here my approach is rather different by using the fact that if $\lim_{x\to a }f=b$ and $\lim_{x\to b} g=l$ then $\lim_{x\to a}g\circ f=l$ (This implies at the same time that $f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=\lim_{h\to a}\frac{f(h)-f(a)}{h-a}$). Proof: Since $f$ is diferentiable at $a$ then $f$ is continuous at $a$. Then $\lim_{h\to a}f(h)=f(a)$. Since  $\lim_{h\to 0}(a+h)=a$ then, $1)$ $\lim_{h\to 0}f(a+h)=f(a)$. Now, by hypothesis, $2)$ $ \lim_{h\to f(a)}\frac{g(h)-g(f(a))}{h-f(a)}=g'(f(a))$, and $3)$ $\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=f'(a)$ therefore, from $1)$ and $2)$ $\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))}{f(a+h)-f(a)}=g'(f(a))$. Finally, $(g\circ f)'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g\circ f(a)}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))}{h}=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(f(a+h))-g(f(a))}{f(a+h)-f(a)}\cdot \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}=g'(f(a))\cdot f'(a)$.","['calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Most of things he did in a very general context (families of vector spaces indexed by some arbitry set of indexes and with dimensions being finite or infinite). I'm looking for a good advanced book on linear algebra to review what he did in class, but the books he recommend do not go so far if I'm right.

461400,Compactness of Algebraic Curves over $\mathbb C^2$,"I was reading through Kirwan's Complex Algebraic Curves and I've been stuck on the following exercise: Given a (non-constant) polynomial $P(x,y)$, show that the curve in $\mathbb C^2$ defined by $P(x,y)=0$ is not compact. My attempt at a solution: If we can show that there are only finitely many $a\in \mathbb C$ such that there is no $b \in C$ with $P(a,b)=0$, I think we're done. Once we've shown this, we can consider any sequence of complex numbers $x_n$ with $|x|=n$. For all but finitely many $x_n$, there is then some $y_n$ with $P(x_n,y_n)=0$. This implies then that the curve defined by $P$ isn't bounded, and thus is not compact. I'm unsure as to my proof of this step though, and would love some input on my sketch. Fix $a_0$, and assume $P(a_0,y)$, viewed as a polynomial in $\mathbb C[y]$, has no roots. Clearly then $P(a_0,y)=c_0$ for some $c_0 \in \mathbb C$. Then $a_0$ is a root of $P(x,y)-c_0$, so we can write $P(x,y)-c_0=(x-a_0)\cdot f_0(x,y)$ for some polynomial $f_0(x,y)$. Now, fix $a_1$ distinct from $a_0$ and assume $P(a_1,y)$ is some constant $c_1$. Then $P(a_1,y)=c_1$, so $P(a_1,y)-c_0=c_1-c_0$ and then $(a_1-a_0)\cdot f_0(a_1,y)=c_1-c_0$. Thus $a_1$ is a root of $f_0(x,y)-\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}$, so we can write $f_0(x,y)-\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}=(x-a_1)\cdot f_1(x,y)$, for some polymomial $f_1$ of degree strictly less than $f_0$, and thus $P(x,y)=(x-a_0)(x-a_1)f_1(x,y)+(x-a_1)\frac{c_1-c_0}{a_1-a_0}+c_0$. If we continue in this fashion, we obtain a sequence of polynomials $f_i$ of strictly decreasing degree. This must terminate in finitely many steps, so there can only be finitely many distinct $a_i$. Does this look like the right idea? I feel like I'm probably over-complicating this step, so if anyone has  a more elegant solution I'd love to hear it!","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves']"

Chapter 12 includes a number of exercises asking the student to prove that something is an equivalence relation and to describe the associated partition.  For example:  In $\mathbb{Q}$, $r \sim s$ iff $r - s \in \mathbb{Z}$. I think I'm okay with most (?) of this.  I'd show this is an equivalence relation like so:  If $x, y, z \in \mathbb{Q}$, then $x - x = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim x$.  Second, if $x \sim y$, then $y - x = -(x - y) \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim y \implies y \sim x$. Finally, if $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$, then $x - z = (x - y) - (z - y) \in \mathbb{Z}$, and so $x \sim z$. The two parts I'm not sure about:  First, that last f on the iff .  Essentially, this means I have to prove that if $r \sim s$, then their difference is an integer, right?  But I thought this is merely how this particular equivalence relation is defined.  How do I know that $r \sim s$ until I look at their difference? Second, I have a basic idea of what the partition is, but I'm not sure how to form the statement.  The equivalence class $[q] = \{k + q : k \in \mathbb{Z}, q \in \mathbb{Q} \}$.  But if anything, that seems as though it would be the definition for a single equivalence class, not the description of the partition.

461657,Geometrical interpretation of a group action of $SU_2$ on $\mathbb S^3$,"Background There're some nomenclatures from Michael Artin's Algebra to explain. 3-Sphere, or $\mathbb S^3$, is the locus of $x_0^2+x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=1$, where $(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)\in\mathbb R^4$. $SU_2$ is a special unitary group, i.e, the group of complex $2\times 2$ matrices of the form
\begin{bmatrix}
a&b\\
-\bar b&\bar a
\end{bmatrix}
with $\bar aa+\bar bb=1$. Rewrite $a=x_0+x_1i,b=x_2+x_3i$, there's an obvious 1-1 correspondence of $SU_2$ with $\mathbb S^3$, therefore when we say matrix $A$ is on $\mathbb S^3$, we actually mean that $A\in SU_2$. Some similar terminologies apply for the subsets of $\mathbb S^3$, as well. Latitudes of $\mathbb S^3$ are the loci of $x_0=c$, where $-1<c<1$. When $c=0$, it's so-called the equator $\mathbb E$. They are 2-spheres. Longitudes of $\mathbb S^3$ are the intersections of 2D subspaces of $\mathbb R^2$ (which contains $0$) and $\mathbb S^3$. They are circles. Question In Algebra , there's a group action of $SU_2$ on $\mathbb S^3$: conjugation, namely, $\gamma_P\colon\mathbb S^3\to\mathbb S^3;U\mapsto PUP^*$, where $P^*=\bar P^t$, the transpose of the complex conjugation. It's not hard to show that the same operation acts on the equator $\mathbb E$, too. The effect of this action is rotation. Suppose that $P=\cos\theta I+\sin\theta A$ where $A\in\mathbb E$, viz. $\operatorname{tr}A=0$, $\gamma_P$ is a $2\theta$-spin around the axis $A$. It's not obvious. Now I want to consider another group action, which might be used to interpret the preceding group action: act by left-multiplication (when the left-multiplication is interpreted, the right-multiplication might follow from some slight modifications). Suppose $P\in SU_2$, $A\mapsto PA$ is another natural group action. It's not hard to show that the longitudes of $\mathbb S^3$ are conjugate subgroups of $SU_2$, therefore if $A,P$ lie on the same longitude, so does $PA$, and the group action is apparent, just like the multiplication on the circle $\mathbb S^1$. However, I don't know the geometrical interpretation for the whole action on the whole set. Precisely, my question is: How can we interpret the group action of left-multiplication of $SU_2$ on $\mathbb S^3$ geometrically, which is highly related to the geometrical facts on $\mathbb R^4$ and $\mathbb E$ as a subset of $\mathbb R^3$, so that we can more clearly see the reason that group actions by conjugation are just rotations in $\mathbb E\subset\mathbb R^3$? Edit It's natural to correspond the inner product $x_0y_0+x_1y_1+x_2y_2+x_3y_3$ in the matrix form. Suppose that $P,Q$ are the corresponding matrices of $(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)$ and $(y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3)$, it's not hard to check that $\operatorname{tr}(P^*Q)/2$ is the required expression, therefore it's easy to see that left-multiplication is orthogonal operator on $\mathbb S^3\subset\mathbb R^4$. $\mathbb S^3$ is also related to quaternions of length $1$. In fact, these groups are isomorphic.","['geometry', 'intuition', 'reference-request', 'group-theory', 'linear-groups']"

In Arabic, al- is the definite article ""the."" The first noun in the
title is jebr ""reunion of broken parts,"" from the verb jabara ""to
reunite, to consolidate."" The second noun is from the verb qabala,
with meanings that include ""to place in front of, to balance, to
oppose, to set equal."" Together the two nouns describe some of the
manipulations so common in algebra: combining like terms, transposing
a term to the opposite side of an equation, setting two quantities
equal, etc. Because the original Arabic title was so long, and because
it was in Arabic, Europeans soon shortened it. The result was algeber
or something phonetically similar, which then took on the meanings of
both nouns and eventually acquired its modern sense...","['linear-algebra', 'math-history', 'terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"

$\frac{-1}{1}=\frac{1}{-1}$, then take the square root of both sides:

\frac{\sqrt{-1}}{\sqrt{1}}=\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{-1}}
$$
hence
$$
\frac{i}{1} = \frac{1}{i} \\

Where was the problem exactly? Was is that we can not convert $\sqrt{1/-1}$ to $\sqrt{1}/\sqrt{-1}$? both the RHS and LHS are unordered sets? both? Question 2: Also, does this problem only arise in equalities or in general algebraic manipulation? Because it would be a nightmare when manipulating an expression with fractional powers! Are there easy rules to determine what is safe to do with fractional powers? To see what I mean, there is another example of a similar trap: One might easily think that $\sqrt[4]{16x^2y^7}$ is equivalent to $2x^{1/2}y^{7/4}$, which is not true for $x=-1$ and $y=1$.","['arithmetic', 'algebra-precalculus', 'fake-proofs']"

An exercise in Jean-FranÃ§ois Mertens, Sylvain Sorin and Shmuel Zamir(2000) (page 13) is to show that if $X$ is compact, then $\Delta(X)$ is compact. I know that ""if"" in this assertion can be replaced by iff. That's because that  $\mu \mapsto \mu(f)= \int f d\mu$ is u.s.c for all bounded u.s.c $f$ is equivalent to that $\mu \mapsto \mu(f)= \int f d\mu$ is continuous for all bounded continuous $f$ as shown in this note (proposition 1.12, page 6). $\Delta(X)$ equipped with the latter topology is compact, iff $X$ is compact (Theorem 6.4, page 45, K.R.

Question: Isn't it the case that proposition $a$ which is asked to be proved followed from the definition of $M(X)$? If there is no $\mu$ for some $p$, then $p$ must be in $M(X)$, right?

461762,Alternative combinatorial proof for $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m+r}{n}=\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m}{r}2^r$,"I have a question with regards to combinatorics. I am supposed to show the following combinatorial identity: $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m+r}{n}=\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m}{r}2^r$. The algebraic way is to consider the coefficient of $t^m$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$. For $r\in\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$, we have the coefficient of $t^{n-r}$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n$ to be equal to $\binom{n}{r}$, and the coefficient of $t^{m+r-n}$ in the expansion of $(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$ to be equal to $\binom{m+r}{n}$. By the addition and multiplication principles this will show that the coefficient of $t^m$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$ will be equal to $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m+r}{n}$. On the other hand, we note that $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}=(1+\frac{2t}{1-t})^n(1-t)^{-1}=\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}2^rt^r(1-t)^{-(r+1)}$. As the coefficient of $t^{m-r}$ is equal to $\binom{m}{r}$, this implies that the coefficient of $t^m$ in the expansion of $(1+t)^n(1-t)^{-(n+1)}$ is equal to $\sum\limits_{r=0}^n\binom{n}{r}\binom{m}{r}2^r$. What I am thinking of, is to think of a way to prove this identity without the use of the generalized binomial series. I was trying to think of a combinatorial method to solve this problem. In particular, I was trying to prove the combinatorial identity as follows: Firstly, let us be given a class of $n$ boys and a class of $m$ girls, where $n\leq m$. Choose a team $A$ of $r$ boys, and choose a team $B$ of $r$ girls, and finally choose any subset (may be empty) of boys from $A$ to clean the classroom, where $r\in\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$. For each value of $r$, we see that there are $\binom{n}{r}$ choices for $A$, $\binom{m}{r}$ choices for $B$, and subsequently there are $2^r$ ways to choose a subset from $A$. In this way we get the number of ways to do so to be equal to the expression on the RHS of the identity. What I am struggling though, is to be able to count the number of desired ways in a way that will give me the expression on the LHS of the identity. I tried firstly to choose the boys to clean the classroom before choosing the sets $A$ and $B$, but I wound up with some messy expression that does not seem close to matching the expression on the LHS. I would like to know if there is another way of looking at this method (or I could have been missing out on something), or if there is any other combinatorial method (or any other algebraic method that does not involve the use of generalized binomial series) that one could think of to show the desired identity.","['summation', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
