4299234,Two quite messy sequences,Consider the following $50-$ term sums $:$ $$ S=\frac{1}{1\cdot2}+\frac{1}{3\cdot4}+\frac{1}{5\cdot6}+....\frac{1}{99\cdot100}$$ and $$T=\frac{1}{51\cdot100}+\frac{1}{52\cdot99}+\frac{1}{53\cdot98}+....+\frac{1}{100\cdot51}$$ Express $\frac{S}{T}$ as an irreducible fraction. My attempt $:$ The first equation can be written as $$S=\frac11-\frac12+\frac13-\frac14+\frac15-\frac16+....+\frac1{99}-\frac1{100}$$ $\implies$ $$S=(1+\frac13+\frac15+....+\frac1{99})-(\frac12+\frac14+\frac16+....+\frac1{100})$$ or $$S=1+\frac12\operatorname{ln}50-\frac12\operatorname{ln}\frac{103}{2}$$ and $$T=2(\frac{1}{51\cdot100}+\frac{1}{52\cdot99}+\frac{1}{53\cdot98}+....+\frac{1}{75\cdot76})$$ After this I am not able to do anything. And also the value of S which I get doesn't seems to be correct(though I have calculated it using formula)as it is quite messy and I don't think S can be further reduced.

4299293,Prove that E is reflexive.,"QUESTION: Let $E$ be a Banach space where $E'$ is the dual space of $E$ . Assume the $E'$ is separable and suppose that for all neighborhood $V$ of $\sigma(E', E'')$ is there exists a neighborhood of $W\in \sigma(E', E)$ such that $W\subset V$ . Show that $E$ is reflexive. MY ATTEMPT: We have that $E$ is also separable, because $E$ is a Banach space, and $E'$ is separable. Therefore, to show that $E$ is reflexive, we only need to show that $E'$ is reflexive (by another theorem). Now, by Kakutani's theorem, it is enough show that the closure of $B_{E'}$ (the unit ball in $E'$ ) is compact in $\sigma(E', E'')$ . Let $\{V_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda\in \Gamma}$ be an open cover of the ball $\overline{B_{E'}}$ . On the other hand, by Banach-Alaogly-Bourbaki's theorem, $\overline{B_{E'}}$ is compact in $\sigma(E', E)$ . Now, from the statement we can infer that $\{W_{\lambda}\}_{\lambda \in \Gamma}$ is another an open cover of $\overline{B_{E'}}$ , then is there exists $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\overline{B_{E'}}\subset \displaystyle\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}W_{\lambda_k}$ . And because $W_{\lambda_k}\subset V_{\lambda_k}$ (I'm not very sure in how to explain this). Thus, $\overline{B_{E'}}\subset \displaystyle\bigcup_{k=1}^{n}V_{\lambda_k}$ . Therefore $\overline{B_{E'}}$ is compact in $\sigma(E, E'')$ , then by Kakutani's theorem this implies that $E'$ is reflexive, which implies (by other result) that $E$ is itself reflexive. DOUBT: Well, I do not feel that every step above is right. I mean I would like to give more explanations, to provide another proof more step by step. Would you help me with this, please? Thanks in advance. P.S.: I thought maybe it is possible to use Eberlein-Smulian theorem's too. Other idea, using @David Mitra MY SECOND ATTEMPT: Because $E'$ is separable then is there exists a sequence $(x_n)\in E$ such that $\|x_n\|=1$ , $\forall \; n$ and holds that $x_n\rightharpoonup 0$ weakly. (I've proved this using that $E'$ is separable (by definition is there exist a subset $D$ which is contable and dense in $E'$ .)). At the end I've used this result to prove that $\|f_n-f\|\leq \epsilon$ for every $f, f_n\in D$ , $\forall \epsilon>0$ . Thus forall $k>n$ we have that $\|f(x_k)-0\|\longrightarrow 0$ as $m\rightarrow +\infty$ . Therefore, $x_k\rightharpoonup$ weakly. Then, there is $M>0$ , such that $\|x_k\|\leq M$ , i.e., $(x_k)$ is bounded. Hence, by the Eberlein-Smulian theorem this implies that $E$ is reflexive.","['functional-analysis', 'weak-topology']"
4299306,$f \in L^p \iff$ a certain series converges,"Let $E_n = \{x \in \mathbb{X} \mid (n-1) \leq |f(x)| < n\}$ , where $(\mathbb{X}, \mathcal{A}, \mu)$ is a finite measure space (i.e., $\mu(\mathbb{X}) < \infty$ ) and $f$ is a measurable function. Prove that $f \in L^p \iff \sum n^p \mu(E_n) < \infty$ . One of the implications is very straightforward to me. It is clear that $\mathbb{X} = \bigcup E_n$ , where the union is disjoint. Therefore, we have: $$\int_\mathbb{X} |f|^p d\mu = \sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_{E_n} |f|^p d\mu$$ By the definition of the sets, we get the inequalities: $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int (n-1)^p \mathbb{1}_{E_n} d\mu \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty\int_{E_n} |f|^p d\mu < \sum_{n=1}^\infty \int n^p \mathbb{1}_{E_n} d\mu$$ These, in turn, simplify to $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty (n-1)^p \mu(E_n) \leq \int_{\mathbb{X}} |f|^p d\mu < \sum_{n=1}^\infty  n^p \mu(E_n)$$ Thus, it is immediately apparent that, if the sum converges, then so does the integral, which implies $f \in L^p$ . My problem is in the other implication: $f \in L^p$ implies convergence I haven't used finite measure yet, so maybe it comes to play. I first thought about expanding $(n-1)^p$ , but this would be a mess even if $p$ was an integer (unless in the case where $p = 1$ , in which finite measure would imply the result easily). Does anyone have a hint as per how to proceed? Thanks in advance!","['measure-theory', 'lp-spaces', 'sequences-and-series']"

4299409,Limit of multivariare function at the origin,"Consider the function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}$ defined as: $$

If the limit exists it has to be $0$ since, for example, if we take the restriction $x=y$ we obtain: $$

4299411,Can you prove that $\Bbb R$ is uncountable using the Lebesgue measure?,"I have been studying measure theory from the ground up, and am quite excited by the seeming power it holds. I thought of this last evening, and I wish to ask if the following proof of uncountability is fully rigorous: Note: In the lecture notes I have been reading, to develop the measure-theoretic tools I use in this proof, the uncountability of $\Bbb R$ was not used, so I believe this avoids circular reasoning. Any countable subset $Q$ of $\Bbb R$ admits an enumeration of points $\{q_n:n\in\Bbb N\}$ , i.e. that $x\in Q\iff\exists n\in\Bbb N:q_n=x$ , and $q_n=q_m\iff n=m$ , by definition of countability. The Lebesgue outer measure $\mu^*$ is defined as the infimum of the volume of countable rectangular covers of that set; taking some arbitrary $\varepsilon\gt0$ , one can construct the cover of ""rectangles"" $R_n=[q_n-\varepsilon\cdot2^{-(1+n)},q_n+\varepsilon\cdot2^{-(1+n)}]$ . By construction, $\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}R_n\supseteq Q$ , and $\sum_{n\in\Bbb N}\mu(R_n)=\varepsilon$ from the geometric series. The outer measure is defined with the infimum of covers, so $\mu^*(Q)\le\varepsilon$ as $\{R_n\}$ is a valid countable cover of $Q$ . It follows from $\varepsilon$ as arbitrary that $\mu^*(Q)=0$ , and also that $\mu(Q)=0$ - null sets w.r.t the outer measure are Lebesgue measurable. Now take any non-trivial closed interval $[a,b]$ in $\Bbb R$ ; as it is a ""rectangle"", it has Lebesgue measure $|b-a|\neq0$ , (by definition of the outer measure, right?) Thus any closed interval in $\Bbb R$ cannot be countable, as otherwise it would have null measure (furthermore it cannot be reached as a countable limit of countable sets, since the measure is $\sigma$ -additive and the set would still have $0$ measure). Thus the reals are uncountable, and this argument generalises easily to $\Bbb R^n,\Bbb C^n$ . Is this rigorously sufficient as a proof? It feels like cheating somehow, but I can't place my finger on why I feel that, and I certainly can't see any mistakes or circular reasoning.","['real-numbers', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'set-theory']"

4299421,Polar sets and weak star topology,"I have to prove the following: Let X a real normed space, and I a non-empty index set. Let $ \{ x_{i}, i \in I \}$ $\subset$ X , $\{  \alpha_{i},\ i \in I \}$ a set of positive real numbers.
Define $ S:= \{x^{*} \in X^{*}, ||{x^{*}}|| \leq R \ and \ |x^{*}(x_{i})| \leq \alpha_{i}, \forall i \in I \} $ . Show that $\forall \  x_{0} \in X$ , the set $ \{x^{*}(x_{0}), \ x^{*} \in S \} $ is a bounded closed interval in the real line. My claim was the following: $ \forall i \in I $ , let $ x_{i}^{\circ} = \{x^{*} \in X^{*}, \ such \ that \ |x^{*}(x_{i})| \leq 1 \}$ the polar of $x_{i}$ . Then we know that $\alpha_{i} x_{i}^{\circ} = (x_{i}/\alpha_{i})^{\circ}$ . Now we can characterize $S= B_{R}^{\star} \  \cap \ \cap_{i \in I} (x_{i}/\alpha_{i})^{\circ}$ . Thus S is $wk^{\star}$ compact because $B_{R}^{\star}$ is $wk^{\star}$ compact  (Banach-Alaoglu Theorem) and $\cap_{i \in I} (x_{i}/\alpha_{i})^{\circ} = (\cup_{i \in I} (x_{i}/\alpha_{i}))^{\circ}$ which is $wk^{\star}$ closed because polars are. Thus if we take the evaluation map $\phi_{x_{0}}:S \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\phi_{x_{0}}(x^{*})=x^{*}(x_{0})$ , this is a continuous map from a compact set so its image must be compact, therefore it is bounded and closed.

4299428,A characterization of positive definite conditional covariance matrices,"Let $X=[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ be an $n\times 1$ vector of square integrable real random variables on a probability space, and let $\mathcal F$ be a sub- $\sigma$ -algebra. Consider the following conditional covariance matrix: $$\Sigma_\mathcal F:=E[XX'|\mathcal F]$$ This matrix is positive semi-definite a.s. (see here ). Am wondering if the following result is true: Proposition. $\Sigma_\mathcal F$ fails to positive definite a.s. if and only if there exists $\mathcal F$ -measurable random variables $W_1,\dots,W_n$ , not all zeros a.s., such that $W_1X_1+\dots +W_nX_n=0$ a.s.. One direction is not too hard. Suppose $W$ is an $n\times 1$ $\mathcal F$ measurable vector such that $W^\top X=0$ a.s.. Then, from the linearity and pull-out property of conditional expectations, $$0=E[(W^\top X)^2 |\mathcal F]=E[W^\top XX^\top W |\mathcal F]=W^\top \Sigma_\mathcal F W \quad \quad (1)$$ almost surely. So if $A$ is an event of positive probability on which $W\neq 0$ , then $\Sigma_\mathcal F $ fails to be positive definite for almost all $\omega \in A$ . The other direction seems more tricky. Let $A$ be the event that $\Sigma_\mathcal F$ is symmetric positive semi-definite, but not positive definite. Note that $A$ is the intersection of the following three sets $$\bigcap_{i\neq j}\{\Sigma^{ij}_\mathcal F=\Sigma^{ji}_\mathcal F\}, \quad \bigcap_{a \in \mathbf{Q}^n} \{a^\top\Sigma _\mathcal Fa\geq 0\},\quad \{\det(\Sigma _\mathcal F)= 0\} $$ and so is $\mathcal F$ -measurable. If $P(A)>0$ , then for each $\omega \in A$ we can find a nonzero vector $a(\omega)$ statisfying $$a(\omega)^\top\Sigma _\mathcal F (\omega) a(\omega)=0$$ and the idea is to define $W(\omega):=a(\omega)$ if $\omega \in A$ and $W(\omega):=0$ otherwise. Assuming $W$ is $\mathcal F$ -measurable, then the same calculation as in $(1)$ shows that $W^\top X=0$ a.s.. But how can I ensure $\mathcal F$ -measurability of $W$ ?

My attempt: The LHS denotes the number of $r$ permutations of a $n+1$ element set. $P_r^{n+1}=\binom{n+1}rr!$ so we can view that as the total number of total orderings on $r$ element subsets of an $n+1$ element set. On the RHS, $r!=r(r-1)!=r\binom{r-1}{r-1}(r-1)!=rP_{r-1}^{r-1}$ , so we can rewrite the RHS as: $$\begin{aligned}r!+(P_{r-1}^n+P_{r-1}^{n-1}+\cdots P_{r-1}^r)&=r\sum_{k=r-1}^nP_{r-1}^k\\&=r\sum_{k=r-1}^n \binom{k}{r-1}(r-1)!\\&=r!\sum_{k=r-1}^n\binom{k}{r-1}\end{aligned}.$$ Now, $\binom{k}{r-1}$ can represent the number of ways to choose a subset of $r$ elements of a set $\{1,2,\ldots,n+1\}$ with the greatest element $k+1$ . Hence, $\sum_{k=r-1}^n\binom{k}{r-1}=\binom{n+1}r$ .

4299684,determining the cubic function from a graph,"This question may be a bit below the regular level for this forum, but I really struggle finding the solution. All of my attempts seem to end up describing $y = 1$ , probably because all the points I can read from the graph are on that line. While this was given as a homework assignment, it wasn't to me, and I have been struggling with it for days now, since I was asked to help. The deadline has long passed. I have, in the meantime, studied several of my old text books, to no avail. The question, as stated, was: given the graph below, determine the cubic function expression on the form $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ . Note that the graph crosses $(0,1)$ , has a local maximum at $x=1$ and minimum at $x=3$ , and satisfies $f(3)=1$ . This corresponds to $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$ and $f''(x) = 6ax + 2b$ .  I know that the $a$ value must be positive, given the graph. I have determined visually that $f(0) = 1$ , $f(3) = 1$ , $f'(1) = 0$ , $f'(3) = 0$ , $f''(2) = 0$ .
The exact values of the root or the value at $f(1)$ are impossible to tell. This gives me this set of equations: $$d = f(0) = 1 \tag{1}$$ $$f(3) = 1 \Rightarrow 27a + 9b + 3c + 1 = 1 \Rightarrow 27a + 9b + 3c = 0 \tag{2}$$ $$f'(1) = 0 \Rightarrow 3a + 2b + c = 0 \Rightarrow c=-3a-2b\tag{3}$$ $$f'(3) = 0 \Rightarrow 27a + 6b + c = 0 \tag{4}$$ $$f''(2) = 0 \Rightarrow 12a + 2b = 0 \Rightarrow b = -6a \tag{5}$$ Substituting $(3)$ and $(5)$ into $(2)$ gives me: $$27a + 9(-6a) + 3(-3a-2(-6a)) = 0 \Rightarrow 27a - 54a + 27a = 0\Rightarrow 0=0\tag{6}$$ I get a similar result if I substitute into $(4)$ : $$27a + 6(-6a) + (-3a -2(-6a)) = 0 \Rightarrow 27a-36a-3a+12a = 0\Rightarrow0=0\tag{7}$$ But $(6)$ and $(7)$ are useless. I realize that all of the points I'm using are on $y = 1$ and the derivatives hold true for that line, too. Given that the graph isn't precise enough to actually read the values from either the root or the value of the local maximum - how do I proceed here to find the value of $a$ ?

4299741,Silly question: is there any homotopy version of the residue theorem?,"Many textbooks contain statements and proofs of the Jordan curve version, the homology version or the homotopy version of Cauchy's integral formula. In the first two cases, corresponding versions of the residue theorem are often also prsented, but apparently, no textbook states the residue theorem in terms of homotopy. If my impression is correct, why are homology or Jordan curve relevant to both theorems but homotopy is relevant only to one of them? What is the decisive difference between homotopy and the other two notions? Background. Earlier this year, I was trying to re-learn complex analysis at undergraduate level from Cartan's Elementary Theory of Analytic Functions of One or Several Complex Variables . In his book, two versions of Cauchy's integral formula are presented. The first one, a homotopic form, is based on a notion of ""primitive of a differential $1$ -form along a homotopy"". Its development and proof are very elegant. The assumptions in the theorem statement are amazingly weak: the closed curves are only required to be continuous ; they are not required to be rectifiable or piecewise $C^1$ . Just as I was exclaiming in delight about the elegance of this homotopic form, Cartan presented an ""alternative form of Cauchy's integral formula"" in §2.II.8, theorem 5 (p.74): Let $\Gamma$ be the oriented boundary of a compact subset $K$ of an open set $D$ and let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function in $D$ . Then, $$
\int_\Gamma f(z)dz=0;
$$ if, moreover, $a$ is an interior point of $K$ , then $$
\int_\Gamma \frac{f(z)dz}{z-a}=2\pi i f(a).
$$ To my dismay, the proof of this alternative form relied on completely different machineries. In particular, the proof ultimately relied on the implicit function theorem as well as Green's theorem. The application of the former is so weird (at least to a non-expert like me) that I needed to ask a question on this site to understand what was going on, and the latter was stated without proof. Thus it seemed to me that the proof of this alternative form (or the book) wasn't self contained. Worse still, not only had Cartan not explained any relationship between the two versions of Cauchy's integral formula, but his proof of the residue theorem also relied on this alternative form rather than the homotopical one. At this point, I realized that I had never seen any textbook on complex analysis that presented a homotopical version of the residue theorem, and I wondered why.","['complex-analysis', 'homotopy-theory', 'soft-question', 'residue-calculus']"

4299803,Would this method of mathematical induction still be correct?,"Problem: Prove that $n^2-1$ is divisible by $8$ whenever $n$ is an odd positive integer. Now according to many different solutions, the key is to rewrite the statement so that it applies to all positive integers and solve in two cases, one where n is odd and one where n is even. Is is possible to solve it by, instead of proving $k+1$ , you prove $k+2$ , since $k$ is an odd, positive integer, and that implies that $k+2$ is the next odd, positive integer? When you solve for $k+2$ , it would go along the lines of (skipping over the base case of $n=1$ ): The inductive hypothesis would be that $k^2-1$ is divisible by $8$ . We plug in $k+2$ into $n^2-1$ and get $k^2+4k+4-1$ Rearrange to $(k^2-1) + 4(k+1)$ Now since $k$ is an odd, positive integer, $k+1$ must be an even positive integer. This means we can rewrite $k+1$ as $2m$ , where $m$ is any positive integer. Now, we have $(k^2-1) + 4(2m)$ Distribute to get $(k^2-1) + 8m$ . Using the result that for any integer $a$ , where $a\neq0$ , if $b$ is divisible by $a$ , and $c$ is divisible by $a$ , then $mb + nc$ is divisible by $a$ whenever $m,n$ are integers and the inductive hypothesis that $k^2-1$ is divisible by 8, this proves that for any positive odd integer, $n^2-1$ will be divisible by $8$ . TL;DR or the overall question: In the proof by mathematical induction, does $k+1$ have to be strictly $k+1$ with no alternative, or does it simply mean ""the next element"" when trying to prove that $P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$","['induction', 'solution-verification', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4299807,Convergence in distribution of the sample geometric mean for positive random variables,"I am stumped on the current problem regarding asymptotic distributions of random variables. Suppose that $X_n$ are positive, iid random variables with finite mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$ . Let $P_n=(\prod_{k=1}^{n}X_k)^{1/n}$ and let $Z_n=\frac{P_n - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ for $n \geq 1$ . Find the limit of $Z_n$ in distribution as $n \to \infty$ . Thus far, what I have noticed is that $\log P_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\log(X_k)=\overline{\log(X_n)}$ , so one could apply the Delta Method to $\frac{\overline{\log(X_n)}-E(\log (X_1))}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ as this will converge to a normal distribution by the CLT. However, in the problem statement we have $\mu$ and not $e^{E(\log (X_1))}$ , so I would not be sure on how to proceed. On top of that, we may not even know whether $E(\log (X_1))$ is finite or not. What would be some hints on how to proceed? I think it would be more straight forward if the $X_n$ followed a particular distribution, but in this case it is completely arbitrary (just that they are positive and have finite mean and variance).","['statistics', 'central-limit-theorem', 'weak-convergence', 'probability-distributions', 'probability-theory']"

Some ""non-trivial"" behaviour can happen: for example, if $w = aba^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}$ then we find the product $$aba^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1} \cdot aba^{-1} \cdot ab = aba^{-1}b,$$ i.e. the word $aba^{-1}b$ is a product of three prefixes, but is not graphically a product of prefixes, of $w$ . I don't see how this kind of cancellation could ever be enough to completely cancel such a product, however. An equivalent formulation of the question is: let $X_w$ be the subsemigroup of a free group $F_A$ generated by the set of non-empty prefixes of a word $w \in F_A$ .

I am new to coding theory so I am having some troubles with this particular question... If it corrects $1$ mistakes, that means that $d>2\cdot1$ (I believe this is a well-known result [I prove it at my courses]), where $d$ is the minimal distance of the code $\mathcal{C}$ defined as $d=d(\mathcal{C})=\min\{d(x,y)|x,y\in \mathcal{C},x\neq y\}$ , and that distance in the definition is the Hamming distance defined as $d(x,y)=\#\{i|1\leq i\leq n,x_{i}\neq y_{i}\}$ , being $x=(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ and $y=(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{n})$ elements in $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$ (where $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is the alphabet of the code, and $n$ denotes the length of the words). So, in my particular case I want that the minimal distance of the code is greater than $2$ , i.e., I want that there are no two different words in the code that have Hamming distance equal or lesser than $2$ , i.e., no two words in the code that have more than $4$ coordinates equal to each other (as If they have four equal to each other, there would be $6-4=2$ different to each other, so the Hamming distance would be $2$ , and if there are $5$ equal to each other, the Hamming distance would be $1$ which is not valid). So, I begin to construct the code, by taking the first word: $$
	(1,1,1,1,1,1)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6}
	$$ Then, I could take another one like: $$
	(1,1,1,0,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6}
	$$ which satisfies the previous conditions. So, taking this kind of words, and taking on account the conditions that must hold, I could keep going with this ''constructive algorithm'' until I have $5$ words. For example: $$
	(1,0,0,1,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6}

	(0,1,0,1,1,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6}

	(0,0,0,0,0,0)\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{6}

Find, with proof, a formula for the determinant of $D_n$ . For instance, the matrix $A_n$ for $n=4$ is shown below. $$A_4 =\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 3 & 2 \\

6,&\text{ if $n\equiv 2\bmod 6$}\\

12, &\text{ if $n\equiv 4 $ or $5\bmod 6$}\\
0,&\text{ otherwise}\end{cases}.$$ One can define $D_0 := 1$ . I know $D_2 = 7$ and using row operations. So far, I've come up with the following sequence of operations, but I seem to be stuck after the last step. In the description below, $R_i$ represents the $i$ th row and $C_i$ represents the ith column of $A_n$ . Suppose $n > 2$ . Perform the operation $R_i \mapsto R_i - R_n$ for $2\leq i < n.$ Then the resulting matrix has all zeroes for entries of the form $(i, j)$ for $i < j$ that are not on the last row. The entries on the last row are $n-1$ $2$ 's followed by a $3$ . Also, entries along the main diagonal are all $1$ 's and the only entry of the form $(i,i+1)$ where $2\leq i <n$ that does not equal $-1$ is $(n-1,n)$ , and that entry equals $-2$ . Entries of the form $(i,i+2)$ where $2\leq i < n-2$ are equal to one while entry $(n-2,n)$ equals $0$ if it exists. Now perform the operations $C_i \mapsto C_i - C_1$ for $2\leq i < n$ . This removes all the $2$ 's on the last row except for the first, and the entries on the top row are $3, -2,0$ , followed by $-1$ 's and ending with $2$ (the sequence stops whenever $n$ is reached, so if $n=3$ , the entries would be $3,-2,0$ ). Finally, perform the operations $R_i \mapsto R_i + R_{i+1}$ for $2\leq i\le n-2$ . After performing these operations, for $n=5$ , the following matrix is obtained: $$\begin{pmatrix}
3& -2 & 0 & -1 & 2\\

0 & 0 & 1 & 0  & -2\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -2\\
2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3

I think I should split the proof into cases based on the remainder when $n$ is divided by $6$ , which is suggested by the formula at the beginning.

Some observation: If $t$ is smooth and $F_t (x, t) \neq 0$ for all $(x, t)$ , $t$ satisfies the PDE $$ \nabla t = \frac{1}{F_t (x, t(x))} \big(\nabla G (x)- \nabla F(x, t(x))\big).$$ so when e.g. $n=1$ , this becomes an ODE and is always solvable and $t$ is smooth.

g^{ij}\left(\phi_{ij}-\Gamma^k{}_{ij}\phi_{k}\right)=0
$$ Where $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are Christoffel symbols of $g$ and I denote derivatives by subscripts. Looking at the structure we can notice that adding to $\Gamma^k_{ij}$ a tensor let's say $S^k_{ij}$ which has the property that the vector $g^{ij}S^k{}_{ij}=0$ , this change doesn't affect the equation. This would correspond to adding a metric $h$ to $g$ such that $S$ are Christoffel symbols of $h$ .

Secondly, I would like to ask for some references where this is explored, I tried googling but I didn't quite know what to write and that what I tried didn't quite find any papers or something like that.

4300715,How can $f(x) = x^2$ be continuous?,"I know $f(x) = x^2$ is continuous because it is defined in every point. My question is related to an idea I had. I am curious if formal mathematics has approached this same concept in a formal way. My idea is as follows If we evaluate $f(x)=x^2$ from $x=1$ to $x=2$ , then the domain is $[1<x<2]$ and the range is $[1<x<4]$ .
If it is continuous, then we can choose any point $y'$ in the range $1$ to $4$ , and find a value $x'$ that satisfies the relation $y'=(x')^2$ and where $x$ has a value between $1$ and $2$ . The same applies the other way: if we choose any value $x''$ between $1$ and $2$ , we can find a value $y''$ that is located between $1$ and $4$ , and that satisfies the relation $y''=(x'')^2$ . Since both, $x''$ and $y'$ were arbitrary, that means that the set of values from $1$ to $2$ (the domain) has the same size as the set of values from $1$ to $4$ (the range), but that is not possible. I know there are infinite values between two given numbers, and that comparing infinities is often a problem. However, I am interested in how can $x^2$ be continuous if basic logic says that the infinite range is bigger than the domain. I am starting with mathematical analysis, so my logic is probably wrong, but if so, I would like to know what I am missing. Also, English is not my first language. I apologize in advance if I am not using the proper terms. EDIT: I was focused on my idea and I gave a wrong definition of continuity.

If example $i$ belongs to class $k$ , then the label vector $y_i$ has a $1$ in the $k$ th position and zeros elsewhere. Our goal is to find vectors $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_K \in \mathbb R^{d+1}$ such that $$
\tag{1} y_i \approx S\left(\begin{bmatrix} \hat x_i^T \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \hat x_i^T \beta_K \end{bmatrix} \right) \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, N.
$$ Here $\hat x_i \in \mathbb R^{d+1}$ is the ""augmented"" feature vector obtained by prepending a $1$ to the feature vector $x_i \in \mathbb R^d$ , and $S:\mathbb R^K \to \mathbb R^K$ is the softmax function defined by $$
S(u) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{e^{u_1}}{e^{u_1} + \cdots + e^{u_K}} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{e^{u_K}}{e^{u_1} + \cdots + e^{u_K}} \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{for all vectors } u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ \vdots \\ u_K \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb R^K.
$$ The softmax function is useful in machine learning because it converts a vector into a ""probability vector"" (that is, a vector whose components are nonnegative and sum to $1$ ).
Equation (1) can be expressed more concisely using vector and matrix notation as follows. Define $$
\beta = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_1 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_K \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb R^{K(d+1)} \quad \text{and} \quad M_i = \begin{bmatrix} \hat x_i^T & & & \\ & \hat x_i^T & & \\ & & \ddots & \\ & & & \hat x_i^T \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb R^{K \times K(d+1)}.
$$ Then equation (1) says that we hope that $$
y_i \approx S(M_i \beta) \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots N.
$$ I think of $S(M_i \beta) \in \mathbb R^K$ as being a ""predicted probability vector"" which tells you how strongly our model believes that example $i$ belongs to each of the $K$ classes. And $y_i$ is
a ""ground truth"" probability vector which reflects certainty about which of the $K$ classes example $i$ belongs to. We will use the cross-entropy loss function $$
\ell(p,q) = \sum_{k=1}^K -p_k \log(q_k)

\tag{2} L(\beta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ell(y_i, S(M_i \beta)).
$$ We can minimize $L(\beta)$ using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, or Newton's method.

I emphasize that I am asking this as a serious mathematical question looking for a simple formula or a proof that it does not exist. Or at least some other mathematical studies of this problem including work on the complexity of the problem. I am able to write naive brute force numerical code to determine the appropriate value in individual cases. So code to do this is not the interest here except perhaps if it represents a considerable reduction of complexity over the brute force naive method. The interest is in the mathematics - hence the posting in mathematics stack exchange. Where I got to ... The derivative of $|x-a_k|^{2n}$ is $2n(x-a_k)^{2n-1}$ because the absolute value is redundant in this case. The problem is then solved by finding the roots of a polynomial. It is as hard or easy as that task. But for odd powers, $|x-a_k|^{2n+1}$ , the derivative is $(2n+1)sgn(x-a_k)(x-a_k)^{2n}$ , where sgn is the signum (or sign) function. Hence, the derivative of the sum is $(2n+1)\sum_k sgn(x-a_k)(x-a_k)^{2n}$ , which is the negative sum of some of the terms and the positive sum of the rest. It is equal to zero when the balance point $m$ is found so that $\sum_{k=1}^m (x-a_k)^{2n} = \sum_{k=m+1}^n (x-a_k)^{2n}$ , assuming that the $a_k$ are ordered so that $s_k \le a_{k+1}$ . One could, of course, solve this numerically. For the cubic (and more generally) it would be a kind of median in the sense that is would be the point that balances $\sum (x-a_k)^2$ , so that there is equal weight of this on either side. This seems to be the more general concept - as the mean balances $\sum (x-a_k)^1$ and the median $\sum (x-a_k)^0$ . Notice that each $(x-a_k)^{2n}$ is positive definite with monotonic derivative. And so the sum of any of them is positive. If you partition it with nothing on the right then the left set is greater. Nothing on the left and the right set is greater. At some unique point they must flip over. That is there is a particular $k=m$ such that swapping this changes the balance. Now, if you put $x=a_m$ , then they will be imbalanced. If the left is bigger, then reduces $x$ so that some of $(x-a_k)^{2n}$ will be subtracted, or the other way if the left is smaller. From this it is apparent that there exists a unique such $x$ . It will be between $a_{m-1}$ and $a_{m+1}$ . Except in the case that there are less than 3 points, which can be handled separately. Can anyone give me references to other work on this problem?","['optimization', 'statistics']"

4301042,Riemann-Hurwitz proof from Lang's Introdution to Algebraic and Abelian Functions,"I was studying the proof of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula in the book Introdution to Algebraic and Abelian Functions by Serge Lang (chapter 1, section 6): Theorem . Let $k$ be algebraically closed, and let $K$ be a function field with $k$ as constant field. Let $E$ be a finite separable extension of $K$ of degree $n$ . Let $g_E$ and $g_K$ be the genera of $E$ and $K$ respectively. For each point $P$ of $K$ , and each point $Q$ of $E$ above $P$ , assume that the ramification index $e_Q$ is prime to the characteristic of $k$ . Then $$2g_E-2=n(2g_K-2)+\sum_Q (e_Q-1).$$ Proof . If $\omega$ is any non-zero differential form of $K$ , then we know that its degree is $2g_K-2$ . Such a form can be written as $ydx$ , with $x,y\in K$ . We can also view $x,y$ as elements of $E$ ; we can compute the degree in $E$ , and compare it with that in $K$ to the formula, as follows. Let $P$ be a point of $K$ , and let $t$ be a local parameter at $P$ , that is an element of order $1$ at $P$ in $K$ . If $u$ is a local parameter at $Q$ , then $$t=u^ev,$$ where $v$ is a unit at $Q$ . Furthermore, $dt=u^edv+eu^{e-1}vdu$ . Hence $$\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=e_Q\cdot\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+(e_Q-1).$$ Summing over all $Q$ over $P$ , and then over all $P$ yields the formula. I have two questions: I don't see why $dt=u^e dv+eu^{e-1}vdu$ implies $$\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+(e_Q-1)$$ When we have the following formula $$\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+(e_Q-1)$$ it says that summing over all $Q$ over $P$ we are done. I don't see why, since: $$\sum_Q\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=\sum_Q e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)+\sum_Q(e_Q-1)$$ Hence, in order to finish the prove we need that $\sum_Q\operatorname{ord}_Q(ydx)=2g_E-2$ and $\sum_Q e_Q\operatorname{ord}_P(ydx)=n(2g_K-2)$ , but none of this formulas seems trivial to me. I am not sure whether these facts are easy consequences of previous results of the book or not, since there are not any similar result in the previous sections.

Because $\mathcal L_1 (X, \mu, F')$ is complete, there exists $\Phi \in \mathcal L_1 (X, \mu, F')$ such that $\Phi_n \to \Phi$ in $\mathcal L_1 (X, \mu, F')$ . By Lemma 3 , there is a subsequence $\varphi$ of $(0, 1, \ldots,)$ such that $\Phi_{\varphi(n)} \to \Phi$ $\mu$ -a.e. Let $\Phi: x \mapsto [\hat f_x]$ with $\hat f_x \in \mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ . Then for $\mu$ -a.e. $x \in X$ , $[f_{\varphi(n), x}] \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} [\hat f_{x}]$ in $F'$ and thus $f_{\varphi(n), x} \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \hat f_{x}$ in $\mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ . Notice that $\mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ is complete (w.r.t. the semi-norm $\| \cdot \|_1$ ), so $(f_{\varphi(n), x})_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ for $\mu$ -a.e. $x \in X$ . By Lemma 3 again, for $\mu$ -a.e. $x \in X$ , there is a subsequence $\tau_x$ of $\varphi$ such that $f_{\tau_x(n), x} \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} \hat f_{x}$ $\nu$ -a.e. We have already proved that for $\mu$ -a.e. $x \in X$ , $f_{n,x} \xrightarrow{n \to \infty} f_x$ $\nu$ -a.e. Hence $\hat f_x = f_x$ $\nu$ -a.e. As such, for $\mu$ -a.e. $x \in X$ , $(f_{\varphi (n), x})_n$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ that converges to $f_x$ both in $\mathcal  L_1 (Y, \nu, E)$ and $\nu$ -a.e.

4301426,Neural odes: What is the relationship between backpropagation and the adjoint sensitivity method,"I was reading the Neural ODE paper by Chen, Duvenaud, et. al. and trying to understand the relationship between backpropagation and the adjoint sensitivity method. I also looked at Gil Strang's latest book Linear Algebra and Learning from Data for some more background on both backpropagation and the adjoint method. It seems like both backpropagation and the adjoint method will compute the gradient of a scalar function. So if I have my loss function $\mathcal{L} = \sum_i^{N}(y_i - f(x, \theta)^2$ , and I want to optimize the parameters $\theta$ to minimize the loss, then I could use reverse mode automatic differentiation, a.k.a backpropagation, to get the $\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\theta}$ . But it also seems like the adjoint method is a different way to obtain the same $\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\theta}$ ? I was not clear no whether the adjoint method was a necessary step in reverse mode automatic differentiation? Or is it that applying the adjoint method will just reorganize some steps in the reverse mode AD calculation to make it faster? I understand that the paper's big claim is that using adjoint sensitivities allows us to solve neural odes faster compared to backprop, but I was not clear on how backprop and adjoint methods are different?

It is then proved that a finite group’s ( $G$ ) representation over $\operatorname{Hom}_K(V,W)$ is isomorphic to $\pi \otimes \rho^*$ , where $\pi$ and $\rho$ are representations of $G$ over $V$ and $W$ respectively, and $\rho^*$ is the dual representation corresponding to $\rho$ . I think I followed the proofs so far, but I’m a bit lost regarding the motivation behind all of this. If I understand correctly, representation theory is for instance used to study groups through their actions on vector spaces, in order to reduce abstract algebra problems into linear algebra ones, which are in general easier. Following this line of reasoning, are dual representations/tensor products of representations especially useful to capture some particular aspects of the abstract groups from where they arise? If so, why? Or is there an altogether different reason why they’re interesting? P.S.: I included the “characters” tag because my lecture notes later define the character of a dual representation and show that it can be computed by $\chi_{V^*}(g)=\chi_V(g^{-1})$ .

In first case we have $\int_t^1 \int_0^x f(y) \ dy \ dx= \lambda f(t) $ $\int_1^t\int_0^x f(y) \ dy \ dx = -\lambda f(t) $ . Now can I take $f \in C\big([0;1] \big)$ .

Second equation is $\int_0^1 K(x,t) \int_0^1 K(x,y) f(y) \ dy \ dx= \lambda f(t)$ .
When I write out integral on left side of equation I will obtain \begin{equation*}\int_0^1 K(x,t) \Bigg( \int_x^1 x(y-1) f(y) \ dy + \int_0^x y(x-1) f(y) \ dy \Bigg) \ dx = \lambda f(t)\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}\int_0^1 K(x,t) \Bigg( x \int_0^1 y f(y) \ dy - x \int_x^1 f(y) \ dy - \int_0^x y f(y) \ dy \Bigg) \ dx = \lambda f(t)\end{equation*} Now outer integral can be rewritten in the same way.

4301738,Equal area parameterization of a torus?,"I am trying to parameterise a surface of revolution such that each infinitesimal area element is uniform across the surface. The cross-sections of the surface are shown in the picture below. The title of the post refers to a torus as I thought this might be an easier place to start. However, I really want to know how to do this for a surface with a general cross-section like the one below. Here is what I have tried so far... Let $l_\theta$ denote the length and coordinate along the contour shown below in the $x$ - $z$ plane. Where I am using $\theta$ here as a reference to the poloidal direction in ""Toroidal and poloidal coordinates"" . Let $R(l_\theta)$ denote the distance to the corresponding point from the $z$ -axis.

Let $$s_\theta = \frac{A_{tot}}{2\pi R(l_\theta)}\frac{l_\theta}{l_{tot}},$$ where $A_{tot}$ gives the total area of the surface and $l_{tot}$ give the total length of the contour. Note that $$\begin{aligned}
ds_{\theta} &= dl_\theta\frac{ds_\theta}{dl_\theta} \\
&= dl_\theta\frac{A_{tot}}{2\pi l_{tot}}\left(\frac{1}{R(l_\theta)}-\frac{l_\theta}{R(l_\theta)^2}\frac{dR}{dl_\theta}\right)

Exercise 2.2.8 in Hatcher's text asks the reader to consider a complex polynomial $p:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ . If this polynomial is nonconstant, then setting $p(\infty)=\infty$ gives an extension of $p$ to the one point compactification $p:\hat{\mathbb{C}} \to \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ . But $\hat{\mathbb C} \approx S^2$ , so one can consider the homological degree of $p$ . Turns out, this degree is equal to the degree of $p$ as a polynomial. $$\deg p_* = \deg p$$ If you do this whole thing over $\mathbb{R}$ instead, with one point compacitication $\hat{\mathbb R} \approx S^1$ , you don't get an analagous result. If $p(x)=a_nx^n + \dotsb +a_1x+a_0$ with $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ (and $a_n \not= 0$ ), then $$\deg p_* = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if $n$ is even} \\ \operatorname{sign} a_n & \text{if $n$ is odd} \end{cases}$$ where $\operatorname{sign}$ is the $\pm 1$ sign of a nonzero real number. This led me to wonder what happens in other scenarios. For instance, what happens over the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ with $\hat{\mathbb H} \approx S^4$ ? I'm not even sure what ""quaternionic polynomial"" would mean since the quaternions aren't commutative, so expressions like $i \cdot q \cdot i$ and $(i^2)q=-q$ aren't equivalent. What about other complete fields, like $p$ -adics $\mathbb{Q}_p$ ? These spaces are much worse topologically, in particular totally disconnected. But one can still consider the projective lines $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ (which is the same as the one point compactification in the $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ case at least).

0 & \text{ if } t< 0 \\
1 & \text{ if } t\geq  0 
\end{cases}$$ without the use of Laplace. Given the derivative in the right-hand-side, I thought about using the linearity property in order to make the problem more typical: $$\ddot{y}+5\dot{y}+6y=u,$$ $$x = \dot{y}+y $$ So, if that was correct, the initial problem consists now in solving the second ode: finding $y$ , its derivative and then summing them up to find the $x$ .
I calculated the homogeneous solution: $$y_{h}(t)=(c_{1}e^{-2t}+c_{2}e^{-3t})u(t)$$ and the particular one: $$y_{p}(t)=\frac{1}{6}u(t)$$ The total $y$ solution is $$y(t)=(c_{1}e^{-2t}+c_{2}e^{-3t})u(t)+\frac{1}{6}u(t)$$ , while its derivative is $$\dot{y}=-2c_{1}e^{-2t}-3c_{2}e^{-3t}$$ The solution $x$ is $$x(t)=-c_{1}e^{-2t}-2c_{2}e^{-3t}+\frac{1}{6}$$ , but we also need to calculate its derivative in order to get the values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ . So, we have: $$\dot{x}=2c_{1}e^{-2t}+6c_{2}e^{-3t}$$ , and the constants are $c_{1}=-\frac{33}{6}$ and $c_{2}=\frac{11}{6}$ The correct result (found through Laplace) is $$x(t)=\frac{1}{6}+6.5e^{-2t}-4.67e^{-3t}$$ .
Needless to say that as many time as i have solved it, I never got this result, therefore I believe that the problem is not in the actual calculations but in the strategy of solving the problem.
Would someone help shed some light on where I have made mistakes? Second question:
An alternative way of computing the particular solution is based on the use of the Wronskian, provided that we already know the two solutions of the homogeneous equation. The form I have followed is this: $$y_{p}(t)=-y_{1}\int \frac{y_{2}}{W}u(t)dt+y_{2}\int \frac{y_{1}}{W}u(t)dt$$ , where $W = y_{1}\dot{y_{2}}-y_{2}\dot{y_{1}}$ , comes from its definition. After replacing the functions and knowing that $u$ is the unit step function, we have to solve the indefinite integrals. We could probably get rid of the step function in the integral if we made the integral from $0^{+}$ to $t$ , but that would give an extra term from the integration. If we want this result to match the result that was found above, we only have to ""keep"" the validation at $t$ and not at $0^{+}$ . Why are we not keeping in general the validation at the ""down limit"" of the integral?","['wronskian', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

4301831,Obtaining the Dolbeault operator on the pullbak of the holomorphic tangent bundle.,"I have ran into a question while reading this paper by Witten. The question is mostly mathematical, so I thought it would be better posed here instead of on Physics SE. Let $X$ be a Kahler manifold, $\Sigma$ a Riemann surface and $\Phi:\Sigma\to X$ be a smooth map. Let $TX=T^{1,0}X\oplus T^{0,1}X$ be the complexified tangent bundle of $X$ . I am interested in understanding what the Dolbeault operator on $\Phi^{*}(T^{1,0}X)$ looks like. My first attempt was to assume that the Dolbeault operator on $\Phi^{*}(T^{1,0}X)$ should be the pullback of the Dolbeault operator on the holomorphic tangent bundle $T^{1,0}X$ , which itself should be obtained from the splitting of the Hermitian connection $\nabla$ on $X$ into its $(0,1)$ -form part. I think I mostly understand how $\nabla$ works (it is similar to the Levi-Civita connection, with which I am somewhat familiar), and from there I seem to be able to understand the splitting, $\nabla s =\partial s + \bar{\partial}s$ . My issue is that $\bar{\partial}$ seems to be zero on $T^{1,0}X$ . In particular, we can locally write a section of the holomorphic tangent bundle as $s=v^{i}\partial_{z^{i}}$ with holomorphic coefficient functions, then: $$
\nabla_{\partial_{z}^{i}}
(s)
=
\left(
\frac{\partial v^{j}}{\partial z^{i}}
+
v^{k}\Gamma^{j}_{ik}
\right)
\partial_{z^{j}}
$$ Then as far as I can tell we have: $$
\nabla s
=
\left(
\frac{\partial v^{j}}{\partial z^{i}}
+
v^{k}\Gamma^{j}_{ik}
\right)
dz^{j}\otimes \partial_{z^{i}}
\in\Omega^{1,0}(X)\otimes T^{1,0}X
$$ i.e. $\nabla s$ is a $(1,0)$ form-valued section, and thus $\bar{\partial}s=0$ . This also fits with the intuitive idea that $\bar{\partial}$ of a holomorphic vector field should vanish. I have good reason to believe that $\bar{\partial}$ on $\Phi^{*}(T^{1,0}X)$ is not trivial, so it seems like this is the wrong way to obtain this operator. My next guess would be to pull back $\nabla$ via $\Phi$ , and then separate the result into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts, but I am not so sure about this. I would appreciate any help understanding how to correctly obtain/define $\bar{\partial}$ on $\Phi^{*}(T^{1,0}X)$ , as well as any verification that what I have done above is correct. EDIT:
As far as I know the pullback of a holomorphic vector bundle by a non-holomorphic map needs not be holomorphic, so I don't even see why $\bar{\partial}$ makes sense on $\Phi^{*}(T^{1,0}X)$ .","['complex-geometry', 'vector-bundles', 'holomorphic-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
4301839,A Markov Chain ($Y_n$) based on the stopping time of another Markov Chain $X_n$,"Problem Setting: If $(X_n)^{\infty}_{n=0}$ is a homogeneous Markov chain with state space $S$ and a transition matrix $P = (p_{ij})$ where $p_{ii} < 1$ for all $I \in S$ and consider $(Y_n)^{\infty}_{n=0}$ to be a sequence of new values for $X_n$ , then we let $\tau_m$ be the $m$ -th time where we see a new value of $X_n$ . For example, if $(X_0, X_1, ... , X_{10}) = (1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3,2,1)$ , then we will have $Y_0 = 1, Y_1 = 2, Y_2 = 1, Y_3 = 3, Y_4 = 2, Y_5 = 1$ and $\tau_1 = 3, \tau_2 = 5, \tau_3 = 6, \tau_4 = 9, \tau_5 = 10$ . Since we have known the t.p.m $P$ for $X_n$ , how can we find the transition probability matrix for $Y_n$ in terms of $P$ . Attempt: We have known that $\tau_m$ are stopping times with respect to $X_n$ .
I think that $$
P(Y_n = j | Y_{n-1} = i) = P(X_{\tau_n} = j | X_{\tau_{n-1}} = i) = P_{ij}^{(\tau_n - \tau_{n-1})},
$$ since $Y_n$ and $X_n$ share the same state space and initial distribution. But I am not sure whether this is a correct case. This is because, by the definition, the diagonal of the transition probability matrix for $Y_n$ should be 0 ( $Y_n$ only records the new value in $X_n$ ). If I follow this thought, it seems that the $Y_n$ is not homogeneous. So I am wondering how can I find the t.p.m for $Y_n$ in terms of $P$ and what is the relationship between two M.C. $X_n$ and $Y_n$ ?","['statistics', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes', 'stopping-times', 'probability']"

4301962,"Topological ""Freshman's Dream""","When one learns about quotient and product spaces in topology for the first time, it is perhaps natural to expect that they would behave like mutual inverses: Topological Freshman's Dream (TFD). For a space $X$ and subspace $\emptyset \neq Y\subseteq X$ , the spaces $(X/Y)\times Y$ and $X$ are homeomorphic. It is not too hard to see that TFD is not true even for very simple spaces. For example, pick $X=[0,1]$ and $Y=\{0,1\}$ , then $X/Y\times Y$ is the disjoint union of two copies of $S^1$ , obviously not the same as $X$ . There are two trivial cases when TFD does hold, when $Y$ is a single point and when $Y$ is the whole space $X$ . Q. Is there any nontrivial example when TFD holds ? I've tried for a while to construct such an example without success. Some incomplete observations: If $X$ is connected, then $Y$ must be as well. Otherwise, $(X/Y)\times Y$ would be disconnected. We can apply the tools of algebraic topology to see, for example, that TFD implies $\pi_n(X)\cong\pi_n(X/Y)\times\pi_n(Y)$ . This condition is quite hard to satisfy since it implies that the homotopy groups of the quotient space $X/Y$ are simpler than that of $X$ , which generally fails quite spectatularly. A similar idea can also be applied to the homology and cohomology groups. A special case of the above point implies that if $X$ is simply connected, then both $Y$ and $X/Y$ are simply connected (take the fundamental group $\pi_1$ ). Any input is appreciated!","['general-topology', 'examples-counterexamples', 'quotient-spaces']"
4302014,Group Action and the Bell Number,"I am struggling on solving the inequality related to the group action and Bell numbers. Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a set $X$ with $m$ elements. Prove that for each $1 \leq r \leq m$ , $$\frac{1}{ \lvert G \rvert}\sum_{g \in G} \lvert F_g \rvert^r \geq B_r$$ where $F_g$ is the fix of $g \in G$ (the set of elements in $X$ which are fixed under the action of $g$ )and $B_r$ is the Bell number of order $r$ . I have studied Burnside Lemma (which has the similar form with the lhs of the given inequality) so I tried to use the approach when proving it, but I am stuck because of the $r$ -power in the summand. I also thought of giving appropriate surjection from the collection of fixes and the collection of every partition on an $m$ -set, but it doesn’t look like a good approach. It will be glad if anyone share me an insight on this problem.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'combinatorics', 'bell-numbers', 'group-actions']"

4302076,How long does it take until the tank contains the same amount of both liquid A and liquid B?,"A tank initially contains 400 litres of liquid A. Liquid B is pumped
into the tank at the rate of 20 litres per minute. The contents of the
tank is pumped out at the same rate of 20 litres per minute. The
mixture is stirred continuously and the tank is kept full at 400
litres at all times. Let X (t) denote the amount (in litres) of liquid
A in the tank after t minutes. How long does it take until the tank contains the same amount of both liquid A and liquid B? This is a problem I've seen and solved a few times in different forms and while I understand how to solve it mechanically I don't know why certain choices are made. I determine that: $ X(t) = 400(1 - e^{-t/20})$ I know from here to answer the above question I would need to solve for $t$ in the below equation: $200 = 400(1 - e^{-t/20})$ As I understand it $X(t)$ is the mixture of $A$ and $B$ at a point in time. So if $X(t)$ makes up 200L of the 400L then the tank would be 50% $A$ and 50% ( $A$ , $B$ ) Why have we chosen 200 for $X(t)$ ?
