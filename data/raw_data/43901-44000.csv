436716,Linear and circular distance to horizon,"I recently had a chance to go to a sea-shore and to also ponder the question: ""What is the farthest point on the horizon that I can theoretically see, ignoring the effects of fog, clouds, waves, tide, and non-uniform curvature of Earth?"" So, I got to work, and derived the formula thus: Assuming... Earth to be a perfect sphere of radius, r ; My height (at eye-level) to be, h ; and The linear distance to the horizon to be, d ; Then, $(r+h)^2 = d^2 + r^2$    (via Pythagoras theorem) Or, $d = (h^2 + 2rh) ^.5$ Also, the curved distance, c , to the horizon, would be: $c = r . arccos (r / (r+h) )$ However, here begins my difficulty. When I substitute the values... r = 6370 km
h = 180 cm   (or, 6 ft) ... I get, d = 4.58 km   (reasonable, appears correct)
c = 274 km    (!!!) ... which doesn't make sense to me! Why so much difference between c and d ? Intuitively, I am expecting c to be very close to d . Why? Because, the surface of Earth is more or less flat, and when dealing with a linear distance, d , in the vicinity of merely 5 km , the curved distance, c , should also be very close to d . Isn't it? Where am I wrong in my intuitive thinking (as, afaik, my formula and computation are correct)?",['geometry']

436779,variance of number of divisors,"Let $d(i)$ be the number of divisors of $i$. I know that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1\le i \le n} d(i)= \ln n+\Theta(1)$ as $n$ grows, this can be seen by asking, for each $j$, how many $i$ are there such that $j$ contributes to $d(i)$. This statement can be interpreted as computing the average number of divisors of a random number between 1 and $n$. I'm wondering how to study $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1\le i \le n} d(i)^2$, as a way to compute the variance of the number of divisors of a random number between 1 and $n$. This worksheet (see Exercise 2.10) indicates that $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{1\le i \le n} d(i)^2=\Theta(\ln^3 n)$. Is there an easy way to see this?","['elementary-number-theory', 'probability']"
436785,"Example of integral pairs or triples ($I$, $J$, $K$...)","A somewhat common trick when evaluating integrals is to add a second (or third) integral 
to help integrate the first. As an example if one where to compute 
$$
     I = \int \sin \log x \, \mathrm{d}x\,.
$$
A clever step would be to introduce the integral
$$
     J = \int \cos \log x \, \mathrm{d}x\,,
$$
and to turn the problem into a system of equations.
Since now it is easy to show by parts that
$$
\begin{align*}
I + J & = \left[ x \sin \log x - J \right] + J \\
J - I & = \left[ x \cos \log x + I \right] - I 
\end{align*}
$$
One can now solve this system of equation with ease. As one can see
to integrate $I$ or $J$ by itself is somewhat cumbersome (One can use the substitution $t = \log x$, and then rewrite the remaining expression into a complex one, or use more integration by parts, but both methods are somewhat tedious), but by looking at their products or difference the computation can be simplified. Another example are the integrals
$$
  I = \int \frac{\cos x}{\cos x + \sin x}\,\mathrm{d}x 
               \quad \text{and} \quad
  J = \int \frac{\sin x}{\cos x + \sin x}\,\mathrm{d}x

436892,Number of Regions in the Plane defined by $n$ Zig-Zag Lines,"Fellows of Math.SE, I have been scratching my head at a solution to an exercise in Donald Knuth's Concrete Math. Here is the problem: Here is the solution (I hid it in case someone wants to solve this on their own) Given $n$ straight lines that define $L_n$ regions, we can replace them by extremely narrow zig-zags with segments sufficiently long that there are nine intersections between each pair of zig-zags. This shows that $ZZ_n = ZZ_{n−1} +9n−8$, for all $n > 0$; consequently $ZZ_n = 9S_n −8n+1 = \frac{9n^2 − 7n}{2} +1$. $L_n$ is the number of regions definable by $n$ lines, which is solved as an example earlier in the text. It equals $S_n + 1$, where $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n k$. I am having difficulty understanding the recurrence solution. I'll hide my question, just to be extra careful I don't spoil this wonderful problem for anyone. Where does the ""$-8$"" come from? Is the recurrence better understood as $ZZ_n = ZZ_{n−1} +9(n-1)+1$? Or does that further convolute the meaning of the recurrence? I figure there must ""-8"" must have to do with ""lost regions"" due to the half-lines, but I am having trouble putting my finger on it.

436903,How many times can a $4^{th}$ degree polynomial be equal to a prime number?,"If $f(x)$ is a $4^{th}$ degree polynomial with integer coefficients, what is the largest set ${x_1, x_2, x_3, ...x_n}$ (where $x_i$ are integers) for which $|f(x_i)|$ is a prime number? Things I have tried: I tried to see how I can restrict the coefficients of $ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e$ by dividing by $fx+g$. If this worked I could've restricted the coefficients so that hopefully $f(x)$ isn't divisible by such polynomials, but it got really messy so I don't think that's the way to go. Another thing I came up with is that we would probably want this polynomial as $ax^4-bx^3+cx^2-d+e$ , so that when we have $ax^4-bx^3+cx^2-dx+e=-p_i$ , then by Descartes's rule of signs $ax^4-bx^3+cx^2-dx+(e+p_i)=0$ could potentially have up to $4$ solutions. I'm not sure if the problem said $x_i$ are integers, but I believe they have to be because otherwise we could guarantee a solution for every single prime number (therefore the set of $x_i$ would be infinitely large) if we just had one sign change, namely $-ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+(e+p_i)=0$","['elementary-number-theory', 'polynomials', 'algebra-precalculus', 'number-theory']"
436912,Jet bundle - affine bundle,"Suppose $X\rightarrow V$ is a fibre bundle. $X^{(r)}$ denotes the bundle whose fibre at each $x$ is the set of all equivalence classes of $r$-jets. Since $r$-tangency is a finer equivalence relation for larger $r$, it follows that there are canonical projections $X^{(r)}\rightarrow X^{(r-1)}$. An exercise says that this is a bundle with affine fibre. I do know, a space being merely affine implies, that there's no canonical choice of a zero vector but that there's a transitive action of a vector space on it. But the projection is just $(x,f(x),...D^kf(x) ... D^{r-1}f(x),D^rf(x))\rightarrow (x,f(x),...D^kf(x) ... D^{r-1}f(x))$ where $D^kf(x)$ is the tuple of all order $k$ partial derivatives of $f$ at $x$. I don't understand why only 'affine' and why isn't there a canonical zero section. Is it because you can't always find $g$ which is ($r-1$)-tangent to $f$ at $x$ and has all order $r$ derivatives vanishing at $x$? Thankful in advance for clarification.",['differential-geometry']

437044,A twisted version of module homomorphism,"EDIT : I am still hoping for further responses to this question, but perhaps it isn't focussed enough and as I'm unsure what the best way is to improve it, I'll leave it as it is and let it sit here for the time being. The following notion has appeared in my work and I am wondering if anyone can help me to understand it. I am not an algebraist and this seems like something that one might be able to say something about. See below for my motivation for this question. I put it there because the context of it isn't necessary to understand the question. Thank-you for any insight offered. Background The definition of a module over a ring $R$ is an Abelian group $M$ along with a homomorphism $R \to EndM$ (the module is 'left' or 'right' depending on which multiplication we choose for the endomorphism ring). A homomorphism of $R$-modules is a homomorphism of Abelian groups $\varphi : M \to N$ that makes $$\begin{array}[c]{ccccc}
&&EndM&&\\
&\nearrow&&\stackrel{\circ\varphi}{\searrow}&\\
R&&&&Hom(M,N)\\
&\searrow&&\stackrel{\varphi \circ}{\nearrow}&\\
&&EndN&&
\end{array}$$ commute, where the maps on the left are ring homomorphisms (defining the modules) and the maps on the right are given by pre- and post-composition, and where $Hom(M,N)$ is considered to be merely a set. I want to consider a different definition of homomorphism. Question Our definition of ~homomorphism shall be a pair $(\phi,\varphi)$ where $\phi$ is an endomorphism of $R$ and $\varphi$ is a homomorphism of Abelian groups such that $$\begin{array}[c]{ccccc}
R&\rightarrow&EndM&&\\
&&&\stackrel{\circ\varphi}{\searrow}&\\
\small{\phi} \downarrow&&&&Hom(M,N)\\
&&&\stackrel{\varphi \circ}{\nearrow}&\\
R&\rightarrow&EndN&&
\end{array}$$ commutes. Does this definition make sense, is it useful, and if so where can I read about these structures? It is true that any such ~homomorphism induces a homomorphism (in the usual sense) from $M$ to a new module with ring action defined by $\phi$ and that of $N$. However, this new module depends on $\phi$; you can't do this for all ~homomorphisms at once. You'll see from my motivation that this is of no use to me. I would also like to know the merits of such a definition applied to modules over different rings (replace the lower copy of $R$ in the diagram above with another ring $S$). Some interesting things seem to happen, for example the inclusion of a real vector space into its complexification is a ~homomorphism; more generally a complex vector space can have real subspaces in the genuine morphism sense. Complex conjugate-linear maps are also ~homomorphisms. One has to be careful though, because a bijective ~homomorphism is not necessarily an ~isomorphism. This happens in other categories too, e.g. a smooth bijection need not be a diffeomorphism etc., so I see no problem immediately. Motivation from geometry (skip if you like) My motivation for a different definition of homomorphism comes from geometry. The tangent space of a (locally-irreducible) hyper-Kähler manifold can be considered as a copy of the standard representation of $Sp_n$ on $\mathbb{R}^{4n}$. The action of $Sp_n$ preserves the subalgebra $\mathbb{H} \subset End\mathbb{R}^{4n}$ pointwise (where this time we mean linear endomorphisms). We can therefore consider the tangent space to be a left $\mathbb{H}$-module and the group $Sp_n$ to consist of module homomorphisms. Consider now the tangent space of a quaternionic-Kähler manifold. This can be considered as the representation of $Sp_n \cdot Sp_1$ on $\mathbb{R}^{4n}$. The group action preserves the same subalgebra $\mathbb{H} \subset End\mathbb{R}^{4n}$ but this time the induced action on this subalgebra is by $Sp_n \cdot Sp_1 \to SO_3$ (the second factor) and this is an irreducible action. In fact $SO_3$ is the automorphism group of the real algebra $\mathbb{H}$ (and also of the ring $\mathbb{H}$). In this situation we cannot consider the tangent space to be an $\mathbb{H}$-module, but rather as a module in the twisted sense above.","['modules', 'abstract-algebra']"
437051,How to prove that $C(a)=C(a^3)$ when $|a|=5$,"I am having trouble proving the following result: ""Suppose $a$ belongs to a group and $|a|=5$.  Prove that $C(a)=C(a^3)$.""

Similar to matrix notation for linear operators over $R^n$ (in fact matrices work just fine over $C^n$ as well) does there exist some type of concise ""box of numbers and stuff"" notation for handling quadratic operators?

If I allow only pure polynomials then I have a syntax for working with matrix-like objects that can handle composition just fine (it generalizes cleanly to higher powers) but I lose the ability to handle mixed expressions.

However, I don't understand how to prove this. The book example gives the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is $\mathcal O(x^2)$.

437161,Simple proof of Cauchy's theorem in Group theory,"I will refer to the following simple proof of Cauchy's theorem that appears in chapter 33 of Pinter's A Book of Abstract Algebra . I have copied it below so my question can be properly understood. This proof is crystal clear, however what I cannot understand is why $p$ has to be a prime number? It seems to me that the proof works for any divisor of $|G|$. Could somebody clarify this? I would appreciate it. Cauchy's theorem: Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n$ and let $p$ be a prime divisor of $n$, then $G$ has an element of order $p$. Pinter proves Cauchy's theorem specifically for $p=5$; however, he says, the same argument works for any value of $p$. Consider all possible 5-tuples $(a, b, c, d, k)$ of elements of $G$ whose product $abcdk =e$. How many distinct 5-tuples of this kind are there? Well, if we select $a, b, c$ and $d$ at random, there is a unique $k=d^{-1} c^{-1} b^{-1} a^{-1}$ in $G$ making $abcdk = e$. Thus, there are $n^4$ such 5-tuples. Call two 5-tuples equivalent if one is merely a cyclic permutation of the 
other. Thus, $(a, b, c, d, k)$ is equivalent to exactly five distinct 5-tuples,
namely $(a, b, c, d, k)$, $(b, c, d, k, a)$, $(c, d, k, a, b)$, $(d, k, a, b, c)$ and
$(k, a, b, c, d)$. The only exception occurs when a 5-tuple is of the form $(a, a, a, a, a)$ with all its components equal; it is equivalent only to itself. Thus, the equivalence class of any 5-tuple of the form $(a, a, a, a, a)$ has a single member, while all the other equivalence classes have five members. Are there any equivalence classes, other than ${(e, e, e, e, e)}$, with a
single member? If not then $5$ divides $(n^4-1)$ (for there are $n^4$ 5-tuples under
consideration, less $(e, e, e, e, e)$), hence $n^4\equiv 1\pmod 5$. But we are assuming
that 5 divides $n$, hence $n^4\equiv 0\pmod 5$, which is a contradiction. This contradiction shows that there must be a 5-tuple $(a,a,a,a,a)\neq(e, e, e, e, e)$ such that $aaaaa=a^5=e$. Thus, there is an element $a\in G$ of
order 5. ■","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

437520,Asymptotic behaviour of the riemannian metric in polar coordinates,"I'm studying the section 7 (""Local Geometry in Constant Curvature) of chapter 5 of ""Riemannian Geometry"" written by Petersen. At the beginning there is a Lemma which says how behaves the metric $g$ of a Riemannian manifold $M$ around a point $p$ in normal coordinates:
$$
g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + O(r^2).
$$
where $r$ is the distance from $p$. Then the book says in polar coordinates around $p$ any Riemannian metric has the form:
$$
g = dr^2 + g_r
$$
where $g_r$ is a metric on $S^{n-1}$. We know also that the Euclidean metric looks like:
$$
\delta_{ij} = dr^2 + r^2 ds^2_{n-1},
$$
where $ds^2_{n-1}$ is the canonical metric on $S^{n-1}$. Since these two metrics agrees up to the first order (thanks to the Lemma), we have that:
$$
\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}g_r = \lim_{r \rightarrow 0}(r^2 ds^2_{n-1}) = 0
$$
and 
$$
\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\Big(\partial_rg_r - \frac{2}{r}g_r\Big) = \lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\Big(\partial_r(r^2 ds^2_{n-1})- \frac{2}{r}(r^2 ds^2_{n-1})\Big) = 0.
$$ Everything is quite clear so far. But then the book says that since $$ \partial_rg_r = 2\text{Hess}r$$ then we get 
$$
\lim_{r \rightarrow 0}\Big(\text{Hess}r - \frac{1}{r}g_{r}\Big) = 0.

Isomorphisms are $R$-module maps if not mentioned otherwise. Let $m \geq n$ and consider $R^{n} = R^{n} \times 0 \times \cdots \times 0 \subseteq R^{m}$.
We have $\text{Hom}_{R}(R^{n}, R^{m}) \simeq M_{m \times n}(R)$ via $\phi \mapsto M(\phi) = (c_{ij})$ where $\phi(e_{j}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}c_{ij}e_{i}$.

437615,"I need a better explanation of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-definition of limit","I am reading the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of a limit here on Wikipedia . It says that $f(x)$ can be made as close as desired to $L$ by making the independent variable $x$ close enough, but not equal, to the value $c$. So this means that $f(x)$ defines $y$ or the output of the function. So when I say $f(x)$ close as desired to $L$, I actually mean the result of the calculation that has taken place and produced a $y$ close to $L$ which sits on the $y$-axis? How close is ""close enough to $c$"" depends on how close one wants to make $f(x)$ to $L$. So $c$ is actually the $x$'s that I am putting into my $f$ function. So one is picking $c$'s that are $x$'s and entering them into the function, and he actually is picking those $c$'s (sorry, $x$'s) to make his result closer to $L$, which is the limit of an approaching value of $y$? It also of course depends on which function $f$ is, and on which number $c$ is. Therefore let the positive number $\epsilon$ be how close one wishes to make $f(x)$ to $L$; OK, so now one picks a letter $\epsilon$ which means error, and that letter is the value of ""how much one needs to be close to $L$"". So it is actually the $y$ value, or the result of the function again, that needs to be close of the limit which is the $y$-coordinate again? strictly one wants the distance to be less than $\epsilon$. Further, if the positive number $\delta$ is how close one will make $x$ to $c$, Er, this means $\delta=x$, or the value that will be entered into $f$? and if the distance from $x$ to $c$ is less than $\delta$ (but not zero), then the distance from $f(x)$ to $L$ will be less than $\epsilon$. Therefore $\delta$ depends on $\epsilon$. The limit statement means that no matter how small $\epsilon$ is made, $\delta$ can be made small enough. So essentially the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definition of the limit is the corresponding $y$, $x$ definition of the function that we use to limit it around a value? Are my conclusions wrong? I am sorry but it seams like an "" Amazing Three Cup Shuffle Magic Trick"" to me on how my teacher is trying to explain this to me. I always get lost to what letters mean $\epsilon$, $\delta$, $c$, $y$, and $x$, when the function has $x$ and $y$ only.","['functions', 'limits']"

Then $f$ has directional derivatives in all directions at each point. Proof Let $\vec p$ be any non-zero vector in $\Bbb R^2$. Choose $r>0$. By the mean value proposition, we see that if $t$ is any number such that $|t|\lVert \vec p \rVert < r$, then there are $n$ points $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in\Bbb R^2$ such that
$$f(x+t\vec p)-f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n t p_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(z_i)$$
and $\lVert z_i - x \rVert < |t|\lVert p \rVert$ for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Then we can write
$$\frac{f(x+t\vec p)-f(x)} t =\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(z_i)$$ Since $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_i}$ is continuous for each $i$, $$\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{f(x+t\vec p)-f(x)} t = \lim_{t\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(z_i)$$ exists, so $f$ has a derivative in the $\vec p$ direction at $x$.","['solution-verification', 'calculus', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

E.g. the solid torus $B^2\times S^1$ has boundary the torus $S^1\times S^1$, which is not a disjoint union pf spheres. Fuzzy question: If one had a classification of manifolds (up to diffeomorphism/homeomorphism/h-equivalence), could one automatically obtain a clasification of manifolds with boundary? I know that to each manifold $M$ with boundary, there is associated a double manifold $DM$, which is the disjoint union of two copies of $M$, glued along their boundary. But if knew precisely what $DM$ was (in the classification scheme), could we classify $M$ itself? Is any manifold a double of some other manifold, i.e. can every manifold be split into equal halves?","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'compactness', 'differential-geometry']"
437829,The preimage of continuous function on a closed set is closed.,"My proof is very different from my reference, hence I am wondering is I got this right? Apparently, $F$ is continuous, and the identity matrix is closed. Now we want to show that the preimage of continuous function on closed set is closed. Let $D$ be a closed set, Consider a sequence $x_n \to x_0$ in which $x_n \in f^{-1}(D)$, and we will show that $x_0 \in f^{-1}(D)$. Since $f$ is continuous, we have a convergent sequence
$$\lim_{n\to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x_0) = y.$$ But we know $y$ is in the range, hence, $x_0$ is in the domain. So the preimage is also closed since it contains all the limit points. Thank you.",['analysis']
437831,Algebraic proof of De Morgan's law with three sets,"Given: $A'$ $\cup$ $B'$ $\cup$ $C'$ $=$ $(A$ $\cap$ $B$ $\cap$ $C$ $)'$ Problem: Show how the identity above can be proved using two steps of De Morgan's Law along with some other basic set rules (i.e. an algebraic proof). I wasn't aware that De Morgan's Law had multiple steps.  I thought De Morgan's Law was just De Morgan's Law.  Perhaps it means, use two steps used in a direct proof for proving De Morgan's Law?  If that is the case, I find myself a bit lost in determining which two steps to use. Here is my direct proof of the above.  I'm very new at this, and expect there might be an error or three below.  Any corrections for the direct proof below are welcome in addition to this question. Let $x\in$$(A'$ $\cup$ $B'$ $\cup$ $C')$ (assumption) $\Rightarrow$ $x\in$$A'$ $\lor$ $x\in$$B'$ $\lor$ $x\in$$C'$ (by definition of union) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$A$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$B$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$C$ (by definition of complement) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$(A$ $\cap$ $B)$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$C$ (by definition of intersection) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$(A$ $\cap$ $B)$ $\cap$ $C$ (by definition of intersection) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$(A$ $\cap$ $B$ $\cap$ $C)$ (by associative law) $\Rightarrow$ $x\in$$(A$ $\cap$ $B$ $\cap$ $C)'$ (by definition of complement) Let $x\in$$(A$ $\cap$ $B$ $\cap$ $C)'$ (assumption) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$(A$ $\cap$ $B$ $\cap$ $C)$ (by definition of complement) $\Rightarrow$ $(x\notin$$A$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$B)$ $\cap$ $C$ (by definition of intersection) $\Rightarrow$ $x\notin$$A$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$B$ $\lor$ $x\notin$$C$ (by definition of intersection) $\Rightarrow$ $x\in$$A'$ $\lor$ $x\in$$B'$ $\lor$ $x\in$$C'$ (by definition of complement) $\Rightarrow$ $x\in$$(A'$ $\cup$ $B'$ $\cup$ $C')$ (by definition of union) So I guess it comes down to, if the above is an accurate direct proof, what is the algebraic proof that uses ""two steps"" and ""some other basic set rules""?","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"
437840,Proving that a Particular Set Is a Vector Space,"Let $V$ be the set of all differentiable real-valued functions defined on $\mathbb R$. Show that $V$ is a vector space under addition and scalar multiplication, defined by
  $$(f+g)(t) = f(t) + g(t),\quad (cf)(t) = c[ f(t)],$$ where $f, g \in V$, $c \in F$. Since addition defined as such is one-to-one, and since $f(t) + g(t)$ is differentiable, 
$f+g$ is unique and belongs to $V$. By similar argument, $cf$ is unique and belongs to $V$. My question has to do with the eight properties of the field $F$. They are so obvious that I have to question if I did it right. For example, $$f+g = f(t) + g(t) = g(t) + f(t) = g+f.$$
Now, how do I justify that $f(t) + g(t) = g(t) + f(t)$? I do not think that continuity is sufficient, because the proof that
$$\lim_{t \to c} f(t) + g(t) = \lim_{t \to c} g(t) + f(t)$$
already assumes that $f(t) + g(t) = g(t) + f(t)$.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"
