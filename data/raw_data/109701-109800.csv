1581126,Is there standard terminology to describe the not-quite-a-limit behavior of ${\tan( \log x) \over x}$ as $x$ approaches infinity?,"Suppose I want to describe the long term behavior of ${\tan(\log x) \over x}$ as x increases towards positive real infinity. Now, $$\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}{\tan(\log x) \over x}$$ obviously doesn't exist.  So it would be wrong to say its limit is 0. But in some very slightly looser sense, the term obviously approaches 0 aside from the very occasional vertical asymptote.  If you were to pick a point at ""random"" far, far down the number line (I'm being very imprecise here, I know), it would be an $\epsilon$ from 0 with a probability approaching 1 as the random range you were pulling from got larger.  Various summability methods would also make this fact clear. Is there either standard terminology for getting this idea across, or standard notation for expressing it?","['real-analysis', 'limits', 'asymptotics', 'calculus', 'terminology']"
1581146,What is the logical idea of self orthogonality?,"I know how to calculate the orthogonal trajectory of a given family of curves. And it is said in my text book that if the orthogonal trajectory of a curve is itself, then we say that the family of curves is self orthogonal. As an example, orthogonal trajectory of parabola $$y^2=4a\left(x+a\right)$$  Is the same function. But how this is possible? Orhogonal trajectory cut every member of given family normally. I cannot get an idea of self orthogonality. I tried to graph the above equation with suitable $a$ . But I cannot agree with the fact that the same function is its orthogonal trajectory. I try an algebraic approach. If $m$ is the slope of such function at a point $x$ , then $\frac{-1}{m}$ is also its slope at $x$ . This gives, $$m^2=-1\\  
\implies {m=i}$$
thus, the slope I get is a complex value for such functions. But I cannot agree with it. Where is my mistake? Can anyone help me?","['orthogonality', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

1581271,Pointwise A.E. Convergence of Convolution,"The following is a prelim question, which I can't seem to show under the hypotheses given. Problem . Let $f$ and $g$ be bounded measurable functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Assume that $g$ is integrable and satisfies $\int g=0$. Define $g_{k}(x):=k^{n}g(kx)$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Show that $f\ast g_{k}\rightarrow 0$ pointwise almost everywhere, as $k\rightarrow\infty$. It's easy to show that $(f \ast g_{k})(x)\rightarrow 0$ for every point of continuity of $f$. Moreover, if $g$ satisfies some decay at $\infty$ condition like $O(|x|^{-n-\delta})$, for some $\delta>0$. Then we can show that $(f\ast g_{k})(x)\rightarrow 0$ for a.e. $x$ (in fact, every point in the Lebesgue set of $f$). Indeed, sSince $f$ is locally integrable, we have by the Lebesgue differentiation theorem that for a.e. $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
    $$\lim_{r\rightarrow 0}r^{n}\int_{|y|\leq r}|f(x-y)-f(x)|dy=0$$
Using the hypothesis $\int g=0$, we have
\begin{align*}
\left|(f\ast g_{k})(x)\right|&=\left|k^{n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}[f(x-y)-f(x)]g(ky)dy\right|\\
	&\leq k^{n}\int_{|y|\leq 1/k}|f(x-y)-f(x)||g(ky)|dy+k^{n}\int_{|y|>1/k}|f(x-y)-f(x)||g(ky)|dy\\
	&\leq\|g\|_{L^{\infty}}k^{n}\int_{|y|\leq 1/k}|f(x-y)-f(x)|dy+k^{n}\int_{|y|>1/k}|f(x-y)-f(x)||g(ky)|dy\\
\end{align*}
We estimate the second term by
\begin{align*}
&\lesssim\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}k^{n}\int_{2^{j}k^{-1}<|y|\leq 2^{j+1}k^{-1}}|f(x-y)-f(x)||ky|^{-n-\delta}dy\\
&\leq \sum_{j=0}^{\infty}2^{-j(n+\delta)}k^{n}\int_{|y|\leq 2^{j+1}k^{-1}}|f(x-y)-f(x)|dy\\
&=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}2^{-j(n+\delta)}2^{(j+1)n}(2^{-j-1}k)^{n}\int_{|y|\leq 2^{j+1}k^{-1}}|f(x-y)-f(x)|dy\\
&\lesssim\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}2^{-j\delta}(2^{-j-1}k)^{n}\int_{|y|\leq 2^{j+1}k^{-1}}|f(x-y)-f(x)|dy
\end{align*}
The rest of the proof follows by using the $L^{\infty}$ bound for $f$ and the summability of the resulting series to reduce to a finite sum, then appealing to Lebesgue differentiation.","['real-analysis', 'lebesgue-integral', 'measure-theory']"

1581304,"How is this called? (""Syncing sequences"")","I recently needed something like the following: Let $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_m)$ and $(b_0, b_1, \dots, b_n)$ be two
finite sequences of integers, not necessarily of the same length,
with the same beginning and end (i.e. $a_0 = b_0$ and $a_m =
b_n$) and both with the property that the difference between two
successive sequence elements is always $1$ or $-1$, i.e. $|a_k -

$$\min(a_0,a_m) < a_k < \max(a_0,a_m)$$ for $k=1,\dots,m-1$ and

$$ f(x+a) = bf(x) \implies f(x+na) = b^n f(x)$$

In other words, is there a function $A:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ satisfying $A(x+y)=A(x)+A(y)$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ , such that $A(x)-B(x)\in\mathbb Z$ for every real number $x$ ? My motivation: I was thinking about real solutions of the d'Alembert functional equation, $f(x+y)+f(x-y)=2f(x)f(y)$ , without assuming continuity. There was a case where I could show that for some real function $B$ , $f(x)=\cos\big(2\pi B(x)\big)$ and $\cos\Big(2\pi\big(B(x+y)-B(x)-B(y)\big)\Big)=1$ so for every $x$ and $y$ we have $B(x+y)-B(x)-B(y)\in\mathbb Z$ . I was wondering if there's an additive function $A$ such that $A(x)-B(x)\in\mathbb Z$ for every $x$ . In that case, I could show that the solution is of the form $f(x)=\cos(2\pi A(x))$ where $A$ is additive. It's easy to verify that every function of this form is indeed a solution to the functional equation. (In other cases I could show that $f$ is the constant zero function or is of the form $f(x)=\cosh\big(A(x)\big)$ for some additive function $A$ . But they're not related to my question here.) My attempt: I defined $n(x,y)=B(x+y)-B(x)-B(y)$ . So $n(x,y)=n(y,x)$ and $n(x,0)=-B(0)$ . Without loss of generality, we can assume that $B(0)=0$ (otherwise we can subtract $B(0)$ from $B(x)$ and continue). Because $x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$ , therefore I could conclude that $n(x,y+z)+n(y,z)=n(x+y,z)+n(x,y)$ . But this doesn't seem to help much.","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions', 'functional-equations']"

1581420,Conservative Covector Fields are Exact,"$\newcommand{\R}{\mathbf R}$
I am trying to understand the proof of the following: Theorem. Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $\omega$ be a smooth covector field on $M$. Then $\omega$ is conservative iff it is exact. The fact that exactness implies conservativeness is clear.
The other direction is more interesting. I am following the proof given in Lee's Introduction to Smooth Manifolds (Theorem 11.42). Proof. Assume $M$ is connected and $\omega$ is conservative. We need to show that $\omega$ is exact. For two points $p$ and $q$ in $M$, we write $\int_p^q \omega$ to denote the line integral $\int_\gamma \omega$, where $\gamma$ is any piecewise smooth curve starting at $p$ and ending at $q$.
This notation is unambiguous because of the conservativeness of $\omega$.
It is easy to guess a candidate $f:M\to \R$ such that $df=\omega$.
Fix $p_0\in M$ and define $f:M\to \R$ (just a set map as of now, no smoothness claimed yet), as
$$f(q)=\int_{p_0}^q\omega$$
for all $q\in M$. Main Question. To show that  $f$ defined above is smooth. For me it is enough to understand why $f$ is smooth at $p_0$.
We may further assume, by passing to a smooth chart, that $M=\R^n$ and $p_0=\mathbf 0$. So the main question is revised to: Revised Main Question. Take $M=\R^n$ and $p_0=\mathbf 0$. To show that $f$ defined above is smooth at $p_0$. The rest of the proof now goes like this: Let $\epsilon>0$. Fix $j$, and let $\gamma:[-\epsilon, \epsilon]\to\R^n$ be defined as $\gamma(t)=(0, \ldots, 0, t, 0, \ldots, 0)$, where $t$ is in the $j$-th place.
Let $p_1=\gamma(-\epsilon)$, and define $\tilde f:\R^n\to \R$ as
$$\tilde f(q)=\int_{p_1}^q\omega$$
It is clear that the difference $f-\tilde f$ is a constant.
So it is enough to show that $\tilde f$ is smooth.
Now we have:
$$\tilde f\circ \gamma(t)=\int_{-\epsilon}^t\omega_j(\gamma(s))ds$$
where $\omega_j$ is given by $\omega=\omega_1dx^1+\cdots +\omega_ndx^n$.
By fundamental theorem of calculus this shows that $\tilde f\circ \gamma$ is smooth and we get
$\frac{\partial \tilde f}{\partial x_j}(p_0)=\omega_j(p_0)$. What I do not Understand. But I do not see how does this prove that $\tilde f$ is smooth. It only shows that the partial derivative exists. What am I missing?","['differential-forms', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'line-integrals']"

1581490,Simpler proof of an integral representation of Bessel function of the first kind $J_n(x)$,"While doing research in electrical engineering, I derived the following integral representation of the Bessel function of the first kind: $$J_n(x)=\frac{e^{in\pi/2}}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}e^{i(n\tau-x\cos\tau)}\mathrm{d}\tau\tag{1}$$ My derivation, which I include below, is long and ugly.  I am wondering if there is a more elegant proof of (1) using basic facts about other integral representations of the Bessel function, trig identities, and, perhaps, clever integration techniques.  The integral representation for Bessel function (found on wikipedia page ) that looks similar to mine is: $$J_n(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}e^{i(n\tau-x\sin\tau)}\mathrm{d}\tau. \tag{2}$$ Gradshteyn and Ryzhik (G&R) give the same expression in a slightly different form as formula 8.411.1 in the 7th edition.  However, I failed to convert (2) into (1) using simple substitution.  Does anyone have any other ideas? My LONG proof of (1) First, I use Euler's formula to break the integrand in (1) into in-phase and quadrature components, and apply the angle sum identities : $$\begin{align}e^{i(n\tau-x\cos\tau)}&=\cos(n\tau-x\cos\tau)+i\sin(n\tau-x\cos\tau)\\
&=\cos(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\tag{a}\\
&\phantom{=}+\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\tag{b}\\
&\phantom{=}+i\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\tag{c}\\
&\phantom{=}-i\cos(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\tag{d}
\end{align}$$ Now let's integrate (a)-(d) in turn.  First, for (a), note that: $$\begin{align}\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\cos(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n(\tau+\pi))\cos(x\cos(\tau+\pi))\mathrm{d}\tau\\
&=(-1)^n\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\tag{a1},
\end{align}$$
where (a1) is due to the negation of the cosine (and sine) from the shift by odd multiples of $\pi$, or, formally, $\cos(\theta+n\pi)=(-1)^n\cos\theta$. By formula 3.715.18 in G&R 7th ed: $$\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=\pi\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x).$$ Thus, $$\begin{align}\int_0^{2\pi}\cos(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=(1+(-1)^n)\pi\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x)\\
&=2\pi\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x),\tag{a2}
\end{align}$$
where (a2) is because when $n$ is odd, $\cos\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)=0$, making the double-multiplication by zero in this case unnecessary. Now let's integrate (b). First consider odd $n$: $$\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=2\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau,$$
because $\sin(n(\tau+\pi))\sin(x\cos(\tau+\pi))=\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)$ due to the negation of the sine (and cosine) from the shift by odd multiples of $\pi$, or, formally, $\sin(\theta+n\pi)=(-1)^n\sin\theta$ and the fact that $\sin(-\theta)=-\sin\theta$. Furthermore, $$\begin{align}\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau+\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\\
&=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\\
&\phantom{=}+\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(n(\pi-\tau))\sin(x\cos(\pi-\tau))\mathrm{d}\tau\tag{b1}\\

where (b1) is due to the substitution of $\tau=\pi-\tau'$ (the prime is dropped after substitution is made) and (b2) is since $\sin(n\pi-\theta)=\sin(\theta)$ for odd $n$ and $\cos(\pi-\theta)=-\cos(\theta)$. Now let's integrate (b) with even $n$:
$$\begin{align}\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau+\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\\

&=\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau-\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=0\tag{b4},
\end{align}$$
where (b3) is due to the substitution of $\tau=2\pi-\tau'$ (again, the prime is dropped after substitution is made) and (b4) is since $\sin(2n\pi-\theta)=\sin(-\theta)=-\sin(\theta)$ for an integer $n$ and $\cos(2\pi-\theta)=\cos(\theta)$. Now let's integrate (c). Consider odd $n$ (let's omit the imaginary unit):
$$\begin{align}\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau+\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\\

&=\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau-\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=0,\tag{c2}\\
\end{align}$$
where (c1) is due to the substitution of $\tau=2\pi-\tau'$ (the prime is dropped after substitution is made) and (c2) is since $\sin(2n\pi-\theta)=\sin(-\theta)=-\sin(\theta)$ for integer $n$ and $\cos(2\pi-\theta)=\cos(\theta)$. Now integrate (c) with even $n$ (again, let's omit the imaginary unit):
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=2\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau,$$
because $\sin(n(\tau+\pi))\cos(x\cos(\tau+\pi))=\sin(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)$ due to $\sin(\theta+n\pi)=\sin\theta$ for even $n$, and $\cos(-\theta)=\cos\theta$. Furthermore, $$\begin{align}\int_0^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi/2}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau+\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\\

\end{align}$$
where (c3) is due to the substitution of $\tau=\pi-\tau'$ (the prime is dropped after substitution is made) and (c4) is since $\sin(n\pi-\theta)=\sin(-\theta)=-\sin(\theta)$ for even $n$ and $\cos(-\theta)=\cos(\theta)$. Finally, we integrate (d), omitting the negative imaginary unit for now. First, note that 
$$\begin{align}\int_{\pi}^{2\pi}\cos(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n(\tau+\pi))\sin(x\cos(\tau+\pi))\mathrm{d}\tau\\
&=(-1)^{n+1}\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau\tag{d1},
\end{align}$$
where (d1) is due to the negation of the cosine (and sine) from the shift by odd multiples of $\pi$, or, formally, $\cos(\theta+n\pi)=(-1)^n\cos\theta$ and by the fact that $\sin(-\theta)=-\sin\theta$. By formula 3.715.13 in G&R 7th ed: $$\int_0^{\pi}\cos(n\tau)\sin(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau=\pi\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x).$$ Thus, $$\begin{align}\int_0^{2\pi}\sin(n\tau)\cos(x\cos\tau)\mathrm{d}\tau&=(1+(-1)^{n+1})\pi\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x)\\
&=2\pi\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)J_n(x),\tag{d2}
\end{align}$$
where (d2) is because when $n$ is even, $\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)=0$, making the double-multiplication by zero in this case unnecessary. Combining all the terms, using Euler's formula, and solving for $J_n(x)$, we arrive at (1).

1581693,Asymptotics for a series of products,"I am trying to solve the following problem: Define the following functions for $x>0$:
  $$f_n(x):=\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}$$ Show that the function
  $$f(x):=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}f_n(x)$$
  is well defined for $x>0$. Calculate its value in $1$. Study the function $f(x)$ and give asymptotic estimates for $x \to 0^+$ and $x\to +\infty$. Prove that the following equivalence holds:
  $$f(x)=e \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}$$ I am having a hard time proving the equality in the third point. What I have done for now: $\textbf{Part 1}$ Using the ratio test,
$$\lim_{n\to +\infty}\frac{\prod_{k=0}^{n+1}\frac{1}{x+k}}{\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}}=\lim_{n\to +\infty}\frac{1}{x+n+1}=0$$
 the series converges for $x>0$. The value of the function in $1$ is $$f(1)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{k+1}=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{(n+1)!}=e-1$$ $\textbf{Part 2}$ First of all, $f$ is positive for every $x>0$. Its monotonicity is immediate: if $x_2>x_1$, $$\begin{align} \quad \qquad \frac{1}{x_2+k}<\frac{1}{x_1+k} \end{align} \\
  \implies f(x_2)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x_2+k}\leq\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x_1+k}=f(x_1)$$ The general term of the series $f$ must be zero, because it converges; hence in an interval $[M,+\infty)$ with $M>0$ $$||f_n(x) ||_{\infty}=\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{M+k}$$
$$\implies \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}||f_n(x)|| \text{  is convergent}$$ so the series is uniformly convergent on every interval of the type $[M,+\infty)$. $f$ is asymptotic to $\frac 1x$ for $x\to +\infty$: in fact $$\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{f(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}= \lim_{x\to \infty}  x\left (\frac{1}{x}+ \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}\right )= 1 $$ because the series converges in a neighbourhood of $+\infty$. In a neighbourhood of $0$, the function acts similarly: we can notice that $$\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{f(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}=\lim_{x\to 0^+} x\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}=\lim_{x \to 0^+} x\left (\frac{1}{x}+ \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}\right )=  \lim_{x\to 0^+}  1 + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}$$ but $\sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}$ converges in $x=0$ and is continuous, so the limit is $$\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{f(x)}{\frac{1}{x}} = 1+  \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{k}=e$$ hence $f \sim \frac{e}{x}$ Monotonicity and limits of this function imply that $f$ is a bijection of $(0,+\infty)$ in itself. $\textbf{Part 3}$ I have tried to manipulate the sums: writing a single fraction instead of the product does not seem to work: it leads to $$\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}=\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x}\frac{1}{x(x+1)}+\dots=\lim_{n\to +\infty}\frac{\sum_{h=0}^{n}\prod_{k=0}^h(x+k)}{\prod_{k=0}^{n}(x+k)}$$ It does not seem very familiar, even dividing it by $e=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=f(1)$ Another idea that came to mind was to use the Cauchy product series and the Cauchy series product on the RHS : it leads to $$\sum_{i=0}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{i!}\sum_{j=0}^{+\infty}\frac{(-1)^j}{(x+j)j!}=\sum_{k=0}^{+\infty}\sum_{l=0}^{k}\frac{(-1)^{k-l}}{(x+k-l)l!(k-l)!}$$ Things seem as complicated as before. Integrating or derivating $f(x)$ term by term would require to know a general form for the integral/derivative of $f_n(x)=\prod_{k=0}^{n}\frac{1}{x+k}$: it does not appear impossible to find it, but I think it would not be of great practical use; moreover, the series does not converge uniformly on  the whole interval $(0,+\infty)$. The same goes for the series on the RHS . Working backwards, I thought of finding its integral/series on the interval $[M,+\infty)$ : I obtained $$\int \left (e\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!} \right ) dx =e\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \int \frac{(-1)^n}{(x+n)n!}  dx=e\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}  \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\log(x+n)+C $$ I can't get far from here, and I am not even sure if what I have done is correct.

Clearly there are two generators here: a rotation $ \rho $ by an angle $ 2\pi/n$ and a reflection $ \tau $. What I don't understand is exactly how one knows that these three relations as listed are sufficient to characterize the group. When listing the relations, I see that each of these properties are true, but how does one know that they cannot stop with just $ \rho^n = 1$ and $ \tau^2= 1 $, the most basic properties of $D_n$?

If $X$ is $T_1$ then for any $x, y\in X$ with $x\ne y$ exists some open sets $U$ and $V$ such that $x\in U \land y\notin U$ and $x\notin V \land y\in V$. $\color{red}{(1)}$ If you extend this analysis for a finite subset $F\subset X$ you can create a collection $\mathcal{U}$ of open sets where $\forall x_i,x_j\in F,\ i\ne j,\ \exists U_i\in\mathcal{U}:\ (x_i\in U_i)\land (x_j\notin U_i)$. Then $F\bigcap(\bigcap_{i=0}^{n} U_i)=\varnothing$ and $\mathcal {U}=\{U_i\}$ but $\bigcap_{i=0}^{n} U_i\in\tau_1$ due the definition of topology (and remember $F$ is finite). Then: If exists some countable infinite collection of disjoint open sets for the basis of $X$ then if we take some point belonging to any of these disjoint basic open sets then the resulting subspace is obviously homeomorphic to $\Bbb N$ with the discrete topology. If doesnt exist an infinite collection of disjoint basic open sets we have that exist an infinite collection of non-disjoint open sets. If we take infinite countable points each one belonging to a different but non-disjoint open set and cause the space is $T_1$ we have that for every open set at most a finite number of points ($F$ in the expression $\color{red}{(1)}$) not belong to them cause the statement on $\color{red}{(1)}$, so the subspace is homeomorphic to $\Bbb N$-cofinite.

$$\mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}\rightarrow \mathcal O_{X,x}$$
The maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_{f(x)}\vartriangleleft \mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}$ is comprised of the nonzero germs at $f(x)$. These are just the locally non-invertible functions at $f(x)$.

Continuing: $$= E[1_{T \le N} p1_{X_{N} = b-1} | \mathscr F_1]$$ $$= pE[1_{T \le N} 1_{X_{N} = b-1} | \mathscr F_1]$$ $$= pE[1_{T \le N-1} 1_{X_{N} = b-1} | \mathscr F_1]$$ Similarly, I got $$= p^2 E[1_{T \le N-2} 1_{X_{N-1} = b-2} | \mathscr F_1]$$ $$= p^2 E[1_{T \le N-2} E[1_{X_{N-1} = b-2} | \mathscr F_{n-2}] | \mathscr F_1]$$ However, I'm not quite sure that $$E[1_{X_{N-1} = b-2} | \mathscr F_{n-2}] = p1_{X_{N-2} = b-3}$$ I think we have that $$E[1_{X_{N-1} = b-2} | \mathscr F_{n-2}] = p1_{X_{N-2} = b-3} + q1_{X_{N-2} = b-1}$$ Um, am I on the right track?

1582506,"Understanding proof by algebraic geometry, Fermat's last theorem for polynomials when $n = 3$.","This is a followup to my question here . See here . The question is as follows. How do we see that there do not exist nonconstant, relatively prime, polynomials $a(t)$ , $b(t)$ , and $c(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ such that $$a(t)^3 + b(t)^3 = c(t)^3?$$ There is the following answer, the ""better motivated proof where you see that $\mathbb{CP}^1$ can't map holomorphically to a genus $1$ curve."" Let $a(t)$ , $b(t)$ , $c(t)$ have degree $n_1$ , $n_2$ , $n_3$ , respectively, and $n = \text{max}(n_1, n_2, n_3)$ . Then we can define $A(u, v)$ , $B(u, v)$ , $C(u, v)$ as homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ such that $$A(u, 1) = a(u),\text{ }B(u, 1) = b(u),\text{ }C(u, 1) = c(u).$$ Then, by construction, $$A(u, v)^3 + B(u, v)^3 = C(u, v)^3.$$ Let $$E = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{P}^2 : x^3 + y^3 = z^3\}.$$ $E$ is a smooth curve of genus $1$ , i.e. an elliptic curve. Now, define a map $$\varphi: \mathbb{P}^1 \to E,\text{ }(u, v) \mapsto (A(u, v), B(u, v), C(u, v)).$$ This map is well-defined since $A(u, v)$ , $B(u, v)$ , $C(u, v)$ are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree which do not vanish simultaneously. Moreover, this map is nonconstant and proper since its source is projective. As the image of a proper map is closed and it is not a point, and $E$ is an irreducible $1$ -dimensional variety follows that $\varphi$ is a surjective morphism. $E$ is a topologically a torus, i..e it has genus $1$ and there is a one up to scaling differential form $\tau$ on it. This will imply that its pullback $\varphi^*\tau$ is a differential form on $\mathbb{P}^1$ , which is impossible since it has genus $0$ . In more formal terms, a surjective map $\mathbb{P}^1 \to E$ gives rise to the injection $H^0(E, \Omega^1) \to H^0(\mathbb{P}^1, \Omega^1)$ . But this is absurd, since the former is a vector space of dimension $1$ and the latter is a vector space of dimension $0$ . Perhaps you might want to say something about why the pullback of a non-zero holomorphic differential is non-zero. $X$ and $Y$ are Riemann surfaces and $f: X \to Y$ holomorphic differential form looks like $g(z)\,dz$ , where $g$ is a holomorphic function. Then its pullback is locally given by $g(f(z))\,df$ . It is obviously nonzero as long as $f$ is nonconstant. Unfortunately, I do not know any algebraic geometry and do not really understand what is going on. Can anyone summarize/explain the motivation/explain what is going on/explain the key steps/help me understand the proof? Thanks.","['intuition', 'algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'number-theory', 'elliptic-curves']"

1582558,Understanding the random variable definition of Markov chains,"Update This question is answered in section 3.2 of these notes . As a probability novice, I'm struggling to completely understand the definition of a Markov chain as a sequence of random variables. For simplicity, consider discrete-time, homogeneous Markov chains with finite state spaces $S$ which we take to be $\{1, \dots, n\}$.  I understand the following definition of a Markov chain in this context: A Markov chain is a pair $(S,P)$ where $P = (P_{ij})$ is a transition matrix . Given this definition, one can generate a trajectory of the Markov chain consisting of an infinite sequence $s_0, s_1, \dots$ of elements of $S$ by initializing in a state $s_0$ and evolving forward according to the transition probabilities $(P_{ij})$. So far so good -- this is all quite intuitive. However, suppose instead that one considers a Markov chain as a sequence $X_0, X_1, \dots$ of random variables with values in $S$ having the Markov property -- is there a standard mapping between these definitions? In particular, since each $X_k$ is a random variable whose domain is some sample space $\Omega$; $$
  X_k:\Omega\to S,
$$ and since the transition probabilities are usually described as conditional probabilities; $$
  P_{ij} = \mathbf P(X_k = i\mid X_{k-1}=j),
$$ or the transpose of this depending on you conventions, presumably there is a sample space $\Omega$ and a probability measure $\mathbf P$ sitting somewhere ? One guess would be that $\Omega$ can be taken to be the set of all sequences $s_0, s_1, \dots$ of elements of $S$, the random variable $X_k$ maps any such sequence to its $k^\mathrm{th}$ element, $$
  X_k(s_0, s_1, \dots) = s_k,
$$ and $\mathbf P$ is any probability measure on the set of subsets of $\Omega$ that satisfies the Markov property. Is this description of (one direction of) the correspondence between these Markov chain definitions correct and/or standard ?","['stochastic-processes', 'markov-chains', 'probability']"

1582569,"Find all possible functions, $F(r)$, harmonic in $2$ and $3$ dimensions,","Sources: this is an old advanced calculus exam question, which I think is asking for harmonic functions. The problem statement is: Suppose $F(r)$ is a smooth function of $r$ for $r>0$ .

  $$\sum_{i=1}^d (\frac {\partial}{\partial x_i})^2\Phi(x) = 0.$$ Any hints or comments are welcome. So, it appears that this problem statement is just a tricky way  of asking to find all functions $\Phi$ such that $$\Phi_{x_1x_1} + \Phi_{x_2x_2} = 0 $$ and $$\Phi_{x_1x_1} + \Phi_{x_2x_2} + \Phi_{x_3x_3} = 0$$ I.e., we are looking for all functions that are harmonic.  But what is weird about this question is that it doesn't really specify a domain in which we are to find these harmonic functions.  Unless the domain is simply understood to be for all $| x| \ne 0$.
