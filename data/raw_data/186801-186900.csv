3466610,Complexes of coherent sheaves as complexes of vector bundles,"Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety. It is often said that the derived category $D^b (X)$ is ""just"" something like complexes of vector bundles, however I haven't been able to find an elementary explanation of this. I understand that a single coherent sheaf admits a global resolution by vector bundles (since $X$ is a variety and thus has the resolution property) which can be truncated to a resolution of finite length, since some kernel in the resolution is locally free (since $X$ is smooth). However, an object in $D^b (X)$ is a bounded complex of coherent sheaves, e.g. $$
\dotsb \to 0 \to \mathcal F_1 \to \mathcal F_2 \to \dotsb \to \mathcal F_{n-1} \to \mathcal F_n \to 0 \to \dotsb
\tag{$\ast$}
$$ Given a (finite) resolution $0 \to \mathcal E_{i,n_i} \to \dotsb \to \mathcal E_{i,1} \to \mathcal E_{i,0} \to \mathcal F_i \to 0$ of each $\mathcal F_i$ how can one write a bounded complex quasi-isomorphic to the complex $(\ast)$ in terms of the vector bundles $\mathcal E_{i,j}$ ?","['derived-categories', 'algebraic-geometry']"
3466651,The variety of commutative semigroups satisfying $x^3\approx x^4$ is generated by a single algebra,"Let $\mathbf A$ be the algebra given by the following multiplication table \begin{array}{c|ccc}
 \style{font-family:inherit}{\cdot} & 0

 3                                       & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3
\end{array} I need to prove that the variety generated by $\mathbf A$ is exactly the variety of commutative semigroups satisfying $x^3\approx x^4$ . For one direction, it is easy: since it is checkable that $\cdot$ is commutative and associative in $\mathbf A$ and $\forall x\in A,x^3\approx x^4$ , so the variety generated by $\mathbf A$ is in the variety of commutative semigroups satisfying $x^3\approx x^4$ . For the other direction, I am thinking about decomposing any such commutative semigroup into product of smaller ones, so as to show they lie in $\mathsf{HSP}(\mathbf A)=\cal V(\mathbf A)$ by Birkhoff's Theorem. For $1$ -element commutative semigroups, there is only one case \begin{array}{c|ccc}
 \style{font-family:inherit}{\cdot} & 0
 \\\hline
 0                                       & 0
\end{array} and it is clearly a subalgebra of $\mathbf A$ . For $2$ -element ones, I found that up to isomorphism there should be two types satisfying the identity $x^3\approx x^4$ : \begin{array}{c|ccc}
 \style{font-family:inherit}{\cdot} & 0
& 1\\\hline
 0                                       & 0    & 0  \\
 1                                       & 0  & 0  
\end{array} and \begin{array}{c|ccc}

 0                                       & 0    & 0  \\
 1                                       & 0  & 1  
\end{array} They are also isomorphic to some subalgebras of $\mathbf A$ . However, starting from $3$ -element commutative semigroups, it seems hard to characterise types satisfying the identity. On the other hand, the subalgebras in $\mathbf A$ of $3$ elements seem to contain only $\{0,1,2\}$ and $\{0,1,3\}$ . So I wonder whether there is a better way to prove this direction?

3466712,How many tickets should Paul buy?,"An old friend of mine who is now studying mathematics in Germany sent me an exercise from the German Mathematics Olympiads, which was thought for 16-years-old students. Since I used to participate in MO, my friend asked me to help him with this problem. Notwithstanding, I have the feeling that I am as lost as he is. Here the problem! In a lottery, you are given tickets with the numbers $1,2,...,49$ , of which exactly six must be ticked. In the lotto draw, seven of these 49 numbers are drawn. If at least three of the numbers marked on a lotto ticket belong to the seven numbers drawn, the lottery player has won a ""third"". Paul wants to play the lottery and win a third in any case. He fills in $n$ lottery tickets and marks exactly six numbers on each ticket. Determine the smallest $n$ , such that Paul can play in a way that he is guaranteed to have a third on at least one of his lotto tickets. At first, I evaluated the number $t$ of tripels among the $49$ numbers you can choose: $$t=\binom{49}{3}=18424$$ Out of these $18424$ tripels, $\binom{7}{3}=35$ lead Paul to win. Now, every set of $6$ numbers -the ones chosen by Paul- contains $s$ different tripels $$s=\binom{6}{3}=20$$ How should I continue? What's the solution? Thanks in advance and please don't hesitate to edit the question in order to improve language mistakes. Fun fact: The solution did not require to prove that the given $n$ was, in fact, minimal. It sufficed with showing that $n$ allowed Paul to win. Therefore, when it came to grading ( max. $7$ points), the jury did not only take the correctness of the proof into consideration, but also how small $n$ was in comparison to the answers given by other competitors.","['contest-math', 'combinatorial-designs', 'gambling', 'combinatorics', 'lotteries']"
3466762,QR decompositon for singular matrices,"I read in textbook that every $m$ by $n$ matrix with independent columns can be factored into $A=QR$ . The columns of $Q$ are orthonormal, and $R$ is upper triangular and invertible. I don't fully understand why $R$ is invertible when $A$ has independent columns. My thought is: $A=QR\rightarrow Q^TA=R$ (multiply both sides by $Q^T$ , and $Q^TQ=I$ ) If $A$ is not square but has right inverse $A^{-1}$ , then $Q^TAA^{-1}Q=I=RA^{-1}Q$ So $A^{-1}Q$ is the inverse of $R$ . But having right inverse requires independent rows, and I don't see how independent columns are related to it. To clear my doubt, I looked at some other materials, and saw the following statement: Every invertible matrix has a $QR$ decomposition, where $R$ is invertible. As  a  side  note,  it  bears  mentioning  that  this  result  holds  even  if  the  matrix  is  not invertible: Every matrix has a $QR$ decomposition, though $R$ may not always be invertible. It confused me even more. If a matrix $A$ does not have independent columns, how will its $QR$ decomposition be like? As far as I know, $Q$ has pairwise orthogonal columns, all of unit length, and its shape is the same as $A$ . But if $A$ doesn't have independent columns in the first place, how do we find the corresponding $Q$ ? I am stuck and hope someone can help me make it clear. Any help is appreciated!

Also notice that $(a+b+c+d)^{2}$ must be odd and only have three factors: $1, p, p^{2}$ . $$ p^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2} + d^{2} + 2(ab+ac+ad + bc+bd + cd) $$ $$ = 2(c^{2}+d^{2}+ac+ad++bc+bd) + (ab + 3cd) $$ $$ =2(c^{2}+d^{2}+ac+ad++bc+bd + cd) + (ab + cd) $$ So $(ab+cd)$ must be odd.

3466881,"Let $Y$ be a set, and let $f: \mathbb{N} \to Y$ be a function. Then $f(\mathbb{N})$ is at most countable.","Prove Proposition $8.1.8$ : Let $Y$ be a set, and let $f: \mathbb{N} \to Y$ be a function.
  Then $f(\mathbb{N})$ is at most countable. (Hint: the basic problem here is that $f$ is not assumed to be one-to-one. Define $A$ to be the set $A :=$ { $n \in \mathbb{N} : f(m) \not= f(n)$ for all $0 \le m < n$ }; informally speaking, $A$ is the set of natural numbers $n$ for which $f(n)$ does not appear in the sequence $f(0), f(1),...f(n − 1)$ . Prove that when $f$ is restricted to $A$ , it becomes a bijection from $A$ to $f(\mathbb{N})$ . Then use Proposition $8.1.5$ ). Let's restrict $f$ to $A$ . Then $f$ is injective since if $f(m) \not= f(n)$ , then $m < n$ by definition. Suppose there exist an $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n)$ exists but $n \not \in A$ . This will mean that $f(n) = f(m)$ for some $0 \le m < n$ . But since $f(n) = f(m)$ and $f$ is injective $n=m$ which is a contradiction. Therefore, $f$ is surjective. I know that all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ are at most countable i.e. either finite or countable. $A$ is not finite since than there would be some $t \le n$ for all $t \in A$ , but that should mean that starting from $n+1$ all $f(n+k) = f(m)$ for all $n+1 \le m < n+k$ . To be honest, I don't see here any contradiction. However, following the hint, there should be one. Can you help me with this part? Also, can you check the thoughts concerning the bijectivity of the restricted $f$ ? If I know that $A$ is an infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ then I have a proposition $8.1.5$ (page $183$ , Terence Tao-Analysis $1$ ), which says that $A$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$ , and therefore will be countable. From the existence of bijection from $A$ to $f(\mathbb{N})$ it will follow that $f(\mathbb{N})$ is countable.","['elementary-set-theory', 'analysis']"

[And BTW, apologies for possibly not using the correct mathematical notation]. I have a set of $k$ vectors of length $1$ , which I obtain by subtracting a reference point $P$ from $k$ other points $B_1, B_2, ..., B_k$ , and then dividing each by its norm. If the points are expressed as ordered sets of coordinates, then: $$\vec v_i = \frac {B_i - P} {||B_i - P||} $$ All $B_i$ 's are distinct, and none of them coincides with $P$ . Here are 4 example vectors: $\vec v_1 = (-\frac 1 5, \frac 9 {10}, \frac {\sqrt 3} {2 \sqrt 5})$ $\vec v_2 = (\frac 3 5, \frac 2 {5},  2 \frac {\sqrt 3} {5})$ $\vec v_3 = (\frac 9 {10}, - \frac 1 {5}, \frac {\sqrt 3} {2 \sqrt 5})$ $\vec v_4 = (\frac 3 {10}, \frac 9 {10}, - \frac {1} {\sqrt 2 \sqrt 5})$ Question : how to find a vector $\vec r$ such that the largest of the $k$ angles between $\vec r$ and each $\vec v_i$ is minimized (all angles being $\le \pi$ ), i.e. such that the smallest of the $k$ dot products between $\vec r$ and each $\vec v_i$ is maximized ? If I had only $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_2$ , $\vec r$ would be $\vec v_1 + \vec v_2$ , as then: $\frac {\vec r \cdot \vec v_1} {||\vec r||} = \frac {\vec r \cdot \vec v_2} {||\vec r||} \approx 0.868$ Taking $\vec r$ any 'closer' to $\vec v_1$ would make the angle with $\vec v_2$ larger (i.e. the dot product smaller). However, when I have more than 2 vectors, I don't know how to do the calculation. I tried numerically, and I found that, for instance, when I have $\vec v_1, \vec v_2, \vec v_3$ , only $\vec v_1$ and $\vec v_3$ 'matter', so $\vec r = \vec v_1 + \vec v_3$ . $\vec v_1,\vec v_3$ happens to be the pair of vectors with the smallest dot product ( $\approx - 0.21$ ). Seeing this, I thought that only the pair $\vec v_i, \vec v_j$ with the largest angle to start with mattered, and when the vectors are in 2D (i.e. when I don't use the 3rd coordinate) this actually works: I just need to loop over all the possible $\frac {k (k-1)} 2$ pairs of vectors, find the pair that has the smallest dot product, and $\vec r$ is the sum of those two vectors. However, this does not work in 3D. Even in 3D, and including $\vec v_4$ in the set, $\vec v_1,\vec v_3$ is still the pair of vectors with smallest dot product. However the numerical result is $\vec r \approx (0.632, 0.632, 0.449)$ , which gives the same dot product ( $\approx 0.616$ ) with $\vec v_1$ , $\vec v_3$ and $\vec v_4$ . I suppose this cannot be a coincidence, and it makes me suspect that $\vec r$ is always some type of combination of the $\vec v_i$ 's, but I would not know how to derive a formula or method, or in fact if it makes sense at all. The fact that I minimize the maximal angle is reminiscent of linear programming, but then again I have no clue if and how this could be applied here, given that the dot product is not linear. And in fact ultimately my goal would be to have a method that works with vectors in any number of dimensions. Any ideas/suggestions? Thanks! EDIT after some further work Suppose I know that I want to find the vector that has the same angle with 3 other vectors, in this case the ones found via the numerical procedure. $\vec r =(x,y,z)$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_1 = a$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_3 = a$ $\vec r \cdot \vec v_4 = a$ If I solve this system, I get: $[x=1.0254 \cdot a, y=1.0254 \cdot a, z=0.7287 \cdot a]$ Any $a > 0$ gives me a valid $\vec r$ . But then I still don't know how to identify the 3 vectors in a general case, or actually if this is indeed a generally valid method. If it is, I would guess that in $d$ dimensions I need to use $d$ vectors(?). Maybe I should investigate the LP solution Don hinted to in the comment below...

Let $\gamma=1\in\Bbb{Z}_p$ . Let $\Gamma_n = p^n\Gamma$ . Then either by definition or proof, we have $$H^i(\Gamma,A) = \newcommand\fcolim{\varinjlim\limits}\fcolim_n H^i(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n}),$$ but $\ZZ/p^n\ZZ$ is a finite, cyclic group, so on the right hand side,
we should have isomorphisms $$H^i(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n})\cong H^{i+2}(\ZZ/p^n\ZZ,A^{\Gamma_n}),$$ for $i>0$ .
The only reason these would fail to induce an isomorphism on the left hand 
side is if they weren't natural, i.e., they didn't commute with the inflation maps in the direct limit. Thus I must conclude that these isomorphisms shouldn't be natural, since $H^1(\Gamma,A) \cong A/(\gamma-1)A$ ,
and I'm told that $H^n(\Gamma,A) = 0$ for $n\ge 2$ (specifically, I'm told that $\ZZ_p$ is free pro- $p$ , and free pro- $p$ groups have $p$ -cohomological dimension 1). The inflation maps $H^i(\Gamma/\Gamma_m,A^{\Gamma_m})\to H^i(\Gamma/\Gamma_n,A^{\Gamma_n})$ for $m \le n$ are defined

$$ We should be careful about the vertical maps, which are all identical.
The vertical map sends $\phi_a : \ZZ[\ZZ/p^m]\to A^{\Gamma_m}$ , where $\phi_a(\gamma)= a\in \Gamma^m$ , to the map $\tilde{\phi_a}=\iota \circ \phi_a \circ \ZZ[q]$ , where $\iota$ is the appropriate inclusion and $q$ the appropriate quotient.
Then $\tilde{\phi_a}(\gamma) = \iota(\phi_a(\ZZ[q](\gamma))) = \iota(\phi_a(\gamma))=\iota(a)$ . Thus the vertical maps are all the inclusion map. I should point out here, that for an analogous calculation of group cohomology for $\widehat{\ZZ}$ in Local Fields Serre claims that these vertical maps should be multiplication by $p^{n-m}$ . But then every other homology group (other than the $0^{\text{th}}$ ) is equal, and all the vertical maps are equal, so we should have naturality of the isomorphisms with respect to the inflation maps (the vertical maps here). Something must be wrong somewhere. Questions: Where have I gone wrong above? I haven't found a source clearly giving the cohomology groups $H^n(\Gamma,A)$ . Are they indeed $H^0=A^\Gamma$ , $H^1 = A/(\gamma-1)A$ , $H^i = 0$ for $i>1$ ? What should the vertical maps be in my diagram? Did I correctly compute them, or have I made a mistake somewhere? Is there a simpler way to derive the cohomology of $\ZZ_p$ than as a direct limit of the cohomology of cyclic groups? If this approach to computing the cohomology doesn't work, could you suggest an approach that might be more helpful? Edit In an exercise after Chapter XIII, Section 1 of Local Fields Serre indicates that the vertical maps should in fact not be identical. Instead, the vertical map between $i=2h$ or $i=2h+1$ th cohomology should be induced by multiplication by $(p^{m-n})^h$ . I don't see why this is so, but answering this would answer all my questions.","['p-adic-number-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-cohomology']"

3467808,"Is there a formula for ""power integration,"" with integrand $f(x)^{dx}-1$, rather than $f(x)dx$?","I was joking around with integrals, thinking, ""what else can I do to a function (such as $f(x)dx$ ) that results in something I can sum infinitely as in an integral?"" The first thing I came up with was $f(x)^{dx}-1$ . Loosely speaking, since $dx$ is infinitely small, this expression is infinitesimal, so it could be added as though it were a Riemann integral. This may be something new, but I have stumbled across something new, like integration, but defined differently. Similar to a Riemann integral adding up an infinite number of ""slices"" of a function, represented by $f(x)dx$ , this construction adds up an infinite number of these: $f(x)^{dx}-1$ . I'm not sure how to intuitively describe it (like the ""slices"" description on a Riemann integral). It is similar to a product integral in that $dx$ is in the exponent, but different in that the terms of the product integral are added rather than multiplied (subtracting 1 after each term so that the sum doesn't diverge). The notation would be something along the lines of this: $$\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)$$ A more formal definition, similar to the definition of a Riemann integral, would be as follows: $$\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \left[-1+f\left(a+\frac{b-a}{n}k\right)^{\frac{b-a}{n}}\right]$$ Note: since raising a negative number to an irrational power is undefined on the real numbers, the argument $f(x)$ must be positive on the interval $(a,b)$ . There may be a way around this, but I haven't found it because evaluating limits of sums is very difficult when the indices are in the exponents. I have discovered several interesting results from this ""power integral,"" by experimentation. None of these have I been able to prove, but by approximating these sums (up to 500 terms) on Desmos, I have been able to conclude at least some properties: $$\int_a^b\left(\left(f(x)^{-1}\right)^{dx}-1\right) = -\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)$$ or, equivalently, $$\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{-dx}-1\right) = -\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)$$ ""Power integrals"" do not add by their intervals, $$\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)\neq\int_a^c\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)+\int_c^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)$$ nor do they preserve linearity, as a result of the differential being an exponent rather than a factor. $$\int_a^b\left(\left(f(x)+g(x)\right)^{dx}-1\right)\neq\int_a^b\left(f(x)^{dx}-1\right)+\int_a^b\left(g(x)^{dx}-1\right)$$ Examples of some things I tried and their outputs: $$\int_0^x\left(C^{dt}-1\right)=0$$ $$\int_0^x\left(\left(Ct\right)^{dt}-1\right)=x\left(\ln(Cx)-1\right)$$ $$\int_0^x\left(\left(t^k\right)^{dt}-1\right)=kx\left(\ln(x)-1\right)$$ $$\int_0^x\left(\left(e^t\right)^{dt}-1\right)=\frac{1}{2}x^2$$","['integration', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

Define a sequence with initial term: $$S_0=1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}$$ It is well-known that $S_0=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ . I do not write it as such because, in order to describe the next term, we must look at its continued fraction representation. Take every $1$ not a numerator and replace it with $\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}$ to get: $$S_1=\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}} +\frac{1}{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}}$$ Repeat to get: $$S_2=\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac{1}{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\ddots}}}$$ One more time, for good measure: $$S_3=\frac{1}{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1{\frac{1}{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1{\frac{1}{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\frac1{\frac1{1+\frac1{1+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1\ddots}+\frac1{\ddots}}}+\frac1{\ddots}}}$$ We buzz like fat bees to the question: $$\text{What is } \lim_{n \to \infty}S_n\text{?}$$ My almost-solution: Define a recursive sequence as follows: $$\eta_0 = 1$$ $$\eta_k = \frac1{\eta_{k-1}+\frac1{\eta_{k-1}+\frac1\ddots}}$$ Notice: $$\eta_k = \frac1{\eta_{k-1}+\eta_k} \implies \eta_k\eta_{k-1}+\eta_k^2-1=0 \implies \eta_k=\frac{-\eta_{k-1}+\sqrt{\eta_{k-1}^2+4}}2$$ We force the square root in the numerator to be positive for obvious reasons. Now, notice: $$S_0 = \eta_0+\eta_1 = \varphi$$ $$S_1 = S_0-\eta_0+\eta_2=\eta_1+\eta_2$$ $$S_2 = S_1-\eta_1+\eta_3 = \eta_2 + \eta_3$$ $$S_3 = S_2-\eta_2+\eta_4 = \eta_3 + \eta_4$$ $$\vdots$$ $$S_n = S_{n-1} - \eta_{n-1} + \eta_{n+1} = \eta_n + \eta_{n+1}$$ By how I defined $\eta_i$ , we may rewrite the RHS as: $$S_n = \eta_n + \frac{-\eta_n+\sqrt{\eta_n^2+4}}2 \implies S_n = \frac{\eta_n+\sqrt{\eta_n^2+4}}2$$ This may also be obtained by the equivalence (which I noticed visually): $$\eta_k = \frac1{S_{k-1}}$$ For $k \geq 1$ . I omit the proof of this, although it is simple. With this in mind, we see: $$S_k = \frac{\eta_k+\sqrt{\eta_k^2+4}}2 \implies 2S_k = \eta_k+\sqrt{\eta_k^2+4}$$ $$\implies 2S_k = \frac1{\eta_{k-1}+\eta_k} + \sqrt{\frac1{(\eta_{k-1}+\eta_k)^2 }+4}$$ $$\implies 2S_k = \frac1{\frac1{S_{k-2}} + \frac1{S_{k-1}}} + \sqrt{\frac1{(\frac1{S_{k-2}} + \frac1{S_{k-1}})^2 }+4}$$ Which, as $k \to \infty$ , becomes the sum of an infinitely nested fraction and the square root of the sum of the reciprocal of a square of an infinitely nested fraction and $4$ . In theory, this can be evaluated. But I draw my final breath and collapse, dead. More seriously, what I have done is defined $S_n$ recursively, with initial values $S_0 = \varphi$ and $S_1 = \varphi + \frac1{\varphi+\frac1{\ddots}}$ . But I don't know if this converges. An inverse symbolic calculator might find something.

Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on a Hausdorff space $X$ such that $\forall x \in X$ , $x/R$ is closed. Show that $X/R$ is Hausdorff. Firstly, I am not familiar with the notation $x/R$ . Does it stand for the equivalence class $[x]_R:=\{y\in X: yRx\}$ ? If so, here are my thoughts. Take $[x]_R\neq[y]_R\in X/R$ , where $x,y\in X$ . We want to construct $U,V\subseteq X/R$ open such that $[x]_R\in U, [y]_R\in V$ and $U \cap V=\varnothing$ .
As $x\neq y \in X$ and $X$ is Hausdorff, we obtain $A,B\subseteq X$ open such that $x\in A,y\in B$ and $A \cap B=\varnothing$ . My idea was now to set $A':=A-[y]_R=A\cap(X-[y]_R)$ , which is open in $X$ as an intersection of two open sets. Similarly, define $B':=B-[x]_R$ . Then one still has $x\in A'$ , $y\in B'$ and $A'\cap B'=\varnothing$ . Afterwards, for the canonical surjection $\pi: X\rightarrow X/R,\, \pi(z):=[z]_R$ , let $U:=\pi(A')$ and $V:=\pi(B')$ . But this is where I don't know how to proceed. I cannot prove the wanted properties of $U$ and $V$ , leading me to think that this is not the right approach. To be honest, the way I defined $A'$ and $B'$ was rather arbitrary, as I wanted to include the fact that the sets $[z]_R, z\in X,$ are closed in $X$ .","['equivalence-relations', 'general-topology', 'quotient-spaces']"

The method outlined in the book numerically solving polynomial systems with Bertini, is that of randomization. If we have an overdermined system $f=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ in $m$ variables where $n>m$ . We take a random matrix $A\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times n}$ and look at the new system $Af$ . The claim this book makes is that all isolated solutions of $f$ will also be isolated solutions of $Af$ and this is guaranteed with probability one by a simple version of Bertini's theorem. Suppose that $f_1(z),\ldots,f_n(z)$ are polynomials defined on a non-empty Zariski open subset $U$ of an irreducible affine complex algebraic set $X\subset \mathbb{C}^m$ with the property that given any point $x\in U$ , there is at least one $i\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $f_i(x)\neq 0$ .

The setup: $X$ is an affine variety, $f$ a function in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ such that $f \not \equiv 0$ on $X$ . We want $f$ to be invertible in $\mathbb{C}[X]$ . What I have so far is that the distinguished open subset $D(f)$ defined to be $X\setminus V(f)$ is equal to $X$ itself. If we let $X = V(F_1, \cdots, F_r)$ , then we have $X \cong V(F_1, \cdots, F_r, zf-1) \subseteq \mathbb{A}^{n+1}$ where $z$ denotes the $n+1$ -th coordinate. Hence we can express $zf-1$ as some combination of the $F_1, \cdots, F_r$ , i.e. $zf-1 = 0$ in the quotient ring $\mathbb{C}[X]$ , and so $f$ is invertible. My only concern is that $z$ is not itself a polynomial in $x_1, \cdots, x_n$ , so I don't think this final statement actually makes any sense. On the other hand, I believe this is the correct direction to be working in. The 'easy' way out is to note that $\mathbb{C}[X] \cong \mathbb{C}[X][\frac{1}{f}]$ in this setup, after which it is clear that $1/f \in \mathbb{C}[X]$ .

3468467,Theorem 5.9 Rudin's Real and Complex analysis,"I'm trying to understand the proof the of the following theorem: The Open Mapping Theorem Let $U, V$ be the unit open balls of the Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$ . To every bounded linear transformation $\Lambda$ of $X$ onto $Y$ there's a $\delta > 0$ such that $$
\delta V \subset \Lambda (U)
$$ I report the proof, with my questions. Proof : Given $y \in Y$ there's an $x \in X$ such that $\Lambda x = y$ ; This clearly follows from the onto of the statement of the theorem, right? if $\left\lVert x \right\rVert < k$ , it follows that $y \in \Lambda(kU)$ . Hence $Y$ is the union of the sets $\Lambda(kU)$ , for $k = 1,2,3 ...$ . Since $Y$ is complete, the Baire Theorem implies that there's a non empty open set $W$ in the closure of some $\Lambda(kU)$ . I believe Baire theorem is applied as follows:
Since a complete metric space is not of first category it means it cannot be a countable union of nowhere dense, implying that there's $k$ such that $\Lambda(kU)$ is not a nowhere dense, which implies that for such $k$ there's a non empty openset $W \subseteq \bar{\Lambda}(kU)$ . Is it correct? This means that every point of $W$ is the limit of a sequence $\left\{ \Lambda x_i \right\}$ , $x_i \in kU$ . From now on, $k$ and $W$ are fixed.
  Chose $y_0 \in W$ , and choose $\eta > 0$ , so that $y + y_0 \in W$ if $\left\lVert y \right\rVert < \eta$ . For such $y$ there're sequences $\left\{ x_i' \right\}, \left\{ x_i'' \right\}$ such that $$
\Lambda x_i' \to y_0, \;\;\; \Lambda x_i'' = y_0 + y \;\;\;, i \to \infty
$$ Setting $x_i = x_i'' - x_i'$ , we have $\left\lVert x_i \right\rVert < 2k$ and $\Lambda x_i \to y$ . Since this hold for every $y$ with $\left\lVert y \right\rVert < \eta$ , the linearity of $\Lambda$ shows that the following is true if $\delta = \eta/2k$ To each $y \in Y$ and to each $\epsilon > 0$ there's an $x \in X$ such that $$
\left\lVert x \right\rVert < \delta^{-1}\left\lVert y \right\rVert \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \left\lVert y - \Lambda x \right\rVert < \epsilon \;\;\; (3)
$$ I can't really figure how this bit follows from the linearity and our assumption on $\delta$ , can you clarify? I can't also quite figure what's the purpose of the final part of the proof Fix $y \in \delta V$ , and fix $\epsilon > 0$ . By (3) there's an $x_1$ with $\left\lVert x_1 \right\rVert < 1$ and $$
\left\lVert y - \Lambda x \right\rVert < \frac{1}{2}\delta \epsilon
$$ Why do we have $\left\lVert x_1 \right\rVert < 1$ ? Suppose $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are chosen so that $$
\left\lVert y - \Lambda x_1 - \ldots - \Lambda x_n \right\rVert < 2^{-n}\delta \epsilon \;\;\; (5)
$$ Use (3), with $y$ replaced by the vector on the left side of (5), to obtain an $x_{n+1}$ so that (5) holds with $n+1$ in place of $n$ , and $$
\left\lVert x_{n+1} \right\rVert < 2^{-n}\epsilon

Show that every subset of $S$ that is open in the subspace topology is also open in its given submanifold topology; and the converse is true if and only if $S$ is embedded. $S\subset M$ immersed submanifold means that $S$ is endowed with a topology (call it the submanifold topology) and a smooth structure in which the inclusion map $S \hookrightarrow M$ is a smooth immersion. Since the subspace topology is the coarsest topology in which the inclusion map is continuous, and smooth maps are continuous the first fact follows. However, I am not sure how to show that the submanifold topology is contained in the subspace topology only if $S$ is embedded.","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

Hence we have that $\exists x\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $0 < x < \dfrac{AB^p}{(p-1)!}\to 0 $ as $p \to \infty$ , which is a contradiction. Thus, $e$ is transcendental.

The fact that there are two solutions $b_4$ and $b'_4$ is in harmony with our experience. On fig. 1 below are represented 3 given mutually tangent circles in blue, and interior and exterior tangent circles to them in red). Fig. 1. From there, one obtains the radii $r_4=\tfrac{1}{|b_4|}$ and $r'_4=\tfrac{1}{|b'_4|}.$ But the centers $z_4$ and $z'_4$ (we work with complex notations) of the fourth circles are usually computed in a separate way. In fact, the following unexpected formula (obtained only some 20 years ago) gives an easy way to obtain as well the centers of these circles: $$\sum_{k=1}^4 (b_kz_k)^2=\tfrac12 \left(\sum_{k=1}^4 b_kz_k\right)^2\tag{2}$$ (please note the beautiful similarity with (1)!). One can find a proof of (2) with nD extensions by its discoverers in this well written document : https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0101066.pdf As before for relationship (1), $z_4$ is computed by considering (2) as a quadratic equation, this time with variable $z_4$ (or $b_4z_4$ ) giving the two centers $z_4$ and $z'_4$ (assuming that $b_4$ and $b'_4$ have been computed beforehand). See paragraph ""complex Descartes theorem"" in ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem ). Using formulas (1) et (2), I am able to make a certain number of steps by iterating initial step (figure 1); here is for example a second step where 6 new circles have been added to figure 1: Fig. 2.

3469273,A question regarding a $k$-connected graph,"I would like to show several things, some for general $k$ -connected graphs and some for several instances ( $k=2,3,...$ ). First, I want to show that for every $k$ -connected graph each subset $A\subseteq V$ of size $k$ is on a cycle. How do I go on it? I thought to try by induction on the connectivity of the graph ( $k$ ). My base case is for $k=2$ . I take 2 arbitrary vertices $v_1, v_2$ . I know by Menger's theorem that there are two vertex-distinct path $P_1$ and $P_2$ , both from $v_1$ to $v_2$ . By going through $P_1$ and reversing $P_2$ I get a cycle. So this works for 2 vertices. Now I would like to use my induction hypothesis for $k-1$ in order to apply it to a $k$ -connected graph. But I'm not sure how. My intuition is to remove a vertex, and look at the subgraph that was left. Then I know that every $k-1$ vertices are on a cycle. Lets look at the vertex I added $v$ . Here is where I begin to mumble, because I know $v$ has $k$ paths from it to each vertex on the cycle.. But shouldn't 2 paths be enough? Why do I need all the $k$ paths? And where does it come to use that they are vertex-distinct? I was trying to even demonstrate it (the induction step) on a $3$ -connected graph. But it just seems its enough to have 2 paths and not 3... Another interesting variant is what happens if I take a subset of not only vertices, but also edges. This means I have a subset of size $k$ of vertices and edges. Specifically, I tried focusing on a basic case of $k=3$ , and see if I can extend it from there. So for $k=3$ I want to prove every subset of vertices and edges is on a cycle. I have understood that if the subset is only edges, this might not hold, so I assume it includes at least one vertex. My idea is to look at the edge not as an edge, but rather on its two endpoints and then try to show its endpoints, along with the other vertices in the subset, are on a cycle. But wouldn't it be like showing 4 vertices are on a cycle in a $3$ -connected graph? I want to somehow make use of the edge between the two of them, but I am not sure exactly how.","['graph-theory', 'path-connected', 'combinatorics', 'graph-connectivity']"

On the Banach space $ca(\Sigma)$ consider the weak topology (relative to $ca(\Sigma)'$ ) and the weak $^*$ topology relative to $M_b(X, \Sigma)$ . Then weak convergence implies weak $^*$ -convergence. However, it seems to me that sequential convergence in $ca(\Sigma)$ coincides for the weak and weak $^*$ topologies: Weak $^*$ -convergence $\mu_n \to^* \mu$ means $\mu_n f \to \mu f$ for all $f \in M_b(X, \Sigma)$ For weak convergence, it is known that $\mu_n \to \mu$ weakly if and only if $\mu_n(B) \to \mu(B)$ for all $B \in \Sigma$ [Dunford-Schwartz, ""Linear Operators"", IV.9.5]. So, by choosing $f = \chi_B \in M_b(X, \Sigma)$ we get $\mu_n \to^* \mu$ implies $\mu_n \to \mu$ . Is this somehow related to the notion of a Grothendieck space?
