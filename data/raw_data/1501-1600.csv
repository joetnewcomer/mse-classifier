10257,"How much a càdlàg (i.e., right-continuous with left limits) function can jump?","I have changed the title (replaced ""well-behaved"" by ""càdlàg""), since it seems that ""a well-behaved function"" might be interpreted as ""a function of bounded variation"" (rather than ""a càdlàg function"", which I actually meant). Let $f:[0,1] \to {\bf R}$ have a following property: $f$ is continuous except at the points $x_{k,n} = \frac{{2k - 1}}{{2^n }}$, $k=1,\ldots,2^{n-1}$, $n=1,2,3,\ldots$, where $\lim _{x \downarrow x_{k,n} } f(x) = f(x_{k,n} )$ but $f(x_{k,n} ) -

10282,An Introduction to Tensors,"As a physics student, I've come across mathematical objects called tensors in several different contexts. Perhaps confusingly, I've also been given both the mathematician's and physicist's definition, which I believe are slightly different. I currently think of them in the following ways, but have a tough time reconciling the different views: An extension/abstraction of scalars, vectors, and matrices in mathematics. A multi-dimensional array of elements. A mapping between vector spaces that represents a co-ordinate independent transformation. In fact, I'm not even sure how correct these three definitions are. Is there a particularly relevant (rigorous, even) definition of tensors and their uses, that might be suitable for a mathematical physicist? Direct answers/explanations, as well as links to good introductory articles, would be much appreciated.","['tensors', 'abstract-algebra']"
10292,Congruency and Congruent Classes,"so studying for my midterm on Tuesday (intro to abstract algebra). The topics on the exam are Division Algorithm, Divisibility, Prime Numbers, FTA, Congruency, Congruent Classes and very brief introduction to rings. I was reading a few theorems about Congruency and have a couple of questions. I want to know what a ""congruent class"" is. My notes say ""the congruence class of a modulo n"" is a set: $ \left\{ \text{all } b \in \mathbb{Z} | b \equiv a \pmod{n} \right\}  $ which is also saying
$ \left\{ \text{all } a + kn \in \mathbb{Z}  | k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}  $ okay so got that. I just wrote it for some people who might need a refreshed (it is a 3rd undergrad course after all). So in my notes our professor has a following example:
$\left[ 60 \right]_{17} = \left[ 43\right]_{17}$ 1) so the way I figured this out is that to check if they are equivalent, we subtract 60-43 and see if that is a multiple of n = 17. Is this how you can check if they are equal classes? If not, is there a better way to do so? 2) A certain theorem states: Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}_+; a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $gcd(a,n) = d$ then $[a]x=[b]$ has exactly $d$ solutions. My question here is that is x a congruence class or a random integer? What is x and how do I solve for it? 3) Is it true that if we are in $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ then $[7]x=[11]$ can be rewritten as $ 7x \equiv 11 \pmod{12}$? If so, would finding the solution be similar to solution in this question Thankyou. I am just very confused about congurency and stuff. I understand the theorems but I am hoping someone would give me an ""easy"" explanation of what is going on. I still don't know the difference between circle plus and regular plus except that circle plus has to satisfy certain axioms. Am I right?","['elementary-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

10319,Determining Coefficients of a Finite Degree Polynomial $f$ from the Sequence $\{f(k)\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$,"Suppose $f$ is an unknown polynomial of degree $n$ (in one indeterminate) but the sequence $\{ f(k) \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is given. It is a nice exercise to show that one needs only the first $n+1$ terms of the sequence to determine the coefficients of $f$. That is, simply solve the matrix equation $A\mathbf{x} = b$, where $\mathbf{b} = (f(0), \dots, f(n))^{\top}$, $A$ is the Vandermonde matrix of $(i^{j})_{i,j = 0, \dots, n}$ and $\mathbf{x} = (c_{0}, \dots, c_{n})^{\top}$ (the unknown coefficients of $f$). Question : Is there a closed form expression for the coefficients of a finite degree polynomial $f$ in terms of the sequence $\{ f(k) \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ that doesn't involve matrix inversion or differentiation or explicitly calculating the polynomial in question? ( Motivation ) The Ehrhart polynomial counts the number of integer lattice points intersecting a dilate of a polytope and can be calculated by the residue of an associated complex rational function (see M. Beck's articles on the subject). Some of the coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial can be related to an $n$-volume, a relative area and the euler characteristic of said polytope. However, computing coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial is not a particularly easy task. Having simple formulas for them, say in terms of the residues above would be nice to have at one's disposal. A reasonable starting point is answering the question above. Thanks!","['interpolation', 'linear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"
10322,"Multivariable limit $\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac { x \sin(y/\sqrt{x}) } {\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }}$","In trying to find this limit, all the (x,y) paths I check approaching (0,0) produce the same result, namely, the function approaches 0. consequently, I came up with the simplest proof I could that the limit indeed exists and is zero. However wolframalpha tells me that the limit doesnt exist. Assuming I'm wrong, can anyone shed light on where my proof is flawed, and possibly provide a path on which the function doesn't approach 0. \begin{equation}
\lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)}
\frac { x \cdot \sin(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x}}) }
{\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }}
\end{equation} provided $x>0$ my proof: let's take $\varepsilon > 0$ and prove the existence of some $\delta > 0$ such that $\forall (x,y) \in B(0, \delta ) : |f(x,y)| < \varepsilon$ (where f is our function above, and as stated $x>0$) taking the x to the denominator, we get: \begin{equation}
\frac { \sin(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x}}) }
{\sqrt{ 1 + (\frac{y}{x})^2 }}
\end{equation} sin is bounded between -1 and 1, so from here i intend from here to show that i can choose a relevant $\delta$ where either the denominator is large enough to make the expression smaller than our $\varepsilon$, and if not, the numerator is smaller than our $\varepsilon$. We find the relevant denominator bound by: \begin{equation}
\frac {1}
{\sqrt{ 1 + (\frac{y}{x})^2 }} < \varepsilon
\end{equation} which is simply: \begin{equation}
\frac {y}{x} > \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} - 1}
\end{equation} clearly, if this inequality holds, then the absolute value of the function is indeed bound by our $\varepsilon$ as required. so lets deal with the seconds case: \begin{equation}
\frac {y}{x} \leq \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} - 1}
\end{equation} multiplying through by $\sqrt {x}$ we get \begin{equation}
\frac {y}{\sqrt{x}}
\leq \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} - 1}
\leq \sqrt{\delta} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} - 1}
\end{equation} the last inequality is because $x$ is obviously bound by the $\delta$ we choose it should be clear that the right hand side of the inequality is arbitrarily small, although we will formalise somewhat: take $\delta < \varepsilon^4$:
\begin{equation}
\frac {y}{\sqrt{x}}
\leq \sqrt{\delta} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} - 1}
< \sqrt{\varepsilon^4} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}}
= \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
= \varepsilon
\end{equation} without too much formality, we say that for sufficiently small $\delta$, $\sin x \approx x$ and therefore \begin{equation}
{\sin{ \frac {y}{\sqrt{x}}}
\approx
\frac {y}{\sqrt{x}}
\leq \varepsilon}
\end{equation} Of course, I was lazy and didn't add in the necessary stages to prove the approximation will hold in the inequality, although it does, because I can take the $\delta$ to be such that the difference between the sin and the value itself is less than $\frac{\varepsilon}{3}$ and also such that $\frac{y}{\sqrt {x}} < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}$ which means the sin is indeed less than $\varepsilon$ as required. this takes care of the second case. QED (I didn't take much care with whether y is positive or negative, although the function is odd, so we can work with positives and then just prove the result for the negatives)","['multivariable-calculus', 'limits']"

10346,Non-probabilistic proofs of a binomial coefficient identity from a probability question,"Combining the answers given by me and Ralth to the probability question at Probability of getting three zeros when sampling a set , we get the following identity:

10348,Sequences of pairs where adjacent elements differ in exactly one component,"I have a finite alphabet A and a set S of $n$ ordered pairs $(a, b)$ with $a,b\in A.$  I want to find out how many sequences $(a_1, b_1),\ldots,(a_n,b_n)$ there are where adjacent elements have either $a_{k-1}=a_k$ or $b_{k-1}=b_k.$ (Since S is a set, they can't have both.) Any ideas on how to go about finding this?  Formulas, generating functions, algorithms, or whatever you have.  In my particular application I have $|A|=10$ and $|S|=21$, but the question seems general. Also, in my application $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_k,b_k)$ are not adjacent. (They can have, but need not have, one member different.) Edit: For clarification, I'm not allowing all elements from $A\times A$, just those in $S$.  No valid answer can ignore S.  For example, I might have S = {(1, 1), (3, 3)} in which case there are no valid orderings.

10358,What is an example of a topological vector space which contains a non-absorbent or non-balanced open convex set around the origin?,"There are two equivalent definitions of a locally convex topological vector space. Note that since the vector space is topological, addition by a fixed vector x and multiplication by a fixed scalar r are both homeomophisms, which means it is enough to give a neighborhood basis at the vector 0. The first definition is that $0$ has a local base consisting of open sets that are convex (if $x$ and $y$ are in $S$, then $\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y$ is also in $S$ for every $\lambda\in[0,1]$), balanced , (if $x\in S$, then $r x\in S$ for every $r\in\mathbb{F}$ with $|r|=1$, where $\mathbb F$ is either the real or complex numbers), and absorbing (for any vector $y$ there exists a $\lambda\in (0,\infty)$ such that $\lambda S$ contains $y$, i.e. $S$ absorbs $y$). The second definition is that $0$ has a local base given by the ''balls'' of radius $r$ for each $r$ of each semi-norm in some fixed collection of semi-norms (a semi-norm is just like a norm except that non-zero vectors can have a non-zero semi-norm). The two definitions are equivalent in one direction because ""balls"" of semi-norms are convex, balanced and absorbing, and in the other because we can define for any convex, balanced, absorbing set $S$ the semi-norm $f_S$ by assigning to $x$ the ""least"" (infimum) $\lambda$ for which $x$ is in $\lambda S$. My question is: what are some examples of topological vector spaces for which $0$ does have a local base of convex open sets, but that no local base consists of convex sets that are also balanced and absorbing?",['functional-analysis']

10495,Can an integral scheme have closed points of both positive and zero characteristic?,"Background Recall that an integral scheme $X$ is a scheme which is both irreducible and reduced; equivalently, its ring of functions is an integral domain on every open subset. Given any point $p$ , there is a local ring $R_p$ at $p$ , which is given by localizing the ring of functions $R_U$ on any affine neighborhood $U$ of $p$ at the prime corresponding to $p$ .  This local ring then has a residue field $K_p/p$ .  The characteristic of $p$ is then the characteristic of the residue field at $p$ . Question Its not too hard to come up with integral schemes where the characteristic of points jumps around.  The standard example of $Spec(\mathbb{Z})$ has a closed point of every positive characteristic, and the unique non-closed point (the generic point) has characteristic 0 (since the residue field is $\mathbb{Q}$ ). If we don't require connectedness, then the disjoint union of $Spec(\mathbb{Q})$ and $Spec(\mathbb{Z}/2)$ has closed points of order 0 and 2, respectively. However, I have been playing with examples, and I can't seem to come up with an example of an integral scheme that has closed points of both kinds. Can an integral scheme have closed points of both positive and zero characteristic? I would be curious to see such an example, since there is a wide gap in my intuition between schemes whose closed points have positive characteristic (which are inherently arithmetic) and schemes whose closed points have characteristic zero (which are either geometric, or certain arithmetic localizations). Algebraic Version of Question (No Schemes Needed) I should mention, though my motivation and curiosity are geometric in origin, the problem has an algebraic version. Is there an integral domain $R$ , and two maximal ideals $m$ and $n$ , such that $R/m$ has positive characteristic, and $R/n$ has zero characteristic?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"
10516,Counting Lattice Points with Ehrhart Polynomials,"Let $\bar{\mathcal{P}}$ denote the closed, convex polytope with vertices at the origin and the positive rational points $(b_{1}, \dots, 0), \dots, (0, \dots, b_{n})$. Define the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial $L_{\mathcal{P}}(t) = |t \bar{\mathcal{P}} \cap \mathbb{Z}^{n}|$, which has the form: $\sum c_{k}(t) \ t^{k}$ with periodic functions $c_{k}(t)$. Question 1: When is the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial a polynomial, i.e., the functions $c_{k}(t)$ are constants? Does this phenomenon occur only when vertices are at integral lattice points (i.e., $b_{i}$ are positive integers)? Question 2: Suppose I have an Ehrhart polynomial in an indeterminate $t$. What is the significance of the value of the function at rational (non-integral) $t$? Question 3: Suppose I'd like to count positive solutions (instead of non-negative solutions ) of $\sum \frac{x_i}{b_i} \leq t$ with $t$ positive and fixed. Assuming that $b_{i}$ are positive integers, what is the corresponding ""Ehrhart-like"" polynomial in $t$ which enumerates the (positive) integral points in the $t$-dilate $t\bar{\mathcal{P}}$? Does it follow from a simple variable change in $t$ or $b_{i}$? ( Update ) Here is an example of what I'm trying to do. Suppose I'd like to calculate the non-negative integer solutions of 
\begin{eqnarray}
21 x_{1} + 14 x_{2} + 6 x_{3} \leq 1
\end{eqnarray}
(corresponding to the number of positive integer solutions of $21 x_{1} + 14 x_{2} + 6 x_{3} \leq 42$). Equivalently, by dividing through by the product $6 \cdot 14 \cdot 21 = 1764$, we can consider 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{x_{1}}{84} + \frac{x_2}{126} + \frac{x_3}{294} \leq \frac{1}{1764}.
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $\mathbf{b} = (84, 126,294)$, so the corresponding polytope is integral . The Ehrhart polynomial for $t$-dilates is 
\begin{eqnarray}
L_{\bar{\mathcal{P}}}(t) = 1 + 231 t + 18522 t^{2} + 518616 t^{3},
\end{eqnarray}
but setting $t = \frac{1}{1764}$ gives a meaningless answer. My initial impression is that along with violating the requirement that $t$ must be an integer, what I am actually calculating is the number of lattice points in the $t$-dilate of the polytope defined by $\frac{1}{1764}$ replaced with $1$. Is there an interpolation scheme to correctly calculate the number of non-negative solutions of the first equation by finding the values of $L_{\bar{\mathcal{P}}}(0)$ and $L_{\bar{\mathcal{P}}}(1)$?

10646,A space is regular if each closed set $Z$ is the intersection of all open sets containing $Z$?,"I've been trying to prove the following statement, but the converse has been giving me trouble. A topological space $X$ is regular if and only if every closed subset $Z\subseteq X$ is the intersection of all open sets $U\subseteq X$ which contain it. Here, the defintion of regular is that for any point $p\in X$ and any closed subset $Z\subset X$ not containing $p$, there exist open sets $E,F\subset X$ such that $p\in E$, $Z\subseteq F$, and $E\cap F=\emptyset$. The space does not necessarily have to be a $T_1$ space. I believe I showed the forward statement correctly. I suppose $X$ is regular, and clearly $Z\subseteq\cap\mathcal{U}$, where $\mathcal{U}$ is the family of all open sets containing $Z$. Then if I take $p\in\cap\mathcal{U}$, then $p$ is in every open subset containing $Z$. Towards a contradiction, I assume that $p$ is not in $Z$. Then since $X$ is regular, there exist open sets $E,F\subset X$ such that $p\in E$, $Z\subseteq F$, and $E\cap F=\emptyset$. Thus $p\not\in F$, but $F$ is an open set containing $Z$, and thus must contain $p$, a contradiction. Thus $p\in Z$, and so $Z=\cap\mathcal{U}$. The backwards step has stumped me for a while. I take any point $p$ and a closed set $Z$ which does not contain $p$. So $Z=\cap\mathcal{U}$, and since $p\not\in Z$, there exists an open set $F$ containing $Z$ which does not contain $p$. The only observation I've been able to make is that $F^c$ is a closed set containing $p$, and then $F^c=\cap\mathcal{W}$ where $\mathcal{W}$ is every open set containing $F^c$. Hence $p$ is in every open set containing $F^c$. Taking any open sets $E$ and $F$ such that $p\in E$ and $Z\subseteq F$, and I haven't been able to see a way that there exists two such open sets that are disjoint, to show the space is regular.

The problem is, sometimes, my intuition is right and sometimes its wrong. Finding the limit function is the most difficult task I would say. I am able to understand some simple examples, such as a pointwise convergence of $f_{n}(x)= \frac{x}{n}$ over $\mathbb{R}$. But when given complex problems, I am having trouble in guessing the limit function. For example, I had trouble in solving this. Test the convergence of $f_{n}(x) = n \Bigl[ (x)^{1/n} - 1 \Bigr]$ over $X=[1,t]$ for $t>1$. Given such functions, how can I improve my ability of guessing the limit function, and then proceeding to check whether the convergence is uniform or not. One method which I found extremely useful is the following theorem: $f_{n} \to f$ uniformly on $X$ iff $y_{n} =\sup \{|f_{n}(x)-f(x)| : x \in X \} \to 0$. But as I see with some examples, this result is not always successful.","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

Show that $R \subseteq \ker f \Leftrightarrow (\exists F: M/R \rightarrow N)(f=F\circ \pi)$ and that there is exactly one $F$, if both statements in the logical equivalence are true. Now, let's see what I've come up with so far: ""$\Rightarrow$"": assume $R \subseteq \ker f$ and construct a function $F: M/R \rightarrow N$ which works like this: given a $c \in M/R$, choose an $x \in M$ with $c=[x]_R$ and let $F(c)=f(x)$. This works exactly because we know that $(\forall a,a' \in [x]_R)(f(a) = f(a'))$. Now let $x \in M$ and $y=\pi(x)=[x]_R$, then $F(y)=f(x)$ and $F(\pi(x))=(F\circ \pi)(x)=f(x)$ for all $x \in M$. ""$\Leftarrow$"": assume $\exists F: M/R \rightarrow N$ with $f=F\circ \pi$: then $(\forall c \in \{[x]_R: x\in M\})(F(c)=f(x))$. Let $a \in M/R$ and $x,x' \in a$, then $\pi(x)=\pi(x')$. We can then apply $F$ to both sides and see that $f(x)=F(\pi(x))=F(\pi(x'))=f(x')$, i.e. $R\subseteq M\times M$ can be defined as $\{(x,y)\in M\times M: f(x)=f(y)\}$ and therefore $R\subseteq \ker f$. Have I missed something important or is this correct? If so, how would I go about proving that there is exactly one F satisfying the given attributes?

10982,Analogue of rank for finite abelian groups?,"The rank of a finitely-generated abelian group is the size of the maximal $\mathbb{Z}$-linearly-independent subset; loosely this means the number of distinct copies of $\mathbb{Z}$ contained as direct summands. I have come across a situation where a notion somewhat like rank may be useful for finite abelian groups (which obviously all have rank zero). I'm looking at graphs embedded on surfaces and I have a procedure for associated certain finite abelian groups to a graph embedding. I've found that the groups I'm getting this way are all quotients of $\mathbb{Z}^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the surface. So for example, I can realize $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^2$ as a group coming from a graph embedded on a torus, but I can't get $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^3$. Here's my question: for a finite abelian group $G$, define the ""finite rank"" of $G$ to be the minimal rank of a free abelian group that surjects onto $G$. Is this a common notion?

10990,Uses of Divergent Series and their summation-values in mathematics?,"When I was trying to find closed-form representations for odd zeta-values, I used 
$$ \Gamma(z) = \frac{e^{-\gamma \cdot z}}{z} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big( 1 + \frac{z}{n} \Big)^{-1} e^{\frac{z}{n}} $$ 
and rearranged it to 
$$ \frac{\Gamma(z)}{e^{-\gamma \cdot z}} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big( 1 + \frac{z}{n} \Big)^{-1} e^{z/n}. $$
As we know that $$\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{z/n} = e^{z + z/2 + z/3 + \cdots + z/n} = e^{\zeta(1) z},$$ 
we can state that 
$$\prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big( 1 + \frac{z}{n} \Big) = \frac{e^{z(\zeta(1) - \gamma)}}{z\Gamma(z)}\qquad\text{(1)}$$
I then stumbled upon the Wikipedia page of Ramanujan Summation (see the bottom of the page), which I used to set $\zeta(1) = \gamma$ (which was, admittedly, a rather dangerous move. Remarkably, things went well eventually. Please don't stop reading). The $z^3$ -coefficient of both sides can now be obtained. Consider 
\begin{align*}
(1-ax)(1-bx) &= 1 - (a+b)x + abx^2\\
&= 1-(a+b)x + (1/2)((a+b)^2-(a^2+b^2))
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}(1-ax)(1-bx)(1-cx) &= 1 - (a + b + c)x\\
&\qquad + (1/2)\Bigl((a + b + c)^2 - (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)\Bigr)x^2\\
&\qquad -(abc)x^3.
\end{align*} We can also set 
\begin{align*}
(abc)x^3 &= (1/3)\Bigl((a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - (a + b + c)\Bigr)\\
&\qquad + (1/2)(a + b + c)^3 -(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).
\end{align*}
It can be proved by induction that the x^3 term of $(1-ax)(1-bx)\cdots(1-nx)$ is equal to 
\begin{align*}
(1/3)&\Bigl((a^3 + b^3 + c^3 +\cdots + n^3) - (a + b + c + \cdots + n^3))\\
&\qquad+ (1/2)(a + b + c + \cdots + n)^3 -(a + b + c + \cdots + n)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + \cdots + n^2).\qquad\text{(2)}
\end{align*}
On the right side of equation (1), the $z^3$-term can be found by looking at the z^3 term of the Taylor expansion series of $1/(z \Gamma(z))$, which is $(1/3)\zeta(3) + (1/2)\zeta(2) + (1/6)\gamma^3$. We then use (2) to obtain the equality
$$ (1/6)\gamma^3 - (1/2)\gamma \pi^2 - (1/6) \psi^{(2)}(1) = 1/3)\zeta(3) + (1/2)\zeta(2) + (1/6)\gamma^3$$ 
to find that 
$$\zeta(3) = - (1/2) \psi^{(2)} (1),$$ (3)
which is a true result that has been 
known ( known should be a hyperlink but it isn't for some reason) for quite a long time. The important thing here is that I used $\zeta(1) = \gamma$, which isn't really true. Ramanujan assigned a summation value to the harmonic series (again, see Ramanujan Summation), and apparently it can be used to verify results and perhaps to prove other conjectures/solve problems. My first question is: Is this a legitimate way to prove (3) ? Generalizing this question: When and how are divergent series and their summation values used in mathematics?

Define $\mathcal{V}_k$ to be the number of vectors $v$ in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\|v\|_1 \leq k$.

11000,Probability for twelve dice,"In 'An Introduction to Probability Theory and Applications' by W. Feller I encountered this apparently innocuous problem. A throw of twelve dice can result in
  $6^{12}$ different outcomes, to all of
  which we attribute equal
  probabilities. The event that each
  face appears twice can occur in as
  many ways as twelve dice can be
  arranged in six groups of two each.
  Hence the probability of the event is
  $\displaystyle \frac{12!}{2^{6}6^{12}}=0.003438$. The reasoning is that by doing that you're grouping two 1's, two 2's, ..., two 6's (each group using one partition in the multinomial) and the result is the number of different partitions that can be found with that particular characteristic. However, I had doubts about that answer. To understand better that problem, I did a simpler example with $4$ dice instead of $12$ (in this case, the event is the number of ways in which two faces appear twice). Using the same result I get as the probability $\displaystyle \frac{4!}{2^{2}6^{4}}=$ 0.46 $0.0046$. Then, to see if that's true I ran a little simulation of this case in Mathematica: dice = Table[Table[Random[Integer, {1, 6}], {i, 1, 4}], 
{j, 1, 1000000}]; i=0;
f[{a_, b_, c_, d_}] := Which[a === b && c === d && a != c, 
i++, a === c && b === d && a != b, 
i++, a === d && b === c && a != b, i++;];
Map[f, dice, {1}]; After $1000000$ steps I got $69687$ cases in which two faces appear twice. This is equivalent to a probability of $0.069687$. Far smaller than what I expected based on the calculation above. Since this latter example is much more manageable than the one with twelve dice, I did the following With four dice we have the following: Partition $r_{1}$ contains the first and second dice and partition $r_{2}$ contains the third and fourth dice. Partition $r_{1}$ contains the second and fourth dice and partition $r_{2}$ contains the first and fourth third. Partition $r_{1}$ contains the first and fourth dice and partition $r_{2}$ contains the second and third dice. Partition $r_{2}$ contains the first and second dice and partition $r_{1}$ contains the third and fourth dice. Partition $r_{2}$ contains the second and fourth dice and partition $r_{1}$ contains the first and fourth third. Partition $r_{2}$ contains the first and fourth dice and partition $r_{1}$ contains the second and third dice. For each case, we can have $30$ outcomes in which two faces appear two times. For example, for the first case we have $1122, 1133, 1144, 1 155, 1166, 2211, 2233, 2244,2255, 2266,... 6611, 6622, 6633, 6644, 6655$. However, such outcomes are repeated twice (particularly, the outcomes of case 1 repeat the outcomes of case 4, etc). Therefore, the number of different outcomes which produce two faces appearing two times are $\frac{6}{2}6*5=90$. Since there are $6^{4}$ outcomes, we have a probability of $\frac{90}{6^{4}}=0.0694444$, which is the result that produces the simulation in Mathematica. Is it wrong the first reasoning? If so, is there a general approach to use the multinomial coefficient to solve this kind of problems. For instance, it appears that this only happens for $r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{k}$. Otherwise, there are not repeated outcomes.","['dice', 'probability']"

(The spiral actually featured on the cover of that issue.)  Gardner makes the following statement: The grid on the cover suggests that throughout the entire number series expressions of this form are likely to vary markedly from those ""poor"" in primes to those that are ""rich,"" and that on the rich lines an unusual amount of clumping occurs. By ""this form"" Gardner means the form $4x^2+bx+c$.  I'm curious - and a little bit skeptical - about his last statement concerning clumping.  I know that the existence of prime-rich and prime-poor polynomials is a longstanding conjecture, going back to Euler's discovery that polynomials such as $x^2-x+41$ generate unusually many primes, and that Hardy and Littlewood and also Bateman and Horn made concrete proposals as to what the density of primes in such polynomials ought to be. My question is whether there is any evidence, either numerical or heuristic, that there should be a large amount of clumping in the primes of the form $x^2-x+41$.  Famously, the first 40 values of $x$ all give primes, but if one goes to higher values of $x$ are there more long clusters of primes than one would expect if the primes were randomly distributed?

11091,Lights out game on hexagonal grid,"I greatly enjoyed the Lights Out game described here (I am sorry I had to link to an older page because some wikidiot keeps deleting most of the page). Its mathematical analysis is here (it's just linear algebra) Now I just discovered a hexagonal version: http://cwynn.com/games/lightsoutmobile.htm (and hopefully soon) https://sites.google.com/site/beyondlightsout/ Are there any mathematical results for this version of the game, before I dig in and start the analysis myself. I have the major references including Turning Lights Out with Linear Algebra , by M. Anderson and T. Feil (1998). Math Magazine , vol. 71, no. 4, October 1998, pp. 300-303.  It's here (thanks to J.M.). Update: I've been playing with the iPhone T-Lights hexagonal versions. I can get most of them, except for the ones where the ""template"" is a Y shape. Any ideas?","['linear-algebra', 'discrete-mathematics', 'recreational-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
11094,"can I get a bound on the probability of deviation, similar to Markov inequality?","I have two random variables $X$ and $Y$, both receiving values between 0 and 1. I know that $E[X - Y] \ge 0$. Can I get any inequality of the form: $P(X - Y \ge \delta) \le F(\delta,X,Y)$ where $F(\delta,X,Y)$ is a (reasonable) function of $\delta$ and $E[X-Y]$? Markov inequality would be good here, for example, by setting $F(\delta,X,Y) = E[X-Y]/\delta$. However, Markov inequality would require $X-Y \ge 0$, and I do not necessarily have that.","['statistics', 'inequality', 'probability']"
11104,Is $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ with convolution a Banach Algebra?,"Is $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ a Banach algebra, with convolution? I am pretty sure the answer is no, because I think that
$f,g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ does not imply that $f*g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$. However, I can't seem to find a counterexample, or a proof that this is not the case, using Fourier Transform for example. Can someone give a hint?

11113,One dimensional quotients of formal power series rings,"Suppose $R=k[[x_1,...,x_n]]$ is a formal power series ring over the field $k$, what can we say about the structure of $R/p$ if $p$ is a prime ideal of $R$ such that dim$(R/p)=1$. In particular, are these subrings of power series rings in one variable? Motivation: Given a subring of a power series ring in one variable which can be written as, $k[[x^{a_1},...,x^{a_n}]]$ where $a_1,...,a_n$ are distinct positive integers, we have a homomorphism $k[[x_1,...,x_n]]\to k[[x^{a_1},...,x^{a_n}]]$ which sends $x_i\to x^{a_i}$. The kernel of this homomorphism must be a prime ideal since $k[[x^{a_1},...,x^{a_n}]]$ is a domain. Moreover, the quotient modulo the kernel must be one dimensional since the image ring is one dimensional. I was wondering if we have a (partial) converse to this result. (I do realize the second paragraph would analogously work with polynomial rings, but it seems power series rings and much nicer (they are regular and local), so I was hoping for a nicer description of the quotient in the power series case).","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
11145,"How to show $\ell^2_p$ not isometric to $\ell^2_{p'}$ unless $p\in\{1,2,\infty\}$?","Let $\ell^n_p$ denote $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $p$-norm; assume $n>1$.  Now it's well-known that for $p\ne q$, $\ell^n_p$ and $\ell^n_q$ are never isometric unless $n=2$ and $\{p,q\}=\{1,\infty\}$, but I realized recently I didn't actually know how to prove this. I can prove most of it - the only case I still need to rule out is the case where $n=2$ and $q=p'$ (i.e. $\frac{1}{1-1/p}$).  Now of course, it is indeed possible that $q=p'$, because $p$ could be $2$ (so $p=q$) or $1$ or $\infty$ (the sole exceptional case).  But the problem then is showing that $p$ must actually be one of those three. Furthermore I can show that if there is such an isometry, then, after applying a translation and some signed permutation matrix, it must be $\lambda R$, where $\lambda=2^{1/p-1/2}=2^{1/2-1/p'}$ and $R$ is rotation by $\pi/4$.  So actually all we need to do is, given $p\notin \{1,2,\infty\}$, to find a point $v$ such that $||\lambda R v||_{p'}\ne ||v||_p$. Now, graphing things, we can see that in fact any point that is not on the axes or the lines $y=\pm x$ will work; but I do not know how to prove it for even a single specified point, even, say, $(1,2)$, because the resulting equation for $p$ (assuming $p\ne 1,\infty$, of course) is just absolutely terrible, and attempting to, say, determine when each side is larger by differentiating seems to only make things worse. Addendum Nov 21 : I should perhaps point out - obviously the point can vary with $p$, but I have no idea how given $p$ one might pick a specific point that makes it easier to prove - especially since it is after all true for nearly any point! So how is this case handled? And is there by any chance a nicer approach that I'm missing?","['linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
