3131640,Contest math problem about crossing out numbers in the table,"A table $n\times n$ is filled with pairwise different natural numbers. Ann and Ben are playing the following game: Ann chooses the greatest number, then crosses out the row and the column containing it. She then chooses the greatest number from what is remained and repeats the whole process unless table is crossed out completely. Ben takes exactly the same table, and repeats the same process, but choosing the least number on each step. We need to show that the sum $A$ of numbers chosen by Ann is greater (or equal) to the sum $B$ of numbers chosen by Ben. I think it should be done via presenting such $C$ that $A\geq C\geq B$ .
However, if $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the numbers chosen by Ann and Ben on $i$ -th step respectively, the inequality $a_i\geq b_{n-i+1}$ does not hold. So, I am stuck at this point.","['contest-math', 'combinatorics']"
3131672,What's maximum value of $x (1-x^2)$ for $0 < x <1$?,"Since we are being taught about AM-GM inequality, I decided to use the method however I am getting two different answers by slightly different methods. Method 1 \begin{equation}
v=x (1-x^2)$
\implies v^2=x^2 (1-x^2)^2
\end{equation} Using the AM-GM-inequality we obtain \begin{equation}
x^2+(1-x^2)+(1+x)+(1-x)
>4 (v^2)^{\frac{1}{4}}
\implies \frac{9}{16} \ge v.
\end{equation} Therefore the max value is $\frac{9}{16}$ . Method 2 $$
v=x (1-x^2)
\implies 2v^2= 2x^2 (1-x^2)^2
$$ With the AM-GM-inequality $$2x^2+(1-x^2)+(1-x^2)
>3 (2v^2)^{\frac{1}{3}}
\implies \frac{2}{(27)^{\frac{1}{2}}} > v.

3131673,Proof of exponential law using limit definition of exponential function?,"For fun, I tried to prove the well-known exponential property $e^{a+b} = e^a e^b$ using the limit definition of the exponential function, below. Definition. The exponential function is defined as follows. $$e^x := \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left( 1 + \epsilon x \right)^{1/\epsilon}$$ I was able to outline the majority of the proof, however I do not have sufficient justification to go from line $\eqref 1$ to step $\eqref 2$ . What limit properties might be used to fill in the blanks? I'd prefer not to use the binomial theorem or calculus-based argument, if possible (though if an expansion like that seems necessary, that is OK!). Proof. $$e^{a+b} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left( 1 + \epsilon (a+b) \right)^{1/\epsilon}$$ $$e^{a+b} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left( 1 + \epsilon a + \epsilon b \right)^{1/\epsilon} \tag 1 \label 1$$ $$\vdots$$ $$e^{a+b} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left( 1 + \epsilon a + \epsilon b 
+ \epsilon^2 ab\right)^{1/\epsilon} \tag 2 \label 2$$ $$e^{a+b} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left( (1 + \epsilon a)(1 + \epsilon b)\right)^{1/\epsilon}$$ $$e^{a+b} = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \left(1 + \epsilon a \right)^{1/\epsilon} \left(1 + \epsilon b\right)^{1/\epsilon}$$ $$e^{a+b} = e^a e^b$$","['alternative-proof', 'limits', 'exponential-function']"

3131732,Compact subsets of Polish spaces,"I am interested in finding additional weak enough conditions for the following theorem to be true. Let $X$ be a Polish space (that is, separable and completely metrizable), then if $\Omega \subset X$ is bounded, there exists a compact subset $K \subset X$ such that $\Omega \subset K$ Motivation: the theorem is by Heine-Borel true for finite dimensional real vector spaces (so $\mathbb{R}^d$ 's in disguise) and my intuition tells me that if we impose separability, it is not too much of a stretch to go from a countable cover of some kind of extension of $\Omega$ (i.e. $\bar{\Omega}_{\epsilon}$ where $\Omega_{\epsilon}$ denotes the $\epsilon$ ball covering of $\Omega$ and bar denotes the closure) to a finite cover using some kind of neat trick or a weak additional assumption. I am trying to generalize a result I found in which $\Omega$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and in which this assumption of there being a great enough closed ball containing $\Omega$ is crucial for the rest of the argument.

3131741,Confidence that a statement is false,"As a software developer, I have made a program that uploads files one by one to a blob storage in the cloud. After the upload is supposedly complete, a different method will try to verify that the upload was successful, and based on the outcome of this verification I get log statements saying whether the upload went ok or not. Recently, I saw about 2400 log statements saying that the upload had failed. Out of these 2400 error messages, I took 20 random ones and manually checked, but found that the files had been uploaded. So out of 2400 error messages, I found that 20 out of a sample of 20 that those error messages were wrong. Rerunning the verification process is unfortunately not easily done since it will disturb the data, i.e. data being uploaded agin. Therefore I wanted to see if I could use math to conclude whether all error messages can be ignored, but my knowledge on statistic is too rusty. So the question is basically, with what confidence level can I state that all error messages can be ignored?","['statistics', 'confidence-interval']"

3131780,Proper way to find change-of-basis matrix,"From S.L Linear Algebra: In each one of the following cases, find $M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id)$ .
The vector space in each case is $\mathbb{R}^3$ . (a) $\beta = \{(1, 1, 0), (-1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2)\}$ ; $\beta' = \{(2, 1, 1), (0, 0, 1), (-1, 1, 1)\}$ ... Definitions: $\beta$ and $\beta'$ : $\beta$ and $\beta'$ for some linear transformation $F$ , define the basis of vector space domain of $F$ and basis of vector space codomain of $F$ . In other words, for linear transformation: $F: V \rightarrow W$ $\beta$ implies a basis of $V$ and $\beta'$ implies a basis of $W$ . $M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id)$ : Generally, $M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(F)$ for some linear transformation in the book is defined by a unique matrix $A$ having following the property: If $X$ is the (column) coordinate vector of an element $v$ of $V$ ,
relative to the basis $\beta$ , then $AX$ is the (column) coordinate
vector of $F(v)$ , relative to the basis $\beta'$ . I'm not sure about the exact definition of $M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id)$ , but generally book refers to $id$ as an identity map, hence I'm assuming that matrix $M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id)$ is matrix associated with some identity map. Solution: There's a very interesting result in book: $$X_{\beta{}'}(v) = M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id) X_{\beta{}}(v)$$ ( Equation 1 ) Note that $X_{\beta{}}(v)$ implies that the coordinate vector $X$ depends on $v$ and basis $\beta $ . Hence, $v= X \beta{}$ where $v \in V$ and $w = X \beta{}'$ where $w \in W$ , assuming that $Id: V \rightarrow W$ . But considering that identity map is both surjective (it's image is equal to codomain) and injective (trivial kernel), I assume we have $V = W$ and hence $Id: V \rightarrow V$ . According to our equation 1 and basis information, I can simply plug variables: $$\left( x_1(2, 1, 1), x_2(0, 0, 1), x_3(-1, 1, 1) \right)=
\left(A_1x_1(1, 1, 0), A_2x_2(-1, 1, 1),  A_3x_3(0, 1, 2) \right)$$ (where $A = M^{\beta }_{\beta' }(id)$ and $A_1, A_2, A_3$ represent columns of $A$ , considering that it is a $3 \times 3$ matrix). Assuming that $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are scalars, we have: $$\left( (2x_1, x_1, x_1), (0, 0, x_2), (-x_3, x_3, x_3) \right)=
\left(A_1(x_1, x_1, 0), A_2(-x_2, x_2, x_2),  A_3(0, x_3, x_3) \right)$$ This is where it gets little confusing, if I try to isolate column vectors of $A$ in this manner: $$\left( (2x_1 - x_1, x_1 - x_1, x_1 - 0), (0 + x_2, 0 - x_2, x_2 - x_2), (-x_3 - 0, x_3 - x_3, x_3 - x_3) \right)= (A_1, A_2, A_3)$$ Would it be a fundamental error? If not then we would have: $$\begin{pmatrix}
x_1  & x_2   & -x_3 \\ 
0 & -x_2  & 0 \\ 
0 & 0  & 0
\end{pmatrix}$$ Which doesn't seem like a proper solution. What mistake did I make? Is there a better solution to this problem? I feel like I'm making a simple fundamental mistake.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations']"

3131816,Show that the following sequence converges. Please Critique my proof.,"The problem is as follows: Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of nonnegative numbers such that $$
a_{n+1}\leq a_n+\frac{(-1)^n}{n}.
$$ Show that $a_n$ converges. My (wrong) proof: Notice that $$
|a_{n+1}-a_n|\leq \left|\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}
$$ and since it is known that $\frac{1}{n}\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ . We see that we can arbitarily bound, $|a_{n+1}-a_n|$ . Thus, $a_n$ converges. My question:
This is a question from a comprehensive exam I found and am using to review. Should I argue that we should select $N$ so that $n>N$ implies $\left|\frac{1}{n}\right|<\epsilon$ as well?

3131817,Is $P(tautology) = 1$? What are the connections between logic and probability?,"It's well-known that sets are ""isomorphic"" to logic: if we treat $\varphi(A_1, A_2)$ as a shorthand for $\forall x: \varphi(x \in A_1, x \in A_2)$ then $A \land B \equiv A \cap B$ and $A \rightarrow B \equiv A \subseteq B$ and so on. I've noticed that a large number of true logical statements become events with probability 1 when interpreted probabilistically. For example, if $A \subseteq B$ ( $\equiv A \rightarrow B$ ) then $\mathbb{P}(B|A) = 1$ . If you squint hard enough you should see modus ponens there. To connect a Boolean algebra with a Boolean ring you set $x \lor y := x + y - xy$ , and wouldn't you know it, $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$ . That connection can't just (ahem) be a random event, can it? ;-) If we combine some propositional calculus and/or a Boolean algebra with measure/probability theory, can we get some theorems for free? Is it e.g. the case that if $\varphi$ is some tautology then the set-theoretic interpretation of $\varphi$ always has probability 1? Is there something stronger that's also true? I also notice that $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{1}$ , by which I mean the empty set and the set of all outcomes, are independent from all other events, and that I run into problems with Huntington's equation when I set $\lnot x := 1 - x$ and try to make a Boolean algebra over $[0, 1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ , to do particularly with higher-order terms.

I'm modeling two cross-coupled inverters as RC circuits with negative gain. One of the inverters has a source of noise at its input (denoted $v_n(t)$ ) which is a gaussian white noise process.

V_O(t) + \tau \frac{dV_O(t)}{dt}=-A\left(V_I(t)+v_n(t)\right)

V_O(t)=-A\frac{v_s}{2}\left(e^{\frac{t}{\tau'}}+e^{\frac{-t}{\tau'}}\right)

3131986,Examples of transcendental functions giving almost integers,"Informally speaking, an ""almost integer"" is a real number very close to an integer. There are some known ways to construct such examples in a systematic way. One is through the use of certain algebraic numbers called Pisot numbers. These numbers $\alpha$ have the property that their powers can get arbitrarly close to integers, that is: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \alpha - [\alpha^n] = 0$ where $[ .]$ is the nearest integer function. A well-known example is given by the golden ratio $\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ , whose powers are increasingly close to integers: $\varphi^{19} = 9349.000107...$ $\varphi^{25} = 167761.00000596...$ Another example comes from numbers of the form $e^{\pi\sqrt{n}}$ . A well-known example is Ramanujan's constant: $e^{\pi\sqrt{163}} = 262537412640768743.99999999999925007...$ There's another interesting way to generate almost integers by using the numbers $e$ and $\pi$ . By using the identity $$\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\pi n^2x}=x^{-1/2}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty e^{-\pi n^2/x}.$$ we can derive the approximate identity $$ (*)  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{e^{-\frac{k^2\pi}{n}}}\approx\frac{1+\sqrt{n}}{2}$$ which provides a way to construct almost integers with increasing precision: $ e^{-\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-4\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-9\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-16\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-25\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-36\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-49\frac{\pi}{9}} + e^{-64\frac{\pi}{9}} = 1.0000000000010504... $ $\sum_{k=1}^{24} e^{-k^2\frac{\pi}{25}} = 2.000000000000000000000000000000000310793...$ $\sum_{k=1}^{48} e^{-k^2\frac{\pi}{49}} = 3.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000838654...$ So, the question is: is there another way to generate almost integers -with or without increasing precision- by using transcendental functions, as in the previous example?

3132036,direct image functor $f_*$ left exact,"I would have to ask for apology for following question by everybody who is familar with algebraic geometry since this might be a quite trivial problem that cause some irritations for me: we consider a morphism $f: Z \to Y$ between schemes. then the induced direct image functor $f_*$ is claimed to be left exact. the proofs I found used always following argument: We consider an exact sequence of sheaves on $Z$ $$0 \to \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G} \to  \mathcal{H} \to 0$$ choose arbitrary open subset $V \subset Y$ and apply firstly $f_*$ and then the $\Gamma(V, -)$ functor. Since $\Gamma(V, -)$ is left exact for sheaves we obtain exact sequence $$0 \to \mathcal{F}(f^{-1}(V)) \to \mathcal{G}(f^{-1}(V)) \to  \mathcal{H}(f^{-1}(V))$$ at this point the proves end. why now we are done? why is this sufficient? I thought that a sequence of sheaves if exact if and only if the induced sequence at every stalk is exact namely we have to verify that $$0 \to (f_*\mathcal{F})_y \to (f_*\mathcal{G})_y \to  (f_*\mathcal{H})_y$$ is exact in every $y \in Y$ . at that moment I encounter the problem that I don't know how explicitely calculate the stalk $(f_*\mathcal{F})_y$ of the direct image sheaf. on the other hand the exactness for all sequences of second type seems to be much weaker as the conditions for exactness on stalks as in the last one. or are these two criterions for exactness equivalent?",['algebraic-geometry']

3132125,Probability distributions on topologically nontrivial manifolds,"I'm wondering if anyone could tell if there exists a widely accepted theory of probability distributions defined on topologically nontrivial manifolds? If so, as a physicist, I would appreciate providing some explanations using the, possibly, simplest example, a circle $S^2$ . Here are my thoughts. Generally, for a manifold $\mathcal M$ , I see no problem in defining some 'distribution' $f(x)$ with $x\in\mathcal M$ , such that ${\int_{\mathcal M} f(x)d\mu(x)=}1$ . Obviously, this definition is metric-dependent. Still, oftentimes we have a canonical definition of the metric, e.g. borrowed from $\mathbb R^n$ in the case if some canonical embedding is given, which is often the case.
However, we face serious difficulties when try to define 'averaged' quantities. (And in physics that's what we typically want to do). Assume, given some 'distribution' $f(\vec{n})$ , we want to calculate its mean value. One option would be to define it as follows: $$
\langle \vec n \rangle = \dfrac{\int \limits_{S^2} \vec{n} f(\vec n) ds}{\left|\int \limits_{S^2} \vec{n} f(\vec n) ds\right|^2}
$$ The good thing about this definition is that it gives somewhat expected results, especially in the case of sharply-peaked distributions. However, we immediately face a huge number of problems. First of all, there exist a wide range of 'distributions' for which $\langle\vec n\rangle$ is undefined (all the shells whose center of mass is at the origin). Second, excluding such 'bad' 'distributions' from the consideration does not really save us, for such an exclusion may be be 'quantity'-dependent (were we averaging not $\vec n$ but smth else, we would have to exclude other distributions). Moreover, even if we exclude all the 'bad' ones (for a particular quantity of interest), we still cannot even define the sum for the remaining 'good' ones, for, again, the sum of 'good' distributions may be a 'bad' one. OK, let's now consider a totally different approach suggested by the discrete probability theory. What is the mean value for the random variable which in a half cases gives $-1$ , and in another half - $+1$ ? Well, clearly it's $0$ , you would say. But wait, in terms of a 'discrete guy' who only deals with two objects in the universe, $-1$ and $+1$ , this does not make any sense. There's no such object as $0$ in his universe. Nonetheless, this definition oftentimes makes sense. Why? Because we know that both $-1$ and $+1$ have a natural inclusion into $\mathbb R^n$ where the mean value can be defined. Let us stop for a second and appreciate this fact - we allowed the 'mean' value of a distribution defined on the the set $\mathcal S=\{-1,+1\}$ to take values on a different set $\mathcal{S}' = [-1,1]$ . (On the contrary, as of 03/2019, the canonical way of embedding heads and tails into $\mathbb R^n$ is still not known, and, so, their mean value does not make much sense.) Generalising this procedure to our example is straightforward: $$
\langle \vec n \rangle = \int \limits_{S^2} \vec{n} f(\vec n) ds
$$ Which basically gives us a mean value of a distribution defined on $\mathcal S'$ (again, by inclusion). An obvious downside - the averaged quantities have now no meaning for inhabitants of the $\mathcal S$ manifold. Is any of these approaches dominant? Or maybe smth else? Is there a theory for general, more complicated manifolds?

Volume: I can just consider the region $T$ enclosed by the graphs $y=q(x),x=1,x=2$ and the $x$ -axis (instead of $y=-1$ ) because the overlap ( Volume of revolution on an area crossing the axis ), seen precisely in the inequality $|q| > |-1|$ for $x = 1$ to $2$ , means that the solid $P$ from the region $T$ is identical to $S$ . That is $\text{Vol}(P) = \text{Vol}(S)$ because $P=S$ ? Update: Wolfram ( Solid P and Solid S ) says $\pi + \frac{107 \pi}{15} = \text{Vol}(P) \ne \text{Vol}(S) = \frac{107 \pi}{15}$ . I notice $\pi$ is the volume of the solid $M$ obtained by rotating the square $N$ enclosed by $y=0$ and $y=-1$ from $x=1$ to $2$ . Could it be that Wolfram interprets the calculation for the volume of Solid S as $'\text{Vol}(S)' = \text{Vol}(P) + \text{Vol}(M)$ ? Perhaps not because Wolfram looks like it's computing $$\int_1^2 \pi |\color{red}{-1} + (-q)^2| dx = \int_1^2 \pi |-(-1)^2 + (q)^2| dx$$ So, the ' $\color{red}{-1}$ ' is actually ' $-(-1)^2$ ' rather than the original ' $y=-1$ '?

(Note: $f$ depends on finite number of coordinates on $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ if and only if there exist $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and a function $g:\mathcal{A}^n \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ such that for any $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$ , $f((x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}})=g(x_1x_2...x_n)$ .)

Based on some reading, the collection of all cylinder sets is the basis of discrete product topology on $\mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$ . Let $b \in f(\mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N})$ . Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is open. By definition of basis, $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is the union of some collection of cylinder sets. By property of cylinder sets, if two cylinder sets intersect, then one of them is a subset of another. Therefore, we can assume that $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is the union of some collection of pairwise disjoint cylinder sets. My next idea us to show that the collection of cylinder sets above is finite. If this is true, then we set $\ell$ to be the longest length of cylinder sets in the collection. Therefore, for any $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}} \in \mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N}$ , it is sufficient to check for $x_1x_2...x_{\ell}$ to determine whether $f((x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}})=b$ . We can do this for any $b \in f(\mathcal{A}^\mathbb{N})$ . However, I am stuck at proving that $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is the finite union of some collection of pairwise disjoint cylinder sets.

3132224,Does the action of a linear map on $k$-dimensional subspaces determine it up to scaling?,"Let $V$ be a real $d$ -dimensional vector space, and let $1 \le k \le d-1$ be a fixed integer. Let $A,B \in \text{Hom}(V,V)$ , and suppose that $AW=BW$ for every $k$ -dimensional subspace $W \le V$ . Is it true that $A=\lambda B$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb R$ ? If not, can we characterize all such pairs $A,B$ ? Here are some partial results (proofs at the end): First, the answer is clearly positive for $k=1$ . Lemma 1: If at least one of $A$ and $B$ is invertible, then the answer is positive. Lemma 2: We always have $\text{Image}(A)=\text{Image}(B)$ . In particular, $\text{rank}(A)=\text{rank}(B)=r$ . Lemma 3: If $r \ge k$ or $r \le d-k$ , then $\ker(A)=\ker(B) $ . In particular, the above lemmas imply that if $r>k$ , then the answer is positive. Indeed, in that case, the kernels and images coincide, so we  can consider the quotient operators: $\tilde A,\tilde B:V/D \to H$ , where $D$ is the kernel, and $H$ is the image. Now $\tilde A, \tilde B$ are invertible operators between $r$ -dimensional spaces, and they satisfy the assumption for $k<r$ . Thus, by lemma 1, $\tilde A=\lambda \tilde B$ , which implies $ A=\lambda B$ . Edit: Here is a slick proof that the answer is positive in general: Let $v\in V$ and let $X(v)$ be the collection of $k$ -dimensional subspaces of $V$ that contain $v$ . Then $$\text{span} \{v\}=\bigcap_{W\in X(v)}W,$$ so $$A(\text{span} \{v\})=A(\bigcap_{W\in X(v)}W) \subseteq \bigcap_{W\in X(v)}AW=\bigcap_{W\in X(v)}BW \subseteq B(\text{span} \{v\}),$$ where the last containment follows from this answer . 
This reduces the problem to the case where $k=1$ . Proof of Lemma 1: Suppose that $A$ is invertible. Then, we have $SW=W$ , where $S=A^{-1}B$ . Thus, every $k$ -dimensional subspace is $S$ -invariant, which implies $S$ is a multiple of the identity. Proof of Lemma 2: $\text{Image}(A)=\text{Image}(B)$ . Let $x=Av_1 \in \text{Image}(A)$ ; complete $v_1$ to a linearly independent set $v_1,\dots,v_k$ .  Then $$ x \in A(\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\})=B(\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\})\subseteq \text{Image}(B),$$ so $\text{Image}(A) \subseteq \text{Image}(B)$ . The other direction follows by symmetry. Proof of Lemma 3: If $r \ge k$ or $r \le d-k$ , then $\ker(A)=\ker(B) $ . First, suppose that $r \ge k$ , and let $v_1 \notin \ker A$ . Complete $v_1$ into a linearly independent set $v_1,\dots,v_k$ such that $A(\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\})$ is $k$ -dimensional. Then $B(\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\})$ is $k$ -dimensional, so $Bv_1 \neq 0$ . This shows $\ker(A)^c \subseteq \ker(B)^c$ , i.e. $\ker(B)\subseteq \ker(A)$ . The other direction follows by symmetry. Now, suppose that $r \le d-k$ . Then, since the nullity is $\ge k$ , every $v_1 \in \ker B$ can be completed into a linearly independent set $v_1,\dots,v_k$ , all in $\ker B$ . This implies that $A(\text{span}\{v_1,\dots,v_k\})=0$ , so $v_1 \in \ker A$ .","['grassmannian', 'invariant-subspace', 'linear-algebra', 'linear-transformations', 'symmetry']"

If I want to construct a smooth projection map $tan:\mathfrak X(M) \rightarrow \mathfrak X(H) $ , one way is to use a Riemannian metric (whose existence is well known) to construct one (see [1] below). I want to understand this in a different way if possible. Pointwise, I see the following happening: At any point $p \in H$ , consider $T_{\phi(p)}M$ . Now, $\phi'(T_pH)$ is a linear subspace of $T_{\phi(p)}M$ . By injectivity of $\phi'$ , it is clear that $T_pH\cong \phi'(T_pH) $ . Further, by standard linear algebra arguments and the definition of normal bundle, and above, one can easily say that: $$T_{\phi(p)}M \cong T_pH\oplus N_pH$$ Use the standard projectors $pr_i$ of the direct sum to  construct the projector of the vector field as $$(tan(X))(p)=(\phi')^{-1}\circ pr_1(X(\phi(p)))$$ Ofcourse, the key caveat here is that we want the map to be smooth [2], and the problematic part is the $pr_1$ above. Now, I do not expect this map to be smooth, but I can't think of a counterexample to show that the above map is not smooth either. [1] I know that given a Riemannian structure $g$ on $M$ , one can induce one on $H$ as $h:=\phi^*g$ . This yields a very natural smooth projection map as $tan:=h^\sharp \circ \phi^* \circ g^\flat$ . But I am not interested in this.

Why is there an $\eta\in (0,1)$ with $F(\eta)>0$ ? Am I right that $F(0)=0$ and $F(1)>0$ ; if yes then this implies the existence of such an $\eta$ (Intermediate value theorem?) 2.) Where does the condition $0<\nu<(2 F(\eta))^{1/2}$ come from? From the energy picture, it is clear to me that by assumption $\int_0^1 f(u)\, du=F(1)-F(0)>0$ , we have that there are to hill tops positioned at $U=0, F(0)$ and $U=1, F(1)$ and that the second hill top is higher than the first one. Hence, from the phase plane it is clear to me that there are trajectories through $(u,0)$ and $(0,-v)$ for $u\approx 1$ and some $v>0$ . I think the condition $0<\nu <(2 F(\eta))^{1/2}$ has something to do with this energy picture. Edit. My idea would be to use $$
E(U,V)=C \Leftrightarrow V=\pm\sqrt{2C-2F(U)}
$$ which makes sense iff $F(U)\leqslant C$ . If we choose $C=F(\eta)$ then for $0<F(U)<F(\eta)$ we have $$

Define, $\Sigma$ as the set of all functions $f$ from $FT$ to $\mathbb{Z}$ , such that $f(E) = 1$ , where $E$ is the trivial group. Now, if $f, g \in \Sigma$ , define $$(f \ast g) (G)= \Sigma_{H \triangleleft G} f(H)g(\frac{G}{H}).$$ It is not hard to see, that $(\Sigma, \ast)$ is a group: $f \ast (g \ast h) = \Sigma_{K \triangleleft H \triangleleft G} f(K)g(\frac{H}{K})h(\frac{G}{H}) = (f \ast g) \ast h$ The function $e$ , such that $e(E) = 1$ and $e(G) = 0$ for any non-trivial $G$ , is the identity element. The inverse to $f$ is the function $f^{-1}$ satisfying the recurrent relation $\Sigma_{H \triangleleft G} f(H)f^{-1}(\frac{G}{H}) = 0$ and $f^{-1}(E) = 1$ . Moreover, it is quite easy to prove that this group is torsion-free: Suppose $f \in \Sigma$ , $G$ is the nontrivial group of minimal order, such that $f(G) \neq 0$ . Then $\forall H \triangleleft G$ if $H \neq G$ and $H \neq E$ , then $f(H) = 0$ (as $|H| \leq |G|$ ). Then $f^n(G) = f(G) + f^{n-1}(G) = nf(G) \neq 0$ . That means $\forall n \in \mathbb(N)  f^n \neq e$ Personally, I think that this group is also very likely to be centerless, but the only thing I managed to prove in this direction was «If $f \in Z(\Sigma)$ and $G$ is simple, then $f(G) = 0$ »: Define $g_H \in \Sigma$ as a function, such that $g(H) = 1$ and $G(K) = 0$ for all non-trivial groups $K$ non-isomorphic to $H$ .
If $G \cong C_2$ , then $0 = g_{C_3} \ast f (S_3) - f  \ast g_{C_3} (S_3) = f(S_3) + f(C_2) - f(S_3) = f(C_2)$ .
If $G$ is simple, but not isomorphic to $C_2$ , then it has an automorphism $a$ of order $2$ . So $ 0 = f \ast g_{C_2} (G \rtimes \langle a \rangle) - g_{C_2} \ast f (G \rtimes \langle a \rangle) = f(G \rtimes \langle a \rangle) + f(G) - f(G \rtimes \langle a \rangle) = f(G)$ .

At this point the signal will undergo a considerable change. In topology it is shown that it is not possible to map a region of higher dimension into a region of lower dimension continuously . It is the necessary discontinuity which produces the threshold effects we have been describing for communication systems. Emphasis is Shannon's.

From the condition that $\beta'(z)$ is strictly positive and that we want a unique solution, I deduced that our energy probably has an expression for the anti-derivative of $\beta$ to make the energy strictly convex.

Anyways, I'll start with what I have right now. Let $x$ be a positive integer such that $x > 1$ .
Let $y$ be a prime such that $y > x$ . Then, $x$ is either prime or not prime. In case it's prime, clearly $gcd(x,y)=1$ . Since $x! = x*(x-1)...1$ and $ x \ge (x-1) \ge (x-2) ... \ge 1$ . So each factor of the factorial is smaller than $y$ and has no common factor with it (for $y$ is prime). Hence, $x!$ has no common divisors with $y$ besides 1, from which follows $gcd(x!,y)=1$ . Assuming $x$ to be not prime. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $x$ can be written as a product of primes $\mathrm{p_1}^{a_1}$ $\mathrm{p_2}^{a_2}$ ... $\mathrm{p_n}^{a_n}$ . We know that any $\mathrm{p_i}^{a_i} \le y$ thus having no common factors with $y$ annd $gcd(x,y)=1$ .

3133433,"$\sqrt{|xy|}$ verifies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at $(0,0)$, but is not differentiable at $(0,0)$","Show that the function $f(z)=\sqrt{|xy|}$ verifies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at point zero, but it is not differentiable at that point. $u(x,y)=\sqrt{|xy|}$ and $v(x,y)=0$ since the imaginary part of the function is zero. $\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial x}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}\\\frac{\partial v(x,y)}{\partial y}=0$ $\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial y}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}\\\frac{\partial v(x,y)}{\partial x}=0$ $\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}}=0\\
\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}}=0\end{cases},$ Its solution should be (0,0) but $\frac{0}{0}$ is not determined. Then to check it is not differentiable at point (0,0) I used the derivative definition: $\lim_{z\to 0}\frac{f(z)-f(0)}{z-0}=\frac{\sqrt{|xy|-0}}{x-0+i(y-0)}=\frac{0}{0}$ again not determined. Questions : Is my solution right? According to the question the function should verify the Cauchy-Riemann equations however it does not seem so. What am I doing wrong on that part?

3133442,All idempotents splits in set theory context,"So I wanted to show that in the category $\mathbf{SET}$ , all idempotent splits.
Fix an idempotent $f$ , I wish to find 2 arrows $g,h$ such that $f=hg$ and $gh = 1$ . I'm having some trouble ""decomposing"" such an $f$ . However what I did notice is that if I can find an injective $h$ and a surjective $g$ , then $gh = 1$ is fulfilled automatically since $f^2 = f \rightarrow hghg = hg 
\\ \rightarrow ghg = g\ \text{ (Since h is injective hence monic in Set)} \\ \rightarrow gh = 1\ (\ \text{Since g is surjective, hence an epi in Set})$ So how can I decompose an idempotent $f$ into an injective and surjective component ?

The main problem I have is that in order to link $f$ and it's derivative I only know that : $f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + o(x)$ in a neighboorhhod of $a$ . Yet this formula is not precise at all and only usefull to compute limit. The $o(x)$ term makes it impossible to manipulate/do $\epsilon$ proofs. So is there a way to have a precise formula that link $f$ and it's derivative so that it's more suitable for $\epsilon$ proof ? For example let's consider the following : Let $f \in C^1(\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{R})$ . Moreover we know that on $[a,b]$ $\inf \mid f' \mid = K$ then prove that $\mid f\mid \geq  Kx $ on $[a,b]$ This is intuitively obvious. Yet using the formula $f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) +o(x)$ doesn't help at all since it's only an asymptotic.

3133684,Proof of Baby Rudin Theorem 2.43,"I came up with the following fleshed out proof of Theorem 2.43 from Principles of Mathematical Analysis. Although this is a duplicate of several other questions, I found many of the other proofs of 2.43 on StackExchange verbose or unclear (and I didn't see this proof covered in the Harvey Mudd or Scripps YouTube lectures), so I hope that this version of the proof can serve as a more helpful reference to anyone else who gets stuck. At the same time, I'm not confident that my reasoning is sound, so I hope that if there are any major flaws or oversights in my proof that a critical reader can point them out, or confirm that I'm correct about property (iii). Theorem 2.43 Let $P$ be a nonempty perfect set in $\mathbb{R}^k$ . Then $P$ is uncountable. Proof : Since $P$ is non-empty, and every point of $P$ is a limit point, $P$ contains at least one limit point. Hence, $P$ is infinite (by 2.20). Suppose $P$ is countable and denote the points of $P$ by $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots$ We can construct a sequence $\{V_n\}$ of neighborhoods as follows: Let $V_1$ be any neighborhood of $x_1$ . Then $V_1 \cap P$ is non-empty, because $x_1$ is a limit point of $P$ . If $V_1$ consists of all $y \in \mathbb{R}^k$ such that $|y-x_1| < r$ , the closure $\overline{V_1}$ of $V_1$ is $\{y | |y-x_1| \le r\}$ (note: I will not prove this rigorously, but see Lemma 1 below for a sketch of the proof). Suppose $V_n$ has been constructed so that $V_n \cap P$ is not empty and $V_n = N_r(p)$ for some $p \in P$ . Since every point of $P$ is a limit point of $P$ , there is a neighborhood $V_{n+1}$ such that (i) $\overline{V_{n+1}} \subset V_n$ , (ii) $x_n \not \in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ , (iii) $V_{n+1} \cap P$ is not empty, and $V_{n+1} = N_r(p)$ for some point in $P$ . By (iii), $V_{n+1}$ satisfies our induction hypothesis, and the construction can proceed. We now show how we can always construct such a neighborhood $V_{n+1}$ . Let's say that $V_n = N_{r_n}(p_n)$ for some $p_n \in P$ . Just a quick note: it's a common point of confusion that people believe that $x_n$ must be in $V_n$ . While $x_1 \in V_1$ , we cannot assume that this holds true for any other $x_n$ , and at no point does the proof assume this (or need to assume this). Let $p_{n+1}$ be some point in $V_n \cap P$ , such that (a.) $p_{n+1} \not = p_{n}$ ,  (b.) $p_{n+1} \not = x_n$ , and (c.) $p_{n+1} \not = x_{n+1}$ . It follows from Lemmas 2 and 3 that such a point exists. Lemma 2: For $n>1$ , there exists some point $q \in V_n \cap P,$ such that $q \not = p_n$ , and such that $d(p_n, q) < d(p_n, x_n)$ and $d(p_n, q) < d(p_n, x_{n+1})$ . Suppose not. Note that for $n > 1$ , we have that $p_n \not = x_n$ and $p_n \not = x_{n+1}$ (by our choice of $p_n$ ). Therefore, $d(p_n, x_n) > 0$ and $d(p_n, x_{n+1}) > 0$ . So there is some neighborhood of $p_n$ (namely, the neighborhood with radius $r = d(p_n, x)$ , where $x \in \{x_n, x_{n+1}\}$ ) such that the only point of that neighborhood in $P$ is the point $p_n$ , which contradicts our assumption that $p_n$ is a limit point of $P$ . Lemma 3: For $n=1$ , there exists some point $q \in V_1 \cap P,$ such that $q \not = p_1$ , $d(p_1, q) < d(p_1, x_2)$ . Suppose not. Note that $p_1 = x_1$ . Therefore, $d(p_1, x_2) = d(x_1, x_2) > 0$ . So there is some neighborhood of $p_n$ (namely, the neighborhood with radius $r = d(p_1, x_2))$ , such that the only point of that neighborhood in $P$ is the point $p_1$ , which contradicts our assumption that $p_1$ is a limit point of $P$ . Let $V_{n+1} = N_{r_{n+1}}(p_{n+1})$ with $r_{n+1}$ chosen subject to the following conditions. (1.) $r_{n+1} \le d(p_{n+1}, x_n)$ , and (2.) $r_{n+1} < r_n - d(p_n, p_{n+1})$ . By our choice of $p_{n+1}, r_{n+1}$ , and $V_{n+1} = N_{r_{n+1}}(p_{n+1})$ we have the following: (I) $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (i) : If $y \in \overline{V_{n+1}}$ , then $d(p_n, y)$ $\le d(p_n, p_{n+1}) + d(p_{n+1}, y)$ [by the properties of a metric space] $\le d(p_n, p_{n+1}) + r_{n+1}$ $< d(p_n, p_{n+1}) + r_n - d(p_n, p_{n+1})$ [by our choice of $r_{n+1}]$ $= r_n$ . Thus, $y \in V_n$ . Hence, $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (i). (II) $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (ii) : If $y \in V_{n+1}$ , then $d(p_n, y) < r_{n+1} \le d(p_{n+1}, x_n)$ . Thus, $x_n \not \in V_{n+1}$ . Hence, $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (ii). (III) $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (iii) : Because $p_{n+1}$ was chosen to be in $P$ , we have that $N_r(p_{n+1}) \cap P$ is non-empty for all neighborhoods of $p_{n+1}$ . Thus, $V_{n+1}$ satisfies (iii). Let $K_n = \overline{V_n} \cap P$ . Since $\overline{V_n}$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R^k}$ , $\overline{V_n}$ is compact (by 2.41). $P$ is closed (because $P$ is perfect). Thus, $\overline{V_n} \cap P$ is closed (by 2.24(b)). Hence $K_n$ is compact (by 2.35, because $K_n$ is a closed subset of a compact set). Since $x_n \not \in K_{n+1}$ , no point of $P$ lies in $\cap_{1}^{\infty} K_n$ (this is implied by the fact that $P$ is countable, hence for every $x_i \in P$ , there is a $K_{i+1}$ that excludes $x_i$ from $\cap_{1}^{\infty} K_n$ ). But $K_n \subset P$ , so this implies that $\cap_{1}^{\infty} K_n$ is empty. But each $K_n$ is nonempty (by (iii), and $K_n \supset K_{n+1}$ (by (i)). But this contradicts the corollary to 2.36. The theorem follows. Lemma 1: $y$ is a limit point of $V_1$ if and only if $|y - x_1| = r$ or $y \in V_1$ . Proof Sketch: suppose $|y - x_1| > r$ . Then $|y - x_1| = r + \epsilon$ for some $\epsilon > 0$ . So $N_{\epsilon/2}(y) \cap V_1 = \emptyset$ and $y$ is not a limit point of $V_1$ . Now suppose $|y - x_1| = r$ . Then every neighborhood of $y$ contains a point in $V_1$ , so $y$ is a limit point of $V_1$ ).","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"
