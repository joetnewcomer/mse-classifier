Then, $ \abs{a_nz^n} = \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_k z^k - \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a_kz^k} \leq \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_k z^k} + \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a_kz^k} $ by the triangle inequality. Let $ M \gt 0, \exists R \in \mathbb{R} \text{ s.t. } \abs{z} \gt R \implies M \lt \abs{a_n z^n} $ since it is known that $ \abs{a_n z^n} $ converges to infinity. So by choose such and R as above and choosing a sufficiently large z, you get: $ M \lt \abs{a_n z^n} \leq \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_k z^k} + \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a_kz^k} \implies M - \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a_kz^k} \lt \abs{\sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_k z^k} $ However, this is not sufficient to prove the hypothesis and I am at a loss of what to do.

I just need the practical way to calculate the smallest angle between two lines that intersect. The value, of course, must always be less than or equal to 90 º. For ease, imagine the hands of a clock as line segments, starting from a common vertex at its center. At 12 o'clock we have 0° and 360°, at 3 o'clock we have 90, at 6 o'clock we have 180, at 9 am have 270, ie, the angles range from 0 to 360° clockwise ALWAYS. This is my reference. Each hour is 30 degrees (360/12), so suppose one of hands is in position 1h and the other one is in position 11h. Using my reference, which always starts at zero from 0 hours (or 12 hours, whichever you prefer) we have: 1h Position is equivalent to 30°
11h position is equivalent to 330° I know, looking at the clock, the result I hope to find is 60°, however I need a mathematical relationship where I tell two angles starting from the same source and I get as result a value that is the smallest angle by two intersecting lines. OBS.: I really do not need explanations about lines in Cartesian planes or angular coefficient. I really do not have these informations. What I have are only two angles relative to each other to form imaginary lines and I need only calculate the smallest angle between these lines.

341895,"The real line has cardinality at most $\aleph_2$, but transfinite ordinal space has arbitrarily high cardinality: what is wrong?","In the context of supertasks, people and mathematicians are comfortable with the idea of transfinite ordinal time, that is, that time can be divided into an arbitrarily high number of steps. In most cases the number of steps is limited to be $\omega$, but some models, such as Hamkins infinite time Turing machines, assume that a finite amount of time  can be divided into a number of steps of arbitrarily high cardinality. I think we can safely extend the concept from time to space (actually the question is the same, just that I think many people will find it easier to identify space with the real line).  Then, the original question: The real line has $2^{\aleph_0}$ (which I guess is at most  $\aleph_2$) points. But if we can partition it into a number of intervals of arbitrarily high cardinality, shouldn't the number (or set) of points on it have at least the same cardinality?

If $ f:M \rightarrow R^3 $ is a minimal immersion then the conjecture above is true.

But now I am interested in a combinatorial interpretation of it. For the right hand side $\binom{n}{3}$ is the number of ways to choose 3 from a total of $n$, and for the left hand side, it looks like dividing $n$ into 2 groups, one of size $k$, and other of size $(n-k)$, then sum over all possible $k$, but I do not see any clues that how I can choose 3 from these 2 groups.","['summation', 'combinatorial-proofs', 'combinatorics']"

Is there a way to solve this kind of problem passing through Fourier series? My Idea would be to try to rephrase this as a differential equation of the Fourier coefficients and solve for an equilibrium (i.e. a periodic solution). Is this possible? The problem which gave me the idea is the following: There is an electron (point particle, mass $m$, charge $e$) in a space filled by a planar EM-wave, so $\vec{E} = (E\sin(kx-\omega t),0,0)$ and $\vec{B} = (0,B\sin(kx-\omega t),0)$ where $cB=E$. The electron is excited by the wave and emits EM-radiation. Find the emitted radiation. Now, the Lorenz force gives us the equation $m\ddot{x} = e(\vec{E}+\dot{x}\wedge\vec{B})$ to solve.

342146,Definitions in a Theorem of Lang,"I'm trying to understand the following theorem due to Serge Lang (Algebraic Groups over Finite Fields, 1956, Theorem 2): Let $p$ be a prime, and let $k$ be a finite field of $q=p^n$ elements.  Let $G$ be an algebraic group defined over $k$, and suppose $H/k$ is a homogeneous space over $G$.  Then $H$ has a rational point. I've searched the paper to try to see what exactly Lang means by all of these terms, but I can't seem to find any answers.  I just have a few simple questions about some definitions. By algebraic group defined over $k$, does Lang mean a group that is also a variety over $k$ where multiplication and inverse are morphisms of varieties?  If so, then $G$ must be finite because $k$ is finite.  Perhaps he means a variety over $\bar{k}$? By a homogeneous space $H/k$ over $G$, does Lang mean a variety $H$ over $k$ (or $\bar{k}$?) on which $G$ acts transitively and continuously? By rational point, does Lang mean some $h\in H$ such that the coordinates of $h$ in some embedding of $H$ into affine space over $\bar{k}$ all lie in $k$?  I guess here I'm assuming $H$ is an affine variety over $\bar{k}$. Perhaps some of these questions don't make any sense, but the more I try to make them make sense, the more I realized I am just confused and need some straightening out.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-groups', 'group-theory']"

342211,Difference between tangent space and tangent plane,"I’ve avoided doing any manifold (regretting it somewhat) courses, however do have some understanding. Let $p$ be a point on a surface $S:U\to \Bbb{R}^3$, we define: The tangent space to $S$ at $p$, $T_p(S)=\{k\in\Bbb{R}^3\mid\exists\textrm{ a curve }\gamma:(-ε,ε)\to S\textrm{ with }\gamma(0)=p,\gamma'(0)=k\}$. The tangent plane to $S$ at $p$ as the plane $p+T_p(S)\subseteq\Bbb{R}^3$. My current understanding is, in the diagram below the tangent plane is the plane shown, whilst the tangent space would be p minus each element of the plane, hence the corresponding plane passing through the origin.

342226,For what $c > 0$ is $S = \lfloor \left( n+1 \right)^c \rfloor - \lfloor n^c \rfloor$ non-decreasing?,"I recently solved a practical sequence problem, but got curious and tried to generalize it. Let $$ S_{n, c} = \lfloor \left( n+1 \right)^c \rfloor - \lfloor n^c \rfloor $$ be a set of sequences where $ n \in \mathbb{N}, c \in \mathbb{R}^+ $, that is the positive reals. I'm not sure if my notation is clear, but as an example, $ S_{5, 1.1} $ represents the 5th term in the sequence where $ c = 1.1 $. Since $ S_{5, 1.1} = 2 $ and $ S_{6, 1.1} = 1 $, this is an example of a decreasing sequence. For what values of $c$, then, is the sequence non-decreasing? Using the binomial theorem, I was able to prove that it's non-decreasing when $ c $ is an integer, but I've so far not been able to extend that. Any help is greatly appreciated! Edit: My original question asked just for the following two specific cases, which are still the most interesting cases for me, and would still be helpful if a general solution cannot be obtained: What is the smallest $ x \in \mathbb{R}^+ $ such that for all sequences $ S_{n, c} $ where $c \ge x, S_{n, c} $ is non-decreasing (if it exists)?

Then the group axioms can be stated as follows. $(xy)z=x(yz).$ $xe=ex=x.$ $xx^{-1}=x^{-1}x=e.$ Supposing we dropped axiom 2 and forgot about $e$, we would need to rephrase 3. One possibility would be 3'. $xx^{-1}y=x^{-1}xy=yxx^{-1}=yx^{-1}x=y.$ So my first question is, can 3' be shortened and simplified? Now suppose we dropped associativity, as well. Then 3' needs to be further rephrased. One possibility would be 3''. $(xx^{-1})y=(x^{-1}x)y=y(xx^{-1})=y(x^{-1}x)=y,$ and $x(x^{-1}y)=x^{-1}(xy)=(yx)x^{-1}=(yx^{-1})x=y.$ Again, my question is, can 3'' be shortened and simplified?","['semigroups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'magma']"

342254,Notatebility of Uncountable Sets,"I have noticed a pattern. The set of integers is infinite. Therefore one at first would think it impossible to come up with a notation allowing the representation of all integers. This though becomes easy actually to get around. Simply allow larger integers to take up larger notation. Now look at the rational numbers. They are dense, so there are an infinite number of rational numbers between 0 and 1. Seemingly impossible, but not. By dividing two integers, you can come up with any rational numbers. Algebraic, and even all the computable numbers can be notated. Yet when you get to the real numbers, the great uncountable set, there is no finite notation to represent all the real numbers. Why is it that countable sets can be notated, but it seems that uncountable sets can not? Has this been studied before?",['elementary-set-theory']
342267,Non-degenerate bilinear forms and invertible matrices,"I have the following question: Show that a symmetric bilinear form is nondegenerate if and only if its matrix in a basis is invertible Ok so both directions ""if non-degenerate then the matrix is invertible"" and ""if matrix is invertible then the form is nondegenerate"" have to be proven for this. For the first direction. If the bilinear form is non-degenerate its null space is $\left\{0\right\}$, so for every $v \neq 0$ there exists a $v'$ such that $\langle v, v' \rangle \neq 0$ and so there are no zero eigenvalues, I'm pretty sure this somehow implies the determinant of the matrix is also non-zero, as it is the product of the eigenvalues and hence invertible (but not sure how to show this). For the other direction, if the matrix is invertible, then the determinant is non-zero and, if my previous assumption is correct, this implies there are no zero eigenvectors, which implies the null space is $\left\{0\right\}$ and hence non-degenerate?

EDIT: As discussed in the comments, of course there are different ways proving this result, but I would like to be most interested in the continuation of my approach. If you know different solution approaches it is also interesting to know them and discuss them.","['general-topology', 'sequences-and-series']"

342747,"The density --- or otherwise --- of $\{\{2^N\,\alpha\}:N\in\mathbb{N}\}$ for ALL irrational $\alpha$.","Problem Is there an irrational $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that the set $S= \{\,\{2^N\alpha\} :N\,\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is not dense in $[0,1]$. Here $\{x\}=x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ is the fractional part of $x$. Questions very similar to this have been asked in the past. For example Multiples of an irrational number forming a dense subset However right now I can't adjust them and put the two sticks together. Context I was trying to prove the following proposition --- which isn't actually true when $n>2$. Let $n>2$ and let $O_n$ be the (proper) subset of $[0,1]$ of irrational numbers containing only $0$s and $1$s in their base-$n$ expansion. If we take $\alpha\in O_n$ we then have that $$\{n^N\alpha\}\in O_n\text{ for all }N\in\mathbb{N}$$ and so $S$ can not be dense in $[0,1]$ when $n>2$. Proposition Suppose that $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ is a power mapping
$f(z)=z^n$ for some $n\geq 2$. Then the dynamical system $(\mathbb{C},f)$ exhibits the following four behaviours: If $z_0\in\mathbb{D}:=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}$ then $z_n\rightarrow 0$. If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\bar{\mathbb{D}}:=\{z\in\mathbb{Z}:|z|>1\}$ then $z_n\rightarrow\infty$. If $z_0\in\mathbb{T}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|=1\}$ then there are two behaviours: a. If $z_0=e^{q\,2\pi i}$ with $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ then $z_0$ is eventually periodic. b. If $z_0=e^{\alpha\,2\pi i}$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ then $z_0$ has a dense orbit. In fact, $(\mathbb{T},f)$ is a chaotic mapping. Proof: 1, 2 and the first part of 3 were illustrated in class for $n=4$. Here we prove for a general $n\geq 2$. Assume that $z_0=e^{\alpha\cdot\,2\pi i}$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\backslash \mathbb{Q}$ Claim 1: $z_0$ is not eventually periodic. Proof by Contradiction :  Suppose that $z_0=e^{\alpha\cdot2\pi i}$ is eventually periodic. That is there exists an iterate of $z_0$, say $f^N(z_0)$, that is periodic. Note that $$f^N(z_0)=z_0^{n^N}=\left(e^{\alpha\cdot 2\pi i}\right)^{n^N}=e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i}.$$ Now if this point is periodic then there exists an $M\geq 1$ such that $$f^M(e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i})=e^{n^N\alpha\cdot2\pi i}$$ $$\Rightarrow e^{n^Nn^M\alpha\cdot2\pi i}=e^{n^N \alpha\cdot2\pi i}$$ If these two complex numbers are equal then their argument/angle must differ only by a multiple of $360^\circ$; i.e. $k\cdot 2\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$: $$n^{M}n^N\alpha\cdot 2\pi-n^N\alpha\cdot 2\pi=k\cdot 2\pi$$ $$\Rightarrow n^{N+M}\alpha-n^N\alpha=k$$ $$\displaystyle\alpha=\frac{k}{n^{N+M}-n^N},$$ but this is a contradiction as $\alpha$ is not a fraction. Hence $z_0$ is not eventually periodic $\bullet$ Claim 2: Two iterates of $z_0$ can be found that are arbitrarily close together. Proof : Note that the length of the unit circle is $2\pi$. Suppose that we divide the unit circle into $N$ arcs $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N$ each of equal length $\displaystyle \frac{2\pi}{N}$ (to be careful suppose that they contain their 'right' endpoints but not their 'left'). Now, we know that $z_0$ is not eventually periodic so the first $n$ iterates of $z_0$ are all distinct: $$z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3,\dots,z_N.$$ Note that there are $N$ arcs but $N+1$ iterates so by the Pigeonhole Principle there is an arc $A_i$ containing two iterates of $z_0$ --- say $z_i$ and $z_j$ --- that are on the same arc. Take $N\rightarrow \infty$ so that the arcs becoming arbitrarily small and the points become arbitrarily close together $\bullet$ Claim 3: There is a number $M$ such that $z_0$ and $f^M(z_0)$ are arbitrarily close together. Proof : We know that for any $N$ we can find two iterates of $z_0$ that are at most (radially) apart by $\displaystyle \frac{2\pi }{N}$. Denote these by $z_i=f^i(z_0)$ and $z_j=f^j(z_0)$... what I was hoping to do here actually doesn't work.

342768,Way to Tietze's Transformation Theorem,"During our knot-theory lecture we have talking about the following theorem: Given two finite presentations of the same group, one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of Tietze transformations. This theorem is also given in the book from Gilbert & Porter: Knots and Surfaces . Here they are given a proof with some exercises (I also will write down them here), but I don't come further. Can someone help me to solve the exercises to go further with the proof?! Here the questions: Let $P=(X:R)$ and $Q=(X:R\cup S)$ be presentations of the groups $G$ and $H$ resp. with $f:P\rightarrow Q$ given by $f=id:F(X)\rightarrow F(X)$. Show that f is a presentationmapping. What is the corresponding homomorphism $\theta:G\rightarrow H$? When is $\theta$ an isomorphism? From my point of view this is trivial, true?! the corresponding $\theta$ (it exists) is just an inclusion map and it is an isomorphism if $S$ is a consequence from $R$ ?! Let $Y$ be a set, $y\in Y$  and $X=Y-\{y\}$. Suppose $P=(X:R)$ and $Q=(Y:S)$ presentations and $f:F(X)\rightarrow F(Y)$ the homomorphism induced by the inclusion of $X$ into $Y$, then $f(R)\subseteq S$. Describe the corresponding group homomorphism $\theta$. Now suppose $S=f(R)\cup\{yw^{-1}\}$ ($w$ a word in the image of $f$). Prove that $\theta$ is an isomorphism. Hint: Define $g:F(Y)\rightarrow F(X)$ by $g(x)=x$ if $x\in X\subset Y$, g(y)=w. Prove that $g$ a presentationsmapping from $Q$ to $P$ and the corresponding homomorphism is the inverse of $\theta$. I have no idea how to start with this exercise -.- Let $P=(X:R)$ presentation of a group $G$ and let $\phi:F(X)\rightarrow G$ a epimorphism corresponding to the presentation. Suppose $Z$ a finite set disjoint from $X$. Pick homomorphism $\theta:F(X\cup Z)\rightarrow F(X)$ such tha $\theta(x)=x\ \forall x\in X$. Try to describe a set of normal generators for $Ker(\phi\theta)$. Of course $R\subset Ker(\phi\theta)$ but what other elements do we need? The case $Z=\{y\}$ is a good place to start (look up to the previous exercise) Here I also don't know how to begin, because I don't know what I have to do. I know that is quite a lot information, but can someone help me or/and give solutions?!

My uncle wants to organize a group activity with 12 people and wants to start by pairing each person with each other person so they can meet shortly. Everyone has to see every other person, but only once. His initial question was if there could be an easy rotation system to organize this (like putting everyone in two rows or a circle or something like that), which I couldn't find. But now I'm even struggling just to find a way that it can organized at all, by just writing down one example of each of the 11 'meeting rounds' with the numbers of the persons that have to meet in each round. However I'm sure this is a standard mathematical question that has been discussed often before - can someone give me a solution? A not too complicated rotation system would be great, a way to write down the order in which it can be organized would be nice as well.
