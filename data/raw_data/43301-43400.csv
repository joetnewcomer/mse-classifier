429613,Interpolation using trigonometric polynomials of bounded modulus,"Consider a grid of points $T=\{t_1,\ldots,t_m\}$ with $0\le t_i\le 1$. I would like to derive conditions on $t_1,\ldots,t_m$ (interpolation points) under which for any sequence of complex numbers $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_m\in\mathbb{C}$ with $|c_k|=1$, there exists a function $f(t):[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ of the form
\begin{equation*}
f(t)=\sum_{k=-n}^n a_k e^{2\pi i k t}
\end{equation*} (with n as small as possible) such that 1) $f(t)$ interpolates $c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_m\in\mathbb{C}$ on $T$. That is
\begin{equation*}
f(t_k)=c_k
\end{equation*} 2) $|f(t)|< 1$ for $t\notin T$. I know that the condition on the interpolation nodes $t_1,\ldots,t_m$ should look something like the ones appearing below 1) $min_{k,\ell}|t_k-t_\ell|\ge 1/n$ (with the distance meant to be circular that is |0.9-0.1|=0.2). or 2) more sophisticated conditions like: $D_{m}(t_1,\ldots,t_m)$ needs to be small. The discrepancy of a a finite sequence of real numbers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N\in[0,1]$ is defined as 
\begin{equation*}
D_N(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N)=\underset{0\le\alpha<\beta\le 1}{sup}\bigg|\frac{A([\alpha,\beta);N)}{N}-(\beta-\alpha)\bigg|,
\end{equation*}

429636,Questions about the local ring of a point on a variety.,"Let $Y$ be a variety. Let $\mathcal{O}_{P, Y} = \mathcal{O}_{P}$ be the ring of germs of regular functions on $Y$ near $P$. That is, an element of $\mathcal{O}_P$ is pair $\langle U, f \rangle$ where $U$ is an open subset of $Y$ containing $P$ and $f$ is a regular function on $U$. How to show that (1) $\mathcal{O}_P$ is a local ring (has only one maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}$) and (2) $\mathcal{O}_{P}/\mathfrak{m} \cong k$? These questions comes from page 16 of the book Algebraic Geometry by Hartshorne. Take $\mathfrak{m}=\{ f \in \mathcal{O}_P \mid f(P) = 0 \}$. Then $\mathfrak{m} \subseteq \mathcal{O}_P$. It is clear that $\mathfrak{m}$ is an ideal of $\mathcal{O}_P$. Suppose that $f(P) \neq 0$ and $f \in \mathcal{O}_P$. Then $1/f$ is regular in some neighborhood of $P$ and hence $1/f \in \mathcal{O}_P$. How could we show that $1/f \in \mathfrak{m}$? I think that if $1/f \in \mathfrak{m}$, then $1=f \cdot 1/f \in \mathfrak{m}$ and hence $\mathfrak{m} = \mathcal{O}_P$. Is this true? Thank you very much. Edit: I made a mistake. I should consider the ideal $\mathfrak{n}$ such that $\mathfrak{m} \subsetneq \mathfrak{n} \subseteq \mathcal{O}_P$ and show that $\mathfrak{n} = \mathcal{O}_P$.",['algebraic-geometry']

429695,On changing from '<' to '$\le$' when taking limits (with norm $|\bullet|_p$),"I'm reading GouvÃªa's book on $p-$ adic, and there's one problem that I don't think I really get it. Here's a proposition, and the problem attached to it. It's on page 57, 58 of the book. Proposition 3.2.12 The image of $\mathbb{Q}$ under the inclusion $\mathbb{Q} \rightarrowtail \mathbb{Q}_p$ is a dense subset of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ . Proof Take any element $\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ , a Cauchy presentation $\{x_n \}$ of it, and any $\epsilon > 0$ . We'll prove that there's a constant sequence that belongs to $B(\lambda, \epsilon)$ . We now choose an $\epsilon'$ which is slightly less than $\epsilon$ . Since $\{ x_n \}$ is a Cauchy sequence, then there exists $N>0$ , such that for all $n, m \ge N$ , we'll have: $|x_m - x_n| < \epsilon'$ . We claim that the constant sequence $\{ x_N \}$ will indeed satisfy the requirement. For any $n \ge N$ , we'll have $|x_n - x_N| < \epsilon'$ . Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ yields $\lim |x_n - x_N| \color{red}{\le} \epsilon' < \epsilon$ . Which means that $\{ x_N \} \in B (\lambda , \epsilon)$ . Problem 87. Why does < become $\le$ in the limit? Do we really need the business of decreasing $\epsilon$ slightly to $\epsilon'$ ? Ok, honestly, I think that we don't (but the answer states that we do). While it's true that I can find examples when the sign does change in taking limits, say: $x_n = p^n$ , then of course $|x_n|_p = |p^n|_p = \dfrac{1}{p^n}>0, \forall n$ , but $\lim |x_n|_p = 0$ . I think I can do this because 0 is in fact, a limit point of the set $\{p^z | z\in \mathbb{Z} \}$ . However, I don't think there's any example of a Cauchy sequence, such that $|x_n|_p < \epsilon, \forall n$ , but when we take the limit, it'll end up with $\lim |x_n|_p = \epsilon$ . Are there such sequences? Am I missing something here? Or is the book wrong? Thank you guys very much, And have a good day, :*","['p-adic-number-theory', 'cauchy-sequences', 'limits']"

 \lim_{k\to\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-x}\cos(x)}{a_kx^2 +

I have hardly come across to limits of sequences that involve definite integrals (in my undergraduate education so far), so this problem just seems insurmountable at the first glance. I would appreciate any hints. One of the things that comes to mind is to use limit comparison test. For example, we can evaluate integrals such as $$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x}\cos(x)=\frac{1}{2}$$ But for that we would have to bound the integrand somehow. One tempting thing is to interchange the integral and the limit, which would tell us that integrand is zero in the limit, but I highly doubt this is allowed here.

429939,"Lagrange multiplier method, find maximum of $e^{-x}\cdot (x^2-3)\cdot (y^2-3)$ on a circle","I attempted to design an exercise for my engineer students and couldn't solve it myself. Maybe here are some experts in calculus who have some better tricks than I do: The exercise would be to find the maxima of $e^{-x}(x^2-3)(y^2-3)$ on the circle $x^2+(y-1)^2=4$. Now using the Lagrange multiplier method this amounts to solving the following system of equations: $$\begin{align*}
e^{-x}(y^2-3)(-x^2+2x+3)+\lambda\cdot 2x&=0\\
e^{-x}(x^2-3)(2y)+\lambda\cdot 2(y-1)&=0\\
x^2+(y-1)^2&=4
\end{align*}$$ I did not succeed to find the solutions and also my standard online calculor didn't. Now I thought, this is partly because of the $e^{-x}$-term, so it would be good if one could eliminate it. Noting that $x^2+(y-1)^2-4=0$ iff $e^{-x}\cdot (x^2+(y-1)^2-4)=0$ we can instead use Lagrange multipliers on this condition. This amounts to solving the easier system: $$\begin{align*}
(y^2-3)(-x^2+2x+3)+\lambda(-x^2+2x-(y-1)^2+4)&=0\\
(x^2-3)y+\lambda(y-1)&=0\\
x^2+(y-1)^2-4&=0

If not, do you have any ideas how to tweak it a little bit (preferrable on the circle condition side) so that it becomes easier to solve?","['multivariable-calculus', 'lagrange-multiplier']"

While some were completely analytic, the proof given in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis hinted at an algebraic approach. He defines a sequence of normalized polynomials which he convolutes with the arbitrary continuous function $f(x)$ to obtain polynomial approximations. I am aware that convolution may be thought of as an inner product, hence was curious if there is a proof which uses algebraic language and minimizes the analysis. Of course, I do not expect the analysis to disappear, but perhaps it can be marginalized. For example, while the easiest proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra are entirely analytic, there are mostly algebraic proofs which only use analysis to assert that odd degree polynomials have a real root. I seek such a proof because 1) I think it would be interesting, and 2) My intuition works best with algebra.","['linear-algebra', 'functional-analysis', 'analysis']"

430218,Dogbone contour integral/branch cuts/residue at infinity,"I am trying to compute: $$\int_0^1 \frac{\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x+2} dx$$ by contour integration. I define $f(z) = \sqrt{z-z^2}$ with a branch cut on $[0,1]$ in such a way that $f(-1)=\sqrt{2}i$, then define $g(z)=\frac{f(z)}{z+2}$. Then I integrate $g$ clockwise around a dogbone contour from 0 to 1. The two arcs' contributions go to zero as the radius goes to zero, simply because the integrand is bounded if $z$ is away from $-2$. The choice of branch cut means that the integrand is of opposite sign on the two sides of the branch cut. This combined with the different orientation (the top integral is traversed going to the right, the bottom to the left) means that the top and bottom integrals are the same, both equal in the limit to the value that is desired. Consequently: $$2 \int_0^1 \frac{\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x+2} dx = 2 \pi i ( Res(g,-2) + Res(g,\infty) )$$ by the exterior domain residue theorem. The first one is by the rules of residue calculus $f(-2)=\sqrt{6}i$, from how $f$ is defined. This is fine (it turns out the way it should). My problem is with $Res(g,\infty)$. The definition of this is $Res \left (-\frac{g(1/z)}{z^2},0 \right )$. So this is $Res \left (-\frac{f(1/z)}{z^2(1/z+2)},0 \right )$. My only idea for computing this was to try to break up $f(1/z)$ using the branch cut and ultimately binomial expand the square root. Doing this gives the correct answer, namely $-5/2i$, provided that $(-1)^{1/2}=i$ in the binomial expansion formula. I assume this comes from the fact that the binomial expansion holds for the principal square root, but am not sure. Overall plugging these back in gives $$\int_0^1 \frac{\sqrt{x-x^2}}{x+2} dx = \pi (5/2 - \sqrt{6})$$ which is correct.

Define $\overline{R}:= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i$ and $\overline{i}:= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}i$ and by that $$r:=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R_i-\overline{R})(i-\overline{i})}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(R_{i}-\overline{R}\right)^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(i-\overline{i}\right)^{2}}}}.$$ Find a constant $c_n$ and functions $f_i$ such that $$r=1-c_n\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_i(R_i).$$ Give an interpretation for the extrema of r. Compute $\mathbb{E}[r]$ and $Var(r)$. Now suppose there's another observartion $Y_1, ..., Y_m$ and $R_i$, $i=1, ..., n$ now denotes the rank of $X_i$ in the order statistics of $(X_1, ..., X_n, Y_1, ..., Y_m)$. Compute $\mathbb{E}[\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i]$ and $Var(\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i)$. Give an interpretation for the extrema of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_i$. As far as I remember, we didn't treat rank statistics so far. I recall a little something about order statistics and this is supposed to be a repetition. But my trouble starts with 1. and I basically can't make any sense of the whole concept, e.g. the definition of $r$. Can anyone explain some of this stuff to me so I might be able to tackle the problems? [edit]
Sorry, there was another fault in the formula for $r$. [edit2]

430452,Check solutions of vector Differential Equations,"I have solved the vector ODE: $x\prime = \begin{pmatrix}1& 1 \\ -1 &1 \end{pmatrix}x$ I found an eigenvalue $\lambda=1+i$ and deduced the corresponding eigenvector: \begin{align}
(A-\lambda I)x =& 0 \\
\begin{pmatrix}1-1-i & 1 \\-1& 1-1-i \end{pmatrix}x =& 0 \\
\begin{pmatrix} -i&1\\-1&-i\end{pmatrix}x =&0
\end{align}
Which is similar to:
$\begin{pmatrix}i&-1\\0&0 \end{pmatrix}x = 0$ By Row Reduction.
Take $x_2=1$ as $x_2$ is free. We then have the following equation:
\begin{align}
&ix_1 - x_2 = 0 \\
\iff& ix_1 = 1 \\
\iff& x_1 = \frac{1}{i}
\end{align} Thus the corresponding eigenvector for $\lambda=1+i$ is: $\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{1}{i} \\ 1\end{pmatrix}$. My solution should then be: 
\begin{align}
x(t) =& e^{(1+i)t}\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{1}{i} \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\
     =& e^t e^{it}\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{1}{i} \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\
=& e^t\left(\cos(t) + i\sin(t)\right)\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{1}{i} \\ 1\end{pmatrix} \\

430454,Why should $|2^\mathbb{N}|>|\mathbb{N}^2|$ be true?,"I've been thinking a bit about infinite things lately, and this question I had wondered about came back to me. One of the classic expository demonstrations of Cantor's work is the two equally surprising facts that there are as many rationals as natural numbers, but there are more reals than natural numbers. This can be reduced to a statement in cardinal arithmetic, namely that
$$|2^\mathbb{N}|>|\mathbb{N}^2|$$ Now, we can think of these sets as two collections of functions, $2^\mathbb{N}=\{f:\mathbb{N}\to \{0,1\}\}$ and $\mathbb{N}^2=\{f:\{0,1\}\to\mathbb{N}\}$.

how close are the sets: {8,4,5} and {9,8,2}? Could it be a percentage? If there is no way to do this, would you need two sets? How close is {8,4,5} to {9,8,2} compared to the closeness of {2,8,5} to {9,8,2}? PS this is for a computer science project, yet a mathematical question. Edit:
I plan to have something like this: {a:1,b:5,c:6} and compare it to {a:2,b:18,c:24}. In this example, one might say they are fairly close due to the 'a' value being similar, however, {a:5, b:16, c:20} could be considered closer overall. This is being used in a genre recognition program. We want to compare the features of songs (represented as values) by figuring out the values for an ""average"" song of a certain genre, and later compare other songs to the averages and see which one is closest (and hopefully be able to give a percentage of similarity).","['clustering', 'metric-spaces', 'elementary-set-theory']"

Recall this induces a map $f_x:\mathcal O_{Y,f(x)}\rightarrow \mathcal O_{X,x}$ on the level of sheaves. Consider the projection $g:X\times_Y \operatorname{Spec}\mathcal O_{Y,y}\rightarrow\operatorname{Spec} \mathcal O_{Y,y}$. Let $x'$ be the inverse of $x$ under $X\times_Y \operatorname{Spec}\mathcal O_{Y,y}\rightarrow X$. Why do we have $f_x=g_{x'}$? This is stated without justification in Liu's book, but I'm having trouble seeing why it is true. I think we can reduce to the case where $X$ and $Y$ are affine. The associated ring map seems to be, if $Y=\operatorname{Spec} A$ and $X=\operatorname{Spec} B$, $$ A_{\mathfrak p} \rightarrow A_{\mathfrak p} \otimes_A B \cong (A\backslash \mathfrak p)^{-1}B,$$ where we consider $B$ as an $A$-module via the map $\phi: A\rightarrow B$ associated to the map of global sections induced by $f$. I know that the stalk map $X\rightarrow Y$ corresponds to $$A_{\mathfrak p} \rightarrow B_{\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak p)}.$$ So the question now seem to reduce to verifying that $B\backslash \phi^{-1} (\mathfrak p)$ is $\phi^{-1}(A\backslash \mathfrak p)$. And they equal. But the first map I gave is a map of rings, while the second is a map of stalks. So why do they seem to be the same?

430602,Factor $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$,"This is an exercise from Schaum's Outline of Precalculus . It doesn't give a worked solution, just the answer. The question is: Factor $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ The answer is: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2)$ My question is: How did the textbook get this? I tried the following methods (examples of my working below): U-Substitution. Guess and Check. Reversing the question (multiplying the answer out). Here is my working for each case so far. (1) U-Substitution. I tried a simpler case via u-substitution. Let $u = x^2$ and $v = y^2$. Then $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4 = u^2 -11uv + v^2$. Given the middle term is not even, then it doesn't factor into something resembling $(u + v)^2$ or $(u - v)^2$. Also, there doesn't appear to be any factors such that $ab = 1$ (the coefficient of the third term) and $a + b = -11$ (the coefficient of the second term) where $u^2 -11uv + v^2$ resembles $(u \pm a)(v \pm b)$ and the final answer. (2) Guess and Check. To obtain the first term in $x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$ it must be $x^2x^2 = x^4$. To obtain the third term would be $y^2y^2 = y^4$. So I'm left with something resembling: $(x^2 \pm y^2)(x^2 \pm y^2)$. But I'm at a loss as to how to get the final solution's middle term from guessing and checking. (3) Reversing the question Here I took the answer, multiplied it out, to see if the reverse of the factoring process would illuminate how the answer was generated. The original answer: $(x^2 - 3xy -y^2)(x^2 + 3xy - y^2) = [(x^2 - 3xy) - y^2][(x^2 + 3xy) - y^2]$ $= (x^2 - 3xy)(x^2 + 3xy) + (x^2 - 3xy)(-y^2) + (x^2 + 3xy)(-y^2) + (-y^2)(-y^2)$ $= [(x^2)^2 - (3xy)^2] + [(-y^2)x^2 + 3y^3x] + [(-y^2)x^2 - 3y^3x] + [y^4]$ $= x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - y^2x^2 + 3y^3x - y^2x^2 - 3y^3x + y^4$ The $3y^3x$ terms cancel out, and we are left with: $x^4 - 9x^2y^2 - 2x^2y^2 + y^4 = x^4 - 11x^2y^2 + y^4$, which is the original question. The thing I don't understand about this reverse process is where the $3y^3x$ terms came from. Obviously $3y^3x - 3y^3x = 0$ by additive inverse, and $a + 0 = a$, but I'm wondering how you would know to add $3y^3x - 3y^3x$ to the original expression, and then make the further leap to factoring out like terms (by splitting the $11x^2y^2$ to $-9x^2y^2$, $-y^2x^2$, and $-y^2x^2$).","['factoring', 'algebra-precalculus']"

This problem is relevant in the context of for example shape restricted regression, see the article Meyer & Woodroofe (2000), where $\Omega$ is taken to be convex. In the case where $\Omega$ is convex, it is known that $g$ is well-defined, it is then ordinarily known as the ""projection onto a convex set"", also, $g$ is in this case a contraction and is in particular Lebesgue almost everywhere differentiable by Rademacher's theorem. As regards the nonconvex case, it is easy to see that $g$ in general will not be everywhere well-defined, nor even everywhere continuous. If, for example, $\Omega$ is $\mathbb{R}^n$ minus a cone, moving $y$ along the axis of a cone, small perturbations of $y$ will make the projection onto $\Omega$ move wildly, and so $g$ will not have any chance of even being continuous on this axis.","['optimization', 'geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'manifolds', 'real-analysis']"
430694,Unexpected Probability Theory Uses,"I am a french student in mathematical engineering. I had to go trough an intensive 3 year ""preparation"" to pass a ""concours"" to go to High School. In mathematics, I have been taught a lot of algebra, analysis and geometry. The most interesting results I have encoutered were the results which involve two or three of the fields mentionned above. I remember some exercises wich seemed to be difficult multivariate analysis problems but were in fact simple algebra ones. One of my favorites is: Find $$ \inf_{a,b \in \Re}\left(\int_{0}^{1}t^2(\ln(t)-a-bt)dt\right)$$ Such link is very interesting because it gives new ways to solve problems by building links between theories, but it also helps to understand both theories involved. This is with this sort of results that I find mathematics very beautiful, simple and complex at the same time. I've ""recently"" been introduced to probability theory, being taught the basics and more.
But I've failed to encouter such interesting results. Maybe I got used to see beautiful results or I don't grasp them entirely. I saw the link between analysis and probability through pdf, stochastic calculus, between algebra and probability trough conditional expectation... but I wasn't struck. Probability seems to be a tool, a sophisticated tool but a tool. More recently I've seen some results, for example: A simple way to obtain $\prod_{p\in\mathbb{P}}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}$ which makes me think I've missed something. Both in understanding all the aspects of probability theory and in building links between probability theory and other fields. Could you bring me some other striking examples of the power of probability theory?
My criteria is either a use wich simplifies a complex problem from another field or a result which puts light on an uncommon aspect of probability theory.","['probability-theory', 'number-theory', 'analysis']"
430727,What does expected value of sum of two discrete random variables mean?,"I am confused with summing two random variables. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are two random variables denoting how much is gained from each two games. If two games are played together, we can gain $E[X] + E[Y]$ in total. I understand until here. However, in many textbooks, the equation $E[X+Y]=E[X]+E[Y]$ is given as an explanation to expectation of playing two games together. Explanation is more difficult than the result. What does $X+Y$ and $E[X+Y]$ mean? We define $E[X]=\sum X_ip_i$. So, do we define $E[X+Y]=\sum (X_i+Y_i)p_i$ where $p_i$ is the same for both random variables. What if $X$ denotes the equally likely outcomes $1, 2, 3$ and $Y$ denotes the equally likely outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$?","['statistics', 'probability']"

430754,I need help understanding the proof of the Lifting Theorem for $H^1$-functions.,"The Lifiting Theorem by BÃ©thuel [1,Lem.4.2] states Theorem Assume $\mathbb{T}^3 \simeq \Omega=[-\pi n, \pi n]$ is the 3-dimensional torus obtained by identifying opposing edges. Assume further $v \in H^1(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{C}) \simeq H^1_{per}(\Omega, \mathbb{C})$ with \begin{equation} \vert v(x) \vert \geq \frac{1}{2} ~~~~~ \forall x \in \mathbb{T}^3. \end{equation} Then one can rewrite $v=\vert v \vert \exp(i \varphi)$ with $\varphi \in H^1(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R})$. Proof As $\vert v \vert \geq \frac{1}{2}$ we can write $v= \vert v \vert w$ with $\vert w \vert=1$. Question 1 Why is $\vert v \vert \geq \frac{1}{2}$ necessary in order to obtain $v= \vert v \vert w$? Can't I just do that for every function that maps to $\mathbb{C}$? Then we calculate $d(w \times dw) =0 $ and therefore the Hodge-de-Rham decomposition is written as \begin{equation} w \times dw = d \varphi + \sum_{j=1}^3 \alpha_j d x_j \end{equation} where $\alpha_j \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\varphi \in H^1(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{C})$. Question 2 How does he calculate $d(w \times dw)$? Why is that even possible? We have no regularity of $w$ so far and I thought the differential form \begin{equation}  dw(x) = \sum_{i=1}^3 w_{x_i}(x) dx_i(x) \in (\mathbb{R}^n)^\ast\end{equation} is not defined for non-smooth functions $w$. Everything else then follows from properties of the Hodge-de-Rham decomposition. [1] BÃ©thuel, F., P. Gravejat und J. C. Saut: Travelling waves for the Gross-

430766,"Hartshorne Proposition III.9.8, understanding associated points and extensions","From Hartshorne III Prop 9.8 Let Y be a regular scheme of dimension 1, let P $\in Y$ be a closed point, and let X $\subset \mathbf P_{Y-P}^n$ be a closed subscheme which is flat over Y - P. Then there exists a unique closed subscheme $\bar X \subset \mathbf P_Y^n$, flat over Y, whose restriction to $\mathbf P_{Y-P}^n$ is X. The proof consists of taking $\bar X$ to be the set-theoretic closure of X. My trouble is in understanding why the associated points of $\bar X$ are the same as the associated points of X, and why any other extension would have some associated points mapping to P. How can other extensions look like? By the way, how should I actually think about associated points? The only visual example that I have in mind is the ""cross"". Let A := k[x,y]/(xy), then the points (x), (y) and (x,y), only the last of which is closed, are all associated points because every element in the corresponding prime ideals is a zero-divisor. Does this mean that I should think of associated points as points that have some intersection with ""another irreducible component""?","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

430797,Can $x^{x^{x^x}}$ be a rational number?,"If $x$ is a positive rational number, but not an integer, then can $x^{x^{x^x}}$ be a rational number ? We can prove that if $x$ is a positive rational number but not an integer, then $x^x$ can not be rational: Denote $x=\dfrac{b}{a},(a,b)=1,x^x=\dfrac{d}{c},(c,d)=1,$
$$\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)^\dfrac{b}{a}=\dfrac{d}{c} \hspace{12pt}\Rightarrow  \hspace{12pt}\left(\dfrac{b}{a}\right)^b=\left(\dfrac{d}{c}\right)^a \hspace{12pt}\Rightarrow  \hspace{12pt}b^b c^a=d^a a^b$$
Since $(a,b)=1,(c,d)=1,$ we have $c^a\mid a^b$ and $a^b\mid c^a$, hence $a^b=c^a.$
Since $(a,b)=1$, $a^b$ must be an $ab$-th power of an integer, assume that $a^b=t^{ab},$ then $a=t^a,$ where $t$ is a positive integer, this is impossible if $t>1,$ so we get $t=1,a=1$, hence $x$ is an integer. Then from GelfondâSchneider theorem , we can prove that if $x$ is a positive rational number but not an integer, then $x^{x^x}$ can not be rational. In fact, it can not be an algebraic number, because both $x$ and $x^x$ are algebraic numbers and $x^x$ is not a rational number. Can we prove that $x^{x^{x^x}}$ is irrational? Can $x^{x^{\dots (n-th)^{\dots x}}}~(n>1)$ be rational?","['tetration', 'number-theory', 'rationality-testing', 'transcendental-numbers', 'power-towers']"
