1429419,Does $\lim_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x}$ exist or not?,"Does this right-handed limit exist or not? $$\lim_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x}$$ Schaum's Easy Outline of Calculus (Second Edition) says it does. And doesn't. An example in the book states: The function $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$; then $f$ is defined only to the right of zero. Okay. So the right-handed limit does exist. Hence, $\lim_{x\to 0} \sqrt{x}=\lim_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x}=0$. Okay. I'm still with you. The limit is $0$. Of course, $\lim_{x\to 0^+} \sqrt{x}$ does not exist,... Qué, Mr. Fawlty? ... since $\sqrt{x}$ is not defined when $x<0$. Okay, so are they messing with me? Is my coffee too weak? Too strong? Is there some subtle truth about limits that escapes me? Or is that a typo? Did they mean in that last line to omit the '$+$' by the '$0$' and write ""Of course, $\lim_{x\to 0} \sqrt{x}$ does not exist,...""?

1429493,"Problem in understanding the solution of exact differential $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = du(x,y)$.","If $M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = du(x,y)$, then it is an exact differential equation. For that to happen, $$\left(\dfrac{\partial M(x,y)}{\partial y}\right)_x =\left(\dfrac{\partial N(x,y)}{\partial x}\right)_y \tag1.$$ I was following Differential Equations by  Balachandra Rao, S. Staff to see how to find $u(x,y)$. For most of the part but one, I could conceive. The proof goes using  the first part of $(1)$ after integrating it to get $$u(x,y) = \int M(x,y) dx + \phi (y).$$ In order to satisfy the second condition of $(1)$, there exists a certain $\phi (y)$. So, $$\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx\right]+ \phi'(y)$$ which must be equal to $$N(x,y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx\right]+ \phi'(y) \implies \phi'(y) = N(x,y) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx\right] .$$ LHS is independent of $x$; so RHS must also be independent of $x$; in order to verify this, we take the partial derivative of RHS w.r.t. $x$ : $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[N(x,y) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx\right]\right] = \dfrac{\partial N(x,y)}{\partial x} -\dfrac{\partial M(x,y)}{\partial y}= 0.$$ So, RHS is independent of $x$. Then by integrating, we get $$\phi(y) = \int\left[N(x,y) -\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right] \right]dy + C .$$ Putting the value of $\phi(y)$, we get $$u(x,y) = \int M(x,y) dx + \int\left[N(x,y) -\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right] \right]dy.$$ This is the value of $u(x,y)$ . But the book presents the working rule as A "" working rule "" convenient to apply for solving an exact differential equation is as follows: $$\underset{[y\; \text{const.}]}{\int M dx} + [\color{red}{\text{Terms of} \; N\; \text{not containing} \; x}] dy = c$$ See the red marked statement; $M(x,y)$ is not there, but in the derivation the parenthesis contained $\dfrac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right] $. As if it was excluded in the working rule without specifying any reason. If I break $$\int\left[N(x,y) -\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right] \right]dy$$ into $$\int N(x,y) dy - \int \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right] dy$$, then I get $$\int N(x,y) dy - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right].$$ The second term $$-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[\int M(x,y) dx \right]$$ is absent in the red-marked statement.

1429667,"Is this a correct bijection between $(0,1]$ and $[0,1]$?","I need to give an explicit bijection between $(0, 1]$ and $[0,1]$ and I'm wondering if my bijection/proof is correct. Using the hint that was given, I constructed the following function $f: (0, 1] \to [0,1]$:
$$
x \mapsto \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - x & \text{if } x \in (1-2^{-i}, 1-2^{-i-1}]\text{ for an } i \in \mathbb{N}_0 \\
1 & \text{if } x = 1 \end{array}\right.
$$ It's easy to see that for every $x \in (0, 1)$, there exists such an $i$. Now define $\tilde{f}: [0,1] \mapsto (0,1]$ with 
$$
x \mapsto \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - x & \text{if } x \in [1-2^{-i}, 1-2^{-i-1})\text{ for an } i \in \mathbb{N}_0 \\
1 & \text{if } x = 1 \end{array}\right.
$$ I want to prove that $\tilde{f}(f(x)) = f(\tilde{f}(x)) =  x$, so it has an inverse and therefore is a bijection. The case $x=1$ is trivial, so assume that $x \in (0,1)$ with $x \in (1-2^{-i}, 1-2^{-i-1}]$ for some $i \in \mathbb{N}_0$. This interval has length $1-2^{-i-1} - (1-2^{-i}) = 2^{-i-1}$, so we can write $x = 1-2^{-i} + \epsilon\cdot 2^{-i-1}$ for some $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$. We now calculate $f(x)$:
\begin{align*}
f(x)
&= 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - x\\
&= 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - (1-2^{-i} + \epsilon\cdot 2^{-i-1})\\
&= 1 - 2^{-i-1}(1+\epsilon).
\end{align*}
We conclude that $f(x) \in [1-2^{-i}, 1-2^{-i-1})$. We now use the definition of $\tilde{f}$, so if we calculate $\tilde{f}(f(x))$, we get
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}(f(x)) 
&= 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - f(x) \\
&= 2 - 2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - (2-2^{-i} - 2^{-i-1} - x) \\
&= x.
\end{align*} We conclude that $f$ has an inverse. Using exactly the same reasoning, we get that $f(\tilde{f}(x)) = x$ for all $x \in [0,1]$. Therefore it's inverse exists and it has to be a bijection. I know there are less cumbersome methods of proving this fact, but as of now this is the only thing I can come up with.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

1429717,Understanding the Inertia Group in Ramification Theory,"I am a beginner student of Algebraic Number Theory and I am starting to learn ramification theory (of global fields). My question asks for motivation for a definition I was given. Let $K$ be an algebraic number field, $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ its ring of integers, $L/K$ a Galois extension and $\mathcal{O}_{L}$ the integral closure of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ in $L$. I know that the group $G=Gal(L/K)$ acts transitively on the set of prime ideals $\mathfrak{P}_{i}$ of $\mathcal{O}_{L}$ above a prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and it's just a natural thing to consider the decomposition group (of one of these ideals) $G^{Z}(\mathfrak{P})=\{\sigma\in G\:|\:\sigma(\mathfrak{P})=\mathfrak{P}\}$, which is the stabilizer of $\mathfrak{P}$ under this action. Now, in the paper I am following, together with the decomposition group, it was defined the group 
\begin{equation}
G^{T}(\mathfrak{P})=\{\sigma\in G\:|\:\sigma(\alpha)\equiv\alpha\mod \mathfrak{P}\:\:\forall\alpha\in\mathcal{O}_{L}\},
\end{equation} and this one I want to understand better. I was told that each element of $G^{Z}(\mathfrak{P})$ induces an automorphism in the quotient $\mathcal{O}_{L}/\mathfrak{P}$, which is pretty reasonable. This $G^{T}(\mathfrak{P})$ looks like the subgroup of elements of $G^{Z}(\mathfrak{P})$ that induce the identity in the quotient $\mathcal{O}_{L}/\mathfrak{P}$. From my spying on other books and papers, i recognize this group as the so called $\textbf{Inertia group}$. My question is basically: What does the Inertia group tells us? When we look at the index $(G:G^{Z}(\mathfrak{P}))$, it gives us a notion of ""how many primes did $\mathfrak{p}$ split into in $\mathcal{O}_{L}$"". What about the inertia group? What is its meaning? And it is something as natural as considering the stabilizer of a group action?","['ramification', 'number-theory', 'ideals', 'algebraic-number-theory']"

it is said $(\omega+2)\omega=\omega^2 +2$. On the other hand, in this

1429782,An integral from Newton's theorem,"One way of proving Newton's theorem on the potential of a spherically symmetric measure (see below) is to evaluate the integral

In what ways can one prove this for general $n \neq 2$? (Integer $n$ is obviously the interesting case.) I'm looking in particular for some more elementary ways of doing it (I've added a couple of rather high-powered ways below), but otherwise, anything goes: complex analysis, Fourier transforms, whatever. (The case $n=2$ is much easier, and has been answered before on this site.) It is clear that for $r>1$, we can take out a factor of $r^{2-n}$, reducing to the $r<1$ case ($r=1$ is easy: just apply double-angle formulae and the definition of the beta function). (The following is the context from which the above arises.) Let $\mu(x)$ be a measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The Coulomb potential of $\mu$, $D(\mu)(x)$, is defined as
$$ D(\mu)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} G_n(x-y) \, d\mu(y), $$
where $G_n$ is the fundamental solution of Laplace's equation in $\mathbb{R}^n$,
$$ G_n(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{(n-2)S_{n-1}} \lvert x \rvert^{2-n} & n \neq 2 \\
\frac{1}{2\pi} \log{\lvert x \rvert} & n=2
\end{cases}, $$
$S_{n-1}$ the surface area of the $(n-1)$-dimensional sphere.
(The point being of course that $-\Delta D(\mu) = \mu $.) Newton's theorem states that for a spherically symmetric measure $\mu$, the Coulomb potential satisfies
$$ D(\mu)(x) = G_n(x) \int_{|y|\leqslant |x|} d\mu(y) + \int_{|y|>|x|} G_n(y) \, d\mu(y) $$
(see, for example, Lieb and Seiringer, The Stability of Matter in Quantum Mechanics , p.91f.) (We assume that all the appropriate integrals converge.) Now, one way of proving this (indeed, probably the simplest way) is to turn the integral into spherical coordinates and do the integrals over spheres. It is easy to see that $\lvert x-y \rvert = \sqrt{\lvert x \rvert^2 + \lvert y \rvert^2 - 2\lvert x \rvert \lvert y \rvert \cos{\theta} }$, $\theta$ the angle between $x$ and $y$. Choosing the right spherical coordinates eventually gives us the integral
$$ S_{n-2}\int_0^{\pi} \frac{\sin^{n-2}{\theta}}{(\lvert x \rvert^2 + \lvert y \rvert^2 - 2\lvert x \rvert \lvert y \rvert \cos{\theta} )^{(n-2)/2}} \, d\theta, $$
for $n \neq 2$, which we need to show is equal to
$$ S_{n-1} \max{(\lvert x\rvert ,\lvert y\rvert )})^{2-n}, $$

1429917,Using Fubini's Theorem in Contour Integrals proof,"I have a few questions regarding the following proof: Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is a unital Banach algebra, and that $g$ is a complex-valued function which is analytic on $\sigma(a)$ while $f$ is a complex-valued function which is analytic on $g(\sigma(a))$. Then $(f \circ g)(a) = f(g(a))$. Proof: Let $V$ be an open neighbourhood of $g(\sigma(a))$ upon which $f$ is analytic and consider $U = g^{-1}(V)$, an open neighbourhood of $\sigma(a)$. Let $\Gamma_{1}$ be a system of closed contours in $U$ such that 
\begin{align}
 &\text{Ind}_{\Gamma_{1}}(\lambda) = 1~~\text{for all } \lambda \in \sigma(a)~~\text{and}~~\text{Ind}_{\Gamma_{1}}(\lambda) \neq 0~~\text{implies that }\lambda \in U.

Let $\Gamma_{2}$ be a system of closed contours in $V$ such that

\text{Ind}_{\Gamma_{2}}(\beta) = 1 \text{ for all }\beta \in g(\sigma(a))~~\text{and }\text{Ind}_{\Gamma_{2}}(\beta)=1~~\text{for all }\beta \in g(\Gamma_{1}).

Theorem 2.15 : If $f: B \cup C \rightarrow A$ is a function, then $f = f_{[B]} \cup f_{[C]}$ The book states that the proof is simple, so I think that I'm missing something fundamental. Right now I think my best bet to prove this is to work with the conditions for a function (listed below). But I'm not too sure how to proceed, as I haven't seen a similar proof to imitate. I'm particularly confused about where exactly I should break up the function $f$ into the union of $f_{[B]}$ and $f_{[C]}$, respectively. Could anyone point out what I may be missing in the proof, or some other guidance? We defined a function as follows:
Let $A$ and $B$ be classes and let $f$ be a graph.
Then $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a function iff $\forall x \in A$, $\exists y \in B$ such that $(x,y) \in f$, and the image of $x$ is unique. domain $f = A$, and range $f \subseteq B$. Attempted Proof/Outline Assume that $f: B \cup C \rightarrow A$ is a function. Now, (1) $x \in$ dom $f$  $\Rightarrow$ $\exists y \ni$ $(x,y) \in f$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ $(x,y) \in (B \cup C) \times A$ (3) $\Rightarrow$ $x \in (B \cup C)$ $\wedge$ $y \in A$ (4) $\Rightarrow$ ($x \in B$ $\vee$ $x \in C$) $\wedge$ $y \in A$ (5) After distributing $\Rightarrow$ ($x \in B \wedge y \in A$) $\vee$ ($x \in C \wedge y \in A$) (6) Returning to Cartesian Product $\Rightarrow$ $(x,y) \in [(B \times A) \cup (C \times A)]$ Right here it looks like I have the function split into a union, which I want, since we defined a function to simply be a graph.

What is the probability that each of the final three rolls is at least as large as the roll preceding it? This question is from the AIME 2001. I am looking for a solution that does not use brute-force methods. Considering a starting point at the number $1$, the problem can be formulated as finding the number of integer tuples $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ such that: $x_1\ge0,x_2\ge0,x_3\ge_0,x_4\ge0$ $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4\le5$ Each element $x_i$ in a tuple represents the increment in throwing the die for the $i-th$ time over what was obtained on the $(i-1)-st$ throw. We consider the $0-th$ throw to be $1$. Hence, there is a one-to-one mapping between all qualifying dice throws and all tuples that meet the stated conditions. I know the total number of possible dice rolls is $6^4$ but am unsure how to count the number of tuples. The brute-force method is to simply count the number of distinct solutions to each of $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=0,\quad x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=1,\ldots$ by listing all ways of making up the sums accounting for permutations. For example: $$\underline{x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=2} \\

(0,0,0,2) & 4 & \text{perms} \\

1430099,"Set of branch points isn't discrete, but branch points are isolated?","I refer to Chapter II.4 of Rick Miranda - Algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces , which I understand says that the branch points of a nonconstant holomorphic map $F: X \to Y$ between Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$ , both of which are not necessarily compact, form a discrete subset of range $Y$ of the map $F$ . (Not sure if 'connected' is part of the definition of Riemann surfaces in other textbooks, but it is here.) Question 1 : Do I understand correctly, and is this indeed true? What else I understand: $A$ is a discrete subspace/subset (I just assume everything here is the usual subspace topology) of $B$ if and only if every singleton subset of $A$ is open in $A$ if and only if every point of $A$ is isolated. This overflow question ( Basic question about branch points on Riemann surfaces ) seems to suggest this is not true but is true if $F$ is proper. However, I'm not sure the definitions of Riemann surface are the same (maybe some answers use definitions where Riemann surfaces are not necessarily connected or something). 2.1. I know $F$ is 'discrete' (meaning that its fibres are discrete; here, i refer to a different text ): see definition before Lemma 3.1, on p. 7), by Proposition II.3.12, and open, by open mapping theorem, which is Proposition II.3.8, but I'm not sure these help show $F$ is proper or are otherwise helpful. Ostensibly 'discrete' maps don't map discrete subsets to discrete subsets. This stackexchange question ( Are branch points always isolated? ) seems to suggest this is true. I think this is true if $F$ is injective or at least something like locally injective. (Please don't make me type up all the stuff I did for this part.) However based on the question in (3) and based on the '3.2. Branch points' on p. 7 in text by Armin Rainer in (2.1) , which I think uses the term 'branch points' to mean the same thing as what Miranda means by 'ramification points' (and thus is different from Miranda's 'branch points'), it seems that no neighbourhood $U$ of a ramification point $p \in U \subseteq X$ of $F$ is such that the restriction $F|_U$ is injective. Kinda related: If $F$ has a ramification point, then is $F$ necessarily not injective? This page ( rigtriv: Hurwitz’s Theorem ) says Now, the ramification and branch points must form a discrete set I don't think the page assumes anything like $F$ is proper. The Armin Rainer text in (2.1) actually seems to assume proper based on the '3.7. Proper holomorphic maps' part, but said part refers to 'Lemma 3.17', so I think proper can be replaced with closed. Maybe $F$ is closed or something. Kinda related (see Question 2 below): When closed and continuous maps discrete to discrete S. K. Donaldson - Riemann Surfaces says If $F$ is proper then the image $\Delta = F(R)$ is discrete in $Y$ . This seems to have all the same assumptions as with Miranda. Ostensibly, either Miranda is wrong or there's some higher level machinery that allows us to omit $F$ proper. Question 2 : To possibly generalise this, what are the minimum requirements on $F, X$ and $Y$ to make $F$ map discrete subsets to discrete subsets? I mean, I'm not sure we really need 'holomorphic' here. I have a feeling this applies perhaps to maps that are just open/closed, continuous and discrete and spaces that are just Hausdorff and locally compact or something.

1430107,Insect eyes. Tiling spheres with hexagons - pentagons required as facet size decreases?,"I’m an amateur naturalist and am fascinated with the underlying geometry of an insect eye primarily made of hexagonal facets. In particular, how the sphere surface is fully packed as the hexagons become small with respect to the sphere radius. When the hexagon is large relative to the sphere radius, such as a soccer ball, it is a truncated icosahedron with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. As the hexagons decrease in size is there a fixed relation between the number of pentagons required and are they still evenly distributed in some pattern? As the hexagons get progressively smaller, is it true to say that the hexagon becomes flatter on the sphere surface and as hexagons can fully pack a plane, does this suggest that at the limit, hexagons alone can fully pack a sphere surface? From my own study of the cornea of a cultivated silk moth eye, the eye diameter is ca. 1.4 mm and the width of each facet across flats is ca. 0.0256 mm (includes wall thickness). But there are a noticeable number of pentagons scattered across the surface, a selection marked with a yellow dot in the image I took below. They seem rather randomly distributed though and wasn’t sure if this was Mother Nature getting a hexagonal facet wrong occasionally or that she can’t bypass geometry and still needs to add some pentagons. If estimating the number of facets on the eye is dividing the hexagonal area (including wall thickness) into the sphere area as good a way as any? In this case gives 7233 for both eyes combined as each silk moth eye is only 2/3rds of a hemisphere. Thanks for any insight!

Thus, $$dF = F_x\,dx + F_y\,dy = U_x\,dx + iV_x\,dx + U_y dy + iV_y\,dy$$ Making use of $$dz = dx + i\,dy,$$ $$dz∗ =dx−i\,dy,$$ We plug in $$dx = \frac 1 2 (dz + dz∗),$$ $$dy= \frac 1 {2i}(dz−dz∗)$$ into the equation of $dF$, thus we get: $$dF = \frac 1 2 (U_x + V_y + i(V_x - U_y))\, dz + \frac 1 2 (U_x - V_y + i(V_x + U_y))\, dz*$$ Now it can be seen that if the function $f(z)$ (and thus $F(x,y)$) satisfies the Cauchy Riemann Equations, then the factor in front of $dz*$ will be zero, and we will have the expression for the derivative of the function $F(x,y)$ (and hence $f(z)$).

Given any fixed $k\in\Bbb N$, we can deduce from the convergence of $y_{n}$ to $x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ that $y_{k}^{n}\rightarrow x_k$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Since $y_{k}^{n}\ge0\  \forall \ k\in\Bbb N$ then $x_k\ge0$. Therefore $x_k\ge0\ \forall \ k\in\Bbb N$. Now, since $y_n\rightarrow x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$ and $\|y_n\|_{1}=1\ \forall \ n\in\Bbb N$, by continuity of the norm we obtain that $1=\|y_n\|_{1}\rightarrow \|x\|_{1}$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$.

But, in order to move the limit inside I need to use the dominated convergence theorem. But I do not know if $|f_n(i)|=|\nu_n(A_i)|$ is dominated by an integrable function? Can you guys please help me?","['lebesgue-measure', 'measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'complex-integration', 'lebesgue-integral']"
1430369,Sum of first n natural numbers proof,"I know how to prove this by induction but the text I'm following shows another way to prove it and I guess this way is used again in the future. I'm confused by it. So the expression for first n numbers is:
$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$ And this second proof starts out like this. It says since: $$(n+1)^2-n^2=2n+1$$ Absolutely no idea where this expression came from, doesn't explain where it came from either. Then it proceeds to say:
\begin{align}
2^2-1^2&=2*1+1 \\
3^2-2^2&=2*2+1\\
&\dots\\
n^2-(n-1)^2&=2(n-1)+1\\

1430439,How to show that the event that a prisoner does not go free is not measurable,"I was reading this webpage a few months ago about the following problem- A countable infinite number of prisoners are placed on the natural numbers, facing in the positive direction (ie, everyone can see an infinite number of prisoners).  Hats will be placed and each prisoner will be asked what his hat color is.  However, to complicate things, prisoners cannot hear previous guesses or whether they were correct.  In this new situation, what is the best strategy? (I won't link the best strategy in case someone wants to give it a go but note that my question is about the solution) and I recall my friend and I were trying to come up with a formal argument for why the probability is ill-defined. We kept going in circles so we left it in the end. Recently though I stumbled upon the page again, and saw Terence Tao's comment; I copy the relevant paragraph, If we have an infinite number of prisoners, with the hats assigned randomly (thus, we are working on the Bernoulli space ${\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N}$ ), and one uses the strategy coming from the axiom of choice, then the event $E_j$ that the $j^{th}$ prisoner does not go free is not measurable, but formally has probability 1/2 in the sense that $E_j$ and its translate $E_j + e_j$ partition ${\Bbb Z}_2^{\Bbb N}$ where $e_j$ is the $j^{th}$ basis element, or in more prosaic language, if the $j^{th}$ prisoner’s hat gets switched, this flips whether the prisoner gets to go free or not. The “paradox” is the fact that while the $E_j$ all seem to have probability 1/2, each element of the event space lies in only finitely many of the $E_j$ . This can be seen to violate Fubini’s theorem – if the $E_j$ are all measurable. Of course, the $E_j$ are not measurable, and so one’s intuition on probability should not be trusted here. It feels like he concludes the non-measurability of $E_j$ from a violation of Fubini, but I don't see it. Can someone flesh this argument out for me? It has been nagging me for a long time now and I would be very grateful :)","['probability-theory', 'paradoxes', 'axiom-of-choice', 'measure-theory']"

The problems is as follows: Prove that $\,f(x)=\arctan(x)+\arctan(1/x)= \pi/2\,$ if $\,x>0\,$ and $\,-\pi/2\,$ if $\,x<0$. What I did was this: first of all we note that, since $-\pi/2<\arctan y<\pi/2$ for all $y$, $-\pi<f(x)<\pi$. Now , consider 
$$
\tan\big(f(x)\big)
= \tan\left(\arctan(x)+\arctan\left(\frac{1}{x} \right)\right)
= \frac{\tan\left(\arctan(x)\right) + \tan\left(\arctan\left(\frac{1}{x} \right)\right)}
{1 - \tan\big(\arctan\left(x\right)\big) \tan\left(\arctan\left(\frac{1}{x} \right)\right)}=\frac{x+(1/x)}{0},

$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{\infty}=0$ $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1-0}{\infty}=0$$ $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{\infty}-\frac{0}{\infty}=0$$ So, in this case $\frac{0}{\infty}=0$. What could be the answer and its explanation ?",['limits']
1430938,Why are inner products defined to be linear in the first argument only?,"It seems to me that if the base field is the real numbers, then we have linearity in both arguments i.e. $\langle u + v, w + z\rangle = \langle u,w\rangle + \langle u,z\rangle + \langle v,w\rangle + \langle v,z\rangle$ because we know $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$ for any $y,x$ Do we only define inner products to be linear in their first argument in case the base field is the complex numbers?

Suppose T is a normal operator on a Hilbert space H. Show that there exists a self-adjoint operator S on H such that T=f(S), where f is continuous function from spectrum of S into S. My approach to the problem was to find out an operator S and show that the $C^*$ algebra generated by $I$ and $S$ includes T. Then, continuous functional calculus would prove the result. So my first guess was to choose $S=(T+T^*)/2$. However, I have been unable to show that T is the limit of some polynomial in S. Is my intuition about the problem correct? In that case, please provide some suggestions regarding how to show that T is in the unital sub-algebra generated by S?","['operator-algebras', 'operator-theory', 'functional-analysis']"

1431157,Why is the cancellation of partial derivatives like fractions justified in this example?,"Suppose we have two functions $Q=Q(q,p)$ and $p=p(q,Q)$ (the context is not important here, but if you're wondering $(p,q)$ arise as coordinates in a Hamiltonian system, and $(P,Q)$ are alternative coordinates derived from a canonical transformation). I'm looking at an example and the final step is:
\begin{equation}
\dots=\frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{p}}\Bigg{|}_q\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{Q}}\Bigg{|}_q = 1
\end{equation} Now I have looked at various stackexchange posts and spent quite a while trying understand why you can treat normal derivatives like fractions, and why you can't do the same for partial derivatives, which perhaps seems contradictory to the last step above. I have tried to justify it in the following way, can someone please tell me if this is correct (I've taken out the vertical restriction bars to save time). We have:
\begin{equation}
dQ=\frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{q}}dq + \frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{p}}dp~~~~~,~~~~~dp=\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{q}}dq + \frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{Q}}dQ
\end{equation} Now, since $q$ is held constant, $dq=0$. Hence if we divide through by $dp$ in the left equation and $dQ$ in the right we get $\frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{p}}=\frac{dQ}{dp}$ and $\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{Q}}=\frac{dp}{dQ}$, and using the fact that we can cancel total derivatives like fractions (for reasons I'm not wanting to discuss here, unless they are important to the dicussion), we have: \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial{Q}}{\partial{p}}\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{Q}} = \frac{dQ}{dp}\frac{dp}{dQ}=1
\end{equation} Is this correct, and if so, am I overcomplicating things at all? Is there perhaps a more intuitive reason why in this case , we can cancel the partial derivatives like fractions? Thanks","['partial-derivative', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'derivatives']"

$$u^\mu \nabla_\mu u^\nu = f(s)u^\nu$$ If the RHS is zero, s is affine; if not, s is not affine. Does this make sense? It strikes me that to find an affine parameter all you need is the equations of the curve $x^\mu (s)$ and their derivatives $u^\mu$. Is this true? I was wondering if we need to know the metric tensor $g$ also?
I thought one needs to write the geodesic equation 
$$\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{ds^2}+\Gamma^\mu_{\nu \sigma}\frac{dx^\nu}{ds}\frac{dx^\sigma}{ds}=0$$ and check if its RHS is zero or not.
