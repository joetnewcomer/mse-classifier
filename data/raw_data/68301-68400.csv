820211,How to find the following integration,"Let $X_1, \cdots, X_n$ be $iid$ normal random variables with unknown mean $\mu$ and known variance $\sigma^2$.

Note that $Y:= \bar X$ is also normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$. $$E[\Phi(\bar X)] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \Phi(y) f_Y(y) dy.$$ Let $z=\frac{y-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ and the above integration becomes $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty \Phi(\mu+\frac{\sigma z}{\sqrt{n}}) \phi(z) dz$$ I could not proceed any further from here.

820341,Relations counting in two sets,"I have two sets $A=\{1,2,3, 4\}, \ B=\{5,6,7,8,9\}$. I wanted to count the relations from $A$ to $B$ that didn't include $1$ in their domain. First i did it like this: $2^{20} - 2^5 + 1  = 1048545$ since $2^{20}$ is the number of all relations, $2^5$ is the number of relations from $\{1\}$ to B and plus $1$ cause $2^5$ includes the empty relation which i need. This is a bit weird cause it means $99\%$ of all relations do not include $1$ in their domain which i think is odd. So i tried another method, i said lets look at $A$ like $A=\{2,3,4\}$ and now we have $2^{15} = 32768$ relations which contains all except 1. I liked this solution more but still it looks a bit odd to me, do only $32768$ relations out of $104k+$ relations do not include 1 in their domain? so little?

820425,Pigeonhole principle and finite sequences,"Suppose we have $75$ boxes that are labeled from $1$ to $75$ and that in each box there is at least one ball, but there are not more than $125$ balls total. I'm trying to find the largest number $n \in \left\{1,\, \ldots,\, 75 \right\}$ such that this statement is true: There is a collection of neighbouring boxes that contain exactly $n$ balls together. With neighbouring boxes I mean that their labels have to be consecutive. I hope it's clear what I mean. We can rephrase the statement like this: $1 \leq x_i$, $1 \leq i \leq 75$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{75} x_i \leq 125$. Then there is a sequence $x_i,\, x_{i+1},\, \ldots,\, x_{i+j}$ such that $n=x_i + x_{i+1} + \ldots + x_{i+j}$ for some $j$. The pigeonhole principle allows an easy proof of the statement for $n \leq 24$ that doesn't work for $n \geq 25$. I tried to apply the following algorithm to create simple counter-examples: To prevent the first $n$ boxes from contributing to a collection, we need $n+1$ balls in the $n$th box. Then we do the same with the following boxes, starting at $n+1$ and so on. The algorithm only works for $33 \leq n \leq 49$. For smaller $n$, we would need two boxes with $n+1$ balls, but since we have at most $125$ balls altogether and each box contains at least one ball, there are not enough spare balls. For $50 \leq n \leq 75$, there are not even enough balls to put $n+1$ balls in any box. If the algorithm I mentioned above is optimal, then the statement is true for all $n$, except those between $33$ and $49$. But if that's true, how can I prove it for $25 \leq n \leq 32$ and $50 \leq n \leq 75$?","['pigeonhole-principle', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

820474,Degree 3 algebraic curve with a triple point,"The following problem appeared on an exam I had yesterday. I was unable to solve it, but I would like to know the solution. Let $k$ be algebraically closed, and let $f\in k[X,Y]$ be a polynomial with $\deg f = 3$. Assume that $V(f)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^2$ has a triple point $p$. Show that $V(f)$ is reducible. Eventually after an affine transformation, we can assume that $p=(0,0)$ Then each monomial in $f$ has dimension 3, so $f=aX^3+bX^2Y+cXY^2+dY^3$ is homogeneous, which means that $V(f)$ is a collection of lines through the origin. If we look at the projection onto $P^1$, we get $V(f)\subseteq \mathbb{A}^1=V(aX^3+bX^2+cX+d)$ for the points at finite distance, which is a collection of at most 3 distict points. However, how do we exclude the case where $f(X,1)$ has a triple root, say at $X=x_0$, in which case $V(f)$ is a single ray through the origin and $(x_0,1)$ ?

Notice that $\forall n\in\mathbb{N} : f_n\in C^1[0,1]$ Let $f=\sqrt{x}$ We see that $(f_n)$ converges to $f$ in sup norm in $C[0,1]$, thus it is Cauchy. $C^1[0,1]$ is a subspace of $C[0,1]$ and all terms of $(f_n)$ are in $C^1[0,1]$, so $(f_n)$ is Cauchy in $C^1[0,1]$ But $f$ is not in $C^1[0,1]$.

820592,Let $f$ and $g$ be two group homomorphisms from $G$ to $G'$. Is $H$ a subgroup of $G$?,"Can someone please verify this? Let $f$ and $g$ be two group homomorphisms from $G$ to $G'$. Let $H \subset G$ be the subset $\{x \in G: f(x)=g(x)\}$. Is $H$ a subgroup of $G$? Let $e$ and $e'$ denote the identity elements of $G$ and $G'$, respectively. Using the fact that a homomorphism maps the identity to the identity, we have \begin{eqnarray}
f(e) = g(e) = e'
\end{eqnarray} Therefore, $e \in H$. Now, let $x \in H$. Then, \begin{eqnarray}
f(x) &=& g(x) \\

Since we proved that $e \in H$,
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x \cdot x^{-1}) &=& g(x \cdot x^{-1}) \\
f(x)*f(x^{-1})&=&g(x)*g(x^{-1}) \\
f(x)*f(x^{-1}) &=& f(x)*g(x^{-1}) \\
f(x^{-1})&=&g(x^{-1})

This implies that $x^{-1} \in H$. Now, let $x$ and $y$ be elements in $H$. Then, \begin{eqnarray}
f(x \cdot y) &=& f(x)*f(y)\\
&=& g(x)*g(y)\\
&=& g(x \cdot y)

820636,Logical structure of definitions,"Here are some ""concepts"" that are confusing me: The assertion $x>2$ is true when we replace $x$ by a number greater than $2$($3$ for example) and false if we replace it by $1$. But the assertion $\forall x(x>2)$ is false. In the first case $x$ is free while in the second case $x$ is a bound variable. Now for these two assertions: If $x>2$ then $x>3$.($x$ is understood to be a real number). For every $n$ if $n>2$ then $n>3$. Is the $x$ in the first assertion free while the $n$ in the second assertion bound ? The Handbook of Mathematical Discourse states that in the first assertion $x$ is actually universally quantified like the second assertion. Can someone elaborate on that ? Also, when proving them, their proofs are exactly the same except in the second one we add ""let n be arbitrary""(How to Prove it). So do the two assertions differ in their Logical structure ? Now for definitions : A number is even if it is divisible by $2$. The number is even if it is divisible  by $2$. Is the usage of the and a different in mathematical definitions(sorry for the poor example above, if you have any better example that would be appreciated). Also aren't mathematical definitions assertions ? A number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. Every number $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. I know that a definition is NOT an assertion and thus cannot be true or false(Right ?). The definition just describes a property(ies) of some mathematical object. Now for the above two definitons is $n$ a free variable in the first but bound variable in the second ? Also the second definition can be expressed as $\forall n (n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$. Doesn't that mean that a definition in a sense is true or false since it can be expressed by a logical symbols ? Another definition : Suppose $n$ is an integer. Then $n$ is even if it is divisible by $2$. Where is the location of Suppose $n$ is an integer (a precondition) in the logical structure of a definition(after or before the biarrow) ? $\forall n (n\ is\ an\ integer \rightarrow n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ or $\forall n (n\ is\ an\ integer \land n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ or $\forall n ( n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ an\ integer \land n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$ Also when trying to prove ""$x$ is even"" what exactly should I do ?

Then$ b$ is called an $R$-smallest element of B (or just a smallest element if $R$
is clear from the context) if $∀x ∈ B(bRx)$. How do I express this definiton in logical symbols(are $A$,$b$,$B$, $R$ free or bound?)?What should I do if I want to prove that $z$ is a $H$ smallest element of $M$ ? Suppose $f : A → B$ and $C ⊆ A$. The set $f ∩ (C × B)$, which is a relation

I know that a definition is NOT an assertion and thus cannot be true or false(Right ?). The definition just describes a property(ies) of some mathematical object.

Also the second definition can be expressed as $\forall n (n\ is\ even\  \leftrightarrow n\ is\ divisible\ by\ 2)$. Doesn't that mean that a definition in a sense is true or false since it can be expressed by a logical symbols ? Another definition : Suppose $n$ is an integer.

$\sin^4x + \cos^4 x = (\sin^2 x + \cos^2x)(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x) - 2\sin^2 x\cos^2 x = 1 - 2\sin^2 x\cos^2 x  = (1-\sqrt2\sin x \cos x)(1+\sqrt2\sin x \cos x)$ and then I tried substituting: $t = \sin x \cos x$ and got

Then $\text{Out}(P) \cong GL_2(p)$. My teacher have tried to give me an idea of how we can look at $P$ - as a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $(C_p\times C_p) \rtimes GL_2(p)$. The reasoning is as follows (and I don't fully understand every step, but you will see that): Since $P$ has exponent $p$, we know that every nontrivial element of $P$ has order $p$. We know that $Z(P)\neq 1$ since $P$ is a $p$-group, and since $P$ is nonabelian we know that $Z(P)\neq P$. If we assume that $\vert Z(P)\vert = p^2$ then $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic making $G$ abelian, so we conclude that $\vert Z(P)\vert = p$. Now let $x\in P\backslash Z(P)$ and set $U = Z(P) \langle x\rangle$ Then $U \cong C_p \times C_p$. First question : How do I know that $Z(P) \langle x\rangle \cong C_p \times C_p$. I mean, why is $Z(P)\cap \langle x\rangle = 1$ and how do I know that $Z(P)\langle x\rangle$ is not cyclic? Ok, well $U$ has index $p$ in $P$ and is thus a normal and maximal subgroup of $P$. Let $y\in P\backslash U$. Then $P = U \rtimes \langle y\rangle$. Second question : How do I know this? I mean, I know that $U$ is a normal and maximal subgroup of $P$ and $y\notin U$, so $U \langle y\rangle$ is a subgroup of $P$ containing $U$ properly, ergo $U \langle y\rangle = P$. But why is $U \langle y\rangle = U \rtimes \langle y\rangle$? Proceeding, I realize that $\text{Aut}(U) \cong GL_2(p)$, so $\vert \text{Aut}(U) \vert = p(p-1)(p^2-1)$, so a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $U$ has order $p$. And therefore, we can see $P$ as a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $U\rtimes GL_2(p)$. Third question : How do I get that $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $U\rtimes GL_2(p)$ from the reasoning above?

821157,Conditional Probability - Derivation of Probability Unknown,"Here's a problem from Sheldon Ross's A First Course in Probability that I don't understand: At a certain stage of a criminal investigation, the inspector in charge is 60 percent convinced of the guilt of a certain suspect. Suppose, however, that a new piece of evidence which shows that the criminal has a certain characteristic (such as left-handedness, baldness, or brown hair) is uncovered. If 20 percent of the population possesses this characteristic, how certain of the guilt of the suspect should the inspector now be if it turns out that the suspect has the characteristic? The solution is: Letting $G$ denote the event that the suspect is guilty and $C$ the event that he possesses the characteristic of the criminal, we have
$$
P(G\mid C) = \frac{P(GC)}{P(C)}
= \frac{P(C\mid G)P(G)}{P(C\mid G)P(G) + P(C\mid G^c)P(G^c)}
= \frac{1(0.6)}{1(0.6) + (0.2)(0.4)}
= 0.882
$$ What I don't understand is why $P(C) = P(C\mid G)P(G) + P(C\mid G^c)P(G^c)$. I feel that it should be either 1, if the suspect has the characteristic, else 0.2 if it's unknown. If someone could explain how this is derived, I'd really appreciate it.","['probability', 'conditional-probability']"

If $p$ is a polynomial with coefficients in $S$, then $p$ fixes $S$ (as a function, that is, $p(s)\in S$ for all $s\in S$).  A converse statement is: If $p$ is a polynomial with coefficients in $R$, and $p$ fixes $S$, then the coefficients of $p$ are in $S$. My question: For which pairs $(S,R)$ does this converse hold? Some basic observations: It does not hold for $(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q})$.  For example, $p(x)=\frac12 x(x+1)$ fixes $\mathbb{Z}$ but has non-integer coefficients. A direct generalization is that it does not hold if there exists $s\in S$ which is uninvertible in $S$ but invertible in $R$, and such that $S/sS$ is finite.  For example, it does not hold for $(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt2],\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt2])$ (taking $s=2$, say, or $s=\sqrt2$), nor for $(\mathbb{Z}[\frac12],\mathbb{Q})$ (taking, say, $s=3$).  [Note: There are rings in which every uninvertible element gives rise to infinitely many congruence classes, e.g., $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.] It does hold if $S$ and $R$ are fields of characteristic zero.

That is, $\beta(0,n_2,n_3)=n_2+n_3$ if $n_2 \geq \Delta_{k}:=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ with $k:=n_3-n_2$ and otherwise $\beta(0,n_2,n_3) = \Delta_{k}+(n_2 - \Delta_{k} - 1 \bmod k+1)$. Here are some values of the diagonals $(\beta(i,i+k,i+k+l))_i$ (with fixed $k,l \geq 0$), computed with the help of GAP.

Edit. After some experimentation I have found the following formula (with $k:=n_3-n_2$): $$\beta(n_1,n_2,n_3) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} n_1 + n_2 + n_3 & n_2 \leq \Delta_{k+n_1} \\

\Delta_{k+n_1} + ((n_2 - \Delta_{k+n_1} - 1) \bmod (k+n_1+1)) & n_2 > \Delta_{k+n_1+1} \end{array}\right.$$ I don't have a proof. Also, the formula is only almost correct. For $n_2 > \Delta_{k+n_1+1}$ the formula seems to be fine, but for $n_2 \leq \Delta_{k+n_1+1}$ there are (for fixed $n_1$) a few exceptions.

Apart from these $5$ values, $\beta(1,-,-)$ seems to fit to the formula. For $\beta(2,-,-)$ there are $13$ exceptions, for $\beta(3,-,-)$ there are $19$ of them.

I once saw the following ""near-identity"" in a facebook page $$7(\sqrt{7+\sqrt{7}}-\sqrt{5+\sqrt{5}}) \approx \sqrt{6+\sqrt{6}}$$ So I thought of generating similar near-identities by directly calculating $$E(k) = \frac{\sqrt{k+\sqrt{k}}}{\sqrt{k+1+\sqrt{k+1}}-\sqrt{k-1+\sqrt{k-1}}}$$ and then look for those entries which the expression is almost an integer (for example when k=6 we have $E(6) \approx 6.991418$) Then I got the idea that we can also find near-identities of the form $$N(\sqrt{k+3+\sqrt{k+2}} - \sqrt{k+2+\sqrt{k+1}}) \approx \sqrt{k+1+\sqrt{k}}$$ where $N, k$ is are positive integers, by calculating $$F(k) = \frac{\sqrt{k+1+\sqrt{k}}}{\sqrt{k+3+\sqrt{k+2}}-\sqrt{k+2+\sqrt{k+1}}}$$ and then again look for almost-integer entries. Concretely in this case, my definition of ""almost-integer"" here is that the number is at most 0.001 away from the integer closest to it. Numerical evidence shows that the $k$'s for which $F(k)$ is an almost-integer are $25, 36, 49, 64, 81, \ldots$ which suggest something is at play. After some pattern-guessing, I ended up with the claim in the beginning. Direct graph plotting seems to indicate that $$f(x) = 2x+\sqrt{x}+3 - \Bigg(\frac{\sqrt{x+1+\sqrt{x}}}{\sqrt{x+3+\sqrt{x+2}}-\sqrt{x+2+\sqrt{x+1}}}\Bigg)$$ converges to 0 ""from above"" the x-axis, but that's as far as I can go.

821829,Normal subgroups in $GL_2(\mathbb F_3)$,"I'm searching for all the normal subgroups of $G:=GL_2(\mathbb F_3)$. Till now I found $N:=SL_2(\mathbb F_3)$ subgroup of index $2$, $Q_8$ subgroup of index $6$ and the center $Z:=Z(G)=\{\pm\mathbb I_2\}$ of index $24$. First question: are there other normal subgroups? My attempt : let $M\unlhd G$. Then we have to separate two cases: $Z\le M$ and $Z\nleq M$. In the first case $M$ must be one of the subgroup I've already written. In the latter case, first we note that $N, M\unlhd G\Rightarrow M\cap N\unlhd G\Rightarrow M\cap N\unlhd N$. But $Z=\{\pm\mathbb I\}$ and we know that $g=-\mathbb I$ is the only element of order $2$ in $N$. Hence the condition $Z\nleq M$ means that $M$ doesn't contain any element of order $2$ and so neither $M\cap N$ can contain any element of order $2$. But $|N|=3\cdot2^3$ hence by Cauchy we have that $M\cap N$ must have oder $3$, i.e. $M\cap N\in\operatorname{Syl}_3(N)$. So we would have only one $3$-Sylow in $N$ and this is absurd since we know that $n_3(N)=4$. Thus we conclude that a normal subgroup in $G$ must necessarely be in $\{Z,Q_8,N\}$. Am I right? Is this correct? The following problem is already solved, so you can not look at that. EDIT 2: we know that $\overline N:=N/Z\simeq A_4$; then $G/Z:=\overline G$ acts on $\overline N$ with conjugation:
$$
\gamma:G/Z\longrightarrow\operatorname{Aut}(N/Z)\\xZ\longmapsto\gamma_{xZ}:nZ\mapsto n^xZ
$$
and $\ker(\gamma)=C_{\overline G}(\overline N)=:\overline C$. I have to prove that $|\overline C|=1$. Now $\;\overline C\cap\overline N=Z(\overline N)=Z(A_4)=1$. I know that $\overline N$ contains $8$ element of order $3$ (which corresponds to the $8$ element of order $3$ in $N$ and the $8$ element of order $6$ in $N$) so I deduced that $\overline N$ can't contain any element of order $3$ (but in order to make this precise as it should be, I'd have to prove that $G$ doesn't contain any other element of order $3$ or $6$). Hence $|\overline C|\in\{1,2,4,8\}$ (in fact $|\overline G|=3\cdot2^3$). Now I'm able to show that $|\overline C|=2$ leads to a contradiction (but it's long and I won't write it). Second question: how can I show that $|\overline C|\neq4,8$? Moreover it's clear that $|\overline G:\overline N|=2$ but I can't know how to use it.
