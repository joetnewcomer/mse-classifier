2863717,Check my Proof Please (Complex Analysis),"Question: Let $f$ be an analytic function in an open set $U$. Let $V = \{z \in \mathbb{C} : \overline{z} \in U\}$. Define $g$ on $V$ by $g(z) = \overline{f(\overline{z})}$. Show that $g$ is analytic on $V$ without using the fact that $g$ is holomorphic. Proof Attempt: Choose $z_0 \in V$. Then $\overline{z_0} \in U$. Since $f$ is analytic on $U$, there is an $r > 0$ and a sequence of complex numbers $\{a_n\}_{n = 0}^{\infty}$ such that for $\overline{z} \in D(\overline{z_0}, r)$, we have
$$f(\overline{z}) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n(\overline{z} - \overline{z_0})^n$$
It follows that
$$g(z) = \overline{f(\overline{z})} = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \overline{a_n}(z - z_0)^n$$
for all $z \in D(z_0, r)$. Thus, $g$ is analytic on $V$.","['complex-analysis', 'power-series', 'proof-verification']"

2863813,"Compute the expectation of $X_{\tau}$ and related probability given its SDE $dX_t = X_t\,dt + \sigma \, dB_t$","Suppose there is a stochastic process $X_t$ satisfying the SDE $dX_t = X_t\,dt + \sigma \,dB_t$ where $B_t$ denotes the standard Brownian motion starting from $0$. Let $a<b$ being two real numbers. Define $\tau = \inf\{t:X_t\notin [a,b]\}$ and I want to find $E[X_\tau\mid X_0=x]$. I know one method using Feynman-Kac theorem. Denote $u(t,X_t) = E[X_\tau\mid X_t]$ exploiting its markovian property. Then $u$ is a martingale by Tower property. By Ito's lemma:
$$
du(t,X_t)=u_t\ dt+u_x\ dX_t+\frac{1}{2}u_{xx}\ d[X]_t=(u_t + u_xX_t + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} u_{xx})\ dt + \sigma u_x\ dB_t
$$
So we get the PDE:
\begin{cases}
u_t + xu_x + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} u_{xx}=0\\
u(t,a)=a\\
u(t,b)=b
\end{cases}
Notice $u_t=0$, we simply swich $u(t,x)=u(x)=E[X_\tau\mid X_t=x]$ to get
\begin{cases}
xu_x + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} u_{xx}=0\\
u(a)=a\\
u(b)=b
\end{cases}
Solve this and we get
$$
u(x)=a\frac{\int_x^{b}e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx} + b\frac{\int_a^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}
$$
Since $u(x)$ should have a form like
$$
u(x)=aP(X_\tau=a) + bP(X_\tau=b)
$$
Is it safe to guess $P(X_\tau=a \mid X_t=x)=\frac{\int_x^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}$ and $P(X_\tau=b \mid X_t=x)=\frac{\int_a^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}$? My reason is that it seems very reasonable if $x$ increases from $a$ to $b$, $X_\tau$ varies from $a$ and more and more likely becomes $b$ when $x$ increases. Besides, $\frac{\int_a^x e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx} + \frac{\int_x^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}{\int_a^b e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}\ dx}=1$. I generally have three questions: How to justify $P(X_\tau = a) + P(X_\tau = b) = 1$, namely $P(\tau = \infty) = 0$? How to justify $P(X_\tau = a)$ and $P(X_\tau = b)$ happen to be the coefficient of $a$ and $b$ in the expression of $u(x)$? I also learned a technique to compute this type of problem by constructing martingales like $B_t^2-t$ when we compute the exit time of Brownian motion. Is there similar way to solve this problem? I notice $e^{-t}X_t$ is a martingale but don't know how to proceed. Thank you for any help!","['stochastic-processes', 'expectation', 'martingales', 'probability']"

2863907,characteristic classes arising from connections are well-defined,"I am reading an excerpt from Morita's book. The story is that if you have a connection $\nabla$ on a vector bundle $E$ over some manifold $M$ and a function $M_n(\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{R}$ which is a homogeneous polynomial invariant under conjugation, then you obtain a form on $M$ by applying $f$ to the curvature matrix $\Omega$. What needs to be shown is that $f(\Omega)$ is a closed form, and that $[f(\Omega)]$ doesn't depend on the connection you started with. The second part is what I'm having trouble with. What Morita does is suppose we are given connections $\nabla^0$ and $\nabla^1$ on $E$. Consider the bundle $E\times\mathbb{R}\to M\times\mathbb{R}$ and define a connection $\tilde{\nabla}$ on $E\times \mathbb{R}$ in the following way. Suppose $s$ is a section of $E\times\mathbb{R}$ which is independent of $t$ (that is, $s(p,t) = s(p,t')$ for all $t, t'$). Then define $\tilde{\nabla}_{\frac{\partial}{\partial t}} s = 0$ and 
$$
\tilde{\nabla}_X s = (1-t)\nabla_X^0 s + t\nabla_X^1 s 
$$
for $X\in T_{(p,t)}(M\times\mathbb{R})$. I understand that every vector field on $M\times \mathbb{R}$ can be written as a linear combination with function coefficients of $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$ and vector fields which are tangent to $M\times \{t\}$. Morita says that also every section of $E\times \mathbb{R}$ can be written as a linear combination with function coefficients of sections which are independent of $t$. I don't see why this is true. Moreover, aren't you supposed to be feeding connections vector fields and not tangent vectors? Is the point here that a vector field on $M\times\mathbb{R}$ which is tangent to $M\times \{t\}$ can be considered as a vector field on $M$?","['connections', 'vector-bundles', 'characteristic-classes', 'differential-geometry']"
2863921,Cellular Automata on the Collatz Conjecture,"I have a Cellular Automaton that of any initial integer (initial condition of the automaton) generates states of Collatz sequences. The neighbourhood of the automaton is shaped like an L-tetromino (including two time-states). The (quiescent) background is represented as $0$ (the state zero). The other $1$-state (on-state) generates active border on the left side during the generation of the automaton. The border is the interesting part because that is where the ""currect"" generation either increases (is odd), are still (is odd) or decreases (is even). My earlier post on the matter was closed due to my question being unclear. I have found out that if I can write a paper about this (or get somebody to help me writing it - helping me with terminology and such), we could represent the ($3n+1$) Collatz-problem with an Cellular Automaton (or Adaptive Cellular Automaton), and someone could approach the problem from that standpoint; like for example, Matthew Cook proved that Rule 110 was Turing Complete (i.e universal); and an undergraduate from UK proved that a $2,3$ Turing machine was universal. I have a feeling that we might perhaps find out if the conjecture is true, false or unprovable by solving some properties of this automaton. Since now the Collatz Conjecture is represented as a Cellular Automaton, I think we can make one or more conjectures; one that either indirectly proves or disproves the conjecture, or one that gives us some information about its behaviour or if its undecidable. I have not been able to reach out to the mathematics community with my Cellular Automaton on the Collatz conjecture, and I don't know if it allready exists (that is; if someone else have allready done it), I have not yet found a paper that looks similiar to my representation (on an binary integer lattice using L-tetromino shaped neighbourhood). On the automaton: I think convergence is difficult to prove in a Cellular Automaton, but it might be possible depending on the neighbourhood, rule and CA-setup perhaps. I think maybe proving that the paths that the neighbourhood takes (Transition Function) reaches some boundary (or not) will prove that the Conjecture is true or not. It's hard for me to actually describe what I mean about this. Please, if anyone have tried this before? I would like to hear more about it. Anyone how knows about information, or a paper on this specifically I would like to know. My question is; does there allready exists a conjecture on the Collatz in the form of an Cellular Automaton, and such that if something about it can be proven true or false - it will also prove if the original Conjecture is true or false?

$$
\mid 1+z\mid^2+\mid 1-z\mid^2

for (arbitrary) complex $z$ lying on the unit circle. This evaluates to $4$. Consider the triangle $0,1+z,1-z$ and shift it to the left by $1$. We get a triangle inscribed in a circle with one of its sides lying on a diagonal. Conversely, if we start with any triangle inscribed in a circle lying on a diagonal we can embed the figure in $\mathbb{C}$, so that the image of the circle is the unit circle, and the vertices of the triangle are $-1,z,-z$ for some $z\in\mathbb{C}$. Now, shift the triangle to the right by 1. Two of its sides become $1+z$ and $1-z$. Our computation shows that this triangle is a right triangle. This result is known as the Thales's theorem.

This was my (failed) attempt to solve this problem. Suppose that $X \simeq \{c\}$. Pick a point $p \in X$. We want to show that there exists a retract $r : X \to\{p\}$ such that for the map $i_{\{p\}} : \{p\} \to X$ defined by $i_{\{p\}} (p) = p$ we have $i_{\{p\}}  \circ r \simeq \text{Id}_X$. Let $r : X \to \{p\}$ be defined by $r(x) = p$ for all $x \in X$. We claim that this is the required retraction. Then $i_{\{p\}} \circ r =r$. So the problem boils down to showing that $r \simeq \text{Id}_X$. Now since $X \simeq \{c\}$, there exist continuous maps $f : X \to \{c\}$ and $g : \{c\} \to X$ such that $f \circ g \simeq \text{Id}_{\{c\}}$ and $g \circ f \simeq \text{Id}_{X}$. Now note that there can only be one such map $f$, the map defined by $f(x) = c$ for all $x \in X$ (which is trivially continuous). At this point I figured that if I showed that $r \simeq g \circ f$, then I'd arrive at $r \simeq \text{Id}_X$. But for any $x \in X$ we have $(g\circ f) (x) = g(f(x)) = g(c)$ and since we don't know exactly what function $g$ is, $g(c)$ could be anything. Now I'd have to define an explicit homotopy betwen $r$ and $g \circ f$ but I'm not sure how to do that. Intuitively I need to find some way to continuously 'move' $g(c)$ to $p$ in $X$ via this homotopy, and usually if $X$ is convex then this can be done using a straight line homotopy.

$ \mathbb{P}(\|\mathbf{x}\|^2 \geq t\cdot n) \leq e^{-t\cdot n/10}$ However somewhere else I have seen the following tail bound for the $\chi^2$-distribution:$ \mathbb{P}(\|\mathbf{x}\|^2 \geq t\cdot 2n) \leq e^{-t\cdot n/10}$ Which of two tail bounds for the $\chi^2$-distribution is correct and can we prove that using the Gaussian tail bound that I gave in the beginning?","['chi-squared', 'probability', 'upper-lower-bounds']"

Therefore I calculate the functions sobolev norm $$\|f\|_s^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi^2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}(1+\| u\|)^s |\mathscr{F}f(u)|^2du$$ Since for its fourier transform holds $\mathscr{F}f(u) = (1+\|u\|^2)^{-1}$, we consider $$\|f\|_s^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}(1+\|u\|^2)^{s-2}du$$. Now I want to show two things: for $s=\frac{3}{2}$, this integral is not finite (and therefore obviously not for bigger $s$ and secondly, that this is finite for $s<\frac{3}{2}$. I proved the first part as following: $$\|f\|_s^2 =  \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}(1+\|u\|^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}du

Munkres, 2nd edition: What are the components and the path components of $\mathbb{R}_l$ ? What are the continuous maps $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_l$ ? My Attempt: First of all, we note that $\mathbb{R}_l$ denotes the set of real numbers with the topology having as a basis all the open intervals of the form $(a, b) = \{ \ x \in \mathbb{R} \ \colon \ a < x < b \ \}$ , where $a$ and $b$ are any real numbers such that $a<b$ , and all the closed-open intervals $[c, d) = \{ c \} \cup (c, d)$ , where $c$ and $d$ are any real numbers such that $c < d$ . Refer to Sec. 13 in Munkres. Now let $A$ be a set in $\mathbb{R}_l$ consisting of more than one points. Let $a, b \in A$ such that $a < b$ . Then $a \in (-\infty, b)$ and $b \in [b, +\infty)$ ; these two rays are disjoint and their union is all of $\mathbb{R}$ ; moreover these rays are open in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . So $A \cap (-\infty, b)$ and $A \cap [b, +\infty)$ is a separation of $A$ . Thus $A$ is not connnected. Thus we have shown that every set of real numbers having more than one point fails to be connected in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . In other words, the only nonempty connected  sets in $\mathbb{R}_l$ are the singleton sets of real numbers. Since each component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be connected [Refer to Theorem 25.1 in Munkres.], we can conclude from the preceding paragraph that each component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ is a singleton set. And, since each path component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be contained in a component [Refer to Theorem 25.5 in Munkres.], we can conclude from the preceding paragraph that each path component of $\mathbb{R}_l$ must be a singleton set too. Finally let the map $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}_l$ be continuous. Then since $\mathbb{R}$ is connected, so should be $f ( \mathbb{R})$ [Refer to Theorem 23.5 in Munkres.], and therefore $f ( \mathbb{R})$ must be a singleton set in $\mathbb{R}_l$ . This shows that $f$ is constant. Is this solution correct? If so, is it clear enough too, especially for a beginning student? If not, then where are the issues?","['path-connected', 'general-topology', 'proof-verification', 'connectedness']"

2864412,Why does Lang describe a field as a union and compositum of its subfields in this manner?,"I am reading Serge Lang's Algebra , revised 3rd edition, and on page 226, the author makes the following definitions and observations: If $E,F \subset L$ , the compositum of $E$ and $F$ in $L$ is defined to be the smallest subfield of $L$ containing both $E$ and $F$ . It is denoted $EF$ . If $k \subset E$ and $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n \in E$ , then $k(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ is defined to be the smallest subfield of $E$ containing $k$ and $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n$ . Observe that $$ E = \bigcup k(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n), $$ where the union is taken over all finite families $\{ \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n \}$ of elements of $E$ . The compositum of an arbitrary family of subfields of a field $L$ is defined as the smallest subfield of $L$ containing all fields in the family. $E$ is finitely generated over $k$ if there is a finite family $\{ \alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n \}$ of elements of $E$ such that $E = k(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)$ . Observe that $E$ is the compositum of all its finitely generated subfields over $k$ . My question is regarding the two observations (point nos. 3 and 6). It appears to me that it is enough to take union (and compositum) over all subfields generated by a single element. For example for point no. 3, I can write $$
E = \bigcup_{\alpha \in E} k(\alpha)
$$ because $E$ is clearly contained in the RHS, and each $k(\alpha)$ is contained in $E$ and hence so is the union, implying that $E$ contains the RHS. Similarly for point no. 6. So, why does Lang emphasise to take the union and compositum over all finitely generated subfields? Is there some perspective that he wishes to emphasise that I am missing?

Show that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ lie in the same component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ if and only if the sequence $$ \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} = \left( x_1 - y_1, x_2 - y_2, \ldots \right) $$ 
  is bounded. [ Hint: It suffices to consider the case where $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0}$.] My Attempt: First of all, we note that $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ denotes the set of all the (infinite) sequences of real numbers; that is, $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ denotes the countably infinite Cartesian product 
  $$ \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \cdots. $$ And, the uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ is the one induced by the so-called uniform metric on $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, which is given by 
  $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} ) \colon= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - y_n \right\rvert, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} $$
  for all $\mathbf{x} \colon= \left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathbf{y} \colon= \left( y_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Now let $\mathbf{a} \colon= \left( a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\mathbf{b} \colon= \left( b_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be any two points in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that the sequence $$ \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \left( a_n - b_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$$
  is bounded, that is, such that there exists a positive real number $r$ such that 
  $$ \left\lvert a_n - b_n \right\rvert \leq r \ \mbox{ for all } \ n \in \mathbb{N}. \tag{1} $$
  Now let $f \colon [ 0, 1 ] \to \mathbb{R}^\omega$ be the map defined by 
  $$ f(t) \colon= \mathbf{a} + t(\mathbf{b}- \mathbf{a} ) = \big( a_n + t \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \ \mbox{ for all } \ t \in [0, 1].  $$
  Then for any points $s, t \in [0, 1]$, we note that 
  $$
\begin{align}
\bar{\rho}( f(s), f(t) ) &= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \big\lvert \big( a_n + s \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big) - \big( a_n + t \left( b_n - a_n \right) \big)  \big\rvert, \, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\
&= \sup \left\{ \ \min \left\{ \ \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert, \, 1 \ \right\} \ \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\
&\leq \sup \left\{ \ \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\
&= \lvert s-t \rvert \cdot \sup \left\{ \ \left\lvert b_n - a_n \right\rvert \colon \ n \in \mathbb{N} \ \right\} \\
&\leq \lvert s-t \rvert r \qquad \mbox{ [ using (1) above ]}.
\end{align} 
$$
  So, given any real number $\varepsilon > 0$, if we choose our real number $\delta$ such that $$ 0 < \delta < \frac{\varepsilon}{r}, $$
  then we find that 
  $$ \bar{\rho}( f(s), f(t) ) < \varepsilon $$
  holds for any pair of points $s, t \in [0, 1]$ for which $$ \lvert s-t \rvert < \delta. $$
  Thus the map $f$ is continuous (in fact uniformly continuous). Moreover, $f(0) = \mathbf{a}$ and $f(1) = \mathbf{b}$. Therefore $f$ is a path in the uniform space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ joining the points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$. So $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in the same path component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. And since each path component of any topological space is contained in a component of that space, we can conclude that $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in the same component of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Am I right? Can we give an independent proof of the above without having recourse to path components? Now suppose that the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is unbounded. Then, for any natural number $k$, there exists a natural number $n_k$ such that 
  $$ \left\lvert a_{n_k} - b_{n_k} \right\rvert > k. $$ Now let $U$ be the set of all the points $\mathbf{x} \colon= \left( x_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{x}$ is bounded. Then $\mathbf{a} \in U$. Moreover, If $\mathbf{u} \colon= \left( u_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \in U$, then the sequence $\left( a_n - u_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is bounded; that is, there exists a positive real number $r_\mathbf{u}$ such that 
  $$ \left\lvert a_n - u_n \right\rvert < r_\mathbf{u} \ \mbox{ for all } \ n \in \mathbb{N}. $$
  So if $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$ and if $\mathbf{x}$ is any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} ) < \varepsilon, $$
  then, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have 
  $$ 
\min\big\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert, \ 1 \ \big\} \leq \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} ) < \varepsilon < 1, 
$$
  and so 
  $$ 
\min\big\{ \ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert, \  1 \big\} = \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert,
$$
  and thus 
  $$ \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert < \varepsilon. $$
  Then, for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we obtain
  $$ 
\begin{align}
\left\lvert x_n - a_n \right\rvert &\leq \left\lvert x_n - u_n \right\rvert + \left\lvert u_n - a_n \right\rvert \\
&< \varepsilon + r_\mathbf{u}. 
\end{align}
$$
  thus showing that $\mathbf{x} \in U$ also. Therefore $U$ is open in the uniform space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Now the point $\mathbf{b}$ is in the set $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Let $\mathbf{v}$ be any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Then the sequence $\left( v_n - a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded; so for any natural number $k$ there exists a natural number $m_k$ such that 
  $$ \left\lvert v_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert > k. $$
  Now if $\varepsilon \in (0, 1)$, and if $\mathbf{y}$ is any point of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that 
  $$ \bar{\rho}( \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{v} ) < \varepsilon, $$
   then as before we must have 
  $$ \left\lvert y_n - v_n \right\rvert < \varepsilon $$
  for every natural number $n$. Now if $\lambda$ is an arbitrary real number and if $k$ is a natural number such that $k > \lambda + \varepsilon$, then we find that 
  $$
\begin{align}
\left\lvert y_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert &\geq  \left\lvert v_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert  -  \left\lvert y_{m_k} - v_{m_k} \right\rvert  \\
&> k - \varepsilon \\
&> \lambda.
\end{align}
$$
  Thus corresponding to any real number $\lambda$, no matter how large, we can find a natural number $m_k$ such that 
  $$ \left\lvert y_{m_k} - a_{m_k} \right\rvert > \lambda. $$
  Thus the sequence $\left( y_n - a_n \right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded, which shows that $\mathbf{y}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Therefore the set $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ is also open in the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Thus the sets $U$ and $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ constitute a separation of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$. Moreover, these two sets are both open and closed in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ with the uniform topology. Finally, if $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are any two points of $U$. then the sequences $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}$  and $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{a}$ are both bounded; so the sequence $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} = ( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a} ) - ( \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{a} )$ is bounded as well. Thus $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ are in the same (path) component of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, as has been shown above. Thus the set $U$ is (path) connected. Similarly, the set $V$ of all the points $\mathbf{v}$ in $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ such that $\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{b}$ is bounded is (path) connected. Moreover, $\mathbf{b}$ is in $V$ but $\mathbf{a}$ is not in $V$. Also $V$ is both open and closed in the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, just as $U$ has been shown to be both open and closed. Moreover, the sets $U$ and $V$ are disjoint. I'm getting lost now! What next? How to proceed from here? Or, is there anywhere I've gone wrong? P.S.: I think I've just managed to hit upon the right trick! Now as the sets $U$ and $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$ form a separation of the uniform metric space $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, so any connected subspace lies in either $U$ or $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$, but not both. [Refer to Lemma 23.2 in Munkres.] As $\mathbf{a} \in U$, so the component containing $\mathbf{a}$, which is of course a connected subspace of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$, must also lie in $U$. And, as $\mathbf{b}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$, so the component containing $\mathbf{b}$ lies in $\mathbb{R}^\omega \setminus U$. Therefore the points $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ lie in different components of $\mathbb{R}^\omega$ in the uniform topology if the sequence $\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}$ is unbounded. Is there any flaw in my reasoning?","['connectedness', 'path-connected', 'proof-verification', 'alternative-proof', 'general-topology']"

2864940,Why is cardinality considered to capture the notion of size?,"First of all let me say that I find it difficult to articulate exactly what it is I want to ask, but I will try to be as precise as I can. I'll start by clarifying I'm not trying to ask about what cardinality is , or why it is useful/interesting. What is bothering me is that when talking about sets, the words ""cardinality"" and ""size"" are treated as synonyms, and I've realized I'm not sure why that is a good idea, especially when concerning students new to the concept of cardinality. To help you understand where I'm coming from, when I first learned about cardinality I struggled with it a lot. It just didn't make sense. Everything seemed rife with paradoxes and nonsensical results. In retrospect I realize that the moment I began to become comfortable with cardinality was the moment I abandoned any association I had of it to what my mind thought ""size"" should mean and instead began looking at it as simply being about bijections which obviously acted like bijections should. To give an example, before I was educated about cardinalities, if I was asked how many even numbers there are compared to natural numbers, or positives compared to reals, I'd probably answer ""half as much"", and I suspect that's not uncommon. Obviously that answer is wrong from the perspective of cardinalities, but isn't that evidence that cardinality just doesn't behave like something that fits our common ideas of what a ""size"" is? Perhaps we could come up with a different notion of size where those 'intuitive' answers do make sense? Personally, I feel like when I use the word size I think of concepts like distance, mass, or volume. Cardinality seems like it fits the notion of ""isomorphism of sets"" more than anything else. So to sum up the question: is there a good reason why we'd want to actively associate the notion of ""cardinality"" primarily with the word/concept of ""size""? Or is it perhaps a mostly historical remnant that does more pedagogic harm than good?","['elementary-set-theory', 'soft-question']"
2864970,"Let Y be a normed linear space show Y is Banach if and only if there exists Banach X and linear, open, cts T:X -> Y","I want to show the following: Let $Y$ be a normed linear space. Show $Y$ is a Banach space if and only if there exists a Banach space $X$ and a linear, continuous, open, and onto mapping $T: X \rightarrow Y$. One direction is straightforward: If $Y $ is Banach, take $X = Y, T = Id$, which is linear, open, continuous and onto. My proof for the other direction has one line that I believe is false, which I mark with (***).
I'm using a theorem that states that if T(X) is closed, then $$ \exists M > 0 \text{ s.t. } \forall y \in T(X), \exists x \in X \text{ s.t. } Tx = y \text{ and } \|x \| \le M \| y \|. $$
Suppose $\{y_k\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in Y. Define $\tilde{y}_1 = y_1, \tilde{y}_k = y_k - y_{k-1}$. By open mapping theorem, $T(X)=Y$ is closed. Now find $\tilde{x}_k$ s.t. $T\tilde{x}_k = \tilde{y}_k \text{ and } \|\tilde{x}_k \| \le M \| \tilde{y}_k \|$.  Since $y_k$ is Cauchy, $\| \tilde{y}_k \| = \|y_k - y_{k-1}\|$ can be made arbitrarily small for large enough k. Hence $\tilde{x}_k \rightarrow 0$ in $X$. 
Define $x_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \tilde{x}_i$. Now note that $y_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \tilde{y}_i = \sum_{i=1}^k T\tilde{x}_i = T(\sum_{i=1}^k \tilde{x}_i) = Tx_k$. (***) $\|x_m - x_n\| = \|\sum_{i=n+1}^m \tilde{x}_i \|= \sum_{i=n+1}^m\| \tilde{x}_i \|$. This shows that $\{x_k\}$ is Cauchy, hence converges to some $x\in X$. Since $T$ is onto $y:=Tx$ is in $Y$. By continuity, $y_k = T x_k \rightarrow T x  = y$. Hence Y is complete.","['banach-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'normed-spaces', 'functional-analysis', 'linear-transformations']"

 $$2^x\Bigl(2^x-1\Bigl) + \frac{2^x}{2}\Bigl(\frac{2^x}{2} -1 \Bigl) + .... + \frac{2^x}{2^{99}} \Bigl(\frac{2^x}{2^{99}} - 1 \Bigl)= 0$$

Now the inside can be expressed as $$\sum ^ {n= 99} _{n=1} a_n$$ Where $a_n$ are the terms of the GP. Thus we can see that either $$-2^x= 0$$ Or, $$\sum ^ {n= 99} _{n=1} a_n = 0$$

2865316,How does this proof of the regular dodecahedron's existence fail?,"On Tim Gowers' webpage he has an example "" proof "" of the regular dodecahedron's existence which he claims contains a flaw. He writes Of course, I have not written the above proof in a totally formal way. My question is, where would the difficulty arise if I tried to do so? which suggests to me that he believes the proof contains a serious flaw that can't be fixed by simply adding more detail. However I can't detect any such error. So how does the proof fail? To prevent the possibility of link-rot, the entire argument is as follows. Why isn't it obvious that a regular dodecahedron exists? What is wrong with the following argument for the existence of a
regular dodecahedron, an argument which is supposed to describe what
one actually does when making one out of cardboard? Draw a regular
pentagon in the plane, and surround it by five further regular
pentagons of the same size, each one sharing a different edge with the
original pentagon. Now fold these upwards, all by the same angle,
until they just touch each other, so that you have a sort of cup. The
top of this cup consists of ten edges, two for each of the five
further pentagons, that zigzag round roughly in a circle. Let us label the original pentagon A and the five subsequent ones
B,C,D,E and F, ordered cyclically. The upper corners of the zigzag make an angle of exactly 108, the
angle of a regular pentagon, since each one is formed by two edges of
one of B,C,D,E or F. I claim that the same is true for the lower
corners. This can be seen as follows. Consider the corner of the
zigzag at the top of the edge e shared by B and C. If you reflect in
the plane P that bisects the edge e, then the angle in question
becomes one of the five angles of the base pentagon A. Therefore it is
108. Hence, there is a regular pentagon G, of the same size as all the
other ones, which shares an edge with B and an edge with C. This
argument works for the four other lower corners of the zigzag, giving
pentagons H, I, J and K (again, let us say, in cyclic order and going
round the same way as B, C, D, E and F). It is important to show that these pentagons fit together in the sense
that G shares an edge with H, which shares an edge with I, and so on.
This can again be done by reflecting in the plane P. It is not a bad
idea to draw a picture at this point, but if you reflect in P, then G
maps to A, and H maps to a pentagon that shares an edge with A and C,
which means that it must be B or D. Since B maps to itself, H maps to
D, which shares an edge with A. Thus, the reflected images of G and H
share an edge, which implies that G and H share an edge (which can
easily be checked by a more careful version of the above argument to
be the right edge). By symmetry, we conclude that the pentagons G, H, I, J and K all fit
together as they should. Every edge is now shared by two pentagons
except for one edge each of G, H, I, J and K. By symmetry once again
(rotating through 108 about a line through the bottom pentagon and
perpendicular to it) these lines form a regular pentagon. To see that the symmetry group of the resulting shape is transitive in
all the ways one wants, notice that, once we had chosen the bottom
pentagon, there was no choice about how to choose all the rest, given
the rule that two neighbours of a given pentagon sharing adjacent
edges were required to share a further edge with each other. Hence, we
could have started the process at any of the other pentagons and would
have obtained the same shape. Therefore, any isometry of R^3 that maps
one of the faces to another, with the outer and inner sides mapping to
the outer and inner sides respectively, can be extended to a symmetry
of the entire shape. Of course, I have not written the above proof in a totally formal way.
My question is, where would the difficulty arise if I tried to do so?","['euclidean-geometry', 'polyhedra', 'geometry', 'fake-proofs', 'platonic-solids']"

Then $B_1,B_2,\dotsc$ is disjoint and $\bigcup^\infty A_i=\bigcup^\infty B_i$. Now I'm curious if this works given an arbitrary collection of sets $A_i$, $i\in I$, where $I$ is ANY index set. I'm thinking, why not take steal the structure of the original index set for the new one? Define $J=I$ and $B_j=A_i$ for some $j\in J$ and any $i\in I$, then define $B_k=A_l\setminus\bigcup_j B_j$ where for every new $B_k$ defined, $l\in I$ s.t. $l$ not already chosen and $j$ ranges over the $B_j$ already defined.

If I were to solely consider the monthly exchange rates over the interval [a,b] where: a=02/01/18 b=07/01/18 Is it possible to model a function whereby I can then use to determine the average value of this function over this interval? I'd ultimately integrate this function to find its average-value using: $$1/5\int_0^5 F(x)dx = Yav$$ Where F(x) represents the modeled function over interval [a,b], and Yav represents the average value. I usually determine the current average monthly rate of an exchange rate by taking its previous 5 monthly candlesticks' high to low difference, adding them, then dividing the sum by 5. I feel this is the simple approach. Is modeling such a function too overly complicated? I'm still learning about integration, so please excuse any terms I might have gotten wrong.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'mathematical-modeling', 'graphing-functions', 'functions']"

2865791,"On the integrals $\int_0^\infty [1-x^n \operatorname{arccot}^n(x)] \, \mathrm{d} x$","When answering this question I came across the integrals $$ I_n \equiv \int \limits_0^\infty [1-x^n \operatorname{arccot}^n(x)] \, \mathrm{d} x \, , ~n \in \mathbb{N} \, . $$ I needed $I_1 = \frac{\pi}{4}$ , $I_2 = \frac{\pi}{6}[2 \ln(2)+1]$ and $I_3 = \frac{\pi}{32}[32 \ln(2)+ 4 -\pi^2]$ in my answers. They can be evaluated by writing
$$ I_n = \lim_{r \to \infty} \left[r - \int \limits_0^r x^n \operatorname{arccot}^n (x) \, \mathrm{d} x \right] $$
and using repeated integration by parts to reduce the remaining integral to a few terms that cancel the $r$ in the limit and some well-known integrals. This calculation should work for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, but it gets more tedious for larger values of course. Mathematica gives reasonably nice expressions for the integrals in terms of $\pi$ , $\ln(2)$ and values of the zeta function (for example $I_4 = \frac{\pi}{40} [4 + 80 \ln(2) - \pi^2 (3 + 4 \ln(2)) + 18 \zeta(3)]$), so it might be possible to evaluate the integrals in terms of suitable special functions in general. However, I have not yet found a way to transform them into such an expression. The obvious substitution $x = \cot (t)$ leads to
$$ I_n = \int \limits_0^{\pi/2} \frac{\sin^n (t) - t^n \cos^n (t)}{\sin^{n+2}(t)} \, \mathrm{d} t \, ,$$
which does not seem to help much. We can use
$$ 1 - a^n = (1-a) \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-1} a^k = \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum \limits_{l=0}^k (-1)^l {k \choose l} (1-a)^{l+1} $$
for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a \in \mathbb{R}$ to obtain
$$ I_n = \sum \limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum \limits_{l=0}^k (-1)^l {k \choose l} J_{l+1} $$
in terms of
$$ J_n \equiv \int \limits_0^\infty [1-x \operatorname{arccot}(x)]^n \, \mathrm{d} x \, , ~n \in \mathbb{N} \, . $$
Interchanging the sums, using $\sum_{k=l}^{n-1} {k \choose l} = {n \choose l+1}$ (which apparently is known as the hockey-stick identity ) and defining $I_0 = J_0 = 0$ , we find that the two sequences are binomial transforms of each other (except for a minus sign):
$$I_n = - \sum \limits_{m=0}^n (-1)^m {n \choose m} J_m \, , \, n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \, . $$
I do not know which of the two families of integrals is easier to evaluate though. Note that the same method enables us to compute
$$ \int \limits_0^\infty [1-x \operatorname{arccot}(x)] P[x \operatorname{arccot}(x)] \, \mathrm{d} x  $$
for any polynomial $P$ once we know $(I_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ or $(J_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. I am also interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the integrals. Numerical calculations and plots suggest that we have
\begin{align}
I_n &\sim \sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{3}} \, , \, n \to \infty \, , \\ 
J_n &\sim \frac{2}{\pi n} \, , \, n \to \infty \, ,
\end{align}
but I have no idea how to prove that. Therefore I am left with the following two questions: How can we find a closed-form expression for $I_n$ or $J_n$ , $n \in \mathbb{N}$ ? What can we say about the asymptotics of $I_n$ or $J_n$ as $n \to \infty$ ? Any hints or (partial) solutions to either of them would be greatly appreciated.","['integration', 'calculus', 'definite-integrals', 'asymptotics']"
2865808,What is the rigorous definition of $dy$ and $dx$?,"Some background: I am a third year undergrad. I have completed two courses on Real Analysis (I have studied $\epsilon$-$\delta$ definitions of limit, continuity, differentiability, Reimann integration and basic topology of $\mathbb{R}$). This semester I have enrolled in our first differential equation course. This is not the first time I am studying DE. In high school, we studied first-order ODE: separation of variables, homogenous DEs, linear first-order DEs and Bernoulli's differential equation. There was a common theme in solution of most of these DEs, the author would somehow manipulate the DE to arrive at an equation of the following form: $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$, then, they would integrate both sides to obtain the solution.  I never understood what the equation $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$ meant, since, the only place where we were introduced to the symbols $dx$ and $dy$ was the definition of derivative: $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ and integraition $\int f(x)dx$. Note that in these definitions, neither $dx$ nor $dy$ occurs on its own separately, they either occur with each other (in the case of derivative) or with $\int f$ (in the case of integral). As a high school student, I was never satisfied with this way of solving DEs but I soon convinced myself that this was correct because it seemed impossible to solve certain DEs without abusing this notation. And, very often, the DEs would already be in the form containing $dx$ and $dy$ separately. Now, in the current course, I was expecting that we would be taught a mathematically rigorous way of solving DEs, but I was disappointed after reading first few sections in the recommended textbooks. The books are Simmons' Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes and Ross' Differential Equations . In section 7, Simmons writes: The simplest of the standard types is that in which the variables are separable:
  $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$$As we know, to solve this we have only to write it in the separated form $dy/h(y) = g(x)dx$ and integrate ... Similarly, Ross also uses $dy$ and $dx$ freely without defining what they mean. In section 2.1, Ross writes: The first-order differential equations to be studied in this chapter may be expressed in either the derivative form $$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)$$ or the differential form $$M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy = 0$$ Thus, I would like to ask the following questions: What is the rigorous definition of $dx$ and $dy$? How do we conclude from $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = k$ that $dy = k dx ?$ Since, we integrate both sides after arriving at the form $f(x)dx = g(y)dy$, does it mean that $f(x)dx$ and $g(y)dy$ are integrable (possibly, Reimann) functions? If so, how do we show that? What does Ross mean by differential form ? Wikipedia gives me something related to differential geometry and multivariable calculus, what has that got to do with ODEs? Why do all authors don't care to define $dx$? I have seen undergrad texts on number theory which begin by defining divisibility, grad texts on Fourier analysis which define what Reimann integration means. And yet, we have introductory texts on ODEs which do not have enough content on something which to me appears to be one of the most common method to solve first-order ODEs. Why is this so? Do authors assume that the reader has already studied that in an earlier course? Should I have studied this in the Real Analysis course? Finally, is there any textbook which takes an axiomatic approach to solving DEs? I understand that some authors want to spend more time discussing motivation behind DEs: their origin in the physics, their applications in economics etc. But I believe I already have enough motivation to study DEs: in the first year I had to take classical mechanics, in which I studied many types DEs, including second-order DEs for harmonic oscillator and I also had to take quantum chemistry in which I studied PDEs like the classical wave equation and Schrodinger equation. In Terry Tao's language, I believe I am past the pre-rigorous phase of DEs, and what I expect from an undergrad course is an axiomatic treatment of the subject. What is a good textbook which serves this purpose? EDIT: I did go through a similar question . But I am not looking for a way to completely do away with the so called differentials $dx$ and $dy$, because, that would make solving certain DEs very difficult. Rather, I am looking for a rigorous theory, which formalizes operations like taking $dx$ to the other side and integrating both sides .","['reference-request', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

2865822,Proving that the derivative always diverges faster than the original function,"Let $f$ be a differentiable real function. What is the simplest/neatest way of proving that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty$ implies that $ \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \infty$? It seems like such a simple statement that perhaps there is even a proof that avoids equations altogether? (Note that $a$ is a finite number.) Here is the one I came up with so far, which works by proving that integrating $\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$ in the vicinity of $x = a$ blows up. Indeed, $\int \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} \mathrm d x = \int \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d x} \left( \ln f(x) \right) \mathrm dx = \ln f(x) + c$, and then we can use the fact that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty$ implies that $\lim_{x \to a} \ln f(x) = \infty$. EDIT: the above statement is not true! The catch is that $f'/f$ might not have a well-defined limit. The best one can show is that $f'/f$ is unbounded in any neighbourhood of $a$. (See RRL's answer for the proof, and Euler's answer for a counter-example to the  original statement.)","['integration', 'singularity', 'derivatives', 'real-analysis']"
2865842,Irregular analogue of cube and octahedron.,"If we take a Dodecahedron and remove the constraint that the pentagonal faces have to be regular pentagons, we get a solid called a Tetartoid . If we take the dual of that, we will end up with the corresponding irregular Icosahedron. Similarly, there seems to be an irregular analogue for the tetrahedron. However, I've never seen one for the cube and octahedron (which happen to be dual of each other). Is it even possible to have irregular analogues of those two? The criterion is that the solid should be convex with all faces identical and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. The cube analogue would have six faces which were all quadrilaterals while the octahedron analogue would have eight faces which were all scalene triangles. EDIT: Actually the Icosahedral object might not necessarily be composed of identical triangles.","['solid-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry', 'platonic-solids']"
