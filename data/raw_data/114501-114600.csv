1673097,Application of Riemann roch-Calculation of index,"Sorry for an ambiguous title. Let me know if you can think of anything better please! Trying to figure out the reason for an equality from a paper. Let $k$ be a function field over a finite field (namely a global function field) and let $A=\prod_PP^{v_P(A)}$ be a sufficiently large divisor of $k$ such that $\mathbb{A}_k=k+\prod_P{P}^{-v_P(A)}.$ (This is possible as Adeles over global field is compact.) Then we are supposed to have $[k\cap \prod_P P^{-v_P(A)}:0]=$deg$(A)$ ""by Riemann-Roch"" which I don't quite see. I see that right hand side is precisely the dimension of Riemann-Roch space and I thought index of specialty has to be $0$ due to the specially chosen divisor $A$. This should give LHS=deg$(A)-g+1$ from my understanding but $g$ is not necessarily 1 (where $g$ is genus of $k$ over its constant field). It might be the case that we could make sure that $k$ is a finite $p$-extension of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}(T)$ but even so I don't see how this could change anything. For those who are interested what paper I am reading it's Class formation II by Kawada-Satake.","['number-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"
1673098,Continuity of cartesian product of functions between topological spaces,"I want to prove the following theorem: If $f:X\rightarrow X'$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Y'$ are continuous functions between topological spaces, then the mapping between product spaces $$f\times g:X\times Y\rightarrow X'\times Y', (x,y)\mapsto(f(x),g(y)) $$ is continuous. I am using the theorem written below: Theorem. Let $X, Y$ be topological spaces and $X\times Y$ their product space. If $Z$ is a topological space and $f:Z\rightarrow X\times Y$ a mapping, then $f$ is continuous iff $p\circ f, q\circ f$ are continous, where $p:X\times Y\rightarrow X, q:X\times Y\rightarrow Y$ are projections. Assume that $f:X\rightarrow X'$ and $g:Y\rightarrow Y'$ are continuous functions between topological spaces. Let $p':X'\times Y'\rightarrow X',q':X'\times Y'\rightarrow Y'$ be projections. Then let's assume that $p'\circ f\times g, q'\circ f\times g$ are continous. Let $W\subseteq X'\times Y'$ be open. Then there exists open sets $U_{i}\subseteq X'$ and $V_{i}\subseteq Y'$ $(i\in I)$ such that $U_i$ is open in $X'$ and $V_{i}$ is open in $Y'$ for every $i\in I$ and also $W=\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i\times V_i$ . Because $$(f\times g)^{-1}(W)=(f\times g)^{-1}\bigg(\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i\times V_i\bigg)=\bigcup_{i\in I}(f\times g)^{-1}(U_{i}\times V_{i}), $$ it's enough to show that $(f\times g)^{-1}(U_{i}\times V_{i})$ is open for every $i\in I$ . Now, $U_{i}\times V_{i} = (U_{i}\times Y')\cap (X'\times V_{i})=p'^{-1}(U_i)\cap q'^{-1}(V_i)$ . Then, $$\begin{align*}(f\times g)^{-1}(U_{i}\times V_{i})&=(f\times g)^{-1}(p'^{-1}(U_i)\cap q'^{-1}(V_i))\\
&=(p'\circ f\times g)^{-1}(U_{i})\cap(q'\circ f\times g)^{-1}(V_i).
\end{align*}$$ Now, there are also projections $p:X\times Y\rightarrow X, q:X\times Y\rightarrow Y$ . Because functions $f,g$ are continuous, then $f\circ p, g\circ q$ are continuous. And forward, because $f\times g\circ p' = f\circ p$ and $f\times g\circ q' = g\circ q$ we can continue $$(p'\circ f\times g)^{-1}(U_{i})\cap (q'\circ f\times g)^{-1}(V_i)=(f\circ p)^{-1}(U_i)\cap (g\circ q)^{-1}(V_{i})$$ which is open.

1673123,Is Gaussian integral the only one that can be easily solved by this double integral trick?,"For a lot of people the favorite way of solving Gaussian integral $I=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$ is to find $I^2$ in polar coordinates and then take a root. The trick may be useful in this case, but I struggle to find any other integral it can be applied to. The obvious condition for the integrated function is: $$f(x) \cdot f(y)=g(x^2+y^2)=h(|r|)$$ I don't know any other function aside from $e^{bx^2}$ that meets this condition. Moreover, the limits for the argument should be infinite. Otherwise we can't equate integration in the square $x,y \in (-a,a)$ with integration in the cirlce $r \in (0,a)$. But maybe this method can be generalized? For example, there may be some functions that give elementary integrals in polar form when multiplied $f(x)f(y)$ even if their product depends on the angle too?","['integration', 'definite-integrals']"

1673236,Is this property of continuous maps equivalent to properness?,"For the purposes of my question, a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is proper if it is closed and the preimage of every compact subspace of $Y$ is a compact subspace of $X$. Say a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ is semiproper if, for every continuous map $y : T \to Y$ where $T$ is compact, the space $T \times_Y X = \{ (t, x) \in T \times X : y (t) = f (x) \}$ is compact. It is a fact that a closed map is proper if and only if it is semiproper. Question. Are semiproper maps always closed? If $Y$ is a compactly generated Hausdorff space, then it is easy to check that every semiproper map $f : X \to Y$ is closed â€“ indeed, we only need the defining property for subspace inclusions $y : T \to Y$. On the other hand, if we weaken the definition by restricting to subspace inclusions $y : T \to Y$, then there are easy counterexamples. That leaves non-(compactly generated Hausdorff) spaces. Perhaps there is a counterexample there?","['general-topology', 'compactness', 'limits']"

1673427,"What makes a norm ""appropriate""? Why can't testfunctions be normed appropriately","I often hear the term ""using an appropriate norm"". Then I once read that the $C^\infty_0(\Omega)$ cannot be appropriately normed. Why is that?
Furthermore, when doing some numerical analysis you often use (Sobolev-)spaces which have various norms, why in these cases not use just the $L^2$-norm?
What makes a norm appropriate and why are often different norms necessary? Edit: I asked various questions which I believe have the same answer, hope this is ok. Edit2: For all who are interested, I want to give an answer to my own question, inspired by the comments below and some further thinking about the topic. To motivate the norms in Sobolev spaces: To make a Sobolev space a Banach space we need convergence of every Cauchy sequence to an element that also lies in $W^{k,p}$. We demand the elements of $W^{k,p}$ to have a weak derivative that lies in $L^p$ (actually multiple wead derivatives, depending on k). Assume we only used the $L^p$-norm to check for completeness, we would allow a sequence to converge to an element that only lies in $L^p$ but not in $W^{k,p}$. We would have a Cauchy sequence in $W^{k,p}$ that converges to an element in $L^p$ thus we would not have $W^{k,p}$ a Banach space (since it does not converge in the space). To avoid that we need a norm that only allows for sequences (to be Cauchy) that indeed converge to an element in $W^{k,p}$. 
The original $W^{k,p}$-norm allows for that because we need not only our function $f_n \rightarrow f$ in $L^p$ but also the respective weak derivatives. This is only due to the norm. Short: The norm tells us, what we need to look at when checking for completeness. And only an appropriate norm covers all demanded requirements for the space. So if we use the wrong norm we converge to an element that does not fulfill the requirements and therefore does not lie in the requested Sobolev space. So far the question, what the term appropriate means, this may have been crystal clear to the pros, to me it was not, I felt confused by the seemingly arbitrary choice of norms. This leads to the second question: Why cannot the test functions be normed appropriately? Exactly for that reason: whatever norm I chose I cannot make a sequence in $C^\infty_0$ converge to an element of this very space. 
How a topology does the job better is not exactly clear to me, but that is not what the initial question was about. 
Thanks to all people that helped me to shed some light on this.","['functional-analysis', 'normed-spaces', 'sobolev-spaces']"

1673497,Separable field extensions *without* using embeddings or automorphisms,"If $K\subseteq L$ is a field extension and $x\in L$ is algebraic, we say that $x$ is separable over $K$ iff its minimal polynomial $f$ over $K$ is separable (i.e., $f$Â is relatively prime with its derivative).  We say that $L$ is a separable algebraic extension iff every element of $L$ is separable algebraic. These definitions, of course, are quite standard.  Now what I'd like to find is a proof of such standard facts as ""if $x$ is algebraic separable overÂ $K$ then $K(x)$ is separable"" and ""if $L$ is algebraic separable over $K$ and $M$ is such over $L$ then $M$ is such overÂ $K$"", or a definition of the separable degree of an extension, all without using field automorphisms or the trick of counting embeddings in an algebraic closure. (There can be a number of reasons to want this: for pedagogical purposesout of a desire to postpone a discussion of Galois theory at a later point, or because embeddings/automorphisms are computationally or logically more complex objects than field extensions, or simply because it seems that the point of view in the first paragraph above should be more natural, or to compare different points of view.) Now every textbook I could find on field extensions uses at some point a comparison between the number of embeddings of $L$ in the algebraic closure of $K$ and the degree $[L:K]$.  But surely this can be avoided (we can, instead, work explicitly with roots of polynomials and perhaps elementary symmetric functions). So, does someone know a place where separable field extensions are introduced without counting embeddings or similar objects, staying as close as possible to the definition I gave above?

All are monoton, continous functions with $$\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x)=0$$ and $$\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=1.$$ There are numerous question on the site already, the most relevant is this: Does pointwise convergence against a continuous function imply uniform convergence? In the marked answer, there are two counterexamples, but I think both example series of functions converge to a $g(x)=\delta(x)$, which is not continous . Am I right? If yes, how the original statement could be proved? I am also aware of Dini's Theorem, but that applies only to function on closed intervals.","['real-analysis', 'probability-distributions', 'uniform-convergence', 'probability-theory']"

The fractional derivative in this scenario is given by: $$\frac{d^{1/2}}{dx^{1/2}}\ln(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{(-1)^{1/2}}{h^{1/2}}\sum_{0\le m<\infty}\frac{\Gamma(1.5)}{\Gamma(m+1)\Gamma(1.5-m+1)}\ln(x+mh)$$ It is rather difficult to take the limit from my skills, so I was hoping someone could solve it.

It is about the implementation of law of cosines to sum of vectors. I know how it works with triangles. I get the logic about the interaction between the two edges and the angle between them. But there is something I don't understand about choosing which angle we should use for the formula. In the following visual: Orange vector's magnitude is $2$ and angle is $0^\circ$. Green vector's magnitude is $2$ and angle is $45^\circ$. Grey is sum. Blue is X line. Red is Y line. Now angle $\angle B = 45^\circ$ and therefore $\angle A = 135^\circ$. If we consider the shape as a triangle, then in order to find the grey line, we must implement the law of cosines with $\cos 135^\circ$. Like this: $$V_\text{grey}=\sqrt{{V_\text{orange}}^2 + {V_\text{green}}^2 - 2V_\text{orange}\cdot V_\text{green}\cos 135^\circ}$$ However, on the tutorial I have seen on the internet, when calculating the sum of vector forces, they use $\cos 45^\circ$ in the formula instead, saying we must use the angle between the vectors (in the tutorial they both originate from the $(0,0)$ point). But then, when generating the shape geometrically, we technically don't use the angle that is facing the edge we want to find the value of.

By definition, $X$ is a separated prevariety, and $x \in X$.  I'm trying to show (i): The minimal primes of $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ are in bijection with the irreducible components of $X$ containing $x$. Since $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ is reduced, this shows in particular that (ii): $\mathcal O_{X,x}$ is an integral domain if and only if $x$ lies in only one irreducible component. The affine case is pretty easy.  Here $X = \textrm{Max } A$ for some reduced finitely generated $K$-algebra $A$.  If $m \in X$, the stalk $\mathcal O_{X,m}$ is canonically isomorphic to $A_m$, and prime ideals here are in bijection with primes $P$ of $A$ contained in $m$, i.e. primes $P$ for which $m \in V(P) = \{ \mathfrak m \in X : P \subseteq \mathfrak m\}$.  Primes $P$ correspond to irreducible closed sets $V(P)$, with minimal primes corresponding to irreducible components, done. This is apparently supposed to generalize to the nonaffine case, but I'm just not seeing it.  If $X_1, ... , X_s$ are all the irreducible components of $X$, and $x$ lies only in $X_1, ... , X_t$, and if I pick an affine open set $U$ containing $x$, then a subset of $X_1 \cap U, ... , X_s \cap U$ are the irreducible components of $U$, and a subset of $X_1 \cap U, ... , X_t \cap U$ are the components containing $x$.

Taking the second derivative $\ f\prime\prime(x)= \frac{-1}{4x^\frac{3}{2}}$ and using the second derivative test at the point $x =\frac{1}{4}$ shows the second derivative is negative, indicating a maximum.

(3) I think I need to apply the Lagrange Multiplier Theorem (see page 113) in multi-variable calculus, but we need to make sure that the rank of the Jacobian matrix of $ \Phi $ is of rank $ k $ at the point $ p $ . However, there arenâ€™t any extra conditions on $ \Phi $ . You can either answer my questions separately or show me a detailed proof of it.

1675006,Sum and difference formula for $\tan$ - I keep getting positive instead of negative answer,"Sorry if this question is long/repetitive. I'm trying to list every single step to see where I've messed up. The question is to find $\tan(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{3})$. Using a calculator, I get $-3.72$ or $-2 -\sqrt{3}$. This will be used to check my answer. I know that the sum and difference formula for $\tan$ is: $$\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) = \frac{\tan(\alpha) \pm \tan(\beta)}{1 \mp \tan(\alpha) \tan(\beta)}$$ Plugging the values in, I get: $$\tan(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \tan(\frac{\pi}{3})}{1 - \tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) \tan(\frac{\pi}{3})}$$ $$\frac{1 + \sqrt3}{1 - (1)(\sqrt3)}$$ $$\frac{1 + \sqrt3}{1 - \sqrt3}$$ Now in order to rationalize this, I must multiply by the conjugate of $\sqrt3 - 1$: $$\frac{(\sqrt3 + 1)(\sqrt3 + 1)}{(\sqrt3 - 1)(\sqrt3 + 1)}$$ The formulas for easy FOIL is: $$(x + a)(x + a) = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$$
$$(x + a)(x - a) = x^2 - a^2$$ Resulting in: $$\frac{3 + 2\sqrt3 + 1}{3 - 1}$$
$$\frac{4 + 2\sqrt3}{2}$$
$$2 + \sqrt3$$ As you can see, the answer is correct, but the signs are incorrect. Where did I screw up?",['trigonometry']
1675010,Why does $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \cos^n(n)$ converges?,"Consider the series $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\cos^n(n)$$ I think that the root test is inconclusive, because $$\limsup_n \sqrt[n]{|\cos^n(n)|}=\limsup_n|\cos(n)|\leq 1$$ once we can approximate $\pi$ by rational numbers, there will always be some $i$ and $j\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $|j\pi-i|<\varepsilon$, for every $\varepsilon>0$ that we choose. And in this case $|\cos(i)-1|<\delta$. Nevertheless, it seems that it converges . I can't think of any other convergent series to compare with it. My question is: how can I prove that this series converges? Edit : Actually, this series diverges, as you can see in tmyklebu's answer. I made a fortran program  and here are some values of the sequence of the partial sums: n     S_n

1675021,Why is the trivial vector space the smallest vector space?,"My book (Elementary Linear Algebra by Andrilli) says: The set $\mathcal{{V}}$ = {${\mathbb {0}}$} is a vector space AND is

1675074,Torus-cylinder intersection.,"The standard equation for a torus rotated about the $z$ axis is:
$$(x^2+y^2+z^2+R^2-r^2)^2 = 4R^2 (x^2+y^2)$$ The cylinder of interest is parallel to the $x$ axis and offset along the $y$ axis by $R$: $$z^2 +(y-R)^2=r^2$$ I'm trying to evaluate some function $H(x,y,z)$ over the surface created by the intersection of a torus and a cylinder as in https://i.sstatic.net/MxOLT.png . I'm aware that a solution exists ( https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/5968/plotting-implicitly-defined-space-curves ), but I can't find a solution where the result is actually written fully. From the intersection curve, I'm planning to find the ''shadow region'' $D$. I'd like to evaluate the integral using the following standard surface integral method, $$\int \int_S H(x,y,z) d \sigma = \int \int_D H(x,y,z) \frac{|{\nabla F}|}{|\nabla F\cdot p|} dA$$ I cannot manage to find intersection curve. My first three attempts just hung in both Maple and Matlab when trying to evaluate the integral.","['integration', 'geometry']"
1675086,Find the probability distribution of the random variable X.,"A fair coin is flipped $3$ times. Consider a random variable $X$ which is the number of runs. Number of runs is the number of changes of letter $H$ and $T$. For example, $HHH$ has one run, $TTH$ has two runs and $THT$ has three runs. Find the probability distribution of the random variable $X$. My work: I don't understand the phrasing of this question. In examples in my textbook and online $X$ is defined as the number of heads or tails. But I can't follow where the example in this question is going. I would think that $TTH$ and $THT$ would both have 2 runs since $HHH$ only has one. I don't know what zero runs would be either. Can anyone give me guidance on what exactly this question means? I'm pretty sure I can solve it once I understand what the number of runs means. The outcomes would be: $HHH$ $X=1$ $HTH$ $HHT$ $THH$ $TTH$ $X=2$ $HTT$ $THT$ $X=3$ $TTT$ I don't know what number of $X$ would correspond with each.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'statistics']"

1675128,Example of a partially ordered set whose Hasse diagram would look like a full binary tree,"I am starting to study partially ordered sets and I was curious as to if there is an example of a poset whose Hasse diagram would look like a full-binary tree. A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children Also, are there any infinite posets which would have the form of a full binary tree? Would Zorn's Lemma apply to such a poset? Thanks","['graph-theory', 'elementary-set-theory']"
