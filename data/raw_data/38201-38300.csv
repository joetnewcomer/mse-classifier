372406,Analysis without algebra,"I once heard someone say that analysis is $99 \%$ algebra. He was, of course, referring to the amount of algebraic manipulations in the exercises from any calculus course. I know that in topology, combinatorics or, oddly, (abstract) algebra, some interesting things can be said without writing down a single equation. However I found that I don't know any such examples in analysis. Hence I ask for your help. Anything resembling analysis is welcome, but I'd prefer if the example was comprehensible to someone who has taken only a year or two of real analysis.","['algebra-precalculus', 'examples-counterexamples', 'soft-question', 'analysis']"
372409,Ordered statistics: find $E(Y(i) Y(j))$,"Let $Y1 ,…., Yn$ be independent, uniformly distributed random variables on the interval [0,1]. Find: $Var[Y_{(j)}- Y_{(i)}]$, the variance of the difference between two ordered statistics 
Where i and j are integers with 1≤i < j ≤n. My Steps are:
1) find the joint density function. My answer:
$$\frac{n!}{(i-1)!(j-i-1)!(n-j)!}(y_{(i)})^{i-1}(y_{(j)}-y_{(i)})^{j-1-i}(1-y_{(j)})^{n-j}$$ where $0< y_{(i)}< y_{(j)}<1$ 2) Find $E[Y_{(i)}Y_{(j)}]$ from first principle
$$a\int_{0}^{1}\int_{y(_{j})}^{1}y_{(j)}(y_{(j)}-y_{(i)})^{(j-i-1)}(1-y_{(j)})^{n-j}y_{i}^{i} dy_{(i)}dy_{(j)}$$ where $$a = \frac{n!}{(i-1)!(j-i-1)!(n-j)!}$$
This is where I am stuck. I am not sure how to integrate this integrand. Any tips/hints would be great. My aim is to convert this to a Beta form. 3)  Find $\operatorname{Cov}[Y_{(i)}, Y_{(j)}]$ using $\operatorname{Cov}[Y_{(i)},Y_{(j)}] = E[Y_{(i)}Y_{(j)}] - E[Y_{(i)}]E[Y_{(j)}]$. But this depends on step 2. 4)  Find the variance using the generic $\operatorname{Var}[A-B]=\operatorname{Var}[A]+\operatorname{Var}[B]-2\operatorname{Cov}[A,B]$ . However, this all depends on part 3 and the steps before it. Please provide some guidance as to whether my overall approach is correct and what can I do to overcome step 2. Thanks. Edit: sorry for step 2 -> it should be $E[Y_{(i)}Y_{(j)}]$ not $E[Y_{(i)}-Y_{(j)}]$. Typing error.","['statistics', 'order-statistics']"

372455,A non-abelian group of order $ 6 $ is isomorphic to $ S_3 $,"I know that it is duplicated. But I'm confusing some step of this proof. Please help me. pf) Let $ G $ be a nontrivial group of order $ 6 $. Since $ G $ is non-abelian, no elements in $ G $ have the order $ 6 $. Assume that every element except $ e $ is of order 2. If $ x $ and $ y $ are of order $ 2 $ and not equal. Then $ \langle x, y \rangle $ has the order $ 4 $. It is contradiction, since $ 4 $ does not divide the order of $ G $. So, $ G $ must contain an element of order $ 3 $, say $ y $. Let $ \langle y \rangle$ and $x \langle y \rangle$ be two cosets. Consider $ yx $. Since $ x\notin\langle y \rangle$ and $ y\neq x$, $yx = xy$ or $yx=xy^2$ . In the case of $yx = xy$, consider the order of $ xy$. If the order of $ xy$ is $2$, then $y=x^2$. And so the order of $ x $ is $ 6 $ . Then it tis contradiction. (I don't understand why it consider only when the order of $ xy $ is $ 2$ .) Hence $yx=xy^2$. Moreover, since $ x^2 \in x \langle y \rangle$ , $ x^2 \in \langle y \rangle$ . (This is another confusing part. Why $ x^2$ need to be in $  x \langle y \rangle$? And even if it is true, why it means $ x^2 \in \langle y \rangle$? ) Since $ x \neq y, y^2 $, $ x = e $. Hence $ G $ is isomorphic to $ S_3 $.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
372465,"How to prove that $(u-v)^+\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, if $u\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, $v\geq 0$.","Let $\Omega$ denote a open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ the Sobolev space of weakly differentiable functions $u\in L^p(\Omega)$ (that is, for which $D_iu$ exists and belongs to $L^p(\Omega)$ as well, for every $i\in\left\{1,\ldots,n\right\}$). I'm studying boundary regularity of a solution of the Dirichlet problem for the circle $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$, and the weak maximum principle is needed. For that, we need to give a proper meaning for $u\leq v$ in $\partial\Omega$ (the boundary of $\Omega$), where $u,v\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$. The definition is:
$u\leq v$ in $\partial\Omega$ iff $(u-v)^+\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, where: $w^+=\max(w,0)$ denotes the positive part of $w$; and $W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$ is the closure (in Sobolev norm) of $C_0^\infty(\Omega)=\left\{w\in C^\infty(\Omega):\text{supp}(w)\text{ is compact}\right\}$ Now, a lot of statements relating to that concept need the following lemma (or something similar), which I'm unable to prove: Lemma : Let $u\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, $v\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ such that $v\geq 0$ pointwise. Show that $(u-v)^+\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$. Intuitively, that should be true. If we think of continuous functions $u$ and $v$ such that $u\in C_0(\Omega)$, then $(u-v)^+\in C_0(\Omega)$, since $|(u-v)^+|\leq|u|$ (where $C_0(\Omega)$ denotes the set o compactly supported continuous functions from $\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$). Using mollifiers, it's easy to see that $C_0(\Omega)\subseteq W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)$, and the lemma is true in that case. I tried to give the following proof: The case $u\in C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ is easy enough. Now, let $\left\{u_n\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq C_0^\infty(\Omega)$ be a sequence converging in $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ to $u$. Taking subsequences if necessary, I tried making pointwise convergence (almost everywhere in $\Omega$) of $(u_n-v)^+$ and $D_i(u_n-v)^+$ to $(u-v)^+$ and $D_i(u-v)^+$, respectively, so I'd apply Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem, and conclude convergence in $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$, hence proving the lemma. The problem is exactly with the derivatives:
Since $Dw^+(x)=0$ if $w(x)\leq 0$ and $Dw^+(x)=Dw(x)$ if $w(x)>0$ ($\forall w\in W^{1,2}(\Omega)$: this follows from the weak chain rule), we cannot garantee pointwise convergence if $u(x)=v(x)$. Any idea would be of great value. Even if one must assume $\Omega$ bounded and/or $v\in C^\infty(\Omega)\cap C^0(\overline{\Omega})$, it would suffice for what I need.

372603,"Given a functor between categories, how to denote a morphism between particular objects of that category","I have a very common situation, for which I need both: (1) notation; and, if available, (2) a general relative term.  Let's say that: there is a functor between categories, $f:C_1\to C_2$, $c_1$ is a particular object of $C_1$ $c_2$ is a particular object of $C_2$, such that in mapping $C_1$ to $C_2$, $f$ maps $c_1$ to $c_2$ What is the name given to a morphism that maps $c_1$ to $c_2$ in the same way that $f$ does, independently of the existence of $C_1$ or $C_2$?  What concise notation can I use to refer to such a morphism? I am sure that there is a clear answer for this, but so that the point of my confusion is more clear, these are my intuitions about the issue: $f$ itself can't be the answer, because it is a specialization of the morphism that I am referring to, because it communicates a lot more information than just $c_1\to c_2$.  For example, it is possible that another functor could map two completely different categories and still meet the criteria of mapping $c_1$ to $c_2$. (e.g. if $g: C_3 \to C_4$ could map $c_1$ to $c_2$ despite being distinct from $C_1$ and $C_2$) $f(c_1)$ seems closer to what I am looking for, but I think that $f(c_1)$ should actually refer to the resultant value, or $c_2$ itself.  I am interested in the morphism between $c_1$ and $c_2$, rather than only $c_2$. Update: If my question seems nonsensical for reasons raised by both @Jim and @AlexKruckman, let's just consider $c_1$ and $c_2$ to be categories themselves and the morphism I am asking about to also be a functor itself.","['abstract-algebra', 'category-theory', 'functions']"

372801,What role does differentiability play in Topology?,"My question is stated in the title. As a brief background, I'd like to say I know next to nothing about Topology. The little bit I was exposed to came as an aside in my Multivariate Calculus class; we were discussing which boundary-less surfaces may we apply Stokes' Theorem to and conclude that the  $\int_\Sigma (\nabla\times \vec{F})\cdot d\vec{S}=0.$ We mentioned that any surface that is ""topologically equivalent"" to a sphere, torus, ""torus with two holes"", etc., fits the bill (i.e., we classified by ""genus"", or number of holes). We further said that each of these surfaces (with different number of holes) is ""topologically different"" because one would need to ""rip"" or ""tear"" the surface to get another, but in this ""game"" we only allow ""stretching"" or ""twisting"" as the means of deformation. I've also heard, in passing, the terms ""smooth"" and ""differentiable"" applied in the context of Topology. My question is how that comes into Topology. If, as according to my very limited understanding, Topology is the study of ""deforming"" figures according to certain rules, how does differentiability enter the picture? Furthermore, aren't we considering all figures, i.e., even figures that go beyond the notion of a ""function"" and would not necessarily be able to be differentiated? Perhaps since my knowledge is so vague on the topic, I'm missing an obvious fact. Anyways, thanks in advance.","['general-topology', 'differential-topology']"

This means, I have to choose $\psi$ such that it satisfies these two conditions: a) $\psi(X)$ is $\sigma(Y)$ -measurable. b) $\mathbb{E}[X1_B]=\mathbb{E}[\psi(X)1_B]$ ,
i.e. $\int_{B} X d\mathbb{P}=\int_{B} \psi(X) d\mathbb{P}$ for each $B \in \mathfrak{B}$ . The density property of $f$ means $\mathbb{P}(X\in A)=\int_{A}f d\lambda=\int_{X^{-1}(A)}1 d\mathbb{P}$ for each $A\in \mathfrak{B}$ . But how does it relate to these conditions a) and b)?

Explicitly, if $N$ is odd, there is exactly one fixed point, and if $J$ is even, there are none. A permutation with these properties establishes a pairing between the integers from 1 to $N$, where $i$ is paired with $J(i)$ (except if $N$ is odd, in which case the fixed point is not paired). Therefore we will call $J$ a pairing .

373014,Approximating a Hilbert-Schmidt operator,"Let $H$ be a separable Hilbert space.  Recall that a bounded operator $A : H \to H$ is said to be Hilbert-Schmidt if $$\|A\|_{HS}^2 := \sum_{i=1}^\infty \|A e_i\|^2 < \infty$$
where $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is an orthonormal basis for $H$.  (The value of $\|A\|_{HS}$ does not depend on the basis chosen.) Suppose that $A$ is Hilbert-Schmidt, and let $\{P_n\}$ be a sequence of finite-rank orthogonal projection operators on $H$, such that $P_n \to I$ strongly (i.e. $P_n x \to x$ for every $x \in H$).  Does $P_n A P_n \to A$ in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm $\|\cdot\|_{HS}$? I can prove this under the additional assumption that $\{P_n\}$ is increasing, i.e. $P_n H \subset P_{n+1} H$.  In this case, we may choose an orthonormal basis $\{e_i\}$ for $H$ such that for each $n$, $e_1, \dots, e_{d_n}$ is an orthonormal basis for $P_n H$, where $d_n$ is the rank of $P_n$.  Then $P_n e_i$ = $e_i$ for $i \le d_n$, and $P_n e_i = 0$ otherwise, so we can write
$$\|P_n A P_n - A\|_{HS}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{d_n} \|(P_n - I) A e_i\|^2 + \sum_{i=d_n+1}^\infty \|A e_i\|^2.$$
As $n \to \infty$, $d_n \to \infty$, and the second term goes to 0 because it is the tail of the convergent series $\sum \|A e_i\|^2 = \|A\|_{HS}^2$.  For the first term, we have $$\|(P_n - I) A e_i\| \le \|P_n - I\| \|A e_i\| \le 2 \|A e_i\|$$
which is a square-summable sequence because $A$ is Hilbert-Schmidt.  And for each $i$ we have $\|(P_n - I) A e_i\| \to 0$ since $P_n \to I$ strongly.  So by the dominated convergence theorem, we conclude the first term also goes to 0. However, without this assumption, $P_n e_i$ is harder to deal with, and I don't see how to craft a proof (nor a counterexample). If it helps, I'm most interested in the case where $A$ is skew-adjoint, i.e. $A^* = -A$. I'd also be interested to know if this statement still holds if we drop the assumption that $P_n$ are orthogonal projections, and only assume that they are finite rank and converge strongly to $I$.

It's likely that general aspects of the solution are enough to answer my question, so I don't have to force anyone to go into the gory details. My mathematical education also stopped somewhere around intermediate-level calculus, so go easy on me please! I am interested in percolation pathways between two parallel flat sheets, separated by a certain distance $d$ in empty 3D space. Imagine one were to start adding small non-intersecting flat planes of area $A$ (with largest ""diameter"" $\ll d$) in the empty space, with rotational freedom in any axis. Would there be a difference in the ""speed"" at which the distance would be percolated, if the size of the added planes were varied (though always smaller than the distance between the limiting parallel sheets)? For example, considering adding planes of a constant shape (such as squares of differing sizes), what would the relation between the average ""occupation density"" for a successful percolation to happen be, if we were to compare adding squares of area $A$ with squares of area $A/10$? Equivalently (or at least I think it is), if we were to compare adding $x$ square planes of area $A$, and $10x$ square planes of area $A/10$, in which case would the probability of percolating the distance $d$ be higher? My gut feeling is that using a lower amount of larger planes makes it easier to percolate than a higher amount of smaller planes. A detailed analysis of the problem in its full form is likely infeasible, so I assume that relaxed constraints are required, such as adding square planes to a 3D cubic grid. Is this approximation of the problem sufficient to provide reliable answers that can be transferred to the general version (i.e. adding arbitrary 1D/2D/3D shapes, arbitrary placement, arbitrary shape sizes, including largest ""diameters"" $\simeq d$ or even $>d$ )?

Prove that if $S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S$ then $R \circ S$ is transitive. First, I'm wondering if my proof is correct? Second, I'm really curious as to if there are any more elegant ways of proving this statement? It took me a long time of playing around with different possibilities to find this argument. Are there any shortcuts I am missing, or any related theorems about relations that people find are helpful when trying to prove statements like the one above? Here is my proof: Suppose $S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S$. Let $x,y,z \in A$. Suppose $(x,y) \in R \circ S$ and $(y,z) \in R \circ S$. Since $(x,y) \in R \circ S$, we can choose some $a \in A$ such that $(x,a) \in S$ and $(a,y) \in R$. Similarly, since $(y,z) \in R \circ S$, we can choose some $b \in B$ such that $(y,b) \in S$ and $(b,z) \in R$. We have $(a,y) \in R$ and $(y,b) \in S$, so $(a,b) \in S \circ R$. Since $S \circ R \subseteq R \circ S$, $(a,b) \in R \circ S$, so we can choose some $c \in A$ such that $(a,c) \in S$ and $(c,b) \in R$. We have $(x,a) \in S$ and $(a,c) \in S$, so since $S$ is transitive, $(x,c) \in S$. We also have $(c,b) \in R$ and $(b,z) \in R$, so since $R$ is transitive, $(c,z) \in R$. Hence, $(x,c) \in S$ and $(c,z) \in R$, so $(x,z) \in R \circ S$.","['relations', 'proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'function-and-relation-composition']"

(b) If $\{ \mathfrak{a}_i\}$ is any family of homogeneous ideals of $S$ , then $V\left(\sum\mathfrak{a}_i\right)=\cap V(\mathfrak{a}_i)$ .

373279,Groups acting on polytopes,"I am currently reading the paper ""Polytopal Resolutions for Finite Groups"" [1] by Graham Ellis, James Harris and Emil Skoeldberg and have a question regarding an early remark of theirs. Their basic setup is as follows: They take a finite group $G$ acting faithfully, linearly and orthogonally on Euclidean space ($E=\mathbb{R}^n$) and a vector $v \in E$ such that $gv \neq v$ holds for all $g \neq 1$ in $G$. Then they consider the convex hull $P(G,v)$ of $Gv$ which is obviously a polytope (since $G$ is finite) and therefore a natural CW-Complex. The group acts on $P(G,v)$ by permuting faces in each dimension and we can conclude that the cellular chain complex $C_*(P)$ is in fact a complex of $\mathbb{Z}G$-modules (I am actually somewhat unclear on the definition of the corresponding differential but luckily there are algorithms that can compute it if necessary). My problem starts when they describe the action on $C_k(P)$: The module $C_k(P)$ is $\mathbb{Z}$-free (not necessarily $\mathbb{Z}G$-free) with free generators which can be identified with the $k$-faces of $P(G)$ and $G$-action $ge=\pm f$ if $g$ maps the $k$-face $e$ to $f$ with sign depending on the orientation with which $g$ maps $e$ to $f$. I am quite unsure about the meaning of this. If I have a $1$- or a $2$-face I can give it an orientation in a somewhat natural way but what is the orientation of some $5$-face of a polytope in dimension $8$ (e.g.). Even if there was a way to give each $k$-face an orientation wouldn`t the choice be kind of arbitrary? What confuses me most is the implementation: In the HAP-package for the computer algebra system Gap there is an algorithm which computes $C_*(P)$ for given $G$ and $v$. Among other things a function ""action($k,j,g$)"" is computed with output $\pm1$ depending on how the element $g$ acts on the permutation on the cell ""j"" in dimension $k$. However if you have a look at the code you can see that the output does not depend on $k$ and $j$ at all but merely on the property of $g$ to belong to the subgroup $G_{ev}$ which is generated by all products of two generators of $G$ (the generating set for $G$ being computed via a Gap-command). This is not even invariant under the choice of the generating system. Why should the action on the orientation only depend on this choice of a generating system? Thanks in advance for any help.

373283,A question on an answer on Math Overflow about Artin approximation,"I have a question on an answer of this Math Overflow question . Let $(A,I)$ be a commutative excellent normal local domain. The completion
$$
\hat A=\underset{\longleftarrow}{\operatorname{lim}} A/(I^nA)

has $A$ as a subring by the canonical map. An answer to the referred question on MO states that the henselization $A^h$ of $A$ can be defined as the separable closure $S$ of $A$ in $\hat A$. More precisely, an element $a\in \hat A$ is in $A^h$ iff there if a separable polynomial $f\in A[X]$ with $f(a)=0$ (is this interpretation correct?). According to the answers, this should follow from Artin approximation. How does this description of $A^h$ follows from Artin approximation? Where do I need the properties ''excellent'' and ''normal''? Where ''separability''? At least for the (probably easy?) direction $S\subseteq A^h$ there should be an other argument. To cite a lecture of Popescu, a Noetherian local ring $(A,I)$ has the property of approximation if
  every finite system of polynomial equations $f$ over $A$ in
  $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ has its solutions in $A$ dense with respect to the
  $I$-adic topology in the set of its solutions in the completion $\hat A$
  of $A$; that is, for every solution $\hat x$ of $f$ in $\hat A$ and
  every positive integer $c$ there exists a solution $x$ of $f$ in $A$
  such that $$x\equiv \hat x\mod I^c\hat A.$$ The Artin approximation theorem is the statement that some rings have this property of approximation. This should be relevant for the question with a single polynomial equation instead of a system. I think one needs ''normality'' and ''excellence'' for the Artin approximation theorem to hold but I can't find it in the literature formulated with these properties. Moreover, I am curious where the separability comes into the game.","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

373315,"Ring of Regular functions on $\Bbb{A}^2 - \{(0,0)\}$","Suppose I want to determine the ring of regular functions on  $U = \Bbb{A}^2 - \{(0,0)\}$. Now I can do this assuming the following fact: Fact: If $f$ is regular on $U$, then we can write $f = g/h$ with $g,h$ polynomials in $k[x,y]$ such that $h(p) \neq 0$ on all of $U$. How does this come from the definition of $f$ being regular on $U$? The definition (at least the one given in Hartshorne 1.3 ) is: Definition: Let $Y$ be an open subset of an affine variety. A function $f : Y \to k$ is regular at $P \in Y$ if there is an open neighbourhood $V$ with $P \in V \subseteq Y$ and polynomials  $g,h \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $h$ is non-zero on $U$ and $f = g/h$ on $V$. We say $f$ is regular on $Y$ if it is regular at every point in $Y$. Now I am a little confused as to how the fact I claim comes from this definition. In my mind, I have the following hazy interpretation. My thoughts: Suppose we pick any open subset $W \subseteq U = \Bbb{A}^2 - \{(0,0)\}$. Then I can write $f = g/h$ for some polynomials $g,h$ at least on $W$ . I claim that that actually $f = g/h$ on the whole of $U$ . Indeed, pick any other non-empty open subset $W' \subseteq U$ and suppose $f = g'/h'$ on $W'$. Then because $W,W'$ are two dense open subsets they have a non-empty intersection, so that when we restrict to $W \cap W'$, 
    $$ \frac{g}{h}= f|_{W \cap W'}  = \frac{g'}{h'}.$$
    Thus $g/h $ and $g'/h'$ agree on a dense open subset and thus are equal on all of $U$. So it makes sense to set $f = g/h$ on all of $U$. I think my understanding is correct, but I'm interested in different ways of understanding the fact I quote above.",['algebraic-geometry']

I'm just having a lot of trouble seeing how to tie it into the proof. I apologize for not being able to condense the subsequent ramblings into a shorter notation, I'm still a bit shaky with LaTeX.  So far I have attempted using the following facts in the proof: $X$ being second-countable implies that $X$ has a countable dense subset, hence separable, so there must be some sequence which has an element in every open subset of $X$; $X$ being second-countable implies that there exists some collection of open subsets of $X$ such that any open subset of $X$ can be expressed as the union of some subfamily of the aforementioned collection of open subsets; $X$ being second-countable implies that every open cover of $X$ has a countable subcover (Lindelof); $X$ is KC (every compact subset of $X$ is closed); the basic ways to show that $X$ is Hausdorff (for each pair of points there exists disjoint neighborhoods, diagonal is closed, every singleton is equal to the intersection of all closed neighborhoods of that singleton, etc).

373401,Self-studying real analysis — Tao or Rudin?,"The reference requests for analysis books have become so numerous as to blot out any usefulness they could conceivably have had. So here comes another one. Recently I've began to learn real analysis via Rudin. I would do all the exercises, and if I was unable to do them within a time limit (usually about 30 min) I would look the answers up. Combined with the excellent online lectures by Francis Su, I made rapid progress. Encouraged I now intend to self-study analysis II and function theory.
However apart from its uninformative and dry style, Rudin's does not cover everything I intend to study. After searching for a suitable textbook, I was particularly attracted to Analysis I&II by Terry Tao. His breadth of knowledge and his nack for clear exposition are famous but I particularly like that he starts from the very beginning and builds it up from there, as well as putting real analysis inside a greater unified whole. His books would cover exactly what I intend to study. For instance, he covers fourier series, which Rudin's doesn't. However after searching for hours I've been unable to find any solutions sets. (apart from a few on the earliest chapters). It is my experience that is almost impossible to self-study a subject thoroughly without solutions or constant feedback, even with an outstanding textbook. 
 Which leaves me with few options: Proceed with Rudin's, perhaps with some supplementary book. Try to work with Terry Tao's Analysis I&II without solutions. Find a different book altogether that is both comprehensive and readable as well as having at least a partial solution set. I know a lot of people will recommend Rudin but I have to doubt their experience with self-study: yes it is possible to learn directly from Rudin but it's painful and slow. And quite frankly I feel that a lot of people have poured a lot of time and effort in Rudin and feel that more than teach them analysis it has brought them mathematical maturity. That is all well and good but it's not what I'm interested in. Another idea would be to get both and read Tao, while doing the exercises in Rudin's. I don't think that would be a good idea however, a lot of theorems in Tao are left to the reader and the pace and coverage of both books are very different. In general I dislike getting more than one book.

Is that possible?",['functions']
373498,Complex Integral using Residues theorem: $\int_0^{2\pi}{d\theta \over1+8\cos^2\theta} $,"This is the question: Find the integral using residue theorem. $$\int_0^{2\pi}{d\theta \over1+8\cos^2\theta} $$ I solved it like this : $$\int_0^{2\pi}{d\theta \over1+8\cos^2\theta}=\int_0^{2 \pi} {d\phi \over 5+4\cos\phi} $$ using $$2\cos^2\theta=\cos 2\theta+1 \quad\quad and \quad 2\theta=\phi$$ Then i took $z=e^{i\phi}$ , so th integral now becomes : $$\int_C {1 \over (2z^2+5z+2)} {dz \over iz} \quad c:|z|=1$$ Now using the residue theorem on the obtained poles i get answer as $$4\pi \over 3$$ Can someone please verify it","['definite-integrals', 'residue-calculus', 'integration', 'complex-analysis']"
373501,Inverse images under universally injective morphisms,"Let Y be locally Noetherian, and consider a projective morphism $f:X \rightarrow Y$ such that the map $\textbf{Spec} f_\ast \mathcal{O}_X \rightarrow Y $ is universally injective. Let $C \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes with $C$ connected. How could I show that $X \times_Y C$ is connected? So  far, I have been trying to show that the ring of global sections in the fiber product doesn't have any non-trivial idempotents by using that C doesn't have any. I have also noted that the map from the fiber product to C is projective, but no luck there. Thankful,

373504,"Field of fractions of $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\langle x^2+y^2-1\rangle$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\langle x^2+y^2-1 \rangle$ is an integral domain, and its field of fractions is isomorphic to $\mathbb Q(t)$ [closed] (3 answers) Closed 11 years ago . This problem goes as follows: Prove that $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/\langle x^2+y^2-1\rangle$ is an integral domain and that its field of fractions is isomorphic to the ring of rational functions $\mathbb{Q}(t)$. The first part is straightforward, $x^2+y^2-1$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x,y]$, and  hence a prime ideal, as $\mathbb[Q][x,y]$ is a euclidean and hence a UFD. The quotient by a prime ideal is an integral domain. How do I do the second part? I guess, I have to set a isomorphism by making a substitution such that only one variable remains. But I don't see how $x^2+y^2-1$ is going to help me make a choice.","['commutative-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
