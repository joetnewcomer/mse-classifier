52776,Carathéodory's method gives a complete measure,"I would really like to show that the following is true. ""Suppose that $X$ is a set and $\theta$ is an outer measure on $X$, and let $\mu$ be the measure on $X$ defined by Carathéodory's method. Then if $\theta E = 0$, then $\mu$ measures $E$."" I'm not exactly sure how $E$ is defined, which could be the problem, but the question goes onto ask me to deduce that if $E \subseteq X$ is $\mu$-negligible iff $\theta E = 0$, so I assume that this is the same $E$ as in the statement above. I have been using the following definitions and theorems. Definition (sigma algebra) Let $X$ be a set. A *$\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$ is a family $\Sigma$ of subsets of $X$ such that (i) $\emptyset \in \Sigma$; (ii) for every sequence $\left< E_n \right>_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\Sigma$, its union $\bigcup _{n \in \mathbb{N}} E_n$ belongs to $\Sigma$. Definition (measure space) A measure space is a triple $(X, \Sigma, \mu)$ where (i) $X$ is a set; (ii) $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of X; (iii) $\mu : \Sigma \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ is a function such that (a) $\mu \emptyset = 0 $; (b) if $\left<E_n \right>_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a disjoint sequence in $\Sigma$, then $\mu \left( \bigcup _{n \in \mathbb{N} } E_n \right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu E_n$. In this context, members of $\Sigma$ are called measurable sets, and $\mu$ is called a measure on $X$ . Definition (outer measure) Let $X$ be a set. An outer measure on $X$ is a function $\theta : \mathcal{P}X \rightarrow \left[ 0 , \infty \right]$ such that (i) $\theta \emptyset = 0$, (ii) if $A \subseteq B \subseteq X$ then $\theta A \leq \theta B$, (iii) for every sequence $\left< A_n \right> _{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of subsets of $X$, $\theta \left( \bigcup _{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n \right) \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \theta A_n$. Carothéodory's Method: Theorem Let X be a set and $\theta$ an outer measure on $X$. Set $$
\Sigma := \left\{ E \subseteq X : \theta A = \theta \left(A \cap E \right) + \theta \left( A \setminus E \right), \forall  A \subseteq X \right\}.
$$ Then $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$ algebra of subsets of $X$. Define $\mu : \Sigma \rightarrow \left[0, \infty \right]$ by writing $\mu E = \theta E$ for $E \in \Sigma$; then $\left( X, \Sigma, \mu \right)$ is a measure space. I think I've followed the proof I have for the above Carothéodory's Method, and I suspect that the proof of the statement in question shall follow it, but proving instead that $\left(A, \Sigma, \mu \right)$ is a measure space. Perhaps the proof is trivial? I just can't see it.","['measure-theory', 'analysis']"

A cubical sphere is a cubical complex that is homeomorphic to a sphere.

but I do not understand the distinction.  Is there a distinction already in $\mathbb{R}^3$?

52786,Orthogonal planes in n-dimensions,"In 3D two planes are orthogonal when their normal vectors are orthogonal (their inner product is zero). For example, planes $xy$ and $xz$ are orthogonal because their normal vectors $\hat{z}$ and $\hat{y}$ respectively are orthogonal, i.e $\hat{z}\cdot \hat{y}=0$ . How we define orthogonality of planes in $n$ dimensions? I am talking about 2d planes through the origin, in n-dimensional Euclidean space, that are specified by orthonormal vectors $\hat{x}_1, \hat{x}_2,.., \hat{x}_n$ . In 4D we have four orthogonal axes x,y,z,w defined by normal vectors $\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z}, \hat{w}$ . However these axes make six planes: $xy, xz, xw, yz, yw, zw$ . Are these planes orthogonal to each other? For example, the normal vectors $\hat{z}$ and $\hat{w}$ are perpendicular to the plane $xy$ , but they are orthogonal, i.e $\hat{z}\cdot \hat{w}=0$ , not parallel. How it is possible that they are not parallel when they are perpendicular to the same plane and how we check if the plane $xy$ is orthogonal to the plane $wz$ ?","['geometry', 'linear-algebra']"

52798,Distinguishable painted prisms with six colors (repetition allowed),"Fraleigh(7th) Ex17.9: A rectangular prism 2 ft long with 1-ft square ends is to have each of its six faces painted with one of six possible colors. How many distinguishable painted prisms are possible if each color may be used on any number of faces? I solved it but the answer is different from mine. I think my answer is right, but I haven't seen any error in the solution. Here is the solution. We use Burnside's formula: (number of orbits in $X$ under $G$)=$\frac 1 {|G|} \cdot \sum_{g \in G}|X_g|$. In this problem, the group $G$ of the prism has order $8$, four positions leaving the end faces in the same position and four positions with the end faces swapped. The set $X$ of possible ways of painting the prism has $6^6$ elements. We have $|X\text{_id}|=6^6$, $|X\text{_(same ends, rotate 90° or 270°)}|=6^3$, $|X\text{_(same ends, rotate 180°)}|=6^4$, $|X\text{_(swap ends, keeping top face on top)}|=6^4$, $|X\text{_(swap ends, as above, rotate 90° or 270°)}|=6^2$, $|X\text{_(swap ends, as above, rotate 180°)}|=6^3$: But I think this should be $6^4$. If you swap ends(keeping top face on top) and then rotate $180°$, the left and right faces are fixed and top-bottom, front-back is interchanged. So there are $6^4$ fixed elements as same to swapping ends keeping top face on top case. Who is right? And is there a proof by elementary(or combinatoric??) method without using group-theory? I haven't studied combinatorics in college so I don't know how this problem will be solved by combinatorics. Does it also use group-theory and Burnside's formula, etc.?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'combinatorics']"
52802,On sorting in an array-less language,"This is partly a programming and partly a combinatorics question. I'm working in a language that unfortunately doesn't support array structures. I've run into a problem where I need to sort my variables in increasing order. Since the language has functions for the minimum and maximum of two inputs (but the language does not allow me to nest them, e.g. min(a, min(b, c)) is disallowed), I thought this might be one way towards my problem. If, for instance, I have two variables $a$ and $b$, I only need one temporary variable so that $a$ ends up being less than or equal to $b$: t = min(a, b);
b = max(a, b);
a = t; for three variables $a,b,c$, the situation is a little more complicated, but only one temporary variable still suffices so that $a \leq b \leq c$: a = min(a, b);
t = max(a, b);
c = max(t, c);
t = min(t, c);
b = max(a, t);
a = min(a, t); Not having a strong combinatorics background, however, I don't know how to generalize the above constructions if I have $n$ variables in general. In particular, is there a way to figure out how many temporary variables I would need to sort out $n$ variables, and to figure out what is the minimum number of assignment statements needed for sorting? Thanks in advance!",['combinatorics']
52803,Hausdorff dimension of graphs of one-dimensional Brownian motion,"First question here, my apologies if it is a duplicate or inappropriate. There is a page on Wikipedia listing fractals by Hausdorff dimension and it includes the graph of a ""regular Brownian function"" as having Hausdorff dimension 1.5. Does this mean that a Brownian motion has Hausdorff dimension almost always, or is it the expected value, or something else? I've tried to look for references (besides the Wikipedia one that I can't get) and googling for more information to little avail. If it's not true that the graph of a Brownian motion has Hausdorff dimension 1.5 almost always, is it true that the Hausdorff dimension >1 almost always?","['brownian-motion', 'probability', 'fractals']"

52811,"Why is it ""easier"" to work with function fields than with algebraic number fields?","I just bought a copy of Jürgen Neukirch's book Algebraic Number Theory. While browsing through it I found a section titled § 14. Function Fields in chapter I. In it the author describes some aspects of an analogy between function fields and algebraic number fields . This led me to google for a while and I ended up reading the Wikipedia entry for Global Field . And this is where my question comes from. In the last sentence of that entry there's the following passage, which I find really interesting: It is usually easier to work in the function field case and then try to develop parallel techniques on the number field side. The development of Arakelov theory and its exploitation by Gerd Faltings in his proof of the Mordell conjecture is a dramatic example. Unfortunately, being as dramatic as it is, the example mentioned does not tell me anything because not even the Wikipedia entry on Arakelov Theory is somehow close to give even a small hint as to what it is about. So I would like to ask for some insight and/or examples that illustrate why it is said to be easier to work with function fields than with algebraic number fields and then try to develop parallel techniques for the number field case.

52843,When do series converge to meromorphic functions on $\mathbb{C}~$?,"I am working through exercises in Lang's Complex Analysis 3e, and have a problem.. Chapter 5, Section 3, Problem 1: Show that the following series define a meromorphic function on $\mathbb{C}$ and determine the set of poles, and their orders. (a) $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^n}{n!(n+z)}~~~~~~$(b) $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(nz)}{n!(n^2+z^2)}~~~~~~$(c) $\dfrac{1}{z}+\displaystyle\sum_{\substack{n\neq0\\n=-\infty}}^{\infty}\Bigg[\frac{1}{z-n}+\dfrac{1}{n}\Bigg]$ Now each term $f_n$ of (a) is holomorphic everywhere except at $z=-n$ which is a simple pole.  These will carry over to be simple poles in the sum, at all of the negative integers. Similarly, (b) has simple poles at each non-zero integer, (c) has simple poles at all of the integers. How do we conclude that an infinite sum of meromorphic functions is meromorphic?  Do I need to show that they converge?  Why is this enough? Also, if the numerator of (b) were $\sin(\pi z)$ would this change the order/existence of the poles?","['sequences-and-series', 'complex-analysis']"
52846,Method for variable substitution in multiple summation,"I asked this question on mathoverflow , someone suggested me to ask
  here as well. So I post it here. Thanks for helping. I want to ask: is there any general method for variable substitution in multiple summation? For example in the following equation a new variable $\lambda=n+m-2\mu$ is introduced to transform the LHS to the RHS 
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{m=0}^\infty \sum_{\mu=0}^{\left\lfloor \frac{m+n}{2}\right\rfloor}f(n,m,\mu,n+m-2\mu) = \sum_{\lambda=0}^\infty \sum_{\mu=0}^\infty \sum_{n=0}^{2\mu+\lambda}f(n,2\mu+\lambda-n,\mu,\lambda)$$ Another example, in which a new variable $\delta=m+n+2 p-2 k-2 \mu-2 \sigma$ is introduced $$\sum _{n=0}^{\infty } \sum _{m=0}^{\infty } \sum _{p=0}^M \sum _{k=0}^p \sum _{\sigma =0}^{p-k}\quad \sum _{\mu =0}^{\left\lfloor
   \frac{m+n}{2}+p-k-\sigma \right\rfloor } f(n,m,\mu ,p,k,\sigma ,m+n+2 p-2 k-2 \mu-2 \sigma )$$
$$=
\sum _{\delta =0}^{\infty } \sum _{\mu =0}^{\infty } \sum _{p=0}^M \quad\sum _{\beta =0}^{\min \left(p,\left\lfloor \frac{\delta
   }{2}+\mu \right\rfloor \right)}\quad \sum _{n=0}^{2 (\mu -\beta )+\delta }\quad \sum _{k=0}^{p-\beta }\;\; f(n,\delta +2 \mu-2 \beta -n,\mu
   ,p,k,p-\beta -k,\delta ) $$ Additional remarks: my goal is using a new summation index, e.g. $\lambda$, to express a particular linear combination of the old indices, which is appointed by me, e.g. $n+m-2\mu$. So this is a linear coordinate transformation. My problem is how to determine all the lower and upper bounds of the new summation indices frame, as well as the summation steps which are possibly not $1$. I wonder whether there is a systematical and efficient technology, so I may be able to do those transformations automatically by programming.","['discrete-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series', 'combinatorics']"

52856,Is Noetherian condition always needed when speaking of a coherent sheaf?,"To be precise, I want to strengthen the second part of Proposition 5.4 Chapter 2 in Hartshorne GTM 52 as follows: Let $X$ be a sheme, then an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module $\mathscr{F}$ is coherent if and only if for every open affine subset $U=SpecA$ of $X$, there is an $A$-module $M$ such that $\mathscr{F}\mid_U\cong\widetilde{M}$, and $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module. By the defination of coherent sheaf (Hartshorne p.111), it only claims the existence of a cover of $X$ satisfies such property(i.e. ""if"" part comes by free).

52863,Number of ways to multiply elements with a non-associative operation,"The question comes from considerations in algebra but it's probably more related to combinatorics. Suppose I have a set of $n$ elements $(a, b, c, ...)$ and a possibly non-associative operation $*$ between these elements. What I want to do is to count the number of elements I could obtain with this operation without interchanging the order of the elements. Let me illustrate this. Here below the parentheses mean that the operation has higher priority (usual notation). For $a$ and $b$, there is only 1 way to multiply them: $a * b$. For $a$, $b$ and $c$, we can have 2: $a*(b*c)$ or $(a*b)*c$. For $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$, there are 5: $(a*b)*(c*d)$, $((a*b)*c)*d$, $(a*(b*c))*d$, $a*((b*c)*d)$ or $a*(b*(c*d))$.

52869,Numerical approximation of Levy Flight,"I'm trying to produce a computer simulation of a Levy Flight in 2-dimensions; an approximation would be ok. Please excuse the simplistic level of this question: my maths is very rusty. My proposed method of plotting the Levy Flight is as follows: Start at the origin, and plot a connected series of points, each being in a random direction $\theta$ and a distance f from the previous point, where the size of f conforms to a power law distribution. Wikipedia suggests this should be of the form $y=x^{-a}$ where $1<a<3$. My problem is that I can't see how to generate values of f using a random number generator: I understand that I can use for example x = rand(1) which will with equal probability (allowing for the limitations of numerical accuracy and pseudo-randomness) take any value between 0 and 1. But here's where my limited math skills start to let me down: to transform this into a suitable value of f , I think I would need to use a 'cumulative distribution function' cdf(x), which maps my equally probable values of x onto some corresponding values of f . I also suspect that cdf(x) would basically be related the integral of $y=x^{-a}$, however I can't see exactly how to do this: Do I need to somehow scale $y=x^{-a}$ so the area under it sums to 1 (in order to be a valid probability density function)? I can't see how this is possible, unless I approximate using discrete values of $x$ and/or choosing a limited interval for values of $x$. Alternatively, could I do an approximation to this by the following method:(1) select a nominal start value of f , say 1. (2) if rand(1)>t (where t is an arbitrary threshold value) then set f=f*k (say k=1.2) and repeat step 2, otherwise stop and use the current value of f . If someone could offer some pointers, I would be very grateful. Thank you. EDIT: Thank you to Chris for the prompt answer which works perfectly! So for $\alpha = 3$ and $x_{\mathrm{min}} = 1$, when I choose 100,000 random values of u in [0,1] I get this distribution of values of $F^{-1}(u) = x_{\mathrm{min}} (1-u)^{-1/\alpha}$: ... which is just what I'm after (there's a little blip at the end for truncated values of $x>8$). In fact, since u is evenly distributed I can get exactly the same distribution using $F^{-1}(u) = u^{-1/\alpha}$ which is shorter. Here's a typical flight plot (for $\alpha=1.5$, 1000 steps): EDIT: Matlab code for the above example: alpha=1.5;
s=1000;
x=zeros(1,s);
y=zeros(1,s);

    theta=rand*2*pi;
    f=rand^(-1/alpha);

52876,"Two ""different"" adjoints of exterior derivative on manifolds with boundary in the $L^2$-setting","The follow problem appears in the setting of $L^2$-differential forms on manifolds with boundary. An abstracted operator theoretic problem is given below. Suppose $M$ is a smooth Riemannian manifold with boundary. We have an inner product and the Hodge star on differential forms. $\langle \omega , \eta \rangle = \int_M \omega \wedge \star \eta$ We have the Cartan derivative $d$ as an unbounded operator, with its domain being suitably regular differential forms. For $\omega, \eta$ smooth and compactly supported we now have $\langle d\omega,\eta \rangle = \langle \omega, \delta \eta \rangle$ with $\delta := \star d \star$. Now, with algebraic properties of the exterior derivative, we can show more general for $\omega \in dom(d)$ and $\eta \in dom(\delta)$ $\int_M d\omega\wedge\star\eta = \int_M \omega\wedge\star \delta\eta + \int_{\partial M} \operatorname{Tr}\omega \wedge \star \operatorname{Tr}\eta$ so in general a trace term appears. In particular, $\delta$ is not the hermitian adjoint of $d$. We can fix this and define the unbounded operator $d^\ast$ with the same action as $\delta$ but smaller domain, namely
$dom(d^\ast) = \{ \eta \in L^2\Lambda \mid \operatorname{Tr}\star\eta = 0 \}$ Assuming I have not committed any serious fallacies, now to my problem. This difference between $d^\ast$ and $\delta$ does not appear in the setting of manifolds with boundary, and literature on this and the $L^2$ exterior calculus is not as ubiquitous as literature on the fully smooth setting without boundary. However, both $d^\ast$ and $\delta$ are used. So, whereas $d^\ast$ is the adjoint, what is $\delta$? I am interested to understand this from a purely operator theoretic point of view (i.e. functional analysis). Of particular interst for me is whether the adjoint of a linear unbounded operator with respect to a pairing may be extended in a canonical way such that ""defects"" which disturb the adjointness-relation appear ( just as the trace terms above )?","['operator-theory', 'differential-forms', 'functional-analysis']"

To quote page 398: We divide the complex number b by a: $b=aw$, where $w=x+yi$ a complex number, not necessarily a Gauss integer. The we choose the nearest Gauss integer point $(m,n)$ to $(x,y)$, writing $x=m+x_0,y=n+y_0$, where m,n are integers and $x_0,y_0$ real numbers such that $-1/2\leq x_0,y_0<1/2$. Then $(m+ni)a$ is the required point of $Ra$. For, $\left|x_0 + y_0i\right|^2<1/2$ and $|b-(m+ni)a|^2=|a(x_0+y_0i)|^2<\frac{1}{2}|a|^2$. I have two questions: I assume he's using the notation $\left|a+bi\right|=\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. If so, it seems like $\left|x_0 + y_0i\right|^2<1/2$ is not always true since $\left|(-1/2)+(-1/2)i\right|^2=1/2$ He never uses the identity $i^2=-1$, so it seems like this proof could be expanded to all rings $\mathbb Z[x]/(x^2 + a)$, or indeed anything which has a vectorspace-like structure like $\mathbb Z^2$. But I remember hearing that $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not Euclidean - why does this proof fail for $x^2 = -5$? EDIT : $\sqrt{-5}\approx 2.2i$ so we can write for example $3i \approx 1.3\sqrt{-5}$. By my understanding, $y_0=.3$ here and the norm $|0+.3|=0^2+.3^2$ is less than one. Furthermore, every $x_0,y_0$ is less than $1/2$, so this norm will always be less than 1, which is all we need.

52944,How to calculate the local factor at the infinite place of a function field?,"First of all, my apologies for the long-winded nature of this question! Yesterday, Mr. Barquero asked an excellent question regarding function fields and number theory: Why is it ""easier"" to work with function fields than with algebraic number fields? I had a follow-up question of my own:
Starting with the simplest kind of function field, i.e. $\mathbb F_q(T)$ where $q$ is a prime, we can calculate the zeta function over the ring $\mathbb F_q[T]$ to be:$$\Gamma_{\mathbb F_q[T]}(s)=\sum_{\mathfrak a \neq 0}N\mathfrak a^{-s}=\sum_{d=0}^\infty q^d(q^d)^{-s}=1/(1-q^{1-s})$$
In order to write down a functional equation, I need to include a local factor corresponding to the infinite place. My question is: How to do that correctly, in the machinery used in Tate's thesis, and without direct recourse to the Riemann-Roch theorem? I know the answer I am looking to get to is this:$$\xi(s)=\frac{q^{-s}}{(1-q^{-s})(1-q^{1-s})}$$ I can get part of this.  Similarly to the calculation in the global field $\mathbb Q$, $$\int_{\mathbb R^\times} e^{-\pi x^2}|x|^{s-1}dx=\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2),$$ I can write down the local zeta factor:$$\sum_{d=0}^\infty q^{-sd}=(1-q^{-s})^{-1},$$
but I'm not sure how to arrive at the factor $q^{-s}$ in the numerator of the expression for $\xi(s)$. Is this a local epsilon factor?  Is there an elementary way to calculate it without invoking the machinery of Riemann-Roch?","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

$$ a (f,f)_1 \leq (f,f)_2 \leq b(f,f)_1 \quad \forall f \in \mathcal H  $$
Suppose that the metric induced by $(\cdot,\cdot)_i$ makes $(\mathcal H,(\cdot,\cdot)_i)$ a Hilbert space.
In this way we get an equivalence relation $\sim$ on the set $X$ of the inner products on $\mathcal H$. If $A : \mathcal H \to \mathcal H$ is, with respect to the inner product of $\mathcal H$, a positive, invertible self-adjoint operator then
$$ \mathcal H \times \mathcal H \ni (f,g) \mapsto (Af,g) \in\mathbb C $$

If $H,K \in X$ are such that $H \sim K$, is it true that $H$ and $K$ are related by an operator $A : (\mathcal H,H) \to (\mathcal H,H)$ as in the previous point? What can be said on $\tilde X := X/\sim$? How many inequivalent inner products on $\mathcal H$ are there? Is there a way to classify them? For the second point, assuming that $(\mathcal H,H)$ and $(\mathcal H,K)$ are separable, I thought to take two complete orthonormal systems $\{a_i\}_{i \in I}$ on $(\mathcal H,H)$ and $\{b_i\}_{i \in I}$ on $(\mathcal H,K)$ and define $A := T^* T$, where $T : (\mathcal H,H) \to (\mathcal H,H)$ is defined by
$$ f \mapsto Tf := \sum_{i \in I} K(f,b_i) a_i $$
In this way, using $H(a_i,a_j) = \delta_{ij} = K(b_i,b_j)$ ,
$$ \begin{align*} H(f,Ag) = H(Tf,Tg) &= \sum_{i,j,k \in I} K(f,b_i) H(a_i,a_j) K(b_j,g) \\

52999,"In a group, the number of non-self-inverse elements is even","The problem I am attempting to prove is the following: In any finite group $G$, the number of elements not equal to their own inverse is an even number. Caveat : I have had very limited experience with proofs. Any comments would be appreciated. Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}$ be elements of $G$. Since $G$ is a group, every element in $G$ must have an inverse in $G$. Let the inverse of each element be represented by $a_{1}^{-1}, a_{2}^{-1}, ..., a_{n}^{-1}$. An element $a_{k}$ in $G$ that is not equal to its own inverse can be written as $a_{k} \neq a_{k}^{-1}$. For every element $a_{k}$, there is another element $a_{k}^{-1}$ that is not equal to its own inverse denoted by $a_{k}^{-1} \neq a_{k}$. So for every element $a_{k}$ in $G$ whose inverse is not equal to their own inverse, there will be 2 elements in $G$ namely $a_{k}$ and $a_{k}^{-1}$. Let the integer $q$ denote the number of elements ranging from $a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}$ who are not equal to their own inverse. In addition for every value $q$, there must be another element in $a_{1}^{-1}, a_{2}^{-1}, ..., a_{n}^{-1}$ not equal to their own inverse. So the total number of elements not equal to their own inverse can be denoted by 2$q$, which is an even number.","['proof-writing', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
53001,"What's the ""limit"" in the definition of Riemann integrals?","Consider one of the standard methods used for defining the Riemann integrals : Suppose $\sigma$ denotes any subdivision $a=x_0<x_1<x_2\cdots<x_{n-1}<x_n=b$, and let $x_{i-1}\leq \xi_i\leq x_i$. Then if 
  $$|\sigma|:=\max\{x_i-x_{i-1}|i=1,\cdots,n\},$$
  which we shall call the norm of the subdivision, we define:
  $$\int_a^bf(x)dx:=\lim_{|\sigma|\to 0}\sum_{i=1}^nf(\xi_i)(x_i-x_{i-1}).$$ When one talks about the limit of a function $\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)$, one has exactly one value $f(x)$ for every $x$. However, for every $|\sigma|$, the value of the Riemann sum $\sum_{i=1}^nf(\xi_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})$ is not necessarily unique. Using the $\epsilon$-$\delta$ language, one may restate the definition as follows: Suppose $f:[a,b]\to{\mathbb R}$, $J\in{\mathbb R}$. If for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that for any subdivision $\sigma$ and $\{\xi_i\}$ on $\sigma$ (i.e. $x_{i-1}\leq \xi_i\leq x_i$), $|\sigma|<\delta$ implies
  $$|\sum_{i=1}^nf(\xi_i)\Delta x_i-J|<\epsilon,$$

Aesthetically, this seems kind of ugly to me. The real line is a high-tech piece of mathematical machinery. We build up all that structure, then build the definition of a manifold out of it, then throw away most of the structure. It seems kind of like building an airplane by taking a tank, adding wings, and getting rid of the armor and the gun turret. I've spent some time trying to figure out a definition that would better suit my delicate sensibilities, and have come up with the following sketch:
An $n$-dimensional manifold is a completely normal, second-countable, locally connected topological space that has Lebesgue covering dimension $n$, is a homogeneous space under its own homeomorphism group, and is a complete uniform space. Does this work? I should reveal at this point that I'm a physicist, and no more than a pathetic dilettante at math. I have never had a formal course in topology. My check on my proposed definition consisted of buying a copy of Steen's Counterexamples in Topology and flipping through it to try to find examples that would invalidate my proposed definition.

Let $\mathbf s',\mathbf s''\in S$ be equivalent ($\mathbf s'\sim \mathbf s''$) if $|\mathbf s'| = |\mathbf s''|$ and $\mathbf s''$ can be obtained by $\mathbf s'$ by only permuting elements of $\mathbf s'$. Say, $\{1,2,3\}\sim\{2,3,1\}$. 3. Define an addition of sequences in the following way:
$$
\mathbf s = \mathbf s'+\mathbf s'' = \{s'_1,...,s'_{k},s''_1,...,s''_{l}\}.

where $k=|\mathbf s'|$ and $l = |\mathbf s''|$ and multiplication by scalar:

$$
\max \mathbf s = \max_{1\leq i\leq |s|}s_i,

Some thoughts: a) if we put $S$ to be a class of real-valued continuous maps with compact domains from $\mathbb R$ then we can extend these three functions to admit the same property. Moreover, the outcome for each of these functions will be in an image of $\mathbf s$. b) all these three functions are constant on class of equivalence $[\mathbf s]$ for any $\mathbf s\in S$. c) For sure, $\overline{\mathbf s}$ is an expectation with respect to class of uniform probability measures each of them defined over a finite set. So, we can extend it to a wider class of measures. On the other hand, then we will lose the property b) . d) Constant function of course also admit these property, however is not of too much interest.","['sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

$$a B_1\pm\sqrt{a^2 B_1^2 - C_1(b^2 h^2 - 2 A_1 b^2 h)} = a B_2\pm\sqrt{a^2 B_2^2 - C_2 (b^2 h^2 - 2 A_2 b^2 h)} \quad (1)$$ where $A = x\cos\alpha +y\sin\alpha$, $B = -x\sin\alpha+y\cos\alpha$ and $C = a^2 B^2 + A^2 b^2 - a^2 b^2$. Now the only thing I need to get is $h$ from (1). All other values are known, but I am not able to single that out. Anyway if the above equations looks insane then please solve it yourself, your way.

53101,The definition for the differential of a morphism,"I am learning Linear Algebraic Groups without enough knowledge on Algebraic Groups. I see the definition for the differential of a morphism on page 42 of James Humphreys' Linear Algebraic Groups (GTM 21): Let $\phi: X \rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of (irreducible) varieties. If $x \in X$, $y = \phi(x)$, then $\phi^*$ maps $(\mathcal{o}_y, \mathcal{m}_y)$ into $(\mathcal{o}_x, \mathcal{m}_x)$. By composition with $\phi^*$, a linear function x on $\mathcal{m}_x/ \mathcal{m}_x^2$ therefore induces a linear function on $d \phi _x($x$)$ on $\mathcal{m}_y/ \mathcal{m}_y^2$. The resulting map $d \phi_x: \mathcal{T}(X)_x \rightarrow \mathcal{T}(Y)_y$ is evidently $K$-linear. We call it the differential of $\phi$ at $x$. Here, $K$ is an algebraically closed field. $\phi^*: K[Y] \rightarrow K[X]$, $f \mapsto f \circ \phi$. $\mathcal{o}_x$ (resp. $\mathcal{o}_y$) represents the local ring of regular functions at $x$ (resp. $y$) with maximal ideal $\mathcal{m}_x$ (resp. $\mathcal{m}_y$). I think, if $\phi^*$ maps $(\mathcal{o}_y, \mathcal{m}_y)$ into $(\mathcal{o}_x, \mathcal{m}_x)$, and x is a linear function on $\mathcal{m}_x/ \mathcal{m}_x^2$, then the composition x$\circ \phi^*$ will map $\mathcal{m}_y/ \mathcal{m}_y^2$ to $\mathcal{m}_x/ \mathcal{m}_x^2$. Why would it be an element of $\mathcal{T}(Y)_y$, i.e., a map from $\mathcal{m}_y/ \mathcal{m}_y^2$ to itself? Are there any mistakes in my understanding? Or are there any equivalent definitions that are easier to follow? Sincere thanks.",['algebraic-geometry']
53115,Trigonometric sums related to the Verlinde formula,"Original question (see also the revised, possibly simpler, version below): Let $g > 1, r > 1$ be integers. Playing around with the Verlinde formula (see below), I came across the expression
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} \sin(\pi n/r)^{2-2g} (e^{2\pi i n^2/r}-1).$$ My goal is to reduce the complexity in $r$ of this expression; that is, to find a closed form of the sum avoiding the dependence on $r$ in the number of summands. Is this possible? Here's a related example: The Verlinde formula, which e.g. has applications in conformal field theory, algebraic geometry, and quantum topology, is
$$(r/2)^{g-1}\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} \sin(\pi n/r)^{2-2g}.$$
In this case, one can use a trick by Szenes to reduce the complexity of the sum: The sum can be written as
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} f(z_n).$$
where $z_n = e^{\pi i n/r}$, for a suitable meromorphic function $f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ having poles only at $1$ and $-1$. Now the trick essentially is to find a suitable meromorphic form $\mu_r$ having poles at $2r$'th roots of unity and apply the Residue Theorem to $f\mu_k$ to rewrite the above sum as
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} f(z_n) = -\text{Res}_{z=1} f\mu_r,$$
which then turns out to be a polynomial in $r$ of degree $2g-2$. This trick doesn't seem to apply to my slightly more complicated sum though. Another possibility might be to somehow rewrite the sum as a Gauss sum, but that doesn't quite seem to work either. ""Revised"" question : So, maybe the question above does not have a straightforward answer, but I believe it might suffice to be able to work out the following (at least, it's a similar problem). Say we just have a sum like
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} e^{\pi i n^2/(2r)}$$
as above (almost, anyway). Then we may apply a quadratic reciprocity theorem to simplify matters. But say now that we throw in a power of $n$ to get something like
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} n^k e^{\pi i n^2/(2r)},$$
for $k > 0$. Can sums like these be treated in a similar manner as the quadratic Gauss sum above (perhaps just in special cases like $k = 1$, or $k = 2$); can we somehow describe the large $r$ asymptotics? Standard tricks in this field seem to involve summation by parts and the Euler--Maclaurin formula but it doesn't seem to quite work out. For example, in the case $k = 1$, summation by parts (or elementary combinatorial considerations) will imply
$$\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} n e^{\pi i n^2/(2r)} = (r-1)\sum_{n=1}^{r-1} e^{\pi in^2/(2r)} - \sum_{j=1}^{r-1}\sum_{n=1}^j e^{\pi in^2/(2r)}.$$

I hope I can narrow down the question well so that one can offer some ideas. In a lot of calculus textbooks, there is usually a chapter about ""applications"" after the one for Riemann integral. Students can do a lot of calculations and appreciate the power of Riemann integration --- they solve many problems in physics and geometry. While learning the Lebesgue integral, or more generally, integration on measure space, I cannot appreciate the power of this kind of integration util I learn some modern PDE. One the other hand, I found that there are much much more inequalities when doing Lebesgue integration than equations when applying Riemann integral. Instead of calculating something, people do estimation with the convergence theorems. Here are my questions: How do people apply Lebesgue integration theory? If putting the methods into categories, can I say that it primarily deals with the problems related to convergence ? What's the fundamental difference between applying these two different integration techniques? Is there an example such that people solve some problem which may be very hard (but still can be solved) when using Riemann integral but relatively easy with Lebesgue integral?","['applications', 'multivariable-calculus', 'measure-theory', 'soft-question', 'real-analysis']"

Improve this question If I had access to potentially large number of CPUs and wanted to quickly check 100 million digit numbers for primality using a map-reduce architecture, how many CPUs would be necessary? Each of the mapped compute instances would perform efficient checks against the number in question with an assigned range of divisors (e.g. Instance 1: checks divisors 2-1000, Instance 2: checks divisors 1001-2000, ... etc.). Definitions: quickly means checking a single divisor against the 100 million digit number within hours. efficient division means only checking the odd numbers up to the square root. Lower divisors would be only the known prime numbers to speed up computation. 1 CPU is the equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor. Yes, I know there are better algorithms like AKS but I need to be able to divide the work among the mapped instances. If there is a better way to divide and conquer I am all ears.

The textbook went on to note that this defined a finitely additive set function on every subset of $[0,1]$ via allowing our set function $w(A) = \ell(\chi_{A})$.  It goes on to note that, for Borel sets, this actually forms the Lebesgue measure. Question 1. What is the reason for the ""finitely additive"" part of $w$ in the latter paragraph?  Is it just because we required bounded functions? Question 2. How can one see that this forms the Lebesgue measure if we consider Borel Measurable sets?  I do not think this comes from Hahn-Banach.

""Prove that if f is a continuous complex valued function in the open subset G of the complex plane, and if the integral of $f(z)dz = 0$ over every rectangle R, with edges parallel to the coordinate axes, contained with its interior in G, then f is holomorphic"" (Sarason Complex Function Theory 2nd edition). Following the logic the book used to show this was true for triangular regions, I came up with this seemingly roundabout way of proving it, which I know works, but seems very roundabout. Basically the book proves the other direction for triangles, so I can just modify that proof, and then the book uses the triangle theorem to prove Cauchy's Theorem for a convex region. It is easy to substitute the rectangle theorem, for the triangle theorem. While I'm glad this works, and its almost directly lifted from the textbook, it is over 2 pages long, so I was wondering if a more direct approach could be found. Proof Summary: ""Our approach will be to first that if f is holomorphic the integral around every rectangle of $f(z)dz$ equals 0. We will then apply this fact to prove Cauchy's Theorem for a convex region. Once this is complete we can note that this new proof of Cauchy's Theorem allows us to say that if f has integral zero around every rectangle contained in G, f has a primitive in G. If f has a primitive in G, it is holomorphic."" Edit: Also I was thinking that since we've gone through the proof in the textbook and it works for triangles, if we can somehow divide the rectangle into 2 triangles and show that the integral around each of these triangles is equal to zero, then the rest follows from the book's derivations based on triangles, though honestly this seems very difficult to do.",['complex-analysis']

53481,What type of curve is $\left|\dfrac{x}{a}\right|^{z} + \left|\dfrac{y}{b}\right|^{z} = 1$?,"In order to fit experimental data, I want to use a Cartesian equation which looks like: $\left|\dfrac{x}{a}\right|^{z} + \left|\dfrac{y}{b}\right|^{z} = 1$ $a$, $b$, $c$, and $z$ can take any real value, except the impossible ones ($a = 0$ or $b = 0$, for instance). First, I look for a name for this equation because I can't find more information about it if I can't name it. As far as I know, ellipsoids, paraboloids, or hyperboloids are not helpful here, since with those specific cases, $z = 2$, and that's all. Any idea?

53499,Can a continuous map $S^2 \rightarrow S^2$ preserve orthogonality without being an isometry?,"Suppose I have a map $\phi: S^2 \rightarrow S^2$ and I know that a) $\phi$ is continuous and bijective b) If $a$ and $b$ subtend an angle of $\pi / 2$ at the center of the sphere, then so do $\phi(a)$ and $\phi(b)$. Does it follow that $\phi$ is an isometry of the sphere? If yes, can you sketch a proof? If no, can you furnish an example of a non-isometry $\phi$ satisfying the above? (Also, in either case, is the requirement that $\phi$ be bijective redundant?)","['linear-algebra', 'riemannian-geometry', 'projective-geometry']"
53501,"If $X_1, ..., X_n$ are Exp($\lambda$) random variables, what is the best unbiased estimator of $e^{-\lambda}$?","Let $X_1, ..., X_n$ be random variables with pdf $$\frac 1 \lambda e^{-x / \lambda} I(x > 0).$$ The goal is to find the best unbiased estimator of $h(\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}$ (incidentally, this is equal to $P(X_1 > \lambda^2)$). I'm currently tutoring some graduate students for a first year qualifying examination and in an embarrassing turn of events I've been unable to figure out the solution to this problem on a past exam. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious. Some thoughts: the MLE of $h(\lambda)$ is $e^{-\bar X}$. The expectation can be calculated easily, but it is hopelessly biased: $$E[e^{-\bar X}] = M_{\bar X} (-1) = M_{X_1} \left(-\frac 1 n\right)^n = \left(1 + \frac \lambda n\right)^{-n}$$ where $M_Y$ is the moment generating function of $Y$. There are only two ways of going about this that I can think of that are available to the students. One is to ""guess"" a $g(\bar X)$ such that $E[g(\bar X)] = e^{-\lambda}$. The other is to find an unbiased estimate of $e^{-\lambda}$ and Rao-Blackwell to finish it off (a prior part to the same question essentially sets up the ability to carry out such a calculation, so it is somewhat hinted at that this might work).","['statistics', 'probability']"

53526,How many bananas can a camel deliver without eating them all?,"This is a fun puzzle I was assigned on the first day of highschool (over a decade ago).  I just dug it up randomly from under my bed and thought I'd share it with the SE community. At the time, I found a better solution than even the Puzzle book had, and nobody was able to come up with a better answer... A farmer has 3000 bananas that will be sold at a supermarket located 1000 kilometers away.  To get them there, he has a camel that is strong enough to carry 1000 bananas at a time, but will eat 1 banana for each kilometer it walks.  Will the camel successfully deliver any bananas to the supermarket?  If yes, how many, and how?

53552,Representations of p-adic integers as certain infinite sums,"One way to define the p-adic integers is as the $p$-adic completion of $\mathbb{Z}$. With some additional work, it can be shown that this is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]/(x-p)$. Now, I know that another approach is to define $\mathbb{Z}_p$ as the ring of power series with powers of $p$ and coefficients from ${0, 1,..., p-1}$. My question is: How can we see that the first definition of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ coincides with the second definition? and how can we find an explicit isomorphism from $\mathbb{Z}[[x]]/(x-p)$ to the ring of power series described above?","['ring-theory', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

In the introduction of the subject, I am curious as to why there is no need for there to be a multiplicative identity.

But what is the reason for the monoid, rather than group under multiplication--or lack of multiplication?","['ring-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'definition']"
53558,Bases for exterior powers,"I've seen the following claim several times: If $V$ is a vector space over $K$ with basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ then the basis to the kth exterior power of $V$ is given by the elements $$\{e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge\cdots\wedge e_{i_k} \mid 1 \le  i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \le n\}$$ Now, given some basic facts on exterior powers, it's not hard to show that the above set actually spans the $k$th exterior power. On the other hand, I've never seen a complete proof of the linear independence of this set. So my question is: What is the simplest way to show that $\{e_{i_1}\wedge e_{i_2}\wedge\cdots \wedge e_{i_k} \mid 1 \le  i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \le n\}$ is linearly independent?","['linear-algebra', 'multilinear-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
