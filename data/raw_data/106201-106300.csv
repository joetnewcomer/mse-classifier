1508070,Introduction a good text on principal bundle,"Is there a good text that teaches principal bundle or frame bundle? I am looking for a textbook that might serve as an introduction to topology of principal bundles or frame bundles, specially the global frame field and  the connection on them. Currently, the only book I know of in this regard is: ""Lectures on Differential Geometry"" by S. S. Chern & W. H. Chen & K. S. Lam I have been reading it, but I am occasionally frustrated by the lack of more details on the global section on frame bundles.

1508125,Uncountable random graphs,"There is a theorem from Erdos and Renyi that says that a random graph on $\aleph_0$ vertices (where each pair of vertices is connected with probability equal to $\frac{1}{2}$) will be isomorphic to the Rado graph with probability 1.  Does an analogous result hold for random graphs on $\kappa$ vertices, for $\kappa > \aleph_0$?  The proof I have read of the Erdos-Renyi theorem does not appear to generalize to larger cardinals. More generally, how does one compute probabilities in cases like this (where, in general, the sample space and the event are both sets of the same cardinality $\lambda > 2^{\aleph_0}$.

1508160,Prove that a graph is a maximal planar graph if and only if $e = 3v − 6$,"Definition: A planar graph with no multi-edges $G$ is called a maximal planar graph if the graph formed by addition of any edge (not already in the $G$) is not planar or the graph is $K_3 $ or $K_4$ (in these cases we can't add any more edges!) I am asked to prove that a graph is maximally planar if and only if $e = 3v - 6$. To prove the first direction (If the graph is maximal then $e = 3v-6$) $\longrightarrow$ I use the fact that every face in a maximal planar graph is a triangle and that every edge is incident to exactly two faces, and so we have $$ 3f = 2e \to f = \frac{2e}{3}$$ Now I substitue this value of $f$ Euler's formula $$v + f = e + 2$$ to get $$v + \frac{2e}{3} = e  + 2$$ and so we have $$e - \frac{2e}{3} + 2 = v$$ and so we have $$\frac{e}{3} = v - 2$$
and so we finally get $$e = 3v - 6$$ $ \longleftarrow$ Now I have some troubles in proving that other direction, that is if $e = 3v-6$ then the graph if maximal planar. I was thinking by mathematical induction on the number of vertices. But I am lost on how to even begin, what will be the least pair of $(e,v)$ for this to work, I assume $v=1,2$ both doesn't make any sense and so $v=3$ will be the least value, and if we have $v = 3$ then we would have $e= 3 \times 3 - 6 = 3$ so we would have three edges for $3$ vertices which is basically $k_3$ and so it works as a base case.","['discrete-mathematics', 'graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'planar-graphs']"

1508187,Prove that $f$ is injective iff $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$.,"Let $f$ be a function. Prove that $f$ is injective iff $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$ for all subsets $A$ and $B$ of the domain of $f$. I realize that this is a duplicate question, however the past post on this question doesn't make sense to me so I would like more clarification.  Here is the post that I have gone over: $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$ $\iff$ $f$ is injective. What I am not understanding is the general process of how to approach this proof.  I would think that the steps to proving this would go something like this: Assume $f$ is injective. Show that this implies that $f(A\cap B)\subset f(A)\cap f(B)$ and then show that it also implies that $f(A\cap B)\supset f(A)\cap f(B)$. Then double containment has been shown, so $f$ being injective implies that $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$. Now assume that $f(A\cap B)=f(A)\cap f(B)$ is true. Show that this implies that $f$ is injective. I wanted to approach this in two steps because of the ""if and only if"" statement. However, in the other example, only part number 1 is addressed.

1508214,"Over $\mathbb{R}$, is it still the case that the singular locus of a nonempty variety is a proper subvariety?","I thought through the argument in Hartshorne for algebraically closed fields  and I don't see any issues, but I would appreciate it if someone checked their intuition against this, since I don't know anything about real algebraic geometry. I imagine that something weird could happen because points are missing. Roughly the argument would go like this: Given a real affine variety $X$... Because $R$ is a perfect field, there is a separable trascendence basis for the function field. Hence $X$ is birational to a hypersurface. The singular locus of a nonempty irreducible hypersurface $Z(f)$ is a proper closed subvariety, since otherwise $f$ divides all of its derivatives, which implies that all of its derivatives are zero, hence it is the constant function. (I just want to conclude that the Grassmanian is a manifold by identifying it with the locally closed space of orthogonal projections inside $M_n(\mathbb{R})$, and observing that it is homogeneous because $GLn(R)$ acts transitively on it, hence the fact that it is generically smooth implies that it is smooth.

I would like to know if there is a procedure for taking $f$ and modifying it slightly to get $F \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ such that $F = f$ everywhere except for a small interval around $a$. Intuitively, I think the idea is to replace $f$ on some small interval $(a + \epsilon, a - \epsilon)$ by a smooth function, and then connect that function up to $f$ on either end (in a smooth way). But I'm not exactly sure if or how this can done (for instance, can we only get $F \in C^N(\mathbb{R})$?). I imagine that a convolution may need to be used. Is there a standard analysis book that gives a proof of this procedure, if in fact it can be done?

1508292,To prove the integral inequality $\int_\overline{\theta}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-\lambda \cos{\theta}}}\gt\pi$,"The following inequality comes up in connection with motion in a dipole field. One has to show that

The case $0\lt\lambda\lt 1$ is easily verified. For then $$\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-\lambda \cos{\theta}}}=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-\lambda \cos{\theta}}}+\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi}\frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-\lambda \cos{\theta}}}$$

1508304,Interior product and exterior product,"I have seen around the internet that this should hold: $$\iota_X(\alpha\wedge\beta)=\iota_X\alpha\wedge\beta+(-1)^k\alpha\wedge\iota_X\beta,$$ where $X$ is a vector field, $\alpha$ a $k$-form, $\beta$ an $\ell$-form, $\iota_X$ is the interior product (i.e. $\iota_X\alpha(v_1,\dotsc,v_{k-1})=\alpha(X,v_1,\dotsc,v_{k-1})$), and $\wedge$ is the exterior product. Now I define the exterior product as: $$\alpha\wedge\beta(v_1,\dotsc,v_k,v_{k+1},\dotsc,v_{k+\ell})=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{k+\ell}}\operatorname{sgn}\sigma\alpha(v_{\sigma(1)},\dotsc,v_{\sigma(k)})\beta(v_{\sigma(k+1)},\dotsc,v_{\sigma(k+\ell)}),$$ where some others define it with a coefficient in front of it involving factorials of $\ell$ and $k$. I tried all I could to prove the above identity. I reduced it to proving the case $\alpha=df$. And I'm simply stuck on that case. No matter what, there are sign problems. So could you help me figure this out? Are there coefficients missing with my definition of wedge btw?","['differential-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'exterior-algebra']"
1508355,A curious property of orthogonal matrices,"Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ orthogonal matrix, i.e. $AA^T=A^TA=I$. I noticed experimentally that if we take any increasing set of indices $i_1<\cdots<i_p$, then the sum of the squares of all possible minors with rows corresponding to $\{i_1,\ldots,i_p\}$ is equal to 1. This is a bit hard to formulate, so let me try to say what I mean more explicitly. Let
$$A=\begin{pmatrix}a_1^1&\ldots&a_1^n\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\a_n^1&\cdots&a_n^n\end{pmatrix}$$
and let
$$A_{i_1\ldots i_p}^{j_1\ldots j_p}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{i_1}^{j_1}&\ldots&a_{i_1}^{j_p}\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\a_{i_p}^{j_1}&\cdots&a_{i_p}^{j_p}\end{pmatrix}$$
for $i_1<\cdots<i_p$, $j_1<\cdots<j_p$ and $1\leq p\leq n$. Conjecture: If $A$ is orthogonal, then, for any $i_1<\cdots<i_p$ we have
  $$\sum_{j_1<\cdots<j_p}\left(\det A_{i_1\ldots i_p}^{j_1\ldots j_p}\right)^2=1,$$
  where the sum is over all increasing sets of $p$ indices. How do we prove such a thing? Is that even true? (The answer is very likely yes, as I have checked it for many random examples.) Note: The case $p=1$ is the statement that the rows of $A$ have unit norms, and the case $p=n$ is the statement that $(\det A)^2=1$. The conjecture generalizes these two statements. In particular, the conjecture is clearly true for $n=2$. Now, here is a slightly less trivial example: Example: Take
$$
A=
\begin{pmatrix}
1/\sqrt{2}&0&1/\sqrt{2}\\
-1/\sqrt{6}&\sqrt{2/3}&1/\sqrt{6}\\
1/\sqrt{3}&1/\sqrt{3}&-1/\sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}\in O(3).
$$
Then, with $p=2$ and $i_1=1$, $i_2=2$ we have
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
1/\sqrt{2}&0\\
-1/\sqrt{6}&\sqrt{2/3}
\end{vmatrix}^2
+
\begin{vmatrix}
1/\sqrt{2}&1/\sqrt{2}\\
-1/\sqrt{6}&1/\sqrt{6}
\end{vmatrix}^2
+
\begin{vmatrix}
0&1/\sqrt{2}\\
\sqrt{2/3}&1/\sqrt{6}
\end{vmatrix}^2
=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}=1.

1508604,Is my proof that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2}{3^n-2^n}$ converge correct?,"Is the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2}{3^n-2^n}$ convergent? My Approach: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{n^2}{3^n-2^n}$$ $$\lim_{n\to \infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|$$ So, I did this, and I will write down the simplified form because its hard to type big fractions: $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{(3^n-2^n)(n+1)^2}{(3^{n+1}-2^{n+1})n^2}=\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{(3^n-2^n)(n+1)^2}{(3\cdot3^n-2\cdot2^n)n^2}$$ Now all I have to do is prove that the denominator gets larger faster than the numerator. But the problem is unlike other questions both the numerator and the denominator have the same highest power. So: $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{(3^n-2^n)(n^2+\cdots)}{(3\cdot3^n-2\cdot2^n)n^2}$$ Divide by $n^2$: $$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{(3^n-2^n)}{(3\cdot3^n-2\cdot2^n)}$$ Other terms in the form $\frac{a}{n}$ and $\frac{b}{n^2}$ in the numerator go to zero, so I omitted writing that in latex. Now is this clear to show that the denominator is larger than the numerator? Because 3, and 2 seems small numbers, nothing compared to powers that we deal with in other questions. Also I know that this converges because I confirmed it on http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7Bn%5E2%7D%7B3%5En-2%5En%7D","['summation', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
1508609,Isoclinic rotations in four dimensions,"Given any collection of complementary, oriented (2D) planes in n-dimensional space, and an angle associated with each one, there is a unique rotation of the whole space which restricts to rotations in each plane by their given angles. Conversely, it's not impossible to prove all rotations of space arise in this way. Which leads to the question: can a single rotation arise in this way but from two different sets of complementary planes? If the attached angles are all distinct, I think the answer is no, which means the collection of stable planes is an invariant of ""almost all"" rotations (in the sense that the set of exceptions are of positive codimension in the group of all rotations). If any two of the attached angles are the same, though, then there are an infinite number of planes which are stable under the rotation. Indeed, it is easy to verify that such a rotation moves every ray from the origin by the same angle. (Compare with rotation around an axis in 3D: if a ray is perpendicular to the axis then it is rotated by the full angle, but otherwise if the ray is closer to the axis, the before and after rays will be less than the full angle apart from each other.) For simplicity, lets just take n=4 so our isoclinic rotations are rotations in two orthogonal planes by the same angle. Depending on if combining the orientations of the planes agrees with the orientation of the whole space or not, we can call them left isoclinic or right isoclinic rotations, because they correspond to multiplying quaternions (which form a 4-dimensional space) either on the left or on the right by unit quaternions. As such, the subgroups of left and right isoclinic rotations are both copies of S^3 within SO(4). Now my curiosity is in which planes are stable under an isoclinic rotation, or without loss of generality a one-parameter subgroup of them. Any 2D plane has a unique orthogonal complement, and to the two resulting planes we get a one-parameter subgroup, which can be identified with a line in the corresponding lie algbera so(3) of dimension 3. Therefore we have some map from the Grassmanian manifold of 2D planes to the projective plane. Characterizing stable planes of a given one-parameter group of isoclinic rotations is then equivalent to finding the fibers of this map, which should all be identical by symmetery. So we have some fiber bundle $$F\to \mathrm{Gr}(2,4)\to\mathbb{P}^2 $$ Is there a good explicit description of the fibers? Or just its isomorphism type? My initial thoughts: Given the fiber $F\subseteq\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$ of a point in $\mathbb{P}^2$ corresponding to some one-parameter subgroup $H$ of isoclinic rotations, if we have any point $x\in\mathbb{S}^3\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ the orbit $Hx$ is a circle in $\mathbb{S}^3$, which determines a plane $\pi$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and indeed $\pi\in F$. So we get a map $\mathbb{S}^3\to F$, and the fibers of this map should be the circles in $\mathbb{S}^3$ which intersect planes $\pi\in F$. Thus we have a fiber bundle $\mathbb{S}^1\to\mathbb{S}^3\to F$, which naively suggests to me $F\cong\mathbb{S}^2$ based on the Hopf fibration. Some folks in chat though suggested $F$ should be $\mathbb{P}^2$ or a couple disjoint copies of it. Also mentioned was the fact that $\widetilde{\mathrm{Gr}}(2,4)$, the oriented Grassmanian which is a double cover of the usual $\mathrm{Gr}(2,4)$, is $\cong \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$, although I don't know why or for sure how to use this.

1508769,Holomorphic Functional Calculus for the Square Root,"I'm working on a problem set, so I'm not looking for a solution, but just maybe a pointer on where I'm going wrong. I want to use the holomorphic functional calculus to determine the square root of the matrix $$T=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{bmatrix}.$$ The spectrum of this matrix is just $\{1\}$, so a convenient curve enclosing the spectrum is $\gamma(t)=2e^{it}$ for $t\in\left[-\pi,\pi\right)$. Now I know that for $f(z)$ holomorphic (at least on a region containing both the spectrum and $\gamma$), the operator $\hspace{20pt}f(T)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma f(\xi)(\xi I-T)^{-1}d\xi=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{-\pi}^\pi f(2e^{it})(\xi I-T)^{-1}\cdot 2ie^{it}dt$ is well-defined. When I then plug in a polynomial for $f$, I get the right answer. However, when I plug in the square root, which I'm taking to be $\sqrt{\gamma(t)}=\sqrt{2}e^{it/2}$ so that the branch cut is along the negative real axis, I get a nonsensical answer: $\hspace{20pt}\left(\frac{20+\sqrt{10}\pi-2\sqrt{10}\arctan\sqrt{10}}{5\sqrt{2}\pi},\frac{10\sqrt{2}+11\sqrt{5}\pi-22\sqrt{5}\arctan\sqrt{10}}{110\pi};0,\frac{20+\sqrt{10}\pi-2\sqrt{10}\arctan\sqrt{10}}{5\sqrt{2}\pi}\right).$ Of course I expect $\sqrt{T}=\begin{bmatrix}1&1/2\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$.

1508866,Infinite sequence of digits without consecutive repeating subsequenes,"Problem description: Suppose we use a set of digits $\{0,1,2\}$ to form a sequence, for example
\begin{equation}
120210120102012102010210120212010\cdots

The length can be finite or infinite. The sequence is invalid if there are two finite subsequences appears consecutively. For example, the following sequences are invalid

(a non-constructive proof is also acceptable; but a constructive one would be better.) One way to think about it: We can transform the sequence to a (base 3) real number, 
\begin{equation}
120\cdots \rightarrow 0.120\cdots

Then the only possible infinite sequence should be a irrational number. Irrational number has no period, which means the pattern will not repeat infinite many times, but may repeat finite many times. A famous example is the Feynman point , The Feynman point is a sequence of six 9s that begins at the 762nd
  decimal place of the decimal representation of $\pi$. So not all irrational number($\le 1$) are valid sequences. I use a short program to do enumeration, but it quickly falls in exponential growth of candidates. I failed to come up with a contraction. Generalization: Can we take a larger set like $\{0,1,2,3, \cdots, n\}$? Can we relax the constraint to be three consecutive repetition or more? Motivation This problem origins from threefold repetition rule in chess, In chess and some other abstract strategy games, the threefold
  repetition rule (also known as repetition of position) states that a
  player can claim a draw if the same position occurs three times, or
  will occur after their next move, with the same player to move. The
  repeated positions do not need to occur in succession. The idea behind
  the rule is that if the position occurs three times, no progress is
  being made. It reduces to the proposed problem if we modify the this rule to be ""the same position occurs two times with the same sequences of moves "". Thanks for your help.

1509100,Poisson Process - non-zero probability of more than one arrival,"Quoting Bertsekas' Introduction to Probability : An arrival process is called a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ if
  it has the following properties: a) Time homogenity - the probability $P(k,\tau)$ of $k$ arrivals is
  the same for all intervals of the same length $\tau$ b) The number of arrivals during a particular interval is independent
  of the history of arrivals outside this interval. c) Small interval probabilities - The probabilities $P(k,\tau)$
  satisfy: $P(0,\tau)=1-\lambda\tau + o(\tau)$ $P(1,\tau)=\lambda\tau + o_1(\tau)$ $P(k,\tau)=o_k(\tau)$ for $k=2,3,...$ Here, $o(\tau)$ and $o_k(\tau)$ are functions of $\tau$ that satisfy $\mathbb{lim}_{r\to0}\frac{o(\tau)}{\tau}=0$,
  $\mathbb{lim}_{r\to0}\frac{o_k(\tau)}{\tau}=0$ Then we are given the formula: $$P(k,\tau)=e^{-\lambda\tau}\frac{(\lambda\tau)^k}{k!}$$ Note that a Taylor series expansion of $e^{-\lambda\tau}$ yields: $P(0,\tau)=e^{-\lambda\tau}=1-\lambda\tau+o(\tau)$ $P(1,\tau)=\lambda\tau
 e^{-\lambda\tau}=\lambda\tau-\lambda^2\tau^2+O(\tau^3)=\lambda\tau+o_1(\tau)$. First of all, what are $o(\tau)$, $o_1(\tau)$ and $O(\tau)$ in the Taylor expansion? Does it have anything to do with Taylor expansion per se? I thought that $o$ is the little-o notation, but its definition is quite different - $ f(n) = o(g(n))$ if $g(n)$ grows much faster than $f(n)$. In this case, it's quite different. Then what is it? Secondly, the author doesn't prove that the $o$ terms above satisfy $\mathbb{lim}_{r\to0}\frac{o(\tau)}{\tau}=0$,
  $\mathbb{lim}_{r\to0}\frac{o_k(\tau)}{\tau}=0$ as stated in the definition of Poisson process. How can we prove it? Most importantly - why do we want it to satisfy the properties described in 'c) Small interval probabilities'? These 3 formulas are not arbitrary, there has to be a good reason for them. Ideally, if we let $\lambda \to 0$ and it's natural to expect that the probability $P(k,\tau)$ to equal exactly $0$ in the limit, but apparently it's not possible (there will always be that tiny number, $o_k(\tau)$).

this vector $B$. My question is : as negative values can be found in some $B$ vectors (like those used by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method )
it is possible that the final derivative will be negative whereas all values produced by f are positive, and vice versa . It seems that in some circumstances, the explicit Runge-Kutta methods including negative coefficients in their $B$ vector

Thanks to Anthony Carapetis , I know that: $$\iota_X(\alpha\wedge\beta)=(k+\ell)(\iota_X\alpha\wedge\beta+(-1)^k\alpha\wedge\iota_X\beta),$$ where $\alpha$ is a $k$-form and $\beta$ an $\ell$-form. Now I start on Cartan. I first suppose $\omega=d\alpha$ for $\alpha$ a $(k-1)$-form. Then: $$\mathcal{L}_Xd\alpha=d\mathcal{L}_X\alpha=d(d\iota_X\alpha+\iota_Xd\alpha)=d\iota_Xd\alpha=d\iota_X\omega,$$ and being $\omega$ exact, it is closed, so $\iota_Xd\omega=\iota_X0=0$. Now consider $f\omega$ for any smooth function $f$. $f$ will then be a 0-form. If I try induction, I get stuck with: $$\mathcal{L}_X(f\omega)=f\mathcal{L}_X\omega+\mathcal{L}_Xf\cdot\omega=fd\iota_X\omega+\iota_Xdf\cdot\omega,$$ whereas the RHS of Cartan would be: \begin{align*}
d\iota_X(f\omega)+\iota_Xd(f\omega)={}&d(kf\iota_X\omega)+\iota_X(df\wedge\omega)={} \\
{}={}&kdf\wedge\iota_X\omega+kfd\iota_X\omega+(k+1)\iota_Xdf\wedge\omega-(k+1)df\wedge\iota_X\omega,

Have I used the linked question too hastily to deduce a formula for the normalized wedge? Details Anthony proved, in his answer, that, if $\overline\wedge$ denotes the unnormalized antisimmetrization, then: $$\iota_X(\alpha\overline\wedge\beta)=k\iota_X\alpha\overline\wedge\beta+(-1)^k\ell\beta\overline\wedge\iota_X\beta.$$ The relationship between $\wedge$ and $\overline\wedge$ is that, if $\alpha$ is a $k$-form and $\beta$ an $\ell$-form: $$\alpha\wedge\beta=\frac{(k+\ell)!}{k!\ell!}\alpha\overline\wedge\beta.$$ The above identity then becomes: $$\iota_X\left(\frac{k!\ell!}{(k+\ell)!}\alpha\wedge\beta\right)=\frac{(k-1)!\ell!}{(k+\ell-1)!}k\iota_X\alpha\wedge\beta+(-1)^k\frac{k!(\ell-1)!}{(k+\ell-1)!}\ell\alpha\wedge\iota_X\beta,$$ which with due simplifications done after extracting the fraction from the parenthesis on the left yields: $$\frac{1}{k+\ell}\iota_X(\alpha\wedge\beta)=\iota_X\alpha\wedge\beta+(-1)^k\alpha\wedge\iota_X\beta,$$ which is almost identical to what I said at the start of the question after the link to my previous question.

1509545,If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables and $X$ is absolutely continuous then $X+Y$ is absolutely continuous,"I'm stuck in the following problem. Let $X$ and $Y$ independent random variable where $X$ is absolutely continuous. Then $X+Y$ is absolutely continuous. This is what I have so far. Let $(\Omega,\mathscr{F}, P)$ the probability space where $X$ and $Y$ are random variables. Let $Z=(X,Y)$ a random vector and let $g$ the sum function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}$, that is, $(x,y) \longmapsto x+y$, clearly $g$ is Borel measurable since it's continuous. Then $g\circ Z =X+Y$ is a random variable. Now since $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables, the law of $Z$ is the product measure of the law of $X$ and the law $Y$, that is, $P_Z =(P_X \times \,P_Y)$, where $P_Z=PZ^{-1}$ and $(P_X \times \,P_Y)$ is the product measure. Then for $A$ in $\mathscr{B} (\mathbb{R})$ we have \begin{align*}P_{X+Y}(A)=P_Z (g^{-1 }(A))&=(P_X \times\,P_Y)(g^{-1 }(A))\\
&=\int_{\mathbb{R}} P_Y(g^{-1}(A)_x) dP_X \tag{definition of prod. measure}\end{align*} Where $g^{-1}(A)_x= \{y\in \mathbb{R}:(x,y)\in g^{-1}(A)\}=\{y\in \mathbb{R}:x+y\in A\}$, that is, $g^{-1}(A)_x =A-x$. Now we know that $P_X<<\lambda$, since $P_X$ is finite, the Radon-Nikodym Thm (which we abbreviate as R-N), implies that there is a non-negative measurable funcion $f$, such that $P_X(B)= \int_B f d\lambda$ for any Borel set $B$. Then, by the chain rule for R-N we have \begin{align*} \int_{\mathbb{R}} P_Y(g^{-1}(A)_x) dP_X &= \int_{\mathbb{R}} P_Y(A-x) f (x)\, \lambda(dx)
\end{align*} and from here I'm stuck, I'd appreciate a hint to conclude. Thank you. Edit: Thus, \begin{align*} \int_{\mathbb{R}} P_Y(g^{-1}(A)_x) dP_X

At each stage, a ball is selected from either urn, and the selected balls are switched. Let $X_n$ denote the number of black balls in the first urn after the $n$th switch. Give (a) the transition probabilities, (b) find/guess the limiting probabilities of the chain without computation, and (c) actually compute the limiting probabilities and show that the chain is time reversible. Problem: I don't know how to reason through (b), and I can't find a simple form solution for (c). Attempt: I will first do part (a). Let $P$ be the transition matrix and $\pi$ the limiting probabilities vector. Then $$P_{ii}=2\left(\frac{i}{m}\right)\left(\frac{m-i}{m}\right)$$ Since we choose $i$ blacks from the first urn and $m-i$ blacks from the second, or vice versa regarding whites. $$P_{i,i+1}=\left(\frac{m-i}{m}\right)^2$$ Since we choose from the $m-i$ whites from the first urn and $m-i$ blacks from the second. Similarly, then, $$P_{i,i-1}=\left(\frac{i}{m}\right)^2$$ Noting that $P_{i,i-1}+P_{ii}+P_{i,i+1}=1$, all other entries in $P$ for each $i$ is $0$. Now I will solve (c). The chain is time reversible because for any states $i,j$, it's not possible to witness $i$ followed by $j$ twice without witnessing $j$ followed by $i$ someplace in between. Thus, we have $$\pi_iP_{i,i-1}=\pi_{i-1}P_{i-1,i}\Longrightarrow\pi_i=\pi_{i-1}\frac{P_{i-1,i}}{P_{i,i-1}}=\pi_{i-1}\left(\frac{m-i+1}{i}\right)^2$$ Then $$\pi_i=\pi_0\prod_{j=1}^i\left(\frac{m-j+1}{j}\right)^2$$ And $$\sum_{k=0}^m\pi_k=\pi_0\sum_{k=0}^m\prod_{j=1}^k\left(\frac{m-j+1}{j}\right)^2=1$$ Which gives me a very messy solution for $\pi_i$ for all $i$. Unfortunately, I can't think of any way to simplify this with the squared term, but for various reasons I suspect that the solution has a nice representation. Update: We have that $$\pi_0\sum_{k=0}^m\prod_{j=1}^k\left(\frac{m-j+1}{j}\right)^2=\pi_0\sum_{k=0}^m{m\choose k}^2=\pi_0\sum_{k=0}^m{m\choose k}{m\choose{m-k}}=\pi_0{{2m}\choose m}=1$$ Or $$\pi_0=\frac1{{2m}\choose m}$$ And $$\pi_i=\pi_0\prod_{j=1}^i\left(\frac{m-j+1}{j}\right)^2=\pi_0{m\choose i}^2=\pi_0{m\choose i}{m\choose{m-i}}=\frac{{m\choose i}{m\choose{m-i}}}{{2m}\choose m}$$","['probability', 'markov-chains', 'stochastic-processes']"

Hint: Consider dyadic intervals (i.e. intervals of the form $\left[j/2^k,(j+1)/2^k\right]$) first. Now this is in the context of a measure theory course. The only thing we have said about probabilities is that a probability is a measure $\mu$ on a space $(X,\mathcal A)$ that satisfies $\mu(X)=1$. Nothing else.

Well, I know that $[0,1]=\bigcup_{j=0}^{2^k-1}\big[j/2^k,(j+1)/2^k\big)$ for any $k$ and so the probability that any random $x$ is in one of the dyadic intervals is $1/2^k$.

  We now note that we have over-parameterized the problem: 
  if we scale w, b and $\delta$ by a constant factor $\alpha$,

  $f(x) = wx + b$ defines a discriminant function (so that the output is > $sgn(f(x))$), then
  the hyperplane $cwx + cb$ defines the same discriminant function for any $c > 0$. Thus we have the freedom to choose the scaling of $w$ so that $min_{x_i}

1510188,Spin^c structure induced by a spin structure,"I wondered how it works exactly to induce a $\mathrm{spin^c}$-structure if a spin structure is given. I wanted to use the following definitions as used in Friedrich`s ""Dirac operators in Riemannian Geometry"" Let $(Q,\pi_Q,M;\operatorname{SO}(n))$ be a $\operatorname{SO}(n)$-principle bundle on a manifold $M$. The maps $\lambda:\operatorname{Spin}(n)\to \operatorname{SO}(n)$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{c}:\mathrm{Spin^c}(n)\to \operatorname{SO}(n)$ below are the respective standard covering maps. The  horizontal arrows are the actions of the groups on the fibers. Definition A spin structure on $Q$ is a pair $(P,\varLambda)$ consisting of a $\operatorname{Spin}(n)$-principal bundle $(P,\pi_P,M;\operatorname{Spin}(n))$ such that $\varLambda:P\to Q$ is a $2$-fold covering bundle map for which the following diagram commutes Definition A $spin^c$ structure on $M$ is a pair $ (P^{\mathrm{c}},\varLambda_{\mathrm{c}})$ consisting of a $\mathrm{Spin^c}(n)$-principle bundle $(P^{\mathrm{c}},\pi_P,M;\mathrm{Spin^c}(n))$ over $M$ and a fiber map $\varLambda_{\mathrm{c}}:P\to Q$ such that the following diagram commutes: Now a typical assertion is that each spin structure induces a canonical $\mathrm{spin^c}$ structure. I tried to show that via connecting the commutative diagrams, and using the fact that there is a natural inclusion of the spin group in the $\mathrm{spin^c}$ group.

1510275,"Differentiability of $f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2), f(0) = 0$ [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : How do you show that $e^{-1/x^2}$ is differentiable at $0$? (4 answers) Closed 8 years ago . Let $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by $f(x) = \exp(-1/x^2)$ if $x\neq 0$ and $f(0)=0$. I'm trying to show that $f$ is differentiable with continuous derivative in all points $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Now, if $x\neq 0$ then $f(x) = \exp \circ g(x)$ being $g(x)=-1/x^2$. In that case, the chain rule can be used to see that $f$ is differentiable with derivative $$f'(x) = \exp(g(x))g'(x) =\exp \left(\dfrac{-1}{x^2}\right)\dfrac{2}{x^3},$$ which clearly is continuous, since $\exp$ is continuous, $g$ is continuous and $g'$ is continuous on these points. Now, when $x=0$ I don't really know what to do. By the definition I think it is not a good way, since we have $$f'(0)=\lim_{x\to 0}\dfrac{\exp\left(\frac{-1}{x^2}\right)}{x}$$ and I'm unsure on how to proceed. Of course I could write $\exp$ as a series, but I don't know how to rigorously justify the manipulations that follows. So how to show that this function is differentiable with continuous derivative? EDIT: As pointed out in comments, if we set $h(t)=te^{-t^2}$ and $q(x)=\exp\left(\frac{-1}{x^2}\right)/x$ then if $s(x)=1/x$ we have $$q(x)=h(s(x)).$$ Then it is intuitively clear that $$\lim_{x\to 0^+}q(x)=\lim_{t\to \infty}h(t).$$ Now how to prove this rigorously? This change of variables involves one limit at infinity, and I'm unsure how to justify this.","['calculus', 'real-analysis', 'limits', 'derivatives']"

Prove that $f$ is continuous in $E$. So if $\textbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n)$ and $\textbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, y_3, ... , y_n)$, then we have to show that for all $\epsilon >0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that $d(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y}) < \delta \implies d(f(\textbf{x}), f(\textbf{y})) < \epsilon$. I am reading a solution here and it says we can write $f(x_1 + h_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) - f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n)$ as: $f(x_1 + h_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) - f(x_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) + f(x_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) - f(x_1, x_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) + \ldots + f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... ,x_n + h_n) - f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n)$ and then use the mean value theorem to get: $D_1(x_1 + h_1t_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n)h_1$ + $D_2(x_1, x_2 + h_2t_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n)h_2 + \ldots D_n(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... ,x_n + h_nt_n)h_n$ Since each $D_n$ is bounded, take the maximum of these bounds, call it $M$. Then we have that the expression directly above this sentence is $\leq M(|h_1| + |h_2| + \ldots + |h_n|)$, so: $f(x_1 + h_1, x_2 + h_2, x_3 + h_3, ... , x_n + h_n) - f(x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n) \leq M(|h_1| + |h_2| + \ldots + |h_n|)$ Then the proof just stops there and doesn't continue. I don't understand what the $h_n$'s are supposed to represent. Are they real numbers? If so, why are we adding an arbitrary vector $\textbf{h}$ to $\textbf{x}$?

Ideally, it would look something like

for some constants $K$ and $C$, although I'm thinking this isn't true; I'm also not sure how to incorporate $n$ here into $K$ or $C$. It's important that the bound quantifies the deviation in terms of $p$, so that I have good control over what is going on as $p \to 0$. The furthest I've gotten is that, by iterated expectation and the usual Gaussian concentration stuff,
\begin{align}
P\left(\sum_i \epsilon_i X_i > t\right)
\le E\left\{\exp\left(\frac{-t^2 n}{2\sigma^2 \sum_i \epsilon_i}\right)\right\} \tag{2}

\limsup_n P\left(\sum_i \epsilon_i X_i > t\right)
\le \exp\left(\frac{-t^2}{2\sigma^2 p}\right)

by the law of large numbers. But this approach doesn't seem strong enough, since a little bit of numeric investigation shows that (2) is quite a bit worse than (1) as $p \to 0$. Some quantification of how $p$ and $n$ play into the bound (2) would also be good.","['probability-theory', 'concentration-of-measure', 'probability']"
