2109624,Need input on results for propositional logic problem,"I am not currently in university, but I am going through a discrete mathematics text book from when I was in university. In the text book examples, there was a problem that I looked through and I thought it would be good to apply a truth table to it. I am unsure about my answer, so please let me know if I got something wrong. Here is the statement which I'm using to create the truth table. 'You cannot ride the roller coaster if you are under four feet tall unless your are older then 16 years old.' If we break this down, we get the propositional variables q(You can ride the roller coaster), r(You are under four feet tall) and s(You are older than sixteen years old). We can use these to create the propositional statement (r ^ ¬s) ⇒ ¬q Here is the truth table I have formulated. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
r & s & (r \land ¬s) & ¬q & (r \land ¬s) \rightarrow \neg q   \\ 
\hline
T & T &    T     &  T &       T         \\
T & F &    F     &  F &       T         \\
F & T &    F     &  T &       T         \\
F & F &    F     &  F &       T         \\
\hline
\end{array} After looking through this truth table, I noticed that there was a missing condition in the final conditional statement, specifically, if (r ^ ¬s) is T and ¬q is F. Therefore, I created a new truth table as seen below. \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 (r \land ¬s) & \neg q & (r \land ¬s) \rightarrow ¬q \\ 
\hline 
    T     & T  &       T       \\  
    F     & T  &       T       \\ 
    T     & F  &       F       \\ 
    F     & F  &       T       \\
\hline
\end{array} Thoughts? The book did not ask for a truth table, but I thought I would write one out anyway. Are there any corrections that should be made?","['logic', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2109655,Intuition behind why the expected time of first return is infinite for symmetric random walk?,"The generating function is $F_0(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_0(n)s^n$. $f_0(n)$ is the probability of ""first"" return after n steps. If the particle is certain to return to origin, i.e. $F_0(1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}f_0(n) = 1$ So the expected time is infinity. $F_0^{'}(1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}nf_0(n) = \infty$ However, I lack the intuition why it is infinity but not finite number.

This includes both zip codes that correspond to an actual city, town, incorporated community, ghost town, etc. in the United States and zip codes that are not used currently.

2110195,About a refined Burnside's theorem in prime characteristic.,"The following result is due to W. Burnside: Theorem. Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\textrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. If $G$ has finite exponent, then $G$ is finite. The proof relies on the following: Lemma. Let $A\in\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ such that for all $k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, $\textrm{tr}(A^k)=0$, then $A$ is nilpotent. It is not hard to see that the theorem still holds over fields of characteristic zero. Indeed, to establish the lemma it suffices to consider a splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of $A$. However, the theorem fails to be true over infinite field of prime characteristic; consider the following subgroup of $\textrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p(t))$:
$$G:=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}1&f\\0&1\end{pmatrix};f\in\mathbb{F}_p(t)\right\}.$$
Notice that $G$ is infinite albeit having exponent $p$. My conjecture is that the following refinement is true: Conjecture. Let $k$ be an infinite field of prime characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a subgroup of $\textrm{GL}_n(k)$. If the exponent of $G$ is finite and prime with $p$, then $G$ is finite. I already proved the conjecture for $n<p$, in that precise case it is not hard to see that the lemma still holds. However, for $n\geqslant p$, the lemma is false. For example, consider $p=2$, $n=2$ and $A=I_2$. Any enlightenment and/or references will be greatly appreciated!","['matrices', 'positive-characteristic', 'group-theory']"

Then $\forall r>0$ small enough $f(B(x_0,r))$ doesn't contain a ball around $f(x_0)$. My attempt is the following: Since $f$ is onto its image $\operatorname{Img}(f) \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ of degree at most $k$. Since $\operatorname{rank}Df(x_0) = k$, around $x_0$ the image of $f$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ which is of dimension $k$. That is, around $x_0$ $f$ is injective (by the inverse function theorem). The inverse function theorem applies for functions from $\mathbb{R}^k$ to itself, is this a legitimate use of this theorem, thinking of the image as a $k$ dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$? If so how do we show this? Letting $U$ be the environment in which $f$ is injective, we take $r>0$ so that $B(x_0,r) \subset U$. If $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t $B(f(x_0),\delta) \subset f(B(x_0,r))$ then since $\dim(B(f(x_0),\delta)) = m$ we get $m \leq k$, in contradiction.

If $\kappa=0$ is the curvature of $\gamma$, then $\gamma(s)$ is a straight line. Now I proceeded to use the first Serret-Frenet equation $\mathbf t'=\kappa \mathbf n$ which gives us $\mathbf t'=\mathbf 0$, in other words, $\mathbf t$ is a constant vector. Clearly if a curve has a constant tangent vector, then it must be a straight line. When I looked up my lecturer's proof, he proved it similarly but performed an additional step: Now $$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d s}(\mathbf r\times\mathbf t)=\mathbf t\times\mathbf t+\mathbf r\times\mathbf t'=\mathbf 0,$$ so $\mathbf r\times\mathbf t$ is also a constant vector, i.e. $\mathbf r\times\mathbf t=\mathbf a$ where $\mathbf a$ is some constant vector. This corresponds to the equation of a straight line. It is this step which I do not understand. How does this correspond to the equation of a straight line?

Proof: (my attempt) If $\bar A$ is a closed set then that implies that it contains all its limit points. So suppose to the contrary that $\bar A$ is not a  closed set. Then $\exists$ a limit point $p$ of $\bar A$ such that $p\not \in \bar A.$ Clearly, $p$ is not a limit point of $A$ because if it were then $p\in \bar A$ . This means that $\exists$ a neighborhood $N_r(p)$ which does not contain any point of $A$ . But $p$ is a limit point of $\bar A$ so it must contain an element $y\in \bar A-A$ in its neighborhood $N_r(p).$ Of course, $y$ is a limit point. Now, $0<d(p,y)=h<r.$ If we choose $0<\epsilon<r-h$ , then $N_{\epsilon}(y)$ will contain no point $x\in A$ , which is a contradiction since $y$ is a limit point.

Where do you end up walking? It's very easy to see that you end up walking on the perimeter of the same square, with side equal to $1$ step (every $4$ steps you are back at the point where you started), if you are walking on a plane . But what happens if you walk on the surface of a sphere? The answer obviously depends on how long is your step in relationship to the sphere's radius $R$. If your step length is $\pi R$, for example, you end up walking back and forth over the same lune, formed by two half circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. If your step length is $\pi R/2$, you end up walking on a triangle, formed by quarter circumferences at $90$ degrees angle. I believe one can prove the following: a) For any $x\geq 0$ and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, there is a step length $y\in(x,x+\epsilon)$ such that the process above takes you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps. b) No step length that brings you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps is a rational multiple of the length of the circumference, $2\pi R$, except for integer multiples of $\pi R/2$ (which keep you cycling over the same $1$,$2$, or $3$ points). c) Any step length that does not bring you back to the starting point in a finite number of steps eventually brings you all over the surface of the sphere, in the sense that for any point $P$ on the sphere's surface and any arbitrarily small $\epsilon>0$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$. In fact, for any point $P$ and any angle $\alpha$, you eventually end up within distance $\epsilon$ of $P$ and with an angle between $\alpha$ and $\alpha+\epsilon$ of your starting direction (measured as the angle between the respective great circles)!

Fair enough, but an inner product is a pretty specific structure on a space. Do we need it to define what self-adjoint means?

Unfortunately, formal measures, which assigns a weight for each singleton $\left\{x\right\}$ in $T_p$, $$\mu(T_p)=\sum_{x \in T_p}\mu(\left\{x\right\})$$ would not be meaningful since assigning zero or positive weight would give subsets of $\mathbb{Q}$ zero or infinite measure.

What does it mean to equip the set $\mathcal{M}$ of probability measures on this space with the weak*-star topology?

2111332,Question on Notation from Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds,"In Spivak's book Calculus on Manifolds, he uses some notation that I'm not entirely sure of. On pg 20 when discussing the derivative of a function $p:R^2 \rightarrow R$ and $p(x,y) = x \cdot y$, he writes $$
Dp(a,b)(x,y) = bx + ay
$$ and concludes that $p'(a,b) = (b,a)$. This is where I am a little confused. At one point, he states that $Dp(a,b)$ represents the derivative of $p$ at the point $(a,b)$ (pg 16). He goes on to say that it's common to represent the derivative in this case as the Jacobian, which would be a $1x2$ matrix in this case, as indicated by $p'(a,b) = (b,a)$ (I mean, it's not exactly a matrix, but the point is there). However, when defining $Dp(a,b)(x,y)$, what returns is a scalar value. So I'm not sure how to interpret this. In exercise 2-12 (pg 23), he asks us to show for a bilinear function $f:R^n \times R^m \rightarrow R^p$ that $Df(a,b)(x,y) = f(a,y) + f(x,b)$. Well, now here, the derivative is in $R^p$, so clearly not a scalar. How am I supposed to interpret this? If it is at the point $(a,b)$, then why are both $x$ and $y$ present on the right hand side? What is being expressed in this case?","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'multivariable-calculus', 'manifolds']"

If $(x,y)=(0,0)$ then $f$ is equal to zero. My problem is to prove that this function isn't differentiable at the point $(0,0)$. My solution: First idea is maybe to show that $f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$. That will show that $f$ isn't differentiable at $(0,0)$. But it is easy to see that $f$ is continuous at $(0,0)$, so we need to check the partial derivatives at $(0,0)$. Partial derivative in $x$-direction is
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h,0)-0}{h}=0$$ Partial derivative in $y$-direction is $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(0,h)-0}{h}=-1$$
We now know how our Jacobian matrix at the point $(0,0)$ looks. We now use the definition of derivatives:
$$\lim_{(x,y)\rightarrow(0,0)}\frac{\frac{x^4-y^3}{x^2+y^2}+y}{\sqrt{(x^2+y^2)}}=\frac{x^4+x^2y}{(x^2+y^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}$$

The gambler starts with a fortune of $M$ and will continue playing until they either go broke (fortune reaches 0) or reach their target of $T$ dollars. $P_1(k)$ does not change, i.e. the gambler does not adapt their strategy. Denote this game by $G_1$. Let there be a second game with same starting fortune and same target, but with a different distribution over winnings. Specifically let $k_0\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $P_2(k)$ be given by $P_2(0)=\sum_{k=-k_0+1}^{k_0-1}P_1(k)$ $P_2(k_0)=\sum_{k\geq k_0}P_1(k)$ $P_2(-k_0)=\sum_{k\leq -k_0}P_1(k)$ $P_2(k)=0$ otherwise Denote this game by $G_2$. I am not interested in probabilities of ruin or reaching the target, just in the duration. Claims: The duration of $G_1$ is shorter than $G_2$. The probability that the game is still going after $N$ steps is always larger for $G_2$ than for $G_1$. The second claim would imply the first. I am happy to assume $T=2M$ if this makes the problem easier. Intuitively I believe this to be true: I am basically shortening the stepsizes so I'd expect the game to last longer.

2111662,Prove compact subsets of metric spaces are closed,"Prove compact subsets of metric spaces are closed Note, this question is more of analyzing an incorrect proof of mine rather than supplying a correct proof. My Attempted Proof Suppose $X$ is a metric space. Let $A \subset X$ be a compact subset of $X$ and let $\{V_{\alpha}\}$ be an open cover of $A$. Then there are finitely many indices $\alpha_{i}$ such that $A \subset V_{\alpha_{1}} \cup \ ... \ \cup V_{\alpha_{n}}$. Now let $x$ be a limit point of $A$. Assume $x \not\in A$. If $x \not\in A$ put $\delta = \inf \ \{\ d(x, y) \  | \ y \in A\}$. Take $\epsilon = \frac{\delta}{2}$, then $B_d(x, \epsilon) \cap A = \emptyset$ so that a neighbourhood of $x$ does not intersect $A$ asserting that $x$ cannot be a limit point of $A$, hence $x \in A$ so that $A$ is closed. $\square$. Now there must be something critically wrong in my proof, as I don't even use the condition that $A$ is compact anywhere in the contradiction that I establish. The above proof would assert that every subset of a metric space is closed . I think my error must be in the following argument : $\delta = \inf \ \{\ d(x, y) \  | \ y \in A\}$. For if we take $X = \mathbb{R}$ and $A = (0, 1) \subset \mathbb{R}$, then $\delta = 0$ if $x = 1$ or $x = 0$.

2111685,Probability of double matchings,"Yesterday, I solved this problem question from probability theory: Two similar decks of $N$ distinct cards are matched against a similar target deck. Find the probability of exactly $m \leq N$ matches. I proceeded in the following manner. Let $A_i$ denote the event that $i^{\text{th}}$ card is matched (from both the decks) against the target deck. Therefore, let $$P(\text{E = exactly $m$ match occurs})(N,m)$$ (don't mind the bad notation please) then $$P(N,m) = S_m - \binom{m+1}{m}S_{m+1} + \binom{m+2}{m}S_{m+2} + \ldots + \binom{N}{m} S_{N}$$ where $S_1 = \sum_{1\leq i \leq N} P(A_i)$, $S_2 = \sum_{1\leq i \lt j \leq N} P(A_i \cap A_j) \ldots$ Clearly, we have $$S_{m+k} = \binom{N}{m+k} \frac{(N-m-k)!^2}{N!^2}$$
Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
P(N,m) &= \sum_{k=0}^{N-m} (-1)^k \binom{m+k}{m} \binom{N}{m+k} \frac{(N-m-k)!^2}{N!^2} \\ 
&= \frac{1}{m!} \frac{1}{N!} \sum_{k=0}^{N-m} (-1)^k \frac{(N-m-k)!}{k!}
\end{align*} After obtaining the above expression, I thought if there exists some nice closed formula for the series. So I plugged it on W|A but it doesn't returns one (in terms of elementary functions). Next, I started wondering, how does this probability function behaves as $N \rightarrow \infty$. Because this limit might be actual translation of some real world phenomena (although that is something to be considered about, later on). So, I first tried to check for $m=0$ \begin{align*}
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} P(N,0) &= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{N!} \sum_{k=0}^{N} (-1)^k \frac{(N-k)!}{k!} \\
&= \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{N} + \frac{1}{2!}\frac{1}{N(N-1)} - \ldots \right)
\end{align*} It doesn't strikes me on how to solve this limit, as I cannot evaluate the limit pointwise since it is an infinite sum. So I thought of setting up a recurrence (which may help?). This is what I found: $$P(N+2,0) = P(N+1,0) + \frac{P(N,0)}{(N+1)(N+2)} + \frac{(-1)^{N}}{(N+2)!^2}$$ But again, I still couldn't figure out much. I even expressed this as an integral (just because sometimes, it does help) and then tried to do some manipulations, but still no clue $$P(N,0) = (N+1) \int_0^1 \sum_{k=0}^N\frac{ t^k(1-t)^{N-k}}{k!^2} \mathrm{d}t$$ So these are the questions, I am trying to find a solution to: Is there any nice closed form for the expression? How does the probability function, which I derived, behaves when $N \rightarrow \infty$ for a fixed $m$? What happens as $N \rightarrow \infty$ and $m \rightarrow \infty$?

2111882,The permutations of the components of the vectors in N-dimensional space are mutually perpendicular,"Find the maximum numbers of component of vectors of a given $n$ dimensions such that they are perpendicular to each other. The condition is that the component in each vector has to be a permutation of of the original one The original vectors: $e_1=(x_1, x_2......x_n)$ all the permutations: $e_2=(x_9, -x_2......x_n)$ , $e_3=(-x_4, x_{12}......-x_n)$ ...... For example, vectors $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ , $(-x_2,x_1,-x_4,x_3)$ and $(x_3,x_4,-x_1,-x_2)$ are mutually perpendicular when $n$ = $4$ When $n$ is odd , all the vectors formed by the permutation of the component of the vector are impossible to be mutually perpendicular , but I don't know the proof . When $n$ is even, there are definitely many vectors which formed by the permutation of the components of the original vectors are mutually perpendicular .What's the pattern of the perpendicular? I tried myself and find that the vectors of different combinations of $+$ and $-$ signs are always mutually perpendicular when $n$ is even .But I can't prove it. With enumeration, it's easy to find the pattern, but where is the proof .","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'linear-algebra', 'closed-form']"
2111887,Is the shortest distance between two points in Euclidean $n$-space always a straight line?,"This question is related to these two questions [1] and [2] . Here is my question: Is the shortest distance between two points in Euclidean $n$-space always a straight line? In two dimensions, the answer is YES (?).  I am unsure how to answer the same question for the case of dimension $d \geq 3$. Added January 24 2017 For the case of Euclidean $n$-space (i.e., $\mathbb{R}^n$), the shortest distance between two points is indeed a straight line for the case $n=2$, a result which is obtained by considering the distance formula (which is an example of what we call a metric ) for the length of the line segment $\overline{{P_1}{P_2}}$: $$d(P_1, P_2) = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$ where the point $P_1$ has coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and the point $P_2$ has coordinates $(x_2, y_2)$. I am unsure of how to answer my question for the case of Euclidean $n$-spaces, for dimension $n \geq 3$. Added Further That is, given any two arbitrary points $A, B \in {\mathbb{R}}^n$, is the length of the line segment $\overline{AB}$ the shortest distance between $A$ and $B$? I came across the term geodesic in Wikipedia, but I do not know if it is applicable to this question.","['euclidean-geometry', 'soft-question', 'geometry']"
