I want to perform derivative of $F(x,w)$ with respect to $w$. Could you see my answer and give me some suggestion that Is it correct?
$$\frac {\partial F(x,w)}{\partial w}=?$$ That is what I done we see that $w^TA(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_ia_i$, then $$\frac {\partial (w^TA)}{\partial w_i}=ai$$ For $i=1$ to $M$, hence 
$$\frac {\partial (w^TA)}{\partial w}=A$$ Hence, 
$$\frac {\partial F(w,x)}{\partial w}=-2\sum_{i=1}^{N}\int_{x \in \Omega} \left ( Y(x)-w^TA(x)\right)u_i(x)\frac {\partial (w^TA)}{\partial w}dx$$

1385325,"If $(a_n)$ is increasing and $a_n^{1/c^n}\to\infty$, then $\sum\frac1{a_n}$ is irrational?","I $\DeclareMathOperator\lcm{lcm}$am trying to generalise the result from this question: If $(a_n)$ is increasing and $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n^{1/2^n} = \infty$, show that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} 1/{a_n}$ is irrational and I try to prove that Conjecture (strong). If $(a_n)$ is an increasing natural sequence and $c>1$ such that $a_n^{1/c^n}\to\infty$, then $\sum\frac1{a_n}$ is irrational. (Note that for $c\geq2$ we are done already.) Though I will also be happy if I only manage to prove that Conjecture (weak). If $(a_n)$ is an increasing natural sequence such that $a_n^{1/c^n}\to\infty$ for all $1<c<2$, then $\sum\frac1{a_n}$ is irrational. In particular I am wondering whether $\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac1{2^{2^n}+1}$ is irrational. (just curiosity) I'll summarize the proof in the linked question: It suffices to prove that
$$\liminf_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{\lcm(a_1,\ldots,a_k)}{a_n}=0;$$
we'll prove that in fact
$$\liminf_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_1\cdots a_k}{a_n}=0.$$
Let $a_n=b_n^{2^n}$ (so $b_n\to\infty$) and let $r$ be such that $b_n\leq b_r$ for all $n\leq r$. Then
$$\frac{a_1\cdots a_{r-1}}{a_{r+n}}=\frac{b_1^2\cdots b_{r-1}^{2^{r-1}}}{b_{r+n}^{2^{r+n}}}\leq\frac{b_r^{2+\cdots+2^{r-1}}}{b_{r+n}^{2^{r+n}}}\leq b_{r+n}^{2^n(2^r-2)-2^{r+n}}=b_{r+n}^{-2^{n+1}}.$$
Now choose $r$ such that $b_n\geq M>1$ for all $n\geq r$ and we get
$$\sum_{n=r}^\infty\frac{a_1\cdots a_{r-1}}{a_n}\leq\sum_{n=0}^\infty M^{-2^{n+1}}\leq\sum_{n=0}^\infty M^{-(n+1)}=\frac1M.$$
Because $M>1$ was arbitrary, we get
$$\liminf_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{\lcm(a_1,\ldots,a_k)}{a_n}=0.$$ It's not hard to see that this strategy (proving $\liminf_{k\to\infty}\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{\lcm(a_1,\ldots,a_k)}{a_n}=0$) does not work for $c<2$. For example for $a_n=2^{2^n}+1$ we have $\lcm(a_0,\ldots,a_k)=a_1\cdots a_k=2^{2^{k+1}}-1\approx a_{k+1}^2$ so even controlling the size of the first term is hopeless. What else can we do? Note: using the same strategy as in the linked question I was able to control the terms of $\sum_{n=k+1}^\infty\frac{a_1\cdots a_k}{a_n}$ (for suitable $k$) except the first $l-1$, where $l$ is such that $c^l\geq c^{l-1}+1$. I'm not mentioning the proof here because controlling the first $l-1$ terms seems hopeless anyway.","['conjectures', 'sequences-and-series', 'number-theory', 'rationality-testing']"

1385463,Troubling questions about probability,"Suppose we have some random phenomena. Is it true that any event concerning the phenomena has a fixed ""correct"" probability? That is, the correct probability is the relative number of occurrences of the event if the phenomena is repeated infinitely many times. If that's the case, is it provable that the modern theory of probability will always compute this correct probability for any event? Let us just take the discrete probability space for now. Suppose we construct an arbitrary sample space, with intrinsic probability values for outcomes that are indeed the ""correct"" probability values in reality. These probabilities sum to unity. Suppose that through our various probability laws, we arrive at a theoretical probability for a more complicated event. Is it always the case that this theoretical probability coincides with the true probability? Now, since each event has a ""correct probability"", given any sample space, we can assign intrinsic probability values that are necessarily ""correct"" in reality. The problem is that there can be multiple sample spaces. For instance, suppose we roll a 6-sided die. We can model the sample space as $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ or as $\{\text{roll is odd}, 2, 4, 6\}$. We can roll the die infinitely many times and hence assign intrinsic probabilities of $\frac{1}{6}$ to each outcome of the former sample space and $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{6}$ to each outcome of the latter respectively. The question is, will each such sample space (with probabilities assigned ""correctly"" in accordance with reality) lead us to the same final theoretical (and hence correct) probabilities? Can we prove that any sample space leads us to the same result? For instance, consider the probability $P(\text{roll is 2}|\text{roll is odd or roll is 2})$. Through probability theory, we compute it is as $\frac{1}{6} \div (\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{1}{4}$ in the former probability space and as $\frac{1}{6} \div (\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6})=\frac{1}{4}$ in the latter. This clearly coincides, but will it work for any possible thinkable sample space (there are infinitely many)? Is this fact provable with mathematics? Sorry about the long question, but in short, I would mainly like to find the answers for the bolded questions. If any of my assertions above are wrong, what exactly is provable with mathematics with regard to probability? It would be great if someone can enlighten me on these issues!","['probability-theory', 'provability', 'philosophy', 'probability', 'advice']"
1385476,How to define the operation of division apart from the inverse of multiplication?,"Sorry if this question is too far out there, but I'm looking for a rigorous definition of the division operation.  As I have seen it before, $a/b$ is the solution to the equation $a=xb$.  While I am okay with this sort of defintion, it is tantamount to saying that division is the inverse operation of multiplication.  (at least that's how I see it, comments on this assertion are welcome.) Instead, what I seek is a different sort of formalization of the definition of division of real numbers.  Whereas the definition above is nearly equivalent to defining division as the inverse operation of multiplication (again, maybe i'm wrong), I seek a definition that does not rely on the definition of multiplication already being asserted. Motivation :  Consider the fundamental theorem of calculus that essentially states that the indefinite integral is the inverse of the derivative.  This is a highly non-trivial theorem, and while one may be able to define the indefinite integral as the inverse of the derivative (could be wrong here as well), it is much more meaningful to define the two operations separately and then show that they're actually just inverses of one another.  Does anything like this exist for multiplication and division?  Or are these operations just too fundamental? Question :   Does there exist a definition for $a/b$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ that does not require multiplication to already be defined? I know, I'm grasping at straws, but maybe there is something here that really enhances my understanding of what division is in general.  Or maybe there are some interesting definitions involving limits or something that I have never seen before.","['abstract-algebra', 'real-numbers', 'soft-question']"

But I dont know a simple way to define a vector without give his components with respect to some basis. The situation seems different in an infinite dimensional vector space, as a space of function. In this case ve can define a vector as a function that satisfies some conditions ( e.g. n $L^2$ function), and this does not require a basis, so, doing this, we have e definition of the vector (function) that does depend from a basis.
If we want, we can now use a basis and define the components of the given function as coefficients of a series development ( a generalized Fourier expansion) and these coefficients are the analogous of the components of a vector in a finite dimensional space.

If one attacks the problem this way, the problem is in showing that the $L^2$-orthogonal projection from $S_e$ to $\bar X$ is well defined (actually maps Schwartz functions to Schwartz functions).

1385728,System of Differential Equations- Asymmetric First-Price Auction,"I am working on a problem in my Auction Theory textbook regarding a two-player asymmetric first price auction. Assume the bidders are risk neutral. The problem statement is as follows: Suppose that bidder $1$'s value $X_{1}$ is distributed according to $F_{1}(x) = \frac{1}{4}(x-1)^{2}$ over $[1, 3]$, and bidder $2$'s value is distributed according to $\text{exp}(\frac{2}{3}x - 2)$ over $[0, 3]$. Show that $\beta_{1}(x) = x - 1$ and $\beta_{2}(x) = \frac{2}{3}x$ constitute equilibrium bidding strategies in a first price auction. I am trying to work on deriving $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$. Unfortunately, my knowledge of differential equations isn't terribly strong. Would someone be able to double check my work and let me know if I have logic errors? I have derived the correct bidding functions, but am not entirely confident my work is sound. First, suppose the equilibrium bidding functions $\beta_{1} : [1, 3] \to \mathbb{R}_{+}, \beta_{2} : [0, 3] \to \mathbb{R}_{+}$ are strictly increasing and differentiable. Define $g_{1}(x) = \beta_{1}^{-1}(x)$ and $g_{2}(x) = \beta_{2}^{-1}(x)$. Player $i$ with valuation $v$ can only vary his bid, so he seeks to find the optimal bid given by the optimization problem below. $$\max_{b} F_{-i}(g_{-i}(b)) \cdot (v - b)$$ We consider the First Order Conditions: $$F_{-i}(g_{-i}(b)) = \dfrac{f_{-i}(g_{-i}(b))}{\beta_{-i}^{\prime}(g_{-i}(b))} \cdot (v-b)$$ At equilibrium, $v = g_{i}(b)$. Applying this and noting $\dfrac{1}{\beta_{-i}^{\prime}(g_{-i}(b))} = (g_{-i}(b))^{\prime}$, we have: $$(g_{-i}(b))^{\prime} = \dfrac{F_{-i}(g_{-i}(b))}{f_{-i}(g_{-i}(b))} \cdot \dfrac{1}{g_{i}(b) - b}$$ Plugging in each $F_{i}$, we obtain: $$g_{2}^{\prime}(b) = \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{g_{1}(b) - b}$$ And: $$g_{1}^{\prime}(b) = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \dfrac{g_{1}(b) - 1}{g_{2}(b) - b}$$ At equilibrium, we have $\beta_{1}(3) = \beta_{2}(3)$. By individual rationality, $\beta_{2}(0) = 0 \implies g_{2}(0) = 0$. While I could obviously use the problem statement that $\beta_{1}(x) = x - 1$ to conclude that $g_{1}(0) = 1$, I don't know how to justify this boundary condition independently. Does anyone have any insights into this? Assuming this boundary condition though, I note: $$g_{2}^{\prime}(0) = \dfrac{3}{2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{1 - 0} = \dfrac{3}{2}$$ From here, I can wave my hand and guess that $g_{2}^{\prime}(b) = \dfrac{3}{2}$, which would imply $g_{2}(b) = \dfrac{3}{2}b$. I'm not sure how to formally derive this though. Would anyone have insights into this? Once I have $g_{2}(b) = \dfrac{3}{2}b$, I can plug into $g_{1}^{\prime}(b)$ to get: $$g_{1}^{\prime}(b) = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \dfrac{g_{1}(b) - 1}{\dfrac{3}{2}b - b} = \dfrac{g_{1}(b) - 1}{b}$$ Which is a first order linear differential equation, whose solution is: $g_{1}(b) = b + 1 \implies \beta_{1}(v) = v - 1$. And we have $\beta_{2}(v) = \dfrac{2}{3}v$. My work is certainly a little hand-wavy. I would greatly appreciate any help in solidifying the details.

1385730,Constructing a metric for the tautological line bundle of $\mathbb C P^2$,"I'm doing some independent reading in differential geometry, and the following is my attempt to work out the details of the construction of the tautological bundle on $\mathbb CP^2$ and the induced metric. I'm posting this as a sort of sanity check. Any corrections or nitpicks are very welcome. Let me first consider $CP^2$ with the standard charts, just to fix notation. That is , $U_2=\{[x:y:z] : z\neq 0\}$ with the map $\phi_0([x:y:z])=(x/z, y/z)$ and similarly for $U_0$ and $U_1$. The transition map from $U_2$ to $U_1$, for example, is 
$(x,y) \rightarrow [x:y:1]\rightarrow (x/y, 1/y)$. We let $E\subset \mathbb CP^2 \times \mathbb C^3$ be the set of points $([s], ws)$ with $s$ nonzero and $w\in \mathbb C$. I claim this is a line bundle. It suffices to give trivializations and transition functions. Over $U_2$, we give $([x:y:z], w(x,y,z))\rightarrow (x/y, y/z, w)$ and similarly for the other $U_i$. Let us compute the transition function from part of the bundle over $U_2$ to the part over $U_1$. $$(x,y, t)\rightarrow ([x:y:1], t(x,y,1))=([x/y:1:1/y], ty(x/y,1,1/y))\rightarrow (x/y, 1/y, ty)$$
We get similar transitions for the other two intersections. If $([z], tz)$ and $([z], sz)$ are two elements of the tangent space over $[z]$, we can introduce the metric $\langle tz,sz\rangle $, where the brackets indicate the standard Hermitian metric on $\mathbb C^3$. In coordinates over $U_2$, we look at the points $(x,y,t)$ and $(x,y,s)$ and define the inner product here to be $\langle t(x,y,1), s(x,y,1)\rangle$. Is there anything else I should be checking here?","['riemannian-geometry', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

Why is it that proving that the integral is $0$ for all Borel measurable sets guarantees it is true for all Lebesgue measurable sets? Am I missing something vital about the relationship between Lebesgue measurable sets and Borel measurable sets? Statement: Let $m$ be Lebesgue measure and $a \in\mathbb R$ . Suppose that $f : \mathbb R \to\mathbb R$ is integrable, and $\int_a^xf(y) \, dy = 0$ for all $x$ . Then $f = 0$ a.e. Proof: We prove the conclusion first for intervals, then for unions of intervals, then for open sets, then for Borel measurable sets. For any interval $(c,d)$ , we have $$\int_c^df = \int_a^d f - \int^c_a f = 0.$$ By linearity, if $G$ is the finite union of disjoint open intervals, then $\int_G f = 0$ . Now, if $G$ is open, then $G$ is the countable union of disjoint, open intervals, $G = \bigcup^n_{i=1}I_i$ . We have $$\int_G f = \int \lim_{n\to\infty} f \cdot \chi_{\bigcup^n_{i=1} I_i}$$ and since $f_n$ is integrable for all $n$ , and $|f_n| \le f$ for all $n$ , by the dominated convergence theorem, $$\int_G f = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{\bigcup^n_{i=1}I_i} f =0.$$ Now, if $G_n$ is a decreasing sequence of open sets converging to $H$ , since $|f \cdot \chi_{G_n}| \le f \cdot \chi_{G_1}$ for all $n$ , we again have by the DCT that $\int_H f = 0 = \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{G_n}f = 0$ . Finally, if $G$ is a Borel measurable set, then we know that there exists a sequence $G_n$ of decreasing, open sets, that converge to some set $H$ , where $H \setminus G$ is a null set. Thus, $$\int_G f = \int_H f = 0.$$ We have found that for every Borel measurable set $G$ , $\int_G f =0$ .

Proof: If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem , there exists a $c$ such that $f(c)= L$ where $L$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. And similarly, by the same theorem there exists a $c$ such that $g(c)= K$ where $K$ is between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$. We must prove that there is at least one value in the interval such that $K=L$. Since we know $f(a)< g(a)$, therefore at some point $$ f(a)- g(a) < 0 \tag{1}\label{eqn1} $$ and at a distinct point in the interval we know the following will be true: $$f(b)-g(b)>0 \tag{2}\label{eqn2} $$ Now define a function $h(c) = g(c)-f(c)$.
It follows from (1) and (2) that $h(c)>0$ at one point and $h(c)<0$ at another point then by the intermediate value theorem at some point on the interval $h(c)$ must equal to zero. So, $$h(c)= f(c)- g(c) = 0$$

$$f(c)=g(c)$$ For reference to the Intermediate Value Theorem see the following links: https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/intermediate-value-theorem.html https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CFsQFjAIahUKEwjdppOg66HHAhUFjw0KHUQvCOM&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cut-the-knot.org%2FGeneralization%2Fivt.shtml&ei=3lbKVd2_H4WeNsTeoJgO&usg=AFQjCNE4cTobZvz7jim1bUQPx1A35H3jzw&sig2=rsKlZooQCf-Cw0_TWTqMTg&bvm=bv.99804247,d.eXY","['proof-verification', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'proof-writing']"
1386073,Computing curvature of hyperbolic space,"Consider the unit ball in $\mathbb R^2$ endowed with the Poincaré metric: $$ds^2=\frac{4(dx^2+dy^2)}{(1-x^2-y^2)^2}.$$ I want to compute the Gaussian curvature and find that it is $-1$. Given that the curvature is the same at every point (the space is homogeneous and isotropic), it suffices to compute the curvature at $0$. By definition,
$$K=\frac{Rm(\partial_1, \partial_2, \partial_2, \partial_1)}{|\partial_1|^2 |\partial_2|^2}=\frac{Rm(\partial_1, \partial_2, \partial_2, \partial_1)}{16}$$
at the point $(0,0)$, as $\langle \partial_i, \partial_i\rangle = 4$ at $(0,0)$. Computing $R(\partial_1, \partial_2)\partial_2$ and taking the $\partial_1$ component, I get $$\partial_1 \Gamma_{22}^1 - \partial_2 \Gamma_{12}^1.$$
There are also a bunch of products of Christoffel symbols, but since the Christoffel symbols are sums of first derivatives of $f$, and all first derivatives of $f$ are $0$ at $(0,0)$, we can ignore these. I compute 
$$\Gamma^1_{22}=\frac{-f_x}{2f}.$$
$$\Gamma^1_{12}=\frac{f_y}{2f}.$$
$$\partial_1 \Gamma^1_{22}=-\frac{2f f_{xx} - 2f_xf_x}{4f^2}.$$
$$\partial_1 \Gamma^1_{12}=\frac{2f f_{yy} - 2f_yf_y}{4f^2}.$$ Ignoring the first derivatives again and using symmetry, this leads us to consider
$$-\frac{f_{xx}}{f}.$$ This is -4 at 0 (-16/4), and dividing by the factor of 16 noted above gives $-1/4$. We are off by a factor of $4$. Where have I gone wrong? edit: I note it really is a factor of $4$, not another computational error, because doing the calculations with $$ds^2=\frac{4R^4(dx^2+dy^2)}{(R^2-x^2-y^2)^2}$$ yields $-1/(4R^2)$, which is off by $1/4$ from the desired $-1/R^2$. Edit: Let me see if I can adapt @mauddib's answer to my own way of thinking. The error is that the above actually computes $R_{122}^1$/16. (I can't get the LaTeX right, but the raised index should be in the last place.) We must lower the index to get the desired tensor. 
$$R_{1221}=g_{m1}R^1_{221} =g_{11}  \left(-\frac{f_{xx}}{f}\right) = -f_{xx}.$$ Now this is $-16$, so dividing by $16$ gets the right answer. Wonderful.","['differential-geometry', 'riemannian-geometry']"

It turns out that the conjugate is conservative, but not the function itself.

1386169,Critique of this subgroup proof?,"This is an exercise out of a Dover book on abstract algebra. I was hoping I could get some feedback on this proof, as I'm still fairly new to this level of proof writing. Thanks! Here's the exercise: Let $G$ be an Abelian group whose operation is multiplication, let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, and let $K = \{x \in G:$ for some positive integer $ n$, $x^n \in H \}$. Prove that $K$ is a subgroup of $G$. My proof: To show that $K$ is a subgroup of $G$, it is sufficient to show that $K$ is a subset of $G$ and that $K$ is closed under multiplication and inverses. The first condition is trivially satisfied, because $K$ consists only of elements of $G$. We now show that $K$ is closed under multiplication. Let $x,y \in K$. We know $x,y \in G$ and $x^n,y^m \in H$ for some positive integers $m,n$. Additionally, $x^m,y^n \in H$. Since $x,y \in G$ and $G$ is closed under multiplication, $x \cdot y \in G$. Similarly, $x^n \cdot x^m \cdot y^n \cdot y^m \in H$. Now $(x \cdot y)^{n+m} = \underbrace{(x \cdot y) \cdot (x \cdot y) \cdots (x\cdot y)}_\text{n+m}$. Since $G$ is Abelian, we can rearrange this as $\underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{n+m} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{n+m} \\ = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{n} \cdot \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdots x}_\text{m} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{n} \cdot \underbrace{y \cdot y \cdots y}_\text{m} = x^n \cdot x^m \cdot y^n \cdot y^m \in H$. Therefore, since $x \cdot y \in G$, $n+m$ is a positive integer, and $(x \cdot y)^{n+m} \in H$, $x \cdot y \in K$. Therefore, $K$ is closed with respect to multiplication. Now we prove that $K$ is closed with respect to inverses. Let $x \in K$. Therefore $x \in G$ and $x^n \in H$ for some positive integer $n$. Since $x \in G$ and $G$ is closed to inverses, $\frac{1}{x} \in G$. Similarly, $\frac{1}{x^n} \in H$. $(\frac{1}{x})^n = \frac{1}{x^n} \in H$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{x} \in K$, and $K$ is closed with respect to inverses. Thus, $K$ is a subgroup of $G$.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification']"

1386456,Squeeze Theorem for $ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }(3^n+1)^\frac{1}{n} $,"$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }(3^n+1)^\frac{1}{n} $$ I have been having trouble evaluating this limit using the Squeeze Theorem. Every time I've had to use the squeeze theorem so far there's been a component of the function or sequence which has obviously been bounded by two values, for example  $sin(x)$ or $(-1)^\frac {1}{n}$, but I just cant find something like this for this sequence. 
It's quite obvious the answer is 3, as for when n approaches infinity the 1 will make a negligible contribution to the value of the sequence, so the sequence will effectively just take the n'th root of the n'th power of 3, which is of course 3. The obvious answer is just frustrating me more, as I'm required to use the squeeze theorem to evaluate it, and that I can't seem to figure out.

1386606,Probability of rolling a dice 8 times before all numbers are shown.,"What is the probability of having to roll a (six sided) dice at least 8 times before you get to see all of the numbers at least once? I don't really have a clue how to work this out. Edit: If we are trying to find the number of situations where all of the numbers are shown, for seven rolls, a favorable outcome would be one in which there are two numbers the same, for example: 1123456. These numbers can be arranged in 7!/2!5! ways, and there are 6 different numbers that could be repeated.
So the probability of getting all 6 numbers with 7 throws is (6*7!/2!5!)/6^7 = 126/279936. 
Is that right? 
Then 1 minus this is the probability? Edit: prob. of not getting all six numbers with seven rolls = 1-prob of getting all six numbers with seven rolls Six numbers same with seven rolls means one number repeated twice 7!/2! ways of doing this for each repeated number 
6*(7!/2!) is number of ways of getting all six numbers with seven rolls. Total number of outcomes 6^7.
Prob of getting all six numbers with seven rolls = (6*(7!/2!))/6^7 = 0.054

Since $q$ was arbitrary, this proves that $R \circ R \subset R$. Now, suppose that $R \circ R \subset R$. Let $(x,y) \in R$.

How can you see that it is embedded above self-intersection points of $Z$? (If $x$ is a self-intersection point, $T_x Z$ is not defined, so I assume ""$\alpha( v)=0 \text{ for all } v \in T_x Z$"" means $\alpha \big( df_z (v) \big)=0$ for all $v \in T_z Z$ such that $f(z)=x$. Equivalently, $\alpha(\gamma'(0))=0$ for smooth curves $\gamma: (-\epsilon,\epsilon) \to X$ with image in $f(Z)$. Note that $\alpha$ must be zero if $x$ is a transverse self-intersection point.) The above definition is something of a ""forgetful"" conormal bundle, as it is essentially determined by the image $f(Z)$. If we have access to $f$ itself, it seems more natural to me to define the conormal bundle as a subbundle of the pullback of $T^* X \to X$ by $f$: Definition B: $\quad N^*_f(Z):= \{ (z,\alpha) \in Z \times T^* X \mid \alpha \in T^*_{f(z)} X \text{ such that } \alpha\big( df_z (v)\big)=0 \text{ for all } v \in T_z Z\}.
