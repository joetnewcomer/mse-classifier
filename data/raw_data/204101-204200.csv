4039004,"How many permutations of the set n={1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5} are possible without any consecutive identical elements?","I understand that there are $\frac{8!}{3!2!}$ =3600 permutations possible without any restrictions in place. I follow this by attaching all like elements as such {1,2,{3,3,3},{4,4},5} where I can account for 5! permutations where I have three 3s and two 4s in consecutive positions. However, when it comes to accounting for the permutations that, for example, will have three consecutives 3s but not so for the 4s, I am at a loss. I wrote some simple code and came up with a set of 960 permutations as the acceptable answer. As the question implies, I am unsure of how to reach that through other means. My apologies if this is considered elementary and I appreciate any help whatsoever.","['permutations', 'combinatorics', 'discrete-mathematics']"

4039126,"If $X_n$ is an $L_1$-bounded martingale, show that $\sum_n(X_n-X_{n-1})^2< \infty$ a.s.","I had asked this question previously in the following post but there were no replies. Recently, I found a two page article(free download) with a possible alternate line of proof to the one suggested in the first link Note: $X_n$ is an $L_1$ -bounded martingale means that $\sup_nE[|X_n|]<\infty$ However in the link, the author shows that $\sum_n(X_n-X_{n-1})^2< \infty$ a.s. on a set $E$ which is defined as follows: $$E_n:=\bigcap_{k\leq n}\{\omega||X_n(\omega)|\leq M\}\text{ and }E=\bigcap_n E_n.$$ He then states that for large $M$ the measure of $E$ is near 1, since by the martingale convergence theorem, $\sup_n|X_n|<\infty$ which completes the proof. However, I have two issues. Why can the measure of $E$ be made close to 1? Shouldn't we require a set $E$ with measure exactly 1 to show a.s convergence. If so how do we find a set E of measure 1? Can someone please explain how to rectify these issues?","['conditional-probability', 'martingales', 'measure-theory', 'probability-theory']"
4039142,Tilings of a 5×5 square with smaller squares.,"There is a $5 × 5$ array of lights, such that at each step, we may toggle all the lights in any $2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4$ or $5 × 5$ sub-square. Initially all the lights are switched off. After a certain
number of toggles, exactly one light is switched on. Find all the possible positions of the
light Here's what I have done. We can safely ignore the $4 × 4$ squares as they are just a bunch of $2 × 2$ squares put together. Also the sum of the number of $3$ sided squares and $5$ sided squares must be odd as they are the only squares that can change the parity of the total number of turned on lights. As each $3$ sided as well as each $5$ sided square must contain the middle square, it must be turned on after placing these squares. How do I proceed from here?","['contest-math', 'combinatorics', 'tiling', 'discrete-mathematics']"
4039181,"How to prove that the line outside a convex polygon, having the minimum sum of distances is one of the edges?","As part of a computational geometry question, I need a result for an intermediate step. Suppose there is a convex polygon S, with finitely many points inside the polygon. Now, we want to find the line outside the polygon (i.e, the line can pass through a vertex or edge but cannot intersect) which minimizes the sum of perpendicular distances between the line and (vertices + interior points). I have a hunch that we can prove that this line must be one of the edges, but I am unable to find a proof. The simplest approach I tried was checking if rotating a line passing through vertex (but outside polygon) always decreases the sum till it reaches the edge. But this is clearly not true. How to prove this? Note 1: I think that this theorem must be true, but I have not seen it anywhere. It might be possible that it is actually false and the original question can be solved by a different method. If so, I would like to see a counterexample.

4039226,Why does the definition of topological space require that the empty set be open?,"I'm taking my first course in general topology, and so obviously I came across the definition of topological space $(T, \tau)$ : $\tau \in \mathcal P \mathcal P (T)$ $\emptyset, T \in \tau$ $(A_i)_{i \in I} \in \tau \implies \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \in \tau$ $A_1, \dots, A_n \in \tau \implies \bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i \in \tau$ This is very abstract, so I tried to find a few examples, and these examples I found caught my eye: $T = \mathbb R^n$ , $\tau = \{ \text{every set whose complement is compact} \}$ $T = [0,1]$ $\tau = \{ \text{every set whose complement is a finite set}  \}$ Now these satisfy every part of the definition, except that one has to add the empty set to $\tau$ explicitly as well.

4039234,Variance computation in B. Maurey's 'empirical method' proof of the approximate form of Caratheodory's theorem,"I am currently studying the textbook High-Dimensional Probability by Roman Vershynin. Theorem 0.0.2 of the opening chapter Using Probability to Cover a Geometric Set presents the Approximate form of Caratheodory's theorem as follows: Theorem 0.0.2 (Approximate form of Caratheodory's theorem) Consider a set $T \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ whose diameter $^1$ is bounded by $1$ . Then, for every point $x \in \text{conv}(T)$ and every integer $k$ , one can find points $x_1, \dots, x_k \in T$ such that $$\left\vert \left\vert x - \dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k x_j \right\vert \right\vert_2 \le \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{k}}.$$ There are two reasons why this result is surprising. First, the number of points $k$ in convex combinations does not depend on the dimension $n$ . Second, the coefficients of convex combinations can be made all equal. (Note, however, that repetitions among the points $x_i$ are allowed.) $^1$ The diameter of $T$ is defined as $\text{diam}(T) = \text{sup} \{ \vert\vert s - t \vert\vert_2 : s, t \in T \}$ . We have assumed that $\text{diam}(T) = 1$ for simplicity. For a general set $T$ , the bound in the theorem changes to $\text{diam}(T)/\sqrt{k}$ . Check this! Proof Our argument is known as the empirical method of B. Maurey. Translating $T$ if necessary, we may assume that not only the diameter but also the radius of $T$ is bounded by $1$ , i.e., $$\vert\vert t \vert\vert_2 \le 1 \ \ \ \text{for all $t \in T$}. \tag{0.2}$$ Fix a point $x \in \text{conv}(T)$ and express it as a convex combination of some vectors $z_1, \dots, z_m \in T$ as in (0.1). Now, interpret the definition of the convex combination (0.1) probabilistically, with the $\lambda_i$ taking the roles of probabilities. Specifically, we can define a random vector $Z$ that takes the value $z_i$ with probability $\lambda_i$ : $$\mathbb{P} \{ Z = z_i \} = \lambda_i, \ \ \ i = 1, \dots, m.$$ (This is possible by the fact that the weights $\lambda_i$ are non-negative and sum to $1$ .) Then $$\mathbb{E} Z = \sum_{i = 1}^m \lambda_i z_i = x .$$ Consider independent copies $Z_1, Z_2, \dots$ of $Z$ . by the strong law of large numbers, $$\dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j \to x \ \ \ \text{almost surely as $k \to \infty$} .$$ To get a quantitative form of this result, let us compute the variance of $\dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j$ . (Incidentally, this computation is at the heart of the proof of the weak law of large numbers.) We obtain $$\begin{align} \mathbb{E} \left\vert \left\vert x - \dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j \right\vert \right\vert_2^2 &= \dfrac{1}{k^2} \mathbb{E} \left\vert \left\vert \sum_{j = 1}^k (Z_j - x) \right\vert \right\vert_2^2 \ \ \ \text{(since $\mathbb{E} (Z_i - x) = 0)$} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{k^2} \sum_{j = 1}^k \mathbb{E} \vert\vert Z_j - x \vert\vert_2^2 . \end{align}$$ I am unsure about this part: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{E} \left\vert \left\vert x - \dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j \right\vert \right\vert_2^2 &= \dfrac{1}{k^2} \mathbb{E} \left\vert \left\vert \sum_{j = 1}^k (Z_j - x) \right\vert \right\vert_2^2 \ \ \ \text{(since $\mathbb{E} (Z_i - x) = 0)$} \\ &= \dfrac{1}{k^2} \sum_{j = 1}^k \mathbb{E} \vert\vert Z_j - x \vert\vert_2^2 . \end{align}$$ The Wikipedia article for variance derives variance using expected values as follows: $${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\operatorname {Var} (X)&=\operatorname {E} \left[(X-\operatorname {E} [X])^{2}\right]\\[4pt]&=\operatorname {E} \left[X^{2}-2X\operatorname {E} [X]+\operatorname {E} [X]^{2}\right]\\[4pt]&=\operatorname {E} \left[X^{2}\right]-2\operatorname {E} [X]\operatorname {E} [X]+\operatorname {E} [X]^{2}\\[4pt]&=\operatorname {E} \left[X^{2}\right]-\operatorname {E} [X]^{2}\end{aligned}}}$$ Comparing this Wikipedia proof to the textbook proof, I don't see the correspondence. In particular, I don't see how the expressions $\mathbb{E} \left\vert \left\vert x - \dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j \right\vert \right\vert_2^2$ and $\dfrac{1}{k^2} \sum_{j = 1}^k \mathbb{E} \vert\vert Z_j - x \vert\vert_2^2$ are analogous to the expressions in the Wikipedia proof of variance. It seems to me that the presence of the $L^2$ -norm is the odd part out. So how exactly is this textbook proof analogous to a variance computation of $\dfrac{1}{k} \sum_{j = 1}^k Z_j$ ?","['proof-explanation', 'variance', 'probability-theory']"

Then $\overline{A\cup B}=(A\cup B)\cup L_{A\cup B}$ . $L_{A\cup B}=L_{A}\cup L_{B}$ , so $\overline{A\cup B}=(A\cup B)\cup (L_{A}\cup L_{B})$ .

4039555,An Inequality of Expected Value of Random Variables,"I encountered the following problem in my research: Suppose there are $N$ random variables that are independent and identically distributed (IID). The probability density function (PDF) of these random variables $f(x)$ is a unimodal function symmetrical about $0$ (i.e., $f(x)$ is non-decreasing within $(-∞,0)$ , and for any $x$ , $f(x) = f(-x)$ holds. for example, the distribution can be uniform distribution, normal distribution, Cauchy distribution with mean $0$ , etc.). For a given real number $x_0$ , Sort these random variables as $X_1, X_2, …, X_N$ such that $$|X_1-x_0|\leq |X_2-x_0| \leq … \leq |X_N-x_0|$$ For example, if $N = 3$ , the $N$ random variables are randomly chosen as $-0.5, 1.5, 5$ , and $x_0 = 1$ , then $X_1 = 1.5, X_2 = -0.5, X_3 = 5$ . Let $Y_i = |\frac{X_1+X_2+…+X_i}{i}-x_0|^r (i=1,…,N, r = 1\ or\ 2)$ ,  then for any $x_0$ and $f(x)$ , does the inequality $$EY_1 \leq EY_2 \leq… \leq EY_N$$ always hold?

4039999,"Modifying the covariance of Brownian motion, what Gaussian process do we get?","If $(B_t)$ is a Brownian motion, then $Cov(B_t,B_s)=min(t,s)$ . Take a Gaussian process $(X_t)$ with mean $0$ and covariance $Cov(X_t,X_s)=f(min(t,s))$ for a given function $f$ such that the covariance is still positive definite. Is $X$ related to Brownian motion ? For example, let's take an easy function: $f(x)=x+1$ , then clearly $X_t=B_{t+1}$ , or more generally, if $f$ is monotone increasing, then $X_t=B_{f(t)}= \int_0^t \sqrt{f'(s)} \, dB_s$ (where the last equality is valid under integrability/differentiability conditions). But what happens when $f$ is not monotone ? For example, $Cov(X_t,X_s)=min(t,s)(1-min(t,s))$ . This is a covariance function on $[0,1]$ . Can we describe $X$ using Brownian motion on $[0,1]$ ? Idea: decompose $f$ on intervals on which it is increasing and decreasing. Use the above for the increasing parts. But what happens when $f$ is decreasing ? For our example that would be $f(x)=x(1-x)$ on $[0.5,1]$ ?","['stochastic-analysis', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

When searching for books on time series and panel data I got really good recommendations but all the books were more leaning towards the applied aspect. Either the books focused more on the computer science aspect (how to plot time series, how to execute Dickey-Fuller test, how to run regressions on panel data) accompanied with intuition but there are no proofs. Sometimes basic stuff is proven (like AR(1) is stationary if and only if the coefficient next to the laggued variable is between -1 and 1). But, I've already seen a similar question asked here and the only recommended book that meets my needs is this one : Time Series Theory and Methods by Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis. The one that suggested this book said, I quote, ""This used to be (still is?) the main reference for Time Series back in the day for those theoretically inclined.""

4040510,"How can I evaluate average with negative values, given I will apply this weight for both negative and positive values","I am more a programming guy than math one, so please be easy on me with math expressions Before I start describing to make it clear: I have 2 types of scores: reddit score and sentiment score.
Reddit score can be of any value.
Sentiment score ranges between -1 and 1 So my task is to calculate weight for each sentiment score. Besides analyzing post for sentiments I want to give this post a weight to enhance evaluation of sentiment value it carries Basically it would look like this sentiment value = sentiment_analyzer(post) * weight I want to use average of reddit scores, which can be both negative and positive
Then apply this average to calculate weight the following way: weight = reddit_score / average(reddit_scores) So here comes the problem, it is not typical but what happens if average will end up negative ?
On one hand we can leave it as is, hoping this will never happen, but if it will it would ruin all scoring (I guess ?) , on the other we can't just make it positive and ignore that fact it was originally calculated with negative values. Maybe I am missing some basic Math concepts, but I really can remember this situation, when I studied Math. As for method itself I understand it far from accurate, but I am also limited on functions, so I would be grateful if you tell me whether this weight estimation method makes sense at all.

I have actually succeeded in finding a closed form for the special case $(a,b)=(a,\tfrac{a}{2})$ : $$J(a,\tfrac{a}{2})=\frac{\pi^2}{2a}-\frac{\pi}{a}\arctan\sqrt{a+1}-\frac1a\arctan^2\sqrt{\frac{2}{a}},$$ which comes from the more general result $$J(a,b)+J(a,a-b)=\phi_2(a,b)-\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)+\phi_2(a,a-b),\tag2$$ where $$\phi_1(x)=\int_0^1\frac{dt}{x+t^2}=\int_1^\infty\frac{dt}{1+xt^2}=\frac1{\sqrt x}\arctan\frac1{\sqrt x},$$ and $$\phi_2(a,b)=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{b(a-b)}}\arctan\sqrt{\frac{a-b}{b(a+1)}}.$$ I will supply a proof below. Proof of $(2)$ . Let $$f(z)=\int_0^1\frac{\arctan(z\sqrt{t^2+a})}{(t^2+b)\sqrt{t^2+a}}dt,$$ so that $J(a,b)=f(1)$ . Then clearly $$J(a,b)=f(1)=\lim_{z\to\infty}f(z)-\int_1^\infty f'(z)dz.$$ Then since $\lim_{z\to\infty}\arctan(xz)=\pi/2$ for $x>0$ , we have $$J(a,b)=\frac\pi2\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)\sqrt{t^2+a}}-\int_1^\infty\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)(z^2t^2+az^2+1)}dz.$$ The first integral is relatively simple: $$\begin{align}
\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)\sqrt{t^2+a}}&=\int_0^{1/\sqrt{a}}\frac{du}{(au^2+b)\sqrt{u^2+1}}\qquad[t\mapsto u\sqrt{a}]\\
&=\int_0^{\arctan 1/\sqrt{a}}\frac{\sec^2x\,dx}{(a\tan^2x+b)\sqrt{\tan^2x+1}}\qquad[u\mapsto \tan x]\\
&=\int_0^{\arctan 1/\sqrt{a}}\frac{\cos x\,dx}{b+(a-b)\sin^2x}\\
&=\int_0^{1/\sqrt{a+1}}\frac{dt}{b+(a-b)t^2}\qquad [\sin x\mapsto t]\\
&=\left.\frac{1}{\sqrt{b(a-b)}}\arctan\left(t\sqrt{\frac{a-b}{b}}\right)\right|_0^{1/\sqrt{a+1}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{b(a-b)}}\arctan\sqrt{\frac{a-b}{b(a+1)}}=\frac2\pi\phi_2(a,b).\tag3
\end{align}$$ The next integral is also manageable: $$\begin{align}
\int_1^\infty f'(z)dz&=\int_1^\infty\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)(z^2t^2+az^2+1)}dz\\
&=\int_1^\infty\int_0^1\frac{1}{1+(a-b)z^2}\left(\frac{1}{t^2+b}-\frac{1}{t^2+a+1/z^2}\right)dtdz\\
&=\int_1^\infty\frac{1}{1+(a-b)z^2}\left(\phi_1(b)-\phi_1(a+1/z^2)\right)dz\\
&=\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)-\int_1^\infty \frac{\arctan(1/\sqrt{a+1/z^2})}{(1+(a-b)z^2)\sqrt{a+1/z^2}}dz\\
&=\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)-\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan(1/\sqrt{t^2+a})}{(t^2+(a-b))\sqrt{t^2+a}}dt\qquad [z\mapsto 1/t]\\
&=\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)-\int_0^1 \frac{\tfrac\pi2-\arctan\sqrt{t^2+a}}{(t^2+(a-b))\sqrt{t^2+a}}dt\\
&=\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)-\frac\pi2\int_0^1 \frac{dt}{(t^2+(a-b))\sqrt{t^2+a}}+\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan\sqrt{t^2+a}}{(t^2+(a-b))\sqrt{t^2+a}}dt\\
&=\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)-\phi_2(a,a-b)+J(a,a-b).\tag4
\end{align}$$ Then from $(3)$ and $(4)$ , $$J(a,b)=\phi_2(a,b)-\phi_1(b)\phi_1(a-b)+\phi_2(a,a-b)-J(a,a-b),$$ as desired. Is there some way to find a closed form for $J$ ? EDIT: One may use the series $$g(z)=\frac{\arctan\sqrt z}{\sqrt z}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n-1}\left(\frac{1}{z^n}-\frac{2}{\sqrt z}\right)\qquad z\ge1$$ to get $$J(a,b)=-\phi_2(a,b)+\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(-1)^n}{2n-1}\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)(t^2+a)^n},$$ where $\phi_2$ is defined above. The integral $\int_0^1\frac{dt}{(t^2+b)(t^2+a)^n}$ is really not nice though.","['integration', 'definite-integrals', 'real-analysis', 'calculus', 'closed-form']"

Is it true that $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid #138D75]{\tan\left(\frac {\alpha}2\right)=\frac{1-\cos\alpha}{\sin \alpha}, \quad ?} \tag1$$ My solution :
First, we note that the expression $\tan \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )$ makes sense when $\alpha \neq \pi + 2k\pi, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ : henceforth, we will assume that this condition is met. By definition of tangent function, we have: $$\tan \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{ \sin \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}{\cos \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}$$ When $\alpha \neq 2k \pi, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ , we can multiply numerator and denominator by $\sin \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )$ , because this quantity is non-zero. We therefore get: $$\tan \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{ \sin^2 \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}{\cos \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) \cdot \sin \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )}. $$ For what we saw earlier: $$\sin^2 \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{1 - \cos \alpha}{2}$$ and instead, applying the sine duplication formula : $$\cos \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) \cdot \sin \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{1}{2} \sin \alpha$$ In conclusion we get the following formula: $$\tan \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{ 1 - \cos \alpha}{\sin \alpha}.$$ If in the expression of the tangent we had multiplied numerator and denominator by $\cos \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right )$ then with steps similar to what we have done we get another formula: $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid #118D45]{\tan \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) = \frac{\sin \alpha}{1 + \cos \alpha}}. \tag 2 $$ We note that it always holds $\cos \left ( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right ) \neq 0$ since we have imposed $\alpha \neq \pi + 2k\pi, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ (and this entitles us to multiply numerator and denominator by this term).

4041473,Group theory exercise.,"Show that every group G with identity e such that $x ∗ x = e$ for all $x ∈ G$ , is abelian. If $G$ is a finite group of even order, then there exists $a ∈ G$ such that $a\neq e$ and $a^2 = e$ . My attempt. For the first point, since $ x * x = e $ , it can be followed that $ x = x ^ {- 1} $ . Then, for $ a, b \in G $ we have that $ (ab) = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1} a^{-1} = ba $ . And that shows that $ G $ is abelian. For the second point. Let $ G $ be the given group and for each $ g \in G $ let us consider the set $ \{g, g ^ {- 1} \} $ . This set has two elements if $ g \neq g ^ {- 1} $ and a single element (per repetition) if $ g = g - 1 $ . So, $$ | G | = 2 | \{\{g, g ^ {- 1} \} \mid g \neq g ^ {- 1} \} | + | \{g \in G \mid g = g ^ {- 1} \} |. $$ Since $ | G | $ is even and the first addend of the second member is also, the cardinal of $ \{g \in G \mid g = g ^ {- 1} \} $ must be even. Then, since the neutral $ e \in \{g \in G \mid g = g ^ {- 1} \} $ , then there must exist a $ g \in G $ with $ g \neq e $ such that $ g = g^{-1} $ , this is $ g ^ 2 = e $ , which ends the test.","['group-theory', 'solution-verification']"

4041516,Understanding the symmetries of f(x)=7x (mod 12),"I found something interesting while studying the circle of fifths. Define a map $f(x) = 7x$ (mod 12), this models the circle of fifths as a table. The input is the location on the circle of fifths, the output is the note at that location on the circle of fifths. You could also read the input as the number of sharps or flats in the scale. So $f(2) = 14 \equiv 2$ (mod 12) reads ""the scale with two sharps is D"" or ""two o'clock on the circle of fifths is D"". And $f(-1) = -7 \equiv 5$ (mod 12) reads ""the scale with one flat is F"". The function f is an involution, because $f(f(x)) = 7(7x) = 49x= (48 + 1)x \equiv x$ (mod 12). While pairing up the elements, a beautiful relation appeared: A line between two numbers means those numbers map to each other, no line means the number maps to itself. It's easy to verify this picture, Proof: Evens are fixed because: $f(2n) = 7(2n) = 14n = (12 + 2)n \equiv 2n$ (mod 12) Odds map to the opposite side of the circle because: $f(2n + 1) = f(2n) + f(1) = 2n + f(1) = 2n + 7 = (2n + 1) + 6$ My goal is to understand the above picture better, I'm open to general suggestions about how to do this, but I got stuck trying something very specific. I'm trying to articulate the question ""Prove the symmetries of this function are $D_{12}$ "" I've begun by defining: $i(n) = n$ (mod 12) $r(n) = n + 2$ (mod 12) $s(n) = -n$ (mod 12)
These satisfy: $r^6 = s^2 = (rs)^2 = i$ which make them generators of $D_{12}$ . I'm struggling to continue my argument, here is my current attempt: Now let $D_{12}$ act on $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z})$ by conjugation. So for $g \in \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z}, \mathbf{Z}/12\mathbf{Z})$ and $p \in D_{12}$ we have $p \cdot g = p g p^{-1}$ . Now we can show $D_{12}$ fixes $f$ , it follows from $r \cdot f (x) = r f r^{-1} (x) = - f(- x) = - 7(- x) = 7x = f(x)$ and $s \cdot f(x) = s f s^{-1} (x) = f(x - 2) + 2 = f(x) - 2 + 2 = f(x)$ I have a handful of misgivings with my thoughts so far. I don't know what larger group should be thought of as containing $D_{12}$ . And $f$ being a fixed point of a group doesn't prove it isn't a fixed point of some larger group. Right now, my current approach for a fix of this is to prove that the stabilizer subgroup of the permutations with respect to $f$ equals the dihedral group: ${S_{12}}_f = D_{12}$ . Is there a more specific ambient space than just permutations though? Aren't I cheating by applying an arbitrary permutation to a ring isomorphism. And that's what my map is right? Or is it actually a $Z/12Z$ - module isomorphism? I feel very stuck on what I think are some pretty basic concepts. I have a strong intuition for the symmetries of this circle now, For example from the above it's clear that f having one flat is equivalent to b having five sharps. But I'm struggling translating these intuitions into algebraic proofs. I would appreciate any help incorporating $D_{12}$ into wherever it belongs. Best, Edit: I tried to clarify my definition. I'm getting suggestions that I either meant, or should be using the function $m(k) = k + 7$ (mod 12). I labeled it "" $m$ "" for modulate. It has the advantage that the inputs and the outputs are both semitones.

For the purpose of self-studying, I purchased the solution manual, as well. After completing the first two chapters and going through all practice problems, I am now painfully aware that I am not particularly great at proofs involving clever equation manipulations. As I progressed through my aforementioned set theory book, I felt like the number of ""proof flavors"" (different strategies one could invoke to tackle the claim) were quite manageable. Figuring out which path to pursue  seemed to be categorically recognizable. However , when it comes to proofs involving equation manipulation, I literally feel like I am staring into a sea of hundreds of possible permutations (in the English sense) that one might use to arrive at the desired conclusion. From what I have seen so far, the strategies largely seem to involve the invocation of Field Axioms (e.g. creative usages of $0$ and $1$ through the existence of additive inverses and  multiplicative inverses, respectively) and factoring (that often times feels quite contrived). I was wondering if there were any general tips and tricks as to how one might improve his/her ability in recognizing the type of equation manipulation that a given proof is suggesting (yelling) to carry out. I am assuming the seasoned mathsters have some sort of pattern recognition that goes off in their heads that allows for efficient determination of starting points. I apologize if this question is a little too broad. I recognize that every proof may necessarily be ""special"", so in the absence of a specific example, perhaps this question is unanswerable.

Furthermore, $\rho$ is proper. I do not understand what it means for $\rho$ to be proper. I originally thought it meant that base change by a scheme yielded a proper map, but I have been told that $\rho$ does not need to be representable (either by algebraic spaces or schemes), so we can't use this definition. The only other definition that I know is that a map of stacks $f:\mathscr X \to \mathscr Y$ has property $P$ if there exists a chart for $f$ by schemes (which is a diagram such as below) such that $h$ has property $P$ . Note in this diagram X and Y are schemes, $Y \to \mathscr Y$ is surjective and smooth, and $\mathscr{X}^\prime$ is the fibre product of the square on the right. This definition is Definition 8.2.6 in Olsson's book Algebraic Spaces and Stacks. Unfortunately, this definition is only given for properties $P$ which are stable and local on domain (in the smooth topology). But properness is not local. So I am wondering what the definition of properness is? Can we use the same definition in terms of a chart, regardless of whether or not the property is local on the domain?","['algebraic-stacks', 'algebraic-geometry', 'moduli-space']"
4041692,Solving a Second Order Linear Homogeneous ODE Without an Ansatz/Characteristic Polynomial.,"I wanted to try solving the following differential equation: $$y''+ay'+by=0$$ without using the ansatz of $y=e^{kt}$ . This means using separation of variables, substitutions, or an integrating factor to possibly find the solution. If we let $a=0$ , it becomes easier to find a solution with that constraint: $$y''=-by$$ $$\int y''\cdot y'dt=-b\int y\cdot y'dt$$ $$\left(y'\right)^{2}=-by^{2}+c$$ $$\frac{dy}{dt}=\sqrt{c-by^{2}}$$ $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}\int \frac{dy}{\sqrt{1-\frac{b}{c}y^{2}}}=\int_{ }^{ }dt$$ let $\omega=\sqrt{b}$ , and $R=\sqrt{\frac{c}{b}}$ : $$\frac{1}{\omega}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{R}y\right)=t+D$$ let $D\cdot\omega=\delta$ $$y(t)=R\sin\left(\omega t+\delta\right)$$ In fact any equation of the form $$y''=-by^{n}$$ can be simplified into a solution containing an indefinite integral at least (since u sub can be done on the right).
If I tried the same technique, but when a is nonzero. I end up with: $$\int_{ }^{ }y''\cdot y'dt+\int_{ }^{ }a\left(y'\right)^{2}dt+\int_{ }^{ }by\cdot y'dt=0$$ I don't know how to integrate the $\left(y'\right)^{2}$ term though. I then tried using an integration factor. I wrote the equation as: $$-\frac{1}{a}y''=y'+\frac{b}{a}y$$ let $\mu\left(t\right)=e^{\frac{b}{a}t}$ . By doing some rearranging: $$-\frac{1}{a}\int_{ }^{ }e^{\frac{b}{a}t}y''dt=e^{\frac{b}{a}t}y$$ I don't know how to the integral on the left either :S I know that the actual solution ends up being an exponential function times a trig function (through the ansatz method, which is admittedly much faster), but I would like to derive the solution without using that method. Thanks EDIT: I think I specifically want to preserve the part where you integrate to get arcsin. Using an ansatz, and then eulers method sort of gets around that step. I guess I wanted to see specifically where that trig function comes in, and that was easy to see when a=0.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

Method 1:- $$1^12^23^34^4...n^n\leq 1!2!3!4!...n!e^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$$ $$\implies\bigg(\frac{1^1}{1!}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{2^2}{2!}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{3^3}{3!}\bigg)...\bigg(\frac{n^n}{n!}\bigg)\leq e^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$$ $\implies \displaystyle\prod_{x=1}^{n} \frac{x^x}{x!}\leq 
e^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ Now taking logarithm on both sides of inequality. $\implies \displaystyle\sum_{x=1}^{n} \ln\bigg(\frac{x^x}{x!}\bigg)\leq 
{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ $\implies \displaystyle\sum_{x=1}^{n} \ln\bigg(\frac{x^x}{x!}\bigg)\leq 
{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}-n$ $\implies \displaystyle\sum_{x=1}^{n} \ln\bigg(\frac{x^x}{x!}\bigg)\leq 
\bigg(\sum_{x=1}^{n} x \bigg)-n$ $\implies \displaystyle \ \sum_{x=1}^{n} x -\displaystyle\sum_{x=1}^{n} \ln\bigg(\frac{x^x}{x!}\bigg)\geq n$ $\implies \displaystyle \ \sum_{x=1}^{n} x + \ln\bigg(\frac{x!}{x^x}\bigg)\geq n$ $$\implies 1+1.30+1.49+1.63+1.74+1.82+1.90+1.97+2.02+...\geq n$$ $\implies 1+(1+0.30)+(1+0.49)+(1+0.63)+(1+0.74)+...\geq  {\smash[b]{1+\! \underbrace{1+1+\cdots1\,}_\text{$n$ times}}}$ This proves our first inequality. Method 2:- Using $\frac{n^n}{n!}\leq e^{n-1}$ for $n\in N$ . $\frac{1^1}{1!}\leq e^{0}$ $\frac{2^2}{2!}\leq e^{1}$ $\frac{3^3}{3!}\leq e^{2}$ $\vdots\\$ $\frac{n^n}{n!}\leq e^{n-1}$ Now multiply all above inequalities we get, $\implies \displaystyle\prod_{x=1}^{n} \frac{x^x}{x!}\leq 
e^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ Using the same approach for $2^{nd}$ inequality we get, $$\sum_{x=1}^{n} \ln\bigg(\frac{{f_{x}}^{f_{x}}}{f_{x}!}\bigg)\leq f_{n+2}-n-1$$ Now I got stuck on this step. How can we prove the $2^{nd}$ inequality.

First, everything that's not algebraic (blue) is transcendental, but this picture shows only transcendental numbers that are also irrational and ignores the rest. Second, it does not acknowledge the fact that 0 is both real and pure imaginary. Also, I really don't like that natural numbers are called counting numbers here. Like, it's a pretty advanced diagram definitely not targeted at elementary school students, so just call it natural. Here is another example: This one is interesting.

given $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Omega)$ the $\sigma$ -algebra of Borel sets and $\Omega$ locally compact separeble space we say that a set function $\mu$ is a real Radon measure if it is a measure on the spaces $(K,\mathcal{B}(K))$ $\forall K \subset \Omega \text{ compact } $ that the same set function $\mu$ is a finite Radon measure if it is also a measure $\mathcal{B}(\Omega)$ First, I assume (for the confidence I place on my professor) that those definitions are equivalent in this setting to the more common ones based on the regularity of the measure. Moreover, given $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ open nonempty, I was given this form of the Riesz's representation theorem: $\forall L$ linear and bouned functional on $C_0(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$ $\exists!$ $\mathbb{R}^m$ -valued Radon measure $\mu$ such that the operatorial norm of $L$ is equal to the total variation of $\mu$ and $$\forall v \in C_0(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m) \quad Lv=\int_{\Omega}\sum_{j=1}^{m}v_j \ d\mu_j$$ My problem arise when considering the space $\mathcal{M}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$ of bounded variation measures (I do not report here the definition fot the sake of brevity, but it is the usual one that can be found also here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_measure ). My professor states that $\mathcal{M}(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$ is the topological dual of $C_0(\Omega;\mathbb{R}^m)$ by the Riesz's theorem above stated, but this means that every finite Radon measure is bounded variation. How can be this? I know that every real valued measure (no $\pm \infty $ values allowed) is bounded variation (cf. Rudin, RCA, p.118 thm 6.4), but this is not true for $\mathbb{R}^m$ -vector valued measures in general (am I wrong?) and so we are asserting that any $\mathbb{R}^m$ -vector valued finite Radon measure in the sense above is also bounded variation, so any finite Radon measure is bounded variation?
