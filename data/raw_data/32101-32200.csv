303944,"Randomly selected subset, expected value of the sum","Interesting problem I spotted while learning: Let $X=\left\{1,..,n\right\}$ . We randomly select subset of $X$ and name it $A$ . Each subset if equally likely. a) Find the expected value of the sum of elements of A. b) Find the expected value of the sum of elements of A, on condition that it has $k$ elements. a) I think I know how to solve a). If each subset is selected with the same probability then I think it is equivalent to selecting each element of $X$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ . So, using indicators, we got that expected value we are looking for is $\frac{n(n+1)}{4}$ . But I can't find any rigorous argument why it is equivalent to selecting each element with probability $1/2$ . b) Small observation with $k=1$ (each element selected with probability $1/n$ ) and $k=n$ (each element selected with probability $1$ ) gives me feeling that approach from a) can be used with probability $k/n$ and then the result is $\frac{k(n+1)}{2}$ . But it is much less intuitive than observation in a). No idea, how to prove this. Can anyone help?",['probability']

303987,Proving that the reciprocal of an irrational is irrational,"The question I am working on is: Prove that if x is irrational, then 1/x is irrational. My proof differs from the one given in the answer key; but I still feel that mine is valid. Could someone possibly look over my proof to see if it is correct? Proof by contraposition: If $1/x$ is rational, then x is a rational number. Assuming that $x \ne 0$, then $1/x$ is by definition a rational number; taking the reciprocal of this, x is will be some number, other than zero, that can be written as $x/1$, which is a rational number by definition. Since we have proven the contrapositive to be true, then the original statement must be true. EDIT: I found this solution on the internet. Proof: We prove the contrapositive: If 1=x is rational, then x is rational. So suppose 1=x is rational. Then
  there exist integers p; q, with q = 0, such that 1 6 =x = p=q. Then x = q=p is clearly rational, unless p = 0.
  However, the case that p = 0 can't occur, because if p = 0, then 1=x = p=q = 0. But 1=x is never zero. My question is, what is the point in mentioning the case that $p=0$. Isn't it safe to assume that, once you reach the point when you take the reciprocal, $p$ can't equal zero??","['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing']"

304014,"show that $l(T)$, the number of leaves of a full binary tree $T$, is 1 more than $i(T )$, the number of internal vertices of $T$.","I have to provide a structural proof for this:
show that $l(T)$, the number of leaves of a full binary tree $T$, is 1 more than $i(T )$, the number of internal vertices of $T$. I have the following, and I'm wondering if I'm doing this correctly. I have no idea what the inductive hypothesis is here... Thanks in advance! The set of all full binary trees $B$ can be defined recursively as: $T_0$ is in $B$ such that $T_0$ has $i(T_0) = 1$ number of internal vertices  and $l(T_0) = 2$ number of leaves. For any tree $T_n$ in $B$, $T_{n+1}$ is in $B$ such that $T_{n+1}$ has $i(T_{n+1}) = i(T_n) + 1$ number of internal vertices, and $l(T_{n+1}) = l({T_n}) + 1 $ number of leaves. Structural Inductive Proof: Base Step: Tree $T_0$ has 1 internal vertex and 2 leaves. so the number of leaves is 1 more than the number of internal vertices. Inductive Step: Since, each tree in $B$ is generated from the  base case by adding 1 to the number of leaves and 1 to the number of vertices, and since the base tree in $B$ has 1 more leaf than internal vertex, every full binary tree has 1 more leaf than internal vertex.","['discrete-mathematics', 'proof-writing']"

  where $B(x, r) = \{y : |x − y| \le r\}$ is the ball of radius $r$, and $|B(0, r)|$ is the volume of the ball of radius $r$. The question is Suppose $f$ is superharmonic on $R^d$. Let $\xi_1 , \xi_2 , ...$ be i.i.d. uniform

304102,Some properties of an analogue of the integral Fourier operator,"Let $\phi(x,\theta)$ be an infinitely differentiable function in $X^2 = X \times X$, where $X = \mathop{\mathsf{int}}\mathbb{R}^n_{+}$, and let$\phi(\lambda x, \theta) = \phi(x,\lambda \theta) = \lambda \phi(x,\theta)$ for any $\lambda > 0$ (positive homogenity). Define $\Phi(x,y,\theta)=\phi(x,\theta)-\phi(y,\theta)$. Let $A(x,y,\theta)$ be an infinetely differentiable function in $X^3 = X\times X \times X$ such that $A(x,y,\theta)=0$ for any $\theta$ with $|\theta|<\varepsilon$ and $A(x,y,\theta)$ and any its partial derivative of any order exponentially decreases as a function of $\theta$ uniformly with respect to $(x,y)$ on any compact set $K\subset X^2$. I define an operator $F$ which acts on functions from $C_{0}(X)$ by the rule
$$
   F[u](y) = \int\limits_{X} \int\limits_{X} e^{i \Phi(x,y,\theta)} A(x,y,\theta) u(x) \, dx\,d\theta
$$
I have two questions. Question 1 Is it true that $F[u](y) \in C^{1}(X)$, but $F[u](y) \notin C^{2}(X)$ in general? $\square$ Let $K$ be a support of $u(x)$, then there exist $C(K)$ and $\alpha(K)>0$ such that 
$$
   |A(x,y,\theta)| \leqslant C(K) e^{-\alpha(K)\theta}
$$
for any $x \in K$, $y \in K$. This proves the absolute and uniform convergence of integral $F[u](y)$ on any compact set $K \subset X$ and hence we obtain continuity of $F[u](y)$. Next, the same arguments can be used to show that we can differentiate $F[u](y)$ under the integral sign and that derivative is continuous. If I'm not mistaken we can't continue this procedure in general because of decreasing degrees of homogeneity of derivatives of $\Phi$. $\blacksquare$ Now lets introduce a set 
$$
   C_{\Phi} = \left\{ (x,y,\theta) \in X^3 \mid \Phi_{\theta}(x,y,\theta)=0 \right\}.
$$ Question 2 How to show that if $C_{\Phi} = \left\{(x,x,\theta) \mid x \in X, \theta \in X \right\}$ then operator $F[u](x)$ can be extended to the operator from $L^2_{0}(X)$ to $L^{2}_{loc}(X)$ such that $F = I + K$, $I$ is the identity operator, $K$ is compact? I have absolutely no ideas concerning second question, any help is very appreciated. Actually I don't feel deeply the role of condition on set $C_{\Phi}$. Please help me with it. Update (15.02.13) Let's show that $F \in \mathcal{L}(L^2_{0},L^{2}_{loc})$. $\square$ It sufficient to show that for any $g \in C^{\infty}_{0}(X)$ there exists $C>0$ and a compact $K$ in $X$ such that for any $u \in L^{2}(K)$ we have $\|gF[u]\| \leqslant C \|u\|$. Let $h(x) \in C^{\infty}_{0}(X)$, $h(x)=1$ in some heighborhood of $X$. Then it is sufficient to show that $\|gF[hu]\| \leqslant C \|u\|$, on the left we have an integral operator with smooth kernel
$$
    e^{i\Phi(x,y,\theta)}A(x,y,\theta)g(x)h(y)
$$
with compact support with respect to $(x,y)$. So without loss of generality we can consider the case when $A(x,y,\theta)$ has a compact support $K_1 \times K_2$ with respect to $(x,y)$. By definition of $A(x,y,\theta)$ there exist such $C_1>0$ and $\alpha>0$ that
$$
   |A(x,y,\theta)| \leqslant C_1 e^{-\alpha |\theta|}
$$
for any $x,y \in X$. Then we have an estimate
$$
   |F[u](x)| \leqslant C_1 \chi_{K_1}(x) \int\limits_{X} e^{-\alpha |\theta|} \, d\theta \,  \int\limits_{K_2} u(y) \, dy \leqslant C_2 |K_2| \chi_{K_1}(x) \|u\|
$$
From this we get the required inequality. $\blacksquare$ Now the only question is why $F$ is a sum of the identity operator and of a compact operator.","['functional-analysis', 'integral-transforms']"

We  call a time-discrete, real-valued, adapted process $X$ (e.i. $X : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^{\Omega}$ and $X_i$ is $\mathcal{F}_i$-measurable) a discrete semi-martingale. A theorem from Doob states, that every discrete semi-martingale $X$ can be uniquely represented as $X = M + A + X_0$, where $M$ is a Martingale, $A$ is a predictable process and $M_0 = A_0 = 0$. This representation is called the Doob decomposition of $X$. The process $A$ is called the compensator of $X$. For two discrete semi-martingales $X,Y$ we call $[X,Y]_n := \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta X_i\Delta Y_i$ the variation of $X$ and $Y$. The compensator of the discrete semi-martingale $[X,Y]:=([X,Y]_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is called the covariation of $X$ and $Y$ andis denoted by $\langle X,Y \rangle$. One can show that the variation as well as the covariation are symmetric and bilinear.
The variation maps a tuple of discrete semi-martingales onto a discrete semi-martingale. The covariation maps a tuple of discrete semi-martingales onto a predictable process. Here is my first question: Is there any connection between a scalar product (or even a Hilbertspace) and the variation or covariation?

304181,Can we do some scaling argument in the presence of inhomogeneous norms?,"Notation : $B^n_R$ stands for the ball of radius $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. $\hat{f}$ stands for the Fourier transform of $f$. Question . The following inequality holds true for all $f\in H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and all measurable $t=t(x)$ provided that $s>1/2$ ($^1$):
  $$\tag{1}\left\lVert \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\, \hat{f}(\xi)e^{i(x\cdot\xi-t(x)\lvert\xi\rvert^2)}\, d\xi\right\rVert_{L^2_x(B^n_R)}\le C_s R^{\frac{1}{2}}\lVert f \rVert_{H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)}.$$
  Can we use a scaling argument (or a variation of it) to show that the exponent of $R$ in the right hand side of (1) cannot be different from $1/2$? It is mostly the presence of the inhomogeneous norm
$$\lVert f\rVert_{H^s}^2=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\lvert \hat{f}(\xi)\rvert^2\left( 1+ \lvert \xi\rvert^2\right)^s\, d\xi$$

304216,A Math Olympiad question regarding Geometry,"A little bit of a backstory (you may skip this if you want): My high school math teacher knows that I love math, but he also knows that I usually drift off during my classes, perhaps because it's too easy, perhaps because it's too slow, I don't know why exactly, but I'm sure many frequenters of this site know how it feels. When I drift off I do think about math, but about different things, for example, in my most recent math class in the previous week (we were discussing the basics of integrals, which I already did for fun a few months before) I proved the quadratic equation. My teacher saw I was bored and asked my why I never participated in any Olympiads, and quite frankly I never knew about them (it is now too late for me, this was the final year I was eligible). He gave me the paper for the second round of the Dutch Olympiad and the final problem immediately catched my eye; the paper said that 0% of the participants solved this problem. So, me being me, I disregarded all problems and immediately focused on this one. It took me 20 minutes at most which surprised me, but I can't find the solutions anywhere, so I want to ask if my answer is correct on this site. I'm not quite aware if this is against the rules, I'm new here. The original problem: A flag in the form of an equilateral triangle is connected to the tops of 2 vertical poles. One of the pole has a length of 4 and the other pole has a length of 3. You also know that the third vertex touches the ground perfectly. Calculate the length of a side. Calculators aren't allowed. The following picture was appended: My solution: For some reason I immediately knew how to solve the problem. A picture says a 1000 words: Which leaves us with $$x^2 = 1 + (\sqrt{x^2-16} + \sqrt{x^2-9})^2$$ $$x^2 = 1 + x^2-16 + x^2-9 + 2\sqrt{(x^2-16)(x^2-9)}$$ $$ -x^2 + 24 = 2\sqrt{(x^2-16)(x^2-9)}$$ Then just square, fast forward a couple of extremely messy steps (I could include but I think it is clear) and we get $x = \sqrt{17 \dfrac{1}{3}}$ Questions: Is my answer correct? I know I might have made a mistake in the algebra, but is the main reasoning correct? Why would this problem be considered as hard? I mean if (almost) nobody actually got it, there must be a reason why?

By Maschke's theorem since $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F}_5) \nmid |S_3|$ (i.e. $5\nmid 6$) we know $\mathbb{F}_5[S_3]$ is semisimple so by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem and the fact that the group ring is finite we have $\mathbb{F}_5[S_3]=\Pi_i M_{n_i}(K_i)$ for some fields $K_i$ containing $\mathbb{F}_5$. Now $|\mathbb{F}_5[S_3]|=5^6$ and $\mathbb{F}_5[S_3]$ is noncommutative so we must have at least one $n_i\geq 2$ and we only have room to have $M_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$.

304334,Generalization of Grassmann manifold to include translations?,"I came across a certain generalization of Grassmann manifolds and was wondering what work if any has been done on it.  If you take the space of $n\times p$ real matrices, $n>p$, and define an equivalence relationship $A\sim B \Leftrightarrow \exists M\in GL(p)\mid AM=B$ where $GL(p)$ is the space of invertible $p\times p$ real matrices, then the quotient space defined by this relation is the space of all $p$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$, called the Grassmann manifold $Gr(n,p)$. If you generalize this equivalence relation to also include the addition of a constant to each column: $A\sim B \Leftrightarrow \exists M\in GL(p), x \in \mathbb{R}^p\mid (A1_n)\left(\begin{array}{c}M\\x^T\end{array}\right)=B$ what is the manifold given by the corresponding quotient space?  Does it have a name?  Are there analytic solutions for the geodesics on this manifold, like there are for Grassmann manifolds? This came up while trying to figure out how to maximize Gaussian mutual information under certain constraints.  If you have two data matrices $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times T}$ and $Y\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times T}$, then the empirical Gaussian mutual information between them can be computed as $\hat{I}[X;Y] = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{log}|M_nXX^TM_n^T| - \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{log}|M_nXX^TM_n^T-M_nXY^TM_m^T(M_mYY^TM_m^T)^{-1}M_mYX^TM_n^T|$ where $M_n:=I_n-1_{n\times n}/n$ is the matrix that subtracts the mean from each row of a matrix. This function is invariant under left multiplication of $X$ or $Y$ by an arbitrary matrix in $GL(n)$ or $GL(m)$ respectively, but also under addition of an arbitrary vector in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ to each column.  I'd like to do optimization of this function directly in the quotient space defined by this equivalence relationship, instead of on $\mathbb{R}^{n\times T} \times \mathbb{R}^{m\times T}$, which is precisely the Cartesian product of the manifold I defined above. Edit: I realized my previous comment about this manifold being larger than $Gr(n,p)$ is wrong.  The equivalence relation is more general than the equivalence relation for $Gr(n,p)$, so the manifold is smaller.  It also occurs to me that the construction I described can be given as $GL(n)/(GL(n-p)\times Aff(p)) = GL(n)/(GL(n-p)\times (\mathbb{R}^p \rtimes GL(p)))$ where $Aff(p)$ is the $p$ dimensional affine space.  I believe this is equivalent to $O(n)/(O(n-p)\times(\mathbb{R}^p \rtimes O(p))$ where $O(n)$ is the group of $n$ dimensional orthogonal matrices, since $Gr(n,p)$ can be constructed as $O(n)/(O(n-p)\times O(p))$.","['manifolds', 'linear-algebra', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $T^*M$ be the cotangent bundle of $M$.  The Liouville 1-form $\Theta$ on $T^*M$ is defined as follows.  Let $(x, \omega) \in T^*M_x$ and then let $W$ be in $TT^*M_{(x, \omega)}$.  Then $\Theta_{(x, \omega)} (W) = \omega(d \pi^* (W))$ where $\pi^* : T^*M \into M$ is the projection map.  With this, we can define a 2-form $\Omega$ on $T^*M$ by taking the exterior derivative, $\Omega = -d\Theta$. For a function $H : T^*M \into \rn$, the Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ on the cotangent bundle is the vector field satisfying the property that $dH = \iota_{X_H} \Omega$.  Flows under this vector field represent solutions to the classical Hamiltonian equations under a suitable Hamiltonian function $H$. To switch between Hamiltonian formalism and the Lagrangian formalism, we use the Legendre transform.  Given a map $L : TM \into \rn$, define $\fn L : TM \into T^*M$ by $\fn L(v)(w) = \frac{d}{ds}\big|_{s=0} L(v + sw)$.  We have the corresponding forms on $TM$ given by $\Theta_L = (\fn L)^* \Theta$ and $\Omega_L = (\fn L)^* \Omega$.  $\Theta_L$ is called the Lagrangian 1-form and $\Omega_L$ the Lagrangian 2-form. Then let $X_L$ be a vector field on $TM$ such that $\iota_X \Omega_L = dE$ where the energy $E$ is defined by $E(x,v) = \mathbb{F}L(v)\dot(v) - L(x,v) = \Theta_L(X)(v) - L(v)$ Then the integral curves (I think) of $X_L$ are solutions to the Euler Lagrange equations.  Suppose a curve $v(t) \in TM$ satisfies $v^{(1)}(t) = X(x, v)$.  Then does $v^i(t) = x^{i(1)}(t)$ and $L_x(x, v) - \frac{d}{dt} L_v (x, v) = 0$?

304346,Is it allowed to divide an equation by an expression which can be equal to zero?,"I need a help in such a problem and will greatly appreciate any suggestions. I was taught, division of an equation by an expression which can be equal to zero can lead to missing roots. But I thought that this is not forbidden completely, cause always in such a situation I simply solved additional equation (which was a divider) and checked if its roots are roots of an initial equation. For example: $$
(x + 2)^2 + x + 2 = 0
$$ Dividing this by $( x + 2 )$ gives $$
x + 2 + 1 = 0
$$ so the root is $x = -3$, then I simply check whether the $ x + 2 = 0$ gives a root which fits the initial equation, and it does: $x = -2$. I do not have a great experience in mathematics, but I solved a couple of hundreds of equations more complex than this and never had a trouble. But today I encountered this issue. Here is the equation: $$
3\sin(5z) -2\cos(5z) = 3
$$ I saw that $\cos(5z) = 0$ is the one of the solutions, but I divided all by it and got: $$
\begin{align}
3\tan(5z) - 2 &= 3 \\
3\tan(5z) &= 5 \\
\tan(5z) &= \frac{5}{3} \\
5z &= \arctan(\frac{5}{3}) + \pi k , k \in \mathbb{Z} \\
z &= \frac{\arctan(\frac{5}{3}) + \pi k}{5}, k \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align}
$$ the second root is: $$
\begin{align}
\cos(5z) &= 0 \\
z = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k}{5} &= \frac{\pi (1 + 2 k)}{10}, k \in \mathbb{Z}
\end{align}
$$ But the first one is not a real root for some reason. This was the first thing which confused me here, I knew that I can lose a root but I never found parasite ones in similar situations. I was taught that parasite roots can appear only when doing a multiplication by an expression which can be equal to zero or an exponentiation to an even exponent, not in the cause of a division. The second confusion is the fact that I actually have lost some roots, cause the right solution from the textbook was (with the introduction of the so called auxiliary angle $\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13} \implies \gamma = \arcsin(\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}})$): $$
\begin{align}
\underbrace{\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}}_{\sin(\gamma)} \ sin(5z) - \underbrace{\frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}}_{\cos(\gamma)} \ cos(5z) &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\
\sin(\gamma)\sin(5z) - \cos(\gamma)\cos(5z) &= \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\
\cos(\gamma + 5z) &= -\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}} \\
z &= \pm \frac{1}{5}\arccos(-\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}) - \frac{1}{5}\arcsin(\frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}) + \frac{2\pi k}{5}
\end{align}
$$ So I actually have two questions: Is it possible to lose roots permanently when dividing an equation by an expression which may be equal to zero ? Is it possible to gain parasite roots in such a case? Or in which situations they can appear in general, not only concerning division? Thanks.","['trigonometry', 'self-learning', 'divisibility']"

I can do the first two, but can't finish the third. I can include the proofs to the first two if they are wanted. Suppose that $p\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, $\chi$ is a character of order $4$, and $\rho$ is a character of order $2$. Let $N$ be the number of solutions to $x^4+y^4=1$ in $F_p$. Show that $N=p+1-\delta_4(-1)4+2\mathrm{Re} J(\chi,\chi)+4\mathrm{Re} J(\chi,\rho)$. (Here $J$ is the Jacobi sum, and $\delta_4(-1)$ is $1$ is $-1$ is a fourth power, and $0$ otherwise.) (Solved.) By Exercise 7, $J(\chi,\chi)=\chi(-1)J(\chi,\rho)$. Let $\pi=-J(\chi,\rho)$. Show that $N=p-3-6\mathrm{Re}\pi$ if $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ and $N=p+1-2\mathrm{Re}\pi$ if $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$. (Solved.) Let $\pi=a+bi$. One can show (See Chapter 11, Section 5) that $a$ is odd, $b$ is even, and $a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ if $4\mid b$ and $a\equiv -1\pmod{4}$ if $4\nmid b$. Let $p=A^2+B^2$ and fix $A$ by requiring that $A\equiv 1\pmod{4}$. Then show that $N=p-3-6A$ if $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ and $N=p+1+2A$ if $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$. My thoughts so far: I know I can also express $\pi=-J(\chi,\rho)=-\chi(-1)J(\chi,\chi)$. I see that $\pi\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$, and that $\Re(\pi)^2+\Im(\pi)^2=|\pi|^2=|-\chi(-1)J(\chi,\chi)|^2=p$. So I can express 
$$
p=A^2+B^2=\Re(\pi)^2+\Im(\pi)^2.
$$
If I fix $A$ by requiring that $A\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, is there a way to conclude that $A=\Re(\pi)$ when $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ and $A=-\Re(\pi)$ when $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ to get the desired result? I believe if $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ implies $4\mid b$, then $a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, i.e., $A=\Re(\pi)$, and if $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ implies $b\nmid 4$, then $a\equiv -1\pmod{4}$, or $-a\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, i.e., $-\Re(\pi)=A$, which is precisely what I want, but don't see how to get there. If it's any help, I know that $-1$ is a fourth power iff $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$, which tells me $\pi=-J(\chi,\chi)$ when $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$, and $\pi=J(\chi,\chi)$ when $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$. Then $|J(\chi,\chi)|=\Re(J)^2+\Im(J)^2=p$, but $\Re(\pi)=-\Re(J)$ when $p\equiv 1\pmod{8}$ and $\Re(\pi)=\Re(J)$ when $p\equiv 5\pmod{8}$, which gives me the opposite sign of what I want.

However, if I treat this as a curve along the real axis on the Riemann sphere (since the function is zero at infinity), then I can consider the interior of the curve to be the upper-half of the complex plane where it has a single singularity of order $1$ at $i$.  Thus, applying the residue theorem, I obtain: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x}{x^2+1}dx = 2\pi i\lim_{x\rightarrow i}(x-i)\frac{x}{(x-i)(x+i)} = 2\pi i\frac{i}{2i} = \pi i\neq 0.$$ Clearly I'm doing something wrong, can someone explain to me my misconception(s)?

formula 1  says
$$ \lim_{x\to a }\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
and the second says 
$$ \lim_{h\to 0 }\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$$ so i tried to use formula 2 to solve this problem FIND The equation of the tangent line to the curve at the given point. $$ \sqrt{x},$$ $$ (1,1)$$ step - 1
$$ \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}$$
step -2
 $$\frac{\sqrt{1+h} - 1}{h}$$
step -3 used the conjugate pair to come up with 
$$\frac{\sqrt{1+h} - 1}{h} * \frac{\sqrt{1+h} + 1}{\sqrt{1+h} + 1} $$
step -4
the result of the above i would end up with 
$$ \frac{1+h-1}{h\sqrt{1+h}}$$
step 5
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+0}} = 1$$ however the answer is $ \frac{1}{2}$ i cant see what I'm doing wrong and when should i use the first formula and when do i use the second formula? any help in answering this question would be most appreciated.

In this case, $$f(z) = \frac{\mathrm{csch}{[(2 z+1) \pi]}}{2 z+1}$$ There is a pole of order $1$ at $z=-1/2$.  Note that is is not of order $2$ because $\cot{z} \sim (\pi/2) - z$ as $z \rightarrow \pi/2$.  One may then compute the single residue of $\pi \cot{\pi z} f(z)$ as $$\mathrm{Res}_{z=z_k} \left [\pi \cot{\pi z} \: \frac{\mathrm{csch}{[(2 z+1) \pi]}}{2 z+1} \right ] = -\frac{\pi}{4} $$ So I get as a value for the posted series as $\pi/8$, which is not correct.

There is a part of the definition that I do not understand: Let $V$ be a real vector space of dimension $n$. An orientation of $V$ is a choice of component of $\Lambda^n V-\{0\}$. [...] Let $O$ be the ""0-section"" of the exterior n-bundle $\Lambda^n M^*$; that is, \begin{equation}
O = \bigcup_{p \in M} \{0 \in \Lambda^n T^*_p M\}
\end{equation} Then since $\Lambda^n T^*_p M - \{0\}$ has exactly two components, it follows that  $\Lambda^n T^*M - O$ has at most two components. Why do they say that there are two components ? Why not just one ? On a 3-manifold, for example, $dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3$ is a component, what would the other one be, $- dx_1 \wedge dx_2 \wedge dx_3$ ?","['differential-forms', 'differential-geometry']"
304860,Can someone help me with this formula?,"I'm writing a software algorithm at the moment which compares survey answers. Questions have $5$ possible answers, and a respondent could choose between 1 and 5 answers. What I'd like to do, for each respondent, for each question, is calculate how strongly they feel about their answer. I propose to do this by counting the number of answers they selected. For example, suppose the question was: Which of these colours do you like? And the possible answers were: a) Blue
b) Red
c) Green
d) Orange
e) Purple Then someone who answers only b), feels more strongly about their answer than someone who selected all 5. What I'm having trouble with, is how to account for the different numbers of possible answers.  If a question has a yes or no answer, and the respondent only chooses one answer, we want to consider this as being less significant than if they only choose one answer on a question with more possible options. So the more options to choose from, the higher the importance of each answer selected. So far, I've come up with this: $$i = \text{max} - (\frac{g}{n} * \text{max})$$ Where: $i$ (importance) max (maximum importance %) $= 100$ $p$ (possible answers) $g$ (given answers) Can anybody suggest how I could approach this problem differently or improve the formula?

304875,counterexample for: integral forms that are equivalent as rational forms are also equivalent as integral forms,"I have the feeling that I'm missing something very obvious: I'm looking for a counterexmple for the following statement for some $n>1$ (it is trivially true for $n=1$): Let $A,B\in\mathbb Z^{n\times n}$ symmetric with determinant $\pm 1$ such that there exists an invertible matrix $C\in\mathbb Q^{n\times n}$ with $C^{-1}AC=B$. Then there exists $S\in\mathbb Z^{n\times n}$ with determinant $\pm 1$ such that $S^{-1}AS=B$. The motivation behind it is that I want to give an example for two quadratic integral forms of discriminant $\pm 1$ that are not equivalent as integral forms but as rational forms. This then gives that the notion of integral form equivalence is ""finer"" than that of rational form equivalence (a statement from Serre's book ""A course in arithmetic"" Chapter 5, 1.1). It may also be that my approach is clumsy, then I would be very thankful for inspiration for a different one.","['matrices', 'quadratic-forms']"

I can't find any way of proving it, nor can I think of a counterexample. The question was motivated by the fact that many books prove that the Killing form on a Lie algebra is $ad$-invariant by stating that it's obviously $Ad$-invariant.
