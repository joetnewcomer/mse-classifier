2408959,Proof that the real vector space of $C^\infty$ functions with $f''(x) + f(x) = 0$ is two-dimensional,"Prove that the real vector space of $C^\infty$ functions $f$ such that $$f''(x) + f(x) = 0$$ is two-dimensional. I feel like there must be an obvious answer to this question, but I don't know what it is. In particular, I can see that $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ are linearly independent, but how do I know that they span the space? If we restrict the problem to analytic functions, then two-dimensionality is easy: once you know the values of $f(0)$ and $f'(0)$ , the rest of the Maclaurin series follows from the identity $f^{(n+2)}(0) = -f^{(n)}(0)$ for all $n$ . But how do we know there are no non-analytic solutions? Before you ask: this isn't quite a homework question. I'm going to present this example as an algebra TA, and I'd like some confidence that my answer is actually rue.","['real-analysis', 'linear-transformations', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'linear-algebra', 'vector-spaces']"
2408970,Preparing a lecture on free probability [closed],"Closed. This question is off-topic . It is not currently accepting answers. Closed 6 years ago . This question is not about mathematics, within the scope defined in the help center . This question is missing context or other details : Please improve the question by providing additional context, which ideally includes your thoughts on the problem and any attempts you have made to solve it. This information helps others identify where you have difficulties and helps them write answers appropriate to your experience level. Improve this question I am required to prepare a 1 hr long lecture on interesting topic(s) in free probability theory. My audience is supposed to be thorough with classical probability and statistics, without any prior knowledge on free probability. In fact, I will be sort of introducing free probability to them. Now, the rules are as follows: 1) I should not give a very technical talk. The lecture should invite people into free probability, not scare them away. 2) I should not give detailed proofs, and if required, only sketches. 3) I should highlight connections between free probability with different branches of mathematics, physics, etc. Any suggestion is welcome. EDIT: My idea is as follows: First I will give the abstract operator theoretic definition, and then mention that in such an abstract setting, distributions do not really make sense. There is no distribution function. So we define distribution in a roundabout way: borrowing from physics, we define a linear functional, a trace, based on which we talk about distribution. We then define free random variables using the conventional lattice theory (existence of Mobius function) and zero cumulants. Then I will talk about free Gaussian distribution. So I can introduce the subject, but I am looking for connections, examples and applications. Please help me in this regard.","['reference-request', 'probability-theory', 'soft-question']"

Hence, $$ z_0 \in \sigma(T) \Rightarrow z = z(\overline{z_0}z_0) (z\overline{z_0})z_0 \in  z\overline{z_0}\sigma(T) = \sigma(T) \Rightarrow S^1\subset \sigma(T).$$ Help?","['functional-analysis', 'operator-theory']"
2409283,Multivariable Piecewise continuous function on a compact set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$,"In optimal control and differential equations we often deal with piecewise continuous functions. Here I want to extend the piecewise continuous function from an interval
in $\mathbb{R}$ to a compact set in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for which I
think there should be a standard definition. But I searched online
for a long time, yet still could not find one. Recall that a one-variable piecewise continuous function is defined
as: A real-valued function $u(t)$, $t_{0}\le t\le t_{f}$ , is said to
be piecewise continuous, denoted $u\in\hat{C}[t_{0},t_{f}]$, if there
is a finite (irreducible) partition $t_{0}=\theta_{0}<\theta_{1}<\cdot\cdot\cdot<\theta_{N}<\theta_{N+1}=t_{f}$
such that $u$ may be regarded as a continuous function in $[\theta_{k},\theta_{k+1}]$
for each $k=0,1,...,N$. So my question is if I can define a multi-variable piecewise continuous
function on a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as follows: A real-valued function $u(x)$, $x\in E$ is said to be piecewise
continuous if there is a finite partition of $E$ on each coordinate
such that $u$ may be regarded as a continuous function on each polytope. The source of the question is from the book of Chachuat: Nonlinear
and Dynamic Optimization, in theorem A.55 on page xv of appendix A.5:
""Suppose that $f(t,x,p)$ is piecewise continuous in $(t,x,p)$..."",
so $f(t,x,p)$ is multivariate piecewise continuous function but Chachuat
does not give the explicit definition.","['real-analysis', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'optimal-control']"

By substituting $x\mapsto x^b$, we get $$\int\frac{bx^{b-1}}{1+x^a}~dx$$ Thus, the given integral in question is really $$\int\frac{x^b}{1+x^a}~dx$$ By expanding with the geometric series and termwise integration, one can see that $$\int_0^p\frac{x^b}{1+x^a}~dx=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^kp^{ak+b+1}}{ak+b+1}=\frac{p^{b+1}}a\Phi\left(-p^a,1,\frac{b+1}a\right)$$ where $\Phi$ is the Lerch transcendent . A few particular cases that arise may be found: \begin{align}\int\frac1{1+x^{1/n}}~dx&=C+(-1)^{n+1}n\left[\ln(1+x^{1/n})+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}\frac{(-x^{1/n})^k}k\right],&a=1\\\int\frac1{1+x^{2/n}}~dx&=C+(-1)^nn\left[\arctan(x^{1/n})+\frac1{x^{1/n}}\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2}\frac{(-x^{2/n})^k}{2k-1}\right],&a=2,n\ne2b\end{align} Or, more generally, with $x=t^{an+1}$, $$\int\frac1{1+x^{a/(an+1)}}~dx=(-1)^{n+a}(an+1)\left[\int\frac1{1+t^a}~dt+\frac1{x^{(a-1)/(an+1)}}\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/a}\frac{(-x^{a/(an+1)})^k}{a(k-1)+1}\right]$$ which reduces down to the previously solved problem.

2409329,Totally positive unit a square?,"Let $ \mathcal{O}$ be an order in a totally real number field $E$, then $( \mathcal{O},q_1 )$ is an integral lattice with its natural  quadratic form $q_1(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)$ (which is positive definite). Also, if $u$ is a totally positive unit in $ \mathcal{O}$, then the form $ q_2(x):=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \,x^2)$ give us another positive definite lattice $( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$. When $u$ is a square unit, say $u=v^2$, this lattices are actually isometric by the map $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$ given by $x \mapsto v^{-1} x$. Now, I've been trying (for a while) to deal with the reciprocal question, i.e., If there exists an isometry $\phi:( \mathcal{O},q_1 )\rightarrow( \mathcal{O},q_2 )$, then must $u$ be a square ?. So far all I've been able to say is that if exist $\kappa \in \mathcal{O}$ such that $\phi(x)=\kappa \, x$  for all $x\in \mathcal{O} $, then $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(x^2)=\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}(u \, \kappa^2 x^2)$ implies $\text{tr}_{E/\mathbb{Q}}((1-u \, \kappa^2) x^2)=0 \,\, \forall x \in \mathcal{O} $,  but then $1-u \, \kappa^2$ would be  $q_1-$orthogonal to all $\mathcal{O}$ and therefore $u=\kappa^{-2}$, however I have no idea how to prove (or if it is even possible to prove) that $\phi$ must be of this form for some $\kappa$. I'm especially interested  in the case  where $E$ is an $S_3$ cubic field (its normal closure has Galois group $S_3$). I haven't been able to find any counterexamples in this setting, I'd be more than grateful if someone could give some idea of how to find one. I also would like to know if there are some reference where to find things related to this sort of problems. Thanks in advance!. Update: Although quadratic fields it's not my purpose I realized that there at least two $n$  for which the question is false for the quadratic field $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ and  maximal order $\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{O}_E$. These are $n=3,7$ with nonsquare units $u$ equal to  $2+\sqrt{3}$ and $8+3\sqrt{7}$ respectively. Indeed, the Gramm matrix of $q_i$ ($i=1,2$) always have determinant equal to $\text{disc}(\mathcal{O})$, thus $\frac{1}{2}q_i$ is a primitive form of discriminant $-4 n$ in both cases, and thefore it correspond to an ideal class in the order $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ of conductor $2$ in $\mathcal{O_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-n})}}$, but since in both cases the class number $h\left(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]\right)=1$, we have that $\frac{1}{2}q_1$ and $\frac{1}{2}q_2$ are equivalent and therefore $q_1$ and $q_2$  isometric. These are actually the only cases in which we can use the ""class number 1 trick"", because none the other quadratic orders of class number 1  works. Could we do something similar for cubic fields?. Edit : I made a mistake in the last update, even though the forms I mentioned do have discrimiant $-4 n$ not all of them are primitive which make the argument invalid. In fact, for this forms is true that isometry implies the unit is a squre (It's enough to note that the form asociated to the fundamental unit it's not equivalent to $2(x^2+n y^2)$ ). So, the matter is still open even for quadratic fields. Update 2: I'm going to try to focus in one case, give some examples, present some evidence and make the statement more elementary as @reuns suggest. Let's focus in the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{n})$ with $n$ a positive square free integer  $n \equiv 3 \,\text{mod} \, 4$, and its maximal order $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{n}]$. Acording to A031396 all of this fields will have totally positive fundamental units (because if $a^2-n b^2=-1$  is soluble and $n$ is odd then $ n\equiv 1 \,\text{mod} \, 4$). So let $u=a+b\sqrt{n}>1$ with $a^2-n b^2=1$ be the fundamental unit, the Gramm matrix of the form we asociate to $u$ and to $1$ in the basis $\{1 , \sqrt{n} \}$ are repectively $\left[\begin{array}{cc}\text{tr}(u )  & \text{tr}(u\sqrt{n} ) \\\text{tr}(u \sqrt{n})  & \text{tr}(u\, n ) \end{array}\right]=2 \, \left[\begin{array}{cc}a & n b\\ n b & n a\end{array}\right] \,$ and $ \,\left[\begin{array}{cc}\text{tr}(1 )  & \text{tr}(\sqrt{n} ) \\\text{tr}(\sqrt{n})  & \text{tr}(\, n ) \end{array}\right]=2 \, \left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\ 0 & n \end{array}\right].$ now since, as noted in the begining, the forms associated to square units are isometric to the associated to $1$, there will be a nonsquare unit with form equivalent to $q_1$ iff this two forms are isometric (that's why I say it's enough to check for the fundamental unit). When $a$ is even (for example for $n=3$ and $n=7$ with  $u=2+\sqrt{3}$ and $u=8+3\sqrt{7}$ respectively), the forms are non even equivalent over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ( because mod 4 one is $\left[\begin{array}{cc}0 & 2\\ 2 & 0 \end{array}\right]$ and the other $\left[\begin{array}{cc}2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$ ). So the more interesting case would be when $a$ is odd (for example for $n=39$ with $u=25+4\sqrt{39}$), in this case both $\frac{1}{2}q_1=x^2+n y^2$ and $\frac{1}{2}q_2=a x^2+2 b n \, xy+ n a \, y^2$ are primitive forms of discriminant $-4n$. And the question could be rephrased as Is it possible for $a x^2+2 b n \, xy+ n a \, y^2$  to be equivalent to $x^2+n y^2$? Or in the language of ideals in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-n}]$ Is it possible for the ideal  $\langle a, -b n+\sqrt{-n} \rangle_{\mathbb{Z}}$  to be principal?

2409392,Prove that a surface of revolution is regular surface.,"Considering the following definitions extracted of do Carmo's book Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces, prove that a surface of revolution is regular surface . Def. 1: A parametrized differentiable curve is a differentiable ($C^\infty$) map $\alpha:I\to\mathbb R^3$ of an open interval $I$ of $\mathbb R$ into $\mathbb R^3$. $\alpha$ is said to be regular if $\alpha'(t)\neq 0$ for all $t\in I$. Def. 2: A subset $S\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is a regular surface if, for each $p\in S$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a map $\mathbf{x}: U\to V\cap S$ of an open set $U\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ onto $V\cap S\subset \mathbb R^3$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ is differentiable; $\mathbf{x}$ is a homeomorphism; For each $q\in U$, the differential $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^3$ is one-to-one. Def. 3: A surface of revolution is a set $S\subset \mathbb R^3$ obtained by rotating a regular  connected plane curve $C$ about an axis in the plane which does not meet the curve. do Carmo's considerations: Considering the $xz$ plane as the plane of the curve and $z$ axis as the rotation axis, let $$ x=f(v), z=g(v), a<v<b, f(v)>0,$$ be a parametrization for $C$ and denote by $u$ the rotation angle about the $z$ axis. Thus, we obtain a map $$\mathbf x(u,v)=(f(v)\cos u, f(v)\sin u, g(v))$$ from the open set $U=\{(u,v)\in\mathbb R^2; 0<u<2\pi, a<v<b\}$ into $S$. To show that $\mathbf x$ is a parametrization of $S$ we must check conditions 1, 2 and 3 of Def. 2. My attempt solution: Since $U$ is an open set of $\mathbb R^2$ and $\mathbf x(U)=S$, then for all $p\in S$ there exist $q\in U$ such that $\mathbf x(q)=p.$ $\mathbf x$ is differentiable because is differentiable each coordinate function of $\mathbf x$, for all $q\in U$; $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q$ is one-to-one because $$\mathrm d\mathbf x_q=\begin{bmatrix}
-f(v)\sin u & f'(v)\cos u\\ 
f(v)\cos u &f'(v)\sin u \\ 
0 & g'(v)
\end{bmatrix},$$ so $$\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}=-f'(v)f(v)$$ and $$\frac{\partial(y,z)}{\partial(u,v)}=g'(v)\cos u.$$ Therefore $\mathrm d\mathbf x_q$ is one-to-one, because $C$ is regular [$(f'(v))^2+(g'(v))^2\neq 0$] . $\mathbf x$ is continuous  because the coordinates functions are continuous. To show injectivity, let $(u,v),(z,w)\in U$ be such that $\mathbf x(u,v)=\mathbf x(z,w)$. Then $$\begin{cases}f(v)\cos u=f(w)\cos z\\ f(v)\sin u=f(w)\sin z\\ g(v)=g(w)\end{cases}.$$ So we have $(f(v))^2=(f(w))^2$, that implies $f(v)=f(w)$ since $f(v), f(w)>0$. Therefore $$\begin{cases}\cos u=\cos z\\ \sin u=\sin z\end{cases}\implies u=z.$$ But I can't show that $v=w$. I got stuck here.

2409446,Understanding the behavior of a smoothed notion of perimeter for general measurable sets.,"The Question: Let $f\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ be a smooth function with compact support satisfying $\int f =0$, and define $f_r(x) = r^{-1} f(x/r)$.  One can show that, when $E\subset [0,1]$ is a measurable set with finite perimeter, that 
$$
P(E) = C \lim_{r\to 0^+} r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2
$$
where the constant $C$ depends on the function $f$.  Here $1_E$ is the indicator function of $E$. To get intuition about this formula, observe that the convolution is zero deep in the interior or exterior of $E$, and only nonzero in a strip of width approximately $r$ on the boundary of $E$.  Thus the norm captures how much mass is near the boundary, in a smoothed way. My question is what happens when $E$ does not necessarily have finite perimeter. Is it true that $\lim_{r\to 0^+}r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2 = \infty$ when $P(E) = \infty$? It turns out to be tricky, since we do not have a nice structure theorem for such sets, and in particular there does not have to exist a scale $r$ at which the behavior of the convolution ""settles"" into something understandable. A Reduction If $E\subset [0,1]$ has infinite perimeter, one can find disjoint intervals $I_1,\ldots,I_N$ in $[0,1]$ such that $0 < |I_k\cap E| < |I_k|$ for all $k$.  Throwing away at most half, we can assume that the intervals are separated (none share endpoints).  Since we can do this for any $N$ and using a simple rescaling argument, it suffices to prove the following statement: Does there exist a constant $c>0$ such that the following holds: For any measurable set $E\subset [0,1]$ with $0<|E|<1$, 
  $$
\lim_{r\to 0^+} r^{-1}\|f_r\ast E\|_{L^2}^2 > c?$$ If we want we can even assume above that $P(E) = \infty$, though I'm not sure whether that helps.  Notice that this is easy to prove when $E$ is also assumed to have finite perimeter, oddly the infinite perimeter case is what is difficult! A Potentially useful formula Expanding the convolution and the square, using the fact that $\int f = 0$, and applying a change of coordinates, one can show that 
$$
r^{-1}\|f_r\ast 1_E\|_{L^2}^2 = -\frac{1}{2r}\int |E\Delta (E+rt)| g(t)\,dt
$$
where 
$$
g(t) = \int f(y) f(y+t)\,dy.
$$
From the definition one has that $\max |g| = |g(0)| = \|f\|_{L^2}^2$, and 
$\int g = 0$.  I can expand on the derivation of this formula if desired, though it is worth noting that the manipulations are largely the same as in this question I asked a few years ago which was motivated by the same problem. It is also possible to express this formula using the Fourier transform, but I haven't been able to get anything from this approach that is not already contained above.  Perhaps however if I had a different way to understand $\widehat{1_E}(\xi)$ I could make more progress. Final Thoughts While I am writing this I realize that perhaps this question is more appropriate for MathOverflow as it is a question that came up in research and I'm not sure that it has a known answer.  Please let me know if this is the case.  In the meantime I'd be very happy to see either a counterexample or any other angle of attack.

2409976,"Sum of squares, confusion along the way in getting the formula.","See pages 4-5 of these notes here on calculus by Nets Katz. Before leaving Gauss' proof, let us at least examine how it generalizes to sums of squares. Let us consider $$S_2(n) = 1 + 4 + \ldots + n^2 = \sum_{j = 1}^n j^2.$$ In order to calculate this sum, a la Gauss, it helps to have a geometric notion of the number $j^2$ . It is in fact the number of pairs of natural numbers less than or equal to $j$ . In set theoretic notation $$j^2 = \#\{(l, m): l, m \in \mathbb{N},\,l,m \le j\}.$$ Thus we can write $S_2(n)$ as the number of elements of  a set of triples. Basically we use the third component of the triple to write down which term of the sum the ordered triple belongs to. $$S_2(n) = \#\{(j, l, m) : j, l, m \in \mathbb{N},\,l, m\le j,\, j \le n\}.$$ Thus the number we seek, $S_2(n)$ is the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ , so that the first component is greater than or equal to the last two components. Gauss' trick generalizes to the following observation. For any ordered triple, one of the components is at least as big as the other $2$ . This suggests we should compare $3$ copies of $S_2(n)$ to $n^3$ which is the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ . But we have to be careful, we are counting triples where there are two components larger than the third twice and we are counting triples where all three components are equal three times. Now observe that the number of triples of natural numbers less than or equal to $n$ with all components equal, formally $$\#\{(j, j, j) : j \in \mathbb{N},\,j \le n\}$$ is just equal to $n$ , the number of choices for $j$ . It is also easy to count triples that have the first two components large and the third smaller. We observe that $$\#\{(j, j, l) : j, l \in \mathbb{N},\,j \le n,\,l \le j\} = S_1(n).$$ We get this because for each $j$ there are $j$ choices of $l$ , so we are summing the first $n$ numbers. Then like Gauss we observe that each triple with two equal components at least as the third, has the third component somewhere. Combining all these observations we can conclude that $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n.$$ (Basically the first term correctly counts triples with all different components. The first term double counts triples with two equal components and one unequal
but the second term subtracts one copy of each of these. The first term
triple counts triples with all components the same, but the second term also
triple counts them, so we have to add $n$ to correctly account for all triples.) Question. It's still not clear to me at all how we got $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n.$$ I understand to some extent how we got the $3$ in front of the $S_2(n)$ , but it's not clear to me at all how the $3$ in front of the $S_1(n)$ popped up and why we're adding an $n$ . Sure, the parenthetical in the notes following the expression $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n$$ sort of gives an explanation, but it doesn't really let me know why we end up getting $3$ , $-3$ , and $1$ as the specific coefficients in front of the $S_k(n)$ . Certainly the inclusion-exclusion principle is lurking around here, but I suffer from a lack of combinatorial skill, and the inclusion-exclusion principle hasn't been introduced by this point in the notes, much less proved. So could anyone add some more details, more intuition as to how they might come up $$n^3 = 3S_2(n) - 3S_1(n) + n?$$ Thank you! Update. John Griffin gave a very excellent answer, and I'm still trying to digest it. But is there a way of phrasing what he said in terms of the framework of the inclusion-exclusion principle?

2410268,Relationship between Principal Unitary Bundles and Complex Vector Bundles,"I'm trying to prove that principal $U(N)$-bundles are in bijective correspondence to complex vector bundles. I understand the proof that principal $\text{GL}(N, \mathbb{R})$-bundles are equivalent to real vector bundles.  Given a principal $\text{GL}(N, \mathbb{R})$-bundle $P$ on a base $X$, use the defining representation of $\text{GL}(N, \mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to define an associated real vector bundle $E$ on $X$.  Conversely, the frame bundle recovers the original principal bundle. Obviously, a similar argument holds in the complex case.  Now, let $P$ be a principal $U(N)$-bundle on $X$.  I can use the defining representation of $U(N)$ on $\mathbb{C}^{N}$ to get an associated complex vector bundle with structure group $U(N)$.  Conversely, let $E$ be a complex vector bundle on $X$.  I think the key is that every complex vector bundle admits a Hermitian metric which reduces the structure group from $\text{GL}(N, \mathbb{C})$ to $U(N)$.  One can then take the frame bundle which will recover the original principal $U(N)$-bundle. What I'm confused about is that a complex vector bundle may admit many Hermitian metrics, I believe.  Do these all give rise to the same principal unitary frame bundle? A second related question concerns connections and curvature two-forms.  Let $P$ be a principal $U(N)$-bundle and $A$ a connection on $P$ with curvature two-form $F_{A}$.  The connection is a Lie algebra-valued one-form and $F_{A} \in \Omega(X, adP)$ is a two-form valued in the real vector space $adP$. Let $E$ be a complex vector bundle equivalent to $P$ under the correspondence described above.  Let $\nabla$ be a connection on $E$ with curvature two-form $F_{\nabla}$.  We have $F_{\nabla} \in \Omega(X, \text{End}E)$.  By the excellent answer to Principal Bundles, Chern Classes, and Abelian Instantons we should have $F_{A} = F_{\nabla}$.  In particular, they determine the same Chern classes. But I'm confused about the relation between the real vector bundle $adP$ and the complex vector bundle $\text{End}E$.  Do we have $\text{End}E \cong adP \otimes \mathbb{C}$?  Where of course, $E$ and $P$ are equivalent via the above correspondence.  To reiterate, the source of my confusion is $F_{\nabla} \in \Omega(X, \text{End}E)$ and $F_{A} \in \Omega(X, adP)$, with $F_{A} = F_{\nabla}$.","['algebraic-topology', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

2410487,Picking first or picking last,"We've had quite a debate in our family regarding this one. Five guys want to share a house with five bedrooms.  Room 5 is smaller than the rest and no one wants to pick it.  To decide which room they get, they put five pieces of paper in a bag, labelled rooms 1 to 5. One at a time, each guy puts a hand in the bag and pulls one piece of paper. They reveal which room they got after each pull from the bag. The last guy to pull gets the last sheet of paper. The debate in our family is around the odds of picking room 5.  We all agree, at the beginning of the selection process, that it is 20% (1 in 5).  But after the first sheet is pulled and it is not room 5, the remaining odds for picking room 5 rise to 1 in 4.  Then if room 5 is not selected again, the odds rise to 1 in 3 then the 4th person has odds of 1 in 2 = 50%. One member of our family insisted that the strategy should be to pick first (or earliest possible) to keep the odds lowest that room 5 would be picked.  We contrasted this with a scenario where each guy pulled their sheet but no one revealed until all sheets were picked.  Clearly the odds would be 20% for each person. Meanwhile, another argument presented in our family is that if you pick first there is a 20% chance of picking room 5 and an 80% chance of picking any of the other rooms. However if you get the last slip of paper there is also an 80% chance that it will have already been picked, thereby giving the last person a 20% chance of getting room 5 as well.  So the question to this community is: when the picks are revealed as they occur, is there any benefit or advantage to picking first or last?

y^3&=|y|\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)\cos(\phi_3)\\
y^4&=|y|\sin(\phi_1)\sin(\phi_2)\sin(\phi_3),\\
\end{align} where $\phi_1,\phi_2$  range over $[0,\pi]$ while $\phi_3$ ranges over $[0,2\pi]$. [Notation: superscripts denote components of Cartesian 4-vector--i.e. $y=(y^1,y^2,y^3,y^4)$] Choosing to orient our axes such that $\phi_3$ coincides with the angle between the 4-vectors $y$ and $x_1-x_2$ allows us to write \eqref{2} as \begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_L(\sigma)&= \int_0^L d|y|\,|y|^3 \int_{S^3} d\Omega_3 \frac{1}{(|y|^2-2|y|\sigma \cos{\phi_3}+\sigma^2)|y|^2}\\
&=\pi \int_0^L d|y| \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi_3 \frac{|y|}{|y|^2-2|y|\sigma \cos{\phi_3}+\sigma^2}, \label{3}\tag{3}\\
\end{align}
where I define the shorthand $\sigma\equiv |x_1-x_2|$. Now, the angular part of the integral in \eqref{3} looks like a good candidate for a calculus of residues approach, so I take $z=e^{i\phi}$ and find \begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_L(\sigma)&=\pi i \int_0^L d|y| \oint_{|z|=1}dz \frac{|y| }{(|y|z-\sigma)(\sigma z-|y|)}\\
&=\frac{\pi i}{\sigma}\int_0^L d|y|\oint_{|z|=1}dz\frac{1}{(z-\sigma/|y|)(z-|y|/\sigma)}.\label{4}\tag{4}\\
\end{align} Using the residue theorem, I find \begin{align}
\oint_{|z|=1}dz\frac{dz}{(z-\sigma/|y|)(z-|y|/\sigma)}=2\pi i \frac{\sigma |y|}{|y|^2-\sigma^2}\left\{ \theta (\sigma-|y|)-\theta (|y|-\sigma)\right\}, \tag{5}\label{5}
\end{align} where $\theta(x>0)=1$ and $\theta(x)=0$ otherwise. Plugging \eqref{5} into \eqref{4}, yields \begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_L(\sigma)=-2\pi^2\int_0^L d|y|\frac{|y|}{|y|^2-\sigma^2}\left\{ \theta (\sigma-|y|)-\theta (|y|-\sigma)\right\} \label{*} \tag{*}
\end{align} Confusion/Contradiction: For $L<\sigma$, \eqref{*} does seem to give a convergent result:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_{L<\sigma}(\sigma)=-\pi^2 \ln\left[1-L^2/\sigma^2\right].\\
\end{align}
[Recall: I have defined the shorthand $\sigma\equiv |x_1-x_2|$] However, for $L\ge\sigma$, $\eqref{*}$ seems to diverge which contradicts the obvious convergence of $\eqref{1}$. More explicitly, for $L\ge\sigma$, the integral \eqref{*} naturally splits into 2 parts: \begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_L(\sigma)&=-2\pi^2\left[ \int_0^\sigma-\int_\sigma^L\right] d|y|\frac{|y|}{|y|^2-\sigma^2}\\
&=-\pi^2 \left[ \ln{(|y|^2-\sigma^2)}\right]^\sigma_0+\pi^2\left[\ln{(|y|^2-\sigma^2)}\right]^L_\sigma\\
&\sim -\infty\\
\end{align} Edit: (elaboration on H.H.Rugh's answer) As correctly pointed out by H.H.Rugh below, $\phi_3$ cannot be chosen to coincide with the angle between $y$ and $x_1-x_2$.  The nature of my mistake can be easily visualized in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, where it is conventional to choose one angle $\phi:[0,2\pi]$ to denote rotations in the ""$x,y$""-plane around the ""$z$-axis"" and one angle $\theta:[0,\pi]$ to denote rotations away from the $z$-axis as follows: \begin{align}
x&=r \sin\theta \cos\phi\\
y&=r \sin\theta \sin\phi\\
z&=r \cos\theta,\\
\end{align}
where $r^2=x^2+y^2+z^2$. Clearly the $\theta$-component of an arbitrary 3-vector in spherical coordinates, $(r,\phi,\theta)$ coincides with the angle between that 3-vector and one lying along the $z$-axis.  However, the $\phi$-component of that same arbitrary 3-vector does not necessarily coincide with the angle between that 3-vector and one lying along the $x$ or $y$-axis.  This is analogous to my mistake of choosing $\phi_3$ to coincide with the angle between the 4-vectors $y$ and $x_1-x_2$. For completeness, I also explicitly finish the computation started by H.H.Rugh, beginning with \begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_L(\sigma)&= 2\pi \int_0^L dr \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi  \frac{r \sin^2 \phi}{r^2 - 2 r \sigma \cos \phi_1 + \sigma^2 } \\
&=\frac{i\pi}{2\sigma}\int_0^L dr \oint_{z=1} dz \frac{(z^2-1)^2}{z^2(z-\sigma/r)(z-r/\sigma)}\\
\end{align} There is now an additional relevant residue at $z=0$.  Applying the residue theorem, I find $$
\mathcal{I}_{L}(\sigma)=
\begin{cases}
\pi^2 L^2/\sigma^2 & \text{if } L<\sigma  \\
\pi^2 \left(1+\ln(L^2/\sigma)\right) & \text{if } L\ge \sigma\\
\end{cases}

2410827,Is the definition of conditional probability misleading,"I am learning probability and statistics from the book Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis, 3rd Edition by Rice. However just couple pages reading I think his definition on conditional probability is incomplete and misleading. Notice that function P only takes subset of Ω, nothing else. Now here is his definition on conditional probability: The problem is that the P in left is not the same P as in right. Firstly lets ask what is A|B. If A|B is a subset of Ω, then what is the exact components of that? Its awkward to assign anythings into it because really you can't if you use the old P. P on Ω is fundamentally updated by knowing that B is true. So in old P P(B)=something, in new P P(B)=1, and all elements associated with B got updated value. In new P we can say that A|B = A ∩ B or A|B = A. But all those are not clearly stated in his definition (in his following explanation he said the sample space becomes B rather than Ω, which is even more misleading because Ω doesn't need to change). Is my understanding correct? Thanks for any help. A following question can be found in here: Fallacy on using interpretation instead of definition in computing conditional probability? (using multiplication law circularly?) (also I think its best not to define conditional probability this way. This should be a result instead of a definition.)","['statistics', 'probability', 'definition']"

In order to keep the same power to each polynomial, I fixed some variables. $$\sum_{n=2}^{+\infty} n(n-1) x a_n (x-1)^{n-2} \implies t:=n-2 \implies \sum_{t=0}^{+\infty} (t+2)(t+1) x a_{t+2} (x-1)^{t} \implies \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} (n+2)(n+1) x a_{n+2} (x-1)^{n}  $$ $$\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} 3a_n (x-1)^n \quad \text{no transformation needed}$$ Then I wrote the addenda again: $$\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} (n+2)(n+1) x a_{n+2} (x-1)^{n} - \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} 3a_n (x-1)^n = 0$$ Now I checked the bounds of sums, in order to have them common for each sum, and

2410971,How should we think about the sections of a sheaf on a scheme as functions?,"I have to admit it is a little embarrassing that I have come this far learning about schemes without feeling like I am really comfortable with this. Suppose $(X, \mathcal{O}_{X})$ is a scheme. In fact, for the purposes of this question it probably suffices to just consider an affine scheme. What I am really wanting to know is, how should we $\textit{really}$ think about the sections of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$? Or perhaps an equivalent question: How are the different formalisms equivalent? To elaborate, consider the treatment in Eisenbud & Harris. There, they treat the ""functions"" on an affine scheme $\text{spec}A$ as being elements $f \in A$ whose action on a point $p \in \text{spec} A$ (corresponding to prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subseteq A$) is something like
$$   f: p \mapsto A / \mathfrak{p} \longrightarrow \kappa(p),  $$
with $\kappa(p)$ being the residue field at $p$. So in this sense, the sections can be thought of as functions mapping points into a different field at every point. Hartshorne begins simply by stating that the sections over $U$ are functions 
$$
s: U \longrightarrow \bigsqcup_{p \in U} A_{\mathfrak{p}}
$$
which satisy certain localness properties. This formalism of Hartshorne seems very analogous to the construction of the sheaf associated to a presheaf. Indeed that construction does exactly the same thing: You consider maps from the open sets into the disjoint union of stalks and impose certain localness conditions. So is the sheaf that Harthshorne defines for affine schemes somehow the sheafification on something much more simple? So how exactly are all these ideas tied together? I feel like something is not really clicking. When we talk about a section of $\mathcal{O}_{X}(U)$, what is this object $\textit{really}$? As a function, what does it do? How does the collection of these functions give rise to the sections of bundles of germs as in Harthsorne?

My first attempt was to restrict $A$ to arbitrary finite subspaces $H\subset E$, but then in general $A|_H\notin\mathcal L(H)$, that is, $H$ is not necessarily invariant under the action of $A$. At most I can assume that $A|_H\in\mathcal L(H,A(H))$, but then I cant use the same strategy that used before for the case of $E$ being finite-dimensional, what used the eigenvalues of $A$. Some help will be appreciated, thank you. I had an idea (I dont know if it would work): if I prove that $e^{t(\lambda-A)}\to \infty$ seems then easy to show that $e^{-t(\lambda-A)}\to 0$.","['linear-algebra', 'analysis']"
2411237,Show $(\ln(x))^a<\sqrt x$ for any $a>1$,"How do I show that for any $a>1$ there is a $C>0$ so that for any $x>C$ the inequation below is true:
$$ (\ln(x))^a<\sqrt x$$
I know that for a certain $a>1$ I can use the function:
  $$ f(x)=(\ln(x))^a-\sqrt x$$
And now to show that this function is monotonic (increasing) for a certain $M>0$. For a small $a$ I managed to show that, but for larger ones it becomes a hard work. Moreover, I thought about showing that a limit of $$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac {(\ln(x))^a}{\sqrt x}=0$$ 
which is known and then use the $\varepsilon$ definition of limit to show the inequation, but I don't know how to prove the limit above for any $a>0$ without using l'Hôpital a few times.","['inequality', 'limits']"
2411246,Problem with two loaded die and the probability to get a sum greater than 10 knowing the outcome of one die,"I face the following problem but disagree with the solution that has been provided to me: You throw two times a loaded die such that $P(1)=P(3)=P(4)=P(5)=1/8$ and >$P(2)=P(6)=1/4$. One of the dice gave 6 (but we don't know which one). What is the probability that the sum that you obtain is strictly greater than 10? The solution that I received is the following: The results can be written as $(6, x)$ and $(x, 6)$, where $x$ must be equal to 5 or 6. So $P(> 10) = 2×(1/8+1/4)−1/4 = 1/2$. But I am skeptical about this answer, as the ""method"" does not work if we try to compute the complement $P(=10$ or lower than $10)$, as the result would give a probability greater than 1... I however cannot figure out where the problem comes from!",['probability']
2411251,Difficult ring-theory problem,"Let $(R,+,\cdot)$ be a ring with at least 2 elements. If we know that $R$ is not a field and $x^2=x$ for any $x \in R$, where $x$ is not invertible, prove that: a) $a+x$ is not invertible, $\forall a,x\in R$, where $a$ is invertible and $x$ is not invertible, $x \neq0$ b)$x^2=x, \forall x\in R$ My solution, which is not correct: a) Let $U(R)$ be the group of invertible elements from $R$. Obviously, if $a \in R$ is invertible, then $a^{-1}$ is invertible, too. Also,
 for any $t \in U(R)$ and for any $s \in R-U(R)$, we have that $t \cdot s \in R-U(R)$. $(1)$ We suppose $a+x \in U(R)$. $a+x=a \cdot(1+a^{-1}x)$ Hence $1+a^{-1}x \in U(R)$, which means that $a^{-1}x \in U(R)$, contradiction with $(1)$. So our supposition is false. It follows that $a+x \in R-U(R)$. (This is wrong, take $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ for instance) b) Let $y \in R-U(R), y\neq0$. From a), we have that $1+y$ is not invertible. Then $(1+y)^2=1+y\Leftrightarrow 2y=0$. Let $a$ be an invertible element. $(a+y)^2=a+y$ $ \Rightarrow a^2+ay+ya+y^2=a+y$ $ \Rightarrow a^2+ay+ya+=a$ I thought that $R$ should be commutative, hence $ay+ya=ya+ya=2ya=2y\cdot a=0\cdot a=0$ . So, $a^2=a$, and thus we obtain that $a=1$ is the only invertible element. Knowing that $x^2=x, \forall x \in R-U(R)$ and that $1^2=1$, we obtained that $x^2=x, \forall x \in R$","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory']"
2411277,Fallacy on using interpretation instead of definition in computing conditional probability? (using multiplication law circularly?),"This is a following question after Is the definition of conditional probability misleading . After defining the conditional probability this way, Rice immediately introduced the multiplication law: But isn't this law totally circular (if we don't prove extra things)? If we want to know P(A ∩ B) using this law, we must know P(A | B), but P(A | B) can only be computed using P(A ∩ B) if we follow the definition instead of interpretation. Here is an example Rice uses that could illustrate my point: The method he compute P(A|B) is: ""if a red ball has been removed on the first trial, there are two red balls and one blue ball left. Therefore, P(R2 | R1) = 2/3."" But he is using the interpretation of conditional probability instead of the actual definition. I see nowhere in the definition that says you could compute P(A | B) by assuming B is true while all other background information stay the same. Now here is a subtle thing, in almost all his elementary examples, the P is actually unique. So following the axioms you get the same P. In this example, adding ""R1 is true"" into the background information, you could derive an unique P that happens to be equal to the P(..|B) using the definition of conditional probability. But in general in order to let this to happen, you must prove that the two P are the same (one by incorporating B is true into background knowledge and one by using the definition of conditional probability). Is my thinking in here correct? If so, how to state the interpretation clearly and how to prove this interpretation using the definition of conditional probability?","['statistics', 'probability', 'definition']"

2411302,Finding a $\text C^\infty$ function which is zero just on a given closed set [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Every closed subset $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is the zero point set of a smooth function (1 answer) Closed 6 years ago . If $\text E$ is an arbitrary closed set in $\mathbf R^n$, show that there is an $\text f\in \text C^\infty(\mathbf R^n)$ such that $\text f(x)=0~$for every $x \in \text E$ and $\text f(x)>0$ for every other $x\in \mathbf R^n$. My approach is as follows : Since $\text E$ is given to be closed hence $\text E^c=\text V$ will be an open set in $\mathbf R^n$ and hence $\text V$ can be written as countable union of open sets $\{\text V_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ and hence one can have a partition of unity $\{\psi_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}\subset \text C^\infty (\text V)$ such that $\text {supp}(\psi_i)\subset \text V_i$. Then if i take $f=\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} \psi_i$ then my this $\text f$ is in $\text C^\infty (\text V)$ and $f(x)>0$ in $\text E^c$ and $f(x)=0$ in $\text E$. Now i am just left with to show that $f\in \text C^\infty (\mathbf R^n)$ or how can i generalize my $f$ to get the desired result. Any type of help will be appreciated.
