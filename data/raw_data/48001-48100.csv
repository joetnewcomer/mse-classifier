484162,Limits and continuity and MVT,"Okay, so in class today we went over proving continuity by the formal definition of limits, that is $$\forall \epsilon \gt 0, \exists \delta \gt 0 \mid \lvert x-a \rvert \lt \delta \implies \lvert f(x)-f(a)\rvert\lt\epsilon$$ So, that's all fine. But my professor gave an example where $f(x)=\ln(x)$ and he tried to show continuity at $x=2$. Now, he proved it using the MVT: $$\lvert\ln(x)-\ln(2)\rvert = \lvert f'(c) \left(x-2\right)\rvert$$ Am I crazy to think this cannot be used? For the MVT, you are assuming continuity, but we are trying to prove continuity! Also, if MVT cannot be used, can someone show how to prove this?","['continuity', 'limits']"
484172,Calculating number of edges from a degree sequence,"Problem: Suppose a graph $G$ has degree sequence $25, 18, 18, 5, 2, 2$. How many edges are there in $G$? I am assuming since the definition of degrees of a vertex that each one of the 6 vertex's (since there are $6$ nums in the degree sequence) has $n$ edges(paths) ($n$ being one of the six numbers in the degree sequence). So would the total number of edges in this case be $25+18+18+5+2+2$? I don't think this graph exists as a simple graph, but would have to be drawn with the three vertices having degrees of $18$, $18$, and $25$ have loops or multiple edges between them. Do those count in the total number of edges?","['graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

484303,Fact about measurable functions defined on $\sigma$-finite measure spaces.,"$\bf{\text{Background:}}$ Let $(\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, and $X$ be a Banach space. A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is simple if it assumes only finitely many values.  That is, there exists subsets $E_{1}, ... , E_{n}$ of $\Omega$ and scalars $x_{1}, ... , x_{n}\in X$ such that $f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\chi_{E_{i}}x_{i}$. If the sets $E_{i}$ can be chosen from $\Sigma$, then $f$ is $\mu$-measurable simple. A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is measurable if it is the limit of a sequence of $\mu$-measurable simple functions (almost everywhere). $\bf{\text{Problem Statement:}}$ A function $f:\Omega\to X$ is measurable $\Leftrightarrow$ $\chi_{E}f$ is measurable for all $E\in \Sigma$ such that $\mu(E) < \infty$. $\bf{\text{Partial Solution:}}$ The $(\Rightarrow)$ direction is easy.  Write $f = \lim_{n\to\infty}f_{n}$ for $\mu$-measurable simple $f_{n}$.  Then $\chi_{E}f_{n}$ is $\mu$-measurable simple and converges $\chi_{E}f$ almost everywhere. The $(\Leftarrow)$ direction is giving me problems.  I thought at first to let (as in the definition of $\sigma$-finite) $(E_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $\Sigma$ such that $\mu(E_{n}) < \infty$ and $\Omega = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty}E_{n}$, and defining 
$F_{n} = \cup_{j=1}^{n}E_{j}$.  Then for each $n\geq 1$, take a sequence $(g^{n}_{m})_{m=1}^{\infty}$ of $\mu$-measurable simple functions which converges to $\chi_{F_{n}}f$, by assumption.  I thought I might be able to show that $g_{n}^{n}\to f$ almost everywhere, but I couldn't figure out the trick.  My idea is below. I claim that $\{\lambda\in \Omega : g^{n}_{n}(\lambda)\not\to f(\lambda)\}\subset\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\{\lambda\in\Omega : g^{n}_{m}(\lambda)\not\to \chi_{F_{n}}(\lambda)f(\lambda)\}$, the latter set being $\mu$-measure $0$.

484334,Are there two conventional definitions of “holomorphic”?,"In Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis , second edition, on page 213, two definitions are stated.  One of them says the derivative of $f$ at $z_0$ is $$f'(z_0)=\lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0}.\tag 1$$ The other says $f$ is holomorphic in an open set if $f'(z_0)$ exists at every value of $z_0$ in that set. By that definition, holomorphic doesn't just mean differentiable; it means differentiable at every point in some open set. He never defines “holomorphic at” a point, but only “holomorphic in” an open set. Before opening the book this afternoon, just remembering from years ago, I thought what it said was $f$ is differentiable at $z_0$ if $(1)$ holds; and $f$ is holomorphic at $z_0$ if the derivative exists at every point in some open neighborhood of $z_0$ . By that definition $f(z)=|z|^2$ would be differentiable at $0$ but not holomorphic at $0$ . Thus differentiability at an isolated point would be weaker than holomorphy at that point. QUESTION: Do both conventions exist? I take “ $f$ is analytic at $z_0$ ” to mean $f$ has a convergent power series expansion at $z_0$ , which actually converges to the right thing, the value of $f$ , in the interior of its circle of convergence. Differentiability at every point in some open neighborhood of $z_0$ is enough to prove analyticity, but differentiability at $z_0$ is not. By one of the conventions above, one can say a function holomorphic at a point is analytic at that point; by the other one cannot.","['convention', 'terminology', 'complex-analysis']"
484350,How to compute Bochner laplacian $\Delta=\nabla^*\nabla=\sum \nabla_{e_i}$?,"I'm struggling with proving that Bochner laplacian can be described by the following formula similar to the standard laplacian formula from calculus: $$\Delta = \sum_i \nabla_i^2,$$ where $\nabla_i = \nabla_{e_i}$ for some local orthonormal basis $e_i$ and $\nabla$ is a connection satisfying any reasonable conditions (Levi-Civita on $TM$, the induced connections on $\Omega^k(M)$). We live on a compact $C^\infty$ Riemannian manifold without boundary and the laplace operator is defined as $\nabla^*\nabla$, where $\nabla$ is viewed as a map $\Gamma(E)\to \Gamma(T^*M \otimes E)$ between spaces with scalar product and thus the adjoint operator $\nabla^*\!\!:\Gamma(T^*M \otimes E) \to \Gamma(E)$ is well defined*.

Here is a (slightly paraphrased) excerpt: Definition 3.1. The small inductive dimension of $X$ is denoted $\ind(X),$ and is defined as follows: We say that $\ind(X)=-1$ iff $X=\emptyset$ . $\ind(X)\le n$ if for every point $x\in X$ and for every open set $U$ such that $x\in U,$ there exists an open $V$ with $x\in V$ such that $\overline V\subseteq U$ and $\ind(\partial V)\le n-1$ (where $\partial V$ is the boundary of $V$ ). $\ind(X)=n$ if $\ind(X)\le n$ but $\ind(X)\not\leq n-1$ . $\ind(X)=\infty$ if for every $n,$ $\ind(X)\not\leq n$ . Remark 3.2. An equivalent condition to condition 2 is: The space $X$ has a basis $\mathcal B$ such that for every $U\in\mathcal B$ we have $\ind(\partial U)\le n-1$ . Now, it is easy to see that condition 2 implies this alternate condition, but it seems to me that, unless we know that the space $X$ is regular-- i.e. , unless we know that for every point $x\in X$ and every open $U$ with $x\in U$ , there is some open $V$ such that $x\in V$ and $\overline V\subseteq U$ --we can't conclude that the alternate condition implies condition 2.

   ($\Rightarrow$)
       Assume that $f$ is one to one and $A$ is a nonempty set. Let set $C=$range $f$. Since f is one to one then every $b\in C$ there is a unique element call it $a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$. Now we define a function $g$ where $g:B\rightarrow A$ as such: Since $C\subseteq B$ it follows that $|C|\leq |B|$. Then for each $a\in A$ we let $a=g(b)$ for some $b\in C$. Thus $g(b)=g(f(a))=a=1_A$. Since $C\subseteq B$ any element(s) call it $k$ where $k\in B$\ $C$  we can assign any $a_0\in A$ such that $g(k)=a_0$ since $k$ is not mapped by $f$. ($\Leftarrow$)
   Assume there exists a function $g:B\rightarrow A$ such that $g \circ f=i_a$ Let $a_1,a_2 \in A$ such that $a_1\neq a_2$ Then it follows that $g(f(a_1))=a_1$ and $g(f(a_2))=a_2$ Thus $g(f(a_1))\neq g(f(a_2))$ Thus $g \circ f$ is one to one. Let $x_1,x_2\in A$. Then it follow that $g(f(x_1))=g(f(x_2)) \implies$ that $x_1=x_2$ by definition of one to one. Thus it follow that $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ Hence f is one to one.

Then there exists a basis so that the matrix generated by $T$ under that basis is upper triangular. The proof is by induction on $k$. But how to generate such a basis. The first step is that because $v$ is a complex vector space, so there exists a non-zero vector $v$ such that $Tv=\lambda v$ for some $\lambda \in \Bbb F$. So, take $e_1=v$ because then $T(e_1)=\lambda e_1$. So, in the first column of the matrix the rows 2 to n will be zero.

484715,Criteria for an Immersion into Projective Space,"I am doing Exercise II.7.7c in Hartshorne (not homework). In this problem, he asks to show that the linear system of conics in $\mathbb{P}^2$ passing through a fixed point $P$ gives an immersion of $\mathbb{P}^2-P$ into $\mathbb{P}^4$ (over $k$ algebraically closed). Considering the point $P=(1:0:0)$, this linear system has a basis ${y^2,z^2,xy,xz,yz}$ and these generate $O(2)$ except at the point $P$. Thus, they define a map $\phi:\mathbb{P}^2-P\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^4$. What I am wondering is how to show that this map is an immersion in the sense of Hartshorne (factors into an open embedding followed by a closed embedding). In particular, I am wondering if some modified version of Hartshorne Proposition 7.3 can be used. This proposition says that if $X$ is projective variety over $k$ algebraically closed, then giving a closed immersion into projective space is the same as giving global sections of an invertible sheaf such that the space they span separates points and tangent vectors. It seems to me that separating points and tangent vectors still makes sense in this context, despite the fact that  $\mathbb{P}^2-P$ is not projective. If the sections defining $\phi$ span a subspace of global sections of $O(2)_{|\mathbb{P}^2-P}$ which separates points and tangent vectors, can I then conclude that $\phi$ is an immersion in the sense above?

484752,Concentrated schemes are closed under finite gluings,"Let $X$ be a scheme. Assume that $X = \cup_i X_i$ is finite open covering, such that the $X_i$ as well as their intersections $X_i \cap X_j$ are concentrated, i.e. quasi-compact and quasi-separated (see Daniel Murfet's notes on concentrated schemes as well as EGA IV.1). Does it follow that $X$ is concentrated? I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question. Clearly $X$ is quasi-compact, as a finite union of quasi-compact subspaces. In order to show that $X$ is quasi-separated, it suffices to show that for open affines $U \subseteq X_i$ and $V \subseteq X_j$ their intersection $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact. Well this is clear for $i=j$ since $X_i$ is quasi-separated. But what happens for $i \neq j$? Somehow we have to use that $X_i \cap X_j$ is quasi-compact. Here is a more abstract idea: We have to show that $\Delta : X \to X \times X$ is a quasi-compact morphism. This can be checked locally on the base, hence it suffices to prove that the morphisms $X_i \cap X_j \to X_i \times X_j$ are quasi-compact. Well, $X_i \cap X_j$ is quasi-compact, hence by (EGA IV, 1.1.2 (v)) it would suffice that $X_i \times X_j$ is separated. But we don't assume that the $X_i$ are separated, they are just quasi-separated. Note that actually EGA IV.1.2.7.c proves the claim, but I don't understand the proof. Here is my translation: ""We know that in order to prove that $\Delta : X \to X \times X$ is quasi-compact, it suffices to prove that the inverse images $X_i \cap X_j$ of the $X_i \times X_j$ are quasi-compact (1.1.1)"". Here, (1.1.1) is just the definition of a quasi-compact morphisms, after which it is remarked that it suffices to prove this with respect to an affine(!) open covering. But here, we just have an open covering consisting of quasi-compact schemes. This seems to be a gap? Or does the following statement hold (which we could then apply to $\Delta$)? If $f : X \to Y$ is a morphism and $Y$ is covered by quasi-compact open subsets $Y_i$ such that each $f^{-1}(Y_i)$ is quasi-compact, then $f$ is quasi-compact. I doubt that this is true without any assumption on $Y$. Edit. Sorry I think now I can answer my question. The treatment of quasi-compact morphisms is better in EGA I (1970), §6. Specifically, in order to show that $X_i \cap X_j \to X_i \times X_j$ is quasi-compact, it suffices that $X_i \cap X_j$ is quasi-compact and $X_i \times X_j$ is quasi -separated by Prop. 6.1.5. (v), and we have both. Note that EGA VI.1.2.7 is reproduced as EGA I.6.1.12, but still the end just refers to the definition of quasi-compact morphisms, which doesn't seem to suffice? So what about a more direct proof, showing directly that (with the notation above) $U \cap V$ is quasi-compact? One can spell out the proof above as follows (still quite tricky): $X_i \cap X_j \to (X_i \cap X_j) \times (X_i \times X_j)$ is a base change of the diagonal of $X_i \times X_j$, which is quasi-compact, hence it is also quasi-compact. Since $U \cap V$ is the preimage of the quasi-compact open subscheme $(X_i \cap X_j) \times (U \times V)$, it is quasi-compact. (Usually I delete a question when I solve it quickly before an answer arrives, but this time I won't because it has already some upvotes and therefore seems to be interesting for others, too. Besides, I would like to know if you also agree that the EGA proof has a gap.)","['general-topology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes']"

Can I tell if there is a 'thing'(simple connected closed surface) on space which each of its vertex is $270^\circ$(summing up the angle near it), then that 'thing' has 6 faces? Here I tell you why I think about this silly question. Everyone should know that sum of exterior angle of polygon is $360^\circ$. Of course I know the proof, but I try to think it in a different way: Every point have $360^\circ$ 'to be occupied' and every two line can span a space which included angle $<180^\circ$. When you draw a from a point, you actually 'occupied some angle'. Every time you bent your line, you span another direction( here the bending $<180^\circ$). Once the line reaches the original point, all $360^\circ$ are 'occupied'. Then If I tell you this 'thing'(simple closed curve) consist of $n$ angles which EACH of it is $108^\circ$, then you can immediately tell me $n=5$. I generalize it into 3D spaces. If there is a point in space and you span some surface from it, actually you occupied some 'space angle' of the point. Here I do not know how to define the sharpness of a vertex and my thought is just adding the angle of faces around that point just like '$270^\circ$' in a vertex of a cube. The smaller the 'space angle'(my definition) is, the sharper it is. Just like drawing polygon, planes can be spaned from a vertex which 'space angle'$<360^\circ$. Every time the plane reach a vertex, it occupied some 'space angle'. May be when the plane reach the original vertex, all 'space angle' are occupied and the drawing is completed. In this case, can I tell about the amount of faces I draw? The whole idea is just like Gauss-Bonnet Thm. For a simpe connected closed orientable regular surface, $$\oint_SKdA=2\pi\chi(S)$$ where K is the Gaussian curvature and $\chi(S)$ is the Euler chracteristic of S. If $S$ is homeomorphic to a sphere(in this case a polyhedron), Then $\oint_SKdA=4\pi$. Just like in a 2D plane, the simple closed plane curve have the property $\oint_C\kappa ds=2\pi$ where $\kappa$ is the curvature of the curve $C$.Is it useful to answer my question? Maybe in polygon, the most angle you can 'occupied'$=\oint_C\kappa ds=2\pi$ and in polyhedron, maybe the 'space angle' you can occupied are related to Gauss Bonnet Thm.","['general-topology', 'geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'solid-geometry']"

The proof is rather simple (in hindsight). My particular scenario is a simpler version, where $a_j=a_{-j}\in\mathbb R$, which gives an even stronger result: $a(z) = b(z)b(1/z)$ for all complex $z$. But I'm not managing to use this constructively - I'm not sure in general there is a constructive approach, because we can't explicitly reduce all polynomials. In any case, my particular case is, $$a(z) = (4-128\theta) + (112\theta-1)(z+z^{-1}) + 64\theta(z^2+z^{-2}) + 16\theta(z^3+z^{-3})$$ I'm simply not managing to find $\{b_j\}$.

The third intersection point of the line and the cubic gives the new rational point). My question is about the mysterious $-432$. Why is it true that if the original rational solution $(x, y)$ has $xy\neq 0$ and if
  $c\neq 1, -432$, then repeating this process leads to infinitely many
  distinct solutions? Edit. Later in the book (page 24), there is a explicit calculation that puts the cubic $u^3+v^3=\alpha$ into Weierstrass Normal Form. The resulting equation is $y^2=x^3-432\alpha^2$. So in particular, $y^2=x^3-432$ is Weierstrass Normal Form of $x^3+y^3=1$.

Additional information to the problem: Observe that equation $4i + 5j = 40$ has as integer solutions: $(i,j) \in \{ (0,8), (5,4), (10,0) \}$ Steps: We know that: $$ (s+t)^n = \sum\limits_{r=0}^n {{n}\choose{r}} s^rt^{n-r}$$ For $s = x^5$ and $t = 1+x^4$: $$(1 + x^4 + x^5)^{100} = \sum\limits_{r=0}^{100} {{100}\choose{r}} x^{5r} (1+x^4)^{100-r} \implies \bigstar $$ This is supposed to be an intermediate step that uses again the first rule for analyzing $(1+x^4)^{100-r}$: 
  $$(1+x^4)^{100-j} = \sum\limits_{\textbf{k=0}}^{\textbf{100-r}} {{100-r}\choose{k}} x^{4k}$$
  I think there is a typo in the presentation and the correct one is:
  $$(1+x^4)^{100-r} = \sum\limits_{\textbf{k=0}}^{\textbf{100-r}} {{100-r}\choose{k}} x^{4k}$$ Using the above we get to:

485320,Prove that the tent map has exactly nine 6-cycles.,Prove that the tent map $$T(x)= \begin{cases}2x& \text{if} &0 \le x \le 1/2\\2-2x& \text{if}&1/2<x \leq 1\end{cases}$$ has exactly nine 6-cycles. This is my first proofs class and we have yet to prove anything in class. My professor gave us this problem to do by Monday and I honestly have no idea of where to start or what to do.,"['dynamical-systems', 'discrete-mathematics', 'chaos-theory']"
485336,Is there a compact set which is not Jordan measurable?,"Is there a compact set which is not Jordan measurable? Intuitively, the answer seems like there is no such set but I could not find a proof anywhere. Does anyone know of a proof or a counter example?","['general-topology', 'measure-theory', 'compactness']"
485340,Period of the function $\sin (8\pi \{x\})$,"My question is to to find the period of 
$$\sin(8\pi\{x\}),$$ 
where $\{\cdot\}$-is the fractional part of function. I know that the period of $\{\cdot\}$ is 1 and the period of $\sin(8\pi x)$ is $1/4$. But how to find the overall period of the given function?","['algebra-precalculus', 'periodic-functions']"
