What I have tried so far as following. I am using induction on $r$ (not fixing the ring). The base case is for $r=1$ which I did assuming the minimal degree of $g$ for which $fg=0$ holds. So my induction assumption is for $r \geq 2$ whenever $f$ is in $A[x_1,x_2,\ldots x_r]$, $n<r$ is a zero divisor there is $a$ in $A-\{0\}$ such that $af=0$.

948043,Conformal cobblestones,"Open-ended question: It strikes me that the cobblestone pattern known as Bogen, which can be seen in many European cities, is a fairly accurate representation of the conformal mapping defined by the complex function $f(z) = \ln(z)$: Conformal mappings make a good basis for such patterns because of their angle-preserving property, which means that a square grid is mapped onto a curvilinear orthogonal grid which can be easily constructed from an arrangement of square cobblestones (setts). The curves in the Bogen pattern are catenaries of equal strength . They are described by $\xi = c - \ln{\cos{\eta}}$ and $\xi = c - \ln{\sin{\eta}}$, where $f(z) = \xi + i\eta$ and $c$ is a real constant. Other conformal mapping functions commonly seen in cobblestones are $f(z) = z$ (rectilinear) and $f(z) = e^z$ (circular).

My concern is, even if $f$ and $g$ are non-zero at the same time for all $z\in D$, what happens if we permit $f(z_1)=0$ and $f(z_1)\neq 0$ for some $z_1\in D$, or vice-versa.

948149,Differentiability and continuity of a trig function,"Here's a problem I'm having a lot of trouble with: We have the following function: $f(t) = t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t})$ for $t \neq 0, f(t) = 0$ for $t = 0$. Show $f$ is continuous everywhere, use the squeeze theorem for $t=0.$ Show $f$ is differentiable in $ t\neq 0$, and find the derivative $f'(t)$. Show (using the definition of differentiability: $f'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0}\dfrac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h}$) that $f$ is differentiable in $t=0$ and find the derivative $f'(0)$. Show that the derivative $f'$ is not continuous in $0$. Look at $f$ on the domain $[0, \infty]$. Show that $f$ has no local maximum or minimum in the boundary point $0$. You can do this by showing that for every number $a>0$ there are values with $0<t<a$ for which $f(t) >0$ and also values $t$ with $0<t<a$ for which $f(t) < 0$. Here's my attempt (and my difficulties) at these: I don't exactly know how to show that a function is continuous everywhere, but from what I looked up online this is what I tried: $t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t})$ has a domain $\mathbb{R}$, except at $t=0$, where it is undefined. However, we have $f(0) = 0$, so to show $f(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$ we have to show that $\lim_{t \to 0} f(t) = f(0) = 0$. We can do this by the squeeze theorem: On the interval $[-1,1]$ we have $$-1 \leq \cos(\dfrac{1}{t}) \leq 1$$   $$-t^2 \leq t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t}) \leq t^2$$ We know that $\lim_{t \to 0} -t^2 = 0$, and  $\lim_{t \to 0} t^2 = 0$, so  $\lim_{t \to 0} t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t}) = 0$, by the squeeze theorem. Here my biggest confusion lies in the fact that you have to ""show"" that $f$ is differentiable for $t \neq 0$, before actually differentiating it. This implies that the two are not equal to each other, which I didn't expect. My logic tells me that if you're able to find a function's derivative, you've shown that it exists. But I think what they want here is for you to find the derivative using the following method: At $ t \neq 0$, we have $f(t) = t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t})$. This function is differentiable if the following limit exists: $$\lim_{h \to 0}\dfrac{(t+h)^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t+h}) - t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t})}{h}$$ Sadly, I don't know how to evaluate this limit, and you're not allowed to use L'Hospital because we haven't had that in class yet. Would anyone know how to do this using more ""elementary"" methods (meaning mostly algebraic stuff)? Of course, I can find the derivative using traditional means, it is $2t\cos(\dfrac{1}{t}) + \sin(\dfrac{1}{t})$, but I don't know if that's sufficient because of the way the question is phrased. The first part of this question is a mystery to me, here's what I tried: Use the definition of differentiability, and fill in $t=0$ in the equation. We get $$ f'(0) = \lim_{h \to 0}\dfrac{h^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{h}) }{h}$$ Of course this makes no sense, because we're dividing by zero and stuff, and even if we remove that term as I did above, the limit still doesn't exist. So I have no clue how to tackle this problem otherwise. As for the continuity of $f'$ in 0: $ \lim_{t \to 0} 2t \cos(\dfrac{1}{t}) + \sin(\dfrac{1}{t})$ doesn't exist, hence it is not continuous at $0$. I understand this conceptually, but I have no idea how to tackle it. I understand that as $t$ goes to $0$, that the amplitude of $t^2\cos(\dfrac{1}{t})$ goes to $0$ because $t^2$ goes to $0$ and I understand that the period will also go to $0$ because $\dfrac{1}{t}$ goes to infinity. But I don't know how to prove that there will always exist a number arbitrarily close to $t=0$ for which $f(t)>0$ or $f(t)<0$.","['calculus', 'algebra-precalculus', 'limits']"

948171,Why are real numbers useful?,"A question (by a fellow CS student taking a first course in calculus, presumably after the lecture in which continuity was introduced: was as follows. In the real, physical world, we deal with numbers that are sort of “finite” or “discrete” by their nature; there's no such thing as a perfect circle in the physical world. In CS, we model computers with discrete mathematics and it’s enough. So why real analysis? Why concepts like continuity and “completeness” of real numbers are useful? Why do we need them? I found Math.se has lots of questions for similar “concrete” justifications for complex numbers and great answers for them, but I didn’t really manage to find similar for this. The question Are all numbers real numbers? is related, but I’m not sure it’s exactly what I’m looking for. My attempt at an answer was along the line: Are we content with the length of the side of a square that has area of 2 units remaining a undefined number, even if we never manage find such a square? and Calculus and real analysis provide results that are useful even if in numerical calculations we use finite approximations. To really understand what's going on, we want it to be rigorous. but I’m not sure if I was persuasive enough.

948226,"If $f$ is equal to an affine function up to $1$-th order at $a$, then $f$ is differentiable at $a$, proof more subtle then it appears?","I came across the following exercise: Two functions $f, g : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ are equal up to $n$th order at $a$ if $$ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - g(a + h)}{h^n} = 0.
$$ Show that $f$ is differentiable at $a$ if and only if there is a function $g$ of the form $g(x) = a_0 + a_1(x - a)$ such that $f$ and $g$ are equal up to first order at $a$. For the proof, if $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $a_0 := f(a)$ and $a_1 = f'(a)$ fulfill the requirements, this is the easy direction. For the other direction, suppose there exists such an $g(x) = a_0 + a_1(x-a)$, then I found [precisely I found it here , it is Problem 2-9] the following solution, on
$$
 \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - (a_0 + a_1h)}{h}
$$
add $\lim a_1 = a_1$ to get
$$
 \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - a_0}{h} = a_1.
$$
For $a_0 \ne f(a)$, the limit diverges, so we must have $a_0 = f(a)$, then we get the limit for the derivative, and so $a_1 = f'(a)$. $\square$ But I doubt that
$$
 \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - a_0}{h} < \infty \qquad (*)
$$
implies $a_0 = f(a)$ (if nothing is assumed about $f : \mathbb R\to \mathbb R$). I think everything that follows is that: 1) $\lim_{h\to 0} f(a+h) = a_0$ 2) $f(a) \to a_0$ faster then any linear term (otherwise the $h$ in the denominator would not be ""compensated"" and it still diverges) And so $a_0 = f(a)$ just follows for continuous $f$, where we have $\lim_{h\to 0} f(a+h) = f(a)$?

948239,Basis-free and noncommutative versions of the two-polynomials-over-ring problem (McCoy theorem etc.),"There is a rather canonical bunch of exercises in commutative algebra which tend to come up time and again on math.stackexchange: recently in #948010 and #83121 , formerly in #227787 and #413788 , and in many other places, such as Messing/Reiner arXiv:1209.6307v2 . Probably its most well-known appearance is as Exercise 2 in Chapter 1 of Atiyah/Macdonald's ""Introduction to Commutative Algebra"". Let me rephrase that exercise: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, and let $A\left[x\right]$ be the ring of polynomials in one variable $x$ over $A$ . Let $f \in A\left[x\right]$ . (a) Show that $f$ is a unit in the ring $A\left[x\right]$ if and only if the constant coefficient of $f$ is a unit and all other coefficients are nilpotent. (b) Show that $f$ is nilpotent if and only if all coefficients of $f$ are nilpotent. (c) Show that $f$ is a non-zero-divisor in $A\left[x\right]$ if and only if every $a \in A$ satisfying $af = 0$ satisfies $a = 0$ . (We say that an element $u$ of a commutative ring $B$ is a non-zero-divisor if and only if every $v \in B$ satisfying $uv = 0$ satisfies $v = 0$ .) (d) We say that a polynomial in $A\left[x\right]$ is primitive if and only if $1$ is an $A$ -linear combination of its coefficients. Show that for any two polynomials $f$ and $g$ in $A\left[x\right]$ , the product $fg$ is primitive if and only if $f$ and $g$ are primitive. Notice that what I call (c) is the contrapositive of Atiyah/Macdonald's Exercise 2 (c) , as the notion of a non-zero-divisor is the correct constructive way to formalize statements about zero-divisors. The exercise is followed by an Exercise 3 which asks for generalizations of all of these results to multivariate polynomial rings $A\left[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right]$ ; I believe these can be done by induction over $n$ (though I have not really checked). Solutions of the problem given in literature are usually not constructive per se, but can often be rewritten in constructive terms. $\newcommand\Sym{\operatorname{Sym}}$ A question I have posed to myself long ago, but never had the time to seriously think about, is the following: A polynomial ring is a particular case of a symmetric algebra. What happens if we blindly generalize the exercise to symmetric algebras in general? Let $A$ be a commutative ring, and let $V$ be an $A$ -module. Let $\Sym V$ denote the symmetric algebra of $V$ over $A$ . Let $f \in \Sym V$ . (Sa) Prove or disprove that $f$ is a unit in the ring $\Sym V$ if and only if the $0$ -th homogeneous component of $f$ is a unit and all other homogeneous components are nilpotent. (Sb) Prove that $f$ is nilpotent if and only if all homogeneous components of $f$ are nilpotent.

Another direction to generalize things in is that of noncommutative polynomials. There is no difference between commutative polynomial rings $A\left[x\right]$ and noncommutative polynomial rings $A\left<x\right>$ in one variable, so let us state the question in multiple variables: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, and let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ . Let $A\left<x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right>$ be the ring of noncommutative polynomials in the variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ over $A$ .

(Na) Prove or disprove that $f$ is a unit in the ring $A\left<x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right>$ if and only if the constant coefficient of $f$ is a unit in $A$ and all other coefficients are nilpotent. (Nb) Prove or disprove that $f$ is nilpotent if and only if all coefficients of $f$ are nilpotent. (Nc) Prove or disprove that $f$ is a left non-zero-divisor in $A\left<x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right>$ if and only if every $a \in A$ satisfying $af = 0$ satisfies $a = 0$ . (We say that an element $u$ of a ring $B$ is a left non-zero-divisor if and only if every $v \in B$ satisfying $uv = 0$ satisfies $v = 0$ .) (Nd) We say that a noncommutative polynomial in $A\left<x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right>$ is primitive if and only if $1$ is an $A$ -linear combination of its coefficients. Prove or disprove that for any two noncommutative polynomials $f$ and $g$ in $A\left<x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\right>$ , the product $fg$ is primitive if and only if $f$ and $g$ are primitive. Finally, the two generalizations can be combined into one that concerns the tensor algebra. (This is not to say that it will entail the symmetric-algebra version as a corollary.)

When $d + 1$ is squarefree, many prime multiples of $d + 1$ are valid values for $n$.  But if $d + 1$ is not squarefree, no multiples of it (except possibly itself) are feasible values for $n$.  In either case, valid $n$ values which are not multiples of $d + 1$ are much less abundant.

948652,Alternative introduction to tensor products of vector spaces,"One of the main obstacles in understanding the tensor product is that, unlike many other algebraic structures, you cannot really get hold of its element structure. This confuses many beginners. The universal property tells us that this doesn't really matter and it helps us to construct linear maps on the tensor product, but it takes a while to appreciate this level of abstraction. So what about constructing the tensor product in a different way? Here is a suggestion. I would like to hear what you think about it. Let $V,W$ be vector spaces over a field $K$. Let us assume that $V$ is finite-dimensional. Define the tensor product $V \otimes W := \hom(V^*,W)$. This is a vector space by construction. Its elements are just linear maps $V^* \to W$. If $v \in V$, $w \in W$, we define the pure tensor $v \otimes w \in V \otimes W$ by $(v \otimes w)(\omega)=\omega(v) \cdot w$. Observe that $(v+v') \otimes w=v \otimes w + v' \otimes w$ and $(\lambda v) \otimes w = \lambda(v \otimes w)$, likewise for the other variable, i.e. $V \times W \to V \otimes W$ is a bilinear map. Any element $\alpha \in V^* \otimes W$ is a sum of pure tensors: If $e_1,\dotsc,e_n$ is a basis of $V$, then $\alpha = \sum_i e_i \otimes \alpha(e_i^*)$. (Because the right hand side maps $e_i^*$ to $\alpha(e_i^*)$.) Universal property: If $b : V \times W \to U$ is a bilinear map, there is a unique linear map $f : V \otimes W \to U$ such that $f(v \otimes w)=b(v,w)$ for all $(v,w) \in V \times W$. Proof. Uniqueness follows since every element is a sum of pure tensors. For existence, we just let $f(\alpha)=\sum_i b(e_i,\alpha(e_i))$. Then one easily checks $f(e_j \otimes w)=b(e_j,w)$ and therefore $f(v \otimes w)=b(v,w)$. $\checkmark$ The universal property shows in particular that the tensor product of finite-dimensional vector spaces is symmetric: There is a unique isomorphism $V \otimes W \cong W \otimes V$ mapping $v \otimes w \mapsto w \otimes v$. [Of course, lots of other nice properties of the tensor product also follow from the universal property.] If $V$ is not assumed to be finite-dimensional, we define $V \otimes W$ as the subspace of $\hom(V^*,W)$ which is generated by the pure tensors $v \otimes w$ as defined above. (Thus, if $V$ is finite-dimensional, there will be no difference.) The universal property follows immediately.","['tensor-products', 'linear-algebra', 'education']"

That means that for all $m$, $$\left\lvert \frac{g_m(x)-g_m(y)}{x-y} \right\rvert\leq M $$ as $x\rightarrow y$.

948722,"$p$ prime, Group of order $p^n$ is cyclic iff it is an abelian group having a unique subgroup of order $p$","I've just read from An introduction to the theory of groups from Rotman's the following theorem: Theorem 2.19. Let $p$ be a prime. A group $G$ of order $p^n$ is cyclic
  if and only if it is an abelian group having a unique subgroup of order $p$. Proof Necessity follows at once from Lemma 2.15. For the converse, let 
  $a \in G$ have largest order, say $p^k$ (it follows that $g^{p^k} = 1$ for
  all $g \in G$). Of course, the unique subgroup $H$ of order $p$ is a subgroup
  of $\langle a\rangle$. If $\langle a\rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $G$,
  then there is $x \in G$ with $x \not \in \langle a\rangle$ but with
  $x^p \in \langle a\rangle$; let $x^p = a^l$. If $k = 1$, then $x^p = 1$ and
  $x \in H \subset \langle a\rangle$, a contradiction; we may, therefore,
  assume that $k>1$. Now $$1 = x^{p^k}=(x^p)^{p^{k-1}}=a^{lp^{k-1}},$$
  so that $l = pm$ for some integer $m$, by Exercise 2.13. Hence,
  $x^p = a^{mp}$, and so $1 = x^{-p}a^{mp}$. Since $G$ is abelian,
  $x^{-p}a^{mp} = (x^{-1}a^m)^p$, and so
  $x^{-1}a^m \in H \subset \langle a\rangle$.
  This gives $x \in \langle a\rangle$, a contradiction. Therefore,
  $G = \langle a\rangle$ and hence is cyclic. As usual, there is some trivial part of the proof which I don't understand:
I don't see why ""If $\langle a\rangle$ is a proper subgroup of $G$,
then there is $x \in G$ with $x \not \in \langle a\rangle$ but with
$x^p \in \langle a\rangle$"", I understand the rest of the proof.

948758,"The ""Largeness"" of Subsets of the Natural Numbers","Recently, I was thinking about the Erdős conjecture on arithmetic progressions , which says that, if, for a set $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ , the sum $\sum_{a\in A}\frac{1}a$ diverges (i.e. ""A is large""), then $A$ has arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. My thoughts on this were that the condition of the sum of reciprocals diverges seems unnatural, so I wanted to study the condition of largeness further. After a bit of work off of an order arising from a certain category, I came up with a conclusion that we can compare the largeness of sets as follows, for subsets $A$ and $B$ of $\mathbb{N}$ : Let $f_A$ and $f_B:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that $f_A(n)$ and $f_B(n)$ are the $n^{th}$ element of $A$ and $B$ respectively. $A$ is larger than $B$ if the following set is small (i.e. sum of reciprocals converge) for some $k>0$ : $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_A(n)}{f_B(n)}>k \right\}$$ Intuitively, this says that $f_A$ and $f_B$ should be within a constant multiple of each other almost all the time, and if $f_A$ is consistently less than $f_B$ , then $A$ must be larger than $B$ (i.e. it has more elements and so $f_A$ grows less quickly). This clearly forms a partial order; there are pathological examples which are incomparable, so it is not a total order - for instance: $$A=\mathbb{N}\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}[(2i)!-(2i-1)!,2(2i)!)$$ $$B=\mathbb{N}\cap\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}[(2i+1)!-(2i)!,2(2i+1)!)$$ where both, containing infinitely many intervals $[x,2x)$ , each having reciprocals sum to about $\log(2)$ are large; however, the ratio of $f_A$ to $f_B$ grows ever further away from $1$ , so neither is larger than the other under my definition. But those are awful functions; primarily, the issue is that $A$ is larger than the set of every other element of $A$ and similarly for $B$ - this contradicts intuition about sets. So, I want to consider only the sets for which $A$ and ""every other element of $A$ "" are equally large and whether my order is a total order in that case. Thus, my question: Suppose $f_A$ and $f_B$ are increasing functions $\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that, for some constant $k$ the two sets: $$\left\{f_A(n):\frac{f_A(2n)}{f_A(n)}>k\right\}$$ $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_B(2n)}{f_B(n)}>k\right\}$$ are small. Is it necessarily true that some $k_2$ can be chosen such that at least one of $$\left\{f_B(n):\frac{f_A(n)}{f_B(n)}>k_2 \right\}$$ $$\left\{f_A(n):\frac{f_B(n)}{f_A(n)}>k_2 \right\}$$ is small?","['order-theory', 'sequences-and-series', 'number-theory']"

In terms that these students are familiar with, since they haven't been exposed to linear algebra yet, my thought was to say that the equation for a line, $y = mx+b$, is ""linear"" in $x$ (ignoring the technicality that it's actually an affine equation, not a linear one), because it's in the form ""coefficient times $x$"", and then we allow another term which is just a lonely coefficient. And then we extend this notion to saying that the above differential equation is ""linear"" in $y$ and $y'$, but this time the coefficients are allowed to be functions of $x$. That's probably a good enough hand-wavy explanation to help students remember the definition, at the very least. I couldn't really think of a good reason why it ""should"", a priori, be kosher to allow coefficients to be functions of $x$ here. At that point it seems to me like you just have to get into the linear algebraic definition of linearity, which, being completely foreign to the students... it just seems to be a bit too deep of a rabbit hole for this purpose. So my question is: does anyone have a better way of approaching this?

The following is a basic theorem in measurable functions. Any non-negative measurable function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a pointwise limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of simple functions. Many standard books (Stein-Shakarchi/ Royden) gave proof without any geometric motivation or explanation. Further, following Stein-Shakarchi (p.31), the construction is done in three stages, with a sequence of functions in each stage. I failed to understand this constructive proof, by asking myself 'why to consider this' at many stages. 
The proof is almost like an algebraic manipulation. I know that Lebesgue's idea is to partition the range of $f$ rather than domain, while studying its integration. So, in the proof of theorem I am talking about, it is the range of $f$ which is partitioned. But, I couldn't get why it is done in this way.

The converse is true, a well known property of homeomorphisms. I know the result is true for $n = 1$. In that case, it's not very hard to see, that $f$ maps open intervals to open intervals: Image is going to be interval, and if it had a boundary point, some $x$ in the open interval would have to map to the boundary point. But now images of $(x, \infty)$ and $(-\infty, x) $ couldn't both be connected. Also, pre-image of open interval is also open: If $x < y$ are pre-images of endpoints of the interval, the original interval is subset of image of $[x,y]$, but then clearly image of $(x,y)$ is the open interval. Those two observations prove that $f$ is homeomorphism when $n = 1$.

Show that: $$ P_j(x,v,\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{iux}}{2\pi} \hat{P_j}(u,v,\tau)du\\ = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\pi}\int_0^\infty Re\left[\frac{\exp[C_j(u,\tau)\bar{v}+D_j(u,\tau)v+iux]}{iu} \right]du $$ This result comes up in a text I am reading on stochastic volatility models, it is stated but not proven, the math involved is probably way above my level, but it would be great to see the steps involved in proving this. I guess it just amounts to showing the imaginary part of this integral is equal to half. I don't mean for the question to be lazy, I have worked through all other parts of this relatively long proof, this technique seems to be used a lot in stochastic volatility/liquidity models which I am interested in studying further, and that's the reason I posted.","['stochastic-calculus', 'finance', 'complex-analysis']"
949608,divisibility of number of solutions of $x_1+\cdots+x_k=n$,"I observed that the number of solutions in positive integers $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ of $$x_1+\cdots+x_k=n$$ for fixed $k$ and $n$ is always a multiple of $k$ as long as $\gcd(k,n)=1$. For example, $$6=2+1+1+1+1,$$
$$6=1+2+1+1+1,$$
$$6=1+1+2+1+1,$$
$$6=1+1+1+2+1,$$
$$6=1+1+1+1+2,$$ i.e. there are $5$ solutions. Is there any combinatorial rationale behind this? (i.e. combinatorial argument, e.g., via bars and stars?)","['discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

949708,Understanding and interpreting graph spectra,"I'm not a mathematician, but a geographer trying to get a grasp on some network analysis I'm experimenting with. I have a few questions related to spectral graph theory that a mathematician could help me with: I'm generating random graphs of 50 nodes and density 0.17 that have particular average path length, modularity, etc. Each of these graphs produce spectra (distribution of eigenvalue) resembling this: From a novice point of view, I am tempted to tell that a semi-circle shape, if weak, is forming between eigenvalues 0.6 and 1.55. What would that mean? Is this related to the typical semi-circle seen in random graphs? What about the peak at eigenvalue 0.4? Could it be the second
eigenvalue, which is often related to algebraic connectivity? Are the values close to zero typical of anything? To broaden the question, how much can one conclude, in terms of graph structure, from looking at the spectrum of a graph (laplacian or otherwise)? This may seem naive, but can one ever use a graph spectra (perhaps averaged over many graphs) as a structural signature?","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'graph-laplacian', 'matrices', 'graph-theory', 'spectral-graph-theory']"

Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 9 years ago . Improve this question I'm asking for big picture in geometry here. I've studied the first three chapters of John Lee's smooth manifolds but still I cannot see the path ahead. My questions are mainly about classification of the subjects of geometry, I like to know beforehand where everything is.I don't need the definitions I just need to see how these fields are connected together and classified . So I list my questions here instead of posting them separately because I think they are related or at least I believe some can make them related: There are some additional structures on manifolds like Riemannian, Symplectic, complex and so on. How are they classified? Is it correct to say differential geometry is the study of either Riemannian or Symplectic structures or there are finitely other structures? And there are other kinds of structures like complex , quaternionic structures? And where should one place contact geometry, conformal , Möbius geometries? Where is metric geometry in this picture and what are CAT(k) spaces? What is the difference between geometric topology and differential topology? Are G-structures the improved and modernized version of Erlangen program?
