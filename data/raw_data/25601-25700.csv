232408,Dini's Theorem. Uniform convergence and Bolzano Weierstrass.,"In Spivak's chapter on uniform convergence he asks to prove the following THEOREM Let $\{f_n\}$ be  sequence of continuous functions that converge pointwise to $0$ over $[a,b]$ . If $0\leq f_{n+1}\leq f_n$ for each $x$ and $n$ , then convergence is actually uniform over $[a,b]$ . Now, he asks, as he did in other occasions, to argue by contradiction and use Bolzano Weierstrass to find an ""appropriate sequence $\{x_n\}$ "". I'm guessing he wants me to find a sequence that goes to $0$ but $f_n(x_n)\not \to 0$ . I honestly didn't look at that option, but I wrote the following direct proof : PROOF (This was awfully wrong) I also don't see why it is essential that the $f_n$ are continuous. Could you provide a proof using Bolzano Weierstrass? With this, it seems one can prove Dini's theorem, which seems an immediate result: THEOREM Let $f_n\to f$ pointwise and monotonically over $[a,b]$ , with each $f_n$ continuous, and $f$ continuous. Then $f_n\to f$ uniformly. PROOF Assume $\{f_n\}$ increasing, and set $g_n=f-f_n$ . Then the $g_n$ are continuous, $g_n\to 0$ pointwise and $$0\leq g_{n+1}\leq g_n$$ By the above, $g_n\to 0$ uniformly over $[a,b]$ , that is, $f_n\to f $ uniformly over $[a,b]$ . If $\{f_n\}$ is decreasing, consider $\{-f_n\}$ . Then Spivak asks $(1)$ What if $f$ is not continuous? $(2)$ What if we replace $[a,b]$ with $(a,b)$ ?","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'continuity', 'uniform-convergence']"

Assuming I'm correctly understanding the definitions of the direct image functor and of morphisms of ringed spaces, a morphism from a ringed space $(X, O_X)$ to a ringed space $(Y, O_Y)$ is a continuous map $f\colon X\to Y$ along with a natural transformation $\varphi$ from $O_Y$ to $f_*O_X$.

It is possible to multiply integers very fast if they are represented via the Chinese Remainder Theorem—though perhaps still not in linear time. Alas while addition and multiplication are fast in this representation, it seems to make it harder to compare two numbers. Thus a natural question is: Does there exist a representation of integers so that addition, multiplication, and comparison are all doable in linear time?

232692,Characterizing all entire functions that map the unit circle to itself.,"Actually, I'm solving the following problem.
there are some steps I can't understand. Can you guys help me to understand? The problem is:
Find all entire functions that map the unit circle to itself.
(problem from Rudin's real & complex analysis chapter 12 ex.4) excluding the constant function, I first showed that $f$ should have zero inside unit disk
and $f$ should map open unit disk into itself by using maximum modulus theorem. Lots of proof I found then say that its zero should locate at only origin.
That's the first part that I cannot understand. and then they consider $ g(z) = [\bar f(\frac{1}{\bar z})]^{-1} $ 
and showed that $g(z) = f(z)$ on unit circle. which has a limit point in $C - \{0\}$.
so by identity theorem, (that's the second part; I'm not sure $g(z)$ is even analytic except some singular point, since it involves conjugation.)
$f(z) = g(z)$ on $C-\{0\}$.
Then by considering the order of pole at $0$, we can conclude that. To study further, I tried to find lots of materials and above discussion may due to 
identity theorem for meromorphic functions, analytic continuation, etc. But we never learned this. I think there may be an easier way by just using elementary properties of analytic function or schwarz lemma. Can you help me please?",['complex-analysis']

Proof: Let $X$ be a connected subset of $R$, and let $Z$ be the closure of $X$. Suppose (to get a contradiction) that $Z$ is disconnected. That means there are two nonempty open subsets of $R$ covering $Z$, call them $U$ and $V$, such that $U\cap Z$ and $V\cap Z$ are nonempty while $U\cap V\cap Z$ is empty. Then $U$ and $V$ cover $X$ also. And since $U\cap V\cap X \subseteq U\cap V\cap Z$, then $U\cap V\cap X$ is empty. Pick points $u\in U\cap Z$ and $v\in V\cap Z$ (which exist since those sets are nonempty). That means $u$ is in the closure of $X$ and $U$ is an open neighborhood of $u$, so $U\cap X$ is nonempty. Similarly, $V\cap X$ is nonempty.

The second one, $\{(f,g)|f(x)-g(x)=1,\text{for all } x \in Z\}$ I can see how this isn't reflexive, because $f(x)-f(x)= 0$ is always true for any function. I can also see how it isn't symmetric, because although $f(x)-g(x)=1$ could be true, it's counter-part, $g(x)-f(x)=-1$, won't be true. Despite me being able to see those facts, I can not see how it isn't transitive. How would I show that? The third one, $\{(f,g)|\text{for some }C~\in Z,\text{for all } x\in Z, f(x)-g(x)=C\}$ I had the idea that it wasn't an equivalence relation based on the fact that if we let $f(x)= x$, and $g(x) = x -1$, and say $x=1$, then $f(1)-g(1)=C \rightarrow C=1$, but $g(1)-f(1)=C \rightarrow C=-1$. The C values aren't the same, implying the relation wouldn't be symmetric, right? Also, I am not sure how to prove or disprove that the relation is transitive. The last one is similar to the first one: $\{(f,g)|f(0)=g(1)\wedge f(1)=g(0)\}$; and like the first one, I am not sure where to begin. Sorry that this post is rather long. But thank you for reading! and I hope that you can help me.","['relations', 'equivalence-relations', 'discrete-mathematics']"

I am trying to show that if there are $\geq p+1$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, then the union of all these subgroups has order $\geq p^{n+1}$. In the case where there are exactly $p+1$ Sylow $p$-subgroups, we can find a homomorphism $G \rightarrow S_{p+1}$, which has kernel $K$ of size $p^{n-1}$ since $(p+1)!$ is divisible by $p$ but not by $p^2$. Then if $P$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup, the subgroup $PK$ has order power of $p$, hence $|PK| \leq p^n$ and by the order formula for $PK$ we find that $|P \cap K| \geq p^{n-1}$. Therefore $K \leq P$. Since $K$ is contained in every Sylow $p$-subgroup, the intersection of all Sylow $p$-subgroups has order $p^{n-1}$.

For any closed, connected  $A, B \subset X$ with $X = A \cup B$, the intersection $A \cap B$ is connected.
For example, any closed interval on the real line is unicoherent, but a circle is not."" Thus it is known that the spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the usual (euclidean) topology are unicoherent, and proofs can be found in various topology texts. I am interested in knowing whether anyone has any knowledge of methods that might be used to prove that $\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-euclidean topologies are unicoherent (or not). My particular interest is the the classical fine topology from potential theory (the coarsest topology which makes all the subharmonic functions continuous), since if I knew that $\mathbb{R}^n$ were unicoherent, I could possibly make some progress with some work I did some years ago (and conversely, if I knew that it were not unicoherent, then I would at least know that I would be wasting my efforts trying to do so!). My background is in analysis, and my knowledge of algebraic topology is limited to little more than the contents of any book entitled something like ""A first Course in Algebraic Topology"", but if anyone could point me in the direction of any results concerning unicoherence in non-euclidean topologies, or any methods that might be appropriate for tackling such questions, I would be grateful.","['general-topology', 'algebraic-topology']"

233269,Odd and even numbers in Pascal's triangle-Sierpinski's triangle,"Moderator Note: At the time that this question was posted, it was from an ongoing contest. The relevant deadline has now passed. I recently learned that when the Pascal's triangle is reduced to parity(ie even terms are represented as 0, odd terms are represented by 1), the result is  a figure resembling Sierpinski's triangle in pattern. This I found to be a very fascinating result. Then I began to notice some sequences, such as particular sequences of zeroes and ones appearing in various rows. An observation I made is that as Pascal's triangle is symmetric by way of $\binom{n}{m}= \binom{n}{n-m}$, the reverse of any sequence of 0s and 1s that appears in this version of Pascal's triangle will also appear. Looking at various sequences, the shortest sequences to not seem to appear were $1101$ and its reverse, $1011$. I attempted to then prove two things. First, I wanted to prove that these sequences would never appear in the 'parity Pascal triangle'. I can see intuitively why they would never appear- if we divide the Sierpinski triangle into stages of itself, we see that the $101$ sequence only appears in the middle row of the second stage of the fractal, and as the $nth$ stage of the fractal only appears as part of the $n+1$th stage of the fractal, this sequence will always be followed by the center of $0$s of another stage of the fractal. Similarly, any sequence $100...11$ can appear, but $1011,100011, 1000000011$, and so on with the number of 0s being of form $2^n-1$ cannot appear. As I said, intuitively this is because $2^n-1$ 0s bookended by two 1s appears at places where either one of the two 1s is on the edge of the fractal and the other at the edge of the central triangle of 0s in some stage of the fractal. For examples of this happening, see the bottom row of the diagram, the third row of the diagram, the fifth row of the diagram, the ninth row of the diagram. Can anyone formalize this argument into a full, general proof of my statement? Similarly, for any size of sequence, how can we more explicitly describe all sequences that appear in this 'Parity Pascal' triangle or, more easily, that don't appear in it? And how for any size of sequence, how can we enumerate appearing sequences? If anyone could give further direct/explicit proof and explanation for the modulo 2 relations Micah mentions(whether or not you do this through making it explicit in terms of Lucas' theorem is not a matter) and why the rules can determine whether a string is in Pascal's mod 2 triangle the way they do, that would be fantastic!

So far we've been unable to get the signs to come out right, terms that should cancel aren't, and terms that should combine don't. We're hoping another set of eyeballs will find the sign error. Or perhaps the formula itself is wrong, or one of our assumptions is wrong? Instead of posting the general proof, which is very lengthy and nearly illegible, I thought I would post instead a computation of a special case in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Let $f(x)g(y,z)\,dy\in\Lambda^1\mathbb{R}^3\cong \Lambda^0\mathbb{R}\otimes\Lambda^1\mathbb{R}^2.$ $\Delta(fg\,dy)=(*d*d)(fg\,dy) + (d*d*)(fg\,dy)=(*d*)(g\partial_xf\,dx\wedge dy +f\partial_zg\,dz\wedge dy) + (d*d)(fg\,dz\wedge dx)
=(*d)(g\partial_xf\,dz-f\partial_zg\,dx) + (d*)(f\partial_yg\,dy\wedge dz\wedge dx)=*(g\partial^2_xf\,dx\wedge dz + \partial_xf \partial_yg\,dy\wedge dz-f\partial_y\partial_zg\,dy\wedge dx-f\partial^2_zg\,dz\wedge dx) + d(f\partial_yg)=-g\partial^2_xf\,dy + \partial_xf \partial_yg\,dx+f\partial_y\partial_zg\,dz-f\partial^2_zg\,dy+\partial_xf\partial_yg\,dx+f\partial^2_yg\,dy+f\partial_z\partial_yg\,dz$ Now the Laplacian of a 1-form on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is given by $\Delta(g\,dy)=(\partial^2_y+\partial^2_z)g\,dy$ and the Laplacian on 0-forms on $\mathbb{R}$ is just $\Delta(f)=\partial^2_xf$. So the result I'm expecting is $\Delta(fg\,dy)=(\Delta f)g\,dy+f(\Delta g\,dy)=g\partial^2_xf\,dy+f(\partial^2_y+\partial^2_z)g\,dy.$ If I could flip the sign of the first and fourth terms in 1, and also flip either the second or fifth so they cancel, and also flip either the third or seventh so they cancel, then the result would be proved. However we can find no sign error which would justify doing so. What we have instead is $\Delta(fg\,dy)=-(\partial^2_xf)g+f(\partial^2_y-\partial^2_z)g\,dy+(\partial_xf\partial_yg\,dx+\partial_xf\partial_yg\,dx)+(f\partial_y\partial_zg\,dz+f\partial_z\partial_yg\,dz)$ How can I make this calculation work out? Maybe some of my Hodge stars are incorrect? I'm putting $*(dx)=dy\wedge dz,*(dy)=dz\wedge dx,*(dz)=dx\wedge dy,*(dx\wedge dy)=dz,*(dy\wedge dz)=dx,*(dz\wedge dx)=dy,*(dx\wedge dy\wedge dz)=1.$ Those formulas are standard on $\mathbb{R}^3$. But could they somehow be different because I'm decomposing $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a product $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^2$, and each product factor has its own orientation? And though I haven't posted it here due to length, we've also worked out the derivation for arbitrary an $k$-form $\omega\wedge\eta$ on $M\times N$, and I have similar problems there; terms that should combine don't, terms that should cancel don't.

  and let $H$ be its mean curvature.  If $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$
  denotes the $L^2$ inner product, then the Willmore energy can be
  expressed as $$W = \langle H, H \rangle.$$ Equivalently, since mean
  curvature can be expressed as $H = \nabla \cdot N$ where $N$ is the
  unit normal field, we have $$W = \langle \nabla \cdot N, H \rangle.$$
  But by Stokes' theorem $$\langle \nabla \cdot N, H \rangle = -\langle N, \nabla H \rangle.$$ And since $\nabla H$ is always tangent to $M$,
  this inner product vanishes, i.e., the Willmore energy is always zero! Where did I go wrong?

Granted that what I stated is correct, why would my book say that the $\ker(T)=\{a_0: a_0 \; \text{is real}\}$? Yes, $a_0$ can be any real number, but what must $a_1$ or $a_2$ equal?
