36095,"$\lim\int_{E_i}f = \int_{E}f$ when $\lim d(E_i , E) = 0$","Another question in my studies (of Lebesgue integration): I'm given a continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, a nonempty compact set $E\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, and a sequence of nonempty compact sets $E_i$ such that $$\lim d(E_i , E) = 0$$where this $d$ is Hausdorff distance . I am asked to prove that $$\lim \int_{E_i} f=\int_E f$$ Visually, this seems pretty straightforward, the $E_i$ are being forced to look more and more like $E$, and the continuity of $f$ ensures that the farther along the $E_i$ we pick, $f$ has to vary less and less where $E_i$ and $E$ don't coincide. I've been at this for a while and seem to be stuck.  For a while though I hadn't noticed the compactness assumed of $E$ and the $E_i$.  Putting the continuity and convergence in Hausdorff distance together, I see that for any $x\in E$, $\varepsilon>0$, and $\delta > 0$, there is eventually some $E_i$ for which I can find a $y\in E_i$ within $\delta$ of $x$ and with $|f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon$.  I guess using compactness, I can make this uniform over all $x\in E$ (so that my picture described above is actually as nicely behaved as I was probably picturing it to begin with). At this point though I'm not sure how to proceed.  Should I try to bound the integral over the symmetric difference of $E_i$ and $E$ or something like that?  I'm not sure how I would control it, despite knowing it would be constrained somehow by ""nearby"" values of $f$.  Should I cut up $E$ somehow, or select some dense subset of $E$ to use representative values of $f$ on?  Is there some subtlety my visual intuition is overlooking? Added It seems like there is a counterexample to this theorem as stated: Let $E=[0,1]$ and let $E_i = \{ k 2^{-i} : k=0,1,\dots,2^i \}$ so that
$$\array{
E_1 & = & \{0,\frac{1}{2}, 1\} \\
E_2 & = & \{0,\frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, 1\} \\
& \vdots
}$$ Then, for example, with $f$ taken to be the constant $1$ function on $[0,1]$, we have $\int_{E_i} f = 0$ for all $i$, yet $\int_{E} f = 1$.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'real-analysis']"
36098,"Functions, graphs, and adjacency matrices","One naively thinks of (continuous) functions as of graphs 1 (lines drawn in a 2-dimensional coordinate space). One often thinks of (countable) graphs 2 (vertices connected by edges) as represented by adjacency matrices. That's what I learned from early on, but only recently I recognized that the ""drawn"" graphs 1 are nothing but generalized - continuous - adjacency matrices, and thus graphs 1 are more or less the same as graphs 2 . I'm quite sure that this is common (maybe implicit) knowledge among working mathematicians, but I wonder why I didn't learn this explicitly in any textbook on set or graph theory I've read.

36210,Is the limit of power of a stochastic matrix still a stochastic matrix?,"Suppose $A$ is a right stochastic matrix, which is defined as a square matrix each of whose rows consists of nonnegative real numbers, with each row summing to 1. If $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} A^n$

36234,Simplifying an expression involving $x^x$,"Is it possible to simplify the following function:
$$p(n, k) = \sum_{\substack{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = n \\\ x_i \in \mathbb{N}}} x_1^{x_1} x_2^{x_2} \cdots x_k^{x_k},$$ or, at least, find a good (easy to compute) approximation of $\log{(p(n, k))}$? Here is my motivation.
Consider a probabilistic node $A$ with $k$ output arrows $a_1, \cdots, a_k$, and let us assume that the probability of passing the $k$-th arrow is $p_k$. Then the probability of consecutively moving through arrows $x = \langle a_{i_1}, \cdots, a_{i_n} \rangle$ is 
$$
p^A(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^n p_{k_i} = \prod_{i = 1}^k p_i^{s_i},
$$
where $s_i$ is the number of occurences of $a_i$ in $x$. So given a sample $x$ and a probabilistic node $A$ the optimal length of a code describing $x$ is about $\log(\frac{1}{p^A(x)})$, and the shortest code is achieved for $A$ having probabilities $p_1 = \frac{s_1}{n}, \cdots, p_k = \frac{s_k}{n}$. Now, let us assume that we do not know probabilities at $A$. Then any code describing $x$ via $A$ has to contain some information about these probabilities. A ``uniform approach'' would look like follows: for a given sample $x$ chose the optimal probability node $A_x$, then $u(x) = p^{A_x}(x)$ is not a probability on $k^n$ as it does not sum up to $1$ (it does not contain information about choosing appropriate $A_x$); however $p(x)$ is, where
$$
p(x) = \frac{u(x)}{\sum_{y \in k^n} u(y)} = \frac{\prod_{i = 1}^k s_i^{s_i}}{\sum_{t_1 + \cdots + t_k = n} \prod_{i = 1}^k t_i^{t_i}}.
$$ One may take another approach based on Bayesian interpretation. Let us fix a meta-distribution $q$ on all probabilistic nodes $A$ having the same output arrows. This distribution chooses probabilities $p_1, \cdots, p_k$, that is --- non-negative real numbers such that $p_1 + \cdots + p_k = 1$ --- then for a given sample $x$ chose a node $A_{p_1, \cdots, p_k}$ with probability $q(A_{p_1, \cdots, p_k})$ and describe $x$ according to that node: 
$$
b(x) = \int_{p_1 + \cdots + p_n = 1, p_i \geq 0} p^{A_{p_1, \cdots, p_k}}(x) q(A_{p_1, \cdots, p_k}).
$$
If $q$ is a uniform distribution (and I have not made any mistake during calculations), then 
$$
b(x) = \frac{\int_{p_1 + \cdots + p_k = 1, p_i \geq 0} \prod_{i = 1}^k p_i^{s_i}}{\mathit{Vol}(\Delta_k)} = \frac{\Gamma(k) \prod_{i = 1}^k\Gamma(s_i + 1)}{\Gamma(\sum_{i = 1}^k (s_i + 1))}.
$$
So $$p(x) = p \prod_{i = 1}^k s_i^{s_i}$$ is proportional to the probability corresponding to the Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ seen from the perspective of a ""stateless"" random source, and $$q(x) = q \prod_{i = 1}^k s_i^{\underline{s_i}}$$ is inversly proportional to the number of sequences containing exactly $s_i$ of $a_i$ (if there are a lot of such sequences, then from the perspective of a ""stateless"" random source they are ""more"" random, so less interesting). Here $p, q$ are some constants. In fact, these distributions are really close --- by using Striling's formula $n^{\underline{n}} \approx \sqrt{2\pi n}(\frac{n}{e})^n$ we have
$$q(x) \approx q' \prod_{i=1}^k s_i^{s_i+\frac{1}{2}}$$ where $q' = q\;e^{-n} (2\pi)^{k/2}$ is just another constant. I would like to compare $p(x)$ with $b(x)$.","['probability', 'combinatorics']"

36253,Perfect closure is perfect,"I've been self-studying inseparable extensions and there's something that seems obvious to everybody but not to me. Let's clear out some definitions that are not so universal: Let $K$ be a field and $f\in K[X]$ a polynomial. We say it is separable if all its roots are distinct over its splitting field. We say it is purely inseparable if it has only one root over its splitting field, and this root is multiple. A field extension $F\subset K$ is purely inseparable (resp. separable ) if every element of $K$ is the root of a purely inseparable (resp. *separable) polynomial in $F[X]$. A field K is perfect if every irreducible polynomial over K is separable. Let $F\subset K$ be a field extension of characteristic $p$. The perfect closure , or purely inseparable closure of $F$ in $K$ is the greatest intermediate field that is purely inseparable over $F$. We will denote it by $K^p_F$ We can prove that $K^p_F$ consists of all the elements $\alpha\in K$ such that there is $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\alpha^{p^n}\in F$. Another property that may be useful is that an irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic $p$ splits on its splitting field like this: $$f(X)= a_0(X-a_1)^{p^n} \dots (X-a_r)^{p^n}$$ where the $a_1,\dots,a_r$ are pairwise distinct. Now, why is it true that $K^p_F$ is a perfect field? Please try to prove it only using these definitions and properties.

This seems naively like a ""good"" topology to use for $X$.  However, one quickly learns that this is not so; that the product topology is the natural one. The box topology has many strange properties that make it a good source for counterexamples, but I am not aware of it having any other applications.  So I would like to know: Are there examples of using the box topology to prove interesting ""positive"" statements?

$$\nabla^2 \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{| \det g |}} \partial_a \left( \sqrt{| \det g |} g^{ab} \partial_b \phi \right)$$

$$\nabla_{a} \left( g^{ab} \nabla_b \phi \right) = \partial_a \left( g^{ab} \partial_b \phi \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{| \det g |}} \partial_a \left( \sqrt{| \det g |} g^{ab} \partial_b \phi \right)$$

The usual modern presentation method of Definition- Theorem - Proof often starts with the discovery method of Object - Property - Pattern, just finding and naming things is the first step. In another thread, I came across the concept of 'holomorphic'. An answer to How to express in closed form? led to my asking the question Complex conjugate of z without knowing z=x+iy . I had never heard the term 'holomorphic' before, but wikipedia helped. Looking at complex analysis texts online, I couldn't find anything in their indexes. Lots of papers use it, and there are lots of questions here on math.SE, so it must be part of everyday (higher) math. The definition includes 'analytic' which (I think ) means you can take an infinite sequence of derivatives (which means you can create a Taylor series for it)). But then I don't see what's special about that (I'm sure that's obvious but I just don't know; so you can compute values quickly?) and that means something even -more- for complex functions. So the question here is...why is 'holomorphic' such a big deal? And is it in fact? If a complex function is holomorphic you can do ..what  with it? if it is not holomorphic, is there anything else you can do with it?

36614,How to construct a simple complex torus of dimension $\geq 2$?,"This is an exercise in the first chapter of ""Complex Abelian Varieties"" by Christina Birkenhake and Herbert Lange. As the title suggests it asks for an example of a complex torus of dimension $\geq 2$ not admitting any nontrivial complex subtorus. The following is what I have tried for dimension 2.  By a change of coordinate over $\mathbb{R}$, we can assume that the lattice is $\mathbb{Z}^4$. The question is equivalent to constructing a $4\times 4$ real matrix $J$ such that $J^2=-\mathrm{Id}$ and $J$ has no nontrivial invariant subspaces that are spanned by vectors with rational coefficients.  Let $J$ be such a matrix, then for any nonzero $v_1 \in \mathbb{Q}^4$, we must have $Jv_1 \neq xv_1+yv_2$ for any $v_2\in \mathbb{Q}^4$ and $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.    To achieve this, we note that the field generated by the coordinates of $xv_1+yv_2$ has at most transcendental degree 2 over $\mathbb{Q}$, so if we can choose $J$ with many independent transcental entries such that $Jv$ have high transcendental degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ for all  $v\in \mathbb{Q}$, then the problem is solved.  But it is at this place I got stuck.  Intuitively, I feel this is doable. But I am having trouble to write down such a matrix. Of course, there are probably other approaches to the problem (the Jacobian of a curve in general position of genus $n\geq 2$, for example). Thank you. Edit: I should also assumed that $\det(J)=1$ so it preserves orientation.  I think the solution probably look like this: we consider the space of all complex structures on $\mathbb{R}^4$. Each $2$ dimesnional subspace of $\mathbb{Q}^4$ defines a ""subvariety"" on this space, namely all $J$'s that preserve this subspace. These gives us countably many such ""subvarieties"".

36707,The Wronskian of holomorphic differentials as a q-differential,"I just went through a proof of the counting of Weierstrass points on a Riemann surface (References: Reyssat, Quelques aspects des surfaces de Riemann and Farkas & Kra, Riemann Surfaces ) that says that the total number of Weierstrass points on  Riemann surface, taking into account their ""weight"" is $(g-1)g(g+1)$, where $g$ is the genus. A key point of this proof is the introduction of the Wronskian of a basis of the space $\Omega^1(X) = H^0(X,\Omega^1_X)$ of holomorphic differentials. More precisely: if your base is $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_g$ and that in the coordinate $z$ they are written $\omega_j = f_j dz$, you consider the Wronskian
$$ W_z = \begin{vmatrix} f_1 & f_2 & \ldots & f_g \\ f'_1 & f'_2 & \ldots & f'_g \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ f_1^{(g-1)} & f_2^{(g-1)} & \ldots & f_g^{(g-1)} & \end{vmatrix}$$ Then, a simple but unenlightening computation proves that, through a change of coordinates $z \mapsto w$, the Wronskian is transformed by multiplication by $\left(\frac{dz}{dw}\right)^q$ where $q=\frac{g(g+1)}2$. So that means that the Wronskian of differential forms exists as a q-differential (and moreover, because I considered a basis of $\Omega^1(X)$, the Wronskian is canonically defined, up to a constant, which is very important for the said proof but, I think, irrelevant for my question). After these quite indigestible prolegomena, here is my question: Is there a ""higher-level"" way of seeing that the Wronskian of a bunch of forms exists as a $q$-differential, without doing any explicit boring computation on the expressions in charts? Of course, every enlightening comment on all this stuff will be greatly appreciated.","['riemann-surfaces', 'algebraic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

The shorter the distance between any two points, the easier it is for information and objects to travel between different places.    While it may be obvious that a spherical world is better than a flat world, it's far from obvious that a spherical world is optimal in this regard, which brings me to the question: what should the book have been titled?  More precisely: Question: Define a world to be a 2-manifold with some fixed surface area S and a metric d that calculates distance on the surface of the manifold. What shaped world minimizes average distance between any two randomly selected points in the world? Does the answer depend on whether the world can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$?

Interestingly, its value is near 2 (that is, far from its asymptotic value) for many useful values of x: for example, $1.8<G(x)<2.1$ for $14<x<10^{77}.$ It seems that $G$ has a maximum near 3637.133905003816072848664328 of 2.01119450670696919822787997170113557148977275... and to decrease very slowly thereafter.

I've been reading through Zorich's ""Analysis I"" book recently, and I came across this nice little exercise. Let $f: [0,1]\to \mathbb R$ be a continuous function such that $f(0)=f(1)$. Show that for any $n\in \mathbb N$ there exists a horizontal closed interval of length $\frac 1n$ with endpoints on the graph of this function; if the number $\ell$ is not of the form $\frac 1n$ there exists a function of this form on whose graph one cannot inscribe a horizontal chord of length $\ell$. The first part can be proven like this:
Consider $g: [0,(n-1)/n] \to \mathbb R$ given by $g(x) = f(x) - f(x+1/n)$. Then $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} g(k/n) = 0$$ and therefore either all of these points are zero or there exists both a point where $g$ is positive and a point where $g$ is negative. By continuity, there must then also be a point where $g = 0$. So we are done. Now, the second statement seemed rather counterintuitive, and I have given it some time now, but don't see a counterexample for $\ell < 1/2$.

Similarly, I can show that $TS^3$ is a trivial bundle. Identify $\mathbb{H}$ with $\mathbb{R}^4$ and that that for $x \in S^3$ we have $x \mapsto ix$, $x \mapsto jx$ and $x \mapsto kx$ as orthogonal vectors, which are also orthogonal to $x$. Then we can see that there is an ismorphism $S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^4 \to S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ given by $(x,z) \mapsto (x,iz_1/x \times iz_2/x \times iz_3/x)$ where $z_1 = \{ t_1 i x| t_1 \in  \mathbb{R} \},z_2 = \{ t_2 j x| t_2 \in  \mathbb{R} \},z_3 = \{ t_3 k x| t_3 \in  \mathbb{R} \}$ (Possibly I haven't written that last bit so nicely).

This then leads onto the general question: Prove that $TS^{n-1}$ is a trivial bundle, if $\mathbb{R}^n$ may be provided with an $\mathbb{R}$-algebra structure without zero divisors.

Edit : Maybe the question should be - What property of $\mathbb{R}$-algebra structures without zero divisors, helps to solve this problem? Edit 2 : (The following is probably wrong). So assume that $\mathbb{R}^n$ has an $\mathbb{R}$ algebraic structure without zero divisors. We seek an isomorphism $$\phi:S^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}^n \to S^{n-1} \times \mathbb{R}^{n-1}.$$ Denote our algebraic structure by $\mathbb{T}$, and let it has orthonormal basis $\{ e_0, \cdots, e_{n-1} \}$. Then $S^{n-1}$ is the subset of $\mathbb{T}$ with (Euclidean norm) = 1 (I think I can still define the Euclidean norm?). Then given $z \in S^{n-1}$, $\{ ze_0, \cdots, ze_{n-1} \}$ is still an orthonormal basis (maybe). Then define the function $$(x,z) \mapsto (x,iz_1/x \times \cdots\times iz_{n-1}/x)$$ where $z_i = \{ t_i e_i x| t_i \in  \mathbb{R} \}$ (the division exists because $x$ is orthogonal to $z$ and we have no zero divisors)","['vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"
