910920,Angle between two planes in four dimensions,"Suppose I have two planes defined in 4D space, either in terms of
vectors spanning the planes, $X = t_1 A_1 + t_2 B_2$ and $X = t_3 A_3 + t_4 B_4$
(where $X$, $A$'s, and $B$'s are vectors with four elements and $t$'s are
scalars), or in terms of null space, $[C_1; D_1] X = 0$ and $[C_2; D_2] X = 0$
(where the matrices are $2$ x $4$ and $X$ has four elements). I understand
that these two planes generally intersect in just a single point
(unless the matrix $[C_1; D_1; C_2; D_2]$ is rank deficient). But is it
meaningful to ask what the angle is between the planes? If so, how
would it be computed? There is an explicit formula for the 3D case: simply the angle between the normals to the planes. Is there no equivalent explicit expression for the 4D case?",['linear-algebra']

910966,Strategies to guess choices for multiple choice questions,"Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are common in examinations over here in Singapore. A set of, say, $40$ questions are given to students, and each is accompanied with a list of $4$ choices of answer, $A, B, C$ or $D$. Suppose a student did not study for a particular test. Out of desperation, he decides to ""guess"" a choice for each question to secure at least some points. He considers two possible strategies: For each question, he picks a random choice as his answer. He picks a random choice, say, $B$ and uses it for all his answer. Assuming the correct answers are randomly distributed and his guess is completely random, which strategy would give a higher probability of securing more correct answers than the other? Intuitively, the second strategy would give a higher probability of securing more marks. However, I am unable to come up with a mathematical proof (or disproof). For the second strategy, we only need consider the probability that the correct answer is the choice that was picked. Under the assumption that the correct answers are randomly distributed, the probability of a particular choice being the correct answer is $\frac{1}{4}$. Hence, the student would get approximately $25\%$ of his guesses correct. However, we can also use the same argument for the first strategy to say that the student would also get approximately $25\%$ of his guesses correct. This would imply that both strategies are equally effective, but I am pretty sure the second strategy is more effective. EDIT: In order to prevent psychological factors from distorting reality,  I decided to write a program (in C#) that simulates the aforementioned MCQ tests. I configured the program to simulate the taking of $1000$ randomly generated MCQ tests with $40$ questions each using both strategies. It turns out that the percentage scores for both strategies have the same average ($\approx25\%$) and the same standard deviation ($\approx 6.84$)!

911011,Solving a system of first order differential equations,"So, I have (another) problem with differential equations (from an optimal control problem). I am trying to solve the following system of DEs (is this even a system?): $$ \lambda'(t) = r \lambda(t) + x' h(x(t)) \\ \lambda = g(x(t)) \\ \lambda(T) = 0, \quad x(0)=0 $$ with 
$x: [0,T] \to \mathbb{R}_+$ and $\lambda: [0,T] \to \mathbb{R}$ So, I thought, the 2nd equation is really simple (and $g$ has nice properties, including being cont. differentiable), so I tried to just try to get one DE in $x'$ and replace $\lambda$ with $g(x)$ and $\lambda'$ with $\frac{d g(x(t))}{d t} = x'g'(x(t))$. When I now try to solve the resulting initial value problem: $$ x'(t) g'(x(t)) = r g(x(t)) + x'(t) h(x(t)), \quad x(0) = 0$$ So this is the point when I realized: something went wrong. I completely ignored $\lambda(T) = 0$ and when trying to solve an example I get a solution which seems to be for a problem without $\lambda(T) = 0$ (big surprise!), which is clearly wrong for a finite $T$. So finally my question(s): What did I do wrong? And how can I fix it?

911050,What is the expected number of coin tosses needed to obtain a head?,"Due to my recent misunderstandings regarding the 'expected value' concept I decided to post this question. Although I have easily found the answer on the internet I haven't managed to fully understand it. I understood that the formula for the expected value is: $$E(x) = x_1p_1 +x_2*p_2 +...+x_np_n$$ The x's are the possible value that the random variable can take and the p's are the probabilites that this certain value is taken. So, if I get a head on the first try, then  $ p_1 = \frac{1}{2} , x_1 = 1 $
If I get a head on the second try, then $ p_2 = \frac{1}{4} , x_2 = 2 $ And then, I woudl have that: $$E(x) = \frac{1}{2}1+ \frac{1}{4}2 +...$$ So my reasoning led me to an inifnite sum which I don't think I can't evaluate it that easy. In the 'standard' solution of this problem, the expected value is found in a reccurisve manner. So the case in which the head doesn't appear in the first toss is treated reccursively. I haven't understood that step. My questions are: is my judgement correct? How about that reccursion step? Could somebody explain it to me?","['probability', 'expectation']"

From my understanding, if something is a 'power of 2' it is 2 to a power, with nothing else, no other prime factors.  That would make $AC$ equal to $2^{2n+1} ,n\ge0$ because it is twice $AB$ which must then be $2^{2n}$ as the only prime factor in $AC$ is 2 and $AB$ is a perfect square.

My attempt: The given statement is equivalent to: $X$ is equipotent to a proper subset of itself $\Leftrightarrow$ $X$ is infinite Case '$\Rightarrow$': $X$ is equipotent to a proper subset of itself means that if $A \subset X$, then there exists a bijection $A\rightarrow X$. Therefore, $|A|=|X|$. But $A\subset X$ implies $|A|<|X|$ This is a contradiction but I am not doing a proof by contradiction so I this outcome is strange to me. I know that $|A|<|X|$ then no bijection $A \rightarrow X$ can exist. But the bijection must exist since we assumed $A$ and $X$ are equipotent. How do I resolve this and complete the proof? Case '$\Leftarrow$' I am stumped by the solution provided: The main problem I have is the inductive proof showing that $A$ is a denumerable subset. In the base case, the set $A$ has only 1 element, namely $a_1$, so, I don't see how it is possible to build a bijection $\mathbb{Z}^+\rightarrow \{x_1\}$ I don't even understand the inductive step as I don't know when the inductive hypothesis is used. In fact, I am not able to discern what the inductive hypothesis is.

911451,Checking understanding on proving uniqueness of identity and inverse elements of a group.,"Sorry for such a trivial question, but just wanted to check my understanding. When proving a statement, for example, that the inverse of a group element is unique (in elementary group theory) one starts by supposing that there exists two inverses $h$ and $k$ for a given element $g \in G$, where $G$ is some group with binary operation $\ast:G\times G \rightarrow G$, such that $h\ast g = g\ast h = e$  and $k\ast g = g\ast k = e$ where $e \in G$ is the unique identity for the group $G$. From this, one can show that $h=k$ in the following manner: $$ h=h\ast e =h\ast\left( g\ast k\right) = \left(h\ast g\right)\ast k = e\ast k =k$$ and as such $h=k$. 
Now, is the reason we can from this state that the inverse of an element $g\in G$ is unique because $h$ and $k$ were chosen arbitrarily, apart from the requirement that they are inverses of $g$, and as such, if we know the value of one of the inverses, say $h$, then we know that for any other value $k$ to be an inverse of $g$ it must be equivalent to the known inverse $h$, and thus $h$ is the unique inverse of $g$. Is this reasoning correct? Sorry for the wordiness of this question, but just wanted to check my understanding explicitly. Also, although I understand that, logically, I should have proven this first (but I'd already written out the inverses part before thinking of this, so apologies for that), but is the reasoning the same for arguing that the identity element of a group is unique? (i.e. If we assume that there are two identity elements $e,g \in G$ and subsequently show that $e=g$, then this implies that if we know the form of one of the identities, say $e$, then for any other value $g$ to be an identity of the group $G$ it must be equivalent to $e$ and thus the identity element of a group is unique).","['logic', 'proof-writing', 'group-theory']"
911468,Solvable implies quotient group is solvable: Proof check.,"I'd like to check the veracity of my proof. I've seen several proofs using different methods (some I'm allowed to use with lots of element-pushing and others using ideas I'm not allowed), but none explicitly like mine. First, a definition: Definition: A group $G$ is solvable if there is a chain of subgroups
$$ 1 = G_0 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_k =G$$
such that $G_{i+1}/G_{i}$ is abelian for $i = 0, 1, \dots, k-1.$ Problem: Quotient groups of a solvable group are solvable. Proof: Let $\overline{G}$ be the quotient of a solvable group $G$ by some normal subgroup $N$ of $G$. G is solvable so there is a chain: $$ 1 = G_0 \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft G_n =G$$ such that $G_{i+1}/G_{i}$ is abelian for $i = 0, 1, \dots, n-1$. By the lattice isomorphism theorem, $$G_{i} \triangleleft G_{i+1} \iff \overline{G_{i}} \triangleleft \overline{G_{i+1}}$$
so there is a chain:
$$ \overline{1} = \overline{G_{0}} \triangleleft \dots \triangleleft \overline{G_{n}} = \overline{G}$$
for the quotient group. Now, by the 3rd isomorphism theorem, we have $$ \overline{G_{i+1}} / \overline{G_{i}} = (G_{i+1} / N)/(G_{i} / N) \cong G_{i+1} / G_{i}$$

In any case, I may have missed something in these posts so please do recommend a post if you think it will help me. Thank you very much for your time, in advance. We show that the following statement is equivalent to the axiom of choice: For any set $A$, there is a function $F$ with $dom \ F = \bigcup A$ such that $x \in F(x) \in A$ for all $x \in \bigcup A$. Call this statement $S$. To prove that $S$ is equivalent to the axiom of choice, we show that $S$ holds iff version 4 of the axiom of choice holds (p.151): Let $A$ be a set such that (a) each member of $A$ is a nonempty set, and (b) any two distinct members of $A$ are disjoint. Then there exists a set $C$ containing exactly one element from each member of $A$ (i.e., for each $B \in A$, the set $C \cap B$ is a singleton $\{x\}$ for some $x$. Call this version $S'$. First, we show that $S \ \implies \ S'$. Assume that $S$ holds and that $A$ is a set such that each member is a nonempty set and any two members of $A$ are disjoint. Then, there is a function $f$ such that $dom \ f = \bigcup A$ and $\forall x \in \bigcup A$ ($x \in f(x) \in A$). We now have $dom \ f \subseteq ran \ f \in A$, and so  $ran \ f  \neq \emptyset$ by the definition of $A$. Further, we have $ran \ f \ \cap \ B = \{f(x)\}$, for some $x \in A$ and for any $B \in A$.

\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi)) : \text{Sym}^2T^*M \to \text{Sym}^2T^*M
$$
has dimension at least $n = \dim M$ for $\xi \neq 0$. Basically, differentiating this invariance gives a complex
$$
0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M\overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M
$$
for $\delta_g^*$ the $L^2$ adjoint of the divergence operator acting on $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$. So if we show that in fact $\ker(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $n$ by showing that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g))$ has dimension $\frac12n(n-1)$, we will know that all the non-ellipticity is caused by this invariance. Now conversely, to what extent does the non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}$ implies its invariance under diffeomorphisms? I feel like Chow and Knopf's discussion is trying to adress this but I'm not completely satisfied with my understanding. What they do is show that the invariance wrt flows associated to vector fields implies the second contracted Bianchi identity
$$
\nabla^jR_{ij} = \frac12\nabla_iR
$$
which in turn implies an infinitesimal version of the invariance, namely
$$
((D\text{Ric}_g) \circ \delta_g^*)(\alpha) = \frac12\mathcal{L}_{\alpha^{\sharp}}(\text{Ric}_g)
$$
for $\alpha$ a 1-form. They claim that this means the contracted second Bianchi identity is equivalent to the invariance of the Ricci tensor under diffeomorphisms but isn't this identity strictly weaker than the Bianchi identity? In any case, they then express the contracted second Bianchi identity as $B_g(\text{Ric}(g)) = 0$ for
$$
B_g : C^{\infty}(\text{Sym}^2T^*M) \to C^{\infty}(T^*M)
$$
the Bianchi operator given by $B_g(h)_k = g^{ij}(\nabla_ih_{jk} - \frac12\nabla_kh_{ij})$. Then to show that the kernel of $\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g(\xi))$ is actually $n$-dimensional, they continue the sequence of symbols:
$$
0 \to T^*M \overset{\sigma(\delta_g^*)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(D \text{Ric}_g)(\xi)}\longrightarrow \text{Sym}^2T^*M \overset{\sigma(B_g)(\xi)} \longrightarrow T^*M \to 0.
$$
The contracted second Bianchi identity reading $B_g \circ \text{Ric}_g = 0$, it implies that $\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)) \subset \ker(\sigma(B_g))$ and a little analysis of $\sigma(B_g)$ actually shows that this sequence is exact. But this means that $\dim(\text{im}(\sigma(D\text{Ric}))) = \frac12n(n-1)$ as wanted because then $\dim(\ker\sigma(B_g)(\xi)) = \frac12n(n-1)$. Let's call the dimension of $\ker\sigma(D\text{Ric}_g)$ the number of degrees of non-ellipticity of $\text{Ric}_g$. I'd like to read the equivalence from this exact sequence as follows: The exactness at the first $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$ is a consequence of the invariance of $\text{Ric}$ under diffeomorphisms and contributes $n$ degrees of non-ellipticity to $\text{Ric}$. Conversely, if there are exactly $n$ degrees of non-ellipticity, this would imply the exactness at the second $\text{Sym}^2T^*M$ by counting dimensions, which (infinitesimally, at the level of symbols) is the contracted second Bianchi identity, which might imply the invariance under diffeomorphisms of $\text{Ric}$. Is there any way to make this last argument rigorous? I really don't see how I can go from a statement on the symbol of the linearization of an operator to the analogous statement on the actual operator. Any vague ideas would be appreciated! If it helps, I'm reading this to try and really understand the idea behind deTurck's trick of ""killing diffeomorphism invariance to make Ricci flow parabolic"". I'd like to get a proof of the parabolicity of Ricci-deTurck flow without even having to calculate its symbol.","['ricci-flow', 'riemannian-geometry', 'partial-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

911787,Clarify Cartesian Products and Binary Operations,"Tell me if I'm saying this right. A Cartesian Product is a function $f:X \times Y \to Z$ , where some unknown structural operation on the sets $X$ and $Y$ produces a set $Z$ as its codomain, and $Z$ is a set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$ for all possible values of $x$ and $y$ . And codomain, while kind of arbitrarily defined, is generally the set of all possible values output by $f$ , the set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ . Good, so far? Now,  tell me if I'm describing binary operations right. Now a binary operation, it seems, is a cartesian product $f: Y \times Y \to Y$ , where $f$ , an unknown structural operation, operates on the sets $Y$ and $Y$ (which are for all purposes identical) and produces a set $Y$ (identical to the first two) as its codomain. Codomain has the same definition has earlier. Okay, here's where I get really confused regarding binary operations. From the first definition, it seems that a Cartesian Product is always a set of ordered pairs, but a binary operation is not producing ordered pairs of elements, but single elements that are also members of the set from which the two elements being operated on are members. Could anyone help me make sense of, help me bridge this—how do I say?—cognitive dissonance? Thanks.","['binary-operations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"
911792,"3-sigma Ellipse, why axis length scales with square root of eigenvalues of covariance-matrix","This is my first post on math.stackexchange and i am not a mathematician, but i took some undergrad math courses and some grad mathematical modelling courses, so i come with a basic understanding of math and computed a lot of eigenvectors and eigenvalues already... I hope my notation can be understood easily. I am trying to describe a two dimensional scatter plot by 3 parameter, which define the shape of an ellipse (i.e. length of major-axis, length of minor-axis and the angle between the major-axis and the ordinate of a cartesian coordinate system. The reason for this is, the scatter-plot changes over time and i want to track that change by tracking the change of those 3 parameters, i.e. the shape of the ellipse. I do not need a confidence-region or anything like this, just the parameters of an ellipse, fitting to my data. All i have given (and need) is the x- and y-coordinates of the scatter plot. I understand that the eigenvectors of the covariance-matrix give me orientation of the major- and minor-axis, which gives me the angle between major-axis and ordinate (just as in a principal component analysis). What I do not understand is, how do I get the length of the major- and minor-axis from the covariance matrix. I found two different approaches: Similar post on math.stackexchange linking to this source code on Wikipedia . They do a Cholesky-Decomposition of the Covariance matrix and transform a unit-circle with it. I cannot follow this mathematically, nor do i know why this would be correct. Similar post on stackoverflow They define the width and the height (i.e. length of the major- and minor-axis) as 2 * nstd * np.sqrt(vals), where nstd is denotes the n-th standard deviation which. In my case this would be 3. I can follow the second approach better, used the python code and the result looks great! But i do not understand why the length of the axis scales with the square root of the eigenvalues. I think that there must be a simple relation between the eigenvalue of a covariance matrix and the standard deviation of the projected data to the ellipse-axis, which i just cannot find in the literature and which i cannot derive myself. Can anyone enlighten me on this or help me to find something to read, such i can understand this better. Best, Nras. Update: I got the Textbook ""Circular Statistics in Biology"" from Batchelet, 1981. On pp.268-274 they calculate the semi-axis and the inclination angle for an example with $\sigma_1=3$ and $\sigma_2=2$ and with the correlation coefficient $\rho=0.4$. This yields the covariance matrix $$\begin{align*}   Cov & =\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   \sigma_1^2 & \rho\sigma_1\sigma_2\\
   \rho\sigma_1\sigma_2 & \sigma_2^2\\
  \end{array} } \right] \\
&= \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
   9.0 & 2.4\\
   2.4 & 4.0\\
  \end{array} } \right]
\end{align*}$$
and go through the equations 14.4.8 to 14.4.11 and find the results $$a=3.157, b=1.742, \Theta=21.9^\circ$$ The result just magically appears, as i cannot find the referenced equations, they stop after 14.4.7, right before this example and the chapter finishes after the example. What a pity! Running the Code in python, where the semi-axis length is defined by the square root of the eigenvalue, i obtain the same result: import numpy
cov = numpy.array([[9., 2.4], [2.4, 4.]])
eigenvals, eigenvecs = numpy.linalg.eig(cov)
numpy.sqrt(eigenvals)
numpy.rad2deg(numpy.arccos(eigenvecs[0, 0])) The output is as follows: array([ 3.1568251,  1.7419688])
21.915430336046288 So there must be something that explains why the ellipse semi-axis length scales with the square root of the eigenvalue. I now know that it is true, but still do not know why. Update2: The referenced equations really do not exist, but the calculation is sketched in the previous chapter 13.8. Summary: Let the Distributions 1 and 2 be centered at $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, respectively and and let 
$$ A=\sigma_2^2,\quad B=-\rho\sigma_1\sigma_2,\quad C=\sigma_1^2,\quad D=(1-\rho^2)\sigma_1^2\sigma_2^2$$ then the Ellipse follows the equation $$ A(x-\mu_1)^2 + 2B(x-\mu_1)(y-\mu_2) + C(y-\mu_2)^2 = D$$
From that equation the semi-axis length and inclination of the major-axis is computed as follows: Let $$R=[(A-C)^2 + 4B^2]^{1/2}$$ then the semi-major-axis $a$ and the semi-minor-axis $b$ can be computed as $$b, a = \left(\dfrac{2D}{A+C\pm R}\right)^{1/2}$$ and for the inclination $$\Theta = \arctan\left(\dfrac{2B}{A-C-R}\right)$$
Substituting in the values from the example yields the exact same solution as the approach with the square root of the eigenvalues and the inclination which can be obtained from the arccos of the eigenvector. From here it cannot be fare to show that $a=\sqrt{\lambda_1}$ and $b=\sqrt{\lambda_2}$ if $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.","['numerical-linear-algebra', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'covariance']"

(And if you know, what properties does your choosing system have?) I see the main problem that the 'best' candidate could be in the interview where the least number of group members attend. (Another problem would be whether the final decision should be made after all the interviews (so that each member could make a priority list) or rather that each member should cast his 'vote' (in any form) at each of the interviews.) PS: In the end the system still needs to be so simple that the group of non-mathematicians will grasp it without hours of lecutres about the topic=) PPS: I think I should tell what system I suggested: Each member should make a priority list of those candidates who's interview he attended. That means someone who attended all interviews distributes 3,2,1,0 points to the four candidates, thos who only attended in three interviews distributes 2,1,0 points to the three candidates who's interview he attended.

Does $S(x)$ approach a limit as $x$ approaches $1$ from below, and if so what is this limit? Proof     Since $S$ satisfies the functional equation $S(x) = x − S(x^2)$,

Every men did the decant only once. Now i have to find out how much juice was in every cup before they started the decant. Obviously the last man has got 0 liter juice because he is the last man who did the decant, so if the procedure ends he will have no juice in his cup, so when they began he had no juice. My Problem is I don't know how I have to solve this problem. Hope you can help me. 
I have got after the procedure of decant. $(1) = \frac{7^6 * (1) + 7^5 * 6 * (2) + 7^4 *6^2*(3) + 7^3 * 6^3*(4) + 7^2*6^4*(5) + 7*6^5(6)}{6^7}$ $(2) = \frac{9031*7*(1) + 9031*6*(2) + 7^4*6^2*(3) + 7^3*6^3*(4) + 7^2*6^4*(5) + 7*6^5*(6)}{6^7}$ $(3) = \frac{1105*7^2*(1) + 1105*7*6*(2) + 1105*6^2*(3) + 7^3*6^3*(4) + 7^2*6^4*(5) + 7*6^5*(6)}{6^7}$ $(4) = \frac{127*7^3*(1) + 127*7^2*6*(2) + 127*7*6^2*(3) + 127*6^3*(4) + 7^2*6^4(5) + 7*6^5*(6)}{6^7}$ $(5) = \frac{13*7^4*(1) + 13*7^3*6*(2) + 13*7^2*6^2*(3) + 13*7*6^3*(4) + 13*6^4*(5) + 7*6^5*(6)}{6^7}$ $(6) = \frac{7^5*(1) + 7^4*6*(2) + 7^3*6^2*(3) + 7^2*6^3*(4) + 7*6^4*(5) + 6^5*(6)}{6^7}$ $(7) = 0$ This is what I have got. My main problem is to show why $\frac{6}{7}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{7}$ and $0$ is the single solution for my problem.

912175,Symmetric Algebra and Extension of Scalars,"I am reading Gortz and Wedhorn's Algebraic Geometry. In their section on the symmetric algebra they explain the adjoint situation 
$$ \mathrm{Sym}_A \dashv i_A\colon \mathrm{Alg}(A)\to \mathrm{Mod}(A)$$
where $\mathrm{Sym}_A\colon M \mapsto \bigoplus_{i=0}^\infty T^n(M)/{\sim}$, with $T^n(M)=M\otimes_A\cdots \otimes_A M$ and $\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by $x\otimes y-y\otimes x$ and $i_A$ is just the inclusion. In passing they say given any ring morphism $f\colon A\to B$ this adjunction gives us the isomorphism
$$
\mathrm{Sym}_A(M)\otimes_A B \cong \mathrm{Sym}_B(M\otimes_A B).
$$
In other words, the formation of symmetric algebras commutes with extension of scalars. The proof I have uses the adjointness of the extension and restriction of scalars to arrive at
$$
\mathrm{Alg}(B)(\mathrm{Sym}_B(M\otimes_A B),R)\cong \mathrm{Alg}(B)(\mathrm{Sym}_A(M)\otimes_AB, R)
$$
for any test object $R$. Hence by Yoneda, we have our iso. My question: Do we need to use the restriction and extension of scalars adjoint properties to arrive at the solution? It seems the authors suggested we could verify it simply by the $\mathrm{Sym}\dashv i$ adjoint.","['category-theory', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'modules']"

Questions: What is the connection between equicontinuous and equisummable, and how to connect between $C(X)$ with $l^p$ , is there something similar for $L^p$ ? What is the intuition behind equicontinuous and equisummable? From my own understanding, in a infinite dimensional space say $l^p$ $(p<\infty)$ , because the metric or norm has to measure the quantity in every single one of the dimensions, there can be too much variation in each dimension for a closed and bounded set to be compact in the metric topology. The concept of equisummable would make this variation small. Is this correct? And what about equicontinuous? Thank you very much!","['compactness', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
912217,Log normal distribution - Where am I wrong?,"Let $X$ be a R.V whose pdf is given by

(1-p)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_2^2}}\exp\left(-\frac{(x-\mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2}\right)$$ clearly $X\sim pN(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)+(1-p)N(\mu_2,\sigma_2^2)=N(p\mu_1+(1-p)\mu_2,p^2\sigma_1^2+(1-p)^2\sigma_2^2)$ therefore $\kappa=E(e^X)-1=e^{p\mu_1+(1-p)\mu_2+\frac{1}{2}(p^2\sigma_1^2+(1-p)^2\sigma_2^2)}-1$.

$G(y)=P(Y<y)=P(e^X<y)=p(X<\ln(y))=F_X(\ln(y))$

912232,Prove that every Lebesgue measurable function is equal almost everywhere to a Borel measurable function,"Suppose $(\mathbb{R},\Sigma(m),m)$ is our measure space, where $m$ is Lebesgue measure.  Also, suppose $f : \mathbb{R} \to [-\infty, \infty]$ is a Lebesgue measurable function. The problem: Prove that $f$ is equal almost everywhere to a Borel measurable function. My attempt: We only have to prove this assertion for a non-negative Lebesgue measurable function $f$ because the result will follow for all Lebesgue measurable functions. Furthermore, since any Lebesgue measurable function can be approximated by a sequence of non-negative, monotonically increasing, Lebesgue measurable simple functions $s_{n}$, we only need to prove the claim for an arbitrary Lebesgue measurable simple function. So, let $s: \mathbb{R} \to [-\infty, \infty] $ be a Lebesgue measurable simple function.  We can write $s$ canonically as $$ s(x) = \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{n} \alpha_{i} \chi_{A_{i}}(x)$$ where $\alpha_{i} \in [-\infty, \infty]$, $\bigcup \limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i} = \mathbb{R}$, and $A_{i} \cap A_{j} = \emptyset$ if $i \neq j$. For each $i$, since $A_{i}$ is Lebesgue measurable, we can find a Borel set $B_{i}$ such that $A_{i} \subseteq B_{i}$ and $m(B_{i} \setminus A_{i}) = 0$.  Clearly, this implies that $\bigcup \limits_{i = 1}^{n} B_{i} = \mathbb{R}$.  Now we just need the $B_{i}$'s to be pairwise disjoint, with each $B_{i}$ still retaining $A_{i}$. To make them pairwise disjoint, I constructed the following sets: $\tilde{B_{i}} = [B_{i} \setminus (\bigcup \limits_{j \neq i} B_{j})] \cup A_{i}$.  This construction gives us that the $\tilde{B_{i}}$'s are pairwise disjoint (I think....) and $A_{i} \subseteq \tilde{B_{i}}$.  But I don't know that $\tilde{B_{i}}$ is necessarily still a Borel set. :( :(  Am I approaching this problem all wrong?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
