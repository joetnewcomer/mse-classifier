574137,Reference on Doob's h-transform,"I am searching for a reference about conditioning a Markov process in the sense of Doob, i.e. using h-transforms. My particular concern is to condition a discrete-time Markov Process on a possibly null-measure event, and I would need results such as conditions for uniqueness of extremal harmonic functions , maybe results related to Green's functions... I found : The (big) book of Doob, Classical potential theory and its probabilistic counterpart which is very general and would need a substantial investment to be understood. The book of Rogers and Williams Diffusions, Markov processes and martingales , which is not very detailed, and mainly deals with the continuous time case.

574160,"Does convergence of $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \int h d\mu_n$ for all continuous, bounded $h$ imply weak convergence of $(\mu_n)$?","Let $(\mu_n)$ be a sequence of positive finite Borel measures on $\mathbb{R}$.

My try: Multiplying the second equation by $xy$, we get $6xy^4 = 3x^4y +x^2y^4$ Now substituting $x^2y^4$ in the first equation, we get $$2x^5 = 6xy^4-3x^4y+9y^5.$$ Rearranging, $2x^5+3x^4y = 6xy^4+9y^5$ so $$x^4(2x+3y) = 3y^4(2x+3y).$$ You can get a relation between $x$ and $y$ from the last equation and substitute back in any one of the original equation to get real values for $x$ and $y$. $$(x^4-3y^4)(2x+3y) = 0$$ You will have two relations and substituting back in the original equation will get the real values.

574323,Can I specify the edge lengths of a simplicial polyhedron?,"Let $X$ be a convex polyhedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose faces are all triangles, and let $\ell$ be a function which assigns a positive real number to each edge of $X$. We say that $\ell$ is realizable if there exists a convex polyhedron isomorphic to $X$ whose corresponding edge lengths are given by $\ell$. My question is: Under what conditions will $\ell$ be realizable? There are two obvious conditions that $\ell$ must satisfy: For each triangle $a,b,c$ of edges, the numbers $\ell(a),\ell(b),\ell(c)$ must satisfy the triangle inequality. If we compute the ""angles"" of each triangle using the law of cosines, then the sum of the angles at any vertex must be less than $2\pi$. Are these conditions sufficient?  Or are there hidden obstructions to specifying the edge lengths of a simplicial polyhedron? Note: I'm pretty sure the given conditions are sufficient in the case where $X$ is a tetrahedron (see the argument in my comment below), so the first case that I'm not sure about is the octahedron.","['geometry', 'polyhedra']"

574383,Measurability of the pushforward operator on measures,"Let $X$, $Y$ and $Y'$ be (standard) Borel spaces . We let $\mathcal B(X)$ be the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of $X$ and $\mathcal P(X)$ to be the space of all Borel probability distributions on $X$ endowed with the topology of weak convergence, so that it is a Borel space as well. Consider any Borel set $A\in \mathcal B(X\times \mathcal P(Y))$ and a pushforward operator $\pi_*:\mathcal P(Y\times Y')\to \mathcal P(Y)$ defined as
$$
  (\pi_*p)(B) =  p(B\times Y') \qquad \forall B\in \mathcal B(Y).
$$
What can we say about measurability of $A':=\{(x,p):\pi_*p\in A_x\}\subseteq X\times \mathcal P(Y\times Y')$, where
$$
A_x:=\{q\in \mathcal P(Y):(x,q)\in A\}.
$$ If I am not mistaken, we obtain $A' = (\mathrm{id}_X\times \pi_*)^{-1}(A)$, hence the question can be reduced to the measurability of the map $\pi_*$. I think, a more general result holds true. Let $(\Omega,\mathcal F)$ and $(\Omega',\mathcal F')$ be arbitrary measurable spaces,
and let $\mathcal P$ be a set of all probability measures on $(\Omega,\mathcal F)$ endowed with a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal A$ generated by evaluation maps $\theta_F:\mathcal P \to \Bbb R$ given by $\theta_F(p) = p(F)$ for any $F\in \mathcal F$ and $p\in \mathcal P$.
Let $(\mathcal Pi',\mathcal A')$ be a corresponding measurable space of probability measures for $(\Omega',\mathcal F')$ and denote by $\theta'_{F'}$ the corresponding evaluation maps.
For any measurable $\varphi:\Omega\to\Omega'$ it holds that $\varphi_*:\mathcal P\to\mathcal P'$ is measurable. Proof: note that for any $p\in \mathcal P$ and $F'\in \mathcal F'$ it holds that
$$
  \theta'_{F'}(\varphi_*p) = p(\varphi^{-1}(F')) = \theta_{\varphi^{-1}(F')}(p)
$$
hence $\theta'_{F'}\circ \varphi_* = \theta_{\varphi^{-1}(F')}$.
Since $\mathcal A'$ is generated by evaluation maps,
for the measurability of $\varphi_*$ it is necessary and sufficient that $\varphi_*^{-1}((\theta'_{F'})^{-1}(B))\in \mathcal A$ for any Borel $B\subseteq \Bbb R$.
The latter fact is true since
$$
  \varphi_*^{-1}((\theta'_{F'})^{-1}(B)) = (\theta'_{F'}\circ \varphi_*)^{-1}(B) = (\theta_{\varphi^{-1}(F')})^{-1}(B)\in \mathcal A
$$
since $\varphi^{-1}(F')\in \mathcal F$ and $\mathcal A$ is generated by maps $\theta_{F}$ with $F\in \mathcal F$.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'measure-theory', 'descriptive-set-theory']"

My feeling for this is I was running on the outside.

574443,Which polynomials are characteristic polynomials of a symmetric matrix?,"Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$.  There are well-known ways to construct a $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with entries in $\mathbb{Q}$ whose characteristic polynomial is $f$.  My question is: when is it possible to choose $A$ symmetric? An obvious necessary condition is that the roots of $f$ are all real, but it is not clear to me even in the case $n = 2$ that this is sufficient.  In degree $2$ this comes down to determining whether or not every pair $(p,q)$ which satisfies $p^2 > 4q$ (the condition that $x^2 + px + q$ has real roots) can be expressed in the form
$$p = -(a + c)$$
$$q = ac - b^2$$

574596,Relative effective Cartier divisors,"I have two different definitions of a relative effective Cartier divisor . The first one is a bit outdated and defines the notion over analytic spaces , in the following way: Definition 1: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve and $T$ an analytic space. A relative effective Cartier divisor on $X$ over $T$ is simply an effective Cartier divisor on the product $X\times T$ which does not contain any fiber of the projection $ X\times T \to T $ . The second definition is more modern (can be found for instance in the Stack project), and defines the notion over schemes: Definition 2: Let $S$ be a scheme and $X$ , $T$ be schemes over $S$ . A relative effective Cartier divisor on $X\,/\,T$ is a closed subscheme $D\subset X$ together with a flat morphism $f:D\to T$ , such that the ideal sheaf $\mathcal{I}_D$ of $D$ is invertible. Now, I'd like to understand the relashionship between the two definitions. I'm more interested in the modern, scheme-theoretic one and in particular I'd like to see if a $D$ as in definition 2 can be thought as a divisor on the fibred product $X\times T$ over $S$ . What I did so far is the following: we can write down the pullback diagram defining the fibered product and, using the given $f:D\to T$ and the inclusion $i:D\to X$ (how can I see the diagram commutes?) we get the dashed arrow. Should I think of the dashed morphism as the inclusion of $D$ as a codimension $1$ subscheme of $X\times T$ ?

He claims this map $\phi$ is defined and continuous in the whole strip and analytic in it's interior. Why is that so? The rest of the proof follows easily, since it's clear that $|\phi(\sigma+it)| \leq \phi(\sigma)$ for $0 \leq \sigma \leq 1$ and that $|\phi(it)|, |\phi(1+it)|$ are bounded by $1$ (so by the maximum modulus principle, $\phi(z) \leq 1$ in the whole strip and thus Holder's inequality holds (pun unintended) by taking $z=\frac{1}{q}$.","['measure-theory', 'complex-analysis']"

Background I need to programmatically find the center of a circle while I'm only able to see the outer edge of the circle. I am using matlab for my prototype of this. This was a class project. We finished the project using matlabs imfindcircles(), but it is to slow. It takes about 2-3 seconds to process a single image. I want to improve my programs speed and hopefully learn some math in the process. The initial assignment was to create a rifle that blind people could use. Below is a test image I am trying to process: Ignore the black around the outer edge. I have my camera behind a scope, that is why you can only see a small magnified circle in the middle. The black half circles are actually a target, so there are multiple rings nested inside each other. Also, I initially posted this question on stackoverflow as a programming issue. Feel free to read it for more information about the code behind my imfindcircles() solution and my attempted alternative. However, there are quite a few votes to close it.

Then show that $f$ is analytic. Now, when we consider the question for functions in some quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class some proofs I have seen don't carry over: Question: If $f^2$ is a function in some quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class , then $f$ is quasi-analytic belonging to the same class? Weierstrass preparation theorem doesn't hold in quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman classes, and it is an open problem whether a $C^\infty$ function that belongs to a quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class along every line belongs to that class. Two of the proofs I have seen for the first problem break down for quasi-analytic functions for this reason. Another open question in Denjoy-Carleman classes is about whether ideals are closed. For principal ideals this is related to solving for $f$ in $gf=h$, where $g$ and $h$ are known to belong to the Denjoy-Carleman class. The ideal generated by $g$ would not be closed if we can find a smooth $f$ that doesn't belong to the class such that it gets pushed into the class by the multiplication by $g$. In this way, the question above is about understanding whether a smooth function, not in the class, can be pushed into the class by multiplying by itself. If the square appears composed with $f$ on the other side then it is known to occur. This is, $f(x^2)$ may be in a quasi-analytic Denjoy-Carleman class while $f$ is not.","['several-complex-variables', 'complex-analysis']"

I'm studying complex variables and the method of calculating improper integrals with residues but I'm struggling a little with the contours. The teacher said that there is no general way to choose the contour, we can be lucky to find it and be able to solve the integral, or we don't solve the integral. And this sounded to me like finding $\delta$'s in proofs of continuity. This is a good example of what I'm trying to find out. Although there's no ""formula"" to find $\delta$ for every function, there are some steps, that when we take we can figure out our $\delta$ in one almost easy way in many cases. What we do is: we bound $|f(x)-f(a)|$ and try to make appear there things like $|x-a|$, $|x+a|$ and $|x|$, because all of those we can bound. After that, we look again, if there are things like $|x|$ and $|x+a|$, we enforce $|x-a|<1$ or something else, just to bound those things again. After that we look again, and we try to figure out what $|x-a|$ should be less than in order to make the whole thing less than $\epsilon$. Now, when I've learned about continuity in the beginning of the course the teacher said the same: there's no way, or you have creativity to choose $\delta$ or forget about it. But these are guidelines that helped me in the vast majority of cases, even in $\Bbb C$ and $\Bbb R^n$. So, is there a general method, general guidelines that I can follow to see what contour I should use?

575118,Orthogonal Procrustes Variant,"(author note: this question was also asked on mathoverflow ). The orthogonal Procrustes problem seeks a matrix $M$ that minimizes $||AM-B||_F$ subject to $M^TM=I$, where $M$ is $d\times d$ and both $A$ and $B$ are $n\times d$. Geometrically, $M$ rotates a set of $n$ vectors (the rows of $A$) so that they best align with another set of $n$ vectors (the rows of $B$) in a least-squares sense. It has been shown that there is an elegant closed-form solution to this problem, namely $M=UV^T$ where $A^TB=U\Sigma V^T$. I am interested in solving a similar problem and wondering if there is an equally elegant closed-form solution. Given vector sets $A$ and $B$ as before, I would like to find $M$ that makes the vectors in $A$ as ""orthogonal"" as possible to corresponding vectors in $B$.

575171,Galois Group of $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$,"So I want to show that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}})$ is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$ and determine its Galois group. My thoughts are as follows: Define $\alpha := \sqrt{2+\sqrt{2}}$. Then it is easily shown that $\alpha$ satisfies $\alpha^4-4\alpha^2+2=0$. Define $f(x) := x^4-4x^2+2$. Then $f$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein with $p=2$. So we have that $f$ is the irreducible polynomial for $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Further $|\mathbb{Q}(\alpha):\mathbb{Q}|=4$. For $\mathbb{Q}({\alpha})$ to be Galois, it must contain all roots of $f$. Define $K=\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ for convenience. Define $\alpha := \alpha_1$. Since $f$ has only even powers, we know that $-\alpha := \alpha_2$ is a root, and therefore contained in $K$ since $K$ is a field. We note that the other two roots are $\alpha_3=\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}$ and $\alpha_4=-\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2}}$. So in order to show $K$ is Galois, it must be shown that $\alpha_3$ and $\alpha_4$ lie in $K$. Now $\alpha_1^2=2+\sqrt2$ and so $\sqrt2 \in K$. Thus $-\sqrt2 \in K$ since $K$ is a field. Can somebody explain why $\alpha_3$ and $\alpha_4$ lie in $K$? Next we are to determine the Galois group of $K$. Assuming $K$ is Galois, since it has degree $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ (shown earlier), we know that its Galois group has size $4$. There are only two groups of size $4$, namely $V_4$ and $C_4$, the Klein four group and the cyclic group of order $4$.

I did my undergraduate degree in mathematics, taking a pretty heavy course load in theoretical math and doing really well in it. I decided not to proceed with math and am continuing on to a professional degree. However, every once in a while I have doubts about my decision because it was made on more than one basis, i.e. passion for a given academic subject. One of the reasons was that, seeing my professors, it seemed that mathematicians were very much living in a world of their own and every time I asked for an application of what I was studying, e.g. Galois theory, I got two sorts of answers: An application of the concept in another area of mathematics...which is not what I was looking for. A trivial application where a physical/computational/etc system is ""modelled"" with the concept, e.g. something is a ""group"", but the recognition that it is was completely useless since the application did not produce a result that would have been otherwise unknown . My question is: If I changed my mind, applied to do a graduate degree in mathematics and decided to work in a field outside of academia, would I have useful applications of what I studied (and not just a tiny fraction of what I studied, e.g. ODEs) in ""real"" life""?

I think you would really answer my question if you could give me an example of a real life problem (not in excessive detail) that was solved thanks to techniques of algebraic geometry.

Let $A$ be a finitely generated domain over a field $k$. We know by hypothesis that its fraction field $K(A)$ is a finite separable extension of a purely trascendental extension $k(T_1, \dots , T_d)$ of $k$ (follows from Noether's Normalization Lemma, right?). Then we can write $K(A)=k(T_1, \dots , T_d)[X]/(P(X))$ where $P$ is irreducible and separable polynomial and without loss of generality we can choose $P(X)$ in $k[T_1, \dots , T_d][X]$ by Gauss' lemma. Now my book says: There exists a localization $A_f$ of $A$ such that $k[T_1, \dots , T_d][X]/(P(X)) \subseteq  A_f$.

You should use Rolle’s Theorem at some point in the proof. Since $f(x) = x^7+x^5+x^3+1$ is a polynomial then it is continuous over all the real numbers, $(-\infty,\infty)$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous on $(-\infty,\infty)$ then it is certainly continuous on $[-1,0]$ and the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) applies. The IVT states that since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[-1,0]$ we can let $C$ be any number between $f(-1)=-2$ and $f(0)=1$, namely $C=0$, then there exists a number $c$ with $-1 < c < 0$ such that $f(c)=C=0$. Since $f(x)$ is continuous on $[-1,0]$ and differentiable on $(-1,0)$ then Rolle’s Theorem applies. Rolle’s Theorem states that if a function $f\colon [a,b] \to \mathbf{R}$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ then if $f(a)=f(b)$, there exists a point $c \in (a,b)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. We assume that there is more than one real solution for this equation, namely $f(a)=0=f(b)$. If there exists more than one real solution for $f(x)=0$ then $f(a)=0=f(b)\implies a=b$, and thus there is only one real solution to the equation, as desired.

Then $f(x) = y - 1 + 1 = y$. $\square$ Is my proof valid?","['proof-verification', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"
575620,Number of strings consisting of k ones and n zeros such that no two ones are adjacent,What is number of strings consisting of k ones and n zeros such that no two ones are adjacent? I already know the answer from wikipedia $\binom{n+1}{k}$ but i want to know its source.,['combinatorics']
575631,Ring of formal Laurent series over an Euclidean domain.,"If $R$ is a commutative Euclidean domain, then the ring $R((x))$ of formal Laurent series will also be an Euclidean domain. (Here we can assume that $R((x))$ is a commutative integral domain.) Additional information, I have: Let $F$ be a field and define the ring $F((x))$ of formal Laurent series with coefficients in $F$ as the set of all formal series of the form $\sum_{n \geq N} a_nx^n$ where $a_n \in F$ and $N \in \mathbb{Z}.$ Then $F((x))$ is a field. We can think of the elements of $F((x))$ as functions $\alpha : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow F$ with the property that there exists a minimal element $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\alpha(k) \neq 0$, together with the zero function. With this interpretation in mind, the notation $ \alpha = \sum_{n \geq N} a_n x^n $ means that $ a_n = 0 $ for all $n < N$; note that N is not necessarily maximal with this property. That is, if $a_n = 0$ for all $N \leq n < M$, then we also say $\alpha = \sum_{n \geq M} a_n x^n$. With this in mind, we define addition and multiplication on $F((x))$ as follows $$\left( \displaystyle\sum_{n \geq N} a_n x^n \right) + \left( \displaystyle\sum_{n \geq M} b_n x^n \right) 	 =  	\displaystyle\sum_{n \geq \min(N,M)} (a_n+b_n)x^n$$ $$\left( \displaystyle\sum_{n \geq N} a_n x^n \right) \cdot \left( \displaystyle\sum_{n \geq M} b_n x^n \right) 	 =  	\displaystyle\sum_{n \geq N+M} \left( \displaystyle\sum_{i+j=n} a_ib_j \right) x^n$$ For the definition of multiplication, note that for n an integer there are only finitely many pairs $(i,j)$ such that $i+j = 0, i \geq N$, and $j \geq M.$ Then we can check all the properties.","['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra']"
