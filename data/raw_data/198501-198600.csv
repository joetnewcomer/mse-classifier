3844482,can a real matrix have both a real minimal polynomial and complex characteristic polynomial?,"I had a test a few days ago, and I had a question there. can there be a real matrix where the minimal polynomial is $(x^2 - 3x + 2)$ and the characteristic polynomial is $(x^2 - 3x + 2)(x^2 - x + 2)$ ? I tried solving it for hours, and searched a lot for an answer.
also on that note, is it possible for a minimal polynomial to not have all the eigenvalues? such as in this case? edit: thank you for the answer, however, how do I prove this without the theorem?
can I prove this through the fact that it has 4 distinct eigenvalues, and therefore Diagonalizable?","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"
3844517,Relation of two Functions and Logic,"For two functions, $f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ , we define the set, $\Omega^g_f=\{x \in \mathbb{R}: f(x)<g(x) \}$ . We say that the function $f$ loves $g$ when $\forall x \in \Omega^g_f, \exists y \in \Omega^f_g $ such that $x<y$ . a) If $f$ loves $g$ , and $g$ loves $h$ , prove that $f$ loves $h$ . b) For any $t \in \mathbb{R}$ , let $f_t(x)=f(x)+t$ . For every function $f$ there exist a function $g$ such that, for every $t \in \mathbb{R}$ , $g$ loves $f_t$ . I already think a) is not true. I found a counterexample. Take $g(x)=\sin(x)$ , $h(x) = 0.5$ , $f(x) = -0.5$ . For b) I am not sure how to go about it since the question says 'there exists a function' so I have to consider all possible functions and only one has to work. I understand that $f_t$ is just translated up/down by $t$ units.","['logic', 'relations', 'real-analysis', 'functions', 'elementary-set-theory']"
3844518,Implications of Analyticity,"After reading the text on analyticity and viewing different theorems, somehow I made the following conclusions. Can please someone validate and throw some light on them? If a function is differentiable at a point $z_0$ , then the partial derivatives may or may not be continuous at that point. So, if the partial derivatives are continuous at that point, then this would imply analyticity at that point. And if the partial derivatives are not continuous at that point, then it will not be analytic at that point. However, if a function is analytic at a point $z_0$ , then this assures the existence of continuous partial derivatives at that point. Well it seems true to me, as differentiability at a point and differentiability at a point along with its some neighborhood are two different things. At last, Can I have an example of a function f(z) which is differentiable at a point $z_0$ but does not have continuous partial derivatives at that point? I know this can happen.","['complex-analysis', 'analytic-functions']"

3844798,Regarding the formal proof of De Morgan's law.,"Refering to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws#Part_1 , in the formal proof of De Morgan's Law, it was stated that Let $x \in (A\cap B)^c$ then $x \notin (A\cap B)$ . Because $A\cap B=\{y \mid y \in A \text { and } y\in B\}$ , it must be the case that $x\notin A$ or $x\notin B$ . What I can't comprehend is that they're saying that if $x$ is not common to both $A$ and $B$ , then $x$ doesn't belong in $A$ or in $B$ . How is that possible. For example if I were to say that $A=\{1,2,3,4,7,9\}$ and $B=\{7,8,9,11\}$ and say $x=3$ . So $A\cap B = \{7,9\}$ . Clearly $x=3\notin A\cap B$ . But in this case $x$ does belong to the set $A$ .

Let $\varphi : M \to N$ be a local diffeomorphism of smooth manifolds and $S \subset M$ a smooth submanifold such that $\varphi|_S: S \to N$ is an embedding. Is there a neighbourhood $U$ of $S$ in $M$ such that $\varphi|_U$ is injective? My guess is that we can achieve this by taking a neighbourhood $U$ which deformation retracts onto $S$ . This can be done, for example, by taking a tubular neighbourhood, i.e. a diffeomorphism from a neighbourhood of the zero section in the normal bundle of $S$ to a neighbourhood of $S$ in $M$ , and contracting by scalar multiplication. Then, there is perhaps an argument using path liftings, but I'm unsure how to do this.

3845080,Linearly dependent vector fields that are not spanned by fewer (continuous) vector fields.,"Consider the following continuous vector fields in $\mathbb{C}^3$ : \begin{equation*}
w_1(x,y,z):=(x,y,0), \; \; w_2(x,y,z):=(-z,0,y), \;\; w_3(x,y,z):= (0,z,x).
\end{equation*} At every point $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{C}^3$ , the vectors are linearly dependent, as the matrix \begin{pmatrix}
x & y & 0 \\ -z & 0 & y \\ 0 & z & x
\end{pmatrix} has determinant zero. In particular, this means that at each point there are two vectors $v_1, v_2$ that linearly generate $w_1,w_2,w_3$ at that point. Choosing such a pair of vectors at each point we end up with two vector fields $v_1(x,y,z),v_2(x,y,z)$ which span the other three as $w_i(x,y,z) = \alpha_i(x,y,z)v_1(x,y,z) + \beta_i(x,y,z) v_2(x,y,z)$ for some functions $\alpha_i, \beta_i : \mathbb{C}^3 \rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ . The question is, can there be two continuous vector fields $v_1, v_2$ with that property? (that they span $w_1,w_2,w_3$ at all points). I strongly suspect that this is not the case, but I am not sure how to approach this. Am I missing some obvious condition the vector fields should satisfy for this to be true? I am actually interested in a higher dimensional example, so I am looking for a general proof strategy or hints on how to attack this problem in general rather than a trick that works for this particular example.","['vector-fields', 'linear-algebra']"

3845218,What does it mean when the extension of scalars is free?,"In this post ""ring"" means ""commutative ring with identity"". Background: Let $\varphi : R \to S$ be a ring homomorphism. This gives us a functor $\varphi_!:= -\otimes_R S : \textbf{Mod}_R \to \textbf{Mod}_S$ often called the extension of scalars . This functor is left adjoint to the restriction of scalars, and therefore preserves colimits, and in particular direct sums. As a result, if $M$ is a free $R$ -module, then $M \otimes_R S$ is a free $S$ -module of the same rank. Question: I'm interested in the opposite question: What can be said about an $R$ -module $M$ if $M \otimes_R S$ is a free $S$ -module? What about the case when $M \otimes_R S$ is free of rank $1$ ? Here's a possibly useful reframing of the question. The extension of scalars functor corresponds to the pullback of quasicoherent sheaves. The question then becomes, what can be said about a quasicoherent sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ on $\text{Spec}(R)$ if its pullback via $\text{Spec}(\varphi) : \text{Spec}(S) \to \text{Spec}(R)$ is free?

3845538,Can we define a derivative on the $p$-adic numbers?,"Or on any complete valuated field, really. This question came to me when I was thinking about real and complex differentiability, which we can define in a very similar manner: Let $\mathbb F\in\{\mathbb R,\mathbb C\}$ , and $V,W$ normed, finite dimensional vector spaces over $\mathbb F$ . Also let $f:V\to W$ . We call $f$ $\mathbb F$ -differentiable at $x_0\in V$ if there is an $\mathbb F$ -linear map $\mathrm Df_{x_0}:V\to W$ such that $$\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\Vert f(x)-f(x_0)-\mathrm Df_{x_0}(x-x_0)\Vert}{\Vert x-x_0\Vert}=0.$$ This gives us a very natural way to talk about the real or complex differentiability of a function $\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$ , for instance. Just consider $\mathbb C$ a two-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb R$ or a one-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb C$ . I'm wondering wether this can be generalized in an interesting way. This is my idea: We would need a generalization of a norm to general fields, and of course we would still need to work in complete spaces. Norms can be generalized using a valuation: Let $\mathbb F$ be a field. A valuation is a map $\vert\cdot\vert:\mathbb F\to\mathbb R$ satisfying the following for all $a,b\in\mathbb F$ : $\vert a\vert\geq0$ and $\vert a\vert=0$ iff $a=0$ . $\vert ab\vert=\vert a\vert\vert b\vert$ . $\vert a+b\vert\leq\vert a\vert+\vert b\vert$ . Now let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb F$ . A norm on $V$ is a map $\Vert \cdot\Vert:V\to\mathbb R$ satisfying the following for all $v,w\in V,~a\in \mathbb F$ : $\Vert v\Vert\geq0$ and $\Vert v\Vert=0$ iff $v=0$ . $\Vert av\Vert=\vert a\vert\Vert v\Vert$ . $\Vert v+w\Vert\leq\Vert v\Vert+\Vert w\Vert$ . A norm on $V$ induces a metric $\Vert x-y\Vert$ . We can now consider finite-dimensional, normed vector spaces $V,W$ over $F$ which are complete with respect to the induced metric, and are free to define: A function $f:V\to W$ is $\mathbb F$ -differentiable in $x_0\in V$ if there exists an $\mathbb F$ -linear map $\mathrm Df_{x_0}:V\to W$ such that $$\lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{\Vert f(x)-f(x_0)-\mathrm Df_{x_0}(x-x_0)\Vert}{\Vert x-x_0\Vert}=0.$$ Now the question is wether such a definition is actually interesting. For instance, finite fields and finite-dimensional vector spaces over them will be discrete, so while they are complete, evaluating the above limit is still not possible. But I imagine infinite fields, like the $p$ -adic numbers, complex $p$ -adic numbers, or function fields, could make the definition a sensible one. Has such a thing been done before? Are there any obstacles to the well-definedness? Or something that would make the theory of such derivatives uninteresting?","['differential', 'p-adic-number-theory', 'analysis', 'valuation-theory']"
3845636,Constrained minimization: characterizing derivatives of optimum with respect to parameters,"Suppose I have a function $f(x,y)$ defined on $[0,1]^2$ that is equal to the value of the following constrained minimization problem: $$f(x,y) = min_{a\in [0,1-x),\ b\in[0,x)}\ \left\{ h(x,a) + g(x,b) \right\}\ \text{subject to } a+b=y$$ Here is some relevant information about $h$ and $g$ . First, $h(x,0)=g(x,0)$ for all $x$ . Second, $\lim_{a\rightarrow 1-x} h(x,a)=\infty$ and $\lim_{b\rightarrow x}g(x,b)=\infty$ (this is why I write the feasible sets as partially open intervals). I am interested in an analytical characterization of the partial derivatives $f_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)$ in terms of the partial derivatives of $h$ and $g$ . My envelope theorem is super rusty, and the simplicity of both the objective and the constraint make me think there is a relatively easy solution here that I am missing. Note this is not homework (I am not a student, but rather an old professor who has come to rely perhaps too heavily on numerical methods for his own good). Here is my logic so far: (i) The simplest case is if $x=0$ , where $b=0$ and $a=y$ by construction. Obviously in this case $f(0,y)$ = $h(0,y)$ for all $y$ . Then $f_x(0,y) = h_x(0,y)$ and $f_y(0,y) = h_a(0,y)$ . (ii) If $x>0$ but we have a corner solution (either $a=0$ or $b=0$ ), the answer is still pretty simple. If $a=0$ then $f_x(x,y)=g_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y)=g_b(x,y)$ . If $b=0$ then $f_x(x,y) = h_x(x,y)$ and $f_y(x,y) = h_a(x,y)$ as in (i). (iii) For interior solutions, the first-order conditions imply $h_a(x,a^*(x,y))=g_b(x,b^*(x,y))$ , where $a^*(x,y)$ and $b^*(x,y)$ are the argmins. I am thinking $f_y(x,y)=h_a(x,a^*(x,y))=g_b(x,b^*(x,y))$ in this case. At the margin, allocating a small increase in y to a or b should have the same effect on the objective.

The University of Arizona Tucson, Arizona, USA Here is one way to define $A$ in set-builder notation: $$A = \{x | x \text{ is an even integer}\} \text. \tag{9.1}$$ In general, set-builder notation takes the form $$S = \{x | P(x) \text { is true}\} \text, \tag{9.2}$$ where $P(x)$ is some mathematical statement. We read this definition of the set $S$ as "" $S$ is the set of all $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true"". So $s \in S$ if and only if $P(s)$ is true; $s \notin S$ if and only if $P(s)$ is false. There are some common variations on set-builder notation that you will see. For example, people will often use a colon "":"" in place of the bar ""|"". That is fine; the idea is the same. Sometimes, another condition on elements of a set is slipped in before the ""such that"" symbol by limiting elements to members of a larger set. For example, we could have defined the set of even integers as this: $$A = \{x \in \mathbb Z | x \text { is even}\} \text. \tag{9.3}$$ Besides using English or set-builder notation to define sets, we can define sets
by simply listing their elements. For example, we can write $$A = \{\dots, −6, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, \dots\} \tag{9.4}$$ to define the set of all even integers. But this really only works when the set is small enough that all of its elements can be reasonably listed or when the pattern is strong enough to be recognized. For example, we could write $$B = \{n \in \mathbb N | 2 \le n \le 5\} \text { or } B = \{2, 3, 4, 5\} \text. \tag{9.5}$$ This is all the information from the book that I could find that is pertaining to the purposed question.

3845890,Complex scalar fields on real manifolds.,"I have a real smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $d$ . What I want to do is construct scalar fields on $M$ over $\mathbb C$ so that I can do derivatives(parametrized by spacetime, say, a 4 dimensional real manifold). If $f:M\to\mathbb C$ , I guess I could do $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w^i}=\dfrac{\partial w^j}{\partial z^i}\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial w^j}$ (given some charts) as basis transformations. The problem is that each basis $z_i$ needs two real numbers to be defined, so the tangent bundle needs to have dimension $3d$ (I think). So, for the dimension of the tangent bundle to be double the dimension of the base, either the manifold is complex(with complex coordinates, which I don't want) or the field is real(which I also don't want). I have read(wiki) that scalar fields can be complex, without much difference on which approach you take, which makes sense because, in QFT, the lagrangian(which is a function $TM\to\mathbb C$ ) is taken as if it was a real field and there is no distinction between a complex and real field, you just have a spacetime and assign a complex number to every point, that's it. I have read about almost complex structures , which is defined as a particular linear map in the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold(note it does not say anything about the manifold apart from it being smooth). Is this the structure I need? If I have an almost complex structure, what is the dimension of $TM$ (given $M$ has real dimension $d$ ), and, more importantly, what is $TM$ ? What are its basis? How does basis vectors change, is my intuition of chart transitions correct? Do the dimension of $TM$ remain as double the dimension of $M$ ? Either way, It seems I have a lot of questions, but I cannot find any book or reference that explains how complex fields are defined on real manifolds without going to the complex manifolds realm(maybe there aren't, for my surprise!). Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: I Sorry, I didn't say it, but the goal is to generalize to complex vectors, instead of solely scalars, so when I said above derivatives, I really meant partial and covariant derivatives.

3845906,Help showing that every subset of a countably infinite set is countable,"Here is the definition I am using for a set to be countable: A set is $X$ is said to be finite provided that there exists a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}_n\to X$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . A set $X$ is said to be countably infinite provided that there exists a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\to X$ . A set is said to be countable provided that it is either finite or countably infinite. I have already shown that any subset of a finite set is finite using strong induction. Claim: Let $X$ be a countably infinite set. Then every set $Y$ such that $Y\subseteq X$ is countable. So I have broken down the question into quantifiers like so. Let $\leftrightarrow$ denote a bijection. $$\forall X|\exists f|\,f:\mathbb{N}\leftrightarrow X \Longrightarrow \forall Y|Y\subseteq X\,\exists h,g\exists n\in\mathbb{N}|\big((h:\mathbb{N}_n\leftrightarrow Y)\vee (g:\mathbb{N}\leftrightarrow Y)\big)$$ I have had a lot of trouble trying to prove this claim, and I think that breaking it down into quantifiers is even worse however, I got the thought to proceed by contradiction because I cannot see how to prove this directly.  I begin by supposing $X$ is a countably infinite set. Then there exists a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\leftrightarrow X$ . Suppose $Y\subseteq X$ . If $Y=X$ we are done. Now, suppose that every function $h:\mathbb{N}_n\to Y$ and $g:\mathbb{N}\to Y$ is not bijective. This is as far as I got with this line of thought. I wanted to show that if a function $f:A\to B$ is bijective, then the function $f':A'\to f(A')$ is also bijective, where $A'\subseteq A$ and $f(A')$ is the image of $f$ restricted to $A'$ . I was wondering if that even made sense as well. Then, I would immediately reach a contradiction if everything I have is correct. I don't necessarily want an answer, but I really do want a nudge in the right direction or some other hints for writing this proof. Edit: I cannot use any notions of cardinality or sequences.","['elementary-set-theory', 'proof-writing', 'functions']"
3845909,A doubt regarding change of variables in Double Integrals.,"So I have recently learnt to calculate ""Double Integrals"" and I have a doubt on change of variables. Lets say we are evaluating a double integral of the form I = $\int\int _R F(x,y) dx dy $ , where $F(x,y)$ is an integrable smooth function and $R$ is the region of integration in the $xy$ plane. Now I want to convert to polar co-ordinates $x(r,\theta)=r \cos(\theta)$ and $y(r,\theta) = r \sin(\theta)$ . Now the region $R$ in the $xy$ palne can be suitably converted to some region $R'$ in the $r \theta$ plane. The function $F(x,y)$ may take the form of some smooth and integrable $G(r,\theta)$ . My main doubt is with the change of the area element. According to my textbook, $dx dy = \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial(r,\theta)} = rdrd\theta$ . So the area element in the $r\theta$ plane is $rdr d\theta$ . Now I want to experiment a little bit with my understanding : I write $dx = d(r\cos\theta) = -r\sin\theta d\theta + \cos \theta dr$ and $dy = d(r\sin\theta)=r\cos\theta d\theta + \sin\theta dr $ . And now I multiply the two expression for $dx$ and $dy$ : $dxdy= -r^2\sin\theta\cos\theta d\theta d\theta - r \sin^2 \theta drd\theta + r \cos^2 \theta dr d\theta + \sin \theta \cos\theta dr dr$ . Why isn't this expression equal to $rdrd\theta$ ? The $d\theta d\theta$ and $dr dr$ terms look very odd to me. Am I commiting some abuse of notation or something ? Also there are no higher order terms like $dr dr d\theta$ which I can ignore. I am totally confused with all this. Can someone explain this to me a bit clearly? Thanks in Advance :). EDIT 1 : I know differentials are not the ""usual"" kind of algebraic quantities and we can't just add and multiply them casually. I am just multiplying $dx$ with $dy$ with the spirit of multiplying some $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ and letting both $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ tend to zero. EDIT 2 : Is there a branch of Mathematics where addition and multiplication of differentials is very common? Is there something like differential of a differential ?","['integration', 'area', 'multivariable-calculus', 'change-of-variable', 'intuition']"

I know two things: To apply the theorem , my equation has to be of the following form : $g'(x)=f(x,g)$ By setting $y'(x)=g(x)$ I can turn this into a first order system : $$y'(x)=g(x)\\g'(x)+x^2g(x)+xy=0$$ Now I can write the new equation like this: $$g'(x)=-x^2g(x)-xy\ \implies g'(x)=f(x,g,y)$$ Because of the ' $y$ ' term , this is not the form I'm looking for. Or is it? I know that $y$ is a function of $x$ , so is it correct to write the following? $$g'(x)=f(x,g,y(x))=f(x,g)$$ Normally I would go on and prove that f is continuous and Lipschitz in $x,g$ . What do I do in this case ? Do I have to show that f is continuous and Lipschitz in $y$ as well?","['initial-value-problems', 'lipschitz-functions', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

The video shows step by step solution. However, I think the question can be solved much easier as the following: We substitute $x=n-7$ and $n=a^{x}$ to obtain $a^{x}=x+7$ . Then quite obviously we find that for $x\geq4$ we have $a<2$ and we only need to evaluate $x=1,2,3$ . Then we find that the only pairs $(a,x)$ are $(8,1)$ and $(3,2)$ i.e. the only solutions are $n=8,9$ .

3846831,"""tessellation"" of set of points in 2D with convex polygons","I have a set of points in 2D, that I want to 'triangulate' with the lowest number of convex polygons. Is there an algorithm to do this? (like Delaunay triangulation , but with polygons) Remarks: I have seen many approaches to optimal splitting up of a given set of points into triangles (in 2-D; or simplices in n-D), but none for larger polygons. I have also seen many approaches to tessellating the plane with polygons of equal shape and without regarding any previously defined points. Voronoi tesselations are always convex; I was wondering if there is a way to find a second set of points, so, that the original set of points forms the vertices of voronoi cells of the first. In that case the voronoi tesselation would be the sought tessellation. I can't quite see it yet. If someone can point me in the right direction, that would be appreciated. edit 1 Starting from a Delaunay triangulation, I identified all edges that could be removed in a first step. There are some which are obvious, as they are inside a 4-polygon of which all edges cannot be removed - such as the one indicated by the red arrow. Any final solution will have this edge removed. However, there are many 'removable' edges that can only be removed if some other removable edge is not removed, and vice versa. Therefor, I need some criterion to select which to keep and which to remove. I was wondering about using circumscribed circles, like some Delaunay algorithms use, but haven't tried it yet. The idea would be to calculate the circumscribed circle for each polygon that results from the removal of a 'candidate' edge - and picking the one that only includes its own points in the resulting polygon. It's not immediately obvious to me, though, if this is necessarily leading to the optimal solution. (It's not even clear to me that the Delaunay triangulation is always a starting point with a path to that solution.) I'm gonna have to give it some more thought. edit 2 I've gone and implemented an algorithm that's a bit shaky but good enough for my purposes; I've added it as an answer. Someone more mathematically gifted is surely able to find a better solution; if so, please do comment / add your own answer.","['triangulation', 'geometry', 'tessellations']"

Define another set $S_{2}= [{1a,2a,3a,4a,\ldots,(p^2-1)a}]$ Since they hinted to mimic FLT proof, Im thinking that I prove that the sets are equal.

I also have no idea about the totient function and how that's relevant. I think once I find out how to say $S_{1} = S_{2}$ I can say, like how we do for FLT, that their products are equal.

Then I want to use the Monotone convergent theorem, i.e. to show $\{a_n\}$ is monotonic and bounded. For monotonic, it is easy to see that $\{a_n\}$ is increasing.

GENIVI-LEARNER has pointed out that my example doesn't fit either definition, because chances of a men being selected decrease after a men is selected. This is true only if sampling is seen as a repeated selection of one individual, and we require that all these events obey the same probability model. But if this is true, then sampling without replacement can never be random. That is, if I take out the selected item from the population after its selection, I won't have random sampling.

If $y^2+x^2+1$ is irreducible in $F[y]$ , then $F[y]/(y^2+x^2+1)$ is a field, so $(h(x))$ is a maximal ideal of $B$ , so $I=(h(x))$ is principal. Otherwise, $y^2+x^2+1$ is reducible in $F[y]$ , so $y^2+x^2+1=(y-k(x))(y+k(x)) \in F[y]$ . This is equivalent to $h(x)\mid 1+x^2+k(x)^2\in \Bbb Q[x]$ . Claim (hard): If $h(x)\mid 1+x^2+k(x)^2 \in \Bbb Q[x]$ , then $h(x)=f(x)^2+(1+x^2)g(x)^2$ for some $f,g\in\Bbb Q[x]$ . $(f(x)+yg(x))(f(x)-yg(x)) = h(x)\in I\subset B$ , $I$ being prime implies WLOG $f-yg\in I$ . $B/(f-yg)\cong F[y]/(f-yg,y^2+x^2+q)\cong F$ , so $(f-yg)$ is a maximal ideal, so $I=(f-yg)$ is principal. But I was not sure about the step 8. If we replace $\Bbb Q$ by $\Bbb R$ , then the problem become easier because the only field extension of $\Bbb R$ is $\Bbb C$ . But for $\Bbb Q$ , it is much harder.","['algebraic-geometry', 'abstract-algebra', 'principal-ideal-domains', 'commutative-algebra']"
3847669,Proving the surjectivity of a function,"Proving the injectivity of a function starts with lines similar to the following: Assume that $f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2})$ . If $x_{1} = x_{2}$ , then $f$ is an injection. Checking for the surjectivity of a function requires solving for the inverse and so on. Is there a similar way to prove the surjectivity of a function using a process similar to the one above?","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

Determine the probability of drawing an eight and then heart My work: their are $4$ eights and $13$ hearts So the deck is out of $52$ cards, so you multiply $4/52\times13/52= 1/52$ .

3847784,"Continuity in $\mathcal{C}([0,1])$ under $L^2$ norm","I need to prove (or show a counterexample) that the following function: $$ \begin{array}{rcl}
F: \mathcal{C}([0,1]) & \rightarrow & \mathbb{R} \\
x & \mapsto & \int_0^1 x(t)\ dt
\end{array}$$ is continuous relative to the $L^2$ norm on $\mathcal{C}([0,1])$ , which is: $$\lVert x \rVert_2=\sqrt{\int_0^1|x(t)|^2 \ dt}$$ In case it is continuous, I know it would suffice to show that the $L^2 $ norm somehow bounds the $L^1$ norm from above, since: $$\bigg|\int_0^1 x(t) \ dt -\int_0^1 \overline{x}(t) \ dx \bigg|\leq\int_0^1|x(t)-\overline{x}(t)| \ dt = \lVert x-\overline{x}\rVert_1$$ Otherwise, I would have to find an example of a sequence of functions $(x_n)_n$ that converges to some point $\overline{x}$ such that $\int_0^1 x_n(t) \ dt$ does not converge to $\int_0^1 \overline{x}(t) \ dt$ .

3847845,"Definition of separable stochastic process. Which is the ""intuition"" behind such a definition?","Herebelow, I quote Kuo (2006) Definition : A stochastic process $X(t,\omega)$ , $0\leq t\leq 1$ , $\omega\in\Omega$ is called separable if there exist $\Omega_0$ with $P(\Omega_0)=1$ and a countable dense subset $S$ of $[0,1]$ such that for any closed set $F\subset\mathbb{R}$ and any open interval $I\subset [0,1]$ , the set difference $$\bigg\{\omega\in\Omega; X(t,\omega)\in\ F, \forall \text{ } t\in I\cap S\bigg\}\backslash\bigg\{\omega\in\Omega; X(t,\omega)\in F,\forall \text{ }t\in I\bigg\}$$ is a subset of the complement $\Omega_0^c$ of $\Omega_0$ . The set $S$ is called a separating set. First, isn't $\Omega_0^c=\emptyset$ ? Secondly, what does the fact that $S$ is a subset of the complement $\Omega_0^c$ of $\Omega_0$ mean? What does $S$ ""separate""? From what? More generally, could you please explain the intuition behind such a definition, even in very rough terms?

3847850,What is the surface area of a plane on a sphere like Earth?,"If I have a $1 \text{km} $ x $1 \text{km} $ plain of grass, then the surface area is $1 \text{km}{^2} $ . Well, no, because the Earth isn't a flat plane but rather a sphere that's curved. The surface area will be a tiny bit bigger but by just how much exactly? Is there a formula to find the surface area of a portion of a sphere's surface? PS: I already know the Earth is oblate. For the purpose of this question just assume it's a perfect sphere of radius $6371 \text{km}$ with no imperfections (mountains, valleys, etc).","['area', 'surfaces', 'differential-geometry']"
3847942,Let $G$ be a group of order $24$ having no normal subgroups of order $3$. Show that $G$ has four subgroups of order $6$.,"Question Let $G$ be a group of order $24$ having no normal subgroups of order $3$ . Show that $G$ has four subgroups of order $6$ . Attempt It is $24=3\cdot 2^3$ and $n_3\mid 2^3,\ n_3\equiv 1\pmod{3}\Rightarrow n_3=1,4$ , $n_3\not=1$ from the hypothesis. Hence $n_3=4$ . It is $n_2\mid 3$ and $n_2\equiv 1\pmod{2}\Rightarrow n_2=1,3$ . If $n_2=1$ then there is a unique normal Sylow $2$ -subgroup $P_2$ [ and by taking the product with the $4$ Sylow $3$ -subgroups we have the four subgroups of order $6$ needed. ] {that's wrong} Problem : If $n_2=3$ how could I proceed?
