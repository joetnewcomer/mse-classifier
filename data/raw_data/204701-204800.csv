4059027,"""3 faces coin"" with biased interpretation","Say we have a ""3 faces coin"" that will be flipped infinitely many times. Face one is Heads (H) that comes up with probability $(1-m) p$ , Face two is Tails (T) that comes up with probability $(1-m)(1-p)$ , and Face three is Empty (E) that comes up with probability $m$ . Both $m$ and $p$ are between 0 and 1. Say the coin flipper never misreads H and T. However, whenever they face E, they will interpret it, with probability $g \geq 0.5$ , as evidence in favor of the face that came up more often until that point. (i.e. it will randomly transform the observed E into H or T, depending on the observed relative frequency of T and H). Particular example: if, at any point in time, the agent has observed 5 realizations in favor of H and 3 in favor of T, then if they face E, they will interpret as H with probability $g$ or as T with probability $1-g$ . Once the interpretation is stored, it will also influence the way the future E realizations will be interpreted. QUESTION IS: what is the probability that the number of H realizations/interpretations is greater than (less than) the number of number of T realizations/interpretations after infinitely many flips? (i.e., I am looking for an analytical/closed-form solution for such probability and that does depend on the parameters $m,p,g$ . Obs. 1: For simplicity, if the number of H's and T's are the same, one could use a tie break that favors H. I conjecture this is not wlog, but it makes things easier. Obs. 2: This problem seems to be similar to the Gambler's ruin, Polya's urn or some other branching process. But I haven't been able to solve it properly (not a mathematician here). thx!","['asymptotics', 'branching-rules', 'combinatorics', 'martingales', 'probability']"

Correct me if I'm wrong, an open set is a set that doesn't contain all its limits. From graphing $y = 1/x^2$ I can see that the curves converge towards the $x$ - and $y$ -axis but never touch the axes. Therefore, the set $D$ is an open set. Thats my intuition but I don't know how to formally prove it.","['multivariable-calculus', 'metric-spaces']"
4059082,Understanding the Basic Mathematics of a Kalman Filter,"In Introduction to Linear Algebra, Gilbert Strang, it says that for a Kalman filter $$
\hat{x}_1=\hat{x}_0+K_1(b_1-A_1\hat{x}_0)
$$ where the Kalman gain matrix $K_1=W_1A_1^TV_1^{-1}$ and covariance of errors in $\hat{x}_1$ is $W_1^{-1}=W_0^{-1}+A_1^{T}V_1^{-1}A_1$ . I think I understand what Kalman filter is trying to do, when new data is coming instead of computing the least square solution for the whole data we are trying to make use of the least square solution for old data to find that for the whole data. And I think here we are assuming the data error has a normal distribution and that is why the covariance matrix comes into picture. I also understand weighted least square solution for $Ax=b$ is $\hat{x}=(A^TV^{-1}A)^{-1}A^TV^{-1}b$ , and how we arrive at this expression. But how do we arrive at the term $K_1(b_1-A_1\hat{x}_0)$ ? I am having difficulty following the mathematical form of the equation as it is ?

Nonlinear heat flow has a wikipedia page but I don't understand how this differs from the traditional heat flow on Euclidean space. My guess is to replace the Laplacian with its version on a Riemannian manifold. This might also be related, but I recently learned that heat flow is locally a mean curvature flow. I'm not sure what the relationship between MCF and Ricci flow is, but this seems like a piece of the puzzle.","['heat-equation', 'ricci-flow', 'riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

In other words, I want a mirror reflection of one or two pieces. If this riddle has no solution, I would like to find proof. Let me remind original solution: Mind that the blue and green elements in the picture above do not have the same shape. So it is not possible to flip them both to the other side: Dudeney’s solutions to haberdasher's problem exact measures of sections Original riddle of Henry Dudeney: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27635/27635-h/27635-h.htm#p26 Here is a solution for 5 elements, which of course does not satisfy me. https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/q/79981/53127 Reason why I seek this solution The two pictures below may give you a context as to why I posted this question. I am a carpenter, I design and create dinosaur wooden puzzles. This one is based on Henry Dudney's dissection pattern. Assembling the triangle is already deity level difficulty. Unless familiar with Dudney's dissection, the wood grains lead you astray to square. However, the necessity of flipping any piece to the other side is what makes puzzles difficult even for a deity. Here is a video showing an example of dinosaur flip . Even my friends who know that I use a flip to obscure the puzzle, they cannot see that two shapes are complementary, if one is flipped.

4059210,Proving Jensen's inequality for the general case starting from the finite case,"For a finite convex combination, Jensen’s inequality is given by: $$f\left(\sum_i^n a_i x_i\right) \leq \sum_i^n a_i f(x_i)$$ for a convex $f$ . Proving this is not so bad starting from the definition of a convex function (iteratively break the convex combination into a convex combination between just two points and apply the definition of a convex function). For the case of general probability measures: $$f(\mathbb E X) \leq \mathbb E f(X)$$ where $X$ is a real valued random variable, the approach I know is pretty different (show that a tight affine lower bound of $f$ exists then apply linearity of expectation) but I feel that the method for the finite case could be made to work here. Here is my attempt , drawing inspiration from the construction of the Lebesgue integral: Given a real valued random variable $X$ , let $X^+,X^-$ be such that $X = X^+ - X^-$ so that it suffices to show the claim for non-negative random variables (apply the definition of convexity to the convex combination $\mathbb P [X>0] X^+ + \left(1-\mathbb P[X>0]\right) X^-$ ). Let $X_j$ be a sequence of simple random variables (defined as a finite sum of indicator functions on the sample space) dominated by $X$ such that $$\mathbb E X_j \rightarrow \sup \left\{\mathbb E Y: Y \leq X,\, Y\text{ is simple}\right\}$$ Now we have: $$f\left(\mathbb E X\right) = f\left(\mathbb E X_j + o(1)\right) = f\left(\mathbb E X_n\right) + o(1) \leq \mathbb E f\left( X_j\right) + o(1)$$ Where the first equality is by definition of the sequence $X_j$ , the second equality is from the fact that $f$ is convex and so continuous on the interior of its domain, the inequality is from the finite case of Jensen's inequality. Next, I would like to claim that $X_j \rightarrow ^p X$ and apply the continuous mapping theorem to complete the argument, but I'm not sure how to justify that claim. I could use feedback on my reasoning as well as some help justifying the last claim. EDIT: there is a simpler argument. Instead of defining $X_j$ as I have, I could instead define it as a sequence of simple random variables increasing towards $X$ pointwise (for every event in the sample space). I had not realize that we could define such a sequence in general, I am not sure how to show that this is true. In that case we have: $$\mathbb E f\left( X_j\right) = \mathbb E f\left( X\right) + o(1)$$ by the continuous mapping theorem. Any feedback on this followup approach would be very appreciated.","['measure-theory', 'jensen-inequality', 'lebesgue-integral', 'solution-verification', 'probability']"
4059250,Topology of a set of matrices,"I am trying to find the topology of $M$ where $$M := \left\{ A \in \Bbb R^{3 \times 3} \mid A = 2 \vec{u} \cdot (\vec{u})^T - (\mathbb{1}_{3 \times 3} - \vec{u} \cdot (\vec{u})^T) \right\},$$ with $\vec{u}$ three dimensional unit vectors with real coefficients and $\mathbb{1}_{3 \times 3}$ the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix.

4059267,Why we don't use the universal quantifier in the usual definition of the cartesian product?,"I see everywhere that the usual definition of a cartesian product between two set is : $$\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B} = \{(a,b): a \in \mathrm{A}, b \in \mathrm{B} \}$$ I wondered why we don't add a universal quantifier like so : $$\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B} = \{(a,b): \forall a \in \mathrm{A}, \forall b \in \mathrm{B} \}$$ Asking myself this question led me to the following reflection : I know that a set-builder notation is of the form : $$   \{x: \Phi (x)\}$$ where : $\Phi (x)$ is a logical predicate such that all values of x for which the predicate holds belongs to the set being defined I do think $x$ is what we call ""an unbound variable"" in logic Hence $\{x: \Phi (x)\}$ can be interpreted as ""all mathematical objects for which the predicate holds belongs to the set being defined"" Therefore, the notation : $$\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B} = \{(a,b): a \in \mathrm{A}, b \in \mathrm{B} \}$$ can be interpreted as : ""all ordered pair for which it's first element is in $\mathrm{A}$ and it's second is in $\mathrm{B}$ belongs to the cartesian product of those sets (which is a set)"". So in the notation where I add the universal quantifier, I made a grammatical mistake, because ""for all"" is not to be added with the usage of a free variable), my question was why (when I didn't know the existence of ""unbound variable"") we don't have to put a universal quantifier this way : $$\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B} = \{\forall(a,b): a \in \mathrm{A}, b \in \mathrm{B} \}$$ After all, a quantifier ("" $\exists$ "") is used in the correct definition, so why can't we use an other?
I'm pretty sure it is related to bond and free variables : if one choose the last definition I wrote, one makes the variable $(a,b)$ bounded, if one choose the usual definition, one use a free variable, therefore if the last definition I wrote is wrong, it might be because we can't use bounded variable in the set builder notation (outside the predicate), isn't it? If it the case, why? Does the formula "" $\mathrm{A} \times \mathrm{B} = \{(a,b): a \in \mathrm{A}, b \in \mathrm{B} \}$ "" belongs to first-order logic or Higher-order logic (I'm a beginner in formal logic)?

Part b is the one we are unsure about. We have set up the problem using a couple of variables and applied various differentiation techniques. The answers we are getting, however, are varied and even our teacher has said that he needs a bit more time to work out which one is correct! I am quite eager to find out whether my technique is correct. The different answers we have got are: $2.6 \times 10^{-3}$ radians/second (then we can convert this to degrees per second as the question asks) $2.6$ degrees/second I appreciate that by putting this question out there, I may generate different responses, so I will wait to see if a several people start getting the same answer before accepting if it is correct.

We also have the number of $\{\in\}$ - formulas is countable so it would seem that $L_{\omega+1}$ must also be countable. Is this correct?

4059432,Philosophically motivated risk metrics,"During a random process over a sample space $\Omega$ , an agent incurs a cost (say, in money) given by a random variable $Z:\Omega \rightarrow R$ , which is determined by the agent's action. The agent chooses the action which minimizes its ""risk"", which it calculates as some function $\rho(Z)$ . Examples: A risk-neutral agent uses $\rho=E$ , the expectation operator, to minimize expected cost. A minimax agent uses $\rho(Z)=\inf_\omega Z(\omega)$ to minimize the maximum possible cost. A maxipok agent uses $\rho(Z)=P(Z > z)$ to minimize the chance of a cost exceeding a threshold $z$ . The latter two agents are risk-averse : given two cost distributions with the same mean, they will associate more risk with whichever has higher variance. Risk-aversion is often quite sensible: would you rather certainly keep your house, or bet it against a second house on a fair coinflip? But expected utility theorists typically justify risk-aversion on the basis that an agent's true utility function is usually concave in their net worth--money has decreasing marginal utility . Equivalently, cost in utility is convex in monetary cost. If this is the rationale for risk-aversion, then a risk-averse agent's risk metric should satisfy $\rho(Z)=E(f \circ Z)$ , where $f:R \rightarrow R$ is a convex function that relates cost in money to cost in utility. It's not hard to show that the maxipok metric satisfies this relationship for $f(c) = I(c > z)$ , but minimax does not for any $f$ . Nor do many of the other most popular risk metrics in finance: none of the VaR $_\alpha$ , CVaR $_\alpha$ , and mean-variance metrics can be interpreted as minimizing the expectation of a latent disutility function. The only well-studied risk-averse metric besides maxipok with this property is entropic risk, which has $f(c) = e^{-ac}$ . Ok, here's the question: I'm curious whether there is a pleasant characterization of the set of risk metrics which compute the expectation of some disutility. In other words, when does $\rho:R^\Omega \rightarrow R \cup \{\pm\infty\}$ satisfy $\rho(Z) = E(f \circ Z)$ for some $f:R \rightarrow R$ ? Furthermore, if $f$ exists, when does it have nice properties, e.g. monotonicity, continuity, convexity? The $|\Omega| < \infty$ case is probably the place to start, to make the measure theory less horrifying.","['risk-assessment', 'utility', 'probability-theory']"

4059501,"Is there a way to prove this sequence converges uniformly on $x\in [0,1]$ (related to an integral)","I want to learn if there's a way to determine if the following sequence converges uniformly on $x\in [0,1]$ $$a_{n+1}(x)=e^{-xa_{n}(x)},\quad a_{0}(x)=1$$ By mathematical induction, I can show that if $0\leq a_{1}(x)\leq 1$ when $0\leq x\leq 1$ , then $$0\leq a_{n+1}(x)\leq 1$$ holds $\forall\, n\in\mathbb{N}$ on that interval.

(I really don't know what I'm doing when it comes to convergence so I apologize if my work isn't anywhere close). If context helps at all, the reason why I'm asking is because I wanted to evaluate the following integral: $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{1}a_{n}(x)\mathrm dx \stackrel{?}{=}\frac{1}{2}\Omega^{2}+\Omega$$ whereby $a_{n}(x)$ is the aformentioned sequence, and $\Omega$ represents the Omega constant . Numerical approximations hint that the solution is fairly close (possibly correct) but I can't be certain. Consider expanding the domain of integration beyond $[0,1]$ ... $$\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{q\ln q}a_{n}(x)\mathrm dx \stackrel{?}{=}\frac{1}{2}\ln^{2}q\, + \ln q,\quad q\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq 2}$$ Numerical approximations are still close, but further off...perhaps because my skills at numerical approximations are bad, or because $a_{n}(x)$ doesn't converge uniformly on larger domains. It seems like for $$g(q) = \Bigg|\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{q\ln q}a_{n}(x)\mathrm dx - \Bigg(\frac{1}{2}\ln^{2}q\, + \ln q\Bigg)\Bigg|$$ that $g(q)$ cycles and the magnitude gets increasingly larger as $q\to\infty$ . Is there a way to determine a cut-off in the domain $[0,\infty)$ where the sequence $a_{n}(x)$ doesn't converge anymore?

4059557,Relationships between $2$ mutually tangent circles in a semi-circle,"In the attempt to answer this question , I was brought to another one, connected to a certain family of circles. Consider the semicircle made of the upper half of the unit circle and the horizontal diameter with endpoints $A(-1,0)$ and $B(1,0)$ . Let us now consider the family $(F)$ of circles inscribed into this semicircle as can be seen on Fig. 1. Fig. 1: Certain circles of family $(F).$ They can be described in a parametric way as circles $$\text{with center} \ (x_c=-\cos a, y_c=\frac12 \sin^2a) \ \text{and radius} \ y_c, \ a \in (0,\pi) \tag{1}$$ or equivalently as circles $(C_T)$ $$\text{with center} \ \left(x_c=\frac{T^2-1}{(1+T)^2}, y_c=\frac{2T}{(1+T)^2}\right) \ \text{and radius} \ y_c, \ T \in (0,+\infty) \tag{2}$$ (Connection between the two parameterizations: $T=t^2$ where $t:=\tan \tfrac{a}{2}$ ). The locus of these centers is parabola $(P)$ with cartesian equation: $$y=\tfrac12(1-x^2),\tag{3}$$ represented on Fig. 2 as the light blue curve. Each circle $(C_T) \in F$ is associated with a unique circle $(C_{T'}) \in F$ which is tangent to $(C)$ as depicted on Fig. 2. Fig. 2: Two circles of family $(F)$ are mutually tangent if their parameters $T$ and $T'$ comply with relationship (4). Let $I$ be the point of tangency of $(C_T)$ and $(C_{T'})$ . Question: how can we describe the locus of $I$ ? (sketched as the magenta curve on Fig. 2.) My work: I have obtained through tedious calculations an unexpected linear relationship between parameters $T$ and $T'$ which is: $$T=(3-2 \sqrt{2})T'\tag{4}$$ Using (4), I have tried to obtain the locus of $I$ as the envelope of chords defined by the line segment joining the centers of circles $C_T,C_{T'}$ using homographies but to no avail. Edit: Nice solution using inversion (a little different from the solution given in a comment by Blue). 'Refer to Fig. 3). Consider inversion with pole $S(0,-1)$ and power $2$ meaning that $M$ is exchanged with $M'$ iff $S,M,M'$ are aligned and $SM.SM'=2$ . Its circle of inversion is  the black circle (center $S$ , radius $\sqrt{2}$ ). It is easy to see that any circle of family (F) is globally invariant. This is in particular the case for the two blue circles. As the image by inversion of two tangent curves in a certain point $I$ is two tangent curves with contact point $I'$ where $M'$ is the image of $M$ , point $I$ is invariant, establishing that $I$ belongs to the circle of inversion. $\square$ As a consequence, tangency points $T_1$ and $U_1$ , $T_2$ and $U_2$ , are exchanged, meaning that $S,T_1,U_1$ and $S,T_2,U_2$ are aligned.

I would like to estimate their number. Problem: It's not possible for me to count them individually, and i cannot dry the aquarium due to the fact that the newborns are translucid and have sizes bellow 4 milimeters, it would be an impossible task to distinguish them from the grains of smalls rocks in my aquarium. Pre-Condition: Due to the fact that newborns stay relatively close to the ground and as they grow they will occupy (swim) in places increasingly closer to the surface level, we can consider that the fishes are uniformly distributed in the aquarium. Fish Tank Possible method: Take a cup of water (for example 150 milliliters) consistently from the same place of the aquarium, and count the number of fishes from inside the cup. By repeating this method multiple time i could in theory estimate the total number of fishes in my aquarium. Question: Is this a good method? Are there any big flaws in my lines of thinking?

I have been trying to show the existence of an identity in $S$ on $*$ as I think the rest will follow, but I cannot seem to make any progress. My work so far is not very solid, but it is an attempt to show that there is at least one $e$ exists such that $$a ∗ e = e ∗ a = b, \text{ where }a,b\in S$$ Reasoning as follows: From the problem statement: $$∀ (a, b) ∈ S × S\ ∃ (c, d) ∈ S × S:\ a*c = d*a = b$$ I would like to show that at least one such $(a, b)$ has $c = d$ . I try a proof by contradiction: Assume $$∀ (a, b) ∈ S × S\ \exists (c, d) ∈ S × S\ c ≠ d:\ a*c = d*a = b$$ Since $S$ is finite, so let $|S| = n$ . $$\therefore|S × S| = n^2$$ But there are $n(n-1)$ pairs of the form $(c, d) ∈ S × S$ such that $c ≠ d$ . From here I am trying to use the pigeonhole principle to show that there exists $(a,x)$ and $(b,y)$ such that $$(a = b\text{ and }x ≠ y)\text{ or }(x = y\text{ and }a ≠ b)$$ that satisfy $$a*c = c*a = x$$ $$b*c = c*b = y$$ leading to an obvious contradiction. I think there is a way to derive this existence, since intuitively there are $n$ ""excess"" pairs after relating pairs $(a, b)$ one-to-one with pairs $(c, d)$ . I would greatly appreciate a hint.

Given $\epsilon > 0$ , consider the set of points $\{x \in \mathbf{R}, t(x)\ge \epsilon\}$ . Argue that all the points in this set are isolated. Proof. Consider $x_n:= \frac{n}{n+1}$ .

(x_n) = \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4},\frac{4}{5},\ldots

\partial_xf(x,y)+\partial_yg(x,y) &= 0,\\
\partial_xg(x,y)-\partial_yf(x,y) &= 0,
\end{cases}$$ for the functions $f$ and $g$ . Here's what I saw so far: by deriving each line by $x$ or $y$ and substituing in the other equations, we can see that de system becomes $$\begin{cases}
(\partial^2_x+\partial^2_y)f(x,y) &= 0,\\
(\partial^2_x+\partial^2_y)g(x,y) &= 0,

But, if I'm not mistaken, this manipulation results in finding a particular case form of solutions, i.e. a subset of solutions in the bigger set of solutions that the initial system admits. Is that right ? these equations are the Cauchy-Riemann equations, thus this system is exactly equivalent to asking that the complexe map $$F(x+iy)=g(x,y)+if(x,y)$$ is holomorphic (or $\mathbb{C}$ -differentiable) but, up to my knowledge, there exist no generic explicit expression for such maps. Does this means that this system of PDEs is just a constraint on the form of $f$ and $g$ but that there is no generic explicit solution ? In general, how to solve this system ?

Proof that: a) $\quad$ $\alpha$ is a straight line if and only if the curvature vanishes. b) $\quad$ If $\dot{\alpha}$ and $\ddot{\alpha}$ are linearly dependent, then $\alpha$ is a straight line. Conisder a) . At first this problem seemed easy to me. Because if the curvature is defined via $$\ddot{\alpha}(t) = \kappa(t) \cdot n(t) \qquad \qquad (1)$$ where $n(t)$ is the unit vector perpendicular to the tangent vector, then it is easy to see that $\kappa = 0$ implies $\ddot{\alpha} = 0$ and therefore $\alpha$ is a straight line. However, I realsied, that the above equation is derived by using the fact $$\big< \dot{\alpha} , \dot{\alpha} \big> = 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \big< \dot{\alpha}, \ddot{\alpha} \big> = 0$$ in the case of $\alpha$ being parameterised by arc length. Since my given $\alpha$ is not parameterised by arc length, I cannot assume equation (1) to hold and therefore cannot assume my $\ddot{\alpha}$ to be perpendicular to the tangent vector. My conclusion would be wrong then. Any ideas on how to solve this problem for general curves $\alpha$ ? b) I have no idea on how to show this.

I'd like to ask if my conclusions pertaining to exercise (a), (b) of the below problem are correct. Notation. $f(x)= [[x]]$ is the box function, the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$ , for all $x \in \mathbf{R}$ . Exercise 4.2.4. Consider the reasonable but erroneous claim that \begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 10} \frac{1}{[[x]]} = \frac{1}{10}
\end{align*} (a) Find the largest $\delta$ that represents a proper response to the challenge of $\epsilon = 1/2$ . (b) Find the largest $\delta$ that represents a proper response to $\epsilon = 1/50$ . (c) Find the largest $\epsilon$ challenge for which there is no suitable $\delta$ response possible. Proof. (a) We require \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{2} &< \frac{1}{[[x]]} &< \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{-4}{10} &< \frac{1}{[[x]]} &< \frac{6}{10}
\end{align*} So, $[[x]] < \frac{-10}{4} < -2$ and $[[x]]>\frac{10}{6} > 1$ . In other words, $x-10 < -12$ and $x-10>-8$ . The absolute distance must satisfy the inequality $\absval{x - 10} < 8$ . Thus, the largest $\delta-$ response to the challenge $\epsilon=1/2$ appears to be $\delta = 8$ . (b) We require \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{50} &< \frac{1}{[[x]]} &< \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{50} \\
\frac{4}{50} &< \frac{1}{[[x]]} &< \frac{6}{50}
\end{align*} So, $[[x]] < \frac{50}{4} < 13$ and $[[x]]>\frac{50}{6} > 8$ . In other words, $x < 13$ or $x >9$ . The absolute distance must satisfy the inequality $\absval{x - 10} < 1$ . Thus, the largest $\delta-$ response to the challenge $\epsilon=1/50$ appears to be $\delta = 1$ . (c) We would like to have the distance \begin{align*}
\absval{\frac{1}{[[x]]} - \frac{1}{10}} > \epsilon
\end{align*} no matter what the open interval $(10-\delta,10+\delta)$ in which $x$ lies. Rearranging, I get: \begin{align*}
\epsilon < \frac{\absval{[[x]] - 10}}{10 \absval{[[x]]}}
\end{align*} I am not sure how to proceed from here. I know that, $\absval{[[x]] - 10}$ . That yields, \begin{align*}
\epsilon < \frac{\delta}{10 \absval{[[x]]}}
\end{align*} I can further write, $[[x]] > \lceil{10 - \delta}\rceil$ . But, this $\epsilon$ is dependent on the $\delta$ -interval I choose.","['limits', 'solution-verification', 'epsilon-delta', 'real-analysis']"

on a neighborhood containing $\mathcal{Q};$ a linear transformation $\rho:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\rho\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right)$ is an origin-centered interval congruent with $\mathcal{Q};$ a translation $\tau_{\mathbf{a}}\circ\rho\left(\mathcal{C}_{1}\right)=\mathcal{Q};$ and a composite mapping $S=T\circ\tau_{\mathbf{a}}\circ\rho.$ In addition, it is given that $$
\mathbf{y}=\tau_{\mathbf{a}}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\in\mathcal{Q}\implies\left\Vert dT_{\mathbf{a}}^{-1}\circ dT_{\mathbf{y}}-I\right\Vert \le\epsilon\in\left(0,1\right).
$$ So, by the chain rule and the linearity of $\rho$ we have $$
dS_{\mathbf{0}}^{-1}\circ dS_{\mathbf{x}}=\left(dT_{\mathbf{a}}\circ\rho\right)^{-1}\circ\left(dT_{\mathbf{y}}\circ\rho\right)=\rho^{-1}\circ dT_{\mathbf{a}}^{-1}\circ dT_{\mathbf{y}}\circ\rho.
$$ Therefore $$
\left\Vert dS_{\mathbf{0}}^{-1}\circ dS_{\mathbf{x}}-I\right\Vert \le\left\Vert \rho\right\Vert ^{-1}\left\Vert dT_{\mathbf{a}}^{-1}\circ dT_{\mathbf{y}}-I\right\Vert \left\Vert \rho\right\Vert .
$$ It's the last part that I'm not following. The part I do (believe I) understand is $$

4061068,How do I know if this limit even converges?,"So, there is this question which I found quite new according to my experience, and it is as follows. Assuming that interchange of limit and integration is permissible, evaluate the following: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} {\int_0^1 \frac{nx^{n -1}}{1 + x}dx}, \quad 0 < x < 1$$ Now, I first tried integration by parts, and it doesn't give me more than an expression which is also nearly impossible to evaluate (maybe I'm doing it wrong, though) - $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{1}{1+x}\int nx^{n - 1}dx  +  \int\frac{x^n}{(1 + x)^2}dx\right|_0^1$$ I'm not sure how to proceed from there, so I tried this instead: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} {\int_0^1 {nx^{n - 1}(1 + x)^{-1}}dx}$$ Expanding $(1 + x)^{-1}$ using Taylor Series: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} {\int_0^1 {nx^{n - 1}(1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 - x^5 \ldots)}dx}$$ $$ = \lim_{n \to \infty} {\int_0^1 {(nx^{n - 1} - nx^n + nx^{n + 1} - nx^{n + 2} + nx^{n + 3} - n^{x + 4} \ldots)}dx}$$ $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{n}{n+1} + \frac{n}{n+2} - \frac{n}{n +3} + \frac{n}{n +4} - \frac{n}{n + 5}\ldots\right)$$ I think that diverges. Then, I tried putting the expression in Desmos and increased the $n$ value slowly upto $500$ , $1000$ and similar big numbers - which all returned values around $0.5$ .

4061112,Validity of simple intuition for $\sum 1/p \sim \log \log n$ work?,"I want to show the following using the simplest arguments for students without university training in mathematics. $$\sum_{p<n} 1/p \sim \log \log n$$ I'd like to check the validity of my rationale. Step 1: We start with the Euler product formula which we derive elsewhere [ref] . $$\sum_{n}\frac{1}{n^{s}}=\prod_{p}(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})^{-1}$$ We take the logarithms of both sides. Step 2: On the RHS we have: $$\begin{align}
\ln\left(\prod_{p}\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})}\right) &= \sum_{p}\ln\frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})}\\
&=-\sum_{p}\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})\end{align}$$ We can use $\ln(1-x)=-x-\frac{x^{2}}{2}-\frac{x^{3}}{3}-\ldots$ to expand $\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^s})$ . $$\begin{align}
-\sum_{p}\ln(1-\frac{1}{p^{s}})&=\sum_{p}(\frac{1}{p^{s}}+\frac{1}{2p^{2s}}+\frac{1}{3p^{3s}}+\frac{1}{4p^{4s}}\ldots)\\&=\sum_{p}\frac{1}{p^{s}}+C
\end{align}$$ We know $C$ converges because we know $\sum1/n^s$ converges for $s>1$ , and the sum over primes $\sum 1/p^s$ is a subset of the sum over integers $\sum 1/n^s$ . Step 3: We start with the logarithm of the partial harmonic series. $$
\ln(\ln(n+1)) < \ln\left(\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{x}\right) < \ln(\ln(n)+1)
$$ The inequality is from the integral comparison tests for finite harmonic partial sums ( ref ). The lower and upper bounds are like $\ln(\ln(n))$ The sum $\ln\left(\sum_{1}^{n}\frac{1}{x}\right)$ is the LHS of the Euler product in the limit as $n\rightarrow \infty$ , and $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ for the Euler product. Step 4: This is the step I am not sure about. In this step we try to combine the results from step 2 and 3. We consider the limit $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ for the expression from step 2: $$\sum_{p}\frac{1}{p}+C$$ Similarly we consider the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ for the expression in step 3 and conclude that the logarithm of the harmonic series diverges but it does so as $\ln(\ln(n))$ . Therefore we can say the prime harmonic series diverges as $$\sum_{p<n} 1/p \sim \ln(\ln(n))$$ The key idea I think I'm using is to enable comparison of two expressions by taking the limits $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $s\rightarrow1^{+}$ to make them equivalent. Is there a flaw in this argument? I would appreciate explanations that didn't assume advanced knowledge.","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory', 'prime-numbers']"

When $m=2$ , $x_{n,2}=\frac{n^2(n+1)(n-1)}{12}$ , which is still an integer for any $n>m$ because one of $n,(n+1), (n-1)$ is divisible by $3$ , and two of them must be divisible by $2$ , since if $2|n$ , then $4|n^2$ , else if $2$ is not a factor of $n$ , then both $n+1$ and $n-1$ is divisible by $2$ . So the whole thing is divisible by $4$ also. When $m=3$ , the denominator becomes $144$ , I could also brutally prove that it's still an integer, but more importantly it seems to suggest that $x_{n,m}$ is always an integer, so I'm wondering if this could be rigorously proved by induction. Induction Process: The base case is already verified in the preceding section, so suppose $x_{n,m}\in\Bbb Z$ for $m=1,...,m-1$ , then for $p=1,...,m$ \begin{align}
x_{n+1,p}=\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{p}(n+1-j+1)(n+1-j+2)}{p!(p+1)!}\\

4061129,What is the expected number of flips you need to get k changeovers?,"Flip a fair coin several times. Say that a changeover occurs whenever an outcome differs from the one preceding it. For instance, if you flip the coin 5 times and the outcome is HHTHT, then there are 3 changeovers. Consider n independent flips of this coin, what is the expected number of changeovers? What is the expected number of flips you need to get k changeovers? My Attempt This one isn't too hard. Let $I_j$ be an indicator random variable that equals $1$ if we have a changeover and $0$ otherwise. For $I_j=1$ , we need to have a heads on the $j^{th}$ flip and tails on the $(j+1)^{th}$ flip or tails first then heads for $j\in[1,n-1]$ . Thus, $$\mathbb{P}(I_j=1)=2p(1-p)$$ Our coin is fair, so $p=\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus, $\mathbb{P}(I_j=1)=\frac{1}{2}$ If X is a random variable representing the number of changeovers. Then by linearity of the expectation, we have that $$\mathbb{E}(X)=\sum_j\mathbb{P}(I_j)=(n-1)\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{n-1}{2}$$ For this part, I am not so sure how to start. Would I use a binomial distribution? As in $X\sim\text{Bin}(n,\frac{1}{2})$ so that our probability is $$\mathbb{P}(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}(\frac{1}{2})^k(1-\frac{1}{2})^{n-k}$$ I'm not too sure that this is the right approach or how to continue. Edit Second attempt for the second part: (I know this is wrong from the comments below, but can I get pointers on where I went wrong?) Let X be the number of flips before k changeovers. Then $X\sim\text{Geom}(p)$ . The probability is given by the formula $$\mathbb{P}(X=k)=(1-p)^{k-1}p$$ We know that $p=\frac{1}{2}$ from the last part, so $\mathbb{P}(X=k)=\frac{1}{2^k}$ The expectation of a geometric distribution is $\mathbb{E}[X]=\frac{1}{p}$ , so we have $E[X]=2^k$","['expected-value', 'probability', 'random-variables']"

This looks really nice like you could sum it or something but it really just doesn't play nice when you try to.

4061470,Why does not noise accumulate in a stochastic differential equation as it would in a random walk?,"I had a question about stochastic differential equations. I come from statistics, so I am more familiar with say random walks, which are of course, discrete. So if I had a process like where $x(t)$ traces the random walk evolution of a variable over time, then that might look like this recursively: $$
x(t+1) = x(t) + \epsilon \sim Binomial(p,n)
$$ where $p,n$ are parameters for the chance of success and number of trials, respectively. If I ran this simulation multiple and plotted time $t$ versus $x(t)$ , I would get a fan or cone shaped plot with all trajectories starting at the same point, but then progressively spreading out with each time step. My question is, when I look at plots of stochastic differential equations, I don't see this same kind of fanning behavior. When talking about an SDE of the form: $$
du = f(u, p, t)dt + g(u, p, t)dW
$$ In this case, $f$ is the deterministic part of the process and $g$ is the noise process, usually Brownian motion. This is of course a continuous time equation. Here is a plot of a stochastic version of the lorenz equation that conforms to the SDE form above--taken from the Julia Differential Equations documentation . Again, my question is, why don't we see the trajectory fan out over time. It seems like the trajectory does wiggle, but it does not diffuse as in a random walk. I was just trying to understand what are the forces at play that prevent the noise process to overwhelm the deterministic part of the process over time?","['stochastic-processes', 'stochastic-differential-equations', 'ordinary-differential-equations']"

4061616,Binomial theorem from first principles?,"I suppose I'll give a little context to this... I was at first really excited by the prospect that both Bernoulli and Taylor's versions of $e^x$ actually ammount to the same thing (where, when you expand Bernoulli's definition $\lim_{n\to\infty}(1+\frac{x}{n})^n$ it simplifies to the Taylor series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}$ - unlike, say, trigonometric functions like $\sin(x)$ which look a bit more unsatisfying). However, upon further reflection, to say that one identity 'simplifies' to the other seems almost circular given it presupposes binomial theorem. So, I decided to do a little scouting online, and found that binomial theorem could be proven using proof by induction. But once again, I felt unsatisfied as it feels as though you've just divined up some formula which works. How did you come up with it in the first place? Well, that's when I thought of probability theory. We use a binomial expression $^nC_{r}$ when we are looking for the number of combinations we have for arranging things. We can very intuitively derive this formula, however, as I don't want this question to be unecessarily large, I'm not going to go into detail about this here. What counts, is that we can figure out this formula from first principles - we're not getting it from nowhere. As I'm sure you already know, $^nC_{r}$ is key to figuring out binomial distributions. Once again I'm not going to explaim this, but an example probability calculation becomes $^{10}C_{4}(\frac{1}{6})^4(\frac{1}{6})^{10-4}$ for rolling 4 sixes in 10 total rolls. According to (Kolmogorov's) axioms of probability, the probability of all total outcomes $P(\Omega)$ is 1. Let's consider the context of total binomial outcomes of 3 trials (I pick this number for simple and illustrative purposes), where we designate the probablity of success, $\frac{1}{5}$ , and that of failure, $\frac{4}{5}$ , (where the sum of all different outcomes, here success and failure = 1). Well, we know that becuase we have 3 trials, logically, we'll have 4 possibilities: 0 successes, 1 success, 2 successess, or 3 success; we can write out our probability as: $^{3}C_{0}(\frac{1}{5})^3(\frac{4}{5})^0$ + $^{3}C_{1}(\frac{1}{5})^2(\frac{4}{5})^1$ + $^{3}C_{2}(\frac{1}{5})^1(\frac{4}{5})^2$ + $^{3}C_{3}(\frac{1}{5})^0(\frac{4}{5})^3$ = $(\frac{1}{5})^3$ + $3(\frac{1}{5})^2(\frac{4}{5})$ + $3(\frac{1}{5})(\frac{4}{5})^2$ + $(\frac{4}{5})^3$ $= 1$ . This can of course be generalised to $\sum_{k=0}^{n}$$^{n}C_{k}{p}^k{q}^{n-k}$ where $n$ is the total number of trials $k$ the number of successes, $p$ the probability of success, $q$ that of failure. Now let's consider the binomial expansion of $(a + b)^3$ . Well, supposing we know nothing about binomial theory and do it by hand, our algebra nonetheless simplifies to $a^3 + 3a^2b + 3b^2a + b^3$ . Hmmm... this looks suspicously like our total probability forumla expanded above. It almost looks as though $a$ could be representing our successes, and $b$ our failures. So my reasoning is such: it just so happens that in the context of probability, the total probability of your outcomes add up to 1. If $\Omega = \left\{ a, b \right\}$ , then, by Kolmogorov's axioms, $a + b = 1$ . What we're effectively saying is that for any binomial expansion, we can treat them as 'probability outcomes' where $a + b \ne 1$ . Is this a reasonable proof?","['binomial-distribution', 'alternative-proof', 'binomial-theorem', 'probability-theory', 'probability']"

(full proof is here ) I understand the first step, which we just consider an arbitrary open interval $(a-\varepsilon, b+\varepsilon)$ and arrive at $m^*([a,b]) \leq b-a$ . From here, I agree that if we can show $m^*([a,b]) \geq b-a$ , then we have $m^*([a,b]) = b-a$ , which is what we want for closed bounded intervals. For the converse, I understand the application of Heine-Borel on an arbitrary open cover of $[a,b]$ and obtaining the subsequent sum of lengths of the intervals in a finite subcover. We get from these calculations that for any arbitrary finite subcover $\{I_k\}_{k=1}^N$ , we have $\sum_{k=1}^N l(I_k) > b-a$ . The connection I'm not making here is why $\sum_{k=1}^N l(I_k) > b-a$ implies $m^*([a,b]) \geq b-a = l([a,b])$ . The former is a statement about the sum of lengths over a finite subcover of $[a,b]$ , so it seems like if anything, I want to say that $m^*([a,b]) \leq b-a$ since $m^*(A) = \inf\{\sum_k l(I_k)|A\subseteq I_k\}$ . EDIT: for reference, Royden defines Lebesgue outer measure of a set $A$ of real numbers as $m^*(A) = \inf\{\sum_{k=1}^\infty l(I_k) | A \subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty I_k\}$ , where $l$ of an interval is defined to be the difference of its endpoints if the interval is bounded, and $\infty$ otherwise.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"

4061842,Asymptotic matching of a first order ODE,"Consider the following ODE: \begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}y(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \varepsilon y(1-y)+y^2-\varepsilon \frac{y^2}{1-y} \quad \quad \text{for} \quad \quad t>0, \tag{1}
\end{equation} where $y(0)=c$ and $\varepsilon\ll1.$ I would like to find an asymptotic solution that is valid for all $t>0.$ I have attached a figure of the numerical solution for $\varepsilon = 0.01$ and $c=0.5.$ For the outer solution (the solution that satisfies the initial conditions), I take $y(t) \sim y_0(t) +\varepsilon y_1(t)$ and substitute this into equation (1), which at leading order, gives \begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}y_0(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = y_0^2, \quad \quad \text{where} \quad \quad y_0(0)=c. \tag{2}
\end{equation} Solving yields \begin{equation}
y_0(t) = \frac{c}{1-ct}. \tag{3}
\end{equation} Im relatively comfortable that this is correct outer solution. Now, I need to find the inner solution which matches with this outer solution. Taking $y_{\infty}$ to be the steady state solution to (1), I make the variable transform \begin{equation}
\tau = \frac{t-t_0}{\varepsilon^{\alpha}} \quad \quad \text{which provides} \quad \quad \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}= \varepsilon^{-\alpha}\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\tau},\tag{4}
\end{equation} for $\alpha>0.$ Here $t_0$ is the overlap between the outer and inner solutions; this can be estimated by seeing when $y_0(t)$ first meets $y_{\infty}$ , meaning we just solve $y_0(t_0)=y_{\infty}.$ Doing so yields $t_0 = (y_{\infty}-c)/y_{\infty}c.$ For the inner region, the numerical simulations suggest that we take $Y(\tau) \sim y_{\infty}-\varepsilon Y_1(\tau). $ Substituting this into (1) yields \begin{equation}
-\varepsilon^{1-\alpha}\frac{\mathrm{d}Y_1}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = -2\varepsilon y_{\infty} Y_1+\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2). \tag{5}
\end{equation} This is where I'm stuck. There is no possible balance except from taking $\alpha = 0$ , which is not allowed. Furthermore, say if $\alpha=0$ , equation (5) solves to give $Y_1 = k \exp (2y_{\infty}\tau),$ which is clearly secular. Am I using the wrong variable transform? I'm clearly doing something wrong, since $Y_1\rightarrow \infty$ as $\tau \rightarrow \infty$ .

4061918,Normalization of an affine toric variety is toric,"In the book ""Toric Varieties"" by Cox-Little-Schenck, Proposition 1.3.8 is left as an exercise. It essentially characterizes what the normalization of an affine toric variety is. The construction is as follows: Pick $V=\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}])$ where $\mathsf{S}$ is an affine semigroup. Let $\mathscr{A} = \{m_1,\ldots,m_s\}\subseteq \mathsf{S}$ be such that $\mathbb{N}\mathscr{A} = \mathsf{S}$ , and let $M = \mathbb{Z}\mathscr{A}$ be the lattice of characters of the torus of $V$ . They pick the rational cone given by $\sigma := \operatorname{Cone}(\mathscr{A})\subseteq N_{\mathbb{R}}$ , and the affine semigroup given by $\mathsf{S}_\sigma := \sigma^\vee \cap M$ . They claim that the obvious inclusion $\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}]\hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}_\sigma]$ induces a morphism at the level of varieties, $\operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}_\sigma]) \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}])$ which is a normalization map. What I tried to do so far is to prove using the plain definition of normalization map, that if $\alpha$ is in the fraction field $\operatorname{Frac}(\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}])$ and satisfies a monic polynomial equation with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}]$ then it has to be an element of $\mathbb{C}[\mathsf{S}_{\sigma}]$ . I suspect, however, that if one could prove first that the normalization of an affine toric variety is again an affine toric variety (without necessarily being precise of who the lattice, torus and action are), then the characterization of normal toric varieties given by Theorem 1.3.5 could be used somehow. Any help would be highly appreciated.","['affine-varieties', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-combinatorics', 'toric-varieties', 'commutative-algebra']"
4061953,Can we define the set of reals as the set containing all the convergences of the sequences?,"My analysis teacher defined the set of reals as, and I quote, a collection of finite numbers $\{A_0, A_1, ..., A_n\}$ and a collection of finite or infinite numbers $\{d_1, d_2, ..., d_m, ...\}$ all in the range $0$ to $9$ ; we match this collection with $x_+=+A_n...A_1A_0.d_1d_2...d_m$ a positive real $x_-=-A_n...A_1A_0.d_1d_2...d_m$ a negative real For example, $\pi=3.141...$ is defined such as $A_0=3$ , $d_1=1$ , $d_2=4$ , $d_3=1$ , ... I find this definition very strange, as it seems to be based on syntax alone (or almost). In the rest of the course, we went on to discuss Cauchy sequences and the Cauchy criterion and what it implies: The sequence $(U_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges if and only if it is a Cauchy one. This equivalence gives $\mathbb{R}$ the property of being a complete set, i.e. any Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges in $\mathbb{R}$ . My intuition then led me to think that the set of reals could be defined as the set containing all the limits of the real Cauchy suites. However, this is only an intuition and I don't know how to show this, I haven't found any result on the internet. I wonder therefore if this intuition is good, if not (or if it is, because it is always interesting), I would like to know in what other ways we could define the reals, other than by the definition I gave above. PS: obviously, we could define $\mathbb{R}$ in ensemblistic terms, and say that it contains all naturals, integers, rationals and irrationals, but I was looking for another definition than in terms of sets.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-numbers', 'real-analysis']"
4062051,What if we take step functions instead of simple functions in the Lebesgue integral [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Pull the teeth out of Lebesgue integration (2 answers) Closed 3 years ago . When we define the Lebesgue integral, we first define it for simple functions $s(x) = \sum\limits_{j=1}^n c_j\chi_{A_j}(x)$ (where $A_j$ are measurable) as $\int sd\mu = \sum\limits_{i=j}^n c_j \mu(A_j)$ and then for $f\ge 0$ as $\int fd\mu = \sup\{\int sd\mu$ : s simple and $0\le s\le f\}$ . But I was wondering what could go wrong if instead of taking simple functions in the supremum, we would take step functions, i.e. $s(x)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^nc_i\chi_{I_j}(x)$ where $I_j$ are intervals (any type, like $(a,b), (a,b], [a,b), [a,b])$ ).","['measure-theory', 'simple-functions', 'lebesgue-integral', 'step-function']"

4062121,Properties of a sequence generated by a function,"Suppose $\mathcal{B} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$ is a sequence of integers generated by some function $\mathcal{D}$ such that we have $$\prod_{i = 1}^{k}a_i \quad \text{always divides}\quad\prod_{i = n - k + 1}^{n}a_i$$ for every positive integer $k$ . Note that here $n$ is greater than or equal to $k$ . Let us call this property of the sequence as product property. What can be function $\mathcal{D}$ in general which will generate the sequence satisfying the product property? Are there any conditions on sequence $\mathcal{B} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$ which implies that the product property is satisfied? For example if we say function $\mathcal{D}$ that generates the sequence is $n^2$ that is we have $\mathcal{B} = \{1,4,9,16,25 \ldots\}$ then it's easy to see that it satisfies the property that is $$\prod_{i = 1}^{k}i^2 \quad \text{always divides}\quad\prod_{i = n - k + 1}^{n}i^2$$ for every positive integer $k$ . Similarly if we say function $\mathcal{D}$ that generates the sequence is $n(n + 1)$ then also it satisfies the product property that is we have $$\prod_{i = 1}^{k}i(i + 1) \quad \text{always divides}\quad\prod_{i = n - k + 1}^{n}i(i + 1)$$ My main question is Are there any conditions on sequence $\mathcal{B} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$ which implies that the product property is satisfied? Are there any conditions on sequence $\mathcal{B} = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$ which implies that the product property is not satisfied? What are some more example of the sequence $\mathcal{B}$ which satisfy the product property? I have worked on this problem for a very long time but didn't succeed to get any strong conditions. However I have found many example of the sequence $\mathcal{B}$ which satisfy the product property. I have generated these sequences from some trial and error method, however I am struggling with the conditions part which would imply if the the sequence satisfies the product property or not.

4062160,What is a counterexample to LaSalle invariance principle?,"I realized I have never understood LaSalle's invariance principle because I have never seen a counterexample to it. LaSalle's invariance principle is usually stated as, Let $\Omega \subset D$ be a compact set that is positively invariant

continuously differentiable function such that $\dot V(x) \leq 0$ in $\Omega$ . Let $E$ be the set of all points in $\Omega$ where $\dot
 V(x) = 0$ . let $M$ be the largest invariant set in $E$ . Then every
solution starting in $\Omega$ approaches $M$ as $t\to \infty$ . For example, is it possible to come up with an example where the largest invariant set in $E$ is the empty set, hence we do not have conclusion? or as a corollary to it Let $x = 0$ be an equilibrium point of $\dot x = f(x)$ . Let $V : D ⊂ R ^n → R$ be a
continuously differentiable, positive definite function on $D$ such
that $\dot V (x) ≤ 0$ for all $x ∈ D$ . Assume that no solution, other
than the trivial solution $x(t) ≡ 0$ , can stay identically in $\{x ∈ D

I’ve made two observations: If such an $A$ exists, it’s measure must be infinity, since $$\lambda(A\cap \mathbb{R})=\lambda(A)=\frac{\lambda(\mathbb{R})}{2}$$ If such an $A$ exists, it cannot contain an open subset $U$ , since $$\lambda(A\cap U)=\lambda(U)=\frac{\lambda(U)}{2} $$ which implies that an open set has nonpositive measure, a contradiction. Past these observations I’m stuck, and have no real intuition on whether this thing should exist or not. My gut says no, as it seems too convenient to let us pick among every open set and this nice equality holds, but I can’t seem to pin a contradiction. I was hoping there would be some implication that the measure of $A$ was also finite, which would imply that it couldn’t exist.","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure']"
4062225,Why does the equation of the circumference of a circle in spherical and hyperbolic space satisfy $C''=-KC$?,"In a space of constant curvature $K$ , the function for $C(r)$ where $C$ is the circumference of a circle of radius $r$ satisfies: $C''=−KC$ , with initial conditions $C(0)=0$ and $C'(0)=2\pi$ . (Units check: Gaussian curvature $K$ is units $1/\rm length^2$ , $C$ is units $\rm length$ , and $C''$ is units $1/\rm length$ .) When $K=0$ , as in flat space, this gives us the familiar $C=2\pi r$ that we all know and love. When $K>0$ this gives us $C=2\pi\frac{\sin(r\sqrt K)}{\sqrt K}$ , and when $K<0$ this gives us $C=2\pi\frac{\sinh (r\sqrt{-K})}{\sqrt{-K}}$ . Is there an intuitive reason why $C''=-KC$ holds? In other words, is there an intuitive reason why $C''/C$ is constant in surfaces of constant curvature? (The initial conditions $C(0)=0$ and $C'(0)=2\pi$ are, I think, pretty intuitive.) I think the explanation lies in Jacobi fields, but I forget the details of how those work. We can frame the question in a different way. Given a point $p$ and any function $C$ , we can ""grow"" a manifold around $p$ such that $C$ is the circumference of circles of radius $r$ around $p$ . This gives us a whole family of manifolds, including for example the paraboloid, but the resulting manifold only looks the same at every point when $C''/C$ is constant. (You can make circles grow like $C$ from a given point, but unless $C''/C$ is constant, you'll have trouble making them grow like that from every point.)
