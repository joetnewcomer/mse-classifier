544690,Variance for mixed distribution (continuous + discrete),"A random variable X has the cumulative distribution function: $F(x)=
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
0 \text{ for x < 1}\\ 
\cfrac{x^2-2x+2}{2} \text{ for } 1 \le x <2\\ 
1 \text{ for } x \ge 2

\right. 
$ Calculate the variance of x. I know the definition of variance is:  $Var[X]=E[X^2]-E[X]^2$ so we proceed by calculating each term. $E[X]=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx\tag{1}$ $E[X^2]=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^2f(x)dx\tag{2}$ So to evaluate equations (1) and (2), we need to calculate the PDF.  This is where I am confused.  I know the PDF is the derivative of the CDF.  Also, we note that $F(2)-F(1) = 1/2$ and by definition $F(\infty)=1$. This forces the probability for $x<1$ to be 1/2.  Is this correct?  How would we write the system of equations for the PDF below?  I don't really see how this is a combination of discrete and continuous if the limits are $(x<1), 1 \le x < 2, x \ge 2$.  Can someone please explain this and breakdown $E[X],E[X^2]$? $f(x)=

I'm not sure how to go about proving this direction, though.  I don't think contradiction or contrapositive are useful, because assuming the set of non-units is not an ideal doesn't seem to give anything useful.  However, showing this directly seems difficult too, because we don't know anything about the set of non-units in an arbitrary ring (it may not even be closed under addition).

544764,Morphism of vector bundles,"I have some doubts on the definition of morphism of vector bundles.

My first doubt is the following: if $f$ is restricted to $E_p$, then it's clear that $f|_{E_p}$ has domain $E_p$, but I think that it has target in $E'_p$, and not in $E'_{f(p)}$. I've thought this because, if $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are the projections on $B$ of $E$ and $E'$ respectively, then, since $f$ is a morphism of bundles, $f={\pi'}^{-1}\circ \pi$. So $f(E_p)=f(\pi^{-1}(p))={\pi'}^{-1}(\pi(\pi^{-1}(p)))={\pi'}^{-1}(p)=E'_p$.

There is consensus, however, that the actual sum is $\frac{1}{2}$. Why? I understand the approach of finding partial means of the series, and they do indeed tend to $\frac{1}{2}$, but it seems unintuitive to assert that the sum is neither $1$ or $0$. A more convincing method I found was assuming the series is $S$, then shifting it such that $S-1 = S$, then through algebra finding $S = \frac{1}{2}$, but again, it seems more intuitive answer is either $0$ or $1$. I say this strictly because adding and subtracting integers should equal an integer, never a fraction.

Is there any way to prove this equality, and are there any generalizations of this conjecture to include other parameters? P.S. Not that it's overly relevant to the question, but for the interested reader, the original integral comes from the following physics problem: [Morin Intro to Classical Mechanics , Ex. 10.12] The earth bulges slightly at the equator, due to the centrifugal force in the earth’s rotating frame. The goal of this exercise is to find the shape of the earth, first incorrectly, and then correctly. (a) The common incorrect method is to assume that the gravitation force from the slightly nonspherical earth points toward the center, and to then calculate the equipotential surface (incorporating both the gravitational and centrifugal forces). Show that this method leads to a surface whose height (relative to a spherical earth of the same volume) is given by $h(\theta)=R\big(\!\frac{R\omega^2}{6g}\!\big)(3\sin^2⁡\theta-2)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle (the angle down from the north pole), and $R$ is the radius of the earth. (b) The above method is incorrect, because the slight distortion of the earth causes the gravitational force to not point toward the center of the earth (except at the equator and the poles). This tilt in the force direction then changes the slope of the equipotential surface, and it turns out (although this is by no means obvious) that this effect is of the same order as the slope of the surface found in part (a). Your task: Assuming that the density of the earth is constant, and that the correct height takes the form of some constant factor $f$ times the result found in part (a), show that $f=5/2$. Do this by demanding that the potential at a pole equals the potential at the equator.","['closed-form', 'calculus', 'integration', 'conjectures', 'elliptic-functions']"

Answer: Here the pigeons constitute a $6$ elements subset of $\{1, 2, \dots 9\}$ and the pigeonholes are the subsets $\{1,9\}$ , $\{2, 8\}$ , $\{3,7\}$ , $\{4,6\}$ , $\{5\}$ . The $6$ pigeons go to the their respective pigeonholes, they must fill at least one of the $2$ element subsets whose members sum to $10$ . There are ${9\choose 6}=84$ subsets. A lot of these don't add up to $10$ ; e.g,. $(1,2)$ and $(1,3)$ The subsets are the pigeonholes, thus the pigeonhole principle doesn't work.

Set the following map $\varphi : S_n\to \mathcal{I}$ given by $\varphi(f) = (f(1),\dots,f(n))$. If we denote $A=\varphi(S_n)$, the obviously $\varphi$ is surjective over $A$. Also, it's injective, because if $\varphi(f)=\varphi(g)$, then for each $i$, $f(i)=g(i)$ and hence $f=g$. In that case $|S_n|=|A|$. Finally, to find $|A|$ we argue as follows, if $(i_1,\dots,i_n)\in A$, then there's a function $f : I_n\to I_n$ that is bijective and such that $i_k = f(k)$. Because of that, there are $n$ possible values for $i_1$. When such a value is selected, since the function must be injective, there are remaining $n-1$ values for $i_2$, and so on, until $i_n$. In that case, there are $n!$ objects to choose, and hence $|S_n|=n!$. I think this proof is not good, I feel it's not rigorous. Is this proof allright? If not, how can I improve it?

545814,"I've seen ""hyperbolic rotation"" - from this: generalization to multisection rotation: is this possible?","This question is more in recreational mathematics area By accident I came across the concept of ""hyperbolic rotation"" where we use a matrix containing $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ instead of the trigonometric $\cos$ and $\sin$ for the rotation by matrix-multiplication such that we have:
$$ \tag{trigonometric} \qquad T_t(\varphi) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \varphi &  \sin \varphi \\  -\sin \varphi &  \cos \varphi  \end{bmatrix} $$ $$ \tag{hyperbolic} \qquad T_h(\varphi) = \begin{bmatrix} \cosh \varphi &  \sinh \varphi \\  \sinh \varphi &  \cosh \varphi  \end{bmatrix} $$ A key-feature is surely, that both rotation-matrices have a determinant of $1$ ( because $$\small \cos^2(\varphi) + \sin^2(\varphi) = 1 \tag{trigonometric}  $$ and $$\small \cosh^2(\varphi) - \sinh^2(\varphi) = 1 \tag{hyperbolic} $$ ) . Now I toyed a bit to extend this to the case of 3-multisection series of the exponential; an example for what I mean is my older question ; let's call that three functions just $f(x),g(x),h(x)$ such that $f(x)+g(x)+h(x) = \exp(x)$ and the analogon to the square-formulae which equal $1$ is:
$$ f(x)^3  + g(x)^3 + h(x)^3 - 3f(x)g(x)h(x) = 1 \tag{3-multisection} $$ At least, such a ""rotation""-matrix must have size of $3 \times 3$ but possibly even more - if it is constructable at all. Qu1: Is such a generalization to higher multisections (here order 3) possible? Qu2: and if, how could such a ""rotation""- matrix be contructed? [Update]: I've just found, that
 $$ \tag{3-multisection} \qquad T_{3m}(\varphi) = \begin{bmatrix} f(\varphi) & h(\varphi) & g(\varphi)\\  g(\varphi)&f(\varphi)&h(\varphi)\\ h(\varphi) & g(\varphi) &f(\varphi)  \end{bmatrix}$$
has determinant $1$ and could be a candidate model. But I didn't find nice properties so far. Perhaps it is even better to not to stick to the determinant 1-condition, but allow determinant $-1$ here; the ""rotation""-matrix could then be a simple circulant one, like in the hyperbolic case. The log of that matrix looks like
$$ \log(T_{3m}(\varphi))=\small \begin{bmatrix} 
 0 & 0 & \varphi \\ 
 \varphi & 0 & 0 \\ 
 0 & \varphi & 0
 \end{bmatrix}$$
and I think it is a good hint, that this is equivalent to the rotation-matrices in the trigonometric/hyperbolic-cases, where the form of the matrix-log comes out to be much similar.","['matrices', 'trigonometry', 'special-functions', 'rotations']"

545947,Versal extensions of algebras,"I am reading the beginning of Sernesi's book ""Deformations of algebraic schemes"", and I am stuck on an example of a versal extension. Background : $A\to R$ is a fixed ring homomorphism. By an $A$- extension of $R$ (by $I$) we mean an exact sequence $0\to I\to R'\to R\to 0$, where $R'$ is an $A$-algebra and $I^2=0$. By a morphism of extensions we mean a commutative diagram where $h$ is an $A$-algebra homomorphism.
An $A$-extension is said to be versal if it has a morphism to any other $A$-extension. In the book, it is claimed the following: if $P$ is a polynomial $A$-algebra and $R=P/I$, then $$0\to I/I^2\to P/I^2\to R\to 0$$ is a versal extension. Questions : I would like to see why the above exact sequence admits a
  morphism to any other extension. Furthermore, it is also claimed that
  such a $P$ always exists (for a fixed $A$-algebra $R$). Why is that
  true? It seems that any $A$-albegra is the quotient of a polynomial

Other than that there does not seem to be any sort of pattern (I checked up to $n=50$).  Are there any known special cases where the problem becomes easier?  As a place to start I was thinking of using $e_p(n!)$ defined as: $$e_p(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left \lfloor\frac{n}{p^k}\right \rfloor$$ Which counts the exponent of $p$ in $n!$ (Legendre's theorem I believe?) Then knowing the prime factorization of $n$ perhaps we can determine if these primes appear more times in the numerator of $\binom{n}{k}$ than the denominator.

After, you transform the above to: $$-2\sqrt{1-\cos(x)}\cot\big(\frac{x}{2}\big)+\text{constant}$$ The expression is indeterminate at $2\pi$ and $0$ of the form $0 \times \infty$. So I guess you would set up a limit and then use L'Hospital's rule to evaluate the expression at $2\pi$ and $0$ and get the answer to the definite integral? In any case, all this seems strange.

This reminded me of my earlier work, so I went to Wikipedia to see if there's any big updates. I found this claim The longest progression for any initial starting number less than 100 million is 63,728,127, which has 949 steps. For starting numbers less than 1 billion it is 670,617,279, with 986 steps, and for numbers less than 10 billion it is 9,780,657,630, with 1132 steps.[11][12] Now, do I get this correctly: there is no known way to pick a starting number $N$, so that the progression will last at least $K$ steps?

546194,Questions on positive definite matrices,"First, in this discussion, I am only considering real matrices.  Second, I have a few questions I am ruminating on related to symmetric matrices.  Some of these questions I need someone to say my logic is correct while others I need you to help provide the logic. I am curious as to what the closure of the set of positive definite matrices is.  I know that this set is an open cone.  Just thinking about it seems to point to the closure being the positive semi-definite matrices.  However, I cannot think of a way to prove this.  Also, is the closure in the set of symmetric matrices, the same as the closure in the set of all matrices.  I believe this to be the same as any sequence of symmetric matrices should be a symmetric matrix. Also, is every symmetric matrix, either positive definite, negative definite or in the boundary of both?  Again this seems somewhat logical but I don't know why. Finally, if the closure of the positive definite matrices is the positive semi-definite ones, do all the matrices in the boundary have determinant zero?  This seems true as I believe these matrices have at least one eigenvalue as $0$ implying $0=det(A-\lambda I)= det (A-0I) =det (A)$.  If I was wrong about the closure is there any way to characterize the matrices in the boundary? Thanks!","['general-topology', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
546216,Definition of a logarithm,"My question is as follows: Is the below a useful elementary way of dealing with negative arguments? If not, what is a better (elementary or not) way of dealing with negative arguments of the logarithm? How could you extend those methods to complex arguments? Today I was in pre-calculus and was playing around with $\pi$ approximations (having finished my work), because I recently did a probabilistic Buffon's Needle $\pi$ approximation and accompanying proof for an AP stats project, and was interested in other $\pi$ approximations. While doing this I came upon this reasoning: 
$$  e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0  \Rightarrow  \ln(-1)=i\pi . $$
Which I generalized to:
$$ \log_{b}(x) = \log_{b}(x) + \frac{i\pi}{\ln(b)}; x < 0.$$
I then defined the logarithm function in a recursive way for all arguments $ x \in \mathbb{R} 
\wedge x \not= 0$ as follows:
$$ \log_b(x) = \begin{cases} 
      \log_b(x) & x > 0 \\
      \log_b(x) + \frac{\pi i }{\ln(b)} & x < 0 
   \end{cases}
$$
Because my pre-calculus teacher had said that the logarithmic function was not defined for negative arguments, and I knew complex analysis extends the logarithm (but I am not there yet, I just started real analysis) to complex arguments, I assumed there was not elementary way of dealing with negative arguments (although from the definition of the natural logarithm in calculus I ascertained, but never proved, that there was a way). There is two obvious problems I can see with my definition, namely it is recursive and in is not continuous at zero edit: I have tried to use the approach of using: $$-\int\limits_{-x}^1 \frac{dt}{t} = \ln(-x)$$ but it got nowhere, so I went back to Euler's identity approach, but more generalized. Here is the argument I came up with: let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We now take the natural logarithm to be well defined for the positive reals, and so $\ln(|x|)$ is well defined. We also take $\log_b(x)$ to be defined as follows:
$$ \log_b(x) := \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)} $$ We will show that $$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x)$$ lemma: First we show that 
$$\ln(-|x|) = \pi i + \ln(|x|)$$ We consider $e^{zi} = \cos(z) + i \sin(z)$ where $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and $z$ is modulo $2 \pi$. we can see that $ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) = zi$, if we let $\cos(z) + i \sin(z) = -1$ then $z \equiv \pi \bmod{2\pi}$. Now we look back and and expand our original equation:
$$\ln(-|x|) = \ln(-1) + \ln(|x|)\ \ .$$ Now we can substitute $\ln(-1)$ with $\ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z))$, where we have restricted $z$ to $-2\pi \leq z \leq 2\pi $ and we say it is equal to $\pi$. We get
$$\ln(-|x|) = \ln(-1) + \ln(|x|) = \ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) + \ln(|x|) \ \ .$$ Now we can see that because $ln(\cos(z) + i \sin(z)) = zi$ we can say:
$$\ln(-|x|) = \pi i + \ln(|x|)\ \ \  \Box$$ Now we use this result to show our original conjuncture  $$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x) \ \ .$$ Because we defined $\log_b(x)$ as $\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$ we can see that
 $$\log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\ln(-|x|)}{\ln(b)}$$ which, via our lemma, we see is
$$\log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i + \ln(|x|)}{\ln(b)}$$ which is simplified to
$$\forall x, \log_b(-|x|) = \frac{\pi i}{\ln(b)}+ \log_b(x) \ \ \ \ \blacksquare$$ This argument, I think, is a bit stronger than starting at the special case $e^{\pi i} -1 = 0$. I have also considered the logarithm through the integral $$\int \frac{dx}{1+ax} = \frac{1}{a}\ln(1+ax) + C$$, but haven't seen if it would be fruitful to follow this path.","['logarithms', 'algebra-precalculus', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"
