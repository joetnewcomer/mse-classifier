575638,Gramian Matrix and Non-negative Eigenvalues,"I'm trying to write up solutions for my Linear Algebra students, and I can't seem to figure out this one part of a proof. They are told that a matrix $A$ is called Gramian if $$A=B^tB$$ for some real, square matrix $B$. They are then asked to prove that $A$ is symmetric (trivial) and that all of its eigenvalues are non-negative (which is the part I'm stuck on). I've tried looking up properties about Gramian matrices, but everything mentioned relates them to positive semidefinite matrices, which my students have not read anything about. I also know that $B$ and $B^t$ have the same eigenvalues, but I don't think they would have to have the same eigenvectors. Maybe I'm just tired, but any help proving this without mentioning ""positive semidefinite"" is much appreciated.","['linear-algebra', 'eigenvalues-eigenvectors']"

If $AP$ and $PQ$ are perpendicular, which means their product equal to $0$, I tried many ways but can't get $(\vec{AP})(\vec{PQ})=0$ or $(P-Q)(A-P)=0$, and I let centre $O$ be the origin.

Mathematica gives the answer $\frac{1}{2}\log (2\pi)-1$ but I have no idea how one would obtain that (also I feel like Stirling's Approximation is somehow involved since it seems to like the number $\log (2\pi)$ and concerns itself with the relationship between exponentials and factorials). Motivation: This gives a pretty cool relation, even if it probably can't be used for anything.  $$ \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{e}=e^{\int_o^1 \log(\Gamma(x+1))\mathrm dx}=\lim_{n\to\infty} e^{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^n \log(\Gamma(\frac{k}{n}+1))}=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(\prod_{k=0}^n\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{n}+1\right)\right)^{1/n} $$ TL;DR: How can we solve the integral, is the value related to Stirling, and if so, how?","['integration', 'number-theory', 'definite-integrals', 'gamma-function', 'recreational-mathematics']"

575805,composition of two uniformly continuous functions.,"Let $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $g : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are two uniform continuous functions. Which of the following options are correct and why? $f(g(x))$ is uniformly continuous. $f(g(x))$ is continuous but not uniformly continuous. $f(g(x))$ is continuous and bounded. My attempt: Every uniformly continuous function maps a Cauchy sequence to a Cauchy sequence. (Here I have a doubt, as the converse may not be true). So if $\{x_n\}$ be a Cauchy sequence, $\{f(x_n)\}$ and $\{g(f(x_n))\}$ both will be Cauchy sequence. So $g(f(x))$ will be uniformly continuous, i.e. 1 is true. Composite function of two continuous functions will be continuous. As 1 is true, 2 is false. $f(x) = x $ is uniformly continuous. $g(x) = \log(x)$ is uniformly continuous in $[1,\infty)$. So $g(f(x)) = \log(x)$ is uniformly continuous in $[1, \infty)$, but not in $\mathbb{R}$.

575959,A connection between nonplanar complete graphs and the alternating group?,I went to an undergrad's senior honors thesis presentation a few days ago. She was discussing crossing numbers and mentioned that complete graphs $K_n$ are nonplanar iff $n \geq 5$. ?Coincidentally? $A_n$ (the alternating group of even permutations) is a nonabelian simple group iff $n \geq 5$.

575995,Intuition for Lebesgue integration,"I have started doing Lebesgue integration and I just want to clarify one thing to start with. Very loosely speaking, with Riemann integration we partition the domain into $n$ intervals, and then we calculate the area of the $n$ rectangles formed by a base of width $n$ and a height of where each rectangle 'hits' the function. Summing these rectangles gives us an approximation of the area of the graph under the function. Then as we let $n \to \infty$ this approximation increase in accuracy and equals the function when we take the limit. Now with Lebesgue integration do we follow the same process of partitioning (the range this time) into $n$ intervals and then letting $n \to \infty$ giving us smaller and smaller intervals which implies the approximation to the function keeps increasing?

 Then I want to check the continuity at $0$, $$
\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=\infty, \quad f(0)=2.

Since $\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)$ exists (going to infinity doesn't mean that limit doesn't exist right?) and $f$ is not continuous at $0$, isn't this a removable discontinuity? Because if limit at that point exists and f is not continuous at that point it is a removable discontinuity and otherwise it is essential discontinuity. 2)

So I claim that $ C \cong C_0 \oplus \mathbb C$  because every converge sequence I can write like this: let $\{x_n\}_{n=1} ^ \infty$  that converge to $d$ then we can look at the following sequence  $y_n =(x_n- d) + d $

More algebraically, given finitely generated extension fields $K$, $K'$ of transcendence degree 1 over an algebraically closed field $k$, such that their purely transcendental extensions $K(t)$ and $K'(t)$ of degree one are isomorphic, how do we conclude that $K$ and $K'$ are isomorphic (without passing to their curves/surfaces over $k$ and applying geometric tools)? Addendum. I should explain my intention. First of all, the geometric statement induces an algebraical (more precisely field theoretical) statement, I wouldn't believe if there weren't this geometric interpretation (and the proof, of course). I expect that an algebraical proof (if known) is hard, but it would be nice to know if there was at least an algebraical reason why this should be true.","['algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'field-theory']"

Show that the following statements are equivalent: (1) $(E_i)_{i\in I}$ are independent events (2) $(\sigma(E_i))_{i\in I}$ indepedent (3) $(1_{E_i})_{i\in I}$ independent. Before I show you my proof, I'll give you the theorems resp. definitions we had in our reading in order to be able to use them here. Definition 1 A family $(\mathcal{E}_i)_{i\in I}$ with $\mathcal{E}_i\subset\mathcal{A} (i\in I)$ is called independent, if for any finite subset $I_0\subset I$ and any choice $E_i\in\mathcal{E}_i, i\in I_0$, it is
$$
\mathbb{P}(\bigcap_{i\in I_0}E_i)=\prod_{i\in I_0}\mathbb{P}(E_i).
$$ Theorem 1 Is $(\mathcal{E_i})_{i\in I}$ independent in the sense above and all $\mathcal{E}_i\cup\left\{\emptyset\right\}$ are closed under $\cap$, then $(\sigma(\mathcal{E}_i))_{i\in I}$ is independent. Definition 2 The family $(X_i)_{i\in I}$ of random variables is called independent if $(\sigma(X_i))_{i\in I}$ is independent. I think Definition 1 , Definition 2 and Theorem 1 are exactly what I need for my proof. Here it is: Proof $(1)\implies (2)$: Let $(\mathcal{E}_i)_{i\in I}$ with $\mathcal{E}_i\subset \mathcal{A} (i\in I), \mathcal{E}_i=E_i, E_i\in\mathcal{A}, i\in I$ be an independent family. Then $\mathcal{E}_i\cup\left\{\emptyset\right\}=\left\{E_i,\emptyset\right\}, i\in I,$ is closed under sections, because $E_i\cap E_i=E_i\in\mathcal{E}_i$ and $E_i\cap\emptyset=\emptyset\in\mathcal{E}_i$. Corresponding Theorem 1 then $(\sigma(\mathcal{E}_i))_{i\in I}=(\sigma(E_i))_{i\in I}$ is independent. $(2)\implies (3)$: Suppose that $(\sigma(E_i))_{i\in I}$ is independent. For all $i\in I$ it is $\sigma(1_{E_i})=\sigma(E_i)=\left\{\Omega,\emptyset,E_i,E_i^C\right\}$ so $(1_{E_i})_{i\in I}=(\sigma(E_i))_{i\in I}$. So corresponding Definition 2 the family $(1_{E_i})_{i\in I}$ is independent. $(3)\implies (1)$: Suppose that $(1_{E_i})_{i\in I}$ is independent, i.e. $(\sigma(1_{E_i}))_{i\in I}=(\left\{\Omega,\emptyset,E_i,E_i^C\right\})_{i\in I}$ is independent. By Definition 1 that means that for any finite subset $I_0\subset I$ and for any choice $X_i\in\left\{\Omega,\emptyset,E_i,E_i^C\right\}$ it is $\mathbb{P}(\bigcap_{i\in I_0}X_i)=\prod_{i\in I_0}\mathbb{P}(X_i)$. So consider any finite subset $I_0\subset I$ and choose $X_i=E_i, i\in I_0$. Then it is $\mathbb{P}(\bigcap_{i\in I_0}E_i)=\prod_{i\in I_0}\mathbb{P}(E_i)$. Corresponding to the definition that is given in the task itself, that means that $(E_i)_{i\in I}$ is independent. $\diamondsuit$ Please give me a feedback if my proof is right or not.

(If not, please point out my mistake, as my question is based on the assumption that my above requirements are equivalent to that.) According to MathWorld , the curve of constant width with minimal area is the Reuleaux triangle with an area of $\frac12(\pi-\sqrt3)\,d^2\approx0.705\,d^2$, and that of maximal area is the circle with $\frac14\pi\,d^2\approx0.785\,d^2$. I'm willing to trust that statement. On the sphere But how about other geometries, spherical geometry in particular? The usual definition of width in terms of parallel tangents won't work since there are no parallel geodesics on the sphere. But the above definition should still work on the unit sphere. For example, consider $w=\frac\pi2$. The equivalent of the Reuleaux triangle would be a simple spherical triangle with three right angles, since every point on a boundary is $\frac\pi2$ away from the opposite corner. Its area is $\frac12\pi\approx1.571$. The circle with diameter $\frac\pi2$ (and hence radius $\frac\pi4$) has area $$\int_{\frac12\sqrt2}^2 2\pi\,\mathrm dx

$$\displaystyle  \frac{xy}{z} + \frac{xz}{y} + \frac{yz}{x} \geq x+y+z \text{ for all }  x,y,z \in \mathbb{R^+}$$ It's easy to show that this inequality holds by applying the AM-GM inequality three times like the following: $$ \frac{xy}{z} + \frac{xz}{y} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{xy}{z} \cdot\frac{xz}{y}} = 2x$$
$$ \frac{xy}{z} + \frac{yz}{x} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{xy}{z} \cdot\frac{yz}{x}} = 2y$$
$$ \frac{zy}{x} + \frac{xz}{y} \geq 2 \sqrt{\frac{zy}{x} \cdot\frac{xz}{y}} = 2z$$ Then summing these inequalities and canceling a factor of $2$ at the end will give us the desired inequality. But if you look at the problem from another point of view, if we substitute $x'=\lambda x$, $y'=\lambda y$ and $z' = \lambda z$ the inequality stays the same. So, I was wondering if there could be another way of solving this inequality and the inequalities that are homogenous like this one in a more systematic way that could be applied to a broader range of problems. I decided to add a constraint $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$ to the problem because the inequality in the problem could be thought of as a function in the three variables $x,y,z$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The question is general but i would like to add my view of things. I started to teach myself topology through several books a couple of months ago. I already passed the point of being overwhelmed by the amount definitions. Most of them I remember although sometime i check to remind myself (I have, after all, a terrible memory). The point is most of the theorems and exercises I prove don't sink in and usually whenever I'm given a statement to prove I start with the definitions and work up from there. My feeling is that it's part of the nature of the subject. Browsing through Counterexamples in Topology really makes my head turn (all the one way implications... what ever happened to ""if and only if""?) This is in contrast to when I’m doing problems in analysis where i have a visual picture which tells me usually straight away if a given statement is true or false even before i start proving it. I think that time here is a key element and intuition will inevitably develop at some point and so my question is: Is there any efficient way to develop intuition in topology? By intuition I mean a mental model that helps you see things more clearly for example: 
If you’re given a space with certain properties (say first countable, countably compact hausdorff space) than your intuition tells you it has to have some other properties ($T_3$ in this case).","['general-topology', 'intuition', 'soft-question']"
