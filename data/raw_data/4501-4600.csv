Consider vectors $(a_i)$ and $(b_i)$ of length $m$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^m a_i = \sum_{i=1}^m b_i$. Then, we say that $a$ majorizes $b$ if $\sum_{i=1}^k a_{(i)} \geq \sum_{i=1}^k b_{(i)}$ for each $1 \leq k \leq m$, where $a_{(i)}$ denotes the $i$th largest element of $(a_i)$ and likewise for $b_{(i)}$ with respect to $(b_i)$.

33153,Definition of a Differential Equation?,"Here is one definition of a differential equation: ""An equation containing the derivatives of one or more dependent variables, with respect to one of more independent variables, is said to be a differential equation (DE)"" (Zill - A First Course in Differential Equations) Here is another: ""A differential equation is a relationship between a function of time & its derivatives"" (Braun - Differential equations and their applications) Here is another: ""Equations in which the unknown function or the vector function appears under the sign of the derivative or the differential are called differential equations"" (L. Elsgolts - Differential Equations & the Calculus of Variations) Here is another: ""Let $f(x)$ define a function of $x$ on an interval $I: a < x < b$ . By an ordinary differential equation we mean an equation involving $x$ , the function $f(x)$ and one of more of its derivatives"" (Tenenbaum/Pollard - Ordinary Differential Equations) Here is another: ""A differential equation is an equation that relates in a nontrivial way an unknown function & one or more of the derivatives or differentials of an unknown function with respect to one or more independent variables."" (Ross - Differential Equations) Here is another: ""A differential equation is an equation relating some function $f$ to one or more of its derivatives."" (Krantz - Differential equations demystified) Now, you can see that while there is just some tiny variation between them,
calling $f(x)$ the function instead of $f$ or calling it a function instead of an
equation but generally they all hint at the same thing. However: ""Let $U$ be an open domain of n-dimensional euclidean space, & let $v$ be a vector field in $U$ . Then by the differential equation determined by the vector field $v$ is meant the equation $x' = v(x), x \in U$ . Differential equations are sometimes said to be equations containing unknown functions and their derivatives. This is false. For example, the equations $\frac{dx}{dt} = x(x(t))$ is not a differential equation.""

above definitions, in all of the standard textbooks, are in fact incorrect. Would anyone care to expand upon this point if it is of interest as some of you
might know about Arnold's book & perhaps be able to give some clearer examples than $\frac{dx}{dt} = x(x(t))$ , I honestly can't even see how to make sense of $\frac{dx}{dt} = x(x(t))$ .
The more explicit (and with more detail) the better! A second question I would really appreciate an answer to would be -

that Arnold does? I can't find any elementary book that starts by
defining differential equations in the way Arnold does and then goes on

33245,Solving differential equation $y^{(5)} + 2y^{(3)} + y' = 2x + \sin(x) + \cos(x)$,"I'm trying to solve the differential equation $$L[y] = y^{(5)} + 2y^{(3)} + y' = 2x + \sin(x) + \cos(x)$$ using the method of undetermined coefficients. I'm having a problem in that my solution differs from that given, and I am trying to find out why. First we note that the characteristic equation is $$r^5 + 2r^3 + 1 = r(r^2 + 1)^2$$ whose roots are $0$ and $\pm i$ twice. So the complementary function to the homogeneous case $L[y]=0$ is 
$$C_0 + C_1 e^{ix} + C_2 e^{-ix} + C_3 x e^{ix} + C_4 x e^{-ix}.$$ Now to tackle the particular solution. So I thought if I solve the differential equation for each of the terms of the right hand side, namely Solve $L[y]=2x$, $L[y] = \sin x$ and $L[y] = \cos x$ then add them up, I will get a particular solution. The first involving a linear function is easy, $y_p$ for that just works out as $x^2$. However for the other two involving trigonometric functions, I try and solve $L[y] = e^{ix}$ and take the imaginary and real parts respectively for $L[y]=\sin x$ and $L[y]=\cos x$. Now as my R.H.S. is $e^{ix}$ which is already contained in the complementary function, I make the ansatz that my $y_p$ should be of the form $Bx^2 e^{ix}$. So calculating substituting this ansatz for $y_p$ into the differential equation $L[y] = e^{ix}$ and comparing coefficients, I get that $B = \frac{i}{8}$, so that $$y_p = \frac{ie^{ix}}{8}$$ and $$\text{Re}(y_p) = \frac{- \sin x}{8},\qquad \text{Im}(y_p) = \frac{\cos x}{8}.$$ So the full solution to my differential equation $L[y] = 2x + \sin x + \cos x$ is $$y_c + y_p = C_0 + C_1 e^{ix} + C_2 e^{-ix} + C_3 x e^{ix} + C_4 x e^{-ix} + x^2 + \frac{- \sin x}{8} + \frac{\cos x}{8}.$$ But when I check the solution given it says that my cosine and sine terms have to have a $x^2$ term in the front of them. What's wrong, is my initial guess not right? Ben",['ordinary-differential-equations']

Let $X$ be an infinite dimensional Banach space - over the reals for the sake of concreteness. Use choice to produce a Hamel basis $(x_i)_{i \in I}$ for $X$. I have the impression that this basis should necessarily interact badly with the topology and, therefore, not be of much (any?) use for doing analysis on $X$, but I've never really thought about why this should be the case. Is there a rigorous sense in which we can say that this basis is ""useless""? One way to make this precise (although I'd be interested in other points of view) might be to consider the corresponding linear functionals $(f_i)_{i \in I}$ - uniquely determined by taking $f_i(x_j)$ equal to $1$ or $0$ according as $i=j$ or not. I would be very surprised if it were possible for any of these functionals to be continuous, but this conviction is based only on my vague notion that a Hamel basis for $X$ must be somehow ""pathological"" and not on any sound reasoning. Because I have no idea how to approach this question (admittedly also because I don't think this is a particularly constructive thing to be dwelling on at this time of year...)

Edit for clarity: I actually already know at most finitely many of the coordinate functions can be continuous (see comment below) which is, now that I think about it, a fairly critical failure in and of itself and probably enough to justify the word ""useless"" above.

So I do the following, but I am not sure if they are right. Let $g(x) = \sin x$. Then let $f(x) = x - \frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} = x - \tan x$. As $f(x)$ is continuous on $(\pi/2,3\pi/2)$ and differentiable on this interval excluding the endpoints, then the mean value theorem says that $\exists c \in [\frac{\pi}{2}+\epsilon, \frac{3\pi}{2}-\epsilon]$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$ where $b = \frac{3\pi}{2} - \epsilon$, $a= \frac{\pi}{2} +\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$. Now (is this right?) that if $x_0$ is in this interval, then $\exists c_0$ such that $f'(c_0) = \frac{f(\pi)-f(x_0)}{\pi - x_0}$, as $(x_0,\pi)\subset(\frac{\pi}{2} +\epsilon,\frac{2\pi}{2}+\epsilon)$. (b) Now as $x_0,x_1,\ldots$ are the sequence of approximations of $\pi$ then either $x_0 < x_1 \ldots$ or $x_0 > x_1 \ldots$, depending on whether the $x_i's$ approach $\pi$ from the left or right, as $x - \tan(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(\pi/2,3\pi/2)$. In other words, this means that $(x_0,\pi) \supset (x_1,\pi) \supset \ldots$. (Can I deduce this from the above?) So here are several bits that are bothering me. If I look at (b) above, it is sort of assuming that my sequence is strictly increasing and bounded above, and hence is convergent (which is what i am supposed to prove later on on). Also, if $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on $(\pi/2,3\pi/2)$, then does it mean that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable on a subinterval of $(\pi/2,3\pi/2)$? Thanks,

This is a kind of converse to Cauchy's Theorem that every group of order divisible by a prime $p$ contains an element of order $p$. This is obviously true when $d$ is such that there is more than a single isomorphism type of groups of order $d$; just take any such non-cyclic group and you're done. But there are composite numbers $d$ for which every group of order $d$ is cyclic (I think these numbers, along with the primes themselves, are called ""Cyclic numbers"").

Probability kernel is then a measure kernel with $\pi(X|y) = 1$ for every $y \in Y$. Now, this definition is a little abstruse, so I'd like to gain some intuition about it. I can see similarities with usual kernels of operators (because measure is a generalization of a function, at least naively). Also, I can think of the kernel as a collection of measures indexed by $y \in Y$. But I am not sure which of these two views (or if any) gives much insight into why this concept is natural and useful. What is the intuition behind the probability kernels? What are some applications that show their usefulness? To be more precise about what I am after. There is a definition of group action $\rho$ of group $G$ on set $M$ as $\rho : G \times M \to M$ satisfying certain axioms. But this doesn't really give me any insight.

For a given triangle, how can one show that the line joining the midpoints of two legs is orthogonal to the perpendicular bisector of the third? Suppose you're given a triangle $ABC$ with midpoints $D$, $E$ and $F$. Armed with the parallel postulate, it is fairly easy to prove that all the smaller triangles $ADE, DBE, FEC, DEF$ are congruent, and so $D$ and $DE\parallel BC$, from which it follows that the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ is also perpendicular to $DE$. But in neutral geometry, there is no parallel postulate, so I don't see a way to make a similar argument. I think I lose any information about $DE$, $DF$ and $EF$ concerning congruences. How could one then show that $FG\perp DE$? At best, I was able to prove it in the special case that $ABC$ is equilateral using repeated side-side-side arguments, but I can't find a proof for any arbitrary triangle.

33631,Series of nested double integrals,"This is kind of a follow-up of my previous question . I'm investigating the following infinite series of nested two-dimensional integrals $$\sigma(t,t^\prime) = 1 - \int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_1 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_1}\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t_1,t_2) + \int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_1 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_1}\mathrm dt_2 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_2}\mathrm dt_3 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_3}\mathrm dt_4 \, \Delta(t_1,t_2) \, \Delta(t_3,t_4) + \cdots \;,$$ with $\Delta(t_1,t_2)$ a complex function obeying the relation $$\Delta(t_1,t_2) = \Delta^*(t_2,t_1) \;.$$ I'm looking for a representation of $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$ that can be calculated in completeness (the above infinite sum obviously isn't very useful in a concrete application). Treating $t^\prime$ as constant and taking the derivative of $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$ with respect to $t$ I obtain $$\frac{\mathrm d \sigma(t,t^\prime)}{\mathrm d t} = - \int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t,t_2) \, \sigma(t_2,t^\prime) \;,$$ which after re-integrating and using the boundary condition $\sigma(t^\prime,t^\prime) = 1$ yields the recursion relation $$\sigma(t,t^\prime) = 1 - \int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_1 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_1}\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t_1,t_2) \, \sigma(t_2,t^\prime) \;.$$ However, I don't know how to solve either of these two equations for $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$. In view of my previous question my first guess was to inspect $$\sigma_1(t,t^\prime) = \exp \left[ -\int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_1 \int_{t^\prime}^{t_1}\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t_1,t_2) \right] \;.$$ Obviously $\sigma_1(t^\prime,t^\prime) = 1$, but taking the derivative of $\sigma_1(t,t^\prime)$ with respect to $t$ at constant $t^\prime$ yields $$\frac{\mathrm d \sigma_1(t,t^\prime)}{\mathrm d t} = - \int_{t^\prime}^t\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t,t_2) \, \sigma(t,t^\prime) \;,$$ which is different from the derivative of the original series $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$ (see above). Still, to first order in $\Delta(t_1,t_2)$ the derivatives are equal and thus $$\sigma(t,t^\prime) = \sigma_1(t,t^\prime) + \exp\left[\mathcal{O}\left(\Delta^2 \right) \right] \;,$$ which is actually quite acceptable to me, since in my case $\Delta(t_1,t_2)$ is a small perturbation. Nevertheless, I'm wondering if one can obtain a better solution to the problem. Edit 1 I discovered the following propagator property of $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$ $$\sigma(t,t_1) \sigma(t_1,t^\prime) \stackrel{!}{=} \sigma(t,t^\prime) \;,$$ which follows from the fact that $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$ represents the interaction part of a Keldysh Green's function, i.e. $$G(t,t^\prime) = G_0(t,t^\prime) \sigma(t,t^\prime) \;,$$ with $G_0(t,t^\prime)$ and $G(t,t^\prime)$ obeying the propagator relation $$iG_{(0)}(t,t_1) iG_{(0)}(t_1,t^\prime) = iG_{(0)}(t,t^\prime)\;.$$ Edit 2 As pointed out by Didier Piau the above propagator property cannot hold, since $$\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm d t} \left( \sigma(t,\bar t) \sigma(\bar t,t^\prime) \right) = - \int_{\bar t}^t\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t,t_2) \, \sigma(t_2,\bar t) \sigma(\bar t, t^\prime) \;""=""\; - \int_{\bar t}^t\mathrm dt_2 \, \Delta(t,t_2) \, \sigma(t_2, t^\prime) \;,$$ which is obviously different from $\frac{\mathrm d \sigma(t,t^\prime)}{\mathrm d t}$ (see above). Edit 3 I verified that the above propagator property does in fact only hold for the unperturbed Green's functions $G_0(t,t^\prime)$, but in general not for the full ones $G(t,t^\prime)$ and thus not for $\sigma(t,t^\prime)$.","['power-series', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'integration', 'integral-transforms']"

33644,Problems that differential geometry solves,"Recently, I've been studying a course in differential geometry. Some keywords include (differentiable) manifold, atlas, (co)tangent space, vector field, integral curve, lie derivative, lie bracket, connections, riemannian geometry, symplectic geometry. However, I've been wondering what problems in pure mathematics that are obvious and interesting can be solved with tools from differential geometry. In other words what questions could one ask that will motivate the study of differential geometry for someone who's interested in pure mathematics mainly. Please don't limit yourself to merely stating a problem, but include a hint, full solution, or reference on how exactly differential geometry becomes useful. Here are some possible answers with my own comment that may inspire you: It's a great language to formulate problems in physics. That may be true, but unfortunately I don't care about pysics (enough). It's a language to talk about differential equations, which are ""naturally interesting"". But honestly, I don't think I care about applications to differential equations, knowing that what it comes down to in the end is that the equations are rammed into a computer and brutally 'solved' by numerical methods anyway, no matter how fancy you formulate them. Perelman's solution of the Poincaré conjecture, which may be considered a topic in pure mathematics, uses differential geometry. Apparently it does, but isn't that a bit like using Wiles' solution to FLT as a motivation for a course in commutative algebra? It provides deeper insights in the whole of mathematics. Well, I just made that up. But maybe it provides a wealth of examples in, for instance, topology, or maybe techniques can be borrowed from differential geometry and used in other branches. But then again, doesn't it make more sense to study them where they become interesting? As a final example, a simple question that I consider motivating for exploring groups beyond their definition would be: "" how many groups of order 35 are there? "": it's an easy question, only refering to one easy definition with a somwhat surprising answer where the surprise vanishes once you've developed a sufficient amount of theory. ps - Since there is no best answer to my question maybe it should be community wiki. I'm sure some moderator will do what's appropriate. pps - In reply to Thomas Rot's answer I must apologise for the tone when I'm talking about differential equations. Actually I'm a person who obtained a degree in applied physics before turning over to ""pure"" (in a sense that I don't mind if it's hard to find applications in real life situations) math. I've seen how these people solve differential equations -- I've seen how I used to do it Myself, actually. No cute mathematical theory, just discretize everything and put it into a computer. If it doesn't work out, let's try a finer grid, let's leave out a term or two, until it works. 
Surprisingly they don't use cotangent spaces to even state the problem, still it appears sufficient to calculate the heat distribution in nuclear reactors, or calculate the electron density around a deuteron.
Because I've seen all this and didn't think it is pretty, I've turned away from it. But feel free to change my mind on the subject.","['big-list', 'differential-geometry']"
33659,Infinite dimensional integral inequality,"Let $f \colon \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a measurable function.

The idea was to rewrite the inequality this way $$\left\lVert \int_0^t f(s,\cdot)\, ds\right\rVert_q \le \int_0^t \lVert f(s, \cdot) \rVert_q\, ds,$$ which looks so obviously true... But I'm afraid of some pitfall here. In fact, we cannot guarantee continuous dependence of $f$ on the first variable, so $\int_0^t f(s, \cdot)\, ds$ is not the usual Riemann integral in a Banach space. What do you think: is this approach leading somewhere or I'd better try another one? (Which one, just in case? :-) ) EDIT: Answer I've found a very satisfactory answer in Hardy-Littlewood-Polya's Inequalities (@Willie Wong: thank you!). I'm glad to expose it here (with slightly different language, in case you ask). Theorem Let $\Omega_t, \Omega_x$ be $\sigma$ -finite measure spaces and $f \colon \Omega_t \times \Omega_x \to [0, \infty]$ be a measurable function. If $1 < p < \infty$ then $$\left\lVert \int_{\Omega_t} f(s, \cdot)\, ds\right\rVert_p \le \int_{\Omega_t}\lVert f(s, \cdot) \rVert_p \,ds,$$ where $\lVert \cdot \rVert_p$ refers to $L^p(\Omega_x)$ . Lemma Let $\Omega$ be a $\sigma$ -finite measure space and $J \colon \Omega \to [0, \infty]$ a measurable function. If $1 < p < \infty$ and $F \ge 0$ then the following statements are equivalent: $\lVert J \rVert_p \le F$ ; $\forall g \in L^{p'}(\Omega), g \ge 0, \int_{\Omega} g^{p'}dx \le 1$ we have $\int_{\Omega}Jg\, dx \le F$ . Proof of Theorem Let $J(y)=\int_{\Omega_t}f(s, y)\, ds$ . $J$ is a measurable positive function on $\Omega_x$ . Take $g \in L^{p'}(\Omega_x), g \ge 0, \int_{\Omega_x}g(y)dy \le 1$ . Then by Fubini's theorem and Hölder's inequality we have $$\int_{\Omega_x}J(y)g(y)\, dy = \int_{\Omega_t}ds \int_{\Omega_x}f(s, y)g(y)dy\le \int_{\Omega_t}\left(\int_{\Omega_x}f(s, y)^p dy\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\, ds, $$ that is, $\int_{\Omega_x}J(y)g(y)dy\le \int_{\Omega_t} \lVert f(s, \cdot) \rVert_p\, ds$ and so $\lVert J \rVert_p \le \int_{\Omega_t} \lVert f(s, \cdot)\rVert_p\, ds$ by the lemma.    //// The general principle here is very interesting: if you want to prove an inequality like $\int J^p\, dx \le \text{something}$ , you can get past that annoying exponent $p$ by proving $\int Jg\, dx \le \text{something}$ for all suitable $g$ . References Hardy-Littlewood-Polya, Inequalities : my Theorem is their Theorem 202 , my Lemma is their Theorem 191 . EDIT 2020 Let us see how to prove the Lemma. It looks MUCH tougher than it actually is. We don't actually need any functional analysis to prove it, no dual spaces or anything like that. The proof that 1. $\Rightarrow$ 2. is literally just an immediate application of the inequality of Hölder. The proof that 2. $\Rightarrow$ 1. is based on the obvious computation $$
\lVert J^{p-1}\rVert_{p'}=\lVert J\rVert_p^{p-1}, $$ which motivates us to write $$
\lVert J\rVert_p^p=\lVert J\rVert_p^{p-1}\int J(x)\frac{J^{p-1}(x)}{\lVert J^{p-1}\rVert_{p'}}\, dx, $$ and now we can apply the assumption 2 to bound the integral, because $\frac{J^{p-1}(x)}{\lVert J^{p-1}\rVert_{p'}}$ has $p'$ norm equal to 1. We conclude $$
\lVert J\rVert_p^p\le \lVert J\rVert_p^{p-1} F, $$ from which 1. immediately follows. $\Box$ Remark . As stressed by the book Analysis of Lieb and Loss, in the case of $L^p$ spaces the abstract functional analysis is not necessary, and it actually sometimes obscures what is going on. This is a good example of that phenomenon. This edit comes nine years after the original question, one of my first ones. I am still here.

$$
T_f (\phi) = \int f \phi ,
$$
where the integral is taken over $\Omega$ $\phi \in \mathscr D (\Omega)$ is a test function (I'm assuming $\mathbb R^n = \mathbb R$ for simplicity), and then the distributional derivative of $f$ can be represented as 
$$
\frac{d}{dx} T_f (\phi) = - \int f \frac{d \phi}{dx} .

I am working on some mathematical treatment for Cournot duopoly models (not homework, just preparing for a test tomorrow). A simple two player Cournot model is of the form $p=1000-q_1-q_2$ where $p$ stands for price, and $q_i$ is the quantity produced by firm $i$. The payoffs of each firm are given by $pq$ minus some marginal cost times $q$, say $-10q$. In this case, to find best response for firm $i$, I would take its payoff function $\pi_i=(1000-q_i-q_j)q_i-10q_i$ and take its derivative with respect to $q_i$, getting $1000-2q_i-q_j-10$. I would then set it equal to $0$, solving for $q_i$, and getting $q_i=\frac{990-q_j}{2}$, thus getting an expression maximizing $\pi_i$ in terms of $q_j$. Doing the same thing with $q_j$, I get $q_j=\frac{990-q_i}{2}$ since the function is symmetric. Then I set equations equal to each other/substitute one into the other, and get the Nash equilibrium (profit maximization for both), easy. The issue I am having is dealing with $n$ firms. Assume a>c>0, b>0. Suppose we have total quantity of output $Q=\sum_{i=1}^{n} q_i$ and price be given as $p=a-bQ$. Then let profit of firm $i$ be defined as $\pi_i=p(Q)q_i-cq_i=(a-bQ)q_i-cq_i$. Defining $Q_{-i}$ to denote the sum of quantities of all firms but of firm $i$, we can rewrite the profit function of $i$ as $\pi_i=(a-bq_i-bQ_{-i})q_i-cq_i$ (observe that $q_i+Q_{-i}=Q$). From here on, I can again take a partial derivative with respect to $q_i$, and find the payoff maximization function to be $\pi_i'=a-2bq_i-bQ_{-i}-c$. Rewriting for $q_i$, I get $q_i=\frac{a-bQ_{-i}-c}{2b}$. So, for an arbitrary firm $j$, the maximization function in terms of $Q_{-j}$ will be given by $q_j=\frac{a-bQ_{-j}-c}{2b}$. The problem I have here is that I can't anymore substitute as easily as I did in the first example with only two firms. The book gives me a hint: Summing the best-response functions over the different players will help. I do not know what to make of it. Could you explain how to find an intersection given $n$ such functions in the form presented above? EDIT: I might be onto something here, feedback appreciated! So I decided to follow the books advice and see what comes of it. Summing both sides of $q_i=\frac{a-bQ_{-i}-c}{2b}$ over all the players I get $q_1+\dots +q_n=Q=\frac{na}{2b}-\frac{nc}{2b}-\frac{(n-1)(q_1+\dots + q_n)}{2} \to 2Q=\frac{na}{b}-\frac{nc}{b}-(n-1)(q_1+\dots + q_n)$=$\frac{na}{b}-\frac{nc}{b}-(n-1)(Q) \to (n+1)Q=n\frac{(a-c)}{b} \to Q=\frac{n}{n+1} \frac{(a-c)}{b}$. Thus $q_i=\frac{n}{n+1} \frac{(a-c)}{b} - Q_{-i}$. Hopefully I am at least on the right track, though I can't see where this leads me yet.","['multivariable-calculus', 'game-theory', 'nash-equilibrium']"
33778,CDF of a ratio of exponential variables,"Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent exponential variables with rates $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Find the CDF of $X/Y$. I tried out the problem, and wanted to check to see if my answer of: $\frac{\alpha}{ \beta/t + \alpha}$ is correct, where $t$ is the time, which we need in our final answer since we need a cdf. Can someone verify if this is correct?","['statistics', 'probability-distributions']"
33781,eigenvalues and eigenvectors for rectangular matrices,"We can generalize matrix inverses from non-singular square matrices to rectangular matrices in general, for example, the well-known Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. I am wondering how this can be done for eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Though $\det(|A-\lambda I|)=0$ cannot be used any more when $A$ is not square, there is nothing that prevents one to consider $Av=\lambda v$ for non-zero vector $v$ except the possibility of having an inconsistent linear system. Please give your comments and provide some references if there are some. Many thanks. Edit I know SVD. But it does not seem to be the one I wanted. For SVD of real matrix $A$, $A=UDV^T$ where $U, V$ are orthogonal matrices and $D$ is diagonal (with possibly zeros in the diagonal). We only have $AV_{*k}=\sigma_{k}U_{*k}$, $V_{*k}$ is the $k^\text{th}$ column of $V$. Since $V_{*k}$ and $U_{*k}$ are in general different, it does not resemble $Av=\lambda v$ for non-zero vector $v$ in the definition of eigenvectors. Also, even if we can have $A^TAV_{*k}=\lambda V_{*k}$, but this is for the (square) matrix $A^TA$, rather than $A$ itself.",['linear-algebra']
33786,Meaning of a partial derivative here?,"I am given a 'tariff' function for two countries, $i=1, 2$. Both players can select a tariff between 0 and 100. If player $i$ selects $x_i$ and player $j$ selects $x_j$, country $i$ gets a payoff of $$2000+60x_i+x_ix_j-{x_i}^{2}-90x_j.$$ I need to find a Nash equilibrium for this game. Taking a derivative with respect to player 1, I get $$\pi_1'=60+x_2-2x_1,$$ so the payoff is maximized when $$x_1=\frac{60+x_2}{2}.$$ Symmetrically, for $x_2$, $$x_2=\frac{60+x_1}{2}.$$ Substituting one equation into the other, we get $x=60$ for both players. This makes sense, as both countries' lowering the tariff, to, say, 30 would increase their profits (which is something mentioned by the textbook -- equilibrium not necessarily optimal). My question is, what exactly is the meaning of the profit function for player 1 differentiated with respect to $x_2$? I get $x_1=90$ if I set the derivative equal to $0$, and I am wondering if this has any significance within the game theoretic model.","['multivariable-calculus', 'game-theory', 'nash-equilibrium']"
