430895,"""Natural"" constructions of tensor fields from tensor fields on a manifold","This question begins is related to this question on physics.SE Uniqueness of Riemann Curvature Tensor , which asks roughly ""what tensors can we make locally out of just the metric tensor? We can clearly make a (3,1) tensor out of just the metric, but we can't seem to locally make a vector field out just the metric. I gave an answer there on which I'd appreciate comments. What I'd like to ask here is Can we formalize the intuition of making a tensor out just the metric tensor? The formalization I have come to is: constructing a tensor of type $A$ out of just a tensor of type $B$ is the same as a natural transformation between the two functors that assign to each manifold the space of tensors of type $A$ & $B$ respectively. When I say a tensor ""of some type"", I mean specifying the number of upper and lower indices as well as possibly antisymmetrization/symmetrization of indices and any other $GL(n)$ invariants you can slap on. So symmetric, nondegenerate (0,2) tensor is a type. (1) Is the above definition good? Does it capture the intuitive idea of ""making a tensor field out of just another one""? Or am I missing something simple? Does this have an established name (other than natural transformation)? The transformations from a fixed type form a tensor algebra inherited from $T(V)$: we can add, multiply by constant scalars, tensor products, contractions, symmetrizations - any $GL(n)$ invariant operation. This is kind of trivial since it doesnt know anything about the manifold, it's inherited from the vector space. So we just want to talk about the generators of this algebra, which always includes at least the trivial objects (i) identity map and (ii) map everything to $1$. (2) Have the generators of this algebra been classified, or studied? . Or is this just asking someone to ""list all the geometrical invariants ever"" using fancy words? Assuming it is, some bonus questions (3)Can anyone find a counterexample to this extreme conjecture: The entire algebra is generated by (i) metric curvature object, (ii) exterior derivatives and (iii) Hodge duals all composed with tensor algebra? (As a physicist these are the only natural geometric objects I can think of. Sad physicist) (4)Is the only nontrivial transformation of a 2-form in $d=4$ the exterior derivative? (5)Is there any nontrivial transformation of a symmetrized tensor of type (0,3)? Sorry if that's a lot of questions, I just find this pretty cool. Caveats 'n such Everything is smooth. I really want real analytic but I will settle for $C^\infty$. Probably we need to work on connected manifolds to remove some issues involving ""constant"" scalars taking values on different components. The natural transformation have lots of other algebraic structure I dont know what to do with, including regular composition. Edited drastically from an earlier version to pointless wall of words.

430910,Ramanujan and sum of four cubes,"This is more a question on History than proof itself. About a decade ago, a college professor and a Math coach told us about this beautiful theorem: Every multiple of 6 can be written as a sum of four cubes The proof of the theorem is elementary as well as elegant. Consider $(n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 = 2n^3 + 6n$ Thus, $6n = (n+1)^3 + (n-1)^3 + (-n)^3 + (-n)^3$ Effectively proving the theorem and also giving the required four numbers. The professor also made a remark that a proof is due to Ramanujan. I recently found this scribbled in my notebook and have since not been able to find any reference to this on the web. As far as I know, Kennigel's biography, 'The Man Who Knew the Infinity' does not mention it. There are tons of references to Taxicab numbers, Sum of four square proofs etc..

430921,Is the number of irreducibles in any number field infinite?,"Are there infinitely many irreducibles in the ring of integers of any algebraic number field ? I tried to follow the same argument as we usually do for integers. Suppose there are finitely many irreducibles, say $p_1,\ldots ,p_n$ and let $\alpha :=1+ p_1\cdots p_n$. Now if $\alpha $ is not a unit then it must have an irreducible $p$ such that $p|\alpha$ but then $p$ can not be any of the $p_i$'s and we have a contradiction. $\textit{What if $\alpha$ is an unit ? Is it possible for $\alpha$ to be an unit ?}$ Of course, one can replace $p_1\cdots p_n$ by $p_1^{k_1}\cdots p_n^{k_n}$ for any $k_1,\ldots ,k_n\in\mathbb{N}$ and the same argument would go through.","['algebraic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"

430948,Base step of induction in Hartshorne III 9.5,"Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a flat morphism of schemes of finite type over a field k. For any point $x\in X$ , let $y = f(x)$ . Assume that $\operatorname{dim} Y = 0$ . Hartshorne now claims that $X_y$ is defined by a nilpotent ideal in $X$ . Why? I made the following attempt: If $Y$ is of dimension zero, then, in the classical case, we have a variety $X$ mapping to a bunch of isolated points. Since $y = f(x)$ , if we further assume that $X$ is connected, then the whole of $X$ maps to $y$ . So, indeed, $X_y$ is the whole of $X$ , and the whole of $X$ is defined by a nilpotent ideal. But how does it work in the general case? How does one prove, in the scheme setting, that if $Y$ is zero-dimensional then every component of $X$ maps to a (obviously closed) point of $Y$ ? And how does one prove first that $X_y$ is defined by a nilpotent ideal, instead of deducing it from the fact that it is the whole space?",['algebraic-geometry']

I was able to prove the ""$\Leftarrow$"" part of this: Since $\tau_h$ is shape regular we have $C>0$ such that for all $T\in\tau_h$ we have $\rho_T/h_T \geq C>0$ whereas $\rho_T$ is the radius of the in-circle of $T$ and $h_T$ the radius of the out-circle of $T$.
Using some trigonometric relations we find $$\rho_T=4h_T\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)$$ and so we have $\rho_T/h_T = 4\sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{\gamma}{2}\right)$.
Since $\alpha/2, \beta/2, \gamma/2$ are all smaller than 90° we can estimate this by $\rho_T/h_T \geq 4\sin^3\left(\frac{\theta_0}{2}\right)=:C>0$ and hence we have shown the ""$\Leftarrow$""-part. What I haven't been able to prove was the other direction.
Assuming I have some constant $C>0$ such that $\frac{\rho_T}{h_T}\geq C > 0$, how can I derive the existence of a lower boundary  $\theta_0>0$ for the smallest angle ?","['trigonometry', 'triangulation', 'partial-differential-equations', 'numerical-methods']"
431016,Why don't the roots of this characteristic equation correspond to the given solution of this 2nd order ODE?,"I am asked to solve $$ y'' + 9y = 6\mathrm{sin}(3x) $$ using the method of undetermined coefficients . The characteristic equation of this 2nd order ODE is $$ \lambda^2 + 9\lambda = 0 $$ and its roots are $0$ and $-9$. These are both real and different, so the general solution of the homogenous equation ought to be $$ y = c_1e^{0x} + c_2e^{-9x} $$ which is the same as $$ y = c_1 + c_2e^{-9x} $$ In my table of reasonable guesses for the particular solution of the inhomogenous equation, it says that for output functions of the form $\textrm{sin}(\beta x)$, $\textrm{cos}(\beta x)$, the particular solution will be of the form $$ y_p = A\cdot\textrm{sin}(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) $$ if $i \beta$ is not a root of the characteristic equation, and $$ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $$ if $i \beta$ is a root of the characteristic equation. So, given our output function $6\sin(3x) $, $\beta = 3$, and if we test it, substituting $3i$ in the characteristic equation, we get $$(3i)^2 + 9(3i) = -9 + 27i \neq 0 $$ so it seems clear that $i \beta$ is not a root, and so I expect that the particular solution would be of the form $$ y_p = A\cdot\textrm{sin}(3x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(3x) $$ Except that it's not, and it wasn't until someone told me to try substituting the output function in the ODE that I realized this. Only $ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $ works. Is my formulary wrong, or have I misunderstood something here? Using $ y_p = x\left[ A\cdot\sin(\beta x) + B\cdot\textrm{cos}(\beta x) \right] $ as the reasonable guess, the particular solution turns out to be $-x\cos 3x$. So the general solution should be $$ y = c_1 + c_2e^{-9x} -x\cos 3x $$ but when I try solving this ODE with various tools, I get $$ y = c_1\cos(3x) + c_2\sin(3x) -x\cos(3x) $$ which I do not understand.

I believe the answer is yes. Here is my attempted proof: We use the following characterization of absolutely flat rings (Chapter
  2, Exercise 27 in Atiyah & Macdonald). $A$ is absolutely flat ring $\Leftrightarrow$
  $(x)=(x^2)$ for each $x\in A$. Now, suppose $x^{n}=0$ for
  $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $n$ is minimal. If $x\neq 0$, we necessarily
  have $n\ge 2$. Since $(x)=(x^2)$, we have $x=ax^2$ for some $a\in A$. Thus,
  $x^{n-1}=ax^{n}=0$, contradicting minimality of $n$. Hence, $x=0$ is
  the only nilpotent element of $A$. Is my proof correct? I have done Chapter 2, Exercise 28 in Atiyah & Macdonald, which lists important properties of absolutely flat rings, but this simple property was not mentioned there.","['commutative-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'solution-verification']"

431329,Proof of a Property of Vertical Asymptotes,"I'm trying to understand a proof in my Calculus textbook of the following theorem: Let the functions $f$ and $g$ be continuous on an interval containing
  $c$. If $f(c) \neq 0$, $g(c) = 0$, and there is an open interval
  containing $c$ such that $g(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \neq c$ in the
  interval, then the graph of the function $h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
  has a vertical asymptote at $x = c$. The proof the textbook provides is the following: Consider the case for which $f(c) > 0$, and there exists $b > c :$ 
  $c < x < b \implies g(x) > 0$. For $M > 0$, choose $\delta_{1}$
  and $\delta_{2}$ such that: $0<x-c<\delta_1 \implies \frac{f(c)}{2} <f(x)<\frac{3f(c)}{2}$ $0<x-c<\delta_2 \implies 0 < g(x) < \frac{f(c)}{2M}$ Set $\delta = min\{\delta_1, \delta_2\}$. Then $0 < x-c < \delta \implies \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} > \frac{f(c)}{2} \cdot \frac{2M}{f(c)}=
> M$, which implies that $\lim_{x \to c^+}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \infty$,
  so $x = c$ is a vertical asymptote of the graph of $h(x)$. What I'm wondering is what the point is of Saying that there exists $b > c : c < x <  b \implies g(x) > 0$ Restricting $f(x) < \frac{3f(x)}{2}$ The way I understand the proof, $\frac{f(c)}{2}$ and $\frac{f(c)}{2M}$ were simply chosen because they cancel nicely when multiplied, correct?

431331,Does this morphism necessarily give rise to a finite extension of residue fields?,"Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of finite type of locally Notherian schemes. Let $x\in X$ and $y=f(x)$. Recall that $f$ is said to be unramified if the map of stalks $g:\mathcal O_{Y,y} \rightarrow \mathcal O_{X,x}$ satisfies $g(m_y)=m_x$, where $m_x$ denotes the maximal ideal of the quotient ring. The condition on the maximal ideal shows that this map descends to a map $k(y)\rightarrow k(x)$. Is this necessarily a finite extension? I believe so, because taking appropriate affine neighborhoods, we can reduce to the case of a map of affine schemes with associated ring map $A\rightarrow A[t_1,\dots,t_n]$ for some elements $t_i$ of the ring of global sections of $X$. It seems to me after the localization and quotienting happens to get the map of residue fields, the second ring (now a field) should still be finitely generated over the first. Unfortunately, I don't know enough commutative algebra to do this rigorously. Is this correct? If so, what is the proof? My motivation comes from studying étale morphisms, where the finiteness of the extension above is usually presupposed.

431501,What exactly is a vector bundle isomorphism,"Recall that a vector bundle (of rank $n$) is a family of vector spaces $V_x$ of dimension $n$ that is parameterized by a topological space $X$. In addition there is a continuous surjective map $\pi: E \to X$ where $E$ is also a topological space. On top of this it is required that for every $x \in X$ there be an open set $x \in U$, some $k$ and a homeomorphism $\varphi: U \times \mathbb R^k \to \pi^{-1}(U)$. (local triviality condition) Two vector bundles are isomorphic if there is a homeomorphism on the total spaces $\phi : E \to E'$ with the property that $\phi|_{\pi^{-1}(x)}: \pi^{-1}(x) \to \pi'^{-1}(x)$ is a linear isomorphism. Consider the example $X = S^1, E = \mathbb R^2$, $k=1$. From reading about vector bundles I know that there exist only two non-isomorphic vector bundles: the Moebius band and the annulus. But why this is so I don't understand: it's not clear to me why these two can't be isomorphic given the definition above and I also don't see why there are no others.

In particular how to link this issue to the Lefschetz fixed point? On the other hand, I have a problem to calculate the index of a vector field in an isolated singular point. If the point is non-degenerate, the calculation is simple. Otherwise, I do not know whether to go through the calculation of topological index of the Gauss map (where calculations are not always easy, because I must start from a regular value $y$, determine the fiber $f^{-1}(y)=\{x_1,...,x_k\}$ and calculate the sum $\sum\mathrm{sign}\det T_{x_i}f$). I am afraid the following reasoning I made is wrong: the Euler characteristic of any Lie group is zero. For this, I start with a compact Lie group, as it is parallelizable, it admits a vector field without singularities and from the Poincaré-Hopf theroem, its Euler characteristic is zero.
By the rigisity theorem of Mostow, any Lie group has the homotopy type of a compact Lie group and therefore also of Euler characteristic zero.

That way, I have a strong connection between $\mathit{S}$ and $\overline{\mathit{S}}$ and can use this notation for all kind of symbols (e.g. $\mathit{S}$ as well as $\mathbb{T}$). I like this since it is consistent. But if I'm using both $\mathit{S}$ and $\overline{\mathit{S}}$ in one definition/lemma/..., I find it unintuitive because I tend to think that $\overline{\mathit{S}}$ is the value of $\mathit{S}$ under some function. So: Is my use of $\overline$ standard notation? Do you know of another standard? or more intuitive notation?

Show that its support either empty, the origin or the whole space. Now, I know that the support of any function $f$ must be closed. This comes from the fact that its complement consists of points on which the germ of $f$ is zero. So the $f$ is also zero in a neighborhood of those points $\Rightarrow$ the complement of the support is open. But then if we take in our case $f = (x-1)(x-2)$, why will the support not be the open set $\mathbb A^2_k- {1,2}$?

431740,Simultaneously (generalized) diagonalizable matrices,"I heard the following theorem from our textbook: Given $A,B$ are two commuting ($AB=BA$) real normal matrices. There's some real orthogonal matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP$, $P^{-1}BP$ are canonical forms. The canonical form of a real normal matrix is a block diagonal whose diagonal blocks are either $\lambda\in\mathbb R$ or \begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix} It could be proved by induction on the size of the matrices. It's well-known that there's a common (complex) eigenvector $v$. If $v$ is a real vector (or a scalar of a real one), then the reduction is obvious. If $v=x+iy$, where $x,y$ are linear independent, since $A$ is orthogonally similar to a canonical form, it's not so hard to show that $x^tx=y^ty$ and $x^ty=y^tx=0$, and $\operatorname{span}\{x,y\}$ is $A$(and $B$)-invariant. However, I'm not satisfied with the proof above. It seems that the paradigm could be generalized as follow: Suppose $A,B$ are semi-simple matrices over a number field $K$ which could be simultaneously diagonalized over $\mathbb C$, then there's some matrix $P$ over $K$ such that $P^{-1}AP$, $P^{-1}BP$ are block diagonal matrices, the characteristic polynomial of whose diagonal blocks are irreducible. Even more, I wonder whether we could stipulate these blocks to be Frobenius normal forms. I don't know, however. Any proof (or disproof) of the preceding statement or any generalization? Thanks!

This is the theorem: Let $A$ be the set such that $A=\{p\in \mathbb{Q}^{+}:p^{2}<2\}$. Then $A$ contains no largest number. The prove given in Rudin's book of analysis goes something like this: Given $p\in A$, let's consider the number
  $q=p-\dfrac{p^2-2}{p+2}=\dfrac{2p+2}{p+2}$. Then
  $q^2-2=\dfrac{2(p^2-2)}{(p+2)^2}$.  This prove that if $p\in A$ then
  $p^2-2<0$, $q>p$, and $q^2<2$. Thus $q\in A$ and $q>p$. Therefore, for
  every $p\in A$ we can find a rational $q\in A$ such that $p<q$. Now here is my problem. First of all I understand the proof perfectly, but I don't see the motivation for finding $q$. Let's suppose I wanted to find $q$ in the set $B=\{p\in Q^{+}: p^{2}<3\}$. I wouldn't now how to find it. Also I would like to know some 'standard', if there is some, process to apply in this cases.

If I set this numbers on the real line I can observe essentially two ways to follow. In the first one, if try to find the number $q^2$ such that $p^{2}<q^{2}<2$ I can think of some of the form $q^{2}=p^{2}+(\dfrac{2-p^2}{n})$ where $n$ is a natural number sufficiently large as necessary (here I'm using Archimedian property) to find a perfect square. In my second approach I'd like to find the number $q$ such that $p<q$. In this case I would think almost in the same way as before. I can think of $q$ as something sufficiently close to $p$ in the form $q=p+\dfrac{1}{n}$ with $n$ sufficiently large so that $p^2<q^{2}<2$. So far I haven't been able to solve the problem with any of my tries and I don't know if I'm in the right direction or it's just an obsession to use the Archimedian property.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis']"

Show that for any bounded set $E$, there is a $G_{\delta}$ set $G$ for which $$E\subseteq G\text{ and }m^*(G)=m^*(E)$$ I want to define $G_n$ to be the the union of open balls of size $1/n$ around every point in $E$, i.e. $G_n=\bigcup_{x\in E}B_{1/n}(x)$. Then take $G=\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+}G_n$ Clearly $E\subseteq G$. Also, $G_n$ is an open set, since it's a union of open balls. Then $G$ is an intersection of a countable collection of open sets.

432086,"$S^1$ is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]/ \{0, 1\}$.","How can I able to show that $S^1$ is homeomorphic to $[0, 1]/ \{0, 1\}.$ I am learning quotient topology from K.D.Joshi's Introduction to GENERAL TOPOLOGY book.
Where he mentioned that, ""Let $f: X\to Y$ be a surjective function. Then $f$ determines an equivalence relation $R$ on $X$ defined by $x R y$ iff $f(x) = f(y)$. The equivalence classes of $R$ are precisely the inverse images of singleton subsets of $Y$. Now let $D$ be the collection of all equivalence classes under $R$. $D$ is called the quotient set of $X$ by $R$ and is also denoted by $X/R$. There is a canonical function $p : X \to X/R$, called the projection which assigns to each $x \in X$, its equivalence class under $R$. The function $\theta : Y \to 
X/R$ defined by $\theta(y) = p(x)$ for any $x \in f^{-1}(y)$ is obviously a well-defined 
bijection. Suppose now that $X, Y$ are topological spaces and that $f$ is a quotient map. On $X/R$, we put the strong topology generated by the projection function $p$. The function $\theta$ then becomes continuous as its composite with $f$ viz., $\theta\circ f$ is continuous. Similarly $\theta^{-1}$ is continuous. Thus $\theta$ is now not merely a bijection but a homeomorphism. Thus, up to a topological equivalence, we may identify the quotient space $Y$ with the quotient space $X/R$ and the quotient map $f$ with the projection $p$. $S^1$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space of $[0, 1]$ obtained from the decomposition $D$ whose members are ${0, 1}$ and all singleton sets $\{x\}$ for $0 < x < 1$. By his notations How can I find $f$ and $\theta$. Can someone help me please?

432101,The same destination regardless of origin,"When I was very little, I didn’t understand some basics of the space we live in. We always followed the same directions to get into town, to school, to the grocery store, and so on. So I figured that by following those directions, we would always arrive at the same destination no matter where we left from . It only happened that we always left from home. In other words, I assumed space was more like a fully-connected graph than the continuous 3-space it seems to be. Vertices were places, and edges were the mystical “directions” by which you could travel between places. This hypothesis didn’t exactly stand up to experimentation. However I am curious to know two things: Suppose a directed graph where outgoing edges are numbered; what does the set of graphs look like where any given path, say, as a list of edge numbers, has a constant destination? Does a (nontrivial) continuous space or surface exist where any given translation $T$ has a constant destination? Examples: A directed graph with one vertex connected to itself. A directed graph with $kn+1$ vertices: a central self-connected vertex and $k$ “spokes” of length $n$. A continuous 0-space.","['general-topology', 'graph-theory']"
432108,Recognizing if a power series is a $q$-expansion of a modular form,"Given a power series in $q$, is it possible to tell if it is the $q$-expansion of a modular form (of level $N$ say)? I don't need to show results of this sort, but it has come up enough that I'm curious how one might approach it. As for an example I have in mind: After playing around with SAGE, in level 2, the modular form $\Delta$ factors into $\delta\gamma^2$, where $\delta$ and $\gamma$ are modular forms of level 2 (this I think I can verify). However, it also appears that $\delta$ and $\gamma$ have the following $q$-expansions:
\begin{align*}
\delta &= q\prod_{n\geq 1}{(1+a(n)q^{n})^{8}},
\end{align*}
where 
\begin{align*}
a(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } n \equiv 1\pmod{2} \\
0 & \mbox{if } n \equiv 2\pmod{4}\\
-1 & \mbox{if } n\equiv 0\pmod{4} \end{cases}
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
\gamma &= \prod_{n\geq 1}{(1-q^n)^{16b(n)}},
\end{align*}
where 
\begin{align*}
b(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if } n \equiv 1\pmod{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} & \mbox{if } n \equiv 0\pmod{2}.\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Finally, if you plug in the product expansions for $\delta$, $\gamma$ in $\Delta = \delta\gamma^2$ and rearrange terms, you get the product expansion for $\Delta$. Now, if we knew that the product formulas were actually modular forms, then the rest should quickly follow. However, how might one show that a power series is from a modular form? (The only thing I know about this is that in Koblitz's book, he derives the product formula from the transformation law for the eta function, which came from the corresponding law for $E_2$. I also know from googling of the phrase ""Bocherds products"" but at first glance they don't seem to be exactly what I'm looking for, though probably very interesting. I also hope I am not posting too many questions on this forum about the same topics, but it's much more useful for me to ask around about something then to keep trying to imagine what the answer might be.)","['power-series', 'modular-forms', 'number-theory']"
432109,Boundaries of finite intersections and unions of sets,"I apologize if this is a duplicate - I looked but didn't find one. This question is sort of a sanity check. Let $A$, $B$ be sets and define the boundaries $\partial A$ and $\partial B$ as usual . Is it true that both  $\partial (A \cup B) \subseteq \partial A \cup \partial B$ and $\partial (A \cap B) \subseteq \partial A \cup \partial B$? It seems obvious, and the proofs seem really easy, but I haven't seen this fact written down anywhere. To get started on the proofs I thought to look at a point $p$ which is in neither $\partial A$ nor  $\partial B$ and then show it is not in either $\partial (A \cup B)$ or $\partial (A \cap B)$ by looking at different cases where $p$ is in the interior or exterior of $A$, $B$, taking intersections of neighborhoods, etc...

How many rationals of the form $\large \frac{2^n+1}{n^2},$ $(n \in \mathbb{N} )$ are integers? The possible values of $n$ that i am able to  find is $n=1$ and $n=3$, so there are two solutions and this seems to be the answer to this problem. But now we have to prove that no more of such $n$ exists, and thus the proof reduces to: Proving that $n^2$ does not divides $2^n+1$ for any $n \gt 3$ . Does anybody know how to prove this?","['problem-solving', 'contest-math', 'number-theory']"
