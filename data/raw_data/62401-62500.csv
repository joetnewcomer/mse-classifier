709126,Integral $ \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{ikx}}{x^{3/2}}dx$,"Hi I'm trying to solve this integral Fourier Transform
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{ikx}}{x^{3/2}}dx=\sqrt{2\pi|k|}(1+i)  (-1+\text{sgn}(k))

where sgn(k)$=1$ for k>1 and $-1$ for k<1.
I am trying to use residues.  Thanks there is a singularity at $x=0$.  We can try and write
$$
e^{ikx}=\cos x+i\sin x
$$
but I don't think it will help.  IT will be nice to use a contour with $e^{ikx}$ instead.  Thanks","['fourier-analysis', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis', 'contour-integration']"

709196,Definition of General Associativity for binary operations,"Let's say we are talking about addition defined in the real numbers. Then, by induction we define $\sum_{i=0}^{0}a_i=a_0$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_i=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i+a_n$ for $n> 1.\:$ Now, how do you define general associativity? I know that this has something to do with the fact that $\sum_{i=0}^{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{k}+\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}$ for $0\leq k<n$, being $\sum_{i=k}^{n}a_i=\sum_{i=0}^{n-k}a_{i+k}$ by definition. But the thing is that this doesn't quite define the notion of different ways of arranging brackets, like for example $(a_0+(a_1+a_2))+((a_3+a_4)+(a_5+a_6))$. So my question is how they formally define this process of bracketing. Think of the case when someone just tell you to prove the general associativity for the real numbers. How do they actually define this property in order to prove it? is it necessary to have one? Look at for example this proof , specifically at the point where professor M. Zuker says: ""Let us now assume that any bracketing of $a_1, a_2,...,a_k$ equals the standard form for $1\leq k\leq n-1$, where $n>3$"". But, then again my question: what is the definition of bracketing? is it actually necessary to have a definition of bracketing or this proof works whatever the definition of bracketing is? Also I have found this paper by William P. Wardlow - A generalized general associative law-  that contains different proofs of this general associativity law. The first one, the one that he suggests as his favorite, is done by Nathan Jacobson in his book ""Lectures of Abstract Algebra"" Vol. 1 page 20. Looking at this proof there is one point where he says ""Consider now any product associated with $(a_1, a_2,..., a_n)$..."", which means ""any bracketing associated with..."". Then again the same question. I hope you understand my point. If not, please fell free of asking anything related to my question. Edit: For clarification let's say we are talking about sum in the real numbers. Then, 1.- $(...(((a_0+a_1)+a_2)+a_3)...+a_n)$ is a representation of the formal definition by recursion, meaning $\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_i$ just as defined above:  $\sum_{i=0}^{0}a_i=a_0$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_i=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i+a_n$ for $n> 1$. 2.- What is the formal definition of $a_0+(a_1+(a_2+...+(a_{n-1}+a_n)...)$ ? 3.- What is the formal definition of something like $(a_0+((a_1+a_2)+a_3))+(((a_4+a_5)+a_6)+....+(a_{n-1}+a_n))$?","['recursion', 'abstract-algebra', 'definition']"
709209,Intuitive idea behind the probability density function,"As an application of Calculus, I am currently teaching some material about continuous random variables. My main example is the height $X$ of a French male chosen randomly in the French population. To explain the probability density function (pdf), I explain that, contrary to discrete variables, knowing $p(X=x)$ is not really interesting (who cares about the probability of being exactly 1.783424567 meter?), but what is of interest is $p(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)$, the probability of being in some interval. So, $p(X=x)$ isn't an interesting one variable function whereas $P(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)=g(a,b)$ is a meaningful function of two variables for probabilities and statistics. But, instead of studying $g$, we prefer to associate to $X$ a pdf, i.e. a function $f$ such that $p(a\leqslant X\leqslant b)=\int_a^b f(x)\ dx$. But what is the reason for the introduction of the pdf? Except saying something like ""this is more convenient and this is the genius idea of modern probabilities"", I had no argument. Could we do probabilities without pdf? What should be a better way to introduce pdf? I have to precise this is aimed to one variable calculus student, with few knowledge of probabilities (finite variables only) and of course, no idea of what is Lebesgue integral (and how it generalizes both sums $\Sigma$ and Riemann integrals).","['calculus', 'probability', 'soft-question']"
709215,Is the gradient operator surjective?,"Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ be open and bounded with Lipschitz
boundary. Is the gradient operator $\nabla :H^{1} ( \Omega ) \rightarrow L^{2}

Sobolev space of real valued functions in $L^{2}$ with weak derivative in $L^{2}$. For unbounded sets in $\mathbb{R}$ the answer is clearly no, since any
compactly supported continuous function is in $L^{2} ( \mathbb{R} )$ but has
non integrable primitive. So, if I try to disprove this for bounded sets, my usual simple test for these
things, the set $( 0,1 ) \subset \mathbb{R}$ and the function $x^{\alpha}$,
which is in $L^{p}$ iff $\alpha >-n/p$ doesn't really help much as a
candidate. Integrating is always possible and yields a function in $H^{1} (
\Omega )$. Ideas? Solution anyone? What about vector valued functions?","['sobolev-spaces', 'analysis']"
709262,Adjacent basic solutions and adjacent bases,"I'm reading chapter 2, entitled geometry of linear programming, of the following book D. Bertsimas, J. N. Tsitsiklis, Introduction to Linear Optimization, Athena Scientific, 1997 I'm having some difficulty with the concept of adjacency as in adjacent basic solutions and adjacent bases . I'll start by collecting a few definitions and results pertaining to adjacency. The page numbers refer to the aforementioned book. Here are the definition related to adjacent basic feasible solutions and edges. Definition 1 (Adjacent basic solutions; p. 53) Two distinct basic solutions to a set of linear constraints in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are said to be adjacent if we can find $n - 1$ linearly independent constraints that are active at both of them. Definition 2 (Edge; p. 53) If two adjacent basic solutions are also feasible, then the line segment that joins them is called an edge of the feasible set. and then we have the following theorem that characterizes edges Theorem 3 (Edges joining adjacent vertices; Exercise 2.15, p. 78) Consider the polyhedron $P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid a_i'x\geq b_i, i = 1, \dots, m\}$ . Suppose that $u$ and $v$ are distinct basic feasible solutions that satisfy $a_i'u = a_i'v = b_i$ , $i = 1, \dots, n - 1$ , and that the vectors $a_1, \dots, a_{n - 1}$ are linearly independent. (In particular, $u$ and $v$ are adjacent.) Let $L = \{\lambda u + (1-\lambda)v \mid 0\leq \lambda \leq 1\}$ be the segment that joins $u$ and $v$ . Then $L = \{z \in P \mid a_i' z = b_i, i = 1, \dots, n - 1\}$ . If we are dealing with a standard polyhedra then concept of a basis comes into the play and we get the following definition for two adjacent bases. Definition 4 (Adjacent bases; p. 56) For standard form problems, we say that two bases are adjacent if they share all but one basic column. The link between adjacent bases and adjacent basic solutions are given by the following theorem. Theorem 5 (Equivalence of adjacent basic solutions and adjacent bases; p. 56) a) Adjacent basic solutions can always be obtained from two adjacent bases. b) Conversely, if two adjacent bases lead to distinct basic solutions, then the latter are adjacent. Here's what I don't understand. Adjacent vertices, like basic solutions, are defined in terms of the way the polyhedron is represented: different representations may yield different basic solutions. However, the property of being a feasible basic solution was shown (Theorem 2.3, p. 50) to be independent of the representation used. Is adjacency of vertices also independent of the representation used? Conversely, is it possible that, given two vertices $u$ and $v$ , they are adjacent under one representation, but not adjacent under a different representation? It seems intuitive that if two feasible basic solutions are adjacent, then the edge between them lies in a hyperplane whose intersection with the polyhedron consists exactly of the points along the edge and furthermore, the hyperplane separates the space into two halves, only one of which intersects with the polyhedron. However, I fall short of proving this formally. I don't see how to prove Theorem 5. It was not proved in the book, but rather dismissed with the phrase: ""it is not hard to check"".","['linear-algebra', 'linear-programming', 'polyhedra']"

Then the system is just
\begin{equation}
\langle\pi,\pi B\rangle=\pi A
\end{equation},
where $\langle.,.\rangle$ is the elementwise multiplication of two vectors. I found that with an arbitrary starting vector $\pi_0$, the following sequence should converge to the unique solution $\pi$:

709590,Universal Property for Tangent Space,"As far as I know there are basically three different approaches to the tangent space -all of them coming with advantages and disadvantages: Though the oldest one precisely represents the derivative on manifolds it is very technical due to this. Thus it is taken out of discussion in most differential geometry lectures and found rarely in literature as in Spivak's comprehensive introduction to differential geometry. Though the more intuitive approach about tangent curves reveals what we think of what it means to be tangent it is almost chanceless the deal with it. The probably best approach -for now at least- certainly is the one by derivations. Though it masks our association of tangent space and derivative it is the one covering its algebraic properties. Surely, there's more approaches as the one by germs, however, most of them seem to fit inside one of these classes as variants as the diagram below could should suggest. If one compares the algebraic approach to the analogeous problem of tensor products it might be the suggested starting point for a universal property of the tangent space. (Despite this, there's already the universal property given by Spivak in his works appendix. That, however, seems way to technical, giving rise to clarifications.) So my hope: Does somebody know how to work out the universal property of tangent spaces or is somebody familiar enough with Spivak's comprehensive introduction to differential geometry so to clarify his elaboration?","['differential-geometry', 'universal-property']"

  $B$ can obviously achieve success with probability $\frac12$ by flipping a coin, and it seems impossible that she could do better. However, there is a strategy $B$ can follow that is guaranteed to  produce a correct prediction with probability strictly greater than $\frac12$. The strategy, in short, is: Prior to selecting the slip, $B$ should select some probability distribution $D$ on $\Bbb R$ that is everywhere positive.  A normal distribution will suffice. $B$ should generate a random number $y\in \Bbb R$ distributed according to $D$. Let $x$ be the number on the slip selected by $B$.  If $x>y$, then $B$ predicts that $x$ is the larger of the two numbers; if $x<y$ she predicts that $x$ is the smaller of the two numbers. ($y=x$ occurs with probability $0$ and can be disregarded.) I omit the analysis that shows that this method predicts correctly with probability strictly greater than $\frac12$; the details are in the other post.

Let $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times 1}$ be a given non-zero (column) vector. Write a (possibly efficient) algorithm to construct a matrix $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K-1}$ such as that:
$(1)$ the column-vectors of $\mathbf{B}$ are orthogonal to each other; $(2)$ $\mathbf{B^T v} = \mathbf{0}$, where $^T$ denotes transpose and $\mathbf{0}$ a ((K-1)-dimensional) vector of all zeros. Denoting with $\mathbf{b}_i$, $i=1,\dots,K-1$, the $i$-th column of $\mathbf{B}$, the first requirement can be rewritten as: $\mathbf{b}_i^T \mathbf{b}_j = 0$ for $i \neq j$. Essentially, the problem asks to write an algorithm to find an orthogonal basis to the orthogonal complement of the (mono-dimensional) space spanned by $\mathbf{v}$. The algorithm can be written in pseudo-code (or in MATLAB-like or in C-like code). The algorithm takes in input the vector $\mathbf{v}$ and the integer $K$; its output is the matrix $\mathbf{B}$. Note: the algorithm cannot do a ""random trial-and-error"", i.e., generate a random vector, try if it is orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}$ and to the previously found columns of $\mathbf{B}$, discard if it not, memorize it if it is. This is an explicitly forbidden brute-force approach. However, it is indeed allowed to do this as an initializing stage, i.e., for the first column of the matrix or as a ""random guess"" at the start, if any need to do so should arise. ""Normality"", i.e., finding an orthonormal basis, is not required. Input checking (e.g. checking if $K$ is an even integer) is not required. EDIT: My thoughts and previous attempts: The problem is essentially an implementation of Gram-Schmidts orthonormalization process. However, it cannot simply be used as stated, because Gram-Schimdts' theorem assumes to start with a basis (which we do not have). What we can actually construct is a spanning set of vectors, i.e. $\mathbf{v}, e_1, \dots, e_K$, where $e_i$ denotes the $i$-th canonical base vector. I have already implemented Gram-Schmidts, paying attention to numerical issues. The problem is a slight generalization of the process, in which you do not start with a basis, but with a spanning set, find a suitable basis in the set (I don't know how to do it), which must contain $\mathbf{v}$ as its first element, and then apply Gram-Schimdts process.

By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, this tells us that $|G:G_{Ha}|=2m$ for any $Ha \in G/H$ ($G_{Ha}$ is the stabilizer of $Ha$ in $G$).  I have been racking my brain trying to find a way to show that $t$ fixes some $Ha$, because then $Ha \cdot t = Hat = Ha$, and it follows that $Hata^{-1}=H$ and $ata^{-1} \in H$, giving the desired result. I'm not sure how to use the assumptions that $G$ is simple and $|G:H|=2m$.  What I can say is that the kernel of the action of $G$ on $H$ must be trivial.  Already I mentioned that $|G:H|=2m$ gives us the size of the single orbit is $2m$, and this says that the $|G:G_{Ha}|=2m$ for each $Ha$.  I'm not sure what the significance of $m$ being odd is, because G/H is only a set and not a group (in this case).  I haven't managed to deduce any useful group properties from it, either. Another possibility is to show that $|H|$ is divisible by $2$.  Then $H$ contains an involution which is contained in some Sylow $2$-subgroup of $G$, and all of these (there must be more than one since $G$ is simple) are conjugate, so I think this may give us what we need. Again, I'd appreciate a hint (only) on how to proceed.  Thanks.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'simple-groups']"

Now we just covered the inverse function theorem and implicit function theorem for multi-variable vector-valued functions.

The Proof is quite easy : the sub set of the real numbers defined by a finite number of steps is countable. But R is not. For example : x = 0.10110111011110111110111111 ... is easy to mention for the decimal sequence that defines it is the result of a simple process. For many other numbers, there is no finite process to define them. Let us consider Rf the subset of R made of ""mentionable"" numbers (defined by a finite number of words.) Rf is stable for addition , multiplication , etc ... 
if a and b are mentionable a + b is mentionable. So Rf has interesting algebraical properties. It is not a closed subset : a sequence of mentionable numbers might not be mentionable itself : For example if x is a non-mentionable number, the sequence of its decimal approximations (1 , 1.2 , 1.25 , 1.258 , ...) is made of mentionable numbers but can not be mentioned (if it was, x could be defined as the limit of this sequence and would be mentionable itself.) This can be done for many other structures. The algebraic stability of the mentionable subset lets me think that some interesting results exist. (mentionable fields like Rf, lead to vector spaces, etc ...) may be there is somewhere a little theory about this all. I guess I am not the first one to think about this. :o) This Rf subset of R is surely well known and has a proper name.

The size of my input set is HUGE and evaluating the function is rather costly. However, I can think of this statistically by viewing the set of values generated by applying the function to each input value as a population . I would like to study this population statistically by evaluating a ( relatively ) small subset of the input values and using that information to infer a plausible range for the total number of times it would have evaluated true had I actually evaluated each input. Therefore, I chose to conceptualize this as inferring the total number of 1's in a very long binary string via Monte Carlo. This conceptualization contains all the salient features of my problem. Problem Statement Given a long (but finite) binary string, $S$ with $n_S\gg 2^{20}$  I would like to use a Monte Carlo sampling approach to estimate the number of 1's in S. Probabilistically, if I let each digit in S have an equal chance of being selected by the Monte Carlo sampler, then the digits in S can be thought of as a outcomes of a random variable. Therefor, the goal is to estimate $\mu = E[x\in S]$ via Monte Carlo. Since we know the size of S, our estimate of the number of 1's in S will be $\mu n_S$. However, there is no explicit formula for calculating $\mu$ apart from brute force enumeration. For very large sets, enumeration is not possible and the basic/naive Monte Carlo approach is very inefficient. I was thinking that some form of adaptive stratification would be helpful, with adaptation based on the sample average of each strata. Any suggestions or references to relevant literature would be helpful.","['statistics', 'expectation', 'monte-carlo', 'sampling', 'probability']"

The marking scheme is $+4$ for correct answer, $-1$ for wrong answer and $0$ marks for question not attempted. There are $4$ options for each question. A student can attempt any number of questions he wants. How many different marks are possible? Obviously minimum marks are $-100$. Working from $400$, the possible marks can be guessed till we see intuitively that all marks less than it are possible. But this approach is long. I want a more general and short approach which would be short even if the marking pattern was $+5,-2,0$.","['analysis', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"
710899,Prym variety associated to an étale cover of degree 2 of an hyperelliptic curve.,"In view of this question , I have an additional question. The situation is as follows. Let $C$ be the hyperelliptic curve over $\mathbb{C}$, which is given on an affine by the equation $y^2 = x^5 +1 = \prod_{i=1}^{5} (x-\alpha_{i})$. Etale Galois covers of $C$ with group the cyclic group of order 2, are in bijection with the 2-torsion points of the Jacobian $J(C)$ of $C$, see Hartshorne exercise 2.7 of Chpt. 4. The difference between two Weierstrass-points gives rise to a 2-torsion point on the Jacobian, see also question . Indeed, for example the function $z^{2} - \frac{(x-\alpha_{1})}{(x-\alpha_{2})} \in K[z]$, where $K$ is the function field of $C$, defines a quadratic extension of the function field $K$, which gives an etale cover of degree 2 of $C$, which we will denote by $f: C' \rightarrow C$. This gives the so-called norm map on Jacobians $f_{*}: J(C') \rightarrow J(C)$. If I understand it correctly, the Prym variety $P$ with respect to $f$ then is defined to be the connected component of the identity of the kernel of $f_{*}$. My question is: what is the Prym variety $P$ in this case? Due to the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, I believe that $P$ must be 1-dimensional. I am actually not even sure what exactly the map $f$ is.

710949,Non-radical ideal giving the empty set.,"Let $R$ be the polynomial ring of $n$ variables over $\mathbb C$. 
It is known that a radical ideal $I (\ne R)$ defines a non-empty set $\mathbf V(I) \subset \mathbb C^n$. I am looking for a counterexample. Can we have a non-radical ideal $I (\ne R)$ such that $\mathbf V(I)=\varnothing$?","['ideals', 'algebraic-geometry']"
710992,Sum of squares function usually larger than $(\log x)^{1/2 - \epsilon}$?,"Let $r_2(n)$ be the sum of squares function, i.e. the number of different pairs $a,b\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = n$. Let $R$ be the set of representable integers, i.e. the subset of $\mathbb{N}$ such that $r_2(n) > 0$. I would like to know whether or not the following is true: Fix $0 < \epsilon < 1/2$. Given large $x$, almost all $n \le x$ in $R$ satisfy $r_2(n) \ge (\log x)^{1/2 - \epsilon}$. If this is hard/wrong, then I would also be happy with the following much weaker fact: There is a function $f(x)$ that goes to $\infty$ when $x \to \infty$ such that almost all $n \le x$ in $R$ satisfy $r_2(n) \ge f(x)$. Explanation for the ""almost all"": Landau's theorem says the amount of $n \in R$, $n \le x$ is asymptotically $\displaystyle \frac {bx}{\sqrt {\log x}}$ where $b$ is Landau's constant . So, I would like to know whether the number of exceptions to $r_2(n) \ge (\log x)^{1/2 - \epsilon}$ for $n\in R, n\le x$ is asymptotically negligible, i.e. $\displaystyle o\left(\frac x {\sqrt \log x}\right)$. My thoughts on the problem: By Gauss's solution of the circle problem we know that $\displaystyle \sum_{n\le x} r_2(n) \sim \pi x$. From this and Landau's theorem we know that the average value of $r_2(n)$ for $n \le x$, $n \in R$ is $\frac \pi b \sqrt {\log x}$. So this is the average value of $r_2(n)$ on $R, n\le x$. By applying a sort of ""Markov's inequality"" we get the reverse direction of what I want: Let $E(x)$ by the number of exceptions, i.e. the number of $n \le x$, $n \in R$ such that $r_2(n) > (\log x)^{1/2 + \epsilon}$. Then $$\pi x \sim \sum_{n \le x} r_2(n) \ge E(x) (\log x)^{1/2 + \epsilon}$$ This means $$E(x) = o\left(\frac x {\sqrt {\log x}}\right)$$ meaning that almost all $n \le x$, $n \in R$ satisfy $r_2(n) \le (\log x)^{1/2 + \epsilon}$. For the direction I'm interested this approach is not enough and we need a sort of ""Chebyshev inequality"". This means we want a sort of ""second moment"" of $r_2(n)$. I found it in this Math.StackExchange question : $\sum_{n \le x} r_2(n)^2 \sim ax \log x$ where $a$ is a constant. Unfortunately, this asymptotic is too poor, and when trying to use the above method on $\left|r_2(n) - \frac \pi b \sqrt{\log x}\right|$, the error term squashes the main term and we get nothing.","['analytic-number-theory', 'number-theory']"
711010,About derangement problems,"Two derangement problems are really confusing me a lot.
Please help me. First Problem There are n people in the room and they are sitting on a round table.
  All of them went out the room and came back. When they are sitting on
  the same round table again, they are sitting in a certain way such
  that the person sitting on their right side is not the same person as
  before. How many ways are there to sit in this way? To me, it sounded like Menage problem at first but found out that this is not the same problem. At first, I thought there would be $D_n$ number of ways to sit them in the way the problem asks for. But I thought that since they are sitting on a round table, any rotations of a sitting will be counted as one case. So, I changed it to $D_{n-1}$ ways. Am I on the right track? Second Problem There are $n$ pair of pieces for a necklace. For each pair, they have the same color but different letters are written on the pieces. How many ways are there to make the necklace such that any adjacent two pieces do not have the same color? For this one, it really confuses me, but sounds really similar to the non-sexist Menage problem. How should I tackle with it? Thank you!","['derangements', 'combinatorics']"
711012,Integer valued polynomials in two variables,"The ring of integer valued polynomials, $\{ f \in \mathbb{Q}[x] : f(\mathbb{Z}) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$ is fairly well-known to be generated as Abelian group by the binomial coefficients, $f_k(n) = \binom{n}{k}$ of degree $k$. What about the corresponding two-variable ring, $\{ f \in \mathbb{Q}[x,y] : f(\mathbb{Z}^2) \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \}$? Does it have a nice generating set? Multinomial coefficients are usually $\binom{n}{i,j}$ which would still be a single variable polynomial (the $i$ and the $j$ would affect the denominator). Nothing else came to mind. Also, I guess I probably want the generators to satisfy $f(\omega^2) \subseteq \omega$ where $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\} \subset \mathbb{Z}$, which just works out for the binomial coefficients. If that is impossible, that would also be useful knowledge, since theoretically these count things.","['integer-valued-polynomials', 'polynomials', 'binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"
