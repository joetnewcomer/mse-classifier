422356,An operator that commutes with another operator $T$ with distinct characteristic values is a polynomial in $T$,"I'm trying to solve some problems in Hoffman and Kunze and I'm kind of stuck on this one. This is 6.5.3 on Hoffman and Kunze. Here is the question: Let $T$ be a a linear operator on an $n$-dimensional space, and suppose that $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values. Prove that any linear operator $U$ which commutes with $T$ is a polynomial in $T$. My work so far: Since $T$ has $n$ distinct characteristic values and since the space it acts on is also $n$ dimensional, $T$ must be diagonalisable. Now using the fact $UT=TU$ I can show that $U$ must also be diagonalizable. So these two operators must be simultaneously diagonalizable. Now I'm stuck with where this is going. I'm thinking of simultaneous diagonalizability because this is section 6.5 of Hoffman and Kunze and it deals with simultaneous diagonalizability. Am I on the right track with this?. Can anybody help? Thanks so much for your time and your answers.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'diagonalization']"

422392,Differentiability of a function at a point to prove it differentiable everywhere on the given condition.,"A simple question which I came across recently. Just wanted to confirm if my logic on it is right.... Suppose $f(x)$ is a function and it's given that it's differentiable everywhere except possibly at $0$, but for the point ""$0$"", it's given that $\lim_{x\to 0} f'(x) = 0.$ We need to prove that its differentiable everywhere. What I think is the left hand derivative will be equal to $\lim_{x\to 0^-} f'(x) = 0$ and similarly right hand derivative will be equal to $0$ too on similar lines. Is this right? I thought of the question myself as I was working on some other question and this bumped in my head. Can we do it this way or there should be some more condition given in the question to work our proof? Thanks.","['calculus', 'functions']"
422401,A question about Baby Rudin Theorem 2.27 (a),"Theorem 2.27: If $X$ is a metric space and $E \subset X$, then $\bar E$ (the closure of $E$) 
is closed. The proof says: If $p \in X$ and $p \not \in \bar E$ then $p$ is neither a point of $E$ nor a limit point of $E$. Hence $p$ has a neighborhood which does not intersect $E$. The complement of $\bar E$ is therefore open. Hence $\bar E$ is closed. I'm particularly questioning about ''Hence $p$ has a neighborhood which does not intersect $E$. The complement of $\bar E$ is therefore open.'' Should we also prove that the neighborhood of $p$ also does not intersect $E'$ (the set of all limit points of $E$)? Here's what I tried to prove, by contrapositive: ''For any $p \in {\bar E}^c$, if $N_r(p) \cap E' \ne \emptyset$ then $N_r(p) \cap E \ne \emptyset$''. Proof: For any $p \in {\bar E}^c$, if $N_r(p) \cap E' \ne \emptyset$, then take $q \in N_r(p) \cap E'$, $\exists N_h(q)$ s.t. $N_h(q) \subset N_r(p)$. Since $q \in E'$ is a limit point, $N_h(q) \cap E \ne \emptyset$, and hence $N_r(p) \cap E \ne \emptyset$. I'm not quite sure whether this is necessary. Or is there anything I missed from Rudin's proof?",['real-analysis']

422411,"Proof of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, why does this work?","My books says to prove that the following inequality is true, and to use it to prove Cauchy-Schwarz: $$(a_1x+b_1)^2+(a_2x+b_2)^2+(a_3x+b_3)^2+\dots+(a_nx+b_n)^2 \ge 0$$ This is easy to prove because by the trivial inequality each term on the LHS is $\ge 0$. However, to prove Cauchy-Schwarz using this this book gives the hint: Write the left side as a quadratic equation in $x$ and note that a quadratic equation is non negative for all $x$ if and only if the discriminant is non positive. If you multiply this out and set the discriminant $\le 0$, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality follows very straightforwardly. My question is: If there were no restrictions on $a$, $b$, or $x$ before I multiplied it out, why are there restrictions on them now? I know that before I was considering a series of quadratics and now I'm considering one giant one, but still it's the same inequality as before.","['inequality', 'algebra-precalculus']"
422419,"Where can I find good exercises for algebraic geometry that require hard, concrete computation?","I've been studying scheme theory from Hartshorne and Qing Liu for a few months now. (For those who are not big fans of Hartshorne, I have to note that I agree with you: I use it only for exercises.) I now have a basic understanding of concepts like separatedness and properness, and quasicoherent sheaves, although I haven't gotten to cohomology quite yet. I do all the exercises that don't seem totally trivial (and there are indeed a few of those, in both textbooks). I do feel like this has given me a good solid understanding of the material, but I also note that it's a bit one-sided. All the exercises in both texts are pretty abstract. I do what I think makes the most of them: for each exercise, I tend to write 5-10 page solutions which carefully develop machinery to makes the problem trivial, and this has been great practice for the broad realities of research. Typically a term will come to mind that I've heard but never studied and which seems applicable, and I'll develop that concept (or what I think that concept ought to be) until it solves my problem. At risk of repeating it too much, I'm really happy with certain aspects of what I've gotten out of this, but it's also clearly a very impoverished approach: one unfortunate result is that I rarely get to sit down with a real scheme and do some real computation and explore a real example. I'm becoming increasingly aware of the fact that if I were faced with such a situation, I wouldn't know where to begin. So here's my question. Hartshorne and Qing Liu have essentially the same issue. I've also used Vakil's FOAG, which is markedly better, but still a bit weak in that department. Where can I find a collection of exercises in algebraic geometry and schemes that will force me to get my hands dirty with some real schemes, and really compute something?","['algebraic-geometry', 'reference-request']"

$$\implies \sum_j (\delta_{ij}\delta_{ij}+2\theta_{ij}\delta_{ij}+O(\theta^2))=1$$ As you can easily see my calculations are going nowhere.","['symmetry', 'lie-algebras', 'group-theory']"
422428,"Does there exist $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$?","Recently the following question was posed: does there exist a differentiable bijection $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$ ? (Here, $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$ with respect to composition of functions.) The answer, as it turns out, is negative, because such a bijection is monotonic, which implies that the derivative cannot be bijective. There seem to be no such problems if we instead search for a bijection $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$ , so the following variation of the question seems interesting: Does there exist a differentiable bijection $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'=f^{-1}$ ? ( Edit: as mentioned at the end of this question, the question of existence has been resolved. Is the solution unique?) Here's the first idea: if there is a function $f:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ such that $f'(x)=f^{-1}(x)$ holds for all $x\in(0,\infty)$ , then $$f'(f(x))=f^{-1}(f(x))=x$$ also must hold for all $x$ , since $f$ is bijective. This immediately reminds us of the chain rule, so we multiply by $f'(x)$ to yield $$f'(f(x))f'(x)=xf'(x)$$ which is equivalent to $$f'(f(x))f'(x)=xf'(x)+f(x)-f(x).$$ This implies (integrate from $1$ to $x$ , for instance) that there is a primitive function $F$ of $f$ such that $$f(f(x)) = x f(x) - F(x)$$ holds for all $x\in(0,\infty)$ , so we may try solving this equation instead. I don't know if this is any easier than the original problem, though. Maybe some kind of fixed point principle might work to show existence? It would be very nice if it turns out that there is a nice characterization of such functions. Edit: At the link pointed out by Christian Blatter in the comments there is an explicit solution ( $f(x)=\frac{x^\phi}{\phi^{\phi-1}}$ , where $\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$ is the golden ratio), so maybe it would also be interesting to know: Is this solution unique?",['analysis']

where $k \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}}$. One can somehow simplify the equation and write it as:
$$\phi'+\frac{b^2 \left(1-e^{l^2}+l^2\right)+l^2 \left(-2+2 e^{l^2}+l^2\right)}{\left(-1+e^{l^2}\right)\left(b^2+l^2\right)l}\phi= k \frac{l^2 \left(1-2 b^2-2 l^2\right)}{\left(-1+e^{l^2}\right) \left(b^2+l^2\right)^2}.$$ Writting the above as $\phi'+h(l)\phi=g(l)$ the solution is given by:
$$\phi(l) = e^{-\int_1^l h(\xi) d\xi}  \int_1^l g(\zeta)~e^{\int_1^\zeta h(\xi) d\xi} d\zeta+C_1 e^{ -\int_1^l h(\xi) d\xi},$$ where $C_1$ is an integration constant. The problem is in solving that big integral in the previous expression. I can't solve it and Mathematica tells me that it can't be put in terms of standard math functions.
I was then hoping that somebody could help me find an approximate solution maybe using the method of matched asymptotic expansions since I know that $ \phi(l)=O(1/l^2)$ as $l \to \infty$. I also know from symmetry that $\phi(0)=0$.

422486,Prove that one of the following sets is a subspace and the other isn't?,"OK, here goes another. 
Prove that $ W_1 = ${$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \in F^n : a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 0$} is a subspace of $F^n$ but $ W_2 = ${$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \in F^n : a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 1$} is not. OK. Any subspace has to contain the zero vector, be closed under addition and scalar multiplication by definition. So to prove this we first see whether the set $W_1$ meet those criteria. Plugging in 0 for $a_i$ obviously works, so the first condition is met. Is it closed under addition? let $b_i$ be the components of an arbitrary vector in $W_1$. So ($b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) \in W_1$ and if we add it to $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ we get $(a_1 + b_1) + (a_2 + b_2) + \cdots +(a_n + b_n) = 0$. That's pretty clearly part of $W_1$ and thus closed under addition. Next we see if it is closed under multiplication by a scalar. We pick an arbitrary scalar $c$ and multiply it by $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ to get $(ca_1, ca_2, \ldots, ca_n)$ and plugging that into the original condition we find that it doesn't matter what c is, because $ca_1 + ca_2 + \cdots + ca_n = 0$ and that's still in $W_1.$ Therefore $W_1$ is a subspace of $F^n$. If we do the same procedure with $W_2$, though, we find that $0$ vector is not in the set. Because $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n = 1$ is a contradiction. Further, we can see that it isn't closed under multiplication either. $ca_1 + ca_2 + \cdots + ca_n = c$ and that will only equal 1 if c=1, so the equation does not hold with an arbitrary $c$. Therefore $W_2$ is NOT a subspace of $F^n$. Any holes in this proof?

422534,Proving replacement theorem?,"I want to see if I am understanding the proof of the replacement theorem correctly. Let $V$ be a vector space that is spanned by a set $G$ containing $n$ vectors. 
Let $L \subseteq V$ be a linearly independent subset containing $m$ vectors. 
Then $m\leq n$ and there exists a subset H of G containing exactly $n-m$ vectors s.t. $L \cup H$ generates $V$. The proof in the book says to start with $m=0$. In that case $L=\varnothing$, the empty set. Let's assume this theorem is true for some integer $m \geq 0$. Let $L = \{v_j\}_{j=1}^{m+1}$ and define it as a linearly independent subset of $V$ consisting of $m+1$ vectors. Since any subset of a linearly independent set is linearly independent as well ($S_1 \subseteq S_2 \subseteq V$), then $\{v_j\}_{j=1}^m$ is linearly independent also. It then says to use the induction hypothesis to say that $m \geq n$. Well, ok, but that seems sort of pulled out of nowhere to me. The next step is to say that there is therefore another subset, $\{u_k\}_{k=1}^{n-m}$ of G such that $\{v_j\}_{j=1}^m \cup \{u_k\}_{k=1}^{n-m}$ spans $V$. That being the case there are scalars $(a_j)_{j=1}^m$ and $(b_k)_{k=1}^{n-m}$ which you can multiply by the vectors $v_j$ and $u_k$. You can then add the two sets of vectors, yielding $$\sum_{j=1}^m a_j v_j + \sum_{k=1}^{n-m} b_k u_k = v_{m+1}$$ At this point I am not sure I understand things. Because we are assuming $n-m>0$ -- otherwise $v_{m+1}$ is linearly dependent. But then it says not only is $n>m $ but $n>m+1$, and that is where I am losing the plot to get to the next step.","['vector-spaces', 'linear-algebra']"

A little bit of algebra leads to $m+1>u$. $m+1$ is in $\mathbb N$ and $m+1>u=\sup(\mathbb N)$ thus we have a contradiction. Can anyone help clear up these implications that I'm not really comfortable with?  Thanks!",['real-analysis']

I know that the usual method is to perform an eigenvalue decomposition, zero out the negative eigenvalues, and recompute the eigenvalue decomposition. However, I don't want to do any eigenvalue decompositions, and I want to deal with this issue within the Cholesky algorithm. For those of you who are familiar with the Cholesky algorithm, there is a step where you compute the diagonal of the lower diagonal matrix as the square root of a value (let's say x). If x<0 then, this means the matrix is NPD. A simple way to deal with this could be to set x = 0 or x = 10^-10, just to work around this problem. However, it lacks the mathematical rigor. My question is, has any of you heard such a method, or something similar to the above method, which is either published or somewhat proven?","['cholesky-decomposition', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'reference-request', 'diagonalization']"

Basically, in the initial phase,students assume that integration and differentiation are always associated to each other, i.e., a function which is integrable is also differentiable at the same time. But having explored on it more, i found out its not true at all and does not hold always. Many a times (or should i say infinitely times) a function can be integrable on an interval while its not differentiable on that same interval (and vice versa) . What i want to ask is this : i recently read a conclusion on the above mentioned concept which is : {Differentiable functions} $\subset$ {Continuous functions} $\subset$ {Integrable functions} i.e., each is a proper subset of the next. Now, ""Differentiable functions set"" is a proper subset of ""Continuous functions set""... that is very well understood without a doubt as every continuous function may or may not be differentiable. I have problem with the next relation which is : $\\\\$ ""Continuous functions set"" is a proper subset of ""Integrable functions set""...Why is this so??? $\\\\$ I am just not able to visualize this. I know that a bounded continuous function on a closed interval is integrable, well and fine, but there are unbounded continuous functions too with domain R , which we cant say will be integrable or not.

I know you need to follow these steps: Find out $f'(x)$. Find out the values for which $f'(x)=0$. In other words, we need to find out the zeroes of $f'(x)$. Let's suppose we find out two values which are $x=a$ and $x=b$, and that $a<b$. Now we need to choose a random value $r$ from the interval $(-\infty,a]$ or $(-\infty,a)$ (I don't remember exactly) and calculate $f'(x)$ for $x=r$. If $f'(x)<0$ for $x=r$, then $f(x)$ is decreasing in the mentioned interval. If $f'(x)=0$ for $x=r$, then $f(x)$ is constant in that interval. If $f'(x)>0$ for $x=r$, then $f(x)$ is increasing in that interval. We need to repeat steps 3 and 4 for the other intervals. Now, what happens if $f'(x)$ doesn't have any zeroes? What should I do?

423187,Help with generating functions.,"Background. Let $P_0(y)=2y-3$ and define recursively $$P_{n+1}(y)=4y\cdot P_n'(y)+(5-4y)\cdot P_n(y).$$ I would like to know as many properties of $P_n$ as I can. For example, it can be shown that each $P_n$ has only real simple positive zeros and that $P_n$ and $P_{n+1}$ strictly interlace for every $n$. It can also be shown that the recursive strict Turan Inequality is satisfied, for $y>0$, $$T_n(y):=P_{n+1}(y)^2-P_n(y)\cdot P_{n+2}(y)>0.$$ Empirical evidence (Mathematica) indicates that $T_n(y)$ is an increasing polynomial with only one real zero at $0$. My goal is to find a good estimate of $T_n(\pi)$ and show that $T_n(y)>T_n(\pi)$ for $y>\pi$. In an effort to establish that goal it would be nice to find a generating function for the $\{P_n\}$. Problem. In an attempt to find such generating function I have made a terrible error, but I can't seem to find what my error is. Please show me the error of my ways. Define the formal power series, $$f(y,t):= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P_n(y)}{n!}t^n.$$ we see then that $$f_t=\frac{d}{dt}f(y,t)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{P_n(y)}{(n-1)!}t^{n-1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P_{n+1}(y)}{n!}t^n.$$ Using the differential equation above we have, $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P_{n+1}(y)}{n!}t^n=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4y\cdot P_n'(y)+(5-4y)\cdot P_n(y)}{n!}t^n.$$ So we arrive at $$f_t=4y\cdot f_y+(5-4y)\cdot f.$$ A quick check verifies that $f(y,t)=e^{5t+y}$. And so we have the generating function $$e^{5t+y}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P_n(y)}{n!}t^n,$$ but this implies, differentiate with respect to $y$, that $$e^{5t+y}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{P'_n(y)}{n!}t^n,$$ and so $$P_n(y)=P'_n(y)$$ for every $n$ and $y$. How can that be? $\{P_n\}$ is a sequence of polynomials???

In the first cut, the apple is divided in two pieces: a small one that drops into the plate and a big one that is still hold with the hand. This big piece is again divided in two pieces, a small one that falls into the plate and a big one that is held in the hand. We continue doing cuts until we hold a small piece with the hand that we just drop into the plate. We don’t want to take a dropped piece from the plate to recut it. We generate a definitive piece with each cut, except for the last cut that we generate two pieces. The objective is to generate $N$ pieces from the apple so that they are most close to a sphere of volume $\dfrac{V}{N}$ where $V$ is the volume of the whole apple. Mathematically, we can approximate an apple with a sphere, and I would like to minimize the error function compared with the perfect solution. In other words, for every small (differential) piece of volume that is outside of the sphere of volume $\dfrac{V}{N}$ and radius $a$ and for every piece of volume inside this sphere that it’s not filled, we calculate: $$e= (r-a)^2$$ where $r$ is the distance of the small volume to the centre of the sphere. We then add (integrate) all errors of all the small volumes of all the pieces that we generated. This result is the value that we want to minimize. The question is, what’s the best approach to cut the sphere (apple) in order to minimize the error function (in order to be more palatable)?","['geometry', 'algorithms', 'numerical-methods']"

Since the series in question is the sum of as $j$ ranges from $1$ to $k$ of the series $f_j(z) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_j^n z^n$ you see right away that the radius of convergence $R$ of $f(z)$ is at least $\displaystyle 1$. I'm guessing that maybe the radius of convergence $R$ is exactly $\displaystyle 1$. 
I think you might be able to get the answer if you can show that the set $\{a_1^n + \dots + a_k^n : n \ge 0\}$ either has a non-zero limit point inside $\{ z : |z| \le k \}$, or else attains the same non-zero value infinitely many times, because then in either case you can find a subsequence $\{n_j\}$ with $|a_1^{n_j} + \dots + a_k^{n_j}|$ bounded away from $0$, and so $|a_1^{n_j} + \dots + a_k^{n_j}|^{1/n_j} \to 1$ as $n_j \to \infty$. Any thoughts about how to proceed with this idea? Or, is there a far better way to look at this? Edit (*) For $a_j$ and any $N > 0$, you can find a $n > N$ such that $a_j^n$ is arbitrarily close to $1$. You can do this by writing $a_j^n = e^{i n \theta_j}$ and looking at $n \theta _j$ modulo $2 \pi$. Let $b_i = a_i / a_1$. It is not true that we have any of the limits $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}a_1^n + a_2^n = 0, -1, -2, \dots$. This is because we can find a subsequence $\{n_k\}$ such that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}a_1^{n_k} = 1$. Assuming to the contrary for a contradiction, for this subsequence one would have to have $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} a_1^{n_k}(1 + b_2^{n_k}) = 0, -1, -2, \dots$ so that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} (1 + b_2^{n_k}) = 0, -1, -2, \dots$ and therefore $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} b_2^{n_k} = -1, -2, -3, \dots$ which is impossible by (*). Similarly, it is not true that we have any of the limits $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}a_1^n + a_2^n + a_3^n= 0, -1, -2, \dots$. Because otherwise, we can find a subsequence $\{n_k\}$ such that $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}a_1^{n_k} = 1$, and then $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} (1 + b_2^{n_k} + b_3^{n_k}) = 0, -1, -2, \dots$, and in this case $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} b_2^{n_k} + b_3^{n_k}= -1, -2, -3, \dots$ which is impossible. Continuing like this, we see that it is not true that we have any of the limits $\lim \limits_{n \to \infty}a_1^n + a_2^n + \dots + a_k^n= 0, -1, -2, \dots$.

423282,Normal Vector to a Sphere,"I'm having kind of a problem on calculating the normal vector to a sphere using a parameterization. Consider a unit-radius sphere centered at the origin. One can parameterize it using the following:
$$P(\phi, \theta)=(\sin(\phi)\cos(\theta),\,\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta),\,\cos(\phi)) $$ My Vector Calculus book says that the Vector Product between the two partial derivates of the parameterized surface gives a Normal Vector to the surface. I found that
$$\frac {\partial P(\phi, \theta)}{\partial \phi} \times \frac {\partial P(\phi, \theta)}{\partial \theta} = (\sin^2(\phi)\cos(\theta))\hat i + (\sin^2(\phi)\sin(\theta))\hat j + (\sin(\phi)\cos(\phi))\hat k$$ Which, as one can easily verify, yields $(0, 0,0)$ for $(\phi,\theta) = (0,0)$ which means that the sphere is not regular at the point $(0,0,1)$. That is obviously wrong, so I would like to know where is my mistake.",['multivariable-calculus']
423295,Chain of compact subsets and their intersection,"Let $\{X_n\}$ be a sequence of compact subsets of a metric space $M$ with $X_1\supset X_2\supset X_3\supset\dotsm$. Prove that if $U$ is an open set containing $\bigcap X_n$, then there exists $X_n\subset U$. So suppose for contradiction that there doesn't exist $X_n\subset U$, i.e. every $X_n$ has a part outside $U$. Since $\bigcap X_n$ is a subset of an open set $U$, every element of $\bigcap X_n$ has an open ball within $U$. To use compactness, I want to find an open cover for $X_n$. But I don't see any open cover to use... Edit : Okay, following the hint that someone posted (and deleted), I think I got it. Compact sets are closed, so $X_n$ is closed for all $n$, so $X_n'$ is open for all $n$ (where $'$ denotes complement.) Note that $X_n$ has an open cover consisting of $U,X_{n+1}',X_{n+2}',\ldots$ since $X_{n+1}'\cup X_{n+2}'\cup\ldots = (X_{n+1}\cap X_{n+2}\cap \ldots)' = (\bigcap X_i)'$. Since $X_n$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover $U,X_{a_1}',X_{a_2}',\ldots,X_{a_k}'$ where $a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k$. But this is a contradiction, since the part of $X_n$ which is the part of $X_{a_k}$ outside $U$ is not covered.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'compactness']"
423302,"How long does it take a person with this ""cheating"" data-gathering strategy to achieve a desired result?","I have a perfectly fair coin, and my goal is to prove that it is unfair with a confidence level of 95%.  In order to accomplish this, I will cheat .  Whenever I fail to have enough evidence, I will simply increase the sample size by continuing to flip the coin. To be specific, I will flip the coin until the proportion of heads is either small enough or large enough to be able to say that the coin is unfair.  Let's say that, for any given sample size $N$, there is at least a $95\%$ chance that the proportion of heads is within the confidence interval $$0.5 ± f(N)$$ where $f(N)$ is some function. If I have flipped the coin a grand total of $N$ times, and the proportion of heads is outside of this interval, then I ""conclude"" that the fair coin is unfair and stop the process.  If the proportion is within the interval, then I flip the coin one more time and repeat the process with $N+1$.  One important detail is that I never ""throw out"" data. What is the expected number of flips that I would have to make until I receive the ""statistically significant"" result I seek? I've run a few simulations with my calculator, and it seems that either it takes a reasonable number of flips (like 44) or it takes a huge amount of time.  Why is this, assuming it's not programmer error? Edit: More simulations I ran some more simulations (on an actual PC, rather than a calculator).  I used two criteria for determining whether or not a result is significant.  First, I required that there be at least $20$ flips performed. Second, I used this value for the function: $$f(N) = 1.9600 * \sqrt{\frac{0.5 * 0.5}N} = \frac{0.98}{\sqrt{N}}$$ More edits: this formula comes from the normal approximation for the binomial distribution, where $1.96$ is the required z-score and other part is the standard deviation of the proportion. My plan for running the simulations was to set an upper limit for the number of flips, preform a huge number of trials, and see what proportion of trials exceeded the limit.  This way, I could gather data in a reasonable time limit.  After running a large number of simulations, I acquired this data: # of flips      proportion > this number      sample size

423317,Find the Dirichlet inverse of the identity function,"I thought I got this one but now I'm having doubts. I have that if $f$ is a function such that $(f\ast\text{id})(n)=(\text{id}\ast f)(n)=\iota$ then $f$ is multiplicative since it is the inverse of a multiplicative function, and so it suffices to examine its values at prime factors. So letting $n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}$
  we require $$\left(f\ast\text{id}\right)(n)	=	\sum_{ab=n}f\left(a\right)b
	=	\sum_{i=1}^{k}f\left(p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}\right)\prod_{j\ne i}p_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}
	=	0
 $$ And since $\prod_{j\ne i}p_{j}^{\alpha_{j}}\ne0$
  for all $i$, we need $f\left(p_{i}^{\alpha_{i}}\right)=0$ for all primes $p_i$. Then for $n=1$ we require $\left(f\ast\text{id}\right)\left(1\right)	=	f(1)1
	=	1
 $ so $f(1)=1$. This implies that $f(n)=\cases{1 \ n=1 \\ 0 \ n\ne 1}$, or, in other words, $f=\iota$. But I am doubting this now, since $\iota$ is supposed to be the identity with respect to the Dirichlet convolution, so that $\iota\ast \text{id}$ should be $\text{id}$. But I can't see where I've made a mistake. Can anyone help?",['number-theory']
