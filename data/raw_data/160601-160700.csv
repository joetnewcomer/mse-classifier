2776748,Kernel of an étale self-map of an elliptic curve and the Galois group.,"This question originates from Hartshorne, Chapter IV, Problem 4.8. Fix some algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, and let $E \to \text{Spec }k$ be an elliptic curve. I want to compute the étale fundamental group $$\pi_1^{\text{ét}}(E) = \lim_{\leftarrow} \text{Gal}(K'/K),$$ where $K$ is the function field of $E$ and the limit runs over all Galois extensions of $K$ such that the corresponding curve $E'$ is étale over $E$. Hartshorne gives a long hint for this, and my question essentially comes from trying to justify everything in it. I can prove that any such étale map $f:E' \to E$ is dominated by the degree morphism $n_E:E\to E,$ where $n = \text{deg } f$. Further the degree morphism is also étale as it is unramified (the kernel has the same cardinality as its degree since we are in characteristic zero) and it is flat (its a finite surjective map of nonsingular varieties). So now it suffices to only consider the system given by the $n_E$, for each $n$. What I do not understand is how I am supposed to identify $\text{Gal}(K'/K)$ with $\text{Ker }n_E$. I believe this is true by analogy with covering spaces, but I do not see it explicitly in this context. Is there an easy (i.e. no étale-sites and such) explanation for this?","['elliptic-curves', 'algebraic-geometry']"

2776791,A finitely-generated ring over the integers modulo a max ideal is necessarily a finite field,"Suppose that you have a ring $\Lambda \subset \mathbf{C}$ such that $\Lambda$ is finitely generated over $\mathbf{Z}$. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $\Lambda$. Then the field $\Lambda / \mathfrak{m}$ must be finite. Serre uses this fact in his paper How to use Finite Fields for Problems Concerning Infinite Fields , and cites Bourbaki 1 for a proof. Since I lack a copy of Bourbaki, I figured I'd ask how to prove this here. I have a gut-feeling a proof shouldn't be too tough, but the fact that Serre decided to cite a source for this fact has me a bit worried. The only approach I've thought to try so far is to just write down an arbitrary finitely-generated ring over $\mathbf{Z}$ and figure out what a max ideal would have to look like in term of those generators, but maybe there's a slicker way.

2776803,Matrix projection onto positive semidefinite cone with respect to the spectral norm,"On page 399 of Boyd & Vandenberghe's Convex Optimization , it is stated that the projection of a symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $X_0$ onto the set of symmetric $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices $S^n_+$ is found in the following way: Find the spectral (eigenvalue) decomposition $$X_0 = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i v_i v_i^T$$ Define the projection $$X = \sum_{i=1}^n \max\{\lambda_i, 0\} v_i v_i^T$$ It is proven in the book that $X$ is the solution of the problem $$\underset{X}{\text{minimize}} \quad \| X - X_0 \|_F^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad X \succeq 0$$ where $\|A\|_F^2 = \operatorname{tr} \left(A^T A\right)$ is a square of the Frobenius norm. In other words, $X$ is the projection of $X_0$ onto symmetric positive semidefinite matrix cone with respect to the Frobenius norm. I have also found a proof of this in this question . Now the book also states (without a proof, or at least it is not obvious for me from the material) that $X$ is also a solution to the problem $$\underset{X}{\text{minimize}} \quad \| X - X_0 \|_2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad X \succeq 0$$ where $\|A\|_2$ ( $A$ being symmetric) is the spectral norm, $$\|A\|_2 = \max_{i=1, \dots, n}|\lambda_i| = \max\{\lambda_1, -\lambda_n\}$$ where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A$ , $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \dots \geq \lambda_n$ .

So here is the definition of convergence in distribution: We say that $(x^n) \in \mathbb{R}^q$ converges in distribution to $x \in \mathbb{R}^q$ if for the corresponding distribution functions $F_n$
and $F$, respectively, and for every continuity point $a \in \mathbb{R}^q$ of $F$, it holds that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
F_n(a) = F(a)$ . And  $C$ closed means that $C^c$ ( complement of $C$ ) is open. Maybe this could be helpful? Maybe we could show $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \inf \mathbb{P} (x^n \in O) \geq \mathbb{P}(x \in O) $ ( $O$ open set ) to verify the claim above. But how can I show it? And how can I use it to show $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sup \mathbb{P} (x^n \in C) \leq \mathbb{P}(x \in C) $ ? I know that $C$ is closed if and only if $C^c$ is open.

My assumption that $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \inf \mathbb{P} (x^n \in O) \geq \mathbb{P}(x \in O) $ ( $O$ open ) implies $ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sup \mathbb{P} (x^n \in C) \leq \mathbb{P}(x \in C) $.

2776841,The intuition of the dual space?,"The dual space of X is defined to be the space of all linear and continuous functionals that map X to R. But, What exactly is a dual space intuitively? In my current self-guided understanding, I think of a space of function as a set of points( or a region) in infinite dimensional space $\mathbb R^\infty$. Let $f(x)$ be a element of a space of functions $X$, can I think of each value $f(x)$ as the magnitude in the dimension $x$? If my assumption above is correct, then what does  it mean  to have a space consists of functionals?  Functionals take a function as input and spit out a scalar, right? There are many functionals that involve differentiation and are not continuous. These functionals in no sense correspond to any functions, right? Since all linear functionals that are bounded are also continuous, can I say that the only class of functionals that is linear and continuous is simple convolution with certain bounded function g(x)?  Namely, $\int f(x)g(x)dx$?
 And so, all g(x) that make the integral mapping continuous are the elements of the dual space? This is the best explanation I can come up with so far. If all my assumptions are incorrect, can someone explain to me what it means to have a space which consists of functionals?",['functional-analysis']

Also, wouldn't an extension by $a$ not include anything imaginary and therefore only half of the other roots.
I would almost definitely conclude that this extension is not normal, but part b of the question is to describe the Galois group $\operatorname{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(a)/\mathbb{Q})$ up to isomorphism, which would mean that the extension would have to be normal",['abstract-algebra']

2777057,Convergence to Uniform Distribution of a Random Walk on a Finite Group,"I am reading the paper Shuffling Cards and Stopping Times by P. Diaconis and D. Aldous (American Math. Monthly, 1986). Context. Let $G$ be a finite group and $Q$ be a probability distribution on $G$ .
We get a random walk on $G$ defined as follows: the probability of going from $x\in G$ to $gx\in G$ in one step is $Q(g)$ .
The $k$ -fold convolution of $Q$ , written $Q^{k^*}$ , is a probability distribution on $G$ defined as follows: $Q^{k^*}(g)$ is the probability of landing at $g$ at the $k$ -th step if we start at $e$ (identity) at the zeroth step. At the bottom of the second page of the paper (near equation 2.2), one reads: A fundamental result is that repeated convolutions converge to the uniform distribution $U$ : $$Q^{k^*}(g)\to U(g) \text{ as } k\to \infty$$ unless $Q$ is concentrated on some coset of some subgroup. (By "" $Q$ is concentrated on $X$ we mean $Q$ vanishes outside $X$ ""). I am trying to see why the above is true. I know the following result: If $\Sigma$ is the support of $Q$ , that is, $\Sigma=\{x\in G:\ Q(x)>0\}$ , then $\bullet$ The chain driven by $Q$ is irreducible if and only if $\Sigma$ generates $G$ . $\bullet$ Assuming $\Sigma$ generates $G$ , the random walk driven by $Q$ is aperiodic if and only if $\Sigma$ is not contained in a coset of a proper normal subgroup. So if $Q$ is not concentrated in some coset of some proper subgroup, then the chain driven by $Q$ is ergodic, and thus we have a unique stationary distribution. It's easy to check that the uniform distribution is stationary.
So the statement given in the aforementioned paper is proven in this direction. Question. I am unable to do the other direction. That is, if $Q$ is assumed to be concentrated on some coset of some proper (the authors didn't put proper in their writing) subgroup of $G$ , then the $k$ -fold convolution does not converge to $G$ . Further, the authors mention that Poincare has given a proof using Fourier analysis (Calcul Probabilites, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1912). I would really like to learn this proof, but I do not know French. If you know this proof, or any Fourier analytical proof, then I am very grateful if you cna share that.","['random-walk', 'markov-chains', 'probability-theory', 'group-theory']"

2777104,"Triebel-Lizorkin space $F_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $p=\infty$","One way to define the Triebel-Lizorkin space is using dyadic resolution of unity. Let $\psi$ be a Schwartz function which satisfies $\hat{\psi}(\xi)=1$ when $|\xi|\leq 1$ and $\hat{\psi}(\xi)=0$ when $|\xi|>\frac{3}{2}$. Define $\psi_0:=\psi$ and $\psi_j,j\in\mathbb{N}$ via
$$\widehat{\psi_j}(\xi)=\hat{\psi}(2^{-j}\xi)-\hat{\psi}(2^{-j+1}\xi).$$
Then we can see that $\widehat{\psi_j}$ is supported in the set
$$\{\xi\in\mathbb{R}^d: 2^{j-1}\leq|\xi|\leq 2^{j+1}\}.$$
Moreover:
$$\sum_{j=0}^\infty\widehat{\psi_j}(\xi)=1,\quad\forall \xi\in\mathbb{R}^d.$$
In this case we call $\psi$ a generating function, and $(\psi_j)_{j=0}^\infty$ a dyadic resolution of unity. Note that in this case every tempered distribution $f$ has the following representation
$$f=\sum_{j=0}^\infty\psi_j*f,$$
with the series converging in the space of tempered distributions. For $s\in\mathbb{R}$, $0<p<\infty$ and $0<q\leq\infty$, the Triebel-Lizorkin space $F_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is defined as the spaces of all tempered distribution $f$ such that
$$\|f\|_{F_{p,q}^s}:=\left\|\left(\sum_{j=0}^\infty 2^{jsq}|\psi_j*f|^q\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}\right\|_{L^p}<\infty$$
for $0<q<\infty$, and
$$\|f\|_{F_{p,\infty}^s}:=\left\|\sup_{j\in\mathbb{N}_0}2^{js}|\psi_j*f|\right\|_{L^p}<\infty.$$
By using technical arguments one can prove that dufferent dyadic resolutions of unity will give equivalent norms on the Triebel-Lizorking space. What I'm curious about is that, what happens if $p=\infty$? I've read several textbooks , e.g. ""Modern Fourier analysis"" by Loukas Grafakos, ""Theory of Funciton Spaces"" by Hans Triebel, in which $p=\infty$ is said to be a case where the above definition does not work. However the authors of those books didn't give more details on this issue. More specifically, my question is, why the above definition fails when $p=\infty$? Can anyone provide me some resources (links) which explains this issue in details? Or give me some key clues if possible?

Since continuous maps between compact Hausdorff spaces are closed, it is true if the preimage is $F_\sigma$, and this implies the same for $G_\delta$ by complementation.

The same answer can be derived, however, by using this shortcut (I am unaware if it has a specific name): $\lim \limits_{x \to \infty}\frac{3x^2+14x-5}{x^2+x-12}=\lim \limits_{x \to \infty}\frac{3x^2/x^2+14x/x^2-5/x^2}{x^2/x^2+x/x^2-12/x^2}$ Every term is divided by the highest degree of $x$ in the denominator.

I must show that the quotient $M:=X/\sim$ equipped with the quotient topology is a differentiable manifold. I understand that each equivalence class consists of two points: $[(x,y)]=\{(x,y);(1-x,-y)\}$, i.e. each pair of points corresponding to a reflection at $(\frac{1}{2},0)$. I first want to show that $M$ is indeed a topological manifold. It is non-empty and a topological space, as is evident. I want to prove that $M$ is hausdorff by showing that $M$ is homeomorphic to $M_{\geq0}:=[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$. The space $M_{\geq0}$ is itself hausdorff as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$, if we equip it with the subspace topology. We can construct the following map. $\rho:M\rightarrow M_{\geq0}; [(x,y)]\mapsto\begin{cases}(x,y),\quad y\geq0\\
(1-x,-y),\quad y<0\end{cases}$ It is injective: $\rho([(x,y)])=\rho([(u,v)])\Rightarrow (x,y)=(u,v)\vee(1-x,-y)=(1-u,-v)$, from which both follows that $(x,y)=(u,v)$. It is surjective: Let $x\in[0,1]$ and $y\in\mathbb{R}$. In the case $y\geq 0$, we obtain $\rho([(x,y)])=(x,y)\in[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}=M_{\geq0}$. In the case $y<0$, we obtain $\rho([(x,y)])=(1-x,-y)$, where $1-x\in[0,1]$ and $-y\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, hence $\rho([(x,y)])\in[0,1]\times\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}=M_{\geq0}$. Thus, in all we have $\rho(M)=M_{\geq0}$ and we have shown that $\rho$ is bijective. Now, how do I show that $\rho$ is continuous?

My attempt : assume there are finitely many irreducible monic polynomials $f_1, f_2, ..., f_n$. Then consider $p = 1 + f_1 f_2 ... f_n$, which is monic since all the $f_i$ are monic and $1$ is constant. By assumption, $p$ must be reducible, since it is not equal to any of the $f_i$. So there must exist some $g \in k[X]$ such that $g$ divides $f_1 f_2 ... f_n$ -- a contradiction since the $f_i$ are assumed to be irreducible.

I'm trying to work out in my head whether that's possible. Am I on the right track or just totally off? TIA!

2777604,Help with proof in Hartshorne concerning points in a product scheme being regular in codim 1,"So I've spent quite a lot of time trying to work this proof out myself and I'm getting nowhere. The proof is Proposition 6.6 in Chapter II of Hartshorne. Let $X$ be a noetherian, integral, separated scheme which is regular in codimension $1$. Let $\mathbb{A}^{1}$ denote $\text{Spec } \mathbb{Z}[t]$. The proof is to show that $X \times \mathbb{A}^{1}$ (with the product taken over $\text{Spec }\mathbb{Z}$) is noetherian, integral, separated, and regular in codimension $1$. The noetherian, integral, and separated parts are easy if you know some basic change-of-base results. My question is about the regular in codimension $1$ part of the proof. We can immediately reduce to the affine case. Let $X = \text{Spec }B$. Then the projection morphism takes the form
$$
\pi: \text{Spec } B[t] \longrightarrow \text{Spec }B
$$
corresponding to the inclusion of rings
$$
B \hookrightarrow B[t]
$$
If $p \in \text{Spec }B[t]$ is a point of codimension $1$, say it corresponds to a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset B[t]$ of height $1$. Hartshorne deduces that there are two cases: 1) $\pi(p)$ is a codimension $1$ point in $\text{Spec } B$; 2) $\pi(p)$ is the generic point of $\text{Spec } B$. So far I understand. But this is as far as I understand. He claims that in the first case, $p$ is the generic point of $\pi^{-1}(p)$. But why is $\pi^{-1}(y)$ even a closed set, let alone irreducible? Moreover, why is it then immediate that $\mathcal{O}_{p} \simeq \mathcal{O}_{\pi(p)}[t]_{\mathfrak{m}_{\pi(p)}}$ as he claims? He claims in the second case that the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{p}$ is a localization of $K[t]$ at some maximal ideal, where $K$ is the function field of $X$. This claim in itself was not clear to me, but I got an answer in another question here .","['divisors-algebraic-geometry', 'proof-explanation', 'algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

Base case $k=2$
$$F_{2-2}+F_{2-4}+...+F_{2\,mod \,2+2}=F_{2-1}-1$$

therefore,
$$F_{0}+F_{-2}+...+F_{0+2}=F_{1}-1$$
$$F_{0}+F_{-2}+...+F_{2}=F_{1}-1$$
As $F_{0}=0,\,F_{-2}=-1,\,F_{2}=1,\,and\,F_{1}=1\,$therefore,
$$0+(-1)+...+1=1-1$$
$$0-1+...+1=1-1$$
$$0=0 \\ which\,\,is\,\,true\,\,the\,\,left\,\,hand\,\,side\,\,is\,\,zero\,\,when\,\,k\,\,is\,\,2.$$

Twelve fair dice are tossed independently and at least two “6”s appear. Eighteen fair dice are tossed independently and at least three “6”s appear.

but Newton correctly concluded that outcome A actually has the highest
probability. I know how A has highest probability mathematically. But it feels kind of unintuitive to me. Newton's explanation from Wikipedia Although Newton correctly calculated the odds of each bet, he provided
a separate intuitive explanation to Pepys. He imagined that B and C
toss their dice in groups of six, and said that A was most favorable
because it required a 6 in only one toss, while B and C required a 6
in each of their tosses. This explanation assumes that a group does
not produce more than one 6, so it does not actually correspond to the

2777884,comparison between valuation ring and proper morphism,"I came up with one question while trying to solve an exercise in algebraic geometry. Let $A$ be a local ring with maximal ideal $m$, a prime ideal $p$, and the fraction field $K$. There is a valuation ring $R$ which dominates $A$ (and maximal with domination). Since $A_p$ is also a local ring, there is a valuation ring $R'$ which dominates $A_p$. Now my question is, can we show that the ring R is contained in R' as the ring $A$ is contained in $A_p$?
In the original context, $A$ is a finitely generated algebra over a field $k$. Let me explain a little bit why I'm concerning this problem.
It's from Ex. 4.5 (c) of algebraic geometry by Hartshorne. Let $X$ be an integral scheme of finite type over a field $k$ with function field $K$. Suppose, for any valuation of $K/k$, there exists a unique center $x$ of $X$, i.e. there exists a unique point $x$ of $X$ with the domination between local ring $\mathcal{O}_{x,X}$. Then $X$ is proper over $k$. The given hyphothesis says that the valuative criterion for properness hold for a function field $K$ and its valuation ring $R$. However, to show the properness, we should consider other field $L$ and its valuation ring $S$. A map from $\mathrm{Spec}L$ to $X$ factor through a closed subscheme $\{x_0\}^-$ with a reduced induced structure where $x_0$ is the image of the $\xi_0 \in \mathrm{Spec}L$. Then we should find a map from $\mathrm{Spec}S$ for a valuation ring $S$ in $L$. The residue field $k(x_0)$ is contained in $L$, and $\mathcal{O}_{x_0 ,X} \twoheadrightarrow k(x_0)$ gives a pull back of valuation on $\mathcal{O}_{x_0, X}$. Then we can find a local subring $T\subset\mathcal{O}_{x_0 ,X} $ with this valuation. Since $T \subset K$, there is a valuation ring $R$ dominates $T$. Then by the assumption, $R$ has a unique center $x_1$ which must be a specialization of $x_0$, but I can't prove this yet. However, if $R$ is also a subring of the valuation ring $R'$ dominating $\mathcal{O}_{x_0, X}$, then we can find a prime ideal in $\mathcal{O}_{x_1, X}$ by taking inverse image of the maximal ideal of $R'$, then we will get an inclusion from $\mathcal{O}_{x_1, X}$ to $\mathcal{O}_{x_0, X}$. Consider $x_1$ as a point in $\{x_0\}^-$, then we can see that $S$ dominates $\mathcal{O}_{x_1, \{x_0\}^-}$.","['valuation-theory', 'ring-theory', 'algebraic-geometry']"

Initially I tried to solve this using sampling without replacement, although I wasn't entirely sure if replacement was a factor here as it wasn't explcitly stated. I didn't get very far, as I got confused with the number of combinations, how many balls were picked and how many would be left in each set etc. As is typical for me when I get confused with a probability question, I wrote out the tuples from the sample space and simply counted - this gave me 72 individual tuples, 18 of which were two balls that were the same colour leaving 54 combinations that would yield two different coloured balls. Thus the probability is $\frac{3}{4}$ I then thought to apply the same logic using combinations and tried to figure out what the probability would be of picking two of the same , event S, coloured balls which gave me $$\mathbb{P}(S)=\frac{{3 \choose 2}{3\choose1}}{9 \choose 2} =\frac{1}{4}$$ 
Thus the event D which is picking two different coloured balls is $$\mathbb{P}(D)=1-\frac{{3 \choose 2}{3\choose1}}{9 \choose 2}=\frac{3}{4}$$ Is this the correct answer?

It is a humorous but surprisingly entertaining thing to watch it move and see if it ever hits the corner exactly . Naturally (at least, for a recreational mathematics enthusiast), the question arose: Given the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of a point inside the rectangle, along with a direction of travel for that point, creating a path where the point, on reaching a side of the rectangle bounces of off it like a light beam, can you create a method of determining whether (given infinite time) the path eventually hits one of the corners exactly ? Equally, and perhaps more interestingly, can you display a construction of a set of initial conditions for a path (for any rectangle) that is not periodic (i.e. if it hits a specific point on the boundary of the rectangle, that point never appears in its path again)? EDIT: In light of @dtldarek's observation, it has become clear that if $x_0, y_0$ are the initial coordinates of the point $p$ in the rectangle with gradient $g\in\mathbb{R}$ in the rectangle with sidelengths $s_0, s_1\in\mathbb{R}$, then the path eventually hits a corner if and only if $\exists n, m \in \mathbb{N}$ and $k\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $$kg+(x_0,y_0) = \frac{ns_0}{ms_1}$$","['recreational-mathematics', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"

To show that they are not homeomorphic we need to find a property that holds in $S^1$ but does not hold in $\mathbb{R}^1$ or vice-versa.
$S^1$ is compact however $\mathbb{R}^1$ is not compact. The set $\{1\} $ is closed, and the map
$$f: \Bbb R^2 \longrightarrow \Bbb R,$$
$$(x, y) \mapsto x^2 + y^2$$
is continuous. Therefore the circle
$$\{(x,y) \in \Bbb R^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 1\} = f^{-1}(\{1\})$$
is closed in $\Bbb R^2$. Set $S^1$ is also bounded, since, for example, it is contained within the ball of radius $2$ centered at 0 of $\Bbb R^2$ (in the standard topology of $\Bbb R^2$). Hence it is also compact. However real line $\Bbb R^1$ is not because there is a cover of open intervals that does not have a finite subcover. For example, intervals (n−1, n+1) , where n takes all integer values in $\mathbb{Z}$, cover $\mathbb{R}$ but there is no finite subcover. Hence $S^1$ can not be isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^1$.

2778263,"Showing $L(p,1)$ (lens space) is a Smooth Manifold and Computing its de Rham Groups","I had my final exam and the professor gave this question which I don't really know how to do. The question: Let $p \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ and let $\mathbb{Z}_p$ act on $\mathbb{C}^2$ by $(z,w) \mapsto (e^{2 \pi i/p}z,e^{2 \pi i /p} w)$. This induces an action on $S^3 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^2$ and the resulting quotient $S^3/\mathbb{Z}$ is referred to as the lens space $L(p,1)$. Show that this lens space is a smooth manifold and computs its de Rham cohomology groups. I've seen the definition before but that's about it. I vaguely remembered that I should probably show something about the group action being properly discontinuous to show that $\pi:S^3 \to L(p,1)$ is a regular covering map. But before even that, how do I know $\pi$ is a quotient map and whether that says $L(p,1)$ is a manifold, let alone smooth? Certainly $L(p,1)$ should be compact and connected as $S^3$ is. I believe it's orientable because multiplication by a complex number is a holomorphism (so orientation preserving) and in $\mathbb{C}^2$, it seems natural to say that a map is holomorphic if and only if its coordinate functions are holomorphic. Thus, $H^0_{dR}(L(p,1) = H^3_{dR}(L(p,1)) = \mathbb{R}$. Also, $S^3$ is the universal cover of $L(p,1)$ and its deck transformations are $\pi_1(L(p,1)) = \mathbb{Z}_p$. Then, since $H^1_{dR}(L(p,1)) \cong H^1(L(p,1), \mathbb{R})$ by de Rham's theorem and $H_1(L(p,1), \mathbb{R}) = H_1(L(p,1),\mathbb{Z}) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{R} = \text{Abel}(\pi_1(L(p,1)) \otimes \mathbb{R} = 0$, $H^1_{dR}(L(p,1)) = 0$. By Poincare duality, $H^2_{dR}(L(p,1))=0$ as well. So the de Rham groups of $L(p,1)$ seem to be the same as $S^3$. My questions: How do we show that $L(p,1)$ is a smooth manifold? How do we show it is orientable? Is my reasoning for the de Rham groups correct? I apologize for being rather wordy.

Is it true that there exists a similar quadrilateral to $ABCD$ such that all of its vertices have the same color, i.e. blue or red? What about a similar quadrilateral with $ABCD$ such that 3 vertices have the same color, and the other one the other color?

However, to extend the equality to $g_1,g_2\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, he proceeds as follows With $g_1\in L^1\cap L^{\infty}$ fixed, the mapping $g_2\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle$ is a linear functional that coincides with $\left\langle f_1,f_2\right\rangle \overline{\left\langle g_1,g_2\right\rangle}$ on the dense subspace $L^1\cap L^{\infty}$. It is therefore bounded and extends to all $g_2\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Up to this point everything seems fine. But now: In the same way, for arbitrary $f_1,f_2$ and $g_2\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the conjugate linear functional $g_1\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle $ equals $\left\langle f_1,f_2\right\rangle \overline{\left\langle g_1,g_2\right\rangle}$ on $L^1\cap L^{\infty}$ and extends to all of $L^2$. The orthogonality relations are therefore established for all $f_j,g_j\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. I believe that this proof is not correct. Reason: a priori the linear operator $g_2\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle$ is not bounded on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, as we do not even know if $V_{g_i}(f_i)\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^{2d})$ yet (it is part of the thesis), so the inner product might not even make sense. Therefore, even if we have extended the linear operator  $g_2\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle$ , which is bounded on $(L^1\cap L^{\infty})(\mathbb{R}^d)$, on the whole $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the resulting operator will not necessarily be still given by the expression $g_2\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle$. A priori, the operator $g_2\mapsto \left\langle V_{g_1}f_1,V_{g_2}f_2\right\rangle$  is unbounded on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ (despite being bounded on $(L^1\cap L^{\infty})(\mathbb{R}^d)$) and the extension we have just found is different - they only agree on $(L^1\cap L^{\infty})(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Hence we cannot deduce that the equality we are looking to prove is preserved by the extension. What do you think, MSE?","['functional-analysis', 'harmonic-analysis', 'fourier-analysis']"

2778564,"Why the Skyscraper Sheaf is Named as Such, Intuition and Interpretation","I have reviewed all the other questions on SE regarding the skyscraper sheaf and I believe my question is not a duplicate. I am also aware that the questions I pose below may be considered ill defined since there is not 'one right answer' - if my question gets closed, so be it - but I just started learning sheaves and they are complicated. With a complicated object like a sheaf, I like to discuss these sorts of things early on with people who have more maturity on the topic to make sure I am interpreting the object in a good way. Please at least skim my high lighted questions to avoid just answering the title, which does not encompass all of my related questions. I have mostly been working with sheaves of abelian groups, but answers involving sheaves that take values in any concrete category should be understandable to me. Probably best to avoid examples and answers involving abstract sheaves that take values in complicated categories like Cat . First of all, there are two definitions of a sheaf. The more modern/common is the functorial definition given on wikipedia, and then there is the étalé space definition given by Serre on the first page of FAC . I give this definition in the questions I asked here , and here . The definition Serre gives is the one I have been using, but the discussion in the comments on the second link briefly discusses why they are 'equivalent'. Some of the explicit sheaves I have encountered that have names seem to make more sense using one definition than the other. For example, the constant sheaf makes more sense to me using the étalé definition, and the skyscraper sheaf, so far, seems to make more sense using the functorial definition. The skyscraper sheaf is the one I would like to discuss. The standard definition given for the skyscraper sheaf (using a sheaf of sets for simplicity), such as in Vakil's notes, is as follows. For a topological space $X$, and a fixed point $x \in X$, and some set $S$, for each open set $U \subset X$, we assign the set of sections $$F(U) := \begin{cases} S, &\text{ if } x \in U,\\ \{e\}, &\text{ if } x \notin U. \end{cases}$$ For sheaves of algebraic objects replace $\{e\}$ by the appropriate terminal object in the category of choice. One can check that the stalks of this sheaf are $$\mathscr{F}_y := \begin{cases} S, &\text{ if } y \in \overline{\{x\}},\\ \{e\}, &\text{ if } y \notin \overline{ \{x\}}. \end{cases}$$ Now we are prepared for questions. 1. Do some skyscraper sheaves not live up to the name? How I think of a sheaf intuitively, or decide what a sheaf should look like, is pretty much determined by its stalks. This makes sense since I use the étalé definition where the actual object that is called the sheaf is the disjoint union of stalks, as opposed to being the functor that determines such data. Now if $X$ is T1, or more generally $x$ is a closed point of $X$, I see that if $S \neq \{b\}$ we get one non-zero stalk $\mathscr{F}_x$ and all other stalks are $\{e\}$. However, if $S = \{b\}$, or if we are in the algebro-geometric case where the space $X$ is usually not T1, $x$ could be a generic point so that its closure was the whole space. Then no matter what $S$ was, every stalk would be $S$. These are two different ways that a, by definition, skyscraper sheaf could turn out to be a constant sheaf. Is there a way I am missing to still interpret these sheaves as skyscrapers, or are they just perverse examples that don't live up to the name? In my next question, for simplicity, I will speak as though $X$ is T1 so that the skyscraper sheaf has exactly one non zero stalk (so $S \neq \{b\}$ also). 2. Is a skyscraper sheaf actually 'tall', or is it just tall compared to everything else around it? When I first heard the name 'skyscraper sheaf' I automatically thought I was about to encounter a massive object like the monster group . However, since I 'picture' a sheaf as a collection of stalks, it doesn't seem that it's one non-zero stalk at $x$ needs to be necessarily 'tall' or 'big'. Since the stalk is a direct limit, and direct limits tend to make bigger things out of smaller things, I first thought maybe I would be getting lots of copies of $S$ for the stalk at $x$, perhaps one for each open neighborhood, which will (maybe) make that stalk very tall. But I quickly thought through this and realized the direct system determining that direct limit is just the identity maps and the same object over and over, yielding the same object for the direct limit, so this can't be why the one non-zero stalk would be a 'skyscraper'. I tend to think of the 'size' or 'height' of a stalk as its size as a set, or group, etc. So if I chose $S = \{a,b\}$ for my one non-zero stalk, by definition I have a sky scraper sheaf, but really to me this is more like a mole hill sheaf because the stalk corresponding to $S$ would not be very tall, even compared to all the 0 stalks around it. But maybe if I quit thinking about a sheafs physical interpretations as only being determined by stalks, I could also consider stalks and sections. Then, even if I choose $S = \{a,b\}$, I have a copy of $S$ at $x$, then as I transition from local to global, taking nested open subsets containing $x$, I get a copy of $S$ for each one. Maybe this is how the sheaf is 'tall' around one point? Then if I do this process anywhere else, my sequence of sections would be 0 until the open subsets were big enough that they also included $x$ (yes, I am not abstractly thinking of the topology, and am thinking of it as being 'like' a euclidean topology or a Hausdorff space, but oh well). 3. Is it possible to define a skyscraper sheaf and end up with something more like an “NYC Sheaf""? As I mentioned above, if $x$ is a non closed point, we could get more non-zero stalks on the closure of $x$. Above I mentioned an extreme case from the Zariski topology where a point may have the entire space as its closure. Are there any naturally arising cases or examples where the closure of a single point is not the whole space? In this case we should have non-zero stalks on some closed neighborhood around $x,$ and then 0 everywhere else. I imagine if I stood back and looked at this sheaf it would look kind of like this arial photograph of NYC where the angle and distance of the photograph make it look like a ton of action packed into one (seemingly) small area, then flat everywhere around it for as far as you can see. This sheaf should be called the NYC Sheaf! Lastly, it is a perfectly acceptable answer that I will gladly upvote (if it is true) to say ""It seems your understanding of a sheaf, and a skyscraper sheaf, is adequate and you are horribly overthinking the name.

By Sylow's theorem it's easy to see $H_1,H_2$ are isomorphic. But it seems hard for me to express the solution of second part clearly. Here is my attempt: Since $H_1, H_2$ can be embedded into $S_8$ and are isomorphic, we can identify them as a same subgroup of $S_8$, say $H$. Then $H_i$ acts on $X_i$ is the same as $H$ acts on $X_i$, which gives the index of elements of $X_i$ from $1$ to $8$, thus induces a bijection $\phi: X_1\to X_2$, s.t. $\phi(h\cdot x)=h\cdot\phi(x)$, for any $h\in H$. Therefore by the identification of $h, g, \pi(g)$, with $g\in H_1$, we have $\phi(g\cdot x)=\pi(g)\cdot\phi(x)$. Another attempt is: Since $S_8$ has an $8$ cycle, $H_1$ must contain an $8$-cycle, say $g_1$. Define $g_2=\pi(g_1)$, thus $g_2$ is also a $8$-cycle. Assume $X_1=\{a_1,...,a_8\}$, with $g_1\cdot a_i\to a_{i+1}$, $g_1\cdot a_8\to a_{1}$. And $X_2=\{b_1,...,b_8\}$, with $g_2\cdot b_i\to b_{i+1}$, $g_2\cdot b_8\to b_{1}$. Define $\phi:X_1\to X_2$, $a_i\mapsto b_i$. This implies that $\pi(g_1^n\cdot a_i)=g_2^n\cdot b_i=g_2^n\cdot\pi(a_i)$. Now assume $x=a_i$, $g\cdot a_i=a_j$, thus $\phi(g\cdot a_i)=b_j$.

2778906,Understanding $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^4} = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$,"In the answer, of this question Nice proofs of $\zeta(4) = \frac{\pi^4}{90}$? , given by Christian Blatter, Why $|c_{\pm k}|^2={1\over4}a_k^2={4\over k^4}$ $\ (k\geq1)$ ? According to my calculations $|c_{\pm k}|^2=\vert1/2\pi\int_{-\pi}^\pi t^2e^{-i(\pm k)x}dx\vert^2=\vert t^2\sin(\pi(\pm k))/\pi(\pm k)\vert^2=0$ And how did he get $\frac{\pi^4}{90}?$ Consider the function $f(t):=t^2\ \ (-\pi\leq t\leq \pi)$ , extended to all of ${\mathbb R}$ periodically with period $2\pi$ . Developping $f$ into a  Fourier series we get $$t^2 ={\pi^2\over3}+\sum_{k=1}^\infty {4(-1)^k\over k^2}\cos(kt)\qquad(-\pi\leq t\leq \pi).$$ If we put $t:=\pi$ here we easily find $\zeta(2)={\pi^2\over6}$ . For $\zeta(4)$ we use Parseval's formula $$\|f\|^2=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty |c_k|^2\ .$$ Here $$\|f\|^2={1\over2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^\pi t^4\>dt={\pi^4\over5}$$ and the $c_k$ are the complex Fourier coefficients of $f$ . Therefore $c_0={\pi^2\over3}$ and $|c_{\pm k}|^2={1\over4}a_k^2={4\over k^4}$ $\ (k\geq1)$ . Putting it all together gives $\zeta(4)={\pi^4\over 90}$ .","['real-analysis', 'fourier-analysis', 'proof-explanation', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"
2778914,A confusion about the second connection axiom of Euclidean Geometry,"In the book of Foundations of Geometry by Hilbert, at page 2, it is stated that I, 1. Two distinct points A and B always completely determine a
  straight line a. We write AB = a or BA = a. I, 2. Any two distinct points of a straight line completely determine
  that line; that is, if AB = a and AC = a, where $B \not = C$, then is also
  BC = a. However, what I understand from ""Any two distinct points of a straight line completely determine that line"" is that given a line $a$, and points $A,B,C$ on that line, we have $AB = AC=BC = a$, but the logical formulation states, i.e the part after ""that is"", that given any 3 point $A,B,C$ s.t $AB = AC = a$ implies $BC = a$ (of course provided that $B \not = C$ in both cases), so is there any explanation how should we understand Any two distinct points of a straight line completely determine that
  line as if AB = a and AC = a, where $B \not = C$, then is also 
  BC = a.","['axiomatic-geometry', 'euclidean-geometry', 'geometry']"

$$ y_p = \frac{Ae^x}{B+De^x}$$ I then go ahead and differentiate $y_p$ and substitute into the first equation to get the following: $$ \frac{AB^3e^x-ABD^2e^{3x}}{(B+De^x)^4} + 3\frac{ABe^x(B+De^x)^2}{(B+De^x)^4}+2\frac{Ae^x(B+De^x)}{(B+De^x)^4} = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$$ From there I got the following:

where $a$ is a constant. What I tried: Let $g:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ an arbitrary uniformly continuous, bounded function. It suffices to show $\mathbb E[g(Y_n X_n)] \to \mathbb E[g(aX)]$. We have 
$$\left \lvert \int g(Y_nX_n) - g(aX) \,dP \right \rvert \leq \left \lvert \int g(Y_n X_n) - g(aX_n) \, dP \right \rvert +\left \lvert \int g(aX_n) - g(aX) \, dP \right \rvert,$$
where the right summand goes to $0$ by assumption as $a$ is constant. Now I want to use uniform continuity of $g$ to estimate the left summand: Choose $\delta > 0 $ such that $$\left \lvert g(Y_n X_n) - g(aX_n) \right \rvert < \epsilon,$$
whenever $|Y_n X_n - aX_n| < \delta.$ Since convergence in distribution to a constant implies convergence in probability, we have can control $P(|Y_n - a | > \delta)$. But is it possible to get a bound on $|X_n|$? I assume that probability in distribution does not imply some form of boundedness... Any help is appreciated.","['real-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'probability-distributions', 'probability', 'convergence-divergence']"
