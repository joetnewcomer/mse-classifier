101676,Proof of no simple group of order 992,"Prove there are no simple groups of order $992$. Factorise it. $31 \times 2^5 $ so you have $|G|=31 \times 2^5 \geq n_{31}(31-1)+ n_{2}(2^5-1)+1$ Putting it in Sylow theorem. So how do you get the contradiction? Or is this totally wrong. I need to use Sylow theorem to prove this. Hmm, can someone describe how you prove this. I know the Sylow the theorems well the proof of them. It seems from the notes you have to start with $n_{2}>1$ and then $n_2=1(mod2)$. However, I don't understand this at all.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
101677,The zero set of sums of polynomials,"As I am new to this forum, please correct me if this post is not appropriate. In that case I apologize. Let $P(z)$ and $Q(z)$ be polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$, furthermore let $Z(P)$ and $Z(Q)$ denote their zero sets. What can be said about $Z(P+Q)$? Without imposing any further restrictions on $P$ and $Q$. I see that  $Z(P)  \cap   Z(Q) \subset Z(P+Q)$. Or if we additionally assume that one of the polynomials dominates $P+Q$ in the sense that $|P(z)|\geq|P(z)+Q(z)|$  for all $z\in \mathbb{C}$, then clearly also $Z(P)\subset Z(P+Q)$ holds. Without imposing to harsh restrictions (Very vague, I know) on the involved polynomials, what can be said? Lastly, I really appreciate any help from you.","['complex-analysis', 'abstract-algebra', 'polynomials']"

101718,A problem concerning action via automorphisms,"This problem asks to show that if $A$ acts on $G$ via automorphisms, where either $A$ or $G$ is soluble and both $A$ and $G$ are finite groups and $G$ is nontrivial, then $G$ possesses an $A$-invariant $p$-subgroup. My original attempt at a solution was this: If $G$ is soluble, then $F(G)>1$, in which case any nontrivial Sylow subgroup of $F(G)$, being characteristic all the way up to $G$, will do the trick. If $A$ is soluble, choose as above some Sylow $p$-subgroup of $F(A)$, say $P$. Certainly $P$ is normal in $A$ and my claim here is that there exists some $P$-invariant Sylow $q$-subgroup of G, regardless of the condition that $p$ divides $|G|$ or not. If $p$ does not divide $|G|$, then a direct appeal to the extended version of the Sylow theorems for coprime actions proves the claim. If $p$ divides $|G|$, then consider the action of $P$ on $Ω = Syl_p(G)$, which is nonempty. Then $|Ω| =$ sum of $P$-orbits, each a $p$-power, while $|Ω| = 1 (mod p)$. Some $P$-orbit must therefore be a singleton set, meaning that $P$ fixes this particular Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. Thus, in all cases the claim holds. Now suppose that the $P$-invariant Sylow subgroup of $G$ is $Q$, where it's possible that $p$ divides $|Q|$. Then for any $u \in P$ and $a \in A$, $aua^{-1} \in P$. Hence $aua^{-1}(Q)=Q$, implying that $a(Q)Qa^{-1}(Q)=Q$. Thus $a(Q)$ is a subgroup of $N_G(Q)$ and also a Sylow $q$-subgroup of $G$, because $a$ (being an automorphism) maps Sylow subgroups to Sylow subgroups. Therefore $a(Q)$ is a member of $Syl_q(N_G(Q))$, the sole member of which is $Q$. Finally $a(Q)=Q$ for all $a \in A$ and we are done. The last paragraph contains an error, but I'm not sure what that is. I haven't used anywhere that $P>1$. But if $P$ is trivial, then $Q$ can be an arbitrary Sylow subgroup of $G$, and of course, $Q$ is not necessarily fixed by $A$.","['finite-groups', 'group-theory']"

A connection $\nabla:\mathcal{A}^0(E) \to \mathcal{A}^1(E)$ extends to a map $\nabla:\mathcal{A}^k(E) \to \mathcal{A}^{k+1}(E)$ by setting $\nabla(\alpha \otimes s)= d \alpha \otimes s + (-1)^k \alpha \wedge\nabla s$ and we can define the curvature of $\nabla$ as the composition $F_\nabla=\nabla \circ \nabla: \mathcal{A}^0(E) \to \mathcal{A}^2(E)$. From the Leibniz rule one can see that $F_{\nabla}(fs) = f F_{\nabla}(s)$ and therefore we can view $F_\nabla$ as an element of $\mathcal{A}^2(\text{End}(E))$ ($F_\nabla$ evaluated at a pair of tangent vectors is the endomorphism $s \mapsto F_\nabla(X,Y)(s)$.

101776,Can the Differential be Considered as a Covariant Functor?,"First, I apologize if this question is poorly-worded or otherwise vague, I'll try to be as clear as possible. If $F:N\rightarrow M$ is a smooth map between smooth manifolds $N$ and $M$, then at each point $p \in N$ the map $F$ induces the derivation $F_{*p}:T_pN \rightarrow  T_{F(p)}M$ between tangent spaces, called the differential, that is determined by $F_{*p}(X_p)f = X_p(f \circ F)$ for all smooth real-valued functions $f$ on $M$. To me, this seems like a covariant functor from the category of smooth manifolds to the category (?) of tangent spaces. My understanding though if it is to be a functor  it must also assign, for example, a manifold $M$ to a tangent space $T_pM$. Are there additional aspects of defining the differential that would facilitate this? Is there a way, perhaps, that this can be achieved with the inclusion maps $i_N$ and $i_M$ of $N$ and $M$ into $T_pN$ and $T_pN$ since the differential, satisfies $F_{*p} \circ i_N = i_N \circ F$?","['manifolds', 'functors', 'category-theory', 'differential-geometry']"

101886,What is the insight behind the Lebesgue integral?,"Edit 3: OK, I had an insight, inspired in part by Ben-Blum Smith's comment, and the post he linked to.  (I have no idea if this insight is right; it's barely a hunch, and that's why I'm not submitting it as an answer to my original question [see below], but I'll throw it out there for criticism.)  I vaguely remember a theorem on the rearrangement the terms of infinite series showing that, at least for some series, for any $L$, it was possible to find a rearrangement of the terms that would cause the rearranged series to ""converge"" to $L$.  IIRC, this fact was somehow related to the such series were somewhat difficult to work with.  In any case, allowing any rearrangement of the terms, it seems, causes problems down the line, but if we were able to agree upon some reasonable canonicalization of the rearrangement procedure, or to put it differently, if we could find a reasonable way to define admissible rearrangements , this could be the basis for a new definition of an infinite series such that more series would converge (i.e. such that there would be a more robust definition of the series' limiting value).  One such canonicalization would go like this: divide the range of the series by some standard mesh (e.g. by numbers of the form $m/2^n$, for some fixed integer $n$, and all integers $m$ in some suitable interval).  Now rearrange the series by collecting together all the terms of the original series whose values lie within the same cell of the mesh, and ordering these ""grouped terms"" in decreasing order of their cell's value.  Then the series could be approximated by a weighted sum of these cell values.  This canonicalized sum would be immune to the pathologies caused by arbitrary rearrangements.  One would then need to show that this procedure behaves reasonably as one lets the size of the mesh go to zero. Could something like this lead to the Lebesgue integral? Edit 4: One point I did not make sufficiently clear in ""Edit 3"" is that one could rationalize the concern with rearrangements by noting that one property that would be desirable in a definition of an integral is that it remains invariant relative to order in which the sum is performed.  The standard definition of the Riemann integral, as a sum that is ordered along the domain of integration, is susceptible to all the problems that one runs into when reordering infinite series (as alluded to above), which is unfortunate, considering that, when one works with sufficiently general functions, the ordering of the domain of integration should be irrelevant to the value of the integral: it should be possible to rearrange the domain of integration in fairly crazy ways and end up with the exact same integral.  In contrast, the procedure described in Edit 3 eliminates this dependence on any particular ordering of the domain of integration, and replaces it with a focus on the ordering of the range, which at least has a meaningful relationship to the value of the integral .  Also, it is clear why this alternative viewpoint shifts the focus to the problem of defining ""measures"" on sets, since these ""measures"" are precisely the weights assigned to the grouped terms in the new summation procedure. [Original post] I understand the definitions of the Lebesgue integral and of the Riemann integral, but it is not obvious to me from these definitions that the former would be the more suitable of the two for, say, probability theory, or for defining the Fourier transform, or for defining inner products in Hilbert space, etc. What was exactly the insight that led to the Lebesgue integral as a superior alternative to the Riemann integral? Thanks! Edit 1: after looking at the comments/answers so far (with one exception) I realized that the leading wording of my question was quite inept.  I've highlighted the part of my original question that is least ineptly put.  I know that Lebesgue integrals have all the advantages cited, but it is utterly mystifying to me how anyone could have seen ahead of time that this had to be the case.  What made this alternative approach (of the Lebesgue integral) look promising?  I know that it's perfectly possible that there was no clue that this approach would be fruitful: someone (Lebesgue, I suppose) just tried it, played with it for a while, and discovered all these unsuspected benefits, and had the latter not happened, the new approach would have been quietly forgotten.  But, just in case there is some clue (even a ""clue-in-hindsight"") of the alternative POV's superiority, I would love to see it.  (The ""one exception"" I mentioned above is Christian Blatter's answer, which goes in the direction I was trying to get at, but I'd like to give my question a second shot.) Edit 2: To be fair to the commenters, I have not finished digesting all the previous posts linked to in the comments; they may very well be what I was looking for.

101911,"If a rational function is real on the unit circle, what does that say about its roots and poles?","While doing a bit of self study, I ran across a situation whose wording confused me. Suppose $R(z)$ is some rational function which is real on the circle $|z|=1$ in the complex plane. The question asks, how are the zeros and poles situated? I don't quite understand this, what does it mean by how they're ""situated""? Is there some trick I'm supposed to use here? Does a nice scenario pop out, like they're reflections across the origin or the axes from each other or something similar? From the comments and help, I think I've made a little progress. If $R(c)=0$, then $\overline{R(1/\bar{c})}=0$, and thus $R(1/\bar{c})=0$ by conjugating again. So switching the roles shows $c$ is a root iff $1/\bar{c}$ is a root, and $c$ is a pole iff $1/\bar{c}$ is a pole? And I think the geometric description to this situation is that inversion in the unit circle preserves poles and roots. Also, the roots and poles come in pairs except when $c=1/\bar{c}$, that is, when $|c|=1$. So the only thing I can think of is that the roots come in pairs off the unit circle, and the poles come in pairs off the unit circle, plus some possible unpaired roots and poles on the unit circle.

102073,What do $dz$ and $|dz|$ mean?,"I'm having a hard time understanding complex differentials.

dx_i(e_j)=\begin{cases}1 & \mbox{ for }j=i,\\ 0 & \mbox{ for }j \neq i.\end{cases}$$ So defined $dx_i$ form a basis of $\mathrm{Lin}(\mathbb K^n,\mathbb K)$ Now I have the symbol $dz$ for $z$ being a complex variable and I'm not sure I understand what it means. I know that this is supposed to be true and a definition of $dz:$ $$dz =d\:\mathrm{Re}(z)+id\:\mathrm{Im}(z).$$ I cannot fathom this definition though. What is the space in which the operations on the right-hand side are performed? $\mathrm{Re}(z)$ and $\mathrm{Im}(z)$ are real variables, right? So the space should be $\mathrm{Lin}(\mathbb R^2,\mathbb R).$ But this is an $\mathbb R -$space, not a $\mathbb C -$space so the multiplication by $i$ shouldn't be allowed. And then I see the symbol $|dz|$ and integrals are computed with it, like here , page 3. What does this symbol mean? Edit: I would like to improve the formulation of a part of my problem and post my newly found (thanks to the comments) answer to that part. Let's take the equality $$dz=dx+idy,$$ where $x=\mathrm{Re}(z)$ and $y=\mathrm{Im}(z).$ According to the definition in the first paragraph of this post, $dz$ is a $\mathbb C-$linear map, $dz:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C,$ and $dz=\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb C}.$ On the other hand, $dx$ and $dy$ are $\mathbb R-$linear maps, $dx,dy:\mathbb R^2\to \mathbb R$ given by $$
\begin{eqnarray}
dx(e_1)=1,\\
dx(e_2)=0,\\
dy(e_1)=0,\\
dy(e_2)=1.
\end{eqnarray}
$$ I understand that I should carry out the identification: $$\mathbb R^2\ni e_1\mapsto 1\in\mathbb C,$$$$\mathbb R^2\ni e_2\mapsto i\in \mathbb C.$$ This gives me $$
\begin{eqnarray}
dx(1)=1,\\
dx(i)=0,\\
dy(1)=0,\\
dy(i)=1.
\end{eqnarray}
$$ These are clearly not $\mathbb{C}-$linear maps. This was my problem. $dy$ is not a $\mathbb{C}-$linear map but just an $\mathbb{R}-$linear map from $\mathbb C$ into $\mathbb R.$ The set of all such linear maps is an $\mathbb R-$vector space, not a $\mathbb{C}-$vector space so there is no such thing as the product $i\cdot dy.$ However, after Pierre-Yves Gaillard's comments, I realized that I should also carry out another identification -- in the codomains of $dx$ and $dy:$
$$\mathbb R \ni 1 \mapsto 1\in \mathbb C,$$ that is consider the codomains of $dx$ and $dy$ to be the real axis of the complex plane. This doesn't make $dx$ and $dy$ $\mathbb C-$linear maps, but it does make them complex functions and so allows them to be multiplied by $i$. And indeed, now 
$$dz=\operatorname{id}_{\mathbb C}=dx+idy.$$ I'm sorry about being so obtuse. I'm not sure this question has any value at all to the community, so perhaps I should remove this part? However, I still do not understand what the definition of $|dz|$ is in these terms.","['differential-forms', 'complex-analysis']"

I wish to show: Any closed interval of $\omega_1$ is compact under the order topology. At first I thought it false for the following reason: Take $[1, \omega^2]$ ($\omega$ is the first countable ordinal), which contains countably-many countable ordinals ($\omega \cdot n$ for each $n \in \omega$). If the cover of $[1, \omega^2$] is such that no open set contains more than one countable ordinal, then it cannot be reduced to a finite subcover. The flaw in my reasoning: There is no countable ordinal that is the immediate predecessor of $\omega^2$. Any open set containing $\omega^2$ is going to contain all but finitely-many ordinals of the form $\omega \cdot n$. As we go out toward $\omega_1$, the open sets around certain limit ordinals are going to take bigger ""bites"". Can this idea be made rigorous?

So equating coefficients gives $f(n+1)=f(n)+nf(n-1)$ for $n\geq 1$. Moreover, and explicit formula is found by noting

At another point B on the ceiling, at a distance d from C (where d > r ), a rope of length l is attached and passed through the pulley at F and connected to a weight W .

102242,"For integer partitions, why does $e(n)-o(n)=k(n)$?","I denote by $e(n)$ is the number of partitions of $n$ with an even number of even parts, $o(n)$ the number of those with an odd number of even parts, and $k(n)$ the number of those that are self-conjugate. The claim is that $e(n)-o(n)=k(n)$. By the answer in Aryabhata's comment, I know that 
$$
\sum_{n\geq 0}(e(n)-o(n))x^n=\prod_{i\geq 1}(1+(-1)^ix^i)^{-1}.
$$ I also know identity 
$$
\prod_{i\geq 1}(1+x^i)=\prod_{i\geq 1}(1-x^{2i-1})^{-1},
$$
so plugging in $-x$ yields and inverting gives
$$
\prod_{i\geq 1}(1+(-1)^ix^i)^{-1}=\prod_{i\geq 1}(1+x^{2i-1}).

In any case, $\max$ certainly must be commutative, and must satisfy $\max(A,A) = A$. Also, if $A$ and $B$ share the same eigenvectors, with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ and $\mu_i$ respectively, then it seems natural that $\max(A,B)$ should also have eigenvectors the same, and eigenvalues $\max(\lambda_i,\mu_i)$.

102308,The Degree of the Tangent Bundle for a Riemann Surface,"A well known result states that the degree of the tangent bundle $TX$ of a Riemann Surface $X$ of genus $g$ is exactly $2-2g$. In my mind the genus is intuitively the number of ""handles"" of the surface, and precisely it is the dimension of the $\mathbb{C}$-vector space $\Omega_1(X)$ of holomorphic 1-forms on $X$. Googling around I noticed that the number $2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface. Question 1 (Answered in the comments) I checked the relation for some small-genus surfaces by finding an explicit triangulation, but how can I prove it? Then it comes the definition of degree of a line bundle $L$ over $X$. I can view it in two different, but equivalent, ways. On one hand it is the degree of the associated divisor on $X$ as in Hartshorne, on the other hand it is the ""weighted"" sum of zeroes of a general section, as in page 16 of those lecture notes . It is clear why the two definitions are the same and are independent from the choice of the general section. The unique way I see for computing the degree of a line bundle is to find a ""smart"" section, but I failed to find one in this case of the tangent bundle. Question 2 There are other effective ways to compute it? Otherwise what could be a good choice for a section?

What I know: Final bacteria count on a person's finger: $X$ Transfer efficiency from surface to finger: $PT_i=\displaystyle \frac{\text{Finger contact area}}{\text{Area of surface}_i}\frac{1}{\gamma_i}$ where $\gamma$ is a surface dependent constant.

102417,An elementary version of Laplace's Method of Succession,"I'm currently taking a probability course, and in lecture, my professor went over an example which he called Laplace's method of succession. Basically, there are $n+1$ cards, $k$ of which are successes (the $k$ is uniformly distributed). A $k$ is chosen, and you see $n$ of the cards (after shuffling). The problem is to determine the probability the next trial turns up a success. Here's an account of how he explained the problem: There are two possibilities, either there are $k$ successes in the $n+1$ trials or $k+1$ successes. The probability of each $k$ is uniformly distributed, so we will give $P(k \text{ successes})=P(k+1 \text{ successes})=\frac{1}{2}$. So, we can write the desired probability as $P(1\ |\ k \text{ successes in }n\text{ trials})$ (where $1$ is a success on the next draw and $0$ is failure). We use the definition of conditional probability to get that
\begin{equation}
P(1 \ | k \text{ successes in }n\text{ trials})=\frac{P(1 \text{ and }k\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials})}{P(k\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials})}
\end{equation}
Again, using the definition of conditional probabilities and Bayes' rule, that is equal to
\begin{equation}
\frac{P(1)P(k\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials}\,|\, 1)}{P(1)P(k\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials}\ |\  1)+P(0)P(k\text{ successes in }n\text{ trials}\ | \ 0)}
\end{equation} Now, he said that this expression is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{k+1}{n+1}}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{k+1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{n+1-k}{n+1}}=\frac{k+1}{n+2}
\end{equation} My question is how did he get $\frac{k+1}{n+1}$ and $\frac{n+1-k}{n+1}$ as the answers to the above conditional probabilities? They seem to only denote the chance of drawing success or failure from $n+1$ cards. Furthermore, today in class, he proved that the function which takes the number of black balls (given one black and one white to start) drawn from Polya's urn (sampling with double replacement) is evenly distributed, and said it had a connection to this problem, but did not elaborate.

First I've shown $\partial_S H\subseteq S\cap \partial_T H$ as follows: $x\in \partial_S H$ if and only if for every (open) neighbourhood $U\subseteq S$ of $x$ both $U\cap H\neq\emptyset$ and $U\cap H^c\neq\emptyset$ hold.
Now, if $V$ is open in $T$ then $U=V\cap S$ is open in $S$ and $U\cap H, U\cap H^c\neq\emptyset$, so in particular $V\cap H, V\cap H^c\neq\emptyset$.

Then, if $U=V\cap S$ is open in $S$ (where $V$ is open in $T$), we'd like to say that $U\cap H\neq\emptyset$ (similarly for $H^c$), but we should use that U is open also in $T$, which is true if $S$ is open in $T$.

The following relation on the additive group $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers is a congruence relation $a\sim b \leftrightarrow a-b\in \mathbb{Z}$. Denote for $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$  the set of all those equivalence classes. Let $p$ be a prime and $$\mathbb{Z}(p^{\infty})=\{\overline{a/b}\in \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}\;|\; a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\text{ and }b=p^{i}\text{ for some } i\geq 0\}.$$ I am trying to define a vector space structure on $\mathbb{Z}(p^{\infty})$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, but I think it is impossible. For example, if $\mathbb{F}$ is uncountable, it can't be done. But I don't know to answer this question when $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{F})=q$, where $q$ is a prime number.

102468,Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space is dense?,"Let $E=C[0,1]$ , space of all real-valued continuous functions on $[0,1]$ , $\mathcal{E}$ be its Borel $\sigma$ -algebra and $\mu$ a Gaussian measure on $E$ . Let $E^*$ be a space of all continuous linear functions on $E$ . Define map $R$ on $E^*$ by $$x^* \mapsto R(x^*)=\int_E\langle x^*,x\rangle x\;\mu(dx)=\int_E x^*(x)\; x\;\mu(dx)$$ And let $H_\mu$ be the completion of $R(E^*)$ with respect a norm induced by an inner product defined as $\langle Rx^*,Ry^* \rangle=\int_Ex^*(x)y^*(y)\;\mu(dx)$ . $H_\mu$ stands for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and it is dense $^1$ in $E$ if topological support $^2$ of $\mu$ is the whole space $E$ . Why? I think I understand the construction well enough, but the statement is somewhat unexpected. $^1$ $i(H_\mu)$ to be precise, $i$ for inclusion from $H_\mu$ to $E$ . $^2$ topological support is the smallest closed set $F$ such that $\mu(F) = 1$ . Edit This is page 84 of Interest Rate Models: an Infinite Dimensional Stochastic Analysis Perspective. Read online on Springer: Link (the statement is on page 88)","['functional-analysis', 'stochastic-processes', 'hilbert-spaces', 'probability']"
