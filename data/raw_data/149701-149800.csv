2483765,Doubt in the proof of Banach-Steinhaus Theorem,"Theorem: Let $V$ be a Banach Space and $W$ be a normed linear space. Let $I$ be an arbitrary indexing set and for each $i\in I$ , let $T_i\in L(V,W)$ .

This is how the proof goes by, For each $x$ , define $\phi(x)=\sup_{i\in I}\|T_i(x)\|$ Define $V_n=\{x\in V| \;\phi(x)>n\}$ . $V_n$ is open for each $n$ . Assume now that there exists $N$ such that $V_N$ fails to be dense in $V$ . Then there exists $x_0\in V$ and $r>0$ such that $x+x_0\notin V_N$ if $\|x\|<r.$ This implies that $\phi(x+x_0)\le N$ for all such $x$ and so, for all $i\in I$ $\|T_i(x+x_0)\|\le N$ . Thus if $\|x\|\le r/2$ , we have , for all $i\in I$ , $\|T_i(x)\|\le \|T_i(x+x_0)\|+\|T_i(x_0)\|\le 2N$ It follows from this that, for all $i\in I$ , $\|T_i\|\le \frac{4N}{r}$ I do not understand how the above highlighted argument holds.

probability law is specified by the probabilities of the events that consist of
a single element. In particular, the probability of any event $\{s_1, s_2, . . . , s_n\}$

counterparts in that the probabilities of the single-element events may not be
sufficient to characterize the probability law. Discrete probability law deals with finite sample spaces, but continuous probability models deal with continuous sample spaces.

2484320,Higher dimensional total derivative,"I'm teaching myself some higher dimensional calculus, and I am currently stuck on the definition of the total derivative. The book I'm using is Principles of Mathematical Analysis by Walter Rudin, and he defines the derivative as Suppose $E$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f$ maps $E$ into
  $\mathbb{R}^m$, and $x \in E$. If there exists a linear transformation
  $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that
  $$ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|f(x + h) - f(x) - Ah|}{|h|} = 0, $$ then we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and we write $$ f'(x) = A. $$ My confusion stems from the $Ah$ term for two reasons: other texts define this term as $L(v)$ for some linear function $L$, and because Rudin also writes that ""since $A \in L(\mathbb{R}^n, \mathbb{R}^m), Ah \in \mathbb{R}^m$"" which both indicate that $A$ is taking $h$ as an argument. This doesn't make sense to me, for suppose that $f$ were to also be linear, then the limit implies that the linear function $A$ is $f$ itself: If we write $A(h)$ to emphasise that $A$ is a function of $h$, then by the linearity of $f$ the numerator of the limit becomes
$$
f(x + h) - f(x) - A(h) = f(h) - A(h)
$$
so that the limit is zero precisely when $A = f$. However, the derivative of a linear function shouldn't be the same linear function! What is the correct way to understand this definition? And how might I go about finding the derivative of an arbitrary function? For example, what is the derivative of the function

g : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}, g(x, y) = xy

2484343,What is the motivation behind the arbitrary union topological axiom?,"1. Why is the arbitrary union axiom in the definition of topology necessary? 2. Why is it useful? Why might we expect (""intuitively"") that it should be useful? 3. What is the (historical) motivation for the axiom? Please do not read any of the below unless you are really bored or have a lot of time to kill; the essence of my question is the above. In what follows, I will follow Dellacherie and Meyer in denoting: $\underset{f}{\cup}$ = finite unions $\underset{c}{\cup}$ = countable unions $\underset{u}{\cup}$ = uncountable unions $\underset{a}{\cup}$ = arbitrary unions Similar notation applies for intersections. In what follows I will take closure under (relative) complementation for granted, simply because almost all set systems which I know of (besides $\pi$ systems) have this property, its motivation is obvious, and because it is involutory it is easily added to the axioms of a set system without changing the included sets very much. Most spaces which are commonly studied have at most the continuity of the continuum (not that there aren't counterexamples, but at least I don't run into them in my work). Thus, it seems we could have at most the following types of set systems for a space which has at most the cardinality of the continuum. $\underset{f}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$ (Boolean) algebra $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/$\underset{c}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ (slightly stronger than a $\lambda$ system) $\underset{c}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$ $\sigma-$algebra $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{c}{\cup}$  ????? Related: Is there a difference between allowing only countable unions/intersections, and allowing arbitrary (possibly uncountable) unions/intersections? $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{f}{\cap}$/ $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$, $\underset{f}{\cup}$ systems of open sets (topologies)/systems of closed sets resepctively $\underset{u/a}{\cup}$, $\underset{u/a}{\cap}$ Alexandroff topologies The motivation for the set axioms of a Boolean algebra are obvious, because they basically constitute ""closure under elementary logical operations"". For example, all truth functions are well-defined given a Boolean algebra, as is propositional logic. The motivation for a $\sigma-$algebra is also fairly clear to me -- it is essentially the ""countable closure/extension"" of a regular algebra, and this property allows us to define countably additive set functions, and along with that obtain closure under pointwise limits of functions as well as the monotone convergence theorem, the two foundations on which integration theory is based. It is also clear that such additivity could not be extended to the cardinality of the continuum, since the uncountable sum of any non-zero numbers is infinite. But why do open/closed set systems turn out to be useful? How are these uncountable axioms applied fruitfully in topology? As far as I am aware, for example with stochastic processes, we usually rely on some separability/first/second-countability properties in order to be able to apply most topologies fruitfully -- i.e. some reduction of the ""uncountable"" axiom to an essentially countable property. So why not study only metric spaces? Moreover, the study of limits is only defined/sensible once we have the T1 and T2 separation axioms, so the claim that we study set systems of type 5. in order to study limits seems unjustified to me; at the very least we need that in combination with some separation axioms. Also, why do we study set systems of type 5., but not of types 4. or 6.? What is the essential property that type 5. set systems capture (in the way that type 1. and type 3. systems capture)? The best discussion of this topic which I have found so far: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19152/why-is-a-topology-made-up-of-open-sets I agree with the OP of that question however, that the top-voted answer is more of a justification for the notion of metric space (which are always separable in some sense due to the density of the rationals in the reals). The discussion of how notions of limit really seem to be more of a consequence of a notion of ""Hausdorfness"" is here: Why not just study the consequences of Hausdorff axiom? What do statements like, ""The arbitrary union of open sets is open,"" gain us? I would also like to point out that the axiomatization of topology in terms of neighborhood systems, plus the Hausdorff axiom, seems to be more relevant to understanding the concept of ""limit"" than the axioms of a general topological space. And again, I don't see why we would need uncountably many neighborhoods of a given point to define it as the limit of something, since countably many neighborhoods always suffices (at least in the metric space setting). Motivation: The motivation for this question came from some rumination about stochastic processes. Namely, the reason why their study can be so difficult is that we are confined to using set systems of type 3., which are only countably closed, whereas we are studying uncountably many random variables. In order to get any degree of meaningful results, we therefore rely on having some degree of ""separability/regularity"" properties that essentially allow us to reduce to the countable case where it counts (for instance with regards to the existence of regular conditional distributions). So as frustrating as it may be trying to study uncountable objects with set systems of type 3., it is clear to me why we can not replace such set systems with any of type 4, 5, or 6, again so that integration and probability are tractable. So then I thought ""oh so we must use topologies because we need uncountability for some reason"". But then I thought about how almost all topologies which I am aware of/use are in some way ""separable"" or ""first/second-countable"", which basically constitutes reducing back to the countable case, the same way we do with stochastic processes. I.e. there is no fundamental gain in generality, since the only cases of uncountable objects we can/do study are those special cases which can be reduced back to the countable case in some meaningful way. I'm really at a loss as to why an uncountable closure axiom would be at all useful, and why we would want only finite closure for the complementary operation, rather than some type of infinite closure. I feel like it has to have something to do with the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" spaces, which leads us back again to the study of stochastic processes, and the distinction between ""discrete"" and ""continuous"" time. Namely, for a set with countable cardinality, like the natural numbers, the power set coincides with the reasonable choices for sigma algebra and topology. In other words, both concepts are clearly only needed when moving to the uncountable case, where they don't necessarily coincide with the power set, i.e. we can gain a concept of ""continuousness"", rather than the ""discreteness"" which we are necessarily confined to with set systems of countable sets. Again, the purpose of $\sigma-$algebra in this case is clear to me, since it is actually only closed under countable set operations, but now I really don't understand why we are able to use the uncountable set axiom profitably in open/closed set systems, especially since in all cases which I am aware of we have some sort of ""separability"" which reduces the concept of topology to a countable one. So why not define the concept which we actually use, which is countable, not uncountable in nature?","['math-history', 'soft-question', 'measure-theory', 'elementary-set-theory', 'general-topology']"

I need some help with calculating the limit $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{n\ln(n)}.$$
I think that it's easy to see that we can find it using d'Alembert (square root) criterion, because, obviously, $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}_{\geqslant 2}:\phi_n>0$, where $\left(\phi_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{\geqslant 2}},\,\phi_n:=\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{n\ln(n)}$, so I did the following observation:
$$\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{n\ln(n)}=\dfrac{1}{n}\cdot\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{\ln(n)}=\dfrac{\dfrac{1}{n}\ln(n!)}{\ln(n)}=\dfrac{\ln(n!)^{\frac{1}{n}}}{\ln(n)}=\dfrac{\displaystyle\sqrt[n]{\ln(n!)}}{\ln(n)}=\displaystyle\sqrt[n]{\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{\ln^n(n)}}.$$
Ok. d'Alembert tells me that I should do the limit
$$\ell:=\lim_{n\to\infty}\bigg\lvert\dfrac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\bigg\lvert=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{x_{n+1}}{x_n},$$
where $\left(x_n\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}_{\geqslant 2}},\,x_n:=\dfrac{\ln(n!)}{\ln^n(n)}$. We have, then:
$$\ell=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{\ln[(n+1)!]}{\ln^{n+1}(n+1)}\cdot\dfrac{\ln^n(n)}{\ln(n!)}=\cdots=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left[\dfrac{\ln(n)}{\ln(n+1)}\right]^n\left[\dfrac{1}{\ln(n+1)}+\dfrac{1}{\ln(n!)}\right]$$

Is it true that $\omega$ is invariant under the antipodal map? i.e let $f(x)=-x$ , does $f^*\omega=\omega$ hold? The assumption implies that for any hemisphere $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^2$ , we have $$ \int_{A}\omega=\int_{f(A)}\omega=\int_{A}f^*\omega=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \omega. \tag{1}$$ Edit: Lemma 1: $\omega$ satisfies $(1)$ if and only if $\int_{A}L_X\omega=0$ for every  Killing field $X$ and hemisphere $A$ . Proof: $\Rightarrow$ Suppose $\omega$ satisfies $(1)$ : Let $\phi_t$ be the flow of a Killing field $X$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$ , and let $A$ be a hemisphere. Since all the $\phi_t(A)$ are hemispheres we get $$ \int_{\phi_t(A)}\omega=\int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\text{const},$$ so $$ 0=\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0} \int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=0}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}L_X\omega.$$ $\Leftarrow$ Suppose $\omega$ satisfies $\int_{A}L_X\omega=0$ for every  Killing field $X$ and hemisphere $A$ : Let $A$ be a hemisphere. We want to show $ \int_{A}\omega=\int_{-A}\omega$ . There exist a Killing field $X$ s.t its flow takes $A$ to $-A$ at some time $t=t_0$ . (i.e if $\phi_t$ is the flow, $\phi_{t_0}(A)=-A$ ). Now, $$ \frac{d}{dt}|_{t=s} \int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\frac{d}{dt}|_{t=s}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{A}\phi_s^*L_X\omega=\int_{\phi_s(A)}L_X\omega=0,$$ where the last equality is exactly the assumption. Since $s$ was arbitrary, this implies $\int_{A}\phi_t^*\omega=\int_{\phi_t(A)}\omega$ is independent of $t$ , so in particular $$\int_{A}\omega=\int_{\phi_0(A)}\omega=\int_{\phi_{t_0}(A)}\omega=\int_{-A}\omega,$$ as required. Lemma 2: The conditions in lemma 1 are equivalent to $\int_{C} i_X\omega=0$ for any great circle $C$ and Killing field $X$ . Proof: Let $C$ be a great circle. $C$ bounds a hemisphere $A$ .
By Cartan's magic formula, $L_x\omega=d(i_X\omega)$ , so $$ \int_{A}L_X\omega=\int_{A} d(i_X\omega)=\int_{\partial A} i_X\omega=\int_{C} i_X\omega.$$ Since any hemisphere has a great circle for a boundary we are done. Discussion: Let $\tilde \omega$ be the standard round volume. Let $\omega=h\tilde \omega$ be an arbitrary form. $\omega$ is invariant iff $h(x)=h(-x)$ . By looking at a great circle $C$ , we see that the condition in lemma 2 is equivalent to $$ \int_C   h|_{C}(\theta)\sin \theta=0,  \int_C   h|_{C}(\theta)\cos \theta=0.$$ This is because the space of Killing fields on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is $3$ -dimensional, and one non-trivial Killing field always fixes the two hemispheres bounded by $C$ , so we are effectively left with two equations. Now, as mentioned by  Anthony Carapetis ,  there is a solution which is not $\pi$ -periodic: We can just take $h$ to be constant along latitude's, and for latitude $\theta$ , set $h(\theta)=2+\sin(3\theta)$ . However, this solution cannot be lifted to a suitable candidate on the sphere.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-forms', 'spheres', 'symmetry', 'differential-geometry']"

2485474,What is wrong in this characterisation of open sets containing all rationals?,"I am having a problem understanding what's wrong with this:I know statement 1 is false and 2 is true but I can't find the mistake.
1)Any open set in $R$ is a countable union of disjoint open intervals. So if we take any open set containing all rationals its complement contains only irrational points. But because endpoint of one interval is the starting point of the next, we can associate the right endpoint of any interval(which is irrational) to each interval. Hence the number of irrational points in the complement is countable.
2)We can construct an open set in $R$ with measure less than $1$ containing all rationals. Hence its complement will have infinite measure and is uncountable.","['real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"
2485485,Extending the adjunction between the global section functor of a quasicoherent sheaf with module sheafification,"So adjoint functors are one thing that has caused me endless pain since trying to learn algebraic geometry. They still haven't really ""clicked"" like they should have. I've been told that it makes it easier to work with the counit and unit of adjunction, but I tend to find these even harder. I was trying to do what I assume is a common exercise (exercise II 5.5.3 of Hartshorne): Let $X = \text{Spec }A$ be an affine scheme and show that for any $A$-module $M$ and any sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$, there is a natural isomorphism
$$
\text{Hom}_{A} \left( M , \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F}) \right) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}} \left( \widetilde{M}, \mathcal{F} \right).
$$
In other words, show that the global section functor and the twidlification functor are an adjoint pair. The bijection seems easy enough. It's the naturality that is making it hard. I really wanted to use Yoneda's lemma here, so I tried that but ended up coming to a conclusion that (I think?) is absurd. This was my attempt: Fix a sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-modules $\mathcal{F}$. Define the functors
\begin{align}
h_{\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})} &:= \text{Hom}_{A} \left( -, \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})   \right) \\
G(-) &:= \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}} \left( \widetilde{-} , \mathcal{F}    \right)
\end{align}
Then Yoneda's lemma tells us that there is a natural isomorphism (as functors into the category of sets)
$$
\text{Nat} \left( h_{\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})} , G  \right) \simeq \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}} \left( \Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})\tilde{\,} , \mathcal{F} \right).
$$
This is where I became confused. The above line seems to be suggesting that there can only exist a natural isomorphism between the functors $h_{\Gamma(X, \mathcal{F})}$ and  $G $ if $\mathcal{F}$ is quasi-coherent. But then the exercise asks to show that this adjunction holds in the entire ambient category of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$-modules. My guess is that I have misunderstood how to apply Yoneda's lemma here. In fact, I used it here specifically because I wanted some practice with applying it. Can Yoneda's lemma be used for this exercise at all? If so, where have I gone wrong? As an aside: Does anyone have some general advice for learning and understanding adjoint functors and Yoneda's lemma well, particularly being able to show that two functors are adjoint? This is one concept that I keep struggling with despite coming to grips with other content in algebraic geometry. I've added a tag for soft question for this last remark/question.","['quasicoherent-sheaves', 'algebraic-geometry', 'adjoint-functors', 'affine-schemes', 'soft-question']"
2485498,"Mentally generating a (pseudo)random {0,1}-sequence with uniform distribution","I want to learn of good ways by which to generate $\{0,1 \}$ -sequences in my head which are (pseudo)random with uniform distribution, so that I may simulate flipping a fair two-sided, standard coin. I want to do this because sometimes, I need to pick an option randomly, but I have no equipment (such as a coin or a random number generator) handy - and I am scared of having cognitive biases creep in. The trick/constraints in this challenge include(s): the fact that I am not an exceptionally skilled mental calculator and I may need to generate these numbers under pressure or quickly; I want the sequence (if it is pseudorandom) to have a fairly large period so that I can generate values many times in the same situation (say, in order to make several consecutive decisions over the course of a few seconds or minutes) without falling into an apparent pattern. I may add other constraints too. But the basic idea is that the method needs to be robust and versatile, but also reasonable in human situations. And, of course, it has to be free of cognitive biases or other failings, except for calculation accuracy and possibly choosing the initial values. Bonus points if it generalizes easily to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ -sequences for small $n$ , such that the method is still easy (etc.) to use Thank you very much","['random', 'probability', 'mental-arithmetic', 'random-variables']"
2485514,Function being equal on infinitely many points implies it's constant?,"I have the following problem and solution given in my textbook: Does there exist a nonconstant function $f : (1,∞) → \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the relation $f(x)= f(\frac{x^2+1}{2} )$ for all $x>1$ and such that $lim_{x\rightarrow \infty}f(x)$exists? For $x>1$ deﬁne the sequence $(x_n)n≥0$ by $x_0 = x$ and $x_{n+1} = x^2_{n}+1/2$ , $n ≥ 0$. The sequence is increasing because of theAM–GM inequality. Hence it has a limit L, ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Passing to the limit in the recurrence relation, we obtain $L^2 -2L +1 = 0$ ; hence either $L =1$ or $L =∞$. Since the sequence is increasing, $L ≥ x0 > 1$, so $L =∞$. We therefore have $f(x)= f(x_0) = f(x_1) = f(x_2) =···= lim_{n→∞} f(x_n) = lim_{x→∞} f(x)$. This implies that $f$ is constant, which is ruled out by the hypothesis. So the answer to the question is negative. I am having trouble with the last part, why does the values that the function takes on at a certain set of points imply it is constant for all points because in general, this is not true.","['sequences-and-series', 'functions', 'proof-explanation']"

The goal is to achieve simpler/easy to understand approaches as well as to minimize the calculations involved. The method in my comment is based on Ramanujan's series $$\frac{4}{\pi}=\frac{1123}{882}-\frac{22583}{882^{3}}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1\cdot 3}{4^{2}}+\frac{44043}{882^{5}}\cdot\frac{1\cdot 3}{2\cdot 4}\cdot\frac{1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7}{4^{2}\cdot 8^{2}}-\dots\tag{1}$$ This is quite hard to understand (at least in my opinion, see the blog posts to convince yourself) but achieves the goal of minimal calculations with evaluation of just the first term being necessary.

$$\frac\pi4=1-\frac13+\frac15-\cdots\tag2$$
But this requires a large number of terms to get any reasonable accuracy. I would like a happy compromise between the two and approaches based on other ideas apart from series are also welcome. A previous question of mine gives an approach to estimate the error in truncating the Leibniz series $(2)$ and it gives bounds for $\pi$ with very little amount of calculation. However it requires the use of continued fractions and proving the desired continued fraction does require some effort. Another set of approximations to $\pi$ from below are obtained using Ramanujan's class invariant $g_n$ namely $$\pi\approx\frac{24}{\sqrt{n}}\log(2^{1/4}g_n)\tag{3}$$ and $n=10$ gives the approximation $\pi\approx 3.14122$ but this approach has a story similar to that of equation $(1)$.","['real-analysis', 'inequality', 'sequences-and-series', 'pi', 'upper-lower-bounds']"
2485563,Cutting a multiple twisted Möbius strip in half,"At my workplace in the weekends we ususally play around with science and younger children. This months topic in mathemathics was a bit of soft topology. We of course made Möbius strips. What we called $\mathbf{a \ twist}$ was a $180^{\circ}$ rotation of the end of the strip before glueing. So $0$ twist is a ring of paper, $1$ twist gives the Möbius strip $2$ strips gives again an orientable surface (basically the ring ""going around twice"") and so on. I just wanted to clarify our terminology. After we understood what the word orientable means we of course started to cut the strips in half. The ring, cut along the centerline gave two similar rings, the Möbius strip gave a longer $4$ times twisted strip which is orientable. We understood why this happened (that is where the seemingly extra $3$ twists are coming from and why it resulted in one longer, connected strip). Some started cutting this again and we saw that we got two linked orientable surfaces. We also tried to cut the Möbius strip a bit off from the centerline and understood the result and why are the two resulting strips are linked. One thing we could't wrap our heads around is why, the $3$ times twisted strip ended up having a knot (a usual overhead knot)? We tried $5$ times twisted ones as well and we got more interesting looking knots on the strip. I learned some undergraduate level topology at university but I have a hard time connecting that knowledge to this phenomena. I searched a bit here at MSE and found really helpful information altough nothing about this ""knot story"". Could anyone explain this to me to some extent?

2486039,What is the SOP for proving inequalities by Mean Value Theorem?,"For example, for $x>0$, $1+x<e^x$. I know the proof of this is to apply MVT to $e^x$($x>0$), and one gets $e^x-e^0=e^{\xi}x$, where $\xi$ is between $0$ and $x$, then $\frac{e^x-1}{x}=e^{\xi}>1$, hence $1+x<e^x$ for all $x>0$. However, I always feel frustrated when doing such problem. First, how do we know that we should apply MVT to the function $e^x$? By what clues or signs? I had tried to apply MVT at $F(x)=e^x-(1+x)$, but can't deduce any meaningful things. Second, how do we know that we should pick the reference point at $0$? Also, I don't know how to solve $x>\ln(1+x)$ for all $x>0$. Do there exist a SOP(Standard Operating Procedures) or thinking routine to such questions? And on the other hand, how do you know that such questions are NOT related to the usage of Taylor expansions(I mean for order higher than $1$), while some questions must use Taylor expansions? For me, when facing the question $1+x<e^x$, I may also want to try the way 
 rewriting $e^x=1+x+\frac{1}{2}x^2+\frac{e^{\xi}}{3!}x^3$ as Taylor expansion, but this appears not help to solve the question. However, let's see another problem, proving $1+(1/2)x-(1/8)x^2<\sqrt{1+x}$ for all $x>0$ requires the Taylor expansions(but not MVT this time!!). How to distinguish them? (Also note that proving $\sin(x) \ge x-\frac{x^3}{6}$ requires MVT but not Taylor...) These questions frustrated me a lot. Need your help.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'taylor-expansion']"

2486131,Prove that two definitions of Separable Processes are equivalent,"In a number of sources eg (Doob 1950 Stochastic Processes), the definition of a separable stochastic process is as follows: A random process $ X(t), t \in \mathbb{R} $ is separable if there exists a countable set $ D \subset \mathbb{R} $ and a fixed event $ N $ for which $ \mathbb{P}(N) = 0 $, such that for any closed interval $ B \subset \mathbb{R}$ and open interval $ I \subset \mathbb{R} $ the two sets

    differ by a subset of $ N. $ Billingsley uses the follow definition: A random process $ X(t), t \in \mathbb{R} $ is separable if there exists a countable set $ D \subset \mathbb{R} $ such that (with probability 1) for each $ t \in \mathbb{R}$ there exists a sequence $ t_1, t_2, \dots $ such that

	t_n \in D,\quad  t_n \longrightarrow t, \quad x(t_n) \longrightarrow x(t).

If $\alpha$ is a smooth differential $n$-form defined on an $(n+1)$-dimensional compact oriented manifold with boundary, then we have $$\int_Md\alpha=\int_{\partial M}\alpha.$$ In physics, one considers a generalized form of this equation, where the manifold need not be compact, and the differential form need not be smooth everywhere; it may have poles. For example, in electrostatics one sees a 2-form field generated by a point charge $Q$
$$E=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^3}\left(x\,dy\wedge dz+y\,dz\wedge dx+z\,dx\wedge dy\right)=\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}d\Omega_{S^2},$$
where $d\Omega_{S^2}$ is the volume form of the sphere.  I suppose this must be understood as a distribution-valued form, because the physicist computes $$dE=\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\delta^3(r)\,d\text{vol}_{\mathbb{R}^3},$$ where $\delta^3$ is the Dirac delta function in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Perhaps this is a weak exterior derivative ? The physics discussions I have seen justify this computation by saying it is necessary to make the Gauss's law hold. But where I come from, we don't conspire to ensure theorems hold because we like them, but rather prove from the definitions that theorems follow logically.

2486425,Probability in exam (Possibly binomially distributed),"Question There are $6$ questions on an exam which in each of them has two options to choose from. Each correct answer will result in 1 point. The well prepared student has a probability of $90\%$ of getting a correct answer from each question. The lazy student who has not prepared for the exam will pick a choice randomly on each question. Approximately 2/3 of all students are well prepared. (a) What is the probability that the well prepared student gets 3 points from the exam ? (b) What is the probability that the randomly picked student receives 3 points from the exam ? Attempt to solve: Now i would make assumption that this is binomially distributed. Binomial distribution would be defined as: $$ Pr(k;n,p)=Pr(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} $$ We mark well prepared students with random variable $X$ Parameters $P$ = probability for getting a single question correct. $n$ = number of total points from the exam. $k$ = number of points actually recieved from the exam. (a) $P=0.9 \quad$ we know this because it was provided in the question. $n=6 \quad$ 6 points is maximum from the whole exam. $k=3 \quad$ we want probability for exactly 3 points from the exam. $$Pr(X=3)=\binom{6}{3}0.9^3(1-0.9)^{6-3}$$ $$Pr(X=3) \approx 1.46 \%$$ (b) We can mark lazy students with random variable $Y$ $$Pr(Y=3)=\binom{6}{3}0.5^3(1-0.5)^{6-3}$$ $$Pr(Y=3)\approx 31.25\% $$ Now that we have probabilities for both well prepared and lazy students scoring exactly 3 points. And we know that $\frac{2}{3}$ of all students are well prepared and $\frac{1}{3}$ are lazy. We don't know exactly how many well prepared and how many lazy students attend the exam but we do know the proportions of each group. We can mark these proportions with: $A=$ Well prepared student. $B=$ Lazy student. $$A=\frac{2}{3}, \quad B=\frac{1}{3}$$ Now approximately $A*0.0146 \approx $ number of well prepared students scoring exactly 3 points from the exam. $B*0.3125 \approx $ number of lazy students scoring exactly 3 points from the exam. In our case the result will be proportional since we don't know the actual size of these groups. Groups $A$ and $B$ don't have an intersection so in a sense they are independent of each other. $$ Pr(X,Y=3 | x_i,y_i \in A+B)= (A(Pr(X=3)))+(B(Pr(Y=3)))$$ $$ Pr(X,Y=3 | x_i,y_i \in A+B)= (\frac{2}{3}*0.0146)+(\frac{1}{3}*0.3125)  $$ $$ Pr(X,Y=3 | x_i,y_i \in A+B)\approx 11.39\% $$ Now I would like to have some feedback on if my reasoning seems correct. If it isn't correct comment an alternative solution that would be highly appreciated. I have some degree of uncertainty on question (b) whether my solution is correct or not.
