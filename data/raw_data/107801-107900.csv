1543156,"Given a matrix $A$ such that $A^{\ell}$ is a constant matrix, must $A$ be a constant matrix?","This problem originates from an exercise in Richard Stanley's Algebraic Combinatorics .  The exercise in the text (Chapter 3, Exercise 2(a)) asks Let $G$ be a finite graph (allowing loops and multiple edges).  Suppose that there is some $\ell> 0$ such that the number of walks of length $\ell$ from any fixed vertex $u$ to any fixed vertex $v$ is independent of $u$ and $v$.  Show that $G$ has the same number $k$ of edges between any two vertices (including $k$ loops at each vertex. The hypothesis of the problem (that the number of walks of length $\ell$ between any two vertices is the same) tells us that the adjacency matrix $A(G)$ of $G$ raised to the $\ell$ power is a constant matrix
$$ (A(G))^{\ell} = \begin{pmatrix} c & c & \cdots & c \\ c & c & \cdots & c \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ c & c & \cdots & c \end{pmatrix} $$
for some constant $C$.  We would like to conclude that this means the adjacency matrix itself is a constant matrix (hence, the number of walks of length 1 between any two vertices is the same, i.e., the number of edges between any two vertices is the same). Update in response to comments below: In this case we also have that $A(G)$ is a symmetric matrix which would eliminate some trivial counter examples. Does this result follow from something in linear algebra?  What is the proof?  If not, is there some other approach that might be more fruitful?","['algebraic-combinatorics', 'linear-algebra', 'matrices']"

1543480,Multi-index notation confusion,"While trying to understand a proof of equivalence of norms for $H^k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ (Fourier Transforms) I came across a possible inconsistency in the multi-index notation. Can somebody please clarify it for me? It is surprisingly hard to find it explained clearly anywhere. Suppose $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and that $\alpha = (\alpha_1,...,\alpha_n)$ is a multi-index. In lines with the multi-index notation we have $x^{\alpha} = x_{1}^{\alpha_1}...x_{n}^{\alpha_n}$. But then what is $|x^{\alpha}|^2$? If we were to be consistent then $|x^{\alpha}|^2 = |x_{1}^{\alpha_1}...x_{n}^{\alpha_n}|^2$, but that's not what is meant in this scenario, right? Here $|x^{\alpha}|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^{\alpha_i})^2$ or something like this, as with $|x|^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 $ See this question for some reference: Sobolev spaces fourier norm equivalence or Evans book on PDEs, Theorem 8, page 297, which is exactly about proving this result. I am perhaps completely in the dark about the problem and simply there is here a mixture of a notational confusion plus me not understanding the proof.

1543553,Problem with units in number field,"Edit:There were several major mistakes by my side this post, most of which have been accounted for.Now, after editing these out, the post seems to have no purpose at all.Nevertheless, it feels wrong to delete it, so I am going to leave it as it is. Consider the splitting field of $$x^3-2$$ which is $$K=Q(\alpha,\omega),$$ where alpha is the real cube root of 2 and omega is a primitive third root of unity.One can check that in fact $$K=Q(\alpha+\omega).$$ The galois group of K over Q is isomorphic to $$Z_2\times Z_3$$ and is abelian, so , by the Kronecker-Weber theorem, lies in a cyclotomic field, the smallest of which is dependent on the conductor of K. EDIT This in fact is wrong, the galois group of this extension is nonabelian, so K doesn't lie in a cyclotomic field. I was trying to solve $$a^3+2b^3+4c^3=1$$ in integers, which is the norm of an element of the form $$a+b\alpha+c\alpha^2.$$EDIT The norm is actually $$a^3+2b^3+4c^3-6abc$$Let $$O_K$$ be the ring of integers, so $$Z(\alpha,\omega)$$ is contained in it.By Dirichlet's unit theorem, the ring of integers is generated by 2 elements.EDIT the fundamental units can be found here: http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/gradnumthy/unittheorem.pdf The diophantine equation seems to have a lot of solutions:(1,0,0),(5,-4,1),(-1,1,0) etc.So to solve this, we have to see when an element of the previous form is a product of powers of the two units.But the fundamental units look terrifying, so maybe this won't be a very fruitful process.

1543578,Is every closure of a metric space a completion?,"I know that every completion is a closure of a metric space, since every convergent sequence is cauchy and  and the limit of that sequence will exist within the completion. At the same time, from my understanding, every cauchy sequence will bunch closer together and get arbitrarily close to something, but it is just a question as to whether or not that element it gets closer to actually exists in the space. This leads me to the question as to whether every closure of a metric space is a completion, because we would just be adding the limits to sequences which exist outside of the original space, including the limits of nonconvergent cauchy sequences. So is there an example of a closure which is not a completion? Or are these notions  equivalent?","['complete-spaces', 'cauchy-sequences', 'real-analysis']"
1543614,How to simplify a complex expression involving trig functions?,"Specifically (it wouldn't fit into the question title), I'm trying to figure out how to turn $$\frac{-2v^2}{a^2} \cdot \sin({\arctan({\frac{vt}{a}}})) \cdot \cos^3(\arctan(\frac{vt}{a}))$$ into $$\frac{-2v^3 \cdot a \cdot t}{(a^2+v^2t^2)^2}$$ Where $v$ and $a$ are constants and $t$ is the independent variable. Wolfram Alpha tells me the two expression are indeed equivalent, but I can't seem to turn the first one into the second one algebraically. My thinking was,  $\arctan({\frac{vt}{a}})$ gives me the angle $x$ such that $\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = \frac{vt}{a}$, so shouldn't $\sin(x) = vt$ and $\cos(x)=\frac{1}{a}$? But that doesn't give me the right result, and I can see a flaw in that thinking because $\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = \frac{vt}{a}$ just gives use the ratio of $\sin(x)$ to $\cos(x)$, and we can't deduce from that the actual values of $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$.

So, for some $s<t$, I need $\tilde{W}_t-\tilde{W}_s \sim N(0,t-s)$.
I simply substituted $\{W_t\}$ to end up with $W_{t+r}-W_{s+r}$. I managed showing the mean $\mu=0$ for this random variable. I am confused with the variance. I think I am doing some very fundamental error but I don't see where. So I need $\text{Var}[W_{t+r}-W_{s+r}]$. 
I understand the definition of variance to be, $\mathbb{E}[X^2]-\mu^2$. Now I showed that $\mu=0$ for our random variable so essentially, I need to compute, $$\mathbb{E}[(W_{t+r}-W_{s+r})^2]$$ By expansion, I obtain $\mathbb{E}[W_{t+r}^2-2W_{t+r}W_{s+r}+W_{s+r}^2]$ and by linearity, 
$$\mathbb{E}[W_{t+r}^2]-2\mathbb{E}[W_{t+r}W_{s+r}]+\mathbb{E}[W_{s+r}^2]$$ By independence, the middle term disappears and I am left with $\mathbb{E}[W_{t+r}^2]+\mathbb{E}[W_{s+r}^2]$. Since $W_t$ is a Brownian Motion, the expression I have is simply the sum of each variance, so $\mathbb{E}[W_{t+r}^2]+\mathbb{E}[W_{s+r}^2]=(t+r)+(s+r)$. Which clearly doesn't give me $t-s$.

1543660,Riemann Zeta Function integral,"I was reading about the Riemann Zeta Function when they mentioned the contour integral $$\int_{+\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{(-x)^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} dx$$ where the path of integration ""begins at $+\infty$, moves left down the positive real axis, circles the origin once in the positive (counterclockwise) direction, and returns up the positive real axis to $+\infty$."" They specified that $(-x)^{s-1} = e^{(s-1)\log(-x)}$ so that $\log(-x)$ is real when x is a negative real number. Furthermore, $\log(-x)$ is undefined when x is a positive real number as a result of this choice of $\log$. They proceeded to evaluate the integral by splitting it into $$\int_{+\infty}^{\delta}\frac{(-x)^{s-1}}{e^x - 1}dx + \int_{|x|=\delta}\frac{(-x)^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} dx + \int_{\delta}^{+\infty}\frac{(-x)^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} dx$$

I think if we randomly take $(\lambda-\lambda') t$ of the jumps and remove them, we obtain another renewal process with rate $\lambda'$ because: 1. since we choose the jumps randomly, the pdf of the jumps will remain identical 2. since each removing of a jump means replacing the two consequent jumps $x_i,x_{i+1}$ by their sum $x_i+x_{i+1}$ that is independent to other elements of $x$ .

1544008,Quotient of nilpotent group is nilpotent,"Edit: I managed to rephrase my proof in a way that does not resort to coset multiplication. I think the resulting proof is better. I've added it as an answer below, while preserving the original question to avoid wrecking the context. In his book Finite Group Theory , section 1.D, Isaacs mentions without proof the following result: Proposition 1: If $G$ is a nilpotent group and $H \lhd G$, then $G/H$ is nilpotent. I think I have a proof but would appreciate confirmation and any suggestions for improvement. Isaacs' definition is that $G$ is nilpotent if it has a central series: $G$ is nilpotent if it has a central series, meaning that there are subgroups $N_i \lhd G$ such that $1 = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq \cdots \leq N_r = G$ and $N_i / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. I would like to work directly with this definition rather than with upper or lower central series. The reasons for this: (1) Isaacs' treatment of upper central series assumes that the group is finite, and uses the result I am trying to prove in order to establish the equivalence between ""$G$ has a central series"" and ""$G$ has an upper central series which reaches $G$""; (2) lower central series are not covered until a later chapter. Initially I tried to prove this by defining $M_i = N_i H / H$ and attempting to show that this results in a central series. I think I made it work using a somewhat messy argument involving the isomorphism and correspondence theorems, but then it occurred to me that instead it suffices to prove the following result: Proposition 2: If $G$ is nilpotent and $\phi : G \to H$ is an epimorphism, then $H$ is nilpotent. Then we can apply this to the canonical epimorphism $\phi : G \to G/H$ given by $\phi(g) = gH$, which gives the desired result. Proof: We have $N_i \lhd G$ and $1 = N_0 \leq N_1 \leq \cdots \leq N_r = G$, with $N_i / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. The latter condition can be stated equivalently as follows: if $n \in N_i$ and $g \in G$, then $ngN_{i-1} = gnN_{i-1}$. Now define $M_i = \phi(N_i)$ for every $0 \leq i \leq r$. Note that $M_0 = \phi(N_0) = \phi(1) = 1$, and $M_r = \phi(N_r) = \phi(G) = H$. Also, $M_i \lhd H$ by the correspondence theorem since $N_i \lhd G$. Now, let $m \in M_i$ and $h \in H$. To show that $M_i / M_{i-1} \leq Z(H / M_{i-1})$, it suffices to show that $mhM_{i-1} = hmM_{i-1}$. We have $m = \phi(n)$ and $h = \phi(g)$ for some $n \in N_i$ and $g \in G$. Then $mhM_{i-1} = \phi(ngN_{i-1}) = \phi(gnN_{i-1}) = hmM_{i-1}$, where the second equality holds because $N_{i} / N_{i-1} \leq Z(G / N_{i-1})$. We conclude that $1 = M_0 \leq M_1 \leq \cdots\leq M_r = H$ is a central series for $H$, so $H$ is nilpotent.","['abstract-algebra', 'group-theory', 'proof-verification', 'nilpotent-groups']"

The toy case I tried is $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$. But in this case it looks to be trivial. Because any $F$ on $\mathbb{P}^1$ is a direct sum of line bundles of the same degree. So the pull back will also be a direct sum of line bundles with same slope, and hence will be semistable.

When you rack the balls it has the specific set up in the picture where the 8 ball must be in that central position and the balls are laid out either as in the picture OR the opposite way round, i.e. the reds take the yellow's positions. When you set up the game you generally place all the balls in a triangle and then rearrange them into the correct set up positions. We wondered what would be the least amount of moves it would take to get to the correct set up from a random starting position. We define a move here as swapping the position of two balls. My thoughts are that the upper bound is 4 moves. In the worst case scenario, you can guarantee at least 6 balls in incorrect positions regardless of whether you choose the set up in the picture or the opposite set up where the reds take the yellow's positions. Two colours must be the same in the two top right positions, so placing one of each colour in those positions guarantees one incorrect placement. Using the same logic for other positions (such as the striped lines in the bottom left) and placing the 8 ball away from the centre, the second picture shows a starting position guaranteeing 6 incorrect balls. I suspect you can now place the remaining balls arbitrarily and the least number of moves will depend on which colour is in the 8 ball's position. I think that that swap should also determine whether you should choose the set up in the first picture or the opposite set up, but I can't quite formalise this.

1544458,Proving that there's no translation invariant measure on the power set of $\mathbb{R}$,"The goal of this task given to me is to show that there is no (non-trivial) translation invariant measure on $P(\mathbb{R})$, the power set of $\mathbb{R}$, and I think I almost completed it, but I just can't find a way to prove the very last bit that's missing. But let's start at the beginning. Let $\mu: P(\mathbb{R}) \to [0, â]$ be a measure that satisfies the following conditions: $(*) \mu([0, 1]) = 1$ and $\mu(x + A) = \mu(A)$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}, A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. The assignment asks me to consider the equivalence relation $x \sim y :<=> x - y \in \mathbb{Q}$ Out of every equivalence class, we choose a representative $x \in [0, 1]$. Let $X \subseteq [0, 1]$ be the set of representatives that we got that way. I am now to consider the sets $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$ and $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)$, and find a contradiction by showing that $\mu$ would need to satisfy both $\mu(X) = 0$ aswell as $\mu(X) > 0$. What I've shown so far: I showed that $\mu(\mathbb{R}) = â$ (using the fact that $[0, 1]$ is sent to $1$), aswell as that $\mu(\{a\}) = 0$ for all $a \in \mathbb{R}$. From this, it also follows that all countable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are sent to $0$ by $\mu$ (so especially $\mu(\mathbb{Q}) = 0$). I've also shown that, since $\mu(\cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)) = â$ and since $\cup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (X + q)$ is a countable, disjoint union, we have that $\mu(X) > 0$. The only part I'm still missing is to show that $\mu(X) = 0$ via the fact that $\mathbb{R} = \cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$, as written above. I just can't get my head around how I could show this. $\cup_{x \in X} (x + \mathbb{Q})$ is a disjoint, but uncountable union because $X$ contains uncountably many elements; therefore, we can't use the $\sigma$-additivity of a measure. I see that $\mu(x + \mathbb{Q}) = 0$ for each $x \in X$, because $\mathbb{Q})$ is countable, but I don't know how that helps me. I've also thought about decomposing $[0,1]$ into a disjoint union of sets, but that didn't lead anywhere so far. If we ""remove"" countably many points of $[0,1]$, the remaining set would still be sent to $1$ by $\mu$, for the reasons given above. So how could I conclude that $X$ must be sent to $0$? I'm out of ideas.","['analysis', 'real-analysis', 'measure-theory']"

1544464,"Set all measurable real functions on $[0,1]$ with metric $\int_{0}^1 \min \{1,|f(t)âg(t)|\}dt$ is FrÃ©chet without nonzero continuous linear functional","Bounty Edit: In the following, all the questions will be highlighted by a bold number and a text written in italics. I found the following statement in a book, and I am really struggling to see why it is true. The set of all measurable real functions on $[0,1]$, metrized via the map $$(f,g)\mapsto \int_{0}^1 \min \{1,|f(t)âg(t)|\}dt,$$ is a FrÃ©chet space on which there is no nonzero continuous linear functional. (Even the linear functional $f\mapsto f(0)$ is not continuous on this space). Regarding the very last statement in braces, I should have a proof of it. Attempted Proof: Let $f=0$, i.e. for every $x \in [0,1], f(x) = 0$, and define $f_n$ as
  $$ f_n (x):=
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{ if } x \in [0, \frac{1}{n}],\\
0, & \text{ if } x \in (\frac{1}{n}, 1].\\
\end{cases}$$
  To see that $f_n \to f$, notice that, for an arbitrary $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we have
  $$ \begin{align*} d(f_n , f) &= \int_{0}^1 | f_n (t) - f(t) | \ dt \\
&\leq \int_{0}^1 | f_n (t)| + |f(t) | \ dt \\ 
&= \int_{0}^1 | f_n (t)|\ dt  + \int_{0}^1 |f(t) | \ dt \\
&= \int_{0}^1 | f_n (t)|\ dt \to 0 \end{align*} $$
  However, $f_n(0) \nrightarrow f(0)$, because for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $f_n (0) =1$, while $f(0)=0$. Concerning it, here there is my first question : 1) Is the way in which I wrote the proof correct? Regarding the main statement, the things that have to be proved are two: a) $\mathcal{M}$ (that denotes the set of all measurable functions on $[0,1]$) is a FrechÃ©t space (complete metric linear space); b) there are no nonzero continuous linear functionals on $\mathcal{M}$. Related to part (b) I found in Rudin's ""Functional Analysis"" (pp.36-37, section 1.47) a proof that the space $L^p$
with $0 < p <1$ behaves in the same way. Moreover, on the wikipedia page on locally convex TVS I found that there is still another space that behaves similarly, namely $L_0$, i.e. the set of all measurable functions with distance function $$d(f,g):= \int_{0}^1 \frac{|f(x) - g(x)|}{1+|f(x)-g(x)|}dx.$$ Thus, here there are my other questions . 2) Is it possible to prove part (a) in different ways, namely one less constructive, and another one more constructive, with an actual $f \in \mathcal{M}$ to which an arbitrary Cauchy sequence $(f_n) \subseteq \mathcal{M}$ converge? If yes, how? 3) Is it possible to prove part (b) by showing that $\mathcal{M}$ is homeomorphic to $L_0$, which is homeomorphic to $L^p$ with $0 < p <1$, and then exploiting Rudin's proof? Are all those spaces actually homeomorphic? If yes, how? 4) If they are not homeomorphic, and we cannot use Rudin's proof, essentially, how do we prove the result, namely part (a) and part (b)? I am looking forward to any answer, because being self-thaught I am having some real problems concerning this result, and I have the feeling that grasping this proof (with the techniques involved) would help me a lot.

For part a), I just thought of it like this... first die of any color can be placed anywhere and the die of the same color has a 1/3 chance of being placed with it. The second color die can be placed in 2 of the remaining urns (2/3) and the other same colored die needs to be placed in that urn as well (1/3), the final colored die need to be placed in the last remaining urn so (1/3) and the second die of that color needs to be placed in that urn as well (1/3).

1544640,Theoretical link between the graph diffusion/heat kernel and spectral clustering,"The graph diffusion kernel of a graph is the exponential of its Laplacian $\exp(-\beta L)$ (or a similar expression depending on how you define the kernel). If you have labels on some vertices, you can get labels on the rest of the vertices by a majority vote of adding the kernel contribution. In spectral clustering, the sign of the eigenvector components of the largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian determines the class assignment of the vertices. Since these techniques seem to be doing similar things based on the graph Laplacian, is there a link between spectral clustering and the diffusion or heat kernel? Is one the generalization of the other under some assumptions? What I have found so far: The paper ""The Principal Components Analysis of a Graph,
and Its Relationships to Spectral Clustering"" by Saerens et al. seems to say something about this. They say that one flavor of the diffusion kernel (the Euclidean Commute Time Distance) is the same as one type of spectral clustering. The paper ""Diffusion Maps, Spectral Clustering and Eigenfunctions of Fokker-Planck Operators"" by Nadler et al. also has a result that I am yet to parse. Following ""Graph spectral image smoothing using the heat kernel"" by Zhan and Hancock, we can observe that if the Laplacian $L = USU^T$, (with $U$ as the eigenvectors and $S$ the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues)  and the heat kernel is $H=\exp(-\beta L)$, then $H = Uexp(-\beta S)U^T$. So for some $\beta$ we just have to take the smallest eigenvalue to get the approximate $H$.

1544800,Curvature measure for polygones on a 2D space,"I would like to implement a curvature measure for polygones on a 2D space. My goal is to compute shape parameters to know if the polygon is close to a circle or has a sinuous shape or an elongated shape... I already try to fit to various shapes, compute parameters based on length, area or perimeter so I would rather focus on angles or curvatures but both inspiration and Google failed me. I already have a measure based on perimeter to area ratio which is probably very correlated to a mean radius of curvature, I am looking for a different perspective. I know a curvature measure for continuous functions (defined here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature#Curvature_of_a_graph ). That would probably be interesting if I could see how to implement it for a polygone with discontinuous derivatives at summits. I can imagine something similar to an energy cost that would penalize narrow angles, concavities... But I don't see how to translate it mathematically. I would be glad if you have ideas or precise measure definitions I could apply to this problem. Thank you.","['geometry', 'polygons', 'curvature']"

\frac{d^\beta}{d\alpha^\beta}\frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha}\sin(x)

$ I think it is equal to $\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^\beta \sin\left(x+\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\alpha+\beta\right)\right)$, but i am absolutely not sure if this is true. Thank you, Best regards Kevin -edit- Here is the desription how i got my result (which maybe helps to verify it): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differintegral#A_selection_of_basic_formul.C3.A6 $$\Rightarrow \frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha}\sin(x)=\sin(x+\alpha\frac{\pi}{2})$$ Because $\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(ax)=a^nf^{\left(n\right)}(ax), n\in \mathbb{N}$ i think $\frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha}f(ax)=a^\alpha f^{\left(\alpha\right)}(ax), \alpha\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is also true. Unfortunately i'm not sure if this is true. Because $\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x+a)=f^{\left(n\right)}(x+a), n\in\mathbb{N}$ is true, i also hope that $\frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha}f(x+a)=f^{\left(\alpha\right)}(x+a), \alpha\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is true. With these new rules the expression can be calculated:
$$
\frac{d^\beta}{d\alpha^\beta}\frac{d^\alpha}{dx^\alpha}\sin(x)
$$
$$
=\frac{d^\beta}{d\alpha^\beta}\sin(x+\alpha\frac{\pi}{2})
$$
$$
=\frac{d^\beta}{d\alpha^\beta}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\alpha+\frac{2}{\pi}x\right))
$$
This is just a shifted $\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma)$.
$$
\gamma=\alpha+\frac{2}{\pi}x
$$
$$
\Rightarrow\frac{d^\beta}{d\alpha^\beta}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma)
$$
$$
=\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{\beta}\sin^{\left(\beta\right)}(\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma)

$$
=\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{\beta}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\gamma+\frac{\pi}{2}\beta)
$$
$$
=\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^{\beta}\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\alpha+\frac{2}{\pi}x\right)+\frac{\pi}{2}\beta)

1544822,Is it possible for this function on $R^2$ to be defined continuously at $0$?,"I wont post all the functions.I am practicing on continuity.So i wanna use definitions but i am not really sure how? Suppose i have the function $$f(x)= \frac{x^4-y^4}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$$ When $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ and $f(x)=b $ when $(x,y)=(0,0)$ Proof:To be defined continouesly at $0$ the limit at zero must exist.So there must exist the $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^4-y^4}{(x^2+y^2)^2} $$ Or if i do a variables change to polar coordinates  $x=rcosÎ¸ $  $y=rsinÎ¸$
 then$$\lim_{(r,Î¸)\to(0,0)} cos^2Î¸-sin^2Î¸ $$ but that function does not depend on $r$  and so will give the same limit for All $r's$ since it must be unique?. So i said the function cannot be defined continuously .Is it right?Does not seem that rigorous to me i think i need a better explanation as to why it might not be defined and why when it is not depended on both variables it doesnt work.

1544887,Line Integrals with Vector Fields,"I am trying to find the line integral of the vector field $F(x,y)=(x^2-y^2)$ x $-2xy$ y from $(0,0)$ to $(1,2)$ along a few different paths. First path is along curve $y=2x^2$ Second path is curve described by $x=t^2$ and $y=2t$ Last path is the path that goes from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$ along the x-axis and then along line $(2,0)$ to $(1,2)$. This is what I have so far. For the first one: $$\int F(x,y)\cdot dr=\int ((x^2-y^2)+(-2xy)4t)  dt$$ I said $r(t)=x(t)$ x + $y(t)$ y . Therefore $dr=(1$ x +$4t$ y )dt. This part is algebra and derivatives. Thus by setting $x=t$ and $y=2x^2=2t^2$, we can solve the integral as follows: $$\int_0^1 (t^2-4t^4-16t^4)dt=\frac{-31}{15}$$ For the second one: Same process, but this time, $r(t)=t^2$ x +$2t$ y . Therefore, $dr=(2t$ x +$2$ y )$dt$. Now the integral becomes
$$\int F(x,y)\cdot dr=\int ((x^2-y^2)t^2+(-2xy)2)  dt$$ Now with substituting for $x$ and $y$, $$\int_0^1 (2t^5-8t^3+8t^3)dt=\frac{1}{3}$$ For the last one: I broke this up first along the x-axis then along the line $y=-2x+4$. Now we have $$\int F_x dx+\int F \cdot dr=\int_0^1(x^2-y^2)dx+\int_2^1((x^2-y^2)+2xy*-2)dx$$
I found out that $dy=-2$ since the line from $(2,0)$ to $(1,2)$. So for the first integral, y=0, but the second one, $y=-2x+4$. Thus left with $$\int_0^1(x^2-0^2)dx+\int_2^1((x^2-(-2x+4)^2)+2x(-2x+4)*-2)dx=\frac{-11}{3}$$","['line-integrals', 'calculus', 'integration', 'vectors', 'multivariable-calculus']"
