363261,Confusion regarding the derivation of $\cos(x)$ when differentiating $\sin(x)$,"The textbook I'm reading derives it like this: $\eqalign{
  & y = \sin x \Rightarrow \left( 1 \right)  \cr 
  & y + \delta y = \sin (x + \delta x) \Rightarrow (2) \cr} $ Subtracting equation (1) from (2): $\eqalign{
  & y + \delta y - y = \sin (x + \delta x) - \sin x  \cr 
  & \delta y = \sin (x + \delta x) - \sin x  \cr 
  &  = 2\cos (x + {1 \over 2}\delta x)\sin \left({1 \over 2}\delta x\right) \cr} $ Without completing the whole ""proof"" I can tell you where I am confused. $\delta y = \sin (x + \delta x) - \sin x$ to this: $2\cos (x + {1 \over 2}\delta x)\sin \left({1 \over 2}\delta x\right)$ What happened here? It looks like the double angle identity was used?
Isn't the double angle formula used for when two angles are the same? I know dx is very small, but still, the value of x has been altered so shouldn't the ""angle addition"" identity be used instead? Further more what happened to the -sin(x)? How was it incorporated into $2\cos (x + {1 \over 2}\delta x)\sin \left({1 \over 2}\delta x\right)$ ? This is confusing me quite a bit, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. EDIT: Furthermore, 1/2(dx): where does this come from?","['trigonometry', 'calculus']"

363315,Conditional Probability or Intersection - Second Problem,"The question that I asked at Is the Event a Conditional Probability or an Intersection? may be similar, but I'm confused over the following question from a different textbook. I'd be shocked if two textbooks make the same mistake! It's Example 2e on P61 and 62 in A First Course in Pr , 8th ed, by Sheldon Ross. Problem: I'm undecided as to whether to take French or chemistry. I estimate that the probability of receiving an A grade would be $\frac{1}{2}$ in French and $\frac{2}{3}$ in chemistry. If I decide based on the flip of a fair coin, what's the probability that I get an A in chemistry? Given Solution: Let $C$ be the event that I take chemistry and $A$ denote the event that I receive an A in whatever course I take. Then the desired probability is: $Pr(A \cap C) = Pr(C)Pr(A|C) = (1/2)(2/3) $ . $ \Large 1.$ Why is the probability that I get an A in chemistry $Pr(A \cap C)$ and NOT $Pr(A|C)$ ?

363393,When is there a unique solution for being equidistant to $N$ points in taxicab geometry?,"We place three non-overlapping, noncollinear points on an arbitrarily large grid graph (not worrying about infinities).  Call these points $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$.  Assuming taxicab geometry, is it possible for there to exist two or more points on the lattice, $(p_a,p_b)$, that have the same ordered set of distances to  $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$?  Does this hold true for a $d$-dimensional grid graph if we ask for an ordered set of distances to $d+1$ non-overlapping and noncollinear points (trivially true for $d = 1$)? Please notice that I specify the distances to each point should be an ordered set.  In other words, if your set of distances to $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ is $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$, this set of distances is distinct from, for example, $(d_2, d_1, d_3)$. In response to coffeemath's answer:  The example you give (scaled by a factor of 20), yields $(p_1,p_2,p_3) = ((0,0),(-20,20),(10,10))$ and $(p_a,p_b) = ((-5,15),(-4,16))$.  In taxicab geometry, we thus have $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (20,20,20)$ for both $p_a$ and $p_b$.  However, in Euclidean geometry, we have that $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (5*10^{\frac{1}{2}},5*10^{\frac{1}{2}},5*10^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for $p_a$ and $(d_1, d_2, d_3) = (4*17^{\frac{1}{2}},4*17^{\frac{1}{2}},2*58^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for $p_b$.  So the answer to my question is ""no"", a particular instance of the ordered set $(d_2, d_1, d_3)$ can exist for multiple lattice points. Followup question (while my account details are being sorted out) - Are there any simple constraints that would make my statement true?  What if we have $d+2$ points for a $d$-dimensional grid graph and ask about the uniqueness of an ordered set of these points?  What if we consider a hexagonal lattice version of taxicab geometry? Note to CoffeeMath:  Still haven't been able to fuse my account with this one, but to respond: ""...maybe the requirement should be that the n+1 points not all lie on any hyperplane (on the analogy of for 2-space requiring no three on a line (hyperplane in two space)? For highjer dimensions I think ""no three on a line"" might be too easy."" Right, I think this is a very natural extension to the ""non collinear"" constraint I imposed in 2D.  In general, we want to break any ""trivial"" axes of symmetry.  In the continuum limit, we might call this randomly perturbing the vertices of the grid graph in $R^d$.  Also, as a quick note, I never meant that additional dimensions would somehow constrain lower-dimensional embeddings of graphs.",['geometry']
363395,What to call this binary operation property?,"In one of my projects I came across a property that all the binary operations need to have to lead to correct results. It looked like a general property so I was wondering if it might have been described and named somewhere. Given a binary operation $\lozenge$ with $\lozenge:X\times Y\rightarrow X$. The property is defined by $\left(x\:\lozenge\:y_1\right)\:\lozenge\:y_2\:=\:\left(x\:\lozenge \:y_2\right)\:\lozenge\: y_1$ with $x\in X$ and $y_{1,2}\in Y$. The operation does not have to be symmetric for this property to hold. If the operator is associative and commutative this property will always hold (first use assoc. then comm. and assoc. again). But the property can also hold when both are not the case for instance with operation $x\:\square\: y\:=\: x+1$. The operation is associative nor commutative but the does have the property given above. How should I call this?","['terminology', 'group-theory']"
363421,Prove that Hermitian matrices are diagonalizable,"I am trying to prove that Hermitian Matrices are diagonalizable.

If $A=A^H;\;\;\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ be two distinct eigenvalues and $v_1,v_2$  be two eigenvectors associated with them.
$$Av_1=\lambda_1v_1\Rightarrow v_1^HAv_1=\lambda_1v_1^Hv_1\Rightarrow \lambda_1=\lambda_1^*.$$
Similarly,
$$Av_1=\lambda_1v_1\Rightarrow v_2^HAv_1=\lambda_1v_2^Hv_1\Rightarrow v_1^H\lambda_2v_2=\lambda_1v_1^Hv_2\Rightarrow v_1^Hv_2=0$$ However, I am not aware of Spectral Theorem. Given this circumstances, how can I prove that Hermitian Matrices are diagonalizable? It should follow from above but the only sufficient condition of a matrix being diagonalizable is to have $dim(A)$ distinct eigenvalues, or existance of $P$ such that $A=P^{-1}DP$. I am not sure how this follows from above conditions.","['eigenvalues-eigenvectors', 'hermitian-matrices', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'diagonalization']"
363426,Seemingly contradictional facts on whether Chern classes determine a line bundle or not.,"All varieties will be smooth when necessary. Earlier i learned that the first Chern class of a line bundle on an algebraic variety does not determine the bundle up to algebraic isomorphism, i.e. the map
$$
\alpha: \quad\operatorname{Pic}(X) \longrightarrow A^1(X)
$$
sending a line bundle to its first Chern class can have a nontrivial kernel. (isn't this kernel nonzero whenever the albanese variety is nontrivial?) (see the comments on Are vector bundles on $\mathbb{P}_{\mathbb{C}}^n$ of any rank completely classified? (main interest $n=3$) ) However, i quote from Gathmann's notes ""The top Chern class
$c_r(F)$ has the additional geometric interpretation as the zero locus of a section of $F$"". Here $F$ is a bundle of rank $r$. In the case of line bundles this is the first Chern class. I found the same statement in Zach Teitlers notes: http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=zach_teitler , see fact 10. The problem i am having is that these statements seem contradictory: it is known that a line bundle on a smooth variety is completely determined up to isomorphism by the divisor of zeroes of a section. But according to Gathmann, that is exactly its first Chern class, so Gathmann is basically saying that $c_1(\mathcal{L})$ does determine $\mathcal{L}$ up to isomorphism. Question 1: Can someone clear this contradiction up? Do Gathmann and Teitler both make the assumption that $\alpha$ is injective? Or am i missing something? (i am new to this subject!) Question 2 (probably related): Teitler explains the method of degeneracy loci to compute the Chern classes of a bundle. I have the feeling that this method needs special assumptions on the variety in order to work, that Teitler does not explain. Is this true? He does assumes projectivity, smoothness and irreducibility, are these necessary? Thanks!","['algebraic-geometry', 'vector-bundles']"

363529,Congruence between Bernoulli numbers,"I fell on the following fact as a by-product: If p is a prime number, then the sum of the Bernoulli numbers, from index 0 to p - 2, is congruent with - 1 modulo p. Do you know a simple proof ? Or a reference to the literature ? Thanks beforehand. Edit. It was not a very smart question. The congruence is an easy consequence of Bernoulli's formula for the sum of the $(p-2)$ -powers of the natural numbers from 1 to $p-2$ . Edit. As suggested by barto, I give the proof. For $p = 2$ , it is trivial, thus assume $p \geq 3$ . Bernoulli's summation formula is (for $m \geq 1$ ) : $$
(m+1) \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^m = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B_k n^{m + 1 - k}
$$ or in more detail $$
(m+1)(1^m + 2^m + \cdots + (n-1)^m) = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m + 1}{k} B_k n^{m + 1 - k}.
$$ (I use the definition with $B_1 = -1/2$ . The Wikipedia article : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number#Sum_of_powers uses the other definition, hence a slight difference.) With $n = p-1$ and $m = p-2$ , this becomes (1) $(p-1) \sum_{k=1}^{p-2} k^{p-2} = \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k}$ , where the involved Bernoulli numbers are $p$ -integral rational numbers. Now, by Fermat's little theorem, $\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k^{p-2}$ (with one more term than in the preceding sum) is modulo $p$ the sum of the inverses of the $p-1$ nonzero elements. Since inversion is a bijection, this sum is equal modulo $p$ to $\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} k = p(p-1)/2$ , which is zero modulo $p$ . Thus (1) gives $-(p-1)(p-1)^{p-2} \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k} \pmod{p}$ $-1 \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{k} B_k (p-1)^{p-1-k}\pmod{p}$ . But $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^{k} \pmod{p}$ , thus the right member is congruent modulo $p$ to $\sum_{k=0}^{p-2} B_k$ , and we are done. Edit : here is a simpler proof. It is well known that, for $m \geq 2$ , $\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \binom{m}{i} B_{i} = 0.$ Putting $m=p-1$ , we find $\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} \binom{p-1}{i} B_{i} = 0.$ Since $\binom{p-1}{k} \equiv (-1)^{k} \pmod{p}$ and the involved Bernoulli numbers are $p$ -integral rational numbers, this gives $\sum_{i=0}^{p-2} (-1)^{i} B_{i} \equiv 0 \pmod{p}.$ Now, $B_{1} = -1/2$ and for $i$ odd and $> 1$ , $B_{i} = 0$ , hence the statement.",['number-theory']

Please note that this is not homework, I am just trying the exercises.  The question is as follows: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and 
$$
f_n:X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}\hspace{10pt} n\in \mathbb{N}
$$
be a sequence of holomorphic functions which do not take the values 0 and 1. Suppose that there is a point $x_0\in X$ such that the sequence $(f_n(x_0))_n$ converges to $c\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$. Show that there is a subsequence $(f_{n_k})_k$ which converges uniformly on compact subsets of $X$ to a holomorphic function $X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$. Here is what I have tried: First off let $p:\widetilde{X}\to X$ be the universal covering of $X$ and $q:D\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$ be the universal covering of $\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$ where $D$ is the unit disk. We may assume that $\widetilde{X}$ is not biholomorphic to the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{C}_\infty$, for otherwise $X=\mathbb{C}_\infty$ and so each $f_n$ is a constant function, and then the statement is trivial. Under this assumption, $\widetilde{X}$ is biholomorphic to either $\mathbb{C}$ or to $D$. Fix a point $\widetilde{x}_0\in p^{-1}(x_0)$ and $\widetilde{c}\in q^{-1}(c)$. For each $n$ fix a $y_n\in q^{-1}(f_n(x_0))$, and we may assume for sufficiently large $n$ that these $y_n$ all lie in the same component as $\widetilde{c}$ in the preimage $q^{-1}(U)$ for some evenly covered neighborhood $U$ of $c$. Let $\widetilde{f}_n$ be the unique lift of $f_n\circ p$ such that $\widetilde{f}_n(\widetilde{x}_0)=y_n$, this can be done as $\widetilde{X}$ is simply connected. Then 
$$
\lim_n \widetilde{f}_n(\widetilde{x}_0)=\widetilde{c}.
$$
Since the codomain of each $\widetilde{f}_n$ is $D$, this sequence is uniformly bounded, and so by Montel's Theorem there is a subsequence $(\widetilde{f}_{n_k})_k$ which converge uniformly on compact subsets to a holomorphic function $\widetilde{f}:\widetilde{X}\to D$. Define a map $f:X\to \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$ by $f(x) = q\circ \widetilde{f}(\widetilde{x})$ for any $\widetilde{x}\in p^{-1}(x)$. Using the fact that the deck group acts transitively on the fibers of a universal covering and that $\widetilde{f}_{n_k}\to \widetilde{f}$ pointwise, we see that this map $f$ is well-defined. Because $p$ and $q$ are local biholomorphisms, it follows that $f$ is also holomorphic, for it can be locally expressed as $q\circ \widetilde{f}\circ p^{-1}$. Now I want to show that $f_{n_k}$ converges to $f$ uniformly on compact subsets. However, I am having a difficult time showing this. I think that I am partially on the right track, but it looks to me that I haven't used in any serious way the hypothesis that $(f_n(x_0))_n$ converges to some $c\in \mathbb{C}\setminus\{0,1\}$.

363793,Local vs. global in the definition of a sheaf,"Apologies in advance that this question is inescapably soft. What I am stuck on is squishy; I have the feeling that if I could even make it precise, I'd already be satisfied. To what extent is a sheaf determined by its stalks? Is there global information about the sheaf hiding in the stalks? Here is the story of what is bugging me. One of the first things I learned about sheaves was the sheafification of a presheaf. How I think about the sheafification is that it is the unique sheaf with the stalks dictated by the presehaf.  Thus early on I began to think of a sheaf as an object that is entirely determined by local information. There is the caveat that sections of the sheaf must come from gluing germs together ""compatibly,"" which implies that nearby stalks are talking to each other to decide what the sheaf is, but ""nearby-ness"" can be as small as it wants to in this context, so the sheaf still feels basically like a local object. (This paragraph is very vague; see below for some clarification if needed.) Now, more recently I have been studying locally free sheaves on schemes. What is bugging me is that locally free sheaves of a given rank cannot be distinguished by looking at the stalks, at least up to algebraic isomorphism. For example if $\mathscr{L}$ is an invertible sheaf, aka line bundle, on a scheme $X$ , then $\mathscr{L}_p = \mathcal{O}_{X,p}$ for every $p\in X$ , so different invertible sheaves on $X$ are not distinguished by their stalks. They are distinguished by the ways that the patches of a local trivialization of the bundle are glued together, which is a global consideration. In light of the last paragraph, how is this happening? Is it that the requirement that ""nearby germs be glued together compatibly"" to make sections allows all this global information to be stored in a local way? If so, how? Or is the argument in the previous paragraph that sheaves are determined by local information fundamentally wrong, in which case what am I missing? Anything you could tell me to help me think clearly about this situation would be much appreciated. Appendices (you can ignore, but thoughts are welcome) Clarification: Let me make explicit what I'm referring to in the paragraph above about sheafification. My definition of the sheafification is coming from Hartshorne: let $\mathscr{F}$ be a presheaf on a topological space $X$ and let $U$ be an open subset of $X$ . The sections of the sheafification of $\mathscr{F}$ over $U$ are functions $f:U\rightarrow\coprod_{p\in U}\mathscr{F}_p$ such that for all $p\in U$ , (1) $f(p)\in\mathscr{F}_p$ and (2) there exists open $V\subset U$ containing $p$ and $g\in \mathscr{F}(V)$ such that $f(q)$ equals $g$ 's germ in $\mathscr{F}_q$ for all $q\in V$ . Condition (2), about the existence of $V$ , is what I meant by ""sections come from gluing germs together compatibly."" What I meant by ""nearby-ness can be as small as it wants to"" was the fact that $V$ is an arbitrary (i.e. arbitrarily small) open neighborhood of $p$ . More thoughts: The above discussion brought to mind the monodromy theorem from complex analysis: the germ of an analytic function at a single point in a simply connected region of $\mathbb{C}$ determines the function on the whole region. However, with more thought, I feel like it cannot be something like this that is going on: let $X$ be a topological manifold and let $S,T$ be two fiber bundles on $X$ with individual fibers homeomorphic but that are not isomorphic globally.  Then the sheaves of sections should have isomorphic stalks, right? But now there is no ""rigidity"" result analogous to the monodromy theorem or anything that would happen with an algebraic vector bundle: if $p\in X$ and $U$ is any open neighborhood of $p$ no matter how small, the germ of a section at $p$ will not determine the section anywhere outside $U$ . This seems to me to free the stalks of the sheaves of sections from enmeshment with any but their closest neighbors. Yet still , the bundles will be distinguished by these sheaves! So the global information contained in the sheaves cannot be coming from some sort of rigidity theorem like the monodromy theorem or some sort of algebraic rigidity. A final thought: I was moved to post this question because I kept getting stuck at step (2) while giving myself the following exercise: (1) realize $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as the sheaf of sections of an algebraic vector bundle, described explicitly with a gluing construction, as I did in this previous question ; (2) use this explicit description to compute an equally explicit description of its dual sheaf. I keep getting stuck because I haven't been able to see how to use the gluing information when writing down the dual. I am hoping that answers to this question will lead to a general clarification of my thinking that will allow me to get past this specific stuck point for myself, but if they don't, I may ask a followup question.","['sheaf-theory', 'algebraic-geometry', 'soft-question']"

it seems, that for any natural $m \ge 2$ we get $A_m = 1 $. Even if we set $m=1$ and replace $\zeta(1)$ by the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma$ (as done by Ramanujan in his summation) and compute the multiple zetas based on this we seem to approach $1$ when the number of multiple zetas increases without bound.

$$ [update 2] The answer of @Achille Hui reminded me that it was of importance to remark that I compute the multiple zetas by the Newton-formula for the conversion between power-sums and elementary symmetric polynomials. Let $\operatorname{s2e}(v) $ be the function, which converts a vector v of powersums of consecutive exponents into a vector of elementary symmetric polynomials , then $$ \operatorname{s2e}([\zeta(m),\zeta(2  m), \zeta(3 m),\ldots])=[\zeta(m),\zeta(m,m),\zeta(m,m,m),\ldots]$$  and the alternating sum $1-A_m$ can -at least formally- be rewritten as $$1-A_m = (1-1)(1-1/2^m)(1-1/3^m)\cdots$$ as @Achille hui has pointed out. If that is a correct interpretation it is clear, that (if the product from the second term on converges for some m ) the complete result is zero for that same m . This is backed by the observation, that if I remove the first (=zero)-parenthese, and then equivalently use $\zeta(\cdot)-1$ instead of $\zeta(\cdot)$ for the powersums, then for the well converging cases we seem to get again identity. So if this is all ""waterproof"", then the question Q2 remains: Q2 : for which range of m (even from the complex numbers) do we have $1-A_m = 0$ ? (I exclude so far all m , for which it can happen with some $k \in \mathbb N$ that  $k\cdot m=1$) which simply means to avoid the occurence of $\zeta(1)$","['sequences-and-series', 'riemann-zeta', 'number-theory']"

A sketch of why this is true : If $k$ is even, this is very easy to see as the Legendre symbol goes away, so we are summing the $p^k$th roots of unity. If $k$ is odd, the way I see it is a bit less obvious: reduce the Legendre symbol to be $\left( \frac{n}{p} \right)$ so that it's $p$-periodic, write $n = pn' + n''$ fpr $0 \leq n' < p^{k-1}$ and $0 \leq n'' \leq p$. Reorder the sum to sum over the $p^{k-1}$ roots of unity first, which for $k > 1$ will still give $0$. My question is this: there are many ways of viewing Gauss sums. They can be viewed as discrete Fourier transforms, generators of quadratic extensions in $\mathbb{Q(e^{2\pi i / p})}$, as eigenfunctions, natural character sums, etc. I suspect that there is some 'obvious' or 'clear' reason why these prime power Gauss sums should be zero.

The first part of the video was very clear for me, as I understood it considers only $R^2$ dimension and points $A$ and $B$ moving along the equator and during the video we track the temperature of point $A$ and $B$ along the equator. The following is the picture from the second part. In the second part $R^3$ is considered, and instead of tracking the temperatures along the equator, we track the temperature along the arbitrary path from $A$ to $B$ along the sphere, but along this part we don't move $A$ and $B$ there is no intersection of temperatures as in was in the first part (the most confusing phrase is 4:45 ""as $A$ goes to $B$ is goes from being colder than $B$ to hotter than B"", why? it just goes to the $B$). I don't understand how the assumption that there are a point on the track where the temperature is as in the point $B$ can help us, even if it's true is  not what we need we need the temperature in the point $A$ to be equal the temperate in the point $B$. The second assumption is to consider all antipodal points with the same temperature and consider all the points on the track with the same temperature of the opposite point, so as result we have a ""club"" of the intermediate point with the different temperatures, but all their temperatures equal to the temperature of the opposite point, given so how can we connect them by the line.

Remark: By the coordinate transformation formula for multiple integrals one can compute the corresponding Jacobian to be $1$, thus the volume of $T(\Omega)$ is the same as the volume of $\Omega$, am I right? Also, geometrically, the transformation only shifts the $xy$-cross section (at each $z$ level) to an extent (along the $y$ axis), thus the area of each cross section of the cylinder $\Omega$ remains unchanged after tranformation, so the volume of $T(\Omega)$ is equal to the one of $\Omega$.

0010110011011110
$$ I've found a simple explanation of how to count the code for a sequence of bits. It says that each control bit responds for the following bits using these rules: First control bit responds for $2^n$ position and each following bit through $2^n$ . So the first bit responds for the first, third, fifth and etc. bits. The second control bit responds for 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th and etc. bits. Third control bit(which is on the 4th position) responds for 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 12th, 13th etc. bits. And so on. The value of each of the controls bits is counted as a modulo sum of the bits, which this control bit responds for. Here is an illustration of what I mean: Assuming this rule is right, the last 16th bit(after control bits addition) is not under the responsibility of any of the control bits. So the question is: How can I detect double error(only detect, not correct) for the given sequence of bits using the Hamming code?","['coding-theory', 'discrete-mathematics', 'combinatorics']"

364576,Can a function be increasing *at a point*?,"From what I understand we say that a function is increasing on an interval $I$ if $$
x_1 < x_2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad f(x_1) < f(x_2).
$$ for all $x_1,x_2\in I$ . I understand that some might call this strictly increasing and allow for equality when saying increasing . We know that when a function is differentiable on the interval $I$ , then if $f'(x) > 0$ on $I$ then $f$ is increasing on $I$ . But here we have to be careful because if $f(x) = x^3$ then $f$ indeed is increasing on $\mathbb{R}$ even though $f'(0) = 0$ . So we can't conclude that if $f$ is increasing, then $f'(x)$ must be positive on the interval. Also, even though $f(x) = x^2$ , then $f$ is increasing on $[0,\infty)$ even though $f'(0) = 0$ . My question is Does it make sense to talk about a function being increasing at a point? The only definition I can think of making is to say that $f$ is increasing at a point $a$ if $f'(a) > 0$ . But the problems with saying this is that then the function given by $f(x) = x^3$ is not increasing at $0$ even thought it is increasing on all of $\mathbb{R}$ . I am aware ( from here ) of the example with $$
f(x) = \begin{cases}x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + \frac{x}{2} & \text{if }x\neq 0 \\ 0 & \text{if } x = 0\end{cases}.
$$ This function is differentiable at $0$ with $f'(0) = \frac{1}{2} > 0$ . For $x\neq 0$ we have $f'(x) = 2x\sin(1/x) - \cos(1/x) + 1/2$ . And so for all $x_k = \frac{1}{2k\pi}$ we have $f'(\frac{1}{2k\pi}) = -\frac{1}{2} < 0$ . That is, there is not interval around $0$ where $f$ is increasing. And so it shouldn't really make sense to say that $f$ is increasing at $0$ . One example I can think of where it maybe should make sense to take about a function being increasing at a point is when when we take the derivative of function $s(t)$ that gives the position of a particle. The derivative is then the velocity $v(t) = s'(t)$ . And maybe this is just a language issue, but here it sounds reasonable saying that if $v(a)>0$ then the velocity is positive at time $t=a$ and so the rate of change is positive at $a$ . This is almost saying that the position is increasing at that point. Again, my question is just if it makes sense to talk about a function being increasing (or decreasing) at a point . If so, how is this defined?","['soft-question', 'functions', 'definition']"
364593,Varieties with the property that the cotangent bundle restricted to a complete nonsingular curve is free,"Let $X$ be a $d$-dimensional smooth projective connected variety with cotangent sheaf $\Omega^1_X$ over $\mathbb C$. Suppose that for any nonsingular complete curve $C$ and non-constant morphism $\gamma:C\to X$, we have that $$\gamma^\ast \Omega^1_X = \mathcal O_C^{\oplus d}.$$ What can we say about $X$? I know that if $X$ is an abelian variety, it has the above property. Are there any other varieties which satisfy the above property? For instance, what if the determinant of $\Omega^1_X$ is trivial, i.e., $\omega_X = \mathcal O_X$. Do we have the above property? What if $X$ is a K3 surface? (This is a special case of the above question.)","['complex-geometry', 'algebraic-geometry', 'algebraic-curves', 'arithmetic-geometry', 'k3-surfaces']"
364613,Can you raise a Matrix to a non integer number? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Arbitrary non-integer power of a matrix (3 answers) Closed 11 years ago . So I heard you can take a matrix A to the power 2, take it to a -3th power and multiply it by an irrational number. You can also do some other non-intuitive things like taking e to the power of a matrix. Does there exist some definition to take a nxn matrix to a power like 2.3 or pi?","['matrices', 'exponentiation', 'irrational-numbers']"
364620,Double conditional probability,"Is it possible to compute $P(X\mid Y,Z)$ by calculating $P(X\mid Y)$ given the probability $P(\cdot\mid Z)$? Similarly, is it possible to get at the density $f_{X\mid Y,Z}$ by calculating the desity $f_{X\mid Y}$ given $P(\cdot\mid Z)$? More precisely, let $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$ be a probability space and let $X,Y,Z$ be random variables. Consider the conditional probability induced on $\mathcal{A}$ by conditioning on $Z$: $P(\cdot\mid Z=z)$. Suppose for each $z$ we calculate the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y=y)$ in the modifed probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P(\cdot\mid Z))$. Is the resulting function of $(y,z)$ equal to the conditional distribution $P(X\mid Y=y, Z=z)$? Suppose for each $z$ the conditional density $f_{X\mid Y}$ exists given the modified probability space described above. Is the resulting function of $(y,z)$ equal to the conditional density $f_{X\mid Y,Z}$?","['probability-theory', 'conditional-probability']"
364629,Blowing up a line $L\subset \mathbb A^3$,"I am trying to understand blow-ups, so I'd like to get some advises. Let me show you how I started to blow up a line $L\subset \mathbb A^3$. Any hint/comment/correction is highly appreciated. Suppose $L$ is given parametrically by $x=at,y=bt,z=ct$, so that $x/a=y/b=z/c$. The blow-up $\pi:\textrm{Bl}_L\mathbb A^3\to \mathbb A^3$ is the resolution of the rational map
$$
\phi:\mathbb A^3\dashrightarrow \mathbb P^1
$$
sending $P\mapsto \lambda$, where $H_\lambda\subset \mathbb A^3$ is the unique plane through $L$ and $P$. Hence $$\textrm{Bl}_L\mathbb A^3=\{(P,\lambda)\in \mathbb A^3\times\mathbb P^1\,|\,P\in H_\lambda \}\subset \mathbb A^3\times\mathbb P^1.$$
If $\lambda=(u:v)$, then $H_\lambda$ has equation $u(xb-ya)+v(yc-zb)=0$, thus
$$
\textrm{Bl}_L\mathbb A^3=\{((x,y,z);(u:v))\in \mathbb A^3\times\mathbb P^1\,|\,u(xb-ya)+v(yc-zb)=0 \}. 
$$ Question 1 . Is this correct? Question 2 . Can you please give me a hint to find the equations of the
  exceptional divisor $E=\pi^{-1}(L)$? (I am stuck on question 2, because I know I should add one more equation to $\textrm{Bl}_L\mathbb A^3$ but I cannot figure which: $L$ has two defining equations) Thanks in advance.",['algebraic-geometry']
