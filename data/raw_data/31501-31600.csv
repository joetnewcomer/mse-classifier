296213,average waiting time,"who can help me to resolution of this statistic exercise?
below the track:
Caio go in a bank,the number of customers ahead him are described by a Poisson random variable of parameter a>0.
Calculate the average waiting time knowing that:
-the waiting time is  given by the sum of service time of single person.
-the timing of customer service that precede it are modeled as random variables, independent, marginally exponential of parameter lambda >0. /////
I thought that average waiting time is given by theorem of conditional mean: E[X]=E[E[X|Y]];
then call:
Ta average waiting time -> (Ta=Summation of Ts)
,Ts time service customer
,X number of customer. E[Ta]=E[E[Ta|X]]
is right?
What will i do now?.

296217,What does projective space classify?,"Let $A$ be a ring and let $\mathbb{P}^n = \operatorname{Proj} \mathbb{Z} [x_0, \ldots, x_n]$. Question. What does $\mathbb{P}^n$ classify? In other words, is there some kind of algebraic structure (related to $A$), definable without reference to $\mathbb{P}^n$, such that there is a natural bijection between such structures and morphisms $\operatorname{Spec} A \to \mathbb{P}^n$? The geometric answer seems to be well-known: $\mathbb{P}^n$ classifies isomorphism classes of line bundles on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ equipped with $n + 1$ nowhere-vanishing global sections up to simultaneous rescaling. (I think this is in turn the same as isomorphism classes of line bundles on $\operatorname{Spec} A$ equipped with a fibrewise-linear embedding into $\mathbb{A}^{n+1} \times \operatorname{Spec} A$ that admits a fibrewise-linear retraction.)

296235,Linear system of divisors on complete variety,"I am currently reading Mumford's abelian varieties and Milne's notes on them and I have a problem understanding the proof that they are projective. Both of them use that a complete linear system of divisors on the abelian variety $V$ defines a morphism $V\rightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^n$ ($k$ can be assumed algebraically closed). The problem I have with this is that they seem to assume that the $k$-vector space
$$
L(D)\cup \{0\}=\{f\in k(V)^{\times}|~div(f)+D\geq 0\}\cup \{0\}

This is true for projective schemes $X$ by theorem 5.19 in Hartshorne that says that $\Gamma(X,F)$ is finite-dimensional for any coherent sheaf $F$ and our vector space is $\Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}(D))$. However we don't know that $V$ is projective yet. I think the crucial property of $V$ we need to use here is completeness. I'll include definition and some basic properties: An abelian variety is per definition a complete connected group variety.

296293,If $A$ is a matrix and $p$ is a polynomial such that $p(A)=0$ then must the roots of $p$ necessarily be eigenvalues of $A$?,"This is just a small query: If $A$ is an $n\times n$ square matrix and $p(t)=(t-\lambda_1)(t-\lambda_2)\cdots(t-\lambda_m)$ be a polynomial (with $\lambda_i \in \mathbb{C}$ for all $i=1, \ldots, m$) such that $p(A)=0$, then is it necessary that $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m$ will be eigenvalues of $A?$ Now I know that if $p(A)=0$ then the minimal polynomial $m_A$ divides $p$; and as $m_A$ is a non-zero polynomial there should be at least one $\lambda_i$ which will be an eigenvector of $A$. But apart from that, I have no idea what to do for this question. The following question is something that I thought I might add with the first one in order to straighten up my understandings in this area.

296302,How does the answer to Feynman's Restaurant Problem change if $M$ is not restricted to a single value?,"First, the background: Feynman's restaurant problem asks how we can maximise the total rating of the meals we eat at a restaurant with $N$ items on the menu, given that we know up-front that we are going to eat $M$ meals there . I have transcribed the problem and answer: Assume that a restaurant has $N$ dishes on its menu that are rated
  from worst to best, $1$ to $N$ (according to your personal
  preferences). You, however, don't know the ratings of the dishes, and
  when you try a new dish, all you learn is whether it is the best
  (highest rated) dish you have tried so far, or not. Each time you eat
  a meal at the restaurant you either order a new dish or you order the
  best dish you have tried so far. Your goal is to maximize the average
  total ratings of the dishes you eat in $M$ meals (where $M \leq N$). The average total ratings in a sequence of meals that includes $n$
  ""new"" dishes and $b$ ""best so far"" dishes can be no higher than the
  average total ratings in the sequence having all $n$ ""new"" dishes
  followed by all $b$ ""best so far"" dishes. Thus a successful strategy
  requires you to order some number of new dishes and thereafter only
  order the best dish so far. The problem then reduces to the following: Given $N$ (dishes on the menu) and $M\leq N$ (meals to be eaten at
  the restaurant), how many new dishes $D$ should you try before
  switching to ordering the best of them for all the remaining $(M–D)$
  meals, in order to maximize the average total ratings of the dishes
  consumed? Answer : $D = \sqrt{2(M+1)} - 1$ So if we are visiting a restaurant with $20$ dishes $7$ times, we should pick different dishes for the first $3$ trips, then have the best of those the next $4$ times. However, as far as practical application goes, this answer is the answer to a question that doesn't match reality - rarely do we know exactly how many times we're going to eat at a restaurant! Suppose instead of having $M$ equal some fixed value, we instead have $M$ distributed according to some probability distribution $P$. For example, suppose we know we are going to visit a restaurant with $20$ dishes on some number of occasions uniformly distributed over $5..10$. What now should be our value for $D$? What about if $P$ is a less simple distribution? * edit to add * Is it as simple as $\sum_m{P(m) D(m)}$ (which is I think $E(D)$?) where $D(m) = \sqrt{2(m+1)} - 1$ as above? Assuming that $P$ can't change over the course of the exercise, which as mjqxxxx points out would be quite possible in reality...",['probability']
296305,On Magnitudes of Sums of Roots of Unity and a Simple Trigonometric Inequality,"The Problem Let $r,q,m$ be positive integers such that $4 \leq r$ and $1<m,q\leq r/2$. Is it the case that $$\left |  \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \zeta^{km}\right | < \left |\sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \zeta^{k}\right |,$$ where $\zeta$ is a primitive $r^{th}$ root of unity. Continuous Variant Through use of a non-standard trigonometric identity which may be found here we can change the previous inequality to $$|\sin(mq\pi/r)\sin(\pi/r)| < |\sin(m\pi/r)\sin(q\pi/r)|.$$ Then we may substitute real variables. Let $\theta \in (0,\pi/4]$ and $a,b \in \mathbb R$ so that $0< a\theta, b \theta \leq \pi$. The we have the inequality $$| \sin(ab \theta) \sin(\theta) |< | \sin(a \theta)\sin(b \theta) |. $$ Fix $\theta$ and consider the function $$f(x,y)=\frac{\sin(xy\theta)\sin(\theta)}{\sin(x\theta)\sin(y\theta)}$$ where $(x,y) \in [1,\pi/(2\theta)]^2=X$. So if we can show that $f$ has a unique maximum on $X$ at $(1,1)$ we would also have our result. One can show with a somewhat painful computation that the critical points of $f$ are on the line $x=y$, so we can consider instead the function $$g(x)=\frac{\sin(x^2\theta)\sin(\theta)}{\sin^2(x\theta)}$$ and the corresponding inequality $$|\sin(x^2\theta)\sin(\theta)|<|\sin^2(x\theta)|.$$ I have some partial results in this case where essentially I can control the inequality depending on where $x^2\theta$ is modulo $2\pi$. Which comes down to everything except when the residue of $x^2\theta$ modulo $2\pi$ is in the interval $(2x\theta-\theta,2x\theta)$. Motivation Let the generalized binomial coefficient $C_q(n,k)$ be the coefficient of $x^k$ in the polynomial $(1+x+\cdots+x^{q-1})^k$, sometimes this appears in the literature as $\binom{n}{k}_q$. Define $$PC_q(n,r,k)=\sum_{j \in \mathbb Z} C_q(n,k+rj)$$ then the sums in the statement of the problem arise naturally as the coefficients of a discrete Fourier expansion of $PC_q$. In particular proving the desired inequality shows that $PC_q$ behaves as a sine function as $n \rightarrow \infty$. There's some more background on $C_q$ and $PC_q$ is this answer .","['inequality', 'calculus', 'combinatorics']"

296320,Other Euler characteristics?,"At the end of V.3.4 in Algebra: Chapter 0 , Aluffi describes the construction of a Grothendieck group over the category of finite dimensional $\operatorname{k}$-vector spaces, $K(\operatorname{k-vect^f})$. You first construct $F^{\operatorname{Ab}}([\operatorname{k-vect^f}])$, the free abelian group on the isomorphism classes of objects in $\operatorname{k-vect^f}$. Then you quotient out the subgroup generated by $[V]-[U]-[W]$ whenever there is an exact  \begin{equation}
0\longrightarrow U\longrightarrow V\longrightarrow W\longrightarrow 0.
\end{equation} Although the construction works in more general settings ( over exact categories ), but let's just focus on this $K(\operatorname{k-vect^f})$. In particular, this Grothendieck group gives a generalized Euler characteristic \begin{equation}
\chi_K(V_{\bullet})=\sum(-1)^j[V_j],
\end{equation} where $V_{\bullet}$ is the complex\begin{equation}
0\longrightarrow V_{N}\longrightarrow V_{N-1}\longrightarrow V_{N-2}\longrightarrow\cdots\longrightarrow V_0\longrightarrow 0.
\end{equation} Allufi says this this universal in the sense that if $\delta:\operatorname{k-vect^f}\to G$ is a function from $\operatorname{k-vect^f}$ to an abelian group satisfying two natural conditions: $\delta(V)=\delta(V')$ if $V\cong V'$, and $\delta(V/U)=\delta(V)-\delta(U)$, then there is a unique group homomorphism $\operatorname{k-vect^f}\to G$ that maps \begin{equation}
\chi_{K}(V_\bullet)\mapsto \chi_{G}(V_\bullet):=\sum(-1)^j\delta(V_j).
\end{equation} Note that the original Euler characteristic is obtained by taking $\delta(V)=\operatorname{dim}(V)$. All this seems impressive, but it would not be powerful if we did not have a supply of other $\delta$ functions other than $\operatorname{dim}$. Unfortunately I could not think of interesting examples of such functions. Can someone give some nice examples? Maybe $\operatorname{k-vect^f}$ is not so good because its Grothendieck group is too simple, so examples from other categories are also welcome.

296334,Question on an isomorphism in the proof that $k[V \times W] \cong k[V] \otimes_k k[W]$,"First I should say that I am aware of the existence of this question here and this question here. My question is a little different from these two because I am asking about a certain detail in the proof and besides $V$ and $W$ are now just algebraic sets and not affine varieties. Now $V \times W$ is naturally an algebraic set as follows. If $V$ is the zero locus of some $f_1,\ldots f_k\in k[\Bbb{A}^n]$ and $W$ of $g_1,\ldots,g_l$ in $k[\Bbb{A}^m]$ I believe that $V \times W$ is now the zero locus of $f_1,\ldots,f_k,g_1,\ldots,g_l$ now considered as polynomials in $k[\Bbb{A}^n \times \Bbb{A}^m]$. For notational purposes I will now define $$\begin{eqnarray*} R &\stackrel{\text{def}}{\equiv}& k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]\\

A natural question to ask (for me at least) is are all functions $f: D\rightarrow D$ which are contractions with respect to $\rho$ holomorphic? This cannot be true exactly as stated since, if we denote the conjugation map by $\tau: z\mapsto \bar{z}$, we have, for an arbitrary holomorphic function $f$:
\begin{align}
\rho(f\circ\tau(z_1), f\circ\tau(z_2)) & \leq \rho(\tau(z_1),\tau(z_2))\\

Since $\tau$ is an isometry for $\rho$; but $f\circ\tau$ is anti-analytic. So, my question is: Is every function which is a contraction with respect to $\rho$ either analytic or anti-analytic?

296457,Solve integral by Mellin-Barnes representation,"We start with the following integral $$I:=\int_0^\infty\mathrm{d}\alpha\,(a+\alpha)^{-\lambda}$$ which is easily evaluated to ${\frac {{a}^{-\lambda+1}}{\lambda-1}}$ by direct integration over $\alpha$ assuming that $a>0,\lambda>1$. This is not what I want to do. In my real-world case the situation is more complicated: I have multiple integrals over $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$ from $0$ to $\infty$, and the integrand is $(f(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n))^{-\lambda}$ where $f$ is a polynom of degree $n$ of $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n$. Though the problem I stumbled upon occurs in the simplified integral $I$: Given the Mellin-Barnes representation $$ \frac{1}{(a+b)^\lambda} = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\lambda)}\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} \mathrm{d}z\,\Gamma(-z)\Gamma(\lambda+z)\frac{a^z}{b^{\lambda+z}}$$ (The contour is closed such that poles of $\Gamma(-z)$ are separated from those of $\Gamma(\lambda+z)$; the residues will give a geometric series that leads to the representation.) I can apply it to the integrand of $I$: $$I=\int_0^\infty\mathrm{d}\alpha\,(a+\alpha)^{-\lambda}=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\lambda)}\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^\infty\mathrm{d}\alpha \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} \mathrm{d}z\,\Gamma(-z)\Gamma(\lambda+z)\frac{a^z}{\alpha^{\lambda+z}}$$ My plan was now to integrate over $\alpha$, since the sum in the denominator was converted to a product, and the $\alpha$-integration should be trivial. The problem here is that the integration is from $0$ to $\infty$ and the integration over $\alpha$ is not possible here. Can someone point me to the source of the problem in this situation? For those familiar with physics: $\alpha$ is a Schwinger parameter coming from parametrizing a Feynman loop integral ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_parametrization ). One usually performs Feynman-parametrization ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_parametrization ), which leads to integrals from $0$ to $1$ with integrands similar to $I$. Then one inserts the Mellin-Barnes representation and can perform the outer integrations trivially. Only the Mellin-Barnes integrals are left to perform. In my case it is a bit more complicated and I cannot use Feynman parametrization. EDIT Addition: Stumbling upon the mellin transformation representation of exp(-y) I noticed the same problem here: $$\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}y\, e^{-y} = 1 = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}y\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\mathrm{d}s\, \Gamma(s) y^{-s}$$","['physics', 'complex-analysis']"

296551,"What is a minimal polynomial of a group element, and why would we care if it was quadratic?","EDIT: the $p$ -stable definition I give below is incorrect.  I have included the correct definition as an answer to this question. I am trying to understand the definition of a p-stable group.  The first part of the definition is A faithful representation of a finite group $G$ on a vector space over a field of characteristic $p\not= 2$ is called $p$ -stable if no $p$ -element of $G$ has a quadratic minimal polynomial. What does it mean for a group element to have a minimal polynomial? Additionally, any intuition on a meaningful interpretation of this definition would be much appreciated.  What is special about elements which have quadratic minimal polynomials?  Why would we want to get rid of them?  What's wrong with $p=2$ ? After this, If $G$ has no nontrivial $p$ -subgroups, $G$ is $p$ -stable if every faithful characteristic $p$ representation is $p$ -stable. If $1<O_p(G)$ and $1=O_{p'}(G)$ then $G$ is $p$ -stable if for all normal nontrivial $p$ -subgroups $P$ , for every $p$ -element $x$ such that $[[x,P],x]=1$ , the image $\overline{x}$ in $G/C_G(P)$ is contained in a normal $p$ -subgroup. If $1<O_p(G)$ and $1<O_{p'}(G)$ , then $G$ is $p$ -stable if $G/O_{p'}(G)$ is $p$ -stable. What, mainly, is the connection between the $p$ -stable representation definition and $\#2$ ?  Are these somehow the same, but in a different light? (I see that $[[x,P],x]$ are elements of the form $p^{-1}x^{-1}pxx^{-1}x^{-1}p^{-1}xpx=(x^{-1})^p(p^{-1})^xpx$ , so if that is equal to $1$ then $px=p^xx^p$ .  So there's sort of a ""double twist"" happening, which must be important in some way; but I don't see immediately any connection to minimal polynomials.)

Let $k$ be a field and $V \subseteq \Bbb{A}^n$ and $W \subseteq \Bbb{A}^m$ be algebraic sets. Then it should be true that $I(V \times W ) = I(V) + I(W)$ where by $I(V)$ here we mean the extension of $I(V)k[x_1,\ldots,x_{m+n}]$. Now I believe I have proven this (see the proof at the bottom of my question) but when I look at Martin's answer here , it is instead claimed that we  actually have $$I(V \times W )= \sqrt{I(V) + I(W)},$$ and for $I(V) + I(W)$ to be a radical ideal we need $k$ to be algebraically closed. My question is: What's going on here? I believe my claim is true even without the assumption that $k$ is algebraically closed. Here's a proof user Sanchez told me of, which I have simplified: First it is clear that we always have $I(V) + I(W) \subseteq I(V \times W)$. For the reverse inclusion consider a polynomial $f \in I(V \times W)$. Then we can always write
$$f = \sum_{i=1}^n f_ig_i$$
where $f_i \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ and $g_i \in k[x_{n+1},\ldots,x_{m+n}]$. Now take any $b' \in W$. If for all $i$ we have $g_i(b') = 0$ then since $b'$ is arbitrary, $g_i \in I(W)$ for all $i$. Then $f \in I(W) \subseteq I(V ) + I(w)$ and we are done. Otherwise suppose there exists $b \in W$  and $i$ such that $g_i(b) \neq 0$. Then wlog we may suppose that  $g_1(b) \neq 0$. Next, $\sum f_ig_i(b) = 0 $ on all of $V$ by assumption of $f \in I(V \times W)$. So $\sum f_i g_i(b) = p$ for some $p \in I(V)$. Now write
$$f_1 = \frac{ p - g_2(b) f_2 + \ldots g_n(b)f_n}{g_1(b)}.$$ Substituting this for $f_1$ in $\sum f_ig_i$, followed by taking things mod $I(V)$ we get an  expression with only $n-1$ terms $\mod{I(V)}$. Continuing this process we will finally get an expression with $0$ terms $\mod{I(V)}$ so that $f \in I(V)$. This shows $I(V \times W) \subseteq I(V) + I(W)$ which completes the proof.",['algebraic-geometry']
