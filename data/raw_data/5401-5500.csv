40133,"Compact Hermitian Operator, closed range implies finite rank","Let $K$ be a compact Hermitian operator on a Hilbert space $H$. How to show that if $K$ has infinite rank then the range of $K$ is not closed in $H$? My thought is that suppose range $K$ is closed in $H$ and then we need to prove that $K$ has finite rank. So far I think that spectral theorem can be applied. I want to find contradiction to compactness, but I still have no idea. Thank you for your help.",['functional-analysis']
40137,How can there be multiple irreducible representations of a group each having distinct dimension?,"The matrix elements for the $(2l+1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of SO(3) are given by: $D_{m',m}^l(\phi_1,\Phi,\phi_2)=[i^{m'-m}\sqrt{(l+m')!(l-m')!(l+m)!(l-m)!}$
$\times(\frac{1+\cos\Phi}{2})^l (\frac{1-\cos\Phi}{1+\cos\Phi})^{(m'-m)/2}$
$\times\sum\limits_k \frac{(-1)^k}{(l+m-k)!(l-m'-k)!(m'-m+k)!k!}$
$\times(\frac{1-\cos\Phi}{1+\cos\Phi})^k] e^{im'\phi_2}e^{im\phi_1}$ My question is, how can there be multiple irreducible representations of SO(3) each of which has a different dimension?  I thought that by definition an irreducible representation is one which has no non-trivial invariant subspace.  I know that SO(3) can be represented by the group of 3x3 symmetric matrices of determinant = 1 (I thought this had something to do with the fact that it takes 3 parameters to describe a 3D rotation).  If I have a larger matrix (e.g. 5x5) doesn't it have to have a non-trivial invariant subspace (e.g. of dimension 2), and therefore be reducible? The application here is the expansion of functions using generalized spherical harmonics, which is accomplished (per the Peter-Weyl theorem) using an infinite linear combination of the matrix elements of the irreducible representationS (emphasis on the S) of SO(3).","['representation-theory', 'group-theory']"
40139,Fun calculus problem I can't seem to solve,"I've recently picked up a math book I haven't read since college (highly recommended reading by the way!). I was reviewing multi-dimentional derivatives and such, and I stumbled upon a problem I've been trying to solve for two days, and I can't get it out of my head, so please help me out! = ) Problem (from memory): There is a rabbit that runs in a perfect circle of radius $r$ with a constant speed $v$. A fox chases the rabbit, starting from the center of the circle and also moves with a constant speed $v$ such that it is always between the center of the circle and the rabbit. How long will it take for the fox to catch the rabbit? I tried using the fact that $|x'(t)| = |y'(t)| = v$ where $x(t)$ is fox's position and $y(t)$ is rabbit's position, and that $x'(t)x''(t) = 0$ because of constant speed restriction, but I'm still failing to find a solution. Anyone feel like attacking this one?",['calculus']
40140,When does variété mean manifold?,"Following advice from this post , I am in the process of translating Ehresmann's 1934 paper ""Sur la Topologie de Certains Espaces Homogènes"" from French to English. French-English dictionaries online and Google translate are helping me out quite a bit. However, I'm confused about the standard usage of the word variété in French mathematics writing. It can be translated as either variety or manifold. Does the phrase variété algébrique translate to algebraic variety, or algebraic manifold? The difference is subtle, and maybe not all that important for my purposes in studying the Grassmann manifolds which are simultaneously algebraic varieties and topological manifolds, whence algebraic manifolds. Of course, I could think of Grassmann manifolds all the time as algebraic manifolds, but in translating the paper I want to have the same frame of mind as Ehresmann did when he wrote it.","['terminology', 'algebraic-geometry', 'grassmannian', 'algebraic-topology']"
40149,Intuition of the meaning of homology groups,"I am studying homology groups and I am looking to try and develop, if possible, a little more intuition about what they actually mean. I've only been studying homology for a short while, so if possible I would prefer it if this could be kept relatively simple, but I imagine it is entirely possible there is no real answer to my query anyway. As I said above, I want to gain a little deeper understanding of what the n-th homology group actually means: I can happily calculate away using Mayer-Vietoris but it doesn't really give me a great deal of intuition about what the n-th homology group actually means. For example, with homotopy groups, the fundamental group is in some sense a description of how loops behave on the object in question, and it is obvious to me why that is what it is for say, the torus or the circle. However, I have no idea what, if anything, I am actually saying about a triangulable object when I talk about it having 0-th homology group this or 1st homology group that. The best I have been able to find online or in my limited book selection is the brief description ""intuitively, the zeroth homology group counts how many disjoint pieces make up the shape and gives that many copies of $\Bbb Z$, while the other homology groups count different types of holes"". What 'different types of holes' are there, roughly speaking? I appreciate that it may often be completely non-obvious what the low-order homology groups are for some complicated construction, but perhaps in simpler examples it might be more explicable. Are there (simple) cases where I could say, just from looking something like e.g. the torus, what its zero-th or first or second etc. homology group was based on the nature of the object? I guess in the zero-th case it is, as my source ( http://teamikaria.com/hddb/wiki/Homology_groups ) above says, related to the number of disjoint pieces. Can we delve deeper than this for the other homology groups? Any book/website suggestions would be welcomed (preferably websites as I am nowhere near a library!) - I have Hatcher but not a great deal else, and I haven't gleaned as much as I wish to from that alone. Of course I know that there is a great deal we don't know about homology groups even today, so I don't expect some magical all-encompassing answer, but any thoughts you could provide would be appreciated. I hope this question is appropriate for SE Mathematics, apologies if not! -M","['general-topology', 'homology-cohomology', 'algebraic-topology', 'soft-question']"

40155,How can I determine the cardinality of a set of polymorphic functions?,"It seems obvious to me that the set of functions with the signature $\forall A. A \rightarrow A$ is ""once-inhabited"", i.e. there is only one such polymorphic function which ""works"" for any set $A$, which is the identity function. (I think perhaps mathematicians would consider this to be actually a whole family of functions; I'm coming from CS where we tend to talk about single polymorphic functions, but feel free to explain how a mathematician would phrase the problem). However I don't know how to prove it except in a very hand-wavy manner. A slightly more complex example would be to show that $$\forall A B C. (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (B \rightarrow C) \rightarrow (A \rightarrow C)$$ is also once-inhabited, and that the only such function with this signature is the function composition operator.","['lambda-calculus', 'computer-science', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

40173,FFT signal post processing,"This is more a ""post a suggestion"" topic rather than a question. And thank you if you are willing to read this whole. I've been studing the code in the Nvidia Cuda SDK regarding how to operate a convolution between matrix and kernel using FFT (so basically you transform matrix and kernel and perform a multiplication in the frequency domain.. eventually you inverse-transform the result and you're done). For the ones of you interested in the code quickly these are the classes http://nopaste.info/30c13e44fe.html http://nopaste.info/78d22afac2.html Anyway I got everything that the code does... excepted one thing: the code seems to perform a pre-processing step before the multiplication. After the multiplication the code is again post-processed. So seems like a signal modulation or signal processing of some kind I can't understand.. if it was for me I'd perform the multiplication without all these complications, but I suppose the author of the code had good reasons to add these processing steps. The routines are here: inline __device__ void spPostprocessC2C(fComplex& D1, fComplex& D2, const fComplex& twiddle){
    float A1 = 0.5f * (D1.x + D2.x);
    float B1 = 0.5f * (D1.y - D2.y);
    float A2 = 0.5f * (D1.y + D2.y);
    float B2 = 0.5f * (D1.x - D2.x);

    D1.x = A1 + (A2 * twiddle.x + B2 * twiddle.y);

    float A2 = /* 0.5f * */ (D1.y + D2.y);
    float B2 = /* 0.5f * */ (D1.x - D2.x);

    D1.x = A1 - (A2 * twiddle.x - B2 * twiddle.y);
    D1.y = (B2 * twiddle.x + A2 * twiddle.y) + B1;
    D2.x = A1 + (A2 * twiddle.x - B2 * twiddle.y);

getTwiddle(twiddle, phaseBase * (float)x);
spPostprocessC2C(D1, D2, twiddle); this code gets executed. x is the row index of the padded matrix, phaseBase is defined as follows const double phaseBase = PI / (double)DX; so it's PI / image_width.

40203,covering a space with closures of disjoint sets from a basis,"We are given a compact metric topological space $X$ and a base $\beta$ of its topology. Is it always possible to find a subset of the basis, say $\beta_0 \subset \beta$, such that each point of the space is contained in a closure of a set from $\beta_0$, i.e. $\bigcup_{U \in \beta_0} \overline{U} = X$, and the sets from $\beta_0$ are pairwise disjoint, i.e. $\forall U,V \in \beta_0 : \ U = V \vee U \cap V = \emptyset$. My guess is that it is impossible in general, because of two arguments. Firstly, there exist dense open subsets of $[0,1]$ with arbitralily small measure, so we need to be careful choosing sets for $\beta_0$ (making it any maximal subset of $\beta$ with pairwise disjoint will not suffice). Secondly, it would just be too good to be true, and a proof of a certain measure-theoretical problem would become too simple.",['general-topology']

40240,Lifting local compactness in covering spaces,"Since the total space of a cover is locally homeomorphic to the base space, local topological properties (like local (path) connectedness, T 1 etc.) lift from the base space to the total space. The same holds for local compactness, if we assume the base space is Hausdorff. My question is, given a non-Hausdorff locally compact space $X$, must every cover of $X$ be locally compact. My intuition says no, because the compact neighbourhoods in $X$ might be too big to be ""seen"" by the covering structure. I can't think of any counterexamples, mainly because I don't remember any non-compact non-Hausdorff spaces right now and won't have access to Steen & Seebach for a couple of days. Although, when writing this, it strikes me that there could be conditions on $X$, which would ensure that the covering projection is a proper map, in which case we would be done. NB: By a locally compact space I mean a space in which every point has a compact neighbourhood. Edit: Thinking further, if the base space is T 3 /regular (the weaker of the two, whatever your convention might me) and locally compact every cover is locally compact, basically for the same reason as in the Hausdorff case.",['general-topology']

40251,When does pointwise convergence imply uniform convergence?,"On an exam question (Question 21H), it is claimed that if $K$ is compact and $f_n : K \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions increasing pointwise to a continuous function $f : K \to \mathbb{R}$, then $f_n$ converges to $f$ uniformly. I have tried proving this claim for the better part of an hour but I keep coming short. I suspect a hypothesis on equicontinuity has been omitted — partly because the first half of the question is about the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem — but I don't have access to the errata for the exam so I can't be sure. Here is my attempted proof: let $g_n = f - f_n$, so that $(g_n)$ is a sequence of continuous functions decreasing pointwise to $0$. Clearly, $0 \le \cdots \le \| g_n \| \le \| g_{n-1} \| \le \cdots \le \| g_1 \|$, so we must have $\| g_n \| \longrightarrow L$ for some constant $L$. $K$ is compact, so for each $g_n$, there is an $x_n \in K$ such that $g_n(x_n) = \| g_n \|$, and there is a convergent subsequence with $x_{n_k} \longrightarrow x$ for some $x \in K$. By hypothesis, $g_n(x) \longrightarrow 0$, and by construction $g_{n_k} (x_{n_k}) \longrightarrow L$. I'd like to conclude that $L = 0$, but to do this I would need to know that the two sequences have the same limit.

40285,"Finding, writing down and visualizing images of functions","I apologize in advance if this is a duplicate (I would expect to see something like this on here), but I haven't found anything that matches my question. I have this general difficulty (perhaps, to lack of practical experience) of finding and writing down images of functions given a domain. For example, I have recently seen this problem in a book: Given $f(x,y) = \left(\begin{array}{c}u(x,y)\\v(x,y)\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}x^2-y^2\\2xy\end{array}\right)$, find image of $f$ when $x>0$, $y>0$, $x^2+y^2<1$ Basically, it's asking for a set of inequalities for what $u$ and $v$ trace out in the $u$-$v$ plane. How do I go about solving such problems for a general case of $f : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$? For example, in the above problem, the domain of $f$ is a quarter of a circle of radius 1 in the first quadrant of the $x$-$y$ plane. How do I find what $f$ maps this to in the $u$-$v$ plane? Where do I start? Update :
So apparently (by empirically constructing a table of values), $f$ maps the quarter of a circle to a half-circle ($v$>0, $u^2+v^2<1$). Is there a way to see this intuitively? Most importantly, how can I get these two inequalities algebraically?","['algebra-precalculus', 'functions']"
40319,Maximum likelihood estimate of hypergeometric distribution parameter,"Using the notation in the Wikipedia article on the hypergeometric distribution , I'm curious how one would obtain the maximum likelihood estimate for parameter $m$ , the number of white marbles, given $T$ trials from the same urn. For convenience, I'll copy/paste the notation from the article: Suppose you are to draw $n$ marbles without replacement from an urn containing $N$ marbles in total, $m$ of which are white. The hypergeometric distribution describes the distribution of the number of white marbles drawn from the urn, $k$ . Again, assuming I conduct $T$ trials, at each trial, I take $n$ balls from the urn, and $k_i$ is the number of white balls at trial $i$ . Define $K = (k_1,\ldots,k_T)$ . Then the likelihood function $L$ : $$L(m; K, N, n) = \prod_i^T \frac{\binom{m}{k_i}\binom{N-m}{n-k_i}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$ Taking a hint from this post , I first tried to solve the inequality: $$L(m;K,N,n) \geq L(m-1;K,N,n)$$ when $T=1$ . From this I obtained $$m \leq \frac{Nk+k}{n}$$ so the MLE should be $$m = \left\lfloor \frac{Nk+k}{n} \right\rfloor$$ Now, I'm stuck when I try to generalize to $T \geq 2$ .

Then I tried to take the log of the likelihood and differentiate as if $m$ were defined over positive reals and I ended up with an equally unwieldy equation to solve: $$\sum_i^T \left(\Psi(m+1) - \Psi(m-k_i+1) - \Psi(N-m+1) + \Psi(N-m-n+k_i+1)\right) = 0$$ where $\Psi$ is the digamma function (i.e. the derivative of the log-gamma function).

I don't have any idea how that proposition might help. If $E$ is countable, then a subset of $E$ is equipotent to $E$ iff it is infinite.

The (short) given justification is that the centre $Z(D_{2n}) \cong C_2$, whenever $n$ is even, and is trivial provided that $n$ is odd. However, here is a result that a friend of mine found in the litterature which contradicts the previous one. Suppose that 4 divides $n$. Then $D_{2n}$ is not isomorphic to $C_2 \times D_n$. Proof: Suppose otherwise. We know that $Z(D_{2n}) \cong C_2$. By assumption, $D_{2n} \cong C_2 \times D_n$, therefore $Z(D_{2n}) \cong Z(C_2 \times D_{n})$. Since in a direct product $A \times B$, the groups $A$ and $B$ commute, we obtain that $Z(C_2 \times D_{n}) = Z(C_2) \times Z(D_n) \cong C_2 \times C_2$, a contradiction. QED. Now comes my first question : Is the above proof correct? Second question : Given a finite group $G$ whose centre is not trivial, does it always exist a group $H$ such that $G \cong Z(G) \times H$? If so, then given $n$ a multiple of 4, the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ could be written as a direct product $C_2 \times H$.

I precomputed a lot of values that took days to compute (with the load spread on several computers).

Basically, I've got a problem like this: I precomputed C(38,6) values ( i.e . 2 760 681 values)  that are now store in a big lookup table.  Memory ain't an issue.  Precomputing ain't an issue.  The ""order"" ain't an issue and I can re-order in any way I like. Also, C(38,6) is just an example, I could be needing C(42,7) as well, etc. When I did the precomputing, I basically looped like this (the actual code is more complicated for the load needed to be spread across several machines and for the actual computation aren't here but here's the meat of it): for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {

What I've got now is a binary search: my i shall always be lower than j , j lower than k etc.  I then created an arbitrary index doing: (i + 1) * (n exp 5) + (j + 1) * (n exp 4) + (k + 1) * (n exp 3) + (l + 1) * (n exp 2) + (m + 1) * n + o This is probably overkill but guarantees no collisions. I then do a binary search on that index and find where the precomputed value is stored. This is kinda fast but I was wondering if there was a faster way to ""reach"" my precomputed index? Basically because I don't know enumerative combinatorics well enough I'm precomputing my own index and using that index to do a binary search.  This is fast but I'm looking for something faster, like a closed formula (I doubt anything doing ""enumerations"" and i++ or things like that would be faster than those few multiplication to compute that index + the binary search).

40592,Half-life versus relaxation time,"Question: What is the exact relationship between half-life and relaxation time? I just wanted to nail down the difference/similarity between these two concepts. I did a web search, and even found a direct reference, but it was an exercise in an on-line textbook asking exactly what I am asking, and I copied and pasted that exercise question as my question above. Now, we all know that half-life is the time it takes for the substance to decay to half its size, and relaxation time is the time it takes for the substance to decay to 1/e of its size, so why have both concepts? My guess is that it is similar to the difference between degree measure and radian measure: Half-life is useful when dealing with specific practicalities, whereas relaxation time is more convenient when discussing theory.

degree, fixed point, $\pi_{1}(\mathbb{S}^{1})$ and has useful applications.

f(z,w) which will have a singular point at (0,0).

f(r)=f(1_R)f(r)=f(r)f(1_R)\implies f(r)-f(1_R)f(r)=0_S.

This shows that $f(1_R)$ is the identity of $f(R)$, but I'm not sure if that's much use. However, if $1_S$ exists, then from $f(r)-f(1_R)f(r)=1_Sf(r)-f(1_R)f(r)=0_S$ and the distributive law, I would have

I think BCDEA should get a fair amount of partial credit, since the relative ordering of 4 out of 5 items is correct, despite having no letters in the correct position. I'm aware of a several reasonable-sounding methods to assign partial credit.  Each method measures how ""far away"" the submitted answer is to the correct answer, and then uses some function to turn that distance into a score in a negative manner (the more the distance the less the score.) Possibilities for measuring distance: $\bullet$ Count the minimal number of adjacent transpositions that turn the submitted answer into the correct answer. $\bullet$ Create an $N$-vector measuring the distance from each letter's submitted position to its correct position, and put a notion of size on that vector.  For example DCABE would have vector $(3,1,2,2,0)$.  Size could be the standard Euclidean distance, the square of Euclidean distance, the taxicab metric... $\bullet$ Other ideas? Then there are lots of reasonable functions that turn distance into a score. $\bullet$ $\mbox{score(distance)}=100\%\cdot r^{\mbox{distance}}$, for some $r<1$. $\bullet$ $\mbox{score(distance)}=100\%-k\%\cdot\mbox{distance}$, where $k\%\cdot\mbox{(maximal distance)}=100\%$. $\bullet$ $\mbox{score(distance)}=\displaystyle\frac{100\%}{1+\mbox{distance}}$ $\bullet$ Other ideas? What I am looking for is more than just new and different proposals for scoring (although I'd love to hear more of those too).  I am more interested in reading a convincing argument for preferring a particular method of scoring.","['permutations', 'combinatorics']"
40789,An elementary integral inequality,"I was playing around with some integrals and decided that
$$
a\int_a^b t^{n−2}\alpha(t) dt 
\le
\int_a^b t^{n−1}\alpha(t) dt

for $a,b>0$, $\alpha \ge 0$, $\alpha$ nice enough so that the above expression is defined, should be true. The idea is that the little $a$ on the left hand side compensates when $t<1$ (i.e. $a<1$).  One can produce a cases `brute force' style proof from this observation. But, I wanted to ask the following: is the above inequality sharp?  Can the power of $t$ on the LHS be played with?  Can the constant $a$ be improved (perhaps depending on additional properties of $\alpha$)? And most importantly: does this little guy have a name?","['measure-theory', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

40799,Compact group actions and automatic properness,"I am currently re-reading a course on basic algebraic topology, and I am focussing
on the parts that I feel I had very little understanding of. There is one exercise
in the chapter devoted to groups acting on topological spaces (preceding the chapter
on covering spaces) that I have spent several frustrating hours on, but I just can't
crack. I will state the question below, but PLEASE, DO NOT POST A SOLUTION OR A HINT. I am
only interested in knowing wether the statement in question is true. I have looked
on the internet for a reference about this fact, but didn't get anywhere. If you
know a book that gives proves it, or a document online where this is discussed, I
would like to get the reference, in case I continue to fail at giving a proof of
this the next week. I recall some terminology first: let $X,Y$ be two topological spaces, and
$f:X\rightarrow Y$ a map that isn't supposed to be continuous. The author defines
such a map to be $\mathrm{PROPER}$ whenever the following two properties are
satisfied : $f$ is a closed map, and $\forall y\in Y, ~f^{-1}(\lbrace y\rbrace)$ is
a compact subspace of $X$. It then follows that for all compact subsets $K$ of
$Y,~f^{-1}(K)$ is a compact subset of $X$. Also, if $X$ is Hausdorff, and $Y$ is a
locally compact Hausdorff, then properness is equivalent to this property. Let $X$ be a topological space, and $G$ a topological group. Suppose there is a
continuous left group action $\rho: G\times X\rightarrow X,~(g,x)\mapsto g\cdot x$.
Let $\theta:G\times X\rightarrow X\times X, ~(g,x)\mapsto (x,g\cdot x)$. The author
defines the group action to be $\mathrm{proper}$ if $\theta$ is a proper map. Here is the question: ""Show the action of a compact Hausdorff group $G$ on a
Hausdorff space $X$ is always proper"". As I said, I have struggled with this for days (since friday). IS THAT STATEMENT
TRUE? There are no further hypothesis, $X$ is not supposed to be locally compact,
and the action is completely arbitrary (continuous of course, but not supposed free,
or other things). Thank you for your time!","['general-topology', 'topological-groups', 'group-theory', 'locally-compact-groups']"
40810,How to integrate by parts in spherical coordinates,"I'm running into some troubles with the integration of a spherically symmetric 3D function. 
I'm having the following expression to evaluate :
$$
I=\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta d\theta\int_0^\infty \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} r^2 dr
$$ where the generic function $f$ only depends on the radius $r$. If I where in Cartesian coordinates, there wouldn't be any $r^2$ term and the integral would be 0 provided that $f$ vanishes at infinity (which is ok). Now, in spherical coordinates, this does not seem to be true. If I integrate first over the angles, I get a factor $4\pi$ in front of the radial integral. I can then integrate by parts to remove the partial derivative and I obtain :
$$
I=-8\pi\int_0^\infty f(r)r dr
$$
as the boundary terms vanish if $f(r) \rightarrow 0$. At first sight, this seems to be correct. However, when looking at the definition of integration by parts in $R^n$: $$
\int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} v \,d\Omega = \int_{\Gamma} u v \, \nu_i \,d\Gamma - \int_{\Omega} u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x_i} \, d\Omega
$$ Where $\nu_i$ is a unit vector on $\Gamma$ the boundary of $\Omega$.
My previous computation does not seem to be right. The $r^2$ term is part of the integration measure $d\Omega$ and should thus not be taken into account for the ""derivative-swap"". This would mean that my first integral is $0$ for all functions $f$ that behave nicely and vanish sufficiently fast as $\rightarrow\infty$.
$$
I= \left| f(r) r^2 \right|_{r=0}^{r=\infty} = 0
$$ Which (if any) of the two version is correct ? Do you know any good reference on integration by parts in non-cartesian coordinates.","['calculus', 'integration', 'spherical-coordinates']"

40830,How to define a partial derivative invariantly?,"Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and $f$, $g$  be smooth functions in some neibourhood of a point $x_0\in M$, $\nabla g\ne0$. 1) How to define $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ invariantly? If $M$ is a domaqin in $\mathbb R^n$ then the derivative in the direction of $\nabla g$ seems to give an answer: $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|^2}$. But to calculate $\nabla g$ and $|\nabla g|$ on a manifold one needs a metric. From the other hand, if we consider smooth  coordinates $(g_1=g, g_2,\ldots,g_n)$ in some neibourhood of $x_0$, then partial derivatives $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ seem to be defined in the standard way. But the question arises, would the value $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$ be independent from the choice of $ g_2,\ldots,g_n$? If no, what are the correct way do do it? Is there some reference? 2) Let $f_1, f_2,\ldots,f_n$ be a smooth coordinates in some neibourhood of $x_0$. What is the object $(\displaystyle \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial g},\ldots,\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial g})$? Would it be by some chance a section of some good fiber bundle? Is there some reference where such objects are considered? Thanks in advance! Addition of may 27 Suppose that now there is a riemannian metric on $M$. Then what would be most natural definition of partial derivative  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}$? For expample, to take $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=df(\nabla g)=(df,*dg)$ seems not right since that would mean  $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial g}=\displaystyle \frac{\partial g}{\partial f}$. If we take $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|}$ it would be sort of directional derivative. So the right question seems to me here is what value of $a$ it is best to take for $\displaystyle \frac{(\nabla f,\nabla g)}{|\nabla g|^a}$ to be a partial derivative? Or is there no the ""best"" choice?  I tried to apply to dimensional analysis and it seems $a=1$ is the choice to have the result be like $\nabla f$ but I'm not sure because may be one have to assign some dimension to metric.",['differential-geometry']

40867,Questions regarding Riemann's rearrangement theorem,"I have recently learned about Riemann's rearrangement theorem, and I have some questions regarding the theorem. Let $$\sum a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + \cdots$$ be conditionally convergent. If we switch two of the terms, for example $a_2$ and $a_3$, we get the new series $$a_1+a_3+a_2+a_4+\cdots.$$ Both the new and the old series have the same sum, and this will be the case no matter which two terms we switch. Then my (obviously wrong) claim is this: A rearrangment is just repeated switching of terms. Why is my claim wrong? I can imagine that it has something to do with the fact that for many rearrangements one has to switch two terms infinitely many times. If that is the case, I guess that one can do any finite amount of switching without altering the sum. Is this correct? I know that it was Riemann who first proved this theorem, but I can't find out when and where. Did he write a paper on it, and if he did, where can I find a copy of it? I am also grateful for any related information that could be of interest. Riemann's rearrangement theorem :

40881,Isomorphic quotients by isomorphic normal subgroups,"In this recent question , Iota asked if, given a finite group $G$ and two isomorphic normal subgroups $H$ and $K$, it would follow that $G/H$ and $G/K$ are isomorphic. This is not true (a simple example given by $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$, with $H=\langle (1,0)\rangle$ and $K=\langle (0,2)\rangle$). A sufficient condition to guarantee isomorphic quotients is the existence of an automorphism $\varphi\in\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $\varphi(H)=K$. One can also have $G/H\cong G/K$, but $H$ and $K$ not isomorphic. For example, take again $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$, and take $H=\mathbb{Z}_2\oplus\langle (0,2)\rangle$, isomorphic to the Klein $4$-group, and $K=\{0\}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_4$. Then $G/H\cong G/K\cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. And of course, it is trivial to have $H\cong K$ and $G/H\cong G/K$. Now, here's the question: Question. Can we have a finite group $G$, normal subgroups $H$ and $K$ that are isomorphic as groups, $G/H$ isomorphic to $G/K$, but no $\varphi\in\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $\varphi(H) = K$? It is not hard to come up with examples with infinite $G$. For example, take 
$$G= \mathbb{Z}_2\oplus \left(\bigoplus_{i=1}^{\infty}\;\mathbb{Z}_4\right),$$
let $H=2G$, and let $K$ be the subgroup generated by $H$ and the generator of the cyclic factor $\mathbb{Z}_2$. Then both $H$ and $K$ are isomorphic to a direct sum of countably many copies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, as are the quotients $G/H$ and $G/K$. But $H$ is a verbal subgroup, hence fully invariant, so any automorphism of $G$ maps $H$ to $H$, so there does not exist any $\varphi\in\mathrm{Aut}(G)$ such that $\varphi(H)=K$. Does someone have an example with finite $G$?
