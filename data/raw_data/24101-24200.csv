211562,What is the link of the origin of a polyhedral fan?,"I am trying to understand the article http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3651 by David Helm and Eric Katz. There the link of the origin of a polyhedral fan is mentioned. I googled and only found definitions that seemed to suggest that the link of a polyhedral fan at the origin is the fan itself. This doesn't seem right, why bother to call it the link of the origin if it were the same as the original fan. Please, does anyone know the correct definition? Thank you,

211582,Is there a proper subfield $K\subset \mathbb R$ such that $[\mathbb R:K]$ is finite?,"Is there a proper subfield $K\subset \mathbb R$ such that $[\mathbb R:K]$ is finite? Here $[\mathbb R:K]$ means the dimension of $\mathbb R$ as a $K$-vector space. What I have tried: If we can find a finite subgroup $G\subset Gal (\mathbb C/\mathbb Q)$ such
that $G$ contains the complex conjugation, it will be done by letting $K$ be the fixed field of $G$. But I don't know whether such a group exists. Maybe we can start with finding a suitable subgroup of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)$ and then lift it to $Gal(\mathbb C/\mathbb Q)$, where $\bar{\mathbb Q}$ denotes the algebraic closure of $\mathbb Q$. By isomorphism extension theorem, we can find many automorphisms of $\mathbb C$, none of them carries $\mathbb R$ to itself except for the identity. This is because $Gal(\mathbb R/\mathbb Q)$ is the trivial group. For example, now suppose $\{x_\alpha\}\subset \mathbb R$ is a transcendence basis over $\mathbb Q$. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $\{x_\alpha\}$, then by the isomorphism extension theorem, $\sigma$ extends to an automorphism of $\mathbb C$, which we still denote by $\sigma$. Then $L=\sigma(\mathbb R)$ is a copy of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb R$ is algebraic over $K=\mathbb R\cap L$. How large can $K$ be? Is it possible that $[\mathbb R:K]$ is finite? Does anyone has some ideas? Thanks!","['galois-theory', 'extension-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"
211583,set of all trace $1$ matrices are connected?,"The heading is the question and here are my two approach, I want to know are they correct or not, if not I need to know the answer: 1) They are path connected as $\gamma(t)=At+(1-t)B, t\in [0,1]$  where $A$ and $B$ are trace one matrices. But I am not sure all matrices in this path are trace $1$? 2) as trace equals $1$, so considering diagonal entries I get a hyperplane $H$ with $x_{11}+\dots+x_{nn}=1$ and remaining other $n^2-n$ entries I can send to $\mathbb{R}^{n^2-n}$ and thus they are homeomorphic to $H\times \mathbb{R}^{n^2-n}$ as this is a product of two connected topological spaces, it is connected. So trace 1 matrices are connected. Well, here I have considered a matrix is just a point in $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ Thank you.","['general-topology', 'linear-algebra']"

211633,Hölder inequality from Jensen inequality,"I'm taking a course in Analysis in which the following exercise was given. Exercise Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a probability space. Let $f\ge 0$ be a measurable function. Using Jensen's inequality, prove that for $1\le p < q$, $$\left(\int f^p\, d\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\le \left(\int f^q\, d\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{q}}.$$ Deduce Hölder's inequality from Jensen's inequality and discuss the cases of equality. The first part is standard and I had no problems with it. On the contrary, the second part is somewhat unclear. The standard proof of Hölder's inequality uses Young's inequality which may be proved by means of the convexity of the exponential function. So, strictly speaking, this is a way of ""deducing Hölder's inequality from Jensen's"", but I don't think this is what the examiner had in mind. More likely, one is supposed to look for a proof employing Jensen's inequality in $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$, or perhaps applying directly the first point. But I have no idea on how to do this.

211663,Understanding dependency graph for a set of events,"Deﬁnition 4. Let $\mathcal{E}_1 , \mathcal{E}_2 , \dots, \mathcal{E}_n$ be n events on a probability
  space $Ω$. The dependency graph is a directed graph $D = (V, E)$ on
  the set of vertices $V = {1, \dots , n} $ (corresponding to $\mathcal{E}_1 , \mathcal{E}_2
 , \dots, \mathcal{E}_n$ ) if for each $1 ≤ i ≤ n, \mathcal{E}_i$ is mutually independent
  of all the events $\{\mathcal{E}_j : (i, j) \notin E\}$. Note that the dependency graph is not unique. 
  For instance, consider two independent coin ﬂips with outcome H or T.
  Consider the events $$\mathcal{E}_1 := \{(H, H), (H, T )\} \text{ (ﬁrst coin ﬂip is H)},$$ $$\mathcal{E}_2 := \{(H, H), (T, H)\} \text{  (second coin ﬂip is H)},$$ $$\mathcal{E}_3 := \{(H, H), (T, T )\} \text{ (both coin ﬂips are the same)}.$$ Then, two possible dependency graphs are as follows(for the left graph, the low-right vertex should be $\mathcal E_3$.): In the example, if I am correct, the three events $\mathcal{E}_1, \mathcal{E}_2, \mathcal{E}_3$
are pairwise independent but not mutually independent. But the first
dependency graph shows that $\mathcal{E}_1$ is mutually independent of $\mathcal{E}_3$,
$\mathcal{E}_2$ is mutually independent of $\mathcal{E}_1$, and $\mathcal{E}_3$ is mutually
independent of $\mathcal{E}_2$. The second dependency graph shows that $\mathcal{E}_1$
is mutually independent of $\mathcal{E}_3$, $\mathcal{E}_3$ is mutually independent of
$\mathcal{E}_1$, and $\mathcal{E}_2$ is mutually independent of $\mathcal{E}_1$. So it seems like a dependency graph of a set of events doesn't
necessarily need to capture all the dependence or independence relation
between events? In a dependency graph of a set of events, does existence of an edge from $A_i$ to $A_j$ imply that $A_i$ is not mutually independent of $A_j$? I think no, because in the example, the three events are pairwise independent,  but there are edges between some two of them. Is the concept an event being mutually independent of another event
not a symmetric relation between events? Our usual definition for mutual independence between two events are $P(\mathcal{E}_1 \cap \mathcal{E}_2) = P(\mathcal{E}_1) P(\mathcal{E}_2)$, which seems to be a symmetric relation between events. More generally, any directed graph with minimum out degree 1 is a
  dependency graph. If all events $\mathcal{E}_1 , \mathcal{E}_2 , \dots, \mathcal{E}_n$  are mutually independent, then
  the empty graph is a dependency graph. Why is a directed graph with ""minimum out degree 1"" singled out in
particular? Thanks and regards!","['graph-theory', 'probability']"

211787,Uniform distribution on the unit circle (in the complex plane),"I was trying to prove that for a standard complex Gaussian variable $Z$ it holds that $|Z|^2$ is exponentially distributed with parameter 1, $\frac{Z}{|Z|}$ is uniformly distributed on the unit circle $S^1:=\{z\in\mathbb{C} | |z|=1\}$ and that the two are independent. At some point I began asking myself: How does one describe the uniform distribution on the unit circle $S^1$? I resolved to say that it is the complex r.v. $e^{i\theta}$ where $\theta$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,2\pi]$. This seemed to work out fine (c.f. Byron's answer to this question ). However, if this is correct then this small argument will go through: Let $f:S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be bounded. Then
$$E[f(Z)]=\int_{0}^{2\pi}{f(e^{i\theta})\frac{1}{2\pi}}d\theta=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{S^1}{\frac{f(z)}{z}}dz,$$ where for the last equation $z=e^{i\theta}$ and thus $\frac{dz}{d\theta}=ie^{i\theta}$ i.e. $\frac{dz}{iz}=\frac{dz}{ie^{i\theta}}={d\theta}$. 
So: Is $\frac{1}{2\pi i z}$ some kind of density for a uniformly distributed random variable on $S^1$? (I write ""some kind"" as it cannot be one because the unit circle has Lebesgue-measure 0 and hence the induced probability measure cannot be absolutely continuous to it.)

However the reflexion principle tells us that $S_t-B_t$ has the same law as $S_t$, so we can also write that
$P(T<t)=P(\hat{S}_{1-t}<S_t)$. To this point, we can calculate $P(T<t)$ because we know the joint density of $(\hat{S}_{1-t},S_t)$, but this calculation leads to a complicated form of integral and I can not get the density $g$ at the end. Do you know how to get the arcsinus law? Thank you.","['probability', 'brownian-motion']"
212079,Uniform convergence of the Bergman kernel's orthonormal basis representation on compact subsets,"Consider the Bergman kernel $K_\Omega$ associated to a domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb C^n$. By the reproducing property, it is easy to show that
$$K_\Omega(z,\zeta) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \varphi_k(z) \overline{\varphi_k(\zeta)},\qquad(z,\zeta\in\Omega)$$
where $\{\varphi_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ is any orthonormal basis of the Bergman space $A^2(\Omega)$ of Lebesgue square-integrable holomorphic functions on $\Omega$. This series representation converges at least pointwise, since the Bergman kernel's Fourier series, $K_\Omega(\cdot,\zeta) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle K_\Omega(\cdot,\zeta), \varphi_k \rangle \varphi_k$ with $\langle K_\Omega(\cdot,\zeta), \varphi_k \rangle = \overline{\varphi_k(\zeta)}$ converges in norm which implies uniform convergence in the first argument for fixed $\zeta \in \Omega$. Now in Books such as Function Theory of Several Complex Variables by S. Krantz, it is shown that the series is uniformly bounded on compact sets, namely
$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \big| \varphi_k(z) \overline{\varphi_k(\zeta)} \big| \leq \bigg(\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\varphi_k(z)|^2 \bigg)^{1/2} \bigg(\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\varphi_k(\zeta)|^2 \bigg)^{1/2} \leq C(K)^2,\qquad(z,\zeta \in K)$$
where $C(K)$ is a constant depending only on the compact set $K\subseteq \Omega$. My question is this: Why does this imply uniform convergence on compact sets in $\Omega \times \Omega$? This is claimed in several sources, but just stated and not proven. Am I missing something obvious here? One book which is a bit more specific is Holomorphic Functions and Integral Representations in Several Complex Variables by M. Range. There it is written that uniform convergence on compact subsets of $\Omega \times \Omega$ follows from the uniform bound and a ""normality argument"", which I take as referring to Montel's theorem. Does anyone know the details on how this argument works? Any help is appreciated.","['bergman-spaces', 'several-complex-variables', 'complex-analysis', 'analysis']"

I don't mean trivial calculation of advance widths or similar, I mean analyzing the shape of glyphs to estimate the visually optimal distance between characters.

It should be shifted a certain amount towards T so that it seems to be in the middle of T and g .

The integral of a bounded function $f:I\to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as follows: If $\mathcal{P}=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n :c_{i-1,j}\le x_j\le c_{i,j}\ , j=1,...,n, i=1,...,k \right\}$ 
is a partition of $I$ with subpartitions $\mathcal{P}_i=\left\{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n :c_{i-1,j}\le x_j\le c_{i,j}\ , j=1,...,n \right\}$ we define the upper and lower Riemann sums of $f$ as

\begin{gather}\mathcal{P}_1=\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}:c_{i-1,j}\le x_j\le c_{i,j}\ , j=1,...,n, i=1,...,k \right\}\text{ and }\notag\\

Obviously $\mathcal{P}_{1i}\times\mathcal{P}_{2i}= \mathcal{P}_i$ and $\mathcal{P}_{1}\times\mathcal{P}_{2}= \mathcal{P}$. 
Then, for $i=1,...,k$
\begin{equation}\inf_{(x,y)\in \mathcal{P}_i}f(x,y)=\inf_{x\in \mathcal{P}_{1i}}\left(\inf_{y\in \mathcal{P}_{2i}}f(x,y)\right)\end{equation}
Indeed, for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$,
\begin{gather}\exists x\in \mathcal{P}_{1i}:\inf_{x\in \mathcal{P}_{1i}}\left(\inf_{y\in \mathcal{P}_{2i}}f(x,y)\right)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}>\inf_{y\in \mathcal{P}_{2i}}f(x,y)\text{ and } 
\exists y\in \mathcal{P}_{2i}:\inf_{y\in \mathcal{P}_{2i}}f(x,y)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}>f(x,y)\Rightarrow \notag\\

		h_3 &= 1, \ 4, \ 10 \\

Suppose that $h_3 = 4$. If this is the case, then there exists a homomorphism of $G$ into $S_4$. Since $|S_4| = 24$ and $|G| = 60$, the kernel of this homomorphism is non-trivial, meaning that there exists a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$. This contradicts $G$ being simple, and it follows that $h_3 = 10$. Lastly, we look at $h_2$. An identical argument to the one given for $h_3$ removes 3 as a possibility for $h_2$. This leaves us with either 5 or 15 as the only reasonable values for $h_2$. Currently, we know that there are $6\cdot 4 + 10\cdot 2 = 44$ elements in our group. At this point, I want to show that assuming $h_2 =15$ leads to a contradiction (namely, that the group has more than 60 elements), but I'm not sure how to proceed. Because the Sylow $2$-subgroups have order 4, they may have non-trivial intersections. I want to show that it's somehow impossible for each 2-subgroup to contribute only one unique element of order 2. If I can do that, $h_2=5$ and the result will follow.

We know that within the unit circle $|f(z)|\leq 1+2|z|^{10/3} < 1+2|z|^3$ which gives us an upper bound, while outside of the unit circle we know that $-|f(z)|\geq -1-2|z|^{10/3} \implies |f(x)| \geq |-1-2|z|^{10/3}| = |2|z|^{10/3}--1|$ (by triangle inequality) $\geq 2|z|^{10/3}-1 > 2|z|^3-1$, which provides an lower bound of three, which by the corollary of Liouville's theorem implies that f(z) must be cubic.

213527,"Closure, Interior, and Boundary of Jordan Measurable Sets.","This question has a number of parts.  Let $E\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be a bounded subset. (1) Show that $m^{\star,(J)}(E)=m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})$ (closure) (2) Show that $m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})$ (interior) (3) Show that $E$ is Jordan measurable if and only if $m^{\star}(\partial E)=0$. I originally had different proofs for parts (1) and (2), but I revised them because I wanted a more rigorous $\epsilon$-estimate type proof (I'm trying to practice getting better at this).  But, looking at them again, I think there is a flaw.  In particular, where I make the justification that we can ""fatten up"" or ""shrink down"" the covers in each part (see the proofs).  Basically, the reason why I think it is now flawed is because if one replaces $\frac{\epsilon}{N}$ by $\frac{\epsilon}{2^{n}}$, the proof for the outer Jordan measure (part (1)) seems to carry over word-for-word in the case of Lebesgue outer measure, and that's clearly false since $\mu^{\star}([0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q})=0$, yet $\mu^{\star}(\overline{[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}})=1$. Anyway, I would appreciate anyone's assistance in helping me correct these proofs.  Also, for part (3), I'm stuck on proving the implication $m^{\star,(J)}(\partial E)=0\rightarrow E\in\mathscr{J}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. SOLUTION (1) By definition of $m^{\star,(J)}$, there exists a collection of boxes $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that both
\begin{align*}
E\subset\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E)+\epsilon
\end{align*}
hold for every $\epsilon>0$.  Because $E\Delta\bar{E}\subset E'$ (the set of limit points of $E$), by enlarging each box $B_{j}$ (as necessary), we can find a new collection of boxes $\{B'_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that each of the conditions
\begin{align*}
|B_{j}|\leq|B'_{j}|\leq|B_{j}|+\frac{\epsilon}{N},
&&\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B'_{j}\supset\bar{E}\supset E,
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B'_{j}|\leq m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})+\epsilon
\end{align*}
also holds for the same $\epsilon$.  Montonicity and the fact that $E\subset\bar{E}$ then gives
\begin{align*}
m^{\star,(J)}(E)
&\leq m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})\\
&\leq\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B'_{j}|\\
&\leq\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}\left(|B_{j}|+\frac{\epsilon}{N}\right)\\
&\leq m^{\star, (J)}(E)+2\epsilon.
\end{align*}
In particular, we obtain the estimate
$$\Bigg|m^{\star,(J)}(E)-m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})\Bigg|\leq2\epsilon,$$
and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we conclude $m^{\star,(J)}(E)=m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})$ as required. SOLUTION (2) By definition of $m_{\star, (J)}$ there exists boxes $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that both
\begin{align*}
\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}\subset E
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E)-\epsilon
\end{align*}
hold for every $\epsilon>0$.  Because $E\Delta E^{\circ}\subset\partial E\subset E'\cup\{x\in E:N_{\delta}(x)\cap E=\{x\}\forall\delta>0\}$, and isolated points have inner (and outer) measure $0$, by shrinking each box $B_{j}$ (as necessary), we can find a new collection of boxes $\{B'_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such each of the conditions
\begin{align*}
|B_{j}|\geq|B'_{j}|\geq|B_{j}|-\frac{\epsilon}{N},
&&\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{N}B'_{j}\subset E^{\circ}\subset E
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B'_{j}|\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})-\epsilon

also holds for the same $\epsilon$.  Montonicity and the fact that $E^{\circ}\subset E$ then gives
\begin{align*}
m_{\star,(J)}
&\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})\\
&\geq\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B'_{j}|\\
&\geq\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}\left(|B_{j}|-\frac{\epsilon}{N}\right)\\
&\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E)-2\epsilon.
\end{align*}
In particular, we obtain the estimate
$$\Bigg|m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})-m_{\star,(J)}(E)\Bigg|\leq2\epsilon,$$
and since $\epsilon>0$ was arbitrary, we conclude $m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})$ as required. SOLUTION (3) We have the inequality
$$m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})\leq m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})=m^{\star,(J)}(E).$$
In the case that $E$ is Jordan measurable, this immediately becomes an equality
$$m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})=m(E)=m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})=m^{\star,(J)}(E),$$
and monotonicity then implies that $m^{\star,(J)}(E\Delta\bar{E})=m^{\star,(J)}(E\Delta E^{\circ})=0$, which means that both $\bar{E}$ and $E^{\circ}$ are Jordan measurable with measure $m(E)$.  Boolean closure then implies $\partial E$ is Jordan measurable since $\partial E=\bar{E}-E^{\circ}$, and from additivity we have $$m(\partial E)=m(\bar{E})-m(E^{\circ})=0.$$
Now suppose $\partial E=0$. Then sub-additivity of $m^{\star,(J)}$ and $m_{\star,(J)}$ implies
$$0=m^{\star,(J)}_{\star,(J)}(\partial E)\geq m^{\star,(J)}_{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})-m^{\star,(J)}_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})\geq0,$$
so that the original inequality is extended to
$$m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})=m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})=m^{\star,(J)}(E)=m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E}).$$ COMMENTS (Update 1) I want to look a little closer at my argument in (1).  I can't see why it's incorrect, but perhaps a modification will make it more rigorous. For convenience, let's used cubes $Q_{j}$ instead of boxes $B_{j}$ (that the former can be used in the definition of Jordan content is an easy consequence of the fact that any box $B_{j}$ can be arbitrarily approximated by a finite number of cubes by an obvious dissection process). Then I have a collection of cubes $\{Q_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that $\bigcup_{j=1}^{N} Q_{j}\supset E$ and $\sum_{j=1}^{N}|Q_{j}|\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E)+\epsilon$. Suppose each cube has some index length $\ell_{j}$, and consider the cubes $\{Q_{j}'\}_{j=1}^{N}$ obtained by enlarging each $\ell_{j}\mapsto\ell_{j}+\frac{epsilon}{N}$. Then this collection covers $\bar{E}$ for the following reasons.  If $E$ has any isolated points, then the $Q_{j}$ already covered them, so the $Q'_{j}$ certainly cover them as well.  Therefore, the only other points in $\bar{E}\backslash E$ are limit points of the set $E$.  But limit points are arbitrarily close to $E$, the set covered by the $Q_{j}$ (they have distance $0$ from the cover), and since by the explicit construction $dist(Q_{j},Q'_{j})=\frac{\epsilon}{N}>0$ and $Q'_{j}$ also cover $E$, we conclude the $Q'_{j}$ also cover $\bar{E}$.  (If this is wrong, pleeaaassseee explain to me the logical fault). Then we have
\begin{align*}
m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})
&\leq\sum_{j=1}^{N}|Q'_{j}|\\
&=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(\ell_{j}+\frac{\epsilon}{N}\right)^{d}\\
&=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=0}^{d}\binom{d}{k}\left(\ell_{j}^{k}\left(\frac{\epsilon}{N}\right)^{d-k}\right)\\
&=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\left(\ell_{j}^{d}+d\frac{\epsilon}{N}\ell_{j}^{d-1}+\ldots+\frac{\epsilon^{d}}{N^{d}}\right)\\
&=\sum_{j=1}^{N}|Q_{j}|+NO\left(\frac{\epsilon}{N}\right)\\
&\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E)+O(\epsilon)
\end{align*}
which shows that the outer measure of $\bar{E}$ is less than the outer measure of $E$. I still don't know if this is fully rigorous or not though.  It still has the problem that the argument for outer Lebesgue measure carries over by using $\ell_{j}'=\ell_{j}+\frac{\epsilon}{2^{j}}$ as each of the terms in the binomial expansion now are convergent infinite series and the result is still $O(\epsilon)$.  Moreover, we would still also have $dist(Q_{j},Q'_{j})=\frac{\epsilon}{2^{j}}>0$. So I guess that basically proves there's something wrong with my logic.  I just don't know how to fix it. (Update 2) So I have concluded there is nothing inherently wrong with my argument, just that it is incomplete.  For one thing, you cannot conclude that an ""$\epsilon$-close"" countable covering of a set $E$ can be ""$\epsilon$-fattened"" to produce a cover of $\bar{E}$.  The counter example is $[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}$.  The reason for this somewhat peculiar fact is illustrated in this question I asked earlier today ( Paradox as to Measure of Countable Dense Subsets? ).  But to put it summarily, countable coverings allow you to circumvent density arguments, in the sense that you can still cover $E$ while avoiding $\bar{E}$, and in fact do so on a set of positive outer measure; hence once $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, the fattened cubes will still fail to cover $\bar{E}$.  That this cannot happen in the finite case is made rigorous in the following (completely) redone solutions to (1) and (2).  Actually, fattening of the original cover of $E$ is not even necessary, as it is shown that a finite cover of $E$ is necessarily a finite cover of $\bar{E}$, leading to a new characterization of outer Jordan measure involving closed boxes only.  Moreover, we also obtain another surprising explanation as to why countable coverings can avoid this conclusion, the main idea being that countable unions of closed sets need not be closed.  The same arguments apply in reverse for the case of inner Jordan measure of $E$ and $E^{\circ}$, where it is shown that any containment by $E$ is necessarily a containment by $E^{\circ}$, hence leading to a new definition of inner Jordan measure involving open boxes only.  It is interesting to note that countable containments cannot avoid this conclusion (in contrast to the analogous situation for covers), and this stems from the fact that countable unions of open boxes are open.  Incidentally, we conclude that nothing is gained by considering countable containments, hence why we do not consider a Lebesgue inner measure. I will formulate this all into a complete answer once I prove (3). Let $E\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ be a bounded set. (1) By definition of $m^{\star,(J)}$, there exists a collection of boxes $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that both
\begin{align*}
E\subset\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E)+\epsilon
\end{align*}
hold for every $\epsilon>0$.  Now the definition of elementary measure implies $m(B_{j})=|B_{j}|=\bar{B_{j}}|=m(B_{j})$, and because $\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}\bar{B_{j}}\supset E,$ we may assume each $B_{j}$ is closed.  But this implies that the cover is itself closed since $N$ is finite, e.g. $\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}=\overline{\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}}.$  Moreover, as $\bar{E}$ is the \emph{smallest} closed set which contains $E$, we have that $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is an ``$\epsilon$-close'' cover of $\bar{E}$ as well.  It follows from monotonicity and the previous remarks that
$$m^{\star,(J)}(E)\leq m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})\leq\sum_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\leq m^{\star,(J)}(E)+\epsilon\leq m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})+\epsilon.$$
In particular, we obtain the estimate
$$\Bigg|m^{\star,(J)}(E)-m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})\Bigg|\leq\epsilon,$$
and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we conclude $m^{\star,(J)}(E)=m^{\star,(J)}(\bar{E})$ as required. (2) By definition of $m_{\star,(J)}$, there exists a collection of boxes $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ such that both
\begin{align*}
E\supset\bigcup\limits_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}
&&\text{and}
&&\sum\limits_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E)-\epsilon
\end{align*}
hold for every $\epsilon>0$.  Now the definition of elementary measure implies $m(B_{j})=|B_{j}|=|B_{j}^{\circ}|=m(B_{j}^{\circ})$, and because $E\supset\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B^{\circ}_{j}$, we may assume each $B_{j}$ is open.  But this implies that the contained set is itself open, e.g. $\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}=\left(\bigcup_{j=1}^{N}B_{j}\right)^{\circ}.$  Moreover, as $E^{\circ}$ is the \emph{largest} open set which is contained in $E$, we have that $\{B_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is an ``$\epsilon$-close'' set contained in $E^{\circ}$ as well.  It follows from monotonicity and the previous remarks that
$$m_{\star,(J)}(E)\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})\geq\sum_{j=1}^{N}|B_{j}|\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E)-\epsilon\geq m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})-\epsilon.$$
In particular, we obtain the estimate
$$\Bigg|m_{\star,(J)}(E)-m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})\Bigg|\leq\epsilon,$$
and since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we conclude $m_{\star,(J)}(E)=m_{\star,(J)}(E^{\circ})$ as required. (Some Remarks) These results allow us to redefine $m^{\star,(J)}$ as the infimal elementary measure of a cover of $E$ by a finite number of closed boxes, and $m_{\star,(J)}$ as the supremal elementary measure of a containment by $E$ consisting of finite numbers of open boxes.  These characterizations are are just as valid for countable coverings and containments.  However, to obtain the conclusion from (1), finiteness of the cover is essential.  The issue is that a countable union of closed boxes need not be closed, and so we can not conclude that the outer measures of $E$ and $\bar{E}$ coincide when countable covers are permitted.  The set $A=[0,1]\cap\mathbb{Q}$ is a typical example of how the conclusion of (1) can fail when countable coverings are allowed.  The Lebesgue outer measure of $A$ is $0$ since it can be covered by a countable union of degenerate boxes, while the Jordan outer measure of $A$ is $1$ since $\bar{A}=[0,1]$.  On the other hand, no problem occurs when finite containments are upgraded to countable containments.  This is because a countable union of open boxes is always open, and so the ""Lebesgue inner measure"" of $E$ must still coincide with the Lebesgue inner measure of $E^{\circ}$, since $E^{\circ}$ is the largest open set contained in $E$.  Moreover, every open set $\mathscr{O}$ is the countable union of pairwise disjoint boxes, and by being a union of such boxes (as opposed to an intersection), we see that every finite subcollection of such boxes is contained in $\mathscr{O}$.  It is easy to see then that the inner Jordan and Lebesgue measures of $\mathscr{O}$ coincide, and the conclusion from (2) implies that they agree for all sets.  Incidentally, this demonstrates our lack of need for an inner Lebesgue measure.  In fact, Littlewood's characterization of Lebesgue measurable sets being ``nearly open'' is basically equivalent to showing that the inner and outer Lebesgue measures are equal; in any case, clearly nothing is gained by upgrading finite containments to countable ones.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

The étale fundamental group of $U_{X}=\mathbb{P}^{1}_{k}\setminus \{0,1,\infty\}$ is then the profinite group generated by three elements $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3$, subject to the only relation

213606,definite and indefinite sums and integrals,"It just occurred to me that I tend to think of integrals primarily as indefinite integrals and sums primarily as definite sums. That is, when I see a definite integral, my first approach at solving it is to find an antiderivative, and only if that doesn't seem promising I'll consider whether there might be a special way to solve it for these special limits; whereas when I see a sum it's usually not the first thing that occurs to me that the terms might be differences of some function. In other words, telescoping a sum seems to be just one particular way among many of evaluating it, whereas finding antiderivatives is the primary way of evaluating integrals. In fact I learned about telescoping sums much later than about antiderivatives, and I've only relatively recently learned to see these two phenomena as different versions of the same thing. Also it seems to me that empirically the fraction of cases in which this approach is useful is much higher for integrals than for sums. So I'm wondering why that is. Do you see a systematic reason why this method is more productive for integrals? Or is it perhaps just a matter of education and an ""objective"" view wouldn't make a distinction between sums and integrals in this regard? I'm aware that this is rather a soft question, but I'm hoping it might generate some insight without leading to open-ended discussions.","['summation', 'integration', 'soft-question']"

213809,The same bit of trivial algebra in two different places?,"The Villarceau circles are things whose existence is surprising.  To find radii of Villarceau circles, I stupidly went through a bit of trigonometry and got a much simpler result than I expected, and then realized there was a glaringly obvious way to do it that I hadn't thought of. In the $xyz$-space imagine a circle of radius $r>0$ in the $xz$-plane, whose center is at a distance $R>r$ from the $z$-axis, and revolve it about the $z$-axis, getting a torus embedded in $\mathbb R^3$. The intersection of that surface with the $xz$-plane is two circles not crossing each other.  A line $\ell_1$ touches one of those circles on one side and another on the other side, and that line is in a plane parallel to the $y$-axis, and the intersection of that plane with the torus is the union of two Villarceau circles.  So I thought: let's draw a line $\ell_2$ touching both circles on the same side, and the other line $\ell_3$ touching both circles on the same side, and the distance from the intersection of $\ell_1$ with $\ell_2$ to the intersection of $\ell_1$ with $\ell_3$ is the diameter of the Villarceau circle.  So I thought: first, the distance from the center to the point of tangency of $\ell_1$ with one circle, is
$$\sqrt{R^2-r^2}.\tag{1}$$  Add to that the distance the distance from that point of tangency to the point of intersection of $\ell_1$ with the nearest of those two parallel $\ell$s, and that distance is
$$
\frac{r^2}{R+\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}}.\tag{2}
$$
So the sum of $(1)$ and $(2)$ involves finding a common denominator, doing some routine cancelations, getting
$$
\frac{R\left(R+\sqrt{R^2-r^2}\,\right)}{R+\sqrt{R^2-r^2}}
$$
and one more cancellation gives you $R$.  Then I realized that the obvious way to see that the radius is $R$ doesn't involve doing any of that. But I recognized that bit of trivial algebra from a routine calculus problem:
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \log\left(x+\sqrt{x^2-1}\,\right).
$$
Going through the usual algorithms, you get this down to
$$
\frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-1}}{\sqrt{x^2-1}\left(x+\sqrt{x^2-1}\,\right)}
$$
and again to one last cancelation to get $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}$. SO MY QUESTION IS: What particular commonality between these two problems causes this same bit of algebra to occur in both places?","['geometry', 'calculus', 'algebra-precalculus']"

For every $\epsilon>0$, the cubes $\{Q_{j}\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ of length $\ell_{j}=\frac{\epsilon}{2^{j}}$ centered at each $q_{i}$ clearly cover $E$, and we have $\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}|Q_{j}|=\epsilon$.  This implies that $m(E)=0$. This example is typical.  But here's my question.  The closure of $E$ is $\bar{E}=[0,1]$.  In particular, $\bar{E}\backslash E=\mathbb{I}\cap[0,1]$.  If we examine our cover, we see that to each $q_{j}$ we have placed a neighborhood of radius $\frac{\epsilon}{2^{j+1}}>0$.  Because $A$ is dense in $[0,1]$, for every $x\in[0,1]$, $B(x;\delta)\cap A\neq\emptyset$ for any $\delta>0$. In other words, the collection of balls $\{B(q_{i};\frac{\epsilon}{2^{j}})\}_{j=1}^{\infty}$ ought to cover $[0,1]$.  But if it did, then it would contradict what was shown above. How do you resolve this (for general countably dense subsets). This question arose from a related problem on a post I made regarding a question as to the relationship of outer Jordan measure a set $E$ and its closure $\bar{E}$, and can be found here: Closure, Interior, and Boundary of Jordan Measurable Sets. .  In particular, I want to know if it's possible to justify ""$\epsilon$-fattening"" a cover of $E$ to a cover of $\bar{E}$.  In other words, can we take a finite cover $\{Q_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ of $E$ by cubes of length $\ell_{j}$, and fatten each cube by no more than $|Q_{j}\leq|Q'_{j}|\leq|Q_{j}|+\frac{\epsilon}{N}$ and then claim $\{Q'_{j}\}_{j=1}^{N}$ is a cover of $\bar{E}$?  Apparently this should be true for finite covers, but it's clearly not true for countable covers because of the obvious counter example presented at the beginning.  But my justification for why it's true for finite covers carries over to countable covers (in that $\bar{E}\backslash E$ is a collection of limit points of $E$, so arbitrarily fattening up a cover should capture these points, hence cover $\bar{E}$). There must be something wrong with my thinking here, and I really need to get it resolved!
