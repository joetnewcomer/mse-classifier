962507,What is the flaw in both of my approaches to this limit?,"I have been solving a 3D limit problem: $$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \frac{x^2+y^2}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+1}-1}$$which apparently, is $2$.  However, I cannot find the flaw in my approach.  Here it goes:

I've solved this two different ways and I keep getting the answer as $(1+m^2)$.  The Student Solutions Manual , alas, says the answer it $2$.  Just in case my mistake lies somewhere after this step, even though I got the same answer solving it two different ways after this point I'll give you one of my methods, the shorter of the two:

962625,$2$-element subsets of $n$ elements?,"the question is as follows: Give a recursive definition for the number of $2$-element subsets of $n$ elements. We started working this out in class and here is where we got too: -if  $n = 0$, then we are looking for the $2$-element subsets of $0$ elements. There are none. So $f(0) = 0.$ -If  $ n > 0$, then our set looks like $S $= {$s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$}. Let's look at all of the $2$-element subsets of $S$. Some of them will include $s_n$. These sets look like {$x, s_n$}, where x is one of the elements {$s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}$}. As we have $n-1$ choices for the element $x$, we have $n+1$ 2-element subsets that contain sn. Others will not include sn. But if they don't, then we are looking for the $2$-element subsets of  {$s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n-1}$}, and we know that there are $f(n-1)$ of these. I know the recursive definition is: $f(0) = 0$ $f(n) = f(n-1)+n-1$ But I don't really understand what a 2 element subset is. Can someone give me an example of this/more insight into this problem?

962661,Numbers Made From Concatenating Prime Factorizations,"I came across the following curious problem while playing around with my calculator. Take any positive integer $n$; for this example we'll use $216$. Create a sequence as follows: Factor $n$ into its prime factors, listing smaller factors first and expanding exponents; $216=2\times2\times2\times3\times3\times3$ Create the next number by concatenating the first $d$ digits of its prime factors, where $d$ is the number of digits in $n$; $2\times2\times2\times3\times3\times3\to222$ Repeat until...? $222\to2\times3\times37\to233\to233\to\cdots$ The first thing that is easy to show is that you will always be able to create a $d$-digit number at any step. The sequence obviously stops once it hits a prime number. But can it stop for any other reason?

962898,On a Proof that the Splitting Field of a Separable Polynomial is Galois,"Prop.: If $f \in F[x]$ is separable, then the splitting field of $f$ over $F$ is a Galois extension of $F$. Proof: By induction over $[E:F]$, where $E$ is the splitting field. By previous results concerning finite extensions, we know it suffices to show that $[E:F] = |\text{Aut}(E/F)|$. If $[E:F]=1$ there is nothing to do. If $[E:F]>1$, then we can write $f=pq$ where $p,q \in F[x]$, $p$ irreducible and $\deg p>1$. Since $f$ is separable, $p$ is separable. Write
$$
p(x) := \prod_{i=1}^n (X-\alpha_i),
$$
where $\alpha_i \in E$ are different. Let $E_i := F(\alpha_i)$. Then $E$ is the splitting field of $f/(x-\alpha_1) \in E_1[x]$. Since $m := [E:E_1]<[E:F]$, the induction hypothesis tells us there are $m$ elements in $\text{Aut}(E/E_1)$, let's say $\text{Aut}(E/E_1) = \{\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_m\}$. There are also $n$ isomorphisms
\begin{align}
\sigma_i : E_1 &\to E_i \\
\alpha_1 &\mapsto \alpha_i.
\end{align}
Each combination $(\tau_j, \sigma_i)$ gives an element in $\text{Aut}(E/F)$. Hence there are $mn$ elements in $\text{Aut}(E/F)$. But $mn=[E:E_1][E_1:F]=[E:F]$. $\blacksquare$ Questions: Does $\alpha_i \in E\backslash F$ for all $i$? In fact, this is used to deduce $[E:E_1]<[E:F]$? I think the answer to both is yes and that $\alpha_i \not\in F$ follows from the irreducibility of $p$ over $F$ and from the fact that $e \in E\backslash F$ & $f\in F$ $\implies$ $ef \in E\backslash F$. To apply the induction hypothesis, we note that $E$ is the splitting field of $f/(x-\alpha_1) \in E_1[x]$. But is it not true that we have more simply that $E$ is the splitting field of $f \in E_1[x]$? When we say that each combination $(\tau_j, \sigma_i)$ gives an element in $\text{Aut}(E/F)$, what are those elements? I think it must be some compositions, but the domains and codomains of $\tau_j$ and $\sigma_i$ don't quite match...? Also why are those $mn$ elements different?","['galois-theory', 'splitting-field', 'abstract-algebra', 'field-theory']"

962956,Prove that a non-abelian group of order $pq$ ($p<q$) has a nonnormal subgroup of index $q$,"So I've come up with a proof for the following question, and I'd like to know if it's correct (as I couldn't find anything online along the lines of what I did). Question Let $p$ and $q$ be primes with $p<q$.  Prove that a non-abelian group of order $pq$ has a nonnormal subgroup of index $q$, so there there eixists and injective homomorphism into $S_q$ First I prove a Lemma : If $H\triangleleft G$, then for every conjugacy class $\mathcal{K} \subseteq H$ or $\mathcal{K} \cap H = \emptyset$. proof : If $x\in K\cap H$, then $gxg^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$ for all $g\in G$.  Since $H$ is normal $gHg^{-1}=H$, so that $H$ contains all the conjugates of $x$,i.e., $\mathcal{K} \subseteq H$ (Dummit and Foot, 4ed, pg 127). Here's my attempt on the question: proof : Let $G$ be a group such that $|G|=pq$ and $p<q$. Then $G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{pq}$, and so $G$ has two subgroups, say $H$ and $K$, of orders $p$ and $q$, respectively .  'Suppose that $H$ is a subgroup in $G$ of order $p$; a subgroup $K$ of order $q$ exists in $G$ by Cauchy (Nicky Hekster).'  Also, by Lagrange, $H=\langle x \rangle$ and $K=\langle y \rangle$ for some $y,x \in G$.  Since $p$ is the smallest prime that divides the order of $G$ and $|G:K|=p$, then $K\triangleleft G$ (by some theorem). Suppose, by contradiction, that $H\triangleleft G$.  Then for $x^i \in H$, $gx^ig^{-1}=x^k \in H$ for all $g\in G$.  So $H\subseteq \mathcal{O}_{x^i}$ (the conjugacy class of $x_i$).  Since $|x^i|$ divides $p$, then $x_i\not \in K$.  Thus $\mathcal{O}_{x_i} \not \subseteq K$.  Also, since $e=x^p$ and $gx^pg^{-1}=e$, then $e\in \mathcal{O}_{x_i}$.  Thus $\mathcal{O}_{x_i} \cap K \neq \emptyset$.  Therefore $K$ is not normal in $G$, which is absurd. Now let $\phi: G \rightarrow S_q$ be the permutations representation afforded by the action of $G$ on $A=G/H$ by left multiplication -- say $\pi_g:A\rightarrow A$ defined by $aH\mapsto gaH$ for all $g\in G, \; aH\in A$.  We know that $\ker \pi_g \leq H$ and $\ker \pi_g \triangleleft G$.  Since $|H|=p$, then $|\ker \pi_g|=p$ or $|\ker \pi_g|=1$.  If $|\ker \pi_g|=p$, then $\ker \pi_g$ is not normal in $G$.  Therefore, $|\ker \pi_g|=1$.  Since $\ker \pi_g=\ker \phi$, then $\phi$ must be injective.

962958,100 sequential parking spaces,"In my high school's math club today, we explored but did not solve this interesting problem: 100 autonomous robotic vehicles enter a warehouse in arbitrary order to park. Inside the  warehouse, there are 100 sequential parking spaces enumerated from 1 to 100. Each vehicle has an assigned number where it will attempt to park. However, there is an error in the programming such that if a vehicle finds its path to the assigned parking spot blocked by an already-parked robot, the robot will immediately park in the spot before it. For example, if vehicle 50 parks in spot 50 but vehicle 75 is immediately behind it, vehicle 75 will park in spot 49. Also, if vehicle 1 parks in spot 1, every robot behind it will be blocked from entering the warehouse at all. The vehicles do not have the ability to maneuver around already-parked vehicles. What is the most likely number of robots that will be parked in the warehouse at the end of the routine? So far the group came up with just some underlying intuition that the most likely number should be fewer than 50, as it is likely that some robot will park in position $\leq 50$ early on and leave many spaces unable to be occupied.

962971,Prove that the kernel is of dimension 2,"""Experimentally"", I found that the kernel (null space) of the following matrix is of dimension 2. I'd like to prove it, but haven't managed yet:

\mathbf{Q}_2=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & & \\  & \ddots &   \\ & & 1 & \\ & & & -1  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}

where (... sorry...):
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Omega=\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 & & \\  & \ddots & \\  & & \omega_n  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n},\quad \forall i\in\lbrace 1,\dots, n\rbrace, \omega_i>0

\mathbf{cos}(\boldsymbol\Omega t)=\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & & \\  & \ddots & \\  & & \cos(\omega_n t)  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}
\end{equation} Interesting properties of $\mathbf{Q}_1$ and $\mathbf{Q}_2$ : Obviously, $\mathbf{Q}_2$ is invertible and $\mathbf{Q}_2=\mathbf{Q}_2^{-1}$. Also, $\det(\mathbf{Q}_1)=1$ ($\omega_i>0$ and for proper $t>0$) and:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q}_1(t)^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}\textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & -\boldsymbol \Omega^{-1}\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) \\  \boldsymbol \Omega\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & \textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t)\end{bmatrix}

963061,Can the set of computable numbers be used as a theoretical basis for calculus?,"I recall from my Real Analysis course that the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ are not suitable for doing calculus, and I believe the reason was that $\mathbb{Q}$ does not possess the least-upper-bound property, which creates problems when defining continuity and computing limits of Riemann sums.  (This is discussed in more detail here: Importance of Least Upper Bound Property of $\mathbb{R}$ ) So, $\mathbb{R}$ has some desirable properties.  On the other hand, I think it also has some undesirable properties.  For example: $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountably infinite, which means we could never enumerate all real numbers, even given infinite time and space (as demonstrated by Cantor's diagonal argument) In contrast, the set of computable numbers is countably infinite.  This means that the vast majority of real numbers cannot be described in any algorithmic way.   As a consequence, it is impossible to represent the vast majority of real numbers in a computer algebra system, even given an unlimited amount of working memory. This seems like a philosophical problem for calculus, and I'd be interested to know whether anyone has found a viable alternative to use in place of $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, if we use the set of computable numbers instead of $\mathbb{R}$, can we define differential and integral calculus sensibly and avoid the limitations of $\mathbb{R}$ mentioned above? (After all, the ""important"" irrational numbers, including $e$ and $\pi$ and the algebraic irrationals, are all included in the computable numbers, so I doubt we'd miss out on any number we've ever heard of.) Note: The Wikipedia article on computable numbers (cited above) discusses this somewhat, but the details (as of this writing) are a bit sparse.  It mentions ""computable analysis"", a ""constructivist"" branch of mathematics that attempts to use computable numbers instead of $\mathbb{R}$. The article says: The computable numbers form a real closed field and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes. but it does not say precisely what the computable numbers can or cannot be used for, especially regarding calculus. Also, I realize that this question is entirely moot in practice, since finite computer memory means that we can only use computers to manipulate a finite set of numbers (ditto regarding our finite brains).  But it still seems interesting from a theoretical perspective.","['philosophy', 'analysis']"

Therefore there exists a partition of unity $\{\psi_{1},\psi_{2}\}$ with $\psi_{1}$ supported in $M-A$ and $\psi_{2}$ supported in $M-B$. Furthermore $\psi_{1}+\psi_{2}=1$.

Prove that the direct product $\prod A_i$ and the direct sum (coproduct) $\bigoplus A_i$ are not isomorphic. Here the product and coproduct are taken in the category of abelian groups.  So an element of the direct product is a ""list"" of one element from each group, and an element of the coproduct is such a list where all but finitely many terms are zero. This problem appeared on an algebra problem set a couple weeks ago and I haven't been able to solve it then or since then.  Any ideas? An initial observation is that the direct sum is of course a subgroup of the direct product.  But the direct product could be a subgroup of the direct sum as well!  For example let $I = \mathbb{N}$, and let $A_1 = B \times B \times B \times \cdots$ where $B = A_2 \times A_3 \times A_4 \times \cdots$.  Then

It also seems promising to appeal directly to the universal mapping properties satisfied by the product and coproduct.  The problem I ran into in this case was that the projections from the direct product to the individual $A_i$s and the inverse projections from the $A_i$s to the direct sum need not have anything to do with each other.

$$y_2 (z)=cy_1 (z) \ln(z)+z^{\sigma_2 } \sum_{n=0 }^\infty(b_n z^n )$$

But the reason that we did not do this in the first place is because it leads to something going wrong (such as dividing by 0 for one of the terms). Thus when we sub $y_2$ into the ODE since derivatives are like linear operators we will get exactly the same problem as we had before hand i.e. for one of the terms we will need to divide by 0, say. So how do we get around this problem? To demensionstrate my point consider example 7 in this document http://www.most.gov.mm/techuni/media/EM_03011_p2chap34.pdf The ODE is $(x^2-x)y''-xy'+y=0$
  The roots to the indicial equation are $r_1=1$ and $r_2=0$. And it can be easly shown that for a given root $r$ the reccurence relationship is:
  $$a_{s+1}=\frac{a_n(n+r-1)^2}{(n+1+r)(n+r)}$$
  when $r=0$ when have
  $$a_{s+1}=\frac{a_n(n-1)^2}{(n+1)(n)}$$
  Thus when $n=0$ we end up dividing by 0 and we can not use this method.
  When $r=1$ this can be solved to get $y_1=a_0 x$.
  Thus using $$y_2 (x)=cx \ln(x)+x^{r_2 } \sum_{n=0 }^\infty(b_n x^n )$$
  and differentiating it twice and subbing it back into the ODE we get:
  $$-xc+\sum (n(n-1)b_n+(n+1)nb_{n+1}-b_nn+b_n)x^n=0$$
  so when equating coefficients of $x^n$ in an effort to find $b_n$ we will get exactly the same recurrence relationship as before and thus not be able to find $b_1$ since it will involve dividing by 0","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'sequences-and-series']"

964092,"The ""Empty Tuple"" or ""0-Tuple"": Its Definition and Properties","(I would like to link to a previous discussion on the subject: What is A Set Raised to the 0 Power? (In Relation to the Definition of a Nullary Operation) ) In axiomatic (ZFC) set theory, we define the ordered pair $(a,b)$ to equal $\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}$. Then, we define the ordered triple in terms of the ordered pair: $(a,b,c):=((a,b),c)$. Similarly, we define the ordered quadruple as $(a,b,c,d)=((a,b,c),d)=(((a,b),c),d)$. In general, one can define the $n$- tuple using this nesting argument. To define $(x)$, Herbert Enderton's 1977 Elements of Set Theory suggests the convention $(x)=x$. This seems reasonable: note that if $S=\{a,b,c,d\}$, then $(a,b,c) \in S^3$, $(a,b) \in S^2$, you would also expect $(a) \in S$, which would be true if you defined $(a)=a \in S$. Finally, the ""Empty Tuple"" or ""$0$-Tuple"", $()$, is defined as \begin{equation}
()=\{\}=\emptyset
\end{equation} This is confirmed by The Wikipedia Tuple page as the correct choice of definition for $()$. Moreover, this agrees with the conclusion we discovered in the previous discussion , in which we decided that $S^0=\{()\}=\{\emptyset\}=1$. For consistency, then, it is pleasing to know that $()=\emptyset$. My question, however, pertains to the properties of $()$. I have listed some which I believe true: $(())=(\emptyset)=\emptyset$. Thus $(())=()$. The "" dissolution property "": $((),s_1,\ldots,s_n)=(\emptyset,s_1,\ldots,s_n)=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ Any others? Although this doesn't have to do specifically with the empty tuple, as a follow-up to the dissolution property, it would be ideal if it were true that $((a,b),c)=(a,(b,c))$ (both suitable definitions for $(a,b,c)$), and possibly also $((a,b,c),d)=(a,(b,c,d))=((a,b),(c,d))$ (which are all suitable definitions for $(a,b,c,d)$), etc. The reason I want (2) to be true is because certain definitions like the nullary operation require that
\begin{equation}
S^0 \times S^n = \{()\} \times S^n = \{\emptyset\} \times S^n = S^n.
\end{equation}
For this to be true, however, would require that  $((),s_1,\ldots,s_n)=(\emptyset,s_1,\ldots,s_n)=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$, i.e. property (2). However, I can't just ""want"" or ""believe"" these properties to be true; I need to prove them within ZFC set theory, using the set-theoretic definition of $n$-tuples. Any help with this? Thanks for reading my trail of thoughts, and please let me know if you see anything anywhere which is incorrect. Thanks! Edit 1: Looking at the ""Tuples as Nested Ordered Pairs"" section of the Wikipedia Tuple Page , I see they define $(a,b,c)$ not as $((a,b),c)$, but instead as $(a,(b,(c,\emptyset)))$. There are two thing strange about this to me: first why the nesting occurs on the right, and second why they choose to pair $c$ with $\emptyset$ instead of just writing it as $(a,(b,c))$. Any insight on this? I wish I could sort this all out. Thanks again! Edit 2: Chris Culter's answer points out a contradiction which may stem from the definition of $(a)=a$. Perhaps if we define $(x)=(\emptyset,x)=\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,x\}\}$ then all the desired properties, including the dissolution property, fall into place. So far we haven't been successful in letting $(\emptyset, a) = (a)$, however. But this is the property we need, i.e. we need $((),s_1,\ldots,s_n)=(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$ if we want $S^0 \times S^n = S^n$!","['relations', 'motivation', 'elementary-set-theory', 'definition']"

964206,Algebraic Structures: Does Order Matter?,"(I want to link to similar question with a very good answer: Question about Algebraic structure? ) An algebraic structure is an ordered tuple of sets. One of these is called the underlying set, and the others are operations of various arity . Since operations are functions, which are sets of ordered pairs, this is why we can interpret the components of an algebraic structure to be sets. For example, a group is a quadruple $(G,0,-,+)$ where $G$ is the underlying set, $0 \subseteq G^0 \times G$ is a nullary operation , $- \subseteq G \times G$ is a unary operation, and $+ \subseteq G^2 \times G$ is a binary operation. My question is why we choose an ordered tuple to describe the algebraic structure. For instance, does it make a difference if I define a group to be $(G,+,-,0)$, where I list the operations in order of descending, rather than ascending, arity? If the order doesn't matter, why don't we just define a group to be $\{G,0,-,+\}$, rather than an ordered tuple?

Conversely, if we are given a vector bundle of rank $n$ whose determinant is a trivial line bundle, this corresponds to a principal $\mathrm{GL}_n$-bundle whose determinant bundle has cocycles which are just coboundaries (not trivial). So how do we get cocycles in $\mathrm{SL}_n$? Edit. Here is an attempt to spell out the details in MarianoSuárez-Alvarez's comment. Consider the short exact sequence of groups $1 \to \mathrm{SL}_n \to \mathrm{GL}_n \to \mathrm{GL}_1 \to 0$. It is split in the sense that $\mathrm{GL}_n \to \mathrm{GL}_1$ has a section, for example $\lambda \mapsto \mathrm{diag}(\lambda,1,\dotsc,1)$. We obtain an exact sequence of pointed sets

because $H^i(X,\mathrm{GL}_n) \to H^i(X,\mathrm{GL}_1)$ is surjective for $i=0,1$. But this means that $0 \to \mathrm{Bun}_{\mathrm{SL}_n}(X) \to \mathrm{Vect}_n(X) \to \mathrm{Pic}(X) \to 0$ is exact, proving the claim.

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q}_2=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}_n & \mathbf{0}_n \\  \mathbf{0}_n & \mathbf{P}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}1 & && \\ & \ddots && \\ & & 1& \\ &&& -1 \end{bmatrix}\mathbf{P}  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{P}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is any invertible matrix. $\mathbf{Q}_1(t)$ is defined by: \begin{equation}
\forall t>0,\quad\mathbf{Q}_1(t)=\begin{bmatrix}\textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & \boldsymbol \Omega^{-1}\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) \\  -\boldsymbol \Omega\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & \textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t)\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{2n\times2n}
\end{equation}
where (... sorry...):
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol\Omega=\begin{bmatrix} \omega_1 & & \\  & \ddots & \\  & & \omega_n  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n},\quad \forall i\in\lbrace 1,\dots, n\rbrace, \omega_i>0
\end{equation} and the four blocks are diagonal, for example:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{cos}(\boldsymbol\Omega t)=\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega_1t) & & \\  & \ddots & \\  & & \cos(\omega_n t)  \end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}
\end{equation} Interesting properties of $\mathbf{Q}_1$ and $\mathbf{Q}_2$ : Obviously, $\mathbf{Q}_2$ is invertible and $\mathbf{Q}_2=\mathbf{Q}_2^{-1}$. Also, $\det(\mathbf{Q}_1)=1$ ($\omega_i>0$ and for proper $t>0$) and:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q}_1(t)^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}\textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & -\boldsymbol \Omega^{-1}\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) \\  \boldsymbol \Omega\,\textbf{sin}(\boldsymbol \Omega t) & \textbf{cos}(\boldsymbol \Omega t)\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} The initial equation can therefore also be written as:
\begin{equation}
\text{ker}\left(\mathbf{Q}_2\mathbf{Q}_1(t)-\mathbf{Q}_1(t)^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_2\right)=\text{ker}\left(\mathbf{Q}_2\mathbf{Q}_1(t)\mathbf{Q}_2\mathbf{Q}_1(t)-\mathbf{1}_{2n}\right)
\end{equation} So another way of solving the problem is to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of $\mathbf{Q}_2\mathbf{Q}_1(t)\mathbf{Q}_2\mathbf{Q}_1(t)$ with a multiplicity of 2. But I'm not sure this helps... Any clues would be greatly appreciated.","['matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'determinant']"
964381,The two envelopes problem,"Suppose you're given two envelopes. Both envelopes have money in them, and you're told that one envelope has twice as much money as the other. Suppose you pick one of the envelopes. Should you switch to the other one? Intuitively, you don't know anything about either envelope, so it'd be ridiculous to say that you should switch to the other envelope to maximize your expected money. However, consider this argument. Let $x$ be the amount of money in the envelope you picked. If $y$ is the amount of money in the other envelope, then the expected value equals $$E(y) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}x\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(2x\right) = \frac{5}{4} x$$ But $5x/4 > x$, so you should switch! The Wikipedia article says that $x$ stands for two different things, so this reasoning doesn't work. I say this is not a valid resolution. Consider opening up the envelope that you pick, and finding $\$10$ inside. Then you can run the expected value calculation to get $$E(y) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \$5+\frac{1}{2} \cdot \$20 = \$12.50$$ This means that if you open one of the envelopes and find $\$10$, you should switch to the other envelope. The $\$10$ doesn't stand for two different things, it literally just means $\$10$. But you don't have to open up the envelope to run this calculation, you can just imagine what's inside, and run the calculation based on that. This is what ""Let $x$ be the amount in the envelope"" means. The problem with the argument is not that $x$ stands for two different things. So what is the problem? Previous questions on stack exchange have given the resolution that I just said I wasn't satisfied by, so please don't mark this as a duplicate . I want a different resolution, or a more satisfying explanation of why $x$ does stand for two different things. Apparently there is still research being published about this problem - maybe it isn't so obvious? I think there's something subtle wrong with the premise. Because there's no uniform probability distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, statements like ""random real number"" are not well-defined. Likewise, I think ""one envelope has twice as much money as the other"" assumes some probability distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and perhaps our expected value calculation assumes that this distribution is uniform, which it cannot be ...","['probability', 'paradoxes']"

I have read this Product topology and standard euclidean topology over $\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent but I do not understand why you are allowed to assume that each of the subsets in $B^1_{\epsilon}(x_i)$ are open in $\mathbb{R}$. thank you","['general-topology', 'product-space']"

964472,How many players needed for the game to have the highest probability of finishing the fastest?,"Welcome to the fictional game of ""color-tag""; the not-so-fast-paced cousin of paintball Where marking your opponent is all that counts! If $A$ marks $B$ with his/her color, then $B$ will be permanently marked with $A$'s color,
but at the same time all other people marked with $B$'s color
will instantly be permanently marked with $A$'s color as well. The first one to have marked everyone wins, and the game is finished! $m<x$ where $m = 16$, and the number of players, $x$, is put in a room and assigned an unique color. With every hour that progress, all the players have a probability of $1 - \frac{m}{x}$ of successfully marking another player.
There is no limit as to how many times a player marks another player. In the event that $A$ marks another player, the player, that is being marked, $B$, is chosen at random; Although players cannot mark themselves. Now, I would like to know what the optimal number of players for the game having the highest probability of being the fastest. That is, how many players are needed for the game to have the highest probability of finishing the fastest? Sounds simple enough, right? It turns out that it sounds simpler than it is; At least in my ears. I've tried to warp my head around it, but I fail to find a viable approach. I started out by calculating $(1 - \frac{16}{32} * \frac{1}{32})^{32}$, thinking that $(1 - \frac{m}{x} * \frac{1}{x})^x$
was the way to go about calculating the fastest possible game with respect to the number of players.
I soon realized that there was no way that was going to give me anything near correct results, so
I came up with something along the lines of $\sum_{n=0}^{x-1} ((1 - \frac{m}{x}) * \frac{x-n}{x})^n$, which I hoped would get me somewhere;
But all it did was feed me an absurdly small number and make me realize that I've never been faced with a problem like this, and that I have no idea of how to solve it. Right now, I'm not even considering that I must find the cases with the highest probabilities of success, then cross check to see which is he fastest;
Which I do think is paramount in this problem, alas I know of no way to approach this. Any input (especially tag additions) is greatly appreciated! EDIT 1: Just to make sure there is no confusion:
If a player $A$ and another player $B$ both get to mark an opponent (opponents being all the other players) within a hour, then there is a chance, and it is allowed that $A$ marks $B$, and $B$ marks $A$. Marking another player happens instantaneously and simultaneously.",['probability']

964489,Need Help setting up a unusual related rates problem (Calc AB),"Currently I am doing a project in my calculus class where we create a related rate problem relating to 2 ideas pulled out of a hat and solve it(mine was a student(s) bored in class and souls). Being a kind of weird combination, the problem I came up with is: A student is sitting in one of the most boring classes in history. The class is so boring, that causes the students soul to be sucked out of his body. Every minute, the student loses 4 soul pieces per boredom level. Starting at a level of 0 boredom, the student becomes more and more bored at a rate of 5 boredom levels per minute. If the student's soul is made of 1000 soul pieces, what rate is the student loosing his soul when he has 700 soul pieces remaining? Originally, I thought I could simply solve this problem using a Pythagorean theorem setup where one side would the total souls, one side would be the boredom [the prime being the rate of it increasing], and my hypotenuse being the lost souls [the prime being the rate of it being lost]. When I started doing the work itself, I got stuck because there was no way to find my base value of the boredom side. My teacher told me that I had to change something in my problem and not use a Pythagorean theorem setup (Because there was no way of proving it was a triangle problem in the first place). Any ideas on what I should change in my problem and what type of problem it would be (shadow, volume, expanding area, etc)? I think I would have to treat this problem just like a velocity problem.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus']"

for each tick bite. a. What is the probability that you will not get the disease when bitten once? I know that the probability of NOT getting the disease is 99/100, so if it is one time you get bitten, then the probability that you will not get the disease when bitten once IS 99/100, right? Since it is only one time. b. What is the probability that you will not get the disease from your first tick bite,
and will the it from your second tick bite? I did (probability of NOT getting the disease) x (probability of getting the disease). So I got (99/100) x (1/100) = 99/10000 as the answer. Am I correct? I think the events are independent from each other.","['statistics', 'probability']"
964511,Calculating Moments,"The following problem is from a Schaum book on statistics. While I thought I did it right, I did not come up with the right answer. Therefore, I am thinking I did something wrong. Problem: Find (a) the moment generating function of the random variable $ x = \begin{cases}
    \, \frac{1}{2} &\text{ prob. 1/2} \\
    -\frac{1}{2} &\text{ prob. 1/2} \\
    \end{cases}
$ and (b) the first four moments about the origin. Answer: The moment generating function for $x$ is: $M_x(t) = E(e^{tx})$ Since $x$ can have only two values, this gives us the following function: $
M_x(t) = \frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{t}{2}} + \frac{1}{2}e^{-\frac{t}{2}}
$ Now to find the first four moments about the origin, I compute the first four
derivatives of $M_x(t)$. $ M_x'(t) = \frac{1}{4}e^{\frac{t}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}e^{-\frac{t}{2}} $ $ M_x''(t) = \frac{1}{8}e^{\frac{t}{2}} + \frac{1}{8}e^{-\frac{t}{2}} $ $ M_x'''(t) = \frac{1}{16}e^{\frac{t}{2}} - \frac{1}{16}e^{-\frac{t}{2}} $ $ M_x''''(t) = \frac{1}{32}e^{\frac{t}{2}} + \frac{1}{32}e^{-\frac{t}{2}} $ Now, let $u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4$ be the first four moments of $x$. $ u_1 = M_x'(0) = \frac{1}{4}e^{\frac{0}{2}} - \frac{1}{4}e^{-\frac{0}{2}} $ $ u_1 = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = 0 $ $ u_2 = M_x''(0) = \frac{1}{8}e^{\frac{0}{2}} + \frac{1}{8}e^{-\frac{0}{2}} $ $ u_2 = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} $ $ u_3 = M_x'''(0) =

964534,Proving that all entire and injective functions take the form $f = ax + b$?,"Prove that all entire functions that are also injective take the form $f(z)=az+b$ with $a,b\in\Bbb C$ . Solution: We take $g : \Bbb C^* \to \Bbb C$ , $g( z) = f(1/z)$ , which is holomorphic everywhere except the origin. Now, we try to find out what type of singularity is the origin for $g$ . If the origin is a removable singularity for $g$ , then $g$ is bounded on a closed disk centred at the origin, which implies that $f$ is bounded outside a closed circle containing the origin. But $f$ is bounded on this closed circle, because $f$ is continuous, therefore, $f$ is bounded. Since $f$ is entire and bounded, by Liouville's Theorem, $f$ is constant. This contradicts the injectivity of $f$ . So the origin is not a removable singularity for $g$ . Suppose now that $0$ is an essential singularity for $g$ . Then, by Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem, if we chose a punctured disk centred at the origin $D^*$ , then $g ( D^*)$ is dense in $\Bbb C$ . This implies $f (\{ \lvert z\lvert > r\})$ is dense in $\Bbb C$ . But $f (\{ \lvert z\lvert < r\})$ is open because any holomorphic mapping is an open mapping. Then $f (\{ \lvert z\lvert > r\})\cap f (\{ \lvert z\lvert < r\})\ne \emptyset$ , which is again a contradiction with the injectivity of $f$ . Therefore $0$ is a pole for $g$ . Since the Laurent expansion is unique, and the principal part of $g$ is the same as the analytic part of $f$ , it follows that the analytic part of $f$ has finitely many terms, which implies that $f$ is a polynomial. Since $f$ is injective, the polynomial can have at most one root. Because $f$ is not constant, we conclude that the only expression of $f$ can be of the form $f ( z ) = az + b$ , where $a, b \in \Bbb C$ and $a \ne 0$ . Original text image I'm a little confused at both the overall logic in this proof. Are we simply using $g(z)$ to make conclusions about $f(z)$ , because $g(z)$ is the reciprocal of $f$ ? Is the proof assuming that $f$ is injective and entire (all the while knowing that it has some sort of singularity at $z = 0$ ), and then trying to reach contradictions in the essential singularity and removable singularity cases? Then, once it concludes that $z = 0$ is a pole singularity, it reaches the conclusion that $f$ must be of the form $f(z) = az + b$ ? Also, more specific questions about the different cases: Removable singularity case: Why is $f$ bounded on the closed circle if $f$ is continuous? Am I missing something simple? Essential singularity case: Why exactly is $f(\{|z| > r \} \cap f(\{|z|<r\}) \neq \emptyset$ ? $f(\{|z| > r \})$ is dense, but how does $f(\{|z|<r\}$ being open guarantee that their union is non-empty?",['complex-analysis']
