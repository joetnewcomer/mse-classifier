2625532,Find the intersection of all $T_2$ topologies on an infinite set $X$,"Let $X$ be an infinite set. Show that the intersection of all Hausdorff topologies on $X$ is a topology, and find it (Hint: We are familiar with this topology). The best candidate seems to be the co-finite topology on X, as it is a subset of each of the Hausdorff topologies, and it fits the hint. However, I am having trouble proving that for every subset of $X$ whose complement is infinite, there is a Hausdorff topology which does not include it.","['general-topology', 'separation-axioms']"
2625539,Classify all groups of order 75 [duplicate],"This question already has an answer here : Construct a non-abelian group of order 75 (1 answer) Closed 3 years ago . I am trying to classify all groups of order 75. I am only allowed to use Sylow's theorems, and other basic facts (such as what groups of order $p^2$, $2p$ are isomorphic to, basic facts about direct products, etc). My attempt was the following: We have that $75 = 3 \cdot 5^2$. Sylow's third theorem tells us that the number $n_5$ of Sylow $5$-subgroups is congruent to $1 \bmod 5$, and must divide $3$. Therefore $n_5 = 1$, so we must have a normal (by Sylow's second theorem) subgroup of order $5^2 = 25$. Similarly we get that $n_3$, the number of Sylow $3$-subgroups, is either $1$ or $25$. In the case that $n_3 = 1$ it isn't hard to show that that the group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb Z_{25} \times \mathbb Z_3 \simeq \mathbb Z_{75}$, or to $(\mathbb Z_5 \times \mathbb Z_5) \times \mathbb Z_3 \simeq \mathbb Z_5 \times \mathbb Z_{15}$. In the other case when $n_3 = 25$, we have $25$ subgroups where the pairwise intersection of any two is $\{e\}$. This accounts for $1 + 25 \times (3-1) = 51$ distinct elements (including the identity) of the group, leaving $24$ elements. This is all I know for this case, and I don't know how to proceed. I appreciate any assistance.","['sylow-theory', 'group-theory']"

2625601,Showing that $\sum_{j=0}^{2n-1}{\cos^n(\frac{j\pi}{2n})(2\cos(\frac{2j\pi}n)+1)\cos(\frac{j\pi}2-\frac{2j\pi}n)}$ is never an integer for $n>10$,"I want to show that $$f(n) = \sum_{j=0}^{2n-1}{\cos^n\left(  \frac{j \pi}{2n}\right) \left( 2\cos \left( \frac{2 j \pi}{n} \right) + 1\right) \cos \left( \frac{j \pi}{2} - \frac{2 j \pi}{n} \right)}$$ is an integer only for $n \in \{1,2,3,4,5, 10\}$ . What I have tried so far is: Calculate $f(n)$ for each $n$ up to $16$ . The values above are the only values I have found that are integers. At $n = 16$ , the value is $\frac{1941}{2048}$ , just under $1$ . By computing $f(n)$ for $16$ and up, I can see that it is always decreasing and therefore is $\lt 1$ . If I can show $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n\ge 16, f(n) \lt 1$ , then it follows that it can't be an integer.

2625632,$n$th derivative of $\tanh$,"Successive derivative of $\tanh u$ can be expressed as polynomial functions of $\tanh u$:
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{du}\tanh u&=1-\tanh^2u\\
\frac{d^2}{du^2}\tanh u&=-2\tanh u\left(1-\tanh^2u\right)\\

\end{align}
I am specially interested in the derivatives of even order. Their expressions can be found in this article by Boyadzhiev:
Denoting $z=\tanh u$ and $C_{2n}\left( \tanh u \right)=\tfrac{d^{2n}}{du^{2n}}\left( \tanh u \right) $,
\begin{equation}
C_{2n}\left(z \right)=2^{2n}\left( 1+ z\right)\sum_{k=0}^{2n}\frac{k!}{2^k}S\left( 2n,k \right)\left( z-1 \right)^k
\end{equation} 
where $S(n,k)$ are the Stirling numbers of the second kind . We have also
$C_{2n}(0)=C_{2n}(\pm1)=0$. As $\tanh u$ is an odd function of $u$, they can also be expressed as
\begin{equation}
C_{2n}\left(z \right)=z\left( 1-z^2 \right)Q_{2n-2}(z^2) \tag{A}\label{eqA}
\end{equation} 
for $n=1,2,\ldots$. Then, $Q_0(z)=-2$, $Q_2(z)=-8\left( 3z^2-2 \right)$... 
One may establish the recurrence relation (with $Z=z^2
$):
\begin{equation}
Q_{2n}=4Z\left( 1-Z \right)^2Q''_{2n-2}-6\left( 1-Z \right)\left( 3Z-1 \right)Q'_{2n-2}+4\left( 3Z-2 \right)Q_{2n-2}
\end{equation} 
What else can be found about the family $Q_{2n}$? Are they related to  a well-known family of polynomials? Context:
Answering a MO question , an integral representation for $\zeta(3)$ appeared:
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^\infty \frac{u-\tanh u}{u^3}\,du=\frac{7}{\pi^2}\zeta(3)
\end{equation} 
It can easily be checked using the residue theorem, taking advantage of the parity of the integrand. This result can be generalized for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$ as:
\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^\infty \frac{T_{2n-1}(u)-\tanh u}{u^{2n+1}}\,du=(-1)^{n+1}\frac{2^{2n+1}-1}{\pi^{2n}}\zeta(2n+1)
\end{equation} 
where $T_{2n-1}(u)$ is the odd polynomial identical to the Maclaurin expansion for $\tanh u$:
\begin{equation}
\tanh u=u-\frac{1}{3}u^3+\frac{2}{15}u^5-\frac{17}{315}u^7+\ldots
\end{equation} 
up to the $u^{2n-1}$ term. This identity can also be checked using the residue theorem. Now, integrating $2n$ times by parts, one obtains the following representation
\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty C_{2n}\left(\tanh u  \right)\frac{du}{u}=(-1)^{n}\frac{2^{2n+1}-1}{\pi^{2n}}\left( 2n \right)!\zeta(2n+1)
\end{equation} 
With the representation \eqref{eqA} and the substitution $u=e^{-2v}$, one obtains
\begin{equation}
\int_0^1 \frac{v-1}{\left( v+ 1\right)^3}Q_{2n-2}\left( \left( \frac{1-v}{1+v} \right)^2 \right)\frac{dv}{\ln v}=(-1)^{n}\frac{2^{2n+1}-1}{4\pi^{2n}}\left( 2n \right)!\zeta(2n+1)
\end{equation} 
which provides another integral representation for $\zeta(2n+1)$.","['definite-integrals', 'riemann-zeta', 'polynomials', 'sequences-and-series']"

2625665,What is the algebraic structure of higher-order jet spaces?,"Firstly excuse any sloppiness here -- I'm not a mathematician by training so I've had a difficult time formalizing my question and tracking down relevant material. Consider a point in a smooth manifold, $p \in M$.  Linear approximations to functions passing through that point span the first-order jet space, $J_p$ which can be interpreted as linear maps over the tangent space at that point, $T_p M$.  Compositions of these functions manifests in a straightforward compositional algebra of jets where in local coordinates the corresponding Jacobians are multiplied together. Multiplying a compositional Jacobian by an element of the tangent space gives directional derivatives.  This action is exactly the action of first order forward mode automatic differentiation .  We can also take the adjoint of this compositional Jacobian and multiply it by an element of the cotangent space to give gradients.  This is similarly the action of first order reverse mode automatic differentiation .  Everything at first order is wonderful. My question concerns what happens for higher-order approximations to functions and the compositional structure of the corresponding higher-order jets. At higher-orders the partial derivatives of each order will in general mix whenever two jets are composed together, and then this composite object acts on a direct product of higher-order tangent bundles.  For example, at second-order the composite map eats two elements of the first-order tangent space, $u_1, u_2 \in T_p M$ and one element of $v \in T^{2}_p M$ and returns two first-order directional derivatives, $J \cdot u_1$ and $J \cdot u_2$, and one second-order directional derivative, $u_1^{T} \cdot H \cdot u_2 + J v$, where $H$ is the Hessian.  There is clearly some interesting structure here where the image of the second-order jets seems to decompose into $T_p M \otimes T_p M \otimes T^{2}_p M$ but my math isn't good enough to work out the general theory or find the right references. Does anyone know what kind of algebraic structure is at work here, either for the jets or the action of the jets, or can suggest appropriate references? The immediate follow up is then how does this structure admit adjoints?  If the above gives higher-order forward mode automatic differentiation, how would we be able to take the adjoint of various subspaces of jets (or jet tangent products) to enable higher-order reverse mode automatic differentiation? Using higher-order dual numbers I worked out the second and third-order behavior heuristically in Chapter 1 of https://github.com/stan-dev/nomad/tree/master/manual (again please excuse the mathematical sloppiness or poor notation) but I would love to have a better geometric/algebraic structure of what's going on.

Also, I allow $g_{ii} \neq g_{jj}$ for $i \neq j$ (the special case where $g_{ii}$ is independent of $i$ is called isothermal coordinates-and corresponds to conformal flatness of $U$).

2626086,Number of isomorphism classes of $\Bbb Z[x] /(f)$ modules $M$ with $M \cong \Bbb Z^n$,"Let $f \in \Bbb Z[x]$ be a monic polynomial, $n$ is a positive integer. Consider all finitely generated $O=\Bbb Z[x]/(f(x))$ module $M$ such that $M \cong \Bbb Z^n$ as $\Bbb Z$-module, are there only finitely many isomorphism classes of such $M$ ? If $f$ is irreducible then $O$ is an order in a number field. Furthermore, assume $O$ is the algebraic integer ring in this number field then the answer is positive by finiteness of class number. I tried to deal with the general case, but there are several problems such as that a torsion free module may not be flat and that $\Bbb Z[x]/(x^2-1) \not \cong \Bbb Z[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Bbb Z[x]/(x+1)$). Is there any counterexample? If not, how do we compute the number of isomorphism classes using class number? Edit: Thanks for the answer below, there exists some counterexamples. Here is some of my ideas about a possible positive solution for some cases after posting this question. Firstly, as $\Bbb Z[x]$ is a $2$-dimensional regular ring, by standard argument (classification of f.g modules over Iwasawa algebra up to pseudo-isomorphism) there exists a morphism from $M$ to $\bigoplus_{i} \Bbb Z[x]/f_i^{n_i}$ which has finite kernel and cokernel and $f_i$ is irreducible. One example is the standard map from $\Bbb Z[x]/(x^2-1)$ to $\Bbb Z[x]/(x-1) \oplus \Bbb Z[x]/(x+1)$ with cokernel $\Bbb Z/2$. Maybe good controls for kernel and cokernel can help. A similiar idea is to regard $M$ as a coherent sheaf over $X=\text{Spec} \ O$, so when $O$ is an order , there exists an open subset $U$ of $X$ such that $X_U$ is normal with finite picard group and we have good understanding for $M|_U$. As there also exists a structure theorem for f.g modules on $PIR$ (Pricinpal Ideal Ring), this can also be done for general $O$. The remaining problem is to analysis $M$ on $X-U$ (a finite set).","['number-theory', 'abstract-algebra', 'modules', 'commutative-algebra']"
2626096,What is the correct notion of unique factorization in a ring?,"I was recently writing some notes on basic commutative ring theory, and was trying to convince myself why it was a good idea to study integral domains when it comes to unique factorization. If $R$ is a commutative ring, and $a$ is a zero divisor, we cannot expect $a$ generally to have unique factorization in the ordinary sense, seen for example by the fact that $2*4=2$ in $\mathbb{Z}/6\mathbb{Z}$. But this only makes me think that instead of focusing on domains, we should just focus on element that aren't zero divisors. Indeed, we can let $R_z$ be the set of elements that aren't zero divisors. Then if $R$ is nontrivial, $R_z$ is a commutative monoid under multiplication that contains the units. Moreover $R_z$ has the nice property that any if $a_1\dots a_n = b$ is some factorization of $b \in R_z$, then all the $a_i$ are in $R_z$. In this setting, we can say that $R$ having unique factorization means that $R_z/R^\times$ is a free commutative monoid. In the case that $R$ is a domain, this agrees with the definition of a UFD. Now standard arguments about factorization of nonzero elements in domains seem to work just as well for $R_z$. For example in a Noetherian ring, every element of $R_z$ can be factored into some irreducibles times a unit. Similarly, the proof seems to go through that principle ideal rings are unique factorization rings (in my sense). So my questions are: Is what I'm saying correct? If so, why do we normally restrict to domains when many arguments go through for arbitrary rings with no more effort (as long as we are willing to ignore zero-divisors)? Are there other natural generalizations of unique factorization of elements of a ring for which analogous theorems can be proven without more difficulty? By looking at this question, I found this and this , which did have examples of generalizations of unique factorization to more general rings. The first one essentially considers a tame type of ring where zero divisors are not so bad in terms of factorization, and my impression of the second one is that it exerts a lot of effort trying to generalize the notion of unique factorization to the extent that it becomes significantly more complicated. Any suggestions are appreciated.","['abstract-algebra', 'ring-theory', 'prime-factorization', 'unique-factorization-domains']"

As I was reading my notes, I came across an example provided by my professor that I am confused about.

(I assume each edge that connects two components is a bridge and a bridge counts as two edges). Could you please see my thinking section down below, am I right with the way I solved the problem? - My thinking: Consider each bridge to have two arrows indicating two edges. In this case, I traverse 14 edges, so the degree of R4 is 14, am I right? Is this the way to do it? If yes, why not using the other (green) edge, using that edge can give us a shorter closed walk of 12?

2626198,How to solve an ODE using symmetry,"I have to solve the following simple ODE using symmetry methods:
$y''=0$ I have done the following: Symmetry Generator is given by:
$G = \xi(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + \eta(x,y)\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \label{eq:gen} \tag{2}$
then we need what is called the first order generator (G^1) is given as: $G^1=G+\zeta^1\frac{\partial}{\partial \dot{y}} \label{eq:firstGen} \tag{3}$
The quantity $\zeta^1$ is called the first order prolongation of the generator $G$.  Then there's the second order generator $G^2$.  That is,
\begin{equation}
G^2 = G^1 + \zeta^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial \ddot{y}}.
\end{equation} The Prolongations Before we move further, we need to understand the concept of the Total Derivative Operator: $D=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\dot{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \label{eq:5} \tag{5}$ NB: $DF(x,y)=F_x+y'F_y$ The $k^{th}$ prolongation is defined by: $\zeta^{(k)}(x,y)=D\zeta^{(k-1)}(x,y)-y^kD\xi \label{eq:Prol} \tag{6}$
where $\zeta^{(0)}=\eta(x,y)$ Using the above definition we get the following: First Prolongation \begin{align} 
\zeta^{(1)} & =D\eta(x,y) -\dot{y}D(\xi(x,y)) \nonumber  \\
& = \eta_x +\dot{y}\eta_y-\dot{y} \left( \xi_x+\dot{y}\xi_y\right) \nonumber \\
& = \eta_x +\dot{y}\eta_y -\dot{y}\xi_x - \dot{y}^2\xi_y \nonumber\\
 \label{eq:ProlOne} \tag{7}
\end{align} Second Prolongation \begin{align}
\zeta^{(2)} & = D\zeta^{(1)}-\ddot{y}D\xi(x,y)  \hspace{10mm} \text{$ \ddot{y}=0$  so the second term falls away} \nonumber \\
& = \eta_{xx}+\dot{y}\eta_{xy}-\dot{y}\xi_{xx}-\dot{y}^2\xi{xy}+\dot{y}\left(\eta_{xy}+\dot{y}\eta_{yy}-\dot{y}\xi_{xy}-\dot{y}^2\xi_{yy}\right) \nonumber\\

\label{ProlTwo} \tag{8}
\end{align} The Determining Equation: The \textbf{invariance criterion } is: 
$\zeta^{(2)}=0 \hspace{10mm} \text{when} \hspace{10mm} \ddot{y}=0 \label{eq:InvCrit} \tag{9}$
We expand \ref{eq:InvCrit} to get:
$\eta_{xx} +\left(2\eta_{xy}-\xi_{xx}\right)\dot{y} + \left(\eta_{yy}-2\xi_{xy}\right)\dot{y}^2-\xi_{yy}\dot{y}^3=0 \label{eq:Det} \tag{10}$
From \ref{eq:Det} we get the following system of equations which Bluman \& Anco refer to as the system of determining equations :
$\eta_{xx}=0\label{eq:a} \tag{a}$ $2\eta_{xy}-\xi_{xx}=0 \label{eq:b} \tag{b}$ $\eta_{yy}-2\xi_{xy}=0 \label{eq:c} \tag{c}$ $\xi_{yy}=0 \label{eq:d} \tag{d}$ The monomials From \ref{eq:d} we get:
$\xi(x,y)=A(x)y+B(x) \label{eq:11} \tag{11}$
where $A$ and $ B$  are arbitrary functions of $x$ we substitute \ref{eq:11} into \ref{eq:c} and to get:
\begin{align*}
\eta_{yy}-2A'(x) & = 0\\
\eta_{yy} & = 2A'(x) \\
\end{align*}
therefore we have:
$\eta(x,y)=A'(x)y^2+C(x)y+D(x) \label{eq:12} \tag{12}$ where $A, B, C, \text{  and  }  D$ are arbitrary functions of $x$ we substitute \ref{eq:11} and \ref{eq:12} into equations \ref{eq:a} and \ref{eq:b} to get:
$3A''(x)y+2C'(x)-B''(x)=0 \label{eq:13} \tag{13}$ $A^{(3)}(x)y^2+C''(x)y+D''(x)=0 \label{eq:14} \tag{14}$ We equate the powers of $y$ from equations  \ref{eq:13} and \ref{eq:14} to get the following system of equations: $A''(x)=0 \label{eq:15.1} \tag{15.1}$ $C''(x)=0 \label{eq:15.2} \tag{15.2}$ $D''(x)=0 \label{eq:15.3} \tag{15.3}$ $2C'(x)=B''(x) \label{eq:15.4} \tag{15.4}$ From \ref{eq:15.1} \ref{eq:15.2} and \ref{eq:15.3} we have 
$A(x)=c_1x+c_2 \label{eq:16.1} \tag{16.1}$ $C(x)=c_3x+c_4 \label{eq:16.2} \tag{16.2}$ $D(x)=c_5x+c_6 \label{eq:16.3} \tag{16.3}$ we substitute \ref{eq:16.2} into \ref{eq:15.4} :
\begin{align}
B''(x) & = 2c_3 \\ \nonumber
B(x) & = c_3x^2 +c_7x +c_8 \\ \label{eq:16.4} \tag{16.4}
\end{align} We use \ref{eq:16.1} - \ref{eq:16.4} to get the following equations for $\eta$ and $\xi$ $\xi(x,y) = c_1xy +c_2y+c_3x^2+c_7x+c_8 \label{eq:17} \tag{17}$ $\eta(x,y) = c_1y^2+c_3xy+c_4y+c_5x+c_6 \label{eq:18} \tag{18}$ The Generators The infinitesimal generator is defined as:
$X=\sum_{i=1}^{8}c_iX_i$ where $X_1=xy\partial x+y^2\partial y$ $X_2=y \partial x$ $X_3=x^2 \partial x +xy \partial y $ $X_4=y \partial y$ $X_5=x \partial y$ $X_6=\partial y$ $X_7=x \partial x$ $X_8=\partial x$ From here I am unsure what the next steps are.
I think I need to find the commutators for each pair of $X_i$ The Commutators \begin{align*}
\left[ X_1 X_2 \right] = & \left( xy \partial x + y^2 \partial y \right) \left( y \partial x \right) - \left( y \partial x \right)  \left( xy \partial x + y^2 \partial y \right)\\
= & xy \partial x y \partial x + y^2 \partial y y \partial x - \left( y \partial x (xy) \partial x + y \partial x y^2 \partial y \right)\\
=& 0 + y^2\partial x - (y^2 \partial x + 0 ) \\
=&0
\end{align*} Through similar calculations we determine each commutator.  The results are in the table below: \begin{array} {c| c c c c c c c c}
 & X_1 & X_2 & X_3 & X_4 & X_5 & X_6 & X_7 & X_8 \\
 \hline
 X_1 & 0& 0& 0 & -X_1 & -X_3 & -X_3 & 0 & -X_2\\
 X_2 & 0 & 0 & X_1 & -X_2 & X_4-X_7 &-X_8 & X_2 & 0 \\
 X_3 & 0 & -X_1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -X_5 & -X_3 & -(2X_7+X_4) \\
 X_4 & X_3 & X_2 & 0 & 0 & -X_5 & -X_6 & 0 & 0 \\

 X_8 & X_2 & 0& 2X_7+X_4 & 0 & X_6 & 0 & X_8 & 0 \\
\end{array} I have tried solving by finding canonical coordinates:
$$
X_1 = xy\partial x + y^2 \partial y
$$ We have determined, in the previous section that: 
$$
\begin{align*}
r_1 = \frac{y}{x}  &&\text{and} & & s_1 = \frac{-1}{y}\\
\end{align*}
$$ We now find $\frac{ds}{dr}$ using the formula: 
$$\frac{ds}{dr} = \frac{s_x + s_y y'}{r_x + r_y y'} \label{eq:1.22} \tag{1.22}$$
Substituting our values of $r_1 \text{  and  } s_1$ we have: $$
\begin{align*}
\frac{ds}{dr} = & \frac{0 + \frac{1}{y^2}y'}{\frac{-y}{x^2}+\frac{1}{x}y'}\\
\\
  = & \frac{y'}{y^2}\left(\frac{x}{y'-r}\right)\\
 \\
 = & \frac{sy'}{r}\left(\frac{1}{r -y'} \right)\\
  \\
  =& \frac{sy'}{r^2-ry'}\\ 
\\
ds\left(r^2-ry'\right) = & sy' dr\\
\\
\frac{1}{sy'}ds = &\frac{1}{r^2-ry'}dr\\
\\
\frac{1}{y'}\ln (s) = &\frac{1}{y'} \ln \left(\frac{y'}{r}-1\right)\\
\\
\ln s = & \ln \left(\frac{y'}{r}-1\right) \\
\\
s = & \frac{y'}{r}-1\\
\\
\end{align*}
$$ We now substitute our values for $s$ and $r$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ $$
\begin{align*}
y' = rs + r'\\
\\
= & \frac{-1}{x}+ \frac{y}{x}\\
\\
= & \left( \frac{y - 1 }{x} \right )\\
\\
\frac{dy}{dx} = & \frac{y-1}{x}\\
\\
\frac{1}{x}dx = \frac{1}{y-1}dy \\
\\
\ln \left( y - 1 \right) = & \ln x \\
\\
y -1 = & x\\
\\
y = & x+1
\end{align*}
$$ However when I try to do this with $X_4$ it all goes pear shaped:( $$X_4 = y \partial y$$ $$
\begin{align*}
r_4 =x & & \text{and} & & s_4 =  \ln y\\
\end{align*}
$$ Applying \ref{eq:1.22} to solve for $\frac{ds}{dr}$ :
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{ds}{dr} = & \frac{\frac{1}{y}y'}{1}\\
\\
 = & \frac{1}{y}y' \\
 \\
 \end{align*}
$$
But this was getting me some crazy solutions when I tried to apply the same method I had used for $X_1$ So I did this instead:
$$
y' =y\frac{ds}{dr}
$$
We now determine $\frac{d^2s}{dr^2}$ $$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d^2s}{dr^2} = &\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{y'}{y}\right)\\
\\
=& \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{y'}{y} \right)\\
\\
= & \frac{y'' \cdot y - y' \cdot y'}{y^2}  \\
\\
= & \frac{- \left(y'\right)^2}{y^2}\\
\\
= & -\left( \frac{ds}{dr}\right)^2
\end{align*}
$$ Now we let $\frac{ds}{dr}=z$ $$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dz}{dr} = & -z^2 \\
\\
\frac{-1}{z^2}dz = & dr \\
\\
\frac{1}{z} = & r + \alpha_1\\
\\
z = \frac{1}{r + \alpha_1}\\
\end{align*}
$$ Now this gives us:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{ds}{dr} = &\frac{1}{r+ \alpha_1}\\
\\
s = & \ln \left(r + \alpha_1 \right) + \alpha_2\\
\\
\ln y = & \ln \left(x + \alpha_1 \right) + \alpha_2\\
\\
\frac{y}{x + \alpha_1} = & e ^ {\alpha_2}\\
\\
y = & \alpha_3 x + \alpha_3 \alpha_1\\
\\
y = Ax + B\\
\end{align*}

This explains the double arrow. This transform, credited to Magnus and more or less at the same time to Plücker in the early 1830s, is detailed in many books/sites. See Appendix 1 for a comment about inversion properties displayed on Fig. 1. Fig. 1. : Inversion with center $C$ and power 1. Shapes in black are exchanged by inversion with shapes in red. The blue circle, called ""circle of inversion"", is the locus of invariant points. But there are ill-known features that I would like to gather. Moreover, I would like to enlarge this ""quest"" to interesting (not fully standard) questions/applications of inversion. For the initialization of this ""collection"", I propose 3 themes and a compendium of interesting facts: ""Champagne glass inversion"" : Fig. 2 shows how inversion with center $C$ and radius of inversion $k$ (we find back the large and the small fish, inverted images one of the other...) can be realized by a 3 steps $P\Gamma P^{-1}$ operation with respect to a paraboloid $\Pi$ , where: $P$ is the vertical projection from $\Pi$ onto the horizontal plane, and $\Gamma$ is the conical projection from $\Pi$ to $\Pi$ with center $C_0(a,b,a^2+b^2-k^2)$ where $(a,b)$ are the coordinates of $C$ . This non-classical way to describe inversion deserves an explanation that we have placed in Appendix 2. Fig. 2. Inversion by a conical projection $\Pi \to \Pi$ . ""Bubble inversion"" This is a cousin representation of the first one with a sphere instead of a parabola (see Fig. 3). It necessitates to use 2 steps with the two stereographic projections $S_N$ and $S_S$ from the North and South pole resp. with respect to the equatorial plane. Take a look at Fig. 3. Consider a certain figure, say the circle in red. It is transformed by $S_N$ into the circle on the unit sphere materialized by black little diamonds ; this circle is transformed in turn by $S_S$ into the blue circle on the equatorial plane... which is the inversive image of the initial red circle. Briefly said : $$\tag{$\star$}I=S_S \circ S_N$$ This shouldn't come as a surprise because stereographic projections are themselves 3D inversions. See ( composition of stereographic projections is inversion through the ball - a geometric way ) for a proof. Fig. 3. (planar) inversion realized by combining two stereographic projections (formula ( $\star$ )). "" How inversion transform is connected with linear algebra "" (in fact connected with item 1) ; this issue looks paradoxical because inversion is definitely not a linear transform. In fact, there exists a group, the anallagmatic group, with a $4 \times 4$ linear representation (also called conformal geometry group). Moreover, this group includes another category of non-linear transforms, translations. Reference: the very good book ""Riemannian Geometry"" by S. Gallot, D. Hullin, J. Lafontaine, 2nd edition 1993. Universitext, Springer, pages 175-176. Here is how this correspondence is done (Explanations will be found in this book or in the very interesting development by @MvG cited in 4a): $$\text{If} \ J \ \text{is the basic inversion (center 0, power 1):}$$ $$[J]:=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&0&1\\0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\1&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}.$$ $$\text{If} \ H_r \ \text{is the homothety with ratio} \ r \ \text{and center} \ 0: $$ $$[H_r]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&r&0&0\\0&0&r&0\\0&0&0&r^2\end{pmatrix}.$$ $$\text{If} \ T_V \ \text{is the translation by vector} \ V=\binom{a}{b} :$$ $$[T_V]:=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\2a&1&0&0\\2b&0&1&0\\a^2+b^2&a&b&1\end{pmatrix}.$$ All these transformations preserve the following quadratic form: $$q(x_0;x_1,x_2,x_3):=x_1^2+x_2^2-x_0x_3$$ where $x_0$ should be considered as a homogeneous coordinate (i.e., is there to take into account the projective dimension). The signature of $q$ being $(+++-)$ , we are dealing with elements of the group classically denoted $O(3,1)$ . This correspondence with 2D transforms can be extended in a straightforward way to higher dimensions (for $n$ D transforms, the correspondence is with $(n+2) \times (n+2)$ matrices). This reference (jump to slides beginning at slide 130) uses linear algebra in $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ . (specific to the 2D case): Complex representation : Inversion with the unit circle $S^1=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,|z|=1$ } as invariant circle is the map $$I : \begin{cases}\ \begin{array}{ccc}\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}&\longrightarrow&\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\}\\z&\mapsto&\frac{1}{\overline z}\end{array}\end{cases}$$ Result : Any (2D) rotation can be obtained as a certain combination of translations and inversions. It is a consequence of the following identity (as given in https://mathoverflow.net/q/19965 ) : $$e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{e^{i \theta} + \frac{1}{z}}} = - e^{2 i \theta} z. \tag{%}$$ If we conjugate both sides of (%), we get : $$e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{-e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{e^{-i \theta} + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - e^{-2 i \theta}\overline{z}. \tag{%%}$$ (The LHS of (%%) can be written in a symbolic way as : $T_{e^{-i \theta}}\circ I \circ T_{-e^{-i \theta}} \circ I \circ T_{e^{-i \theta}} \circ I$ ). If we take $\theta=0$ in (%%), one gets : $$1+ \frac{1}{\overline{-1 + \frac{1}{\overline{1 + \frac{1}{\overline{z}}}}}} = - \overline{z}. \tag{%%%}$$ (Please note the conjugation bar).

Appendix 1: Recall of properties of inversion as depicted by Fig. 1: The image of a straight line is in general a circle passing through the pole $C$ ; exceptionally, when the straight line passes through the origin, its image is the line itself (caution: in the latter case, the straight line is ""globally"" invariant, but its points, in general, aren't invariant). The image $\Gamma'$ of a circle $\Gamma$ not passing through the origin is a circle of the same type (caution: the center of $\Gamma'$ is not the image of the center of $\Gamma$ ; nevertheless these centers are aligned with the pole of inversion). The image of a circle passing through the origin is a straight line, as said before. The image of the black fish made of line segments is the red fish made of circular arcs swimming in its blue round fishbowl. Appendix 2: Explanation of inversion depicted in Fig. 2. Let us begin by another definition of inversion. $$\tag{3}J_{C,k}:M \to M' \ \ \ \  \iff \ \ \ \ \  \exists  \vec{U} \ \text{(unit norm vector) s.t.} \ \begin{cases}\vec{CM}=\lambda \vec{U}\\ \vec{CM'}=\lambda' \vec{U}\end{cases} \ \text{and}  \ \lambda\lambda'=k^2$$ Let $M(x,y)$ and $M'(x',y')$ exchanged by inversion $J_{C,k}$ . Let $M_0(x,y,x^2+y^2)$ and $M_0'(x',y',x'^2+y'^2)$ be their ""lifted version"" on paraboloid $\Pi$ . Let $N(X,Y,Z) $ be any point of line $C_0M_0$ . We can define an abscissa $\mu$ on this line for point $N$ in the following way: $$\tag{$\star$}\vec{C_0N}=\mu \vec{C_0M_0} \ \ \ \ \iff \ \ \ \ \begin{cases}X=a+\mu(x-a)\\ Y=b+\mu(y-b)\\ Z=c+\mu(x^2+y^2-c)\end{cases}$$ with $$c:=a^2+b^2-k^2.$$ Please note that for $\mu=1$ , $N$ is in $M_0$ . Let $\lambda'$ be the value of $\mu$ associated with $M'_0$ . Thus $N \in \Pi$ in two cases: when $\mu=1$ ( $N=M_0$ ) and when $\mu=\lambda'$ ( $N=M'_0$ ). As $$\tag{3}N \in \Pi \ \iff \ Z=X^2+Y^2,$$ plugging in (3) the expressions of $X,Y,Z$ in $(\star)$ , and replacing $c$ by its defining expression, we obtain the following quadratic equation with unknown $\mu$ : $$\mu^2[(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2] \ + \ \mu[\cdots] \ + \ k^2=0$$ Using the classical formula for the roots' product, we have $$\lambda' \times 1 =\dfrac{k^2}{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=\dfrac{k^2}{\|\vec{CM}\|^2}$$ We find back here the definition of inversion given in (2) (recall that $\vec{CM}$ hasn't been normalized).","['circles', 'big-list', 'inversive-geometry', 'geometry', 'conformal-geometry']"

2626405,Understanding a proposition about $\mathcal R$-section in ordered sets (VERY EDITED),"The correct title must be: Proof of Theorem 90 of Appendix of Kelley's book General Topology or, Proving a theorem about $\mathcal R$-sections or Prove of this prove that proof aboutTheorem 90 of Appendix of Kelley's book General Topology . Proposition. Let $(X,\mathcal R)$ be an ordered set (or class). If $Y\subset X$ is an $\mathcal R$-section and every element $y\in Y$ is also an $\mathcal R$-section of $X$, then $\bigcup Y$ and $\bigcap Y$ are $\mathcal R$-sections of $X$. EDIT 1: The statement was misunderstood by me. The real porposition is: Let $I$ non-empty (possibly $I$ is a set). If every element $y\in I$ is an $\mathcal R$-section of $X$, then $\bigcup I$ and $\bigcap I$ are also. So the comment of @WilliamElliot is unnecesary, because in any momment we have said $I\subset X$. And probably it may be false. In my opinion, $I$ plays the role of an index set. Addendum 1. This statement corresponds to the Appendix of J. L. Kelley General Topology , Theorem 90 (p. 264). EDIT 2: Below is the rest of my question. Whit the new remarks it has no sense.
My problem is that I can't understand why (or how) an element $y\in Y$ can be an $\mathcal R$-section of $X$ if $y$ is not a subset of $X$ (as least as far as I know). It would have sense for me if the text said $\{y\}$, which is actually a subset of $X$. The same applies to $\bigcup Y$ and $\bigcap Y$: by DEFINITION, both are sets (classes) formed by elements of sets in $Y$: $$
\bigcup Y= \{x:\exists y\in Y \mbox{ such that } x\in y\}\\
\bigcap Y= \{x|x\in y \;\forall y\in Y\}.
$$ Again, to be an $\mathcal R$-section, we should consider $\{\bigcup Y\}$ and $\{\bigcap Y\}$. Addendum 2. (Real questions) Once I have understood the proposition, the result seems me evident. However, I don't know how how to prove it rigorously. I know I have a collection of sets $\{y:y\in I\}$ such that $$ \mbox{if } y_1,y_2\in Y \mbox{ with } y_1\neq y_2 \Longrightarrow y_1\subset y_2 \mbox{ or } y_2\subset y_1 , $$ So I actually have a descendent chain of sets $$ y\supset y' \supset y'' \supset \cdots $$ 1.- Proof for $\bigcup I$. With the above in mind, I think $bigcup I = y$ which is an $\mathcal R$-section by hypothesis. 2.- Proof for $\bigcap I$. I think the definition of $\mathcal R$-section avoids there is some $y\in I$ such that $y=\emptyset$. So I think all them has a common element, the least element $y_0$, and thus $\bigcap I$ is non-empty. Now, let $x\in X$ and $y\in\bigcap I$ with $x\mathcal R y$ and suppose $x\notin \bigcap I$. That implies that $x$ is less than the least element $y_0$. But then, $x$ wouldn't below either to $y\in I$, which is a contradiction, because $y$ was an $\mathcal R$-section$. So $\bigcap I$ is an $\mathcal R$-section. Questions about this proof: 1.- Is the proof of $bigcup I$ correct? 2.- Is the proof of $\bigcap I$ correct? 3.- In 2., do you think I need to proove $y_0\in \bigcap I$? Is there a shorter proof? 4.- If all the inclusions are proper, then is it possible to show that $\bigcap I=\{y_0\}$? Definition. Let $\mathcal R$ be a well-order in $X$. An $\mathcal R$-section is $Y\subset X$ such that if $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ with $x\mathcal R y$, then $x\in Y$. Informally, a set (class) $Y$ is said to be an $\mathcal R$-section if there is no element in $X\setminus Y$ that precedes the elements of $Y$. Final Remark. I have prefered keep the old question and add the edits and corrections, because I think that is more proper. Sorry if it is a bad idea. Thanks a lot for your patience.",['elementary-set-theory']

The exercise: let $f:\Bbb R \to \Bbb R$ a $2\pi$-periodic function which: a)is continuous at $0$ and integrable at $[-\pi,\pi]$. b)$\hat{f}(n)\geq 0 $ for all $n \in \Bbb Z$ where $\hat{f}(n)$ is n-th Fourier coefficient of $f.$ Show that under these conditions the Fourier series of $f$ converges to $f(t)$ for Lebesgue almost everywhere in $[-\pi,\pi]$. Equivelently , $\sum_{n\in \Bbb Z} \hat{f}(n)e^{int}=f(t)$ for lebesgue almost everywhere. What i have done so far: 1st)We know that if $t\in Leb(f)$ then $\sigma_n(f)(t)\to f(t)$ where $\sigma_n(f)(t)=(K_n*f)(t)$ with $K_n$ the n-th Fejer kernel. 2nd)Since f is continuous at $0$ we know that $\sigma_n(f)(0)\to f(0)$ from fejer's lemma.
With this i get that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\sum_{k=1}^{n} (1-\frac{k}{n+1})\hat{f}(k)=\frac{f(0)-\hat{f}(0)}{2}$. Because $\sigma_n (f)(0)=\sum_{k=-n}^{n} (1-\frac{|k|}{n+1}) \hat{f}(k)$. 3rd)I have expressed the $s_n(f)(t)=\sum_{k=-n}^{n} \hat{f}(k)e^{ikt}$ in terms of $\sigma_n (f)(t)$ like this $s_{n+1} (f)(t)=\sigma_{n+1}(f)(t) +\sum_{k=-(n+1)}^{n+1}\frac{|k|}{n+2}\hat{f}(k)e^{ikt}$.

$$ f^*(\eta)(x) = Tf^{-1}\circ \eta \circ f(x).$$ Thus the commutative diagram becomes: Now since $Tf^{-1}$ is invertible, we can use $Tf$ to write commutative diagram as a fiber product. From category theory we can complete the diagram of the vector field $\eta: Y \rightarrow T(Y)$ and the tangent map $Tf: T(X)\rightarrow T(Y)$ to obtain Now due to the uniqueness of the fiber product up to isomorphism we see that $Y \times_{T(Y)} T(X)$ equals $X$ .

2626657,Defining connection from parallel transport,"I was struggling with the motivation for connection and found it more comfortable to think from parallel transport. In Wiki, parallel transport is a map between tangent spaces denoted by $\Gamma(\gamma)_s^t:T_{\gamma(s)}M \rightarrow T_{\gamma(t)}M$, where $\gamma$ is the flow of the vector field $X$. This map satisfies the necessary smoothness properties and also (*) $\Gamma(\gamma)_u^t \circ \Gamma(\gamma)_s^u = \Gamma(\gamma)_s^t$. This is the intuition in preserving parallelism along the curve $\gamma$. Finally, the connection is defined by
\begin{align*}
\nabla_X Y = \lim_{s \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Gamma(\gamma)^0_s Y-Y}{s}.
\end{align*} All of this makes sense to me. However, I tried to prove $\nabla_{fX+gZ} = f\nabla_X +g\nabla_Z$ and I don't know if I can do it without assuming that $\Gamma(\gamma)^0_s$ must be linear. My feeling is that the linearity of the map can be proven using condition (*), but I can't do it. Any help and hints are greatly appreciated.","['connections', 'differential-geometry']"

2626720,Uniqueness of ODE as a consequence of the qualitative behaviour,"I am interested in uniqueness results for ordinary differential equations. Let’s start with a basic example. Consider the initial value problem $\dot{u} = 2\sqrt{|u|}$ with $u(0) =0$. It is well known that this problem has infinitely many solutions. However if we make further assumptions about the behaviour of the solution we can get a unique solution to the right. Assuming for example that $u(t)>0$ for all $t >0$ we deduce that the unique solution is given by $u(t) = t^2$. We see, in some situations further knowledge of the behaviour of the solution is helpful to deduce uniqueness. The one dimensional case is for example discussed in this article . The special situation i am interested in is an ODE the form $\dot{u} = f(u)$ for a continuous function $f \in C(\mathbb{R}^n;\mathbb{R}^n)$. In this situation one can deduce the existence of solutions for a given initial value $u_0$ but  a priori there is no statement about uniqueness of this solution. In spirit of the introductory example it seems natural to ask if one gets uniqueness under additional assumptions. Let’s assume that there is compact subset $ K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the following assumptions hold. $f$ is locally lipschitz continuous in the interior of $K$. Every solution that starts in the interior of $K$ stays there for all time. Especially there is a unique global solution for such initial values. Given $u_0 \in K$ there is at least one short time solution of the initial value problem. Every of these solution fulfills $u(t) \in K$ for all $t \in (0,t_+)$. Therefore also for initial values on the boundary of $K$ once again one has a global solution. Can one deduce that given an initial value on the boundary the solution under above conditions is once again unique. Even tough we do only assume f to be continuous in a neighborhood of this initial value? Looking at some numerical calculations and the corresponding graphs i think this might be true. Some further questions: Do you know about a two dimensional system where one does not have uniqueness of solutions? And where one can rescue uniqueness with similiar assumptions? I do not see how to generalize the results given 1 to the multi dimensional case. Do you have an idea? Does the knowledge of a lyapunov function help? Some findings: Here one can find a theorem which is somehow what i was thinking of. So however one needs to verify a not so nice estimate on $f$ and its derivatives.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

One idea is to take logarithm of the expression: $$\log \left(\frac{\log (n!)}{n \sqrt[n]{\log 2 \cdot \log 3 \cdots \log n}} \right)=\log \left(\log (n!) \right)- \log n -\frac{1}{n} \left( \log (\log 2)+ \dots +\log (\log n) \right)$$ I suppose this is easier to work with though I still have no idea how to prove the limit.","['means', 'limits', 'logarithms', 'factorial', 'sequences-and-series']"
2627401,Does an immersed curve in general position has finite self-intersections?,"This problem comes from Hirsch's differential topology in page 67. ""Generically"" a $C^1$ immersion $S^1\to \mathbb{R}^2$ has only a finite number of crossing points. Then I want to ask if in general a $C^1$ immersion $I\to M$, where $I$ is an interval in $\mathbb{R^1}$ and $M$ is a $C^1$ manifold, has finite self-intersections. Intuitively, since the curve is $C^1$, it can not change drastically in a small enough neighborhood, then we can perturbate it a little near the limit points of self-intersections to obtain a immersed curve with finite self-intersections. I don't know how to prove it rigorously, even for the case $I\to \mathbb{R}^2$. Since this problem occurs in chapter 3,  the proof may need transversality theorems.","['manifolds', 'intersection-theory', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"

2627584,Conditional expectation: treating $X_1$ as constant?,"I have ben having this confusion for quite some time. Here is my question. For simplicity, suppose we have two r.v.'s $X_1$ and $X_2$ defined on $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P\right)$ and they are independent. I am interested in, say, finding an upper bound for $\mathbb{E}\left[\left|X_1 + X_2 \right|\right]$. In statistics/machine learning literature, often I see arguments go like this: We ""first treat $X_1$ as constant"", and $\mathbb{E}\left[ \left|x_1 + X_2\right| \right]$ is upper bounded by a constant/function depends on $x_1$, and then we treat $x_1$ as a random variable and ""take expectation wrt to $X_1$"". I have been self-studying measure theory based probability, and I have been trying to make this kind of argument rigorous but cannot achieve it. I am aware of Fubini Theorem, but we do not necessarily have product space/measure here. I am aware of conditional probability defined through Radon-Nikodym, but I don't see any connection. It seems that this kind of argument is using some sort of ""iterated integral"" but I can't formalize it.","['real-analysis', 'probability-theory', 'statistics', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"

I know that the difference of normal random variables is normal (since $\bar Y$ is normal), so I get a chi squared random variable in the numerator and then obtain the following result:
$$V(S^2)=\frac{2n(\sigma^2+\frac{\sigma^2}{n})^2}{(n-1)^2}$$

2627805,How to bound the dimension of the conformal algebra of a manifold?,"Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, $n \ge 3$. Let $C$ denote the Lie algebra of the conformal vector fields on $M$. It is known that $\dim(C) \le \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Robert Bryant said here that this can be proven using local calculations and the Frobenius theorem. I don't see how to implement this approach. Any ideas? (Or other elementary arguments?) I know that a vector field $V$ is conformal if and only if
$$ \nabla V+(\nabla V)^T=\frac{2}{n} \text{tr}(\nabla V)\text{Id}_{TM}= \frac{2}{n} \text{div} V \cdot  \text{Id}_{TM}.$$ In the case of Killing fields the situation is easier: 
$\nabla V$ is skew-symmetric, and $V$ is determined by $V|_p,\nabla V|_p $, so the dimension of the Killing algebra is not greater than $n+\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. In the conformal case, it is not true that a conformal field is determined by its value and its covariant derivative at a point. (This time the space of possible $\nabla V|_p$ is of dimension $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+1$). Also, in the conformal case we really need to use somewhere that $n \ge 3$, since for $n=2$ it can be infinite-dimensional.","['riemannian-geometry', 'symmetry', 'conformal-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'lie-groups']"

2627814,"Nested logarithm sequence $a_{n+1}=a_n+\log a_n$, growth rate","I have considered a sequence defined as follows: $$a_{n+1}=a_n+\log a_n$$ $$a_1=2$$ Surprisingly enough, its growth is almost linear, or, more precisely, it seems that: $$n < a_n < n^{3/2}$$ From numerical experiments, the growth rate for large $n$ is well described by a power law (as it's obvious from the previous condition), with the exponent being around $1.2$. Here's the plot of: $$r_n=\frac{\log a_n}{\log n}$$ for $n=10^3 - 10^5$. For larger $n$ we have, for example: $$r_{0.5 \cdot 10^6}=1.204993305$$ $$r_{1.5 \cdot 10^6}=1.194589226$$ $$r_{4.5 \cdot 10^6}=1.185287843$$ $$r_{10 \cdot 10^6}=1.179122734$$ $$r_{20 \cdot 10^6}=1.174129607$$ Can we (1) prove that the sequence obeys a power law for $n \gg 1$ and (2) find the value of $r_{\infty}$? Edit If, as Did says in the comments, the sequence actually obeys another law: $$a_n \asymp c n \log n$$ Then it would be interesting to prove and especially find $c$. From experiments: $$c_{10 \cdot 10^6}=1.113128774$$ $$c_{20 \cdot 10^6}=1.111029684$$ And the plot for $n=10^3 - 10^5$: Professor Vector suggested that $c_{\infty}=1$, which is possible even though convergence is really slow. Update: In a linked question I prove (kind of) that the following inequality holds for $n \geq 2$: $$a_n \leq (n+1) \left( \ln (n+1) + \ln \ln (n+1) \right)$$ This bound is quite tight.","['logarithms', 'recurrence-relations', 'asymptotics', 'sequences-and-series']"
