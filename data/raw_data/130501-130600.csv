2029083,Importance (applications) of functionals,Yes functional analysis is the study of functionals (up to some extend). Why we are so curious to study functionals? Some applications please for the motivations to me.,['functional-analysis']
2029089,Why is a locally closed subscheme defined in this way?,"I have started studying the theory of schemes using the book Algebraic Geometry I by GÃ¶rtz and Wedhorn. 
There, they give the following definition of a locally closed subscheme: Let $X$ be a scheme. A (locally closed) subscheme of $X$ is a scheme $(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ such that $Y\subseteq X$ is a locally closed subset and such that $Y$ is a closed  subscheme of the open subscheme $U\subseteq X$, where $U$ is the largest open subset of $X$ which contains $Y$ and in which $Y$ is closed (i.e., $U$ is the complement of $\overline{Y}\setminus Y$). We then have a natural morphism of schemes $Y\to X$. My question is the following: why do they take explicitly the largest possible $U$? This seems unnatural to me. Does it make a difference if one takes any open subset $V$ such that $Y$ is a closed subscheme of $V$? Is it not the same, after composing with the inclusion $V\to U$? I think that this probably has some meaning, so there must be some subtle point which I am missing. I have looked it up in other books and, for example, in EGA I the definition is essentially the same. In contrast, the book by Bosch defines a locally closed subscheme as a closed subscheme of an open subscheme ( any , not necessarily the largest possible).","['schemes', 'algebraic-geometry', 'definition']"
2029163,$\frac{1}{n}$ as a difference of Egyptian fractions with all denominators $<n$,"Is there a good characterization of the set $S$ of positive integers $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ can be represented as a difference of Egyptian fractions with all denominators $< n$?
For example, $44 \in S$ because
$$ \dfrac{1}{44} = \left( \frac{1}{33} + \frac{1}{12}\right) - \frac{1}{11} $$ If I'm not mistaken, the first few members of $S$ are
$$ 6, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21, 24, 28, 30, 33, 35, 36, 40, 42, 44, 45 $$
This does not appear to be in the OEIS yet; I intend to submit it soon.
[ EDIT: It is now in OEIS as A278638 .] Here are some things I know so far: If $n \in S$, then $mn \in S$ for any positive integer $m$. $mn \in S$ for integers $m,n$ with  $n < m < 2 n$, because $$\dfrac{1}{mn} = \dfrac{1}{n(m-n)} - \dfrac{1}{m(m-n)}$$ $S$ contains no prime or prime power. There are no members of the form $2p^k$ where $p$ is a prime $> 3$. There are no members of the form $3p^k$ where $p$ is a prime $> 11$.","['number-theory', 'egyptian-fractions', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2029189,Need some examples of self-similar algebraic objects with special properties,"My knowledge in formal logic being too bad, let me define some concepts informally: Let $A$ be some object of type $T$ (like, a set, a topological space, a group, a lie algebra, or everything you could think about). We say that $A$ is self-similar if there exists a strict subobject $B$ of $A$ of the same type $T$ (like, a subset, a subspace with subspace topology, a subgroup, a sub lie algebra, ...) that is $T$-isomorphic to $A$. That is, $A$ embeds into itself strictly. Examples: any infinite set, $(\mathbb{Z},+,0)$ seen as a group, $]0,1[$ seen as a topological space, $\ldots$ Call ss-subobject of $A$ any strict subobject $B$ of $A$ isomorphic to $A$. Now, we say that a self-similar object $A$ is maternal if there exists a maximal (for inclusion) ss-subobject $B$ (by this, I mean that $B$ is maximal in the poset of self-similar subobject of $A$, I don't care if $B$ isn't maximal in the lattice of non necessarily self-similar subobjects). Examples: any infinite set, $(\mathbb{Z},+,0)$, $\mathbb{Q}$ seen as a topological space or a totally order set. Non examples: $]0,1[$, the cantor set, $\ldots$ Finally, we say that a self-similar object $A$ is densely self-similar if for any ss-subobjects $B$ and $C$ of $A$ with $B < C$ (inclusion), there exists a ss-subobject $D$ with $B < D < C$. Example: $]0,1[$ as a topological space. It is clear that if $A$ is densely self-similar, then $A$ is not maternal (by contradiction). Generally, does anyone have an example of non maternal $A$ that is non densely self-similar ? More specifically, can we find an algebraic (i.e., non topological) example of non maternal structure $A$ ? Same for densely self-similar ?","['abstract-algebra', 'general-topology']"

2029294,Skyscrapper sheaf and generalization of points,"Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unity and $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ together with its structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$. Let $\operatorname{Sky}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ be the skyscrapper sheaf and suppose that $\operatorname{Sky}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ is a quasicoherent sheaf of $\mathcal{O}_X$-modules. I want to show that $x$ does no admit a non trivial generalizations. Suppose that there is some $y \neq x$ such that $y \in \overline{\{ x \}}$. Then the stalk  $\operatorname{Sky}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})_{y} \cong \mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ by definition of skyscrapper sheaf. Since this sheaf is quasicoherent and $X$ is affine it must be isomorphic to the sheaf associated to the $A$-module $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$. Let $x=\mathfrak{p}$, and $y=\mathfrak{m}$ (we may assume $y$ to be a maximal ideal) then it is clear that,

2029378,On the asymptotic behaviour of the Cauchy product of harmonic numbers $\sum_{k=1}^n H_k H_{n-k+1}$,"In this post we take in our hands two simple tools. The first is the generating function of the harmonic numbers, you can see it in this Wikipedia, section 3, that holds for $|z|<1$. The second is the Cauchy product formula $$ \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n \right)  \left( \sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n \right) =  \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_k b_{n-k+1},$$ where the convergence is assumed, there are theorems that tell you when is convergent. In our case our factors are convergents because are the same, and this is well defined: we consider the square of the generating function and after we take the integral $\int_0^{1/2}$ to get if there are no mistakes $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{(n+2)2^{n+2}}\sum_{k=1}^{n}H_k H_{n-k+1}=\int_0^{1/2}\left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty H_n z^n\right)^2 dz=\int_0^{1/2}\left(\frac{\log(1-z)}{1-z}\right)^2 dz.$$ Notice that is required use the Cauchy product and swap the sign of the series and integral. The integral in RHS is computed in a closed form as $2(\log 2-1)^2$. I don't know if is well known from the literature this sequence $$\sum_{k=1}^n H_k H_{n-k+1}.$$ The sequence starts as $1,3, \frac{71}{12}, \frac{29}{3}, \frac{638}{45}, \frac{349}{18}, \frac{14139}{560}, \frac{79913}{2520}\ldots$ And I would like to know what's about its asymptotic behaviour.

2029485,"Conversion from Cartesian to spherical coordinates, calculation of volume by triple integration","Compute volume of the function $(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}+z^{4}=y$ Attempted solution: $y$ is the sum of a square and a fourth power, clearly $y$ is positive. since the object consists of positive y, the object will occupy 2 quadrants in its proj. on xy plane and it will occupy 2 quadrants on zy plane. the object will have azimuth and co-latitude and distance: $0\le\phi\le\pi,\\ 0\le \theta\le\pi\\ \rho\ge0 $ Now to convert directly to spherical coordinates is my problem, as I understand it, it is easier to convert from Cartesian to cylindrical, and then from cylindrical to spherical. the conversion from Cartesian to cylindrical is as follows: $$x=rcos\theta,\\y=rsin\theta,\\z=z$$
Thus the function $(x^2+y^2)^2+z^4=y$ becomes $$(r^2cos^2\theta+r^2sin^2\theta)^2+z^4=rsin\theta$$
$$(r^2)^2*(1)+z^4=rsin\theta\\r^4+z^4=rsin\theta$$ Now To convert from cylindrical to spherical we may use:
$$r=\rho sin\phi,\\\theta=\theta,\\z=\rho cos\phi$$ We get 
$$\rho^4 sin^4\phi+\rho^4cos^4\phi=\rho sin\theta sin\theta\\\rho^3(sin^4\phi+cos^4\phi)=sin^2\theta\\\rho=\sqrt[3]{\frac{sin^2\theta}{sin^4\phi+cos^4\phi}}$$ the largest value of $sin^nu$ and $cos^nu$ is 1, thus the largest value of $\rho$ is $\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}}$ Thus the limits of integration are $$0\le \phi \le\pi,\\0\le\theta\le\pi.\\0\le\rho\le\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}}$$ What knowledge I would like mathstack's to share; Is this an okay method to convert to spherical coordinates?

2029494,A basic theorem on Morse Theory: diffeomorphism between two manifolds with boundary induced by a map on a manifold,"I'm trying to understand the following theorem from ""Morse Theory"" by John Milnor: Theorem 3.1 Let f be a smooth real valued function on a manifold M. Let $a<b$ and suppose that the set $f^{-1}[a,b]$ is compact, and contains no crtitical points of f. Then $M^{a}$ is diffeomorphic to $M^{b}$, where $M^{a}=f^{-1}(-\infty,a]$ ed $M^{b}=f^{-1}(-\infty,b]$ Now I'll write the proof I found in the book: Choose a Riemannian metric M; and let $<X,Y>$ denote the inner product of two tangent vectors, as determined by this metric. The gradient of f is the vector field $grad f$ on M which is characterized by the identity $<X,grad f>=X(f)$ for any vector field X. This vector field f vanishes precisely at the critical points of f.
Let $\rho:M\rightarrow R$ be a smooth function which is equal to $\frac{1}{<grad f, grad f>}$ throughout the compact set $f^{-1}[a,b]$; and which vanisches outside of a compact neighborhood of this set. Then the vector field X, defined by
$X(q)$=$\rho (q) grad f(q)$ generates a 1-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of M, that is to say a $C^{\infty}$ map $\phi:R\times M\rightarrow M$ such that - for each t$\in R$ the map $\phi_{t}:M\rightarrow M$ defined by $\phi_{t}(q)=\phi(t,q)$ is a diffeomorphism of M onto itself - for all $t,s \in R$ we have $\phi_{t+s}=\phi_{t}\circ \phi_{s}$ For fixed $q\in M$ consider the function $t\rightarrow f(\phi_{t}(q))$. If $\phi_{t}(q)$ lies in the set $f^{-1}[a,b]$, then $\frac{df(\phi_{t}(q))}{dt}=<\frac{d(\phi_{t}(q))}{dt}(f),grad f>=<X,grad f>= 1$ Thus the correspondence $t\rightarrow f(\phi_{t}(q)$ is linear with derivative 1 as long as $f(\phi_{t}(q))$ lies between a and b. Now consider the diffeomorphism $\phi_{b-a}:M\rightarrow M$. Clearly this carries $M^{a}$ diffeomorphically onto $M^{b}$. Now let's come to the question: It is not clear to me why the last sentence is true. I thought to show that the image of $M^{a}$ through the restriction of $\phi_{b-a}$ to $M^{a}$  is 
contained in $M^{b}$. In order to do that I proved that $f^{-1}(a)$ is sent to $f^{-1}(b)$ through $\phi_{b-a}$ by using the fact we proved"" ...Thus the correspondence $t\rightarrow f(\phi_{t}(q)$ is linear with derivative 1 as long as $f(\phi_{t}(q))$ lies between a and b.

2029513,Geometry behind least squares under constraints,"I'm trying to solve the following minimisation problem by Lagrange multipliers. My questions is: How to interpret the solutions geometrically? Given a dataset $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb R^d$, a parameter vector $\theta \in \mathbb R^d$ and some $b \in \mathbb R^d$, I want to minimise
$$J(\theta) = \sum_{k=1}^n \lVert \theta - x_k \rVert^2$$ with respect to $\theta$ under the constraints $\theta^T b = 0$, $\lVert \theta - c \rVert^2 = 1$. For 1., I put $\mathcal L(\theta,\lambda) = J(\theta) - \lambda \theta^T b$, $\lambda \in \mathbb R$, and set $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\mathcal L(\theta,\lambda)
=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \lVert \theta - x_k \rVert^2
- \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \lambda \theta^T b
=\sum_{k=1}^n 2(\theta-x_k) - \lambda b = 0.$$ I'm somewhat shaky about the vector calculus, but I hope it's correct? Anyway, this is equivalent to $n \theta - n \bar x = \frac{1}{2} \lambda b$  and gives $\theta_0 = \frac{1}{2n} \lambda b + \frac{1}{n} \bar x $ where $\bar x$ is the sample mean. $\theta_0$ satisfies $\nabla J(\theta) = \lambda \nabla \theta^T b$. By the constraint ${\theta_0}^T b = 0$ we get
$\lambda = -2 {\bar x}^T \frac{b}{\lVert b \rVert}$. Finally, this yields
$$\theta_0 = \frac{1}{n} \bar x \left(1-\frac{b}{\lVert b \rVert}\right).$$ For 2. I get $$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\mathcal L(\theta,\lambda)
=\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \lVert \theta - x_k \rVert^2
- \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \lVert \theta - c \rVert^2 - 1
=\sum_{k=1}^n 2(\theta-x_k) - 2 \lambda (\theta - c)b.$$ Setting this equal to zero gives
$$\theta_0 = \frac{1}{n-\lambda}\left(n \bar x + \lambda c\right).$$ It looks rather messy to feed this into the constraint to compute $\lambda$. Is there some trick I'm missing?

2029541,When y is a function of itself,"When playing around with equations, I've twice found myself in the dilemma where my dependent variable is dependent on itself. In the first instance of this occurring, I spent hours trying things but I concluded algebra could no longer help, so I used Microsoft excel to recursively apply the function for discrete values (small changes in $x$) and referred to the previous cell's value of the dependent variable. I was able to attain a solution this way. However, now that I've come across this problem again in a different context, I would like to understand a bit more about it and if it's possible to solve with math alone. Let me recount to you the dilemma I've had today: Consider $\displaystyle v = \frac{Gmt}{r^2}$ where $v$ is the velocity of a small particle affected by the gravitation of a larger object, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the larger object applying gravitation, $r$ is the distance between the two objects and $t$ is time. The problem is $r$, which is both a function of time and velocity. But velocity is a function of $r$. Can you see my dilemma? $$r = r_0-vt$$ where $r_0$ is the initial distance between the to objects (assume we know this value) The aim here is to plot velocity as a function of time, but I can't even get a concrete function for velocity. Is there any mathematical techniques that can be applied to get velocity solely in terms of $t$? I've been staring at it for ages but I can't figure it out for the life of me. Am I going about this the wrong way, is it even possible to what am asking? If it's not possible, perhaps someone can explain to me exactly what's going on and just help me understand. Thank you, it's much appreciated. (p.s I've not yet been to university so my mathematical background isn't strong.

2029575,What are the odds of winning this bingo game?,"I'll explain the game real quick, it's called Pick 8. You get a sheet of paper, containing 3 rows of 8 boxes. You fill out each row with numbers 1-75, in any order, with no duplicates. The bingo caller then starts calling bingo numbers. If you get a row filled during the first 20 numbers called, you win the jackpot, which is usually around \$7000. The first person to win after 20 balls are called wins \$500. I'm interested in the jackpot. Mainly, how many sheets would I need to buy and fill out with an 8-number combination to ensure ~70% probability of winning in the first 20 numbers called? Each sheets costs \$3, so it's \$1 a row. I started by calculating how many 8-number combinations there are in a pool of 75 (where order doesn't matter). Apparently that's called a binomial coefficient, and it comes out to ~16.8 billion combinations. But I don't where to take it from there - how do I take into account the fact that I get 20 chances to get an 8-number combination correct? If I can figure out that, then I can multiply those odds by 3, and then multiply it even further to cover 70% of the possible combos, to see how many sheets I'd need to buy.",['probability']

The function $f$ has a simple pole on $C$ , so I changed the contour a bit to avoid this singularity, the figure below shows a sketch I did this inspired by this other question. Now I split my new integration contour into two: $C_1 = \{z: z = e^{i\theta},\; \pi/2 + \epsilon <\theta<5\pi/2 + \epsilon \}$ This is the result I get $$ 
 I_1 = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{C_1}{\rm d}z\;f(z) = i\pi e^i \tag{1}
 $$ $C_2 = \{z: z = i + \epsilon e^{i\theta},\; -\pi <\theta<0 \}$ $$ 
 I_2 = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{C_2}{\rm d}z\;f(z) = 2\pi(i - 1) -2\pi i e^i \tag{2}

What I have got: The construction of an orthonormal frame $(\overline E_i)$ near p with $\overline E_i (p) = e_i$. Follows from Gram-Schmidt process with no problem. Defining $E_i= \sum_j \alpha_i^j\overline E_i$ the frame is still orthonormal, that follows from a direct calculation and the fact that  $(\alpha_i^j(x))_{ij} \in SO(n)$ and $\overline E_i (p) = e_i$ because $\alpha_i^j(p)= \delta_i^j$. Since $h(E_i,E_j)= \delta_i^j$ then: $h(\nabla_X E_i, E_j) + h(E_i,\nabla_X E_j) = 0 $. So all I have to see is that: $h(\nabla_X E_i, E_j) = h(E_i,\nabla_X E_j) $ Writing the above equation with the koszul formula and doing the calculations, Using the antisymmetry of Lie bracket and the fact that the inner product is commutative: $h(\nabla_X E_i, E_j) - h(E_i,\nabla_X E_j) = -h([E_i,E_j],X) $ So all at have to see is that in p: $[E_i,E_j](p) = 0$ That the Lie bracket its 0 at p for the basis constructed in this way!

Prove that $C([0,1])$ is not finite dimensional. There is a theorem which states that a normed vector space is finite dimensional if and only if its closed unit ball $\{v\in V: \lVert v \rVert =1   \}$ is compact. In our case, $S=\{f\in C([0,1]): \lVert f \rVert_\infty =1   \}$. We know that a subset of a vector space is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Clearly, $S$ is bounded. So all is needed to be proved here is that $S$ cannot be closed to establish that $(C([0,1]),\lVert \cdot \rVert_\infty)$ is not finite dimensional. One of the approaches that I've tried is this: If $f_0$ is a limit point of $S$ then $\exists \{f_n\}\subset S$ such that $\{f_n\}$ converges to $f$. In this case, one would have to prove that somehow $\lVert f_0 \rVert_\infty \ne 1$.

$$n{n+1 \over 2n+1} \le \left( 1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt[3]{3} + \dots \sqrt[n]{n} \right) \ln{2n+1 \over n}$$

$$

$$
$$

Alternative ways to prove integral $(1)$ are also welcomed because they might show how to obtain generalizations. Integrals with similar looking integrands has been considered before, however no context was given explaining where did they arize and no closed form solution was given: integrate $\int \frac{1}{e^{x}+e^{ax}+e^{a^{2}x}} \, dx$ Integrating a Complex Exponential Function I know only one proof of $(1)$ which is as follows. By contour integration applied to the function $$\frac{1}{z\prod_{k=1}^\infty\left(1+\frac{z^3}{k^3}\right)}$$ one can show that 
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\left|\Gamma(1-\varepsilon n)\right|^2=-\frac13\tag{*}
$$
where $\varepsilon=e^{2\pi i/3}$.
Then using the integral 3.985.1 from Gradsteyn and Ryzhik $$ \int_0^\infty \frac{\cos{ax} \space dx}{ch^\gamma \beta x} = \frac{2^{\gamma - 2}}{\beta\Gamma(\gamma)} \Gamma\left( \frac{\gamma}{2} + \frac{ai}{2\beta} \right) \Gamma\left( \frac{\gamma}{2} - \frac{ai}{2\beta} \right) $$ one can write this series as an integral
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\left|\Gamma(1-\varepsilon n)\right|^2=-1+\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{\left(\cosh x+\frac{1}{2}e^{ix\sqrt{3}}\right)^2}.\qquad \qquad \Box
$$ This approach also allows to prove that
$$
\int_\limits{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\text{sech}x~e^{\frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2}x}dx}{\sqrt{e^x+e^{-x}+e^{i\sqrt{3}x}}}=\frac{\pi}{3},\tag{2}
$$
$$
\int_\limits{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{e^{i \sqrt{3} x} \cosh x}{\left(e^x+e^{-x}+e^{i \sqrt{3} x}\right)^2}dx=\frac{1}{12}.\tag{3}
$$
It is interesting that $(3)$ is obtained from the same series evaluation (*) as $(1)$. Note also the equivalent forms
$$
\int_0^\infty\frac{t^{\alpha-1}dt}{(1+t+t^{\,\alpha})^2}=\frac{1}{3\alpha}, \quad \alpha=\frac{1+i\sqrt3}{2}\tag{3a}
$$
$$
\int_0^\infty\frac{t^{\alpha}dt}{(1+t+t^{\,\alpha})^2}=\frac{\alpha}{3}\tag{3b}
$$ However, I couldn't apply this technique to find any other integrals of similar kind calculable in closed form that have simple form as $(1),(2),(3)$. It is not also clear whether there is a direct computation without summation of any series. Given the simplicity of the closed forms above this might be possible. Note that it one can write $(1)$ and $(2)$ in terms of real integrands completely avoiding complex numbers, but the current form is more compact. Q1: Are there any other ways to prove $(1),(2),(3)$? Q2: What are possible generalizations of these integrals?","['alternative-proof', 'closed-form', 'integration', 'definite-integrals', 'contour-integration']"

In other words is this number something that can be deduced soley from the action of $G$ on $X$? I know that it does not depend on $K$ when you consider the natural action of $S_n$ on $\{1,\dots,n\}$. This is not too difficult to see as the image is the set of matrices whose rows and columns all sum to the same constant.

Getting the probability distribution for X1 is interesting but not vital. Context I'm trying to find the best strategy for a board game I play with my friends. In it, you can draw n cards (you decide how many beforehand) and pay an amount for each card you want to draw. There are r different types of card, all with equal chances of appearing. After this, getting only one card of a type is penalized, while getting a group of 2 or more of the same kind is rewarded. Obviously, drawing dozens of cards assures you will not get many ""singletons"", but the cost becomes prohibitive. Knowing how many singletons vs groups i can expect if i draw n cards can help me optimize my plays (yes, I'm THAT guy that can't stop optimizing irrelevant things). The model Each card type is a ""bin"", and each card drawn is an element. There are r bins. N elements are distributed in the bins. Each element has to go into one and only one bin (once you show the card, you know what type it is). Each bin has the same chances of being selected. There is no limit on how many elements a bin can hold. Elements are indistinguishable, because the only thing that matter is how many of each type you get, regardless of the order. What I want to do I'm trying to plot (expected number of bins with 1 element), (expected number of bins with 2 or more elements) vs (number of elements distributed), with a 10% and 90% percentile lines if possible. The graph tools i know all require a explicit formula (a function of n) for the plot lines and allow no code. I know how to make a simulation of the card draw, but I prefer to use it as a validation for the analytical formula.
I'm very familiar with excel/google sheets and the rest of my related analisys are on that format. I can learn another tool if necesary, but the distribution has to be expressed as a function of n and r. What I've tried Reading the wikipedia article about probablility distributions, i find that this one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution describes exactly the experiment I'm doing, but the information it provides is not the one I look for. This is already beyond the statistics I've learned in college and I'm stuck. I also tried modelling the problem as a system of differential equations of n variables X0, X1...Xn where Xi=""number of bins with exactly i elements in it"". When distributing an element, the probability that it falls in a bin with i elements is proportional to Xi, and the effect is that Xi decreases in 1 and X(i+1) increases in 1. It looks similar to this: dX0/dn=-kÂ·X0 dX1/dn= + kÂ·X0 - k Â· X1 dX2/dn= + kÂ·X1 - k Â· X2 ... dXn/dn= + k Â· X(n-1) What failed in my approaches About the multinomial, I have to provide the specific combinations of number of elements in each bin to get the chances of the combination, but I want to ""group"" all the combinations that have say, 3 bins with 1 element, and combine the chances of all those combinations. This becomes unwieldly when n increases. About the differenctial equations,  I'm turning a discrete variable (number of elements) into continuous. It has undesirable effects, for example distributing only 1 element, and finding that there are 0,000001 bins with 20 elements already. Also, I only know the values at n=0 (all the bins are empty, so X0=r, and 0 for the rest) so I struggle giving a value to k. My questions â¢ Is any probability distribution that models my problem and provides the information I look for better than the multinomial? â¢ If not, is it possible to combine explicitly all the combinations of / into ? â¢ What other data point (apart from n=0) can be used to estimate k in the case of the differential equations. Observations â¢ n is at least 1 but has no upper bound â¢ The cost of drawing a card is constant so it doesn't matter â¢ The amount of physical cards is the game is high enough that drawing a card without replacing it doesn't change the probabilities of getting each card type in any meaningful way, so chances of getting each type remain constant. â¢ First post here!  I really wanted to make a structured question, but maybe I was too verbose, sorry about that.

So the definition of sufficient is that the conditional distribution $X\mid T=t$ is independent of $\theta$. One can show that sufficency is equivalent to $$f_{\theta}(x) = g(T(x), \theta) h(x).$$ Do I have to use this criterion or is it possible to show it directly? How could I start here?

P(X=x) & = \frac{ \binom A x \binom{N-A}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}} =\frac{A! (N-A)! (N-n)!}{(A-x)!(N-A-n+x)!N!} \cdot \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \\[10pt]

I have tried changing $4\sin(A)\sin(B)\sin(C)$ to  $$4\sin(B+C)\sin(A+C)\sin(A+B)$$ by making substitutions by reorganizing $A+B+C=\pi$. I then did the same thing to the other side to get $$-2(\sin(B+C)\cos(B+C)+\sin(A+C)\cos(A+C)+\sin(A+B)\cos(A+B))$$ and then tried using the compound angle formula to see if i got an equality. However the whole thing became one huge mess and I didn't seem to get any closer to the solution. I am pretty sure there is some simpler way of proving the equality, but I can't seem to figure it out. Maybe there is a geometric interpretation or maybe it can be done using just algebra and trig.

2031068,"Why continuous function can be considered as ""topological homomorphism""?","In Munkres's book on topology, the notion of homeomorphism is stated to be analogous to the notion of isomorphism in context of modern algebra. I was wondering what will be the analogous concept of homomorphism in context of topology. One of my professors said that it is the continuous functions but I don't understand (although he tried) the reason behind this assertion. For example in case of group homomorphism we see that a group homomorphism $\varphi:(G,\circ)\to (H,\bullet)$ is a map such that $\varphi(x\circ y)=\varphi(x)\bullet\varphi(y)$ for all $x,y\in G$. If we try to define the notion of, say, ""topological homomorphism"", in an analogous manner we could define it in the following, A topological homorphism $\tau:(X,\mathscr{T}_X)\to (Y,\mathscr{T}_Y)$ is a map such that it preserves the ""topological structures"". But since here I don't know the precise notion of topological structures, I can't relate the notion of topological homomorphism as stated above to the notion of continuous functions. To me it seems that the notion of injective open map could serve as a notion of ""topological homomorphism"". Because actually the problem (at least for me) is that while we are discussing groups we can say that the homomorphism is ""structure preserving"" in the sense that it is ""binary operation preserving"". But here in case of topological spaces what can play the role of ""binary operation""? If we say that the topological homomorphism should preserve the arbitrary union and finite intersection of open sets then the most natural way to think about it is probably the notion of an injective open map .

2031177,Goldbach Conjecture and the Busy Beaver function?,"Background: Math undergrad, but complete layman in computer science I recently asked this question on CS stackexchange. I hope I am interpreting the answers correctly: Suppose we make a program to check that every even number greater than $2$ is the sum of two primes and run. All we have to do is run it for a certain, finite ammount of time; if a counterexample is found in that time, the conjecture is false. If no counterexample is found in that time, then the program will never halt so therefore the conjecture is true. Therefore there is an upper bound for the first possible counterexample. My question is, how is this upper bound encoded mathematically in the Goldbach conjecture? Does this mean that any math problem can be answered by brute force in a finite ammount of time? I am still in shock; all my life I've been told that if you have a statement about infinitely many numbers, you will never be able to conclude that it is true by just plugging in more and more numbers; but apparently this is possible. To me it's unbelivable that the upper bound for the smallest counterexample depends on our ability to encode the problem in a program.

There are a lot of different types of convergence which are defined now, for example we have: Weak convergence ($X_n\overset{w}{\rightarrow} X$) Convergence in probability ($X_n\overset{p}{\rightarrow} X$) Almost sure convergence ($X_n\overset{a.s.}{\rightarrow} X$) Convergence in $L^p$ ($X_n\overset{L_p}{\rightarrow} X$) Sure convergence ($X_n\overset{s}{\rightarrow} X$) Convergence in mean ($X_n\overset{m}{\rightarrow} X$) and for all of these we can look at the space of random variables with this type of convergence $(\mathcal{R}(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P}),\overset{*}{\rightarrow})$ where we sometimes make restrictions like in $L_p$ convergence we only take variables with a finite $p$'th moment.

2031236,What fraction of the fund should one bet?,"Say we have a gambler who makes money through sports betting. My aim is to develop a model to help our gambler maximise his winnings and minimize losses. In my model, rather than betting a fixed amount of money, the gambler bets a certain fraction $0 < r < 1$ of his current betting fund. He continues betting that fraction as his betting fund increases or decreases until he cashes out after a certain number of sessions $n$. The gambler's initial fund shall be $F_0$. His fund after $i$ sessions shall be $F_i$. His probability of making a correct prediction shall be $0 < p < 1$. If our gambler had a $p$ of $0$ or $1$, then the entire model would be useless. The average odds with which our gambler deals with is $a > 1$. The gambler's minimum desired profit upon cash out is $T$. $$T \le F_n - F_0 \tag{1}$$ If we expressed everything as a multiple of $F_0$, $(1)$ can be rewritten as: $$T \le F_n - 1 \tag{1.1}$$ It follows that the following are known: $T$, $a$, $F_0$, $p$. Should our gambler lose a particular session say $i+1$, $$F_{i+1} = (1-r)F_i \tag{2.1}$$ Should he win that particular session $$F_{i+1} = F_i(1-r + ra) \tag{2.2}$$ Given that the gambler plays $n$ sessioms before cashing out. His expected number of wins = $p*n$        $(3.1)$ His expected number of losses = $(1-p)*n$         $(3.2)$ Now there are many different ways to distribute the gambler's losses and wins{$n \Bbb P pn$} and while calculating all scenarios and finding average $F_n$ may be ideal, it is computationally very expensive. So I decided to  model the problem assuming the losses take place in the worst way possible( back to back at the very beginning of the match). The gambler's revenue after $n$ matches is given by the formula: $F_n = (1-r)^{(1-p)n}\{(1-r)+ra\}^{pn}$             $(4)$ Now we know that our gambler wants to make a minimum profit of $T$ so we transform $(4)$ into an inequality using $(1.1)$ We get: $(1-r)^{(1-p)n}\{(1-r)+ra\}^{pn}$ $ \ge T + 1$         $(4.1)$ Taking the Natural logarithm of both sides, I get: $ln(1-r)*(1-p)(n) + ln(1-r + ra)*pn \ge ln(T+1)$           $(4.2)$ $n\{ln(1-r)(1-p) + ln(r(a-1)+1)(p) \} \ge ln(T+1)$    $(4.3)$ Giving the constraints on the variables and constants, I want to determine the minimum value of $n$ and maximum value of $r$ that satisfies $(4.1) / (4.3)$ (whichever is easier to solve) for any given $T$, $a$, $p$. MAJOR EDIT Thanks to @Rodrigo de Azevedo, I discovered Kelly's Criterion. I was sold on it, and decided to implement it into my gambling method. For the purposes of my method Kelly's criterion is given by: $r_i = p - $ ${1 - p}\over{a_i - 1}$  $(5)$ Where: $r_i$ is the ratio at session $i$ $a_i$ is the odds at session $i$ Now $r: 0 \lt r \lt 1$  $(5.1)$ Applying $(5.1)$ to $(5)$ we get: ${p(a - 1) - (1 -p)}\over{a - 1}$ $ \gt \frac{0}{1}$ Cross multiply. $p(a-1) - (1 - p) \gt 0(a-1)$ $pa - p - 1 + p \gt 0$ $pa - 1 > 0$ $pa > 1$ $p > 1/a$  $(5.2)$ Now that that's out of the way, we still have the problem of determining minimum $n$ such that we make a profit $ \ge T$. In order to do this, we'll assume a ""mean"" value for $a$ then find the minimum value for $n$ that satisfies $(4.1)$ Due to the fact, that you do not know the odds for the matches in advance, your mean odds at $i$ say $a_{\mu i}$ may not be the mean odds at $n$ $a_{\mu n}$. In order to protect against this(and because I'm not a very big risk taker), I'll assume a value for $a_{\mu}$, that is less than $a_{\mu}$ called $a_{det}$. $a_{det} = a_{\mu} - k\sigma$ Where $a_{\mu}$ is the Geometric Mean as opposed to the arithmetic mean of the odds and $\sigma$ is associated S.D Using Chebyshev's Inequality, at least $k^{2} - 1 \over k^2$ of the distribution of the odds lie above $a_{det}$. Picking a $k$ of $2.5$ $2.5^{2}-1\over 2.5^{2}$ $0.84$ So our $a_{det}$ is lower than at least $84$% of the distribution of the odds. This is safe enough for me. $a_{det} = a_{\mu} - 2.5\sigma$ Using $a_{det}$, we'll calculate the minimum $n$ that satisfies $(4.1)$ Subbing $5$ and $a_{det}$ into $(4.1)$ we get: $\left(1-\left(p - \frac{1-p}{a_{det}-1}  \right) \right)^{n - np} \cdot \left(\left(p - \frac{1-p}{a_{det}-1}  \right)\cdot(a_{det} - 1)\right)^{np}$  $ \ge T + 1$   $(6.0)$ This can be simplified further to:
$\left({a_{det}-1-(pa_{det}-1)}\over{a_{det}-1}\right)^{n(1-p)}\cdot\left(pa_{det}-1+1\right)^{np}$ $\left({a_{det}-pa_{det}}\over{a_{det}-1}\right)^{n(1-p)}\cdot\left(pa_{det}\right)^{np}$ $\left(\left(\frac{a_{det}*(1-p)}{a_{det}-1}\right)^{n(1-p)}\cdot\left(pa_{det}\right)^{np}\right)$ $(6.1)$ P.S due to my particularly low $a_{det}$ we'll likely make much more profit than $T$, but that's loads better than choosing a higher $a_{det}$ and making less.","['operations-research', 'probability', 'mathematical-modeling', 'gambling']"

The analogous problem where you want to put the cannonballs in a square instead of a cube is know to have only one nontrivial solution: $$\sum_{n=1}^{24}n^2=70^2$$ It can be seen that $n,n+1,2n+1$ are pairwise coprime by using Euclid's algorithm. Consider the six cases of the rest $n \pmod 6$: $n=6y$ $y(6y+1)(12y+1)=x^3$ Since the product of 3 coprime integers is a cube each is a cube too. Let 
$y=a^3$, $6y+1=b^3$, $12y+1=c^3$. A solution is the equivalent to a solution to the system $$b^3-6a^3 = c^3 - 12 a^3 = 1$$ $n=6y+1$ Applying the same argument and substitution: $$2b^3-a^3=3c^3-2a^3=1$$ $n=6y+2$ $$c^3-4a^3=6b^3-c^3=1$$ $n=6y+3$ $$c^3-6a^3=4b^3-c^3=1$$ $n=6y+4$ $$b^3-2a^3=2b^3-3c^3=1$$ $n=6y+5$ $$c^3-2a^3=12b^3-c^3=1$$ So if it is proven that none of these systems of ""cubic Pell equations"" has a nontrivial solution, the theorem is proven.

2031334,Please verify my proof of: There is no integer $\geq2$ sum of squares of whose digits equal the integer itself.,"While going to sleep, I just started thinking about numbers, their squares, cubes and after thinking for about $20$ minutes I got that: There is no integer (having any numbers of digits) except $0$ and $1$, sum of squares of whose digits is equal to number itself. Isn't it interesting ?? Now I came out blanket and started writing everything on paper (Or started finding a proof of what I have got). MY WORK Suppose there exist an integer $a_0a_1a_2.......a_{n-1}$  having n digits. Firstly, we can easily exclude negative integers from the race as the number will be negative and sum of squares will be positive (we can never equate negative and positive). Now comes the turn of non negative integers. As we have assume that there exist an integer which satisfy our condition so, it should yield us: $$10^{n-1}a_0+10^{n-2}a_1+.........10a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}={a_0}^2+{a_1}^2+.......{a_{n-2}}^2+{a_{n-1}}^2$$
Which on further solving becomes,
$$a_0(10^{n-1}-a_0)+a_1(10^{n-2}-a_1)+.........+a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})+a_{n-1}(1-a_{n-1})=0$$
$$a_0(10^{n-1}-a_0)+a_1(10^{n-2}-a_1)+.........+a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})=a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)$$ Now, the hardest part for me comes: The terms of left are all positive and they increase as we keep on going towards left. We can only compare the terms $$a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)$$ and $$a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})$$ because the shortest of other terms is too far from comparison. Now if we make some comparison, we will have $$a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)=a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})$$ Now let's form a table for the function on RHS: $$\begin{array}{c|c}
a_{n-2}&            a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})\\\hline

9&                         9

a_{n-1}&                       a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)\\\hline

9&                                 72

Now we have all possible values of  $a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)$ and  $a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})$ and A quick look at tables yield that the only common value $a_{n-1}(a_{n-1}-1)$ and  $a_{n-2}(10-a_{n-2})$ have is $0$. So the condition is followed when ($a_{n-1}$ ,$a_{n-2}$ )=($0,0$) and ($1,0$). Or $1$ and $0$ are the only numbers which follow the condition.{ There is no integer (having any numbers of digits) except $0$ and $1$, sum of squares of whose digits is equal to number itself is proved }.

But what happens for other choices of $a$ and how can one prove it converges or diverges in those scenarios? This is Terence Tao's comment on it (which I didn't fully understand) - https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/the-strong-law-of-large-numbers/ Assuming the random variables have bounded second moment, the limit will be almost surely zero for a > 1/2, converge (in a distributional sense) to a normal distribution for a=1/2, and diverge to infinity almost surely for a < 1/2, all thanks to the (strong) law of large numbers. For heavy-tailed random variables with infinite second moment, the situation is going to be more complicated, but can be worked out for any specific distribution by a variety of tools (e.g. Fourier analysis)""","['probability-limit-theorems', 'law-of-large-numbers', 'probability-theory', 'central-limit-theorem']"
2031368,Sigma additivity of events implies events being disjoint,"Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $(A_n)_n$ a sequence in $\mathcal{A}$. If $\mathbb{P}(\bigcup_n A_n) = \sum\limits_{n} \mathbb{P}(A_n)$, then $\mathbb{P}(A_i \cap A_j) = 0$ for all $i,j \in \mathbb{N}, i \not= j$. I have to prove that the $\sigma-$additivity of the probability measure implies that the events are pairwise disjoint. It is clear that I could construct a disjoint sequence $B_n := A_n \setminus \bigcup_{k = 1}^{n-1} A_k$ that would satisfy the condition but that doesn't really help with this excercise.","['probability-theory', 'probability', 'measure-theory']"
2031372,Other integrals for the tribonacci constant?,"The post, Is there an integral for the golden ratio? gives numerous beautiful integrals for $\phi$. Some were just specializations of trigonometric evaluations such as,
$$F(k)=\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\pi/k-1}}{1+x^{2\pi}}dx =\frac{1}{2}\csc\Big(\frac{\pi}{2k}\Big)=\phi,\quad\text{at}\;k=5$$
However, integrals for phi's cousin the tribonacci constant $T$ seem to be harder to find. Phi appears in the pentagon, dodecahedron, etc, but $T$ also has a geometric context, the snub cube, $\hskip2.8in$ One integral I know for $T$ is,
$$\beta\times \Bigl(\frac{T+1}{T}\Bigr)^2=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1-t^2)(1-k^2t^2)}}dt = 1.570983\dots$$
where,
$$\beta=\frac{\Gamma\bigl(\tfrac{1}{11}\bigr)\, \Gamma\bigl(\tfrac{3}{11}\bigr)\, \Gamma\bigl(\tfrac{4}{11}\bigr)\, \Gamma\bigl(\tfrac{5}{11}\bigr)\, \Gamma\bigl(\tfrac{9}{11}\bigr)}{11^{1/4}(4\pi)^2}$$
$$k = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2-\sqrt{\frac{2T+15}{2T+1}}}$$
though it is a bit unsatisfying as $T$ appears in the integrand. Q: Are there other nice integrals for the tribonacci constant $T$?","['constants', 'definite-integrals', 'sequences-and-series', 'calculus']"
2031389,Extended Upper Half plane and Modular Curves,"Perhaps an introductory question, but, recently a came across the notion of Modular Curve and I read about its compactification. Now, every Modular Curve is by definition a quotient of the form $\mathbb{H}/ \Gamma$, for $\mathbb{H}$ the upper-half plane and $\Gamma$ a suitable (congruence) subgroup of $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z}$). Since this becomes a Hausdorff space thourgh the quotient topology given by the natural projection $\pi: \mathbb{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{H} / \Gamma$, we can ask about its compactification. We can define that compactification to be the quotient of the topological space $\mathbb{H}^{*}= \mathbb{H} \cup \mathbb{P}^{1} (\mathbb{Q})$ called the extended upper half plane, by $\Gamma$, with the ""natural"" action of the latter on $\mathbb{P}^{1} (\mathbb{Q})$ (induced by the action on each coordinate of  points of $\mathbb{Q}^{2}$ via MÃ¶bius Transformation). Now, my question is, why do we choose $\mathbb{Q}$ and not another field instead, such as $\mathbb{R}$ for instance?","['riemann-surfaces', 'moduli-space', 'algebraic-geometry', 'number-theory', 'modular-forms']"
