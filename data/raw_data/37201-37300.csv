More precisely, let $\left(\Omega_i,\mathcal{A}_i\right)$ be measurable spaces, $i\in\left\{1,2,3\right\}$. Let $f:\Omega_1\times\Omega_2\rightarrow\Omega_3$. For every $\omega_1\in\Omega_1$, $\omega_2\in\Omega_2$ define $$

$$ It is known (e.g. Schilling, Theorem 13.10 iii) that if $f$ is $\mathcal{A}_1\otimes\mathcal{A}_2/\mathcal{A}_3$-measurable, then $f_1^{\left(\omega_1\right)}$ is $\mathcal{A}_2/\mathcal{A}_3$-measurable for every $\omega_1\in\Omega_1$ and $f_2^{\left(\omega_2\right)}$ is $\mathcal{A}_1/\mathcal{A}_3$-measurable for every $\omega_2\in\Omega_2$. But does the converse hold as well? In comparison, both directions hold in the following, related result (Schilling, Theorem 13.10 ii): $f:\Omega_3\rightarrow\Omega_1\times\Omega_2$ is $\mathcal{A}_3/\mathcal{A}_1\otimes\mathcal{A}_2$-measurable iff $\pi_i\circ f$ is $\mathcal{A}_3/\mathcal{A}_i$-measurable ($i\in\left\{1,2\right\}$), with

359702,Reality check: $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^1}(1)$ and $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^1}(-1)$ are both Möbius strips?,"This question follows up this previous question , which has an accepted answer that I am having trouble believing. (Edit: the answer has now been fixed; thanks Georges!) I have been working on giving myself as concrete an understanding as possible of Serre's twisting sheaf $\mathcal{O}(1)$. My reference is Hartshorne, ch. 2, section 5. On their face, $\mathcal{O}(1),\mathcal{O}(-1)$ are invertible sheaves; I know it is standard to view them as algebraic line bundles. In the case $X=\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^1$ (viewed as a scheme), I am interested in visualizing these line bundles. Background: I am using the definition of algebraic vector bundle in Hartshorne ch. 2 sec. 5 exercise 18 on p. 128: a scheme $Y$, a morphism $f:Y\rightarrow X$, and an open cover $\{U_i\}$ of $X$ such that for each $U_i$, $f^{-1}(U_i)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}_{U_i}^n$ for some fixed $n$, and the isomorphisms $\psi_i:f^{-1}(U_i)\rightarrow\mathbb{A}_{U_i}^n$ satisfy the property that for every pair $i,j$ and for every open affine $V\subset U_i\cap U_j$, the appropriately restricted composition $\psi_j\circ\psi_i^{-1}$ is a linear automorphism of $\mathbb{A}_V^n$. To fix notation, let $Y,Z$ be algebraic line ($n=1$) bundles over $X=\mathbb{P}_\mathbb{R}^1$ such that the sheaves of sections $\mathscr{S}(Y/X)=\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ and $\mathscr{S}(Z/X)=\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$. After a fair amount of work, I have come to believe that we can obtain $Y,Z$ explicitly as follows: Let $U_1=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ and let $U_2=\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x',y']$, and identify $U_1\setminus \{x=0\} = \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{R}[x,x^{-1},y]$ with $U_2\setminus \{x'=0\} = \operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{R}[x',x'^{-1},y']$ via the scheme isomorphism induced from the ring isomorphism $x'\mapsto x^{-1}$, $y'\mapsto x^{-1}y$. Let $Y$ be the quotient of the disjoint union $U_1\cup U_2$ by this identification. Let the projection morphism $f:Y\rightarrow X$ be given by projection to the $x$-axis on $U_1$ and to the $x'$-axis on $U_2$. (In scheme-theoretic terms, the projection $U_1\rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$ is the morphism coming from the ring inclusion $\mathbb{R}[x]\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ and similarly for $U_2$.) We get $Z$ from the exact same construction except the isomorphism of $U_1\setminus\{x=0\}$ with $U_2\setminus \{x'=0\}$ is given by $x'\mapsto x^{-1}, y'\mapsto xy$ this time. My initial question: Do you agree with these constructions? As a plausibility check, we know $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ has a 2-dimensional vector space of global sections; these should correspond to sections of $Y/X$. I believe we get a basis of sections from the section $u$ that looks like $y=1$ on $U_1$ and $y'=x'$ on $U_2$ and the section $v$ that looks like $y'=1$ on $U_2$ and $y=x$ on $U_1$.  On the other hand, we know $\mathcal{O}_X(-1)$ has no nonzero global sections; this results from the fact that if a section looks like $y'=g(x')$ on $U_2$ (for $g$ some nonzero polynomial) it should look like $y = x^{-1}g(x^{-1})$ on $U_1$, but this can not possibly be regular at $x=0$. My main question: $Y, Z$ are not manifolds because they're schemes, but we can copy their construction with copies of the smooth manifold $\mathbb{R}^2$ instead of the scheme $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{R}^2$; it seems to me that this will give us real vector bundles over $S^1$ that are both diffeomorphic to the Möbius band (without boundary) and I'd like to know if you agree. To be explicit about the construction: Let $U_1=\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinate functions $x,y$. Let $U_2=\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinate functions $x',y'$.  Identify $U_1\setminus \{x=0\}$ with $U_2\setminus\{x'=0\}$ by $(x',y')\sim (x^{-1},x^{-1}y)$. The result is a smooth manifold because this identification gives smooth transition functions between the two coordinate patches. Restricting the construction to the $x$ and $x'$-axes gives $\mathbb{R}P^1\cong S^1$. Furthermore, for fixed $x$, the transition function $y'=x^{-1}y$ is linear in $y$, so it seems to me this implies the result is a line bundle over $S^1$. Let this be $\mathbf{Y}$. Create $\mathbf{Z}$ the same way except using $(x',y')\sim (x^{-1},xy)$. If these really are real line bundles, then they both have to be Möbius bands because that's the only nontrivial real line bundle over $S^1$. Is my thinking that these constructions yield real line bundles correct? Thanks in advance.","['vector-bundles', 'algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'coherent-sheaves', 'differential-topology']"

359742,Infinite self-convolution for a function,"I have a mathematical problem that leads me to a particular necessity. I need to calculate the convolution of a function for itself for a certain amount of times. So consider a generic function $f : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ and consider these hypothesis: $f$ is continuos in $\mathbb{R}$. $f$ is bound, so: $\exists A \in \mathbb{R} : |f(x)| \leq A, \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$. $f$ is integral-defined, so its area is a real number: $\exists \int_a^bf(x)\mathrm{d}x < \infty, \forall a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. Which implies that such a function at ifinite tends to zero. Probability mass functions: Such functions fit the constraints given before. So it might get easier for you to consider $f$ also like the pmf of some continuos r.v. Consider the convolution operation: $a(x) \ast b(x) = c(x)$. I name the variable always $x$. Consider now the following function: $$
F^{(n)}(x) = f(x) \ast f(x) \ast \dots \ast f(x), \text{for n times}
$$ I want to evaluate $F^{(\infty)}(x)$. And I would like to know whether there is a generic final result given a function like $f$. My trials I tried a little in Mathematica using the Gaussian distribution. What happens is that, as $n$ increases, the bell stretches and its peak always gets lower and lower until the function almost lies all over the x axis. It seems like $F^{(\infty)}(x)$ tends to $y=0$ function... As $n$ increases, the curves gets lower and lower.","['convolution', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

359921,Multiplying Laurent series,"I was solving the following problem from Bak & Newmans Complex Analysis (Chp. 9 # 12b): Find the Laurent series (in powers of z) for $$\frac{1}{z(z-1)(z-2)}$$ in the open annulus $1 < |z| < 2$ . I worked out the solution in a couple of ways. The first way used partial fraction decomposition then plugged in the Laurent series for $\frac{1}{z-1}$ and $\frac{1}{z-2}$ . After the first method seemed to work out, I thought I'd try to get the answer without using the partial fraction decomposition, but instead directly multiply (like a Cauchy product) the Laurent series for $\frac{1}{z-1}$ and $\frac{1}{z-2}$ . The second method gave the same answer as the first method, but I feel like I did some illegal sleight of hand. Taking the Cauchy product of power series involves evaluating a finite sum to get a coefficient. But performing an analogous operation for Laurent series can involve trying to sum an infinite series to find a coefficient. Are there any useful conditions that guarantee that this kind of formal product does what you expect it to - meaning that the sum/series that defines each coefficient converges and that the resulting Laurent series itself converges to the product of the values of the original two series? I was guessing that maybe you might be allowed to multiply two Laurent series on an annulus (if there is one) where they both converge. I thought this might work for the following reason: Let $f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}a_n(z-z_0)^n$ , $g(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_n(z-z_0)^n$ , and say they both converge on the same annulus around some point $z_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ . The product $f(z)g(z)$ is also analytic in the annulus, and so should have a Laurent series in that domain where the coefficient $c_k$ of $z^k$ is given by $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{\frac{f(z)g(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}}dz $$ Then you replace $g(z)$ inside the integral with its Laurent series in powers of $(z-z_0)$ : $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}b_n(z-z_0)^n dz } $$ Does uniform convergence allow us to interchange the integral and the sum? If so then it seems like each term is then a product $b_n a_{k-n}$ . EDIT: Here are more details, which I'm hoping are correct. $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}  \left( \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n }  \right) dz} $$ $$c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}  \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } dz} + \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{b_n(z-z_0)^n } dz} $$ Both integrands converge uniformly on the circle $C$ since the series do and $\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k+1}}$ is analytic on $C$ (and so bounded). So we can interchange the integral and the limit of the sequence of partial sums to get $$c_k = \sum_{n=-1}^{-\infty}{b_n \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_C{ \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_0)^{k - n + 1}} } dz}

359931,A torsor equivalent for a ring,"Reading John Baez's essay on torsors , I was quite intrigued with the last section which states: ""Finally, one more remark for people who want to go further. Near the beginning of this essay, I said ""as soon as we pick units of temperature, temperatures are elements of an R-torsor"". We need to pick units of temperature to know what it means to ""add 1"" to a temperature. So, where should we think of temperatures a living before we pick units? We should think of them as living on a line whose symmetries include not just translations but also dilations - in other words, the ""stretchings"" or ""squashings"" that result from a change of units. Picking an origin reduces the symmetry group to just dilations - and indeed, there's a distinguished choice of origin, namely absolutely zero. Picking units reduces the symmetry group to just translations, giving us an R-torsor - and indeed, there's a distinguished choice of units, namely Planck units. Picking both lets us think of temperatures as real numbers. This combination of translations and dilations arises because R is not just a group, but a ring. So, there's a more sophisticated concept than that of ""torsor"" allowing both translations and dilations whenever you start with a ring."" So, what is a generalization of a torsor for a ring?","['ring-theory', 'group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

359968,Convergence In $L^{1}$ in the Strong Law of Large Numbers,"I'm trying to prove that if $(X_n)_{n\geq 1}$ is uniformly integrable, then $X_n$  almost surely converging to $X$ implies $X_n$ converges to $X$ in $L^{1}$. How is this done? Generally speaking: Let $\{X_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of random variables, in $L^{p}$, $p\geq 1$, which converges to $X\in L^{0}$ in probability. Then, the following statements are equivalent: 1.) The sequence $\{|X_{n}|^{p}\}_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is uniformly integrable. 2.) $X_{n}\xrightarrow{L^{p}}X$. Proof: Since there exists a subsequence $\{X_{n_{k}}\}_{k\in\mathbb N}$ such that $X_{n_{k}}\xrightarrow{a.s}X$, Fatou's lemma implies that $$\mathbb E[|X|^{p}]=\mathbb E[\liminf_{k}|X_{n_{k}}|^{p}]\leq\liminf_{k}\mathbb E[|X_{n_{k}}|^{p}]\leq\sup_{X\in\chi}\mathbb E[|X|^p]<\infty,$$ where the last inequality follows from the fact that uniformly integrable families are bounded in $L^{1}$. Now that we know that $X\in L^{p}$, uniform integrability of $\{|X_{n}|^{p}\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ implies that the family $\{|X_{n}-X|^{p}\}_{n\in\mathbb N}$ is UI. Since $X_{n}\xrightarrow{\mathbb P}X$ if and only if $X_{n}-X\xrightarrow{\mathbb P}0$, we can assume without loss of generality that $X=0$ a.s., and, consequently, we need to show that $\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}]\rightarrow 0$. We fix an $\epsilon>0$, and start by the following estimate: $$\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}]=\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}1_{\{|X_{n}|^{p}\leq\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}}]+\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}1_{\{|X_{n}|^{p}>\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}}]$$ $$\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2}+\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}1_{\{|X_{n}|^{p}>\frac{\epsilon}{2}\}}]$$ By uniform integrability there exists $\rho>0$ such that $$\sup_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}1_{A}]<\frac{\epsilon}{2}$$ whenever $\mathbb P(A)\leq \rho$. Convergence in probability now implies that there exists $n_{0}\in\mathbb N$ such that for $n\geq n_{0}$, we have $$\mathbb P[|X_{n}|^{p}>\frac{\epsilon}{2}]\leq \rho.$$ It follows directly from the estimate that for $n\geq n_{0}$, we have $$\mathbb E[|X_{n}|^{p}]\leq \epsilon.$$","['probability-theory', 'uniform-integrability', 'random-variables', 'solution-verification']"

359986,About calculating a Green's function,"For a positive integer $d>=3$ and a real number $h_0$ I have the differential equation for a function $f$ of $x$, $$x^2 h^2 f'' + \frac{6-d}{2}xh^2 f' = \frac{d(d-2)}{2}h^2f$$ where $h = h_0 x^{1- \frac{d}{2}}$. 
(..and I believe that this explicit relationship between $h$ and $x$ is not necessary to solve the question..) Its full Green's function is claimed as $$G(x,x') = \theta(x-x')\frac{2x'^{d-3}}{h_0^2(3d-4)}[(x/x')^{-d/2} - (x/x')^{d-2}  ]$$ Let me state here as I would have solved this question. First let me shift to variable $a$ such that $x = e^a$ and drop the overall factor of $h$ (it can never be zero) and then I have the differential equation as, $[\frac{d^2}{da^2} + (2 - \frac{d}{2})\frac{d}{da} - \frac{d(d-2)}{2}]f(a) = 0$ So the Green's function equation that one wants to solve is, $[\frac{d^2}{da^2} + (2 - \frac{d}{2})\frac{d}{da} - \frac{d(d-2)}{2}]G(a-a') = \delta (a-a')$ Now we use Dirac delta function convention as $\delta (a-a') = \int \frac{dk}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{ik.(a-a')} $ and hence the Green's function and}( its Fourier transform is defined as $G(a-a') = \int \frac{dk}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \tilde{G}(k) e^{ik(a-a')}$ And substituting the above one is solving the algebraic equation, $[(ik)^2 + (2 - \frac{d}{2})ik - \frac{d(d-2)}{2}]\tilde{G}(k) =  1$ hence we have, $\tilde{G}(k) = \frac{-1}{(k-\frac{id}{2})(k-i(2-d))}$ Now with the above $\tilde{G}(k)$ we want to compute the contour integral, $ \int \frac{dk}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \tilde{G}(k) e^{ik(a-a')}$ Since $d\geq3$ one of the poles is on the positive imaginary axis, $\frac{id}{2}$ and one is on the negative imaginary axis, $i(2-d)$. For $a>a'$ I need to close the contour in the upper half plane for convergence and also I need both the poles to contribute. Hence I choose to close contour as the usual semi-circle on the UHP with the flat side on the real axis but while going near the origin I take a detour around the origin to go around the $i(2-d)$ pole in the LHP. Then I take the limit of this neck width to pinch to zero. Then doing the usual $\sqrt{2\pi i}Residue$ analysis I get, (after changing back to ""x"") $G(x,x') = \frac{-2\sqrt{2\pi}}{3d-4}[(x/x')^{-d/2} + (x/x')^{d-2}]$ But the above is not the right answer! - What can be changed in this Fourier transform based method to get the right answer?

359989,Biased random walk away from cliff,"A drunken probabilist stands $n$ steps from a cliff's edge. He takes random steps, either towards or away from the cliff, each step independent of the past. At any point, the probability of taking a step away is $2/3$, or a step toward, $1/3$. What are his chances of eventually falling off the cliff? The textbook has no answer. This is how I did it: Let $p(i)$ represent the probability of death if you start $i$ steps from the cliff. I first start with the case where $i=1$. Clearly, $$p(1)=\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3}p(2)$$ and $p(2)=(p(1))^2$ so we have the equation $$2(p(1))^2 + 1 - 3(p(1))=0$$ which we can easily solve. Then to get the case where $i=n$ simply raise $p(1)$ to the $n^\text{th}$ power. Is this correct?

  rectangles with vertices at $z=\pm p,p+i,-p+i.$ I asked this similar question, and was recommended this link stackexchange , but the answer provided is confusing.

If $G$ is a non-cyclic finite $p$-group, which is union of $p+1$ proper subgroups $A_1,A_2,\dots, A_{p+1}$, then $A_i$'s are maximal and $\cap_{i=1}^{p+1} {A_i}$ has index $p^2$ in $G$.

The problem, I want to post is to understand its proof; the main obstacle in my understanding is a set theoretic statement; it may be simple, but I couldn't understand. The proof is as follows: Proof: Let $|G|=p^{n}$. Then $G=\cup_{i=1}^{p+1} A_i= A_{p+1}\cup (A_1 - A_{p+1})\cup (A_2-A_{p+1})\cup \cdots \cup (A_p-A_{p+1})$.

More specifically can we deduce $\lim_{n}a_{n,n}=a$? I think this is true but I am not sure. My attempt at a rigorous proof: Let $\epsilon>0$. Argument 1:
$$\exists N_{\epsilon}\in \mathbb{N}: i\ge N_{\epsilon}\implies \left|\lim_ja_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|\lim_ja_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon$$
This is the definition of the limit (I take $N$ as the maximum of the two $n_0$). Argument 2:
$$i\ge N_{\epsilon}\implies \lim_j\left|a_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\lim_j\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon$$
This is an application of the limit laws. Now fix $i\ge N$. Argument 3:
$$\exists M_{\epsilon,i}\in \mathbb{N}:j\ge M_{\epsilon,i}\implies \left|a_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon$$
This follows from the fact that if $\lim_n\left|b_n\right|<K$ then for large $K>0$, $\left|b_n\right|<K$. Argument 4: As $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrary, 
$$\lim_j\left|a_{i,j}-a\right|=0\text{ and }\lim_j\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|=0$$
This is the wrong argment in my opinion as I have $$(\forall \epsilon>0)(\exists N_{\epsilon}\in \mathbb{N}): \ i\ge N_{\epsilon}\implies (\exists M_{\epsilon,i}\in \mathbb{N})\ :j\ge M_{\epsilon,i}\implies \left|a_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon
$$
and from this I deduce
$$(\forall \epsilon>0)(\exists M\in \mathbb{N})\ :j\ge M\implies \left|a_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon
$$
for large $i$ meaning $$(\forall \epsilon>0)(\exists N,M\in \mathbb{N}): \ i\ge N_{\epsilon}\text{ and }j\ge M_{\epsilon,i}\implies \left|a_{i,j}-a\right|<\epsilon\text{ and }\left|a_{j,i}-a\right|<\epsilon
$$ I basicaly lose the dependence on $i$. This is the difference for example between continuity and uniform continuity right? So,
$$i\ge N\implies \lim_ja_{i,j}=\lim_ja_{j,i}=a$$

I understand Hensel's lemma, namely: Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and let $m$, $k$ be positive integers such that $m \leq k$. If $r$ is an integer such that $f(r) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^k}$ and $f'(r) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$ then there exists an integer $s$ such that $f(s) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^{k+m}}$ and $r \equiv s \pmod{p^{k}}$. But I don't see how this has anything to do with $\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Q_7}$? I know a $7$-adic number $\alpha$ is a $7$-adically Cauchy sequence $a_n$ of rational numbers.

In particular, Ramanujan's does the following comparison in step (8): $$\ln\Gamma(x) - 2\ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{2}) \le \ln(\lfloor{x}\rfloor!) - 2\ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{2}\rfloor!)$$ It occurs to me that this can be generalized to: $$\ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_1}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{1}{2}) - \ln\Gamma(\frac{x}{b_3} + \frac{1}{2})\le \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor!) - \ln(\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor!)$$ when: $$\frac{x}{b_1} = \frac{x}{b_2} + \frac{x}{b_3}$$ I would really appreciate it if my argument could be reviewed and someone could call out any mistakes either in the answer or in comments.  :-) Here's the argument for this generalization: Let: $$\{\frac{x}{b_i}\} = \frac{x}{b_i} - \lfloor\frac{x}{b_i}\rfloor$$ where: $$0 \le \{\frac{x}{b_i}\} < 1$$ Since: $$\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor = \{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + \{\frac{x}{b_3}\} + \lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor$$ We have: $$\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \le \{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + \{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ So that: $$-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge -\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + -\{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ $$2-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge 1-\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} + 1-\{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$$ $$1-\{\frac{x}{b_1}\} \ge 1-\{\frac{x}{b_2}\} - \frac{1}{2} + 1-\{\frac{x}{b_3} \} - \frac{1}{2}$$ $$\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_1} \ge (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_2} - \frac{1}{2}) + (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor + 1 - \frac{x}{b_3} - \frac{1}{2})$$ $$\lfloor\frac{x}{b_1}\rfloor + 1 \ge (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_2}\rfloor + 1) + (\lfloor\frac{x}{b_3}\rfloor + 1)$$ If $\Delta{t_1} \ge \Delta{t_2} + \Delta{t_3}$ and $x_1 + \Delta{t_1} \ge x_2 + \Delta{t_2} \ge x_3 + \Delta{t_3} > 0$, Using the logic in the answer here : $$\frac{\Gamma(x_1 + \Delta{t_1})}{\Gamma(x_1)} \ge \frac{\Gamma(x_2 + \Delta{t_2})}{\Gamma(x_2)}\frac{\Gamma(x_3 + \Delta{t_3})}{\Gamma(x_3)}$$ Let: $x_1 = \frac{x}{b_1}$,  $\Delta{t_1} = 1 - \{\frac{x}{b_1}\}$, $x_2 = \frac{x}{b_2}+\frac{1}{2}$,  $\Delta{t_2} = \frac{1}{2} - \{\frac{x}{b_2}\}$ $x_3 = \frac{x}{b_3}+\frac{1}{2}$,  $\Delta{t_3} = \frac{1}{2} - \{\frac{x}{b_3}\}$ where $\frac{x}{b_2} \ge \frac{x}{b_3}$ (Otherwise, switch the two values).

360490,Differentiation under the Integral sign for the Lebesgue integral,"I want to prove the following version of Liebniz's Rule: Let $f:[a,b]\times [c,d]\to \mathbb{R}$ be integrable with respect to the first variable, $\phi,\psi:[c,d]\to [a,b]$ be differentiable and let $F:[c,d]\to \mathbb{R}$,
\begin{equation}F(y)=\int_{\phi(y)}^{\psi (y)}f(x,y)\, dx\end{equation}
If $f$ is partially differentiable with respect to $y\in [c,d]$ and there exists an integrable functions $g:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ so that
\begin{equation}\forall x\in [a,b]\ \left|\partial_y f(x,y)\right|\le g(x)\end{equation}
then $F$ is differentiable in $[c,d]$ and it holds
\begin{equation}F'(y)=f(\psi(y),y)\psi'(y)-f(\phi(y),y)\phi'(y)+\int_{\phi(y)}^{\psi(y)}\partial_yf(x,y)\, dx\end{equation}
almost everywhere in $[c,d]$. Proof: By linearity it suffices to deal with constant $\phi(y)=a$. Now let $y_n\to y$ in $[c,d]$ with $y_n\neq y$. Then, \begin{equation}\frac{F(y_n)-F(y)}{y_n-y}=\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_n)}f(x,y_n)\, dx-\int_{a}^{\psi (y)}f(x,y)\, dx\right)=\\
\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_n)}f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)\, dx\right)+\frac1{y_n-y}
\int_{\psi(y)}^{\psi (y_n)}f(x,y)\, dx\end{equation} The limit of the second term is essentialy the derivative of $\int_a^{\phi(t)}f(x,y) dx$ with respect to $t$ at $y$. By Lebesgue's differentiation theorem,
\begin{equation}\lim_{y\to +\infty}\frac1{y_n-y}\int_{\psi(y)}^{\psi (y_n)}f(x,y)\, dx=f(\psi(y),y)\psi'(y)\end{equation}
almost everywhere. For the first term, consider the integrable function
\begin{equation}h_n(x)=\frac{f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)}{y_n-y}\end{equation}
By the Mean Value Theorem there exists some $\xi_{n,x}$ between $y_n$ and $y$ with
\begin{equation}h_n(x)=\frac{f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)}{y_n-y}=\partial_yf(x,\xi_{n,x})\end{equation}
By the Dominated Convergence Theorem, as $h_n(x)\to \partial_yf(x,y)$,
\begin{equation}\int_a^{\psi(y_m)}\partial_yf(x,t)\, dx=\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_m)}f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)\, dx\right)
\end{equation}
and so by the continuity of the integral,
\begin{equation}\lim_{m\to+\infty}\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_m)}f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)\, dx\right)=\int_a^{\psi(y)}\partial_yf(x,y)\, dx\end{equation}
and similarly,
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\to+\infty}\lim_{m\to+\infty}\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_m)}f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)\, dx\right)=\int_a^{\psi(y)}\partial_yf(x,y)\, dx\end{equation} As I asked here earlier today we can't deduce that
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac1{y_n-y}\left(\int_{a}^{\psi (y_n)}f(x,y_n)-f(x,y)\, dx\right)=\int_a^{\psi(y)}\partial_yf(x,y)\, dx\end{equation}

Did I make a mistake in the derivative?  Is there some trick to show that this function increases for $x \ge 214$? Yet, when I look at Wolfram Alpha at $214 \le x \le 1000$, the graph , the function is increasing. Does it continue to increase for $x > 1000$? One thought that occurs to me is that I can analyze the following function: $$h(k) = \frac{-2}{k+1} + \frac{1}{k+\frac{x}{5}+\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{k + \frac{x}{20} + \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{k+\frac{x}{4}} + \frac{1}{k+\frac{x}{12} + \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{k + \frac{x}{60} + \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{k+\frac{x}{10}}$$ I will see if I can prove that at a certain point, the sum is increasing.  If I make progress with this approach, I will post my thinking as an answer. Thanks very much, -Larry Edit: I added a link to the graph based on a comment. The function starts increasing before $x$ gets to $214$.","['gamma-function', 'logarithms', 'derivatives']"

360604,Graph Concavity Test,"I'm studying for my final, and I'm having a problem with one of the questions. Everything before hand has been going fine and is correct, but I'm not understanding this part of the concavity test. $$f(x) = \frac{2(x+1)}{3x^2}$$
$$f'(x) =-\frac{2(x+2)}{3x^3}$$
$$f''(x) = \frac{4(x+3)}{3x^4}$$ For the increasing and decreasing test I found that the critical point is -2:
$$2(x+2)=0$$
$$x = -2$$ (This part is probably done differently than most of you do this), here's the chart of the I/D 2(x+2), Before -2 you will get a negative number, and after -2 you will get a positive number. Therefore, f'(x), before -2 will give you a negative number, and after you will get a positive number, so f(x) before -2 will be decreasing and after it will be increasing. Where -2 is your local minimum. (By this I mean; 2(x+2), any number before -2 (ie. -10) it will give you a negative number.) As for the concavity test, I did the same thing basically; $$4(x + 3) = 0$$
$$x = -3$$ However, my textbook says that x = 0 is also a critical point, I don't understand where you get this from. If anyone can explain this I would appreciate it, also if there's a more simple way of doing these tests I would love to hear it, thanks.","['calculus', 'derivatives']"
