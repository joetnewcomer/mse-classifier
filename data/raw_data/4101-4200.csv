29816,"An Alternate Proof to a Theorem Involving ""e""","In a paper, it was claimed that $\lim_{x \to \infty} (1-\frac{f(x)}{x})^x \sim e^{-f(x)}$ when $\frac{(f(x))^2}{x}$ is $o(1)$. I proved the claim in the following way; however, I'm seeking a simpler proof. Define $g(x) = \frac{(1-f(x)/x)^x}{x}$ and $h(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{x}$. To prove the theorem, we must show that $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{g(x)}{h(f(x))} = 1$ when $\frac{(f(x))^2}{x}$ is $o(1)$. To this end, we use the binary expansion for $g(x)$, and Taylor series for $h(x)$: $\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(x-f(x))^x}{x^{x+1}} =
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^x - \binom{x}{1}x^{x-1}f(x) + \binom{x}{2}x^{x-2}(f(x))^2 - \cdots}{x^{x+1}}
= \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1-f(x)}{x}$ (The last identity follows from the fact that $\frac{(f(x))^2}{x}$ is $o(1)$; that is $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(f(x))^2}{x} = 0$.) Now, since $h(x) \sim \frac{1 - x + x^2/2 - \cdots}{x}$, we have $h(f(x)) \sim \frac{1 - f(x) + (f(x))^2/2 - \cdots}{x}$, and $\lim_{x \to \infty} h(f(x)) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1-f(x)}{x}$. (Again, the last identity follows from the fact that $\frac{(f(x))^2}{x}$ is $o(1)$.) Combining the two limits, we see that $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{g(x)}{h(f(x))} = 1$. As I said, this proof is long, and to me, it is not appealing. Does anyone know a better proof?","['asymptotics', 'calculus']"
29838,Confusion regarding Riesz's lemma,"Wikipedia (and my teacher) state Riesz's lemma as follows: Let $X$ be a normed linear space and $Y$  be a subspace in $X$. If there exists $0 < r < 1$ such that for every $x\in X$ with $||x|| =1$ , one has $d(x, Y) < r$, then $Y$ is dense in $X$. Wikipedia then goes on to say In other words, for every proper closed subspace Y, one can always find a vector x on the unit sphere of X such that d(x, Y) is less than and arbitrarily close to 1. This is in fact the way Riesz's lemma is stated in several other places (e.g. appendix B of the book A Taste of Topology by Volker Runde). Now, I don't see how these two statements are so quickly equivalent. The second one seems to be the contrapositive of the first one. But this would mean that ""non dense subspace"" is the same as ""proper closed subspace"". This doesn't seem to be true: I thought, for instance, of $C([0,1])$, the space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the supremum norm, and of the subspace of differentiable functions. It's a dense subspace which is not closed. What is (obviously) true is that proper closed subspaces are not dense. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that to say ""in other words"" is innacurate, as the second statement is stronger than the first one! Is my reasoning correct?",['functional-analysis']
29867,Derivatives of infimum,"Let $\zeta: \mathbb{R^m} \times \mathbb{R^n} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth function and define $\phi(x) = \inf_{y \in C} \zeta(x,y)$ where $C \subset \mathbb{R^n}$ is compact. Suppose that for every $x \in X \subset \mathbb{R^m}$ there is a unique $y(x) \in C$ such that $\phi(x) = \zeta(x,y(x))$. Now, according to a book a have, $$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_0) =  \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} (x_0, y(x_0)) \quad \forall x_0 \in X$$ (this is let as a exercise). The problem is: 1) this looks simple but I don't where to start to prove this, 2) even if I knew how to deal with the first part, I also need the second differential (the Hessian) of $\phi$ (given in term of $\zeta$, $y$ and their derivatives). I tried to do something like $$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_0) =  \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x} (x_0, y(x_0)) + \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial y} (x_0, y(x_0)) \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(x_0)$$ (this suggests that $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(x_0) = 0$) and find the derivative of $y$ by the implicit function theorem, but I can only get the  tautology $\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_0) =\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}(x_0)$, so I suspect this isn't the good way. Note: this question is related to this one ( Infimum is a continuous function, compact set ).","['optimization', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
29881,How do I interpret an integral where the lower limit of integration is missing?,"I'm reading An Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations by Agarwal and O'Regan.  On page 28, I have the expression $$y\left(x\right)=c\exp\left(-\int^x{p\left(t\right)\, dt} \right)$$ which is equation 5.4. My problem is the missing lower limit of integration.  I don't understand what the notation means.  The context of the equation is solving the homogenous equation $$y^\prime+p\left(x\right)y=0.$$ This leads to $$\frac{y^\prime}{y}+p\left(x\right)=0.$$ The text says that by integrating both sides, we get the expression that is puzzling me.  Any advice on how to interpret this notation would be appreciated.","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'real-analysis']"

29944,Difference between linear map and homomorphism,"I came across the following definition: Given a ring $A$, with a unit $1 \in A$, and $A$-modules $M$ and $N$, we denote by $Hom(M, N)$ or $Hom_A(M, N)$ the space of $A$-linear maps from $M$ to $N$. My question is: what exactly is the difference between homomorphism and a linear map? I can see that linearity is defined in terms of a vector space or module and homomorphism in terms of groups. But every linear map is a homomorphism and when treating a group as a one dimensional vector space over itself, every homo. is also a linear map. This makes me think they are kind of the same. Is it ok to think of it that way? Or am I confused? Because I feel confused. Thanks once again for your help!","['terminology', 'abstract-algebra']"
29947,"What are the rules for transformation (translation, dilation, etc.) of integral on n-dimensional sphere?","We know that in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have transformation rules such as: $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x-h) dx=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x) dx$ $\delta^n \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(\delta x) dx=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}f(x) dx$. The proof of such formulas can be easily found in a book about real analysis.
They reduce the problem into an integral of a characteristic function  of a measurable set and then use some properties of measure to prove it. My problem is: what are the similar rules for integral on n-dimensional sphere? For example, What is the relationship between $\int_{\partial B(0,r)}f(x) dS_r$ and $\int_{\partial B(0,1)}f(rx)dS_1$, where $S_r$ is the area element of $\partial B(0,r)$? If there are some, how to prove it? (In addition, how to define such an integral using abstract integration theory?) And why is $\int_{\partial B(0,r)}f(x) dS_r=\int_{\partial B(y,r)}f(x-y)dS_r$?
( This may be easy to imagine when the dimension is 1 or 2, but I want to know a proof starting from the definition of such a integral especially when the dimension is high.) Thanks.","['calculus', 'integration', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"
29950,Does repeated activity increase the probability of a specific event happening?,"I am hoping that this is not too basic a question for this site, but I am seeking to better understand a conversation I have had with my more mathematically inclined friend. The discussion was around the probability of an event occuring with repeated exposure to a specific activity. The example in the conversation was the risk of (for example) injury occuring compared between someone who was a frequent skydiver (perhaps weekly) and someone who skydives once or twice a year. For the point of this exercise we are ignoring all external factors (wind, experience, etc) and are assuming that the risk of any injury (i.e. not one that would preclude someone from continuing to skydive) is fixed for each event. That is, as with a coin toss, each individual event is unaffected by the other events. To my mind it makes more sense that the person who chooses to skydive regularly is accepting a higher risk over the course of the year then the person who skydives once a year. My friend contests that the risk of an event happening is equal for both people over the course of the year. He attempted to explain this to me, but could not in a way that I understood. To clarify, I don't believe the risk increases cumulatively (i.e. if there was a 1/10 chance of something happening in one dive then I understand that this does not mean that something will definitely happen if a person dives 10 times). I am quite curious about which answer is correct, probability was always one of those areas that I sometimes found to be non-intuitive. Any insight here would be appreciated Thanks!",['probability']

Looking at the q-factorial made me wonder if this function could take all real or even complex numbers in the same way that $\Gamma (z)$ works as an extension of $f(n) =n!$. Since, I need practice with both $\Gamma $ and q-analogs, would it be a good project to try to recreate $\Gamma (z)$ in this new setting or is the whole project lacking in sanity, mathematical soundness? Also, a minor question, why is there sometimes a coefficient in q-analog expansions as in this expression: $(a;q)_n = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1-aq^k)=(1-a)(1-aq)(1-aq^2)\cdots(1-aq^{n-1}).$ I'm a bit embarrassed not to know, but non of the lit.

29990,"Translations of Darboux's ""Leçons Sur La Théorie Générale Des Surfaces""","This might be slightly stretching the boundary of acceptable questions, but I think this is the best group to ask. I'm interested in the classic 1887 texts "" Leçons Sur La Théorie Générale Des Surfaces Et Les Applications Géométriques Du Calcul Infinitésimal "" by French mathematician Jean Gaston Darboux (and which can be read online in very high quality scans thanks to the University of California here ). They were very influential in their time in establishing the fledgling field of differential geometry, and introduced many of its fundamental tools (such as, not surprisingly, the Darboux frame). My question is, has this work ever been translated into English? I can find many editions of the original French version, but I have been unsuccessful in finding any of the four volumes in English. I've checked the usual suspects (Dover, etc.) and my University's catalogue, but nothing comes up for the straightforward translation of the title ( Lessons on the General Theory of Surfaces and the Geometric Applications of Infinitesmal Calculus ) or the author's name. Was it retitled, perhaps, in translation? Secondly, and on a very related note, does anybody know for certain the copyright status of the original work (not any particular subsequent editions)? If this was published in America, I would expect the copyright to expire 70 years after Darboux's death in 1917, but perhaps things work differently in France. The UC site I linked above lists  "" Possible copyright status : NOT_IN_COPYRIGHT"" but that doesn't sound very reassuring to me.

Then there exists a continuous complex function $g$ on $X$ with compact support such that $μ(x:f(x)≠g(x))<ϵ$.

30020,Inverse Operator Methods for Differential Equations,"We have learned in class how to use inverse operator methods to solve ODE's (i.e. with the symbolic $D$). E.g, If I were asked to find a particular solution, $y_p$ to $(D-1)(D-2)[y] = x^{2}e^{x}$, then I would use the formula $\frac{g(x)}{D-a} = e^{ax} \int e^{-ax} g(x) dx$, where $g(x) = x^2 e^x$. However, here's the difficulty I'm facing; all the ODE's that we have learned in class with operator methods have been dealing with constant coefficient ODEs, what happens when you have variable coefficients? E.g. the ODE $xy'' +(2x -1)y' - 2y = x^2$ factorises to $(xD-1)(D+2)[y] = x^2$, so a particular solution $y_p$ should be $y_p$ = $\frac{x^2}{(xD-1)(D+2)}$.

The following is the proof he gave us for ($s_n^2$). I believe after understanding his proof better, I can prove the original problem more easily. So please do not post the solution to the original question. Proof {the convergence of the sequence ($s_n$) implies the convergence of ($s_n^2$)} Since the lim ($s_n$)=s, we know ($s_n$) is bounded.

Working on $\varepsilon/(M+|s|)>0$, there exists $N\in R$ such that $|s_n-s| \le \varepsilon /(M+|s|)$ whenever $n>N$, therefore for all $n>N$,   $|s_n^2 - s^2| = |s_n - s|*|s_n + s| \le |s_n - s|(|s_n|+|s|) \le |s_n - s|*(M + |s|)< \varepsilon $ Which proves lim $(s_n^2)$ = $s^2$. The following is my proof for the current problem (that is in the title). Let me know if I did anything incorrect. Proof Since the lim ($s_n$)=s, we know ($s_n$) is bounded. That is there exists $M > 0$ such that $|s_n|\le M$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ Now, for every $\varepsilon >0$ since lim ($s_n$)=s, working on $\varepsilon /(3M^2)>0$, there exists $N\in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
$|s_n-s| < \varepsilon /3M^2$ whenever $n>\mathbb{N}$ Therefore, for all $n>\mathbb{N}$ $|s_n^3 - s^3|$ = $|s_n - s|$ $|s_n^2 + s_n*s + s^2| \le $ $|s_n - s|$ $(|s_n^2|+|s_n||s|+ |s^2|) \le $ $(|s_n|^2+|s_n||s|+ |s|^2) \le $ $|s_n - s|*(M^2 + M*M + M^2) \le $ $|s_n - s|*(3M^2)< \varepsilon $ Which proves lim $(s_n^3)$ = $s^3$","['convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'real-analysis']"

Bonus points if multiplication $G \times G \to G$ (using the product uniformity on $G \times G$) is uniformly continuous or inversion is continuous. As Harry Altman points out, there must be (as for any uniformizable space) a finest uniformity $\mathscr{U}$ on $G$ compatible with the topology. Since the uniformities on $G$ form a (complete) lattice there is also a coarsest uniformity $\mathscr{V}$ refining both $\mathscr{L}$ and $\mathscr{R}$.

30103,Total ramification $p = \epsilon \pi^n$ implies $F = K(\pi)$ and minimal polynomial of $\pi$ Eisenstein,"Before I state my question, let me give the set-up / ""what I know"". Let $F / K$ be an extension of number fields of degree $n$.  Let $v$ be a (discrete) valuation on $K$ and let

\mathfrak{O}_{v} = \{ \alpha \in K : v(\alpha) \geq 0  \}
$$ 
be the valuation ring of $v$.  Up to associates,  $\mathfrak{O}_{v}$ has a unique irreducible element $p$ and $v(p) = 1$. Let $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ be the extensions of $v$ to the field $F$, let 
$$
\mathfrak{O}_{v_i} = \{ \alpha \in F : v_i(\alpha) \geq 0  \}
$$ 
be the valuation ring of $v_i$ $(i = 1, \ldots, m)$, and let $\pi_i$ be the unique (up to associates) irreducible element of $\mathfrak{O}_{v_i}$ $(i = 1, \ldots, m)$.  Then the integral closure of $\mathfrak{O}_{v}$ in $F$ is
$$
\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v} = \cap_{i=1}^{m} \mathfrak{O}_{v_i},
$$
the elements $\pi_1, \ldots, p_m$ constitute all the nonassociate irreducibles in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$, and $p$ factors in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ as
$$
p = \epsilon \pi_{1}^{e_1} \cdots \pi_{m}^{e_m} 
$$
where $\epsilon$ is a unit of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$, and where $e_i$ is the ramification index of $v_i$ with respect to $v$ (i.e., $e_i$ is the positive integer such that $v(\alpha) = v_i(\alpha)/e_i$ for all $\alpha \in K^{\times}$, i.e., $e_i = v_i(p)$). The residue class field of $v$ is $\Sigma_{v} = \mathfrak{O}_v / m_v$, where 
$$
m_v = (p) = \{ \alpha \in K : v(\alpha) > 0  \}
$$ 
is the unique maximal ideal of $\mathfrak{O}_v$.  Similarly, the residue class field of $v_i$ is $\Sigma_{v_i} = \mathfrak{O}_{v_i} / m_{v_i}$, where 
$$
m_{v_i} = (\pi_i) = \{ \alpha \in F : v_i(\alpha) > 0  \}

is the unique maximal ideal of $\mathfrak{O}_{v_i}$.  The residual degree of $v_i$ over $v$ is $f_i =  [ \Sigma_{v_i} : \Sigma_{v} ]$ The following formula relating the ramification indices $e_i$, the residual degrees $f_i$, the number $m$ of extensions of $v$ to $F$, and the degree $n$ of $F / K$ holds:

$$
has degree $n$.  Of course, $k \leq n$. Alex Bartel has offered a solution below, but I don't understand some of the details.  Here is my understanding of his argument.  By definition, 
$$
0 = \phi(\pi) = \pi^k + a_{k-1}\pi^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0
$$
On the left, for every $i$, $v_i(\phi(\pi)) = v_i(0) = \infty$.  On the right, $v_i(\pi^k) = k$, $v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j}) = v_i(a_{j}) + j = nv(a_j) + j$ for $j=0, \ldots, k-1$, and so
$$
v_i(\phi(\pi)) \geq \min(v_i(\pi^k), v_i(a_{j}\pi^{j})) = \min(k, nv(a_j) + j)
$$
where $j$ ranges from $0$ to $k-1$.  If $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$, then equality holds in the last displayed equation, which contradicts that the left-hand side is infinite.  Alex asserts that $k \neq nv(a_j) + j \neq nv(a_l) + l$ for all $j \neq l$ holds if $k < n$, meaning $k < n$ is impossible.  I do not understand why this assertion should be ture Part 2: I also want to show that the minimal polynomial of $\pi$ over $K$,

\phi(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \qquad (a_i \in K),
$$
is Eisenstein with respect to $v$ (that is, $v(a_{i}) > 0$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$ and $v(a_0) = 1$ [I think this is what Eisenstein with respect to $v$ means]). Based on the formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m} e_i f_i = n$, I know that $v$ has only one extension to $F$, $v_1$, with $e_1 = n$, $f_1 = 1$, and irreducible element $\pi_1 = \pi$.  So $\pi$ is the unique irreducible element of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and every nonzero element $\alpha$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ factors as
$$
\alpha = \epsilon \pi^{a}
$$
for some unit $\epsilon$ in $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ and some $a \geq 0$.  Since the quotient field of $\overline{\mathfrak{O}}_{v}$ is $F$, any nonzero $\alpha$ in $F$ can be expressed as above if we allow  $a$ to range through the integers. That is where I am stuck.

My first attempt is this. In $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_p]$, $1-\zeta_p$ is prime and
$$
p = \epsilon^{-1} (1-\zeta_p)^{p-1}

Is this even the right way to proceed? Uniqueness is not clear to me either.

30142,Representing Ternary as Binary: Probability that the first $n$ bits are all zero,"I'm using the ternary numeral system, i.e. numbers in base 3.  There's a catch:  The numbers I'm representing will never have a 2 as a digit.  For instance, I use 0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,...  I.e. they look like binary digits, but they're really ternary numbers. Now I'd like to know, for a random ternary number, in this form, of $m$ digits, what is the probability that the first (least significant) $n$ bits are all zero? EXAMPLE For $m=3$, we'd have the following numbers written out in base 3 (remember they only look like they're bits): 000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111.  These correspond to the decimal values 0,1,3,4,9,10,12,13 respectively.  So representing these in binary, they are 0,1,11,100,1001,1010,1100,1101 respectively.  If I take $n=2$, I'd be finding the probability that the 2 least significant bits are all zero.  Of the numbers in binary, 0,100, and 1100 have the 2 least significant bits as zero.  So out of the 8 possible numbers that I have, 3 have this property.  So the probability that I'm looking for is 3/8. Now, I'm asking, for generalized $m$ and $n$ using this system, what are the probabilities?",['combinatorics']

Starting with something we know to be true, we can do $$1 = \iint \delta^{(2)}(x,y) dx\,dy = \int_0^\infty \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\delta(r)}{\pi r} r\,dr\,d\theta = 2 \int_0^\infty \delta(r).$$ This suggests that the integral of delta function from 0 to infinity is 1/2.  In fact, this seems to make sense if we treat the delta function as a limiting case of an even function peaked at zero (Gaussian, sinc, etc.)  However, Wikipedia, citing Bracewell, claims the following to be true: $$\int_0^\infty \delta(r-a) e^{-s r} dr = e^{-s a},$$
and plugging in 0 for a and s we get $$\int_0^\infty \delta(r) dr = 1.$$ What is going on here?..  Where's the screw-up?..

For any $\chi \in \hat{\Delta}:=Hom(\Delta, \mathbb{Z}_p^{\times})$ they define $e_{\chi}:= \frac{1}{|\Delta|} \sum_{\delta \in \Delta} \chi(\delta)\delta^{-1}$ (I recognize this from normal representation theory) and $M^{\chi}:=e_{\chi}M$ (so $M=\oplus_{\chi \in \hat{\Delta}} M^{\chi}$). They define the ""cyclotomic character"" as $\delta(\zeta_p)=\zeta_p^{\omega(\delta)}$, which doens't make a whole lot of sense since this only determines $\omega(\delta)$ mod $p$. But since it would have to be a $p^{th}$ root of unity in $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$, it does determine it, and therefore does make sense. Now they say that if $K$ is the compositum of $k(\zeta_p)$ with a $G$-Galois extension of $k$ that is linearly disjoint from $k(\zeta_p)$ then (is all of this necessary? probably not): $dim_{\mathbb{F}_p}(O_K^{\times} \otimes \mathbb{F}_p)^{\chi}$ is $rank_{\mathbb{Z}_p}(O_K^{\times} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p)^{\chi}$ if $\chi \neq \omega$ and $rank_{\mathbb{Z}_p}(O_K^{\times} \otimes \mathbb{Z}_p)^{\chi} +1$ if $\chi=\omega$.

The following is my proof and below it, my concerns. Proof (1) We will prove $s_n$ is increasing by induction. That is $s_n \leq s_{n+1}$ for all n $\in \mathbb{N}$. Since $$s_1 = 1 < s_2 = \frac{1}{4}(2(1)+5) = \frac{7}{4}$$ Now assume $s_k$ $\leq $ $s_{k+1}$ Then $$s_{k+2} = \frac{1}{4} (2s_{k+1} + 5) \geq \frac{1}{4} (2s_k +5) = s_{k+1}$$ Therefore, $s_n$ is a monotone sequence because it is increasing. (2a) We will prove $s_n$ is bounded above. That is, find $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $s_n \leq M$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now, we try to prove $20$ is an upper bound. Since $s_1 = 1 < 20$ Suppose $s_k < 20$, then $$s_{k+1} = \frac{1}{4}(2s_k + 5) < \frac{1}{4}(2(20) + 5) = \frac{45}{4} < 20. $$ 
Hence, $s_n < 20$ for every n $\in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, $s_n$ is bounded above. (2b) We will prove $s_n$ is bounded below. That is, find $M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $s_n \geq M$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Now, we try to prove $0$ is a lower bound. Since $s_1 = 1 > 0$ Suppose $s_k > 0$, then $$s_{k+1} = \frac{1}{4}(2s_k + 5) > \frac{1}{4}(2(0) + 5) = \frac{5}{4} > 0. $$ Hence, $s_n > 0$ for every n $\in \mathbb{N}$.

30468,Proving that $\mathbb{Q}$ is neither open or closed in $\mathbb{R}$,"I need to figure out if $\mathbb{Q}$ is either open or closed in $\mathbb{R}$ and prove my assertions. I don't think it's either. I would like a review/critique of my proofs to make sure that there's not an easier way to do it. To see that it's not open, take some $\frac{m}{n}$ with both $m$ and $n$ perfect squares so that $\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is rational. We have that $x \mapsto x^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is continuous. Hence for any $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $\left(\frac{m}{n}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, there exists a $\delta$-neighborhood of $\frac{m}{n}$ that maps into it. but $$
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{m}{n} - \frac{cm}{cn + 1} < \delta &\Leftrightarrow& \frac{m}{n(cn + 1)} < \delta n(cn + 1) \\
&\Leftrightarrow& \frac{m}{\delta n^{2}} < \left(nc^{2} + 1\right)^{2} \\
&\Leftrightarrow& \frac{m}{\delta n^{4}} < c^2 + \frac{2}{n}c + \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\
&\Leftrightarrow& \frac{m}{\delta n^{4}} < \left(c + \frac{1}{n}\right)^{2} \\
&\Leftrightarrow& \left(\frac{m}{\delta n^{4}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{n} < c
\end{eqnarray*}
$$ So we can make $\frac{cm}{cm + 1}$ as close to $\frac{m}{n}$ as we like by taking $c$ sufficiently large. If $cm$ is a perfect square, then $c$ must be a perfect square because $m$ is so we can just choose a $c$ that's not a perfect square and hence $\left(\frac{cm}{cn +1}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ is irrational. Because we can place an irrational arbitrarily close to at least one positive rational, $\mathbb{Q}$ is not open. To show that $\mathbb{Q}$ is not closed, simply pick some irrational $\alpha$ and let $\epsilon_n = \frac{1}{n}$. Let $x_n$ be chosen from between $\alpha - \epsilon_n$ and $\alpha$. Then the sequence $x_n$ converges to $\alpha$ which shows that the complement of $\mathbb{q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is not open as we can place a rational in any $\epsilon$-neighborhood of any irrational. Proving that the rationals aren't open was so much harder than proving that they're not closed because my book hadn't proved that the irrationals are dense in $\mathbb{R}$ and so I couldn't use that. Is there some other way that I could do this?","['general-topology', 'real-analysis']"

30503,"Divergence Theorem, Laplacian, Energy Minimization","I am trying to understand a proof for critical points of certain energy functions being harmonic functions. It goes as follows: For a function $u(x_1,..,x_n)$, a functional E(u) is defined as $E(u) = \frac{1}{2}\int |\nabla u|^2 $ For the proof, a curve is constructed in the space of functions by using $u+t\phi$. Restricting the energy functional to this curve gives: $E(u+t\phi) = \frac{1}{2} \int | \nabla (u+t\phi)|^2 = 
\frac{1}{2} \int |\nabla u|^2 + t \int \langle u,\nabla \phi \rangle +

$ Then differentiating at $t=0$ $\frac{d}{dt_{t=0}}E(u+t\phi) = \int \langle\nabla u, \nabla \phi\rangle = - \int \phi \triangle u$ The proof then states that the last equality is due to divergence theorem which I know is $\int \int_S F \cdot n d\sigma = \int \int \int \nabla \cdot F dV$ I do not understand the connection between divergence theorem and how it is used in this proof.

30556,A finite ring is a field if its units $\cup\ \{0\}$ comprise a field of characteristic $\ne 2$,"Suppose $R$ is a finite ring (commutative ring with $1$) of characteristic $3$ and suppose that for every unit $u \in R\:,\ 1+u\ $ is also a unit or $0$. We need to show that $R$ is a field. Is this true if ${\rm char}(R) > 3$? Here is what I attempted to do. $\:$  First of all, $\:$ I noticed that the statement is not true if $\ R\ $ is infinite ($ \mathbb F_3[x]$ is an example of an infinite ring which is not a field but it satisfies all the required properties). Now, in a finite ring, a non-zero element is either a unit or a $\:0\:$ divisor, so I tried to show that $R$ has no $\:0\:$ divisors. Clearly, $R$ has no nonzero nilpotent elements (if $x$ is nilpotent, then $1+x$ is a unit, but then $1+(1+x)$ and $1+(2+x)$ is either a unit or $\:0\:.\:$ Hence $x$ is either a unit or $\:0\:,\:$ and since $x$ is nilpotent, it can't be a unit, so we must have $x = 0$). But this does not solve the problem, since $R$ could have elements that are $\:0\:$ divisors but not nilpotent (for example, $\ (1,0)\ $ is a $\:0\:$ divisor in $\ \mathbb Z/3\:\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z/3\:\mathbb Z\ $ but it is not nilpotent). Another observation I made is that the set of units, together with $\:0\:$ forms a group under addition, so that $J = R^{*}$, together with $\:0\:$ is a subring of $R$. hence we may view $R$ as a $J$-module (and since $J$ is clearly a field, $R$ is a $J$-vector space). Another thing I tried is to show that $R$ has no proper nontrivial ideals. Viewing $R$ and $J$ as abelian groups, I noticed that a non-trivial ideal of $R$ can contain at most one element from each coset of $J$ in $R$, because if an ideal contains two distinct elements from the same coset of $J$ in $R$, this ideal would have to contain their difference, hence it'd have to contain a unit, hence it would not be a proper ideal. But again, I don't see how this observation leads to a solution. As for the last part, I suspect that this statement will remain true if ${\rm char}(R) > 3$. Since $1$ is a unit, it follows that $1,2,3,\ldots$ are all either units or $0$, which can only happen if ${\rm char}(R) = p$, a prime number (and then I suspect that $R$ will have to be a finite field), but again  I do not see how to prove (or disprove) this. By the way, this is not a homework problem. I am studying algebra on my own, and after thinking about it for a few days and making the observations I listed above, I still don't see how to finish the proof. I would appreciate your suggestions.

I've been trying to learn about Grothendieck's Existence Theorem, but it seems that there aren't very many places that talk about formal schemes and even less that come up with examples. Suppose $(\mathfrak{X}, \mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{X})$ is a Noetherian formal scheme and let $\mathcal{I}$ be an ideal of definition. Then we have a system of schemes $X_n=(|\mathfrak{X}|, \mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{X}/\mathcal{I}^n)$. If the inverse system $\Gamma(X_n, \mathcal{O}_{X_n})\to \Gamma(X_{n-1}, \mathcal{O}_{X_{n-1}})$ satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition (the images eventually stabilize), then we get some particularly nice properties such as $Pic(\mathfrak{X})=\lim Pic(X_n)$. More generally, we don't have to be worried about converting between thinking about coherent sheaves on the formal scheme and thinking about them as compatible systems of coherent sheaves on actual schemes. My question is, is there a known example of a formal scheme for which that system of global sections does not satisfy the Mittag-Leffler condition? One thing to note is that it can't be affine (the maps are all surjective) or projective (finite dimensionality forces the images to stabilize). A subquestion is whether or not there is a general reason to believe such an example exists. People I talk to usually say things along the lines of: you definitely have to be careful here because in principle this could happen. But no one seems to have ever thought up an example.

Let $\mu$ be a finite positive borel measure on $\mathbb{R}$. Then $\int (x-y)^{-2} d \mu (y) = \infty $ almost everywhere on $\mu$ (for the selection of x's). This is a question I had in an exam, and the answer is supposed to be presented in less than 30 words, so there must be something quite simple I'm missing.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"
30708,Limit involving exponential functions,"I am trying to figure out why this is true: $$ \lim_{p \to 0}\frac{1}{2p}\left((1+p)e^{-\frac{y}{1+p}} - (1-p)e^{-\frac{y}{1-p}}\right) = e^{-y} + ye^{-y}$$ I have already tried L'Hopital's Rule, but it gave me something that I couldn't simplify. The problem seems to be the $\frac{1}{2p}$ term never seems to go away. I know the exponential function can be represented as: $e^x = \lim_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{x}{n})^n$, but it doesn't seem immediately obvious how that would apply in this situation. Thanks.","['calculus', 'limits']"

30717,Compactness of a bounded operator $T\colon c_0 \to \ell^1$,"Pitt Theorem says that any bounded linear operator $T\colon \ell^r \to \ell^p$, $1 \leq p < r < \infty$, or $T\colon c_0 \to \ell^p$ is compact. I know how to prove this in case $\ell^r \to \ell^p$, and $c_0 \to \ell^p$, where $p > 1$. Main idea in the first case is that $\ell^r$ is reflexive and hence closed ball $B_{\ell^r}$ is weakly compact. In the second case we could just use Schauder Theorem ($T$ is compact if and only if $T^*$ is compact). The only case left is $T\colon c_0 \to \ell^1$. I have tried something like this: By Schauder Theorem we need to prove that $T^*\colon \ell^\infty \to \ell^1$ is compact. By Banach-Alaoglu Theorem we know that $B_{\ell^\infty}$ is compact in the $weak^{*}$ topology on $\ell^\infty$. Moreover, we know, since $\ell^1$ is separable, that $B_{\ell^\infty}$ is metrizable. Hence, it is enough to prove that if $(x_n)$ is a $weak{}^{*}$ convergent (say, to $x$) sequence in $B_{\ell^\infty}$ then $(Tx_n)$ converges (to $Tx$, I think). Since Schur Theorem (weak and norm convergence is the same in $\ell^1$) we only need to show that $(Tx_n)$ converges weakly in $\ell^1$. And here I stuck. Could you give me any ideas or references? In every book I have looked so far this particular case was omitted. Edit (4.4.2011): I found in Diestel's Sequences and series in Banach spaces (chap. VII, Exercise 2(ii)) something like this: A bounded operator $T: c_0 \to X$ is compact if and only if every subseries of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty Te_n$ is convergent, where $(e_n)$ is canonical basis for $c_0$. I know how to prove this, but how we can show that operators $T: c_0 \to \ell^1$ possess the subseries property?","['operator-theory', 'compact-operators', 'functional-analysis', 'banach-spaces']"
30731,Will two convex hulls overlap?,"I ran into the following problem while working in neural nets. Given natural numbers $b$ and $r$, uniformly randomly choose $b+r$ points within a unit square. Call the $b$ points the blue points and the $r$ points red points . What is the probability $p(b,r)$ that the convex hull of the blue points, $H_b$ , overlaps with $H_r$? Partial answer : I can't immediately think of anything but a multi-fold brute-force integral for this. Intuitively, it seems to me (I could be incorrect) that $p(b,r)$ has to satisfy $\lim_{b\rightarrow \infty} p(b,r)   = 1$ and likewise $p(b,r) \rightarrow 0$ as $b$ or $r$ approach 0. Also, given $b$ random points, we can compute the expected size of its convex hull according to this paper , though it's not clear to me how to use this. I don't know how to connect  these disparate hints at solution and would like suggestions.","['probability-theory', 'geometry']"
30732,How can I evaluate $\sum_{n=0}^\infty(n+1)x^n$?,"How can I evaluate $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{2n}{3^{n+1}}$$ ?
I know the answer thanks to Wolfram Alpha , but I'm more concerned with how I can derive that answer. It cites tests to prove that it is convergent, but my class has never learned these before. So I feel that there must be a simpler method. In general, how can I evaluate $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)x^n?$$","['geometric-series', 'power-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'faq']"
30742,Probability distribution for distances between randomly selected integers within an interval,"Suppose I pick 'N' integers over an interval [A, B] without replacement.  As a function of 'N' and the interval length, what distribution / average values should I expect for the distances between nearest-neighbors in a sorted array of the selected integers? Edit: I apologize, an important note is that the distances between the endpoints and the nearest integers to the endpoints should also be included.  This is a bit like dividing a piece of rope into (B - A + 1) segments, cutting at the locations representing the 'N' selected integers, and looking at the distribution of cut rope lengths. Edit 2:  Apparently this question is in desperate need of clarification.  Extending the rope example I provided, here's exactly what I'm looking for: Upon cutting the rope into 'N' pieces, and placing these pieces in a bag, I would very much like the probability, P(k), of randomly selecting a fragment of rope of length 'k' from this bag.  Here, the probability of selecting a particular fragment of the rope is independent of its length.  The function for P(k) provides what I'd like to know about the distribution of rope lengths after 'N' cuts.","['probability-distributions', 'probability']"
