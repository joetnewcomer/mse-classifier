2786982,Are operators functions? (cont.),"Undergraduate here. Some time ago I had a discussion with a friend on whether or not an operator is a function. The debate centered on this issue: I believed all operators are functions, while my friend believed not all operators are functions. I acknowledge the past questions asked regarding this issue, but intend for this question to build on previous discussions. Argument: All operators are functions My argument that an operator is a function is this: since the input and output of an operator is a function, then it fits the definition of a function: ""A relation $f$ is a function provided $(a,b),(a,c)\in f$ implies $b=c$."" In addition, the majority of online resources claim that operators are functions: On Quora , answers state that the operator is either ""a special type of function"" or exactly a function. In StackExchange, here , and here , the operator is also ""a special kind of function,"" etc. Wikipedia states that an operator is a mapping, and since mappings are functions, operators are therefore functions. (I'll note that the reliability of Wikipedia is debated and questioned here .) On my conceptual interpretation of the operator and the literature surrounding it, I came to support the argument that all operators are functions. Argument: Not all operators are functions My friend argued that there exist operators that do not conform to the definition of the function. He lists these operators as examples: The indefinite integral operator $\int$, in which $\int dt(f(t))=F(t)+C$ an arbitrary constant $C$. A square root operator $S$, where $S(f)=\pm\sqrt f$. A less-than operator $T$, where $T(f)=g$ for all $g<f$. A random number generator $U$, where $U(f)=x$ for some random number $x$. Since for any of these functions, the input of a function can correspond to an output of two or more distinct functions, it follows that not all operators are functions. We agreed that if all operators are functions, then the indefinite integral operator and co. are not operators. However, I also couldnâ€™t ignore the literature online. I consulted with two professors. One suggested a correction on the indefinite integral, and it return an equivalence class of functions, instead of multiple distinct functions, for some function input, so technically there is one output. Although this argument fits the integral operator as a function, it seems to contradict the definition given by Wikipedia, where domain and codomain are the same. The other said that the definition of an operator depends on the math field we are working in. Our (frankly enjoyable) debate thus stopped without conclusion, but I believed that progress would be made if we were given a rigorous (and preferably, widely accepted) definition of an operator, instead of working with what we think what an operator is. Thank you for reading, and my key questions are below: How are operators defined? If definitions vary depending on field, please give a working definition in your field. Are operators functions? Depending on the definition, this answer may differ. If operators are not functions, please give some counterexample. (Some extra context: we both were in Intro to Quantum and read Gasiorowicz, and where I was first exposed to the idea of operators and operator manipulations such as $(\frac{d}{dx})^2=\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$. I thought if I really understand what an operator is, then this type of manipulation would be intuitive and founded. I also understand that there exists a relation between operators and transformations.)","['terminology', 'operator-theory', 'functions', 'definition']"
2786999,"Can I use Leibniz' rule to differentiate when integral is $\int_0^\gamma f(\gamma,s)dF(s)$, instead of $\int_0^\gamma f(\gamma,s)ds$ ($F$ is a CDF)","Specifically, suppose I have a CDF $F$ and an integral

Can I still use Liebniz rule even though my integral is of the form $\int_0^\gamma f(\gamma,s)dF(s)$, instead of $\int_0^\gamma f(\gamma,s)ds$ (if $F$ is differentiable than I can (rigorously/correctly) write $dF(s) = f(s)ds$ and have the standard form.

2787011,Convergence of a Series with Infinitely Many Increasing Terms,"I'm working on the following problem: Let $\{ c_n \}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence such that $c_n = \frac{1}{n^2}$ if $n$ is odd, and $c_n = \frac{1}{n^4}$ if $n$ is even. Prove that (i) $c_{n+1} > c_n$ for infinitely many $n$ and (ii) $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} c_n$ converges. My attempt: (i) We claim that when $n$ is even, 
$$c_{n+1} > c_n$$
and proceed via induction. First, note that for $n=2$, 
$$c_3 = \frac{1}{9} > \frac{1}{16} = c_2.$$
Now, suppose that $c_{k+1} > c_k$ for some even $k$. Then, we prove that 
\begin{align*}
c_{k+3} &> c_{k+2} \\
\frac{1}{(k+3)^2} &> \frac{1}{(k+2)^4} \\
\end{align*}
by showing that 
$$(k+2)^4 > (k+3)^2.$$
Accordingly,
\begin{align*}
(k+2)^4 &= k^4 + 8k^3 + 24k^2 + 32k + 16 \\
&>^{I.H.} (k^2 + 2k + 1) + 8k^3 + 24k^2 + 32k + 16 \\
&= 8k^3 + 25k^2 + 34k + 17. \\
\end{align*}
Now,
\begin{align*}
8k^3 + 25k^2 + 34k + 17 &> (k+3)^2 \\
\Rightarrow 8k^3 + 24k^2 + 28k + 8 &> 0 \\
\end{align*}
holds as $k>0$ and each coefficient of the polynomial is positive. Thus, $c_{n+1} > c_n$ for each even $n$. (ii) To see that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} c_n$ converges, we first note that $$ |(-1)^{n-1} c_n | = c_n \leq \frac{1}{n^2} \qquad \forall n \in \mathbb{N} $$ Further, $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$ converges via $p$-Test with $p = 2 > 1$, so $$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} c_n $$ converges via the Weierstrass M-test. Is this sound reasoning? The inductive portion seems long, as the result is somewhat intuitive. Is there an shorter way to prove this?","['sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"
2787031,Maximizing $3\sin^2 x + 8\sin x\cos x + 9\cos^2 x$. What went wrong?,"Let $f(x) = 3\sin^2 x + 8\sin x\cos x + 9\cos^2 x$. For some $x \in \left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$, $f$ attains its maximum value, $m$. Compute $m + 100 \cos^2 x$. What I did was rewrite the equation as $f(x)=6\cos^2x+8\sin x\cos x+3$. Then I let $\mathbf{a}=\left<6\cos x,8\cos x\right>$ and $\mathbf{b}=\left<\cos x,\sin x\right>$. Using Cauchy-Schwarz, I got that the maximum occurs when $\tan x=\frac{4}{3}$, and that the maximum value is $10\cos x$. However, that produces a maximum of $9$ for $f(x)$, instead of the actual answer of $11$. What did I do wrong, and how do I go about finding the second part?

2787103,How do I show that partial derivatives are continuous?,"The theorem says that for $f$ to be differentiable, partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are continuous. For example, let $f(x,y)=x^2+2xy+y^2.$ Let $(a,b)\in R^2.$ Then, I know that partial derivatives exist and $f_x(a,b)=2a+b,$ and $f_y(a,b) = a+2b$. In order to test the continuity, $$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f_x(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}2x+y=2a+b=f_x(a,b). $$
$$\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}f_y(x,y)=\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)}x+2y=a+2b=f_y(a,b).$$ Is this the right way to check whether partial derivatives are continuous on $(a,b)$ for the multivariable case?","['multivariable-calculus', 'real-analysis']"
2787111,Continuity of Un-plottable Piece-wise Defined Function,"I'm working on the following problem: Consider the function
$$f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x + x^2 & x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
x - x^2 & x \notin \mathbb{Q} \\
\end{cases}
$$
Prove that $f$ is nowhere continuous except at $x=0$. My attempt: First, we show that $f$ is continuous at $x=0$. Accordingly, fix $\epsilon > 0$, and choose $\delta < \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4 \epsilon}}{2}$ (note that since the quantity on the left hand side is strictly positive, the Archimedean Principle guarantees the existence of such a $\delta$). 
Then, if 
$$ |x - 0| = |x| < \delta$$
then
$$ |f(x) - f(0)| = |f(x)| =  
\begin{cases}
|x + x^2| & x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
|x - x^2| & x \notin \mathbb{Q} \\
\end{cases}
$$
In either case, the triangle inequality gives that
\begin{align*}
|f(x)| &\leq |x| + |x|^2 \\
&< \delta + \delta^2 \\
&= \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{1+4 \epsilon} + 1 - 2\sqrt{1 + 4 \epsilon} + 1 + 4 \epsilon}{4} \\
&= \frac{4\epsilon}{4} \\
&= \epsilon
\end{align*}
Thus, for arbitrary $\epsilon>0$, $\exists \delta > 0$ s.t.
$$ |x - 0| < \delta $$
implies
$$ |f(x) - f(0)| < \epsilon,$$ 
so $f$ is continuous at $x=0$. Now, consider some real $x_0 \neq 0$. It follows from the Sequential Density of Irrationals/Rationals that there exists some sequence $u_n$ of rational numbers that converges to $x_0$, and there exists some sequence $v_n$ of irrational numbers that also converges to $x_0$. Now, since the limits $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} u_n = x_0$ and  $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} v_n = x_0$ exist, we conclude that $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(u_n) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} u_n + u_n^2 = x_0 + x_0^2$$ 
and 
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(v_n) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} v_n + v_n^2 = x_0 - x_0^2.$$
Since these limits are distinct for $x_0 \neq 0$, it follows that either the image of $u_n$ or the image of $v_n$ under $f$ does not converge to $f(x_0)$. Thus, $f$ is not continuous for any $x_0 \neq 0$. Is this a valid proof? I'm concerned I jumped in a bit too eagerly - is it necessary to include the former proof of continuity? Or does it suffice to say the images limit to the same value only when $x_0$ is identically 0?","['continuity', 'piecewise-continuity', 'analysis']"

2787400,Show that these circles are linked (their linking number is $\pm 1$),"There are two circles given in 3 dimensions:

Show that their linking number is $\pm 1$, where the linking number is defined by:
$$L(c_0,c_1) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{(c_0(t)-c_1(s),\dot c_0(t),\dot c_1(s))}{|c_0(t)-c_1(s)|^3}\,dt\ ds$$

$$\text{then } \ \dot c(t) = (c_1'(t),c_2'(t),c_3'(t))$$
Usually the integral for the linking number is very difficult to calculate, so there are other options too. For example, since we know that our curves are circles, their linking number can only be $L(c_0,c_1) \in \{-1,0,+1\}$. Showing that an integral is equal to a specific value can be done with this following technique:
$$L(c_0,c_1) \stackrel{?}{=} a \in \{-1,0,+1\} \iff \\ 
\iff \forall \varepsilon \in \Bbb{R}^+: a - \varepsilon \stackrel{?}{\le} L(c_0,c_1) \stackrel{?}{\le} a + \varepsilon $$
So far I've shown that the circles don't intersect, meaning that there are no $\phi \in \ [0,2\pi[$ values for which $|c_0(\phi)-c_1(\phi)| = 0$. That was relatively easy to show. But the big question is:
$$L(c_0,c_1) \stackrel{?}{=} \pm 1$$
I would appreciate any insight on how I could possibly show this. In other words, how can we show that the above integral is approximately equal to $1$, with perhaps numerical methods?","['circles', 'multivariable-calculus', 'knot-theory', 'definite-integrals', 'differential-geometry']"

2787474,How to construct a Poisson process not based on Lebesgue measure?,"It is clear to me that I can build a suitable underlying probability space for a homogeneous Poisson point process . It is enough to have a pobability space $(\Omega,\mathcal A,P)$ with on it iid random variables $X_1,X_2,\dots$ having exponential distribution. So I could do already with $\mathbb R^{\mathbb N}$ applied with product measure. Then $N_t$ can be defined as the cardinality of the set $\{n\mid S_n\leq t\}$ where $S_n:=X_1+\dots+X_n$. If $A$ is a measurable subset of $[0,\infty)$ then I can define random variable $\hat A$ as the (random) cardinality of $\{n\mid S_n\in A\}$ and then $\hat A$ has Poisson-distribution with a (multiple of) $\lambda(A)$ as parameter, where $\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure. In that sense it can be called a Poisson process on base of the Lebesgue measure . Now my question: How to build up a probability space allowing me to construct a Poisson process based on an arbitrary chosen measure $\nu$ on $[0,\infty)$ with the property that $\nu([0,t])<\infty$ for each $t$? So this means that for a measurable $A\subseteq[0,\infty)$ the random cardinality of $\{n\mid S_n\in A\}$ has Poisson-distribution with parameter $\nu(A)$.

Now, this implies that there exists a countable orthonormal basis, but this comes from an abstract type of reasoning, i.e. the Zorn's Lemma for the existence of an orthonormal basis and the use of separability to say that it is countable. The question that came up to me is: is there an explicit representation of this basis? The answer should be no, otherwise the use of the continuous Fourier transform doesn't make much sense, but who knows, perhaps there are some good reasons to prefer the continuous transform even if there is a countable basis.

Define $F(x) = \int_b^x$ Then, from other answers on the site , I know that the jump discontinuity does not affect the value of $F(x)$ $F(x)$ is continuous (since the jump discontinuity did not affect the value of $F(x)$, and $F(x)$ would be continuous/differentiable otherwise) $F(x)$ is not differentiable (at $a$) When i think of a function not being differentiable I normally imagine a kink or a jump. But I don't see how/why $F(x)$ would have a kink/jump (if that is the problem for differentiability). It can't jump because the discontinuity doesn't affect the value of the integral. For a kink I have no intuition I tried computing an example where $$g:[-2,3]\to \mathbb{R} = \begin{cases} 1 & x\not = 0\\ 5 & x=0\end{cases}$$ Then we have, for$G(x)\equiv \int_{-2}^xg$ , that

$$ So the integral is $G(x) = 2+x$, which is continuous and differentiable. So I am messing up the calculation somewhere, but I don't see where?

0 &\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$ It seems that (I don't think its necessary to put the expectation here, but I sort of used it later on when describing equation (1).) $$\mathbb{E}[\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}8Z/n] = \pi$$ but I am not sure why, or even if my conjecture actually holds. (I feel like there is a painfully obvious geometric intuition that is just going right over my head.) I haven't been able to get very far into the problem. But below is my best shot at it. As I progress through this work, I get the impression that I am writing increasingly dubious equations, but this is the closest I could get to anything even containing a constant multiple of $\pi$. It looks to me that $\mathbb{P}[\varphi(i)\neq 0] = \pi/4$ and that this is a Bernoulli random variable. From there, I could see that if $\varphi(i)$ were instead defined by $$\bar{\varphi}(i) =  \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $X_{i}^{2} + Y_{i}^{2}<1$}\\
0 &\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$ I think we get that \begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Z] = \mathbb{E}[n \bar{\varphi}(1)] = n\pi/4, \quad (1)
\end{equation} but I have no idea how to handle the sum of $X^{2}_{i} + Y_{i}^{2}$'s here. Is there a reasonable geometric intuition for why $Z/n$ seems to converge to $\pi/8$? If I naively try to write $$\mathbb{E}[Z] = \mathbb{E}[n\varphi(1)] = \mathbb{E}[n(X^{2} + Y^{2})]\mathbb{P}[\varphi(i)\neq 0]$$ Then since $\mathbb{E}[X^{2}] - \mathbb{E}[X]^{2} = 1/12$, $\mathbb{E}[X^{2}] = (1/12) + (1/4) = 1/3.$ Then we would obtain $$\mathbb{E}[n\varphi(1)] = (\mathbb{E}[(X^{2}]+ \mathbb{E}[Y^{2}])\frac{n\pi}{4} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{n\pi}{4} = \frac{n\pi}{6}$$ which does not seem to hold in my numerical experiments.","['monte-carlo', 'probability-theory']"

2788415,Non-linear system of equations over the positive integers â€” more unknowns than equations,"This exercise appeared on a german online tutoring board and caught my attention but stumbled me for hours. The task is to find 6 distinct positive three digit integers satisfying: $x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}+x_{5}+x_{6}=4.198$ $x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}+x_{5}^{2}+x_{6}^{2}=3.215.224$ $x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}+x_{4}^{3}+x_{5}^{3}+x_{6}^{3}=2.600.350.972$ According to the power mean inequality or Cauchy-Schwarz the numbers must lie relatively closely together. However a brief search lead nowhere.
For simplicity I set $4.198=A$, $3.215.224=B$ and $2.600.350.972=C$ and then my approach was to manipulate the three equations and perhaps use that no square is negative. For example $6B-A^{2}=\sum_{i<j}(x_i-x_j)^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^2+(x_{1}-x_{3})^2+...+(x_{2}-x_{3})^2+...+(x_{5}-x_{6})^2$  where every distinct pair appears exactly once. If now $6B-A^{2}$ would result in something like $5*1^{2}+4*2^{2}+3*3^{2}+2*4^{2}+1*5^{2}=105$
 we could tell exactly what our $x$ were. Unfortunately it gives $1.668.140$ and we cannot conclude much. Similar reasoning with factoring to $\sum_{i<j}(x_i-x_j)^{4}$ didn't help. If there exists such a factorization, my intuition says it would only make sense if the $x$ form an arithmetic sequence, otherwise we would get different factors on the right side that can't appear on the left side. (does this sound reasonable?) But substituting gives no solution. Also, I don't know what other, more sophisticated factorization would lead me to the solution.

As the textbook we are using (Partial Differential Equations, Peter Olver) does not provide clear examples on this topic, I figured that the internet would be a fine next step towards a solution. I also think that some experienced mathematicians out there might enjoy an exercise, and explaining it. Let me be clear: this exercise will not be examined. The problem is as follows: Solve for $u$ where
\begin{align}
-\Delta u (x,y)= \frac{1}{1+y}\text{ on }\{(x,y):y>0\}\text{ and }u(x,0) = 0\text{ for all }x\in \mathbb{R}.
\end{align} Now, we are asked to use the Green's function for the upper half plane to find a solution. Using the method of images, one finds such a function quite easily:
\begin{align}
G(x,y;\theta,\eta) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\log\left(\frac{(x-\theta)^2 + (y-\eta)^2}{(x-\theta)^2+(y+\eta)^2}\right).

By Green's representation formula, the solution is then given by

If the limit: $$\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f'(x)=L$$ exists, then $f'(c)$ exists and its value is $f'(c)=L$. My attempt at proving this was: ""As long as $c \neq a$ and $c\neq b$, then there exists $A \in \left(a, c\right), B \in \left(c, b\right)$ such that $f$ is continuous at $(A, c)\cup(c,B)$ (because $f$ is differentiable in these open intervals), $f$ is continuous at $A$, $B$ and $c$ (because $f$ is differentiable at $A$ and $B$, when the intervals under consideration are $(a,c)$ and $(c,b)$ and $f$ is supposedly continuous at $c$). Then $f$ is (uniformly) continuous in $\left[A,B\right]$. In particular, $f$ is uniformly continuous in every closed interval contained in $\left[A,B\right]$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be given, and let's keep fixed a corresponding $\delta > 0$ which satisfies the uniform continuity. Then $f$ is (uniformly) continuous at $[c-\delta, c]$ and $[c, c+ \delta]$ and differentiable at $(c-\delta, c)$ and $(c, c+ \delta)$, for $\epsilon$ small enough (which makes $\delta$ to be small enough and the intervals $[c-\delta, c]$ and $[c, c+ \delta]$ to be contained in $[A,B]$). By the Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, we have: $$\exists c_1 \in (c- \delta, c): \ f'(c_1)[c-(c-\delta)]=\delta f'(c_1)=f(c)-f(c - \delta)$$
$$\exists c_2 \in (c, c+ \delta): \ f'(c_2)[(c+\delta)-c]=\delta f'(c_2)=f(c + \delta)- f(c)$$ By uniform continuity of $f$, $\epsilon \rightarrow 0 \implies \delta \rightarrow 0$ and, as $c\in (a,b)$ is fixed, $c_1=c_1(\delta(\epsilon), f), c_2=c_2(\delta(\epsilon),f )$, with: $$\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} c_1(\delta(\epsilon), f)= c=\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} c_2(\delta(\epsilon),f)$$ Then, we finally have: $$L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f'(x)=\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} f'(c_1(\delta(\epsilon), f))=\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(c) - f(c-\delta(\epsilon))}{\delta}=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^{-}} \frac{f(c) - f(x)}{c-x}$$ $$L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f'(x)=\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} f'(c_2(\delta(\epsilon), f))=\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(c+\delta(\epsilon))-f(c)}{\delta}=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^{-}} \frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x-c}$$ Since both lateral limits exist and are equal, the theorem is proved and: $$L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c} \frac{f(x)-f(c)}{x-c}\equiv f'(c)$$ q.e.d.""

\\

He proceeds then to state that if $k^2$ is divisible by 3, then so is $k$.
I have a hard time understanding what $k$ he is talking about in these equations, it hasn't been defined earlier. He then proceeds: Supose $\sqrt3$ were rational, and let $\sqrt3 = p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ have no common factor. Then $p^2=3q^2$, so $p^2$ is divisible by 3, so $p$ must be. Thus, $p=3p'$ for some natural number $p'$ and consequently $(3p')^2=3q^2$, or $3(p')^2=q^2$. Thus, $q$ is also divisible by 3, a contradiction. I have a hard time linking the first part where he states that "" $k^2$ being divisible by 3 leads to $k$ being divisible by 3 "" and the second part. Where does the first conclusion come from? NOTE: Problem statement in the book in the same manner requests the proof of $\sqrt5$ and $\sqrt6$ being irrational. However, in this question I'm interested in the proof for the case of $\sqrt3$.","['rationality-testing', 'calculus', 'proof-explanation']"

I want to calculate the integral $\int_H c_1 (\mathcal O(k)|_H)$. I think I got a proof for this, but im am not sure if I got all the details right. I would appreciate if you could take a look on it: First we note that as $c_1(\mathcal O(k))= k \cdot c_1(\mathcal O(1))$, it suffices to consider the case $k=1$. If we denote by $i$ the inclusion map, then $\mathcal O(1)|_C$   The integral above is the pairing 
$$\langle c_1(i^*\mathcal O(1)),[H]\rangle = \langle i^*c_1(\mathcal O(1)),[H]\rangle= \langle c_1(\mathcal O(1)),i_*[H]\rangle.$$ $i_*[H]$ is PoincarÃ© dual to $c_1(\mathcal O[H])$. As $H$ is of degree $d$, we have  $\mathcal O[H])=\mathcal O(d)$. Thus 
$$\langle c_1(i^*\mathcal O(1)),[H]\rangle  = \langle c_1(\mathcal O(1))\cup c_1(\mathcal O(d)),[\mathbb P^2]\rangle  $$ As further $c_1(\mathcal O(1))$ is PoincarÃ© dual to a linear hyperplane which intersects the degree $d$ hypersurface $H$ in exactly $d$ points (counting multiplicities), the PoincarÃ© dual $P$ of $c_1(\mathcal O(1))\cup c_1(\mathcal O(d))$ is the linear combination of these $d$ points. Applying the definition of PoincarÃ© duality on the constant $1$-function, we get 
$$  \langle c_1(\mathcal O(1))\cup c_1(\mathcal O(d)),[\mathbb P^2]\rangle = \langle P, 1|_P\rangle =d. $$ Summarizing we get $\int_H c_1 (\mathcal O(k)|_H)=d\cdot k.$ Is what I wrote right?

If the linked exercise would be true (but it is not) then a locally compact and $\sigma$-compact space would be separable, and because I also know that open sets of locally compact spaces are also locally compact then the proof would be (I guess) easier to prove following this path. However, as I said, the statement of $X$ being locally compact and $\sigma$-compact imply that it is also separable is not true in general. Then its possible that also this part of the exercise is wrong (that is, that the statement to be proved would be false). In any case I dont find something to work to prove the statement.

  integer $k$, find the values for $p$ for which $n = 2k + 1$ is better
  for the Celtics than $n = 2k-1$. When I read this problem statement, I quickly felt certain based on intuition that a longer series is better when $p > 1/2$. Question: Is there a short proof that allows us to see this result at a glance ? Here is a solution to the problem which seems overly complicated, given how obvious the result is intuitively. The calculation below is surely not what my brain did in order to be certain that the answer must be $p > 1/2$. Imagine that the two teams play $2k + 1$ games, and let the random
  variable $N$ be the number of games won by the Celtics during the
  first $2k -1$ games. The probability $p_{2k+1}$ of the Celtics winning
  the ""best of $2k+1$"" series (which requires winning at least $k + 1$
  games in the series) is $$ \tag{1}p_{2k+1} = P(N \geq k+1) + P(N = k)(1 - (1-p)^2) + P(N = k-1)p^2. $$ On the other hand, the probability
  $p_{2k-1}$ of the Celtics winning a ""best of $2k - 1$"" series is  $$ \tag{2} p_{2k-1} = P(N \geq k + 1) + P(N=k). $$ Notice that $P(N=k) = \binom{2k-1}{k}p^k(1-p)^{k-1}$ and $$ P(N = k-1) = \binom{2k-1}{k-1}p^{k-1}(1-p)^k = \binom{2k-1}{k}p^{k-1}(1-p)^k. $$
  Comparing $(1)$ and $(2)$, we see that \begin{align} p_{2k+1} > p_{2k-1}  &\iff P(N=k-1)p^2 > P(N=k)(1-p)^2 \\ &\iff p^{k+1}(1-p)^k > p^k(1-p)^{k+1} \\ &\iff p > \frac12. \end{align} If there is no simpler proof, then why are we so certain at the outset of what the answer must be?","['probability', 'alternative-proof']"

Progress so far : considered some weakly but not strongly convergent sequences, and corresponding series. In all cases the weak convergence turned out to be conditional. For example: let $e_n$ be an orthonormal basis, and consider $x_1=e_1$, $x_n = e_n - e_{n-1}$ for $n>1$. Then the partial sums of $\sum x_n$ are precisely the vectors $e_n$ which converge to zero weakly but not in the norm. However, this weak convergence is conditional: if we take only even-numbered elements
$$x_2+x_4+x_6+\dots = (e_2-e_1) + (e_4-e_3) + (e_6-e_4)+\dots$$
the norm of partial sums tends to $\infty$; and including an odd-numbered $x_n$ once in a million terms will not change that. Since a weakly convergent sequence must be bounded, the rearranged series does not converge weakly.","['functional-analysis', 'weak-convergence', 'hilbert-spaces']"

2789484,What makes radians superior to turns/revolutions?,"1. THE CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM This question came to me when I was exploring complex exponents. The key identity to computing expressions with complex exponents is the Euler's identity: $$e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta$$ This enables us to compute, for example what $2^i$ is by some algebraic manipulation. The computation is as follows: $$2^i=e^{\ln2^i}=e^{i\ln2}=\cos\ln2+i\sin\ln2\;\approx\;0.769+0.639i$$ 2. THE PROBLEM A question arises in my head. We compute sines and cosines with radian values. And since $\ln2\approx0.693$ then $\sin\ln 2$ will be the $y$ coordinate of the unit circle when the angle is $0.693$ radians . But if we use turns instead of radians, then $\sin\ln 2$ will be the $y$ coordinate of the unit circle when the angle is $0.693$ turns . So the value of sine when using turns or radians is different. Similarly, the value of cosine is different. But that creates a problem. When using radians , $2^i$ computes to about $0.769+0.639i$. But when using turns , $2^i$ computes to about $0.994+0.110i$. 3. POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS The problem above illustrates that $2^i$ and any expression with complex exponent is a generalisation that directly depends on what units we use for angles. There are only two possibilities of ""the state of truth"" that this fact implies. Either complex exponents are a concept completely made up by humans which would mean that expressions like these are really undefined to the code of the universe (we only make it defined because we think that radians are the true angle units), or there must be a unit that is the truest unit for measuring angles, whether that would be radians or something else. If the first statement is true, then this would mean that we can accept $2^i$ to be $0.769+0.639i$. After all, this concept would be defined by radians only because we defined it like this. However, if the second statement is true, then there are even more questions to be asked. If there is a ""truest"" unit for measuring angles then what is it? Perhaps radians are really the truest unit, meaning that $2^i$ is unambiguously $0.769+0.639i$, but if so, what justifies this fact? What makes radians truer than turns?","['angle', 'trigonometry', 'complex-numbers', 'foundations']"

2789503,How can I show what the induced metric is?,"I'm unclear on how to solve any of these problems, can someone please help me with what to do? a) Let S be the upper portion of a cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ parametrized by $\phi(u^1,u^2) = (u^1\cos u^2, u^1\sin u^2)$; $u^1 >0$. Show that the induced metric on S from $\phi$ is $$\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\ 0 & (u^1)^2\end{pmatrix}$$ $\phi u_1 = <\cos u^2, \sin u^2, 1>$ and $\phi u_2 = <-u^1\sin u^2, u^1\cos u^2, 0>$ Now do all I have to do is dot product these together? So, $g_{11} = \phi u_1 \cdot \phi u_1 = \cos^2 u^2 + \sin^2 u^2 +1$ $g_{12} = g_{21} = \phi u_1 \cdot \phi u_2 = -u^1\sin u^2 \cos u^2+u^1\cos u^2 \sin u^2$ $g_{22} = \phi u_2 \cdot \phi u_2 = (u^1)^2\sin^2 u^2 +(u^1)^2 \cos u^2$ b) Let $X = (u^1)\partial_1 +\partial_2$, be a vector field on S. Find the length of the vector field X with respect to the metric g. c) Suppose $f: S \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(u^1\cos u^2, u^1\sin u^2, u^1) = (u^1)^2 -(u^1)^2-(u^1)(u^2)$Find X(f), where $X = (u^1)\partial_1 +\partial_2$",['differential-geometry']
2789511,"Bloch's theorem in one dimension, confusion about proof","I was looking at the derivation of Bloch's theorem in Griffith's QM: If $V(x+a)=V(x)$ for any $x$ and some $a$, and
$\psi$ solves
$$
H\psi =\lambda \psi
$$
for $H=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\pi}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V(x)$
then
$$
\psi(x+a)=e^{ika}\psi(x)
$$ The proof relies on the fact that since the shift operator $D\psi(x)=\psi(x+a)$ commutes with the Hamiltonian, we may take an eigenfunction of $H$ to serve as an eigenfunction for $D$. The wikipedia article on the theorem (on a 3 dimensional crystal lattice but the principle is the same) once again asserts the existence of a simultaneous eigenbasis for the two operators. What am I missing here? I know that this is a fact for matrices, but we are working over $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ here, where I don't believe this is true for unbounded self adjoint operators, and it is not clear to me why it should be true with this particular operator (indeed I think it is not). Thanks for any help and I apologize if I am being naive.","['functional-analysis', 'quantum-mechanics', 'mathematical-physics', 'unbounded-operators']"

What are the possible values of $x$? 2 of the choices: (A) $1<x<5$, and (B) $0<x<7$ Solution: According to triangle theorems, 2 sides of a triangle is greater than the 3rd side and their difference is less than the 3rd side. From one of the choices, (ranges $0<x<7$) when $x = 6$: $3 + 4 > 6$ $6 + 4 > 3$ $3 + 6 > 4$ From the above, it means $6$ is a possible value for $x$, and since choice A doesn't have $6$ in it, I chose B as the correct answer. However that isn't the case, the correct answer according to the book is A, which I don't know why. So how was it $1<x<5$? Any help would be appreciated.","['trigonometry', 'geometry']"
2789572,How many possible rankings in a game?,"This is an interesting problem that I have no easy solution for, but an inkling that there may be one! Consider an $n$ player game. If we disallow draws, we know that the number of permutations of $n$ players in that $n$ player game will be $n!$. That's the easy problem. But now let us permit and consider the possibility of draws. What then? I model this tentatively in my own mind as a roll of $n$ $n$-sided dice. For for a four player game 4 dice with 4 sides each (d4 in gamers' parlance). Now that would appear to present $n^n$ permutations. And that seems a good starting point, albeit overestimating the number of rankings considerably because ... ... from a ranking perspective a load of these are invalid or identical depending on how we choose to classify it. But let's consider that to limit the results to valid rankings: A 1 must appear All numbers must be contiguous (adjacent) All numbers must be ascending (order is relevant) We might address the first issue by pinning one outcome to 1, and so only rolling 3 4-sided dice for the remaining 3 players (or $n-1$ $n$-sided dice for the remaining $n-1$ players). Which presents 1/4 as may permutations or a total of $n^{n-1}$ permutations generally. Now from the results we want to exclude all those that have gaps, are not contiguous. On that I am stuck. How to enumerate those if possible. To clarify, this is an illegal ranking we wish not to count (4 player game): 1334 only because it is double counting: 1223 And we also want to enforce ascending order so that these are excluded: 3314 4331 again, only because they double count: 1223 (which is a winner, a tie for second place and someone in 3rd place). which is the same ranking. I figure the best way to avoid this kind of double counting is to demand this ascending contiguity of ranks. How many illegal results then are there in the sample space of $n^{n-1}$ rolls of the $n$-sided die? Or is there a better way to model it?","['combinatorics', 'combinatorial-game-theory']"
