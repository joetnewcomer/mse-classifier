In other words, one can find an injective group homomorphism $\sigma: G\to S_{A}$ where $S$ is the set of all bijections on some set $A$. Can we prove that every group acts faithfully on some group? In other words, given a group $G$, does there exist an injective group homomorphism $\sigma: G\to\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ for
  some group $H$. Here $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ is the group of all (group) isomorphism on $H$. Partial answer: When $G$ has trivial centre, consider the conjugation map $\sigma: G\to\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ defined by $\sigma(g): G\to G$ where $\sigma(g) (a) = g a g^{-1}$. It is easy to see that $\sigma$ is injective. What about when $G$ does not have a trivial centre?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

We have that $(T^\ast M,\omega)$ is a symplectic manifold. Let $g:T^\ast M\to T^\ast M$ be a symplectomorphism that preserves $\alpha$ (i.e. $g^\ast\alpha=\alpha$). I'm trying to show that if for some $(p,\sigma_p)\in T^\ast_p M$ we have $g(p,\sigma_p)=(q,\eta_q)$, then $g(T^\ast_p M)=T^\ast_q M$. So far this is what I have: Let $V\in\Gamma(T(T^\ast M))$ be the symplectic dual of $\alpha$. That is, $\omega(V,\cdot)=\alpha$. Let $\theta$ denote the flow of $V$. I can show that $g\circ\theta_t=\theta_t\circ g$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ or equivalently, that $g_\ast V=V$. I can show that each $\theta_t$ preserves $T_p^\ast M$ for arbitrary $p\in M$. That is, I can show that $\theta_t(T^\ast_p M)=T^\ast_p M$. This follows from actually computing the flow, which turns out to be $\theta_t(p,\mu_p)=(p,e^t\mu_p)$.

861476,"Square root of a squared number changes sign, which to apply first?","Heres something Ive always found interesting. Supose we have a variable $x$, and $x$ equals a negative number: Say: $$x=-17$$ Now, I can apply a square to both sides of the equation and preserve the equality: $$x^2=(-17)^2$$ Now I can apply the square root (or a power of $1/2$) to both sides and preserve the equality: $$√x^2=√(-17)^2$$ Now here comes the thing that confuses me. If I go the algebraic way, the square root cancells the square, and we are back to: $$x=-17$$ However if I first apply the square to -17 : $$√x^2=√289$$ $$x=±17$$ Or if I take only the positive value : $|x|=17$ So you get 2 solutions for x depending on the order of the steps taken So my question is this, which step should be taken first? Secondary related question: Take for instance a complex function with no imaginary part, say: $$F(w)=-\sin(wT)$$ To take the magnitude of $F(w)$ I have to take the absolute value, or the square root of the square of the real part plus the square of the imaginary part.

861551,Definition of Time Series,"Having not done any stats for a few years, I seek clarification regarding the definition of time series given in my textbook. I apologize for the length, but I would be glad to just resolve my main concern (so feel free to ignore my secondary concern). Background: To begin with, a stochastic process is a family of time-indexed random variables $X(\omega, t)$, where $w$ belongs to a sample space and $t$ belongs to an index set. For a given observation $\omega$, $X_{\omega}(t)$ is a function of $t$, which is called a realization of the stochastic process. Definition: A time series is a realization from a certain stochastic process. Main Concern: Does the definition imply that a time series is a single function (the realization of a stochastic process, corresponding to some fixed outcome $\omega$), or is a time series an assignment of time-dependent functions to each element $\omega$ in the sample space $\Omega$? In other words, we define a realization of a stochastic process relative to some fixed element $\omega \in \Omega$. But then is a time series the collection of realizations for each $\omega \in \Omega$, or just a realization for a single outcome? Secondary Concern: Regarding stationary time series, my textbook writes that the exact values of the mean, variance, autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation parameters ""can be calculated if the ensemble of all possible realizations is known. Otherwise, they can be estimated if multiple independent realizations are available."" The ensemble was defined as the collection of all possible realizations in a stochastic process. In light of the authors comments above, this makes me question whether the ensemble refers to the collection of realizations corresponding to each $\omega \in \Omega$ or if, rather, the ensemble consists of all possible realizations for each $\omega \in \Omega$. The way it is defined makes me suspect the latter, but then I don't see how this information would relevant towards determining the above parameters.","['statistics', 'stochastic-processes', 'time-series']"

861557,Intuition behind Khinchin's constant,"Khinchin proved that For almost all reals $r$ with continued fraction representation $[a_o; a_1, a_2, \dots ]$ the sequence $K_n = \left(\prod_{i=1}^{n} a_i\right)^{1/n}$ converges to a constant $K$ ( Khinchin's constant ) independent of $r$ . This is quite surprising, and I was wondering if there is anything deeper going on behind the scenes. Is there something deeper? Is there any intuitive explanation of why this must be true? The proof of the result nowadays seems to go through ergodicity of the Gauss/shift map on a measure equivalent to Lebesgue. It is mentioned in the comments that there is an ""analogous result"" for arithmetic mean of decimals in decimal expansion which feels a lot more intuitive. Perhaps an answer would rephrase or highlight a way to view the standard proof to make it ""just as"" intuitive. By the way, the analogous result doesn't feel like it should be evidence for Khinchin's result. For example, the numbers in decimal sequences are bounded and it basically says the digits are random while Khinchin's result seems to actually show that $a_n$ are actually controlled a lot, while still being unbounded in general. In fact, the arithmetic mean version for continued fractions diverge almost everywhere. Another approach might be more geometric or topological. For example, continued fraction expansions can be seen as train track expansion sequences on the torus, and the real numbers as curves with specified slopes. Also, there is this nice looking paper The Modular Surface and Continued Fractions by Caroline Series which feel promising and might be on the track of giving a geometric/topological reason and interpretations for $K$ ( $K$ isn't explicitly mentioned).","['low-dimensional-topology', 'continued-fractions', 'geometric-topology', 'ergodic-theory', 'number-theory']"

861627,Qual Question concerning martingale,"Suppose $X_n$ is a sequence of random variables that has the property that $\sup|X_n| \leq 1$ a.s. Then use Doob's decomposition to prove that $\sum_{n\geq 1} X_n$ converges a.s. iff the sum $\sum_{n\geq 1}E[X_n\,|\,X_1,X_2,...,X_{n-1}]$ converges a.s. When I posted this question, I received 2 votedowns. I assumed that was because I did not provide my thought on the problem. But at first sight, it's really hard to relate this problem to Doob's decompostion. What I have come up with later is to define $Y_n$=$X_n$-$E[X_{n}\,|\,X_1,X_2,...,X_{n-1}]$, and $S_n$=$\sum_{n\geq 1}Y_n$,then since $Y_n$ has mean zero,$S_n$ should be a martingale. Now |$S_n$| or $S_n^2$ is a submartingale, so now we can use Doob's decompostion, say $S_n^2=M_n+A_n$. I want to show $S_n$ is finite. At first thought, if E$\sup S_n^2$ is finite , then $\sup S_n^2$ is fnite  a.s. hence $\sup S_n$ is fnite a.s.. By martingale property, E$M_n$ is finite. My question now is: Is it possible to show E$A_n$ is finite? $A_n$ is nondecreasing and predictable. How do I rule out the case where its expectation will go to infinity? I think the following might work.
Define $Y_n$ and $S_n$ as before. $S_n$ is a martingale and $\sup|S_{n+1}-S_n|$ is less or equal to 2. There is a theorem that states P(C union D)=1 where C is the set the limit of Sn exists and is finite and D is the set where $\limsup S_n=+\infty$ and $\liminf S_n=-\infty$. On C the sum of Xn is infinity iff the sum of E[Xn|Fn-1] is infinity, while on D both sums are infinity always. Hence the conclusion follows. No, the claim on D is false. On D we can have the finite sum of Xn goes beyond [-M,M] infinitely often while the sum of E[Xn|Fn-1] is finite. Actually, the method described in the last paragraph might work. The problem on D is that the partial sums might not be monotone. But since we have sup|Xn|<=1, Xn+1>=0. Now if we apply the argument in the last paragraph to Yn=Xn+1, then on D, sigma(Yn)=sigma(E(Yn|F(n-1))=+infinity. But the fact sigma(1) is +infinity makes it hard to investigate the behaviors of sigma(Xn) and sigma(E(Xn|F(n-1)).","['probability-theory', 'martingales']"

If  $N$ has a Riemannian metric $h$, at each point $x \in N$ the tangent space $T_x N$ decomposes into an orthogonal direct sum $T_x N = H_x \oplus V_x$, where $V_x := Kerp_∗ = T_x N_{p(x)}$ is the vertical space and $H_x := V_x^ {\perp} $ is the horizontal space.

861674,Decompose a 2D arbitrary transform into only scaling and rotation,"Related to: Newly Developed With Details - Describing orthographic projection using simple 2D transformations Given an arbitrary 2D linear transform (which may include shear, i.e. the vectors or the basis may not form a straight angle), it is possible to decompose it into transforms that are only horizontal/vertical scaling (i.e. matrices of the form $\pmatrix{s_x&0\\0&s_y}$) and pure rotation (i.e. matrices of the form $\pmatrix{\cos \theta&-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta}$). The minimal number of steps to do so is probably 3: Rotate it so that the next scaling step will give it the correct shape. Scale it to give it the proper shape. Rotate it into the final position. In other words, it seems to be always possible to find parameters $\theta, s_x, s_y, \phi$ such that: $$M = \pmatrix{m_{00}&m_{01}\\m_{10}&m_{11}} = \pmatrix{\cos\phi&-\sin\phi\\\sin\phi&\cos\phi}
\pmatrix{s_x&0\\0&s_y}
\pmatrix{\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\\sin\theta&\cos\theta}$$ I don't know if it's always possible to do so. I have the hunch that it is. I could not figure out how; I got a big system of nonlinear equations when I tried by myself. That decomposition has 4 d.o.f. as does the original linear transform, which hints that if it's correct, then it's minimal (you can't do it with 2 rotations or 2 scalings, and you don't have enough d.o.f. with 1 rotation + 1 scaling). I tried with Inkscape and trial and error, and I could not find any rhomboid I couldn't transform into a square, but I might have not tried hard enough. My questions: Is that decomposition always possible? Already answered by Rahul in a comment (thanks!): it's called Singular Value Decomposition ) If so, how to calculate $\theta, s_x, s_y, \phi$? If not, how can it be done in the least number of steps? (Mooted by the answer to question 1). (New question) I found a solution with 4 (sometimes 5) steps, posted in the linked question but it was somewhat convoluted. However, the SVD seems to be complex to calculate. Should I just go with my 4-5 step solution, or is there a simple enough way to perform the decomposition? I've found this answer: https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/8899/robust-algorithm-for-2x2-svd but it looked kind of overkill and I don't understand how to use the code for this case.

861791,Characterizing a sequence of primes,"This is an attempt to finish up Characterizing the primes which don't divide any Pell-Lucas number(s) For primes $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4,$ there is always some solution to $x^2 - 2 y^2 = \pm 1$ with $x \equiv 0 \pmod p.$ For primes $p \equiv 5 \pmod 8,$ never. For primes $p = 4 x^2 + 4 x y + 9 y^2 $ or $p = 4 x^2 + 4 x y + 33 y^2, $ always; these are $1 \pmod 8.$ Put another way, these predictable $1 \pmod 8$ primes are $p = u^2 + 8 v^2$ with $v$ required odd, then $p = u^2 + 32 v^2$ with $v$ required odd. What I am left with is a separation of the primes $p = x^2 + 128 y^2$ into two subsets, one about a third of the primes and the other two thirds.

861814,Derangement bijection,"This is a generalization of this question . An $(n,k)$ partial permutation is an injection from $[k]$ to $[n]$ . It can be thought of as word of length $k$ in symbols in $[n]$ without duplications. An $(n,k)$ partial derangement is an $(n,k)$ partial permutation where the $i$ th symbol is not $i$ . A good $(n,k)$ partial permutation is a $(n,k)$ partial permutation that when $n+1$ is appended to the $k+1$ st position the resulting word never has $i+1$ directly following $i$ .  In other words if the we represent the extended partial permutation as a function $\sigma$ then for any $j$ , $\sigma(j)+1 \ne \sigma(j+1)$ . It is not hard to show by inclusion-exclusion that there are the same number of good partial permutations as there are partial derangements. Is there a simple bijection? Also, if the number of either is $d_{n,k}$ , then $d_{n,k}$ satisfies two recurrences. $$d_{n,k} = (n-1) d_{n-1,k-1} + (k-1)d_{n-2,k-2}$$ and $$(n-k) d_{n,k} = d_{n,k+1} + d_{n-1,k}$$ Do either of these have nice combinatorial descriptions for good partial permutations? To clarify: If we let $\text{pd}(n,k)$ be the partial derangements, and $\text{gpp}(n,k)$ the good partial permutations, then $$ \text{pd}(4,0)=\text{gpp}(4,0)=\emptyset$$ $$\text{pd}(4,1)=\{2,3,4\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,1)=\{1,2,3\}$$ $$\text{pd}(4,2)=\{21,23,24,31,34,41,43\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,2)=\{13,21,31,32,41,42,43\}$$ $$\text{pd}(4,3)=\{214,231,234,241,312,314,341,342,412,431,432\}$$ $$\text{gpp}(4,3)=\{132,142,143,213,241,243,321,413,421,431,432\}$$ Note that $312\notin \text{gpp}(4,3)$ as it contains 12 consecutively and $314\notin \text{gpp}(4,3)$ as if we append 5 to get 3145 we have 4 and 5 consecutively. Edit: Added the combinatorial explanations of the recurrences for partial derangements. To see that the first recurrence $$d_{n,k} = (n-1) d_{n-1,k-1} + (k-1)d_{n-2,k-2}$$ holds for partial derangements we describe a 
bijection that takes an $(n,k)$ partial derangement $\sigma$ to a pair $(\hat\sigma,l)$ where $\hat\sigma$ is either an $(n-1,k-1)$ partial derangement and and $l$ is an integer in $[n]\setminus\{k\}$ or $\hat\sigma$ is an $(n-2,k-2)$ partial derangement and $l$ is an integer 
an integer in $[k-1]$ . If the partial derangement does not contain $n$ then $\hat{\sigma}$ is $\sigma$ with the last element removed and $l$ is the last element.  If
the partial permutation contains $n$ but not in the position indexed by
the last element, then $\hat{\sigma}$ is $\sigma$ with the last element removed and $n$ replaced with the last element, and $l$ is the last element.
Otherwise, $l$ is the last element, and $\sigma(l)=n$ , and we get $\hat{\sigma}$ by removing both $n$ and the last element and decrementing all values greater than $l$ by 1. For example, if $n=5$ and $k=3$ $$4312\Leftrightarrow (431,2)$$ $$4351\Leftrightarrow (431,1)$$ $$4512\Leftrightarrow (31,2)$$ It is not hard to see that all of these operations are reversible, and so the given operation is a bijection. To see that the second recurrence $$(n-k) d_{n,k} = d_{n,k+1} + d_{n-1,k}$$ holds for partial derangements, we describe a bijection that takes a pair consisting of an $(n,k)$ partial derangement $\sigma$ and an integer $l$ not occurring in $\sigma$ (there are $n-k$ possibilities for $l$ ) and constructs either an $(n,k+1)$ partial derangement, or an $(n-1,k)$ partial derangement $\hat\sigma$ . If $l \ne k+1$ then $\hat\sigma$ is obtained by appending $l$ to $\sigma$ giving a valid partial permutation.  Otherwise, let $\hat\sigma$ be
the partial derangement obtained by subtracting 1 from all the elements of $\sigma$ greater than $k+1$ .  Again, it is not hard to see that this gives a bijection.  This seems like it should be an easy argument to transform to the same recurrence for good partial permutations, but I'm not seeing it.","['derangements', 'combinatorics']"

862870,The definition of the sample standard deviation,"I am reviewing the statistic. 
I read the book ""Probability and Statistical Inference""
which is written by Robert V. Hogg and Ellit A. Tanis. There is a statement in the book says that:
(Section: The Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation)
The sample standard deviation, 
$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\geq 0,$$ 
is a measure of how dispersed the data are from the sample mean.
At this stage of your study of statistics, 
it is difficult to get a good understanding or meaning of the standard deviation $s$,
but you can roughly think of it as the average distance of the values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
from the mean $\bar{x}$.
This is not true exactly, 
for, in general, 
$$ s > \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i-\bar{x}|, $$
but it is fair to say that $s$ is somewhat larger, 
yet of the same magnitude, 
as the average of the distances of $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ from $\bar{x}$. Question 1: What book could provide a ""good understanding or meaning"" of the standard deviation for me. Question 2: Why don't we define the sample standard deviation as the 
average distance of the values $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$

It is also known that the similar infinite nested radical $$\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\cdots}}}}$$ converges to $\displaystyle\frac{1}{t_3-1}=1.19148...$, where $t_3=1.83929...$ is the tribonacci constant, corresponding to the ratio  to which adjacent tribonacci numbers tend. Note the similarities with the previous case, since $\displaystyle\frac{1}{\phi-1}=\phi$. Interestingly, assuming that the degree of the radicals is $n$ and that the constant term under the radicals is $1/(n-1)$, the relationship between this type of nested radicals and the n-bonacci constants is valid even for the degenerate 1-bonacci numbers (whose sequence reduces to a series of 1). In this case, the radicals are canceled out, the constant term becomes $1/0=\infty$, and the result is $\infty$, which is in accordance with $\frac{1}{1-1}=\infty$. Based on these considerations, it could be hypothesized that similar nested radicals may exist for higher order n-bonacci numbers. For example, for $n=4$, we could expect that a nested radical giving $\displaystyle\frac{1}{t_4-1}=1.07809...$, where $t_4=1.92756...$ is the so-called tetranacci constant (limit of the ratio between adjacent 4-bonacci numbers), might be $$\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}+\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}+\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}+\sqrt[4]{\frac{1}{3}+\cdots}}}}$$ Unfortunately, in this case the radical seems not to work (it gives $1.09279...$ instead of the expected $1.07809...$). Also, I was not able to find any rational number that, inserted in this nested radical as the constant term, satisfies the equivalence (the numerical value that works is $k=0.27282...$).

863380,A rigorous statement and proof of the two-path test,"Background In multivariable calculus/complex analysis, one often tries to show that a limit doesn't exist by finding two paths which yield different limits. The justification goes that if the limit exists, it must be the same along any path; hence if it is not, it doesn't exist. On an intuitive level, I think I understand this concept. But I have never seen a rigorous justification for this method, nor what exactly constitutes a ""path"". Attempt at a solution Definition/Theorem I'm going to stick to $\mathbb{R}^2$ here, since the arguments should generalize easily. Let $f: U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function defined on the domain $U$ , an open proper subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ . Let us define a ""path"" in this context to be a continuous function $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^2$ , parameterized by $t$ . Suppose that $\lim\limits_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{x_0}} f(\mathbf{x_0})$ exists. Then, for any path $\gamma$ with range in $U$ and $\gamma(t_0) = \mathbf{x_0}$ , $$\lim\limits_{t \to t_0} f(\gamma(t_0)) = L. $$ In terms of $\delta$ 's and $\epsilon$ 's, this says that for any $\epsilon > 0$ , there exists some $\delta > 0$ such that $$\left|t - t_0 \right| < \delta \Rightarrow \left| f(\gamma(t)) - f(\gamma(t_0)) \right| < \epsilon. $$ Proof I don't know how to prove this. Example To demonstrate, I will show that the limit in example (d) from Paul Dawkins' Calculus III notes doesn't exist. I'll follow his proof, exchanging his intuitive definition with the formal one above. To show: $\lim\limits_{(x, y) \to (0, 0)} \frac{x^3y}{x^6 + x^2}$ doesn't exist. Proof : Suppose that the limit exists and is equal to $L$ . First, take the continuous path $\gamma(t) = (t, t)$ (the path $y = x$ ). By our theorem, we conclude that $$\lim\limits_{t \to 0} \frac{t^3t}{t^6 + t^2} = \lim\limits_{t \to 0} \frac{1}{t^2 + 1} = 0 = L.$$ But instead take the path $\gamma(t) = (t, t^3)$ (the path $y = x^3$ ). By our theorem, we conclude that this is also equal to $L = 0$ , but we have $$\lim\limits_{t \to 0} \frac{t^3(t^3)}{t^6 + (t^3)^2} = \lim\limits_{t \to 0} \frac{t^6}{2t^6} = \frac{1}{2},$$ which is a contradiction. Thus, the limit does not exist. Summary So the definition seems to work. My questions are (1) is the definition/theorem I've stated above in terms of continuous paths the most general one and (2) how can we prove it?","['multivariable-calculus', 'limits']"

a. It does not consist of isolated points.
b. It also does not contain any segments of nonzero length.
(a) and (b) seem to me incompatible with each other. I don’t see what the third alternative could be. Longer version: Here is what seems to me the case: At the end of the process, there are aleph-null pieces of the stick left. This must be so, since the cuts only occurred at locations with rational coordinates (calling one endpoint of the stick “0” and the other end “1”). So there are aleph-null cuts, so there must be only aleph-null pieces. Each piece has a size of zero. This must be so, since the measure of the stuff removed is 1, so the total measure of the Dust is 0. If a piece has a size of zero, it’s a point. Imagine overlaying one of the pieces of Cantor Dust on top of a geometric point. How far would it stick out? Zero distance. Therefore, the piece would coincide with the point, and therefore the piece itself is just a point. Therefore, the Cantor set consists of aleph-null points. (From 1-3.) But I also read that the Cantor set contains uncountably many points. What has gone wrong here? In the sources I looked at, no one addresses the ""long version” argument above. None even address the ""short version"", which surprises me. Amendment: I intend ""pieces"" to be the largest connected parts that are left (so a piece might be a single point).

Ideally someone will be able to help me understand where this bound comes from and how it is derived. Here is the idea: Let $M = \left\{\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,\theta_m\right\}$ be a set of ""models"". Additionally, let $\phi : \mathbb{R}^{n\times m} \to \left\{1,2,\ldots,m\right\}$. Indeed, $\phi\left(X^n\right)\in \left\{1,2,\ldots,m\right\}$ where $X^n$ may be thought of as a data (or design) matrix of $n$ observations. In other words, we are trying to recover, through the estimator $\phi$ one of the $m$ models which best describes our data. I am interested in the following quantity: $I\left(\phi; X^n\right)$, where $I$ represents the mutual information. Then the following bounds $I$ from above:
$$
I\left(\phi,X^n\right) \leq \frac{n}{m^2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j = 1}^m S\left(\mathbb{P}_{\theta_i} \left|\right| \mathbb{P}_{\theta_j}\right) 
$$
Here, $S\left(\cdot\left|\right|\cdot\right)$ denotes the symmetric KL-divergence. Further, $\mathbb{P}_{\theta_i}$ represents the underlying probability distribution for the model $\theta_i$. This bound appears in Exploiting the Limits of Structure Learning via Inherent Symmetry and Information-theoretic bounds on model selection for Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds . In the former, see equation (2). In the latter, see equation (18). For the latter paper though, I believe there is a typo as there seems to be a factor of $2n$ missing.

863605,"What would make a function reflexive, transitive, and/or symmetric?","A binary relation $R$ is a subset of the Cartesian product between two sets $X$ and $Y$, containing a set of ordered pairs $\{(x,y) : x \in X, y \in Y\}$. $R$ is a function if each element of $X$ is the first component of at most one ordered pair, injective if each element of $Y$ is the second component of at most one ordered pair, surjective if each element of $Y$ is the second component of at least one ordered pair, and bijective if it is both injective and surjective. Surjectivity and injectivity are independent of functionality; eg, a relation can be surjective and/or injective without being a function, as they are not composite relation types like bijections and equivalence relations. So, can a function also be symmetric, transitive, total and/or reflexive? Would the definitions then, for a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$, be: Symmetric: $f(x) = y \rightarrow f(y) = x$ Transitive: $f(x) = y, f(y) = z \rightarrow f(x) = z$ Total: $f(x) = y \lor f(y) = x$ Reflexive: $f(x) = x$ Intuitively, the identity function $f(x) = x$ is all of these, $f(x) = -x$ is total and symmetric, no injection is transitive, no function is transitive if $x \neq y \neq z$, and every surjective function is total, but are there others? Is there an arithmetic function between numbers that's symmetric, or that's transitive, or both? If so, what is it (or are they) and if not, why not?","['relations', 'elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

863636,Questions about Proof of Lusin's Theorem,"I am reviewing my analysis notes, and having trouble understanding certain parts of the proof to Lusin's theorem. $\textbf{Lusin's Theorem}$:
Let $F: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,\infty)$ be a nonnegative, measurable function.  Suppose $\epsilon > 0$.  Then $\exists$ a compact set $K \subseteq [0,1]$ such that $m(K) > 1 - \epsilon$ ($K$ fills out most of $[0,1]$), and a continuous function $g$ on $[0,1]$ such that $g(x) = f(x)$ if $x \in K$. Here is the proof given in class: First, find a sequence of simple functions $s_{n}$, such that $\lim \limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_{n}(x) = F(x)$ for all $x \in [0,1]$.  Choose $E_{n}$ measurable such that $m(E_{n}) \leq \epsilon*2^{-n-2}$, and continuous functions $f_{n}$ such that $f_{n}(x) = s_{n}(x)$ for $x \in [0,1] \setminus E_{n}$. First question: I know we can find a continuous function that is nearly equal to the characteristic function of a measurable set, and each simple function $s_{n}(x)$ is the sum of characteristic functions, but why does that mean I can find a continuous function nearly equal to the sum of simple functions?  Is it because the sum of the continuous functions for each characteristic function is itself continuous? Now we let $Y = \bigcup \limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} E_{n}$.  Then $m(Y) \leq \frac{\epsilon}{4}$, and $f_{n}(x) = s_{n}(x)$ if $x \in [0,1] \setminus Y$.  This means $\lim \limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{n}(x) = \lim \limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_{n}(x) = F(x)$ if $x \in [0,1] \setminus Y$. Using Egoroff's theorem , we can find a set $Z \subseteq [0,1] \setminus Y$ such that $s_{n} \rightarrow F$ uniformly on $Z$, and consequently, $f_{n} \rightarrow F$ uniformly on $Z$. Second question: Uniform convergence of a sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit, so doesn't this mean $F$ is continuous on $Z$?  My professor does something strange by saying $\exists$ a continuous function $G : Z \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ such that $G(x) = F(x)$ for all $x \in Z$ , which has confused me.  Where did $G$ come from, and why does its codomain not include $\infty$?  What if $F$ did equal $\infty$ on some part of $Z$? Finally, we find a compact set $K \subseteq Z$ such that $m(K) > 1 - \epsilon$, and extend $G\mid_{k}$ to a continuous function on $[0,1]$ by letting the extension be linear on the complementary intervals in $[0,1] \setminus K$. Third question: What complementary intervals of $[0,1] \setminus K$?","['proof-writing', 'analysis']"

863662,Need function for 2D sigmoid-shaped monotonic Surface,"I am looking for a 2D function, $f(x, y)$ which increases monotonically over the range $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ .  In other words, it will be $0$ at $(0,0)$ and $1$ at $(1,1)$ .  It will also evaluate to $0$ whenever $x = 0$ or $y = 0$ .  It's monotonic in the sense that the value at $(0.5,0.6)$ will be greater than at $(0.5, 0.5)$ .  The closest guess that I have to the function that I am looking for is: Plot3D[1/((1+e^(-x*y))),{x,0,1},{y,0,1}] But I would also like to be able to ""bias"" or make the function rise faster with $x$ relative to $y$ or vice-versa.  Ideally, I would like to specify the surface with 2 variables.  One that controls / scales how $f(x,y)$ rises relative to $x$ , and another that controls / scales how $f(x,y)$ rises relative to $y$ . Edit: I am looking for a sigmoid-shaped curve.  The function does not need to be exactly equal to 1 at $z(1,1)$ . However, $z(1,1)$ needs to be higher than any other $z(x,y)$ across the space $x[0:1], y[0:1]$ .  A closer function than the one above is: $$z=1/\left(1+e^{-(x^a*y^b)}\right),$$ where $a$ and $b$ are used to ""bias"" or change the slope of the curve with respect to $x$ vs. $y$ .  However, that curve is close to 1 at $z(2,2)$ instead of $z(1,1)$ .  So $x$ and $y$ need to be scaled.  Those scaling factors will be a function of $a$ and $b$ .  They cannot be computed directly since the exponent needs to be 0 to satisfy the equation exactly.   However, if the exponent evaluates to a sufficiently small number, such as $0.01$ , that should be close enough for my purposes.","['surfaces', 'functions']"

My understanding of these operations is that they are tools that allow one to decompose complicated derivatives in various pieces so one can derive the simplest derivatives one by one. I've tried the following: Using the chain rule, I guess that I should differentiate $e^{\tan (t)}$ first, the derivative of $f(x)=e^x$ is $f'(x)=e^x$ , but I got confused at  how to proceed later, I've differentiated part of the $\tan x$ in a similar fashion to this . At the moment, my guess is that I should finishing doing the derivative of $\tan (x)$ , which is $\sec ^2(x)$ then apply the chain rule, obtaining: $$e^{\tan (t)}\sec^2(t)$$ Now I guess I should use the product's rule to multiply $t$ by $e^{\tan (t)}\sec^2(t)$ , obtaining: $$1 \cdot e^{\tan (t)}+t\cdot e^{\tan (t)}\sec^2(t)$$ And now I guess I should use the quotient rule on: $$\frac{1 \cdot e^{\tan (t)}+t\cdot e^{\tan (t)}\sec^2(t)}{\ln(3t+1)}$$ But I feel this is getting too lengthy and that perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$. For $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$ let $\mu_\alpha(n)$ be the sum of the indices of the at most $\alpha$ many highest non-zero digits of $n$ in its $q$-adic representation, where the indices begin with 1. For example $\mu_2(0)=0$, $\mu_2(1)=1$, $\mu_2(42)=10$, $\mu_2(5)=4$, $\mu_2(8)=4$. Let $\mu_\infty(n)$ be the sum of the indices of all the non-zero digits of $n$. I have ""strong"" numerical evidence that for $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$, it holds that $$\sum_k q^{-\mu_\infty(k)} = (q-1)^n \sum_{a_1 > \dots > a_n \geq 1} q^{-a_1-\dots-a_n} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{fac}_q(n)},$$ where the sum is taken over all $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ with precisely $n$ many non-zero digits, and that $$\sum_k q^{-\mu_\alpha(k)} = (q-1)^\alpha \sum_{a_1 > \dots > a_\alpha \geq 1} q^{-a_1-\dots-a_\alpha} q^{a_\alpha-1} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{fac}_q(\alpha)-\mathrm{fac}_q(\alpha-1)},$$ where the sum is taken over all $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$ with at least $\alpha$ many non-zero digits. Taken together, this means that $$\sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}_0} q^{-\mu_\alpha(k)} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{fac}_q(0)} + \dots + \frac{1}{\mathrm{fac}_q(\alpha-1)} + \frac{1}{\mathrm{fac}_q(\alpha)-\mathrm{fac}_q(\alpha-1)}.$$ My question is whether a (combinatorial?) proof of this equation is known, assuming that it's true.

863833,Convergence of measures — revisited,"In this thread , I asked a question about the convergence of measures. The conjecture I posed there, which turned out to be false, was supposed to be a lemma that I wanted to use to prove a proposition, outlined as follows. Consider the measurable space $(\mathbb R,\mathscr B_{\mathbb R})$. Suppose that $\{\mu_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of finite Radon measures and $\mu$ is a finite Radon measure on $\mathbb R$. Suppose also that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\mu_n(\mathbb R)=\mu(\mathbb R)\tag{1}$$
and that $\{\mu_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ converges to $\mu$ vaguely, in the sense that $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\int f\,\mathrm d\mu_n=\int f\,\mathrm d\mu$$

Your thoughts are much appreciated. Proof:$\quad$ Let $a\in\mathbb R$ and $\varepsilon>0$ be given. Also, fix $\delta>0$. Since $\mu$ is a finite Radon measure, there exists a compact set $C\subset\mathbb R$ such that $$\mu(\mathbb R)\geq\mu(C)>\mu(\mathbb R)-\frac{\delta}{5}.$$ Since compact sets are bounded, one can choose $K>0$ so large that $$-K<a<a+\varepsilon<K,$$ $C\subseteq[-K,K]$, and $$\mu(\mathbb R)\geq\mu([-K,K])>\mu(\mathbb R)-\frac{\delta}{5}.\tag{2}$$ Pick any $L>K$. Clearly, $[-K,K]\subseteq[-L,L]$. Construct a continuous function $h$ such that $h$ is 1 on $[-K,K]$, it vanishes outside $[-L,L]$, and it is linear on $[-L,-K]$ and on $[K,L]$. Then, $h\in C_c$. By vague convergence, there exists some $N_1\in\mathbb N$ such that $$\int h\,\mathrm d\mu<\int h\,\mathrm d\mu_n+\frac{2\delta}{5}\quad\forall n\geq N_1.\tag{3}$$ Also, by (1), there exists some $N_2\in\mathbb N$ such that $$\mu(\mathbb R)+\frac{\delta}{5}>\mu_n(\mathbb R)>\mu(\mathbb R)-\frac{\delta}{5}\quad\forall n\geq N_2\tag{4}.$$ Now, if $n\geq\max\{N_1,N_2\}$, then, on the one hand,
\begin{align*}\mu([-K,K])=&\,\int_{[-K,K]}h\,\mathrm d\mu\leq\int h\,\mathrm d\mu<\int h\,\mathrm d\mu_n+\frac{2\delta}5\\=&\,\int_{[-L,L]}h\,\mathrm d\mu_n+\frac{2\delta}5\leq\mu_n([-L,L])+\frac{2\delta}5;\end{align*}
and, on the other hand,
$$\mu_n([-L,L])\leq\mu_n(\mathbb R)<\mu(\mathbb R)+\frac{\delta}{5}<\mu([-K,K])+\frac{2\delta}{5},$$
by (2) and (4). Therefore,
$$\mu_n([-L,L])-\frac{2\delta}{5}<\mu([-K,K])<\mu_n([-L,L])+\frac{2\delta}{5}\quad\forall n\geq\max\{N_1,N_2\}\tag{5}.$$ Let $M>L$ be arbitrary. Construct a continuous function $g$ such that $g$ is 1 on $[-L,a]$, it vanishes outside $[-M,a+\varepsilon]$, and it is linear on $[-M,-L]$ and on $[a,a+\varepsilon]$. Then, $g\in C_c$. By vague convergence, there exists some $N_3\in\mathbb N$ such that $$\int g\,\mathrm d\mu_n<\int g\,\mathrm d\mu+\frac{\delta}{5}\quad\forall n\geq N_3.\tag{6}$$ Let $n\geq N^*\equiv\max\{N_1,N_2,N_3\}$. Then,
\begin{align*}
F_n(a)=&\,\mu_n((-\infty,a])=\mu_n((-\infty,-L))+\mu_n([-L,a])\\
=&\,\mu_n(\mathbb R)-\mu_n([-L,L])-\mu_n((L,\infty))+\mu_n([-L,a])\\

\underbrace{<}_{(2)}&\,\frac{4\delta}5+\mu_n([-L,a])=\int_{[-L,a]}g\,\mathrm d\mu_n+\frac{4\delta}{5}\\
\leq&\,\int g\,\mathrm d\mu_n+\frac{4\delta}{5}\underbrace{<}_{(6)}\int g\,\mathrm d\mu+\delta=\int_{[-M,a+\varepsilon]}g\,\mathrm d\mu+\delta\\
\leq&\,\mu([-M,a+\varepsilon])+\delta\leq\mu((-\infty,a+\varepsilon])+\delta=F(a+\varepsilon)+\delta.
\end{align*} Since this is true for all $n\geq N^*$, it follows that
$$\limsup_{n\to\infty} F_n(a)=\inf_{k\in\mathbb N}\sup_{n\geq k}F_n(a)\leq \sup_{n\geq N^*}F_n(a)\leq F(a+\varepsilon)+\delta.$$
Given that $\delta>0$ can be made arbitrarily small, the claim follows. $\blacksquare$ Note: this proposition is needed to prove Proposition 7.19(b) in Folland (1999) .

\end{align*} Hence, it seems that we can solve this integral by recursive relation $\text{(1)}$, but how to get a accurate result about the integral.","['definite-integrals', 'improper-integrals', 'integration']"
863914,Completion of Complex Numbers,"In some way, $\mathbb{C}$ completes $\mathbb{R}$, why is there nothing that completes $\mathbb{C}$? Is it just more so that we don't want anything more than $\mathbb{C}$, or is there a property of $\mathbb{C}$ that makes it complete , in some sense? I know algebraically $\mathbb{C}$ is very nice, but is there nothing else we look for?",['complex-analysis']
863959,Fermat's Last Theorem for Negative $n$,"While studying Fermat's Last Theorem and Pythagorean triples, the following question occurred to me: 
For the equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$, where $n$ is a negative integer, a) does a solution exist, and b) if solutions exist, is there some analog to Fermat's Last Theorem for these parameters?  I have made a few passing attempts at finding a solution and have come up empty handed, though I am no great mathematical mind and would not be shocked if I have missed even obvious answers.  Thank you in advance for your aid.","['algebra-precalculus', 'pythagorean-triples', 'number-theory']"
863960,Orientation of hypersurface,"Some books on mean curvature flow (e.g. Mantegazza, Ecker) state that an embedded hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ is orientable (Mantegazza page 3, Ecker page 110).  In other words, they assume the existence of a globally defined (unit) normal field along the embedded hypersurface. Does anyone know how to prove this?  Isn't the Mobius strip able to be embedded in Euclidean space, yet it isn't orientable? For some definitions, let $M$ be a smooth $k$-dimensional manifold.  A smooth map $\varphi:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ is a hypersurface (an immersion ) if its differential is injective.  It is an embedding if it is also a homeomorphism onto its image $\varphi(M)$.  An immersed hypersurface is a subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ which is a $k$-dimensional manifold such that the inclusion map $\iota:S\hookrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ is an immersion.  An embedded hypersurface is a subset $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ which is a $k$-dimensional manifold whose topology conicides with the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ and the inclusion is an embedding. We can also characterise an embedded hypersurface using single-slice adapted charts: Each point $p\in S$ is contained in a coordinate neighborhood of a single-slice chart $(U,\mathsf{u})$ on $\mathbb{R}^{k+1}$ adapted to $S$ such that $U\cap S=\{(u^1,...,u^{k+1})\;|\;u^{k+1}=0\}$.  The pair $(U\cap S,\mathsf{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^k}\circ\mathsf{u}|_{U\cap S})$ is then a chart for $S$ and as we range over $p\in S$ we get an atlas for $S$.","['differential-topology', 'manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

864031,Computing values of centralizers in a non-solvable group with a given property,"A finite group G satisfies property $P_n$ if for every prime integer $p$, $G$ has at most $(n−1)$ non-central conjugacy classes the order of the representative element of which is a multiple of $p$. Let $G$ be a non-solvable group satisfying property $P_5$. Also suppose that $N$ be an abelian $p$-group of order $p^r$ with $p\notin \pi(G/N)$ and $N=C_G(N)$. Let $K=G/N\cong A_5$, $Y< K$ be a Frobenius group of order 12‎, ‎$x\in Y$ of order 3 and $P$ a Sylow 2-subgroup of $Y$‎. Then we conclude that $p, 2p, 3p \in \pi_e(G)$ and since $G$ satisfies in property $P_5$, it follows that $G$ has at most two class of elements of order 3p. Clearly all elements of order $3$ lie in one class. Suppose that $y$ and $z$ are elements of order $3p$. The question is whether $P$ acts fixed point freely on $N$ and how the values of $|C_N(x)|, |C_G(x)|$,  $|C_G(y)|$ and $|C_G(z)|$ be computed?","['permutations', 'representation-theory', 'sylow-theory', 'finite-groups', 'group-theory']"
