2085335,Finite summation over reciprocal of binomial coefficient,"Problem : Simplify
$$ \sum_{m=0}^k a^m m! (n-m)!$$ 
where $a$ is real and positive, $k \in \mathbb N$ and $n \in \mathbb N$ with $k \leq n$. Upper bounds and lower bounds may also be useful. One example I have found  is, assuming $a \neq 1$ and using $m! (n-m)! \leq n!$, 
$$ \sum_{m=0}^k a^m m!(n-m)! \leq n! \sum_{m=0}^k a^m = \frac{n! \left(1 - a^{k+1} \right)}{1-a},$$
but I am not satisfied with the accuracy of this bound. I am aware of the somewhat related math.stackexchange.com question: Calculate $\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{{2k \choose k}}$","['combinatorics', 'binomial-coefficients']"

2085347,Linear objective function with quadratic constraints,"The context is ordinary multivariate regression with $k$ (>1) regressors, i.e. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, where
$Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ vector of predicted variable,
$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (k+1)}$ matrix of regressor variables(including ones in the first column) 
$\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{(k+1) \times 1}$ vector of coefficients, including intercept. Say, I have already estimated $\beta$ as $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'Y.$ I have to solve the following program: minimize $f(B) = L\beta$   ( $L$ is a fixed $1\times (k+1)-$vector   )
such that:
$[(\beta-\hat{\beta})' \cdot X'X \cdot (\beta-\hat{\beta})] / [(Y - X\hat{\beta})' (Y - X\hat{\beta}) ]$   is less than a given value $c$. Note that this is a linear optimization program with respect to $\beta$ with quadratic constraints. I don't understand how we can solve this optimization - I was going through some online resources, each of which involve manually computing gradients of the objective as well as constraint functions - which I want to avoid (at least manually doing this). Can you please help solve this optimization problem in R ? The inputs would be:
$X$, $Y$,
$\hat{\beta}$,
$L$ and
$c$ Please let me know if any further information is required - the set-up is pretty general.","['regression', 'optimization', 'qclp', 'statistics', 'convex-optimization']"

2085375,Why does multiplication act like scaling and rotation of a vector in the complex plane? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : Geometric interpretation of the multiplication of complex numbers? (3 answers) Closed 7 years ago . I regularly use the geometric analogy of multiplication by a complex number to represent a scaling and rotation of a vector in the complex plane. For a very simple example, i would point up along the Y axis and multiplying it by i again would be a 90 degree rotation resulting in something pointing in the -X direction. The thing is, I no longer recall why this is true. It's not obvious to me any longer why multiplication is in any way connected to rotation (scaling seems fairly obvious) and I was unable to explain the logic behind this useful trick to a friend who asked why it worked. Could I get a very clear explanation of this geometric interpretation of multiplication by complex numbers? I feel like it had to do with Euler's identity and the polar form of complex numbers but this math is quite a few years behind me.","['arithmetic', 'complex-numbers', 'geometric-interpretation', 'geometry']"

2085401,If $a_n = \frac{1}{2} (a_{n-1}+a_{n-2})$ prove $a_n=2+4 \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^n$ for $n \geq 2$,"Question: Let $a_1=0, a_2=3$, and, for all $n \geq 3$ let $a_n = \frac{1}{2} (a_{n-1}+a_{n-2})$ The sequence $(a_n)$ is said to be defined recursively. on $n$, show that, for all $n \geq 2$, $$a_n=2+4 \left(\frac{-1}{2}\right)^n$$ And deduce that $(a_n) \rightarrow 2$ My attempt: $
  a_1 = 0 , a_2 = 3 , \ldots
$ $\forall n \geq 3$ let $a_n = \frac{1}{2}(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2})$ Show inductively that $\forall n \geq 2$ $
  a_n = 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^n
$ And deduce that $(a_n) \rightarrow 2$ So $\ldots$ let $n$ = $3$ then $a_3 = \frac{1}{2}(a_2 + a_{1}) = \frac{1}{2}(3 + 0) = \frac{3}{2}$ This is equal to $2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^3$, so this holds. Assume that this holds up to $n = k$, then for $n = k + 1$; $a_{k + 1} = \frac{1}{2}(a_k + a_{k-1})$ $a_k$ is known as $a_k = 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^k$ And $a_{k - 1}$ is also known as $a_{k - 1}= 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1}$ so I then have $2a_{k+1} = (a_k + a_{k-1})$, and subbing in the values above for $a_k$ and
$a_{k-1}$ gives $2a_{k+1} = ((2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^k) + (2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1}))$ Which can be simplified to $a_{k+1} = (1 + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k + 1 + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1})$ and $a_{k+1} = 2 + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1}$ Using exponent laws for $ 2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1}$ gives \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k - 1} &= 2(-\frac{1}{2})^{k} \times (- \frac{1}{2})^{-1} \\
    &= 2(-\frac{1}{2})^{k} \times (-2) \\
    &= -4(-\frac{1}{2})^{k} \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} Subbing this back into $a_{k+1} = 2 + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k -
  1}$  as \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    a_{k+1} &= 2 + 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k -4(-\frac{1}{2})^{k} \\
    &= 2 - 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} If the induction holds then $ a_{k + 1} =  2 - 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k = 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k + 1}$ Using power laws on $ 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k + 1}$ gives \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k + 1} &= 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k } \times (- \frac{1}{2})^{1} \\
    &= 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k } \times (- \frac{1}{2}) \\
    &= -2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k }  \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} Using this result gives \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    a_{k + 1} &=  2 - 2(- \frac{1}{2})^k \\
    &= 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^{k + 1} \\
    &= 2  -2(- \frac{1}{2})^{k }  \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} As required. Therefore by the inductive hypothesis $\forall n \geq 2, a_n = 2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^n $ Deduce that $(a_n) \rightarrow 2$ If $(a_n) \rightarrow 2$ then as $n \rightarrow \infty, a_n \rightarrow 2$.
So the limit of the sequence is $2$. Using the definition of convergence: $\forall \epsilon > 0$ there exist natural numbers $N,n$ where $n>N$ such that
$|2 + 4(- \frac{1}{2})^n - 2| < \epsilon$ Which simplifies to $|4(- \frac{1}{2})^n| < \epsilon$ and $4(\frac{1}{2})^n <
\epsilon$ Then, given $\epsilon > 0$ choose $N$ such that the minimum value of $N$ is
$\log_2(\frac{4}{\epsilon})$ such that for all $n > N, a_n < \epsilon$ This can be seen as \begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    N &> \log_2(\frac{4}{\epsilon}) \\
    2^N &> \frac{4}{\epsilon} \\
    \frac{1}{2^N}  &< \frac{\epsilon}{4} \\
    \frac{4}{2^N}  &< \epsilon \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*} As required. This proves that $a_n \rightarrow 2$ Not sure if this is correct but could someone please check and if there is an easier way of proving this let me know!","['induction', 'convergence-divergence', 'sequences-and-series', 'proof-verification']"

To try to make this rigorous, I argued that when $u\pm\Delta u$ is in the first quadrant, that we have the following geometrically obtained bounds: $$\frac{\sin(u+\Delta u)-\sin(u)}{\Delta u}<\cos(u)<\frac{\sin(u-\Delta u)-\sin(u)}{-\Delta u}$$ where $\Delta u>0$.

2085487,Some question regarding how probability is defined,"Consider an arbitrary discrete probability distribution with sample space $\Omega$ and let $\omega\subset\Omega$. Let $n$ denote the amount of independent trials of an experiment that are performed and let $\operatorname{f}(n)$ equal the amount of times $\omega$ occurs during those $n$ trials. It is my understanding that  $\operatorname{P}(\omega)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{f}(n)/n$. Is $\operatorname{f}$ essentially ""pure randomness""? I mean we can't necessarily be certain about what value we acquire from $\operatorname{f}$ when evaluated at $n$. I'm used to a function giving me the same number when I iteratively evaluate it at the same number, but this isn't the case now is it? Does it make sense for $\operatorname{f}$ to exist philosophically? If ""pure randomness"" determines the value of $\operatorname{f}(n)$ in the sense that we can never be $100$% certain about we value it will yield, how do we define ""pure randomness""? Since $\operatorname{f}$ is not a normal function like those in calculus, how do we define the convergence of $\operatorname{P}(\omega)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{f}(n)/n$? Does the $\delta$-$\epsilon$ kind of definition apply here as well? How rigorous is this definition generally speaking?

2085541,Is $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2^nx)}{2^n}$ continuous? or differentiable anywhere?,"Does it make sense to call $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2^nx)}{2^n}$ continuous? For any finite n it is easy to declare that the function is continuous. Now when we let $n \to \infty$ we get a function that would seem pretty continuous, with each value very very close to its neighbors. However when we attempt to take the derivative anywhere on the function (except for a few key points) we find due the infinitesimal and ever present oscillations inherent in the function it doesn't really make sense to take the derivative. My hunch is to say that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(2^nx)}{2^n}$ is continuous but not differentiable. But how can one justify that? PS: if you want to see an interactive, zoomable version of the function PPS:
Could the function possibly be differentiable at $f(2\pi k)$ for $k =$ some integer. At $2\pi k $ the derivative of $ \frac{\sin(2^nx)}{2^n}$ is $\frac{1}{2^n}$ for all n. Does that imply diferentiablitity at $2 \pi k$?","['derivatives', 'fourier-series', 'continuity']"

Here my question is: There are identities which fails on some branches of logarithm. Is there any way to determine the region for which these familiar identities valid using Branch points and Branch cuts?

Similarly, $\int g(x)dx$ should have units of $type(x)$ over $type(a)$, which indeed it does (since we defined $x$ & $c$ to have the same units, and $a$ and $b$ to have the same units), but it also involves a non-dimensionless argument to $\ln$.

When I first watched numberphile's 1+2+3+... = $\frac{-1}{12}$ I thought the sum actually equalled $\frac{-1}{12}$ without really understanding it. Recently I read some wolframalpha pages and watched some videos and now I understand (I think), that $\frac{-1}{12}$ is just an associative value to the sum of all natural numbers when you analytically continue the riemann-zeta function. 3Blue1Brown's video really helped. What I don't really understand is why it gives the value $\frac{-1}{12}$ specifically. The value $\frac{-1}{12}$ seems arbitrary to me and I don't see any connection to the sum of all natural numbers. Is there any intuition behind why you get $\frac{-1}{12}$ when analytically continue the zeta function at $\zeta(-1)$? EDIT (just to make my question a little clearer):
I'll use an example here. Suppose you somehow didn't know about radians and never associated trig functions like sine to $\pi$ but you knew about maclaurin expansion. By plugging in x=$\pi$ to the series expansion of sine, you would get sine($\pi$) = 0. You might have understood the process in which you get the value 0, the maclaurin expansion, but you wouldn't really know the intuition behind this connection between $\pi$ and trig functions, namely the unit circle, which is essential in almost every branch of number theory. Back to this question, I understand the analytic continuation of the zeta function and its continued form for $s < 0$ $$\zeta(s)=2^s\pi^{s-1}\sin\frac{\pi s}2\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s)$$ and how when you plug in s = -1, things simplify down to $\frac{-1}{12}$ but I don't see any connection between the fraction and the infinite sum. I'm sure there is a beautiful connection between them, like the one between trig functions and $\pi$, but couldn't find any useful resources on the internet.

2086051,"Proof of Karlin-Rubin's theorem, detail about a real analysis fact.","Although the setting of this question is statistics, the question actually asks for a real analysis fact (monotone functions). Karlin-Rubin's theorem states conditions under which we can find a uniformly most powerful test (UMPT) for a statistical hypothesis: Suppose a family of density or mass functions $\{f(\vec{x}|\theta):\,\theta\in\Theta\}$ and we want to test $$\begin{cases} H_0:\,\theta\leq\theta_0 \\ H_A:\,\theta>\theta_0.\end{cases}$$If the likelihood ratio is monotone on a statistic $T(\vec{x})$ (that is, for every fixed $\theta_1<\theta_2$ in $\Theta$, the ratio $\frac{f(\vec{x}|\theta_2)}{f(\vec{x}|\theta_1)}$ is nondecreasing on $\{\vec{x}:\,f(\vec{x}|\theta_2)>0\text{ or }f(\vec{x}|\theta_1)>0\}$ as a function of $T(\vec{x})$), then the test of critical region $\text{CR}=\{\vec{x}:\,T(\vec{x})\geq k\}$, where $k$ is chosen so that $\alpha=P(\text{CR}|\theta=\theta_0)$, is the UMPT of size $\alpha$. In all the proofs I have read (for instance, in page 22 here or in "" Statistical inference "" by Casella-Berger, 2n edition, page 391), it is (more or less) said: ""we can find $k_1$ such that, if $T(\vec{x})\geq k$, then $\frac{f(\vec{x}|\theta_2)}{f(\vec{x}|\theta_1)}\geq k_1$, and if $T(\vec{x})<k$, then  $\frac{f(\vec{x}|\theta_2)}{f(\vec{x}|\theta_1)}< k_1$"". I would understand that statement if the likehood ratio were strictly increasing, but what about the case in which it is constant? For example, if $X\sim U(0,\theta)$, the likelihood ratio is monotone on $T(\vec{x})=\max_{1\leq i\leq n}x_i$ ($n$ is the length of the sample $\vec{x}$), but not strictly increasing. EDIT: My questions are: Is the assertion between quotation marks true for every density or mass function with (not strictly) monotone likelihood ratio on $T$?

If $S(f,\dot{P})$ approaches a definite value $I$ as $||\dot{P}||\to0$, then $$\int f = I$$ By the definition, $\dot{P}$ runs over the set of all tagged partitions of [$a,b]$, taking into account any partitioning and any tagging for that particular partition. Is this much freedom of choice really necessary? From this question , I know that if we specify the choices for both $P$ and $t$, the integral is no longer equivalent to the Riemann integral (In the link, $P$ is always an equipartition, and $t$ is the set of the left endpoints of $P$). What if we fix exactly one of $P,t$? Is the resulting ""integral"" still equivalent to the Riemann integral? For example, if I define another integral $\int_1$ similarly (but specifying choice of $P$): For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ define $P_n$ to be the equipartition of $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals of equal length, and for any tagging $t_{P_n}$ of $P_n$ denote the corresponding tagged partition as $\dot{P}_{n,t}$.

specifying $t$, for example, by taking the mid-points of each subinterval of a given partition. Will this $\int_1$ or $\int_2$ be equivalent to $\int$?

2086670,Proving Lebesgue Integration Yields Same Answer As Riemann,"I am working on extended essay for my International Baccalaureate Programme Full Diploma, and I chose mathematics as my topic.  My research questions is: “What are the shortcomings of Riemann integration, why do they exist, and how do other forms of integration overcome those limitations?” The first alternative I will discuss is Lebesgue integration.  By starting with a graphical analysis of a bijective function $f\left( x\right)$ whose limit will be evaluated from $x=a$ to $x=b$, I have attempted to write the process as a unified equation, $$L=\small\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\left[ f^{-1}\left( a+i\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)-f^{-1}\left( a+\left[ i-1\right]\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)\right]\left( a+i\left[\dfrac{f\left( b\right) -f\left( a\right)}{n}\right]\right)\right)$$ By comparison, my formula for Riemann integration follows the form $$R=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f\left( a+\frac{i\left( b-a\right)}{n}\right)\left(\frac{ b-a}{n}\right)$$ I am having extreme difficulty proving that $L=R$, since I do not know how to algebraically evaluate the limit of a series.  However, I did try to test my formulae for $f\left( x\right)=x^2+1$, $a=0$ and $b=a$.  While the formula $R$ has successfully yielded the correct answer under every trial, I have only gotten $L$ to converge to $R$ when integrating symmetrical trigonometric functions; in this case, however, $L$ ended up appearing to be undefined for all $x>0$. Does anyone have any suggestions?  Have I made a key mathematical error? an arithmetical one?

Thus, $M$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$, and so has fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}$. Now consider the fiber bundle $X\subset\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}\times M$ defined as the subspace obtained by removing the points $\{a,b,c\}$ from each fiber $\mathbb{P}^1\times\{(a,b,c)\}$. Thus, $X$ is a fiber bundle over $M$ with fibers which are projective lines minus 3 points. This bundle admits the constant section ""$\infty$"".

$$
\lvert f(x_1)-f(x_2)\rvert\leqslant L\lvert x_1-x_2\rvert.
$$ Despite two little things, I think the proof should work as follows: I think, we can choose some $c\in\mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert c\rvert =1$ such that
$$
\lvert f(x_2)-f(x_1)\rvert = c\cdot (f(x_2)-f(x_1))~~(*)
$$
since for 
$$
\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{\lvert f(x_2)-f(x_1)\rvert}=:v
$$
we have $\lvert v\rvert =1$ and then we can define $c:=v^{-1}$. Next, in order to have equation $(*)$, the LHS has to be the real part of the RHS, i.e.
$$
\lvert f(x_2)-f(x_1)\rvert =\Re(c\cdot (f(x_2)-f(x_1)))=\varphi(x_2)-\varphi(x_1),
$$
where
$$
\varphi:=\Re(cf).
$$ Now, since $f$ is differentiable on $I$, it is, in particular, continuous on $[x_1,x_2]$, hence $\varphi$ is also continuous on $[x_1,x_2]$. I am not sure about the following question: Do we also have that $\varphi$ is differentiable on $(x_1,x_2)$? (Q) Assuming that we can answer question (Q) with YES, we could apply the mean value Theorem on $\varphi$, telling us that 
$$
\varphi(x_2)-\varphi(x_1)=(x_2-x_1)\varphi'(\xi)
$$ 
for some $\xi\in (x_1,x_2)$. By assumption, $\varphi'(\xi)=\Re(cf'(\xi))\leq\lvert cf'(\xi)\rvert\leq L$ and hence
$$
\lvert f(x_2)-f(x_1)\rvert = \varphi(x_2)-\varphi(x_1)=(x_2-x_1)\varphi'(\xi)\leqslant L\lvert x_2-x_1\rvert.
$$ I am also not completely sure if

\varphi' = \Re(cf')

    is correct. Despite the two things in the two yellow boxes, I am pretty sure the proof should work. It would be nice if you could give me some hints.","['derivatives', 'real-analysis', 'continuity']"

Then $\tilde{M}$ is a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules.  If $N$ is another $A$-module, then $\tilde{M} \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \tilde{N}$ is the sheaf associated to the presheaf $$U \mapsto \tilde{M}(U) \otimes_{\mathcal O_X(U)} \tilde{N}(U)$$ which is also a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules.  I'm trying to understand why $$\widetilde{(M \otimes_A N)} \cong \tilde{M} \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \tilde{N}$$ as $\mathcal O_X$-modules.  This is II, 5.2(b) in Hartshorne.  All that is written for the proof is ""$M \mapsto \tilde{M}$ commutes with tensor product, because this commutes with localization"" which I don't understand.

For $U$ open in $X$, let $S(U) = \{ a \in A : a \not\in \mathfrak p \textrm{ for all } \mathfrak p \in U \}$, which is multiplicatively closed.  Then I believe that $\mathcal O_X$ is the sheaf  associated to the presheaf of rings $\alpha: U \mapsto S(U)^{-1}A$, and $\tilde M$ is that associated to the presheaf of abelian groups $\beta: U \mapsto S(U)^{-1}M$. Then $\beta$ is a presheaf of $\alpha$-modules, which induces $\tilde M$ as a sheaf of $\mathcal O_X$-modules.  The same for $\gamma: U \mapsto S(U)^{-1}N$ and $\tilde{N}$.  Now $\delta: U \mapsto \beta(U) \otimes_{\alpha(U)} \gamma(U)$ is a presheaf of abelian groups whose associated sheaf is probably $\tilde{M} \otimes_{\mathcal O_X} \tilde{N}$.  But at the same time, $$\delta(U) = S(U)^{-1}M \otimes_{S(U)^{-1}A} S(U)^{-1}N \cong S(U)^{-1}(M \otimes_A N)$$ and the associated sheaf is $\tilde{M \otimes_A N}$.",['algebraic-geometry']

Take  the stochastic process $X_0 = 0$ and $X_t = \nu t + \sigma W_t$  where $W_t$ is standard Brownian motion and $\nu$ is a drift which may be negative (this is the key complexity to the question) Let $\alpha > 0$ be a fixed level, then define the first passage time as the random variable: $T = \inf\{ 0 < t \mid X_t=\alpha \}$. Finally, define $0 < \bar{T} < \infty$ as a terminal time. I want to compute two things: $\mathbb{P}(T < \bar{T})$ $\mathbb{E}(e^{-r T} | T < \bar{T})$ Solving the $\nu \geq 0$ case: I believe this turns out to be easy as this follows the example in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_Gaussian_distribution#Relationship_with_Brownian_motion .  Hence, $T$ is distributed as an Inverse Gaussian: $T\sim IG(\tfrac\alpha\nu, \tfrac {\alpha^2} {\sigma^2})$ in that notation. Let $f(T;\tfrac\alpha\nu, \tfrac {\alpha^2} {\sigma^2})$ be the PDF and $F(T;\tfrac\alpha\nu, \tfrac {\alpha^2} {\sigma^2})$ be the CDF of the Inverse Gaussian, then we have our simple answer: $$\mathbb{P}(T < \bar{T}) = F(\bar{T})$$ and 
$$\mathbb{E}(e^{-r T} | T < \bar{T}) =  \frac{1}{ F(\bar{T})} \int_0^{\bar{T}}e^{-r T}f(T) dT$$ Of course, to eliminate the use of the PDF we could also write the expectation in terms of the counter-cdf of the right truncated CDF instead of the PDF. Solving the $\nu < 0$ case: As Karlin and Taylor puts it: ""When $\nu < 0$, $T$ has a defective probability distribution, that is $T$ is infinite with positive probability"". For that reason, a PDF cannot be used directly and the CDF would need to be used with care.  But can we use the PDF conditionally, as above, adjusting for the probability of $T$ being infinite?

Show that $\pi$ is injective on points (easy). If $p \in X$ is any point, show that $\pi$ induces an isomorphism of residue ﬁelds $\kappa(\pi(p))\rightarrow \kappa(p)$. Show that $\pi$ induces an injection of tangent spaces. Where here the degree of $\pi$ at $y$ means that dimension of the global sections of $\pi^{-1}(y)$ as a $\kappa(y)$ vector space. I can show that $\pi$ is injective on points, since the fibre over a point is a finite scheme over $\operatorname{Spec}$ of the residue field there and thus a finite, discrete set of points.

Why came to this question: Consider the general linear Lie algebra $L=\mathfrak{gl}(n,F)$; in it, let $T=\mathfrak{t}(n,F)$ be the upper triangular sub-algebra. Then normalizer of $T$ in $L$ is $T$ itslef, and this can be proved just by considering a very simple decomposition of ${\mathfrak gl}(n,F)$: write any element as sum of upper triangular matrix and lower triangular matrix whose diagonal is $0$. But then for problem above, is it necessary to use Bruhat decomposition?","['alternative-proof', 'abstract-algebra', 'group-theory']"

2087085,Books to release our inner Ubermensch with calculus?,"I took calculus courses and have read some books about it. Most of them is similar: There are the definitions and some applications but not enough depth. For example, it is very common to find the problem of the box in calculus books: Having a sheet of paper of area $a^2$ , how can we fold it into a box in a way that maximizes the volume? This is a really interesting problem and I guess that the books could have a little bit more about it, in a way that almost suggests the study of optimization problems. The problem for me is that calculus by itself doesn't seems stimulating enough. But I have found several titles that make calculus more interesting. Take a look at this result from Chen's: Excursions in Classical Analysis. I think this is a very interesting and elegant result! One can have all these means as a function based on simple integrals and as a bonus, you also gain a very easy way to deduce inequalities between all them! I have also found Moll's: Numbers and Functions: From a classical-experimental mathematician’s point of view ; Moll/Boros: Irresistible Integrals: Symbolics, Analysis and Experiments in the Evaluation of Integrals ; Moll's books are filled with the study of polynomials, Riemann's $\zeta$ Function, Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials, Hermite polynomials, $\Gamma$ function, Logarithmic Integrals, etc. Kazarinoff's: Analytic inequalities ; Kazarinoff even makes an appeal in his book: Steele: The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class: An Introduction to the Art of Mathematical Inequalities ; Gardiner's: Infinite processes , also sold by Dover as Understanding Infinite ; Gardiner's book is IMO an excellent choice to explain why we need a more rigorous analysis. Very soon in the book, he already presents some functions in which a naive usage of ideas in calculus can take one to hazardous consequences. Iosevich's: A View from the Top: Analysis, Combinatorics and Number Theory ; Spencer's: Asymptopia ; Shahriari's: Approximately Calculus . Shahriari's book is a real gem. Just take a look at its contents. It has a section on dynamical systems! Sasane's: The how and why of one variable calculus . What I call ""interesting"" here is the suggestion of using calculus to discover neat problems both in analysis and in others areas of mathematics or a decent and organic explanation of the whys. I felt that calculus was no stimulating because the derivative is basically ""a tool for finding lines tangent to functions"" and the integral is basically ""a tool for measuring the are under a curve"" , obviously: These are worthy, but where can we go from there? The question is, do you know more books that complement this list? Behind the scenes: The original title of the question was: ""Where to find books with interesting activities using calculus?"" but MSE suggested a change for a better title. I changed to this and the warning disappeared: If there is no warning, then this is a better title!

EDIT Thank you for putting the question on hold and leaving me without any idea. Now that I have solved it I think it's a quite nice integral and so I'm glad I managed to do it on my own. Here is my solution. Exponent with negative argument in integral from $0$ to $\infty$ reminds us of the gamma function. Recall the definition: $\Gamma(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}x^{s-1}\mathrm{d}x$. In this way the logarithm comes quite naturally as we take derivative of $\Gamma$ using diferentiation under the integral sign. Second power of the $\log$ comes from second derivative of $\Gamma$. The situation is a bit more complicated here, since we have $e$ to the power $x^2$. However this is not a great obstacle - just make the change $x\to\sqrt{x}$. Thus $\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}x^{s-1}\mathrm{d}x=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x}x^{\frac{s-1}{2}}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}\mathrm{d}x=\frac{1}{2}\Gamma(\frac{s}{2})$. Hence $$\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}\log^2 x =\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}s^2}\Big|_{s=1}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-x^2}x^{s-1}\mathrm{d}x=\frac{1}{8}\Gamma''\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).$$
The problem now reduces to finding second derivative of gamma at $\frac{1}{2}$. To find derivatives of $\Gamma$ it is helpful to find derivatives of $\log\Gamma$ - the so-called polygamma function. Representing $\Gamma$ as its Weierstrass factorization and taking $\log$ leads to series which are simple to differentiate and calculate. Recall that $$\Gamma(s)=\frac{e^{-\gamma s}}{s}\prod_{n\ge 1}^{\infty}\left(\left(1+\frac{s}{n}\right)^{-1} e^{s/n}\right).$$ Thus $$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}\log\Gamma(s)=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}\left(-\gamma s-\log s+\sum_{n\ge 1}^{\infty}\left(-\log\left(1+\frac{s}{n}\right)+\frac{s}{n}\right)\right)=-\gamma-\frac{1}{s}+\sum_{n\ge 1}^{\infty}\left(-\frac{1}{n+s}+\frac{1}{n}\right)\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}=-\gamma-2+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n(2n+1)}=-\gamma+\log 4.$$ Now rewrite $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}\log\Gamma(s)=\frac{\Gamma'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
}$. So we have $$\Gamma'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\gamma+\log 4)\ (1).$$
In the same manner we find second derivative of $\log\Gamma$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}s^2}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}\log\Gamma(s)=\frac{1}{s^2}+\sum_{n\ge 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+s)^2}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}=4+4\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{2}.$$
Again we rewrite the derivative as differentiation of composite function - $\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}s^2}\Big|_{s=\frac{1}{2}}\log\Gamma(s)=-\frac{\Gamma'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}+\frac{\Gamma''\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}$. Now, taking into consideration what we previously obtained about the second derivative, the result about the first derivative and the fact $\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\sqrt{\pi}$ we come to equation for the second derivative at $\frac{1}{2}$ which gives us $$\Gamma''\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\left(2\gamma^2+\pi^2+4\gamma \log 4+2\log^2 4\right).$$ Now mupltiply by $8$ and get the final result.","['integration', 'definite-integrals']"
