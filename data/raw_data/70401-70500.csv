858245,Checking some work on differential $y''-4y=\sinh x$,"I want to check that I have done this correctly, because I feel like I am most of he way there but missing something important (or maybe just something obvious that I ought to know) We have the following differential equation: $$y''-4y=\sinh x$$ This should be simple enough, or so I thought. I see the characteristic equation for the linear homogeneous expression ($y''-4y=0$) should be $r^2 - 4 = 0$ so the roots are $r\pm2$. All-righty then, the solution $y_p$ ought to look like this: $y_p = c_1e^{2x}+c_2e^{-2x}$ because both roots are real and distinct. I take derivatives of $y_p$: $$y'_p = 2c_1e^{2x}-2c_2e^{-2x}$$ $$y''_p = 4c_1e^{2x}+4c_2e^{-2x}$$ and plugging it back into the original DE: $\sinh x = 4c_1e^{2x}+4c_2e^{-2x} - 4(c_1e^{2x}+c_2e^{-2x})$ But you can see the problem I end up with zero, and thus can't equate the coefficients of like powers (understand I had planned to just convert sinh into the Euler expression $\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$ and go from there). So, I did something wrong, and it looks like I should have used variation of parameters here, but I admit that technique I am a bit fuzzy on.

However we then end up with another alternating sum of products of these solutions with the binomial coefficients that came out of using the recursion.

858304,Diagonalisation argument for real numbers,"I know that the the set of real numbers has been proved uncountable by mathematicians, so my question is why this is wrong. In countability arguments that I have seen the numbers are laid out in a grid with 1,2,3,4,... as rows and columns and the number at the nth row and mth column is n/m. So what if we have an extra dimension k, that represents the power, so at depth 3 the power is 1/3 so it becomes $ ({\frac{n}{m}})^{(\frac{1}{k})} $. It should be possible to visit every position in the cube by a similar procedure akin to the one used for 2 dimensional grid. Any non fractional power will give another rational number so only 1/k is actually necessary. While this only appears to work for the solution to a polynomial, such solutions are not rational numbers. Which would make some sets of irrational numbers countable, but that doesn't quite make sense to me. So therefore there must be something wrong with my ideas but I don't know what it is.",['elementary-set-theory']
858312,Asymptotic behaviour of the integral of the quadratic mean of the coordinates on the hypercube,"I have to compute the limit $\lim_{n\to +\infty}I_n$, where:
$$\qquad I_n=\int_{[0,1]^n}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}\,d\mu.$$
I believe that its value is just $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, since the mean value of $x_i^2$ over the unit hypercube is $\frac{1}{3}$. 
Numerical experiments agree with this conjecture. Moreover, since the square root is a concave function, Jensen's inequality gives
$$ I_n \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$
and $\{I_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ looks to be a monotonic sequence, but an extra insight is needed to prove the conjecture, maybe a sort of converse of Jensen's inequality or a clever application of Fubini's theorem.","['asymptotics', 'inequality', 'integration', 'real-analysis']"

858599,"Intuitive interpretation of $\frac{\partial S(a,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial S(a,t)}{\partial a}$","I'm trying to visualize what the following equation is saying: $$\frac{\partial S(a,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial S(a,t)}{\partial a}$$ where $S$ is a probability-density, but I think you can assume any other quantity of interest (by the way, my variable of interest is the susceptibility of a person to a given disease), $a$ is a variable such as age and $t$ is time. I understand a simple solution for this equation is given by $S(a,t) = c (a - t)$. However, after plotting this plane, I can't intuitively grasp what the differential equation is actually doing. As I understand it, the left-hand side is describing the variation of $S(a,t)$ when we change a bit the time $t$. This should be equal to the variation of $S(a,t)$ when we change a bit the age $a$. In this particular example, I expect a reduction in $S(a,t)$ as we move through time (because here the susceptibility should decrease when people get older.) Therefore, I negative sign is appropriate. However, I don't see that intuition in the solution $S(a,t) = c (a - t)$ when I plot it. As a side note, the equation above doesn't describe the full dynamics of susceptibility. I dropped a few terms in order to simplify the analysis. UPDATE: I guess what is confusing me is that, in the left-hand side equation, we have the variation along $a$: $\displaystyle \frac{S(a + \Delta, t) - S(a,t)}{\Delta a}$, so we stay at the same time $t$ and move a bit in the $a$ direction . Similarly, the right side $\displaystyle \frac{S(a, t + \Delta) - S(a,t)}{\Delta t}$ means that we stay at the same (age) $a$ and move a bit in the $t$ direction. However, when I plot the solution $S(a,t)$, I can't see this solution expressing that a change in $t$ should be equal to a change in $a$ with opposite sign.

858792,A question on a lemma about the product map,"Here is a Lemma in the book “C*-algebras and Finite-Dimensional Approximations”: Lemma 3.8.4. Let $A$ be a C*-algebra, $M\subset B(H)$ be a con Neumann algebra and $\phi: A\rightarrow M$ be a completely positive map. Assume that the product map
  $$\phi \times \iota_{M}: A\odot M’ \rightarrow B(H),~\phi(\sum\limits_{i}a_{i}\otimes m_{i}’)=\sum\limits_{i}\phi(a_{i})m_{i}’.$$
  is continuous with respect to the spatial (or minimal) tensor product norm and let $\pi: M\rightarrow B(K)$ be any normal representation. Then the product map $$(\pi \circ \phi)\times \iota_{\pi(M)’}: A\odot \pi(M)’\rightarrow B(K).$$
  is also min-continuous (That is, continuous with respect to the spatial (or minimal) tensor product norm). Proof. Any normal representation of $M$ can be identified with the cut-down by a projection in the commutant of the representation $M\otimes 1_{K}\subset B(H\otimes K)$. Hence it suffices to show that the product map with the commutant in this particular representation is min-continuous. Since $(M\otimes 1_{K})'\cap B(H\otimes K)=M'\bar{\otimes} B(K)$ (Here, the $\bar{\otimes}$ denote the tensor product of two von Neumann algebra) -- just think of $B(H\otimes K)$ as matrices with entries in $B(H)$ -- we thus have to show that
  $$(\phi\otimes1_{B(K)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}: A\odot(M'\bar{\otimes B(K)}~)\rightarrow B(H\otimes K)$$
  is min-continuous. But, excepet for the horrific notation required, this is easy since $(\phi\otimes1_{B(K)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}$ is a point-strong limit of min-continuous maps (with uniformly bounded norms). More precisely, if $P\in B(K)$ is a finite-rank projection, then the map
  $$(\phi\otimes1_{B(PK)})\times\iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(PK)}: A\odot(M'\bar{\otimes B(PK)}~)\rightarrow B(H\otimes PK)$$ is min-continuous and its norm is bounded by $||\phi\times \iota_{M'}||$ because it can be identified with $$(\phi\times\iota_{M'})\otimes id_{B(PK)}: (A\odot M')\odot B(PK)\rightarrow B(H\otimes PK)$$ (Here, it use the Exercise 3.5.1 in this book). Finally, taking a net $\{P_{\lambda}\}$ of finite-rank projections which converge to $1_{K}$ in the strong operator topology and fixing $$x=\sum a_{i}\otimes T_{i}\in A\odot (M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)),$$
  it is easy to check that 
  $$(\phi\otimes 1_{B(P_{\lambda}K)})\times \iota_{M'\otimes B(P_{\lambda}K)}((1_{H}\otimes P_{\lambda})x(1_{H}\otimes P_{\lambda}))\rightarrow (\phi \otimes 1_{B(K)})\times \iota_{M'\bar{\otimes}B(K)}(x).$$

858978,Lamport claims there is an error in Kelley's proof of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem. What is it?,"In section 4.1 of his note How to write a proof , Leslie Lamport mentions an error in Kelley's exposition of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem: Some twenty years ago, I decided to write a proof of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem for an introductory mathematics class. The simplest proof I could find was in Kelley’s classic general topology text [4, page 28]. Since Kelley was writing for a more sophisticated audience, I had to add a great deal of explanation to his half-page proof. I had written five pages when I realized that Kelley’s proof was wrong. Recently, I wanted to illustrate a lecture on my proof style with a convincing incorrect proof, so I turned to Kelley. I could find nothing wrong with his proof; it seemed obviously correct! Read- ing and rereading the proof convinced me that either my memory had failed, or else I was very stupid twenty years ago. Still, Kelley’s proof was short and would serve as a nice example, so I started rewriting it as a structured proof. Within minutes, I rediscovered the error. However, Lamport doesn't explain what this error is.  I looked at Kelley's proof and stared at it for a long time, but I was unable to spot the mistake.  Could somebody please explain to me what this alleged mistake might be? Here's Kelley's proof (which he attributes to Birkhoff and Mac Lane) in its entirety (Kelley, General Topology, page 28): Theorem If there is a one-to-one function on a set $A$ to a subset of a set $B$ and there is also a one-to-one function on $B$ to a subset of $A$, then $A$ and $B$ are equipollent. Proof Suppose that $f$ is a one-to-one map of $A$ into $B$ and $g$ is one to one on $B$ to $A$.  It may be supposed that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint.  The proof of the theorem is accomplished by decomposing $A$ and $B$ into classes which are most easily described in terms of parthenogenesis.  A point $x$ (of either $A$ or $B$) is an ancestor of a point $y$ iff $y$ can be obtained from $x$ by successive application of $f$ and $g$ (or $g$ and $f$). Now decompose $A$ into three sets: let $A_E$ consist of all points of $A$ which have an even number of ancestors, let $A_O$ consist of points which have an odd number of ancestors, and let $A_I$ consist of points with infinitely many ancestors.  Decompose $B$ similarly and observe: $f$ maps $A_E$ onto $B_O$ and $A_I$ onto $B_I$, and $g^{-1}$ maps $A_O$ onto $B_E$. Hence the function which agrees with $f$ on $A_{E} \cup A_{I}$ and agrees with $g^{-1}$ on $A_{O}$ is a one-to-one map of $A$ onto $B$. I suspected that the error might lie with the edge-cases (the points in $A_E$ and $B_{E}$ with no ancestor), but there the argument seems to work.

859044,How does this discontinuity occur in evaluating a nested square root?,"This question is based on a comment I made on a question likely to be closed. Let $$y=\sqrt {x+ \sqrt {x+ \sqrt {x+ \sqrt {x+ \sqrt {x+ \dots}}}}}$$ be the classic nested square root which has appeared many times in questions in one form or another. We have $y^2=x+y$ so that $$y=\frac {1\pm\sqrt {1+4x}}2$$ Now if $x\gt 0$ then $y\gt 0$ and we must take the positive square root, and we have $y\gt 1$ and tends to $1$ as $x$ approaches zero from above. If $x=0$ it is obvious that we have $y=0$ and this is achieved by taking the negative square root in the quadratic formula. The positive square root gives the limit $1$ which looks ridiculous as a value of the expression. I am looking for an explanation of how this rather curious discontinuity arises - what are the danger signs that there might be a problem with this value? Note (8 July) - I'm still not satisfied that I have developed a sound intuition of what's going on here, except that nesting square roots need not commute with other limit operations at critical points - it is a nastier operation than meets the eye.","['nested-radicals', 'continuity', 'real-analysis', 'limits']"

859233,Mutual Information for Gaussian Process (and also Fano's Inequality),"According to this presentation: Bounding Gaussian Process Information Gain we have a closed-form expression for the information gain as follows:
$$
I\left(\vec{y} \mid f\right) = \frac{1}{2} \log\det \left[\bf{I} - \sigma^{-2} \bf{K}\right]
$$
Where $\vec{y}$ is a sampling of the Gaussian process at some number of points (say, $n$), $f$ is the Gaussian process, $\bf{K}$ is the covariance matrix. My question is a simple one, I think. Clearly the only aspect of the equation above that depends on the sample vector $\vec{y}$ is $\bf{K}$. Suppose we have that $n=1$ initially and that we are prepared to sample again from the Gaussian process at another point. Can we say anything about how the mutual information will change with the addition of the this new point into $\vec{y}$? That is, can we say that mutual information will certainly not decrease? Or can we say nothing at all? With respect to Fano's Inequality, I was having a read of the paper here: Information-Theoretic Limits of Selecting Binary Graphical Models in High Dimensions . In the paper, the author's state the following: A ""decoder"" (i.e. an estimator) $\phi : \mathcal{X}^n \to \left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$ is $\delta$-unreliable over the ""family"" (i.e. a set of models) $\left\{\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots, \theta_M\right\}$ if
$$
\max_{k = 1,\ldots, M} \mathbb{P}\left[\phi\left(X^n\right) \neq k\right] \geq \delta - \frac{1}{\log M}
$$
Here, they represent by $X^n$ a design matrix  of $n$ samples. Then they go on the say that Fano's Inequality yields an upper bound on the sample size that guarantees that any estimator is $\delta$-unreliable. This bound is,
$$
n < \frac{(1 - \delta) \log M}{I\left(X^{(1)} ; K\right)}
$$
where
$$
I\left(X^{(1)} ; K\right) = H\left(X^{(1)}\right) - H\left(X^{(1)} \vert K\right)
$$
is the mutual information. The authors do not state what $X^{(1)}$ is supposed to be, but I assume it is a single example from the design matrix (would be nice to get some clarification on this as well). The authors state that this  form of Fano's inequality (that upper bounds the number of samples that guarantees $\delta$-unreliability) is standard, and even provide some links to papers using it. That being said, I can't find this particular form of the inequality used or derived in those papers. So I am wondering if anyone can show me where it comes from.

859535,"Linear operator T that commutes with every projection operator, infinite dimensional case","This is related to a question of Hoffman & Kunze, Linear Algebra (Section 6.7, #8, p. 219).  The question in the text asks: Let $T$ be a linear operator on $V$ which commutes with every projection operator on $V$.  What can you say about $T$? If $V$ is finite-dimensional, I think that $T$ is then a scalar multiple of the identity.  (We know from an earlier exercise that if every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ is invariant under $T$ then $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity.  We also know that $TE = ET \implies E(V)$ is invariant under $T$.  Since we can construct a projection $E$ such that $E(V) = W$ for every subspace $W$ of $V$, we can then conclude that $T$ is a scalar multiple of the identity.) I then have two questions: is the reasoning above for the finite-dimensional case accurate?  How do we deal with the infinite-dimensional case?

According to a theorem of Lebesgue almost every point is a Lebesgue point, and obviously every point is Lebesgue if $f$ is continuous. Is the converse true? Are everywhere Lebesgue functions necessarily continuous? Such questions usually have a ""no"" answer but I don't see an obvious counterexample. It's easy to change a continuous function into a discontinuous one at a point, that's still Lebesgue at that point, by altering values on a sequence that converges to it.

I'm interested in an elementary, direct proof of when this happens without appealing to either quadratic reciprocity directly or to things like Gauss's lemma (which is sort of like quadratic reciprocity in disguise). For example, this answer gives a direct proof of $\kron 2p$. For $p \pmod 5$, this is not so bad. For instance, if $p \equiv 1 \pmod 5$, then one can use that $\left( \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \right)^\times$ is cyclic of order divisible by $5$ to get an element of order $5$, and then proceed as in this question .

I would like a sampling technique that has some set of parameters that I can tune (preferably continuously) that lets me smoothly transition between having a non-uniform sample that bunches at the ""poles"" and one that is uniformly distributed as above.  The exact nature of the ""bunching"" is not hugely important, as long as these two qualitative limiting behaviors exist. Obviously, I can get bunching at the poles by sampling $N$-dimensional polar angles uniformly on $\theta_i \in [0,2\pi]$, but I'm at a bit of a loss regarding how to continuously move the concentration away from the poles and become uniformly distributed.  Is there a sensible way to express the uniformly distributed equal-area sampling as a prior probability on the polar angles $\theta_i$?

It is about exercise 1.10 in particular. In this exercise, the following is asked (I reproduce all the relevant information given in the chapter): Let $x_0,\dots,x_n$ be a partition of the interval $[a,b]$ , $x_0=a, x_n=b$ . Let $\chi_i(x)$ be the characteristic function of $[x_{i-1},x_i)$ except for $\chi_n(x)$ which is the char. function of $[x_{n-1},x_n]$ . A function on $[a,b]$ of the form $\sum_{i=1}^n s_i\chi_i(x)$ is called a step function. The set of all step functions for all possible finite partitions of $[a,b]$ is a normed linear space with the norm $$\left\|\sum_{i=1}^n s_i\chi_i(x)\right\|_\infty=\sup_{x\ \in\ [a,b]}\left|\sum_{i=1}^n s_i\chi_i(x)\right|=\max_{i=1,\dots,n}\{s_i\}$$ We denote this space by $S[a,b]$ . Exercise 10: Prove that $S[a,b]$ is dense in the norm $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ in $PC[a,b]$ , the space of all possible bounded piecewise continuous functions on $[a,b]$ . The definition of 'dense' was given earlier in the book: Definition: A set $B$ in a metric space $M$ is called dense if every $x\in M$ is a limit of elements of $B$ . I am quite confused about what one is supposed to do to solve the exercise: Is it asking me to show that the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ -norm of any function in $PC[a,b]$ is the limit of the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ -norm of some function in $S[a,b]$ ? That statement seems trivial since, with these definitions, the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ -norm of a bounded function is just its supremum, so any step function with a suitably chosen highest $s_i$ has the same $\|\cdot\|_\infty$ -norm (or am I missing something here?).
