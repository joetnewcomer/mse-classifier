1432833,Is the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of a limit useful for either calculating or proving limits?,"I found this question and its subsequent answer extremely helpful in its example of the use of the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition to demonstrate the value of a limit. I also notice that the example itself seems to me to be quite easy to demonstrate without recourse to the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition. Having said that, is there value in this definition beyond mathematical rigour? Are there limit problems (in single variable calculus) that require the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition in order to either find a limit, demonstrate that one exists, or to prove a result?","['limits-without-lhopital', 'limits', 'epsilon-delta']"

1432869,On an equivalent definition of the derivative.,"I am following Real Mathematical Analysis by Pugh Pugh says that the statement $$f(x+h) = f(x) +f'(x)h + R(h) \implies \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{R(h)}{|h|} = 0 $$ is equivalent to the definition of derivative 
$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = f'(x)$$ I am having troubles with proving that one implies the other and the backwards direction too (I am not sure how can I pull $h$ out of the limit).","['real-analysis', 'derivatives']"
1432906,"Show Borel sets contain all of $[a,b)$","I am struggling with how to show that a collection, $\mathcal{I}$, of integrals of the form $[a,b)$ are contained within $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all the open sets. I have previously proved that $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$ = $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{C}$ such that $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{C}$ is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing the closed sets. I can show $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}\subseteq \mathcal{B}_\mathcal{I}$. The problem is when I try to show $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}\supseteq \mathcal{B}_\mathcal{I}$. Here is my thought process so far... Let $[a_n,b_n)\in\mathcal{I}$. Then $[a_n,b_n)\in\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{I}$. Note $[a_n,b_n)=[a_n,\frac{a_n+b_n}{2}]\cup(\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},b_n)$. Notice $[a_n,\frac{a_n+b_n}{2}]\in\mathcal{C}$ and $(\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},b_n)\in\mathcal{O}$. Then $[a_n,\frac{a_n+b_n}{2}]\in\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{C}$ and $(\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},b_n)\in\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$. Since $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{O}}=\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{C}}$, then $[a_n,\frac{a_n+b_n}{2}]\cup(\frac{a_n+b_n}{2},b_n)\in\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$ because $\mathcal{B}_\mathcal{O}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra. Therefore $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{O}}\supseteq\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{I}}$. Can I assume the union between the closed set and open set are still part of the Borel set? The closed set is countable, but is the open set countably infinite? I just want to check my thought process.","['elementary-set-theory', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology', 'measure-theory']"
1432966,Intuitive idea to consider strict epimorphism,"In a category with fiber products, a morphism $Y\to X$ is said to be strict epimorphism if the sequence is exact: $Y\times_XY\xrightarrow{p_1,p_2}Y\to X$, (here the first arrow should be a double arrow which means two parallel maps).

1433015,Radius of convergence when multiplying two complex power series?,"If $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(z-z_0)^n$ and $g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n(z-z_0)^n$ are complex power series whose radii of convergence are $R_1$ and $R_2$ correspondently, then the complex power series of $f(z)g(z)$ has a radius of convergence of what? I believe I have seen before that for two complex power series, the radius of convergence for $f(z)g(z)$ is $R = min({R_1, R_2})$. I have also seen before where the radius of convergence of $f(z)g(z)$ is $R \ge min({R_1,R_2})$. I believe the latter one is correct, but I am unsure. I assume the latter one is correct because of a simple example like this: Let $f(z) = \frac{1-z}{1+z}$ and $g(z) = \frac{1+z}{1-z}$. Both have a radius of convergence of $|z| < 1$. Yet $f(z)g(z) = 1$ and its series expansion has a radius of convergence of $\infty$. So which one is correct? Is one of them correct only in the case of a series expansion in real variables while one is only correct for complex variables? For whichever one is correct, how would you prove the result?

1433056,Constructing one-forms on a Riemann surface using the uniformization theorem,"I found this statement about proving the existence of one-forms on a Riemann surface in an answer on MathOverflow : This deep fact is essentially the same as the uniformization theorem.
  The problem is how to construct at least one holomorphic or
  meromorphic form with prescribed singularity. All known proofs use
  some Analysis, and none of them is simple. Once you have
  Uniformization, it is easy to construct holomorphic forms. Why is this easy? Uniformization tells us that any Riemann surface has a universal cover that is $\mathbb D$, $\mathbb C$, or $\mathbb P^1$. It is easy to transfer forms from the base space to the covering space by pulling back. But how do we use the covering map to construct forms with prescribed singularities on the base space?","['complex-analysis', 'riemann-surfaces']"

1433219,Why non-regular curves have cusp(s),"I'm very confused about the author's explanation of regular curves in my calculus book. The author says that a regular curve $\gamma:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}^3$ is a curve such that $\gamma'(t)\neq 0$ for all $t\in[a,b]$. The author then says that this is to ensure that there are no ""kinks"" or ""cusps"" in the curve, but I'm having difficulty understanding, visually, or intuitively why this is so. More precisely, does $\gamma'(t_0)=0$ if and only if the curve has a kink the point $\gamma(t_0)$? And why does it look like a kink? In my mind, I imgaine an insect flying in space, slowing down, stopping at some point $p$, and continuing it's flight from $p$. On an intuitive level, I think there could be a kink at $p$ because as the insect approaches $p$, it slows down along one line spanned by a tangent vector $v_1$ at $p$, but once it stops, it can continue its flight along another line spanned by a different tangent vector $v_2$ at $p$ (option A below). But it would also have the choice of stopping at $p$ and continuing in the same fashion it was before it slowed down and stopped (option B). So with the option B, it seems like you could have $\gamma'(t)\neq 0$ at $p$, and yet there would be no cusp at $p$. So just by looking at the graph, you wouldn't be able to tell if $\gamma$ was regular or not. Could someone please clarify?","['calculus', 'intuition']"

It states: If $\sum_n a_n$ converges , and if $\{b_n\}$ is monotonic and bounded , prove that $\sum_n a_n b_n$ converges .

Am I missing something? EDIT: Thanks everyone! @hermes: The last part of your proof gave me the following idea. As $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = c$ and $\{b_n\}$ is monotonic, couldn't we just set $b_n = c - c_n$ with a monotonically decreasing sequence $\{c_n\}$ which has $\lim_{n \to \infty} c_n = 0$ . Then we have $$\sum_n a_n b_n = \underbrace{c \sum_n a_n}_{\text{converges by assumption}} - \underbrace{\sum_n a_n c_n}_{\text{converges by Theorem 3.42}} \leq \varepsilon_1 - \varepsilon_2 = \varepsilon $$ since Theorem 3.42 Suppose the partial sums of $\sum_n a_n$ form a bounded space $\quad \checkmark$ $c_0 \geq c_1 \geq c_2 \geq \dots \quad \checkmark$ $\lim_{n \to \infty} c_n = 0 \quad \checkmark$ Then $\sum_n a_n c_n$ converges.

1433356,"ElGamal signatures and ""related randomness""","As part of a security CTF competition , the following variation of the ElGamal signature scheme had to be broken: Let $q$ be prime and $p = 2q + 1$ also prime. In practice these two primes were hardcoded. The source code of the signature and verficiation algorithm is available as a Gist. The order of the multiplicative subgroup generated by $g = 2$ in $F_p$ has order $q$. A signature for a message hash $m$ and a private key $x$ is produced as follows: Select an integer $k$ ""randomly"" in the range $[0, q)$ Compute $r = g^k \ \text{mod}\  p$ Emit the signature $(s = k^{-1} (m + xr) \ \text{mod}\  q, r \ \text{mod}\ q)$ The difference between this and classic ElGamal is that $m + xr$ is used instead of $m - xr$.
The verification is thus also slightly more complicated. Now we are given the signatures $(s_1, r_1)$ and $(s_2, r_2)$ for the two messages $m_1 =$ sha256(""foo"") and $m_2 =$ sha256(""bar""). $k_1$ is indeed chosen randomly, however we have $k_2 = (a\cdot k_1 + b) \ \text{mod}\  2^{1024}$ for $a = 713030730552717, b = 123456789$. The task is to recover the private key $x$ from this information. I know that randomness reuse is a dealbreaker for ElGamal, however I haven't been able to use a similar approach to break the ""related randomness"" used here. It seems especially tricky that the linear relation between $k_1$ and $k_2$ is only modulo $2^{1024}$, not modulo $q$. EDIT: OK I think I figured out one step towards the solution: We have (modulo q): (1) $k \cdot s_1 = m_1 + x\cdot r_1$ (2) $((ak + b) \ \text{mod} \ 2^{1024}) s_2 = m_2 + x\cdot r_2$ Multiply the first equation with $l = r_2 / r_1 \ \text{mod} \ q$: (1') $lk \cdot s_1 = l\cdot m_1 + x\cdot r_2$ With high probability, we have $(ak + b) \ \text{mod} \ 2^{1024} = ak  \ \text{mod} \ 2^{1024}  + b$. Subtracting (2) - (1') we then get: $((ak \ \text{mod}\  2^{1024}) s_2 - lk \cdot s_1) = m_2 - m_1 \cdot l - b \cdot s_2$ If the reduction modulo $2^{1024}$ wasn't there, it would be trivial from here to recover $k$ because it is the only unknown value in the equation. With it however, I don't know how to proceed.","['cryptography', 'number-theory']"

1433398,"How do I express this vector field, given ""in terms of $\mathbb{C}$"", in the standard notation for derivations?","In a set of lecture notes (not available online) that I'm currently working through, one is given the following set-up: Consider rotational vector fields on the plane
      $\mathbb{R}^{2}\cong\mathbb{C}$ with coordinates $(x,y)\cong
    z=x+\imath y$.  Let $X$ be the vector field given by $X(z)=\imath
    z=-y+\imath x\in\mathbb{C}\cong T_{z}\mathbb{C}$, i.e. 
      $X(x,y)=-y\partial_{x}+x\partial_{y}$. This is all fine by me, but there is one thing that I don't understand: How do I express $X(z)$ in terms of the standard notation for tangent vectors (i.e. I'm looking for the complex equivalent of $X(x,y)=-y\partial_x+x\partial_y$). There are two approaches that seem sensible, but they give irreconcilable results---at least so it seems: Use $z=x+\imath y$ and $\partial_z=\frac{1}{2}(\partial_x-\imath\partial_y)$ and directly ""translate"" the expression in real coordinates. This yields [algebra corrected in edit] $$X(z)=\imath\frac{z-\bar z}{2}(\partial_z+\partial_{\bar z})
+\imath\frac{z+\bar z}{2}(\partial_z-\partial_{\bar z})
=\imath (z\partial_z -\bar z\partial_{\bar z}) $$ Assume that the isomorphism $\mathbb C\cong T_z\mathbb C $ identifies $X(z)\in \mathbb{C}$ with $X(z)\partial_z+0\cdot\partial_{\bar z}$ so that we obtain 
$$ X(z)=\imath z \partial_z $$
But when ""translating back"" to real variables one then obtains
$$ X(z)=\frac{1}{2}\imath(x+\imath y)(\partial_x-\imath \partial_y)
=\frac{1}{2}\Big((\imath x-y)\partial_x+(x+\imath y)\partial_y\Big)$$ At first sight, it seems reasonable to simply say that the second method is based on a wrong assumption, and to simply dismiss it (even though I don't know why it's wrong). However, continuing in the lecture notes I find Its trajectories are given
      by $c_{z}(t)=e^{\imath t}z$.  Indeed, $\dot{c}_{z}(t)=\imath
    e^{\imath t}z=\imath c_{z}(t)$. Assuming the first approach is correct we indeed obtain something different: It seems like the ""translation"" to the tangent space notation was not only useless (since the solution simply seems to solve the equation $c'(t)=\imath c$ with initial condition $c(0)=z$) but leads to the wrong solution! Of course, the second approach here does give the correct result... My question is therefore twofold: What does the vector field $X$ correspond to in terms of the notation for derivations of smooth functions on $\mathbb C$, and is this at all relevant for finding its integral curves (trajectories)? If the answer to the latter is ""no"", please elaborate! EDIT : After correcting some elementary mistakes pointed out in the answers, some of the confusion is resolved, but part of the question still stands.","['complex-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

$$ where $A=A^T$ is a symmetric $n\times n$ complex matrix with positive definite real part. Question: can we explicitly calculate this integral (for complex $A$ ) without using analytic continuation? Motivation: the standard proof of the above result starts off with a real $A$ and uses Cholesky decomposition to decouple the integral into $n$ one-dimensional Gaussian. (Diagonalizing $A$ with an orthogonal matrix with Jacobian $J=1$ essentially does the same.) Then one argues that, as long as the real part of $A$ remains positive definite, both sides are holomorphic and by analytic continuation the integral must have the value of the right hand side even for complex $A$ , (see a good discussion on this here ). My question is motivated by the observation that for $n=1$ everything is scalar, $\det A=A$ , and one can prove the above result for $\Re A>0$ using Cauchy theorem and contour integration with complex Jacobian $J=\sqrt{A}$ , $\arg\sqrt{A}\in(-\pi/4,\pi/4)$ . There is no need for analytic continuation (unless of course you want to go to $\Re A<0$ ), see the proof here .

Let $\pi : C \to Spec(k)$ be a smooth curve (i.e. a separated, smooth morphism of finite presentation and relative dimension $1$) I am trying to understand a few assertions about what an effective Cartier divisor on $C$ looks like that I read in Katz-Mazur's book Arithmetic of elliptic curves (freely available here : https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nmk/katz-mazur.djvu ) Here are a few assertions that I am having trouble to understand : 1) Any section $\sigma : Spec(k) \to C$ of $\pi$ defines an effective cartier divisor (a section of a separated morphism is a closed immersion). That would algebraically translate, if i'm not mistaken, to the fact that if $A$ is a dimension one, regular finite type algebra over $k$, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a maximal ideal that is the kernel of a morphism $A \to k$ then $m$ is a locally free $A$-module of rank one. 2)If $D \subset C$ is a closed subscheme that is finite over $Spec(k)$ then $D$ is an effective cartier divisor. Using the same notation as before if would translate as : if $I$ is an ideal of $A$ such that $A/I$ is a finite dimensional $k$-vector space then $I$ is locally free of rank one. 3)An effective Cartier divisor in $C$ is a finite $k$-scheme : if $I$ is a locally free $A$-ideal of rank $1$ then $A/I$ is a finite dimensional vector space. So basically I think if we put it all together it comes down to the following statement : Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field, $A$ be regular $k$ algebra of finite type and dimension $1$ and $I$ be an ideal of $A$. Then $I$ is invertible (i.e. locally free of rank $1$) if and only if $A/I$ is a finite dimensional $k$ vector space. Is this true ?

A group $G$ cannot be the union of two proper subgroups , however Scorza's theorem implies that $G=H_1\cup H_2\cup H_3\iff G/(H_1\cap H_2\cap H_3)\cong V$ for proper $H\subset G$. The only vector space canonically isomorphic to its dual is $V$. See Martin's answer here , the idea traces back to ACL's comment which gives earlier attribution. Given $\{0,a,b,c\}$ is a copy of $V$, one can define e.g. the dual vector $a^*$ to be the characteristic function of $\{b,c\}$. Say $G$ is a functor from the category ${\sf B}_n$ of sets of cardinality $n$ with bijections into $\sf Grp$, equipped with a natural transformation $G\to{\rm Perm}$ consisting of injective group homomorphisms. One calls $GX$ a natural permutation group on $X$. The only natural permutation groups are trivial, alternating, symmetric, and $V$ on four element sets.

However, $X^a=\delta^a_{\ b}X^b$, and the covariant derivative of $\delta$ is zero, thus $$ R^a_{\ bcd}X^b=[\nabla_c,\nabla_d](\delta^a_{\ b}X^b)=\delta^a_{\ b}[\nabla_c,\nabla_d]X^b, $$ and from this we can decouple $X$, and we get $$ R^a_{\ bcd}=\delta^a_{\ b}[\nabla_c,\nabla_d]. $$
I have never seen this expression before like this, and also I can see a fundamental issue with this. All information regarding the Riemann-tensor is already contained in $[\nabla_c,\nabla_d]$, and the Kronecker-delta is only required to have the proper index structure. This expression is also manifestly skew-symmetric in $c$ and $d$, but the Riemann-tensor is also skew in $a$ and $b$, and the expression $$ \delta^a_{\ b}[\nabla_c,\nabla_d] $$ is manifestly symmetric in $a$ and $b$. I realize that this might be due to the fact that while this expression looks like the tensor product of the identity tensor with the commutator of covariant derivatives, but since the commutator is not a tensor field, this is not true, and when we contract this expression with $b$ we not only interact with the delta tensor, but also with the derivative operators, however I don't see any invalid moves I would have performed in deriving this, yet this form is symmetric in the first two indices, but the Riemann-tensor is skew in the first two indices.

1433894,If G has a composition series so does H and G/H,"Let $G$ be a group having a composition series and $H$ a normal subgroup of $G$. Show that there exists a composition series in which one term is $H$. My idea is to use the Schreier refinement theorem. Let $G=G_0 \triangleright G_1 \triangleright G_2 \triangleright \dots \triangleright G_m = \{ e \}$ be a composition series for $G$. Now consider $G\triangleright H \triangleright \{ e\}$, if this is a composition series we are done. If not, by the Schreier refinement theorem there exists equivalent refinements of these two series. Call these refinements $R_1$ and $R_2$, where $R_1$ is the refinement of the composition series. Now because these two refinements are equivalent the factors of $R_2$ are isomorphic to factors of $R_1$. Now because $R_1$ is a refinement of a composition series this means all of its factors are simple groups. Thus all the factors of $R_2$ are simple. Thus if we remove groups from $R_2$ in a way such that we eliminate trivial factors this should give us a composition series for $G$ that contains $H$. Does this solution seem correct?

It could be closed! Problem: Suppose that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ by a function $f:U\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ , we know that $f$ is bijective and continuous by definition. This means it is surjective. Thus $f^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^n)=U$ By continuity of $f$ this means that $U$ is open in $M$ This is a contradiction, as $U$ need not be open.

Thoughts: I understand that any open interval (in $\mathbb{R}$ ) is homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}$ however the union of two distinct intervals is open but not homeomorphic to all of $\mathbb{R}$ , using this sort of logic it suggests that: I require (probably through the Hausdorff property) the ability to find a small enough connected (I suspect) open set.

Call the symmetric matrix $A$. Write the quadratic form for $A$ as $x^{t}Ax$, where superscript $t$ denotes transpose. $A$ p.d.

1434565,"Find the minimum value of $\frac{(a^2+a+1)(b^2+b+1)(c^2+c+1)}{abc}$ if $a,b,c$ are positive integers.","I can't see any rigorous method. I did it by trial and error. For $0$, it would be undefined. For $1$, the answer comes $27$. Also, if we see the numerator, when we multiply all the $3$ terms, there would be a $abc$ and $a^2b^2c^2$ term. Which tells that numerator will increase faster than the denominator. We have to minimize the numerator and at the same time maximise the denominator. But by the earlier observation, it seems that $27$ is the answer. Is it right? Or is there a rigorous method also? Please don't use any complex theorems, only algebra.",['algebra-precalculus']
1434577,Soundness and Completeness of the d-separation,"I was reading Koller's book on Probabilistic Graphical Models and was wondering how to prove soundness and completeness of the d-separation ? Let me explain what is d-separation and it's properties soundness and completeness which needs to be proved in order to prove d-separation. d-separation has been based on intuitions regarding flow of influence in Bayesian Networks (BN). In other words there is no grantee that d-separation is ""correct.""
Perhaps there is a distribution over the BN where X can influence Y despite the fact that all trails between them are blocked. Hence, the first property we want to ensure for d-separation as a method for determining independence is soundness : if we find that two nodes X and Y are d-separated given some Z, then we are guaranteed that they are, in fact, conditionally independent given Z. Theorem : If a distribution P factorizes according to G, then I(G) ⊆ I(P). In other words, any independence reported by d-separation is satisfied by the underlying distribution. A second desirable property is the complementary one — completeness : d-separation detects all possible independencies.  More precisely, if we have that two variables X and Y are independent
given Z, then they are d-separated. A careful examination of the completeness property reveals that it is ill defined, inasmuch as it does not specify the distribution in which X and Y are independent. To formalize this property, we first define the following notion:
A distribution P is faithful to G if, whenever (X ⊥ Y | Z) ∈ I(P), then d-sepG(X; Y | Z). In other words, any independence in P is reflected in the d-separation properties of the graph. We can now provide one candidate formalization of the completeness property is as follows: For any distribution P that factorizes over G, we have that P is faithful to G; that is, if X and Y are not d-separated given Z in G, then X and Y are dependent in all distributions P that factorize over G.

1434580,Why can't I measure the distance this way?,"The problem is to find the distance between the point $(3, -2, 4)$ and the plane $2x-5y+z=10$ I tought of doing it like this: The shortest line between the point and the plane is orthogonal to the plane, so it's direction is $<2, -5, 1>$, and a point on this line is $(3, -2, 4)$ . That means that the line has the parametric equations $x=3+2t, y=-2-5t, z=4+t$. I plugged in $x, y, z$ into the plane equation and got $\dfrac{1}{11}$ for $t$. This means that the distance between the plane and the point should be the distance between the point $(3, -2, 4)$ and the point $x=3+2(\dfrac{1}{11}), y=-2-5(\dfrac{1}{11}), z=4+(\dfrac{1}{11})$ I got $\dfrac{\sqrt{29}}{11}$ as the distance, but WolframAlpha says its $\sqrt{\frac{10}{3}}$","['calculus', '3d', 'analytic-geometry', 'geometry', 'multivariable-calculus']"

1434619,Chi-Squared distribution as an Exponential Family Distribution,"I'm trying to write the chi-squared distribution in the form of:
$$\exp\big\{(y\theta-b(\theta))/(\phi/w)-c(y,\phi)\big\}.$$ Using a shape-mean paramatization of the gamma distribution (i.e. taking shape parameter $\alpha$ and rate $\beta$, then re-parametrizing the $\beta$ parameter with $\mu=\alpha/\beta$, I was able to write the gamma distribution in this form, with: $$\theta=-1/\mu,\  b(\theta) = -\log(-\theta),\ \phi=1/\alpha,\ w=1,$$ and $$c(y,\phi) = \log(\Gamma(\alpha))-\alpha \log(\alpha)-(\alpha-1)\log(y).$$ As the chi-square is a special case of the gamma distribution with shape $\alpha=k/2$ and rate $\beta=1/2$, I initially tried using this. However I end up with $\theta=-1/k$ and $\phi=2/k$. In other words, the top and bottom of the first term in the exponential pdf form are literally just multiplied by $1/k$ in order to force a canonical parameter in there. This seems a bit weird to me - especially as if $\phi$ is a function of $\theta$, then $c(y,\phi)$ is a function of $\theta$ too, which it shouldn't be. Other than that, I get a canonical parameter of $\theta=-1$. However, the $b()$ function is not meant to rely upon $\phi$, so there is no way of having $b'(\theta)=k$. tldr: how do I go about expressing the chi-square pdf in the form of the exponential family of probability distribution?

1434741,Every Continuous Function Attains Maximum Implies Compact,"Let $K$ be a compact metric space, and let $A \subset K$. Prove that $A$ is compact if and only if, for every continuous function $f:K \to \mathbb{R}$,  there exists a $q \in A$ so that $$f(q) = \max_{a \in A} \{f(a)\}.$$ i.e. $f$ attains its maximum on the restriction to $A$. Here's an attempt: The forward direction is a standard theorem. Suppose conversely every restriction attains its maximum on $A$. Let $\rho \in \overline{A}$. We shall show $\rho \in A$ and therefore $A$ is closed, and being a subset of a compact space, compact. Suppose $\rho \notin A$. Let $\{a_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \to \rho$. There exists a continuous function $f: K \to \mathbb{R}$ which attains its maximum at $\rho$ (for example, $d:A \to \mathbb{R}$ with $d: x \mapsto -d(x,\rho)$). In particular, $f: \overline{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and has a maximum at $\rho$. Therefore, given $\epsilon >0$, there exists $\delta >0$ so that $f(B_\delta(\rho)) \subset B_\epsilon (f(\rho)).$ Choose any $a_{n_1} \in B_\delta(\rho)$. Then, we may take $0 < \tilde{\epsilon} < \epsilon$ and $0< \tilde{\delta}< d(a_{n_1},\rho)$ so that, given $a_{n_2} \in B_{\tilde{\delta}}$, $f(a_{n_2}) > f(a_{n_1})$. Repeating this process indefinitely, we see that $f$ cannot attain a maximum on $a$, a contradiction. We conclude $\rho \in A$, so that $A$ is compact. Any issues? Other methods of proof are welcome. In fact, it'd be great to see alternatives. I've never seen this result anywhere, so I thought it interesting.","['analysis', 'proof-verification', 'real-analysis']"

1434781,$G$ solvable $\implies$ composition factors of $G$ are of prime order.,"I'm trying to prove the equivalency of the following definitions for a finite group, $G$: (i) $G$ is solvable, i.e. there exists a chain of subgroups $1 = G_0  \trianglelefteq G_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq G_s = G $ such that $G_{i+1}/ \ G_i$ is abelian for all $0 \leq i \leq s-1$ (ii) $G$ has a chain of subgroups $1 = H_0  \trianglelefteq H_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq H_s = G $ such that $H_{i+1} /\  H_i$ is cyclic for all $0 \leq i \leq s-1$. (iii) All composition factors of $G$ are of prime order. (iv) G has a chain of subgroups $1 = N_0  \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq N_t = G $ such that each $N_i$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, and $N_{i+1}/ \ N_i$ is abelian for all $0 \leq i \leq t-1$. It was simple to show that (iii) $\implies$ (ii) and (ii) $\implies$ (i). Now, I'm trying to prove that (i) $\implies$ (iii), and I'm getting stuck. I know that If $G$ is an abelian simple group, then $|G|$ is prime, so all I need to show is that each $G_{i+1}/ \ G_i$ in the definition of solvable is simple. If I knew that $1 = G_0  \trianglelefteq G_1 \trianglelefteq \cdots \trianglelefteq G_s = G $ were a composition series, then each $G_{i+1}/ \ G_i$ would be simple by definition. But the definition of solvable doesn't assume a composition series. I know every group has a unique composition series, but I'm not sure how to connect that to the subgroups in the definition of solvable. More generally, I guess I just don't understand how being abelian connects to being of simple or of prime order.
