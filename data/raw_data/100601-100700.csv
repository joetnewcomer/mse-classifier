1395657,On counting and generating all $k$-permutations of a multiset,"Let $A$ be a finite set, and $\mu:A \to \mathbb{N}_{>0}$.  Let $M$ be the multiset having $A$ as its ""underlying set of elements"" and $\mu$ as its ""multiplicity function"".  (Hence $M$ is finite.) Let $0 \leq k \leq \left|M\right|$ be an integer. This question is about the set $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$ of all $k$-permutations of elements from the multiset $M$. For example, if $k = 3$ and $M$ is the multiset $\{0, 0, 1, 2\}$, then $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$ comprises these 12 $k$-permutations: $$
(0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 1), \\
(1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)
$$ I am interested in an efficient (and preferably non-recursive) algorithm for generating all the elements of $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$ (in any order); a way to determine the cardinality of the set $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$ without generating all its elements (IOW, without resorting to the solution of (1)). (I had no trouble coming up with a recursive algorithm to generate all the elements of $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$, but it is impractical, for two reasons, both having to do with my algorithm's recursive structure: (1) its space requirements grow very rapidly with $\left|A\right|$, and (2) there is no simple way to implement it so that it can be ""gracefully interrupted"" (e.g. in an interactive setting) 1 .  These two shortcomings are not independent: the severity of (1) is what makes the interruptibility mentioned in (2) desirable.) My guess is that a fair bit of work has been done on this problem, but all the searches I've tried are swamped by hits pointing to similar-sounding but substantially different problems.  (Many of these false hits turn out to be easier special cases of the problem described here.)  Similarly, I spent some time flipping through Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics , v. 1 , but I was not able to find what I was looking for (even though odds are that the problem is discussed somewhere in this work). Therefore, in lieu of answers to 1 and 2 above, I could also use search keywords that will lead to the prior work on this problem; (in particular, is there a name for the integers $\mathbf{P}(M, k)$?) 1 By this I mean that the computation can be aborted (e.g. through some user-initiated signal or some pre-configured time-out) without having to bring down the entire process.","['algorithms', 'combinatorics']"

Then consider all of its possible subsequences $(x_{n_k})$.

Otherwise we have countably many numbers that the original sequence approaches arbitrarily closely countably many times in its tail. Is there some kind of argument that this would require an uncountable sequence? My thought is we could take the supposed countable set, and then choose some $\epsilon>0$ so that no two limits live in the same $\epsilon$-ball. Far enough down each subsequence, no element in the tail of one subsequence can also be in the tail of another. From here, is the argument like Cantor's diagonalization? Limits: subseq $a_1 : x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, x_{n_3}, \dots$ $a_2 : x_{m_1}, x_{m_2}, x_{m_3}, \dots$ $a_3 : x_{o_1}, x_{o_2}, x_{o_3}, \dots$ We would need uncountably many limits for these subsequences to be unique, and this contradicts the original sequence being countable.","['infinity', 'sequences-and-series']"

I have to show that $\mathcal E([a,b])$ is dense in $\mathcal C^0([a,b])$. There is my proof: Let $f\in\mathcal C^0([a,b])$ and $\varepsilon>0$. Since $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ it's also uniformly continuous and thus, there is a $\delta>0$ s.t. $|f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon$ for all $x,y\in[a,b]$ s.t. $|x-y|<\delta$. Let $a=x_0<x_1<...<x_n=b$ such that $x_{i+1}-x_i<\delta$ for all $i$. We set $\varphi(x)=f(x_i)$ for all $i=0,...,n-1$ and $\varphi(x_n)=f(x_n)$. Therefore, if $x\in[a,b[$, there is a $i$ such that $x_i\leq x<x_{i+1}$ and thus $$|f(x)-\varphi(x)|=|f(x)-\varphi(x_i)|<\varepsilon$$ since $|x-x_i|<\delta$.

Theorem: If $\lim_{x\to c}$f(x) =$\infty$ then $\lim_{x\to c} \frac{1}{f(x)}$ = $0$ Proof: Rewriting the above statement using the definition of limits and definition of infinite limits: ($ 0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow f(x)>M)$ $\Longrightarrow (0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow |\frac{1}{f(x)} -0|< \epsilon $) where $\epsilon$ and $M$ are both greater than zero and M denotes any real number. Taking the second conditional statement:      ($0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow |\frac{1}{f(x)} -0|< \epsilon $) we can see that (i) $$-\epsilon <\frac{1}{f(x)} <\epsilon$$ Taking the first conditional statement:
 $ 0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow f(x)>M$, we can conclude using the reciprocal of inequalities that $f(x)>M>0$ is equivalent to (ii)$$0<\frac{1}{f(x)}<\frac{1}{M}$$ From (i) and (ii) we get$$0<\frac{1}{f(x)}<\frac{1}{M}<\epsilon.$$ Meaning for any chosen value of $\epsilon>0$ and $M>0$ we can rewrite the theorem as 
($ 0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow \frac{1}{f(x)}<\frac{1}{M}<\epsilon )$ $\Longrightarrow (0<|x-c|<\delta \Rightarrow |\frac{1}{f(x)} -0|< \epsilon $)

Show that there are numbers c and d so that $F(A) = cTr(A^2) + d(Tr(A))^2$.  Here, Tr(A) is the trace of A. Edited work: Since A is symmetric, then we know that A is orthogonally diagonalizable, so that there's an orthogonal matrix Q such that $QAQ^t$ = D, where D is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of A on the main diagonal.

Now, the problem reduces to proving the equation for diagonal matrices. As whacka stated in his answer below, considering only the permuted, diagonal matrices, then F defines a quadratic form in the variables $\lambda_i$, for $1\le i \le n$. So, we have $$ F(\lambda_1, ... \lambda_n) = \sum_{i,k} f_{iikk}\lambda_i \lambda_k $$ $$ = \sum_{i=k} \alpha_i (\lambda_i)^2 + \sum_{i,k} \beta_{ik}\lambda_i \lambda_k $$ $$ = \sum_{i=k} \alpha_i (\lambda_i)^2 + \sum_i \sum_k \beta_{ik}\lambda_i \lambda_k$$ $$ ?? = \sum_{i=k} \alpha_i (\lambda_i)^2 + \beta_{ik} (\sum_i\ \lambda_i\sum_k  \lambda_k) $$ $$ = \alpha_i Tr(A^2) + \beta_{i,k}(Tr(A))^2$$ $$=F(A)$$ And, since F is invariant under any permutation of the eigenvalues on the diagonal, then this quadratic polynomial is also invariant; hence, the coefficients $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_{i,k}$ exist, are well-defined, and unique. How is my proof?  I don't feel confident about the equality that I labeled (??).

I ask this question because I have just learned a result in Riemannian geometry that could be interpreted as saying that curvature is the obstruction in the Riemannian case.

In that setting one uses strongly the existence of exponential maps and parallel transport (and curvature!), so I don't expect anything to carry over literally. I am just curious if one can make a connection in this way. I know that one can always extend when the map $i$ is replaced by an $k$-algebra isomorphism of the germ of functions at those points.

So in a way I am asking the following commutative algebra question: If $(R,M)$ and $(S,N)$ are local $k$-algebras admitting an $k$-linear isomorphism $N/N^2 \to M/M^2$, what is the obstruction to extending this to an isomorphism of $R$ to $S$?","['algebraic-geometry', 'commutative-algebra']"

For $s \geq 1$, $s + \frac{2}{3} \geq \frac{5}{3} > 1$ and so there is no $x \in K$ such that $x \geq s + \frac{2}{3}$. (Inductive case)
Suppose that $x = 0.a_1a_2\cdots$. If $a_1 = 0$, then $3x \in K$ so by the inductive hypothesis we have two cases. The first case is $3x \leq \frac{3s + 1} {3^k}$  for all $s$, so $x \leq \frac{3s+1}{3^{k + 1}}$ for all $s$. The second case is that $3x \geq \frac{3s + 2}{3^k}$ for all $s$, so $x \geq \frac{3s + 2}{3^{k + 1}}$ for all $s$. Now here is where I get stuck. If $a_1 = 2$, then $3x - 2 \in K$, so we can apply the inductive hypothesis and similar reasoning to obtain that, for all $s$ either $x \leq \frac{3s + 1}{3^{k + 1}} + \frac{2}{3}$ or $x \geq \frac{3s+2}{3^{k + 1}} + \frac{2}{3}$. The problem is of course that rescaling the interval $[\frac{2}{3}, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$ ""shifts"" the $s$ value when compared to the intervals excluded in the previous step of the induction. I have an intuition that if $a_1 = 1$ it suffices to consider the case where $\frac{3s + 1}{3^{k + 1}} \geq \frac{2}{3}$, as the other cases are covered by the case where $a_1 = 0$, but I have no idea how to formalise this intuition. So could someone give me hints as to how to complete this proof, or at least how to formalise the aforementioned intuition?","['cantor-set', 'real-analysis', 'general-topology']"
1397274,Showing $U(n)/Z(U(n))=SU(n)/Z(SU(n))$,"I was working on the following problem from Stillwell's Naive Lie Theory . Prove that $U(n)/Z(U(n))=SU(n)/Z(SU(n))$. It was shown earlier in the text that $Z(U(n))=\{ e^{i\theta} \textbf{1}: \theta \in \mathbb{R} \} \cong S^{1}$ and $Z(SU(n))=\{ \omega \textbf{1}: \omega^{n}=1 \text{ and } \omega \in \mathbb{C} \}$.  We have that $\textbf{1}$ denotes the identity matrix. When thinking about this problem, I first considered the case where $n=2$. We have that unitary matrices in $U(2)$ are of the form
\begin{equation*}
e^{i\theta}
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha &-\beta \\ \bar{\beta} & \bar{\alpha} 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
We have that the relation which sends $e^{i\theta}
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha &-\beta \\ \bar{\beta} & \bar{\alpha} 
\end{bmatrix}$ to $
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha &-\beta \\ \bar{\beta} & \bar{\alpha} 
\end{bmatrix}$ seems to be a well defined function from $U(2) \rightarrow  SU(2)/Z(SU(2)$ since the center $Z(SU(2))$ consists of the matrices $\pm \textbf{1}$. This function even is a homorphism that  has $Z(U(2))$ as it's kernel. From here we can conclude that $U(2)/Z(U(2))=SU(2)/Z(SU(2))$ $\textbf{However, I am having trouble generalizing from here}$","['abstract-algebra', 'lie-groups']"

E\left[f(Z,U)e^{\frac{V^2-(V+W)^2}{2}} \right]

E\left[f(Z,U)e^{\frac{V^2-(V+W)^2}{2}} \right]&=

1397378,The theory in probability,"Consider a real-life experiment (perhaps written as a problem in a textbook): A coin is continually tossed until two consecutive heads are observed. Assume that the results of the tosses are mutually independent and the coin is fair. What is the expected number of tosses before the experiment ends? Now, how would one solve this problem? First, we would need to define a probability space to model the experiment. The issue is that there are so many possibilities: We could define the sample space to be an uncountable set of all infinite-length strings of $H$ and $T$. This sample space already does not seem to fulfill the experiment's condition: that it terminates once two consecutive heads are observed. E.g. $HHTTTTT...$ and $HHHHHHH...$ are different outcomes in the sample space but are actually considered the same in the experiment (since we terminate after two heads). So to say that a sample space consists of all possible distinct outcomes of an experiment seem wrong to me. And yet, according to many sources, this is a natural space to use. Also, there can be infinitely many $\sigma$-algebras so there's the question of which one to use too. Lastly for the probability measure we can use the assumption that the coin is fair and the results of the tosses are independent so $P(\text{outcome starts with }TH) = P(\text{first toss is }T)P(\text{second toss is }H) = 0.25$, for example. We could take outcomes of the experiment to be the entire string of heads and tails from the start until termination of the experiment. So our sample space has all finite-length strings of $T$ and $H$ ending with $HH$, as well as infinite length strings that do not contain $HH$ as a substring. This space is uncountable, so again there are infinitely many $\sigma$-algebras. Now how do we define a probability measure? We should have $P(\text{outcome starts with }HHH) = P(\text{first toss is }H)P(\text{second toss is }H)P(\text{third toss is }H) = 0.125$ since the coins are fair and independent, but there are no outcomes starting with $HHH$ in this sample space, so this probability should actually be $0$. So my guess is that, instead we assume that $P(\text{$k$-th toss is heads | outcome starts with $s$}) = 0.5$, where $s$ is any $(k-1)$-length string containing no $HH$. Now this is stated nowhere in the given problem, and yet is very intuitive in the conventional sense of ""independence"" in the real world. Is this correct? We could only take the finite-length strings of $T$ and $H$ that end with $HH$, and ignore the infinite length strings. Now the question is: how do we know this is indeed the set of all outcomes? How do we know this is a valid assumption? Of course this simplifies a lot of things since the space is now discrete. We could even take the last 4 (or less) coin flips of finite runs as well as infinite runs as the sample space, so $$\Omega = \{HH, THH, \text{ends with }TTHH, \text{ends with }HTHH\}\cup \{s : s\text{ is an infinite string of $H$ and $T$}\}.$$ Now independence is defined only in the context of a probability space. So in this space we have $$\begin{eqnarray*}P(HH) &=& P(\text{last toss is }H \cap \text{2nd last toss is }H) \\&=& P(\text{last toss is }H)P(\text{2nd last toss is }H) \\&=& 0.25\\
P(THH) &=& 0.125\\
P(\text{ends with }TTHH) = P(\text{ends with }HTHH) &=& 0.0625.\end{eqnarray*}$$ So $P(\text{infinite string of $H$ and $T$}) = 1 - 0.25 - 0.125 - 0.0625 - 0.0625 = 0.5$. But clearly this does not conform to the above 3 models. So can we use this as a probability space? What is the issue here? Intuitively I can see how the probability spaces 1 to 3 all compute the same expectation. There are also countless other spaces that do too. The question is, is it possible to rigorize all this? It seems that each space above has some problems with it that raises the question of whether it is appropriate. Am I right to say that this portion relies completely on intuition and cannot possibly be rigorized? That is, the theory and mathematical rigor only starts after we have defined the probability space. Of course, then the question comes: how do we know our probability space ""works"" aside from intuition? Can we know that two different probability spaces will give us the same answer to a question? Also, am I right that there are actually way more assumptions in probability aside from the probability space? For instance: Independence in mathematical context is just $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ but in real life we say that this means occurrence of $A$ does not affect probability of $B$ -- is this an assumption? $P(A | B) = P(A \cap B)/P(B)$ but in real life, we say $P(A | B)$ is the chance that $A$ occurs, given that $B$ has happened -- is this an assumption? The expected value of random variable $X$ is just defined as $E(X) = \sum_{\omega\in\Omega}P(\omega)X(\omega)$ in discrete spaces but in real life, we say it is the mean of $X$ if the experiment is repeated many many times -- is this an assumption? So all in all, there seems to be many assumptions in probability. So when does the theory start and end? EDIT: I've read a bit more about this issue and found that the reason why probability spaces give the same answer is likely due to them being extensions of each other. Terence Tao wrote about this once and if I'm not mistaken, the extension he talks about essentially shows the equivalence of the first 3 probability spaces I mentioned. Is this correct? According to this, independence should then be preserved under extension, so it doesn't make sense that independence ($P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$) doesn't work under probability space 2 but works under 1. What I'm thinking might be the resolution is that when we state that ""the results of some coin tosses are mutually independent"", we are assuming that every single one of these independent coin tosses are performed in every single outcome . So in probability space 2, even though an outcome string might be of finite length, we assume that the other infinitely many coin tosses have also been performed (although their results are irrelevant for this outcome). Is this way of thinking correct? But now it seems strange that $P(\text{the $100$-th coin is heads}) = 0.5$, since after all the $100$-th coin is only tossed in the event that the $99$ coins before it do not contain consecutive heads. What is wrong here?","['probability-theory', 'axioms', 'independence', 'probability', 'mathematical-modeling']"
