956440,Linear combinations of indicator functions of measurable rectangles with sides of finite measure.,"The following is a question on measure theory whose answer would help me greatly in my research. Let $ (X,\mathcal{F},\mu) $ and $ (Y,\mathcal{G},\nu) $ be $ \sigma $ -finite measure spaces. Let $ E $ be a $ (\mathcal{F} \otimes \mathcal{G}) $ -measurable subset of $ X \times Y $ such that $ (\mu \otimes \nu)(E) < \infty $ . Is it true that the indicator function $ \mathbf{1}_{E} $ is the pointwise limit of a sequence $ (s_{n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}} $ of functions on $ X \times Y $ , where for each $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ , we require that $ s_{n} $ be a finite linear combination of functions of the form $ \mathbf{1}_{A \times B} $ , where $ A \in \mathcal{F} $ , $ B \in \mathcal{G} $ and $ \mu(A),\nu(B) < \infty $ ? In other words, for each $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ , we require that $ s_{n} $ be a finite linear combination of indicator functions of measurable rectangles whose sides have finite measure.

956595,Prove that no finite abelian group is divisible.,"A nontrivial abelian group $G$ is called divisible if for each $a \in G$ and each nonzero integer $k$ there exists an element $x \in G$ such that $x^k=a$. Prove that no finite abelian group is divisible. I came across a prove that goes like this: Let $G$ be a finite divisible abelian group. Then for each positive integer $k$ there is $x_k \in G$ such that $x_k^k = 1$. Note we may assume $x_k$ is minimal with respect to this property; i.e. the order of $x_k$ is $k$. Therefore, $G$ contains an element of every positive order and these must be distinct. Contradiction. How can we assume $x_k$ has order $k$? If $G$ is finite of order $n$, then we must have $ord(x)|n$ for each $x \in G$. If $n<k$ then there is no $x\in G$ with order $k$. Right?

956614,Is there a codifferential for a covariant exterior derivative?,"For forms on a Riemannian $n$-manifold $(M,g)$ there is a notion of a codifferential $\delta$, which is adjoint to the exterior derivative: $$\int \langle d \alpha, \beta \rangle \operatorname{vol} = \int \langle \alpha, \delta \beta \rangle \operatorname{vol} $$ $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$ is a scalar product of two differential forms induced by $g$, $\operatorname{vol}$ is a volume form, corresponding to $g$. Moreover, $\delta$ is defined through a Hodge star $*$ and exterior derivative $d$: $$
  \delta : \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k-1}(M) \\
  \delta = (-1)^{n(k+1)+1}*d*
$$ But since $M$ is Riemannian, $d$ can be extended with a Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ to an exterior covariant derivative $d^\nabla$ to act on tensor-valued differential forms. Is there such a codifferential for $d^\nabla$ in such case, when scalar product of tensor-valued forms is considered? Is there an analogue of Hodge decomposition?

956675,Computing Images of Varieties,"Somehow, this problem has been coming up a lot lately in different guises, which I'm taking as a sign that I ought to stop avoiding computational algebraic geometry.  I could probably dig this up in one of my textbooks, but I thought I might get a more diverse perspective here, and somehow I couldn't find it in the archive. Given an irreducible curve $C\subset\mathbb{A}^2$ and a rational map $\varphi:\mathbb{A}^2\to \mathbb{A}^2$ with nontrivial image, is there a standard way to give an equation for $\overline{\varphi(C)}$? Here is a more concrete version of the question: Given an irreducible, non-constant polynomial $P\in \mathbb{C}[X,Y]$, and rational functions $f,g\in \mathbb{C}(X,Y)$, how to compute an irreducible polynomial $Q$ such that, for all $a,b\in \mathbb{C}$, $P(a,b)=0 \implies Q(f(a,b),g(a,b)) = 0$? I am assuming here that the image of an irreducible curve is either a single point, or a closed, irreducible curve with finitely many points missing.  Since I'm specifying rational maps, technically the image could be empty—but I have a feeling I can do that case by hand.  Anyway, the point is that I've tried to avoid pathologies in the question setup, but let me know if I failed to do so, and please tell me what I should have asked instead. I would think there is some formulaic way to do this particular case (if we fix the degree, there should exist a polynomial expression in the coefficients of $P,f,g$ for the answer... right?), but I'm also interested in the more general question: What's a good way to compute images of affine or projective varieties?  I have no doubt that the answer involves a software package, but I'm especially interested in ones that I can pick up easily, since my interest in this sort of heavy computation is still very casual.

Having multiple $\mathbb{R}^2$ spaces that has a finite size k but acts like as if extending to infinity (see point b) sewed together b . Has a weird property that for each trip wrt a parameter (e.g. time) if each distance of travel $D_i$ exceed a certain value k, you will hop to the corresponding location of the neighboring patch of $\mathbb{R}^2$ plus moving in this new patch by a distance $D \hspace{1mm}mod\hspace{1mm}k$. If your distance of travel for any of the trips does not exceed k, then no matter how far you travel, you will still be travelling within the same patch and never reach the edge of it Using an example, (letting the parameter be time) property b is basically saying that you only jump to neighbouring patches (and travelling the remainder of it after dividing k) if your velocity exceed the threshold k (the size of the patch), otherwise you will only be moving within a single patch forever, even if the total distance traveled exceed k An attempt to formulate the above descriptions mathematically: Question: Is there a class of mathematical spaces that has similar properties as described below or a more generalized version of it? a. For the case of $\mathbb{R}^2$, each patch is a $\mathbb{R}^2$ space and is described by ordered pair of integers $(p_{1},p_{2})$. Let $(0,0)$ be the central patch. Therefore every point $P_{x}$ in the space can be described by $(p_{x1},p_{x2},x_1,x_2)$ and the separation $S_{xy}$ between points is described by $(\Delta p_{x1y1},\Delta p_{x2y2},\Delta x_1y_1,\Delta x_2y_2)$ where $$\Delta x_jy_j=y_j-x_j,j=1,2$$ $$\Delta p_{x_jy_j}=p_{y_j}-p_{x_j},j=1,2$$ Let a path $\mathit{\lambda}$ connecting from $P_x$ to $P_z$ (both points are located on the same patch). $P_x'$ be the actual destination. $D$ is the total distance of the path $\mathit{\lambda}$ which is the sum of the distances of i trips (shorter partitions of the path i.e. $\lambda_i$), $$D=\sum_{i=0}^nD_i,D \geq D_i$$ where $D_i$ is defined as the usual Euclidean distance between two neighbouring points in each partition $$D_i=\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^2\left(x_{(i+1)j}-x_{ij}\right)^2}$$ Let $d$ be the Euclidean separation between $P_x$ and $P_z$ defined as $$d=\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^2\left(z_j-x_j\right)^2}$$ b.

There is no doubt that knowing such a resolution is very useful in practice since it allows us to compute many invariants of $M$, such as homology groups, the rank of $M$, Betti numbers in the local case, or the Hilbert polynomial in the graded case. More generally, we can compute any invariant which is easily determined for free modules and behaves well under exact sequences. While this all is clear for me, I am not able to explain the usefulness of finite free resolutions at an elementary level. Of course it always contains a finite presentation $F_1 \to F_0 \to M \to 0$ which I can motivate: With this data we are able to describe all elements of $M$ and to prove any equation which holds in $M$. In short: a finite presentation allows us to do calculations in $M$. But this explanation creates the impression that a finite presentation is all we need to understand the module $M$, doesn't it? Are there elementary reasons why we should be interested in higher syzygies? Maybe this is a related question: What were the historical reasons to consider free resolutions?

957166,Martingale Can't be Strictly Increasing,"If the sample paths of a martingale are almost surely continuous and not constant on any interval, is it true that they are almost surely not increasing on any interval? Edit for clarity: Let $(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ be a continuous martingale that is not constant on any interval. Show that, almost surely, it cannot be strictly increasing on any interval. That is, there exists no $A \in \mathcal{F}$, $\mathbb{P}(A)>0$, such that $$[a,b] \ni t \mapsto X_t(\omega)$$ is strictly increasing for all $\omega \in A$, i.e. $X_t>X_s$ for $t>s\in[a,b]$. I know that if a martingale is continuous and not constant on any interval, it has unbounded variation over every interval, which implies the result. But it seems that not increasing on any interval is a more natural result of the martingale property, so there should be a more direct way to show this. Is there a way without making reference to the total variation? All I can conclude so far is in the case where the increments $I_k=X_{1-2^{-k+1}}-X_{1-2^{-k}}$ are independent we have $\mathbb{P}(\forall k,I_k>0)=\prod_k\mathbb{P}(I_k>0)$. If there is a uniform bound $1>B>\mathbb{P}(I_k>0)>0$ then $\mathbb{P}(\forall k,I_k>0)=0$, so $X_t$  is almost surely not strictly increasing over $[0,1]$.","['probability-theory', 'stochastic-processes', 'martingales']"

A remark in the book Infinite Dimensional Analysis of Aliprantis says that this definitions are equals in the $\sigma$-finite case, but may be different in other cases (page 411). This is quite surprising for me as my intuition says that this cannot happen because the integral has a naive definition as the measure of the set under the function. Therefore every definition of the integral should satisfy $\int f d\mu = \mu \times \lambda (\{(x,y);0\leq f(x) \leq y \})$ were $\mu \times \lambda$ is the measure of the product space (and I think that a function should be integrable if and only if $\{(x,y);0\leq f(x) \leq y \}$ is measurable).

957188,"How can one handle very large numbers such as ${1,000,000 \choose 500,000}$ using binomial formula and very tiny numbers such as $0.5^{1,000,000}$?","For a problem such as what is the probability of getting exactly $500,000$ heads out of $1,000,000$ (1 million) fair coin flips, we get one huge valued number and one tiny valued number as intermediate results, both of which are not able to be computed with many online tools such as combination calculators and other online calculators. I think the correct answer to this is ${1,000,000 \choose 500,000}$ * $0.5^{1,000,000}$. So my question is, if someone wanted to know this approximate probability in decimal form, how would they compute it?  Is there any ""shortcut""?  For example, we know that ${1,000,000 \choose 500,000}$ is $1,000,000 * 999,999 * ... 500,001$ / $500,000$! so we know we can keep the intermediate or accumulated result from becoming super large or super small and thus ""blowing up"".  We also know that there are $500,000$ terms that make up the numerator and ditto for the denominator, however there are $1,000,000$ powers of $0.5$ we need to multiply by so we can further ""simplify"" (or manipulate) that to be $500,000$ powers of $0.5^2$ which is $0.25 ^ {500,000}$.  So to me it would make sense for a combination calculator to know these ""tricks"" and use them to it's advantage so the result can actually be computed.  I see so many online combination calculators that cannot compute this expression.  Instead it tells me $infinity$ or Nan (not a number).  What it really means is their utility just blew a chunk and they are putting the ""blame"" on me that I did something wrong. So for example, if I made a combination calculator for this problem, The first subterm, (out of $500,000$ of them), I would get would be ($1,000,000$ / $500,000$) * $0.25$ = $0.5$.  The 2nd subterm would be $999,999$ / $499,999$ * $0.25$ = $0.500000500001000002000004000008$ and so on. The last ($500,000$th) subterm would be $500,001$ / $1$ * $0.25$ = $125,000.25$. At that point I would have the final answer since I'd be accumulating the intermediate results. I also get a similar problem when trying to compute $0.5 ^ {1,000,000}$ so it seems like someone needs to write a better combination calculator to handle problems like this.","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

The proof goes on to say that if $n>k^22^{k+1}$, then $n^ke^{-n/2^k}<1$, but I am not sure how to derive this bound on $n$? I have that
$$\begin{align*}
n^ke^{-n/2^k}&<1\\

If $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is a monotone function (say, non-decreasing), does there exist a sequence of continuous functions $f_n:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ converging pointwise to $f$? Here's the motivation for those questions: Let $(X,M)$ and $(Y,N)$ be measure spaces. It's known that if $\mu$ is a measure on $(X,M)$ and $f:X\to Y$ is measure, then we have the pushforward measure $f_*\mu(A)=\mu(f^{-1}(A))$ on $(Y,N)$. What if we were to define a ""pullback measure""? Given a function $f:X\to Y$ such that $f(M)\subseteq N$ (i.e. $f$ maps measurable sets to measurable sets) and a measure $\nu$ on $N$, the natural formula would be $f^*\nu(A)=\nu(f(A))$. So we ask if is there a good amount of functions which map measurable sets to measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}$, and monotone functions seem like good candidates (for strictly monotone, continuous functions, the result is valid and there are several answers on the web). If this were true, maybe we could use some convergence argument to solve the problem above.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis']"

957657,Why are the trigonometric functions so important?,"The basic functions of trigonometry, $\sin$ and $\cos$, are ubiquitous in mathematics. They were originally conceived from geometry, and so it's not surprising that they consistently show up in elementary geometry contexts. Many other appearances of these functions I find shocking, though. We have of course the famous result, $$e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x,$$ which connects them to exponentiation. They also appear in relation to other famous functions, such as in the formulas $$\Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z)=\frac{\pi}{\sin \pi z},$$ $$\zeta(s) = 2^s \pi^{s-1}\sin\left( \frac{\pi s}{2}\right)\Gamma(1-s)\zeta(1-s). \tag{1}$$ I find these particularly surprising because the Riemann zeta function is closely tied to prime numbers, for example in the formula $$\zeta(s) = \prod_{p\ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1-1/p^s} \tag{2}.$$ If I had never heard of trigonometry, and you defined $\sin$ and $\cos$ for me in terms of the unit circle (ignoring non-real values of $s$), and then told me that the expressions in $(1)$ and $(2)$ are equivalent, I'd probably call you a lying idiot! Many proofs of the solution to the Basel problem, that $\zeta(2) = \pi^2/6$, depend heavily on using properties of $\sin$ and $\cos$, which I also find remarkable. The problem of evaluating the sum $$\zeta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}$$ seems to have very little to do with $\sin$ and $\cos$, ratios of lengths of triangles, points on the unit circle, and so forth. Even just the Taylor series $$\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots, $$ $$\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots,$$ are shockingly simple, and connect these functions to problems in analysis (and from there to problems in number theory and other fields). I could prattle on for much longer about other uses of $\sin$ and $\cos$, such as in Fourier Analysis, integration, differential equations, analytic number theory,  and even (in subtler ways) in proofs of results such as the fundamental theorem of algebra. How can we intuitively understand this? That functions considered thousands of years ago have shown up again and again in the mathematics of the past few hundred years, in fields completely unrelated to their original use and totally foreign to the people who created them, I find absolutely astonishing. Why have these ancient functions continued to be amazingly useful in mathematics, with essentially no changes being made to their original definitions?

I tried to select transcendence bases for $\quot(R_1)$ and $\quot(R_2)$ over $\mathbb C$ and then to show that their union will be a transcendence basis for $\quot(R_3)$. But unfortunately I don't see how to show the algebraic independence and the generating property for this union of bases. Maybe my approach is incorrect and there is some other way to show the desired equality? P.S. The equality in the question implies that the dimension of the product of algebraic varieties is the sum of their dimensions since the dimension can be defined as the transcendence degree of the functions field over $\mathbb C$. Update. As Georges Elencwajg wrote in his answer and comments below, $R_3 = R_1 \otimes_{\mathbb C} R_2$ and 
$$\quot(R_3) = \quot(\quot(R_1)\otimes_{\mathbb C} \quot(R_2)).$$ So it sufficient to show that for transcendental extensions $F_1$ and $F_2$ of $\mathbb C$ we have 
$$\tr\deg \quot(F_1 \otimes_{\mathbb C} F_2) = \tr\deg F_1 + \tr\deg F_2.$$

957938,Simple Example of Method of Characteristics,"To find the general solution of an equation such as $u_{x} - yu_{y} = 0$, it is clear by the method of characteristics that the characteristic curves satisfy $dx = -\frac{dy}{y}$ and so we get the relation that $u$ depends only on the constant $k = ye^{x}$ on these curves. It seems to me that it is more useful (for nonhomogeneous problems) to approach this by parametrizing the curve with respect to a new variable. I want to get comfortable with such an approach, but I'm not sure how to proceed. Here is what I tried: By parametrizing the curve with respect to a new variable $t$, I want to solve this problem through the system of equations: \begin{cases}
\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = -y \\
\frac{dz}{dt} = 0
\end{cases} giving me a curve $(x(t), y(t), z(t))$ with $x(t) = t + c_{1}$, $y(t) = c_{2}e^{-t}$, and $z(t) = c_{3}$ for some constants. By redefining new constants, I can identify $x$ with $t$ and substitute it into the expression for $y(t)$. At this point, I'm wondering what I do next to infer that $u$ is constant on these curves and depends only on the constant $k = ye^{x}$?","['ordinary-differential-equations', 'partial-differential-equations']"
957940,"Choice Problem: choose 5 days in a month, consecutive days are forbidden [duplicate]","This question already has answers here : How many ways can $r$ nonconsecutive integers be chosen from the first $n$ integers? (4 answers) Closed 8 years ago . I'm ""walking"" through the book ""A walk through combinatorics"" and stumbled on an example I don't understand. Example 3.19. A medical student has to work in a hospital for five
  days in January. However, he is not allowed to work two consecutive
  days in the hospital. In how many different ways can he choose the
  five days he will work in the hospital? Solution . The difficulty here is to make sure that we do not choose two consecutive days. This can be assured by the following
  trick. Let $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ be the dates of the five days of
  January that the student will spend in the hospital, in increasing
  order. Note that the requirement that there are no two consecutive
  numbers among the $a_i$, and $1 \le a_i \le 31$ for all $i$ is equivalent
  to the requirement that $1 \le a_i < a_2 — 1 < a_3 — 2 < a_4 — 3 < a_5 — 4 \le 27$. In other words, there is an obvious bijection between the
  set of 5-element subsets of [31] containing no two consecutive
  elements and the set of 5-element subsets of [27]. *** Instead of choosing the numbers $a_i$, we can choose the numbers $1 \le a_i < a_2 — 1 < a_3 — 2 < a_4 — 3 < a_5 — 4 \le 27$, that is, we can
  simply choose a five-element subset of [27], and we know that there
  are $\binom{27}{5}$ ways to do that. What I don't understand here $1 \le a_i < a_2 — 1 < a_3 — 2 < a_4 — 3 < a_5 — 4 \le 27$: Why do the subtracting numbers increment with every other $a_i$? Why 27? And the very last sentence (***) is unclear to me. Why is there no talk about ""non-consecutive""? Why choosing 5 elements of 27 is equivalent to choosing 5 non-consecutive elements out of 31? I miss the connection. I'd be very thankful if you could help me to understand this example!","['binomial-coefficients', 'combinatorics']"

958193,Infinite product of probability measures is a premeasure,"This is an exercise from Real Analysis by Stein and Shakarchi (Chapter 6, Exercise 15). Given infinitely many measure spaces $(X_i, \mathcal M_i, m_i)$, each of which has measure 1, one can define an algebra on the product space consisting of all finite unions of the “cylinders”, by which we mean rectangles of the form $E_1 \times E_2 \times \cdots$, where $E_i$ belong to $\mathcal M_i$ and all but finitely many of $E_i$ are equal to $X_i$. Then define $m(E_1 \times E_2 \times \cdots) = m_1(E_1)\,m_2(E_2)\cdots$. How does one prove that $m$ is a premeasure on the algebra defined above? One only needs to check the equality in the definition of premeasure, but it seems a subtle problem of the exchange of summation and limit progress is involved, which can be easily ignored without carefulness.

I've evaluated with Maple $F(i,j,1,1)$ for all $(i,j)$ for $0 \leq i <j$, $0 < j \leq 4$. Maple could solve them in term of digamma functions, so I guess that there is a general closed-form.
