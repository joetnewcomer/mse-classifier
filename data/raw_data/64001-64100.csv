739750,Textbook proof for uniqueness of inverse in a group,"A Textbook of Abstract Algebra by Pinter gives the following proof of the property that an element in a group can have only one inverse (consider $*$ to be the operation and $e$ to be the identity element): Suppose an element $a$ has two inverses, $a_1$ and $a_2$ . Then, $a_1*(a*a_2) = a_1*e = a_1$ , and ( $a_1*a)*a_2 = e*a_2 = a_2$ The book then says by associativity, the two-left hand sides are equal, and hence so are $a_1$ and $a_2$ . I have an objection to this proof. The identity element is defined as $a*e=a$ , and since commutativity is not necessary in a group, the argument that $e*a_2 = a_2$ doesn't look watertight to me. Any comments?","['group-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

Show using the implicit function theorem that this equation sets in the neighborhood of $(1,0,1)$ $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ and find: $\frac{dz}{dx},\frac{dz}{dy},\frac{d^2z}{dxdy}$ where $x=1$ and $y=0$ My answer: Define $F(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2-z^2+xz-yz-1$. Notice that $F(1,0,1)=0$. $F_x=2x+z$ , $F_y=2y-z$ , $F_z=-2z+x-y$ are all continouos functions, and $F$ itself is continuous as well, and as such $F \in C^1$. Also notice that $F_z(1,0,1)=-1 \neq 0$ and so $F_z$ is invertible at that point, and according to IFT, we can represent $z=z(x,y)$ as a function of $x$ and $y$ around that point. Now where I am having difficulties. if you look at an earlier question I asked Question about Implicit function theorem I tried deriving like I did then, and it does not work. If i was to do the same thing: $$\frac{dz}{dx} = -\frac{F_x}{F_z} = -\frac{2x+z}{x-y-2z}$$ I didn't get rid of the $z$. and the question only said $x=1$ and $y=0$.

740020,Questions related to intersections of open sets and Baire spaces,"EDIT: I have reposted this question on MathOverflow. (The version posted there is more concise, with some details omitted. I have also added a question about pseudobases with similar property.) MO copy: Intersections of open sets and $\alpha$ -favorable spaces I was curious a little about the classes of topological spaces described below. For each of them I want to ask whether they have been studied and whether they have some interesting properties. (Although I do not think that they are going to be particularly useful, since all these properties seem to be more natural if the intersections of open sets in the definitions below are replaced by intersections of their closures.) For the purpose of this post I have made up some names for these classes of spaces. I know that my question is a little vague - I am basically asking whether these classes were studied somewhere, what are they called (if they have a name) and whether they have some interesting properties; although it is rather subjective what can be considered interesting. Below I will try to write down what I was able to find out by myself and I will also try to give some motivation for the question. Question 1. What is name/characterization of spaces such that $\bigcap \mathcal F\ne\emptyset$ for every open ultrafilter $\mathcal F$ . Let us call such spaces u.i.-spaces . (Where ""u.i."" stands for ultrafilter intersection). 1 Question 2 . What is name/characterization of spaces such that $\bigcap \mathcal F\ne\emptyset$ for every open filter $\mathcal F$ . Let us call such spaces f.i.-spaces . (Where ""f.i."" stands for filter intersection). I will try to show below that the conditions f.i. and u.i. are in fact equivalent. And I will also give a reformulation, which is more similar to the conditions in the following two questions. (I hope I have not made a mistake in the proof below.) But the above formulation is closer to the result from [HM], which motivated me to ask about these spaces, so I have kept this formulation. I was able to find some papers, where this class of spaces is mentioned. Question 3 . What about the spaces with this property: For any countable system of non-empty open sets $\{U_n; n=1,2,3,\dots\}$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2\supseteq U_3\supseteq \dots$ , the intersection $\bigcap U_n\ne\emptyset$ . Let us call such spaces c.o.i. spaces . (Where ""c.o.i."" stands for countable open intersection). Question 4 . What is name/characterization of topological spaces with this property: $X$ has a base $\mathcal B$ such that for any countable system of sets $U_n\in\mathcal B$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2\supseteq U_3\supseteq \dots$ , the intersection $\bigcap U_n\ne\emptyset$ . Let us call such spaces c.b.i. spaces . (Where ""c.b.i."" stands for countable basic intersection). All these classes seem to be related to Baire spaces somehow. The reason why I wondered what can be said about these classes of spaces was the result that u.i. spaces are Baire spaces, which I mention below. Some basic observations Reformulation using closed covers. It is clear that in the definition of c.o.i. space we can replace decreasing countable family of non-empty open sets by a countable family of open sets with finite intersection property. By a standard argument we see that this is equivalent to: Every countable cover of $X$ by closed sets has a finite subcover. Equivalence of f.i. and u.i. Similar condition for all closed covers (not only countable ones) was discussed a little in one of the answers to this question: Terminologies related to ""compact?"" It seems that some authors call such spaces strongly S-closed spaces . In [D, Theorem 3.3] it is shown that an equivalent characterization is that there exists a finite dense subset in this space. Again, using the standard argument (taking complements, similarly as for compact spaces) we get that this condition is equivalent to: Every system of open sets which has finite intersection property has non-empty intersection. I'll try to show that the following three conditions are equivalent: (a) Every system of open subsets of $X$ which has finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection. (b) Every open filter on $X$ has a non-empty intersection. (c) Every open ultrafilter on $X$ has a non-empty intersection. By definition, an open filter has f.i.p. Hence (a) $\Rightarrow$ (b). It is clear that (b) $\Rightarrow$ (c). $\boxed{\text{(c)}\Rightarrow\text{(a)}}$ If $\mathscr S$ is a system of open sets with f.i.p. then (by Zorn lemma) there exists an open ultrafilter $\mathscr F\supseteq\mathscr S$ . Since $\mathscr F$ has non-empty intersection, so does $\mathscr S$ . So we get that the notions of u.i. spaces and f.i. spaces are equivalent to the notion of strongly S-closed spaces. (Which basically answers my first two questions. But I am still keeping these two questions in my post - it is still possible that I have made a mistake in my proof, and also it is still possible that this class of spaces was studied under a different name or someone will be able to contribute some other interesting facts about such spaces.) As pointed out in a (now deleted) comment by Niels Diepeveen , $T_1$ -spaces have this property if and only if they are finite. (Closed cover by singletons has to have a finite subcover.) c.o.i. and c.b.i. are not equivalent conditions. As an example we can take an infinite discrete space. The base consisting of all singletons has the property described above. So far we see that f.i $\Leftrightarrow$ u.i. $\Rightarrow$ c.o.i $\Rightarrow$ c.b.i. Background, motivation, related notions u.i.-spaces are Baire spaces. These classes of spaces caught my attention after I have seen the following result 2 , which says that every u.i.-space is Baire: Proposition. If there are no free open ultrafilters on a space $X$ , then $X$ is a Baire space . After seeing this result I asked myself what the spaces where this condition is fulfilled look like. (It seems a reasonable question to ask about spaces fulfilling the assumptions of a result you see published somewhere.) c.b.i. spaces are $\alpha$ -favorable. The classes of c.o.i. and c.b.i. are also related to Baire spaces. It can be shown that in c.b.i. the second player has a winning tactic for Choquet game. Choquet game can be used to characterize Baire spaces, they are precisely the spaces where the first player does not have a winning strategy 3 (or, equivalently, the first player does not have a winning tactic 4 ). It is relatively easy to see that every c.b.i. space is $\alpha$ -favorable. (And every $\alpha$ -favorable space is a Baire space.) The tactic (stationary strategy) for the second player in Choquet game is easily obtained using the base with the c.b.i. property. If the first player plays some non-empty open sets $V_i$ , the second player can choose a non-empty basic sets $U_i\subseteq V_i$ . The property of the base $\mathcal B$ formulated in the definition of c.b.i. space implies that second player always wins, if he plays in this way. Some other related properties. Some similar properties are studied if we require non-empty intersection of closures of the open sets from a filter/countable decreasing system. The spaces such that $\bigcap_{U\in\mathscr F} \overline U\ne\emptyset$ for each open filter $\mathscr F$ are called generalized absolutely closed spaces or almost compact spaces . If we add $T_2$ , we get precisely H-minimal spaces. A space which is quasi-regular has a base $\mathcal B$ such that $\bigcap_{U\in\mathcal U} \overline U\ne\emptyset$ for any countable system $\mathcal U\subseteq\mathcal B$ with finite intersection property is called countably base compact . (Although this property does not seem to appear too often , more references can be found for base compact spaces , where the countability condition is omitted.) The extension $sX$ . One of the spaces studied in [HM, Section IV.2] is the space called $sX$ , which is constructed from $X$ as follows: We add to $X$ as new points the set $F$ of all open ultrafilters, that are generated by countable systems of open sets $\{U_n; n=1,2,\dots\}$ such that $U_1\supseteq U_2 \supseteq \dots$ and $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i=\emptyset$ . We take the topology given by the base consisting of sets $U^*=U\cup\{\mathfrak F\in F; U\in\mathfrak F\}$ . It is shown that $sX$ is a Baire space which contains $X$ as a dense subspace and also some other results about this space are mentioned there. Clearly a space $X$ is an c.o.i. space if and only if $sX=X$ . (But this is more of a reformulation than a characterization.) The reasons I am mentioning $sX$ is that it is an example of a c.b.i. space. (And so are some other extensions mentioned in that chapter.) Suppose we have basic sets $U_1^*\supseteq U_2^* \supseteq U_3 \supseteq \dots$ . We can assume that $U_1\supseteq U_2 \supseteq U_3 \supseteq \dots$ . (If not, we simply take $U_n' = \bigcap_{k=1}^n U_k$ . This does not change the decreasing system of basic sets, since $(U\cap V)^*=U^*\cap V^*$ and the same is true for any finite intersection.) Then there are two possibilities. If $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i\ne\emptyset$ , then also the intersection $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i^*$ is non-empty. On the other hand, if $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i=\emptyset$ , then the filter $\mathfrak F$ generated by $\{U_i; i=1,2,\dots\}$ is a point of $sX$ which belongs to $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^\infty U_i^*$ .

I.e., the definition is almost the same as definition of filters, with the exception that we are working only with open sets. Open ultrafilters are defined as maximal open filters. Using Zorn Lemma we can show that any system of open sets, which has finite intersection property, is contained in an open ultrafilter. 2 for example [M,Theorem 1], [HM,Proposition 4.13] 3 See, for example, [K,Theorem 8.11] or The Banach-Mazur Game at Dan Ma's topology blog. 4 I thought that the proof of [K, Theorem 8.11] in fact yields the same result for stationary strategy (instead of strategy). Now I have noticed that this is not true. As I do not know whether the equivalence of these two conditions is true, I have removed the part about winning tactic.

My approach has been to try and show that  $\frac{b_{k+1}}{b_{k}} <1$ My best attempt has been: $\frac{b_{k+1}}{b_{k}} = (\frac{k+2}{k+1})(\frac{(k+1)^2-1}{(k+1)^2})(\frac{(k+1)^2-1}{(k+1)^2})^k$ I'm not worried about the last part $(\frac{(k+1)^2-1}{(k+1)^2})^k$, as it is clearly < 1, and $(\frac{(k+1)^2-1}{(k+1)^2})$ is also < 1, but $(\frac{k+2}{k+1})$ is clearly > 1, so I am having trouble combining this last term with $(\frac{(k+1)^2-1}{(k+1)^2})$, to try and get something that is clearly < 1. I've also tried to use induction on $k$, but it just gets quite messy and nothing obvious sticks out. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

(Although it's clear that the index $k$ is required to be the same for both terms.

740355,dual of $H^1_0$: $H^{-1}$ or $H_0^1$?,"I have a problem related to dual of Sobolev space $H^1_0$. By definition, the dual of $H^1_0$ is $H^{-1}$, which contains $L^2$ as a subspace. However, from Riesz representation theorem, dual of a Hilbert space is itself (in the sense of isomorphism). It seems that this implies dual of $H^1_0$ is $H^1_0$ itself. From the result, I think the latter argument is not right. But where's the mistake? This problem may related to the question about Hilbert space and its dual A paradox on Hilbert spaces and their duals However I couldn't understand the answers well after reading several times... Thanks so much! Thanks a lot for all the kind solutions! The following are my conclusions: Dual space strongly depends on action we take. For example, in our case, if we take $H^1$ inner product, the dual space is $H_0^1$ itself; if taking $L^2$ inner product, the dual space is larger than $L^2$; and taking all possible dual actions, the dual is by definition $H^{-1}$. As dual of one space, there are certainly identifications between these spaces. Notice that identification between infinite dimensional spaces can be bijective and ISOMETRIC! Indeed there is a simple example: sequence {1,2,3...} and {2,4,6...}. Just taking metric of the latter to be half. Another basic example is simple elliptic equation in $H_0^1$:
$$
\int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot \nabla v+\int_\Omega uv=\langle f,v\rangle , \forall v\in H_0^1(\Omega)
$$
where $f\in H^{-1}$. This gives isometric identification of $H^{-1}$ and $H_0^1$.

740414,Constructing Riemann surfaces,"At the risk of asking a question that has been already answered, I have been trying to figure out how to construct the Riemann surface of slightly more complicated examples, but after reading examples in Alfors; Churchill and Brown; Gamelin; Silverman and several existing examples here, I feel like I have a good intuition of examples such as $w=\sqrt[n]{z}$ or the logarithm, but I am unable to take that understanding and go much further. For example, I would like to try to find a Riemann surface with an intersecting branch cut. It seems like a nice way to do this is to take a function like $$f(z) = \sqrt[4]{(z-1)(z+1)(z-i)(z+i)}.$$ From my perspective, $f(z)$ is a four-valued function everywhere except the points $z=1,-1,i,-i,\infty$ where it is only a single valued function. As such, I would need four sheets and from there my ability to go further promptly falls flat on its face. I have a very strong inclination to construct my branch cut as a ""+"" shape connecting the four points $i,-i,1,-1$ respectively, but this seems like a poor choice for a few reasons: I am defining a branch cut between -1 and 1, then another cut running between -i and i. The intersection seems bad to me, but I cannot justify whether or not it truly matters. If I do this, it seems like we can traverse from any of the four sheets by passing through the origin. In that sense, if I define my branch cuts in this manner, I think I am introducing a new point where $f$ is four-valued at the origin. I think in that case, I have to then run a third branch cut connecting the origin to the point at infinity. If I make this choice, I have no clue how to actually begin the gluing process for my sheets. It seems like a smarter way might be to define four rays originating at the four points $i,-i,1,-1$ and sending them each off to infinity. But to remark on item 3 again, even if I do that I am not quite sure how to align these cuts (also I am not sure if we can choose our branch cut so that this makes sense). In the case of this four ray choice I just described,  I think I have two options: Construct glue my sheets such that starting on sheet #1, going around any of the points $1,-1,i,-i$ in a closed positively oriented curve will always take me to sheet 2, then sheet 3, then sheet 4. While going in the opposite orientation takes me to sheet 4, then 3, then 2 then 1. That is, from sheet #1, I can only travel to sheet 2 or 4, but I cannot skip to sheet 3 without traversing through 2 or 4 (but then what happens when I try to make a closed curve through the point at infinity?). Alternatively, it seems like it might be possible to glue the sheets in such a way that I can traverse from sheet 1 to any of the 3 remaining sheets without visiting a different sheet to get there. This motivates why I chose the four root as my example of interest: In the case of a cubic root, we can always traverse from one sheet to another without visiting any intermediary sheets. Finally, using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, $$2-2g^{\prime} = n(2-2g)-\sum_{P}(e_{p}-1)$$ is causing me issues because it is not obvious to me how to determine the value of $g$. I think in the case of a complex plane, this value of $g$ must always be zero since we just have an complex plane which has no ""holes"".","['riemann-surfaces', 'manifolds', 'complex-analysis']"

If the characteristics of $F$ is $p \neq 0$ then $f(x)$ has multiple roots if it is of form $f(x)=f(x^p)$. In my book, For the first one, since if $f(x)$ has multiple root, then $f'(x)$ and $f(x)$ have non trivial common root. Thus $f(x)|f'(x)$  which forces $f'(x) = 0$ or $f(x) $ is constant. My question is how come $f(x)|f'(x)$ if they have common factor? shouldn't there be some irreducible factor of $f(x)$ that remains at denominator?

740681,Questions about the proof of generalized Poisson summation formula.,"The generalized Poisson summation formula is 
$$
\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f(\gamma) = \sum_{ \pi \in \widehat{\Gamma \backslash G}} \hat{f}(\pi),
$$
where $G$ is a locally compact Abelian group, $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $G$, $f$ is some function on $G$, $\widehat{\Gamma \backslash G}$ is the set of all unitary character of $\Gamma \backslash G$,
$$
\hat{f}(\pi) = \int_G f(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx
$$
is the Fourier transform. If $G=\mathbb{R}$, $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}$, then we obtain the usual Poisson summation formula. The following is the proof of the generalized Poisson summation formula. Let 
$$
F(x)=\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f(\gamma x).
$$
Then we have Fourier expansion
$$
F(x) = \sum_{\pi \in \widehat{\Gamma \backslash G}} c(\pi)\pi(x),
$$
$c(\pi)$ are Fourier coefficients. We have
$$
c(\pi) = \int_{\Gamma \backslash G} F(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx \\
= \int_G f(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx \\
= \hat{f}(\pi)
$$
Therefore 
$$
\sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma}f(\gamma x) = F(x) = \sum_{\pi \in \widehat{\Gamma \backslash G}} \hat{f}(\pi)\pi(x).
$$
The generalized Poisson formula is proved. My question is: how to prove the equality
$$
\int_{\Gamma \backslash G} F(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx = \int_G f(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx?
$$ I think that 
$$
\int_{\Gamma \backslash G} F(x)\pi^{-1}(x)dx \\
= \int_{\Gamma \backslash G} \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f(\gamma x)\pi^{-1}(x) dx \\
= \int_{\Gamma \backslash G} \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f( x)\pi^{-1}( \gamma^{-1} x) d(\gamma^{-1}x).
$$
Do we have $$
\int_{\Gamma \backslash G} \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f( x)\pi^{-1}( \gamma^{-1} x) d(\gamma^{-1}x) = \int_{\Gamma \backslash G} \sum_{\gamma \in \Gamma} f( x)\pi^{-1}(   x) dx = \int_{\Gamma \backslash G}  f( x)\pi^{-1}(   x) dx ?

741309,Do I use the Standard Deviation of my sample or the population to find the standard error.,"A professor is interested in determining if attending college influences the level at which an 
individual cooperates with the police. The professor is unsure if attending college will teach 
respect for authority and thus increase level of cooperation or if college will teach 
independent thinking and thus lead to deceased level of cooperation. To address this 
question, the professor gathers information from the students in an undergraduate course 
and calculates their propensity for cooperating with the police (higher number means higher 
level of cooperation) and compares it to the known mean and standard deviation of the 
general population. a) Would the professor conduct a 1-tailed or 2-tailed hypothesis test? Explain why. b) Use the information below to conduct a z-test using p=.05 as your alpha level. Make 
sure you complete all 5 steps and show your work/answers for each step. Population: Mean = 3.02 SD = 0.54 Sample: Mean = 3.13 SD = 0.53 n = 86 c) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the above sample. This is the answer I came up with for the standard error:

741402,Solving a certain differential equation when assuming a surface of revolution is minimal,"The problem is the following: Consider the surface of revolution
$$
\textbf{q} (t, \mu) = (r(t)\cos(\mu),r(t)\sin(\mu),t)
$$
If $\textbf{q}$ is minimal, then $r(t) = a\cosh(t)+b\sinh(t)$ for $a,b$ constants. I'll skip the calculations. I've equated the mean curvature and $0$ and obtained the relation
$$
1+\dot{r}^2 = r\ddot{r}
$$
where each is understood to be a function of $t$. It's been a while since I've taken a class on differential equations, but since I ""know"" the solution, my plan was to check $r = \cosh(t)$ and $r = \sinh(t)$ are solutions to the above, and then conclude a linear combination of them is also a solution. However, $\cosh(t)$ worked fine, but I cannot really get $\sinh(t)$ to work the same. I get
$$
1+\dot{r}^2 = 1 + \cosh(t)^2 = 2 + \sinh(t)^2 \ne \sinh(t)^2
$$
is there perhaps an identity I'm not recalling/don't know? I also tried ""guessing"" $r(t) = a\cosh(t)+b\sinh(t)$, but that didn't work out too well either. Any suggestions? Edit: The ""solution"" to check in the book was incorrect, which was kind of clear anyway since $\sinh(t)$ wasn't working.","['minimal-surfaces', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'differential-geometry']"

Let $P$ be our focal point, lying on $C$ (but not lying on the directrix $D$). Let e be an arbitrary point on $D$, and let $E$ be the great circle passing through e , perpendicular to $D$. Let a great circle through $P$ meet $E$ at point f such that f is equidistance from e and $P$. Finally, let our ""parabola"" consists of all such points equidistant from focal point $P$ and directrix $D$ (measured along the ""straight lines"" of great circles). From what I can tell, there are only two possibilities for the shape of this ""parabola"": either (1) $P$ will lie on one of the apexes of the circle (that is, one of the two points where great circles perpendicular to $D$ intersect), in which case the ""parabola"" will be a small circle; otherwise, (2) $P$ will lie at some other point along $C$, in which case I'm uncertain about the shape, other than that it will be symmetrical with respect to $C$ and occupy one hemisphere (since it will lie entirely above $D$).
