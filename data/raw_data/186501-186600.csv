3456599,What's objectionable about the Axiom of Countable Additivity?,"Casella & Berger (2001) write: the Axiom of Countable Additivity, is not universally accepted among statisticians. ...  [It] is rejected by a school of statisticians led by deFinetti (1972), who chooses to replace this axiom with the Axiom of Finite Additivity. What might possibly be wrong or objectionable about the Axiom of Countable Additivity? (Simple examples would be helpful!) The Axiom of Countable Additivity is the 3rd condition below:","['axioms', 'probability']"
3456628,"Closure of a subspace of $\textsf{C}(J)$, where $J = [t_0-\beta,t_0+\beta]$","Question: Let $\textsf{C}(J)$ be the metric space of all real-valued continuous functions on the interval $J = [t_0-\beta,t_0+\beta]$ with the metric $d$ defined by $$d(x,y)=\max_{t\in J}|x(t)-y(t)|.$$ Let $K$ be a subspace of $\textsf{C}(J)$ consisting of all those functions $x\in\textsf{C}(J)$ that satisfy $$|x(t)-x_0|\leq c\beta$$ for a fixed $c$ . Show that $K$ is closed in $\textsf{C}(J)$ . Here is my approach. Let $x\in\overline{K}$ . Then there exists a sequence $(x_n)\subset K$ such that $x_n$ converges to $x$ . Thus we have for any $\varepsilon>0$ , there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that whenever $n>N$ , we have $$|x(t)-x_n(t)|<\varepsilon$$ To show $K$ is closed, it suffices to show that $x\in K$ . Thus, $$\begin{align}
|x(t)-x_0| &= |x(t)-x_n(t)+x_n(t)-x_0| \\
&\leq |x(t)-x_n(t)|+|x_n(t)-x_0| \\
&< \varepsilon+c\beta
\end{align}$$ for which $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty.$ Thus, $|x(t)-x_0|<c\beta$ , which implies that $x\in K$ . Am I correct with this proof?","['metric-spaces', 'proof-verification', 'functional-analysis', 'real-analysis']"
3456630,Find $a$ such that family of $x^2+ay^2=r^2$ is orthogonal to $y=5x^2$,"I got a different solution from my professor on this exercise: Find $a>0$ such that the family of ellipses $x^2+ay^2=r^2$ is orthogonal to $y=5x^2$ , with $r>0$ . Solution: $a=2$ . Let me show you what I've done: The family of orthogonal curves to $f(x,y,r)=x^2+ay^2-r^2$ is $$2x-2ay\cdot\frac{dx}{dy}=0 \implies \frac{1}{x}dx=\frac{1}{a}ydy \implies Kx=e^{1/{a}}\cdot{y}$$ Hence $$y=kxe^{1/a}$$ is the family of orthogonal curves to the ellipse. But that's nowhere close to $y=5x^2$ , and of course if I do $a=2$ my solution is not equal to $y=5x^2$ , given that $K$ and $a$ must be constants and cannot depend on $x$ . Therefore I came up with the solution that $y-5x^2=0$ cannot be orthogonal to $x^2+ay^2-r^2=0$ . What am I missing here?

3456758,Missing part in this colouring argument,"Problem. Prove that for $n$ vertices, where $n$ is odd, it is possible to colour all edges of the complete graph formed by those vertices in $n$ colours so that for any choice of three distinct colours from those $n$ , there is a triangle (edges connecting three vertices) coloured with that triplet of colours. Partial solution. Arrange the vertices in a regular $n$ -sided polygon and colour its sides, one colour per side. Each diagonal in this polygon is parallel to a side: colour it with the same colour as the corresponding parallel side. Now, all edges of the graph are coloured. There is exactly the same number of triangles in this graph as there is choices of three colours out of $n$ . Hence, the statement holds if there are no triangles with more than one edge coloured by the same colour--and there aren't any, because that would ask for the triangle to have two parallel sides. Question. This solution does not observe the case of duplicate triangles, i.e. what if there is a triangle parallel to another triangle, hence having the same colouring and ""wasting"" a triangle in the process? How do we eliminate that possibility?","['graph-theory', 'combinatorics', 'geometry', 'coloring']"
3456780,"100 coins made up of pennies, dimes and quarters worth $5.00","I'm currently working through the book 'Elementary Number Theory' by Underwood Dudley, and I came across an example of seeing whether or not we can have 100 cents, dimes and quarters be worth exactly $5.00. Before I begin, I know the above task is impossible, but I want to know the logic behind the steps we took to arrive at that conclusion. In the example we derived 2 equations, $c+d+q = 100$ and $c+10d+25q=500$ Which was relatively straightforward. But what I have trouble with is the following: When we subtract the 1st equation from the 2nd, we get $9d+24q=400$ , which I know is to cancel out the c, but why? The 2 values are of different types, the first equation deals with the number of coins , the second deals with the number of cents , if we subtract the 2 equations, then aren't we subtracting coins from cents, which shouldn't be possible? Then the example goes to show that it's not possible to have exactly 5 dollars with 100 coins comprised pennies, dimes, etc.. by applying a previously defined lemma on the equation $9d+24q=400$ , which is out of the scope of this question, so what I'm after is: Is there a way to visualize what we're doing to the equations in terms of the objects in this question? (coins, pennies, etc...)? I just want an intuitive understanding of what we're doing here. I've tried to visualize the 2 equations as scales that we need to balance, but I can't quite fit my model into this question as the scales differ in units of measurement ( coins vs pennies ).","['elementary-number-theory', 'algebra-precalculus']"
3456797,Is it acceptable to have a fraction in an eigenvector?,"The professor teaching a class I am taking wants me to find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors for the following matrix below. $$\begin{bmatrix}-5 & 5\\4 & 3\end{bmatrix}$$ I have succeeded in getting the eigenvalues, which are $\lambda= \{ 5,-7 \}$ .

3456885,What is the largest possible probability that a random matrix over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is non-singular?,"Suppose $A(p, n)=(a_{ij}(p))_{i, j \leq n}$ is an $n\times n$ random matrix over $\mathbb{F_2}$ , with  all its entries being i.i.d. and such that $P(a_{ij}(p) = 1) = p$ , where $p$ is some real number from $[0; 1]$ . What is the largest possible probability, that $A(p, n)$ is non-singular and with what $p$ is it reached? Note, that $A(p, n)$ in non-singular iff $det(A(p, n)) = 1$ . Solution for $n=1$ : $det(A(p, 1)) = 1$ with probability $p$ . The maximum of $det(A(p, 1))$ is $1$ and it is reached with $p = 1$ . Solution for $n = 2$ : $det(A(p, 2)) = 1$ with probability $2p^2(1 - p^2)$ . The maximum of $P(det(A(p, 2))=1)$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ and it is reached with $p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ . However, I would like to know some sort of general formula (or at least asymptotics). EDIT: After I failed to solve this problem using determinants, I tried to prove this using the fact that asquare matrix is non-singular iff its rows are linearly dependent. As there exists only one non-zero element in $\mathbb{F_2}$ , we can write linear dependence of the vector system $\{v_i\}_{i \leq n}$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ as $\forall S \subset \{1, ... , n\}$ such that $S \neq \emptyset$ we have $\sum_{i \in S} v_i \neq \overline{0}$ . I know the probability that a given set of vectors with i.i.d. random entries Bernoulli distributed with parameter $p$ $\{v_i\}_{i \leq k}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ satisfy $\sum_{i = 1}^k v_i \neq \overline{0}$ is $(1 - \frac{p((1 - 2p)^k - 1)}{1 - 2p})$ . However, I do not know how to proceed further in this direction.","['finite-fields', 'matrices', 'linear-algebra', 'random-matrices', 'probability']"
3456920,Probability of selecting three even number in A.P.(Arithmetic Progression) among first 100 Natural number,"From first 100 natural numbers, 3 numbers are selected. If these three numbers are in A.P., then find the probability that these numbers are even. My approach is as follow, selection of three number from first 100 natural numbers is $^{100}C_3$ which is equal to 161700.
Let the third term be represented by the series $a+2d=T$ where T is less than 100, where a and d are Natural Numbers $a+2d \le100$ As the numbers are even a=2c and d=2e $c+2e \le50$ $c\le50-2e$ e has values from 1 to 24 Total number of cases are $2*(1+2+3+..+24)=600$ Series can be reversed also hence number of cases are 1200, but the answer is $\frac{1}{66}$ , which means that the number of cases are 1225 where the five cases are missing","['combinatorics', 'probability']"
3456929,"Find all integer z for which there exist a Nth degree polynomial P that $P(z)$ is not an integer, and $P(0),P(2),P(3),\cdots,P(N+1)$ are integers.","Let $P(x)$ be a polynomials of degree $N$ with real coefficients such that $P(0),P(2),P(3),\cdots,P(N+1)$ are integers. Find all integer $z$ for which there exist a polynomial $P$ that $P(z)$ is not an integer. Note that we don't refer to $P(1)$ . my question : Is there any rules for $z$ ? example : $N=1$ If 2nd degree polynomial $P(x)$ holds that $P(0)$ and $P(2)$ are integers, then we can say that $P(2k)$ is an integer for all integers $k$ , but it is not always true that $P(2k+1)$ is an integer.(e.g. $P(x)=x/2$ ) So the all $z$ that we are searching for are all integers $z$ which hold $z\equiv 1 \pmod 2$ . my attempt We have some propositions which might help. If a polynomial of degree $N$ with rational coefficients takes integer values on $0,1,2,\ldots,N$ , then it takes integer values on any integer points. Let $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ . If a integer-valued polynomial of degree $N$ is divisible by $k$ on $0,1,2,\ldots,N$ , it is divisible by $k$ in any integer point. Let $q$ is a prime number. If a integer-valued polynomial of degree $q-1$ is not divisible by $q$ on all points of $0,1,2,\ldots,q-1$ , it is not divisible by $q$ on any integer. We can generalize them for the points on $k,k+l,k+2l,k+3l\ldots$ (where $k,l\in\mathbb{Z})$ . And I have a conjecture. If $P(0),P(2),P(3),\cdots,P(N+1)\equiv0\pmod{N+1}$ , then $P$ takes integer values on all integer points. in other words, For any denominator of the value of polynomial $P$ on integer point, it is a divisor of $N+1$ . I think that this is why $P(x)$ have some relations to the factor of $N+1$ . attempt on PC: I tested some (about hundreds each) cases.
I found that $P(x)$ can be classified by when $P(x)$ becomes an integer. (see the bottom of this post) Then I found some rules. When $N+1$ is prime: If $N+1$ is a prime number, then the $z$ which we are looking for satisfy that $z\equiv 1\pmod{N+1}$ . When $N+1$ is composite: If $N+1$ can be factored into $N+1=p_1^{a_1}\cdot p_2^{a_2}\cdots {p_m}^{a_m}$ , then the $z$ are some of the $z$ which satisfy this: $$z\equiv 1,N+2,N+2+p_1,N+2+2p_1,\ldots,N+2+b_1 p_1\pmod{{p_{1}}^{\lceil log_{p_1}{N} \rceil+a_1-1}}\lor\\

3456972,Lebesgue Integral with Push forward measure,"Let $(\Omega_1, \mathcal{A}_1)$ , $(\Omega_2, \mathcal{A}_2)$ be measurable spaces and $f\colon \Omega_1 \rightarrow \Omega_2$ be an $(\mathcal{A}_1,\mathcal{A}_2)$ -measurable function. Furthermore, let $\mu\colon \mathcal{A}_1 \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ be a measure and define $f_*\mu =\mu\circ f^{-1}$ as the pushforward measure of $\mu$ . For every measurable $g\colon \Omega_2 \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ we then have $\displaystyle \int_{\Omega_2} g\,\mathrm{d}\left( f_*\mu\right)=\int_{\Omega_1} (g\circ f)\,\mathrm{d}\mu$ My proof is as follows: Step 1 : Show the statement for $g=\chi_{A_i},\ A_i\in\mathcal{A}_2$ and $\chi$ is the indicator function ( $1$ on $A_i$ and $0$ elsewhere) $\displaystyle\int_{\Omega_2}\chi_{A_i}\,\mathrm{d}\left( f_*\mu\right)=\mu\circ f^{-1}(A_i)=\int_{\Omega_1}\chi_{f^{-1}(A_i)}\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int_{\Omega_1}\chi_{A_i}\circ f\,\mathrm{d}\mu$ Here I used that $\chi_{A_i}\circ f=\chi_{f^{-1}(A_i)}$ Step 2: Show for $g=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\chi_{A_i},\ \alpha_i\in(0,\infty], A_i\in\mathcal{A}_2$ , that is, for a simple function. $\displaystyle \int_{\Omega_2} \sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\chi_{A_i}\,\mathrm{d}\left( f_*\mu\right)=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\int_{\Omega_2}\chi_{A_i}\,\mathrm{d}\left( f_*\mu\right)=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i\int_{\Omega_1}\left( \chi_{A_i}\circ f\right)\,\mathrm{d}\mu\\
\displaystyle =\int_{\Omega_1}\left ( \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \chi_{A_i}\right)\circ f\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int_{\Omega_1}\left (g\circ f\right)\,\mathrm{d}\mu$ In the second equality I used Step 1 and in the third I used that $\chi_{A_i}\circ f$ is again a simple function. Step 3: Show the statement for the $g$ as stated at the top. Since $g$ is measurable, there exists a sequence of simple functions $g_n$ which is monotonically increasing to $g$ . $\displaystyle \int_{\Omega_2}g\,\mathrm{d}\left(f_*\mu\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{\Omega_2}g_n\,\mathrm{d}\left(f_*\mu\right)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\int_{\Omega_1}g_n\circ f\,\mathrm{d}\mu=\int_{\Omega_1}g\circ f\,\mathrm{d}\mu$ In the first equality I used the monotonicity of the Lebesgue Integral for simple functions (already proved in my book). In the second inequality I am not sure if my argument is correct. I used that $g_n\circ f$ converges monotonically to $g\circ f$ . Is this correct? I know that $g_n\circ f$ is again a step function, but I am unsure if it indeed converges to $g\circ f$ .","['integration', 'measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'lebesgue-integral']"

I wonder the following: Question: What are the maximal fixed-point free subgroups of $\mathrm U(2)$ ? A group $\Gamma\subset\mathrm U(2)$ is fixed-point free if there are no non-trivial $T\in\Gamma$ and non-zero $v\in\Bbb C^2$ with $Tv=v$ . For example, $\mathrm U(2)$ itself is not fixed-point free, as $$T:=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ \phantom+0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\in \mathrm U(2)\setminus\{\mathrm{Id}\}$$ has the fixed point $(0,1)\in\Bbb C^2$ . I know that $\mathrm{SU}(2)\subset\mathrm U(2)$ is fixed point free (it acts like the multiplicative group of unit quaternions on $\Bbb H\cong\Bbb C^2$ ).
It is also maximal, since it acts regularly on the unit sphere $\Bbb S^1(\Bbb C)\subset\Bbb C^2$ . 
There are also the conjugates of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ .
But are there any others? Update Thanks to the enlightening answer by YCor, I understand that the problem in this form seems to be intractable. By that answer I also realized that what I am more interested in are those maximal fixed-point free subgroups that have ""interesting"" finite subgroups, that is, other than, say, $\{\mathrm{Id}\}$ and $\{\pm\mathrm{Id}\}$ . Or also, closed subgroups (in the topological sense). YCor's answer already established that besides $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ we have the maximal torus $\mathrm U(1)\times\mathrm U(1)$ as another maximal subgroup.

Yes, hence we can write: $$\forall_{x \in \mathbb{R}}\;f_X(x) \geq 0$$ The pdf has to be integrable and its total area under the curve has to be equal $1$ : $$\begin{align*} &\int_{\mathbb{R}}f_X = 1 \\ &\color{red}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(x)dx = 1} \\ \end{align*}$$ (for now assume the condition is true) PDF plot: Computing CDF which is defined as: $$F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x}f_X(t)dt$$ Therefore: If $x < 0$ : $$F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} 0dt = 0$$ If $x \geq 0 \; \land \; x \leq 3$ : $$\begin{align*}F_X(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{0}0dt + \int_{0}^{x}\frac{1}{9}\big(3 + 2t - t^2\big)dt = \\ &= 0 + \frac{1}{9}\Big(3t + t^2 - \frac{1}{3}t^3 \Big)\Bigg|^{x}_0 = \\ &= \frac{1}{9} \Big(3x + x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 \Big)\end{align*}$$ If $x \geq 3$ : $$\begin{align*} F_X(x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{0}0dt + \int_{0}^{3}\frac{1}{9}\Big(3 + 2t - t^2 \Big)dt + \int_{3}^{x}0dt \\ &= 0 + \frac{1}{9}\Big(3t + t^2 - \frac{1}{3}t^3 \Big)\Bigg|^3_0 + 0 = \\ &= 1 \end{align*}$$ (this implicitly confirms the $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ condition) Finally the CDF is defined as: $$F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 0 \; \; : x < 0 \\ \frac{1}{9} \Big(3x + x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 \Big) \; \; : x \geq 0 \; \land \; x \leq 3 \\ 1 \; \; : x > 3 \end{cases}$$ The CDF result agrees with: $$\lim_{x \to \infty}F_X(x) = 1 \; \land \; \lim_{x \to -\infty}F_X(x) = 0 $$ Also the function is non-decreasing and continuous. CDF plot: Calculating $P(X > 0.5)$ : $$\begin{align*}P(X > 0.5) &= \int_{0.5}^{\infty}f_X(x)dx = \\ &= \int_{0.5}^{3}\frac{1}{9}(3+2x-x^2)dx + \int_{3}^{\infty}0dx = \\ &= \frac{1}{9} \Big(3x + x^2 - \frac{1}{3}x^3 \Big)\Bigg|^3_{0.5} + 0 = \\ &= \frac{175}{216} \approx 0.81\end{align*}$$ This probability solution does not agree with the book's solution.

Note: In this question, 'ring' means ring with unity, but not necessarily commutative In fact, in a (non-trivial) reduced ring, the number of idempotents is either even or $\infty$ . The reason is that the idempotents come in pairs $e,1-e$ . And $e \neq1-e$ , otherwise $ee=e-ee$ and $e^2=0$ , implying (since the ring is reduced) that $e=0$ , which can't happen if $e=1-e$ . My next question is, does there exist a reduced ring whose number of idempotents is a multiple of $3$ ? (For example, can we find a reduced ring with $6$ idempotent elements? $12$ ? $18$ ? $3000$ ?) What about rings in general? (i.e. not necessarily reduced) Attempting the easiest case first, assume $R$ is a reduced ring and the idempotent elements are $\{0,1,a,(1-a),b,(1-b)\}$ (all distinct). I see that the product of two idempotents must be idempotent (since the idempotents commute with everything). Also, I see that the square of the difference of two idempotents must also be idempotent.

3458004,Collar definitions are equivalent in metric space,"There are two different definitions used for collars in a topological space $X$ , the one used in Locally flat imbeddings of topological manifolds, Brown, 1962 , and the one used in A new proof of Brown's collaring theorem, Connelly, 1971 . Connelly claims that these definitions are equivalent when $X$ is metrizable and the collared subset $X'$ is closed in $X$ . How to show that? Definitions A subset $X' \subset X$ is Brown-collared in $X$ , if there exists an open embedding $h' : X' \times [0, 1) \to X$ , such that $h'(x, 0) = x$ . A subset $X' \subset X$ is Connelly-collared in $X$ , if there exists a closed embedding $h : X' \times [0, 1] \to X$ , such that $h|(X' \times [0, 1))$ is an open embedding, $h(x, 0) = x$ . Some examples For this question we will assume that $X'$ is closed in $X$ , since being Connelly-collared implies that. Let $X = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \geq 0\}$ , and $X' = (0, 1) \times \{0\}$ . Let $h' : X' \times [0, 1) \to X$ be such that $h'((x, 0), t) = (x, t)$ .

Let $X = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \geq 0\}$ , and $X' = [0, 1] \times \{0\}$ . Let $h : X' \times [0, 1] \to X$ be such that $h((x, 0), t) = (x, t)$ . Then $h$ is not a Connelly-collar of $X'$ in $X$ , since $h(X' \times [0, 1))$ is not open in $X$ . Let $X = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y \geq 0\} \setminus \{(0, 0), (1, 0)\}$ (where the latter set contains two points), and $X' = (0, 1) \times \{0\}$ . Let $h : X' \times [0, 1] \to X$ be such that $h((x, 0), t) = (x, (0.5 - |x - 0.5|)t)$ . Then $h$ is a Connelly-collar of $X'$ in $X$ . Connelly $\implies$ Brown Clearly $h' = h|(X' \times [0, 1))$ is a Brown-collar of $X'$ . Connelly $\impliedby$ Brown My idea was to study the function $h(x, t) = h'(x, t/2)$ It is then not hard to show that $h$ is an embedding, $h|(X' \times [0, 1))$ is an open embedding, and $h(x, 0) = x$ . The problematic part is to show that $h$ is closed. Edit: Moishe Kohan's counter-example below shows that when $h$ is defined this way, it may not be closed.

Construct a random function $\phi:\kappa\times\lambda\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ by flipping a fair coin for each element of the domain. What is the probability, $P(\kappa,\lambda)$ , that there exists $\alpha<\kappa$ such that $\forall x \, \phi(\alpha,x)=0$ .  Intuitively, it seems like there should be a cardinal $\eta_\lambda$ (for each $\lambda$ ) such that: $P(\kappa,\lambda)=0$ if $\kappa<\eta_\lambda$ and $P(\kappa,\lambda)=1$ if $\kappa\geq\eta_\lambda$ .
( EDIT 2 :) However, based on the comments, it sounds like this intuitive question cannot be formalized in a reasonable way. Where should I look to get a better understanding of why this is the case? Are there specific theorems that would be useful for understanding this? EDIT 1 : There has been debate in the comments about whether this question is meaningful without specifying a measure on $^{\kappa\times\lambda}2$ .  If $X=[0,\frac{1}{2})$ , then $[0,1]$ is a disjoint union of $X$ and a translate of $X$ . Therefore, $\mu(X)=\frac{1}{2}$ for any translation invariant probability measure, $\mu$ , on $[0,1]$ (for which $X$ is measurable). So, we can argue that $X$ has measure $\frac{1}{2}$ for any probability measure on $[0,1]$ having certain natural properties. In the setting of binary functions on $\kappa\times\lambda$ , there are similar ""symmetries"" akin to translation invariance.  For example, one would expect $\mu(X)=\mu(\{1-\phi:\phi\in X\}$ .  So, what I'm interested in is whether one can make an argument about the measure of $Y=\{\phi\in^{\kappa\times\lambda}2:\exists\alpha<\kappa\forall \beta<\lambda(\phi(\alpha,\beta)=0)\}$ that is based on conditions we would want any ""uniform"" probability measure to satisfy.","['cardinals', 'probability-theory', 'set-theory']"

3458615,What does the complex logarithm look like?,"Let $\mathbb{R}^\leq$ be the set of real numbers that are less than or equal to zero. I am thinking about the map $f(z) : \mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}^\leq \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ given by $f(z) = \log(z)$ . I know that the logarithm is analytic on this domain, therefore it must be conformal, which means the mapping has to  preserve angles. This implies some geometric properties of the space after the mapping is applied to it. For example, any triangle must have angles that add up to $180^\circ$ , or $\pi$ . I think it also means that any theorems of Euclidean geometry that are true of regular points in $\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}^\leq$ will also be true after applying the log transformation, but I'm not sure about this, nor sure how to prove it if it is true. I am able to do computations, for example, if I wanted to find all possible values of $\log(1+i)$ , then I would do the following: Find the polar representation of $1+i$ . The angle is $45^\circ$ which is $\pi/4$ . The magnitude is $\sqrt{2}$ . Therefore I can write $$1+i = re^{i\theta} = \sqrt{2}e^{i\pi/4}$$ The angle doesn't have to be only $\pi/4$ , we can also add or subtract any multiple of $2\pi$ and still get the same result: $$1+i =  \text{any element of this set: } \left\{\sqrt{2}\exp\left(\displaystyle\frac{i\pi}{4} + 2k\pi i\right)\,\, {\Big | }
\,\, k \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$$ This corresponds to the logarithm having infinitely many values: $$\log(1+i) = \text{any element of this set: }\,\, \boxed{\,\left\{\left(k+\frac{1}{8}\right)i \pi \ln 2  \,\,\,{\Big | } \, \,k \in \mathbb{Z}\right\}\,}$$ This method will also allow the computation of the infinitely many possible values for exponents like $\left(1+i\right)^{\left(1+i\right)}$ . I can do the computations and I can apply the definitions. However, I fundamentally lack any visual intuition about this mapping. The ""Riemann surface"" pictured on Wikipedia makes no sense to me and the explanation they give is very technical. Any help giving me visual intuition for this mapping would be very useful.

[ Hint : $f(x) = \big\{ f(x) / g(x) \big\} g(x)$ .] Here is my Math SE post on this problem. And, here is Prob. 2, Sec. 6,3: In addition to the suppositions of the preceding exercise, let $g(x) > 0$ for $x \in [a, b]$ , $x \neq c$ . If $A > 0$ and $B = 0$ , prove that we must have $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)/g(x) = \infty$ . If $A < 0$ and $B = 0$ , prove that we must have $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)/ g(x) = -\infty$ . My Attempt: Suppose that $f$ and $g$ are real-valued functions defined on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and that $c \in [a, b]$ is such that (i) $g(x) > 0$ for $x \in [a, b]$ such that $x \neq c$ , (ii) $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists in $\mathbb{R}$ , and (iii) $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$ . Let us put $A \colon= \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $B \colon= \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ . Then $B = 0$ of course. We study the following two cases according as $A> 0$ or $A < 0$ . Case 1. First suppose that $A > 0$ . Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ be arbitrary. Then as $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = A$ , so there exists a real number $\delta_1 > 0$ and depending on $A > 0$ such that $$ \big\lvert  f(x) - A \big\rvert  < \frac{A}{2} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \big\lvert x-c \big\rvert < \delta_1$ . Therefore we have $$ f(x) > \frac{A}{2} > 0 \tag{1} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \big\lvert x-c \big\rvert < \delta_1$ . Now as $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$ , and as $$ \frac{A}{2 \big( \lvert \alpha \rvert + 1 \big) } > 0, $$ so there exists a real number $\delta_2 > 0$ and depending on $\alpha$ (and $A$ ) such that $$ 0 < g(x) =  \big\lvert g(x)  \big\rvert = \big\lvert g(x) - 0 \big\rvert < \frac{A}{2 \big( \lvert \alpha \rvert + 1 \big) } $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta_2$ . Therefore we must also have $$ \frac{1}{g(x)} > \frac{ 2 \big( \lvert \alpha \rvert + 1 \big) }{A} \tag{2} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta_2$ . Let us put $\delta \colon= \min \left\{ \delta_1, \delta_2 \right\}$ . Then $\delta > 0$ since both $\delta_1 > 0$ and $\delta_2 > 0$ . Then from (1) and (2) above, we can conclude that for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta$ , we must have $$ \frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) } = f(x) \frac{1}{g(x)} > \frac{A}{2} \frac{ 2 \big( \lvert \alpha \rvert + 1 \big) }{A} = \lvert \alpha \rvert + 1 > \lvert \alpha \rvert \geq \alpha. $$ Thus we have shown that, corresponding to any given real number $\alpha$ , there exists a real number $\delta > 0$ and depending on $\alpha$ such that $$ \frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) } > \alpha $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta$ . Therefore by virtue of Definition 4.3.5 (i) in Bartle & Sherbert, 4th edition, we conclude that $$ \lim_{x \to c} \frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) } = +\infty. $$ Case 2. Now suppose that $A < 0$ . Let us choose an arbitrary real number $\beta$ . Then as $A< 0$ , so $-A>0$ , and there exists a real number $\delta_1 > 0$ and depending on $A$ such that $$ \big\lvert f(x) - A \big\rvert < \frac{-A}{2} $$ and so $$ f(x) < \frac{A}{2} < 0 \tag{3} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ such that $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta_1$ . Also there exists a real number $\delta_2 > 0$ and depending on $\beta$ (and also on $A$ ) such that $$ 0 < g(x) = \big\lvert g(x) \big\rvert = \big\lvert g(x) - 0 \big\rvert < \frac{ A }{ -2 \big( \lvert \beta \rvert + 1 \big) } $$ and so $$ \frac{1}{g(x) } > \frac{-2 \big( \lvert \beta \rvert + 1 \big)  }{ A } > 0 \tag{4} $$ for all $x \in [a, b]$ satisfying $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \delta_2$ . Then, for all $x \in [a, b]$ for which $0 < \lvert x-c \rvert < \min\left\{ \delta_1, \delta_2 \right\}$ , we also have $$
\begin{align}
 \frac{ f(x) }{ g(x) } &= f(x) \frac{1}{g(x)} \\
&< f(x) \left( \frac{-2 \big( \lvert \beta \rvert + 1 \big)  }{ A } \right) \qquad  [ \mbox{because of (4) and the fact from (3) that $f(x) < 0$} ]\\
&< \frac{A}{2} \left(  \frac{-2 \big( \lvert \beta \rvert + 1 \big)  }{ A } \right) \qquad [ \mbox{ Refer to (3) and (4) above again. } ] \\
&= - \lvert \beta \rvert - 1  \\
&< -\lvert \beta \vert \\
&\leq \beta. 
\end{align}
$$ Since $\beta$ was an arbitrarily chosen real number, it follows from Definition 4.3.5 (ii) that $$ \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = -\infty. $$ Is this proof correct and rigorous enough for Bartle & Sherbert? If so, then is there any necessity for the assumptions of continuity of $f$ and $g$ on $[a, b]$ and differentiability of these functions on $(a, b)$ ? Or, what is missing in my proof?

3458836,Evaluating the integral $\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(x)}{e^x+1}$ [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : $\int_0^{\infty } \frac{\log (x)}{e^x+1} \, dx = -\frac{1}{2} \log ^2(2)$ How to show? (2 answers) Closed 4 years ago . I'm interested in evaluating the integral of $$ \int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(x)}{e^x+1}\ $$ TLDR: How do you evaluate $ \eta'(1) $ ? I found and adapted this integral from this video , unfortunately, they didn't fully evaluate the integral and I'm interested in the result. This question is similar to this , but my question goes more in-depth on the way that I tried to evaluate this integral. This was solved by @J.G. in the answers, and by @Zacky in the comments. I'll run through what I did and what the video did to evaluate the integral $$ I =\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(x)}{e^x+1}$$ Multiplying by $ \frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}}\ $ results in $$ = \int_0^\infty\frac{e^{-x}\ln(x)}{e^{-x}+1} $$ Expanding the denominator into a geometric sum results in $$ = \int_0^\infty\ e^{-x}\ln(x)\sum_{k\ge0}{-e^{-x^k}} $$ Interchanging our signs of integration of summation and simplifying results in $$ \sum_{k \ge 0}(-1)^k \int_0^\infty\ e^{-x(k+1)}\ln(x) $$ Substituting $ x(k+1) = t $ and $ dx = \frac{dt}{k+1} $ results in $$ \sum_{k \ge 0} (-1)^k \int_0^\infty e^{-t}\ln(\frac t{k+1})\frac{dt}{k+1} $$ Expanded and simplified you get $$ \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1} (\int_0^\infty \ln(t)e^{-t}dt - \ln(k+1)\int_0^\infty e^{-t}dt) $$ Once again simplified we can see that our first integral is the $ \mathcal L\{\ln(t)\} $ at $s = 1$ and our second integral is $\Gamma(1)$ in total this results in. Where $ \mathcal L $ is the Laplace transform and $\Gamma$ is the Gamma function. $$ \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}(\mathcal L\{\ln(t)\}-\ln(k+1)\Gamma(1)) $$ This then simplifies to $$ \sum_{k \ge 0} \frac{(-1)^k}{k+1}(-\gamma-\ln(k+1)) $$ With $ \gamma $ being the euler-mascheroni constant Increasing our lower bound on our summation we get $$ \sum_{k \ge 1} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}k(-\gamma-\ln(k)) $$ Realizing that the Dirichlet Eta function is defined as $$ \eta(s) = \sum_{k \ge 1} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^s} $$ We can then see that our equation is $$ \eta(1)(-\gamma-\ln(k)) $$ Knowing that $ \eta(1) = \ln(2) $ we can then distribute our eta to get $$ -\gamma\ln(2)-\ln(k)\eta(1) $$ Which is $$ -\gamma\ln(2) - \sum_{k \ge 1} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}k\ln(k) $$ Taking the derivative of the eta function we can see that this is $$ -\gamma\ln(2)+\eta'(1) $$ According to Wikipedia $ \eta'(1) $ is equal to $ \gamma\ln(2)-\frac{\ln(2)^2}2$ Meaning that our integral $I$ will evaluate to $$ I = -\frac{\ln(2)^2}2$$ But how can we evaluate $ \eta'(1) $ without encountering the pole at $s = 1$ of the Zeta function? Are there any other interesting ways to evaluate this integral not using the eta function? Thank you for your time and patience!","['integration', 'number-theory', 'riemann-zeta']"

3458891,Proving Linkedness of Hopf Fibers,"So I've been working on understanding the Hopf fibration in terms of quaternions for the past few months, following along with the investigations in David Lyon's paper, "" An Elementary Introduction to the Hopf Fibration"" . I've done a good job getting through almost the entirety of the paper, until I get to the last investigation: Investigation (M). The Hopf fibration is a mapping from $S^3 \mapsto S^2$ such that the preimage of a point on $S^2$ is a circle (fiber) in $S^3$ . The previous investigation, which I already did successfully, shows that these fibers, when stereographically projected, are linked with the unit circle in the $yz$ -plane. This is simple enough. Here is investigation (M): To show that any two projected fiber circles $C$ and $D$ are linked, we exhibit a continuous one-to-one map $\psi: \mathbb{R}^3 → \mathbb{R}^3$ that takes $C$ to the unit circle in the $y, z$ -plane, and takes $D$ to some other projected fiber circle $E$ . Since $E$ is linked with the unit circle in the $y, z$ -plane, $C$ and $D$ must also be linked. See Figure 9. (Students who have never studied topology may accept the intuitively reasonable statement that linked-ness of circles cannot be altered by a continuous bijective map. Students with experience in topology may enjoy trying to prove this.) Here is how to construct the map $\psi$ . Let $P$ be any point on the circle $C$ , and let $r = s^{−1}(P)$ . Define $f: \mathbb{R}^4 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^4$ by $f(x) = kr^{−1}x$ (quaternion multiplication). The map $\psi$ is the composition $s \circ f \circ s^{−1}$ . Just for some background: $s$ is the stereographic projection map given by $$(w,x,y,z) \mapsto \left(\frac{x}{1-w}, \frac{y}{1-w}, \frac{z}{1-w} \right)$$ where $(w,x,y,z)$ is the vector in $\mathbb{R}^4$ associated with the quaternion given by the Hopf map. A long investigation previous to this (Investigation (J)) explains that these quaternions are $h^{-1}(P) = \{r_1 e^{it}\}_{0\leq t \leq 2\pi}$ where $P$ is any point on $S^2$ . This is not the same P as the one on the fiber in Investigation M . So this is how I'm thinking about the problem: I understand that if we can construct a continuous map that takes 2 fibers and sends one to the unit circle in the $yz$ -plane, then we have shown that since all fibers are linked with the unit circle, and continuous maps don't break linked-ness, then the fibers must be linked with each other. The part I can't get is actually proving this. Instead of creating a fiber, I just took a specific quaternion corresponding with a particular fiber and defined that as $r = s^{-1}(P)$ . If you apply $s(f(r))$ , you end up with $k$ . Then I picked another point on that fiber and used the same $r^{-1}$ to calculate $f$ , but the algebra ended up really messy and I wasn't getting anywhere. I know what should follow is a unit circle, but I don't think I'm approaching the problem correctly, because it seems overly tedious. Does anyone have any thoughts about how to prove this?

3458982,Synthetic construction of common self-polar triangle for two non-intersecting ellipses,"Many of the older (circa 1850-1925) books on projective geometry discuss the geometry of two conics. For example, points of intersection, common chords, common tangents, etc.  A self-polar triangle for a given conic is a triangle whose edges are the polars of its vertices, and whose vertices are the poles of its edges.  It is not unique, but the common self-polar triangle of two given conics, if it exists, is unique. My question is whether there is a ruler and compass construction for the common self-polar triangle of two non-intersecting non-nested ellipses. The books show how to determine the common self-polar triangle $\triangle{UVW}$ as in the following diagram. Start with the two conics $c$ and $d$ .  For any point $X$ , its reciprocal $X'$ is the intersection of the polars of $X$ with respect to $c$ and $d$ .  The reciprocal $l'$ of a line $l$ is the locus of the reciprocals $P'$ of points $P$ on $l$ .  It turns out to be a conic, so we call it the reciprocal conic of $l$ . Shown in the diagram are the lines $g,h$ and their reciprocal conics $g',h'$ .  These conics intersect at $Z'$ , the reciprocal of the intersection $Z$ of the two lines.  The other three intersection points - $U,V,W$ - are the vertices of the common self-polar triangle. Also shown are some reciprocal pairs $G,G'$ and $H,H'$ . The problem, which none of the books address, is that in general it is not possible to synthetically construct the intersection of two conics that are given by, say, 5 points each .  It is possible to do so if two or three of the intersection points are known , but one known intersection point is not enough. On the other hand, the setup is rich enough that there may be a ruler/compass construction.  As the lines $l$ vary, their conjugate conics always go through $U,V,W$ ( $Z'$ will vary).  Or there may be a synthetic construction of $U,V,W$ that goes through another route.  Or the books may be skipping over this step because they consider it to be obvious. Or the construction may be impossible using ruler and compass.

professional mathematicians to respond. In my answer, I assumed that each case was equally likely, and in my addendum-1 , which endorsed
the OP's identification of 104 cases, I assumed that each of the 104 cases was equally likely.  I now
question that assumption. In Minesweeper, there are always a greater number of unmined cells than mined cells.  Therefore,
it seems to me that in the OP's query, a case that involved only 4 mines in the region is more likely
than a case that involved 5 mines . Specifically, suppose that the underlying diagram which this minesweeper region came from

One simply cycles through the integers in one direction (first row is 12345, second row is 23451, third row is 34512 etc) and cycles through the colours in the opposite direction (first row is ABCDE, second row is EABCD, third row is DEABC). One can then conduct various transformations of this solution: interchanging any two colours with each other, or interchanging any two numbers swapping any two rows or columns rotating the board I have several questions relating to colour sudokus: What is the minimum number of squares which must be filled in order to determine a unique solution? I have done it with 5, but might it be done with fewer? Are there other solutions which cannot be generated through the transformations described above? If so, how many? How would the answers to the above questions change if we played on a different size of grid? Edit: this is a board in which 5 determines a unique solution. The large numbers in bold are the starting numbers. It is easy to deduce that '2A' must go in the top right corner (all other rows and columns have either a '2' or an 'A').

3459717,How to classify polyominoes by shape,"I am trying to find a robust way to classify and distinguish polyominoes . I would like to write a simple algorithm that could identify similar free polyominoes (under translation, rotation, reflection or glide reflection), given a set. Since I am new to this topic, I am getting a bit lost in the literature and I don't really know where to look. I was thinking that something based on counting the length of the sides could work. For example, the following polyomino: has one 5-length side, two 2-length sides and five 1-length sides. So we could describe it with the following notation: $\{(5,1),(2,2),(1,5)\}\,$ , where the first number in parenthesis stands for the length of the side and the second one for the number of sides of that length. Then, all translations, rotations, reflections or glide reflections of this shape would result in the same description. Which is good. However, this doesn't work in general. For example, the following two different polyominoes: would result in the same description $\{(5,1), (3,1), (2,2), (1,6) \}$ . Probably, someone has already figured out a better way to do this, but, as I said, I am getting lost in the literature of the topic. Can anybody point me to the right direction? Update: Thanks for the useful suggestions in the comments. After some more research I found an interesting method, explained in the book ""Linknot: Knot Theory by Computer - S. Jablan, R. Sazdanovic"" , which works like this: Let's imagine the path of a ray of light (bold line in figure) in a polyomino with the borders consisting of mirrors, where in every border cell we place two-sided mirrors (bolder lines) perpendicular to the internal edges in their midpoints . After a series of reflections, the ray of light will describe a shape called self-avoiding curve. If we denote a reflection in a border mirror by 0, and a reflection in an internal mirror by 1, we have 0-1 words for polyominoes, where these words are cyclically equivalent (this means, could be red starting from any sign 0 or 1 and ending in it).
For n = 1 we will have only one polyomino 0000, for n = 2 the polyomino 00010001, for n = 3 two polyominoes: 000101000101 and 000100100011, for n = 4 five of them: 0001010100010101, 0001010001100011, 001001001001, 0001001100010011, and 0001001010001011, etc. We can translate these symbols (or binary numbers) into hexadecimal numbers and assign one number to each polyomino, in order to establish one-to-one correspondence between the numbers and polyominoes. For example, this number can be the minimum of all cyclic-equivalent symbols (e.g. to the polyomino 00010001 correspond cyclically equivalent symbols 00100010, 01000100, 10001000 and the minimum of them is 00010001 = 11 in the hexadecimal system). Hence, we have a notation for polyominoes where exactly one number corresponds to every polyomino, and vice versa. This last part of the method is similar to what achille hui was suggesting in his ""dumb"" method, in the comments. I don't know how the efficiency of this approach compares to the efficiency of the ""dumb"" one, but I think it should be faster, since we are only considering the ""perimeter"" of the polyomino and forgetting about the cells in the inside (this could be a problem for polyominoes with holes, but for my application I am only interested in the outer perimeter, so it's not a big deal). However, I did not find a proof that in this notation ""exactly one number corresponds to every polyomino, and vice versa"" , even though it intuitively feels right. Update 2: To clarify, the reason why I want to label (or encode or hash , the difference is still not completely clear to me...) the polyominoes is because I have a code that simulates the evolution of a 2d system where the different states of the system can look like polyominoes (something like a cellular automaton ). Basically, labelling the different shapes would allow me to give at each state a unique identifier and, for example, efficiently count how many times a given state has been visited.","['hash-function', 'geometry', 'combinatorics', 'symmetric-groups', 'polyomino']"
