2114575,Partitions of n that generate all numbers smaller than n,"Consider a  partition $$n=n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_k$$ such that each  number $1,\cdots, n$ can be obtained
by adding some of the numbers  $n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_k$. 
For example, $$9=4+3+1+1,$$ and every number $1,2,\cdots,9$ be ca written as a sum of some of the numbers $4,3,1,1$. This other  partition 
 $$9=6+1+1+1$$ 
fails the desired property, as $4$ (and $5$)  cannot be given by any sum of $6,1,1,1$. Question: Can we charaterize which partitions of an arbitrary $n$ have
this property? We clearly need at least one $1$ among $n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_k$,
and intuitively we need  many small numbers $n_i$. But I can't see much beyond this. Any idea or reference  will be appreciated.","['combinatorics', 'integer-partitions', 'elementary-number-theory']"
2114584,Probability that every prefix of a toss sequence has more heads than tails,"We toss a coin $n + m$ times. When we are done, there have been $n$ heads and $m$ tails, with $n > m$. All sequences of results are equally likely. For example, if $n = 2$ and $m = 1$, then $P(HHT) = P(HTH) = P(THH) = \frac{1}{3}$. Now what is the probability that during the course of the experiment, the number of heads we've seen so far is always strictly larger than the number of tails we've seen so far? My first thought was to define $A_i$ to be the event that we've always have more heads than tails up to the end of the $i$th toss, and calculate $P(\bigcap_{i=1}^{n+m}A_i)$, but then I got stuck.","['probability', 'discrete-mathematics']"

2114636,How can I show that $v_i\otimes v_j$ is non zero in $V \otimes_\mathbb {F}V$,"Let $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space over a field $\mathbb F.$ Let $\rm dim (V)=n>0$ and $\mathcal {B}=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ be a basis of $V.$ Now we know dimension of  $V \otimes_\mathbb {F}V$ is $n^2$ as $V \otimes_\mathbb {F}V \cong \mathbb {F^{n^2}}.$ Now since the set $\mathcal {A}=\{v_i\otimes v_j:1 \leq i,j\leq n\}$ spans  $V \otimes_\mathbb {F}V$ and the number of elements in $\mathcal {A}$ is $n^2$, $\mathcal {A}$ forms a basis for  $V \otimes_\mathbb {F}V$ as a vector space over $\mathbb F.$ In this way every element in $\mathcal {A}$ is non zero.

2114664,Puzzle: Cut regular tetrahedron into distinct-sized regular tetrahedra?,"The classic problem of constructing a perfect squared square , i.e. tiling a square with a finite number of squares of pairwise distinct sidelengths (which must be rational multiples of the tiled square's, so we need only look for integral tilings) has solutions (one is shown below). However, it has been proved impossible to tile an equilateral triangle with equilateral triangles of distinct sizes (elegant proof here ). It is also impossible to do it for other (more-sided) regular polygons since the angle between a corner piece and the side of the tiled polygon will be acute . In three dimensions , one can prove very elegantly that it is impossible to divide a cube into a finite number of cubes of distinct sizes. A natural generalization is to ask whether it is possible to divide a regular tetrahedron into tetrahedra of distinct sizes (I assume  the other Platonic solids will not work)? This problem appears more complicated, and I don't know if either impossibility proof (for cube or equilateral triangle) will generalize to tetrahedra. ( This question appears to be asking something somewhat different, related to a specific type of division). It is possible however to tile an equilateral triangle with equilateral triangles which can have the same size if their orientation is different; an example is shown below. It is worth wondering whether such a dissection might be possible for the tetrahedron. Thus I have the following questions : Is it possible to divide a regular tetrahedron into regular tetrahedra of distinct sizes? If it is possible, can a proof like this be extended to show that all dissections are rational? Is the dissection possible if we only force tetrahedra of the same orientation to have distinct sizes?

2114817,Show that the closed unit-ball in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is homeomorphic to the unit-2 sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$,"This problem is taken from Topology: A First Course by Munkres Let $X$ be the closed unit ball $$\{ \langle x,  y\rangle \mid x^2 + y^2 \le 1\}$$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and let $X^{\ast}$ be the partition of $X$ consisting of all the one-point sets $\{ \langle x,  y\rangle\}$ for which $x^2 + y^2 < 1$, along with the set $S^1= \{ \langle x,  y\rangle \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}$.  One can show that $X^{\ast}$ is homeomorphic with the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$ called the unit 2-sphere, defined by $$S^2 = \{\langle x,  y, z\rangle \mid x^2 + y^2 + z^2 =1 \}.$$ My Attempted Proof $(X^*, \mathcal{T})$ is the quotient space of $X$ where $\mathcal{T}$ is the topology induces by the quotient map $p : X \to X^*$. $$\mathcal{T} = \left\{U \subset X^* \ \middle| \ p^{-1}(U) = X \cap W \text{ for $W$ open in $\mathbb{R}^2$}\right\}$$ Since $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, the topology $\mathcal{M}$ on $S^2$ is given by $$\mathcal{M} = \left\{S^2 \cap V \ | \ V \text{ open in $\mathbb{R}^3$}\right\}$$ Now define $h : X^* \to S^2$ by $$h\left(\langle x, y \rangle\right) = \begin{cases} \langle x, y, \sqrt{1-x^2 + y^2} \rangle \ \ \  \text{ if $x^2 + y^2 < 1$} \\
\langle x, y, 0 \rangle \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \text{ if $x^2 + y^2 = 1$} \\
\end{cases}$$ We now show that $h$ is a homeomorphism. Pick $U \in \mathcal{T}$, we first show that $h(U) \in \mathcal{M}$. $U$ is of the form $U = \{ \langle x, y \rangle \ | \ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \text{ or } x^2 + y^2 < 1 \}$, and by definition of $h$ we have $h(U) = \{\langle x, y , z\rangle \ | \ x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$. Fix $\epsilon > 0$ and choose $V = (-1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \times (-1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \times (-1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon)$. Then $V$ is open in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and we have $h(U) \cap V = h(U) \in \mathcal{M}$. Thus $U \in \mathcal{T} \implies h(U) \in \mathcal{M}$ We now have to prove that $h(U) \in \mathcal{M} \implies U \in \mathcal{T}$. But that is where I got stuck. I'm not show how to show $U \in \mathcal{T}$ if we pick $h(U) \in \mathcal{M}$. Am I on the correct track, are there any errors so far in my proof, is it non-rigorous. If so, please let me know. If not then how can I go about proving the reverse implication to show that $h$ is a homeomorphism?","['general-topology', 'proof-writing', 'proof-verification', 'quotient-spaces']"

2114831,Advantage of going first in a board game,"I've been playing with my son a simple board game where you roll a regular 6 faced die and move as many positions as you roll. So nothing fancy, just pure luck game. Lately I've been trying to teach him that is not OK for him to always go first. It's not fair. Then he asked me a good question. ""WHY?"". The answer is obvious, because you get a better chance of reaching the end of the board first. You may have an extra roll to reach the end of the board. But I would like to see some numbers / probabilities. Not to explain my son, but for my inner peace. So my question is: Is there a formula that shows the chances of winning if you go first depending on the board length? For simplicity, let's say that there are 2 players only and the traps and bonuses from the board are ignored. I tried an incremental approach. board has the length 1 => Player 1 always wins. board has the length 2 => Player 2 wins only if P1 rolls a 1 and P2 rolls 2 or more so P2 wins with a probability of $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{5}{36}$ and P1 with a probability of $\frac{31}{36}$. board has the lenght of 3 => I got lost in the math and my head hurts.

2114981,"Prob. 2, Sec. 1.4 in Kreyszig's Functional Analysis Book: Any Cauchy sequence with a convergent subsequence converges","Here is Prob. 2, Sec. 1.4 in the book Introductory Functional Analysis With Applications by Erwine Kreyszig. If $\left( x_n \right)$ is Cauchy and has a convergent subsequence, say, $x_{n_k} \to x$, show that $\left( x_n \right)$ is convergent with the limit $x$. My effort: Let $(X, d)$ be the metric space in which $\left( x_n \right)$ is a Cauchy sequence, and let $\varphi \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a strictly increasing function such that the sequence 
  $\left( x_{\varphi(n)} \right)$ converges to a point $x$ of $X$. And, we can put $$n_k = \varphi(k) \ \mbox{ for all } k \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Then, given a real number $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $N$ such that $$ (1) \ \ \ \  d \left( x_m, x_n \right) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \ \mbox{ for any pair } (m, n) \mbox{ of natural numbers such that } m > N \mbox{ and } n > N.$$ Now for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, we know that $n_k = \varphi(k) \in \mathbb{N}$; moreover, $$ n_k = \varphi(k) < \varphi(r) = n_r \ \mbox{ if $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $r \in \mathbb{N}$, and $k < r$},$$ because $\varphi$ is a strictly increasing function. Thus, $n_1 = \varphi(1) \in \mathbb{N}$ and so  $n_1 \geq 1$. Let $k$ be any natural number, and suppose that $$n_k = \varphi(k) \geq k.$$ Then since $\varphi$ is a strictly increasing function and since $k+1 \in \mathbb{N}$, therefore we can conclude that 
  $$n_{k+1} = \varphi(k+1) > \varphi(k) \geq k.$$
  But $\varphi(k+1) \in \mathbb{N}$. So we can conclude that $\varphi(k+1) \geq k+1$. Hence by induction it follows that $$n_k = \varphi(k) \geq k \mbox{ for all } k \in \mathbb{N}. $$ Thus we know that, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, (i) $\varphi(k) \in \mathbb{N}$ and (ii) $\varphi(k) \geq k$. Now since $$\lim_{k \to \infty} x_{\varphi(k)} = \lim_{k \to \infty} x_{n_k} = x, $$
  therefore we can find a natural number $K$ such that $$ (2) \ \ \ \ d\left( x_{n_k}, x \right) = d\left( x_{\varphi(k)}, x \right) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} \ \mbox{ for any natural number } k \mbox{ such that } k > K.$$ Now let $M$ be any natural number such that $M > \max \left( K, N \right)$. Such an $M$ exists since the set of natural numbers is not bounded above (or by the Archimedian property of $\mathbb{R}$). Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $n > M$. Then we note that 
  $$n_{M+1} = \varphi(M+1) \geq M+1 > M > K$$ so that (2) can be used, and we also note that $$n_{M+1} \in \mathbb{N}, \ \ \ n \in \mathbb{N},  \ \ \ n_{M+1} > M > N, \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ n > N$$
  so that (1) can be used. Then, from (1) and (2) above, we see that, $$ d\left( x_n, x\right) \leq d \left( x_n, x_{n_{M+1}} \right) + d \left( x_{n_{M+1}}, x \right) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} = \varepsilon,$$
  for any natural number $n > M$. Thus we have shown that, corresponding to  every real number $\varepsilon > 0$, we can find a natural number $M$ such that $$ d \left( x_n, x \right) < \varepsilon \ \mbox{ for any natural number } n > N.$$
  Hence the sequence  $\left(x_n \right)$ converges in the metric space $(X, d)$ to the point $x \in X$. Is the above proof correct? If so, then is the presentation good enough? If not, then where lies the flaw?","['real-analysis', 'cauchy-sequences', 'metric-spaces', 'sequences-and-series', 'analysis']"

Our contour $\mathcal C$ consists of a upper half-plane semicircle and the real axis joining the ends, where we take the limit of the radius to infinity. By Jordan's lemma, the semicircular part of $\mathcal C$ vanishes (first equality). Which leaves us to use the residue theorem (second equality) to compute, $$ \require{cancel}
I := \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x\sin(\pi x)}{(x^2+4)^3}dx = \frac{1}{2}\oint_{\mathcal C}f(z)dz = \pi \big(R\{f,2i\}\cancel{+R\{f,-2i\} }\big)\ .

\lim_{z\to 2i} \frac{1}{2!} \frac{d^2}{dz^2}\bigg( (z+2i)^{-3}z\sin(\pi z)  \bigg)
$$
in order to find the residue at $z=2i$. Although this seems tedious, we'll give it a try. To simplify the notation, put $a:=(z+2i)^{-1}$, $\ b:= \pi \cos(\pi z)\ $ and $\ c:= \sin(\pi z).$ For the first derivative on the left, this yields $$
(-3a^4 z + a^3)c + a^3bz \ ,
$$
which we can reorganize as $$
-3a^4 zc + a^3(c + bz) \ . 
$$ The second derivative yields $$
12a^5 cz-3a^4(c+bz) -3a^4(c+bz) + a^3(b-\pi^2 cz + b) ,

12a^5 cz -6a^4(c+bz) + a^3(2b-\pi^2 cz) \\

2115055,definition of derivative on finding limits,"For the absolute value function: $y = |x|$ , how does the definition of limit apply: The derivative of the function doesn't exist because the right hand derivative and the left hand derivative are not equal: Right-hand derivative of $|x|$ at zero = $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h}$$ $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{|h|}{h}$$ $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1$$ Left-hand derivative of $|x|$ at zero = $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{|0+h| - |0|}{h}$$ $$\lim_{x\to0^+} \frac{|h|}{h}$$ $$\lim_{x\to0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1$$ My question is when h approaches $x$ from the negative part, why doesn't $h$ become negative in the denominator? If it is because, the denominator was formed by: $$\lim_{x\to 0^+} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{(x-h) - x}$$, and since $h$ approaches from the negetive side, it becomes positive, then, how would this justify the following function: Where the function is defined only on the positive side.",['functions']

2115092,A condition on a non convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$,"In the euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ it's possible to state the following theorem: Theorem : Consider any finite set of $n$ points $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and any n-ple of positive real numbers $(r_1,\dots,r_n)$ such that $$\cap_{i=1}^nB_{r_i}(x_i)\neq\emptyset$$ where $B_{r_i}(x_i)$ is the closed ball of center $x_i$ and radius $r_i$. Then for any other set of $n$ points $\{x_1',\dots,x_n'\}\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $$|x'_i-x'_j|\le|x_i-x_j|$$ for every $i,j=1,\dots,n$ it also happens $$\cap_{i=1}^nB_{r_i}(x'_i)\neq\emptyset$$ Question : does this result still hold true if we consider $$X:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^2 \text{ such that } 0\le\text{arg}(x)\le 7\pi/4 \}$$ instead of $\mathbb{R}^2$? By this I mean that both $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ and $\{x_1',\dots,x_n'\}$ will be in $X$ and the condition $|x'_i-x'_j|\le|x_i-x_j|$ is replaced by $d(x'_i,x_j')\le d(x_i,x_j)$ where $d$ is the induced patch metric by the euclidean metric of $\mathbb{R}^2$ on $X$. Also, the intersections are considered in $X$ and the balls are defined using $d$. This doesn't seem easy to me because the only proof I know for the theorem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ isn't really easy (it's contained in ""A Lipschitz Condition Preserving Extension for a Vector Function"" by Valentine and it's for $\mathbb{R}^n$) and doesn't seem to adapt to the case of $X$. As user Moishe Cohen pointed out, I should sketch it. Lemma 1: (by Alexandrov and Hopf): Let $A_1,\dots,A_n$ be closed sets in $\mathbb{R}^m$ which cover the simplex $T$. Suppose that for each side $a_{i_1},\dots,a_{i_\tau}$ of $T$ it's true $a_{i_1},\dots,a_{i_\tau}\subset A_{i_1}\cup\dots\cup A_{i_\tau}$. Then $A_1\cap \dots\cap A_n\neq \emptyset$. Lemma 2 : Let $\Delta(x_1',\dots,x_n')$ be the euclidean simplex of vertex $x_1',\dots,x_n'$. Under the hypothesis of the theorem $\Delta(x_1',\dots,x_n')$ is covered by the sets $B_{r_i}(x'_i)$ proof of the lemma : suppose $\Delta(x_1',\dots,x_n')$ is not covered by the sets $B_{r_i}(x'_i)$, then we can choose
$$x\in \cap_{i=1}^nB_{r_i}(x_i)\neq\emptyset,\qquad x'\in \Delta(x_1',\dots,x_n')\setminus \cup_{i=1}^nB_{r_i}(x'_i)$$
call $R_i$ the vector from $x$ to $x_i$ and $R_i'$ the vector from $x'$ to $x_i'$. Since $|x'_i-x'_j|\le|x_i-x_j|$ it follows 
$$ |R_i'|>|R_i|, \qquad |R_i'-R_j'|\le|R_i-R_j|$$
for every $i,j=1,\dots,n$. This implies $R_i'\cdot R_j'>R_i\cdot R_j$. Let $(a_1',\dots,a_n')\in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^na_i'R_i'=0$, then from the previous inequality it follows $\sum_{i=1}^n|a_i'R_i'|^2<0$, which is impossible. proof of the theorem : since $\cap_{i=1}^nB_{r_i}(x_i)\neq\emptyset$ it follows $B_{r_i}(x_i)\cap B_{r_j}(x_j)\cap \overline{x_ix_j}\neq \emptyset$ and since $|x'_i-x'_j|\le|x_i-x_j|$ it follows $B_{r_i}(x'_i)\cap B_{r_j}(x'_j)\cap \overline{x'_ix'_j}\neq \emptyset$. The result then follows from the two lemmas. As I said this proof is for the general case of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n>1$ and is quite complicated. I don't know if for $n=2$ there's a simpler one which would adapt to the case of $X$. I can't understand how to adapt this one because it doesn't seem possible to define $\Delta(x_1',\dots,x_n')$ in $X$ in the first place.","['general-topology', 'metric-spaces', 'euclidean-geometry']"

2115138,Natural Metric on Tangent Bundle of Hyperbolic Plane?,"I am currently looking to understand the isometries of all the geometries described in W. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture . I struggle with the details of how to construct the metric of Thurston's 6th geometry, that of $\widetilde{SL(2,\mathbb{R})}$. From the material that I've read (two sources below), the idea is to identify the unit tangent bundle of the Hyperbolic Plane, $UT(\mathbb{H}^2)$, with the Projective Special Linear Group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ via fractional linear transformations and then pull-back the metric onto $\widetilde{SL(2,\mathbb{R})}$. The construction usually starts with a presentation of the Hyperbolic Plane as the Poincaré upper half-plane $\mathbb{H^2}=\{z \in\mathbb{C}: \text{Im}(z)>0\}$, endowed with the metric $ds^2_{\mathbb{H}}= dzd\bar{z}/\text{Im}(z)^2$. Equivalently, for for $z =x + iy$, we may write $ds^2 = (dx^2+dy^2)/y^2$. The Unit Tangent Bundle is then $UT(\mathbb{H^2}) = \{(z,\eta) \in T(\mathbb{H^2}) : \|\eta\|_\mathbb{H^2} = \|\eta\|_{Eucl.}/\text{Im}(z) = 1\}$, which is a circle bundle over $\mathbb{H^2}$. All sources so far seem to agree that there is a natural metric on $UT(\mathbb{H^2})$ induced by the one on $\mathbb{H^2}$ without mentioning what this metric is. Further reading on natural metrics for Riemannian manifolds seems to suggest there are many natural metrics; but only one can induce the right geometry for $\widetilde{SL(2,\mathbb{R})}$. Clearly, I will find different isometries if I use 
\begin{equation}
ds^2_{UT(\mathbb{H^2})} = (dx^2 + dy^2)/y^2 + d\phi^2,

2115253,Fitting $\cos(x)$ with a polynomial,"Consider the graph of $\cos(x)$ on the interval $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$. It looks very close to a parabola. I would like to find the parabola (or possibly family of parabolas) that ""fit"" the $\cos$ function the best on this interval. By ""fit"" the best, I mean I want to minimize the absolute area between the curves as much as possible, i.e. minimize $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}|\cos(x)-p_2(x)|dx,$$ where $p_2$ is a degree $2$ polynomial. My initial approach was to look at the Taylor approximation about $x=0$ of degree $2$ $$\cos(x)\approx1-\frac {x^2}2$$ The area between these curves is $2-\pi-\frac{\pi^3}{24}\approx0.15403$. Surely we can do better. I then looked at the interpolating polynomial through the points $(-\pi/2,0),(0,1),(\pi/2,0)$, which gives the function $1-\frac{4x^2}{\pi^2}$. The area between these two curves is $\frac23(\pi-3)\approx0.094395$. Better! Next, I tried looking what quadratic, with vertex $(0,1)$, satisfies $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\cos(x)-p_2(x)dx=0.$$ We then find that $p_2(x)=1-\frac{12(\pi-2)}{\pi^3}x^2$. So, there area between these two curves is $0$, but the absolute area is approximately $0.0539276$. Checking numerically, this appears to be the best-fitting parabola that has vertex $(0,1)$. Is the polynomial $p(x)=1-\frac{12(\pi-2)}{\pi^3}x^2$ the unique quadratic that minimizes $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}|\cos(x)-p_2(x)|dx,$$
  where $p_2$ is a degree two polynomial? Of course, it could be that there is a better-fitting polynomial that does not have its vertex at $(0,1)$. If not, then I simply ask: Find a quadratic polynomial $p_2(x)$ that minimizes $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}|\cos(x)-p_2(x)|dx.$$ Now, this can be extended to other degree polynomials. For example, the best fitting constant is $c=\sqrt{2}/2$, and that gives $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}|\cos(x)-\frac{\sqrt2}2|dx=2(\sqrt2-1)\approx0.82843.$$ This raises my more general question. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $p_n(x)$ be an $n$th degree polynomial. For each $n$, what polynomial minimizes  $$\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}|\cos(x)-p_n(x)|dx?$$","['integration', 'polynomials', 'optimization']"

2115380,Please critique my proof that $\sqrt{12}$ is irrational,"I would like critiques on correctness, conciseness, and clarity. Thanks! Proposition: There is no rational number whose square is 12 Proof: Suppose there were such a number, $a = \in \mathbb{Q}$ s.t. $a^2 = 12$. This implies that $\exists$ $m, n \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 12.$ Assume without loss of generality that $m,~ n$ have no factors in common. $\Rightarrow m^2 = 12n^2$. This implies that $m^2$ is even, and therefore that $m$ is even; it can thus be written $2k = m$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $m^2 = 12n^2 $ $\Rightarrow 4k^2 = 12n^2 $ $\Rightarrow \frac{k^2}{3} = n^2$ Because $n^2$ is an integer, it is clear that $3$ divides $k^2$ which imples that $k$ has $3$ or $\frac{k}{n}$ has a factor (because $\frac{k^2}{n^2}= 3$) Suppose that the former is true, and $3$ is a factor of $k$. Then $k = 3j$ for some integer j, which implies that $(3j)^2 = 3n^2$ $\Rightarrow 9j^2 = 3n^2 $ $\Rightarrow n^2 = 3j^2 $ $\Rightarrow n^2 = \frac{k^2}{n^2}j^2$ $\Rightarrow k = \frac{n^2}{j}$ but this implies that $j$ divides $n^2$, but $j$ divides $m$, and by initial assumption $n$ and $m$ have no factors in common, so this is a contradiction. Suppose now that $\frac{k}{n}$ is a factor of k. Then $k = \frac{k}{n}j$ for some integer $j$. Then $(\frac{k}{n}j)^2 = 3n^2$ which implies that $3j^2 = 3n^2 \Rightarrow j^2 = n^2 \Rightarrow j = n$. But this means that $n$ divides $m$, which again is a contradiction. Thus any rational representation of the number whose square equals $12$ leads to a contradiction and this number must therefore have no rational representation.","['real-analysis', 'proof-writing', 'rationality-testing', 'elementary-number-theory', 'solution-verification']"

If there are finite measures $(\mu_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $\mu = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\mu_n$, then $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite. Let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a real sequence. Then $$\mu := \sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \delta_{x_n}$$ is a measure on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}))$, where $\delta_x$ is the Dirca-measure in $x$. Furthermore, we have that $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite if and only if there exists no $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x_n = x$ for infinitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

2116016,Tautological 1-form: Lectures on Symplectic Geometry,"I am referring to page 10 of da Silva's Lectures on Symplectic Geometry. In particular, the exercise asks to show that $\alpha$ is tautological one-form if and only if for every one-form $\mu:X\to T*X$, we have $\mu^*\alpha=\mu$. Here $X$ is the base manifold, and $\alpha_p$ is a covector on the cotangent space of the cotangent bundle , i.e. $\alpha_p\in T_p^*(T^*X)$. I want to find a way to do this in coordinate-free and coordinate-dependent ways. What I am struggling to see is the meaning of $\mu^*$. Usually, e.g. in case of vector fields, the tangent map $T_pF$ induced by a smooth map $F$ has then effect on vector field $v$ such that
\begin{equation}
T_pF(v)(f)=v(f\circ F)
\end{equation} 
which can be written as pull-back map
\begin{equation}
T_pF(v)=v\circ F^*
\end{equation}
In other words, $f\circ F=F^*\circ f$. However in this case I cannot see what $\mu^*$ should be. I do know that one can see one-forms as just a map and hence we could imagine making a pull-back out of it. But it's a pullback of what to what? For coordinate-dependent one, I am essentially stuck at the step which sources like Wikipedia does:
\begin{equation}
\beta ^{*}\theta =\beta ^{*}(\sum _{i}p_{i}\,dq^{i})=\sum _{i}\beta ^{*}p_{i}\,dq^{i}=\sum _{i}\beta _{i}\,dq^{i}=\beta .
\end{equation}
I do not see at all why $\beta^*p_i=\beta_i$. I suspect this is again a problem of identifying which one-form belongs to which space, but I am not clear about this. Would be great to see if this problem can be solved in both ways.","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"

Furthermore the generic point $\eta \in \operatorname{Spec}(A)$ corresponding to the zero ideal is clearly smooth so density of $U$ follows. I'm having problems finishing the proof that $U$ is actually open. Since $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is catenary it follows by the dimension formula,

that $I$ has dimension $n-1$. Now this implies that the minimal number of generators of $I$ must be greater of equal to $n-1$.

2116652,Find the intersection multiplicity of $V(F)$ with each branch of $V(G)$ at the following points.,"Let $$F = 2X_0^2X_2 - 4X_0X_1^2 +X_0X_1X_2 +X_1^2X_2$$ and $$G = 4X_0^2X_2-4X_0X_1^2+X_0X_1X_2-X_1^2X_2$$
  Find the intersection multiplicity of $V(F)$ with each branch of $V(G)$ at $(0:1:0), (0:0:1), (1:1:1), (1:-1:2)$. Now what I'd normally do in an exercise of this kind is find a polynomial parametrization of $G$, say $\left(A_1(t_0,t_1), A_2(t_0,t_1),A_3(t_0,t_1)\right)$, then find for what values of $(t_0:t_1)$ I get those points, substituting the parametrization in $F$ and then putting the values of the parameters and find the multiplicity. Assume for example that for the points $(t_0: t_1) = (1:1), (1:-1)$ I get the point $(0:0:1)$, and after substituting on $F$ I get the expression
$$(t_0 - t_1)^3t_0^2t_1^3(t_0+t_1)$$
so I get one branch with multiplicity $3$ and another one with multiplicity $1$. The problem here is that I'm unable to find a polynomial parametrization of $G$ (though I know that the curve is parametrizable since I found a singular point and  $V(G)$ has degree $3$). So, is there a way to solve this without finding a parametrization or something? If there is, how?

2116671,Can Peano's Axioms be derived from ZFC without AOI?,"From ""Axiom of Infinity,"" Wikipedia : [T]here is a set I (the set which is postulated to be infinite), such
  that the empty set is in I and such that whenever any x is a member of
  I, the set formed by taking the union of x with its singleton {x} is
  also a member of I.[...] The infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that
  the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of
  specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the
  set N of all natural numbers. I presume that some version of Peano's Axioms will be derived in this process of extracting the natural numbers. It has been suggested by a contributor at sci.math (not a crank), that it may be possible to derive Peano's Axioms using ZFC without AOI. Can this be true? EDIT: Specifically, without citing AOI, can we prove the existence of a set $N$, function $S: N \to N$ and $0\in N$ such that: $\forall x,y \in N: [S(x)=S(y) \implies x=y]$ $\forall x\in N: S(x)\ne 0$ $\forall P\subset N: [0\in P \land \forall x\in P: [S(x)\in P] \implies P=N]$","['logic', 'elementary-set-theory']"
2116694,Asymptotic expansion of Polygamma functions,"According to Wikipedia, the log-Gamma and Polygamma functions have the following asymptotic behaviour on the real line for $x\to\infty$: $$\ln\Gamma(x) = (x - \tfrac{1}{2}) \ln(x) - x + \tfrac{1}{2}\ln (2\pi) + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B_{k+1}}{k(k+1)x^{k}} \\
\psi^{(0)}(x) \sim \ln(x) - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{B_k}{kx^k}\\
\psi^{(m)}(x) \sim (-1)^{m+1} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(k+m-1)}{k!} \frac{B_k}{x^{k+m}}\quad\text{for}\ m>0$$ The second one can be obtained from the first one by term-wise differentiation, and the third one from the second one by iterated term-wise iteration. The problem is that term-wise differention of asymptotic power series such as this is not valid in general. The book Asymptotic Expansions by A. Erdelyi mentions that one may perform term-wise differentiation of asymptotic power series like this one the function being expanded is a complex-valued function that is holomorphic on a suitably-shaped set (which $\ln\Gamma$ is). The proof uses Cauchy's integral formula and requires the power series expansion to hold uniformly . However, I am working on a computer-aided proof and for technical reasons, I would like to avoid talking about the complex-valued $\ln\Gamma$ function and uniform asymptotic expansions if possible. Is there any other way of obtaining the above results directly for the real $\psi^{(m)}$ functions? I already have the result
$$\ln\Gamma(x) = (x - \tfrac{1}{2})\ln(x) - s + \tfrac{1}{2}\ln(2\pi) + \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{B_{k+1}}{k(k+1)x^k}-\\\hskip-1em\frac{1}{m+1} \int_0^\infty \frac{B_{n+1}([t])}{(t+x)^{n+1}}\,\text{d}t$$
and, since the integral is ${\!}\in O(x^{-m-1})$, the above asymptotic expansion for $\ln\Gamma$, so I can use that – but is there any other way to get the other two expansions than the one described above? One way that I thought about is somehow directly estimating the growth of the derivatives of the integral, but I did not get very far with that.","['real-analysis', 'asymptotics', 'complex-analysis', 'polygamma', 'gamma-function']"

$A = [0, 1]\cup[0,\pi]$ and let $f:A\to \Bbb R$. Compute:
 $$\iint_Af(x, y) dx dy $$

Can this be explained by the fact that while both can describe the data adequately, $\max\{-X_{(1)},X_{(n)}\}$ is of lesser dimension and is thus minimal sufficient? Using the definition of minimal sufficiency ($T(X)$ is minimal sufficient if $T(x)=T(y) \iff \frac{\mathcal{L}(x;\theta)}{\mathcal{L}(y;\theta)}$ does not depend on $\theta$), I run into issues as with either choice of statistic, I need to analyze $$\frac{\mathbb{1}_{[\max\{-X_{(1)},X_{(n)}\}<\theta]}}{\mathbb{1}_{[\max\{-Y_{(1)},Y_{(n)}\}<\theta]}}$$ or

A tangent space at $p$ consists of a pair $(\mathrm T_pX,\jmath)$ satisfying the following data. $\mathrm T_pX$ is a vector space. For each chart $\bf x$ of $X$ about $p$, $\jmath_\mathbf{x}:\mathrm T_pX\to \mathbb R ^n$ is a linear isomorphism. $\jmath_\mathbf{y}\circ \jmath_{\mathbf{x}}^{-1}=\mathrm d_{\mathbf x p}(\mathbf y\circ \mathbf x^{-1}):\mathbb R ^n \cong \mathbb R^n$. These properties imply that if $(\mathrm T_pX,\jmath)$ and $(\mathrm T_p^\prime  X,\jmath ^\prime)$ are two tangent spaces of $X$ at $p$ then the composite $\jmath_\mathbf{x}^{-1}\circ \jmath_\mathbf{x}^\prime:\mathrm T^\prime_pX\cong \mathrm T_pX$ does not depend on the chart $\mathbf x$. From this the author concludes the tangent space is unique up to unique isomorphism ""by the universal property"".

where $(\theta,\varphi)$ parametrizes the circles $\mathbb T=S^1\times S^1$. However, because it is a compact manifold, we also know that it does not have a global symplectic potential i.e. $\omega=d\phi$ for some 1-form $\phi$, otherwise it will contradict Stokes' theorem. I originally suspected it may not admit symplectic structure because 'visually', I could draw a line from the centre (origin) of the torus such that it is tangential to the torus. A vector $p$ along this line would be 'tangential' to the tangent space at the point where the line touches the torus and hence it leads to degenerate 2-form. But I think there may be a hole in this argument.","['symplectic-geometry', 'differential-geometry']"
