4519048,Is there any method to compute $\frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right)$ other than complex numbers?,"In this couple of days, I need to know the high derivatives of $cos^kx$ whose power $k$ make the differentiation much harder.  Then I attempt to
use the identity $$
\cos x=\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{x i}+e^{-x i}\right),
$$ to expand it with Binomial expansion $$
\begin{aligned}
\cos ^{k} x &=\frac{1}{2 ^k} \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j}e^{x(k-j) i} e^{-x i j} 
=\frac{1}{2^{k}} \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j} e^{x(k-2 j) i}
\end{aligned}
$$ Differentiating it by $n$ times yields $$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right) &=\frac{1}{2^k} \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j}[(k-2 j) i]^{n} e^{x(k-2 j) i} \\
&=\frac{i^{n}}{2 ^k} \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n} e^{x(k-2 j) i} \\
&=\frac{i^{n}}{2^{k}} \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n}[\cos ((k-2 j) x)+i \sin ((k-2 j) x)]
\end{aligned}
$$ If $x$ is real , then comparing the imaginary and real parts on both sides yields \begin{equation}
\displaystyle \frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\displaystyle \frac{(-1)^{\frac{n}{2}}}{2^{k-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n}\cos((k-2j)x) \quad \textrm{ if n is even.}\\\displaystyle 
\frac{(-1)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{2^{k-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n} \sin((k-2j)x)  \quad \textrm{ if n is odd.}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation} For examples, When $n$ is even, $$
\left.\frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right)\right|_{x=0}=\frac{(-1)^{\frac{n}{2}}}{2^{k-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n}
$$ In particular, $$
\begin{aligned}
\left.\frac{d^{6}}{d x^{6}}\left(\cos ^{5} x\right)\right|_{x=0}&=\frac{(-1)^{3}}{2^{4}} \sum_{j=0}^{2}\binom{5}{j}(5-2 j)^{6} \\
&=\frac{1}{16}\left[5^{6}+5 \cdot 3^{6}+10 \cdot 1^{6}\right] \\
&=1205
\end{aligned}
$$ When $n$ is odd, $$
\left.\frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right)\right|_{x=0}=0;
$$ $$\left.\frac{d^{n}}{d x^{n}}\left(\cos ^{k} x\right) \right|_{x=\frac{\pi}{4} }= 
\frac{(-1)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}{2^{k-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{\left\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\right\rfloor}\binom{k}{j}(k-2 j)^{n} \sin \frac{(k-2 j) \pi}{4} $$ Can we find its closed form without using the complex numbers?","['calculus', 'binomial-theorem', 'derivatives', 'complex-numbers']"
4519061,The sum of $n$ terms in $1 \cdot 2+2 \cdot 3+3 \cdot 4+\ldots$,"I am just confused, considering we can take $1 \cdot 2$ as the first term then we get the $n$ th term as $n(n+1)$ so the sum of $n$ terms would be $\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$ + $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ but let's assume $0 \cdot 1$ as the first term then the $n$ th term becomes $(n-1) \cdot n$ and so it's summation becomes $\frac{n(n+1) (2n+1)}{6} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ but it's the same summation as above but the results are different what am I doing wrong?","['summation', 'recreational-mathematics', 'sequences-and-series']"

Clearly, $$\pi/2 \le x \le 3\pi/2\tag{1}$$ Subtracting $\pi$ , we get: $$-\pi/2 \le x - \pi \le \pi/2$$ Now, the term $(x-\pi)$ had come in the range of $\sin^{-1}(x)$ . Hence, $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x))=x-\pi$ for all $x\in[\pi/2,3\pi/2]\tag{2}$ Once more consider the inequation (1): $$\pi/2 \le x \le 3\pi/2$$ Multiplying this by $(-1)$ , we get; $$-\pi/2 \ge -x \ge -3\pi/2$$ Adding $\pi$ in this gives: $$\pi/2 \ge \pi-x \ge -\pi/2;$$ which can be re-written as; $$-\pi/2 \le \pi-x \le π/2$$ Now, the term $(\pi -x)$ has come within range of $\sin^{-1}(\sin(x))$ .

4519079,"Showing that a map $\operatorname{Div}(X) \to \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ is surjecitve (Gortz, Algebraic Geometry)","I'm reading the Gortz's Algebraic Geometry, proof of the Proposition 15.26 and stuck at understanding that some map appearing in the proposition is surjective.
Let $X$ be an absolute curve ; i.e., a non-empty noetherian scheme with irreducible components $X_i$ ( $1\le i \le n$ ) satisfying following equivalent condtions (Gortz, Prop.15.1) (i) For every closed point $x \in X$ , $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,x} =1$ (ii) The closed irreducible subsets of $X$ are the $X_i$ and the closed points of $X$ .
(iii) $\operatorname{dim}X_i = 1$ for all $i$ . Let $C^{1}$ be the set of points $x\in X$ such that $\operatorname{dim}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}=1$ and let $j_x : \operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x} \to X $ be the canonical morphism of $x\in C^{1}$ .
Note that $C^{1}$ is precisely the set of closed point of $X$ (If needed, I will upload detail). Then Gortz claims that next homomorphism of abelian groups : $$ \Psi : \operatorname{Div}(X) \to \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})$$ $$ D \mapsto \Sigma_{x\in C^{1}}  j_{x}^{*}(D)$$ is isomorphism, where $\operatorname{Div}(X)$ is the Cartier divisors and $j_x^{*} : \operatorname{Div}(X) \to \operatorname{Div}(\operatorname{Spec} \mathcal{O}_{X,x})$ is the inverse image of cartier divisor (c.f. Gortz's book p.312) Note that $\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ since for $x \in C^{1}$ , $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ is a local noetherian ring of dimension $1$ . (His book Exercise 11.18) I don't know explicit isomorphism. I want to get explicit map, for later usage. Now, let $\mathcal{K}_X$ be the sheaf of total fractions( or called sheaf of meromorphic functions) of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ . For the surjectivity, he argues that To show that surjectivity we first recall that $\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}=\mathcal{K}_{X,x}$ and that $\Gamma(U, \mathcal{K}_X) = \operatorname{Frac}(\Gamma(U, \mathcal{O}_{X}))$ for every open affine subset $U$ of $X$ (Remark 11.23, $X$ is noetherian). Thus it suffices to show that for $f\in (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}$ there exists an open affine neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and $g \in (\operatorname{Frac}\Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_X))^{\times}$ such that $g_x = f$ and such that $g_y \in \mathcal{O}_{X,y}^{\times}$ for all $y\in U$ , $y\neq x$ . My question is, why the condition is sufficient for the surjectivity of the $\Psi$ ? My first attempt is, let $(\overline{f}_x)_{x\in C^{1}} \in \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x})= \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}(\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}= \bigoplus_{x\in C^{1}}(\mathcal{K}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times} 
$ ( $f_x \in (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x})^{\times}$ ). Then by the above condition, for each $x\in C^{1}$ , there exists an open affine neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ and $g_x \in (\operatorname{Frac}\Gamma(U_x,\mathcal{O}_X))^{\times} = \Gamma(U_x, \mathcal{K}_X)^{\times}$ such that $(g_x)_{,x} = f_x$ and such that $(g_x)_{,y} \in \mathcal{O}_{X,y}^{\times}$ for all $y \in U_x$ with $y\neq x$ . I could show that $\{ U_x\}_{x\in C^{1}}$ forms an open cover of $X$ (If needed, I will upload proof). Now consider $D := (U_x , g_x)_{x\in C^{1}}$ . Then my question is, Q.1) $D \in \operatorname{Div}(X)$ ; i.e., $D$ forms a Cartier divisor on $X$ ? Q.2) $\Psi(D) = (j_x^{*}(D))_{x\in C^{1}} = (\overline{f}_x)_{x\in C^{1}} $ ? To show Q.2), fix $x_0 \in C^{1}$ . We need to show that $j_{x_0}^{*}(D) = \overline{f_{x_0}}$ . Note that $j_{x_0}^{*}(D) = j_{x_0}^{*}((U_x, g_x)_{x\in C^{1}})
                          := (j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_x), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_x}(g_x))_{x\in C^{1}} 
                           = (j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0})) \in \operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0})  $ , where $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}} : \mathcal{K}_X \to j_{x_0,*}\mathcal{K}_{\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}}$ is an extension of $j_{x_0}^{\flat} : \mathcal{O}_X \to j_{x_0,*}\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}}$ and the final equality is true since $j_{x_0}$ is a homeomorphism onto the subspace which is the intersection of all open subsets of $X$ which contains $x_0$ (c.f.Gortz, p.69), so $j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0})$ forms an open cover of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ . I asked that what is an explicit isomorphism $\operatorname{Div}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ . My question about Q.2) is, upto this explicit isomorphism, $(j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}))$ sends to $\overline{(g_{x_0})_{,x_0}}$ ? If so, then since $(g_{x_0})_{,x_0} = f_{x_0}$ as above, maybe we are done. Furthur progress : Let $Y_0 : =\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}$ . Note that $\operatorname{DivCl}(Y_0) =0$ ( c.f. Gortz, p.318, Exercise 11.18-(a) ) ; i.e., every Cartier divisor on $Y_0$ is principal. So, there exists a homomorphism $ \eta : \operatorname{Div}(Y_0) \cong \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times})$ (c.f. Gortz, p.301, (11.11.2)) defined as follows : For every divisor $(Y_0, f) \in \operatorname{Div}(Y_0)$ , $\eta ( (Y_0, f)) : = f + \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times}) 
=f + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} $ . Now let's go back to the above question. Note that $(j_{x_0}^{-1}(U_{x_0}), \overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}))$ is a principal divisor on $Y_0$ . So it sends via $\eta$ to $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} \in \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times})$ . So, it suffices to show that upto isomorphism ( since $X$ is noetherian ; c.f. Gortz, p.301, Remark 11.23) $$\operatorname{Div}(Y_0) \cong \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{K}_{Y_0}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y_0,\mathcal{O}_{Y_0}^{\times}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}))^{\times}/ \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times} \cong (\mathcal{K}_{X,x_0})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}
 $$ , $\overline{j_{x_0}^{\flat}}_{,U_{x_0}}(g_{x_0}) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ sends to $(g_{x_0})_{,x_0} + \mathcal{O}_{X,x_0}^{\times}$ . To sum it up, next question is true? Q. For the canonical map $j_x : Y:= \operatorname{Spec}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}) \to X$ and an open (affine) neighborhood $U \ni x$ and $g \in \mathcal{K}_{X}(U)^{\times}$ , upto isomorphism : $$ \Gamma(j_x^{-1}(U),\mathcal{K}_{Y}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y}^{\times}) 
=\Gamma(Y,\mathcal{K}_{Y}^{\times})/ \Gamma(Y,\mathcal{O}_{Y}^{\times}) \cong (\operatorname{Frac}(\mathcal{O}_{X,x}))^{\times}/ \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times} \cong (\mathcal{K}_{X,x})^{\times}/\mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}
 $$ , $\overline{j_{x}^{\flat}}_{,U}(g) + \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ sends to $g_{x} + \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\times}$ , where $g_x$ is the germ in $\mathcal{K}_{X,x}^{\times}$ at $x$ ? C.f.

4519185,Hypothesis of Grönwall's inequality (Evans version),"I hope this question has not alredy been asked: unfortunately there are many versions of this inequality and is difficult to find exactly the version I'm looking for. In Partial Differential Equations, Evans (Appendix B2), there is the proof of the following inequality: Grönwall's inequality: Let $\eta$ be a nonnegative, absolutely continuous function on $[0,T]$ , which satisfies: $$\eta'(t)\leq\phi(t)\eta(t)+\psi(t) \qquad a.e. \ t$$ where $\phi,\psi$ are nonnegative summable functions on $[0,T]$ , then: $$\eta(t)\leq e^{\int_0^t\phi(s)\ ds}\Big[\eta(0)+\int_0^t\psi(s) \ ds\Big] \qquad \forall t\in[0,T]$$ Proof: $$\frac{d}{ds}\Big[\eta(s)e^{-\int_0^s\phi(r)\ dr}\Big]=e^{-\int_0^s\phi(r)\ dr}[\eta'(s)-\phi(s)\eta(s)]\leq e^{-\int_0^s\phi(r)\ dr}\psi(s)$$ By integration on $[0,t]$ , with $t\in[0,T]$ , we have: $$\eta(t) e^{-\int_0^t\phi(r)\ dr}\leq \eta(0)+\int_0^t e^{-\int_0^s\phi(r)\ dr}\psi(s) \ ds\leq \eta(0)+\int_0^t\psi(s) \ ds$$ where the last inequality follows by the nonnegativeness of $\phi,\psi$ . I can't understand how the nonnegativeness of $\eta$ is used in the proof. Is this hypothesis not necessary? I need to use it for a positive $\eta$ so this hypothesis is not a problem. It is just to be sure that I am not missing something important in the proof of the inequality.

4519201,Smooth family of diffeomorphisms gives a complete vector field?,"Let $M$ be a manifold and $U\subseteq \mathbb R$ an open interval containing $0$ . Consider a smooth map $\Phi:U \times M\rightarrow M$ such that $\Phi(t,-):M\rightarrow M$ is a diffeomorphism, for every $t\in U$ $\Phi(0,-)$ is the identity morphism. Then, for every $x\in M$ , we have a path $\Phi(-,x):(U,0)\rightarrow (M,x)$ representing a tangent vector $v_x=\Phi(-,x)_*(\frac{d}{dt})\in T_xM$ and so we get a vector field $v:M\rightarrow TM$ . This vector field has itself a maximal flow $\Psi:V\rightarrow M$ (defined on some open $V\subseteq \mathbb R\times M$ containing $\{0\}\times M$ ) and so I define the following $$\mathcal D=\{t\in\mathbb R|(t,x)\in V\forall x\in M\}$$ so $\mathcal D$ is the maximal domain on which every maximal integral curve is defined. My question is In the context of this question, is $\mathcal D$ an open neighborhood of $0$ ? For those interested, here is where this question comes from: I'm reading about the internal tangent space to a diffeological space . I'm particularly interested in the tangent space at the identity of the diffeological space $\text{Diff}(M)$ . The construction of the internal tangent space (ITS, for short) is here and here . In general, the ITS at some point $x$ of the diffeological space $X$ is linearly generated by pairs $(p,u)$ , with $p: (W,0)\rightarrow(X,x)$ a plot for $X$ (with $W$ open neighborhood of $0\in\mathbb R$ ) and $u\in T_0W$ . For every smooth $f:(W',0)\rightarrow (W,0)$ we identify $(pf,u)$ with $(p,f_*(u))$ . In here , the author proves that if $G$ is a diffeological group, then every tangent vector $v\in T_gG$ ( $g$ any point $\in G$ ) can be represented by a single pair $(p,u)$ like above. In particular, this applies to $\text{Diff}(M)$ , so every $v\in T_\text{id}\text{Diff}(M)$ is represented by some plot $p:U\rightarrow \text{Diff}(M)$ sending $0$ to $\text{id}$ and a tangent vector $u\in T_0U$ . Now, a plot $p$ is like above a smooth family $U\times M\rightarrow M$ of diffeomorphisms, in particular given the pair $(p,u)$ we can associate a vector field as $$x\mapsto p(-,x)_*(u)\in T_xM$$ so that we have a map $$\gamma:T_\text{id}\text{Diff}(M)\rightarrow \mathfrak X(M)$$ If $M$ is compact, then $\gamma$ is an isomorphism (proved in the articles above). In general, I want to understand the image of $\gamma$ for a non-necessarily compact manifold. For now, my guess is that the image of $\gamma$ are those vector fields for which $\mathcal D$ (defined as above) is an open neighborhood of $0$ .","['vector-fields', 'differential-geometry']"

My question is how can we determine which quotients of $\mathbb{H}^2$ by subgroups of $\Delta (p,q,r)$ (where $\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} < 1$ ) form surfaces of certain genus $g$ ? In particular, as a result of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we have that any finite quotient $G$ of $\Delta (p,q,r)$ satisfies $$
g = 1 + \frac{1}{2}|G|(1-(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r})).
$$ Would this imply, for example, that there are no hyperbolic triangle groups which give rise to a genus 1 surface as a quotient of $\mathbb{H}^2$ by a subgroup of the triangle group? Any help would be much appreciated.","['group-theory', 'geometry', 'quotient-spaces']"

4519347,Why is this integral not finite?,"This question is related to a previous one, I asked here , though I'm not going to explicitly state their relationship. Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a smooth compactly supported function and let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be two non-zero real numbers with non-zero solutions to the equation $a_1x + a_2y = 0 $ for $(x,y) \in [0,\infty)^2$ . I want to prove that the following integral below is not necessarily finite: $$\int_{ [0,\infty)^2 } f(a_1x+ a_2y) \ dx \ dy $$ The thing is that I ""sort of"" understand the intuition of why this is so, but I'm struggling to express it rigorously (as are the texts I've read claiming this fact ...) Let $K$ the set of $(x,y) \in [0,\infty)^2$ such that $a_1x + a_2y = 0$ . Because $K$ contains a non-zero vector, we can scale that non-zero vector by positive scalars and get a new non-zero solution for each scale. Therefore, $K$ is a ray. Now let $(x_t,y_t) \in [0,\infty)^2$ such that $a_1x_t +a_2y_t = t $ where $t$ lies in the support of $f$ . Then we should have something like \begin{align*}
\int_{ [0,\infty)^2 } f(a_1x+ a_2y) \ dx \ dy & \geq \int_{K + (x_t,y_t)} f(a_1x+ a_2y) \ dx \ dy \newline
&  = \int_{K+(x_t,y_t)} f(t) \ dx \  dy
\end{align*} and we should have that the last integral is not finite. Of course, the last two integrals don't make sense so the inequality doesn't make sense. But it feels like it's capturing the idea. I would appreciate some help in completing my idea into a rigorous proof or by being given a totally different (and rigorous) argument.","['distribution-theory', 'multivariable-calculus', 'improper-integrals', 'real-analysis']"

4519429,Hard? problem with the largest square [closed],"Closed . This question needs to be more focused . It is not currently accepting answers. Want to improve this question? Update the question so it focuses on one problem only by editing this post . Closed 1 year ago . Improve this question Let me start by saying that this post is not likely to be a question. I am writing it because I found a mathematical problem that I found interesting enough to share with others. It seems to me that it is rather difficult and thus I rather not expect an answer. What is it about? Take any two irrational numbers (e.g., the canonical $e$ and $\pi$ ) and on both positive semi-diagonals of the coordinate system, instead of the natural numbers, start writing out their consecutive digits. This is how we label the axes. Then let's put a black square on the lattice points when its ""digital coordinates"" have a sum modulo $2$ equal to $1$ , and let's not give it when it is equal to $0$ . As you can see, the squares begin to cluster into larger groupings, and within these groupings into larger squares (as the picture below). The question is: What is the largest area of a square that can be obtained in this way in a ""grid of digits modulo"" for two specific irrational numbers? Of course, I can choose two artificial irrational numbers in such a way as to elevate the area of such squares to infinity (again, picture below), but putting two specific irrational numbers in it makes the whole problem quite interesting, because we have a predetermined ""grid of digits modulo"" that we can't change, and which doesn't seem to have such simple patterns of distribution of small squares (by the fact that we have irrational numbers). My intuition pushes me, in the direction of saying that such a maximum field will exist, although I could be wrong (due to the fact that the digits seem to behave randomly in this case, and over time you will come across larger and larger groupings of squares if you just wait long enough. Such a hypothesis. Then one could ask about the expected value of the area of a random square spanning maximally the local group, etc.). I am simply curious about your impressions and whether problems of this type appeal to you. Regards.",['discrete-mathematics']

So you start with the denominator which you want to be small as possible, hence by $|\cos(x)|=0$ which gives $x=-\frac{π}{2}$ which then you find out that in the numerator it outputs a negative number which pretty much concludes that is the least number you could get, which was $-9.$ And I checked on desmos and it was right.

Here is my attempted proof. We will show that $f$ is bijective by showing that it is both surjective and injective. Fix $b \in B$ . Then $h(b) = a$ for some $a \in A$ . Applying $f$ , we obtain $f(a) = f(h(b)) = b$ , so $f$ is surjective. Now, suppose $f(a) = f(a')$ for some $a,a' \in A$ . Applying $g$ , we obtain $g(f(a)) = g(f(a'))$ and hence $a = a'$ , so $f$ is injective and hence bijective. Now, it suffices to demonstrate that $g = h$ .

Will I have to find the possible domain of the equation and figure out the range by using the possible domain values? For example, here's an equation: x 2 + y 2 = 100 And as for the method of identifying equations by just looking at the equation structure, do we use this method because that's the result we get most of the time and because of it's fast usage?

\big( d | Y \times Y \big) ( p, q) := d(p, q) \ \mbox{ for all } p, q \in Y,

How to show that these two topologies on $Y$ are the same? My Attempt: Let $V$ be a $\mathscr{T}$ -open set of $Y$ , and let $y \in Y$ . Then there exists an open set $U$ of $X$ such that $V = Y \cap U$ , and our $y \in U$ of course, which implies the existence a real number $\epsilon_y > 0$ such that $B_d \left( y, \epsilon_y \right) \subset U$ , that is, for any point $x \in X$ such that $d(x, y) < \epsilon_y$ , we also have $x \in U$ ; therefore for any point $x \in Y \subset X$ in particular such that $\big( d | Y \times Y \big) (x, y) < \epsilon_y$ , we  have $x \in U$ and hence $x \in Y \cap U = V$ , which implies that $$
B_{d | Y \times Y} \left( y, \epsilon_y \right) \subset V,

V = \bigcup_{y \in V} B_{d | Y \times Y} \left( y, \epsilon_y \right),

\mathscr{T} \subset \mathscr{T}^\prime. 
$$ Am I right? Conversely, let $V^\prime$ be a $\mathscr{T}^\prime$ -open set of $Y$ , and let $y^\prime \in V^\prime$ . Then there exists a real number $\epsilon_{y^\prime} > 0$ such that $$

U^\prime := \bigcup_{ y^\prime \in V^\prime} B_d \left( y^\prime, \epsilon_{y^\prime} \right). 
$$ This set $U^\prime$ is an open set of $X$ of course and $V^\prime = Y \cap U^\prime$ , thus showing that $V^\prime$ is $\mathscr{T}$ -open, which implies that $$

The expansions for $e^{3/n}$ , or even $e^{p/q}$ , are not known in general, and it is a strange miracle that we can figure out any of them at all... Euler first derived the continued fraction for $e$ and $e^{1/n}$ . The expansion for $e^{2/n}$ is viewable on the web, but I have not been able to find a proof of this beautiful fact. This original text from Euler proves that, for real $s$ : $$\begin{align}\tag{1}e^{2/s}&=1+\frac{2}{s-1+}\frac{1}{3s+}\frac{1}{5s+}\cdots\\e^{1/s}&=1+\frac{1}{s-1+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{3s-1+}\cdots\end{align}$$ It derives the expansion for $e^{1/s}$ from that for $e^{2/s}$ by means of his ""interpolation"" formulae: $$\begin{align}a+\frac{1}{m+}\frac{1}{n+}\frac{1}{b+}\frac{1}{m+}\frac{1}{n+}\frac{1}{c+}\cdots&=\frac{1}{mn+1}\left((mn+1)a+n+\frac{1}{(mn+1)b+m+n+}\frac{1}{(mn+1)c+m+n+}\cdots\right)\\A+\frac{1}{a+}\frac{1}{m+}\frac{1}{n+}\frac{1}{b+}\cdots&=A+\frac{mn+1}{(mn+1)a+n+}\frac{1}{(mn+1)b+m+n+}\cdots\\a+\frac{1}{b+}\frac{1}{c+}\cdots&=a-n+\frac{mn+1}{m+}\frac{1}{n+}\frac{1}{\frac{b-m-n}{mn+1}+}\frac{1}{m+}\frac{1}{n+}\frac{1}{\frac{c-m-n}{mn+1}+}\cdots\end{align}$$ Which all have nice special cases for $m=n=1$ . Wikipedia claims that in fact: $$\tag{$\ast$}e^{2/s}=1+\frac{1}{\frac{s-1}{2}+}\frac{1}{6s+}\frac{1}{\frac{5s-1}{2}+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{\frac{7s-1}{2}+}\frac{1}{18s+}\frac{1}{\frac{11s-1}{2}+}\frac{1}{1+}\cdots$$ Which I'd like to understand. First note that, by equivalence transformation (multiply by $2,1/2,2,1/2,\cdots$ ) the a first try might be to convert $(\ast)$ into: $$e^{2/s}=1+\frac{2}{s-1+}\frac{1}{3s+}\frac{1}{5s-1+}\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}+}\frac{1}{2+}\frac{1}{\frac{7s-1}{4}+}\cdots$$ Which unfortunately doesn't work out. Also, although two $1s$ have clearly been interpolated somehow to get $(\ast)$ , we can't directly employ any of the standard results shown above, since, instead of $a,1,1,b,1,1,...$ it is of the form $a,b,c,1,1,d,e,f,1,1,...$ . If we try to realise $(1)$ as an interpolation, using the middle formula, we need to solve $2a+1=s-1\implies a=\frac{s-1}{2}$ , $2b+2=3s\implies b=\frac{3s-2}{2}$ , etc., to get: $$e^{2/s}=1+\frac{1}{\frac{s-1}{2}+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{\frac{3s-2}{2}+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{1+}\frac{1}{\frac{5s-2}{2}+}\cdots$$ Which seems better, but is still not quite right. I'm convinced the answer is going to be a simple transformation: the denominators of $(\ast)$ are of the form $\frac{x-1}{2},2x$ for $x$ the denominator in $(1)$ . The presence of a $2$ -multiplier and a $1/2$ -multiplier suggests some simple cancellation. However, the two interpolating $1s$ are causing me a headache.

The subcript denotes the order of the respective integer, so $i_1<i_2<i_3<i_4<i_5$ . We apply the randomized quicksort algorithm to the unordered array and would like to know the probability $P(A_{24})$ that two integers $s_2$ and $s_4$ are being compared. (Note that every item in the array is chosen as pivot with equal probability) In our lecture the professor simply says that if we think about it for a while it becomes trivial that $P(A_{24})=\frac{2}{4-2+1}=\frac{2}{3}$ . However it didn't.... I would like to have a mathematical frame to argue that $P(A_{24})=\frac{2}{3}$ . My attempt: So far I have only assumed that we already have a discrete probability space $(\Omega,P)$ where $\Omega=\{i_1,i_2,i_3,i_4,i_5\}$ and $B_i$ denotes the event that $s_i$ has been chosen as pivot element. So I simply collect all the events where $s_2$ or $s_4$ are the pivot at some stage during the algorithm and get \begin{align*}
&P(A_{24})=\\
&P(B_2)+P(B_4)+P(B_1)P(B_2\mid B_1)+P(B_5)P(B_2\mid B_5)+P(B_5)P(B_4\mid B_5)+P(B_1)P(B_4\mid B_1)\\

\end{align*} If we use some intuition and the fact that every element has the same probability to be chosen as pivot we get (conditional) probabilities \begin{align*}
&\dots=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{4}\\

&=\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{15}=\frac{2}{3}.
\end{align*} Though this seems much clearer to me why we get $\frac{2}{3}$ I am not sure about the actual definition of the probability space.

4519950,What do the Fibers tell us about torsion? (Geometric Intuition),"Edit: I provided a full answer to the question based on my current understanding of the topic. Any form of proof-reading would be highly appreciated. Alternative answers are also welcome. Inspired by this wonderful post: I am trying to gain a geometric intuition on what torsion does to the Fibers of the Tangent Bundle along a suitable (closed) curve and how that relates to the ""non-closing parallelograms"", if at all. Let's again work on the sphere $S^2$ with its poles removed - call it $S_0^2$ - and its tangent bundle $\pi: \mathcal{T}(S_0^2) \rightarrow S_0^2$ . We define the trivial connection on the Fibers $T_p S_0^2 \cong \mathbb{R}^2$ to be the one where a vector is to be parallel transported if the angle between the vector and the latitude is kept fixed during the navigation. This leads to torsion but no curvature (see post above). Main Question: What exactly does the connection do to the Fibers (tangent planes) which allow us to see this geometrically? More specifically: if $\gamma$ is a closed curve on $S^2_0$ and $\phi_{\gamma} : T_p S_0^2 \rightarrow T_p S_0^2$ is the automorphism produced by the connection (i.e. by the parallel transport of $T_p S_0^2$ along $\gamma$ ), how does $\phi_{\gamma}$ look like? One may be tempted to say that $\phi_{\gamma} = id$ since all $\underline{angles}$ are preserved ( no curvature !) but then again, where exactly is the torsion ? Related Questions (Optional): Is the torsion of a connection related to the torsion of a curve (see picture below), or is the choice of words, a misnomer ? For some context, if we instead had the Levi-Civita Connection on $\mathcal{T}(S^2)$ , my understanding is that we would simply get that $\phi_{\gamma}$ is a rotation, correct? (I.e. the holonomy group is $SO(2)$ since $S^2$ is orientable) Is looking at the Fibers (vector spaces) even the right approach? For example, Roger Penrose defines torsion (in abstract index notion) as the ""commutator"" of the covariant derivative acting on a scalar function $\Phi$ (which is precise and clear but not very visual).

Because $\delta \leq \delta_1$ then $0<|x-a|<\delta_1$ which means that $|f(x)-L|< \epsilon /2$ . Similarly, because $\delta \leq \delta_2$ then $0<|x-a|<\delta_2$ , so $|g(x)-L|< \epsilon/2$ . Therefore, $$|f(x) - L+g(x)-L)| \leq |f(x)-L| + |g(x)-L| < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon. $$ My doubt I do not see how my proof has anything to do with the condition $f(c) \neq g(c)$ .

Well, let's do the same thing again, namely notice that it's a composition and break it down. So now let $\alpha(x)=\ln x$ and $\beta(x)=4x-x^2$ . These two functions we know how to differentiate!

We both concluded that this statement should not be generally true because even in a single metric space the balls around different point need not be homeomorphic, so one would have to specify which balls they are talking about in the framing of the above claim.

Suppose that for every morphism $f\colon i\to j$ in $I$ I have a morphism of topoi $$(f_\ast,f^\ast)\colon \mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{C}_i)\to\mathbf{Sh}(\mathcal{C}_j),$$ which is something like a lax $2$ -functor (for $i\xrightarrow{f}j\xrightarrow{g}k$ I have chosen equivalences $(g\circ f)^\ast=f^\ast\circ g^\ast$ and $(g\circ f)_\ast= g_\ast\circ f_\ast$ satisfying 'reasonable compatibility conditions').

From the integral question provided, we know that we need to do $$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{10\sin x}{2x}dx$$ where it means $5\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin x}{x}dx$ after simplifying, but the problem is how to integrate it.

For example, $\sin x = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$ , when you divide it by $x$ , it is $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}$ , and after you integrate it, it is $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)(2n+1)!}$ . But what's next, here is where I am currently stucking at. I found out that this formula is actually a bit like the taylor series of $\arctan $ , just need to remove the $(2n+1)!$ and they are the same.

4520315,Constructing functions involving existential quantifiers: issues of one input being mapped to many outputs,"I was wondering if someone could help me formalize the below construction. Suppose I know that some set $T$ is dense on the $\mathbb R$ eal closed interval $[a,b]$ . The definition that I would like to work with is: $T \subseteq [a,b]$ is dense in $[a,b]$ if for any $c \lt d \in [a,b]$ , there is a $t\in T$ such that $t \in (c,d)$ . Next, suppose I have the following set: $R=\{(c_n,d_n)\ |\  \exists n \in \mathbb N: c_n=b-\frac{b-a}{n} \text{ and } d_n=b-\frac{b-a}{n+1}\}$ . I want to use the following function: $G:R \to T$ , where the mapping rule is $(c_n,d_n) \mapsto x_n$ such that $x_n \in T \text{ and } x_n \in (c_n,d_n)$ . However, I am unsure whether or not the function $G$ exists. The main problem I see here is that, for a given input $(c_n,d_n)$ , how do I know that $G$ only maps to a single element (a requirement for a function )? By assumption, there is at least one such element $x_n \in T \text { and } x_n\in (c_n,d_n)$ , but there may be many (infinitely) more. As far as I know, the implied existential statement, ""... $\exists t \in T$ ..."" has no upper bound on the number of objects satisfying the given property...it simply asserts that there is at least one. Is the only way around this issue to invoke the Axiom of Choice, which will allow me to posit the existence of a choice function? In particular, this choice function $K_n$ would allow me to choose precisely one of the possibly many $t \in T$ that lay within $(c_n,d_n)$ . If this is true, would it be appropriate to recast my function $G$ in the following way? $G:R \to T$ , where the mapping rule is $(c_n,d_n) \mapsto K_n\left((c_n,d_n) \right)$ Are there other ways to go about this construction that do not require the Axiom of Choice? 1st Edit For completeness, with this updated version of $G$ , we can show that the set $T$ is, at a minimum, countably infinite. To see this, we will show that there is a bijection from a subset of $T$ to $\mathbb N$ . Firstly, because $\forall n \in \mathbb N: (c_n,d_n) \cap (c_{n+1},d_{n+1}) = \emptyset$ , we must have that $G$ is injective. Also, $\forall n \in \mathbb N: [c_n,d_n] \subset [a,b]$ , which means that $R \subseteq [a,b]$ (so $G$ is well-defined). Next, by construction, it is straightforward to see that $R$ , the domain of $G$ , can be put in a bijection with $\mathbb N$ in the obvious way, which, together with the injectivity claim, shows that $G[R]$ can be put in a bijection with $\mathbb N$ (once again, in the obvious way). But $G[R] \subseteq T$ , so we see that we have a subset of $T$ which can be put in a bijection with $\mathbb N$ . Therefore, $T$ is, at a minimum, countably infinite. More generally, we show that any set that is dense in a non-empty subset of $\mathbb R$ is at least countably infinite. 2nd Edit In the comments, Asaf Karagila stated that to prove a set is simply 'infinite' does not require the Axiom of Choice. Here is how. In this context 'infinite' (rather than 'Dedekind Infinite') simply means 'not infinite' where we define 'finite' as: A set $A$ is finite if there exists a bijection $f: A \rightarrow \{1,...,n\},$ for some positive integer $n$ Returning to our initial problem, to show that $T$ is infinite, we will proceed by contradiction. Suppose, instead, that $T$ is finite. Therefore, there exists some $N$ such that $T$ can be put in a bijection with the set $\{1,2,\cdots,N\}$ . Now, consider the following length $\ell  = \frac{b-a}{N+1}$ . Consider the following list of subintervals: \begin{align}s_1=\left(a,a+1\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1}\right),s_2=\left(a+1\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1},a+2\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1}\right),\cdots, \\s_N=\left(a+(N-1)\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1},a+N\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1}\right), s_{N+1}=\left(a+N\cdot \frac{b-a}{N+1},b\right)\end{align} . In each of these intervals, there is a $t_j \in s_j$ . All of these subintervals are disjoint. Therefore, there are a total of $N+1$ elements in $T$ , which is a contradiction. $T$ must be infinite...no Axiom of Choice required.","['first-order-logic', 'axiom-of-choice', 'functions', 'set-theory']"

The polar coordinate transformation $g$ does not in this case define a diffeomorphism of an open set in the $(r,\theta)$ plane with $W$ .  However, $g$ does define a diffeomorphism of the open set $U=(0,a)\times (0,2\pi)$ with the open set $$V=\{(x,y)\mid x^2+y^2<a^2\text{ and }x<0\text{   if   }y=0\}$$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ .

Then, $W=V\cup T$ and $V\cap T=\emptyset.$ So, by Theorem 13.3(d), $\int_W x^2y^2 = \int_V x^2y^2 + \int_T x^2y^2 - \int_{V\cap T} x^2y^2$ . Since $T$ and $V\cap T$ have measure zero, $\int_T x^2y^2=0$ and $\int_{V\cap T} x^2y^2=0$ by Theorem 11.3.

$$ How I got stuck : I feel that the general way to prove such problems is in two steps: Degenerate the desired isomorphism to the zeroth degree and prove the zeroth degree version. Use the composition theorem for derived functors (i.e. $\mathbf{R}(GF) \cong \mathbf{R}G \circ \mathbf{R}F$ ) to upgrade to the derived version. At least for most exercises and theorem I have met, the thing works smoothly: Example 1 : To show $$
\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(B,C)) \cong \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A \otimes^{\mathbf{L}}_R B, C )  \quad\quad (\star),
$$ we first degenerate it to the zeroth degree as $$
\mathrm{Hom}_R(A, \mathrm{Hom}_R(B,C)) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_R(A \otimes_R B, C).
$$ This is the clear adjoint isomorphism. Then we view both sides as composed functors in $B$ . Then if $A$ is a projective complex and $C$ is an injective complex , we check the conditions of the composition theorem of derived functors hold. So we upgrade both sides to the derived version. Then we take projective resolution of $A$ and injective resolution of $C$ in general, we have the final isomorphism $(\star)$ . Example 2 : We can also prove the Shapiro's lemma in group cohomology by this method, by first degenerate to the canonical isomorphism $$
\mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathbb{Z}, \mathrm{Ind}^G_H(-)) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_H(\mathbb{Z}, -)
$$ and upgrade it to $$
\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_G(\mathbb{Z}, \mathrm{Ind}^G_H(-)) \cong \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_H(\mathbb{Z}, -),
$$ by further noticing $\mathrm{Ind}^G_H(-)$ is an exact functor. Then taking the $n$ -th cohomology, we get the Shapiro's lemma. But my experience fails when facing the exercise above, since the isomorphism on the zeroth degree level, i.e. commuting tensor product with Hom in such a weird (for me) way is quite out of reach for me. Yet I have no idea how to tackle in another approach.

\mathbf{L}f^{\ast} \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_R(A,B) \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom}_S(\mathbf{L}f^{\ast}A, \mathbf{L}f^{\ast} B).
$$ And similar to the previous exercise, I also got stuck at the very first beginning, feeling confused on the degenerated version. Or maybe my two-step approach has some hidden troubles that I haven't realized? Or is it quite limited in the application of derived category? Quite frustrated! :( Thank you all for helping, commenting or answering, or even reading such a long post! :)","['homological-algebra', 'abstract-algebra', 'derived-categories']"
4520375,The catch in proving that a singleton is a Borel set?,"Let $\Omega= (0,1]$ . Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the collection of all open interval in $(0,1]$ .
By open interval in $(0,1]$ I mean any interval of the form $(a,b)$ , where $a\geq 0$ and $b\leq 1$ .
Let $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ be the smallest sigma-algebra that contains $\mathcal{C}$ . We call this sigma-algebra a Borel-sigma algebra. Now, let us we have to prove that the singleton $\{0.7\}$ is in $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ . In order to prove it, we use the following result: \begin{equation}
\{0.7\}=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big[(0.7-1/n, 0.7+1/n)\cap(0,1]\Big].
\end{equation} The above result is based on the fact that \begin{equation}
(0.7-1/n, 0.7+1/n)\cap(0,1]\in\mathcal{C}\in\sigma(\mathcal{C}), \mbox{for}\ n=2,3,4...
\end{equation} Therefore the intersection of $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big[(0.7-1/n, 0.7+1/n)\cap(0,1]\Big]$ would be contained in $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ . However, here is the catch, for $n=2$ , we have \begin{equation}
(0.7-1/n, 0.7+1/n)\cap(0,1]= (0.2, 1.2)\cap(0,1]=(0.2, 1]\notin \mathcal{C}
\end{equation} Therefore the quantity $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big[(0.7-1/n, 0.7+1/n)\cap(0,1]\Big]$ does not have to be contained in $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ . Now, can anybody help me to figure out how my argument is not valid?","['measure-theory', 'lebesgue-measure', 'borel-measures', 'borel-sets', 'probability']"
4520385,"Solving $\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{xt}{x^2+t^2},\ x(0)=1$","I have started self-studying differential equations and I have come across the following initial value problem $$\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{xt}{x^2+t^2}, \quad x(0)=1$$ Now, since $f(t,x)=\frac{xt}{x^2+t^2}$ is such that $f(rt,rx)=f(t,x)$ for every $r\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ , we can use the change of variables $y=\frac{x}{t}$ to rewrite it in the form \begin{align}
y+t\frac{dy}{dt} &=\frac{t^2 y}{t^2(1+y^2)} \\

To separate the integration interval into two parts: $(0,\frac12]$ and $[\frac12,+\infty)$ , for the second one, doing a substitution $x\mapsto \frac1x$ is my first thought(possibly not valid). Thought 2 :
It looks 100%, even 90%, like pseudo elliptic integral (its anti-derivative is elementary). I think this one is elementary as well. THOUGHT 3 : Maybe this is a very STUPID question.

Prove that $f(A)$ is also a strong measure $0$ set. Show that every perfect set $A\subset [0,1]$ (not empty) contains a set $F$ homeomorphic to the Cantor set and therefore $A$ can't be a strong measure $0$ set.

4520791,"Discussion of Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology.","In Example 2, section 7 on page 45 of Munkres’ Topology, the problem is stated as follows. $$\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+ \text{ is countably infinite.}$$ First, he defines a function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+\rightarrow A$ , where $A$ the subset of $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ consisting of pairs $(x,y)$ for which $y\le x$ by the equation $$f\left(x,y\right)=(x+y-1,y),$$ and he defines a function $g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ by the formula $g\left(x,y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-1\right)x+y$ . Then he leaves it to the reader to show that $f$ and $g$ are bijections. Though there is a similar question, unfortunately, it isn’t in detail. So I have attempted a detail one. The following is my attempt to proof of bijections. Let $f\left(x,y\right)=\left(x^\prime,y^\prime\right)$ . If $x=1$ , then $f\left(1,y\right)=(y,y)$ ; hence $y^\prime=x^\prime$ .
If $x>1$ , then $x-1>0$ and $x+y-1>y$ . So $y^\prime<x^\prime$ . Thus, $\forall\left(x,y\right),\ f\left(x,y\right)\in A$ . Let $f\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=f(x_2,y_2)$ .
Then $\left(x_1+y_1-1,y_1\right)=(x_2+y_2-1,y_2)$ implying that $y_1=y_2$ ; and hence $x_1=x_2$ .
Thus, $f\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=f\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow\left(x_1,y_1\right)=(x_2,y_2)$ . So, $f$ is injective. Let $x^\prime,y^\prime$ be given point in $A$ . Since $y^\prime\le x^\prime$ , there exists a positive integer $x \in \mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $$ x^\prime+1=x+y^\prime, \text{ i.e.}, x^\prime=x+y^\prime-1.$$ Therefore, for every $(x^\prime,y^\prime)\in\ A$ , there exists $(x,y) \in \mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $f(x,y)=(x^\prime,y^\prime).$ Hence $f$ is surjective; and hence bijective. Next consider the function $g:A\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ .
Since $A\subset\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ , it is clear that $\forall\left(x,y\right)\in A,\ g\left(x,y\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(x-1\right)x+y\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ for $2\ |\ (x-1)x$ . Suppose $\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq\left(x_2,y_2\right)$ . Clearly we have $y_1\le x_1,\ \ y_2\le x_2$ . If $x_1=x_2$ , then $y_1\neq y_2$ and vice-versa. In these cases, $\frac{1}{2}\left(x_1-1\right)x_1+y_1\neq\frac{1}{2}\left(x_2-1\right)x_2+y_2$ .
If $x_1=y_2$ , then $x_2>y_2=x_1>y_1$ and vice-versa. In these cases, $\frac{1}{2}\left(x_1-1\right)x_1+y_1=\frac{1}{2}\left(y_2-1\right)y_2+y_1<\frac{1}{2}\left(x_2-1\right)x_2+y_2$ and vice-versa. Hence, in either case, it is clear that $\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow g\left(x_1,y_1\right)\neq g(x_2,y_2)$ . That is, $g\left(x_1,\ y_1\right)=g\left(x_2,y_2\right)\Longrightarrow\left(x_1,y_1\right)=\left(x_2,y_2\right)$ .
Thus, g is injective. Let $z$ be given point in $\mathbb{Z}_+$ .
We can choose $x$ in $\mathbb{Z}_+$ such that $2z \le (x+1)x$ . Then, $2z \le (x+1)x \implies \left(x-1\right)x+2y \le (x+1)x \implies y\le x$ . Thus, we can choose $(x,y)\in A$ for which $y\le x$ such that $2z=\left(x-1\right)x+2y$ .
Therefore, for every $z\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ , there exists $\left(x,y\right)\in A$ for which $y\le x$ such that $g\left(x,y\right)=z.$ Hence $g$ is surjective; and hence bijective.
It follows that $g\circ f:\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_+$ is bijective. Hence $\mathbb{Z}_+\times\mathbb{Z}_+$ is countably infinite.∎ I wonder if my attempt is valid or not, if not, please suggest me.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

4520988,Self contained exposition of second order Fuchsian ODEs,"I am teaching a graduate course in Complex Analysis.  I would like students to give an oral presentation at the end of the term on a topic which we did not cover in the lecture.  So I am putting together a list of textbook chapters and expository papers on various topics. One topic which I think is very nice, and uses many of the tools we will cover in the course, is the theory of second order Fuchsian ODEs.  However, I have been unable to find an exposition of this topic which is ""self contained"" in the sense that it is relatively short (10 to 15 pages) and assumes only the background of a one semester complex analysis course (basically they will know all the machinery leading up to the Residue theorem). Can anyone recommend such a resource?","['complex-analysis', 'monodromy', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'reference-request']"
4521021,Radius and interval of convergence for $\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n\ln^2(n)}$,"I was requested to show radius and interval of convergence for the series $$\sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n\ln^2(n)}$$ and was wondering if my result is correct. This was my approach. $i)$ $a_n := \frac{x^{2n}}{n\ln^2(n)} = \frac{(x^2)^n}{n\ln^2(n)}$ . We have $$|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| = \frac{|(x^2)^{n+1}|}{(n+1)\ln^2(n+1)}\times\frac{n \ln^2(n)}{|(x^2)^n|}$$ $$= \frac{n\ln^2(n)}{(n+1) \ln^2(n+1)}|x^2|$$ Because $\lim_{n\to\infty} (\frac{\ln x}{\ln (x+1)})^2 = 1$ (through L'Hopital) we have $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n\ln^2(n)}{(n+1) \ln^2(n+1)}= \lim_{n\to\infty} \Big((\frac{\ln(n)}{ln(n+1)})^2\Big) \times \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{n}{n+1} =1 \times 1=1$$ and therefore $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to |x^2|$ when $n \to \infty$ . $ii)$ $|x^2|=x^2 <1 \iff x \in(-1, 1) \equiv |x| <1$ . This already implies a radius of convergence of $1$ . $iii)$ $x=1 \implies a_n = \frac{1}{n\ln^2(n)}$ . Since $$\int_{2}^\infty \frac{1}{x \ln^2x} dx= \lim_{t\to\infty}\int_2^t \frac{1}{u^2}du \tag{$u=\ln x$}$$ $$= \lim_{t\to\infty} (-\frac{1}{t} + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}$$ we know the series will converge when $x=1$ via the integral test. For $x=-1$ , $a_n=\frac{((-1)^2)^n}{n \ln^2 n} = \frac{1}{n \ln^2 n}$ , the same case we already examined. Therefore,the interval of convergence is $[-1, 1]$ . Final answer . $R= 1, I=[-1, 1]$ .

Let $f^*=\inf_{x\in\mathbb{R}}f(x)$ , then there exists a sequence $\{x_n\}$ such that $f(x_n)\to f^*$ . There are two cases. Case 1. If $\{x_n\}$ has a limit point $x^*$ , then $f(x^*)=f^*$ , so $x^*$ is a global minimizer and $f'(x^*)=0$ . Case 2. If $\{x_n\}$ does not have a limit point, then $|x_n|\to\infty$ . By Mean Value Theorem, there exists $\xi_n$ such that $f(x_n)-f(0)=f'(\xi_n)x_n$ . Thus $|f'(\xi_n)|=|f(x_n)-f(0)|/|x_n|\to0$ . In $\mathbb{R}^n$ , the analysis of case 1 is the same, but case 2 does not generalize naturally, because MVT becomes $f(x_n)-f(0)=\nabla f(\xi_n)^\top x_n$ .

Deduce that $\mathbb{R}$ is not countable.

4521207,Are all principal curvatures equal at an isotropy point?,"Suppose $M$ is a hypersurface embedded in a Riemannian manifold $(N, g)$ and there exists $p\in M$ s.t. for any two tangent vectors $u,v\in T_pM$ we can find an isometry $\phi$ of $M$ fixing $p$ s.t. $d\phi_p u=v$ . Because there is no preferred direction, it seems intuitive that all principal curvatures of $M$ at $p$ are equal. An identity that would immediately prove this hypothesis would be $$ s \phi_* v=\phi_* sv,$$ Where $s$ is the shape operator of $M$ . This equation is equivalent to $$h(\phi_* v, \phi_* w) = g(s \phi_* v, \phi_*w) = g(\phi_* sv,\phi_*w) = g(sv,w)=h(v,w),$$ Where $h$ is the scalar second fundamental form of $M$ . Since $h$ is related to the Levi-Civita connection, which is invariant under isometries, I would expect $h$ to also be preserved under $\phi$ , but the fact that we also need to consider the connection in the ambient manifold $N$ confounds me.

For any $S$ with $|S| \leq 1$ ( $|S|$ being the carnality of $S$ ) we have $f(S) \in \{0, 1\}$ . There exists infinitely many $S$ (not depending on $f$ ) such that $|S| = 2$ and $f(S) = 1$ .
