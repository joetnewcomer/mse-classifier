644468,Ring of formal power series over a field is a principal ideal domain,"If $K$ is a field, any non-zero ideal in the ring of formal power series $A=K[[X]]$ is of the form $AX^n$ with $n\geq 0$, so $A=K[[X]]$ is a principal ideal ring. I can't see why. Usually when we consider the ring of polynomials $B=K[X]$, the ideals are the multiples of any fixed polynomial $P(x)\in K[X]$.

644719,Which of the following subsets of $M_n(\mathbb{R})$ are compact (NBHM),"Following is a list of problems from an exam for admission into Ph. D program. I have just compiled all previous questions on compactness of certain subsets of matrices  and i tried to work out . I would be thankful if some one can check the solutions and please suggest if there are any better ways to do and if the solution is wrong please let me know what could be done for them. $\{ A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \text { A is real symmetric Matrix with eigenvalues $|\lambda|\leq 2$}\}$ Solution: We see that any real symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. So, I believe each element in $S$ is similar to some $\begin{bmatrix} a& 0\\0&b\end{bmatrix}$ where $|a|\leq 2, |b|\leq 2$ in which case we have boundedness. I am not so certain about the closedness I believe it is closed though i can not write it in detail. $\{ A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \text { A is diagonalizable Matrix with eigenvalues $|\lambda|\leq 2$}\}$ Solution: We see this is same as above set $S$ and so should be compact. $\{\text {unitary matrices in $M_2(\mathbb{C}$)}\}$ Solution: My justification for this makes no sense.. I would edit this once i got some clear idea.. $\{ A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \text { det (A)} =1\}$ Solution: We can consider $\begin{bmatrix} 1& n\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$ to be in given set and $n$ can be as large as i wish.. so this set is not bounded so is not compact. $\{\text {Trace (A) : $A\in M_n(\mathbb{R})$ is orthogonal}\}\subset \mathbb{R}$ Solution: I have no idea. only thing i could see is that determinant is $\pm 1$ but i do not see any properties regarding Trace. $\{ A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \text { A is invertible diagonal Matrix}\}$ Solution: We can consider $\begin{bmatrix} n& 0\\0&n\end{bmatrix}$ for $n\neq 0$to be in given set and $n$ can be as large as i wish.. so this set is not bounded so is not compact. $\{ A\in M_n(\mathbb{R}) : \text { A is upper triangular Matrix}\}$ Solution: We can consider $\begin{bmatrix} 1& n\\0&1\end{bmatrix}$ to be in given set and $n$ can be as large as i wish.. so this set is not bounded so is not compact.

I read the following proof, but I still want to know why either the $I_q$'s are the same or are disjoint. If someone could provide a nice explanation it would be greatly appreciated. The following is the proof I found on this page - Any open subset of $\Bbb R$ is a at most countable union of disjoint open intervals. [Collecting Proofs] Let $U \subseteq R$ be open and let $x \in U$. Either $x$ is rational or irrational. If $x$ is rational, define
\begin{align}I_x = \bigcup\limits_{\substack{I\text{ an open interval} \\ x~\in~I~\subseteq~U}} I,\end{align}
which, as a union of non-disjoint open intervals (each $I$ contains $x$),  is an open interval subset to $U$. If $x$ is irrational, by openness of $U$ there is $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $(x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \subseteq U$, and there exists rational $y \in (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon) \subseteq I_y$ (by the definition of $I_y$). Hence $x \in I_y$. So any $x \in U$ is in $I_q$ for some $q \in U \cap \mathbb{Q}$, and so
\begin{align}U \subseteq \bigcup\limits_{q~\in~U \cap~\mathbb{Q}} I_q.\end{align}
But $I_q \subseteq U$ for each $q \in U \cap \mathbb{Q}$; thus
\begin{align}U = \bigcup\limits_{q~\in~U \cap~\mathbb{Q}} I_q, \end{align}
which is a countable union of open intervals.","['measure-theory', 'real-analysis', 'analysis']"

645028,Raising $e$ to the power of a matrix,"Does there exist a definition for matrix exponentiation?
If we have, say, an integer, one can define $A^B$ as follows: $$\prod_{n = 1}^B A$$ We can define exponentials of fractions as a power of a radical, and we even have the following definition of the exponential: $$e^z = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n!}$$ which comes from a Taylor Series for the function $\exp(z)$ . Now, a problem seems to arise when we attempt to calculate $\exp(A)$ , where $A$ is an $n$ x $n$ (square) matrix. We cannot define it as multiplication a ""matrix number of times"" as this makes no sense. The only reasonable definition that could work is the latter definition (the infinite series): $$e^A = 1 + A + \frac{AA}{2!} + \frac{AAA}{3!} + \frac{AAAA}{4!} + \cdots$$ where we can define matrix exponentiation to the power of an integer, which is all that is required here.

A box in $\mathbb R^d$ is a cartesian product $B=I_1 \times...\times I_d$ of $d$ intervals. An elementary set is any subset of $\mathbb R^d$ which is the union of a fnite number of boxes. Show that if $E,F \subset \mathbb R^d$ are elementary sets, then $E \cup F$, $E \cap F$, $E \setminus F$ and $E \Delta F$ are elementary sets. If $x \in \mathbb R^d$ show that the translate $E+x=\{y+x : y \in E\}$ is an elementary set. Attempt at a solution If $E$ and $F$ are elementary sets then $E=B_1 \cup ... \cup B_k$ and $F=S_1 \cup ... \cup S_n$ union of $k$ and $n$ boxes respectively , so $E \cup F=(B_1 \cup ... \cup B_k) \cup (S_1 \cup ... \cup S_n)$ the union of $k+n$ boxes, i.e., $E \cup F$ is an elementary set by definition. I don't know how to show that the intersection and $E \setminus F$ are elementary. If I could prove these, then $E \Delta F= (E \setminus F) \cup (F \setminus E)$ is union of elementary sets which is an elementary set. For the translation, I know that $E=B_1 \cup ... \cup B_k$, so I can write $E+x=B_1+x \cup ... \cup B_k+x$. For each $B_i, 1\leq i \leq k$, $B_i=I_1 \times ... \times I_n$, so $B_i+x=I_1+x \times ... \times I_n+x$ and if an interval $I$ has endpoints $a<b$, then $I+x$ is an interval of endpoints $a+x<b+x$, so $E+x$ is a finite union of boxes, i.e., $E+x$ is an elementary set. I would appreciate some help with the two remaining proofs.",['real-analysis']

645171,Counting the Number of Integral Solutions to $x^2+dy^2 = n$,"It is a well known result that the number of integer solutions $(x,y), x>0, y\ge 0$ to $x^2+y^2 = n$ is $\sum_{d|n}\chi(d)$, where $\chi$ is the nontrivial Dirichlet character modulo $4$ such that $\chi(d)=1$ if $d\equiv 1\pmod{4}$, $\chi(d)=-1$ if $d\equiv 3\pmod{4}$, and $\chi(2k)=0$. My question: Can we extend this to the integers of other imaginary quadratic fields? How many integer solutions are there to $x^2+2y^2 = n$ and $x^2+3y^2 = n$? Can this be generalized? To derive the result for $x^2+y^2=n$, one extends the notion of a Euler product to the Gaussian integers $\mathbf{Z}[i]$. Suppose $a_n$ is the number of solutions, so $a_n$ is the number of ideals $(\alpha)\in\mathbf{Z}[i]$ such that $N(\alpha)=n$. Using well known characterization of irreducibles in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$, we get $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{n^s}=\prod_{(\pi)}\frac{1}{1-N(\pi)^{-s}}=\left(\frac{1}{1-2^{-s}}\right)\prod_{p\equiv 1\pmod{4}}\left(\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\right)^2\prod_{q\equiv 3\pmod{4}}\left(\frac{1}{1-q^{-2s}}\right). $$ After algebraic manipulation followed by introducing the zeta function, we can write the RHS as $$ \zeta(s)\left(\prod_{p\equiv 1\pmod{4}}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\right)\left(\prod_{q\equiv 3\pmod{4}}\frac{1}{1+q^{-s}}\right)=\zeta(s)\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-\chi(p)p^{-s}}=\zeta(s)\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\chi(n)}{n^s}$$ due to standard results on multiplicativity. Finally, due to Dirichlet convolution, we can match up coefficients to what we originally started with to get the desired $a_n = \sum_{d|n}\chi(d)$. In the case of $x^2+3y^2=n$, we would work over $\mathbf{Z}[\omega]$. The irreducibles here are precisely $1-\omega$, $q\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ where $q$ is a rational prime, and $\pi$ such that $p = \pi\bar\pi$ where $p\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ is a rational prime. Similarly in $\mathbf{Z}[\sqrt{-2}]$, the conditions for irreducibility depend on the residue class of the norm modulo $8$. Thus, using a Dirichlet character modulo $3$ or modulo $8$, could we also extend the Euler product to these rings - thus allowing to answer such questions? Finally, can this be generalized to the integers of $\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$ in general so as to give a way to count the number of solutions to $x^2+dy^2=n$ in terms of Dirichlet characters? Would this work differently in quadratic extensions with different class numbers? Moreover, there are $\varphi(m)$ characters modulo $m$, so which one would we use? I hope the jumble of thoughts and questions above are not completely ignorant, naive, and/or trivial (or completely bogus). Any ideas/thoughts/answers are greatly appreciated. EDIT: Lemma 3.25 in David Cox's Primes of the form $x^2+ny^2$ actually gives a formula for this sort of computation: Let $m$ be a positive odd number relatively prime to $n>1$. Then, the number of ways that $m$ is properly represented by a reduced form of discriminant $-4n$ is $2\displaystyle\prod_{p|n}\left(1+\left(\frac{-n}{p}\right)\right).$ While Cox states that he doesn't deal with number of representations by forms in his book, the proof of this is dealt with in the exercises.","['number-theory', 'quadratic-forms', 'analytic-number-theory', 'algebraic-number-theory', 'representations-by-quadratic-forms']"

645236,Problem on functions,"I have this question: Suppose the function $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ satisfies $$ |f(x) - f(y)| = \frac {|x-y|}{2}.$$ Prove that $f$ has an unique fixed point i.e. there exists a unique $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$. I found out the following: 1. $f$ is continuous at every point. Because for any $y_0$, given any $\epsilon \gt 0$ choosing $\delta = 2\epsilon$, we have $|y-y_0| \lt \delta \implies \frac {|y-y_0|}{2}=|f(y)-f(y_0)|\lt \epsilon$. 2. $|\frac {f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}| = \frac {1}{2}$ for $h \neq 0$. Now, if $f$ is increasing or decreasing, then we conclude that $f^{(1)}(x)$ exists and is equal to $\frac {1}{2}$ and $-\frac {1}{2}$ according as $f$ is increasing or decreasing. So, $f(x)=\frac {x}{2} + c$ or $-\frac {x}{2} +c$ for some constant $c$. Therefore we have $f(2c) = 2c$ and $f(2c/3)=2c/3$ according as $f$ is increasing or decreasing, and these are unique. Now I'm stuck up in solving the more general case when $f$ is neither increasing or decreasing. Any hint would be appreciated.","['functions', 'calculus', 'real-analysis']"

  Show that, for all $n\in\mathbb N$ and $\lambda>0$, $$\lambda P[|X|^*_n\ge \lambda ]\le 12 E[|X_0|]+9E[|X_n|].$$ This problem comes from Klenke's probability textbook (11.1.1), and follows the section on Doob's inequalities and Doob's decomposition. We define $$X^*_n = \sup\{X_k : k\le n\}.$$ My thoughts: For simplicity, consider just the case where $X_n$ is a submartingale. Then we can write $X_n=M_n+A_n$, where $M_n$ is a martingale and $A_n$ is an increasing predictable process (so a positive submartingale). Then $$P[|X|^*_n\ge \lambda ] \le P[|A|^*_n+|M|_n^*\ge \lambda ] \le P[|M|_n^*\ge a\lambda ]+ P[|A|^*_n\ge (1-a)\lambda ],$$ where $a$ will be chosen later. Combining this with the inequality $$\lambda P[|Y|^*_n\ge \lambda ]\le E[|Y_n|]$$ (which applies with $Y_n$ is a martingale or positive submartingale) gives a bound in terms of $A_n$ and $M_n$, which is not quite what we want.

If $\sum_0^n f^i(x) = S_n(x)$, then My conclusions: For each $x$, $S_n(x) \rightarrow \frac{1}{1-f}$ since $|f(x)|<1$. If there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $|f|\leq 1-\epsilon$, then $|\frac{1}{1-f}| \leq \epsilon^{-1}$, which, since $\mu(X)<\infty$, means that $|S_n|$ is dominated by an $L^1$ function.

This is what I arrived at as a way out of it.  But it does pose a small issue. Requirement : To prove that $(x+y) \in \bf{\mathbb{N}}; \quad \forall{x,y\in \bf{\mathbb{N}}} $ If $ y = 1,$ then $(x+1) = x' \in \mathbb{N} $ since $x\in \mathbb{N}$ by Axiom 2(see below). 
If not by Theorem 3, $\exists {y_1} \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $y = y_1'$ and $(x+y)=(x+ y_1') = (x+y_1)'$ If  $y_1 = 1$ then $(x+y) = (x+1)' = (x')' \in\mathbb{N} $ since the successor of the successor of $x$ must be a natural number since $x$ is one. Continuing in this fashion for some $n$ we have that $y_n = 1$ and  $(x +y) = (((x +y_n)')'...)'= (((x')')'...)' \in \mathbb{N}  $ But is $n$ finite or countable? And so how long is the process? Will that be a problem? Is it possible to think that as soon as $y$ is prescribed the ensuing process is finite. Please comment. Any help is appreciated.","['definition', 'foundations', 'number-theory']"

645954,Simpler way to evaluate the Fourier transform of $\exp\left(i e^x\right)$?,"I have the task to evaluate $|a(k)|^2$ with
$$ a(k) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \!dx\,\exp\left(i k x + i e^{x}\right).\tag{1}$$ The integral in (1) can be evaluated explicitly via the substitution $y=e^{x}$ with the result
$$ a(k) = e^{-\pi k/2} \Gamma(ik)$$
where $\Gamma(x)$ is the Gamma-function. Using the result $$\Gamma(ix)\Gamma(-ix) = \frac{\pi}{x \sinh(\pi x)} \tag{2}$$
we find
$$|a(k)|^2 = \frac{2\pi}{k(e^{2\pi k} -1)}.$$ Does anybody know a direct way to evaluate $|a(k)|^2$ possibly using some methods of complex analysis such that one does not need to know the special property (2) of the Gamma-function (and even the Gamma-function itself)? Edit1: (see also edit 2 about the question of convergence)
There was a question about possible problems with the convergence of the integral. Let me indicate in what sense one can give a meaning to the formulas above. Eq. (1) converges in the half-plane $\text{Im}(k) < 0$. Of course, we want in the end $k \in \mathbb{R}$. We should understand this as a limes
$$a(k)=\lim_{\eta\downarrow 0}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \!dx\,\exp\left(i k x - \eta x + i e^{x}\right)$$ and we ask for the value of
$$
 |a(k)|^2= \lim_{\eta\downarrow 0}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \!dx\,dy\,\exp\left(i k x - \eta x + i e^{x}
 -i k y - \eta y - i e^{y}\right)
$$ To show that (1) is indeed convergent for $ \text{Im}(k) < 0$, we employ the substitution $y= e^x$ and obtain
$$a(k)= \int_0^\infty\!dy\,e^{i y} y^{i k -1}.$$
The magnitude of the integrand is $\sim \exp[-\text{Im}(y)]$  for $|y|\to \infty$ and the integrand  has no singularities. So we can deform the integration contour along the positive imaginary axis with $y=iz$ and
$$a(k) = i\int_0^\infty\!dz\, e^{-z} (iz)^{ik-1} $$
which is convergent for $\text{Re}(ik -1)= -\text{Im}(k) -1 >-1$. Edit2: (about the convergence) As the question about the convergence of the integral as defined arises again and again, here is some explanation without using complex analysis (which might be simpler to understand for some). Note that as before, we understand $a(k)$ as $\lim_{\eta\downarrow 0}a(k-i \eta)$. Starting with Eq. (1) we employ the change of variables $y=e^{x}$. The limits of the resulting integral are $y\in[0,\infty)$ which we divide in two integrals which we will analyze individually,
$$a(k) = a_1(k) + a_2(k) = \int_0^1\!dy\, y^{ik-1} e^{iy} + \int_1^\infty\!dy\, y^{ik-1} e^{iy}.$$ It is only for the part $a_1(k)$ where we need to care about the limit $\eta\downarrow 0$. In particular, we can perform an integration by parts (integrating $y^{ik-1}$) and obtain
$$a_1(k) = -i k^{-1} e^{i} + k^{-1}\lim_{y\to 0} (i e^{iy} y^{ik}) - k^{-1}\int_0^1\!dy\, y^{ik} e^{iy} =-i k^{-1} e^{i}- k^{-1}\int_0^1\!dy\, y^{ik} e^{iy} .$$
For the vanishing of the limit, we have used the replacement $k\mapsto k-i\eta$ with $\eta \downarrow 0$. The rest is finite as $| y^{ik} e^{iy}| =1$. The second part $a_2(k)$ is finite even for real $k$ (understanding the integral as an improper integral). To see that explicitly, we introduce $z(y)= y + k \log y$. For $y> y^* =\text{max}(1,-k)$ the variable change $z(y)$ is monotonously increasing. So we can write
$$a_2(k) = \int_1^{y^*}\!dy\, y^{ik-1} e^{iy} + \underbrace{\int_{z^*}^\infty\!dz\, \frac{e^{iz}}{y(1+k/y)}}_{a_3(k)}.$$
The first term is trivially finite. The second term, we split in real and imaginary part. We show that the imaginary part is finite, the real part is analogous. We split the integral in parts with $z \in [ m \pi , (m+1) \pi]$ with $b_m= \int_{m\pi}^{(m+1)\pi}\!dz\,\sin(z)/y(1+k/y)$. We set $m^* = \lceil z^*/\pi\rceil$. We have
$$\text{Im}\,a_3(k) = \int_{z^*}^{m^* \pi} \!dz\,\frac{\sin z}{y(1+k/y)}
+ \sum_{m=m^*}^\infty b_m.\tag{3}$$
We have that $(-1)^m b_m \geq 0$ thus $b_m$ is alternating in sign. Moreover,
$$|b_m| \leq \frac{1}{m(1+k/m\pi)} \leq \frac1m \to 0 \quad (m\to\infty),$$
so the series in (3) converges due to the Leibniz criterion.","['definite-integrals', 'complex-analysis']"

646067,Combinatorics: Guarantee getting 10 out of 13 right as efficiently as possible (Stryktipset),"First, a little background ""Stryktipset"" is a popular form of football (soccer) gambling in Sweden, but I'm sure similar games exist in many other countries. The concept is simple: out of a list of thirteen games, the player needs to pick the correct winner, or whether the game ends in a draw. The notation for this is 1 for home team win, X for a draw, and 2 for an away win. The player competes against the player pool, where set percentages of the total prize pool gets divided among those who get 10, 11, 12 and 13 corretly picked games. A common way to play is through ""guarantees"" and ""semi-guarantees"", meaning that for every game, the player can choose to play all three alternatives, or at least two of them. So for instance, playing game 1 as 1X2, game 2 as X2 and the rest as ""single choice"", yields 3*2*(1^11) combinations, for 6 ways to get all 13 right, or 6 ""rows"", and thus a cost of 6 times the base cost. This is called an M, or Mathematical, system, whereas just picking one option per game is a ""single"". To the point Now, a common puzzle is ""what is the lowest amount of rows that guarantees the player 5 correct games?"" Many responders go by their gut feel of ""guaranteeing"" five games and then letting the remaining 8 be arbitrary, for 5^3 = 243 rows. But, if one plays just three singles that don't overlap, this turns out to be enough to guarantee at least 5 correct games. This can easily be seen by imagining one single with all 1's, one with all X's and one with all 2's. Naturally, at least one of the signs needs to show up at least five times. But what I wonder is this: What is the lowest amount of rows that guarantees 10 correct answers?","['gambling', 'combinatorics']"

I think one has to split the integrals to avoid the singularities and then show they are
alike without explicitly evalutating them. Note $$
\int_0^{2\pi} f(x) \mathrm{d}x
=
\int_0^\pi f(x) \mathrm{d}x
+
\int_\pi^{3\pi/2} f(x) \mathrm{d}x
+
\int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} f(x) \mathrm{d}x
$$ Explicit calculations one have $$
\int_0^{\pi/2} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = -1 + 2\log 2 \quad \, \quad
\int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = 1 \\
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = 1 + 4 K-2 \log 2 \quad \, \quad
\int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x = -1 - 4 K
$$ Where $K$ is Catalan's constant. Now the sum is of course zero, but is it possible to show this without evaluating $4$ integrals? The two first integrals I have been able to show $$
\begin{align*}
        \int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x 
    & = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} f(x) + f(\pi-x)\,\mathrm{d}x \\
    & = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\pi}^{3\pi/2} \log(1+\cos x)\sin x+ \log(1+\sin x)\cos x\,\mathrm{d}x \\
    & = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{-1} \log(1+u) + \log(1+u)\,\mathrm{d}x
      = 1
\end{align*}
$$ Is it perhaps possible to find $$
\int_{3\pi/2}^{2\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x + 
\int_{\pi/2}^{\pi} f(x)\mathrm{d}x
= -2 \log 2

646160,"On a *ringed space*, show that the non vanishing set of $f$ is open, and that it is invertible there","This is an exercise of Ravi Vakil that I solved by a very trivial argument without using the hint. For this reason I'm worried that I might have missed something. If $f$ is a function on a locally ringed space $X$, show that the subset of $X$ where $f$ doesn't vanish is open. (Hint: show that if $f$ is a function on a ringed space $X$, show that (sic) the subset of $X$ where the germ of $f$ is invertible is open) Solution: Assuming that the first sentence means ""$f$ is an element of $\mathcal O_X$"", and that $\mathcal O_X$ is a ring of continuous functions on $X$, we just pull back the closed set $\{0\}$ to $X$ via $f^{-1}$. Under a continuous function the pull back of a closed set is closed, and therefore the complement of the locus where $f$ doesn't vanish is closed. Questions: 1) is my solution correct? 2) I know it is true for the special example of schemes, but for a ringed space in general why is the locus of where a function $f$ doesn't vanish the same of where the germ of $f$ is invertible? The most I can say is that this is true for locally ringed spaces (and not for just ringed spaces as the hint suggests), because if the germ of a function is non-zero at a point $p$ in a locally ringed space $X$, $f_p$ can't belong to the maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_p$. For if it did, then under the homomorphism $ev_p: \mathcal O_{X,p} \rightarrow k$ the maximal ideal of $k$, which is $(0)$, would not pull back to $\mathfrak m_p$ (it would miss $f_p$).","['algebraic-geometry', 'schemes', 'ringed-spaces']"
646170,"Proving algebraically that $\mathbb RP ^3\cong SO(3,\mathbb R)$","I am giving a simple introductory course on algebraic geometry and I plan to mention that $$\mathbb RP ^3\cong SO(3,\mathbb R).$$ I know a rather simple proof of this  using the fact that $\mathbb RP^3$ is topologically a $3$-dimensional ball with an identification of opposite points on the boundary. I would like to know if one can prove this fact in some symmetric ""algebraic way"". $\bf Added.$ Giulio Bresciani made a good remark, that $SO(3,\mathbb R)$ is naturally an affine variety, and since $\mathbb RP ^3$ is projective, they are not isomorphic. In order to rectify this situation, let as compactify $SO(3,\mathbb R)$ by adding to it points on infinity (an empty set), by adding to $\mathbb R^9$ (where $SO(3,\mathbb R)$ sits) the space $\mathbb RP^8$. The new question is then: is there some nice birational map from $\mathbb RP^3$ to $SO(3,\mathbb R)$, which is as well a diffeo on the set of points.","['matrices', 'algebraic-geometry', 'projective-geometry']"

646228,"If $p$, $q$ are naturals, solve $p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2$.","In If $p,q$ are prime, solve $p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2$. , the author asks to solve the equation $p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2$ for primes $p$ and $q$. A proof is given that $p=7, q=3$ is the only solution. In this ""followup"", I would like to ask for a proof that does not depend on $p$ and $q$ being primes but allows arbitrary positive integers. I do have an elementary proof for the case in which $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime , but the case in which they aren't is giving me a hard time. Anyone here who can help? 9/12 update: As I commented, I may have been wrong when I claimed I had a proof for the case where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime, but it should be possible to prove with the additional condition $(p,q+1)=1$ (not $q-1$ as I had written in the comment). Here's the proof: Assume that $p$ and $q$ are positive integers such that
$$p^3-q^5=(p+q)^2\text{,}\tag{1} $$
$$(p,q)=1,\tag{2}$$
$$(p,q+1)=1.\tag{3}$$
Note that (1) implies that
$$q<p.\tag{4}$$
Evaluating (1) modulo $q$ gives $p^3\equiv p^2\pmod{q}$, so by (2), $p\equiv1\pmod{q}$, i.e. there exists $a\in\mathbb{N}$ such that 
$$p=aq+1.\tag{5}$$
Likewise, if we evaluate (1) modulo $p$, we get $-q^5\equiv q^2\pmod{p}$, so $p$ divides 
$q^5+q^2=q^2(q+1)(q^2-q+1)$ and thus by (2) and (3),
$$p\;|\;q^2-q+1.\tag{6}$$
Combining (5) and (6), we get that $p$ divides $q^2-q+1-aq-1=q(q-a-1)$ and therefore by (2),
$$p\;|\;q-a-1\tag{7}.$$
Note that, since the right-hand side in (6) is positive, $q-a-1$ must not be negative. On the other hand, (4) implies that it cannot be positive either, so it is $0$ and we have $a=q-1$ and therefore
$$p=q^2-q+1.\tag{8}$$
Now, substituting (8) in (1) and evaluating modulo $q^2$ gives $-3q+1\equiv1\pmod{q^2}$, i.e. $q^2$ divides $3q$ which forces $q=3$ and $p=7$.","['elementary-number-theory', 'diophantine-equations', 'number-theory']"
646257,Prove or disprove an inequality involving statistics,"Do we have any result in statistics like this: $$|\overline x - \mu_e| \leq \sigma$$ Here $\overline x$ denotes the usual mean of some given discrete observations, $\mu_e$ their median and $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the variables. I got this feeling because I found the following problem: There are $2n+1$ numbers such that $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq x_3 \cdots \leq x_{2n} \leq x_{2n+1}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} x_i =0$. Show that, $$ x_{n+1}^{2} \leq \frac {1}{2n+1} \sum_{k=1}^{2n+1} x_{k}^{2}$$ plus, $\overline x$ and $\mu_e$ are supposed to be measures of central tendencies and $\sigma$ is supposed to find out how variables are scattered from the mean. It would be really strange if two such values be more far than the average scattering of all variables. Though here are two questions, my priority is the first one. But that does not mean I would not appreciate any other methods of solving the second one. Thank you in advance!","['statistics', 'inequality', 'probability', 'probability-theory']"
