1727835,Bell number as summation of Stirling numbers of the second kind,"A different summation formula represents each Bell number as a sum of
  Stirling numbers of the second kind $ B_n=\sum_{k=0}^n \left\{{n\atop k}\right\} $ The Stirling number $\left\{{n\atop k}\right\} $ is the number of ways
  to partition a set of cardinality n into exactly k nonempty subsets.
  Thus, in the equation relating the Bell numbers to the Stirling
  numbers, each partition counted on the left hand side of the equation
  is counted in exactly one of the terms of the sum on the right hand
  side, the one for which k is the number of sets in the partition. I was reading wiki and found the summation starts from $0$ instead of $1$. Is not that logically incorrect? Set partition never allowed to be empty. Can anybody clarify? Thanks :)","['combinatorics', 'elementary-set-theory']"
1727840,"Formal proof that (x,|x|) is not a smooth submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^2$","I have perused the related questions on this site, and was unable to find a formal proof of the fact stated in the title. Essentially, I have two questions: Is it a fact that if $M$ is a submanifold of $N$, there must exist an embedding of $M$ into $N$? If the above is true, how would one show that there is no embedding of $V := \{(x,|x|)\ |\ x\in \mathbb{R}\}$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$? In my attempts, I have been assuming (1) and beginning along the lines of ""suppose $u:V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ is an embedding. Then since $V$ is a one-dimensional manifold (it can be covered by the single chart $(V,(x, |x|) \mapsto x)$), it is homemorphic to $\mathbb{R}$; in particular, we can assume WLOG that a neighbourhood of $(0,0)$ is homeomorhpic to a neighbourhood of the origin of $\mathbb{R}$. We can therefore assume that (in a nbhd. of $(0,0)$), $u:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$. Then $u(x)=(x,|x|)$ necessarily..."" If my proof is right upto here, it is straightforward to then show that the derivative of $u$ vanishes and so it cannot be an embedding. I'm not sure of its correctness though, so I thought I would post here for feedback. Thanks!","['manifolds', 'differential-geometry']"

1727925,Two rifleman shooting at a target where the game ends when two hits are observed.,"The problem is as following: Person A and B are shooting at a target. Independently  of who is shooting, 
      the probability that the shot results in a hit is $p$, and each shot is independent from each other. They will shoot one by one, in the order $A,B,A,B,\dots$ until two hits are observed. Find the probability that it's the same person who got those hits. My attempts: One thing that I've noted is that the problem emphasizes independence , which is good if we would need to simplify things. My idea is like this: $$P(A{\text{ hits twice| Two hits}}) + P(B{\text{ hits twice| Two hits}})$$ I've been trying several times, by arriving at the conclusion that it's $p^2(1-p)(2-p)$ by reasoning that the above leads to ""A hit, B miss, A hit"" or ""A miss, B hit, A miss, B hit"". My only concern is that the game could continue several rounds, i.e. ""A miss, B miss, A miss, B miss, "" so it feels like we should use the binomial/Poisson distribution somehow (or geometric, or an infinite sum, etc). The answer should be as following: $$\frac{{1 - p}}{{2 - p}}$$ Does anyone know how this problem can be tackled?","['combinatorics', 'random-variables']"
1727959,Can an open set contain its supremum?,"I say the answer is no: By definition,let $A \subset \mathbb{R} $ and let $s$ be an upperbound for $A$. Then, $s=sup A$ if and only if, $\forall \epsilon>0$, $\exists a \in A$ satisfying $s-\epsilon < a$ With this in mind, and I'm having trouble stating it formally, let's assume that $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ is open, as the question states. For a contradiction, let's say that $s \in A$. Let $b$ be an upperbound for $A$. Since $s = sup A$, for an arbitrary $\epsilon$, $s + \epsilon \leq b$, but $b \notin A$. Where I am going with this is that $V_\epsilon (s)$ is not  contained in $A$, which contradicts the fact that $A$ is an open set. How is my logic and how can I improve on that?

1727989,Getting a feel for the Normal-Inverse-Wishart conjugate prior to multivariate normal distribution,"I am trying to get a feel for the Normal-Inverse-Wishart conjugate prior, which I have started to use, sparingly, in my work, where I am trying to cluster multivariate normal data. As Wikipedia helpfully points out the NIW is the conjugate prior to the MVN distribution. What I am trying to get a feel for is how the hyperparameters of the $\mathcal{NIW}(\mu, \lambda, \Psi,\nu)$ affect the cluster properties. E.g. Here is some MVN data with some clusters: What I am wondering is; if e.g. I were to use a Dirichlet-process mixture model to do some good old clustering, how do my choices of hyperparameters affect my clusters? What makes them highly discriminative (i.e. lots of them with strict boundaries)? What makes them smooth A LOT (i.e. having just say three clusters which between them classify all the data, regardless if this is correct or not)? $\mu$: I understand that it is common to set this to the sample mean, but what if you don't? $\lambda$: apparently this is the mean fraction which works as a smoothing parameter (I do not know what this means) $\Psi$: is the degrees of freedom which is set to the number of dimensions of the data (but what if I set it higher, I cannot go lower, I know that, but higher? $\nu$: is the pairwise deviation product which is set to the $D \times D$ identity matrix multiplied by a constant . But how does the choice of constant affect my clustering? Naturally I know that I could have found all of this out empirically, but I have horrendous amounts of data, so would very much appreciate some intuition about the hyperparameter set $\theta  =\{\mu, \lambda, \Psi,\nu\}$. Equally, running through the maths is obviously possible too, and I am doing that, but as the title says; I just want some advise from more experienced users.","['data-analysis', 'sampling', 'bayesian', 'machine-learning', 'statistics']"

1728056,Degree of a morphism from a curve to $\mathbb P^1_\mathbb C$: explicit description,"Let $f:X\to \mathbb P^1_{\mathbb C}$ be a non-constant (i.e. surjective) morphism (of $\mathbb C$-varieties/schemes) from a smooth complex projective curve to the projective line. The degree  of the morphism $f$ is defined ""abstractly'' as the degree of the extension between the function fields:
$$d=deg(f):=[\mathbb C (X): \mathbb C(\mathbb P^1)]=[\mathbb C (X): \mathbb C(t)]$$ Now lets embed $X$ is some $\mathbb P^N$ and try to ""get our hands dirty'' with the morphism $f$. By looking in local coordinates and in a classical pre-Grothendieck setting one can see that $f$ is given by the datum of $2$-uples of homogeneous polynomials in $N$ variables and of the same degree:
$$f\sim\{F_{0k},F_{1k}\}_k$$
satisfying certain (boring) glueing conditions. I was wondering if the degree $d$ of the morphism $f$ is equal to the degree of the polinomials $F_{ij}$. Is it true? I'm guided by the following example:

1728170,Differing definitions of a connection on a vector bundle,"My lecture notes define a connection on a vector bundle $\pi:E\rightarrow{M}$ to be an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map:

\begin{equation}
\nabla_X:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(E)

such that for $s\in\Gamma(E)$, $\nabla_Xs=\mathrm{Tr}(X\otimes\nabla{s})$, that is, the contraction of the first two components of $X\otimes\nabla{s}\in{TM}\otimes{T^*M}\otimes{E}$ (I think it's okay to omit the $\Gamma$'s here for simplicity, and that this isn't a mistake?) However, I'm trying to reconcile this definition with what I'm finding in almost every other source, which is as follows: with the same set up as above, a connection is a map 
\begin{equation}
\nabla:\Gamma(TM)\times\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(E)
\end{equation} satisfying $C^\infty$-linearity in the first component, $\mathbb{R}$-linearity in the second component, and the product rule $\nabla_X(fs)=f\nabla_X{s}+(Xf)s$ for all $f\in{C^\infty(M)}$. In this case, the image $\nabla_Xs$ of $(X,s)$ under $\nabla$ is defined to be the covariant derivative of $s$ in the direction $X$. This definition seems considerably easier to work with, so I would like to make the link between them. I imagine it might have something to do with the identification between $\mathrm{Hom}(TM,E)$ and $T^*M\otimes{E}$, but I haven't got further than that.","['tensor-products', 'connections', 'differential-geometry']"

1728712,higher dimensional Pauli matrices?,"I'm trying to find $3 \times 3$ matrices with some similarity to Pauli matrices.
I have some candidates, but they are not perfect. I'm not sure if perfect versions exist, and that is my question. Recall for Pauli matrices $p_k$:
$\{p_i,p_j\} = p_ip_j + p_jp_i = 2 \delta_{ij}$ I'm looking for matrices that satisfy:
$\{a_i,a_j,a_k\} = 3! \delta_{ijk}$
where $\{A,B,C\}$ is the sum over all permutations of three symbols:
$\{A,B,C\} = ABC + BCA + CAB + ACB + CBA + BAC$ My candidate matrices are: $a_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$
$a_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & a\\
b & 0 & 0\\
0 & c & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$
$a_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & a & 0\\
0 & 0 & b\\
c & 0 & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}$
$a_4 = \begin{bmatrix}
a & 0 & 0\\
0 & b & 0\\
0 & 0 & c\\
\end{bmatrix}$ where $a,b,c$ are the three third roots of unity (and have the property $a + b + c = 0$).
And of course, unlike Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues of these matrices are not real (they are $a,b,c$), which is expected since they are permutation matrices with $a^3 = I$. Now, they have the desired property of: $\{a_1,a_1,a_1\} = 3\\
\{a_1,a_1,a_2\} = 0\\
\{a_1,a_2,a_3\} = 0\\
\{a_1,a_3,a_4\} = 0\\ \cdots$ However: 
$\{a_2,a_3,a_4\} = -3I$ So my question is, are there a set of 4 matrices that satisfy
$\{a_i,a_j,a_k\} = 3! \delta_{ijk}$ We have 3 such matrices $a_1,a_2,a_3$, but do there exist 4?
I'm 90% sure the answer is no, but I'd like to be 100%. And we can extend the problem to higher dimensions:
For example, the $d = 4$ case. Define:
$\{A,B,C,D\}$ as the sum over all permutations of four symbols.
How many matrices can we find that satisfy:

Similarly for higher $d$, where the determinant gets even messier! eg: $d = 4, M = u*b_1 + v*b_2 + x*b_3 + y*b_4$ and $\det(M) = u^4 + v^4 + x^4 + y^4 + mess$",['matrices']
1728724,Minimizing curves are geodesics,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. I want to prove the following claim: Let $c:[0,1]\to M$ be a smooth curve from $p$ to $q$ such that $L(c)=d(p,q)$. Then $c$ is, up to reparametrization, a geodesic. And I can use the following: Fact: For each $p\in M$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that for every $q,q'\in B_\delta(p)$, there exists a unique minimizing geodesic from $q$ to $q'$. Some observations: $c$ not only minimizes the distance from $p$ to $q$ but in fact between any two points on the curve: If that were not the case, then we would have $L(\tilde c)<L(c|_{[s,t]})$ for some other curve $\tilde c$ from $c(s)$ to $c(t)$. From that we obtain $L(c|_{[0,s]}\cup \tilde{c}\cup c|_{[t,1]})<L(c)$, contradicting the assumption that $c$ is minimizing. The curve $c$ can be covered by finitely many balls of some radius $\delta>0$ as in the fact above. So for points $q$ and $q'$ within the ball there exists a minimizing geodesic connecting $q$ and $q'$. On the other hand, $c$ is a minimizing curve connecting $q$ and $q'$. Does it necessarily follow that on the segment from $q$ to $q'$, the curve $c$ coincides with the geodesic guaranteed by the fact? Any clarification is more than welcome.","['riemannian-geometry', 'differential-geometry', 'geodesic']"

1729325,How to prove that cardinality Borel $\sigma$-algebra equals the cardinality of $\mathbb R$? [duplicate],"This question already has answers here : cardinality of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra of a second countable space (2 answers) Closed 6 years ago . My understanding at this point is that to assign a probability measure to a random variable defined on the real line, we need a Borel $\mathscr{B}$ sigma algebra, because otherwise we wouldn't be able to find a bijection from every subset of the power set ($2^\Omega$) to the Lebesgue measure, due to the fact that the cardinality of $2^\Omega$ is not just greater, but much greater than the subsets of the Borel algebra. On the other hand, the Borel sigma algebra, even though it contains every number in the real line as a singleton set, has that same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$. How can this be proven? Is there a way to see this through the concept of standard topology?","['probability', 'measure-theory']"
1729327,Can we characterize the probability generating function as a linear operator?,"For a nonnegative integer-valued random variable $X$ with $\mathbb P(X=j)=p_j$, we define the probability generating function of (the distribution of) $X$ by $$P_X(s):=\mathbb E\left[s^X\right] = \sum_{j=0}^\infty p_js^j. $$ For a probability mass function $\{p_j\}$, define $\mathbb G(\{p_j\})=\mathbb E\left[s^X\right]$. Then the domain of $\mathbb G$ is $$D(\mathbb G)=\left\{\{p_j\}\in\mathbb R^{\mathbb N}: p_j\geqslant0,\ \sum_{j=0}^\infty p_j=1 \right\}. $$ Now, $D(\mathbb G)$ is not a vector space as it is not closed under addition. The most structure I have been able to find is that $D(\mathbb G)$ is that it is the $\sigma$-convex hull of the standard basis $\{e_n\}$ for $\ell^1(\mathbb R)$. For contrast, the characteristic function of (the distribution of) $X$ is well-defined as the Fourier-Stieltjes transform $$F_X\mapsto \int_{\mathbb R}e^{itx}\ \mathsf dF_X(x), $$ which is a bounded linear operator from $L^1(\mathbb R)$ to $L^\infty(\mathbb R)$. The other question is how to characterize the image of $\mathbb G$ - all I've determined so far is that it is the $\sigma$-convex hull of $\{1,s,s^2,\ldots\}$ in the set of power series which converge absolutely on $[-1,1]$, which is contained in $C^\infty_c(-1,1)$. Meanwhile, e.g. Bochner's theorem tells us that characteristic functions of probability distributions correspond uniquely to normalized positive definite continuous functions on $\mathbb C$.

Then show: $$\sum_{n_1,\dots,n_k} 4^{k-1}s_{n_1,\dots,n_k}=n\cdot n!$$ where the sum is restricted to the case where all $n_i$ are odd. I suppose we could just write $t_k$ as the number of permutations in $\Sigma_n$ composted of $k$ odd cycles, and write it as $\sum_{k} 4^{k-1}t_k = n\cdot n!$. For example, for $n=5$, the possible permutations of signature $s_{5}=4!$, $s_{1,1,3}=2\binom{5}{2}=20$, $s_{1,1,1,1,1}=1$ so the sum is: $$4^0\cdot24+4^2\cdot 20 + 4^4\cdot 1=600=5\cdot 5!$$ I have a proof of this, which is gross - it involves substituting the power series for $\theta=\arctan x$ into the power series for $\sin 4\theta$ and $\cos 4\theta$ (for odd and even $n$, respectively.)

We just switch the coordinates to get the rectangle containing all shortest taxicab paths: $$(x_1,y_1)~~(x_2,y_2)$$ $$(x_1,y_2)~~(x_2,y_1)$$ What do I know about this parallelogram on a hexagonal grid: Its angles are $\pi/3$ and $2 \pi/3$ Its larger diagonal length is equal to the Euclidean distance between the points: $$d=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc}$$ With $a=u_1-u_2$, $b=v_1-v_2$, $c=w_1-w_2$.

So, in $100$ rows, this number is $$100\times\binom 42\times25\times 25$$ Now, we can find a pair of columns in $$\binom{100}2$$ ways.

I'm not sure I see how this implies anything complex analytic at all though.. It is a known fact that if two surfaces have the same curvature at a point, they are locally isometric. Since the uniform metric gives it constant curvature, it is tempting to say they are globally isometric. I'm not quite sure that's right though. I know that for compact surfaces, I can construct fundamental domains in the disk which after taking quotients by some isometry gives the surface, but this is just another statement of uniformization, if I'm understand correctly.

Question: Is $\ell ^2$ a $G_\delta$-set in the product topology $\mathbb R ^\omega$? I am thinking the answer is no, but I'm not sure.  To prove this, I would presumably suppose $\ell ^2=\bigcap_{n\in\omega}U_n$, where each $U_n$ is open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$, and then consrtuct an element with infinite norm that is in each $U_n$. Answer: Ok, I think I've got a proof (that the answer is no). Please comment to let me know if you think it's alright. Proof. Suppose $\ell ^2=\bigcap_{n\in\omega}U_n$, where each $U_n$ is open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$. There is a basic open set $B_0$ such that $x_0:=\langle 1,0,0,...\rangle\in B_0\subseteq U_0$. Let $\text{supp}(B_0)$ be the index of the last nontrivial open subset of $\mathbb R$ that generates $B_0$, and let $\sigma_0=x_0\restriction \text{supp}(B_0)+1$. Now take a basic open $B_1$ such that $x_1:=\sigma_0^\frown \langle 1,0,0,...\rangle\in B_1\subseteq U_1$. We may assume $\text{supp}(B_1)>\text{supp}(B_0)$. Let $\sigma_1=x_1\restriction \text{supp}(B_1)+1$. Continuing this process, we construct an infinite sequence $\bigcup _{n\in\omega} \sigma_n$ which is in  every $U_n$, yet it has infinitely many $1$'s, and thus has infinite norm. That's a contradiction. $\square$ That seemed easy, so... New Question. Is $\ell ^2$ first category as a subspace of $\mathbb R ^\omega$? Answer: Yes. By comparing the usual metrics on $\ell^2$ and $\mathbb R ^\omega$, we can see that the usual topology on $\ell^2$ is finer than its topology as a subspace of $\mathbb R ^\omega$. Thus $F_n:=\{x\in \ell^2:\|x\|\leq n\}$ is closed in $\ell^2$ with the subspace topology. We show each is nowhere dense in $\ell^2$. Consider an open set $U\cap \ell^2$, where $U$ is basic open in $\mathbb R ^\omega$. Let $V=U\cap \pi_j^{-1}[(n,\infty)]$.  If $j>\text{supp}(U)$ then we have $V\neq\varnothing$. Thus $V\cap \ell^2$ is a nonempty open subset of $U\cap \ell^2$, and it misses $F_n$. This leads to a different proof that $\ell^2$ is not $G_\delta$. For if it were, it would be completely metrizable, as $\mathbb R ^\omega$ is completely metrizable and therefore so is each $G_\delta$ in it. But of course a complete metric space is not first category.","['general-topology', 'hilbert-spaces']"

Where being a regular embedding at $p$ means that the stalk of the ideal sheaf $(I_{X/Y})_p$ is generated by a regular sequence for $\mathcal{O}_{Y,p}$. There is a hint, which roughly says that we can reduce to the affine case with $\pi$ a closed immersion, say $Y = \operatorname{Spec}(B)$ and $X = \operatorname{Spec}(B/I)$. Moreover if $I_p$ is generated by the image of elements of $B$, $x_1,\dots,x_r$, then there is an open neighbourhood about $p$ where $I_q$ is also generated by the images of $(x_1,\dots, x_r)$ for all $q$ in this neighbourhood.

For the first part of the proof, here's my thinking - take a component of $G$ that contains a cycle, we'll call this component $H$. Remove $e$ from the cycle. Since $H$ is a cycle, $H - e$ is still connected, so you don't have any less components in $H - e$, and thus no fewer components in $G - e$. Therefore $e$ is not a cut edge in $G$. Am I missing anything? For the second part of the proof, I'm having a lot of trouble putting my thinking into words. Maybe I'm being afraid of simplicity. Here's my thinking - we know that $e$ is not a cut edge, which means that removing e will not change how many components G has. Removing an edge in any other circumstance will change the components of G. This is where I'm stuck. I don't think I'm explaining enough.

But then $ - w^2 A \cos w \, t - w^2 B \sin w \, t + w^2 (A \cos w \, t + B \sin w \, t) = 0 \neq \cos w \, t$. So no particular solution. Later I found out that I was supposed to guess $x_p = A t \sin w \, t$, which I have verified does work. So how was I supposed to know to guess that? Of the guess lists I've seen they only list $A \cos t + B \sin t$ as guesses. None have an extra $t$.",['ordinary-differential-equations']

1729869,Equality in Hardy's inequality via Hölder's,"I'm working on Exercise 3.14 in Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis. I was able to answer part (a): that for real $p$ satisfying $1<p<\infty$, for every function $f$ in $L^p(0,\infty)$, when $F$ is defined by
$$
F(x)=\frac{1}{x}\int_{0}^{x} f(t)~dt,
$$
then
$$
\lVert F\rVert_p\leq\frac{p}{p-1}\lVert f\rVert_p.
$$
My proof uses Rudin's suggestion to show the inequality first for nonnegative compactly supported continuous functions, and then the general case. For the nonnegative compactly supported continuous case, I used Hölder's inequality on
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} F^{p-1}(x)f(x)~dx,
$$
and I used Fatou's lemma and a density argument for the general case. What I'm stuck on is part (b): showing equality holds in Hardy's inequality only when $f$ vanishes almost everywhere. I was able to do this with the additional  assumption that $f$ is nonnegative, compactly supported, and continuous, by using the necessary and sufficient condition for equality in Hölder's. I wasn't able to extend this to the general case. Any suggestions?

1729874,Circle Permutation w/ Restrictions questions,"I was working on two permutation questions, and wasn't sure if I arrived at the correct answer. 1.)  In how many ways can a family of four (mother, father, and two children) be seated at a round table, with eight other people, so that the 
  parents are seated next to each other with one child beside each parent?(Two seatings are considered the same if one can be rotated to look like the other). The first thing I did was figure out the possible ways the family could sit: Case 1: child #2 + mother + father + child #1 Case 2: child #1 + mother + father + child #2 Case 3: child #2 + father + mother + child #1 Case 4: child #1 + father + mother + child #2 Then I treated each case as one person and I calculated the # of ways this ""one person"" could be seated with 8 other people. Because it is a round table I did $(n-1)!= (9-1)! = 8!$. Since there are four cases I concluded that the total possible ways to seat the family, given the restrictions is $8! \cdot 4$. Not sure if this is right, but I feel that two of the cases are repeats because they are seated in a round table? 2.) Six people attend the theatre together and sit in a row with exactly six seats. There is an aisle on each end of the row. Suppose one of the six is a doctor who must sit on the aisle in case she is paged.  How many ways can the people be seated together in the row with the doctor in an aisle seat? For this question, I visualized the scenario as such: |_ _ _ _ _ _|
So the doctor can either sit at the extreme left, in which case the total ways to be seated would be $5!$. Or she could be seated at the extreme right, in which case the total ways to be seated will also be $5!$. I added the two together $2 \cdot 5!$, to get a total of $240$ permutations, given the restrictions. Is that correct?

1729926,"Are Euclidean domains exactly the ones which we can define ""mod"" on?","A Euclidean domain $E$ is an integral domain where, for any $a, b \in E$, we can write: $$a = bq + r$$ with either $r = 0$ or $f(r) < f(b)$, where $f$ is the valuation function attached to $E$. Can I define the binary operation $\bmod$ such that $a \bmod b = r$ for all Euclidean domains? Will it always behave the same way as the mod function on $\mathbb{Z}$ that I'm used to? What got me wondering was the observation that I can do this on the Euclidean domain $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ by using quotient rings: $$
\begin{aligned}
\psi_{x^2 + x} &:: \mathbb{Q}[x] \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}[x]/\langle x^2 + x \rangle\\
\psi_{x^2 + x}(x^2 + x + 5) &= x^2 + x + 5 + \langle x^2 + x \rangle = 5 + \langle x^2 + x \rangle\\

If $n\ge p-1$, find a matrix of order $p$ in $G_n$. This problem appears as an exercise in Peter Schneider’s book on $p$-adic Lie groups, example 23.3, which shows that $G_n$ carries a $p$-valuation if and only if $n<p-1$. The condition $n\ge p-1$ is necessary, since a matrix $A$ of order $p$ has only $p$-th roots of unity as its eigenvalues and hence $f(X) = X^{p-1}+X^{p-2}+\dotsb+ X+1$ has to divide the characteristic polynomial of $A$. Hence, the companion matrix of $f(X)\cdot (X-1)^{n-p+1}= (X^p-1)(X-1)^{n-p}$ gives a matrix of order $p$ in $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb Z_p)$ (which even has entries in $\mathbb Z$).
