920323,uncountable number of Penrose tiling,"I am interested in Penrose tiling, though I am not an expert, so I apologize in advance. It is known that that the number of different Penrose tilings is uncountable. This may be implied from de Bruijn method, of inducing these tilings from a cross section of a regular (cubic) tiling in 5 dimensions (But maybe I am mixing here between the two areas, since it is not clear for me from de Bruijn method if the size of the tiles themselves vary for each cross-section). However, in Martin Gardner's book ‚Äú Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor ciphers ‚Äù (or PDF of first two chpters ), the author describes a way of Conway to prove ‚Äì in another way ‚Äì that the number of different Penrose tilings is uncountable. However, this method is completely unclear for me. Here is the description of Gardner for Conway's method: Conway's proof of the uncountability of Penrose patterns (Penrose had earlier proved it in a different way) can be outlined as follows. On the kite label one side of the axis of symmetry $L$ , the other $R$ (for left and right). Do the same on the dart, using $l$ and $r$ . Now pick a random point on the tiling. Record the letter that gives its location on the tile. Inflate the pattern one step, note the location of the same point in a second-generation tile and again record the letter. Continuing through higher inflations, you generate an infinite sequence of symbols that is a unique labeling of the original pattern seen, so to speak, from the selected point. [‚Ä¶] Not all possible sequences of the four symbols can be produced this way, but those that label different patterns can be shown to corespond in number with the number of points on a line. How does this method induce a bijective function to the points on the line?","['geometry', 'tiling']"

920381,Cannot find a mistake in an incorrect proof.,"I am reading an introductory book on proof-writing techniques. One of the exercises asks to demonstrate why the proof is incorrect. I spent quite a while thinking about it and still feel puzzled. $\textbf{Incorrect theorem:}$ Suppose $F$ and $G$ are families of sets. If $\cup F$ and $\cup G$ are disjoint, then so are $F$ and $G$. $\textbf{Proof:}$ (by contradiction) Suppose $\cup F$ and $\cup G$ are disjoint. Suppose $F$ and $G$ are not disjoint. Then we can choose some set $A$ such that $A \in F$ and $A \in G$. Since $A \in F$, then $A \subset \cup F$ (this result is true and was proven by me before as an exercise, so I just use it here). Similarly, since $A \in G$, every element of $A$ is in $\cup G$. But then every element of $A$ is in both $\cup F$ and $\cup G$, and this is impossible since $\cup F$ and $\cup G$ are disjoint. Thus, we have reached a contradiction, so $F$ and $G$ must be disjoint. QED. $\textbf{Note:}$ So far I have been able to come up with the following counterexample. Consider $F = \left\lbrace \emptyset, \left\lbrace 1 \right\rbrace, \left\lbrace 2 \right\rbrace, \left\lbrace 3 \right\rbrace \right\rbrace$ and $G = \left\lbrace \emptyset, \left\lbrace 4 \right\rbrace, \left\lbrace 5 \right\rbrace, \left\lbrace 6 \right\rbrace \right\rbrace$. Then $\cup F = \left\lbrace 1,2,3 \right\rbrace$ and $\cup G = \left\lbrace 4,5,6 \right\rbrace$. We see from here that $\cup F \cap \cup G = \emptyset$ but $F \cap G = \left\lbrace \emptyset \right\rbrace$ which clearly demonstrates that the fore mentioned theorem is not correct. So the proof must be erroneous as well. But still, I cannot understand from here why the proof of the theorem is not valid. Everything seems fine to me, so it is clear that I am missing something. If we look at the proof and choose $A = \emptyset$ then the statement in the end of the theorem states that every element of $A$ is in both $\cup F$ and $\cup G$. But since $A$ has no elements, then the statement $\forall x (x \in A \rightarrow (x \in \cup F \wedge x \in \cup G))$ is true, isn't it?","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory', 'proof-verification']"

In other words, on a parallelizable manifold we can also find parallel (and so, non-vanishing) differential forms of any degree up to $n$. I have the ""converse"" question. Suppose we have a globally non-vanishing form of degree $k\le n$. Does this imply any condition on the bundles (either cotangent, or its exterior powers)? What if we have $n\choose k$ independent forms? For example, it is clear that if $k=n$ the only condition is that the manifold is orientable (what does it mean in terms of bundles?). What happens for the generic order $k$? Thanks.","['exterior-algebra', 'differential-forms', 'vector-bundles', 'differential-geometry']"

Can $\sum a_n$ converge if $\lim_{n\to \infty}a_n$ does not exist? I guess the answer is yes because I know that $\sum a_n$ cannot converge if $\lim_{n\to \infty}a_n\neq 0$. Am I right? The second part of my question concerns the strategy to use to test convergence of such a series. I can test convergence of series with standard tests. But it seems I need to develop a more sophisticated approach in order to successfully deal with series like this. For example, here, should I use some sort of expansion? If yes, what kind of expansion? Thank you for your help.","['sequences-and-series', 'convergence-divergence', 'calculus']"

920493,Notion of surjective functions,"I have some issues with fully understanding the concept of surjection. For the proof of $A_{m}$ being a countable set for each m $\in$ N, then the union $A = \bigcup_{m=1}^{\infty} A_{m}$ is countable; my textbook states that we let $\beta_{m}$ be a surjection of N onto $A_{m}$ for each m $\in$ N and then define $\gamma$ : N x N -> A , $\gamma(m,n) = \beta_m(n)$. Then, it claims $\gamma$ is a surjection. If we let $a \in A$, then there is a $m \in$ N such that $a \in A_{m}$. Thus, there exists a least $n \in$ N so that $a = \beta_m
(n)$. So, it concludes that $a = \gamma(m,n)$ and thus it proves that $\gamma$ is a surjection. The fact is, why would proving $a = \gamma(m,n)$ make the function surjective? From the definition of a surjective function, if $f$: A -> B is surjective, then $\forall y \in B, \exists x\in A$ such that $f(x) = y$. In this case, how can we prove that for all $a \in A$ this will hold true? For this case, it seems that it is only for a particular $a$.","['elementary-set-theory', 'functions']"

920884,How many possible board states in 2048?,"I recently found out about the famous 2048 game . 
For those of you who don't know how it works, it consists on a 4x4 board on where tiles which are powers of 2 are placed. On every turn, you ""swipe"" the board in any of the four directions, and a 2 (90% chance) or a 4 (10% chance) are placed randomly in any of the blank spaces. If two adjacent tiles are of the same value $n$, they can be merged into a tile of value $2n$. The game starts with 14 blank spaces and 2 randomly placed tiles (following the same rules as above). I have written a considerably strong AI for it, but now I want to know how many possible different board states can be achieved (to see if the game can actually be mathematically solved). Knowing the highest tile achievable is $2^{17}$, this means each tile can be in exactly 18 distinct positions (including 'blank' or zero). This yields an upper bound of $18^{16}$ different possible board states. However, it is obvious that all positions can't be achieved (for example, a board filled of 16 tiles of the same value, or a number higher than 4 being 'isolated' from the rest. Also, only one $2^{17}$, three $2^{16}$s,  five $2^{15}$s, etc can exist at the same time on the board). Then, you can also take into account rotations and simmetries. For example, there are 480 starting positions, but if you group together those that are rotations and/or simmetries of each other, you end up with only 75 distinct and unique starting positions (computed with a simple script). Edit : the number of boards achieved after two turns I calculated and that appeared here was wrong. Giving an exact result for achievable board states is probably quite a difficult task, so I'm asking for a good upper bound for these possible states (counting groups of rotated/simmetric boards as one, if possible). Edit for clarification: I'm not asking for any AI strategy, or this question is in any way related to my AI. It's a question to get deeper knowledge of the game, that's all.","['game-theory', 'combinatorial-game-theory', 'combinatorics']"

921102,Stirling numbers and Power Group Enumeration,"The following question is  a reference request concerning a derivation
of the EGF for the Stirling numbers of the second kind by Power
Group Enumeration / Burnside's Lemma, which is $$\sum_{n\ge 0} {n\brace k} \frac{z^n}{n!}
= \frac{(\exp(z)-1)^k}{k!}.$$ The idea  is very  simple. The labelled  set partitions  that Stirling
numbers count can  be represented by placing one of $k$ colors into a
row of $n$ adjacent slots, where $n$ is the set being partitioned and $k$ gives the number of components. Hence a color signals what set the
value corresponding to the slot should belong to. The value of ${n\brace k}$ is then given by the number of orbits under
the power  group action  obtained by letting  the group acting  on the
slots  be the  identity and  the  group acting  on the  colors be  the
symmetric group  on $k$ elements $S_k.$ Now applying Burnside  we see
that the group acting on  the slots consists of one element containing $n$ fixed  points.  The admissible  assignments to these  fixed points
under a  permutation $\beta$ acting on  the colors are  those that are
fixed  points of $\beta.$ If  we have $q$ such  fixed points  we can
obtain $q^n$ valid  assignments  to  the slots  under  the  identity
permutation. We thus require  the cycle index of the  symmetric group $Z(S_k)$ with
the fixed points marked. Recall that the OGF of these cycle indices is
obtained from the combinatorial class $$\def\textsc#1{\dosc#1\csod}
\def\dosc#1#2\csod{{\rm #1{\small #2}}}
\textsc{SET}(\mathcal{A_1}\times\textsc{CYC}_1(\mathcal{W})
+ \mathcal{A_2}\times\textsc{CYC}_2(\mathcal{W})
+ \mathcal{A_3}\times\textsc{CYC}_3(\mathcal{W}) 
+ \cdots)$$ which gives $$\exp\left(a_1 w + a_2 \frac{w^2}{2} + a_3 \frac{w^3}{3} + \cdots 
\right).$$ Keeping only the marker on the fixed points we obtain $$G(w, v)
= \exp\left(v w + \frac{w^2}{2} + \frac{w^3}{3} + \cdots\right)
\\ = \exp\left(v w - w + \log\frac{1}{1-w}\right)
= \frac{e^{-w}}{1-w} e^{vw}.$$ We  now  determine  the  transformation required  of  this  generating
function. A  term $C v^q w^m$ must be transformed into $C q^n w^m.$ This gives $$\left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n G(w, v) \right|_{v=1}.$$ Observe however that  this term is a generating  function of colorings
where the term $w^k$ indexes colorings of at  most $k$ colors. That
means we  actually require the difference between  the coefficients on $w^k$ and on $w^{k-1}.$ This finally yields the formula $${n\brace k} = 
[w^k] (1-w) \left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n G(w, v) \right|_{v=1}.$$ Substituting the actual value of $G(w, v)$ and moving constants to the
front we obtain $${n\brace k} = [w^k] e^{-w}
\left.\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n e^{vw} \right|_{v=1}.$$ Introduce the generating function $$P(z) = \sum_{n\ge 0} {n\brace k} \frac{z^n}{n!}
= [w^k] e^{-w}
\left.\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{z^n}{n!} 
\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right)^n e^{vw} \right|_{v=1}.$$ Now the operator represented by the sum turns $v^q w^m$ into $$\left(1 + \frac{zq}{1!} 
+ \frac{(zq)^2}{2!}
+ \frac{(zq)^3}{3!}
+ \cdots\right) \times v^q \times w^m
= e^{zq} \times v^q \times w^m.$$ This yields for $P(z)$ that $${\large P(z) = [w^k] e^{-w}
\left. e^{\exp(z)\times v \times w}\right|_{v=1}}
\\= {\large [w^k] e^{-w} e^{\exp(z) w}
= [w^k] e^{(\exp(z)-1) w}.}$$ So that finally $$\color{#A00}{P(z)= \frac{(\exp(z)-1)^k}{k!}}.$$ This concludes the proof. The purpose of  this post is to determine as precise a reference as
possible for this  proof, taking  into account  all aspects  of the
technique used. If a precedent with an exact match could be found that
would be terrific. Post Scriptum. There is an instructive example of Power Group Enumeration at this MSE link .","['stirling-numbers', 'reference-request', 'generating-functions', 'group-theory']"

I am entirely unfamiliar with that level of math, but I was told that the theory produces algebraic values for special infinite series products at CM-points. Of note: The infinite product series (which adjusts the logarithmic spiral at $30$ degrees) has as its repeating term: $(1 + e^{-k\pi})$ , with $k$ representing the sequence of all odd integers excluding those which are divisible by five $(1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19,21,23,27,\ldots)$ . Further, the same repeating term with $k$ representing all odd integers adjusts the logarithmic spiral at $7.5$ degrees to the fourth root of $2$ . And further, the same repeating term with $k$ representing only the odd integers that are divisible by $5$ , adjusts the logarithmic spiral at $37.5$ degrees to the value of the product of the golden ratio with the fourth root of $2$ . Thanks in advance for any comments that can explain the theory of modular units, or CM-points, in a simplified manner for me, or its relation to infinite product series such as this one.","['sequences-and-series', 'number-theory']"

921712,What is A Set Raised to the 0 Power? (In Relation to the Definition of a Nullary Operation),"(I'm going to link to this Stackexchange post concerning Nullary Operations: why is a nullary operation a special element, usually 0 or 1? ) In general an operation is a function $f:S^n \to S$, where $n$ denotes the arity of the operation, and a nullary operation is a function $f:S^0 \to S$. It is clear that $S^n=S \times S \times \cdots \times S$ denotes the Cartesian product of a set with itself ($n$ times), however $S^0$ makes little sense to me. One might define $S^0=\emptyset$. At first glance, that seems like a good choice. However then a nullary operation makes no sense, since it must be a function $f: A \to B$ where $A$ and $B$ are two sets representing the domain and codomain of the function. And note a function is defined in terms of relation , where a relation is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$. So when we think of $A=S^0=\emptyset$ and $B=S$, so that we have a nullary operation $f:\emptyset \to S$, what is a a subset of $\emptyset \times S$? What even is $\emptyset \times S$? By definition of the Cartesian product,
\begin{equation}
\emptyset \times S = \{(a,b):a \in \emptyset\textrm{ and }b \in S\}.
\end{equation}
But there exists no $a \in \emptyset$! Therefore there exist no ordered pairs in our Cartesian product! Therefore $\emptyset \times S = \emptyset !$. Remember a function is a relation which is a subset of the Cartesian product. Therefore our relation is the empty set, and therefore also $f=\emptyset$. Edit : We got the definition sorted out in the comments. Thanks especially to Hayden and Christoff for their great help. In summary, we figured out that $S^0=\{()\}$, the set containing only one element, the ""empty $n$-tuple"". Then if taking $S=\{1,2,...,k\}$, then a nullary operation $f:S^0 \to S$ is a function, i.e. some subset of $S^0 \times S = \{()\} \times S$. Looking at $\{()\} \times S$, this equals $\{((),1),((),2),...,((),k)\}$. Then a function is a special subset of this, so that each element of the domain (and there is only one element, namely $()$) is paired with exactly one element of the codomain. Therefore a function would have the form $f=\{((),a)\}$ where $a$ is one of $1,2,...,k$. Thank you for your help.","['elementary-set-theory', 'abstract-algebra']"

So would this be considered ordinary? I know equations like this: $$\frac {dy}{dx} + \frac{dz}{dw} - \frac{dy}{dw} +12y = 0$$ aren't ordinary because the one independent variable ($y$ in this case) is being differentiated with respect to multiple dependent variables ($x$ and $w$).","['multivariable-calculus', 'ordinary-differential-equations', 'calculus', 'terminology']"

921965,Question from Munkres Analysis on Manifolds Inverse Function Theorem Section,"This is the first exercise in the section on the Inverse Function Theorem (section 8). Let $f:\Bbb R^2\to \Bbb R^2$ be defined by the equation $f(x,y)=(x^2-y^2,2xy)$. a) Show that it is one to one on the set containing all $(x,y)$ such that $x>0$. b) What is the image of the function on that set? c) If $g$ is the inverse function, find $Dg(0,1)!$ My question is mainly about part c.  Here is what I think needs to be done. Use the fact that $g(f(x,y))=(x,y)$ and differentiate to get $D(g(0,1))\cdot Df(\frac{1}{\sqrt2},\frac{1}{\sqrt2})=I$ Then multiply by the inverse matrix of $Df(\frac{1}{\sqrt2},\frac{1}{\sqrt2})$ to get $Dg(0,1)$.

921972,Probability that a five is seen before any of the even numbers are seen,"A fair die is repeatedly tossed. What is the probability that a five is seen before any of the even numbers are seen? I have my own solution below and just want someone to verify it. According to the problem, it means that only 1's and 3's are allowed to appear before the first five. And now suppose there are $n$ rolls before the first five. For each of the $n$ rolls, there are two possibilities of 1 or 3. Therefore, there are totally $2^n$ different outcomes before the first five. And the probability for each outcome to happen is simply $\frac{1}{6}^n$. After all, the probability of getting the five at the last is 1/6, then the probability for one fixed $n$ is 
$$
2^n \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n\frac{1}{6}
$$
Finally we sum up all the scenarios for each possible $n$ from $0$ to infinity to get
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} 2^n \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^n\frac{1}{6} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{3}}=\frac{1}{4}

922028,Arithmetic mean. Why does it work?,"I've been using the formula for the arithmetic mean all my life, but I'm not sure why it works. My current intuition is this one: The arithmetic mean is a number that when multiplied by the number of elements, gives you the sum of all the elements. Because of this fact, it can't be more than the maximum nor less than the minimum, and it should be located somewhat around the center. But I was wondering if there are other intuitions out there? Why does this formula work? If in passing you could talk about the weighted average as well, that would be nice too. Thanks","['statistics', 'arithmetic', 'means']"

So from my understanding since I used $\sec\theta$ for the substitution the triangle I am using to use this integral has a hypotenuse of $v$ or $4x$ since I initially assigned that value to b and the adjacent side of $\theta$ is $a$ or $3$ , and for the missing side  I got $\sqrt{v^2-9}$ or $\sqrt{16x^2-9}$ .
