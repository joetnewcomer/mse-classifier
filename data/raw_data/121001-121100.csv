1814467,An Euler squared sum,"Let $\mathcal{H}_n$ denote the $n$-th harmonic number. Evaluate the following sum $$\mathcal{S}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2}{n+1}$$ Here $\mathcal{H}_n^2$ is the square harmonic number, e.g $\left ( \sum \limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \right )^2$. I don't know how to tackle this. One idea of mine was the following: \begin{align*}
\mathcal{S} &=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2 \int_{0}^{1}x^n \, {\rm d}x \\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{1}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2 x^n \, {\rm d}x
\end{align*} and the last sum evaluates to ? Motivation: The series comes from this question . I tried a different approach. This is what I tried: \begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{1} \frac{\log(1+x) \log(1-x)}{1+x} \, {\rm d}x&= \int_{0}^{1}\log(1-x) \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n x^n \, {\rm d}x\\ 
 &=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n \int_{0}^{1}x^n \log(1-x) \, {\rm d}x \\ 
 &= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n \cdot \frac{\mathcal{H}_{n+1}}{n+1} \\ 
 &= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n \left ( \frac{\mathcal{H}_n + \frac{1}{n+1}}{n+1} \right )\\ 
 &= -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2}{n+1} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n}{\left ( n+1 \right )^2}
\end{align*} The right hand Euler sum appears to be elementary. I have not evaluated it though. But now we known that: $$\bbox[blue, 2pt]{\color{white}{-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2}{n+1} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n}{\left ( n+1 \right )^2} = \frac{1}{3}\log^3 2-\frac{\pi^2}{12}\log 2+\frac{\zeta(3)}{8}}}$$ from the linked question. So, I expect both of these series to have a closed form. Any help how to proceed with the first series? If anyone wishes to give a go for the second (right hand Euler sum) be my guest. Addendum: For the second Euler sum we have that: \begin{align*}
-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n}{\left ( n+1 \right )^2} &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n \int_{0}^{1}x^n \log x \, {\rm d}x\\ 
 &=\int_{0}^{1}\log x  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n x^n \, {\rm d}x \\ 
 &= \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\log (1+x) \log x}{1+x}\, {\rm d}x\\ 
 &=-\frac{\zeta(3)}{8}
\end{align*} The integral is elementary. Thus, it appears that the sum I seek evaluates to $$\frac{1}{3} \log^3 2 - \frac{\pi^2}{12} \log 2 + \frac{\zeta(3)}{8} = -\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2}{n+1} - \frac{\zeta(3)}{8}  \Rightarrow \\\\\\
\Rightarrow \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} \mathcal{H}_n^2}{n+1}= -\frac{1}{3} \log^3 2 +\frac{\pi^2}{12} \log 2 - \frac{\zeta(3)}{4}$$ Of course this is an indirect way of evaluating the sum. Any other way of tackling it?","['real-analysis', 'sequences-and-series']"

1814495,Show that a 2k regular graph has a matching of size at least k-1,"Let $H$ be a 2k-regular graph with $n=4k+1$ vertices (and thus $m=k(4k+1)$ edges).
Show that $H$ has at least k-1 independent edges (or that there exists a matching of size at least k-1 in $H$). If the former is true, remove the k-1 independent edges from $H$. Prove that the resulting graph $G$ will have a chromatic number of $\chi(G)=\Delta(G)+1$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$. I only know of an upper bound for a maximum matching which is $2mn\over n+2m$ so in this case it is true that $k-1 \le {8k^2+2k \over 2k+1}$ but this is of no interest. This paper gives a lower bound for the maximum matching which solves the first problem, but i think it must be simpler than that.","['combinatorics', 'graph-theory', 'discrete-mathematics']"

1814714,Average value of $e^{-x}$ from $0$ to $\infty$,I just signed up for this site so I hope I'm doing this right. I've been having trouble wrapping my head around the average value of the function $e^{-x}$ from 0 to $\infty$. I know that the average value of a function is: $$\bar f =\frac{\int_a^b{f(x)dx}}{\int_a^b{dx}}=\frac{\int_a^b{f(x)dx}}{b-a}$$ And when a is 0 and b is $\infty$: $$\frac{\int_0^\infty{f(x)dx}}{\int_0^\infty{dx}}$$ And taking the limit since the integral is improper: $$\lim_{b\to\infty}\frac{\int_0^b{f(x)dx}}{\int_0^b{dx}}$$ When I evaluate the average value of the function $e^{-x}$ I get a result of zero (one over infinity) by taking the following steps: $$\lim_{b\to\infty}\frac{\int_0^b{e^{-x}dx}}{\int_0^b{dx}}=\lim_{b\to\infty}\frac{-e^{-x}|_0^b}{x|_0^b}=\lim_{b\to\infty}\frac{-e^{-b}+1}{b}=0$$ While this makes some mathematical sense to me (Unless I made a mistake in which case please let me know!) I'm puzzled on how the average value of this function can be zero when all defined values of the same function are greater than zero.

  constants. To see how to use this, let us “solve” the differential equation: $$y^{\prime\prime}+9xy=0\tag{3}$$ If $(3)$ is of the type $(1)$, then we must have $$1-2a=0$$ $$2(c-1)=1$$ $$(bc)^2=9$$  $$a^2-p^2c^2=0$$ from these $4$ equations we find

$$\left(b\,c\,l^{c-1}\right)^2+\frac{a^2-p^2c^2}{l^2}=\frac{g}{v^2}\tag{6}$$
Substituting $a=\frac12$ and $l=1$ into $(6)$
$$\implies b^2c^2+\frac14 -p^2c^2=\frac{g}{v^2}\tag{7}$$ Now if $l=1$ we must have $$c=1$$
Substituting $c=1$ into $(7)$

1814734,The case for L'Hôpital's rule?,"While this may seem very subjective — and, admittedly, my own dislike of L'Hôpital's rule is not entirely devoid of subjectivity — I am looking here for argumented, factual answers. From what I understand, students in the United States, when learning calculus and limits, are provided with and encouraged to use L'Hôpital's rule very early on. As a result, based on e.g. the activity on Math.SE, the use of L'Hôpital's rule ends up being pervasive and somewhat of a reflex for many students. Assuming for once that the application of L'Hôpital is well-justified, and that the assumptions are checked, etc., this is a valid technique. However, based on my limited experience in research, this is a technique I have never seen used in ""real"" life."" I frequently see people rely on asymptotic equivalents, Taylor approximations, integral comparisons, etc; all of them tools that, AFAIK, are barely taught to high-school or undergrad students. My question, thus, is: why ? What is the rationale in promoting the (almost exclusive) usage of L'Hôpital's rule in secondary education (again, in the USA)? Are my observation wrong, and are other techniques actually emphasized as well? (based on the sample data I have, I sort of doubt it) Is there a clear advantage to teaching L'Hôpital's rule and training students to use it by default, advantage that I am missing?

Then if $x \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$, or if $y \not\in \displaystyle\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ we have $f(x, y) = 0$. If $x \in S_i$ for some $i$ then $x \not\in S_j$ for $j \neq i$, so $f(x, y) = -\phi_i (x) \phi_{i-1} (y) + \phi_i (x) \phi_{i} (y) = \phi_i(x) [\phi_{i} (y) - \phi_{i-1} (y)]$. Note that $f(0, 0) = 0$ since $0$ is not in the support of any $\phi_i$. Then if we can show that $f$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$, by the epsilon-delta definition of continuity we know that $f$ is not continuous at $(0, 0)$. Since $\int \phi_i = 1$ we know that the support for each $\phi_i$ must be non-empty. Examine the neighborhood of radius $r$ centered at $(0, 0)$. If we can show that $f$ is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r < 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$, then by extension it is unbounded on any neighborhood of radius $r \ge 1$ centered at $(0, 0)$. Then suppose $2^{-a} \le r < 2^{1-a}$. Suppose for sake of contradiction that $f$ is bounded in this neighborhood. Then let $\alpha, \beta$ be the values in $\mathbb{R}^1$ such that $f(\alpha, \beta) \ge f(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^1$ with $|(x, y) - (0, 0)| < r$. Suppose $\alpha \in S_i$. We must then have $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ or $\beta \in S_{i}$. If $\beta \in S_{i-1}$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = -\phi_i (\alpha) \phi_{i-1} (\beta)$, and if $\beta \in S_i$ then $f(\alpha, \beta) = \phi_i (\alpha) \phi_i (\beta)$. ( ~~~ I don't know how to proceed from here. I need to generate an ordered pair in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that creates a larger value for $f$, but I don't know how to judge the magnitude of $\phi_i (\alpha), \phi_i (\beta)$, or $\phi_{i-1} (\beta)$. I think I need to use $\int \phi_i = 1$, but to be totally honest I don't know what that means, or how to use it. ~~~ ) Since the $\phi_i$ are continuous, we know that the $S_i$ are collections of intervals. Then $(0, 1) \backslash \cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i$ is also a collection of intervals. We showed earlier that $f(x, y) \neq 0$ iff for some $i$ we have $x \in S_i$ and $y \in S_{i} \cup S_{i - 1}$. Then $f(x, y) \neq 0$ over a set whose closure is a collection of $2$-cells, implying by definition that the support of $f(x, y)$ is a collection of $2$-cells. Since $2$-cells are compact and the union of a collection of compact sets is compact, the support of $f(x, y)$ is compact. To show that $f$ is continuous (other than at the origin), we can examine $f$'s behavior in cases. If $x > 1$ or $x < 0$ and $y > 1$ or $y < 0$, then we can construct a disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$ centered at $(x, y)$ that does not intersect the set determined by $0 < x, y < 1$, so $f(x, y) = 0$ on this neighborhood since $\cup_{i = 1}^\infty S_i \subseteq (0, 1)$; this satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. If $x = 1$ or $y = 1$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Since $S_1$ is a collection of intervals in $\mathbb{R}^1$, it has a maximum; let it be $s$. Since $\overline{S_1} \in (1/2, 1)$, and since $\overline{S_1}$ is a collection of closed intervals, we know that $s < 1$. Then if $x = 1$ or $y = 1$, we have that $f(x, y) = 0$ on the neighborhood centered at $(x, y)$ with radius $1-s$. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $x = 0$ and $y \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $y \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' < 2^{-(i+1)}, y' \in [a, b]$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $y \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (y) = 0$ for all $y \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. Else if $y = 0$ and $x \neq 0$ then $f(x, y) = 0$. Suppose $x \in S_i$ for some $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b] \in S_i$. Then consider the region defined by $(x', y') : x' \in [a, b], y' < 2^{-i}$. We can inscribe a disk in this region centered at $(x, y)$, and we have $f(x', y') = 0$ over this region. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. On the other hand, suppose $x \not\in S_i$ for any $i$; then it is in some interval $[a, b]$ such that $\phi_i (x) = 0$ for all $x \in [a, b]$. Through a similar construction we can create a disk over which $f$ takes the value of zero alone. This satisfies the epsilon-delta definition of continuity. This shows the continuity of $f$ on all points other than $(0, 0)$.

1814905,Lower bound of DNF terms count for some symmetric boolean function,"Consider boolean function $s_n^{[r,\,n - r]}\colon \{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$ defined as follows: $$
s_n^{[r,\,n - r]}(x_1, ..., x_n) = 1 \iff |\{x_i: x_i = 1\}| \in [r,\,n - r]
$$ (in other words, $\small s_n^{[r,\,n - r]}(x) = 1$ iff $\small r \leq x_1 + \cdots + x_n \leq n - r$) The question is how to find a minimal possible count of terms (conjunctions, $\vee$) in disjunctive normal form (DNF) of $s_n^{[r,\,n - r]}$ for particular $n$ and $r$. My own thoughts on it: This function is obviously symmetric, i.e. any permutation of its input arguments $x_i$ don't change the value of function. I've found DNF for $s_n^{[r,\,n - r]}$ with exactly $\binom {n}{2r}\binom {2r}{r}$ terms in it: $$\large
     s_n^{[r,\,n - r]} = \bigvee_{\substack{1 \leqslant i_1 < \,\cdots\, < i_{2r} \leqslant n \\ \sigma_1 + \,\cdots\, + \sigma_{2r} =r }} x_{i_1}^{\sigma_1} \cdots x_{i_{2r}}^{\sigma_{2r}}.
   $$ (Here $x^\sigma$ notation means $x$ if $\sigma = 1$ and $\overline{x}$ if $\sigma = 0$) But this DNF obviously don't provide a lower bound for the count of terms. For example, for $s_3^{[1,2]}$ (i.e. $\small n = 3, r = 1$) this formula yields DNF with 6 terms: $$s_3^{[1,2]} = x_1 \overline{x_2} \vee x_1 \overline{x_3} \vee x_2 \overline{x_3} \vee \overline{x_1} x_2 \vee \overline{x_1} x_3 \vee \overline{x_2} x_3.$$ But there are DNFs for $s_3^{[1,2]}$ consisting of the lesser count of terms (3 terms):
$$
       s_3^{[1,2]} = x_1 \overline{x_2} \vee x_2 \overline{x_3} \vee \overline{x_1} x_3,\quad
       s_3^{[1,2]} = x_1 \overline{x_3} \vee x_1 \overline{x_2} \vee \overline{x_2} x_3.

1814909,Photo image to find the screen orientation,"I am trying to find the angle of tilts of a screen using projection of a circle from a source $S$. The light beam falls on the photo screen to expose it and what we get is an ellipse with major axis $a$ and minor axis $b$. The light beam is in the form of a cone so what we get is essentially an ellipse on the screen. The screen tilts with angle $\alpha$ to the vertical axis $y$ and $\beta$ with the horizontal axis $x$. Rotation about the $z$ axis does not affects the shape of the ellipse so it can be ignored for the moment. The transformed plane can be given by: $\begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1\\z_1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&\cos\alpha&\sin\alpha\\0&-\sin\alpha&\cos\alpha\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\cos\beta&0&-\sin\beta\\0&1&0\\\sin\beta&0&\cos\beta\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\cos\gamma&-\sin\gamma&0\\\sin\gamma&\cos\gamma&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}$ so ignoring $z$ and setting $\gamma = 0$ we get, $$\ x_1=x\cos\beta \ + \ y\sin\alpha \sin\beta $$
and
 $$  \ y_1=\ y\cos\alpha$$ Now on the screen $P$ is vertical axis and $Q$ is the horizontal axis, $\theta$ is the angle of semi-major axis with horizontal- $Q$. To get the same ellipse as in the projection we can use the shear transformation of an ellipse on the screen: Rotation transformation gives: $$P_1 = P\cos\theta \ - \ Q\sin\theta$$ $$P_2 = P\sin\theta \ + \ Q\cos\theta$$ substituting $P_1$ & $P_2$ in ellipse equation with $a$ & $b$ as major and minor axis followed by vertical shear transformation we can get the limits to the ellipse w.r.t angle $\theta$, which are: $\sqrt{a^2\sin^2\theta +b^2\cos^2\theta } \ $ for the horizontal axis $Q$ $\sqrt{b^2\sin^2\theta +a^2\cos^2\theta } \ $ for the vertical axis $P$ After being done with that, we do the same procedure using $x_1$ and $y_1$ to apply the transformation to a circle using equation of a circle. After the shear transformation of those equation we get the equations giving the maximum limit: $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha +a^2\sin^2\alpha \sin^2\beta } \ $ for horizontal axis $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha }\ $ for vertical axis For getting $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in terms of $\theta$ we use the above equations as the maximum extent of both the cases must be equal to get the same ellipse. so: $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha +a^2\sin^2\alpha \sin^2\beta }=\sqrt{b^2\cos^2\theta +a^2\sin^2\theta }$ and $\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\alpha }=\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta +b^2\sin^2\theta }$ Solving these equation we get: $$\alpha =\cos^{-1}\sqrt{\cos^2\theta +\frac{b}{a^2}^2\sin^2\theta }$$ $$\beta =\sin^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{\cos^2\theta \left(\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1\right)}{\sin^2\theta \left(1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}\right)-1}}$$ It turns out it is not giving the correct $\alpha$ & $\beta$ values with $\theta$ but when viewed from the point $S$ along the $z$ axis we get the following image in which the small circle is the circle that is being projected and the bigger ellipse(which would appear as a circle) is the projected ellipse on the screen when viewed from point $S$. Using the angle $\eta$, that is the angle between the vertical axis and the ellipse major axis when viewed from point $S$, in the above angle equations ($\alpha, \beta$) in the place of $\theta$ and keeping the other parameters same, we observe that it gives the correct value of $\alpha$ & $\beta$ Now in general case we cannot use this method ($\eta$) to find the angles as we would just have the screen photo image of the ellipse. Can this $\eta$ be related to $\theta$ by any means or what can be done to change the angles equation to get the correct value? I am using a software to simulate this so I can see from the source position and get the $\eta$ angle but in practical case it can not be done as we will just have the photo of the ellipse. This is being done to correct the photo(screen) plane using $\alpha$ & $\beta$ so that it can reach the ideal state if being parallel to the plane of the circle.","['3d', 'conic-sections', 'trigonometry', 'projective-geometry']"

If the number you roll is the lowest, then the amount that you pay to the winner is the absolute value of the difference between your number and his number. Additionally, if everyone rolls the same number, then no one exchanges any gold. There should be $y$ unique outcomes for which this could happen. If there are multiple winners, then the loser pays the same difference, but split up equally between the number of winners, $w$. If there are multiple losers, the winner receives the same difference, but each loser pays an equal portion to the winner. From all of this, can you develop an expected value function for this gambling game? Also, can you calculate the formula for the standard deviation of rolls for a given game? Any help is appreciated.",['probability-theory']
1815186,Is there a “nice” “constructive” field of numbers?,"I am wondering about this. I've had some interest in “constructive” mathematics, although also some rather strong opinions against those who want to insist that everything else is “wrong” in favor of it. One constructive object is the “computable real number line” as an alternative to the usual Cantor-Dedekind real number line. The computable real number line is such that the numbers on it are all “computable”, meaning you can give an algorithm (perhaps extremely long and inefficient) which will compute the number and which can be run by a Turing computer. In particular, noncomputable constants, like Chaitin's Omega, simply don't exist. The approach is appealing, since it means you can in principle , even if not in practice, write down a finite procedure involving finite (if perhaps unbounded in the accuracy you want) resources to obtain an arbitrarily-good approximation of every real number and thus they are in some sense “explicit”. However, to me it suffers from a few drawbacks. One is that various styles of completeness do not hold – even if we apply the “constructive” restriction to the things within them. For example, the bounded monotone convergence theorem – which is something that looks really intuitive when you draw illustrations on a piece of paper – fails for the computable reals even if we require sequences to themselves be computable , in the sense that we can give an algorithm which approximates the nth term arbitrarily well. (Note that a sequence of computable numbers can itself be noncomputable, e.g. the sequence of digits, taken as real numbers, of Chaitin's Omega.) Another problem is that we cannot computably test for equality – that is, there is no procedure that will let us decide if two arbitrary computable reals are equal, even though we have explicit procedures for computing them . These two results seem somewhat unsatisfactory to me. To do math on the computable reals, then, we have to introduce caveats that make things seem less natural, and I don't like that. Which makes me wonder, is there some way around these difficulties, perhaps by suitably restricting the definition of “computable"" or otherwise “constructibility”? For example, what if we limited our constructibility further to only be numbers and sequences computable by algorithms we can actually prove halt algorithmically? (They all have to be halting algorithms anyways, but here we are saying we should be able to prove they halt by an algorithm . That is, take a subset of all number and sequence and function and whatever other object-computing algorithms out there that is “nice and big enough for our use” but small enough that everything in it has its halting properties decidable by some algorithm which is valid on the entire set.) Failing that, is there some other way to achieve this? Is there any notion of constructive which, while it may not be a “computer” definition but could be something else as long as it is, at least on small scales, practically realizable (so it cannot involve any mandatory infinities or anything like that), that results in a constructively-complete subset of real numbers with decidable equality relation and so over which we can do analysis? If so, what is it, and if not, what is the proof of impossibility?","['computability', 'real-analysis', 'constructive-mathematics']"

Look at the 2nd solution on this link to view it. I think there might be a way to use group theory to solve the following IMO problem from 2007: In a mathematical competition some competitors are friends. Friendship is always mutual. Call a group of competitors a clique if each two of them are friends. (In particular, any group of fewer than two competitors is a clique.) The number of members of a clique is called its size. Given that, in this competition, the largest size of a clique is even, prove that the competitors can be arranged in two rooms such that the largest size of a clique contained in one room is the same as the largest size of a clique contained in the other room. I'm relatively new to group theory, so although I've spent a lot of time trying to solve this problem, I can't find the solution. How can it be solved? If you know of any similar problems that use group theory to produce an interesting proof for a combinatorics problem, you may post that as well.

1815322,Probability of Detecting an Event Given No Previous Detections,"I'm trying to figure out: Given a probability distribution of how likely an event is to be detected at time $t=1,t=2,t=3,t=4$ etc, what is the probability that it will be detected at t=n+1 if it is not detected at t=n. To make sure I'm doing it correctly I've attempted to do this specifically for the example of exponential decay, since the probability of it being detected in any interval is constant, so it's easy to check whether or not I got the correct solution. To attempt this I've first calculate the cumulative distribution function, CDF. The probability of no detection at t=n is then simply $1-CDF(n)$. Then using Bayes rule(where Dt=n means detection at time t=n, and Nt=n means no detection at time t=n)
$$P(Dt=n|Nt=n-1) = \frac{P(Nt=n-1|Dt=n)P(Dt=n)}{P(Nt=n-1)} $$
For something to of been detected at time t=n, it must of not been detected previously so $P(Nt=n-1|Dt=n)P(Dt=n)=1$ $$P(Dt=n|Nt=n-1) = \frac{P(Dt=n)}{P(Nt=n-1)} $$ Substiuting in $P(Nt=n-1) = 1-CDF(n-1)$
$$P(Dt=n|Nt=n-1) = \frac{P(Dt=n)}{1-CDF(n-1)} $$ However,this applied to an exponential decay does not result in $P(Dt=n|Nt=n-1)$ being constant. Could anyone point out what mistake I have made? Thank you for your time.","['statistics', 'probability']"

We seek to prove $n < 2^n$ using this information. I was shown this proof by an instructor (this might actually be the proof of the theorem itself) but I was stuck on proving the part that it can only be an injection and not a bijection. I annotate the area that confuses me and an explanation would be hugely helpful. I already know that this is provable by induction and is probably the better way but that is beyond the scope of my question at this time. Suppose we have a set $S$ such that $\#S = n$. We know that $\#P(S) = 2^n$. To prove $n < 2^n$, we aim to show there exists strictly an injection $f: S \rightarrow P(S)$. Consider the function $f(x) = \{x\}$. To prove it is injective, assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ $\implies \{x_1\} = \{x_2\}$ $\implies x_1 = x_2$, therefore $f$ is injective. Now we seek to prove it is not a bijection, by showing that such a bijection is impossible. Suppose for the sake of contradiction we do have such a bijection $g: S \rightarrow P(S)$. Let $K = \{ x \in S \mid x \notin g(x)\}$ I'm confused as to what this is? The set containing elements of $S$ that... don't get mapped to $P(S)$? Is that even possible? Is that the point? Observe that $K \in P(S)$ since $K \subseteq S$. $\exists z \in S$ such that $g(z) = K$, since $g$ is onto. $z \in K$ $\iff z \notin g(z)$ $\iff z \notin K$ What happened here?

The Python stuff is just to provide context. I know the overall trajectory of the derivation is driven by finding $\mathbf{w}$ that minimizes $RSS$.

can be simplified a little further as:
$$
2 \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{t}_n \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_n = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{x}_n^T \mathbf{w} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_n
$$ This means that if I can show that: $$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{t}_n \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_n = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{T}
$$ and that: $$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{w}} \sum_{n=1}^N \mathbf{x}_n^T \mathbf{w} \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_n = 2 \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} \mathbf{w}

So the random variable  will have the Bernoulli distribution For each pixel, this experiment is done 62271 times and so in each submatrix, it will be done 62271000 times independently. So the random variable X = Number of times that the 2 lines are run that its value can be an integer number in the range $[0,62271000]$ is the sum of a huge number ( 62271000 ) of bernoulli distributed variables and so X will have a normal distribution according to the Central limit theorem so the random variable Z : $$Z=\frac{X-np}{\sqrt{npq}}$$ Edit: (Based on the discussion between me and @Wiley in the comments) I should say that from the theoretic concepts of my model, I know that $\Delta>0$ for 2d and 3d polynomials. So the roots are real but it is their sign that determines whether the highlighted cod is needed or not For 2D Polynomials: there are 4 cases if there's at least one positive root, the highlighted code is not needed ($p=\frac{3}{4}$) if all of the roots are negative, the highlighted code is needed. ($q=\frac{1}{4}$) For 3D Polynomials: there are 8 cases if there's at least one positive root, the highlighted code is not needed ($p=\frac{7}{8}$) if all of the roots are negative, the highlighted code is needed. ($q=\frac{1}{8}$) will have a Standard normal distribution So for the 3d polynomial we have: $p=\frac{7}{8}\;,q=\frac{1}{8}$ and also $n = 62271000$, so we will have: $$Z = \frac{X-54487125}{5219}\qquad 0\le X\le 62271000\Rightarrow -10440\le Z\le 1491$$ But from now on, I thinking I'm making some mistakes. Our confidence interval is 0.25% of pixels $$0.25\times 0.01\times 5575\times 9440 = 131570$$ meaning that the number of pixels that do not fit our hypothesis should be less than 131570 If we assume that these pixels are distributed homogeneously across the whole image, then the number of pixels in each submatrix that do not fit our hypothesis should be less than: $$\frac{131570}{52628}=2.5$$ so $0\le X\le 155677.5\Rightarrow -10440\le Z\le -10410$ so our confidence interval is $-10410-(-10440)=30$ and our confidence level is 95% or 99%, means that the probability that $Z$ lies in the above range should be 0.95 or 0.99 . $$p(Z)=N(0,1)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(-\frac{z^2}{2})$$ $$p(-10440\le Z\le -10410)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-10440}^{-10410}\exp(-\frac{z^2}{2})\,dz = 0.95\; \text{or}\; 0.99$$ Then if we consider 52628 matrices as a stochastic process as a collection of 52628 (population) random variables with standard normal distribution , how many members of this process should be experimented (sample size)?","['stochastic-processes', 'sampling', 'probability-distributions', 'statistics', 'random-variables']"

A total function, on the other hand, I took to be a function whose domain would be the whole of $A$ in the aforementioned case. So these two properties (i.e. partial vs. total) seemed mutually exclusive to me. A recursive function, or so I supposed, is a function which is defined by a recursion equation (i.e. whose values are defined by previously defined values, etc). Naturally then, I always thought that a partial recursive function was just a partial function that was defined by a recursion equation (i.e. previously defined values, etc.) But now I'm being told that there are totally defined partial recursive functions?!?

Does the following equality necessarily hold?
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_a^\infty f_n(x)dx = \int_a^\infty f(x)dx$$
First, since the sequence converges unformly, we have
$$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_a^b f_n(x)dx = \int_a^b f(x)dx$$
Second, $$\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\int_a^\infty f_n(x)dx = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\left[\lim_{b\rightarrow \infty}\int_a^b f_n(x)dx\right]$$

We can define the associated vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$ of rank 2 by
$$f_*\mathcal{O}_X = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7} \oplus \mathcal{E}^*.$$ I want to compute the Chern classes $c_1$ and $c_2$ of the associated bundle $\mathcal{E}$, but I am not very familiar with that. Here is, what I get so far. Since $(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*$ is a direct sum, the Chern classes
$$c_1((f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*) = c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}) + c_1(\mathcal{E})$$ and $$c_2((f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*) = c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}).c_1(\mathcal{E}) + c_2(\mathcal{E}),$$
where $c_1(\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}).c_1(\mathcal{E})$ is the cup-product in $H^4(\mathcal{Q}_7, \mathbb{Z})$. On the other hand, I know that $(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)^*$ is the relative canonical bundle $f_*\omega_{X|\mathcal{Q}_7} = f_*K_X \otimes K_{\mathcal{Q}_7}^*$ and $K_{\mathcal{Q}_7} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{Q}_7}(-7)$.

Then the algebraic dual space $X^*$ and the dual space $X'$ coincide. My reasoning for why this is true: $X' \subseteq X^*$ is trivial. We thus need to show that $X^* \subseteq X'$ also holds. Since $X$ is a finite-dimensional normed space, we know that every linear operator on $X$ is bounded. Now consider a functional $f$ on $X$. It makes sense to speak of functionals on $X$ since $X$, as a normed space, is also a topological vector space (and hence a vector space). That is, $f \in X^*$. Now we know that $f$ is also a linear operator (since functionals are linear operators from $X$ onto $\mathbb C$) and, since $X$ is finite dimensional, $f$ is bounded, that is, $f \in X'$. We thus have that $X^* \subseteq X' $. that is, $$X^* = X'.$$ Is this argument valid? Also, what happens when $X$ is not finite-dimensional?

$$P\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i | \bigcap_{i=2}^{\infty} A_i\right)
P\left(\bigcap_{i=2}^{\infty} A_i | \bigcap_{i=3}^{\infty} A_i\right) ...
=P\left( A_1 | \bigcap_{i=2}^{\infty} A_i\right)
P\left(A_2 | \bigcap_{i=3}^{\infty} A_i\right) ...,$$
However, I am not sure what I should do to properly calculate these,
nor am I entirely sure if this was logically reasonable in terms of the
definitions of probability. Any suggestions?","['probability-theory', 'probability']"

Proof: Let $X=\cup C_i$ where $C_i$ is closed. Then define $D_{i,n}=C_i \cap [-n,n]$. Then $D_{i,n}$ is compact (closed because intersection of two closed sets, and bounded by $n$). Note that $X=\cup D_{i,n}$. Because $f$ is continuous, it maps compact sets to compact sets. So $f(X)=\cup f( D_{i,n})$ which is a countable union of closed sets. Does this look okay?

1816608,Itô-isometry in the extended case?,"It is shown when constructing the Itô-integral that if: $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty$. Then we have that Itô-isomtry: $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]=E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2]$. In the extended Itô integral, we relax the assumtion that $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty$, and instead have that: $P(\int_0^T X_t^2dt< \infty)=1$. If we are in this case, and not in the first case we have that: $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]= \infty$. But I am wondering if we have the Itô-isometry in the extended case as well?(Where both sides must now be infinity?) I have only seen the Itô-isometry proved in the elementary $L^2$-setting. A way to frame my question is this:, we know that we have the implication $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty \rightarrow E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2] <\infty$. But do we have the other implication? Here is what I mean: Part 1(this one is clear): $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty$ Now we know that: $E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2=E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty$ Part 2: $E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2]<\infty$ If we know that $E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2]<\infty$, as an extended Itô-integral, do we know that we are in the elementary setting and that also $E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]< \infty$? Or can we have the case that $P(\int_0^T X_t^2dt< \infty)=1 , E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]= \infty$, and $E[(\int_o^TX_tdB_t)^2]<\infty$, where the last is an Itô-integral in the extended case? My attempt of proof: When I tried proving this I use that in the extended case instead of $L^2$-convergence of simple functions, we have convergence in probability. By taking subsequences we are working with convergence almost surely. So I have a sequence of simple functions such that $\int_o^T|\phi_n-X_t|^2dt\rightarrow 0$ a.s. And $\int_o^T\phi_ndB\rightarrow \int_0^TX_tdB$ a.s. We know that we can use the Itô-isometry on the simple functions, so we have that $E[(\int_o^T\phi_ndB)^2]=E[\int_0^T\phi_n^2dt]$. But in order to finish I need that $E[\int_0^T\phi_n^2dt]\rightarrow E[\int_0^T X_t^2dt]$, and that $E(\int_o^T\phi_ndB)^2 \rightarrow E(\int_o^TX_tdB)^2$. But since we started with a.s.-convergence and not $L^2$-convergence, I can't see that we have this. Any ideas? Do you know if the statement holds?","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'stochastic-calculus', 'stochastic-analysis']"
1816615,Galois Group Isomorphic to $S_3$.,"Let $f \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree 3. Suppose $f$ has one real root, we want to show that $$\text{Gal}(L/\mathbb{Q}) \cong S_3,$$ where $L$ is the splitting field of $f$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible, $f(x)$ has 3 distinct roots $r_1, r_2$ and $r_3$. If we consider the discriminant, we note that $$\Delta = \prod_{i < j} (r_j - r_i)^2.$$ Since the roots $r_2$ and $r_3$ are distinct, we have that $\sqrt{\Delta} \not \in \mathbb{Q}$.The splitting field of $f$ is given by $\mathbb{Q}(r_1, \sqrt{\Delta})$. By the tower law, we have that $$[\mathbb{Q}(r_1, \sqrt{\Delta}) : \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(r_1, \sqrt{\Delta}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta}) : \mathbb{Q}] = 3 \cdot 2 =6.$$ We therefore have that the Galois group of $L/\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to $S_3$. Is this is a legitimate proof? Also, how can I generalise this result to prove that the Galois group of an irreducible polynomial of degree $p$ with $p-2$ roots is $S_p$?","['galois-theory', 'polynomials', 'abstract-algebra', 'extension-field', 'field-theory']"
