I remember first seeing this waveform in some kind of sound synthesizer, where one of the knobs for controlling shape of the sine was doing just what im looking for - gradually turning sine to sawtooth and vice versa. I tried using fourier series on a sawtooth wave, and getting a couple of first sines together, but the result doesn't have that smoothness.","['trigonometry', 'graphing-functions']"

2430593,Subtlety about an integral and its primitive,"I stumbled over a paper mentioning another paper, which gives an example of a subtle situation in integral theory (the example should be given in Jeffrey, D.J. ; Rich, A.D.: The Evaluation of Trigonome- tric Integrals Avoiding Spurious Discontinuities. In: ACM
  Transactions on Mathematical Software 20 (1994), Nr. 1, S. 124–135) where I don't have any access to.). The integral is given as: $$ I:=\int \frac{3}{5-4\,\cos(x)} \mathrm{d} x $$ Simple symbolical calculation (and ignoring the poles in $\mathbb{R}$) yields: $$ I = 2 \, \arctan\left( 3 \, \tan\left(\frac{x}{2} \right) \right) + C.$$ Ploting this with maple gives: The subtlety of this example is that the $\tan\left(\frac{x}{2} \right)$ substitution creates singularities, though the integrant itself is perfectly continuous. Therefore, we'd expect at least a continuous function as an antiderivative in theory. As I am aware that I need to introduce local constants for getting all possible antiderivates locally as with the integral of $\frac{1}{x}$  in $\mathbb{R}_{-}$ and $\mathbb{R}_{+}$, I am convinced that I can get a continuous function. My question now is: Assume that I have chosen all the contants properly, so that I ""glue"" the parts together in a continuous or even continuously differentialbe way. Is there any way to write down the formula for the antiderivate avoiding infinite many cases? EDIT: As the answer is already given as a comment, I might ask if there is a generic way how to avoid these troubles where choosing different local constants can be omitted? It seems as if one needs to choose different brances of the tangent at different places. Can this be done symbolically and automatically without worrying at all?","['continuity', 'integration', 'trigonometric-integrals']"

2430655,Second Order and Beyond for Multivariable Taylor Series,"I am looking for reasons why an engineer might want to learn about multivariable Taylor Series beyond order one. I have no problem seeing the value of single variable Taylor Series. I have quite a few uses for the first order multivariable Taylor Series: $$f(x_1,\dots,x_n)\underset{x_i\approx a_i}{\approx} f(a_1,\dots,a_n)+\sum_{i=1}^nf_{x_i}(a_1,\dots,a_n)(x-a_i).$$ I have one application of two-variable order-$n$ Taylor series: I think the derivations of higher-order Runge-Kutta formulae require it. One of the nice applications of single variable Taylor Series to engineering is the simplification of formulae. For example, in the context of beam deflection, the exact but rather cumbersome $$\delta=e\cdot \left(\sec\left(\sqrt{\frac{P}{EI}}\cdot \frac{L}{2}-1
\right)\right),$$
is well-approximated (using the Maclaurin series of $\sec x$), under reasonable assumptions, by the 'neat' $$\delta\approx \frac{ePL^2}{8EI}.$$ However, I can't envision similarly nice examples using two-variable Taylor Series. So my question is, why do engineers learn about order $n$ ($n\geq 2$)
  multivariable Taylor series? I am hoping to end up with a nice exam question for my class that isn't as boring as ""find the second order Taylor Series expansion of (some generic) $z=f(x,y)$ about $(a,b)$"".","['taylor-expansion', 'partial-derivative', 'multivariable-calculus', 'applications', 'sequences-and-series']"
2430676,Almost periodic function,"I am trying to do this problem but could figure it out. Show that $f(x) = \cos 2\pi x +\cos 2\pi \sqrt{2} x$ is almost-periodic by showing directly
  that given $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an integer $M$ such that at least one of any $M$ consecutive integers lies within $\varepsilon$ from an integral multiple of $2\pi$. The definition of almost periodic is based on the notion of relatively dense set. A set $\mathcal{F}\subset \mathbb{R}$ is relatively dense in
  $\mathbb{R}$ if there exists a constant $L>0$ such that $(x,x+L)\cap F
 \neq \emptyset$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}$. Then a bounded uniformly
  continuous function $f:\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is
  ""almost periodic"" iff for any $\varepsilon >0$, the set  $$
 \mathcal{F}_\varepsilon = \left\lbrace h\in \mathbb{R}:\sup_{x\in
> \mathbb{R}} \left|f(x+h) - f(x)\right| <\varepsilon \right\rbrace$$ is
  relatively dense in $\mathbb{R}$. My attempt is based on the observation that for $m\in \mathbb{Z}$ then 
$$ f(x+m) - f(x) = \cos(2\pi \sqrt{2} x + 2\pi \sqrt{2}m) - \cos (2\pi \sqrt{2} x)$$
and thus
$$ |f(x+m) - f(x)| \leq 2\pi\Big( \inf_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} \left|m\sqrt{2}+n\right| \Big)$$
We know that the set $\left\lbrace m\sqrt{2} + n: m,n\in \mathbb{Z}\right\rbrace$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$ (by a simple Pidgeonhole argument). Thus the problem will be soved if we can show that for any $\varepsilon>0$, the set 
$$ \mathcal{F} = \left\lbrace m\in  \mathbb{Z}: \;\text{there exists}\;n\in \mathbb{Z}\;\text{such that}\quad |m\sqrt{2}+n| < \varepsilon\right\rbrace$$
is ""relatively dense"" in $\mathbb{R}$, where relatively dense means there exists a constant $M_\varepsilon>0$ such that any interval $(x,x+M_\varepsilon)$ contains at least one element of $\mathcal{F}$. This somehow relates to the problem of approximation $\sqrt{2}$ by rational numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ but we want the set of $q$ is relatively dense. One well-known result is the Dirichlet approximation theorem, which states that  showing that any real number has a sequence of good rational approximations: in fact an immediate consequence is that for a given irrational $\alpha$, the inequality
$$\left|\alpha - \frac{p}{q}\right| < \frac{1}{q^2}$$
is satisfied by infinitely many integers $p$ and $q$. But the problem how to control the distance between two consecutive denumerators still cannot be solved. Can anyone help me?

$$ I want to show that $L^2(\Omega, \sigma(X_t)_{t \in T}, P)$ is a closed
  linear subspce of  $L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$. The part with the linear subspace is trivial since linear combinations of  $\sigma(X_t)_{t \in T}$-measurable and square integrable random variables clearly maintain the same properties. Now I want to show that the subspace is closed, i.e. if

  with the classical limit notion and not for a limit
  w.r.t. an arbitrary norm. Does this result hold for the $L^2$ limit? To summarize my questions: How can one show that $L^2(\Omega, \sigma(X_t)_{t \in T}, P)$ is closed? Does that mean that $L^2(\Omega, \sigma(X_t)_{t \in T}, P)$ is also a Hilbert space? Why?

The starting position on the arc would be called point P, here are the known/measured variables: P = initial position of point P x = x coordinate of P (longitude) y = y coordinate of P (latitude) V = velocity of point P (nautical miles / min, or nautical miles / hour) H = heading / directional angle of point P in degrees (000 = North, 180 = South) R = rate of turn of P in degrees/minute. All of those variables are known. We actually have a device that is able to calculate point P's rate of turn. See this link here for the device . We need to calculate the future X,Y positions of point P along the arc based on the variables above with respect to time. The dynamically changing variable to plug into the formula would be Time (in minutes or hours). For example: at future time T, what would be the position of P (or Px1, Py1) along the arc.

2431086,How to rigorously differentiate the square of the geodesic distance?,"Let $(M,g)$ be a Lorentzian 4-dimensional manifold, in other words, $g$ has signature $(-,+,+,+)$. If $U$ is a geodesically convex set, one defines $\sigma : U\times U\to \mathbb{R}$ in the following way: since $U$ is geodesically convex, pick $x$, then there is a unique geodesic $\gamma_{x,y} : [a,b]\to U$ connecting it to $y\in U$. In that case, $$\sigma(x,y)=\dfrac{1}{2}\int_{a}^b g(\gamma_{x,y}(t))(\gamma_{x,y}'(t),\gamma_{x,y}'(t))dt.$$ Now I want to differentiate this $\sigma$ rigorously with respect to the two parameters, namely, as a function $C^\infty(M\times M)$, in order to yield a two-point vector field. In Physics works there is a rather non-rigorous way, taking about infinitesimal variations $\delta x^\mu$ of the curve. It is clumsy, it is not rigorous, and I really don't like it. I want one rigorous way to differentiate this. My main problem is that the dependence on $x,y$ is implicit in $\gamma_{x,y}$. The result in the end will be: let $\phi^\mu$ be coordinate functions on $U$. Since this is a function on $M\times M$ we have to make a difference between the first factor and the second. Adopting the admitedely bad notation of using the first half of the greek alphabet to refer to the first factor and the second half to the second factor, differentiating along $\phi^\alpha$, we have $$g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\alpha \sigma(x,y)= (b-a)v^\beta$$ Where $v^\beta$ are the components of the tangent vector to $\gamma_{x,y}$ in the coordinate basis. This is terribly odd, I'm differentiating a map, and end up with dependence on tangent vector to a curve and also to the interval of parametrization of the curve. I need some explanation on how all this can be put on rigorous grounds to make some sense. What is going on here? How does one differentiate this two-point scalar correctly?

From the tiny understanding I have from stochastic process, all $X_{n}$ lie in the one same probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ ? From $P$ one can recover the marginal of each individual $X_{n}$ , and the probability calculated above must be dealing with $X_{n}$ and $X$ jointly? Most examples I found doing the actual proof of convergence in probability mainly deals with the case where $X$ is a constant. Then what about convergence in distribution. From van der Vaart page 258 (Asymptotic Statistics), it seems that each $X_{n}$ does not have to lie in the same probability spaces. We extend the preceding definition to a sequence of arbitrary maps $X_{n}: \Omega_{n} \mapsto \mathbb{D}$ defined on probability spaces $(\Omega_{n}, \mathcal{U}_{n}, P_{n})$ We say that a sequence of arbitrary maps $X_{n}: \Omega_{n} \mapsto \mathbb{D}$ converges in distribution to a random element $X$ if $E^{*}f(X_{n}) \rightarrow E f(X)$ for every bounded, continuous function $f: \mathbb{D} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ And yes there is the outer expectation that is defined For an arbitrary map $X: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{D}$ , $E^{*}f(X) = \inf \lbrace EU: U: \Omega \mapsto \mathbb{R} \text{, measurable, } U \geq f(X), EU \text{ exists} \rbrace $ So in the expression $E^{*}f(X_{n}) \rightarrow E f(X)$ , the $E^{*}f(X_{n})$ is defined using $P$ (where $X$ lies in the probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ I guess) or $P_{n}$ , and the $Ef(X)$ using $P$ ? Later he defines convergence in probability using outer probability, and now I again have trouble understanding $P$ is the law for $X_{n}$ or for $X$ or the joint. An arbitrary sequence of maps $X_{n}: \Omega_{n} \mapsto \mathbb{D}$ converges in probability to $X$ if $P^{*}(d(X_{n},X) > \epsilon) \rightarrow 0$ for all $\epsilon >0$ I'm trying my best to express my issue but as you can see in the writing, it is all muddy now.","['stochastic-processes', 'probability-theory', 'measure-theory']"

The longitude of Helsinki is $25$ degrees E and latitude $60$ degrees; the longitude of Seattle is $122$ degrees W and latitude $48$ degrees.

We even know that $\sqrt[3]{p}\not\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{q})$ for two distinct primes $p, q$. However, I don't know how to prove these things rigorously. In case of $\sqrt{p}\not\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{q})$, we can just set assume $\sqrt{p}=a+b\sqrt{q}$ for some $a, b\in\mathbb{Q}$ and deduce a contradiction. However, in cubic case, expansion of $(a+b\sqrt[3]{2}+c\sqrt[3]{4})^{3}$ is very complicated and even I expand this I couldn't get any contradiction by this. 
To be specific, it gives us 3 diophantine equations $$a^{3}+2b^{3}+4c^{3}+12abc=3$$
$$a^{2}b+2b^{2}c+2c^{2}a=0$$
$$ab^{2}+2bc^{2}+ca^{2}=0$$ and I don't know how to check solvability of this kind of diophantine equations (over $\mathbb{Q}$). Even if there exists a way to check solvability, I cannot convince that it can be used to prove $\sqrt[3]{p}\not\in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{q})$. So I tried to use Galois theory, but actually I don't know where to go. I assumed $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3})=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ and take a Galois closure, i.e. $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{3}, w)=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}, w)$ where $w^{3}=1$ then tried to use field norm maps.

$$\theta := \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}.$$
$$\omega(s,t):=\|x\|_{p\text{-var}[s,t]}^{1/\theta}\|y\|_{q\text{-var}[s,t]}^{1/\theta}.$$

2431991,"Is there any theory surrounding this ability to go back and forth between ""logarithms"" and ""differentiation""?","Given a real number $x>0$, define it's ""derivative"" as follows: $$x' = x \log(x).$$ We can easily show that $$(xy)' = x'y+xy'$$ for all $x,y > 0$. In particular: $$(xy)' = xy \log(xy) = xy(\log(x)+\log(y)) = xy \log(x)+xy\log(y) = x'y+xy'$$ So, we started with something, namely logarithms, that turns multiplication into addition, and we obtained something, namely ""derivatives"" in the above sense, satisfying the Leibniz law, and these are related by $x'/x = \log(x)$. This suggests that we try to go the other way. Given a function $f$ on the real line, define it's ""loogarithm"" to be $$\mathrm{loog}(f) = \frac{f'}{f},$$ where $f'$ is the ordinary derivative. If we're willing to assume $f$ is positive, then the loogarithm can be understood as the act of taking the ordinary logarithm and then differentiating. In more detail: $$\mathrm{loog}(f) = (\log(f))'.$$ So basically, $\mathrm{loog}$ is the well-known technique of logarithmic differentiation. It's straightforward to check that $$\mathrm{loog}(fg) = \mathrm{loog}(f)+\mathrm{loog}(g),$$ which is what makes that technique work, after all. The above observations generalize readily to derivations on commutative rings/fields. In particular we're given a function $\log : R \rightarrow R$ on a commutative ring satisfying $\log(xy) = \log(x)+\log(y)$ and $\log(1) = 0$, then we can get a notion of differentiation on $R$ via $x' = x \log(x)$, and it will always satisfy Leibniz. Conversely, the formula $\log(x) = x'/x$ allows us to turn anything satisfying Leibniz into a notion of logarithm that's defined for all units. Question. Is there any theory surrounding this ability to go back and forth between ""logarithms"" and ""differentiation"" in this way? It seems to be rather important. What follows is a long discussion about this kind of thing. We might try inverting $\mathrm{loog}$ to get some kind of exponentiation function. Unfortunately, unlike $\log$, the loogarithm is not invertible because differentiation does funny things. Oh well, let's just add the basepoint from which we're going to start integrating as an extra parameter $p$: $$a_p^f := a^{\int_p f}.$$ This exponentiation operator occurs in the method of integrating factors . Some of it's properties are familiar looking: $$a_p^0 = 1, \qquad a_p^{f+g} = a_p^f a_p^g, \qquad a_p^{-f} = \frac{1}{a_p^f}$$ Others look a bit strange, for example: $$a^1_p(x) = a^{x-p}$$ And I haven't been able to find anything worthwhile to say about $a_p^{fg}$. The method of integrating factors works because of the statement:
$$(e_p^f)' = f \cdot e_p^f.$$ That means that we can transform the DE $$f' + pf = q$$ into $$f'e_0^p + pfe_0^p = qe_0^p$$ which becomes $$(f e_0^p)' = qe_0^p.$$ So $$fe_0^p = f(0)+\int_0 qe_0^p$$ which yields $$f = e_0^{-p}\left(f(0)+\int_0 qe_0^p\right)$$ Going back to the idea that numbers can be ""differentiated"" via $x' = x \log(x)$, the above technique can be applied to solve equations of the form $x \log(x)+px = q.$ In particular, multiply both sides by $e^p$. We obtain: $$x' e^p + pxe^p = qe^p$$ So $(xe^p)' = qe^p.$ To finish the problem, we can use the Lambert $W$ function and this , or just define our function and call it ""integration.""

2432045,Algorithm to compute the area of a convex set in 2 dimensions,"I am interested in an algorithm to compute the area of a compact, convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, up to an error $\epsilon > 0$. I am curious about the optimal running time of such an algorithm, but I would be happy with a simple algorithm that is provably close to the optimum. Specifically, you get the set $K$ in the form of a 'membership oracle,' which, for any $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$, tells you whether or not $x \in K$ for a cost $c$. Also, assume for simplicity that $K$ is contained in a fixed compact set, say the unit disk. Now fix an error $\epsilon > 0$: what is the running time (in terms of $\epsilon$ and $c$) to find an approximate answer $A$, i.e. $|A - area(K)| < \epsilon$? Here are some simple ideas, ranked according to how fast I believe them to be: 1) generate a lattice with sufficiently small mesh size, and count how many points belong to $K$. 2) Approximate the set by a convex polygon, and compute its area. I think the last step is (in theory) reasonably quick, via triangulating the polygon and summing the area of the triangles. 3) Determine an approximate boundary of $K$, then numerically integrate over the boundary and use Green's theorem to get the area. Also, I am OK with probabilistic algorithms: for example, one can run a Monte-Carlo simulation, i.e. sample points randomly according to area measure on the unit disk, and record how many land inside $K$. This should (I think) take time $O(c/\epsilon)$ with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. (This is essentially parameter estimation for a Bernoulli r.v.) I suspect this is actually optimal. I have found papers on this topic in arbitrary dimension, and some ideas/results for 2-D, but I have been unable to find the state of the art for 2-D. I would also be interested in a proof of any lower bound on the running time. Edit 1: I have done the analysis for method 2 above, namely approximating with a convex polygon and finding the area. The running time comes out to $O(\frac{c}{\epsilon} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is pretty close to (what I expect to be) the optimum of $O(c/\epsilon)$. Edit 2: I have also done the analysis for method 1, i.e. just using a square mesh. I believe the running time comes out to $O(c \epsilon^{-2})$, which is worse than the convex polygon method. Basically this is because one has to check every square in the mesh (of which there are $\epsilon^{-2}$), while the other method 'finds' the boundary of $K$ in $-\log(\epsilon)$ time and does the area calculation on that set, which is length $\epsilon^{-1}$.","['computational-complexity', 'computational-mathematics', 'probability', 'computational-geometry']"

I am listing as many of these differences as I can think off the top of my head: measurable space --- sample space measurable set --- event almost everywhere --- almost surely (less commonly, almost certainly) measurable function --- random variable (Lebesgue) integral --- expected value $\mathscr{L}_2$-norm --- standard deviation (not exactly, but similar) $\mathscr{L}_2$-inner product --- covariance (again, not exactly) weak-$\ast$ convergence --- convergence in distribution/law ($\sigma$-)algebra --- ($\sigma$-)field Most of these probabilistic alternatives are more intuitive, except for the last one!

A smooth structure is a maximal smooth atlas, and a smooth atlas is a collection of charts whose domains cover $M$ and where any two charts $(U, \phi), (V, \psi)$ in $\mathcal{A}$ are smoothly compatible with each other. Those charts are smoothly compatible if either $U \cap V = \emptyset$ or the transition map is a diffeomorphism. Now my question is the following, in the second definition, the functions $\phi$ and $\psi$, are homeomorphisms, so they are continuous, bijective and have continuous inverse, but are they diffeomorphisms? . Are they necessarily smooth and is their inverse necessarily smooth? The definition doesn't explicitly state that they need be diffeomorphisms. If $(U, \phi)$ and $(V, \psi)$ are two charts in $\mathcal{A}$ such that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, the transition map from $\phi$ to $\psi$ is defined to be the composition $\psi \circ \phi^{-1} : \phi[U \cap V] \to \psi[U \cap V]$ So that reduces my question to the following, is $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ a diffeomorphism if and only if both $\psi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are diffeomorphisms?","['manifolds', 'smooth-manifolds', 'differential-geometry', 'differential-topology']"
2432326,How to show a function is continuous when the graph is closed.,"Let $X$, $Y$ be metric spaces and $f:X\to Y$. Then $G_f$ is closed in $X\times Y$ if and only if whenever $x_n\to x$ in $X$, $f(x_n)\to y$ in $Y$ , we have $y=f(x)$. Here $G_f=\{(x,f(x)):x \in X\}.$ We know that the graph of a continuous function from a space into a Hausorff space is closed so I think the reverse part can be proved  by this but I'm stuck to prove the ($\implies$) part.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $A \subseteq X$ be a subspace of $X$. Suppose $A$ is homeomorphic to some subspace $B \subseteq Y$ of $Y$. Let $f$ explicitly denote this homeomorphism. If $f : A \to B$ is a homeomorphism, does $f$ extend to a homeomorphism between $\text{Cl}_X(A)$ and $\text{Cl}_Y(B)$, i.e does there exist a $g : Cl_X(A) \to Cl_Y(B)$, such that $g|_{A} = f$. More generally if $A$ and $B$ are homeomorphic, does that imply that $Cl_X(A)$ and $Cl_Y(B)$ are homeomorphic? If $X$ and $Y$ are homeormorphic, then this is true, since it is a well known-theorem that  $f[Cl_X(A)] = Cl_Y(f[A] = B)$, if $f : X \to Y$ is a homeomorphism. However I can't seem to come up with a counterexample for my question, since I assume the implication is false. Edit : I know a counterexample that comes from CW Complexes, where if $(X, \xi)$ is a CW-Complex, then $\xi$ is a collection of open cells $e$, which are topological spaces homeomorphic to $\mathbb{B}^n$ the open unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Each $e \subseteq X$ is a subspace  of a haursdoff space $X$. Also a closed cell $\bar{e}$ is a topological space homeomorphic to the closed unit ball $\mathbb{\bar{B}}^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ Now in this example $Y = \mathbb{R}^n$. It is also known that for any $e \in \xi$, $Cl_X(e) \neq \bar{e} \cong {\mathbb{\bar{B}}^n} = Cl_Y(\mathbb{{B}}^n \cong e)  $ Hence $e$ and $\mathbb{B}^n$ are homeomorphic, however $Cl_X(e)$ is not homeomorphic to $Cl_Y(\mathbb{B}^n) = \mathbb{\bar{B}}^n$, since $Cl_X(e) \neq \bar{e}$ But using the above example feels like bringing a gun to a knife fight, are there any simpler counterexamples?",['general-topology']
