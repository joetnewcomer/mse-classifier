345005,"What is the maximum number of combinations with repetitions, that the sum could be the same?","Suppose I have $n$ integers (both negative and positive) and I get all combinations of $k$ elements with repetition $((n, k)) = (n + k-1, k)$ My question is: what is the maximum number of combinations, that the sum could be the same? That is, what is the maximum number of combinations with the same amount, I can get by carefully selecting the $n$ numbers.  Assuming that two combinations whose elements were the same but in a different order, are the same combination. I've been testing with 4 numbers selected such that an attempt to obtain the maximum number of combinations with the same sum. I noticed that either combining of 3 on 3 with repetition, 2 on 2 with repetition or 5 on  5, in all cases, the maximum number of combinations with the same sum, was always 3. I have never managed to fix the 4 numbers to obtain a larger number of combinations with the same amount. If this were a general rule, then the maximum number of combinations with repetition that sum the same for $n$ elements, is always $n-1$, regardless of the value of $k$. Is it true? Does anyone know where there is a general proof? Or a formula?",['combinatorics']
345008,What are norms used for?,"These two questions are quite similar to this one , so I apologise if this irritates anyone. Also, I suspect that a lot can be said in the answer, so I am really just looking for some main points (maybe a reference?). If we have a vector space $V$ with a norm $||\cdot||$ then it implies that $(V,d)$ is a metric space with metric $d(x,y)=||x-y||$. In turn, this gives access to huge parts of analysis (by using the metric to define open/closed sets, limits, continuity, etc.). But apart from inducing metrics what else are norms good for? If applicable - in how many of these uses could $d(x,0)$, where $0$ denotes additive identity of $V$, replace $||\cdot||$? If $||\cdot||$ cannot be replaced with $d(x,0)$, why? Is it maybe that homogeniety of $||\cdot||$ is particularly important? Thanks.","['normed-spaces', 'metric-spaces', 'analysis']"

345216,Deriving hyperbola equation: why can we assume vertices lie in between foci?,"I'm reading through a derivation of the standard equation of a horizontal hyperbola, and while I can follow the the algebra, I'm hung up on an assumption it makes early on: that the vertices lie in between the foci rather than ""outside""–or even directly on–them. The derivation begins like this: We define a hyperbola as the set of all points $(x, y)$ in the plane such that the absolute value of the difference 
of the distances between the foci and $(x, y)$ is a fixed value $d$. Consider a hyperbola centered at the origin, whose foci lie on the $x$-axis at $(c,0)$ and $(-c,0)$, with $c>0$. The vertices fall at $(a,0)$ and $(-a,0)$, with $a>0$. The assumption that $a<c$ is reflected in the diagram (below), and is used explicitly later on. Since we're building from the definition, rather than observing hyperbolas ""in the wild"", I'd like to know how we know this is in fact the case. I tried to prove it explicitly by considering the case where $a>c$, but didn't have much success: Because $a>c>0$, $A$ is closer to $C_2$ than it is to $C_1$. So $\left| \overline{C_1A}\right| > \left| \overline{C_2A}\right|$, which means $\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|>0$. Therefore, $\left|\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|\right|=\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|$. Making use of the definition, we see that $\left|\overline{C_1A}\right|-\left|\overline{C_2A}\right|=d$. We can calculate the above difference in distances in terms of $a$ and $c$, remembering that $a>c$ (and $a>-c$).
$$(a-(-c))-(a-c)=d\\
(a+c)-(a-c)=d\\
2c=d$$
I don't know if that's of any use, though I think it would suggest there's only one hyperbola for any two particular foci, which is certainly not true (though I wouldn't want to have to prove it). I haven't figured anything out for the case where $a=c$, but I supect my time would be better spent asking for clarification than to continue trying to push forward my own. Any help? Slight update: I see now (thanks for the help coffeemath!) that if $a>c$, then the difference in distances equals the gap between the two foci, $2c$, and that's true for every value of $a$ along the $x$-axis. So if we wanted to construct such a hyperbola using the above definition, we'd have to use $2c$ for our fixed value $d$. Though I still can't nail it down analytically, it looks like the closest you could get would the limit as $a\to c^-$. I played around with some graphs to see what happens as $a\to c^-$, and it's cool to see the hyperbola actually approach rays along the $x$-axis. I graphed a series of hyperbolas to see this: $\left(\frac{x^2}{.5}-\frac{y^2}{.5}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.75}-\frac{y^2}{.25}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.9}-\frac{y^2}{.1}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.99}-\frac{y^2}{.01}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.999}-\frac{y^2}{.001}=1\right)$, $\left(\frac{x^2}{.9999}-\frac{y^2}{.0001}=1\right)$. The blue dots are the foci. Update: Well, I think I got it nailed down.

345260,A question about Banach limits,"I'm trying to prove that there exists a multiplicative linear functional in $\ell_\infty^*$ that extends the limit funcional that is defined in $c$ (i.e., im looking for a linear functional $f \colon \ell_\infty \to \mathbb K$ such that $f( (x_n * y_n) ) = f (x_n) f(y_n)$, for every $(x_n), (y_n) \in \ell_\infty$, and such that $f((x_n)) = \lim x_n$ , if $(x_n)$ converges). I found a lot of references saying that it exists but I can't find a detailed proof. The usual Hahn-Banach approach doesn't work because I get a shift invariant functional, and thats inconsistent with multiplicavity. The references I found suggest that using ultrafilters to define the limit should work. I found this interesting proof of the reciprocal: every multiplicative linear functional in $\ell_\infty^*$ is a limit along an ultrafilter: Every multiplicative linear functional on $\ell^{\infty}$ is the limit along an ultrafilter. it assumes $\mathbb K = \mathbb R$, but I could adapt so I think (assuming I made no mistakes) it works for $\mathbb C$ as well.

345272,"When a covering map is finite and connected, there exists a loop none of whose lifts is a loop.","I've read the following exercise. Let $p:\tilde X\to X$ be finite connected covering map. Show that there exists a loop in $X$ none of whose lifts is a loop. I can't understand why it's supposed to be true. Can't I take $\tilde X=X$ and $p=\mathrm{id}_X?$ Then if I take any loop $\omega$ in $X$, I have $\omega\circ p=\omega$, so $\omega$ is its own lift. Why is it incorrect? (I'm not sure what a connected covering map is, but I think my example must satisfy this condition, whatever it means, if $X$ is connected.) Added. Here's what I've got after David Speyer's comments. First of all, we should add to the hypothesis that the degree of $p$ is not $1$. Now, there are the following two theorems. If $p:\tilde X\to X$ is a covering map, $x_0\in X,\ \tilde x_0\in p^{-1}(x_0),$ then the induced homomorphism $p_*:\pi(\tilde X,\tilde x_0)\to\pi(X,x_0)$ of the fundamental groups is a monomorphism. If $p:\tilde X\to X$ is a connected covering map, then its degree is equal to the index $[\pi_1(X,x_0):p_*(\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0))].$ Suppose every loop in $X$ has a lift that is a loop. This means that for each loop $\omega$ in $X$ there exists a loop $\tilde\omega$ in $\tilde X$ such that $\tilde\omega\circ p=\omega.$ But this means that $p_*([\tilde\omega])=[\omega],$ where $[\gamma]$ denotes the homotopy class of a loop $\gamma.$ But then $p_*$ is a group epimorphism. By the first theorem it is also a monomorphism, and so it is an isomorphism between $\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0)$ and $\pi_1(X,x_0).$ Therefore, $[\pi_1(X,x_0):p_*(\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0))]=1,$ and, by the second theorem, the degree of $p$ is $1$, a contradiction with the added hypothesis. Is this correct? I think it's probably not, because I'm not using the finiteness of $p$. The finiteness of $p$ means, according to the theorem that the index mentioned before is finite. But I can't see at all why that should be necessary. The only example I know of an infinite covering map is $e^{it}$ covering the unit circle with the real line. But here there are plenty of loops that have no ""loopy"" lifts because there are no nontrivial loops in the real line, and there are many in the circle. So if the infinity of the covering map is indeed a problem, this example doesn't show it. Re David Speyer's answer Don't the theorems work for any $\tilde x_0\in p^{-1}(x_0)?$ That is, for each such $\tilde x_0,$ we have a monomorphism $p_{*,\tilde x_0} : \pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0) \to\pi_1(X,x_0).$ If the hypotheses of the problem hold, there is, as you say, a $y\in p^{-1}(x_0)$ and a loop $\tilde\omega$ in $\tilde X$ starting and ending in $y$ such that $p\circ\tilde\omega=\omega$. Then can't I just use $p_{*,y}$ as above?","['general-topology', 'covering-spaces', 'homotopy-theory', 'algebraic-topology']"

345337,"Set theory, property of addition of natural numbers in the cardinal way","Consider the set of natural numbers $\mathbb N$. On this set we define an operation '+', as follows: for all $n,m \in \mathbb N$ we put $n+m$ to be the unique natural number $t \in \mathbb N$ such that there are $X,Y$ such that $$ X \cap Y = \emptyset, \quad X \cup Y = t, \quad X \sim n, \quad Y \sim m.$$ This is called, for obvious reasons, the ""cardinal definition"" of addition on the natural numbers. (You can assume that we already know (i.e. we've already proved) that there is such a natural number $t$, and moreover that this number is unique.) Here '$X \sim n$' means that there is a bijection between $X$ and $n$. I'm having a lot of trouble proving the following (quite elementary it seems) result: Theorem. For all $m,n,k \in \mathbb N$ we have
$$ n < m \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad n + k < m + k.$$ (Here for any natural numbers $n,m$ we use the abbreviation $n<m$ for $n \in m$.) Of course one would think that a good first approach would be to go by induction; I've tried it on $k$ but it didn't work out. Well..., it is clear that induction on $k$ 'works' assuming the fact that we already know that $n+(k+1) = (n+k) + 1$ for all natural numbers $n,k$. So it is sufficient to show the latter statement. I've found a proof for it, but ironically in the proof I (have to) use the above (unproved) theorem, namely the implication from left to right. So I'm basically stuck in a circularity. I also tried several other things, without success. Comment. You are not allowed to use any 'theorems' about the natural numbers, except for the most basic ones. For example, you may use that they form a linear order, but not much more.

A scheme is said to be regular in codimension 1 if every local ring $\mathcal{O}_x$ of $X$ of dimension one is regular. Let $X$ be noetherian, integral, separated and regular in codimension 1.

345366,Different Definitions on the Differentiability of Functions on a closed set.,"I have encountered three different definitions on the differentiablity of functions on a closed set. In the following, suppose that $\Omega\subset M$ is a (open) domain, where $M$ is a manifold. The three definitions are We say $f: \bar\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ belongs to $C^k(\bar\Omega)$, if there is a function $\tilde f\in C^k(\tilde\Omega)$ defined on a domain $\tilde \Omega \supset \Omega$ such that $f = \tilde f|_\Omega$. The function $f: \bar\Omega\to \mathbb{R}$ belongs to $C^k(\bar\Omega)$ if for each point $x\in \bar\Omega$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and a $C^k$ function $\tilde f$ defined on $U$ such that $f|_U = \tilde f|_U$. Suppose that $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of $\Omega$ and it is of $C^k$, that is for each point $x\in\partial\Omega$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and a $C^k$ diffeomorphism $\Phi: U \to V\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, where $V$ is a neighborhood of $0\in \mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\Phi(U\cap\Omega) = V\cap \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}|x^n >0\}$. Since for the part of the boundary $V\cap \{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}|x^n =0\}$, the differentiablity is easy to defined using the directional derivative. Then we say $f\in C^k(\bar\Omega)$ is for each $x\in\omega$, $f\circ\Phi^{-1}$ is of $C^k$. What's the relationship among the three definitions?","['derivatives', 'functions', 'definition']"

Measures define the process $Y_n$ differently? Are the conclusion in Billingsley's Convergence of Measures
different from the conclusion in his Probaility and Measures, in
that  the latter says an equivalent process to $Y_n$ but defined
on another probability space converges to a Wiener process weakly , while the former says $Y_n$ converges a Wiener process in probability ? (Note that convergence in probability implies weak convergence?) How are the two versions of
    functional central limit theorems from Billingsley and the version from Kallenberg related and different? How is Wikipedia's Donsker theorem related to the two versions of
functional central limit theorems from Billingsley and the version from Kallenberg? I am not able to

distribution to a Gaussian process which might not be a Wiener
process? PS: Three versions of functional central limit theorems: In Billingsley's Probability and Measures: Theorem 37.8. Suppose that $X_1,X_2,·-·$ are independent, identically  distributed random variables with mean $0$, variance
  $σ^2$, and finite fourth  moments, and define $Y_n(t), 0\leq t \leq
    1$ by  $$ Y_n(t, \omega) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} S_k(\omega),
    \text{ if }\frac{k-1}{n} < t \leq \frac{k}{n}. $$  There exist (on
  another probability space), for each n, processes $[Z_n(t): 0 \leq t
    \leq 1]$ and $[W_n(t): 0 \leq t \leq 1]$ such that the first has the
  same finite-dimensional distributions as $[Y_n(t): 0 \leq t \leq
    1]$, the second is a Brownian motion, and $P[\sup_{t\leq 1} |Z_n(i)
    - W_n(t)|  \geq \epsilon] \to 0$ for positive $\epsilon$. In Billingsley's Convergence of Measures Theorem 8.2. If $X_1, X_2,...$ are independent and identically distributed with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$, and if $Y_n$ is the
  random function. defined by $$ Y_n(t, \omega) = \frac{1}{\sigma

    \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} X_{\lfloor nt \rfloor + 1}(\omega), \quad
    0\leq t \leq 1$$  then $Y_n$ converges to the Wiener process $W$
  weakly. In Kallenberg's Foundations of Probability Theory Theorem 14.9 (functional central limit theorem, Donsker) Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be i. i. d. random variables with mean 0 and
  variance 1, and define $$ Y_n(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k \leq

  $B$ on $[0, 1]$, and let $f : D[0, 1]  \to \mathbb R$ be measurable
  and a.s. continuous at $B$. Then $f(Y_n) \to  f(B)$ in

$$ d \exp_p|_{tX}: T_{tX}T_pM \cong T_p M \longrightarrow T_{\exp_p(tX)}M = T_{c(t_0)}.$$ My question is: What is the relation between those two? The parallel transport is a linear isometry (in all dimensions), and the derivative of the exponential map is a radial isometry by the Gauss lemma (also in all dimensions), meaning
$$ \langle d \exp_p|_{tX} \cdot Y, \dot{c}(t) \rangle = \langle Y, X \rangle $$
for all $Y \in T_pM$. In two dimensions, this means that the two mappings coincide up to scaling, as there is only on orthogonal direction to the radial one. However, in higher dimensions, this is not true, i guess, though I find it hard to actually compute examples...

(I think one would never say something like ""$A$ is (not) dense in $B$"" if $A$ is not even a subset of $B$. ) First of all, $L^\infty([0,1])$ is defined as a quotient space, but $C([0,1])$ is a set of functions:
$$
C([0,1]):=\{f:[0,1]\to{\Bbb R}\mid f \  \text{is continuous}\}. \tag{1}

345779,3-manifolds fibering over the circle and mapping tori,"If $S$ is a closed connected surface and $\varphi \in \mathrm{Diff}(M)$, then we can build the mapping torus $M_\varphi = \dfrac{S \times [0,1]}{(x,0)\sim (\varphi(x),1)}$. Then we have that $ M_\varphi \to S^1$ is a fibration (it's actually a fiber bundle with fiber $S$). Now let $M$ be a closed connected $3$-manifold and $f:M \to S^1$ be a fibration (in the homotopy theoretic sense). Under which hypothesis can I say that $M$ is a fiber bundle with fiber a surface $S$? $M$ is a mapping torus for some $\varphi \in \mathrm{Diff}(S)$? Some of my thoughts: $f$ is a fibration, so we know that the fibers over any point are all homotopy equivalent. But $M$ is a closed $3$-manifold, so the fiber over a generic point will be a closed surface. Since two homotopy equivalent closed surfaces are actually diffeomorphic, fibers are ""generically"" the same. My problem is that in general $f$ can have some critical values where $f^{-1}(p)$ fails to be a surface (it is still a subspace with the same homotopy type of the generic fiber surface). If $f$ happens to be a submersion then this problem will not occur and all the fibers will be diffeomorphic. In this case, it's clear that all these surfaces can be ""packed together"" in the structure of a fiber bundle (please correct me if I'm wrong). So here the question is: is this a mapping torus for some $\varphi \in \mathrm{Diff}(S)$? My guess is this is true, because each fiber is non-separating in $M$ and $S^1 \setminus {p}$ is just an open interval $I$ whose preimage in $M$ is of the form $S \times I$, but I don't see any obvious way to recover the glueing $\varphi$.","['geometric-topology', 'low-dimensional-topology', 'differential-geometry', 'fiber-bundles', 'fibration']"

He lists some sets and states whether or not they are bounded, open, closed or perfect. My question com3es from the fact that he calls the set of all integers closed By the text a set is closed if every limit point is an element of the set itself. Naturally I understand the only limit points of the Integers to be $\infty$ and $-\infty$... however I assumed that the Integers don't contain either of these elements so I reasoned that the Integers were not closed Could someone explain why this reasoning is wrong? I presume I'm misunderstanding something... As a corollary question I was wondering which sets contain $\infty$ and/or $-\infty$ Continuing the story of my study I then assumed that I was wrong and that the Integers do in fact contain $\infty$ and $-\infty$ ( considering the set of complex and real numbers are as well considered closed I assumed that $\infty$ and $-\infty$ are elements of all these sets ) but then Rudin again talks about the set $S = \left\{\frac{1}{n} | \, n \in \mathbb{N} \right\} $ but says that $0$ is not an element (but is obviously a limit point)... I guess the confusion I have comes from the fact that I then assumed that $\infty$ is an element of the natural numbers and earlier he defines $\frac{1}{\infty} = 0$ so then $0$ should be in the set...

345889,How much do idempotent ultrafilters generate in terms of semigroups?,"It is known that the set of ultrafilters on, say, the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$, can naturally be endowed with the structure of a compact topological left semigroup (which fails to be anything nicer in quite a spectacular fashion, e.g. it is badly uncommutative and right-discontinuous). An very nice class of ultrafilters are the idempotent ones, i.e. such that $p + p = p$. That they exist is already non-trivial ( Ellis theorem ) and useful (an extremely elegant proof of Hindman's theorem ). Since the situation is non-commutative, it cannot be hoped that if $p$ and $q$ are idempotent, then $p+q$ is again idempotent. However, there are a number of properties that are (1) interesting (in my humble opinion), (2) true of idempotents (3) preserved under sums. Hence, the following question feels natural: How large is the family of ultrafilters generated by the idempotents by taking sums? What if you allow limits as well? Is it in any significant way larger than the idempotents themselves? What if instead of idempotents, one looks at other special ultrafilters? Edit: Given that the question got a few upvotes, but no answers, I thought I should mention what I know about the problem. A first motivation, and a partial (negative) result is the following. Suppose $f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ is a map. For $\alpha \in \mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$, we can consider the sequence $(f(n)\alpha)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$. For any ultrafilter $p$ there is then a well defined notion of the generalised limit (with respect to this ultrafilter) given by the rule that: $p\!-\!\lim_n f(n) \alpha = \gamma$ if and only if for any open neighbourhood $U \subset \mathbb{T}$ of $\gamma$ we have $\{ n \ : \  f(n) \alpha \in U \} \in p$ (so, $f(n) \alpha$ is close to $\gamma$ for $p$-many $n$). It turns out that if $p$ is an idempotent and $f$ is a polynomial with $f(0) = 0$, then $p\!-\!\lim_n f(n) \alpha = 0$. (It is closely related to the other question asked here ). However, this is not quite the end of the story. It is true that $$(p+q)\!-\!\lim_k f(k) \alpha = p\!-\!\lim_n q\!-\!\lim_m f(n+m) \alpha$$
which can be used to conclude that if the claim holds for two ultrafilters $p,q$, then it also holds for their sum. What is even more, the map $p \mapsto  p\!-\!\lim_n f(n) \alpha$ is continuous. The bottom line is that the mentioned fact can be generalised from the idempotents to everything one can generate by taking sums and closures.
There are the following two consequences. On one hand, if we knew something about how large is the closed sub-semigroup generated by the idempotents, there would be a result that would follow immediately. On the other hand, this shows that we surely can't generate everything, because there are ultrafilters $p$ with $p\!-\!\lim_n \alpha n \neq 0$ for any fixed $\alpha$. I would be grateful for any of the following: another reason why the idempotents don't generate all ultrafilters. any description of how much is it that the idempotents generate. answer to whether there exist ultrafilters for which it holds that $p\!-\!\lim_n f(n) \alpha = 0$ under the assumptions above, but $p$ is not generated by the idempotents. Edit: It turns out that the ultrafilters generated by the idempotents (allowing sums and limits) are still rather small fraction of the full space. In particular, if $A$ is the set of all such ultrafilters, then it takes at least $2^{\mathfrak{c}} = \# \beta \mathbb{Z}$ translates of $A$ (i.e. sets like $A+p$, $p+A$, or even $p+A+q$...).

I'm having trouble making any progress with this proof at all. I've assumed that $\mathcal P(A) \cup \mathcal P(B)= \mathcal P(A\cup B)$, and am trying to figure out some cases I can use to help me prove that either $A \subseteq B$ or $B \subseteq A$. The statement that $\mathcal P(A) \cup \mathcal P(B)= \mathcal P(A\cup B)$ seems to be somewhat useless though. I can't seem to make any inferences with it that yield any new information about any of the sets it applies to or elements therein. The only ""progress"" I seem to be able to make is that I can conclude that $A \subseteq A \cup B$, or that $B \subseteq A \cup B$, but I don't think this gives me anything I don't already know. I've tried going down the contradiction path as well but I haven't been able to find anything there either. I feel like I am missing something obvious here though...","['proof-writing', 'elementary-set-theory']"

This is good, however, and one can prove this only with basic group theory, without conjugacy classes ; I was just wondering if there was a shorter proof.","['galois-theory', 'group-theory']"
